00:00:14.287 --> 00:00:17.067
(Birds chirping)

00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:23.691
What you're hearing

00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:27.336
is the sound of a native
forest in Southern Europe.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.861
The calm, tranquil feeling
we all get is not a coincidence.

00:00:31.885 --> 00:00:34.686
We all evolved in ecosystems like this,

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.816
where the sounds of birds and insects

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.726
indicated the possibility
of food, medicines

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.336
and all the resources
we need for survival.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.510
Ecosystems and their biodiversity
still hold the key to life on this planet.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.316
I'm obsessed with this biodiversity,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.376
the magic of the infinite network,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.251
where every species depends
on others to survive.

00:00:55.275 --> 00:00:56.481
For most of my career,

00:00:56.505 --> 00:00:59.826
I focused on just one
of those fascinating connections

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.218
between insects and fungi in the soil.

00:01:02.242 --> 00:01:05.394
I longed to understand
the scale of these networks

00:01:05.418 --> 00:01:07.347
and to understand how they might help us

00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:10.776
with one of the greatest
challenges facing humanity:

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.613
our rapidly warming planet.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.926
The problem is clear.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.529
We know we need to reduce our emissions

00:01:17.553 --> 00:01:21.166
and draw the existing carbon
out of the atmosphere,

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.892
stop the damage and start the repair.

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:26.166
And this is where forests can help.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.061
Like all plants, trees capture carbon
from the atmosphere,

00:01:29.085 --> 00:01:30.402
and they use it for growth.

00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:32.355
And some of that carbon enters the soil,

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:35.767
where it can stay for hundreds
or even thousands of years.

00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:38.425
If we could stop the losses
of forests around the world,

00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:41.806
we could directly help
to cut our annual emissions.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.962
And if we could start to tip the balance
in the other direction,

00:01:44.986 --> 00:01:47.796
we might even help the repair process.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.285
But if people were really going to invest
their valuable time and energy

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:53.039
in a solution like this,

00:01:53.063 --> 00:01:55.825
we needed to comprehend
the size of this opportunity

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:59.220
and understand the impacts
that we can have as individuals.

00:01:59.525 --> 00:02:01.661
But comprehending something of this scale

00:02:01.685 --> 00:02:04.656
was a completely new challenge
for me and my colleagues.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.046
For this, we needed the knowledge
of experts all over the world.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.700
So we began building a new network.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.821
The more people we contacted,
the more data we received,

00:02:14.845 --> 00:02:17.685
and the more clearly
patterns began to emerge.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.636
With data from over 1.2 million forests,

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.166
we were able to build
new machine learning models

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.556
to predict forest
structure around the world.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.762
For the first time,

00:02:27.786 --> 00:02:32.046
we could see that our earth is home
to just over three trillion trees,

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.250
almost half of what existed
before human civilization.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.226
We could see where the different
species are distributed

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.156
and how carbon is stored
in this massive system.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.160
But this approach could also show us
something more transformative.

00:02:45.184 --> 00:02:49.306
Using the same models, we could begin
to see where trees might naturally grow

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.130
under the existing climate.

00:02:51.154 --> 00:02:52.336
And this suggested

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.326
that outside of urban
and agricultural areas,

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.780
there's 0.9 billion hectares
where trees would naturally exist.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.390
And this is room for just over
one trillion new trees.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.086
We estimated that if we could protect
these areas in the long term,

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.756
then the soils and vegetation

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.030
might capture up to 30 percent
of the excess carbon in the atmosphere,

00:03:15.054 --> 00:03:17.324
capturing decades of human emissions.

00:03:17.775 --> 00:03:22.261
We now have a wealth of ongoing research
to refine these initial estimates.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:24.356
But the scale of this potential

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.016
suggests that along with all the other
benefits these ecosystems provide,

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.456
they might also represent a valuable role
in our fight against climate change.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.778
When our research was accepted
to be published in the journal Science,

00:03:36.802 --> 00:03:40.416
nothing could have prepared us
for the media explosion that followed.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.096
Suddenly, it seemed like the whole world
was talking about the potential of trees.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.176
Under the umbrella of the UN Decade
on Ecosystem Restoration,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.796
the World Economic Forum
launched their Trillion Trees Campaign

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.806
to go alongside similar efforts
from the WWF and United Nations.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.879
Suddenly, governments and companies
all around the world

00:03:58.903 --> 00:04:02.616
were pledging their commitment
to the restoration of earth's forests.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.709
And with the job creation
that would result,

00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:09.309
the idea of a global restoration movement
was becoming a reality.

00:04:09.898 --> 00:04:12.731
But in the excitement of it all,

00:04:12.755 --> 00:04:16.896
and with the chance to make that
positive impact I'd always dreamed of,

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.666
I made some naive and stupid
mistakes in communication

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.940
that threatened the entire message.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.181
The simplicity of our message
was its strength,

00:04:26.205 --> 00:04:30.126
but it came at the expense
of nuance that is so important.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.951
And as the headlines began to emerge,

00:04:31.975 --> 00:04:34.666
I desperately just wanted
to pull them back in.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.736
Because to some, it seemed like
we were proposing restoration

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.222
as the single solution to climate change.

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:43.736
And this is the opposite
of what this movement needs.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.216
When viewed through this lens,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.716
restoration just seems
like an easy way out,

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.236
a chance for us to "offset our emissions"
by planting a few trees

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.041
and ignore the very real
and urgent challenges of cutting emissions

00:04:55.065 --> 00:04:58.115
and protecting the ecosystems
that we currently have.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.324
Restoration is not a silver bullet.

00:05:01.348 --> 00:05:03.403
There is no silver bullet.

00:05:03.427 --> 00:05:06.306
It is just one of a huge
portfolio of solutions

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.276
that we so desperately need.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.426
And this view of trees as an easy way out
is such a tempting perspective,

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.716
but it is a real threat
to the climate change movement

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.643
and to the ecosystems that still remain.

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:22.616
(Faint sounds)

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.030
This is also the sound of trees.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.799
It's a eucalyptus plantation

00:05:31.823 --> 00:05:34.896
that exists just a couple of miles
away from where we began.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.196
Notice how there were no sounds
of birds or insects.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.637
The songs of biodiversity are gone.

00:05:40.982 --> 00:05:44.326
That's because what you're hearing
is not an ecosystem.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.136
It's a monoculture
of one single tree species

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.498
planted for rapid tree growth.

00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:52.776
Along with the biodiversity
that used to live here,

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.878
this local community has now lost
the benefits those ecosystems provided,

00:05:56.902 --> 00:05:59.536
like clean water, soil fertility,

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.102
and most urgently,

00:06:01.126 --> 00:06:05.516
protection from the intense fires
that now threaten the region every summer.

00:06:05.887 --> 00:06:09.346
The UN suggests that almost half
of reforested areas around the world

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.006
are monocultures just like this,

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.717
planted for rapid timber
production or carbon capture.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.646
Just like a farm, these plantations
may be valuable for timber,

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.216
but they are not
the restoration of nature.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.416
And monocultures
are just one of the many ways

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.276
we can damage ecosystems

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.286
when we offset our emissions
without considering the local ecology

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.340
or the people that depend on it.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.906
Following these mistakes,
a second wave of articles flooded in,

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.246
warning of the risks
of restoration done wrong.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.304
And this criticism was so painful

00:06:41.328 --> 00:06:43.436
because it was entirely correct.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.629
But most of all,

00:06:44.653 --> 00:06:48.606
I was terrified that we would squander
this incredible opportunity,

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.860
because restoration has such
enormous potential for positive impact.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.301
But just like every good idea,
it only works if we get it right.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.196
But as the dust settled,

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.496
we realized that this was actually a time

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.943
when the entire movement
gained real momentum.

00:07:05.967 --> 00:07:09.776
More people than ever
were interested in global restoration,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.218
and with messages flooding in

00:07:11.242 --> 00:07:15.026
about the successes and failures
of restoration projects around the world,

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.837
we had access to the lessons
that can help us to get it right.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.036
Every new criticism offered incredible
opportunities to learn and grow.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.976
Every failed restoration example

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.946
was a lesson on how
to improve future projects.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.356
These learnings were
an entirely new source of data --

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.706
data from the real heroes
of this movement,

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.336
from the people on the ground

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.404
who were conserving and managing
ecosystems around the world.

00:07:39.428 --> 00:07:41.556
No one knows their ecosystems more,

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:45.356
and no one is more aware
of the risks of restoration done wrong

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.666
and the need for accurate
ecological information

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.756
to show the best areas to focus on,

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.946
which species can exist in those regions,

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:56.086
and what benefits those species
can provide to the community.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.840
Historically, these are questions
that have been addressed

00:07:58.864 --> 00:08:01.376
through years of rigorous trial and error.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.826
But we started wondering:

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.746
What if we fed this deep
on-the-ground knowledge

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.786
back into our machine-learning models

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.935
to learn from the thousands
of successes and failures?

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:12.750
Could this help us to identify

00:08:12.774 --> 00:08:16.011
which strategies are working
and failing around the world?

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:19.056
And about a year ago,
we started working with Google

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.376
to help build and scale this idea
into a functioning online ecosystem,

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.191
where projects from around the world
can learn and grow together.

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:29.777
By pairing Google's technology
and our models,

00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:34.106
this ever-growing network of scientists,
restoration projects, and NGOs

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:38.676
could now build the platform
that could serve the restoration movement.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.499
And I am so excited
to give you a first glimpse

00:08:41.523 --> 00:08:43.249
of what we've been working on.

00:08:43.569 --> 00:08:48.916
This is Restor, an open data platform
for the restoration movement,

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.176
providing free ecological insights

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.696
to show which species of trees, grasses,
or shrubs might exist in that region,

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.046
monitoring of projects

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:00.635
so that we can all see the developments
happening on the ground.

00:09:00.659 --> 00:09:02.342
And most importantly,

00:09:02.366 --> 00:09:05.186
for the sharing of ecological information

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.096
so that restoration organizations
can learn one another

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.550
and so that funders can find
and track projects to support.

00:09:11.574 --> 00:09:15.126
Restor is a digital
ecosystem for restoration.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.616
The more data the community uploads,
the stronger the predictions get

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.216
and the more informed
action we can all take.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.400
Putting the learnings
of thousands of projects

00:09:23.424 --> 00:09:25.964
into the hands of people everywhere.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.426
And this ecosystem is much bigger
than just planting trees.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:35.245
Trees are just the symbol
for entire ecosystem restoration.

00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:38.686
Restor is for the protection
of land so trees can recover,

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:41.919
for the amendment of soil
so vegetation can return,

00:09:41.943 --> 00:09:44.093
and for the thousands
of other approaches used

00:09:44.117 --> 00:09:46.426
to promote the health
of grasslands, peatlands,

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:51.150
and all other ecosystems that are equally
important for life on earth.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.426
Whether you want to support
a wetland conservation project

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.620
with huge carbon potential

00:09:56.644 --> 00:09:59.940
or simply find which species of plant
might exist in your garden

00:09:59.964 --> 00:10:02.246
and how much soil carbon
they could accumulate,

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:03.461
with this tool,

00:10:03.485 --> 00:10:05.246
we hope that everyone everywhere

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.500
will have a chance to engage
in the restoration movement.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.378
The word "restore" is defined

00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:13.461
as the act of returning something
back to its original state,

00:10:13.485 --> 00:10:17.716
but it's also the act of returning it
back to its original owners.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.806
The restoration of nature
is for the local biodiversity

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.146
and the communities that depend on it.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:28.217
And as that network grows,
the collective action benefits everyone.

00:10:28.241 --> 00:10:31.676
And these benefits go far beyond
the threat of climate change.

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.456
Even if climate change stopped right now,

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.046
the protection and rebuilding
of earth's biodiversity

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:41.803
would still be a top priority
because it underpins all life on earth.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.716
It can help us with all other
global threats,

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.293
including extreme
weather events, droughts,

00:10:47.317 --> 00:10:50.696
food shortages and global pandemics.

00:10:51.245 --> 00:10:53.376
But global restoration won't be easy,

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.686
and it will not be solved
by tech solutions alone.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.206
These tools can inform us,

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:03.363
but ultimately the challenge is one
that can only be addressed by us,

00:11:03.387 --> 00:11:04.919
by all of us.

00:11:04.943 --> 00:11:08.434
Just like the interdependent species
that make up natural ecosystems,

00:11:08.458 --> 00:11:11.455
we humans are deeply
dependent on one another.

00:11:11.479 --> 00:11:14.450
We need the immense network
of limitless connections,

00:11:14.474 --> 00:11:16.923
the farmers and project
leaders on the ground

00:11:16.947 --> 00:11:21.036
who need local markets and industries
to make use of sustainable products.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:25.445
The scientists, governments,
NGOs, businesses, you, me,

00:11:25.469 --> 00:11:28.500
we are all needed
to keep this movement going.

00:11:28.524 --> 00:11:32.077
We need the whole ecology of humanity.

00:11:32.919 --> 00:11:34.111
Thank you.
