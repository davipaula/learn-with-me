00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:15.701
What does it mean to be normal?

00:00:16.857 --> 00:00:18.733
And what does it mean to be sick?

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:24.544
I've asked myself this question
from the time I was about seven,

00:00:24.568 --> 00:00:27.091
when I was diagnosed
with Tourette syndrome.

00:00:27.115 --> 00:00:29.219
Tourette's is a neurological disorder

00:00:29.243 --> 00:00:34.679
characterized by stereotyped movements
I perform against my will, called tics.

00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:38.539
Now, tics are technically involuntary,

00:00:38.563 --> 00:00:41.778
in the sense that they occur
without any conscious attention

00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:43.402
or intention on my part.

00:00:44.228 --> 00:00:48.997
But there's a funny thing
about how I experience tics.

00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:53.641
They feel more unvoluntary
than involuntary,

00:00:53.665 --> 00:00:56.625
because I still feel like it's me
moving my shoulder,

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.249
not some external force.

00:00:58.696 --> 00:01:03.521
Also, I get this uncomfortable sensation,
called premonitory urge,

00:01:03.545 --> 00:01:04.915
right before tics happen,

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.323
and particularly
when I'm trying to resist them.

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:10.681
Now, I imagine most of you out there
understand what I'm saying,

00:01:10.705 --> 00:01:14.177
but unless you have Tourette's,
you probably think you can't relate.

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:17.042
But I bet you can.

00:01:17.664 --> 00:01:20.681
So, let's try a little experiment here
and see if I can give you

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:23.807
a taste of what my experience feels like.

00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:24.981
Alright, ready?

00:01:25.776 --> 00:01:27.053
Don't blink.

00:01:27.077 --> 00:01:28.688
No, really, don't blink.

00:01:28.712 --> 00:01:31.918
And besides dry eyes, what do you feel?

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.857
Phantom pressure?

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:37.103
Eyelids tingling?

00:01:37.945 --> 00:01:39.095
A need?

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.405
Are you holding your breath?

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:42.580
(Laughter)

00:01:42.604 --> 00:01:43.755
Aha.

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:44.929
(Laughter)

00:01:47.942 --> 00:01:51.458
That's approximately
what my tics feels like.

00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:56.006
Now, tics and blinking,
neurologically speaking, are not the same,

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.578
but my point is that you
don't have to have Tourette's

00:02:00.602 --> 00:02:05.601
to be able to relate to my experience
of my premonitory urges,

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:11.272
because your brain can give you
similar experiences and feelings.

00:02:12.078 --> 00:02:17.879
So, let's shift the conversation from
what it means to be normal versus sick

00:02:17.903 --> 00:02:23.181
to what it means that a majority of us
are both normal and sick.

00:02:24.697 --> 00:02:28.054
Because in the final analysis,
we're all humans

00:02:28.078 --> 00:02:32.928
whose brains provide
for a spectrum of experiences.

00:02:34.563 --> 00:02:37.309
And everything on that spectrum
of human experiences

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:41.696
is ultimately produced by brain systems

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.653
that assume a spectrum
of different states.

00:02:45.744 --> 00:02:48.419
So again, what does it mean to be normal,

00:02:48.443 --> 00:02:50.403
and what does it mean to be sick,

00:02:50.427 --> 00:02:55.442
when sickness exists on the extreme end
of a spectrum of normal?

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.578
As both a researcher who studies
differences in how individuals' brains

00:03:01.602 --> 00:03:03.372
wire and rewire themselves,

00:03:03.396 --> 00:03:06.395
and as a Touretter
with other related diagnoses,

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:11.025
I have long been fascinated
by failures of self-regulation

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.318
on the impulsive and compulsive
behavioral spectrums.

00:03:15.342 --> 00:03:19.466
Because so much of my own
experience of my own body

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.728
and my own behavior

00:03:20.752 --> 00:03:23.077
has existed all over that map.

00:03:25.561 --> 00:03:30.335
So with the spotlight
on the opioid crisis,

00:03:31.636 --> 00:03:35.056
I've really found myself
wondering lately:

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.696
Where on the spectrum
of unvoluntary behavior

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.867
do we put something like abusing
opioid painkillers or heroin?

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:51.379
By now, we all know that the opioid crisis
and epidemic is out of control.

00:03:52.084 --> 00:03:55.108
Ninety-one people die every day
in this country from overdose.

00:03:55.464 --> 00:03:58.113
And between 2002 and 2015,

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:01.733
the number of deaths from heroin
increased by a factor of six.

00:04:04.125 --> 00:04:08.664
And something about the way
that we treat addiction isn't working,

00:04:08.688 --> 00:04:10.422
at least not for everyone.

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.005
It is a fact that people
suffering from addiction

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:16.947
have lost free will

00:04:16.971 --> 00:04:23.069
when it comes to their behavior
around drugs, alcohol, food

00:04:23.093 --> 00:04:26.160
or other reward-system
stimulating behaviors.

00:04:26.792 --> 00:04:30.935
That addiction is a brain-based
disease state

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:34.022
is a medical, neurobiological reality.

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:38.149
But how we relate to that disease --

00:04:38.173 --> 00:04:43.529
indeed, how we relate to the concept
of disease when it comes to addiction --

00:04:43.553 --> 00:04:47.665
makes an enormous difference
for how we treat people with addictions.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.479
So, we tend to think of pretty much
everything we do as entirely voluntary.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.887
But it turns out
that the brain's default state

00:04:57.911 --> 00:05:03.892
is really more like a car
idling in drive than a car in park.

00:05:04.672 --> 00:05:07.180
Some of what we think we choose to do

00:05:07.204 --> 00:05:11.219
is actually things that we
have become programmed to do

00:05:11.243 --> 00:05:13.029
when the brakes are released.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.084
Have you ever joked that your brain
was running on autopilot?

00:05:20.196 --> 00:05:21.346
Guess what?

00:05:21.744 --> 00:05:23.053
It probably was.

00:05:23.871 --> 00:05:25.029
OK?

00:05:25.053 --> 00:05:30.217
And the brain's autopilot
is in a structure called the striatum.

00:05:31.903 --> 00:05:37.615
So the striatum detects
emotional and sensory motor conditions

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:46.435
and it knows to trigger
whatever behavior you have done most often

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:49.193
in the past under those same conditions.

00:05:51.546 --> 00:05:53.990
Do you know why I became a neuroscientist?

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.911
Because I wanted to learn
what made me tick.

00:05:57.935 --> 00:06:00.389
(Laughter)

00:06:00.413 --> 00:06:01.959
Thank you, thank you.

00:06:01.983 --> 00:06:03.246
(Laughter)

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.498
I've been wanting to use that one
in front of an audience for years.

00:06:06.522 --> 00:06:08.164
(Applause)

00:06:08.188 --> 00:06:11.443
So in graduate school,
I studied genetic factors

00:06:11.467 --> 00:06:15.201
that orchestrate wiring
to the striatum during development.

00:06:16.458 --> 00:06:20.003
And yes, that is my former license plate.

00:06:20.027 --> 00:06:21.439
(Laughter)

00:06:21.463 --> 00:06:23.273
And for the record, I don't recommend

00:06:23.297 --> 00:06:27.407
any PhD student get a license plate
with their thesis topic printed on it,

00:06:27.431 --> 00:06:30.104
unless they're prepared
for their experiments not to work

00:06:30.128 --> 00:06:31.299
for the next two years.

00:06:31.323 --> 00:06:32.477
(Laughter)

00:06:32.501 --> 00:06:34.108
I eventually did figure it out.

00:06:34.132 --> 00:06:39.545
So, my experiments were exploring
how miswiring in the striatum

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:41.633
relates to compulsive behaviors.

00:06:41.657 --> 00:06:44.434
Meaning, behaviors that are coerced

00:06:44.458 --> 00:06:47.835
by uncomfortable urges
you can't consciously resist.

00:06:48.165 --> 00:06:52.117
So I was really excited
when my mice developed

00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:54.379
this compulsive behavior,

00:06:54.403 --> 00:06:57.649
where they were rubbing their faces
and they couldn't seem to stop,

00:06:57.673 --> 00:06:59.601
even when they were wounding themselves.

00:06:59.625 --> 00:07:02.490
OK, excited is the wrong word,

00:07:02.514 --> 00:07:05.434
I actually felt terrible for them.

00:07:06.514 --> 00:07:10.816
I thought that they had tics,
evidence of striatal miswiring.

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:13.782
And they were compulsive,

00:07:13.806 --> 00:07:17.679
but it turned out, on further testing,

00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:22.466
that these mice showed
an aversion to interacting

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.557
and getting to know other unfamiliar mice.

00:07:24.581 --> 00:07:26.625
Which was unusual, it was unexpected.

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:29.919
The results implied that the striatum,

00:07:29.943 --> 00:07:32.942
which, for sure, is involved
in compulsive-spectrum disorders,

00:07:32.966 --> 00:07:38.128
is also involved in human
social connection and our ability to --

00:07:38.152 --> 00:07:41.113
not human social connection,
but our ability to connect.

00:07:44.387 --> 00:07:46.474
So I delved deeper,

00:07:46.498 --> 00:07:49.323
into a field called social neuroscience.

00:07:49.347 --> 00:07:51.641
And that is a newer,
interdisciplinary field,

00:07:51.665 --> 00:07:54.357
and there I found reports
that linked the striatum

00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:57.196
not just to social anomalies in mice,

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.672
but also in people.

00:07:59.458 --> 00:08:05.135
As it turns out, the social
neurochemistry in the striatum

00:08:06.243 --> 00:08:10.950
is linked to things
you've probably already heard of.

00:08:10.974 --> 00:08:12.403
Like oxytocin,

00:08:12.427 --> 00:08:16.602
which is that hormone that makes
cuddling feel all warm and fuzzy.

00:08:17.475 --> 00:08:21.083
But it also implicates
signaling at opioid receptors.

00:08:21.943 --> 00:08:24.379
There are naturally occurring
opioids in your brain

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:27.792
that are deeply linked
to social processes.

00:08:30.754 --> 00:08:35.493
Experiments with naloxone,
which blocks opioid receptors,

00:08:35.517 --> 00:08:40.851
show us just how essential
this opioid-receptor signaling is

00:08:40.875 --> 00:08:42.447
to social interaction.

00:08:45.736 --> 00:08:50.054
When people are given naloxone --
it's an ingredient in Narcan,

00:08:50.078 --> 00:08:53.362
that reverses opioid overdoses
to save lives.

00:08:53.386 --> 00:08:55.847
But when it's given to healthy people,

00:08:55.871 --> 00:08:59.537
it actually interfered
with their ability to feel connected

00:08:59.561 --> 00:09:02.373
to people they already knew
and cared about.

00:09:03.275 --> 00:09:09.156
So, something about not having
opioid-receptor binding

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.145
makes it difficult for us to feel
the rewards of social interaction.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.762
Now, for the interest of time,

00:09:15.786 --> 00:09:18.794
I've necessarily gotten rid
of some of the scientific details,

00:09:18.818 --> 00:09:20.984
but briefly, here's where we're at.

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:26.204
The effects of social disconnection
through opioid receptors,

00:09:26.228 --> 00:09:28.514
the effects of addictive drugs

00:09:28.538 --> 00:09:31.029
and the effects of abnormal
neurotransmission

00:09:31.053 --> 00:09:33.910
on involuntary movements
and compulsive behaviors

00:09:33.934 --> 00:09:36.823
all converge in the striatum.

00:09:38.839 --> 00:09:42.371
And the striatum
and opioid signaling in it

00:09:42.395 --> 00:09:45.283
has been deeply linked with loneliness.

00:09:48.877 --> 00:09:52.394
When we don't have enough signaling
at opioid receptors,

00:09:52.418 --> 00:09:58.131
we can feel alone in a room full of people
we care about and love, who love us.

00:09:58.774 --> 00:10:03.283
Social neuroscientists, like Dr. Cacioppo
at the University of Chicago,

00:10:03.307 --> 00:10:06.147
have discovered that loneliness
is very dangerous.

00:10:06.873 --> 00:10:08.133
And it predisposes people

00:10:08.157 --> 00:10:12.330
to entire spectrums
of physical and mental illnesses.

00:10:16.515 --> 00:10:19.873
Think of it like this:
when you're at your hungriest,

00:10:19.897 --> 00:10:23.103
pretty much any food
tastes amazing, right?

00:10:23.127 --> 00:10:27.847
So similarly, loneliness
creates a hunger in the brain

00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:33.063
which neurochemically hypersensitizes
our reward system.

00:10:34.355 --> 00:10:37.308
And social isolation
acts through receptors

00:10:37.332 --> 00:10:41.283
for these naturally occurring opioids
and other social neurotransmitters

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.736
to leave the striatum in a state

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.910
where its response to things
that signal reward and pleasure

00:10:47.934 --> 00:10:50.881
is completely, completely over the top.

00:10:51.307 --> 00:10:54.339
And in this state of hypersensitivity,

00:10:54.363 --> 00:10:58.577
our brains signal deep dissatisfaction.

00:10:59.976 --> 00:11:04.751
We become restless,
irritable and impulsive.

00:11:05.769 --> 00:11:09.476
And that's pretty much when I want you
to keep the bowl of Halloween chocolate

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.354
entirely across the room for me,
because I will eat it all.

00:11:12.378 --> 00:11:13.529
I will.

00:11:13.553 --> 00:11:17.219
And that brings up another thing
that makes social disconnection

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:18.687
so dangerous.

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:21.680
If we don't have the ability
to connect socially,

00:11:21.704 --> 00:11:26.545
we are so ravenous for our social
neurochemistry to be rebalanced,

00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:28.863
we're likely to seek relief from anywhere.

00:11:28.887 --> 00:11:34.728
And if that anywhere
is opioid painkillers or heroin,

00:11:34.752 --> 00:11:40.813
it is going to be a heat-seeking missile
for our social reward system.

00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:48.305
Is it any wonder people in today's world
are becoming addicted so easily?

00:11:51.022 --> 00:11:52.839
Social isolation --

00:11:56.926 --> 00:11:58.076
excuse me --

00:11:59.736 --> 00:12:01.203
contributes to relapse.

00:12:01.953 --> 00:12:06.080
Studies have shown that people
who tend to avoid relapse

00:12:06.104 --> 00:12:10.903
tend to be people who have broad,
reciprocal social relationships

00:12:10.927 --> 00:12:12.956
where they can be
of service to each other,

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.244
where they can be helpful.

00:12:14.268 --> 00:12:16.076
Being of service lets people connect.

00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:19.251
So --

00:12:21.863 --> 00:12:27.265
if we don't have the ability
to authentically connect,

00:12:27.289 --> 00:12:31.541
our society increasingly lacks
this ability to authentically connect

00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:37.355
and experience things that
are transcendent and beyond ourselves.

00:12:37.379 --> 00:12:38.977
We used to get this transcendence

00:12:39.001 --> 00:12:42.214
from a feeling of belonging
to our families and our communities.

00:12:42.238 --> 00:12:45.312
But everywhere, communities are changing.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:52.361
And social and economic disintegration
is making this harder and harder.

00:12:54.414 --> 00:12:56.970
I'm not the only person to point out

00:12:56.994 --> 00:13:00.438
that the areas in the country
most economically hard hit,

00:13:00.462 --> 00:13:03.932
where people feel most desolate
about their life's meaning,

00:13:03.956 --> 00:13:06.100
are also the places

00:13:06.124 --> 00:13:12.678
where there have been communities
most ravaged by opioids.

00:13:14.284 --> 00:13:17.752
Social isolation acts
through the brain's reward system

00:13:17.776 --> 00:13:20.776
to make this state of affairs
literally painful.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:26.030
So perhaps it's this pain,
this loneliness,

00:13:26.054 --> 00:13:29.038
this despondence

00:13:29.062 --> 00:13:32.440
that's driving so many of us
to connect with whatever we can.

00:13:33.434 --> 00:13:34.584
Like food.

00:13:35.757 --> 00:13:37.557
Like handheld electronics.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.868
And for too many people,
to drugs like heroin and fentanyl.

00:13:41.892 --> 00:13:45.625
I know someone who overdosed,
who was revived by Narcan,

00:13:46.753 --> 00:13:50.435
and she was mostly angry
that she wasn't simply allowed to die.

00:13:50.459 --> 00:13:54.657
Imagine for a second how that feels,
that state of hopelessness, OK?

00:13:55.959 --> 00:13:59.988
But the striatum is also a source of hope.

00:14:00.012 --> 00:14:03.695
Because the striatum gives us a clue
of how to bring people back.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.656
So, remember that the striatum
is our autopilot,

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.242
running our behaviors on habit,

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:14.633
and it's possible to rewire,
to reprogram that autopilot,

00:14:14.657 --> 00:14:16.338
but it involves neuroplasticity.

00:14:16.362 --> 00:14:19.085
So, neuroplasticity
is the ability of brains

00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:21.871
to reprogram themselves,

00:14:21.895 --> 00:14:24.379
and rewire themselves,
so we can learn new things.

00:14:24.403 --> 00:14:26.990
And maybe you've heard the classic
adage of plasticity:

00:14:27.014 --> 00:14:29.814
neurons that fire together, wire together.

00:14:30.323 --> 00:14:31.507
Right?

00:14:31.531 --> 00:14:35.839
So we need to practice social
connective behaviors

00:14:35.863 --> 00:14:38.966
instead of compulsive behaviors,
when we're lonely,

00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:42.728
when we are cued to remember our drug.

00:14:45.371 --> 00:14:49.458
We need neuronally firing
repeated experiences

00:14:49.482 --> 00:14:53.156
in order for the striatum to undergo
that necessary neuroplasticity

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:59.180
that allows it to take
that "go find heroin" autopilot offline.

00:14:59.204 --> 00:15:04.053
And what the convergence
of social neuroscience, addiction

00:15:04.077 --> 00:15:06.871
and compulsive-spectrum disorders
in the striatum suggests

00:15:06.895 --> 00:15:08.601
is that it's not simply enough

00:15:08.625 --> 00:15:11.640
to teach the striatum healthier
responses to compulsive urges.

00:15:12.038 --> 00:15:17.807
We need social impulses
to replace drug-cued compulsive behaviors,

00:15:17.831 --> 00:15:24.045
because we need to rebalance,
neurochemically, our social reward system.

00:15:24.069 --> 00:15:25.234
And unless that happens,

00:15:25.258 --> 00:15:27.921
we're going to be left
in a state of craving.

00:15:28.331 --> 00:15:31.807
No matter what besides our drug
we repeatedly practice doing.

00:15:37.539 --> 00:15:42.396
I believe that the solution
to the opioid crisis

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:46.045
is to explore how social
and psychospiritual interventions

00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:49.990
can act as neurotechnologies in circuits

00:15:50.014 --> 00:15:53.406
that process social
and drug-induced rewards.

00:15:54.783 --> 00:15:59.894
One possibility is to create
and study scalable tools

00:15:59.918 --> 00:16:02.403
for people to connect with one another

00:16:02.427 --> 00:16:04.029
over a mutual interest

00:16:04.053 --> 00:16:06.220
in recovery through
psychospiritual practices.

00:16:06.244 --> 00:16:09.506
And as such, psychospiritual practice
could involve anything

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:13.014
from people getting together
as megafans of touring jam bands,

00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:18.975
or parkour jams, featuring
shared experiences of vulnerability

00:16:18.999 --> 00:16:20.189
and personal growth,

00:16:20.213 --> 00:16:23.318
or more conventional things,
like recovery yoga meetups,

00:16:23.342 --> 00:16:26.208
or meetings centered
around more traditional conceptions

00:16:26.232 --> 00:16:28.080
of spiritual experiences.

00:16:28.104 --> 00:16:30.310
But whatever it is,

00:16:30.334 --> 00:16:32.934
it needs to activate

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:35.879
all of the neurotransmitter
systems in the striatum

00:16:35.903 --> 00:16:38.680
that are involved
in processing social connection.

00:16:41.411 --> 00:16:43.775
Social media can't go
deep enough for this.

00:16:43.799 --> 00:16:47.077
Social media doesn't so much
encourage us to share,

00:16:47.101 --> 00:16:48.688
as it does to compare.

00:16:48.712 --> 00:16:53.212
It's the difference between having
superficial small talk with someone

00:16:53.236 --> 00:16:57.771
and authentic, deeply connected
conversation with eye contact.

00:16:58.442 --> 00:17:01.733
And stigma also keeps us separate.

00:17:01.757 --> 00:17:05.184
There's a lot of evidence
that it keeps us sick.

00:17:05.806 --> 00:17:10.046
And stigma often makes it safer
for addicts to connect with other addicts.

00:17:10.656 --> 00:17:15.449
But recovery groups centered around
reestablishing social connections

00:17:15.473 --> 00:17:20.358
could certainly be inclusive
of people who are seeking recovery

00:17:20.382 --> 00:17:23.342
for a range of mental health problems.

00:17:24.093 --> 00:17:27.915
My point is, when we connect
around what's broken,

00:17:29.902 --> 00:17:32.830
we connect as human beings.

00:17:33.998 --> 00:17:39.924
We heal ourselves
from the compulsive self-destruction

00:17:39.948 --> 00:17:43.347
that was our response
to the pain of disconnection.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:50.371
When we think of neuropsychiatric
illnesses as a spectrum of phenomenon

00:17:50.395 --> 00:17:53.260
that are part of what make us human,

00:17:53.284 --> 00:17:56.847
then we remove the otherness of people
who struggle with self-destruction.

00:17:57.307 --> 00:18:00.712
We remove the stigma

00:18:01.924 --> 00:18:05.386
between doctors and patients
and caregivers.

00:18:05.966 --> 00:18:11.299
We put the question of what it means
to be normal versus sick

00:18:11.323 --> 00:18:14.323
back on the spectrum
of the human condition.

00:18:14.831 --> 00:18:19.841
And it is on that spectrum
where we can all connect

00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:24.007
and seek healing together,
for all of our struggles with humanness.

00:18:24.873 --> 00:18:26.436
Thank you for letting me share.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:30.515
