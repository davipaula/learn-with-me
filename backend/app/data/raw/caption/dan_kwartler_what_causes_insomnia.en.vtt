00:00:06.947 --> 00:00:08.768
What keeps you up at night?

00:00:08.768 --> 00:00:10.554
Pondering deep questions?

00:00:10.554 --> 00:00:12.221
Excitement about a big trip?

00:00:12.221 --> 00:00:14.414
Or is it stress about unfinished work,

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:15.776
an upcoming test,

00:00:15.776 --> 00:00:18.438
or a dreaded family gathering?

00:00:18.438 --> 00:00:23.110
For many people, this stress is temporary,
as its cause is quickly resolved.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.629
But what if the very thing keeping 
you awake was stress about losing sleep?

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:33.031
This seemingly unsolvable loop 
is at the heart of insomnia,

00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:36.044
the world’s most common
sleep disorder.

00:00:36.044 --> 00:00:39.126
Almost anything can cause 
the occasional restless night -

00:00:39.126 --> 00:00:40.536
a snoring partner,

00:00:40.536 --> 00:00:41.701
physical pain,

00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:43.614
or emotional distress.

00:00:43.614 --> 00:00:49.469
And extreme sleep deprivation like jetlag
can throw off your biological clock,

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.175
wreaking havoc on your sleep schedule.

00:00:52.175 --> 00:00:55.640
But in most cases, sleep deprivation 
is short-term.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.316
Eventually, exhaustion catches up 
with all of us.

00:00:59.316 --> 00:01:03.016
However, some long-term conditions
like respiratory disorders,

00:01:03.016 --> 00:01:04.857
gastrointestinal problems,

00:01:04.857 --> 00:01:08.106
and many others can overpower fatigue.

00:01:08.106 --> 00:01:10.047
And as sleepless nights pile up,

00:01:10.047 --> 00:01:14.269
the bedroom can start to carry 
associations of restless nights

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:16.050
wracked with anxiety.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.047
Come bedtime, insomniacs are stressed.

00:01:19.047 --> 00:01:23.073
So stressed their brains hijack 
the stress response system,

00:01:23.073 --> 00:01:27.388
flooding the body with 
fight-flight-or-freeze chemicals.

00:01:27.388 --> 00:01:32.175
Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormones 
course through the bloodstream,

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:34.592
increasing heart rate and blood pressure,

00:01:34.592 --> 00:01:37.676
and jolting the body into hyperarousal.

00:01:37.676 --> 00:01:41.163
In this condition, the brain is hunting 
for potential threats,

00:01:41.163 --> 00:01:46.539
making it impossible to ignore
any slight discomfort or nighttime noise.

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.362
And when insomniacs 
finally do fall asleep,

00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:52.228
the quality of their rest is compromised.

00:01:52.228 --> 00:01:55.861
Our brain’s primary source of energy 
is cerebral glucose,

00:01:55.861 --> 00:02:01.779
and in healthy sleep, our metabolism slows
to conserve this glucose for waking hours.

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:06.173
But PET studies show the adrenaline 
that prevents sleep for insomniacs

00:02:06.173 --> 00:02:09.316
also speeds up their metabolisms.

00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:12.481
While they sleep, their bodies 
are working overtime,

00:02:12.481 --> 00:02:16.063
burning through the brain’s supply 
of energy-giving glucose.

00:02:16.063 --> 00:02:19.320
This symptom of poor sleep leaves 
insomniacs

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.079
waking in a state of exhaustion,
confusion, and stress,

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.008
which starts the
process all over again.

00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:31.255
When these cycles of stress 
and restlessness last several months,

00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:34.082
they’re diagnosed as chronic insomnia.

00:02:34.082 --> 00:02:36.737
And while insomnia rarely leads to death,

00:02:36.737 --> 00:02:40.450
its chemical mechanisms are similar 
to anxiety attacks

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.306
found in those experiencing depression
and anxiety.

00:02:43.306 --> 00:02:46.063
So suffering from 
any one of these conditions

00:02:46.063 --> 00:02:49.715
increases your risk of
experiencing the other two.

00:02:49.715 --> 00:02:53.671
Fortunately, there are ways to break 
the cycle of sleeplessness.

00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:56.224
Managing the stress that leads 
to hyperarousal

00:02:56.224 --> 00:02:59.647
is one of our best-understood treatments 
for insomnia,

00:02:59.647 --> 00:03:04.036
and good sleep practices can help rebuild 
your relationship with bedtime.

00:03:04.036 --> 00:03:07.550
Make sure your bedroom is dark 
and comfortably cool

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.486
to minimize “threats” during hyperarousal.

00:03:10.486 --> 00:03:12.515
Only use your bed for sleeping,

00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:13.720
and if you’re restless,

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.855
leave the room and tire yourself out 
with relaxing activities

00:03:17.855 --> 00:03:18.773
like reading,

00:03:18.773 --> 00:03:19.608
meditating,

00:03:19.608 --> 00:03:20.894
or journaling.

00:03:20.894 --> 00:03:25.737
Regulate your metabolism by setting
consistent resting and waking times

00:03:25.737 --> 00:03:29.018
to help orient 
your body’s biological clock.

00:03:29.018 --> 00:03:31.572
This clock, or circadian rhythm,

00:03:31.572 --> 00:03:33.290
is also sensitive to light,

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.427
so avoid bright lights at night

00:03:35.427 --> 00:03:38.313
to help tell your body
that it’s time for sleep.

00:03:38.313 --> 00:03:39.997
In addition to these practices,

00:03:39.997 --> 00:03:42.755
some doctors prescribe medication 
to aid sleep,

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:46.621
but there aren’t reliable medications 
that help in all cases.

00:03:46.621 --> 00:03:49.838
And over-the-counter sleeping pills 
can be highly addictive,

00:03:49.838 --> 00:03:52.467
leading to withdrawal 
that worsens symptoms.

00:03:52.467 --> 00:03:54.440
But before seeking any treatment,

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.239
make sure your sleeplessness 
is actually due to insomnia.

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.328
Approximately 8% of patients diagnosed 
with chronic insomnia

00:04:02.328 --> 00:04:05.719
are actually suffering from a less common
genetic problem

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:10.485
called delayed sleep phase disorder,
or DSPD.

00:04:10.485 --> 00:04:15.453
People with DSPD have a circadian rhythm 
significantly longer than 24 hours,

00:04:15.453 --> 00:04:19.732
putting their sleeping habits out 
of sync with traditional sleeping hours.

00:04:19.732 --> 00:04:22.954
So while they have difficulty 
falling asleep at a typical bedtime,

00:04:22.954 --> 00:04:25.371
it’s not due to increased stress.

00:04:25.371 --> 00:04:26.823
And given the opportunity,

00:04:26.823 --> 00:04:30.475
they can sleep comfortably 
on their own delayed schedule.

00:04:30.475 --> 00:04:33.219
Our sleeping and waking cycle 
is a delicate balance,

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:37.518
and one that’s vital to maintain
for our physical and mental wellbeing.

00:04:37.518 --> 00:04:38.977
For all these reasons,

00:04:38.977 --> 00:04:41.368
it’s worth putting in some time 
and effort

00:04:41.368 --> 00:04:44.339
to sustain a stable bedtime routine,

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:47.241
but try not to lose any sleep over it.
