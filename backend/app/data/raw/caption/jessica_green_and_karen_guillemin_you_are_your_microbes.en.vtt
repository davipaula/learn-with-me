00:00:13.974 --> 00:00:16.411
Being human,

00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:21.076
we each view ourselves as a unique and independent individual,

00:00:21.076 --> 00:00:23.064
but we're never alone!

00:00:23.064 --> 00:00:26.956
Millions of microscopic beings inhabit our bodies,

00:00:26.956 --> 00:00:29.462
and no two bodies are the same.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:33.080
Each is a different habitat for microbial communities:

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.319
from the arid deserts of our skin,

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:38.106
to the villages on our lips,

00:00:38.106 --> 00:00:39.978
and the cities in our mouths.

00:00:39.978 --> 00:00:44.696
Even every tooth is its own distinctive neighborhood,

00:00:44.696 --> 00:00:50.326
and our guts are teaming metropolises of interacting microbes.

00:00:50.326 --> 00:00:52.866
And in these bustling streets of our guts,

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:56.306
we see a constant influx of food,

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:59.111
and every microbe has a job to do.

00:00:59.111 --> 00:01:01.947
Here's a cellulolytic bacteria, for example.

00:01:01.947 --> 00:01:04.837
Their one job is to break down cellulose,

00:01:04.837 --> 00:01:08.567
a common compound in vegetables, into sugars.

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:11.690
Those simple sugars then move along to the respirators,

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.955
another set of microbes that snatch up

00:01:13.955 --> 00:01:17.347
these simple sugars and burn them as fuel.

00:01:17.347 --> 00:01:19.813
As food travels through our digestive tract,

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:23.716
it reaches the fermentors who extract energy from these sugars

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.247
by converting them into chemicals,

00:01:25.247 --> 00:01:27.446
like alcohol and hydrogen gas,

00:01:27.446 --> 00:01:30.512
which they spew out as waste products.

00:01:30.512 --> 00:01:33.165
Deeper in the depths of our gut city,

00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:37.518
the syntrophs eke out a living off the fermenters' trash.

00:01:37.518 --> 00:01:39.589
At each step of this process,

00:01:39.589 --> 00:01:41.251
energy is released,

00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:42.776
and that energy is absorbed

00:01:42.776 --> 00:01:44.492
by the cells of the digestive tract.

00:01:44.492 --> 00:01:48.169
This city we just saw is different in everyone.

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:52.130
Every person has a unique and diverse community of gut microbes

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.032
that can process food in different ways.

00:01:55.032 --> 00:01:57.642
One person's gut microbes may be capable

00:01:57.642 --> 00:01:59.907
of releasing only a fraction of the calories

00:01:59.907 --> 00:02:03.113
that another person's gut microbes can extract.

00:02:03.113 --> 00:02:07.663
So, what determines the membership of our gut microbial community?

00:02:07.663 --> 00:02:10.661
Well, things like our genetic makeup

00:02:10.661 --> 00:02:13.073
and the microbes we encounter throughout our lives

00:02:13.073 --> 00:02:16.829
can contribute to our microbial ecosystems.

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.073
The food we eat also influences

00:02:19.073 --> 00:02:21.275
which microbes live in our gut.

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:24.354
For example, food made of complex molecules,

00:02:24.354 --> 00:02:25.213
like an apple,

00:02:25.213 --> 00:02:28.751
requires a lot of different microbial workers to break it down.

00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:30.858
But, if a food is made of simple molecules,

00:02:30.858 --> 00:02:31.951
like a lollipop,

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:34.989
some of these workers are put out of a job.

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.005
Those workers leave the city, never to return.

00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:40.623
What doesn't function well are gut microbial communities

00:02:40.623 --> 00:02:43.718
with only a few different types of workers.

00:02:43.718 --> 00:02:46.406
For example, humans who suffer from diseases

00:02:46.406 --> 00:02:49.016
like diabetes or chronic gut inflamation

00:02:49.016 --> 00:02:52.550
typically have less microbial variety in their guts.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.886
We don't fully understand the best way

00:02:54.886 --> 00:02:58.100
to manage our individual microbial societies,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.269
but it is likely that lifestyle changes,

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.704
such as eating a varied diet of complex, plant-based foods,

00:03:04.704 --> 00:03:07.874
can help revitalize our microbial ecosystems in our gut

00:03:07.874 --> 00:03:10.813
and across the entire landscape of our body.

00:03:10.813 --> 00:03:13.291
So, we are really not alone in our body.

00:03:13.291 --> 00:03:17.126
Our bodies are homes to millions of different microbes,

00:03:17.126 --> 00:03:20.957
and we need them just as much as they need us.

00:03:20.957 --> 00:03:23.048
As we learn more about how our microbes

00:03:23.048 --> 00:03:25.319
interact with each other and with our bodies,

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.546
we will reveal how we can nurture

00:03:27.546 --> 00:03:29.294
this complex, invisible world

00:03:29.294 --> 00:03:31.176
that shapes our personal identity,

00:03:31.176 --> 00:03:32.184
our health,

00:03:32.184 --> 00:03:33.945
and our well-being.
