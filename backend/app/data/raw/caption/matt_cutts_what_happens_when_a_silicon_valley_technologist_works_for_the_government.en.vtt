00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:14.059
Hi everybody.

00:00:14.083 --> 00:00:15.351
My name is Matt Cutts,

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:19.809
and I worked at Google
for almost 17 years.

00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:21.726
As a distinguished engineer there,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.893
I was pretty close to the top
of the Silicon Valley ecosystem.

00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:28.934
Then I decided to follow
some inspiring folks

00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:33.018
and do a short tour
at the US Digital Service.

00:00:33.042 --> 00:00:36.226
That's the group of geeks
that helped rescue HealthCare.gov

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.018
when that website went down hard in 2013.

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:41.309
Yeah.

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.934
So I signed up for
a three-to-six-month tour,

00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.393
and almost three years later,

00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:48.476
I'm still in Washington DC,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.226
working for the federal government,

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.143
because the government
really needs technologists right now.

00:00:54.167 --> 00:00:55.434
At my old job,

00:00:55.458 --> 00:00:58.059
every room had videoconferencing

00:00:58.083 --> 00:01:00.268
integrated with calendars,

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:04.393
power cables were built
right into the furniture.

00:01:04.417 --> 00:01:06.976
When I moved to a government agency,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.934
I had to call a person
to set up a phone conference.

00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:11.684
And when we moved to a new office,

00:01:11.708 --> 00:01:13.559
we didn't have furniture for a while,

00:01:13.583 --> 00:01:16.250
so we set up the phone on a trash can.

00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:20.893
One of the things that surprised me,
whenever I moved to DC,

00:01:20.917 --> 00:01:24.667
is how much the government
still has to deal with paper.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.518
This is a facility in Winston-Salem,

00:01:27.542 --> 00:01:28.934
North Carolina,

00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:30.518
where people were worried

00:01:30.542 --> 00:01:33.976
that the building
might be structurally unsound

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.268
from the weight of all that paper.

00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:37.559
Yeah.

00:01:37.583 --> 00:01:38.851
Paper has some downsides.

00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:40.143
Here's a pop quiz:

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:44.101
If your last name starts with H or higher,

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:47.125
H or higher, would you raise your hand?

00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:49.934
Wow.

00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.226
I have some bad news:

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.434
Your veteran records
might have been destroyed

00:01:53.458 --> 00:01:54.768
in a fire in 1973.

00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:55.809
(Laughter)

00:01:55.833 --> 00:01:57.101
Yeah.

00:01:57.125 --> 00:02:01.934
Paper processes are also slower
and more prone to errors.

00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:03.226
If you're a veteran

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.351
and you're applying
for your health benefits

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:06.643
using a paper form,

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:10.851
you might have to wait months
for that form to be processed.

00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:13.268
We replaced that with a web form,

00:02:13.292 --> 00:02:15.018
and now most veterans find out

00:02:15.042 --> 00:02:17.393
if they can get access
to their health benefits

00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:18.934
in 10 minutes.

00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.726
(Applause)

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.684
Here's another launch that I'm proud of.

00:02:23.708 --> 00:02:25.976
We worked with the Small
Business Administration

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.226
to move one of their systems
from paper to digital.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.226
So this is a picture from before,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.726
and this is afterwards.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.184
Same cubicles, same people,

00:02:36.208 --> 00:02:38.500
just a better system for everyone.

00:02:39.417 --> 00:02:42.643
At one point, we wanted to celebrate
modernizing a different system,

00:02:42.667 --> 00:02:44.559
and so we went to a local grocery store

00:02:44.583 --> 00:02:46.226
and we said, "Can you make a cake

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.184
and decorate it with the form
that we've digitized?"

00:02:49.208 --> 00:02:52.768
And the grocery store
got really weirded out by that request.

00:02:52.792 --> 00:02:55.893
They wanted a letter
on official government letterhead.

00:02:55.917 --> 00:02:59.059
Well, we work for the government,
so we wrote a letter that said,

00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:01.476
"You can use this public-domain form

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.601
on a cake for celebratory purposes."

00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:06.643
(Laughter)

00:03:06.667 --> 00:03:09.601
Which led to bad jokes
about filling forms out in triplicake.

00:03:09.625 --> 00:03:11.476
Yes, dad jokes in government.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.309
Now I've talked a lot about paper,

00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:17.976
but we also bring up
computer systems that go down.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.351
We bring in modern technology practices,

00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:23.601
like user-centered design and the cloud,

00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:26.476
and we also help improve procurement.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.351
It turns out government buys software

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:34.143
the same way that it buys chairs
and brownies and tanks:

00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:39.268
from government regulations
that are over 1,000 pages long.

00:03:39.292 --> 00:03:42.976
So yes, there's some stuff
that's messed up in government right now.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.143
But if you think Silicon Valley
is the savior in this story,

00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:47.434
(Laughs)

00:03:47.458 --> 00:03:49.226
you've got another thing coming.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.101
Some of the best and brightest
minds in technology

00:03:52.125 --> 00:03:54.101
are working on meal-delivery start-ups

00:03:54.125 --> 00:03:55.393
and scooters

00:03:55.417 --> 00:03:59.309
and how to deliver weed to people better.

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:02.875
Is that really the most important thing
to work on right now?

00:04:03.792 --> 00:04:07.893
Silicon Valley likes to talk
about making the world a better place.

00:04:07.917 --> 00:04:11.684
But you feel your impact
in a much more visceral way

00:04:11.708 --> 00:04:12.958
in government.

00:04:14.042 --> 00:04:16.809
This is somebody whose dad passed away.

00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:18.851
He hunted me down on Twitter

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:21.893
to say that a system that we had improved

00:04:21.917 --> 00:04:24.375
worked well for him during a tough time.

00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:28.434
Those tough times are
when government needs to work well

00:04:28.458 --> 00:04:31.309
and why we need innovation in government.

00:04:31.333 --> 00:04:32.857
Now I have a confession to make.

00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:34.226
When I came to DC,

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.101
I sometimes used words like bureaucrat.

00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:39.393
These days,

00:04:39.417 --> 00:04:42.601
I'm much more likely
to use words like civil servant.

00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:45.518
Like Francine, who can make you cry.

00:04:45.542 --> 00:04:47.434
Or at least, she made me cry,

00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:50.101
because she's so inspiring.

00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:54.101
I am also deeply, fiercely proud
of my colleagues.

00:04:54.125 --> 00:04:57.518
They will work
through illogical situations

00:04:57.542 --> 00:05:00.875
and put in late nights
to get to the right result.

00:05:01.833 --> 00:05:04.434
The government can't pay
huge salary bonuses,

00:05:04.458 --> 00:05:07.726
so we ended up making our own awards.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.726
Our mascot is a crab named Molly.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.643
And so that award is actually
a crab-shaped purse,

00:05:14.667 --> 00:05:16.333
screwed into sheet metal.

00:05:18.208 --> 00:05:21.059
These days, I believe less
in silver bullets

00:05:21.083 --> 00:05:23.417
that are going to fix everything.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.059
I believe more

00:05:26.083 --> 00:05:28.125
in the people who show up to help.

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:32.018
If you're looking for something
deeply meaningful --

00:05:32.042 --> 00:05:36.851
and full disclosure,
sometimes incredibly frustrating --

00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:38.893
here's what you need to know.

00:05:38.917 --> 00:05:40.809
There is something difficult

00:05:40.833 --> 00:05:45.976
and messy and vital and magical happening

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.893
when civil servants partner
with technologists

00:05:48.917 --> 00:05:52.393
at the city and state and national level.

00:05:52.417 --> 00:05:54.434
You don't have to do it forever.

00:05:54.458 --> 00:05:57.768
But you can make a difference
in public service

00:05:57.792 --> 00:05:59.393
right now.

00:05:59.417 --> 00:06:00.684
Thank you.

00:06:00.708 --> 00:06:03.750
(Applause)
