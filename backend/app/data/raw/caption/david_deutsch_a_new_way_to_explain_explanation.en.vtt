00:00:18.917 --> 00:00:20.460
I'm sure that,

00:00:20.484 --> 00:00:25.836
throughout the 100,000-odd years
of our species' existence

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.210
and even before,

00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:33.939
our ancestors looked up at the night sky
and wondered what stars are --

00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:36.253
wondering, therefore,

00:00:37.253 --> 00:00:40.917
how to explain what they saw

00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:44.382
in terms of things unseen.

00:00:47.184 --> 00:00:52.430
OK, so, most people only wondered
that occasionally, like today,

00:00:52.454 --> 00:00:56.930
in breaks from whatever
normally preoccupied them.

00:00:56.954 --> 00:01:03.816
But what normally preoccupied them
also involved yearning to know.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.980
They wished they knew

00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:10.673
how to prevent their food supply
from sometimes failing,

00:01:10.697 --> 00:01:13.517
and how they could rest
when they were tired

00:01:13.541 --> 00:01:15.935
without risking starvation,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.523
be warmer, cooler, safer,

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:23.203
in less pain.

00:01:23.227 --> 00:01:28.482
I bet those prehistoric cave artists
would have loved to know

00:01:28.506 --> 00:01:29.941
how to draw better.

00:01:31.015 --> 00:01:32.271
(Laughter)

00:01:32.295 --> 00:01:34.375
In every aspect of their lives,

00:01:35.486 --> 00:01:40.445
they wished for progress, just as we do.

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:46.177
But they failed, almost
completely, to make any.

00:01:46.812 --> 00:01:49.487
They didn't know how to.

00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:55.266
Discoveries like fire happened so rarely

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.632
that, from an individual's point of view,

00:01:57.656 --> 00:02:00.471
the world never improved.

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:03.237
Nothing new was learned.

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.937
The first clue to the origin of starlight

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:12.415
happened as recently as 1899:

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.688
radioactivity.

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:16.490
And within 40 years,

00:02:16.514 --> 00:02:20.306
physicists discovered
the whole explanation,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.355
expressed, as usual, in elegant symbols.

00:02:25.212 --> 00:02:27.645
But never mind the symbols.

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:33.006
Think how many discoveries they represent.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.341
Nuclei and nuclear reactions, of course.

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:38.347
But isotopes,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.403
particles of electricity,

00:02:43.554 --> 00:02:45.096
antimatter,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.071
neutrinos,

00:02:49.095 --> 00:02:53.490
the conversion of mass
to energy -- that's E=mc2 --

00:02:53.514 --> 00:02:54.750
gamma rays,

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.672
transmutation.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.306
That ancient dream that had
always eluded the alchemists

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.584
was achieved through these same theories

00:03:06.608 --> 00:03:11.306
that explained starlight
and other ancient mysteries

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.678
and new, unexpected phenomena.

00:03:14.702 --> 00:03:18.675
That all that, discovered in 40 years,

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.907
had not been in the previous
hundred thousand

00:03:21.931 --> 00:03:25.238
was not for lack of thinking

00:03:25.262 --> 00:03:29.379
about stars and all those other
urgent problems they had.

00:03:30.093 --> 00:03:34.387
They even arrived at answers,
such as myths,

00:03:34.411 --> 00:03:36.563
that dominated their lives,

00:03:36.587 --> 00:03:41.363
yet bore almost
no resemblance to the truth.

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:46.329
The tragedy of that protracted stagnation

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.795
isn't sufficiently recognized, I think.

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.056
These were people with brains
of essentially the same design

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.306
that eventually did discover
all those things.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.077
But that ability to make progress

00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:06.306
remained almost unused,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.053
until the event that revolutionized
the human condition

00:04:12.077 --> 00:04:13.703
and changed the universe.

00:04:13.727 --> 00:04:15.060
Or so we should hope,

00:04:15.084 --> 00:04:19.306
because that event
was the scientific revolution,

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.195
ever since which our knowledge
of the physical world

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:27.074
and of how to adapt it to our wishes

00:04:27.098 --> 00:04:29.074
has been growing relentlessly.

00:04:29.584 --> 00:04:32.184
Now, what had changed?

00:04:32.208 --> 00:04:34.473
What were people now doing
for the first time

00:04:34.497 --> 00:04:38.507
that made that difference
between stagnation

00:04:38.531 --> 00:04:41.536
and rapid, open-ended discovery?

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.648
How to make that difference

00:04:44.672 --> 00:04:48.129
is surely the most important
universal truth

00:04:48.153 --> 00:04:49.797
that it's possible to know.

00:04:50.781 --> 00:04:55.173
And worryingly, there's no consensus
about what it is.

00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:57.005
So, I'll tell you.

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:58.060
(Laughter)

00:04:58.084 --> 00:05:00.575
But I'll have to backtrack a little first.

00:05:01.376 --> 00:05:03.399
Before the scientific revolution,

00:05:04.447 --> 00:05:07.459
they believed that everything
important, knowable,

00:05:07.483 --> 00:05:08.977
was already known,

00:05:09.001 --> 00:05:12.684
enshrined in ancient
writings, institutions

00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:15.744
and in some genuinely
useful rules of thumb --

00:05:15.768 --> 00:05:19.010
which were, however, entrenched as dogmas,

00:05:19.034 --> 00:05:21.921
along with many falsehoods.

00:05:21.945 --> 00:05:25.673
So, they believed that knowledge
came from authorities

00:05:25.697 --> 00:05:28.154
that actually knew very little.

00:05:28.178 --> 00:05:30.126
And therefore,

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.784
progress depended
on learning how to reject

00:05:34.808 --> 00:05:41.568
the authority of learned men,
the priests, traditions and rulers,

00:05:41.592 --> 00:05:46.306
which is why the scientific revolution
had to have a wider context:

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:53.306
the Enlightenment, a revolution
in how people sought knowledge,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.858
trying not to rely on authority.

00:05:56.882 --> 00:05:58.597
"Take no one's word for it."

00:05:58.621 --> 00:06:01.984
But that can't be
what made the difference.

00:06:02.008 --> 00:06:04.961
Authorities had been rejected
before, many times.

00:06:04.985 --> 00:06:07.009
And that rarely, if ever,

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:10.306
caused anything
like the scientific revolution.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.340
At the time, what they thought
distinguished science

00:06:14.364 --> 00:06:18.796
was a radical idea about things unseen,

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.433
known as empiricism --

00:06:21.457 --> 00:06:24.794
all knowledge derives from the senses.

00:06:26.484 --> 00:06:29.691
Well, we've seen that that can't be true.

00:06:29.715 --> 00:06:35.415
It did help by promoting
observation and experiment.

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:36.698
But, from the outset,

00:06:36.722 --> 00:06:40.421
it was obvious that there was something
horribly wrong with it.

00:06:40.445 --> 00:06:42.400
Knowledge comes from the senses?

00:06:42.424 --> 00:06:43.582
In what language?

00:06:43.606 --> 00:06:48.152
Certainly not the language of mathematics,
in which, Galileo rightly said,

00:06:48.176 --> 00:06:50.144
the book of nature is written.

00:06:51.553 --> 00:06:52.710
Look at the world.

00:06:52.734 --> 00:06:56.527
You don't see equations
carved on the mountainsides.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.050
If you did, it would be because
people had carved them.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.062
By the way, why don't we do that?

00:07:03.086 --> 00:07:04.162
(Laughter)

00:07:04.186 --> 00:07:05.695
What's wrong with us?

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:07.163
(Laughter)

00:07:07.187 --> 00:07:09.826
Empiricism is inadequate

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:16.113
because, well, scientific theories
explain the seen in terms of the unseen.

00:07:16.137 --> 00:07:18.722
And the unseen, you have to admit,

00:07:18.746 --> 00:07:20.668
doesn't come to us through the senses.

00:07:20.692 --> 00:07:24.435
We don't see those nuclear
reactions in stars.

00:07:24.459 --> 00:07:27.901
We don't see the origin of species.

00:07:27.925 --> 00:07:31.306
We don't see the curvature of space-time,

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.249
and other universes.

00:07:33.273 --> 00:07:35.441
But we know about those things.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.208
How?

00:07:38.131 --> 00:07:43.947
Well, the classic empiricist
answer is induction --

00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:47.306
the unseen resembles the seen.

00:07:47.763 --> 00:07:49.390
But it doesn't.

00:07:49.414 --> 00:07:54.402
You know what the clinching evidence was
that space-time is curved?

00:07:54.426 --> 00:07:57.582
It was a photograph -- not of space-time,

00:07:57.606 --> 00:08:01.743
but of an eclipse, with a dot
there rather than there.

00:08:01.767 --> 00:08:03.598
And the evidence for evolution?

00:08:03.622 --> 00:08:06.039
Some rocks and some finches.

00:08:06.912 --> 00:08:08.090
And parallel universes?

00:08:08.114 --> 00:08:11.770
Again: dots there
rather than there, on a screen.

00:08:11.794 --> 00:08:14.404
What we see in all these cases

00:08:14.428 --> 00:08:21.002
bears no resemblance to the reality
that we conclude is responsible --

00:08:21.026 --> 00:08:27.030
only a long chain of theoretical reasoning
and interpretation connects them.

00:08:27.054 --> 00:08:29.363
"Ah!" say creationists.

00:08:29.387 --> 00:08:31.787
"So you admit it's all interpretation.

00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:34.270
No one's ever seen evolution.

00:08:34.294 --> 00:08:36.800
We see rocks.

00:08:36.824 --> 00:08:39.253
You have your interpretation.
We have ours.

00:08:39.277 --> 00:08:42.924
Yours comes from guesswork;
ours, from the Bible."

00:08:43.432 --> 00:08:49.643
But what creationist
and empiricists both ignore

00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:51.105
is that, in that sense,

00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:53.853
no one's ever seen a Bible either,

00:08:54.964 --> 00:08:58.549
that the eye only detects light,
which we don't perceive.

00:08:58.573 --> 00:09:01.230
Brains only detect nerve impulses.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.871
And they don't perceive even those
as what they really are,

00:09:04.895 --> 00:09:07.095
namely electrical crackles.

00:09:07.119 --> 00:09:11.862
So we perceive nothing
as what it really is.

00:09:11.886 --> 00:09:16.418
Our connection to reality
is never just perception.

00:09:16.823 --> 00:09:20.473
It's always, as Karl Popper put it,

00:09:20.497 --> 00:09:21.973
theory-laden.

00:09:23.076 --> 00:09:25.968
Scientific knowledge
isn't derived from anything.

00:09:25.992 --> 00:09:30.081
Like all knowledge,
it's conjectural, guesswork,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:33.570
tested by observation,

00:09:33.594 --> 00:09:35.665
not derived from it.

00:09:37.423 --> 00:09:40.449
So, were testable conjectures
the great innovation

00:09:40.473 --> 00:09:44.306
that opened the intellectual prison gates?

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:49.416
No, contrary to what's usually said,
testability is common

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.783
in myths and all sorts of other
irrational modes of thinking.

00:09:53.807 --> 00:09:57.451
Any crank claiming the sun
will go out next Tuesday

00:09:57.475 --> 00:10:00.022
has got a testable prediction.

00:10:00.784 --> 00:10:05.376
Consider the ancient Greek myth
explaining seasons.

00:10:06.685 --> 00:10:08.991
Hades, god of the underworld,

00:10:09.015 --> 00:10:11.379
kidnaps Persephone, the goddess of spring,

00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:17.262
and negotiates a forced marriage contract,
requiring her to return regularly,

00:10:17.286 --> 00:10:18.657
and lets her go.

00:10:18.681 --> 00:10:20.306
And each year,

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.259
she is magically compelled to return.

00:10:23.283 --> 00:10:25.306
And her mother, Demeter,

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.306
goddess of the earth,

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.116
is sad, and makes it cold and barren.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.255
That myth is testable.

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:39.270
If winter is caused by Demeter's sadness,

00:10:39.294 --> 00:10:43.306
then it must happen everywhere
on earth simultaneously.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:45.407
So if the ancient Greeks had only known

00:10:45.431 --> 00:10:49.811
that Australia is at its warmest
when Demeter is at her saddest ...

00:10:49.835 --> 00:10:50.850
(Laughter)

00:10:50.874 --> 00:10:53.051
they'd have known
that their theory is false.

00:10:53.075 --> 00:10:54.107
(Laughter)

00:10:54.131 --> 00:10:56.751
So, what was wrong with that myth

00:10:56.775 --> 00:10:59.500
and with all prescientific thinking?

00:10:59.524 --> 00:11:03.580
And what, then, made
that momentous difference?

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:09.018
I think there's one thing
you have to care about

00:11:09.042 --> 00:11:13.105
and that implies testability,
the scientific method,

00:11:13.129 --> 00:11:15.016
the Enlightenment and everything.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.183
And here's the crucial thing:

00:11:17.207 --> 00:11:20.120
there is such a thing
as a defect in a story.

00:11:20.144 --> 00:11:21.928
I don't just mean a logical defect.

00:11:21.952 --> 00:11:25.183
I mean a bad explanation.

00:11:25.207 --> 00:11:26.609
What does that mean?

00:11:26.633 --> 00:11:31.507
Well, an explanation is an assertion
about what's there, unseen,

00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:34.306
that accounts for what's seen;

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:39.800
because the explanatory role
of Persephone's marriage contract

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:41.203
could be played equally well

00:11:41.227 --> 00:11:45.280
by infinitely many other ad hoc entities.

00:11:45.304 --> 00:11:48.875
Why a marriage contract
and not any other reason

00:11:48.899 --> 00:11:52.090
for regular annual action?

00:11:52.114 --> 00:11:55.306
Here's one: Persephone wasn't released.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:12:01.631
She escaped, and returns every spring
to take revenge on Hades,

00:12:01.655 --> 00:12:03.306
with her spring powers.

00:12:03.799 --> 00:12:08.157
She cools his domain with spring air,

00:12:08.181 --> 00:12:12.306
venting heat up to the surface,
creating summer.

00:12:12.718 --> 00:12:16.803
That accounts for the same
phenomena as the original myth.

00:12:16.827 --> 00:12:18.584
It's equally testable.

00:12:19.282 --> 00:12:24.736
Yet what it asserts about reality
is, in many ways, the opposite.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.223
And that's possible

00:12:26.247 --> 00:12:31.243
because the details of the original myth
are unrelated to seasons,

00:12:31.267 --> 00:12:34.006
except via the myth itself.

00:12:35.083 --> 00:12:38.202
This easy variability

00:12:38.226 --> 00:12:41.543
is the sign of a bad explanation,

00:12:42.194 --> 00:12:45.869
because, without a functional reason

00:12:45.893 --> 00:12:50.314
to prefer one of countless variants,

00:12:51.372 --> 00:12:53.807
advocating one of them
in preference to the others

00:12:53.831 --> 00:12:55.405
is irrational.

00:12:55.429 --> 00:13:00.570
So, for the essence of what makes
the difference to enable progress,

00:13:00.594 --> 00:13:02.929
seek good explanations,

00:13:02.953 --> 00:13:05.402
the ones that can't be easily varied,

00:13:05.426 --> 00:13:08.505
while still explaining the phenomena.

00:13:10.076 --> 00:13:12.582
Now our current explanation of seasons

00:13:13.693 --> 00:13:17.033
is that the Earth's axis
is tilted like that,

00:13:17.057 --> 00:13:20.691
so each hemisphere tilts
towards the sun for half the year,

00:13:20.715 --> 00:13:22.639
and away for the other half.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.214
[Not to scale!]

00:13:24.238 --> 00:13:25.404
Better put that up.

00:13:25.428 --> 00:13:26.714
(Laughter)

00:13:26.738 --> 00:13:29.978
That's a good explanation:

00:13:30.002 --> 00:13:31.424
hard to vary,

00:13:31.448 --> 00:13:34.538
because every detail
plays a functional role.

00:13:34.562 --> 00:13:37.414
For instance, we know,
independently of seasons,

00:13:37.438 --> 00:13:42.490
that surfaces tilted away
from radiant heat are heated less,

00:13:42.514 --> 00:13:45.480
and that a spinning sphere, in space,

00:13:45.504 --> 00:13:47.799
points in a constant direction.

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:51.632
And the tilt also explains

00:13:51.656 --> 00:13:55.085
the sun's angle of elevation
at different times of year,

00:13:55.109 --> 00:14:00.125
and predicts that the seasons will be
out of phase in the two hemispheres.

00:14:00.149 --> 00:14:02.465
If they'd been observed in phase,

00:14:02.489 --> 00:14:04.475
the theory would have been refuted.

00:14:04.499 --> 00:14:10.728
But now, the fact that it's also
a good explanation, hard to vary,

00:14:10.752 --> 00:14:12.962
makes the crucial difference.

00:14:14.067 --> 00:14:19.463
If the ancient Greeks had found out
about seasons in Australia,

00:14:19.487 --> 00:14:23.387
they could have easily
varied their myth to predict that.

00:14:23.411 --> 00:14:25.572
For instance, when Demeter's upset,

00:14:25.596 --> 00:14:30.040
she banishes heat from her vicinity
into the other hemisphere,

00:14:30.064 --> 00:14:31.447
where it makes summer.

00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:34.306
So, being proved wrong by observation

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.873
and changing their theory accordingly

00:14:36.897 --> 00:14:42.091
still wouldn't have got the ancient Greeks
one jot closer to understanding seasons,

00:14:42.115 --> 00:14:45.881
because their explanation
was bad -- easy to vary.

00:14:45.905 --> 00:14:48.719
And it's only when an explanation is good

00:14:48.743 --> 00:14:51.236
that it even matters
whether it's testable.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.491
If the axis-tilt theory had been refuted,

00:14:53.515 --> 00:14:55.871
its defenders would have had
nowhere to go.

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:58.621
No easily implemented change

00:14:58.645 --> 00:15:03.753
could make that tilt cause
the same seasons in both hemispheres.

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:11.491
The search for hard-to-vary explanations
is the origin of all progress.

00:15:11.515 --> 00:15:16.028
It's the basic regulating principle
of the Enlightenment.

00:15:16.052 --> 00:15:20.418
So, in science, two false
approaches blight progress.

00:15:20.442 --> 00:15:23.306
One's well-known: untestable theories.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:27.232
But the more important one
is explanationless theories.

00:15:27.256 --> 00:15:31.812
Whenever you're told that some existing
statistical trend will continue

00:15:31.836 --> 00:15:37.076
but you aren't given a hard-to-vary
account of what causes that trend,

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.217
you're being told a wizard did it.

00:15:39.241 --> 00:15:42.061
When you are told
that carrots have human rights

00:15:42.085 --> 00:15:44.183
because they share half our genes,

00:15:44.207 --> 00:15:49.524
but not how gene percentages
confer rights -- wizard.

00:15:50.023 --> 00:15:54.358
When someone announces
that the nature-nurture debate

00:15:54.382 --> 00:15:55.595
has been settled

00:15:55.619 --> 00:16:00.104
because there's evidence that a given
percentage of our political opinions

00:16:00.128 --> 00:16:02.306
are genetically inherited,

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.306
but they don't explain
how genes cause opinions,

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:07.500
they've settled nothing.

00:16:07.524 --> 00:16:11.015
They're saying that our opinions
are caused by wizards,

00:16:11.039 --> 00:16:12.763
and presumably, so are their own.

00:16:12.787 --> 00:16:13.937
(Laughter)

00:16:13.961 --> 00:16:20.862
That the truth consists
of hard-to-vary assertions about reality

00:16:20.886 --> 00:16:24.726
is the most important fact
about the physical world.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:28.970
It's a fact that is itself unseen,

00:16:28.994 --> 00:16:31.688
yet impossible to vary.

00:16:31.712 --> 00:16:32.901
Thank you.

00:16:32.925 --> 00:16:36.330
(Applause)
