00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.091
So often,

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.068
I'll take a fitness class,

00:00:17.092 --> 00:00:19.924
or I'll go to a music venue,

00:00:19.948 --> 00:00:23.283
or, really, anywhere that plays
music in the background,

00:00:23.307 --> 00:00:26.336
and I'll find myself loving the rhythms

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.753
and the melodies and the beats ...

00:00:29.357 --> 00:00:31.956
And then I take a second
to listen to the lyrics,

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.596
lyrics that, for example,
place us in a position of subservience

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.852
that we would never tolerate
in any other context.

00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:43.153
And I'm aghast at the degree to which
we normalize sexism in our culture.

00:00:43.177 --> 00:00:45.596
I listen to this music and I'm like,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.747
I don't want to have to turn up
to the sound of my own oppression.

00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:54.694
You know, music is one of the most
powerful forms of communication,

00:00:54.718 --> 00:00:58.750
because it has the potential
to either uplift or oppress.

00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:03.025
Music caters to the emotions.
Music caters to the soul.

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:04.765
Music opens up our soul.

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:07.145
It opens up our channels
to receive information

00:01:07.169 --> 00:01:09.005
about somebody else's walk of life,

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:11.170
to inform our own roles.

00:01:11.194 --> 00:01:15.355
And while I have no problem
with male fantasy,

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:17.506
what I do have a problem with

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.290
is that, according to a recent study,
only 2.6 percent of all music producers

00:01:23.314 --> 00:01:24.786
identify as women.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.003
That means an even smaller percentage
identify as trans or gender nonconforming.

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:31.497
And why does this matter?

00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:34.930
Because, if we don't own
and control our own narrative,

00:01:34.954 --> 00:01:38.121
somebody else will
tell our stories for us,

00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:39.958
and they will get it wrong,

00:01:39.982 --> 00:01:43.133
perpetuating the very myths
that hold us back.

00:01:43.565 --> 00:01:47.174
And I'm not here to tell other people
how to make their music.

00:01:48.063 --> 00:01:51.702
But I am here to provide
and design the alternative.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.430
One strategy I take in my music

00:01:55.454 --> 00:02:00.474
is making uplifting, energetic,
percussive global beats

00:02:00.498 --> 00:02:02.237
and placing lyrics on top of them

00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:05.813
that genuinely describe
my life's experiences

00:02:05.837 --> 00:02:08.700
without contributing
to the oppression of anybody else.

00:02:09.152 --> 00:02:11.410
It's funny, because it's the same reason

00:02:11.434 --> 00:02:15.209
as to why we excuse
so many problematic lyrics;

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:17.994
it's because we love
how the beats make us feel.

00:02:19.144 --> 00:02:23.202
An example of this is my song
"Top Knot Turn Up."

00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:28.456
(Music: "Top Knot Turn Up")

00:02:43.075 --> 00:02:47.010
(Sings) I turned off my phone's
notifications so I have more time /

00:02:47.034 --> 00:02:50.638
No bubbles to trouble
my clear state of mind /

00:02:50.662 --> 00:02:52.760
One thing to know, 
I'm not here to please /

00:02:52.784 --> 00:02:54.688
Hair tied up, I do it properly /

00:02:54.712 --> 00:02:56.229
My time is not your property /

00:02:56.253 --> 00:02:58.524
When I'm productive like my ovaries, 
eyy! /

00:02:58.548 --> 00:03:01.951
Give a grown girl room to breathe,
basic rights and her liberty /

00:03:01.975 --> 00:03:05.537
Free from insecurity
that the world's projecting onto me /

00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:07.607
Please do not trouble me
when I am focused /

00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:09.668
The future is female
you already know this /

00:03:09.682 --> 00:03:11.881
I'm fighting against
the corruption on SCOTUS /

00:03:11.905 --> 00:03:14.744
Turned up in my top knot
since when I first wrote this /

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:19.273
It's a top knot turn up
It's a top knot turn up, turn up, turn up.

00:03:19.297 --> 00:03:23.094
It's a top knot turn up
It's a top knot turn up, turn up, turn up.

00:03:23.118 --> 00:03:26.597
It's a top knot turn up
It's a top knot turn up, eyyy.

00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:28.321
It's a top knot turn up.

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:30.049
(Music ends)

00:03:30.178 --> 00:03:34.438
I want us to keep making
sex-positive, beautiful music

00:03:34.462 --> 00:03:36.625
about joy and freedom.

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:38.481
I want us to embrace our own pleasure

00:03:38.505 --> 00:03:40.577
just as much as we embrace our own pain.

00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:42.995
I want us to celebrate the authentic,

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.368
nuanced,

00:03:44.392 --> 00:03:47.757
multidimensional aspects
of our human existence,

00:03:48.575 --> 00:03:53.694
rather than perform false narratives
of degrading sexuality

00:03:53.718 --> 00:03:56.269
in order to feel accepted or loved.

00:03:56.293 --> 00:03:59.186
And another strategy
that I take in my music

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.126
to combat the misogyny
that exists on the airwaves

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.890
is to visually depict the very world
I wished we lived in.

00:04:05.914 --> 00:04:08.474
In the music video
for my song "See Me Thru,"

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:12.755
which is like a vibe-y,
queer electronic R and B song,

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:16.836
I cast two of my dear friends,
Ania and Dejha,

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.534
to play the role of the lovers,
because they're married in real life.

00:04:20.558 --> 00:04:23.910
But what you don't know
is that they also are behind the camera

00:04:23.934 --> 00:04:27.070
concepting and directing
the entire video.

00:04:28.206 --> 00:04:36.137
(Video) Heyyyyy ohhhh
My emotions were tired

00:04:38.682 --> 00:04:42.154
Music should be safe 
and accessible for all to experience.

00:04:42.192 --> 00:04:45.049
As you can see, it's not about
losing the sex appeal or swag

00:04:45.073 --> 00:04:46.278
that music has,

00:04:46.302 --> 00:04:50.049
it's about writing messages
that infuse tenderness and positivity

00:04:50.073 --> 00:04:53.023
into music that motivates us
and challenges us.

00:04:53.706 --> 00:04:57.178
And while we as musicians
absolutely have the responsibility

00:04:57.202 --> 00:04:59.968
to make music that isn't disempowering,

00:04:59.992 --> 00:05:02.408
the consumers can be
part of the change, too.

00:05:02.432 --> 00:05:04.992
Firstly, we get to choose
which songs we want to mute

00:05:05.016 --> 00:05:06.912
and which songs we want to turn louder.

00:05:06.936 --> 00:05:10.839
We get to say, "I respect myself enough
to say I don't want to listen to this,

00:05:10.863 --> 00:05:13.735
and I don't want this to be
in anybody else's space, either."

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.038
Secondly, we can simply ask ourselves:

00:05:16.062 --> 00:05:18.090
"Does this music or this message

00:05:18.114 --> 00:05:20.312
contribute to the oppression
of somebody else?

00:05:20.336 --> 00:05:21.517
Why am I tolerating it?"

00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:25.696
And finally, we can all be choosing
to make playlists or DJ-ing music

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.274
that provides the right vibe or mood
that we're looking for in that moment

00:05:29.298 --> 00:05:31.216
without the problematic messaging.

00:05:31.683 --> 00:05:32.896
Why does this matter?

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.354
Because it's teaching algorithms
in our streaming systems and our world

00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:39.420
exactly what it is that
we do want to listen to,

00:05:40.444 --> 00:05:43.335
creating long-term change
and a feedbacking mechanism

00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:45.077
that impacts the entire industry.

00:05:45.966 --> 00:05:47.615
This is not a message

00:05:48.482 --> 00:05:50.499
for just a small group of people.

00:05:50.523 --> 00:05:53.222
This is a message that affects everybody,

00:05:53.246 --> 00:05:57.236
because when we protect and liberate
our most vulnerable genders,

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.976
we liberate everybody.
