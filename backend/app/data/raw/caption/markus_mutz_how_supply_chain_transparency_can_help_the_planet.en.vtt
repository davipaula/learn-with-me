00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:15.101
In almost all aspects of our lives

00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:19.333
we have perfect information
available instantaneously.

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:23.309
My phone can tell me
everything about my finances,

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.559
where precisely I am on a map

00:00:25.583 --> 00:00:27.726
and the best way to my next destination,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.309
all with a click of a button.

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.434
But this availability
of information and transparency

00:00:33.458 --> 00:00:37.083
almost completely disappears
when it comes to consumer products.

00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:41.518
If you go to the seafood counter
at your local supermarket,

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:45.351
you can probably choose
between several different types of fish.

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:47.934
But chances are,
they won't be able to tell you

00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:51.101
who caught the fish,
where precisely it was caught,

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:53.393
whether it is sustainable
to catch it there

00:00:53.417 --> 00:00:55.458
and how it got transported.

00:00:56.083 --> 00:00:58.976
And that holds true
for almost everything we buy.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.768
Every can of soup,

00:01:00.792 --> 00:01:03.309
every piece of meat, every T-shirt.

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.601
We as humans, right now,

00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:09.143
are destroying the only thing
we really need to survive:

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:10.434
our planet.

00:01:10.458 --> 00:01:13.476
And most of the horrible problems
that we're facing today,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.768
like climate change

00:01:14.792 --> 00:01:17.476
and modern slavery in supply chains,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.226
come down to decisions.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.934
Human decisions to produce something
one way and not another.

00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.184
And that's how we, as consumers,

00:01:27.208 --> 00:01:30.184
end up making decisions
that harm the planet

00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:31.851
or our fellow humans.

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:33.958
By choosing the wrong products.

00:01:35.167 --> 00:01:38.518
But I refuse to believe
that anybody here in this room,

00:01:38.542 --> 00:01:40.601
or frankly, anybody on this planet,

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:42.518
really wants to buy a product

00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:45.976
that harms the planet
or our fellow humans

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.333
if given the choice.

00:01:48.583 --> 00:01:50.768
But you see, choice is a loaded word.

00:01:50.792 --> 00:01:53.143
Choice means there's another option.

00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:56.184
Choice means you can afford that option.

00:01:56.208 --> 00:01:57.684
But choice also means

00:01:57.708 --> 00:02:01.768
you have enough information
to make an informed decision.

00:02:01.792 --> 00:02:06.851
And that information nowadays
simply just doesn't exist.

00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:10.125
Or at least it's really,
really hard to access.

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:13.643
But I think this is about to change.

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:17.726
Because we can use technology
to solve this information problem.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.809
And many of the specific technologies
that we need to do that

00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:24.518
have become better and cheaper
over the recent years,

00:02:24.542 --> 00:02:27.434
and are now ready to be used at scale.

00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:28.851
So, over the past two years,

00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:30.559
my team and I have been working

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:34.809
with one of the world's largest
conservation organizations, WWF,

00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:38.476
and we've founded a company called OpenSC,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.833
where SC stands for supply chain.

00:02:41.708 --> 00:02:44.101
And we believe that by using technology

00:02:44.125 --> 00:02:47.476
we can help to create

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.809
transparency and traceability
in supply chains,

00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:54.351
and through that,
help to completely revolutionize

00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:58.958
the way that we buy
and also produce products as humans.

00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:04.184
Now, some of this is going to sound
a little bit like science fiction,

00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:06.059
but it's already happening.

00:03:06.083 --> 00:03:07.333
Let me explain.

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:10.809
So, in order to solve
this information problem,

00:03:10.833 --> 00:03:12.518
we need to do three things:

00:03:12.542 --> 00:03:15.809
verify, trace and share.

00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:19.309
Verify specific sustainability

00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:21.143
and ethical production claims

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:24.018
in a data-based and automated way.

00:03:24.042 --> 00:03:26.893
Then trace those
individual physical products

00:03:26.917 --> 00:03:28.601
throughout their supply chains,

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.643
and finally, share
that information with consumers

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:34.101
in a way that truly gives them a choice

00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:36.101
and lets them make consumption decisions

00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:38.934
that are more aligned with their values.

00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:42.268
I'm going to use a real product

00:03:42.292 --> 00:03:46.726
and a supply chain where we've made
all of this a reality already:

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.018
a Patagonian toothfish,

00:03:48.042 --> 00:03:51.059
or Chilean sea bass,
as it's called in the US.

00:03:51.083 --> 00:03:52.833
Number one, verify.

00:03:53.792 --> 00:03:56.351
Verify how something is produced.

00:03:56.375 --> 00:03:59.184
But not just by saying,
"Trust me, this is good,

00:03:59.208 --> 00:04:01.393
trust me, we've done
all the right things,"

00:04:01.417 --> 00:04:05.434
but by producing evidence
for that individual physical product,

00:04:05.458 --> 00:04:07.726
and the way it was produced.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.018
By producing evidence

00:04:09.042 --> 00:04:12.809
for a specific sustainability
or ethical production claim.

00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:15.684
So for example, in the case of the fish,

00:04:15.708 --> 00:04:19.601
has this fish been caught in an area
where there's enough of them,

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:21.643
so that it's sustainable
to catch it there

00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:24.351
and not in a marine protected area?

00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:25.726
So what we're doing here

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.643
is we're taking almost real-time
GPS data from the ship --

00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:31.184
the ship that's fishing --

00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:33.434
and that tells us where the ship is

00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:36.018
and where it's going at what speed.

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:39.184
And we can then combine that
with other types of data,

00:04:39.208 --> 00:04:41.976
like, for example,
how deep the sea floor is.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.643
And combining all of this information,

00:04:44.667 --> 00:04:48.809
our machine-learning algorithms
can then verify, in an automated way,

00:04:48.833 --> 00:04:52.625
whether the ship is only fishing
where it's supposed to, or not.

00:04:53.875 --> 00:04:56.434
And as sensors become cheaper,

00:04:56.458 --> 00:04:58.476
we can put them in more places.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.851
And that means we can capture more data,

00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:03.684
and combining that
with advancements in data science,

00:05:03.708 --> 00:05:06.976
it means that we can now verify

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.018
specific sustainability
and ethical production claims

00:05:11.042 --> 00:05:15.226
in an automated, real-time
and ongoing manner.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.393
And that really lays the basis
for this information revolution.

00:05:19.417 --> 00:05:21.601
So, number two, trace.

00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:24.684
Trace those individual physical products,

00:05:24.708 --> 00:05:26.726
so that we can truly say

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.476
that the claim that we've verified
about a certain product

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.476
actually belongs
to that individual product

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.018
that we as consumers
have right in front of us.

00:05:35.042 --> 00:05:38.351
Because without
that level of traceability,

00:05:38.375 --> 00:05:41.226
all that we've really
verified in the first place

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.101
is that somebody, somewhere, at some point

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:46.434
caught a fish in a sustainable way,

00:05:46.458 --> 00:05:51.351
or didn't harm the employee
when asking them to produce a T-shirt,

00:05:51.375 --> 00:05:56.208
or didn't use pesticides when growing
a vegetable that didn't actually need it.

00:05:57.292 --> 00:06:01.226
Only if I give a product
an identity from the start

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.018
and then trace it
throughout the whole supply chain,

00:06:04.042 --> 00:06:07.643
can this claim and the value
that's been created

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:09.976
by producing it in the right way

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.583
truly stay with it.

00:06:13.542 --> 00:06:16.143
Now, I've talked about cheaper sensors.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:18.643
There are many other
technological developments

00:06:18.667 --> 00:06:22.893
that make all of this much more possible
today than every before.

00:06:22.917 --> 00:06:25.875
For example, the falling costs of tags.

00:06:26.792 --> 00:06:29.851
You give a product a name,

00:06:29.875 --> 00:06:31.893
a serial number, an identity,

00:06:31.917 --> 00:06:34.101
the tag is its passport.

00:06:34.125 --> 00:06:37.434
What you can see here
is a toothfish being caught.

00:06:37.458 --> 00:06:39.768
This is what's called a longline fishery,

00:06:39.792 --> 00:06:44.018
so the fish are coming up
onto the boat on individual hooks.

00:06:44.042 --> 00:06:46.309
And as soon as the fish is on board,

00:06:46.333 --> 00:06:48.601
it is killed, and then after that,

00:06:48.625 --> 00:06:52.059
we insert a small tag
into the fish's flesh.

00:06:52.083 --> 00:06:56.601
And in that tag, there is an RFID chip
with a unique serial number,

00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:59.643
and that tag follows the fish
throughout the whole supply chain

00:06:59.667 --> 00:07:01.851
and makes it really easy
to sense its presence

00:07:01.875 --> 00:07:05.393
at any port, on any truck
or in any processing plant.

00:07:05.417 --> 00:07:08.684
But consumers can't really read RFID tags.

00:07:08.708 --> 00:07:12.934
And so, when it comes to filleting
and packaging the fish,

00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:15.851
we read the RFID tag and then remove it.

00:07:15.875 --> 00:07:20.101
And then we add a unique QR code
to the packaging of the fish.

00:07:20.125 --> 00:07:24.601
And that QR code then points back
to the same information

00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:27.375
that we've verified about the fish
in the first place.

00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:32.934
And so, depending on the type
of product that we're working with,

00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:36.726
we may use QR codes, bar codes, RFID tags

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.518
or other tag technologies.

00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:40.643
But there are also technologies

00:07:40.667 --> 00:07:43.059
that are at the brink
of large-scale breakthrough

00:07:43.083 --> 00:07:45.059
that make tags themselves obsolete.

00:07:45.083 --> 00:07:46.684
Like, for example,

00:07:46.708 --> 00:07:49.434
analyzing a product for trace elements

00:07:49.458 --> 00:07:52.976
that can then tell you quite accurately
where it is actually from.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.393
Then there's blockchain.

00:07:54.417 --> 00:07:59.226
A decentralized technology
can act as a catalyst for this revolution.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:03.018
Because it can help mitigate
some of the trust issues

00:08:03.042 --> 00:08:06.518
that are inherent
to giving people information

00:08:06.542 --> 00:08:09.726
and then asking them
to change their consumption behavior

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.101
because of that information.

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:14.809
And so, we use blockchain technology

00:08:14.833 --> 00:08:18.059
where it adds value to what we're doing.

00:08:18.083 --> 00:08:19.351
But importantly,

00:08:19.375 --> 00:08:22.518
we don't let the limitations
that this technology still has today,

00:08:22.542 --> 00:08:24.601
like, for example,
with regards to scaling,

00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:26.601
we don't let that stand in our way.

00:08:26.625 --> 00:08:29.101
And that brings us to the third point.

00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:30.393
Share.

00:08:30.417 --> 00:08:34.268
How to share the information
that we've verified and tracked

00:08:34.292 --> 00:08:37.101
about where a product is from,
how it was produced

00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:39.601
and how it got to where it is?

00:08:39.625 --> 00:08:41.559
How to share this information

00:08:41.583 --> 00:08:44.434
is really different
from product to product.

00:08:44.458 --> 00:08:46.768
And different from where you buy it.

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:49.351
You behave differently
in those situations.

00:08:49.375 --> 00:08:53.018
You are stressed and time-poor
in the supermarket.

00:08:53.042 --> 00:08:55.309
Or with short attention span over dinner,

00:08:55.333 --> 00:08:57.518
because your date is so cute.

00:08:57.542 --> 00:09:00.559
Or you are critical and inquisitive

00:09:00.583 --> 00:09:03.750
when researching
for a larger purchase online.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.351
And so for our fish,

00:09:06.375 --> 00:09:09.309
we've developed a digital experience

00:09:09.333 --> 00:09:15.101
that works when buying the fish
in a freezer in a fish specialty store

00:09:15.125 --> 00:09:18.934
and that gives you all of the information
about the fish and its journey.

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.601
But we also worked with a restaurant

00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:24.601
and developed a different
digital experience

00:09:24.625 --> 00:09:28.184
that only summarizes the key facts
about the fish and its journey,

00:09:28.208 --> 00:09:30.643
and works better in a dinner setting

00:09:30.667 --> 00:09:34.226
and, hopefully, there
doesn't annoy your date too much.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.601
Now, that brings us full circle.

00:09:36.625 --> 00:09:39.643
We've verified that the fish was caught

00:09:39.667 --> 00:09:42.643
in an area where
it's sustainable to do so.

00:09:42.667 --> 00:09:45.268
We've then traced it throughout
the entire supply chain

00:09:45.292 --> 00:09:49.393
to maintain its identity and all
the information that's attached to it.

00:09:49.417 --> 00:09:51.976
And then, we've shared
that information with consumers

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.809
in a way that gives them a choice

00:09:53.833 --> 00:09:55.976
and lets them make consumption decisions

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.542
that are more in line with their values.

00:09:59.542 --> 00:10:03.643
Now, for this fish example,
this is already rolled out at scale.

00:10:03.667 --> 00:10:04.934
This season,

00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.518
the entire fleet of the world's largest
toothfish fishing company,

00:10:08.542 --> 00:10:09.893
Austral Fisheries,

00:10:09.917 --> 00:10:12.768
is tagging every single fish
that they catch

00:10:12.792 --> 00:10:16.125
and that ends up in their premium
branded "Glacier 51" product.

00:10:17.208 --> 00:10:19.351
And you can already buy this fish.

00:10:19.375 --> 00:10:23.268
And with it, you can have all
of the information I talked about today,

00:10:23.292 --> 00:10:24.768
and much more,

00:10:24.792 --> 00:10:29.042
attached to each individual fish
or portion of the fish that you may buy.

00:10:30.583 --> 00:10:34.643
But this is not a fish or seafood thing.

00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:37.851
We're working on many, many
different commodities and products

00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:40.268
and their supply chains across the globe.

00:10:40.292 --> 00:10:42.893
From dairy to fruit and vegetables,

00:10:42.917 --> 00:10:45.684
to nonfood products made out of wood.

00:10:45.708 --> 00:10:50.226
As a consumer, all of this
may sound like a huge burden,

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.768
because you don't have time
to look at all of this information

00:10:53.792 --> 00:10:56.268
every time you buy something.

00:10:56.292 --> 00:10:58.018
And I don't expect you to,

00:10:58.042 --> 00:11:01.143
because you'll have help with that.

00:11:01.167 --> 00:11:06.518
In the future, we'll leave the decision
of which specific product to buy

00:11:06.542 --> 00:11:08.726
increasingly up to machines.

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.976
An algorithm will know enough about you

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.476
to make those decisions for you,
so you don't have to.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.351
And maybe it will even do
a better job at it.

00:11:18.375 --> 00:11:20.809
In a recent study, 85 percent of those

00:11:20.833 --> 00:11:23.851
buying a product
through a virtual assistant

00:11:23.875 --> 00:11:25.684
said that they, on occasion,

00:11:25.708 --> 00:11:28.059
actually went with the top
product recommendation

00:11:28.083 --> 00:11:29.351
of that virtual assistant,

00:11:29.375 --> 00:11:31.434
rather than the specific product or brand

00:11:31.458 --> 00:11:34.184
that they set out
to buy in the first place.

00:11:34.208 --> 00:11:36.018
You just say you need toilet paper,

00:11:36.042 --> 00:11:40.476
it's then an algorithm that decides
which brand, price point

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.559
or whether you go with recycled or not.

00:11:43.583 --> 00:11:47.809
Well, nowadays this is usually based
on what you bought in the past,

00:11:47.833 --> 00:11:52.018
or whoever pays the most to the company
behind the virtual assistant.

00:11:52.042 --> 00:11:56.458
But why shouldn't that be also
based on your values?

00:11:57.625 --> 00:12:00.184
Knowing that you want
to buy planet-friendly

00:12:00.208 --> 00:12:05.684
and knowing whether and how much
you're willing and able to pay for that.

00:12:05.708 --> 00:12:09.226
Now, that will make it easy and seamless,

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.518
but still based
on granular effects and data

00:12:11.542 --> 00:12:13.601
to choose the right products.

00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:15.851
Not by necessarily doing it yourself

00:12:15.875 --> 00:12:18.184
but by asking an algorithm

00:12:18.208 --> 00:12:21.768
that knows how much you care
about this planet.

00:12:21.792 --> 00:12:23.768
Not by necessarily doing it yourself

00:12:23.792 --> 00:12:25.893
but by asking an algorithm

00:12:25.917 --> 00:12:28.708
that is never time-poor or distracted,

00:12:29.792 --> 00:12:33.601
or with short attention span
because of the cute date,

00:12:33.625 --> 00:12:36.351
and that knows how much
you care about this planet

00:12:36.375 --> 00:12:37.809
and the people living on it,

00:12:37.833 --> 00:12:41.684
by asking that algorithm to look
at all of that information for you

00:12:41.708 --> 00:12:43.208
and to decide for you.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.684
If we have reliable
and trustworthy information like that

00:12:48.708 --> 00:12:51.184
and the right systems that make use of it,

00:12:51.208 --> 00:12:54.559
consumers will support those
who are doing the right thing

00:12:54.583 --> 00:12:58.684
by producing products
in a sustainable and ethical way.

00:12:58.708 --> 00:13:00.726
They will support them every time

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.083
by choosing their goods over others.

00:13:04.042 --> 00:13:08.976
And that means that good
producers and processors and retailers

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.268
will get rewarded.

00:13:10.292 --> 00:13:14.643
And bad actors will be forced
to adjust their practices

00:13:14.667 --> 00:13:16.542
or get out of business.

00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:18.976
And we need that.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.768
If we want to continue to live together
on this beautiful planet,

00:13:22.792 --> 00:13:24.643
we really need it.

00:13:24.667 --> 00:13:25.934
Thank you.

00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.458
(Applause)
