00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.080
When is seeing not believing?

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.656
A couple years ago, my friend
sent me this photo from Ürümqi,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.776
which is the capital of Xinjiang
province in northwest China.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.136
On this particular day,
she couldn't believe her eyes.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.400
Checking the quality of the air outside
using this app on her iPad,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.296
the numbers were telling her
the air quality was good,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.160
one on a scale of 500.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.840
But when she looked outside,
she saw something much different.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.896
Yes, those are buildings
in the background.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.240
(Laughter)

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.096
But the data were simply
not telling the truth

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.536
of what people were seeing and breathing,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.136
and it's because they were
failing to measure PM2.5,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.416
or fine particulate pollution.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.336
When PM2.5 levels
went off the charts in 2012,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.336
or "crazy bad," as the US Embassy
once described it in a tweet,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.536
Chinese denizens took to social media

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.216
and they started to question why it was
that they were seeing this disconnect

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.256
between official air quality statistics

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.000
and what they were seeing
and breathing for themselves.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.536
Now, this questioning has led

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.976
to an environmental awakening
of sorts in China,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.560
forcing China's government
to tackle its pollution problems.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.800
Now China has the opportunity
to become a global environmental leader.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.936
But the picture
that I'll paint for you today

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.616
is one that's mixed.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.376
There are some signs
that are very promising,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.776
and there are other trends
that are more troubling

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.416
that warrant closer attention.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.480
But now let's go back
to the story at hand.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.416
I started to witness the beginnings
of China's green evolution

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.296
when I was a PhD student
conducting fieldwork in China in 2011.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.776
I traveled all across the country
seeking answers to the question

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.296
that I often got myself
from the skeptical outsider:

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.136
What, you mean China is doing
something on the environment?

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.776
They have environmental policies?

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.000
What policies?

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.976
At that time, PM2.5 data
was considered too politically sensitive

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.696
and so the government
was keeping it secret,

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.496
but citizens were becoming aware
of its harmful human health effects,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.616
and they were demanding
greater transparency

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.096
on the part of the government.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.296
I actually started to see some of this
growing evolution and awareness myself

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.800
cropping up all over China.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.456
Department stores, for example,
started to market these air purifiers

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.040
that could filter out harmful PM2.5.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.136
Citizens were also adopting PM2.5
as the title of musical festivals.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.456
(Laughter)

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.976
And then I went to a golf course
in Shenzhen, which is in southern China,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.416
and you can see from this banner,
they're advertising a retreat from PM2.5.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.880
Golf sub-par, but don't
breathe sub-par air.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.776
And then Shanghai's
Environmental Protection Bureau

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.376
decided to create a mascot
named after the air quality index

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.640
to better communicate
the air quality data to its people.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.376
I call her AQI Girl,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.600
and her expression and hair color changes
depending on the quality of air outside.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.176
Five years later and she's still
the mostly smiling face

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.560
of Shanghai's air quality.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.336
And then in 2015,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.736
former CCTV reporter Chai Jing

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.320
created this documentary
called "Under the Dome."

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.016
It would be likened
to Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring."

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.856
And much like Rachel Carson

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.696
brought to attention the fact
that pesticides were harming human health,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.496
"Under the Dome" stamped
into the popular consciousness

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.016
that air pollution was leading
to one million premature deaths

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.240
every year in China alone.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.376
This video garnered

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.296
more than a hundred million
views in a single weekend

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.216
before China's government,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.136
fearing that it might incite
some type of social unrest,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.520
pulled it from the internet.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.600
But the damage had already been done.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.296
Public outcry over air pollution

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.216
galvanized China's government,

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.656
perhaps in an act of self-preservation,

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.176
to think big and decisively
about how it could tackle

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.216
the root of its air pollution

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.856
and many of its other
environmental problems:

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.080
its energy system.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.856
For you see, in China,

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.720
about two thirds of its
electricity comes from coal.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.456
China has more coal-fired power plants
than any other country in the world,

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.920
about 40 percent of the global total,

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.976
and it's because of this fact
that China's government

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.176
has decided since 2014
to wage a war on coal,

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.456
shutting down small coal mines,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.016
setting limits on coal consumption,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.440
even canceling an Australia's worth
of coal-fired power plants.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.256
They've also been making
enormous investments

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.536
when it comes to clean
and renewable energy,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.496
like hydropower, wind and solar,

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.416
and the pace and the scale
of this transformation

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.296
has been absolutely mind-blowing.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.736
Let me give you a couple of statistics
to show you what I mean.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.376
China leads the world
when it comes to hydropower,

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.040
with a third of total capacity.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.176
There's enough for every Chinese citizen

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.200
to power two homes in a single year
from hydropower alone.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.976
You may have heard
of the Three Gorges Dam,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.216
pictured here,

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.486
which is the largest
power station in the world,

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.016
and it's powered by water.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.376
In terms of wind power,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.456
China has a third of the global capacity.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.640
This makes it the number one
leader by far.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.456
When we look at solar,
China's also leading.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.016
In fact, they crushed their 2020 target

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.496
of installing 105 gigawatts
of solar power.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.856
This is after the government
already revised upwards

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.536
several times its solar energy target

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.720
between 2009 and 2015.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.296
Last year, in seven months alone,

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.016
China was able to install
a whopping 35 gigawatts of solar power.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.776
This is more than half
of what the US has combined in total

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.120
and China did this
in just seven months alone.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.136
We can verify this remarkable growth
in solar power from space,

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.840
like the startup SpaceKnow
has done in this slide.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.576
By 2020, China is on track to generate
Germany's entire electricity consumption

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.040
from just wind and solar power alone.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.960
It's pretty darn remarkable.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.536
And we see some evidence now

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.696
that China's efforts on clean energy

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.816
is actually having an effect,

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.816
not just on air pollution reduction,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.536
but also on global climate change,

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.070
where China has the world's
largest carbon footprint.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.016
If we look at some of the data,
we can see that China's coal consumption

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.440
may have already reached a peak
as early as 2013.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.696
This is a major reason
why China's government announced

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.296
that actually they've already achieved
their 2020 carbon reduction pledge

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.520
ahead of schedule.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.336
This reduction in coal consumption

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.336
is also directly driving
improvements in air quality

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.736
across the country,

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.360
as I've shown here in blue.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.816
In most major Chinese cities,

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.720
air pollution has fallen
by as much as 30 percent.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.736
And this reduction in air pollution
is actually leading people

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.736
to live longer lives in China,

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.760
on average two and a half years more
than they would have in 2013.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.656
In yellow, we can see
the cities that have experienced

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.633
the greatest improvements in air quality.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.496
But of course, as I mentioned
at the beginning of this talk,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.536
we have to temper some of this optimism

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.736
with a healthy dose of caution,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.480
and that's largely because
the data are still being determined.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.136
At the end of last year,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.336
after roughly three years
of pretty steady global carbon emissions,

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.896
scientific projections suggest

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.776
that global emissions
may be on the rise again

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.936
and that could be due to increases
in China's fossil fuel consumptions,

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.216
so they may not have reached
that peak that I showed earlier.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.856
But of course, the statistics
and the data are still murky

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:11.056
and that's because China regularly revises
its coal statistics after the fact.

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.576
Actually, it's funny,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.296
since I've been here I've been
having a debate on Twitter

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.856
with other climate modelers,

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.376
trying to figure out
whether China's carbon emissions

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.080
have gone up, gone down or whether
they're staying relatively stable.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.720
And of course, China is still
a rapidly developing country.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.856
It's still experimenting
with a range of policies,

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.496
like dockless bike sharing,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.760
which has been hailed as a possible
sustainable transport solution.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.336
But then we have images
of this bicycle graveyard

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.280
that tell a more cautionary tale.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.976
Sometimes, solutions can move too fast

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.240
and outpace demand.

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:50.360
And of course,
coal is still king in China,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.400
at least for now.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:57.056
So why should we care about
what China is doing on the environment?

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.136
Well, what China does at home
on the environment

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.896
can have global implications
for the rest of us.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.856
To borrow a line from Chai Jing,

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.736
we're all under the same dome,

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.416
and air pollution that originates in China

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.536
can travel beyond its borders

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.840
and affect populations
as far away as those in North America.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.776
China's not only exporting air pollution,

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:23.320
but they're also exporting aid,
infrastructure, technology abroad.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.776
President Xi Jinping in 2013 announced
the One Belt, One Road Initiative,

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.176
a massive, one-trillion-US-dollar
infrastructure investment project

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.960
in more than 60 other countries.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.656
And historically, when we've seen

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.576
that China has made
these infrastructure investments abroad,

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.200
they haven't always been clean.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.336
The Global Environment Institute,
a Chinese civil society group,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.736
found that in the last 15 years,

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.816
China has invested in more
than 240 coal-fired power plants

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.936
in more than 68 countries

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.736
affiliated with the One Belt,
One Road Initiative.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:02.896
That's more than a quarter of China's
own domestic coal-fired capacity

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.736
that is exported abroad.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.896
So we can see that even though
China is cleaning up at home,

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.096
it's exporting some of that pollution

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.616
to other countries,

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.400
and greenhouse gas emissions
simply don't have a passport.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.416
So when we're trying
to evaluate this question

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.536
of whether or not China
is actually leading,

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.120
we can see it's still
very much an open debate.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.656
But time is running out.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.136
I've studied the climate models,
and the outlook is not good.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.696
We still have a gap
between current policies

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.440
and what needs to happen if we want
to avoid dangerous climate change.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.776
Leadership is what we desperately need,

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.296
but it's not coming
from the US, for example.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.336
The US administration last June
announced its intent

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.976
to withdraw from
the Paris Climate Agreement,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.440
so now people are looking towards China
to fill that leadership void.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.416
So China is very much in the driver's seat

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.760
determining our global
environmental future.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.816
What they do on carbon trading,

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.280
on clean energy, on air pollution,

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.280
we can learn many lessons.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.216
One of those lessons is that clean energy
is not just good for the environment,

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.560
it can save lives
by reducing air pollution.

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.160
It's also good for the economy.

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.136
We can see that last year,

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.496
China was responsible
for 30 percent of the global growth

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.896
in green jobs.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.400
The US? Only six.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.216
So the picture that I just painted for you

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.416
hopefully seems much different

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.576
from those murky,
foggy air quality statistics

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.056
to a much clearer picture
of China's clean energy.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.016
And even though China
is headed in the right direction,

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.760
we know that there's still
a very long road ahead.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.240
So let me ask you once more:
Is seeing believing?

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.816
Can we trust the data and the statistics

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.096
that show that China's
air quality is coming down

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.360
and that its war on coal
is actually having an effect?

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.856
Well, let's take a look
at some of the latest satellite images

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.240
of China's solar power installations.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.200
I want you to look
very closely at this image.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.640
Can you see?

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.336
The proof may just be in the pandas.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.576
Thank you so much.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:17.360
(Applause)
