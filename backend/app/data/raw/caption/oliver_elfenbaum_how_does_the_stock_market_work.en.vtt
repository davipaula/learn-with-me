00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.900
In the 1600s

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.320
the Dutch East India Company 
employed hundreds of ships

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.190
to trade gold, porcelain, spices, 
and silks around the globe.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.080
But running this massive 
operation wasn’t cheap.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.750
In order to fund their expensive voyages,

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.290
the company turned to private citizens–

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.620
individuals who could invest money 
to support the trip

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.600
in exchange for a share 
of the ship’s profits.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.660
This practice allowed the company 
to afford even grander voyages,

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.519
increasing profits for both 
themselves and their savvy investors.

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:44.329
Selling these shares in coffee houses 
and shipping ports across the continent,

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.362
the Dutch East India Company unknowingly
invented the world’s first stock market.

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:54.467
Since then, companies have been 
collecting funds from willing investors

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:56.641
to support all kinds of businesses.

00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:57.521
And today,

00:00:57.521 --> 00:01:02.431
the stock market has schools, careers,
and even whole television channels

00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:04.276
dedicated to understanding it.

00:01:04.276 --> 00:01:07.896
But the modern stock market is 
significantly more complicated

00:01:07.896 --> 00:01:09.916
than its original incarnation.

00:01:09.916 --> 00:01:14.086
So how do companies and investors
use the market today?

00:01:14.086 --> 00:01:18.746
Let’s imagine a new coffee company 
that decides to launch on the market.

00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:22.356
First, the company will advertise itself 
to big investors.

00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:24.426
If they think the company is a good idea,

00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:26.376
they get the first crack at investing,

00:01:26.376 --> 00:01:31.236
and then sponsor the company’s initial 
public offering, or IPO.

00:01:31.236 --> 00:01:34.691
This launches the company onto the 
official public market,

00:01:34.691 --> 00:01:38.461
where any company or individual who 
believes the business could be profitable

00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:39.721
might buy a stock.

00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:44.281
Buying stocks makes those investors 
partial owners in the business.

00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:46.650
Their investment helps 
the company to grow,

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.480
and as it becomes more successful,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.980
more buyers may see potential 
and start buying stocks.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.320
As demand for those stocks increases,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.000
so does their price, increasing 
the cost for prospective buyers,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.930
and raising the value of the company's 
stocks people already own.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.210
For the company,

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.660
this increased interest helps 
fund new initiatives,

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.520
and also boosts its overall market value

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.380
by showing how many people 
are willing to invest in their idea.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.230
However, if for some reason a company 
starts to seem less profitable

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.490
the reverse can also happen.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.570
If investors think their stock 
value is going to decline,

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.610
they’ll sell their stocks with the hopes 
of making a profit

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.770
before the company loses more value.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.090
As stocks are sold and demand 
for the stock goes down,

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.480
the stock price falls,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.850
and with it, the company’s market value.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.520
This can leave investors with big losses–

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.840
unless the company starts to look 
profitable again.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.320
This see-saw of supply and demand 
is influenced by many factors.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.337
Companies are under the unavoidable 
influence of market forces–

00:02:49.337 --> 00:02:51.757
such as the fluctuating 
price of materials,

00:02:51.757 --> 00:02:53.707
changes in production technology,

00:02:53.707 --> 00:02:56.017
and the shifting costs of labor.

00:02:56.017 --> 00:02:58.827
Investors may be worried about 
changes in leadership,

00:02:58.827 --> 00:03:03.367
bad publicity, or larger factors like 
new laws and trade policies.

00:03:03.367 --> 00:03:04.427
And of course,

00:03:04.427 --> 00:03:07.877
plenty of investors are simply ready 
to sell valuable stocks

00:03:07.877 --> 00:03:09.947
and pursue personal interests.

00:03:09.947 --> 00:03:13.207
All these variables cause day-to-day noise
in the market,

00:03:13.207 --> 00:03:16.127
which can make companies appear more
or less successful.

00:03:16.127 --> 00:03:17.327
And in the stock market,

00:03:17.327 --> 00:03:20.997
appearing to lose value often leads 
to losing investors,

00:03:20.997 --> 00:03:23.817
and in turn, losing actual value.

00:03:23.817 --> 00:03:26.857
Human confidence in the market has the
power to trigger

00:03:26.857 --> 00:03:30.437
everything from economic booms 
to financial crises.

00:03:30.437 --> 00:03:32.537
And this difficult-to-track 
variable

00:03:32.537 --> 00:03:36.387
is why most professionals promote 
reliable long term investing

00:03:36.387 --> 00:03:38.457
over trying to make quick cash.

00:03:38.457 --> 00:03:41.397
However, experts are constantly 
building tools

00:03:41.397 --> 00:03:43.797
in efforts to increase their 
chances of success

00:03:43.797 --> 00:03:45.797
in this highly unpredictable system.

00:03:45.797 --> 00:03:49.267
But the stock market is not just 
for the rich and powerful.

00:03:49.267 --> 00:03:50.717
With the dawn of the Internet,

00:03:50.717 --> 00:03:52.587
everyday investors can buy stocks

00:03:52.587 --> 00:03:56.127
in many of the exact same ways 
a large investor would.

00:03:56.127 --> 00:03:59.797
And as more people educate themselves 
about this complex system

00:03:59.797 --> 00:04:01.217
they too can trade stocks,

00:04:01.217 --> 00:04:03.177
support the businesses they believe in,

00:04:03.177 --> 00:04:05.467
and pursue their financial goals.

00:04:05.467 --> 00:04:08.687
The first step is getting invested.
