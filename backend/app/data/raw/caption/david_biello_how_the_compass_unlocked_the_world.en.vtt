00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:13.479
Growing up in Missouri,

00:00:13.503 --> 00:00:16.155
they would kind of take us
out into the woods,

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.238
and they would give you a map,
and they would give you a compass,

00:00:19.262 --> 00:00:20.887
and you had to find your way home.

00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:22.583
And without the compass,

00:00:22.607 --> 00:00:24.089
you can't even read the map.

00:00:24.113 --> 00:00:25.715
That's what I'm here to tell you.

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:26.972
The compass is the key.

00:00:26.996 --> 00:00:28.228
[Small thing.]

00:00:28.252 --> 00:00:30.124
[Big idea.]

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.256
A compass is most simply a piece of metal
that has been magnetized,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.729
so that it will turn towards
the Earth's magnetic pole.

00:00:40.753 --> 00:00:43.655
The one that we all think of
is the pocket compass.

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:45.200
It looks like a watch, right?

00:00:45.224 --> 00:00:46.639
You can hold it in your hand

00:00:46.663 --> 00:00:49.045
and watch the little needle bounce around

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:50.596
until you find north.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.618
Magnetism is still a pretty
mysterious force to physicists,

00:00:54.642 --> 00:00:57.825
but what we do know for sure
is that a compass works

00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:00.071
because the Earth is this giant magnet.

00:01:00.095 --> 00:01:01.757
And when you use a compass,

00:01:01.781 --> 00:01:05.435
you are in touch with
the very center of our planet,

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.245
where this kind of roiling
ball of molten iron

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:12.235
is spinning around
and creating a magnetic field.

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.035
Just like a magnet you can
play with on your tabletop,

00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:16.931
it has a north pole and a south pole,

00:01:16.955 --> 00:01:20.165
and we use compasses to find our way
north because of that fact.

00:01:20.743 --> 00:01:25.798
The earliest known compass comes
from about 200 BC in China.

00:01:25.822 --> 00:01:29.047
They figured out that some of the metal
coming out of the ground

00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:30.334
was naturally magnetic,

00:01:30.358 --> 00:01:33.106
and so they fashioned
this magnetized metal

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.959
into this kind of ladle-looking thing,

00:01:34.983 --> 00:01:36.466
put it on a brass plate

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.926
and then it would point north.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.730
It seems to have been primarily
used to improve feng shui,

00:01:40.754 --> 00:01:44.281
so they could figure out
what was the best way for energy to flow

00:01:44.305 --> 00:01:46.044
through their living spaces.

00:01:46.068 --> 00:01:48.769
Sailors were probably the early adopters

00:01:48.793 --> 00:01:51.184
of the more portable versions of it,

00:01:51.208 --> 00:01:52.932
because no matter where the sun was,

00:01:52.956 --> 00:01:55.152
no matter what the condition
of the stars were,

00:01:55.176 --> 00:01:57.042
they would always
be able to find north.

00:01:57.066 --> 00:02:00.568
Now, much later, the Europeans
are the ones who innovate

00:02:00.592 --> 00:02:02.418
and come up with the compass rose.

00:02:02.442 --> 00:02:03.765
It essentially laid out

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.335
what north, south, east
and west looked like,

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:09.795
and it also enabled you
to kind of create new directions,

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.916
like northwest, southeast, what have you.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.648
And for the first time,
they knew where they were going.

00:02:15.672 --> 00:02:17.239
That's kind of a big deal.

00:02:17.263 --> 00:02:21.146
But also, I think it was part
of this general reinvigoration

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.565
of European science.

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:24.385
You might know it as the Renaissance.

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.685
Lots of new tools were invented,

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.635
from the telescope to the microscope.

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.176
Maps got better because
of compasses, right?

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.450
Because then you start to understand
which direction is which,

00:02:34.474 --> 00:02:35.784
you get a lot more detail,

00:02:35.808 --> 00:02:37.497
and that just kind of changes

00:02:37.521 --> 00:02:39.855
the human relationship to the world.

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.555
The compass with a map
is like a superpower.

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.305
Everything that we think
of as world history

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.909
would not have taken place
without the compass:

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:51.812
the age of exploration, Magellan
circumnavigating the globe,

00:02:51.836 --> 00:02:53.945
even the fact that we know it is a globe.

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:57.400
The compass ends up getting embedded
in all these other tools,

00:02:57.424 --> 00:02:59.767
because it is such a functional object.

00:02:59.791 --> 00:03:02.455
So you might have it
embedded in your multi-tool,

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:04.412
you might have it
embedded in your phone.

00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:05.692
The compass is everywhere,

00:03:05.716 --> 00:03:09.555
because it's literally how we find our way
across the face of the Earth.

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.275
So you can go off and explore,

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.673
and find out what is over that next hill
or that next horizon,

00:03:15.697 --> 00:03:18.681
but you can also reliably
find your way home.
