00:00:10.507 --> 00:00:12.650
I want to talk to you about two

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.925
of the most exciting possible things.

00:00:16.925 --> 00:00:22.071
You probably guess what they are
-- data and history.

00:00:22.071 --> 00:00:27.131
Right? So, I'm not a historian.

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:29.465
I'm not going to give you
a definition of history,

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.723
but let's think instead
of history within a framework.

00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:34.545
So when we are making history

00:00:34.545 --> 00:00:37.268
or when we are creating
historical documents

00:00:37.268 --> 00:00:39.697
we are taking things that have
happened in the past

00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:42.205
and we are stitching them
together into a story.

00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:44.881
So let me start with a little bit
of my own story.

00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:48.589
Like anybody my age who
works creatively with computers

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.941
I was a popular socially
well-adjusted young man --

00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:54.673
(Laughter)

00:00:54.673 --> 00:00:59.367
And sporty! Sporty young man.

00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:02.318
And like a lot of people my age

00:01:02.318 --> 00:01:04.635
in the kind of business that I'm in

00:01:04.635 --> 00:01:07.670
I was influenced tremendously by Apple.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.415
But notice my choice of logo here, right?

00:01:11.415 --> 00:01:15.712
The Apple on the left, not
the Apple on the right.

00:01:15.712 --> 00:01:18.130
I am influenced as much
by the Apple on the right

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.348
as the next person. But
the apple on the left

00:01:21.348 --> 00:01:23.396
I mean look at that logo,
it's a rainbow --

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.762
It's not even in the right order!

00:01:25.762 --> 00:01:29.340
That's how crazy Apple was. (Laughter)

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.572
But I don't want to talk too
much about the company.

00:01:32.572 --> 00:01:34.794
I'll start talking about a machine though.

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:37.024
How amazing it is to think about this,

00:01:37.024 --> 00:01:38.933
and I go back and I think about this --

00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:40.884
Wednesday, one Wednesday when I was

00:01:40.884 --> 00:01:44.894
about 12 years old,
I didn't have a computer.

00:01:44.894 --> 00:01:48.825
On Thursday, I had a computer.

00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:51.429
Can you imagine that change?

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:54.455
It's so drastic, I can't
even think about anything

00:01:54.455 --> 00:01:56.457
that could change our lives that way.

00:01:56.457 --> 00:01:58.624
But I'm actually not even going
to talk about the computer.

00:01:58.624 --> 00:02:00.228
I'm going to talk about a program

00:02:00.228 --> 00:02:02.031
that came loaded on that computer.

00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:04.798
And it was build by, not
the guy on the left,

00:02:04.798 --> 00:02:06.561
but the guy on the right.

00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:10.021
Does anybody know who the guy
on the right is?

00:02:10.021 --> 00:02:12.455
Nobody ever knows the answer
to this question!

00:02:12.455 --> 00:02:14.377
This is Bill Atkinson.

00:02:14.377 --> 00:02:17.296
And Bill Atkinson was responsible
for tons of things

00:02:17.296 --> 00:02:19.802
that you see on your computer everyday.

00:02:19.802 --> 00:02:21.892
But I want to talk about one program

00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:25.987
that Bill Atkinson wrote called Hypercard.

00:02:25.987 --> 00:02:28.004
Yeah -- someone is cheering over there.

00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:29.352
(Laughter)

00:02:29.352 --> 00:02:32.117
So, Hypercard was a program
that shipped with the Mac

00:02:32.117 --> 00:02:34.616
and it was designed
for users of the computer

00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:38.468
to make programs on their computers.

00:02:38.468 --> 00:02:41.125
Crazy idea today. And
these programs were not

00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:42.788
the apps that we think about today

00:02:42.788 --> 00:02:45.265
with their large budgets
and their big distribution.

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:47.694
These were small things.
People making applications

00:02:47.718 --> 00:02:50.575
to keep track of their local
basketball team scores

00:02:50.575 --> 00:02:53.424
or to organize their research

00:02:53.424 --> 00:02:56.464
or to teach people about classical music

00:02:56.464 --> 00:03:00.583
or to calculate weird astronomical dates.

00:03:00.583 --> 00:03:02.964
And then, of course, there
were some art projects.

00:03:02.988 --> 00:03:06.345
This is my favourite one,
it's called 'If monks had Macs'

00:03:06.345 --> 00:03:10.741
and it's a non-linear kind
of exploratory environment.

00:03:10.741 --> 00:03:16.500
I thank the stars for Hypercard
all of the time.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.194
And I thank the stars
for putting me in this era

00:03:19.194 --> 00:03:21.430
where I got to use Hypercard.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.476
Hypercard was the last program to ship

00:03:24.476 --> 00:03:27.459
on a public computer, that was designed

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.112
for the users of the computer
to make programs with it.

00:03:31.112 --> 00:03:33.937
If you talked to the people
who invented the computer

00:03:33.937 --> 00:03:35.795
and you told them there would be a day,

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.985
a magical day, when
everybody had a computer

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:41.700
but none of them knew how to program,

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.482
they would think you were crazy!

00:03:44.482 --> 00:03:46.396
So let's get forward a few years.

00:03:46.396 --> 00:03:48.646
I'm starting my career as an artist

00:03:48.646 --> 00:03:51.210
and I'm building things
with my computer --

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.615
small scale things. Investigating things

00:03:53.615 --> 00:03:56.259
like the growth systems of plants.

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:59.282
Or, in this example, I'm
building a simulated economy

00:03:59.282 --> 00:04:03.294
in which pixels are trading
colour with one another.

00:04:03.294 --> 00:04:05.834
Trying to investigate how these
types of systems work

00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:07.292
and just kind of having fun.

00:04:07.292 --> 00:04:09.959
And then this project led me
to start working with data.

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:12.957
So I'm building graphics like this,

00:04:12.957 --> 00:04:15.579
which compare "communism" -

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.017
the frequency of usage
of the word "communism"

00:04:18.017 --> 00:04:20.461
in the New York Times
to "terrorism" at the top.

00:04:20.461 --> 00:04:23.155
So you see "terrorism" kind of appears

00:04:23.155 --> 00:04:25.604
just as "communism" is going away.

00:04:25.604 --> 00:04:27.324
And with these graphics
I was really interested

00:04:27.324 --> 00:04:28.989
in the aesthetic of the graphs.

00:04:28.989 --> 00:04:30.858
So, this is Iran and Iraq, it reads

00:04:30.858 --> 00:04:34.361
like a clock, it's called
the "timepiece graph"

00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:36.124
And this is another timepiece graph

00:04:36.124 --> 00:04:40.377
overlaying despair, I think, over hope

00:04:40.377 --> 00:04:42.663
and there's only three times
-- that's it, crisis

00:04:42.687 --> 00:04:45.044
over hope --
There's only three times when crisis

00:04:45.044 --> 00:04:47.425
eclipses hope. We
are in the middle of one of them

00:04:47.425 --> 00:04:50.101
right now -- but don't
think about that too much.

00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:52.543
(Laughter)

00:04:52.543 --> 00:04:55.004
And finally the culmination of this work

00:04:55.004 --> 00:04:57.147
with the New York Times'
data a few years ago

00:04:57.171 --> 00:04:59.571
was the attempt to combine
an entire year's

00:04:59.571 --> 00:05:01.708
news cycle into a single graphic.

00:05:01.708 --> 00:05:04.448
So these graphics actually
show us a full year

00:05:04.448 --> 00:05:06.991
of news, all the people,
and how they are connected

00:05:06.991 --> 00:05:09.230
into a single graphic. And, from there

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.116
I started to be interested again

00:05:11.116 --> 00:05:13.838
in more active systems.
So, here's a project

00:05:13.838 --> 00:05:16.222
called "Just landed" where
I'm looking at people

00:05:16.222 --> 00:05:19.487
tweeting on Twitter "Hey!
I just landed in Hawaii!"

00:05:19.487 --> 00:05:21.948
You know how people just
casually try to sneak that

00:05:21.948 --> 00:05:24.841
into their twitter conversation.
"I'm not showing off!

00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:26.906
Really! But I did just land in Hawaii."

00:05:26.906 --> 00:05:29.756
And then I'm plotting those people's trips

00:05:29.756 --> 00:05:32.992
in the hopes that maybe
we can use social network

00:05:32.992 --> 00:05:34.724
and the data that it leaves behind

00:05:34.724 --> 00:05:36.842
to provide a model of how people move

00:05:36.842 --> 00:05:39.102
which would be valuable to epidemiologists

00:05:39.102 --> 00:05:40.827
among other people. And, more fun --

00:05:40.827 --> 00:05:43.101
this is a similar project
looking at people

00:05:43.101 --> 00:05:44.816
saying "Good morning!" to each other

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.787
all around the world. Which taught me

00:05:46.787 --> 00:05:48.645
by the way, that it is true that people

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.074
in Vancouver on the West Coast wake up

00:05:51.074 --> 00:05:53.184
much later and say "good
morning" much later

00:05:53.184 --> 00:05:55.376
than the people on the East Coast

00:05:55.376 --> 00:05:57.391
who are more adventurous.

00:05:57.391 --> 00:05:59.463
Here's a more useful -- maybe -- project

00:05:59.463 --> 00:06:01.084
where I took all the information

00:06:01.084 --> 00:06:03.555
from the Kepler project and try to put it

00:06:03.555 --> 00:06:05.707
into some visual form
that made sense to me.

00:06:05.707 --> 00:06:07.693
And I should say
that everything I've shown you

00:06:07.693 --> 00:06:09.384
up to now -- these are all things

00:06:09.384 --> 00:06:11.435
that I just did for fun. It may seem weird

00:06:11.435 --> 00:06:13.674
but this comes back from Hypercard.

00:06:13.674 --> 00:06:15.528
I'm building tools for myself.

00:06:15.528 --> 00:06:17.433
I may share them with a few other people

00:06:17.457 --> 00:06:19.979
but they are for fun, they are for me.

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.538
So all these tools I showed you

00:06:23.538 --> 00:06:26.061
that kind of occupy this weird space --

00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:28.906
somewhere between science, art and design

00:06:28.906 --> 00:06:30.592
and that's where my practice lies.

00:06:30.592 --> 00:06:33.560
And still today
from my experience with Hypercard

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.834
what I'm doing is I'm
building visual tools

00:06:35.834 --> 00:06:38.943
to help me understand systems.

00:06:38.943 --> 00:06:41.285
So today I work at the New York Times --

00:06:41.285 --> 00:06:43.788
I'm the data artist
in residence at the NY Times --

00:06:43.788 --> 00:06:45.745
and I've had the opportunity at the Times

00:06:45.745 --> 00:06:48.174
to work on a variety of really
interesting projects,

00:06:48.198 --> 00:06:50.394
two of which I'm going
to share with you today.

00:06:50.394 --> 00:06:52.775
The first one I've been working
on, in conjunction

00:06:52.799 --> 00:06:55.175
with Mark Hansen. Mark
Hansen is a professor

00:06:55.175 --> 00:06:59.168
of statistics at the UCLA.
He's also a media artist.

00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:01.978
And Mark came to the Times
with a very interesting question

00:07:02.002 --> 00:07:04.662
to what may seem
like an obvious problem --

00:07:04.662 --> 00:07:08.161
When people share content
on the Internet, how does

00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:12.218
that content get
from person A to person B?

00:07:12.218 --> 00:07:16.252
Or, maybe person A to person B to person C

00:07:16.252 --> 00:07:18.636
to person D. We know
that people share content

00:07:18.636 --> 00:07:20.494
in the Internet, but what we don't know

00:07:20.518 --> 00:07:21.821
is what happens in that gap

00:07:21.821 --> 00:07:23.736
between one person to the other.

00:07:23.736 --> 00:07:25.979
So we decided to build
the tool to explore that

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:28.091
and this tool is called 'cascade'.

00:07:28.091 --> 00:07:31.672
So if we look at these systems that start

00:07:31.672 --> 00:07:35.404
with one event that leads to other events.

00:07:35.404 --> 00:07:37.781
We call that structural cascade.

00:07:37.781 --> 00:07:40.099
And these cascades
actually happen over time

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:42.090
so we can model these things over time.

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.628
Now, the New York Times
has a lot of people

00:07:44.628 --> 00:07:47.328
who share our contents, so the cascades

00:07:47.328 --> 00:07:49.900
do not look like that one,
they look more like this --

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.653
So here is the typical cascade.

00:07:51.653 --> 00:07:55.216
At the bottom left, the very first event.

00:07:55.216 --> 00:07:57.910
And then as people are sharing the content

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.155
from one person to another we go up

00:08:00.155 --> 00:08:03.211
in the Y axis - degrees of separation -

00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:06.003
and over on the X axis for time.

00:08:06.003 --> 00:08:07.538
So we are able to look
at that conversation

00:08:07.538 --> 00:08:09.343
in a couple different views. This one

00:08:09.343 --> 00:08:12.262
which shows us the threads
of conversation.

00:08:12.262 --> 00:08:15.078
And this one which combines
that stacked view

00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:18.876
with a view that lets us see the threads.

00:08:18.876 --> 00:08:21.715
Now the Times publishes
about seven thousand pieces

00:08:21.715 --> 00:08:24.353
of content every month. So
it was important for us,

00:08:24.353 --> 00:08:25.835
when we were building this tool

00:08:25.835 --> 00:08:27.910
to make it an exploratory one.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.184
So the people could dig
through this vast terrain

00:08:31.184 --> 00:08:33.241
of data -- I think of it as a vehicle

00:08:33.241 --> 00:08:35.452
that we are giving people to traverse

00:08:35.452 --> 00:08:37.984
this really big terrain of data.

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:39.764
So here is what it really looks like

00:08:39.764 --> 00:08:42.424
and here is a cascade
playing in real time.

00:08:42.424 --> 00:08:44.725
I have to say, this
was a tremendous moment.

00:08:44.725 --> 00:08:48.048
We had been working
with canned data, fake data

00:08:48.048 --> 00:08:50.071
for so long, that when we saw this

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:53.675
for the first moment, it
was like an archaeologist

00:08:53.675 --> 00:08:56.479
who had just dusted
off these dinosaur bones.

00:08:56.479 --> 00:08:58.203
And we discovered this thing

00:08:58.203 --> 00:09:00.514
and we were seeing it for the first time.

00:09:00.514 --> 00:09:04.998
These sharing structures
that underlie the Internet.

00:09:04.998 --> 00:09:07.418
And maybe the dinosaur
analogy is a good one

00:09:07.418 --> 00:09:10.045
because we are actually
making some probabilistic

00:09:10.045 --> 00:09:11.760
guesses about how these things link.

00:09:11.784 --> 00:09:14.082
So we are looking at some of these pieces

00:09:14.082 --> 00:09:16.399
and making some guesses
but we try to make sure

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:19.367
that those are as statistically
rigorous as possible.

00:09:19.367 --> 00:09:22.959
Now, tweets in this case, they become

00:09:22.959 --> 00:09:26.132
parts of stories, they become
parts of narratives.

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:28.955
So we are building histories
here, but they are

00:09:28.955 --> 00:09:31.309
very short term histories. And sometimes

00:09:31.309 --> 00:09:33.553
these very large cascades are the most

00:09:33.553 --> 00:09:36.320
interesting ones,
but sometimes the small ones

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.266
are also interesting. This
is one of my favourites

00:09:39.266 --> 00:09:41.560
- we call this "The Rabbi Cascade."

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.515
It's a conversation
amongst rabbis about this article

00:09:45.515 --> 00:09:48.220
in the New York Times
about the fact that religious

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.570
workers don't get a lot of time off.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.570
I guess Saturdays and Sundays are bad days

00:09:52.594 --> 00:09:54.396
for them to take off.

00:09:54.396 --> 00:09:57.098
So in this cascade there
is a group of rabbis

00:09:57.098 --> 00:09:59.575
having a conversation
about a New York Times' story.

00:09:59.575 --> 00:10:01.718
One of them has the best
Twitter name ever --

00:10:01.742 --> 00:10:03.668
he's called the 'VelveteenRabbi'.

00:10:03.668 --> 00:10:05.913
(Laughter)

00:10:05.913 --> 00:10:08.056
But we wouldn't ever
found this if it weren't

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.615
for this exploratory tool.

00:10:10.615 --> 00:10:12.330
This would just be sitting somewhere

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.521
and we would have never
been able to see that.

00:10:14.545 --> 00:10:17.439
But this exercise of taking single pieces

00:10:17.439 --> 00:10:20.386
of information and building
narrative structures,

00:10:20.386 --> 00:10:22.682
building histories out of them,

00:10:22.682 --> 00:10:25.277
I find it tremendously interesting.

00:10:25.277 --> 00:10:27.437
Now, I moved to New York
about two years ago.

00:10:27.437 --> 00:10:30.081
And in New York everybody has a story

00:10:30.081 --> 00:10:33.275
that surrounds this
tremendously impactful event

00:10:33.275 --> 00:10:36.233
that happened on September 11th of 2001.

00:10:36.233 --> 00:10:38.755
And my own story with September 11th

00:10:38.755 --> 00:10:42.624
has really become a more intricate one

00:10:42.624 --> 00:10:45.075
because I spent a great
deal of time working

00:10:45.075 --> 00:10:49.390
on a piece of the 9/11
memorial in Manhattan.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:52.183
So the central idea
about the 9/11 memorial

00:10:52.183 --> 00:10:55.128
is that the names in the memorial
are not laid out

00:10:55.128 --> 00:10:57.933
in alphabetical order,
or chronological order,

00:10:57.933 --> 00:11:00.092
but instead they are laid out in a way

00:11:00.092 --> 00:11:02.527
in which the relationships
between the people

00:11:02.527 --> 00:11:06.082
who were killed are embodied
in the memorial.

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:08.575
Brothers are placed next to brothers,

00:11:08.575 --> 00:11:12.037
coworkers are placed together.
So, this memorial

00:11:12.037 --> 00:11:15.473
actually considers all of these
myriad connections

00:11:15.473 --> 00:11:18.929
that were part of these people's lives.

00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:22.627
So I work with a company
called Local Projects

00:11:22.627 --> 00:11:25.193
to work on an algorithm
and a software tool

00:11:25.193 --> 00:11:28.951
to help the architects build
the layout for the memorial.

00:11:28.951 --> 00:11:31.097
Almost three thousand names,

00:11:31.097 --> 00:11:34.588
and almost fifteen hundred of these
adjacency requests,

00:11:34.588 --> 00:11:38.175
these requests for connections.
So a very dense story,

00:11:38.175 --> 00:11:40.140
a very dense narrative that becomes

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.055
an embodied part of this memorial.

00:11:43.055 --> 00:11:45.376
So I'm working with Jake
Barton, we produce

00:11:45.376 --> 00:11:47.817
the software tool,
which allows the architects

00:11:47.817 --> 00:11:51.413
to, first of all, generate
the layout that satisfied

00:11:51.413 --> 00:11:54.470
all of those adjacency
requests, but then second

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.601
make little adjustments
where they needed to

00:11:56.601 --> 00:12:00.080
to tell the stories
that they wanted to tell.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.133
So this memorial, I think,

00:12:02.133 --> 00:12:05.193
has an incredibly timely
concept in our era

00:12:05.193 --> 00:12:08.262
of social networks,
because these networks --

00:12:08.262 --> 00:12:11.318
these real-life networks
that make people's lives

00:12:11.318 --> 00:12:14.443
are actually embodied
inside of the memorial.

00:12:14.443 --> 00:12:17.849
And one of the most tremendously
moving experiences

00:12:17.849 --> 00:12:21.173
it's to go to the memorial
and see how these people

00:12:21.173 --> 00:12:23.738
are placed next to each other,

00:12:23.738 --> 00:12:27.894
so that this memorial
is representing their own lives.

00:12:27.894 --> 00:12:30.201
How does this effect our lives?

00:12:30.201 --> 00:12:32.106
Well, I don't know if you remember, but,

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.116
in the spring, there was a controversy,

00:12:34.116 --> 00:12:36.617
because it was discovered
that, on the iPhone,

00:12:36.617 --> 00:12:38.382
and actually on your computer,

00:12:38.382 --> 00:12:40.300
you were storing a tremendous amount

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.122
of location data. So,
Apple responded saying,

00:12:44.122 --> 00:12:46.029
this was not location data about you,

00:12:46.029 --> 00:12:48.747
it was location data
about wireless networks

00:12:48.747 --> 00:12:50.956
that were in the area where you are.

00:12:50.956 --> 00:12:54.396
So it's not about you,
it's about where you are.

00:12:54.396 --> 00:12:58.561
(Laughter) This is very valuable data!

00:12:58.561 --> 00:13:01.999
It's like gold to researchers!
This mobility data --

00:13:01.999 --> 00:13:04.278
human mobility data. So what we thought --

00:13:04.278 --> 00:13:07.099
we thought, "Man! How
many people have iPhones?"

00:13:07.099 --> 00:13:09.099
How many of you have iPhones?

00:13:09.099 --> 00:13:13.850
So in this room we have
this tremendous database

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:18.919
of location data that researchers
would really really like.

00:13:18.919 --> 00:13:21.134
So we built this system called Open Paths,

00:13:21.134 --> 00:13:23.567
which lets people upload their iPhone data

00:13:23.567 --> 00:13:26.446
and broker relationships with researchers

00:13:26.446 --> 00:13:28.632
to share that data, to donate that data

00:13:28.632 --> 00:13:31.294
to people that can actually put it to use.

00:13:31.294 --> 00:13:33.700
So Open Paths was a great
success as a prototype.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.281
We received thousands
of datasets, and we built

00:13:37.281 --> 00:13:39.795
this interface which allows
people to actually

00:13:39.795 --> 00:13:42.578
see their lives unfolding from this traces

00:13:42.578 --> 00:13:45.602
that are left behind on your devices.

00:13:45.602 --> 00:13:48.859
Now, what we didn't expect was how moving

00:13:48.859 --> 00:13:51.778
this experience would be.
When I uploaded my data

00:13:51.778 --> 00:13:53.778
I thought, "Big deal. I know where I live.

00:13:53.802 --> 00:13:56.668
I know where I work. What
am I going to see here?"

00:13:56.668 --> 00:13:58.417
Well it turns out what I saw was

00:13:58.417 --> 00:14:00.098
that moment I got off the plane

00:14:00.098 --> 00:14:02.602
to start my new life in New York.

00:14:02.602 --> 00:14:04.317
The restaurant where I had Thai food

00:14:04.317 --> 00:14:05.846
that first night, thinking about

00:14:05.846 --> 00:14:08.166
this new experience of being in New York.

00:14:08.166 --> 00:14:11.662
The day that I met my girlfriend.

00:14:11.662 --> 00:14:15.432
This is LaGuardia airport.

00:14:15.432 --> 00:14:19.667
This is this Thai restaurant
on Amsterdam Avenue.

00:14:19.667 --> 00:14:23.006
This is the moment I met my girlfriend.

00:14:23.006 --> 00:14:24.712
See how that changes the first time

00:14:24.712 --> 00:14:26.603
I told you about those stories,

00:14:26.603 --> 00:14:29.032
and the second time I told
you about those stories.

00:14:29.056 --> 00:14:32.370
Because what we do in the tool
inadvertently is --

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.830
we put these pieces of data
into a human context.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.380
And by placing data into a human context

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.510
it gains meaning. And I think
this is tremendously

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:44.370
tremendously important. Because these are

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:49.606
our histories that are being
stored on these devices.

00:14:49.606 --> 00:14:52.451
And by thinking about them that way,

00:14:52.451 --> 00:14:54.590
putting them in a human context --

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.966
first of all what we do with our own data

00:14:56.966 --> 00:14:58.486
is get a better understanding of the type

00:14:58.486 --> 00:15:00.592
of information that we are sharing.

00:15:00.592 --> 00:15:02.926
But if we can do this
with other data, we can put

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.575
data into a human context,
I think we can change

00:15:05.575 --> 00:15:10.400
a lot of things. Because,
it builds automatically

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.486
empathy for the people
involved in these systems.

00:15:14.486 --> 00:15:17.885
And that in turn results
in a fundamental respect which

00:15:17.885 --> 00:15:21.412
I believe is missing
in a large part of technology.

00:15:21.412 --> 00:15:25.585
And we start to deal
with issues like privacy.

00:15:25.585 --> 00:15:27.424
By understanding that these numbers

00:15:27.424 --> 00:15:29.853
are not just numbers,
but instead they are attached

00:15:29.853 --> 00:15:32.330
- they are tethered to pieces
of the real world.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:34.709
They carry weight. By understanding that

00:15:34.709 --> 00:15:38.503
the dialog becomes a lot different.

00:15:38.503 --> 00:15:40.810
How many of you have ever clicked a button

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.911
that enables a third party to access

00:15:43.911 --> 00:15:46.455
your location data on your phone?

00:15:46.455 --> 00:15:48.034
Many people. Lots of you.

00:15:48.034 --> 00:15:50.408
So the third party is the developer,

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:53.107
the second party is Apple --

00:15:53.107 --> 00:15:54.896
the only party that never gets access

00:15:54.896 --> 00:15:58.875
to this information is the first party!

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:01.687
And I think that's because we think
about these pieces

00:16:01.687 --> 00:16:04.296
of data in a strandred abstract way.

00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:06.964
We don't put them
into a context which I think

00:16:06.964 --> 00:16:08.489
makes them a lot more important.

00:16:08.489 --> 00:16:10.680
So what I'm asking you
to do is really simple.

00:16:10.704 --> 00:16:13.778
Start to think about data
in a human context.

00:16:13.778 --> 00:16:16.049
Doesn't really take anything.
When you read

00:16:16.049 --> 00:16:18.919
stock prices, think about them
in a human context.

00:16:18.919 --> 00:16:20.729
When you think about mortgage reports,

00:16:20.753 --> 00:16:22.556
think about them in a human context.

00:16:22.556 --> 00:16:26.362
There's no doubt that big
data is big business.

00:16:26.362 --> 00:16:30.335
There's an industry being developed here.

00:16:30.335 --> 00:16:32.019
Think about how well we have done

00:16:32.019 --> 00:16:34.162
in previous industries
that we have developed

00:16:34.186 --> 00:16:36.540
involving resources --
not very well at all.

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.017
And I think part of that problem
is that we have had

00:16:39.041 --> 00:16:41.129
a lack of participation in these dialogues

00:16:41.129 --> 00:16:45.620
from multiple pieces of human society.

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.590
So the other thing that I'm asking for

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.182
is an inclusion in this
dialogue from artists,

00:16:51.182 --> 00:16:53.402
from poets, from writers -- from people

00:16:53.402 --> 00:16:57.585
who can bring a human element
into this discussion.

00:16:57.585 --> 00:17:00.075
Because I believe that this world of data

00:17:00.075 --> 00:17:03.601
is going to be transformative for us.

00:17:03.601 --> 00:17:06.740
And unlike our attempts
with the resource industry

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:09.084
and our attempts
with the financial industry,

00:17:09.084 --> 00:17:11.962
by bringing the human
element into this story

00:17:11.962 --> 00:17:15.182
I think that we can take
it to tremendous places.

00:17:15.182 --> 00:17:16.402
Thank you.

00:17:16.402 --> 00:17:20.294
(Applause)
