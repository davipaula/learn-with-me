00:00:06.194 --> 00:00:09.257
Your Brain on Food

00:00:09.257 --> 00:00:12.859
If you sucked all of the moisture
out of your brain

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:16.390
and broke it down to its constituent
nutritional content,

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.112
what would it look like?

00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:22.199
Most of the weight of your dehydrated 
brain would come from fats,

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.816
also known as lipids.

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:28.855
In the remaining brain matter,
you would find proteins and amino acids,

00:00:28.855 --> 00:00:30.787
traces of micronutrients,

00:00:30.787 --> 00:00:32.973
and glucose.

00:00:32.973 --> 00:00:37.392
The brain is, of course, more than
just the sum of its nutritional parts,

00:00:37.392 --> 00:00:41.359
but each component does have
a distinct impact on functioning,

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:42.367
development,

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:43.232
mood,

00:00:43.232 --> 00:00:44.940
and energy.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.726
So that post-lunch apathy,

00:00:46.726 --> 00:00:49.548
or late-night alertness
you might be feeling,

00:00:49.548 --> 00:00:54.506
well, that could simply be the effects
of food on your brain.

00:00:54.506 --> 00:00:59.758
Of the fats in your brain,
the superstars are omegas 3 and 6.

00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:01.600
These essential fatty acids,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.045
which have been linked to preventing
degenerative brain conditions,

00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:07.256
must come from our diets.

00:01:07.256 --> 00:01:09.005
So eating omega-rich foods,

00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:09.827
like nuts,

00:01:09.827 --> 00:01:10.651
seeds,

00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:11.944
and fatty fish,

00:01:11.944 --> 00:01:16.755
is crucial to the creation and maintenance
of cell membranes.

00:01:16.755 --> 00:01:19.320
And while omegas are good fats
for your brain,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.918
long-term consumption of other fats,
like trans and saturated fats,

00:01:23.918 --> 00:01:26.601
may compromise brain health.

00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:29.291
Meanwhile, proteins and amino acids,

00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:32.349
the building block nutrients of growth
and development,

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:35.819
manipulate how we feel and behave.

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.976
Amino acids contain the precursors
to neurotransmitters,

00:01:39.976 --> 00:01:43.799
the chemical messengers that carry
signals between neurons,

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.324
affecting things like mood,

00:01:45.324 --> 00:01:46.230
sleep,

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.290
attentiveness,

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.072
and weight.

00:01:49.072 --> 00:01:53.515
They're one of the reasons we might feel
calm after eating a large plate of pasta,

00:01:53.515 --> 00:01:56.855
or more alert after a protein-rich meal.

00:01:56.855 --> 00:01:59.958
The complex combinations 
of compounds in food

00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:04.754
can stimulate brain cells to release
mood-altering norepinephrine,

00:02:04.754 --> 00:02:06.101
dopamine,

00:02:06.101 --> 00:02:07.723
and serotonin.

00:02:07.723 --> 00:02:09.755
But getting to your brain cells is tricky,

00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:13.264
and amino acids have to compete
for limited access.

00:02:13.264 --> 00:02:17.412
A diet with a range of foods helps 
maintain a balanced combination

00:02:17.412 --> 00:02:19.287
of brain messengers,

00:02:19.287 --> 00:02:23.633
and keeps your mood from getting skewed
in one direction or the other.

00:02:23.633 --> 00:02:25.535
Like the other organs in our bodies,

00:02:25.535 --> 00:02:30.151
our brains also benefit from a steady
supply of micronutrients.

00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:32.320
Antioxidants in fruits and vegetables

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.326
strengthen the brain to fight off
free radicals that destroy brain cells,

00:02:37.326 --> 00:02:41.223
enabling your brain to work well
for a longer period of time.

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:43.298
And without powerful micronutrients,

00:02:43.298 --> 00:02:44.602
like the vitamins B6,

00:02:44.602 --> 00:02:45.764
B12,

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:47.257
and folic acid,

00:02:47.257 --> 00:02:51.869
our brains would be susceptible 
to brain disease and mental decline.

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:53.633
Trace amounts of the minerals iron,

00:02:53.633 --> 00:02:54.462
copper,

00:02:54.462 --> 00:02:55.288
zinc,

00:02:55.288 --> 00:02:56.288
and sodium

00:02:56.288 --> 00:03:01.191
are also fundamental to brain health
and early cognitive development.

00:03:01.191 --> 00:03:04.567
In order for the brain to efficiently
transform and synthesize

00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:06.101
these valuable nutrients,

00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:08.441
it needs fuel, and lots of it.

00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:12.881
While the human brain only
makes up about 2% of our body weight,

00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:16.646
it uses up to 20% of our energy resources.

00:03:16.646 --> 00:03:19.691
Most of this energy comes 
from carbohydrates

00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:24.106
that our body digests into glucose,
or blood sugar.

00:03:24.106 --> 00:03:28.004
The frontal lobes are so sensitive
to drops in glucose, in fact,

00:03:28.004 --> 00:03:31.786
that a change in mental function
is one of the primary signals

00:03:31.786 --> 00:03:34.754
of nutrient deficiency.

00:03:34.754 --> 00:03:37.101
Assuming that we are getting
glucose regularly,

00:03:37.101 --> 00:03:42.136
how does the specific type 
of carbohydrates we eat affect our brains?

00:03:42.136 --> 00:03:44.225
Carbs come in three forms:

00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:44.985
starch,

00:03:44.985 --> 00:03:45.759
sugar,

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:47.191
and fiber.

00:03:47.191 --> 00:03:48.856
While on most nutrition labels,

00:03:48.856 --> 00:03:52.135
they are all lumped 
into one total carb count,

00:03:52.135 --> 00:03:56.172
the ratio of the sugar and fiber subgroups
to the whole amount

00:03:56.172 --> 00:03:59.382
affect how the body and brain respond.

00:03:59.382 --> 00:04:02.135
A high glycemic food, like white bread,

00:04:02.135 --> 00:04:05.639
causes a rapid release of glucose
into the blood,

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.915
and then comes the dip.

00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:12.473
Blood sugar shoots down,
and with it, our attention span and mood.

00:04:12.473 --> 00:04:17.941
On the other hand, oats, grains,
and legumes have slower glucose release,

00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:21.288
enabling a steadier level 
of attentiveness.

00:04:21.288 --> 00:04:23.035
For sustained brain power,

00:04:23.035 --> 00:04:27.199
opting for a varied diet of nutrient-rich
foods is critical.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.980
When it comes to what you bite,
chew, and swallow,

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.537
your choices have a direct
and long-lasting effect

00:04:33.537 --> 00:04:35.977
on the most powerful organ in your body.
