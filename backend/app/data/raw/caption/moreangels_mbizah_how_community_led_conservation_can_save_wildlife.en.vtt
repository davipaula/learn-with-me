00:00:13.317 --> 00:00:15.285
I'm a lion conservationist.

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.166
Sounds cool, doesn't it?

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.381
Some people may have no idea
what that means.

00:00:20.405 --> 00:00:23.414
But I'm sure you've all heard
about Cecil the lion.

00:00:23.438 --> 00:00:24.983
[Cecil the Lion (2002-2015)]

00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:29.996
(Lion roaring)

00:00:31.744 --> 00:00:34.020
He roars no more.

00:00:34.044 --> 00:00:36.672
On the second of July, 2015,

00:00:36.696 --> 00:00:40.115
his life was cut short
when he was killed by a trophy hunter.

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:44.413
They say that you can become attached
to the animals you study.

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:47.641
That was the case for me
with Cecil the lion,

00:00:47.665 --> 00:00:49.966
having known him and studied him
for three years

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.531
in Hwange National Park.

00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:54.477
I was heartbroken at his death.

00:00:56.061 --> 00:00:58.586
But the good thing
to come out of this tragedy

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.879
is the attention that the story brought

00:01:00.903 --> 00:01:04.077
towards the plight
of threatened wild animals.

00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:06.196
After Cecil's death,

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.022
I began to ask myself these questions:

00:01:09.046 --> 00:01:13.033
What if the community
that lived next to Cecil the lion

00:01:13.057 --> 00:01:15.123
was involved in protecting him?

00:01:15.572 --> 00:01:21.045
What if I had met Cecil
when I was 10 years old, instead of 29?

00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:24.446
Could I or my classmates
have changed his fate?

00:01:25.212 --> 00:01:28.926
Many people are working
to stop lions from disappearing,

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.617
but very few of these people
are native to these countries

00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:35.174
or from the communities most affected.

00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:38.046
But the communities
that live with the lions

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.743
are the ones best positioned
to help lions the most.

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:44.601
Local people should be at the forefront

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:48.188
of the solutions to the challenges
facing their wildlife.

00:01:48.212 --> 00:01:50.307
Sometimes, change can only come

00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:54.513
when the people most affected
and impacted take charge.

00:01:54.537 --> 00:01:56.735
Local communities play an important role

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.941
in fighting poaching
and illegal wildlife trade,

00:01:59.965 --> 00:02:03.682
which are major threats
affecting lions and other wildlife.

00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:07.220
Being a black African woman
in the sciences,

00:02:07.244 --> 00:02:09.802
the people I meet
are always curious to know

00:02:09.826 --> 00:02:12.466
if I've always wanted
to be a conservationist,

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.799
because they don't meet
a lot of conservationists

00:02:14.823 --> 00:02:16.204
who look like me.

00:02:16.228 --> 00:02:17.379
When I was growing up,

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:20.469
I didn't even know that wildlife
conservation was a career.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.014
The first time I saw a wild animal
in my home country

00:02:24.038 --> 00:02:26.664
was when I was 25 years old,

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:29.141
even though lions and African wild dogs

00:02:29.165 --> 00:02:32.030
lived just a few miles away from my home.

00:02:32.815 --> 00:02:35.141
This is quite common in Zimbabwe,

00:02:35.165 --> 00:02:37.831
as many people
are not exposed to wildlife,

00:02:37.855 --> 00:02:40.509
even though it's part of our heritage.

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:42.072
When I was growing up,

00:02:42.096 --> 00:02:46.064
I didn't even know
that lions lived in my backyard.

00:02:46.088 --> 00:02:48.818
When I stepped into
SavÃ© Valley Conservancy

00:02:48.842 --> 00:02:51.910
on a cold winter morning 10 years ago

00:02:51.934 --> 00:02:56.118
to study African wild dogs
for my master's research project,

00:02:56.142 --> 00:03:00.233
I was mesmerized by the beauty
and the tranquility that surrounded me.

00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:04.377
I felt like I had found my passion
and my purpose in life.

00:03:04.401 --> 00:03:06.337
I made a commitment that day

00:03:06.361 --> 00:03:09.718
that I was going to dedicate my life
to protecting animals.

00:03:09.742 --> 00:03:12.615
I think of my childhood
school days in Zimbabwe

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.085
and the other kids I was in school with.

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.315
Perhaps if we had a chance
to interact with wildlife,

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:22.589
more of my classmates
would be working alongside me now.

00:03:23.458 --> 00:03:28.339
Unless the local communities
want to protect and coexist with wildlife,

00:03:28.363 --> 00:03:31.096
all conservation efforts might be in vain.

00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:34.593
These are the communities
that live with the wild animals

00:03:34.617 --> 00:03:36.252
in the same ecosystem

00:03:36.276 --> 00:03:38.477
and bear the cost of doing so.

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.387
If they don't have a direct connection

00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:43.577
or benefit from the animals,

00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:46.150
they have no reason
to want to protect them.

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:49.760
And if local communities
don't protect their wildlife,

00:03:49.784 --> 00:03:52.784
no amount of outside
intervention will work.

00:03:53.728 --> 00:03:55.910
So what needs to be done?

00:03:56.688 --> 00:04:00.149
Conservationists must prioritize
environmental education

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:04.004
and help expand the community's skills
to conserve their wildlife.

00:04:04.426 --> 00:04:08.077
Schoolchildren and communities
must be taken to national parks,

00:04:08.101 --> 00:04:11.252
so they get a chance
to connect with the wildlife.

00:04:11.776 --> 00:04:14.458
At every effort and every level,

00:04:14.482 --> 00:04:17.475
conservation must include
the economies of the people

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:20.233
who share the land with the wild animals.

00:04:20.872 --> 00:04:23.999
It is also critical
that local conservationists

00:04:24.023 --> 00:04:27.091
be part of every conservation effort,

00:04:27.115 --> 00:04:31.529
if we are to build trust and really embed
conservation into communities.

00:04:31.974 --> 00:04:35.460
As local conservationists,
we face many hurdles,

00:04:35.484 --> 00:04:39.831
from outright discrimination
to barriers because of cultural norms.

00:04:40.133 --> 00:04:42.498
But I will not give up my efforts

00:04:42.522 --> 00:04:45.065
to bring indigenous
communities to this fight

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:47.156
for the survival of our planet.

00:04:47.712 --> 00:04:50.759
I'm asking you to come
and stand together with me.

00:04:50.783 --> 00:04:54.244
We must actively dismantle
the hurdles we have created,

00:04:54.268 --> 00:04:58.450
which are leaving indigenous populations
out of conservation efforts.

00:04:58.474 --> 00:05:01.617
I've dedicated my life
to protecting lions.

00:05:01.641 --> 00:05:03.974
And I know my neighbor would, too,

00:05:03.998 --> 00:05:08.404
if only they knew the animals
that lived next door to them.

00:05:08.984 --> 00:05:10.158
Thank you.

00:05:10.182 --> 00:05:14.697
(Applause)
