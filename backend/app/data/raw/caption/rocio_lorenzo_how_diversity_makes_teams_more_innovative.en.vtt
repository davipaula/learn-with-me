00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.896
Fifteen years ago,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.760
I thought that the diversity stuff
was not something I had to worry about.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.720
It was something an older
generation had to fight for.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.656
In my university,
we were 50-50, male-female,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.456
and we women often had better grades.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.856
So while not everything was perfect,

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.896
diversity and leadership decisions

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.000
was something that would happen
naturally over time, right?

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.400
Well, not quite.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.056
While moving up the ladder
working as a management consultant

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.136
across Europe and the US,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.736
I started to realize how often
I was the only woman in the room

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.280
and how homogenous leadership still is.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.336
Many leaders I met

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.176
saw diversity as something to comply with
out of political correctness,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.840
or, best case, the right thing to do,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.680
but not as a business priority.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.656
They just did not have a reason to believe

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.656
that diversity would help them achieve
their most immediate, pressing goals:

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.736
hitting the numbers,
delivering the new product,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.040
the real goals they are measured by.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.856
My personal experience
working with diverse teams

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.976
had been that while they require
a little bit more effort at the beginning,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.200
they did bring fresher,
more creative ideas.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.016
So I wanted to know:

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.856
Are diverse organizations
really more innovative,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.720
and can diversity be more
than something to comply with?

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.680
Can it be a real competitive advantage?

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.640
So to find out, we set up a study
with the Technical University of Munich.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.576
We surveyed 171 companies
in Germany, Austria and Switzerland,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.536
and as we speak, we're expanding the study

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.376
to 1,600 companies

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.880
in five additional countries
around the world.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.656
We asked those companies
basically two things:

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.720
how innovative they are
and how diverse they are.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.336
To measure the first one,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.080
we asked them about innovation revenue.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.656
Innovation revenue is the share
of revenues they've made

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.696
from new products and services
in the last three years,

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.976
meaning we did not ask them
how many creative ideas they have,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.816
but rather if these ideas
translate into products and services

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.240
that really make the company
more successful today and tomorrow.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.296
To measure diversity,
we looked at six different factors:

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.880
country of origin,
age and gender, amongst others.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.256
While preparing to go in the field
with those questions,

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.536
I sat down with my team

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.840
and we discussed what
we would expect as a result.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.760
To put it mildly, we were not optimistic.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.536
The most skeptical person on the team
thought, or saw a real possibility,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.960
that we would find nothing at all.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.656
Most of the team
was rather on the cautious side,

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.576
so we landed all together at "only if,"

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.696
meaning that we might find
some kind of link

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.256
between innovation and diversity,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.936
but not across the board --

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.856
rather only if certain criteria are met,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.936
for example leadership style,
very open leadership style

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.120
that allowed people to speak up freely
and safely and contribute.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.280
A couple of months later,
the data came in,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.840
and the results convinced
the most skeptical amongst us.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.416
The answer was a clear yes,

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.200
no ifs, no buts.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.976
The data in our sample showed

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.480
that more diverse companies
are simply more innovative, period.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.136
Now, a fair question to ask
is the chicken or the egg question,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.576
meaning, are companies
really more innovative

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.256
because they have
a more diverse leadership,

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.536
or the other way around?

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.760
Which way is it?

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.040
Now, we do not know how much
is correlation versus causation,

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.856
but what we do know is that clearly,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.056
in our sample, companies
that are more diverse

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.576
are more innovative,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.896
and that companies
that are more innovative

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.760
have more diverse leadership, too.

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:33.016
So it's fair to assume
that it works both ways,

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.920
diversity driving innovation
and innovation driving diversity.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.136
Now, once we published the results,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.736
we were surprised
about the reactions in the media.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.656
We got quite some attention.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.176
And it went from quite factual,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.456
like "Higher Female Share
Boosts Innovation"

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.976
to a little bit more sensationalist.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.936
(Laughter)

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.176
As you can see,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.296
"Stay-at-home Women Cost Trillions,"

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.256
and, my personal favorite,

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.656
"Housewives Kill Innovation."

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.696
Well, there's no such thing
as bad publicity, right?

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.056
(Laughter)

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.056
On the back of that coverage,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.536
we started to get calls
from senior executives

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.256
wanting to understand more,

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.840
especially -- surprise, surprise --
about gender diversity.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.776
I tend to open up
those discussions by asking,

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.936
"Well, what do you think of the situation
in your organization today?"

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.520
And a frequent reaction to that is,

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.520
"Well, we're not yet there,
but we're not that bad."

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.416
One executive told me, for example,

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.976
"Oh, we're not that bad.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.736
We have one member
in our board who is a woman."

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.096
(Laughter)

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.336
And you laugh --

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.320
(Applause)

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.136
Now, you laugh, but he had a point
in being proud about it,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.496
because in Germany,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.496
if you have a company

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.096
and it has one member
on the board who is a woman,

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.536
you are part of a select group of 30

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.216
out of the 100 largest
publicly listed companies.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.456
The other 70 companies
have an all-male board,

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:24.296
and not even one of these hundred
largest publicly listed companies

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:28.000
have, as of today, a female CEO.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.320
But here's the critically
important insight.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.216
Those few female board members alone,

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.136
they won't make a difference.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:42.280
Our data shows that for gender diversity
to have an impact on innovation,

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.920
you need to have more
than 20 percent women in leadership.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.080
Let's have a look at the numbers.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.296
As you can see, we divided
the sample into three groups,

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.216
and the results are quite dramatic.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.936
Only in the group where you have
more than 20 percent women in leadership,

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.840
only then you see a clear jump
in innovation revenue

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.816
to above-average levels.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.496
So experience and data
shows that you do need critical mass

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.016
to move the needle,

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.376
and companies like Alibaba,
JP Morgan or Apple

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.760
have as of today
already achieved that threshold.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.880
Another reaction I got quite a lot was,

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.400
"Well, it will get solved over time."

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.456
And I have all the sympathy in the world
for that point of view,

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.400
because I used to think like that, too.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.896
Now, let's have a look here again
and look at the numbers,

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.056
taking Germany as an example.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.296
Let me first give you the good news.

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.136
So the share of women
who are college graduates

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.576
and have at least 10 years
of professional experience

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.896
has grown nicely over the last 20 years,

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.696
which means the pool
in which to fish for female leaders

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.856
has increased over time,

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.576
and that's great.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.440
Now, according to my old theory,

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.456
the share of women in leadership

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.800
would have grown
more or less in parallel, right?

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.720
Now, let's have a look
at what happened in reality.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.040
It's not even close,

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.576
which means I was so wrong

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.376
and which means that my generation,

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:26.600
your generation,

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.200
the best-educated
female generation in history,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.936
we have just not made it.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:38.456
We have failed to achieve leadership
in significant numbers.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.400
Education just did not
translate into leadership.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.816
Now, that was a painful realization for me

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.976
and made me realize,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.296
if we want to change this,

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.679
we need to engage,
and we need to do better.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.560
Now, what to do?

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.856
Achieving more than 20 percent
women in leadership

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.256
seems like a daunting task to many,

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.760
understandably, given the track record.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.296
But it's doable,

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.576
and there are many companies today
that are making progress there

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.216
and doing it successfully.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.696
Let's take SAP, the software
company, as an example.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.376
They had, in 2011,
19 percent women in leadership,

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.256
yet they decided to do better,

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.456
and they did what you do
in any other area of business

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.016
where you want to improve.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.520
They set themselves a measurable target.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.336
So they set themselves a target
of 25 percent for 2017,

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.960
which they have just achieved.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.536
The goals made them think more creatively
about developing leaders

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.016
and tapping new recruiting pools.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:49.400
They now even set a target of 30 percent
women in leadership for 2022.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.936
So experience shows it's doable,

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.936
and at the end of the day,

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.096
it all boils down to two decisions
that are taken every day

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.880
in every organization by many of us:

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.040
who to hire and who
to develop and promote.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.576
Now, nothing against women's programs,

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.936
networks, mentoring, trainings.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.160
All is good.

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.256
But it is these two decisions

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.296
that at the end of the day
send the most powerful change signal

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.840
in any organization.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.096
Now, I never set out
to be a diversity advocate.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.840
I am a business advisor.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.696
But now my goal is
to change the face of leadership,

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.160
to make it more diverse --

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.576
and not so that leaders can check a box

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.576
and feel like they have
complied with something

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.136
or they have been politically correct.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.856
But because they understand,

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.376
they understand that diversity
is making their organization

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.800
more innovative, better.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.536
And by embracing diversity,
by embracing diverse talent,

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.880
we are providing
true opportunity for everyone.
