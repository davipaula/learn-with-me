00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:16.961
Simone George: I met Mark
when he was just blind.

00:00:17.389 --> 00:00:19.389
I had returned home to live in Dublin

00:00:19.413 --> 00:00:22.815
after the odyssey that was my 20s,

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:27.156
educating my interest in human rights
and equality in university,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.380
traveling the world,
like my nomad grandmother.

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:34.514
And during a two-year stint
working in Madrid,

00:00:34.538 --> 00:00:38.283
dancing many nights
till morning in salsa clubs.

00:00:39.903 --> 00:00:42.887
When I met Mark, he asked me
to teach him to dance.

00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:44.338
And I did.

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:48.371
They were wonderful times,
long nights talking,

00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:51.728
becoming friends
and eventually falling for each other.

00:00:53.203 --> 00:00:55.918
Mark had lost his sight when he was 22,

00:00:55.942 --> 00:01:00.744
and the man that I met eight years later
was rebuilding his identity,

00:01:00.768 --> 00:01:04.717
the cornerstone of which
was this incredible spirit

00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:09.416
that had taken him to the Gobi Desert,
where he ran six marathons in seven days.

00:01:09.918 --> 00:01:14.113
And to marathons at the North Pole,
and from Everest Base Camp.

00:01:15.312 --> 00:01:19.019
When I asked him what had led
to this high-octane life,

00:01:19.043 --> 00:01:21.161
he quoted Nietzsche:

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:25.552
"He, who has a Why to live,
can bear with almost any How."

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.002
He had come across the quote
in a really beautiful book

00:01:30.026 --> 00:01:33.609
called "Man's Search for Meaning,"
by Viktor Frankl,

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:35.839
a neurologist and psychiatrist

00:01:35.863 --> 00:01:39.063
who survived years
in a Nazi concentration camp.

00:01:39.561 --> 00:01:43.792
Frankl used this Nietzsche quote
to explain to us

00:01:43.816 --> 00:01:47.180
that when we can no longer change
our circumstances,

00:01:47.204 --> 00:01:50.204
we are challenged to change ourselves.

00:01:52.188 --> 00:01:55.403
Mark Pollock: Eventually,
I did rebuild my identity,

00:01:55.427 --> 00:01:58.482
and the Why for me
was about competing again,

00:01:58.506 --> 00:02:02.125
because pursuing success
and risking failure

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.085
was simply how I felt normal.

00:02:05.957 --> 00:02:08.369
And I finished the rebuild

00:02:08.393 --> 00:02:11.327
on the 10th anniversary
of losing my sight.

00:02:11.861 --> 00:02:15.887
I took part in a 43-day expedition race

00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:20.282
in the coldest, most remote,
most challenging place on earth.

00:02:20.783 --> 00:02:22.842
It was the first race to the South Pole

00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:29.159
since Shackleton, Scott and Amundsen
set foot in Antarctica, 100 years before.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.963
And putting the demons
of blindness behind me

00:02:32.987 --> 00:02:35.770
with every step towards the pole,

00:02:35.794 --> 00:02:39.778
it offered me a long-lasting
sense of contentment.

00:02:41.736 --> 00:02:44.974
As it turned out,
I would need that in reserve,

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:49.101
because one year after my return,

00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:52.157
in, arguably, the safest place on earth,

00:02:52.181 --> 00:02:55.513
a bedroom at a friend's house,

00:02:55.537 --> 00:03:01.323
I fell from a third-story window
onto the concrete below.

00:03:02.164 --> 00:03:03.703
I don't know how it happened.

00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:06.688
I think I must have got up
to go to the bathroom.

00:03:07.005 --> 00:03:12.442
And because I'm blind,
I used to run my hand along the wall

00:03:12.466 --> 00:03:13.616
to find my way.

00:03:14.704 --> 00:03:20.502
That night, my hand found an open space
where the closed window should have been.

00:03:21.252 --> 00:03:22.719
And I cartwheeled out.

00:03:23.657 --> 00:03:26.029
My friends who found me
thought I was dead.

00:03:26.053 --> 00:03:29.903
When I got to hospital,
the doctors thought I was going to die,

00:03:29.927 --> 00:03:32.261
and when I realized
what was happening to me,

00:03:32.285 --> 00:03:35.714
I thought that dying might have been ...

00:03:37.157 --> 00:03:39.498
might have been the best outcome.

00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:42.624
And lying in intensive care,

00:03:42.648 --> 00:03:47.458
facing the prospect
of being blind and paralyzed,

00:03:47.482 --> 00:03:52.202
high on morphine, I was trying
to make sense of what was going on.

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:55.902
And one night, lying flat on my back,

00:03:55.926 --> 00:04:02.519
I felt for my phone to write a blog,

00:04:02.543 --> 00:04:04.903
trying to explain how I should respond.

00:04:04.927 --> 00:04:08.839
It was called "Optimist, Realist
or Something Else?"

00:04:08.863 --> 00:04:12.022
and it drew on the experiences
of Admiral Stockdale,

00:04:12.046 --> 00:04:14.588
who was a POW in the Vietnam war.

00:04:16.092 --> 00:04:20.997
He was incarcerated, tortured,
for over seven years.

00:04:21.021 --> 00:04:24.790
His circumstances were bleak,
but he survived.

00:04:25.513 --> 00:04:28.536
The ones who didn't survive
were the optimists.

00:04:29.084 --> 00:04:31.060
They said, "We'll be out by Christmas,"

00:04:31.084 --> 00:04:33.892
and Christmas would come
and Christmas would go,

00:04:33.916 --> 00:04:36.141
and then it would be Christmas again,

00:04:36.165 --> 00:04:41.570
and when they didn't get out,
they became disappointed, demoralized

00:04:41.594 --> 00:04:44.569
and many of them died in their cells.

00:04:46.323 --> 00:04:49.132
Stockdale was a realist.

00:04:49.474 --> 00:04:52.780
He was inspired by the stoic philosophers,

00:04:52.804 --> 00:04:59.260
and he confronted the brutal
facts of his circumstances

00:04:59.284 --> 00:05:03.369
while maintaining a faith
that he would prevail in the end.

00:05:04.053 --> 00:05:08.041
And in that blog, I was trying to apply
his thinking as a realist

00:05:08.065 --> 00:05:10.665
to my increasingly bleak circumstances.

00:05:11.609 --> 00:05:15.053
During the many months
of heart infections and kidney infections

00:05:15.077 --> 00:05:19.147
after my fall, at the very
edge of survival,

00:05:20.172 --> 00:05:24.386
Simone and I faced
the fundamental question:

00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:30.804
How do you resolve the tension
between acceptance and hope?

00:05:30.828 --> 00:05:33.867
And it's that that we want
to explore with you now.

00:05:35.228 --> 00:05:38.395
SG: After I got the call,
I caught the first flight to England

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.228
and arrived into the brightly lit
intensive care ward,

00:05:42.252 --> 00:05:45.537
where Mark was lying naked,
just under a sheet,

00:05:45.561 --> 00:05:49.447
connected to machines
that were monitoring if he would live.

00:05:50.085 --> 00:05:52.624
I said, "I'm here, Mark."

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.453
And he cried tears he seemed
to have saved just for me.

00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:03.044
I wanted to gather him in my arms,
but I couldn't move him,

00:06:03.068 --> 00:06:07.163
and so I kissed him
the way you kiss a newborn baby,

00:06:07.187 --> 00:06:09.178
terrified of their fragility.

00:06:10.673 --> 00:06:14.839
Later that afternoon, when the bad news
had been laid out for us --

00:06:14.863 --> 00:06:19.156
fractured skull, bleeds on his brain,
a possible torn aorta

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:25.188
and a spine broken in two places,
no movement or feeling below his waist --

00:06:25.212 --> 00:06:28.180
Mark said to me, "Come here.

00:06:29.109 --> 00:06:33.702
You need to get yourself
as far away from this as possible."

00:06:35.577 --> 00:06:38.276
As I tried to process what he was saying,

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.815
I was thinking, "What the hell
is wrong with you?"

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:43.553
(Laughter)

00:06:43.577 --> 00:06:45.171
"We can't do this now."

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.014
So I asked him,
"Are you breaking up with me?"

00:06:49.038 --> 00:06:52.554
(Laughter)

00:06:52.578 --> 00:06:57.236
And he said, "Look, you signed up
for the blindness, but not this."

00:06:58.477 --> 00:07:01.318
And I answered,
"We don't even know what this is,

00:07:01.342 --> 00:07:04.008
but what I do know
is what I can't handle right now

00:07:04.032 --> 00:07:07.052
is a breakup while someone I love
is in intensive care."

00:07:07.076 --> 00:07:09.439
(Laughter)

00:07:09.463 --> 00:07:13.488
So I called on my negotiation skills
and suggested we make a deal.

00:07:14.178 --> 00:07:17.971
I said, "I will stay with you
as long as you need me,

00:07:17.995 --> 00:07:20.061
as long as your back needs me.

00:07:20.085 --> 00:07:24.163
And when you no longer need me,
then we talk about our relationship."

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:28.315
Like a contract with the possibility
to renew in six months.

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:30.201
(Laughter)

00:07:31.458 --> 00:07:33.775
He agreed and I stayed.

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:38.855
In fact, I refused to go home
even to pack a bag, I slept by his bed,

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:41.363
when he could eat, I made all his food,

00:07:41.387 --> 00:07:46.890
and we cried, one or other
or both of us together, every day.

00:07:47.482 --> 00:07:50.895
I made all the complicated decisions
with the doctors,

00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:57.848
I climbed right into that raging river
over rapids that was sweeping Mark along.

00:08:00.371 --> 00:08:04.744
And at the first bend in that river,
Mark's surgeon told us

00:08:04.768 --> 00:08:08.887
what movement and feeling
he doesn't get back in the first 12 weeks,

00:08:08.911 --> 00:08:11.355
he's unlikely to get back at all.

00:08:13.046 --> 00:08:16.108
So, sitting by his bed,
I began to research why,

00:08:16.132 --> 00:08:19.046
after this period they call spinal shock,

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.096
there's no recovery, there's no therapy,
there's no cure, there's no hope.

00:08:25.111 --> 00:08:29.499
And the internet became this portal
to a magical other world.

00:08:29.523 --> 00:08:31.698
I emailed scientists,

00:08:31.722 --> 00:08:33.228
and they broke through paywalls

00:08:33.252 --> 00:08:37.184
and sent me their medical journal
and science journal articles directly.

00:08:37.569 --> 00:08:40.967
I read everything that "Superman" actor
Christopher Reeve had achieved,

00:08:40.991 --> 00:08:42.355
after a fall from a horse

00:08:42.379 --> 00:08:45.979
left him paralyzed from
the neck down and ventilated.

00:08:46.553 --> 00:08:49.086
Christopher had broken this 12-week spell;

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:53.267
he had regained some movement and feeling
years after his accident.

00:08:54.489 --> 00:08:58.289
He dreamed of a world
of empty wheelchairs.

00:08:59.117 --> 00:09:03.829
And Christopher and the scientists
he worked with fueled us with hope.

00:09:06.363 --> 00:09:08.499
MP: You see, spinal cord injury

00:09:08.523 --> 00:09:12.323
strikes at the very heart
of what it means to be human.

00:09:12.347 --> 00:09:17.294
And it had turned me from my upright,
standing, running form,

00:09:17.318 --> 00:09:20.818
into a seated compromise of myself.

00:09:21.128 --> 00:09:24.528
And it's not just the lack
of feeling and movement.

00:09:24.919 --> 00:09:28.037
Paralysis also interferes
with the body's internal systems,

00:09:28.061 --> 00:09:30.461
which are designed to keep us alive.

00:09:31.204 --> 00:09:36.275
Multiple infections, nerve pain,
spasms, shortened life spans are common.

00:09:36.656 --> 00:09:39.799
And these are the things that exhaust
even the most determined

00:09:39.823 --> 00:09:42.916
of the 60 million people
around the world who are paralyzed.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.155
Over 16 months in hospital,

00:09:48.179 --> 00:09:51.180
Simone and I were presented
with the expert view

00:09:51.204 --> 00:09:54.933
that hoping for a cure had proven
to be psychologically damaging.

00:09:55.434 --> 00:09:59.172
It was like the formal medical system
was canceling hope

00:09:59.196 --> 00:10:02.145
in favor of acceptance alone.

00:10:02.815 --> 00:10:07.664
But canceling hope ran contrary
to everything that we believed in.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.583
Yes, up to this point in history,

00:10:12.607 --> 00:10:15.421
it had proven to be impossible
to find a cure for paralysis,

00:10:15.445 --> 00:10:20.141
but history is filled with the kinds
of the impossible made possible

00:10:20.165 --> 00:10:21.698
through human endeavor.

00:10:22.006 --> 00:10:25.140
The kind of human endeavor
that took explorers to the South Pole

00:10:25.164 --> 00:10:27.188
at the start of the last century.

00:10:27.212 --> 00:10:29.172
And the kind of human endeavor

00:10:29.196 --> 00:10:33.863
that will take adventurers to Mars
in the early part of this century.

00:10:34.641 --> 00:10:36.704
So we started asking,

00:10:36.728 --> 00:10:41.283
"Why can't that same human endeavor
cure paralysis in our lifetime?"

00:10:42.528 --> 00:10:45.726
SG: Well, we really believed that it can.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.005
My research taught us

00:10:47.029 --> 00:10:52.331
that we needed to remind
Mark's damaged and dormant spinal cord

00:10:52.355 --> 00:10:54.632
of its upright, standing, running form,

00:10:54.656 --> 00:10:59.259
and we found San Francisco-based
engineers at Ekso Bionics,

00:10:59.283 --> 00:11:03.833
who created this robotic exoskeleton
that would allow Mark to stand and walk

00:11:03.857 --> 00:11:06.990
in the lab that we started
to build in Dublin.

00:11:07.911 --> 00:11:11.807
Mark became the first person
to personally own an exo,

00:11:11.831 --> 00:11:16.431
and since then, he and the robot
have walked over one million steps.

00:11:17.395 --> 00:11:22.822
(Applause)

00:11:22.846 --> 00:11:26.163
It was bit of an early celebration,
because actually it wasn't enough,

00:11:26.187 --> 00:11:28.983
the robot was doing all of the work,

00:11:29.007 --> 00:11:31.178
so we needed to plug Mark in.

00:11:31.934 --> 00:11:34.633
So we connected
the San Francisco engineers

00:11:34.657 --> 00:11:39.641
with a true visionary in UCLA,
Dr. Reggie Edgerton,

00:11:39.665 --> 00:11:41.506
the most beautiful man

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:46.082
and his team's life work had resulted
in a scientific breakthrough.

00:11:46.704 --> 00:11:49.840
Using electrical stimulation
of the spinal cord,

00:11:49.864 --> 00:11:52.683
a number of subjects
have been able to stand,

00:11:52.707 --> 00:11:55.888
and because of that,
regain some movement and feeling

00:11:55.912 --> 00:11:57.515
and most importantly,

00:11:57.539 --> 00:12:00.846
to regain some of the body's
internal functions

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:05.751
that are designed to keep us alive
and to make that life a pleasure.

00:12:06.903 --> 00:12:09.863
Electrical stimulation of the spinal cord,

00:12:09.887 --> 00:12:14.986
we think, is the first meaningful
therapy ever for paralyzed people.

00:12:16.692 --> 00:12:18.728
Now, of course,
the San Francisco engineers

00:12:18.752 --> 00:12:20.607
and the scientists in UCLA

00:12:20.631 --> 00:12:23.400
knew about each other,
knew about each other's work.

00:12:23.424 --> 00:12:25.395
But as so often happens

00:12:25.419 --> 00:12:32.331
when we're busy creating
groundbreaking scientific research,

00:12:32.355 --> 00:12:34.688
they hadn't quite yet got together.

00:12:35.442 --> 00:12:37.664
That seemed to be our job now.

00:12:38.609 --> 00:12:41.522
So we created our first collaboration,

00:12:41.546 --> 00:12:43.150
and the moment when we combined

00:12:43.174 --> 00:12:46.069
the electrical stimulation
of Mark's spinal cord,

00:12:46.093 --> 00:12:48.617
as he walked in his robotic exoskeleton,

00:12:48.641 --> 00:12:53.029
was like that moment when Iron Man
plugs the mini arc reactor into his chest

00:12:53.053 --> 00:12:57.506
and suddenly he and his suit
become something else altogether.

00:12:59.466 --> 00:13:04.950
MP: Simone, my robot and I moved
into the lab at UCLA for three months.

00:13:04.974 --> 00:13:07.395
And every day, Reggie and his team

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:10.783
put electrodes onto the skin
on my lower back,

00:13:10.807 --> 00:13:15.283
pushed electricity into my spinal cord
to excite my nervous system,

00:13:15.307 --> 00:13:18.005
as I walked in my exo.

00:13:18.538 --> 00:13:20.839
And for the first time
since I was paralyzed,

00:13:20.863 --> 00:13:23.640
I could feel my legs underneath me.

00:13:24.347 --> 00:13:25.515
Not normally --

00:13:25.539 --> 00:13:27.426
(Applause)

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:28.693
Thank you.

00:13:28.718 --> 00:13:30.162
(Applause)

00:13:30.553 --> 00:13:33.752
It wasn't a normal feeling,
but with the stimulator turned on,

00:13:33.776 --> 00:13:37.522
upright in my exo,
my legs felt substantial.

00:13:37.546 --> 00:13:43.149
I could feel the meat of my muscles
on the bones of my legs,

00:13:43.173 --> 00:13:46.339
and as I walked,
because of the stimulation,

00:13:46.363 --> 00:13:49.863
I was able to voluntarily move
my paralyzed legs.

00:13:49.887 --> 00:13:54.759
And as I did more,
the robot intelligently did less.

00:13:54.783 --> 00:13:58.188
My heart rate got a normal
running, training zone

00:13:58.212 --> 00:14:00.982
of 140 to 160 beats per minute,

00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:05.752
and my muscles, which had
almost entirely disappeared,

00:14:05.776 --> 00:14:07.176
started to come back.

00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:11.117
And during some standard testing
throughout the process,

00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:12.887
flat on my back,

00:14:12.911 --> 00:14:16.927
twelve weeks, six months
and three whole years

00:14:16.951 --> 00:14:20.266
after I fell out that window
and became paralyzed,

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:24.045
the scientists turned the stimulator on

00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:27.990
and I pulled my knee to my chest.

00:14:28.704 --> 00:14:31.990
(Video) Man: OK, start,
go, go, go, go, go.

00:14:32.014 --> 00:14:33.164
Good, good, good.

00:14:33.188 --> 00:14:37.164
SG: Yeah, yeah, go on, Mark,
go on, go, go, go, go, go, wow!

00:14:37.188 --> 00:14:38.339
(Applause)

00:14:38.363 --> 00:14:39.577
(Laughter)

00:14:40.339 --> 00:14:41.490
SG: Well done!

00:14:41.514 --> 00:14:44.333
(Applause)

00:14:45.183 --> 00:14:47.755
MP: Do you know, this week,
I've been saying to Simone,

00:14:47.779 --> 00:14:50.390
if we could forget about the paralysis,

00:14:50.414 --> 00:14:53.434
you know, the last few years
have been incredibly exciting.

00:14:53.458 --> 00:14:56.156
(Laughter)

00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:01.299
Now, the problem is, we can't quite
forget about the paralysis just yet.

00:15:01.323 --> 00:15:02.879
And clearly, we're not finished,

00:15:02.903 --> 00:15:05.823
because when we left that pilot study
and went back to Dublin,

00:15:05.847 --> 00:15:07.569
I rolled home in my wheelchair

00:15:07.593 --> 00:15:10.278
and I'm still paralyzed
and I'm still blind

00:15:10.302 --> 00:15:13.149
and we're primarily focusing
on the paralysis at the moment,

00:15:13.173 --> 00:15:14.681
but being at this conference,

00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:17.823
we're kind of interested if anyone
does have a cure for blindness,

00:15:17.847 --> 00:15:19.448
we'll take that as well.

00:15:19.472 --> 00:15:21.570
(Laughter)

00:15:21.594 --> 00:15:27.081
(Applause)

00:15:27.569 --> 00:15:30.673
But if you remember
the blog that I mentioned,

00:15:30.697 --> 00:15:33.347
it posed a question
of how we should respond,

00:15:33.371 --> 00:15:36.021
optimist, realist or something else?

00:15:36.045 --> 00:15:40.545
And I think we have come to understand
that the optimists rely on hope alone

00:15:40.569 --> 00:15:43.276
and they risk being
disappointed and demoralized.

00:15:44.479 --> 00:15:46.810
The realists, on the other hand,

00:15:48.129 --> 00:15:53.649
they accept the brutal facts
and they keep hope alive, as well.

00:15:54.034 --> 00:15:59.964
The realists have managed to resolve
the tension between acceptance and hope

00:15:59.988 --> 00:16:02.352
by running them in parallel.

00:16:02.376 --> 00:16:04.758
And that's what Simone and I
have been trying to do

00:16:04.782 --> 00:16:06.259
over the last number of years.

00:16:06.283 --> 00:16:08.718
Look, I accept the wheelchair --

00:16:08.742 --> 00:16:11.067
I mean, it's almost impossible not to.

00:16:11.091 --> 00:16:14.043
And we're sad, sometimes,
for what we've lost.

00:16:14.623 --> 00:16:20.002
I accept that I, and other wheelchair
users, can and do live fulfilling lives,

00:16:20.026 --> 00:16:23.510
despite the nerve pain
and the spasms and the infections

00:16:23.534 --> 00:16:25.201
and the shortened life spans.

00:16:25.765 --> 00:16:27.982
And I accept that it is way more difficult

00:16:28.006 --> 00:16:30.593
for people who are paralyzed
from the neck down.

00:16:30.617 --> 00:16:33.487
For those who rely
on ventilators to breathe,

00:16:33.511 --> 00:16:38.257
and for those who don't have access
to adequate, free health care.

00:16:38.967 --> 00:16:44.118
So, that is why we also hope
for another life.

00:16:44.467 --> 00:16:48.269
A life where we have created a cure
through collaboration.

00:16:48.636 --> 00:16:53.288
A cure that we are actively working
to release from university labs

00:16:53.312 --> 00:16:54.597
around the world

00:16:54.621 --> 00:16:57.707
and share with everyone who needs it.

00:16:59.988 --> 00:17:02.885
SG: I met Mark when he was just blind.

00:17:04.171 --> 00:17:07.361
He asked me to teach him
to dance, and I did.

00:17:08.125 --> 00:17:09.847
One night, after dance classes,

00:17:09.871 --> 00:17:12.329
I turned to say goodnight
to him at his front door,

00:17:12.353 --> 00:17:15.210
and to his gorgeous guide dog, Larry.

00:17:15.752 --> 00:17:19.061
I realized, that in switching
all the lights off in the apartment

00:17:19.085 --> 00:17:20.252
before I left,

00:17:20.276 --> 00:17:22.194
that I was leaving him in the dark.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:29.647
I burst into uncontrollable tears
and tried to hide it, but he knew.

00:17:30.284 --> 00:17:33.164
And he hugged me and said,

00:17:33.188 --> 00:17:34.653
"Ah, poor Simone.

00:17:35.046 --> 00:17:37.877
You're back in 1998, when I went blind.

00:17:39.585 --> 00:17:42.934
Don't worry, it turns out OK in the end."

00:17:44.649 --> 00:17:49.975
Acceptance is knowing
that grief is a raging river.

00:17:51.187 --> 00:17:53.054
And you have to get into it.

00:17:53.647 --> 00:17:57.314
Because when you do,
it carries you to the next place.

00:17:58.133 --> 00:18:00.823
It eventually takes you to open land,

00:18:00.847 --> 00:18:04.363
somewhere where it will
turn out OK in the end.

00:18:06.959 --> 00:18:09.626
And it truly has been a love story,

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:15.428
an expansive, abundant,
deeply satisfying kind of love

00:18:15.452 --> 00:18:20.569
for our fellow humans and everyone
in this act of creation.

00:18:22.331 --> 00:18:24.355
Science is love.

00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:26.752
Everyone we've met in this field

00:18:26.776 --> 00:18:30.825
just wants to get their work
from the bench and into people's lives.

00:18:31.548 --> 00:18:34.281
And it's our job to help them to do that.

00:18:35.381 --> 00:18:39.625
Because when we do,
we and everyone with us

00:18:39.649 --> 00:18:41.537
in this act of creation

00:18:41.561 --> 00:18:43.808
will be able to say,

00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:45.506
"We did it.

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:46.863
And then we danced."

00:18:49.242 --> 00:18:55.767
(Video) (Music)

00:18:56.797 --> 00:18:57.947
SG: Thank you.

00:18:58.825 --> 00:19:03.734
(Applause)

00:19:03.758 --> 00:19:04.916
MP: Thank you.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:11.849
(Applause)

00:19:13.286 --> 00:19:14.436
Thank you.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:21.395
(Applause)
