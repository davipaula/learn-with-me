00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:14.609
People don't realize

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:18.792
that red light and benign
near-infrared light

00:00:18.816 --> 00:00:22.173
go right through your hand,
just like this.

00:00:23.157 --> 00:00:28.343
This fact could enable better,
faster and cheaper health care.

00:00:28.696 --> 00:00:31.601
Our translucence is key here.

00:00:32.093 --> 00:00:35.955
I'm going to show you how we use
this key and a couple of other keys

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:38.712
to see deep inside our bodies and brains.

00:00:40.043 --> 00:00:41.558
OK, so first up ...

00:00:42.868 --> 00:00:46.299
You see this laser pointer
and the spot it makes on my hand?

00:00:47.624 --> 00:00:49.510
The light goes right through my hand --

00:00:49.534 --> 00:00:51.601
if we could bring
the lights down, please --

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:52.806
as I've already shown.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.584
But you can no longer see that laser spot.

00:00:55.608 --> 00:00:57.068
You see my hand glow.

00:00:58.013 --> 00:01:01.703
That's because the light
spreads out, it scatters.

00:01:02.226 --> 00:01:05.434
I need you to understand
what scattering is,

00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:08.260
so I can show you how we get rid of it

00:01:08.284 --> 00:01:10.720
and see deep inside our bodies and brains.

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:14.910
So, I've got a piece of chicken back here.

00:01:15.683 --> 00:01:17.069
(Laughter)

00:01:17.093 --> 00:01:18.243
It's raw.

00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:21.703
Putting on some gloves.

00:01:21.727 --> 00:01:26.270
It's got the same
optical properties as human flesh.

00:01:29.204 --> 00:01:33.735
So, here's the chicken ...
putting it on the light.

00:01:34.744 --> 00:01:36.900
Can you see, the light goes right through?

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.464
I also implanted a tumor in that chicken.

00:01:42.215 --> 00:01:43.395
Can you see it?

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:44.747
Audience: Yes.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:49.443
Mary Lou Jepsen: So this means,
using red light and infrared light,

00:01:49.467 --> 00:01:51.924
we can see tumors in human flesh.

00:01:53.117 --> 00:01:54.450
But there's a catch.

00:01:55.534 --> 00:01:57.828
When I throw another
piece of chicken on it,

00:01:59.137 --> 00:02:00.924
the light still goes through,

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.450
but you can no longer see the tumor.

00:02:05.188 --> 00:02:07.807
That's because the light scatters.

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:10.917
So we have to do something
about the scatter

00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:12.541
so we can see the tumor.

00:02:14.055 --> 00:02:16.188
We have to de-scatter the light.

00:02:17.245 --> 00:02:18.395
So ...

00:02:19.785 --> 00:02:22.633
A technology I spent
the early part of my career on

00:02:22.657 --> 00:02:24.125
enables de-scattering.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.253
It's called holography.

00:02:26.728 --> 00:02:29.664
And it won the Nobel Prize
in physics in the 70s,

00:02:29.688 --> 00:02:33.720
because of the fantastic things
it enables you to do with light.

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.146
This is a hologram.

00:02:36.934 --> 00:02:41.505
It captures all of the light,
all of the rays, all of the photons

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:46.039
at all of the positions
and all of the angles, simultaneously.

00:02:47.173 --> 00:02:48.323
It's amazing.

00:02:48.831 --> 00:02:51.462
To see what we can do with holography ...

00:02:53.022 --> 00:02:54.498
You see these marbles?

00:02:54.522 --> 00:02:57.231
Look at these marbles
bouncing off of the barriers,

00:02:57.688 --> 00:03:01.418
as an analogy to light
being scattered by our bodies.

00:03:02.323 --> 00:03:06.339
As the marbles get to the bottom
of the scattering maze,

00:03:06.363 --> 00:03:10.430
they're chaotic, they're scattering
and bouncing everywhere.

00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:15.252
If we record a hologram
at the bottom inside of the screen,

00:03:15.276 --> 00:03:21.815
we can record the position and angle
of each marble exiting the maze.

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:24.853
And then we can bring in
marbles from below

00:03:26.061 --> 00:03:32.209
and have the hologram direct each marble
to exactly the right position and angle,

00:03:32.233 --> 00:03:37.495
such as they emerge in a line
at the top of the scatter matrix.

00:03:39.162 --> 00:03:41.078
We're going to do that with this.

00:03:41.732 --> 00:03:46.014
This is optically similar to human brain.

00:03:46.787 --> 00:03:49.477
I'm going to switch to green light now,

00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:53.259
because green light is brighter
to your eyes than red or infrared,

00:03:53.283 --> 00:03:55.243
and I really need you to see this.

00:03:55.665 --> 00:04:00.490
So we're going to put a hologram
in front of this brain

00:04:00.514 --> 00:04:03.180
and make a stream of light come out of it.

00:04:04.831 --> 00:04:07.760
Seems impossible but it isn't.

00:04:07.784 --> 00:04:09.990
This is the setup you're going to see.

00:04:10.014 --> 00:04:11.164
Green light.

00:04:12.514 --> 00:04:15.379
Hologram here, green light going in,

00:04:15.403 --> 00:04:16.553
that's our brain.

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:22.849
And a stream of light comes out of it.

00:04:22.873 --> 00:04:27.603
We just made a brain lase
of densely scattering tissue.

00:04:27.627 --> 00:04:30.897
Seems impossible,
no one's done this before,

00:04:30.921 --> 00:04:33.661
you're the first public audience
to ever see this.

00:04:33.685 --> 00:04:38.471
(Applause)

00:04:38.495 --> 00:04:42.162
What this means is
that we can focus deep into tissue.

00:04:42.805 --> 00:04:45.815
Our translucency is the first key.

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:49.870
Holography enabling de-scattering
is the second key

00:04:49.894 --> 00:04:53.761
to enable us to see deep inside
of our bodies and brains.

00:04:54.981 --> 00:04:56.648
You're probably thinking,

00:04:57.118 --> 00:05:00.127
"Sounds good, but what about
skull and bones?

00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:04.221
How are you going to see through the brain
without seeing through bone?"

00:05:04.245 --> 00:05:06.533
Well, this is real human skull.

00:05:07.188 --> 00:05:10.323
We ordered it at skullsunlimited.com.

00:05:10.347 --> 00:05:12.093
(Laughter)

00:05:12.117 --> 00:05:13.355
No kidding.

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:18.103
But we treat this skull with great respect
at our lab and here at TED.

00:05:18.127 --> 00:05:19.723
And as you can see,

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.760
the red light goes right through it.

00:05:23.912 --> 00:05:25.447
Goes through our bones.

00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:30.489
So we can go through skull
and bones and flesh with just red light.

00:05:31.268 --> 00:05:34.997
Gamma rays and X-rays do that, too,
but they cause tumors.

00:05:35.637 --> 00:05:38.713
Red light is all around us.

00:05:39.137 --> 00:05:42.041
So, using that, I'm going
to come back here

00:05:42.065 --> 00:05:45.468
and show you something more useful
than making a brain lase.

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:50.183
We challenged ourselves to see how fine
we could focus through brain tissue.

00:05:50.967 --> 00:05:53.069
Focusing through this brain,

00:05:53.093 --> 00:05:57.667
it was such a fine focus,
we put a bare camera die in front of it.

00:05:58.288 --> 00:06:00.088
And the bare camera die ...

00:06:03.454 --> 00:06:05.081
Could you turn down the spotlight?

00:06:05.105 --> 00:06:06.255
OK, there it is.

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:08.276
Do you see that?

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.576
Each pixel is two-thousandths
of a millimeter wide.

00:06:13.673 --> 00:06:15.077
Two microns.

00:06:15.101 --> 00:06:18.490
That means that spot focus --
full width half max --

00:06:18.514 --> 00:06:20.304
is six to eight microns.

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:23.654
To give you an idea of what that means:

00:06:24.442 --> 00:06:28.444
that's the diameter of the smallest neuron
in the human brain.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.750
So that means we can focus
through skull and brain to a neuron.

00:06:34.104 --> 00:06:37.738
No one has seen this before,
we're doing this for the first time here.

00:06:38.207 --> 00:06:39.796
It's not impossible.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.762
(Applause)

00:06:41.786 --> 00:06:44.768
We made it work with our system,
so we've made a breakthrough.

00:06:44.792 --> 00:06:46.593
(Laughter)

00:06:46.617 --> 00:06:49.569
Just to give an idea -- like,
that's not just 50 marbles.

00:06:49.593 --> 00:06:52.490
That's billions, trillion of photons,

00:06:52.514 --> 00:06:55.910
all falling in line as directed
by the hologram,

00:06:55.934 --> 00:07:01.005
to ricochet through
densely scattering brain,

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:03.966
and emerge as a focus.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.998
It's pretty cool.

00:07:06.022 --> 00:07:07.299
We're excited about it.

00:07:07.728 --> 00:07:09.760
This is an MRI machine.

00:07:09.784 --> 00:07:11.946
It's a few million dollars,
it fills a room,

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.156
many people have probably been in one.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.720
I've spent a lot of time in one.

00:07:15.744 --> 00:07:18.141
It has a focus of about a millimeter --

00:07:18.165 --> 00:07:20.998
kind of chunky, compared to
what I just showed you.

00:07:21.022 --> 00:07:26.680
A system based on our technology
could enable dramatically lower cost,

00:07:26.704 --> 00:07:28.519
higher resolution

00:07:28.543 --> 00:07:31.036
and smaller medical imaging.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.549
So that's what we've started to do.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.408
My team and I have built a rig, a lab rig

00:07:38.432 --> 00:07:40.288
to scan out tissue.

00:07:40.797 --> 00:07:42.463
And here it is in action.

00:07:42.932 --> 00:07:45.074
We wanted to see how good we could do.

00:07:46.535 --> 00:07:48.596
We've built this over the last year.

00:07:49.626 --> 00:07:51.151
And the result is,

00:07:51.814 --> 00:07:56.151
we're able to find tumors

00:07:56.175 --> 00:07:57.345
in this sample --

00:07:57.369 --> 00:08:00.510
70 millimeters deep,
the light going in here,

00:08:00.534 --> 00:08:02.748
half a millimeter resolution,

00:08:02.772 --> 00:08:05.060
and that's the tumor it found.

00:08:05.526 --> 00:08:07.987
You're probably looking at this,

00:08:08.011 --> 00:08:13.002
like, "Sounds good,
but that's kind of a big system.

00:08:13.026 --> 00:08:17.577
It's smaller than
a honking-big MRI machine,

00:08:17.601 --> 00:08:18.951
monster MRI machine,

00:08:18.975 --> 00:08:21.140
but can you do something
to shrink it down?"

00:08:22.038 --> 00:08:23.822
And the answer is:

00:08:23.846 --> 00:08:25.016
of course.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.660
We can replace each
big element in that system

00:08:28.684 --> 00:08:30.279
with a smaller component --

00:08:30.303 --> 00:08:32.200
a little integrated circuit,

00:08:32.224 --> 00:08:36.363
a display chip the size
of a child's fingernail.

00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:39.006
A bit about my background:

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:45.265
I've spent the last two decades
inventing, prototype-developing

00:08:45.289 --> 00:08:50.248
and then shipping billions of dollars
of consumer electronics --

00:08:50.272 --> 00:08:52.577
with full custom chips --

00:08:52.601 --> 00:08:55.337
on the hairy edge of optical physics.

00:08:55.919 --> 00:09:00.601
So my team and I built the big lab rig

00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:05.367
to perfect our architecture
and test the corner cases

00:09:05.849 --> 00:09:08.040
and really fine-tune our chip designs,

00:09:08.064 --> 00:09:11.713
before spending the millions of dollars
to fabricate each chip.

00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:16.990
Our new chip inventions
slim down the system, speed it up

00:09:17.014 --> 00:09:21.097
and enable rapid scanning
and de-scattering of light

00:09:21.121 --> 00:09:22.988
to see deep into our bodies.

00:09:23.498 --> 00:09:29.023
This is the third key to enable
better, faster and cheaper health care.

00:09:33.577 --> 00:09:40.282
This is a mock-up of something
that can replace the functionality

00:09:40.306 --> 00:09:43.276
of a multimillion-dollar MRI machine

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.990
into a consumer electronics price point,

00:09:46.014 --> 00:09:51.347
that you could wear as a bandage,
line a ski hat, put inside a pillow.

00:09:51.882 --> 00:09:53.554
That's what we're building.

00:09:53.578 --> 00:09:54.747
(Applause)

00:09:54.771 --> 00:09:56.050
Oh, thanks!

00:09:56.074 --> 00:09:59.049
(Applause)

00:09:59.073 --> 00:10:01.212
So you're probably thinking,

00:10:01.236 --> 00:10:04.069
"I get the light going through our bodies.

00:10:04.911 --> 00:10:07.845
I even get the holography
de-scattering the light.

00:10:08.656 --> 00:10:11.523
But how do we use these new
chip inventions, exactly,

00:10:11.547 --> 00:10:12.802
to do the scanning?"

00:10:13.903 --> 00:10:15.969
Well, we have a sound approach.

00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:18.277
No, literally -- we use sound.

00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:23.049
Here, these three discs represent
the integrated circuits

00:10:23.073 --> 00:10:24.538
that we've designed,

00:10:24.562 --> 00:10:29.409
that massively reduce the size
of our current bulky system.

00:10:30.157 --> 00:10:33.577
One of the spots, one of the chips,
emits a sonic ping,

00:10:34.369 --> 00:10:36.023
and it focuses down,

00:10:36.696 --> 00:10:38.777
and then we turn red light on.

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:42.743
And the red light that goes
through that sonic spot

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:45.127
changes color slightly,

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.685
much like the pitch
of the police car siren changes

00:10:48.709 --> 00:10:50.176
as it speeds past you.

00:10:52.042 --> 00:10:53.283
So.

00:10:53.307 --> 00:10:56.608
There's this other thing about holography
I haven't told you yet,

00:10:56.632 --> 00:10:57.941
that you need to know.

00:10:58.427 --> 00:11:03.196
Only two beams of exactly the same color
can make a hologram.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:09.156
So, that's the orange light
that's coming off of the sonic spot,

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.363
that's changed color slightly,

00:11:11.387 --> 00:11:15.036
and we create a glowing disc
of orange light

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.679
underneath a neighboring chip

00:11:17.212 --> 00:11:20.839
and then record a hologram
on the camera chip.

00:11:21.362 --> 00:11:22.577
Like so.

00:11:22.601 --> 00:11:27.934
From that hologram, we can extract
information just about that sonic spot,

00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:30.892
because we filter out
all of the red light.

00:11:32.037 --> 00:11:35.964
Then, we can optionally
focus the light back down into the brain

00:11:35.988 --> 00:11:39.171
to stimulate a neuron
or part of the brain.

00:11:39.195 --> 00:11:44.299
And then we move on
to shift the sonic focus to another spot.

00:11:44.323 --> 00:11:48.283
And that way, spot by spot,
we scan out the brain.

00:11:49.309 --> 00:11:51.952
Our chips decode holograms

00:11:51.976 --> 00:11:57.740
a bit like Rosalind Franklin decoded
this iconic image of X-ray diffraction

00:11:57.764 --> 00:12:00.875
to reveal the structure of DNA
for the first time.

00:12:01.379 --> 00:12:04.571
We're doing that electronically
with our chips,

00:12:04.595 --> 00:12:08.332
recording the image
and decoding the information,

00:12:08.356 --> 00:12:10.184
in a millionth of a second.

00:12:10.612 --> 00:12:12.287
We scan fast.

00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:16.958
Our system may be extraordinary
at finding blood.

00:12:17.534 --> 00:12:21.415
And that's because blood absorbs
red light and infrared light.

00:12:21.439 --> 00:12:23.002
Blood is red.

00:12:23.995 --> 00:12:25.383
Here's a beaker of blood.

00:12:25.407 --> 00:12:26.874
I'm going to show you.

00:12:27.704 --> 00:12:30.771
And here's our laser,
going right through it.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.109
It really is a laser,
you can see it on the -- there it is.

00:12:34.133 --> 00:12:38.074
In comparison to my pound of flesh,

00:12:38.098 --> 00:12:40.526
where you can see
the light goes everywhere.

00:12:41.415 --> 00:12:43.482
So let's see that again, blood.

00:12:44.303 --> 00:12:47.006
This is really key: blood absorbs light,

00:12:47.989 --> 00:12:50.195
flesh scatters light.

00:12:51.133 --> 00:12:52.521
This is significant,

00:12:52.545 --> 00:12:56.410
because every tumor bigger
than a cubic millimeter or two

00:12:56.434 --> 00:13:00.213
has five times the amount of blood
as normal flesh.

00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:05.691
So with our system, you can imagine
detecting cancers early,

00:13:05.715 --> 00:13:07.855
when intervention is easy,

00:13:07.879 --> 00:13:11.812
or tracking the size of your tumor
as it grows or shrinks.

00:13:12.338 --> 00:13:17.474
Our system also should be extraordinary
at finding out where blood isn't,

00:13:17.498 --> 00:13:19.220
like a clogged artery,

00:13:19.244 --> 00:13:21.245
or the color change in blood

00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:24.857
as it carries oxygen
versus not carrying oxygen,

00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:27.681
which is a way to measure neural activity.

00:13:28.872 --> 00:13:33.506
There's a saying that "sunlight"
is the best disinfectant.

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.042
It's literally true.

00:13:35.563 --> 00:13:41.725
Researchers are killing pneumonia in lungs
by shining light deep inside of lungs.

00:13:41.749 --> 00:13:45.003
Our system could enable this
noninvasively.

00:13:45.932 --> 00:13:50.211
Let me give you three more examples
of what this technology can do.

00:13:50.592 --> 00:13:51.981
One: stroke.

00:13:52.601 --> 00:13:54.868
There's two major kinds of stroke:

00:13:54.892 --> 00:13:57.044
the one caused by clogs

00:13:57.068 --> 00:13:59.029
and another caused by rupture.

00:13:59.053 --> 00:14:03.151
If you can determine the type of stroke
within an hour or two,

00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:07.883
you can give medication to massively
reduce the damage to the brain.

00:14:08.358 --> 00:14:09.810
Get the drug wrong,

00:14:10.675 --> 00:14:12.016
and the patient dies.

00:14:12.752 --> 00:14:17.480
Today, that means access to an MRI scanner
within an hour or two of a stroke.

00:14:18.306 --> 00:14:22.577
Tomorrow, with compact, portable,
inexpensive imaging,

00:14:22.601 --> 00:14:26.431
every ambulance and every clinic
can decode the type of stroke

00:14:26.455 --> 00:14:28.738
and get the right therapy on time.

00:14:30.396 --> 00:14:34.417
(Applause)

00:14:34.441 --> 00:14:35.591
Thanks.

00:14:36.155 --> 00:14:37.305
Two:

00:14:38.085 --> 00:14:42.681
two-thirds of humanity
lacks access to medical imaging.

00:14:43.394 --> 00:14:48.418
Compact, portable, inexpensive
medical imaging can save countless lives.

00:14:49.347 --> 00:14:50.902
And three:

00:14:50.926 --> 00:14:52.988
brain-computer communication.

00:14:53.529 --> 00:14:57.877
I've shown here onstage our system
focusing through skull and brain

00:14:57.901 --> 00:15:00.631
to the diameter of the smallest neuron.

00:15:01.187 --> 00:15:05.474
Using light and sound,
you can activate or inhibit neurons,

00:15:05.498 --> 00:15:08.990
and simultaneously,
we can match spec by spec

00:15:09.014 --> 00:15:11.720
the resolution of an fMRI scanner,

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:14.252
which measures oxygen use in the brain.

00:15:14.276 --> 00:15:17.617
We do that by looking
at the color change in the blood,

00:15:17.641 --> 00:15:19.974
rather than using a two-ton magnet.

00:15:21.541 --> 00:15:27.693
So you can imagine
that with fMRI scanners today,

00:15:28.617 --> 00:15:33.174
we can decode the imagined words,
images and dreams of those being scanned.

00:15:33.665 --> 00:15:36.982
We're working on a system
that puts all three of these capabilities

00:15:37.006 --> 00:15:38.553
into the same system --

00:15:38.577 --> 00:15:41.791
neural read and write
with light and sound,

00:15:41.815 --> 00:15:45.942
while simultaneously
mapping oxygen use in the brain --

00:15:45.966 --> 00:15:48.553
all together in a noninvasive portable

00:15:48.577 --> 00:15:51.363
that can enable
brain-computer communication,

00:15:51.387 --> 00:15:55.713
no implants, no surgery,
no optional brain surgery required.

00:15:56.061 --> 00:15:58.141
This can do enormous good

00:15:58.165 --> 00:16:02.698
for the two billion people
that suffer globally with brain disease.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:09.155
(Applause)

00:16:09.179 --> 00:16:11.069
People ask me how deep we can go.

00:16:11.093 --> 00:16:14.022
And the answer is:
the whole body's in reach.

00:16:14.046 --> 00:16:16.082
But here's another way to look at it.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.204
(Laughter)

00:16:22.228 --> 00:16:24.840
My whole head just lit up,
you want to see it again?

00:16:24.864 --> 00:16:26.094
Audience: Yes!

00:16:26.118 --> 00:16:27.535
(Laughter)

00:16:28.442 --> 00:16:30.663
MLJ: This looks scary, but it's not.

00:16:31.046 --> 00:16:34.029
What's truly scary
is not knowing about our bodies,

00:16:34.053 --> 00:16:36.045
our brains and our diseases

00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:38.014
so we can effectively treat them.

00:16:38.038 --> 00:16:39.696
This technology can help.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.871
Thank you.

00:16:40.895 --> 00:16:46.349
(Applause)

00:16:46.373 --> 00:16:47.524
Thank you.

00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:48.698
(Applause)
