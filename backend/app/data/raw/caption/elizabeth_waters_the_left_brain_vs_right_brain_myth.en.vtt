00:00:06.593 --> 00:00:08.552
Behold the human brain,

00:00:08.552 --> 00:00:13.533
it's lumpy landscape visibly split into
a left and right side.

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:18.458
This structure has inspired one of 
the most pervasive ideas about the brain,

00:00:18.458 --> 00:00:20.444
that the left side controls logic

00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:22.924
and the right, creativity.

00:00:22.924 --> 00:00:28.023
And yet, this is a myth unsupported
by scientific evidence.

00:00:28.023 --> 00:00:30.524
So how did this misleading idea
come about,

00:00:30.524 --> 00:00:33.184
and what does it get wrong?

00:00:33.184 --> 00:00:36.266
It's true that the brain has a right
and a left side.

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:40.105
This is most apparent 
with the outer layer, or the cortex.

00:00:40.105 --> 00:00:42.454
Internal regions, like the striatum,

00:00:42.454 --> 00:00:43.555
hypothalamus,

00:00:43.555 --> 00:00:44.475
thalamus,

00:00:44.475 --> 00:00:45.766
and brain stem

00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.646
appear to be made from continuous tissue,

00:00:48.646 --> 00:00:53.426
but in fact, they're also organized
with left and right sides.

00:00:53.426 --> 00:00:57.217
The left and the right sides of the brain
do control different body functions,

00:00:57.217 --> 00:00:59.896
such as movement and sight.

00:00:59.896 --> 00:01:05.447
The brain's right side controls the motion
of the left arm and leg and vice versa.

00:01:05.447 --> 00:01:08.667
The visual system is even more complex.

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:12.517
Each eye has a left 
and right visual field.

00:01:12.517 --> 00:01:16.388
Both left visual fields are sent
to the right side of the brain,

00:01:16.388 --> 00:01:19.548
and both right fields 
are sent to the left side.

00:01:19.548 --> 00:01:24.436
So the brain uses both sides to make
a complete image of the world.

00:01:24.436 --> 00:01:29.918
Scientists don't know for sure
why we have that crossing over.

00:01:29.918 --> 00:01:35.347
One theory is it began soon after animals
developed more complex nervous systems

00:01:35.347 --> 00:01:39.848
because it gave the survival advantage
of quicker reflexes.

00:01:39.848 --> 00:01:42.689
If an animal sees a predator coming
from its left side,

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.781
it's best off escaping to the right.

00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:49.549
So we can say that vision 
and movement control are two systems

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.929
that rely on this left-right structure,

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:59.381
but problems arise when we over-extend
that idea to logic and creativity.

00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:02.360
This misconception began in 
the mid-1800s

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.421
when two neurologists, Broca and Wernicke,

00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:10.981
examined patients who had problems
communicating due to injuries.

00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:15.052
The researchers found damage to
the patients' left temporal lobes,

00:02:15.052 --> 00:02:20.221
so they suggested that language is
controlled by the left side of the brain.

00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:22.702
That captured the popular imagination.

00:02:22.702 --> 00:02:24.211
Author Robert Louis Stevenson

00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:27.832
then introduced the idea 
of a logical left hemisphere

00:02:27.832 --> 00:02:30.762
competing with an emotional 
right hemisphere

00:02:30.762 --> 00:02:35.373
represented by his characters
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

00:02:35.373 --> 00:02:38.236
But this idea didn't hold up when doctors
and scientists

00:02:38.236 --> 00:02:41.247
examined patients who were missing
a hemisphere

00:02:41.247 --> 00:02:44.732
or had their two hemispheres separated.

00:02:44.732 --> 00:02:47.960
These patients showed a complete
range of behaviors,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.614
both logical and creative.

00:02:50.614 --> 00:02:55.393
Later research showed that one side
of the brain is more active than the other

00:02:55.393 --> 00:02:57.704
for some functions.

00:02:57.704 --> 00:03:00.265
Language is more localized to the left

00:03:00.265 --> 00:03:03.084
and attention to the right.

00:03:03.084 --> 00:03:05.384
So one side of the brain may do more work,

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:09.555
but this varies by system
rather than by person.

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:11.355
There isn't any evidence to suggest

00:03:11.355 --> 00:03:14.654
that individuals have dominant 
sides of the brain,

00:03:14.654 --> 00:03:17.635
or to support the idea 
of a left-right split

00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:20.305
between logic and creativity.

00:03:20.305 --> 00:03:23.725
Some people may be particularly logical
or creative,

00:03:23.725 --> 00:03:27.084
but that has nothing to do with the sides
of their brains.

00:03:27.084 --> 00:03:31.564
And even the idea of logic and creativity
being at odds with each other

00:03:31.564 --> 00:03:33.714
doesn't hold up well.

00:03:33.714 --> 00:03:37.677
Solving complex math problems requires
inspired creativity

00:03:37.677 --> 00:03:42.456
and many vibrant works of art
have intricate logical frameworks.

00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:45.798
Almost every feat of creativity and logic

00:03:45.798 --> 00:03:49.826
carries the mark of the whole brain
functioning as one.
