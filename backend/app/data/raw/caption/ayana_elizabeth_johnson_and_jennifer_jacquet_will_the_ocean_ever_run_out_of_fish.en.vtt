00:00:07.346 --> 00:00:09.221
Fish are in trouble.

00:00:09.221 --> 00:00:13.874
The cod population off Canada's East Coast
collapsed in the 1990s,

00:00:13.874 --> 00:00:16.146
intense recreational 
and commercial fishing

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:20.142
has decimated goliath grouper populations
in South Florida,

00:00:20.142 --> 00:00:24.137
and most populations of tuna
have plummeted by over 50%,

00:00:24.137 --> 00:00:28.022
with the Southern Atlantic bluefin
on the verge of extinction.

00:00:28.022 --> 00:00:30.704
Those are just a couple of many examples.

00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:33.283
Overfishing is happening 
all over the world.

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:34.515
How did this happen?

00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:36.222
When some people think of fishing,

00:00:36.222 --> 00:00:40.714
they imagine relaxing in a boat
and patiently reeling in the day's catch.

00:00:40.714 --> 00:00:44.533
But modern industrial fishing,
the kind that stocks our grocery shelves,

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:46.705
looks more like warfare.

00:00:46.705 --> 00:00:50.676
In fact, the technologies they employ
were developed for war.

00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:51.582
Radar,

00:00:51.582 --> 00:00:52.352
sonar,

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:53.285
helicopters,

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:54.375
and spotter planes

00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:58.584
are all used to guide factory ships
towards dwindling schools of fish.

00:00:58.584 --> 00:01:00.835
Long lines with hundreds
of hooks or huge nets

00:01:00.835 --> 00:01:04.474
round up massive amounts of fish,
along with other species,

00:01:04.474 --> 00:01:07.506
like seabirds, turtles, and dolphins.

00:01:07.506 --> 00:01:09.643
And fish are hauled up onto giant boats,

00:01:09.643 --> 00:01:13.336
complete with onboard flash freezing
and processing facilities.

00:01:13.336 --> 00:01:17.195
All of these technologies have enabled
us to catch fish at greater depths

00:01:17.195 --> 00:01:19.976
and farther out at sea than ever before.

00:01:19.976 --> 00:01:22.667
And as the distance and depth
of fishing have expanded,

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:25.536
so has the variety of species we target.

00:01:25.536 --> 00:01:30.156
For example, the Patagonian toothfish
neither sounds nor looks very appetizing.

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:33.346
And fishermen ignored it until
the late 1970s.

00:01:33.346 --> 00:01:37.549
Then it was rebranded and marketed
to chefs in the U.S. as Chilean sea bass,

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.866
despite the animal actually 
being a type of cod.

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:43.596
Soon it was popping up in markets
all over the world

00:01:43.596 --> 00:01:45.557
and is now a delicacy.

00:01:45.557 --> 00:01:48.476
Unfortunately, these deep water fish 
don't reproduce

00:01:48.476 --> 00:01:50.618
until they're at least ten years old,

00:01:50.618 --> 00:01:53.058
making them extremely vulnerable
to overfishing

00:01:53.058 --> 00:01:56.137
when the young are caught before they've
had the chance to spawn.

00:01:56.137 --> 00:01:59.278
Consumer taste and prices can
also have harmful effects.

00:01:59.278 --> 00:02:04.147
For example, shark fin soup is considered
such a delicacy in China and Vietnam

00:02:04.147 --> 00:02:07.889
that the fin has become 
the most profitable part of the shark.

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:10.469
This leads many fishermen to fill
their boats with fins

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.739
leaving millions of dead sharks behind.

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.349
The problems aren't unique
to toothfish and sharks.

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.098
Almost 31% of the world's fish populations
are overfished,

00:02:19.098 --> 00:02:24.419
and another 58% are fished
at the maximum sustainable level.

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:29.199
Wild fish simply can't reproduce
as fast as 7 billion people can eat them.

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:32.310
Fishing also has impacts
on broader ecosystems.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.969
Wild shrimp are typically caught by
dragging nets the size of a football field

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:37.720
along the ocean bottom,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.629
disrupting or destroying
seafloor habitats.

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.311
The catch is often as little as 5% shrimp.

00:02:43.311 --> 00:02:47.881
The rest is by-catch, unwanted 
animals that are thrown back dead.

00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:50.360
And coastal shrimp farming isn't
much better.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.261
Mangroves are bulldozed to make room
for shrimp farms,

00:02:53.261 --> 00:02:57.339
robbing coastal communities of storm
protection and natural water filtration

00:02:57.339 --> 00:03:00.361
and depriving fish of key
nursery habitats.

00:03:00.361 --> 00:03:04.161
So what does it look like to give
fish a break and let them recover?

00:03:04.161 --> 00:03:05.861
Protection can take many forms.

00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:08.911
In national waters,
governments can set limits

00:03:08.911 --> 00:03:13.589
about how, when, where, 
and how much fishing occurs,

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:15.963
with restrictions on certain 
boats and equipment.

00:03:15.963 --> 00:03:20.481
Harmful practices, such as bottom 
trawling, can be banned altogether,

00:03:20.481 --> 00:03:23.471
and we can establish marine reserves
closed to all fishing

00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:26.234
to help ecosystems restore themselves.

00:03:26.234 --> 00:03:30.752
There's also a role for consumer awareness
and boycotts to reduce wasteful practices,

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:31.796
like shark finning,

00:03:31.796 --> 00:03:35.341
and push fishing industries towards
more sustainable practices.

00:03:35.341 --> 00:03:39.614
Past interventions have successfully
helped depleted fish populations recover.

00:03:39.614 --> 00:03:41.402
There are many solutions.

00:03:41.402 --> 00:03:45.123
The best approach for each fishery
must be considered based on science,

00:03:45.123 --> 00:03:47.933
respect for the local communities
that rely on the ocean,

00:03:47.933 --> 00:03:50.164
and for fish as wild animals.

00:03:50.164 --> 00:03:52.093
And then the rules must be enforced.

00:03:52.093 --> 00:03:55.084
International collaboration is often
needed, too,

00:03:55.084 --> 00:03:58.293
because fish don't care about our borders.

00:03:58.293 --> 00:04:00.114
We need to end overfishing.

00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:01.173
Ecosystems,

00:04:01.173 --> 00:04:02.275
food security,

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:03.043
jobs,

00:04:03.043 --> 00:04:03.773
economies,

00:04:03.773 --> 00:04:05.844
and coastal cultures all depend on it.
