00:00:07.505 --> 00:00:10.815
At a Maryland country fair in 2017,

00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:14.055
the prize pigs were not 
looking their best.

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:19.145
Farmers reported feverish hogs with 
inflamed eyes and running snouts.

00:00:19.145 --> 00:00:22.146
But while fair officials worried 
about the pigs,

00:00:22.146 --> 00:00:27.746
the Maryland department of health was 
concerned about a group of sick fairgoers.

00:00:27.746 --> 00:00:32.394
Some had pet the pigs, while others had 
merely been near their barns;

00:00:32.394 --> 00:00:37.543
but soon, 40 of these attendees would 
be diagnosed with swine flu.

00:00:37.543 --> 00:00:41.283
More often than not, sick animals 
don’t infect humans.

00:00:41.283 --> 00:00:44.713
But when they do, these 
cross-species infections,

00:00:44.713 --> 00:00:46.613
or viral host jumps,

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:50.063
have the potential to produce 
deadly epidemics.

00:00:50.063 --> 00:00:53.913
So how can pathogens from one species 
infect another,

00:00:53.913 --> 00:00:57.623
and what makes host jumps so dangerous?

00:00:57.623 --> 00:01:03.133
Viruses are a type of organic parasite 
infecting nearly all forms of life.

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:07.280
To survive and reproduce, they must move
through three stages:

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.336
contact with a susceptible host, 
infection and replication,

00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:14.726
and transmission to other individuals.

00:01:14.726 --> 00:01:18.296
As an example, let’s look 
at human influenza.

00:01:18.296 --> 00:01:21.096
First, the flu virus encounters 
a new host

00:01:21.096 --> 00:01:24.066
and makes its way into 
their respiratory tract.

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:27.486
This isn’t so difficult, but to survive 
in this new body,

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:30.505
the virus must mount a successful 
infection

00:01:30.505 --> 00:01:34.365
before it’s caught and broken down 
by an immune response.

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:35.835
To accomplish this task,

00:01:35.835 --> 00:01:40.205
viruses have evolved specific interactions
with their host species.

00:01:40.205 --> 00:01:43.380
Human flu viruses are covered in proteins

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.830
adapted to bind with matching receptors 
on human respiratory cells.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.500
Once inside a cell, the virus employs 
additional adaptations

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.459
to hijack the host cell’s reproductive 
machinery

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:59.369
and replicate its own genetic material.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.189
Now the virus only needs to suppress
or evade the host’s immune system

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.326
long enough to replicate to sufficient 
levels and infect more cells.

00:02:08.326 --> 00:02:12.166
At this point, the flu can be passed on to
its next victim

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:15.916
via any transmission 
of infected bodily fluid.

00:02:15.916 --> 00:02:20.696
However, this simple sneeze also brings 
the virus in contact with pets,

00:02:20.696 --> 00:02:23.146
plants, or even your lunch.

00:02:23.146 --> 00:02:28.686
Viruses are constantly encountering 
new species and attempting to infect them.

00:02:28.686 --> 00:02:31.185
More often than not, this ends in failure.

00:02:31.185 --> 00:02:36.635
In most cases, the genetic dissimilarity 
between the two hosts is too great.

00:02:36.635 --> 00:02:39.223
For a virus adapted to infect humans,

00:02:39.223 --> 00:02:43.483
a lettuce cell would be a foreign and 
inhospitable landscape.

00:02:43.483 --> 00:02:47.883
But there are a staggering number 
of viruses circulating in the environment,

00:02:47.883 --> 00:02:51.218
all with the potential to 
encounter new hosts.

00:02:51.218 --> 00:02:54.988
And because viruses rapidly reproduce 
by the millions,

00:02:54.988 --> 00:02:57.988
they can quickly develop random mutations.

00:02:57.988 --> 00:03:01.998
Most mutations will have no effect, 
or even prove detrimental;

00:03:01.998 --> 00:03:07.808
but a small proportion may enable the 
pathogen to better infect a new species.

00:03:07.808 --> 00:03:12.878
The odds of winning this destructive 
genetic lottery increase over time,

00:03:12.878 --> 00:03:17.688
or if the new species is closely related 
to the virus’ usual host.

00:03:17.688 --> 00:03:20.383
For a virus adapted to another mammal,

00:03:20.383 --> 00:03:24.473
infecting a human might just take 
a few lucky mutations.

00:03:24.473 --> 00:03:26.958
And a virus adapted to chimpanzees,

00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:32.918
one of our closest genetic relatives,
might barely require any changes at all.

00:03:32.918 --> 00:03:35.588
It takes more than time and genetic 
similarity

00:03:35.588 --> 00:03:37.908
for a host jump to be successful.

00:03:37.908 --> 00:03:42.338
Some viruses come equipped to easily 
infect a new host’s cells,

00:03:42.338 --> 00:03:45.730
but are then unable to evade 
an immune response.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.530
Others might have a difficult time 
transmitting to new hosts.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.880
For example, they might make the host’s 
blood contagious,

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.510
but not their saliva.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.510
However, once a host jump reaches 
the transmission stage,

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.180
the virus becomes much more dangerous.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.620
Now gestating within two hosts,

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.780
the pathogen has twice the odds of 
mutating into a more successful virus.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.690
And each new host increases 
the potential for a full-blown epidemic.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.030
Virologists are constantly looking for 
mutations

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.370
that might make viruses such as influenza
more likely to jump.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.294
However, predicting the next potential 
epidemic is a major challenge.

00:04:26.294 --> 00:04:31.294
There’s a huge diversity of viruses 
that we’re only just beginning to uncover.

00:04:31.294 --> 00:04:35.221
Researchers are tirelessly studying the 
biology of these pathogens.

00:04:35.221 --> 00:04:39.371
And by monitoring populations to quickly
identify new outbreaks,

00:04:39.371 --> 00:04:44.917
they can develop vaccines and containment
protocols to stop these deadly diseases.
