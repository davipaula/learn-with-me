00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:15.924
Olive oil is 100% fat;

00:00:15.924 --> 00:00:16.964
there's nothing else in it.

00:00:16.964 --> 00:00:18.232
Pancake mix, on the other hand,

00:00:18.232 --> 00:00:20.489
is only about 11% fat.

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.761
And, yet, olive oil is good for you,

00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:24.931
and pancake mix is not.

00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:26.312
Why is that?

00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:28.478
As it turns out,

00:00:28.478 --> 00:00:29.889
the amount of fat we eat

00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:30.931
doesn't impact our weight

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:31.858
or our cholesterol

00:00:31.858 --> 00:00:33.064
or our risk of heart disease

00:00:33.064 --> 00:00:35.924
nearly as much as what kind of fat we eat.

00:00:35.924 --> 00:00:37.123
But let's back up:

00:00:37.123 --> 00:00:39.347
What is fat?

00:00:39.347 --> 00:00:40.925
If we were to zoom in on a salmon,

00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:42.003
which is a fatty fish,

00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:42.823
past the organs,

00:00:42.823 --> 00:00:43.613
past the tissues,

00:00:43.613 --> 00:00:45.329
into the cells,

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.421
we would see that the stuff we call fat

00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:50.626
is actually made up of molecules called triglycerides,

00:00:50.626 --> 00:00:52.545
and they are not all alike.

00:00:52.545 --> 00:00:53.629
Here's one example.

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.730
Those three carbons on the left, that's glycerol.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.262
Now, you can think of that as the backbone

00:00:57.262 --> 00:00:59.635
that holds the rest of the molecule together.

00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:00.929
The three long chains on the right

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:02.379
are called fatty acids,

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.273
and it's subtle differences in the structures of these chains

00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:06.783
that determine whether a fat is,

00:01:06.783 --> 00:01:08.938
let's say, solid or liquid;

00:01:08.938 --> 00:01:11.143
whether or not it goes rancid quickly;

00:01:11.143 --> 00:01:15.236
and, most importantly, how good or how bad it is for you.

00:01:15.236 --> 00:01:17.024
Let's take a look at some of these differences.

00:01:17.024 --> 00:01:18.075
One is length.

00:01:18.075 --> 00:01:20.160
Fatty acids can be short or long.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.414
Another, more important difference

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:24.280
is the type of bond between the carbon atoms.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.914
Some fatty acids have only single bonds.

00:01:26.914 --> 00:01:29.831
Others have both single and double bonds.

00:01:29.831 --> 00:01:31.354
Fatty acids with only single bonds

00:01:31.354 --> 00:01:32.834
are called saturated,

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:34.619
and those with one or more double bonds

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.667
are called unsaturated.

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:39.256
Now, most unsaturated fats are good for you,

00:01:39.256 --> 00:01:42.090
while saturated fats are bad for you in excess.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.713
For saturated fats, the story pretty much ends there

00:01:44.713 --> 00:01:47.120
but not for unsaturated fats.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.831
The double bonds in these molecules

00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:50.515
have a kind of weird property;

00:01:50.515 --> 00:01:52.139
they're rigid.

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:54.062
So, that means there are two ways

00:01:54.062 --> 00:01:55.883
to arrange every double bond.

00:01:55.883 --> 00:01:57.005
The first is like this,

00:01:57.005 --> 00:01:58.902
where both hydrogens are on same side

00:01:58.902 --> 00:02:00.824
and both carbons are on the same side.

00:02:00.824 --> 00:02:02.648
The second way is like this.

00:02:02.648 --> 00:02:04.193
Now the hydrogens and carbons

00:02:04.193 --> 00:02:06.718
are on opposite sides of the double bond.

00:02:06.718 --> 00:02:08.326
Now, even though both of these molecules

00:02:08.326 --> 00:02:10.826
are made up of exactly the same building blocks,

00:02:10.826 --> 00:02:13.329
they are two completely different substances,

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.468
and they behave completely differently inside of us.

00:02:16.468 --> 00:02:18.972
The configuration on the left is called CIS,

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.376
which you've probably never heard of.

00:02:20.376 --> 00:02:22.084
The one of the right is called TRANS,

00:02:22.084 --> 00:02:24.713
and you probably have heard of trans fats before.

00:02:24.713 --> 00:02:25.883
They don't go rancid,

00:02:25.883 --> 00:02:27.843
they're more stable during deep frying,

00:02:27.843 --> 00:02:29.817
and they can change the texture of foods

00:02:29.817 --> 00:02:31.806
in ways that other fats just can't.

00:02:31.806 --> 00:02:34.097
They're also terrible for your health,

00:02:34.097 --> 00:02:35.974
by far worse than saturated fat,

00:02:35.974 --> 00:02:38.019
even though technically they're a type

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.978
of unsaturated fat.

00:02:39.978 --> 00:02:41.321
Now, I know that seems crazy,

00:02:41.321 --> 00:02:42.517
but your body doesn't care

00:02:42.517 --> 00:02:44.656
what a molecule looks like on paper.

00:02:44.656 --> 00:02:46.575
All that matters is the 3-D shape

00:02:46.575 --> 00:02:47.694
where the molecule fits,

00:02:47.694 --> 00:02:48.406
where it doesn't,

00:02:48.406 --> 00:02:50.990
and what pathways it interferes with.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.950
So, how do you know if a food

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.827
has trans fat in it?

00:02:53.827 --> 00:02:55.012
Well, the only sure way to know

00:02:55.012 --> 00:02:56.084
is if you see the words,

00:02:56.084 --> 00:02:59.255
"partially hydrogenated" in the ingredients list.

00:02:59.255 --> 00:03:02.034
Don't let nutrition labels or advertising fool you.

00:03:02.034 --> 00:03:04.090
The FDA allows manufacturers to claim

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.759
that their products contain

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:08.004
"0" grams of trans fat

00:03:08.004 --> 00:03:12.635
even if they actually have up to half a gram per serving.

00:03:12.635 --> 00:03:14.104
But there are no hard and fast rules

00:03:14.104 --> 00:03:15.683
about how small a serving can be,

00:03:15.683 --> 00:03:18.730
and, that means, you'll have to rely on seeing those key words,

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.005
partially hydrogenated,

00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:22.858
because that's how trans fats are made,

00:03:22.858 --> 00:03:25.776
by partially hydrogenating unsaturated fats.

00:03:25.776 --> 00:03:28.967
So, let's go back to our olive oil and pancake mix from before.

00:03:28.967 --> 00:03:31.609
Olive oil is 100% fat.

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.339
Pancake mix is only 11% fat.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:37.205
But olive oil is mostly unsaturated fat,

00:03:37.205 --> 00:03:39.840
and it has no trans fat at all.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.001
On the other hand, more than half the fat

00:03:42.001 --> 00:03:45.008
in pancake mix is either saturated or trans fat.

00:03:45.008 --> 00:03:47.339
And, so, even though olive oil has 10 times

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:49.133
as much fat as pancake mix,

00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:50.593
it's healthy for you,

00:03:50.593 --> 00:03:52.386
whereas pancake mix is not.

00:03:52.386 --> 00:03:54.180
Now, I'm not trying to pick on pancake mix.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.264
There are lots of foods

00:03:55.264 --> 00:03:57.183
with this type of fat profile.

00:03:57.183 --> 00:03:58.409
The point is this:

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.103
It's not how much fat you eat,

00:04:00.103 --> 00:04:01.795
it's what kind of fat.

00:04:01.795 --> 00:04:04.610
And what makes a particular fat healthy or unhealthy

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.611
is its shape.
