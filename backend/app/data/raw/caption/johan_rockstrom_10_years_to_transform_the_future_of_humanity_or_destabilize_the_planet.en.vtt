00:00:13.603 --> 00:00:16.178
(Beeps)

00:00:16.202 --> 00:00:17.917
[Countdown]

00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:19.318
(Clapboard claps)

00:00:20.317 --> 00:00:23.806
Ten years is a long time
for us humans on earth.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.441
Ten turns around the sun.

00:00:26.465 --> 00:00:28.996
When I was on the TED stage a decade ago,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.255
I talked about planetary boundaries

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.126
that keep our planet in a state
that allowed humanity to prosper.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.256
The main point is that
once you transgress one,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.486
the risks start multiplying.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.416
The planetary boundaries
are all deeply connected,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.856
but climate, alongside biodiversity,
are core boundaries.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.288
They impact on all others.

00:00:50.312 --> 00:00:53.906
Back then we really
thought we had more time.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.476
The warning lights were on, absolutely,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.766
but no unstoppable change
had been triggered.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.846
Since my talk, we have increasing evidence

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.551
that we are rapidly moving away

00:01:04.575 --> 00:01:07.836
from the safe operating
space for humanity on earth.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.412
Climate has reached a global crisis point.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.095
We have now had 10 years
of record-breaking climate extremes:

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.906
fires blaze in Australia,
Siberia, California and the Amazon,

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.676
floods in China, Bangladesh and India.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.606
We're now enduring heat waves
across the entire northern hemisphere.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.436
We risk crossing tipping points

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.166
that shift the planet
from being our best resilient friend,

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.696
dampening our impacts,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.943
to start working against us,
amplifying the heat.

00:01:37.967 --> 00:01:42.373
For the first time, we are forced
to consider the real risk

00:01:42.397 --> 00:01:45.856
of destabilizing the entire planet.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.296
Our children can see this.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.986
They are walking out of school
to demand action,

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.376
looking with disbelief
at our inability to deviate away

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.186
from potentially catastrophic risks.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.806
The next 10 years, to 2030,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.716
must see the most profound transformation
the world has ever known.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.720
This is our mission.

00:02:06.744 --> 00:02:08.944
This is the countdown.

00:02:08.968 --> 00:02:10.436
(Clock ticks)

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.226
When my scientific colleagues
summarized, about a decade ago,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.649
for the first time,

00:02:15.673 --> 00:02:18.346
the state of knowledge
on climate tipping points,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.266
just one place had strong evidence
that it was on a serious downward spiral.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.508
Arctic sea ice.
(Water sounds)

00:02:26.532 --> 00:02:29.387
Other tipping points were long way off --

00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:32.362
50 or 100 turns around the sun.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.078
Just last year we revisited these systems,

00:02:36.102 --> 00:02:39.416
and I got the shock of my career.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.236
We are only a few decades away
from an Arctic without sea ice in summer.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.286
In Siberia, permafrost
is now thawing at dramatic scales.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.136
Greenland is losing
trillions of tons of ice

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.639
and may be approaching a tipping point.

00:02:53.663 --> 00:02:55.102
The great forests of the North

00:02:55.126 --> 00:02:59.146
are burning with plumes of smoke
the size of Europe.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.266
The Atlantic ocean circulation is slowing.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.257
The Amazon rainforest is weakening

00:03:04.281 --> 00:03:07.730
and may start emitting carbon
within 15 years.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.416
Half of the coral
of the Great Barrier Reef has died.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.230
West Antarctica may have crossed
the tipping point already today.

00:03:16.254 --> 00:03:20.404
And now, the most solid
of glaciers on earth, East Antarctica,

00:03:20.428 --> 00:03:23.436
parts of it are becoming unstable.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:29.866
Nine out of the 15 big biophysical systems
that regulate climate are now on the move,

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.803
showing worrying signs of decline

00:03:31.827 --> 00:03:34.730
and potentially
approaching tipping points.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.199
Tipping points bring three threats.

00:03:38.223 --> 00:03:40.136
First, sea level rise.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.966
We can already expect
up to one meter this century.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.656
This will endanger the homes
of 200 million people.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.403
But when we add the melting ice
from Antarctica and Greenland

00:03:51.427 --> 00:03:52.676
into the equation,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.376
this might lead to a two meter rise.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.146
But it won't stop there,
it will keep on getting worse.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.266
Second, if our carbon stores
like permafrost and forest

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.246
flip to belching carbon,

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.546
then this makes the job of stabilizing
temperatures so much harder.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.876
And third, these systems
are all linked like dominoes:

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.115
If you cross one tipping point,
you lurch closer to others.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.706
Let's stop for a moment
and look at where we are.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.416
The foundation of our civilization
is a stable climate

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.383
and a rich diversity of life.

00:04:27.407 --> 00:04:30.906
Everything, I mean everything,
is based on this.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.356
Civilization has thrived
in a Goldilocks zone:

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.887
not too hot, not too cold.

00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:41.727
This is what we have had for 10,000 years
since we left the last ice age.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.354
Let's zoom out a little here.

00:04:44.378 --> 00:04:46.286
Three million years --

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.712
temperatures have never broken through
the two degrees Celsius limit.

00:04:51.108 --> 00:04:54.332
Earth has self-regulated
within a very narrow range

00:04:54.356 --> 00:04:56.916
of plus two degrees
in a warm interglacial,

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.918
minus four degrees, deep ice age.

00:04:59.942 --> 00:05:01.846
Now, we are following a path

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.021
that would take us
to a three to four degree world

00:05:05.045 --> 00:05:06.986
in just three generations.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.815
We would be rewinding the climate clock,
not one million, not two million,

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:12.926
but five to 10 million years.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.870
We are drifting towards hot-house earth.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.526
For each one degree rise,

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.662
one billion people will be forced
to live in conditions

00:05:20.686 --> 00:05:24.266
that we today largely
consider uninhabitable.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.136
This is not a climate emergency,
it is a planetary emergency.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.826
My fear is not that Earth
will fall over a cliff

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.016
on the 1st of January, 2030.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.450
My fear is that we press unstoppable
buttons in the Earth system.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.696
What happens in the next 10 years

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.526
will likely determine the state
of the planet we hand over

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.526
for future generations.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.366
Our children have every
reason to be alarmed.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.846
We need to get serious
about stabilizing our planet.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.806
Two frontiers will guide
this transformation.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.636
The first one is in science.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.446
Here's a new equation
for a sustainable planet:

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.506
planetary boundaries plus global commons

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.999
equals planetary stewardship.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.126
We need to a safe corridor for humanity

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.616
to allow us all to become stewards
of the entire planet,

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.334
not to save the planet but to provide
a good future for all people.

00:06:20.358 --> 00:06:22.876
And the second frontier is in society.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.656
We need a new economic logic
based on well-being.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.936
We are now in a position
to provide science-based targets

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.690
for all global commons for all companies
and cities in the world.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.333
First task, we need to cut
global emissions by half by 2030

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:42.026
and reach net-zero by 2050 or sooner.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.477
This means decarbonizing
the big systems that run our lives:

00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:48.456
energy, industry, transport, buildings.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.656
The fossil fuel era is over.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.196
We need to transform agriculture
from a source of emissions

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.574
to a store of carbon,

00:06:55.598 --> 00:06:58.966
and critically, we must
protect our oceans and land,

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.403
the natural ecosystems
that absorb half of our emissions.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.376
The good news is, we can do this.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.526
We have the knowledge.
We have the technology.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.427
We know it makes social
and economic sense.

00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:18.806
And when we succeed,
we can all take lungfuls of fresh air.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.676
We will be saying hello
to healthy lifestyles

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.789
and resilient economies in livable cities.

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:29.844
We are all on this journey
around the sun together.

00:07:29.868 --> 00:07:32.340
This is our only home.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:38.150
This is our mission:
to protect our children's future.

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.113
Thank you.

00:07:40.847 --> 00:07:42.212
