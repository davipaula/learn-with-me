00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:11.487
On an auspicious day 
in November of 1986,

00:00:11.487 --> 00:00:15.467
5 Australian miners climbed Lunatic Hill—

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:20.047
so named for the mental state 
anyone would be in to dig there.

00:00:20.047 --> 00:00:24.995
While their competitors searched 
for opals at a depth of 2 to 5 meters,

00:00:24.995 --> 00:00:29.953
the Lunatic Hill Syndicate bored 
20 meters into the earth.

00:00:29.953 --> 00:00:32.741
And for their audacity, the earth
rewarded them

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:36.371
with a fist-sized, record breaking opal.

00:00:36.371 --> 00:00:39.586
They named it the Halley’s Comet opal,

00:00:39.586 --> 00:00:45.216
after the much larger rocky, icy body
flying by the earth at that time.

00:00:45.216 --> 00:00:50.641
The Halley’s Comet opal is a marvel,
but its uniqueness is, paradoxically,

00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:53.701
the most usual thing about it.

00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:57.051
While diamonds, rubies, emeralds,
and other precious stones

00:00:57.051 --> 00:00:59.921
are often indistinguishably similar,

00:00:59.921 --> 00:01:02.521
no two opals look the same,

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:06.554
thanks to a characteristic 
called "play of color."

00:01:06.554 --> 00:01:10.094
This shimmering, dazzling, dancing
display of light

00:01:10.094 --> 00:01:14.915
comes about from a confluence 
of chemistry, geology, and optics

00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:20.053
that define opals from their earliest
moments, deep underground.

00:01:20.053 --> 00:01:25.989
It’s there that an opal begins its life
as something surprisingly abundant: water.

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:29.339
Trickling down through gaps 
in soil and rock,

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:33.339
water flows through sandstone, limestone,
and basalt,

00:01:33.339 --> 00:01:38.063
picking up a microscopic compound
called silicon dioxide.

00:01:38.063 --> 00:01:43.789
This silica-enriched water enters
the voids inside pieces of volcanic rock,

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.123
prehistoric river beds, wood 
and even the bones of ancient creatures.

00:01:49.123 --> 00:01:52.293
Gradually, the water starts to evaporate,

00:01:52.293 --> 00:01:55.253
and the silica-solution begins
forming a gel,

00:01:55.253 --> 00:01:59.783
within which millions of silica spheres
form layer by layer

00:01:59.783 --> 00:02:02.603
as a series of concentric shells.

00:02:02.603 --> 00:02:06.737
The gel ultimately hardens 
into a glass-like material,

00:02:06.737 --> 00:02:10.507
and the spheres settle
into a lattice structure.

00:02:10.507 --> 00:02:14.487
The vast majority of the time,
this structure is haphazard,

00:02:14.487 --> 00:02:19.691
resulting in common, or potch, opals
with unremarkable exteriors.

00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:24.445
The tiny, mesmerizing percentage 
we call precious opals

00:02:24.445 --> 00:02:30.557
have regions where silica beads
of uniform size form orderly arrays.

00:02:30.557 --> 00:02:35.427
So why do those structures produce
such vibrant displays?

00:02:35.427 --> 00:02:40.780
The answer lies in a principle of wave
physics called interference.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.123
For the sake of simplicity,

00:02:42.123 --> 00:02:45.133
let’s look at what happens 
when a single color of light—

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:50.516
green, with a wavelength of 500
nanometers— hits a precious opal.

00:02:50.516 --> 00:02:53.826
The green light will scatter throughout
the gemstone

00:02:53.826 --> 00:02:57.136
and reflect back with varying intensities—

00:02:57.136 --> 00:03:01.311
from most angles suffused, 
from some entirely dimmed,

00:03:01.311 --> 00:03:04.241
and others dazzlingly bright.

00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:09.592
What’s happening is, some of the green
light reflects off of the top layer.

00:03:09.592 --> 00:03:12.472
Some reflects off of the layer below that.

00:03:12.472 --> 00:03:13.722
And so on.

00:03:13.722 --> 00:03:18.613
When the additional distance it travels
from one layer to the next, and back,

00:03:18.613 --> 00:03:25.555
is a multiple of the wavelength—
such as 500 or 1000 extra nanometers—

00:03:25.555 --> 00:03:29.894
the crests and valleys of the waves 
match each other.

00:03:29.894 --> 00:03:33.438
This phenomenon is called 
constructive interference,

00:03:33.438 --> 00:03:37.558
and it amplifies the wave,
producing a brighter color.

00:03:37.558 --> 00:03:40.958
So if you position your eye 
at the correct angle,

00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:45.830
the green light reflecting from many
layers adds together.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.010
Shift the angle just a bit,

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.730
and you change the distance 
the light travels between layers.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.358
Change it enough, and you’ll reach a point
where the crests match the valleys,

00:03:56.358 --> 00:04:02.729
making the waves cancel each other out—
that’s destructive interference.

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:05.709
Different colors have different
wavelengths,

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.879
which translates to varying distances 
they have to travel

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.229
to constructively interfere.

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:16.070
That’s why colors roughly correspond
to silica bead sizes.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:23.102
The spaces between 210 nanometer beads
are just right to amplify blue light.

00:04:23.102 --> 00:04:25.742
For red light, with its long wavelengths,

00:04:25.742 --> 00:04:29.492
the silica beads must be close
to 300 nanometers.

00:04:29.492 --> 00:04:33.182
Those take a very long time to form,
and because of that,

00:04:33.182 --> 00:04:36.342
red is the rarest opal color.

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:39.360
The differences in the arrangements 
of the gel lattices

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.230
within a particular stone
result in a wide range of color patterns—

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:50.490
everything from broad flash 
to pin-fire to the ultra-rare harlequin.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.410
The circumstances that lead 
to the formation of precious opal

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.340
are so uncommon that they only occur
in a handful of places.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.400
About 95% come from Australia,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.047
where an ancient inland sea
created the perfect conditions.

00:05:07.047 --> 00:05:13.167
It was there that the Halley’s Comet opal
formed some 100 million years ago.

00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:17.284
Which raises the question: 
in the next 100 million years,

00:05:17.284 --> 00:05:20.864
silica-rich water will percolate 
through the nooks and crannies

00:05:20.864 --> 00:05:24.989
of some of the discarded artifacts 
of human civilization.

00:05:24.989 --> 00:05:29.110
What opalescent plays of light 
will one day radiate

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.594
from the things we forget in the darkness?
