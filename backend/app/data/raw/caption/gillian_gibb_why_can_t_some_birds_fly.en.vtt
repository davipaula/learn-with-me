00:00:06.715 --> 00:00:09.915
In the lush rainforests of Australia, birds roost

00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:13.595
in the low branches and amble across the forest floor,

00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:16.395
enjoying the shade and tropical fruits.

00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:18.625
But the jungle isn’t theirs alone.

00:00:18.625 --> 00:00:21.005
A dingo is prowling in the shadows,

00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:24.095
and fruit won’t satisfy his appetite.

00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:26.125
The birds flee to safety

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:27.985
all but the cassowary,

00:00:27.985 --> 00:00:30.405
who can’t clear the ground on her puny wings.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:34.405
Instead, she attacks, sending the dingo running for cover

00:00:34.405 --> 00:00:38.035
with one swipe of her razor-sharp toe claws.

00:00:38.035 --> 00:00:40.715
The cassowary is one of approximately 60

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:43.105
living species of flightless birds.

00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:46.295
These earthbound avians live all over the world,

00:00:46.295 --> 00:00:48.375
from the Australian outback to the

00:00:48.375 --> 00:00:51.025
African savanna to Antarctic shores.

00:00:51.025 --> 00:00:53.425
They include some species of duck and all

00:00:53.425 --> 00:00:56.195
species of penguin, secretive swamp dwellers

00:00:56.195 --> 00:01:00.515
and speedy ostriches, giant emus, and tiny kiwis.

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:04.325
Though the common ancestor of all modern birds could fly,

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:06.955
many different bird species have independently

00:01:06.955 --> 00:01:08.825
lost their flight.

00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:10.835
Flight can have incredible benefits,

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:13.545
especially for escaping predators, hunting,

00:01:13.545 --> 00:01:15.665
and traveling long distances.

00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:18.435
But it also has high costs:

00:01:18.435 --> 00:01:20.595
it consumes huge amounts of energy

00:01:20.595 --> 00:01:23.845
and limits body size and weight.

00:01:23.845 --> 00:01:26.095
A bird that doesn’t fly conserves energy,

00:01:26.095 --> 00:01:28.655
so it may be able to survive on a scarcer

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:32.535
or less nutrient-rich food source than one that flies.

00:01:32.535 --> 00:01:35.226
The Takahe of New Zealand, for example,

00:01:35.226 --> 00:01:36.986
lives almost entirely on the

00:01:36.986 --> 00:01:40.466
soft base of alpine grasses.

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.936
For birds that nest or feed on the ground,

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:45.516
this predisposition to flightlessness

00:01:45.516 --> 00:01:47.546
can be even stronger.

00:01:47.546 --> 00:01:49.976
When a bird species doesn’t face

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:53.356
specific pressures to fly, it can stop flying

00:01:53.356 --> 00:01:55.906
in as quickly as a few generations.

00:01:55.906 --> 00:01:58.536
Then, over thousands or millions of years,

00:01:58.536 --> 00:02:01.946
the birds’ bodies change to match this new behavior.

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:04.736
Their bones, once hollow to minimize weight,

00:02:04.736 --> 00:02:06.026
become dense.

00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:08.526
Their sturdy feathers turn to fluff.

00:02:08.526 --> 00:02:09.876
Their wings shrink,

00:02:09.876 --> 00:02:13.116
and in some cases disappear entirely.

00:02:13.116 --> 00:02:15.896
And the keel-like protrusion on their sternums,

00:02:15.896 --> 00:02:19.576
where the flight muscles attach, shrinks or disappears,

00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:22.946
except in penguins, who repurpose their flight muscles

00:02:22.946 --> 00:02:25.296
and keels for swimming.

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:27.716
Most often, flightlessness evolves after

00:02:27.716 --> 00:02:29.976
a bird species flies to an island

00:02:29.976 --> 00:02:31.916
where there are no predators.

00:02:31.916 --> 00:02:35.336
As long as these predator-free circumstances last,

00:02:35.336 --> 00:02:37.666
the birds thrive, but they are vulnerable

00:02:37.666 --> 00:02:39.506
to changes in their environment.

00:02:39.506 --> 00:02:41.746
For instance, human settlers bring dogs,

00:02:41.746 --> 00:02:45.106
cats, and stowaway rodents to islands.

00:02:45.106 --> 00:02:47.586
These animals often prey on flightless birds

00:02:47.586 --> 00:02:49.936
and can drive them to extinction.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:53.416
In New Zealand, stoats introduced by European settlers

00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:56.726
have threatened many native species of flightless bird.

00:02:56.726 --> 00:02:59.646
Some have gone extinct while others are endangered.

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:02.486
So in spite of the energy-saving advantages

00:03:02.486 --> 00:03:05.566
of flightlessness, many flightless bird species have

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:10.036
only a short run before going the way of the dodo.

00:03:10.036 --> 00:03:12.396
But a few flightless birds have survived on

00:03:12.396 --> 00:03:15.226
mainlands alongside predators aplenty.

00:03:15.226 --> 00:03:17.866
Unlike most small flightless species that

00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:20.386
come and go quickly, these giants have been

00:03:20.386 --> 00:03:23.256
flightless for tens of millions of years.

00:03:23.256 --> 00:03:25.986
Their ancestors appeared around the same time

00:03:25.986 --> 00:03:28.566
as the first small mammals, and they were probably

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:31.226
able to survive because they were evolving—

00:03:31.226 --> 00:03:33.446
and growing—at the same time

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:36.036
as their mammalian predators.

00:03:36.036 --> 00:03:39.136
Most of these birds, like emus and ostriches,

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:41.836
ballooned in size, weighing hundreds of

00:03:41.836 --> 00:03:43.956
pounds more than wings can lift.

00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:46.766
Their legs grew thick, their feet sturdy,

00:03:46.766 --> 00:03:49.276
and newly developed thigh muscles turned

00:03:49.276 --> 00:03:52.036
them into formidable runners.

00:03:52.036 --> 00:03:54.116
Though they no longer use them to fly,

00:03:54.116 --> 00:03:55.986
many of these birds repurpose

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:57.686
their wings for other means.

00:03:57.686 --> 00:04:00.226
They can be spotted tucking their heads beneath them

00:04:00.226 --> 00:04:02.996
for warmth, flashing them at prospective mates,

00:04:02.996 --> 00:04:05.876
sheltering eggs with them, or even using them

00:04:05.876 --> 00:04:08.646
to steer as they charge across the plains.

00:04:08.646 --> 00:04:12.646
They may be flightless, but they’re still winging it.
