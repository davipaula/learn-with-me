00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:16.643
I am obsessed with forming
healthy communities,

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:18.934
and that's why I started Twitch --

00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:22.393
to help people watch other people
play video games on the internet.

00:00:22.417 --> 00:00:23.726
(Laughter)

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.768
Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.351
(Laughter)

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:29.059
So in seriousness,

00:00:29.083 --> 00:00:32.708
video games and communities
truly are quite related.

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:36.434
From our early human history,

00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:40.018
we made our entertainment
together in small tribes.

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:42.268
We shared stories around the campfire,

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:44.893
we sang together, we danced together.

00:00:44.917 --> 00:00:48.750
Our earliest entertainment
was both shared and interactive.

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:53.726
It wasn't until pretty recently
on the grand scale of human history

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.309
that interactivity took a back seat

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.809
and broadcast entertainment took over.

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:04.434
Radio and records brought music
into our vehicles, into our homes.

00:01:04.458 --> 00:01:09.643
TV and VHS brought sports and drama
into our living rooms.

00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:14.226
This access to broadcast entertainment
was unprecedented.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.851
It gave people amazing content
around the globe.

00:01:17.875 --> 00:01:21.208
It created a shared culture
for millions of people.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:27.726
And now, if you want to go watch
or listen to Mozart,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.625
you don't have to buy an incredibly
expensive ticket and find an orchestra.

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:34.268
And if you like to sing --

00:01:34.292 --> 00:01:37.518
(Sings) I can show you the world --

00:01:37.542 --> 00:01:41.875
then you have something in common
with people around the world.

00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:46.476
But with this amazing access,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.958
we allowed for a separation
between creator and consumer,

00:01:51.917 --> 00:01:56.208
and the relationship between the two
became much more one-way.

00:01:58.417 --> 00:02:04.393
We wound up in a world where we had
a smaller class of professional creators

00:02:04.417 --> 00:02:08.226
and most of us became spectators,

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.351
and as a result it became far easier
for us to enjoy that content alone.

00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:16.101
There's a trend counteracting this:

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:17.393
scarcity.

00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:22.184
So, Vienna in the 1900s,
was famous for its café culture.

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:25.976
And one of the big drivers
of that café culture

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.434
was expensive newspapers
that were hard to get,

00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:30.768
and as a result,

00:02:30.792 --> 00:02:34.393
people would go to the café
and read the shared copy there.

00:02:34.417 --> 00:02:35.851
And once they're in the cafe,

00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:39.018
they meet the other people
also reading the same newspaper,

00:02:39.042 --> 00:02:41.601
they converse, they exchange ideas

00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:42.917
and they form a community.

00:02:44.542 --> 00:02:46.309
In a similar way,

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:49.059
TV and cable used to be more expensive,

00:02:49.083 --> 00:02:51.893
and so you might not watch
the game at home.

00:02:51.917 --> 00:02:53.976
Instead you'd go to the local bar

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.458
and cheer along with
your fellow sports fans there.

00:02:57.458 --> 00:03:02.125
But as the price of media continues
to fall over time thanks to technology,

00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:08.125
this shared necessity that used to bring
our communities together falls away.

00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:14.143
We have so many amazing options
for our entertainment,

00:03:14.167 --> 00:03:19.917
and yet it's easier than ever for us
to wind up consuming those options alone.

00:03:21.125 --> 00:03:23.292
Our communities
are bearing the consequences.

00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:25.393
For example,

00:03:25.417 --> 00:03:28.601
the number of people who report
having at least two close friends

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.250
is at an all-time low.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.101
I believe that one of the major
contributing causes to this

00:03:38.125 --> 00:03:43.042
is that our entertainment today
allows us to be separate.

00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:50.101
There is one trend reversing
this atomization of our society:

00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:52.708
modern multiplayer video games.

00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:58.393
Games are like a shared campfire.

00:03:58.417 --> 00:04:01.083
They're both interactive and connecting.

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:05.309
Now these campfires
may have beautiful animations,

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:06.976
heroic quests,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.476
occasionally too many loot boxes,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.268
but games today are very different

00:04:12.292 --> 00:04:14.750
than the solitary activity
of 20 years ago.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.476
They're deeply complex,

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.434
they're more intellectually stimulating,

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:21.958
and most of all,
they're intrinsically social.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.518
One of the recent breakout genres
exemplifying this change

00:04:27.542 --> 00:04:29.642
is the battle royale.

00:04:29.666 --> 00:04:35.101
100 people parachute onto an island
in a last-man-standing competition.

00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:38.268
Think of it as being
kind of like "American Idol,"

00:04:38.292 --> 00:04:41.792
but with a lot more fighting
and a lot less Simon Cowell.

00:04:43.542 --> 00:04:45.143
You may have heard of "Fortnite,"

00:04:45.167 --> 00:04:48.851
which is a breakout example
of the battle royale genre,

00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:53.018
which has been played by more
than 250 million people around the world.

00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:55.143
It's everyone from kids
in your neighborhood

00:04:55.167 --> 00:04:57.518
to Drake and Ellen DeGeneres.

00:04:57.542 --> 00:05:01.101
2.3 billion people in the world
play video games.

00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:06.143
Early games like "Tetris" and "Mario"
may have been simple puzzles or quests,

00:05:06.167 --> 00:05:09.059
but with the rise of arcades
and then internet play,

00:05:09.083 --> 00:05:13.601
and now massively multiplayer games
of huge, thriving online communities,

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:16.893
games have emerged
as the one form of entertainment

00:05:16.917 --> 00:05:20.667
where consumption truly requires
human connection.

00:05:21.667 --> 00:05:23.934
So this brings us to streaming.

00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:27.393
Why do people stream themselves
playing video games?

00:05:27.417 --> 00:05:31.518
And why do hundreds of millions
of people around the world

00:05:31.542 --> 00:05:33.375
congregate to watch them?

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:37.518
I want you all the imagine for second --

00:05:37.542 --> 00:05:40.059
imagine you land on an alien planet,

00:05:40.083 --> 00:05:43.226
and on this planet,
there's a giant green rectangle.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.101
And in this green rectangle,

00:05:45.125 --> 00:05:46.518
aliens in matching outfits

00:05:46.542 --> 00:05:49.143
are trying to push a checkered
sphere between two posts

00:05:49.167 --> 00:05:50.559
using only their feet.

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:51.893
It's pretty evenly matched,

00:05:51.917 --> 00:05:54.726
so the ball is just going back and forth,

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.559
but there's hundreds of millions
of people watching from home anyway,

00:05:58.583 --> 00:06:02.559
and cheering and getting excited
and engaged right along with them.

00:06:02.583 --> 00:06:05.351
Now I grew up watching sports with my dad,

00:06:05.375 --> 00:06:09.434
so I get why soccer
is entertaining and engaging.

00:06:09.458 --> 00:06:12.351
But if you don't watch sports,

00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:15.184
maybe you like watching
"Dancing with the Stars"

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:16.667
or you enjoy "Top Chef."

00:06:17.792 --> 00:06:20.125
Regardless, the principle is the same.

00:06:20.875 --> 00:06:23.375
If there is an activity
that you really enjoy,

00:06:24.583 --> 00:06:27.393
you're probably going to like
watching other people do it

00:06:27.417 --> 00:06:29.667
with skill and panache.

00:06:30.708 --> 00:06:33.018
It might be perplexing to an alien,

00:06:33.042 --> 00:06:35.958
but bonding over shared passion
is a human universal.

00:06:36.708 --> 00:06:43.143
So gamers grew up expecting
this live, interactive entertainment,

00:06:43.167 --> 00:06:46.268
and passive consumption
just doesn't feel as fulfilling.

00:06:46.292 --> 00:06:50.000
That's why livestreaming
has taken off with video games.

00:06:51.333 --> 00:06:56.250
Because livestreaming offers
that same kind of interactive feeling.

00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:03.309
So when you imagine
what's happening on Twitch,

00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:09.559
I don't want you to think
of a million livestreams of video games.

00:07:09.583 --> 00:07:16.684
Instead, what I want you to picture
is millions of campfires.

00:07:16.708 --> 00:07:18.393
Some of them are bonfires --

00:07:18.417 --> 00:07:22.851
huge, roaring bonfires with hundreds
of thousands of people around them.

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:25.893
Some of them are smaller,
more intimate community gatherings

00:07:25.917 --> 00:07:27.625
where everyone knows your name.

00:07:28.458 --> 00:07:32.458
Let's try taking a seat
by one of those campfires right now.

00:07:34.958 --> 00:07:36.643
Hey Cohh, how's it going?

00:07:36.667 --> 00:07:38.309
Cohh: Hey, how's it going, Emmett?

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:41.768
ES: So I'm here at TED
with about 1,000 of my closest friends,

00:07:41.792 --> 00:07:46.476
and we thought we'd come
and join you guys for a little stream.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.893
Cohh: Awesome! It's great
to hear from you guys.

00:07:48.917 --> 00:07:52.309
ES: So Cohh, can you share
with the TED audience here --

00:07:52.333 --> 00:07:56.226
what have you learned
about your community on Twitch?

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.268
Cohh: Ah, man, where to begin?

00:07:58.292 --> 00:08:00.518
I've been doing this
for over five years now,

00:08:00.542 --> 00:08:05.643
and if there's one thing that doesn't
cease to impress me on the daily,

00:08:05.667 --> 00:08:09.809
it's just kind of how incredible
this whole thing is for communication.

00:08:09.833 --> 00:08:12.684
I've been playing games
for 20 years of my life,

00:08:12.708 --> 00:08:15.684
I've led online MMO guilds for over 10,

00:08:15.708 --> 00:08:20.018
and it's the kind of thing
where there's very few places in life

00:08:20.042 --> 00:08:23.851
where you can go to meet
so many people with similar interests.

00:08:23.875 --> 00:08:25.476
I was listening in a bit earlier;

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.268
I love the campfire analogy,
I actually use a similar one.

00:08:28.292 --> 00:08:30.559
I see it all as a bunch of people
on a big couch

00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:32.476
but only one person has the controller.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.393
So it's kind of like
a "Pass the snack!" situation, you know?

00:08:35.417 --> 00:08:36.726
700 people that way --

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.518
but it's great and really it's just --

00:08:39.542 --> 00:08:43.518
ES: So Cohh, what is going on
in chat right now?

00:08:43.542 --> 00:08:45.476
Can you explain that a little bit to us?

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:49.893
Because my eyesight isn't that good
but I see a lot of emotes.

00:08:49.917 --> 00:08:52.601
Cohh: So this is my community;
this is the Cohhilition.

00:08:52.625 --> 00:08:53.933
I stream every single day.

00:08:53.957 --> 00:08:56.268
I actually just wrapped up
a 2,000-day challenge,

00:08:56.292 --> 00:09:00.268
and as such, we have developed
a pretty incredible community

00:09:00.292 --> 00:09:01.559
here in the channel.

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:03.684
Right now we have
about 6200 people with us.

00:09:03.708 --> 00:09:07.059
What you're seeing is a spam
of "Hello, TED" good-vibe emotes,

00:09:07.083 --> 00:09:09.101
love emotes,

00:09:09.125 --> 00:09:10.393
"this is awesome,"

00:09:10.417 --> 00:09:11.768
"Hi, guys," "Hi, everyone."

00:09:11.792 --> 00:09:14.476
Basically just a huge
collection of people --

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.851
huge collection of gamers

00:09:15.875 --> 00:09:18.559
that are all just experiencing
a positive event together.

00:09:18.583 --> 00:09:21.643
ES: So is there anything that --
can we poll chat?

00:09:21.667 --> 00:09:23.476
I want ask chat a question.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.809
Is there anything
that chat would like the world,

00:09:26.833 --> 00:09:29.684
and particularly these people
here with me at TED right now,

00:09:29.708 --> 00:09:33.601
to know about what they get
out of playing video games

00:09:33.625 --> 00:09:35.375
and being part of this community?

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:37.625
Cohh: Oh, wow.

00:09:38.292 --> 00:09:40.792
I am already starting to see
a lot of answers here.

00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.500
"I like the good vibes."

00:09:46.125 --> 00:09:48.500
"Best communities are on Twitch."

00:09:49.292 --> 00:09:50.583
(Laughter)

00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:53.792
"They get us through
the rough patches in life."

00:09:54.833 --> 00:09:57.601
Oh, that's a message
I definitely see a lot on Twitch,

00:09:57.625 --> 00:09:58.917
which is very good.

00:09:59.625 --> 00:10:01.226
"A very positive community,"

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.726
"a lot of positivity,"

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.101
which is pretty great.

00:10:05.125 --> 00:10:09.351
ES: So Cohh, before I get back
to my TED talk,

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:12.559
which I actually should probably
get back to doing at some point --

00:10:12.583 --> 00:10:13.851
(Laughter)

00:10:13.875 --> 00:10:16.518
Do you have anything else
that you want to share with me

00:10:16.542 --> 00:10:18.184
or any question you wanted to ask,

00:10:18.208 --> 00:10:21.601
you've always wanted
to get out there before an audience?

00:10:21.625 --> 00:10:23.351
Cohh: Honestly, not too much.

00:10:23.375 --> 00:10:25.934
I mean, I absolutely love
what you're doing right now.

00:10:25.958 --> 00:10:27.809
I think that the interactive streaming

00:10:27.833 --> 00:10:30.976
is the big unexplored frontier
of the future in entertainment,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.726
and thank you for doing
everything you're doing up there.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.518
The more people that hear
about what you do, the better --

00:10:36.542 --> 00:10:37.851
for everyone on here.

00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:39.495
ES: Awesome, Cohh. Thanks so much.

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:41.684
I'm going to get back
to giving this talk now,

00:10:41.708 --> 00:10:43.143
but we should catch up later.

00:10:43.167 --> 00:10:44.434
Cohh: Sounds great!

00:10:44.458 --> 00:10:46.958
(Applause)

00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.167
ES: So that was a new way to interact.

00:10:52.083 --> 00:10:55.476
We could influence
what happened on the stream,

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.333
we could cocreate
the experience along with him,

00:11:00.917 --> 00:11:06.250
and we really had a multiplayer experience
with chat and with Cohh.

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.976
At Twitch, we've started calling this,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.333
as a result, "multiplayer entertainment."

00:11:14.333 --> 00:11:20.601
Because going from watching a video alone
to watching a live interactive stream

00:11:20.625 --> 00:11:26.643
is similar to the difference between
going from playing a single-player game

00:11:26.667 --> 00:11:29.208
to playing a multiplayer game.

00:11:30.667 --> 00:11:35.167
Gamers are often as the forefront
of exploration in new technology.

00:11:37.833 --> 00:11:43.309
Microcomputers, for example,
were used early on for video games,

00:11:43.333 --> 00:11:49.893
and the very first handheld, digital
mass-market devices weren't cell phones,

00:11:49.917 --> 00:11:51.643
they were Gameboys ...

00:11:51.667 --> 00:11:53.268
for video games.

00:11:53.292 --> 00:11:56.393
And as a result,

00:11:56.417 --> 00:12:01.768
one way that you can get a hint
of what the future might hold

00:12:01.792 --> 00:12:06.184
is to look to this fun, interactive
sandbox of video games

00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:08.268
and ask yourself,

00:12:08.292 --> 00:12:10.268
"what are these gamers doing today?"

00:12:10.292 --> 00:12:13.559
And that might give you a hint
as to what the future is going to hold

00:12:13.583 --> 00:12:14.833
for all of us.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.976
One of the things
we're already seeing on Twitch

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.726
is multiplayer entertainment
coming to sports.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:26.768
So, Twitch and the NFL teamed up
to offer livestreaming football,

00:12:26.792 --> 00:12:30.768
but instead of network announcers
in suits streaming the game,

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:33.476
we got Twitch users to come in

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.226
and stream it themselves
on their own channel

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.643
and interact with their community

00:12:38.667 --> 00:12:41.976
and make it a real multiplayer experience.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.434
So I actually think that if you
look out into the future --

00:12:47.458 --> 00:12:52.042
only hundreds of people today
get to be sports announcers.

00:12:53.458 --> 00:12:56.476
It's a tiny, tiny number of people
who have that opportunity.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.434
But sports are about to go multiplayer,

00:13:00.458 --> 00:13:03.309
and that means that anyone
who wants to around the world

00:13:03.333 --> 00:13:08.059
is going to get the opportunity
to become a sports announcer,

00:13:08.083 --> 00:13:09.601
to give it a shot.

00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:12.809
And I think that's going to unlock
incredible amounts of new talent

00:13:12.833 --> 00:13:14.101
for all of us.

00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:17.101
And we're not going to be asking,
"Did you catch the game?"

00:13:17.125 --> 00:13:19.059
Instead, we're going to be asking,

00:13:19.083 --> 00:13:22.208
"Whose channel did you catch the game on?"

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:28.934
We already see this happening
with cooking, with singing --

00:13:28.958 --> 00:13:31.167
we even see people streaming welding.

00:13:32.292 --> 00:13:36.625
And all of this stuff is going to happen
around the metaphorical campfire.

00:13:37.667 --> 00:13:40.184
There's going to be millions
of these campfires lit

00:13:40.208 --> 00:13:41.768
over the next few years.

00:13:41.792 --> 00:13:45.018
And on every topic,

00:13:45.042 --> 00:13:47.101
you're going to be able to find a campfire

00:13:47.125 --> 00:13:51.143
that will allow you to bond
with your people around the world.

00:13:51.167 --> 00:13:52.684
For most of human history,

00:13:52.708 --> 00:13:55.518
entertainment was simply multiplayer.

00:13:55.542 --> 00:13:58.101
We sang together in person,

00:13:58.125 --> 00:14:02.101
we shared news together
in the town square in person,

00:14:02.125 --> 00:14:04.601
and somewhere along the way,

00:14:04.625 --> 00:14:09.792
that two-way conversation
turned into a one-way transmission.

00:14:10.625 --> 00:14:12.893
As someone who cares about communities,

00:14:12.917 --> 00:14:14.809
I am excited for a world

00:14:14.833 --> 00:14:19.542
where our entertainment
could connect us instead of isolating us.

00:14:21.708 --> 00:14:26.518
A world where we can bond with each other
over our shared interests

00:14:26.542 --> 00:14:29.292
and create real, strong communities.

00:14:30.458 --> 00:14:33.684
Games, streams and the interactions
they encourage,

00:14:33.708 --> 00:14:37.893
are only just beginning
to turn the wheel back

00:14:37.917 --> 00:14:42.083
to our interactive, community-rich,
multiplayer past.

00:14:43.042 --> 00:14:46.018
Thank you all for sharing
this experience here with me,

00:14:46.042 --> 00:14:48.559
and may you all find your best campfire.

00:14:48.583 --> 00:14:51.292
(Applause)
