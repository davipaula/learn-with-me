00:00:06.295 --> 00:00:08.719
Human beings are everywhere.

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.126
With settlements on every continent,

00:00:11.126 --> 00:00:14.870
we can be found in the most isolated 
corners of Earth’s jungles,

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:15.711
oceans,

00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:17.010
and tundras.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.219
Our impact is so profound,
most scientists believe

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:24.992
humanity has left a permanent mark 
on Earth’s geological record.

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:32.280
So what would happen if suddenly, 
every human on Earth disappeared?

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.957
With no one maintaining them, some
of our creations backfire immediately.

00:00:36.957 --> 00:00:40.800
Hours after we disappear,
oil refineries malfunction,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.536
producing month-long blazes at
plants like the ones in western India,

00:00:45.536 --> 00:00:47.124
the southern United States,

00:00:47.124 --> 00:00:48.948
and South Korea.

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:52.457
In underground rail systems 
like those in London,

00:00:52.457 --> 00:00:53.409
Moscow,

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:54.634
and New York City,

00:00:54.634 --> 00:01:00.525
hundreds of drainage pumps are abandoned,
flooding the tunnels in just three days.

00:01:00.525 --> 00:01:04.822
By the end of the first week,
most emergency generators have shut down,

00:01:04.822 --> 00:01:06.556
and once the fires have gone out,

00:01:06.556 --> 00:01:10.880
the earth goes dark 
for the first time in centuries.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.575
After the first catastrophic month,
changes come more gradually.

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:20.755
Within 20 years, sidewalks have been 
torn apart by weeds and tree roots.

00:01:20.755 --> 00:01:22.244
Around this time,

00:01:22.244 --> 00:01:26.363
flooded tunnels erode 
the streets above into urban rivers.

00:01:26.363 --> 00:01:27.808
In temperate climates,

00:01:27.808 --> 00:01:31.694
the cycle of seasons freezes 
and thaws these waterways,

00:01:31.694 --> 00:01:34.918
cracking pavement 
and concrete foundations.

00:01:34.918 --> 00:01:38.661
Leaking pipes cause the same reaction 
in concrete buildings,

00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:44.295
and within 200 winters, most skyscrapers 
buckle and tumble down.

00:01:44.295 --> 00:01:47.275
In cities built in river deltas 
like Houston,

00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:50.495
these buildings 
eventually wash away completely -

00:01:50.495 --> 00:01:54.214
filling nearby tributaries 
with crushed concrete.

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:57.705
Rural and suburban areas 
decay more slowly,

00:01:57.705 --> 00:02:00.332
but in largely unsurprising ways.

00:02:00.332 --> 00:02:03.849
Leaks, mold, bug 
and rodent infestations -

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:06.326
all the usual enemies of the homeowner-

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:08.469
now go uncontested.

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:14.269
Within 75 years, most houses' 
supporting beams have rotted and sagged,

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.397
and the resulting collapsed heap 
is now home to local rodents and lizards.

00:02:19.397 --> 00:02:23.315
But in this post-human world, 
“local” has a new meaning.

00:02:23.315 --> 00:02:26.097
Our cities are full of imported plants,

00:02:26.097 --> 00:02:29.580
which now run wild across 
their adopted homes.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.652
Water hyacinth coat the waterways 
of Shanghai in a thick green carpet.

00:02:34.652 --> 00:02:39.900
Poisonous giant hogweeds overgrow
the banks of London’s Thames River.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.406
Chinese Ailanthus trees burst
through New York City streets.

00:02:44.406 --> 00:02:49.031
And as sunken skyscrapers add
crumbled concrete to the new forest floor,

00:02:49.031 --> 00:02:51.607
the soil acidity plummets,

00:02:51.607 --> 00:02:55.078
potentially allowing 
new plant life to thrive.

00:02:55.078 --> 00:02:59.823
This post-human biodiversity 
extends into the animal kingdom, as well.

00:02:59.823 --> 00:03:04.134
Animals follow the unchecked 
spread of native and non-native plants,

00:03:04.134 --> 00:03:08.788
venturing into new habitats 
with the help of our leftover bridges.

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:13.486
In general, our infrastructure 
saves some animals and dooms others.

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:17.320
Cockroaches continue to thrive 
in their native tropical habitats,

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.315
but without our heating systems,

00:03:19.315 --> 00:03:24.805
their urban cousins likely freeze
and die out in just two winters.

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:28.902
And most domesticated animals 
are unable to survive without us –

00:03:28.902 --> 00:03:33.824
save for a handful of resourceful pigs, 
dogs, and feral housecats.

00:03:33.824 --> 00:03:39.033
Conversely, the reduced light pollution 
saves over a billion birds each year

00:03:39.033 --> 00:03:43.224
whose migrations were disrupted 
by blinking communication tower lights

00:03:43.224 --> 00:03:45.424
and high-tension wires.

00:03:45.424 --> 00:03:50.722
And mosquitos multiply endlessly in one
of their favorite manmade nurseries –

00:03:50.722 --> 00:03:55.111
rubber tires, which last 
for almost a thousand years.

00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:57.560
As fauna and flora flourish,

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.811
Earth’s climate slowly recovers 
from millennia of human impact.

00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:04.047
Within 35,000 years,

00:04:04.047 --> 00:04:07.394
the plant cycle removes
the last traces of lead

00:04:07.394 --> 00:04:10.889
left by the Industrial Revolution 
from Earth’s soil,

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.285
and it may take 
up to 65,000 years beyond that

00:04:14.285 --> 00:04:17.838
for CO2 to return pre-human levels.

00:04:17.838 --> 00:04:22.807
But even after several million years,
humanity’s legacy lives on.

00:04:22.807 --> 00:04:25.368
Carved in unyielding granite,

00:04:25.368 --> 00:04:30.173
America’s Mt. Rushmore 
survives for 7.2 million years.

00:04:30.173 --> 00:04:33.432
The chemical composition 
of our bronze sculptures

00:04:33.432 --> 00:04:36.703
keeps them recognizable 
for over 10 million.

00:04:36.703 --> 00:04:38.485
And buried deep underground,

00:04:38.485 --> 00:04:41.310
the remnants of cities 
built on floodplains

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.504
have been preserved in time 
as a kind of technofossil.

00:04:45.504 --> 00:04:49.960
Eventually, these traces, too, 
will be wiped from the planet’s surface.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.236
Humanity hasn’t always been here, 
and we won’t be here forever.

00:04:54.236 --> 00:04:56.527
But by investigating the world without us,

00:04:56.527 --> 00:05:00.318
perhaps we can learn more 
about the world we live in now.
