00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:17.120
It is often said that the stories
of history are written by its victors,

00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:18.456
but if this is true,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.528
what becomes of the downtrodden,

00:00:20.552 --> 00:00:23.330
and how can they ever hope
to aspire for something greater

00:00:23.354 --> 00:00:26.726
if they are never told the stories
of their own glorious pasts?

00:00:27.705 --> 00:00:31.625
Ostensibly, I stand before you
as a mere maker of clothing,

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.792
but within the folds of ancient fabrics
and modern textiles,

00:00:34.816 --> 00:00:36.466
I have found a higher calling.

00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:38.920
Through my work as a designer,

00:00:38.944 --> 00:00:42.047
I've discovered the importance
of providing representation

00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:45.013
for the marginalized members
of our society,

00:00:45.037 --> 00:00:48.330
and the importance of telling
the most vulnerable among us

00:00:48.354 --> 00:00:50.763
that they no longer have
to compromise themselves

00:00:50.787 --> 00:00:53.427
just so they can fit in
with an uncompromising majority.

00:00:54.505 --> 00:00:56.099
It turns out that fashion,

00:00:56.123 --> 00:00:58.593
a discipline many of us
consider to be trivial,

00:00:58.617 --> 00:01:02.030
can actually be a powerful tool
for dismantling bias

00:01:02.054 --> 00:01:05.633
and bolstering the self-images
of underrepresented populations.

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:10.095
My interest in using design
as a vehicle for social change

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.595
happens to be a personal one.

00:01:12.156 --> 00:01:15.334
As a Nigerian American,
I know how easily the term "African"

00:01:15.358 --> 00:01:18.620
can slip from being
an ordinary geographic descriptor

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:20.469
to becoming a pejorative.

00:01:21.686 --> 00:01:24.187
For those of us
from this beautiful continent,

00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:27.194
to be African is to be inspired by culture

00:01:27.218 --> 00:01:29.797
and to be filled with undying
hope for the future.

00:01:30.647 --> 00:01:35.228
So in an attempt to shift
the misguided perceptions that many have

00:01:35.252 --> 00:01:36.927
about the place of my birth,

00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:39.847
I use design as a means to tell stories,

00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:41.409
stories about joy,

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:42.876
stories about triumph,

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.907
stories about perseverance
all throughout the African diaspora.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.882
I tell these stories

00:01:47.906 --> 00:01:51.255
as a concerted effort
to correct the historical record,

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:54.228
because, no matter
where any of us is from,

00:01:54.252 --> 00:01:56.878
each of us has been touched
by the complicated histories

00:01:56.902 --> 00:01:59.140
that brought our families
to a foreign land.

00:01:59.728 --> 00:02:02.612
These histories shape
the way we view the world,

00:02:02.636 --> 00:02:05.251
and they mold the biases
we carry around with us.

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:07.791
To combat these biases,

00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:10.538
my work draws aesthetics
from different parts of the globe

00:02:10.562 --> 00:02:12.563
and crafts a narrative
about the importance

00:02:12.587 --> 00:02:14.076
of fighting for inclusivity.

00:02:15.217 --> 00:02:18.075
By refashioning images
from classic European art

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.235
and marrying them with African aesthetics,

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:23.798
I am able to recast people of color
in roles of prominence,

00:02:23.822 --> 00:02:25.736
providing them with a degree of dignity

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.679
they didn't have in earlier times.

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:33.499
This approach subverts the historically
accepted narrative of African inferiority,

00:02:33.523 --> 00:02:36.032
and it serves as inspiration
for people of color

00:02:36.056 --> 00:02:39.477
who have grown wary of seeing
themselves depicted without sophistication

00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:40.651
and without grace.

00:02:42.072 --> 00:02:44.231
Each of these culture-bending tapestries

00:02:44.255 --> 00:02:46.240
becomes a tailored garment

00:02:46.264 --> 00:02:50.201
or a silk scarf, like the one I am
very coincidentally wearing right now.

00:02:50.225 --> 00:02:51.667
(Laughter)

00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:55.009
And even when surrounded
in a structure of European classicism,

00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:58.897
these narratives boldly extoll
the merits of African empowerment.

00:02:59.798 --> 00:03:04.624
In this way, the tools of the masters
become masterworks

00:03:04.648 --> 00:03:07.004
to celebrate those
who were once subservient.

00:03:09.014 --> 00:03:11.241
This metaphor extends
beyond the realm of art

00:03:11.265 --> 00:03:13.145
and out into the real world.

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.956
Whether worn by refugees
or world-changing entrepreneurs,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.647
when people are allowed
the freedom to present themselves

00:03:19.671 --> 00:03:22.488
in a manner that celebrates
their own unique identities,

00:03:22.512 --> 00:03:24.288
a magical thing happens.

00:03:24.312 --> 00:03:25.684
We stand taller.

00:03:25.708 --> 00:03:27.281
We're more proud and self-aware

00:03:27.305 --> 00:03:30.090
because we're presenting
our true, authentic selves.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.264
And those of us who are around them
in turn become more educated,

00:03:34.288 --> 00:03:37.747
more open and more tolerant
of their different points of view.

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:41.221
In this way, the clothes that we wear

00:03:41.245 --> 00:03:45.015
can be a great illustration
of diplomatic soft power.

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.852
The clothes that we wear
can serve as bridges

00:03:47.876 --> 00:03:50.437
between our seemingly disparate cultures.

00:03:50.461 --> 00:03:55.707
And so, yeah, ostensibly I stand
before you as a mere maker of clothing.

00:03:56.786 --> 00:03:59.215
But my work has always
been about more than fashion.

00:04:00.024 --> 00:04:02.787
It has become my purpose
to rewrite the cultural narratives

00:04:02.811 --> 00:04:06.803
so that people of color can be seen
in a new and nuanced light,

00:04:06.827 --> 00:04:08.042
and so that we,

00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:10.098
the proud children of sub-Saharan Africa,

00:04:10.122 --> 00:04:11.820
can traverse the globe

00:04:11.844 --> 00:04:13.724
while carrying ourselves with pride.

00:04:14.767 --> 00:04:17.158
It was indeed true
that the stories of history

00:04:17.182 --> 00:04:20.528
were told by its old victors,

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:22.345
but I am of a new generation.

00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:24.912
My work speaks for those

00:04:24.936 --> 00:04:28.449
who will no longer let their futures
be dictated by a troubled past.

00:04:28.473 --> 00:04:32.028
Today, we stand ready
to tell our own stories

00:04:32.052 --> 00:04:34.845
without compromise, without apologies.

00:04:35.402 --> 00:04:37.052
But the question still remains:

00:04:37.957 --> 00:04:40.886
are you prepared
for what you are about to hear?

00:04:42.981 --> 00:04:46.179
I hope you are, because
we are coming regardless.

00:04:46.622 --> 00:04:52.976
(Applause)
