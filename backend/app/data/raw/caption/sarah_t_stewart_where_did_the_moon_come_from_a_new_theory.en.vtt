00:00:13.161 --> 00:00:15.492
Nobody likes to make a mistake.

00:00:16.462 --> 00:00:18.309
And I made a whopping one.

00:00:19.534 --> 00:00:24.832
And figuring out what I did wrong
led to a discovery

00:00:24.856 --> 00:00:28.353
that completely changes the way
we think about the Earth and Moon.

00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:31.451
I'm a planetary scientist,

00:00:31.475 --> 00:00:35.205
and my favorite thing to do
is smash planets together.

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:36.240
(Laughter)

00:00:36.264 --> 00:00:42.083
In my lab, I can shoot at rocks
using cannons like this one.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.366
(Cannon shot)

00:00:44.762 --> 00:00:45.837
(Laughter)

00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:50.310
In my experiments, I can generate
the extreme conditions

00:00:50.334 --> 00:00:51.960
during planet formation.

00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:56.793
And with computer models,
I can collide whole planets together

00:00:56.817 --> 00:00:58.527
to make them grow,

00:00:58.551 --> 00:01:00.138
or I can destroy them.

00:01:00.162 --> 00:01:01.239
(Laughter)

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:06.778
I want to understand
how to make the Earth and the Moon

00:01:06.802 --> 00:01:10.042
and why the Earth is so different
from other planets.

00:01:11.414 --> 00:01:15.151
The leading idea for the origin
of the Earth and Moon

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:17.130
is called the "giant impact theory."

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:21.419
The theory states that a Mars-sized body
struck the young Earth,

00:01:21.443 --> 00:01:26.768
and the Moon formed from
the debris disk around the planet.

00:01:28.061 --> 00:01:31.272
The theory can explain
so many things about the Moon,

00:01:31.296 --> 00:01:33.317
but it has a huge flaw:

00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:38.582
it predicts that the Moon is mostly made
from the Mars-sized planet,

00:01:38.606 --> 00:01:41.950
that the Earth and the Moon
are made from different materials.

00:01:42.504 --> 00:01:44.165
But that's not what we see.

00:01:45.154 --> 00:01:48.871
The Earth and the Moon
are actually like identical twins.

00:01:49.704 --> 00:01:54.601
The genetic code of planets is written
in the isotopes of the elements.

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:57.494
The Earth and Moon
have identical isotopes.

00:01:57.518 --> 00:02:02.159
That means that the Earth and Moon
are made from the same materials.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.703
It's really strange that the Earth
and the Moon are twins.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.796
All of the planets are made
from different materials,

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.949
so they all have different isotopes,

00:02:11.973 --> 00:02:14.028
they all have their own genetic code.

00:02:14.695 --> 00:02:19.151
No other planetary bodies
have the same genetic relationship.

00:02:19.824 --> 00:02:22.271
Only the Earth and Moon are twins.

00:02:23.588 --> 00:02:26.163
When I started working
on the origin of the Moon,

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:30.264
there were scientists that wanted to
reject the whole idea of the giant impact.

00:02:30.288 --> 00:02:34.469
They didn't see any way for this theory
to explain the special relationship

00:02:34.493 --> 00:02:36.229
between the Earth and the Moon.

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:39.283
We were all trying to think of new ideas.

00:02:40.084 --> 00:02:43.064
The problem was,
there weren't any better ideas.

00:02:43.768 --> 00:02:47.302
All of the other ideas
had even bigger flaws.

00:02:48.437 --> 00:02:52.059
So we were trying to rescue
the giant impact theory.

00:02:53.376 --> 00:02:58.257
A young scientist in my group suggested
that we try changing the spin

00:02:58.281 --> 00:02:59.646
of the giant impact.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.064
Maybe making the Earth spin faster
could mix more material

00:03:04.088 --> 00:03:05.927
and explain the Moon.

00:03:06.623 --> 00:03:09.306
The Mars-sized impactor had been chosen

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.073
because it could make the Moon

00:03:11.097 --> 00:03:14.038
and make the length of Earth's day.

00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:17.429
People really liked
that part of the model.

00:03:18.481 --> 00:03:21.898
But what if something else determined
the length of Earth's day?

00:03:22.484 --> 00:03:27.206
Then there would be many more possible
giant impacts that could make the Moon.

00:03:28.444 --> 00:03:31.109
I was curious about what could happen,

00:03:31.133 --> 00:03:35.520
so I tried simulating
faster-spinning giant impacts,

00:03:35.544 --> 00:03:38.028
and I found that it is possible

00:03:38.052 --> 00:03:41.930
to make a disk out of the same
mixture of materials as the planet.

00:03:42.871 --> 00:03:44.881
We were pretty excited.

00:03:44.905 --> 00:03:47.577
Maybe this was the way
to explain the Moon.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.254
The problem is, we also found
that that's just not very likely.

00:03:54.278 --> 00:03:57.358
Most of the time, the disk
is different from the planet,

00:03:57.382 --> 00:04:00.219
and it looked like
making our Moon this way

00:04:00.243 --> 00:04:03.400
would be an astronomical coincidence,

00:04:04.243 --> 00:04:07.227
and it was just hard
for everyone to accept the idea

00:04:07.251 --> 00:04:11.062
that the Moon's special connection
to Earth was an accident.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.970
The giant impact theory
was still in trouble,

00:04:16.911 --> 00:04:20.050
and we were still trying to figure out
how to make the Moon.

00:04:21.932 --> 00:04:25.896
Then came the day
when I realized my mistake.

00:04:27.471 --> 00:04:32.410
My student and I were looking at the data
from these fast-spinning giant impacts.

00:04:32.434 --> 00:04:35.116
On that day, we weren't actually
thinking about the Moon,

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.795
we were looking at the planet.

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:39.358
The planet gets super-hot
and partially vaporized

00:04:39.382 --> 00:04:41.548
from the energy of the impact.

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.477
But the data didn't look like a planet.

00:04:45.501 --> 00:04:46.924
It looked really strange.

00:04:47.388 --> 00:04:49.785
The planet was weirdly
connected to the disk.

00:04:51.433 --> 00:04:54.220
I got that super-excited feeling

00:04:54.244 --> 00:04:57.945
when something really wrong
might be something really interesting.

00:05:00.011 --> 00:05:01.339
In all of my calculations,

00:05:01.363 --> 00:05:04.623
I had assumed there was a planet
with a separate disk around it.

00:05:04.647 --> 00:05:07.072
Calculating what was in the disk
as how we tested

00:05:07.096 --> 00:05:09.497
whether an impact could make the Moon.

00:05:10.828 --> 00:05:13.006
But it didn't look that simple anymore.

00:05:15.756 --> 00:05:18.839
We were making the mistake

00:05:18.863 --> 00:05:23.144
of thinking that a planet was always
going to look like a planet.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:31.109
On that day, I knew that a giant impact
was making something completely new.

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:34.959
I've had eureka moments.

00:05:35.655 --> 00:05:37.274
This was not one of them.

00:05:37.298 --> 00:05:38.465
(Laughter)

00:05:38.489 --> 00:05:41.402
I really didn't know what was going on.

00:05:42.062 --> 00:05:44.214
I had this strange, new object
in front of me

00:05:44.238 --> 00:05:47.019
and the challenge
to try and figure it out.

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:51.387
What do you do when faced
with the unknown?

00:05:52.054 --> 00:05:53.735
How do you even start?

00:05:55.058 --> 00:05:56.827
We questioned everything:

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.595
What is a planet?

00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:00.923
When is a planet no longer
a planet anymore?

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.191
We played with new ideas.

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:07.153
We had to get rid
of our old way of thinking,

00:06:07.177 --> 00:06:10.802
and by playing, I could
throw away all of the data,

00:06:10.826 --> 00:06:12.739
all of the rules of the real world,

00:06:12.763 --> 00:06:15.048
and free my mind to explore.

00:06:16.711 --> 00:06:18.637
And by making a mental space

00:06:19.501 --> 00:06:22.077
where I could try out outrageous ideas

00:06:23.233 --> 00:06:26.667
and then bring them back
into the real world to test them,

00:06:27.331 --> 00:06:28.685
I could learn.

00:06:31.423 --> 00:06:34.399
And by playing, we learned so much.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.338
I combined my lab experiments
with computer models

00:06:38.362 --> 00:06:40.944
and discovered that
after most giant impacts,

00:06:40.968 --> 00:06:43.130
the Earth is so hot, there's no surface.

00:06:43.154 --> 00:06:46.744
There's just a deep layer of gas
that gets denser and denser with depth.

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:49.292
The Earth would have been like Jupiter.

00:06:49.316 --> 00:06:50.832
There's nothing to stand on.

00:06:52.373 --> 00:06:55.245
And that was just part of the problem.

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:57.643
I wanted to understand the whole problem.

00:06:58.242 --> 00:07:02.153
I couldn't let go of the challenge
to figure out what was really going on

00:07:02.177 --> 00:07:03.646
in giant impacts.

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:06.310
It took almost two years

00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:08.981
of throwing away old ideas

00:07:09.733 --> 00:07:11.275
and building new ones

00:07:11.941 --> 00:07:13.825
that we understood the data

00:07:14.637 --> 00:07:16.446
and knew what it meant for the Moon.

00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:22.174
I discovered a new type
of astronomical object.

00:07:23.168 --> 00:07:24.587
It's not a planet.

00:07:25.087 --> 00:07:26.582
It's made from planets.

00:07:27.733 --> 00:07:30.251
A planet is a body whose self-gravity

00:07:30.275 --> 00:07:32.845
is strong enough to give it
its rounded shape.

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:34.663
It spins around all together.

00:07:35.415 --> 00:07:38.134
Make it hotter and spin it faster,

00:07:38.158 --> 00:07:41.971
the equator gets bigger and bigger
until it reaches a tipping point.

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.271
Push past the tipping point,

00:07:44.295 --> 00:07:48.392
and the material at the equator
spreads into a disk.

00:07:48.953 --> 00:07:51.722
It's now broken all the rules
of being a planet.

00:07:52.215 --> 00:07:54.610
It can't spin around together anymore,

00:07:54.634 --> 00:07:57.295
its shape keeps changing
as it gets bigger and bigger;

00:07:57.319 --> 00:07:59.286
the planet has become something new.

00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:03.681
We gave our discovery its name:

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:05.933
synestia.

00:08:06.402 --> 00:08:08.584
We named it after the goddess Hestia,

00:08:08.608 --> 00:08:10.914
the Greek goddess of the hearth and home,

00:08:10.938 --> 00:08:13.220
because we think the Earth became one.

00:08:13.244 --> 00:08:14.795
The prefix means "all together,"

00:08:14.819 --> 00:08:17.616
to emphasize the connection
between all of the material.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.842
A synestia is what a planet becomes

00:08:21.866 --> 00:08:26.316
when heat and spin push it over the limit
of a spheroidal shape.

00:08:27.691 --> 00:08:30.181
Would you like to see a synestia?

00:08:30.205 --> 00:08:32.244
(Cheers)

00:08:33.554 --> 00:08:37.486
In this visualization
of one of my simulations,

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.804
the young Earth is already spinning
quickly from a previous giant impact.

00:08:42.663 --> 00:08:45.899
Its shape is deformed, but our planet
would be recognizable

00:08:45.923 --> 00:08:47.829
by the water on its surface.

00:08:48.692 --> 00:08:52.549
The energy from the impact
vaporizes the surface,

00:08:52.573 --> 00:08:54.095
the water, the atmosphere,

00:08:54.119 --> 00:08:58.042
and mixes all of the gases together
in just a few hours.

00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:03.033
We discovered that many
giant impacts make synestias,

00:09:03.566 --> 00:09:06.543
but these burning, bright objects
don't live very long.

00:09:06.567 --> 00:09:10.103
They cool down, shrink
and turn back into planets.

00:09:11.266 --> 00:09:13.689
While rocky planets
like Earth were growing,

00:09:13.713 --> 00:09:17.239
they probably turned into synestias
one or more times.

00:09:19.338 --> 00:09:25.078
A synestia gives us a new way to solve
the problem of the origin of the Moon.

00:09:26.821 --> 00:09:33.736
We propose that the Moon formed
inside a huge, vaporous synestia.

00:09:34.285 --> 00:09:37.355
The Moon grew from magma rain

00:09:37.379 --> 00:09:39.794
that condensed out of the rock vapor.

00:09:41.198 --> 00:09:43.487
The Moon's special connection to Earth

00:09:43.511 --> 00:09:46.277
is because the Moon formed
inside the Earth

00:09:46.301 --> 00:09:48.181
when Earth was a synestia.

00:09:49.457 --> 00:09:53.743
The Moon could have orbited
inside the synestia for years,

00:09:53.767 --> 00:09:55.384
hidden from view.

00:09:56.622 --> 00:10:01.530
The Moon is revealed by the synestia
cooling and shrinking

00:10:01.554 --> 00:10:03.449
inside of its orbit.

00:10:06.652 --> 00:10:09.245
The synestia turns into planet Earth

00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:12.683
only after cooling
for hundreds of years longer.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.794
In our new theory,

00:10:16.818 --> 00:10:19.628
the giant impact makes a synestia,

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:23.297
and the synestia divides
into two new bodies,

00:10:23.321 --> 00:10:28.055
creating our isotopically
identical Earth and Moon.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.137
Synestias have been created
throughout the universe.

00:10:34.574 --> 00:10:40.155
And we only just realized that
by finding them in our imagination:

00:10:40.179 --> 00:10:45.082
What else am I missing
in the world around me?

00:10:45.106 --> 00:10:48.878
What is hidden from my view
by my own assumptions?

00:10:51.371 --> 00:10:53.665
The next time you look at the Moon,

00:10:53.689 --> 00:10:55.348
remember:

00:10:55.372 --> 00:10:57.204
the things you think you know

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.779
may be the opportunity to discover
something truly amazing.

00:11:05.167 --> 00:11:09.547
(Applause)
