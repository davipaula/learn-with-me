00:00:14.904 --> 00:00:18.170
The universe contains about 100 billion galaxies.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.136
Each of those galaxies contains about 100 billion stars.

00:00:22.136 --> 00:00:24.753
Many of those stars have planets orbiting them.

00:00:24.753 --> 00:00:27.503
So how do we look for life in all that immensity?

00:00:27.503 --> 00:00:31.603
It's like searching for a needle in trillions of haystacks.

00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:35.837
We might want to focus our search on planets that we know can support life as we know it --

00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:38.770
what we call habitable worlds.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.671
What do such planets look like?

00:00:40.671 --> 00:00:43.138
To answer that question, we don't look out there.

00:00:43.138 --> 00:00:45.621
Instead, we look at ourselves. At Earth.

00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:50.322
Because this is the one planet in the universe that we know for certain is habitable.

00:00:50.322 --> 00:00:53.870
When we look at Earth from space, we see a blue, watery world.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.754
It's no coincidence that three quarters of the surface is covered by oceans.

00:00:57.754 --> 00:01:00.688
Because of its unique chemical and physical properties,

00:01:00.688 --> 00:01:04.353
water is absolutely essential for all life as we know it.

00:01:04.353 --> 00:01:09.354
And so we get especially excited about other worlds on which water is abundant.

00:01:09.354 --> 00:01:11.720
Fortunately, water is very common in the universe.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.354
But life needs water in the form of liquid, not ice, and not vapor,

00:01:15.354 --> 00:01:17.288
and that's a little bit less common.

00:01:17.288 --> 00:01:21.654
For a planet to have liquid water at its surface, three things are important.

00:01:21.654 --> 00:01:24.686
First, the planet needs to be large enough that the force of gravity

00:01:24.686 --> 00:01:27.970
keeps the water molecules from flying off into space.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.803
For example, Mars is smaller than Earth, and so has less gravity,

00:01:31.803 --> 00:01:34.670
and that's one important reason that Mars has a very thin atmosphere,

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.639
and no oceans at its surface.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:41.221
Second, the planet needs to have an atmosphere. Why?

00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:43.837
Because without an atmosphere, the planet is in a vacuum,

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:46.606
and liquid water isn't stable in a vacuum.

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:50.787
For example, our moon has no atmosphere, and so if you spill some water on the moon,

00:01:50.787 --> 00:01:54.787
it will either boil away as vapor, or freeze solid to make ice.

00:01:54.787 --> 00:01:59.571
Without the pressure of an atmosphere, liquid water can't survive.

00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:02.787
Third, the planet needs to be at the right distance from its star.

00:02:02.787 --> 00:02:06.771
Too close, and the surface temperature will exceed the boiling point of water,

00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:09.203
and oceans will turn to vapor.

00:02:09.203 --> 00:02:12.989
Too far, and the surface temperature will fall below the freezing point of water,

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.903
causing the oceans to turn to ice.

00:02:15.903 --> 00:02:21.720
Fire or ice. For life as we know it, neither will suffice.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.287
You can imagine that the perfect zone where water stays liquid looks kind of like a belt around a star.

00:02:27.287 --> 00:02:30.388
We call that belt the habitable zone.

00:02:30.388 --> 00:02:36.087
So when we search for habitable worlds, we definitely want to look for planets in the habitable zones around their stars.

00:02:36.087 --> 00:02:40.603
Those regions are the best bets to find planets like Earth.

00:02:40.603 --> 00:02:44.937
But while habitable zones are a pretty good place to begin the search for planets with life,

00:02:44.937 --> 00:02:47.388
there are a couple of complications.

00:02:47.388 --> 00:02:51.421
First, a planet isn't necessarily habitable just because it's in the habitable zone.

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.988
Consider the planet Venus in our solar system.

00:02:53.988 --> 00:02:57.538
If you were an alien astronomer, you'd think Venus is a pretty good bet for life.

00:02:57.538 --> 00:03:01.937
It's the right size, it has an atmosphere, and it's in the habitable zone of our sun.

00:03:01.937 --> 00:03:05.239
An alien astronomer might see it as Earth's twin.

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.337
But Venus is not habitable, at least not at its surface.

00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:11.254
Not by life as we know it. It's too hot.

00:03:11.254 --> 00:03:15.870
That's because Venus' atmosphere is full of carbon dioxide, an important greenhouse gas.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.138
In fact, its atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide,

00:03:19.138 --> 00:03:22.203
and is almost 100 times thicker than our own.

00:03:22.203 --> 00:03:25.503
As a result, the temperature on Venus is hot enough to melt lead,

00:03:25.503 --> 00:03:28.739
and the planet is dry as a bone.

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.920
So finding planets of the right size and distance from their stars is only a beginning.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.053
We also want to know about the makeup of their atmospheres.

00:03:36.053 --> 00:03:40.037
The second complication emerges when we look a little more deeply at planet Earth.

00:03:40.037 --> 00:03:45.171
In the last 30 years, we've discovered microbes living in all sorts of extreme environments.

00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:47.870
We find them in fissures of rock miles beneath our feet,

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.021
in boiling waters of the ocean floor,

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.454
in acidic waters of thermal springs,

00:03:52.454 --> 00:03:55.637
and in cloud droplets miles above our heads.

00:03:55.637 --> 00:03:58.671
These so-called extremophiles aren't rare.

00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:03.071
Some scientists estimate that the mass of microbes living deep underground

00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:06.489
equals the mass of all the life at Earth's surface.

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.870
These subterranean microbes don't need oceans or sunshine.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.171
These discoveries suggest that Earth-like planets may be only the tip of the astrobiological iceberg.

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:18.988
It's possible that life might persist in aquifers beneath the surface of Mars.

00:04:18.988 --> 00:04:21.471
Microbes may thrive on Jupiter's moon Europa,

00:04:21.471 --> 00:04:25.253
where liquid water ocean probably lies beneath the icy crust.

00:04:25.253 --> 00:04:31.220
Another ocean beneath the surface of Saturn's moon Enceladus is the source of geysers erupting into space.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.304
Could these geysers be raining microbes?

00:04:33.304 --> 00:04:35.837
Could we fly through them to find out?

00:04:35.837 --> 00:04:39.405
And what about life as we don't know it, using a liquid other than water?

00:04:39.405 --> 00:04:43.804
Maybe we are the crazy creatures living in an unusual and extreme environment.

00:04:43.804 --> 00:04:46.371
Maybe the real habitable zone is so large

00:04:46.371 --> 00:04:49.888
that there are billions of needles in those trillions of haystacks.

00:04:49.888 --> 00:04:55.003
Maybe in the big scheme of things, Earth is only one of many different kinds of habitable worlds.

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:58.770
The only way to find out is to go out and explore.
