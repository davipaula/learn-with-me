00:00:06.792 --> 00:00:11.725
How is it that a breathalyzer can measure 
the alcohol content in someone’s blood,

00:00:11.725 --> 00:00:16.341
hours after they had their last drink, 
based on their breath alone?

00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:20.891
Exhaled breath contains trace amounts 
of hundreds, even thousands,

00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:23.351
of volatile organic compounds:

00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:27.835
small molecules lightweight enough 
to travel easily as gases.

00:00:27.835 --> 00:00:32.434
One of these is ethanol, 
which we consume in alcoholic drinks.

00:00:32.434 --> 00:00:36.409
It travels through the bloodstream 
to tiny air sacs in the lungs,

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:41.148
passing into exhaled air 
at a concentration 2,000 times lower,

00:00:41.148 --> 00:00:43.413
on average, than in the blood.

00:00:43.413 --> 00:00:45.815
When someone breathes 
into a breathalyzer,

00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:49.865
the ethanol in their breath 
passes into a reaction chamber.

00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:53.893
There, it’s converted to another molecule,
called acetic acid,

00:00:53.893 --> 00:00:58.907
in a special type of reactor that produces
an electric current during the reaction.

00:00:58.907 --> 00:01:02.025
The strength of the current 
indicates the amount of ethanol

00:01:02.025 --> 00:01:05.754
in the sample of air, 
and by extension in the blood.

00:01:05.754 --> 00:01:08.934
In addition to the volatile 
organic compounds like ethanol

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:11.040
we consume in food and drink,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.884
the biochemical processes of our cells 
produce many others.

00:01:14.884 --> 00:01:18.474
And when something disrupts 
those processes, like a disease,

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:21.764
the collection of volatile 
organic compounds in the breath

00:01:21.764 --> 00:01:23.624
may change, too.

00:01:23.624 --> 00:01:27.604
So could we detect disease 
by analyzing a person’s breath,

00:01:27.604 --> 00:01:30.401
without using more invasive 
diagnostic tools

00:01:30.401 --> 00:01:34.054
like biopsies, blood draws, and radiation?

00:01:34.054 --> 00:01:35.827
In theory, yes,

00:01:35.827 --> 00:01:40.717
but testing for disease is a lot more 
complicated than testing for alcohol.

00:01:40.717 --> 00:01:42.337
To identify diseases,

00:01:42.337 --> 00:01:46.803
researchers need to look at a set 
of tens of compounds in the breath.

00:01:46.803 --> 00:01:49.633
A given disease may cause 
some of these compounds

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:54.333
to increase or decrease in concentration, 
while others may not change—

00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:57.616
the profile is likely to be different 
for every disease,

00:01:57.616 --> 00:02:01.493
and could even vary for different stages 
of the same disease.

00:02:01.493 --> 00:02:05.283
For example, cancers are among 
the most researched candidates

00:02:05.283 --> 00:02:07.933
for diagnosis through breath analysis.

00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:10.933
One of the biochemical changes 
many tumors cause

00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:14.405
is a large increase 
in an energy-generating process

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:16.505
called glycolysis.

00:02:16.505 --> 00:02:18.415
Known as the Warburg Effect,

00:02:18.415 --> 00:02:24.169
this increase in glycolysis results 
in an increase of metabolites like lactate

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:28.339
which in turn can affect a whole cascade 
of metabolic processes

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:31.790
and ultimately result 
in altered breath composition,

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.325
possibly including an increased 
concentration of volatile compounds

00:02:36.325 --> 00:02:38.748
such as dimethyl sulfide.

00:02:38.748 --> 00:02:43.285
But the Warburg Effect is just one 
potential indicator of cancerous activity,

00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:47.303
and doesn’t reveal anything 
about the particular type of cancer.

00:02:47.303 --> 00:02:51.165
Many more indicators are needed 
to make a diagnosis.

00:02:51.165 --> 00:02:52.971
To find these subtle differences,

00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:55.841
researchers compare the breath 
of healthy people

00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:59.011
with the breath of people 
who suffer from a particular disease

00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:02.361
using profiles based on hundreds 
of breath samples.

00:03:02.361 --> 00:03:06.091
This complex analysis 
requires a fundamentally different,

00:03:06.091 --> 00:03:10.151
more versatile type of sensor 
from the alcohol breathalyzer.

00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:12.204
There are a few being developed.

00:03:12.204 --> 00:03:15.071
Some discriminate 
between individual compounds

00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:19.301
by observing how the compounds move 
through a set of electric fields.

00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:22.661
Others use an array of resistors 
made of different materials

00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:26.621
that each change their resistance 
when exposed to a certain mix

00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:29.161
of volatile organic compounds.

00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:30.937
There are other challenges too.

00:03:30.937 --> 00:03:34.867
These substances are present 
at incredibly low concentrations—

00:03:34.867 --> 00:03:37.207
typically just parts per billion,

00:03:37.207 --> 00:03:40.397
much lower than ethanol concentrations 
in the breath.

00:03:40.397 --> 00:03:44.287
Compounds’ levels may be affected 
by factors other than disease,

00:03:44.287 --> 00:03:48.737
including age, gender, nutrition, 
and lifestyle.

00:03:48.737 --> 00:03:50.056
Finally, there’s the issue

00:03:50.056 --> 00:03:52.667
of distinguishing which compounds 
in the sample

00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:54.657
were produced in the patient’s body

00:03:54.657 --> 00:03:57.047
and which were inhaled 
from the environment

00:03:57.047 --> 00:03:59.287
shortly before the test.

00:03:59.287 --> 00:04:03.657
Because of these challenges, 
breath analysis isn’t quite ready yet.

00:04:03.657 --> 00:04:06.758
But preliminary clinical trials 
on lung, colon,

00:04:06.758 --> 00:04:10.589
and other cancers 
have had encouraging results.

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:16.629
One day, catching cancer early 
might be as easy as breathing in and out.
