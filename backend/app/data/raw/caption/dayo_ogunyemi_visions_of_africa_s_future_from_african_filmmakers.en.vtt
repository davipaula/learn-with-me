00:00:12.982 --> 00:00:15.633
As a child growing up in Nigeria,

00:00:15.657 --> 00:00:17.836
books sparked my earliest imagination,

00:00:19.088 --> 00:00:22.389
but films, films transported me

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:25.881
to magical places with flying cars,

00:00:27.162 --> 00:00:30.437
to infinite space with whole universes
of worlds to discover.

00:00:31.413 --> 00:00:34.872
And my journey of discovery
has led to many places and possibilities,

00:00:34.896 --> 00:00:38.133
all linked with ideas and imagination.

00:00:39.213 --> 00:00:41.229
A decade and a half ago,

00:00:41.253 --> 00:00:44.328
I moved from working in law
and technology in New York

00:00:44.352 --> 00:00:48.448
to financing, producing
and distributing films

00:00:48.472 --> 00:00:51.179
in Nairobi, Lagos and Johannesburg.

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:56.236
I've been privileged
to see firsthand how in Africa,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.148
film powerfully explores
the marvelous and the mundane,

00:01:01.224 --> 00:01:05.256
how it conveys infinite possibilities
and fundamental truths.

00:01:06.552 --> 00:01:09.091
Afrofuturist films like "Pumzi,"

00:01:09.115 --> 00:01:13.032
Wanuri Kahiu's superb sci-fi flick,

00:01:13.056 --> 00:01:17.152
paint brilliant pictures
of Africa's future,

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:20.017
while Rungano Nyoni's "I Am Not A Witch"

00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:22.073
and Akin Omotoso's "Vaya"

00:01:22.097 --> 00:01:24.858
show us and catalogue our present.

00:01:25.358 --> 00:01:31.041
These filmmakers offer nuanced snapshots
of Africa's imagined and lived reality,

00:01:31.065 --> 00:01:35.469
in contrast to some of the images
of Africa that come from outside,

00:01:35.493 --> 00:01:38.764
and the perspectives
that accompany all of these images,

00:01:38.788 --> 00:01:42.192
whether sympathetic or dismissive,
shape or distort

00:01:43.383 --> 00:01:45.001
how people see Africa.

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:49.328
And the truth is,

00:01:49.352 --> 00:01:51.407
many people think Africa is screwed up.

00:01:53.134 --> 00:01:55.554
Images play a big part of the reason why.

00:01:59.015 --> 00:02:03.014
Many tropes about Africa
persist from pictures,

00:02:03.038 --> 00:02:06.737
pictures of famine
in Ethiopia 30 years ago,

00:02:06.761 --> 00:02:09.895
pictures of the Biafran war
half a century ago.

00:02:11.132 --> 00:02:16.410
But on a continent
where the average age is 17,

00:02:16.434 --> 00:02:19.067
these tragic events
seem almost prehistoric.

00:02:20.168 --> 00:02:22.794
Their images are far removed

00:02:22.818 --> 00:02:27.037
from how people in Africa's many countries
see themselves and their neighbors.

00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:32.089
For them, these images
do not represent their reality.

00:02:32.113 --> 00:02:34.204
So what is Africa's reality,

00:02:34.228 --> 00:02:38.725
or rather, which of Africa's
many realities do we choose to focus on?

00:02:39.053 --> 00:02:45.125
Do we accept Emmanuel Macron's
imagination of Africa in 2017

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:48.664
as a place in which all women
have seven or eight children?

00:02:50.807 --> 00:02:54.038
Or do we instead rely on the UN's account

00:02:54.062 --> 00:02:59.125
that only one of Africa's 54 countries
has a fertility rate as high as seven?

00:02:59.843 --> 00:03:01.586
Do we focus on the fact

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.399
that infant mortality
and life expectancy in Africa today

00:03:05.423 --> 00:03:08.408
is roughly comparable
to the US a hundred years ago,

00:03:08.432 --> 00:03:10.987
or do we focus on progress,

00:03:11.011 --> 00:03:14.242
the fact that Africa has cut
infant mortality in half

00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:15.535
in the last four decades

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:19.686
and has raised life expectancy by 10 years
since the year 2000?

00:03:21.556 --> 00:03:23.365
These dueling perspectives

00:03:25.327 --> 00:03:26.493
are all accurate.

00:03:26.517 --> 00:03:28.803
Well, aside from Macron's.
He's just wrong.

00:03:28.827 --> 00:03:30.692
(Laughter)

00:03:30.716 --> 00:03:36.256
But one version makes it easy
to dismiss Africa as hopeless,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.534
while the other fuels hope
that a billion people

00:03:38.558 --> 00:03:41.121
can continue to make progress
towards prosperity.

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.213
The fact that Africans

00:03:45.237 --> 00:03:48.649
do not have the luxury
of turning their gaze elsewhere,

00:03:48.673 --> 00:03:51.164
the fact that we must make progress

00:03:51.188 --> 00:03:53.657
or live with the consequence of failure,

00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:56.713
are the reason we must continue
to tell our own stories

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:58.547
and show our own images,

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:02.628
with honesty and primarily
to an African audience,

00:04:02.652 --> 00:04:05.159
because the image that matters most

00:04:05.183 --> 00:04:09.103
is the image of Africa
in African imaginations.

00:04:11.931 --> 00:04:14.630
Now, honesty requires that we acknowledge

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:16.670
that Africa is behind
the rest of the world

00:04:16.694 --> 00:04:19.224
and needs to move swiftly to catch up.

00:04:20.044 --> 00:04:21.966
But thinking of a way forward,

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.124
I'd like us to engage
in a thought exercise.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.339
What if we could go back a hundred years,

00:04:27.363 --> 00:04:29.925
say to the US in 1917,

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.525
but we could take with us
all the modern ideas,

00:04:33.549 --> 00:04:35.869
innovations, inventions
that we have today?

00:04:37.557 --> 00:04:40.137
What could we achieve with this knowledge?

00:04:40.161 --> 00:04:44.707
How richly could we improve quality
of life and living conditions for people?

00:04:46.355 --> 00:04:48.752
How widely could we spread prosperity?

00:04:50.594 --> 00:04:52.508
Imagine if a hundred years ago,

00:04:52.532 --> 00:04:55.745
the education system had
all the knowledge we have today,

00:04:55.769 --> 00:04:57.451
including how best to teach.

00:04:58.778 --> 00:05:01.901
And doctors and scientists knew all we do

00:05:01.925 --> 00:05:05.917
about public health measures,
surgery techniques,

00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:08.986
DNA sequencing,
cancer research and treatment?

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.804
If we had access then
to modern semiconductors,

00:05:12.828 --> 00:05:15.327
computers, mobile devices, the internet?

00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:17.778
Just imagine.

00:05:17.802 --> 00:05:22.508
If we did, we could take
a quantum leap forward, couldn't we.

00:05:22.532 --> 00:05:26.389
Well, Africa can take a leap
of that magnitude today.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.163
There's enough untapped innovation

00:05:30.187 --> 00:05:34.315
to move Africa a century forward
in living conditions

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:36.805
if the will and commitment is there.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.394
This is not just a possibility;
it's an imperative for Africa's future,

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:45.979
a future that will see
Africa's population double

00:05:46.003 --> 00:05:49.657
to two and a half billion people
in just three decades,

00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:53.919
a future that will see Africa
have the world's largest workforce,

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:59.130
just as the idea of work itself
is being radically reconsidered.

00:06:00.467 --> 00:06:03.107
Now taking the leap forward
isn't that far-fetched.

00:06:03.131 --> 00:06:06.094
There are tons of examples
that demonstrate the potential

00:06:06.118 --> 00:06:07.474
for change in Africa.

00:06:09.044 --> 00:06:10.448
Just 20 years ago,

00:06:11.782 --> 00:06:14.925
Nigeria had fewer than half a million
working phone lines.

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:18.021
Today it has a hundred million
mobile phone subscriptions,

00:06:18.045 --> 00:06:21.975
and this mobile miracle
is mirrored in every African country.

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:26.693
There are over three quarters of a billion
mobile phones in use in Africa today,

00:06:26.717 --> 00:06:30.599
and this has spurred justified
excitement about leapfrogging,

00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:34.567
about bringing the sharing economy,
artificial intelligence,

00:06:34.591 --> 00:06:36.821
autonomous machines to Africa.

00:06:38.686 --> 00:06:40.631
And this is all promising,

00:06:40.655 --> 00:06:42.774
but we need to think about sequencing.

00:06:44.504 --> 00:06:47.193
Forget putting the cart before the horse.

00:06:47.217 --> 00:06:49.883
You can't put the self-driving car
before the roads.

00:06:51.502 --> 00:06:56.653
(Applause)

00:06:56.677 --> 00:07:00.106
There's a whole infrastructural
and logical layer to innovation

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.424
that we take for granted,

00:07:02.448 --> 00:07:05.022
but we have to triage for Africa,

00:07:05.046 --> 00:07:08.276
because some of the biggest
infrastructure gaps

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.888
are for things that are so basic

00:07:09.912 --> 00:07:12.244
that Westerners rarely
have to think about them.

00:07:13.772 --> 00:07:15.292
So let's explore this.

00:07:18.008 --> 00:07:21.508
Imagine your internet access
went off for a day,

00:07:23.158 --> 00:07:25.159
and when it came back,

00:07:25.183 --> 00:07:27.469
it only stayed on
for three hours at a time,

00:07:27.493 --> 00:07:29.754
with random 15-hour outages?

00:07:31.027 --> 00:07:32.439
How would your life change?

00:07:33.773 --> 00:07:36.193
Now replace internet access
with electricity.

00:07:38.363 --> 00:07:40.911
Think of your fridges,
your TVs, your microwaves,

00:07:40.935 --> 00:07:42.537
just sitting idly for days.

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:47.197
Now extend this nightmare
to government offices,

00:07:47.221 --> 00:07:49.807
to businesses, to schools,

00:07:50.896 --> 00:07:52.086
to hospitals.

00:07:54.991 --> 00:07:57.531
This, or worse,

00:07:57.555 --> 00:08:00.758
is the type of access
that hundreds of millions of Africans

00:08:00.782 --> 00:08:01.999
have to electricity,

00:08:03.372 --> 00:08:04.522
and to water,

00:08:05.687 --> 00:08:06.837
and to healthcare,

00:08:07.769 --> 00:08:09.022
and to sanitation,

00:08:09.748 --> 00:08:10.975
and to education.

00:08:12.183 --> 00:08:13.389
We must fix this.

00:08:14.789 --> 00:08:18.780
We must fix this because ensuring
widespread and affordable access

00:08:18.804 --> 00:08:21.774
to decent infrastructure and services

00:08:21.798 --> 00:08:23.472
isn't just low-hanging fruit:

00:08:24.183 --> 00:08:26.813
it's fundamental to achieving
the hundred-year leap.

00:08:28.673 --> 00:08:30.539
And when we fix it,

00:08:30.563 --> 00:08:33.427
we might find some unexpected benefits.

00:08:35.093 --> 00:08:38.839
One unexpected benefit
of the mobile miracle

00:08:38.863 --> 00:08:43.006
was that it led to what is perhaps
the greatest cultural resurgence

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.498
that Africa has seen in a generation:

00:08:45.522 --> 00:08:47.814
the rebirth of African popular music.

00:08:49.162 --> 00:08:53.074
For musicians like P-Square,

00:08:53.098 --> 00:08:54.328
Bongo Maffin

00:08:55.764 --> 00:08:57.110
and Wizkid,

00:08:57.134 --> 00:09:00.849
mobile phones paved the path
to local dominance

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:02.047
and global stardom.

00:09:04.634 --> 00:09:08.104
And the impact
isn't limited just to music.

00:09:08.128 --> 00:09:09.539
It extends to film, too.

00:09:10.226 --> 00:09:12.814
Beautiful, engaging films

00:09:12.838 --> 00:09:15.235
like these stills of "Pumzi,"

00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:18.005
"Vaya," and "I Am Not A Witch" show.

00:09:19.515 --> 00:09:22.925
For while its external image
might be dated,

00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:26.301
Africa continues to evolve,
as does African film.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.618
Now, every now and again,
the rest of the world catches on,

00:09:30.642 --> 00:09:34.952
perhaps with Djo Munga's
hard-hitting "Viva Riva!"

00:09:34.976 --> 00:09:37.695
with Newton Aduaka's intense "Ezra,"

00:09:37.719 --> 00:09:40.465
or with Abderrahmane Sissako's
poetic "Timbuktu."

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.472
With mobile, Africans are discovering
more and more of these films,

00:09:45.496 --> 00:09:50.802
and what that means is that it really
matters less in Kinshasa or Cotonou

00:09:50.826 --> 00:09:53.494
what Cannes thinks of African film,

00:09:53.518 --> 00:09:57.167
or if those opinions are informed or fair.

00:09:58.113 --> 00:10:00.613
Who really cares what
the "New York Times" thinks?

00:10:01.565 --> 00:10:06.201
What matters is that Africans
are validating African art and ideas,

00:10:06.225 --> 00:10:08.567
both critically and commercially,

00:10:08.591 --> 00:10:10.599
that they are watching what they want,

00:10:10.623 --> 00:10:13.898
and that African filmmakers
are connecting with their core audiences.

00:10:15.881 --> 00:10:17.527
And this is important.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.798
It's important because film
can illuminate and inspire.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:25.806
Film can bring visions of the future
to us here in the present.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.617
Films can serve
as a conveyor belt for hope.

00:10:30.953 --> 00:10:34.109
And film can change perspectives
faster than we can build roads.

00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:38.141
In just over a decade,

00:10:38.165 --> 00:10:40.935
Nigeria's film industry, Africa's largest,

00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:45.873
has taken the country's
words and languages

00:10:45.897 --> 00:10:49.723
into the vocabulary
and imaginations of millions

00:10:49.747 --> 00:10:52.075
in many other African countries.

00:10:52.099 --> 00:10:54.084
It has torn down borders,

00:10:54.108 --> 00:10:56.986
perhaps in the most effective way
since the Berlin Conference

00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:00.129
sowed linguistic and geographic
division across Africa.

00:11:00.572 --> 00:11:03.096
Film does speak a universal language,

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.944
and boy, Nigerian film speaks it loudly.

00:11:06.845 --> 00:11:09.020
Making Africa's hundred-year leap

00:11:09.044 --> 00:11:12.845
will require that Africans summon
the creativity to generate ideas

00:11:13.916 --> 00:11:18.400
and find the openness to accept and adapt
ideas from anywhere else in the world

00:11:18.424 --> 00:11:20.817
to solve our pervasive problems.

00:11:21.121 --> 00:11:23.074
With focus on investment,

00:11:23.098 --> 00:11:26.455
films can help drive that change
in Africa's people,

00:11:26.479 --> 00:11:29.583
a change that is necessary
to make the hundred-year leap,

00:11:29.607 --> 00:11:33.241
a change that will help create
a prosperous Africa,

00:11:33.265 --> 00:11:35.931
an Africa that is dramatically
better than it is today.

00:11:37.609 --> 00:11:38.760
Thank you.
