00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.136
2014, July 5,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.360
the Ukrainian army entered
Sloviansk city in eastern Ukraine.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.816
They gathered all the locals
in Lenin Square.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.056
Then, they organized
the public crucifixion

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.256
of the son of a pro-Russia militant.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.760
He was only three years old.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.936
Refugee Galina Pyshnyak told this story
to Russia's First TV channel.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.016
In fact, this incident never happened.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.136
I visited Sloviansk.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.496
There is no Lenin Square.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.976
In reality, Galina's husband was an active
pro-Russia militant in Donbass.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.176
This is just one of many examples.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.096
Ukraine has been suffering
from Russian propaganda and fake news

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.536
for four years now,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.936
but Russia is not
the only player in this space.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.016
Fake news is happening
all around the world.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.896
We all know about fake news.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.056
We see it and read it all the time.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.616
But the thing about fake news

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.816
is that we don't always know
what is fake and what is real,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.776
but we base our decisions on facts
we get from the press and social media.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.856
When facts are false,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.440
decisions are wrong.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.056
A lot of people
stop believing anyone at all

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.816
and this is even more dangerous.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.776
They easily become prey
to populists in elections,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.680
or even take up arms.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.296
Fake news is not only bad for journalism.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.080
It's a threat for democracy and society.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.416
Four years ago, unmarked soldiers

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.216
entered the Crimean Peninsula,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.856
and at the same time,

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.040
Russian media was going crazy
with fake news about Ukraine.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.696
So a group of journalists, including me,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.656
started a website
to investigate this fake news.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.960
We called it StopFake.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.216
The idea was simple:

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.576
take a piece of news,
check it with verifiable proof

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.096
like photos, videos
and other strong evidence.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.640
If it turns out to be fake,
we put it on our website.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.216
Now, StopFake is an informational hub

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.680
which analyzes propaganda
in all its phases.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.416
We have 11 language versions,
we have millions of views,

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.576
We have taught more than 10,000 people

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.616
how to distinguish true from false.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.600
And we teach fact checkers
all around the world.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.880
StopFake has uncovered
more than 1,000 fakes about Ukraine.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.816
We've identified 18 narratives

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.376
created using this fake news,

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.016
such as Ukraine is a fascist state,

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.536
a failed state,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.416
a state run by a junta who came to power
as a result of a coup d'Ã©tat.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.216
We proved that it's not bad journalism;

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.200
it's a deliberate act of misinformation.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.256
Fake news is a powerful weapon
in information warfare,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.080
but there is something we can do about it.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.016
We all have smartphones.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.496
When we see something interesting,
it's often automatic.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.440
We just click and pass it along.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.240
But how can you
not be a part of fake news?

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.160
First, if it's too dramatic,
too emotional, too clickbait,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.160
then it's very likely that it isn't true.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.656
The truth is boring sometimes.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.056
(Laughter)

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.400
Manipulations are always sexy.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.120
They are designed to captivate you.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.776
Do your research.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.616
This is the second point, very simple.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.456
Look at other sites.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.096
Check out alternative news sources.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.536
Google names, addresses,
license plates, experts and authors.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.160
Don't just believe, check.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.800
It's the only way
to stop this culture of fake news.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.136
This information warfare
is not only about fake news.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.760
Our society depends on trust:

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.696
trust in our institutions,

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.096
in science,

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.176
trust in our leaders,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.680
trust in our news outlets.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.376
And it's on us to find a way
to rebuild trust,

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.520
because fake news destroys it.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.416
So ask yourself,

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.080
what have you lost your faith in?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.720
Where has trust been ruined for you?

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.400
And what are you going to do about it?

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.376
Thank you.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.920
(Applause)
