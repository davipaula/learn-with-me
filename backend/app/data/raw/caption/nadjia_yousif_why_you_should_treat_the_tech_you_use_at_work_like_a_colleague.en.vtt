00:00:12.727 --> 00:00:17.012
So, imagine a company hires
a new employee,

00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:18.296
best in the business,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.283
who's on a multimillion-dollar contract.

00:00:21.307 --> 00:00:25.923
Now imagine that whenever this employee
went to go meet with her team members,

00:00:25.947 --> 00:00:28.745
the appointments
were ignored or dismissed,

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.485
and in the meetings that did happen,

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.676
she was yelled at or kicked out
after a few minutes.

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:37.690
So after a while, she just
went quietly back to her desk,

00:00:37.714 --> 00:00:41.062
sat there with none of her skills
being put to use,

00:00:41.086 --> 00:00:43.258
of course, being ignored by most people,

00:00:43.282 --> 00:00:45.863
and of course, still getting paid
millions of dollars.

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:49.811
This hotshot employee
who can't seem to catch a break

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:52.399
is that company's technology.

00:00:53.308 --> 00:00:56.163
This scenario is not an exaggeration.

00:00:56.611 --> 00:00:58.785
In my job as a technology advisor,

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.242
I've seen so many companies
make the well-meaning decisions

00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:05.006
to put huge investments into technology,

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.694
only to have the benefits
fail to live up to the expectation.

00:01:08.718 --> 00:01:10.488
In fact, in one study I read,

00:01:10.512 --> 00:01:13.284
25 percent of technology projects

00:01:13.308 --> 00:01:17.590
are canceled or deliver things
that are never used.

00:01:17.614 --> 00:01:21.523
That's like billions of dollars
just being wasted each year.

00:01:22.138 --> 00:01:24.160
So why is this?

00:01:24.184 --> 00:01:25.578
Well, from what I've seen,

00:01:25.602 --> 00:01:29.621
the expectation from the top management
is high but not unreasonable

00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:31.771
about the benefits from the technology.

00:01:31.795 --> 00:01:34.695
They expect people will use them,

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.181
it will create time savings,

00:01:36.205 --> 00:01:38.931
and people will become
genuinely better at their jobs.

00:01:39.568 --> 00:01:42.382
But the reality is that
the people on the front line,

00:01:42.406 --> 00:01:45.313
who are supposed to be using
these softwares and tools,

00:01:45.337 --> 00:01:48.320
they're skeptical or even afraid.

00:01:48.344 --> 00:01:50.595
We postpone the online trainings,

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.682
we don't bother to learn the shortcuts,

00:01:52.706 --> 00:01:55.053
and we get frustrated
at the number of tools

00:01:55.077 --> 00:01:57.462
we have to remember
how to log into and use.

00:01:57.486 --> 00:01:58.784
Right?

00:01:58.808 --> 00:02:01.971
And that frustration,
that guilt -- it's racking up,

00:02:01.995 --> 00:02:06.851
the more that technology is inserting
itself into our daily working lives,

00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:08.118
which is a lot.

00:02:08.715 --> 00:02:12.410
Brookings says that 70 percent
of jobs today in the US

00:02:12.434 --> 00:02:15.257
require at least mid-level digital skills.

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:18.345
So basically, to work these days,

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:21.562
you need to be able
to work with technology.

00:02:21.586 --> 00:02:23.033
But from what I've seen,

00:02:23.057 --> 00:02:26.659
we are not approaching this
with the right mindset.

00:02:27.157 --> 00:02:30.088
So here's the idea
that I've been toying with:

00:02:31.096 --> 00:02:34.758
What if we treated technology
like a team member?

00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:38.834
I've been writing my own
personal experiment about this.

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:41.452
I've spoken to people
from all different industries

00:02:41.476 --> 00:02:46.246
about how they can treat
their core technologies like colleagues.

00:02:46.816 --> 00:02:49.658
I've met with people
from the restaurant industry,

00:02:49.682 --> 00:02:52.802
medical professionals, teachers, bankers,

00:02:52.826 --> 00:02:54.611
people from many other sectors,

00:02:54.635 --> 00:02:57.476
and the first step with anybody
that I would meet with

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.647
was to draw out
the structure of their teams

00:02:59.671 --> 00:03:01.595
in an organization chart.

00:03:02.242 --> 00:03:05.971
Now, I'm a total geek
when it comes to organization charts.

00:03:06.658 --> 00:03:10.070
Org charts are really cool
because, if they are drawn well,

00:03:10.094 --> 00:03:13.080
you can quickly get a sense
of what individual roles are

00:03:13.104 --> 00:03:15.172
and also how a team works well together.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.319
But if you look at a typical org chart,

00:03:18.343 --> 00:03:21.791
it only includes the boxes and lines
that represent people.

00:03:22.286 --> 00:03:25.433
None of the technology
team members are there.

00:03:25.457 --> 00:03:27.113
They're all invisible.

00:03:27.137 --> 00:03:31.694
So for each of the organizations
that I met with for my experiment,

00:03:31.718 --> 00:03:34.388
I had to draw a new type of org chart,

00:03:34.412 --> 00:03:36.876
one that also included the technology.

00:03:37.434 --> 00:03:39.671
And when I did this, people I spoke to

00:03:39.695 --> 00:03:43.542
could actually visualize
their technologies as coworkers,

00:03:43.566 --> 00:03:45.461
and they could ask things like:

00:03:45.485 --> 00:03:48.074
"Is this software reporting
to the right person?"

00:03:48.098 --> 00:03:51.244
"Does this man and machine team
work well together?"

00:03:51.268 --> 00:03:53.992
"Is that technology
actually the team member

00:03:54.016 --> 00:03:56.176
that everybody's awkwardly avoiding?"

00:03:56.964 --> 00:04:00.899
So I will walk you through an example
of a small catering company

00:04:00.923 --> 00:04:02.726
to bring this experiment to life.

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:08.051
This is the top layer of people
who work at Bovingdons Catering Company.

00:04:08.075 --> 00:04:12.040
There's a sales director, who manages
all of the customer interactions,

00:04:12.064 --> 00:04:16.198
and there's an operations director,
who manages all the internal activities.

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:19.860
And here's the people who report
to the sales and operations directors.

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:22.234
And finally, here's the view

00:04:22.258 --> 00:04:24.897
where we've overlaid
the software and the hardware

00:04:24.921 --> 00:04:26.840
that's used by the Bovingdons staff.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.089
Using this amazing org chart,
we can now explore

00:04:31.113 --> 00:04:33.846
how the human team members
and the technology team members

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.063
are interacting.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.016
So the first thing
that I'm going to look for

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.008
is where there's a human
and machine relationship

00:04:41.032 --> 00:04:42.897
that's extra critical.

00:04:42.921 --> 00:04:45.315
Usually, it's somebody using a technology

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:47.551
on a day-to-day basis
to do his or her job.

00:04:48.564 --> 00:04:49.749
At Bovingdons,

00:04:49.773 --> 00:04:52.837
the finance director with
the accounting platform would be one.

00:04:53.387 --> 00:04:57.230
Next, I would check on the status
of their collaboration.

00:04:57.254 --> 00:04:58.739
Are they working well together?

00:04:58.763 --> 00:04:59.993
Getting along?

00:05:00.017 --> 00:05:03.341
In this case, it turned out to be
a tenuous relationship.

00:05:03.937 --> 00:05:05.672
So, what to do?

00:05:05.696 --> 00:05:10.372
Well, if the accounting platform
were actually a person,

00:05:10.396 --> 00:05:13.693
the finance director would feel
responsible for managing it

00:05:13.717 --> 00:05:15.044
and taking care of it.

00:05:15.068 --> 00:05:16.513
Well, in the same way,

00:05:16.537 --> 00:05:19.887
my first suggestion was to think
about a team-building activity,

00:05:19.911 --> 00:05:22.914
maybe getting together
on a specialist course.

00:05:23.565 --> 00:05:28.330
My second suggestion was to think about
scheduling regular performance reviews

00:05:28.354 --> 00:05:30.117
for the accounting platform,

00:05:30.141 --> 00:05:33.236
where the finance director
would literally give feedback

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.668
to the company who sold it.

00:05:35.642 --> 00:05:40.053
Now, there will be several of these
really important human and machine teams

00:05:40.077 --> 00:05:41.719
in every organization.

00:05:41.743 --> 00:05:43.979
So if you're in one,
it's worth taking the time

00:05:44.003 --> 00:05:47.822
to think about ways to make
those relationships truly collaborative.

00:05:48.927 --> 00:05:52.630
Next, I'll look on the chart
for any human role

00:05:52.654 --> 00:05:55.577
which might be overloaded by technology,

00:05:55.601 --> 00:05:59.618
let's say, interacting with four
or more types of applications.

00:06:00.487 --> 00:06:05.379
At Bovingdons, the operations director
was interacting with five technologies.

00:06:05.403 --> 00:06:08.847
Now, he told me that he'd always felt
overwhelmed by his job,

00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:11.156
but it wasn't until our conversation

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.266
that he thought it might be because
of the technologies he was overseeing.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.676
And we were talking that,

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.407
if the operations director had actually
had a lot of people reporting to him,

00:06:21.431 --> 00:06:23.640
he probably would have done
something about it,

00:06:23.664 --> 00:06:25.552
because it was stretching him too thin,

00:06:25.576 --> 00:06:28.046
like, move some of them
to report to somebody else.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:31.554
So in the same way, we talked about
moving some of the technologies

00:06:31.578 --> 00:06:32.972
to report to someone else,

00:06:32.996 --> 00:06:35.421
like the food inventory to go to the chef.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.712
The last thing that I'll look for
is any technology

00:06:40.736 --> 00:06:44.812
that seems to be on the org chart
without a real home.

00:06:44.836 --> 00:06:47.625
Sometimes they're floating around
without an owner.

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:50.711
Sometimes they're reporting
to so many different areas

00:06:50.735 --> 00:06:52.846
that you can't tell
who's actually using it.

00:06:53.648 --> 00:06:54.834
Now, at Bovingdons,

00:06:54.858 --> 00:06:58.089
nobody appeared to be looking after
the marketing software.

00:06:58.746 --> 00:07:02.268
It was like someone had hired it
and then didn't give it a desk

00:07:02.292 --> 00:07:03.978
or any instructions on what to do.

00:07:04.806 --> 00:07:07.171
So clearly, it needed a job description,

00:07:07.195 --> 00:07:08.870
maybe someone to manage it.

00:07:09.497 --> 00:07:10.693
But in other companies,

00:07:10.717 --> 00:07:15.093
you might find that a technology
has been sidelined for a reason,

00:07:15.117 --> 00:07:18.716
like it's time for it
to leave or be retired.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.303
Now, retiring applications
is something that all companies do.

00:07:23.327 --> 00:07:28.318
But maybe taking the mindset that those
applications are actually coworkers

00:07:28.342 --> 00:07:31.778
could help them to decide when and how
to retire those applications

00:07:31.802 --> 00:07:35.171
in the way that would be least destructive
to the rest of the team.

00:07:36.552 --> 00:07:40.058
I did this experiment
with 15 different professionals,

00:07:40.082 --> 00:07:42.400
and each time it sparked an idea.

00:07:42.932 --> 00:07:44.378
Sometimes, a bit more.

00:07:44.996 --> 00:07:47.859
You remember that hotshot employee
I was telling you about,

00:07:47.883 --> 00:07:49.704
that everybody was ignoring?

00:07:49.728 --> 00:07:52.972
That was a real story
told to me by Christopher,

00:07:52.996 --> 00:07:57.297
a very energetic human resources manager
at a big consumer goods company.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:01.443
Technology was a new HR platform,

00:08:01.467 --> 00:08:05.755
and it had been installed
for 14 months at great expense,

00:08:05.779 --> 00:08:07.757
but nobody was using it.

00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:11.022
So we were talking about how,

00:08:11.046 --> 00:08:16.240
if this had really been such a hotshot
employee with amazing credentials,

00:08:16.264 --> 00:08:18.513
you would go out of your way
to get to know it,

00:08:18.537 --> 00:08:20.647
maybe invite them for coffee,

00:08:20.671 --> 00:08:22.992
get to know their background.

00:08:23.016 --> 00:08:26.401
So in the spirit of experimentation,

00:08:26.425 --> 00:08:29.265
Christopher set up one-hour appointments,

00:08:29.289 --> 00:08:30.805
coffee optional,

00:08:30.829 --> 00:08:36.764
for his team members to have no agenda
but to get to know their HR system.

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:40.692
Some people, they clicked around
menu item by menu item.

00:08:40.716 --> 00:08:44.569
Other people, they searched online
for things that they weren't clear about.

00:08:44.593 --> 00:08:48.102
A couple of them got together,
gossiped about the new software in town.

00:08:48.896 --> 00:08:51.559
And a few weeks later,
Christopher called to tell me

00:08:51.583 --> 00:08:54.941
that people were using
the system in new ways,

00:08:54.965 --> 00:08:58.326
and he thought it was going to save them
weeks of effort in the future.

00:08:59.025 --> 00:09:03.540
And they also reported feeling
less intimidated by the software.

00:09:03.564 --> 00:09:05.208
I found that pretty amazing,

00:09:05.232 --> 00:09:08.308
that taking this mindset
helped Christopher's team

00:09:08.332 --> 00:09:10.707
and others that I spoke to
these past few months

00:09:10.731 --> 00:09:13.744
actually feel happier
about working with technology.

00:09:14.268 --> 00:09:16.967
And I later found out
this is backed up by research.

00:09:17.406 --> 00:09:20.887
Studies have shown that people
who work in organizations

00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:24.154
that encourage them to talk about
and learn about the technologies

00:09:24.178 --> 00:09:25.333
in the workplace

00:09:25.357 --> 00:09:27.549
have 20 percent lower stress levels

00:09:27.573 --> 00:09:29.703
than those in organizations that don't.

00:09:30.607 --> 00:09:34.728
I also found it really cool
that when I started to do this experiment,

00:09:34.752 --> 00:09:37.553
I started with what was happening
between a person

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:39.499
and an individual technology,

00:09:39.523 --> 00:09:43.085
but then it ultimately led to ideas
about how to manage tech

00:09:43.109 --> 00:09:45.132
across entire companies.

00:09:45.156 --> 00:09:48.538
Like, when I did this
for my own job and extended it,

00:09:48.562 --> 00:09:51.111
I thought about how
our data analysis tools

00:09:51.135 --> 00:09:54.500
should go on the equivalent
of a job rotation program,

00:09:54.524 --> 00:09:57.377
where different parts of the company
could get to know it.

00:09:57.401 --> 00:10:00.573
And I also thought about suggesting
to our recruiting team

00:10:00.597 --> 00:10:03.186
that some of the technologies
we work with every day

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.764
should come with us
on our big recruiting events.

00:10:05.788 --> 00:10:07.390
If you were a university student,

00:10:07.414 --> 00:10:10.029
how cool would it be to not
only get to know the people

00:10:10.053 --> 00:10:11.312
you might be working with,

00:10:11.336 --> 00:10:12.957
but also the technologies?

00:10:13.637 --> 00:10:15.917
Now, all of this begs the question:

00:10:15.941 --> 00:10:17.448
What have we been missing

00:10:17.472 --> 00:10:21.239
by keeping the technologies
that we work with day to day invisible,

00:10:21.263 --> 00:10:24.410
and what, beyond those
billions of dollars in value,

00:10:24.434 --> 00:10:26.134
might we be leaving on the table?

00:10:27.189 --> 00:10:28.513
The good news is,

00:10:28.537 --> 00:10:31.021
you don't need to be
an org chart geek like me

00:10:31.045 --> 00:10:32.710
to take this experiment forward.

00:10:33.267 --> 00:10:35.603
It will take a matter
of minutes for most people

00:10:35.627 --> 00:10:37.804
to draw out a structure
of who they work with,

00:10:37.828 --> 00:10:40.051
a little bit longer
to add in the technologies

00:10:40.075 --> 00:10:41.791
to get a view of the entire team,

00:10:41.815 --> 00:10:44.617
and then you can have fun
asking questions like,

00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:48.043
"Which are the technologies
that I'll be taking out for coffee?"

00:10:48.067 --> 00:10:51.295
Now, I didn't do this experiment for kicks

00:10:51.319 --> 00:10:52.873
or for the coffee.

00:10:52.897 --> 00:10:57.531
I did it because the critical skill
in the 21st-century workplace

00:10:57.555 --> 00:11:00.171
is going to be to collaborate
with the technologies

00:11:00.195 --> 00:11:04.113
that are becoming such a big and costly
part of our daily working lives.

00:11:04.137 --> 00:11:07.760
And from what I was seeing,
we are struggling to cope with that.

00:11:08.276 --> 00:11:10.998
So it might sound counterintuitive,

00:11:11.022 --> 00:11:16.134
but by embracing the idea that these
machines are actually valuable colleagues,

00:11:16.158 --> 00:11:18.110
we as people will perform better

00:11:18.134 --> 00:11:19.650
and be happier.

00:11:19.674 --> 00:11:22.691
So let's all share a bit of humanity

00:11:22.715 --> 00:11:26.243
towards the technologies
and the softwares and the algorithms

00:11:26.267 --> 00:11:28.246
and the robots who we work with,

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.792
because we will all be the better for it.

00:11:31.372 --> 00:11:33.053
Thank you.

00:11:33.077 --> 00:11:35.758
(Applause)
