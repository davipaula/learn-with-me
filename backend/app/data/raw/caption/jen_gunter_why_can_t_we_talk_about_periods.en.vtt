00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:16.292
When I was a teen, I had terrible periods.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.476
I had crippling cramps,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.309
I leaked blood onto my clothes
and onto my bed sheets,

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.333
and I had period diarrhea.

00:00:24.792 --> 00:00:27.768
And I had to miss school
one to two days a month,

00:00:27.792 --> 00:00:32.309
and I remember sitting on the couch
with my heating pads, thinking,

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.893
"What's up with this?"

00:00:34.917 --> 00:00:39.434
When I ate food, I didn't leak saliva
from my salivary glands.

00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:40.726
When I went for a walk,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.101
I didn't leak fluid from my knees, 
"joint fluid."

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:48.351
Why was menstruation so different?

00:00:48.375 --> 00:00:50.351
I wanted answers to these questions

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:52.143
but there was no one for me to ask.

00:00:52.167 --> 00:00:54.351
My mother knew nothing about menstruation

00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:58.059
except that it was dirty and shameful
and I shouldn't talk about it.

00:00:58.083 --> 00:00:59.934
I asked girlfriends

00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.643
and everybody spoke in euphemisms.

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:05.893
And finally, when I got the courage
to go to the doctor

00:01:05.917 --> 00:01:07.768
and talk about my heavy periods,

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:09.893
I was told to eat liver.

00:01:09.917 --> 00:01:12.226
(Laughter)

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.226
And when I went to the drug store
to buy my menstrual products,

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.684
my 48-pack of super maxi pads,

00:01:20.708 --> 00:01:24.059
back in the day when they were the size
of a tissue box, each pad --

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:25.101
(Laughter)

00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:26.726
You know what I'm talking about.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.434
You have no idea how far
absorbent technology has come.

00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:31.768
(Laughter)

00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:34.476
I used to have to buy
my menstrual products

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.893
in the feminine hygiene aisle.

00:01:37.917 --> 00:01:39.893
And I remember standing there, thinking,

00:01:39.917 --> 00:01:42.934
"Well, why don't I buy toilet paper
in the anal hygiene aisle?"

00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:43.976
(Laughter)

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.268
Like, what's up with that?

00:01:45.292 --> 00:01:48.393
Why can't we talk about periods?

00:01:48.417 --> 00:01:52.559
And it's not about the blood,
as Freud would have you say,

00:01:52.583 --> 00:01:53.851
because if it were,

00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:57.018
there would be an ear, nose
and throat surgeon up here right now,

00:01:57.042 --> 00:01:59.976
talking about the taboos
of nose bleeds, right?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.476
And it's not even about periods,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.601
because otherwise, when we got rid
of our toxic, shameful periods

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.059
when we became menopausal,

00:02:07.083 --> 00:02:09.768
we'd be elevated
to a higher social status.

00:02:09.792 --> 00:02:12.059
(Laughter)

00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:16.934
(Applause)

00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:20.518
It's just a patriarchal society is
invested in oppressing women,

00:02:20.542 --> 00:02:23.601
and at different points in our lives,
different things are used.

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:24.893
And menstruation is used

00:02:24.917 --> 00:02:27.934
during what we in medicine call
the reproductive years.

00:02:27.958 --> 00:02:30.976
It's been around since
pretty much the beginning of time,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.059
many cultures thought
that women could spoil crops

00:02:34.083 --> 00:02:36.768
or milk, or wilt flowers.

00:02:36.792 --> 00:02:38.518
And then when religion came along,

00:02:38.542 --> 00:02:41.143
purity myths only made that worse.

00:02:41.167 --> 00:02:43.476
And medicine wasn't any help.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.143
In the 1920s and '30s

00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:49.684
there was the idea that women elaborated
something called a menotoxin.

00:02:49.708 --> 00:02:52.268
We could wilt flowers just by walking by.

00:02:52.292 --> 00:02:53.393
(Laughter)

00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:56.143
And that's what happens
when there's no diversity, right.

00:02:56.167 --> 00:02:58.684
Because there was no woman
to put her hand up and go,

00:02:58.708 --> 00:03:01.167
"Well, actually, that doesn't happen."

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.976
And when you can't talk
about what's happening to your body,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.018
how do you break these myths?

00:03:07.042 --> 00:03:09.059
Because you don't even need to be a doctor

00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:10.976
to say that periods aren't toxic.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.708
If they were, why would an embryo
implant in a toxic swill?

00:03:16.708 --> 00:03:20.268
And if we all had this secret menotoxin,

00:03:20.292 --> 00:03:23.559
we could be laying waste
to crops and spoiling milk.

00:03:23.583 --> 00:03:24.601
(Laughter)

00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:28.601
Why would we have not used
our X-Women powers to get the vote sooner?

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.809
(Laughter)

00:03:30.833 --> 00:03:35.393
(Applause)

00:03:35.417 --> 00:03:36.684
Even now,

00:03:36.708 --> 00:03:38.934
when I tweet about period diarrhea,

00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.226
as one does,

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.184
(Laughter)

00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:45.976
I mention that it affects
28 percent of women.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.684
And every single time,
someone approaches me and says,

00:03:49.708 --> 00:03:52.851
"I thought I was the only one."

00:03:52.875 --> 00:03:55.518
That's how effective
that culture of shame is,

00:03:55.542 --> 00:03:59.309
that women can't even share
their experiences.

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:00.768
So I began to think,

00:04:00.792 --> 00:04:04.143
"Well, what if everybody knew
about periods like a gynecologist?

00:04:04.167 --> 00:04:05.851
Wouldn't that be great?"

00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:07.601
Then you would all know what I know,

00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:08.976
you'd know that menstruation

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.476
is a pretty unique
phenomenon among mammals.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.476
Most mammals have estrus.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.309
Humans, some primates,

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:17.601
some bats,

00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:20.851
the elephant shrew
and the spiny mouse menstruate.

00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:24.351
And with menstruation what happens is
the brain triggers the ovary

00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:26.476
to start producing an egg.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.768
Estrogen is released

00:04:27.792 --> 00:04:30.226
and it starts to build up
the lining of the uterus,

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.393
cell upon cell, like bricks.

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:35.601
And what happens if you build
a brick wall too high without mortar?

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:36.893
Well, it's unstable.

00:04:36.917 --> 00:04:38.518
So what happens when you ovulate?

00:04:38.542 --> 00:04:40.684
You release a hormone called progesterone,

00:04:40.708 --> 00:04:44.976
which is progestational,
it gets the uterus ready.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.226
It acts like a mortar
and it holds those bricks together.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.643
It also causes some changes

00:04:50.667 --> 00:04:54.351
to make the lining more hospitable
for implantation.

00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:55.763
If there's no pregnancy,

00:04:55.773 --> 00:04:56.602
(Whoosh)

00:04:56.602 --> 00:04:57.851
lining comes out,

00:04:57.875 --> 00:05:00.976
there's bleeding from the blood vessels
and that's the period.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.309
And I always find this point
really interesting.

00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:04.851
Because with estrus,

00:05:04.875 --> 00:05:08.059
the final signaling to get
the lining of the uterus ready

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:10.809
actually comes from the embryo.

00:05:10.833 --> 00:05:12.643
But with menstruation,

00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:15.268
that choice comes from the ovary.

00:05:15.292 --> 00:05:19.018
It's as if choice is coded in
to our reproductive tracts.

00:05:19.042 --> 00:05:25.917
(Cheering and applause)

00:05:27.625 --> 00:05:30.184
OK, so now we know why the blood is there.

00:05:30.208 --> 00:05:31.976
And it's a pretty significant amount.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.018
It's 30 to 90 milliliters of blood,

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:35.601
which is one to three ounces,

00:05:35.625 --> 00:05:36.893
and it can be more,

00:05:36.917 --> 00:05:40.018
and I know it seems like it's more
a lot of the times.

00:05:40.042 --> 00:05:41.309
I know.

00:05:41.333 --> 00:05:43.226
So why do we have so much blood?

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.434
And why doesn't it just stay there
till the next cycle, right?

00:05:46.458 --> 00:05:49.268
Like, you didn't get pregnant,
so why can't it hang around?

00:05:49.292 --> 00:05:52.934
Well imagine if each month it got thicker
and thicker and thicker, right,

00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.684
like, imagine what tsunami
period that would be.

00:05:55.708 --> 00:05:57.351
(Laughter)

00:05:57.375 --> 00:05:59.684
We can't reabsorb it,
because it's too much.

00:05:59.708 --> 00:06:02.809
And it's too much because we need
a thick uterine lining

00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:05.643
for a very specific reason.

00:06:05.667 --> 00:06:11.143
Pregnancy exerts a significant
biological toll on our bodies.

00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:12.809
There is maternal mortality,

00:06:12.833 --> 00:06:14.476
there is the toll of breastfeeding

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.559
and there is the toll of raising a child
until it is independent.

00:06:18.583 --> 00:06:19.851
And evolution --

00:06:19.875 --> 00:06:22.893
(Laughter)

00:06:22.917 --> 00:06:25.143
That goes on longer
for some of us than others.

00:06:25.167 --> 00:06:27.643
(Laughter)

00:06:27.667 --> 00:06:31.101
But evolution knows
about risk-benefit ratio.

00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:35.726
And so evolution wants to maximize
the chance of a beneficial outcome.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.559
And how do you maximize the chance
of a beneficial outcome?

00:06:38.583 --> 00:06:40.768
You try to get the highest
quality embryos.

00:06:40.792 --> 00:06:43.018
And how do you get
the highest quality embryos?

00:06:43.042 --> 00:06:44.893
You make them work for it.

00:06:44.917 --> 00:06:47.351
You give them an obstacle course.

00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:50.726
So over the millennia
that we have evolved,

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.393
it's been a little bit
like an arms race in the uterus,

00:06:53.417 --> 00:06:55.893
the lining getting thicker
and thicker and thicker,

00:06:55.917 --> 00:06:57.684
and the embryo getting more invasive

00:06:57.708 --> 00:06:59.185
until we reach this détente

00:06:59.209 --> 00:07:01.976
with the lining
of the uterus that we have.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.726
So we have this thick uterine lining

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.934
and now it's got to come out,

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.059
and how do you stop bleeding?

00:07:08.083 --> 00:07:10.476
Well, you stop a nose bleed
by pinching it,

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.809
if you cut your leg,
you put pressure on it.

00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:14.684
We stop bleeding with pressure.

00:07:14.708 --> 00:07:16.309
When we menstruate,

00:07:16.333 --> 00:07:18.434
the lining of the uterus
releases substances

00:07:18.458 --> 00:07:21.476
that are made into chemicals
called prostaglandins

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.726
and other inflammatory mediators.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.768
And they make the uterus cramp down,

00:07:25.792 --> 00:07:27.851
they make it squeeze
on those blood vessels

00:07:27.875 --> 00:07:29.559
to stop the bleeding.

00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:31.774
They might also change
blood flow to the uterus

00:07:31.798 --> 00:07:34.851
and also cause inflammation
and that makes pain worse.

00:07:34.875 --> 00:07:38.351
And so you say, "OK,
how much pressure is generated?"

00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:41.434
And from studies
where some incredible women

00:07:41.458 --> 00:07:43.476
have volunteered
to have pressure catheters

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.768
put in their uterus

00:07:44.792 --> 00:07:47.101
that they wear
their whole menstrual cycle --

00:07:47.125 --> 00:07:50.268
God bless them, because
we wouldn't have this knowledge without,

00:07:50.292 --> 00:07:52.226
and it's very important knowledge,

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.059
because the pressure
that's generated in the uterus

00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:56.351
during menstruation

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:58.476
is 120 millimeters of mercury.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.893
"Well what's that," you say.

00:07:59.917 --> 00:08:02.726
Well, it's the amount of pressure
that's generated

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.268
during the second stage of labor
when you're pushing.

00:08:05.292 --> 00:08:06.434
(Audience gasps)

00:08:06.458 --> 00:08:07.726
Right.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.893
Which, for those of you
who haven't had an unmedicated delivery,

00:08:10.917 --> 00:08:13.309
that's what it's like
when the blood pressure cuff

00:08:13.333 --> 00:08:15.619
is not quite as tight as it was
at the beginning,

00:08:15.643 --> 00:08:17.018
but it's still pretty tight,

00:08:17.042 --> 00:08:18.393
and you wish it would stop.

00:08:18.417 --> 00:08:20.559
So that kind of makes it different, right?

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:24.476
If you start thinking
about the pain of menstruation,

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.101
we wouldn't say
if someone needed to miss school

00:08:27.125 --> 00:08:29.934
because they were in the second stage
of labor and pushing,

00:08:29.958 --> 00:08:31.309
we wouldn't call them weak.

00:08:31.333 --> 00:08:34.101
We'd be like, "Oh my God,
you made it that far," right?

00:08:34.125 --> 00:08:35.143
(Laughter)

00:08:35.167 --> 00:08:37.601
And we wouldn't deny pain control

00:08:37.625 --> 00:08:41.101
to women who have
typical pain of labor, right?

00:08:41.125 --> 00:08:44.559
So it's important for us to call this pain
"typical" instead of "normal,"

00:08:44.583 --> 00:08:47.518
because when we say it's normal,
it's easier to dismiss.

00:08:47.542 --> 00:08:51.018
As opposed to saying it's typical,
and we should address it.

00:08:51.042 --> 00:08:55.518
And we do have some ways
to address menstrual pain.

00:08:55.542 --> 00:08:57.643
One way is with something
called a TENS unit,

00:08:57.667 --> 00:08:59.476
which you can wear under your clothes

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.601
and it sends an electrical impulse
to the nerves and muscles

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:04.434
and no one really knows how it works,

00:09:04.458 --> 00:09:06.976
but we think it might be
the gate theory of pain,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.559
which is counterirritation.

00:09:08.583 --> 00:09:12.351
It's the same reason why,
if you hurt yourself, you rub it.

00:09:12.375 --> 00:09:16.184
Vibration travels faster
to your brain than pain does.

00:09:16.208 --> 00:09:17.559
We also have medications

00:09:17.583 --> 00:09:20.351
called nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory medications.

00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:24.143
And what they do is they block
the release of prostaglandins.

00:09:24.167 --> 00:09:28.059
They can reduce menstrual pain
for 80 percent of women.

00:09:28.083 --> 00:09:31.851
They also reduce the volume of blood
by 30 to 40 percent

00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:34.268
and they can help with period diarrhea.

00:09:34.292 --> 00:09:36.851
And we also have hormonal contraception,

00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:39.143
which gives us a thinner
lining of the uterus,

00:09:39.167 --> 00:09:41.476
so there's less prostaglandins produced

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.851
and with less blood,
there's less need for cramping.

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:47.643
Now, if those treatments fail you --

00:09:47.667 --> 00:09:49.893
and it's important to use
that word choice,

00:09:49.917 --> 00:09:52.309
because we never fail the treatment,

00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:54.934
the treatment fails us.

00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:57.101
If that treatment fails you,

00:09:57.125 --> 00:09:58.602
you could be amongst the people

00:09:58.626 --> 00:10:02.684
who have a resistance
to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories.

00:10:02.708 --> 00:10:04.268
We don't quite understand,

00:10:04.292 --> 00:10:06.393
but there are some complex mechanisms

00:10:06.417 --> 00:10:09.976
why those medications
just don't work for some women.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.309
It's also possible that you could have

00:10:13.333 --> 00:10:15.726
another reason for painful periods.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.434
You could have a condition
called endometriosis,

00:10:18.458 --> 00:10:21.518
where the lining of the uterus
is growing in the pelvic cavity,

00:10:21.542 --> 00:10:25.101
causing inflammation
and scar tissue and adhesions.

00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:28.518
And there may be other mechanisms
we don't quite understand yet,

00:10:28.542 --> 00:10:31.726
because it's a possibility
that pain thresholds could be different

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.434
due to very complex biological mechanisms.

00:10:34.458 --> 00:10:37.643
But we're only going to find that out
by talking about it.

00:10:37.667 --> 00:10:40.768
It shouldn't be an act of feminism

00:10:40.792 --> 00:10:42.934
to know how your body works.

00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.226
It shouldn't --

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:49.768
(Applause)

00:10:49.792 --> 00:10:53.268
It shouldn't be an act of feminism

00:10:53.292 --> 00:10:55.875
to ask for help when you're suffering.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:11:01.833
The era of menstrual taboos is over.

00:11:02.583 --> 00:11:07.309
(Cheers and applause)

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.476
The only curse here

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.101
is the ability to convince
half the population

00:11:13.125 --> 00:11:17.518
that the very biological machinery
that perpetuates the species,

00:11:17.542 --> 00:11:20.018
that gives everything that we have,

00:11:20.042 --> 00:11:22.601
is somehow dirty or toxic.

00:11:22.625 --> 00:11:25.184
And I'm not going to stand for it.

00:11:25.208 --> 00:11:30.893
(Applause)

00:11:30.917 --> 00:11:33.351
And the way we break that curse?

00:11:33.375 --> 00:11:34.934
It's knowledge.

00:11:34.958 --> 00:11:36.226
Thank you.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:41.458
(Cheers and applause)
