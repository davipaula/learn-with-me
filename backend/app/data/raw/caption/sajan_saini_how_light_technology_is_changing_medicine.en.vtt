00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.820
It’s an increasingly common sight 
in hospitals around the world:

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.790
a nurse measures our height, 
weight, blood pressure,

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.560
and attaches a glowing plastic 
clip to our finger.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.610
Suddenly, a digital screen reads out 
the oxygen level in our bloodstream.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.884
How did that happen?

00:00:25.884 --> 00:00:29.234
How can a plastic clip learn something 
about our blood…

00:00:29.234 --> 00:00:31.084
without a blood sample?

00:00:31.084 --> 00:00:32.164
Here’s the trick:

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:34.474
our bodies are translucent,

00:00:34.474 --> 00:00:38.304
meaning they don’t completely 
block and reflect light.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:42.374
Rather, they allow some light to actually
pass through our skin,

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:44.454
muscles, and blood vessels.

00:00:44.454 --> 00:00:45.564
Don’t believe it?

00:00:45.564 --> 00:00:47.924
Hold a flashlight to your thumb.

00:00:47.924 --> 00:00:52.814
Light, it turns out, can help probe the
insides of our bodies.

00:00:52.814 --> 00:00:55.193
Consider that medical fingerclip—

00:00:55.193 --> 00:00:57.553
it’s called a pulse oximeter.

00:00:57.553 --> 00:01:02.333
When you inhale, your lungs transfer 
oxygen into hemoglobin molecules,

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:09.123
and the pulse oximeter measures the ratio 
of oxygenated to oxygen-free hemoglobin.

00:01:09.123 --> 00:01:14.503
It does this by using a tiny red LED light
on one side of the fingerclip,

00:01:14.503 --> 00:01:17.234
and a small light detector on the other.

00:01:17.234 --> 00:01:19.664
When the LED shines into your finger,

00:01:19.664 --> 00:01:24.214
oxygen-free hemoglobin in your blood 
vessels absorbs the red light

00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:27.392
more strongly than its oxygenated 
counterpart.

00:01:27.392 --> 00:01:30.132
So the amount of light that makes
it out the other side

00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:35.112
depends on the concentration ratio 
of the two types of hemoglobin.

00:01:35.112 --> 00:01:39.372
But any two patients will have different-sized 
blood vessels in their fingers.

00:01:39.372 --> 00:01:43.366
For one patient, a saturation reading of 
ninety-five percent

00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:45.876
corresponds to a healthy oxygen level,

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:47.886
but for another with smaller arteries,

00:01:47.886 --> 00:01:53.056
the same reading could dangerously 
misrepresent the actual oxygen level.

00:01:53.056 --> 00:01:57.626
This can be accounted for with a second 
infrared wavelength LED.

00:01:57.626 --> 00:02:00.831
Light comes in a vast spectrum 
of wavelengths,

00:02:00.831 --> 00:02:04.741
and infrared light lies just beyond 
the visible colors.

00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:07.369
All molecules, including hemoglobin,

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.479
absorb light at different efficiencies 
across this spectrum.

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:15.129
So contrasting the absorbance of red 
to infrared light

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.609
provides a chemical fingerprint to 
eliminate the blood vessel size effect.

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:25.559
Today, an emerging medical sensor industry
is exploring all-new degrees

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:27.926
of precision chemical fingerprinting,

00:02:27.926 --> 00:02:32.816
using tiny light-manipulating devices 
no larger than a tenth of a millimeter.

00:02:32.816 --> 00:02:34.760
This microscopic technology,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.790
called integrated photonics,

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.170
is made from wires of silicon 
that guide light—

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.650
like water in a pipe—

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.080
to redirect, reshape, even 
temporarily trap it.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.100
A ring resonator device, 
which is a circular wire of silicon,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.870
is a light trapper that enhances chemical 
fingerprinting.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.220
When placed close to a silicon wire,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.200
a ring siphons off and temporarily stores 
only certain waves of light—

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.918
those whose periodic wavelength 
fits a whole number of times

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:06.518
along the ring’s circumference.

00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:10.588
It’s the same effect at work when
we pluck guitar strings.

00:03:10.588 --> 00:03:15.058
Only certain vibrating patterns dominate 
a string of a particular length,

00:03:15.058 --> 00:03:18.038
to give a fundamental 
note and its overtones.

00:03:18.038 --> 00:03:20.578
Ring resonators were originally 
designed

00:03:20.578 --> 00:03:23.598
to efficiently route different 
wavelengths of light—

00:03:23.598 --> 00:03:25.908
each a channel of digital data—

00:03:25.908 --> 00:03:28.908
in fiber optics communication networks.

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:31.778
But some day this kind of data 
traffic routing

00:03:31.778 --> 00:03:35.218
may be adapted for miniature chemical
fingerprinting labs,

00:03:35.218 --> 00:03:37.898
on chips the size of a penny.

00:03:37.898 --> 00:03:41.168
These future labs-on-a-chip may easily, 
rapidly,

00:03:41.168 --> 00:03:44.688
and non-invasively detect a host 
of illnesses,

00:03:44.688 --> 00:03:48.488
by analyzing human saliva or sweat 
in a doctor’s office

00:03:48.488 --> 00:03:50.958
or the convenience of our homes.

00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:53.068
Human saliva in particular

00:03:53.068 --> 00:03:56.768
mirrors the composition of our bodies’ 
proteins and hormones,

00:03:56.768 --> 00:04:00.268
and can give early-warning signals for 
certain cancers

00:04:00.268 --> 00:04:03.348
and infectious and autoimmune diseases.

00:04:03.348 --> 00:04:05.788
To accurately identify an illness,

00:04:05.788 --> 00:04:08.498
labs-on-a-chip may rely on 
several methods,

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.388
including chemical fingerprinting,

00:04:10.388 --> 00:04:15.138
to sift through the large mix of trace 
substances in a sample of spit.

00:04:15.138 --> 00:04:19.938
Various biomolecules in saliva absorb 
light at the same wavelength—

00:04:19.938 --> 00:04:22.888
but each has a distinct chemical 
fingerprint.

00:04:22.888 --> 00:04:26.988
In a lab-on-a-chip, after the light passes
through a saliva sample,

00:04:26.988 --> 00:04:29.138
a host of fine-tuned rings

00:04:29.138 --> 00:04:32.698
may each siphon off a slightly different
wavelength of light

00:04:32.698 --> 00:04:35.458
and send it to a partner light detector.

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:38.518
Together, this bank of detectors will 
resolve

00:04:38.518 --> 00:04:41.298
the cumulative chemical fingerprint 
of the sample.

00:04:41.298 --> 00:04:44.358
From this information, 
a tiny on-chip computer,

00:04:44.358 --> 00:04:47.988
containing a library of chemical 
fingerprints for different molecules,

00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:50.548
may figure out their relative 
concentrations,

00:04:50.548 --> 00:04:53.278
and help diagnose a specific illness.

00:04:53.648 --> 00:04:57.168
From globe-trotting communications 
to labs-on-a-chip,

00:04:57.168 --> 00:05:02.468
humankind has repurposed light to both 
carry and extract information.

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:07.103
Its ability to illuminate continues 
to astonish us with new discoveries.
