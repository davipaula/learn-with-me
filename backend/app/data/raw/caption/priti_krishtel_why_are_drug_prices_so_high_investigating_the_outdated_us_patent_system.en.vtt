00:00:13.135 --> 00:00:16.952
For my husband,
it was love at first sight.

00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:18.246
(Laughter)

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.865
Here's what happened.

00:00:19.889 --> 00:00:21.839
Years ago, Rudy,

00:00:21.863 --> 00:00:25.926
who I had strictly put
in the friend zone at the time,

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.410
came over to my house and met my dad,

00:00:28.434 --> 00:00:31.552
a pharmaceutical scientist
who had just retired

00:00:31.576 --> 00:00:33.783
after bringing a drug to market.

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:35.672
My dad said,

00:00:35.696 --> 00:00:37.747
"Ah, you probably
wouldn't have heard of it.

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.302
It's for IPF,

00:00:39.326 --> 00:00:42.334
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis."

00:00:42.644 --> 00:00:46.564
Rudy paused for a long time,
and then he said,

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:51.065
"That's the disease that took
my father's life 15 years ago."

00:00:52.016 --> 00:00:55.103
Rudy says that this
is the moment he fell in love.

00:00:55.127 --> 00:00:56.895
(Laughter)

00:00:56.919 --> 00:00:58.071
With my father.

00:00:58.095 --> 00:01:00.243
(Laughter)

00:01:00.847 --> 00:01:04.339
Even though it was too late
for my dad to save his,

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:08.186
he felt that destiny had delivered us
this full-circle moment.

00:01:09.224 --> 00:01:13.565
In my family, we have a special love
for my father's inventions.

00:01:13.589 --> 00:01:16.950
And in particular, we have
a reverence for his patents.

00:01:17.498 --> 00:01:21.459
We have framed patents
on the wall in our house.

00:01:21.887 --> 00:01:26.547
And there's a recognition in our family
that everything I've been able to do --

00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:29.936
college, law school,
health justice work --

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.285
all of it is because America
enabled my father

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:36.661
to fulfill his potential as an inventor.

00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:41.919
(Applause)

00:01:42.363 --> 00:01:46.042
Last year, I met the director
of the US Patent Office

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:47.257
for the first time,

00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:50.956
and I sent my family a selfie
from that office in Virginia.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.981
(Laughter)

00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:53.900
I got so many emojis back,

00:01:53.924 --> 00:01:56.325
you would have thought I had met BeyoncÃ©.

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:57.647
(Laughter)

00:01:58.187 --> 00:01:59.347
But truth be told,

00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:01.752
I was actually there
to talk about a problem --

00:02:01.776 --> 00:02:06.831
how our outdated patent system
is fueling the high cost of medicines

00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:08.632
and costing lives.

00:02:09.315 --> 00:02:13.672
Today, over two billion people
live without access to medicines.

00:02:13.696 --> 00:02:15.656
And against this global crisis,

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.926
drug prices are skyrocketing,

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.331
including in wealthier countries.

00:02:20.355 --> 00:02:25.176
Thirty-four million Americans
have lost a family member or a friend

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.057
in the last five years,

00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:29.382
not because the treatment didn't exist,

00:02:29.406 --> 00:02:31.663
but because they couldn't afford it.

00:02:32.287 --> 00:02:36.224
Rising drug costs are pushing
families into homelessness,

00:02:36.248 --> 00:02:38.581
seniors into bankruptcy

00:02:38.605 --> 00:02:42.938
and parents to crowdfunding treatment
for their critically ill children.

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.990
There are many reasons for this crisis,

00:02:47.014 --> 00:02:50.418
but one is the outdated patent system

00:02:50.442 --> 00:02:54.109
that America tries to export
to the rest of the world.

00:02:55.026 --> 00:02:57.689
The original intention
behind the patent system

00:02:57.713 --> 00:03:00.240
was to motivate people to invent

00:03:00.264 --> 00:03:03.852
by rewarding them
with a time-limited monopoly.

00:03:03.876 --> 00:03:08.177
But today, that intention
has been distorted beyond recognition.

00:03:08.661 --> 00:03:11.884
Corporations have teams
of lawyers and lobbyists

00:03:11.908 --> 00:03:17.192
whose sole job is to extend
patent protection as long as possible.

00:03:17.795 --> 00:03:20.731
And they've kept the patent office busy.

00:03:20.755 --> 00:03:24.403
It took 155 years for the US Patent Office

00:03:24.427 --> 00:03:27.125
to issue its first five million patents.

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:32.228
It took just 27 years
for it to issue the next five million.

00:03:32.704 --> 00:03:35.795
We haven't gotten
drastically more inventive.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.477
Corporations have gotten
drastically better at gaming the system.

00:03:40.946 --> 00:03:43.200
Drug patents have exploded --

00:03:43.224 --> 00:03:47.931
between 2006 and 2016, they doubled.

00:03:48.246 --> 00:03:49.976
But consider this:

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:56.310
The vast majority of medicines
associated with new drug patents

00:03:56.334 --> 00:03:57.593
are not new.

00:03:57.617 --> 00:04:01.688
Nearly eight out of 10
are for existing ones,

00:04:01.712 --> 00:04:04.656
like insulin or aspirin.

00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:08.926
My organization,
a team of lawyers and scientists,

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.529
recently conducted an investigation
into the 12 best-selling drugs in America.

00:04:14.553 --> 00:04:16.664
We found that, on average,

00:04:16.688 --> 00:04:21.759
there are 125 patents
filed on each medicine.

00:04:22.204 --> 00:04:25.395
Often for things we've known
how to do for decades,

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.278
like putting two pills into one.

00:04:28.855 --> 00:04:31.966
The higher a patent wall a company builds,

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.626
the longer they hold on to their monopoly.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.951
And with no one to compete with,

00:04:36.975 --> 00:04:39.292
they can set prices at whim.

00:04:39.316 --> 00:04:41.308
And because these are medicines

00:04:41.332 --> 00:04:43.419
and not designer watches,

00:04:43.443 --> 00:04:45.991
we have no choice but to pay.

00:04:46.678 --> 00:04:50.693
The patent wall is a strategy
to block competition.

00:04:51.075 --> 00:04:54.268
Not for the 14 years maximum

00:04:54.292 --> 00:04:57.963
that America's founders
originally envisioned,

00:04:57.987 --> 00:05:01.371
or the 20 years allowed by law today,

00:05:01.395 --> 00:05:04.402
but for 40 years or more.

00:05:04.854 --> 00:05:08.679
Meanwhile, prices on these drugs
have continued to increase --

00:05:08.703 --> 00:05:11.632
68 percent since 2012.

00:05:12.306 --> 00:05:16.021
That's seven times the rate of inflation.

00:05:16.728 --> 00:05:19.347
And people are struggling or even dying,

00:05:19.371 --> 00:05:21.704
because they can't afford the meds.

00:05:22.912 --> 00:05:25.444
Now I want to be really clear
about something.

00:05:25.468 --> 00:05:29.499
This isn't about making
the pharmaceutical industry the bad guy.

00:05:29.523 --> 00:05:31.659
What I'm talking about today

00:05:31.683 --> 00:05:35.677
is whether the system we created
to promote progress

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:38.264
is actually working as intended.

00:05:39.121 --> 00:05:43.034
Sure, the pharmaceutical companies
are gaming the system,

00:05:43.058 --> 00:05:46.016
but they're gaming it because they can.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.656
Because we have failed
to adapt this system

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.127
to meet today's realities.

00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:53.755
The government is handing out

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:57.093
one of the most prized
rewards in business --

00:05:57.117 --> 00:06:02.466
the opportunity to create a product
that is protected from competition --

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.236
and asking for less and less
in return on our behalf.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.720
Imagine awarding 100 Pulitzer Prizes
to one author for the same book.

00:06:12.744 --> 00:06:14.021
(Murmurs)

00:06:14.735 --> 00:06:16.695
It doesn't have to be this way.

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:19.776
We can create a modern patent system

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.219
to meet the needs
of a 21st-century society.

00:06:23.243 --> 00:06:24.442
And to do that,

00:06:24.466 --> 00:06:27.823
we need to reimagine the patent system
to serve the public,

00:06:27.847 --> 00:06:29.934
not just corporations.

00:06:30.736 --> 00:06:32.003
So how do we do it?

00:06:32.752 --> 00:06:34.172
Five reforms.

00:06:34.633 --> 00:06:38.332
First, we need to stop
handing out so many patents.

00:06:39.077 --> 00:06:41.181
Back under the Kennedy administration,

00:06:41.205 --> 00:06:44.753
in an effort to curb rising drug costs,

00:06:44.777 --> 00:06:47.738
a congressman from Tennessee
proposed an idea.

00:06:48.211 --> 00:06:49.528
He said,

00:06:49.552 --> 00:06:51.156
"If you want to tweak a drug,

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.576
and you want to get another patent on it,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.768
the modified version has to be
significantly better, therapeutically,

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:58.942
for patients."

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.037
Because of intense lobbying,

00:07:01.061 --> 00:07:03.528
this idea never saw the light of day.

00:07:04.464 --> 00:07:07.075
But a reimagined patent system

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:12.123
would resurrect and evolve
this simple, yet elegant proposition.

00:07:12.147 --> 00:07:13.543
That to get a patent,

00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:16.813
you have to invent something
substantially better

00:07:16.837 --> 00:07:18.892
than what's already out there.

00:07:18.916 --> 00:07:21.241
This shouldn't be controversial.

00:07:21.265 --> 00:07:22.662
As a society,

00:07:22.686 --> 00:07:26.918
we reserve the big rewards
for the big ideas.

00:07:26.942 --> 00:07:31.109
We don't give Michelin stars
to chefs who just tweak a recipe --

00:07:31.133 --> 00:07:35.555
we give them to chefs who change
how we think about food.

00:07:35.579 --> 00:07:38.602
And yet, we hand out patents
worth billions of dollars

00:07:38.626 --> 00:07:40.499
for minor changes.

00:07:40.523 --> 00:07:42.323
It's time to raise the bar.

00:07:43.499 --> 00:07:45.077
Second,

00:07:45.101 --> 00:07:49.514
we need to change the financial incentives
of the Patent Office.

00:07:49.538 --> 00:07:52.093
Right now, the revenue
of the Patent Office

00:07:52.117 --> 00:07:56.013
is directly linked to the number
of patents that it grants.

00:07:57.292 --> 00:08:02.879
That's like private prisons
getting paid more to hold more people --

00:08:02.903 --> 00:08:06.680
it naturally leads to more incarceration,

00:08:06.704 --> 00:08:08.101
not less.

00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:10.696
The same is true for patents.

00:08:12.173 --> 00:08:16.069
Third, we need more public participation.

00:08:16.093 --> 00:08:19.180
Right now, the patent system
is like a black box.

00:08:19.204 --> 00:08:24.629
It's a two-way conversation
between the patent office and industry.

00:08:24.653 --> 00:08:27.700
You and I aren't invited to that party.

00:08:28.454 --> 00:08:30.541
But imagine if instead,

00:08:30.565 --> 00:08:36.197
the Patent Office became a dynamic center
for citizen learning and ingenuity,

00:08:36.221 --> 00:08:40.269
staffed not just by technical
experts and bureaucrats,

00:08:40.293 --> 00:08:43.706
but also by great
public-health storytellers

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.109
with a passion for science.

00:08:46.133 --> 00:08:50.056
Regular citizens could get
accessible information

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:52.087
about complex technologies

00:08:52.111 --> 00:08:55.940
like artificial intelligence
or gene editing,

00:08:55.964 --> 00:09:00.503
enabling us to participate
in the policy conversations

00:09:00.527 --> 00:09:03.963
that directly impact our health and lives.

00:09:05.948 --> 00:09:07.098
Fourth,

00:09:08.095 --> 00:09:10.761
we need to get the right to go to court.

00:09:11.245 --> 00:09:14.888
Right now in America,
after a patent is granted,

00:09:14.912 --> 00:09:17.570
the public has no legal standing.

00:09:17.895 --> 00:09:22.807
Only those with a commercial interest,
usually other drug companies,

00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:24.243
have that right.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.387
But I've witnessed firsthand
how lives can be saved

00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:31.831
when everyday citizens
have the right to go to court.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.929
Back in 2006 in India,

00:09:34.953 --> 00:09:38.072
my organization worked
with patient advocates

00:09:38.096 --> 00:09:42.493
to challenge, legally,
unjust HIV drug patents,

00:09:42.517 --> 00:09:45.450
at a time when so many people were dying,

00:09:45.474 --> 00:09:48.244
because medicines
were priced out of reach.

00:09:48.268 --> 00:09:50.806
We were able to bring down
the prices of medicines

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.982
by up to 87 percent.

00:09:53.006 --> 00:09:57.823
(Applause)

00:09:57.847 --> 00:09:59.735
On just three drugs,

00:09:59.759 --> 00:10:03.672
we were able to save health systems
half a billion dollars.

00:10:04.212 --> 00:10:09.276
Now, cases like these
can save millions of lives

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.410
and billions of dollars.

00:10:11.434 --> 00:10:15.253
Imagine if Americans
had the right to go to court, too.

00:10:17.259 --> 00:10:20.870
And lastly, we need stronger oversight.

00:10:21.969 --> 00:10:27.477
We need an independent unit
that can serve as a public advocate,

00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:30.969
regularly monitoring the activities
of the Patent Office

00:10:30.993 --> 00:10:32.949
and reporting to Congress.

00:10:33.592 --> 00:10:35.585
If a unit like this had existed,

00:10:35.609 --> 00:10:40.243
it would have caught, for example,
the Silicon Valley company Theranos

00:10:40.267 --> 00:10:44.022
before it got so many patents
for blood testing

00:10:44.046 --> 00:10:47.569
and landed an evaluation
of nine billion dollars,

00:10:47.593 --> 00:10:48.847
when in reality,

00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:51.271
there was no invention there at all.

00:10:51.673 --> 00:10:56.585
This kind of accountability
is going to become increasingly urgent.

00:10:56.609 --> 00:10:58.870
In the age of 23andMe,

00:10:58.894 --> 00:11:01.008
important questions are being asked

00:11:01.032 --> 00:11:04.291
about whether companies
can patent and sell

00:11:04.315 --> 00:11:07.980
our genetic information
and our patient data.

00:11:08.004 --> 00:11:10.678
We need to be part of those conversations

00:11:10.702 --> 00:11:12.281
before it's too late.

00:11:12.821 --> 00:11:17.109
Our information is being used
to create the new therapies.

00:11:17.133 --> 00:11:21.672
And when that moment of diagnosis
comes for me and my family,

00:11:21.696 --> 00:11:23.593
or for you and yours,

00:11:23.617 --> 00:11:27.834
are we going to have to crowdfund
to save the lives of those we love?

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.160
That's not the world I want to live in.

00:11:31.184 --> 00:11:34.584
It's not the world I want
for my two-year-old son.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:40.164
My dad is growing older now,

00:11:40.188 --> 00:11:44.985
and he is still as quietly brilliant
and morally directed as ever.

00:11:45.478 --> 00:11:49.390
Sometimes people ask us
whether things get heated between us:

00:11:49.414 --> 00:11:51.279
the patent-holding scientist

00:11:51.303 --> 00:11:54.036
and his patent-reforming lawyer daughter.

00:11:55.377 --> 00:11:59.978
It's such a profound misunderstanding
of what's at stake,

00:12:00.002 --> 00:12:03.981
because this is not
about scientists versus activists,

00:12:04.005 --> 00:12:06.716
or invention versus protection.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.788
This is about people,

00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:12.137
our quest to invent and our right to live.

00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:16.766
My dad and I understand
that our ingenuity and our dignity

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:19.257
go hand in hand.

00:12:19.281 --> 00:12:21.567
We are on the same side.

00:12:21.868 --> 00:12:25.098
It is time to reimagine a patent system

00:12:25.122 --> 00:12:27.304
that reflects that knowing.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:28.860
Thank you.

00:12:28.884 --> 00:12:33.500
(Applause)
