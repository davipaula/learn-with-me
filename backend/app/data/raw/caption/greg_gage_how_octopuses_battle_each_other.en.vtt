Greg Gage: The octopus is
a rather strange-looking animal

00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:17.216
that exhibits amazingly complex behaviors.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.336
They have the most impressive nervous
system in the entire invertebrate world.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.296
They have about a half a billion neurons

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.336
that are distributed
throughout their body,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.656
such that two-thirds of the neurons
are actually in its legs.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.016
Now mix this in with camouflaging cells,
jet propulsion and a razor-sharp beak,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.600
and you have all the makings
of a formidable predator.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.656
And then throw in the fact
that the octopus is a solitary creature,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.096
and suddenly, we have ourselves
a real cephalopod fight.

[DIY Neuroscience]

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.296
We know that almost all animals fight --
for food, for territory, for mates.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.376
The octopus is no different,
and knowing their fighting behavior

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.176
could help us better understand
these fascinating creatures

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.416
and how they interact.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.416
My friend Ilya has been observing
the classic fighting behavior

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.456
between California two-spot octopuses.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.936
Ilya Chugunov: Most people
think that it's "octopi,"

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.416
but that's actually incorrect.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.136
The correct plurals
are either "octopuses" or "octopodes"

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.016
if you want to be very Greek about it.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.856
GG: So how do you do your experiment?

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.656
IC: First, I like to set up
the chamber just so it's ready,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.336
so I get a jug of water,
I aerate it by shaking the jug.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.656
It seems that if the water is
well-aerated, they're a lot more active.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.856
This gives the octopuses
some room to breathe.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.136
I get the first octopus --

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.576
Here, buddy. Here, pal.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.136
Put it in, set up my GoPro,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.250
put the second octopus in,
cover it up and leave it alone.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.050
(Bell ringing)

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.810
Rule 1: There's always
an aggressor.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.416
There's always one octopus
on defense, one on offense.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.776
Usually the one that's taking up
more space, that's more boastful,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.976
definitely the aggressor,
most likely the winner of the fight.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.416
The loser's pretty obvious.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.616
They get pushed around,
they curl up, hide in a corner.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.936
A lot of the time,
when there's initial contact,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.976
if one of them is too much
on the defensive side,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.736
the second one will sort of poke at it,
grab at its tentacle and see,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.496
"Hey, do you want to fight me,
do you want to turn around?

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.456
Do you want to start a wrestling match?"

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.240
So it'll just poke and run away.
Come back, poke and run away.

00:02:09.818 --> 00:02:10.550
(Bell ringing)

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.600
Rule 2: Avoid eye contact.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.416
When the octopuses come
towards each other to begin the fight,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.536
they don't actually face each other.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.295
They approach sideways.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.896
The defensive octopus
tries to face away from the attacker

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.696
until it's the critical moment
it knows there's no way to avoid a fight.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.176
GG: Really, the one who's waiting
to the last moment

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.440
is the defensive octopus.

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:35.480
(Bell ringing)

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.530
Rule 3: Flash your colors.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.136
The aggressor in a fight will quickly
and sharply flash bright black on his arms

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.480
when he's about to initiate a fight.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.776
(Bell ringing)

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.056
GG: Ooh, and already --

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.680
IC: We're seeing some action.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.496
Looks like they've spotted each other.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.536
GG: Right. So now he's going to come --
He's approaching, but not directly at him.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.400
IC: Yeah, they're like
almost completely antiparallel.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.456
GG: And then right there --

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.416
IC: Yeah. They contact,
and then their arms clash together.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.338
(String music)

00:03:20.044 --> 00:03:23.616
GG: So we've taken the first steps
in understanding fighting in the octopus.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.496
And you might be asking yourself:
Why does this even matter?

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.936
Well, these types of curiosity-based
research questions can often lead

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.696
to some unexpected
insights and discoveries.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.776
We've learned a lot about ourselves
from studying marine animals.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.656
Squid have taught us
about how our neurons communicate,

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.576
and the horseshoe crab
has taught us about how our eyes work.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.816
So it's not too far of a stretch to say
that some of these behaviors

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.280
that we're seeing in the California
two-spot octopus are similar to ours.
