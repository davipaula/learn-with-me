00:00:13.754 --> 00:00:18.420
There are 200 million clinical cases

00:00:18.444 --> 00:00:22.847
of falciparum malaria
in Africa every year,

00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:25.791
resulting in half a million deaths.

00:00:26.395 --> 00:00:30.204
I would like to talk to you
about malaria vaccines.

00:00:30.807 --> 00:00:36.405
The ones that we have made to date
are simply not good enough.

00:00:36.998 --> 00:00:38.148
Why?

00:00:38.474 --> 00:00:42.458
We've been working at it
for 100 plus years.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.556
When we started, technology was limited.

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:53.847
We could see just a tiny fraction
of what the parasite really looked like.

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:57.831
Today, we are awash with technology,

00:00:57.855 --> 00:01:01.910
advanced imaging and omics platforms --

00:01:01.934 --> 00:01:06.144
genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.493
These tools have given us a clearer view

00:01:10.517 --> 00:01:14.810
of just how complex
the parasite really is.

00:01:15.365 --> 00:01:17.992
However, in spite of this,

00:01:18.016 --> 00:01:23.516
our approach to vaccine design
has remained pretty rudimentary.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.460
To make a good vaccine,
we must go back to basics

00:01:28.484 --> 00:01:33.009
to understand how our bodies
handle this complexity.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.657
People who are frequently
infected with malaria

00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:40.148
learn to deal with it.

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.990
They get the infection,
but they don't get ill.

00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:48.307
The recipe is encoded in antibodies.

00:01:48.903 --> 00:01:52.887
My team went back to our complex parasite,

00:01:52.911 --> 00:01:57.839
probed it with samples from Africans
who had overcome malaria

00:01:57.863 --> 00:01:59.688
to answer the question:

00:01:59.712 --> 00:02:03.759
"What does a successful
antibody response look like?"

00:02:04.212 --> 00:02:07.514
We found over 200 proteins,

00:02:07.538 --> 00:02:11.751
many of which are not
on the radar for malaria vaccines.

00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:17.323
My research community may be missing out
important parts of the parasite.

00:02:18.283 --> 00:02:23.548
Until recently, when one had identified
a protein of interest,

00:02:23.572 --> 00:02:27.175
they tested whether it might be
important for a vaccine

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:29.628
by conducting a cohort study.

00:02:30.307 --> 00:02:35.879
This typically involved about 300
participants in a village in Africa,

00:02:35.903 --> 00:02:38.712
whose samples were analyzed to see

00:02:38.736 --> 00:02:44.442
whether antibodies to the protein
would predict who got malaria

00:02:44.466 --> 00:02:45.712
and who did not.

00:02:46.323 --> 00:02:48.426
In the past 30 years,

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.228
these studies have tested
a small number of proteins

00:02:53.252 --> 00:02:55.624
in relatively few samples

00:02:55.648 --> 00:02:58.315
and usually in single locations.

00:02:58.782 --> 00:03:01.861
The results have not been consistent.

00:03:02.956 --> 00:03:09.037
My team essentially collapsed
30 years of this type of research

00:03:09.061 --> 00:03:14.002
into one exciting experiment,
conducted over just three months.

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.831
Innovatively, we assembled 10,000 samples

00:03:18.855 --> 00:03:23.268
from 15 locations
in seven African countries,

00:03:23.292 --> 00:03:27.514
spanning time, age
and the variable intensity

00:03:27.538 --> 00:03:30.220
of malaria experienced in Africa.

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:36.244
We used omics intelligence
to prioritize our parasite proteins,

00:03:36.268 --> 00:03:38.268
synthesize them in the lab

00:03:38.292 --> 00:03:43.096
and in short, recreated
the malaria parasite on a chip.

00:03:43.585 --> 00:03:47.052
We did this in Africa,
and we're very proud of that.

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:53.554
(Applause)

00:03:53.578 --> 00:03:56.689
The chip is a small glass slide,

00:03:56.713 --> 00:03:59.109
but it gives us incredible power.

00:04:00.007 --> 00:04:06.174
We simultaneously gathered data
on over 100 antibody responses.

00:04:06.592 --> 00:04:08.192
What are we looking for?

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:13.314
The recipe behind a successful
antibody response,

00:04:13.338 --> 00:04:17.703
so that we can predict
what might make a good malaria vaccine.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.553
We're also trying to figure out

00:04:20.577 --> 00:04:24.124
exactly what antibodies
do to the parasite.

00:04:24.482 --> 00:04:26.037
How do they kill it?

00:04:26.061 --> 00:04:29.783
Do they attack from multiple angles?
Is there synergy?

00:04:29.807 --> 00:04:31.807
How much antibody do you need?

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:38.077
Our studies suggest that having
a bit of one antibody won't be enough.

00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:41.641
It might take high
concentrations of antibodies

00:04:41.665 --> 00:04:44.181
against multiple parasite proteins.

00:04:44.673 --> 00:04:49.688
We're also learning that antibodies
kill the parasite in multiple ways,

00:04:49.712 --> 00:04:55.656
and studying any one of these in isolation
may not adequately reflect reality.

00:04:56.454 --> 00:05:00.930
Just like we can now see the parasite
in greater definition,

00:05:00.954 --> 00:05:02.946
my team and I are focused

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.707
on understanding how our bodies
overcome this complexity.

00:05:08.012 --> 00:05:12.449
We believe that this could provide
the breakthroughs that we need

00:05:12.473 --> 00:05:16.209
to make malaria history
through vaccination.

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:17.870
Thank you.

00:05:17.894 --> 00:05:19.597
(Applause)

00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:22.017
(Cheers)

00:05:22.041 --> 00:05:27.793
(Applause)

00:05:27.817 --> 00:05:31.304
Shoham Arad: OK, how close
are we actually to a malaria vaccine?

00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:35.138
Faith Osier: We're just
at the beginning of a process

00:05:35.162 --> 00:05:39.146
to try and understand
what we need to put in the vaccine

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.703
before we actually start making it.

00:05:41.727 --> 00:05:45.560
So, we're not really close to the vaccine,
but we're getting there.

00:05:45.584 --> 00:05:46.825
SA: And we're hopeful.

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:48.649
FO: And we're very hopeful.

00:05:49.323 --> 00:05:52.569
SA: Tell me about SMART,
tell me what does it stand for

00:05:52.593 --> 00:05:54.633
and why is it important to you?

00:05:54.657 --> 00:06:01.040
FO: So SMART stands for South-South
Malaria Antigen Research Partnership.

00:06:01.477 --> 00:06:05.739
The South-South
is referring to us in Africa,

00:06:05.763 --> 00:06:10.268
looking sideways to each other
in collaboration,

00:06:10.292 --> 00:06:14.498
in contrast to always looking to America
and looking to Europe,

00:06:14.522 --> 00:06:17.559
when there is quite
some strength within Africa.

00:06:17.997 --> 00:06:19.161
So in SMART,

00:06:19.185 --> 00:06:23.125
apart from the goal that we have,
to develop a malaria vaccine,

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:25.594
we are also training African scientists,

00:06:25.618 --> 00:06:28.847
because the burden
of disease in Africa is high,

00:06:28.871 --> 00:06:32.834
and you need people who will continue
to push the boundaries

00:06:32.858 --> 00:06:34.516
in science, in Africa.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.586
SA: Yes, yes, correct.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.801
(Applause)

00:06:40.053 --> 00:06:41.601
OK, one last question.

00:06:41.625 --> 00:06:44.379
Tell me, I know you
mentioned this a little bit,

00:06:44.403 --> 00:06:47.657
but how would things actually change
if there were a malaria vaccine?

00:06:48.732 --> 00:06:52.470
FO: We would save
half a million lives every year.

00:06:53.256 --> 00:06:55.082
Two hundred million cases.

00:06:55.106 --> 00:07:01.914
It's estimated that malaria costs Africa
12 billion US dollars a year.

00:07:02.278 --> 00:07:03.674
So this is economics.

00:07:03.698 --> 00:07:05.966
Africa would simply thrive.

00:07:06.626 --> 00:07:08.127
SA: OK. Thank you, Faith.

00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:09.349
Thank you so much.

00:07:09.373 --> 00:07:10.769
(Applause)
