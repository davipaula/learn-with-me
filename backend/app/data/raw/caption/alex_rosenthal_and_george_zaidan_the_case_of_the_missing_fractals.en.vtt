00:00:18.925 --> 00:00:20.895
It was a night like any other night,

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:23.311
except here I was climbing the platonic peaks

00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:25.263
like Romeo on a second date.

00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:28.206
(ugh)

00:00:29.453 --> 00:00:32.110
I was there for the dame.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.597
She had eyes like imaginary numbers

00:00:33.597 --> 00:00:36.270
and curves that went on forever.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.186
Said she wanted to go home.

00:00:38.186 --> 00:00:39.622
Said I could help.

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:41.788
Said the pay was good.

00:00:41.788 --> 00:00:43.123
Didn't say anything about climbing a...

00:00:43.123 --> 00:00:44.816
Voice: "Who's there?"

00:00:44.816 --> 00:00:47.595
Manny Brot: "Manny Brot, private eye."

00:00:47.595 --> 00:00:49.625
Voice: "What are you doing here?"

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:52.482
"A pretty number sent me to find a stolen dingus."

00:00:52.482 --> 00:00:54.140
Voice: "Well, to enter the cave,

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.778
you must answer my riddles three."

00:00:56.778 --> 00:00:58.029
What was it with riddles,

00:00:58.029 --> 00:01:00.208
and why do they always come in threes?

00:01:00.208 --> 00:01:01.473
"Is it an egg?"

00:01:01.473 --> 00:01:03.224
"No. Why would it be an egg?"

00:01:03.224 --> 00:01:04.870
"It's usually an egg."

00:01:06.296 --> 00:01:08.466
"What can I hold in my hand, but has zero area?"

00:01:11.223 --> 00:01:12.514
"Is it a dodo egg?"

00:01:12.514 --> 00:01:13.681
"It's not an egg!"

00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:15.518
I took out the rock that had nearly brained me before

00:01:15.518 --> 00:01:17.329
and gave it a hard ponder.

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:18.937
The size of the rising bump on my conk

00:01:18.937 --> 00:01:21.272
said to me that this thing had area,

00:01:21.272 --> 00:01:23.078
and a lot of it.

00:01:23.078 --> 00:01:25.995
But what if I carved out a triangle from this side here?

00:01:25.995 --> 00:01:27.245
As any mook could see,

00:01:27.245 --> 00:01:30.994
this triangle had a quarter of the area of the full triangle.

00:01:30.994 --> 00:01:33.495
I did the same thing again with each of the smaller triangles.

00:01:33.495 --> 00:01:36.911
Again, a quarter of the remaining area -- gone.

00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:38.792
And I just kept going.

00:01:38.792 --> 00:01:40.494
After an infinite number of cuts,

00:01:40.494 --> 00:01:43.713
I was satisfied that my triangle had zero area.

00:01:43.713 --> 00:01:47.057
A bounded shape with zero area.

00:01:47.057 --> 00:01:49.224
Now, it's not often that I surprise myself,

00:01:49.224 --> 00:01:52.389
but my own two mitts had created something crazy,

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:54.264
and new.

00:01:54.264 --> 00:01:55.766
"Very good. (ahem)

00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:58.602
Now, show me a shape with finite area,

00:01:58.602 --> 00:02:01.939
but an infinitely long perimeter."

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.495
"Let me get this straight.

00:02:03.495 --> 00:02:05.578
If I want to make a snip in the border of this shape,

00:02:05.578 --> 00:02:07.319
smooth it out, and lay it on the ground ... "

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:08.160
"It would go on for ... "

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.198
"Wait 'til I'm through, and then you can talk.

00:02:11.198 --> 00:02:13.449
It would go on forever."

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:15.570
"Are you through?"

00:02:16.924 --> 00:02:17.788
"Yeah."

00:02:17.788 --> 00:02:19.829
"So show me that shape then."

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.994
Mmm ... I hadn't been this stuck

00:02:21.994 --> 00:02:25.130
since the Rubik's Cube fiasco of '58.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.719
All the shapes I knew had perimeters.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:30.601
Circles: 2Ï€r. Triangles: sum of their sides.

00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:31.828
What's this?

00:02:31.828 --> 00:02:33.245
An angle.

00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:35.598
An angle from heaven.

00:02:35.598 --> 00:02:38.523
What if I were to pinch each side, like so.

00:02:38.523 --> 00:02:41.079
A third of the way through, just so.

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.579
And do it again,

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.911
and again,

00:02:43.911 --> 00:02:45.661
and again.

00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:48.495
After each pinch, the perimeter got a third longer

00:02:48.495 --> 00:02:51.029
because where there had been three line segments,

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:53.495
now there were four.

00:02:53.495 --> 00:02:54.827
As for the area,

00:02:54.827 --> 00:02:57.161
every pinch made more triangles, that's true.

00:02:57.161 --> 00:03:00.956
But those triangles were getting smaller and smaller.

00:03:00.956 --> 00:03:02.957
You could say that the area was converging,

00:03:02.957 --> 00:03:04.494
approaching a fixed number,

00:03:04.494 --> 00:03:06.829
while the perimeter was just getting bigger and bigger,

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.328
uncontrollably ballooning like an overindulgent birthday clown.

00:03:11.328 --> 00:03:15.302
After infinity pinches, flimflam, there it was:

00:03:15.302 --> 00:03:19.160
Finite area, but infinite perimeter.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.162
Now that is a piece of work.

00:03:21.162 --> 00:03:24.771
"Oh, you're good. (ahem) Riddle three:

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:27.578
Show me a picture that if I magnify it under my microscope,

00:03:27.578 --> 00:03:29.945
I'll keep seeing the original picture,

00:03:29.945 --> 00:03:32.328
no matter how much I zoom in."

00:03:32.328 --> 00:03:34.199
"You're a strange little man."

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:35.867
"Thank you."

00:03:35.867 --> 00:03:37.078
I was out of ideas,

00:03:37.078 --> 00:03:39.872
so I looked at my muse, my complex Dora.

00:03:39.872 --> 00:03:41.205
Voice: "Who's the dame?"

00:03:41.205 --> 00:03:42.660
And then it hit me.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.791
"She's a heart breaker, my fractal femme fatale.

00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:46.910
Will she do?"

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.044
"Yes, she'll do just fine."

00:03:50.044 --> 00:03:52.228
(lightning)

00:03:53.178 --> 00:03:56.312
It was dark, and at first I thought the cave was empty,

00:03:56.312 --> 00:04:00.311
but then I noticed: the box.

00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:02.186
The dame had played me like a triangle.

00:04:02.186 --> 00:04:04.934
She had told me she wanted to go home.

00:04:04.934 --> 00:04:06.952
(Lightning)

00:04:06.952 --> 00:04:10.430
What she really wanted was to bring her home here.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.878
The fractals spread everywhere.

00:04:11.878 --> 00:04:12.813
Most of them the same

00:04:12.813 --> 00:04:14.710
no matter how deep you looked at them,

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.483
like Dora's mugshot.

00:04:16.483 --> 00:04:18.670
Some had infinitely long perimeters,

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.570
others were objects with no area or volume,

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.379
all of them created through infinite repetition.

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:26.307
So, you wanted to know what fractals are?

00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:30.164
Well, kid, they're the stuff that dreams are made of.

00:04:30.164 --> 00:04:38.724
