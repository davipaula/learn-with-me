00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.320
I come from Egypt,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.880
which is also called Umm al-Dunya,
the Mother of the World.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.696
It's a rich country
filled with stories of rebellion,

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.096
stories of civilizational
triumph and downfall

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.736
and the rich, religious,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.440
ethnic, cultural and linguistic diversity.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.536
Growing up in such an environment,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.520
I became a strong believer
in the power of storytelling.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.696
As I searched for the medium
with which to tell my story,

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.560
I stumbled upon graphic design.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.656
I would like to share with you a project

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.336
of how graphic design
can bring the Arabic language to life.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.720
But first, let me tell you
why I want to do this.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.480
I believe that graphic design
can change the world.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.096
At least in my very own city of Cairo,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.920
it helped overthrow
two separate dictators.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.936
As you can see from those photos,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.336
the power and potential of graphic design
as a tool for positive change

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.800
is undeniably strong.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.760
Egypt's 2011 revolution
was also a grassroots design revolution.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.360
Everyone became a creator.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.176
People were the real designers

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.696
and, just overnight,

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.296
Cairo was flooded with posters,

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.400
signage, graffiti.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.856
Visual communication

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.056
was the medium that spoke
far louder than words

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.296
when the population of over
90 million voices were suppressed

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.960
for almost 30 years.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.496
It was precisely this political
and social suppression,

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.536
coupled with decades of colonialism

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.336
and miseducation

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.216
that slowly eroded the significance
of the Arabic script in the region.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.816
All of these countries once used Arabic.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.602
Now it's just the green and the blue.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.656
To put it simply,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.360
the Arabic script is dying.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.736
In postcolonial Arab countries functioning
in an increasingly globalized world,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.296
it is a growing alarm

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.200
that less and less people are using
the Arabic script to communicate.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.376
As I was studying my master's in Italy,
I noticed myself missing Arabic.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.336
I missed looking at the letters,

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.176
digesting their meaning.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.536
So one day, I walked into
one of the biggest libraries in Italy

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.160
in search of an Arabic book.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.536
I was surprised to find
that this is what they had

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.960
under the category of
"Arabic/Middle Eastern books."

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.496
(Laughter)

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.360
Fear, terrorism and destruction.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.000
One word: ISIS.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.656
My heart ached

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.896
that this is how we are
portrayed to the world,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.960
even from a literary perspective.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.016
I asked myself: Whatever happened
to the world-renowned writers

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.200
like Naguib Mahfouz, Khalil Gibran,

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.200
iconic poets like Mutanabbi,
Nizar Qabbani?

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.616
Think about this.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.656
The cultural products
of an entire region of the world,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.976
as rich, as diverse,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.560
have been deemed redundant,

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.360
if not ignored altogether.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.576
The cultural products
of an entire region of the world

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.376
have been barred from imparting
any kind of real impact

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.640
on global media productions
and contemporary social discourse.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.936
And then I reminded myself
of my number one belief:

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.256
design can change the world.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.136
All you need is for someone
to catch a glimpse of your work,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.720
feel, connect.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.000
And so I started.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.776
I thought about how can I stop the world
from seeing us as evil,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.936
as terrorists of this planet,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.096
and start perceiving us as equals,

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.320
fellow humans?

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.816
How can I save and honor the Arabic script

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.320
and share it with
other people, other cultures?

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.136
And then it hit me:

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.976
What if I combined
the two most significant symbols

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.216
of innocence and Arab identity?

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.040
Maybe then people could resonate.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.656
What's more pure,
innocent and fun as LEGO?

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.256
It's a universal child's toy.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.576
You play with them, you build with them,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.200
and with them, you imagine
endless possibilities.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.616
My eureka moment was to find
a bilingual solution for Arabic education,

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.296
because effective
communication and education

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.096
is the road to more tolerant communities.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.416
However, the Arabic and Latin scripts
do not only represent different worlds

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.016
but also create technical difficulties
for both Eastern and Western communities

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.536
on a daily basis.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.456
There are so many reasons
why Arabic and Latin are different,

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.176
but here are some of the main ones.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.896
Yes, both use upward and downward strokes,

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.200
but have completely different baselines.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.416
Arabic tends to be more calligraphic

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.376
and connectivity is important
to the Arabic language,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.736
whose letters have to be mostly joined
in order to articulate a given word.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.336
It also uses an entirely different
system of punctuation and diacritics.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.416
But most importantly,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.576
Arabic has no capital letters.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.936
Instead it has four
different letter forms:

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.200
initial, medial, isolated and final.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.376
I want to introduce the Arabic language
to young learners, foreign speakers,

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.440
but most importantly help refugees
integrate to their host societies

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.896
through creating
a bilingual learning system,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.536
a two-way flow of communication.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.160
And I called it "Let's Play."

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.816
The idea is to simply create
a fun and engaging way of learning

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.000
Modern Standard Arabic through LEGO.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.496
These are the two words. "Let's Play."

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.200
Every colored bar marks an Arabic letter.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.376
As you can see, the letter
is explained in form, sound

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.816
and examples of words in function,

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.456
in addition to the equivalent in Latin.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.736
Together, they form a fun pocket book

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.216
with the 29 Arabic letters
and the four different forms,

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.160
plus a 400-word dictionary.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.936
So this is how the page looks like.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.416
You have the letter,
the transliteration in Latin

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.120
and the description underneath.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.820
I'll take you through the process.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.656
So first in my tiny studio in Florence,

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.136
I built the letters.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.976
I photographed each letter separately,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.976
and then I retouched every letter
and chose the correct color background

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.440
and typefaces to use.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.136
Ultimately, I created the full letter set,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.656
which is 29 letters
times four different forms.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.760
That's 116 letters build just in one week.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.320
I believe that information
should and can be fun, portable.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.616
This book is the final product,

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.976
which I would eventually like to publish

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.416
and translate into
as many languages in the world,

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:12.520
so that Arabic teaching and learning
becomes fun, easy and accessible globally.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.720
With this book, I hope to save
my nation's beautiful script.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.936
(Applause)

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.160
Thank you.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.016
Working on this project
was a form of visual meditation,

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.296
like a Sufi dance,

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.160
a prayer to a better planet.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.536
One set of building blocks
made two languages.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.160
LEGO is just a metaphor.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.216
It's because we are all made
of the same building unit,

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.136
is that I can see a future

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.960
where the barriers between people

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.400
all come tumbling down.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.456
So no matter how ugly
the world around us gets,

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.096
or how many discouraging books
on ISIS, the terrorist group,

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.296
and not Isis, the ancient
Egyptian goddess,

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.296
continue to be published,

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.960
I will keep building one colorful world.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.136
Shukran, which means "thank you."

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.776
(Applause)

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.416
Thank you. Thank you so much.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.640
Thank you.
