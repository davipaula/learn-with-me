00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:18.848
Alright, so I want you to imagine that you
get a text from a friend, and it reads ...

00:00:18.872 --> 00:00:22.808
"You will NOT believe what just happened.
I'm SO MAD right now!"

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.720
So you do the dutiful thing as a friend,
and you ask for details.

00:00:26.744 --> 00:00:29.283
And they tell you a story
about what happened to them

00:00:29.307 --> 00:00:31.747
at the gym or at work
or on their date last night.

00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:35.096
And you listen and you try
to understand why they're so mad.

00:00:35.548 --> 00:00:38.851
Maybe even secretly judge
whether or not they should be so mad.

00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:40.985
(Laughter)

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:43.085
And maybe you even offer some suggestions.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.649
Now, in that moment, you are doing
essentially what I get to do every day,

00:00:46.673 --> 00:00:48.553
because I'm an anger researcher,

00:00:48.577 --> 00:00:52.907
and as an anger researcher, I spend
a good part of my professional life --

00:00:52.931 --> 00:00:55.709
who am I kidding, also my personal life --

00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.542
studying why people get mad.

00:00:58.042 --> 00:01:00.788
I study the types of thoughts
they have when they get mad,

00:01:00.812 --> 00:01:03.093
and I even study what they do
when they get mad,

00:01:03.117 --> 00:01:05.585
whether it's getting into fights
or breaking things,

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:08.156
or even yelling at people
in all caps on the internet.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.164
(Laughter)

00:01:09.188 --> 00:01:10.554
And as you can imagine,

00:01:10.578 --> 00:01:12.561
when people hear I'm an anger researcher,

00:01:12.585 --> 00:01:14.585
they want to talk to me about their anger,

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:16.822
they want to share with me
their anger stories.

00:01:16.846 --> 00:01:18.847
And it's not because
they need a therapist,

00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:20.506
though that does sometimes happen,

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.410
it's really because anger is universal.

00:01:22.434 --> 00:01:25.537
It's something we all feel
and it's something they can relate to.

00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:28.268
We've been feeling it
since the first few months of life,

00:01:28.292 --> 00:01:31.514
when we didn't get what we wanted
in our cries of protests,

00:01:31.538 --> 00:01:34.903
things like, "What do you mean
you won't pick up the rattle, Dad,

00:01:34.927 --> 00:01:36.085
I want it!"

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:37.549
(Laughter)

00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:42.522
We feel it throughout our teenage years,
as my mom can certainly attest to with me.

00:01:42.546 --> 00:01:43.696
Sorry, Mom.

00:01:44.188 --> 00:01:45.993
We feel it to the very end.

00:01:46.017 --> 00:01:49.942
In fact, anger has been with us
at some of the worst moments of our lives.

00:01:50.321 --> 00:01:53.171
It's a natural and expected
part of our grief.

00:01:53.195 --> 00:01:56.408
But it's also been with us
in some of the best moments of our lives,

00:01:56.432 --> 00:01:59.448
with those special occasions
like weddings and vacations

00:01:59.472 --> 00:02:02.268
often marred by these everyday
frustrations --

00:02:02.292 --> 00:02:03.812
bad weather, travel delays --

00:02:03.836 --> 00:02:05.840
that feel horrible in the moment,

00:02:05.864 --> 00:02:09.140
but then are ultimately forgotten
when things go OK.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.776
I have a lot of conversations
with people about their anger

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.197
and it's through those conversations
that I've learned that many people,

00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:18.363
and I bet many people
in this room right now,

00:02:18.387 --> 00:02:19.680
you see anger as a problem.

00:02:19.704 --> 00:02:21.758
You see the way
it interferes in your life,

00:02:21.782 --> 00:02:24.926
the way it damages relationships,
maybe even the ways it's scary.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.156
And while I get all of that,
I see anger a little differently,

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.807
and today, I want to tell you
something really important

00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:32.363
about your anger, and it's this:

00:02:32.387 --> 00:02:35.799
anger is a powerful and healthy
force in your life.

00:02:35.823 --> 00:02:37.522
It's good that you feel it.

00:02:37.546 --> 00:02:38.879
You need to feel it.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:42.371
But to understand all that,
we actually have to back up

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:44.707
and talk about why we get mad
in the first place.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:47.493
A lot of this goes back to the work
of an anger researcher

00:02:47.517 --> 00:02:51.557
named Dr. Jerry Deffenbacher,
who wrote about this back in 1996

00:02:51.581 --> 00:02:54.260
in a book chapter on how to deal
with problematic anger.

00:02:54.284 --> 00:02:56.507
Now, for most of us,
and I bet most of you,

00:02:56.531 --> 00:02:58.473
it feels as simple as this:

00:02:58.497 --> 00:03:00.045
I get mad when I'm provoked.

00:03:00.506 --> 00:03:02.410
You hear it in the language people use.

00:03:02.434 --> 00:03:03.608
They say things like,

00:03:03.632 --> 00:03:05.998
"It makes me so mad
when people drive this slow,"

00:03:06.022 --> 00:03:10.067
or, "I got mad because she left
the milk out again."

00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:11.248
Or my favorite,

00:03:11.272 --> 00:03:14.918
"I don't have an anger problem --
people just need to stop messing with me."

00:03:14.942 --> 00:03:16.092
(Laughter)

00:03:16.527 --> 00:03:20.712
Now, in the spirit of better understanding
those types of provocations,

00:03:20.736 --> 00:03:24.998
I ask a lot of people, including
my friends and colleagues and even family,

00:03:25.022 --> 00:03:27.149
"What are the things
that really get to you?

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:28.514
What makes you mad?"

00:03:28.538 --> 00:03:31.625
By the way, now is a good time
to point out one of the advantages

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:32.998
of being an anger researcher

00:03:33.022 --> 00:03:36.299
is that I've spent more than a decade
generating a comprehensive list

00:03:36.323 --> 00:03:39.483
of all the things
that really irritate my colleagues.

00:03:39.507 --> 00:03:40.887
Just in case I need it.

00:03:40.911 --> 00:03:44.895
(Laughter)

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.078
But their answers are fascinating,

00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:49.537
because they say things like,

00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:51.537
"when my sports team loses,"

00:03:51.561 --> 00:03:53.958
"people who chew too loudly."

00:03:53.982 --> 00:03:56.410
That is surprisingly common, by the way.

00:03:56.434 --> 00:03:59.514
"People who walk too slowly,"
that one's mine.

00:03:59.974 --> 00:04:01.949
And of course, "roundabouts."

00:04:01.973 --> 00:04:03.149
Roundabouts --

00:04:03.173 --> 00:04:05.164
(Laughter)

00:04:05.188 --> 00:04:08.299
I can tell you honestly,
there is no rage like roundabout rage.

00:04:08.323 --> 00:04:10.712
(Laughter)

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:13.300
Sometimes their answers
aren't minor at all.

00:04:13.324 --> 00:04:16.832
Sometimes they talk
about racism and sexism and bullying

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:21.177
and environmental destruction --
big, global problems we all face.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.053
But sometimes,

00:04:23.077 --> 00:04:26.347
their answers are very specific,
maybe even oddly specific.

00:04:26.815 --> 00:04:28.950
"That wet line you get across your shirt

00:04:28.974 --> 00:04:32.322
when you accidentally lean
against the counter of a public bathroom."

00:04:32.346 --> 00:04:33.870
(Laughter)

00:04:33.894 --> 00:04:35.505
Super gross, right?

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:37.037
(Laughter)

00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:40.488
Or "Flash drives: there's only
two ways to plug them in,

00:04:40.512 --> 00:04:42.702
so why does it always
take me three tries?"

00:04:42.726 --> 00:04:47.209
(Laughter)

00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:50.938
Now whether it's minor or major,
whether it's general or specific,

00:04:50.962 --> 00:04:52.593
we can look at these examples

00:04:52.617 --> 00:04:55.248
and we can tease out some common themes.

00:04:55.272 --> 00:04:58.113
We get angry in situations
that are unpleasant,

00:04:58.137 --> 00:05:00.803
that feel unfair,
where our goals are blocked,

00:05:00.827 --> 00:05:03.941
that could have been avoided,
and that leave us feeling powerless.

00:05:03.965 --> 00:05:05.765
This is a recipe for anger.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.488
But you can also tell

00:05:07.512 --> 00:05:11.361
that anger is probably not the only thing
we're feeling in these situations.

00:05:11.385 --> 00:05:13.014
Anger doesn't happen in a vacuum.

00:05:13.038 --> 00:05:16.474
We can feel angry at the same time
that we're scared or sad,

00:05:16.498 --> 00:05:19.029
or feeling a host of other emotions.

00:05:19.053 --> 00:05:20.506
But here's the thing:

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.728
these provocations --
they aren't making us mad.

00:05:23.752 --> 00:05:25.062
At least not on their own,

00:05:25.086 --> 00:05:26.949
and we know that, because if they were,

00:05:26.973 --> 00:05:30.053
we'd all get angry
over the same things, and we don't.

00:05:30.077 --> 00:05:33.355
The reasons I get angry are different
than the reasons you get angry,

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:35.497
so there's got to be
something else going on.

00:05:35.521 --> 00:05:37.014
What is that something else?

00:05:37.038 --> 00:05:42.307
Well, we know what we're doing and feeling
at the moment of that provocation matters.

00:05:42.331 --> 00:05:46.061
We call this the pre-anger state --
are you hungry, are you tired,

00:05:46.085 --> 00:05:49.545
are you anxious about something else,
are you running late for something?

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:51.418
When you're feeling those things,

00:05:51.442 --> 00:05:53.870
those provocations feel that much worse.

00:05:54.752 --> 00:05:57.125
But what matters most
is not the provocation,

00:05:57.149 --> 00:05:59.720
it's not the pre-anger state, it's this:

00:05:59.744 --> 00:06:01.617
it's how we interpret that provocation,

00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:04.370
it's how we make sense of it in our lives.

00:06:04.394 --> 00:06:05.799
When something happens to us,

00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:08.903
we first decide, is this good or bad?

00:06:08.927 --> 00:06:12.601
Is it fair or unfair,
is it blameworthy, is it punishable?

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.808
That's primary appraisal,
it's when you evaluate the event itself.

00:06:16.832 --> 00:06:19.245
We decide what it means
in the context of our lives

00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:21.625
and once we've done that,
we decide how bad it is.

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:23.378
That's secondary appraisal.

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.464
We say, "Is this the worst thing
that's ever happened,

00:06:26.488 --> 00:06:28.088
or can I cope with this?

00:06:28.815 --> 00:06:32.322
Now, to illustrate that, I want you
to imagine you are driving somewhere.

00:06:33.052 --> 00:06:35.362
And before I go any further,
I should tell you,

00:06:35.386 --> 00:06:37.282
if I were an evil genius

00:06:37.306 --> 00:06:40.878
and I wanted to create a situation
that was going to make you mad,

00:06:40.902 --> 00:06:43.340
that situation would look
a lot like driving.

00:06:43.364 --> 00:06:44.359
(Laughter)

00:06:44.383 --> 00:06:45.541
It's true.

00:06:45.565 --> 00:06:47.732
You are, by definition,
on your way somewhere,

00:06:47.756 --> 00:06:52.333
so everything that happens -- traffic,
other drivers, road construction --

00:06:52.357 --> 00:06:54.505
it feels like it's blocking your goals.

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:57.720
There are all these written
and unwritten rules of the road,

00:06:57.744 --> 00:07:00.998
and those rules are routinely violated
right in front of you,

00:07:01.022 --> 00:07:02.537
usually without consequence.

00:07:02.561 --> 00:07:04.307
And who's violating those rules?

00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:06.926
Anonymous others,
people you will never see again,

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.085
making them a very easy target
for your wrath.

00:07:10.109 --> 00:07:11.887
(Laughter)

00:07:11.911 --> 00:07:15.607
So you're driving somewhere,
thus teed up to be angry,

00:07:15.631 --> 00:07:19.355
and the person in front of you
is driving well below the speed limit.

00:07:20.118 --> 00:07:21.341
And it's frustrating

00:07:21.365 --> 00:07:24.316
because you can't really see
why they're driving so slow.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.658
That's primary appraisal.

00:07:25.682 --> 00:07:28.942
You've looked at this and you've said
it's bad and it's blameworthy.

00:07:28.966 --> 00:07:31.567
But maybe you also decide
it's not that big a deal.

00:07:31.591 --> 00:07:33.884
You're not in a hurry, doesn't matter.

00:07:33.908 --> 00:07:36.360
That's secondary appraisal --
you don't get angry.

00:07:37.218 --> 00:07:41.074
But now imagine you're on your way
to a job interview.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.204
What that person is doing,
it hasn't changed, right?

00:07:44.228 --> 00:07:47.793
So primary appraisal doesn't change;
still bad, still blameworthy.

00:07:48.315 --> 00:07:51.156
But your ability
to cope with it sure does.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.569
Because all of a sudden,

00:07:52.593 --> 00:07:54.760
you're going to be late
to that job interview.

00:07:54.784 --> 00:07:55.935
All of a sudden,

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:57.869
you are not going to get your dream job,

00:07:57.893 --> 00:08:00.846
the one that was going to give you
piles and piles of money.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:01.871
(Laughter)

00:08:01.895 --> 00:08:04.228
Somebody else is going to get
your dream job

00:08:04.252 --> 00:08:05.902
and you're going to be broke.

00:08:05.926 --> 00:08:07.355
You're going to be destitute.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.633
Might as well stop now, turn around,
move in with your parents.

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:12.815
(Laughter)

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:14.003
Why?

00:08:14.027 --> 00:08:15.901
"Because of this person in front of me.

00:08:15.925 --> 00:08:17.918
This is not a person, this is a monster."

00:08:17.942 --> 00:08:18.942
(Laughter)

00:08:18.966 --> 00:08:22.480
And this monster is here
just to ruin your life.

00:08:22.504 --> 00:08:23.894
(Laughter)

00:08:23.918 --> 00:08:25.767
Now that thought process,

00:08:25.791 --> 00:08:30.497
it's called catastrophizing,
the one where we make the worst of things.

00:08:30.521 --> 00:08:33.252
And it's one of the primary
types of thoughts that we know

00:08:33.276 --> 00:08:34.941
is associated with chronic anger.

00:08:34.965 --> 00:08:37.037
But there's a couple of others.

00:08:37.061 --> 00:08:38.625
Misattributing causation.

00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:41.426
Angry people tend to put blame
where it doesn't belong.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.332
Not just on people,

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.244
but actually inanimate objects as well.

00:08:45.268 --> 00:08:47.157
And if you think that sound ridiculous,

00:08:47.181 --> 00:08:50.110
think about the last time
you lost your car keys and you said,

00:08:50.134 --> 00:08:51.585
"Where did those car keys go?"

00:08:51.609 --> 00:08:53.633
Because you know
they ran off on their own.

00:08:53.657 --> 00:08:56.567
(Laughter)

00:08:56.591 --> 00:08:59.456
They tend to overgeneralize,
they use words like "always,"

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.146
"never," "every,"
"this always happens to me,"

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:03.551
"I never get what I want"

00:09:03.575 --> 00:09:06.265
or "I hit every stoplight
on the way here today."

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:10.149
Demandingness: they put their own needs
ahead of the needs of others:

00:09:10.173 --> 00:09:12.474
"I don't care why this person
is driving so slow,

00:09:12.498 --> 00:09:16.401
they need to speed up or move over
so I can get to this job interview."

00:09:16.425 --> 00:09:18.716
And finally, inflammatory labeling.

00:09:19.275 --> 00:09:22.147
They call people fools, idiots, monsters,

00:09:22.171 --> 00:09:25.219
or a whole bunch of things
I've been told I'm not allowed to say

00:09:25.243 --> 00:09:26.410
during this TED Talk.

00:09:26.434 --> 00:09:27.855
(Laughter)

00:09:27.879 --> 00:09:29.149
So for a long time,

00:09:29.173 --> 00:09:32.629
psychologists have referred to these
as cognitive distortions

00:09:32.653 --> 00:09:34.207
or even irrational beliefs.

00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:36.690
And yeah, sometimes they are irrational.

00:09:37.462 --> 00:09:39.184
Maybe even most of the time.

00:09:39.208 --> 00:09:41.890
But sometimes, these thoughts
are totally rational.

00:09:42.649 --> 00:09:44.379
There is unfairness in the world.

00:09:44.403 --> 00:09:46.115
There are cruel, selfish people,

00:09:46.139 --> 00:09:49.997
and it's not only OK to be angry
when we're treated poorly,

00:09:50.021 --> 00:09:53.240
it's right to be angry
when we're treated poorly.

00:09:53.846 --> 00:09:57.847
If there's one thing I want you
to remember from my talk today, it's this:

00:09:57.871 --> 00:10:01.617
your anger exists in you as an emotion

00:10:01.641 --> 00:10:06.299
because it offered your ancestors,
both human and nonhuman,

00:10:06.323 --> 00:10:08.390
with an evolutionary advantage.

00:10:08.857 --> 00:10:11.942
Just as your fear alerts you to danger,

00:10:11.966 --> 00:10:14.122
your anger alerts you to injustice.

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:16.704
It's one of the ways your brain
communicates to you

00:10:16.728 --> 00:10:18.395
that you have had enough.

00:10:19.022 --> 00:10:22.416
What's more, it energizes you
to confront that injustice.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.646
Think for a second
about the last time you got mad.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.408
Your heart rate increased.

00:10:27.432 --> 00:10:29.733
Your breathing increased,
you started to sweat.

00:10:30.297 --> 00:10:32.161
That's your sympathetic nervous system,

00:10:32.185 --> 00:10:35.363
otherwise known
as your fight-or-flight system,

00:10:35.387 --> 00:10:38.974
kicking in to offer you
the energy you need to respond.

00:10:39.758 --> 00:10:41.584
And that's just the stuff you noticed.

00:10:41.608 --> 00:10:46.099
At the same time, your digestive system
slowed down so you could conserve energy.

00:10:46.123 --> 00:10:47.997
That's why your mouth went dry.

00:10:48.021 --> 00:10:52.065
And your blood vessels dilated
to get blood to your extremities.

00:10:52.089 --> 00:10:53.542
That's why your face went red.

00:10:53.566 --> 00:10:57.105
It's all part of this complex pattern
of physiological experiences

00:10:57.129 --> 00:10:58.367
that exist today

00:10:58.391 --> 00:11:01.149
because they helped your ancestors

00:11:01.173 --> 00:11:04.506
deal with cruel and unforgiving
forces of nature.

00:11:04.976 --> 00:11:08.207
And the problem is that the thing
your ancestors did

00:11:08.231 --> 00:11:09.504
to deal with their anger,

00:11:09.528 --> 00:11:10.856
to physically fight,

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.037
they are no longer reasonable
or appropriate.

00:11:13.061 --> 00:11:16.840
You can't and you shouldn't swing a club
every time you're provoked.

00:11:16.864 --> 00:11:19.704
(Laughter)

00:11:19.728 --> 00:11:21.466
But here's the good news.

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:22.914
You are capable of something

00:11:22.938 --> 00:11:25.395
your nonhuman ancestors
weren't capable of.

00:11:25.419 --> 00:11:28.777
And that is the capacity
to regulate your emotions.

00:11:29.174 --> 00:11:30.968
Even when you want to lash out,

00:11:30.992 --> 00:11:33.674
you can stop yourself
and you can channel that anger

00:11:33.698 --> 00:11:35.765
into something more productive.

00:11:36.119 --> 00:11:37.918
So often when we talk about anger,

00:11:37.942 --> 00:11:40.609
we talk about how to keep
from getting angry.

00:11:40.633 --> 00:11:43.164
We tell people to calm down or relax.

00:11:43.188 --> 00:11:45.466
We even tell people to let it go.

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:50.339
And all of that assumes that anger is bad
and that it's wrong to feel it.

00:11:50.712 --> 00:11:53.533
But instead, I like to think
of anger as a motivator.

00:11:53.557 --> 00:11:56.684
The same way your thirst
motivates you to get a drink of water,

00:11:56.708 --> 00:11:59.660
the same way your hunger
motivates you to get a bite to eat,

00:11:59.684 --> 00:12:03.183
your anger can motivate you
to respond to injustice.

00:12:03.609 --> 00:12:07.545
Because we don't have to think too hard
to find things we should be mad about.

00:12:08.085 --> 00:12:09.697
When we go back to the beginning,

00:12:09.721 --> 00:12:13.691
yeah, some of those things, they're silly
and not worth getting angry over.

00:12:13.715 --> 00:12:16.922
But racism, sexism, bullying,
environmental destruction,

00:12:16.946 --> 00:12:19.248
those things are real,
those things are terrible,

00:12:19.272 --> 00:12:22.498
and the only way to fix them
is to get mad first

00:12:22.522 --> 00:12:25.585
and then channel that anger
into fighting back.

00:12:26.053 --> 00:12:30.283
And you don't have to fight back
with aggression or hostility or violence.

00:12:30.307 --> 00:12:33.434
There are infinite ways
that you can express your anger.

00:12:33.458 --> 00:12:36.379
You can protest,
you can write letters to the editor,

00:12:36.403 --> 00:12:38.946
you can donate to
and volunteer for causes,

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.739
you can create art,
you can create literature,

00:12:41.763 --> 00:12:43.724
you can create poetry and music,

00:12:43.748 --> 00:12:46.247
you can create a community
that cares for one another

00:12:46.271 --> 00:12:48.484
and does not allow
those atrocities to happen.

00:12:49.331 --> 00:12:52.212
So the next time
you feel yourself getting angry,

00:12:52.236 --> 00:12:54.236
instead of trying to turn it off,

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:56.905
I hope you'll listen
to what that anger is telling you.

00:12:56.929 --> 00:13:00.460
And then I hope you'll channel it
into something positive and productive.

00:13:00.785 --> 00:13:01.936
Thank you.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.460
(Applause)
