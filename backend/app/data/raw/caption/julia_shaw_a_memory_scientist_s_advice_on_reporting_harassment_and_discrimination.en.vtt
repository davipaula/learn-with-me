00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.616
Me Too and Time's Up have highlighted

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.976
that harassment and discrimination
are a shockingly common part

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.056
of many people's lived reality,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.856
and that this reality
extends into the workplace.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.976
Whether in tech or finance,
sports or the service industry,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.736
every day we seem to hear another story
about an abuse of power

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.216
or another grossly inappropriate
workplace behavior.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.216
People are furious.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.600
They're taking to Twitter and social media
to voice that this must change.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.856
But it's time to move beyond the hashtag.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.376
It's time for us to report
harassment and discrimination

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.576
to those who can fix this mess.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.136
And it's time for us
to talk about harassment

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.096
in a more inclusive way:

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.216
not just about sexual harassment,

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.216
but to encourage people to come forward

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.856
about harassment and discrimination
based on other characteristics

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.560
such as age, disability or ethnicity.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.896
Because only together can we fix

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.960
the underlying causes
and consequences of harassment.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.376
You see, most of us will,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.736
at some point in our lives,

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.656
experience workplace
harassment or discrimination.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.096
Research shows that particularly
women, people of color

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.256
and people who openly identify as LGBTQI
are likely to be targeted,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.496
and for some people, this is a pervasive
and persistent part of their reality.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.376
And for most of these people --

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.016
98 percent according to some studies --

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.240
most of these people will never
speak up and tell their employer.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.136
Too often, harassment and discrimination
is a lonely and isolating experience,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.016
but we need to help people
out from under their desks.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.280
We need to empower people to have a voice.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.816
The reasonable first question
that everybody asks

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.856
once they've been harassed
is "What do I do now?"

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.840
And this is what I want to help you with.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.320
Navigating the barriers to reporting
can be absolutely dizzying.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.976
How can we speak up in a society

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.736
that too often discredits
or diminishes our experiences?

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.256
How can we speak up in a society

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.455
that is likely to be
retributive towards us?

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:25.880
How can we deal with the silencing
that goes on all around us?

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.176
Making matters worse,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.416
often our memories are the only
evidence we have of what happened.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.216
Now, here's where I can come in.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.616
I'm a memory scientist,

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.976
and I specialize in how we remember
important emotional events.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.896
I've particularly focused
on how the memory interview process

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.360
can severely impact the evidentiary
quality of reports that we produce.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.096
A bad interview can lead you
to forget details or misremember them

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.800
while a good interview can forever
change your life for the better.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.416
After looking at lab reports
and working,

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.536
studying this issue both in the courtroom
and in research settings,

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.016
I've dissected all the different things
that can go wrong with our memories

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.056
that can really threaten your case.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.576
And now I'm turning my attention
to helping people tackle

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.040
recording and reporting of workplace
harassment and discrimination.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.056
There's three things that I've learned
from my research on this

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.816
that you can immediately apply

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.016
if you've been harassed
or discriminated against at work.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.096
I want to help you
turn your memory into evidence --

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.296
evidence that even
a memory skeptic like me

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.160
is unlikely to find fault with.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.296
First of all, James Comey had it right.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.736
The former head of the FBI
used to sit in his car,

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.176
lock himself in after meetings
with the president

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.176
and write down absolutely everything
he could remember about what happened.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.016
The now-famous recordings
proved to be quite useful later on.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.816
Be like Comey.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.816
Now, you don't need to lock yourself
into your car to do this,

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.136
but please, immediately
after something happens,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.296
I want you to contemporaneously
record what happened.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.816
And do this before talking
to anyone else about it.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.776
Because as soon as your share your story

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.416
with friends or family
or colleagues or therapists,

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.056
you have the potential to distort
or change your memory of the event.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.160
Uncontaminated, contemporaneous
evidence is worth gold.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.096
Second: the type of evidence matters.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.736
Sure, you can do a handwritten
note of what happens,

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.640
but how do you prove when you wrote it?

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.736
Instead, pull out
your computer or smartphone

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.256
and make a note that's time-stamped,

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.960
where you can prove
this was recorded at this time.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.680
Contemporaneous,
time-stamped evidence is better.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.696
Finally, make sure what you're writing
down is actually relevant.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.656
Too often, we see that people
bring out Facebook messages,

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.896
they bring out time-stamped
pieces of evidence,

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.016
but sure, they're
not particularly relevant,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.856
they're not particularly useful.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.736
It's easy to write an emotional,
unstructured account of what happened --

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.296
understandable because
it's an emotional experience --

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.376
but those might not actually be
the details that matter later on

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.640
for an investigation.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.096
Write down this list.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.160
I want you to keep track of this
and simply fill in the blanks.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.376
First of all, what happened?

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.976
In as much detail as possible,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.656
describe the situation,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.336
and do it on the day it happened
if at all possible.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.856
Second, who was there?

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.216
Were there any witnesses?

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.816
This becomes crucial potentially later on.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.416
What exact time and date did this happen?

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.496
What location? Where did this happen?

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.856
Who did you tell after the event?

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.816
How did it make you feel
during and after it happened?

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.616
And is there any other evidence
such as WhatsApps, photos or emails

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.280
that might lend
more credibility to your case.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.136
These are all details that are incredibly
easy to record contemporaneously

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.896
but are also incredibly easy
to forget later on.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.896
Humans, according to research,
often overestimate their ability

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.696
to remember important
emotional details later on.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.936
Assume that you're going to forget.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.160
Assume you have to write it down.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.416
Now, these three pieces of advice
are a good start,

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.816
but of course they don't overcome
a lot of the other barriers to reporting.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.736
According to the Equality
and Human Rights Commission,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.016
which published a report in 2018,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.776
there's one key recommendation
to overcome some of the other fears

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.760
often associated with reporting
these kinds of incidents to your employer.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.240
One piece of advice that they made?

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.016
Have an online, anonymous reporting tool.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.656
Only that way, they say,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.960
can you truly overcome many
of the fears associated with reporting.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.056
Now, in line with this,

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.496
and informed by what
was happening all around me

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.496
and taking and applying
the memory science,

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.136
the science that I had
been doing for many years,

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.216
I sat down with a number of people

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.280
and we together created TalkToSpot.com.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.016
Spot is an online,
anonymous reporting tool

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.776
that helps you record and report
workplace harassment and discrimination.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.496
It allows you to do it anonymously,

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.176
it allows you to do it for free,

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.096
and it's completely evidence-based.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.816
You don't have to talk to a person,

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.296
there's no fear of judgment,

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.000
and you can do it
whenever and wherever you need.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.240
Now you have the power to walk through
an evidence-based memory interview.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.856
Now, this is called a cognitive interview.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.096
This is the same technique that police use
when they're doing their job properly.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.216
So in best-case scenarios,

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.056
people who are being asked
about important emotional events

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.256
are being asked in line
with the cognitive interview.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.136
Now, this walks you through
all the relevant information

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.976
so that at the end,
after you've talked to the bot --

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.496
which is an automatic messaging system --

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.016
after you've talked to the bot,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.336
it generates a PDF record
that's time-stamped and securely signed

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.416
that you can keep for yourself as evidence
in case you want to share it later,

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.960
or you can submit it
to your employer right away.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.536
And in line with recommendations,

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.080
you can submit it
to your employer anonymously.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.736
But a reporting tool is only as useful
as the audience that's listening.

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.616
So if your employer
is truly committed to change,

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.376
we've decided to also offer them
the tool to respond.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.336
So if organizations work with us

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.416
and are truly committed to doing something

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.616
about workplace harassment
and discrimination,

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.536
they're also able to respond to you
even if you've chosen to stay anonymous.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.816
We think it's important that you can work
together with your employer

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.560
to tackle this issue.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.336
We think that everybody wins
when we bring light into this dark issue.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.015
Whether it happens to you
or to someone you know,

00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:47.936
recording and reporting what happened

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.056
can really improve
how we talk about these issues.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.535
And if you're an organization,

00:08:53.559 --> 00:08:56.296
this is a call to give
your employees access

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.176
to better and more effective
reporting mechanisms.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.336
We know that the current methods
that are used in most organizations

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.720
don't work effectively.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.280
It's time to change that if you're
committed to inclusion and diversity.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:16.200
It's time for us
to celebrate our diversity.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.136
It's time for us to give a voice

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.000
to those who have for too long
been denied one.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.856
It's time for us to celebrate
those who come forward,

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.136
even if they feel
they need to stay anonymous --

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.136
to stay masked to do so.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.720
It's time for a reporting revolution.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.936
Thank you.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.200
(Applause)
