00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.404
All of the resources
that we have ever used as a civilization

00:00:17.404 --> 00:00:19.468
have come from the same place.

00:00:20.663 --> 00:00:22.003
Everything.

00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:24.829
All the energy, the fuels,

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.115
minerals, metals, construction materials.

00:00:28.715 --> 00:00:31.949
The water, the air
that you're breathing right now.

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:36.832
Every resource that we've ever used
has come from the same place:

00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:38.603
Earth.

00:00:39.597 --> 00:00:42.193
Now, this actually presents
a severe problem,

00:00:42.504 --> 00:00:44.477
because when we study biological history,

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:47.697
we very quickly see that any time
there's a dominant species

00:00:48.737 --> 00:00:50.743
in a finite ecosystem,

00:00:51.026 --> 00:00:53.652
consuming a limited amount of resources,

00:00:53.652 --> 00:00:55.599
that species will collapse.

00:00:56.852 --> 00:00:59.604
Now, that collapse usually begins at 50%.

00:00:59.604 --> 00:01:03.124
When a species has converted
50% of its environment,

00:01:03.124 --> 00:01:06.084
the ecosystem becomes
unstable, and it changes.

00:01:06.084 --> 00:01:09.264
It’s no longer suitable
for that particular species.

00:01:10.264 --> 00:01:11.844
Now, here’s the scary part.

00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:15.115
There are 7 billion people on this planet.

00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:17.293
We are the dominant species.

00:01:17.523 --> 00:01:22.366
And we’ve converted 43%
of the available land mass on Earth.

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:27.789
By the year 2050, there will be
9 billion people on our planet

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.929
and we will be well past 50%.

00:01:32.014 --> 00:01:35.665
That means most of the people sitting
in this auditorium will see this begin.

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.334
We don’t know exactly 
what it's going to look like,

00:01:38.334 --> 00:01:40.830
we don't know exactly
what the impact is going to be,

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.602
but the worst case scenario
is the end of the human race.

00:01:44.236 --> 00:01:47.942
Because Earth is no longer
suitable for human life.

00:01:47.942 --> 00:01:51.335
Now, the reason that this problem exists
is because it’s in our nature.

00:01:51.865 --> 00:01:53.604
Human beings consume resources.

00:01:53.604 --> 00:01:56.593
They alter their environment
so they can reproduce.

00:01:56.593 --> 00:01:59.161
It’s the very definition
of biological life.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.913
The problem is we’re running out of room,
we're running out of resources

00:02:02.913 --> 00:02:04.633
and now we're running out of time.

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:06.152
So we need a plan.

00:02:07.334 --> 00:02:08.586
What if -

00:02:09.174 --> 00:02:13.331
what if there was a way 
that we could make our ecosystem bigger?

00:02:14.844 --> 00:02:18.043
If we expand our view 
and we look out into space,

00:02:18.043 --> 00:02:21.353
we see that all the resources
we hold of value here at home -

00:02:21.353 --> 00:02:23.634
energy, fuels, metals, water -

00:02:23.634 --> 00:02:26.429
are available in nearly
infinite quantities

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:28.106
in our solar system.

00:02:29.074 --> 00:02:31.874
What if there’s a way 
we could use those resources

00:02:31.874 --> 00:02:34.567
to prevent the collapse
of our civilization?

00:02:36.194 --> 00:02:38.234
Now, I know, that sounds impossible.

00:02:38.234 --> 00:02:40.113
It sounds like science fiction.

00:02:40.483 --> 00:02:42.654
But I have a different
viewpoint than you do.

00:02:43.084 --> 00:02:45.601
I work with some of the smartest
people in the world:

00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:48.825
engineers who have consistently
landed robots on other planets;

00:02:49.192 --> 00:02:52.140
a lot of scientists,
rocket scientists, data scientists,

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.140
planetary scientists,
artificial intelligence experts.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.493
I’m the head of strategic partnerships

00:02:57.493 --> 00:03:00.783
for the largest asteroid-mining
company in the world.

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:06.304
And I believe we can use the resources
of space to save our planet.

00:03:07.753 --> 00:03:09.194
We have proven again and again

00:03:09.194 --> 00:03:11.942
that we know how
to destroy an environment.

00:03:13.474 --> 00:03:16.345
Now it’s time for us to prove
that we can save it.

00:03:17.427 --> 00:03:18.505
From my vantage point,

00:03:18.505 --> 00:03:21.625
I see that there's more
computing power in your car’s key fob

00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:24.245
than we use to send
the astronauts to the Moon.

00:03:25.055 --> 00:03:29.586
That means we can do incredible things
in space with cheap, affordable robots.

00:03:30.822 --> 00:03:34.914
For the very first time in history
we’ve amassed the technological toolkit

00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:38.384
that we need to dispatch 
autonomous robotic explorers

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:40.484
out into the solar system

00:03:40.484 --> 00:03:43.894
to find and access these resources
and put them to work.

00:03:45.854 --> 00:03:51.807
Imagine a future where the resources
we need do not only come from this planet,

00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:58.066
a future where we have access
to the vast resources of space

00:03:58.066 --> 00:04:01.596
and we are using them
to improve life here on Earth.

00:04:02.386 --> 00:04:04.507
That’s the future 
I’m going to show you.

00:04:05.227 --> 00:04:06.927
It all starts with water.

00:04:06.927 --> 00:04:10.203
See, today if you want water in space
you have to take that resource,

00:04:10.203 --> 00:04:13.283
you have to load it onto a rocket
and launch it into space.

00:04:13.283 --> 00:04:16.462
Now, that’s a shame because there’s
a lot of water in space.

00:04:16.462 --> 00:04:18.493
There’s water on asteroids, on comets,

00:04:18.493 --> 00:04:20.733
on the poles of our Moon,
and on other planets.

00:04:20.733 --> 00:04:22.762
Water is everywhere in space.

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.358
And that’s a good thing

00:04:25.036 --> 00:04:28.633
because water is one of the most
critical resources we will need.

00:04:28.633 --> 00:04:30.942
You see, this plan
involves a lot of robots,

00:04:30.942 --> 00:04:32.713
but it also involves a lot of people.

00:04:32.713 --> 00:04:36.032
People will be living and working
in space to make this possible.

00:04:36.032 --> 00:04:37.763
And those people need water

00:04:37.763 --> 00:04:40.803
for sustenance,
for hygiene, for growing food.

00:04:41.453 --> 00:04:43.985
But water in space is also fuel.

00:04:44.387 --> 00:04:46.488
If we pass water
through an electrical field,

00:04:46.488 --> 00:04:49.118
we can produce liquid hydrogen
and liquid oxygen.

00:04:49.118 --> 00:04:52.026
That’s high-efficiency rocket propellant.

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:56.256
So if the source water from space
and turn it into rocket propellant,

00:04:56.256 --> 00:04:58.906
we can set up fuel depots
in the solar system,

00:04:58.906 --> 00:05:00.403
gas stations!

00:05:01.076 --> 00:05:05.177
And when we do that, for the first time
we have access to this new resource base

00:05:05.177 --> 00:05:08.187
because we’re not trying to launch
all our fuel from Earth.

00:05:08.544 --> 00:05:11.790
And now that we have access,
we can turn our sights to the next step:

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.462
construction.

00:05:14.216 --> 00:05:17.524
You see, asteroids are also made
of pure, high-quality metals:

00:05:17.924 --> 00:05:20.834
nickel, iron, cobalt, platinum.

00:05:21.194 --> 00:05:24.817
This is the first object
that was created from an asteroid.

00:05:24.817 --> 00:05:27.507
It was the 3D-printed from a meteorite.

00:05:27.507 --> 00:05:29.486
It’s very heavy, it’s very strong,

00:05:29.486 --> 00:05:33.256
you’d never want to launch 
something like this into space from Earth.

00:05:33.496 --> 00:05:35.824
But if you source metals from space

00:05:35.824 --> 00:05:38.834
and feed them to orbital
construction robots -

00:05:38.834 --> 00:05:42.184
which by the way, that's already
a thing, we already have that -

00:05:42.544 --> 00:05:46.174
then you can create structures
that are no longer limited by size.

00:05:46.684 --> 00:05:48.786
See, this is the
International Space Station.

00:05:48.786 --> 00:05:51.376
It is the most expensive object
humans have ever built.

00:05:51.376 --> 00:05:53.594
It cost a hundred billion dollars.

00:05:53.946 --> 00:05:55.924
Why was it so expensive?

00:05:55.924 --> 00:05:59.307
Well, it was created 
using the resources of Earth,

00:05:59.307 --> 00:06:01.766
that were turned into products,
loaded onto rockets,

00:06:01.766 --> 00:06:04.596
launched into space
and then assembled by humans.

00:06:05.066 --> 00:06:06.725
But that’s backwards.

00:06:07.096 --> 00:06:08.916
It doesn’t make sense anymore.

00:06:08.916 --> 00:06:12.276
That’s like roughly the equivalent
of you living in Europe and saying,

00:06:12.276 --> 00:06:15.306
"I’m going to move to the United States
and build a house there,

00:06:15.306 --> 00:06:18.946
but I’m going to ship all the materials
to build that house across the ocean;

00:06:19.467 --> 00:06:23.119
all of the wood, the metal, the plumbing,
the electrical, the shower heads,

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:25.348
I'm going to ship it across the ocean,''

00:06:25.807 --> 00:06:30.317
when all of the resources you need
are already there at your destination.

00:06:30.317 --> 00:06:31.813
It doesn't make sense.

00:06:32.307 --> 00:06:35.099
We can reduce the cost
and logistical inefficiencies

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:39.522
of building large livable structures 
in space by a factor of a hundred

00:06:39.522 --> 00:06:42.582
by simply sourcing what we need
from our destination.

00:06:43.526 --> 00:06:45.645
So we can build things in space!

00:06:46.524 --> 00:06:48.119
What should we build?

00:06:49.118 --> 00:06:50.368
Well,

00:06:51.197 --> 00:06:55.352
energy is the single largest driver
of resource consumption in the world.

00:06:56.057 --> 00:06:57.374
We mine for coal.

00:06:57.704 --> 00:06:59.921
We drill for oil and natural gas.

00:06:59.921 --> 00:07:02.351
We mine for metals 
to build our wind plants.

00:07:02.351 --> 00:07:04.515
We mine for silicon 
to make our solar panels.

00:07:04.515 --> 00:07:07.205
We mine for nickel to make batteries 
so we can store it.

00:07:07.205 --> 00:07:08.533
One thing remains the same.

00:07:08.533 --> 00:07:10.973
As the population grows, 
so does the energy demand,

00:07:10.973 --> 00:07:13.528
so does the resource consumption
that goes with it.

00:07:14.627 --> 00:07:15.737
We've always assumed

00:07:15.737 --> 00:07:19.287
that our energy production 
must happen here on Earth

00:07:19.287 --> 00:07:21.843
because there's never been an alternative,

00:07:21.843 --> 00:07:23.473
because we haven't built one.

00:07:24.634 --> 00:07:26.694
If we use the resources of space,

00:07:26.694 --> 00:07:31.194
we can create massive, 
kilometer-scale solar farms in space.

00:07:31.738 --> 00:07:34.408
These huge facilities
will capture the energy of the sun,

00:07:34.408 --> 00:07:37.166
that shines in space 24 hours a day,

00:07:37.166 --> 00:07:39.106
and beam that energy back to Earth.

00:07:39.106 --> 00:07:41.616
The technology to do this exists today,

00:07:41.616 --> 00:07:45.756
but it's simply too expensive 
when we try to use the resources of Earth.

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:48.816
But if we use the resources in space,

00:07:49.694 --> 00:07:52.384
we can create planetary-scale macrogrids.

00:07:52.707 --> 00:07:56.297
You've heard of the electricity grid,
maybe you've heard of the microgrid.

00:07:56.297 --> 00:07:57.747
This is the opposite.

00:07:57.747 --> 00:08:00.607
This is a planetary-scale, 
power-generation system.

00:08:01.159 --> 00:08:04.310
It's the energy that we need 
and the energy is in space.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.999
It's not the resources 
buried under our feet.

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:11.634
So we have water, fuel, 
construction capabilities, now power,

00:08:11.634 --> 00:08:15.584
we have all of the utilities 
we need to build cities in space.

00:08:16.695 --> 00:08:19.793
Orbital megastructures 
spun up to produce artificial gravity

00:08:19.793 --> 00:08:22.183
so they're livable for large populations.

00:08:22.613 --> 00:08:25.817
These are emerging today 
as commercial space stations.

00:08:25.817 --> 00:08:28.043
They're research labs 
for sovereign astronauts

00:08:28.043 --> 00:08:29.483
from around the world;

00:08:29.483 --> 00:08:31.474
hotels for adventurous tourists,

00:08:31.474 --> 00:08:32.944
certainly.

00:08:33.784 --> 00:08:37.035
But the primary function of these
facilities will be manufacturing.

00:08:37.319 --> 00:08:39.306
We will build things in space.

00:08:39.744 --> 00:08:42.179
It starts with satellites and spacecraft.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:44.466
Why would we want 
to build satellites in space?

00:08:44.466 --> 00:08:46.026
Today when we build a satellite,

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:48.766
it's constrained by the rocket 
that takes it to space.

00:08:48.766 --> 00:08:52.200
It has to be built and designed 
to fit on top of that rocket.

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:56.252
And it has to be designed to survive
the violent rocket launch

00:08:56.252 --> 00:08:57.542
to the atmosphere.

00:08:57.542 --> 00:08:58.862
(Mimicking a rocket)

00:08:58.862 --> 00:09:00.022
(Laughter)

00:09:00.022 --> 00:09:02.400
But if we remove that constraint,

00:09:03.055 --> 00:09:06.625
we can build things that are
as big as our imagination

00:09:06.625 --> 00:09:08.326
and vastly more capable.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.640
And if we've come this far,
we can take the final step

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.457
and we can start to solve
our resource crisis.

00:09:16.568 --> 00:09:20.286
We can move our industrial
manufacturing into space,

00:09:21.016 --> 00:09:22.406
all of it.

00:09:22.406 --> 00:09:25.426
You see, manufacturing 
is resource consumption.

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:29.537
We use the resources of Earth,
we turn them into manufactured products,

00:09:29.537 --> 00:09:31.918
so we can sell them and do useful things.

00:09:31.918 --> 00:09:34.274
That is what drives commerce on Earth.

00:09:34.619 --> 00:09:36.789
But what if we reverse that?

00:09:37.417 --> 00:09:40.785
What if we gather and harvest 
all of our raw materials and resources

00:09:40.785 --> 00:09:42.395
from deep space

00:09:42.395 --> 00:09:43.905
and import them

00:09:43.905 --> 00:09:47.449
to an orbital manufacturing ring
around the planet,

00:09:47.449 --> 00:09:51.245
and then return only
the finished products to the surface?

00:09:52.508 --> 00:09:54.998
Let's use your smartphone as an example.

00:09:55.968 --> 00:09:58.958
This was created 
using raw materials from Earth.

00:09:58.958 --> 00:10:01.362
Yet, every single one 
of the raw materials in this

00:10:01.362 --> 00:10:03.933
exists in infinite quantities in space.

00:10:04.669 --> 00:10:07.302
The most expensive component
of your phone is platinum,

00:10:07.302 --> 00:10:10.049
and platinum is readily available 
in near-earth asteroids

00:10:10.049 --> 00:10:11.818
passing by us all the time.

00:10:11.818 --> 00:10:14.637
This is created here on Earth
using the resources of Earth,

00:10:14.637 --> 00:10:18.499
in a factory that produces emissions,
consumes resources.

00:10:18.499 --> 00:10:22.080
They use toxic chemicals 
like benzene to produce this.

00:10:23.188 --> 00:10:28.248
And that factory produces hazardous waste
that's the byproduct of manufacturing.

00:10:28.248 --> 00:10:32.978
That's the bad stuff:
poisons, toxins, heavy metals, radiation.

00:10:34.022 --> 00:10:38.132
The problem is all of the hazardous waste 
from manufacturing is stuck with us here

00:10:38.132 --> 00:10:40.472
in the finite ecosystem that we live in.

00:10:41.451 --> 00:10:43.971
It's poisoning our air, our water,

00:10:44.638 --> 00:10:47.979
our fish, our wildlife, our food our kids!

00:10:49.488 --> 00:10:51.887
Do you know where this should not be made?

00:10:52.503 --> 00:10:53.953
(Laughter)

00:10:53.953 --> 00:10:55.245
(Breathing in)

00:10:55.944 --> 00:10:57.349
(Breathing out)

00:10:57.349 --> 00:10:58.719
(Laughter)

00:10:58.719 --> 00:11:03.117
In the only breathable atmosphere 
that we know of anywhere,

00:11:03.937 --> 00:11:07.093
a resource that we take for granted
every minute of every day.

00:11:09.119 --> 00:11:10.437
So if we do this,

00:11:10.437 --> 00:11:12.964
we reverse the human supply chain,

00:11:13.797 --> 00:11:16.280
we push all of our mining 
and manufacturing

00:11:17.378 --> 00:11:18.906
outside the atmosphere,

00:11:19.206 --> 00:11:20.712
what have we done?

00:11:21.591 --> 00:11:24.884
We've now zoned the Earth
for residential access only.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:30.151
Imagine if you walked outside one day 
and there were no factories,

00:11:30.157 --> 00:11:35.463
no power plants, no refineries, 
no oil rigs, no pipelines to protest,

00:11:35.947 --> 00:11:39.911
and instead we simply allowed the planet 
to return to a more natural state,

00:11:40.465 --> 00:11:43.465
we intentionally stabilized
our environment.

00:11:44.926 --> 00:11:48.833
We'd have more space here on Earth, 
more room for the population,

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:53.109
because we're not trying to live
on top of our consumable resource base.

00:11:54.204 --> 00:11:57.283
And to be clear, this is not
a vision about scarcity.

00:11:57.283 --> 00:11:58.957
And yes, we still have to conserve

00:11:58.957 --> 00:12:01.767
all of the precious resources
we have here at home.

00:12:01.767 --> 00:12:04.038
But this is a vision about abundance.

00:12:04.038 --> 00:12:06.717
It's about having access
to all of the resources we need

00:12:06.717 --> 00:12:08.737
to grow as a civilization.

00:12:08.737 --> 00:12:11.087
They're simply coming
from a different place.

00:12:11.087 --> 00:12:13.709
Now, I know, I know
this sounds impossible,

00:12:14.334 --> 00:12:17.639
but it's happening fast,
faster than you could ever imagine,

00:12:17.639 --> 00:12:19.026
and it's already started.

00:12:19.647 --> 00:12:21.178
My kids are two.

00:12:21.513 --> 00:12:25.163
By the time they're in high school,
they will see operational asteroid mines.

00:12:25.638 --> 00:12:26.888
They'll grow up in a world

00:12:26.888 --> 00:12:31.438
knowing that the resources we need
do not simply come from only this planet.

00:12:32.058 --> 00:12:33.987
As a parent this gives me a lot of hope,

00:12:33.987 --> 00:12:36.227
because I want to create
a world for those kids

00:12:36.227 --> 00:12:39.582
that gets better and better,
not worse and worse.

00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:42.845
And when someone asks them,

00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:45.125
"Why we should be exploring space

00:12:45.125 --> 00:12:47.745
when we have so many
problems here at home?",

00:12:47.745 --> 00:12:49.534
they will know the answer to that.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:54.331
The resources of space are the solutions
to our greatest problems.

00:12:54.968 --> 00:12:59.465
It is only by exploring space
that we safeguard this world,

00:13:00.828 --> 00:13:02.854
the one that matters the most.

00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:06.570
This is what I ask of you:

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.330
believe that this is possible,

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:12.220
because for the very first time
in human history, it is possible.

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.709
When we access the infinite
resources of space,

00:13:15.709 --> 00:13:19.807
we do so so we can protect and preserve
the single most important asset

00:13:19.807 --> 00:13:22.447
that we know of anywhere in the universe,

00:13:24.202 --> 00:13:27.465
the only place that we know of
that can support human life:

00:13:27.966 --> 00:13:29.247
our home,

00:13:30.459 --> 00:13:31.633
Earth.

00:13:32.295 --> 00:13:33.598
Thank you.

00:13:33.598 --> 00:13:35.620
(Applause)
