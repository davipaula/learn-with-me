00:00:12.896 --> 00:00:16.642
We know more about
other planets than our own,

00:00:17.446 --> 00:00:20.670
and today, I want to show you
a new type of robot

00:00:20.693 --> 00:00:24.733
designed to help us
better understand our own planet.

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:27.020
It belongs to a category

00:00:27.044 --> 00:00:31.998
known in the oceanographic community
as an unmanned surface vehicle, or USV.

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:34.595
And it uses no fuel.

00:00:35.047 --> 00:00:38.981
Instead, it relies
on wind power for propulsion.

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:42.760
And yet, it can sail around the globe
for months at a time.

00:00:43.474 --> 00:00:46.352
So I want to share with you
why we built it,

00:00:46.376 --> 00:00:47.868
and what it means for you.

00:00:49.814 --> 00:00:54.398
A few years ago, I was on a sailboat
making its way across the Pacific,

00:00:54.422 --> 00:00:56.620
from San Francisco to Hawaii.

00:00:57.296 --> 00:01:00.650
I had just spent the past 10 years
working nonstop,

00:01:00.674 --> 00:01:03.790
developing video games
for hundreds of millions of users,

00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:07.335
and I wanted to take a step back
and look at the big picture

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:09.296
and get some much-needed thinking time.

00:01:09.918 --> 00:01:11.463
I was the navigator on board,

00:01:12.034 --> 00:01:15.698
and one evening, after a long session
analyzing weather data

00:01:15.722 --> 00:01:17.351
and plotting our course,

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:20.449
I came up on deck and saw
this beautiful sunset.

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:22.247
And a thought occurred to me:

00:01:22.747 --> 00:01:26.101
How much do we really know
about our oceans?

00:01:27.252 --> 00:01:31.131
The Pacific was stretching all around me
as far as the eye could see,

00:01:31.155 --> 00:01:33.470
and the waves were
rocking our boat forcefully,

00:01:33.494 --> 00:01:36.700
a sort of constant reminder
of its untold power.

00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:40.523
How much do we really know
about our oceans?

00:01:41.235 --> 00:01:42.773
I decided to find out.

00:01:44.362 --> 00:01:47.471
What I quickly learned
is that we don't know very much.

00:01:47.495 --> 00:01:50.621
The first reason is just
how vast oceans are,

00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:52.986
covering 70 percent of the planet,

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.555
and yet we know they drive
complex planetary systems

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.759
like global weather,

00:01:57.783 --> 00:02:00.228
which affect all of us on a daily basis,

00:02:00.252 --> 00:02:01.870
sometimes dramatically.

00:02:02.562 --> 00:02:05.746
And yet, those activities
are mostly invisible to us.

00:02:06.944 --> 00:02:10.709
Ocean data is scarce by any standard.

00:02:11.268 --> 00:02:16.372
Back on land, I had grown used to
accessing lots of sensors --

00:02:16.396 --> 00:02:18.024
billions of them, actually.

00:02:18.576 --> 00:02:25.030
But at sea, in situ data
is scarce and expensive.

00:02:25.535 --> 00:02:29.530
Why? Because it relies on
a small number of ships and buoys.

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:32.790
How small a number
was actually a great surprise.

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.450
Our National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration,

00:02:36.474 --> 00:02:38.097
better known as NOAA,

00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:40.450
only has 16 ships,

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:45.223
and there are less than
200 buoys offshore globally.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.441
It is easy to understand why:

00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:49.605
the oceans are an unforgiving place,

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.963
and to collect in situ data,
you need a big ship,

00:02:52.987 --> 00:02:55.321
capable of carrying a vast amount of fuel

00:02:55.345 --> 00:02:57.163
and large crews,

00:02:57.187 --> 00:03:00.366
costing hundreds
of millions of dollars each,

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.712
or, big buoys tethered to the ocean floor
with a four-mile-long cable

00:03:06.513 --> 00:03:09.508
and weighted down
by a set of train wheels,

00:03:09.532 --> 00:03:14.141
which is both dangerous to deploy
and expensive to maintain.

00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:16.554
What about satellites, you might ask?

00:03:17.028 --> 00:03:18.931
Well, satellites are fantastic,

00:03:18.955 --> 00:03:21.458
and they have taught us
so much about the big picture

00:03:21.482 --> 00:03:23.503
over the past few decades.

00:03:23.527 --> 00:03:25.903
However, the problem with satellites

00:03:25.927 --> 00:03:30.207
is they can only see through one micron
of the surface of the ocean.

00:03:31.124 --> 00:03:34.697
They have relatively poor
spatial and temporal resolution,

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.724
and their signal needs to be corrected
for cloud cover and land effects

00:03:39.748 --> 00:03:40.956
and other factors.

00:03:42.094 --> 00:03:45.365
So what is going on in the oceans?

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:47.561
And what are we trying to measure?

00:03:48.283 --> 00:03:50.869
And how could a robot be of any use?

00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:55.259
Let's zoom in on
a small cube in the ocean.

00:03:55.283 --> 00:03:58.591
One of the key things we want
to understand is the surface,

00:03:58.615 --> 00:04:00.654
because the surface,
if you think about it,

00:04:00.678 --> 00:04:03.977
is the nexus of all air-sea interaction.

00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:08.995
It is the interface through which
all energy and gases must flow.

00:04:09.552 --> 00:04:11.652
Our sun radiates energy,

00:04:11.676 --> 00:04:14.572
which is absorbed by oceans as heat

00:04:14.596 --> 00:04:17.452
and then partially released
into the atmosphere.

00:04:17.476 --> 00:04:21.644
Gases in our atmosphere like CO2
get dissolved into our oceans.

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:25.728
Actually, about 30 percent
of all global CO2 gets absorbed.

00:04:26.603 --> 00:04:30.211
Plankton and microorganisms
release oxygen into the atmosphere,

00:04:30.235 --> 00:04:34.406
so much so that every other breath
you take comes from the ocean.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.462
Some of that heat generates evaporation,
which creates clouds

00:04:37.486 --> 00:04:39.780
and then eventually
leads to precipitation.

00:04:39.804 --> 00:04:42.057
And pressure gradients
create surface wind,

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:44.878
which moves the moisture
through the atmosphere.

00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:49.564
Some of the heat radiates down
into the deep ocean

00:04:49.588 --> 00:04:51.716
and gets stored in different layers,

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.045
the ocean acting as some kind
of planetary-scale boiler

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:56.690
to store all that energy,

00:04:56.714 --> 00:05:00.451
which later might be released
in short-term events like hurricanes

00:05:00.475 --> 00:05:02.856
or long-term phenomena like El NiÃ±o.

00:05:03.329 --> 00:05:07.644
These layers can get mixed up
by vertical upwelling currents

00:05:07.668 --> 00:05:11.114
or horizontal currents,
which are key in transporting heat

00:05:11.138 --> 00:05:13.112
from the tropics to the poles.

00:05:13.623 --> 00:05:16.422
And of course, there is marine life,

00:05:16.446 --> 00:05:21.462
occupying the largest ecosystem
in volume on the planet,

00:05:21.486 --> 00:05:25.188
from microorganisms to fish
to marine mammals,

00:05:25.212 --> 00:05:28.220
like seals, dolphins and whales.

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:31.821
But all of these
are mostly invisible to us.

00:05:33.821 --> 00:05:39.197
The challenge in studying
those ocean variables at scale

00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:41.395
is one of energy,

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:45.542
the energy that it takes to deploy
sensors into the deep ocean.

00:05:46.597 --> 00:05:48.890
And of course, many solutions
have been tried --

00:05:48.914 --> 00:05:50.525
from wave-actuated devices

00:05:50.549 --> 00:05:52.090
to surface drifters

00:05:52.114 --> 00:05:54.836
to sun-powered electrical drives --

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.972
each with their own compromises.

00:05:57.745 --> 00:06:00.915
Our team breakthrough came
from an unlikely source --

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:05.288
the pursuit of the world speed record
in a wind-powered land yacht.

00:06:05.742 --> 00:06:08.043
It took 10 years of research
and development

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:10.596
to come up with a novel wing concept

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.428
that only uses three watts
of power to control

00:06:14.452 --> 00:06:17.540
and yet can propel a vehicle
all around the globe

00:06:17.564 --> 00:06:19.764
with seemingly unlimited autonomy.

00:06:20.262 --> 00:06:23.608
By adapting this wing concept
into a marine vehicle,

00:06:24.356 --> 00:06:26.662
we had the genesis of an ocean drone.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.614
Now, these are larger than they appear.

00:06:29.638 --> 00:06:34.214
They are about 15 feet high,
23 feet long, seven feet deep.

00:06:34.238 --> 00:06:36.291
Think of them as surface satellites.

00:06:36.315 --> 00:06:39.453
They're laden with an array
of science-grade sensors

00:06:39.477 --> 00:06:41.285
that measure all key variables,

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:44.307
both oceanographic and atmospheric,

00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:48.688
and a live satellite link transmits
this high-resolution data

00:06:48.712 --> 00:06:50.754
back to shore in real time.

00:06:51.515 --> 00:06:54.393
Our team has been hard at work
over the past few years,

00:06:54.417 --> 00:06:57.925
conducting missions in some of
the toughest ocean conditions

00:06:57.949 --> 00:06:59.173
on the planet,

00:06:59.197 --> 00:07:01.662
from the Arctic to the tropical Pacific.

00:07:01.686 --> 00:07:04.410
We have sailed all the way
to the polar ice shelf.

00:07:04.434 --> 00:07:06.773
We have sailed into Atlantic hurricanes.

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:09.117
We have rounded Cape Horn,

00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:12.380
and we have slalomed between
the oil rigs of the Gulf of Mexico.

00:07:12.404 --> 00:07:14.734
This is one tough robot.

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:18.610
Let me share with you
recent work that we did

00:07:18.634 --> 00:07:20.508
around the Pribilof Islands.

00:07:20.532 --> 00:07:24.451
This is a small group of islands
deep in the cold Bering Sea

00:07:24.475 --> 00:07:26.637
between the US and Russia.

00:07:26.661 --> 00:07:30.111
Now, the Bering Sea is the home
of the walleye pollock,

00:07:30.135 --> 00:07:32.710
which is a whitefish
you might not recognize,

00:07:32.734 --> 00:07:37.421
but you might likely have tasted
if you enjoy fish sticks or surimi.

00:07:37.445 --> 00:07:41.067
Yes, surimi looks like crabmeat,
but it's actually pollock.

00:07:41.908 --> 00:07:44.918
And the pollock fishery
is the largest fishery in the nation,

00:07:44.942 --> 00:07:47.487
both in terms of value and volume --

00:07:47.511 --> 00:07:50.980
about 3.1 billion pounds
of fish caught every year.

00:07:51.695 --> 00:07:54.394
So over the past few years,
a fleet of ocean drones

00:07:54.418 --> 00:07:56.644
has been hard at work in the Bering Sea

00:07:56.668 --> 00:08:01.123
with the goal to help assess
the size of the pollock fish stock.

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:04.918
This helps improve the quota system
that's used to manage the fishery

00:08:04.942 --> 00:08:07.110
and help prevent a collapse
of the fish stock

00:08:07.134 --> 00:08:10.078
and protects this fragile ecosystem.

00:08:10.538 --> 00:08:15.347
Now, the drones survey
the fishing ground using acoustics,

00:08:15.371 --> 00:08:16.895
i.e., a sonar.

00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:20.140
This sends a sound wave downwards,

00:08:20.164 --> 00:08:22.674
and then the reflection,
the echo from the sound wave

00:08:22.698 --> 00:08:24.456
from the seabed or schools of fish,

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.390
gives us an idea of what's happening
below the surface.

00:08:27.849 --> 00:08:31.855
Our ocean drones are actually
pretty good at this repetitive task,

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:35.784
so they have been gridding
the Bering Sea day in, day out.

00:08:35.808 --> 00:08:42.767
Now, the Pribilof Islands are also
the home of a large colony of fur seals.

00:08:43.175 --> 00:08:47.664
In the 1950s, there were about
two million individuals in that colony.

00:08:48.374 --> 00:08:52.134
Sadly, these days,
the population has rapidly declined.

00:08:52.158 --> 00:08:54.501
There's less than 50 percent
of that number left,

00:08:54.525 --> 00:08:57.033
and the population
continues to fall rapidly.

00:08:57.904 --> 00:09:00.007
So to understand why,

00:09:00.031 --> 00:09:03.520
our science partner at
the National Marine Mammal Laboratory

00:09:03.544 --> 00:09:06.881
has fitted a GPS tag
on some of the mother seals,

00:09:06.905 --> 00:09:08.382
glued to their furs.

00:09:08.406 --> 00:09:11.407
And this tag measures location and depth

00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:13.763
and also has a really cool little camera

00:09:13.787 --> 00:09:16.183
that's triggered by sudden acceleration.

00:09:16.207 --> 00:09:20.121
Here is a movie taken
by an artistically inclined seal,

00:09:20.145 --> 00:09:23.886
giving us unprecedented insight
into an underwater hunt

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.724
deep in the Arctic,

00:09:25.748 --> 00:09:28.120
and the shot of this pollock prey

00:09:28.144 --> 00:09:30.910
just seconds before it gets devoured.

00:09:30.934 --> 00:09:34.720
Now, doing work in the Arctic
is very tough, even for a robot.

00:09:34.744 --> 00:09:37.334
They had to survive a snowstorm in August

00:09:37.358 --> 00:09:40.849
and interferences from bystanders --

00:09:40.873 --> 00:09:44.131
that little spotted seal enjoying a ride.

00:09:44.155 --> 00:09:46.716
(Laughter)

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:53.665
Now, the seal tags have recorded
over 200,000 dives over the season,

00:09:54.395 --> 00:09:56.354
and upon a closer look,

00:09:56.378 --> 00:10:00.909
we get to see the individual seal tracks
and the repetitive dives.

00:10:01.413 --> 00:10:04.270
We are on our way to decode
what is really happening

00:10:04.294 --> 00:10:05.973
over that foraging ground,

00:10:05.997 --> 00:10:07.342
and it's quite beautiful.

00:10:08.362 --> 00:10:11.765
Once you superimpose the acoustic data
collected by the drones,

00:10:11.789 --> 00:10:13.913
a picture starts to emerge.

00:10:13.937 --> 00:10:18.309
As the seals leave the islands
and swim from left to right,

00:10:18.333 --> 00:10:22.746
they are observed to dive at a relatively
shallow depth of about 20 meters,

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.859
which the drone identifies
is populated by small young pollock

00:10:26.883 --> 00:10:28.966
with low calorific content.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:33.114
The seals then swim much greater distance
and start to dive deeper

00:10:33.138 --> 00:10:37.810
to a place where the drone identifies
larger, more adult pollock,

00:10:37.834 --> 00:10:40.093
which are more nutritious as fish.

00:10:40.117 --> 00:10:44.239
Unfortunately, the calories expended
by the mother seals

00:10:44.263 --> 00:10:46.386
to swim this extra distance

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:51.326
don't leave them with enough energy
to lactate their pups back on the island,

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.384
leading to the population decline.

00:10:54.408 --> 00:10:59.755
Further, the drones identify that
the water temperature around the island

00:10:59.779 --> 00:11:01.464
has significantly warmed.

00:11:01.488 --> 00:11:05.788
It might be one of the driving forces
that's pushing the pollock north,

00:11:05.812 --> 00:11:08.267
and to spread in search of colder regions.

00:11:08.765 --> 00:11:10.550
So the data analysis is ongoing,

00:11:10.574 --> 00:11:13.953
but already we can see
that some of the pieces of the puzzle

00:11:13.977 --> 00:11:15.350
from the fur seal mystery

00:11:15.374 --> 00:11:16.975
are coming into focus.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.779
But if you look back at the big picture,

00:11:20.803 --> 00:11:22.304
we are mammals, too.

00:11:23.032 --> 00:11:26.856
And actually, the oceans provide
up to 20 kilos of fish per human per year.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.009
As we deplete our fish stocks,
what can we humans learn

00:11:30.033 --> 00:11:31.618
from the fur seal story?

00:11:32.719 --> 00:11:35.592
And beyond fish, the oceans
affect all of us daily

00:11:35.616 --> 00:11:37.490
as they drive global weather systems,

00:11:37.514 --> 00:11:40.275
which affect things like
global agricultural output

00:11:40.299 --> 00:11:43.928
or can lead to devastating destruction
of lives and property

00:11:43.952 --> 00:11:47.153
through hurricanes,
extreme heat and floods.

00:11:47.756 --> 00:11:51.536
Our oceans are pretty much
unexplored and undersampled,

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.997
and today, we still know more
about other planets than our own.

00:11:56.021 --> 00:11:59.809
But if you divide this vast ocean
in six-by-six-degree squares,

00:11:59.833 --> 00:12:02.650
each about 400 miles long,

00:12:03.539 --> 00:12:05.693
you'd get about 1,000 such squares.

00:12:05.717 --> 00:12:08.013
So little by little,
working with our partners,

00:12:08.037 --> 00:12:12.135
we are deploying one ocean drone
in each of those boxes,

00:12:12.159 --> 00:12:14.581
the hope being that
achieving planetary coverage

00:12:14.605 --> 00:12:17.785
will give us better insights
into those planetary systems

00:12:17.809 --> 00:12:19.120
that affect humanity.

00:12:19.603 --> 00:12:23.215
We have been using robots to study
distant worlds in our solar system

00:12:23.239 --> 00:12:24.429
for a while now.

00:12:24.939 --> 00:12:27.570
Now it is time to quantify our own planet,

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.279
because we cannot fix
what we cannot measure,

00:12:32.303 --> 00:12:35.195
and we cannot prepare
for what we don't know.

00:12:35.761 --> 00:12:36.921
Thank you.

00:12:36.945 --> 00:12:40.019
