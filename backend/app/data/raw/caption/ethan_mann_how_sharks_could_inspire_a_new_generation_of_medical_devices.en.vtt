00:00:10.782 --> 00:00:15.761
The US Navy has always had
this frustrating problem with their fleet.

00:00:16.402 --> 00:00:19.251
It's something called "fouling."

00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:22.362
Now, for all you non-seafaring folk,

00:00:22.362 --> 00:00:26.722
fouling is when things like algae
and barnacles and other marine materials

00:00:26.722 --> 00:00:29.322
get stuck to the sides
of ships and submarines.

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:32.573
Used to be able to prevent this fouling

00:00:32.573 --> 00:00:37.138
by coating ships and submarines
with toxic agents, like heavy metals,

00:00:37.138 --> 00:00:38.383
but these heavy metals

00:00:38.383 --> 00:00:41.630
aren't as effective at keeping
ships clean as they used to be.

00:00:42.263 --> 00:00:43.983
And we want clean ships

00:00:43.983 --> 00:00:46.924
because fouling on these vessels

00:00:46.924 --> 00:00:49.421
actually makes them
less efficient in the water

00:00:49.421 --> 00:00:52.692
and can be easier for enemies to detect.

00:00:53.322 --> 00:00:54.874
This is not good.

00:00:55.264 --> 00:00:58.301
So several years ago,
the US Office of Naval Research

00:00:58.301 --> 00:01:02.802
called on one of my colleagues,
engineer scientist Dr. Anthony Brennan,

00:01:02.802 --> 00:01:06.092
to devise a solution to prevent fouling

00:01:06.092 --> 00:01:08.192
without the use of these heavy metals.

00:01:08.712 --> 00:01:11.732
See, Dr. Brennan was already investigating

00:01:11.732 --> 00:01:14.003
how things like surface roughness

00:01:14.093 --> 00:01:17.712
can prevent the attachment
of organisms like algae.

00:01:18.482 --> 00:01:20.402
But Dr. Brennan was struggling.

00:01:21.012 --> 00:01:24.042
All of the engineered surfaces
he came up with

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:26.242
algae eventually overcame.

00:01:27.192 --> 00:01:30.963
And then Brennan found himself
at a conference in Hawaii, of all places,

00:01:31.163 --> 00:01:33.552
and noticed something rather intriguing.

00:01:34.252 --> 00:01:36.522
Take a look at these three animals:

00:01:36.852 --> 00:01:40.132
a manatee, a whale and a shark.

00:01:40.632 --> 00:01:42.254
What do you notice?

00:01:45.384 --> 00:01:46.381
Well, right.

00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:49.161
So the whale and the manatee are filthy,

00:01:49.541 --> 00:01:51.672
but the shark is squeaky clean.

00:01:52.992 --> 00:01:55.303
This is a property unique to all sharks.

00:01:56.083 --> 00:01:58.091
The next time you watch Shark Week,

00:01:58.091 --> 00:02:03.172
you'll notice each and every shark you see

00:02:03.642 --> 00:02:05.332
is pristine.

00:02:05.332 --> 00:02:06.603
(Laughter)

00:02:06.603 --> 00:02:08.192
Why?

00:02:08.632 --> 00:02:10.541
Brennan wanted to find out.

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:13.912
So with the help
of some brave graduate students,

00:02:13.912 --> 00:02:16.321
they set out to find a shark.

00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:18.381
(Laughter)

00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:20.262
They found one in the shallow water

00:02:20.262 --> 00:02:24.222
and carefully took a mold of its skin
using a dental impression material.

00:02:25.362 --> 00:02:26.363
Don't worry.

00:02:26.363 --> 00:02:30.249
The shark wasn't harmed in the process,
although I'm sure he didn't appreciate it.

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:31.249
(Laughter)

00:02:31.752 --> 00:02:35.821
So the students took the mold back
to the lab and put it under a microscope,

00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:38.332
and this is what it looks like.

00:02:38.332 --> 00:02:41.912
The sharkskin is comprised
of little denticles,

00:02:42.402 --> 00:02:47.383
and they overlap to create a diamond-shape
repeating pattern on the sharkskin.

00:02:48.393 --> 00:02:50.413
Upon further investigation,

00:02:50.413 --> 00:02:53.812
Brennan and his team noticed
that the texture on these denticles

00:02:53.812 --> 00:02:57.573
is actually what's responsible
for keeping sharks clean.

00:02:59.413 --> 00:03:02.452
I'm a microbiologist
and infectious disease expert,

00:03:02.452 --> 00:03:05.043
and I find this fascinating.

00:03:05.863 --> 00:03:09.104
I've spent my career
trying to keep surfaces clean,

00:03:10.244 --> 00:03:13.871
especially the surfaces
of medical devices.

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.964
In hospitals this is a massive problem.

00:03:16.964 --> 00:03:20.702
See, what happens is bacteria
who are really normally good

00:03:20.702 --> 00:03:23.012
find themselves in places
they shouldn't be

00:03:23.012 --> 00:03:25.652
as a result of some medical procedure.

00:03:26.672 --> 00:03:29.592
Sometime during or after surgery,

00:03:29.592 --> 00:03:33.271
bacteria latch onto the surface
of a medical device, stay there,

00:03:33.271 --> 00:03:35.523
and cause a serious infection;

00:03:35.523 --> 00:03:39.045
and this makes it impossible
for the body to heal.

00:03:39.805 --> 00:03:41.791
Take a look at these surgical wires

00:03:41.791 --> 00:03:45.870
used to close a patient's sternum
following open-heart surgery.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.312
Notice the tiny clusters
of bacteria on the surface?

00:03:51.142 --> 00:03:53.042
This patient didn't heal for months

00:03:53.042 --> 00:03:57.016
until the wires were removed,
and replaced with clean ones.

00:03:57.516 --> 00:03:58.618
You know, it used to be

00:03:58.618 --> 00:04:01.541
we just used antibiotics
to treat these types of infections.

00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:03.904
Antibiotics were an amazing drug,

00:04:03.904 --> 00:04:04.994
for a while.

00:04:05.164 --> 00:04:08.304
But eventually, bacteria were exposed
to antibiotics so frequently

00:04:08.304 --> 00:04:10.542
they were forced to adapt.

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:13.573
And survival is
the key driver of evolution,

00:04:13.573 --> 00:04:15.521
and that's what we're talking about here:

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:17.011
bacterial evolution.

00:04:17.481 --> 00:04:19.992
Perhaps you've heard
about this in the news.

00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:23.093
It's referred to
as "Antimicrobial Resistance."

00:04:23.473 --> 00:04:25.761
The US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention

00:04:25.761 --> 00:04:27.146
call antimicrobial resistance

00:04:27.146 --> 00:04:29.921
one of the greatest
public health challenges of our time.

00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:32.293
Illnesses that were once easily treatable

00:04:32.293 --> 00:04:33.973
are now untreatable.

00:04:34.373 --> 00:04:36.152
In the US alone every year,

00:04:36.152 --> 00:04:40.063
more than two million people will get
an antibiotic resistant infection,

00:04:40.063 --> 00:04:44.503
and over 23,000 people will die
as a result of that infection.

00:04:45.033 --> 00:04:46.323
The pharmaceutical industry

00:04:46.323 --> 00:04:51.043
is rushing to develop
more and more and more antimicrobials,

00:04:51.043 --> 00:04:54.903
desperately trying to outpace
antimicrobial resistance.

00:04:55.463 --> 00:04:56.813
But bacteria and germs,

00:04:56.813 --> 00:05:00.502
they evolve so much more quickly
than we could innovate ways to kill them.

00:05:01.822 --> 00:05:05.662
It's clear the antimicrobial era
is coming to an end,

00:05:05.662 --> 00:05:08.752
so we have to think about this
in a whole new way.

00:05:08.752 --> 00:05:13.012
What if instead of trying to kill bacteria
after they cause infections,

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:14.772
we simply make it harder for bacteria

00:05:14.772 --> 00:05:17.772
to stick to the surfaces
of medical devices in the first place?

00:05:17.772 --> 00:05:18.772
In other words,

00:05:18.772 --> 00:05:21.362
we prevent these infections
from occurring altogether.

00:05:22.112 --> 00:05:24.973
That's what brings me back
to what we've learned from sharks.

00:05:24.973 --> 00:05:28.999
It's the texture of sharkskin
that makes them resistant to fouling.

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.331
So what if we change
the texture of medical devices

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:36.532
to make them resistant to bacteria
causing so many problems?

00:05:37.402 --> 00:05:40.953
Dr. Brennan knew he had
a major medical breakthrough on his hands.

00:05:41.273 --> 00:05:45.041
He called up some trusted friends
right here in Denver Colorado,

00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:49.342
and they started a company,
and they called it Sharklet Technologies.

00:05:49.752 --> 00:05:52.622
In 2013, I joined the team,

00:05:52.622 --> 00:05:56.922
and together we used engineered surfaces
mimicking the skin of sharks

00:05:56.922 --> 00:06:00.674
to prevent bacteria
and other medical complications.

00:06:01.264 --> 00:06:04.432
Our first commercial device
is a urological catheter,

00:06:04.432 --> 00:06:08.652
which doctors began using
for patients just last year.

00:06:08.652 --> 00:06:12.062
(Applause)

00:06:12.062 --> 00:06:14.601
Take a look at these example images.

00:06:14.981 --> 00:06:17.883
The surface on the left
is a smooth surface,

00:06:17.883 --> 00:06:20.962
and the one on the right
is a sharkskin-like texture.

00:06:21.762 --> 00:06:24.512
Notice how much bacteria's
on the smooth surface

00:06:24.512 --> 00:06:26.972
compared to the sharkskin-like surface?

00:06:26.972 --> 00:06:30.102
This is because the sharkskin-like texture

00:06:30.102 --> 00:06:34.500
creates an inhospitable surface
for bacterial attachment and growth.

00:06:34.841 --> 00:06:37.401
It works on sharks, and it works here too

00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:41.452
because the texture takes advantage
of principles of surface energy.

00:06:41.931 --> 00:06:43.555
Now, surface energy

00:06:43.555 --> 00:06:47.345
is really a description
of a detailed property of a surface.

00:06:47.345 --> 00:06:52.234
It can include things like
water interaction or material stiffness.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.332
The roughened sharkskin-like texture

00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:58.413
creates a surface
with greater surface energy.

00:06:59.003 --> 00:07:01.963
You know, we interact
with surface energy changes all the time.

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:03.952
We often just don't notice it.

00:07:03.952 --> 00:07:08.492
For example, we like when rain beads up
and runs off our car, right?

00:07:08.492 --> 00:07:11.662
Well, this happens best
with a nice coat of wax.

00:07:11.662 --> 00:07:15.623
Wax is a material with greater
surface energy characteristics.

00:07:16.073 --> 00:07:18.411
Now, we can't coat medical devices in wax,

00:07:18.411 --> 00:07:21.062
but we can change their surface texture.

00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:24.492
And this approach works
on all types of medical devices,

00:07:24.492 --> 00:07:26.501
from catheters to pacemakers,

00:07:26.501 --> 00:07:30.092
and it's effective against all types
of bacteria and germs.

00:07:30.652 --> 00:07:32.032
As it turns out,

00:07:32.462 --> 00:07:35.953
we can actually do more
than just bacteria-proof medical devices.

00:07:36.423 --> 00:07:39.161
We can prevent other medical complications

00:07:39.161 --> 00:07:41.672
through understanding
the power of surface energy,

00:07:41.862 --> 00:07:44.747
things like frequent clogging,

00:07:44.957 --> 00:07:46.612
excessive blood clotting

00:07:46.612 --> 00:07:48.443
or poor healing interactions.

00:07:48.673 --> 00:07:51.292
The next generation
of medical device surfaces

00:07:51.292 --> 00:07:53.092
inspired by the skin of sharks

00:07:53.092 --> 00:07:56.403
will actually expand
how medical devices are made.

00:07:56.845 --> 00:07:57.887
Really the core issue

00:07:57.887 --> 00:08:01.722
is that we create all types
of sophisticated medical devices,

00:08:01.722 --> 00:08:04.002
things to pump fluid into our blood,

00:08:04.212 --> 00:08:05.753
keep our heart beating on pace,

00:08:05.753 --> 00:08:07.924
or even stimulate brain activity.

00:08:07.924 --> 00:08:09.665
But bad things happen

00:08:09.665 --> 00:08:13.551
when these devices don't interact well
with our bodies' natural mechanisms.

00:08:13.961 --> 00:08:15.252
We've actually discovered

00:08:15.252 --> 00:08:18.402
that we can improve
how medical devices are tolerated

00:08:18.402 --> 00:08:21.582
through subtly tuning
the surface energy characteristics,

00:08:22.082 --> 00:08:25.522
like for example, we can prevent
a lot of the excessive clotting

00:08:25.522 --> 00:08:28.031
that's occurring here
on the smooth surface,

00:08:28.031 --> 00:08:30.322
compared to the sharkskin-like texture.

00:08:31.182 --> 00:08:34.983
This means that we can actually
match the required surface energy

00:08:34.983 --> 00:08:37.023
with the medical use

00:08:37.023 --> 00:08:38.952
to prevent complications,

00:08:38.952 --> 00:08:41.172
all with the power of sharks.

00:08:41.852 --> 00:08:45.702
Ultimately, as we continue
to engineer smart surfaces,

00:08:46.002 --> 00:08:48.612
we'll require fewer antimicrobials,

00:08:48.612 --> 00:08:51.952
fewer chemicals
and fewer harsh additives,

00:08:51.952 --> 00:08:54.903
and this will make
life-saving medical technology

00:08:54.903 --> 00:08:57.383
safer for all of us to use.

00:08:57.863 --> 00:09:01.002
This is innovation
in its purest form, to be sure.

00:09:01.002 --> 00:09:02.931
But it's also a good reminder

00:09:02.931 --> 00:09:06.611
of just how important it is
to observe the subtle cues

00:09:06.611 --> 00:09:09.433
in the raw mystery of the world around us.

00:09:09.433 --> 00:09:10.502
Thank you.

00:09:10.502 --> 00:09:13.553
(Applause)
