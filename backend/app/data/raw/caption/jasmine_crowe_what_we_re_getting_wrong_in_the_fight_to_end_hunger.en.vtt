00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:15.214
In June of 2017,

00:00:15.238 --> 00:00:18.837
I volunteered with a group
at a local food pantry

00:00:18.861 --> 00:00:21.486
on the south side of my home city

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.949
in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:24.933
It was a Friday afternoon,

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:27.185
the day of their weekly food giveaway.

00:00:27.209 --> 00:00:28.368
And as I drove up,

00:00:28.392 --> 00:00:30.366
I saw people beginning to arrive,

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.312
many with their rolling carts in tow,

00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:35.094
prepared to receive
their food supply for the week.

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:38.134
As I was walking in the door,
there were about 40 people outside

00:00:38.158 --> 00:00:39.347
waiting in line.

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:40.821
And I was so excited,

00:00:40.845 --> 00:00:44.219
because there are very few things
I enjoy more than giving back.

00:00:44.538 --> 00:00:48.805
But then, as I entered the room where
the volunteer meeting was taking place,

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.501
I immediately realized:

00:00:50.525 --> 00:00:53.014
we weren't about to give
these people any real meals.

00:00:53.038 --> 00:00:55.284
We were essentially just giving them food.

00:00:55.634 --> 00:00:58.438
I took my place on the assembly line,
where -- get this --

00:00:58.462 --> 00:01:01.589
I was in charge of making sure
that the Weight Watchers Ding Dongs

00:01:01.613 --> 00:01:03.640
made it into every family's bag.

00:01:04.202 --> 00:01:06.484
As the bags started to come around,

00:01:06.508 --> 00:01:08.054
I'm thinking to myself:

00:01:08.078 --> 00:01:09.718
What on earth are we doing here?

00:01:10.234 --> 00:01:13.899
Each bag contained
two 20-ounce diet Snapples,

00:01:13.923 --> 00:01:16.212
a gallon of barbecue sauce,

00:01:16.236 --> 00:01:18.730
a bag of kettle potato chips,

00:01:18.754 --> 00:01:23.339
a box of superhero-shaped
vegetable-enriched macaroni noodles,

00:01:23.363 --> 00:01:26.058
a box of belVita breakfast bars,

00:01:26.082 --> 00:01:28.092
a can of refried beans,

00:01:28.116 --> 00:01:29.857
a can of sweet peas,

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:31.732
a miniature can of corn,

00:01:31.756 --> 00:01:33.814
I can't forget about those Ding Dongs

00:01:33.838 --> 00:01:35.552
and french fried green onions,

00:01:35.576 --> 00:01:38.613
you know, the kind that go
on top of a green bean casserole.

00:01:38.637 --> 00:01:39.838
And that was it.

00:01:40.303 --> 00:01:42.953
We made over a hundred
of those bags that day,

00:01:42.977 --> 00:01:45.579
and people indeed
stood in line to receive one.

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:47.802
But a feeling came over me;

00:01:47.826 --> 00:01:50.363
I felt bad and a little angry.

00:01:50.387 --> 00:01:53.751
It was like, how could I even feel good
about the work that I was doing

00:01:53.775 --> 00:01:56.279
when I knew for a fact
that not one meal was to come

00:01:56.303 --> 00:01:59.456
from the food we had just given
to over 100 families?

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.792
I mean, who wants to have
a meal with barbecue sauce and Ding Dongs?

00:02:02.816 --> 00:02:03.843
(Laughter)

00:02:03.867 --> 00:02:05.346
And the reality is,

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.781
I've been part
of this process all my life.

00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:09.788
I've participated in food drives,

00:02:09.812 --> 00:02:12.078
I've collected cans since I was a kid,

00:02:12.102 --> 00:02:15.207
I've donated in the grocery store
more times than I can count,

00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:18.482
I've volunteered at shelters,
I've worked in food pantries,

00:02:18.506 --> 00:02:21.035
and I'm sure, like me,
so many of you have, too.

00:02:21.444 --> 00:02:25.252
In 2013, I even created
a pop-up restaurant,

00:02:25.276 --> 00:02:26.696
called Sunday Soul.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.979
And I rented tables and chairs and linens

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:30.517
and I printed out menus

00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:33.042
and I took these experiences to alleyways,

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:35.137
underneath bridges and in parks

00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:37.893
to allow people that were
experiencing homelessness

00:02:37.917 --> 00:02:39.373
to dine with dignity.

00:02:39.848 --> 00:02:42.595
So I've invested in this fight
for quite some time.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.875
In almost every major US city,

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:49.693
the food bank is viewed
as a beloved community institution.

00:02:49.717 --> 00:02:53.457
Corporations send volunteers down
on a weekly basis

00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:56.892
to sort through food items
and make boxes of food for the needy.

00:02:57.298 --> 00:02:58.471
And can drives --

00:02:58.495 --> 00:03:02.273
they warm the hearts of schools
and office buildings that participate

00:03:02.297 --> 00:03:06.134
and fill the shelves of food banks
and food pantries across the nation.

00:03:06.158 --> 00:03:07.988
This is how we work to end hunger.

00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:10.267
And what I've come to realize

00:03:10.291 --> 00:03:11.969
is that we are doing hunger wrong.

00:03:12.385 --> 00:03:14.085
We are doing the same things

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.148
over and over and over again

00:03:17.172 --> 00:03:19.210
and expecting a different end result.

00:03:19.545 --> 00:03:21.179
We've created a cycle

00:03:21.203 --> 00:03:25.313
that keeps people dependent on food banks
and pantries on a monthly basis

00:03:25.337 --> 00:03:27.559
for food that is often not well-balanced

00:03:27.583 --> 00:03:30.343
and certainly doesn't provide them
with a healthy meal.

00:03:30.848 --> 00:03:33.277
In the US, our approach to doing good,

00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:34.991
or what we call "charity,"

00:03:35.015 --> 00:03:37.806
has actually hindered us
from making real progress.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.362
We're educating the world
on how many people are food insecure.

00:03:41.386 --> 00:03:43.172
There are television commercials,

00:03:43.196 --> 00:03:44.362
billboards,

00:03:44.386 --> 00:03:45.669
massive donations,

00:03:45.693 --> 00:03:48.719
the engagement of some
of our biggest celebrities in the fight.

00:03:48.743 --> 00:03:51.018
But the ever-present reality is that,

00:03:51.042 --> 00:03:52.659
even with all of this work,

00:03:52.683 --> 00:03:54.881
millions of people are still going hungry.

00:03:54.905 --> 00:03:56.226
And we can do better.

00:03:56.623 --> 00:03:59.653
Globally, 821 million people are hungry.

00:04:00.086 --> 00:04:02.503
That's one in nine people on this planet.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.569
And here in the United States,

00:04:04.593 --> 00:04:07.927
nearly 40 million people
experience hunger every single year,

00:04:07.951 --> 00:04:10.439
including more than 11 million children

00:04:10.463 --> 00:04:12.472
that go to bed hungry every night.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.604
Yet, we're wasting more food
than ever before --

00:04:15.628 --> 00:04:17.565
more than 80 billion pounds a year,

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:18.921
to be exact.

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:22.472
The EPA estimates that food waste
has more than doubled

00:04:22.496 --> 00:04:25.895
between 1970 and 2017,

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.604
and now accounts for 27 percent
of everything in our landfills.

00:04:29.628 --> 00:04:32.185
And as this food sits,
it gradually rots

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:34.110
and produces harmful methane gas,

00:04:34.134 --> 00:04:36.617
a leading contributor
to global climate change.

00:04:37.051 --> 00:04:38.999
We have the waste of the food itself,

00:04:39.023 --> 00:04:43.327
the waste of all the money associated
with producing this now-wasted food

00:04:43.351 --> 00:04:46.062
and the waste of labor
with all of the above.

00:04:46.086 --> 00:04:48.003
And then there's the social inequity

00:04:48.027 --> 00:04:51.402
between people who really
need food and can't get it

00:04:51.426 --> 00:04:54.290
and people who have too much
and simply throw it away.

00:04:54.885 --> 00:04:58.956
All of this made me realize
that hunger was not an issue of scarcity

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.182
but rather a matter of logistics.

00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:05.585
So in 2017, I set out
to end hunger using technology.

00:05:05.984 --> 00:05:09.949
After all, food delivery apps
had begun to explode on the scene,

00:05:09.973 --> 00:05:13.460
and I thought surely we can
reverse-engineer this technology

00:05:13.484 --> 00:05:16.846
and get food from businesses
like restaurants and grocery stores

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.200
and into the hands of people in need.

00:05:19.224 --> 00:05:21.438
I believe that technology and innovation

00:05:21.462 --> 00:05:23.595
have the power to solve real problems,

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:24.931
especially hunger.

00:05:25.334 --> 00:05:28.660
So in 2017, I created an app

00:05:28.684 --> 00:05:31.267
that would inventory everything
that a business sells

00:05:31.291 --> 00:05:34.073
and make it super easy for them
to donate this excess food

00:05:34.097 --> 00:05:36.782
that would typically go to waste
at the end of the night.

00:05:36.806 --> 00:05:39.301
All the user has to do now
is click on an item,

00:05:39.325 --> 00:05:41.215
tell us how many they have to donate,

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:43.872
and our platform calculates
the weight and the tax value

00:05:43.896 --> 00:05:45.730
of those items at time of donation.

00:05:45.754 --> 00:05:48.458
We then connect with local drivers
in the shared economy

00:05:48.482 --> 00:05:51.397
to get this food picked up
and delivered directly to the doors

00:05:51.421 --> 00:05:54.024
of nonprofit organizations
and people in need.

00:05:54.048 --> 00:05:56.271
I provided the data and the analytics

00:05:56.295 --> 00:05:58.908
to help businesses reduce
food waste at the source

00:05:58.932 --> 00:06:02.129
by letting them know the items
that they waste repeatedly

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:03.753
on a regular basis,

00:06:03.777 --> 00:06:05.790
and they even saved millions of dollars.

00:06:05.814 --> 00:06:07.373
Our mission was simple:

00:06:07.397 --> 00:06:09.487
feed more, waste less.

00:06:09.511 --> 00:06:13.152
And by 2018, our clients included
the world's busiest airport,

00:06:13.176 --> 00:06:15.136
Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.819
and we were working
with brands and corporations

00:06:17.843 --> 00:06:20.563
like Hormel, Chick-fil-A and Papa John's.

00:06:20.587 --> 00:06:24.820
We even had the opportunity
to work with the NFL for Super Bowl LIII.

00:06:24.844 --> 00:06:28.093
And over the last two years,
we've worked with over 200 business

00:06:28.117 --> 00:06:31.807
to divert more than two million pounds
of edible food from landfills

00:06:31.831 --> 00:06:34.111
into the hands of people
that needed it most.

00:06:34.135 --> 00:06:35.842
(Applause)

00:06:35.866 --> 00:06:37.042
Thank you.

00:06:37.066 --> 00:06:40.629
(Applause)

00:06:43.574 --> 00:06:46.485
This has accounted
for about 1.7 million meals

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:49.671
and allowed us to start to expand
our efforts to other cities,

00:06:49.695 --> 00:06:53.726
like Washington, DC, Chicago,
Miami, Philadelphia and more.

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.707
That's just one approach
that actually tackles the problem.

00:06:56.731 --> 00:06:59.498
Another was the launch
of our pop-up grocery stores.

00:06:59.522 --> 00:07:01.898
We recover excess food from businesses

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:05.636
and set up free community grocery stores
right in the middle of food deserts.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.946
We bring out a chef,

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.151
and we do on-site taste-testings and allow
families to leave with recipe cards.

00:07:11.175 --> 00:07:14.802
We give every family reusable grocery bags
and allow them to simply shop

00:07:14.826 --> 00:07:16.464
minus the price tag.

00:07:16.488 --> 00:07:19.572
We wanted to give people access to meals

00:07:19.596 --> 00:07:21.018
and not just food.

00:07:21.042 --> 00:07:25.036
We wanted to change the way that we think
and work to solve hunger in this country,

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.265
get people to believe
that we can solve hunger,

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:28.606
not as a nonprofit,

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:29.884
not as a food bank

00:07:29.908 --> 00:07:31.510
but as a social enterprise,

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:34.402
with the goal of reducing waste
and ending hunger.

00:07:34.426 --> 00:07:36.354
But it hasn't been as easy as I thought

00:07:36.378 --> 00:07:38.625
to change the narrative
and the thought process

00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:40.910
on how we think that hunger can be solved.

00:07:41.487 --> 00:07:44.544
In 2016, France became the first country

00:07:44.568 --> 00:07:47.973
to ban supermarkets
from throwing away unused food.

00:07:47.997 --> 00:07:49.696
Instead, they must donate it,

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.657
and they're fined if they don't.

00:07:51.681 --> 00:07:52.837
Yes.

00:07:52.861 --> 00:07:56.139
(Applause)

00:07:56.163 --> 00:07:58.883
In 2017, Italy followed suit,

00:07:58.907 --> 00:08:00.852
becoming the second European nation

00:08:00.876 --> 00:08:03.160
to pass an anti-food-waste ban.

00:08:03.184 --> 00:08:06.456
And they stated it so simply
as it was passed through legislation:

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.767
"We have millions of pounds
of good food going to waste,

00:08:09.791 --> 00:08:12.044
and we have poor people
that are going hungry."

00:08:12.068 --> 00:08:13.333
That simple.

00:08:13.357 --> 00:08:16.521
Denmark now has a mandated
food waste grocery store.

00:08:16.545 --> 00:08:18.216
Its name: Wefood.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.993
They recover excess food
from local grocery stores

00:08:21.017 --> 00:08:23.838
and sell it at up to
a 50 percent off discount.

00:08:23.862 --> 00:08:28.041
They then use all the proceeds
and donate it to emergency aid programs

00:08:28.065 --> 00:08:31.131
and social need issues
for the people in need.

00:08:31.155 --> 00:08:34.608
It has been hailed as
"the Goodwill of grocery."

00:08:34.948 --> 00:08:39.137
And last year, the world got its first
pay-what-you-can grocery store,

00:08:39.161 --> 00:08:41.500
when Feed it Forward opened in Toronto.

00:08:41.524 --> 00:08:45.772
Their shelves remain stocked
by recovering excess food

00:08:45.796 --> 00:08:47.008
from major supermarkets

00:08:47.032 --> 00:08:49.766
and allowing families
to simply pay what they can

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.477
at their grocery store.

00:08:51.501 --> 00:08:53.167
This is amazing.

00:08:53.191 --> 00:08:56.149
This innovation we need more of.

00:08:56.967 --> 00:09:00.168
Everyone can take on the roles
of changing the attitudes

00:09:00.192 --> 00:09:02.001
about how we solve hunger.

00:09:02.025 --> 00:09:04.863
When we think of how we've allowed
innovation and technology

00:09:04.887 --> 00:09:06.063
to change our lives,

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:07.974
from how we communicate with each other

00:09:07.998 --> 00:09:09.775
to how we view our entertainment

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.436
to how we even receive food,

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.321
it's amazing that we haven't
solved hunger yet.

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:17.019
We literally have cars
that can drive themselves

00:09:17.043 --> 00:09:19.634
and millions of people
that cannot feed themselves.

00:09:20.142 --> 00:09:23.459
With millions of dollars being donated
to end food insecurity,

00:09:23.483 --> 00:09:25.607
we should've solved hunger years ago.

00:09:25.631 --> 00:09:27.124
And I asked myself --

00:09:27.148 --> 00:09:29.977
(Applause)

00:09:31.746 --> 00:09:34.832
I asked myself, why can't we
escape this vicious cycle?

00:09:34.856 --> 00:09:36.776
Why haven't we solved this problem?

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.438
I remember meeting with investors
and pitching the idea,

00:09:39.462 --> 00:09:41.416
trying to raise funds for my business,

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.975
and one of them said to me,
in true seriousness,

00:09:43.999 --> 00:09:45.981
"Hunger is already being solved,"

00:09:46.005 --> 00:09:49.576
as if millions of people weren't going
to go to bed hungry that very night,

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.518
and as if there was nothing else to do.

00:09:51.542 --> 00:09:52.697
And the reality is,

00:09:52.721 --> 00:09:54.821
one would think
that hunger is being solved,

00:09:54.845 --> 00:09:57.010
but the truth is, it's being worked on.

00:09:57.034 --> 00:09:58.661
If we really want to solve hunger,

00:09:58.685 --> 00:10:01.122
then we have to change
the way we've been doing it.

00:10:01.146 --> 00:10:04.386
The same actions will always
garner the same results.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:07.352
There are hundreds of social
entrepreneurs all over the world.

00:10:07.376 --> 00:10:11.390
They have a focus to solve
really big problems, like hunger,

00:10:11.414 --> 00:10:13.243
but they'll never get the same support

00:10:13.267 --> 00:10:16.432
that we give national hunger-fighting
organizations and food banks.

00:10:16.456 --> 00:10:18.241
But, if given the opportunity,

00:10:18.265 --> 00:10:20.675
they have the ability to foster insight

00:10:20.699 --> 00:10:22.599
and perhaps be forward-thinking enough

00:10:22.623 --> 00:10:24.041
to solve this problem.

00:10:24.065 --> 00:10:25.693
That's why I'm traveling the world

00:10:25.717 --> 00:10:28.693
and I'm really talking about
what hunger looks like in America

00:10:28.717 --> 00:10:31.912
and explaining the difference between
giving people access to food

00:10:31.936 --> 00:10:33.363
and access to meals.

00:10:33.387 --> 00:10:35.421
I've been meeting
with city council members

00:10:35.445 --> 00:10:37.583
and city organizers across the US

00:10:37.607 --> 00:10:40.929
and telling them that technology
indeed does have the power

00:10:40.953 --> 00:10:43.129
to connect businesses with surplus food

00:10:43.153 --> 00:10:44.408
to people in need,

00:10:44.432 --> 00:10:47.866
and explaining to them
what a meal can actually mean to a family.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:50.595
I've been meeting with school boards
and school districts

00:10:50.619 --> 00:10:52.665
to talk about how we feed hungry children,

00:10:52.689 --> 00:10:54.155
and health care organizations,

00:10:54.179 --> 00:10:56.167
sharing the message that food is health,

00:10:56.191 --> 00:10:57.561
and food is life,

00:10:57.585 --> 00:11:01.008
and that, by solving hunger,
we can solve so many more problems.

00:11:01.564 --> 00:11:02.980
So if we want to know

00:11:03.004 --> 00:11:04.845
that we don't live in a nation

00:11:04.869 --> 00:11:06.999
where perfectly good food goes to waste

00:11:07.023 --> 00:11:09.283
when our neighbors don't have food to eat,

00:11:09.307 --> 00:11:11.352
then we need to change the laws.

00:11:11.376 --> 00:11:13.369
We need to introduce new policies,

00:11:13.393 --> 00:11:16.817
and, most importantly, we need to change
our minds and our actions.

00:11:16.841 --> 00:11:18.301
Food drives are fine.

00:11:18.325 --> 00:11:20.420
Food banks serve a huge purpose.

00:11:20.444 --> 00:11:23.174
And yes, sometimes I like Ding Dongs, too.

00:11:23.198 --> 00:11:26.821
But the reality is that food drives
do not solve hunger.

00:11:26.845 --> 00:11:29.050
And if we are smart
about connecting the dots

00:11:29.074 --> 00:11:30.881
that are right in front of our noses,

00:11:30.905 --> 00:11:32.891
we can do far more than give a family

00:11:32.915 --> 00:11:37.169
a box of superhero-shaped
vegetable-enriched macaroni noodles

00:11:37.193 --> 00:11:38.687
and a gallon of barbecue sauce

00:11:38.711 --> 00:11:40.162
to feed themselves.

00:11:40.186 --> 00:11:42.298
Instead, we can
give them back their dignity.

00:11:42.322 --> 00:11:45.716
Perhaps we can increase
school attendance in schools.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.459
We can improve the health
outcomes for millions.

00:11:48.483 --> 00:11:51.907
And, most importantly, we can reduce
food waste in our landfills,

00:11:51.931 --> 00:11:54.529
creating a better
environment for all of us.

00:11:54.553 --> 00:11:58.537
The thing I love most is that
we can feel good about it in the process.

00:11:58.561 --> 00:11:59.723
If we solve hunger,

00:11:59.747 --> 00:12:02.565
we have nothing to lose
and everything to gain.

00:12:02.589 --> 00:12:03.761
So let's do it.

00:12:03.785 --> 00:12:05.004
Thank you.

00:12:05.028 --> 00:12:07.456
(Applause)

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.653
Thank you.
