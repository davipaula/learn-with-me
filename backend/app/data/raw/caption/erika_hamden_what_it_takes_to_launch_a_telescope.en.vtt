00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.791
I'm an astronomer who builds telescopes.

00:00:16.563 --> 00:00:20.524
I build telescopes because,
number one, they are awesome.

00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:23.330
But number two,

00:00:23.354 --> 00:00:27.062
I believe if you want to discover
a new thing about the universe,

00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:28.618
you have to look at the universe

00:00:28.642 --> 00:00:29.870
in a new way.

00:00:30.378 --> 00:00:32.227
New technologies in astronomy --

00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:35.849
things like lenses, photographic plates,

00:00:35.873 --> 00:00:38.288
all the way up to space telescopes --

00:00:38.312 --> 00:00:41.404
each gave us new ways to see the universe

00:00:41.428 --> 00:00:44.133
and directly led to a new understanding

00:00:44.157 --> 00:00:45.307
of our place in it.

00:00:46.663 --> 00:00:49.038
But those discoveries come with a cost.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.091
It took thousands of people and 44 years

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:56.924
to get the Hubble Space Telescope
from an idea into orbit.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.903
It takes time,

00:00:58.927 --> 00:01:00.745
it takes a tolerance for failure,

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.707
it takes individual people

00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:05.501
choosing every day not to give up.

00:01:06.247 --> 00:01:09.196
I know how hard that choice is
because I live it.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.278
The reality of my job is that I fail
almost all the time and still keep going,

00:01:15.302 --> 00:01:17.684
because that's how telescopes get built.

00:01:18.754 --> 00:01:20.593
The telescope I helped build is called

00:01:20.617 --> 00:01:25.873
the faint intergalactic-medium
red-shifted emission balloon,

00:01:25.897 --> 00:01:27.516
which is a mouthful,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.895
so we call it "FIREBall."

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:32.678
And don't worry, it is not going
to explode at the end of this story.

00:01:34.137 --> 00:01:36.648
I've been working on FIREBall
for more than 10 years

00:01:36.672 --> 00:01:40.109
and now lead the team
of incredible people who built it.

00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:44.871
FIREBall is designed to observe
some of the faintest structures known:

00:01:44.895 --> 00:01:47.775
huge clouds of hydrogen gas.

00:01:48.435 --> 00:01:49.734
These clouds are giant.

00:01:49.758 --> 00:01:52.296
They are even bigger than
whatever you're thinking of.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.505
They are huge,

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:56.849
huge clouds of hydrogen that we think
flow into and out of galaxies.

00:01:57.521 --> 00:01:59.369
I work on FIREBall

00:01:59.393 --> 00:02:02.577
because what I really want
is to take our view of the universe

00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:05.765
from one with just light from stars

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:11.157
to one where we can see and measure
every atom that exists.

00:02:11.711 --> 00:02:13.192
That's all that I want to do.

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:15.208
(Laughter)

00:02:15.232 --> 00:02:17.442
But observing at least some of those atoms

00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:21.237
is crucial to our understanding
of why galaxies look the way they do.

00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:22.603
I want to know

00:02:22.627 --> 00:02:26.615
how that hydrogen gas
gets into a galaxy and creates a star.

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.516
My work on FIREBall started in 2008,

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.438
working not on the telescope
but on the light sensor,

00:02:33.462 --> 00:02:35.541
which is the heart of any telescope.

00:02:36.153 --> 00:02:38.939
This new sensor was being developed
by a team that I joined

00:02:38.963 --> 00:02:40.867
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.866
And our goal was to prove
that this sensor would work really well

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.650
to detect that hydrogen gas.

00:02:48.618 --> 00:02:49.991
In my work on this,

00:02:50.015 --> 00:02:57.011
I destroyed several very,
very, very expensive sensors

00:02:57.035 --> 00:02:59.142
before realizing that
the machine I was using

00:02:59.166 --> 00:03:02.968
created a plasma that shorted out
anything electrical that we put in it.

00:03:03.414 --> 00:03:06.183
We used a different machine,
there were other challenges,

00:03:06.207 --> 00:03:08.184
and it took years to get it right.

00:03:08.208 --> 00:03:10.852
But when that first sensor worked,

00:03:10.876 --> 00:03:13.074
it was glorious.

00:03:13.098 --> 00:03:17.005
And our sensors are now 10 times better
than the previous state of the art

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:19.977
and are getting put into
all kinds of new telescopes.

00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:24.899
Our sensors will give us a new way
to see the universe and our place in it.

00:03:26.035 --> 00:03:28.120
So, sensors done,

00:03:28.144 --> 00:03:29.470
time to build a telescope.

00:03:29.494 --> 00:03:33.108
And FIREBall is weird
as far as telescopes go,

00:03:33.132 --> 00:03:36.124
because it's not in space,
and it's not on the ground.

00:03:36.148 --> 00:03:39.636
Instead, it hangs on a cable
from a giant balloon

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.685
and observes for one night only

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.468
from 130,000 feet in the stratosphere,

00:03:45.492 --> 00:03:48.259
at the very edge of space.

00:03:48.283 --> 00:03:53.159
This is partly because the edge of space
is much cheaper than actual space.

00:03:53.183 --> 00:03:54.427
(Laughter)

00:03:54.451 --> 00:03:58.067
So building it, of course, more failures:

00:03:58.908 --> 00:04:00.077
mirrors that failed,

00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:02.054
scratched mirrors that had to be remade;

00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:03.937
cooling system failures,

00:04:03.961 --> 00:04:06.128
an entire system that had to be remade;

00:04:06.731 --> 00:04:12.828
calibration failures, we ran tests
again and again and again and again;

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:15.266
failures when you literally
least expect them:

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.196
we had an adorable but super angry
baby falcon that landed

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.120
on our spectrograph tank one day.

00:04:21.144 --> 00:04:22.173
(Laughter)

00:04:22.197 --> 00:04:24.387
Although to be fair,
this was the greatest day

00:04:24.411 --> 00:04:26.003
in the history of this project.

00:04:26.027 --> 00:04:27.210
(Laughter)

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:29.500
I really loved that falcon.

00:04:30.209 --> 00:04:33.361
But falcon damage fixed, we got it built

00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:35.610
for an August 2017 launch attempt --

00:04:35.634 --> 00:04:37.764
and then failed to launch,

00:04:37.788 --> 00:04:42.568
due to six weeks of continuous rain
in the New Mexico desert.

00:04:42.592 --> 00:04:45.120
(Laughter)

00:04:45.144 --> 00:04:47.108
Our spirits dampened, we showed up again,

00:04:47.132 --> 00:04:49.735
August 2018, year 10.

00:04:50.247 --> 00:04:53.287
And on the morning of September 22nd,

00:04:56.611 --> 00:04:59.046
we finally got the telescope launched.

00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:04.214
(Applause)

00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:08.960
I have put so much of myself --
my whole life -- into this project,

00:05:08.984 --> 00:05:11.933
and I, like, still can't believe
that that happened.

00:05:12.663 --> 00:05:16.380
And I have this picture that's taken
right around sunset on that day

00:05:16.404 --> 00:05:19.158
of our balloon,

00:05:19.182 --> 00:05:20.379
FIREBall hanging from it,

00:05:20.383 --> 00:05:22.021
and the nearly full moon.

00:05:22.045 --> 00:05:23.290
And I love this picture.

00:05:23.314 --> 00:05:25.520
God, I love it.

00:05:27.092 --> 00:05:28.244
But I look at it,

00:05:28.268 --> 00:05:29.698
and it makes me want to cry,

00:05:30.751 --> 00:05:35.013
because when fully inflated,
these balloons are spherical,

00:05:35.037 --> 00:05:36.553
and this one isn't.

00:05:36.577 --> 00:05:38.553
It's shaped like a teardrop.

00:05:38.577 --> 00:05:41.902
And that's because there is a hole in it.

00:05:43.104 --> 00:05:45.133
Sometimes balloons fail, too.

00:05:45.856 --> 00:05:48.208
FIREBall crash-landed
in the New Mexico desert,

00:05:48.232 --> 00:05:50.537
and we didn't get the data that we wanted.

00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:54.498
And at the end of that day,
I thought to myself,

00:05:54.522 --> 00:05:56.172
"Why am I doing this?"

00:05:57.545 --> 00:06:00.559
And I've thought a lot
about why since that day.

00:06:01.202 --> 00:06:05.634
And I've realized that all of my work
has been full of things

00:06:05.658 --> 00:06:07.140
that break and fail,

00:06:07.164 --> 00:06:09.719
that we don't understand and they fail,

00:06:09.743 --> 00:06:12.001
that we just get wrong the first time,

00:06:12.025 --> 00:06:13.488
and so they fail.

00:06:13.512 --> 00:06:16.085
I think about the thousands
of people who built Hubble

00:06:16.109 --> 00:06:18.062
and how many failures they endured.

00:06:18.086 --> 00:06:21.219
There were countless failures,
heartbreaking failures,

00:06:21.243 --> 00:06:22.925
even when it was in space.

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:26.516
And none of those failures
were a reason for them to give up.

00:06:27.541 --> 00:06:29.088
I think about why I love my job.

00:06:29.112 --> 00:06:31.539
I want to know what
is happening in the universe.

00:06:31.563 --> 00:06:34.359
You all want to know
what's happening in the universe, too.

00:06:34.383 --> 00:06:36.717
I want to know what's going on
with that hydrogen.

00:06:37.891 --> 00:06:41.370
And so I've realized
that discovery is mostly a process

00:06:41.394 --> 00:06:43.233
of finding things that don't work,

00:06:43.257 --> 00:06:47.000
and failure is inevitable when
you're pushing the limits of knowledge.

00:06:47.024 --> 00:06:48.630
And that's what I want to do.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.457
So I'm choosing to keep going.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.642
And our team is going to do

00:06:53.666 --> 00:06:57.849
what everyone who has ever
built anything before us has done:

00:06:57.873 --> 00:06:59.109
we're going to try again,

00:06:59.133 --> 00:07:00.313
in 2020.

00:07:00.648 --> 00:07:05.603
And it might feel like a failure today --
and it really does --

00:07:05.627 --> 00:07:07.908
but it's only going to stay a failure

00:07:07.932 --> 00:07:09.538
if I give up.

00:07:09.562 --> 00:07:10.790
Thank you very much.

00:07:10.814 --> 00:07:17.093
(Applause)
