00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.960
[This talk contains graphic images]

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.720
My parents always wanted me
to be a doctor.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.976
But a doctor that studies
how vultures eat dead things

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.176
is probably not the type of doctor
my parents had in mind.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.936
(Laughter)

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.216
I study vulture scavenging behavior
and how vultures affect crime scenes.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.576
I'm here to talk to you
about how we take vultures for granted

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.960
in forensic science.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.016
Before we do that,
I want to tell you a story.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.816
So we're going to take a trip,
all 1,000 of us.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.896
It's May 2014 and we're standing in a park
in Nashville, Tennessee,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.816
because we've been at a horse race.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.096
As we wait for the porta potty,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.976
we see two ladies in their Sunday best:

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.096
heels, pearls and lovely,
floppy derby hats.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.536
At any moment, we expect them
to start talking

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.016
about their grandma's fine china.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.656
But they don't.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.536
Instead, we hear them say,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.936
"Oh, look.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.536
Something must be dead."

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.736
We look up and to the left
and see vultures circling round and round.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.576
It occurred to me at this very moment

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.576
that if these ladies at the derby

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.856
are aware of vulture's
connection to death,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.400
then why aren't we talking more
about these birds at crime scenes?

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.240
People know that vultures
are connected to death.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.720
But they don't really understand how.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.200
For example, here's an email
I received from a detective in Louisiana:

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.336
"Lauren, there's been a kidnapping.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.640
What buzzards or vultures
do we have in Louisiana?"

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.976
Before we address the kidnapping,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.736
I'll first address this buzzard/vulture
question I get all the time.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.176
Buzzards don't live in the United States.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.056
They are hawks that live in Europe.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.176
The big black birds you see circling
in the sky within the US are vultures.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.456
The two types of vultures
that live in Louisiana

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.240
are the turkey vulture and black vulture.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.376
To fully understand the role
of vultures in forensic science,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.480
I'll walk you through this forensic case.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.560
From the email,
certain things become apparent.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.376
We can assume the detective thinks
the individual is dead.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.840
And he wants to use the birds
to try to find the body.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.536
Like the ladies in Nashville,

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.176
the detective thinks
that vultures circling in the sky

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.720
will lead him to the body.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.960
It's not that simple.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.416
I don't know if you've ever
seen a vulture up close

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.856
or spent much time with them,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.096
but they're huge, huge.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.016
Six-foot wingspan.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.096
Vultures circle in the air

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.936
because they are too big
to flap their wings and fly,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.456
so they soar.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.536
They soar in thermals,
which are vortexes or little tornadoes

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.136
caused by pressure differences in the air

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.416
that form throughout the day
as the sun heats up the ground.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.976
Therefore, when you see
a circling vulture,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.376
the bird is usually traveling
from point A to B,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.760
rather than circling above something dead.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.016
Actually, if you want to use a vulture
to try to find a body,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.096
look for a vulture in a tree
or on a fence post.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.896
Vultures are too big and slow to hunt.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.056
So they have to scavenge.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.936
In fact, vultures are
the only animals in the world

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.416
that depend upon death as a food source.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.696
The turkey vulture
that you see here is super cool,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.776
because it's one of the few bird species
that can actually smell.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.576
It hones in on the deceased
by sensing a chemical

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.280
that's coming off the body during decay.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.496
The evolutionary role of the vulture

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.320
is to rid the earth of harmful toxins
produced following death.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.576
Once death has been detected,

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.560
the turkey vulture lands
and quickly scavenges.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.136
Vultures usually remove the eyes first,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.736
then tear the skin,

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.160
start pulling the tissues,
and leave you with a skeleton.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.216
Therefore, the importance
of vultures is not in the air,

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.440
but on the ground.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.240
Vulture scavenging is somewhat gruesome.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.976
If you're ever on a bad first date,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.576
just reference this talk,

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.456
and I don't think you'll have to worry

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.016
about your potential suitor
giving you another call.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.416
(Laughter)

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.496
Although gruesome,
vultures are key forensic players,

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.760
and here's why.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.896
Vultures will consume a dead human

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.256
just like they will consume roadkill.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.136
But you don't ever hear about that,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.216
and it's because vultures
are so good at what they do.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.096
If vultures depend on death for survival
and if they scavenge humans,

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.760
then how can vultures be absent from
forensic textbooks and training manuals?

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.096
The answer:

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.216
the tradition has been for researchers
to exclude animal scavengers

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.496
from decomposition studies

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.216
by placing a cage
over the decaying subject matter.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.656
Why?

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.576
Because researchers were afraid an animal
would run away with their subject matter

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.746
and they wouldn't have
any data to report --

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.416
consequently excluding animals' results
in a lengthy skeletonization process,

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.120
and this information is currently
what detectives use during investigations.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.216
A lot of times at a crime scene
when people see a skeletonized body,

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.536
they think, "Wow, this has been here
for a really long time undiscovered."

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.240
Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.616
Vultures accelerate decay.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.856
And the skeletonized body
could have been there

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.096
for as little as five days
if scavenged by vultures.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.976
The failure to account
for vulture scavenging

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.736
can result in forensic scientists
inaccurately estimating

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.976
how long someone has been dead

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.880
and then searching through the wrong
missing person's files.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.616
Therefore, the goal is to get forensic
scientists to focus on vulture evidence

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.776
and to get law enforcement
to consider vulture scavenging

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.800
and a possible recent death
when skeletal remains are found.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.496
Let's get back to the importance
of the kidnapping case.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.936
I responded to the detectives

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.336
and told them that vultures
like areas with water.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.256
They like areas with white-tailed deer,

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.376
they typically arrive within
the first five days following death,

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.160
they're going to leave
an intact spinal column and feathers.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.936
The detectives write back and say,

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.400
"We found the body buried
in a shallow grave.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.320
We also found the feathers you mentioned."

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.336
But there appeared to be a problem

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.856
because the feathers were located
40 yards from where the body was found.

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.376
The feathers were next
to a bloody pine cone.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.616
Vultures aren't attracted to blood,
and they typically don't wander.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.776
They might wander 40 feet,
but they're not going to wander 40 yards.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.496
That would be a waste of energy

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.000
for a bird that doesn't know
when it will get its next meal.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.056
So my first job here was to determine
if vultures were at the scene.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.920
Indeed, the feather by the pine cone
was consistent with the turkey vulture.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.880
So why in the world
would a vulture wander 40 yards?

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.376
One of the reasons I love vultures

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.416
is because they tend
to operate in a manner

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.576
that can be explained
by biology and physics.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.656
I started mentally going through
the numerous bating experiments

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.800
I had conducted at a body farm in Texas.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.776
A body farm is a place
where you can donate your body to science.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.080
I also went through
my experiences with trapping

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.920
and GPS tagging vultures.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.216
And then the year-long process
of monitoring vultures

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.760
via remote GPS technology.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.720
Next, I brought up my field notes
and had an "Aha!" moment.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.880
I knew of two things that would
lure a vulture 40 yards from a body.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.760
Guts and brain matter.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.936
I presented this information
to the detectives

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.056
and learned that they suspected
the victim had been incapacitated

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.096
by blunt force trauma to the head.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.456
The blow to the head
was thought to have occurred

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.496
in the area where the pine cone was found,

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:09.080
and then the victim was drug 40 yards
and buried in a shallow grave.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.696
This suggested that brain matter
was the lure for the vulture

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.016
and illustrates how
studying vulture behavior

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.640
can help piece together
some of the evidence.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.760
The detectives also sent me this photo.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.360
The victim's arm is sticking up
out of the grave.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.936
As a forensic scientist,
you have to think about the whole picture.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:36.640
The feather by the pine cone
indicated that vultures were at the scene.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.776
This crime scene photo also depicts

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.176
characteristic vulture
scavenging behavior.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.496
We zoom in, we see a white down feather,

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.760
which is characteristic
of the turkey vulture.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.736
Also note that the skin
has a cut-like tear near the wrist.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.136
The turkey vulture
smells the decay, lands.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.016
It can get through the pine needles,

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.296
pull out the hand,

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.816
it's going to tear the skin with its beak

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.696
and then start pulling
the soft tissues away from the bone.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.280
Just tear and pull,
tear and pull, tear and pull.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.376
This photo illustrates
the scavenging efficiency of vultures.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.416
This is important because it helps
support the time line

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.840
the detectives are putting
together for the murder.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.336
There's not a whole lot of evidence.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.776
You're not likely going to see
the vultures at the crime scene.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.280
Instead, vultures just leave
these very subtle clues.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.336
Rather than looking for the vulture,

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.216
look for the feathers and pristine bones.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.496
Vultures are important

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:42.136
because they are so good
and fast at what they do.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.816
They're like tornadoes.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.200
If you blink, you will miss them.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.640
I provided my opinion about
the vulture evidence to the detective.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.400
And he presented
the vulture evidence in court.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.200
The kidnapping case
was a death penalty case.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.680
And the defendant was found guilty.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.216
This case illustrates
how studying vulture behavior

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.880
helps innovate forensic science.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:11.456
Someone who has been murdered

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.640
deserves the most thorough
investigation possible.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.576
When we include vultures
in forensic studies,

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.256
we paint a more thorough picture
of what happened, when it happened

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.600
and who it happened to.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.016
So, the next time you're
at a crime scene with a dead body --

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.776
(Laughter)

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.776
look to the ground
to find the clues vultures have left.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.136
And if anyone ever
brings up vultures on a date,

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.336
you'll know they're a keeper.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.576
Thank you.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.280
(Applause)
