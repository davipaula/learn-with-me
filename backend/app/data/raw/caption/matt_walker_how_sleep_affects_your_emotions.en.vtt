00:00:00.182 --> 00:00:05.039
So exactly, how does a lack of sleep
impact our emotional brain?

00:00:05.063 --> 00:00:06.936
Why does that lack of sleep make us

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.147
so emotionally irrational
and hyperreactive?

00:00:11.608 --> 00:00:13.726
[Sleeping with Science]

00:00:16.192 --> 00:00:19.854
Well, several years ago,
we conducted a brain imaging study.

00:00:19.878 --> 00:00:22.422
And we took a group of healthy adults.

00:00:22.446 --> 00:00:24.971
And we either gave them
a full night of sleep

00:00:24.995 --> 00:00:26.836
or we sleep-deprived them.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.915
And then the next day,
we placed them inside an MRI scanner,

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.568
and we looked at how
their emotional brain was reacting.

00:00:34.978 --> 00:00:38.138
And we focused on one
structure in particular,

00:00:38.162 --> 00:00:39.859
it's called the amygdala.

00:00:39.883 --> 00:00:43.408
And the amygdala is one
of the centerpiece regions

00:00:43.432 --> 00:00:47.479
for the generation
of strong emotional reactions,

00:00:47.503 --> 00:00:50.479
including negative emotional reactions.

00:00:50.503 --> 00:00:54.344
Now when we looked at those people
who had had a full night of sleep,

00:00:54.368 --> 00:00:59.206
what we saw was a nice,
appropriate moderate degree

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.525
of reactivity from the amygdala.

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:04.356
It wasn't as though
there was no response at all,

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.626
but it was an appropriate response.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.351
Yet in those people
who were sleep-deprived,

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:14.491
that deep emotional brain center
was in fact, hyperactive.

00:01:14.515 --> 00:01:19.451
Indeed, the amygdala
was almost 60 percent more responsive

00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:22.076
under conditions of a lack of sleep.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.158
But why was that the case?

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.452
And what we went on to discover,

00:01:26.476 --> 00:01:29.644
is that there's another
brain region that's involved.

00:01:30.035 --> 00:01:33.744
This brain region is called
the prefrontal cortex,

00:01:33.768 --> 00:01:36.402
and it sits directly above your eyes.

00:01:36.426 --> 00:01:38.712
And you can think
of the prefrontal cortex

00:01:38.736 --> 00:01:41.711
almost like the CEO of your brain.

00:01:41.735 --> 00:01:45.489
It's very good at making
high-level, executive, top-down

00:01:45.513 --> 00:01:48.475
control decisions and reactions.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.479
In fact, it's one of the most
evolved regions of our brain.

00:01:52.806 --> 00:01:56.381
And one of the parts
of the brain that it controls

00:01:56.405 --> 00:01:59.452
is this deep emotional
center, the amygdala.

00:01:59.848 --> 00:02:03.095
Now in those people
who had had a full night of sleep,

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.419
there was a nice, strong
communication and connection

00:02:06.443 --> 00:02:08.348
between the prefrontal cortex,

00:02:08.372 --> 00:02:11.521
regulating that deep
emotional brain center.

00:02:11.545 --> 00:02:14.206
But in those people
who were sleep-deprived,

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.276
that communication, that connection
between the prefrontal cortex

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.371
and that deep amygdala
emotional brain center

00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:23.260
had essentially been severed.

00:02:23.284 --> 00:02:24.641
And as a consequence,

00:02:24.665 --> 00:02:28.116
the amygdala was responding
far more reactively

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.546
due to a lack of sleep.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.919
It's almost as though without sleep

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:35.649
we become all emotional accelerator pedal,

00:02:35.673 --> 00:02:39.217
and too little regulatory control brake.

00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:43.384
And that seems to be the reason
that we become so unbuckled

00:02:43.408 --> 00:02:46.289
in terms of our emotional integrity

00:02:46.313 --> 00:02:48.431
when we haven't been sleeping well.

00:02:48.455 --> 00:02:50.601
So that's the bad that can happen

00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:53.401
if I take sleep away from you.

00:02:53.425 --> 00:02:54.770
But it turns out

00:02:54.794 --> 00:02:56.876
that there's something good that happens

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.180
when you get your sleep back.

00:02:59.204 --> 00:03:02.443
And sleep, particularly
rapid eye movement sleep,

00:03:02.467 --> 00:03:06.530
actually offers a form
of emotional first aid.

00:03:06.887 --> 00:03:09.356
Because it's during sleep at night

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.617
that we take these difficult
emotional experiences

00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:14.829
that we've been having during the day,

00:03:14.853 --> 00:03:18.911
and that sleep acts almost
like a nocturnal soothing balm,

00:03:18.935 --> 00:03:23.274
taking the sharp edges off
those difficult experiences.

00:03:23.605 --> 00:03:28.646
And so perhaps it's not time
that heals all wounds,

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:35.031
it's time during sleep that provides
that form of emotional convalescence.

00:03:35.055 --> 00:03:37.183
So that when we come back the next day,

00:03:37.207 --> 00:03:40.160
we're able to cope
with those emotional memories.
