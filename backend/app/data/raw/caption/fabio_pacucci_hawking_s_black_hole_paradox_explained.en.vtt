00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:10.426
Scientists work on the boundaries of 
the unknown,

00:00:10.426 --> 00:00:15.696
where every new piece of knowledge 
forms a path into a void of uncertainty.

00:00:15.696 --> 00:00:17.926
And nothing is more uncertain–

00:00:17.926 --> 00:00:21.286
or potentially enlightening– 
than a paradox.

00:00:21.286 --> 00:00:22.376
Throughout history,

00:00:22.376 --> 00:00:26.086
paradoxes have threatened to 
undermine everything we know,

00:00:26.086 --> 00:00:30.696
and just as often, they’ve reshaped our 
understanding of the world.

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.399
Today, one of the biggest paradoxes in 
the universe

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.889
threatens to unravel the fields of general
relativity and quantum mechanics:

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:43.099
the black hole information paradox.

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:44.939
To understand this paradox,

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:48.439
we first need to define what we mean
by "information."

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:52.739
Typically, the information we talk about 
is visible to the naked eye.

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.559
For example,

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.589
this kind of information tells us that 
an apple is red, round, and shiny.

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.979
But physicists are more concerned with 
quantum information.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:07.929
This refers to the quantum properties of 
all the particles that make up that apple,

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:11.115
such as their position, velocity and spin.

00:01:11.115 --> 00:01:13.795
Every object in the universe is composed

00:01:13.795 --> 00:01:17.785
of particles with unique 
quantum properties.

00:01:17.785 --> 00:01:23.065
This idea is evoked most significantly 
in a vital law of physics:

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:28.169
the total amount of quantum information
in the Universe must be conserved.

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:31.436
Even if you destroy an object beyond 
recognition,

00:01:31.436 --> 00:01:35.226
its quantum information is never 
permanently deleted.

00:01:35.226 --> 00:01:38.276
And theoretically, knowledge of that 
information

00:01:38.276 --> 00:01:42.566
would allow us to recreate the object 
from its particle components.

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:46.153
Conservation of information isn’t just an 
arbitrary rule,

00:01:46.153 --> 00:01:50.943
but a mathematical necessity, upon which 
much of modern science is built.

00:01:50.943 --> 00:01:55.517
But around black holes, 
those foundations get shaken.

00:01:55.517 --> 00:01:57.835
When an apple enters a black hole,

00:01:57.835 --> 00:02:00.315
it seems as though it leaves the universe,

00:02:00.315 --> 00:02:04.325
and all its quantum information 
becomes irretrievably lost.

00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:08.245
However, this doesn’t immediately 
break the laws of physics.

00:02:08.245 --> 00:02:10.375
The information is out of sight,

00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:14.615
but it might still exist within the 
black hole’s mysterious void.

00:02:14.615 --> 00:02:17.292
Alternatively, some theories suggest

00:02:17.292 --> 00:02:21.292
that information doesn’t even make it
inside the black hole at all.

00:02:21.292 --> 00:02:24.782
Seen from outside, it’s as if the apple’s 
quantum information

00:02:24.782 --> 00:02:30.292
is encoded on the surface layer of the
black hole, called the event horizon.

00:02:30.292 --> 00:02:32.532
As the black hole’s mass increases,

00:02:32.532 --> 00:02:35.822
the surface of the event horizon 
increases as well.

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:39.362
So it’s possible that as a black hole 
swallows an object,

00:02:39.362 --> 00:02:44.099
it also grows large enough to conserve
the object’s quantum information.

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.019
But whether information is conserved 
inside the black hole or on its surface,

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.884
the laws of physics remain intact–

00:02:51.884 --> 00:02:55.404
until you account for Hawking Radiation.

00:02:55.404 --> 00:02:58.614
Discovered by Stephen Hawking in 1974,

00:02:58.614 --> 00:03:03.024
this phenomenon shows that black 
holes are gradually evaporating.

00:03:03.024 --> 00:03:05.494
Over incredibly long periods of time

00:03:05.494 --> 00:03:10.794
black holes lose mass as they shed 
particles away from their event horizons.

00:03:10.794 --> 00:03:14.064
Critically, it seems as though the 
evaporating particles

00:03:14.064 --> 00:03:17.704
are unrelated to the information 
the black hole encodes–

00:03:17.704 --> 00:03:22.244
suggesting that a black hole and all the
quantum information it contains

00:03:22.244 --> 00:03:25.124
could be completely erased.

00:03:25.124 --> 00:03:28.124
Does that quantum information 
truly disappear?

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:30.454
If not, where does it go?

00:03:30.454 --> 00:03:34.154
While the evaporation process 
would take an incredibly long time,

00:03:34.154 --> 00:03:38.084
the questions it raises for physics 
are far more urgent.

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:39.664
The destruction of information

00:03:39.664 --> 00:03:44.254
would force us to rewrite some of our most
fundamental scientific paradigms.

00:03:44.254 --> 00:03:46.304
But fortunately, in science,

00:03:46.304 --> 00:03:51.054
every paradox is an opportunity 
for new discoveries.

00:03:51.054 --> 00:03:54.939
Researchers are investigating a broad 
range of possible solutions

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:56.774
to the Information Paradox.

00:03:56.774 --> 00:03:58.064
Some have theorized

00:03:58.064 --> 00:04:02.024
that information actually is encoded 
in the escaping radiation,

00:04:02.024 --> 00:04:04.924
in some way we can’t yet understand.

00:04:04.924 --> 00:04:08.514
Others have suggested the paradox is 
just a misunderstanding

00:04:08.524 --> 00:04:12.594
of how general relativity and 
quantum field theory interact.

00:04:12.594 --> 00:04:13.504
Respectively,

00:04:13.504 --> 00:04:18.314
these two theories describe the largest
and smallest physical phenomena,

00:04:18.314 --> 00:04:20.944
and they’re notoriously 
difficult to combine.

00:04:20.944 --> 00:04:25.314
Some researchers argue that a solution
to this and many other paradoxes

00:04:25.314 --> 00:04:29.081
will come naturally with a “unified 
theory of everything.”

00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:33.801
But perhaps the most mind-bending 
theory to come from exploring this paradox

00:04:33.801 --> 00:04:36.041
is the holographic principle.

00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:39.881
Expanding on the idea that the 2D 
surface of an event horizon

00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:41.751
can store quantum information,

00:04:41.751 --> 00:04:46.551
this principle suggests that the very 
boundary of the observable universe

00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:50.550
is also a 2D surface encoded 
with information

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.440
about real, 3D objects.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.350
If this is true, it’s possible that 
reality as we know it

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.380
is just a holographic 
projection of that information.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.830
If proven, any of these theories would 
open up new questions to explore,

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.090
while still preserving our current 
models of the universe.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.280
But it’s also possible that those 
models are wrong!

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.636
Either way, this paradox has already 
helped us take another step

00:05:16.636 --> 00:05:18.226
into the unknown.
