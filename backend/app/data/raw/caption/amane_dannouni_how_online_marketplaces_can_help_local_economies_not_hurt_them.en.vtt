00:00:13.698 --> 00:00:18.152
In February 2013,
my wife and I moved to Singapore.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.230
Exactly at the same time,

00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:23.512
Uber has announced
it started operations in the country.

00:00:23.536 --> 00:00:27.432
Now, my wife and I
agree on a lot of things,

00:00:27.456 --> 00:00:30.718
but using Uber was definitely
not one of them.

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:33.823
While I was excited about the technology

00:00:33.847 --> 00:00:37.093
and how maybe we don't need
to own cars anymore,

00:00:37.117 --> 00:00:42.618
she felt that every Uber car
is here to steal jobs from taxi drivers.

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.585
And Sarah was not the only one.

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.891
As the Ubers, Airbnbs
and Amazons of the world --

00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:53.299
what we call "online marketplaces" --

00:00:53.323 --> 00:00:56.720
as they started expanding their presence,

00:00:56.744 --> 00:01:00.029
we have heard, all of us,
countless policymakers

00:01:00.053 --> 00:01:02.720
worried about how to deal
with these new risks

00:01:02.744 --> 00:01:06.609
of job destruction, lower wages
and tax leakage.

00:01:07.244 --> 00:01:09.527
We've also heard company leaders

00:01:09.551 --> 00:01:12.892
worried about aggressive competition
from global platforms

00:01:12.916 --> 00:01:15.116
eating up their local businesses.

00:01:16.067 --> 00:01:19.146
And on the rational level,
of course I understand.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.553
After all, this is basic
supply and demand economics.

00:01:22.577 --> 00:01:25.458
If, in any market,
you dramatically increase supply,

00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:28.961
you should expect prices, profitability
and growth to go down

00:01:28.985 --> 00:01:30.385
for existing players.

00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:33.466
But in my personal experience,

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.591
I've also seen
the other side of the story.

00:01:36.615 --> 00:01:38.148
Where online marketplaces,

00:01:38.172 --> 00:01:41.861
like Gojek in Indonesia
or Jumia in Africa,

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:45.860
have helped their business ecosystems
and the communities around them.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.895
The positive side I have seen

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:52.697
demonstrated itself in a woman,
a taxi driver in Egypt,

00:01:52.721 --> 00:01:54.776
that now had the opportunity to work

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.577
without the harassment
she faced in the taxi business.

00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:02.662
It demonstrated itself
through a village in Kenya

00:02:02.686 --> 00:02:04.347
that got an economic boost,

00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:07.649
because the nearby beautiful
but completely unknown lake

00:02:07.673 --> 00:02:10.749
is now becoming
a national ecotourism spot.

00:02:12.276 --> 00:02:15.323
Online marketplaces will continue to grow.

00:02:15.347 --> 00:02:17.276
And they will transform the way we shop,

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.482
the way we travel

00:02:18.506 --> 00:02:20.537
and the way we transact with each other.

00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:23.371
So we really need to understand

00:02:23.395 --> 00:02:26.347
where is the truth
between those two stories.

00:02:26.736 --> 00:02:29.688
Should we expect more of the bright side

00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:31.978
or more of the dark and worrying side?

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:36.235
And is there a way to get
the first without getting the second?

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:38.106
I believe there is.

00:02:38.514 --> 00:02:42.045
As a strategy consultant,
I study businesses for a living.

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.752
And as a mathematician at heart,

00:02:43.776 --> 00:02:46.982
I couldn't live with something
and its opposite being equally true.

00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:51.315
So, I went back to fundamentals,
and I asked the question:

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:54.505
What do online marketplaces really do?

00:02:54.903 --> 00:02:56.053
What do they do?

00:02:57.347 --> 00:02:59.164
Well, at their core,

00:02:59.188 --> 00:03:01.269
they're doing something very simple.

00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:03.583
They match sellers and buyers.

00:03:04.044 --> 00:03:05.194
That's it.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.996
For drivers and passengers,

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.403
you get Uber, Grab in Southeast Asia

00:03:10.427 --> 00:03:11.955
or DiDi in China.

00:03:12.688 --> 00:03:14.874
For matching merchants and consumers,

00:03:14.898 --> 00:03:17.903
you get Amazon, Alibaba
or Jumia in Africa.

00:03:17.927 --> 00:03:20.244
And for housing, you get Airbnb;

00:03:20.268 --> 00:03:22.410
for fundraising, you get Kickstarter --

00:03:22.434 --> 00:03:23.584
the list goes on.

00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:26.887
What all these examples have in common

00:03:26.911 --> 00:03:29.450
is that they transition
this basic functionality

00:03:29.474 --> 00:03:31.125
of matching sellers and buyers

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:34.196
from the physical world
to the digital world.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.133
And by doing so,

00:03:36.157 --> 00:03:37.968
they can find better matches,

00:03:37.992 --> 00:03:39.156
do it faster

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.196
and ultimately, unlock
more value for everyone.

00:03:43.847 --> 00:03:47.307
In fact, online marketplaces' core benefit

00:03:47.331 --> 00:03:51.013
is that they get us more
from the same amount of effort.

00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:53.537
For example,

00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:55.934
if you're a taxi driver in San Francisco

00:03:55.958 --> 00:03:58.568
and you decide to work 10 hours per day,

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.664
then you're actually having
a paying passenger in your car

00:04:02.688 --> 00:04:04.622
for four hours out of the 10.

00:04:05.168 --> 00:04:09.287
If you take the same car
and put it on a platform like Uber,

00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:11.209
you can have paying passengers

00:04:11.233 --> 00:04:13.422
for an additional one and a half hours.

00:04:13.446 --> 00:04:17.752
This is the same car
becoming 40 percent more productive.

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:22.164
And the same has been proven true
for other online marketplaces.

00:04:22.188 --> 00:04:26.156
By design, they create
more value for the economy.

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:32.363
Now, we need to figure out
who gets this additional value.

00:04:32.895 --> 00:04:34.808
You can give it to the drivers --

00:04:34.832 --> 00:04:36.720
more passengers, more income.

00:04:36.744 --> 00:04:39.760
You can give it to consumers,
if you reduce prices.

00:04:39.784 --> 00:04:42.799
Or you can decide that the platform
gets to keep all of it.

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:46.149
What usually happens
is that all three of them

00:04:46.173 --> 00:04:47.706
would somehow split it.

00:04:48.776 --> 00:04:51.212
But what about the rest of us?

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:53.517
We can also be impacted

00:04:53.541 --> 00:04:55.736
without being on either sides
of this business.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.101
If my neighbor decides
to rent his apartment on Airbnb,

00:04:59.125 --> 00:05:02.317
and we have more people
coming in and out of the building,

00:05:02.341 --> 00:05:04.023
more noise than usual,

00:05:04.047 --> 00:05:08.237
then I'm getting an unpleasant side effect
of this productivity magic.

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.149
This is what economists would call
a "negative externality."

00:05:13.173 --> 00:05:16.799
The negative externality
of Uber cars becoming more productive

00:05:16.823 --> 00:05:19.849
is taxi drivers seeing the value
of their licenses drop

00:05:19.873 --> 00:05:23.425
by as much as 30 percent
in New York, for example.

00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:25.989
This is the dark side.

00:05:26.307 --> 00:05:29.442
And this is what sparks
street demonstrations

00:05:29.466 --> 00:05:32.133
and sometimes,
sometimes, even violence.

00:05:33.323 --> 00:05:35.918
I profoundly believe this is avoidable.

00:05:35.942 --> 00:05:37.418
And it became clearer to me

00:05:37.442 --> 00:05:40.081
the more I have spent time
in emerging markets.

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:42.426
In fact, during my time in Singapore,

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.568
I spent half of any given week
traveling in the region,

00:05:45.592 --> 00:05:48.331
between Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia,

00:05:48.355 --> 00:05:49.736
and I became a user --

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.315
actually, more of a fan --

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:55.165
of online marketplaces
that were not that well-known back then.

00:05:56.047 --> 00:05:59.507
But some of them made
interesting strategic trade-offs

00:05:59.531 --> 00:06:02.024
that dramatically reduced
their side effects,

00:06:02.048 --> 00:06:03.673
their externalities.

00:06:04.871 --> 00:06:06.958
Take Gojek, for example.

00:06:07.347 --> 00:06:09.966
They're basically Uber for motor bikes.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.008
They are one of the most liked
online marketplaces in Indonesia,

00:06:15.383 --> 00:06:19.231
and this has a lot to do
with the role they chose to play.

00:06:19.637 --> 00:06:20.891
Instead of picking a fight

00:06:20.915 --> 00:06:23.613
with every other transportation
option out there,

00:06:23.637 --> 00:06:28.134
they choose to gradually integrate them
within their own platform,

00:06:28.158 --> 00:06:30.920
so that without leaving the Gojek app,

00:06:30.944 --> 00:06:33.301
you can check the public
transportation schedule

00:06:33.325 --> 00:06:35.658
and choose to take a bus
for a long distance.

00:06:35.682 --> 00:06:39.133
Then, maybe, a motorbike
or a traditional taxi

00:06:39.157 --> 00:06:43.720
that you can order and pay for
from within the same app.

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:46.523
If you look at Gojek today,

00:06:46.547 --> 00:06:49.555
nine out of 10 previous motor taxi drivers

00:06:49.579 --> 00:06:54.645
believe their quality of life has improved
after joining the platform.

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:56.979
And nine out of 10 consumers --

00:06:57.003 --> 00:06:58.408
nine out of 10 --

00:06:58.432 --> 00:07:03.685
believe that Gojek has a positive impact
on society in general.

00:07:04.403 --> 00:07:08.576
Now, this level of trust
is what allowed Gojek to grow

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.379
into what is today a super
online marketplace for everything

00:07:12.403 --> 00:07:14.561
from food to grocery

00:07:14.585 --> 00:07:17.085
even massages and laundry pickups.

00:07:18.442 --> 00:07:21.918
It all came from a deliberate trade-off

00:07:21.942 --> 00:07:24.650
to be an orchestrator
of a bigger ecosystem

00:07:24.674 --> 00:07:27.464
where others also have their role to play,

00:07:27.488 --> 00:07:29.797
instead of a single winner, a hero,

00:07:29.821 --> 00:07:33.852
that takes for himself what would,
at the end, be a smaller pie.

00:07:35.046 --> 00:07:37.482
Another interesting example is Jumia.

00:07:37.506 --> 00:07:40.744
Jumia is the equivalent
of Amazon in Africa.

00:07:40.768 --> 00:07:43.553
But they don't generate
the same level of fear

00:07:43.577 --> 00:07:45.711
in the small-business community.

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:48.141
And one of the reasons for that

00:07:48.165 --> 00:07:51.900
is because they have decided
to actively invest

00:07:51.924 --> 00:07:53.614
in African entrepreneurs,

00:07:53.638 --> 00:07:55.728
to grow them into the digital age.

00:07:56.292 --> 00:07:57.482
Now keep in mind,

00:07:57.506 --> 00:08:01.617
Jumia is operating in countries
with some of the lowest digital literacy

00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:04.172
and digital connectivity
scores in the world.

00:08:04.886 --> 00:08:06.918
Now they could have dealt with that

00:08:06.942 --> 00:08:09.529
the usual way, through
lobbying for reforms --

00:08:09.553 --> 00:08:11.426
and they probably do that --

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.534
but they have also built Jumia University,

00:08:14.558 --> 00:08:15.783
an e-learning platform

00:08:15.807 --> 00:08:19.982
where merchants can come and learn
basic digital and business skills.

00:08:21.085 --> 00:08:24.799
We have studied online marketplaces
in Africa last year.

00:08:25.141 --> 00:08:28.767
And during that study,
we have met one of Jumia's merchants.

00:08:29.085 --> 00:08:30.474
His name is Jomo.

00:08:30.498 --> 00:08:33.926
He was fired from his job in 2014,

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.466
and at that time, he decided
he wanted to become his own boss.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.204
He wanted to be independent.

00:08:39.228 --> 00:08:42.046
He also wanted to never be fired again.

00:08:43.362 --> 00:08:44.682
So at that time,

00:08:44.706 --> 00:08:47.148
Jomo had no clue what a business is.

00:08:47.172 --> 00:08:49.632
So he needed to go through
a series of trainings

00:08:49.656 --> 00:08:52.597
to learn how to select products,
how to price them

00:08:52.621 --> 00:08:54.688
and how to promote them online.

00:08:55.522 --> 00:08:59.259
Today, Jomo has a 10-employee
online business.

00:08:59.807 --> 00:09:01.783
And as of a few months ago,

00:09:01.807 --> 00:09:04.926
he just opened his very first
brick-and-mortar shop

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.684
in the suburbs of Nairobi.

00:09:07.252 --> 00:09:08.776
Now, through its university,

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.704
Jumia has the potential
of helping a huge number of Jomos.

00:09:13.373 --> 00:09:16.704
And we have estimated that together
with other online marketplaces

00:09:16.728 --> 00:09:17.886
on the continent,

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:22.663
they can generate three million
additional jobs by 2025.

00:09:24.388 --> 00:09:26.475
And they would do that either directly,

00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:28.785
or through their impact
on the wider community.

00:09:28.809 --> 00:09:29.975
And sometimes,

00:09:29.999 --> 00:09:32.756
taking that wider impact
into consideration

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.252
or forgetting about it

00:09:34.276 --> 00:09:36.209
can make or break a platform.

00:09:36.911 --> 00:09:39.919
To illustrate that,
let's go back to Singapore.

00:09:39.943 --> 00:09:44.641
So, when we decided with my wife
to leave the country last year,

00:09:44.665 --> 00:09:46.531
Uber decided to do the same.

00:09:47.117 --> 00:09:48.538
At the same time,

00:09:48.562 --> 00:09:53.111
again, we started to see that pattern,

00:09:53.135 --> 00:09:55.460
but maybe it's a coincidence.

00:09:56.053 --> 00:10:00.679
In reality, Uber lost
the ride-hailing battle

00:10:00.703 --> 00:10:03.727
to a Malaysian-born start-up called Grab.

00:10:04.616 --> 00:10:06.378
Now, interestingly,

00:10:06.402 --> 00:10:09.931
my wife didn't have the same
level of concerns with Grab,

00:10:09.955 --> 00:10:12.598
because when Grab started,
it had a different name.

00:10:12.622 --> 00:10:15.074
It was called MyTeksi,

00:10:15.098 --> 00:10:20.537
and as the name suggests,
it started as a platform for taxis.

00:10:21.521 --> 00:10:25.943
So when Grab started expanding
the driver pool beyond taxis,

00:10:25.967 --> 00:10:28.500
it was seen as gradual and reasonable.

00:10:28.815 --> 00:10:31.748
They were also very careful
while doing so.

00:10:32.188 --> 00:10:34.979
They thought of what kind
of social safety net

00:10:35.003 --> 00:10:37.125
they should bring to all drivers.

00:10:37.149 --> 00:10:40.188
So they put in place
special insurance packages

00:10:40.212 --> 00:10:42.513
and even financial education programs.

00:10:43.295 --> 00:10:48.056
Now, compare that
with what happened in London,

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.025
in New York, in Paris,

00:10:50.049 --> 00:10:53.946
where taxi drivers didn't feel
that the platforms understood

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:57.307
they had to pay 200,000 euros
for their license --

00:10:57.331 --> 00:10:58.665
and mostly in loans.

00:10:59.482 --> 00:11:03.449
When you don't take that kind
of social environmental information

00:11:03.473 --> 00:11:04.640
into account,

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:06.330
you get strong reactions.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.578
I'm not trying to argue
that the trade-offs

00:11:12.602 --> 00:11:16.465
by either Grab or Jumia
or Gojek are risk-free.

00:11:16.903 --> 00:11:20.036
Did they slow down growth
at some point, temporarily?

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.219
Maybe.

00:11:21.243 --> 00:11:22.506
But look at them today.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.428
Gojek is worth 10 billion dollars.

00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:30.918
Jumia is one of only three unicorns
in the whole of Africa.

00:11:31.752 --> 00:11:34.953
And Grab, well, they pushed out Uber

00:11:34.977 --> 00:11:37.777
out of the whole region of Southeast Asia.

00:11:38.712 --> 00:11:43.165
And I also think these trade-offs
have nothing specific to emerging markets.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:46.846
Amazon or Uber or others
can learn from them

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.880
and adapt them to their own realities.

00:11:50.443 --> 00:11:51.594
In the long run,

00:11:51.618 --> 00:11:54.335
this doesn't need to be a zero-sum game.

00:11:54.639 --> 00:11:55.790
In the long run --

00:11:55.814 --> 00:11:58.846
and this is maybe the Asian
side of me speaking --

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.623
it pays to be patient.

00:12:00.941 --> 00:12:04.522
It pays to reconsider
your goal and your priorities

00:12:04.546 --> 00:12:06.918
in the light of a much bigger equation

00:12:06.942 --> 00:12:10.307
that includes you
and your users, of course,

00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:13.311
but also it includes regulators,

00:12:13.335 --> 00:12:15.573
policymakers, your communities.

00:12:15.597 --> 00:12:17.906
And I would argue, above all,

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:21.216
it includes the very businesses
you are meant to disrupt.

00:12:21.684 --> 00:12:22.834
Thank you.

00:12:22.858 --> 00:12:26.595
(Applause)
