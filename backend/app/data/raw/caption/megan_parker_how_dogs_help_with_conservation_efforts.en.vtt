00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.020
Thank you.

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:16.933
I'm here to talk about dogs,

00:00:17.082 --> 00:00:20.092
but more specifically,
I'm here to talk about bad dogs,

00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:21.654
and why I love them.

00:00:22.884 --> 00:00:25.006
I'm a conservation biologist,

00:00:25.338 --> 00:00:29.345
meaning I study weird species
and try to count them.

00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:32.544
And I'm also a trainer of detection dogs,

00:00:32.544 --> 00:00:36.676
and where those two worlds meet
is where I live, and where I work.

00:00:36.687 --> 00:00:39.963
Most of the dogs that we get
for this kind of work,

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:42.473
we scour shelters for
because these are bad dogs,

00:00:42.483 --> 00:00:44.226
and they don't make great pets.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.173
And you know these dogs.

00:00:46.183 --> 00:00:47.913
You go to your friend's barbecue,

00:00:47.923 --> 00:00:49.773
and that dog comes up,

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:52.403
and she is so happy to see you
she pees on your feet,

00:00:52.413 --> 00:00:55.449
and she drops this big,
slabbery ball in your lap,

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:56.512
and you just throw it

00:00:56.532 --> 00:01:00.112
to try to get as much distance
between yourself and this dog as possible,

00:01:00.132 --> 00:01:04.622
and it comes back, and then
by 950th throw you're just thinking,

00:01:04.632 --> 00:01:07.022
"Oh, just why didn't they
get rid of this dog?"

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.770
And often they do.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.190
They end up in shelters

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.690
because they often have
this overwhelming desire

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.081
to bring you things.

00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:17.258
(Laughter)

00:01:17.258 --> 00:01:19.327
They think that you're
really enjoying this.

00:01:19.337 --> 00:01:22.907
The dog is so happy, thinking
that you're all enjoying this game

00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:25.862
because you're throwing something
and it's bringing it to you.

00:01:25.872 --> 00:01:28.009
And they're telling you
where this thing is,

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.054
and that's what we've asked them to do

00:01:30.054 --> 00:01:34.604
over the evolution of time,
our companionship with dogs,

00:01:34.604 --> 00:01:36.774
we've asked them to bring us stuff.

00:01:36.924 --> 00:01:38.692
And they do a great job.

00:01:38.692 --> 00:01:40.418
They bring us our livestock,

00:01:41.132 --> 00:01:43.562
and they bring us food and game,

00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:46.130
and this is the only species on the planet

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.969
that can be bothered to bring us stuff
and bothered to tell us what they know.

00:01:51.115 --> 00:01:53.785
I mean you can ask a camel or a bear,

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:56.290
or you can ask your cat,
and you get nothing.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:57.300
(Laughter)

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.273
But dogs love telling you what they know.

00:01:59.293 --> 00:02:02.119
And the ones that really
really really love this,

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:06.053
they are over the top,
they have this unbelievable energy,

00:02:06.073 --> 00:02:08.853
just unrelenting go and drive.

00:02:09.163 --> 00:02:12.808
And we categorize that often
as just a reject dog.

00:02:12.818 --> 00:02:16.182
It is just too much, it's destructive,
it's all of these things.

00:02:16.332 --> 00:02:19.262
But those are the characteristics
I like to work with in dogs.

00:02:19.282 --> 00:02:23.012
Inability to quit: it's not even a desire,
it's an inability to quit,

00:02:23.202 --> 00:02:24.712
It's what resilience is.

00:02:24.722 --> 00:02:27.441
For a dog that doesn't stop,

00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:30.351
you can train that dog
to do lots of things

00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:31.991
and bring you information.

00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:34.811
I'd like to tell you a little bit
about this particular dog,

00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:36.131
his name is Ruger.

00:02:36.328 --> 00:02:38.398
And he's a really bad dog.

00:02:38.715 --> 00:02:41.565
He is the first
anti-poaching dog in Zambia,

00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:43.361
lives right next to a national park

00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:47.281
where animals are being poached
and snared and trafficked out of the park,

00:02:47.311 --> 00:02:49.921
and even, you know, elephant ivory
from the Congo Basin

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:52.792
is moving through Tanzania
and through Zambia

00:02:52.802 --> 00:02:55.002
out to ports to be shipped abroad.

00:02:55.282 --> 00:03:00.352
And this dog is trained to find ivory
and rhino horn, bush meat,

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:04.236
other wild life contraband
and guns and ammunition.

00:03:04.236 --> 00:03:07.390
I trained him, and I found him
to be a horrible dog.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.580
He bit and snapped at people,
he was scary to approach,

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.650
he was everything you fear in a dog,

00:03:16.044 --> 00:03:18.384
and it turns out he was going blind.

00:03:18.736 --> 00:03:20.856
So I take this dog to Zambia,

00:03:21.283 --> 00:03:24.143
and I pair him with these scouts

00:03:24.143 --> 00:03:27.011
who don't have any history
of having pets or being with dogs

00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:29.292
except throwing rocks at village dogs.

00:03:29.322 --> 00:03:32.062
And they learned to think
of this dog as a colleague.

00:03:32.521 --> 00:03:36.481
And after four months
of intensive training with dogs,

00:03:37.186 --> 00:03:39.026
they started setting up roadblocks

00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:42.196
and looking for illegal contraband
being trafficked in vehicles

00:03:42.196 --> 00:03:44.516
along the roads outside this park.

00:03:44.706 --> 00:03:46.042
And they checked vehicles,

00:03:46.072 --> 00:03:49.142
and by a human doing it,
it can take hours,

00:03:49.182 --> 00:03:53.002
especially for a bus
loaded with luggage and food,

00:03:53.022 --> 00:03:55.530
like this one up in the top corner.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.533
And Ruger just checked it
in a few minutes

00:03:57.533 --> 00:04:00.383
as this is their first
practice training on a roadblock.

00:04:00.403 --> 00:04:03.845
And he alerted, which means he sat,
and he stared at his handler,

00:04:03.865 --> 00:04:06.105
and the handler was like, "Oh, dear!"

00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:09.035
They searched it, looked through it,
and they found nothing,

00:04:09.075 --> 00:04:11.369
and so their spirits dropped.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.770
But they unloaded that minivan,
and they have luggage out,

00:04:15.804 --> 00:04:18.754
and again Ruger picked
a piece of luggage and he sat,

00:04:18.765 --> 00:04:21.290
and they searched through it
and found nothing.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:25.690
And Ruger insisted, and they went back,
and then Ruger hit on a tiny matchbox

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.334
wrapped in a plastic bag inside clothes.

00:04:28.355 --> 00:04:30.725
And inside that matchbox was a primer cap,

00:04:30.745 --> 00:04:35.695
which is an illegal firing pin
for a handmade rifle.

00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:39.801
And so everyone, all the passengers
on that bus, all the scouts,

00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:41.322
they suddenly believed.

00:04:41.346 --> 00:04:44.677
They believed that Ruger knew
what he was doing because he didn't quit.

00:04:44.677 --> 00:04:46.807
He has an even more interesting backstory.

00:04:46.837 --> 00:04:50.613
He came off of an Indian reservation,
the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana.

00:04:50.797 --> 00:04:52.176
And he was a horrible puppy,

00:04:52.196 --> 00:04:55.356
and the owner of this litter
shot all of the dogs.

00:04:55.726 --> 00:04:59.201
Somehow Ruger escaped,
he ended up in a shelter in Helena.

00:04:59.481 --> 00:05:01.919
Someone found him
and noticed how bad he was

00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:05.118
and brought him to us to be trained
as a conservation detection dog.

00:05:05.118 --> 00:05:07.595
He has made a huge difference.

00:05:07.605 --> 00:05:12.485
Because of his unrelenting energy
and desire to work and love of work,

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:14.789
he brings us amazing information.

00:05:15.025 --> 00:05:17.214
Then there is another dog
I'd like you to meet.

00:05:17.214 --> 00:05:18.344
His name is Pepin,

00:05:18.368 --> 00:05:21.098
and he is with our executive,
Dr. Pete Coppolillo,

00:05:21.098 --> 00:05:23.108
who is going to tell you
a little bit more,

00:05:23.108 --> 00:05:26.477
and I'm going to work Pepin for you.

00:05:29.334 --> 00:05:31.047
PC: Well, Megan, Pepin get ready.

00:05:31.047 --> 00:05:33.031
I'll give you a little update on Ruger.

00:05:33.031 --> 00:05:36.721
The four months after he made
his first find in the minibus,

00:05:37.312 --> 00:05:42.802
he detected and the scouts he works with
confiscated 15 guns.

00:05:43.167 --> 00:05:44.817
Mostly homemade muzzleloaders,

00:05:44.847 --> 00:05:47.627
which are their gun of preference
for elephant poaching.

00:05:47.705 --> 00:05:50.567
They're also used because guns
are hard to come by in Africa,

00:05:50.577 --> 00:05:54.594
by sometimes seven, sometimes 10,
sometimes more different poachers.

00:05:54.594 --> 00:05:55.818
So, as of now,

00:05:55.838 --> 00:06:00.957
there may be 100-150 different poachers
who are out of business thanks to Ruger.

00:06:01.132 --> 00:06:04.212
(Applause) (Cheers)

00:06:05.817 --> 00:06:08.168
And for these exceptional,
really high-drive dogs,

00:06:08.168 --> 00:06:11.094
you know, Ruger is really the rule
rather than the exception.

00:06:11.114 --> 00:06:12.934
And I'll tell you about a couple more.

00:06:12.934 --> 00:06:13.952
This is Seamus.

00:06:13.952 --> 00:06:16.427
Seamus is trained to detect dyer’s woad,

00:06:16.437 --> 00:06:18.697
which is the weed
that's in that pot there.

00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:20.081
And speaking of resilience,

00:06:20.081 --> 00:06:23.881
dyer’s woad drops between 12,000
and 15,000 seeds a year.

00:06:24.252 --> 00:06:25.533
So it's a noxious weed,

00:06:25.553 --> 00:06:28.533
and when it gets established,
it's very hard to get rid of.

00:06:28.547 --> 00:06:30.842
So people were working
on getting rid of it

00:06:30.842 --> 00:06:34.942
on Mount Sentinel in Missoula
for about 10 years,

00:06:35.092 --> 00:06:36.982
and they weren't making any progress.

00:06:36.982 --> 00:06:39.357
So in 2011, we brought in Seamus.

00:06:39.467 --> 00:06:44.127
And Seamus is able to do something
that we human searchers can't,

00:06:44.153 --> 00:06:47.703
which is find it by smell
before it flowers.

00:06:47.796 --> 00:06:52.666
Seamus has knocked back dyer’s woad
by over 95 percent.

00:06:52.818 --> 00:06:57.150
Thanks to him, we're going to do something
that was unthinkable just a few years ago,

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.250
which is eradicate a noxious weed,
a bad infestation of a noxious weed.

00:07:02.267 --> 00:07:04.788
And this is Wicket.
Wicket is one of the best stories.

00:07:04.788 --> 00:07:07.288
She was in a shelter
in Anaconda, Montana,

00:07:07.308 --> 00:07:10.930
and when we came to get her,
the director of the shelter said,

00:07:10.963 --> 00:07:13.293
"You don't want that dog.
That dog is crazy."

00:07:13.313 --> 00:07:14.933
(Laughter)

00:07:14.943 --> 00:07:16.713
And now Aimee famously said,

00:07:16.723 --> 00:07:18.953
"I think she might be
the right kind of crazy."

00:07:18.973 --> 00:07:22.548
Wicket is now the most accomplished
conservation detection dog in the world.

00:07:22.548 --> 00:07:26.588
She's worked on three continents,
she's worked in dozens of US states,

00:07:26.608 --> 00:07:30.378
and here she is searching
a boat for zebra mussels

00:07:30.388 --> 00:07:34.470
which have a microscopic
larval stage that we can't see.

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:37.233
Speaking of accomplished and crazy,

00:07:37.237 --> 00:07:38.377
(Laughter)

00:07:38.402 --> 00:07:40.812
now you guys will get to watch
Pepin do his thing.

00:07:40.832 --> 00:07:42.312
So Meg's put his vest on.

00:07:42.652 --> 00:07:46.102
That is his signal that it's time to work.
You can see he's low-focused.

00:07:46.122 --> 00:07:47.162
(Laughter)

00:07:47.187 --> 00:07:48.547
He is ready to go.

00:07:49.318 --> 00:07:51.836
So I hid ivory.
I hid some ivory in the room.

00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:55.356
Pepin is one of the ivory dogs,
and I hid some ivory in the room.

00:07:55.427 --> 00:07:57.167
You, guys, just stay put.

00:07:57.633 --> 00:08:00.973
He's also not trained on narcotics,
so no one has to make a run,

00:08:00.999 --> 00:08:02.009
(Laughter)

00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:04.012
for the door or anything like that,

00:08:04.022 --> 00:08:09.742
and when Meg tells him to go,
he'll do his thing.

00:08:11.446 --> 00:08:14.286
So what you're going to see
is you're going to see him work,

00:08:14.286 --> 00:08:17.126
and you can watch his head,
he'll move his head up and down,

00:08:17.126 --> 00:08:18.383
it's a little hard indoors

00:08:18.383 --> 00:08:20.793
because there's not much air
moving around in here.

00:08:21.143 --> 00:08:24.683
But he'll search, and you may see him
whip around, change directions,

00:08:24.913 --> 00:08:27.883
his alert is something
we call "passive alert."

00:08:27.983 --> 00:08:29.054
He sits.

00:08:29.154 --> 00:08:30.456
And the reason he does that

00:08:30.456 --> 00:08:34.736
is because we have him trained
not to disturb the samples.

00:08:34.958 --> 00:08:38.068
Sometimes it's a crime scene,
so they want to collect evidence.

00:08:38.075 --> 00:08:41.775
Sometimes we collect scats for DNA
or things like that.

00:08:42.273 --> 00:08:44.145
Normally, he works in big open places.

00:08:44.153 --> 00:08:46.983
He is trained on grizzly bear,
he is trained on wolverine,

00:08:46.983 --> 00:08:49.613
so he runs on big, high
meadows and pastures,

00:08:49.622 --> 00:08:53.052
but he's also trained on containers,
vehicles and buildings.

00:08:55.332 --> 00:08:56.812
And he's checking there.

00:08:58.132 --> 00:08:59.912
You see he's got scent now.

00:09:00.238 --> 00:09:02.108
There he goes. Good job, pal!

00:09:02.552 --> 00:09:04.042
That's his alert.

00:09:05.105 --> 00:09:08.395
And she has a command that is, "Show me!"

00:09:08.415 --> 00:09:10.475
And he'll show where it is.

00:09:10.491 --> 00:09:12.721
So that's a broken ivory tusk.
