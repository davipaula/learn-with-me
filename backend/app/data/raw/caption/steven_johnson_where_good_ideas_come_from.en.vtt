00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:20.095
Fifty-two minutes ago, I took this picture
about 10 blocks from here.

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.163
This is the Grand CafÃ© here in Oxford.

00:00:23.187 --> 00:00:24.485
I took this picture

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.254
because this turns out to be
the first coffeehouse to open in England,

00:00:29.278 --> 00:00:30.437
in 1650.

00:00:30.461 --> 00:00:32.578
That's its great claim to fame.

00:00:32.602 --> 00:00:34.110
And I wanted to show it to you,

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:36.716
not because I want to give you
the Starbucks tour

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.922
of historic England --

00:00:37.946 --> 00:00:39.055
(Laughter)

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.527
but rather because
the English coffeehouse was crucial

00:00:42.551 --> 00:00:47.309
to the development and spread of one
of the great intellectual flowerings

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.099
of the last 500 years,

00:00:49.123 --> 00:00:50.928
what we now call the Enlightenment.

00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:55.504
And the coffeehouse played such a big role
in the birth of the Enlightenment

00:00:55.528 --> 00:00:58.023
in part because of what people
were drinking there.

00:00:58.047 --> 00:01:03.304
Because, before the spread
of coffee and tea through British culture,

00:01:03.328 --> 00:01:06.571
what people drank --
both elite and mass folks drank --

00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:08.968
day in and day out, from dawn until dusk,

00:01:08.992 --> 00:01:10.217
was alcohol.

00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:12.290
Alcohol was the daytime
beverage of choice.

00:01:12.314 --> 00:01:14.388
You would drink a little beer
with breakfast

00:01:14.412 --> 00:01:15.967
and have a little wine at lunch,

00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:18.289
a little gin, particularly around 1650,

00:01:18.313 --> 00:01:21.421
and top it off with a little beer and wine
at the end of the day.

00:01:21.445 --> 00:01:24.669
That was the healthy choice,
because the water wasn't safe to drink.

00:01:24.693 --> 00:01:27.786
And so, effectively,
until the rise of the coffeehouse,

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.954
you had an entire population
that was effectively drunk all day.

00:01:30.978 --> 00:01:32.174
(Laughter)

00:01:32.198 --> 00:01:35.190
And you can imagine what that would
be like in your own life --

00:01:35.214 --> 00:01:38.670
and I know this is true of some of you --
if you were drinking all day --

00:01:38.694 --> 00:01:39.725
(Laughter)

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:43.026
and then you switched from a depressant
to a stimulant in your life.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.594
You would have better ideas.

00:01:44.618 --> 00:01:46.682
You would be sharper and more alert.

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:50.069
So it's not an accident that a great
flowering of innovation happened

00:01:50.093 --> 00:01:52.261
as England switched to tea and coffee.

00:01:52.285 --> 00:01:55.094
But the other thing
that makes the coffeehouse important

00:01:55.118 --> 00:01:57.129
is the architecture of the space.

00:01:57.548 --> 00:01:59.751
It was a space where people
would get together,

00:01:59.775 --> 00:02:02.514
from different backgrounds,
different fields of expertise,

00:02:02.538 --> 00:02:03.699
and share.

00:02:03.723 --> 00:02:07.126
It was a space, as Matt Ridley talked
about, where ideas could have sex.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.631
This was their conjugal bed, in a sense;
ideas would get together there.

00:02:10.655 --> 00:02:13.347
And an astonishing number
of innovations from this period

00:02:13.371 --> 00:02:16.525
have a coffeehouse
somewhere in their story.

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:19.850
I've been spending a lot of time
thinking about coffeehouses

00:02:19.874 --> 00:02:21.063
for the last five years

00:02:21.087 --> 00:02:24.045
because I've been kind of on this quest

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.787
to investigate this question
of where good ideas come from.

00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:33.063
What are the environments
that lead to unusual levels of innovation,

00:02:33.087 --> 00:02:35.392
unusual levels of creativity?

00:02:35.416 --> 00:02:39.143
What's the kind of environmental --
what is the space of creativity?

00:02:39.777 --> 00:02:41.602
And what I've done is,

00:02:41.626 --> 00:02:44.169
I've looked at both environments
like the coffeehouse,

00:02:44.193 --> 00:02:46.919
I've looked at media environments
like the World Wide Web,

00:02:46.943 --> 00:02:48.951
that have been extraordinarily innovative;

00:02:48.975 --> 00:02:51.376
I've gone back to the history
of the first cities;

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.020
I've even gone to biological environments,
like coral reefs and rain forests,

00:02:55.044 --> 00:02:57.615
that involve unusual levels
of biological innovation.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.527
And what I've been looking for
is shared patterns,

00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:04.010
signature behavior
that shows up again and again

00:03:04.034 --> 00:03:05.435
in all of these environments.

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.091
Are there recurring patterns
that we can learn from,

00:03:08.115 --> 00:03:10.593
that we can take
and apply to our own lives

00:03:10.617 --> 00:03:13.022
or our own organizations
or our own environments

00:03:13.046 --> 00:03:15.054
to make them more creative and innovative?

00:03:15.078 --> 00:03:16.511
And I think I've found a few.

00:03:16.535 --> 00:03:19.299
But what you have to do
to make sense of this

00:03:19.323 --> 00:03:21.636
and to really understand
these principles is,

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.891
you have to do away with

00:03:23.915 --> 00:03:27.041
the way in which our conventional
metaphors and language steers us

00:03:27.065 --> 00:03:30.332
towards certain concepts of idea creation.

00:03:30.356 --> 00:03:35.098
We have this very rich vocabulary
to describe moments of inspiration.

00:03:35.122 --> 00:03:37.568
We have the "flash" of insight,

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:39.102
the "stroke" of insight,

00:03:39.126 --> 00:03:40.812
we have "epiphanies,"

00:03:40.836 --> 00:03:42.547
we have eureka moments,

00:03:42.571 --> 00:03:44.585
we have the "light bulb" moments, right?

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.599
All of these concepts,
as rhetorically florid as they are,

00:03:49.623 --> 00:03:50.980
share this basic assumption,

00:03:51.004 --> 00:03:53.508
which is that an idea is a single thing.

00:03:54.021 --> 00:03:59.576
It's something that happens often
in a wonderful, illuminating moment.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.024
But, in fact, what I would argue
and what you really need to begin with

00:04:03.048 --> 00:04:07.426
is this idea that an idea is a network
on the most elemental level.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.960
I mean, this is what is happening
inside your brain.

00:04:09.984 --> 00:04:12.522
An idea -- a new idea --
is a new network of neurons

00:04:12.546 --> 00:04:14.886
firing in sync with each other
inside your brain.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.154
It's a new configuration
that has never formed before.

00:04:18.178 --> 00:04:21.381
And the question is: How do you
get your brain into environments

00:04:21.405 --> 00:04:24.282
where these new networks
are going to be more likely to form?

00:04:24.306 --> 00:04:27.983
And it turns out that, in fact,
the network patterns of the outside world

00:04:28.007 --> 00:04:32.179
mimic a lot of the network patterns
of the internal world of a human brain.

00:04:32.203 --> 00:04:35.168
So the metaphor I'd like to use,

00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:39.615
I can take from a story
of a great idea that's quite recent --

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:42.228
a lot more recent than the 1650s.

00:04:43.461 --> 00:04:45.501
A wonderful guy named Timothy Prestero

00:04:45.525 --> 00:04:48.156
has an organization
called Design That Matters.

00:04:48.636 --> 00:04:52.230
They decided to tackle
this really pressing problem

00:04:52.254 --> 00:04:55.786
of the terrible problems
we have with infant mortality rates

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.667
in the developing world.

00:04:57.691 --> 00:05:00.140
One of the things
that's very frustrating about this

00:05:00.164 --> 00:05:05.541
is that we know by getting modern
neonatal incubators into any context,

00:05:05.565 --> 00:05:08.868
if we can keep premature babies warm,
basically -- it's very simple --

00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:11.635
we can halve infant mortality rates
in those environments.

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:13.452
So the technology is there.

00:05:13.476 --> 00:05:16.287
These are standard
in all the industrialized worlds.

00:05:16.311 --> 00:05:19.746
The problem is, if you buy
a $40,000 incubator,

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.149
and you send it off
to a midsized village in Africa,

00:05:23.173 --> 00:05:25.684
it will work great
for a year or two years,

00:05:25.708 --> 00:05:28.137
and then something
will go wrong and it will break,

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.297
and it will remain broken forever,

00:05:30.321 --> 00:05:33.058
because you don't have
a whole system of spare parts,

00:05:33.082 --> 00:05:35.249
and you don't have
the on-the-ground expertise

00:05:35.273 --> 00:05:37.716
to fix this $40,000 piece of equipment.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.788
So you end up having this problem
where you spend all this money

00:05:40.812 --> 00:05:43.945
getting aid and all these advanced
electronics to these countries,

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:45.369
and it ends up being useless.

00:05:45.393 --> 00:05:47.410
So what Prestero
and his team decided to do

00:05:47.434 --> 00:05:50.209
was to look around and see:
What are the abundant resources

00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:51.933
in these developing world contexts?

00:05:51.957 --> 00:05:53.222
And what they noticed was,

00:05:53.246 --> 00:05:56.460
they don't have a lot of DVRs,
they don't have a lot of microwaves,

00:05:56.484 --> 00:05:59.885
but they seem to do a pretty good job
of keeping their cars on the road.

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:03.190
There's a Toyota 4Runner
on the street in all these places.

00:06:03.214 --> 00:06:06.545
They seem to have the expertise
to keep cars working.

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:07.854
So they started to think,

00:06:07.878 --> 00:06:10.786
"Could we build a neonatal incubator

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.361
that's built entirely
out of automobile parts?"

00:06:13.988 --> 00:06:15.717
And this is what they came up with.

00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:17.380
It's called the NeoNurture device.

00:06:17.404 --> 00:06:19.897
From the outside,
it looks like a normal little thing

00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:22.082
you'd find in a modern Western hospital.

00:06:22.106 --> 00:06:23.739
In the inside, it's all car parts.

00:06:23.763 --> 00:06:25.981
It's got a fan, it's got
headlights for warmth,

00:06:26.005 --> 00:06:27.624
it's got door chimes for alarm,

00:06:27.648 --> 00:06:29.314
it runs off a car battery.

00:06:29.338 --> 00:06:32.325
And so all you need
is the spare parts from your Toyota

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:34.057
and the ability to fix a headlight,

00:06:34.081 --> 00:06:35.590
and you can repair this thing.

00:06:35.614 --> 00:06:36.766
Now that's a great idea,

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.456
but I'd like to say that, in fact,

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.836
this is a great metaphor
for the way ideas happen.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.222
We like to think our breakthrough
ideas, you know,

00:06:43.246 --> 00:06:45.270
are like that $40,000,
brand-new incubator,

00:06:45.294 --> 00:06:46.639
state-of-the-art technology.

00:06:46.663 --> 00:06:48.954
But more often than not,
they're cobbled together

00:06:48.978 --> 00:06:51.425
from whatever parts
that happen to be around nearby.

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:52.980
We take ideas from other people,

00:06:53.004 --> 00:06:56.069
people we've learned from,
people we run into in the coffee shop,

00:06:56.093 --> 00:06:59.432
and we stitch them together into new forms
and we create something new.

00:06:59.456 --> 00:07:01.327
That's really where innovation happens.

00:07:01.351 --> 00:07:03.747
And that means we have to change
some of our models

00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:06.698
of what innovation and deep thinking
really looks like, right?

00:07:06.722 --> 00:07:08.316
I mean, this is one vision of it.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.913
Another is Newton and the apple,
when Newton was at Cambridge.

00:07:11.937 --> 00:07:13.420
This is a statue from Oxford.

00:07:13.444 --> 00:07:16.123
You know, you're sitting there,
thinking a deep thought,

00:07:16.147 --> 00:07:19.339
the apple falls from the tree,
and you have the theory of gravity.

00:07:19.363 --> 00:07:23.377
In fact, the spaces that have historically
led to innovation tend to look like this.

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:27.011
This is Hogarth's famous painting
of a kind of political dinner at a tavern,

00:07:27.035 --> 00:07:29.667
but this is what the coffee shops
looked like back then.

00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:33.630
This is the kind of chaotic environment
where ideas were likely to come together,

00:07:33.654 --> 00:07:37.263
where people were likely to have new,
interesting, unpredictable collisions,

00:07:37.287 --> 00:07:38.908
people from different backgrounds.

00:07:38.932 --> 00:07:42.095
So if we're trying to build organizations
that are more innovative,

00:07:42.119 --> 00:07:45.609
we have to build spaces that, strangely
enough, look a bit more like this.

00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:49.040
This is what your office should look like,
it's part of my message here.

00:07:49.064 --> 00:07:52.471
And one of the problems with this is that,
when you research this field,

00:07:52.495 --> 00:07:54.583
people are notoriously unreliable

00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:58.000
when they actually self-report
on where they have their own good ideas,

00:07:58.024 --> 00:08:00.744
or their history of their best ideas.

00:08:00.768 --> 00:08:04.103
And a few years ago, a wonderful
researcher named Kevin Dunbar

00:08:04.127 --> 00:08:07.760
decided to go around
and basically do the Big Brother approach

00:08:07.784 --> 00:08:09.788
to figuring out
where good ideas come from.

00:08:09.812 --> 00:08:12.250
He went to a bunch
of science labs around the world

00:08:12.274 --> 00:08:15.906
and videotaped everyone as they were
doing every little bit of their job:

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.287
when they were sitting
in front of the microscope,

00:08:18.311 --> 00:08:21.115
when they were talking to colleagues
at the watercooler ...

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:23.021
And he recorded all these conversations

00:08:23.045 --> 00:08:26.161
and tried to figure out where
the most important ideas happened.

00:08:26.185 --> 00:08:29.496
And when we think about the classic
image of the scientist in the lab,

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.707
we have this image -- you know,
they're poring over the microscope,

00:08:32.731 --> 00:08:34.806
and they see something
in the tissue sample,

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.937
and -- "Eureka!" -- they've got the idea.

00:08:36.961 --> 00:08:40.270
What happened, actually,
when Dunbar looked at the tape,

00:08:40.294 --> 00:08:43.532
is that, in fact, almost all
of the important breakthrough ideas

00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:46.651
did not happen alone in the lab,
in front of the microscope.

00:08:46.675 --> 00:08:50.032
They happened at the conference table
at the weekly lab meeting,

00:08:50.056 --> 00:08:53.679
when everybody got together
and shared their latest data and findings,

00:08:53.703 --> 00:08:56.568
oftentimes when people shared
the mistakes they were having,

00:08:56.592 --> 00:08:59.300
the error, the noise in the signal
they were discovering.

00:08:59.324 --> 00:09:01.293
And something about that environment --

00:09:01.317 --> 00:09:03.622
and I've started calling it
the "liquid network,"

00:09:03.646 --> 00:09:06.592
where you have lots of different
ideas that are together,

00:09:06.616 --> 00:09:08.645
different backgrounds,
different interests,

00:09:08.669 --> 00:09:11.110
jostling with each other,
bouncing off each other --

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:14.598
that environment is, in fact,
the environment that leads to innovation.

00:09:14.622 --> 00:09:16.445
The other problem that people have is,

00:09:16.469 --> 00:09:18.836
they like to condense
their stories of innovation

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.528
down to shorter time frames.

00:09:20.552 --> 00:09:23.218
So they want to tell the story
of the eureka moment.

00:09:23.242 --> 00:09:25.731
They want to say,
"There I was, I was standing there,

00:09:25.755 --> 00:09:27.919
and I had it all,
suddenly, clear in my head."

00:09:27.943 --> 00:09:30.901
But, in fact, if you go back
and look at the historical record,

00:09:30.925 --> 00:09:36.459
it turns out that a lot of important ideas
have very long incubation periods.

00:09:36.483 --> 00:09:38.388
I call this the "slow hunch."

00:09:38.412 --> 00:09:42.943
We've heard a lot recently
about hunch and instinct

00:09:42.967 --> 00:09:46.068
and blink-like sudden moments of clarity,

00:09:46.092 --> 00:09:50.144
but, in fact, a lot of great ideas
linger on, sometimes for decades,

00:09:50.168 --> 00:09:51.625
in the back of people's minds.

00:09:51.649 --> 00:09:54.278
They have a feeling
that there's an interesting problem,

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:56.977
but they don't quite have
the tools yet to discover them.

00:09:57.001 --> 00:09:59.487
They spend all this time
working on certain problems,

00:09:59.511 --> 00:10:02.795
but there's another thing lingering there
that they're interested in,

00:10:02.819 --> 00:10:04.010
but can't quite solve.

00:10:04.034 --> 00:10:05.669
Darwin is a great example of this.

00:10:05.693 --> 00:10:07.697
Darwin himself, in his autobiography,

00:10:07.721 --> 00:10:11.265
tells the story of coming up with the idea
for natural selection

00:10:11.289 --> 00:10:13.266
as a classic eureka moment.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.981
He's in his study, it's October of 1838,

00:10:17.005 --> 00:10:19.860
and he's reading Malthus,
actually, on population.

00:10:19.884 --> 00:10:21.068
And all of a sudden,

00:10:21.092 --> 00:10:24.283
the basic algorithm of natural selection
kind of pops into his head,

00:10:24.307 --> 00:10:27.462
and he says, "Ah, at last, I had
a theory with which to work."

00:10:27.486 --> 00:10:29.357
That's in his autobiography.

00:10:29.381 --> 00:10:30.706
About a decade or two ago,

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:32.706
a wonderful scholar named Howard Gruber

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:36.389
went back and looked
at Darwin's notebooks from this period.

00:10:36.413 --> 00:10:38.180
Darwin kept these copious notebooks,

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:41.295
where he wrote down every little idea
he had, every little hunch.

00:10:41.319 --> 00:10:46.612
And what Gruber found was that Darwin had
the full theory of natural selection

00:10:46.636 --> 00:10:48.245
for months and months and months

00:10:48.269 --> 00:10:53.170
before he had his alleged epiphany
reading Malthus in October of 1838.

00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:55.172
There are passages where you can read it,

00:10:55.196 --> 00:10:58.297
and you think you're reading
from a Darwin textbook,

00:10:58.321 --> 00:11:00.775
from the period
before he has his epiphany.

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:03.256
And so what you realize
is that Darwin, in a sense,

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.083
had the idea, he had the concept,

00:11:05.107 --> 00:11:08.337
but was unable to fully think it yet.

00:11:08.361 --> 00:11:11.244
And that is, actually,
how great ideas often happen --

00:11:11.268 --> 00:11:13.799
they fade into view
over long periods of time.

00:11:13.823 --> 00:11:15.667
Now the challenge for all of us is:

00:11:15.691 --> 00:11:17.133
How do you create environments

00:11:17.157 --> 00:11:19.904
that allow these ideas
to have this long half-life?

00:11:19.928 --> 00:11:21.703
It's hard to go to your boss and say,

00:11:21.727 --> 00:11:23.948
"I have an excellent idea
for our organization.

00:11:23.972 --> 00:11:25.343
It will be useful in 2020."

00:11:25.367 --> 00:11:26.786
(Laughter)

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:29.022
"Could you just give me
some time to do that?"

00:11:29.046 --> 00:11:32.888
Now a couple of companies like Google
have innovation time off, 20 percent time.

00:11:32.912 --> 00:11:36.250
In a sense, those are hunch-cultivating
mechanisms in an organization.

00:11:36.274 --> 00:11:38.047
But that's a key thing.

00:11:38.071 --> 00:11:40.474
And the other thing
is to allow those hunches

00:11:40.498 --> 00:11:42.379
to connect with other people's hunches;

00:11:42.403 --> 00:11:43.658
that's what often happens.

00:11:43.682 --> 00:11:46.460
You have half of an idea,
somebody else has the other half,

00:11:46.484 --> 00:11:48.350
and if you're in the right environment,

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:51.194
they turn into something larger
than the sum of their parts.

00:11:51.218 --> 00:11:52.370
So in a sense,

00:11:52.394 --> 00:11:55.622
we often talk about the value
of protecting intellectual property --

00:11:55.646 --> 00:11:57.081
you know, building barricades,

00:11:57.105 --> 00:12:00.955
having secretive R and D labs,
patenting everything that we have

00:12:00.979 --> 00:12:03.446
so that those ideas will remain valuable,

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:06.325
and people will be incentivized
to come up with more ideas,

00:12:06.349 --> 00:12:08.552
and the culture will be more innovative.

00:12:08.576 --> 00:12:10.352
But I think there's a case to be made

00:12:10.376 --> 00:12:13.012
that we should spend
at least as much time, if not more,

00:12:13.036 --> 00:12:14.977
valuing the premise of connecting ideas

00:12:15.001 --> 00:12:16.827
and not just protecting them.

00:12:17.809 --> 00:12:19.497
And I'll leave you with this story,

00:12:19.521 --> 00:12:21.873
which I think captures
a lot of these values.

00:12:21.897 --> 00:12:27.407
It's just a wonderful tale of innovation,
and how it happens in unlikely ways.

00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:30.590
It's October of 1957,

00:12:30.614 --> 00:12:32.717
and Sputnik has just launched.

00:12:32.741 --> 00:12:34.786
And we're in Laurel, Maryland,

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:39.290
at the Applied Physics Lab
associated with Johns Hopkins University.

00:12:39.314 --> 00:12:40.537
It's Monday morning,

00:12:40.561 --> 00:12:43.297
and the news has just
broken about this satellite

00:12:43.321 --> 00:12:44.899
that's now orbiting the planet.

00:12:44.923 --> 00:12:47.453
And, of course,
this is nerd heaven, right?

00:12:47.477 --> 00:12:49.787
There are all these physics
geeks who are there,

00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:53.506
thinking, "Oh my gosh! This is incredible.
I can't believe this has happened."

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:56.348
And two of them, two twentysomething
researchers at the APL,

00:12:56.372 --> 00:12:58.460
are there at the cafeteria table,

00:12:58.484 --> 00:13:01.540
having an informal conversation
with a bunch of their colleagues.

00:13:01.564 --> 00:13:03.981
And these two guys
are named Guier and Weiffenbach.

00:13:04.005 --> 00:13:05.964
They start talking, and one of them says,

00:13:05.988 --> 00:13:08.901
"Hey, has anybody tried
to listen for this thing?

00:13:08.925 --> 00:13:12.316
There's this, you know, man-made
satellite up there in outer space

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.695
that's obviously broadcasting
some kind of signal.

00:13:14.719 --> 00:13:16.727
We could probably hear it, if we tune in."

00:13:16.751 --> 00:13:19.138
So they ask around
to a couple of their colleagues,

00:13:19.162 --> 00:13:21.901
and everybody's like,
"No, I hadn't thought of doing that.

00:13:21.925 --> 00:13:23.267
That's an interesting idea."

00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:27.220
And it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of
an expert in microwave reception,

00:13:27.244 --> 00:13:31.108
and he's got a little antenna set up
with an amplifier in his office.

00:13:31.132 --> 00:13:33.836
So Guier and Weiffenbach
go back to Weiffenbach's office,

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.156
and they start noodling around --
"hacking," as we might call it now.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:40.281
And after a couple of hours,
they start picking up the signal,

00:13:40.305 --> 00:13:43.351
because the Soviets made Sputnik
very easy to track;

00:13:43.375 --> 00:13:46.338
it was right at 20 MHz,
so you could pick it up really easily,

00:13:46.362 --> 00:13:49.612
because they were afraid people
would think it was a hoax, basically,

00:13:49.636 --> 00:13:51.372
so they made it really easy to find.

00:13:51.396 --> 00:13:54.274
So these guys are sitting there,
listening to this signal,

00:13:54.298 --> 00:13:56.693
and people start coming
into the office and saying,

00:13:56.717 --> 00:13:58.315
"That's pretty cool. Can I hear?"

00:13:58.339 --> 00:14:01.260
And before long, they think,
"Jeez, this is kind of historic.

00:14:01.284 --> 00:14:04.400
We may be the first people
in the United States listening to this.

00:14:04.424 --> 00:14:05.583
We should record it."

00:14:05.607 --> 00:14:08.155
So they bring in this big,
clunky analog tape recorder

00:14:08.179 --> 00:14:10.573
and start recording
these little bleep, bleeps.

00:14:10.597 --> 00:14:13.236
And they start writing down
the date stamp, time stamps

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.583
for each little bleep that they record.

00:14:16.643 --> 00:14:18.044
And then they start thinking,

00:14:18.068 --> 00:14:21.311
"Well, gosh, we're noticing
small little frequency variations here.

00:14:21.335 --> 00:14:26.326
We could probably calculate
the speed that the satellite is traveling

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:30.380
if we do a little basic math here
using the Doppler effect."

00:14:30.904 --> 00:14:33.160
And they played around
with it a little bit more

00:14:33.184 --> 00:14:36.993
and talked to a couple of their colleagues
who had other specialties.

00:14:37.017 --> 00:14:38.228
And they said, "You know,

00:14:38.252 --> 00:14:40.973
we could actually look
at the slope of the Doppler effect

00:14:40.997 --> 00:14:44.521
to figure out the points at which
the satellite is closest to our antenna

00:14:44.545 --> 00:14:46.669
and the points
at which it's furthest away.

00:14:46.693 --> 00:14:47.845
That's pretty cool."

00:14:47.869 --> 00:14:51.093
Eventually, they get permission --
this is all a little side project

00:14:51.117 --> 00:14:53.946
that hadn't been officially part
of their job description --

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.469
they get permission to use
the new UNIVAC computer

00:14:56.493 --> 00:14:59.523
that takes up an entire room
that they'd just gotten at the APL.

00:14:59.547 --> 00:15:01.366
And they run some more of the numbers,

00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.440
and at the end
of about three or four weeks,

00:15:03.464 --> 00:15:05.670
turns out they have mapped
the exact trajectory

00:15:05.694 --> 00:15:07.366
of this satellite around the Earth,

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:09.560
just from listening
to this one little signal,

00:15:09.584 --> 00:15:12.963
going off on this little side hunch
that they'd been inspired to do

00:15:12.987 --> 00:15:14.798
over lunch one morning.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.310
A couple weeks later,
their boss, Frank McClure,

00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:19.976
pulls them into the room and says,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.271
"Hey, you guys,
I have to ask you something

00:15:22.295 --> 00:15:24.170
about that project you were working on.

00:15:24.194 --> 00:15:27.228
You've figured out an unknown location

00:15:27.252 --> 00:15:31.644
of a satellite orbiting the planet
from a known location on the ground.

00:15:32.034 --> 00:15:33.636
Could you go the other way?

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.209
Could you figure out
an unknown location on the ground

00:15:36.233 --> 00:15:38.306
if you knew the location
of the satellite?"

00:15:38.838 --> 00:15:40.748
And they thought about it and they said,

00:15:40.772 --> 00:15:43.756
"Well, I guess maybe you could.
Let's run the numbers here."

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.609
So they went back and thought about it

00:15:45.633 --> 00:15:48.071
and came back and said,
"Actually, it'll be easier."

00:15:48.095 --> 00:15:49.623
And he said, "Oh, that's great,

00:15:49.647 --> 00:15:52.155
because, see, I have these
new nuclear submarines"

00:15:52.179 --> 00:15:53.181
(Laughter)

00:15:53.205 --> 00:15:54.552
"that I'm building.

00:15:54.576 --> 00:15:57.445
And it's really hard to figure out
how to get your missile

00:15:57.469 --> 00:15:59.562
so that it will land
right on top of Moscow

00:15:59.586 --> 00:16:03.175
if you don't know where the submarine is
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

00:16:03.199 --> 00:16:05.933
So we're thinking we could
throw up a bunch of satellites

00:16:05.957 --> 00:16:08.660
and use it to track our submarines

00:16:08.684 --> 00:16:11.365
and figure out their location
in the middle of the ocean.

00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:12.918
Could you work on that problem?"

00:16:12.942 --> 00:16:15.183
And that's how GPS was born.

00:16:16.168 --> 00:16:17.335
Thirty years later,

00:16:17.359 --> 00:16:20.825
Ronald Reagan, actually, opened it up
and made it an open platform

00:16:20.849 --> 00:16:22.469
that anybody could build upon,

00:16:22.493 --> 00:16:25.047
and anybody could come along
and build new technology

00:16:25.071 --> 00:16:29.112
that would create and innovate
on top of this open platform,

00:16:29.136 --> 00:16:32.916
left it open for anyone to do
pretty much anything they wanted with it.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:38.019
And now, I guarantee you,
certainly half of this room, if not more,

00:16:38.043 --> 00:16:40.218
has a device sitting
in their pocket right now

00:16:40.242 --> 00:16:43.001
that is talking to one
of these satellites in outer space.

00:16:43.025 --> 00:16:45.786
And I bet you one of you, if not more,

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:48.932
has used said device
and said satellite system

00:16:48.956 --> 00:16:52.500
to locate a nearby coffeehouse
somewhere in the last --

00:16:52.524 --> 00:16:53.954
(Laughter)

00:16:53.978 --> 00:16:56.786
in the last day or last week, right?

00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:00.083
(Applause)

00:17:00.107 --> 00:17:01.679
And that, I think,

00:17:01.703 --> 00:17:04.252
is a great case study, a great lesson

00:17:04.276 --> 00:17:09.220
in the power -- the marvelous, unplanned,
emergent, unpredictable power --

00:17:09.244 --> 00:17:11.238
of open innovative systems.

00:17:11.262 --> 00:17:12.502
When you build them right,

00:17:12.526 --> 00:17:14.632
they will be led
to completely new directions

00:17:14.656 --> 00:17:16.327
the creators never even dreamed of.

00:17:16.351 --> 00:17:17.876
I mean, here you have these guys

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.620
who basically thought
they were just following this hunch,

00:17:20.644 --> 00:17:22.524
this little passion that had developed,

00:17:22.548 --> 00:17:24.891
then they thought
they were fighting the Cold War,

00:17:24.915 --> 00:17:28.286
and then, it turns out, they're just
helping somebody find a soy latte.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:29.444
(Laughter)

00:17:29.468 --> 00:17:31.607
That is how innovation happens.

00:17:31.631 --> 00:17:33.802
Chance favors the connected mind.

00:17:33.826 --> 00:17:35.135
Thank you very much.

00:17:35.159 --> 00:17:40.537
(Applause)
