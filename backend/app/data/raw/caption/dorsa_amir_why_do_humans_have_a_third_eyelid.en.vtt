00:00:07.088 --> 00:00:10.668
You know that little pink thing nestled 
in the corner of your eye?

00:00:10.668 --> 00:00:13.998
It’s actually the remnant 
of a third eyelid.

00:00:13.998 --> 00:00:16.148
Known as the “plica semilunaris,”

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:19.368
it’s much more prominent in birds 
and a few mammals,

00:00:19.368 --> 00:00:24.455
and functions like a windshield wiper 
to keep dust and debris out of their eyes.

00:00:24.455 --> 00:00:26.805
But in humans, it doesn’t work.

00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:31.482
It’s vestigial, meaning it no longer 
serves its original purpose.

00:00:31.482 --> 00:00:35.683
There are several other vestigial 
structures like the plica semilunaris

00:00:35.683 --> 00:00:37.013
in the human body.

00:00:37.013 --> 00:00:41.450
Most of these became vestigial long 
before homo sapiens existed,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.885
quietly riding along from one of 
our ancestor species to the next.

00:00:45.885 --> 00:00:49.145
But why have they stuck 
around for so long?

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:53.085
To answer this question, it helps to 
understand natural selection.

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:55.505
Natural selection simply means that traits

00:00:55.505 --> 00:00:59.760
which help an organism survive and 
reproduce in a given environment

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.920
are more likely to make it to the 
next generation.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.878
As the environment changes, traits 
that were once useful can become harmful.

00:01:07.878 --> 00:01:10.648
Those traits are often selected against,

00:01:10.648 --> 00:01:14.108
meaning they gradually disappear 
from the population.

00:01:14.108 --> 00:01:19.458
But if a trait isn’t actively harmful, 
it might not get selected against,

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:23.058
and stick around even 
though it isn’t useful.

00:01:23.058 --> 00:01:24.558
Take the tailbone.

00:01:24.558 --> 00:01:28.451
Evolutionary biologists think that as the 
climate got drier

00:01:28.451 --> 00:01:30.271
and grasslands popped up,

00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:35.371
our tail-bearing ancestors left the trees 
and started walking on land.

00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:37.431
The tails that had helped them 
in the trees

00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:40.461
began to disrupt their ability 
to walk on land.

00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:44.721
So individuals with mutations that reduced
the length of their tails

00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:47.504
became more successful at life on land,

00:01:47.504 --> 00:01:51.981
surviving long enough to pass their short 
tails on to the next generation.

00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:55.891
The change was likely gradual over 
millions of years until,

00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:57.841
about 20 million years ago,

00:01:57.841 --> 00:02:02.235
our ancestors’ external tails disappeared 
altogether.

00:02:02.235 --> 00:02:07.355
Today, we know human embryos have tails
that dissolve as the embryo develops.

00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:09.945
But the stubby tailbone sticks around,

00:02:09.945 --> 00:02:12.305
probably because it doesn’t 
cause any harm—

00:02:12.305 --> 00:02:14.869
in fact, it serves a more minor function

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:18.085
as the anchor point for certain 
other muscles.

00:02:18.085 --> 00:02:23.391
Up to 85% of people have a vestigial 
muscle called the “palmaris longus.”

00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:24.581
To see if you do,

00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:29.011
put your hand down on a flat surface 
and touch your pinkie to your thumb.

00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:32.821
If you see a little band pop up in the 
middle of your wrist,

00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:36.984
that’s the tendon that attaches to this 
now-defunct muscle.

00:02:36.984 --> 00:02:42.244
In this case, the fact that not everyone 
has it has helped us trace its function.

00:02:42.244 --> 00:02:46.401
Vestigial traits can persist when there’s 
no incentive to lose them—

00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:49.254
but since there’s also no incentive 
to keep them,

00:02:49.254 --> 00:02:52.631
random mutations will sometimes still
eliminate them

00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:54.541
from part of the population.

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.341
Looking at our primate relatives,

00:02:56.341 --> 00:02:59.921
we can see that the palmaris longus 
is sometimes absent

00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:02.831
in those that spend more time on the land,

00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:07.089
but always present in those that spend 
more time in trees.

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:10.819
So we think it used to help us swing 
from branch to branch,

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.459
and became unnecessary when 
we moved down to land.

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.195
The appendix, meanwhile, may once have 
been part of the intestinal system

00:03:19.195 --> 00:03:22.955
our ancestors used for digesting 
plant materials.

00:03:22.955 --> 00:03:27.695
As their diets changed, those parts of the
intestinal system began to shrink.

00:03:27.695 --> 00:03:32.772
Unlike other vestigial structures, though,
the appendix isn’t always harmless—

00:03:32.772 --> 00:03:35.602
it can become dangerously inflamed.

00:03:35.602 --> 00:03:39.706
For most of human history, a burst 
appendix could be a death sentence.

00:03:39.706 --> 00:03:41.726
So why did it stick around?

00:03:41.726 --> 00:03:45.376
It’s possible that it was very slowly on 
its way out,

00:03:45.376 --> 00:03:49.196
or that mutations simply hadn’t arisen 
to make it smaller.

00:03:49.196 --> 00:03:51.846
Or maybe it has other benefits—

00:03:51.846 --> 00:03:57.932
for example, it might still be a reservoir
of bacteria that helps us break down food.

00:03:57.932 --> 00:04:02.373
But the fact is, we’re not really sure why
the appendix persists.

00:04:02.373 --> 00:04:04.953
Evolution is an imperfect process.

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:10.864
Human beings are the result of millions of
years of trial, error, and random chance—

00:04:10.864 --> 00:04:15.173
and we’re full of evolutionary relics 
to remind us of that.
