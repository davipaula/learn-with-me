00:00:07.475 --> 00:00:10.425
Every time you breathe in, 
air travels down the trachea,

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:12.705
through a series of channels
called bronchi,

00:00:12.705 --> 00:00:17.050
and finally reaches little clusters
of air sacs called alveoli.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.980
There are some 600 million alveoli
in the lungs,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.410
adding up to a surface area 
of roughly 75 square meters—

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.440
the size of a tennis court.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.690
These tiny sacs, only one cell thick,
facilitate a crucial exchange:

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.730
allowing oxygen from the air 
we breathe into the bloodstream

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.710
and clearing out carbon dioxide.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.550
Pneumonia wreaks havoc 
on this exchange.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.820
Pneumonia is an infection of the alveoli
that causes them to fill with fluid.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.140
There are many different kinds 
of pathogens that can cause pneumonia.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.010
The most common ones 
are viruses or bacteria.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.403
These microscopic invaders enter the body
via droplets either in the air we breathe,

00:00:54.403 --> 00:00:56.823
or when we touch our eyes, noses,

00:00:56.823 --> 00:01:00.293
or mouths after touching 
a contaminated surface.

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:04.293
Then, they face the respiratory tract’s
first line defense:

00:01:04.293 --> 00:01:06.293
the mucociliary escalator.

00:01:06.293 --> 00:01:10.896
The mucociliary escalator consists of
mucus that traps invaders and tiny hairs

00:01:10.896 --> 00:01:15.461
called cilia that carry the mucus toward
the mouth, where it can be coughed out.

00:01:15.461 --> 00:01:18.761
But some of these invaders 
may get past the mucociliary escalator

00:01:18.761 --> 00:01:21.821
into the lungs,
where they meet the alveoli.

00:01:21.821 --> 00:01:24.311
Because alveoli serve 
as critical exchange points

00:01:24.311 --> 00:01:26.691
between the blood and air 
from the outside world,

00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:31.157
they have their own specialized types
of white blood cells, or macrophages,

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:35.756
which defend against foreign organisms
by enveloping and eating them.

00:01:35.756 --> 00:01:40.485
When pathogens enter the lungs,
the macrophages work to destroy them.

00:01:40.485 --> 00:01:45.439
The immune system releases additional
white blood cells in the alveoli to help.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.049
As these immune cells fight the pathogens,
they generate inflammation—

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.819
and fluid as a by-product 
of the inflammation.

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.359
When this fluid builds up,

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:56.979
it makes gas exchange inside 
the alveoli much more difficult.

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.639
As the level of carbon dioxide 
in the bloodstream begins to rise,

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:05.363
the body breathes more quickly to try
to clear it out and get more oxygen in.

00:02:05.363 --> 00:02:09.143
This rapid breathing is one of the most
common symptoms of pneumonia.

00:02:09.143 --> 00:02:14.298
The body also tries to force the fluid out
of the alveoli through coughing.

00:02:14.298 --> 00:02:17.038
Determining the cause of pneumonia 
can be difficult,

00:02:17.038 --> 00:02:20.778
but once it is established, 
doctors can prescribe antibiotics,

00:02:20.778 --> 00:02:25.352
which may include either antibacterial
or antiviral treatments.

00:02:25.352 --> 00:02:29.270
Treatment with antibiotics helps 
the body get the infection under control.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.220
As the pathogen is cleared out,

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.659
the body gradually expels or absorbs
fluid and dead cells.

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.589
The worst symptoms typically fade out
in about a week,

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:42.029
though full recovery may take 
as long as a month.

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:45.709
Otherwise healthy adults can often
manage pneumonia at home.

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.879
But for some groups, pneumonia 
can be a lot more severe,

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.499
requiring hospitalization and oxygen,
artificial ventilation,

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:56.499
or other supportive measures 
while the body fights the infection.

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:58.459
Smoking damages the cilia,

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.139
making them less able to clear even
the normal amount of mucus and secretions,

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:05.919
let alone the increased volume 
associated with pneumonia.

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.589
Genetic and autoimmune disorders

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:11.699
can make someone more susceptible
to pathogens that can cause pneumonia.

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.989
Young children and the elderly 
also have impaired clearance

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.659
and weaker immune systems.

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.509
And if someone has viral pneumonia,

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:22.509
their risk of bacterial respiratory
infection is higher.

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:26.269
Many of the deaths from pneumonia 
are due to lack of access to healthcare.

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.759
But sometimes, even with appropriate care,

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:33.669
the body enters a sustained fight against
the infection it can’t maintain,

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.699
activating inflammatory pathways
throughout the body,

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:38.739
not just in the lungs.

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.719
This is actually a protective mechanism,

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:44.319
but after too long in this state organs
start shutting down,

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.899
causing shock and sometimes death.

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:48.939
So how can we prevent pneumonia?

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.639
Eating well and getting enough sleep
and exercise

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.219
helps your body fight off infections.

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:57.579
Vaccines can protect against common 
pneumonia-causing pathogens,

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.669
while washing your hands regularly helps
prevent the spread of these pathogens—

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:05.159
and protect those most vulnerable
to severe pneumonia.
