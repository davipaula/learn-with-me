Reviewer: Sophia Kuchina

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:17.377
Hello, Manchester.
I'm so happy to be here.

00:00:17.904 --> 00:00:20.474
(Responses) (Cheers)

00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:22.998
My name is Sophia Wallace.

00:00:23.038 --> 00:00:24.081
I'm an artist.

00:00:24.111 --> 00:00:26.817
And I'm here today
to share with you a project

00:00:26.847 --> 00:00:29.218
that I hope will empower you personally,

00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:31.824
and by extension those that you love,

00:00:31.858 --> 00:00:34.553
especially if they have a clitoris.

00:00:34.573 --> 00:00:35.919
(Cheers)

00:00:38.617 --> 00:00:40.147
(Laughter)

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:42.776
To make this work,

00:00:42.806 --> 00:00:46.314
I have to talk about
independent female desire.

00:00:46.344 --> 00:00:48.958
I have to speak about a universal taboo -

00:00:48.988 --> 00:00:50.553
female genitals.

00:00:50.688 --> 00:00:52.327
This is not easy.

00:00:53.918 --> 00:00:55.995
It taints the speaker.

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:58.687
I want to thank TEDxSalford

00:00:58.717 --> 00:01:01.610
for having me here
and hosting this conversation.

00:01:07.413 --> 00:01:09.999
All bodies are entitled
to experience the pleasure

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:11.803
that they are capable of.

00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:15.017
This is a core pillar of cliteracy.

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:17.598
In making this work,

00:01:18.054 --> 00:01:20.312
I had to say that the clitoris,

00:01:20.783 --> 00:01:23.577
first, as an organ, has a right to being,

00:01:23.942 --> 00:01:28.446
and that this right
is not just about not being cut off.

00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:30.308
Sadly, to this day,

00:01:30.338 --> 00:01:32.008
over a 140 million women

00:01:32.048 --> 00:01:34.918
have had their external
clitorises cut off.

00:01:35.257 --> 00:01:37.624
This doesn't make it
into the news very often,

00:01:37.654 --> 00:01:40.385
and this doesn't come up
in foreign policy discussion.

00:01:40.688 --> 00:01:41.784
So number one,

00:01:41.804 --> 00:01:46.184
the clitoris has a right to exist,
free of harm, like any other organ.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.521
But secondly, I argue with cliteracy

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.233
that the clitoris has a right to pleasure,

00:01:52.273 --> 00:01:55.194
and this is part
of its primary right of being.

00:01:57.074 --> 00:02:00.415
How is it possible
that we landed on the Moon

00:02:00.455 --> 00:02:02.800
and walked around 29 years

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.957
before we discovered
the anatomy of the clitoris?

00:02:08.375 --> 00:02:11.175
(Laughter)

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.263
We actually cloned sheep,
identified the Higgs boson particle,

00:02:16.283 --> 00:02:19.270
and only discovered
the clitoris 29 years ago.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.576
Unfortunately, this discovery
has not been adopted,

00:02:22.616 --> 00:02:26.409
so most people don't know
the actual anatomy of the clitoris.

00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:31.566
The clitoris is not a button.
It is an iceberg.

00:02:34.298 --> 00:02:37.205
Like many in the room
who are hearing this for the first time,

00:02:37.225 --> 00:02:38.426
I was shocked to find out

00:02:38.456 --> 00:02:42.330
that I didn't know the actual anatomy
of half of the population,

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:44.488
that I didn't know my own anatomy.

00:02:44.616 --> 00:02:47.972
In fact, the clitoris is not a button,
it is like an iceberg.

00:02:48.002 --> 00:02:50.331
Most of the organ is internal.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.950
This slide is an anatomical example

00:02:54.978 --> 00:02:58.271
of the penis and the clitoris
side by side.

00:02:58.302 --> 00:03:00.164
Now, we've all been taught

00:03:00.192 --> 00:03:04.069
that male bodies
and female bodies are opposites:

00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:08.099
the male body sort of sticks out,
the female body is solely internal.

00:03:08.122 --> 00:03:09.147
Well, in fact,

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:13.023
there're so many similarities
between the penis and the clitoris.

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:14.456
So, if you'll see,

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:16.938
both the glans and -

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.479
The glans of the penis
and the glans of the clitoris -

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.129
both organs have a glans.

00:03:21.163 --> 00:03:24.269
There are 3000 nerves
in the glans of the penis.

00:03:24.293 --> 00:03:26.979
There are 8000 nerves
in the glans of the clitoris.

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.505
Both organs have a corpus cavernosum.

00:03:29.523 --> 00:03:34.100
Both organs have crura,
like two little legs or wings.

00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:36.466
Both organs have bulbs of erectile tissue.

00:03:36.496 --> 00:03:38.408
Both organs get erect.

00:03:38.786 --> 00:03:41.301
The penis is outside of the body mostly,

00:03:41.327 --> 00:03:43.446
and the clitoris
is inside the body mostly.

00:03:43.465 --> 00:03:44.927
That's the biggest difference.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.426
In fact, they're very similar.

00:03:46.441 --> 00:03:49.342
Actually, fetuses have the same tissue,

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:53.191
and in boys it develops as a penis,
in girls it develops as a clitoris.

00:03:53.547 --> 00:03:57.444
Some people have small penises,
some people have very large clitorises.

00:03:57.454 --> 00:04:00.114
If one has a clitoris
and takes testosterone,

00:04:00.147 --> 00:04:01.841
their clitoris can expand.

00:04:01.863 --> 00:04:04.904
What I'm saying is that
these organs are actually quite similar.

00:04:04.936 --> 00:04:08.403
And, while we are different,
while we are unique as men and women,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.741
our differences
are not a sign of opposition.

00:04:11.778 --> 00:04:15.999
In fact, we're related to each other,
we're connected.

00:04:16.016 --> 00:04:18.432
And that's an exciting fact.

00:04:21.478 --> 00:04:24.005
With Cliteracy, I started with language.

00:04:24.027 --> 00:04:25.242
Language has been a place

00:04:25.266 --> 00:04:28.065
that so much of sort of
the division of men and women

00:04:28.087 --> 00:04:31.796
and the subjugation of women has been
entrenched with the language itself.

00:04:32.983 --> 00:04:36.595
'Vagina' - the single most misused word
in the English language.

00:04:36.742 --> 00:04:38.517
This is one of the laws of Cliteracy.

00:04:38.557 --> 00:04:40.282
It's intentionally hyperbolic.

00:04:40.294 --> 00:04:43.379
But unfortunately, it's more true
than I wish it was.

00:04:43.406 --> 00:04:47.103
'Vagina' is a Latin word.
It means 'sword holder'.

00:04:47.915 --> 00:04:50.905
(Laughter)

00:04:54.143 --> 00:04:58.399
Vagina, medically, technically,
only includes the opening.

00:04:59.125 --> 00:05:02.282
This term is used almost universally
in doctor's offices.

00:05:02.306 --> 00:05:05.852
It's also used in feminism
to sort of advocate.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.885
But it's a term that ignores the clitoris,

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:11.221
which is the female sexual organ.

00:05:11.422 --> 00:05:16.232
And secondly, it reduces the female body
to being a receptacle, a sword holder.

00:05:16.643 --> 00:05:19.780
If you want to use a term
that addresses all the female genitals,

00:05:19.806 --> 00:05:22.415
both the reproductive
and the sexual parts of it,

00:05:22.434 --> 00:05:24.127
the word is 'vulva'.

00:05:24.484 --> 00:05:26.362
This is a word that almost no one uses,

00:05:26.382 --> 00:05:29.911
but this is the word if you want to
talk about female genitals - vulva.

00:05:29.933 --> 00:05:34.504
If you want to talk about pleasure,
'clitoris' is the term.

00:05:34.538 --> 00:05:36.548
The clitoris is both
internal and external.

00:05:36.578 --> 00:05:39.685
So, when the clitoris is engaged,

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.271
internal stimulation feels great.

00:05:41.354 --> 00:05:44.072
If the clitoris is not engaged,
it can feel not great,

00:05:44.106 --> 00:05:45.247
or it can feel painful.

00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:47.616
It's all about what's happening
with the clitoris.

00:05:47.652 --> 00:05:49.398
If it was about the vagina,

00:05:49.428 --> 00:05:52.540
there would be so many nerves
that childbirth would be impossible.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.428
There're very few nerves in the vagina.

00:05:54.458 --> 00:05:57.425
All of the nerves inside
are from the internal clitoris,

00:05:57.438 --> 00:06:01.085
which gets stimulated
both from external and internal portions.

00:06:03.713 --> 00:06:05.922
With Cliteracy I felt that -

00:06:05.943 --> 00:06:07.706
Yes, language has been this way

00:06:07.736 --> 00:06:10.106
of restricting and confining
the female body,

00:06:10.126 --> 00:06:12.014
but if language can do these thing,

00:06:12.035 --> 00:06:15.177
it can also liberate,
it can also be expansive.

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:17.559
It's also an opportunity to come together.

00:06:17.793 --> 00:06:22.638
And so I sought to use language
as a way to shift the discourse

00:06:22.661 --> 00:06:25.719
and create new space and more alignment.

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:31.698
With Cliteracy,
I first began with the term,

00:06:31.715 --> 00:06:33.629
and then a definition of the term,

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.204
and then an eye chart.

00:06:35.374 --> 00:06:36.800
The aesthetics of this project

00:06:36.835 --> 00:06:39.183
were also extremely
important and intentional.

00:06:39.217 --> 00:06:41.781
I avoided any kind of pink and purple;

00:06:42.438 --> 00:06:44.161
I didn't use flowers;

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.990
I didn't use any fabric or yarn,

00:06:47.014 --> 00:06:49.226
anything soft and fluffy.

00:06:49.257 --> 00:06:53.275
I also didn't make any small works
that you could hold in your hand

00:06:53.293 --> 00:06:55.333
or eat off of like plates.

00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:58.929
I also intentionally avoided
any kind of sexual imagery,

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:03.097
any kind of graphic, close-up,
literal depictions.

00:07:03.115 --> 00:07:06.858
I think that everywhere we see
the exposed female body,

00:07:06.877 --> 00:07:11.199
and yet we don't know the actual
female sexual organ, the clitoris.

00:07:11.245 --> 00:07:13.354
So showing it is not the point, right?

00:07:13.376 --> 00:07:14.880
Understanding it is the point.

00:07:14.928 --> 00:07:17.773
Literacy of it, knowledge
of it is the point.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.390
[The hole is not the whole]

00:07:20.407 --> 00:07:22.977
(Laughter)

00:07:22.997 --> 00:07:25.010
The hole is not the whole.

00:07:25.037 --> 00:07:27.333
With Cliteracy I had a lot of fun
with word-play.

00:07:27.373 --> 00:07:29.435
There was just so much
material to work with

00:07:29.465 --> 00:07:31.422
and so much to talk about.

00:07:34.175 --> 00:07:37.096
I also am making
the radical claim with Cliteracy

00:07:37.115 --> 00:07:39.021
that we can't truly be free

00:07:39.049 --> 00:07:40.589
if our bodies are assailed.

00:07:40.619 --> 00:07:45.063
We can't truly be fully
enjoying our democracy

00:07:45.084 --> 00:07:46.813
when half of the population

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:50.084
can't speak about their own body,
is censored when they say the words

00:07:50.119 --> 00:07:51.646
because these words are taboo,

00:07:51.664 --> 00:07:54.504
or are regularly having sex
without orgasms.

00:07:54.537 --> 00:07:56.355
And we don't talk about this.

00:07:56.517 --> 00:08:00.188
I'm making the radical claim
that freedom in society

00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:02.716
can also be measured
by the distribution of orgasms.

00:08:02.745 --> 00:08:04.651
This could be one indicator that we use

00:08:04.662 --> 00:08:09.872
when we look at education,
access to health care,

00:08:11.235 --> 00:08:12.235
economics.

00:08:12.265 --> 00:08:15.470
We could also say: How
are orgasms being distributed?

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.153
That tells us something about a society.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.446
There is no lack.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.658
Truly.

00:08:24.081 --> 00:08:27.399
Freud invented the paradigm
of the phallus versus the lack.

00:08:27.416 --> 00:08:31.748
He said that men have the phallus,
they have the penis, they have agency;

00:08:31.772 --> 00:08:36.029
women have a lack,
they have a vagina, they have a void.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.634
In fact, Freud was wrong,

00:08:38.883 --> 00:08:41.789
the vagina is not the female
sexual organ, it is the clitoris.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:46.192
There is no lack, none of us have lack,
none of us are lacking, we're all whole.

00:08:47.513 --> 00:08:53.134
And none of us need to be depicted
in terms solely of a void.

00:08:54.657 --> 00:08:57.367
[Girls are taught it's normal
for sex to hurt. Phallusy.]

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.889
In many ways, all of us have had
a psychological clitoridectomy

00:09:01.917 --> 00:09:04.539
because the clitoris is never taught.

00:09:05.358 --> 00:09:10.608
In sex education it is taught that
boys are both sexual and reproductive,

00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:14.396
boys have erections, boys have wet dreams,

00:09:14.725 --> 00:09:16.153
boys ejaculate,

00:09:16.163 --> 00:09:18.794
and then the semen fertilizes the egg.

00:09:19.414 --> 00:09:23.294
Girls, we're taught,
have reproductive organs,

00:09:23.322 --> 00:09:27.026
they menstruate, menstruation is painful.

00:09:27.136 --> 00:09:30.533
Girls should not get pregnant
if they don't mean to.

00:09:30.561 --> 00:09:33.056
Girls should not get
sexually transmitted diseases.

00:09:33.081 --> 00:09:34.700
We never learn about the clitoris.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.714
We never learn that girls have desire,

00:09:36.748 --> 00:09:38.389
that this is natural,

00:09:38.855 --> 00:09:42.244
that girls have sexual dreams,
that girls have fantasies.

00:09:43.235 --> 00:09:49.247
So already, as a culture,
I would say we all have clitoridectomies.

00:09:51.614 --> 00:09:54.749
'Clitoris, say my name, say my name.'

00:09:54.875 --> 00:09:56.993
I really enjoyed using word-play

00:09:57.044 --> 00:10:01.394
and putting the clitoris
into popular culture and song lyrics.

00:10:01.635 --> 00:10:06.992
So much of popular culture, music -
the female genitals are kind of riffed on

00:10:07.022 --> 00:10:09.462
but almost always in a negative way.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.849
If you want to humiliate a man,

00:10:12.096 --> 00:10:14.882
call him a word
for female genitals, right?

00:10:15.035 --> 00:10:18.150
But this is also an opportunity,
you can just pop in the clit,

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:20.859
and suddenly the whole song changes;
it's very powerful.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.610
So, this is a Destiny's Child song,

00:10:22.642 --> 00:10:25.091
there're many more
in the Laws of Cliteracy

00:10:25.111 --> 00:10:28.144
like 'Ain't no half-stepping to the clit,'

00:10:28.659 --> 00:10:31.004
'Sleeping on the clit? That shit cray',

00:10:31.019 --> 00:10:32.412
which it is.

00:10:34.751 --> 00:10:38.288
Here's an example from looking below
at the 100 Laws of Cliteracy.

00:10:38.308 --> 00:10:43.397
So this work spans 13 feet long
by 10 feet tall.

00:10:43.603 --> 00:10:45.344
It dwarfs anyone's body.

00:10:45.556 --> 00:10:48.943
When I first showed this work,
I had no idea what the response would be.

00:10:48.974 --> 00:10:51.225
Of course, I was hoping
it would be positive,

00:10:51.242 --> 00:10:52.355
but I didn't know.

00:10:52.375 --> 00:10:57.874
And I have to say, I was overwhelmed
with the way audiences responded.

00:10:57.895 --> 00:11:00.201
They really wanted
to have this conversation.

00:11:00.229 --> 00:11:02.702
They would stay with the work
for 15 minutes.

00:11:02.727 --> 00:11:04.827
I would come back,
they would still be there,

00:11:04.847 --> 00:11:06.469
they would have friends with them.

00:11:06.494 --> 00:11:09.298
And I felt like this work was needed.

00:11:09.615 --> 00:11:12.257
I was invited to speak about it a lot,

00:11:12.289 --> 00:11:14.848
and I was also contacted privately.

00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:16.526
People shared secrets with me,

00:11:16.557 --> 00:11:20.399
people told me for the first time
they didn't feel ashamed about their body,

00:11:20.424 --> 00:11:23.448
or they went home with this knowledge

00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:26.379
and are having a great time
with their girlfriend,

00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:28.149
and wanted to thank me for that.

00:11:28.179 --> 00:11:29.896
So this was extremely gratifying.

00:11:29.916 --> 00:11:33.645
I think for me, what made me feel
like I was onto something

00:11:33.663 --> 00:11:37.356
was that such a diverse group of people
supported this project:

00:11:37.825 --> 00:11:43.163
men and women, young and old,
religious and secular, queer and straight.

00:11:44.373 --> 00:11:47.795
So many people came together
to support this project.

00:11:48.044 --> 00:11:53.464
And I was contacted by people
from as far as New Zealand, Egypt, Brazil,

00:11:53.491 --> 00:11:56.206
saying: 'How can we help you
with this project?

00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:00.020
Can you translate this project
into Arabic or into Portuguese,

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:02.379
like, we need this here in our country.'

00:12:03.752 --> 00:12:08.505
I wanted Cliteracy to go everywhere,
but I didn't know how to do that yet,

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:10.235
and I'm still figuring that out.

00:12:10.252 --> 00:12:11.587
But I know that it's needed.

00:12:11.607 --> 00:12:14.839
And I know that it can't just stay
within the walls of the art world.

00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:19.982
I don't consider myself a street artist,
but I began making work on the street

00:12:19.997 --> 00:12:22.543
for the same reason
that I think a lot of artist do -

00:12:22.563 --> 00:12:24.862
I wanted to communicate more broadly.

00:12:28.515 --> 00:12:32.779
This is an example from a documentary
of just me putting up some pieces.

00:12:32.804 --> 00:12:35.541
These are prints
that I made on a news print,

00:12:35.551 --> 00:12:39.127
then I'm putting them up with wheat paste
just like old posters were put up.

00:12:39.287 --> 00:12:41.280
I'm just doing this in Brooklyn.

00:12:41.682 --> 00:12:44.384
Some people like to do street art
at the night time,

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:47.156
I do it in the day
because I feel like it's a little safer,

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.728
the anonymity of the crowd in New York.

00:12:49.883 --> 00:12:51.257
So far so good.

00:12:52.324 --> 00:12:54.606
And one of the cool things
about doing street art

00:12:54.646 --> 00:12:56.604
is that people will comment on your work.

00:12:56.614 --> 00:12:58.857
Sometimes they cross it out or destroy it,

00:12:58.877 --> 00:13:01.808
but other times
they put their art on top of it.

00:13:01.838 --> 00:13:03.849
And in this case that happened.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.588
Again, like when I showed
the work in the gallery,

00:13:06.608 --> 00:13:08.545
on the street there was a big response,

00:13:08.568 --> 00:13:09.851
people would photograph it,

00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:11.931
they would post it
on Twitter and Instagram.

00:13:11.944 --> 00:13:14.083
And it felt like I was talking
about something

00:13:14.093 --> 00:13:15.570
that needed to be talked about,

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.560
that the project was needed
and people were grateful to find it

00:13:18.689 --> 00:13:20.845
and to keep pushing it out there more.

00:13:23.741 --> 00:13:29.332
Doing the street work emboldened me
to take on even crazier ideas

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.822
that I never thought
I would find myself doing.

00:13:32.297 --> 00:13:38.322
And I actually, together with an artist
named Clit Eastwood, or Ken Thomas,

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.770
held the world's first-ever
clit rodeo last summer.

00:13:42.397 --> 00:13:45.317
We created a rideable golden clit.

00:13:45.347 --> 00:13:47.340
(Laughter)

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.196
And we held the first clit rodeo.

00:13:50.471 --> 00:13:53.469
And, you know, there
were two rules to the rodeo.

00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:55.958
Basically, one: respect the clit.

00:13:56.088 --> 00:13:57.188
Respect it.

00:13:57.219 --> 00:13:58.134
Two: have fun.

00:13:58.153 --> 00:13:59.714
Those were the rules.

00:13:59.946 --> 00:14:04.721
We had so many riders who wanted to ride,
more than we could host for our event.

00:14:04.833 --> 00:14:08.106
But the riders were judged
on three categories:

00:14:08.135 --> 00:14:11.392
dexterity, style and generosity.

00:14:11.652 --> 00:14:13.893
And they were really
good riders, I have to say.

00:14:13.923 --> 00:14:16.150
I was worried that it might
get a little boring

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.127
because as you saw on the previous slide,
it was just a spring.

00:14:19.147 --> 00:14:21.480
But people were reading
erotica to the clit,

00:14:21.522 --> 00:14:25.363
someone did a striptease for the clit,
someone surfed the clit,

00:14:25.392 --> 00:14:28.487
someone offered a cigarette to the clit,
and then, like -

00:14:28.509 --> 00:14:31.889
There was a couple where
the woman was nine-months-pregnant;

00:14:31.919 --> 00:14:32.928
she was riding,

00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:37.136
and her husband was in the background
as her backup dancer, dancing around ...

00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:40.425
So, it was way better
than I ever expected.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.161
I just was thrilled because
the clit was the star of the show.

00:14:45.185 --> 00:14:46.354
Finally!

00:14:49.262 --> 00:14:52.001
I've always wanted Cliteracy
to be in the public space,

00:14:52.025 --> 00:14:55.872
to be at large scale,
to be seen over time,

00:14:55.905 --> 00:14:58.297
not to have to be hidden away
or be a secret.

00:14:58.335 --> 00:15:00.934
And I had the opportunity last fall.

00:15:00.955 --> 00:15:06.234
Together with Center and Santa Fe we
put up a 35 feet billboard of Cliteracy,

00:15:06.273 --> 00:15:07.858
or 11 metre billboard.

00:15:07.998 --> 00:15:09.063
The text says:

00:15:09.093 --> 00:15:11.907
'Democracy without cliteracy - phallusy'.

00:15:12.223 --> 00:15:14.134
And I was thrilled to do this,

00:15:14.422 --> 00:15:16.630
especially because where it was
on this highway

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.643
is travelled by such
a broad range of people,

00:15:19.668 --> 00:15:25.913
from long-haul truck drivers
to art collectors and everyone in between.

00:15:26.229 --> 00:15:28.694
The billboard company
was a little bit less psyched

00:15:28.714 --> 00:15:31.195
about how much feedback
they got about the billboard,

00:15:31.225 --> 00:15:32.613
but I thought this was great.

00:15:32.643 --> 00:15:34.927
A lot of people were like:
'What are you selling?

00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:36.273
I don't understand.'

00:15:37.573 --> 00:15:41.479
I actually got a call that I'll never
forget from a mom, saying:

00:15:41.708 --> 00:15:44.129
'I have to drive this route
with my son every day,

00:15:44.165 --> 00:15:46.405
and I don't know what to tell him.'

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.414
But I was thrilled because she's going
to talk to him about cliteracy,

00:15:51.434 --> 00:15:53.815
and this is something
that he needs to know about.

00:15:55.995 --> 00:15:58.072
Cliteracy needs more than text though,

00:15:58.092 --> 00:16:00.906
and I always knew that
I wanted to explore the form as well.

00:16:00.936 --> 00:16:03.974
None of us know this form, right?
I didn't know this form.

00:16:04.136 --> 00:16:05.383
So I set about making

00:16:05.383 --> 00:16:09.175
the world's first anatomically correct
sculpture of the clitoris.

00:16:09.209 --> 00:16:11.877
And this was something
that was actually quite hard to do

00:16:11.897 --> 00:16:14.973
because there are so few accurate
representations of the anatomy.

00:16:14.993 --> 00:16:19.930
And when you find
these very few drawings or scans,

00:16:19.961 --> 00:16:22.996
they contradict each other,
they don't make sense.

00:16:23.194 --> 00:16:27.978
So, it was actually not that easy to do,
but I set about making this form.

00:16:30.877 --> 00:16:36.373
With the form I wanted to not only
explore the anatomy and get it accurate,

00:16:36.406 --> 00:16:41.268
but I also wanted to show
the gesture of beauty of this organ

00:16:41.309 --> 00:16:43.287
and the gracefulness of it.

00:16:47.359 --> 00:16:51.684
Here is the first sculpture that I know of
of the anatomically correct clitoris.

00:16:51.712 --> 00:16:55.175
It's six feet tall and five feet wide.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.373
And I wanted to create an iconic form

00:17:00.215 --> 00:17:03.968
of this unseen organ half of us have,

00:17:03.996 --> 00:17:07.429
all of us were born through the body
of someone that has a clitoris.

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:11.199
Everyone in this room was born through
the body of someone that has a clitoris.

00:17:11.229 --> 00:17:13.427
So all of us have been touched
by the clitoris.

00:17:13.447 --> 00:17:15.755
This is universal
and yet we don't know about it.

00:17:15.775 --> 00:17:18.359
So I wanted to create
an iconic form that's memorable,

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.850
that puts this into our consciousness.

00:17:22.605 --> 00:17:26.250
And I hope that finally this form
would be treated with honour and respect

00:17:26.278 --> 00:17:28.127
and not be treated as obscene.

00:17:28.151 --> 00:17:29.631
I think it's a beautiful form,

00:17:29.661 --> 00:17:31.758
and I didn't know it,

00:17:31.778 --> 00:17:34.638
but once I saw it,
it started to feel familiar in this way.

00:17:34.667 --> 00:17:38.470
And I started to see it around
in the natural world, in plants.

00:17:38.496 --> 00:17:41.800
I also saw it in engravings,
on architectural sites.

00:17:41.837 --> 00:17:44.665
I saw it in weavings
of oriental tapestries.

00:17:44.695 --> 00:17:46.272
I started to see it around.

00:17:46.292 --> 00:17:48.321
And that was very exciting.

00:17:48.425 --> 00:17:51.550
And the form is interesting
not strictly as a sculpture,

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.376
but in patterns.

00:17:54.617 --> 00:17:56.095
There's something very exciting

00:17:56.115 --> 00:18:00.063
about looking into the power of the small,
the power of multiplicity.

00:18:00.087 --> 00:18:03.777
Instead of creating just
this singular superior object,

00:18:03.813 --> 00:18:06.153
what about putting
all these tiny beautiful forms

00:18:06.193 --> 00:18:09.055
that together form a baby-clit army.

00:18:09.078 --> 00:18:10.626
The one on the right,

00:18:10.656 --> 00:18:11.655
(Laughter)

00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:13.298
I call it 'Fleur-de-clits',

00:18:13.318 --> 00:18:16.876
and the one on the left
was later used in the intervention

00:18:16.906 --> 00:18:18.477
at the Whitney Museum.

00:18:19.376 --> 00:18:22.581
So here's a sort of subversive
clit army coming together

00:18:22.601 --> 00:18:25.524
to make the 'Fleur-de-clit',
which is this beautiful pattern.

00:18:25.552 --> 00:18:27.945
But unfortunately,
if some people knew what it was,

00:18:27.975 --> 00:18:29.363
it wouldn't be allowed to be.

00:18:29.383 --> 00:18:32.011
And that's sort of the rub of it.

00:18:32.671 --> 00:18:36.690
Here is an example of more
clit forms and patterns that I created.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.773
This is a clit damask pattern

00:18:38.787 --> 00:18:42.934
with clit forms burnished onto wood.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.275
On the left is a new sculpture.

00:18:45.807 --> 00:18:49.123
So, this is the first sketch
of an invisible clit sculpture.

00:18:49.148 --> 00:18:50.804
It's the same digital form

00:18:50.823 --> 00:18:53.632
that I used to make the gold sculpture
I just showed to you.

00:18:53.653 --> 00:18:55.585
But this exists in the negative space.

00:18:55.615 --> 00:18:58.586
So I used the laser
to actually cut out the form

00:18:58.622 --> 00:19:00.277
from clear plexiglass.

00:19:00.297 --> 00:19:04.512
And so this invisible sculpture
addresses the fact

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:09.004
that this is omnipresent,
and yet it's negated, it's invisible,

00:19:09.034 --> 00:19:11.118
it's not allowed to be spoken of.

00:19:12.559 --> 00:19:15.383
I also continued
with this idea of negation

00:19:15.406 --> 00:19:17.653
and using the laser to burn away

00:19:17.676 --> 00:19:19.968
with laser-cut works on paper.

00:19:22.424 --> 00:19:25.270
And I developed a brand new technology.

00:19:25.306 --> 00:19:27.251
You might not have heard about it,

00:19:27.282 --> 00:19:28.601
but it's very cutting edge.

00:19:28.631 --> 00:19:30.169
I'll try to explain.

00:19:30.321 --> 00:19:33.729
It's called 'clitglass',
and the way that it works -

00:19:33.749 --> 00:19:35.103
anyone can wear it;

00:19:35.128 --> 00:19:39.267
anyone who wants neutral vision
can wear a clitglass.

00:19:39.287 --> 00:19:41.652
So you put on the clitglass,

00:19:41.985 --> 00:19:44.823
and you look through
the perspective of the clit.

00:19:44.955 --> 00:19:48.888
And the clit refracts
any kind of phallocentricacy

00:19:48.918 --> 00:19:50.218
that's coming back at you.

00:19:50.251 --> 00:19:54.364
And so you obtain neutral vision,
or what I like to call 'normal' vision.

00:19:54.387 --> 00:19:55.397
(Laughter)

00:19:55.435 --> 00:19:59.792
Now, you can use clitglass
at the Whitney Museum,

00:19:59.807 --> 00:20:02.280
or you can use it at work,
in front of the TV,

00:20:02.305 --> 00:20:04.197
even at a family reunion.

00:20:04.227 --> 00:20:05.648
(Laughter)

00:20:05.674 --> 00:20:09.542
This is an example of looking through
this cutting edge technology.

00:20:11.581 --> 00:20:13.497
So those forms that I showed earlier,

00:20:13.519 --> 00:20:17.114
I also played a game at my intervention
at the Whitney Museum,

00:20:17.148 --> 00:20:20.056
called 'put a clit on it', or -

00:20:20.415 --> 00:20:22.022
'clit-dazzle the Whitney'.

00:20:22.052 --> 00:20:26.190
So basically I handed out
these unknown clit forms, and I said:

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.621
'Put the clit wherever
you think it needs to go -

00:20:28.647 --> 00:20:30.569
put it as a subject in art history,

00:20:30.601 --> 00:20:33.387
put into the designs,
put it on the American flag.

00:20:33.417 --> 00:20:35.582
Whole country has a problem
with illcliteracy.

00:20:35.602 --> 00:20:36.609
Help America out.

00:20:36.639 --> 00:20:38.591
Just take the clit where it needs to go.'

00:20:38.626 --> 00:20:43.271
So you can see on the lower left,
that's a Clitchtenstein.

00:20:44.333 --> 00:20:47.114
On the lower right, Clitsper Johns.

00:20:49.303 --> 00:20:52.356
This is the family at the Whitney Museum
during the intervention,

00:20:52.396 --> 00:20:55.750
and the boy on the left
who looks to be about 11 years old,

00:20:55.777 --> 00:20:57.209
at one point asks his mom -

00:20:57.226 --> 00:21:00.936
they'd been wearing the clitglasses
for about 15 minutes, having a great time.

00:21:00.936 --> 00:21:02.608
He was like, 'Mom, what's a clit?'

00:21:02.628 --> 00:21:04.364
(Laughter)

00:21:04.394 --> 00:21:08.006
And she said: 'Oh, it's a really sensitive
part of the woman's body.'

00:21:08.031 --> 00:21:10.094
And he was like, 'Okay, cool.'

00:21:10.505 --> 00:21:12.396
And I was thrilled because

00:21:12.425 --> 00:21:15.050
one: he felt comfortable
asking the question;

00:21:15.073 --> 00:21:17.849
two: his mom was supportive
and answered the question.

00:21:17.869 --> 00:21:21.029
And it was totally normal -
nothing obscene, nothing secret,

00:21:21.059 --> 00:21:25.079
no one had to be dragged out of the room,
no one had to be ashamed.

00:21:25.464 --> 00:21:28.766
And that's what I'm hoping
that Cliteracy can continue to do.

00:21:30.287 --> 00:21:34.072
Overwhelmingly, the response
to Cliteracy has been positive.

00:21:34.095 --> 00:21:37.981
So many people have supported the project
and wanted to help with it.

00:21:38.002 --> 00:21:41.859
And there've been a few institutions
who have courageously started showing it.

00:21:42.034 --> 00:21:44.636
But there's so much more
that needs to be done.

00:21:47.486 --> 00:21:51.854
My dream is to radically change
the way that we think about bodies

00:21:51.868 --> 00:21:54.312
so that everyone's body is respected.

00:21:54.599 --> 00:21:58.901
I want to do this by creating
large scale permanent public sculptures

00:21:58.924 --> 00:22:01.779
that exist for thousands of years.

00:22:01.804 --> 00:22:04.274
I want to work with metals and stone

00:22:04.307 --> 00:22:07.317
so that these forms don't disappear
in future generations,

00:22:07.341 --> 00:22:10.868
and we don't have to have
this conversation again and again.

00:22:12.978 --> 00:22:17.041
Democracy without cliteracy is a phallusy.

00:22:19.564 --> 00:22:22.610
I want cliteracy to be taught in schools

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:27.548
so that no child has
an unnameable part of their body.

00:22:27.995 --> 00:22:31.697
The clit should be a starring role
in any bedroom that it's in.

00:22:32.161 --> 00:22:34.841
And it shouldn't be censored
in the Parliament.

00:22:36.918 --> 00:22:40.037
So, in closing, I want to ask you

00:22:40.284 --> 00:22:41.792
to see the clit.

00:22:42.366 --> 00:22:43.891
See it everywhere.

00:22:44.304 --> 00:22:45.885
Don't stop seeing it.

00:22:46.102 --> 00:22:47.702
And if you need help,

00:22:48.873 --> 00:22:51.555
you can borrow
this pair of glasses from me.

00:22:52.614 --> 00:22:55.309
And don't just stop with seeing it.

00:22:55.348 --> 00:22:58.144
Say it. Say its name.

00:23:00.744 --> 00:23:03.514
(Applause) (Cheers)

00:23:03.544 --> 00:23:04.620
Thank you.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.410
(Applause)
