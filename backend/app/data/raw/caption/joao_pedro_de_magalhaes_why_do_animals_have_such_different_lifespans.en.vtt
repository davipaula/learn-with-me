00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:11.276
For the microscopic lab worm, C. elegans

00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:15.185
life equates to just 
a few short weeks on Earth.

00:00:15.185 --> 00:00:20.051
Compare that with the tortoise,
which can age to more than 100 years.

00:00:20.051 --> 00:00:24.415
Mice and rats reach the end of their lives
after just four years,

00:00:24.415 --> 00:00:28.141
while for the bowhead whale,
Earth's longest-lived mammal,

00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:31.639
death can come after 200.

00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:33.190
Like most living things,

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.420
the vast majority of animals gradually
degenerate after reaching sexual maturity

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.327
in the process known as aging.

00:00:41.327 --> 00:00:44.176
But what does it really mean to age?

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:48.036
The drivers behind this process are varied
and complicated,

00:00:48.036 --> 00:00:52.930
but aging is ultimately 
caused by cell death and dysfunction.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.707
When we're young, 
we constantly regenerate cells

00:00:55.707 --> 00:00:59.067
in order to replace dead and dying ones.

00:00:59.067 --> 00:01:01.835
But as we age, this process slows down.

00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:07.277
In addition, older cells don't perform
their functions as well as young ones.

00:01:07.277 --> 00:01:09.666
That makes our bodies go into a decline,

00:01:09.666 --> 00:01:12.967
which eventually results 
in disease and death.

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:15.637
But if that's consistently true,

00:01:15.637 --> 00:01:21.288
why the huge variance in aging patterns
and lifespan within the animal kingdom?

00:01:21.288 --> 00:01:23.607
The answer lies in several factors,

00:01:23.607 --> 00:01:24.937
including environment

00:01:24.937 --> 00:01:27.187
and body size.

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:31.368
These can place powerful evolutionary
pressures on animals to adapt,

00:01:31.368 --> 00:01:36.158
which in turn makes the aging process
different across species.

00:01:36.158 --> 00:01:39.959
Consider the cold depths of the Atlantic
and Arctic Seas,

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:43.328
where Greenland sharks can live
to over 400 years,

00:01:43.328 --> 00:01:48.488
and the Arctic clam known as the quahog
can live up to 500.

00:01:48.488 --> 00:01:51.429
Perhaps the most impressive of these
ocean-dwelling ancients

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:54.047
is the Antarctic glass sponge,

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:58.388
which can survive over 10,000 years
in frigid waters.

00:01:58.388 --> 00:02:03.828
In cold environments like these,
heartbeats and metabolic rates slow down.

00:02:03.828 --> 00:02:08.769
Researchers theorize that this also
causes a slowing of the aging process.

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.159
In this way, the environment 
shapes longevity.

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:15.799
When it comes to size, 
it's often, but not always,

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:21.159
the case that larger species have a longer
lifespan than smaller ones.

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.199
For instance, an elephant or whale
will live much longer

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.498
than a mouse, rat, or vole,

00:02:26.498 --> 00:02:31.430
which in turn have years on flies
and worms.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.820
Some small animals, like worms and flies,

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.650
are also limited by the mechanics 
of their cell division.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.061
They're mostly made up of cells that can't
divide and be replaced when damaged,

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:45.090
so their bodies expire more quickly.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.180
And size is a powerful evolutionary driver
in animals.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.020
Smaller creatures are more prone
to predators.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.961
A mouse, for instance, can hardly expect
to survive more than a year in the wild.

00:02:56.961 --> 00:03:00.810
So, it has evolved to grow and reproduce
more rapidly,

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.551
like an evolutionary defense mechanism
against its shorter lifespan.

00:03:05.551 --> 00:03:09.520
Larger animals, by contrast, are better
at fending off predators,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.901
and so they have the luxury of time
to grow to large sizes

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:16.232
and reproduce multiple times
during their lives.

00:03:16.232 --> 00:03:22.672
Exceptions to the size rule include bats,
birds, moles, and turtles,

00:03:22.672 --> 00:03:25.537
but in each case, these animals have other
adaptations

00:03:25.537 --> 00:03:29.231
that allow them to escape predators.

00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:32.771
But there are still cases where animals
with similar defining features,

00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:34.791
like size and habitat,

00:03:34.791 --> 00:03:37.791
age at completely different rates.

00:03:37.791 --> 00:03:39.891
In these cases, genetic differences,

00:03:39.891 --> 00:03:43.261
like how each organism's cells
respond to threats,

00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:47.553
often account for the discrepancies
in longevity.

00:03:47.553 --> 00:03:49.902
So it's the combination 
of all these factors

00:03:49.902 --> 00:03:52.912
playing out to differing degrees
in different animals

00:03:52.912 --> 00:03:57.733
that explains the variability we see
in the animal kingdom.

00:03:57.733 --> 00:03:59.703
So what about us?

00:03:59.703 --> 00:04:03.772
Humans currently have 
an average life expectancy of 71 years,

00:04:03.772 --> 00:04:08.862
meaning that we're not even close to being
the longest living inhabitants on Earth.

00:04:08.862 --> 00:04:13.041
But we are very good at increasing
our life expectancy.

00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:17.898
In the early 1900s, humans only lived
an average of 50 years.

00:04:17.898 --> 00:04:21.712
Since then, we've learned to adapt
by managing many of the factors

00:04:21.712 --> 00:04:23.072
that cause deaths,

00:04:23.072 --> 00:04:26.403
like environmental exposure
and nutrition.

00:04:26.403 --> 00:04:29.053
This, and other increases 
in life expectancy

00:04:29.053 --> 00:04:32.033
make us possibly the only species
on Earth

00:04:32.033 --> 00:04:35.093
to take control over our natural fate.
