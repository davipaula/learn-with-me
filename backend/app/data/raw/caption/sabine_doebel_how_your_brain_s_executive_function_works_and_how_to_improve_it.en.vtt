00:00:12.708 --> 00:00:15.559
So I have a confession to make.

00:00:15.583 --> 00:00:17.875
I only recently learned how to drive.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.292
And it was really hard.

00:00:21.125 --> 00:00:24.184
Now, this wasn't an older brain thing.

00:00:24.208 --> 00:00:27.476
Do you remember what it was like
when you first learned how to drive?

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.458
When every decision you made
was so conscious and deliberate?

00:00:31.208 --> 00:00:34.667
I'd come home from my lessons
completely wiped out mentally.

00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:38.893
Now, as a cognitive scientist
I know that this is because I was using

00:00:38.917 --> 00:00:42.708
a lot of something
called executive function.

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:48.768
Executive function is our amazing ability
to consciously control our thoughts,

00:00:48.792 --> 00:00:50.601
emotions and actions

00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:52.643
in order to achieve goals ...

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:54.250
like learning how to drive.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.018
It's what we use when we need
to break away from habit,

00:00:58.042 --> 00:01:00.542
inhibit our impulses and plan ahead.

00:01:01.708 --> 00:01:04.500
But we can see it most clearly
when things go wrong.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.643
Like, have you ever accidentally
poured orange juice on your cereal?

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:10.726
(Laughter)

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.643
Or, ever start scrolling on Facebook

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:14.809
and suddenly realize
you've missed a meeting?

00:01:14.833 --> 00:01:16.143
(Laughter)

00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:17.809
Or maybe this one's more familiar:

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:20.518
Ever plan to stop at the store
on the way home from work

00:01:20.542 --> 00:01:23.393
and then drive all the way home
instead on autopilot?

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:25.601
(Laughter)

00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:28.018
These things happen to everyone.

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:29.976
And we usually call it absentmindedness,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.309
but what's really happening

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.458
is we're experiencing a lapse
in executive function.

00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:40.018
So we use executive function
every day in all aspects of our lives.

00:01:40.042 --> 00:01:41.476
And over the past 30 years,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.268
researchers have found
that it predicts all kinds of good things

00:01:45.292 --> 00:01:47.476
in childhood and beyond,

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.059
like social skills, academic achievement,
mental and physical health,

00:01:52.083 --> 00:01:54.101
making money, saving money

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:56.268
and even staying out of jail.

00:01:56.292 --> 00:01:58.309
Sounds great, doesn't it?

00:01:58.333 --> 00:01:59.768
So it's no surprise

00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:03.226
that researchers like me
are so interested in understanding it

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.458
and figuring out ways to improve it.

00:02:07.167 --> 00:02:12.333
But lately, executive function has become
a huge self-improvement buzzword.

00:02:13.042 --> 00:02:16.393
People think you can improve it
through brain-training iPhone apps

00:02:16.417 --> 00:02:17.851
and computer games,

00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:21.125
or by practicing it in a specific way,
like playing chess.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.309
And researchers are trying
to train it in the lab

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:28.268
in the hopes of improving it
and other things related to it,

00:02:28.292 --> 00:02:29.583
like intelligence.

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:32.809
Well, I'm here to tell you

00:02:32.833 --> 00:02:36.768
that this way of thinking
about executive function is all wrong.

00:02:36.792 --> 00:02:40.351
Brain training won't improve
executive function in a broad sense

00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:43.601
because it involves
exercising it in a narrow way,

00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:48.042
outside of the real-world contexts
in which we actually use it.

00:02:48.875 --> 00:02:51.726
So you can master that executive
function app on your phone,

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.524
but that's not going to help you stop
pouring OJ on your Cheeerios twice a week.

00:02:55.538 --> 00:02:56.643
(Laughter)

00:02:56.667 --> 00:02:59.184
If you really want to improve
your executive function

00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:01.393
in a way that matters for your life,

00:03:01.417 --> 00:03:05.167
you have to understand
how it's influenced by context.

00:03:06.083 --> 00:03:07.684
Let me show you what I mean.

00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:10.059
There's a great test
that we use in the lab

00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:12.309
to measure executive function
in young children

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:14.917
called the "dimensional change card sort."

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.434
In this task, kids have to sort
cards in one way --

00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:20.976
like by shape --

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.768
over and over until they build up a habit.

00:03:23.792 --> 00:03:25.976
And then they're asked to switch

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.851
and sort the same cards in another way,

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:30.208
like by color.

00:03:31.083 --> 00:03:34.309
Now, really young kids struggle with this.

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:37.934
Three- and four-year-olds will usually
keep sorting the cards in the old way

00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:41.333
no matter how many times you remind
them of what they should be doing.

00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:45.309
(Video) Woman: If it's blue, put it here.
If it's red, put it here.

00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:46.583
Here's a blue one.

00:03:47.083 --> 00:03:49.351
OK, so now we're going to play
a different game.

00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:51.601
We're not going to play
the color game anymore.

00:03:51.625 --> 00:03:53.518
Now we're going to play the shape game,

00:03:53.542 --> 00:03:54.809
and in the shape game,

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:58.059
all the stars go here
and all the trucks go here, OK?

00:03:58.083 --> 00:04:00.143
Stars go here, trucks go here.

00:04:00.167 --> 00:04:01.458
Where do the stars go?

00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:04.226
And where do the trucks go?

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.518
Excellent.

00:04:05.542 --> 00:04:07.851
OK, stars go here, trucks go here.

00:04:07.875 --> 00:04:09.125
Here's a truck.

00:04:10.542 --> 00:04:12.351
(Laughter)

00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:14.643
Stars go here, trucks go here.

00:04:14.667 --> 00:04:15.917
Here's a star.

00:04:17.208 --> 00:04:19.559
(Laughter)

00:04:19.583 --> 00:04:21.476
SB: So it's really compelling,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.601
and it's really obvious when she fails
to use her executive function.

00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:26.893
But here's the thing:

00:04:26.917 --> 00:04:29.642
we could train her on this task
and others like it

00:04:29.666 --> 00:04:31.684
and eventually she'd improve,

00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:32.976
but does that mean

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.268
that she would've improved
her executive function outside of the lab?

00:04:36.292 --> 00:04:39.726
No, because in the real world,
she'll need to use executive function

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.226
to do a lot more than switching
between shape and color.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.226
She'll need to switch
from adding to multiplying

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.518
or from playing to tidying up

00:04:48.542 --> 00:04:52.393
or from thinking about her own feelings
to thinking about her friend.

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:55.393
And success in real-world situations
depends on things

00:04:55.417 --> 00:04:59.226
like how motivated you are
and what your peers are doing.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.351
And it also depends
on the strategies that you execute

00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:05.625
when you're using executive function
in a particular situation.

00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:10.375
So what I'm saying is
that context really matters.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.976
Now let me give you an example
from my research.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.393
I recently brought in a bunch of kids
to do the classic marshmallow test,

00:05:18.417 --> 00:05:20.601
which is a measure
of delay of gratification

00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:23.750
that also likely requires
a lot of executive function.

00:05:24.708 --> 00:05:26.559
So you may have heard about this test,

00:05:26.583 --> 00:05:28.601
but basically, kids are given a choice.

00:05:28.625 --> 00:05:30.934
They can have one marshmallow right away,

00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:33.351
or if they can wait for me
to go to the other room

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:34.893
and get more marshmallows,

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:36.708
they can have two instead.

00:05:37.417 --> 00:05:41.434
Now, most kids really want
that second marshmallow,

00:05:41.458 --> 00:05:44.684
but the key question is:
How long can they wait?

00:05:44.708 --> 00:05:45.809
(Laughter)

00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:49.833
Now, I added a twist
to look at the effects of context.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.726
I told each kid that they were in a group,

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.393
like the green group,

00:05:55.417 --> 00:05:58.559
and I even gave them
a green T-shirt to wear.

00:05:58.583 --> 00:06:02.684
And I said, "Your group
waited for two marshmallows,

00:06:02.708 --> 00:06:05.059
and this other group, the orange group,

00:06:05.083 --> 00:06:06.351
did not."

00:06:06.375 --> 00:06:07.851
Or I said the opposite:

00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:09.934
"Your group didn't wait
for two marshmallows

00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.018
and this other group did."

00:06:12.042 --> 00:06:14.351
And then I left the kid alone in the room

00:06:14.375 --> 00:06:17.208
and I watched on a webcam
to see how long they waited.

00:06:17.792 --> 00:06:21.851
(Laughter)

00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:25.643
So what I found was that kids who believed

00:06:25.667 --> 00:06:27.809
that their group waited
for two marshmallows

00:06:27.833 --> 00:06:30.667
were themselves more likely to wait.

00:06:32.042 --> 00:06:36.476
So they were influenced by a peer group
that they'd never even met.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.893
(Laughter)

00:06:37.917 --> 00:06:39.601
Pretty cool, isn't it?

00:06:39.625 --> 00:06:42.226
Well, so with this result
I still didn't know

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.750
if they were just copying their group
or if it was something deeper than that.

00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:49.018
So I brought in some more kids,

00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:54.059
and after the marshmallow test,
I showed them pictures of pairs of kids,

00:06:54.083 --> 00:06:57.768
and I told them, "One of these kids
likes to have things right away,

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:59.768
like cookies and stickers.

00:06:59.792 --> 00:07:01.309
And the other kid likes to wait

00:07:01.333 --> 00:07:03.809
so that they can have
more of these things."

00:07:03.833 --> 00:07:05.101
And then I asked them,

00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:07.268
"Which one of these two kids
do you like more

00:07:07.292 --> 00:07:09.083
and who would you want to play with?"

00:07:09.833 --> 00:07:13.684
And what I found was that kids
who believed that their group waited

00:07:13.708 --> 00:07:17.125
tended to prefer other kids
who liked to wait for things.

00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:22.083
So learning what their group did
made them value waiting more.

00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:24.726
And not only that,

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.059
these kids likely used executive function

00:07:27.083 --> 00:07:30.143
to generate strategies
to help themselves wait,

00:07:30.167 --> 00:07:33.643
like sitting on their hands
or turning away from the marshmallow

00:07:33.667 --> 00:07:36.768
or singing a song to distract themselves.

00:07:36.792 --> 00:07:38.417
(Laughter)

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.059
So what this all shows
is just how much context matters.

00:07:44.083 --> 00:07:47.643
It's not that these kids
had good executive function or bad,

00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:50.667
it's that the context
helped them use it better.

00:07:52.417 --> 00:07:55.542
So what does this mean
for you and for your kids?

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.143
Well, let's say that you want
to learn Spanish.

00:07:59.167 --> 00:08:00.893
You could try changing your context

00:08:00.917 --> 00:08:04.851
and surrounding yourself
with other people who also want to learn,

00:08:04.875 --> 00:08:07.893
and even better if these are people
that you really like.

00:08:07.917 --> 00:08:11.333
That way you'll be more motivated
to use executive function.

00:08:12.167 --> 00:08:16.434
Or let's say that you want to help
your child do better on her math homework.

00:08:16.458 --> 00:08:19.601
You could teach her strategies
to use executive function

00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:21.559
in that particular context,

00:08:21.583 --> 00:08:24.726
like putting her phone away
before she starts studying

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:28.333
or planning to reward herself
after studying for an hour.

00:08:29.083 --> 00:08:32.351
Now, I don't want to make it sound
like context is everything.

00:08:32.375 --> 00:08:37.351
Executive function is really complex,
and it's shaped by numerous factors.

00:08:37.375 --> 00:08:38.893
But what I want you to remember

00:08:38.917 --> 00:08:41.434
is if you want to improve
your executive function

00:08:41.458 --> 00:08:43.809
in some aspect of your life,

00:08:43.833 --> 00:08:45.976
don't look for quick fixes.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.268
Think about the context

00:08:47.292 --> 00:08:50.226
and how you can make
your goals matter more to you,

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:51.726
and how you can use strategies

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.125
to help yourself
in that particular situation.

00:08:55.332 --> 00:09:00.726
I think the ancient Greeks said it best
when they said, "Know thyself."

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:05.059
And a key part of this is knowing
how context shapes your behavior

00:09:05.083 --> 00:09:08.893
and how you can use that knowledge
to change for the better.

00:09:08.917 --> 00:09:10.184
Thank you.

00:09:10.208 --> 00:09:13.333
(Applause)
