00:00:06.688 --> 00:00:09.778
Imagine two people are listening to music.

00:00:09.778 --> 00:00:10.615
What are the odds

00:00:10.615 --> 00:00:11.375
that they are listening

00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:13.180
to the exact same playlist?

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.783
Probably pretty low.

00:00:14.783 --> 00:00:18.370
After all, everyone has very different tastes in music.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.735
Now, what are the odds

00:00:19.735 --> 00:00:20.921
that your body will need

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:23.154
the exact same medical care and treatment

00:00:23.154 --> 00:00:24.924
as another person's body?

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:26.301
Even lower.

00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:27.772
As we go through our lives,

00:00:27.772 --> 00:00:29.763
each of us will have very different needs

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:31.806
for our own healthcare.

00:00:31.806 --> 00:00:34.439
Scientists and doctors are constantly researching ways

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:37.005
to make medicine more personalized.

00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:39.031
One way they are doing this

00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:41.644
is by researching stem cells.

00:00:41.644 --> 00:00:45.034
Stem cells are cells that are undifferentiated,

00:00:45.034 --> 00:00:48.560
meaning they do not have a specific job or function.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.644
While skin cells protect your body,

00:00:50.644 --> 00:00:52.358
muscle cells contract,

00:00:52.358 --> 00:00:54.485
and nerve cells send signals,

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:58.915
stem cells do not have any specific structures or functions.

00:00:58.915 --> 00:01:00.908
Stem cells do have the potential

00:01:00.908 --> 00:01:04.264
to become all other kinds of cells in your body.

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:05.842
Your body uses stem cells

00:01:05.842 --> 00:01:08.759
to replace worn-out cells when they die.

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.209
For example, you completely replace

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:14.556
the lining of your intestines every four days.

00:01:14.556 --> 00:01:16.808
Stem cells beneath the lining of your intestines

00:01:16.808 --> 00:01:19.719
replace these cells as they wear out.

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:22.971
Scientists hope that stem cells could be used

00:01:22.971 --> 00:01:26.512
to create a very special kind of personalized medicine

00:01:26.512 --> 00:01:29.691
in which we could replace your own body parts with,

00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:32.188
well, your own body parts.

00:01:32.188 --> 00:01:34.628
Stem cell researchers are working hard

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:36.696
to find ways in which to use stem cells

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:38.196
to create new tissue

00:01:38.196 --> 00:01:39.572
to replace the parts of organs

00:01:39.572 --> 00:01:43.118
that are damaged by injury or disease.

00:01:43.118 --> 00:01:45.962
Using stem cells to replace damaged bodily tissue

00:01:45.962 --> 00:01:48.675
is called regenerative medicine.

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:51.907
For example, scientists currently use stem cells

00:01:51.907 --> 00:01:53.799
to treat patients with blood diseases

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.911
such as leukemia.

00:01:55.911 --> 00:01:57.799
Leukemia is a form of cancer

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.051
that affects your bone marrow.

00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:03.109
Bone marrow is the spongy tissue inside your bones

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.383
where your blood cells are created.

00:02:05.383 --> 00:02:08.903
In leukemia, some of the cells inside your bone marrow

00:02:08.903 --> 00:02:12.652
grow uncontrollably, crowding out the healthy stem cells

00:02:12.652 --> 00:02:14.865
that form your blood cells.

00:02:14.865 --> 00:02:16.991
Some leukemia patients can receive

00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:19.069
a stem cell transplant.

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.753
These new stem cells will create

00:02:20.753 --> 00:02:24.041
the blood cells needed by the patient's body.

00:02:24.041 --> 00:02:25.558
There are actually multiple kinds

00:02:25.558 --> 00:02:27.288
of stem cells that scientists can use

00:02:27.288 --> 00:02:29.623
for medical treatments and research.

00:02:29.623 --> 00:02:32.913
Adult stem cells or tissue-specific stem cells

00:02:32.913 --> 00:02:34.710
are found in small numbers

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.046
in most of your body's tissues.

00:02:37.046 --> 00:02:39.180
Tissue-specific stem cells replace

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.180
the existing cells in your organs

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.433
as they wear out and die.

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:45.676
Embryonic stem cells are created

00:02:45.676 --> 00:02:48.827
from leftover embryos that are willingly donated

00:02:48.827 --> 00:02:51.444
by patients from fertility clinics.

00:02:51.444 --> 00:02:53.867
Unlike tissue-specific stem cells,

00:02:53.867 --> 00:02:57.145
embryonic stem cells are pluripotent.

00:02:57.145 --> 00:02:58.524
This means that they can be grown

00:02:58.524 --> 00:03:01.430
into any kind of tissue in the body.

00:03:02.168 --> 00:03:03.782
A third kind of stem cells

00:03:03.782 --> 00:03:07.240
is called induced pluripotent stem cells.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.988
These are regular skin, fat, liver, or other cells

00:03:10.988 --> 00:03:12.156
that scientists have changed

00:03:12.156 --> 00:03:15.146
to behave like embryonic stem cells.

00:03:15.146 --> 00:03:17.450
Like embryonic stem cells,

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.401
they, too, can become any kind of cell in the body.

00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:22.409
While scientists and doctors hope to use

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.218
all of these kinds of stem cells

00:03:24.218 --> 00:03:26.825
to create new tissue to heal your body,

00:03:26.825 --> 00:03:28.597
they can also use stem cells

00:03:28.597 --> 00:03:32.134
to help understand how the body works.

00:03:32.134 --> 00:03:34.640
Scientists can watch stem cells develop

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.908
into tissue to understand the mechnanisms

00:03:36.908 --> 00:03:39.941
that the body uses to create new tissue

00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:42.656
in a controlled and regulated way.

00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:44.996
Scientists hope that with more research,

00:03:44.996 --> 00:03:47.329
they can not only develop specialized medicine

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.239
that is specific to your body

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.036
but also better understand

00:03:51.036 --> 00:03:52.294
how your body functions,

00:03:52.294 --> 00:03:53.788
both when it's healthy

00:03:53.788 --> 00:03:55.404
and when it's not.
