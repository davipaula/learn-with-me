00:00:15.222 --> 00:00:21.059
(Music)

00:00:31.334 --> 00:00:33.103
Sun shining up above

00:00:35.406 --> 00:00:38.197
down here it's 10 below

00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:47.299
I'm moving on to a place now

00:00:48.142 --> 00:00:51.481
where the streets are paved with gold

00:00:55.962 --> 00:00:58.801
There'll be two trains running --

00:01:00.648 --> 00:01:02.823
running side by side

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.617
Some trains are going out

00:01:14.244 --> 00:01:16.799
Two trains running --

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:21.188
running side by side

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:28.375
I'm going to catch that fast express train

00:01:28.818 --> 00:01:31.882
to my reward in the sky

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.451
Many rooms in my father's house now --

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:43.758
Oh Lord there's one for you and me

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.197
Many rooms in my father's house now --

00:01:51.553 --> 00:01:54.712
Oh there's one for you and me

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.780
No blues and no trouble

00:02:02.804 --> 00:02:05.729
Oh my Lord sweet Jesus victory

00:02:11.188 --> 00:02:14.174
There's one glory from the moon --

00:02:14.198 --> 00:02:20.479
Lord another, oh another from the sun

00:02:20.503 --> 00:02:23.851
Oh one glory from the moon

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:27.629
and another from the sun

00:02:32.098 --> 00:02:34.939
Behind I'll leave this earthly body

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.391
when my Lord king Jesus comes

00:02:49.095 --> 00:02:50.246
Thank you very much.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.467
(Applause)
