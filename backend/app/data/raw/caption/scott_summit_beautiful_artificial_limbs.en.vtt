Reviewer: Camille MartÃ­nez

00:00:14.335 --> 00:00:15.667
I'm an industrial designer,

00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:17.728
which means I create all these cool things

00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:20.911
from ideas that we surround ourselves
with, or in this case,

00:00:20.935 --> 00:00:23.641
geeky people surround themselves
with, for the most part.

00:00:23.665 --> 00:00:28.043
I have absolutely no background
in biology, chemistry or engineering,

00:00:28.067 --> 00:00:32.254
so bear with me, because I'll be talking
about biomedical engineering today.

00:00:32.278 --> 00:00:33.287
(Laughter)

00:00:33.311 --> 00:00:37.483
And please do stay here in the meantime.

00:00:37.507 --> 00:00:41.478
Industrial design is about
making lots of things identical.

00:00:41.502 --> 00:00:44.200
The downside about that is,
there's something impersonal

00:00:44.224 --> 00:00:45.764
about lots of identical things,

00:00:45.788 --> 00:00:48.741
because when you're trying
to design one thing for one person

00:00:48.765 --> 00:00:50.134
to solve one issue,

00:00:50.158 --> 00:00:51.439
you can't really do that

00:00:51.463 --> 00:00:54.525
when you're making things
aimed more to a demographic model

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:57.003
or to a marketing requirements document,

00:00:57.027 --> 00:00:58.431
which is what we live by.

00:00:58.455 --> 00:01:01.684
So I got disheartened
by the whole process in general,

00:01:01.708 --> 00:01:04.941
and went to rethink it
and redesign designing altogether,

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:07.823
went way back to my early, early
design inspirations,

00:01:07.847 --> 00:01:12.113
and back to about eight years old,
and that got me to this guy.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.205
Anyone here from MIT knows him

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.261
or has a tattoo or poster
of him somewhere.

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:18.298
(Laughter)

00:01:18.322 --> 00:01:20.547
Anyone else in the room, just for a hint,

00:01:20.571 --> 00:01:24.042
he is the engineer of engineers
or the designer of designers.

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:27.518
He is the guy who made bionics
a household word

00:01:27.542 --> 00:01:30.681
in the form of the polyester-clad
Six Million Dollar Man

00:01:30.705 --> 00:01:32.451
that I grew up with.

00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:35.716
The thing that came from
this pop culture show,

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.037
the real takeaway, was two main things:

00:01:38.061 --> 00:01:41.235
if you're designing for the person,
for a real person,

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.470
you don't settle for the minimum
functional requirements;

00:01:44.494 --> 00:01:46.390
you see how far beyond that you can go,

00:01:46.414 --> 00:01:48.853
where the rewards really are
way out in the fringe

00:01:48.877 --> 00:01:51.261
of how far past that document you can go.

00:01:51.285 --> 00:01:52.893
And if you can nail that,

00:01:52.917 --> 00:01:55.425
you stand to improve
the quality of life for somebody

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:57.646
for every moment
for the rest of their life.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.399
I kind of distilled that down
into a design philosophy,

00:02:01.423 --> 00:02:04.738
and infuse that
into the studio that I have now;

00:02:04.762 --> 00:02:07.766
I'm trying to get everyone
to think along these lines.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.871
It's not a profound philosophy,
but it works for us.

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.377
We work with prosthetic limbs,

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:18.141
and the first thing you see
about prosthetic limbs

00:02:18.165 --> 00:02:21.357
is that they are engineering brilliance.

00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:22.796
They can do amazing things;

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.601
they can return all kinds
of functionality and performance

00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:27.878
back to somebody's life.

00:02:27.902 --> 00:02:30.293
But from the vantage
of an industrial designer,

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:31.537
they're not quite there.

00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:35.869
What we don't see is the sculpture
or the beauty or the individual qualities

00:02:35.893 --> 00:02:38.453
or the uniqueness or the elegance to them.

00:02:38.477 --> 00:02:43.321
They are brilliant, mechanical,
utilitarian devices.

00:02:43.345 --> 00:02:46.727
And that's great, except
for a lot of people, that doesn't work.

00:02:46.751 --> 00:02:48.746
People come to our studio all the time,

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.702
and they have bubble wrap and duct tape,

00:02:51.726 --> 00:02:54.100
trying to approximate their original form.

00:02:54.124 --> 00:02:56.738
Or they'll have a gym sock
stuffed with other gym socks

00:02:56.762 --> 00:02:59.269
to try to recreate
the shape that once was;

00:02:59.293 --> 00:03:02.130
and that, to us, is not thriving.

00:03:02.154 --> 00:03:05.491
The body, to us,
is not a mechanical entity,

00:03:05.515 --> 00:03:08.059
where mechanical-only solutions
can address them.

00:03:08.083 --> 00:03:11.286
It's our personal sculpture,
our kinematic sculpture.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.476
It is our canvas;

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.456
it represents not just our physicality,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.590
but also a lot of our personality as well.

00:03:16.614 --> 00:03:18.545
So when you're designing for the body,

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.048
maybe the thing isn't to design
for mass production,

00:03:21.072 --> 00:03:23.522
but to design with the body in mind,

00:03:23.546 --> 00:03:26.125
to really think about curves
instead of hard geometry,

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:29.058
or uniqueness instead of identical.

00:03:29.082 --> 00:03:31.867
The problem is, we're constrained
by mass production,

00:03:31.891 --> 00:03:33.819
which makes a million identical things

00:03:33.843 --> 00:03:36.248
but can't make one unique,
individualized thing.

00:03:36.272 --> 00:03:38.901
So we scrapped that
in the new design process,

00:03:38.925 --> 00:03:40.619
and we start with the person.

00:03:40.643 --> 00:03:42.652
This is a three-dimensional scanner,

00:03:42.676 --> 00:03:44.896
and that's what happens
when you scan somebody:

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.435
you get three-dimensional data
into your computer.

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.041
You can take the sound-side limb there,
the surviving limb, mirror it over,

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.232
and from now on,

00:03:53.256 --> 00:03:55.638
anything in the process
will recreate symmetry --

00:03:55.662 --> 00:03:57.735
something as personal
and as hard to achieve

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:59.529
as symmetry in the body.

00:03:59.553 --> 00:04:02.036
And you create a product
that, no matter what,

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.355
it's going to be as unique
as their fingerprint.

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.901
In fact, our process is incapable
of creating two identical things.

00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:11.466
So we run it through
computer modeling, 3D CAD.

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.439
Here, we actually infuse a lot
of the individual's taste and personality

00:04:16.463 --> 00:04:18.091
into it, everywhere we can,

00:04:18.115 --> 00:04:20.420
and we three-dimensionally
print the results.

00:04:20.444 --> 00:04:22.348
We call the resulting parts "fairings,"

00:04:22.372 --> 00:04:25.359
because they're named
after the panels on a motorcycle

00:04:25.383 --> 00:04:28.693
that turn it from a mechanical thing
into a sculptural thing.

00:04:28.717 --> 00:04:32.207
We tried this on Chad.

00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:34.557
Chad is a competitive soccer player,

00:04:34.581 --> 00:04:36.485
lost his leg eight years ago to cancer.

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.961
You can imagine,
it's really tricky to play soccer

00:04:38.985 --> 00:04:41.931
when you have titanium pipe
where there used to be a leg.

00:04:41.955 --> 00:04:45.986
The resulting parts recreated his shape

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.081
and deliberately had an aesthetic
that look like sporting gear.

00:04:49.105 --> 00:04:52.517
We wanted it to make it look like
he just pulled it out of the gym bag,

00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:54.908
so it's fairly utilitarian in that regard.

00:04:54.932 --> 00:04:56.112
Two things happened.

00:04:56.136 --> 00:05:00.438
One, we expected: his sense
of his body came back to him.

00:05:00.462 --> 00:05:03.312
He was suddenly able to control
the ball, to feel the ball,

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:06.363
because his body remembered
that original shape that he had had

00:05:06.387 --> 00:05:07.613
up until eight years ago.

00:05:07.637 --> 00:05:10.725
The other thing, though,
is that the other members of the team

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:13.506
stopped thinking of him
as the amputee on the team.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.066
Not that they didn't know, but it stopped
becoming a focal point for him.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.295
And there is a certain
very quiet value in that,

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:21.809
we like to believe.

00:05:22.537 --> 00:05:25.155
James lost his leg in a motorcycle crash.

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:28.886
And the motorcycle is still a big part
of James's personality and style.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.747
Check out the tattoo on his forearm.

00:05:31.771 --> 00:05:35.641
We three-dimensionally printed that
into what would be his calf.

00:05:35.665 --> 00:05:38.280
He has his tattoo, he has his morphology

00:05:38.304 --> 00:05:40.618
and he has the materials
of his motorcycle.

00:05:40.642 --> 00:05:45.337
And the result is interesting in that
you can't really tell at first glance

00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:47.788
where the motorcycle stops
and where James starts.

00:05:47.812 --> 00:05:51.275
It's kind of a chimera hybrid
between the two,

00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:53.265
and James likes that.

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:54.683
(Laughter)

00:05:56.082 --> 00:06:00.560
So, we don't ever try to make something
look like it could be human.

00:06:00.584 --> 00:06:03.474
Our whole goal is to be
unapologetically man-made,

00:06:03.498 --> 00:06:06.191
to take what's already there, morphology,

00:06:06.215 --> 00:06:08.303
and just make it really
cool and beautiful,

00:06:08.327 --> 00:06:10.836
something that somebody
can't wait to show the world,

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.396
because that changes their look.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.685
You don't look at him and say,
"He's an amputee with a prosthetic."

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:18.464
You say, "He's a guy
with something really cool going on.

00:06:18.488 --> 00:06:20.184
Deborah wanted her curves back,

00:06:20.208 --> 00:06:24.254
but she also just wanted
what came out of it to be really sexy,

00:06:24.278 --> 00:06:26.648
which is great for us to hear.

00:06:26.672 --> 00:06:30.809
We created this lace pattern
that lends itself well to 3D printing.

00:06:30.833 --> 00:06:32.768
We created the first leg, I think,

00:06:32.792 --> 00:06:36.485
where the lace defines
the contour of the leg,

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:39.264
instead of the leg
giving form to the lace.

00:06:39.288 --> 00:06:41.053
We switched things over.

00:06:41.077 --> 00:06:44.108
What I like about this shot
is you can see daylight through it.

00:06:44.132 --> 00:06:45.943
So we're not trying to hide anything;

00:06:45.967 --> 00:06:48.486
the load-bearing carbon component
is totally visible.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.204
We're just giving it form
and shape and contours

00:06:52.228 --> 00:06:54.060
that were hers to begin with.

00:06:55.152 --> 00:06:57.909
We made her another leg
that matched her purse,

00:06:57.933 --> 00:06:59.209
just because we could.

00:06:59.233 --> 00:07:01.168
(Laughter)

00:07:03.108 --> 00:07:05.979
(Applause)

00:07:08.022 --> 00:07:11.360
We made another one
where we laser-tattooed the leather,

00:07:11.384 --> 00:07:12.781
because how cool would it be

00:07:12.805 --> 00:07:15.962
to be able to change your tattoos out
from one minute to the next?

00:07:15.986 --> 00:07:17.324
Love that.

00:07:17.348 --> 00:07:20.313
We try to capture as much
of somebody's personality as we can.

00:07:20.337 --> 00:07:23.653
This is George.
His will be finished next week.

00:07:24.137 --> 00:07:27.375
This is the raw computer data
that we deal with.

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:30.978
He's kind of a classic,
timeless-type personality,

00:07:31.002 --> 00:07:33.908
so we did herringbone tweed,
but in polished nickel.

00:07:33.932 --> 00:07:35.220
(Laughter)

00:07:35.244 --> 00:07:37.664
And Uve was all too proud
to show his tattoos,

00:07:37.688 --> 00:07:41.165
so we are laser-tattooing those
into the leather.

00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:44.178
Part of it is, yes, we're showing off,
because we can do this,

00:07:44.202 --> 00:07:47.623
but the other part is this connects him
to what will be a part of him.

00:07:47.647 --> 00:07:50.279
That is something really valuable;
we believe in that.

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:52.260
Tattoos are especially exciting for us.

00:07:52.284 --> 00:07:54.081
What happens if you take the tattoo,

00:07:54.105 --> 00:07:57.292
which is a combination
of somebody's personal taste and choice,

00:07:57.316 --> 00:07:58.902
and their morphology,

00:07:58.926 --> 00:08:01.329
but now, let's say, you remove the person.

00:08:01.353 --> 00:08:05.341
You get a free-floating tattoo
defining their body.

00:08:05.365 --> 00:08:09.708
So everything we do is about recreating
and expressing something

00:08:09.732 --> 00:08:11.469
that means something to that person,

00:08:11.493 --> 00:08:14.039
and expressing that through
what would be their body,

00:08:14.063 --> 00:08:17.944
whether it's speed or attitude or bling,

00:08:17.968 --> 00:08:21.859
whatever it is that captures
and suggests them in the best way we can.

00:08:23.251 --> 00:08:25.771
Back to the 3D-printing thing
and this whole process:

00:08:25.795 --> 00:08:29.122
we have a process that lends itself
to making one thing per person;

00:08:29.146 --> 00:08:32.958
it's very individual, and it actually
really lends itself well to complexity.

00:08:32.982 --> 00:08:34.931
So why not just print the entire leg?

00:08:34.955 --> 00:08:38.847
That's the concept that preceded
the work we're doing now.

00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:43.047
This is a three-dimensionally printed leg.
It's symmetric to the other leg.

00:08:43.071 --> 00:08:45.436
It is made in America,

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:51.111
it is a trivially low-carbon footprint
to create, curbside recyclable,

00:08:51.135 --> 00:08:53.896
costs about 4,000 dollars to create,

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.177
and it is dishwasher-safe.

00:08:56.201 --> 00:08:58.085
(Laughter)

00:08:58.109 --> 00:08:59.591
There's a value to that, too.

00:08:59.615 --> 00:09:01.670
People don't think
about that all the time,

00:09:01.694 --> 00:09:04.504
but yes, throw it in the dishwasher,
it works just great.

00:09:04.528 --> 00:09:08.040
This was based on the original idea
that I could go anywhere in the world

00:09:08.064 --> 00:09:10.677
with nothing more than a camera
and a laptop computer,

00:09:10.701 --> 00:09:14.480
use the camera as a 3D scanner and create
for somebody, in a matter of hours,

00:09:14.504 --> 00:09:18.162
a very high-quality, three-dimensionally
printed leg for a very low cost.

00:09:18.186 --> 00:09:21.864
The proof of concept works great,
we're finding it; we'll get there.

00:09:22.699 --> 00:09:26.532
Or, we upped the quality of the materials
and created this for John.

00:09:26.556 --> 00:09:31.050
The fun thing with John's leg
is that when his fiancee looked at this,

00:09:31.074 --> 00:09:34.973
she joked and said, "I like that leg
better than that leg."

00:09:34.997 --> 00:09:36.670
(Laughter)

00:09:36.694 --> 00:09:40.015
And it's a joke -- she knows full well
what he goes through --

00:09:40.039 --> 00:09:42.647
but at the same time,
there's something very valuable.

00:09:42.671 --> 00:09:44.878
He turned to us and said,
"Nobody says that."

00:09:44.902 --> 00:09:46.570
He's never heard that in his life.

00:09:46.594 --> 00:09:49.277
That connected with him very deeply.

00:09:49.301 --> 00:09:52.595
So we like to think
that this is a new type of design,

00:09:52.619 --> 00:09:56.805
where you're turning
the original process on its head,

00:09:56.829 --> 00:10:00.373
where there is a dialogue that forms
between the designer and the end user,

00:10:00.397 --> 00:10:02.988
where the designer relinquishes
some of the control --

00:10:03.012 --> 00:10:04.352
designers hate doing that --

00:10:04.376 --> 00:10:07.749
and instead, is the curator of a process.

00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:12.046
And the end user relinquishes their body
into the process, and their taste.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.354
I'd like to think that speaks
to a greater change that's happening

00:10:15.378 --> 00:10:16.938
in the design world altogether;

00:10:16.962 --> 00:10:20.589
in this case, it's one where
products will be evaluated

00:10:20.613 --> 00:10:23.373
on how well they address the individual.

00:10:24.264 --> 00:10:29.286
The individual will actually be
part of the DNA of the end product itself.

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:33.682
We will be evaluating products
on how well they address a unique person,

00:10:33.706 --> 00:10:35.579
instead of a demographic model.

00:10:36.316 --> 00:10:40.117
This all really hit home for us
in one of the first legs we did;

00:10:40.141 --> 00:10:42.858
when Chad here put on the leg,

00:10:42.882 --> 00:10:44.542
reached down and felt it

00:10:44.566 --> 00:10:46.157
and thought about it for a while.

00:10:46.181 --> 00:10:47.762
Then he turned to us and said,

00:10:47.786 --> 00:10:51.239
"That's the first time I've felt
that shape in eight years."

00:10:51.783 --> 00:10:53.199
We thought about that.

00:10:53.223 --> 00:10:54.485
And for all the technology

00:10:54.509 --> 00:10:57.179
and all the nights
and energy we put into it,

00:10:57.203 --> 00:10:59.165
that's all we really wanted to hear.

00:10:59.769 --> 00:11:00.961
Thanks.

00:11:00.985 --> 00:11:02.468
(Applause)
