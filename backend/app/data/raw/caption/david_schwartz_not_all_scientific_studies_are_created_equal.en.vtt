00:00:06.659 --> 00:00:07.995
Studies have shown that

00:00:07.995 --> 00:00:10.198
taking vitamins is good for your health

00:00:10.198 --> 00:00:11.916
and bad for your health.

00:00:11.916 --> 00:00:14.417
That newly discovered herb can improve your memory

00:00:14.417 --> 00:00:16.086
or destroy your liver.

00:00:16.086 --> 00:00:18.453
Headlines proclaim a promising new cancer treatment

00:00:18.453 --> 00:00:20.450
and never mention it again.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.866
On a daily basis,

00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.802
we are bombarded with attention-grabbing news,

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:25.722
backed up by scientific studies,

00:00:25.722 --> 00:00:27.306
but what are these studies?

00:00:27.306 --> 00:00:28.654
How are they performed?

00:00:28.654 --> 00:00:30.392
And how do we know whether they're reliable?

00:00:30.392 --> 00:00:32.949
When it comes to dietary or medical information,

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.447
the first thing to remember

00:00:34.447 --> 00:00:37.151
is that while studies on animals or individual cells

00:00:37.151 --> 00:00:39.526
can point the way towards further research,

00:00:39.526 --> 00:00:41.737
the only way to know how something will affect humans

00:00:41.737 --> 00:00:44.782
is through a study involving human subjects.

00:00:44.782 --> 00:00:46.282
And when it comes to human studies,

00:00:46.282 --> 00:00:48.245
the scientific gold standard is

00:00:48.245 --> 00:00:51.454
the randomized clinical trial, or RCT.

00:00:51.454 --> 00:00:54.366
The key to RCTs is that the subjects are randomly assigned

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.836
to their study groups.

00:00:55.836 --> 00:00:57.698
They are often blinded to make them more rigorous.

00:00:57.698 --> 00:00:59.365
This process attempts to ensure

00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:01.048
that the only difference between the groups

00:01:01.048 --> 00:01:03.760
is the one the researchers are attempting to study.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.968
For example,

00:01:04.968 --> 00:01:06.304
when testing a new headache medication,

00:01:06.304 --> 00:01:08.061
a large pool of people with headaches

00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:10.224
would be randomly divided into two groups,

00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:12.227
one receiving the medication

00:01:12.227 --> 00:01:14.145
and another receiving a placebo.

00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:15.647
With proper randomization,

00:01:15.647 --> 00:01:17.357
the only significant overall difference

00:01:17.357 --> 00:01:19.023
between the two groups

00:01:19.023 --> 00:01:21.360
will be whether or not they received the medication,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.280
rather than other differences that could affect results.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.783
Randomized clinical trials are incredible tools,

00:01:26.783 --> 00:01:29.365
and, in fact, the US Food and Drug Administration

00:01:29.365 --> 00:01:32.197
often requires at least two to be conducted

00:01:32.197 --> 00:01:34.866
before a new drug can be marketed.

00:01:34.866 --> 00:01:37.532
But the problem is that an RCT is not possible

00:01:37.532 --> 00:01:38.783
in many cases,

00:01:38.783 --> 00:01:40.366
either because it's not practical

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.339
or would require too many volunteers.

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:43.699
In such cases,

00:01:43.699 --> 00:01:46.010
scientists use an epidemiological study,

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.054
which simply observes people going about their usual behavior,

00:01:49.054 --> 00:01:52.141
rather than randomly assigning active participants

00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:54.436
to control invariable groups.

00:01:54.436 --> 00:01:55.728
Let's say we wanted to study

00:01:55.728 --> 00:01:57.283
whether an herbal ingredient on the market

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.698
causes nausea.

00:01:58.698 --> 00:02:00.317
Rather than deliberately giving people something

00:02:00.317 --> 00:02:01.817
that might make them nauseated,

00:02:01.817 --> 00:02:03.820
we would find those who already take the ingredient

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.446
in their everyday lives.

00:02:05.446 --> 00:02:07.447
This group is called the cohort.

00:02:07.447 --> 00:02:09.155
We would also need a comparison group

00:02:09.155 --> 00:02:11.616
of people who do not have exposure to the ingredient.

00:02:11.616 --> 00:02:13.664
And we would then compare statistics.

00:02:13.664 --> 00:02:16.283
If the rate of nausea is higher in the herbal cohort,

00:02:16.283 --> 00:02:18.199
it suggests an association

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:20.448
between the herbal supplement and nausea.

00:02:20.448 --> 00:02:22.365
Epidemiological studies are great tools

00:02:22.365 --> 00:02:24.867
to study the health effects of almost anything,

00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:27.051
without directly interfering in people's lives

00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:29.804
or assigning them to potentially dangerous exposures.

00:02:29.804 --> 00:02:31.556
So, why can't we rely on these studies

00:02:31.556 --> 00:02:33.055
to establish causal relationships

00:02:33.055 --> 00:02:35.725
between substances and their effects on health?

00:02:35.725 --> 00:02:36.981
The problem is

00:02:36.981 --> 00:02:38.731
that even the best conducted epidemiological studies

00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:40.315
have inherent flaws.

00:02:40.315 --> 00:02:42.149
Precisely because the test subjects

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:44.476
are not randomly assigned to their groups.

00:02:44.476 --> 00:02:47.365
For example, if the cohort in our herbal study

00:02:47.365 --> 00:02:49.239
consisted of people who took the supplement

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.699
for health reasons,

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:52.615
they may have already had higher rates of nausea

00:02:52.615 --> 00:02:54.532
than the other people in the sample.

00:02:54.532 --> 00:02:56.616
Or the cohort group could've been composed of

00:02:56.616 --> 00:02:58.783
people who shop at health food stores

00:02:58.783 --> 00:03:00.364
and have different diets

00:03:00.364 --> 00:03:02.128
or better access to healthcare.

00:03:02.128 --> 00:03:03.755
These factors that can affect results,

00:03:03.755 --> 00:03:05.449
in addition to the factor being studied,

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:07.757
are known as confounding variables.

00:03:07.757 --> 00:03:09.469
These two major pitfalls,

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:10.949
combined with more general dangers,

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:13.806
such as conflicts of interest or selective use of data,

00:03:13.806 --> 00:03:17.533
can make the findings of any particular epidemiological study suspect,

00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:19.312
and a good study must go out of its way

00:03:19.312 --> 00:03:21.033
to prove that its authors have taken steps

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:23.364
to eliminate these types of errors.

00:03:23.364 --> 00:03:25.076
But even when this has been done,

00:03:25.076 --> 00:03:27.068
the very nature of epidemiological studies,

00:03:27.068 --> 00:03:29.572
which examine differences between preexisting groups,

00:03:29.572 --> 00:03:33.033
rather than deliberately inducing changes within the same individuals,

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:34.577
means that a single study

00:03:34.577 --> 00:03:36.365
can only demonstrate a correlation

00:03:36.365 --> 00:03:38.459
between a substance and a health outcome,

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.531
rather than a true cause and effect relationship.

00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:42.918
At the end of the day,

00:03:42.918 --> 00:03:46.116
epidemiological studies have served as excellent guides to public health,

00:03:46.116 --> 00:03:47.616
alerting us to critical health hazards,

00:03:47.616 --> 00:03:51.386
such as smoking, asbestos, lead, and many more.

00:03:51.386 --> 00:03:53.036
But these were demonstrated through

00:03:53.036 --> 00:03:55.876
multiple, well-conducted epidemiological studies,

00:03:55.876 --> 00:03:57.850
all pointing in the same direction.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.558
So, the next time you see a headline

00:03:59.558 --> 00:04:00.852
about a new miracle cure

00:04:00.852 --> 00:04:03.534
or the terrible danger posed by an everyday substance,

00:04:03.534 --> 00:04:05.482
try to learn more about the original study

00:04:05.482 --> 00:04:09.283
and the limitations inherent in any epidemiological study or clinical trial

00:04:09.283 --> 00:04:11.279
before jumping to conclusions.
