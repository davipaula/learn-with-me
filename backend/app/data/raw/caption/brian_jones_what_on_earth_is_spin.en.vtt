00:00:15.173 --> 00:00:17.464
The next time you see a news report of a hurricane

00:00:17.464 --> 00:00:18.674
or a tropical storm

00:00:18.674 --> 00:00:21.281
showing high winds battering trees and houses,

00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:24.555
ask yourself, "How did the wind get going so fast?"

00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:26.849
Amazingly enough, this is a motion that started

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.934
more than five billion years ago.

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:32.331
But, to understand why, we need to understand spin.

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:34.665
In physics, we talk about two types of motion.

00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:36.441
The first is straight-line motion.

00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:38.735
You push on something, and it moves forward.

00:00:38.735 --> 00:00:42.072
The second type, spin, involves an object rotating,

00:00:42.072 --> 00:00:44.534
or turning on its axis in place.

00:00:44.534 --> 00:00:46.918
An object in straight-line motion will move forever

00:00:46.918 --> 00:00:47.869
unless something,

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:49.755
like the friction of the ground beneath it,

00:00:49.755 --> 00:00:52.040
causes it to slow down and stop.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.576
The same thing happens when you get something spinning.

00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:57.587
It will keep on spinning until something stops it.

00:00:57.587 --> 00:00:59.673
But the spin can speed up.

00:00:59.673 --> 00:01:01.954
If an ice skater is gliding across the ice

00:01:01.954 --> 00:01:04.552
in straight-line motion and she pulls her arms in,

00:01:04.552 --> 00:01:06.930
she keeps on gliding at the same speed.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.559
But if she is spinning on the ice

00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:09.849
and she pulls her arms in,

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:11.679
you know what happens next.

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:13.420
She spins faster.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.024
This is called the conservation of angular momentum.

00:01:17.024 --> 00:01:20.614
Mathematically, angular momentum is a product of two numbers,

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:21.949
one that gives the spin rate

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:24.911
and one that gives the distance of the mass from the axis.

00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:26.665
If something is freely spinning,

00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:28.095
as one number gets bigger,

00:01:28.095 --> 00:01:29.618
the other gets smaller.

00:01:29.618 --> 00:01:31.978
Arms closer, spin faster.

00:01:31.978 --> 00:01:34.710
Arms farther, spin slower.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.784
Spin causes other effects, too.

00:01:36.784 --> 00:01:38.451
If you are riding on a spinning merry-go-round

00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:40.176
and you toss a ball to a friend,

00:01:40.176 --> 00:01:42.514
it will appear to follow a curving path.

00:01:42.514 --> 00:01:44.628
It doesn't actually curve, though.

00:01:44.628 --> 00:01:46.601
It really goes in a straight line.

00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:49.049
You were the one who was following a curving path,

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.582
but, from your point of view,

00:01:50.582 --> 00:01:52.477
the ball appears to curve.

00:01:52.477 --> 00:01:54.934
We call this the coriolis effect.

00:01:54.934 --> 00:01:57.156
Oh, and you are riding on a speeding merry-go-round

00:01:57.156 --> 00:01:59.175
right now at this very moment.

00:01:59.175 --> 00:02:00.676
We call it the Earth.

00:02:00.676 --> 00:02:03.578
The Earth spins on its axis once each day.

00:02:03.578 --> 00:02:05.024
But why does the Earth spin?

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:08.118
Now, that's a story that starts billions of years ago.

00:02:08.118 --> 00:02:09.856
A cloud of dust and gas that form

00:02:09.856 --> 00:02:11.070
the Sun and the Earth and the planets

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.113
and you and me

00:02:12.113 --> 00:02:15.032
started to collapse as gravity pulled it all together.

00:02:15.032 --> 00:02:16.678
Before it started to collapse,

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:19.175
this cloud had a very gentle spin.

00:02:19.175 --> 00:02:20.490
And, as it collapsed,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.619
like that ice skater pulling her arms in,

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:24.631
the spin got faster and faster.

00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:26.680
And everything that formed out of the cloud,

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.308
the Sun

00:02:27.308 --> 00:02:28.820
and the planets around the Sun

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.503
and the moons around the planets,

00:02:30.503 --> 00:02:32.592
all inherited this spin.

00:02:32.592 --> 00:02:35.635
And this inherited spin is what gives us night and day.

00:02:35.635 --> 00:02:38.638
And this day-night cycle is what drives our weather.

00:02:38.638 --> 00:02:40.442
The Earth is warm on the daytime side,

00:02:40.442 --> 00:02:42.108
cool on the nighttime side,

00:02:42.108 --> 00:02:44.563
and it's warmer at the equator than at the poles.

00:02:44.563 --> 00:02:46.022
The differences in temperature

00:02:46.022 --> 00:02:47.778
make differences in air pressure,

00:02:47.778 --> 00:02:49.003
and the differences in air pressure

00:02:49.003 --> 00:02:50.313
make air move.

00:02:50.313 --> 00:02:51.652
They make the wind blow.

00:02:51.652 --> 00:02:53.027
But, because the Earth spins,

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:54.571
the moving air curves to the right

00:02:54.571 --> 00:02:55.908
in the Northern Hemisphere

00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:58.840
because of the coriolis effect.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.213
If there's a region of low pressure in the atmosphere,

00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:02.243
air is pushed toward it,

00:03:02.243 --> 00:03:04.106
like water going down a drain.

00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:06.227
But the air curves to the right as it goes,

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:08.496
and this gives it a spin.

00:03:08.496 --> 00:03:10.594
With the dramatic low pressure in a storm,

00:03:10.594 --> 00:03:12.517
the air gets pulled in tighter and tighter,

00:03:12.517 --> 00:03:14.433
so it gets going faster and faster,

00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:18.325
and this is how we get the high winds of a hurricane.

00:03:18.325 --> 00:03:20.466
So, when you see a spinning storm on a weather report,

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:21.816
think about this:

00:03:21.816 --> 00:03:24.856
The spin ultimately came from the spin of the Earth,

00:03:24.856 --> 00:03:26.350
and the Earth's spin is a remnant,

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.529
a fossil relic,

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:30.283
of the gentle spin of the cloud of dust and gas

00:03:30.283 --> 00:03:31.703
that collapsed to make the Earth

00:03:31.703 --> 00:03:33.618
some five billion years ago.

00:03:33.618 --> 00:03:35.952
You are watching something, the spin,

00:03:35.952 --> 00:03:37.414
that is older than dirt,

00:03:37.414 --> 00:03:38.533
that's older than rocks,

00:03:38.533 --> 00:03:41.324
that's older than the Earth itself.
