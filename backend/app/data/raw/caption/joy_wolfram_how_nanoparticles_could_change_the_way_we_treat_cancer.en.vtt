00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:17.627
It was a Sunday afternoon
back in April of this year.

00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:19.500
My phone was ringing,

00:00:19.524 --> 00:00:20.868
I picked it up.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.394
The voice said, "It's Rebecca.

00:00:24.847 --> 00:00:27.395
I'm just calling to invite you

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:28.722
to my funeral."

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.569
I said, "Rebecca,
what are you talking about?"

00:00:33.593 --> 00:00:38.721
She said, "Joy, as my friend,
you have to let me go.

00:00:39.235 --> 00:00:40.385
It's my time."

00:00:41.854 --> 00:00:44.179
The next day, she was dead.

00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:49.179
Rebecca was 31 years old when she died.

00:00:49.657 --> 00:00:53.506
She had an eight-year struggle
with breast cancer.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.413
It came back three times.

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.536
I failed her.

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:01.042
The scientific community failed her.

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.046
And the medical community failed her.

00:01:05.254 --> 00:01:07.054
And she's not the only one.

00:01:07.674 --> 00:01:09.569
Every five seconds,

00:01:09.593 --> 00:01:12.029
someone dies of cancer.

00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:17.659
Today, we medical
researchers are committed

00:01:17.683 --> 00:01:20.945
to having Rebecca and people like her

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:23.769
be one of the last patients that we fail.

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:30.613
The US government alone has spent
over 100 billion on cancer research

00:01:30.637 --> 00:01:32.257
since the 1970s,

00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:36.212
with limited progress
in regards to patient survival,

00:01:36.236 --> 00:01:40.036
especially for certain types
of very aggressive cancers.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.155
So we need a change because, clearly,

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.193
what we've been doing so far
has not been working.

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.966
And what we do in medicine
is to send out firefighters,

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.257
because cancer is like a big fire.

00:01:54.784 --> 00:01:57.577
And these firefighters
are the cancer drugs.

00:01:58.228 --> 00:02:02.291
But we're sending them out
without a fire truck --

00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:05.482
so without transportation, without ladders

00:02:05.506 --> 00:02:07.639
and without emergency equipment.

00:02:08.657 --> 00:02:14.628
And over 99 percent of these firefighters
never make it to the fire.

00:02:15.553 --> 00:02:20.582
Over 99 percent of cancer drugs
never make it to the tumor

00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:24.836
because they lack transportation and tools

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.463
to take them to the location
they're aiming for.

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:33.939
Turns out, it really is all about
location, location, location.

00:02:33.963 --> 00:02:35.086
(Laughter)

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.301
So we need a fire truck
to get to the right location.

00:02:40.403 --> 00:02:44.977
And I'm here to tell you
that nanoparticles are the fire trucks.

00:02:45.323 --> 00:02:49.405
We can load cancer drugs
inside nanoparticles,

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:53.079
and nanoparticles
can function as the carrier

00:02:53.103 --> 00:02:54.984
and necessary equipment

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:58.761
to bring the cancer drugs
to the heart of the tumor.

00:03:00.315 --> 00:03:01.817
So what are nanoparticles,

00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:04.608
and what does it really mean
to be nano-sized?

00:03:05.664 --> 00:03:09.037
Well, there are many different
types of nanoparticles

00:03:09.061 --> 00:03:10.736
made out of various materials,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.133
such as metal-based nanoparticles

00:03:14.157 --> 00:03:16.529
or fat-based nanoparticles.

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:20.880
But to really illustrate
what it means to be nano-sized,

00:03:20.904 --> 00:03:23.658
I took one of my hair strands

00:03:23.682 --> 00:03:25.649
and placed it under the microscope.

00:03:26.094 --> 00:03:27.562
Now, I have very thin hair,

00:03:27.586 --> 00:03:32.772
so my hair is approximately
40,000 nanometers in diameter.

00:03:33.283 --> 00:03:36.268
So this means, if we take
400 of our nanoparticles

00:03:36.292 --> 00:03:39.260
and we stack them on top of each other,

00:03:39.284 --> 00:03:42.855
we get the thickness
of a single hair strand.

00:03:43.577 --> 00:03:49.172
I lead a nanoparticle laboratory
to fight cancer and other diseases

00:03:49.196 --> 00:03:51.596
at Mayo Clinic here in Jacksonville.

00:03:52.228 --> 00:03:53.394
And at Mayo Clinic,

00:03:53.418 --> 00:03:57.121
we really have the tools
to make a difference for patients,

00:03:57.145 --> 00:04:01.978
thanks to the generous donations
and grants to fund our research.

00:04:03.574 --> 00:04:07.981
And so, how do these nanoparticles
manage to transport cancer drugs

00:04:08.005 --> 00:04:09.155
to the tumor?

00:04:09.807 --> 00:04:12.751
Well, they have an extensive toolbox.

00:04:13.982 --> 00:04:18.668
Cancer drugs without nanoparticles
are quickly washed out of the body

00:04:18.692 --> 00:04:19.857
through the kidneys

00:04:19.881 --> 00:04:21.826
because they're so small.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.002
So it's like water going through a sieve.

00:04:24.628 --> 00:04:27.770
And so they don't really have time
to reach the tumor.

00:04:27.794 --> 00:04:30.022
Here we see an illustration of this.

00:04:30.046 --> 00:04:32.252
We have the firefighters,
the cancer drugs.

00:04:32.276 --> 00:04:34.387
They're circulating in the blood,

00:04:34.411 --> 00:04:36.434
but they're quickly
washed out of the body

00:04:36.458 --> 00:04:39.592
and they don't really end up
inside the tumor.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.077
But if we put these cancer drugs
inside nanoparticles,

00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:47.188
they will not get washed out by the body

00:04:47.212 --> 00:04:49.529
because the nanoparticles are too big.

00:04:49.553 --> 00:04:52.731
And they will continue
to circulate in the blood,

00:04:52.755 --> 00:04:55.685
giving them more time to find the tumor.

00:04:56.252 --> 00:04:58.823
And here we see the cancer drug,
the firefighters,

00:04:58.847 --> 00:05:02.289
inside the fire truck, the nanoparticles.

00:05:02.313 --> 00:05:03.988
They're circulating in the blood,

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.948
they don't get washed out

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:09.138
and they actually end up
reaching the tumor.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.099
And so what other tools
do nanoparticles have?

00:05:14.785 --> 00:05:19.734
Well, they can protect cancer drugs
from getting destroyed inside the body.

00:05:20.293 --> 00:05:24.053
There are certain very important
but sensitive drugs

00:05:24.077 --> 00:05:27.315
that are easily degraded
by enzymes in the blood.

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:30.625
So unless they have
this nanoparticle protection,

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:32.934
they will not be able to function.

00:05:34.362 --> 00:05:37.363
Another nanoparticle tool
are these surface extensions

00:05:37.387 --> 00:05:42.506
that are like tiny hands with fingers
that grab on to the tumor

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.117
and fit exactly onto it,

00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:46.426
so that when the nanoparticles
are circulating,

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.006
they can attach onto the cancer cells,

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.591
buying the cancer drugs
more time to do their job.

00:05:53.887 --> 00:05:58.023
And these are just some of the many tools
that nanoparticles can have.

00:05:58.585 --> 00:05:59.760
And today,

00:05:59.784 --> 00:06:03.974
we have more than 10 clinically approved
nanoparticles for cancer

00:06:03.998 --> 00:06:07.164
that are given to patients
all over the world.

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:12.362
Yet, we have patients,
like Rebecca, who die.

00:06:13.362 --> 00:06:17.275
So what are the major
challenges and limitations

00:06:17.299 --> 00:06:20.088
with currently approved nanoparticles?

00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:24.938
Well, a major challenge is the liver,

00:06:24.962 --> 00:06:28.033
because the liver is the body's
filtration system,

00:06:28.057 --> 00:06:31.655
and the liver recognizes
and destroys foreign objects,

00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:35.731
such as viruses, bacteria
and also nanoparticles.

00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:39.580
And the immune cells in the liver
eat the nanoparticles,

00:06:39.604 --> 00:06:43.069
preventing them from reaching the tumor.

00:06:45.367 --> 00:06:49.136
And here we see an illustration
where the kidney is no longer a problem,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.580
but these fire trucks, the nanoparticles,

00:06:51.604 --> 00:06:53.267
get stuck in the liver

00:06:53.291 --> 00:06:57.701
and, actually, less of them
end up reaching the tumor.

00:06:59.164 --> 00:07:02.462
So a future strategy
to improve nanoparticles

00:07:02.486 --> 00:07:06.708
is to temporarily disarm
the immune cells in the liver.

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:09.532
So how do we disarm these cells?

00:07:09.883 --> 00:07:13.515
Well, we looked at drugs
that were already clinically approved

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:15.395
for other indications

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:18.196
to see if any of them
could stop the immune cells

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.815
from eating the nanoparticles.

00:07:21.776 --> 00:07:25.942
And unexpectedly,
in one of our preclinical studies,

00:07:25.966 --> 00:07:30.104
we found that a 70-year-old malaria drug

00:07:30.128 --> 00:07:34.958
was able to stop the immune cells
from internalizing the nanoparticles

00:07:34.982 --> 00:07:37.212
so that they could escape the liver

00:07:37.236 --> 00:07:41.196
and continue their journey
to their goal, the tumor.

00:07:42.538 --> 00:07:45.689
And here we see the illustration
of blocking the liver.

00:07:45.713 --> 00:07:47.546
The nanoparticles don't go there,

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.197
and they instead end up in the tumor.

00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:55.831
So, sometimes, unexpected connections
are made in science

00:07:55.855 --> 00:07:58.132
that lead to new solutions.

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:03.630
Another strategy
for preventing nanoparticles

00:08:03.654 --> 00:08:06.196
from getting stuck in the liver

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.450
is to use the body's own nanoparticles.

00:08:09.474 --> 00:08:10.942
Yes -- surprise, surprise.

00:08:10.966 --> 00:08:16.073
You, and you and you, and all of us
have a lot of nanoparticles

00:08:16.097 --> 00:08:17.964
circulating in our bodies.

00:08:18.434 --> 00:08:21.069
And because they're part of our bodies,

00:08:21.093 --> 00:08:25.270
the liver is less likely
to label them as foreign.

00:08:26.998 --> 00:08:30.712
And these biological nanoparticles
can be found in the saliva,

00:08:30.736 --> 00:08:33.958
in the blood, in the urine,
in pancreatic juice.

00:08:33.982 --> 00:08:35.975
And we can collect them from the body

00:08:35.999 --> 00:08:40.091
and use them as fire trucks
for cancer drugs.

00:08:40.855 --> 00:08:42.093
And in this case,

00:08:42.117 --> 00:08:45.316
the immune cells in the liver
are less likely to eat

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.289
the biological nanoparticles.

00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:50.619
So we're using
a Trojan-horse-based concept

00:08:50.643 --> 00:08:52.230
to fool the liver.

00:08:52.921 --> 00:08:55.278
And here we see
the biological nanoparticles

00:08:55.302 --> 00:08:56.881
circulating in the blood.

00:08:56.905 --> 00:08:59.301
They don't get recognized by the liver,

00:08:59.325 --> 00:09:01.489
and they end up in the tumor.

00:09:02.413 --> 00:09:03.849
And in the future,

00:09:03.873 --> 00:09:07.396
we want to exploit
nature's own nanoparticles

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.493
for cancer drug delivery,

00:09:10.387 --> 00:09:13.323
to reduce side effects and save lives

00:09:13.347 --> 00:09:18.267
by preventing the cancer drugs
from being in the wrong location.

00:09:19.761 --> 00:09:21.952
However, a major problem has been:

00:09:21.976 --> 00:09:27.913
How do we isolate these biological
nanoparticles in large quantities

00:09:27.937 --> 00:09:29.524
without damaging them?

00:09:30.915 --> 00:09:33.787
My lab has developed
an efficient method for doing this.

00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:38.248
We can process large quantities
of liquids from the body

00:09:38.272 --> 00:09:43.057
to produce a highly concentrated,
high-quality formulation

00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:45.037
of biological nanoparticles.

00:09:46.136 --> 00:09:50.279
And these nanoparticles
are not yet in clinical use,

00:09:50.303 --> 00:09:53.315
because it takes an average of 12 years

00:09:53.339 --> 00:09:55.775
to get something from the lab

00:09:55.799 --> 00:09:57.893
to your medicine cabinet.

00:10:00.093 --> 00:10:04.694
And this is the type of challenge
that requires teamwork

00:10:04.718 --> 00:10:07.958
from scientists and physicians,

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:10.910
who dedicate their lives to this battle.

00:10:12.149 --> 00:10:16.881
And we keep going,
thanks to inspiration from patients.

00:10:17.532 --> 00:10:21.691
And I believe that if we keep working
on these nanomedicines,

00:10:21.715 --> 00:10:25.537
we will be able to reduce harm
to healthy organs,

00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:27.307
improve quality of life

00:10:27.331 --> 00:10:29.783
and save future patients.

00:10:32.363 --> 00:10:34.593
I like to imagine

00:10:34.617 --> 00:10:39.745
that if these treatments
had been available for Rebecca,

00:10:39.769 --> 00:10:41.761
that call from her

00:10:41.785 --> 00:10:43.423
could have been an invitation

00:10:44.516 --> 00:10:46.182
not to her funeral,

00:10:46.206 --> 00:10:47.372
but her wedding.

00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:48.761
Thank you.

00:10:48.785 --> 00:10:52.020
(Applause)
