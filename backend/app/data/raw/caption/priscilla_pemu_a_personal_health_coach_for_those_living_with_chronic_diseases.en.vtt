00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:16.119
When I first became a doctor

00:00:16.143 --> 00:00:18.148
in Benin City, Nigeria,

00:00:18.172 --> 00:00:21.113
some 30-odd years ago,

00:00:21.137 --> 00:00:25.151
I was drawn to help
people live full lives.

00:00:26.068 --> 00:00:28.967
But often, I found myself
feeling impotent.

00:00:29.524 --> 00:00:33.390
Here I was, a brand-new doctor
with all these skills,

00:00:33.414 --> 00:00:37.645
but I couldn't cure my patients
who had chronic diseases --

00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:42.908
illnesses like heart disease,
asthma, diabetes --

00:00:42.932 --> 00:00:46.171
and needed more than just
handing them a prescription

00:00:46.195 --> 00:00:50.122
or providing grief counseling
in the office to get the job done.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.174
Fast-forward 15 years later:

00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:55.065
I'm in Atlanta, Georgia;

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.186
it's a different world,

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.038
but it was déjà vu all over again.

00:01:00.062 --> 00:01:04.228
As doctors, we see our patients
who have chronic illnesses

00:01:04.252 --> 00:01:06.537
in an episodic way.

00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:07.842
In between,

00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:12.413
the patients have to learn how to make
a lot of decisions for themselves.

00:01:12.437 --> 00:01:14.364
I'll give you examples.

00:01:14.388 --> 00:01:17.269
If you have medications
you're supposed to take every day,

00:01:17.293 --> 00:01:19.279
what do you do when you're sick?

00:01:19.303 --> 00:01:21.089
Are you still supposed to take it?

00:01:21.113 --> 00:01:23.993
How do you recognize
a complication when it happens?

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:26.432
How do you recognize
a side effect when it happens?

00:01:26.456 --> 00:01:27.622
What do you do with it?

00:01:27.646 --> 00:01:29.569
In addition to all of this,

00:01:29.593 --> 00:01:34.655
they're dealing with the inevitable
loneliness, isolation and anxiety

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:37.837
that people who have
chronic illnesses deal with.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:43.900
In the US alone, six in 10 adults
have a chronic illness.

00:01:43.924 --> 00:01:46.926
That's 125 million people.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.520
A recent report from
the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:56.607
showed that health habits
account for 50 percent

00:01:56.631 --> 00:01:58.924
of the health outcomes
that people experience,

00:01:58.948 --> 00:02:02.489
while medical care
only accounts for 20 percent.

00:02:02.953 --> 00:02:06.488
In fact, the Centers for Disease Control

00:02:06.512 --> 00:02:10.175
says that if we could eliminate smoking,

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.553
physical inactivity and poor nutrition,

00:02:13.577 --> 00:02:16.934
that we can prevent
80 percent of heart disease,

00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.264
80 percent of type 2 diabetes

00:02:19.288 --> 00:02:21.419
and 40 percent of cancer.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.322
But we also know

00:02:24.346 --> 00:02:28.339
that changing health behaviors
is very difficult.

00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:30.187
So we asked the question:

00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:34.538
What if we could create a resource

00:02:34.562 --> 00:02:38.752
that could motivate people
to change health behavior?

00:02:39.745 --> 00:02:43.746
The truth is, there are a lot
of these resources out there

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.225
that help people acquire
these so-called self-management skills.

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:52.775
But many a time, they're not
easily accessible or relatable,

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.726
particularly to individuals within
minority and underserved communities,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.801
who face bias in addition to barriers
like language and culture

00:03:02.825 --> 00:03:05.597
and inadequate health insurance coverage.

00:03:06.428 --> 00:03:07.989
And so in the last 12 years,

00:03:08.013 --> 00:03:10.441
my colleagues and I
at Morehouse School of Medicine

00:03:10.465 --> 00:03:13.459
have created a
technology-based application

00:03:13.483 --> 00:03:16.147
to assist with chronic illness care.

00:03:16.171 --> 00:03:18.530
It's freely available on the web

00:03:18.554 --> 00:03:19.815
and as an app.

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:23.132
And what we do is get people
to track variables --

00:03:23.156 --> 00:03:24.921
blood pressure, blood sugar --

00:03:24.945 --> 00:03:29.276
and then report it back to them
in a color-coded format.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.899
So green would indicate a healthy range,

00:03:31.923 --> 00:03:36.086
and red would indicate a problem
that needs something done about it.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.812
We link these stats to a curriculum.

00:03:39.836 --> 00:03:44.071
The curriculum helps the individual
learn about their health condition,

00:03:44.095 --> 00:03:47.165
whatever the chronic illness is.

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:49.533
They also work with a health coach

00:03:49.557 --> 00:03:52.054
to learn self-management skills,

00:03:52.078 --> 00:03:55.899
skills that'll help them prevent
complications of their illness.

00:03:56.552 --> 00:03:59.503
In order for the coach to be successful,

00:03:59.527 --> 00:04:01.925
they have to be able to gain the trust

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.848
of the individual
that they're working with.

00:04:04.872 --> 00:04:07.193
We tested this application

00:04:07.217 --> 00:04:11.720
in clinics, where the health coaches
were medical assistants,

00:04:11.744 --> 00:04:13.823
and in a large urban church,

00:04:13.847 --> 00:04:17.595
where the health coaches were volunteers
from the health ministry.

00:04:18.694 --> 00:04:23.007
A year later, a third of the participants

00:04:23.031 --> 00:04:25.742
were able to acquire
three new self-management skills

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:28.932
and maintain them to the extent
that it was able to improve

00:04:28.956 --> 00:04:31.573
their blood pressures, their blood sugar

00:04:31.597 --> 00:04:33.279
and their exercise.

00:04:33.768 --> 00:04:36.843
Now, what was simple yet fascinating to us

00:04:36.867 --> 00:04:43.059
was that the group from the church
did just as well or even better

00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:45.964
than the group that were
under purely medical care.

00:04:45.988 --> 00:04:48.725
And we wanted to learn why that was.

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:51.270
So we looked a little further
into the research --

00:04:51.294 --> 00:04:54.403
400 hours of recorded conversation --

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:58.331
and what we learned was that
the coaches from the church

00:04:58.355 --> 00:05:01.969
did have more time to spend
with the patients,

00:05:01.993 --> 00:05:04.483
they had access to the patients' families,

00:05:04.507 --> 00:05:07.062
and so they could figure out
what people needed

00:05:07.086 --> 00:05:09.753
and provide those resources for them.

00:05:09.777 --> 00:05:13.634
My team and I call this
"culturally congruent coaching."

00:05:14.253 --> 00:05:17.374
To illustrate this concept
of culturally congruent coaching,

00:05:17.398 --> 00:05:19.532
I want to tell you about
one of our patients.

00:05:19.556 --> 00:05:21.185
I'll call her Ms. Bertha.

00:05:21.933 --> 00:05:26.278
So Ms. Bertha is an 83-year-old lady
with diabetes and hypertension.

00:05:26.302 --> 00:05:29.638
She was assigned to Anne,
her health coach in the church.

00:05:30.346 --> 00:05:34.050
Anne also happened to be a family friend
to Ms. Bertha for many years,

00:05:34.074 --> 00:05:36.005
and they were fellow congregants.

00:05:37.394 --> 00:05:40.113
Anne observed after the first few visits

00:05:40.137 --> 00:05:43.631
that even though Ms. Bertha
faithfully recorded her stats,

00:05:43.655 --> 00:05:46.019
they were all showing up as red.

00:05:46.043 --> 00:05:47.704
So she probed a little deeper

00:05:47.728 --> 00:05:50.476
to try to understand
what was going on with Ms. Bertha,

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.224
and Ms. Bertha gave her the real-real.

00:05:53.248 --> 00:05:54.855
(Laughter)

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:57.880
She told her that there were times

00:05:57.904 --> 00:06:00.391
when her medications made her feel weird,

00:06:00.415 --> 00:06:03.068
and she wouldn't take them
the way they were prescribed,

00:06:03.092 --> 00:06:05.356
because she thought
it was due to the medicines

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.353
but she didn't tell her doctor that.

00:06:07.377 --> 00:06:09.847
She also skipped out
on some doctor appointments

00:06:09.871 --> 00:06:11.068
for a variety of reasons,

00:06:11.092 --> 00:06:13.140
but one of them was
she wasn't doing better

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:15.246
and she didn't want
to make her doctor mad,

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.078
so she just didn't go.

00:06:17.102 --> 00:06:20.383
So Anne talked to Ms. Bertha

00:06:20.407 --> 00:06:23.866
and asked her to bring her daughter
in for the next visit, which she did.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.803
And at that visit,

00:06:25.827 --> 00:06:28.850
Anne was able to print out
a log of all these stats

00:06:28.874 --> 00:06:31.257
that Ms. Bertha had been collecting,

00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:34.521
gave them to her and encouraged them
to go see the doctor together,

00:06:34.545 --> 00:06:35.798
which they did.

00:06:35.822 --> 00:06:36.998
With that information,

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:40.550
the doctor was able to make changes
to Ms. Bertha's treatment.

00:06:40.574 --> 00:06:44.390
Within three months, Ms. Bertha's numbers
were all in the green.

00:06:44.414 --> 00:06:49.478
No one was more excited
or surprised than Ms. Bertha herself.

00:06:49.502 --> 00:06:52.350
Now, Anne was successful as a health coach

00:06:52.374 --> 00:06:55.928
because she cared enough
to go below the surface

00:06:55.952 --> 00:06:58.553
and probe Ms. Bertha's deep culture

00:06:58.577 --> 00:07:00.867
and was able to reach her at that level.

00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:02.298
She knew how to listen,

00:07:02.322 --> 00:07:04.343
and she knew how to ask
the right questions

00:07:04.367 --> 00:07:06.309
to get to what was needed.

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:09.663
We all have deep unconscious rules

00:07:09.687 --> 00:07:12.703
that drive the way we make
our health decisions.

00:07:12.727 --> 00:07:14.551
That's our culture.

00:07:14.575 --> 00:07:17.903
The relationship and the conversation
between Anne and Ms. Bertha

00:07:17.927 --> 00:07:20.660
illustrates what's possible

00:07:20.684 --> 00:07:24.339
when we have conversations
with our patients,

00:07:24.363 --> 00:07:26.396
our friends and our neighbors

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.820
on a deep cultural level.

00:07:27.844 --> 00:07:29.993
And personally, I'm beyond excited

00:07:30.017 --> 00:07:34.298
to think that with this simple concept
of culturally congruent coaching,

00:07:34.322 --> 00:07:37.875
we could change the lives
of 125 million Americans

00:07:37.899 --> 00:07:39.466
and many others across the world

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.931
that are living with chronic diseases.

00:07:41.955 --> 00:07:43.123
Thank you.

00:07:43.147 --> 00:07:47.150
(Applause)
