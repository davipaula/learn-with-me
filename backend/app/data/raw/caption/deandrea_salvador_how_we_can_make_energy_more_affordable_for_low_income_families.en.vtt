00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.340
So, as a child,

00:00:14.364 --> 00:00:17.469
I used to spend all of my time
at my great-grandmother's house.

00:00:17.914 --> 00:00:21.117
On hot, humid, summer days,
I would dash across the floor

00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:24.674
and stick my face in front of
her only air conditioner.

00:00:24.698 --> 00:00:27.863
But I didn't realize
that that simple experience,

00:00:27.887 --> 00:00:29.411
though brief,

00:00:29.435 --> 00:00:31.662
was a privileged one in our community.

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:36.690
Growing up, stories of next-door neighbors
having to set up fake energy accounts

00:00:36.714 --> 00:00:38.352
or having to steal energy

00:00:38.376 --> 00:00:40.031
seemed normal to me.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.551
During the winter, struggling to get warm,

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:45.431
my neighbors would have no choice
but to bypass the meter

00:00:45.455 --> 00:00:47.349
after their heat was shut off,

00:00:47.373 --> 00:00:50.883
just to keep their family
comfortable for one more day.

00:00:52.073 --> 00:00:54.651
These kinds of dangerous
incidents can take root

00:00:54.675 --> 00:00:57.386
when people are faced
with impossible choices.

00:00:57.772 --> 00:01:02.459
In the US, the average American spends
three percent of their income on energy.

00:01:02.483 --> 00:01:05.707
In contrast, low-income
and rural populations

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:10.576
can spend 20, even 30 percent
of their income on energy.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.521
In 2015, this caused over
25 million people to skip meals

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:17.645
to provide power to their homes.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.425
This is when energy becomes a burden.

00:01:21.173 --> 00:01:24.096
But energy burdens are so much more
than just a number.

00:01:24.673 --> 00:01:28.745
They present impossible
and perilous choices:

00:01:29.377 --> 00:01:31.827
Do you take your child
to get her flu medicine,

00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:33.601
or do you feed her?

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.005
Or do you keep her warm?

00:01:36.503 --> 00:01:38.269
It's an impossible choice,

00:01:38.293 --> 00:01:40.184
and nearly every month,

00:01:40.208 --> 00:01:44.471
seven million people choose
between medicine and energy.

00:01:45.248 --> 00:01:48.260
This exposes a much larger
and systemic issue.

00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:53.002
Families with high energy burdens
are disproportionately people of color,

00:01:53.026 --> 00:01:56.161
who spend more per square foot
than their white counterparts.

00:01:56.897 --> 00:01:59.833
But it's also nurses, veterans
and even schoolteachers

00:01:59.857 --> 00:02:03.344
who fall into the mass
of 37 million people a year

00:02:03.368 --> 00:02:07.164
who are unable to afford energy
for their most basic needs.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.948
As a result, those with
high energy burdens

00:02:09.972 --> 00:02:13.877
have a greater likelihood of conditions
like heart disease and asthma.

00:02:14.561 --> 00:02:19.821
Look -- given our rockets to Mars
and our pocket-sized AI,

00:02:19.845 --> 00:02:23.387
we have the tools to address
these systemic inequities.

00:02:23.411 --> 00:02:25.042
The technology is here.

00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:29.518
Cost of renewables, insulation,
microgrids and smart home technology

00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:31.136
are all decreasing.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.268
However, even as we approach cost parity,

00:02:34.292 --> 00:02:39.577
the majority of those who own solar
earn much more than the average American.

00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:43.496
This is why, when I was 22,
I founded the nonprofit RETI.

00:02:44.154 --> 00:02:48.883
Our mission is to alleviate energy burdens
by working with communities,

00:02:48.907 --> 00:02:51.461
utilities and government agencies alike

00:02:51.485 --> 00:02:54.361
to provide equitable access
to clean energy,

00:02:54.385 --> 00:02:57.127
energy efficiency and energy technology.

00:02:57.555 --> 00:03:00.499
But there's no one way to solve this.

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.813
I believe in the power
of local communities,

00:03:05.837 --> 00:03:08.828
in the transforming effect
of relationships.

00:03:09.264 --> 00:03:12.480
So we start by working directly
with the communities

00:03:12.504 --> 00:03:14.554
that have the highest energy burdens.

00:03:14.578 --> 00:03:16.688
We host workshops
and events for communities

00:03:16.712 --> 00:03:18.159
to learn about energy poverty,

00:03:18.183 --> 00:03:20.789
and how making even small
updates to their homes

00:03:20.813 --> 00:03:23.399
like better insulation for windows
and water heaters

00:03:23.423 --> 00:03:25.929
can go a long way to maximize efficiency.

00:03:26.232 --> 00:03:29.090
We're connecting neighborhoods
to community solar

00:03:29.114 --> 00:03:31.851
and spearheading community-led
smart home research

00:03:31.875 --> 00:03:33.574
and installation programs

00:03:33.598 --> 00:03:36.072
to help families bring down
their energy bills.

00:03:36.445 --> 00:03:38.995
We're even working directly
with elected officials,

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.737
advocating for more equitable pricing,

00:03:41.761 --> 00:03:46.899
because to see this vision
of energy equity and resilience succeed,

00:03:46.923 --> 00:03:50.420
we have to work together sustainably.

00:03:51.054 --> 00:03:53.551
Now, the US spends
over three billion a year

00:03:53.575 --> 00:03:55.786
on energy bill payment assistance.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.758
And these programs do help
millions of people,

00:03:58.782 --> 00:04:02.028
but they're only able to help
a fraction of those in need.

00:04:02.052 --> 00:04:03.267
In fact,

00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:09.017
there is a 47-billion-dollar
home-energy affordability gap,

00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:12.559
so assistance alone is not sustainable.

00:04:13.194 --> 00:04:17.463
But by building energy equity
and resilience into our communities,

00:04:17.487 --> 00:04:20.387
we can assure fair and impartial access

00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:23.430
to energy that is clean,
reliable and affordable.

00:04:23.454 --> 00:04:28.446
At scale, microgrid technology,
clean technology and energy efficiency

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.596
dramatically improve public health.

00:04:30.974 --> 00:04:33.382
And for those with high energy burdens,

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:36.581
it can help them reclaim
20 percent of their income --

00:04:37.049 --> 00:04:40.526
20 percent of a person's income
who's struggling to make ends meet.

00:04:41.001 --> 00:04:42.875
This is life-changing.

00:04:43.432 --> 00:04:48.428
This is an opportunity
for families to use their energy savings

00:04:48.452 --> 00:04:50.083
to sponsor their future.

00:04:51.093 --> 00:04:55.708
I think back to my great-grandmother
and her neighbors,

00:04:55.732 --> 00:04:58.964
the impossible choices
that they had to make

00:04:58.988 --> 00:05:01.309
and the effect it had
on our whole community.

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.815
But this is not just about them.

00:05:04.455 --> 00:05:09.475
There are millions nationwide having
to make the same impossible choices today.

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.022
And I know high energy burdens
are a tremendous barrier to overcome,

00:05:14.046 --> 00:05:18.439
but through relationships
with communities and technology,

00:05:18.463 --> 00:05:20.765
we have the paths to overcome them.

00:05:21.164 --> 00:05:23.159
And when we do,

00:05:23.183 --> 00:05:24.990
we will all be more resilient.

00:05:25.398 --> 00:05:26.549
Thank you.

00:05:26.573 --> 00:05:29.121
(Applause)
