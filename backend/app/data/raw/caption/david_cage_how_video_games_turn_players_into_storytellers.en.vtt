00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:17.559
The way we tell stories
has naturally changed

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:20.724
since Aristotle defined
the rules of tragedy

00:00:20.748 --> 00:00:23.169
about 2,500 years ago.

00:00:24.264 --> 00:00:26.296
According to him,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.991
the role of storytelling is to mimic life
and make us feel emotions.

00:00:32.015 --> 00:00:35.525
And that's exactly what
storytelling as we know it

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:37.145
has done very well since then.

00:00:38.053 --> 00:00:40.396
But there is a dimension of life

00:00:41.102 --> 00:00:44.035
that storytelling could
never really reproduce.

00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:47.686
It is the notion of choices.

00:00:48.385 --> 00:00:51.152
Choices are a very
important part of our lives.

00:00:51.176 --> 00:00:55.486
We as individuals are defined
by the choices we make.

00:00:55.854 --> 00:00:59.935
Some of our decisions can have
very significant consequences

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:02.225
and totally change
the courses of our lives.

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:07.111
But in a play, a novel or a film,

00:01:07.135 --> 00:01:11.263
the writer makes all the decisions
in advance for the characters,

00:01:11.287 --> 00:01:13.166
and as the audience,

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.844
we can only watch, passively,

00:01:15.868 --> 00:01:17.991
the consequences of his decisions.

00:01:19.518 --> 00:01:23.304
As a storyteller,
I've always been fascinated

00:01:23.328 --> 00:01:29.133
with the idea of recreating
this notion of choices in fiction.

00:01:29.157 --> 00:01:34.782
My dream was to put the audience
in the shoes of the main protagonists,

00:01:34.806 --> 00:01:36.547
let them make their own decisions,

00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:40.838
and by doing so,
let them tell their own stories.

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:48.359
Finding a way to achieve this is what
I did in the past 20 years of my life.

00:01:49.512 --> 00:01:54.706
Today, I would like to introduce you
to this new way of telling stories,

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.313
a way that has interactivity at its heart.

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:03.016
Rather than exposing the theory behind it,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.002
which could have been kind of abstract
and probably a little bit boring,

00:02:07.026 --> 00:02:12.730
I thought it would be a great opportunity
to do a little experiment.

00:02:13.684 --> 00:02:17.379
I would like you, the people here at TED,

00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:20.928
to tell your own story.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.687
So I came with an interactive scene
that we are going to play together.

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:29.497
I've asked Vicky --

00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:30.913
hello, Vicky --

00:02:30.937 --> 00:02:33.411
to control the main character for us.

00:02:33.435 --> 00:02:36.640
And your role -- you, the audience --

00:02:37.482 --> 00:02:40.278
will be to make the choices.

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:43.310
So Vicky and I don't know
what's going to happen,

00:02:43.334 --> 00:02:46.717
because it will all be based
on your decisions.

00:02:48.454 --> 00:02:54.776
This scene comes from our next game,
called "Detroit: Become Human,"

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.702
and we are in the near future,

00:02:58.376 --> 00:03:01.086
where technology made possible
the creation of androids

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.410
that look exactly like human beings.

00:03:03.434 --> 00:03:06.619
We are in the shoes
of this character called Connor,

00:03:06.643 --> 00:03:07.795
who is an android,

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.033
and he can do very fancy things
with coins, as you can see.

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:13.793
He has this blue triangle on this chest,

00:03:15.056 --> 00:03:18.030
as all androids do,

00:03:18.744 --> 00:03:21.508
and now Vicky is in control
of this character.

00:03:21.532 --> 00:03:25.086
She can walk around, she can go anywhere,
she can look around,

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.076
she can interact with her environment,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.894
and now she can tell her own stories
by making choices.

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:32.310
So here we have our first choice.

00:03:32.334 --> 00:03:34.273
There is a fish on the ground.

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:35.463
What should we do?

00:03:35.487 --> 00:03:37.505
Should we save it or should we leave it?

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:39.502
Remember, we are under time pressure,

00:03:39.526 --> 00:03:40.921
so we'd better be fast.

00:03:40.945 --> 00:03:42.118
What should we do?

00:03:42.142 --> 00:03:43.308
Audience: Save it!

00:03:43.332 --> 00:03:45.089
David Cage: Save it? Save the fish?

00:03:49.808 --> 00:03:50.958
(Video) (Fish plops)

00:03:50.982 --> 00:03:52.132
DC: There we go.

00:03:53.788 --> 00:03:56.002
OK, we have an android who likes animals.

00:03:56.026 --> 00:03:57.240
OK, let's move on.

00:03:57.264 --> 00:03:59.413
Remember, we have a hostage situation.

00:03:59.804 --> 00:04:03.281
(Video) Woman: Please, please,
you've got to save my little girl!

00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:06.948
Wait -- you're sending an android?

00:04:06.972 --> 00:04:09.004
Officer: All right, ma'am, you need to go.

00:04:09.028 --> 00:04:11.347
W: You can't do that!

00:04:11.371 --> 00:04:13.810
Why aren't you sending a real person?

00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:16.334
DC: OK, she's not really happy.

00:04:16.358 --> 00:04:18.864
Her daughter's been
taken hostage by an android,

00:04:18.888 --> 00:04:21.080
and of course, she's in a state of shock.

00:04:21.104 --> 00:04:23.406
Now we can continue
to explore this apartment.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.108
We see all the SWAT forces in place.

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:28.248
But we need to find
this Captain Allen first.

00:04:28.272 --> 00:04:30.053
That's the first thing we need to do.

00:04:30.077 --> 00:04:32.769
So, again, we can go anywhere.

00:04:32.793 --> 00:04:34.948
Vicky's still in control of the character.

00:04:34.972 --> 00:04:38.468
Let's see -- oh, I think this
is Captain Allen. He's on the phone.

00:04:39.735 --> 00:04:42.254
(Video) Connor: Captain Allen,
my name is Connor.

00:04:42.278 --> 00:04:44.284
I'm the android sent by CyberLife.

00:04:47.227 --> 00:04:49.658
Captain Allen: Let's fire
at everything that moves.

00:04:49.682 --> 00:04:51.470
It already shot down two of my men.

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:55.211
We could easily get it,
but they're on the edge of the balcony --

00:04:55.235 --> 00:04:56.420
it if falls,

00:04:56.444 --> 00:04:57.649
she falls.

00:04:57.673 --> 00:05:00.943
DC: OK, now we need to decide
what we want to ask the captain.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.211
What should be our choice?

00:05:02.235 --> 00:05:04.818
Deviant's name? Deviant's
behavior? Emotional shock?

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.478
(Video) C: Has it experienced
an emotional shock recently?

00:05:09.222 --> 00:05:11.445
Capt A: I haven't got
a clue. Does it matter?

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:14.045
C: I need information
to determine the best approach.

00:05:14.654 --> 00:05:17.386
DC: OK, a second choice.
Maybe we can learn something.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.563
What should we choose?

00:05:18.587 --> 00:05:19.758
Audience: Behavior.

00:05:19.782 --> 00:05:21.335
DC: OK, deviant behavior, Vicky.

00:05:21.359 --> 00:05:24.529
(Video) C: Do you know if it's been
behaving strangely before this?

00:05:24.553 --> 00:05:27.631
Capt A: Listen ... saving that kid
is all that matters.

00:05:29.054 --> 00:05:31.809
DC: OK, we are not going to learn
anything from this guy.

00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:33.386
We need to do something.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.636
Let's try to go back in the lobby.

00:05:37.806 --> 00:05:41.388
Oh, wait -- there's a room over there
on your right, Vicky, I think.

00:05:41.412 --> 00:05:43.420
Maybe there's something we can learn here.

00:05:44.015 --> 00:05:45.608
Oh, there's a tablet.

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.162
Let's have a look.

00:05:53.842 --> 00:05:57.129
(Video) Girl: This is Daniel,
the coolest android in the world.

00:05:57.153 --> 00:05:58.544
Say "Hi," Daniel.

00:05:58.568 --> 00:05:59.723
Daniel: Hello!

00:05:59.747 --> 00:06:02.155
G: You're my bestie,
we'll always be together!

00:06:02.855 --> 00:06:05.094
DC: That was just one way
of playing the scenes,

00:06:05.118 --> 00:06:07.794
but there are many
other ways of playing it.

00:06:07.818 --> 00:06:09.445
Depending on the choices you make,

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.518
we could have seen many different actions,

00:06:11.542 --> 00:06:13.300
many different consequences,

00:06:13.324 --> 00:06:15.414
many different outcomes.

00:06:15.851 --> 00:06:19.818
So that gives you an idea of what
my work is about as an interactive writer.

00:06:19.842 --> 00:06:24.167
Where a linear writer needs
to deal with time and space,

00:06:24.191 --> 00:06:25.672
as an interactive writer,

00:06:25.696 --> 00:06:29.763
I need to deal with time,
space and possibilities.

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:35.083
I have to manage massive tree structures,

00:06:35.107 --> 00:06:38.477
where each branch
is a new variation of the story.

00:06:38.501 --> 00:06:41.344
I need to think about all
the possibilities in a given scene

00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:43.633
and try to imagine
everything that can happen.

00:06:43.657 --> 00:06:48.528
I need to deal with thousands
and thousands of variables,

00:06:48.552 --> 00:06:50.747
conditions and possibilities.

00:06:50.771 --> 00:06:54.884
As a consequence, where a film script
is about 100 pages,

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:02.003
an interactive script like this
is between four and five thousand pages.

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:07.485
So that gives you an idea
of what this work is about.

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:12.940
But I think, in the end,
the experience is very unique,

00:07:12.964 --> 00:07:17.092
because it is the result
of the collaboration

00:07:17.116 --> 00:07:20.893
between a writer creating
this narrative landscape

00:07:22.326 --> 00:07:24.233
and the player making his own decisions,

00:07:24.257 --> 00:07:28.467
telling his own story
and becoming the cowriter

00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:32.466
but also the coactor
and the codirector of the story.

00:07:34.772 --> 00:07:39.973
Interactive storytelling is a revolution
in the way we tell stories.

00:07:39.997 --> 00:07:44.800
With the emergence of new platforms
like interactive television,

00:07:44.824 --> 00:07:46.657
virtual reality and video games,

00:07:46.681 --> 00:07:48.914
it can become a new form of entertainment

00:07:48.938 --> 00:07:52.574
and maybe even a new form of art.

00:07:53.427 --> 00:07:56.130
I am convinced that in the coming years,

00:07:56.154 --> 00:08:02.839
we will see more and more moving
and meaningful interactive experiences,

00:08:02.863 --> 00:08:05.411
created by a new generation of talents.

00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:09.086
This is a medium
waiting for its Orson Welles

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.882
or its Stanley Kubrick,

00:08:10.906 --> 00:08:14.870
and I have no doubt
that they will soon emerge

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:17.252
and be recognized as such.

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:21.107
I believe that interactive
storytelling can be

00:08:21.131 --> 00:08:23.760
what cinema was in the 20th century:

00:08:24.479 --> 00:08:27.807
an art that deeply changes its time.

00:08:28.676 --> 00:08:29.834
Thank you.

00:08:29.858 --> 00:08:32.576
(Applause)
