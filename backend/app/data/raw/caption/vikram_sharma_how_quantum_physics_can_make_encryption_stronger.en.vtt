00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:17.221
Recently, we've seen the effects
of cyber attacks on the business world.

00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:22.656
Data breaches at companies like JP Morgan,
Yahoo, Home Depot and Target

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.371
have caused losses of hundreds of millions

00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:28.242
and in some cases, billions of dollars.

00:00:28.792 --> 00:00:32.493
It wouldn't take many large attacks
to ravage the world economy.

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:36.379
And the public sector
has not been immune, either.

00:00:36.706 --> 00:00:40.474
In 2012 to 2014,

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:44.777
there was a significant data breach
at the US Office of Personnel Management.

00:00:45.157 --> 00:00:48.587
Security clearance
and fingerprint data was compromised,

00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:52.815
affecting 22 million employees.

00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:57.664
And you may have heard of the attempt
by state-sponsored hackers

00:00:57.688 --> 00:01:03.246
to use stolen data to influence election
outcomes in a number of countries.

00:01:03.624 --> 00:01:07.243
Two recent examples are
the compromise of a large amount of data

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:10.577
from the Bundestag,
the national Parliament of Germany,

00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:15.334
and the theft of emails from the US
Democratic National Committee.

00:01:16.807 --> 00:01:21.094
The cyber threat is now affecting
our democratic processes.

00:01:21.712 --> 00:01:23.645
And it's likely to get worse.

00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:27.879
As computer technology
is becoming more powerful,

00:01:27.903 --> 00:01:32.061
the systems we use to protect our data
are becoming more vulnerable.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:36.641
Adding to the concern
is a new type of computing technology,

00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:38.656
called quantum computing,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.633
which leverages microscopic
properties of nature

00:01:41.657 --> 00:01:45.566
to deliver unimaginable increases
in computational power.

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:50.482
It's so powerful that it will crack
many of the encryption systems

00:01:50.506 --> 00:01:51.706
that we use today.

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:54.855
So is the situation hopeless?

00:01:55.228 --> 00:01:58.085
Should we start packing
our digital survival gear

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:01.109
and prepare for an upcoming
data apocalypse?

00:02:02.283 --> 00:02:03.941
I would say, not yet.

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:06.411
Quantum computing is still in the labs,

00:02:06.435 --> 00:02:09.925
and it will take a few years
until it's put to practical applications.

00:02:10.347 --> 00:02:11.553
More important,

00:02:11.577 --> 00:02:15.063
there have been major breakthroughs
in the field of encryption.

00:02:15.497 --> 00:02:18.498
For me, this is
a particularly exciting time

00:02:18.522 --> 00:02:21.189
in the history of secure communications.

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.188
About 15 years ago,

00:02:23.212 --> 00:02:25.538
when I learned of our new-found ability

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:29.347
to create quantum effects
that don't exist in nature,

00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:30.790
I was excited.

00:02:30.814 --> 00:02:34.101
The idea of applying
the fundamental laws of physics

00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:35.856
to make encryption stronger

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.307
really intrigued me.

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.260
Today, a select groups of companies
and labs around the world, including mine,

00:02:44.284 --> 00:02:47.890
are maturing this technology
for practical applications.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.411
That's right.

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:52.902
We are now preparing
to fight quantum with quantum.

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:55.600
So how does this all work?

00:02:55.624 --> 00:02:59.235
Well, first, let's take a quick tour
of the world of encryption.

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:01.306
For that, you'll need a briefcase,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.321
some important documents that you want
to send your friend, James Bond,

00:03:05.345 --> 00:03:07.412
and a lock to keep it all safe.

00:03:08.122 --> 00:03:13.297
Because the documents are top secret,
we're going to use an advanced briefcase.

00:03:13.321 --> 00:03:15.385
It has a special combination lock

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:16.974
which, when closed,

00:03:16.998 --> 00:03:20.410
converts all the text
in the documents to random numbers.

00:03:20.434 --> 00:03:24.150
So you put your documents inside,
close the lock --

00:03:24.174 --> 00:03:27.656
at which point in time the documents
get converted to random numbers --

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.080
and you send the briefcase to James.

00:03:30.736 --> 00:03:33.966
While it's on its way,
you call him to give him the code.

00:03:34.387 --> 00:03:37.323
When he gets the briefcase,
he enters the code,

00:03:37.347 --> 00:03:40.331
the documents get unscrambled, and voilÃ ,

00:03:40.355 --> 00:03:44.204
you've just sent
an encoded message to James Bond.

00:03:44.228 --> 00:03:45.283
(Laughter)

00:03:45.966 --> 00:03:50.456
A fun example, but it does illustrate
three things important for encryption.

00:03:50.776 --> 00:03:53.617
The code -- we call this
an encryption key.

00:03:53.641 --> 00:03:55.743
You can think of it as a password.

00:03:56.093 --> 00:04:00.942
The call to James to give him
the code for the combination lock.

00:04:00.966 --> 00:04:02.997
We call this key exchange.

00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:04.935
This is how you ensure

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.728
you get the encryption key
securely to the right place.

00:04:09.164 --> 00:04:12.863
And the lock, which encodes
and decodes the document.

00:04:12.887 --> 00:04:15.506
We call this an encryption algorithm.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.498
Using the key, it encodes
the text in the documents

00:04:20.522 --> 00:04:21.918
to random numbers.

00:04:21.942 --> 00:04:24.704
A good algorithm will encode in such a way

00:04:24.728 --> 00:04:28.461
that without the key
it's very difficult to unscramble.

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:31.522
What makes encryption so important

00:04:31.546 --> 00:04:35.282
is that if someone were to capture
the briefcase and cut it open

00:04:35.306 --> 00:04:38.568
without the encryption key
and the encryption algorithm,

00:04:38.592 --> 00:04:41.108
they wouldn't be able
to read the documents.

00:04:41.132 --> 00:04:45.282
They would look like nothing more
than a bunch of random numbers.

00:04:46.575 --> 00:04:51.424
Most security systems rely
on a secure method for key exchange

00:04:51.448 --> 00:04:55.915
to communicate the encryption key
to the right place.

00:04:56.862 --> 00:04:59.838
However, rapid increases
in computational power

00:04:59.862 --> 00:05:04.227
are putting at risk a number
of the key exchange methods we have today.

00:05:04.776 --> 00:05:09.236
Consider one of the very
widely used systems today -- RSA.

00:05:09.855 --> 00:05:13.156
When it was invented, in 1977,

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.680
it was estimated that it would take
40 quadrillion years

00:05:17.704 --> 00:05:21.240
to break a 426-bit RSA key.

00:05:22.006 --> 00:05:26.339
In 1994, just 17 years later,

00:05:26.363 --> 00:05:27.894
the code was broken.

00:05:29.355 --> 00:05:31.926
As computers have become
more and more powerful,

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.617
we've had to use larger and larger codes.

00:05:35.117 --> 00:05:41.115
Today we routinely use 2048 or 4096 bits.

00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:46.862
As you can see, code makers and breakers
are engaged in an ongoing battle

00:05:46.886 --> 00:05:48.680
to outwit each other.

00:05:50.553 --> 00:05:54.649
And when quantum computers arrive
in the next 10 to 15 years,

00:05:54.673 --> 00:05:58.859
they will even more rapidly
crack the complex mathematics

00:05:58.883 --> 00:06:02.573
that underlies many
of our encryption systems today.

00:06:03.034 --> 00:06:08.442
Indeed, the quantum computer is likely
to turn our present security castle

00:06:08.466 --> 00:06:11.053
into a mere house of cards.

00:06:12.815 --> 00:06:16.315
We have to find a way
to defend our castle.

00:06:17.474 --> 00:06:20.077
There's been a growing
body of research in recent years

00:06:20.101 --> 00:06:23.322
looking at using quantum effects
to make encryption stronger.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.027
And there have been
some exciting breakthroughs.

00:06:27.474 --> 00:06:30.403
Remember those three things
important for encryption --

00:06:30.427 --> 00:06:35.320
high-quality keys, secure key exchange
and a strong algorithm?

00:06:35.831 --> 00:06:38.498
Well, advances in science and engineering

00:06:38.522 --> 00:06:41.759
are putting two of those
three elements at risk.

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.315
First of all, those keys.

00:06:45.006 --> 00:06:49.236
Random numbers are the foundational
building blocks of encryption keys.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.839
But today, they're not truly random.

00:06:52.641 --> 00:06:55.379
Currently, we construct encryption keys

00:06:55.403 --> 00:06:59.212
from sequences of random numbers
generated from software,

00:06:59.236 --> 00:07:01.799
so-called pseudo-random numbers.

00:07:02.712 --> 00:07:06.029
Numbers generated by a program
or a mathematical recipe

00:07:06.053 --> 00:07:09.814
will have some, perhaps subtle,
pattern to them.

00:07:10.784 --> 00:07:12.336
The less random the numbers are,

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.704
or in scientific terms,
the less entropy they contain,

00:07:15.728 --> 00:07:17.795
the easier they are to predict.

00:07:18.917 --> 00:07:22.839
Recently, several casinos
have been victims of a creative attack.

00:07:22.863 --> 00:07:27.212
The output of slot machines
was recorded over a period of time

00:07:27.236 --> 00:07:28.593
and then analyzed.

00:07:28.982 --> 00:07:30.950
This allowed the cyber criminals

00:07:30.974 --> 00:07:34.641
to reverse engineer
the pseudo-random number generator

00:07:34.665 --> 00:07:36.664
behind the spinning wheels.

00:07:36.688 --> 00:07:41.995
And allowed them, with high accuracy,
to predict the spins of the wheels,

00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:45.486
enabling them to make big financial gains.

00:07:47.122 --> 00:07:50.280
Similar risks apply to encryption keys.

00:07:50.815 --> 00:07:55.975
So having a true random number generator
is essential for secure encryption.

00:07:57.815 --> 00:08:03.069
For years, researchers have been looking
at building true random number generators.

00:08:03.093 --> 00:08:06.466
But most designs to date
are either not random enough,

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:09.223
fast enough or aren't easily repeatable.

00:08:10.053 --> 00:08:13.204
But the quantum world is truly random.

00:08:13.546 --> 00:08:18.537
So it makes sense to take advantage
of this intrinsic randomness.

00:08:20.165 --> 00:08:22.077
Devices that can measure quantum effects

00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:26.031
can produce an endless stream
of random numbers at high speed.

00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:29.421
Foiling all those
would-be casino criminals.

00:08:30.485 --> 00:08:34.062
A select group of universities
and companies around the world

00:08:34.086 --> 00:08:37.508
are focused on building
true random number generators.

00:08:37.895 --> 00:08:41.553
At my company, our quantum
random number generator

00:08:41.577 --> 00:08:45.364
started life on a two meter
by one meter optic table.

00:08:46.085 --> 00:08:49.889
We were then able to reduce it
to a server-size box.

00:08:50.736 --> 00:08:56.508
Today, it's miniaturized into a PCI card
that plugs into a standard computer.

00:08:59.482 --> 00:09:03.616
This is the world's fastest
true random number generator.

00:09:04.053 --> 00:09:09.126
It measures quantum effects to produce
a billion random numbers per second.

00:09:09.877 --> 00:09:13.226
And it's in use today to improve security

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.924
at cloud providers, banks
and government agencies

00:09:16.948 --> 00:09:18.098
around the world.

00:09:18.788 --> 00:09:25.716
(Applause)

00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:29.887
But even with a true
random number generator,

00:09:29.911 --> 00:09:32.807
we've still got the second
big cyber threat:

00:09:32.831 --> 00:09:35.513
the problem of secure key exchange.

00:09:36.315 --> 00:09:40.867
Current key exchange techniques
will not stand up to a quantum computer.

00:09:41.865 --> 00:09:43.794
The quantum solution to this problem

00:09:43.818 --> 00:09:47.518
is called quantum key distribution or QKD,

00:09:47.893 --> 00:09:52.228
which leverages a fundamental,
counterintuitive characteristic

00:09:52.252 --> 00:09:53.652
of quantum mechanics.

00:09:54.077 --> 00:09:58.984
The very act of looking
at a quantum particle changes it.

00:10:00.173 --> 00:10:02.492
Let me give you an example
of how this works.

00:10:02.927 --> 00:10:07.634
Consider again exchanging the code
for the lock with James Bond.

00:10:07.974 --> 00:10:12.132
Except this time, instead of a call
to give James the code,

00:10:12.156 --> 00:10:16.204
we're going to use quantum effects
on a laser to carry the code

00:10:16.228 --> 00:10:20.137
and send it over standard
optic fiber to James.

00:10:20.774 --> 00:10:25.123
We assume that Dr. No
is trying to hack the exchange.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:31.773
Luckily, Dr. No's attempt to intercept
the quantum keys while in transit

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:35.463
will leave fingerprints
that James and you can detect.

00:10:36.043 --> 00:10:39.511
This allows those intercepted keys
to be discarded.

00:10:40.026 --> 00:10:41.783
The keys which are then retained

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:45.152
can be used to provide
very strong data protection.

00:10:45.815 --> 00:10:50.101
And because the security is based
on the fundamental laws of physics,

00:10:50.125 --> 00:10:54.188
a quantum computer, or indeed
any future supercomputer

00:10:54.212 --> 00:10:56.146
will not be able to break it.

00:10:56.768 --> 00:10:59.704
My team and I are collaborating
with leading universities

00:10:59.728 --> 00:11:01.022
and the defense sector

00:11:01.046 --> 00:11:03.482
to mature this exciting technology

00:11:03.506 --> 00:11:06.639
into the next generation
of security products.

00:11:07.895 --> 00:11:13.633
The internet of things
is heralding a hyperconnected era

00:11:13.657 --> 00:11:19.775
with 25 to 30 billion
connected devices forecast by 2020.

00:11:20.569 --> 00:11:25.680
For the correct functioning
of our society in an IoT world,

00:11:25.704 --> 00:11:30.532
trust in the systems that support
these connected devices is vital.

00:11:31.704 --> 00:11:36.527
We're betting that quantum technologies
will be essential in providing this trust,

00:11:36.887 --> 00:11:41.446
enabling us to fully benefit
from the amazing innovations

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.368
that are going to so enrich our lives.

00:11:46.046 --> 00:11:47.196
Thank you.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:52.150
(Applause)
