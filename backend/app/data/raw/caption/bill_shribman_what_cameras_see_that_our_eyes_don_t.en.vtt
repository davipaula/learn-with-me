00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.492
The human eye is one of the most powerful machines

00:00:17.492 --> 00:00:18.705
on the planet.

00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:21.149
It's like a 500 megapixel camera

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:23.133
that can run in bright light,

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.437
in near darkness,

00:00:24.437 --> 00:00:27.142
and even under water, though not real well.

00:00:27.142 --> 00:00:28.843
It communicates to our brains

00:00:28.843 --> 00:00:30.690
so much about the world.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.021
Our eyes are how we find partners,

00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:34.995
how we understand the people around us,

00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:36.273
how we read,

00:00:36.273 --> 00:00:38.194
and how we watch game shows on TV

00:00:38.194 --> 00:00:39.992
where people get knocked into cold water

00:00:39.992 --> 00:00:41.929
by padded wrecking balls.

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:43.499
Yup, the human eye is pretty neat,

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:45.740
and we're lucky enough to have two of them.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.692
But, there are things that,

00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:48.196
despite looking really hard,

00:00:48.196 --> 00:00:50.322
we still can't quite see.

00:00:50.322 --> 00:00:52.283
For example, you can watch a horse galloping,

00:00:52.283 --> 00:00:54.954
but your eyes can't keep up with its fast-moving hooves

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:56.712
enough to figure out whether all four feet

00:00:56.712 --> 00:00:59.121
are ever off the ground simultaneously.

00:01:00.197 --> 00:01:03.501
For these types of questions, we need cameras.

00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:05.418
About 150 years ago,

00:01:05.418 --> 00:01:07.388
the photographer Eadweard Muybridge used one

00:01:07.388 --> 00:01:10.175
to solve the galloping horse mystery.

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:11.559
Using careful photography,

00:01:11.559 --> 00:01:14.765
Muybridge proved that at certain points as it gallops,

00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:17.556
a horse really is flying.

00:01:17.556 --> 00:01:19.927
"Look, ma! No hooves!"

00:01:19.927 --> 00:01:22.653
Since then, photography has found its way

00:01:22.653 --> 00:01:25.815
into all aspects of math and science.

00:01:25.815 --> 00:01:28.025
It enhances our understanding of a world

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:29.835
we thought we could already see,

00:01:29.835 --> 00:01:31.858
but it's one which we really need help

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:33.701
to see a little better.

00:01:33.701 --> 00:01:35.356
It's not always a matter of the world

00:01:35.356 --> 00:01:38.757
moving by too quickly for our eyes to process.

00:01:38.757 --> 00:01:41.220
Sometimes cameras can help us see matter or movements

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.125
that are too small for the naked eye.

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:46.058
Botanists use multiple photographs

00:01:46.058 --> 00:01:48.190
to show the life cycle of plants

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.602
and how flowers turn over the course of a few hours

00:01:50.602 --> 00:01:54.273
to follow the sun in what is called phototropism,

00:01:54.273 --> 00:01:56.486
growing towards the light.

00:01:56.486 --> 00:01:58.321
Mathematicians have used photos

00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:00.894
to look at where in the twists and turns of a whip

00:02:00.894 --> 00:02:02.563
the crack sound comes

00:02:02.563 --> 00:02:04.940
when the whip is breaking the sound barrier.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.461
Meteorologists and environmental scientists

00:02:07.461 --> 00:02:09.382
show the growth of major hurricanes

00:02:09.382 --> 00:02:11.197
and the recession over the years

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:13.325
of many of the world's glaciers.

00:02:13.325 --> 00:02:15.590
Slow-motion film or high-speed photography

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.237
have shown us the beating of a hummingbird's wings

00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:20.999
and the course of a bullet through its target.

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.043
In one project, cadavers,

00:02:23.043 --> 00:02:24.418
that's dead bodies,

00:02:24.418 --> 00:02:28.011
were frozen and sliced into thousands of wafer-thin discs.

00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:29.508
The discs were photographed

00:02:29.508 --> 00:02:31.102
to produced animated movies

00:02:31.102 --> 00:02:34.576
that allow a viewer to travel up and down the skeleton,

00:02:34.576 --> 00:02:35.972
and into the flesh,

00:02:35.972 --> 00:02:37.019
and through the bones,

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:37.848
and the veins,

00:02:37.848 --> 00:02:39.010
and,

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.349
perhaps I should have suggested

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.234
you don't watch this during dinner,

00:02:42.234 --> 00:02:43.761
my bad.

00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:45.384
In classrooms today, the camera,

00:02:45.384 --> 00:02:48.241
now present in just about every phone and computer,

00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:50.176
allows the youngest scientists

00:02:50.176 --> 00:02:51.570
to observe the world around them,

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.989
to document it,

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.127
and to share their findings online.

00:02:55.127 --> 00:02:56.658
Whether it's the change of seasons

00:02:56.658 --> 00:02:58.916
or the growth of the germinating seed,

00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:01.747
cameras are allowing us to see a beautiful world

00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:03.710
through new eyes.
