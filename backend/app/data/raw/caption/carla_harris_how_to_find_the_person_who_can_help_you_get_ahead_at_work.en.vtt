00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.576
It was the spring of 1988

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.776
when I had the aha moment.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.336
I was at my first roundtable,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.216
and for those of you who don't know,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.175
the roundtable was a very
commonly used phrase on Wall Street

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.416
to describe the year-end
evaluative process

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.896
for analysts, associates, vice presidents,
all the way up to managing directors.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.176
That was the process where they
were discussed behind closed doors

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.176
around a table, i.e. the round table,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.696
and everyone was put into a category --

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.376
the top bucket, the middle bucket,
the lower bucket --

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.336
and then that was translated
into a bonus range

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.256
that would be assigned
to each professional.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.696
This was my first time there,
and as I observed,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.016
I saw that there was one person
that was responsible

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.296
for recording the outcome
of a conversation.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.296
There were other people in the room
that had the responsibility

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.536
of presenting the cases
of all the candidates.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.696
And there were other invited guests
who were supposed to comment

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.720
as a candidate's position was presented.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.096
It was interesting to me
that those other people

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.856
were folks who were more senior
than the folks that were being discussed

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.216
and they theoretically had had
some interaction with those candidates.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.056
Now, I was really excited to be
at this roundtable for the first time,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.656
because I knew that my own process
would go through this same way,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.736
and that my bonus would be
decided in the same way,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.576
so I wanted to know how it worked,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.136
but more importantly,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.776
I wanted to understand
how this concept of a meritocracy

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.216
that every company that I talked to
walking out of business school

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.456
was selling.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.096
Every time I talked to a company,

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.296
they would say, "Our culture,
our process, is a meritocracy.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.336
The way you get ahead in this organization
is that you're smart,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.616
you put your head down
and you work really hard,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.256
and you'll go right to the top.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.616
So here was my opportunity to see
exactly how that worked.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.776
So as the process began,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.096
I heard the recorder
call the first person's name.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.816
"Joe Smith."

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.136
The person responsible
for presenting Joe's case did just that.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.176
Three quarters of the way through,
someone interrupted and said,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.456
"This is a great candidate, outstanding,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.296
has great analytical
and quantitative skills.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.136
This is a superstar."

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.656
The recorder then said,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.760
"Sounds like Joe
should go in the top bucket."

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.536
Second person, Mary Smith.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.376
Halfway through that presentation,
someone said, "Solid candidate.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.416
Nothing really special,
but a good pair of hands."

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.776
The recorder said,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.416
"Sounds like Mary
should go in the middle bucket."

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.176
And then someone said, "Arnold Smith."

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.456
Before the person
could present Arnold's case,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.296
somebody said, "Disaster. Disaster.
This kid doesn't have a clue.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.656
Can't do a model."

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.176
And before the case was presented,

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.496
the recorder said,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.736
"Sounds like Arnold
should go in the bottom bucket."

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.176
It was at that moment
that I clutched my pearls --

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.496
(Laughter)

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.000
and said, "Who is going to speak for me?"

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.496
Who is going to speak for me?

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.896
It was that moment that I realized
that this idea of a meritocracy

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.456
that every organizations sells
is really just a myth.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.536
You cannot have a 100 percent
meritocratic environment

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.936
when there is a human element
involved in the evaluative equation,

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.816
because by definition,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.336
that makes it subjective.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.816
I knew at that moment that somebody
would have to be behind closed doors

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.536
arguing on my behalf,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.536
presenting content in such a way

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.936
that other decision makers
around that table

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.240
would answer in my best favor.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.936
That was a really interesting lesson,

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.136
and then I said to myself,
"Well, who is that person?

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.016
What do you call this person?"

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.776
And as I thought about
the popular business terms at the time,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.256
I said, wow, this person
can't be a mentor,

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.896
because a mentor's job
is to give you tailored advice,

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.736
tailored specifically to you
and to your career aspirations.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.055
They're the ones who give you
the good, the bad and the ugly

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:29.839
in a no-holds-barred way.

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:35.016
OK. Person can't be
a champion or an advocate,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.616
because you don't necessarily
have to spend any currency

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.296
to be someone's champion.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.896
You don't necessarily
get invited to the room

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.976
behind closed doors if you're an advocate.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.096
It was almost two years later

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.816
when I realized what
this person should be called.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.336
I was speaking
at the University of Michigan

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.256
to the MBA candidates,

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.376
talking about the lessons
that I had learned

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.456
after my three short years on Wall Street,

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.056
and then it came to me.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.816
I said, "Oh, this person
that is carrying your interest,

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.016
or as I like to say,
carrying your paper into the room,

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.576
this person who is spending

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.976
their valuable political
and social capital on you,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.056
this person who is going
to pound the table on your behalf,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.560
this is a sponsor.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.040
This is a sponsor."

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.936
And then I said to myself,

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.496
"Well, how do you get a sponsor?

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.136
And frankly, why do you need one?"

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.936
Well, you need a sponsor, frankly,

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.336
because as you can see,

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.656
there's not one evaluative process
that I can think of,

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.296
whether it's in academia,
health care, financial services,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.640
not one that does not have
a human element.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.096
So that means it has
that measure of subjectivity.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.696
There is a measure of subjectivity
in who is presenting your case.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.776
There is a measure of subjectivity

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.856
in what they say

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:02.656
and how they interpret
any objective data that you might have.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.376
There is a measure of subjectivity
in how they say what they're going to say

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.656
to influence the outcome.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.936
So therefore, you need to make sure
that that person who is speaking,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.416
that sponsor,

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.696
has your best interests at heart

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.776
and has the power to get it,
whatever it is for you,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.216
to get it done behind closed doors.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.896
Now, I'm asked all the time,

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.976
"How do you get one?"

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.136
Well, frankly, nirvana is when
someone sees you in an environment

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.216
and decides, "I'm going
to make it happen for you.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.016
I'm going to make sure
that you are successful."

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.856
But for many of us in this room,
we know it doesn't really happen that way.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.256
So let me introduce
this concept of currency

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.256
and talk to you about how it impacts
your ability to get a sponsor.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.736
There are two types of currency
in any environment:

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.416
performance currency
and relationship currency.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.056
And performance currency
is the currency that is generated

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.736
by your delivering that
which was asked of you

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.696
and a little bit extra.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.376
Every time you deliver upon an assignment
above people's expectations,

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.496
you generate performance currency.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.376
It works exactly like the stock market.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.576
Any time a company says to the street

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.776
that they will deliver 25 cents a share

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.056
and that company delivers
40 cents a share,

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.520
that stock goes up, and so will yours.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.056
Performance currency
is valuable for three reasons.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.456
Number one, it will get you noticed.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.936
It will create a reputation for you.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.096
Number two, it will also
get you paid and promoted

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.536
very early on in your career

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.576
and very early on in any environment.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.576
And number three,
it may attract a sponsor.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.576
Why? Because strong performance currency

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.696
raises your level of visibility
in the environment, as I said earlier,

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.216
such that a sponsor
may be attracted to you.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.600
Why? Because everybody loves a star.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.456
But if you find yourself in a situation

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.696
where you don't have a sponsor,

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:15.216
here's the good news.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.120
Remember that you can exercise
your power and ask for one.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:25.296
But here's where the other currency
is now most important.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.976
That is the relationship currency,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.736
and relationship currency
is the currency that is generated

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.936
by the investments that you make
in the people in your environment,

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.456
the investments that you make
in the people in your environment.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.416
You cannot ask someone
to use their hard-earned

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.496
personal influential
currency on your behalf

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.216
if you've never had
any interaction with them.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.039
It is not going to happen.

00:08:53.559 --> 00:08:59.016
So it is important that you invest
the time to connect, to engage

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.096
and to get to know the people
that are in your environment,

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.776
and more importantly to give them
the opportunity to know you.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.816
Because once they know you,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.256
there's a higher probability
that when you approach them

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.616
to ask them to be your sponsor,

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.376
they will in fact answer
in the affirmative.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.256
Now, if you're with me and you agree
that you have to have a sponsor,

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:26.200
let's talk about how
you identify a sponsor.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.976
Well, if you're looking for a sponsor,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.136
they need to have
three primary characteristics.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.416
Number one, they need to have
a seat at the decision-making table,

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.496
they need to have exposure to your work

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.136
in order to have credibility
behind closed doors,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.856
and they need to have some juice,

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.736
or let me say it differently,
they'd better have some power.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.216
It's really important
that they have those three things.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.976
And then once you have
identified the person,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.056
how do you ask for one?

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.736
The script goes like this.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:03.616
"Jim, I'm really interested
in getting promoted this year.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.176
I've had an amazing year

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:11.736
and I cannot show this organization
anything else to prove my worthiness

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.976
or my readiness for this promotion,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.216
but I am aware that somebody
has to be behind closed doors

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.256
arguing on my behalf
and pounding the table.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.216
You know me, you know my work
and you are aware of the client feedback,

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:29.336
and I hope that you will feel comfortable
arguing on my behalf."

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.976
If Jim knows you

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.496
and you have any kind of a relationship,

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.936
there's a very high probability
that he will answer yes,

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.296
and if he says yes,

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.696
he will endeavor to get it done for you.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.736
But there's also a shot
that Jim might say no,

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.656
and if he says no, in my opinion,

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.416
there's only three reasons
that he would tell you no.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:53.016
The first is he doesn't think
that he has enough exposure to your work

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.136
to have real credibility
behind closed doors

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.776
to be impactful and effective
on your behalf.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.776
The second reason he may tell you no

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.176
is that you think
he has the juice to get it done,

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.416
but he knows that he does not
have the power to do it

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.696
and he is not going to admit that
in that conversation with you.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.856
(Laughter)

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.536
And the third reason
that he would tell you no,

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.776
he doesn't like you.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.016
He doesn't like you.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.176
(Laughter)

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.496
And that's something that could happen.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.816
But even that will be
valuable information for you

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.896
that will help to inform
your next conversation with a sponsor

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.360
that might make it
a little bit more impactful.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.656
I cannot tell you how important
it is to have a sponsor.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.976
It is the critical relationship
in your career.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.856
A mentor, frankly, is a nice to have,

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.896
but you can survive a long time
in your career without a mentor,

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:54.496
but you are not going to ascend
in any organization without a sponsor.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.896
It is so critical that you
should ask yourself regularly,

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.536
"Who's carrying my paper into the room?

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.936
Who is carrying my paper into the room?"

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.696
And if you can't answer
who is carrying your paper into the room,

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.216
then I will tell you to divert
some of your hardworking energies

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.496
into investing in a sponsor relationship,

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.696
because it will be critical
to your success.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.536
And as I close, let me give a word

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.720
to the would-be sponsors
that are in the room.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.736
If you have been invited into the room,

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.016
know that you have a seat at that table,

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.496
and if you have a seat at the table,

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.176
you have a responsibility to speak.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:40.176
Don't waste your power worrying
about what people are going to say

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.296
and whether or not they think
you might be supporting someone

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.736
just because they look like you.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.960
If somebody is worthy of your currency,

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.616
spend it.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.696
One thing I have learned
after several decades on Wall Street

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.136
is the way to grow your power
is to give it away,

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.376
and your voice is at the heart.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:05.360
(Applause)

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:11.160
And your voice
is at the heart of your power.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.176
Use it.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.416
Thank you very much.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:20.600
(Applause)
