Audrey Tang: Very happy to be joining you,

00:00:14.596 --> 00:00:16.362
and good local time, everyone.

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:20.402
David Biello: So, tell us about --

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.110
Sorry to --

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.890
Tell us about digital tools and COVID.

00:00:26.196 --> 00:00:27.347
AT: Sure.

00:00:27.371 --> 00:00:29.738
Yeah, I'm really happy to share with you

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:32.542
how Taiwan successfully
countered the COVID

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:35.402
using the power
of digital democracy tools.

00:00:36.101 --> 00:00:39.728
As we know, democracy improves
as more people participate.

00:00:39.752 --> 00:00:44.245
And digital technology remains one
of the best ways to improve participation,

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:46.658
as long as the focus
is on finding common ground,

00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:50.785
that is to say, prosocial media
instead of antisocial media.

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.490
And there's three key ideas
that I would like to share today

00:00:54.514 --> 00:00:58.863
about digital democracy
that is fast, fair and fun.

00:01:00.277 --> 00:01:02.283
First about the fast part.

00:01:02.307 --> 00:01:06.021
Whereas many jurisdictions began
countering coronavirus only this year,

00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:07.871
Taiwan started last year.

00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:11.569
Last December, when Dr. Li Wenliang,
the PRC whistleblower,

00:01:11.593 --> 00:01:14.307
posted that there are new SARS cases,

00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:16.609
he got inquiries
and eventually punishments

00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:18.648
from PRC police institutions.

00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:20.108
But at the same time,

00:01:20.132 --> 00:01:23.069
the Taiwan equivalent
of Reddit, the Ptt board,

00:01:23.093 --> 00:01:24.926
has someone called nomorepipe

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.744
reposting Dr. Li Wenliang's
whistleblowing.

00:01:27.768 --> 00:01:30.733
And our medical officers
immediately noticed this post

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.312
and issued an order that says

00:01:32.336 --> 00:01:35.018
all passengers flying in
from Wuhan to Taiwan

00:01:35.042 --> 00:01:37.487
need to start health inspections
the very next day,

00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:39.574
which is the first day of January.

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:41.450
And this says to me two things.

00:01:41.474 --> 00:01:43.983
First, the civil society
trusts the government enough

00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:46.974
to talk about possible
new SARS outbreaks in the public forum.

00:01:46.998 --> 00:01:48.965
And the government trusts citizens enough

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:52.220
to take it seriously and treat it
as if SARS has happened again,

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:55.514
something we've always
been preparing for, since 2003.

00:01:55.538 --> 00:01:57.895
And because of this open civil society,

00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:01.783
according to the CIVICUS Monitor
after the Sunflower Occupy,

00:02:01.807 --> 00:02:04.970
Taiwan is now the most open society
in the whole of Asia.

00:02:04.994 --> 00:02:07.800
We enjoy the same freedom
of speech, of assembly,

00:02:07.824 --> 00:02:10.291
[unclear] as other liberal democracies,

00:02:10.315 --> 00:02:12.522
but with the emphasis
on keeping an open mind

00:02:12.546 --> 00:02:15.395
to novel ideas from the society.

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.919
And that is why our schools
and businesses still remain open today,

00:02:18.943 --> 00:02:20.172
there was no lockdown,

00:02:20.196 --> 00:02:22.751
it's been a month
with no local confirmed cases.

00:02:23.513 --> 00:02:24.663
So the fast part.

00:02:24.997 --> 00:02:28.268
Every day, our Central Epidemic
Command Center, or CECC,

00:02:28.292 --> 00:02:30.935
holds a press conference,
which is always livestreamed,

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.602
and we work with the journalists,

00:02:32.626 --> 00:02:35.037
they answer all the questions
from the journalists,

00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:38.149
and whenever there's a new idea
coming in from the social sector,

00:02:38.173 --> 00:02:40.299
anyone can pick up
their phone and call 1922

00:02:40.323 --> 00:02:42.458
and tell that idea to the CECC.

00:02:42.482 --> 00:02:44.752
For example, there was one day in April

00:02:44.776 --> 00:02:47.744
where a young boy has said
he doesn't want to go to school

00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:49.728
because his school mates may laugh at him

00:02:49.752 --> 00:02:52.458
because all he had is a pink medical mask.

00:02:52.482 --> 00:02:53.657
The very next day,

00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:57.672
everybody in the CECC press conference
started wearing pink medical masks,

00:02:57.696 --> 00:03:00.630
making sure that everybody learns
about gender mainstreaming.

00:03:00.654 --> 00:03:02.670
And so this kind of rapid response system

00:03:02.694 --> 00:03:05.704
builds trust between the government
and the civil society.

00:03:05.728 --> 00:03:07.569
And the second focus is fairness.

00:03:07.593 --> 00:03:10.729
Making sure everybody can use
their national health insurance card

00:03:10.753 --> 00:03:12.696
to collect masks from nearby pharmacies,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.291
not only do we publish the stock level
of masks of all pharmacies,

00:03:16.315 --> 00:03:17.481
6,000 of them,

00:03:17.505 --> 00:03:20.077
we publish it every 30 seconds.

00:03:20.101 --> 00:03:24.092
That's why our civic hackers,
our civil engineers in the digital space,

00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:28.250
built more than 100 tools
that enable people to view a map,

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:32.156
or people with blindness
who talk to chat bots, voice assistants,

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.297
all of them can get the same
inclusive access to information

00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:38.051
about which pharmacies near them
still have masks.

00:03:38.075 --> 00:03:40.789
And because the national
health insurance single payer

00:03:40.813 --> 00:03:43.980
is more than 99.9 percent
of health coverage,

00:03:44.004 --> 00:03:45.458
people who show any symptoms

00:03:45.482 --> 00:03:47.641
will then be able to take
the medical mask,

00:03:47.665 --> 00:03:48.950
go to a local clinic,

00:03:48.974 --> 00:03:51.205
knowing fully that they will
get treated fairly

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:53.267
without incurring any financial burden.

00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:54.934
And so people designed a dashboard

00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.498
that lets everybody see
our supply is indeed growing,

00:03:57.522 --> 00:03:59.752
and whether there's over- or undersupply,

00:03:59.776 --> 00:04:02.315
so that we codesign
this distribution system

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:04.760
with the pharmacies,
with the whole of society.

00:04:04.784 --> 00:04:06.783
So based on this analysis,

00:04:06.807 --> 00:04:10.677
we show that there was
a peak at 70 percent,

00:04:10.701 --> 00:04:14.955
and that remaining 20 percent of people
were often young, work very long hours,

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.917
when they go off work,
the pharmacies also went off work,

00:04:17.941 --> 00:04:20.184
and so we work with convenience stores

00:04:20.208 --> 00:04:22.520
so that everybody can collect
their mask anytime,

00:04:22.544 --> 00:04:23.955
24 hours a day.

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.737
So we ensure fairness of all kinds,

00:04:25.761 --> 00:04:28.561
based on the digital democracy's feedback.

00:04:29.074 --> 00:04:32.680
And finally, I would like to acknowledge
that this is a very stressful time.

00:04:32.704 --> 00:04:34.998
People feel anxious, outraged,

00:04:35.022 --> 00:04:36.467
there's a lot of panic buying,

00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:39.315
a lot of conspiracy theories
in all economies.

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:40.512
And in Taiwan,

00:04:40.536 --> 00:04:43.330
our counter-disinformation
strategy is very simple.

00:04:43.354 --> 00:04:45.866
It's called "humor over rumor."

00:04:46.196 --> 00:04:49.220
So when there was a panic buying
of tissue paper, for example,

00:04:49.244 --> 00:04:50.680
there was a rumor that says,

00:04:50.704 --> 00:04:52.537
"Oh, we're ramping up mass production,

00:04:52.561 --> 00:04:54.474
it's the same material as tissue papers,

00:04:54.498 --> 00:04:56.879
and so we'll run out
of tissue paper soon."

00:04:56.903 --> 00:05:00.868
And our premier showed
a very memetic picture

00:05:00.892 --> 00:05:02.727
that I simply have to share with you.

00:05:02.751 --> 00:05:04.116
In very large print,

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.623
he shows his bottom,

00:05:06.647 --> 00:05:08.839
wiggling it a little bit,

00:05:08.863 --> 00:05:10.887
and then the large print says

00:05:10.911 --> 00:05:13.707
"Each of us only have
one pair of buttocks."

00:05:13.731 --> 00:05:16.744
And of course, the serious table shows

00:05:16.768 --> 00:05:19.704
that tissue paper came
from South American materials,

00:05:19.728 --> 00:05:21.950
and medical masks
come from domestic materials,

00:05:21.974 --> 00:05:24.418
and there's no way that ramping up
production of one

00:05:24.442 --> 00:05:26.791
will hurt the production of the other.

00:05:26.815 --> 00:05:28.847
And so that went absolutely viral.

00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:31.228
And because of that,
the panic buying died down

00:05:31.252 --> 00:05:32.688
in a day or two.

00:05:32.712 --> 00:05:36.332
And finally, we found out the person
who spread the rumor in the first place

00:05:36.356 --> 00:05:37.791
was the tissue paper reseller.

00:05:37.815 --> 00:05:40.553
And this is not just
a single shock point in social media.

00:05:40.577 --> 00:05:41.734
Every single day,

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:43.776
the daily press conference gets translated

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.455
by the spokesdog of the Ministry
of Health and Welfare,

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:48.658
that translated a lot of things.

00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:52.609
For example, our physical distancing
is phrased as saying

00:05:52.633 --> 00:05:55.730
"If you are outdoors,
you need to keep two dog-lengths away,

00:05:55.754 --> 00:05:58.794
if you are indoor,
three dog-lengths away," and so on.

00:05:58.818 --> 00:06:00.863
And hand sanitation rules, and so on.

00:06:00.887 --> 00:06:02.712
So because all this goes viral,

00:06:02.736 --> 00:06:06.029
we make sure that the factual humor
spreads faster than rumor.

00:06:06.053 --> 00:06:08.651
And they serve as a vaccine,
as inoculation,

00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:10.958
so that when people see
the conspiracy theories,

00:06:10.982 --> 00:06:13.093
the R0 value of that will be below one,

00:06:13.117 --> 00:06:15.919
meaning that those ideas will not spread.

00:06:15.943 --> 00:06:18.610
And so I only have
this five-minute briefing,

00:06:18.634 --> 00:06:21.078
the rest of it will be driven
by your Q and A,

00:06:21.102 --> 00:06:22.713
but please feel free to read more

00:06:22.737 --> 00:06:25.421
about Taiwan's
counter-coronavirus strategy,

00:06:25.445 --> 00:06:27.164
at taiwancanhelp.us.

00:06:27.188 --> 00:06:28.338
Thank you.

00:06:31.109 --> 00:06:32.783
DB: That's incredible.

00:06:32.807 --> 00:06:37.233
And I love this "humor versus rumor."

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:40.242
The problem here in the US, perhaps,

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:45.415
is that the rumors seem to travel
faster than any response,

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:46.645
whether humorous or not.

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:50.334
How do you defeat that aspect in Taiwan?

00:06:51.527 --> 00:06:53.670
AT: Yeah, we found that, of course,

00:06:53.694 --> 00:06:57.340
humor implicitly means
there is a sublimation

00:06:57.364 --> 00:07:00.934
of upsetness, of outrage.

00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:04.934
And so as you see, for example,
in our premier's example,

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.029
he makes fun of himself.

00:07:07.053 --> 00:07:10.849
He doesn't make a joke
at the expense of other people.

00:07:10.873 --> 00:07:12.357
And this was the key.

00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:14.286
Because people think it hilarious,

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.460
they share it,

00:07:15.484 --> 00:07:18.428
but with no malicious or toxic intentions.

00:07:18.452 --> 00:07:20.378
People remember the actual payload,

00:07:20.402 --> 00:07:23.355
that table about materials
used to produce masks,

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:24.550
much more easily.

00:07:24.574 --> 00:07:28.930
If they make a joke
that excludes parts of the society,

00:07:28.954 --> 00:07:31.550
of course, that part of society
will feel outraged

00:07:31.574 --> 00:07:33.907
and we will end up
creating more divisiveness,

00:07:33.931 --> 00:07:36.074
rather than prosocial behavior.

00:07:36.098 --> 00:07:39.410
So the humor at no expense,

00:07:39.434 --> 00:07:42.144
not excluding any part of society,

00:07:42.168 --> 00:07:43.835
I think that was the key.

00:07:45.847 --> 00:07:47.044
DB: It's also incredible

00:07:47.068 --> 00:07:52.854
because Taiwan has such close ties
to the origin point of this.

00:07:52.878 --> 00:07:54.045
AT: PRC, yes.

00:07:54.069 --> 00:07:55.235
DB: The mainland.

00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:59.204
So given those close economic ties,

00:07:59.228 --> 00:08:03.021
how do you survive
that kind of disruption?

00:08:04.919 --> 00:08:08.425
AT: Yeah, I mean, at this moment,

00:08:08.449 --> 00:08:11.887
it's been almost a month now
with no local confirmed cases,

00:08:11.911 --> 00:08:13.141
so we're doing fine.

00:08:13.165 --> 00:08:14.832
And what we are doing, essentially,

00:08:14.856 --> 00:08:18.641
is just to respond faster
than pretty much anyone.

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:21.260
We started responding last year,

00:08:21.284 --> 00:08:24.624
whereas pretty much everybody else
started responding this year.

00:08:24.648 --> 00:08:27.909
We tried to warn the world
last year, but, anyway.

00:08:27.933 --> 00:08:29.086
So in any case,

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.848
the point here is
that if you start early enough,

00:08:31.872 --> 00:08:35.355
you get to make sure
that the border control

00:08:35.379 --> 00:08:40.823
is the main point where you quarantine
all the returning residents and so on,

00:08:40.847 --> 00:08:43.786
instead of waiting until
the community spread stage,

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:47.672
where even more human-right
invading techniques

00:08:47.696 --> 00:08:50.402
would probably have to be deployed
one way or the other.

00:08:50.426 --> 00:08:53.682
And so in Taiwan, we've not declared
an emergency situation.

00:08:53.706 --> 00:08:56.285
We're firmly under the constitutional law.

00:08:56.309 --> 00:08:59.095
Because of that, every measure
the administration is taking

00:08:59.119 --> 00:09:01.609
is also applicable
in non-coronavirus times.

00:09:01.633 --> 00:09:03.704
And this forces us to innovate.

00:09:03.728 --> 00:09:07.992
Much as the idea of
"we are an open liberal democracy"

00:09:08.016 --> 00:09:10.318
prevented us from doing takedowns.

00:09:10.342 --> 00:09:13.532
And therefore, we have to innovate
of humor versus rumor,

00:09:13.556 --> 00:09:16.268
because the easy path,
the takedown of online speech,

00:09:16.292 --> 00:09:18.283
is not accessible to us.

00:09:18.307 --> 00:09:21.481
Our design criteria,
which is no lockdowns,

00:09:21.505 --> 00:09:25.132
also prevented us
from doing any, you know,

00:09:25.156 --> 00:09:28.507
very invasive privacy encroaching
response system.

00:09:28.531 --> 00:09:30.389
So we have to innovate at the border,

00:09:30.413 --> 00:09:33.396
and make sure that we have
a sufficient number of, for example,

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.872
quarantine hotels
or the so-called "digital fences,"

00:09:35.896 --> 00:09:40.529
where your phone is basically connected
to the nearby telecoms,

00:09:40.553 --> 00:09:45.347
and they make sure that if they go out
of the 15-meter or so radius,

00:09:45.371 --> 00:09:50.114
an SMS is sent to the local
household managers or police and so on.

00:09:50.138 --> 00:09:53.052
But because we focus
all these measures at the border,

00:09:53.076 --> 00:09:55.686
the vast majority of people
live a normal life.

00:09:57.267 --> 00:09:59.130
DB: Let's talk about that a little bit.

00:09:59.154 --> 00:10:01.497
So walk me through the digital tools

00:10:01.521 --> 00:10:04.219
and how they were applied to COVID.

00:10:05.196 --> 00:10:06.362
AT: Yes.

00:10:06.386 --> 00:10:09.791
So there's three parts
that I just outlined.

00:10:09.815 --> 00:10:12.887
The first one is the collective
intelligence system.

00:10:12.911 --> 00:10:14.402
Through online spaces

00:10:14.426 --> 00:10:18.387
that we design to be devoid
of Reply buttons,

00:10:18.411 --> 00:10:21.228
because we see that,
when there's Reply buttons,

00:10:21.252 --> 00:10:25.448
people focus on each other's
face part, not the book part,

00:10:25.472 --> 00:10:27.006
and without "Reply" buttons,

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.085
you can get collective intelligence

00:10:29.109 --> 00:10:34.156
working out their rough consensus
of where the direction is going

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.783
with the response strategies.

00:10:35.807 --> 00:10:37.656
So we use a lot of new technologies,

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.831
such as Polis,

00:10:38.855 --> 00:10:42.473
which is essentially a forum
that lets you upvote and downvote

00:10:42.497 --> 00:10:44.934
each other's feelings,

00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:46.926
but with real-time clustering,

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.641
so that if you go to cohack.tw,

00:10:49.665 --> 00:10:51.732
you see six such conversations,

00:10:51.756 --> 00:10:54.721
talking about how to protect
the most vulnerable people,

00:10:54.745 --> 00:10:56.348
how to make a smooth transition,

00:10:56.372 --> 00:10:59.815
how to make a fair
distribution of supplies and so on.

00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:02.299
And people are free to voice their ideas,

00:11:02.323 --> 00:11:04.625
and upvote and downvote
each other's ideas.

00:11:04.649 --> 00:11:08.434
But the trick is that we show people
the main divisive points,

00:11:08.458 --> 00:11:09.958
and the main consensual points,

00:11:09.982 --> 00:11:12.276
and we respond only to the ideas

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.053
that can convince
all the different opinion groups.

00:11:15.077 --> 00:11:19.017
So people are encouraged
to post more eclectic, more nuanced ideas

00:11:19.041 --> 00:11:22.326
and they discover,
at the end of this consultation,

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.684
that everybody, actually,
agrees with most things,

00:11:24.708 --> 00:11:27.406
with most of their neighbors
on most of the issues.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.895
And that is what we call
the social mandate,

00:11:29.919 --> 00:11:31.339
or the democratic mandate,

00:11:31.363 --> 00:11:35.299
that then informs our development
of the counter-coronavirus strategy

00:11:35.323 --> 00:11:37.911
and helping the world with such tools.

00:11:37.935 --> 00:11:39.397
And so this is the first part,

00:11:39.421 --> 00:11:42.476
it's called listening at scale
for rough consensus.

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.040
The second part I already covered
is the distribute ledger,

00:11:46.064 --> 00:11:48.306
where everybody can go
to a nearby pharmacy,

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:52.029
present their NHI card,
buy nine masks, or 10 if you're a child,

00:11:52.053 --> 00:11:55.323
and see the stock level
of that pharmacy on their phone

00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:59.029
actually decreasing by nine or 10
in a couple of minutes.

00:11:59.053 --> 00:12:01.141
And if they grow by nine or 10,

00:12:01.165 --> 00:12:02.653
of course, you call the 1922,

00:12:02.677 --> 00:12:04.887
and report something fishy is going on.

00:12:04.911 --> 00:12:07.241
But this is participatory accountability.

00:12:07.265 --> 00:12:08.998
This is published every 30 seconds.

00:12:09.022 --> 00:12:11.069
So everybody holds each other accountable,

00:12:11.093 --> 00:12:13.196
and that massively increases trust.

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.557
And finally, the third one,
the humor versus rumor,

00:12:16.581 --> 00:12:19.403
I think the important thing to see here

00:12:19.427 --> 00:12:22.967
is that wherever there's a trending
disinformation or conspiracy theory,

00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:25.410
you respond to it with a humorous package

00:12:25.434 --> 00:12:26.696
within two hours.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.487
We have discovered,
if we respond within two hours,

00:12:29.511 --> 00:12:33.543
then more people see the vaccination
than the conspiracy theory.

00:12:33.567 --> 00:12:37.255
But if you respond four hours
or a day afterwards,

00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:38.472
then that's a lost cause.

00:12:38.496 --> 00:12:41.767
You can't really counter that
using humor anymore,

00:12:41.791 --> 00:12:45.156
you have to invite the person
who spread those messages

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.783
into cocreation workshops.

00:12:46.807 --> 00:12:48.607
But we're OK with that, too.

00:12:49.807 --> 00:12:51.276
DB: Your speed is incredible.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.336
I see Whitney has joined us
with some questions.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.856
Whitney Pennington Rodgers: That's right,

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.234
we have a few coming in already
from the audience.

00:12:59.258 --> 00:13:00.440
Hi there, Audrey.

00:13:00.464 --> 00:13:04.140
And we'll start with one
from our community member Michael Backes.

00:13:04.164 --> 00:13:08.117
He asks how long has humor
versus rumor been a strategy

00:13:08.141 --> 00:13:09.333
that you've implemented.

00:13:09.357 --> 00:13:10.508
Excuse me.

00:13:10.532 --> 00:13:13.318
"How long has humor versus rumor
strategy been implemented?

00:13:13.342 --> 00:13:17.056
Were comedians consulted
to make the humor?"

00:13:17.713 --> 00:13:18.904
AT: Yes, definitely.

00:13:18.928 --> 00:13:22.391
Comedians are our most
cherished colleagues.

00:13:22.415 --> 00:13:27.522
And each and every ministry has a team
of what we call participation officers

00:13:27.546 --> 00:13:31.283
in charge of engaging
with trending topics.

00:13:31.307 --> 00:13:34.031
And it's a more than 100
people-strong team now.

00:13:34.055 --> 00:13:36.623
We meet every month
and also every couple of weeks

00:13:36.647 --> 00:13:38.472
on specific topics.

00:13:38.496 --> 00:13:42.987
It's been like that since late 2016,

00:13:43.011 --> 00:13:47.172
but it's not until our previous
spokesperson, Kolas Yotaka,

00:13:47.196 --> 00:13:49.862
joined about a year and a half ago,

00:13:49.886 --> 00:13:52.418
do the professional comedians
get to the team.

00:13:52.442 --> 00:13:58.659
Previously, this was more about inviting
the people who post, you know,

00:13:58.683 --> 00:14:03.350
quotes like "Our tax filing system
is explosively hostile,"

00:14:03.374 --> 00:14:04.526
and gets trending,

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:07.492
and previously, the POs
just invited those people.

00:14:07.516 --> 00:14:09.049
Everybody who complains

00:14:09.073 --> 00:14:11.412
about the finance minister's
tax-filing experience

00:14:11.436 --> 00:14:14.411
gets invited to the cocreation
of that tax filing experience.

00:14:14.435 --> 00:14:15.746
So previously, it was that.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.854
But Kolas Yotaka and the premier
Su Tseng-chang said,

00:14:18.878 --> 00:14:21.132
wouldn't it be much better
and reach more people

00:14:21.156 --> 00:14:24.371
if we add some dogs to it
or cat's pictures to it?

00:14:24.395 --> 00:14:26.880
And that's been around
for a year and a half.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.320
WPR: Definitely, I think it makes
a lot of difference, just even seeing them

00:14:32.344 --> 00:14:35.371
without being part
of the thought process behind that.

00:14:35.395 --> 00:14:39.925
And we have another question here
from G. Ryan Ansin.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.751
He asks, "What would you rank
the level of trust

00:14:43.775 --> 00:14:45.695
your community had before the pandemic,

00:14:45.719 --> 00:14:47.846
in order for the government
to have a chance

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:50.337
at properly controlling this crisis?"

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:54.023
AT: I would say that a community
trusts each other.

00:14:54.047 --> 00:14:56.787
And that is the main point
of digital democracy.

00:14:56.811 --> 00:14:59.569
This is not about people
trusting the government more.

00:14:59.593 --> 00:15:02.601
This is about the government
trusting the citizens more,

00:15:02.625 --> 00:15:05.093
making the state transparent
to the citizen,

00:15:05.117 --> 00:15:07.101
not the citizen transparent to the state,

00:15:07.125 --> 00:15:08.807
which would be some other regime.

00:15:08.831 --> 00:15:11.046
So making the state
transparent to the citizens

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:13.299
doesn't always elicit more trust,

00:15:13.323 --> 00:15:15.982
because you may see something wrong,
something missing,

00:15:16.006 --> 00:15:18.918
something exclusively hostile
to its user experience,

00:15:18.942 --> 00:15:20.466
an so on, of the state.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:23.751
So it doesn't necessarily lead
to more trust from the government.

00:15:23.775 --> 00:15:25.799
Sorry, from the citizen to the government.

00:15:25.823 --> 00:15:29.600
But it always leads to more trust
between the social sector stakeholders.

00:15:29.624 --> 00:15:32.721
So I would say the level of trust
between the people

00:15:32.745 --> 00:15:35.277
who are working on, for example,

00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:37.627
medical officers,

00:15:37.651 --> 00:15:40.983
and people who are working
with the pandemic responses,

00:15:41.007 --> 00:15:42.879
people who manufacture medical masks,

00:15:42.903 --> 00:15:44.069
and so on,

00:15:44.093 --> 00:15:45.259
all these people,

00:15:45.283 --> 00:15:47.443
the trust level between them is very high.

00:15:47.467 --> 00:15:50.197
And not necessarily
they trust the government.

00:15:50.221 --> 00:15:53.664
But we don't need that
for a successful response.

00:15:53.688 --> 00:15:55.704
If you ask a random person on the street,

00:15:55.728 --> 00:15:59.695
they will say Taiwan is performing so well
because of the people.

00:15:59.719 --> 00:16:01.894
When the CECC tells us to wear the mask,

00:16:01.918 --> 00:16:03.086
we wear the mask.

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.163
When the CECC tells us not to wear a mask,

00:16:05.187 --> 00:16:07.203
like, if you are keeping
physical distance,

00:16:07.227 --> 00:16:08.821
we wear a mask anyway.

00:16:08.845 --> 00:16:10.227
And so because of that,

00:16:10.251 --> 00:16:14.300
I think it's the social sector's trust
between those different stakeholders

00:16:14.324 --> 00:16:16.245
that's the key to the response.

00:16:18.094 --> 00:16:20.579
WPR: I will come back shortly
with more questions,

00:16:20.603 --> 00:16:23.332
but I'll leave you guys
to continue your conversation.

00:16:23.356 --> 00:16:24.823
AT: Awesome.

00:16:24.847 --> 00:16:28.780
DB: Well, clearly,
part of that trust in government

00:16:28.804 --> 00:16:34.434
was maybe not there in 2014
during the Sunflower Movement.

00:16:34.458 --> 00:16:36.918
So talk to me about that

00:16:36.942 --> 00:16:42.028
and how that led to this,
kind of, digital transformation.

00:16:43.535 --> 00:16:44.703
AT: Indeed.

00:16:44.727 --> 00:16:50.976
Before March 2014, if you asked
a random person on the street in Taiwan,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.355
like, whether it's possible
for a minister -- that's me --

00:16:55.379 --> 00:16:58.909
to have their office in a park,
literally a park,

00:16:58.933 --> 00:17:02.245
anyone can walk in and talk to me
for 40 minutes at a time,

00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:05.118
I'm currently in that park,
the Social Innovation Lab,

00:17:05.142 --> 00:17:07.158
they would say that this is crazy, right?

00:17:07.182 --> 00:17:09.418
No public officials work like that.

00:17:09.442 --> 00:17:13.141
But that was because on March 18, 2014,

00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:15.950
hundreds of young activists,
most of them college students,

00:17:15.974 --> 00:17:17.466
occupied the legislature

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:21.208
to express their profound opposition
to a trade pact with Beijing

00:17:21.232 --> 00:17:22.831
under consideration,

00:17:22.855 --> 00:17:26.661
and the secretive manner in which
it was pushed through the parliament

00:17:26.685 --> 00:17:28.876
by Kuomintang,
the ruling party at the time.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.003
And so the protesters
demanded, very simply,

00:17:31.027 --> 00:17:32.569
that the pact be scraped,

00:17:32.593 --> 00:17:36.467
and the government to institute
a more transparent ratification process.

00:17:36.783 --> 00:17:38.895
And that drew widespread public support.

00:17:38.919 --> 00:17:41.617
It ended a little more
than three weeks later,

00:17:41.641 --> 00:17:44.609
after the government promised and agreed

00:17:44.633 --> 00:17:49.387
on the four demands [unclear]
of legislative oversight.

00:17:49.411 --> 00:17:51.561
A poll released after the occupation

00:17:51.585 --> 00:17:55.390
showed that more than 75 percent
remained dissatisfied

00:17:55.414 --> 00:17:56.760
with the ruling government,

00:17:56.784 --> 00:18:00.876
illustrating the crisis of trust
that was caused by a trade deal dispute.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.309
And to heal this rift
and communicate better

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:04.544
with everyday citizens,

00:18:04.568 --> 00:18:08.498
the administration reached out
to the people who supported the occupiers,

00:18:08.522 --> 00:18:11.307
for example, the g0v community,

00:18:11.331 --> 00:18:14.006
which has been seeking
to improve government transparency

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:16.100
through the creation of open-source tools.

00:18:16.124 --> 00:18:19.236
And so, Jaclyn Tsai,
a government minister at the time,

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.712
attended our hackathon

00:18:20.736 --> 00:18:24.085
and proposed the establishment
of novel platforms

00:18:24.109 --> 00:18:27.299
with the online community
to exchange policy ideas.

00:18:27.323 --> 00:18:30.336
And an experiment was born called vTaiwan,

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.074
that pioneerly used tools such as Polis,

00:18:33.098 --> 00:18:36.514
that allows for "agree" or "disagree"
with no Reply button,

00:18:36.538 --> 00:18:40.926
that gets people's rough consensus
on issues such as crowdfunding,

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:43.387
equity-based crowdfunding, to be precise,

00:18:43.411 --> 00:18:46.831
teleworking and many other
cyber-related legislation,

00:18:46.855 --> 00:18:49.831
of which there is no existing
unions or associations.

00:18:49.855 --> 00:18:51.827
And it proved to be very successful.

00:18:51.851 --> 00:18:54.955
They solved the Uber problem, for example,

00:18:54.979 --> 00:18:56.836
and by now, you can call an Uber --

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.656
I just called an Uber this week --

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.578
but in any case,
they are operating as taxis.

00:19:02.602 --> 00:19:05.808
They set up a local
taxi company called Q Taxi,

00:19:05.832 --> 00:19:09.669
and that was because on the platform,
people cared about insurance,

00:19:09.693 --> 00:19:11.143
they care about registration,

00:19:11.167 --> 00:19:15.281
they care about all the sort of,
protection of the passengers, and so on.

00:19:15.305 --> 00:19:17.934
So we changed the taxi regulations,

00:19:17.958 --> 00:19:20.831
and now Uber is just another taxi company

00:19:20.855 --> 00:19:22.855
along with the other co-ops.

00:19:23.871 --> 00:19:26.009
DB: So you're actually, in a way,

00:19:26.033 --> 00:19:30.813
crowdsourcing laws
that, well, then become laws.

00:19:31.464 --> 00:19:34.035
AT: Yeah, learn more at crowd.law.

00:19:34.059 --> 00:19:35.467
It's a real website.

00:19:36.568 --> 00:19:40.683
DB: So, some might say
that this seems easier,

00:19:40.707 --> 00:19:43.533
because Taiwan is an island,

00:19:43.557 --> 00:19:46.744
that maybe helps you control COVID,

00:19:46.768 --> 00:19:48.907
helps promote social cohesion,

00:19:48.931 --> 00:19:53.042
maybe it's a smaller country than some.

00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:56.800
Do you think that this could be
scaled beyond Taiwan?

00:19:58.182 --> 00:19:59.428
AT: Well, first of all,

00:19:59.452 --> 00:20:02.198
23 million people
is still quite some people.

00:20:02.222 --> 00:20:03.760
It's not a city,

00:20:03.784 --> 00:20:08.283
as some usually say, you know,
"Taiwan is a city-state."

00:20:08.307 --> 00:20:12.003
Well, 23 million people,
not quite a city-state.

00:20:12.027 --> 00:20:13.622
And what I'm trying to get at,

00:20:13.646 --> 00:20:18.685
is that the high population density
and a variety of cultures --

00:20:18.709 --> 00:20:21.317
we have more than 20 national languages --

00:20:21.341 --> 00:20:26.206
doesn't necessarily lead
to social cohesion, as you said.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:31.295
Rather, I think, this is the humbleness
of all the ministers

00:20:31.319 --> 00:20:34.053
in the counter-coronavirus response.

00:20:34.077 --> 00:20:39.272
They all took on an attitude
of "So we learned about SARS" --

00:20:39.296 --> 00:20:42.485
many of them were in charge
of the SARS back then,

00:20:42.509 --> 00:20:44.757
but that was classical epidemiology.

00:20:44.781 --> 00:20:47.910
This is SARS 2.0,
it has different characteristics.

00:20:47.934 --> 00:20:50.077
And the tools that we use
are very different,

00:20:50.101 --> 00:20:51.934
because of the digital transformation.

00:20:51.958 --> 00:20:55.320
And so we are in it to learn
together with the citizens.

00:20:55.344 --> 00:20:58.328
Our vice president at the time,

00:20:58.352 --> 00:21:00.455
Dr. Chen Chien-jen, an academician,

00:21:00.479 --> 00:21:03.680
literally wrote the textbook
on epidemiology.

00:21:03.704 --> 00:21:06.047
However, he still says,

00:21:06.071 --> 00:21:09.252
"You know, what I'm going to do
is record an online MOOC,

00:21:09.276 --> 00:21:11.244
a crash course on epidemiology,

00:21:11.268 --> 00:21:12.491
that shares with,

00:21:12.515 --> 00:21:15.133
I think, more than 20,00 people
enrolled the first day,

00:21:15.157 --> 00:21:16.329
I was among them,

00:21:16.353 --> 00:21:17.831
to learn about important ideas,

00:21:17.855 --> 00:21:22.101
like the R0 and the basic transmission

00:21:22.125 --> 00:21:24.601
and how the various
different measures work,

00:21:24.625 --> 00:21:26.801
and then they asked people to innovate.

00:21:26.825 --> 00:21:31.409
If you think of a new way
that the vice president did not think of,

00:21:31.433 --> 00:21:32.719
just call 1922,

00:21:32.743 --> 00:21:35.901
and your idea will become
the next day's press conference.

00:21:35.925 --> 00:21:38.569
And this is this colearning strategy,

00:21:38.593 --> 00:21:42.736
I think, that more than anything
enabled the social cohesion,

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.967
as you speak.

00:21:43.991 --> 00:21:47.832
But this is more of a robust
civil society than the uniformity.

00:21:47.856 --> 00:21:50.330
There's no uniformity at all in Taiwan,

00:21:50.354 --> 00:21:52.439
everybody is entitled to their ideas,

00:21:52.463 --> 00:21:53.968
and all the social innovations,

00:21:53.992 --> 00:21:56.468
ranging from using
a traditional rice cooker

00:21:56.492 --> 00:21:59.383
to revitalize, to disinfect the mask,

00:21:59.407 --> 00:22:01.228
to pink medical mask, and so on,

00:22:01.252 --> 00:22:03.537
there's all variety
of very interesting ideas

00:22:03.561 --> 00:22:06.236
that get amplified
by the daily press conference.

00:22:07.685 --> 00:22:10.167
DB: That's beautiful.

00:22:10.748 --> 00:22:12.598
Now -- oh, Whitney is back,

00:22:12.622 --> 00:22:14.900
so I will let her ask the next question.

00:22:16.293 --> 00:22:18.753
WPR: Sure, we're having
some more questions come in.

00:22:18.777 --> 00:22:21.642
One from our community member Aria Bendix.

00:22:21.666 --> 00:22:26.028
Aria asked, "How do you ensure
that digital campaigns act quickly

00:22:26.052 --> 00:22:27.829
without sacrificing accuracy?

00:22:27.853 --> 00:22:31.609
In the US, there was a fear
of inciting panic about COVID-19

00:22:31.633 --> 00:22:33.233
in early January."

00:22:34.684 --> 00:22:36.779
AT: This is a great question.

00:22:36.803 --> 00:22:43.733
So most of the scientific ideas
about the COVID are evolving, right?

00:22:44.046 --> 00:22:48.574
The efficacy of masks, for example,
is a very good example,

00:22:48.598 --> 00:22:53.943
because the different characteristics
of previous respiratory diseases

00:22:53.967 --> 00:22:56.279
respond differently to the facial mask.

00:22:56.303 --> 00:22:58.255
And so, our digital campaigns

00:22:58.279 --> 00:23:02.461
focus on the idea of getting
the rough consensus through.

00:23:02.485 --> 00:23:04.734
So basically, it's a reflection
of the society,

00:23:04.758 --> 00:23:08.585
through Polis, through Slido,
through the joint platform,

00:23:08.609 --> 00:23:11.068
the various tools
that vTaiwan has prototyped,

00:23:11.092 --> 00:23:14.591
we know that people are feeling
a rough consensus about things

00:23:14.615 --> 00:23:17.501
and we're responding
to the society, saying,

00:23:17.525 --> 00:23:19.458
"This is what you all feel

00:23:19.482 --> 00:23:22.276
and this is what we're doing
to respond to your feelings.

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.045
And the scientific consensus
is still developing,

00:23:25.069 --> 00:23:26.474
but we know, for example,

00:23:26.498 --> 00:23:30.268
people feel that wearing a mask
mostly protects you,

00:23:30.292 --> 00:23:32.863
because it reminds you
to not touch your face

00:23:32.887 --> 00:23:34.449
and wash your hands properly."

00:23:34.473 --> 00:23:36.768
And these, regardless of everything else,

00:23:36.792 --> 00:23:38.950
are the two things
that everybody agrees with.

00:23:38.974 --> 00:23:41.156
So we just capitalize on that and say,

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.085
"OK, wash your hands properly,

00:23:43.109 --> 00:23:44.395
and don't touch your face,

00:23:44.419 --> 00:23:46.383
and wearing a mask reminds you of that."

00:23:46.407 --> 00:23:47.907
And that lets us cut through

00:23:47.931 --> 00:23:51.145
the kind of, very ideologically
charged debates

00:23:51.169 --> 00:23:55.172
and focus on what people
generally resonate with one another.

00:23:55.196 --> 00:23:58.791
And that's how we act quickly
without sacrificing scientific accuracy.

00:24:01.012 --> 00:24:04.536
WPR: And this next question
sort of feels connected to this as well.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.545
It's a question from an anonymous
community member.

00:24:07.569 --> 00:24:09.891
"Pragmatically, do you think
any of your policies

00:24:09.915 --> 00:24:13.764
could be applied in the United States
under the current Trump administration?"

00:24:13.788 --> 00:24:15.042
AT: Quite a few, actually.

00:24:15.066 --> 00:24:19.744
We work with many states
in the US and abroad

00:24:19.768 --> 00:24:25.347
on what we call "epicenter
to epicenter diplomacy." (Laughs)

00:24:25.371 --> 00:24:28.276
So what we're doing essentially is,

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.479
for example,
there was a chat bot in Taiwan

00:24:30.503 --> 00:24:33.860
that lets you, but especially
people under home quarantine,

00:24:33.884 --> 00:24:35.950
to ask the chat bot anything.

00:24:35.974 --> 00:24:38.743
And if there is a scientific adviser

00:24:38.767 --> 00:24:41.145
who already wrote
a frequently asked question,

00:24:41.169 --> 00:24:42.938
the chat bot just responds with that,

00:24:42.962 --> 00:24:46.352
but otherwise, they will call
the science advisory board

00:24:46.376 --> 00:24:49.395
and write an accessible response to that,

00:24:49.419 --> 00:24:53.426
and the spokesdog would translate that
into a cute dog meme.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:55.244
And so this feedback cycle

00:24:55.268 --> 00:24:59.458
of people very easily accessing,
finding, and asking a scientist,

00:24:59.482 --> 00:25:02.360
and an open API
that allows for voice assistance

00:25:02.384 --> 00:25:06.328
and other third-party developers
to get through it,

00:25:06.352 --> 00:25:08.522
resonates with many US states,

00:25:08.546 --> 00:25:11.457
and I think many of them
are implementing it.

00:25:11.481 --> 00:25:15.352
And before the World Health Assembly,
I think three days before,

00:25:15.376 --> 00:25:19.915
we held a 14 countries
[unclear] lateral meeting,

00:25:19.939 --> 00:25:21.305
kind of, pre-WHA,

00:25:21.329 --> 00:25:24.658
where we shared many small,
like, quick wins like this.

00:25:24.682 --> 00:25:27.864
And I think many jurisdictions
took some of that,

00:25:27.888 --> 00:25:29.595
including the humor versus rumor.

00:25:29.619 --> 00:25:30.785
Many of them said

00:25:30.809 --> 00:25:33.033
that they're going to recruit
comedians now.

00:25:33.473 --> 00:25:35.168
WPR: (Laughs) I love that.

00:25:35.192 --> 00:25:36.568
DB: I hope so.

00:25:36.592 --> 00:25:38.385
WPR: I hope so too.

00:25:38.409 --> 00:25:41.284
And we have one more question,
which is actually a follow-up,

00:25:41.308 --> 00:25:43.942
from Michael Backes,
who asked a question earlier.

00:25:43.966 --> 00:25:47.022
"Does the Ministry plan
to publish their plans in a white paper?"

00:25:47.046 --> 00:25:49.804
Sounds like you're already sharing
your plans with folks,

00:25:49.828 --> 00:25:52.183
but do you have a plan
to put it out on paper?

00:25:52.207 --> 00:25:53.413
AT: Of course.

00:25:53.437 --> 00:25:55.039
Yeah, and multiple white papers.

00:25:55.063 --> 00:25:59.469
So if you go to taiwancanhelp.us,

00:25:59.493 --> 00:26:02.093
that is where most of our strategy is,

00:26:02.117 --> 00:26:05.653
and that website is actually
crowdsourced as well,

00:26:05.677 --> 00:26:08.576
and it shows that more
than five million now, I think,

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.248
medical masks donated
to the humanitarian aid.

00:26:12.272 --> 00:26:13.768
It's also crowdsourced.

00:26:13.792 --> 00:26:17.003
People who have some masks in their homes,

00:26:17.027 --> 00:26:20.026
who did not collect the rationed masks,

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:21.328
they can use an app, say,

00:26:21.352 --> 00:26:24.818
"I want to dedicate this
to international humanitarian aid,"

00:26:24.842 --> 00:26:27.984
and half of them choose
to publish their names,

00:26:28.008 --> 00:26:31.307
so you can also see the names
of people who participated in this.

00:26:31.331 --> 00:26:34.040
And there's also
an "Ask Taiwan Anything" website,

00:26:34.064 --> 00:26:35.561
(Laughs)

00:26:35.585 --> 00:26:38.796
at fightcovid.edu.tw,

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.509
that outlines, in white paper form,
all the response strategies,

00:26:42.533 --> 00:26:44.033
so check those out.

00:26:45.145 --> 00:26:46.307
WPR: Great.

00:26:46.331 --> 00:26:49.682
Well, I will disappear and be back
later with some other questions.

00:26:50.927 --> 00:26:54.156
DB: A blizzard
of white papers, if you will.

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:58.725
I'd like to turn the focus
on you a little bit.

00:26:58.749 --> 00:27:04.333
How does a conservative anarchist
become a digital minister?

00:27:05.466 --> 00:27:08.950
AT: Yeah, by occupying
the parliament, and through that.

00:27:08.974 --> 00:27:09.975
(Laughs)

00:27:09.999 --> 00:27:11.172
More interestingly,

00:27:11.196 --> 00:27:15.220
I would say that I go
working with the government,

00:27:15.244 --> 00:27:17.090
but never for the government.

00:27:17.114 --> 00:27:19.780
And I work with the people,
not for the people.

00:27:19.804 --> 00:27:22.468
I'm like this Lagrange point

00:27:22.492 --> 00:27:25.220
between the people's
movements on one side

00:27:25.244 --> 00:27:27.565
and the government on the other side.

00:27:28.395 --> 00:27:30.165
Sometimes right in the middle,

00:27:30.189 --> 00:27:32.363
trying to do some coach
or translation work.

00:27:32.387 --> 00:27:34.958
Sometimes in a kind of triangle point,

00:27:34.982 --> 00:27:40.299
trying to supply both sides with tools
for prosocial communication.

00:27:40.323 --> 00:27:42.901
But always with this idea

00:27:42.925 --> 00:27:47.022
of getting the shared values
out of different positions,

00:27:47.046 --> 00:27:48.577
out of varied positions.

00:27:48.601 --> 00:27:49.853
Because all too often,

00:27:49.877 --> 00:27:53.323
democracy is built as a showdown
between opposing values.

00:27:53.347 --> 00:27:56.379
But in the pandemic, in the infodemic,

00:27:56.403 --> 00:27:57.815
in climate change,

00:27:57.839 --> 00:27:59.918
in many of those structural issues,

00:27:59.942 --> 00:28:04.201
the virus or carbon dioxide
doesn't sit down and negotiate with you.

00:28:04.225 --> 00:28:07.907
It's a structural issue
that requires common values

00:28:07.931 --> 00:28:09.569
built out of different positions.

00:28:09.593 --> 00:28:15.025
And so that is why my working principle
is radical transparency.

00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:17.228
Every conversation, including this one,

00:28:17.252 --> 00:28:18.425
is on the record,

00:28:18.449 --> 00:28:20.606
including the internal
meetings that I hold.

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:23.995
So you can see all the different
meeting transcripts

00:28:24.019 --> 00:28:26.955
in my YouTube channel,
in the SayIt platform,

00:28:26.979 --> 00:28:29.548
where people can see,
after I became digital minister,

00:28:29.572 --> 00:28:33.055
I held 1,300 meetings
with more than 5,000 speakers,

00:28:33.079 --> 00:28:36.791
with more than 260,000 utterances.

00:28:36.815 --> 00:28:39.626
And every one of them has a URL

00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:43.018
that becomes a social object
that people can have a conversation on.

00:28:43.042 --> 00:28:44.264
And because of that,

00:28:44.288 --> 00:28:49.831
for example, when Uber's David Plouffe
visited me to lobby for Uber,

00:28:49.855 --> 00:28:51.401
because of radical transparency,

00:28:51.425 --> 00:28:53.625
he is very much aware of that,

00:28:53.649 --> 00:28:56.201
and so he made all the arguments
based on public good,

00:28:56.225 --> 00:28:58.434
based on sustainability,
and things like that,

00:28:58.458 --> 00:29:02.395
because he knows that the other sides
would see his positions

00:29:02.419 --> 00:29:04.244
very clearly and transparently.

00:29:04.268 --> 00:29:07.395
So that encourages people
to add on each other's argument,

00:29:07.419 --> 00:29:10.312
instead of attacking each other's person,

00:29:10.336 --> 00:29:12.304
you know, credits and things like that.

00:29:12.328 --> 00:29:14.249
And so I think that, more than anything,

00:29:14.273 --> 00:29:18.568
is the main principle of conserving
the anarchism of the internet,

00:29:18.592 --> 00:29:19.809
which is about, you know,

00:29:19.833 --> 00:29:23.160
nobody can force anyone
to hook to the internet,

00:29:23.184 --> 00:29:25.541
or to adhere to a new internet protocol.

00:29:25.565 --> 00:29:29.116
Everything has to be done
using rough consensus and running code.

00:29:30.649 --> 00:29:33.990
DB: I wish you had more counterparts
all around the world.

00:29:34.014 --> 00:29:36.967
Maybe you wish you had more
counterparts all around the world.

00:29:37.338 --> 00:29:39.700
AT: That's why these ideas
are worth spreading.

00:29:40.076 --> 00:29:41.250
DB: There you go.

00:29:41.274 --> 00:29:47.359
So one of the challenges that might arise
with some of these digital tools

00:29:47.383 --> 00:29:48.723
is access.

00:29:48.747 --> 00:29:51.143
How do you approach that part of it

00:29:51.167 --> 00:29:55.409
for folks maybe who don't have
the best broadband connection

00:29:55.433 --> 00:30:00.590
or the latest mobile phone
or whatever it might be that's required?

00:30:01.569 --> 00:30:03.264
AT: Well, anywhere in Taiwan,

00:30:03.288 --> 00:30:06.778
even on the top of Taiwan,
almost 4,000 meters high,

00:30:06.802 --> 00:30:08.852
the Saviah, or the Jade Mountain,

00:30:08.876 --> 00:30:12.043
you're guaranteed to have
10 megabits per second

00:30:12.067 --> 00:30:14.291
over 4G or fiber or cable,

00:30:14.315 --> 00:30:18.899
with just 16 US dollars
a month, an unlimited plan.

00:30:18.923 --> 00:30:22.201
And actually, on the top
of the mountain, it's faster,

00:30:22.225 --> 00:30:24.209
fewer people use that bandwidth.

00:30:24.233 --> 00:30:26.029
And if you don't, it's my fault.

00:30:26.053 --> 00:30:27.283
It's personally my fault.

00:30:27.307 --> 00:30:29.958
In Taiwan, we have broadband
as a human right.

00:30:29.982 --> 00:30:31.934
And so when we're deploying 5G,

00:30:31.958 --> 00:30:35.125
we're looking at places
where the 4G has the weakest signal,

00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:39.014
and we begin with those places
in our 5G deployment.

00:30:39.038 --> 00:30:42.101
And only by deploying broadband
as a human right

00:30:42.125 --> 00:30:45.068
can we say that this is for everybody.

00:30:45.092 --> 00:30:48.433
That digital democracy
actually strengthens democracy.

00:30:48.457 --> 00:30:51.583
Otherwise, we would be excluding
parts of the society.

00:30:51.607 --> 00:30:53.459
And this also applies to, for example,

00:30:53.483 --> 00:30:55.839
you can go to a local
digital opportunity center

00:30:55.863 --> 00:30:57.643
to rent a tablet that's guaranteed

00:30:57.667 --> 00:30:59.968
to be manufactured
in the past three years,

00:30:59.992 --> 00:31:01.189
and things like that,

00:31:01.213 --> 00:31:03.822
to enable, also,
the different digital access

00:31:03.846 --> 00:31:08.101
by the digital opportunity centers,
universities and schools,

00:31:08.125 --> 00:31:10.378
and public libraries, very important.

00:31:10.402 --> 00:31:13.625
And if people who prefer to talk
in their town hall,

00:31:13.649 --> 00:31:18.185
I personally go to that town hall
with a 360 recorder,

00:31:18.209 --> 00:31:21.471
and livestream that to Taipei
and to other municipalities,

00:31:21.495 --> 00:31:24.101
where the central government's
public servants can join

00:31:24.125 --> 00:31:25.825
in a connected room style,

00:31:25.849 --> 00:31:28.509
but listening to the local people
who set the agenda.

00:31:28.533 --> 00:31:31.145
So people still do face-to-face meetings,

00:31:31.169 --> 00:31:33.733
we're not doing this
to replace face-to-face meetings.

00:31:33.757 --> 00:31:35.522
We're bringing more stakeholders

00:31:35.546 --> 00:31:38.133
from central government
in the local town halls,

00:31:38.157 --> 00:31:40.078
and we're amplifying their voices

00:31:40.102 --> 00:31:43.285
by making sure the transcripts,
the mind maps, and things like that

00:31:43.309 --> 00:31:45.966
are spread through
the internet in real time,

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:48.776
but we don't ever ask the elderly to, say,

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.918
"Oh, you have to learn typing,
otherwise you don't do democracy."

00:31:51.942 --> 00:31:53.109
It's not our style.

00:31:53.133 --> 00:31:54.473
But that requires broadband.

00:31:54.497 --> 00:31:57.960
Because if you don't have broadband,
but only a very limited bandwidth,

00:31:57.984 --> 00:32:00.196
you are forced to use
text-based communication.

00:32:00.521 --> 00:32:01.752
DB: That's right.

00:32:01.776 --> 00:32:03.217
Well, with access, of course,

00:32:03.241 --> 00:32:07.568
comes access for folks
who maybe will misuse the platform.

00:32:07.592 --> 00:32:10.106
You talked a little bit
about disinformation

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:11.868
and using humor to beat rumor.

00:32:11.892 --> 00:32:16.516
But sometimes, disinformation
is more weaponized.

00:32:16.919 --> 00:32:21.461
How do you combat those kinds
of attacks, really?

00:32:22.101 --> 00:32:24.783
AT: Right, so you mean
malinformation, then.

00:32:24.807 --> 00:32:30.868
So essentially, information designed
to cause intentional public harm.

00:32:30.892 --> 00:32:34.177
And that's no laughing matter.

00:32:34.201 --> 00:32:38.712
So for that, we have an idea called
"notice and public notice."

00:32:38.736 --> 00:32:41.117
So this is a Reuters photo,

00:32:41.141 --> 00:32:43.355
and I will read the original caption.

00:32:43.379 --> 00:32:44.633
The original caption says

00:32:44.657 --> 00:32:47.972
"A teenage extradition bill
protester in Hong Kong

00:32:47.996 --> 00:32:52.163
is seen during a march to demand democracy
and political reform in Hong Kong."

00:32:52.187 --> 00:32:54.844
OK, a very neutral title by the Reuters.

00:32:54.868 --> 00:32:58.971
But there was a spreading
of malinformation

00:32:58.995 --> 00:33:00.849
back last November,

00:33:00.873 --> 00:33:02.904
just leading to our presidential election,

00:33:02.928 --> 00:33:05.014
that shows something else entirely.

00:33:05.038 --> 00:33:07.576
This is the same photo -- that says

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.583
"This 13-year-old thug bought new iPhones,

00:33:10.607 --> 00:33:12.654
game consoles and brand-name sports shoes,

00:33:12.678 --> 00:33:15.393
and recruiting his brothers
to murder police

00:33:15.417 --> 00:33:18.620
and collect 200,000 dollars."

00:33:18.644 --> 00:33:22.461
And this, of course, is a weapon
designed to sow discord,

00:33:22.485 --> 00:33:27.895
and to elicit in Taiwan's voters
a kind of distaste for Hong Kong.

00:33:27.919 --> 00:33:31.042
And because they know
that this is the main issue.

00:33:31.066 --> 00:33:33.685
And had we resorted to takedowns,

00:33:33.709 --> 00:33:34.915
that will not work,

00:33:34.939 --> 00:33:37.090
because that would only
evoke more outrage.

00:33:37.114 --> 00:33:38.545
So we didn't do a takedown.

00:33:38.569 --> 00:33:40.610
Instead, we worked with the fact checkers

00:33:40.634 --> 00:33:42.022
and professional journalists

00:33:42.046 --> 00:33:47.225
to attribute this original message
back to the first day that it was posted.

00:33:47.249 --> 00:33:49.680
And it came from Zhongyang Zhengfawei.

00:33:49.704 --> 00:33:56.450
That is the main political and legal unit
of the central party,

00:33:56.474 --> 00:33:58.656
in the Central Communist Party, in CCP.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:04.053
And we know that it's their Weibo account
that first did this new caption.

00:34:04.077 --> 00:34:06.252
So we sent out a public notice

00:34:06.276 --> 00:34:08.633
and with the partners
in social media companies,

00:34:08.657 --> 00:34:10.181
pretty much all of them,

00:34:10.205 --> 00:34:12.939
they just put this very small reminder

00:34:12.963 --> 00:34:16.501
next to each time that this is shared
with the wrong caption,

00:34:16.525 --> 00:34:20.461
that says "This actually came
from the central propaganda unit

00:34:20.485 --> 00:34:21.674
of the CCP.

00:34:21.698 --> 00:34:24.594
Click here to learn more.
To learn about the whole story."

00:34:24.618 --> 00:34:26.968
And that, we found, that has worked,

00:34:26.992 --> 00:34:30.536
because people understand
this is then not a news material.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.115
This is rather an appropriation
of Reuters' news material

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:35.791
and a copyright infringement

00:34:35.815 --> 00:34:38.061
and I think that's part of the [unclear].

00:34:38.085 --> 00:34:40.743
In any case, the point
is that when people understand

00:34:40.767 --> 00:34:42.598
that this is an intentional narrative,

00:34:42.622 --> 00:34:44.550
they won't just randomly share it.

00:34:44.574 --> 00:34:47.137
They may share it,
but with a comment that says

00:34:47.161 --> 00:34:52.539
"This is what the Zhongyang Zhengfawei
is trying to do to our democracy."

00:34:54.182 --> 00:34:58.474
DB: Seems like some
of the global social media companies

00:34:58.498 --> 00:35:02.534
could learn something
from notice and public notice.

00:35:02.558 --> 00:35:04.156
AT: Public notice, that's right.

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:07.039
DB: What advice would you have

00:35:07.063 --> 00:35:12.376
for the Twitters and Facebooks
and LINEs and WhatsApps,

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.734
and you name it, of the world?

00:35:16.203 --> 00:35:17.386
AT: Yeah.

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:20.656
So, just before our election,

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.475
we said to all of them

00:35:22.499 --> 00:35:27.685
that we're not making a law
to kind of punish them.

00:35:27.709 --> 00:35:30.764
However, we're sharing
this very simple fact

00:35:30.788 --> 00:35:32.963
that there is this norm in Taiwan

00:35:32.987 --> 00:35:35.545
that we even have a separate branch
of the government,

00:35:35.569 --> 00:35:36.768
the control branch,

00:35:36.792 --> 00:35:40.360
that published the campaign
donation and expense.

00:35:40.384 --> 00:35:42.534
And it just so occurred to us

00:35:42.558 --> 00:35:45.931
that in the previous election,
the mayoral one,

00:35:45.955 --> 00:35:47.352
there was a lot of candidates

00:35:47.376 --> 00:35:50.053
that did not include
any social media advertisements

00:35:50.077 --> 00:35:52.099
in their expense to the Control Yuan.

00:35:52.123 --> 00:35:56.203
And so essentially, that means
that there is a separate amount

00:35:56.227 --> 00:36:00.847
of political donation and expense
that evades public scrutiny.

00:36:00.871 --> 00:36:03.066
And our Control Yuan
published their numbers

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:04.321
in raw data form,

00:36:04.345 --> 00:36:06.353
that is to say, 
they're not statistics,

00:36:06.367 --> 00:36:09.582
but individual records
of who donated for what cause,

00:36:09.606 --> 00:36:10.757
when, where,

00:36:10.781 --> 00:36:13.243
and investigative journalists
are very happy,

00:36:13.267 --> 00:36:15.839
because they can then make
investigative reports

00:36:15.863 --> 00:36:18.131
about the connections
between the candidates

00:36:18.155 --> 00:36:19.593
and the people who fund them.

00:36:19.617 --> 00:36:21.934
But they cannot work
with the same material

00:36:21.958 --> 00:36:23.959
from the global social media companies.

00:36:23.983 --> 00:36:26.359
So I said, "Look, this is very simple.

00:36:26.383 --> 00:36:27.773
This is the social norm here,

00:36:27.797 --> 00:36:29.978
I don't really care
about other jurisdictions.

00:36:30.002 --> 00:36:33.816
You either adhere to the social norm
that is set by the Control Yuan

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.506
and the investigative journalists,

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:37.895
or maybe you will face social sanctions.

00:36:37.919 --> 00:36:40.156
And this is not the government mandate,

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:44.061
but it's the people fed up with,
you know, black box,

00:36:44.085 --> 00:36:47.910
and that's part of the Sunflower
Occupy's demands, also.

00:36:47.934 --> 00:36:51.871
And so Facebook actually published
in the Ad Library,

00:36:51.895 --> 00:36:57.014
I think at that time,
one of the fastest response strategies,

00:36:57.038 --> 00:37:03.058
where everybody who has
basically any dark pattern advertisement

00:37:03.082 --> 00:37:04.931
will get revealed very quickly,

00:37:04.955 --> 00:37:08.399
and investigative journalists
work with the local civic technologists

00:37:08.423 --> 00:37:13.227
to make sure that if anybody dare to use
social media in such a divisive way,

00:37:13.251 --> 00:37:17.307
within an hour, there will be
a report out condemning that.

00:37:17.331 --> 00:37:21.474
So nobody tried that during
the previous presidential election season.

00:37:21.498 --> 00:37:23.458
DB: So change is possible.

00:37:24.196 --> 00:37:25.346
AT: Mhm.

00:37:27.942 --> 00:37:30.911
WPR: Hey there, we have
some more questions from the community.

00:37:30.935 --> 00:37:33.188
There is an anonymous one

00:37:33.212 --> 00:37:37.704
that says, "I believe Taiwan
is outside WHO entirely

00:37:37.728 --> 00:37:40.786
and has a 130-part preparation program --

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:42.572
developed entirely on its own --

00:37:42.596 --> 00:37:45.005
to what extent does it credit
its preparation

00:37:45.029 --> 00:37:46.896
to building its own system?"

00:37:48.168 --> 00:37:51.871
AT: Well, a little bit, I guess.

00:37:51.895 --> 00:37:54.905
We tried to warn the WHO,

00:37:54.929 --> 00:37:56.127
but at that point --

00:37:56.151 --> 00:37:59.950
we are not totally outside,
we have limited scientific access.

00:37:59.974 --> 00:38:02.529
But we do not have any ministerial access.

00:38:02.553 --> 00:38:04.180
And this is very different, right?

00:38:04.204 --> 00:38:06.768
If you only have limited
scientific access,

00:38:06.792 --> 00:38:12.680
unless the other side's top epidemiologist
happens to be the vice president,

00:38:12.704 --> 00:38:14.720
like in Taiwan's case,

00:38:14.744 --> 00:38:18.514
they don't always do
the storytelling well enough

00:38:18.538 --> 00:38:22.570
to translate that into political action
as our vice president did, right?

00:38:22.594 --> 00:38:25.124
So the lack of ministerial
access, I think,

00:38:25.148 --> 00:38:28.020
is to the detriment
of the global community,

00:38:28.044 --> 00:38:31.331
because otherwise,
people could have responded as we did

00:38:31.355 --> 00:38:32.791
in the first day of January,

00:38:32.815 --> 00:38:36.012
instead of having to wait for weeks

00:38:36.036 --> 00:38:39.702
before the WHO declared
that this is something,

00:38:39.726 --> 00:38:42.156
that there's definitely
human to human transmission,

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.845
that you should inspect people
coming in from Wuhan,

00:38:44.869 --> 00:38:46.383
which they eventually did,

00:38:46.407 --> 00:38:49.624
but that's already two weeks
or three weeks after what we did.

00:38:52.247 --> 00:38:53.577
WPR: Makes a lot of sense.

00:38:53.601 --> 00:38:57.014
DB: More scientists
and technologists in politics.

00:38:57.038 --> 00:38:58.888
That sounds like that's the answer.

00:38:59.228 --> 00:39:00.378
AT: Yeah.

00:39:02.633 --> 00:39:06.212
WPR: And then we have another
question here from Kamal Srinivasan

00:39:06.236 --> 00:39:07.768
about your reopening strategy.

00:39:07.792 --> 00:39:12.368
"How are you enabling restaurants
and retailers to open safely in Taiwan?"

00:39:12.974 --> 00:39:15.363
AT: Oh, they never closed, so ... (Laughs)

00:39:15.387 --> 00:39:16.862
WPR: Oh!

00:39:16.886 --> 00:39:18.236
AT: Yeah, they never closed,

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:21.389
there was no lockdown,
there was no closure.

00:39:21.413 --> 00:39:24.889
We just said a very simple thing
in the CECC press conference,

00:39:24.913 --> 00:39:27.135
that there's going to be
physical distancing.

00:39:27.159 --> 00:39:29.215
You maintain one and a half meters indoors

00:39:29.239 --> 00:39:30.389
or wear a mask.

00:39:30.413 --> 00:39:31.594
And that's it.

00:39:31.618 --> 00:39:36.275
And so there are some restaurants
that put up, I guess, red curtains,

00:39:36.299 --> 00:39:40.627
some put very cute teddy bears
and so on, on the chairs,

00:39:40.651 --> 00:39:42.982
to make sure that people spread evenly,

00:39:43.006 --> 00:39:49.240
some installed see-through
glass or plastic walls

00:39:49.264 --> 00:39:50.662
between the seats.

00:39:50.686 --> 00:39:53.899
There's various social
innovations happening around.

00:39:53.923 --> 00:39:58.515
And I think the only shops
that got closed for a while,

00:39:58.539 --> 00:40:03.484
because they could not innovate
quick enough to respond to these rules,

00:40:03.508 --> 00:40:06.277
was the intimate escort bars.

00:40:06.301 --> 00:40:09.757
But eventually,
even they invented new ways,

00:40:09.781 --> 00:40:14.384
by handing out these caps
that are plastic shielding,

00:40:14.408 --> 00:40:17.749
but still leaves room
for drinking behind it.

00:40:17.773 --> 00:40:20.461
And so they opened
with that social innovation.

00:40:22.479 --> 00:40:24.162
DB: That's amazing.

00:40:24.186 --> 00:40:28.692
WPR: It is, yeah, it's a lot to learn
from your strategies there.

00:40:28.716 --> 00:40:32.791
Thank you, I'll be back towards the end
with some final questions.

00:40:34.002 --> 00:40:37.867
DB: I'm very happy to hear
that the restaurants were not closed down,

00:40:37.891 --> 00:40:42.275
because I think Taipei
has some of the best food in the world

00:40:42.299 --> 00:40:45.329
of any city that I've visited,

00:40:45.353 --> 00:40:48.517
so, you know, kudos to you for that.

00:40:50.252 --> 00:40:56.791
So the big concern when it comes
to using digital tools for COVID

00:40:56.815 --> 00:40:59.153
or using digital tools for democracy

00:40:59.177 --> 00:41:01.651
is always privacy.

00:41:01.675 --> 00:41:04.985
You've talked about that a little bit,

00:41:05.009 --> 00:41:08.543
but I'm sure the citizens of Taiwan

00:41:08.567 --> 00:41:11.295
are perhaps equally concerned
about their privacy,

00:41:11.319 --> 00:41:14.483
especially given the geopolitical context.

00:41:14.507 --> 00:41:15.663
AT: Definitely.

00:41:15.687 --> 00:41:17.749
DB: So how do you cope with those demands?

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:25.060
AT: Yeah, we design
with not only defensive strategy,

00:41:25.084 --> 00:41:27.498
like minimization of data collection,

00:41:27.522 --> 00:41:29.977
but also proactive measures,

00:41:30.001 --> 00:41:32.522
such as privacy-enhancing technologies.

00:41:32.546 --> 00:41:35.740
One of the top teams
that emerged out of our cohack,

00:41:35.764 --> 00:41:39.352
the TW response from the Polis,

00:41:39.376 --> 00:41:42.264
how to make contact tracing easier,

00:41:42.288 --> 00:41:44.328
focused not on the contact tracers,

00:41:44.352 --> 00:41:47.213
not on the medical officers,
but on the person.

00:41:47.237 --> 00:41:49.530
So they basically said,
"OK, you have a phone,

00:41:49.554 --> 00:41:51.620
you can record your temperatures,

00:41:51.644 --> 00:41:54.847
you can record your whereabouts
and things like that,

00:41:54.871 --> 00:41:56.974
but that is strictly in your phone.

00:41:56.998 --> 00:41:58.529
It doesn't even use Bluetooth.

00:41:58.553 --> 00:41:59.887
So there's no transmission.

00:42:00.229 --> 00:42:01.776
Technology uses open-source,

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.331
you can check it,
you can use it in airplane mode.

00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:06.903
And when the contact tracer
eventually tells you

00:42:06.927 --> 00:42:08.974
that you are part of a high-risk group,

00:42:08.998 --> 00:42:11.323
and they really want your contact history,

00:42:11.347 --> 00:42:14.553
this tool can then generate
a single-use URL

00:42:14.577 --> 00:42:18.358
that only contains
the precise information,

00:42:18.382 --> 00:42:19.564
anonymized,

00:42:19.588 --> 00:42:21.228
that the contact tracers want.

00:42:21.252 --> 00:42:24.522
But it will not,
like in a traditional interview,

00:42:24.546 --> 00:42:26.313
let you ask --

00:42:26.337 --> 00:42:29.799
they ask a question, they only want
to know your whereabouts,

00:42:29.823 --> 00:42:31.665
but you answer with such accuracy

00:42:31.689 --> 00:42:34.609
that you end up compromising
other people's privacy.

00:42:34.633 --> 00:42:37.225
So basically, this is about designing

00:42:37.249 --> 00:42:40.600
with an aim to enhance
other people's privacy,

00:42:40.624 --> 00:42:43.617
because personal data
is never truly personal.

00:42:43.641 --> 00:42:46.403
It's always social,
it's always intersectional.

00:42:46.427 --> 00:42:48.907
If I take a selfie at a party,

00:42:48.931 --> 00:42:52.616
I inadvertently also take
pretty much everybody else's

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:56.283
who are in the picture, the surroundings,
the ambiance, and so on,

00:42:56.307 --> 00:42:59.634
and if I upload it to a cloud service,

00:42:59.658 --> 00:43:02.691
then I actually decimate
the bargaining power,

00:43:02.715 --> 00:43:05.304
the negotiation power
of everybody around me,

00:43:05.328 --> 00:43:08.174
because then their data
is part of the cloud,

00:43:08.198 --> 00:43:10.315
and the cloud doesn't have to
compensate them

00:43:10.339 --> 00:43:11.928
or get their agreement for it.

00:43:11.952 --> 00:43:14.204
And so only by designing the tools

00:43:14.228 --> 00:43:17.617
with privacy enhancing
as a positive value,

00:43:17.641 --> 00:43:20.323
and not enhancing only
the person's own privacy,

00:43:20.347 --> 00:43:22.392
just like a medical mask, it protects you,

00:43:22.416 --> 00:43:24.498
but mostly it also protects others, right?

00:43:24.522 --> 00:43:27.823
So if we design tools using that idea,

00:43:27.847 --> 00:43:31.291
and always open-source
and with an open API,

00:43:31.315 --> 00:43:33.029
then we're in a much better shape

00:43:33.053 --> 00:43:37.339
than in centralized or so-called
cloud-based services.

00:43:39.656 --> 00:43:42.370
DB: Well, you're clearly
living in the future,

00:43:42.394 --> 00:43:45.371
and I guess that's quite literal,

00:43:45.395 --> 00:43:47.521
in the sense of,
it's tomorrow morning there.

00:43:47.545 --> 00:43:48.704
AT: Twelve hours.

00:43:48.728 --> 00:43:49.878
DB: Yes.

00:43:50.657 --> 00:43:53.585
Tell me, what do you see in the future?

00:43:53.609 --> 00:43:55.353
What comes next?

00:43:56.926 --> 00:44:01.001
AT: Yes, so I see the coronavirus
as a great amplifier.

00:44:01.025 --> 00:44:05.390
If you start with
an authoritarian society,

00:44:05.414 --> 00:44:07.974
the coronavirus,
with all its lockdowns and so on,

00:44:07.998 --> 00:44:12.807
has the potential of making it
even a more totalitarian society.

00:44:12.831 --> 00:44:15.022
If people place their trust, however,

00:44:15.046 --> 00:44:16.236
on the social sector,

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:19.212
on the ingenuity of social innovators,

00:44:19.236 --> 00:44:21.164
then the pandemic, as in Taiwan,

00:44:21.188 --> 00:44:23.400
actually strengthens our democracy,

00:44:23.424 --> 00:44:26.728
so that people feel, truly,
that everybody can think of something

00:44:26.752 --> 00:44:30.294
that improves the welfare
of not just Taiwan,

00:44:30.318 --> 00:44:33.322
but pretty much everybody
else in the world.

00:44:33.346 --> 00:44:34.791
And so, my point here

00:44:34.815 --> 00:44:39.577
is that the great amplifier
comes if no matter you want it or not,

00:44:39.601 --> 00:44:44.210
but the society, what they can do,
is do what Taiwan did after SARS.

00:44:44.234 --> 00:44:46.702
In 2003, when SARS came,

00:44:46.726 --> 00:44:48.917
we had to shut down an entire hospital,

00:44:48.941 --> 00:44:52.845
barricading it with no definite
termination date.

00:44:52.869 --> 00:44:54.323
It was very traumatic,

00:44:54.347 --> 00:44:57.879
everybody above the age of 30
remembers how traumatic it was.

00:44:57.903 --> 00:44:59.102
The municipalities

00:44:59.126 --> 00:45:02.020
and the central government
were saying very different things,

00:45:02.044 --> 00:45:03.871
and that is why after SARS,

00:45:03.895 --> 00:45:06.998
the constitutional courts
charged the legislature

00:45:07.022 --> 00:45:09.450
to set up the system as you see today,

00:45:09.474 --> 00:45:10.831
and also that is why,

00:45:10.855 --> 00:45:14.117
when people responding
to that crisis back in 2003

00:45:14.141 --> 00:45:18.347
built this very robust response system
that there's early drills.

00:45:18.371 --> 00:45:20.569
So just as the Sunflower Occupy,

00:45:20.593 --> 00:45:25.418
because of the crisis in trust
let us build new tools

00:45:25.442 --> 00:45:27.276
that put trust first,

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:31.998
I think the coronavirus is the chance
for everybody who have survived

00:45:32.022 --> 00:45:33.183
through the first wave

00:45:33.207 --> 00:45:38.529
to settle on a new set of norms
that will reinforce your founding values,

00:45:38.553 --> 00:45:42.596
instead of taking on alien values
in the name of survival.

00:45:44.704 --> 00:45:46.812
DB: Yeah, let's hope so,

00:45:46.836 --> 00:45:52.348
and let's hope the rest of the world
is as prepared as Taiwan

00:45:52.372 --> 00:45:54.609
the next time around.

00:45:54.633 --> 00:45:58.109
When it comes to digital
democracy, though,

00:45:58.133 --> 00:45:59.617
and digital citizenship,

00:45:59.641 --> 00:46:01.649
where do you see that going,

00:46:01.673 --> 00:46:04.289
both in Taiwan and maybe
in the rest of the world?

00:46:05.108 --> 00:46:08.139
AT: Well, I have my job description here,

00:46:08.163 --> 00:46:09.474
which I will read to you.

00:46:09.498 --> 00:46:12.875
It's literally my job description
and the answer to that question.

00:46:12.899 --> 00:46:14.049
And so, here goes.

00:46:14.474 --> 00:46:16.982
When we see the internet of things,

00:46:17.006 --> 00:46:19.206
let's make it the internet of beings.

00:46:19.657 --> 00:46:21.847
When we see virtual reality,

00:46:21.871 --> 00:46:24.093
let's make it a shared reality.

00:46:24.728 --> 00:46:26.831
When we see machine learning,

00:46:26.855 --> 00:46:29.322
let's make it collaborative learning.

00:46:29.758 --> 00:46:32.432
When we see user experience,

00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:35.019
let's make it about human experience.

00:46:35.361 --> 00:46:38.369
And whenever we hear
the singularity is near,

00:46:38.393 --> 00:46:40.133
let us always remember

00:46:40.157 --> 00:46:42.228
the plurality is here.

00:46:42.942 --> 00:46:44.542
Thank you for listening.

00:46:45.379 --> 00:46:46.680
DB: Wow.

00:46:46.704 --> 00:46:48.729
I have to give that a little clap,

00:46:48.753 --> 00:46:50.020
that was beautiful.

00:46:50.625 --> 00:46:51.775
(Laughs)

00:46:52.243 --> 00:46:53.625
Quite a job description too.

00:46:53.649 --> 00:46:55.692
So, conservative anarchist,

00:46:55.716 --> 00:46:59.032
digital minister,
and with that job description --

00:46:59.056 --> 00:47:00.289
that's pretty impressive.

00:47:00.313 --> 00:47:01.913
AT: A poetician, yes.

00:47:02.279 --> 00:47:04.223
DB: (Laughs)

00:47:04.858 --> 00:47:09.527
So I struggle to imagine

00:47:09.551 --> 00:47:13.011
an adoption of these techniques in the US,

00:47:13.035 --> 00:47:16.874
and that may be my pessimism weighing in.

00:47:16.898 --> 00:47:21.815
But what words of hope do you have
for the US, as we cope with COVID?

00:47:23.701 --> 00:47:27.462
AT: Well, as I mentioned,
during SARS in Taiwan,

00:47:27.486 --> 00:47:32.099
nobody imagined we could have
CECC and a cute spokesdog.

00:47:32.123 --> 00:47:34.896
Before the Sunflower movement,
during a large protest,

00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:39.260
there was, I think, half a million
people on the street, and many more.

00:47:39.284 --> 00:47:43.406
Nobody thought that we could have
a collective intelligence system

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:46.200
that puts open government data

00:47:46.224 --> 00:47:48.994
as a way to rebuild citizen participation.

00:47:49.018 --> 00:47:50.993
And so, never lose hope.

00:47:51.017 --> 00:47:56.631
As my favorite singer, Leonard Cohen --
a poet, also -- is fond of saying,

00:47:56.655 --> 00:47:58.345
"Ring the bells that still can ring

00:47:58.369 --> 00:48:01.004
and forget any perfect offering.

00:48:01.028 --> 00:48:05.353
There is a crack in everything
and that is how the light gets in."

00:48:07.149 --> 00:48:08.299
WPR: Wow.

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:10.527
That's so beautiful,

00:48:10.551 --> 00:48:14.447
and it feels like such a great message
to, sort of, leave the audience with,

00:48:14.471 --> 00:48:15.767
and sharing the sentiment

00:48:15.791 --> 00:48:19.475
that everyone seems to be so grateful
for what you've shared, Audrey,

00:48:19.499 --> 00:48:25.355
and all the great information
and insight into Taiwan's strategies.

00:48:26.502 --> 00:48:27.653
AT: Thank you.

00:48:27.677 --> 00:48:28.827
WPR: And David --

00:48:29.661 --> 00:48:32.312
DB: I was just going to say,
thank you so much for that,

00:48:32.336 --> 00:48:34.462
thank you for that beautiful
job description,

00:48:34.486 --> 00:48:38.746
and for all the wisdom you shared
in rapid-fire fashion.

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:41.922
I think it wasn't just one idea
that you shared,

00:48:41.946 --> 00:48:44.926
but maybe, I don't know, 20, 30, 40?

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:46.750
I lost count at some point.

00:48:47.855 --> 00:48:49.958
AT: Well, it's called
Ideas Worth Spreading,

00:48:49.982 --> 00:48:51.259
it's a plural form.

00:48:51.283 --> 00:48:53.000
(Laughter)

00:48:53.363 --> 00:48:54.514
DB: Very true.

00:48:54.538 --> 00:48:57.230
Well, thank you so much for joining us.

00:48:57.254 --> 00:48:58.405
WPR: Thank you, Audrey.

00:48:58.429 --> 00:49:00.355
DB: And I wish you luck with everything.

00:49:00.857 --> 00:49:03.225
AT: Thank you, and have a good local time.

00:49:03.249 --> 00:49:04.399
Stay safe.
