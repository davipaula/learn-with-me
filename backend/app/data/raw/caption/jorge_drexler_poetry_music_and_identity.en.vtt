00:00:13.198 --> 00:00:15.395
I'm going to tell you the story of a song.

00:00:15.864 --> 00:00:20.258
I was in Madrid one night in 2002

00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:22.585
with my teacher and friend Joaquín Sabina,

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.686
when he said he had something to give me.

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:26.941
He said,

00:00:26.965 --> 00:00:30.322
"Jorge, I have some lines
that you need to put into a song.

00:00:30.346 --> 00:00:32.005
Take these down, take these down."

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.033
I looked on the table but all I found
was a circular coaster,

00:00:35.057 --> 00:00:37.409
on which I wrote the lines
my teacher dictated.

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:39.906
They were four lines that went like this:

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.267
"I am a Jewish Moor
living among Christians

00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:46.979
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are."

00:00:48.357 --> 00:00:51.378
Those lines really made
an impression on me.

00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:54.386
I said, "What beautiful lyrics,
Joaquín. Did you write them?"

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.888
He said no, they were by another composer
named Chicho Sánchez Ferlosio,

00:00:59.912 --> 00:01:02.743
who was less known than Joaquín,
but also a great poet.

00:01:03.732 --> 00:01:05.292
These lines came to me at a time

00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:08.122
where I had been wanting
to express something for a while,

00:01:08.146 --> 00:01:09.786
but didn't quite know how.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.696
I was getting up to leave
and go home to write,

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.210
when Joaquín stopped me
and said, "Hang on, hang on,"

00:01:15.234 --> 00:01:17.144
and presented me with this challenge:

00:01:17.982 --> 00:01:20.977
"Write the stanzas for this song

00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:22.216
in Décimas."

00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:25.577
Now, at this point in my life,

00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:28.349
I still wasn't completely
sure what Décimas were,

00:01:29.397 --> 00:01:33.659
but I was too embarrassed
to tell my teacher I didn't know.

00:01:33.683 --> 00:01:37.368
So I put on my best
"Yeah, I totally understand" face,

00:01:37.392 --> 00:01:40.131
and went home to look up
what Décimas were.

00:01:40.155 --> 00:01:43.635
I learned that a Décima is a type of verse

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.074
that only exists in Spanish,

00:01:45.098 --> 00:01:46.362
and that it has 10 lines.

00:01:46.386 --> 00:01:48.387
It's very, very complex --

00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:51.581
perhaps the most complex style of stanza
that we have in Spanish.

00:01:51.605 --> 00:01:54.064
It also has a very concrete
date of origin,

00:01:54.088 --> 00:01:56.422
which is very rare for a style of stanza.

00:01:56.446 --> 00:02:00.101
The Décima was invented in Spain in 1591,

00:02:01.693 --> 00:02:06.016
by a guy named Vicente Espinel,
a musician and poet from Málaga.

00:02:07.448 --> 00:02:10.067
And listen to this coincidence:
he was the same guy

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:12.614
who added the sixth string

00:02:12.638 --> 00:02:14.941
to what would later be called
the Spanish guitar.

00:02:14.965 --> 00:02:16.331
This string right here --

00:02:16.355 --> 00:02:17.648
it's called the "bordona."

00:02:18.604 --> 00:02:22.048
From Spain, the Décima, with its 10 lines,

00:02:22.072 --> 00:02:26.879
crosses over to America,
just like the Spanish guitar,

00:02:26.903 --> 00:02:28.433
but in contrast to the Décima,

00:02:28.457 --> 00:02:30.906
the Spanish guitar continues to live today

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.619
on both sides of the Atlantic.

00:02:32.643 --> 00:02:35.735
But the Décima, in Spain, its birthplace,

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:37.292
disappeared; it died out.

00:02:38.213 --> 00:02:40.532
It died out about 200 years ago,

00:02:40.556 --> 00:02:45.220
and yet in Latin America,
from Mexico to Chile,

00:02:45.244 --> 00:02:48.464
all our countries maintain
some form of the Décima

00:02:49.222 --> 00:02:50.755
in our popular traditions.

00:02:52.331 --> 00:02:54.645
In each place, they've given it
a different name,

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:56.200
and set it to different music.

00:02:56.756 --> 00:03:01.080
It has a lot of different names --
more than 20 in total on the continent.

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:04.809
In Mexico, for example,
it's called the "Son Jarocho,"

00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:06.638
"Canto de mejorana" in Panama;

00:03:06.662 --> 00:03:08.216
"Galerón" in Venezuela;

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.140
"Payada" in Uruguay and Argentina;

00:03:11.297 --> 00:03:12.711
"Repentismo" in Cuba.

00:03:12.735 --> 00:03:15.017
In Peru, they call it the Peruvian Décima,

00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:18.140
because the Décima becomes
so integrated into our traditions,

00:03:18.164 --> 00:03:21.697
that if someone asks, people
from each place are completely convinced

00:03:21.721 --> 00:03:24.476
that the Décima was invented
in their country.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.849
(Laughter)

00:03:25.873 --> 00:03:28.024
It's also got a really surprising feature,

00:03:28.048 --> 00:03:31.317
which is that despite the fact
that it developed independently

00:03:31.341 --> 00:03:33.378
in each of the different countries,

00:03:33.402 --> 00:03:37.780
it maintains even today,
400 years after its creation,

00:03:37.804 --> 00:03:44.249
exactly the same rhyme,
syllable and line structure --

00:03:44.996 --> 00:03:48.703
the same structure Vicente Espinel gave it
during the Spanish Baroque period.

00:03:48.727 --> 00:03:49.908
Here's the structure --

00:03:49.932 --> 00:03:52.958
I'll give you the basic idea
and then later you can look online

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:55.102
and learn more about it.

00:03:55.126 --> 00:03:58.191
The Décima is ten lines long;
each line has eight syllables.

00:03:59.961 --> 00:04:02.436
The first line rhymes
with the fourth and the fifth;

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.008
the second line, with the third;

00:04:04.032 --> 00:04:06.839
the sixth line,
with the seventh and the tenth;

00:04:06.863 --> 00:04:09.297
and the eighth line rhymes with the ninth.

00:04:09.321 --> 00:04:12.108
It's a bit complicated, to be honest.

00:04:12.132 --> 00:04:15.151
And me -- imagine me,
trying to write in Décimas.

00:04:16.207 --> 00:04:18.150
But it's not as complicated as it seems.

00:04:19.063 --> 00:04:22.224
Plus, it's amazing that it's survived
with the same structure

00:04:22.248 --> 00:04:23.839
for more than four centuries.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.332
It's not that complicated, because it has
an impressive musicality to it,

00:04:28.356 --> 00:04:29.762
a type of musicality

00:04:30.796 --> 00:04:33.602
that's very hard to describe technically.

00:04:34.096 --> 00:04:35.689
I prefer that you listen to it.

00:04:35.713 --> 00:04:38.539
So I'm going to recite a Décima,

00:04:39.282 --> 00:04:43.124
one of the Décimas
that I wrote for this song.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.096
I'm going to ask that you concentrate
just on the musicality of the rhymes.

00:04:50.112 --> 00:04:52.029
For those of you with headphones on --

00:04:52.053 --> 00:04:56.816
I see that some of you are listening
to the translation --

00:04:57.692 --> 00:04:59.757
please take them off for a minute.

00:04:59.781 --> 00:05:02.363
(English) Take your headphones off,
it you have them.

00:05:03.408 --> 00:05:09.425
(English) Forget about the meaning
of the words for a few seconds,

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.420
(English) and then you'll put them back.

00:05:11.444 --> 00:05:13.250
(English) Forget about the structure.

00:05:13.274 --> 00:05:15.062
(Spanish) Forget about the structure.

00:05:15.086 --> 00:05:20.328
(English) And just ... it's all about
the choreography of sound of the Décima.

00:05:20.352 --> 00:05:22.609
(Spanish) A choreography of sound.

00:05:24.752 --> 00:05:28.158
(Sings in Spanish) "There is not one death
that does not cause me pain,

00:05:28.188 --> 00:05:29.199
there are no winners,

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:32.167
here’s nothing but suffering
and another life blown away.

00:05:32.191 --> 00:05:35.568
War is a terrible school
no matter what the disguise,

00:05:35.592 --> 00:05:38.490
forgive me for not enlisting
under any flag,

00:05:38.514 --> 00:05:43.391
any daydream is worth more
than a sad piece of cloth."

00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:47.616
That's a Décima.

00:05:48.151 --> 00:05:50.458
(English) You can put
your headphones back on.

00:05:50.482 --> 00:05:51.560
(Applause)

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:52.737
(English) Thank you.

00:05:52.761 --> 00:05:55.863
(Applause)

00:05:57.356 --> 00:06:00.655
I also applaud Vicente Espinel,
because here it is 426 years later,

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:02.406
and the Décima lives on everywhere

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.628
in its original state.

00:06:03.652 --> 00:06:06.252
I wrote three like that one;
you just heard the second.

00:06:06.276 --> 00:06:08.950
I wrote the first one having only
recently learned how,

00:06:08.974 --> 00:06:11.079
and it has some errors in terms of meter,

00:06:11.103 --> 00:06:13.268
so it's not presentable
in its current state.

00:06:13.292 --> 00:06:15.911
But the one I sang was good, more or less.

00:06:15.935 --> 00:06:18.863
So: What was it about?

00:06:19.472 --> 00:06:21.690
What was the meaning behind those lines?

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:25.237
I had just returned from doing
a concert in Israel,

00:06:26.173 --> 00:06:29.890
and I was very emotional over a problem
that hits really close to home,

00:06:29.914 --> 00:06:31.981
which is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

00:06:32.005 --> 00:06:34.128
I'll explain: my dad's family is Jewish,

00:06:34.152 --> 00:06:37.025
and my mom's family
are non-practicing Christians.

00:06:37.049 --> 00:06:41.608
I was raised in a home
where the two traditions lived together

00:06:41.632 --> 00:06:43.344
more or less in harmony.

00:06:44.788 --> 00:06:48.575
It wasn't unusual to see my Jewish grandpa
dressed as Santa Claus, for example,

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:51.837
or to see my non-Jewish grandpa
at the synagogue wearing his kippah,

00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:55.276
at family celebrations, wearing the same
expression that I probably had

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.663
when Sabina told me --

00:06:56.687 --> 00:06:57.727
(Laughter)

00:06:57.751 --> 00:06:59.813
that he had some Décima lines for me.

00:07:02.166 --> 00:07:05.797
For someone raised
in that kind of environment,

00:07:05.821 --> 00:07:11.032
it's especially painful to see
the difficulty the opposing parties have

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:14.243
in putting themselves in the other
side's shoes even for a moment.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.817
So that's what I wrote about.

00:07:16.403 --> 00:07:17.653
I already had the lyrics,

00:07:17.677 --> 00:07:20.126
I had the form -- the Décima --
and the content.

00:07:21.127 --> 00:07:22.986
I needed to write the music.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.570
I'll give you some context.

00:07:25.594 --> 00:07:29.413
I had only recently moved from Uruguay,
where I'm from, to Spain.

00:07:30.293 --> 00:07:33.115
And I was feeling very raw with nostalgia,

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:35.919
like many of you here,
who are away from home.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.540
And I wanted my song
to be very, very Uruguayan,

00:07:40.564 --> 00:07:43.353
the most Uruguayan type of song
there is -- the milonga.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:48.453
So now, I had been studying the Décima,
and after finding out

00:07:49.823 --> 00:07:52.383
that everyone tried to claim
the Décima as their own,

00:07:52.407 --> 00:07:54.275
that it was invented in their country,

00:07:54.299 --> 00:07:55.453
it made me wonder:

00:07:55.477 --> 00:07:58.092
What does it mean when we say
the milonga is Uruguayan?

00:07:58.116 --> 00:08:03.733
The milonga has a rhythmic pattern
that we musicians call 3-3-2.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.619
(Counts out the beats) One two three,
one two three, one two.

00:08:11.918 --> 00:08:14.419
And it has a characteristic emphasis.

00:08:14.443 --> 00:08:17.315
(Sings)

00:08:22.924 --> 00:08:25.655
But this characteristic rhythm pattern

00:08:25.679 --> 00:08:27.110
comes from Africa.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.690
In the ninth century you could find it
in the brothels of Persia,

00:08:30.714 --> 00:08:31.873
and in the thirteenth,

00:08:33.331 --> 00:08:35.993
in Spain, from where,
five centuries later,

00:08:36.017 --> 00:08:38.668
it would cross over to America
with the African slaves.

00:08:39.877 --> 00:08:44.254
Meanwhile, in the Balkans,
it encounters the Roma scale --

00:08:44.278 --> 00:08:47.137
(Sings)

00:08:51.569 --> 00:08:54.327
which in part, gives birth
to klezmer music,

00:08:55.082 --> 00:08:59.202
which Ukrainian Jewish immigrants
bring to Brooklyn, New York.

00:08:59.848 --> 00:09:01.660
They sing it in their banquet halls.

00:09:02.711 --> 00:09:08.332
(Sings "Hava Nagila")

00:09:09.485 --> 00:09:12.411
And their neighbor,
an Argentine kid of Italian origin

00:09:12.435 --> 00:09:14.701
named Astor Piazzolla,

00:09:14.725 --> 00:09:16.743
hears it,

00:09:16.767 --> 00:09:18.294
assimilates it

00:09:18.318 --> 00:09:21.319
and transforms the tango
of the second half of the 20th century

00:09:21.343 --> 00:09:22.496
with his ...

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.623
(Counts out the beats) One two three,
one two three, one two.

00:09:26.025 --> 00:09:28.948
(Sings "Adios Nonino")

00:09:34.114 --> 00:09:38.805
He also played it on his bandoneon,
a 19th-century German instrument

00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:42.956
created for churches
that couldn't afford to buy organs,

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.347
and that ends up, incredibly,
in Río de la Plata,

00:09:45.371 --> 00:09:49.458
forming the very essence
of the tango and the milonga,

00:09:49.482 --> 00:09:53.448
in the very same way another instrument
just as important as the bandoneon did:

00:09:54.525 --> 00:09:56.076
the Spanish guitar.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.212
(Applause)

00:10:08.457 --> 00:10:11.281
To which, by the way,
Vicente Espinel, in the 16th century,

00:10:11.305 --> 00:10:12.557
added a sixth string.

00:10:12.581 --> 00:10:15.451
It's amazing how all these things
are coming full circle.

00:10:15.475 --> 00:10:18.355
What have I learned in these 15 years
since the song was born

00:10:18.379 --> 00:10:21.715
from going all over the world
with four lines written on a coaster

00:10:21.739 --> 00:10:22.889
from a bar in Madrid?

00:10:24.553 --> 00:10:25.844
That Décimas,

00:10:26.691 --> 00:10:27.931
the milonga,

00:10:27.955 --> 00:10:29.521
songs, people --

00:10:30.461 --> 00:10:32.414
the closer you get to them,

00:10:32.438 --> 00:10:34.938
the more complex their identity becomes,

00:10:35.605 --> 00:10:37.660
and the more nuances and details appear.

00:10:38.818 --> 00:10:41.967
I learned that identity
is infinitely dense,

00:10:41.991 --> 00:10:44.543
like an infinite series of real numbers,

00:10:44.567 --> 00:10:46.315
and that even if you get very close

00:10:46.339 --> 00:10:47.497
and zoom in,

00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:48.672
it never ends.

00:10:50.467 --> 00:10:55.040
Before I sing you a song and say goodbye,

00:10:55.064 --> 00:10:57.338
allow me to tell you one last story.

00:10:57.362 --> 00:11:01.962
Not long ago, we were in Mexico
after a concert.

00:11:02.902 --> 00:11:05.163
And since the concert promoters know me,

00:11:05.187 --> 00:11:09.111
they knew I was a Décima freak
and that everywhere I go I ask about it,

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:10.873
insisting on hearing Décima artists.

00:11:10.897 --> 00:11:15.587
So they organized a son jarocho show
for me at their house.

00:11:16.096 --> 00:11:20.711
If you recall, the son jarocho
is one of the styles of music

00:11:20.735 --> 00:11:22.827
that uses Décimas in its verses.

00:11:24.552 --> 00:11:28.364
When these amazing musicians
finished playing

00:11:28.388 --> 00:11:31.266
what is for me, something amazing,
which is the son jarocho,

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:32.955
they finished playing and were ...

00:11:32.979 --> 00:11:35.198
I went up to greet them, really excited,

00:11:35.222 --> 00:11:39.466
getting ready to thank them
for their gift of music,

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.719
and this young kid says to me --

00:11:43.443 --> 00:11:46.313
and he says it with the best
of intentions -- he says,

00:11:46.337 --> 00:11:53.301
"We're very proud, sir, to be keeping
alive the purest origins

00:11:53.325 --> 00:11:55.583
of our Mexican identity."

00:11:56.418 --> 00:11:59.334
And to tell you the truth,
I didn't really know what to say.

00:11:59.358 --> 00:12:00.387
(Laughter)

00:12:00.411 --> 00:12:03.576
I stood there looking at him.
I gave him a hug and left, but ...

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.866
(Laughter)

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.875
But he was right, too, though. Right?

00:12:06.899 --> 00:12:09.730
In reality, the Décima is its origin,
but at the same time,

00:12:09.754 --> 00:12:12.124
just like in the milonga
and in the Décima,

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:16.095
are the roots of many more cultures
from all over the place, like he said.

00:12:18.013 --> 00:12:21.690
Later, when I got back to the hotel,
I thought about it for a while.

00:12:21.714 --> 00:12:22.880
And I thought:

00:12:22.904 --> 00:12:25.808
things only look pure

00:12:27.093 --> 00:12:29.268
if you look at them from far away.

00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:33.386
It's very important
to know about our roots,

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:37.432
to know where we come from,
to understand our history.

00:12:37.456 --> 00:12:40.454
But at the same time, as important
as knowing where we're from,

00:12:40.478 --> 00:12:44.054
is understanding that deep down,

00:12:44.078 --> 00:12:46.038
we're not completely from one place,

00:12:46.062 --> 00:12:47.687
and a little from everywhere.

00:12:47.711 --> 00:12:48.936
Thank you very much.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:52.088
(Applause)

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.421
This is "The milonga of the Jewish Moor."

00:13:02.178 --> 00:13:05.462
(Music)

00:13:14.636 --> 00:13:16.637
(Sings)

00:13:16.661 --> 00:13:21.848
For every wall a lament
in Jerusalem the golden

00:13:24.236 --> 00:13:30.063
and 1000 wasted lives
for every commandment.

00:13:31.536 --> 00:13:37.246
I am dust in your wind
and although I bleed through your wound,

00:13:39.047 --> 00:13:44.713
and every beloved stone
has my deepest affection,

00:13:45.748 --> 00:13:52.044
there is not a stone in the world
worth more than a human life.

00:13:54.491 --> 00:14:01.427
I am a Jewish Moor
who lives among Christians

00:14:01.834 --> 00:14:08.698
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are.

00:14:10.211 --> 00:14:16.482
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are.

00:14:19.659 --> 00:14:25.190
There is not one death that does not
cause me pain, there are no winners

00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:33.042
there's nothing but suffering
and another life blown away.

00:14:34.496 --> 00:14:40.310
War is a terrible school
no matter what the disguise,

00:14:41.862 --> 00:14:47.394
forgive me for not enlisting
under any flag,

00:14:48.531 --> 00:14:55.428
any daydream is worth more
than a sad piece of cloth.

00:14:57.126 --> 00:15:03.961
I am a Jewish Moor
who lives among Christians

00:15:04.342 --> 00:15:11.082
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are.

00:15:12.511 --> 00:15:18.687
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are.

00:15:25.858 --> 00:15:30.859
And nobody has my permission
for killing in my name,

00:15:33.143 --> 00:15:39.302
a man is but a man
and if there is a God, this was his wish,

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:46.474
the very ground I tread
will live on, once I am gone

00:15:47.912 --> 00:15:53.641
on my way to oblivion, and all doctrines
will suffer the same fate,

00:15:54.126 --> 00:15:59.123
and there is not one nation
that has not proclaimed itself

00:15:59.147 --> 00:16:02.118
the chosen people.

00:16:03.807 --> 00:16:10.782
I am a Jewish Moor
who lives among Christians

00:16:10.806 --> 00:16:17.767
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are.

00:16:19.052 --> 00:16:24.879
I don't know who my God is,
nor who my brothers are.

00:16:24.903 --> 00:16:31.303
I am a Jewish Moor
who lives among Christians

00:16:32.084 --> 00:16:33.484
(Applause)

00:16:33.508 --> 00:16:34.674
Thank you.

00:16:34.698 --> 00:16:39.011
(Applause)
