00:00:13.692 --> 00:00:17.707
So two weeks ago, I searched
the word "nationalist" on Twitter.

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:19.950
The results were quite colorful,

00:00:19.974 --> 00:00:23.327
with expressions like,
"Emboldened Racist Moron," --

00:00:23.351 --> 00:00:24.361
(Laughter)

00:00:24.385 --> 00:00:26.510
"White Supremacist Idiot,"

00:00:26.534 --> 00:00:28.480
"Fascist Sock Puppets," --

00:00:28.504 --> 00:00:29.512
(Laughter)

00:00:29.536 --> 00:00:32.349
"Orwellian, Hitlerian, Terrifying."

00:00:32.373 --> 00:00:34.540
I then searched the word "globalist"

00:00:34.564 --> 00:00:37.766
and got things like,
"Socialist Sell-Outs,"

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.750
"Disgusting Corporate Propaganda,"

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:43.789
"Elitist Financial Overlords,"

00:00:43.813 --> 00:00:45.925
"Ruthless Cosmopolitan Rats."

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:47.015
(Laughter)

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.912
Even by social media standards,
the words are cruel and disgusting.

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.101
But they reflect the intensity
of one of the most fundamental questions

00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:57.324
of our times:

00:00:57.348 --> 00:01:01.024
Nationalism or globalism --
what is the best path forward?

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:03.925
This question impacts
everything we care about:

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.790
our cultural identity,

00:01:05.814 --> 00:01:07.629
our prosperity,

00:01:07.653 --> 00:01:09.784
our political systems --

00:01:09.808 --> 00:01:12.927
everything -- the health
of our planet -- everything.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.203
So on the one hand, we have nationalism.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.932
Collins defines it as
a "devotion to one's nation,"

00:01:19.956 --> 00:01:22.720
but also, a "doctrine that puts
national interests

00:01:22.744 --> 00:01:24.891
above international considerations."

00:01:25.364 --> 00:01:30.384
For nationalists, our modern societies
are built on national grounds:

00:01:30.408 --> 00:01:35.264
we share a land, a history, a culture,
and we defend each other.

00:01:35.288 --> 00:01:37.643
In a big and chaotic world,

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:42.422
they see nationalism as the only
sensible way to maintain social stability.

00:01:43.597 --> 00:01:46.032
But alarmed globalists warn us:

00:01:46.056 --> 00:01:49.329
self-centered nationalism
can easily turn ugly.

00:01:49.803 --> 00:01:52.511
We've seen it with 20th-century fascisms:

00:01:52.535 --> 00:01:57.020
bloody wars, millions of deaths,
immeasurable destruction.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.331
On the other hand, we have globalism.

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:02.008
The Oxford Living Dictionary
defines it as:

00:02:02.032 --> 00:02:05.383
"the operation or planning
of economic and foreign policy

00:02:05.407 --> 00:02:06.829
on a global basis."

00:02:07.574 --> 00:02:10.986
For nationalists, globalism
is rapidly deconstructing

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.638
what our ancestors took decades to build.

00:02:13.662 --> 00:02:16.048
It's like spitting on our soldiers' tombs;

00:02:16.072 --> 00:02:19.072
it's eroding our national solidarities

00:02:19.096 --> 00:02:22.211
and opening the doors
to foreign invasions.

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:27.465
But globalists make the case
that reinforcing our global governance

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.216
is the only way to tackle
big supernational problems,

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.011
like nuclear proliferation,

00:02:34.035 --> 00:02:36.201
the global refugee crisis,

00:02:36.225 --> 00:02:38.941
climate change or terrorism

00:02:38.965 --> 00:02:42.145
or even the consequences of superhuman AI.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.055
So we are at the crossroads,

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.926
and we are asked to choose:

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.288
nationalism or globalism?

00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:52.884
Having lived in four continents,

00:02:52.908 --> 00:02:55.232
I've always been interested
in this question.

00:02:55.256 --> 00:02:58.828
But it took a whole new level
when I saw this happening:

00:02:58.852 --> 00:03:03.121
the biggest surge in nationalist votes
in Western democracies

00:03:03.145 --> 00:03:04.643
since World War II.

00:03:05.413 --> 00:03:08.388
All of a sudden,
this isn't theory anymore.

00:03:08.412 --> 00:03:12.398
I mean, these political movements
have built their success with ideas

00:03:12.422 --> 00:03:15.532
that could mean, down the road,
losing my French citizenship

00:03:15.556 --> 00:03:17.246
because I'm North African

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.822
or not being able to come
back home to the US

00:03:19.846 --> 00:03:22.155
because I come from
a Muslim-majority country.

00:03:22.895 --> 00:03:25.016
You know, when you live in a democracy,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.949
you live with this idea that
your government will always protect you,

00:03:28.973 --> 00:03:30.994
as long as you abide by the laws.

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:34.293
With the rise of national populism,

00:03:34.317 --> 00:03:36.749
despite being the best citizen I can,

00:03:36.773 --> 00:03:40.351
I now have to live with the idea
that my government can hurt me

00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:42.126
for reasons I cannot control.

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.498
It's very unsettling.

00:03:44.522 --> 00:03:45.982
But it forced me to rethink

00:03:46.006 --> 00:03:49.394
and rethink this question
and try to think deeper.

00:03:49.418 --> 00:03:51.096
And the more I thought about it,

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.560
the more I started
questioning the question.

00:03:54.191 --> 00:03:57.581
Why would we have to choose
between nationalism and globalism,

00:03:57.605 --> 00:04:00.820
between loving our country
and caring for the world?

00:04:02.143 --> 00:04:03.448
There's no reason for that.

00:04:03.472 --> 00:04:05.842
We don't have to choose
between family and country

00:04:05.866 --> 00:04:07.915
or region or religion and country.

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:12.428
We already have multiple identities,
and we live with them very well.

00:04:12.798 --> 00:04:15.893
Why would we have to choose
between country and world?

00:04:16.491 --> 00:04:19.704
What if, instead of accepting
this absurd choice,

00:04:19.728 --> 00:04:23.899
we took it on ourselves to fight
this dangerous, binary thinking?

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:27.105
So for all the globalists in the audience,

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:28.446
I want to ask:

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.313
When I say the word "nationalist,"
what image comes to your mind?

00:04:33.031 --> 00:04:34.496
Something like this?

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.496
Believe me, I think of that, too.

00:04:36.823 --> 00:04:39.820
But I'd like you to remember
that for most people,

00:04:39.844 --> 00:04:41.859
nationalism feels more like this.

00:04:42.313 --> 00:04:43.818
Or maybe like that.

00:04:44.418 --> 00:04:46.342
You know, it's that thing inside you

00:04:46.366 --> 00:04:51.051
when you accidentally watch
an obscure Olympic sport on TV --

00:04:51.075 --> 00:04:53.307
(Laughter)

00:04:53.331 --> 00:04:54.392
wait --

00:04:54.416 --> 00:04:58.323
and the mere sight of an unknown athlete
wearing your national colors

00:04:58.347 --> 00:05:00.080
gets you all excited.

00:05:00.104 --> 00:05:01.818
Your heartbeat goes up,

00:05:01.842 --> 00:05:03.673
your stress level goes up,

00:05:03.697 --> 00:05:05.520
and you're standing in front of the TV

00:05:05.544 --> 00:05:08.175
and screaming with passion
for that athlete to win.

00:05:08.638 --> 00:05:09.788
That's nationalism.

00:05:09.812 --> 00:05:11.546
It's people happy to be together,

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.384
happy to belong to a large
national community.

00:05:14.901 --> 00:05:16.286
Why would it be wrong?

00:05:17.421 --> 00:05:19.770
You know, globalists,
you may think of nationalism

00:05:19.794 --> 00:05:23.596
as an old, 19th-century idea
that is destined to fade.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.356
But I'm sorry to tell you
that the facts are not on your side.

00:05:27.976 --> 00:05:31.804
When the World Values Survey
asked more than 89,000 people

00:05:31.828 --> 00:05:33.306
across 60 countries

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.982
how proud they felt about their country,

00:05:36.006 --> 00:05:39.929
88.5 percent said "very proud"
or "quite proud" --

00:05:39.953 --> 00:05:41.660
88.5 percent.

00:05:41.989 --> 00:05:44.846
Nationalism is not
going away anytime soon.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.773
It's a powerful feeling
that, according to another study,

00:05:49.797 --> 00:05:53.012
is a strong predictor
of individual happiness.

00:05:53.431 --> 00:05:58.586
It's crazy, but your happiness is more
correlated with national satisfaction

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.891
than with things you would expect,
like household income

00:06:01.915 --> 00:06:03.919
or your job satisfaction

00:06:03.943 --> 00:06:05.542
or your health satisfaction.

00:06:05.955 --> 00:06:08.567
So if nationalism makes people happy,

00:06:08.591 --> 00:06:10.793
why would anybody take it away from them?

00:06:11.666 --> 00:06:14.374
Fellow globalists, if you are like me,

00:06:14.398 --> 00:06:17.933
you may be attached to globalization
for humanistic reasons.

00:06:17.957 --> 00:06:22.640
And you may take great joy
in some of its accomplishments since 1945.

00:06:22.664 --> 00:06:26.263
After all, major regions of the world
have been exceptionally peaceful;

00:06:26.664 --> 00:06:30.482
extreme poverty rates around
the globe are trending down;

00:06:30.506 --> 00:06:33.682
and more than two billion people,
most notably in Asia,

00:06:33.706 --> 00:06:36.607
show spectacular improvements
in their standards of living.

00:06:37.266 --> 00:06:41.567
But studies also show
that globalization has a dark side.

00:06:41.591 --> 00:06:44.503
And left on the side of the road

00:06:44.527 --> 00:06:48.292
are hundreds of millions of people
in Western middle classes

00:06:48.316 --> 00:06:51.101
with anemic income growth
for more than two decades,

00:06:51.125 --> 00:06:53.683
possibly three decades,
according to some studies.

00:06:54.031 --> 00:06:56.991
We cannot ignore
this elephant in our room.

00:06:57.015 --> 00:06:59.648
If anything, our collective energy
would be better used

00:06:59.672 --> 00:07:03.069
finding ways to fix this aspect
of globalization,

00:07:03.093 --> 00:07:07.910
instead of fighting this polarizing battle
against nationalism.

00:07:08.547 --> 00:07:10.832
So now, the nationalists in the audience,

00:07:10.856 --> 00:07:14.160
I have some crusty,
nonbinary nuggets for you.

00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:15.466
(Laughter)

00:07:16.211 --> 00:07:18.878
When I say the word "globalist,"
what comes to your mind?

00:07:19.496 --> 00:07:21.819
Out-of-touch, one-percent plutocrats?

00:07:21.843 --> 00:07:23.246
(Laughter)

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.091
Or maybe the heartless,
greedy Wall Street type, right?

00:07:26.402 --> 00:07:28.860
Or maybe people like me,
with multiple origins,

00:07:28.884 --> 00:07:31.747
living in a big, cosmopolitan metropolis.

00:07:32.696 --> 00:07:35.997
Well, you remember that World
Values Survey that I mentioned earlier?

00:07:36.428 --> 00:07:39.050
It showed another fascinating finding:

00:07:39.074 --> 00:07:43.393
71 percent of the world population
agreed with the statement,

00:07:43.417 --> 00:07:45.238
"I am a citizen of the world."

00:07:45.262 --> 00:07:46.518
Do you know what it means?

00:07:47.094 --> 00:07:50.323
Most of us are simultaneously
proud of our country

00:07:50.347 --> 00:07:52.161
and citizens of the world.

00:07:52.185 --> 00:07:53.717
And it gets even better.

00:07:53.741 --> 00:07:58.182
The citizens of the world in the survey
show a higher level of national pride

00:07:58.206 --> 00:08:00.190
than the ones that rejected that label.

00:08:00.754 --> 00:08:04.505
So once and for all, being a globalist
doesn't mean betraying your country.

00:08:04.529 --> 00:08:06.926
It just means that you have
enough social empathy,

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.994
and you project some of it outside
your national borders.

00:08:11.248 --> 00:08:14.732
Now, I know that when I dig
into my own nationalist feelings,

00:08:14.756 --> 00:08:17.794
one of my anxieties versus
the globalized world

00:08:17.818 --> 00:08:19.729
is national identity:

00:08:19.753 --> 00:08:22.948
How are we going to preserve
what makes us special,

00:08:22.972 --> 00:08:24.258
what makes us different,

00:08:24.282 --> 00:08:25.916
what brings us together?

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.922
And as I started thinking about it,
I realized something really strange,

00:08:29.946 --> 00:08:33.856
which is that a lot of the key ingredients
of our national identities

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.585
actually come from outside
our national borders.

00:08:37.032 --> 00:08:39.345
Like, think of the letters
that we use every day.

00:08:39.705 --> 00:08:41.097
I don't know if you realize,

00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:44.933
but the Latin script, the Latin
alphabet that we use

00:08:44.957 --> 00:08:47.316
has its origins thousands of years ago,

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.635
near the Nile River.

00:08:49.082 --> 00:08:52.412
It all started with a cow just like this,

00:08:52.436 --> 00:08:56.685
that was captured by a scribe
into an elegant hieroglyph.

00:08:57.233 --> 00:09:00.796
That hieroglyph was transcribed
by a Semite in the Sinai

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.268
into the letter aleph.

00:09:02.972 --> 00:09:08.012
Aleph traveled with Phoenicians
and reached the European shores in Greece,

00:09:08.036 --> 00:09:09.474
where it became alpha,

00:09:09.498 --> 00:09:11.048
the mother of our letter A.

00:09:11.555 --> 00:09:14.890
So that's how an Egyptian cow
became our letter A.

00:09:14.914 --> 00:09:16.235
(Laughter)

00:09:16.865 --> 00:09:22.927
And same thing with the Egyptian house
that became bet, beta and B.

00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:27.173
And the Egyptian fish
that became daleth, delta and D.

00:09:27.681 --> 00:09:31.082
Our most fundamental texts
are full of Egyptian cows,

00:09:31.106 --> 00:09:32.613
houses and fish.

00:09:32.637 --> 00:09:33.922
(Laughter)

00:09:34.565 --> 00:09:36.788
And there are so many other examples.

00:09:36.812 --> 00:09:39.572
Take the United Kingdom and its monarchy.

00:09:39.596 --> 00:09:41.583
Queen Elizabeth II?

00:09:41.607 --> 00:09:42.969
German ancestry.

00:09:43.384 --> 00:09:45.697
The mottos on the royal coat of arms?

00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:48.398
All written in French,
not a single word of English.

00:09:49.117 --> 00:09:52.896
Take France and it's iconic Eiffel Tower.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.282
The inspiration?

00:09:54.754 --> 00:09:56.750
The United States of America --

00:09:56.774 --> 00:09:58.068
and I don't mean Las Vegas,

00:09:58.092 --> 00:09:59.850
I mean 19th-century New York.

00:09:59.874 --> 00:10:00.961
(Laughter)

00:10:00.985 --> 00:10:04.502
This was the tallest building
in New York in the mid-19th century.

00:10:04.526 --> 00:10:06.147
Does it remind you of something?

00:10:07.147 --> 00:10:10.586
And you may think of China
as a self-contained civilization,

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.739
protected behind its Great Wall.

00:10:12.763 --> 00:10:14.281
But think twice.

00:10:14.305 --> 00:10:16.351
The Chinese official ideology?

00:10:16.375 --> 00:10:19.122
Marxism, made in Germany.

00:10:20.064 --> 00:10:21.709
One of China's biggest religions?

00:10:21.733 --> 00:10:24.341
Buddhism, imported from India.

00:10:24.365 --> 00:10:26.650
India's favorite pastime?

00:10:26.674 --> 00:10:27.890
Cricket.

00:10:28.222 --> 00:10:30.640
I really love this quote from Ashis Nandy,

00:10:30.664 --> 00:10:35.541
who said, "Cricket is an Indian game
accidentally discovered by the British."

00:10:35.565 --> 00:10:37.123
(Laughter)

00:10:37.147 --> 00:10:43.692
So these are good reminders that a lot
of what we love in our national traditions

00:10:43.716 --> 00:10:46.382
actually come from previous
waves of globalization.

00:10:46.835 --> 00:10:50.539
And beyond individual symbols,
there are whole national traditions

00:10:50.563 --> 00:10:53.621
that could not have existed
without globalization.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:58.375
And the example that comes to my mind
is a world-beloved national tradition:

00:10:58.399 --> 00:10:59.685
Italian cuisine.

00:11:00.056 --> 00:11:01.860
My friends, if you ever have a chance

00:11:01.884 --> 00:11:04.448
to go to a superauthentic
Italian restaurant

00:11:04.472 --> 00:11:07.117
that only serves ancient Roman recipes,

00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:09.627
my advice for you is: don't go.

00:11:09.651 --> 00:11:11.078
(Laughter)

00:11:11.102 --> 00:11:12.925
You'd get very, very disappointed.

00:11:13.353 --> 00:11:15.217
No spaghetti, no pasta --

00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:18.105
that really started in Sicily
in the eighth century,

00:11:18.129 --> 00:11:19.831
when it was under Arabian rule.

00:11:20.407 --> 00:11:23.044
No perfect espresso,
no creamy cappuccino --

00:11:23.068 --> 00:11:26.901
that came from Abyssinia
via Yemen in the 17th century.

00:11:26.925 --> 00:11:29.434
And of course,
no perfect pizza Napoletana --

00:11:29.458 --> 00:11:32.649
how would you make it without
the tomatoes of the New World?

00:11:33.736 --> 00:11:37.775
No, instead, you would be served
probably a lot of porridge,

00:11:37.799 --> 00:11:41.456
some vegetable -- mostly
cabbage -- some cheese,

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.186
and maybe if you're lucky,

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.332
the absolute delicacy of that time --

00:11:46.356 --> 00:11:49.887
mmm, perfectly cooked fattened dormice.

00:11:49.911 --> 00:11:51.128
(Laughter)

00:11:52.115 --> 00:11:56.407
Thankfully, it was not a close tradition
preserved by fanatic watchdogs.

00:11:56.431 --> 00:11:58.084
No, it was an open process,

00:11:58.108 --> 00:12:03.997
nourished by explorers, traders,
street sellers and innovative home cooks.

00:12:04.021 --> 00:12:06.087
And in many ways,
globalization is a chance

00:12:06.111 --> 00:12:11.374
for our national traditions to be
questioned, regenerated, reinterpreted,

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:15.361
to attract new converts
to stay vibrant and relevant over time.

00:12:15.841 --> 00:12:17.134
So just remember this:

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.178
most of us nationalists
in the world are globalists,

00:12:20.202 --> 00:12:23.022
and most of us globalists
in the world are nationalists.

00:12:23.046 --> 00:12:26.111
A lot of what we like
in our national traditions

00:12:26.135 --> 00:12:28.451
come from outside our national borders.

00:12:28.475 --> 00:12:31.197
And the reason we venture
outside our national borders

00:12:31.221 --> 00:12:33.917
is to discover these other
national traditions.

00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:35.660
So the real question should not be

00:12:35.684 --> 00:12:38.370
to choose between
nationalism and globalism.

00:12:38.394 --> 00:12:41.908
The real questions is:
How can we do both better?

00:12:41.932 --> 00:12:44.783
It's a complex question
for a complex world

00:12:44.807 --> 00:12:48.310
that calls for creative,
nonbinary solutions.

00:12:48.334 --> 00:12:49.691
What are you waiting for?

00:12:49.715 --> 00:12:50.866
Thank you.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:52.690
(Applause)
