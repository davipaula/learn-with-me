00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:16.230
A briefcase full of poop changed my life.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.690
Ten years ago, I was a graduate student

00:00:18.714 --> 00:00:21.388
and I was helping judge
a genetic engineering competition

00:00:21.412 --> 00:00:22.633
for undergrads.

00:00:22.657 --> 00:00:26.598
There, I met a British artist and designer
named Alexandra Daisy Ginsberg.

00:00:26.622 --> 00:00:29.003
She was wearing the white
embroidered polo shirt

00:00:29.027 --> 00:00:30.756
of the University of Cambridge team

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.360
and holding a silver briefcase,

00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:35.668
like the kind that you would imagine
is handcuffed to your wrist.

00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:37.476
She gestured over from a quiet corner

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.500
and asked me if I wanted to see something.

00:00:39.803 --> 00:00:42.033
With a sneaky look,
she opened up the suitcase,

00:00:42.057 --> 00:00:47.172
and inside were six glorious,
multicolored turds.

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.283
The Cambridge team, she explained,

00:00:49.307 --> 00:00:52.220
had spent their summer
engineering the bacteria E. coli

00:00:52.244 --> 00:00:55.006
to be able to sense different things
in the environment

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.974
and produce a rainbow
of different colors in response.

00:00:57.998 --> 00:00:59.727
Arsenic in your drinking water?

00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:01.320
This strain would turn green.

00:01:01.344 --> 00:01:03.725
She and her collaborator,
the designer James King,

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:07.042
worked with the students and imagined
the different possible scenarios

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.828
of how you might use these bacteria.

00:01:08.852 --> 00:01:10.880
What if, they asked, you could use them

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:15.190
as a living probiotic drink
and health monitor, all in one?

00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:18.553
You could drink the bacteria
and it would live in your gut,

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:19.868
sensing what's going on,

00:01:19.892 --> 00:01:21.520
and then in response to something,

00:01:21.544 --> 00:01:23.812
it would be able to produce
a colored output.

00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:25.003
Holy shit!

00:01:25.027 --> 00:01:26.606
The Cambridge team went on to win

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.503
the International Genetically Engineered
Machine competition,

00:01:29.527 --> 00:01:30.887
or iGEM for short.

00:01:30.911 --> 00:01:34.220
And as for me, those turds
were a turning point.

00:01:34.744 --> 00:01:36.315
I am a synthetic biologist,

00:01:36.339 --> 00:01:39.617
which is probably a weird term
that most people aren't familiar with.

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:41.696
It definitely sounds like an oxymoron.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.010
How can biology, something natural,

00:01:44.034 --> 00:01:45.201
be synthetic?

00:01:45.225 --> 00:01:48.280
How can something artificial be alive?

00:01:48.788 --> 00:01:50.703
Synthetic biologists sort of poke holes

00:01:50.727 --> 00:01:55.006
in that boundary that we draw between
what is natural and what's technological.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.680
And every year, iGEM students
from all over the world

00:01:57.704 --> 00:01:58.918
spend their summer

00:01:58.942 --> 00:02:02.010
trying to engineer biology
to be technology.

00:02:02.034 --> 00:02:04.749
They teach bacteria how to play sudoku,

00:02:04.773 --> 00:02:07.641
they make multicolored spider silk,

00:02:07.665 --> 00:02:09.815
they make self-healing concrete

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:13.141
and tissue printers
and plastic-eating bacteria.

00:02:13.165 --> 00:02:14.561
Up until that moment, though,

00:02:14.585 --> 00:02:17.800
I was a little bit more concerned
with a different kind of oxymoron.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.236
Just plain old genetic engineering.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.348
The comedian Simon Munnery once wrote

00:02:22.372 --> 00:02:27.264
that genetic engineering is actually
insulting to proper engineering.

00:02:27.288 --> 00:02:31.153
Genetic engineering is more like throwing
a bunch of concrete and steel in a river

00:02:31.177 --> 00:02:33.967
and if somebody can walk across,
you call it a bridge.

00:02:34.411 --> 00:02:37.196
And so synthetic biologists
were pretty worried about this,

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.910
and worried that genetic engineering
was a little bit more art that science.

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:45.472
They wanted to turn genetic engineering
into a real engineering discipline,

00:02:45.496 --> 00:02:49.401
where we could program cells and write DNA

00:02:49.425 --> 00:02:53.093
the way that engineers write
software for computers.

00:02:53.117 --> 00:02:57.641
That day 10 years ago started me on a path
that gets me to where I am now.

00:02:57.665 --> 00:02:59.283
Today, I'm the creative director

00:02:59.307 --> 00:03:02.131
at a synthetic biology company
called Ginkgo Bioworks.

00:03:02.433 --> 00:03:04.154
"Creative director" is a weird title

00:03:04.178 --> 00:03:06.734
for a biotech company
were people try to program life

00:03:06.758 --> 00:03:08.758
the way that we program computers.

00:03:09.165 --> 00:03:11.220
But that day when I met Daisy,

00:03:11.244 --> 00:03:13.085
I learned something about engineering.

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.949
I learned that engineering
isn't really just about equations

00:03:15.973 --> 00:03:17.750
and steel and circuits,

00:03:17.774 --> 00:03:19.790
it's actually about people.

00:03:19.814 --> 00:03:22.329
It's something that people do,
and it impacts us.

00:03:22.353 --> 00:03:23.561
So in my work,

00:03:23.585 --> 00:03:27.233
I try to open up new spaces
for different kinds of engineering.

00:03:27.633 --> 00:03:29.966
How can we ask better questions,

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.721
and can we have better conversations

00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:34.188
about what we want
from the future of technology?

00:03:34.212 --> 00:03:36.783
How can we understand the technological

00:03:36.807 --> 00:03:39.664
but also social and political
and economic reasons

00:03:39.688 --> 00:03:42.458
that GMOs are so polarizing
in our society?

00:03:42.482 --> 00:03:44.482
Can we make GMOs that people love?

00:03:45.315 --> 00:03:50.939
Can we use biology to make technology
that's more expansive and regenerative?

00:03:50.963 --> 00:03:54.733
I think it starts by recognizing
that we, as synthetic biologists,

00:03:54.757 --> 00:03:58.680
are also shaped by a culture
that values "real engineering"

00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:00.704
more than any of the squishy stuff.

00:04:01.561 --> 00:04:05.590
We get so caught up in circuits
and what happens inside of computers,

00:04:05.614 --> 00:04:09.256
that we sometimes lose sight of the magic
that's happening inside of us.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.918
There is plenty of shitty
technology out there,

00:04:11.942 --> 00:04:16.410
but this was the first time
that I imagined poop as technology.

00:04:16.434 --> 00:04:19.966
I began to see that synthetic
biology was awesome,

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.752
not because we could turn
cells into computers,

00:04:22.776 --> 00:04:25.585
but because we could bring
technology to life.

00:04:25.609 --> 00:04:27.498
This was technology that was visceral,

00:04:27.522 --> 00:04:30.672
an unforgettable vision
of what the future might hold.

00:04:30.696 --> 00:04:33.149
But importantly, it was also
framed as the question

00:04:33.173 --> 00:04:35.577
"Is this the kind of future
that we actually want?"

00:04:35.601 --> 00:04:38.077
We've been promised a future of chrome,

00:04:38.101 --> 00:04:40.982
but what if the future is fleshy?

00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:43.117
Science and science fiction

00:04:43.141 --> 00:04:45.728
help us remember
that we're made of star stuff.

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:48.426
But can it also help us remember
the wonder and weirdness

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.125
of being made of flesh?

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:51.434
Biology is us,

00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:53.664
it's our bodies, it's what we eat.

00:04:53.688 --> 00:04:57.000
What happens when biology
becomes technology?

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:59.788
These images are questions,

00:04:59.812 --> 00:05:03.470
and they challenge what we think of
as normal and desirable.

00:05:03.796 --> 00:05:06.723
And they also show us
that the future is full of choices

00:05:06.747 --> 00:05:08.747
and that we could choose differently.

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:12.556
What's the future of the body, of beauty?

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.133
If we change the body,
will we have new kinds of awareness?

00:05:16.506 --> 00:05:19.184
And will new kinds of awareness
of the microbial world

00:05:19.208 --> 00:05:21.106
change the way that we eat?

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.643
The last chapter of my dissertation
was all about cheese that I made

00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:27.733
using bacteria that I swabbed
from in between my toes.

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.434
I told you that the poop changed my life.

00:05:30.458 --> 00:05:33.220
I worked with the smell artist
and researcher Sissel Tolaas

00:05:33.244 --> 00:05:38.288
to explore all of the ways
that our bodies and cheese are connected

00:05:38.312 --> 00:05:41.058
through smell and therefore microbes.

00:05:41.082 --> 00:05:42.518
And we created this cheese

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:45.474
to challenge how we think
about the bacteria

00:05:45.498 --> 00:05:46.958
that's part of our lives

00:05:46.982 --> 00:05:49.458
and the bacteria
that we work with in the lab.

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:51.704
We are, indeed, what we eat.

00:05:51.728 --> 00:05:53.918
The intersection of biology and technology

00:05:53.942 --> 00:05:58.029
is more often told as a story
of transcending our fleshy realities.

00:05:58.053 --> 00:06:00.086
If you can upload
your brain to a computer,

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.078
you don't need to poop anymore after all.

00:06:02.102 --> 00:06:05.177
And that's usually a story
that's told as a good thing, right?

00:06:05.201 --> 00:06:10.518
Because computers are clean,
and biology is messy.

00:06:10.542 --> 00:06:13.141
Computers make sense and are rational,

00:06:13.165 --> 00:06:16.500
and biology is an unpredictable tangle.

00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:18.721
It kind of follows from there

00:06:18.745 --> 00:06:21.950
that science and technology
are supposed to be rational,

00:06:21.974 --> 00:06:23.426
objective

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.403
and pure,

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:28.048
and it's humans that are a total mess.

00:06:28.407 --> 00:06:30.645
But like synthetic biologists poke holes

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:33.701
in that line between nature
and technology,

00:06:33.725 --> 00:06:36.201
artists, designers and social scientists

00:06:36.225 --> 00:06:40.498
showed me that the lines that we draw
between nature, technology and society

00:06:40.522 --> 00:06:42.895
are a little bit softer
than we might think.

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:46.399
They challenge us to reconsider
our visions for the future

00:06:46.423 --> 00:06:49.360
and our fantasies
about controlling nature.

00:06:49.384 --> 00:06:52.971
They show us how our prejudices,
our hopes and our values

00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:55.222
are embedded in science and technology

00:06:55.246 --> 00:06:58.229
through the questions that we ask
and the choices that we make.

00:06:58.253 --> 00:07:02.601
They make visible the ways
that science and technology are human

00:07:02.625 --> 00:07:04.260
and therefore political.

00:07:04.284 --> 00:07:06.768
What does it mean for us
to be able to control life

00:07:06.792 --> 00:07:08.339
for our own purposes?

00:07:08.363 --> 00:07:10.212
The artists Oron Catts and Ionat Zurr

00:07:10.236 --> 00:07:12.371
made a project
called "Victimless Leather,"

00:07:12.395 --> 00:07:15.283
where they engineered
a tiny leather jacket

00:07:15.307 --> 00:07:16.776
out of mouse cells.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.990
Is this jacket alive?

00:07:19.014 --> 00:07:22.291
What does it take to grow it
and keep it this way?

00:07:22.315 --> 00:07:23.910
Is it really victimless?

00:07:23.934 --> 00:07:26.545
And what does it mean
for something to be victimless?

00:07:27.022 --> 00:07:28.236
The choices that we make

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.760
in what we show and what we hide
in our stories of progress,

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:35.487
are often political choices
that have real consequences.

00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:39.764
How will genetic technologies
shape the way that we understand ourselves

00:07:39.788 --> 00:07:41.217
and define our bodies?

00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:43.839
The artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg
made these faces

00:07:43.863 --> 00:07:46.918
based on DNA sequences
she extracted from sidewalk litter,

00:07:46.942 --> 00:07:50.145
forcing us to ask questions
about genetic privacy,

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:53.867
but also how and whether
DNA can really define us.

00:07:54.249 --> 00:07:57.387
How will we fight against
and cope with climate change?

00:07:57.411 --> 00:07:59.633
Will we change the way
that we make everything,

00:07:59.657 --> 00:08:03.760
using biological materials
that can grow and decay alongside us?

00:08:03.784 --> 00:08:06.077
Will we change our own bodies?

00:08:06.101 --> 00:08:07.942
Or nature itself?

00:08:07.966 --> 00:08:12.076
Or can we change the system
that keeps reinforcing those boundaries

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.196
between science, society,
nature and technology?

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:19.561
Relationships that today keep us
locked in these unsustainable patterns.

00:08:19.585 --> 00:08:21.783
How we understand and respond to crises

00:08:21.807 --> 00:08:24.847
that are natural, technical
and social all at once,

00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:27.116
from coronavirus to climate change,

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:28.847
is deeply political,

00:08:28.871 --> 00:08:31.577
and science never happens in a vacuum.

00:08:32.165 --> 00:08:33.379
Let's go back in time

00:08:33.403 --> 00:08:35.932
to when the first European settlers
arrived in Hawaii.

00:08:36.488 --> 00:08:40.004
They eventually brought their cattle
and their scientists with them.

00:08:40.028 --> 00:08:42.203
The cattle roamed the hillsides,

00:08:42.227 --> 00:08:45.137
trampling and changing
the ecosystems as they went.

00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:48.629
The scientists catalogued the species
that they found there,

00:08:48.653 --> 00:08:51.685
often taking the last specimen
before they went extinct.

00:08:52.117 --> 00:08:54.331
This is the Maui hau kuahiwi,

00:08:54.355 --> 00:08:56.561
or the Hibiscadelphus wilderianus,

00:08:56.585 --> 00:08:58.967
so named by Gerrit Wilder in 1910.

00:08:59.276 --> 00:09:01.855
By 1912, it was extinct.

00:09:01.879 --> 00:09:05.164
I found this specimen
in the Harvard University Herbarium,

00:09:05.188 --> 00:09:09.352
where it's housed with five million
other specimens from all over the world.

00:09:09.376 --> 00:09:12.114
I wanted to take a piece
of science's past,

00:09:12.138 --> 00:09:14.296
tied up as it was with colonialism,

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.712
and all of the embedded ideas

00:09:15.736 --> 00:09:19.807
of the way that nature and science
and society should work together,

00:09:19.831 --> 00:09:22.664
and ask questions about science's future.

00:09:23.109 --> 00:09:25.014
Working with an awesome team at Ginkgo,

00:09:25.038 --> 00:09:26.982
and others at UC Santa Cruz,

00:09:27.006 --> 00:09:29.609
we were able to extract
a little bit of the DNA

00:09:29.633 --> 00:09:32.133
from a tiny sliver of this plant specimen

00:09:32.157 --> 00:09:34.268
and to sequence the DNA inside.

00:09:34.292 --> 00:09:37.439
And then resynthesize a possible version

00:09:37.463 --> 00:09:40.629
of the genes that made
the smell of the plant.

00:09:40.653 --> 00:09:43.026
By inserting those genes into yeast,

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.563
we could produce little bits of that smell

00:09:45.587 --> 00:09:47.325
and be able to, maybe, smell

00:09:47.349 --> 00:09:49.658
a little bit of something
that's lost forever.

00:09:49.682 --> 00:09:51.705
Working again with Daisy
and Sissel Tolaas,

00:09:51.729 --> 00:09:54.218
my collaborator on the cheese project,

00:09:54.242 --> 00:09:58.276
we reconstructed and composed
a new smell of that flower,

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.331
and created an installation
where people could experience it,

00:10:01.355 --> 00:10:04.751
to be part of this natural history
and synthetic future.

00:10:06.482 --> 00:10:08.530
Ten years ago, I was a synthetic biologist

00:10:08.554 --> 00:10:11.529
worried that genetic engineering
was more art than science

00:10:11.553 --> 00:10:13.220
and that people were too messy

00:10:13.244 --> 00:10:15.244
and biology was too complicated.

00:10:15.641 --> 00:10:18.601
Now I use genetic engineering as art

00:10:18.625 --> 00:10:21.645
to explore all the different ways
that we are entangled together

00:10:21.669 --> 00:10:23.899
and imagine different possible futures.

00:10:23.923 --> 00:10:25.622
A fleshy future

00:10:25.646 --> 00:10:28.942
is one that does recognize
all those interconnections

00:10:28.966 --> 00:10:31.624
and the human realities of technology.

00:10:31.927 --> 00:10:35.439
But it also recognizes
the incredible power of biology,

00:10:35.463 --> 00:10:37.408
its resilience and sustainability,

00:10:37.432 --> 00:10:40.431
its ability to heal and grow and adapt.

00:10:40.455 --> 00:10:42.418
Values that are so necessary

00:10:42.442 --> 00:10:45.037
for the visions of the futures
that we can have today.

00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:47.371
Technology will shape that future,

00:10:47.395 --> 00:10:49.395
but humans make technology.

00:10:49.696 --> 00:10:52.309
How we decide what that future will be

00:10:52.333 --> 00:10:53.746
is up to all of us.

00:10:54.556 --> 00:10:55.738
Thank you.
