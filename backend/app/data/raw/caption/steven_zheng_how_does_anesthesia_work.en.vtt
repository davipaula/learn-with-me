00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:07.883
If you've had surgery,

00:00:07.883 --> 00:00:11.116
you might remember starting to count
backwards from ten,

00:00:11.116 --> 00:00:12.368
nine,

00:00:12.368 --> 00:00:13.461
eight,

00:00:13.461 --> 00:00:18.853
and then waking up with the surgery
already over before you even got to five.

00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:21.968
And it might seem like you were asleep,
but you weren't.

00:00:21.968 --> 00:00:23.844
You were under anesthesia,

00:00:23.844 --> 00:00:25.636
which is much more complicated.

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:26.665
You were unconscious,

00:00:26.665 --> 00:00:28.399
but you also couldn't move,

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:29.622
form memories,

00:00:29.622 --> 00:00:32.225
or, hopefully, feel pain.

00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:35.180
Without being able to block all those
processes at once,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.060
many surgeries would be 
way too traumatic to perform.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.397
Ancient medical texts from Egypt,
Asia and the Middle East

00:00:42.397 --> 00:00:44.810
all describe early anesthetics

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.927
containing things like opium poppy,

00:00:46.927 --> 00:00:48.309
mandrake fruit,

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:49.977
and alcohol.

00:00:49.977 --> 00:00:52.188
Today, anesthesiologists often combine

00:00:52.188 --> 00:00:56.142
regional, inhalational 
and intravenous agents

00:00:56.142 --> 00:00:58.831
to get the right balance for a surgery.

00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:03.111
Regional anesthesia blocks pain signals
from a specific part of the body

00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:04.908
from getting to the brain.

00:01:04.908 --> 00:01:10.139
Pain and other messages travel through
the nervous system as electrical impulses.

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:14.388
Regional anesthetics work by setting up
an electrical barricade.

00:01:14.388 --> 00:01:18.271
They bind to the proteins 
in neurons' cell membranes

00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:20.906
that let charged particles in and out,

00:01:20.906 --> 00:01:23.987
and lock out positively charged particles.

00:01:23.987 --> 00:01:26.973
One compound that does this is cocaine,

00:01:26.973 --> 00:01:29.896
whose painkilling effects 
were discovered by accident

00:01:29.896 --> 00:01:33.999
when an ophthalmology intern
got some on his tongue.

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:37.021
It's still occasionally used 
as an anesthetic,

00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:39.430
but many of the more common
regional anesthetics

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.351
have a similar chemical structure
and work the same way.

00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:46.180
But for major surgeries where you need
to be unconscious,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.483
you'll want something that acts
on the entire nervous system,

00:01:49.483 --> 00:01:51.316
including the brain.

00:01:51.316 --> 00:01:54.070
That's what inhalational anesthetics do.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.594
In Western medicine, diethyl ether
was the first common one.

00:01:58.594 --> 00:02:01.384
It was best known as a recreational drug

00:02:01.384 --> 00:02:05.464
until doctors started to realize that
people sometimes didn't notice

00:02:05.464 --> 00:02:08.298
injuries they received 
under the influence.

00:02:08.298 --> 00:02:12.444
In the 1840s, they started sedating
patients with ether

00:02:12.444 --> 00:02:15.332
during dental extractions and surgeries.

00:02:15.332 --> 00:02:19.149
Nitrous oxide became popular
in the decades that followed

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:20.826
and is still used today.

00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:25.007
although ether derivatives, 
like sevoflurane, are more common.

00:02:25.007 --> 00:02:30.138
Inhalational anesthesia is usually 
supplemented with intravenous anesthesia,

00:02:30.138 --> 00:02:32.996
which was developed in the 1870s.

00:02:32.996 --> 00:02:36.150
Common intravenous agents include
sedatives, like propofol,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.884
which induce unconsciousness,

00:02:37.884 --> 00:02:42.188
and opioids, like fentanyl, 
which reduce pain.

00:02:42.188 --> 00:02:44.836
These general anesthetics 
also seem to work

00:02:44.836 --> 00:02:47.907
by affecting electrical signals
in the nervous system.

00:02:47.907 --> 00:02:51.754
Normally, the brain's electrical signals
are a chaotic chorus

00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:55.126
as different parts of the brain
communicate with each other.

00:02:55.126 --> 00:02:58.693
That connectivity keeps you awake
and aware.

00:02:58.693 --> 00:03:00.426
But as someone becomes anesthetized,

00:03:00.426 --> 00:03:03.549
those signals become calmer
and more organized,

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.657
suggesting that different 
parts of the brain

00:03:05.657 --> 00:03:08.164
aren't talking to each other anymore.

00:03:08.164 --> 00:03:12.800
There's a lot we still don't know
about exactly how this happens.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.771
Several common anesthetics bind to
the GABA-A receptor in the brain's neurons.

00:03:18.771 --> 00:03:20.598
They hold the gateway open,

00:03:20.598 --> 00:03:25.030
letting negatively charged particles
flow into the cell.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.241
Negative charge builds up
and acts like a log jam,

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:31.842
keeping the neuron from transmitting
electrical signals.

00:03:31.842 --> 00:03:35.444
The nervous system has lots
of these gated channels,

00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:37.349
controlling pathways for movement,

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.419
memory,

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:39.779
and consciousness.

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:42.864
Most anesthetics probably 
act on more than one,

00:03:42.864 --> 00:03:45.276
and they don't act on 
just the nervous system.

00:03:45.276 --> 00:03:47.461
Many anesthetics also affect the heart,

00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:48.386
lungs,

00:03:48.386 --> 00:03:50.417
and other vital organs.

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:52.022
Just like early anesthetics,

00:03:52.022 --> 00:03:55.586
which included familiar poisons like
hemlock and aconite,

00:03:55.586 --> 00:03:58.155
modern drugs can 
have serious side effects.

00:03:58.155 --> 00:04:02.298
So an anesthesiologist has to mix
just the right balance of drugs

00:04:02.298 --> 00:04:04.997
to create all the features of anesthesia,

00:04:04.997 --> 00:04:08.019
while carefully monitoring
the patient's vital signs,

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.876
and adjusting the drug mixture as needed.

00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:13.031
Anesthesia is complicated,

00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:14.607
but figuring out how to use it

00:04:14.607 --> 00:04:18.849
allowed for the development 
of new and better surgical techniques.

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:23.460
Surgeons could learn how to routinely
and safely perform C-sections,

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.167
reopen blocked arteries,

00:04:25.167 --> 00:04:27.550
replace damaged livers and kidneys,

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.407
and many other life-saving operations.

00:04:30.407 --> 00:04:33.970
And each year, new anesthesia techniques
are developed

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.496
that will ensure more and more patients
survive the trauma of surgery.
