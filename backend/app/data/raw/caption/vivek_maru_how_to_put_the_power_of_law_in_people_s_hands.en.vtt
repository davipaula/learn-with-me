00:00:12.786 --> 00:00:14.468
I want to tell you about someone.

00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:17.302
I'm going to call him Ravi Nanda.

00:00:17.326 --> 00:00:19.523
I'm changing his name
to protect his safety.

00:00:20.592 --> 00:00:24.307
Ravi's from a community
of herdspeople in Gujarat

00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:26.532
on the western coast of India,

00:00:26.556 --> 00:00:28.492
same place my own family comes from.

00:00:30.048 --> 00:00:35.434
When he was 10 years old,
his entire community was forced to move

00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:37.546
because a multinational corporation

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.029
constructed a manufacturing facility
on the land where they lived.

00:00:42.263 --> 00:00:48.132
Then, 20 years later,
the same company built a cement factory

00:00:48.156 --> 00:00:50.505
100 meters from where they live now.

00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:56.160
India has got strong
environmental regulations on paper,

00:00:56.184 --> 00:00:58.731
but this company
has violated many of them.

00:00:59.873 --> 00:01:02.910
Dust from that factory
covers Ravi's mustache

00:01:02.934 --> 00:01:04.412
and everything he wears.

00:01:05.135 --> 00:01:08.738
I spent just two days in his place,
and I coughed for a week.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.374
Ravi says that if people or animals
eat anything that grows in his village

00:01:15.398 --> 00:01:17.079
or drink the water,

00:01:17.103 --> 00:01:18.341
they get sick.

00:01:19.673 --> 00:01:24.467
He says children now walk
long distances with cattle and buffalo

00:01:24.491 --> 00:01:27.141
to find uncontaminated grazing land.

00:01:28.396 --> 00:01:31.879
He says many of those kids
have dropped out of school,

00:01:31.903 --> 00:01:33.269
including three of his own.

00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:38.148
Ravi has appealed
to the company for years.

00:01:38.767 --> 00:01:43.038
He said, "I've written so many letters
my family could cremate me with them.

00:01:43.062 --> 00:01:44.842
They wouldn't need to buy any wood."

00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:46.286
(Laughter)

00:01:47.268 --> 00:01:51.861
He said the company ignored
every one of those letters,

00:01:51.885 --> 00:01:53.875
and so in 2013,

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.136
Ravi Nanda decided to use
the last means of protest

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.421
he thought he had left.

00:02:00.058 --> 00:02:05.708
He walked to the gates of that factory
with a bucket of petrol in his hands,

00:02:05.732 --> 00:02:07.787
intending to set himself on fire.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.908
Ravi is not alone in his desperation.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:16.712
The UN estimates that worldwide,

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:21.735
four billion people live
without basic access to justice.

00:02:22.596 --> 00:02:27.425
These people face grave threats
to their safety, their livelihoods,

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:28.614
their dignity.

00:02:29.455 --> 00:02:34.178
There are almost always laws on the books
that would protect these people,

00:02:34.202 --> 00:02:36.961
but they've often
never heard of those laws,

00:02:36.985 --> 00:02:40.271
and the systems that are supposed
to enforce those laws

00:02:40.295 --> 00:02:43.874
are corrupt or broken or both.

00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:51.284
We are living with a global
epidemic of injustice,

00:02:51.308 --> 00:02:53.172
but we've been choosing to ignore it.

00:02:54.522 --> 00:02:57.602
Right now, in Sierra Leone,

00:02:57.626 --> 00:03:00.228
in Cambodia, in Ethiopia,

00:03:00.252 --> 00:03:02.301
farmers are being cajoled

00:03:02.325 --> 00:03:07.087
into putting their thumbprints
on 50-year lease agreements,

00:03:07.111 --> 00:03:10.547
signing away all the land
they've ever known for a pittance

00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:13.015
without anybody even explaining the terms.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.533
Governments seem to think that's OK.

00:03:18.123 --> 00:03:20.751
Right now, in the United States,

00:03:20.775 --> 00:03:23.727
in India, in Slovenia,

00:03:23.751 --> 00:03:26.838
people like Ravi
are raising their children

00:03:26.862 --> 00:03:29.783
in the shadow of factories or mines

00:03:29.807 --> 00:03:32.180
that are poisoning
their air and their water.

00:03:33.121 --> 00:03:36.030
There are environmental laws
that would protect these people,

00:03:36.054 --> 00:03:37.770
but many have never seen those laws,

00:03:37.794 --> 00:03:40.016
let alone having a shot at enforcing them.

00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:43.817
And the world seems
to have decided that's OK.

00:03:45.234 --> 00:03:46.987
What would it take to change that?

00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:52.663
Law is supposed to be the language we use

00:03:52.687 --> 00:03:55.531
to translate our dreams about justice

00:03:55.555 --> 00:03:58.837
into living institutions
that hold us together.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.753
Law is supposed to be the difference

00:04:01.777 --> 00:04:04.602
between a society
ruled by the most powerful

00:04:04.626 --> 00:04:07.110
and one that honors
the dignity of everyone,

00:04:07.134 --> 00:04:08.522
strong or weak.

00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:11.865
That's why I told
my grandmother 20 years ago

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.610
that I wanted to go to law school.

00:04:14.482 --> 00:04:16.816
Grandma didn't pause.
She didn't skip a beat.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.759
She said to me, "Lawyer is liar."

00:04:20.744 --> 00:04:23.735
(Laughter)

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.902
That was discouraging.

00:04:25.926 --> 00:04:29.219
(Laughter)

00:04:29.243 --> 00:04:30.905
But grandma's right, in a way.

00:04:30.929 --> 00:04:34.286
Something about law
and lawyers has gone wrong.

00:04:35.194 --> 00:04:39.249
We lawyers are usually
expensive, first of all,

00:04:39.273 --> 00:04:42.074
and we tend to focus
on formal court channels

00:04:42.098 --> 00:04:45.519
that are impractical
for many of the problems people face.

00:04:46.474 --> 00:04:51.727
Worse, our profession has shrouded law
in a cloak of complexity.

00:04:52.528 --> 00:04:55.425
Law is like riot gear on a police officer.

00:04:55.804 --> 00:04:59.188
It's intimidating and impenetrable,

00:04:59.212 --> 00:05:01.902
and it's hard to tell
there's something human underneath.

00:05:02.856 --> 00:05:07.022
If we're going to make justice
a reality for everyone,

00:05:07.046 --> 00:05:11.062
we need to turn law
from an abstraction or a threat

00:05:11.086 --> 00:05:16.879
into something that every single person
can understand, use and shape.

00:05:18.376 --> 00:05:22.128
Lawyers are crucial
in that fight, no doubt,

00:05:22.152 --> 00:05:24.082
but we can't leave it to lawyers alone.

00:05:25.147 --> 00:05:27.448
In health care, for example,

00:05:27.472 --> 00:05:30.825
we don't just rely
on doctors to serve patients.

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.055
We have nurses and midwives
and community health workers.

00:05:35.925 --> 00:05:38.830
The same should be true of justice.

00:05:39.767 --> 00:05:41.791
Community legal workers,

00:05:41.815 --> 00:05:44.220
sometimes we call them
community paralegals,

00:05:44.244 --> 00:05:46.368
or barefoot lawyers,

00:05:46.392 --> 00:05:47.602
can be a bridge.

00:05:48.095 --> 00:05:50.912
These paralegals are from
the communities they serve.

00:05:51.577 --> 00:05:53.377
They demystify law,

00:05:53.401 --> 00:05:55.613
break it down into simple terms,

00:05:55.637 --> 00:05:58.319
and then they help people
look for a solution.

00:05:59.142 --> 00:06:00.905
They don't focus on the courts alone.

00:06:00.929 --> 00:06:02.632
They look everywhere:

00:06:02.656 --> 00:06:06.775
ministry departments,
local government, an ombudsman's office.

00:06:07.933 --> 00:06:10.512
Lawyers sometimes say to their clients,

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:12.488
"I'll handle it for you. I've got you."

00:06:12.883 --> 00:06:15.352
Paralegals have a different message,

00:06:15.376 --> 00:06:18.017
not "I'm going to solve it for you,"

00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:20.293
but "We're going to solve it together,

00:06:20.317 --> 00:06:22.682
and in the process,
we're both going to grow."

00:06:23.957 --> 00:06:27.972
Community paralegals
saved my own relationship to law.

00:06:28.377 --> 00:06:31.080
After about a year in law school,
I almost dropped out.

00:06:31.104 --> 00:06:34.235
I was thinking maybe I should
have listened to my grandmother.

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:36.839
It was when I started
working with paralegals

00:06:36.863 --> 00:06:39.642
in Sierra Leone, in 2003,

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:43.392
that I began feeling hopeful
about the law again,

00:06:43.416 --> 00:06:45.919
and I have been obsessed ever since.

00:06:47.158 --> 00:06:48.554
Let me come back to Ravi.

00:06:50.173 --> 00:06:54.331
2013, he did reach
the gates of that factory

00:06:54.355 --> 00:06:56.872
with the bucket of petrol in his hands,

00:06:56.896 --> 00:06:59.507
but he was arrested
before he could follow through.

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:02.265
He didn't have to spend long in jail,

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:04.971
but he felt completely defeated.

00:07:05.962 --> 00:07:09.136
Then, two years later, he met someone.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.879
I'm going to call him Kush.

00:07:10.903 --> 00:07:14.303
Kush is part of a team
of community paralegals

00:07:14.327 --> 00:07:17.485
that works for environmental justice
on the Gujarat coast.

00:07:18.144 --> 00:07:22.040
Kush explained to Ravi
that there was law on his side.

00:07:22.762 --> 00:07:26.449
Kush translated into Gujarati
something Ravi had never seen.

00:07:26.473 --> 00:07:28.484
It's called the "consent to operate."

00:07:28.508 --> 00:07:30.405
It's issued by the state government,

00:07:30.429 --> 00:07:32.457
and it allows the factory to run

00:07:32.481 --> 00:07:35.777
only if it complies
with specific conditions.

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:40.627
So together, they compared
the legal requirements with reality,

00:07:40.651 --> 00:07:42.278
they collected evidence,

00:07:42.302 --> 00:07:44.183
and they drafted an application --

00:07:44.207 --> 00:07:48.893
not to the courts,
but to two administrative institutions,

00:07:48.917 --> 00:07:51.904
the Pollution Control Board
and the district administration.

00:07:52.945 --> 00:07:57.977
Those applications started turning
the creaky wheels of enforcement.

00:07:59.096 --> 00:08:02.541
A pollution officer
came for a site inspection,

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:06.894
and after that, the company
started running an air filtration system

00:08:06.918 --> 00:08:09.084
it was supposed to have
been using all along.

00:08:10.121 --> 00:08:13.398
It also started covering the 100 trucks

00:08:13.422 --> 00:08:16.064
that come and go
from that plant every day.

00:08:17.447 --> 00:08:21.129
Those two measures
reduced the air pollution considerably.

00:08:22.144 --> 00:08:24.122
The case is far from over,

00:08:24.146 --> 00:08:28.463
but learning and using law gave Ravi hope.

00:08:30.318 --> 00:08:36.210
There are people like Kush
walking alongside people like Ravi

00:08:36.235 --> 00:08:37.719
in many places.

00:08:37.743 --> 00:08:40.032
Today, I work with a group called Namati.

00:08:40.056 --> 00:08:43.088
Namati helps convene a global network

00:08:43.112 --> 00:08:44.785
dedicated to legal empowerment.

00:08:45.434 --> 00:08:48.389
All together, we are over
a thousand organizations

00:08:48.413 --> 00:08:49.777
in 120 countries.

00:08:50.224 --> 00:08:54.097
Collectively, we deploy
tens of thousands of community paralegals.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.383
Let me give you another example.

00:08:58.544 --> 00:09:00.345
This is Khadija Hamsa.

00:09:01.011 --> 00:09:07.577
She is one of five million people in Kenya
who faces a discriminatory vetting process

00:09:07.601 --> 00:09:10.393
when trying to obtain a national ID card.

00:09:10.965 --> 00:09:14.824
It is like the Jim Crow South
in the United States.

00:09:14.848 --> 00:09:17.243
If you are from a certain set of tribes,

00:09:17.267 --> 00:09:18.515
most of them Muslim,

00:09:18.539 --> 00:09:20.951
you get sent to a different line.

00:09:21.915 --> 00:09:24.475
Without an ID, you can't apply for a job.

00:09:24.826 --> 00:09:26.456
You can't get a bank loan.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.059
You can't enroll in university.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.067
You are excluded from society.

00:09:32.066 --> 00:09:36.216
Khadija tried off and on to get an ID
for eight years, without success.

00:09:37.415 --> 00:09:40.749
Then she met a paralegal
working in her community

00:09:40.773 --> 00:09:42.200
named Hassan Kassim.

00:09:42.992 --> 00:09:46.166
Hassan explained to Khadija
how vetting works,

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:48.333
he helped her gather
the documents she needed,

00:09:48.357 --> 00:09:51.048
helped prep her to go before
the vetting committee.

00:09:51.072 --> 00:09:54.072
Finally, she was able to get an ID
with Hassan's help.

00:09:55.405 --> 00:09:57.214
First thing she did with it

00:09:57.238 --> 00:10:00.730
was use it to apply
for birth certificates for her children,

00:10:00.754 --> 00:10:02.888
which they need in order to go to school.

00:10:05.593 --> 00:10:09.294
In the United States,
among many other problems,

00:10:09.318 --> 00:10:13.182
we have a housing crisis.

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:14.855
In many cities,

00:10:14.879 --> 00:10:19.079
90 percent of the landlords
in housing court have attorneys,

00:10:19.103 --> 00:10:21.983
while 90 percent of the tenants do not.

00:10:22.434 --> 00:10:25.292
In New York, a new crew of paralegals --

00:10:25.316 --> 00:10:27.789
they're called
Access to Justice Navigators --

00:10:27.813 --> 00:10:31.770
helps people to understand housing law
and to advocate for themselves.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.028
Normally in New York,

00:10:34.052 --> 00:10:37.583
one out of nine tenants
brought to housing court

00:10:37.607 --> 00:10:38.877
gets evicted.

00:10:39.666 --> 00:10:42.246
Researchers took a look at 150 cases

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.944
in which people had help
from these paralegals,

00:10:44.968 --> 00:10:48.088
and they found no evictions at all,

00:10:48.112 --> 00:10:49.262
not one.

00:10:49.966 --> 00:10:52.934
A little bit of legal empowerment
can go a long way.

00:10:53.831 --> 00:10:58.354
I see the beginnings of a real movement,

00:10:58.378 --> 00:11:00.505
but we're nowhere near what's necessary.

00:11:01.208 --> 00:11:02.358
Not yet.

00:11:02.889 --> 00:11:04.615
In most countries around the world,

00:11:04.639 --> 00:11:07.875
governments do not provide
a single dollar of support

00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:10.270
to paralegals like Hassan and Kush.

00:11:11.001 --> 00:11:14.794
Most governments don't even recognize
the role paralegals play,

00:11:14.818 --> 00:11:16.532
or protect paralegals from harm.

00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:19.822
I also don't want
to give you the impression

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:22.830
that paralegals and their clients
win every time.

00:11:23.957 --> 00:11:25.123
Not at all.

00:11:25.147 --> 00:11:27.933
That cement factory behind Ravi's village,

00:11:27.957 --> 00:11:31.331
it's been turning off
the filtration system at night,

00:11:31.355 --> 00:11:34.609
when it's least likely
that the company would get caught.

00:11:34.633 --> 00:11:36.339
Running that filter costs money.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:40.651
Ravi WhatsApps photos
of the polluted night sky.

00:11:40.976 --> 00:11:43.103
This is one he sent to Kush in May.

00:11:44.706 --> 00:11:47.642
Ravi says the air is still unbreathable.

00:11:48.465 --> 00:11:51.126
At one point this year,
Ravi went on hunger strike.

00:11:51.806 --> 00:11:53.414
Kush was frustrated.

00:11:53.438 --> 00:11:55.473
He said, "We can win if we use the law."

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:59.023
Ravi said, "I believe in the law, I do,

00:11:59.047 --> 00:12:00.976
but it's not getting us far enough."

00:12:02.778 --> 00:12:08.002
Whether it's India, Kenya,
the United States or anywhere else,

00:12:08.026 --> 00:12:11.355
trying to squeeze justice
out of broken systems

00:12:11.379 --> 00:12:13.070
is like Ravi's case.

00:12:13.422 --> 00:12:17.081
Hope and despair are neck and neck.

00:12:18.426 --> 00:12:22.259
And so not only do we urgently need
to support and protect

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:25.180
the work of barefoot lawyers
around the world,

00:12:25.204 --> 00:12:28.259
we need to change the systems themselves.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.474
Every case a paralegal takes on

00:12:32.498 --> 00:12:36.880
is a story about how a system
is working in practice.

00:12:37.793 --> 00:12:39.532
When you put those stories together,

00:12:39.556 --> 00:12:43.183
it gives you a detailed portrait
of the system as a whole.

00:12:43.207 --> 00:12:45.007
People can use that information

00:12:45.031 --> 00:12:47.865
to demand improvements
to laws and policies.

00:12:48.867 --> 00:12:53.233
In India, paralegals and clients
have drawn on their case experience

00:12:53.257 --> 00:12:57.025
to propose smarter regulations
for the handling of minerals.

00:12:57.836 --> 00:13:02.582
In Kenya, paralegals and clients
are using data from thousands of cases

00:13:02.606 --> 00:13:05.630
to argue that vetting is unconstitutional.

00:13:07.852 --> 00:13:10.345
This is a different way
of approaching reform.

00:13:10.369 --> 00:13:13.647
This is not a consultant
flying into Myanmar

00:13:13.671 --> 00:13:17.059
with a template he's going
to cut and paste from Macedonia,

00:13:17.083 --> 00:13:20.059
and this is not an angry tweet.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.963
This is about growing reforms
from the experience of ordinary people

00:13:24.987 --> 00:13:27.689
trying to make the rules and systems work.

00:13:29.154 --> 00:13:35.756
This transformation in the relationship
between people and law

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.287
is the right thing to do.

00:13:38.748 --> 00:13:41.853
It's also essential for overcoming

00:13:41.877 --> 00:13:45.359
all of the other
great challenges of our times.

00:13:46.995 --> 00:13:51.610
We are not going to avert
environmental collapse

00:13:51.634 --> 00:13:54.530
if the people most affected by pollution

00:13:54.554 --> 00:13:58.825
don't have a say in what happens
to the land and the water,

00:13:58.849 --> 00:14:03.498
and we won't succeed in reducing poverty
or expanding opportunity

00:14:03.522 --> 00:14:06.728
if poor people can't exercise
their basic rights.

00:14:07.879 --> 00:14:11.365
And I believe we won't overcome

00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:16.485
the despair that authoritarian
politicians prey upon

00:14:16.509 --> 00:14:18.874
if our systems stay rigged.

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:26.351
I called Ravi before coming here
to ask permission to share his story.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.164
I asked if there was any message
he wanted to give people.

00:14:31.566 --> 00:14:34.050
He said, "[Gujarati]."

00:14:35.193 --> 00:14:36.343
Wake up.

00:14:38.101 --> 00:14:40.475
"[Gujarati]."

00:14:40.499 --> 00:14:41.689
Don't be afraid.

00:14:42.699 --> 00:14:44.025
"[Gujarati]."

00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:45.670
Fight with paper.

00:14:45.694 --> 00:14:49.199
By that I think he means
fight using law rather than guns.

00:14:49.752 --> 00:14:55.205
"[Gujarati]."

00:14:55.229 --> 00:14:58.892
Maybe not today, maybe not this year,
maybe not in five years,

00:14:58.916 --> 00:15:01.201
but find justice.

00:15:04.035 --> 00:15:10.258
If this guy, whose entire community
is being poisoned every single day,

00:15:10.282 --> 00:15:12.870
who was ready to take his own life --

00:15:12.894 --> 00:15:15.854
if he's not giving up on seeking justice,

00:15:15.878 --> 00:15:17.848
then the world can't give up either.

00:15:19.159 --> 00:15:22.629
Ultimately, what Ravi calls
"fighting with paper"

00:15:22.653 --> 00:15:27.143
is about forging a deeper
version of democracy

00:15:27.167 --> 00:15:28.458
in which we the people,

00:15:28.482 --> 00:15:30.846
we don't just cast ballots
every few years,

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:37.215
we take part daily in the rules
and institutions that hold us together,

00:15:37.239 --> 00:15:40.739
in which everyone,
even the least powerful,

00:15:40.763 --> 00:15:44.342
can know law, use law and shape law.

00:15:45.405 --> 00:15:48.502
Making that happen, winning that fight,

00:15:48.526 --> 00:15:49.835
requires all of us.

00:15:50.357 --> 00:15:52.086
Thank you guys. Thank you.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:58.669
(Applause)

00:16:01.166 --> 00:16:03.079
Kelo Kubu: Thanks, Vivek.

00:16:03.103 --> 00:16:06.237
So I'm going to make a few assumptions

00:16:06.261 --> 00:16:09.839
that people in this room know
what the Sustainable Development Goals are

00:16:09.863 --> 00:16:12.591
and how the process works,

00:16:12.615 --> 00:16:15.457
but I want us to talk a little bit

00:16:15.481 --> 00:16:19.916
about Goal 16: Peace, justice
and strong institutions.

00:16:20.512 --> 00:16:24.204
Vivek Maru: Yeah. Anybody remember
the Millennium Development Goals?

00:16:24.228 --> 00:16:29.342
They were adopted in 2000 by the UN
and governments around the world,

00:16:29.366 --> 00:16:31.462
and they were for essential,
laudable things.

00:16:31.486 --> 00:16:35.080
It was reduce child mortality
by two thirds, cut hunger in half,

00:16:35.104 --> 00:16:36.293
crucial things.

00:16:36.317 --> 00:16:39.343
But there was no mention
of justice or fairness

00:16:39.367 --> 00:16:41.689
or accountability or corruption,

00:16:41.713 --> 00:16:44.427
and we have made progress
during the 15 years

00:16:44.451 --> 00:16:46.347
when those goals were in effect,

00:16:46.371 --> 00:16:49.277
but we are way behind
what justice demands,

00:16:49.301 --> 00:16:52.769
and we're not going to get there
unless we take justice into account.

00:16:53.309 --> 00:16:56.911
And so when the debate started
about the next development framework,

00:16:56.935 --> 00:16:59.771
the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals,

00:16:59.795 --> 00:17:02.307
our community came together
around the world

00:17:02.331 --> 00:17:06.194
to argue that access to justice
and legal empowerment

00:17:06.218 --> 00:17:08.297
should be a part of that new framework.

00:17:08.321 --> 00:17:10.313
And there was a lot of resistance.

00:17:10.337 --> 00:17:13.709
Those things are more political,
more contentious than the other ones,

00:17:13.733 --> 00:17:17.406
so we didn't know until the night before
whether it was going to come through.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:18.594
We squeaked by.

00:17:18.618 --> 00:17:22.814
The 16th out of 17 goals
commits to access to justice for all,

00:17:22.838 --> 00:17:23.988
which is a big deal.

00:17:24.581 --> 00:17:27.828
It's a big deal, yes.
Let's clap for justice.

00:17:27.852 --> 00:17:29.598
(Applause)

00:17:29.622 --> 00:17:31.517
Here's the scandal, though.

00:17:31.541 --> 00:17:34.469
The day the goals were adopted,

00:17:34.493 --> 00:17:37.993
most of them were accompanied
by big commitments:

00:17:38.017 --> 00:17:40.088
a billion dollars
from the Gates Foundation

00:17:40.112 --> 00:17:42.088
and the British government for nutrition;

00:17:42.112 --> 00:17:46.223
25 billion in public-private financing
for health care for women and children.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.564
On access to justice,
we had the words on the paper,

00:17:49.588 --> 00:17:52.110
but nobody pledged a penny,

00:17:52.134 --> 00:17:56.014
and so that is the opportunity
and the challenge that we face right now.

00:17:56.038 --> 00:17:59.109
The world recognizes more than ever before

00:17:59.133 --> 00:18:01.997
that you can't have
development without justice,

00:18:02.021 --> 00:18:05.886
that people can't improve their lives
if they can't exercise their rights,

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:09.290
and what we need to do now
is turn that rhetoric,

00:18:09.314 --> 00:18:11.933
turn that principle, into reality.

00:18:12.964 --> 00:18:17.901
(Applause)

00:18:17.925 --> 00:18:20.532
KK: How can we help?
What can people in this room do?

00:18:20.556 --> 00:18:23.773
VM: Great question. Thank you for asking.

00:18:23.797 --> 00:18:25.354
I would say three things.

00:18:25.378 --> 00:18:27.087
One is invest.

00:18:27.111 --> 00:18:30.317
If you have 10 dollars,
or a hundred dollars, a million dollars,

00:18:30.341 --> 00:18:33.480
consider putting some of it
towards grassroots legal empowerment.

00:18:33.504 --> 00:18:35.010
It's important in its own right

00:18:35.034 --> 00:18:38.409
and it's crucial for just about
everything else we care about.

00:18:38.433 --> 00:18:39.670
Number two,

00:18:39.694 --> 00:18:44.686
push your politicians and your governments
to make this a public priority.

00:18:45.905 --> 00:18:48.476
Just like health or education,
access to justice

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.866
should be one of the things
that a government owes its people,

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:53.557
and we're nowhere close to that,

00:18:53.581 --> 00:18:55.961
neither in rich countries
or poor countries.

00:18:55.985 --> 00:18:59.731
Number three is:
be a paralegal in your own life.

00:19:00.596 --> 00:19:03.389
Find an injustice
or a problem where you live.

00:19:03.413 --> 00:19:05.087
It's not hard to find, if you look.

00:19:05.111 --> 00:19:06.739
Is the river being contaminated,

00:19:06.763 --> 00:19:09.212
the one that passes through
the city where you live?

00:19:09.236 --> 00:19:11.739
Are there workers getting paid
less than minimum wage

00:19:11.763 --> 00:19:13.653
or who are working without safety gear?

00:19:13.677 --> 00:19:16.194
Get to know the people most affected,

00:19:16.218 --> 00:19:17.838
find out what the rules say,

00:19:17.862 --> 00:19:21.055
see if you can use those rules
to get a solution.

00:19:21.587 --> 00:19:25.405
If it doesn't work, see if you can
come together to improve those rules.

00:19:25.429 --> 00:19:31.492
Because if we all start knowing law,
using law and shaping law,

00:19:31.516 --> 00:19:34.777
then we will be building
that deeper version of democracy

00:19:34.801 --> 00:19:37.476
that I believe our world
desperately needs.

00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:40.030
(Applause)

00:19:40.054 --> 00:19:42.293
KK: Thanks so much, Vivek.
VM: Thank you.
