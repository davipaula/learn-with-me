00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.893
In 2015, we saw two fantastic,
hopeful breakthroughs for humanity.

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:21.115
First, the adoption of
the Sustainable Development Goals,

00:00:21.139 --> 00:00:24.133
the collective, universal
plan for humanity

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:25.461
to eradicate hunger,

00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:27.961
[promote] good economic
development and good health,

00:00:27.985 --> 00:00:29.723
within global environmental targets.

00:00:29.747 --> 00:00:32.616
Secondly, after 21 years of negotiations,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.690
we adopted the legally binding
Paris Agreement,

00:00:35.714 --> 00:00:39.267
all nations in the world keeping
global warming under two degrees Celsius,

00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:41.552
aiming at 1.5 degrees Celsius.

00:00:41.576 --> 00:00:47.113
Today, three years down the line,
we're still in the hand-waving business.

00:00:47.745 --> 00:00:50.370
Now, I think it's time
to step back one step

00:00:50.394 --> 00:00:54.880
and recognize that I wonder if the world
leaders really knew what they signed

00:00:54.904 --> 00:00:57.018
at the General Assembly three years ago.

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.902
These are universal, aspirational,
transformational goals

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:05.885
for inclusive, prosperous humanity
on a stable earth system.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.940
But there are underlying problems.

00:01:07.964 --> 00:01:11.169
We have inherent contradictions
between these goals,

00:01:11.193 --> 00:01:16.061
where there's the risk of pursuing
one favored goal at the expense of others.

00:01:16.084 --> 00:01:19.420
Take, for example, Goal 8,
on decent work and economic growth.

00:01:19.444 --> 00:01:22.140
If we continue doing that
by exploiting natural resources

00:01:22.164 --> 00:01:23.380
and burning fossil fuels,

00:01:23.404 --> 00:01:26.442
it will be impossible to reach Goal 13.

00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:28.982
Three years down the line,
we simply must admit

00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:33.163
we're seeing limited action
to really, really address this

00:01:33.187 --> 00:01:36.559
as an inclusive, collective,
universal package.

00:01:37.143 --> 00:01:40.462
Now, this requires us
to step back one step.

00:01:40.486 --> 00:01:43.172
I think we have to ask ourselves
some hard questions:

00:01:43.196 --> 00:01:48.174
Do we have any chance of accomplishing
the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.927
Are there actually inherent trade-offs

00:01:50.951 --> 00:01:55.345
that are not compatible
with our current development paradigm?

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.812
But are there, perhaps, synergies
where we can really accelerate change?

00:01:58.836 --> 00:02:01.008
And is it really a people-planet agenda,

00:02:01.032 --> 00:02:06.600
really taking seriously
the social and economic aspirational goals

00:02:06.624 --> 00:02:09.963
within the life-support systems on earth?

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:13.512
Now, citizens across the world
have started to recognize

00:02:13.536 --> 00:02:16.583
that we're facing global
rising environmental risks;

00:02:16.607 --> 00:02:19.564
in fact, that a stable planet
is a prerequisite

00:02:19.588 --> 00:02:22.618
to have good human well-being on earth.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:27.119
We need to define a safe operating space
on a stable earth system,

00:02:27.143 --> 00:02:29.997
and the planetary boundary
framework was introduced

00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:32.122
by the scientific community in 2009

00:02:32.146 --> 00:02:33.964
to do exactly that.

00:02:34.393 --> 00:02:37.259
It has now been widely embraced
across the world

00:02:37.283 --> 00:02:39.634
in policy, business and communities

00:02:39.658 --> 00:02:41.988
as a framework for sustainable development

00:02:42.012 --> 00:02:43.363
in the Anthropocene.

00:02:43.387 --> 00:02:49.435
This slide really shows the framework
with the nine environmental processes

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.775
that regulate the stability
of the earth system,

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.601
providing a safe operating space,

00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:57.032
where we'll have a high chance
of having good human well-being

00:02:57.056 --> 00:02:58.563
and prosperity and equity.

00:02:58.587 --> 00:03:02.938
If we move into the yellow zone,
we enter a dangerous uncertainty zone;

00:03:02.962 --> 00:03:06.419
and into the red, we have a high
likelihood of crossing tipping points

00:03:06.443 --> 00:03:10.491
that could take us irreversibly away
from the ability of the earth system

00:03:10.515 --> 00:03:14.455
to provide social and economic
well-being for humanity.

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:20.113
Now, we can today, scientifically,
quantify these boundaries,

00:03:20.137 --> 00:03:23.715
providing us a stable
earth system for humanity.

00:03:24.192 --> 00:03:25.925
But we have to go beyond this

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.287
and recognize the Sustainable
Development Goals --

00:03:28.311 --> 00:03:30.648
if we really want
to seriously accomplish them --

00:03:30.658 --> 00:03:33.898
must now occur within
this safe operating space.

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:37.442
We need to achieve SDGs within PBs.

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.121
But dear friends, not even this is enough.

00:03:41.145 --> 00:03:43.955
We need to recognize
that the Sustainable Development Goals

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:45.471
is 12 years away.

00:03:45.495 --> 00:03:47.183
It's only a milestone.

00:03:47.207 --> 00:03:50.161
It is the bull's-eye
that we need to go through

00:03:50.185 --> 00:03:53.084
and zoom ourselves towards transformations

00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:56.834
where we can have a good future
for all co-citizens on earth,

00:03:56.858 --> 00:03:58.123
nine billion plus,

00:03:58.147 --> 00:04:01.749
within a stable earth system
in 2050 and beyond.

00:04:02.405 --> 00:04:04.189
This is a quest,

00:04:04.213 --> 00:04:07.751
and in order to really explore this
and not have only opinions about it,

00:04:07.775 --> 00:04:11.087
we gathered the scientific community,
the best thinkers and modelers

00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:14.933
and started to develop a completely
new complex systems dynamic model,

00:04:14.957 --> 00:04:16.123
the Earth-3 model,

00:04:16.147 --> 00:04:20.374
building on models that have been around
for the last 50 years.

00:04:20.815 --> 00:04:22.965
And here it is.

00:04:22.989 --> 00:04:25.101
This is a fantastic piece of work.

00:04:25.125 --> 00:04:29.228
This has a climate module, a biosphere
module, a global economic model;

00:04:29.252 --> 00:04:34.342
it has algorithms, it has the whole room
of fantastic accomplishments.

00:04:34.366 --> 00:04:36.527
This is what turns us scientists on.

00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:37.613
(Laughter)

00:04:37.637 --> 00:04:39.860
I mean, this is just
a beautiful piece of work?

00:04:39.884 --> 00:04:43.690
And I'd just love to spend the whole
evening walking this through with you,

00:04:43.714 --> 00:04:45.658
but I'll make you disappointed.

00:04:45.682 --> 00:04:47.252
I cannot do that.

00:04:47.276 --> 00:04:50.491
In fact, the only thing I can do with you
is just to assure you

00:04:50.515 --> 00:04:52.762
that this is the first time it's done.

00:04:52.786 --> 00:04:55.793
Nobody has ever tried
to really analytically combine

00:04:55.817 --> 00:04:58.680
the Sustainable Development Goals
with planetary boundaries.

00:04:58.704 --> 00:05:04.073
And we were able to find patterns
and really convergent trends

00:05:04.097 --> 00:05:08.066
that gives us a lot of confidence
in our ability to now project

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.411
economic development,

00:05:09.435 --> 00:05:12.489
resources use from water, food and energy,

00:05:12.513 --> 00:05:14.864
population growth, income per person,

00:05:14.888 --> 00:05:18.659
yet along these consistent
and systemic pathways.

00:05:18.683 --> 00:05:21.505
So, it's the first time we have
a robust opportunity

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:26.514
to really explore the futures of ability
of attaining the SDGs within PBs.

00:05:26.538 --> 00:05:27.722
Now, how do we do this?

00:05:27.746 --> 00:05:28.902
Well, look at this.

00:05:28.926 --> 00:05:32.151
Here, you have the data
coming from the real world,

00:05:32.175 --> 00:05:34.779
calibrated from 1970-2015:

00:05:34.803 --> 00:05:37.446
100,000 data points around the world,

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.026
building on seven regions' ability,

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.039
of really picking on all these
Sustainable Development Goals.

00:05:43.063 --> 00:05:45.075
Now, one example of how
we calibrated this,

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:47.856
here you have [data] for
Sustainable Development Goals

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.417
on eradicating poverty, health,
education and food.

00:05:51.441 --> 00:05:55.412
And here you have in the bubbles
the seven regions of the world,

00:05:55.436 --> 00:05:59.863
how they move up until 2015
in our empirical observations

00:05:59.887 --> 00:06:02.064
in relation to GDP per capita,

00:06:02.088 --> 00:06:04.669
giving these universal convergent trends,

00:06:04.693 --> 00:06:07.778
which enabled us to create regressions

00:06:07.802 --> 00:06:11.457
that could make us able to do
simulations into the future,

00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:13.438
all the way until 2050,

00:06:13.462 --> 00:06:18.277
showing the ability along
the lines here to attain the SDGs.

00:06:18.734 --> 00:06:23.367
Now, this gave us the opportunity
of doing several scenarios,

00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:25.906
testing different possible futures:

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.485
business as usual, global transformations,

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:31.878
investment schemes in business,
different governance options,

00:06:31.902 --> 00:06:34.175
policies, finance --

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.345
really, to explore what
the future can look like

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:40.274
in our ability to attain
the SDGs within PBs.

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:43.762
And the results, I can tell you,
really surprised us.

00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:45.844
And this will be
the first time it's shown.

00:06:45.868 --> 00:06:49.021
It should actually not even
be referenced outside of this room.

00:06:49.045 --> 00:06:52.829
Now, it actually is presented
along two axes.

00:06:52.853 --> 00:06:56.807
The y-axis here shows our ability
to stay within planetary boundaries.

00:06:56.831 --> 00:07:00.608
The higher up, the closer you are
to the safe operating space.

00:07:00.632 --> 00:07:03.154
On the x-axis are
the Sustainable Development Goals;

00:07:03.178 --> 00:07:06.303
the further to the right,
the more of the SDGs we fulfill.

00:07:06.327 --> 00:07:08.745
We all want to be in
the upper right-hand corner,

00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:11.784
the safe and just world for the future.

00:07:11.808 --> 00:07:14.285
Now, the point you see there is 1980.

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:17.783
We were in a situation where we actually
were in a safe operating space

00:07:17.807 --> 00:07:19.911
but not meeting so many of the SDGs.

00:07:19.935 --> 00:07:22.907
Here's the trend up until 2015.

00:07:22.931 --> 00:07:24.757
So this is the conventional world,

00:07:24.781 --> 00:07:27.896
which is actually delivering
on an increasing number of SDGs,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.128
lifting millions of people out of poverty,

00:07:30.152 --> 00:07:34.845
but doing it at the expense
of the safe operating space on earth.

00:07:35.327 --> 00:07:38.852
Now, this is the scenario
business as usual, into the future.

00:07:38.876 --> 00:07:40.730
If we just move on as today,

00:07:40.754 --> 00:07:43.521
we will be able to deliver
on some of the SDGs,

00:07:43.545 --> 00:07:47.357
but we'll do it at the expense
of the stability of the earth system.

00:07:48.061 --> 00:07:50.775
Now, what if we go faster
on economic growth

00:07:50.799 --> 00:07:55.723
and really ally on one percent
increase per year of income

00:07:55.747 --> 00:07:59.107
and an even tripling
of the world economy by 2050?

00:07:59.131 --> 00:08:01.347
That would give us
the following trajectory.

00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:05.190
We would, yes, go a little bit further
on SDG accomplishments,

00:08:05.214 --> 00:08:09.508
but still at the expense of the risk
of destabilizing the planet.

00:08:10.119 --> 00:08:12.119
But what if we really go harder?

00:08:12.143 --> 00:08:16.844
What if we increase our ability
to deliver on our promises by 30 percent

00:08:16.868 --> 00:08:19.510
across all sectors in society,

00:08:19.534 --> 00:08:22.777
from climate to our trade agreements?

00:08:23.188 --> 00:08:27.428
A harder scenario would take us
a little bit better,

00:08:27.452 --> 00:08:30.423
but still, we're failing on the SDGs,

00:08:30.447 --> 00:08:34.434
and we are not accomplishing
a safe operating space for humanity.

00:08:34.458 --> 00:08:38.984
So this really led us to a quite
disappointing conclusion,

00:08:39.008 --> 00:08:44.457
that we will actually, even if we go
conventional futures, fail on the SDGs

00:08:44.481 --> 00:08:46.445
and transgress planetary boundaries.

00:08:46.469 --> 00:08:47.941
We need some radical thinking.

00:08:47.965 --> 00:08:52.037
We need to go into
a transformative, disruptive future,

00:08:52.061 --> 00:08:55.155
where we start thinking
outside of the box.

00:08:55.179 --> 00:08:58.524
The modeling and engagement
and dialogues enable us to identify

00:08:58.548 --> 00:09:02.530
five transformations that could
actually potentially take us there.

00:09:02.554 --> 00:09:05.772
The first one is to cut emissions
by half every decade

00:09:05.796 --> 00:09:08.062
along the scientific pathway to Paris,

00:09:08.086 --> 00:09:10.508
doubling investments in renewable energy,

00:09:10.532 --> 00:09:12.945
creating a global energy democracy,

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:15.619
allowing us to meet several of the SDGs.

00:09:16.157 --> 00:09:20.932
The second is a rapid shift
towards sustainable food systems,

00:09:20.956 --> 00:09:24.828
investing one percent per year
in sustainable intensification

00:09:24.852 --> 00:09:27.971
and really moving towards implementing
and investing in solutions

00:09:27.995 --> 00:09:30.668
that we already have available today.

00:09:31.286 --> 00:09:35.234
The third is really to shift
our development paradigm

00:09:35.258 --> 00:09:37.496
and learn from many
of the developing countries

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.779
that have moved very fast.

00:09:38.803 --> 00:09:42.152
What if we could have
an economic growth such as in China,

00:09:42.176 --> 00:09:45.199
while doing it within
the environmental parameters

00:09:45.223 --> 00:09:47.373
of an ecological civilization?

00:09:47.889 --> 00:09:50.511
Fourth, a redistribution of wealth.

00:09:50.535 --> 00:09:53.613
What if we could [agree]
that the richest 10 percent

00:09:53.637 --> 00:09:56.877
could not allow themselves to amass
more than 40 percent, maximum,

00:09:56.901 --> 00:09:58.066
of national incomes --

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.222
a drastic redistribution of wealth,

00:10:00.246 --> 00:10:03.820
reforming the ability
of equity across regions?

00:10:03.844 --> 00:10:07.639
And finally, fifth, a radical increase
in more education, health,

00:10:07.663 --> 00:10:09.196
access to work, contraception,

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:12.505
investing largely in women
across the world,

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:17.505
allowing us to deliver on SDGs
on gender, inequality,

00:10:17.529 --> 00:10:20.014
economics and urban development.

00:10:20.038 --> 00:10:23.921
Now, if we would push ourselves
across all these five --

00:10:23.945 --> 00:10:29.088
we tested this, and it would give us
an amazing journey

00:10:29.112 --> 00:10:32.819
towards the safe and just
operating space on earth.

00:10:33.445 --> 00:10:37.652
It shows us that even with
a conservative, empirically based,

00:10:37.676 --> 00:10:39.448
complex system dynamics model,

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:43.463
we are at a state where we can
actually think of transformations

00:10:43.487 --> 00:10:45.403
over the next 12 years and beyond

00:10:45.427 --> 00:10:48.632
that can take us up into
the safe operating space

00:10:48.656 --> 00:10:52.126
and deliver on aspirational
social and economic goals.

00:10:52.598 --> 00:10:55.299
This is actually quite uplifting,

00:10:55.323 --> 00:10:58.632
despite the fact that we're
not moving along this trajectory.

00:10:58.656 --> 00:11:00.063
So, in summary:

00:11:00.087 --> 00:11:04.248
we now, three years into
the operational delivery on the SDGs,

00:11:04.272 --> 00:11:06.379
must draw a line

00:11:06.403 --> 00:11:09.875
and conclude that we're not
delivering on our promises,

00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:12.371
and not only that, we're running the risks

00:11:12.395 --> 00:11:15.722
of future generations having
an even tougher ability,

00:11:15.746 --> 00:11:19.389
because of the risk of pushing
the earth system beyond tipping points.

00:11:19.413 --> 00:11:23.230
In fact, we are facing even
a risk of a hothouse earth,

00:11:23.254 --> 00:11:26.865
where we will undermine
and create geopolitical instabilities

00:11:26.889 --> 00:11:29.208
that could actually make life
even more tough

00:11:29.232 --> 00:11:31.646
for billions of people on earth.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.307
This, in all honesty,
really, really scares me.

00:11:35.998 --> 00:11:38.576
But that's also why
I'm standing here tonight,

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.718
because the window
of success is still open.

00:11:41.742 --> 00:11:44.183
The earth system is still resilient.

00:11:44.207 --> 00:11:48.038
She is still providing us
with ecosystem services and functions

00:11:48.062 --> 00:11:51.432
that can allow us a transition
back into a safe operating space.

00:11:51.456 --> 00:11:54.018
But we need radically different thinking.

00:11:54.042 --> 00:11:58.005
We need to see this
as an incredible wake-up call

00:11:58.029 --> 00:12:00.784
but also an opportunity
for transformative change,

00:12:00.808 --> 00:12:02.108
where we shift gears

00:12:02.132 --> 00:12:05.583
and really start thinking
of the SDGs as a transformative agenda

00:12:05.607 --> 00:12:07.912
within a safe operating space on earth.

00:12:07.936 --> 00:12:12.168
In other words, we can build
a safe and just world.

00:12:12.192 --> 00:12:15.198
We just have to really,
really get on with it.

00:12:15.222 --> 00:12:17.045
And let's do it. Thank you.

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:20.771
