00:00:00.026 --> 00:00:03.487
We're now becoming aware
of a significant relationship

00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:06.236
between sleep and Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:06.785 --> 00:00:09.066
[Sleeping with Science]

00:00:11.418 --> 00:00:15.253
Now, Alzheimer's disease
is a form of dementia

00:00:15.277 --> 00:00:19.483
typified usually by memory loss
and memory decline.

00:00:19.507 --> 00:00:21.443
And what we've started to understand

00:00:21.467 --> 00:00:24.435
is that there are several
different proteins

00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:27.625
that seem to go awry
in Alzheimer's disease.

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.980
One of those proteins
is a sticky, toxic substance

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:34.325
called beta-amyloid
that builds up in the brain.

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:37.220
The other is something called tau protein.

00:00:37.244 --> 00:00:40.251
How are these things related to sleep?

00:00:40.275 --> 00:00:44.716
Well first, if we look at a large-scale
epidemiological level,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.598
what we know is that individuals

00:00:46.622 --> 00:00:50.516
who report sleeping typically
less than six hours a night,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.645
have a significantly higher risk

00:00:52.669 --> 00:00:55.113
of going on to develop high amounts

00:00:55.137 --> 00:00:58.398
of that beta-amyloid
in their brain later in life.

00:00:58.422 --> 00:01:01.725
We also know that two sleep disorders,

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:06.117
including insomnia and sleep apnea,
or heavy snoring,

00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:09.212
are associated with
a significantly higher risk

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:12.186
of Alzheimer's disease in late life.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.979
Those are, of course,
simply associational studies.

00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:17.781
They don't prove causality.

00:01:17.805 --> 00:01:19.209
But more recently,

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:23.376
we actually have identified
that causal evidence.

00:01:23.755 --> 00:01:26.574
In fact, if you take a healthy human being

00:01:26.598 --> 00:01:29.555
and you deprive them
of sleep for just one night,

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.285
and the next day,
we see an immediate increase

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:34.928
in that beta-amyloid,

00:01:34.952 --> 00:01:37.167
both circulating in their bloodstream,

00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:40.945
circulating in what we call
the cerebrospinal fluid,

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:43.794
and most recently,
after just one night of sleep,

00:01:43.818 --> 00:01:46.545
using special brain-imaging technology,

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:49.767
scientists have found
that there is an immediate increase

00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:53.299
in beta-amyloid
directly in the brain itself.

00:01:53.323 --> 00:01:55.734
So that's the causal evidence.

00:01:55.758 --> 00:01:57.856
What is it then about sleep

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.261
that seems to provide a mechanism

00:02:00.285 --> 00:02:02.626
that prevents the escalation

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.395
of these Alzheimer's-related proteins?

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.363
Well, several years ago,

00:02:07.387 --> 00:02:10.069
a scientist called Maiken Nedergaard

00:02:10.093 --> 00:02:12.553
made a remarkable discovery.

00:02:12.577 --> 00:02:17.348
What she identified
was a cleansing system in the brain.

00:02:17.678 --> 00:02:18.854
Now, before that,

00:02:18.878 --> 00:02:21.657
we knew that the body
had a cleansing system

00:02:21.681 --> 00:02:23.956
and many of you may be familiar with this.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.034
It's called the lymphatic system.

00:02:26.058 --> 00:02:29.915
But we didn't think that the brain
had its own cleansing system.

00:02:30.344 --> 00:02:31.906
And studying mice,

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.171
she was actually able to identify
a sewage system within the brain

00:02:37.195 --> 00:02:39.546
called the glymphatic system,

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.037
named after the cells that make it up,

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:43.762
called these glial cells.

00:02:43.786 --> 00:02:45.898
Now, if that wasn't remarkable enough,

00:02:45.922 --> 00:02:49.406
she went on to make
two more incredible discoveries.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.641
First, what she found is that
that cleansing system in the brain

00:02:53.665 --> 00:02:58.307
is not always switched on
in high-flow volume

00:02:58.331 --> 00:03:00.531
across the 24-hour period.

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:04.126
Instead, it was when those mice
were actually sleeping,

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.189
particularly when they went
into deep non-REM sleep,

00:03:07.213 --> 00:03:10.918
that that cleansing system
kicked into high gear.

00:03:10.942 --> 00:03:13.816
The third component that she discovered,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.506
and this is what makes it relevant

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.272
to our discussion on Alzheimer's disease,

00:03:18.296 --> 00:03:21.599
is that one of the metabolic by-products,

00:03:21.623 --> 00:03:25.487
one of the toxins
that was cleared away during sleep,

00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:29.424
was that sticky,
toxic protein, beta-amyloid,

00:03:29.448 --> 00:03:31.591
linked to Alzheimer's disease.

00:03:31.615 --> 00:03:35.770
And just recently,
scientists in Boston have discovered

00:03:35.794 --> 00:03:40.643
a very similar type of pulsing,
cleansing brain-mechanism

00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:42.616
in human beings as well.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.074
Now, some of this discussion
may sound perhaps a little depressing.

00:03:47.098 --> 00:03:49.846
We know that as we get older in life,

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.534
our sleep seems to typically decline,

00:03:52.558 --> 00:03:55.546
and our risk for Alzheimer's
generally increases.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.456
But I think there's actually
a silver lining here,

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.780
because unlike many of the other factors

00:04:00.804 --> 00:04:04.025
that are associated
with aging and Alzheimer's disease,

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.225
for example, changes
in the physical structure of the brain,

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:10.168
those are fiendishly difficult to treat

00:04:10.192 --> 00:04:14.383
and medicine doesn't have any good
wholesale approaches right now.

00:04:14.407 --> 00:04:17.746
But that sleep is a missing piece

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.953
in the explanatory puzzle
of aging and Alzheimer's disease

00:04:21.977 --> 00:04:25.951
is exciting because we may be
able to do something about it.

00:04:25.975 --> 00:04:29.276
What if we could actually
augment human sleep

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.614
and try to improve the quality

00:04:31.638 --> 00:04:33.956
of that deep sleep in midlife,

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.749
which is when we start to see
the decline in deep sleep

00:04:36.773 --> 00:04:37.962
beginning to happen.

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:39.996
What if we could actually shift

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.933
from a model of late-stage
treatment in Alzheimer's disease

00:04:44.957 --> 00:04:47.750
to a model of midlife prevention?

00:04:47.774 --> 00:04:52.289
Could we go from sick care
to actually healthcare?

00:04:52.313 --> 00:04:54.235
And by modifying sleep,

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.700
could we actually bend the arrow

00:04:56.724 --> 00:05:00.128
of Alzheimer's disease risk
down on itself?

00:05:00.152 --> 00:05:03.593
That's something
that I'm incredibly excited about

00:05:03.617 --> 00:05:07.023
and something that we're actively
researching right now.
