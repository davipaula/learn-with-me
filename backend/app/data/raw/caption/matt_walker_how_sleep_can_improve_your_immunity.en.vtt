00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.818
Often when we're sick

00:00:01.842 --> 00:00:04.715
typically what we want to do
is just curl up in bed

00:00:04.739 --> 00:00:05.928
and go to sleep.

00:00:05.952 --> 00:00:08.294
And in part what we're trying to do

00:00:08.318 --> 00:00:10.187
is sleep ourselves well,

00:00:10.211 --> 00:00:13.235
because there's a very
intimate association

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.604
between our sleep health
and our immune health.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.427
[Sleeping with Science]

00:00:21.482 --> 00:00:26.062
We know that individuals reporting
less than seven hours of sleep a night

00:00:26.086 --> 00:00:31.692
are almost three times more likely
to become infected by the rhinovirus,

00:00:31.716 --> 00:00:33.604
otherwise known as the common cold.

00:00:33.628 --> 00:00:38.061
We also know that women
sleeping five hours or less a night

00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:42.265
are almost 70 percent more likely
to develop pneumonia.

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.719
Well we've also discovered
that sleep can play a role

00:00:45.743 --> 00:00:48.387
in your successful immunization.

00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:51.837
So in one study,
they took a group of individuals

00:00:51.861 --> 00:00:55.712
and they limited them
to four hours of sleep a night

00:00:55.736 --> 00:00:56.900
for six nights.

00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:58.156
And in the other group,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.173
they gave them a full night of sleep

00:01:00.197 --> 00:01:01.880
each and every one of those nights.

00:01:01.904 --> 00:01:05.832
And then during that time period,
they gave them a flu shot

00:01:05.856 --> 00:01:09.520
and they measured
the response to that flu shot.

00:01:09.544 --> 00:01:12.734
What they discovered
is that in those individuals

00:01:12.758 --> 00:01:15.234
who were sleeping just four hours a night,

00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:18.991
they went on to produce
less than 50 percent

00:01:19.015 --> 00:01:21.340
of the normal antibody response.

00:01:21.364 --> 00:01:24.935
So in other words,
if you're not getting sufficient sleep

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:28.991
in the week or the days
before you get your flu shot,

00:01:29.015 --> 00:01:34.546
it may render that vaccination
far less effective as a consequence.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.777
What this tells us,

00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:37.971
and now what we're starting to learn,

00:01:37.995 --> 00:01:40.781
is that it's during sleep at night,

00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:43.186
including deep non-REM sleep,

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.845
when we actually restock the weaponry

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.040
within our immune arsenal.

00:01:49.064 --> 00:01:51.956
We actually stimulate the production

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.442
of numerous different immune factors.

00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:55.624
And furthermore,

00:01:55.648 --> 00:02:00.864
the body actually increases
its sensitivity to those immune factors.

00:02:01.168 --> 00:02:03.304
So you wake up the next day

00:02:03.328 --> 00:02:07.179
as a more robust immune individual.

00:02:07.203 --> 00:02:10.154
So when it comes to your immune system,

00:02:10.178 --> 00:02:12.243
you should perhaps think of sleep

00:02:12.267 --> 00:02:15.643
as one of the best
health insurance policies

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:17.230
that you could ever wish for.
