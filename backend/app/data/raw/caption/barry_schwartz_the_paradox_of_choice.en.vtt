00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.404
I'm going to talk to you about some stuff
that's in this book of mine

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:31.546
that I hope will resonate with
other things you've already heard,

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.784
and I'll try to make
some connections myself,

00:00:33.808 --> 00:00:35.454
in case you miss them.

00:00:35.478 --> 00:00:39.563
But I want to start with
what I call the "official dogma."

00:00:39.983 --> 00:00:41.447
The official dogma of what?

00:00:41.471 --> 00:00:44.819
The official dogma of all Western
industrial societies.

00:00:44.843 --> 00:00:47.122
And the official dogma runs like this:

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:51.815
if we are interested in maximizing
the welfare of our citizens,

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:56.814
the way to do that
is to maximize individual freedom.

00:00:57.965 --> 00:01:02.135
The reason for this is both
that freedom is, in and of itself, good,

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.573
valuable, worthwhile,
essential to being human,

00:01:05.597 --> 00:01:07.976
and because if people have freedom,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.363
then each of us can act on our own

00:01:10.387 --> 00:01:12.681
to do the things
that will maximize our welfare,

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:14.803
and no one has to decide on our behalf.

00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:19.859
The way to maximize freedom
is to maximize choice.

00:01:20.738 --> 00:01:24.594
The more choice people have,
the more freedom they have,

00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:26.221
and the more freedom they have,

00:01:26.245 --> 00:01:27.786
the more welfare they have.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.507
This, I think, is so deeply embedded
in the water supply

00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:37.546
that it wouldn't occur
to anyone to question it.

00:01:38.379 --> 00:01:42.282
And it's also deeply
embedded in our lives.

00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:44.409
I'll give you some examples

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:47.976
of what modern progress
has made possible for us.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.353
This is my supermarket.

00:01:49.854 --> 00:01:51.121
Not such a big one.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.239
I want to say just a word
about salad dressing.

00:01:54.263 --> 00:01:56.976
A hundred seventy-five
salad dressings in my supermarket,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.087
if you don't count
the 10 extra-virgin olive oils

00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:03.093
and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy

00:02:03.117 --> 00:02:05.976
to make a very large number
of your own salad dressings,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.971
in the off-chance that none of the 175
the store has on offer suit you.

00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:13.470
So this is what the supermarket is like.

00:02:13.494 --> 00:02:15.865
And then you go
to the consumer electronics store

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:17.273
to set up a stereo system --

00:02:17.297 --> 00:02:20.976
speakers, CD player,
tape player, tuner, amplifier --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.976
and in this one single
consumer electronics store,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.418
there are that many stereo systems.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.969
We can construct six and a half million
different stereo systems

00:02:33.993 --> 00:02:36.579
out of the components
that are on offer in one store.

00:02:36.603 --> 00:02:38.617
You've got to admit
that's a lot of choice.

00:02:39.294 --> 00:02:43.024
In other domains --
the world of communications.

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.231
There was a time, when I was a boy,

00:02:45.255 --> 00:02:48.072
when you could get any kind
of telephone service you wanted,

00:02:48.096 --> 00:02:49.914
as long as it came from Ma Bell.

00:02:49.938 --> 00:02:52.112
You rented your phone, you didn't buy it.

00:02:52.136 --> 00:02:55.589
One consequence of that, by the way,
is that the phone never broke.

00:02:55.613 --> 00:02:57.976
And those days are gone.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.976
We now have an almost unlimited
variety of phones,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.277
especially in the world of cell phones.

00:03:03.301 --> 00:03:05.344
These are cell phones of the future.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.153
My favorite is the middle one --

00:03:08.177 --> 00:03:11.809
the MP3 player, nose hair trimmer,
and crème brûlée torch.

00:03:11.833 --> 00:03:12.983
And if --

00:03:13.007 --> 00:03:14.696
(Laughter)

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.824
if by some chance you haven't seen
that in your store yet,

00:03:17.848 --> 00:03:20.947
you can rest assured
that one day soon, you will.

00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:24.024
And what this does is it leads people
to walk into their stores,

00:03:24.048 --> 00:03:25.294
asking this question.

00:03:25.785 --> 00:03:28.453
And do you know what the answer
to this question now is?

00:03:28.477 --> 00:03:30.054
The answer is "no."

00:03:30.483 --> 00:03:33.630
It is not possible to buy a cell phone
that doesn't do too much.

00:03:33.654 --> 00:03:39.166
So, in other aspects of life that are much
more significant than buying things,

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.493
the same explosion of choice is true.

00:03:42.517 --> 00:03:44.119
Health care.

00:03:44.143 --> 00:03:46.580
It is no longer the case
in the United States

00:03:46.604 --> 00:03:50.456
that you go to the doctor,
and the doctor tells you what to do.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.003
Instead, you go to the doctor,

00:03:52.027 --> 00:03:55.313
and the doctor tells you,
"Well, we could do A, or we could do B.

00:03:55.337 --> 00:03:57.719
A has these benefits and these risks.

00:03:57.743 --> 00:04:00.066
B has these benefits and these risks.

00:04:00.454 --> 00:04:01.780
What do you want to do?"

00:04:02.138 --> 00:04:04.352
And you say, "Doc, what should I do?"

00:04:04.967 --> 00:04:07.957
And the doc says, "A has
these benefits and risks,

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:09.817
and B has these benefits and risks.

00:04:09.841 --> 00:04:11.380
What do you want to do?"

00:04:11.777 --> 00:04:15.344
And you say, "If you were me,
Doc, what would you do?"

00:04:15.793 --> 00:04:17.957
And the doc says, "But I'm not you."

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:21.674
And the result is --
we call it "patient autonomy,"

00:04:21.698 --> 00:04:23.683
which makes it sound like a good thing,

00:04:23.707 --> 00:04:27.109
but what it really is is a shifting
of the burden and the responsibility

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:28.294
for decision-making

00:04:28.318 --> 00:04:31.060
from somebody who knows something --
namely, the doctor --

00:04:31.084 --> 00:04:33.862
to somebody who knows nothing
and is almost certainly sick

00:04:33.886 --> 00:04:36.634
and thus, not in the best shape
to be making decisions --

00:04:36.658 --> 00:04:37.872
namely, the patient.

00:04:37.896 --> 00:04:40.722
There's enormous marketing
of prescription drugs

00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:42.149
to people like you and me,

00:04:42.173 --> 00:04:44.626
which, if you think about it,
makes no sense at all,

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.826
since we can't buy them.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.191
Why do they market to us
if we can't buy them?

00:04:48.215 --> 00:04:52.213
The answer is that they expect us
to call our doctors the next morning

00:04:52.237 --> 00:04:54.356
and ask for our prescriptions
to be changed.

00:04:55.532 --> 00:04:59.509
Something as dramatic as our identity

00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:02.395
has now become a matter of choice,

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.770
as this slide is meant to indicate.

00:05:05.794 --> 00:05:08.719
We don't inherit an identity;
we get to invent it.

00:05:08.743 --> 00:05:12.038
And we get to reinvent ourselves
as often as we like.

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:15.103
And that means that every day,
when you wake up in the morning,

00:05:15.127 --> 00:05:18.062
you have to decide
what kind of person you want to be.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.711
With respect to marriage and family:

00:05:22.497 --> 00:05:27.455
there was a time when the default
assumption that almost everyone had

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.625
is that you got married
as soon as you could,

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:32.472
and then you started having kids
as soon as you could.

00:05:32.496 --> 00:05:34.904
The only real choice was who,

00:05:34.928 --> 00:05:37.541
not when, and not what you did after.

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:40.976
Nowadays, everything
is very much up for grabs.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.721
I teach wonderfully intelligent students,

00:05:43.745 --> 00:05:47.665
and I assign 20 percent
less work than I used to.

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:50.137
And it's not because they're less smart,

00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:52.466
and it's not because
they're less diligent.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.870
It's because they are preoccupied,
asking themselves,

00:05:55.894 --> 00:05:58.601
"Should I get married or not?
Should I get married now?

00:05:58.625 --> 00:05:59.941
Should I get married later?

00:05:59.965 --> 00:06:02.319
Should I have kids first
or a career first?"

00:06:02.343 --> 00:06:05.072
All of these are consuming questions.

00:06:05.096 --> 00:06:07.214
And they're going to answer
these questions,

00:06:07.238 --> 00:06:09.830
whether or not it means
not doing all the work I assign

00:06:09.854 --> 00:06:11.880
and not getting a good grade
in my courses.

00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:13.057
And indeed they should.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:15.549
These are important questions to answer.

00:06:16.887 --> 00:06:18.319
Work.

00:06:18.343 --> 00:06:20.581
We are blessed, as Carl was pointing out,

00:06:20.605 --> 00:06:26.427
with the technology that enables us
to work every minute of every day

00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:28.491
from any place on the planet --

00:06:28.515 --> 00:06:30.415
except the Randolph Hotel.

00:06:30.777 --> 00:06:33.817
(Laughter)

00:06:33.841 --> 00:06:35.729
(Applause)

00:06:35.753 --> 00:06:37.976
There is one corner, by the way,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.606
that I'm not going to tell anybody about,
where the WiFi actually works.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.504
I'm not telling you about it,
because I want to use it.

00:06:45.528 --> 00:06:46.684
So what this means,

00:06:46.708 --> 00:06:49.802
this incredible freedom of choice
we have with respect to work,

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.673
is that we have to make a decision,

00:06:51.697 --> 00:06:53.556
again and again and again,

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.193
about whether we should
or shouldn't be working.

00:06:56.217 --> 00:06:58.605
We can go to watch our kid play soccer,

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:02.559
and we have our cell phone on one hip
and our Blackberry on our other hip,

00:07:02.583 --> 00:07:05.478
and our laptop, presumably, on our laps.

00:07:05.502 --> 00:07:07.547
And even if they're all shut off,

00:07:07.571 --> 00:07:10.813
every minute that we're watching
our kid mutilate a soccer game,

00:07:10.837 --> 00:07:12.448
we are also asking ourselves,

00:07:12.472 --> 00:07:14.706
"Should I answer this cell phone call?

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.567
Should I respond to this email?
Should I draft this letter?"

00:07:17.591 --> 00:07:20.167
And even if the answer
to the question is "no,"

00:07:20.191 --> 00:07:23.483
it's certainly going to make
the experience of your kid's soccer game

00:07:23.507 --> 00:07:25.642
very different than it would've been.

00:07:25.666 --> 00:07:27.707
So everywhere we look,

00:07:27.731 --> 00:07:31.489
big things and small things,
material things and lifestyle things,

00:07:31.513 --> 00:07:33.741
life is a matter of choice.

00:07:34.503 --> 00:07:38.062
And the world we used
to live in looked like this.

00:07:38.086 --> 00:07:40.211
[Well, actually,
they are written in stone.]

00:07:40.235 --> 00:07:42.177
That is to say, there were some choices,

00:07:42.201 --> 00:07:44.263
but not everything was a matter of choice.

00:07:44.287 --> 00:07:46.367
The world we now live in looks like this.

00:07:46.391 --> 00:07:48.434
[The Ten Commandments Do-It-Yourself Kit]

00:07:48.458 --> 00:07:51.883
And the question is:
Is this good news or bad news?

00:07:53.047 --> 00:07:55.409
And the answer is "yes."

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.611
(Laughter)

00:07:58.357 --> 00:08:00.619
We all know what's good about it,

00:08:00.643 --> 00:08:03.278
so I'm going to talk
about what's bad about it.

00:08:03.302 --> 00:08:06.447
All of this choice has two effects,

00:08:06.471 --> 00:08:08.420
two negative effects on people.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.715
One effect, paradoxically,

00:08:11.739 --> 00:08:15.242
is that it produces paralysis
rather than liberation.

00:08:15.698 --> 00:08:18.084
With so many options to choose from,

00:08:18.108 --> 00:08:21.736
people find it very difficult
to choose at all.

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:24.976
I'll give you one very dramatic
example of this,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.682
a study that was done of investments
in voluntary retirement plans.

00:08:31.109 --> 00:08:36.540
A colleague of mine got access
to investment records from Vanguard,

00:08:36.564 --> 00:08:38.288
the gigantic mutual fund company,

00:08:38.312 --> 00:08:41.976
of about a million employees
and about 2,000 different workplaces.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.755
What she found is that for every
10 mutual funds the employer offered,

00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:51.537
rate of participation
went down two percent.

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:56.656
You offer 50 funds -- 10 percent
fewer employees participate

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:58.337
than if you only offer five.

00:08:59.014 --> 00:09:00.173
Why?

00:09:00.197 --> 00:09:02.181
Because with 50 funds to choose from,

00:09:02.205 --> 00:09:05.976
it's so damn hard to decide
which fund to choose,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.048
that you'll just put it off till tomorrow,

00:09:08.072 --> 00:09:09.271
and then tomorrow

00:09:09.295 --> 00:09:11.774
and then tomorrow and tomorrow,

00:09:11.798 --> 00:09:13.628
and, of course, tomorrow never comes.

00:09:13.652 --> 00:09:15.664
Understand that not only does this mean

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:18.647
that people are going to have
to eat dog food when they retire

00:09:18.671 --> 00:09:20.844
because they don't have
enough money put away,

00:09:20.868 --> 00:09:23.378
it also means that making
the decision is so hard

00:09:23.402 --> 00:09:27.058
that they pass up significant
matching money from the employer.

00:09:27.082 --> 00:09:31.320
By not participating, they are passing up
as much as 5,000 dollars a year

00:09:31.344 --> 00:09:32.503
from the employer,

00:09:32.527 --> 00:09:34.659
who would happily
match their contribution.

00:09:35.087 --> 00:09:38.774
So paralysis is a consequence
of having too many choices.

00:09:38.798 --> 00:09:41.471
And I think it makes
the world look like this.

00:09:41.871 --> 00:09:45.696
[And lastly, for all eternity,
French, bleu cheese or ranch?]

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.976
(Laughter)

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.012
You really want to get the decision right
if it's for all eternity, right?

00:09:52.036 --> 00:09:55.440
You don't want to pick the wrong
mutual fund or wrong salad dressing.

00:09:55.464 --> 00:09:56.616
So that's one effect.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.301
The second effect is that, even if
we manage to overcome the paralysis

00:10:01.325 --> 00:10:03.356
and make a choice,

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.348
we end up less satisfied
with the result of the choice

00:10:07.372 --> 00:10:10.172
than we would be if we had
fewer options to choose from.

00:10:10.769 --> 00:10:12.647
And there are several reasons for this.

00:10:13.359 --> 00:10:17.108
One of them is, with a lot of different
salad dressings to choose from,

00:10:17.132 --> 00:10:20.666
if you buy one and it's not perfect --
and what salad dressing is? --

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.811
it's easy to imagine
that you could've made a different choice

00:10:23.835 --> 00:10:25.331
that would've been better.

00:10:25.864 --> 00:10:27.137
And what happens is,

00:10:27.161 --> 00:10:32.139
this imagined alternative induces you
to regret the decision you made,

00:10:32.163 --> 00:10:35.052
and this regret subtracts
from the satisfaction you get

00:10:35.076 --> 00:10:36.481
out of the decision you made,

00:10:36.505 --> 00:10:38.152
even if it was a good decision.

00:10:38.626 --> 00:10:42.334
The more options there are,
the easier it is to regret anything at all

00:10:42.358 --> 00:10:44.882
that is disappointing
about the option that you chose.

00:10:45.342 --> 00:10:48.351
Second, what economists
call "opportunity costs."

00:10:48.375 --> 00:10:50.384
Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning

00:10:50.408 --> 00:10:55.071
of talking about how much the way
in which we value things

00:10:55.095 --> 00:10:57.367
depends on what we compare them to.

00:10:57.391 --> 00:11:00.976
Well, when there are lots
of alternatives to consider,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.976
it's easy to imagine the attractive
features of alternatives that you reject

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.668
that make you less satisfied
with the alternative that you've chosen.

00:11:11.692 --> 00:11:12.843
Here's an example.

00:11:12.867 --> 00:11:16.841
[I can't stop thinking about those other
available parking spaces on W 85th Street]

00:11:16.865 --> 00:11:18.781
If you're not a New Yorker, I apologize.

00:11:18.805 --> 00:11:20.835
Here's what you're supposed
to be thinking.

00:11:20.859 --> 00:11:23.857
Here's this couple on the Hamptons.
Very expensive real estate.

00:11:23.881 --> 00:11:26.837
Gorgeous beach. Beautiful day.
They have it all to themselves.

00:11:26.861 --> 00:11:28.053
What could be better?

00:11:28.077 --> 00:11:29.655
"Damn it," this guy is thinking,

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:33.670
"It's August. Everybody
in my Manhattan neighborhood is away.

00:11:33.694 --> 00:11:36.724
I could be parking
right in front of my building."

00:11:37.851 --> 00:11:41.515
And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea

00:11:41.539 --> 00:11:44.620
that he is missing
the opportunity, day after day,

00:11:44.644 --> 00:11:46.362
to have a great parking space.

00:11:46.386 --> 00:11:48.099
(Laughter)

00:11:48.123 --> 00:11:51.109
Opportunity costs
subtract from the satisfaction

00:11:51.133 --> 00:11:52.774
that we get out of what we choose,

00:11:52.798 --> 00:11:54.631
even when what we choose is terrific.

00:11:55.178 --> 00:11:57.529
And the more options
there are to consider,

00:11:57.553 --> 00:11:59.699
the more attractive features
of these options

00:11:59.723 --> 00:12:02.737
are going to be reflected by us
as opportunity costs.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.499
Here's another example.

00:12:05.721 --> 00:12:08.865
(Laughter)

00:12:08.889 --> 00:12:11.574
Now, this cartoon makes a lot of points.

00:12:11.598 --> 00:12:14.731
It makes points about
living in the moment as well,

00:12:14.755 --> 00:12:16.807
and probably about doing things slowly.

00:12:16.831 --> 00:12:19.942
But one point it makes is that whenever
you're choosing one thing,

00:12:19.966 --> 00:12:21.839
you're choosing not to do other things,

00:12:21.863 --> 00:12:24.696
and those other things may have
lots of attractive features,

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.646
and it's going to make what you're doing

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:27.821
less attractive.

00:12:27.845 --> 00:12:29.603
Third: escalation of expectations.

00:12:29.627 --> 00:12:32.380
This hit me when I went
to replace my jeans.

00:12:32.404 --> 00:12:34.507
I wear jeans almost all the time.

00:12:34.531 --> 00:12:37.021
There was a time
when jeans came in one flavor,

00:12:37.045 --> 00:12:39.114
and you bought them,
and they fit like crap.

00:12:39.138 --> 00:12:40.816
They were incredibly uncomfortable,

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.769
and if you wore them long enough
and washed them enough times,

00:12:43.793 --> 00:12:45.108
they started to feel OK.

00:12:45.132 --> 00:12:48.222
I went to replace my jeans
after years of wearing these old ones.

00:12:48.246 --> 00:12:51.444
I said, "I want a pair of jeans.
Here's my size."

00:12:51.468 --> 00:12:52.705
And the shopkeeper said,

00:12:52.729 --> 00:12:55.126
"Do you want slim fit,
easy fit, relaxed fit?

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.512
You want button fly or zipper fly?
You want stonewashed or acid-washed?

00:12:58.536 --> 00:12:59.919
Do you want them distressed?

00:12:59.943 --> 00:13:03.178
Do you want boot cut, tapered?"
Blah, blah, blah on and on he went.

00:13:03.202 --> 00:13:04.704
My jaw dropped.

00:13:04.728 --> 00:13:06.255
And after I recovered, I said,

00:13:06.279 --> 00:13:09.405
"I want the kind that used to be
the only kind."

00:13:09.429 --> 00:13:14.121
(Laughter)

00:13:14.145 --> 00:13:15.977
He had no idea what that was.

00:13:16.001 --> 00:13:17.158
(Laughter)

00:13:17.182 --> 00:13:20.006
So I spent an hour trying on
all these damn jeans,

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.125
and I walked out of the store -- truth --

00:13:22.149 --> 00:13:24.857
with the best-fitting jeans
I had ever had.

00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:26.056
I did better.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.439
All this choice made it possible
for me to do better.

00:13:29.909 --> 00:13:31.060
But --

00:13:31.084 --> 00:13:32.504
I felt worse.

00:13:33.544 --> 00:13:37.317
Why? I wrote a whole book
to try to explain this to myself.

00:13:37.341 --> 00:13:38.500
The reason is --

00:13:38.524 --> 00:13:42.721
(Laughter)

00:13:42.745 --> 00:13:47.759
The reason I felt worse is that
with all of these options available,

00:13:47.783 --> 00:13:53.171
my expectations about how good
a pair of jeans should be went up.

00:13:54.092 --> 00:13:58.546
I had very low, no particular expectations
when they only came in one flavor.

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:02.168
When they came in 100 flavors, damn it,
one of them should've been perfect.

00:14:02.192 --> 00:14:04.402
And what I got was good,
but it wasn't perfect.

00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:07.715
And so I compared what I got
to what I expected,

00:14:07.739 --> 00:14:11.174
and what I got was disappointing
in comparison to what I expected.

00:14:11.198 --> 00:14:13.238
Adding options to people's lives

00:14:13.262 --> 00:14:16.866
can't help but increase
the expectations people have

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.087
about how good those options will be.

00:14:19.111 --> 00:14:22.563
And what that's going to produce
is less satisfaction with results,

00:14:22.587 --> 00:14:24.224
even when they're good results.

00:14:24.248 --> 00:14:26.933
[It all looks so great.
I can't wait to be disappointed.]

00:14:26.957 --> 00:14:29.119
Nobody in the world
of marketing knows this.

00:14:29.143 --> 00:14:33.327
Because if they did, you wouldn't all know
what this was about.

00:14:33.959 --> 00:14:35.863
The truth is more like this.

00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:39.590
[Everything was better back
when everything was worse.]

00:14:39.614 --> 00:14:43.626
The reason that everything was better
back when everything was worse

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.792
is that when everything was worse,

00:14:45.816 --> 00:14:47.587
it was actually possible for people

00:14:47.611 --> 00:14:50.165
to have experiences
that were a pleasant surprise.

00:14:50.999 --> 00:14:55.511
Nowadays, the world we live in --
we affluent, industrialized citizens,

00:14:55.535 --> 00:14:57.512
with perfection the expectation --

00:14:57.536 --> 00:14:59.041
the best you can ever hope for

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:01.730
is that stuff is as good
as you expect it to be.

00:15:01.754 --> 00:15:03.674
You will never be pleasantly surprised,

00:15:03.698 --> 00:15:05.745
because your expectations,
my expectations,

00:15:05.769 --> 00:15:07.103
have gone through the roof.

00:15:07.127 --> 00:15:10.484
The secret to happiness --
this is what you all came for --

00:15:10.508 --> 00:15:13.057
the secret to happiness is:

00:15:13.081 --> 00:15:15.143
low expectations.

00:15:15.167 --> 00:15:18.412
(Laughter)

00:15:18.436 --> 00:15:19.826
[You'll do]

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:21.326
(Applause)

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:22.832
(Laughter)

00:15:24.483 --> 00:15:25.673
I want to say --

00:15:25.697 --> 00:15:28.284
just a little autobiographical moment --

00:15:28.308 --> 00:15:31.298
that I actually am married to a wife,

00:15:31.322 --> 00:15:33.273
and she's really quite wonderful.

00:15:33.297 --> 00:15:34.640
I couldn't have done better.

00:15:34.664 --> 00:15:36.229
I didn't settle.

00:15:36.253 --> 00:15:38.728
But settling isn't always
such a bad thing.

00:15:39.158 --> 00:15:40.308
Finally,

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.397
one consequence of buying
a bad-fitting pair of jeans

00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:46.607
when there is only one kind to buy

00:15:46.631 --> 00:15:50.352
is that when you are dissatisfied
and you ask why, who's responsible,

00:15:50.376 --> 00:15:52.769
the answer is clear:
the world is responsible.

00:15:52.793 --> 00:15:54.512
What could you do?

00:15:54.536 --> 00:15:57.534
When there are hundreds
of different styles of jeans available

00:15:57.558 --> 00:15:59.774
and you buy one that is disappointing

00:15:59.798 --> 00:16:02.311
and you ask why, who's responsible,

00:16:02.335 --> 00:16:06.581
it is equally clear that the answer
to the question is "you."

00:16:07.264 --> 00:16:08.766
You could have done better.

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:11.976
With a hundred different kinds
of jeans on display,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.177
there is no excuse for failure.

00:16:14.201 --> 00:16:16.653
And so when people make decisions,

00:16:16.677 --> 00:16:19.304
and even though the results
of the decisions are good,

00:16:19.328 --> 00:16:21.726
they feel disappointed about them;

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:23.727
they blame themselves.

00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:26.796
Clinical depression has exploded
in the industrial world

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.217
in the last generation.

00:16:28.241 --> 00:16:31.976
I believe a significant -- not the only,
but a significant -- contributor

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.440
to this explosion of depression
and also suicide,

00:16:35.464 --> 00:16:38.041
is that people have experiences
that are disappointing

00:16:38.065 --> 00:16:39.803
because their standards are so high,

00:16:39.827 --> 00:16:43.016
and then when they have to explain
these experiences to themselves,

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.440
they think they're at fault.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.626
So the net result is that we do
better in general, objectively,

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:51.308
and we feel worse.

00:16:51.935 --> 00:16:54.702
So let me remind you:

00:16:54.726 --> 00:16:59.340
this is the official dogma,
the one that we all take to be true,

00:16:59.364 --> 00:17:01.329
and it's all false.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.919
It is not true.

00:17:03.292 --> 00:17:06.971
There's no question that some choice
is better than none.

00:17:07.567 --> 00:17:09.614
But it doesn't follow from that

00:17:09.638 --> 00:17:12.085
that more choice
is better than some choice.

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:14.647
There's some magical amount.
I don't know what it is.

00:17:14.671 --> 00:17:17.698
I'm pretty confident that we have
long since passed the point

00:17:17.722 --> 00:17:20.087
where options improve our welfare.

00:17:20.452 --> 00:17:23.409
Now, as a policy matter --
I'm almost done --

00:17:23.433 --> 00:17:26.817
as a policy matter,
the thing to think about is this:

00:17:26.841 --> 00:17:31.790
what enables all of this choice
in industrial societies

00:17:31.814 --> 00:17:33.908
is material affluence.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:36.286
There are lots of places in the world,

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:38.285
and we have heard about several of them,

00:17:38.309 --> 00:17:41.042
where their problem is not
that they have too much choice.

00:17:41.066 --> 00:17:42.955
Their problem is they have too little.

00:17:42.979 --> 00:17:46.559
So the stuff I'm talking about
is the peculiar problem

00:17:46.583 --> 00:17:49.648
of modern, affluent, Western societies.

00:17:49.672 --> 00:17:52.897
And what is so frustrating
and infuriating is this:

00:17:52.921 --> 00:17:54.718
Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday

00:17:54.742 --> 00:18:01.636
about how these expensive
and difficult-to-install child seats

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.358
don't help.

00:18:04.056 --> 00:18:05.661
It's a waste of money.

00:18:05.685 --> 00:18:10.501
What I'm telling you is that
these expensive, complicated choices --

00:18:10.525 --> 00:18:12.383
it's not simply that they don't help.

00:18:12.407 --> 00:18:13.976
They actually hurt.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.557
They actually make us worse off.

00:18:16.928 --> 00:18:20.679
If some of what enables
people in our societies

00:18:20.703 --> 00:18:22.702
to make all of the choices we make

00:18:22.726 --> 00:18:27.430
were shifted to societies
in which people have too few options,

00:18:27.454 --> 00:18:29.785
not only would those
people's lives be improved,

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:31.934
but ours would be improved also.

00:18:31.958 --> 00:18:35.277
This is what economists call
a "Pareto-improving move."

00:18:35.301 --> 00:18:38.713
Income redistribution will make
everyone better off,

00:18:38.737 --> 00:18:40.149
not just poor people,

00:18:40.173 --> 00:18:43.080
because of how all this excess
choice plagues us.

00:18:43.722 --> 00:18:44.879
So to conclude.

00:18:44.903 --> 00:18:47.267
[You can be anything
you want to be -- no limits.]

00:18:47.291 --> 00:18:50.946
You're supposed to read this cartoon
and, being a sophisticated person, say,

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:55.359
"Ah! What does this fish know?
Nothing is possible in this fishbowl."

00:18:55.753 --> 00:18:58.607
Impoverished imagination,
a myopic view of the world --

00:18:58.631 --> 00:19:00.311
that's the way I read it at first.

00:19:00.335 --> 00:19:02.153
The more I thought about it, however,

00:19:02.177 --> 00:19:05.976
the more I came to the view
that this fish knows something.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.212
Because the truth of the matter is,

00:19:08.236 --> 00:19:12.469
if you shatter the fishbowl
so that everything is possible,

00:19:12.493 --> 00:19:13.906
you don't have freedom.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:15.706
You have paralysis.

00:19:16.373 --> 00:19:19.905
If you shatter this fishbowl
so that everything is possible,

00:19:19.929 --> 00:19:22.701
you decrease satisfaction.

00:19:23.184 --> 00:19:26.804
You increase paralysis,
and you decrease satisfaction.

00:19:26.828 --> 00:19:28.493
Everybody needs a fishbowl.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.344
This one is almost
certainly too limited --

00:19:31.368 --> 00:19:34.373
perhaps even for the fish,
certainly for us.

00:19:34.397 --> 00:19:38.865
But the absence of some metaphorical
fishbowl is a recipe for misery

00:19:38.889 --> 00:19:40.674
and, I suspect, disaster.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.270
Thank you very much.

00:19:42.294 --> 00:19:43.936
(Applause)
