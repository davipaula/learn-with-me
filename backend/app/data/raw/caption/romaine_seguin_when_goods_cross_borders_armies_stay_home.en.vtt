00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:10.532
Two years ago,
in a small village in Nigeria,

00:00:11.045 --> 00:00:16.654
men with AK-47s stormed
Chibok Government Secondary School.

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:20.273
Men from the extremist group, Boko Haram,

00:00:20.968 --> 00:00:27.262
kidnapped 276 young, innocent schoolgirls.

00:00:27.286 --> 00:00:31.453
Today, 218 are still missing.

00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:37.398
I worked in and out of Nigeria
for three years starting in 2007,

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:41.797
and I remember seeing the kids
going to school along dirt roads.

00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:47.179
They had smiles, they were polite,
they were dressed neatly.

00:00:47.203 --> 00:00:49.765
They often talked about the books
they were reading.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:58.046
That was tough on the kids,
but they went to school for a safe place.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.808
They went to school
for dreams of a better future.

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:07.642
But turning those dreams
into reality in Nigeria is difficult,

00:01:08.291 --> 00:01:12.005
because 61% of the people
live at poverty level.

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:15.069
Compare that to the US at 15%.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.322
The annual income
is slightly below $6,000;

00:01:20.742 --> 00:01:24.299
compare that to the US, of $56,000.

00:01:24.928 --> 00:01:26.610
Now you see the problem.

00:01:27.341 --> 00:01:31.832
But I wasn't there in Nigeria
trying to resolve an income disparity.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:36.400
I wasn't there trying
to volunteer for a charity,

00:01:36.424 --> 00:01:40.473
or to set up a nonprofit organization.

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:46.714
I was there to promote trade
where it's very limited.

00:01:47.777 --> 00:01:53.834
I strongly believe when communities
are isolated from the global economy,

00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:59.242
they could become the breeding grounds
of groups like Boko Haram.

00:02:00.124 --> 00:02:03.193
Just the definition
of "Boko Haram" stands for:

00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:06.056
"Western education is forbidden."

00:02:07.052 --> 00:02:09.846
That isolation in itself is dangerous.

00:02:11.255 --> 00:02:13.015
I ask you one question:

00:02:15.016 --> 00:02:17.423
Would those girls
still be in school in Chibok

00:02:17.447 --> 00:02:21.239
if the conditions were different
that gave rise to Boko Haram?

00:02:21.263 --> 00:02:22.727
You know, you have to wonder,

00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:27.773
what if Nigerian people had access
to gain full employment?

00:02:28.622 --> 00:02:32.885
Or villages like Chibok were more
integrated in the global economy?

00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:38.250
Or families could break that poverty cycle
through jobs and education?

00:02:39.737 --> 00:02:42.015
Trade is a powerful weapon.

00:02:43.535 --> 00:02:46.854
Trade can fight against
poverty and injustice.

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.990
Trade is the gun
to combat human trafficking.

00:02:51.742 --> 00:02:54.253
Trade provides medicine to the sick.

00:02:55.244 --> 00:02:58.613
Trade provides a roof
for people in need of shelter.

00:02:59.668 --> 00:03:04.693
Trade is the answer to give dignity back
to millions of unprivileged people.

00:03:05.706 --> 00:03:09.155
Trade is a humanitarian's
strongest weapon.

00:03:10.046 --> 00:03:14.212
I work for a company
that facilitates trade in 220 countries,

00:03:14.917 --> 00:03:18.060
and I've personally assisted
trade in 46 of them.

00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:20.710
I've seen trade in action.

00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:22.575
I see trade work.

00:03:23.412 --> 00:03:26.027
But you don't have to take my word for it:

00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:28.654
economists have been
studying it for years.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.910
In his book "The World Is Flat,"

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.749
Tom Friedman said when countries
trade with each other,

00:03:35.773 --> 00:03:38.069
they're the same supply chain,

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:41.658
and they don't inflict
military damage on each other.

00:03:42.825 --> 00:03:49.139
But Secretary of State, Cordell Hull,
who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1945,

00:03:49.163 --> 00:03:50.369
said it best:

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.346
"When goods do not cross borders,

00:03:55.243 --> 00:03:56.433
armies do."

00:03:57.415 --> 00:04:00.878
So what is this magical weapon
I call "trade"?

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:02.762
It's simple:

00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:05.140
I have something you want,

00:04:05.557 --> 00:04:07.544
you have something I need.

00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:10.154
We make an exchange.

00:04:10.813 --> 00:04:12.583
But the question is:

00:04:12.973 --> 00:04:15.585
How can something so simple

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.627
have such a dramatic impact
on poverty and security?

00:04:20.934 --> 00:04:22.414
Let's start with poverty.

00:04:23.045 --> 00:04:25.332
There's no better example than China.

00:04:25.858 --> 00:04:30.604
Before China adopted
economic reform 37 years ago,

00:04:31.118 --> 00:04:34.557
it maintained policies
to keep the country poor.

00:04:35.218 --> 00:04:39.659
Then in 1979, it implemented
economic reform.

00:04:39.683 --> 00:04:43.436
It allowed international trade
and foreign investment.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.588
And we all know what happened --

00:04:45.612 --> 00:04:48.260
China's the fastest-growing economy.

00:04:48.284 --> 00:04:49.765
But here's something:

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.328
In that nation, in 1990,

00:04:53.352 --> 00:04:56.772
the annual income was only $980.

00:04:57.137 --> 00:05:01.980
Fast-forward to 2015,
it's a little over $14,000.

00:05:02.541 --> 00:05:06.905
The poverty levels decreased
[from] 84% from 1980

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:09.737
to 10% in 2013.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.903
The unemployment rate is at 4.1%,

00:05:13.927 --> 00:05:17.712
slightly below 4.9% of that in the US.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.350
Let's talk security.

00:05:20.952 --> 00:05:24.376
I started traveling in Colombia
in 2010, and people were saying,

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.388
"Are you scared? Are you nervous?"

00:05:26.815 --> 00:05:29.635
And that's because,
10 to 15 years earlier,

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:34.539
the drug lords and the drug cartel
would kidnap and torture people.

00:05:34.983 --> 00:05:39.699
But then the government
pumped in economic resources,

00:05:39.723 --> 00:05:42.600
and they stabilized
their political platform.

00:05:42.624 --> 00:05:44.465
That made a huge difference.

00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:47.540
I feel very safe going to Colombia,
seeing customers.

00:05:47.564 --> 00:05:50.680
In fact, I just got back
from Bogotá last week.

00:05:51.902 --> 00:05:54.926
Colombia thanks trade
for improved security,

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:56.765
reduction of poverty,

00:05:57.163 --> 00:05:59.749
and a very attractive image to the world.

00:05:59.773 --> 00:06:02.128
And I have a beautiful example of that.

00:06:02.807 --> 00:06:07.470
Colombia exported $1.3 billion

00:06:07.494 --> 00:06:10.622
of roses and flowers in 2013,

00:06:10.646 --> 00:06:13.672
with 75% coming to the US.

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:19.266
So you see, trade
clearly is a powerful weapon

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.312
to fight poverty and crime.

00:06:22.177 --> 00:06:24.057
But it doesn't stop there.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.645
If I was to say "Haiti,"
what would pop into your mind?

00:06:29.652 --> 00:06:33.320
Earthquake, hunger, poverty.

00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:36.527
Would anyone think of fashion?

00:06:37.107 --> 00:06:43.400
In 2010, the earthquake
killed 230,000 Haitians,

00:06:43.424 --> 00:06:46.533
and displaced 1.5 million.

00:06:47.258 --> 00:06:51.260
Julie Colombino from Orlando, Florida
went there to help.

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:56.928
She saw humanitarian aid pour in,
but she knew it wasn't sustainable.

00:06:57.268 --> 00:07:01.365
She started a nonprofit company
called "REBUILD globally,"

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:06.805
and this nonprofit taught Haitians
how to make sandals out of old tires,

00:07:06.829 --> 00:07:08.727
which are very abundant there.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.386
From that nonprofit company,
spun Deux Mains, a profit company,

00:07:13.756 --> 00:07:16.753
and that caught the eye of Kenneth Cole.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.182
Haiti has something
the fashion world needs.

00:07:20.206 --> 00:07:24.346
They have great designs,
they have top-quality craftsmanship,

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.477
they have eco-friendly products.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.558
Kenneth Cole has the global brand
and the distribution model

00:07:31.582 --> 00:07:33.876
to give Deux Mains shoes to the world.

00:07:34.814 --> 00:07:37.043
Trade, pure and simple.

00:07:37.606 --> 00:07:42.247
Deux Mains has made more than 2,400 pairs
of sandals for Kenneth Cole,

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:47.552
and now is in negotiation with Ron Jon,
another global brand.

00:07:48.382 --> 00:07:50.208
These sandals I have on today?

00:07:50.714 --> 00:07:54.575
Yes, they've got the old tires
on the bottom of them.

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:58.468
But my purchase was made
to help Haiti out of poverty.

00:07:59.119 --> 00:08:04.431
My $70 I paid wasn't a charitable
contribution, it wasn't a handout.

00:08:04.823 --> 00:08:06.471
It was basic economics.

00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:08.222
It was trade at work.

00:08:09.221 --> 00:08:11.832
Julie Colombino shared with me

00:08:11.856 --> 00:08:15.987
that for every 250 pairs
of shoes produced,

00:08:16.832 --> 00:08:19.221
one more Haitian is employed.

00:08:19.616 --> 00:08:21.164
So that got me thinking.

00:08:22.096 --> 00:08:27.685
In the United States, each of us buys
seven and a half pairs of shoes a year.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.914
That's 2.4 billion pairs of shoes.

00:08:31.938 --> 00:08:33.387
Now just think:

00:08:33.411 --> 00:08:39.205
If one-tenth of 1%
was produced in Deux Mains,

00:08:39.229 --> 00:08:42.237
that would be 2.4 million pairs of shoes.

00:08:42.744 --> 00:08:44.128
But more importantly,

00:08:44.152 --> 00:08:48.243
it would pump $120 million
into the Haitian economy,

00:08:48.267 --> 00:08:51.492
and give almost 10,000 people a job.

00:08:52.768 --> 00:08:56.251
That type of employment in Haiti
would have a ripple effect.

00:08:56.608 --> 00:09:00.068
And as workshop supervisor
Jolina Auguste told me,

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:04.721
the more sandals they sell,
the less thieves on the street.

00:09:05.141 --> 00:09:10.316
So you see, when people
have a job, security, money,

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.676
they don't take other people's stuff.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.093
They don't resort to crime to survive.

00:09:15.776 --> 00:09:19.213
They don't get caught up
with the drug lords like in Colombia,

00:09:19.237 --> 00:09:23.888
or terrorism that teaches them
how to use AK-47s.

00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:28.696
The Global Terrorist Index
report in 2015 said

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:34.049
economic conditions play
a very important part in one's decision

00:09:34.553 --> 00:09:37.442
to pursue violent extremism.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.929
The report also says

00:09:40.358 --> 00:09:44.916
Boko Haram is the most deadly
terrorist organization in the world.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:50.641
And it recruits from the most economically
marginalized regions in Nigeria.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.421
But on the other hand,
if there is industrial growth,

00:09:54.881 --> 00:09:58.496
there's less domestic
and international terrorism.

00:09:58.957 --> 00:10:02.322
According to a 2015 study

00:10:02.346 --> 00:10:06.102
that was published
in the Oxford Economic Papers,

00:10:06.596 --> 00:10:10.072
when industrial growth increases by 1%,

00:10:10.826 --> 00:10:14.193
domestic terrorism decreases by 1%.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.171
So what does that mean?

00:10:18.433 --> 00:10:23.458
When communities gain access
to the global economy through trade,

00:10:23.482 --> 00:10:25.838
they reap so many benefits.

00:10:27.297 --> 00:10:29.875
I stand here and ask you
one last question:

00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:36.305
If Chibok were more
connected through trade,

00:10:37.344 --> 00:10:41.141
and those young men
who joined Boko Haram had an option

00:10:41.165 --> 00:10:43.530
to get a job in the formal economy,

00:10:44.784 --> 00:10:46.808
would those girls still be in school?

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:49.825
I think so.

00:10:50.288 --> 00:10:53.557
Trade would have given them
a weapon to fight terrorism.

00:10:54.009 --> 00:10:56.059
Trade would have given them hope.

00:10:56.551 --> 00:10:57.758
Thank you.

00:10:57.782 --> 00:11:02.515
(Applause)
