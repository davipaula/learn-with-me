00:00:13.737 --> 00:00:16.779
Preparing for this talk
has been scarier for me

00:00:16.803 --> 00:00:19.104
than preparing for LSD therapy.

00:00:19.128 --> 00:00:20.955
(Laughter)

00:00:21.414 --> 00:00:24.350
"Psychedelics are to the study of the mind

00:00:24.374 --> 00:00:27.426
what the microscope is to biology

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.946
and the telescope is to astronomy."

00:00:30.338 --> 00:00:33.156
Dr. Stanislav Grof spoke those words.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.197
He's one of the leading
psychedelic researchers in the world,

00:00:36.221 --> 00:00:38.448
and he's also been my mentor.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.926
Today, I'd like to share with you
how psychedelics, when used wisely,

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.633
have the potential to help heal us,

00:00:46.657 --> 00:00:48.799
help inspire us,

00:00:48.823 --> 00:00:51.371
and perhaps even to help save us.

00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:53.170
In the 1950s and 60s,

00:00:53.194 --> 00:00:56.156
psychedelic research flourished
all over the world

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.871
and showed great promise
for the fields of psychiatry,

00:00:59.895 --> 00:01:01.895
psychology and psychotherapy,

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:05.553
neuroscience and the study
of mystical experiences.

00:01:05.577 --> 00:01:08.881
But psychedelics leaked out
of the research settings

00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:11.421
and began to be used
by the counterculture,

00:01:11.445 --> 00:01:14.151
and by the anti-Vietnam War movement.

00:01:14.175 --> 00:01:16.159
And there was unwise use.

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:18.260
And so there was a backlash.

00:01:18.284 --> 00:01:23.903
And in 1970, the US government
criminalized all uses of psychedelics,

00:01:23.927 --> 00:01:26.971
and they began shutting down
all psychedelic research.

00:01:27.323 --> 00:01:30.795
And this ban spread all over the world
and lasted for decades.

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:32.323
and it was tragic,

00:01:32.347 --> 00:01:34.513
since psychedelics are really just tools,

00:01:34.537 --> 00:01:37.752
and whether their outcomes
are beneficial or harmful

00:01:37.776 --> 00:01:40.307
depends on how they're used.

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:45.067
Psychedelic means "mind-manifesting,"

00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:53.183
and it relates to drugs
like LSD, psilocybin, mescaline,

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:57.417
iboga and other drugs.

00:01:57.997 --> 00:01:59.806
When I was 18 years old,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.648
I was a college freshman,

00:02:02.672 --> 00:02:05.966
I was experimenting
with LSD and mescaline,

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.895
and these experiences
brought me in touch with my emotions.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.339
And they helped me have
a spiritual connection

00:02:12.363 --> 00:02:16.373
that unfortunately,
my bar mitzvah did not produce.

00:02:16.397 --> 00:02:18.310
(Laughter)

00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:20.612
When I wanted to tease my parents,

00:02:20.636 --> 00:02:23.325
I would tell them
that they drove me to psychedelics

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.019
because my bar mitzvah had failed
to turn me into a man.

00:02:27.043 --> 00:02:28.979
(Laughter)

00:02:29.892 --> 00:02:31.067
But most importantly,

00:02:31.091 --> 00:02:34.233
psychedelics gave me this feeling
of our shared humanity,

00:02:34.257 --> 00:02:36.542
of our unity with all life.

00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:39.934
And other people reported
that same thing as well.

00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.688
And I felt that these experiences
had the potential

00:02:43.712 --> 00:02:46.313
to help be an antidote

00:02:46.337 --> 00:02:51.424
to tribalism, to fundamentalism,
to genocide and environmental destruction.

00:02:51.448 --> 00:02:53.582
And so I decided to focus my life

00:02:54.432 --> 00:02:56.363
on changing the laws

00:02:56.387 --> 00:03:00.045
and becoming a legal
psychedelic psychotherapist.

00:03:00.625 --> 00:03:04.466
(Applause)

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.522
Now, half a century after the ban,

00:03:06.546 --> 00:03:10.513
we're in the midst of a global renaissance
of psychedelic research.

00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.937
Psychedelic psychotherapy
is showing great promise

00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:18.612
for the treatment of post-traumatic
stress disorder, or PTSD,

00:03:18.636 --> 00:03:23.152
depression, social anxiety,
substance abuse and alcoholism

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.347
and suicide.

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:29.315
Psychedelic psychotherapy is an attempt
to go after the root causes

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:30.490
of the problems,

00:03:30.514 --> 00:03:32.985
with just relatively few administrations,

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:37.509
as contrasted to most
of the psychiatric drugs used today

00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:40.707
that are mostly just reducing symptoms

00:03:40.731 --> 00:03:44.238
and are meant to be taken
on a daily basis.

00:03:45.516 --> 00:03:49.263
Psychedelics are now also being used
as tools for neuroscience

00:03:49.287 --> 00:03:50.736
to study brain function

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.283
and to study the enduring mystery
of human consciousness.

00:03:55.307 --> 00:03:58.522
And psychedelics and the mystical
experiences they produce

00:03:58.546 --> 00:04:02.133
are being explored for their connections
between meditation and mindfulness,

00:04:02.157 --> 00:04:04.702
including a paper just recently published

00:04:04.726 --> 00:04:08.720
about lifelong zen meditators
taking psilocybin

00:04:08.744 --> 00:04:10.632
in the midst of a meditation retreat

00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:14.171
and showing long-term benefits
and brain changes.

00:04:15.411 --> 00:04:16.926
Now, how do these drugs work?

00:04:17.577 --> 00:04:19.869
Modern neuroscience research
has demonstrated

00:04:19.893 --> 00:04:22.371
that psychedelics reduce activity

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:24.918
in what's known as the brain's
default mode network.

00:04:24.942 --> 00:04:27.436
This is where we create our sense of self.

00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:30.072
It's our equivalent to the ego,

00:04:30.096 --> 00:04:32.721
and it filters all incoming information

00:04:32.745 --> 00:04:36.310
according to our personal
needs and priorities.

00:04:36.334 --> 00:04:39.852
When activity is reduced
in the default mode network,

00:04:39.876 --> 00:04:44.154
our ego shifts from the foreground
to the background,

00:04:44.178 --> 00:04:49.779
and we see that it's just part
of a larger field of awareness.

00:04:49.803 --> 00:04:51.041
It's similar to the shift

00:04:51.065 --> 00:04:54.564
that Copernicus and Galileo were
able to produce in humanity

00:04:54.588 --> 00:04:55.770
using the telescope

00:04:55.794 --> 00:05:00.458
to show that the earth was no
longer the center of the universe,

00:05:00.482 --> 00:05:03.784
but was actually something
that revolved around the sun,

00:05:03.808 --> 00:05:05.961
something bigger than itself.

00:05:06.355 --> 00:05:09.244
For some people, this shift in awareness

00:05:09.268 --> 00:05:11.312
is the most important

00:05:11.336 --> 00:05:14.545
and among the most important
experiences of their lives.

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.815
They feel more connected
to the world bigger than themselves.

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:20.577
They feel more altruistic,

00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:23.657
and they lose some of their fear of death.

00:05:24.386 --> 00:05:26.164
Not all drugs work this way.

00:05:26.188 --> 00:05:30.196
MDMA, also known as Ecstasy, or Molly,

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.649
works fundamentally different.

00:05:31.673 --> 00:05:34.317
And I'll be able to share with you
the story of Marcela,

00:05:34.341 --> 00:05:37.577
who suffered from
post-traumatic stress disorder

00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:40.243
from a violent sexual assault.

00:05:40.786 --> 00:05:44.373
Marcela and I were introduced in 1984,

00:05:44.397 --> 00:05:46.627
when MDMA was still legal,

00:05:46.651 --> 00:05:50.635
but it was beginning also
to leak out of therapeutic circles.

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:54.640
Marcela had tried MDMA
in a recreational setting,

00:05:54.664 --> 00:05:58.315
and during that, her past trauma
flooded her awareness

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:02.373
and it intensified her suicidal feelings.

00:06:03.006 --> 00:06:04.672
During our first conversation,

00:06:04.696 --> 00:06:08.814
I shared that when MDMA
is taken therapeutically,

00:06:08.838 --> 00:06:12.115
it can reduce the fear
of difficult emotions,

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:15.551
and she could help move forward
past her trauma.

00:06:15.575 --> 00:06:18.642
I asked her to promise
not to commit suicide

00:06:19.642 --> 00:06:21.593
if we were to work together.

00:06:21.617 --> 00:06:24.755
She agreed and made that promise.

00:06:25.498 --> 00:06:27.308
During her therapeutic sessions,

00:06:27.332 --> 00:06:32.775
Marcela was able to process
her trauma more fluidly, more easily.

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:36.371
And yet, she was able to tell

00:06:36.395 --> 00:06:39.979
that the rapist had told her
that if she ever shared her story,

00:06:40.003 --> 00:06:41.203
he would kill her.

00:06:41.823 --> 00:06:45.923
And she realized that that was
keeping her a prisoner in her own mind.

00:06:46.307 --> 00:06:48.378
So being able to share the story

00:06:48.402 --> 00:06:53.008
and experience the feelings
and the thoughts in her mind

00:06:53.032 --> 00:06:54.182
freed her,

00:06:54.206 --> 00:06:55.500
and she was able to decide

00:06:55.524 --> 00:06:58.143
that she wanted
to move forward with her life.

00:06:58.167 --> 00:06:59.376
And in that moment,

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.973
I realized that MDMA could be very
effective for treating PTSD.

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:08.471
Now, 35 years later,
after Marcela's treatment,

00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:11.091
she's actually a therapist,

00:07:11.115 --> 00:07:15.615
training other therapists to help people
overcome PTSD with MDMA.

00:07:17.657 --> 00:07:19.991
Now, how does MDMA work?

00:07:20.015 --> 00:07:21.951
How did MDMA help Marcela?

00:07:22.387 --> 00:07:25.865
People who have PTSD
have brains that are different

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:28.379
from those of us who don't have PTSD.

00:07:28.403 --> 00:07:31.799
They have a hyperactive amygdala,
where we process fear.

00:07:31.823 --> 00:07:35.569
They have reduced activity
in the prefrontal cortex,

00:07:35.593 --> 00:07:37.355
where we think logically.

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:39.951
And they have reduced activity
in the hippocampus,

00:07:39.975 --> 00:07:43.895
where we store memories
into long-term storage.

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:47.665
MDMA changes the brain
in the opposite way.

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:50.434
MDMA reduces activity in the amygdala,

00:07:50.458 --> 00:07:53.736
increases activity
in the prefrontal cortex

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.403
and increases connectivity
between the amygdala and the hippocampus

00:07:57.427 --> 00:08:01.374
to remit traumatic memories
to move into long-term storage.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.069
Recently, researchers at Johns Hopkins
published a paper in "Nature,"

00:08:06.093 --> 00:08:09.440
in which they demonstrated
that MDMA releases oxytocin,

00:08:09.464 --> 00:08:12.418
the hormone of love and nurturing.

00:08:12.744 --> 00:08:15.899
The same researchers
also did studies in octopuses,

00:08:15.923 --> 00:08:20.029
who are normally asocial,
unless it's mating season.

00:08:20.053 --> 00:08:22.672
But lo and behold, you give them MDMA,

00:08:22.696 --> 00:08:24.688
and they become prosocial.

00:08:24.712 --> 00:08:26.219
(Laughter)

00:08:27.388 --> 00:08:30.142
Several months after
Marcela and I worked together,

00:08:30.166 --> 00:08:34.788
the Drug Enforcement Administration
moved to criminalize Ecstasy,

00:08:34.812 --> 00:08:37.219
having no knowledge
of its therapeutic use.

00:08:37.243 --> 00:08:38.982
So I went to Washington,

00:08:39.006 --> 00:08:42.625
and I went into the headquarters
of the Drug Enforcement Administration,

00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:45.013
and I filed a lawsuit demanding a hearing,

00:08:45.037 --> 00:08:48.236
at which psychiatrists
and psychotherapists

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.738
would be able to present information
about therapeutic use of MDMA

00:08:51.762 --> 00:08:54.008
to try to keep it legal.

00:08:54.032 --> 00:08:56.805
And in the middle of the hearing,
the DEA freaked out,

00:08:56.829 --> 00:08:59.691
declared an emergency

00:08:59.715 --> 00:09:02.342
and criminalized all uses of MDMA.

00:09:02.366 --> 00:09:05.195
And so the only way
that I could see to bring it back

00:09:05.219 --> 00:09:07.965
was through science, through medicine

00:09:07.989 --> 00:09:10.277
and through the FDA
drug development process.

00:09:10.301 --> 00:09:13.148
So in 1986, I started MAPS

00:09:13.172 --> 00:09:17.153
as a nonprofit psychedelic
pharmaceutical company.

00:09:17.609 --> 00:09:20.545
It took us 30 years, till 2016,

00:09:20.569 --> 00:09:24.426
to develop the data that we needed
to present to FDA

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:28.293
to request permission to move
into the large-scale Phase 3 studies

00:09:28.317 --> 00:09:31.219
that are required to prove
safety and efficacy

00:09:31.243 --> 00:09:34.280
before you get approval
for prescription use.

00:09:34.694 --> 00:09:38.438
Tony was a veteran
in one of our pilot studies.

00:09:38.998 --> 00:09:40.982
According to the Veterans Administration,

00:09:41.006 --> 00:09:44.133
there's over a million veterans now
disabled with PTSD.

00:09:44.546 --> 00:09:48.077
And at least 20 veterans a day
are committing suicide,

00:09:48.101 --> 00:09:50.864
many of them from PTSD.

00:09:51.555 --> 00:09:56.435
The treatment that Tony was to receive
was three and a half months long.

00:09:56.459 --> 00:09:57.952
But during that period of time,

00:09:57.976 --> 00:10:00.760
he would only get MDMA on three occasions,

00:10:00.784 --> 00:10:04.664
separated by 12, 90-minute
non-drug psychotherapy sessions,

00:10:04.688 --> 00:10:07.625
three before the first
MDMA session for preparation

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:11.776
and three after each
MDMA session for integration.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.575
We call our treatment approach
"inner-directed therapy,"

00:10:15.599 --> 00:10:19.869
in that we support the patient
to experience whatever's emerging

00:10:19.893 --> 00:10:22.069
within their minds or their bodies.

00:10:23.361 --> 00:10:25.561
Even with MDMA, this is hard work.

00:10:26.077 --> 00:10:28.099
And a lot of our subjects have said,

00:10:28.123 --> 00:10:30.418
"I don't know why they call this Ecstasy."

00:10:30.442 --> 00:10:31.994
(Laughter)

00:10:32.435 --> 00:10:34.848
During Tony's first MDMA session,

00:10:34.872 --> 00:10:37.514
he lay on the couch, he had eyeshades on,

00:10:37.538 --> 00:10:39.705
he listened to music,

00:10:39.729 --> 00:10:41.545
and he would speak to the therapists,

00:10:41.569 --> 00:10:43.470
who were a male-female co-therapy team,

00:10:43.494 --> 00:10:45.998
whenever he felt that he needed to.

00:10:46.022 --> 00:10:47.331
After several hours,

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:50.418
in a moment of calmness and clarity,

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:53.990
Tony shared that he had realized

00:10:54.014 --> 00:10:59.664
his PTSD was a way
of connecting him to his friends.

00:10:59.688 --> 00:11:03.513
It was a way of honoring the memory
of his friends who had died.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.585
But he was able to shift and see himself
through the eyes of his dead friends.

00:11:08.609 --> 00:11:11.361
And he realized that they
would not want him to suffer,

00:11:11.385 --> 00:11:12.633
to squander his life.

00:11:12.657 --> 00:11:14.529
They would want him to live more fully,

00:11:14.553 --> 00:11:16.330
which they were unable to do.

00:11:16.354 --> 00:11:20.385
And so he realized that there was
a new way to honor their memory,

00:11:20.409 --> 00:11:22.797
which was to live as fully as possible.

00:11:23.822 --> 00:11:26.940
He also realized that
he was telling himself a story

00:11:26.964 --> 00:11:29.331
that he was taking opiates for pain.

00:11:29.355 --> 00:11:32.302
But actually, he realized,
he was taking them for escape.

00:11:32.643 --> 00:11:35.514
So he decided he didn't need
the opiates anymore,

00:11:35.538 --> 00:11:37.300
he didn't need the MDMA anymore,

00:11:37.324 --> 00:11:39.149
and he was dropping out of the study.

00:11:39.752 --> 00:11:41.299
That was seven years ago.

00:11:41.323 --> 00:11:43.537
Tony is still free of PTSD,

00:11:43.561 --> 00:11:46.117
has never returned to opiates

00:11:46.141 --> 00:11:50.264
and is helping others less fortunate
than himself in Cambodia.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:55.527
(Applause)

00:11:55.551 --> 00:11:58.161
The data that we presented to FDA

00:11:58.185 --> 00:12:01.367
from 107 people in our pilot
studies, including Tony,

00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:07.159
showed that 23 percent of the people
that received therapy without active MDMA

00:12:07.183 --> 00:12:10.214
no longer had PTSD
at the end of treatment.

00:12:10.238 --> 00:12:13.347
This is really pretty good
for this patient population.

00:12:13.371 --> 00:12:15.672
However, when you add MDMA,

00:12:15.696 --> 00:12:20.292
the results more than double,
to 56 percent no longer having PTSD.

00:12:21.175 --> 00:12:24.611
(Applause)

00:12:24.635 --> 00:12:25.873
But most importantly,

00:12:25.897 --> 00:12:29.045
once people learn that if they don't need
to suppress their trauma,

00:12:29.069 --> 00:12:30.704
but they can process it,

00:12:30.728 --> 00:12:32.807
they keep getting better on their own.

00:12:32.831 --> 00:12:36.782
So at the 12-month follow-up
one year after the last treatment session,

00:12:36.806 --> 00:12:39.871
two-thirds no longer have PTSD.

00:12:39.895 --> 00:12:41.656
And of the one-third that do,

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.974
many have clinically significant
reductions in symptoms.

00:12:45.347 --> 00:12:48.743
(Applause)

00:12:49.552 --> 00:12:51.355
On the basis of this data,

00:12:51.379 --> 00:12:55.926
the FDA has declared MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy for PTSD

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:57.416
a breakthrough therapy.

00:12:57.782 --> 00:13:01.101
FDA has also declared psilocybin
a breakthrough therapy

00:13:01.125 --> 00:13:03.107
for treatment-resistant depression

00:13:03.131 --> 00:13:06.734
and just recently approved
esketamine for depression.

00:13:08.972 --> 00:13:13.955
I'm proud to say that we have now
initiated our Phase 3 studies.

00:13:14.631 --> 00:13:17.401
And if the results are as we hope,

00:13:17.425 --> 00:13:19.680
and if they're similar
to the Phase 2 studies,

00:13:19.704 --> 00:13:25.307
by the end of 2021, FDA will approve
MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD.

00:13:25.927 --> 00:13:27.078
If approved,

00:13:27.102 --> 00:13:31.139
the only therapists who will be able
to directly administer it to patients

00:13:31.163 --> 00:13:34.530
are going to be therapists that
have been through our training program,

00:13:34.554 --> 00:13:36.745
and they will only be able
to administer MDMA

00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:39.757
under direct supervision
in clinic settings.

00:13:41.157 --> 00:13:45.213
We anticipate that over
the next several decades,

00:13:45.237 --> 00:13:48.213
there will be thousands
of psychedelic clinics established,

00:13:48.237 --> 00:13:51.999
at which, therapists will be able
to administer MDMA,

00:13:52.023 --> 00:13:55.149
psilocybin, ketamine
and other psychedelics

00:13:55.173 --> 00:13:58.148
to potentially millions of patients.

00:13:58.609 --> 00:14:03.280
These clinics can also evolve
into centers where people can come

00:14:03.304 --> 00:14:06.311
for psychedelic psychotherapy
for personal growth,

00:14:06.335 --> 00:14:08.248
for couples therapy

00:14:08.272 --> 00:14:11.573
or for spiritual, mystical experiences.

00:14:12.924 --> 00:14:19.884
Humanity now is in a race
between catastrophe and consciousness.

00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:25.624
The psychedelic renaissance is here
to help consciousness triumph.

00:14:26.243 --> 00:14:29.731
And now, if you all just
look under your seats ...

00:14:30.243 --> 00:14:31.402
Just joking!

00:14:31.426 --> 00:14:32.584
(Laughter)

00:14:32.608 --> 00:14:33.782
Thank you.

00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:35.569
(Applause)

00:14:35.593 --> 00:14:36.751
(Laughter)

00:14:36.775 --> 00:14:41.768
(Applause)

00:14:41.792 --> 00:14:42.958
Thank you.

00:14:42.982 --> 00:14:47.157
(Applause)

00:14:48.014 --> 00:14:50.826
Corey Hajim: You've got to stay
up here for a minute.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.458
Thank you so much, Rick.

00:14:52.482 --> 00:14:54.426
I guess it's a supportive audience.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:55.757
Rick Doblin: Yes, very.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.903
Many of them have also
been to Burning Man.

00:14:59.927 --> 00:15:01.077
(Laughter)

00:15:01.514 --> 00:15:03.220
CH: There's some synergy.

00:15:03.244 --> 00:15:04.397
RD: (Laughs)

00:15:04.421 --> 00:15:08.522
CH: So, in your talk, you talked
about using these drugs

00:15:08.546 --> 00:15:10.965
to address some pretty serious traumas.

00:15:10.989 --> 00:15:14.014
So what about some more common
mental illnesses

00:15:14.038 --> 00:15:15.776
like anxiety and depression,

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.403
and is that where microdosing comes in?

00:15:18.427 --> 00:15:21.180
RD: Well, microdosing
can be helpful for depression,

00:15:21.204 --> 00:15:23.561
I do know someone that has been using it.

00:15:23.585 --> 00:15:26.712
But in general, for therapeutic purposes,

00:15:26.736 --> 00:15:29.799
we prefer macro-dosing
rather than microdosing,

00:15:29.823 --> 00:15:32.577
in order to really help people
deal with the root causes.

00:15:32.601 --> 00:15:35.109
Microdosing is more for creativity,

00:15:35.133 --> 00:15:37.127
for artistic inspiration,

00:15:37.151 --> 00:15:38.463
for focus ...

00:15:38.918 --> 00:15:42.312
And it also does have
a mood-elevation lift.

00:15:42.336 --> 00:15:43.958
But I think for serious illnesses,

00:15:43.982 --> 00:15:47.037
we'd rather not get people thinking
that they need a daily drug,

00:15:47.061 --> 00:15:49.434
but do more deeper, intense work.

00:15:49.458 --> 00:15:53.333
CH: And what about outside
the United States and North America,

00:15:53.357 --> 00:15:55.037
is this research being done there?

00:15:55.061 --> 00:15:57.288
RD: Oh yeah, we're globalizing.

00:15:57.974 --> 00:16:00.260
Our Phase 3 studies
are actually being done

00:16:00.284 --> 00:16:02.697
in Israel, Canada and the United States.

00:16:02.721 --> 00:16:04.349
So once we get approval in FDA,

00:16:04.373 --> 00:16:07.705
it will also become approved
in Israel and in Canada.

00:16:07.729 --> 00:16:10.903
We're just starting research in Europe.

00:16:10.927 --> 00:16:15.010
And we're actually going to be training
some therapists from China.

00:16:15.506 --> 00:16:16.657
CH: That's great.

00:16:16.681 --> 00:16:18.412
We were going to do an audience vote

00:16:18.436 --> 00:16:20.658
to see if people felt
like this was a good idea

00:16:20.682 --> 00:16:22.697
to move forward with this research or not,

00:16:22.721 --> 00:16:25.942
but I have a feeling I know
the answer to that, so ...

00:16:25.966 --> 00:16:27.119
Thank you so much, Rick.

00:16:27.143 --> 00:16:28.547
RD: Thank you. Thank you all.

00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:30.614
(Applause)
