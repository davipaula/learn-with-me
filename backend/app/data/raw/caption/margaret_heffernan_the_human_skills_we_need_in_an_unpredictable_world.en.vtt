00:00:12.731 --> 00:00:16.337
Recently, the leadership team
of an American supermarket chain

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:19.817
decided that their business
needed to get a lot more efficient.

00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:23.696
So they embraced their digital
transformation with zeal.

00:00:24.174 --> 00:00:28.122
Out went the teams
supervising meat, veg, bakery,

00:00:28.146 --> 00:00:32.302
and in came an algorithmic task allocator.

00:00:32.914 --> 00:00:35.017
Now, instead of people working together,

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:39.282
each employee went, clocked in,
got assigned a task, did it,

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:40.884
came back for more.

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:45.156
This was scientific
management on steroids,

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.262
standardizing and allocating work.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.670
It was super efficient.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.116
Well, not quite,

00:00:53.351 --> 00:00:55.677
because the task allocator didn't know

00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:58.623
when a customer was going
to drop a box of eggs,

00:00:58.647 --> 00:01:02.496
couldn't predict when some crazy kid
was going to knock over a display,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.436
or when the local high school decided

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.095
that everybody needed
to bring in coconuts the next day.

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.119
(Laughter)

00:01:08.143 --> 00:01:10.280
Efficiency works really well

00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:13.343
when you can predict
exactly what you're going to need.

00:01:13.815 --> 00:01:17.091
But when the anomalous
or unexpected comes along --

00:01:17.115 --> 00:01:19.447
kids, customers, coconuts --

00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:22.344
well, then efficiency
is no longer your friend.

00:01:24.074 --> 00:01:26.191
This has become a really crucial issue,

00:01:26.215 --> 00:01:28.833
this ability to deal with the unexpected,

00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:33.228
because the unexpected
is becoming the norm.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.737
It's why experts and forecasters
are reluctant to predict anything

00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:40.333
more than 400 days out.

00:01:41.054 --> 00:01:42.500
Why?

00:01:42.524 --> 00:01:44.448
Because over the last 20 or 30 years,

00:01:44.472 --> 00:01:48.282
much of the world has gone
from being complicated

00:01:48.306 --> 00:01:49.602
to being complex --

00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:52.714
which means that yes, there are patterns,

00:01:52.738 --> 00:01:55.034
but they don't repeat
themselves regularly.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.728
It means that very small changes
can make a disproportionate impact.

00:02:00.244 --> 00:02:02.910
And it means that expertise
won't always suffice,

00:02:02.934 --> 00:02:06.568
because the system
just keeps changing too fast.

00:02:08.192 --> 00:02:10.824
So what that means

00:02:10.848 --> 00:02:13.735
is that there's a huge amount in the world

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.749
that kind of defies forecasting now.

00:02:16.773 --> 00:02:20.603
It's why the Bank of England will say
yes, there will be another crash,

00:02:20.627 --> 00:02:23.057
but we don't know why or when.

00:02:23.807 --> 00:02:26.423
We know that climate change is real,

00:02:26.447 --> 00:02:29.523
but we can't predict
where forest fires will break out,

00:02:29.547 --> 00:02:32.797
and we don't know which factories
are going to flood.

00:02:33.313 --> 00:02:36.004
It's why companies are blindsided

00:02:36.028 --> 00:02:40.897
when plastic straws
and bags and bottled water

00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:44.226
go from staples to rejects overnight,

00:02:45.488 --> 00:02:49.060
and baffled when a change in social mores

00:02:49.084 --> 00:02:53.624
turns stars into pariahs
and colleagues into outcasts:

00:02:55.155 --> 00:02:58.209
ineradicable uncertainty.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.655
In an environment that defies
so much forecasting,

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:06.883
efficiency won't just not help us,

00:03:06.907 --> 00:03:13.861
it specifically undermines and erodes
our capacity to adapt and respond.

00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:19.196
So if efficiency is no longer
our guiding principle,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.968
how should we address the future?

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:23.444
What kind of thinking
is really going to help us?

00:03:23.468 --> 00:03:28.615
What sort of talents
must we be sure to defend?

00:03:29.601 --> 00:03:34.486
I think that, where in the past we used to
think a lot about just in time management,

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.394
now we have to start thinking
about just in case,

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:41.815
preparing for events
that are generally certain

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:44.382
but specifically remain ambiguous.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.308
One example of this is the Coalition
for Epidemic Preparedness, CEPI.

00:03:50.332 --> 00:03:54.428
We know there will be
more epidemics in future,

00:03:54.452 --> 00:03:58.338
but we don't know where or when or what.

00:03:58.362 --> 00:04:00.303
So we can't plan.

00:04:00.942 --> 00:04:02.593
But we can prepare.

00:04:03.257 --> 00:04:09.025
So CEPI's developing multiple vaccines
for multiple diseases,

00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:13.413
knowing that they can't predict
which vaccines are going to work

00:04:13.437 --> 00:04:15.457
or which diseases will break out.

00:04:15.481 --> 00:04:18.454
So some of those vaccines
will never be used.

00:04:18.478 --> 00:04:19.950
That's inefficient.

00:04:20.794 --> 00:04:22.705
But it's robust,

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.664
because it provides more options,

00:04:24.688 --> 00:04:29.698
and it means that we don't depend
on a single technological solution.

00:04:30.566 --> 00:04:33.934
Epidemic responsiveness
also depends hugely

00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:36.875
on people who know and trust each other.

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:39.686
But those relationships
take time to develop,

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.935
time that is always in short supply
when an epidemic breaks out.

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:49.047
So CEPI is developing relationships,
friendships, alliances now

00:04:50.197 --> 00:04:53.393
knowing that some of those
may never be used.

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.102
That's inefficient,
a waste of time, perhaps,

00:04:57.126 --> 00:04:58.420
but it's robust.

00:04:59.161 --> 00:05:02.966
You can see robust thinking
in financial services, too.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.744
In the past, banks used to hold
much less capital

00:05:06.768 --> 00:05:08.991
than they're required to today,

00:05:09.015 --> 00:05:12.756
because holding so little capital,
being too efficient with it,

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.930
is what made the banks
so fragile in the first place.

00:05:16.581 --> 00:05:22.070
Now, holding more capital
looks and is inefficient.

00:05:22.094 --> 00:05:28.147
But it's robust, because it protects
the financial system against surprises.

00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:32.072
Countries that are really serious
about climate change

00:05:32.096 --> 00:05:35.650
know that they have to adopt
multiple solutions,

00:05:35.674 --> 00:05:38.702
multiple forms of renewable energy,

00:05:38.726 --> 00:05:40.055
not just one.

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:44.939
The countries that are most advanced
have been working for years now,

00:05:44.963 --> 00:05:48.629
changing their water and food supply
and healthcare systems,

00:05:48.653 --> 00:05:53.265
because they recognize that by the time
they have certain prediction,

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.600
that information may very well
come too late.

00:05:57.458 --> 00:06:01.914
You can take the same approach
to trade wars, and many countries do.

00:06:01.938 --> 00:06:05.761
Instead of depending on a single
huge trading partner,

00:06:05.785 --> 00:06:07.889
they try to be everybody's friends,

00:06:07.913 --> 00:06:10.251
because they know they can't predict

00:06:10.275 --> 00:06:14.029
which markets might
suddenly become unstable.

00:06:14.053 --> 00:06:18.290
It's time-consuming and expensive,
negotiating all these deals,

00:06:18.314 --> 00:06:19.472
but it's robust

00:06:19.496 --> 00:06:24.907
because it makes their whole economy
better defended against shocks.

00:06:24.931 --> 00:06:28.610
It's particularly a strategy
adopted by small countries

00:06:28.634 --> 00:06:32.720
that know they'll never have
the market muscle to call the shots,

00:06:32.744 --> 00:06:35.898
so it's just better to have
too many friends.

00:06:37.922 --> 00:06:40.329
But if you're stuck
in one of these organizations

00:06:40.353 --> 00:06:45.248
that's still kind of captured
by the efficiency myth,

00:06:45.272 --> 00:06:47.034
how do you start to change it?

00:06:48.011 --> 00:06:49.567
Try some experiments.

00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:51.787
In the Netherlands,

00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:56.525
home care nursing used to be run
pretty much like the supermarket:

00:06:56.549 --> 00:06:59.327
standardized and prescribed work

00:06:59.351 --> 00:07:01.119
to the minute:

00:07:01.143 --> 00:07:04.799
nine minutes on Monday,
seven minutes on Wednesday,

00:07:04.823 --> 00:07:06.537
eight minutes on Friday.

00:07:06.561 --> 00:07:08.943
The nurses hated it.

00:07:08.967 --> 00:07:11.339
So one of them, Jos de Blok,

00:07:11.363 --> 00:07:12.944
proposed an experiment.

00:07:13.564 --> 00:07:15.196
Since every patient is different,

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.634
and we don't quite know
exactly what they'll need,

00:07:17.658 --> 00:07:20.345
why don't we just leave it
to the nurses to decide?

00:07:21.267 --> 00:07:22.637
Sound reckless?

00:07:22.661 --> 00:07:24.056
(Laughter)

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.200
(Applause)

00:07:26.224 --> 00:07:30.358
In his experiment, Jos found
the patients got better

00:07:30.382 --> 00:07:32.911
in half the time,

00:07:32.935 --> 00:07:36.614
and costs fell by 30 percent.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.132
When I asked Jos what had surprised him
about his experiment,

00:07:42.156 --> 00:07:43.949
he just kind of laughed and he said,

00:07:43.973 --> 00:07:47.165
"Well, I had no idea it could be so easy

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:49.779
to find such a huge improvement,

00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:53.426
because this isn't the kind of thing
you can know or predict

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:56.280
sitting at a desk
or staring at a computer screen."

00:07:56.734 --> 00:08:00.508
So now this form of nursing
has proliferated across the Netherlands

00:08:00.532 --> 00:08:02.266
and around the world.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.510
But in every new country
it still starts with experiments,

00:08:05.534 --> 00:08:10.392
because each place is slightly
and unpredictably different.

00:08:11.246 --> 00:08:15.196
Of course, not all experiments work.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.276
Jos tried a similar approach
to the fire service

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.837
and found it didn't work because
the service is just too centralized.

00:08:21.861 --> 00:08:24.424
Failed experiments look inefficient,

00:08:24.448 --> 00:08:27.631
but they're often the only way
you can figure out

00:08:27.655 --> 00:08:29.929
how the real world works.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.313
So now he's trying teachers.

00:08:34.746 --> 00:08:38.493
Experiments like that require creativity

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:40.824
and not a little bravery.

00:08:41.613 --> 00:08:43.176
In England --

00:08:43.978 --> 00:08:46.883
I was about to say in the UK,
but in England --

00:08:46.907 --> 00:08:48.649
(Laughter)

00:08:48.673 --> 00:08:52.987
(Applause)

00:08:53.363 --> 00:08:57.449
In England, the leading rugby team,
or one of the leading rugby teams,

00:08:57.473 --> 00:08:58.833
is Saracens.

00:08:59.299 --> 00:09:04.364
The manager and the coach there realized
that all the physical training they do

00:09:04.388 --> 00:09:07.102
and the data-driven
conditioning that they do

00:09:07.126 --> 00:09:08.280
has become generic;

00:09:08.304 --> 00:09:11.094
really, all the teams
do exactly the same thing.

00:09:11.683 --> 00:09:14.015
So they risked an experiment.

00:09:14.039 --> 00:09:18.284
They took the whole team away,
even in match season,

00:09:18.308 --> 00:09:19.723
on ski trips

00:09:19.747 --> 00:09:23.041
and to look at social projects in Chicago.

00:09:23.065 --> 00:09:24.591
This was expensive,

00:09:24.615 --> 00:09:26.567
it was time-consuming,

00:09:26.591 --> 00:09:28.272
and it could be a little risky

00:09:28.296 --> 00:09:32.070
putting a whole bunch of rugby players
on a ski slope, right?

00:09:32.094 --> 00:09:33.141
(Laughter)

00:09:33.165 --> 00:09:36.509
But what they found was that
the players came back

00:09:36.533 --> 00:09:41.799
with renewed bonds
of loyalty and solidarity.

00:09:41.823 --> 00:09:45.232
And now when they're on the pitch
under incredible pressure,

00:09:45.256 --> 00:09:49.682
they manifest what the manager
calls "poise" --

00:09:50.515 --> 00:09:54.674
an unflinching, unwavering dedication

00:09:54.698 --> 00:09:56.173
to each other.

00:09:56.824 --> 00:10:00.577
Their opponents are in awe of this,

00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:04.753
but still too in thrall
to efficiency to try it.

00:10:05.783 --> 00:10:07.815
At a London tech company, Verve,

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:11.182
the CEO measures just about
everything that moves,

00:10:11.206 --> 00:10:14.230
but she couldn't find anything
that made any difference

00:10:14.254 --> 00:10:16.381
to the company's productivity.

00:10:16.405 --> 00:10:20.160
So she devised an experiment
that she calls "Love Week":

00:10:20.184 --> 00:10:24.721
a whole week where each employee
has to look for really clever,

00:10:24.745 --> 00:10:27.024
helpful, imaginative things

00:10:27.048 --> 00:10:28.848
that a counterpart does,

00:10:28.872 --> 00:10:31.336
call it out and celebrate it.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.477
It takes a huge amount of time and effort;

00:10:33.501 --> 00:10:36.538
lots of people would call it distracting.

00:10:36.562 --> 00:10:38.794
But it really energizes the business

00:10:38.818 --> 00:10:42.456
and makes the whole company
more productive.

00:10:44.048 --> 00:10:47.354
Preparedness, coalition-building,

00:10:47.378 --> 00:10:50.960
imagination, experiments,

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:52.151
bravery --

00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:54.625
in an unpredictable age,

00:10:54.649 --> 00:11:00.317
these are tremendous sources
of resilience and strength.

00:11:00.673 --> 00:11:03.241
They aren't efficient,

00:11:04.278 --> 00:11:06.947
but they give us limitless capacity

00:11:06.971 --> 00:11:11.466
for adaptation, variation and invention.

00:11:12.284 --> 00:11:14.706
And the less we know about the future,

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:20.132
the more we're going to need
these tremendous sources

00:11:20.156 --> 00:11:25.777
of human, messy, unpredictable skills.

00:11:27.336 --> 00:11:31.396
But in our growing
dependence on technology,

00:11:32.318 --> 00:11:35.668
we're asset-stripping those skills.

00:11:36.642 --> 00:11:40.207
Every time we use technology

00:11:40.231 --> 00:11:44.423
to nudge us through a decision or a choice

00:11:44.447 --> 00:11:46.761
or to interpret how somebody's feeling

00:11:46.785 --> 00:11:48.962
or to guide us through a conversation,

00:11:48.986 --> 00:11:54.100
we outsource to a machine
what we could, can do ourselves,

00:11:54.124 --> 00:11:56.648
and it's an expensive trade-off.

00:11:57.847 --> 00:12:00.749
The more we let machines think for us,

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.649
the less we can think for ourselves.

00:12:05.661 --> 00:12:06.814
The more --

00:12:06.838 --> 00:12:11.408
(Applause)

00:12:11.432 --> 00:12:16.153
The more time doctors spend
staring at digital medical records,

00:12:16.177 --> 00:12:19.563
the less time they spend
looking at their patients.

00:12:20.325 --> 00:12:23.113
The more we use parenting apps,

00:12:23.137 --> 00:12:25.294
the less we know our kids.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:31.396
The more time we spend with people that
we're predicted and programmed to like,

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.130
the less we can connect with people
who are different from ourselves.

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:40.181
And the less compassion we need,
the less compassion we have.

00:12:41.825 --> 00:12:45.359
What all of these
technologies attempt to do

00:12:45.383 --> 00:12:52.180
is to force-fit a standardized model
of a predictable reality

00:12:52.204 --> 00:12:55.572
onto a world that is
infinitely surprising.

00:12:56.926 --> 00:12:58.278
What gets left out?

00:12:58.965 --> 00:13:01.568
Anything that can't be measured --

00:13:02.451 --> 00:13:04.810
which is just about
everything that counts.

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:12.775
(Applause)

00:13:14.854 --> 00:13:18.941
Our growing dependence on technology

00:13:18.965 --> 00:13:22.738
risks us becoming less skilled,

00:13:22.762 --> 00:13:24.357
more vulnerable

00:13:24.381 --> 00:13:27.332
to the deep and growing complexity

00:13:27.356 --> 00:13:28.729
of the real world.

00:13:29.951 --> 00:13:35.335
Now, as I was thinking about
the extremes of stress and turbulence

00:13:35.359 --> 00:13:38.015
that we know we will have to confront,

00:13:39.412 --> 00:13:42.364
I went and I talked to
a number of chief executives

00:13:42.388 --> 00:13:46.556
whose own businesses had gone
through existential crises,

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.468
when they teetered
on the brink of collapse.

00:13:50.594 --> 00:13:55.402
These were frank,
gut-wrenching conversations.

00:13:56.302 --> 00:13:59.579
Many men wept just remembering.

00:14:00.214 --> 00:14:01.728
So I asked them:

00:14:02.603 --> 00:14:04.668
"What kept you going through this?"

00:14:05.328 --> 00:14:07.982
And they all had exactly the same answer.

00:14:08.006 --> 00:14:11.116
"It wasn't data or technology," they said.

00:14:11.926 --> 00:14:15.311
"It was my friends and my colleagues

00:14:15.335 --> 00:14:16.671
who kept me going."

00:14:17.173 --> 00:14:22.488
One added, "It was pretty much
the opposite of the gig economy."

00:14:24.056 --> 00:14:27.790
But then I went and I talked to a group
of young, rising executives,

00:14:27.814 --> 00:14:29.621
and I asked them,

00:14:29.645 --> 00:14:31.187
"Who are your friends at work?"

00:14:31.211 --> 00:14:32.989
And they just looked blank.

00:14:33.765 --> 00:14:35.615
"There's no time."

00:14:35.639 --> 00:14:37.448
"They're too busy."

00:14:37.472 --> 00:14:38.910
"It's not efficient."

00:14:39.906 --> 00:14:43.478
Who, I wondered, is going to give them

00:14:43.502 --> 00:14:48.041
imagination and stamina and bravery

00:14:48.065 --> 00:14:49.581
when the storms come?

00:14:51.694 --> 00:14:55.337
Anyone who tries to tell you
that they know the future

00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:57.559
is just trying to own it,

00:14:57.583 --> 00:15:00.891
a spurious kind of manifest destiny.

00:15:01.794 --> 00:15:04.115
The harder, deeper truth is

00:15:05.126 --> 00:15:07.535
that the future is uncharted,

00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:09.803
that we can't map it till we get there.

00:15:10.734 --> 00:15:12.797
But that's OK,

00:15:12.821 --> 00:15:15.838
because we have so much imagination --

00:15:15.862 --> 00:15:17.309
if we use it.

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:22.810
We have deep talents
of inventiveness and exploration --

00:15:22.834 --> 00:15:24.611
if we apply them.

00:15:24.635 --> 00:15:30.152
We are brave enough to invent things
we've never seen before.

00:15:31.175 --> 00:15:32.790
Lose those skills,

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.532
and we are adrift.

00:15:36.384 --> 00:15:39.109
But hone and develop them,

00:15:40.498 --> 00:15:42.956
we can make any future we choose.

00:15:44.382 --> 00:15:45.556
Thank you.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:51.666
(Applause)
