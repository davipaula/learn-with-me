00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:26.594
If we still lived as hunters and gatherers
on wild plums and animals alone,

00:00:26.594 --> 00:00:31.194
then there would be only
about 25 million people on earth today.

00:00:31.194 --> 00:00:34.110
Now the population is over seven billion,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.543
which is due to a change in our way
of life from over 10,000 years ago.

00:00:39.303 --> 00:00:41.925
Some of your and my ancestors
saw the potential

00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:46.605
in certain wild plants and animals
and started domesticating them.

00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:49.638
This happened through
continuous cultivation

00:00:49.638 --> 00:00:53.979
and selection of those plants
with a special capacity -

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:59.079
only a small part of wild plants
and animals can be domesticated at all.

00:00:59.742 --> 00:01:02.195
Let's have a look
at this plant, for example.

00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:06.274
Isn't it amazing
that out of this wild cabbage,

00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:10.944
kale, cauliflower and all the other
cabbage varieties were developed?

00:01:11.744 --> 00:01:16.230
This development into a culture plant
did, of course, not happen overnight

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.590
but took thousands of years,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.820
and it took several hundreds
of generations of humans.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.352
That's why they are
a real cultural heritage,

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:29.582
just like the Eiffel Tower
or a Van Gogh painting.

00:01:30.212 --> 00:01:33.847
So, maybe the next time
you bite into a cauliflower,

00:01:33.847 --> 00:01:37.241
be aware that you're eating
a kind of Mona Lisa.

00:01:37.241 --> 00:01:39.441
(Laughter)

00:01:39.441 --> 00:01:44.181
Through domestication process,
a huge diversity arose.

00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:46.660
For almost every part of the world,

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.330
species and varieties that fit
the special conditions were found.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.116
In Switzerland, for example,

00:01:53.116 --> 00:01:56.766
there were distinct varieties
in almost every village,

00:01:56.766 --> 00:02:00.597
like the KÃ¼ttiger carrot
or the Uster apple.

00:02:02.297 --> 00:02:08.327
I like to watch the reactions of people
at exhibitions of traditional varieties.

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:11.075
It is clearly split by age.

00:02:11.075 --> 00:02:12.346
Older the people say,

00:02:12.346 --> 00:02:15.946
'Oh, I remember this variety
from my grandmother's garden.'

00:02:16.506 --> 00:02:18.794
And younger people, they are just amazed

00:02:18.794 --> 00:02:22.333
and say, 'I didn't know
there were so many different ones',

00:02:22.333 --> 00:02:25.055
and then they take out their phone
and take a picture.

00:02:25.055 --> 00:02:26.982
(Laughter)

00:02:26.982 --> 00:02:32.010
But apart from being a cultural heritage
or simply being beautiful,

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.184
do we really need this much diversity?

00:02:35.484 --> 00:02:39.965
Would not one single variety
of each crop be enough?

00:02:42.835 --> 00:02:47.175
What happens if a population depends
too much on a single variety

00:02:47.175 --> 00:02:51.322
was highlighted in Ireland
in the mid 19th century.

00:02:51.322 --> 00:02:55.912
The Irish were mostly cultivating
a potato variety called the Lumper.

00:02:56.412 --> 00:03:01.764
Potatoes of the same variety are clones
and thus genetically identical.

00:03:02.094 --> 00:03:04.724
So when a new disease arrived
with the potato blight,

00:03:04.724 --> 00:03:06.804
it had a very easy game,

00:03:06.804 --> 00:03:10.584
and it destroyed the crops
in consecutive years.

00:03:10.584 --> 00:03:13.956
The sad consequence was
that about a million people died,

00:03:13.956 --> 00:03:17.586
and one and a half million Irish
had to emigrate.

00:03:18.556 --> 00:03:23.356
We can see from this that nature
does not agree with monocultures,

00:03:23.356 --> 00:03:27.208
as they can be easily wiped out
by a single disease.

00:03:27.208 --> 00:03:33.138
The natives in South America, for example,
do not grow only one single potato variety

00:03:33.138 --> 00:03:35.081
but many, many different ones.

00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:38.111
Like this, they always have a yield,

00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:43.537
as the varieties differ in their reaction
to pests and drier or wetter years.

00:03:43.537 --> 00:03:48.107
A more current example to show
that monocultures are only short living

00:03:48.107 --> 00:03:49.589
is the banana.

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.779
It may well be that in a few years,
you will not be able to eat one anymore.

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:59.237
The trade relies to 95 percent
on a single variety

00:03:59.237 --> 00:04:01.860
which is grown on large plantations.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.079
These are now threatened
by the Panama disease.

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:09.425
There is no other variety
to replace it at the moment.

00:04:09.985 --> 00:04:13.255
And to make my point
for diversity very clear,

00:04:13.255 --> 00:04:16.320
let's look at it from
a completely different angle.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.263
If you were so lucky to be a millionaire,

00:04:19.263 --> 00:04:22.023
you would not put all your money
on the same stock,

00:04:22.023 --> 00:04:23.862
but you would diversify

00:04:23.862 --> 00:04:27.422
because the risk
of losing everything is too big.

00:04:28.182 --> 00:04:30.402
But, in agriculture,

00:04:30.402 --> 00:04:33.342
instead of diversifying
and minimising the risk,

00:04:33.342 --> 00:04:35.978
what we are doing is the exact opposite.

00:04:36.618 --> 00:04:41.718
And this funnel represents
the concentration which is taking place

00:04:41.718 --> 00:04:43.509
at every level.

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:49.479
Firstly, it represents the people
working in agriculture.

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:55.586
At the beginning of the 20th century,
it was 60 percent of the population.

00:04:55.586 --> 00:04:58.714
Now, it is down to three percent.

00:04:59.574 --> 00:05:02.294
And it stands for the seed companies.

00:05:02.294 --> 00:05:06.447
In 1970, there were 7,000 companies,

00:05:06.447 --> 00:05:10.787
and none had a market share of over 0.5%.

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:15.578
Now, the top five
hold 60 percent of the market.

00:05:16.688 --> 00:05:21.467
And it stands for
the huge loss in diversity.

00:05:22.327 --> 00:05:24.613
In the last 150 years,

00:05:24.613 --> 00:05:31.167
we lost 75 percent of all varieties
ever selected by humans.

00:05:31.437 --> 00:05:33.228
They have gone forever.

00:05:34.088 --> 00:05:39.618
One reason for this huge loss
is the industrialisation of every culture

00:05:39.618 --> 00:05:43.488
and with it the appearance
of modern hybrid seeds.

00:05:43.488 --> 00:05:47.768
For farmers and gardeners,
hybrid seeds are a dead end

00:05:47.768 --> 00:05:51.756
because they do not stay true to type
when you take the seeds.

00:05:52.396 --> 00:05:54.545
You have to buy them every year,

00:05:54.545 --> 00:05:56.979
and thus, they are an extremely
good business model,

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.326
as you have to rely on the companies.

00:06:00.066 --> 00:06:03.386
Traditional varieties, on the other hand,

00:06:03.386 --> 00:06:07.499
can be regrown by everybody
who wants to, year after year,

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:10.079
by saving your own seeds.

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.695
With traditional varieties,
many ways are possible,

00:06:14.695 --> 00:06:17.154
and this is what makes them powerful.

00:06:17.154 --> 00:06:21.896
They can be the base for a more
sustainable agricultural future.

00:06:22.876 --> 00:06:28.006
We do not know what challenges lie ahead
and what new traits will be necessary,

00:06:28.006 --> 00:06:30.890
but the more diversity
we can safeguard now,

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.302
the better the chances are

00:06:32.302 --> 00:06:36.382
that we will have the suitable varieties 
at hand for the future.

00:06:37.712 --> 00:06:42.752
And that is why I would like
this funnel to be reversed again.

00:06:42.752 --> 00:06:48.738
With urban gardening and farming
and community supported agriculture,

00:06:48.738 --> 00:06:51.803
reversing this process
has already started.

00:06:51.803 --> 00:06:55.826
And that is why we
from the ProSpecieRara Foundation

00:06:55.826 --> 00:07:00.206
try to save as many different
traditional varieties as possible.

00:07:00.696 --> 00:07:06.421
At the moment we're safeguarding
1,600 different vegetable varieties

00:07:06.421 --> 00:07:12.000
in our seed library here in Basel,
and the number is still growing.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.044
We think it's important
to sow the seeds every year

00:07:15.044 --> 00:07:18.424
so that they can adapt
to changing environment.

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:22.264
We would need a very large garden
to be able to do so,

00:07:22.264 --> 00:07:26.934
but fortunately, we have the help
of over 500 volunteers

00:07:26.934 --> 00:07:32.546
who grow the varieties in their own garden
and then send the saved seeds back to us.

00:07:32.546 --> 00:07:37.311
Without them, our work and that
of other seed saving organisations

00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:39.111
would not be possible.

00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:44.361
You can also be part
in reversing this process.

00:07:46.022 --> 00:07:49.798
To be honest, seed saving
is quite difficult with most crops,

00:07:49.798 --> 00:07:51.908
but some are rather easy.

00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:56.414
Tomatoes, for example, are very simple
and very rewarding.

00:07:56.414 --> 00:08:00.595
Have you ever eaten a sun-ripe tomato
fresh from the plant?

00:08:00.595 --> 00:08:04.875
The taste of it excels 
that of the supermarket type by far.

00:08:05.295 --> 00:08:08.347
And instead of eating
only red and round ones,

00:08:08.347 --> 00:08:13.607
you can choose from a huge variety
in color, shape and size.

00:08:13.866 --> 00:08:16.607
I'm sure you would find one
that suits you.

00:08:17.257 --> 00:08:20.711
All you need is a sunny spot
on your balcony

00:08:20.711 --> 00:08:22.206
or in front of your house,

00:08:22.206 --> 00:08:25.134
a pot, earth and water.

00:08:25.134 --> 00:08:28.814
When a tomato is ripe,
the seeds are ripe as well.

00:08:28.814 --> 00:08:32.261
So if you want to get the seeds
from a very good variety,

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:36.753
you just put the seeds in a glass
and let them sit for one or two days.

00:08:36.753 --> 00:08:39.050
Then you rinse them and let them dry.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.823
As nature is abundant,
you will get a large amount of seeds,

00:08:42.823 --> 00:08:45.164
which you can share
with your friends and family

00:08:45.164 --> 00:08:47.610
and resow next spring.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.114
By sowing and sharing them,
you will keep a link alive

00:08:52.114 --> 00:08:56.122
to what your and my ancestors
have been doing for thousands of years,

00:08:56.122 --> 00:08:58.491
and bring it into the future.

00:08:58.791 --> 00:09:00.881
I hope you will give it a try.

00:09:01.161 --> 00:09:02.181
Thank you.

00:09:02.181 --> 00:09:04.261
(Applause)
