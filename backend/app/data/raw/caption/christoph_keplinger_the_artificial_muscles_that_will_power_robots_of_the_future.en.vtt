00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:17.018
In 2015, 25 teams from around the world

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:19.768
competed to build robots
for disaster response

00:00:19.792 --> 00:00:21.643
that could perform a number of tasks,

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:23.309
such as using a power tool,

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.018
working on uneven terrain

00:00:25.042 --> 00:00:26.292
and driving a car.

00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:29.333
That all sounds impressive, and it is,

00:00:30.458 --> 00:00:33.250
but look at the body
of the winning robot, HUBO.

00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:36.518
Here, HUBO is trying to get out of a car,

00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:38.268
and keep in mind,

00:00:38.292 --> 00:00:40.059
the video is sped up three times.

00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:43.708
(Laughter)

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.726
HUBO, from team KAIST out of Korea,
is a state-of-the-art robot

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.518
with impressive capabilities,

00:00:49.542 --> 00:00:51.684
but this body doesn't look
all that different

00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:53.661
from robots we've seen a few decades ago.

00:00:54.625 --> 00:00:57.042
If you look at the other robots
in the competition,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.101
their movements also still look,
well, very robotic.

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:03.351
Their bodies are complex
mechanical structures

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:04.976
using rigid materials

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.601
such as metal and traditional
rigid electric motors.

00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:10.226
They certainly weren't designed

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.309
to be low-cost, safe near people

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:16.184
and adaptable to unpredictable challenges.

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:18.976
We've made good progress
with the brains of robots,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.792
but their bodies are still primitive.

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:24.643
This is my daughter Nadia.

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:26.393
She's only five years old

00:01:26.417 --> 00:01:28.893
and she can get out of the car
way faster than HUBO.

00:01:28.917 --> 00:01:30.684
(Laughter)

00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:33.101
She can also swing around
on monkey bars with ease,

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:36.268
much better than any current
human-like robot could do.

00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:37.643
In contrast to HUBO,

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:41.393
the human body makes extensive use
of soft and deformable materials

00:01:41.417 --> 00:01:43.351
such as muscle and skin.

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:45.726
We need a new generation of robot bodies

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.851
that is inspired by the elegance,
efficiency and by the soft materials

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:51.417
of the designs found in nature.

00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:56.518
And indeed, this has become
the key idea of a new field of research

00:01:56.542 --> 00:01:58.476
called soft robotics.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.393
My research group
and collaborators around the world

00:02:01.417 --> 00:02:05.059
are using soft components
inspired by muscle and skin

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:07.893
to build robots with agility and dexterity

00:02:07.917 --> 00:02:09.559
that comes closer and closer

00:02:09.583 --> 00:02:12.875
to the astonishing capabilities
of the organisms found in nature.

00:02:14.458 --> 00:02:18.143
I've always been particularly inspired
by biological muscle.

00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:20.309
Now, that's not surprising.

00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:23.934
I'm also Austrian, and I know that I sound
a bit like Arnie, the Terminator.

00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.976
(Laughter)

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.976
Biological muscle
is a true masterpiece of evolution.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.559
It can heal after damage

00:02:31.583 --> 00:02:34.018
and it's tightly integrated
with sensory neurons

00:02:34.042 --> 00:02:36.167
for feedback on motion
and the environment.

00:02:37.083 --> 00:02:39.976
It can contract fast enough
to power the high-speed wings

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.268
of a hummingbird;

00:02:41.292 --> 00:02:43.976
it can grow strong enough
to move an elephant;

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.559
and it's adaptable enough
to be used in the extremely versatile arms

00:02:47.583 --> 00:02:48.893
of an octopus,

00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:52.250
an animal that can squeeze
its entire body through tiny holes.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.143
Actuators are for robots
what muscles are for animals:

00:02:57.167 --> 00:02:59.018
key components of the body

00:02:59.042 --> 00:03:01.583
that enable movement
and interaction with the world.

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:05.143
So if we could build soft actuators,

00:03:05.167 --> 00:03:06.601
or artificial muscles,

00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:08.226
that are as versatile, adaptable

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.809
and could have the same performance
as the real thing,

00:03:10.833 --> 00:03:12.768
we could build almost any type of robot

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:14.167
for almost any type of use.

00:03:15.167 --> 00:03:18.351
Not surprisingly,
people have tried for many decades

00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:21.268
to replicate the astonishing
capabilities of muscle,

00:03:21.292 --> 00:03:22.625
but it's been really hard.

00:03:24.583 --> 00:03:26.059
About 10 years ago,

00:03:26.083 --> 00:03:28.809
when I did my PhD back in Austria,

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:30.934
my colleagues and I rediscovered

00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:35.101
what is likely one of the very first
publications on artificial muscle,

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:36.976
published in 1880.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.143
"On the shape and volume changes
of dielectric bodies

00:03:40.167 --> 00:03:41.684
caused by electricity,"

00:03:41.708 --> 00:03:44.809
published by German physicist
Wilhelm RÃ¶ntgen.

00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:47.875
Most of you know him
as the discoverer of the X-ray.

00:03:49.292 --> 00:03:51.851
Following his instructions,
we used a pair of needles.

00:03:51.875 --> 00:03:53.829
We connected it to a high-voltage source,

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:56.309
and we placed it near
a transparent piece of rubber

00:03:56.313 --> 00:03:58.397
that was prestretched
onto a plastic frame.

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:01.018
When we switched on the voltage,

00:04:01.042 --> 00:04:02.351
the rubber deformed,

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:05.559
and just like our biceps flexes our arm,

00:04:05.583 --> 00:04:08.226
the rubber flexed the plastic frame.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.559
It looks like magic.

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.934
The needles don't even touch the rubber.

00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.476
Now, having two such needles
is not a practical way

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.643
of operating artificial muscles,

00:04:16.667 --> 00:04:19.809
but this amazing experiment
got me hooked on the topic.

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:22.851
I wanted to create new ways
to build artificial muscles

00:04:22.875 --> 00:04:25.684
that would work well
for real-world applications.

00:04:25.708 --> 00:04:29.434
For the next years, I worked
on a number of different technologies

00:04:29.458 --> 00:04:30.767
that all showed promise,

00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:33.833
but they all had remaining challenges
that are hard to overcome.

00:04:34.833 --> 00:04:36.434
In 2015,

00:04:36.458 --> 00:04:38.851
when I started my own lab at CU Boulder,

00:04:38.875 --> 00:04:41.101
I wanted to try an entirely new idea.

00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:44.018
I wanted to combine
the high speed and efficiency

00:04:44.042 --> 00:04:46.018
of electrically driven actuators

00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:48.792
with the versatility
of soft, fluidic actuators.

00:04:49.458 --> 00:04:50.768
Therefore, I thought,

00:04:50.792 --> 00:04:54.143
maybe I can try using
really old science in a new way.

00:04:54.167 --> 00:04:55.934
The diagram you see here

00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.518
shows an effect called Maxwell stress.

00:04:58.542 --> 00:05:00.018
When you take two metal plates

00:05:00.042 --> 00:05:02.226
and place them in a container
filled with oil,

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.893
and then switch on a voltage,

00:05:03.917 --> 00:05:07.851
the Maxwell stress forces the oil
up in between the two plates,

00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:09.351
and that's what you see here.

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:10.726
So the key idea was,

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.684
can we use this effect to push around oil

00:05:13.708 --> 00:05:16.518
contained in soft stretchy structures?

00:05:16.542 --> 00:05:18.893
And indeed, this worked surprisingly well,

00:05:18.917 --> 00:05:21.601
quite honestly,
much better than I expected.

00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:23.809
Together with my
outstanding team of students,

00:05:23.833 --> 00:05:25.726
we used this idea as a starting point

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.893
to develop a new technology
called HASEL artificial muscles.

00:05:29.917 --> 00:05:33.018
HASELs are gentle enough
to pick up a raspberry

00:05:33.042 --> 00:05:34.333
without damaging it.

00:05:36.542 --> 00:05:39.750
They can expand and contract
like real muscle.

00:05:41.625 --> 00:05:44.083
And they can be operated
faster than the real thing.

00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.601
They can also be scaled up
to deliver large forces.

00:05:47.625 --> 00:05:50.976
Here you see them lifting
a gallon filled with water.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.934
They can be used to drive a robotic arm,

00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:55.042
and they can even
self-sense their position.

00:05:57.292 --> 00:06:00.000
HASELs can be used
for very precise movement,

00:06:01.292 --> 00:06:04.143
but they can also deliver
very fluidic, muscle-like movement

00:06:04.167 --> 00:06:07.042
and bursts of power
to shoot up a ball into the air.

00:06:09.375 --> 00:06:10.958
When submerged in oil,

00:06:12.667 --> 00:06:16.208
HASEL artificial muscles
can be made invisible.

00:06:19.875 --> 00:06:21.792
So how do HASEL artificial muscles work?

00:06:22.542 --> 00:06:24.226
You might be surprised.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.434
They're based on very inexpensive,
easily available materials.

00:06:27.458 --> 00:06:29.726
You can even try, and I recommend it,

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.083
the main principle at home.

00:06:31.875 --> 00:06:34.643
Take a few Ziploc bags
and fill them with olive oil.

00:06:34.667 --> 00:06:36.875
Try to push out air bubbles
as much as you can.

00:06:37.583 --> 00:06:40.684
Now take a glass plate
and place it on one side of the bag.

00:06:40.708 --> 00:06:42.917
When you press down,
you see the bag contract.

00:06:43.792 --> 00:06:46.458
Now the amount of contraction
is easy to control.

00:06:47.167 --> 00:06:49.976
When you take a small weight,
you get a small contraction.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.125
With a medium weight,
we get a medium contraction.

00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:57.018
And with a large weight,
you get a large contraction.

00:06:57.042 --> 00:07:00.476
Now for HASELs, the only change
is to replace the force of your hand

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.518
or the weight with an electrical force.

00:07:03.542 --> 00:07:08.893
HASEL stands for "hydraulically amplified
self-healing electrostatic actuators."

00:07:08.917 --> 00:07:12.101
Here you see a geometry
called Peano-HASEL actuators,

00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:14.417
one of many possible designs.

00:07:15.083 --> 00:07:18.684
Again, you take a flexible polymer
such as our Ziploc bag,

00:07:18.708 --> 00:07:21.643
you fill it with an insulating liquid,
such as olive oil,

00:07:21.667 --> 00:07:23.434
and now, instead of the glass plate,

00:07:23.458 --> 00:07:26.250
you place an electrical conductor
on one side of the pouch.

00:07:26.958 --> 00:07:29.601
To create something
that looks more like a muscle fiber,

00:07:29.625 --> 00:07:31.601
you can connect a few pouches together

00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:33.768
and attached a weight on one side.

00:07:33.792 --> 00:07:35.167
Next, we apply voltage.

00:07:36.083 --> 00:07:39.393
Now, the electric field
starts acting on the liquid.

00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:41.101
It displaces the liquid,

00:07:41.125 --> 00:07:43.125
and it forces the muscle to contract.

00:07:44.708 --> 00:07:47.184
Here you see a completed
Peano-HASEL actuator

00:07:47.208 --> 00:07:51.101
and how it expands and contracts
when voltage is applied.

00:07:51.125 --> 00:07:52.434
Viewed from the side,

00:07:52.458 --> 00:07:55.684
you can really see those pouches
take a more cylindrical shape,

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:57.500
such as we saw with the Ziploc bags.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.726
We can also place a few
such muscle fibers next to each other

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.309
to create something that looks
even more like a muscle

00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:06.768
that also contracts and expands
in cross section.

00:08:06.792 --> 00:08:10.143
These HASELs here are lifting a weight
that's about 200 times heavier

00:08:10.167 --> 00:08:11.458
than their own weight.

00:08:12.667 --> 00:08:16.143
Here you see one of our newest designs,
called quadrant donut HASELs

00:08:16.167 --> 00:08:17.768
and how they expand and contract.

00:08:17.792 --> 00:08:20.875
They can be operated incredibly fast,
reaching superhuman speeds.

00:08:23.333 --> 00:08:26.309
They are even powerful enough
to jump off the ground.

00:08:26.333 --> 00:08:27.667
(Laughter)

00:08:28.917 --> 00:08:32.434
Overall, HASELs show promise
to become the first technology

00:08:32.458 --> 00:08:35.976
that matches or exceeds the performance
of biological muscle

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.143
while being compatible
with large-scale manufacturing.

00:08:39.167 --> 00:08:42.309
This is also a very young technology.
We are just getting started.

00:08:42.333 --> 00:08:45.101
We have many ideas how to
drastically improve performance,

00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:48.976
using new materials and new designs
to reach a level of performance

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.332
beyond biological muscle and also beyond
traditional rigid electric motors.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.643
Moving towards more complex designs
of HASEL for bio-inspired robotics,

00:08:57.667 --> 00:08:59.434
here you see our artificial scorpion

00:08:59.458 --> 00:09:01.184
that can use its tail to hunt prey,

00:09:01.208 --> 00:09:02.726
in this case, a rubber balloon.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.393
(Laughter)

00:09:04.417 --> 00:09:06.518
Going back to our initial inspiration,

00:09:06.542 --> 00:09:09.351
the versatility of octopus arms
and elephant trunks,

00:09:09.375 --> 00:09:12.143
we are now able to build
soft continuum actuators

00:09:12.167 --> 00:09:15.292
that come closer and closer
to the capabilities of the real thing.

00:09:17.833 --> 00:09:20.726
I am most excited
about the practical applications

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.559
of HASEL artificial muscles.

00:09:22.583 --> 00:09:24.976
They'll enable soft robotic devices

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.351
that can improve the quality of life.

00:09:27.375 --> 00:09:31.184
Soft robotics will enable a new generation
of more lifelike prosthetics

00:09:31.208 --> 00:09:33.434
for people who have lost
parts of their bodies.

00:09:33.458 --> 00:09:35.268
Here you see some HASELs in my lab,

00:09:35.292 --> 00:09:37.875
early testing,
driving a prosthetic finger.

00:09:39.542 --> 00:09:43.417
One day, we may even merge
our bodies with robotic parts.

00:09:45.125 --> 00:09:47.250
I know that sounds very scary at first.

00:09:48.917 --> 00:09:50.768
But when I think about my grandparents

00:09:50.792 --> 00:09:53.726
and the way they become
more dependent on others

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.851
to perform simple everyday tasks
such as using the restroom alone,

00:09:57.875 --> 00:10:00.083
they often feel like
they're becoming a burden.

00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:04.226
With soft robotics, we will be able
to enhance and restore

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.851
agility and dexterity,

00:10:05.875 --> 00:10:08.768
and thereby help older people
maintain autonomy

00:10:08.792 --> 00:10:11.059
for longer parts of their lives.

00:10:11.083 --> 00:10:13.583
Maybe we can call that
"robotics for antiaging"

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.458
or even a next stage of human evolution.

00:10:19.083 --> 00:10:21.934
Unlike their traditional
rigid counterparts,

00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:26.833
soft life-like robots will safely operate
near people and help us at home.

00:10:27.667 --> 00:10:31.059
Soft robotics is a very young field.
We're just getting started.

00:10:31.083 --> 00:10:34.184
I hope that many young people
from many different backgrounds

00:10:34.208 --> 00:10:36.059
join us on this exciting journey

00:10:36.083 --> 00:10:38.226
and help shape the future of robotics

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.833
by introducing new concepts
inspired by nature.

00:10:42.708 --> 00:10:44.309
If we do this right,

00:10:44.333 --> 00:10:46.101
we can improve the quality of life

00:10:46.125 --> 00:10:47.434
for all of us.

00:10:47.458 --> 00:10:48.726
Thank you.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:52.917
(Applause)
