00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.160
When I tell people

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.936
that I'm trying to develop
a contraceptive pill for men,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.680
the response usually varies
along gender lines.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.976
Women say something like,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.296
"Fantastic. It's about time. When?"

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.616
(Laughter)

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.736
Men have one of two responses.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.976
They either love the idea,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.056
or they look at me a little warily

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.576
and wonder what exactly
I have in store for their testicles.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.336
(Laughter)

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.200
So why does the world need a male pill?

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.976
Well, what if I told you

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.416
that of the six million pregnancies
annually in the United States,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.336
three million of them are unintended?

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.936
That's half.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.136
That's a really surprising number.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.736
And those three million
unintended pregnancies

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.016
account for the vast majority
of the more than one million abortions

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.320
annually performed in the United States.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.856
Happily, the rate of unintended pregnancy
has fallen in the last few years

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.696
by about 10 percent.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.656
This is because more women
are using effective, long-acting,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.600
reversible forms of contraception.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.840
But we still have a long way to go.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.216
One approach that's finally
becoming a real possibility

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.360
is better contraceptive options for men.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.816
Think about it.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.496
We have over a dozen methods
of contraception for women:

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.360
pills, patches, IUDs,
shots, sponges, rings, etc.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.136
For men, we've had the same two options

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.616
for more than a hundred years:

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.240
condoms and vasectomy.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.656
Despite having only two options,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.456
both of which have significant drawbacks,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.056
men currently account
for 30 percent of all contraceptive use,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.736
with 10 percent of couples
relying on vasectomy

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.240
and 20 percent of couples using condoms.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.656
Why are 20 percent of couples
relying on condoms for contraception

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.080
when condoms have a one-year
failure rate of over 15 percent?

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.056
It's because many women
can't either safely take

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.816
currently available female contraceptives,
for reasons such as blood clots,

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.200
or they can't tolerate the side effects.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.136
So if we think a male contraceptive
would be useful, the next question is:

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.200
How do we go about developing one?

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.920
Well, there's two general approaches.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.616
The first approach is to try and interfere

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.120
with the way the sperm
swim towards or bind to the egg.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.056
This approach turns out
to be really difficult,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.176
because it's hard to get enough medication
in the small volume of the ejaculate

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.520
and have it still work inside
the female reproductive tract.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.376
This is why there's been a lot more work
done on the second approach,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.520
which is turning off
sperm production entirely.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.136
This is also challenging.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.256
Why? Turns out
that men make a lot of sperm.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.696
(Laughter)

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.320
Men make a thousand sperm every second

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.576
and to have an effective contraceptive,

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.776
you need to get that level
of sperm production

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.000
down to one percent of its normal value.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.336
The good news is, this is possible,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.776
almost.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.800
The most studied approach has been to use
hormones to suppress sperm production.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.136
Testosterone and progesterone,
when administered together,

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.336
will suppress the signals from the brain
to the testes to make sperm,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.496
and in about 90 percent of men,

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.880
sperm production after
three to four months will stop.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.376
Unfortunately, 10 percent of men
don't respond to these hormonal regimens

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.080
for reasons that aren't understood.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.016
For the last several years,
my colleagues and I

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.576
have been taking a different approach
to male contraceptive development,

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.320
one that doesn't involve
the administration of hormones.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.520
Specifically, we are looking to block
the function of vitamin A in the testes.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.896
Why? Well, for over 90 years
it's been known

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.280
that you need vitamin A to make sperm.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.976
Animals who are deprived
of vitamin A in their diet

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.896
stop making sperm

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.600
and restart making sperm again
when the vitamin A is reintroduced.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.255
The vitamin A that we ingest

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:32.360
is converted by a family of enzymes
to something called retinoic acid.

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:37.056
One of these enzymes
is found only in the testes.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.176
It's this enzyme
that we are attempting to block.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.616
The blockade of this enzyme
should deprive the testes of retinoic acid

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.576
and stop sperm production

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.800
without affecting vitamin A's functions
elsewhere in the body.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.616
We're testing this approach in animals

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.800
and hope to move to human testing soon.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.376
Obviously, the impact
of such a male contraceptive

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.800
would go well beyond reproductive biology.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.496
It's interesting to speculate
about the effect that it would have

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.400
on relationships between men and women.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.776
One intriguing possibility

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.040
is that a man could monitor
his contraceptive status over time.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.296
In the last several years,

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.576
two groups have introduced
home sperm-testing devices

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.096
that are iPhone-based

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.760
and that are easy to use.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.936
A man could test his sperm count
and share the result with his partner.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.776
If the man's sperm count were zero,

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.616
the man and his partner
would feel very comfortable

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.496
relying on his contraceptive.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.696
A tool like this,
coupled with a male contraceptive,

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.040
could greatly increase the role for men
in preventing unintended pregnancy.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.616
The researchers who are working
on male contraception

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.456
are trying to create
a better future for couples,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.016
a future where contraception is no longer
considered just "a woman's issue,"

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.960
rather an issue
for couples to decide together.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.760
So why does the world need a male pill?

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.256
Well, I believe that a male pill

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:12.096
will help reduce the stubbornly high
rates of unintended pregnancy and abortion

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.016
and allow men to equally participate

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.240
in contraception.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.256
Thank you.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.520
(Applause)
