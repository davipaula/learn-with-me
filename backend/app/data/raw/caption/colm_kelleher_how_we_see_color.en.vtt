00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.449
You might have heard that light is a kind of wave

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:18.947
and that the color of an object

00:00:18.947 --> 00:00:22.133
is related to the frequency of light waves it reflects.

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:24.216
High-frequency light waves look violet,

00:00:24.216 --> 00:00:26.019
low-frequency light waves look red,

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:27.931
and in-between frequencies look yellow,

00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:28.383
green,

00:00:28.383 --> 00:00:29.020
orange,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.662
and so on.

00:00:30.662 --> 00:00:32.988
You might call this idea physical color

00:00:32.988 --> 00:00:36.677
because it says that color is a physical property of light itself.

00:00:36.677 --> 00:00:39.085
It's not dependent on human perception.

00:00:39.085 --> 00:00:41.245
And, while this isn't wrong,

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:43.748
it isn't quite the whole story either.

00:00:43.748 --> 00:00:47.322
For instance, you might have seen this picture before.

00:00:47.322 --> 00:00:51.781
As you can see, the region where the red and green lights overlap is yellow.

00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:54.156
When you think about it, this is pretty weird.

00:00:54.156 --> 00:00:56.733
Because light is a wave, two different frequencies

00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.895
shouldn't interact with each other at all,

00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:00.212
they should just co-exist

00:01:00.212 --> 00:01:02.468
like singers singing in harmony.

00:01:02.468 --> 00:01:04.501
So, in this yellow looking region,

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:07.372
two different kinds of light waves are present:

00:01:07.372 --> 00:01:08.907
one with a red frequency,

00:01:08.907 --> 00:01:10.667
and one with a green frequency.

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:13.122
There is no yellow light present at all.

00:01:13.122 --> 00:01:14.473
So, how come this region,

00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:16.620
where the red and green lights mix,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.542
looks yellow to us?

00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:22.054
To understand this, you have to understand a little bit about biology,

00:01:22.054 --> 00:01:25.131
in particular, about how humans see color.

00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:28.463
Light perception happens in a paper-thin layer of cells,

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:29.422
called the retina,

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:31.672
that covers the back of your eyeball.

00:01:31.672 --> 00:01:35.532
In the retina, there are two different types of light-detecting cells:

00:01:35.532 --> 00:01:37.855
rods and cones.

00:01:37.855 --> 00:01:40.437
The rods are used for seeing in low-light conditions,

00:01:40.437 --> 00:01:42.680
and there is only one kind of those.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.672
The cones, however, are a different story.

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:47.984
There three kinds of cone cells that roughly correspond

00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:49.338
to the colors red,

00:01:49.338 --> 00:01:49.824
green,

00:01:49.824 --> 00:01:51.318
and blue.

00:01:51.318 --> 00:01:52.934
When you see a color,

00:01:52.934 --> 00:01:56.758
each cone sends its own distinct signal to your brain.

00:01:56.758 --> 00:01:58.985
For example, suppose that yellow light,

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:01.548
that is real yellow light, with a yellow frequency,

00:02:01.548 --> 00:02:03.155
is shining on your eye.

00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:06.052
You don't have a cone specifically for detecting yellow,

00:02:06.052 --> 00:02:08.088
but yellow is kind of close to green

00:02:08.088 --> 00:02:09.553
and also kind of close to red,

00:02:09.553 --> 00:02:12.152
so both the red and green cones get activated,

00:02:12.152 --> 00:02:16.179
and each sends a signal to your brain saying so.

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:18.145
Of course, there is another way to activate

00:02:18.145 --> 00:02:21.142
the red cones and the green cones simultaneously:

00:02:21.142 --> 00:02:24.742
if both red light and green light are present at the same time.

00:02:24.742 --> 00:02:28.120
The point is, your brain receives the same signal,

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.642
regardless of whether you see light that has the yellow frequency

00:02:31.642 --> 00:02:35.189
or light that is a mixture of the green and red frequencies.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.328
That's why, for light, red plus green equals yellow.

00:02:39.328 --> 00:02:42.781
And, how come you can't detect colors when it's dark?

00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:45.360
Well, the rod cells in your retina take over

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.987
in low-light conditions.

00:02:46.987 --> 00:02:48.989
You only have one kind of rod cell,

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.976
and so there is one type of signal

00:02:50.976 --> 00:02:52.598
that can get sent to your brain:

00:02:52.598 --> 00:02:54.591
light or no light.

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:57.059
Having only one kind of light detector

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:59.713
doesn't leave any room for seeing color.

00:02:59.713 --> 00:03:02.122
There are infinitely many different physical colors,

00:03:02.122 --> 00:03:04.830
but, because we only have three kinds of cones,

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.744
the brain can be tricked into thinking it's seeing any color

00:03:07.744 --> 00:03:10.813
by carefully adding together the right combination

00:03:10.813 --> 00:03:12.419
of just three colors:

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.065
red, green, and blue.

00:03:14.065 --> 00:03:17.789
This property of human vision is really useful in the real world.

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:20.079
For example, TV manufacturing.

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.156
Instead of having to put infinitely many colors in your TV set

00:03:23.156 --> 00:03:24.600
to simulate the real world,

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.154
TV manufacturers only have to put three:

00:03:27.154 --> 00:03:29.291
red, green, and blue,

00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:31.614
which is lucky for them, really.
