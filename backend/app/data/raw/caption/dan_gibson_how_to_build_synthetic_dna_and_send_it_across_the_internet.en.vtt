00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:16.563
Alright, let me tell you
about building synthetic cells

00:00:16.587 --> 00:00:18.532
and printing life.

00:00:18.556 --> 00:00:21.039
But first, let me tell you a quick story.

00:00:21.063 --> 00:00:23.569
On March 31, 2013,

00:00:23.593 --> 00:00:27.776
my team and I received an email
from an international health organization,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.633
alerting us that two men died in China

00:00:30.657 --> 00:00:33.712
shortly after contracting
the H7N9 bird flu.

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.006
There were fears of a global pandemic

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.363
as the virus started rapidly
moving across China.

00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:42.786
Although methods existed
to produce a flu vaccine

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.782
and stop the disease from spreading,

00:00:44.806 --> 00:00:48.650
at best, it would not be available
for at least six months.

00:00:49.474 --> 00:00:54.204
This is because a slow, antiquated
flu vaccine manufacturing process

00:00:54.228 --> 00:00:58.186
developed over 70 years ago
was the only option.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.592
The virus would need to be isolated
from infected patients,

00:01:02.616 --> 00:01:04.910
packaged up and then sent to a facility

00:01:04.934 --> 00:01:08.950
where scientists would inject
the virus into chicken eggs,

00:01:08.974 --> 00:01:11.545
and incubate those chicken eggs
for several weeks

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:15.291
in order to prepare the virus
for the start of a multistep,

00:01:15.315 --> 00:01:18.597
multimonth flu vaccine
manufacturing process.

00:01:19.363 --> 00:01:21.357
My team and I received this email

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:25.267
because we had just invented
a biological printer,

00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:27.712
which would allow
for the flu vaccine instructions

00:01:27.736 --> 00:01:31.057
to be instantly downloaded
from the internet and printed.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:34.919
Drastically speeding up the way
in which flu vaccines are made,

00:01:34.943 --> 00:01:37.743
and potentially saving thousands of lives.

00:01:38.776 --> 00:01:43.750
The biological printer leverages
our ability to read and write DNA

00:01:43.774 --> 00:01:45.744
and starts to bring into focus

00:01:45.768 --> 00:01:48.901
what we like to call
biological teleportation.

00:01:49.704 --> 00:01:53.904
I am a biologist and an engineer
who builds stuff out of DNA.

00:01:54.577 --> 00:01:56.926
Believe it or not,
one of my favorite things to do

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.327
is to take DNA apart
and put it back together

00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:02.109
so that I can understand
better how it works.

00:02:02.442 --> 00:02:07.101
I can edit and program DNA to do things,
just like coders programing a computer.

00:02:07.797 --> 00:02:09.598
But my apps are different.

00:02:09.622 --> 00:02:10.868
They create life.

00:02:10.892 --> 00:02:15.164
Self-replicating living cells
and things like vaccines and therapeutics

00:02:15.188 --> 00:02:18.295
that work in ways
that were previously impossible.

00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:22.442
Here's National Medal of Science
recipient Craig Venter

00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:24.601
and Nobel laureate Ham Smith.

00:02:25.038 --> 00:02:27.347
These two guys shared a similar vision.

00:02:27.371 --> 00:02:31.768
That vision was, because all
of the functions and characteristics

00:02:31.792 --> 00:02:35.949
of all biological entities,
including viruses and living cells,

00:02:35.973 --> 00:02:38.403
are written into the code of DNA,

00:02:38.427 --> 00:02:41.823
if one can read and write
that code of DNA,

00:02:41.847 --> 00:02:45.110
then they can be reconstructed
in a distant location.

00:02:46.043 --> 00:02:49.377
This is what we mean
by biological teleportation.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.552
To prove out this vision,

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:54.569
Craig and Ham set a goal
of creating, for the first time,

00:02:54.593 --> 00:02:57.746
a synthetic cell, starting
from DNA code in the computer.

00:02:58.284 --> 00:03:03.141
I mean, come on,
as a scientist looking for a job,

00:03:03.165 --> 00:03:06.228
doing cutting-edge research,
it doesn't get any better than this.

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:08.011
(Laughter)

00:03:08.035 --> 00:03:12.562
OK, a genome is a complete set
of DNA within an organism.

00:03:13.138 --> 00:03:15.847
Following the Human
Genome Project in 2003,

00:03:15.871 --> 00:03:18.070
which was an international
effort to identify

00:03:18.094 --> 00:03:21.252
the complete genetic blueprint
of a human being,

00:03:21.276 --> 00:03:23.529
a genomics revolution happened.

00:03:23.553 --> 00:03:27.245
Scientists started mastering
the techniques for reading DNA.

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.563
In order to determine the order
of the As, Cs, Ts and Gs

00:03:30.587 --> 00:03:31.853
within an organism.

00:03:32.475 --> 00:03:34.031
But my job was far different.

00:03:34.412 --> 00:03:37.418
I needed to master
the techniques for writing DNA.

00:03:37.442 --> 00:03:38.712
Like an author of a book,

00:03:38.736 --> 00:03:40.918
this started out
as writing short sentences,

00:03:40.942 --> 00:03:43.045
or sequences of DNA code,

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.347
but this soon turned into
writing paragraphs

00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:47.736
and then full-on novels of DNA code,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.989
to make important biological instructions
for proteins and living cells.

00:03:52.466 --> 00:03:55.966
Living cells are nature's most efficient
machines at making new products,

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.649
accounting for the production

00:03:57.673 --> 00:04:01.244
of 25 percent of the total
pharmaceutical market,

00:04:01.268 --> 00:04:03.201
which is billions of dollars.

00:04:03.823 --> 00:04:07.704
We knew that writing DNA
would drive this bioeconomy even more,

00:04:07.728 --> 00:04:10.894
once cells could be programmed
just like computers.

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:15.990
We also knew that writing DNA
would enable biological teleportation ...

00:04:17.186 --> 00:04:20.094
the printing of defined,
biological material,

00:04:20.118 --> 00:04:21.813
starting from DNA code.

00:04:22.575 --> 00:04:25.537
As a step toward bringing
these promises to fruition,

00:04:25.561 --> 00:04:28.283
our team set out to create,
for the first time,

00:04:28.307 --> 00:04:30.545
a synthetic bacterial cell,

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.168
starting from DNA code in the computer.

00:04:33.918 --> 00:04:36.045
Synthetic DNA is a commodity.

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:39.680
You can order very short pieces of DNA
from a number of companies,

00:04:39.704 --> 00:04:43.371
and they will start from these four
bottles of chemicals that make up DNA,

00:04:43.395 --> 00:04:44.840
G, A, T and C,

00:04:44.864 --> 00:04:48.120
and they will build
those very short pieces of DNA for you.

00:04:48.986 --> 00:04:50.819
Over the past 15 years or so,

00:04:50.843 --> 00:04:53.166
my teams have been
developing the technology

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.946
for stitching together
those short pieces of DNA

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.160
into complete bacterial genomes.

00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:03.204
The largest genome that we constructed
contained over one million letters.

00:05:03.942 --> 00:05:06.602
Which is more than twice the size
of your average novel,

00:05:06.626 --> 00:05:10.069
and we had to put every single one
of those letters in the correct order,

00:05:10.093 --> 00:05:11.362
without a single typo.

00:05:11.386 --> 00:05:15.679
We were able to accomplish this
by developing a procedure

00:05:15.703 --> 00:05:20.750
that I tried to call the "one-step
isothermal in vitro recombination method."

00:05:20.774 --> 00:05:22.863
(Laughter)

00:05:22.887 --> 00:05:27.879
But, surprisingly, the science community
didn't like this technically accurate name

00:05:27.903 --> 00:05:30.503
and decided to call it Gibson Assembly.

00:05:31.625 --> 00:05:34.482
Gibson Assembly
is now the gold standard tool,

00:05:34.506 --> 00:05:36.974
used in laboratories around the world

00:05:36.998 --> 00:05:39.798
for building short and long pieces of DNA.

00:05:40.236 --> 00:05:45.569
(Applause)

00:05:45.593 --> 00:05:48.918
Once we chemically synthesized
the complete bacterial genome,

00:05:48.942 --> 00:05:51.252
our next challenge was to find a way

00:05:51.276 --> 00:05:54.744
to convert it into a free-living,
self-replicating cell.

00:05:55.427 --> 00:05:59.252
Our approach was to think of the genome
as the operating system of the cell,

00:05:59.276 --> 00:06:03.771
with the cell containing the hardware
necessary to boot up the genome.

00:06:04.553 --> 00:06:06.172
Through a lot of trial and error,

00:06:06.196 --> 00:06:09.331
we developed a procedure
where we could reprogram cells

00:06:09.355 --> 00:06:12.704
and even convert one
bacterial species into another,

00:06:12.728 --> 00:06:16.252
by replacing the genome of one cell
with that of another.

00:06:17.363 --> 00:06:21.427
This genome transplantation
technology then paved the way

00:06:21.451 --> 00:06:24.680
for the booting-up of genomes
written by scientists

00:06:24.704 --> 00:06:26.371
and not by Mother Nature.

00:06:26.768 --> 00:06:29.387
In 2010, all of the technologies

00:06:29.411 --> 00:06:32.196
that we had been developing
for reading and writing DNA

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.141
all came together
when we announced the creation

00:06:35.165 --> 00:06:37.379
of the first synthetic cell,

00:06:37.403 --> 00:06:39.561
which of course, we called Synthia.

00:06:39.585 --> 00:06:41.586
(Laughter)

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.190
Ever since the first bacterial genome
was sequenced, back in 1995,

00:06:46.214 --> 00:06:49.673
thousands more whole bacterial genomes
have been sequenced and stored

00:06:49.697 --> 00:06:51.103
in computer databases.

00:06:51.601 --> 00:06:53.988
Our synthetic cell work
was the proof of concept

00:06:54.012 --> 00:06:56.022
that we could reverse this process:

00:06:56.046 --> 00:06:59.641
pull a complete bacterial genome
sequence out of the computer

00:06:59.665 --> 00:07:04.426
and convert that information
into a free-living, self-replicating cell,

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.788
with all of the expected characteristics
of the species that we constructed.

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:12.958
Now I can understand
why there may be concerns

00:07:12.982 --> 00:07:16.176
about the safety of this level
of genetic manipulation.

00:07:16.918 --> 00:07:21.069
While the technology has the potential
for great societal benefit,

00:07:21.093 --> 00:07:23.533
it also has the potential for doing harm.

00:07:24.355 --> 00:07:28.418
With this in mind, even before
carrying out the very first experiment,

00:07:28.442 --> 00:07:31.307
our team started to work
with the public and the government

00:07:31.331 --> 00:07:33.934
to find solutions together

00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.758
to responsibly develop
and regulate this new technology.

00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:42.133
One of the outcomes from those discussions
was to screen every customer

00:07:42.157 --> 00:07:44.752
and every customer's DNA synthesis orders,

00:07:44.776 --> 00:07:49.672
to make sure that pathogens or toxins
are not being made by bad guys,

00:07:49.696 --> 00:07:51.630
or accidentally by scientists.

00:07:52.974 --> 00:07:56.362
All suspicious orders
are reported to the FBI

00:07:56.386 --> 00:07:59.156
and other relevant
law-enforcement agencies.

00:08:00.641 --> 00:08:04.911
Synthetic cell technologies
will power the next industrial revolution

00:08:04.935 --> 00:08:07.799
and transform industries and economies

00:08:07.823 --> 00:08:11.490
in ways that address
global sustainability challenges.

00:08:12.006 --> 00:08:14.212
The possibilities are endless.

00:08:14.236 --> 00:08:15.824
I mean, you can think of clothes

00:08:15.848 --> 00:08:19.545
constructed form renewable
biobased sources,

00:08:19.569 --> 00:08:23.220
cars running on biofuel
from engineered microbes,

00:08:23.244 --> 00:08:26.823
plastics made from biodegradable polymers

00:08:26.847 --> 00:08:30.566
and customized therapies,
printed at a patient's bedside.

00:08:31.196 --> 00:08:33.783
The massive efforts
to create synthetic cells

00:08:33.807 --> 00:08:36.607
have made us world leaders at writing DNA.

00:08:37.149 --> 00:08:40.871
Throughout the process,
we found ways to write DNA faster,

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:43.095
more accurately and more reliably.

00:08:43.688 --> 00:08:45.982
Because of the robustness
of these technologies,

00:08:46.006 --> 00:08:49.006
we found that we could
readily automate the processes

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:52.696
and move the laboratory workflows
out of the scientist's hands

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.986
and onto a machine.

00:08:55.004 --> 00:08:58.004
In 2013, we built the first DNA printer.

00:08:58.631 --> 00:09:00.940
We call it the BioXp.

00:09:00.964 --> 00:09:04.160
And it has been absolutely
essential in writing DNA

00:09:04.184 --> 00:09:05.799
across a number of applications

00:09:05.823 --> 00:09:09.623
my team and researchers
around the world are working on.

00:09:10.077 --> 00:09:12.094
It was shortly after we built the BioXp

00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:17.004
that we received that email
about the H7N9 bird flu scare in China.

00:09:17.498 --> 00:09:20.919
A team of Chinese scientists
had already isolated the virus,

00:09:20.943 --> 00:09:24.459
sequenced its DNA and uploaded
the DNA sequence to the internet.

00:09:25.616 --> 00:09:29.131
At the request of the US government,
we downloaded the DNA sequence

00:09:29.155 --> 00:09:32.720
and in less than 12 hours,
we printed it on the BioXp.

00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:35.107
Our collaborators at Novartis

00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:39.146
then quickly started turning
that synthetic DNA into a flu vaccine.

00:09:39.497 --> 00:09:44.027
Meanwhile, the CDC, using technology
dating back to the 1940s,

00:09:44.051 --> 00:09:46.981
was still waiting for the virus
to arrive from China

00:09:47.005 --> 00:09:49.745
so that they could begin
their egg-based approach.

00:09:50.234 --> 00:09:53.783
For the first time, we had a flu vaccine
developed ahead of time

00:09:53.807 --> 00:09:56.276
for a new and potentially
dangerous strain,

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.941
and the US government ordered a stockpile.

00:09:58.965 --> 00:10:04.593
(Applause)

00:10:04.617 --> 00:10:07.085
This was when I began
to appreciate, more than ever,

00:10:07.109 --> 00:10:09.863
the power of biological teleportation.

00:10:09.887 --> 00:10:11.037
(Laughter)

00:10:11.061 --> 00:10:13.149
Naturally, with this in mind,

00:10:13.173 --> 00:10:15.379
we started to build
a biological teleporter.

00:10:16.402 --> 00:10:18.591
We call it the DBC.

00:10:18.615 --> 00:10:21.747
That's short for
digital-to-biological converter.

00:10:22.267 --> 00:10:23.601
Unlike the BioXp,

00:10:23.625 --> 00:10:26.704
which starts from pre-manufactured
short pieces of DNA,

00:10:26.728 --> 00:10:29.831
the DBC starts from digitized DNA code

00:10:29.855 --> 00:10:32.910
and converts that DNA code
into biological entities,

00:10:32.934 --> 00:10:36.467
such as DNA, RNA,
proteins or even viruses.

00:10:37.188 --> 00:10:40.061
You can think of the BioXp
as a DVD player,

00:10:40.085 --> 00:10:43.133
requiring a physical DVD to be inserted,

00:10:43.157 --> 00:10:45.490
whereas the DBC is Netflix.

00:10:47.974 --> 00:10:49.206
To build the DBC,

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:54.079
my team of scientists worked with
software and instrumentation engineers

00:10:54.103 --> 00:10:56.871
to collapse multiple laboratory workflows,

00:10:56.895 --> 00:10:58.363
all in a single box.

00:10:58.696 --> 00:11:02.577
This included software algorithms
to predict what DNA to build,

00:11:02.601 --> 00:11:07.053
chemistry to link the G, A, T and C
building blocks of DNA into short pieces,

00:11:07.077 --> 00:11:11.355
Gibson Assembly to stitch together
those short pieces into much longer ones,

00:11:11.379 --> 00:11:14.938
and biology to convert the DNA
into other biological entities,

00:11:14.962 --> 00:11:16.144
such as proteins.

00:11:17.089 --> 00:11:18.716
This is the prototype.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.930
Although it wasn't pretty,
it was effective.

00:11:20.954 --> 00:11:23.247
It made therapeutic drugs and vaccines.

00:11:23.271 --> 00:11:27.045
And laboratory workflows
that once took weeks or months

00:11:27.069 --> 00:11:30.617
could now be carried out
in just one to two days.

00:11:30.641 --> 00:11:33.228
And that's all without
any human intervention

00:11:33.252 --> 00:11:35.843
and simply activated
by the receipt of an email

00:11:35.867 --> 00:11:38.410
which could be sent
from anywhere in the world.

00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:42.188
We like to compare
the DBC to fax machines.

00:11:43.016 --> 00:11:46.381
But whereas fax machines
received images and documents,

00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:49.143
the DBC receives biological materials.

00:11:50.024 --> 00:11:52.706
Now, consider how
fax machines have evolved.

00:11:53.553 --> 00:11:56.736
The prototype of the 1840s
is unrecognizable,

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.278
compared with the fax machines of today.

00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:03.768
In the 1980s, most people
still didn't know what a fax machine was,

00:12:03.792 --> 00:12:05.188
and if they did,

00:12:05.212 --> 00:12:07.571
it was difficult for them
to grasp the concept

00:12:07.595 --> 00:12:11.216
of instantly reproducing an image
on the other side of the world.

00:12:11.672 --> 00:12:13.966
But nowadays, everything
that a fax machine does

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.665
is integrated on our smart phones,

00:12:15.689 --> 00:12:20.107
and of course, we take this rapid exchange
of digital information for granted.

00:12:20.831 --> 00:12:23.283
Here's what our DBC looks like today.

00:12:23.307 --> 00:12:27.694
We imagine the DBC evolving
in similar ways as fax machines have.

00:12:28.212 --> 00:12:30.839
We're working to reduce
the size of the instrument,

00:12:30.863 --> 00:12:33.482
and we're working to make
the underlying technology

00:12:33.506 --> 00:12:37.260
more reliable, cheaper,
faster and more accurate.

00:12:38.061 --> 00:12:41.823
Accuracy is extremely important
when synthesizing DNA,

00:12:41.847 --> 00:12:43.863
because a single change to a DNA letter

00:12:43.887 --> 00:12:46.911
could mean the difference
between a medicine working or not

00:12:46.935 --> 00:12:49.468
or synthetic cell being alive or dead.

00:12:50.292 --> 00:12:53.752
The DBC will be useful
for the distributed manufacturing

00:12:53.776 --> 00:12:55.776
of medicine starting from DNA.

00:12:56.649 --> 00:12:59.412
Every hospital in the world
could use a DBC

00:12:59.436 --> 00:13:03.167
for printing personalized medicines
for a patient at their bedside.

00:13:03.846 --> 00:13:08.856
I can even imagine a day
when it's routine for people to have a DBC

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.149
to connect to their
home computer or smart phone

00:13:11.173 --> 00:13:13.188
as a means to download
their prescriptions,

00:13:13.212 --> 00:13:15.331
such as insulin or antibody therapies.

00:13:15.355 --> 00:13:19.808
The DBC will also be valuable when placed
in strategic areas around the world,

00:13:19.832 --> 00:13:22.499
for rapid response to disease outbreaks.

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:25.982
For example, the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia

00:13:26.006 --> 00:13:30.799
could send flu vaccine instructions
to a DBC on the other side of the world,

00:13:30.823 --> 00:13:34.767
where the flu vaccine is manufactured
right on the front lines.

00:13:35.085 --> 00:13:40.315
That flu vaccine could even be
specifically tailored to the flu strain

00:13:40.339 --> 00:13:43.561
that's circulating in that local area.

00:13:43.585 --> 00:13:46.077
Sending vaccines around in a digital file,

00:13:46.101 --> 00:13:49.918
rather than stockpiling those same
vaccines and shipping them out,

00:13:49.942 --> 00:13:52.573
promises to save thousands of lives.

00:13:53.212 --> 00:13:57.412
Of course, the applications
go as far as the imagination goes.

00:13:58.164 --> 00:14:02.159
It's not hard to imagine
placing a DBC on another planet.

00:14:03.315 --> 00:14:08.419
Scientists on Earth could then send
the digital instructions to that DBC

00:14:08.443 --> 00:14:12.450
to make new medicines
or to make synthetic organisms

00:14:12.474 --> 00:14:16.141
that produce oxygen, food,
fuel or building materials,

00:14:16.165 --> 00:14:19.339
as a means for making the planet
more habitable for humans.

00:14:20.002 --> 00:14:24.442
(Applause)

00:14:24.466 --> 00:14:27.807
With digital information
traveling at the speed of light,

00:14:27.831 --> 00:14:30.728
it would only take minutes
to send those digital instructions

00:14:30.752 --> 00:14:31.942
from Earth to Mars,

00:14:31.966 --> 00:14:35.815
but it would take months
to physically deliver those same samples

00:14:35.839 --> 00:14:36.989
on a spacecraft.

00:14:37.821 --> 00:14:42.424
But for now, I would be satisfied
beaming new medicines across the globe,

00:14:42.448 --> 00:14:44.638
fully automated and on demand,

00:14:44.662 --> 00:14:48.260
saving lives from emerging
infectious diseases

00:14:48.284 --> 00:14:53.036
and printing personalized cancer medicines
for those who don't have time to wait.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.235
Thank you.

00:14:54.259 --> 00:15:01.259
(Applause)
