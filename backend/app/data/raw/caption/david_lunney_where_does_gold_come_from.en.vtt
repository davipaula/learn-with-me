00:00:07.772 --> 00:00:09.216
In medieval times,

00:00:09.216 --> 00:00:12.978
alchemists tried to achieve 
the seemingly impossible.

00:00:12.978 --> 00:00:17.411
They wanted to transform lowly lead
into gleaming gold.

00:00:17.411 --> 00:00:20.811
History portrays these people
as aged eccentrics,

00:00:20.811 --> 00:00:25.024
but if only they'd known that their
dreams were actually achievable.

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:28.723
Indeed, today we can 
manufacture gold on Earth

00:00:28.723 --> 00:00:30.365
thanks to modern inventions

00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:35.452
that those medieval alchemists
missed by a few centuries.

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:37.431
But to understand how this precious metal

00:00:37.431 --> 00:00:40.226
became embedded 
in our planet to start with,

00:00:40.226 --> 00:00:43.797
we have to gaze upwards at the stars.

00:00:43.797 --> 00:00:45.462
Gold is extraterrestrial.

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:48.231
Instead of arising 
from the planet's rocky crust,

00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:51.013
it was actually cooked up in space

00:00:51.013 --> 00:00:55.551
and is present on Earth 
because of cataclysmic stellar explosions

00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:57.993
called supernovae.

00:00:57.993 --> 00:01:02.202
Stars are mostly made up of hydrogen,
the simplest and lightest element.

00:01:02.202 --> 00:01:05.350
The enormous gravitational pressure
of so much material

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.144
compresses and triggers nuclear fusion
in the star's core.

00:01:10.144 --> 00:01:12.744
This process releases energy
from the hydrogen,

00:01:12.744 --> 00:01:14.870
making the star shine.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.347
Over many millions of years,

00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:20.494
fusion transforms hydrogen 
into heavier elements:

00:01:20.494 --> 00:01:23.476
helium, carbon, and oxygen,

00:01:23.476 --> 00:01:28.551
burning subsequent elements faster
and faster to reach iron and nickel.

00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:32.822
However, at that point nuclear fusion
no longer releases enough energy,

00:01:32.822 --> 00:01:36.357
and the pressure from the core peters out.

00:01:36.357 --> 00:01:38.676
The outer layers collapse into the center,

00:01:38.676 --> 00:01:41.782
and bouncing back from this sudden
injection of energy,

00:01:41.782 --> 00:01:46.411
the star explodes forming a supernova.

00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:49.879
The extreme pressure
of a collapsing star is so high,

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:55.116
that subatomic protons and electrons
are forced together in the core,

00:01:55.116 --> 00:01:57.074
forming neutrons.

00:01:57.074 --> 00:01:59.645
Neutrons have no repelling electric charge

00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:04.107
so they're easily captured 
by the iron group elements.

00:02:04.107 --> 00:02:08.225
Multiple neutron captures enable
the formation of heavier elements

00:02:08.225 --> 00:02:11.855
that a star under 
normal circumstances can't form,

00:02:11.855 --> 00:02:13.299
from silver to gold,

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.158
past lead and on to uranium.

00:02:16.158 --> 00:02:21.300
In extreme contrast to the million year
transformation of hydrogen to helium,

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.287
the creation of the heaviest 
elements in a supernova

00:02:24.287 --> 00:02:27.601
takes place in only seconds.

00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:30.977
But what becomes of the gold
after the explosion?

00:02:30.977 --> 00:02:35.505
The expanding supernova shockwave
propels its elemental debris

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:37.653
through the interstellar medium,

00:02:37.653 --> 00:02:41.031
triggering a swirling dance 
of gas and dust

00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:44.305
that condenses into new stars and planets.

00:02:44.305 --> 00:02:47.230
Earth's gold was likely delivered this way

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.819
before being kneaded into veins
by geothermal activity.

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.345
Billions of years later, we now extract
this precious product by mining it,

00:02:57.345 --> 00:03:01.043
an expensive process that's compounded
by gold's rarity.

00:03:01.043 --> 00:03:03.967
In fact, all of the gold 
that we've mined in history

00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:08.081
could be piled into 
just three Olympic-size swimming pools,

00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:10.394
although this represents a lot of mass

00:03:10.394 --> 00:03:15.186
because gold is about 20 times 
denser than water.

00:03:15.186 --> 00:03:19.490
So, can we produce more 
of this coveted commodity?

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.031
Actually, yes.

00:03:21.031 --> 00:03:25.719
Using particle accelerators, we can mimic
the complex nuclear reactions

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:28.321
that create gold in stars.

00:03:28.321 --> 00:03:32.374
But these machines can only construct gold
atom by atom.

00:03:32.374 --> 00:03:36.745
So it would take almost the age 
of the universe to produce one gram

00:03:36.745 --> 00:03:40.471
at a cost vastly exceeding 
the current value of gold.

00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:42.469
So that's not a very good solution.

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:44.709
But if we were to reach 
a hypothetical point

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.576
where we'd mined 
all of the Earth's buried gold,

00:03:47.576 --> 00:03:50.237
there are other places we could look.

00:03:50.237 --> 00:03:55.319
The ocean holds an estimated 
20 million tons of dissolved gold

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:01.237
but at extremely miniscule concentrations
making its recovery too costly at present.

00:04:01.237 --> 00:04:05.021
Perhaps one day, we'll see gold rushes
to tap the mineral wealth

00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:07.885
of the other planets of our solar system.

00:04:07.885 --> 00:04:09.044
And who knows?

00:04:09.044 --> 00:04:11.876
Maybe some future supernova 
will occur close enough

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:13.794
to shower us with its treasure

00:04:13.794 --> 00:04:17.204
and hopefully not eradicate 
all life on Earth in the process.
