00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:12.025
The human eye is an amazing mechanism,

00:00:12.025 --> 00:00:16.465
able to detect anywhere 
from a few photons to direct sunlight,

00:00:16.465 --> 00:00:19.081
or switch focus from 
the screen in front of you

00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:22.631
to the distant horizon 
in a third of a second.

00:00:22.631 --> 00:00:26.359
In fact, the structures required
for such incredible flexibility

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.368
were once considered so complex

00:00:28.368 --> 00:00:33.499
that Charles Darwin himself acknowledged
that the idea of there having evolved

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:37.456
seemed absurd in the 
highest possible degree.

00:00:37.456 --> 00:00:42.981
And yet, that is exactly what happened,
starting more than 500 million years ago.

00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:46.762
The story of the human eye begins
with a simple light spot,

00:00:46.762 --> 00:00:49.815
such as the one found 
in single-celled organisms,

00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:51.622
like euglena.

00:00:51.622 --> 00:00:53.843
This is a cluster 
of light-sensitive proteins

00:00:53.843 --> 00:00:56.412
linked to the organism's flagellum,

00:00:56.412 --> 00:01:00.022
activating when it finds light
and, therefore, food.

00:01:00.022 --> 00:01:05.037
A more complex version of this light spot
can be found in the flat worm, planaria.

00:01:05.037 --> 00:01:07.512
Being cupped, rather than flat,

00:01:07.512 --> 00:01:12.035
enables it to better sense
the direction of the incoming light.

00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:13.768
Among its other uses,

00:01:13.768 --> 00:01:19.488
this ability allows an organism
to seek out shade and hide from predators.

00:01:19.488 --> 00:01:20.602
Over the millenia,

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:23.429
as such light cups grew deeper
in some organisms,

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:26.453
the opening at the front grew smaller.

00:01:26.453 --> 00:01:31.187
The result was a pinhole effect,
which increased resolution dramatically,

00:01:31.187 --> 00:01:36.464
reducing distortion by only allowing
a thin beam of light into the eye.

00:01:36.464 --> 00:01:39.083
The nautilus, 
an ancestor of the octopus,

00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:45.148
uses this pinhole eye for improved 
resolution and directional sensing.

00:01:45.148 --> 00:01:48.559
Although the pinhole eye allows
for simple images,

00:01:48.559 --> 00:01:52.487
the key step towards the eye 
as we know it is a lens.

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:54.109
This is thought to have evolved

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:58.556
through transparent cells covering 
the opening to prevent infection,

00:01:58.556 --> 00:02:01.617
allowing the inside of the eye
to fill with fluid

00:02:01.617 --> 00:02:05.235
that optimizes light sensitivity
and processing.

00:02:05.235 --> 00:02:07.435
Crystalline proteins 
forming at the surface

00:02:07.435 --> 00:02:09.905
created a structure that proved useful

00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:13.135
in focusing light 
at a single point on the retina.

00:02:13.135 --> 00:02:17.480
It is this lens that is the key
to the eye's adaptability,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.789
changing its curvature to adapt
to near and far vision.

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:24.681
This structure of the pinhole camera
with a lens

00:02:24.681 --> 00:02:29.784
served as the basis for what would 
eventually evolve into the human eye.

00:02:29.784 --> 00:02:33.193
Further refinements would include
a colored ring, called the iris,

00:02:33.193 --> 00:02:36.694
that controls the amount 
of light entering the eye,

00:02:36.694 --> 00:02:39.982
a tough white outer layer,
known as the sclera,

00:02:39.982 --> 00:02:41.910
to maintain its structure,

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.469
and tear glands that secrete 
a protective film.

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:46.909
But equally important

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:49.489
was the accompanying evolution
of the brain,

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.501
with its expansion of the visual cortex

00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:56.157
to process the sharper
and more colorful images it was receiving.

00:02:56.157 --> 00:03:00.242
We now know that far from being
an ideal masterpiece of design,

00:03:00.242 --> 00:03:04.342
our eye bares traces
of its step by step evolution.

00:03:04.342 --> 00:03:07.561
For example,
the human retina is inverted,

00:03:07.561 --> 00:03:11.249
with light-detecting cells facing away
from the eye opening.

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:12.904
This results in a blind spot,

00:03:12.904 --> 00:03:15.626
where the optic nerve
must pierce the retina

00:03:15.626 --> 00:03:18.382
to reach the photosensitive 
layer in the back.

00:03:18.382 --> 00:03:21.528
The similar looking eyes 
of cephalopods,

00:03:21.528 --> 00:03:23.187
which evolved independently,

00:03:23.187 --> 00:03:27.970
have a front-facing retina,
allowing them to see without a blind spot.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.794
Other creatures' eyes display
different adaptations.

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:33.732
Anableps, the so called four-eyed fish,

00:03:33.732 --> 00:03:38.802
have eyes divided in two sections
for looking above and under water,

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:42.258
perfect for spotting 
both predators and prey.

00:03:42.258 --> 00:03:47.465
Cats, classically nighttime hunters,
have evolved with a reflective layer

00:03:47.465 --> 00:03:51.185
maximizing the amount of light
the eye can detect,

00:03:51.185 --> 00:03:55.715
granting them excellent night vision,
as well as their signature glow.

00:03:55.715 --> 00:04:00.468
These are just a few examples of the huge 
diversity of eyes in the animal kingdom.

00:04:00.468 --> 00:04:04.869
So if you could design an eye, 
would you do it any differently?

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:07.632
This question isn't as strange 
as it might sound.

00:04:07.632 --> 00:04:11.285
Today, doctors and scientists are looking
at different eye structures

00:04:11.285 --> 00:04:15.662
to help design biomechanical implants
for the vision impaired.

00:04:15.662 --> 00:04:18.279
And in the not so distant future,

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:22.200
the machines built with the precision
and flexibilty of the human eye

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.283
may even enable it to surpass
its own evolution.
