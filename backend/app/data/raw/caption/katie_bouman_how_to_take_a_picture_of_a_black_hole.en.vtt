00:00:13.436 --> 00:00:15.296
In the movie "Interstellar,"

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.647
we get an up-close look
at a supermassive black hole.

00:00:18.671 --> 00:00:20.814
Set against a backdrop of bright gas,

00:00:20.838 --> 00:00:22.956
the black hole's massive
gravitational pull

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.415
bends light into a ring.

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.548
However, this isn't a real photograph,

00:00:26.572 --> 00:00:28.358
but a computer graphic rendering --

00:00:28.382 --> 00:00:31.772
an artistic interpretation
of what a black hole might look like.

00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:33.567
A hundred years ago,

00:00:33.591 --> 00:00:37.192
Albert Einstein first published
his theory of general relativity.

00:00:37.216 --> 00:00:38.655
In the years since then,

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:41.652
scientists have provided
a lot of evidence in support of it.

00:00:41.676 --> 00:00:44.760
But one thing predicted
from this theory, black holes,

00:00:44.784 --> 00:00:47.134
still have not been directly observed.

00:00:47.158 --> 00:00:50.364
Although we have some idea
as to what a black hole might look like,

00:00:50.388 --> 00:00:53.167
we've never actually taken
a picture of one before.

00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:57.470
However, you might be surprised to know
that that may soon change.

00:00:57.494 --> 00:01:01.658
We may be seeing our first picture
of a black hole in the next couple years.

00:01:01.682 --> 00:01:05.640
Getting this first picture will come down
to an international team of scientists,

00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:07.231
an Earth-sized telescope

00:01:07.255 --> 00:01:10.087
and an algorithm that puts together
the final picture.

00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:13.639
Although I won't be able to show you
a real picture of a black hole today,

00:01:13.663 --> 00:01:16.574
I'd like to give you a brief glimpse
into the effort involved

00:01:16.598 --> 00:01:18.211
in getting that first picture.

00:01:19.477 --> 00:01:20.914
My name is Katie Bouman,

00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:23.504
and I'm a PhD student at MIT.

00:01:23.528 --> 00:01:25.555
I do research in a computer science lab

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:28.877
that works on making computers
see through images and video.

00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:31.063
But although I'm not an astronomer,

00:01:31.087 --> 00:01:32.372
today I'd like to show you

00:01:32.396 --> 00:01:35.299
how I've been able to contribute
to this exciting project.

00:01:35.323 --> 00:01:38.154
If you go out past
the bright city lights tonight,

00:01:38.178 --> 00:01:40.614
you may just be lucky enough
to see a stunning view

00:01:40.638 --> 00:01:42.131
of the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:01:42.155 --> 00:01:44.617
And if you could zoom past
millions of stars,

00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:48.396
26,000 light-years toward the heart
of the spiraling Milky Way,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.941
we'd eventually reach
a cluster of stars right at the center.

00:01:51.965 --> 00:01:55.171
Peering past all the galactic dust
with infrared telescopes,

00:01:55.195 --> 00:01:59.062
astronomers have watched these stars
for over 16 years.

00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:02.675
But it's what they don't see
that is the most spectacular.

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:05.765
These stars seem to orbit
an invisible object.

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.112
By tracking the paths of these stars,

00:02:08.136 --> 00:02:09.430
astronomers have concluded

00:02:09.454 --> 00:02:12.583
that the only thing small and heavy
enough to cause this motion

00:02:12.607 --> 00:02:14.575
is a supermassive black hole --

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.777
an object so dense that it sucks up
anything that ventures too close --

00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:20.295
even light.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.380
But what happens if we were
to zoom in even further?

00:02:23.404 --> 00:02:28.137
Is it possible to see something
that, by definition, is impossible to see?

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.963
Well, it turns out that if we were
to zoom in at radio wavelengths,

00:02:31.987 --> 00:02:33.669
we'd expect to see a ring of light

00:02:33.693 --> 00:02:36.104
caused by the gravitational
lensing of hot plasma

00:02:36.128 --> 00:02:37.957
zipping around the black hole.

00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:39.141
In other words,

00:02:39.165 --> 00:02:42.336
the black hole casts a shadow
on this backdrop of bright material,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.202
carving out a sphere of darkness.

00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:47.565
This bright ring reveals
the black hole's event horizon,

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:49.989
where the gravitational pull
becomes so great

00:02:50.013 --> 00:02:51.639
that not even light can escape.

00:02:51.663 --> 00:02:54.522
Einstein's equations predict
the size and shape of this ring,

00:02:54.546 --> 00:02:57.754
so taking a picture of it
wouldn't only be really cool,

00:02:57.778 --> 00:03:00.396
it would also help to verify
that these equations hold

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.886
in the extreme conditions
around the black hole.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.468
However, this black hole
is so far away from us,

00:03:05.492 --> 00:03:08.590
that from Earth, this ring appears
incredibly small --

00:03:08.614 --> 00:03:12.204
the same size to us as an orange
on the surface of the moon.

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:15.582
That makes taking a picture of it
extremely difficult.

00:03:16.645 --> 00:03:17.947
Why is that?

00:03:18.512 --> 00:03:21.700
Well, it all comes down
to a simple equation.

00:03:21.724 --> 00:03:24.140
Due to a phenomenon called diffraction,

00:03:24.164 --> 00:03:25.519
there are fundamental limits

00:03:25.543 --> 00:03:28.213
to the smallest objects
that we can possibly see.

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:32.461
This governing equation says
that in order to see smaller and smaller,

00:03:32.485 --> 00:03:35.072
we need to make our telescope
bigger and bigger.

00:03:35.096 --> 00:03:38.165
But even with the most powerful
optical telescopes here on Earth,

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.608
we can't even get close
to the resolution necessary

00:03:40.632 --> 00:03:42.830
to image on the surface of the moon.

00:03:42.854 --> 00:03:46.471
In fact, here I show one of the highest
resolution images ever taken

00:03:46.495 --> 00:03:47.892
of the moon from Earth.

00:03:47.916 --> 00:03:50.473
It contains roughly 13,000 pixels,

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:54.547
and yet each pixel would contain
over 1.5 million oranges.

00:03:55.396 --> 00:03:57.368
So how big of a telescope do we need

00:03:57.392 --> 00:04:00.157
in order to see an orange
on the surface of the moon

00:04:00.181 --> 00:04:02.395
and, by extension, our black hole?

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.759
Well, it turns out
that by crunching the numbers,

00:04:04.783 --> 00:04:07.393
you can easily calculate
that we would need a telescope

00:04:07.417 --> 00:04:08.810
the size of the entire Earth.

00:04:08.834 --> 00:04:09.858
(Laughter)

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:12.001
If we could build
this Earth-sized telescope,

00:04:12.025 --> 00:04:14.950
we could just start to make out
that distinctive ring of light

00:04:14.974 --> 00:04:17.157
indicative of the black
hole's event horizon.

00:04:17.181 --> 00:04:20.099
Although this picture wouldn't contain
all the detail we see

00:04:20.123 --> 00:04:21.629
in computer graphic renderings,

00:04:21.653 --> 00:04:23.952
it would allow us to safely get
our first glimpse

00:04:23.976 --> 00:04:26.463
of the immediate environment
around a black hole.

00:04:26.487 --> 00:04:28.100
However, as you can imagine,

00:04:28.124 --> 00:04:31.748
building a single-dish telescope
the size of the Earth is impossible.

00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:33.659
But in the famous words of Mick Jagger,

00:04:33.683 --> 00:04:35.474
"You can't always get what you want,

00:04:35.498 --> 00:04:37.685
but if you try sometimes,
you just might find

00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:38.924
you get what you need."

00:04:38.948 --> 00:04:41.412
And by connecting telescopes
from around the world,

00:04:41.436 --> 00:04:44.974
an international collaboration
called the Event Horizon Telescope

00:04:44.998 --> 00:04:48.107
is creating a computational telescope
the size of the Earth,

00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:49.668
capable of resolving structure

00:04:49.692 --> 00:04:51.891
on the scale of a black
hole's event horizon.

00:04:51.915 --> 00:04:55.302
This network of telescopes is scheduled
to take its very first picture

00:04:55.326 --> 00:04:57.141
of a black hole next year.

00:04:57.165 --> 00:05:00.503
Each telescope in the worldwide
network works together.

00:05:00.527 --> 00:05:03.239
Linked through the precise timing
of atomic clocks,

00:05:03.263 --> 00:05:05.920
teams of researchers at each
of the sites freeze light

00:05:05.944 --> 00:05:08.906
by collecting thousands
of terabytes of data.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.947
This data is then processed in a lab
right here in Massachusetts.

00:05:13.971 --> 00:05:15.765
So how does this even work?

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.192
Remember if we want to see the black hole
in the center of our galaxy,

00:05:19.216 --> 00:05:22.198
we need to build this impossibly large
Earth-sized telescope?

00:05:22.222 --> 00:05:24.454
For just a second,
let's pretend we could build

00:05:24.478 --> 00:05:26.320
a telescope the size of the Earth.

00:05:26.344 --> 00:05:28.799
This would be a little bit
like turning the Earth

00:05:28.823 --> 00:05:30.570
into a giant spinning disco ball.

00:05:30.594 --> 00:05:32.794
Each individual mirror would collect light

00:05:32.818 --> 00:05:35.415
that we could then combine
together to make a picture.

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:38.100
However, now let's say
we remove most of those mirrors

00:05:38.124 --> 00:05:40.096
so only a few remained.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.997
We could still try to combine
this information together,

00:05:43.021 --> 00:05:45.014
but now there are a lot of holes.

00:05:45.038 --> 00:05:49.411
These remaining mirrors represent
the locations where we have telescopes.

00:05:49.435 --> 00:05:53.514
This is an incredibly small number
of measurements to make a picture from.

00:05:53.538 --> 00:05:57.376
But although we only collect light
at a few telescope locations,

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.823
as the Earth rotates, we get to see
other new measurements.

00:06:00.847 --> 00:06:04.666
In other words, as the disco ball spins,
those mirrors change locations

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.589
and we get to observe
different parts of the image.

00:06:07.613 --> 00:06:11.631
The imaging algorithms we develop
fill in the missing gaps of the disco ball

00:06:11.655 --> 00:06:14.688
in order to reconstruct
the underlying black hole image.

00:06:14.712 --> 00:06:17.348
If we had telescopes located
everywhere on the globe --

00:06:17.372 --> 00:06:19.313
in other words, the entire disco ball --

00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:20.621
this would be trivial.

00:06:20.645 --> 00:06:23.967
However, we only see a few samples,
and for that reason,

00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:26.379
there are an infinite number
of possible images

00:06:26.403 --> 00:06:29.367
that are perfectly consistent
with our telescope measurements.

00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:32.407
However, not all images are created equal.

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:37.307
Some of those images look more like
what we think of as images than others.

00:06:37.331 --> 00:06:40.553
And so, my role in helping to take
the first image of a black hole

00:06:40.577 --> 00:06:43.509
is to design algorithms that find
the most reasonable image

00:06:43.533 --> 00:06:45.755
that also fits the telescope measurements.

00:06:46.727 --> 00:06:50.669
Just as a forensic sketch artist
uses limited descriptions

00:06:50.693 --> 00:06:54.207
to piece together a picture using
their knowledge of face structure,

00:06:54.231 --> 00:06:57.546
the imaging algorithms I develop
use our limited telescope data

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.892
to guide us to a picture that also
looks like stuff in our universe.

00:07:01.916 --> 00:07:05.567
Using these algorithms,
we're able to piece together pictures

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:07.771
from this sparse, noisy data.

00:07:07.795 --> 00:07:12.324
So here I show a sample reconstruction
done using simulated data,

00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:14.281
when we pretend to point our telescopes

00:07:14.305 --> 00:07:16.890
to the black hole
in the center of our galaxy.

00:07:16.914 --> 00:07:21.369
Although this is just a simulation,
reconstruction such as this give us hope

00:07:21.393 --> 00:07:24.846
that we'll soon be able to reliably take
the first image of a black hole

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.465
and from it, determine
the size of its ring.

00:07:28.118 --> 00:07:31.317
Although I'd love to go on
about all the details of this algorithm,

00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:33.515
luckily for you, I don't have the time.

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:35.540
But I'd still like
to give you a brief idea

00:07:35.564 --> 00:07:37.866
of how we define
what our universe looks like,

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:42.356
and how we use this to reconstruct
and verify our results.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.876
Since there are an infinite number
of possible images

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.265
that perfectly explain
our telescope measurements,

00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:49.894
we have to choose
between them in some way.

00:07:49.918 --> 00:07:51.756
We do this by ranking the images

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.614
based upon how likely they are
to be the black hole image,

00:07:54.638 --> 00:07:57.120
and then choosing the one
that's most likely.

00:07:57.144 --> 00:07:59.339
So what do I mean by this exactly?

00:07:59.862 --> 00:08:01.840
Let's say we were trying to make a model

00:08:01.864 --> 00:08:05.047
that told us how likely an image
were to appear on Facebook.

00:08:05.071 --> 00:08:06.772
We'd probably want the model to say

00:08:06.796 --> 00:08:10.353
it's pretty unlikely that someone
would post this noise image on the left,

00:08:10.377 --> 00:08:12.796
and pretty likely that someone
would post a selfie

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.154
like this one on the right.

00:08:14.178 --> 00:08:15.817
The image in the middle is blurry,

00:08:15.841 --> 00:08:18.480
so even though it's more likely
we'd see it on Facebook

00:08:18.504 --> 00:08:19.864
compared to the noise image,

00:08:19.888 --> 00:08:22.848
it's probably less likely we'd see it
compared to the selfie.

00:08:22.872 --> 00:08:25.162
But when it comes to images
from the black hole,

00:08:25.186 --> 00:08:28.688
we're posed with a real conundrum:
we've never seen a black hole before.

00:08:28.712 --> 00:08:31.003
In that case, what is a likely
black hole image,

00:08:31.027 --> 00:08:33.965
and what should we assume
about the structure of black holes?

00:08:33.989 --> 00:08:36.621
We could try to use images
from simulations we've done,

00:08:36.645 --> 00:08:39.175
like the image of the black hole
from "Interstellar,"

00:08:39.199 --> 00:08:42.137
but if we did this,
it could cause some serious problems.

00:08:42.161 --> 00:08:45.541
What would happen
if Einstein's theories didn't hold?

00:08:45.565 --> 00:08:49.526
We'd still want to reconstruct
an accurate picture of what was going on.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.921
If we bake Einstein's equations
too much into our algorithms,

00:08:52.945 --> 00:08:55.700
we'll just end up seeing
what we expect to see.

00:08:55.724 --> 00:08:58.000
In other words,
we want to leave the option open

00:08:58.024 --> 00:09:00.947
for there being a giant elephant
at the center of our galaxy.

00:09:00.971 --> 00:09:02.028
(Laughter)

00:09:02.052 --> 00:09:05.041
Different types of images have
very distinct features.

00:09:05.065 --> 00:09:08.613
We can easily tell the difference
between black hole simulation images

00:09:08.637 --> 00:09:10.913
and images we take
every day here on Earth.

00:09:10.937 --> 00:09:14.041
We need a way to tell our algorithms
what images look like

00:09:14.065 --> 00:09:17.314
without imposing one type
of image's features too much.

00:09:17.865 --> 00:09:19.758
One way we can try to get around this

00:09:19.782 --> 00:09:22.844
is by imposing the features
of different kinds of images

00:09:22.868 --> 00:09:26.998
and seeing how the type of image we assume
affects our reconstructions.

00:09:27.712 --> 00:09:31.203
If all images' types produce
a very similar-looking image,

00:09:31.227 --> 00:09:33.284
then we can start to become more confident

00:09:33.308 --> 00:09:37.481
that the image assumptions we're making
are not biasing this picture that much.

00:09:37.505 --> 00:09:40.495
This is a little bit like
giving the same description

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:43.515
to three different sketch artists
from all around the world.

00:09:43.539 --> 00:09:46.399
If they all produce
a very similar-looking face,

00:09:46.423 --> 00:09:48.216
then we can start to become confident

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.856
that they're not imposing their own
cultural biases on the drawings.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:55.195
One way we can try to impose
different image features

00:09:55.219 --> 00:09:57.660
is by using pieces of existing images.

00:09:58.214 --> 00:10:00.374
So we take a large collection of images,

00:10:00.398 --> 00:10:03.116
and we break them down
into their little image patches.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:07.425
We then can treat each image patch
a little bit like pieces of a puzzle.

00:10:07.449 --> 00:10:11.727
And we use commonly seen puzzle pieces
to piece together an image

00:10:11.751 --> 00:10:14.203
that also fits our telescope measurements.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.783
Different types of images have
very distinctive sets of puzzle pieces.

00:10:18.807 --> 00:10:21.613
So what happens when we take the same data

00:10:21.637 --> 00:10:25.767
but we use different sets of puzzle pieces
to reconstruct the image?

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:30.557
Let's first start with black hole
image simulation puzzle pieces.

00:10:30.581 --> 00:10:32.172
OK, this looks reasonable.

00:10:32.196 --> 00:10:34.890
This looks like what we expect
a black hole to look like.

00:10:34.914 --> 00:10:36.107
But did we just get it

00:10:36.131 --> 00:10:39.445
because we just fed it little pieces
of black hole simulation images?

00:10:39.469 --> 00:10:41.349
Let's try another set of puzzle pieces

00:10:41.373 --> 00:10:43.882
from astronomical, non-black hole objects.

00:10:44.914 --> 00:10:47.040
OK, we get a similar-looking image.

00:10:47.064 --> 00:10:49.300
And then how about pieces
from everyday images,

00:10:49.324 --> 00:10:52.109
like the images you take
with your own personal camera?

00:10:53.312 --> 00:10:55.427
Great, we see the same image.

00:10:55.451 --> 00:10:58.817
When we get the same image
from all different sets of puzzle pieces,

00:10:58.841 --> 00:11:00.887
then we can start to become more confident

00:11:00.911 --> 00:11:02.877
that the image assumptions we're making

00:11:02.901 --> 00:11:05.822
aren't biasing the final
image we get too much.

00:11:05.846 --> 00:11:09.099
Another thing we can do is take
the same set of puzzle pieces,

00:11:09.123 --> 00:11:11.612
such as the ones derived
from everyday images,

00:11:11.636 --> 00:11:15.236
and use them to reconstruct
many different kinds of source images.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.531
So in our simulations,

00:11:16.555 --> 00:11:20.330
we pretend a black hole looks like
astronomical non-black hole objects,

00:11:20.354 --> 00:11:24.203
as well as everyday images like
the elephant in the center of our galaxy.

00:11:24.227 --> 00:11:27.395
When the results of our algorithms
on the bottom look very similar

00:11:27.419 --> 00:11:29.515
to the simulation's truth image on top,

00:11:29.539 --> 00:11:32.885
then we can start to become
more confident in our algorithms.

00:11:32.909 --> 00:11:34.776
And I really want to emphasize here

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.734
that all of these pictures were created

00:11:36.758 --> 00:11:39.694
by piecing together little pieces
of everyday photographs,

00:11:39.718 --> 00:11:41.933
like you'd take with your own
personal camera.

00:11:41.957 --> 00:11:45.233
So an image of a black hole
we've never seen before

00:11:45.257 --> 00:11:49.200
may eventually be created by piecing
together pictures we see all the time

00:11:49.224 --> 00:11:51.969
of people, buildings,
trees, cats and dogs.

00:11:51.993 --> 00:11:54.638
Imaging ideas like this
will make it possible for us

00:11:54.662 --> 00:11:57.281
to take our very first pictures
of a black hole,

00:11:57.305 --> 00:11:59.752
and hopefully, verify
those famous theories

00:11:59.776 --> 00:12:02.197
on which scientists rely on a daily basis.

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:04.829
But of course, getting
imaging ideas like this working

00:12:04.853 --> 00:12:08.175
would never have been possible
without the amazing team of researchers

00:12:08.199 --> 00:12:10.086
that I have the privilege to work with.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:11.273
It still amazes me

00:12:11.297 --> 00:12:14.648
that although I began this project
with no background in astrophysics,

00:12:14.672 --> 00:12:17.291
what we have achieved
through this unique collaboration

00:12:17.315 --> 00:12:20.074
could result in the very first
images of a black hole.

00:12:20.098 --> 00:12:22.796
But big projects like
the Event Horizon Telescope

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.634
are successful due to all
the interdisciplinary expertise

00:12:25.658 --> 00:12:27.448
different people bring to the table.

00:12:27.472 --> 00:12:29.178
We're a melting pot of astronomers,

00:12:29.202 --> 00:12:31.434
physicists, mathematicians and engineers.

00:12:31.458 --> 00:12:34.012
This is what will make it soon possible

00:12:34.036 --> 00:12:36.889
to achieve something
once thought impossible.

00:12:36.913 --> 00:12:39.169
I'd like to encourage all of you to go out

00:12:39.193 --> 00:12:41.289
and help push the boundaries of science,

00:12:41.313 --> 00:12:45.214
even if it may at first seem
as mysterious to you as a black hole.

00:12:45.238 --> 00:12:46.412
Thank you.

00:12:46.436 --> 00:12:48.833
(Applause)
