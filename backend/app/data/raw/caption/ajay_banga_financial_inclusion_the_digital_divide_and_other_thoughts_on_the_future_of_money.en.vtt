00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:16.518
Whitney Pennington Rodgers: Ajay Banga,
thank you so much for being with us today.

00:00:16.542 --> 00:00:20.768
I feel like this conversation
is especially meaningful

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:24.559
as we're wading through
this pandemic, it's late 2020,

00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:31.351
and we've seen the way that inequalities
have presented themselves

00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:34.059
throughout this year, through this crisis.

00:00:34.083 --> 00:00:36.601
And since you've been
at the helm of Mastercard,

00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:40.518
you have championed this idea
of financial inclusion.

00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:42.934
And so, could you start
by telling us a little bit

00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.434
about financial inclusion,

00:00:44.458 --> 00:00:45.726
what is it

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.559
and why do you think this is something
that can change people's lives?

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:53.309
Ajay Banga: Yes, look,
I think that the COVID-19 crisis

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:56.268
has actually made things
worse in some ways

00:00:56.292 --> 00:00:59.059
and some of the advances
that were being made

00:00:59.083 --> 00:01:00.476
over the prior decade

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.518
on fighting poverty and fighting exclusion

00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:06.476
have probably got set back a little bit,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.024
just by the nature of the manner

00:01:08.048 --> 00:01:12.309
in which the virus has impacted
minorities and disadvantaged people

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:13.768
more than they have others,

00:01:13.792 --> 00:01:16.226
including, by the way,
minority-owned businesses,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.643
a number of whom have had
disproportionate impact

00:01:18.667 --> 00:01:19.934
through the crisis.

00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.101
But I guess if you pull back
from the crisis,

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:25.309
because financial inclusion or exclusion

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:29.500
is an underlying social problem
that dates back to well before this.

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:33.292
The real issue,
here's the theory of the case.

00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:36.559
Of seven billion people in the world,

00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:42.809
close to two billion are either
underbanked or unbanked in some way.

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:45.059
And what I mean
by underbanked or unbanked --

00:01:45.083 --> 00:01:46.351
unbanked is obvious,

00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:50.184
they don't have a relationship
with a banking institution of any type.

00:01:50.208 --> 00:01:51.476
Of any type.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.476
Now, underbanked is, even if they do,

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.601
they're not getting to participate
in the financial mainstream

00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:00.434
and do things that you and I
take for granted,

00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:03.601
which means being able to access credit

00:02:03.625 --> 00:02:06.268
when you need it, at a reasonable price,

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.768
being able to access insurance

00:02:08.792 --> 00:02:10.893
of the type that's relevant to you,

00:02:10.917 --> 00:02:12.809
being able to do things of that nature,

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:15.601
save for a rainy day in the right way.

00:02:15.625 --> 00:02:19.018
All that done in a form
that's good for you as the consumer.

00:02:19.042 --> 00:02:20.309
That's underbanked.

00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:22.809
And so, a couple of billion
people around the world,

00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:24.643
this is World Bank statistics,

00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:26.768
are basically unbanked or underbanked,

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:29.434
and most of those people

00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:32.934
do not have a formal identity

00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:36.434
that they had received
or got from their government

00:02:36.458 --> 00:02:39.809
and therefore, there's nothing
they can take and hold out

00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:42.226
to show when they go to hire a car

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.518
or live in a hotel

00:02:43.542 --> 00:02:45.476
or take a flight, which they don't do,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.184
to show that they exist in the system.

00:02:48.208 --> 00:02:49.726
Their opinions don't count,

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.309
they don't get counted
in censuses very often,

00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:56.184
they don't get counted for their opinion
of what government should be doing,

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:59.143
they get left out, they're locked out.

00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:01.059
And the last part of that puzzle

00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:03.601
is that this is too big an issue,

00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:04.893
over the years,

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:06.643
for just a government to solve,

00:03:06.667 --> 00:03:09.726
or for just one bank
to solve in a country.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.101
It does require, kind of,
a bunch of shoulders at the wheel

00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:15.393
to come together,

00:03:15.417 --> 00:03:18.601
it requires partnerships across
the public and the private sector,

00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:20.476
but even within the private sector,

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.958
to get to make a real
movement on this issue.

00:03:25.542 --> 00:03:27.518
WPR: So if I'm understanding correctly,

00:03:27.542 --> 00:03:31.101
it sounds like it's just an opportunity
for people no matter where you are,

00:03:31.125 --> 00:03:34.643
what your socioeconomic status is,

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:37.268
that you have access
to financial services,

00:03:37.292 --> 00:03:41.143
that you are part of the system
and you have a place,

00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:43.018
a financial identity.

00:03:43.042 --> 00:03:44.976
AB: You have identity, you have a voice,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.851
you have access to financial services.

00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:49.393
So financial inclusion
has got so many facets,

00:03:49.417 --> 00:03:53.893
but the basic facet is
be counted, be included,

00:03:53.917 --> 00:03:56.476
be somebody, have the dignity
of your identity,

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.768
and of being included.

00:03:57.792 --> 00:04:00.226
That's really what financial inclusion is.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.393
WPR: It seems like such a simple idea,

00:04:03.417 --> 00:04:05.309
that can potentially have a big impact,

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:08.059
and I know that this is something
that you've implemented

00:04:08.083 --> 00:04:09.851
in your work at Mastercard,

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:12.893
but also we see this
in many other organizations,

00:04:12.917 --> 00:04:17.726
so talk a little bit about what does
financial inclusion look like in practice

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.101
for a range of different organizations

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:22.101
and a range of different spaces.

00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:23.393
AB: First of all,

00:04:23.417 --> 00:04:26.476
you're absolutely correct,
there are lots of people participating

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.809
in trying to change this.

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:30.809
And honestly, without that,
we wouldn't get anywhere.

00:04:30.833 --> 00:04:32.101
We're doing our bit,

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:34.840
but what we're doing
is really in partnership with others,

00:04:34.864 --> 00:04:37.055
because we're not
a direct-to-consumer company.

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:40.726
There's nothing I can do
to improve your life directly

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.184
in terms of being included

00:04:42.208 --> 00:04:44.809
because I don't open bank accounts,

00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:46.434
I don't give credit,

00:04:46.458 --> 00:04:48.684
I don't underwrite insurance

00:04:48.708 --> 00:04:51.726
and I don't have a way
to provide you ways to save money

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.184
in a mutual fund or anything.

00:04:53.208 --> 00:04:54.809
For me to do anything,

00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:56.351
I need to have banks,

00:04:56.375 --> 00:04:57.809
I need to have fintechs,

00:04:57.833 --> 00:04:59.726
I need to have mobile phone companies,

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.059
I need to have governments,

00:05:01.083 --> 00:05:02.726
I probably need to have merchants

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.643
and that ecosystem
of the coalition of the willing

00:05:07.667 --> 00:05:10.143
is kind of what you will see represented

00:05:10.167 --> 00:05:12.768
when different companies
talk about their role

00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:14.268
in financial inclusion.

00:05:14.292 --> 00:05:16.726
Let me give you
a couple of tangible examples.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.018
So if you're a farmer

00:05:18.042 --> 00:05:22.143
and you've got to go to sell
your produce when it's harvested,

00:05:22.167 --> 00:05:25.643
you've got to go two days' way
to the nearest village market,

00:05:25.667 --> 00:05:28.893
well then, everybody knows
that on the way back you're carrying cash

00:05:28.917 --> 00:05:30.226
from the produce you sold.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.893
That normally leads to bad outcomes.

00:05:32.917 --> 00:05:35.018
Also, you've got to go buy fertilizer.

00:05:35.042 --> 00:05:37.393
Or you've got to go
back and forth to do all this

00:05:37.417 --> 00:05:38.934
and you're really unproductive,

00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:41.184
or you send your spouse to do it.

00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:43.518
All that changes if I can connect you

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:44.809
with a phone

00:05:44.833 --> 00:05:48.018
into farmers, fertilizers
and cooperatives,

00:05:48.042 --> 00:05:49.809
give you cropping information,

00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:51.476
rainfall information,

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.268
enable you to sell your produce
in a better marketplace, online,

00:05:55.292 --> 00:05:58.226
receive the money into an account online,

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.809
that is a complete game changer.

00:06:00.833 --> 00:06:03.768
Something again
that farmer's cooperatives,

00:06:03.792 --> 00:06:05.309
local governments,

00:06:05.333 --> 00:06:08.434
banks and companies like ours
can help facilitate,

00:06:08.458 --> 00:06:10.643
in Africa, we're doing it in India,

00:06:10.667 --> 00:06:13.309
we're doing it in a bunch
of countries around the world.

00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:16.184
Again, the idea here
is to take you out of the cash economy

00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:19.434
and give you access
to an electronic economy.

00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:21.018
Imagine that same farmer,

00:06:21.042 --> 00:06:23.934
they now receive money for their produce,

00:06:23.958 --> 00:06:27.809
a bank can look at how they spend money
out of their account,

00:06:27.833 --> 00:06:31.976
and could, using the spending
and receiving of money,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.309
underwrite you much better for a crop loan

00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:38.042
than they could if they
didn't know anything about you.

00:06:39.083 --> 00:06:41.393
So the same example, another one,

00:06:41.417 --> 00:06:44.059
is for small and microbusinesses.

00:06:44.083 --> 00:06:48.851
Take a woman in Kenya
or in India or in Mexico in a village

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:52.059
who opens a small shop outside her home

00:06:52.083 --> 00:06:54.601
when her husband and children are away.

00:06:54.625 --> 00:06:56.393
And it runs for a few hours in a day,

00:06:56.417 --> 00:06:59.643
and she stocks a little baby food,
and soap and toilet paper

00:06:59.667 --> 00:07:02.143
and whatever else people buy there.

00:07:02.167 --> 00:07:04.018
Well when the company van comes,

00:07:04.042 --> 00:07:08.434
the Nestle van, the Unilever van,
the local Bimbo Bread van,

00:07:08.458 --> 00:07:10.268
comes to sell produce to her

00:07:10.292 --> 00:07:13.101
on a Monday or a Tuesday
or a Wednesday at a certain time,

00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:15.101
she buys what she can in cash.

00:07:15.125 --> 00:07:18.143
Typically, she's in the cash economy,
nobody’s given her credit,

00:07:18.167 --> 00:07:21.559
she runs out of cash
for that produce that she's buying

00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:23.101
before the week is over.

00:07:23.125 --> 00:07:25.768
She's out of stock. She loses sales.

00:07:25.792 --> 00:07:27.851
Imagine if she could then be underwritten,

00:07:27.875 --> 00:07:29.684
digitizing that supply chain,

00:07:29.708 --> 00:07:31.684
what she bought, what she sold,

00:07:31.708 --> 00:07:33.226
underwrite her in a bank

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.143
with actual transaction history,

00:07:35.167 --> 00:07:36.934
you could lend her the 500 dollars

00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.851
to enable her to be smarter
about what she buys,

00:07:39.875 --> 00:07:42.351
educate her on how to use her credit,

00:07:42.375 --> 00:07:43.726
that's financial inclusion.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.893
WPR: And so one thing
that's really struck me

00:07:45.917 --> 00:07:48.809
as you're talking through
what financial inclusion looks like

00:07:48.833 --> 00:07:50.101
and how it works,

00:07:50.125 --> 00:07:52.059
is the dependency on technology,

00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:54.309
on smartphones, on internet access,

00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:56.018
and we know that this is something

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:58.601
that a lot of people
struggle to have access to this

00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:01.184
in developing nations,
even in developed countries.

00:08:01.208 --> 00:08:06.934
Talk a little bit about how this might
in some ways increase the digital divide,

00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.934
and sort of, how you respond
to people who might criticize

00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.809
this idea in that way.

00:08:11.833 --> 00:08:14.101
AB: There are two topics
you just came across,

00:08:14.125 --> 00:08:16.518
the digital divide,
which I think is a real issue.

00:08:16.542 --> 00:08:18.934
But just to be clear,
all the examples I gave you,

00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:23.184
they work on smartphones
and they work on old flip phones as well.

00:08:23.208 --> 00:08:25.893
That QR code, if you have
a camera on your smartphone,

00:08:25.917 --> 00:08:27.184
you can take it,

00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:29.018
but there's a numerical number there,

00:08:29.042 --> 00:08:32.226
you could enter that number
into your finger phone

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:33.851
and get it across as well.

00:08:33.875 --> 00:08:35.518
Examples like that in Egypt,

00:08:35.542 --> 00:08:38.143
where we've opened
mobile wallets on phones,

00:08:38.167 --> 00:08:40.018
they don't have to be on a smartphone,

00:08:40.042 --> 00:08:41.434
it could be on an old phone.

00:08:41.458 --> 00:08:44.809
So to be clear, these financial
inclusion examples

00:08:44.833 --> 00:08:47.393
do not depend on smartphones,

00:08:47.417 --> 00:08:51.684
they do not depend on just
internet access in your house,

00:08:51.708 --> 00:08:54.059
you do need a phone, a cell phone,

00:08:54.083 --> 00:08:56.018
in a number of the examples I gave you.

00:08:56.042 --> 00:09:00.268
But in the case of the micro
and small credit enterprises,

00:09:00.292 --> 00:09:01.684
you don't even need a phone.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.226
That actually is just
the transaction history

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.643
of the produce you bought
and what you sold getting digitized

00:09:07.667 --> 00:09:09.434
and a bank being able to underwrite.

00:09:09.458 --> 00:09:12.309
There are other problems
of infrastructure in those

00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:13.643
that we can talk about.

00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:16.226
But to be specific
about the digital divide,

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.059
I think that's another real big issue

00:09:18.083 --> 00:09:21.143
and again, COVID-19
has actually, unfortunately,

00:09:21.167 --> 00:09:26.143
exposed what was already
sort of an issue in society.

00:09:26.167 --> 00:09:29.351
So whether it's rural parts of America,

00:09:29.375 --> 00:09:35.559
let alone an African or Indian
or Indonesian or Guatemalan example,

00:09:35.583 --> 00:09:38.101
in America, in rural parts of America,

00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:39.643
broadband access is a problem.

00:09:39.667 --> 00:09:42.226
Disadvantaged children in New York City,

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.768
who may not have access
to the same bandwidth capacity

00:09:45.792 --> 00:09:49.559
or computers that they need
to be able to participate in education,

00:09:49.583 --> 00:09:50.851
that's a problem.

00:09:50.875 --> 00:09:53.601
And so, that's a separate issue, Whitney,

00:09:53.625 --> 00:09:56.809
from the issue of some
of the examples I gave you,

00:09:56.833 --> 00:09:59.851
which I think can actually
be operated equally well

00:09:59.875 --> 00:10:01.643
with old-fashioned phones.

00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:04.851
WPR: It seems like a precursor to this

00:10:04.875 --> 00:10:08.393
is in talking about these partnerships
with governments, perhaps,

00:10:08.417 --> 00:10:11.351
is making sure people do have
even access to a flip phone

00:10:11.375 --> 00:10:13.976
or some sort of way
that they can communicate

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.226
so they can participate
in these initiatives.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.309
AB: So I think a phone is transformational

00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:23.476
and the fact is that there are many
people in the world with a phone,

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.143
but there's still a billion people

00:10:25.167 --> 00:10:28.018
who do not have the right kind
of phone or internet access.

00:10:28.042 --> 00:10:29.309
That's a different topic.

00:10:29.333 --> 00:10:32.101
So that said, you've got to find ways
to reach them too.

00:10:32.125 --> 00:10:33.976
You can't only do it by phone.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.184
So the example of those micro SMEs
I was talking about,

00:10:37.208 --> 00:10:39.101
they've got nothing to do with a phone.

00:10:39.125 --> 00:10:41.184
Or for example, in South Africa,

00:10:41.208 --> 00:10:43.559
with the social security administration

00:10:43.583 --> 00:10:46.809
where the government gives them
a certain amount of money every year

00:10:46.833 --> 00:10:49.518
for their being not employed,

00:10:49.542 --> 00:10:52.768
you can actually reach them
through a biometric card,

00:10:52.792 --> 00:10:54.059
which is what we've done,

00:10:54.083 --> 00:10:56.893
with the government,
the government collects your identity,

00:10:56.917 --> 00:10:58.184
your biometrics on a card,

00:10:58.208 --> 00:11:00.476
and we can load the card remotely

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.351
with the amount they want to transfer,

00:11:02.375 --> 00:11:04.684
take out the middleman in the process,

00:11:04.708 --> 00:11:06.143
and allow that person

00:11:06.167 --> 00:11:09.351
to then use that card to go to an ATM
to take out their cash,

00:11:09.375 --> 00:11:11.518
or go straight to a shop to shop.

00:11:11.542 --> 00:11:13.309
And I think that changes everything.

00:11:13.333 --> 00:11:15.143
So we've done that in many countries.

00:11:15.167 --> 00:11:19.184
And so if you go to where Syrian refugees
were coming in to Lebanon

00:11:19.208 --> 00:11:20.643
and Greece and the like,

00:11:20.667 --> 00:11:22.851
every aid agency there

00:11:22.875 --> 00:11:25.726
would require them
to have an identity with them

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:29.208
to get access to whatever form of aid
they were dispersing.

00:11:30.417 --> 00:11:32.976
One of the things we're doing
is to convert that

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.434
into a very simple
biometric-enabled identity

00:11:36.458 --> 00:11:39.351
which will be read across aid agencies,

00:11:39.375 --> 00:11:42.851
so you or I don't need to get
our identity verified

00:11:42.875 --> 00:11:44.226
separately each time.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.726
There is a statistic in the world
that 40 percent of the dollars

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.768
that governments want to spend
to reach their citizenry

00:11:50.792 --> 00:11:52.518
for social benefit programs

00:11:52.542 --> 00:11:54.018
never reach them.

00:11:54.042 --> 00:11:55.393
They are called leakage.

00:11:55.417 --> 00:11:57.643
Leakage means administrative costs

00:11:57.667 --> 00:11:59.559
and I call it theft.

00:11:59.583 --> 00:12:01.518
Because it's 40 less cents on a dollar

00:12:01.542 --> 00:12:04.518
for the person who cannot afford
even one cent less.

00:12:04.542 --> 00:12:05.809
That's the issue.

00:12:05.833 --> 00:12:07.726
That's what we're trying to solve for.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.809
Take out middlemen,
use technology to help,

00:12:09.833 --> 00:12:13.351
enable a direct government
to citizenry operation,

00:12:13.375 --> 00:12:16.851
allow banks and NGOs and foreign companies

00:12:16.875 --> 00:12:18.434
to intervene in the right way,

00:12:18.458 --> 00:12:20.851
as in the example of this refugee crisis.

00:12:20.875 --> 00:12:23.809
The World Food Programme distributes food

00:12:23.833 --> 00:12:26.559
in those very refugee camps.

00:12:26.583 --> 00:12:28.643
And we actually help them
to take the food,

00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:31.143
they would buy grain somewhere
and ship it across,

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:32.809
and lose some of it along the way,

00:12:32.833 --> 00:12:34.726
we put the dollar value on a card,

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.226
the card can only be used by the refugee

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.684
in a shop that the World
Food Programme certifies.

00:12:39.708 --> 00:12:41.351
So it cannot be used for anything

00:12:41.375 --> 00:12:44.184
other than what the World
Food Programme wants it used for,

00:12:44.208 --> 00:12:47.559
which is grain and food
and vegetables and fruit and milk.

00:12:47.583 --> 00:12:50.934
And that enables the World Food Programme
to save money on leakage.

00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:53.643
What I'm trying to tell you
is it's not about technology,

00:12:53.667 --> 00:12:57.268
it's about using what you have
and using the technology you do possess

00:12:57.292 --> 00:13:00.768
and applying that in a smart,
commercially sustainable way

00:13:00.792 --> 00:13:02.309
to real world problems.

00:13:02.333 --> 00:13:04.226
If you have good technology as well,

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.726
well let's do it even better.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:08.667
But let's not use technology
as the excuse to not do it.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.143
WPR: OK. It makes a lot of sense now.

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:15.143
It seems like underlying all of this

00:13:15.167 --> 00:13:20.143
is this move towards a cashless society.

00:13:20.167 --> 00:13:25.226
This move to sort of create
this way for people to exchange money

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.434
without the need for cash.

00:13:27.458 --> 00:13:29.726
I'm curious to hear from you a little bit

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.934
about what does that actually look like,

00:13:31.958 --> 00:13:34.018
you know, a society without cash.

00:13:34.042 --> 00:13:36.476
What are some of the challenges
that is presents?

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:41.143
AB: Yeah, I think cashless, actually,
is something we are not going to get to,

00:13:41.167 --> 00:13:42.726
and we probably shouldn't.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:44.893
Because just as we have a digital divide,

00:13:44.917 --> 00:13:47.601
do you really want a world
where people who rely on cash

00:13:47.625 --> 00:13:49.309
because it makes them comfortable,

00:13:49.333 --> 00:13:51.601
I'm not talking
about illegal transactions,

00:13:51.625 --> 00:13:54.893
I'm talking about somebody
who just wants to deal in cash,

00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:58.309
they may be older and uncomfortable
with today's technology.

00:13:58.333 --> 00:14:00.018
My dad, when he was alive,

00:14:00.042 --> 00:14:03.768
you know, he never wanted to use a card.

00:14:03.792 --> 00:14:06.309
He always wanted to use a cash and check.

00:14:06.333 --> 00:14:08.934
And this is my father,
when I worked in banking

00:14:08.958 --> 00:14:11.059
and was by then the CEO of Mastercard,

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:13.434
and he would look at me
very indulgently and say,

00:14:13.458 --> 00:14:15.601
"Son, now I have a Mastercard
because of you,

00:14:15.625 --> 00:14:17.684
but could you please go away"
kind of thing.

00:14:17.708 --> 00:14:18.976
And I understand that.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.768
And I think you've got to deal
with therefore "cashless,"

00:14:22.792 --> 00:14:24.101
in inverted commas.

00:14:24.125 --> 00:14:26.643
Reducing cash in the economy

00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:28.768
is to me a good objective.

00:14:28.792 --> 00:14:30.309
Taking it to zero?

00:14:30.333 --> 00:14:31.809
I'm not there.

00:14:31.833 --> 00:14:34.601
Why do I say it's a good
objective to reduce it?

00:14:34.625 --> 00:14:38.893
Because cash actually is the friend

00:14:38.917 --> 00:14:42.559
of the person who has something to hide.

00:14:42.583 --> 00:14:45.559
If you want to not pay your full taxes,

00:14:45.583 --> 00:14:48.018
or you want to do something with the cash

00:14:48.042 --> 00:14:49.393
which is not quite kosher,

00:14:49.417 --> 00:14:51.542
well guess what, here's your chance.

00:14:52.583 --> 00:14:54.976
But if you're electronic,
you are transparent.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.684
Electronic forms of money

00:14:56.708 --> 00:14:59.018
benefits and transfers in utilization,

00:14:59.042 --> 00:15:01.292
create transparency in an economy.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.143
Poorer people,

00:15:04.167 --> 00:15:06.726
they don't have access to cash,

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.309
and therefore, they don't
indulge any of this.

00:15:09.333 --> 00:15:11.976
But even other than that,
even other than all this,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.184
there is a cost of cash in society

00:15:14.208 --> 00:15:17.101
which many people have computed,
central banks, universities,

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:19.726
somewhere between one to two
percent of GDP

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.601
is the cost of printing, securing,

00:15:21.625 --> 00:15:23.976
distributing and using that cash.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.268
One to two percent of GDP.

00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:28.934
I'm certain there are efficient
uses of that GDP

00:15:28.958 --> 00:15:30.559
that we could put into play

00:15:30.583 --> 00:15:33.934
by reducing the role of cash
relatively in the economy.

00:15:33.958 --> 00:15:36.268
In the process,
you take out these middlemen

00:15:36.292 --> 00:15:37.768
who are in positions of power

00:15:37.792 --> 00:15:39.643
when social benefits are distributed,

00:15:39.667 --> 00:15:40.934
when refugees are met.

00:15:40.958 --> 00:15:42.434
That's what I'm talking about.

00:15:42.458 --> 00:15:43.851
That to me is a good thing.

00:15:43.875 --> 00:15:46.476
Transparent, better tax realizations,

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.434
lower money laundering,

00:15:48.458 --> 00:15:49.976
that kind of stuff I'm all for,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.059
and I've been talking
about that for years.

00:15:52.083 --> 00:15:54.500
But zero cash, I'm not there.

00:15:55.417 --> 00:15:58.351
WPR: And do you think there is a point
where you do get there,

00:15:58.375 --> 00:15:59.893
or we get there as a society,

00:15:59.917 --> 00:16:01.601
where that does feel possible?

00:16:01.625 --> 00:16:02.893
AB: We could.

00:16:02.917 --> 00:16:06.101
I mean, if you took countries
in the Nordics, take Sweden.

00:16:06.125 --> 00:16:07.684
Sweden, South Korea,

00:16:07.708 --> 00:16:11.268
these are at the cutting edge
of having reduced cash in their economies.

00:16:11.292 --> 00:16:15.726
In Sweden, essentially everybody uses
electronic forms of payments,

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:19.559
either a card or app on their phone
that they can swish through

00:16:19.583 --> 00:16:21.726
or things of that nature,

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:23.559
consumer payments I'm talking about.

00:16:23.583 --> 00:16:25.976
Even public toilets
on the street in Sweden

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.226
you can pay by on your phone
entering a code,

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:31.518
which comes back to you,

00:16:31.542 --> 00:16:33.684
having deducted that money
from your account.

00:16:33.708 --> 00:16:35.226
You enter the code on a pin pad

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:36.601
and I call that tap and go,

00:16:36.625 --> 00:16:38.768
you go into the public toilet
with that tap.

00:16:38.792 --> 00:16:41.768
That's how far it's advanced in Sweden.

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:43.643
So cash is very low there.

00:16:43.667 --> 00:16:48.184
But even they are having a regular,
continuous public conversation

00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:51.643
about not disadvantaging
those parts of Sweden

00:16:51.667 --> 00:16:53.144
who still want to deal in cash.

00:16:53.168 --> 00:16:54.518
You've got to be careful,

00:16:54.542 --> 00:16:58.643
because remember how does cash reach
distributed points in a country?

00:16:58.667 --> 00:17:00.018
Through banks, through ATMs.

00:17:00.042 --> 00:17:02.768
If those become unprofitable to run

00:17:02.792 --> 00:17:04.726
and people start closing the ATMs down,

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.184
that's a problem in itself.

00:17:06.208 --> 00:17:10.018
So you have to enable
cash back in retailers in some way,

00:17:10.042 --> 00:17:13.185
so that you could still go and get cash
from a distribution system.

00:17:13.209 --> 00:17:14.976
Maybe not an ATM, but a retailer.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.101
There are some ways to do this well,

00:17:17.125 --> 00:17:18.893
but you've got to be conscious of it.

00:17:18.917 --> 00:17:20.684
You know, we haven't reached it yet,

00:17:20.708 --> 00:17:21.976
but we could.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.851
We haven't reached it yet.

00:17:23.875 --> 00:17:26.393
WPR: Of course, when you think about this,

00:17:26.417 --> 00:17:29.434
about moving to a cashless society

00:17:29.458 --> 00:17:31.268
or at least having that as the goal,

00:17:31.292 --> 00:17:35.518
that creates this concern
around data and privacy

00:17:35.542 --> 00:17:37.059
and you've said in the past

00:17:37.083 --> 00:17:41.351
that there's really an importance
behind putting consumers in control

00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:44.226
of their own data and their own privacy.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:46.893
How is that something
that we can actually achieve,

00:17:46.917 --> 00:17:49.851
what does it look like to do that?

00:17:49.875 --> 00:17:51.685
AB: Whitney, it's a terrific question.

00:17:51.709 --> 00:17:53.643
I actually believe that it's at the core

00:17:53.667 --> 00:17:57.643
of a lot to do with the next
10, 20 years of technology,

00:17:57.667 --> 00:18:00.809
the internet of things, 5G, data,

00:18:00.833 --> 00:18:03.893
this is all coming together
at warp speed, right?

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:07.309
If you think about the number of devices
that are going to be connected

00:18:07.333 --> 00:18:10.393
over the next five, ten years,
and what 5G could do

00:18:10.417 --> 00:18:13.559
to moving intelligent computing
to the edge right near you,

00:18:13.583 --> 00:18:16.184
this is going to generate
enormous amounts of data.

00:18:16.208 --> 00:18:17.732
From your fridge, from your car,

00:18:17.756 --> 00:18:20.268
from you walking around,
from your connected glasses,

00:18:20.292 --> 00:18:22.476
from your watch already, all that.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.226
From your shoes if you're a runner.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:28.518
So you've got to get to a stage
where we take a responsibility

00:18:28.542 --> 00:18:32.226
of how your data is used and interpreted.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.976
And so, Mastercard,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.434
we with a bunch of companies,

00:18:35.458 --> 00:18:38.726
we have laid out a set of data principles.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.893
The first one is exactly what you said.

00:18:40.917 --> 00:18:43.434
It's your data, you should control it.

00:18:43.458 --> 00:18:46.309
Meaning you should know
what's being collected,

00:18:46.333 --> 00:18:49.309
you should be able to say,
"I don't want that to be collected,"

00:18:49.333 --> 00:18:50.726
in simple language,

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:55.268
not in a 12-page legal agreement
that you cannot comprehend.

00:18:55.292 --> 00:19:00.101
And you should be able to benefit
from that data of yours that is used,

00:19:00.125 --> 00:19:03.934
either directly, or indirectly
in some way that you comprehend.

00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:07.184
And if I as a company
am collecting your data

00:19:07.208 --> 00:19:09.268
to enable me to do business with you,

00:19:09.292 --> 00:19:12.268
I should collect the minimum amount I need

00:19:12.292 --> 00:19:13.893
to do my job with you

00:19:13.917 --> 00:19:16.934
and I should keep
whatever I collect safe for you,

00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:20.226
and allow it to be deducted
or removed when you want it.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.822
These are not complicated things.

00:19:21.846 --> 00:19:23.684
Your data, you're in control,

00:19:23.708 --> 00:19:25.851
you should be able
to delete it when you want,

00:19:25.875 --> 00:19:27.768
you should know what's being collected.

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:30.684
If I do anything with you,
collect the minimum, keep it safe.

00:19:30.708 --> 00:19:33.059
Consumers will vote
with their feet on this topic.

00:19:33.083 --> 00:19:34.643
As they get more knowledgeable,

00:19:34.667 --> 00:19:36.143
as they get more educated,

00:19:36.167 --> 00:19:37.768
and that's the right thing to do,

00:19:37.792 --> 00:19:41.643
they need to say, "I don't want you
to use my data for the following things.

00:19:41.667 --> 00:19:43.643
I want to know what it's being used for."

00:19:43.667 --> 00:19:45.893
Putting consumer back
in control of their data

00:19:45.917 --> 00:19:49.643
is going to be mission critical
in the data-driven economy

00:19:49.667 --> 00:19:51.309
of the next 10, 20 years.

00:19:51.333 --> 00:19:54.184
WPR: Thank you so much, Ajay,
this was a great conversation

00:19:54.208 --> 00:19:56.226
and we appreciate you being with us today.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:57.851
AB: Thanks a lot, see you again.

00:19:57.875 --> 00:19:59.292
Good luck.
