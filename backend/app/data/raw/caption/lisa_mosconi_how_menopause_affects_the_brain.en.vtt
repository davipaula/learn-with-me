00:00:13.292 --> 00:00:15.809
Women are works of art.

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:18.393
On the outside as on the inside.

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:21.809
I am a neuroscientist,
and I focus on the inside,

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:24.393
especially on women's brains.

00:00:24.417 --> 00:00:27.268
There are many theories
on how women's brains differ

00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:28.559
from men's brains,

00:00:28.583 --> 00:00:30.684
and I've been looking
at brains for 20 years

00:00:30.708 --> 00:00:33.684
and can guarantee
that there is no such thing

00:00:33.708 --> 00:00:35.768
as a gendered brain.

00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:38.101
Pink and blue, Barbie and Lego,

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:40.809
those are all inventions
that have nothing to do

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:43.083
with the way our brains are built.

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:47.226
That said, women's brains
differ from men's brains

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.643
in some respects.

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:50.893
And I'm here to talk
about these differences,

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:54.226
because they actually matter
for our health.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.518
For example,

00:00:55.542 --> 00:00:59.309
women are more likely than men
to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.726
or depression,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.476
not to mention headaches and migraines.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.976
But also, at the core of my research,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.726
women are more likely than men
to have Alzheimer's disease.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.018
Alzheimer's disease
is the most common cause

00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:14.184
of dementia on the planet,

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:19.768
affecting close to six million people
in the United States alone.

00:01:19.792 --> 00:01:23.309
But almost two thirds of all those people

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.226
are actually women.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.018
So for every man
suffering from Alzheimer's

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:29.643
there are two women.

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:32.643
So why is that overall?

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:34.018
Is it age?

00:01:34.042 --> 00:01:35.434
Is it lifespan?

00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:37.601
What else could it be?

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:38.976
A few years ago,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.934
I launched the Women's Brain Initiative

00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.226
at Weill Cornell Medicine
in New York City,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.601
exactly to answer those questions.

00:01:45.625 --> 00:01:48.667
And tonight, I'm here with some answers.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.476
So it turns out
our brains age differently,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.208
and menopause plays
a key role here for women.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.476
Now most people think of the brain
as a kind of black box,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.476
isolated from the rest of the body.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.601
But in reality, our brains
are in constant interaction

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:08.893
with the rest of us.

00:02:08.917 --> 00:02:10.393
And perhaps surprisingly,

00:02:10.417 --> 00:02:14.018
the interactions
with the reproductive system

00:02:14.042 --> 00:02:17.851
are crucial for brain aging in women.

00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:20.643
These interactions
are mediated by our hormones.

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:24.643
And we know that hormones differ
between the genders.

00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:28.226
Men have more testosterone,
women have more estrogens.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.684
But what really matters here

00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:33.393
is that these hormones differ
in their longevity.

00:02:33.417 --> 00:02:36.601
Men's testosterone doesn't run out
until late in life,

00:02:36.625 --> 00:02:41.476
which is a slow and pretty much
symptom-free process, of course.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.018
(Laughter)

00:02:45.042 --> 00:02:47.434
Women's estrogens, on the other hand,

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:50.434
start fading in midlife, during menopause,

00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:54.059
which is anything but symptom-free.

00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:57.018
We associate menopause with the ovaries,

00:02:57.042 --> 00:02:59.851
but when women say
that they're having hot flashes,

00:02:59.875 --> 00:03:03.809
night sweats, insomnia,
memory lapses, depression, anxiety,

00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:06.184
those symptoms don't start in the ovaries.

00:03:06.208 --> 00:03:08.768
They start in the brain.

00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:10.893
Those are neurological symptoms.

00:03:10.917 --> 00:03:14.309
We're just not used
to thinking about them as such.

00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:15.643
So why is that?

00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:19.393
Why are our brains impacted by menopause?

00:03:19.417 --> 00:03:20.684
Well, first of all,

00:03:20.708 --> 00:03:24.809
our brains and ovaries are part
of the neuroendocrine system.

00:03:24.833 --> 00:03:27.351
As part of the system,
the brain talks to the ovaries

00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:29.233
and the ovaries talk back to the brain,

00:03:29.257 --> 00:03:32.351
every day of our lives as women.

00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:36.268
So the health of the ovaries
is linked to the health of the brain.

00:03:36.292 --> 00:03:38.309
And the other way around.

00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:39.643
At the same time,

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:43.309
hormones like estrogen
are not only involved in reproduction,

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:45.976
but also in brain function.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.559
And estrogen in particular, or estradiol,

00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:52.726
is really key for energy
production in the brain.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.309
At the cellular level,

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:58.309
estrogen literally pushes neurons
to burn glucose to make energy.

00:03:58.333 --> 00:03:59.768
If your estrogen is high,

00:03:59.792 --> 00:04:01.893
your brain energy is high.

00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:04.184
When your estrogen declines though,

00:04:04.208 --> 00:04:08.101
your neurons start slowing down
and age faster.

00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:10.184
And studies have shown that this process

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:13.601
can even lead to the formation
of amyloid plaques,

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:15.184
or Alzheimer's plaques,

00:04:15.208 --> 00:04:18.309
which are a hallmark
of Alzheimer's disease.

00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:21.143
These effects are stronger
in specific brain regions,

00:04:21.167 --> 00:04:23.059
starting with the hypothalamus,

00:04:23.083 --> 00:04:26.184
which is in charge of regulating
body temperature.

00:04:26.208 --> 00:04:29.268
When estrogen doesn't activate
the hypothalamus correctly,

00:04:29.292 --> 00:04:33.018
the brain cannot regulate
body temperature correctly.

00:04:33.042 --> 00:04:35.434
So those hot flashes that women get,

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:37.559
that's the hypothalamus.

00:04:37.583 --> 00:04:40.934
Then there's the brain stem,
in charge of sleep and wake.

00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.643
When estrogen doesn't activate
the brain stem correctly,

00:04:43.667 --> 00:04:45.601
we have trouble sleeping.

00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:46.934
Or it's the amygdala,

00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:50.226
the emotional center of the brain,
close to the hippocampus,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.268
the memory center of the brain.

00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:55.143
When estrogen levels ebb in these regions,

00:04:55.167 --> 00:04:57.226
we start getting mood swings perhaps

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.518
and forget things.

00:04:58.542 --> 00:05:02.976
So this is the brain anatomy
of menopause, if you will.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.268
But let me show you

00:05:04.292 --> 00:05:07.226
what an actual
woman's brain can look like.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.976
So this is a kind of brain scan

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.726
called positron emission
tomography or PET.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.851
It looks at brain energy levels.

00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:17.518
And this is what you want
your brain to look like

00:05:17.542 --> 00:05:19.226
when you're in your 40s.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.309
Really nice and bright.

00:05:21.333 --> 00:05:24.393
Now this brain belongs to a woman
who was 43 years old

00:05:24.417 --> 00:05:27.518
when she was first scanned,
before menopause.

00:05:27.542 --> 00:05:32.393
And this is the same brain
just eight years later,

00:05:32.417 --> 00:05:34.684
after menopause.

00:05:34.708 --> 00:05:36.518
If we put them side by side,

00:05:36.542 --> 00:05:38.976
I think you can easily see
how the bright yellow

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.768
turned orange, almost purple.

00:05:41.792 --> 00:05:46.292
That's a 30 percent drop
in brain energy levels.

00:05:47.417 --> 00:05:49.393
Now in general,

00:05:49.417 --> 00:05:54.768
this just doesn't seem to happen
to a man of the same age.

00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:56.976
In our studies with hundreds of people,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.809
we show that middle-aged men
usually have high brain energy levels.

00:06:01.833 --> 00:06:06.018
For women, brain energy
is usually fine before menopause,

00:06:06.042 --> 00:06:09.500
but then it gradually declines
during the transition.

00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:13.768
And this was found independent of age.

00:06:13.792 --> 00:06:16.893
It didn't matter
if the women were 40, 50 or 60.

00:06:16.917 --> 00:06:21.393
What mattered most
was that they were in menopause.

00:06:21.417 --> 00:06:24.101
So of course we need
more research to confirm this,

00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:26.726
but it looks like 
women's brains in midlife

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.393
are more sensitive to hormonal aging

00:06:29.417 --> 00:06:32.018
than just straight up chronological aging.

00:06:32.042 --> 00:06:34.184
And this is important information to have,

00:06:34.208 --> 00:06:37.518
because so many women
can feel these changes.

00:06:37.542 --> 00:06:39.518
So many of our patients have said to me

00:06:39.542 --> 00:06:42.518
that they feel like their minds
are playing tricks on them,

00:06:42.542 --> 00:06:44.184
to put it mildly.

00:06:44.208 --> 00:06:47.393
So I really want to validate this,
because it's real.

00:06:47.417 --> 00:06:50.809
And so just to clarify, if this is you,

00:06:50.833 --> 00:06:53.101
you are not crazy.

00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:54.851
(Laughter)

00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:56.643
(Applause)

00:06:56.667 --> 00:06:57.917
Thank you.

00:06:58.708 --> 00:06:59.976
It's important.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.059
So many women have worried
that they might be losing their minds.

00:07:03.083 --> 00:07:06.643
But the truth is that your brain
might be going through a transition,

00:07:06.667 --> 00:07:08.191
or is going through a transition

00:07:08.215 --> 00:07:11.309
and needs time and support to adjust.

00:07:11.333 --> 00:07:12.893
Also, if anyone is concerned

00:07:12.917 --> 00:07:16.018
that middle-aged women
might be underperformers,

00:07:16.042 --> 00:07:19.143
I'll just quickly add
that we looked at cognitive performance,

00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:20.476
God forbid, right?

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.934
(Laughter)

00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:23.684
Let's not do that.

00:07:23.708 --> 00:07:25.601
But we looked at cognitive performance,

00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:29.059
and we found absolutely no differences
between men and women

00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:31.684
before and after menopause.

00:07:31.708 --> 00:07:33.934
And other studies confirm this.

00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.768
So basically, we may be tired,

00:07:36.792 --> 00:07:38.934
but we are just as sharp.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.351
(Laughter)

00:07:41.375 --> 00:07:43.393
Get that out of the way.

00:07:43.417 --> 00:07:44.684
That all said,

00:07:44.708 --> 00:07:47.768
there is something else more serious
that deserves our attention.

00:07:47.792 --> 00:07:49.059
If you remember,

00:07:49.083 --> 00:07:51.934
I mentioned that estrogen declines
could potentially promote

00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:54.809
the formation of amyloid plaques,
or Alzheimer's plaques.

00:07:54.833 --> 00:07:58.434
But there's another kind of brain scan
that looks exactly at those plaques.

00:07:58.458 --> 00:08:02.309
And we used it to show
that middle-aged men hardly have any,

00:08:02.333 --> 00:08:03.601
which is great.

00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:05.059
But for women,

00:08:05.083 --> 00:08:10.268
there's quite a bit of an increase
during the transition to menopause.

00:08:10.292 --> 00:08:12.351
And I want to be really, really clear here

00:08:12.375 --> 00:08:14.768
that not all women develop the plaques,

00:08:14.792 --> 00:08:18.018
and not all women with the plaques
develop dementia.

00:08:18.042 --> 00:08:20.059
Having the plaques is a risk factor,

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:24.476
it is not in any way a diagnosis,
especially at this stage.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.768
But still, it's quite an insight

00:08:26.792 --> 00:08:29.434
to associate Alzheimer's with menopause.

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:31.976
We think of menopause
as belonging to middle age

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.518
and Alzheimer's as belonging to old age.

00:08:34.542 --> 00:08:35.809
But in reality,

00:08:35.833 --> 00:08:37.851
many studies, including my own work,

00:08:37.875 --> 00:08:42.101
had shown that Alzheimer's disease
starts with negative changes in the brain

00:08:42.125 --> 00:08:46.684
years, if not decades,
prior to clinical symptoms.

00:08:46.708 --> 00:08:48.018
So for women,

00:08:48.042 --> 00:08:50.976
it looks like this process
starts in midlife,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.393
during menopause.

00:08:52.417 --> 00:08:54.309
Which is important information to have,

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:58.559
because it gives us a time line
to start looking for those changes.

00:08:58.583 --> 00:09:00.726
So in terms of a time line,

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.101
most women go through menopause
in their early 50s.

00:09:04.125 --> 00:09:05.893
But it can be earlier,

00:09:05.917 --> 00:09:08.809
often because of medical interventions.

00:09:08.833 --> 00:09:12.726
And the common example is a hysterectomy
and/or an oophorectomy,

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.393
which is the surgical
removal of the uterus

00:09:15.417 --> 00:09:17.351
and/or the ovaries.

00:09:17.375 --> 00:09:19.851
And unfortunately, there is evidence

00:09:19.875 --> 00:09:23.059
that having the uterus
and, more so, the ovaries removed

00:09:23.083 --> 00:09:24.809
prior to menopause

00:09:24.833 --> 00:09:29.434
correlates with the higher risk
of dementia in women.

00:09:29.458 --> 00:09:31.559
And I know that this is upsetting news,

00:09:31.583 --> 00:09:33.684
and it's definitely depressing news,

00:09:33.708 --> 00:09:35.351
but we need to talk about it

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:38.893
because most women
are not aware of this correlation,

00:09:38.917 --> 00:09:42.101
and it seems like very important
information to have.

00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:45.184
Also, no one is suggesting
that women decline these procedures

00:09:45.208 --> 00:09:46.893
if they need them.

00:09:46.917 --> 00:09:50.601
The point here is that we really need
to better understand

00:09:50.625 --> 00:09:54.018
what happens to our brains
as we go through menopause,

00:09:54.042 --> 00:09:55.726
natural or medical,

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:59.184
and how to protect
our brains in the process.

00:09:59.208 --> 00:10:00.559
So how do we do that?

00:10:00.583 --> 00:10:02.018
How do we protect our brains?

00:10:02.042 --> 00:10:03.893
Should we take hormones?

00:10:03.917 --> 00:10:06.559
That's a fair question,
it's a good question.

00:10:06.583 --> 00:10:09.184
And the shortest possible answer right now

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:11.684
is that hormonal therapy can be helpful

00:10:11.708 --> 00:10:14.976
to alleviate a number of symptoms,
like hot flashes,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.768
but it's not currently recommended
for dementia prevention.

00:10:18.792 --> 00:10:22.184
And many of us are working
on testing different formulations

00:10:22.208 --> 00:10:24.768
and different dosages
and different time lines,

00:10:24.792 --> 00:10:28.851
and hopefully, all this work will lead
to a change in recommendations

00:10:28.875 --> 00:10:30.768
in the future.

00:10:30.792 --> 00:10:34.143
Meanwhile, there are other things
that we can do today

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:36.893
to support our hormones
and their effects on the brain

00:10:36.917 --> 00:10:38.976
that do not require medications

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.934
but do require taking a good look
at our lifestyle.

00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.226
That's because the foods we eat,

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:46.934
how much exercise we get,

00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:49.101
how much sleep we get or don't get,

00:10:49.125 --> 00:10:51.101
how much stress we have in our lives,

00:10:51.125 --> 00:10:54.309
those are all things that can actually
impact our hormones --

00:10:54.333 --> 00:10:56.684
for better and for worse.

00:10:56.708 --> 00:10:58.684
Food, for example.

00:10:58.708 --> 00:11:00.601
There are many diets out there,

00:11:00.625 --> 00:11:04.434
but studies have shown
that the Mediterranean diet in particular

00:11:04.458 --> 00:11:07.643
is supportive of women's health.

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:11.101
Women on this diet have a much lower risk

00:11:11.125 --> 00:11:13.643
of cognitive decline, of depression,

00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:16.684
of heart disease,
of stroke and of cancer,

00:11:16.708 --> 00:11:19.518
and they also have fewer hot flashes.

00:11:19.542 --> 00:11:21.851
What's interesting about this diet

00:11:21.875 --> 00:11:25.976
is that it's quite rich in foods
that contain estrogens

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.643
in the form of phytoestrogens
or estrogens from plants

00:11:29.667 --> 00:11:32.643
that act like mild estrogens
in our bodies.

00:11:32.667 --> 00:11:36.143
Some phytoestrogens have been linked
to a possible risk of cancer,

00:11:36.167 --> 00:11:39.351
but not the ones in this diet,
which are safe.

00:11:39.375 --> 00:11:41.976
Especially from flax seeds,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.976
sesame seeds, dried apricots,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.559
legumes and a number of fruits.

00:11:47.583 --> 00:11:49.476
And for some good news,

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.643
dark chocolate
contains phytoestrogens, too.

00:11:53.667 --> 00:11:56.059
So diet is one way to gain estrogens,

00:11:56.083 --> 00:12:00.351
but it's just as important to avoid things
that suppress our estrogens instead,

00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:02.309
especially stress.

00:12:02.333 --> 00:12:05.309
Stress can literally steal your estrogens,

00:12:05.333 --> 00:12:08.809
and that's because cortisol,
which is the main stress hormone,

00:12:08.833 --> 00:12:11.434
works in balance with our estrogens.

00:12:11.458 --> 00:12:14.143
So if cortisol goes up,
your estrogens go down.

00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:17.059
If cortisol goes down,
your estrogens go back up.

00:12:17.083 --> 00:12:19.351
So reducing stress is really important.

00:12:19.375 --> 00:12:21.643
It doesn't just help your day,

00:12:21.667 --> 00:12:24.393
it also helps your brain.

00:12:24.417 --> 00:12:25.934
So these are just a few things

00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:27.684
that we can do to support our brains

00:12:27.708 --> 00:12:28.976
and there are more.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.393
But the important thing here

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:33.976
is that changing the way
we understand the female brain

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.143
really changes the way
that we care for it,

00:12:37.167 --> 00:12:39.934
and the way that we frame women's health.

00:12:39.958 --> 00:12:42.893
And the more women
demand this information,

00:12:42.917 --> 00:12:46.309
the sooner we'll be able to break
the taboos around menopause,

00:12:46.333 --> 00:12:49.226
and also come up with solutions
that actually work,

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:50.851
not just for Alzheimer's disease,

00:12:50.875 --> 00:12:53.559
but for women's brain health as a whole.

00:12:53.583 --> 00:12:56.268
Brain health is women's health.

00:12:56.292 --> 00:12:57.559
Thank you.

00:12:57.583 --> 00:12:59.518
(Applause)

00:12:59.542 --> 00:13:00.809
Thank you.

00:13:00.833 --> 00:13:02.083
Oh, thank you.
