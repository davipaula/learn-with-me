00:00:12.984 --> 00:00:15.207
So one of the most important solutions

00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:18.507
to the global challenge
posed by climate change

00:00:18.531 --> 00:00:21.961
lies right under our foot every day.

00:00:22.478 --> 00:00:23.628
It's soil.

00:00:24.385 --> 00:00:29.186
Soil's just the thin veil
that covers the surface of land,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.214
but it has the power to shape
our planet's destiny.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.759
See, a six-foot or so of soil,

00:00:37.783 --> 00:00:41.247
loose soil material
that covers the earth's surface,

00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:46.080
represents the difference between life
and lifelessness in the earth system,

00:00:47.493 --> 00:00:50.724
and it can also help us
combat climate change

00:00:50.748 --> 00:00:54.057
if we can only stop treating it like dirt.

00:00:54.851 --> 00:00:56.213
(Laughter)

00:00:56.237 --> 00:00:58.212
Climate change is happening,

00:00:58.236 --> 00:01:00.732
the earth's atmosphere is warming,

00:01:00.756 --> 00:01:03.868
because of the increasing amount
of greenhouse gases

00:01:03.892 --> 00:01:06.185
we keep releasing into the atmosphere.

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:07.677
You all know that.

00:01:08.373 --> 00:01:10.694
But what I assume you might not have heard

00:01:10.718 --> 00:01:15.866
is that one of the most important things
our human society could do

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.592
to address climate change

00:01:17.616 --> 00:01:19.598
lies right there in the soil.

00:01:21.846 --> 00:01:26.081
I'm a soil scientist who has been
studying soil since I was 18,

00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:29.806
because I'm interested in unlocking
the secrets of soil

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.711
and helping people understand this
really important climate change solution.

00:01:35.782 --> 00:01:38.027
So here are the facts about climate.

00:01:38.051 --> 00:01:41.731
The concentration of carbon dioxide
in the earth's atmosphere

00:01:41.755 --> 00:01:44.132
has increased by 40 percent

00:01:44.156 --> 00:01:46.926
just in the last 150 years or so.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.870
Human actions are now releasing
9.4 billion metric tons of carbon

00:01:52.894 --> 00:01:54.672
into the atmosphere,

00:01:54.696 --> 00:01:58.020
from activities
such as burning fossil fuels

00:01:58.044 --> 00:02:01.021
and intensive agricultural practices,

00:02:01.045 --> 00:02:03.878
and other ways we change
the way we use land,

00:02:03.902 --> 00:02:05.591
including deforestation.

00:02:07.254 --> 00:02:12.636
But the concentration of carbon dioxide
that stays in the atmosphere

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.143
is only increasing by about half of that,

00:02:16.314 --> 00:02:20.450
and that's because half of the carbon
we keep releasing into the atmosphere

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:24.178
is currently being taken up
by land and the seas

00:02:24.202 --> 00:02:26.854
through a process we know
as carbon sequestration.

00:02:27.752 --> 00:02:32.412
So in essence, whatever consequence
you think we're facing

00:02:32.436 --> 00:02:34.704
from climate change right now,

00:02:34.728 --> 00:02:40.084
we're only experiencing the consequence
of 50 percent of our pollution,

00:02:41.148 --> 00:02:44.386
because the natural ecosystems
are bailing us out.

00:02:45.495 --> 00:02:47.074
But don't get too comfortable,

00:02:47.995 --> 00:02:51.630
because we have two major things
working against us right now.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.671
One: unless we do something big,

00:02:57.695 --> 00:02:59.614
and then fast,

00:02:59.638 --> 00:03:01.472
emissions will continue to rise.

00:03:02.511 --> 00:03:07.558
And second: the ability
of these natural ecosystems

00:03:07.582 --> 00:03:10.510
to take up carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere

00:03:10.534 --> 00:03:13.940
and sequester it in the natural habitats

00:03:13.964 --> 00:03:15.877
is currently getting compromised,

00:03:15.901 --> 00:03:20.646
as they're experiencing serious
degradation because of human actions.

00:03:21.616 --> 00:03:23.735
So it's not entirely clear

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:27.703
that we will continue to get bailed out
by these natural ecosystems

00:03:27.727 --> 00:03:31.505
if we continue on this
business-as-usual path that we've been.

00:03:33.107 --> 00:03:34.997
Here's where the soil comes in:

00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:39.504
there is about three thousand billion
metric tons of carbon in the soil.

00:03:40.281 --> 00:03:43.952
That's roughly about 315 times
the amount of carbon

00:03:43.976 --> 00:03:46.677
that we release
into the atmosphere currently.

00:03:46.701 --> 00:03:50.963
And there's twice more carbon in soil
than there is in vegetation and air.

00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:54.362
Think about that for a second.

00:03:54.386 --> 00:03:56.647
There's more carbon in soil

00:03:56.671 --> 00:04:00.455
than there is in all
of the world's vegetation,

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:05.891
including the lush tropical rainforests
and the giant sequoias,

00:04:05.915 --> 00:04:08.201
the expansive grasslands,

00:04:08.225 --> 00:04:10.978
all of the cultivated systems,

00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:14.628
and every kind of flora you can imagine
on the face of the earth,

00:04:15.703 --> 00:04:20.883
plus all the carbon that's currently
up in the atmosphere, combined,

00:04:20.907 --> 00:04:22.383
and then twice over.

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:28.799
Hence, a very small change
in the amount of carbon stored in soil

00:04:28.823 --> 00:04:32.864
can make a big difference
in maintenance of the earth's atmosphere.

00:04:34.597 --> 00:04:38.572
But soil's not just simply
a storage box for carbon, though.

00:04:38.596 --> 00:04:41.554
It operates more like a bank account,

00:04:41.578 --> 00:04:44.627
and the amount of carbon
that's in soil at any given time

00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:48.395
is a function of the amount of carbon
coming in and out of the soil.

00:04:49.516 --> 00:04:53.246
Carbon comes into the soil
through the process of photosynthesis,

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.445
when green plants take carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:59.229
and use it to make their bodies,

00:04:59.253 --> 00:05:01.872
and upon death,
their bodies enter the soil.

00:05:02.753 --> 00:05:04.532
And carbon leaves the soil

00:05:04.556 --> 00:05:07.464
and goes right back up into the atmosphere

00:05:07.488 --> 00:05:10.258
when the bodies of those
formerly living organisms

00:05:10.282 --> 00:05:13.099
decay in soil by the activity of microbes.

00:05:14.057 --> 00:05:18.105
See, decomposition releases
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:22.611
as well as other greenhouse gases
such as methane and nitrous oxide,

00:05:22.635 --> 00:05:27.103
but it also releases all the nutrients
we all need to survive.

00:05:28.359 --> 00:05:32.765
One of the things that makes soil
such a fundamental component

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:35.677
of any climate change mitigation strategy

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:39.447
is because it represents
a long-term storage of carbon.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.038
Carbon that would have lasted
maybe a year or two

00:05:43.062 --> 00:05:46.941
in decaying residue
if it was left on the surface

00:05:46.965 --> 00:05:51.584
can stay in soil for hundreds of years,
even thousands and more.

00:05:52.568 --> 00:05:55.213
Soil biogeochemists like me

00:05:55.237 --> 00:05:59.949
study exactly how the soil system
makes this possible,

00:05:59.973 --> 00:06:04.840
by locking away the carbon
in physical association with minerals,

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:07.777
inside aggregates of soil minerals,

00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:11.319
and formation of strong chemical bonds

00:06:11.343 --> 00:06:14.668
that bind the carbon
to the surfaces of the minerals.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.531
See when carbon is entrapped in soil,

00:06:18.555 --> 00:06:21.797
in these kinds of associations
with soil minerals,

00:06:21.821 --> 00:06:25.837
even the wiliest of the microbes
can't easily degrade it.

00:06:25.861 --> 00:06:28.409
And carbon that's not degrading fast

00:06:28.433 --> 00:06:32.670
is carbon that's not going back
into the atmosphere as greenhouse gases.

00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:35.760
But the benefit of carbon sequestration

00:06:35.784 --> 00:06:38.982
is not just limited
to climate change mitigation.

00:06:39.006 --> 00:06:45.675
Soil that stores large amounts of carbon
is healthy, fertile, soft.

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:48.405
It's malleable. It's workable.

00:06:48.977 --> 00:06:51.460
It makes it like a sponge.

00:06:51.484 --> 00:06:54.230
It can hold on to
a lot of water and nutrients.

00:06:55.112 --> 00:06:57.676
Healthy and fertile soils like this

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.747
support the most dynamic, abundant
and diverse habitat for living things

00:07:02.771 --> 00:07:05.557
that we know of anywhere
on the earth system.

00:07:07.483 --> 00:07:13.630
It makes life possible for everything
from the tiniest of the microbes,

00:07:13.654 --> 00:07:15.904
such as bacteria and fungi,

00:07:15.928 --> 00:07:18.127
all the way to higher plants,

00:07:18.151 --> 00:07:23.198
and fulfills the food, feed
and fiber needs for all animals,

00:07:23.222 --> 00:07:24.681
including you and I.

00:07:25.915 --> 00:07:29.789
So at this point, you would assume
that we should be treating soil

00:07:29.813 --> 00:07:31.836
like the precious resource that it is.

00:07:32.198 --> 00:07:34.163
Unfortunately, that's not the case.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:40.501
Soils around the world are experiencing
unprecedented rates of degradation

00:07:40.525 --> 00:07:45.828
through a variety of human actions
that include deforestation,

00:07:45.852 --> 00:07:48.627
intensive agricultural production systems,

00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:49.960
overgrazing,

00:07:49.984 --> 00:07:53.407
excessive application
of agricultural chemicals,

00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:55.484
erosion and similar things.

00:07:57.318 --> 00:08:00.945
Half of the world's soils
are currently considered degraded.

00:08:02.284 --> 00:08:05.943
Soil degradation is bad for many reasons,

00:08:05.967 --> 00:08:07.824
but let me just tell you a couple.

00:08:08.752 --> 00:08:15.130
One: degraded soils have diminished
potential to support plant productivity.

00:08:15.154 --> 00:08:18.012
And hence, by degrading soil,

00:08:18.036 --> 00:08:23.955
we're compromising our own abilities
to provide the food and other resources

00:08:23.979 --> 00:08:25.853
that we need for us

00:08:25.877 --> 00:08:29.923
and every member of living things
on the face of the earth.

00:08:31.478 --> 00:08:32.628
And second:

00:08:34.043 --> 00:08:38.820
soil use and degradation,
just in the last 200 years or so,

00:08:38.844 --> 00:08:43.724
has released 12 times more carbon
into the atmosphere

00:08:43.748 --> 00:08:47.305
compared to the rate at
which we're releasing carbon

00:08:47.329 --> 00:08:49.105
into the atmosphere right now.

00:08:50.028 --> 00:08:52.541
I'm afraid there's even more bad news.

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:55.764
This is a story of soils
at high latitudes.

00:08:56.504 --> 00:08:59.362
Peatlands in polar environments

00:08:59.386 --> 00:09:03.153
store about a third
of the global soil carbon reserves.

00:09:03.177 --> 00:09:06.212
These peatlands have
a permanently frozen ground underneath,

00:09:06.236 --> 00:09:07.724
the permafrost,

00:09:07.748 --> 00:09:13.131
and the carbon was able to build up
in these soils over long periods of time

00:09:13.155 --> 00:09:18.115
because even though plants are able
to photosynthesize during the short,

00:09:18.139 --> 00:09:20.361
warm summer months,

00:09:20.385 --> 00:09:24.147
the environment quickly
turns cold and dark,

00:09:24.171 --> 00:09:27.964
and then microbes are not able
to efficiently break down the residue.

00:09:28.821 --> 00:09:31.806
So the soil carbon bank
in these polar environments

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.885
built up over hundreds
of thousands of years.

00:09:36.001 --> 00:09:39.593
But right now, with atmospheric warming,

00:09:39.617 --> 00:09:42.949
the permafrost is thawing and draining.

00:09:43.845 --> 00:09:46.746
And when permafrost thaws and drains,

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.607
it makes it possible
for microbes to come in

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:52.823
and rather quickly
decompose all this carbon,

00:09:52.847 --> 00:09:57.545
with the potential to release hundreds
of billions of metric tons of carbon

00:09:57.569 --> 00:10:00.347
into the atmosphere
in the form of greenhouse gases.

00:10:01.145 --> 00:10:05.200
And this release of additional
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere

00:10:05.224 --> 00:10:08.175
will only contribute to further warming

00:10:08.199 --> 00:10:11.832
that makes this predicament even worse,

00:10:11.856 --> 00:10:16.986
as it starts a self-reinforcing
positive feedback loop

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.831
that could go on and on and on,

00:10:19.855 --> 00:10:22.497
dramatically changing our climate future.

00:10:23.558 --> 00:10:28.177
Fortunately, I can also tell you
that there is a solution

00:10:28.201 --> 00:10:32.806
for these two wicked problems
of soil degradation and climate change.

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.218
Just like we created these problems,

00:10:35.242 --> 00:10:37.446
we do know the solution,

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:40.344
and the solution lies
in simultaneously working

00:10:40.368 --> 00:10:42.683
to address these two things together,

00:10:43.628 --> 00:10:47.545
through what we call
climate-smart land management practices.

00:10:48.333 --> 00:10:49.738
What do I mean here?

00:10:49.762 --> 00:10:53.019
I mean managing land
in a way that's smart

00:10:53.043 --> 00:10:56.190
about maximizing
how much carbon we store in soil.

00:10:57.521 --> 00:10:59.334
And we can accomplish this

00:10:59.358 --> 00:11:03.748
by putting in place
deep-rooted perennial plants,

00:11:03.772 --> 00:11:06.122
putting back forests whenever possible,

00:11:06.146 --> 00:11:10.605
reducing tillage and other disturbances
from agricultural practices,

00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:15.329
including optimizing the use
of agricultural chemicals and grazing

00:11:15.353 --> 00:11:19.038
and even adding carbon to soil,
whenever possible,

00:11:19.062 --> 00:11:23.333
from recycled resources
such as compost and even human waste.

00:11:24.721 --> 00:11:28.269
This kind of land stewardship
is not a radical idea.

00:11:29.164 --> 00:11:32.656
It's what made it possible
for fertile soils

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.722
to be able to support human civilizations
since time immemorial.

00:11:37.522 --> 00:11:40.100
In fact, some are doing it just right now.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.436
There's a global effort underway
to accomplish exactly this goal.

00:11:46.193 --> 00:11:50.603
This effort that started in France
is known as the "4 per 1000" effort,

00:11:51.557 --> 00:11:55.216
and it sets an aspirational goal

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:01.707
to increase the amount of carbon
stored in soil by 0.4 percent annually,

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:06.846
using the same kind of climate-smart
land management practices

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.020
I mentioned earlier.

00:12:08.748 --> 00:12:11.240
And if this effort's fully successful,

00:12:12.169 --> 00:12:15.560
it can offset a third
of the global emissions

00:12:15.584 --> 00:12:18.366
of fossil-fuel-derived carbon
into the atmosphere.

00:12:19.409 --> 00:12:23.151
But even if this effort
is not fully successful,

00:12:23.175 --> 00:12:26.565
but we just start heading
in that direction,

00:12:26.589 --> 00:12:31.214
we still end up with soils
that are healthier, more fertile,

00:12:31.238 --> 00:12:35.395
are able to produce all the food
and resources that we need

00:12:35.419 --> 00:12:37.730
for human populations and more,

00:12:37.754 --> 00:12:40.180
and also soils that are better capable

00:12:40.204 --> 00:12:43.600
of sequestering carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere

00:12:43.624 --> 00:12:46.378
and helping with
climate change mitigation.

00:12:47.402 --> 00:12:51.148
I'm pretty sure that's what politicians
call a win-win solution.

00:12:51.945 --> 00:12:54.457
And we all can have a role to play here.

00:12:55.622 --> 00:13:01.098
We can start by treating the soil
with the respect that it deserves:

00:13:01.122 --> 00:13:06.424
respect for its ability
as the basis of all life on earth,

00:13:06.448 --> 00:13:10.406
respect for its ability to serve
as a carbon bank

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:14.511
and respect for its ability
to control our climate.

00:13:15.591 --> 00:13:17.171
And if we do so,

00:13:17.195 --> 00:13:19.649
we can then simultaneously address

00:13:19.673 --> 00:13:24.036
two of the most pressing
global challenges of our time:

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.696
climate change and soil degradation.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:32.903
And in the process, we would be able
to provide food and nutritional security

00:13:32.927 --> 00:13:34.783
to our growing human family.

00:13:35.441 --> 00:13:36.592
Thank you.

00:13:36.616 --> 00:13:41.238
