00:00:10.792 --> 00:00:13.792
You probably don't realize

00:00:13.806 --> 00:00:16.837
that right now, you're actually
looking at something quite rare.

00:00:16.838 --> 00:00:22.148
Because I am a millennial
computer scientist book author

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:24.027
standing on a TEDx stage,

00:00:24.028 --> 00:00:26.579
and yet, I've never had
a social media account.

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.147
How this happened
was actually somewhat random.

00:00:30.148 --> 00:00:33.258
Social media first came onto my radar
when I was at college,

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:34.692
my sophomore year of college,

00:00:34.693 --> 00:00:37.149
this is when Facebook
arrived at our campus.

00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:41.118
And at the time, which was
right after the first dotcom bust,

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:45.091
I had had a dorm room business,
I'd had to shut it down in the bust,

00:00:45.092 --> 00:00:47.909
and then, suddenly, this other kid
from Harvard, named Mark,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.078
had this product called Facebook
and people being excited about it.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.049
So in sort of a fit of somewhat
immature professional jealousy,

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.010
I said, "I'm not going to use this thing.

00:00:56.011 --> 00:00:59.091
I won't help this kid's business;
whatever's going to amount to."

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:01.369
As I go along my life,
I look up not long later,

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.750
and I see everyone I know
is hooked on this thing.

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:05.300
And from the clarity you can get

00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:07.892
when you have some objectivity,
some perspective on it,

00:01:07.893 --> 00:01:10.282
I realized this seems
a little bit dangerous.

00:01:10.283 --> 00:01:11.683
So I never signed up.

00:01:11.684 --> 00:01:14.154
I've never had
a social media account since.

00:01:14.155 --> 00:01:17.214
So I'm here for two reasons;
I want to deliver two messages.

00:01:17.215 --> 00:01:19.134
The first message I want to deliver

00:01:19.135 --> 00:01:22.734
is that even though I've never had
a social media account,

00:01:22.735 --> 00:01:25.055
I'm OK, you don't have to worry.

00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:28.234
It turns out I still have friends,

00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:30.245
I still know what's going on in the world;

00:01:30.365 --> 00:01:31.824
as a computer scientist

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:34.324
I still collaborate with people
all around the world,

00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:37.414
I'm still regularly exposed
serendipitously to interesting ideas,

00:01:37.415 --> 00:01:41.065
and I rarely describe myself
as lacking entertainment options.

00:01:41.585 --> 00:01:44.164
So I've been OK,
but I'd go even farther and say

00:01:44.165 --> 00:01:49.138
not only I am OK without social media
but I think I'm actually better off.

00:01:49.497 --> 00:01:54.046
I think I'm happier, I think I find
more sustainability in my life,

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:56.773
and I think I've been
more successful professionally

00:01:56.774 --> 00:01:58.847
because I don't use social media.

00:01:59.867 --> 00:02:01.736
So my second goal here on stage

00:02:01.737 --> 00:02:05.478
is try to convince more of you
to believe the same thing.

00:02:05.998 --> 00:02:08.436
Let's see if I could actually
convince more of you

00:02:08.437 --> 00:02:11.477
that you too would be better off
if you quit social media.

00:02:11.478 --> 00:02:15.026
So, if the theme of this TEDx event
is "Future Tense,"

00:02:15.027 --> 00:02:18.036
I guess, in other words,
this would be my vision of the future,

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:21.047
would be one in which fewer people
actually use social media.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.847
That's a big claim,
I think I need to back it up.

00:02:23.848 --> 00:02:25.296
So I thought, what I would do

00:02:25.297 --> 00:02:28.648
is take the three most
common objections I hear

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:31.448
when I suggest to people
that they quit social media,

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:34.568
and then for each of these objections,
I'll try to defuse the hype

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.250
and see if I can actually
push in some more reality.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.170
This is the first
most common objection I hear.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.035
That's not a hermit,

00:02:44.036 --> 00:02:47.649
that's actually a hipster web developer
down from 8th Street; I'm not sure.

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:50.360
Hipster or hermit?
Sometimes it's hard to tell.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.449
This first objection goes as follows,

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:56.902
"Cal, social media is one
of the fundamental technologies

00:02:56.903 --> 00:02:58.073
of the 21st century.

00:02:58.083 --> 00:03:02.440
To reject social media would be
an act of extreme [bloodism].

00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:05.599
It would be like riding to work
on a horse or using a rotary phone.

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:08.860
I can't take
such a big stance in my life."

00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:12.411
My reaction to that objection
is I think that is nonsense.

00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:16.020
Social media is not
a fundamental technology.

00:03:16.021 --> 00:03:18.051
It leverages
some fundamental technologies,

00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:20.771
but it's better understood as this.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:24.000
Which is to say,
it's a source of entertainment,

00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:25.471
it's an entertainment product.

00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:27.834
The way that technologist
Jaron Lanier puts it

00:03:27.861 --> 00:03:31.980
is that these companies
offer you shiny treats

00:03:31.981 --> 00:03:35.831
in exchange for minutes of your attention
and bites of your personal data,

00:03:35.832 --> 00:03:38.770
which can then be packaged up and sold.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.007
So to say that you don't use social media
should not be a large social stance,

00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:46.681
it's just rejecting one form
of entertainment for others.

00:03:46.682 --> 00:03:49.027
There should be no more
controversial than saying,

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:52.047
"I don't like newspapers,
I like to get my news from magazines,"

00:03:52.048 --> 00:03:55.945
or "I prefer to watch cable series,
as opposed to network television series."

00:03:55.946 --> 00:03:58.585
It's not a major political
or social stance

00:03:58.586 --> 00:04:00.875
to say you don't use this product.

00:04:00.876 --> 00:04:04.294
My use of the slot machine image
up here also is not accidental

00:04:04.295 --> 00:04:07.224
because if you look a little bit closer
at these technologies,

00:04:07.225 --> 00:04:09.714
it's not just that they're
a source of entertainment

00:04:09.715 --> 00:04:12.347
but they're a somewhat
unsavory source of entertainment.

00:04:12.348 --> 00:04:15.036
We now know that many
of the major social media companies

00:04:15.037 --> 00:04:17.714
hire individuals
called attention engineers,

00:04:17.714 --> 00:04:20.204
who borrow principles
from Las Vegas casino gambling,

00:04:20.204 --> 00:04:21.483
among other places,

00:04:21.483 --> 00:04:25.385
to try to make these products
as addictive as possible.

00:04:25.386 --> 00:04:27.587
That is the desired
use case of these products:

00:04:27.707 --> 00:04:31.432
is that you use it in an addictive fashion
because that maximizes the profit

00:04:31.433 --> 00:04:34.893
that can be extracted
from your attention and data.

00:04:34.894 --> 00:04:36.685
So it's not a fundamental technology,

00:04:36.686 --> 00:04:39.145
it's just a source of entertainment,
one among many,

00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:42.117
and it's somewhat unsavory
if you look a little bit closer.

00:04:42.927 --> 00:04:44.925
Here's the second common objection I hear

00:04:44.926 --> 00:04:47.032
when I suggest that people
quit social media.

00:04:47.033 --> 00:04:48.502
The objection goes as follows,

00:04:48.503 --> 00:04:50.324
"Cal, I can't quit social media

00:04:50.325 --> 00:04:54.984
because it is vital to my success
in the 21st century economy.

00:04:54.985 --> 00:04:58.545
If I do not have a well-cultivated
social media brand,

00:04:58.546 --> 00:05:01.536
people won't know who I am,
people won't be able to find me,

00:05:01.537 --> 00:05:03.348
opportunities won't come my way,

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:06.845
and I will effectively
disappear from the economy."

00:05:06.846 --> 00:05:09.135
Again my reaction is once again:

00:05:09.136 --> 00:05:11.986
this objection also is nonsense.

00:05:12.896 --> 00:05:14.905
I recently published this book

00:05:14.906 --> 00:05:19.438
that draws on multiple
different strands of evidence

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:24.050
to make the point that,
in a competitive 21st century economy,

00:05:24.051 --> 00:05:26.200
what the market values

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:30.502
is the ability to produce things
that are rare and are valuable.

00:05:31.256 --> 00:05:33.601
If you produce something
that's rare and valuable,

00:05:33.602 --> 00:05:34.987
the market will value that.

00:05:34.988 --> 00:05:37.787
What the market dismisses,
for the most part,

00:05:37.788 --> 00:05:41.887
are activities that are easy to replicate
and produce a small amount of value.

00:05:42.617 --> 00:05:46.017
Well, social media use is the epitome

00:05:46.018 --> 00:05:49.292
of an easy to replicate activity
that doesn't produce a lot of value;

00:05:49.293 --> 00:05:52.387
it's something that any six-year-old
with a smartphone can do.

00:05:52.388 --> 00:05:53.387
By definition,

00:05:53.388 --> 00:05:56.499
the market is not going to give
a lot of value to those behaviors.

00:05:56.619 --> 00:06:00.557
It's instead going to reward
the deep, concentrated work required

00:06:00.558 --> 00:06:03.938
to build real skills and to apply
those skills to produce things

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:05.628
- like a craftsman -

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:07.639
that are rare and that are valuable.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.130
To put it another way:
if you can write an elegant algorithm,

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.648
if you can write a legal brief
that can change a case,

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:17.799
if you can write a thousand words of prose

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.097
that's going to fixate
a reader right to the end;

00:06:20.217 --> 00:06:23.870
if you can look at a sea of ambiguous data

00:06:23.871 --> 00:06:25.989
and apply statistics,
and pull out insights

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.999
that could transform a business strategy,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.020
if you can do these type of activities
which require deep work,

00:06:31.021 --> 00:06:34.352
that produce outcomes
that are rare and valuable,

00:06:34.353 --> 00:06:36.160
people will find you.

00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:38.171
You will be able to write your own ticket,

00:06:38.172 --> 00:06:41.665
and build the foundation of a meaningful
and successful professional life,

00:06:41.785 --> 00:06:45.734
regardless of how many
Instagram followers you have.

00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:51.235
This is the third comment objection I hear

00:06:51.236 --> 00:06:53.720
when I suggest to people
that they quit social media;

00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:56.600
in some sense, I think it might be
one of the most important.

00:06:56.601 --> 00:06:58.150
This objection goes as follows,

00:06:58.151 --> 00:07:01.741
"Cal, maybe I agree, maybe you're right;
it's not a fundamental technology.

00:07:01.742 --> 00:07:06.051
Maybe using social media is not
at the core of my professional success.

00:07:06.052 --> 00:07:07.421
But, you know what?

00:07:07.422 --> 00:07:11.700
It's harmless, I have some fun on it
- weird: Twitter's funny -

00:07:11.701 --> 00:07:14.091
I don't even use it that much,
I'm a first adopter,

00:07:14.092 --> 00:07:16.030
it's kind of interesting to try it out,

00:07:16.031 --> 00:07:18.642
and maybe I might miss out
something if I don't use it.

00:07:18.643 --> 00:07:20.222
What's the harm?"

00:07:20.232 --> 00:07:25.022
Again, I look back and I say:
this objection also is nonsense.

00:07:25.632 --> 00:07:29.401
In this case, what it misses is
what I think is a very important reality

00:07:29.402 --> 00:07:31.731
that we need to talk about more frankly,

00:07:31.732 --> 00:07:34.331
which is that social media brings with it

00:07:34.332 --> 00:07:37.402
multiple, well-documented,
and significant harms.

00:07:38.812 --> 00:07:41.392
We actually have to confront
these harms head-on

00:07:41.393 --> 00:07:42.791
when trying to make decisions

00:07:42.792 --> 00:07:45.643
about whether or not
we embrace this technology

00:07:45.644 --> 00:07:47.583
and let it into our lives.

00:07:48.183 --> 00:07:50.853
One of these harms
that we know this technology brings

00:07:50.854 --> 00:07:53.603
has to do with your professional success.

00:07:53.604 --> 00:07:57.503
I just argued before
that the ability to focus intensely,

00:07:57.504 --> 00:07:59.642
to produce things
that are rare and valuable,

00:07:59.643 --> 00:08:01.605
to hone skills the market place value on,

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:03.785
that this is
what will matter in our economy.

00:08:03.786 --> 00:08:05.555
But right before that,

00:08:05.556 --> 00:08:10.523
I argued that social media tools
are designed to be addictive.

00:08:10.524 --> 00:08:13.361
The actual designed
desired-use case of these tools

00:08:13.362 --> 00:08:15.933
is that you fragment your attention
as much as possible

00:08:15.934 --> 00:08:17.323
throughout your waking hours;

00:08:17.324 --> 00:08:19.473
that's how these tools
are designed to use.

00:08:19.474 --> 00:08:21.893
We have a growing amount
of research which tells us

00:08:21.894 --> 00:08:24.545
that if you spend
large portions of your day

00:08:24.546 --> 00:08:27.123
in a state of fragmented attention -

00:08:27.124 --> 00:08:29.708
large portions of your day,
breaking up your attention,

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:33.346
to take a quick glance, to just check,
- "Let me quickly look at Instagram" -

00:08:33.466 --> 00:08:36.950
that this can permanently reduce
your capacity for concentration.

00:08:37.414 --> 00:08:40.142
In other words, you could
permanently reduce your capacity

00:08:40.143 --> 00:08:42.124
to do exactly the type of deep effort

00:08:42.125 --> 00:08:45.355
that we're finding to be
more and more necessary

00:08:45.356 --> 00:08:47.256
in an increasingly competitive economy.

00:08:47.257 --> 00:08:48.996
So social media use is not harmless,

00:08:48.997 --> 00:08:51.476
it can actually have
a significant negative impact

00:08:51.477 --> 00:08:53.845
on your ability to thrive in the economy.

00:08:53.846 --> 00:08:57.291
I'm especially worried about this
when we look at the younger generation,

00:08:57.292 --> 00:08:59.493
which is the most saturated
in this technology.

00:08:59.613 --> 00:09:02.537
If you lose your ability
to sustain concentration,

00:09:02.538 --> 00:09:06.408
you're going to become less and less
relevant to this economy.

00:09:06.409 --> 00:09:09.832
There's also psychological harms
that are well documented

00:09:09.833 --> 00:09:13.038
that social media brings,
that we do need to address.

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:16.448
We know from the research literature
that the more you use social media,

00:09:16.449 --> 00:09:19.708
the more likely you are
to feel lonely or isolated.

00:09:19.709 --> 00:09:23.407
We know that the constant exposure

00:09:23.408 --> 00:09:27.734
to your friends carefully curated,
positive portrayals of their life

00:09:27.735 --> 00:09:31.319
can leave you to feel inadequate,
and can increase rates of depression.

00:09:31.921 --> 00:09:35.558
And something I think we're going to be
hearing more about in the near future

00:09:35.559 --> 00:09:37.909
is that there's a fundamental mismatch

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.950
between the way our brains are wired

00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:43.429
and this behavior
of exposing yourself to stimuli

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.378
with intermittent rewards
throughout all of your waking hours.

00:09:46.379 --> 00:09:49.838
It's one thing to spend a couple of hours
at a slot machine in Las Vegas,

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:53.099
but if you bring one with you,
and you pull that handle all day long,

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.379
from when you wake up to when you go
to bed: we're not wired from it.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.720
It short-circuits the brain,

00:09:57.721 --> 00:10:00.736
and we're starting to find
it has actual cognitive consequences,

00:10:00.856 --> 00:10:04.625
one of them being this sort of
pervasive background hum of anxiety.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.879
The canary in the coal mine for this issue
is actually college campuses.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:13.419
If you talk to mental health experts
on college campuses, they'll tell you

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.919
that along with the rise
of ubiquitous smartphone use

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.460
and social media use
among the students on the campus,

00:10:18.461 --> 00:10:22.629
came an explosion of anxiety-related
disorders on those campuses.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.299
That's the canary in the coal mine.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.969
This type of behavior
is a mismatch for our brain wiring

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:28.570
and can make you feel miserable.

00:10:28.571 --> 00:10:32.161
So there's real cost to social media use;

00:10:32.162 --> 00:10:35.464
which means when you're trying to decide,
"Should I use this or not?",

00:10:35.465 --> 00:10:37.140
saying it's harmless is not enough.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.710
You actually have to identify
a significantly positive, clear benefit

00:10:41.711 --> 00:10:45.962
that can outweigh these potential,
completely non-trivial harms.

00:10:47.912 --> 00:10:48.911
People often ask,

00:10:48.912 --> 00:10:51.561
"OK, but what is life like
without social media?"

00:10:51.562 --> 00:10:54.141
That can actually be
a little bit scary to think about.

00:10:54.142 --> 00:10:56.471
According to people
who went through this process,

00:10:56.472 --> 00:10:58.147
there can be a few difficult weeks.

00:10:58.267 --> 00:11:00.251
It actually is like a true detox process.

00:11:00.252 --> 00:11:02.981
The first two weeks can be uncomfortable:

00:11:02.982 --> 00:11:06.152
you feel a little bit anxious,
you feel like you're missing a limb.

00:11:06.153 --> 00:11:08.091
But after that, things settle down,

00:11:08.092 --> 00:11:11.903
and actually, life after social media
can be quite positive.

00:11:12.663 --> 00:11:16.312
There's two things I can report back
from the world of no social media use.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.347
First, it can be quite productive.

00:11:20.348 --> 00:11:24.353
I'm a professor at a research institution,
I've written five books,

00:11:24.354 --> 00:11:27.176
I rarely work past 5 pm on a weekday.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.583
Part of the way I'm trying
to able to pull that off

00:11:30.584 --> 00:11:35.334
is because it turns out,
if you treat your attention with respect,

00:11:35.335 --> 00:11:37.965
- so you don't fragment it;
you allow it to stay whole,

00:11:37.966 --> 00:11:39.535
you preserve your concentration -

00:11:39.536 --> 00:11:40.806
when it comes time to work

00:11:40.807 --> 00:11:43.685
you can do one thing after another,
and do it with intensity,

00:11:43.686 --> 00:11:45.465
and intensity can be traded for time.

00:11:45.466 --> 00:11:48.355
It's surprising how much
you can get done in a eight-hour day

00:11:48.356 --> 00:11:52.135
if you're able to give each thing
intense concentration after another.

00:11:52.136 --> 00:11:55.784
Something else I can report back
from life without social media

00:11:55.785 --> 00:11:59.866
is that outside of work,
things can be quite peaceful.

00:12:00.896 --> 00:12:03.657
I often joke I'd be very comfortable
being a 1930s farmer,

00:12:03.667 --> 00:12:05.544
because if you look at my leisure time,

00:12:05.545 --> 00:12:07.655
I read the newspaper
while the sun comes up;

00:12:07.656 --> 00:12:09.315
I listen to baseball on the radio;

00:12:09.316 --> 00:12:11.325
I honest-to-god sit in a leather chair

00:12:11.326 --> 00:12:14.855
and read hardcover books at night
after my kids go to bed.

00:12:14.856 --> 00:12:17.915
It sounds old-fashioned,
but they were onto something back then.

00:12:17.916 --> 00:12:23.527
It's actually a restorative, peaceful way
to actually spend your time out of work.

00:12:23.528 --> 00:12:25.837
You don't have
the constant hum of stimuli,

00:12:25.838 --> 00:12:29.168
and the background hum of anxiety
that comes along with that.

00:12:29.169 --> 00:12:32.419
So life without social media
is really not so bad.

00:12:32.959 --> 00:12:35.818
If you pull together these threads,
you see my full argument

00:12:35.819 --> 00:12:39.268
that not everyone, but certainly
much more people than right now,

00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:41.728
much more people
should not be using social media.

00:12:41.729 --> 00:12:44.368
That's because we can first, to summarize,

00:12:44.369 --> 00:12:46.059
discard with the main concerns

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.453
that it's a fundamental
technology you have to use.

00:12:48.573 --> 00:12:50.669
Nonsense: it's a slot machine
in your phone.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.870
We can discard with this notion
that you won't get a job without it.

00:12:53.871 --> 00:12:56.629
Nonsense: anything a six-year-old
with a smartphone can do

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:58.678
is not going to be
what the market rewards.

00:12:58.679 --> 00:13:01.869
And then I emphasized the point
that there's real harms with it.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:03.139
So it's not just harmless.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.533
You really would have to have
a significant benefit

00:13:05.534 --> 00:13:07.854
before you would say
this trade-off is worth it.

00:13:07.855 --> 00:13:10.510
Finally I noted,
that life without social media:

00:13:10.511 --> 00:13:13.220
there's real positives associated with it.

00:13:13.221 --> 00:13:17.070
So I'm hoping that when many of you
actually go through this same calculus,

00:13:17.071 --> 00:13:20.109
you'll at least consider
the perspective I'm making right now,

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.849
which is: many more people
would be much better off

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:25.649
if they didn't use this technology.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.040
Some of you might disagree,

00:13:27.041 --> 00:13:31.231
some of you might have scathing
but accurate critiques

00:13:31.232 --> 00:13:32.370
of me and my points,

00:13:32.371 --> 00:13:34.790
and of course, I welcome
all negative feedback.

00:13:34.791 --> 00:13:38.239
I just ask that you direct
your comments towards Twitter.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.490
Thank you.

00:13:39.491 --> 00:13:40.831
(Applause)
