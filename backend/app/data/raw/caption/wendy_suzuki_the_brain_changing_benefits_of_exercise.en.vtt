00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.136
What if I told you there was something
that you can do right now

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.856
that would have an immediate,
positive benefit for your brain

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.560
including your mood and your focus?

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.616
And what if I told you that same thing
could actually last a long time

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.296
and protect your brain
from different conditions

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.256
like depression,
Alzheimer's disease or dementia.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.936
Would you do it?

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.176
Yes!

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.696
I am talking about the powerful effects
of physical activity.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.136
Simply moving your body,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.400
has immediate, long-lasting
and protective benefits for your brain.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.136
And that can last
for the rest of your life.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.536
So what I want to do today
is tell you a story

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.176
about how I used my deep
understanding of neuroscience,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.936
as a professor of neuroscience,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.776
to essentially do an experiment on myself

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.816
in which I discovered
the science underlying

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.696
why exercise
is the most transformative thing

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.720
that you can do for your brain today.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.056
Now, as a neuroscientist,
I know that our brains,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.136
that is the thing in our head right now,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.256
that is the most complex structure
known to humankind.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.936
But it's one thing
to talk about the brain,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.400
and it's another to see it.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.736
So here is a real preserved human brain.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.616
And it's going to illustrate two key areas
that we are going to talk about today.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.896
The first is the prefrontal cortex,
right behind your forehead,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.800
critical for things like decision-making,
focus, attention and your personality.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.616
The second key area is located
in the temporal lobe, shown right here.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.776
You have two temporal lobes in your brain,
the right and the left,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.416
and deep in the temporal lobe
is a key structure

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.136
critical for your ability

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.616
to form and retain new long-term
memories for facts and events.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.776
And that structure
is called the hippocampus.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.160
So I've always been fascinated
with the hippocampus.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.456
How could it be that an event
that lasts just a moment,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.696
say, your first kiss,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.176
or the moment your first child was born,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.256
can form a memory
that has changed your brain,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.616
that lasts an entire lifetime?

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.656
That's what I want to understand.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.776
I wanted to start and record
the activity of individual brain cells

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.416
in the hippocampus

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.616
as subjects were forming new memories.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.936
And essentially try and decode how
those brief bursts of electrical activity,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.896
which is how neurons
communicate with each other,

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.520
how those brief bursts either allowed us
to form a new memory, or did not.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.296
But a few years ago,
I did something very unusual in science.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.456
As a full professor of neural science,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.280
I decided to completely switch
my research program.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.136
Because I encountered something
that was so amazing,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.216
with the potential to change so many lives

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.496
that I had to study it.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:18.336
I discovered and I experienced
the brain-changing effects of exercise.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.536
And I did it in a completely
inadvertent way.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.376
I was actually at the height
of all the memory work that I was doing --

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.016
data was pouring in,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.576
I was becoming known in my field
for all of this memory work.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.200
And it should have been going great.
It was, scientifically.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.656
But when I stuck my head
out of my lab door,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.920
I noticed something.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.376
I had no social life.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.136
I spent too much time
listening to those brain cells

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.736
in a dark room, by myself.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.896
(Laughter)

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.536
I didn't move my body at all.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.296
I had gained 25 pounds.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.136
And actually, it took me
many years to realize it,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.616
I was actually miserable.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.336
And I shouldn't be miserable.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.816
And I went on a river-rafting trip --
by myself, because I had no social life.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.096
And I came back --

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.136
(Laughter)

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.616
thinking, "Oh, my God,
I was the weakest person on that trip."

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.176
And I came back with a mission.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.856
I said, "I'm never going to feel
like the weakest person

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.376
on a river-rafting trip again."

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.376
And that's what made me go to the gym.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.896
And I focused my type-A personality

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.856
on going to all the exercise
classes at the gym.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.776
I tried everything.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.736
I went to kickbox,
dance, yoga, step class,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.896
and at first it was really hard.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.896
But what I noticed is that after every
sweat-inducing workout that I tried,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.816
I had this great mood boost
and this great energy boost.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.576
And that's what kept me
going back to the gym.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.176
Well, I started feeling stronger.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.816
I started feeling better,
I even lost that 25 pounds.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.840
And now, fast-forward a year and a half
into this regular exercise program

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.016
and I noticed something that really
made me sit up and take notice.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.016
I was sitting at my desk,
writing a research grant,

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.096
and a thought went through my mind

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.776
that had never gone
through my mind before.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.656
And that thought was,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.976
"Gee, grant-writing is going well today."

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.296
And all the scientists --

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.336
(Laughter)

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.936
yeah, all the scientists
always laugh when I say that,

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.976
because grant-writing never goes well.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.816
It is so hard; you're always
pulling your hair out,

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.096
trying to come up with that
million-dollar-winning idea.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.376
But I realized that
the grant-writing was going well,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.736
because I was able
to focus and maintain my attention

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.776
for longer than I had before.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.776
And my long-term memory --
what I was studying in my own lab --

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.640
seemed to be better in me.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.616
And that's when I put it together.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.856
Maybe all that exercise
that I had included and added to my life

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.096
was changing my brain.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.136
Maybe I did an experiment on myself
without even knowing it.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.776
So as a curious neuroscientist,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.496
I went to the literature to see
what I could find about what we knew

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.616
about the effects
of exercise on the brain.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.776
And what I found was an exciting
and a growing literature

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.976
that was essentially showing everything
that I noticed in myself.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.960
Better mood, better energy,
better memory, better attention.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.776
And the more I learned,

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.176
the more I realized
how powerful exercise was.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.376
Which eventually
led me to the big decision

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.136
to completely shift my research focus.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.056
And so now, after several years
of really focusing on this question,

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.976
I've come to the following conclusion:

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.496
that exercise is
the most transformative thing

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.776
that you can do for your brain today

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.896
for the following three reasons.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.696
Number one: it has
immediate effects on your brain.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.736
A single workout that you do

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.376
will immediately increase
levels of neurotransmitters

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.936
like dopamine, serotonin
and noradrenaline.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.216
That is going to increase your mood
right after that workout,

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.816
exactly what I was feeling.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.296
My lab showed that a single workout

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.896
can improve your ability
to shift and focus attention,

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.856
and that focus improvement
will last for at least two hours.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.496
And finally, studies have shown

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.896
that a single workout
will improve your reaction times

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.176
which basically means

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.536
that you are going to be faster
at catching that cup of Starbucks

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.296
that falls off the counter,

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.056
which is very, very important.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.096
(Laughter)

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.040
But these immediate effects are transient,
they help you right after.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.536
What you have to do is do what I did,

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.576
that is change your exercise regime,
increase your cardiorespiratory function,

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.936
to get the long-lasting effects.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.216
And these effects are long-lasting

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.656
because exercise actually
changes the brain's anatomy,

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.680
physiology and function.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.600
Let's start with my favorite
brain area, the hippocampus.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.736
The hippocampus --

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:58.216
or exercise actually
produces brand new brain cells,

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.896
new brain cells in the hippocampus,
that actually increase its volume,

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.256
as well as improve
your long-term memory, OK?

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.720
And that including in you and me.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.016
Number two: the most common finding
in neuroscience studies,

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.656
looking at effects of long-term exercise,

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.056
is improved attention function
dependent on your prefrontal cortex.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.536
You not only get
better focus and attention,

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.136
but the volume of the hippocampus
increases as well.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:32.136
And finally, you not only get
immediate effects of mood with exercise

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.816
but those last for a long time.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:39.200
So you get long-lasting increases
in those good mood neurotransmitters.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.496
But really, the most transformative thing
that exercise will do

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.696
is its protective effects on your brain.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.576
Here you can think
about the brain like a muscle.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.256
The more you're working out,

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:57.120
the bigger and stronger your hippocampus
and prefrontal cortex gets.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.936
Why is that important?

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.736
Because the prefrontal cortex
and the hippocampus

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:07.536
are the two areas that are most
susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.480
and normal cognitive decline in aging.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.136
So with increased exercise
over your lifetime,

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.296
you're not going to cure
dementia or Alzheimer's disease,

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.816
but what you're going to do
is you're going to create

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.496
the strongest, biggest hippocampus
and prefrontal cortex

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.960
so it takes longer for these diseases
to actually have an effect.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.336
You can think of exercise, therefore,

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.776
as a supercharged 401K for your brain, OK?

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.680
And it's even better, because it's free.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.776
So this is the point in the talk
where everybody says,

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.936
"That sounds so interesting, Wendy,

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.496
but I really will only
want to know one thing.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.416
And that is, just tell me
the minimum amount of exercise

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.296
I need to get all these changes."

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.336
(Laughter)

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.176
And so I'm going to tell you
the answer to that question.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.496
First, good news: you don't have to become
a triathlete to get these effects.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.056
The rule of thumb is you want to get
three to four times a week exercise

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.496
minimum 30 minutes an exercise session,

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.176
and you want to get aerobic exercise in.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.176
That is, get your heart rate up.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.696
And the good news is,
you don't have to go to the gym

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.736
to get a very expensive gym membership.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.456
Add an extra walk around the block
in your power walk.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.936
You see stairs -- take stairs.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.056
And power-vacuuming can be as good
as the aerobics class

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.960
that you were going to take at the gym.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.856
So I've gone from memory pioneer

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.656
to exercise explorer.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.496
From going into the innermost
workings of the brain,

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:45.736
to trying to understand how exercise
can improve our brain function,

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.576
and my goal in my lab right now

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.736
is to go beyond that rule of thumb
that I just gave you --

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.656
three to four times a week, 30 minutes.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.896
I want to understand
the optimum exercise prescription

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.896
for you, at your age,
at your fitness level,

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.816
for your genetic background,

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.616
to maximize the effects of exercise today

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.936
and also to improve your brain
and protect your brain the best

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.736
for the rest of your life.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.816
But it's one thing to talk about exercise,
and it's another to do it.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.576
So I'm going to invoke my power
as a certified exercise instructor,

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.176
to ask you all to stand up.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.056
(Laughter)

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.336
We're going to do
just one minute of exercise.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.856
It's call-and-response,
just do what I do, say what I say,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.016
and make sure you don't punch
your neighbor, OK?

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.256
Music!

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.896
(Upbeat music)

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.416
Five, six, seven, eight,
it's right, left, right, left.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.136
And I say, I am strong now.

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.376
Let's hear you.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.416
Audience: I am strong now.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:56.096
Wendy Suzuki: Ladies,
I am Wonder Woman-strong.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.336
Let's hear you!

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.256
Audience: I am Wonder Woman-strong.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.896
WS: New move -- uppercut, right and left.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.816
I am inspired now. You say it!

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.176
Audience: I am inspired now.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.096
WS: Last move -- pull it down,
right and left, right and left.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:18.896
I say, I am on fire now! You say it.

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.216
Audience: I am on fire now.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.736
WS: And done! OK, good job!

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.976
(Applause)

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.616
Thank you.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:34.416
I want to leave you with one last thought.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.896
And that is, bringing
exercise in your life

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.896
will not only give you
a happier, more protective life today,

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:47.496
but it will protect your brain
from incurable diseases.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:52.656
And in this way it will change
the trajectory of your life

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.896
for the better.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.136
Thank you very much.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.416
(Applause)

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.656
Thank you.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.880
(Applause)
