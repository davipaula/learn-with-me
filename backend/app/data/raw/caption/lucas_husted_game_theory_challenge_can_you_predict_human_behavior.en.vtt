00:00:06.646 --> 00:00:10.302
A few months ago we posed a challenge 
to our community.

00:00:10.302 --> 00:00:15.192
We asked everyone: given a range of 
integers from 0 to 100,

00:00:15.192 --> 00:00:22.056
guess the whole number closest to 2/3 
of the average of all numbers guessed.

00:00:22.056 --> 00:00:26.776
So if the average of all guesses is 60, 
the correct guess will be 40.

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:31.414
What number do you think was the 
correct guess at 2/3 of the average?

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:36.107
Let’s see if we can try and reason 
our way to the answer.

00:00:36.107 --> 00:00:41.406
This game is played under conditions known
to game theorists as common knowledge.

00:00:41.406 --> 00:00:44.499
Not only does every player have 
the same information —

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:46.706
they also know that everyone else does,

00:00:46.706 --> 00:00:52.618
and that everyone else knows that 
everyone else does, and so on, infinitely.

00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:58.538
Now, the highest possible average would 
occur if every person guessed 100.

00:00:58.538 --> 00:01:03.268
In that case, 2/3 of the average 
would be 66.66.

00:01:03.268 --> 00:01:05.205
Since everyone can figure this out,

00:01:05.205 --> 00:01:09.625
it wouldn’t make sense to guess 
anything higher than 67.

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:12.748
If everyone playing comes to 
this same conclusion,

00:01:12.748 --> 00:01:15.517
no one will guess higher than 67.

00:01:15.517 --> 00:01:19.659
Now 67 is the new highest 
possible average,

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.439
so no reasonable guess should be 
higher than ⅔ of that, which is 44.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.980
This logic can be extended further 
and further.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.710
With each step, the highest possible 
logical answer keeps getting smaller.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.275
So it would seem sensible to guess the 
lowest number possible.

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:41.133
And indeed, if everyone chose zero,

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:45.065
the game would reach what’s known 
as a Nash Equilibrium.

00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:49.419
This is a state where every player has 
chosen the best possible strategy

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:52.524
for themselves given 
everyone else playing,

00:01:52.524 --> 00:01:57.334
and no individual player can benefit 
by choosing differently.

00:01:57.334 --> 00:02:01.514
But, that’s not what happens 
in the real world.

00:02:01.514 --> 00:02:05.479
People, as it turns out, either aren’t 
perfectly rational,

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.038
or don’t expect each other 
to be perfectly rational.

00:02:09.038 --> 00:02:12.369
Or, perhaps, it’s some combination 
of the two.

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:15.219
When this game is played in 
real-world settings,

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:20.219
the average tends to be somewhere 
between 20 and 35.

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:26.076
Danish newspaper Politiken ran the game 
with over 19,000 readers participating,

00:02:26.076 --> 00:02:32.056
resulting in an average of roughly 22, 
making the correct answer 14.

00:02:32.056 --> 00:02:35.758
For our audience, the average was 31.3.

00:02:35.758 --> 00:02:41.018
So if you guessed 21 as 2/3 of 
the average, well done.

00:02:41.018 --> 00:02:44.681
Economic game theorists have a 
way of modeling this interplay

00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:49.802
between rationality and practicality 
called k-level reasoning.

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:54.642
K stands for the number of times a 
cycle of reasoning is repeated.

00:02:54.642 --> 00:02:58.949
A person playing at k-level 0 would 
approach our game naively,

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:02.676
guessing a number at random without 
thinking about the other players.

00:03:02.676 --> 00:03:07.876
At k-level 1, a player would assume 
everyone else was playing at level 0,

00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:12.416
resulting in an average of 50, 
and thus guess 33.

00:03:12.416 --> 00:03:17.192
At k-level 2, they’d assume that everyone 
else was playing at level 1,

00:03:17.192 --> 00:03:19.492
leading them to guess 22.

00:03:19.492 --> 00:03:23.096
It would take 12 k-levels to reach 0.

00:03:23.096 --> 00:03:27.916
The evidence suggests that most 
people stop at 1 or 2 k-levels.

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:29.395
And that’s useful to know,

00:03:29.395 --> 00:03:34.005
because k-level thinking comes into 
play in high-stakes situations.

00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:39.379
For example, stock traders evaluate stocks
not only based on earnings reports,

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.112
but also on the value that others 
place on those numbers.

00:03:43.112 --> 00:03:45.402
And during penalty kicks in soccer,

00:03:45.402 --> 00:03:49.543
both the shooter and the goalie decide 
whether to go right or left

00:03:49.543 --> 00:03:52.735
based on what they think the other 
person is thinking.

00:03:52.735 --> 00:03:56.691
Goalies often memorize the patterns of 
their opponents ahead of time,

00:03:56.691 --> 00:04:00.288
but penalty shooters know that 
and can plan accordingly.

00:04:00.288 --> 00:04:03.551
In each case, participants must weigh 
their own understanding

00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:07.743
of the best course of action against how 
well they think other participants

00:04:07.743 --> 00:04:10.144
understand the situation.

00:04:10.144 --> 00:04:14.924
But 1 or 2 k-levels is by no means 
a hard and fast rule—

00:04:14.924 --> 00:04:20.345
simply being conscious of this tendency 
can make people adjust their expectations.

00:04:20.345 --> 00:04:24.357
For instance, what would happen 
if people played the 2/3 game

00:04:24.357 --> 00:04:28.250
after understanding the difference between
the most logical approach

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.850
and the most common?

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.291
Submit your own guess at what 2/3 
of the new average will be

00:04:36.233 --> 00:04:37.813
and we’ll find out.
