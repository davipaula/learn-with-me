00:00:16.264 --> 00:00:19.569
Imagine that you're getting ready
to go to a party.

00:00:19.799 --> 00:00:22.923
You feel excited, but also nervous,

00:00:22.924 --> 00:00:25.476
and you've got this feeling
in your stomach

00:00:25.477 --> 00:00:27.845
almost like another heartbeat.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.030
There's something holding you back,
holding you back from getting too happy.

00:00:34.656 --> 00:00:36.494
"No, you mustn't get too happy.

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:41.562
Better to be cautious, otherwise,
something bad might happen."

00:00:41.938 --> 00:00:46.168
You start wondering,
"Who should I talk to when I get there?

00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:52.078
What if no one wants to talk to me?
What if they'll think I'm weird?"

00:00:53.464 --> 00:00:55.062
When you arrive at the party,

00:00:55.063 --> 00:00:58.533
someone comes up to you
and starts talking with you,

00:00:58.534 --> 00:01:00.232
and as this is happening,

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:04.917
your mind starts racing,
your heart begins pounding,

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:06.798
you start sweating,

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.781
and it feels almost like
you're dissociating from yourself,

00:01:10.782 --> 00:01:15.479
like it's an out-of-body experience,
and you're just watching yourself talk.

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:20.611
"Keep it together," you say
to yourself, but you can't.

00:01:20.612 --> 00:01:23.171
And it's just getting worse:

00:01:24.171 --> 00:01:26.076
after a few minutes of conversation,

00:01:26.077 --> 00:01:28.838
the person
you've been speaking to leaves,

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:31.735
and you feel utterly defeated.

00:01:33.344 --> 00:01:38.696
This has been happening to you
in social situations for a long time.

00:01:39.051 --> 00:01:43.074
Or imagine every time you go out,
and you're in crowded places,

00:01:43.075 --> 00:01:46.470
you feel this panic starting to arise.

00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:48.787
When you're surrounded by lots of people,

00:01:48.788 --> 00:01:53.800
like on a bus, you start
to feel hot, nauseous, uneasy,

00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:56.932
and to prevent this from happening,

00:01:56.933 --> 00:02:02.951
you start avoiding a lot of places
which makes you feel lonely and isolated.

00:02:03.816 --> 00:02:08.122
You or the person
in both of these scenarios

00:02:08.124 --> 00:02:10.408
have anxiety disorders,

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.583
and what I can tell you
is that anxiety is very common,

00:02:14.584 --> 00:02:17.473
much more than people think.

00:02:17.474 --> 00:02:21.165
Right now, one in 14 people
around the world

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:23.589
have an anxiety disorder,

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.864
and each year, it costs
over 42 billion dollars

00:02:28.865 --> 00:02:32.844
to treat this mental health problem.

00:02:32.845 --> 00:02:36.097
To show you the impact
that anxiety has on someone's life,

00:02:36.098 --> 00:02:37.378
I will just mention

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.524
that anxiety can lead to depression,
school dropout, suicide.

00:02:44.904 --> 00:02:49.129
It makes it harder to focus,
and to hold down a job,

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:52.589
and it can lead
to relationship breakdown.

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.023
But a lot of people don't know this,

00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:59.084
that's why, a lot of times,
people sweep anxiety under the rug

00:02:59.085 --> 00:03:04.696
as just nerves that you need
to get over, as a weakness,

00:03:05.146 --> 00:03:07.385
but anxiety is so much more than that.

00:03:08.705 --> 00:03:11.856
A reason why so many people
don't think it's important

00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:14.226
is that they don't know what it is.

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:21.227
Is it your personality? Is it an illness?
Is it a normal sensation? What is?

00:03:22.831 --> 00:03:26.072
That's why it's important
to differentiate

00:03:26.073 --> 00:03:30.488
what is normal anxiety
from what is an anxiety disorder.

00:03:32.277 --> 00:03:35.571
Normal anxiety is
an emotion that we all get

00:03:35.572 --> 00:03:38.035
when we're in stressful situations.

00:03:38.036 --> 00:03:41.688
For example, let's say,
you're out in the woods,

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.376
and you come face-to-face with a bear.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.184
This will probably make you feel
a little bit anxious,

00:03:50.185 --> 00:03:53.668
and you'll probably want
to start running like crazy.

00:03:54.354 --> 00:04:00.404
This anxious feeling that you get is good
because it protects you, it saves you,

00:04:00.405 --> 00:04:03.886
and it makes you
on a hightail it out of there,

00:04:03.887 --> 00:04:08.410
although maybe it's not such a good idea
to start running when you see a bear.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.249
I really don't think
you can outrun a bear.

00:04:13.592 --> 00:04:16.935
Anxiety helps us meet
our deadlines at work

00:04:16.935 --> 00:04:19.841
and deal with emergencies in life,

00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:24.287
but when this anxiety emotion
is taken to the extreme

00:04:24.952 --> 00:04:29.231
and arises in situations
which don't pose a real threat,

00:04:29.232 --> 00:04:32.851
then that's when you might have
an anxiety disorder.

00:04:32.852 --> 00:04:36.481
For example, people
with generalized anxiety disorder

00:04:36.482 --> 00:04:41.871
worry excessively and constantly
about everything going on in their lives,

00:04:41.872 --> 00:04:46.552
and they find it very difficult
to control this worry.

00:04:47.745 --> 00:04:52.235
They also have symptoms
like restlessness, fear,

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.490
they find it hard to fall asleep at night,
and they can't concentrate on tasks.

00:04:59.595 --> 00:05:05.974
In spite of whatever kind of anxiety
you might be suffering from,

00:05:05.975 --> 00:05:09.734
there is something
that you can do to lower it.

00:05:09.735 --> 00:05:13.715
It works, and it's simpler
than you may think.

00:05:15.051 --> 00:05:18.500
All too often, we're given
medication for mental disorders,

00:05:18.501 --> 00:05:21.020
but it doesn't always work
in the long run.

00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:25.021
Symptoms often come back,
and you're back to where you started.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.359
So here's something else to consider:

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.249
the way you cope or handle things
has a direct impact

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.250
on how much anxiety you're experiencing,

00:05:37.473 --> 00:05:43.383
and if you tweak the way you're coping,
then you can lower your anxiety.

00:05:45.523 --> 00:05:47.862
In our study
at the University of Cambridge,

00:05:47.863 --> 00:05:51.032
we showed that women living in poor areas

00:05:51.033 --> 00:05:55.362
have a higher risk for anxiety
than women living in richer areas.

00:05:55.363 --> 00:05:59.492
These results didn't surprise us,
but when we looked closer,

00:05:59.493 --> 00:06:02.542
we found that women living in poor areas,

00:06:02.543 --> 00:06:06.382
if they had a particular set
of coping resources,

00:06:06.383 --> 00:06:08.382
they didn't have anxiety,

00:06:08.383 --> 00:06:13.842
while women living in poor areas
without these coping resources

00:06:13.843 --> 00:06:15.153
had anxiety.

00:06:16.078 --> 00:06:17.477
Other studies showed

00:06:17.478 --> 00:06:21.137
that people who had faced
extreme circumstances,

00:06:21.138 --> 00:06:25.267
who had faced adversity, been
through wars and natural disasters,

00:06:25.268 --> 00:06:27.927
if they had coping resources,

00:06:27.928 --> 00:06:31.838
they remained healthy
and free of mental disorders,

00:06:32.093 --> 00:06:36.822
while others, facing the same hardships
but without coping skills

00:06:36.823 --> 00:06:41.483
went on a downward spiral
and developed mental disorders.

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:47.878
So what are
some of these coping resources,

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:52.229
and how can we use them
to lower our anxiety?

00:06:53.275 --> 00:06:55.294
And before I dive into what they are,

00:06:55.295 --> 00:06:58.914
I'd like to point out -
and I think this is so interesting -

00:06:58.915 --> 00:07:05.915
you can develop these coping resources
or coping skills on your own

00:07:05.955 --> 00:07:08.355
through the things that you do;

00:07:09.077 --> 00:07:12.316
you can take charge
of your anxiety and lower it,

00:07:12.317 --> 00:07:14.877
which I think is so empowering.

00:07:17.015 --> 00:07:20.604
Today I'll be talking about
three coping resources,

00:07:20.605 --> 00:07:25.435
and the first one is feeling like
you're in control of your life.

00:07:27.057 --> 00:07:31.436
People who feel like they're
more in control of their life

00:07:31.437 --> 00:07:33.477
have better mental health.

00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:36.868
If you feel like
you're lacking in control in life,

00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:38.498
then research shows

00:07:38.499 --> 00:07:42.669
that you should engage in experiences
that give you greater control.

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:45.295
I'll show you what I mean:

00:07:46.048 --> 00:07:50.207
do you sometimes find that you put off
starting something

00:07:50.208 --> 00:07:52.908
because you just don't feel ready enough?

00:07:53.733 --> 00:07:55.842
Do you find it hard to make decisions

00:07:55.843 --> 00:08:01.693
like what to wear, what to eat
who to date, which job to take up?

00:08:02.819 --> 00:08:05.818
Do you tend to waste a lot of time

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:09.819
deciding what you might do
while nothing gets done?

00:08:11.973 --> 00:08:16.763
A way to overcome indecision
and this lack of control in life,

00:08:16.979 --> 00:08:19.139
is to do it badly.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.459
There's a quote by writer
and poet GK Chesterton

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:30.760
that says, "Anything worth doing
is worth doing badly the first time."

00:08:32.003 --> 00:08:34.361
The reason why this works so well

00:08:34.363 --> 00:08:39.792
is that it speeds up your decision-making
and catapults you straight into action,

00:08:39.793 --> 00:08:42.472
otherwise, you can spend hours

00:08:42.472 --> 00:08:45.932
deciding how you should go
about doing something

00:08:45.933 --> 00:08:47.693
or what you should do.

00:08:48.091 --> 00:08:53.221
This can be paralyzing and can make
you afraid to even begin.

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:59.331
All too often, we aim for perfection,
but never end up doing anything

00:08:59.332 --> 00:09:01.871
because the standards
that we set for ourselves

00:09:01.872 --> 00:09:05.051
are too high, they're intimidating,

00:09:05.052 --> 00:09:09.051
which stresses us out
so we delay starting something,

00:09:09.052 --> 00:09:13.052
or we might even abandon
the whole thing altogether.

00:09:14.716 --> 00:09:17.786
Do it badly frees you up to take action.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.259
I mean you know how it is:

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.979
so often, we want to do
something perfectly we can't start

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.980
until it's the perfect time,
until we've got all the skills,

00:09:29.768 --> 00:09:33.768
but this can be daunting and stressful

00:09:34.027 --> 00:09:37.416
so why not just jump into it
just do it however,

00:09:37.417 --> 00:09:39.907
without worrying if it's good or bad?

00:09:40.392 --> 00:09:43.961
This will make it that much easier
to start something

00:09:43.962 --> 00:09:47.072
and as you're doing it badly to finish it,

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.669
and when you look back,

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:53.810
you'll realize, more often than not,
that actually it's not that bad.

00:09:56.007 --> 00:09:58.196
A close friend of mine who has anxiety

00:09:58.197 --> 00:10:01.937
started using this motto,
and this is what she said,

00:10:03.142 --> 00:10:07.511
"When I started using this motto,
my life transformed.

00:10:07.512 --> 00:10:12.732
I found I could complete tasks
in much shorter time periods than before.

00:10:13.887 --> 00:10:20.297
Do it badly gave me wings to take risks,
to try something differently,

00:10:20.818 --> 00:10:25.598
and to have way more fun
during the whole process.

00:10:26.562 --> 00:10:32.472
It took the anxiety out of everything
and replaced it with excitement."

00:10:34.113 --> 00:10:41.063
So do it badly, and you can improve
as you go along.

00:10:42.589 --> 00:10:46.119
I'd like to ask you to think about this:

00:10:46.333 --> 00:10:53.333
if you start using this motto today,
how would your life change?

00:10:57.743 --> 00:11:01.743
The second coping strategy
is to forgive yourself,

00:11:02.216 --> 00:11:05.116
and this is very powerful if you use it.

00:11:06.381 --> 00:11:09.620
People with anxiety think a lot about

00:11:09.621 --> 00:11:15.941
what they're doing wrong, their worries,
and how bad they're feeling.

00:11:16.815 --> 00:11:22.285
Imagine if you had a friend
who constantly pointed out

00:11:22.453 --> 00:11:25.242
everything you're doing wrong,

00:11:25.243 --> 00:11:28.722
and everything
that was wrong with your life.

00:11:28.723 --> 00:11:30.092
You would probably want

00:11:30.093 --> 00:11:33.243
to get rid of this person
right away, wouldn't you?

00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:40.219
Well, people with anxiety
do this to themselves all day long.

00:11:40.505 --> 00:11:42.595
They're not kind to themselves.

00:11:42.939 --> 00:11:46.939
So maybe it's time to start
being kinder with ourselves,

00:11:47.473 --> 00:11:50.313
time to start supporting ourselves,

00:11:50.834 --> 00:11:54.283
and a way to do this
is to forgive yourself

00:11:54.284 --> 00:11:55.733
for any mistakes you think

00:11:55.734 --> 00:11:58.414
you might have made
just a few moments ago

00:11:58.766 --> 00:12:00.876
to mistakes made in the past.

00:12:02.221 --> 00:12:05.180
If you had a panic attack
and are embarrassed about it,

00:12:05.181 --> 00:12:06.741
forgive yourself;

00:12:07.231 --> 00:12:10.171
if you wanted to talk to someone,

00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:12.648
but couldn't muster up
the courage to do so,

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:14.559
don't worry about it, let it go;

00:12:14.947 --> 00:12:17.946
forgive yourself
for anything and everything

00:12:17.947 --> 00:12:22.467
and this will give you
greater compassion towards yourself.

00:12:23.547 --> 00:12:26.667
You can't begin to heal until you do this.

00:12:28.094 --> 00:12:31.044
And last but not least,

00:12:32.081 --> 00:12:34.920
having a purpose and meaning in life

00:12:34.921 --> 00:12:37.871
is a very important coping mechanism.

00:12:39.238 --> 00:12:43.328
Whatever we do in life,
whatever work we produce,

00:12:43.915 --> 00:12:46.034
however much money we make,

00:12:46.035 --> 00:12:51.185
we cannot be fully happy until we know
that someone else needs us,

00:12:51.799 --> 00:12:55.428
that someone else depends on
our accomplishments,

00:12:55.429 --> 00:12:58.089
or on the love that we have to share.

00:12:59.744 --> 00:13:00.973
It's not that we need

00:13:00.974 --> 00:13:04.553
other people's good words
to keep going in life,

00:13:04.554 --> 00:13:08.093
but if we don't do something
with someone else in mind,

00:13:08.094 --> 00:13:11.804
then we're at much higher risk
for poor mental health.

00:13:13.642 --> 00:13:17.282
The famous neurologist
Dr. Victor Frankel said,

00:13:17.771 --> 00:13:21.380
"For people who think
there's nothing to live for

00:13:21.381 --> 00:13:24.551
and nothing more to expect from life,

00:13:24.742 --> 00:13:27.651
the question is getting
these people to realize

00:13:27.652 --> 00:13:32.082
that life is still expecting
something from them."

00:13:35.601 --> 00:13:40.611
Doing something with someone else in mind
can carry you through the toughest times.

00:13:41.493 --> 00:13:44.192
You'll know the why for your existence

00:13:44.193 --> 00:13:50.133
and will be able to bear
almost any how; almost any how.

00:13:52.771 --> 00:13:55.541
So the question is

00:13:56.324 --> 00:14:00.154
do you do at least one thing
with someone else in mind?

00:14:01.127 --> 00:14:02.867
This could be volunteering,

00:14:03.682 --> 00:14:08.941
or it could be sharing this knowledge
that you gained today with other people,

00:14:08.942 --> 00:14:11.372
especially those who need it most,

00:14:11.511 --> 00:14:15.230
and these are often the people
who don't have money for therapy,

00:14:15.231 --> 00:14:16.730
and they're usually the ones

00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:19.821
with the highest rates
of anxiety disorders.

00:14:20.232 --> 00:14:22.621
Give it to them, share with others,

00:14:22.622 --> 00:14:26.352
because it can really improve
your mental health.

00:14:30.317 --> 00:14:32.857
So I would like to conclude with this:

00:14:35.224 --> 00:14:39.423
another way you can do something
with someone else in mind

00:14:39.424 --> 00:14:44.244
is finishing work that might benefit
future generations.

00:14:45.614 --> 00:14:50.513
Even if these people will never realize
what you've done for them,

00:14:50.514 --> 00:14:51.793
it doesn't matter,

00:14:51.794 --> 00:14:57.113
because you will know,
and this will make you realize

00:14:57.114 --> 00:15:01.904
the uniqueness
and importance of your life.

00:15:02.737 --> 00:15:04.016
Thank you.

00:15:04.017 --> 00:15:05.347
(Applause)
