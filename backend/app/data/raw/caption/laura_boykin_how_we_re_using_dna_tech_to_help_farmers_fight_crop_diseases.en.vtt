00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:15.317
I get out of bed for two reasons.

00:00:15.341 --> 00:00:19.372
One, small-scale family farmers
need more food.

00:00:19.738 --> 00:00:24.916
It's crazy that in 2019
farmers that feed us are hungry.

00:00:25.353 --> 00:00:30.186
And two, science needs to be
more diverse and inclusive.

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.101
If we're going to solve
the toughest challenges on the planet,

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:38.458
like food insecurity for the millions
living in extreme poverty,

00:00:38.482 --> 00:00:40.101
it's going to take all of us.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.260
I want to use the latest technology

00:00:43.284 --> 00:00:46.577
with the most diverse
and inclusive teams on the planet

00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:48.668
to help farmers have more food.

00:00:49.545 --> 00:00:51.426
I'm a computational biologist.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.854
I know -- what is that
and how is it going to help end hunger?

00:00:54.878 --> 00:00:58.124
Basically, I like computers and biology

00:00:58.148 --> 00:01:00.592
and somehow,
putting that together is a job.

00:01:00.616 --> 00:01:01.699
(Laughter)

00:01:01.723 --> 00:01:03.243
I don't have a story

00:01:03.267 --> 00:01:06.553
of wanting to be a biologist
from a young age.

00:01:06.577 --> 00:01:10.283
The truth is, I played
basketball in college.

00:01:10.585 --> 00:01:15.728
And part of my financial aid package
was I needed a work-study job.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.840
So one random day,

00:01:17.864 --> 00:01:21.061
I wandered to the nearest building
to my dorm room.

00:01:21.085 --> 00:01:23.765
And it just so happens
it was the biology building.

00:01:24.347 --> 00:01:26.933
I went inside and looked at the job board.

00:01:27.493 --> 00:01:29.657
Yes, this is pre-the-internet.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.437
And I saw a three-by-five card

00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:35.616
advertising a job
to work in the herbarium.

00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:38.602
I quickly took down the number,

00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:40.331
because it said "flexible hours,"

00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:43.612
and I needed that to work around
my basketball schedule.

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:48.791
I ran to the library
to figure out what an herbarium was.

00:01:48.815 --> 00:01:51.022
(Laughter)

00:01:51.046 --> 00:01:52.355
And it turns out

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:56.458
an herbarium is where they store
dead, dried plants.

00:01:57.379 --> 00:01:59.093
I was lucky to land the job.

00:01:59.117 --> 00:02:02.323
So my first scientific job

00:02:02.347 --> 00:02:07.682
was gluing dead plants onto paper
for hours on end.

00:02:07.706 --> 00:02:10.984
(Laughter)

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:12.158
It's so glamorous.

00:02:12.182 --> 00:02:15.321
This is how I became
a computational biologist.

00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:17.506
During that time,

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.252
genomics and computing were coming of age.

00:02:20.276 --> 00:02:22.680
And I went on to do my masters

00:02:22.704 --> 00:02:25.799
combining biology and computers.

00:02:25.823 --> 00:02:26.988
During that time,

00:02:27.012 --> 00:02:28.791
I worked at Los Alamos National Lab

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:31.333
in the theoretical biology
and biophysics group.

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:35.506
And it was there I had my first encounter
with the supercomputer,

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.204
and my mind was blown.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.879
With the power of supercomputing,

00:02:39.903 --> 00:02:44.126
which is basically thousands
of connected PCs on steroids,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.623
we were able to uncover the complexities
of influenza and hepatitis C.

00:02:50.134 --> 00:02:52.465
And it was during this time
that I saw the power

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.609
of using computers
and biology combined, for humanity.

00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:59.005
And I wanted this to be my career path.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.807
So, since 1999,

00:03:01.831 --> 00:03:04.529
I've spent the majority
of my scientific career

00:03:04.553 --> 00:03:06.482
in very high-tech labs,

00:03:06.506 --> 00:03:09.239
surrounded by really expensive equipment.

00:03:09.712 --> 00:03:11.355
So many ask me

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.246
how and why do I work
for farmers in Africa.

00:03:15.804 --> 00:03:18.106
Well, because of my computing skills,

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.669
in 2013, a team of East African scientists

00:03:22.693 --> 00:03:26.782
asked me to join the team
in the plight to save cassava.

00:03:27.766 --> 00:03:34.736
Cassava is a plant whose leaves and roots
feed 800 million people globally.

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.676
And 500 million in East Africa.

00:03:38.994 --> 00:03:41.001
So that's nearly a billion people

00:03:41.025 --> 00:03:43.993
relying on this plant
for their daily calories.

00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:48.426
If a small-scale family farmer
has enough cassava,

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.594
she can feed her family

00:03:50.618 --> 00:03:54.664
and she can sell it at the market
for important things like school fees,

00:03:54.688 --> 00:03:56.823
medical expenses and savings.

00:03:57.752 --> 00:04:01.283
But cassava is under attack in Africa.

00:04:01.665 --> 00:04:06.101
Whiteflies and viruses
are devastating cassava.

00:04:06.593 --> 00:04:08.799
Whiteflies are tiny insects

00:04:08.823 --> 00:04:11.641
that feed on the leaves
of over 600 plants.

00:04:11.665 --> 00:04:13.466
They are bad news.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:14.649
There are many species;

00:04:14.673 --> 00:04:16.942
they become pesticide resistant;

00:04:16.966 --> 00:04:21.220
and they transmit hundreds
of plant viruses

00:04:21.244 --> 00:04:23.768
that cause cassava brown streak disease

00:04:23.792 --> 00:04:25.592
and cassava mosaic disease.

00:04:26.085 --> 00:04:28.219
This completely kills the plant.

00:04:29.038 --> 00:04:30.855
And if there's no cassava,

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:34.878
there's no food or income
for millions of people.

00:04:36.141 --> 00:04:38.617
It took me one trip to Tanzania

00:04:38.641 --> 00:04:41.379
to realize that these women
need some help.

00:04:41.403 --> 00:04:45.656
These amazing, strong,
small-scale family farmers,

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.948
the majority women,

00:04:46.972 --> 00:04:48.239
are doing it rough.

00:04:48.744 --> 00:04:51.180
They don't have enough food
to feed their families,

00:04:51.204 --> 00:04:52.792
and it's a real crisis.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.029
What happens is

00:04:55.053 --> 00:04:58.045
they go out and plant fields of cassava
when the rains come.

00:04:58.069 --> 00:04:59.775
Nine months later,

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:02.879
there's nothing, because of these
pests and pathogens.

00:05:02.903 --> 00:05:05.061
And I thought to myself,

00:05:05.085 --> 00:05:08.283
how in the world can farmers be hungry?

00:05:08.815 --> 00:05:11.135
So I decided to spend
some time on the ground

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:12.839
with the farmers and the scientists

00:05:12.863 --> 00:05:15.466
to see if I had any skills
that could be helpful.

00:05:16.427 --> 00:05:19.283
The situation on the ground is shocking.

00:05:19.307 --> 00:05:23.577
The whiteflies have destroyed the leaves
that are eaten for protein,

00:05:23.601 --> 00:05:27.183
and the viruses have destroyed the roots
that are eaten for starch.

00:05:27.592 --> 00:05:30.037
An entire growing season will pass,

00:05:30.061 --> 00:05:34.171
and the farmer will lose
an entire year of income and food,

00:05:34.195 --> 00:05:37.393
and the family will suffer
a long hunger season.

00:05:37.942 --> 00:05:40.022
This is completely preventable.

00:05:40.046 --> 00:05:41.370
If the farmer knew

00:05:41.394 --> 00:05:44.458
what variety of cassava
to plant in her field,

00:05:44.482 --> 00:05:48.807
that was resistant
to those viruses and pathogens,

00:05:48.831 --> 00:05:50.736
they would have more food.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.595
We have all the technology we need,

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:56.823
but the knowledge and the resources

00:05:56.847 --> 00:05:59.982
are not equally distributed
around the globe.

00:06:00.712 --> 00:06:03.274
So what I mean specifically is,

00:06:03.298 --> 00:06:05.150
the older genomic technologies

00:06:05.174 --> 00:06:08.037
that have been required
to uncover the complexities

00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:11.123
in these pests and pathogens --

00:06:11.147 --> 00:06:14.145
these technologies were not made
for sub-Saharan Africa.

00:06:15.058 --> 00:06:17.399
They cost upwards of a million dollars;

00:06:17.423 --> 00:06:19.311
they require constant power

00:06:19.335 --> 00:06:21.135
and specialized human capacity.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.831
These machines are few
and far between on the continent,

00:06:24.855 --> 00:06:29.476
which is leaving many scientists
battling on the front lines no choice

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.499
but to send the samples overseas.

00:06:31.523 --> 00:06:33.483
And when you send the samples overseas,

00:06:33.507 --> 00:06:36.133
samples degrade, it costs a lot of money,

00:06:36.157 --> 00:06:39.324
and trying to get the data back
over weak internet

00:06:39.348 --> 00:06:40.748
is nearly impossible.

00:06:41.142 --> 00:06:45.441
So sometimes it can take six months
to get the results back to the farmer.

00:06:45.465 --> 00:06:47.219
And by then, it's too late.

00:06:47.243 --> 00:06:48.830
The crop is already gone,

00:06:48.854 --> 00:06:52.020
which results in further poverty
and more hunger.

00:06:53.306 --> 00:06:55.464
We knew we could fix this.

00:06:55.989 --> 00:06:57.393
In 2017,

00:06:57.417 --> 00:07:02.203
we had heard of this handheld,
portable DNA sequencer

00:07:02.227 --> 00:07:04.736
called an Oxford Nanopore MinION.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.913
This was being used
in West Africa to fight Ebola.

00:07:08.937 --> 00:07:10.434
So we thought:

00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:13.744
Why can't we use this
in East Africa to help farmers?

00:07:13.768 --> 00:07:18.101
So, what we did was we set out to do that.

00:07:18.609 --> 00:07:21.307
At the time, the technology was very new,

00:07:21.331 --> 00:07:24.283
and many doubted we could
replicate this on the farm.

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:26.196
When we set out to do this,

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:30.101
one of our "collaborators" in the UK

00:07:30.125 --> 00:07:33.752
told us that we would never
get that to work in East Africa,

00:07:33.776 --> 00:07:35.242
let alone on the farm.

00:07:35.863 --> 00:07:37.632
So we accepted the challenge.

00:07:37.934 --> 00:07:44.387
This person even went so far as to bet us
two of the best bottles of champagne

00:07:44.411 --> 00:07:47.369
that we would never get that to work.

00:07:48.871 --> 00:07:50.450
Two words:

00:07:50.474 --> 00:07:51.625
pay up.

00:07:51.649 --> 00:07:53.823
(Laughter)

00:07:53.847 --> 00:07:57.999
(Applause)

00:07:58.023 --> 00:08:00.936
Pay up, because we did it.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.245
We took the entire high-tech molecular lab

00:08:04.269 --> 00:08:07.918
to the farmers of Tanzania,
Kenya and Uganda,

00:08:07.942 --> 00:08:09.974
and we called it Tree Lab.

00:08:10.942 --> 00:08:12.133
So what did we do?

00:08:12.157 --> 00:08:14.736
Well, first of all,
we gave ourselves a team name --

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.934
it's called the Cassava Virus
Action Project.

00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:18.315
We made a website,

00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:21.950
we gathered support from the genomics
and computing communities,

00:08:21.974 --> 00:08:23.855
and away we went to the farmers.

00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:27.220
Everything that we need for our Tree Lab

00:08:27.244 --> 00:08:29.653
is being carried by the team here.

00:08:29.677 --> 00:08:33.724
All of the molecular and computational
requirements needed

00:08:33.748 --> 00:08:37.049
to diagnose sick plants is there.

00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:40.259
And it's actually all
on this stage here as well.

00:08:41.161 --> 00:08:44.748
We figured if we could get the data
closer to the problem,

00:08:44.772 --> 00:08:46.390
and closer to the farmer,

00:08:46.414 --> 00:08:49.770
the quicker we could tell her
what was wrong with her plant.

00:08:50.169 --> 00:08:52.042
And not only tell her what was wrong --

00:08:52.066 --> 00:08:53.458
give her the solution.

00:08:53.482 --> 00:08:54.807
And the solution is,

00:08:54.831 --> 00:08:57.454
burn the field and plant varieties

00:08:57.478 --> 00:09:00.982
that are resistant to the pests
and pathogens she has in her field.

00:09:01.942 --> 00:09:06.146
So the first thing that we did
was we had to do a DNA extraction.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.709
And we used this machine here.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:12.249
It's called a PDQeX,

00:09:12.273 --> 00:09:16.164
which stands for
"Pretty Damn Quick Extraction."

00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:18.236
(Laughter)

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.410
I know.

00:09:19.768 --> 00:09:22.262
My friend Joe is really cool.

00:09:23.394 --> 00:09:26.754
One of the biggest challenges
in doing a DNA extraction

00:09:26.778 --> 00:09:30.093
is it usually requires
very expensive equipment,

00:09:30.117 --> 00:09:31.521
and takes hours.

00:09:31.545 --> 00:09:33.037
But with this machine,

00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:35.815
we've been able to do it in 20 minutes,

00:09:35.839 --> 00:09:37.085
at a fraction of the cost.

00:09:37.109 --> 00:09:39.997
And this runs off of a motorcycle battery.

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:46.307
From there, we take the DNA extraction
and prepare it into a library,

00:09:46.331 --> 00:09:48.110
getting it ready to load on

00:09:48.134 --> 00:09:52.426
to this portable, handheld
genomic sequencer,

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.601
which is here,

00:09:53.625 --> 00:09:57.363
and then we plug this
into a mini supercomputer,

00:09:57.387 --> 00:09:59.209
which is called a MinIT.

00:09:59.728 --> 00:10:03.830
And both of these things are plugged
into a portable battery pack.

00:10:04.569 --> 00:10:06.442
So we were able to eliminate

00:10:06.466 --> 00:10:08.871
the requirements
of main power and internet,

00:10:08.895 --> 00:10:12.823
which are two very limiting factors
on a small-scale family farm.

00:10:13.807 --> 00:10:16.678
Analyzing the data quickly
can also be a problem.

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:20.939
But this is where me being
a computational biologist came in handy.

00:10:21.382 --> 00:10:23.612
All that gluing of dead plants,

00:10:23.636 --> 00:10:25.196
and all that measuring,

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.212
and all that computing

00:10:27.236 --> 00:10:31.387
finally came in handy
in a real-world, real-time way.

00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:34.464
I was able to make customized databases

00:10:34.488 --> 00:10:39.083
and we were able to give the farmers
results in three hours

00:10:39.107 --> 00:10:40.971
versus six months.

00:10:41.694 --> 00:10:48.662
(Applause)

00:10:50.085 --> 00:10:52.719
The farmers were overjoyed.

00:10:53.799 --> 00:10:56.595
So how do we know
that we're having impact?

00:10:56.619 --> 00:10:58.619
Nine moths after our Tree Lab,

00:10:58.643 --> 00:11:01.873
Asha went from having
zero tons per hectare

00:11:01.897 --> 00:11:03.905
to 40 tons per hectare.

00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:05.728
She had enough to feed her family

00:11:05.752 --> 00:11:08.442
and she was selling it at the market,

00:11:08.466 --> 00:11:11.201
and she's now building a house
for her family.

00:11:12.212 --> 00:11:13.371
Yeah, so cool.

00:11:13.395 --> 00:11:17.649
(Applause)

00:11:17.673 --> 00:11:19.539
So how do we scale Tree Lab?

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.320
The thing is,

00:11:21.344 --> 00:11:23.447
farmers are scaled already in Africa.

00:11:23.471 --> 00:11:25.360
These women work in farmer groups,

00:11:25.384 --> 00:11:29.510
so helping Asha actually helped
3,000 people in her village,

00:11:29.534 --> 00:11:33.186
because she shared the results
and also the solution.

00:11:33.673 --> 00:11:37.864
I remember every single
farmer I've ever met.

00:11:38.665 --> 00:11:42.228
Their pain and their joy

00:11:42.252 --> 00:11:44.052
is engraved in my memories.

00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:46.823
Our science is for them.

00:11:47.711 --> 00:11:52.758
Tree Lab is our best attempt
to help them become more food secure.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.966
I never dreamt

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.934
that the best science
I would ever do in my life

00:11:57.958 --> 00:12:01.457
would be on that blanket in East Africa,

00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:03.847
with the highest-tech genomic gadgets.

00:12:04.312 --> 00:12:06.764
But our team did dream

00:12:06.788 --> 00:12:11.058
that we could give farmers answers
in three hours versus six months,

00:12:11.082 --> 00:12:12.518
and then we did it.

00:12:12.542 --> 00:12:16.650
Because that's the power
of diversity and inclusion in science.

00:12:17.156 --> 00:12:18.307
Thank you.

00:12:18.331 --> 00:12:21.482
(Applause)

00:12:21.506 --> 00:12:25.589
(Cheers)
