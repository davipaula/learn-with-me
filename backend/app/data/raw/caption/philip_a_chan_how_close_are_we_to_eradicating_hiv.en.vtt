00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:08.342
The world is getting closer

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:12.772
to achieving one of the most important 
public health goals of our time:

00:00:12.772 --> 00:00:15.062
eradicating HIV.

00:00:15.062 --> 00:00:18.292
And to do this, we won’t even have 
to cure the disease.

00:00:18.292 --> 00:00:21.722
We simply have to stop HIV from 
being transmitted

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:24.392
until eventually it fizzles out.

00:00:24.392 --> 00:00:27.072
Once, this goal would have 
seemed impossible.

00:00:27.072 --> 00:00:29.832
HIV has caused millions of deaths

00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:34.182
and is one of the most devastating 
diseases that humanity has ever known.

00:00:34.182 --> 00:00:36.730
But we’re now at a point where new 
advances

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.490
such as one-pill, once-a-day medications

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.320
are helping us tackle HIV 
in effective ways.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.730
HIV is a retrovirus–

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.300
meaning it integrates copies of itself 
into an infected cell’s DNA,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.575
allowing it to replicate and 
infect other cells.

00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:57.945
HIV has evolved numerous ways to evade 
the human immune system,

00:00:57.945 --> 00:01:00.295
which makes it difficult to cure.

00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:03.845
But by developing ways to 
block HIV replication,

00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:06.745
we can stop the spread of HIV itself.

00:01:06.745 --> 00:01:12.465
That’s where antiretrovirals–
a.k.a. ARVs– come in.

00:01:12.465 --> 00:01:17.405
ARVs are a group of drugs which work 
in different ways to combat HIV.

00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:20.425
Some block HIV’s access into immune cells,

00:01:20.425 --> 00:01:24.955
and others work by stopping the 
virus itself from replicating.

00:01:24.955 --> 00:01:30.444
ARVs also work preventatively in people 
who don’t have HIV.

00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:35.364
This type of approach is called 
pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP.

00:01:35.364 --> 00:01:38.432
PrEP works by accumulating in a 
person’s body

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:41.682
and preventing HIV from 
establishing itself.

00:01:41.682 --> 00:01:46.362
That means an HIV-negative person who may
be at risk of contracting the disease

00:01:46.362 --> 00:01:49.156
can take certain ARVs 
to protect themselves,

00:01:49.156 --> 00:01:51.456
before they become exposed.

00:01:51.456 --> 00:01:53.836
Here’s where it gets 
especially interesting:

00:01:53.836 --> 00:01:59.906
In people with HIV, ARVs can also 
dramatically reduce HIV transmission.

00:01:59.906 --> 00:02:02.866
This is called “Treatment as Prevention.”

00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:07.886
On a global scale, this has the potential 
to end the HIV epidemic.

00:02:07.886 --> 00:02:12.044
It’s based on the idea that someone with
HIV who takes ARV’s

00:02:12.044 --> 00:02:16.774
can lower the virus level in their bodies
until it becomes undetectable.

00:02:16.774 --> 00:02:18.990
That doesn’t mean the virus is gone;

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.350
it could still be lurking within cells, 
ready to reactivate if treatment stops.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.305
But so long as it’s kept 
dormant with drugs,

00:02:27.305 --> 00:02:29.445
HIV remains undetectable.

00:02:29.445 --> 00:02:33.965
And when HIV is undetectable, 
it’s untransmittable, too.

00:02:33.965 --> 00:02:38.410
In theory this means that by testing 
everyone who’s at risk of HIV

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.434
and treating those who test positive,

00:02:40.434 --> 00:02:44.564
we could stop transmission and 
eventually eradicate HIV.

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:48.228
In the real world, however, 
things are more complex.

00:02:48.228 --> 00:02:52.098
Many at-risk HIV negative people across 
the world

00:02:52.098 --> 00:02:55.188
do not have access to PrEP or ARVs,

00:02:55.188 --> 00:03:00.608
and those who are HIV positive may 
experience challenges to taking ARVs.

00:03:00.608 --> 00:03:03.098
These problems are often greatest in 
countries

00:03:03.098 --> 00:03:06.628
where the burden of HIV is highest.

00:03:06.628 --> 00:03:10.778
Getting these medications depends on 
access to a functioning healthcare system–

00:03:10.778 --> 00:03:13.294
and this isn’t something everyone has.

00:03:13.294 --> 00:03:16.724
That’s part of the reason why stopping 
the spread of HIV for good

00:03:16.724 --> 00:03:22.514
will require a significant investment of 
resources to improve those systems.

00:03:22.514 --> 00:03:24.804
One study carried out by the UNAIDS

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:28.804
estimated that between 20-30 billion 
dollars per year

00:03:28.804 --> 00:03:32.231
would be needed to achieve 
a nearly 90% reduction

00:03:32.231 --> 00:03:35.761
in new HIV infections by 2030.

00:03:35.761 --> 00:03:40.181
This investment would ensure more people
would get tested in the first place,

00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:44.181
and more would be able to access and 
maintain treatment.

00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:47.499
Achieving this goal and improving 
healthcare in general

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:49.169
is in everyone’s best interest,

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:52.659
from individual people to 
society as a whole.

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.589
We have roadmaps that could allow us

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:58.469
to bring the HIV epidemic to an 
end in the near future,

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:01.739
with the possibility of eradicating the 
disease altogether

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.269
several generations in the future.

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.749
In the period from 1996 to 2017

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:11.549
we almost halved the number 
of new HIV infections,

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.649
and for the millions of people who still 
live with the virus,

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:19.069
ARV treatments enable most to lead long 
and healthy lives.

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:21.421
With continued and increased investments,

00:04:21.421 --> 00:04:25.681
we can get transmission rates low enough
to end HIV once and for all.

00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:29.601
A world without HIV is no longer 
inconceivable:

00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:31.291
it’s closer than ever.
