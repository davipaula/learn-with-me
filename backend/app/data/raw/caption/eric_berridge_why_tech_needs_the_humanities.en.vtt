00:00:12.647 --> 00:00:14.889
You've all been in a bar, right?

00:00:14.913 --> 00:00:16.404
(Laughter)

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.453
But have you ever gone to a bar

00:00:19.477 --> 00:00:22.429
and come out with a $200 million business?

00:00:24.276 --> 00:00:26.556
That's what happened to us
about 10 years ago.

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:29.150
We'd had a terrible day.

00:00:30.012 --> 00:00:34.076
We had this huge client
that was killing us.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.704
We're a software consulting firm,

00:00:36.728 --> 00:00:39.710
and we couldn't find
a very specific programming skill

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:42.892
to help this client deploy
a cutting-edge cloud system.

00:00:43.798 --> 00:00:45.219
We have a bunch of engineers,

00:00:45.243 --> 00:00:47.837
but none of them could please this client.

00:00:49.274 --> 00:00:50.931
And we were about to be fired.

00:00:51.888 --> 00:00:54.223
So we go out to the bar,

00:00:54.247 --> 00:00:58.294
and we're hanging out
with our bartender friend Jeff,

00:00:58.318 --> 00:01:00.319
and he's doing
what all good bartenders do:

00:01:00.343 --> 00:01:03.365
he's commiserating with us,
making us feel better,

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:05.681
relating to our pain,

00:01:05.705 --> 00:01:07.753
saying, "Hey, these guys
are overblowing it.

00:01:07.777 --> 00:01:08.960
Don't worry about it."

00:01:08.984 --> 00:01:11.198
And finally, he deadpans us and says,

00:01:11.222 --> 00:01:13.515
"Why don't you send me in there?

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.046
I can figure it out."

00:01:15.585 --> 00:01:18.666
So the next morning,
we're hanging out in our team meeting,

00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:22.456
and we're all a little hazy ...

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.630
(Laughter)

00:01:24.504 --> 00:01:26.624
and I half-jokingly throw it out there.

00:01:26.648 --> 00:01:29.232
I say, "Hey, I mean,
we're about to be fired."

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:30.558
So I say,

00:01:30.582 --> 00:01:32.664
"Why don't we send in
Jeff, the bartender?"

00:01:32.688 --> 00:01:35.765
(Laughter)

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.850
And there's some silence,
some quizzical looks.

00:01:39.874 --> 00:01:43.416
Finally, my chief of staff says,
"That is a great idea."

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.177
(Laughter)

00:01:45.201 --> 00:01:47.295
"Jeff is wicked smart. He's brilliant.

00:01:48.168 --> 00:01:49.318
He'll figure it out.

00:01:50.328 --> 00:01:51.741
Let's send him in there."

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.715
Now, Jeff was not a programmer.

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:58.628
In fact, he had dropped out of Penn
as a philosophy major.

00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:01.485
But he was brilliant,

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.136
and he could go deep on topics,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.192
and we were about to be fired.

00:02:06.216 --> 00:02:07.366
So we sent him in.

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:11.825
After a couple days of suspense,

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.006
Jeff was still there.

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:17.142
They hadn't sent him home.

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:19.232
I couldn't believe it.

00:02:19.256 --> 00:02:20.747
What was he doing?

00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:22.431
Here's what I learned.

00:02:23.318 --> 00:02:27.528
He had completely disarmed
their fixation on the programming skill.

00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:31.925
And he had changed the conversation,

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:33.965
even changing what we were building.

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.541
The conversation was now
about what we were going to build and why.

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:46.417
And yes, Jeff figured out
how to program the solution,

00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:48.806
and the client became
one of our best references.

00:02:50.782 --> 00:02:52.759
Back then, we were 200 people,

00:02:52.783 --> 00:02:59.103
and half of our company was made up
of computer science majors or engineers,

00:02:59.127 --> 00:03:01.388
but our experience with Jeff
left us wondering:

00:03:02.627 --> 00:03:04.698
Could we repeat this through our business?

00:03:06.017 --> 00:03:10.278
So we changed the way
we recruited and trained.

00:03:11.766 --> 00:03:17.750
And while we still sought after computer
engineers and computer science majors,

00:03:17.774 --> 00:03:22.750
we sprinkled in artists,
musicians, writers ...

00:03:24.818 --> 00:03:29.192
and Jeff's story started to multiply
itself throughout our company.

00:03:29.216 --> 00:03:32.549
Our chief technology officer
is an English major,

00:03:34.168 --> 00:03:36.382
and he was a bike messenger in Manhattan.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.626
And today, we're a thousand people,

00:03:41.935 --> 00:03:47.387
yet still less than a hundred have degrees
in computer science or engineering.

00:03:48.984 --> 00:03:52.167
And yes, we're still
a computer consulting firm.

00:03:52.191 --> 00:03:54.317
We're the number one player in our market.

00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:56.694
We work with the fastest-growing
software package

00:03:56.718 --> 00:03:59.011
to ever reach 10 billion dollars
in annual sales.

00:04:01.015 --> 00:04:02.641
So it's working.

00:04:05.426 --> 00:04:11.157
Meanwhile, the push for STEM-based
education in this country --

00:04:11.181 --> 00:04:14.515
science, technology,
engineering, mathematics --

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:15.751
is fierce.

00:04:15.775 --> 00:04:17.655
It's in all of our faces.

00:04:18.355 --> 00:04:20.029
And this is a colossal mistake.

00:04:21.707 --> 00:04:25.936
Since 2009, STEM majors
in the United States

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.016
have increased by 43 percent,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.468
while the humanities have stayed flat.

00:04:30.492 --> 00:04:31.857
Our past president

00:04:33.047 --> 00:04:36.550
dedicated over a billion dollars
towards STEM education

00:04:36.574 --> 00:04:39.413
at the expense of other subjects,

00:04:39.437 --> 00:04:42.313
and our current president

00:04:42.337 --> 00:04:47.204
recently redirected 200 million dollars
of Department of Education funding

00:04:47.228 --> 00:04:48.697
into computer science.

00:04:49.788 --> 00:04:56.169
And CEOs are continually complaining
about an engineering-starved workforce.

00:04:57.717 --> 00:04:59.162
These campaigns,

00:05:00.583 --> 00:05:04.131
coupled with the undeniable success
of the tech economy --

00:05:04.155 --> 00:05:05.403
I mean, let's face it,

00:05:05.427 --> 00:05:10.935
seven out of the 10 most valuable
companies in the world by market cap

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:12.470
are technology firms --

00:05:13.662 --> 00:05:15.638
these things create an assumption

00:05:16.805 --> 00:05:21.019
that the path of our future workforce
will be dominated by STEM.

00:05:24.583 --> 00:05:25.733
I get it.

00:05:26.692 --> 00:05:28.313
On paper, it makes sense.

00:05:29.498 --> 00:05:30.710
It's tempting.

00:05:33.597 --> 00:05:35.530
But it's totally overblown.

00:05:35.554 --> 00:05:41.605
It's like, the entire soccer team
chases the ball into the corner,

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:43.407
because that's where the ball is.

00:05:44.841 --> 00:05:47.087
We shouldn't overvalue STEM.

00:05:48.133 --> 00:05:51.706
We shouldn't value the sciences
any more than we value the humanities.

00:05:52.544 --> 00:05:54.266
And there are a couple of reasons.

00:05:55.058 --> 00:06:01.044
Number one, today's technologies
are incredibly intuitive.

00:06:01.068 --> 00:06:05.068
The reason we've been able
to recruit from all disciplines

00:06:05.092 --> 00:06:07.211
and swivel into specialized skills

00:06:08.377 --> 00:06:13.131
is because modern systems
can be manipulated without writing code.

00:06:13.155 --> 00:06:19.009
They're like LEGO: easy to put together,
easy to learn, even easy to program,

00:06:19.033 --> 00:06:22.524
given the vast amounts of information
that are available for learning.

00:06:23.173 --> 00:06:26.008
Yes, our workforce
needs specialized skill,

00:06:27.242 --> 00:06:32.036
but that skill requires a far less
rigorous and formalized education

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.916
than it did in the past.

00:06:34.876 --> 00:06:40.615
Number two, the skills
that are imperative and differentiated

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:43.788
in a world with intuitive technology

00:06:43.812 --> 00:06:47.399
are the skills that help us
to work together as humans,

00:06:49.184 --> 00:06:53.168
where the hard work
is envisioning the end product

00:06:54.193 --> 00:06:55.685
and its usefulness,

00:06:55.709 --> 00:07:01.923
which requires real-world experience
and judgment and historical context.

00:07:03.232 --> 00:07:05.518
What Jeff's story taught us

00:07:05.542 --> 00:07:09.073
is that the customer
was focused on the wrong thing.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.667
It's the classic case:

00:07:12.661 --> 00:07:16.923
the technologist struggling to communicate
with the business and the end user,

00:07:16.947 --> 00:07:21.133
and the business failing
to articulate their needs.

00:07:22.033 --> 00:07:23.739
I see it every day.

00:07:25.448 --> 00:07:27.370
We are scratching the surface

00:07:27.394 --> 00:07:32.203
in our ability as humans
to communicate and invent together,

00:07:32.227 --> 00:07:36.807
and while the sciences teach us
how to build things,

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:42.241
it's the humanities that teach us
what to build and why to build them.

00:07:43.612 --> 00:07:46.216
And they're equally as important,

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.747
and they're just as hard.

00:07:50.476 --> 00:07:52.471
It irks me ...

00:07:54.532 --> 00:08:00.025
when I hear people
treat the humanities as a lesser path,

00:08:00.049 --> 00:08:01.233
as the easier path.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.990
Come on!

00:08:04.258 --> 00:08:08.408
The humanities give us
the context of our world.

00:08:10.573 --> 00:08:14.010
They teach us how to think critically.

00:08:14.034 --> 00:08:16.003
They are purposely unstructured,

00:08:16.027 --> 00:08:18.573
while the sciences
are purposely structured.

00:08:19.745 --> 00:08:23.333
They teach us to persuade,
they give us our language,

00:08:23.357 --> 00:08:30.196
which we use to convert our emotions
to thought and action.

00:08:32.267 --> 00:08:36.531
And they need to be
on equal footing with the sciences.

00:08:36.555 --> 00:08:40.547
And yes, you can hire a bunch of artists

00:08:40.571 --> 00:08:41.904
and build a tech company

00:08:43.166 --> 00:08:44.936
and have an incredible outcome.

00:08:46.616 --> 00:08:51.338
Now, I'm not here today
to tell you that STEM's bad.

00:08:52.778 --> 00:08:56.762
I'm not here today
to tell you that girls shouldn't code.

00:08:57.111 --> 00:08:58.150
(Laughter)

00:08:58.174 --> 00:08:59.324
Please.

00:09:00.355 --> 00:09:02.923
And that next bridge I drive over

00:09:02.947 --> 00:09:06.497
or that next elevator we all jump into --

00:09:07.602 --> 00:09:09.809
let's make sure
there's an engineer behind it.

00:09:09.833 --> 00:09:13.475
(Laughter)

00:09:14.233 --> 00:09:17.528
But to fall into this paranoia

00:09:17.552 --> 00:09:22.424
that our future jobs
will be dominated by STEM,

00:09:22.448 --> 00:09:24.083
that's just folly.

00:09:24.526 --> 00:09:28.617
If you have friends or kids
or relatives or grandchildren

00:09:28.641 --> 00:09:30.440
or nieces or nephews ...

00:09:30.464 --> 00:09:33.614
encourage them to be
whatever they want to be.

00:09:34.336 --> 00:09:41.232
(Applause)

00:09:41.607 --> 00:09:43.622
The jobs will be there.

00:09:45.741 --> 00:09:47.218
Those tech CEOs

00:09:48.235 --> 00:09:51.569
that are clamoring for STEM grads,

00:09:51.593 --> 00:09:53.377
you know what they're hiring for?

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.455
Google, Apple, Facebook.

00:09:57.468 --> 00:10:01.095
Sixty-five percent
of their open job opportunities

00:10:01.119 --> 00:10:02.840
are non-technical:

00:10:03.845 --> 00:10:08.734
marketers, designers,
project managers, program managers,

00:10:08.758 --> 00:10:12.139
product managers, lawyers, HR specialists,

00:10:12.163 --> 00:10:15.488
trainers, coaches, sellers,
buyers, on and on.

00:10:15.512 --> 00:10:18.950
These are the jobs they're hiring for.

00:10:20.602 --> 00:10:26.007
And if there's one thing
that our future workforce needs --

00:10:26.031 --> 00:10:27.983
and I think we can all agree on this --

00:10:29.056 --> 00:10:30.206
it's diversity.

00:10:31.706 --> 00:10:35.780
But that diversity shouldn't end
with gender or race.

00:10:35.804 --> 00:10:37.907
We need a diversity of backgrounds

00:10:39.192 --> 00:10:40.342
and skills,

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.838
with introverts and extroverts

00:10:45.862 --> 00:10:48.815
and leaders and followers.

00:10:48.839 --> 00:10:50.528
That is our future workforce.

00:10:51.767 --> 00:10:57.466
And the fact that the technology
is getting easier and more accessible

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.308
frees that workforce up

00:10:59.332 --> 00:11:02.704
to study whatever they damn well please.

00:11:03.273 --> 00:11:04.424
Thank you.

00:11:04.448 --> 00:11:11.071
(Applause)
