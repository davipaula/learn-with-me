00:00:13.953 --> 00:00:18.359
The most astounding place I've ever been
is the Mosquitia Rain Forest in Honduras.

00:00:19.268 --> 00:00:21.840
I've done archaeological fieldwork
all over the world,

00:00:21.864 --> 00:00:24.951
so I thought I knew what to expect
venturing into the jungle,

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:26.416
but I was wrong.

00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:29.053
For the first time
in my life, I might add.

00:00:29.635 --> 00:00:31.386
(Laughter)

00:00:32.172 --> 00:00:34.335
First of all, it's freezing.

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:37.668
It's 90 degrees, but you're
soaking wet from the humidity,

00:00:37.692 --> 00:00:42.235
and the canopy of trees is so thick
that sunlight never reaches the surface.

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:44.010
You can't get dry.

00:00:44.034 --> 00:00:47.488
Immediately, I knew that
I hadn't brought enough clothing.

00:00:48.507 --> 00:00:53.039
That first night, I kept feeling things
moving underneath my hammock,

00:00:53.063 --> 00:00:57.579
unknown creatures brushing and poking
against the thin nylon fabric.

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:01.185
And I could barely sleep
through all the noise.

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:03.444
The jungle is loud. It's shockingly loud.

00:01:03.468 --> 00:01:06.242
It's like being downtown
in a bustling city.

00:01:07.035 --> 00:01:08.277
As the night wore on,

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:11.781
I became increasingly frustrated
with my sleeplessness,

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:13.666
knowing I had a full day ahead.

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:16.614
When I finally got up at dawn,

00:01:16.638 --> 00:01:19.287
my sense of unseen things
was all too real.

00:01:19.772 --> 00:01:21.817
There were hoofprints, paw prints,

00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:24.823
linear snake tracks everywhere.

00:01:25.308 --> 00:01:27.577
And what's even more shocking,

00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:29.863
we saw those same animals in the daylight,

00:01:29.887 --> 00:01:32.189
and they were completely unafraid of us.

00:01:32.688 --> 00:01:35.300
They had no experience with people.

00:01:35.324 --> 00:01:37.503
They had no reason to be afraid.

00:01:38.757 --> 00:01:42.880
As I walked toward the undocumented city,
my reason for being there,

00:01:42.904 --> 00:01:46.318
I realized that this was the only place
that I had ever been

00:01:46.342 --> 00:01:48.815
where I didn't see
a single shred of plastic.

00:01:49.467 --> 00:01:51.331
That's how remote it was.

00:01:52.371 --> 00:01:54.204
Perhaps it's surprising to learn

00:01:54.228 --> 00:01:59.059
that there are still places on our planet
that are so untouched by people,

00:01:59.083 --> 00:02:00.329
but it's true.

00:02:00.892 --> 00:02:05.130
There are still hundreds of places
where people haven't stepped for centuries

00:02:05.154 --> 00:02:06.615
or maybe forever.

00:02:08.892 --> 00:02:12.070
It's an awesome time
to be an archaeologist.

00:02:12.094 --> 00:02:14.809
We have the tools and the technology

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:17.740
to understand our planet
like never before.

00:02:18.355 --> 00:02:20.263
And yet, we're running out of time.

00:02:20.867 --> 00:02:26.753
The climate crisis threatens to destroy
our ecological and cultural patrimony.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.810
I feel an urgency to my work

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:32.037
that I didn't feel 20 years ago.

00:02:32.647 --> 00:02:35.875
How can we document everything
before it's too late?

00:02:37.462 --> 00:02:39.610
I was trained as
a traditional archaeologist

00:02:39.634 --> 00:02:42.940
using methodologies that
have been around since the '50s.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.709
That all changed in July of 2009

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:48.744
in Michoacán, Mexico.

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:51.104
I was studying the ancient
Purépecha Empire,

00:02:51.128 --> 00:02:54.229
which is a lesser known
but equally important contemporary

00:02:54.253 --> 00:02:55.519
of the Aztec.

00:02:55.924 --> 00:03:00.222
Two weeks earlier, my team
had documented an unknown settlement,

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:06.172
so we were painstakingly mapping,
building foundations by hand --

00:03:06.196 --> 00:03:07.666
hundreds of them.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.179
Basic archaeological protocol
is to find the edge of a settlement

00:03:12.203 --> 00:03:14.074
so you know what you're dealing with,

00:03:14.098 --> 00:03:17.216
and my graduate students
convinced me to do just that.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.092
So I grabbed a couple of CLIF Bars,
some water, a walkie,

00:03:22.116 --> 00:03:24.176
and I set out alone on foot,

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.732
expecting to encounter "the edge"
in just a few minutes.

00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:29.905
A few minutes passed.

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:31.503
And then an hour.

00:03:31.527 --> 00:03:34.005
Finally, I reached
the other side of the malpais.

00:03:34.483 --> 00:03:38.571
Oh, there were ancient
building foundations all the way across.

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:40.812
It's a city?

00:03:40.836 --> 00:03:42.209
Oh, shit.

00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:43.235
(Laughter)

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:44.444
It's a city.

00:03:45.605 --> 00:03:48.735
Turns out that this
seemingly small settlement

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:51.815
was actually an ancient urban megalopolis,

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:54.648
26 square kilometers in size,

00:03:54.672 --> 00:03:58.917
with as many building foundations
as modern-day Manhattan,

00:03:58.941 --> 00:04:01.801
an archaeological settlement so large

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:04.997
that it would take me
decades to survey fully,

00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:07.055
the entire rest of my career,

00:04:07.985 --> 00:04:13.329
which was exactly how I didn't want
to spend the entire rest of my career --

00:04:13.353 --> 00:04:14.964
(Laughter)

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:17.470
sweating, exhausted,

00:04:17.494 --> 00:04:20.481
placating stressed-out
graduate students --

00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:21.894
(Laughter)

00:04:21.918 --> 00:04:24.733
tossing scraps of PB and J sandwiches

00:04:24.757 --> 00:04:26.136
to feral dogs,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.008
which is pointless, by the way,

00:04:28.032 --> 00:04:31.235
because Mexican dogs
really don't like peanut butter.

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:32.910
(Laughter)

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.486
Just the thought of it bored me to tears.

00:04:38.065 --> 00:04:39.724
So I returned home to Colorado,

00:04:39.748 --> 00:04:42.328
and I poked my head
through a colleague's door.

00:04:42.352 --> 00:04:45.494
"Dude, there's gotta be a better way."

00:04:46.122 --> 00:04:49.059
He asked if I had heard
of this new technology called LiDAR --

00:04:49.083 --> 00:04:50.537
Light Detection And Ranging.

00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:51.926
I looked it up.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.293
LiDAR involves shooting
a dense grid of laser pulses

00:04:55.317 --> 00:04:58.122
from an airplane to the ground's surface.

00:04:58.146 --> 00:05:01.090
What you end up with
is a high-resolution scan

00:05:01.114 --> 00:05:03.238
of the earth's surface
and everything on it.

00:05:03.712 --> 00:05:05.214
It's not an image,

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:08.662
but instead it's a dense,
three-dimensional plot of points.

00:05:09.236 --> 00:05:11.541
We had enough money in the scan,

00:05:11.565 --> 00:05:13.327
so we did just that.

00:05:13.351 --> 00:05:14.888
The company went to Mexico,

00:05:14.912 --> 00:05:16.217
they flew the LiDAR

00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:17.886
and they sent back the data.

00:05:18.554 --> 00:05:22.733
Over the next several months, I learned
to practice digital deforestation,

00:05:22.757 --> 00:05:26.426
filtering away trees, brush
and other vegetation

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.557
to reveal the ancient
cultural landscape below.

00:05:30.338 --> 00:05:32.787
When I looked at my first visualization,

00:05:32.811 --> 00:05:34.087
I began to cry,

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.175
which I know comes
as quite a shock to you,

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.131
given how manly I must seem.

00:05:39.155 --> 00:05:40.993
(Laughter)

00:05:42.126 --> 00:05:44.316
In just 45 minutes of flying,

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.134
the LiDAR had collected
the same amount of data

00:05:47.158 --> 00:05:50.083
as what would have taken decades by hand:

00:05:50.107 --> 00:05:51.637
every house foundation,

00:05:51.661 --> 00:05:54.274
building, road and pyramid,

00:05:54.298 --> 00:05:56.330
incredible detail,

00:05:56.354 --> 00:05:59.600
representing the lives
of thousands of people

00:05:59.624 --> 00:06:02.809
who lived and loved and died
in these spaces.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.565
And what's more, the quality of the data

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:09.640
wasn't comparable to traditional
archaeological research.

00:06:10.442 --> 00:06:12.398
It was much, much better.

00:06:13.181 --> 00:06:17.446
I knew that this technology would change
the entire field of archaeology

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.099
in the coming years,

00:06:19.123 --> 00:06:20.424
and it did.

00:06:22.376 --> 00:06:25.432
Our work came to the attention
of a group of filmmakers

00:06:25.456 --> 00:06:28.361
who were searching for a legendary
lost city in Honduras.

00:06:28.965 --> 00:06:30.352
They failed in their quest,

00:06:30.376 --> 00:06:33.959
but they instead documented
an unknown culture,

00:06:33.983 --> 00:06:38.331
now buried under a pristine
wilderness rain forest,

00:06:38.355 --> 00:06:39.710
using LiDAR.

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:42.643
I agreed to help interpret their data,

00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:46.582
which is how I found myself deep
in that Mosquitia jungle,

00:06:46.606 --> 00:06:49.886
plastic-free and filled
with curious animals.

00:06:51.085 --> 00:06:54.150
Our goal was to verify
that the archaeological features

00:06:54.174 --> 00:06:56.113
we identified in our LiDAR

00:06:56.137 --> 00:06:57.904
were actually there on the ground,

00:06:57.928 --> 00:06:59.134
and they were.

00:07:00.871 --> 00:07:05.563
Eleven months later, I returned
with a crack team of archaeologists

00:07:05.587 --> 00:07:08.425
sponsored by the
National Geographic Society

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:09.932
and the Honduran government.

00:07:10.332 --> 00:07:13.639
In a month, we excavated over 400 objects

00:07:13.663 --> 00:07:16.549
from what we now call
the City of the Jaguar.

00:07:17.678 --> 00:07:22.843
We felt a moral and ethical responsibility
to protect this site as it was,

00:07:22.867 --> 00:07:25.088
but in the short time that we were there,

00:07:25.112 --> 00:07:27.037
things inevitably changed.

00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:31.841
The tiny gravel bar where we first
landed our helicopter was gone.

00:07:32.507 --> 00:07:35.273
The brush had been cleared away
and the trees removed

00:07:35.297 --> 00:07:39.083
to create a large landing zone
for several helicopters at once.

00:07:39.654 --> 00:07:40.818
Without it,

00:07:40.842 --> 00:07:43.164
after just one rainy season,

00:07:43.188 --> 00:07:46.553
the ancient canals that we
had seen in our LiDAR scan

00:07:46.577 --> 00:07:48.273
were damaged or destroyed.

00:07:48.942 --> 00:07:52.721
And the Eden I described
soon had a large clearing,

00:07:52.745 --> 00:07:54.096
central camp,

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.291
lights

00:07:55.315 --> 00:07:56.765
and an outdoor chapel.

00:07:57.494 --> 00:08:01.633
In other words, despite our best efforts
to protect the site as it was,

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:03.716
things changed.

00:08:04.335 --> 00:08:08.838
Our initial LiDAR scan
of this City of the Jaguar

00:08:08.862 --> 00:08:14.220
is the only record of this place
as it existed just a few years ago.

00:08:15.609 --> 00:08:17.055
And broadly speaking,

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:19.309
this is a problem for archaeologists.

00:08:19.758 --> 00:08:22.880
We can't study an area
without changing it somehow,

00:08:22.904 --> 00:08:25.954
and regardless, the earth is changing.

00:08:25.978 --> 00:08:28.325
Archaeological sites are destroyed.

00:08:28.924 --> 00:08:30.579
History is lost.

00:08:31.603 --> 00:08:34.075
Just this year, we watched in horror

00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:37.176
as the Notre Dame Cathedral
went up in flames.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.442
The iconic spire collapsed,

00:08:39.466 --> 00:08:41.365
and the roof was all but destroyed.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:46.294
Miraculously, the art historian
Andrew Tallon and colleagues

00:08:46.318 --> 00:08:49.200
scanned the cathedral in 2010 using LiDAR.

00:08:49.827 --> 00:08:53.791
At the time, their goal was to understand
how the building was constructed.

00:08:54.537 --> 00:08:59.222
Now, their LiDAR scan is the most
comprehensive record of the cathedral,

00:08:59.246 --> 00:09:01.960
and it'll prove invaluable
in the reconstruction.

00:09:03.095 --> 00:09:05.470
They couldn't have anticipated the fire

00:09:05.494 --> 00:09:07.549
or how their scan would be used,

00:09:07.573 --> 00:09:09.097
but we're lucky to have it.

00:09:09.902 --> 00:09:13.037
We take for granted that our cultural
and ecological patrimony

00:09:13.061 --> 00:09:14.367
will be around forever.

00:09:14.893 --> 00:09:16.094
It won't.

00:09:16.616 --> 00:09:19.715
Organizations like SCI-Arc
and Virtual Wonders

00:09:19.739 --> 00:09:21.985
are doing incredible work

00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:24.742
to record the world's historic monuments,

00:09:25.678 --> 00:09:28.984
but nothing similar exists
for the earth's landscapes.

00:09:29.618 --> 00:09:32.491
We've lost 50 percent of our rain forests.

00:09:32.515 --> 00:09:35.426
We lose 18 million acres
of forest every year.

00:09:35.965 --> 00:09:41.405
And rising sea levels will make cities,
countries and continents

00:09:41.429 --> 00:09:43.357
completely unrecognizable.

00:09:44.073 --> 00:09:46.723
Unless we have a record of these places,

00:09:46.747 --> 00:09:49.224
no one in the future
will know they existed.

00:09:50.182 --> 00:09:52.340
If the earth is the Titanic,

00:09:52.364 --> 00:09:54.213
we've struck the iceberg,

00:09:54.237 --> 00:09:55.767
everyone's on deck

00:09:55.791 --> 00:09:57.524
and the orchestra is playing.

00:09:58.183 --> 00:10:02.957
The climate crisis threatens to destroy
our cultural and ecological patrimony

00:10:02.981 --> 00:10:04.404
within decades.

00:10:04.786 --> 00:10:07.272
But sitting on our hands and doing nothing

00:10:07.296 --> 00:10:08.821
is not an option.

00:10:09.525 --> 00:10:12.597
Shouldn't we save everything
we can on the lifeboats?

00:10:13.357 --> 00:10:19.438
(Applause)

00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:25.217
Looking at my scans
from Honduras and Mexico,

00:10:25.241 --> 00:10:28.550
it's clear that we need
to scan, scan, scan

00:10:28.574 --> 00:10:30.981
now as much as possible,

00:10:31.005 --> 00:10:32.430
while we still can.

00:10:33.128 --> 00:10:35.622
That's what inspired the Earth Archive,

00:10:35.646 --> 00:10:38.283
an unprecedented scientific effort

00:10:38.307 --> 00:10:41.027
to LiDAR-scan the entire planet,

00:10:41.051 --> 00:10:43.343
starting with areas
that are most threatened.

00:10:44.226 --> 00:10:46.234
Its purpose is threefold.

00:10:46.717 --> 00:10:52.258
Number one: create a baseline record
of the earth as it exists today

00:10:52.282 --> 00:10:55.105
to more effectively mitigate
the climate crisis.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.550
To measure change, you need
two sets of data:

00:10:58.574 --> 00:11:00.797
a before and an after.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.577
Right now, we don't have
a high-resolution before data set

00:11:05.601 --> 00:11:07.489
for much of the planet,

00:11:07.513 --> 00:11:09.454
so we can't measure change,

00:11:09.478 --> 00:11:12.130
and we can't evaluate
which of our current efforts

00:11:12.154 --> 00:11:14.446
to combat the climate crisis

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:16.392
are making a positive impact.

00:11:17.742 --> 00:11:21.765
Number two: create a virtual planet

00:11:22.718 --> 00:11:26.843
so that any number of scientists
can study our earth today.

00:11:27.365 --> 00:11:31.195
Archaeologists like me
can look for undocumented settlements.

00:11:31.563 --> 00:11:34.194
Ecologists can study tree size,

00:11:34.218 --> 00:11:36.257
forest composition and age.

00:11:36.895 --> 00:11:39.194
Geologists can study hydrology,

00:11:39.218 --> 00:11:40.942
faults, disturbance.

00:11:41.688 --> 00:11:43.192
The possibilities are endless.

00:11:44.422 --> 00:11:47.632
Number three: preserve
a record of the planet

00:11:47.656 --> 00:11:50.239
for our grandchildren's grandchildren,

00:11:50.263 --> 00:11:55.934
so they can reconstruct and study
lost cultural patrimony in the future.

00:11:56.808 --> 00:11:59.560
As science and technology advance,

00:11:59.584 --> 00:12:02.754
they'll apply new tools, algorithms,

00:12:02.778 --> 00:12:06.524
even AI to LiDAR scans done today,

00:12:06.548 --> 00:12:10.355
and ask questions that we
can't currently conceive of.

00:12:11.513 --> 00:12:13.280
Like Notre Dame,

00:12:13.304 --> 00:12:17.496
we can't imagine how these
records will be used.

00:12:18.035 --> 00:12:20.599
But we know that they'll
be critically important.

00:12:22.053 --> 00:12:26.126
The Earth Archive is the ultimate gift
to future generations,

00:12:27.126 --> 00:12:28.591
because the truth be told,

00:12:29.638 --> 00:12:31.966
I won't live long enough
to see its full impact,

00:12:32.902 --> 00:12:34.331
and neither will you.

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:38.027
That's exactly why it's worth doing.

00:12:39.218 --> 00:12:42.642
The Earth Archive is a bet
on the future of humanity.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.307
It's a bet that together,

00:12:45.331 --> 00:12:46.948
collectively,

00:12:46.972 --> 00:12:50.039
as people and as scientists,

00:12:50.063 --> 00:12:52.770
that we'll face the climate crisis

00:12:52.794 --> 00:12:54.994
and that we'll choose
to do the right thing,

00:12:55.915 --> 00:12:57.845
not just for us today

00:12:58.932 --> 00:13:01.878
but to honor those who came before us

00:13:01.902 --> 00:13:06.257
and to pay it forward
to future generations

00:13:06.281 --> 00:13:08.563
who will carry on our legacy.

00:13:09.373 --> 00:13:10.539
Thank you.

00:13:10.903 --> 00:13:13.388
(Applause)
