(Mosquito buzzing)

00:00:14.628 --> 00:00:17.494
Greg Gage: We've all heard
the annoying sound of a mosquito,

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.740
and we will stop at nothing
to make it go away.

00:00:19.764 --> 00:00:21.669
While this sound may be maddening to us,

00:00:21.693 --> 00:00:23.612
perhaps it's music to a mosquito's ears.

00:00:23.636 --> 00:00:27.870
The mosquito's nervous system has almost
as many sensory auditory cells as we do.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.910
But why would they have
so many in such a small body,

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:33.481
and why would they need to be
so sensitive to sounds?

00:00:33.505 --> 00:00:34.698
The answer is love.

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:36.635
[DIY Neuroscience]

00:00:36.665 --> 00:00:39.605
(Music)

00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:41.731
As humans, we do a lot
to attract each other.

00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:43.150
Some things are conscious --

00:00:43.174 --> 00:00:45.274
we put on makeup
and make sure we smell nice.

00:00:45.298 --> 00:00:46.524
And some are unconscious.

00:00:46.548 --> 00:00:50.168
You may unconsciously point your body
or even sit closer to someone you like.

00:00:50.192 --> 00:00:53.579
These are courtship behaviors,
and a lot of animals have them.

00:00:53.603 --> 00:00:55.205
And mosquitoes are no different.

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.523
So Haley's been spending her summer
bravely listening to mosquitoes,

00:00:58.547 --> 00:01:00.468
and what she observed may surprise you.

00:01:00.492 --> 00:01:03.923
So we want to investigate
how the mosquitoes make their song.

00:01:03.947 --> 00:01:06.486
So Haley, how do we record
their wing beats?

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.295
Haley Smith: We need to tether them.

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:13.098
First, we anesthetize them
in a fridge or a bed of ice.

00:01:13.122 --> 00:01:16.575
And then I transfer them
to this petri dish of ice,

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:18.505
just to get them even more anesthetized.

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:22.053
Next, I take an insect pin,

00:01:22.077 --> 00:01:26.554
and what I do is put a tiny little dab
of superglue on this pin.

00:01:26.578 --> 00:01:30.318
I want to make sure that I get it
on his thorax above his wings

00:01:30.342 --> 00:01:33.795
so that when he is suspended,
his wings are still free to move.

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:34.978
So here's one down.

00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:37.527
It's really hard to catch
male mosquitoes in the wild

00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:41.804
because females are the only mosquitoes
that are attracted to humans.

00:01:41.828 --> 00:01:43.424
They feed on human blood.

00:01:43.448 --> 00:01:48.769
And now, we can try to get
some recordings from them.

00:01:48.793 --> 00:01:51.090
So this is the stand
that I use to hold them.

00:01:51.114 --> 00:01:53.269
I like to place it
right over the microphone

00:01:53.293 --> 00:01:56.084
so that I can get a recording
of the buzzing that you hear.

00:01:56.108 --> 00:01:59.109
That sound is generated
by how fast they're beating their wings.

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:00.371
This is a male.

00:02:00.395 --> 00:02:04.071
The males have very bushy antennae,
and they look kind of feathery.

00:02:04.095 --> 00:02:06.611
And they are also much smaller.

00:02:06.635 --> 00:02:09.899
GG: So he's flying at around 600 hertz.

00:02:09.923 --> 00:02:12.400
Can we try a female mosquito?

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:14.454
HS: Sure, here we go.

00:02:14.478 --> 00:02:20.129
(Mosquito buzzing, lower pitch)

00:02:20.153 --> 00:02:21.399
GG: Wow.

00:02:21.423 --> 00:02:23.959
HS: This is a much lower
frequency than the male.

00:02:23.983 --> 00:02:26.118
GG: Yeah, it sounds completely different.

00:02:26.142 --> 00:02:27.999
(Mosquito buzzing)

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:30.499
(Mosquito buzzing, lower pitch)

00:02:30.523 --> 00:02:32.887
So is it because they're
two different mosquitoes,

00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:34.592
or because they're male and female?

00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:36.533
HS: It's because
they're male and female.

00:02:36.557 --> 00:02:38.198
GG: Alright, let's verify that.

00:02:38.222 --> 00:02:40.809
Can you bring in another female
and see if she sounds

00:02:40.833 --> 00:02:42.707
like mosquito A or mosquito B?

00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:43.882
HS: Yeah.

00:02:43.906 --> 00:02:45.659
(Mosquito buzzing, lower pitch)

00:02:45.683 --> 00:02:47.755
And again, she is much lower
than the male.

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:49.476
GG: Yeah, she sounds different.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.150
(Mosquito buzzing, lower pitch)

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:56.676
Yeah, she's spot-on 400.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.834
HS: She really is.
GG: That's really bizarre.

00:02:58.858 --> 00:03:02.597
HS: The females are at a much
lower pitch. They were around 400 hertz.

00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:04.914
HS: And all of the females
were around that, too.

00:03:04.938 --> 00:03:06.747
They were much larger than the males,

00:03:06.771 --> 00:03:10.218
so they didn't have to flap their wings
as fast to stay in free flight.

00:03:10.242 --> 00:03:13.235
GG: So they have larger wings,
so they're flapping slower.

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:16.584
And you noticed that all the females
have the same frequency, roughly?

00:03:16.608 --> 00:03:19.021
And the males do, too.
That's kind of interesting.

00:03:19.045 --> 00:03:20.565
So that must mean something.

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:24.131
Well, let's see what happens when
we put the male and the female together.

00:03:24.155 --> 00:03:28.152
(Mosquitoes buzzing; pitch varies)

00:03:28.176 --> 00:03:30.511
HS: When I put them
into the same hearing range,

00:03:30.535 --> 00:03:33.319
I noticed that they were kind of
changing their tones.

00:03:33.343 --> 00:03:35.605
It was kind of more dull, almost.

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.206
(Mosquitoes buzzing)

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.969
And when I put it back in my spectrogram
to see their interaction,

00:03:40.993 --> 00:03:43.318
they were meeting at the same tone.

00:03:43.342 --> 00:03:44.803
GG: OK, pause.

00:03:44.827 --> 00:03:47.120
The males and females are singing a duet,

00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:50.574
meaning that they adjust their wings
to be able to produce a common tone.

00:03:50.598 --> 00:03:53.272
You have the male singing up here at G,

00:03:53.296 --> 00:03:56.149
and you have the female
singing down here at D,

00:03:56.173 --> 00:03:57.461
and when they get together,

00:03:57.485 --> 00:04:00.698
you're saying that they change
the frequency of their wings

00:04:00.722 --> 00:04:02.185
such that they come together?

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.648
HS: Yeah, exactly.
GG: And they sort of sing a duet.

00:04:04.672 --> 00:04:09.775
(Mosquitoes gradually
adjusting to identical pitch)

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.116
HS: They're communicating
to let each other know

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.298
that they've basically
found a potential mate.

00:04:14.322 --> 00:04:15.472
GG: So in other words,

00:04:15.496 --> 00:04:18.492
the female tends to choose
a male that best sings her duet.

00:04:18.516 --> 00:04:20.659
And studies have found
that if she's pregnant,

00:04:20.683 --> 00:04:21.915
she doesn't even bother.

00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:25.344
So if we can understand
the mosquito mating behavior,

00:04:25.368 --> 00:04:29.445
we may be able to disrupt it in the wild
and prevent diseases like malaria.

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:33.349
But for now, the next time
you hear a mosquito buzzing,

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:36.644
just pause and remember she may be in love

00:04:36.668 --> 00:04:38.222
and she may be singing her song,

00:04:38.246 --> 00:04:40.178
looking for her perfect match.

00:04:40.202 --> 00:04:41.203
(Mosquito buzzing)

00:04:41.227 --> 00:04:42.377
