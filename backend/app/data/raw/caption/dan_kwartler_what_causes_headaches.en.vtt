00:00:07.517 --> 00:00:12.321
In ancient Greece, headaches were
considered powerful afflictions.

00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:16.648
Victims prayed for relief from Asclepius,
the god of medicine.

00:00:16.648 --> 00:00:18.003
And if pain continued,

00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:21.951
a medical practitioner would perform 
the best-known remedy—

00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:28.587
drilling a small hole in the
skull to drain supposedly infected blood.

00:00:28.587 --> 00:00:31.507
This dire technique, called trepanation,

00:00:31.507 --> 00:00:35.869
often replaced the headache 
with a more permanent condition.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:40.753
Fortunately, doctors today don’t resort 
to power tools to cure headaches.

00:00:40.753 --> 00:00:45.199
But we still have a lot
to learn about this ancient ailment.

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.116
Today, we’ve classified headaches 
into two camps—

00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:49.327
primary headaches

00:00:49.327 --> 00:00:50.867
and secondary headaches.

00:00:50.867 --> 00:00:55.889
The former are not symptomatic of an
underlying disease, injury, or condition;

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.537
they are the condition.

00:00:57.537 --> 00:00:59.468
But we’ll come back to them in a minute

00:00:59.468 --> 00:01:03.667
because while primary headaches 
account for 50% of reported cases,

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:07.776
we actually know much more 
about secondary headaches.

00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:10.797
These are caused by other health problems,

00:01:10.797 --> 00:01:14.418
with triggers ranging 
from dehydration and caffeine withdrawal

00:01:14.418 --> 00:01:15.977
to head and neck injury,

00:01:15.977 --> 00:01:17.898
and heart disease.

00:01:17.898 --> 00:01:22.550
Doctors have classified 
over 150 diagnosable types,

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.158
all with different potential causes, 
symptoms, and treatments.

00:01:27.158 --> 00:01:31.886
But we’ll take just one common case 
—a sinus infection—as an example.

00:01:31.886 --> 00:01:34.676
The sinuses are a system of cavities

00:01:34.676 --> 00:01:39.098
that spread behind 
our foreheads, noses, and upper cheeks.

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:40.878
When our sinuses are infected,

00:01:40.878 --> 00:01:43.599
our immune response heats up the area,

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:49.847
roasting the bacteria and inflaming 
the cavities well past their usual size.

00:01:49.847 --> 00:01:54.278
The engorged sinuses put pressure 
on the cranial arteries and veins,

00:01:54.278 --> 00:01:57.086
as well as muscles in the neck and head.

00:01:57.086 --> 00:02:01.826
Their pain receptors, called nociceptors,
trigger in response,

00:02:01.826 --> 00:02:05.049
cueing the brain to release a flood 
of neuropeptides

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.357
that inflame the cranial blood
vessels, swelling and heating up the head.

00:02:10.357 --> 00:02:13.617
This discomfort, 
paired with hyper-sensitive head muscles,

00:02:13.617 --> 00:02:18.017
creates the sore, 
throbbing pain of a headache.

00:02:18.017 --> 00:02:20.765
Not all headache pain comes from swelling.

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:23.738
Tense muscles and inflamed, 
sensitive nerves

00:02:23.738 --> 00:02:27.455
cause varying degrees 
of discomfort in each headache.

00:02:27.455 --> 00:02:32.057
But all cases are reactions 
to some cranial irritant.

00:02:32.057 --> 00:02:34.926
While the cause is clear 
in secondary headaches,

00:02:34.926 --> 00:02:39.146
the origins of primary headaches 
remain unknown.

00:02:39.146 --> 00:02:41.927
Scientists are still investigating 
potential triggers

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:44.607
for the three types of primary headaches:

00:02:44.607 --> 00:02:46.837
recurring, long-lasting migraines;

00:02:46.837 --> 00:02:50.217
intensely painful, 
rapid-fire cluster headaches;

00:02:50.217 --> 00:02:53.837
and, most common of all, 
the tension headache.

00:02:53.837 --> 00:02:55.438
As the name suggests,

00:02:55.438 --> 00:02:58.418
tension headaches are known for creating 
the sensation

00:02:58.418 --> 00:03:02.087
of a tight band squeezed around the head.

00:03:02.087 --> 00:03:05.548
These headaches increase the tenderness of
the pericranial muscles,

00:03:05.548 --> 00:03:09.677
which then painfully pulse 
with blood and oxygen.

00:03:09.677 --> 00:03:14.625
Patients report stress, dehydration, 
and hormone changes as triggers,

00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:17.767
but these don’t fit 
the symptoms quite right.

00:03:17.767 --> 00:03:20.589
For example, in dehydration headaches,

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:23.728
the frontal lobe actually 
shrinks away from the skull,

00:03:23.728 --> 00:03:25.537
creating forehead swelling

00:03:25.537 --> 00:03:29.497
that doesn’t match the location 
of the pain in tension headaches.

00:03:29.497 --> 00:03:32.687
Scientists have theories 
for what the actual cause is,

00:03:32.687 --> 00:03:34.947
ranging from spasming blood vessels

00:03:34.947 --> 00:03:37.587
to overly sensitive nociceptors,

00:03:37.587 --> 00:03:39.698
but no one knows for sure.

00:03:39.698 --> 00:03:45.607
Meanwhile, most headache research is
focused on more severe primary headaches.

00:03:45.607 --> 00:03:50.757
Migraines are recurring headaches, which 
create a vise-like sensation on the skull

00:03:50.757 --> 00:03:53.657
that can last from four hours 
to three days.

00:03:53.657 --> 00:03:57.400
In 20% of cases, these attacks are
intense enough

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.596
to overload the brain 
with electrical energy,

00:04:00.596 --> 00:04:03.586
which hyper-excites sensory nerve endings.

00:04:03.586 --> 00:04:06.699
This produces hallucinations called auras,

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:08.997
which can include seeing flashing lights

00:04:08.997 --> 00:04:13.766
and geometric patterns 
and experiencing tingling sensations.

00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:16.936
Cluster headaches, 
another primary headache type,

00:04:16.936 --> 00:04:20.747
cause burning, stabbing bursts
of pain behind one eye,

00:04:20.747 --> 00:04:25.918
leading to a red eye, constricted pupil, 
and drooping eyelid.

00:04:25.918 --> 00:04:28.437
What can be done about these conditions,

00:04:28.437 --> 00:04:31.586
which dramatically affect 
many people’s quality of life?

00:04:31.586 --> 00:04:34.408
Tension headaches and most secondary cases

00:04:34.408 --> 00:04:37.286
can be treated with 
over-the-counter pain medications,

00:04:37.286 --> 00:04:41.347
such as anti-inflammatory drugs 
that reduce cranial swelling.

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:43.537
And many secondary headache triggers,

00:04:43.537 --> 00:04:44.967
like dehydration,

00:04:44.967 --> 00:04:45.928
eye strain,

00:04:45.928 --> 00:04:47.017
and stress,

00:04:47.017 --> 00:04:49.116
can be proactively avoided.

00:04:49.116 --> 00:04:51.989
Migraines and cluster headaches 
are more complicated,

00:04:51.989 --> 00:04:56.899
and we haven’t yet discovered reliable 
treatments that work for everyone.

00:04:56.899 --> 00:05:00.938
But thankfully, pharmacologists 
and neurologists are hard at work

00:05:00.938 --> 00:05:05.446
cracking these pressing mysteries 
that weigh so heavily on our minds.
