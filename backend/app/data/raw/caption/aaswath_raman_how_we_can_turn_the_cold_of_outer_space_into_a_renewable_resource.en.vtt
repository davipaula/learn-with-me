00:00:13.571 --> 00:00:15.586
Every summer when I was growing up,

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.992
I would fly from my home in Canada
to visit my grandparents,

00:00:19.016 --> 00:00:20.816
who lived in Mumbai, India.

00:00:21.157 --> 00:00:24.291
Now, Canadian summers
are pretty mild at best --

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:28.022
about 22 degrees Celsius
or 72 degrees Fahrenheit

00:00:28.046 --> 00:00:30.666
is a typical summer's day,
and not too hot.

00:00:31.276 --> 00:00:34.315
Mumbai, on the other hand,
is a hot and humid place

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:37.557
well into the 30s Celsius
or 90s Fahrenheit.

00:00:38.364 --> 00:00:39.950
As soon as I'd reach it, I'd ask,

00:00:39.974 --> 00:00:44.384
"How could anyone live, work
or sleep in such weather?"

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.185
To make things worse, my grandparents
didn't have an air conditioner.

00:00:49.768 --> 00:00:52.593
And while I tried my very, very best,

00:00:52.617 --> 00:00:55.371
I was never able
to persuade them to get one.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.315
But this is changing, and fast.

00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:04.255
Cooling systems today
collectively account for 17 percent

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:06.652
of the electricity we use worldwide.

00:01:06.676 --> 00:01:09.070
This includes everything
from the air conditioners

00:01:09.094 --> 00:01:11.871
I so desperately wanted
during my summer vacations,

00:01:11.895 --> 00:01:15.505
to the refrigeration systems
that keep our food safe and cold for us

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:16.760
in our supermarkets,

00:01:16.784 --> 00:01:21.036
to the industrial scale systems
that keep our data centers operational.

00:01:21.624 --> 00:01:25.109
Collectively, these systems
account for eight percent

00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:27.383
of global greenhouse gas emissions.

00:01:27.823 --> 00:01:29.434
But what keeps me up at night

00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:34.379
is that our energy use for cooling
might grow sixfold by the year 2050,

00:01:34.403 --> 00:01:38.684
primarily driven by increasing usage
in Asian and African countries.

00:01:39.284 --> 00:01:40.982
I've seen this firsthand.

00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:44.164
Nearly every apartment
in and around my grandmother's place

00:01:44.188 --> 00:01:46.212
now has an air conditioner.

00:01:46.236 --> 00:01:49.283
And that is, emphatically, a good thing

00:01:49.307 --> 00:01:52.006
for the health, well-being
and productivity

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.675
of people living in warmer climates.

00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:59.774
However, one of the most
alarming things about climate change

00:01:59.798 --> 00:02:02.393
is that the warmer our planet gets,

00:02:02.417 --> 00:02:04.729
the more we're going to need
cooling systems --

00:02:04.753 --> 00:02:08.512
systems that are themselves large
emitters of greenhouse gas emissions.

00:02:09.236 --> 00:02:12.569
This then has the potential
to cause a feedback loop,

00:02:12.593 --> 00:02:14.051
where cooling systems alone

00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:17.062
could become one of our biggest sources
of greenhouse gases

00:02:17.086 --> 00:02:18.428
later this century.

00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:19.913
In the worst case,

00:02:19.937 --> 00:02:23.557
we might need more than 10 trillion
kilowatt-hours of electricity every year,

00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:26.269
just for cooling, by the year 2100.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:29.711
That's half our electricity supply today.

00:02:30.198 --> 00:02:31.348
Just for cooling.

00:02:32.862 --> 00:02:36.777
But this also point us
to an amazing opportunity.

00:02:37.444 --> 00:02:42.013
A 10 or 20 percent improvement
in the efficiency of every cooling system

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:45.521
could actually have an enormous impact
on our greenhouse gas emissions,

00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:48.010
both today and later this century.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.629
And it could help us avert
that worst-case feedback loop.

00:02:54.928 --> 00:02:58.608
I'm a scientist who thinks a lot
about light and heat.

00:02:58.632 --> 00:03:02.228
In particular, how new materials
allow us to alter the flow

00:03:02.252 --> 00:03:04.268
of these basic elements of nature

00:03:04.292 --> 00:03:06.934
in ways we might have
once thought impossible.

00:03:07.315 --> 00:03:09.728
So, while I always understood
the value of cooling

00:03:09.752 --> 00:03:11.696
during my summer vacations,

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.983
I actually wound up
working on this problem

00:03:14.007 --> 00:03:18.013
because of an intellectual puzzle
that I came across about six years ago.

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:24.766
How were ancient peoples
able to make ice in desert climates?

00:03:25.894 --> 00:03:28.830
This is a picture of an ice house,

00:03:28.854 --> 00:03:32.481
also called a Yakhchal,
located in the southwest of Iran.

00:03:33.006 --> 00:03:36.760
There are ruins of dozens
of such structures throughout Iran,

00:03:36.784 --> 00:03:40.474
with evidence of similar such buildings
throughout the rest of the Middle East

00:03:40.498 --> 00:03:41.712
and all the way to China.

00:03:42.228 --> 00:03:45.418
The people who operated
this ice house many centuries ago,

00:03:45.442 --> 00:03:47.926
would pour water
in the pool you see on the left

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.022
in the early evening hours,
as the sun set.

00:03:51.046 --> 00:03:52.855
And then something amazing happened.

00:03:53.442 --> 00:03:56.204
Even though the air temperature
might be above freezing,

00:03:56.228 --> 00:03:59.926
say five degrees Celsius
or 41 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.484
the water would freeze.

00:04:02.724 --> 00:04:06.859
The ice generated would then be collected
in the early morning hours

00:04:06.883 --> 00:04:09.518
and stored for use in the building
you see on the right,

00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:11.478
all the way through the summer months.

00:04:12.133 --> 00:04:14.852
You've actually likely seen
something very similar at play

00:04:14.876 --> 00:04:18.328
if you've ever noticed frost form
on the ground on a clear night,

00:04:18.352 --> 00:04:21.097
even when the air temperature
is well above freezing.

00:04:21.121 --> 00:04:22.281
But wait.

00:04:22.305 --> 00:04:26.036
How did the water freeze
if the air temperature is above freezing?

00:04:26.487 --> 00:04:28.413
Evaporation could have played an effect,

00:04:28.437 --> 00:04:31.752
but that's not enough to actually
cause the water to become ice.

00:04:32.064 --> 00:04:34.150
Something else must have cooled it down.

00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:37.309
Think about a pie
cooling on a window sill.

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:41.230
For it to be able to cool down,
its heat needs to flow somewhere cooler.

00:04:41.254 --> 00:04:43.158
Namely, the air that surrounds it.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.490
As implausible as it may sound,

00:04:46.514 --> 00:04:51.890
for that pool of water, its heat
is actually flowing to the cold of space.

00:04:54.085 --> 00:04:55.807
How is this possible?

00:04:56.434 --> 00:05:00.006
Well, that pool of water,
like most natural materials,

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.180
sends out its heat as light.

00:05:02.506 --> 00:05:05.323
This is a concept
known as thermal radiation.

00:05:05.792 --> 00:05:10.260
In fact, we're all sending out our heat
as infrared light right now,

00:05:10.284 --> 00:05:12.212
to each other and our surroundings.

00:05:12.608 --> 00:05:15.077
We can actually visualize this
with thermal cameras

00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:18.347
and the images they produce,
like the ones I'm showing you right now.

00:05:18.744 --> 00:05:21.006
So that pool of water
is sending out its heat

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.712
upward towards the atmosphere.

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:25.474
The atmosphere and the molecules in it

00:05:25.498 --> 00:05:28.053
absorb some of that heat and send it back.

00:05:28.077 --> 00:05:31.899
That's actually the greenhouse effect
that's responsible for climate change.

00:05:32.435 --> 00:05:34.958
But here's the critical thing
to understand.

00:05:34.982 --> 00:05:38.182
Our atmosphere doesn't absorb
all of that heat.

00:05:38.577 --> 00:05:41.511
If it did, we'd be
on a much warmer planet.

00:05:41.982 --> 00:05:43.490
At certain wavelengths,

00:05:43.514 --> 00:05:46.966
in particular between
eight and 13 microns,

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.752
our atmosphere has what's known
as a transmission window.

00:05:51.402 --> 00:05:56.919
This window allows some of the heat
that goes up as infrared light

00:05:56.943 --> 00:06:00.276
to effectively escape,
carrying away that pool's heat.

00:06:00.895 --> 00:06:04.665
And it can escape to a place
that is much, much colder.

00:06:05.633 --> 00:06:07.601
The cold of this upper atmosphere

00:06:07.625 --> 00:06:09.299
and all the way out to outer space,

00:06:09.323 --> 00:06:13.133
which can be as cold
as minus 270 degrees Celsius,

00:06:13.157 --> 00:06:15.877
or minus 454 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:06:17.242 --> 00:06:20.606
So that pool of water is able
to send out more heat to the sky

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.401
than the sky sends back to it.

00:06:22.425 --> 00:06:23.575
And because of that,

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:26.615
the pool will cool down
below its surroundings' temperature.

00:06:28.035 --> 00:06:31.551
This is an effect
known as night-sky cooling

00:06:31.575 --> 00:06:32.975
or radiative cooling.

00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:36.823
And it's always been understood
by climate scientists and meteorologists

00:06:36.847 --> 00:06:39.447
as a very important natural phenomenon.

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:42.371
When I came across all of this,

00:06:42.395 --> 00:06:45.037
it was towards the end
of my PhD at Stanford.

00:06:45.061 --> 00:06:49.490
And I was amazed by its apparent
simplicity as a cooling method,

00:06:49.514 --> 00:06:50.780
yet really puzzled.

00:06:51.284 --> 00:06:53.484
Why aren't we making use of this?

00:06:54.744 --> 00:06:57.625
Now, scientists and engineers
had investigated this idea

00:06:57.649 --> 00:06:58.887
in previous decades.

00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:02.199
But there turned out to be
at least one big problem.

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:05.751
It was called night-sky
cooling for a reason.

00:07:06.109 --> 00:07:07.283
Why?

00:07:07.307 --> 00:07:09.676
Well, it's a little thing called the sun.

00:07:10.157 --> 00:07:12.617
So, for the surface
that's doing the cooling,

00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:14.815
it needs to be able to face the sky.

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:16.467
And during the middle of the day,

00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:19.641
when we might want
something cold the most,

00:07:19.665 --> 00:07:22.561
unfortunately, that means
you're going to look up to the sun.

00:07:22.585 --> 00:07:24.441
And the sun heats most materials up

00:07:24.465 --> 00:07:27.222
enough to completely counteract
this cooling effect.

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:30.417
My colleagues and I
spend a lot of our time

00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:32.553
thinking about how
we can structure materials

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:33.989
at very small length scales

00:07:34.013 --> 00:07:37.339
such that they can do
new and useful things with light --

00:07:37.363 --> 00:07:40.353
length scales smaller
than the wavelength of light itself.

00:07:40.377 --> 00:07:41.957
Using insights from this field,

00:07:41.981 --> 00:07:45.109
known as nanophotonics
or metamaterials research,

00:07:45.133 --> 00:07:48.633
we realized that there might be a way
to make this possible during the day

00:07:48.657 --> 00:07:49.830
for the first time.

00:07:49.854 --> 00:07:52.910
To do this, I designed
a multilayer optical material

00:07:52.934 --> 00:07:54.791
shown here in a microscope image.

00:07:54.815 --> 00:07:58.196
It's more than 40 times thinner
than a typical human hair.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.738
And it's able to do
two things simultaneously.

00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:02.994
First, it sends its heat out

00:08:03.018 --> 00:08:06.820
precisely where our atmosphere
lets that heat out the best.

00:08:06.844 --> 00:08:08.977
We targeted the window to space.

00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:12.950
The second thing it does
is it avoids getting heated up by the sun.

00:08:12.974 --> 00:08:15.374
It's a very good mirror to sunlight.

00:08:16.315 --> 00:08:19.029
The first time I tested this
was on a rooftop in Stanford

00:08:19.053 --> 00:08:20.815
that I'm showing you right here.

00:08:21.339 --> 00:08:23.720
I left the device out for a little while,

00:08:23.744 --> 00:08:26.815
and I walked up to it after a few minutes,

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:29.633
and within seconds, I knew it was working.

00:08:29.657 --> 00:08:30.815
How?

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:32.466
I touched it, and it felt cold.

00:08:33.395 --> 00:08:38.053
(Applause)

00:08:38.862 --> 00:08:42.846
Just to emphasize how weird
and counterintuitive this is:

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.600
this material and others like it

00:08:44.624 --> 00:08:47.529
will get colder when we take them
out of the shade,

00:08:47.553 --> 00:08:49.913
even though the sun is shining on it.

00:08:49.937 --> 00:08:52.620
I'm showing you data here
from our very first experiment,

00:08:52.644 --> 00:08:55.383
where that material stayed
more than five degrees Celsius,

00:08:55.407 --> 00:08:58.683
or nine degrees Fahrenheit, colder
than the air temperature,

00:08:58.707 --> 00:09:01.521
even though the sun
was shining directly on it.

00:09:02.855 --> 00:09:05.990
The manufacturing method we used
to actually make this material

00:09:06.014 --> 00:09:08.548
already exists at large volume scales.

00:09:08.903 --> 00:09:10.060
So I was really excited,

00:09:10.084 --> 00:09:13.125
because not only
do we make something cool,

00:09:13.149 --> 00:09:18.202
but we might actually have the opportunity
to do something real and make it useful.

00:09:19.204 --> 00:09:21.117
That brings me to the next big question.

00:09:21.141 --> 00:09:23.728
How do you actually
save energy with this idea?

00:09:23.752 --> 00:09:27.410
Well, we believe the most direct way
to save energy with this technology

00:09:27.434 --> 00:09:29.093
is as an efficiency boost

00:09:29.117 --> 00:09:32.180
for today's air-conditioning
and refrigeration systems.

00:09:32.561 --> 00:09:34.720
To do this, we've built
fluid cooling panels,

00:09:34.744 --> 00:09:36.315
like the ones shown right here.

00:09:36.339 --> 00:09:39.006
These panels have a similar shape
to solar water heaters,

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.950
except they do the opposite --
they cool the water, passively,

00:09:41.974 --> 00:09:44.041
using our specialized material.

00:09:44.815 --> 00:09:47.275
These panels can then
be integrated with a component

00:09:47.299 --> 00:09:49.867
almost every cooling system has,
called a condenser,

00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:53.024
to improve the system's
underlying efficiency.

00:09:53.367 --> 00:09:55.263
Our start-up, SkyCool Systems,

00:09:55.287 --> 00:09:59.161
has recently completed a field trial
in Davis, California, shown right here.

00:09:59.649 --> 00:10:00.831
In that demonstration,

00:10:00.855 --> 00:10:03.903
we showed that we could actually
improve the efficiency

00:10:03.927 --> 00:10:06.851
of that cooling system
as much as 12 percent in the field.

00:10:07.474 --> 00:10:08.728
Over the next year or two,

00:10:08.752 --> 00:10:12.656
I'm super excited to see this go
to its first commercial-scale pilots

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.823
in both the air conditioning
and refrigeration space.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.847
In the future, we might be able
to integrate these kinds of panels

00:10:19.871 --> 00:10:23.180
with higher efficiency
building cooling systems

00:10:23.204 --> 00:10:26.006
to reduce their energy
usage by two-thirds.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:29.688
And eventually, we might actually
be able to build a cooling system

00:10:29.712 --> 00:10:32.275
that requires no electricity input at all.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:34.482
As a first step towards that,

00:10:34.506 --> 00:10:36.363
my colleagues at Stanford and I

00:10:36.387 --> 00:10:38.413
have shown that you could
actually maintain

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:43.006
something more than 42 degrees Celsius
below the air temperature

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.418
with better engineering.

00:10:45.165 --> 00:10:46.315
Thank you.

00:10:46.339 --> 00:10:50.394
(Applause)

00:10:51.196 --> 00:10:52.347
So just imagine that --

00:10:52.371 --> 00:10:55.774
something that is below freezing
on a hot summer's day.

00:10:57.927 --> 00:11:02.410
So, while I'm very excited
about all we can do for cooling,

00:11:02.434 --> 00:11:05.688
and I think there's a lot yet to be done,

00:11:05.712 --> 00:11:09.180
as a scientist, I'm also drawn
to a more profound opportunity

00:11:09.204 --> 00:11:11.220
that I believe this work highlights.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.895
We can use the cold darkness of space

00:11:14.919 --> 00:11:16.569
to improve the efficiency

00:11:16.593 --> 00:11:19.847
of every energy-related
process here on earth.

00:11:21.204 --> 00:11:24.521
One such process
I'd like to highlight are solar cells.

00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:26.379
They heat up under the sun

00:11:26.403 --> 00:11:28.887
and become less efficient
the hotter they are.

00:11:29.276 --> 00:11:33.153
In 2015, we showed that
with deliberate kinds of microstructures

00:11:33.177 --> 00:11:34.724
on top of a solar cell,

00:11:34.748 --> 00:11:37.592
we could take better advantage
of this cooling effect

00:11:37.616 --> 00:11:41.315
to maintain a solar cell passively
at a lower temperature.

00:11:41.708 --> 00:11:44.029
This allows the cell
to operate more efficiently.

00:11:44.627 --> 00:11:47.595
We're probing these kinds
of opportunities further.

00:11:47.619 --> 00:11:50.864
We're asking whether
we can use the cold of space

00:11:50.888 --> 00:11:52.967
to help us with water conservation.

00:11:53.316 --> 00:11:55.665
Or perhaps with off-grid scenarios.

00:11:55.689 --> 00:11:59.856
Perhaps we could even directly
generate power with this cold.

00:12:00.522 --> 00:12:03.475
There's a large temperature difference
between us here on earth

00:12:03.499 --> 00:12:05.189
and the cold of space.

00:12:05.213 --> 00:12:07.341
That difference, at least conceptually,

00:12:07.365 --> 00:12:09.959
could be used to drive
something called a heat engine

00:12:09.983 --> 00:12:11.173
to generate electricity.

00:12:11.967 --> 00:12:15.570
Could we then make a nighttime
power-generation device

00:12:15.594 --> 00:12:17.991
that generates useful
amounts of electricity

00:12:18.015 --> 00:12:19.919
when solar cells don't work?

00:12:19.943 --> 00:12:22.477
Could we generate light from darkness?

00:12:23.872 --> 00:12:28.261
Central to this ability
is being able to manage

00:12:28.285 --> 00:12:31.396
the thermal radiation
that's all around us.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.220
We're constantly bathed in infrared light;

00:12:34.666 --> 00:12:37.118
if we could bend it to our will,

00:12:37.142 --> 00:12:39.872
we could profoundly change
the flows of heat and energy

00:12:39.896 --> 00:12:42.629
that permeate around us every single day.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:46.531
This ability, coupled
with the cold darkness of space,

00:12:46.555 --> 00:12:49.864
points us to a future
where we, as a civilization,

00:12:49.888 --> 00:12:55.126
might be able to more intelligently manage
our thermal energy footprint

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.950
at the very largest scales.

00:12:57.904 --> 00:13:00.118
As we confront climate change,

00:13:00.142 --> 00:13:02.745
I believe having
this ability in our toolkit

00:13:02.769 --> 00:13:04.569
will prove to be essential.

00:13:05.428 --> 00:13:08.626
So, the next time
you're walking around outside,

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:14.994
yes, do marvel at how the sun
is essential to life on earth itself,

00:13:15.018 --> 00:13:19.694
but don't forget that the rest of the sky
has something to offer us as well.

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:21.684
Thank you.

00:13:21.708 --> 00:13:25.818
(Applause)
