00:00:06.998 --> 00:00:10.848
Let's say that it would take you
ten minutes to solve this puzzle.

00:00:10.872 --> 00:00:12.393
How long would it take

00:00:12.417 --> 00:00:15.773
if you received constant
electric shocks to your hands?

00:00:15.797 --> 00:00:17.159
Longer, right?

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.564
Because the pain would distract
you from the task.

00:00:19.588 --> 00:00:21.025
Well, maybe not;

00:00:21.049 --> 00:00:23.429
it depends on how you handle pain.

00:00:23.453 --> 00:00:25.337
Some people are distracted by pain.

00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:28.908
It takes them longer to complete a task,
and they do it less well.

00:00:28.932 --> 00:00:32.705
Other people use tasks to distract
themselves from pain,

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.957
and those people actually do the task

00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:37.626
faster and better when they're in pain

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.460
than when they're not.

00:00:39.484 --> 00:00:41.675
Some people can just send
their mind wandering

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.921
to distract themselves from pain.

00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:45.088
How can different people

00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:47.971
be subjected to the exact
same painful stimulus

00:00:47.995 --> 00:00:51.005
and yet experience
the pain so differently?

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:52.755
And why does this matter?

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:54.838
First of all, what is pain?

00:00:54.862 --> 00:00:58.481
Pain is an unpleasant sensory
and emotional experience,

00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:02.108
associated with actual
or potential tissue damage.

00:01:02.132 --> 00:01:03.820
Pain is something we experience,

00:01:03.844 --> 00:01:06.612
so it's best measured
by what you say it is.

00:01:06.636 --> 00:01:08.322
Pain has an intensity;

00:01:08.346 --> 00:01:09.868
you can describe it on a scale

00:01:09.892 --> 00:01:13.300
from zero, no pain, to ten,
the most pain imaginable.

00:01:14.104 --> 00:01:16.255
But pain also has a character,

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:20.587
like sharp, dull, burning, or aching.

00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:23.224
What exactly creates these
perceptions of pain?

00:01:24.026 --> 00:01:25.466
Well, when you get hurt,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.135
special tissue damage-sensing nerve cells,

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.221
called nociceptors, fire and send signals

00:01:31.245 --> 00:01:34.172
to the spinal cord
and then up to the brain.

00:01:34.196 --> 00:01:38.504
Processing work gets done
by cells called neurons and glia.

00:01:38.528 --> 00:01:40.481
This is your Grey matter.

00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:44.819
And brain superhighways carry information
as electrical impulses

00:01:44.843 --> 00:01:46.568
from one area to another.

00:01:46.592 --> 00:01:48.121
This is your white matter.

00:01:48.145 --> 00:01:51.423
The superhighway that carries
pain information

00:01:51.447 --> 00:01:53.368
from the spinal cord to the brain

00:01:53.392 --> 00:01:55.121
is our sensing pathway

00:01:55.145 --> 00:01:56.830
that ends in the cortex,

00:01:56.854 --> 00:01:59.107
a part of the brain
that decides what to do

00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:00.193
with the pain signal.

00:02:01.106 --> 00:02:03.337
Another system
of interconnected brain cells

00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:05.128
called the salience network

00:02:05.152 --> 00:02:07.588
decides what to pay attention to.

00:02:07.612 --> 00:02:09.883
Since pain can have serious consequences,

00:02:09.907 --> 00:02:13.616
the pain signal immediately activates
the salience network.

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:16.306
Now, you're paying attention.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.755
The brain also responds to the pain

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:21.256
and has to cope with these pain signals.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.355
So, motor pathways are activated

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.804
to take your hand off
a hot stove, for example.

00:02:26.621 --> 00:02:29.113
But modulation networks are also activated

00:02:29.137 --> 00:02:32.006
that deliver endorphins and enkephalins,

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.952
chemicals released when you're in pain
or during extreme exercise,

00:02:35.976 --> 00:02:37.921
creating the runner's high.

00:02:37.945 --> 00:02:41.208
These chemical systems help
regulate and reduce pain.

00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:44.394
All these networks
and pathways work together

00:02:44.418 --> 00:02:46.407
to create your pain experience,

00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:48.213
to prevent further tissue damage,

00:02:48.237 --> 00:02:50.255
and help you to cope with pain.

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.887
This system is similar for everyone,

00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:56.421
but the sensitivity and efficacy
of these brain circuits

00:02:56.445 --> 00:02:59.587
determines how much
you feel and cope with pain.

00:02:59.611 --> 00:03:02.589
This is why some people have
greater pain than others

00:03:02.613 --> 00:03:04.589
and why some develop chronic pain

00:03:04.613 --> 00:03:06.400
that does not respond to treatment,

00:03:06.424 --> 00:03:08.318
while others respond well.

00:03:08.342 --> 00:03:10.422
Variability in pain sensitivities

00:03:10.446 --> 00:03:13.156
is not so different
than all kinds of variability

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.836
in responses to other stimuli.

00:03:15.672 --> 00:03:17.727
Like how some people love roller coasters,

00:03:17.751 --> 00:03:20.920
but other people suffer
from terrible motion sickness.

00:03:20.944 --> 00:03:23.091
Why does it matter
that there is variability

00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:24.961
in our pain brain circuits?

00:03:24.985 --> 00:03:27.002
Well, there are many treatments for pain,

00:03:27.026 --> 00:03:28.754
targeting different systems.

00:03:28.778 --> 00:03:31.339
For mild pain,
non-prescription medications

00:03:31.363 --> 00:03:34.053
can act on cells
where the pain signals start.

00:03:34.077 --> 00:03:36.921
Other stronger pain
medicines and anesthetics

00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:40.506
work by reducing the activity
in pain-sensing circuits

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.323
or boosting our coping
system, or endorphins.

00:03:44.347 --> 00:03:47.172
Some people can cope with pain
using methods that involve

00:03:47.196 --> 00:03:50.671
distraction, relaxation, meditation, yoga,

00:03:50.695 --> 00:03:54.266
or strategies that can be taught,
like cognitive behavioral therapy.

00:03:55.177 --> 00:03:57.921
For some people who suffer
from severe chronic pain,

00:03:57.945 --> 00:03:59.619
that is pain that doesn't go away

00:03:59.643 --> 00:04:01.755
months after their injury
should have healed,

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:03.789
none of the regular treatments work.

00:04:03.813 --> 00:04:06.088
Traditionally, medical
science has been about

00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:08.084
testing treatments on large groups

00:04:08.108 --> 00:04:11.171
to determine what would help
a majority of patients.

00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:12.881
But this has usually left out

00:04:12.905 --> 00:04:14.905
some who didn't benefit from the treatment

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:16.753
or experienced side effects.

00:04:16.777 --> 00:04:20.139
Now, new treatments that directly
stimulate or block

00:04:20.163 --> 00:04:24.172
certain pain-sensing attention
or modulation networks

00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:25.838
are being developed,

00:04:25.862 --> 00:04:29.365
along with ways to tailor them
to individual patients,

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.818
using tools like magnetic
resonance imaging

00:04:31.842 --> 00:04:33.318
to map brain pathways.

00:04:34.215 --> 00:04:36.490
Figuring out how your brain
responds to pain

00:04:36.514 --> 00:04:39.451
is the key to finding
the best treatment for you.

00:04:39.475 --> 00:04:41.557
That's true personalized medicine.
