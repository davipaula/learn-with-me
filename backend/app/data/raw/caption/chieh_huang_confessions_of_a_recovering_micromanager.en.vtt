What I'm really here to do today
is talk to you about micromanagement

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.736
and what I learned about micromanagement

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.456
by being a micromanager
over the last few years of my life.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.576
But first off, what is micromanagement?

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.816
How do we really define it?

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.976
Well, I posit that it's actually taking
great, wonderful, imaginative people --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.216
like all of you --

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.136
bringing them in into an organization

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.736
and then crushing their souls --

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.976
(Laughter)

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.856
by telling them what font size to use.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.536
In the history of mankind,

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.376
has anyone ever said this?

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.856
"John, we were never going to close
that deal with Times New Roman,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.736
but because you insisted on Helvetica --

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.136
bam!

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.376
Dotted line --

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.136
millions of dollars started to flow.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.536
That was the missing piece!"

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.056
No one's ever said that, right?

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.576
There's actually physical manifestations
that we probably see in ourselves

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.856
by being micromanaged.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.936
Think about the most tired
you've ever been in your life, right?

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.536
It probably wasn't when
you stayed the latest at work,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.096
or it wasn't when you
came home from a road trip,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.616
it was probably when you had someone
looking over your shoulder,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.480
watching your each and every move.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.856
Kind of like my mother-in-law
when she's over right?

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.896
(Laughter)

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.616
I'm like, "I got this," you know?

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.776
And so there's actually
data to support this.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.776
There was a recent study in the UK.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.936
They took 100 hospital employees,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.616
put an activity tracker on them

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.056
and then let them go about
their next 12-hour shift all alone,

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.056
just a regular 12-hour shift.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.616
At the end of the shift,
they asked them, "Do you feel fatigued?"

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.096
And what they found
was actually really interesting.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.536
It wasn't necessarily
the people who moved the most

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.936
that felt the most fatigued,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.240
but it was the folks
that didn't have control over their jobs.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.456
So if we know that micromanagement
isn't really effective,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.256
why do we do it?

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.976
Is it that the definition is wrong?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.416
I posited that micromanagement

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.456
is just bringing in great,
wonderful, imaginative people

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.936
and then crushing their souls,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.936
so is it that we actually want to hire --

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.336
deep down inside of us --

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.200
dull and unimaginative people?

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.136
It's one of those questions
you probably don't even need to ask.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.336
It's like, "Do you want to get
your luggage stolen at the airport?"

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.576
Probably not, but I've never
been asked, right?

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.015
So has anyone asked you, as a manager,

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:22.856
"Do you want to hire
dull and unimaginative people?"

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.816
So, I don't know, this is TED,
we better back it up with data.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.576
We actually asked hundreds
of people around the country --

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.600
hundreds of managers across the country --

00:02:30.624 --> 00:02:33.184
do you want to hire
dull and unimaginative people?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.856
Alright, it's an interesting question.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.536
Well, interesting results as well.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.816
So, 94% said no --

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.056
(Laughter)

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.976
we don't want to hire
dull and unimaginative people.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.576
Six percent probably didn't
understand the question --

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.296
(Laughter)

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.576
but, bless their hearts,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.536
maybe they do just want to hire
dull and unimaginative people.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.256
But 94 percent said they did not,
and so why do we do this still then?

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.896
Well, I posit that it's something
really, really simple

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.656
that all of us deep down inside know
and have actually felt.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.776
So when we get hired
into an organization --

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.856
it could be a club,
it could be a law firm,

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.256
it could be a school organization,
it could be anything --

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.096
no one ever jumps to the top
of the totem pole, right?

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.936
You start at the very bottom.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.176
Doing what?

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.416
Doing work.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.776
You actually do the work, right?

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.896
And if you're really good
at doing the work,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.376
what do you get rewarded with?

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.616
More work, right?

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.336
Yeah, that's right, you guys
are all great micromanagers.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.616
(Laughter)

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.896
You do more work,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.296
and then pretty soon,
if you're really good at it,

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.976
you do a little bit of work still,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.656
but actually, you start to manage
people doing the work.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.776
And if you're really good at that,
what happens after that?

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.296
You start managing the people
who manage the people doing the work,

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.256
and it's at that point in time,

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.416
you start to lose control
over the output of your job.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.496
I've actually witnessed this firsthand.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.936
So, I started a company
called Boxed in our garage,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.656
and this was it --
I know it doesn't seem like much --

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.816
you know, there's a pressure
washer in the back --

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.616
this is "living the dream."

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.296
And my wife was really proud of me
when we started this,

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.896
or that's what she said,
she was really proud of me --

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.336
and so she would give me a hug,
and I'm pretty sure she had her phone up

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.296
and she was thinking,
"Oh, is John from Harvard still single?"

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.376
It was kind of like a lemonade stand
gone wrong in the beginning,

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.616
but we actually went up and said
mobile commerce is going to be big,

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.856
and actually consumer packaged goods
were going to change over time,

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.256
so let's take these big, bulky packs
that you don't want to lug home --

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.696
so not the two-pack
of Oreo cookies but the 24-pack

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.696
and not the 24-pack
of toilet paper but the 48-pack --

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.576
and let's ship it to you
much like a warehouse club would do

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.336
except they wouldn't ship it to you.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.936
So that's what we basically did.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.376
We had a really slow printer

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.976
and what we did was actually say,
"OK, this printer is taking forever, man.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.656
Let's scribble something
that would delight the customer

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.176
on the back of these invoices."

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.336
So we'd say, "Hey,
keep smiling," you know?

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.936
"Hey, you're awesome,"

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.416
or, "Hey, enjoy the Doritos,"

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.416
or, "We love Gatorade, too."

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.776
Stuff like that.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.256
And so it started breaking up
the monotony of the job as well

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.656
because I was picking
and packing all of the boxes,

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.856
and that's all you basically do
for eight, nine, 10, 12 hours a day

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.536
when you're sitting in the garage.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.376
And so an interesting thing happened.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.360
So we actually started to grow.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.376
And so, you know, over the last --

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.736
actually just even 36 months after that,

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.016
we ended up selling hundreds
of millions of dollars worth of stuff,

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.576
and we actually grew
really, really quickly.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.256
But during that time,
my role started to change, too.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.776
So, yes, I was the CEO in the garage;

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.976
I was picking and packing,
doing all the work,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.216
but then I graduated

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.976
to actually managing the people
who picked and packed,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.976
and then pretty soon I managed the people

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.056
who managed the people
picking and packing.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.456
And even now, I manage the C-staff
who manage the departments

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.856
who manage the people who manage
the people picking and packing.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.856
And it is at that point
in time, I lost control.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.536
So I thought, OK, we were delighting
all of these customers with these notes.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.176
They loved them, but I can't
write these notes anymore,

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.816
so you know what I'm going to do?

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.816
I'm going to tell these folks
how to write these notes.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.776
What pen to use, what color to use,
what you should write,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.136
what font you should use,

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.656
don't mess up the margins,

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.056
this has to be this big,
this has to be that big.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.576
And pretty soon this goal
of raising morale

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.136
by breaking up the monotony
in the fulfillment center

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.466
actually became micromanagement,
and people started complaining to HR.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.536
It's like, "Dude, this CEO guy
has got to get out of my hair, OK?

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.176
I know how to write a damn note."

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.216
(Laughter)

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.496
So it was at that point in time,
we said, "OK, you know?

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.696
We hired these great, wonderful people,

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.456
let's give them the mission
that's 'delight the customer,'

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.176
let's give them the tool to do so,
and that's these notes -- have at it."

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.616
And so what we found
was actually pretty startling.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.296
Some folks actually took the notes

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.296
and actually started drawing
these really ornate minimurals on them.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.936
When folks ordered diapers,
you'd get really fun notes like this:

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.536
"Say 'hi' to the baby for us!"

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.456
And you know, the next size up,
if they bought a bigger size,

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.816
they'd write, "Growing up so fast."

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.480
And so people really, really took to it.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.616
But it was at that time that it also
went off the rails a few times.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.616
And so we had someone just writing,
"Thx, thx," all the time,

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.736
and it's like, "Alright, dude,
my boss used to write that to me,"

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.016
so, let's not write "Thx" anymore.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.656
But you also had interesting
things on the other side.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.576
People got a little too creative.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.216
And so, like I said before,
we sell everything in bulk:

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.696
the big packs of diapers,
big packs of toilet paper,

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.016
the big packs of Doritos and Oreo cookies.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.336
We also sell the big packs
of contraception,

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.696
and so --

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.416
this is getting a little hairy.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.656
(Laughter)

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.656
So we sell the 40-pack of condoms, right?

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.136
We're all adults in this room --
40-pack of condoms.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.136
So, someone ordered
four 40-packs of condoms --

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.376
(Laughter)

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.456
And that's all they ordered,

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.576
so, 160 condoms,

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.336
the packer was like,
"I know how to delight the customer."

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.976
(Laughter)

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.616
"This guy ..."

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.576
This is what they wrote:

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.216
[Everyone loves an optimist]

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.456
(Laughter)

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.096
(Applause)

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.696
We didn't know whether to fire him
or to promote him, but he's still there.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.496
So, "Everyone loves an optimist."

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.656
But here is where it went
a little bit off the rails

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.656
and I felt a little bit
conflicted in all of this.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.336
And --

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.936
oh, there's a really bad typo --

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.656
so if there was only a red T-E-D on stage
that I counted on being here,

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.216
it wouldn't be a typo, right?

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.256
(Laughter)

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.816
(Applause)

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.136
I promised you I had
a really bad sense of humor,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.536
and now I'm gratifying that.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.096
So I told you. But I really
was conflicted, right?

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.296
At this point in time,
we started doing things

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.496
that actually weren't part
of our core mission

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.616
and people started failing at it.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.976
And so, I thought,
should we let them fail?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.880
Should we continue to let them do this?

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.895
I don't know --

00:08:46.919 --> 00:08:48.655
I didn't know at that moment,

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:50.456
but I thought this:

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.440
Is failure really that bad?

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.416
I'm not saying
we should celebrate failure.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:59.096
There's a lot of talk in Silicon Valley
that says, "Let's celebrate failure."

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.496
No, I don't know
if we would go all the way there,

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.376
because like, in our board meetings,

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.776
our board members are never like,
"Hey, Chieh, you failed last quarter,

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.176
keep doing that, buddy, OK?"

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.456
No one's ever said that.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.576
If you're part of
an organization like that,

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.936
give me a call, I want
to sit in on that meeting.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.616
In private, I don't think
many people celebrate failure,

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.216
but failure, I posit,
is actually pretty necessary

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.416
for the folks truly in the long-term,

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.216
for the smart and imaginative people

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.096
truly trying to fulfill the mission
that you give them at hand.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.136
And so failure can actually
be seen as a milestone

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.840
along that mission towards success.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.496
And if the downside of not micromanaging

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.856
is potentially this perceived notion
that you might fail more often,

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.136
and if it's really not that bad,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.376
what is the upside?

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.656
Well, we saw the upside
and it's pretty great.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.296
We tasked our engineers and said,

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.936
"Hey, some of our fulfillment centers
cost millions of dollars to build,

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.896
there's miles and miles of conveyor,

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.576
and so, can you do the same thing,

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.736
can you make them efficient
without spending millions of dollars?"

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.016
So, they got to work:

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.456
they actually did this --
this is not photoshopped,

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.016
the guy is really grinding.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.976
They built an autonomous guided vehicle.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.976
We didn't tell them what to build,
what format it needed to be.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.136
In 90 days they produced
the first prototype:

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.256
powered off Tesla batteries,
stereoscopic cameras, lidar systems.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.976
It basically replicates
the efficiency of a conveyor belt

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.256
without the actual capex
of a conveyor belt.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.616
So it doesn't actually
just stop with engineers.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.976
Our marketing department --

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.256
we told them, "Hey,
get the word out; do the right thing."

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.256
We have this wonderful lady, Nitasha,
on the marketing team.

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.736
She stopped me in the morning,

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.496
she's like, "Chieh, what are
we doing about the pink tax?"

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.336
I went and got my coffee, I sat down,

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.496
I said, "OK, Nitasha,
what is this pink tax?"

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.576
And so she told me,
it's really interesting.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.456
So, some of you might know
that in 32 states across America,

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.656
we actually charge a luxury goods tax
on women's products

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.056
like feminine care products,

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.616
so tampons and pads
are taxed like luxury goods items.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.456
So I would never dare call my wife --

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.976
or if she called me and said, "Hey, hon,
bring some pads on the way home,"

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.736
and I said, "Babe, you know,
there's a trade war going on,

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.136
the economy's not that good,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.976
so no luxury goods this month
but next month I promise --

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.016
(Laughter)

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.296
I'll take a look at it."

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.056
I'd be single pretty quickly, right?

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.776
But what's super interesting is now --

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.416
we didn't tell them what to do --

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.816
but now, working with finance,
they rebate the tax

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.336
back to customers all around the country
that we unfairly have to collect.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.816
And so at this point in time,
you might be thinking,

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.776
"OK, what is the real, real upside
of not micromanaging?"

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.456
and it's this:

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.136
I didn't do any of these projects.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.416
I didn't make the AGV.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.856
I didn't do the "Rethink
the Pink Tax" campaign.

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.096
I didn't do any of this,

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.576
but I'm standing here on a TED stage
taking all the credit for it.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.840
(Laughter)

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.576
"This guy does nothing
and takes all the credit for it.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.056
He's a real CEO, this guy.
He's really got it down."

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.296
(Laughter)

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.056
But the reality is this.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.496
I don't have the CEO thing down
100 percent pat,

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:52.136
but I've actually learned
the most fundamentally challenging lesson

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.616
I've ever had to learn,

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.176
and that's this.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.816
There is only one solution
to micromanagement ...

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.296
and that's to trust.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.536
Thank you.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.760
(Applause)
