00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.936
So the first antidepressants
were made from, of all things,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.119
rocket fuel, left over after World War II.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.896
Which is fitting, seeing as today,
one in five soldiers develop depression,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.440
or post-traumatic stress disorder or both.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.976
But it's not just soldiers
that are at high risk for these diseases.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.536
It's firefighters, ER doctors,
cancer patients, aid workers, refugees --

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.480
anyone exposed to trauma
or major life stress.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.856
And yet, despite how commonplace
these disorders are,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.496
our current treatments,
if they work at all,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.200
only suppress symptoms.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.696
In 1798, when Edward Jenner
discovered the first vaccine --

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.416
it happened to be for smallpox --

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.136
he didn't just discover
a prophylactic for a disease,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.256
but a whole new way of thinking:

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.976
that medicine could prevent disease.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.096
However, for over 200 years,

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.136
this prevention was not believed
to extend to psychiatric diseases.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.336
Until 2014, when my colleague and I
accidentally discovered

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.560
the first drugs that might prevent
depression and PTSD.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.176
We discovered the drugs in mice,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.016
and we're currently studying
whether they work in humans.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.936
And these preventative
psychopharmaceuticals

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.776
are not antidepressants.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.816
They are a whole new class of drug.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.136
And they work by increasing
stress resilience,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.656
so let's call them resilience enhancers.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.496
So think back to a stressful time
that you've since recovered from.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.616
Maybe a breakup or an exam,
you missed a flight.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.056
Stress resilience
is the active biological process

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.016
that allows us
to bounce back after stress.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.496
Similar to if you have a cold
and your immune system fights it off.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.336
And insufficient resilience

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.976
in the face of a significant
enough stressor,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.696
can result in a psychiatric disorder,
such as depression.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.576
In fact, most cases
of major depressive disorder

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.680
are initially triggered by stress.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.856
And from what we've seen so far in mice,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.976
resilience enhancers can protect
against purely biological stressors,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.736
like stress hormones,

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.840
and social and psychological stressors,
like bullying and isolation.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.696
So here is an example where we gave mice

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.240
three weeks of high levels
of stress hormones.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.896
So, in other words, a biological stressor
without a psychological component.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.136
And this causes depressive behavior.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.496
And if we give three weeks
of antidepressant treatment beforehand,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.400
it has no beneficial effects.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.576
But a single dose of a resilience
enhancer given a week before

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.120
completely prevents
the depressive behavior.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.896
Even after three weeks of stress.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.976
This is the first time
a drug has ever been shown

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.120
to prevent the negative effects of stress.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.600
Depression and PTSD are chronic,
often lifelong, clinical diseases.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.736
They also increase the risk
of substance abuse, homelessness,

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.416
heart disease, Alzheimer's, suicide.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.920
The global cost of depression alone
is over three trillion dollars per year.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.696
But now, imagine a scenario
where we know someone is predictively

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.760
at high risk for exposure
to extreme stress.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.120
Say, a red cross volunteer
going into an earthquake zone.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.736
In addition to the typhoid vaccine,

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.256
we could give her a pill or an injection
of a resilience enhancer

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.936
before she leaves.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.216
So when she is held at gunpoint
by looters or worse,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.256
she would at least be protected
against developing depression or PTSD

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.816
after the fact.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.656
It won't prevent her
from experiencing the stress,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.256
but it will allow her to recover from it.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.416
And that's what's revolutionary here.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.416
By increasing resiliency,

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.376
we can dramatically reduce
her susceptibility to depression and PTSD,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.880
possibly saving her from losing her job,
her home, her family or even her life.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.376
After Jenner discovered
the smallpox vaccine,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.720
a lot of other vaccines rapidly followed.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.736
But it was over 150 years

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.360
before a tuberculosis vaccine
was widely available.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.400
Why?

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.096
In part because society believed

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.200
that tuberculosis made people more
sensitive and creative and empathetic.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.240
And that it was caused
by constitution and not biology.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.320
And similar things are still said
today about depression.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.496
And just as Jenner's discovery
opened the door

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.800
for all of the vaccines
that followed after,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.376
the drugs we've discovered
open the possibility of a whole new field:

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.880
preventative psychopharmacology.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.296
But whether that's 15 years away,

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.416
or 150 years away,

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.456
depends not just on the science,

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.560
but on what we as a society
choose to do with it.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.536
Thank you.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.000
