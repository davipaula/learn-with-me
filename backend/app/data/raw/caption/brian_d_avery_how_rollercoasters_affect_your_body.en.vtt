00:00:06.941 --> 00:00:12.241
In the summer of 1895, 
crowds flooded the Coney Island boardwalk

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:16.055
to see the latest marvel 
of roller coaster technology:

00:00:16.055 --> 00:00:18.383
the Flip Flap Railway.

00:00:18.383 --> 00:00:21.961
This was America’s first-ever looping coaster

00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:24.827
– but its thrilling flip came at a price.

00:00:24.827 --> 00:00:28.114
The ride caused numerous cases of 
severe whiplash,

00:00:28.114 --> 00:00:31.195
neck injury and even ejections,

00:00:31.195 --> 00:00:33.717
all due to its signature loop.

00:00:33.717 --> 00:00:37.464
Today, coasters can pull off 
far more exciting tricks,

00:00:37.464 --> 00:00:40.863
without resorting to the “thrill” 
of a hospital visit.

00:00:40.863 --> 00:00:44.263
But what exactly are roller coasters 
doing to your body,

00:00:44.263 --> 00:00:48.739
and how have they managed to get scarier
and safer at the same time?

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.010
At the center of every roller coaster 
design is gravity.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.272
Unlike cars or transit trains,

00:00:55.272 --> 00:00:58.264
most coasters are propelled around their tracks

00:00:58.264 --> 00:01:01.960
almost entirely by gravitational energy.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.859
After the coaster crests the initial lift hill,

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:08.178
it begins an expertly engineered cycle –

00:01:08.178 --> 00:01:13.757
building potential energy on ascents
and expending kinetic energy on descents.

00:01:13.757 --> 00:01:16.171
This rhythm repeats throughout the ride,

00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:19.420
acting out the coaster engineer’s
choreographed dance

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.611
of gravitational energy.

00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:26.430
But there’s a key variable in this cycle
that wasn’t always so carefully considered:

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.536
you.

00:01:27.536 --> 00:01:29.048
In the days of the Flip-Flap,

00:01:29.048 --> 00:01:32.167
ride designers were most concerned 
with coasters getting stuck

00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:34.092
somewhere along the track.

00:01:34.092 --> 00:01:36.582
This led early builders to overcompensate,

00:01:36.582 --> 00:01:38.499
hurling trains down hills

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:41.442
and pulling on the brakes 
when they reached the station.

00:01:41.442 --> 00:01:45.705
But as gravity affects the cars, 
it also affects the passengers.

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:48.036
And under the intense conditions
of a coaster,

00:01:48.036 --> 00:01:50.690
gravity’s effects are multiplied.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.004
There’s a common unit used by jet pilots,

00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:53.845
astronauts,

00:01:53.845 --> 00:01:57.055
and coaster designers called “g force”.

00:01:57.055 --> 00:02:01.662
One G force is the familiar tug of gravity
you feel when standing on Earth

00:02:01.662 --> 00:02:05.723
– this is the force of Earth’s 
gravitational pull on our bodies.

00:02:05.723 --> 00:02:08.687
But as riders accelerate and decelerate,

00:02:08.687 --> 00:02:12.505
they experience more or less 
gravitational force.

00:02:12.505 --> 00:02:17.235
Modern ride designers know that the 
body can handle up to roughly 5 Gs,

00:02:17.235 --> 00:02:22.533
but the Flip-Flap and its contemporaries 
routinely reached up to 12 Gs.

00:02:22.533 --> 00:02:24.889
At those levels of gravitational pressure,

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:27.917
blood is sent flying from your brain
to your feet,

00:02:27.917 --> 00:02:30.208
leading to light-headedness or blackouts

00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:32.952
as the brain struggles to stay conscious.

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:38.376
And oxygen deprivation in the retinal cells
impairs their ability to process light,

00:02:38.376 --> 00:02:41.965
causing greyed out vision or temporary blindness.

00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:45.779
If the riders are upside down,
blood can flood the skull,

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:49.817
causing a bout of crimson vision
called a “redout”.

00:02:49.817 --> 00:02:53.486
Conversely, negative G’s 
create weightlessness.

00:02:53.486 --> 00:02:54.391
Within the body,

00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:57.088
short-term weightlessness
is mostly harmless.

00:02:57.088 --> 00:02:59.620
It can contribute to a rider’s 
motion sickness

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.254
by suspending the fluid in 
their inner ears

00:03:02.254 --> 00:03:03.766
which coordinates balance.

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:05.327
But the bigger potential danger

00:03:05.327 --> 00:03:06.393
– and thrill –

00:03:06.393 --> 00:03:09.516
comes from what ride designers 
call airtime.

00:03:09.516 --> 00:03:13.049
This is when riders typically
experience seat separation,

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.840
and, without the proper precautions,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.943
ejection.

00:03:15.943 --> 00:03:18.654
The numerous belts and harnesses 
of modern coasters

00:03:18.654 --> 00:03:20.612
have largely solved this issue,

00:03:20.612 --> 00:03:24.059
but the passenger’s ever-changing position
can make it difficult

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:26.926
to determine what needs to be 
strapped down.

00:03:26.926 --> 00:03:29.718
Fortunately, modern ride designers
are well aware

00:03:29.718 --> 00:03:31.416
of what your body, and the coaster,

00:03:31.416 --> 00:03:32.535
can handle.

00:03:32.535 --> 00:03:36.072
Coaster engineers play these competing 
forces against each other,

00:03:36.072 --> 00:03:40.418
to relieve periods of intense pressure
with periods of no pressure at all.

00:03:40.418 --> 00:03:43.658
And since a quick transition from 
positive to negative G-force

00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:47.212
can result in whiplash, headaches, 
and back and neck pain,

00:03:47.212 --> 00:03:50.635
they avoid the extreme changes
in speed and direction

00:03:50.635 --> 00:03:53.604
so common in thrill rides of old.

00:03:53.604 --> 00:03:56.414
Modern rides are also much sturdier,

00:03:56.414 --> 00:03:59.974
closely considering the amount
of gravity they need to withstand.

00:03:59.974 --> 00:04:03.269
At 5 G’s, your body feels 5 times heavier;

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.938
so if you weigh 100lbs,

00:04:04.938 --> 00:04:08.419
you’d exert the weight of 500 lbs
on the coaster.

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:11.190
Engineers have to account for 
the multiplied weight

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.261
of every passenger when designing 
a coaster’s supports.

00:04:15.261 --> 00:04:17.687
Still, these rides aren’t for everyone.

00:04:17.687 --> 00:04:21.580
The floods of adrenaline, 
light-headedness, and motion sickness

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.660
aren’t going anywhere soon.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.446
But today’s redundant restraints, 
3D modeling and simulation software

00:04:28.446 --> 00:04:32.317
have made roller coasters safer 
and more thrilling than ever.

00:04:32.317 --> 00:04:34.632
Our precise knowledge about the 
limits of the human body

00:04:34.632 --> 00:04:38.657
have helped us build coasters that are 
faster, taller, and loopier

00:04:38.657 --> 00:04:41.346
– and all without going off the rails.
