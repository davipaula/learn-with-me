00:00:12.875 --> 00:00:15.833
It was about two years
after Hurricane Katrina

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:18.667
that I first saw the Louisiana flood maps.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.268
These flood maps are used
to show land loss in the past

00:00:23.292 --> 00:00:25.851
and land loss that is to come.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:28.976
On this particular day,
at a community meeting,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.101
these maps were used to explain

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:35.476
how a 30-foot tidal surge
that accompanied Hurricane Katrina

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.851
could flood communities like mine
in south Louisiana

00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:42.167
and communities across
the Mississippi and Alabama coast.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:47.667
It turns out that the land we were losing
was our buffer from the sea.

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:52.559
I volunteered to interact
with the graphics on the wall,

00:00:52.583 --> 00:00:56.292
and in an instant my life changed
for the second time in two years.

00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:02.059
The graphic showed
massive land loss in south Louisiana

00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:04.184
and an encroaching sea,

00:01:04.208 --> 00:01:10.809
but more specifically, the graphic showed
the disappearance of my community

00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:14.000
and many other communities
before the end of the century.

00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:17.684
I wasn't alone at the front of the room.

00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:22.101
I was standing there with other members
of south Louisiana's communities --

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:25.000
black, Native, poor.

00:01:25.792 --> 00:01:30.143
We thought we were just bound
by temporary disaster recovery,

00:01:30.167 --> 00:01:34.059
but we found that we were now bound
by the impossible task

00:01:34.083 --> 00:01:38.226
of ensuring that our communities
would not be erased by sea level rise

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.583
due to climate change.

00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:46.309
Friends, neighbors, family, my community:

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:48.958
I just assumed it would always be there.

00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:54.893
Land, trees, marsh, bayous:

00:01:54.917 --> 00:01:59.018
I just assumed that it would be there
as it had been for thousands of years.

00:01:59.042 --> 00:02:00.292
I was wrong.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.851
To understand what was happening
to my community,

00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:07.851
I had to talk to other communities
around the globe.

00:02:07.875 --> 00:02:11.268
I started in south Louisiana
with the United Houma Nation.

00:02:11.292 --> 00:02:15.184
I talked to youth advocates
in Shishmaref, Alaska.

00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:18.684
I talked to fisherwomen
in coastal Vietnam,

00:02:18.708 --> 00:02:21.226
justice fighters in Fiji,

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.434
new generations of leaders

00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:26.643
in the ancient cultures
of the Torres Straits.

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:30.768
Communities that had been here
for thousands of years

00:02:30.792 --> 00:02:32.643
were suffering the same fate,

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:36.833
and we were all contemplating
how we would survive the next 50.

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:41.309
By the end of the next century,

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:44.059
it's predicted that
more than 180 million people

00:02:44.083 --> 00:02:46.476
will be displaced due to climate change,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.184
and in south Louisiana,

00:02:48.208 --> 00:02:51.851
those who can afford to do so
are already moving.

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:54.851
They're moving because
south Louisiana is losing land

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:57.208
at one of the fastest rates on the planet.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.059
Disappearance is what my bayou community

00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:03.958
has in common with
other coastal communities.

00:03:04.708 --> 00:03:08.768
Erasure is what communities
around the globe are fighting

00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:11.750
as we get real about
the impacts of climate change.

00:03:13.208 --> 00:03:16.518
I've spent the last 14 years
advocating on behalf of communities

00:03:16.542 --> 00:03:19.601
that have been directly impacted
by the climate crisis.

00:03:19.625 --> 00:03:21.934
These communities
are fighting discrimination

00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.809
within climate disaster recovery,

00:03:24.833 --> 00:03:28.768
and they're also trying to balance
mass displacement of people

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:30.601
with an influx of others

00:03:30.625 --> 00:03:33.000
who see opportunity in starting anew.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.268
Since 2005, people
have been called "refugees"

00:03:39.292 --> 00:03:42.476
when they leave when they're displaced
by climate disaster,

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.976
even when they don't cross
international borders.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.976
These terms, these misused terms,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.934
that are meant to identify the other,

00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:54.708
the victim,

00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:57.934
the person who is not supposed to be here,

00:03:57.958 --> 00:03:59.934
these terms are barriers

00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.226
to economic recovery,

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.268
to social integration

00:04:04.292 --> 00:04:08.458
and to the healing required from
the climate crisis and climate trauma.

00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:11.351
Words matter.

00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:14.375
It also matters how we treat
people who are crossing borders.

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:19.101
We should care about how people
who are crossing borders today

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:21.934
to seek refuge and safety
are being treated,

00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:26.268
if for no other reason than it might
be you or someone you love

00:04:26.292 --> 00:04:29.934
who needs to exercise
their human right to migrate

00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:31.250
in the nearby future.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.809
We must start preparing
for global migration today.

00:04:35.833 --> 00:04:37.542
It's a reality now.

00:04:38.917 --> 00:04:41.684
Our cities and our communities
are not prepared.

00:04:41.708 --> 00:04:44.851
In fact, our economic system
and our social systems

00:04:44.875 --> 00:04:49.184
are only prepared to make profit
off of people who migrate.

00:04:49.208 --> 00:04:54.726
This will cause rounds
of climate gentrification,

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.559
and it will also penalize
the movement of people,

00:04:58.583 --> 00:05:00.893
usually through exploited labor

00:05:00.917 --> 00:05:03.208
and usually through criminalization.

00:05:04.542 --> 00:05:08.393
Climate gentrification that happens
in anticipation of sea level rise

00:05:08.417 --> 00:05:11.101
is what we're seeing in places like Miami,

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:14.226
where communities
that were kept from the waterfront

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.893
are now being priced out
of the high ground

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:19.684
where they were placed originally

00:05:19.708 --> 00:05:22.018
as people move away from the coast.

00:05:22.042 --> 00:05:24.643
These folks are being moved,
forced to relocate away

00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:27.792
from the social and economic systems
that they need to survive.

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:34.833
Climate gentrification also happens
in the aftermath of climate disaster.

00:05:35.542 --> 00:05:38.059
When massive amounts
of people leave a location

00:05:38.083 --> 00:05:40.268
for an indefinite amount of time,

00:05:40.292 --> 00:05:42.601
we see others come in.

00:05:42.625 --> 00:05:45.184
We also see climate gentrification happen

00:05:45.208 --> 00:05:49.643
when damaged homes are now "green built,"

00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:51.643
but now have a higher value,

00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:55.184
generally outside of the reach
of black and brown and poor people

00:05:55.208 --> 00:05:56.458
who want to return home.

00:05:57.667 --> 00:06:01.809
The price difference in rents
or the ownership of a house

00:06:01.833 --> 00:06:05.726
is the difference between
being able to practice your right,

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.101
your human right
to return home as a community,

00:06:09.125 --> 00:06:12.143
or be forced to resettle somewhere else

00:06:12.167 --> 00:06:13.643
less climate resilient,

00:06:13.667 --> 00:06:15.101
less expensive

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:16.375
and alone.

00:06:17.458 --> 00:06:20.726
The climate crisis
is a much larger conversation

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.101
than reducing CO2 emissions,

00:06:23.125 --> 00:06:27.268
and it is a much different conversation
than just extreme weather.

00:06:27.292 --> 00:06:31.583
We're facing a shift
in every aspect of our global reality.

00:06:32.292 --> 00:06:35.393
And climate migration
is just one small part,

00:06:35.417 --> 00:06:37.476
but it's going to have ripple effects

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.750
in both coastal cities
and cities in the interior.

00:06:41.458 --> 00:06:43.018
So what do we do?

00:06:43.042 --> 00:06:44.393
I have a few ideas.

00:06:44.417 --> 00:06:46.184
(Laughter)

00:06:46.208 --> 00:06:50.893
First, we must reframe
our understanding of the problem.

00:06:50.917 --> 00:06:53.768
Climate change is not the problem.

00:06:53.792 --> 00:06:57.559
Climate change
is the most horrible symptom

00:06:57.583 --> 00:06:59.684
of an economic system

00:06:59.708 --> 00:07:02.101
that has been built for a few

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:07.684
to extract every precious value
out of this planet and its people,

00:07:07.708 --> 00:07:09.476
from our natural resources

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.726
to the fruits of our human labor.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.684
This system has created this crisis.

00:07:14.708 --> 00:07:17.375
(Applause)

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.309
We must have the courage
to admit we've taken too much.

00:07:24.333 --> 00:07:27.184
We cannot close our eyes to the fact

00:07:27.208 --> 00:07:30.351
that the entire world is paying a price

00:07:30.375 --> 00:07:36.500
for the privilege and comfort
of just a few people on the planet.

00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:41.226
It's time for us to make
society-wide changes

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.476
to a system that incentivizes consumption

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.792
to the point of global imbalance.

00:07:47.458 --> 00:07:51.851
Our social, political and economic
systems of extraction

00:07:51.875 --> 00:07:56.268
must be transformed into systems
that regenerate the earth

00:07:56.292 --> 00:07:59.208
and advance human liberty globally.

00:08:00.042 --> 00:08:03.708
It is arrogance to think
that technology will save us.

00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:08.434
It is ego to think that we can continue

00:08:08.458 --> 00:08:12.143
this unjust and extractive approach
to living on this planet

00:08:12.167 --> 00:08:13.417
and survive.

00:08:14.458 --> 00:08:19.768
(Applause)

00:08:19.792 --> 00:08:22.726
To survive this next phase
of our human existence,

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.018
we will need to restructure
our social and economic systems

00:08:26.042 --> 00:08:28.250
to develop our collective resilience.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:34.309
The social restructuring must be
towards restoration and repair

00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:35.768
of the earth

00:08:35.792 --> 00:08:38.643
and the communities
that have been extracted from,

00:08:38.667 --> 00:08:39.934
criminalized

00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:42.208
and targeted for generations.

00:08:42.917 --> 00:08:44.726
These are the frontlines.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.792
This is where we start.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.351
We must establish a new social attitude
to see migration as a benefit,

00:08:52.375 --> 00:08:55.226
a necessity for our global survival,

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:58.167
not as a threat
to our individual privilege.

00:08:58.958 --> 00:09:03.184
Collective resilience means developing
cities that can receive people

00:09:03.208 --> 00:09:04.893
and provide housing,

00:09:04.917 --> 00:09:07.809
food, water, health care

00:09:07.833 --> 00:09:09.851
and the freedom from overpolicing

00:09:09.875 --> 00:09:11.143
for everyone,

00:09:11.167 --> 00:09:12.518
no matter who they are,

00:09:12.542 --> 00:09:13.958
no matter where they're from.

00:09:15.583 --> 00:09:19.875
What would it mean if we started
to plan for climate migration now?

00:09:20.667 --> 00:09:24.893
Sprawling cities or declining cities
could see this as an opportunity

00:09:24.917 --> 00:09:29.851
to rebuild a social infrastructure
rooted in justice and fairness.

00:09:29.875 --> 00:09:32.601
We could actually put money
into public hospitals

00:09:32.625 --> 00:09:34.101
and help them prepare

00:09:34.125 --> 00:09:36.351
for what is to come
through climate migration,

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:39.917
including the trauma
that comes with loss and relocation.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:44.059
We can invest more of our time in justice,

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:46.684
but it cannot be for temporary gain,

00:09:46.708 --> 00:09:49.143
it cannot be to help budget shortfalls,

00:09:49.167 --> 00:09:51.309
it has to be for long-term change

00:09:51.333 --> 00:09:53.893
and it has to be to advance justice.

00:09:53.917 --> 00:09:56.184
It's already possible, y'all.

00:09:56.208 --> 00:09:57.976
After Hurricane Katrina,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.976
universities and high schools
around the US took in students

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.143
to help them finish their semester
or their year without missing a beat.

00:10:06.167 --> 00:10:09.976
Those students are now
productive assets in our community,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.434
and this is what our communities,
our businesses and our institutions

00:10:13.458 --> 00:10:15.018
need to get ready for now.

00:10:15.042 --> 00:10:16.875
The time is now.

00:10:18.083 --> 00:10:21.851
So as we reframe the problem
in a more truthful way

00:10:21.875 --> 00:10:25.708
and we restructure our social systems
in a more just way,

00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:30.393
all that will be left is for us
to reindigenize ourselves

00:10:30.417 --> 00:10:33.625
and to conjure a power
of the most ancient kind.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.726
This necessarily means
that we must learn to follow --

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:43.559
not tokenize, not exotify, not dismiss --

00:10:43.583 --> 00:10:46.018
the leadership and
the traditional knowledge

00:10:46.042 --> 00:10:48.333
of a particular local place.

00:10:49.042 --> 00:10:52.768
It means that we must commit
to standards of ecological equity

00:10:52.792 --> 00:10:55.518
and climate justice and human rights

00:10:55.542 --> 00:10:57.768
as the basis, a base standard,

00:10:57.792 --> 00:10:59.143
a starting point,

00:10:59.167 --> 00:11:01.125
for where our new society is to go.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:07.601
All of this requires us to recognize
a power greater than ourselves

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:10.934
and a life longer
than the ones we will live.

00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:15.351
It requires us to believe in the things
that we are privileged enough

00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:16.750
not to have to see.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.143
We must honor the rights of nature.

00:11:21.167 --> 00:11:24.601
We must advance human rights for all.

00:11:24.625 --> 00:11:27.559
We must transform from a disposable,

00:11:27.583 --> 00:11:30.268
individual society

00:11:30.292 --> 00:11:34.143
into one that sees our collective,
long-term humanity,

00:11:34.167 --> 00:11:36.042
or else we will not make it.

00:11:37.125 --> 00:11:42.934
We must see that even the best of us
are entangled in an unjust system,

00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:45.101
and we must acknowledge

00:11:45.125 --> 00:11:47.726
that the only way you're going to survive

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.768
is for us to figure out

00:11:50.792 --> 00:11:53.583
how to reach a shared liberation together.

00:11:54.625 --> 00:11:56.101
The good news is

00:11:56.125 --> 00:11:58.476
we come from powerful people.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.268
We come from those who have,
in one way or another,

00:12:01.292 --> 00:12:04.893
survived so far to be us here today.

00:12:04.917 --> 00:12:07.309
This is reason enough to fight.

00:12:07.333 --> 00:12:09.851
And take it from
your south Louisiana friend,

00:12:09.875 --> 00:12:13.101
those hardest fights
are the ones to celebrate.

00:12:13.125 --> 00:12:18.018
Let's choose to make this next phase
of our planetary existence beautiful,

00:12:18.042 --> 00:12:19.309
and while we're at it,

00:12:19.333 --> 00:12:22.292
let's make it just and fair for everyone.

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:24.893
We can do this, y'all.

00:12:24.917 --> 00:12:26.184
We can do this,

00:12:26.208 --> 00:12:27.809
because we must.

00:12:27.833 --> 00:12:30.809
We must, or else we lose our planet

00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:32.684
and we lose ourselves.

00:12:32.708 --> 00:12:34.351
The work starts here.

00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:36.434
The work starts together.

00:12:36.458 --> 00:12:37.893
This is my offering.

00:12:37.917 --> 00:12:39.976
Thank you for receiving it. Merci.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.583
(Applause)
