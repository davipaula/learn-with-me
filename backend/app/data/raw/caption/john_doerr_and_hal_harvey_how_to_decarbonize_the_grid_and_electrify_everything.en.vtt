00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.597
John Doerr: Hello, Hal!

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:16.240
Hal Harvey: John, nice to see you.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.777
JD: Nice to see you too.

00:00:17.947 --> 00:00:20.467
HH: So John, we've got a big challenge.

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:22.567
We need to get carbon
out of the atmosphere.

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:24.097
We need to stop emitting carbon,

00:00:24.097 --> 00:00:26.127
drive it to zero by 2050.

00:00:26.127 --> 00:00:28.927
And we need to be halfway there by 2030.

00:00:28.927 --> 00:00:30.400
Where are we now?

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.431
JD: As you know,
we're dumping 55 billion tons

00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:37.390
of carbon pollution in our precious
atmosphere every year,

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.367
as if it's some kind
of free and open sewer.

00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:43.333
To get halfway to zero by 2030,

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.870
we're going to have to reduce
annual emissions

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.940
by about 10 percent a year.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.110
And we've never reduced
annual emissions in any year

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.667
in the history of the planet.

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:54.150
So let's break this down.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.113
Seventy-five percent of the emissions

00:00:56.113 --> 00:00:59.270
come from the 20 largest
emitting countries.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.557
And from four sectors of their economy.

00:01:02.557 --> 00:01:03.830
The first is grid.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.550
Second, transportation.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.077
The third from the buildings.

00:01:07.077 --> 00:01:09.477
And the fourth from industrial activities.

00:01:09.477 --> 00:01:13.623
We've got to fix all those,
at speed and at scale.

00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:15.033
HH: We do.

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:18.317
And matters are in some ways worse
than we think and some ways better.

00:01:18.317 --> 00:01:19.693
Let me start with the worse.

00:01:19.693 --> 00:01:21.367
Climate change is a wicked problem.

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:23.363
And what do I mean by wicked problem?

00:01:23.363 --> 00:01:26.680
It means it's a problem
that transcends geographic boundaries.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.443
The sources are everywhere,
and the impacts are everywhere.

00:01:29.443 --> 00:01:32.770
Although obviously some nations
have contributed much more than others.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.393
In fact, one of the terrible things
about climate change

00:01:35.393 --> 00:01:38.157
is those who contributed
least to it will be hurt the most.

00:01:38.157 --> 00:01:40.780
It's a great inequity machine.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.747
So here we have a problem
that you cannot solve

00:01:43.747 --> 00:01:46.837
within the national boundaries
of one country,

00:01:46.837 --> 00:01:49.990
and yet international institutions
are notoriously weak.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.950
So that's part of the wicked problem.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.340
The second element of the wicked problem
is it transcends normal timescales.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.157
We're used to news day by day,

00:01:59.157 --> 00:02:03.857
or quarterly reports
for business enterprises,

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:07.097
or an election cycle -- that's
about the longest we think anymore of.

00:02:07.097 --> 00:02:09.057
Climate change essentially lasts forever.

00:02:09.057 --> 00:02:11.290
When you put carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere,

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.887
it's there, or its impacts
are there, for 1,000 years.

00:02:14.887 --> 00:02:18.367
It's a gift we keep on giving
for our children, our grandchildren

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:20.717
and dozens and dozens
of generations beyond there.

00:02:20.717 --> 00:02:22.730
JD: It sounds like a tax
we keep on paying.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.831
HH: Yeah, it is. It is.

00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:25.993
You sin once, you pay forever.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.983
And then the third element
of it being a wicked problem

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:34.573
is that carbon dioxide is embedded
in every aspect of our industrial economy.

00:02:34.573 --> 00:02:37.620
Every car, and every truck,
and every airplane, and every house,

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.963
and every electrical socket,
and every industrial processes

00:02:40.963 --> 00:02:42.933
now emits carbon dioxide.

00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:44.137
JD: So what's the recipe?

00:02:44.137 --> 00:02:45.770
HH: Well, here's the shortcut.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.400
If you decarbonize the grid,
the electrical grid,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.603
and then run everything on electricity --

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:53.273
decarbonize the grid
and electrify everything --

00:02:53.273 --> 00:02:56.443
if you do those two things,
you have a zero carbon economy.

00:02:56.443 --> 00:02:59.217
Now, that would seem like a pipe dream
just a few years ago

00:02:59.217 --> 00:03:01.750
because it was expensive
to create a zero-carbon grid.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.033
But the prices of solar
and wind have plummeted.

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:06.837
Solar's now the cheapest
form of electricity on planet earth

00:03:06.837 --> 00:03:08.233
and wind is second.

00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:12.093
It means now that you can convert
the grid to zero-carbon rapidly

00:03:12.093 --> 00:03:14.500
and save consumers money along the way.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.533
So there's leverage.

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:21.150
JD: Well, I think a key question, Hal,
is do we have the technology that we need

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.267
to replace fossil fuels
to get this job done?

00:03:24.267 --> 00:03:25.967
And my answer is no.

00:03:25.967 --> 00:03:29.667
I think we're about 70,
maybe 80 percent of the way there.

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:33.400
For example, we urgently need
a breakthrough in batteries.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.633
Our batteries need to be
higher energy density.

00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:38.730
They need to have enhanced
safety, faster charging.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.167
They need to take less space
and less weight,

00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:43.967
and above all else,
they need to cost a lot less.

00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:48.593
In fact, we need new chemistries
that don't rely on scarce cobalt.

00:03:48.593 --> 00:03:51.453
And we're going to need
lots of these batteries.

00:03:51.453 --> 00:03:55.940
We desperately need much more research
in clean energy technology.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.727
The US invests about
2.5 billion dollars a year.

00:03:59.727 --> 00:04:02.210
Do you know how much
Americans spend on potato chips?

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.223
HH: No.

00:04:03.223 --> 00:04:05.252
JD: The answer is 4 billion dollars.

00:04:05.252 --> 00:04:06.994
Now, what do you think of that?

00:04:06.994 --> 00:04:08.127
HH: Upside down.

00:04:08.127 --> 00:04:09.923
But let me press a little further

00:04:09.923 --> 00:04:12.737
on a question that's fascinated me
about the Silicon Valley.

00:04:12.737 --> 00:04:15.117
So the Silicon Valley
is governed by Moore's law,

00:04:15.117 --> 00:04:17.167
where performance doubles
every 18 months.

00:04:17.167 --> 00:04:19.207
It's not really a law,
it's an observation,

00:04:19.207 --> 00:04:20.808
but be that as it may.

00:04:20.808 --> 00:04:24.119
The energy world is governed
by much more mundane laws,

00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:26.067
the laws of thermodynamics, right?

00:04:26.067 --> 00:04:28.987
It's physical stuff in the economy.

00:04:29.267 --> 00:04:32.800
Cement, trucks, factories, power plants.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.860
JD: Atoms, not bits.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.567
HH: Atoms, not bits. Perfect.

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:38.183
And the transformation
of big physical things is slower,

00:04:38.183 --> 00:04:42.333
and the margins are worse,
and often the commodities are generic.

00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:46.187
How do we stimulate
the kind of innovation in those worlds

00:04:46.187 --> 00:04:50.247
that we actually need
in order to save this planet earth?

00:04:50.247 --> 00:04:52.343
JD: Well, that's a really great question.

00:04:52.343 --> 00:04:55.840
The innovation starts with basic science
in research and development.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.840
And the American commitment to that,
while advanced on a global sense,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.847
is still paltry.

00:05:03.847 --> 00:05:05.320
It needs to be 10 times higher

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.700
than the, say, 2.5 billion per year
that we spend on clean energy R and D.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.520
But we need to go beyond R and D as well.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.453
There needs to be a kind of development,
a kind of pre-commercialization,

00:05:19.453 --> 00:05:23.724
which in the US is done
by a group called ARPA-E.

00:05:23.724 --> 00:05:26.113
Then there's the matter
of forming new companies.

00:05:26.113 --> 00:05:27.143
HH: Yes.

00:05:27.143 --> 00:05:32.133
JD: And I think entrepreneurial energy
is shifting back into that field.

00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:35.793
It's clear that it takes longer
and more capital,

00:05:35.793 --> 00:05:41.656
but you can build a really substantial
and valuable enterprise or company.

00:05:41.656 --> 00:05:42.800
HH: Yes.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.777
JD: Tesla's a prime example.
Beyond Meat is another one.

00:05:45.777 --> 00:05:48.463
And that's inspiring
entrepreneurs globally.

00:05:48.463 --> 00:05:50.100
But that's not enough.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.853
I think you need also a demand signal,
in the form of policies and purchases,

00:05:54.853 --> 00:05:59.800
from nations, like Germany did with solar,
to go make these markets happen.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.593
And so I'm, at heart, a capitalist.

00:06:02.593 --> 00:06:09.433
I think this energy crisis
is the mother of all markets.

00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:11.467
And it will take longer.

00:06:11.467 --> 00:06:17.413
But the market for electric vehicle
batteries -- 500 billion dollars a year.

00:06:17.413 --> 00:06:22.320
It's probably another 500 billion dollars
if you go to stationary batteries.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.797
I want to tell you another story
that involves policy,

00:06:25.797 --> 00:06:27.567
but importantly, plans.

00:06:27.747 --> 00:06:30.350
Now, Shenzhen is a city
of 15 million people,

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.090
an innovative city, in China.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.100
And they decided that they were
going to move to electric buses.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.767
And so they required
all buses be electric.

00:06:38.767 --> 00:06:42.447
In fact, they required parking spots
have chargers associated with them.

00:06:42.447 --> 00:06:46.750
So today, Shenzhen
has 18,000 electric buses.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.590
It has 21,000 electric taxis.

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:52.217
And this goodness didn't just happen.

00:06:52.217 --> 00:06:56.437
It was the result of a thoughtful,
written, five-year plan

00:06:56.437 --> 00:06:59.103
that isn't just
a kind of campaign promise.

00:06:59.103 --> 00:07:02.933
Executing against these plans
is how mayors get promoted, or fired.

00:07:02.933 --> 00:07:05.233
And so it's really deadly serious.

00:07:05.233 --> 00:07:08.329
It has to do with carbon,
and it has to do with health, with jobs,

00:07:08.329 --> 00:07:10.167
and with overall economic strength.

00:07:10.167 --> 00:07:16.443
The bottom line is that China today
has 420,000 electric buses.

00:07:16.443 --> 00:07:19.137
America has less than 1,000.

00:07:19.137 --> 00:07:22.607
So what other national projects are there
that you'd like to see?

00:07:22.607 --> 00:07:24.210
HH: So this is a global effort,

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.396
but not everybody's
going to do the same thing,

00:07:26.396 --> 00:07:27.773
or should do the same thing.

00:07:27.773 --> 00:07:29.207
Let me start with Norway.

00:07:29.207 --> 00:07:32.080
A country that happens to be
brilliant at offshore oil,

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.817
but also understands
the consequences of burning more oil.

00:07:34.817 --> 00:07:36.907
They realized they could
deploy their skills

00:07:36.907 --> 00:07:40.197
from their offshore oil development
into offshore wind.

00:07:40.197 --> 00:07:43.480
It's a big deal to put wind
turbines out in the ocean.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.947
The ocean, the winds are much stronger,

00:07:45.947 --> 00:07:48.583
and the winds are much more
constant, not only stronger.

00:07:48.583 --> 00:07:50.317
So it balances the grid beautifully.

00:07:50.317 --> 00:07:52.897
But it's really hard to build things
in the deep ocean.

00:07:52.897 --> 00:07:53.867
Norway's good at it.

00:07:53.867 --> 00:07:55.233
So let them take that on.

00:07:55.233 --> 00:07:56.501
JD: Are they taking it on?

00:07:56.501 --> 00:07:57.591
HH: They are actually.

00:07:57.591 --> 00:07:58.979
Yeah. It's pretty brilliant.

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:00.627
Another example: India.

00:08:00.627 --> 00:08:02.937
There are hundreds of millions
of people in India

00:08:02.937 --> 00:08:04.747
that don’t have access to electricity.

00:08:04.747 --> 00:08:07.237
With the advances in solar
and advances in batteries,

00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:09.340
there's no reason
they have to build the grid

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.450
to all those villages
that don't have a grid.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.521
Skip the steps.

00:08:12.521 --> 00:08:15.203
Skip the dirty steps. Leapfrog to clean.

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:18.833
But this all comes together,
in my opinion, in the realm of policy.

00:08:18.833 --> 00:08:21.260
We need dramatic accelerants,
is what you're saying.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:24.030
Accelerants in R and D,
but also accelerants in deployment.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.633
Deployment is innovation
because deployment drives prices down.

00:08:27.633 --> 00:08:30.130
The right policy can turn things around,

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.000
and we've seen it happen already
in the electricity sector.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.733
So electricity regulators have asked
for ever cleaner sources of electricity:

00:08:37.733 --> 00:08:40.533
more renewables,
less coal, less natural gas.

00:08:40.533 --> 00:08:41.667
And it's working.

00:08:41.667 --> 00:08:43.704
It's working pretty brilliantly, actually.

00:08:43.704 --> 00:08:45.177
But it's not enough.

00:08:45.177 --> 00:08:47.583
So the German government
recognized the possibility

00:08:47.583 --> 00:08:49.603
of driving down the price of clean energy.

00:08:49.603 --> 00:08:51.533
And so they put in orders on the books.

00:08:51.533 --> 00:08:54.950
They agreed to pay an extra price
for early phases of solar energy,

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.533
presuming the price would drop.

00:08:56.533 --> 00:08:59.693
They created the demand
signal using policy.

00:08:59.693 --> 00:09:02.633
The Chinese created
a supply signal, also using policy.

00:09:02.633 --> 00:09:06.313
They decided that solar was a strategic
part of their future economy.

00:09:06.313 --> 00:09:09.257
So you had this unwritten agreement
between the two countries,

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:11.317
one buying a lot,
the other producing a lot,

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:13.377
that helped drive
the price down 80 percent.

00:09:13.377 --> 00:09:16.100
We should be doing that
with 10 technologies, or a dozen,

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.603
around the world.

00:09:17.603 --> 00:09:19.963
We need policy as the magic sauce

00:09:19.963 --> 00:09:23.687
to go through those four sectors
in the biggest countries,

00:09:23.687 --> 00:09:24.817
in all countries.

00:09:24.817 --> 00:09:27.197
And one of the things that animates me

00:09:27.197 --> 00:09:30.913
is that this requires people
who are concerned about climate change,

00:09:30.913 --> 00:09:32.153
which should be everybody,

00:09:32.153 --> 00:09:36.227
those folks have to apply their energies
on the policies that matter

00:09:36.227 --> 00:09:38.313
with the decision-makers who matter.

00:09:38.313 --> 00:09:40.400
If you don't know
who the decision-maker is

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.850
to decarbonize the grid,

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:44.573
or to produce electric vehicles
in the policy world,

00:09:44.573 --> 00:09:46.273
you're really not in the game.

00:09:46.273 --> 00:09:48.200
JD: Hal, you're an expert in policy.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.467
I know this because I've read your book --

00:09:50.467 --> 00:09:51.490
HH: Thanks, John.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.070
JD: Designing Climate Solutions.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.447
What makes for good policy?

00:09:55.447 --> 00:09:57.040
HH: There are some secrets here,

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:00.070
and they're really important
if we want to solve climate change.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.743
Let me give you two of the secrets.

00:10:01.743 --> 00:10:03.697
First, you have to go where the tons are.

00:10:03.697 --> 00:10:04.697
JD: Follow the tons.

00:10:04.697 --> 00:10:05.707
HH: Follow the tons.

00:10:05.707 --> 00:10:07.297
And this is such an obvious idea,

00:10:07.297 --> 00:10:10.073
but it's amazing how many policies
tinker around the edges.

00:10:10.073 --> 00:10:11.123
I call it green paint.

00:10:11.123 --> 00:10:13.750
We don't need green paint.
We need green substance.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:19.467
The second thing is when you set a policy,
insist on continuous improvement.

00:10:19.467 --> 00:10:20.800
So what does that mean?

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.383
Back in 1978, Jerry Brown was the youngest
governor in California's history,

00:10:24.383 --> 00:10:26.423
and he implemented
a thermal building code,

00:10:26.423 --> 00:10:29.770
which means when you build a building,
it has to have insulation in it.

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:30.847
Pretty simple idea.

00:10:30.847 --> 00:10:32.933
But he put a trick into that law.

00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:36.723
He said every three years, the code
gets tighter, and tighter, and tighter.

00:10:36.723 --> 00:10:38.510
And how do you know how much tighter?

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:42.040
Anything that pays for itself in energy
savings gets thrown into the code.

00:10:42.283 --> 00:10:45.827
So in the intervening years,
we got better insulation,

00:10:45.827 --> 00:10:47.883
better windows, better furnaces,

00:10:47.883 --> 00:10:49.033
better roofing.

00:10:49.033 --> 00:10:50.977
Today, a new California building

00:10:50.977 --> 00:10:54.567
uses 80 percent less energy
than a pre-code building.

00:10:54.567 --> 00:10:59.347
And Jerry Brown used his legislative
bandwidth once to draft that policy

00:10:59.347 --> 00:11:01.653
that produces fruits forever.

00:11:01.653 --> 00:11:02.960
JD: He got the words right.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.373
HH: He got the words right.
Continuous improvement.

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:08.283
There's a counterexample,
which should be instructive as well.

00:11:08.283 --> 00:11:11.987
So you and I are both of an age
where we remember the first oil embargo

00:11:11.987 --> 00:11:13.600
and the energy crisis that caused

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.070
with stagnation and inflation
at the same time.

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:17.533
Gerald Ford was president.

00:11:17.533 --> 00:11:21.117
And he realized that if we could double
the fuel efficiency of new vehicles,

00:11:21.117 --> 00:11:23.420
we could cut in half their energy use.

00:11:23.733 --> 00:11:26.363
So he signed a law
to double the fuel efficiency

00:11:26.363 --> 00:11:27.933
of new vehicles sold in America,

00:11:27.933 --> 00:11:30.550
from 13 miles per gallon,
absolutely pathetic,

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:31.700
to 26 miles per gallon.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:32.967
JD: That's big.

00:11:32.967 --> 00:11:36.450
HH: It’s pathetic by today’s standards,
but it was a big deal then, right?

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.470
It was doubling.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:42.597
But by setting a number as the goal,
we created a 25-year plateau.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.867
So imagine if instead he said

00:11:45.867 --> 00:11:49.917
fuel efficiency will increase
at four percent a year forever.

00:11:49.917 --> 00:11:52.467
JD: So Hal, goals are great things.

00:11:52.467 --> 00:11:56.567
How do you find the policymakers
that set these goals?

00:11:56.567 --> 00:11:58.267
And then how do you influence them?

00:11:58.267 --> 00:12:01.217
HH: Well, so that's maybe
the most important question of all.

00:12:01.217 --> 00:12:04.533
If we have a lot of concern
about climate change,

00:12:04.533 --> 00:12:07.367
and not it's properly aimed,
it just dissipates.

00:12:07.367 --> 00:12:09.333
It's a one-day headline about a march.

00:12:09.333 --> 00:12:11.307
And that's not going to get the job done.

00:12:11.307 --> 00:12:16.033
In every sector, in every country,
there’s a decision-maker.

00:12:16.033 --> 00:12:18.733
And it’s usually not the senator
or the president.

00:12:18.733 --> 00:12:22.773
It’s usually an air quality regulator
or a public utilities commissioner.

00:12:22.773 --> 00:12:23.823
These are the people

00:12:23.823 --> 00:12:26.523
that have the secret knobs
on the energy of the economy.

00:12:26.523 --> 00:12:30.240
They're the ones that get to decide
whether we get cleaner and cleaner energy,

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.266
more and more efficient buildings,
more and more efficient cars,

00:12:33.266 --> 00:12:34.342
and so forth.

00:12:34.342 --> 00:12:38.307
JD: How many of these people are there
in an economy like the US?

00:12:38.307 --> 00:12:40.167
HH: Electric utilities are monopolies,

00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:42.497
and so they're regulated
by utilities commissions.

00:12:42.497 --> 00:12:44.540
Otherwise they'd jack up
the price too high.

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.400
Every state has a utilities commission,
a public utilities commission.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.161
These commissions
typically have five members.

00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:56.687
So that’s about 250 people in America 
who control the future of our grid.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.342
None of them's a senator.
None of them's a governor.

00:12:59.342 --> 00:13:00.680
They're appointed positions.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.394
JD: How much carbon do they control?

00:13:02.394 --> 00:13:04.457
HH: 40 percent of the carbon
in the economy.

00:13:04.457 --> 00:13:05.617
JD: Wow. 250 people.

00:13:05.617 --> 00:13:07.116
HH: 250 individuals.

00:13:07.116 --> 00:13:09.333
Now, you can narrow that down even more.

00:13:09.333 --> 00:13:12.953
So let's go for the 30 biggest states.
Because this is all about tons, right?

00:13:12.953 --> 00:13:13.967
JD: Yeah.

00:13:13.967 --> 00:13:15.867
HH: You're now down to 150 individuals.

00:13:15.867 --> 00:13:18.637
And if you're content to win votes
on a three to two basis,

00:13:18.637 --> 00:13:24.287
you're down to 90 individuals who control
almost half the carbon in the economy.

00:13:24.287 --> 00:13:27.863
How do you make sure those 90 people
vote for a clean energy grid?

00:13:28.667 --> 00:13:32.793
They have a quasi-judicial process.

00:13:32.793 --> 00:13:33.900
They hold hearings.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.433
They take evidence.

00:13:35.433 --> 00:13:40.150
They consider what they're allowed to do
within their statutory framework.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.670
And then they make a decision.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.777
They have to look at human health,
at economics, at reliability.

00:13:44.777 --> 00:13:47.557
And they have to look at greenhouse gases.

00:13:47.557 --> 00:13:49.667
JD: Is there a breakthrough
you’d like to see

00:13:49.667 --> 00:13:52.677
or an innovation 
you’re particularly excited about?

00:13:52.677 --> 00:13:55.133
HH: I'm keen on green hydrogen.

00:13:55.133 --> 00:13:57.720
I mean, we need to drive down
the cost of electrolysis,

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.017
and it's always going to be more expensive
than just pure electricity.

00:14:01.017 --> 00:14:03.737
That's a thermodynamic certainty.

00:14:03.737 --> 00:14:05.947
But once you have hydrogen,

00:14:05.947 --> 00:14:09.047
you can reform it with other
chemicals into liquid fuels,

00:14:09.047 --> 00:14:12.857
like synthetic diesel for airplanes
or long haul trucks or ships.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.830
You can use it to make fertilizers.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:18.300
And we can rethink 
the basics of chemistry.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.907
Chemistry's built on hydrocarbons,

00:14:20.907 --> 00:14:23.833
and we need to build it
on carbohydrates instead.

00:14:23.833 --> 00:14:26.557
So different kinds of molecules, 
but it’s not impossible.

00:14:26.557 --> 00:14:28.817
I guess the other thing
that’s fascinating to me

00:14:28.817 --> 00:14:32.033
is this term "stranded investment."

00:14:32.033 --> 00:14:35.500
So if you own a coal-fired power plant 
or a coal mine today,

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.273
anywhere in the world almost,
you have stranded your money.

00:14:38.273 --> 00:14:39.633
You can't get it back.

00:14:39.633 --> 00:14:41.047
Because they're uneconomic.

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:44.272
We analyzed every coal plant in America,
the economics of every one,

00:14:44.272 --> 00:14:47.860
and 75 percent of them,
it's cheaper to shut them down

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.453
and replace them with a brand new
wind or solar farm

00:14:50.453 --> 00:14:53.833
than just pay the operating costs
of that coal plant.

00:14:53.833 --> 00:14:55.597
So what's going to get stranded next?

00:14:55.597 --> 00:14:57.040
This is an important question.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.933
I think natural gas is next.

00:14:58.933 --> 00:15:01.967
It's already skidding along at low prices.

00:15:02.917 --> 00:15:06.290
I think people who are putting
a lot of money into gas fields right now,

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.723
or gas turbines right now,
are going to rue the day.

00:15:08.723 --> 00:15:11.353
John, what are some of
the innovations or breakthroughs

00:15:11.353 --> 00:15:13.113
that you’re especially excited about?

00:15:13.113 --> 00:15:17.133
JD: Well, one exciting development
comes from my friend and hero Al Gore,

00:15:17.133 --> 00:15:19.780
who has the vision 
and is working with entrepreneurs,

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:24.507
that by integrating data can produce,

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:26.973
for every place on the planet,

00:15:26.973 --> 00:15:31.333
a new real-time estimate
of what their carbon emissions are.

00:15:31.333 --> 00:15:34.270
You know, I come from the school
of measuring what matters.

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:35.291
HH: Yes you do.

00:15:35.291 --> 00:15:38.383
JD: If we had a real-time
kind of Google Earth,

00:15:38.383 --> 00:15:43.177
where we could zoom in
to individual factories, or oil fields,

00:15:43.177 --> 00:15:45.873
or Walmart stores,

00:15:45.873 --> 00:15:48.583
I think that could really change the game.

00:15:48.583 --> 00:15:51.027
I'm also a believer in carbon accounting.

00:15:51.333 --> 00:15:55.527
And so I've seen entrepreneurs
who are making systems

00:15:55.527 --> 00:15:58.663
that will allow not just the owners

00:15:58.663 --> 00:16:02.173
but all the employees
of an enterprise or organization

00:16:02.173 --> 00:16:05.113
to see what's in
their carbon supply chain.

00:16:05.113 --> 00:16:06.467
HH: Yup. Yup.

00:16:06.467 --> 00:16:08.337
JD: I'd love to see legislation

00:16:08.337 --> 00:16:13.257
that required the OMB
score every piece of legislation

00:16:13.257 --> 00:16:14.537
for its carbon impact.

00:16:14.537 --> 00:16:15.537
HH: Yes.

00:16:15.537 --> 00:16:18.810
JD: If we're serious about this,
we're going to measure what matters,

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:20.306
measure what really matters.

00:16:20.306 --> 00:16:21.303
HH: Yup. Yup.

00:16:21.303 --> 00:16:23.637
JD: So let's talk about Paris
and the Paris Accord

00:16:23.637 --> 00:16:28.023
because some people say that some
nations are ahead of their plans,

00:16:28.023 --> 00:16:29.660
but others are not,

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.977
and that the agenda
is not aggressive enough.

00:16:33.977 --> 00:16:36.157
It’s not going to get us
where we need to go.

00:16:36.157 --> 00:16:39.500
What is your view of the Paris Accords?

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.943
HH: The Paris Accords
are quite interesting animals.

00:16:42.943 --> 00:16:47.676
It’s not a national commitment
and it’s not an international commitment.

00:16:47.676 --> 00:16:48.823
JD: They're not binding.

00:16:48.823 --> 00:16:49.973
HH: They're not binding.

00:16:49.973 --> 00:16:53.233
They're individually determined
national contributions.

00:16:53.233 --> 00:16:55.933
That’s the term of art
that they use in the Paris Accord.

00:16:55.933 --> 00:16:57.254
JD: So what does that mean?

00:16:57.254 --> 00:16:58.690
HH: So that means Europe says:

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:02.040
We're going to do 40 percent
less carbon in 2030

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.817
than we did in 1990, for example.

00:17:05.817 --> 00:17:09.690
If they fail to hit that number,
there’s no consequences.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.297
If they go past that number,
there’s no consequences.

00:17:12.297 --> 00:17:15.390
That, however, does that mean
the Paris Accords are not important.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:16.610
They're really important.

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:18.377
Because they set up, I would call it,

00:17:18.377 --> 00:17:20.710
a race to the top
instead of a race to the bottom.

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:24.467
They set up a dynamic where people were
sort of bidding to do better and better.

00:17:24.467 --> 00:17:27.100
They created transparency
in how people are doing

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:29.380
in terms of their carbon emissions.

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:33.033
And there are some countries that take
these commitments very seriously,

00:17:33.033 --> 00:17:36.200
and including the European Union
and China on that list.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.193
JD: So I'm going to push on this,
and what we really need

00:17:39.193 --> 00:17:40.195
HH: Yup.

00:17:40.195 --> 00:17:42.893
is we need a plan.

00:17:42.893 --> 00:17:44.167
HH: So elaborate.

00:17:44.167 --> 00:17:48.633
JD: Well, I think what we have today
are goals, not a plan.

00:17:48.633 --> 00:17:50.267
And I think a plan

00:17:50.267 --> 00:17:56.927
would be a set of 20 focused
precision policy efforts,

00:17:56.927 --> 00:18:00.517
each of whom's targeted
at the right decision-maker or makers,

00:18:00.517 --> 00:18:04.523
in the right venues,
for these 20 largest nations,

00:18:04.523 --> 00:18:06.743
in the four sectors of their economy.

00:18:06.743 --> 00:18:10.550
And these precision campaigns
would be well-funded,

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:11.677
they'd be well-focused,

00:18:11.677 --> 00:18:14.757
they'd have an awesome founder/CEO/leader,

00:18:14.757 --> 00:18:16.313
an amazing staff of people,

00:18:16.313 --> 00:18:19.390
an accountable set of objectives
and key results,

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:20.667
and be on a timeline.

00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:23.800
We would measure their progress,
quarter by quarter.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.967
That would give me hope that we'll get
where we need to go by 2030.

00:18:27.967 --> 00:18:29.033
How about you?

00:18:29.033 --> 00:18:32.313
HH: Let me add on
a couple of characteristics

00:18:32.313 --> 00:18:34.070
to exactly what you just said.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.353
And that is you need to have
a deep understanding

00:18:36.353 --> 00:18:40.693
of who the decision-maker is,
ideally by person, certainly by position,

00:18:40.693 --> 00:18:45.100
and understand exactly what motivates them
or hinders them in making this decision

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.330
so that you can put all your forces on
the decision-maker at point of decision.

00:18:49.933 --> 00:18:54.400
It's one thing to have a general concern
about the environment or about climate.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.907
It's quite another to focus that concern

00:18:56.907 --> 00:18:59.060
on the most important
decisions on the planet.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.540
And that's what we need to do.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.714
I love this idea.

00:19:01.714 --> 00:19:04.631
JD: Okay, so focus on the decision-makers.

00:19:04.631 --> 00:19:07.977
I think there's other individual action
that we can and must take.

00:19:07.977 --> 00:19:11.167
We've got to amplify your voice

00:19:11.167 --> 00:19:15.917
so that you organize, activate,
proselytize, your company,

00:19:15.917 --> 00:19:20.003
your neighbors, youth, I think
are an incredibly powerful voice,

00:19:20.003 --> 00:19:21.383
and friends.

00:19:21.383 --> 00:19:22.383
HH: Yup.

00:19:22.383 --> 00:19:23.398
JD: You need to vote.

00:19:23.398 --> 00:19:24.413
HH: Yup.

00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:27.067
JD: You need to vote
like your life depends on it.

00:19:27.067 --> 00:19:30.367
So Hal, what does this all add up to?

00:19:30.367 --> 00:19:32.300
What's the takeaway?

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.933
HH: I'm an optimist, John.
I've seen this possible.

00:19:35.343 --> 00:19:37.637
I've seen when nations
decide to do great things,

00:19:37.637 --> 00:19:39.117
they can do great things.

00:19:39.117 --> 00:19:43.027
Think of America’s rural electrification
or the interstate highway system we built.

00:19:43.027 --> 00:19:45.568
Those are huge projects
that transformed the country.

00:19:45.568 --> 00:19:51.437
What we did prepping for World War II:
we built 300,000 airplanes in four years.

00:19:51.437 --> 00:19:53.843
So if we decide to do something,

00:19:53.843 --> 00:19:57.307
or when the Germans or the Chinese
or the Indians decide to do something,

00:19:57.307 --> 00:19:58.307
other countries,

00:19:58.307 --> 00:19:59.767
they can get it done.

00:19:59.767 --> 00:20:02.827
But if this is sort of
piffling around the edges,

00:20:02.827 --> 00:20:04.267
we won't get there.

00:20:04.267 --> 00:20:06.103
What do you think? Are you optimistic?

00:20:06.103 --> 00:20:10.833
JD: My take on this is,
I may not be optimistic, but I'm hopeful.

00:20:10.833 --> 00:20:15.807
I really think the crucial question is:
Can we do what we must,

00:20:15.807 --> 00:20:18.167
at speed and at scale?

00:20:18.167 --> 00:20:23.020
The good news is, it's now clearly cheaper
to save the planet than to ruin it.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:27.507
The bad news is,
we are fast running out of time.
