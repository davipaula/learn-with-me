00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.779
Imagine if your daily commute
involved tens of kilometers

00:00:16.803 --> 00:00:18.612
on these kinds of roads,

00:00:18.636 --> 00:00:20.210
driving this kind of vehicle,

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:23.116
without any nearby service stations
or breakdown assistance.

00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:27.382
For millions of drivers in many parts 
of Africa, this is the norm.

00:00:28.102 --> 00:00:30.950
Since over 90 percent
of passenger cars are imported,

00:00:30.974 --> 00:00:32.195
often used,

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.356
they're just not designed for local usage.

00:00:34.775 --> 00:00:37.860
High import duties
often compound the problem,

00:00:37.884 --> 00:00:39.773
sometimes doubling the price of a car.

00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:44.402
So most vehicles are either
too expensive or too unreliable

00:00:44.426 --> 00:00:46.120
for the average consumer.

00:00:46.144 --> 00:00:49.809
Well-designed vehicles are only part
of the transport challenge, though.

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:52.045
For every 100 adults in Africa,

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:54.413
less than five people
actually own a vehicle.

00:00:54.948 --> 00:00:56.466
Public transport is available,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.648
and in countries like Kenya,
it's often run by local entrepreneurs

00:00:59.672 --> 00:01:00.913
using minivans like this.

00:01:00.937 --> 00:01:03.294
But in most rural and peri-urban areas,

00:01:03.318 --> 00:01:05.503
it's fragmented and unreliable.

00:01:06.607 --> 00:01:08.614
In more remote areas without transport,

00:01:08.638 --> 00:01:11.181
people have to walk,
typically tens of kilometers,

00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:13.838
to get to school
or collect clean drinking water

00:01:13.862 --> 00:01:15.788
or buy supplies from nearby markets.

00:01:16.348 --> 00:01:19.965
Bad roads, disparate communities,
low average income levels

00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:21.147
and inadequate vehicles

00:01:21.171 --> 00:01:22.918
all impair the transport system

00:01:22.942 --> 00:01:25.605
and ultimately constrain economic output.

00:01:26.577 --> 00:01:29.811
Despite this constraint,
the Pan-African economy is booming.

00:01:29.835 --> 00:01:32.911
Combined GDP is already
over two trillion dollars.

00:01:33.518 --> 00:01:36.804
This is a massive commercial
and social opportunity,

00:01:36.828 --> 00:01:38.386
not a helpless continent.

00:01:39.016 --> 00:01:41.333
So why isn't there already
something better?

00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:45.489
Around the world, automotive
is quarter the manufacturing sector.

00:01:45.513 --> 00:01:48.435
But in Africa, it's generally
been overlooked by carmakers,

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:50.611
who are focused on larger,
established markets

00:01:50.635 --> 00:01:52.823
and emerging economies
like India and China.

00:01:53.562 --> 00:01:55.075
This lack of industrialization,

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:58.622
which itself creates a vicious-cycle
barrier to the emergence of industry,

00:01:58.646 --> 00:02:00.674
has caused the dependence on imports.

00:02:01.406 --> 00:02:03.271
There is a supply-demand disconnect,

00:02:03.295 --> 00:02:06.586
with the vast majority of automotive
spending on the continent today,

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.563
essentially funding an international
network of car exporters

00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:11.871
instead of fueling the growth
of local industry.

00:02:12.534 --> 00:02:15.261
It's entirely possible to solve
this disconnect, though,

00:02:15.285 --> 00:02:17.959
starting with products
that people actually want.

00:02:17.983 --> 00:02:20.814
And this is what motivated me
to start Mobius,

00:02:20.838 --> 00:02:23.764
to build a vehicle in Africa, for Africa.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.764
To us, this meant reimagining the car
around the needs of the consumer,

00:02:28.788 --> 00:02:31.624
simplifying nonessential features
like interior fixtures

00:02:31.648 --> 00:02:34.622
and investing in performance-critical
systems like suspension

00:02:34.646 --> 00:02:36.917
to create durable and affordable vehicles

00:02:36.941 --> 00:02:38.506
built for purpose.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.006
And built for purpose
is exactly where we started

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.481
with our first-generation
model, Mobius II,

00:02:43.505 --> 00:02:46.986
which was designed
as a really rugged, low-cost SUV,

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.757
able to handle heavy loads
and rough terrain reliably.

00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:52.913
This launched in 2015,

00:02:52.937 --> 00:02:55.418
and we've now developed
the next-generation version

00:02:55.442 --> 00:02:57.113
based on customer feedback.

00:02:57.137 --> 00:02:59.049
For high stress and heavy loading,

00:02:59.073 --> 00:03:01.456
we engineered a sturdy steel space frame.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.979
To handle acute vibration
from rough roads,

00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:05.759
we ruggedized the suspension.

00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:10.121
For potholes and uneven terrain,
high ground clearance was a no-brainer.

00:03:10.145 --> 00:03:13.672
And to make this something customers
could actually be proud to drive in,

00:03:13.696 --> 00:03:15.854
we designed an aspirational
body aesthetic.

00:03:16.463 --> 00:03:19.942
Underpinning all of this, we simplified
or eliminated components

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:22.011
like parking sensors and automatic windows

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:23.195
wherever we could,

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:24.523
to keep costs low

00:03:24.547 --> 00:03:28.454
and sell this at half the price
of a five-year-old SUV in Kenya today.

00:03:30.271 --> 00:03:31.422
The new --

00:03:31.446 --> 00:03:34.504
(Applause)

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.266
The new Mobius II launches in 2018.

00:03:38.793 --> 00:03:41.831
And while durable, affordable
vehicles like this are vital,

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:44.548
a broader solution to immobility
needs to go further.

00:03:45.304 --> 00:03:46.455
Over the last decade,

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:49.838
a transport-centric, shared economy
has connected people across Africa

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:52.253
with minivans, auto rickshaws and sedans.

00:03:52.277 --> 00:03:55.077
It's just not operated
very effectively or efficiently.

00:03:55.712 --> 00:03:58.662
Enabling better access to transport
is all about strengthening

00:03:58.686 --> 00:04:00.059
this public transit network,

00:04:00.083 --> 00:04:03.241
empowering local entrepreneurs
who already offer similar services

00:04:03.265 --> 00:04:04.444
in their communities

00:04:04.468 --> 00:04:07.531
to operate these services
more profitably and more widely.

00:04:08.221 --> 00:04:11.436
With this aim, we're taking
human-centered design a step further

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.739
and developing a transport platform model,

00:04:13.763 --> 00:04:16.097
which enables owners
to plug in different modules,

00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:18.012
like a goods cage or ambulance unit,

00:04:18.036 --> 00:04:21.108
and run other services
like goods delivery or medical transport,

00:04:21.132 --> 00:04:22.615
as well as public transport.

00:04:23.301 --> 00:04:26.859
Transportation services
like this are the fundamental driver

00:04:26.883 --> 00:04:29.665
of logistics, trade, social services,

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:32.057
access to education,
health care and employment.

00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:34.263
The transportation grid
to physical economies

00:04:34.287 --> 00:04:36.761
is akin to the internet
to virtual economies.

00:04:36.785 --> 00:04:40.317
And the impact of increased mobility
is only part of the potential here.

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:45.098
Since the late 1700s,
the Industrial Revolution has catapulted

00:04:45.122 --> 00:04:47.252
the development of economies
around the world

00:04:47.276 --> 00:04:48.747
into thriving societies.

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.712
Today, manufacturing is still the engine
of economic growth and stability,

00:04:52.736 --> 00:04:56.043
even as new technologies have inevitably
transformed the way we live.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.274
Making stuff is important,

00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.989
especially for nation-states wanting
to boost employment,

00:05:01.013 --> 00:05:03.302
increase skills and reduce
import dependence.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.633
But while few countries can skip
this industrialized stage,

00:05:06.657 --> 00:05:08.863
many have negligible manufacturing output.

00:05:09.707 --> 00:05:11.665
There are various reasons for this,

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:14.577
but one reason is universal:
hardware is hard.

00:05:14.601 --> 00:05:15.990
(Laughter)

00:05:16.768 --> 00:05:20.435
So what are the challenges to industry,
and how are we approaching them?

00:05:20.459 --> 00:05:23.475
The first issue many people think of
is a lack of skilled labor.

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:27.040
In areas where access to good primary
and secondary education are limited

00:05:27.064 --> 00:05:29.006
and employment opportunities are scarce,

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.798
a small skill base is inevitable.

00:05:31.352 --> 00:05:33.217
But that doesn't mean it's immutable.

00:05:33.634 --> 00:05:37.198
There's an abundance of smart, hardworking
and ambitious people in Africa,

00:05:37.222 --> 00:05:38.586
obviously.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.331
What's really lacking are good jobs

00:05:40.355 --> 00:05:43.739
that offer a path not just to employment
but also professional growth.

00:05:44.414 --> 00:05:47.217
The first person we employed
at Mobius over six years ago

00:05:47.241 --> 00:05:48.750
was a mechanic named Kazungu.

00:05:48.774 --> 00:05:51.238
Kazungu had gone to school
up to the age of 18

00:05:51.262 --> 00:05:52.995
and worked as an odd-job mechanic.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:56.524
Joining the company at the time
was a near-vertical learning curve.

00:05:56.548 --> 00:05:57.961
But he rose to the challenge,

00:05:57.985 --> 00:06:01.352
and with more technical guidance
from an expanding engineering team,

00:06:01.376 --> 00:06:02.597
he's grown over the years

00:06:02.621 --> 00:06:04.926
to lead a group of mechanics
in R&amp;D prototyping.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.134
A thirst for learning and the work ethic
to step up to a challenge

00:06:08.158 --> 00:06:09.740
are values we now recruit on.

00:06:09.764 --> 00:06:13.141
Pairing innate values like this
with on-the-job training and systems

00:06:13.165 --> 00:06:14.798
has strengthened our skill base.

00:06:14.822 --> 00:06:17.111
This works really well
on the production line,

00:06:17.135 --> 00:06:20.388
where work can be systematized
around clear procedural instructions

00:06:20.412 --> 00:06:22.378
and then reinforced through training.

00:06:23.053 --> 00:06:26.337
In our experience, it is possible
to build a skilled workforce,

00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:29.504
and we plan to hire hundreds more people
using this approach.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.769
A second challenge is a lack of suppliers.

00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:36.675
In countries like Kenya, there are only
a handful of automotive suppliers

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:39.803
manufacturing parts like electrical
harnesses, seats and glass.

00:06:39.827 --> 00:06:41.209
It's a burgeoning group,

00:06:41.233 --> 00:06:43.145
and without much demand from industry,

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:45.607
most of these suppliers
have no impetus to grow.

00:06:46.323 --> 00:06:49.263
We've worked hard with a few of them
to develop the capacity

00:06:49.287 --> 00:06:52.567
to consistently manufacture components
at the quality levels we need,

00:06:52.591 --> 00:06:54.155
like this supplier in Nairobi,

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:57.260
who are helping to reduce
the production cost of metal brackets

00:06:57.284 --> 00:06:59.739
and improve their ability
to build conformant parts

00:06:59.763 --> 00:07:01.164
to our engineering drawings.

00:07:01.705 --> 00:07:04.868
Supply and development is standard
practice in automotive globally,

00:07:04.892 --> 00:07:07.010
but it needs to be applied
from the ground up

00:07:07.034 --> 00:07:08.908
with a vast majority of local suppliers

00:07:08.932 --> 00:07:10.587
to properly bolster the ecosystem.

00:07:11.201 --> 00:07:14.872
And as production volumes rise,
these suppliers can employ more staff,

00:07:14.896 --> 00:07:16.427
invest in better equipment

00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:18.981
and continue to develop
new manufacturing techniques

00:07:19.005 --> 00:07:20.502
to further increase output.

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:24.637
Building up skills and suppliers
are not the only hurdles

00:07:24.661 --> 00:07:26.011
to local industrialization,

00:07:26.035 --> 00:07:29.097
but they're good examples
of how we think about the challenge.

00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:31.654
You see, we're not just
reimagining the car,

00:07:31.678 --> 00:07:34.019
we're reimagining our entire value chain.

00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:36.810
None of this has been easy,

00:07:36.834 --> 00:07:38.688
and we're only just getting started.

00:07:38.712 --> 00:07:40.817
But once African industry starts to scale,

00:07:40.841 --> 00:07:42.203
the potential is huge.

00:07:42.735 --> 00:07:44.261
Better products,

00:07:44.285 --> 00:07:45.698
costing less,

00:07:45.722 --> 00:07:46.979
built locally,

00:07:47.003 --> 00:07:49.093
together creating millions of jobs.

00:07:49.956 --> 00:07:52.662
Frugal innovation offers a path
to economic acceleration

00:07:52.686 --> 00:07:54.177
across many industries,

00:07:54.201 --> 00:07:56.507
and the future of this continent
depends on it.

00:07:57.777 --> 00:08:01.960
The Africa 2.0 I believe in
can apply locally relevant design

00:08:01.984 --> 00:08:04.542
and a commitment to solving
its industrial challenges

00:08:04.566 --> 00:08:07.419
to create a more connected,
more prosperous future,

00:08:07.443 --> 00:08:09.471
not just for the privileged few,

00:08:09.495 --> 00:08:10.941
but for everyone.

00:08:10.965 --> 00:08:12.163
Thank you.

00:08:12.187 --> 00:08:15.133
(Applause)
