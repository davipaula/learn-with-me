00:00:14.756 --> 00:00:16.217
These days scientists know

00:00:16.241 --> 00:00:18.661
how you inherit characteristics
from your parents.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:21.791
They're able to calculate probabilities
of having a specific trait

00:00:21.815 --> 00:00:23.156
or getting a genetic disease

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.430
according to the information
from the parents and the family history.

00:00:26.454 --> 00:00:27.913
But how is this possible?

00:00:27.937 --> 00:00:31.321
To understand how traits pass
from one living being to its descendants,

00:00:31.345 --> 00:00:33.536
we need to go back in time
to the 19th century

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.286
and a man named Gregor Mendel.

00:00:35.849 --> 00:00:37.869
Mendel was an Austrian monk and biologist

00:00:37.893 --> 00:00:39.591
who loved to work with plants.

00:00:39.615 --> 00:00:42.837
By breeding the pea plants
he was growing in the monastery's garden,

00:00:42.861 --> 00:00:45.108
he discovered the principles
that rule heredity.

00:00:45.132 --> 00:00:46.668
In one of most classic examples,

00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:48.875
Mendel combined
a purebred yellow-seeded plant

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.944
with a purebred green-seeded plant,

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:52.897
and he got only yellow seeds.

00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:55.357
He called the yellow-colored trait
the dominant one,

00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:57.554
because it was expressed
in all the new seeds.

00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:01.356
Then he let the new yellow-seeded
hybrid plants self-fertilize.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.500
And in this second generation,
he got both yellow and green seeds,

00:01:04.524 --> 00:01:07.683
which meant the green trait
had been hidden by the dominant yellow.

00:01:07.707 --> 00:01:09.989
He called this hidden trait
the recessive trait.

00:01:10.013 --> 00:01:11.691
From those results, Mendel inferred

00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:13.903
that each trait depends
on a pair of factors,

00:01:13.927 --> 00:01:15.562
one of them coming from the mother

00:01:15.586 --> 00:01:17.081
and the other from the father.

00:01:17.105 --> 00:01:19.416
Now we know that these factors
are called alleles

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.780
and represent the different
variations of a gene.

00:01:21.804 --> 00:01:24.633
Depending on which type of allele
Mendel found in each seed,

00:01:24.657 --> 00:01:28.231
we can have what we call a homozygous pea,
where both alleles are identical,

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:29.986
and what we call a heterozygous pea,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.732
when the two alleles are different.

00:01:31.756 --> 00:01:34.470
This combination of alleles
is known as genotype

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:36.446
and its result, being yellow or green,

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.184
is called phenotype.

00:01:38.208 --> 00:01:41.483
To clearly visualize how alleles
are distributed amongst descendants,

00:01:41.507 --> 00:01:43.526
we can a diagram
called the Punnett square.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.631
You place the different
alleles on both axes

00:01:45.655 --> 00:01:47.806
and then figure out
the possible combinations.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.813
Let's look at Mendel's peas, for example.

00:01:49.837 --> 00:01:52.883
Let's write the dominant yellow allele
as an uppercase "Y"

00:01:52.907 --> 00:01:55.471
and the recessive green allele
as a lowercase "y."

00:01:55.495 --> 00:01:58.143
The uppercase Y always
overpowers his lowercase friend,

00:01:58.167 --> 00:01:59.955
so the only time you get green babies

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.731
is if you have lowercase Y's.

00:02:02.207 --> 00:02:05.004
In Mendel's first generation,
the yellow homozygous pea mom

00:02:05.028 --> 00:02:07.422
will give each pea kid
a yellow-dominant allele,

00:02:07.446 --> 00:02:10.667
and the green homozygous pea dad
will give a green-recessive allele.

00:02:10.691 --> 00:02:13.090
So all the pea kids
will be yellow heterozygous.

00:02:13.637 --> 00:02:15.232
Then, in the second generation,

00:02:15.256 --> 00:02:17.067
where the two heterozygous kids marry,

00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:20.001
their babies could have
any of the three possible genotypes,

00:02:20.025 --> 00:02:21.728
showing the two possible phenotypes

00:02:21.752 --> 00:02:23.401
in a three-to-one proportion.

00:02:23.838 --> 00:02:25.891
But even peas have
a lot of characteristics.

00:02:25.915 --> 00:02:27.931
For example, besides
being yellow or green,

00:02:27.955 --> 00:02:29.517
peas may be round or wrinkled.

00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:31.835
So we could have all
these possible combinations:

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.590
round yellow peas, round green peas,

00:02:33.614 --> 00:02:35.632
wrinkled yellow peas, wrinkled green peas.

00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:38.538
To calculate the proportions
for each genotype and phenotype,

00:02:38.562 --> 00:02:40.105
we can use a Punnett square too.

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.514
Of course, this will make it
a little more complex.

00:02:42.538 --> 00:02:44.885
And lots of things are more
complicated than peas,

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.304
like, say, people.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.980
These days, scientists know a lot more
about genetics and heredity.

00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:53.534
And there are many other ways in which
some characteristics are inherited.

00:02:53.558 --> 00:02:55.730
But, it all started
with Mendel and his peas.
