00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.841
I used to be really bad at earning money.

00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:05.110
Early on, I was
a junior financial planner,

00:00:05.134 --> 00:00:07.573
and my job was to help people
manage their wealth.

00:00:07.597 --> 00:00:10.760
But my salary was so low
that I started riding my bike to work

00:00:10.784 --> 00:00:12.129
to save money on gas,

00:00:12.153 --> 00:00:14.631
and I started a garden
to save money on food.

00:00:14.655 --> 00:00:16.677
Now I run a bookkeeping agency

00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:19.324
that specifically serves
creative businesses.

00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:21.730
[TED: The Way We Work]

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:23.758
[Made possible
with the support of Dropbox]

00:00:23.782 --> 00:00:26.824
This might sound strange
coming from a former financial planner,

00:00:26.848 --> 00:00:28.599
but I'm not a fan of capitalism.

00:00:28.623 --> 00:00:33.738
Almost everyone I work with and know
and love is an artist, including me.

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:36.311
So I know, the way the system is set up,

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:40.178
freelancers and artists
are too often way underpaid.

00:00:40.202 --> 00:00:43.977
They often feel like focusing on money
will corrupt their creativity,

00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:47.376
or they think they're just not
that good at making money anyway.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.964
But the truth is, we can be good at it,

00:00:49.988 --> 00:00:51.293
and in fact, we have to be,

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:53.454
because our freedom is at stake:

00:00:53.478 --> 00:00:55.737
our freedom to create, to influence

00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:57.430
and to use the power of money

00:00:57.454 --> 00:01:02.190
to change the very exploitation
that keeps artists broke to begin with.

00:01:02.682 --> 00:01:04.406
I'm not struggling anymore,

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.065
and I've learned a lot
since being a financial planner,

00:01:07.089 --> 00:01:09.125
and I just wanted to share that knowledge.

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:10.923
So here's what I've learned and done.

00:01:10.947 --> 00:01:12.751
One: what you do.

00:01:12.775 --> 00:01:14.112
When it comes to your offer,

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:16.622
you have to be able
to answer the following question:

00:01:16.646 --> 00:01:18.889
Why would anyone hire you
over your competition?

00:01:18.913 --> 00:01:22.239
If you can't answer that question,
neither can your potential clients,

00:01:22.263 --> 00:01:25.899
which means you can't charge more for
the thing that makes your work special.

00:01:25.923 --> 00:01:29.366
Price becomes a differentiator,
and bidding becomes a race to the bottom.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.952
What sets you apart could be what you do,
why you do it or how you do it:

00:01:32.976 --> 00:01:35.859
a string quartet that arranges
and plays hip-hop medleys

00:01:35.883 --> 00:01:40.599
or a branding firm that has a unique way
of marketing technology to Baby Boomers

00:01:40.623 --> 00:01:42.113
or a prop and set designer

00:01:42.137 --> 00:01:45.438
who's known for crafting
beautiful papier-mâché miniatures.

00:01:45.462 --> 00:01:47.466
Two: who you do it for.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.529
After you determine what sets you apart,

00:01:49.553 --> 00:01:51.790
position yourself for your ideal customer.

00:01:51.814 --> 00:01:55.038
In order for this to be effective,
you must narrow your focus.

00:01:55.062 --> 00:01:57.540
Without focus, you try to be
everything for everyone,

00:01:57.564 --> 00:01:59.887
and you end up being nothing for nobody.

00:01:59.911 --> 00:02:03.322
Then, use the kind of language
that appeals to your target customer.

00:02:03.346 --> 00:02:07.386
Create the kind of marketing materials or
the kind of portfolio that attracts them.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.428
Then be in the real-life
and virtual places they are.

00:02:10.452 --> 00:02:12.413
For example, if you're a videographer

00:02:12.437 --> 00:02:14.876
and you want to work
with mission-driven companies

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.311
that bring clean water
to places where it's scarce,

00:02:17.335 --> 00:02:22.145
create a video trailer that shows exactly
how the power of film moves people to act.

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:27.093
Three: when it's time to talk money,
understand the real value that you create.

00:02:27.117 --> 00:02:30.934
You're not just being compensated
for the time that you work on a project.

00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:33.555
You're being compensated
for everything you've learned

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.564
and everything you've done over the years

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.802
that make you excellent at what you do.

00:02:37.826 --> 00:02:39.463
Ask yourself questions like:

00:02:39.487 --> 00:02:42.169
How does your service
impact a customer's bottom line?

00:02:42.193 --> 00:02:45.080
How do you create efficiencies
that generate cost savings?

00:02:45.104 --> 00:02:47.173
How much money can your customer make

00:02:47.197 --> 00:02:49.569
from a product that
you helped them create?

00:02:49.593 --> 00:02:53.347
For example, if you're a freelancer
that helps YouTube creators

00:02:53.371 --> 00:02:56.153
develop merch like T-shirts and dad hats,

00:02:56.177 --> 00:02:59.287
mention how much money
you've helped your clients generate.

00:02:59.311 --> 00:03:02.877
Or, if you've created a diversity
and inclusion training program

00:03:02.901 --> 00:03:04.325
for corporations,

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.162
talk about how much time and money
a company saves purchasing your product

00:03:08.186 --> 00:03:10.195
instead of developing their own.

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:15.075
Four: make sure your price includes
your taxes, your overhead and your profit.

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.020
When you're a freelancer,
you are your own business,

00:03:18.044 --> 00:03:20.020
so you're responsible for marketing,

00:03:20.044 --> 00:03:22.372
accounting, taxes, legal, insurance,

00:03:22.396 --> 00:03:24.614
overhead and profit.

00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:26.084
If you price too low,

00:03:26.108 --> 00:03:28.804
you've already negotiated
against yourself.

00:03:28.828 --> 00:03:31.860
And if a potential customer
balks at your pricing,

00:03:31.884 --> 00:03:33.410
don't apologize.

00:03:33.434 --> 00:03:35.300
Just say that you're running a business

00:03:35.324 --> 00:03:37.422
and you can't afford
to do the work for less.

00:03:37.446 --> 00:03:39.258
Instead of corrupting your creativity,

00:03:39.282 --> 00:03:42.775
focusing on making more money
could actually enhance it

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.727
by giving you the freedom of choice.

00:03:44.751 --> 00:03:48.944
Because when you earn enough
working with clients that value your work,

00:03:48.968 --> 00:03:52.186
you don't have to compromise
by working with clients who don't.
