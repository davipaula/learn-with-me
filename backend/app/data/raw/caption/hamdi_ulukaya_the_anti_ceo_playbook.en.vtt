00:00:14.183 --> 00:00:18.039
A cold January day of 2005,

00:00:18.063 --> 00:00:21.853
I took one of my most important
drives of my life.

00:00:23.117 --> 00:00:26.880
I was on this road in upstate New York,

00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:30.163
trying to find this old factory.

00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:34.941
The day before,
I received a flyer in the mail

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:38.325
that said, "Fully equipped
yogurt plant for sale."

00:00:39.315 --> 00:00:40.897
I threw it in the garbage can.

00:00:42.038 --> 00:00:45.925
And 20 minutes later,
I picked it up and called the number.

00:00:47.351 --> 00:00:49.094
The plant was 85 years old,

00:00:50.012 --> 00:00:51.193
and it was closing.

00:00:52.073 --> 00:00:53.635
So I decided to go see it.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.196
At this time,

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.687
I wasn't sure where this road
or my life was going.

00:01:02.307 --> 00:01:04.511
I owned a small cheese shop

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:05.854
but really hated business.

00:01:08.576 --> 00:01:12.778
But the hills and the roads
and the smells are all familiar.

00:01:14.425 --> 00:01:18.247
I grew up in Turkey,
in a similar environment,

00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:19.704
near the Kurdish mountains.

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.561
My family made cheese and yogurt;

00:01:22.585 --> 00:01:24.604
I grew up listening to shepherd's stories.

00:01:25.882 --> 00:01:27.720
We didn't have much,

00:01:27.744 --> 00:01:31.680
but we had the moon and the stars,
simple food, each other.

00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:35.101
Eventually, I came to America.

00:01:35.724 --> 00:01:37.844
I didn't even know New York had farms.

00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:41.874
I made it to upstate, and I never left.

00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:44.271
Now I'm lost.

00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:50.469
I passed the road sign
that said "Dead end."

00:01:51.506 --> 00:01:52.715
Then soon after,

00:01:53.308 --> 00:01:54.753
there it was:

00:01:54.777 --> 00:01:55.927
the factory.

00:01:58.642 --> 00:02:00.554
The smell hit me first.

00:02:01.118 --> 00:02:03.820
It was a like a milk container
left out in the sun.

00:02:05.228 --> 00:02:06.874
The walls were so thick,

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:11.077
paints were peeling,
there were cracks everywhere.

00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:16.680
The factory was so old,
the owners thought it was worthless.

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.271
I thought they left a zero off,

00:02:21.295 --> 00:02:23.229
I couldn't believe the price.

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.442
As I entered in,

00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:32.101
I stopped noticing things.

00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:34.258
All I could see were the people.

00:02:35.897 --> 00:02:37.571
There were 55 of them.

00:02:38.976 --> 00:02:40.126
Just quiet.

00:02:40.738 --> 00:02:44.659
Their only job was
to break the plant apart

00:02:44.683 --> 00:02:46.083
and close it forever.

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:49.855
I was met with a guy named Rich,

00:02:51.044 --> 00:02:52.221
the production manager.

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:55.847
He offered to take me around,
show me around.

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:57.506
He didn't say much,

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.005
but around every corner,
he would point out some stories.

00:03:02.268 --> 00:03:04.347
Rich worked there for 20 years.

00:03:04.371 --> 00:03:06.585
His father made yogurt before him,

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.264
and his grandfather
made cream cheese before that.

00:03:10.855 --> 00:03:14.808
You could tell that Rich felt guilty

00:03:15.792 --> 00:03:19.577
that this factory
was closing on his watch.

00:03:23.768 --> 00:03:26.522
What hit me the hardest at that time

00:03:27.442 --> 00:03:30.571
was that this wasn't just an old factory.

00:03:31.173 --> 00:03:32.773
This was a time machine.

00:03:33.836 --> 00:03:38.408
This is where people built lives,
they left for wars,

00:03:38.432 --> 00:03:41.260
they bragged about home runs
and report cards.

00:03:42.091 --> 00:03:43.691
But now, it was closing.

00:03:45.064 --> 00:03:48.653
And the company
wasn't just giving up on yogurt,

00:03:49.445 --> 00:03:51.112
it was giving up on them.

00:03:52.191 --> 00:03:53.861
As if they were not good enough.

00:03:56.567 --> 00:04:00.131
And I was shocked
how these people were behaving.

00:04:01.177 --> 00:04:03.844
There was no anger, there were no tears.

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:06.498
Just silence.

00:04:06.522 --> 00:04:09.455
With grace, they were
closing this factory.

00:04:13.212 --> 00:04:15.061
I was so angry

00:04:16.308 --> 00:04:18.355
that the CEO was far away,

00:04:20.522 --> 00:04:22.816
in a tower or somewhere,

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.045
looking at the spreadsheets

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:26.579
and closing the factory.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.528
Spreadsheets are lazy.

00:04:30.716 --> 00:04:34.517
They don't tell you about people,
they don't tell you about communities.

00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:36.152
But unfortunately,

00:04:36.176 --> 00:04:39.564
this is how too many
business decisions are made today.

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.726
I was never the same person
after what I saw.

00:04:48.318 --> 00:04:52.873
On my way back home,
I called Mario, my lawyer.

00:04:54.454 --> 00:04:57.906
I called Mario, I said,
"Mario, I want to buy this place."

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.939
Mario said,

00:05:00.963 --> 00:05:05.411
"Hamdi, one of the largest food companies
in the world is closing this place,

00:05:06.567 --> 00:05:08.987
and they're getting out
of the yogurt business.

00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:10.934
Who the hell are you to make it work?"

00:05:12.432 --> 00:05:13.689
I said, "You're right."

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:16.387
But the next day, I called him again,

00:05:16.411 --> 00:05:19.553
and I said, "Mario, really,
I really want to buy this place."

00:05:19.577 --> 00:05:21.276
He said, "Hamdi, you have no money.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.323
(Laughter)

00:05:22.347 --> 00:05:24.260
You haven't even paid me in six months."

00:05:24.284 --> 00:05:25.291
(Laughter)

00:05:25.315 --> 00:05:26.474
Which was true.

00:05:26.498 --> 00:05:27.648
(Laughter)

00:05:28.268 --> 00:05:30.334
But I got a loan, another loan.

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:35.115
By August 2005,
I had the keys for this factory.

00:05:36.093 --> 00:05:39.730
The first thing I did was to hire four
of the original 55 people.

00:05:40.215 --> 00:05:42.350
I had Maria, the office manager.

00:05:42.374 --> 00:05:45.016
I had Frank, the wastewater guy.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.117
I had Mike, the maintenance guy.

00:05:48.141 --> 00:05:51.152
And Rich, who showed me
the plant, the production guy.

00:05:51.855 --> 00:05:53.620
And we had our first board meeting.

00:05:55.173 --> 00:05:57.565
Mike says, "Hamdi, what
are we going to do now?"

00:05:58.133 --> 00:06:00.493
They look at me
as if I have the magic answer.

00:06:01.593 --> 00:06:02.793
So I said, "Mike,

00:06:03.974 --> 00:06:06.486
we're going to go to Ace Hardware store,

00:06:07.268 --> 00:06:08.950
and we're going to get some paints.

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:11.743
And we're going to paint
the walls outside."

00:06:13.217 --> 00:06:14.380
Mike wasn't impressed.

00:06:14.404 --> 00:06:15.569
He looked at me.

00:06:16.138 --> 00:06:18.709
He said, "Hamdi, that's fine,
weâ€™ll do that,

00:06:18.733 --> 00:06:20.755
but tell me you have
more ideas than that."

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:23.395
(Laughter)

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:24.569
I said, "I do.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.085
We'll paint the walls white."

00:06:27.109 --> 00:06:28.259
(Laughter)

00:06:28.657 --> 00:06:30.895
Honest to God,
that was the only idea I had.

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:32.553
(Laughter)

00:06:34.133 --> 00:06:36.825
But we painted those walls that summer.

00:06:39.318 --> 00:06:41.690
I sometimes wonder

00:06:41.714 --> 00:06:45.088
what they would have said
to me if I told them,

00:06:45.112 --> 00:06:47.312
"See these walls we're painting?

00:06:47.938 --> 00:06:49.692
In two years,

00:06:49.716 --> 00:06:51.465
we're going to launch a yogurt here

00:06:51.489 --> 00:06:54.358
that Americans have never seen
and never tasted before.

00:06:54.382 --> 00:06:56.533
It will be delicious, it will be natural.

00:06:56.557 --> 00:07:00.120
And we're going to call it 'Chobani' --
it means 'shepherd' in Turkish."

00:07:02.446 --> 00:07:03.596
And if I said,

00:07:04.446 --> 00:07:08.025
"We are going to hire
all of the 55 employees back,

00:07:08.049 --> 00:07:09.231
or most of them back.

00:07:09.255 --> 00:07:11.594
And then 100 more after,
and then 100 more after,

00:07:11.618 --> 00:07:13.221
and then 1,000 more after that."

00:07:13.245 --> 00:07:16.014
But if I told them,
"You see that town over there?

00:07:16.038 --> 00:07:19.657
Every person we hire,
10 more local jobs will be created.

00:07:19.681 --> 00:07:23.196
The town will come back to life,
the trucks will be all over the roads.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.752
And the first money we make,

00:07:24.776 --> 00:07:28.439
we're going to build one of the best
Little League baseball fields

00:07:28.463 --> 00:07:29.663
for our children.

00:07:30.323 --> 00:07:32.058
And five years after that,

00:07:32.082 --> 00:07:35.393
we're going to be the number one
Greek yogurt brand in the country."

00:07:36.096 --> 00:07:37.460
Would they have believed me?

00:07:38.556 --> 00:07:39.706
Of course not.

00:07:41.104 --> 00:07:43.109
But that's exactly what happened.

00:07:43.673 --> 00:07:49.623
(Applause)

00:07:50.085 --> 00:07:52.965
In painting those walls,

00:07:52.989 --> 00:07:54.455
we got to know each other.

00:07:55.442 --> 00:07:56.880
We believed in each other.

00:07:57.633 --> 00:07:59.393
And we figured it out together.

00:08:03.353 --> 00:08:07.886
Five years, me and all my colleagues,
we never left the factory.

00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:12.752
We worked day and night,
through the holidays,

00:08:12.776 --> 00:08:14.188
to fix that plant.

00:08:15.601 --> 00:08:18.401
The best part of Chobani for me is this:

00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:22.506
the same exact people
who were given up on

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.857
were the ones who built it back
100 times better than before.

00:08:28.389 --> 00:08:31.826
And they all have a financial stake
in the company today.

00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:37.793
(Applause)

00:08:38.491 --> 00:08:40.889
And all this time, I kept wondering --

00:08:40.913 --> 00:08:44.150
you see, I'm not a businessman,
I don't come from that tradition --

00:08:44.174 --> 00:08:47.754
I just kept wondering:
What is this all about?

00:08:49.287 --> 00:08:52.198
Corporate America says it's about profits.

00:08:52.222 --> 00:08:54.580
Mainstream business says it's about money.

00:08:54.604 --> 00:08:57.490
The CEO playbook says
it's about shareholders.

00:08:57.514 --> 00:09:02.236
And so much is sacrificed for it --
it's factories, communities, jobs.

00:09:03.093 --> 00:09:04.680
But not by CEOs.

00:09:05.956 --> 00:09:08.358
CEOs have their employees suffer for them.

00:09:09.011 --> 00:09:12.552
But yet, the CEOs's pay
goes up and up and up.

00:09:12.979 --> 00:09:15.473
And so many people are left behind.

00:09:17.227 --> 00:09:19.178
I'm here to tell you:

00:09:19.202 --> 00:09:20.364
no more.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.552
It's not right, it's never been right.

00:09:24.648 --> 00:09:26.771
It's time to admit

00:09:26.795 --> 00:09:31.021
that the playbook that guided businesses
and CEOs for the last 40 years

00:09:31.045 --> 00:09:32.195
is broken.

00:09:32.625 --> 00:09:37.003
(Applause)

00:09:37.027 --> 00:09:39.963
It tells you everything about business

00:09:39.987 --> 00:09:43.104
except how to be a noble leader.

00:09:44.757 --> 00:09:46.991
We need a new playbook.

00:09:47.015 --> 00:09:49.597
We need a new playbook
that sees people again.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:54.669
That sees above and beyond profits.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:00.579
In the movies, they have a name
for people who take a different path

00:10:00.603 --> 00:10:02.603
to do things right.

00:10:02.627 --> 00:10:04.445
They call them "antiheroes."

00:10:04.966 --> 00:10:07.776
I think we need the same idea in business.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.379
We need anti-CEOs,
and we need an anti-CEO playbook.

00:10:11.403 --> 00:10:15.229
So let me tell you about
what this anti-CEO playbook is all about.

00:10:16.712 --> 00:10:19.402
An anti-CEO playbook is about gratitude.

00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:22.493
Today's business book says:

00:10:22.517 --> 00:10:26.143
business exists to maximize profit
for the shareholders.

00:10:27.929 --> 00:10:30.708
I think that's the dumbest idea
I've ever heard in my life.

00:10:30.732 --> 00:10:31.737
(Laughter)

00:10:31.761 --> 00:10:36.228
In reality, business should take care
of their employees first.

00:10:36.752 --> 00:10:41.947
(Applause)

00:10:41.971 --> 00:10:43.232
You know, a few years ago,

00:10:43.256 --> 00:10:47.598
when we announced that we are giving
shares to all our 2,000 employees,

00:10:47.622 --> 00:10:52.206
some people said it's PR,
some said it's a gift.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.830
I said, it's not a gift.

00:10:55.341 --> 00:10:57.872
I watched it, I've been part of it.

00:10:57.896 --> 00:11:00.623
They earned it with their talent
and with their hard work,

00:11:00.637 --> 00:11:02.219
and I don't see any other way.

00:11:03.315 --> 00:11:05.307
The new way of business --

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.782
it's your employees
you take care of first.

00:11:08.692 --> 00:11:09.993
Not the profits.

00:11:12.144 --> 00:11:15.916
The new anti-CEO playbook
is about community.

00:11:17.359 --> 00:11:20.285
Today, the businesses that have it all

00:11:20.309 --> 00:11:24.596
ask communities, "What kind of tax breaks
and incentives can you give me?"

00:11:26.132 --> 00:11:30.625
The reality is, businesses should go
to the struggling communities

00:11:30.649 --> 00:11:32.815
and ask, "How can I help you?"

00:11:34.176 --> 00:11:37.938
(Applause)

00:11:37.962 --> 00:11:40.961
When we wanted to build
our second yogurt plant,

00:11:40.985 --> 00:11:43.319
Idaho was on nobody's radar screen.

00:11:43.784 --> 00:11:47.566
It was too rural, too far away,
didn't have much incentives.

00:11:47.974 --> 00:11:49.124
So I went there.

00:11:50.014 --> 00:11:53.439
I met with the local people,
I met with the farmers.

00:11:53.463 --> 00:11:55.724
We shook hands, we broke bread.

00:11:55.748 --> 00:11:58.448
I said, "I want to build it right here."

00:11:58.472 --> 00:12:00.513
I don't need to see financial studies.

00:12:01.732 --> 00:12:03.061
And the result --

00:12:05.236 --> 00:12:07.180
its community is thriving.

00:12:07.204 --> 00:12:09.260
There's new schools that open every year.

00:12:10.101 --> 00:12:12.910
New food companies
are coming up every year.

00:12:14.053 --> 00:12:15.204
And they told me,

00:12:15.228 --> 00:12:17.680
"You're not going to find
any trained workers here."

00:12:17.704 --> 00:12:19.617
I said, "It's OK, we'll teach them."

00:12:19.641 --> 00:12:22.014
We partnered with
the local community college,

00:12:22.919 --> 00:12:24.713
and while we were building the plant,

00:12:24.737 --> 00:12:28.347
we trained hundreds of hundreds of people
for advanced manufacturing.

00:12:28.371 --> 00:12:32.857
And today, our factory is one
of the largest yogurt plants in the world.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:36.452
(Applause)

00:12:36.476 --> 00:12:38.171
The new way of business --

00:12:39.148 --> 00:12:40.491
communities.

00:12:40.515 --> 00:12:43.283
Go search for communities
that you can be part of.

00:12:43.307 --> 00:12:44.704
Ask for permission.

00:12:45.338 --> 00:12:49.799
And be with them, open the walls
and succeed together.

00:12:52.985 --> 00:12:56.326
The anti-CEO playbook
is about responsibility.

00:12:57.033 --> 00:13:00.628
Today's playbook says, the businesses
should stay out of politics.

00:13:00.652 --> 00:13:01.898
The reality is

00:13:01.922 --> 00:13:05.083
businesses, as citizens, must take a side.

00:13:06.728 --> 00:13:10.877
When we were growing in New York
and looking for more people to hire,

00:13:10.901 --> 00:13:15.893
I remembered that in Utica, an hour away,

00:13:15.917 --> 00:13:19.686
there were refugees
from Southeast Asia and Africa,

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:21.752
who were looking for a place to work.

00:13:23.518 --> 00:13:25.590
"They don't speak English,"
someone told me.

00:13:25.614 --> 00:13:28.284
I said, "I don't really, either.
Let's get translators."

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:30.819
(Laughter)

00:13:31.327 --> 00:13:32.990
"They don't have transportation."

00:13:33.014 --> 00:13:35.616
I said, "Let's get buses,
it's not a rocket science."

00:13:36.506 --> 00:13:37.656
Today,

00:13:39.339 --> 00:13:42.196
in one of America's rural areas,

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.535
30 percent of the Chobani workforce
are immigrants and refugees.

00:13:45.559 --> 00:13:51.319
(Applause) (Cheers)

00:13:51.343 --> 00:13:53.076
And it changed us for better.

00:13:55.188 --> 00:13:57.164
The new way of business --

00:13:57.188 --> 00:14:01.522
it's business, not government,
in the best position to make a change

00:14:01.546 --> 00:14:02.712
in today's world:

00:14:02.736 --> 00:14:05.990
in gun violence, in climate change,

00:14:06.014 --> 00:14:09.717
in income inequality,
in refugees, in race.

00:14:09.741 --> 00:14:11.902
It's business that must take a side.

00:14:12.653 --> 00:14:16.590
(Applause)

00:14:16.614 --> 00:14:22.101
And lastly, an anti-CEO playbook
is about accountability.

00:14:23.546 --> 00:14:27.490
Today's playbook says, the CEO reports
to the corporate boards.

00:14:28.181 --> 00:14:31.683
In my opinion, CEO reports to consumer.

00:14:32.401 --> 00:14:34.180
In the first few years of Chobani,

00:14:34.204 --> 00:14:37.684
the 1-800 number on the cup
was my personal number.

00:14:38.052 --> 00:14:39.076
(Laughter)

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.625
When somebody called and wrote,
I responded personally.

00:14:42.649 --> 00:14:45.849
Sometimes I made changes
based on what I heard,

00:14:47.427 --> 00:14:49.815
because consumer is in power.

00:14:50.795 --> 00:14:53.328
That's the reason the business exists.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:15:00.667
It's you -- every single one of you
is in power to make changes today.

00:15:01.165 --> 00:15:03.323
If you don't like the brand
and the companies,

00:15:03.347 --> 00:15:05.307
what they are doing with their business,

00:15:05.331 --> 00:15:07.283
you can throw them into the garbage can.

00:15:07.307 --> 00:15:09.561
And if you see the ones
that are doing it right,

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:10.908
you can reward them.

00:15:12.083 --> 00:15:15.610
In the end, this is all
in our responsibility.

00:15:15.956 --> 00:15:17.265
The new way of business --

00:15:17.289 --> 00:15:20.376
it's the consumer we report to,
not to the corporate boards.

00:15:21.019 --> 00:15:22.298
You see,

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.329
if you are right with your people,

00:15:27.276 --> 00:15:29.959
if you are right with your community,

00:15:29.983 --> 00:15:32.610
if you are right with your product,

00:15:32.634 --> 00:15:34.943
you will be more profitable,

00:15:34.967 --> 00:15:36.999
you will be more innovative,

00:15:37.023 --> 00:15:39.531
you will have more passionate
people working for you

00:15:39.555 --> 00:15:41.537
and a community that supports you.

00:15:41.561 --> 00:15:44.643
And that's what the anti-CEO
playbook is all about.

00:15:47.355 --> 00:15:51.299
The treasure that I found
in that factory --

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.528
dignity of work,

00:15:57.552 --> 00:15:59.452
strength of character,

00:15:59.476 --> 00:16:00.782
human spirit --

00:16:01.212 --> 00:16:04.095
is what we need to unleash
all across the world.

00:16:07.088 --> 00:16:08.573
Brothers and sisters,

00:16:09.874 --> 00:16:14.779
there are people and places
all around the world

00:16:16.232 --> 00:16:18.042
left out and left behind.

00:16:19.193 --> 00:16:21.725
But their spirit is still strong.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.420
They just want another chance,

00:16:26.444 --> 00:16:29.871
they want someone
to give them a chance again,

00:16:29.895 --> 00:16:33.652
not to just build it back,
but build it better than before.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:39.338
And this is the difference
between return on investment

00:16:39.362 --> 00:16:40.901
and return on kindness.

00:16:42.717 --> 00:16:46.765
This is the difference between profit

00:16:46.789 --> 00:16:48.045
and true wealth.

00:16:50.701 --> 00:16:52.137
And if it can happen

00:16:53.034 --> 00:16:56.522
in a small town
in upstate New York and Idaho,

00:16:56.546 --> 00:17:00.839
it can happen in every city and town
and village across the world.

00:17:02.395 --> 00:17:04.823
This is not the time to build walls,

00:17:04.847 --> 00:17:07.752
this is a time to start
painting the walls.

00:17:07.776 --> 00:17:09.601
I leave the colors all up to you.

00:17:09.625 --> 00:17:10.825
Thank you so much.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:15.984
(Applause)
