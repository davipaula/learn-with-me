00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.136
Cyndi Stivers: So, future of storytelling.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.976
Before we do the future,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.896
let's talk about what is never
going to change about storytelling.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.016
Shonda Rhimes:
What's never going to change.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.776
Obviously, I think good stories
are never going to change,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.576
the need for people to gather together
and exchange their stories

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.816
and to talk about the things
that feel universal,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.776
the idea that we all feel
a compelling need to watch stories,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.760
to tell stories, to share stories --

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.976
sort of the gathering around the campfire

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.296
to discuss the things
that tell each one of us

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.000
that we are not alone in the world.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.016
Those things to me
are never going to change.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.200
That essence of storytelling
is never going to change.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.736
CS: OK. In preparation
for this conversation,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.656
I checked in with Susan Lyne,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.776
who was running ABC Entertainment

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.576
when you were working
on "Grey's Anatomy" --

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.816
SR: Yes.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.736
CS: And she said that there was
this indelible memory she had

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.736
of your casting process,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.416
where without discussing it
with any of the executives,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.816
you got people coming in
to read for your scripts,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.936
and every one of them
was the full range of humanity,

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.216
you did not type anyone in any way,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.056
and that it was completely surprising.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.736
So she said, in addition
to retraining the studio executives,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.856
you also, she feels,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.416
and I think this is -- I agree,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.840
retrained the expectations
of the American TV audience.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.520
So what else does the audience
not yet realize that it needs?

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.336
SR: What else does it not yet realize?

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.496
Well, I mean, I don't think
we're anywhere near there yet.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.256
I mean, we're still in a place

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.216
in which we're far, far behind what looks
like the real world in actuality.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.936
I wasn't bringing in
a bunch of actors

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.576
who looked very different from one another

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.696
simply because I was
trying to make a point,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.056
and I wasn't trying
to do anything special.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.056
It never occurred to me
that that was new, different or weird.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.136
I just brought in actors
because I thought they were interesting

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.976
and to me, the idea that it
was completely surprising to everybody --

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.175
I didn't know that for a while.

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.416
I just thought: these are the actors
I want to see play these parts.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.656
I want to see what
they look like if they read.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.936
We'll see what happens.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.336
So I think the interesting thing
that happens is

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.896
that when you look at the world
through another lens,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.176
when you're not the person
normally in charge of things,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.840
it just comes out a different way.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.816
CS: So you now have
this big machine that you run,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.856
as a titan -- as you know,
last year when she gave her talk --

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.816
she's a titan.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.216
So what do you think
is going to happen as we go on?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.136
There's a huge amount of money
involved in producing these shows.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.376
While the tools of making stories
have gone and gotten greatly democratized,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.936
there's still this large distribution:

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.056
people who rent networks,
who rent the audience to advertisers

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.776
and make it all pay.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.016
How do you see the business model changing
now that anyone can be a storyteller?

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.776
SR: I think it's changing every day.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.736
I mean, the rapid, rapid change
that's happening is amazing.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.096
And I feel -- the panic is palpable,

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.936
and I don't mean that in a bad way.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.616
I think it's kind of exciting.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.296
The idea that there's
sort of an equalizer happening,

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.096
that sort of means that anybody
can make something, is wonderful.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.856
I think there's some scary in the idea
that you can't find the good work now.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.376
There's so much work out there.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.496
I think there's something like
417 dramas on television right now

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.056
at any given time in any given place,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.336
but you can't find them.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.776
You can't find the good ones.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.456
So there's a lot of bad stuff out there
because everybody can make something.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.496
It's like if everybody painted a painting.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.016
You know, there's not
that many good painters.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.056
But finding the good stories,
the good shows,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.656
is harder and harder and harder.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.296
Because if you have
one tiny show over here on AMC

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.216
and one tiny show over here over there,

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.576
finding where they are
becomes much harder.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.456
So I think that ferreting out the gems

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.576
and finding out who made
the great webisode and who made this,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.696
it's -- I mean, think
about the poor critics

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.416
who now are spending 24 hours a day

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.496
trapped in their homes
watching everything.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.616
It's not an easy job right now.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.216
So the distribution engines
are getting more and more vast,

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.176
but finding the good programming
for everybody in the audience

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.416
is getting harder.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.216
And unlike the news,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.776
where everything's getting
winnowed down to just who you are,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.416
television seems to be getting --

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.376
and by television I mean anything
you can watch, television shows on --

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.616
seems to be getting
wider and wider and wider.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.296
And so anybody's making stories,

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.616
and the geniuses are sometimes hidden.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.416
But it's going to be harder to find,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.456
and at some point that will collapse.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.216
People keep talking about peak TV.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.216
I don't know when that's going to happen.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.696
I think at some point
it'll collapse a little bit

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.616
and we'll, sort of, come back together.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.816
I don't know if it
will be network television.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.880
I don't know if that model is sustainable.

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.976
CS: What about the model

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.440
that Amazon and Netflix are throwing
a lot of money around right now.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.816
SR: That is true.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.496
I think it's an interesting model.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.616
I think there's
something exciting about it.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.776
For content creators, I think
there's something exciting about it.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.536
For the world, I think
there's something exciting about it.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.296
The idea that there are programs now

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.776
that can be in multiple languages
with characters from all over the world

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.776
that are appealing and come out
for everybody at the same time

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.216
is exciting.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.736
I mean, I think the international sense
that television can now take on

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.976
makes sense to me,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.616
that programming can now take on.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.896
Television so much is made for, like --
here's our American audience.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.176
We make these shows,

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.216
and then they shove them
out into the world

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.536
and hope for the best,

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.496
as opposed to really thinking
about the fact that America is not it.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.256
I mean, we love ourselves
and everything, but it's not i.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.456
And we should be
taking into account the fact

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.976
that there are all
of these other places in the world

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.016
that we should be interested in
while we're telling stories.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.120
It makes the world smaller.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.736
I don't know.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.736
I think it pushes forward the idea
that the world is a universal place,

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.696
and our stories become universal things.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.960
We stop being other.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.456
CS: You've pioneered, as far as I can see,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.096
interesting ways to launch new shows, too.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.136
I mean, when you
launched "Scandal" in 2012,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.616
there was this amazing groundswell
of support on Twitter

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.776
the likes of which nobody had seen before.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.216
Do you have any other
tricks up your sleeve

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.376
when you launch your next one?

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.536
What do you think
will happen in that regard?

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.016
SR: We do have some interesting ideas.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.176
We have a show called "Still Star-Crossed"
coming out this summer.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.136
We have some interesting ideas for that.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.896
I'm not sure if we're going
to be able to do them in time.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.136
I thought they were fun.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.336
But the idea
that we would live-tweet our show

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.536
was really just us thinking
that would be fun.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.096
We didn't realize that the critics
would start to live-tweet along with us.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.496
But the fans -- getting people
to be a part of it,

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.056
making it more of a campfire --

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.216
you know, when you're all
on Twitter together

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.816
and you're all talking together,

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.496
it is more of a shared experience,

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.656
and finding other ways
to make that possible

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.016
and finding other ways
to make people feel engaged

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.240
is important.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.960
CS: So when you have
all those different people making stories

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.256
and only some of them
are going to break through

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.056
and get that audience somehow,

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.056
how do you think
storytellers will get paid?

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.016
SR: I actually have been struggling
with this concept as well.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.136
Is it going to be a subscriber model?

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.816
Are people going to say, like, I'm going
to watch this particular person's shows,

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.576
and that's how we're going to do it?

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.336
CS: I think we should buy
a passport to Shondaland. Right?

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.616
SR: I don't know about that, but yeah.
That's a lot more work for me.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.456
I do think that there are
going to be different ways,

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.976
but I don't know necessarily.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.656
I mean, I'll be honest and say
a lot of content creators

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.096
are not necessarily interested
in being distributors,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.336
mainly because what I dream of doing

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.776
is creating content.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.656
I really love to create content.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.896
I want to get paid for it

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.096
and I want to get paid the money
that I deserve to get paid for it,

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.056
and there's a hard part in finding that.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.616
But I also want it to be made possible

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.616
for, you know,
the people who work with me,

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.976
the people who work for me,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.376
everybody to sort of get paid in a way,
and they're all making a living.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.600
How it gets distributed
is getting harder and harder.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.616
CS: How about the many new tools,

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.856
you know, VR, AR ...

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.896
I find it fascinating
that you can't really binge-watch,

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.176
you can't fast-forward in those things.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.336
What do you see as the future
of those for storytelling?

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.096
SR: I spent a lot of time in the past year

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.696
just exploring those,

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.376
getting lots of demonstrations
and paying attention.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.216
I find them fascinating,

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.216
mainly because I think that --

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.536
I think most people
think of them for gaming,

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.256
I think most people think of them
for things like action,

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.936
and I think that there is
a sense of intimacy

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.856
that is very present in those things,

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.376
the idea that -- picture this,

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.896
you can sit there
and have a conversation with Fitz,

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.096
or at least sit there
while Fitz talks to you,

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.016
President Fitzgerald Grant III,

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.336
while he talks to you

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.496
about why he's making
a choice that he makes,

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.136
and it's a very heartfelt moment.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.736
And instead of you watching
a television screen,

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.976
you're sitting there next to him,
and he's having this conversation.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.656
Now, you fall in love with the man

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.816
while he's doing it
from a television screen.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.216
Imagine sitting next to him,

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.296
or being with a character like Huck
who's about to execute somebody.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.816
And instead of having a scene

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.656
where, you know, he's talking
to another character very rapidly,

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.056
he goes into a closet and turns to you
and tells you, you know,

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.696
what's going to happen
and why he's afraid and nervous.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.736
It's a little more like theater,
and I'm not sure it would work,

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.456
but I'm fascinating by the concept
of something like that

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.456
and what that would mean for an audience.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.176
And to get to play with those ideas
would be interesting,

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.616
and I think, you know, for my audience,
the people who watch my shows,

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.936
which is, you know, women 12 to 75,

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.640
there's something interesting
in there for them.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.496
CS: And how about
the input of the audience?

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.336
How interested are you in the things

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.496
where the audience
can actually go up to a certain point

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.176
and then decide, oh wait,
I'm going to choose my own adventure.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.136
I'm going to run off with Fitz
or I'm going to run off with --

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.376
SR: Oh, the choose-
your-own-adventure stories.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.856
I have a hard time with those,

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.016
and not necessarily because
I want to be in control of everything,

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.416
but because when I'm watching television
or I'm watching a movie,

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:44.256
I know for a fact
that a story is not as good

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.056
when I have control
over exactly what's going to happen

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.816
to somebody else's character.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.616
You know, if I could tell you exactly
what I wanted to happen to Walter White,

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.216
that's great, but the story
is not the same, and it's not as powerful.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.816
You know, if I'm in charge
of how "The Sopranos" ends,

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.016
then that's lovely and I have an ending
that's nice and satisfying,

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.216
but it's not the same story
and it's not the same emotional impact.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.616
CS: I can't stop imagining
what that might be.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.456
Sorry, you're losing me for a minute.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.056
SR: But what's wonderful is
I don't get to imagine it,

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.216
because Vince has his own ending,

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:18.776
and it makes it really powerful
to know that somebody else has told.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.056
You know, if you could
decide that, you know,

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.296
in "Jaws," the shark wins or something,

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.416
it doesn't do what it needs to do for you.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.155
The story is the story that is told,

00:11:28.179 --> 00:11:30.896
and you can walk away angry
and you can walk away debating

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.376
and you can walk away arguing,

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.640
but that's why it works.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.536
That is why it's art.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.376
Otherwise, it's just a game,

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.416
and games can be art,
but in a very different way.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.016
CS: Gamers who actually
sell the right to sit there

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.176
and comment on what's happening,

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.176
to me that's more community
than storytelling.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.176
SR: And that is its own form of campfire.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.336
I don't discount that
as a form of storytelling,

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.760
but it is a group form, I suppose.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.656
CS: All right,
what about the super-super --

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.896
the fact that everything's
getting shorter, shorter, shorter.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.176
And, you know, Snapchat
now has something it calls shows

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.800
that are one minute long.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.320
SR: It's interesting.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.480
Part of me thinks
it sounds like commercials.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.096
I mean, it does -- like, sponsored by.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.736
But part of me also gets it completely.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.856
There's something
really wonderful about it.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.176
If you think about a world

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.096
in which most people
are watching television on their phones,

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.976
if you think about a place like India,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.736
where most of the input is coming in

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.136
and that's where
most of the product is coming in,

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.416
shorter makes sense.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.976
If you can charge people more
for shorter periods of content,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.256
some distributor has figured out
a way to make a lot more money.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.296
If you're making content,

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.216
it costs less money
to make it and put it out there.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.456
And, by the way,

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:54.976
if you're 14 and have
a short attention span, like my daughter,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.736
that's what you want to see,
that's what you want to make,

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.976
that's how it works.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.216
And if you do it right
and it actually feels like narrative,

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.560
people will hang on for it
no matter what you do.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.456
CS: I'm glad you raised your daughters,

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.296
because I am wondering how are they
going to consume entertainment,

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.576
and also not just entertainment,

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.800
but news, too.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.936
When they're not -- I mean,
the algorithmic robot overlords

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.056
are going to feed them
what they've already done.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.680
How do you think we will correct for that
and make people well-rounded citizens?

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.936
SR: Well, me and how I correct for it

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.736
is completely different
than how somebody else might do it.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.856
CS: Feel free to speculate.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.856
SR: I really don't know
how we're going to do it in the future.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.296
I mean, my poor children have been
the subject of all of my experiments.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.696
We're still doing
what I call "Amish summers"

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.456
where I turn off all electronics

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.536
and pack away
all their computers and stuff

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.536
and watch them scream for a while
until they settle down

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.320
into, like, an electronic-free summer.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.976
But honestly, it's a very hard world

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.016
in which now, as grown-ups,

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.176
we're so interested
in watching our own thing,

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.376
and we don't even know
that we're being fed, sometimes,

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.136
just our own opinions.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.856
You know, the way it's working now,

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.136
you're watching a feed,

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.776
and the feeds are being corrected

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.936
so that you're only getting
your own opinions

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.496
and you're feeling
more and more right about yourself.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.376
So how do you really start to discern?

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.216
It's getting a little bit disturbing.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.056
So maybe it'll overcorrect,
maybe it'll all explode,

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.720
or maybe we'll all just become --

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.616
I hate to be negative about it,

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:33.576
but maybe we'll all
just become more idiotic.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.336
(Cyndi laughs)

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.776
CS: Yeah, can you picture
any corrective that you could do

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.696
with scripted, fictional work?

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.376
SR: I think a lot about the fact
that television has the power

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.136
to educate people in a powerful way,

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.016
and when you're watching television --

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.296
for instance, they do studies
about medical shows.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.456
I think it's 87 percent,
87 percent of people

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.856
get most of their knowledge
about medicine and medical facts

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.336
from medical shows,

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.496
much more so than
they do from their doctors,

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.896
than from articles.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.336
So we work really hard to be accurate,
and every time we make a mistake,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.176
I feel really guilty,
like we're going to do something bad,

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.856
but we also give a lot
of good medical information.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.936
There are so many other ways
to give information on those shows.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.336
People are being entertained

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.416
and maybe they don't want
to read the news,

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.856
but there are a lot of ways to give
fair information out on those shows,

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.496
not in some creepy, like,
we're going to control people's minds way,

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.376
but in a way that's sort of
very interesting and intelligent

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.856
and not about pushing
one side's version or the other,

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.216
like, giving out the truth.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.176
It would be strange, though,

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.936
if television drama
was how we were giving the news.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.216
CS: It would be strange,

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.456
but I gather a lot of what
you've written as fiction

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.880
has become prediction this season?

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.816
SR: You know, "Scandal" has been
very disturbing for that reason.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.816
We have this show
that's about politics gone mad,

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.776
and basically the way
we've always told the show --

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.176
you know, everybody
pays attention to the papers.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.336
We read everything.
We talk about everything.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.296
We have lots of friends in Washington.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.176
And we'd always sort of
done our show as a speculation.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.696
We'd sit in the room and think,

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.976
what would happen
if the wheels came off the bus

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.296
and everything went crazy?

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.856
And that was always great,

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.816
except now it felt like
the wheels were coming off the bus

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.656
and things were actually going crazy,

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.656
so the things that we were speculating
were really coming true.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.056
I mean, our season this year

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.856
was going to end with the Russians
controlling the American election,

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.536
and we'd written it, we'd planned for it,

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.776
it was all there,

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.616
and then the Russians were suspected
of being involved in the American election

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.976
and we suddenly had to change
what we were going to do for our season.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.336
I walked in and I was like,

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.216
"That scene where our mystery woman
starts speaking Russian?

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.096
We have to fix that
and figure out what we're going to do."

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.776
That just comes from extrapolating

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.016
out from what we thought
was going to happen,

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.520
or what we thought was crazy.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.816
CS: That's great.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:56.736
So where else in US or elsewhere
in the world do you look?

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.216
Who is doing interesting
storytelling right now?

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.256
SR: I don't know, there's a lot
of interesting stuff out there.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.216
Obviously British television
is always amazing

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:07.856
and always does interesting things.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.176
I don't get to watch a lot of TV,

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.616
mainly because I'm busy working.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:16.256
And I pretty much try not to watch
very much television at all,

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.175
even American television,
until I'm done with a season,

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.695
because things start
to creep into my head otherwise.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.656
I start to wonder, like,

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.096
why can't our characters wear crowns
and talk about being on a throne?

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:28.776
It gets crazy.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.536
So I try not to watch much
until the seasons are over.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.296
But I do think that there's a lot of
interesting European television out there.

00:17:36.319 --> 00:17:38.215
I was at the International Emmys

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.216
and looking around and seeing
the stuff that they were showing,

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.656
and I was kind of fascinated.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.416
There's some stuff
I want to watch and check out.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.696
CS: Can you imagine --

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.256
I know that you don't spend a lot of time
thinking about tech stuff,

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.296
but you know how a few years ago
we had someone here at TED

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.576
talking about seeing,

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:01.736
wearing Google Glass and seeing
your TV shows essentially in your eye?

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.056
Do you ever fantasize when, you know --

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.536
the little girl
who sat on the pantry floor

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.296
in your parents' house,

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.920
did you ever imagine any other medium?

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.656
Or would you now?

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.016
SR: Any other medium.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.736
For storytelling, other than books?

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.576
I mean, I grew up wanting
to be Toni Morrison, so no.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.576
I mean, I didn't even imagine television.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.456
So the idea that there could be
some bigger world,

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.656
some more magical way of making things ---

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.936
I'm always excited
when new technology comes out

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.976
and I'm always the first one
to want to try it.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.176
The possibilities feel endless
and exciting right now,

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.640
which is what excites me.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.096
We're in this sort of Wild West period,
to me, it feels like,

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.536
because nobody knows
what we're going to settle on.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.776
You can put stories anywhere right now

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:48.256
and that's cool to me,

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:52.416
and it feels like once we figure out
how to get the technology

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.896
and the creativity
of storytelling to meet,

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.349
the possibilities are endless.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:03.016
CS: And also the technology has enabled
the thing I briefly flew by earlier,

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.016
binge-viewing,
which is a recent phenomenon,

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.216
since you've been doing shows, right?

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.936
And how do you think does that change
the storytelling process at all?

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.776
You always had a bible
for the whole season beforehand, right?

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.136
SR: No, I just always knew
where we were going to end.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.496
So for me,

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.496
the only way I can really comment on that

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:29.216
is that I have a show
that's been going on for 14 seasons

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.536
and so there are the people
who have been watching it for 14 seasons,

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.096
and then there are the 12-year-old girls
I'd encounter in the grocery store

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.096
who had watched
297 episodes in three weeks.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.936
Seriously, and that's a very different
experience for them,

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.896
because they've been inside of something

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.336
really intensely for
a very short period of time

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.856
in a very intense way,

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.816
and to them the story
has a completely different arc

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.496
and a completely different meaning

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.096
because it never had any breaks.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.456
CS: It's like visiting a country
and then leaving it. It's a strange --

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.536
SR: It's like reading an amazing novel
and then putting it down.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:05.616
I think that is the beauty
of the experience.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.576
You don't necessarily have to watch
something for 14 seasons.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.280
It's not necessarily
the way everything's supposed to be.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.920
CS: Is there any topic
that you don't think we should touch?

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.776
SR: I don't think
I think of story that way.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.976
I think of story in terms of character
and what characters would do

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.216
and what characters need to do
in order to make them move forward,

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.416
so I'm never really thinking of story
in terms of just plot,

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.376
and when writers come
into my writer's room and pitch me plot,

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.496
I say, "You're not speaking English."

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.936
Like, that's the thing I say.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.576
We're not speaking English.
I need to hear what's real.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.336
And so I don't think of it that way.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.696
I don't know if there's a way
to think there's something I wouldn't do

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.336
because that feels like I'm plucking
pieces of plot off a wall or something.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.496
CS: That's great. To what extent
do you think you will use --

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.456
You know, you recently went
on the board of Planned Parenthood

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.176
and got involved
in the Hillary Clinton campaign.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:58.816
To what extent do you think
you will use your storytelling

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.576
in the real world

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.040
to effect change?

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.960
SR: Well, you know, there's --

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.896
That's an intense subject to me,

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.696
because I feel like the lack of narrative

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:17.696
that a lot of people have is difficult.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.896
You know, like,
there's a lot of organizations

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.936
that don't have a positive narrative
that they've created for themselves

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.280
that would help them.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.816
There's a lot of campaigns

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.456
that could be helped
with a better narrative.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.976
The Democrats could do a lot

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.096
with a very strong
narrative for themselves.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.536
There's a lot of different things
that could happen

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.376
in terms of using storytelling voice,

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.296
and I don't mean that in a fiction way,

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.456
I mean that in a same way
that any speechwriter would mean it.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.696
And I see that,

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.896
but I don't necessarily know
that that's, like, my job to do that.

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.136
CS: All right.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.776
Please help me thank Shonda.
SR: Thank you.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.280
(Applause)
