00:00:15.246 --> 00:00:18.347
Before we dive in, I want to ask
a couple of questions.

00:00:18.377 --> 00:00:21.840
First, how many of you
are vegetarian or vegan?

00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:25.972
Okay, a few - around maybe 5%.

00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:29.789
If we asked all US adults,
it would be around 5, maybe 10%.

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:32.860
Now, how many of you have seen
at least one of the following:

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.721
a video of animal cruelty
on factory farms,

00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:37.591
a documentary or news report

00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:40.630
on the environmental harms
of animal agriculture,

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.533
or a scientific article
on the public health issues

00:00:43.563 --> 00:00:46.354
such as the overuse
of antibiotics in animal feed?

00:00:46.384 --> 00:00:47.732
How many?

00:00:48.262 --> 00:00:50.028
Okay, almost everyone.

00:00:50.058 --> 00:00:52.170
Probably over 95%.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.798
Now, when I see that jump from 5%,
I worry that I've made a huge mistake.

00:00:57.818 --> 00:00:59.883
Full disclosure, I'm a vegan.

00:00:59.913 --> 00:01:01.502
(Laughter)

00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:02.835
I'm even a preachy vegan,

00:01:02.865 --> 00:01:05.948
who tells everyone I meet
about the problems of animal farming

00:01:05.968 --> 00:01:09.552
because I really do think it's one
of the most important issues of our time.

00:01:09.582 --> 00:01:12.533
But my mistake, and the mistake
of other food advocates,

00:01:12.563 --> 00:01:14.522
has been trying to fix these issues

00:01:14.542 --> 00:01:18.649
solely by telling you personally
to go vegan, vegetarian,

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:20.792
or to reduce your meat consumption.

00:01:21.322 --> 00:01:24.978
We need a bigger, better solution
for our broken food system.

00:01:25.748 --> 00:01:29.620
And you might wonder if our country
has at least switched from factory farming

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.422
to more humane practices.

00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:33.430
I grew up in rural Texas.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.461
I spent a lot of time
around farmed animals

00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:37.511
lounging on green pastures.

00:01:37.541 --> 00:01:41.091
Back then, I thought
all farmed animals lived that way.

00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:43.883
Unfortunately, according to USDA data,

00:01:43.913 --> 00:01:48.954
over 99% of farmed animals
live on factory farms.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.777
The situation is dire.

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:55.491
There are over 100 billion animals
in the global food system.

00:01:55.511 --> 00:02:00.171
Many of them are confined in tiny cages,
barely larger than their own bodies.

00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:04.166
Their beaks and tails
are cut off without anesthetic.

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:06.862
They suffer, day and night,
from infectious diseases

00:02:06.882 --> 00:02:08.616
and intense artificial selection

00:02:08.646 --> 00:02:13.210
that has them growing so much meat
that they collapse under their own weight.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.212
Animal farming pollutes
our land and water,

00:02:16.232 --> 00:02:19.924
endangering the health
and economies of rural Americans.

00:02:19.954 --> 00:02:22.615
It's responsible for more
greenhouse gas emissions

00:02:22.645 --> 00:02:27.351
than all planes, cars, trains
and other transportation combined.

00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:31.948
Eighty percent of all US antibiotics
are fed to farmed animals,

00:02:31.978 --> 00:02:35.333
leading to dangerous,
incurable human diseases.

00:02:35.943 --> 00:02:39.710
Finally, animal farming
is just incredibly expensive.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.339
It receives $38 billion in subsidies
every year from the US government,

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.399
and it sucks up massive amounts
of natural resources

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:50.192
that should be going
to help people in need.

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:52.315
I think we can all agree

00:02:52.335 --> 00:02:56.660
that this is an urgent social issue
that we desperately need to fix.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.279
And by "we," I don't
just mean vegetarians.

00:02:59.309 --> 00:03:02.249
I mean everyone who cares
about these problems.

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:05.421
Finding a solution
to this seemingly intractable issue

00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:08.121
is also a fascinating
intellectual problem,

00:03:08.151 --> 00:03:11.503
one we can tackle with the tools
of Effective Altruism ...

00:03:11.533 --> 00:03:15.020
their growing mindset in charity,
business and politics

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.900
of using evidence-based research

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.077
to find and implement the most effective
solutions to the world's biggest problems.

00:03:22.957 --> 00:03:26.022
The most powerful tool
we have is innovation.

00:03:26.412 --> 00:03:31.531
The amazing thing is that we don't have
to give up meat, dairy, or eggs

00:03:31.551 --> 00:03:33.301
to end animal farming.

00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:36.081
Think about it: what's meat?

00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:39.712
It's fat, protein, water
and trace minerals.

00:03:39.742 --> 00:03:42.791
All these ingredients are readily
available in the plant kingdom.

00:03:42.811 --> 00:03:46.300
They're just not assembled
in the architecture of meat.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.892
That's what a cow does.

00:03:47.922 --> 00:03:50.232
But a cow also does
a lot of stuff we don't need.

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:52.240
She grows hair, teeth, bones.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.401
She walks around;
she breathes, thinks, and feels.

00:03:55.431 --> 00:03:56.809
These extra processes mean

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.889
that for every 10 calories of plant-based
food we feed a farmed animal,

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.473
we get around 1 calorie of meat in return.

00:04:03.503 --> 00:04:07.083
Even with the nutrient animal products
are most known for, protein,

00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:12.061
for every 10 grams of plant-based,
we get, at most, 2 grams of animal-based.

00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:14.833
So what if we assembled
these ingredients ourselves

00:04:14.863 --> 00:04:17.221
with a more efficient, ethical process?

00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:21.219
That's the approach of companies
like Beyond Meat, Hungry Planet,

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.904
and Impossible Foods.

00:04:22.934 --> 00:04:26.091
They've already succeeded
in making a beef burger made from plants.

00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:28.451
Many consumers can't
even tell the difference.

00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:31.241
Today, they're just
perfecting that product

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:35.651
and scaling up the process
to lower costs and widen distribution.

00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:40.182
In fact, the Beyond Burger pictured here
is already available in Mississippi.

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.300
But let's be cautious.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.140
What if consumers are really picky?

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.365
What if they don't just want something
that tastes like animal meat,

00:04:48.395 --> 00:04:51.282
but something that is actually made
from animal cells?

00:04:51.302 --> 00:04:52.619
Well, there's good news.

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:55.810
Scientists and chefs have been working
on so-called clean meat,

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.634
real meat made without the food safety
and ethical cost of animal slaughter.

00:05:00.664 --> 00:05:04.341
To do this, they take a small sample
of cells from a living animal

00:05:04.361 --> 00:05:06.323
and place those cells in a cultivator,

00:05:06.353 --> 00:05:09.481
which looks like one
of the big tanks at a beer brewery.

00:05:09.501 --> 00:05:12.559
Inside, the cells mix
with the nutrients they need to grow

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:15.384
in the same process
that happens inside an animal's body,

00:05:15.404 --> 00:05:16.380
and voila!

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.859
You can have your cow and eat beef too.

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:19.985
(Laughter)

00:05:20.005 --> 00:05:21.641
But you might be thinking,

00:05:21.661 --> 00:05:24.830
"Not all beneficial technologies
are widely adopted, right?

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.591
So what if something goes wrong?

00:05:26.621 --> 00:05:28.952
What if the technology is fully developed,

00:05:28.982 --> 00:05:32.179
but perceived as just another
food for vegetarians?

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.654
Or what if an irresponsible company
lets their product get contaminated,

00:05:35.684 --> 00:05:39.421
leading to a cascade of negative press
that cripples the industry?"

00:05:39.441 --> 00:05:42.708
With conventional meat, we see
contamination scandals all the time,

00:05:42.738 --> 00:05:46.200
but for a young industry
like clean meat, it could be fatal.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.809
It's like self-driving cars,

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:50.979
where the industry needs to be
especially careful about collisions,

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:53.358
despite having an overall
better safety record.

00:05:53.838 --> 00:05:58.004
So what social change will we see
on our way to an animal-free food system?

00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:02.070
The biggest one is a shift
beyond the individual

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.373
and towards institutional change.

00:06:04.923 --> 00:06:06.068
Like I said earlier,

00:06:06.098 --> 00:06:10.801
advocates have thus far focused heavily
on one-by-one diet change,

00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:13.021
but I believe we'll see
the biggest changes

00:06:13.021 --> 00:06:15.411
happen with changes to institutions

00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:20.129
like businesses, government,
nonprofits and society as a whole.

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:23.780
There's a lot of evidence
that this strategy is more effective.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.511
Last year, I was at a protest,

00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:30.482
calling for a restaurant chain to reform
its animal-welfare policies,

00:06:30.512 --> 00:06:33.578
just basic stuff, like choosing
healthier breeds of chickens,

00:06:33.598 --> 00:06:36.611
or having windows in the chicken sheds.

00:06:36.641 --> 00:06:40.702
A pedestrian walked up and thanked me
profusely for helping these poor animals.

00:06:40.732 --> 00:06:44.411
I told him he was welcome to join us,
as bystanders sometimes do,

00:06:44.431 --> 00:06:48.560
and he said, "Oh no, no, no.
I can't. I'm not a vegetarian."

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.569
I insisted that he was welcome
to join us without being vegetarian.

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:55.441
We were just calling
for better treatment for these animals.

00:06:55.471 --> 00:06:57.071
But he was unconvinced.

00:06:57.101 --> 00:07:01.229
He saw vegetarianism as a prerequisite
to helping farmed animals

00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:04.250
because advocates have conflated
the two for so long.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.728
If we had, instead,
used an institutional framing,

00:07:06.748 --> 00:07:11.258
that bystander might have joined us
and maybe become vegetarian along the way.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:14.051
This strategy also helps people avoid

00:07:14.081 --> 00:07:17.329
what psychologists call
"the collapse of compassion,"

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:20.999
the feeling of apathy that comes
when we encounter a big problem

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:23.325
without clearly seeing the big solution.

00:07:23.345 --> 00:07:25.998
The institutional framing
puts that solution,

00:07:26.028 --> 00:07:28.001
changing society as a whole,

00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:30.070
front and center in our messaging.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.160
This strategy is also well-evidenced
by historical social movements,

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.709
which is what I spend
most of my time researching.

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:38.150
Virtually no movements -

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.432
from environmentalism, children's rights,

00:07:40.462 --> 00:07:43.030
antislavery, feminism
to antiwar movements -

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.731
have succeeded with the heavy,
individual focus

00:07:45.761 --> 00:07:48.072
that we see in the farmed-animal movement.

00:07:48.102 --> 00:07:49.940
Consumer advocacy like boycotts

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.233
have succeeded when used as tools
for institutional change,

00:07:53.263 --> 00:07:55.570
but failed when treated as an end goal.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.620
We need to learn from the past.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.260
The second big change is a shift
beyond opposition to factory farming alone

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.281
and towards opposition
to animal farming as whole.

00:08:06.311 --> 00:08:08.911
There's a lot of evidence
for this strategy too.

00:08:08.941 --> 00:08:11.220
First, numerous investigations have shown

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.250
that so-called humane farms
are rarely humane in practice.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.384
The most picturesque farm
I've ever been on

00:08:17.404 --> 00:08:20.134
was an award-winning California egg farm.

00:08:20.164 --> 00:08:23.355
But because of the farm's natural
and organic policies,

00:08:23.385 --> 00:08:26.088
they didn't vaccinate the birds
or give them antibiotics,

00:08:26.118 --> 00:08:27.838
like factory farms do.

00:08:27.868 --> 00:08:29.839
This led to atrocious health.

00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:31.776
I saw many cases of Marek's,

00:08:31.796 --> 00:08:36.350
a highly contagious disease that often
leads to blindness and missing eyes;

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.809
fluid belly, some birds
with over a pound of fluid buildup

00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:42.551
inside their less than five-pound bodies;

00:08:42.581 --> 00:08:45.799
fungal infections;
lice on almost all of them;

00:08:45.819 --> 00:08:48.172
and many birds crippled by eggs

00:08:48.202 --> 00:08:51.246
that had gotten stuck
inside them on the way out.

00:08:52.349 --> 00:08:53.525
I've been dismayed

00:08:53.555 --> 00:08:57.570
that the reality of these farms
is nearly as bad as factory farming.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.449
While reduction in suffering
is something we should applaud,

00:09:00.469 --> 00:09:02.355
and it can be a step towards abolition,

00:09:02.385 --> 00:09:05.844
the unmitigated suffering
is still a moral catastrophe.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.383
Second, simply the idea

00:09:08.413 --> 00:09:11.331
that there are humane ways
to raise and kill animals for food

00:09:11.351 --> 00:09:12.763
is a huge roadblock,

00:09:12.793 --> 00:09:15.070
even if you just oppose factory farming.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.375
Seventy-five percent of people think

00:09:17.405 --> 00:09:20.740
they usually eat meat from animals
who were treated humanely,

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.157
but as we saw earlier,

00:09:22.177 --> 00:09:26.440
less than 1% of farmed animals
actually live on non-factory farms.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.725
That's crazy, right?

00:09:27.755 --> 00:09:29.930
Why are consumers so confused?

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.462
Well, when we eat animals,

00:09:32.492 --> 00:09:35.329
there's a cognitive dissonance
that claws at us

00:09:35.349 --> 00:09:38.590
because deep down,
we care about animals too.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.478
What seems to happen
is that our subconscious

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:46.210
protects us from this dissonance
by creating a psychological refuge.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.710
It tells us that, actually,
everything is okay,

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.506
that farmed animals are treated well,

00:09:50.526 --> 00:09:53.401
even when the facts point
in the opposite direction.

00:09:53.431 --> 00:09:55.523
This mistaken belief protects us

00:09:55.553 --> 00:09:59.049
from the conflict between
our values and our behavior.

00:09:59.359 --> 00:10:01.489
And the misleading labels
on animal products,

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:05.109
like pictures of green pastures
on cartons of factory farm eggs,

00:10:05.139 --> 00:10:07.019
exacerbate this issue.

00:10:07.749 --> 00:10:08.730
Finally,

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.519
these farms are just too expensive
to feed this hungry planet.

00:10:12.539 --> 00:10:14.340
So-called humane animal products

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.750
are already several times
the normal price.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.689
Many of us just can't afford that.

00:10:18.709 --> 00:10:22.908
And the demand on natural resources
is just too much for this planet to bear,

00:10:23.298 --> 00:10:28.343
especially when we can get the same foods
from more sustainable sources.

00:10:29.569 --> 00:10:32.979
Fortunately, the future is bright.

00:10:33.009 --> 00:10:35.030
Today, we're at an inflection point,

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.859
where the moral reasons to change
our food system are very compelling.

00:10:38.879 --> 00:10:40.599
Technology is on its way

00:10:40.629 --> 00:10:43.192
and excellent alternatives
are already here,

00:10:43.222 --> 00:10:47.288
and advocates are wising up
to more impactful strategies.

00:10:47.308 --> 00:10:51.043
It's incredibly empowering to have
this wealth of evidence available,

00:10:51.073 --> 00:10:54.177
from history, psychology and elsewhere,

00:10:54.197 --> 00:10:57.721
to analyze using the effective
altruism perspective.

00:10:57.751 --> 00:10:59.737
Ultimately, that evidence suggests

00:10:59.757 --> 00:11:03.187
that we can achieve
a truly humane food system

00:11:03.217 --> 00:11:06.135
if we strive towards the end
of animal farming.

00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:10.047
And public opinion is already
a lot further along on this

00:11:10.067 --> 00:11:11.476
than you might think.

00:11:11.496 --> 00:11:13.609
Forty-seven percent of US adults

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:17.462
already say they support a ban
on slaughter houses.

00:11:18.169 --> 00:11:19.558
As we transition,

00:11:19.578 --> 00:11:22.644
as we align our food system
with our values,

00:11:22.664 --> 00:11:24.375
we're going to see a sweeping change

00:11:24.405 --> 00:11:28.855
in the relationship between humans
and the other inhabitants of this planet.

00:11:28.885 --> 00:11:31.483
Once we're no longer
eating animals three times a day,

00:11:31.503 --> 00:11:34.205
we'll see a huge relief
in cognitive dissonance

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:37.590
that frees our conscience
to expand our moral circle

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.279
to not just farmed animals,

00:11:39.309 --> 00:11:42.400
but other populations
like dogs and cats in shelters,

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.759
animals used in circuses
and entertainment,

00:11:44.789 --> 00:11:48.085
and the vast number of wild animals
who also need our help.

00:11:48.626 --> 00:11:52.351
Today, we're laying the foundation
for future social movements

00:11:52.371 --> 00:11:56.378
just as social movements of the past
laid the bedrock we now stand on.

00:11:57.198 --> 00:11:58.649
Richard Branson predicted

00:11:58.679 --> 00:12:02.792
that the food system
will be animal-free in just 30 years.

00:12:02.812 --> 00:12:07.496
It might take a little longer than that,
but it's clear that huge change is coming.

00:12:07.529 --> 00:12:12.179
You can stand on the right side of history
and play a role in this exciting movement,

00:12:12.209 --> 00:12:14.052
whether it's by starting a business

00:12:14.072 --> 00:12:16.950
like a local restaurant
or a clean-meat company,

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.830
becoming an activist, making a donation,

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.758
or simply sharing content on social media.

00:12:22.788 --> 00:12:25.939
You can, of course, also participate
as a conscious consumer,

00:12:25.969 --> 00:12:28.198
but keep in mind that your own diet choice

00:12:28.218 --> 00:12:30.828
is just one of many ways
to have an impact.

00:12:30.858 --> 00:12:34.518
This is a time of unbridled
excitement and opportunity,

00:12:34.548 --> 00:12:38.228
as we look ahead at one
of the next great social movements.

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:41.765
Humanity's moral circle
will continue to expand,

00:12:41.785 --> 00:12:45.848
but only if people
like you and me take hold.

00:12:46.268 --> 00:12:47.578
Thank you.

00:12:47.608 --> 00:12:49.234
(Applause)
