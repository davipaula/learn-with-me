00:00:07.234 --> 00:00:10.725
For most jobs, it's understood
that you can be fired,

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:11.954
whether for crime,

00:00:11.954 --> 00:00:13.087
incompetence,

00:00:13.087 --> 00:00:15.885
or just poor performance.

00:00:15.885 --> 00:00:20.657
But what if your job happens to be
the most powerful position in the country,

00:00:20.657 --> 00:00:22.506
or the world?

00:00:22.506 --> 00:00:24.887
That's where impeachment comes in.

00:00:24.887 --> 00:00:29.317
Impeachment isn't the same
as actually removing someone from office.

00:00:29.317 --> 00:00:32.191
Like an indictment in criminal court,

00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:36.357
it's only the formal accusation 
that launches a trial,

00:00:36.357 --> 00:00:39.826
which could end in conviction
or acquittal.

00:00:39.826 --> 00:00:41.656
Originating in the United Kingdom,

00:00:41.656 --> 00:00:47.887
impeachment allowed Parliament to vote for
removing a government official from office

00:00:47.887 --> 00:00:50.398
even without the king's consent.

00:00:50.398 --> 00:00:53.547
Although this was an important check
on royal power,

00:00:53.547 --> 00:00:55.867
the king couldn't be impeached

00:00:55.867 --> 00:00:59.997
because the monarch was considered
the source of all government power.

00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:02.577
But for the founders 
of the American Republic,

00:01:02.577 --> 00:01:06.927
there was no higher authority
beyond the people themselves.

00:01:06.927 --> 00:01:11.407
And so impeachment was adopted in
the United States as a power of Congress

00:01:11.407 --> 00:01:17.028
applying to any civil officers,
up to and including the president.

00:01:17.028 --> 00:01:21.039
Although demands for impeachment
can come from any members of the public,

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:26.539
only the House of Representatives has the
power to actually initiate the process.

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:29.630
It begins by referring the matter
to a committee,

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.940
usually the House Committee on Rules

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.659
and the House Committee on the Judiciary.

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.900
These committees review the accusations,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.369
examine the evidence,

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.890
and issue a recommendation.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.410
If they find sufficient 
grounds to proceed,

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.059
the House holds a separate vote
on each of the specific charges,

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:50.781
known as Articles of Impeachment.

00:01:50.781 --> 00:01:53.750
If one or more passes 
by a simple majority,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.832
the official is impeached
and the stage is set for trial.

00:01:58.832 --> 00:02:03.151
The actual trial that follows impeachment
is held in the Senate.

00:02:03.151 --> 00:02:08.449
Selected members of the House,
known as managers, act as the prosecution,

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:12.650
while the impeached official 
and their lawyers present their defense.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.589
The Senate acts as both judge and jury,

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:20.671
conducting the trial and deliberating
after hearing all the arguments.

00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:23.782
If it's the president or vice president
being impeached,

00:02:23.782 --> 00:02:27.413
the chief justice 
of the Supreme Court presides.

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:31.691
A conviction requires a supermajority
of two-thirds

00:02:31.691 --> 00:02:35.242
and results in automatic removal 
from power.

00:02:35.242 --> 00:02:37.182
Depending on the original charges,

00:02:37.182 --> 00:02:41.373
it can also disqualify them
from holding office in the future

00:02:41.373 --> 00:02:45.213
and open them to standard 
criminal prosecution.

00:02:45.213 --> 00:02:48.722
So what exactly can get someone impeached?

00:02:48.722 --> 00:02:50.483
That's a bit more complicated.

00:02:50.483 --> 00:02:52.413
Unlike in the United Kingdom,

00:02:52.413 --> 00:02:56.012
impeachment in the U.S. 
pits an elected legislature

00:02:56.012 --> 00:02:59.883
against other democratically 
elected members of government.

00:02:59.883 --> 00:03:03.947
Therefore, to prevent the process
from being used as a political weapon,

00:03:03.947 --> 00:03:07.655
the Constitution specifies that 
an official can only be impeached

00:03:07.655 --> 00:03:08.943
for treason,

00:03:08.943 --> 00:03:10.014
bribery,

00:03:10.014 --> 00:03:13.423
or other high crimes
and misdemeanors.

00:03:13.423 --> 00:03:16.444
That still leaves a lot of room 
for interpretation,

00:03:16.444 --> 00:03:18.064
not to mention politics,

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:22.833
and many impeachment trials
have split along partisan lines.

00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:28.734
But the process is generally understood to
be reserved for serious abuses of power.

00:03:28.734 --> 00:03:34.777
The first official to be impeached was
Tennesse Senator William Blount in 1797

00:03:34.777 --> 00:03:40.625
for conspiring with Britain to cease
the Spanish colony of Louisiana.

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:45.435
Since then, the House has launched
impeachment investigations about 60 times,

00:03:45.435 --> 00:03:50.336
but only 19 have led to actual
impeachment proceedings.

00:03:50.336 --> 00:03:53.866
The eight cases that ended
in a conviction and removal from office

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:55.896
were all federal judges.

00:03:55.896 --> 00:03:59.997
And impeachment of a sitting president
is even more rare.

00:03:59.997 --> 00:04:03.217
Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868

00:04:03.217 --> 00:04:07.007
for attempting to replace Secretary of War
Edwin Stanton

00:04:07.007 --> 00:04:09.436
without consulting the Senate.

00:04:09.436 --> 00:04:12.106
Over a century later, Bill Clinton 
was impeached

00:04:12.106 --> 00:04:17.226
for making false statements under oath
during a sexual harassment trial.

00:04:17.226 --> 00:04:21.017
Both were ultimately acquitted
when the Senate's votes to convict

00:04:21.017 --> 00:04:24.416
fell short of the required 
two-thirds majority.

00:04:24.416 --> 00:04:26.819
And contrary to popular belief,

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:31.766
Richard Nixon was never actually impeached
for the Watergate scandal.

00:04:31.766 --> 00:04:33.658
He resigned before it could happen

00:04:33.658 --> 00:04:37.146
knowing he would almost certainly
be convicted.

00:04:37.146 --> 00:04:40.209
Theoretically, the U.S. government is 
already designed

00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:42.017
to prevent abuses of power,

00:04:42.017 --> 00:04:45.738
limiting different branches
through a system of checks and balances,

00:04:45.738 --> 00:04:46.688
term limits,

00:04:46.688 --> 00:04:48.569
and free elections.

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.597
But impeachment can be seen
as an emergency brake

00:04:51.597 --> 00:04:54.469
for when these safeguards fail.
