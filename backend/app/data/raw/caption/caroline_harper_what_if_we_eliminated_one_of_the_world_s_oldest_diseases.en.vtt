00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.618
I'd like you to imagine,
just for a moment,

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:21.696
that your eyelashes grew inwards
instead of outwards,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.021
so that every time you blinked,

00:00:24.045 --> 00:00:27.141
they would scrape
the front of your eyeballs,

00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:28.942
damaging the corneas,

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:32.686
so that slowly and painfully,
you went blind.

00:00:33.307 --> 00:00:37.117
Well, that's what happens
to a person who has trachoma.

00:00:37.607 --> 00:00:42.776
Now, this little boy here, Pamelo,
from Zambia, he has trachoma.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.243
And if we don't do anything,
he's going to go blind.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.892
Trachoma is a curious disease.

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:53.076
It's a bacterial infection
that's passed from person to person

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.521
and by flies.

00:00:55.057 --> 00:00:58.871
The repeated infection
will scar your eyelids

00:00:58.895 --> 00:01:03.213
so that they contract
and they turn inside out.

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.791
It particularly affects women,

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:08.171
because they have
the contact with children.

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:12.093
So what you'll often see
in places like Ethiopia

00:01:12.117 --> 00:01:16.845
are girls who have tweezers
like this around their necks,

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.986
and they use them
to pluck out their eyelashes.

00:01:20.482 --> 00:01:23.126
But of course, that only gives them
temporary respite,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.709
because they just grow back
more vicious than before.

00:01:27.538 --> 00:01:31.616
There are around two million
people in the world

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.703
who are blind or visually impaired
because of trachoma.

00:01:35.283 --> 00:01:39.625
And we believe there may be
as many as 200 million people

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:40.799
who are at risk.

00:01:41.418 --> 00:01:43.703
Now, it's a very old disease.

00:01:44.188 --> 00:01:49.296
What you can see is a photo
of a wall of a tomb in Northern Sudan.

00:01:49.855 --> 00:01:52.827
A colleague and I were traveling
in a very remote village,

00:01:52.851 --> 00:01:56.388
and we asked an old man
to take us down into a little tomb.

00:01:56.955 --> 00:01:59.805
Now, on the wall, we saw two eyes.

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.145
One is crying,

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:03.757
and you can see
there are tweezers next to it.

00:02:04.127 --> 00:02:07.642
Simon said to me, "My God,
do you think that's trachoma?"

00:02:08.103 --> 00:02:11.169
So we sent this picture
to the British Museum,

00:02:11.523 --> 00:02:14.454
and they confirmed that, yes,
this is trachoma.

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.164
So, thousands of years ago,

00:02:17.188 --> 00:02:21.014
the ancient Nubians
were painting pictures of trachoma

00:02:21.038 --> 00:02:22.902
on the walls of their tomb.

00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:24.926
And the tragedy is

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.272
that disease is still rampant
in that area today.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.529
And the crazy thing is,
we know how to stop it.

00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:38.048
And what's great is that the trachoma
community have all come together

00:02:38.072 --> 00:02:39.837
to pool their efforts.

00:02:40.157 --> 00:02:43.299
We don't compete; we collaborate.

00:02:43.712 --> 00:02:45.916
I have to tell you,
that's not always the case

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.554
in my experience in the NGO world.

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:51.972
We've created something

00:02:51.996 --> 00:02:55.793
called the International Coalition
for Trachoma Control.

00:02:56.298 --> 00:03:00.222
And together, we've developed
a strategy to fight it.

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.664
This strategy is called the SAFE strategy,

00:03:03.688 --> 00:03:07.021
and it's been approved
by the World Health Organization.

00:03:07.434 --> 00:03:09.798
The "S" stands for "surgery."

00:03:10.292 --> 00:03:12.323
It's very straightforward procedure

00:03:12.347 --> 00:03:14.710
to turn the eyelids back the right way.

00:03:15.141 --> 00:03:17.141
We train nurses to do it,

00:03:17.165 --> 00:03:19.212
and they use local anesthetics.

00:03:19.236 --> 00:03:23.791
And as you can see, you can do it
in somebody's front porch, if need be.

00:03:24.688 --> 00:03:27.457
Then "A" stands for "antibiotics."

00:03:27.982 --> 00:03:30.760
These are donated by Pfizer,

00:03:30.784 --> 00:03:35.744
who also pay for those drugs
to be transported to the port in-country.

00:03:35.768 --> 00:03:39.054
From there, they're taken to the villages,

00:03:39.078 --> 00:03:43.895
where hundreds of thousands
of community volunteers

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.951
will distribute those drugs to the people.

00:03:47.696 --> 00:03:50.133
Now, we train those volunteers,

00:03:50.157 --> 00:03:54.221
and we also help the ministries
with all that complex logistics.

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.656
And every one of those volunteers
has a pole like this.

00:04:00.526 --> 00:04:02.260
It's called a "dose pole."

00:04:02.606 --> 00:04:04.272
This one's from Cameroon.

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:07.189
And you can see it's marked
different colors,

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:10.783
and you can tell how many pills
you should give somebody,

00:04:10.807 --> 00:04:12.607
based on how tall they are.

00:04:14.442 --> 00:04:16.881
"F" stands for "face washing."

00:04:17.498 --> 00:04:21.196
Now, we used to have trachoma
in the UK and in the US.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.212
In fact, President Carter,

00:04:23.236 --> 00:04:27.053
he talks about how trachoma
was a real problem in Georgia

00:04:27.077 --> 00:04:28.602
when he was a little boy.

00:04:29.046 --> 00:04:33.029
And in the UK, the famous
eye hospital, Moorfields,

00:04:33.053 --> 00:04:35.320
was originally a trachoma hospital.

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:41.886
What we do is teach kids like this
how important it is to wash their faces.

00:04:42.976 --> 00:04:45.976
And finally, "E" stands for "environment,"

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.880
where we help the communities
build latrines,

00:04:48.904 --> 00:04:52.753
and we teach them to separate
their animals from their living quarters

00:04:52.777 --> 00:04:55.377
in order to reduce the fly population.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.467
So we know how to tackle the disease.

00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:01.760
But we need to know where it is.

00:05:01.784 --> 00:05:03.158
And we do,

00:05:03.182 --> 00:05:07.785
because a few years ago,
Sightsavers led an incredible program

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:10.681
called the Global Trachoma
Mapping Project.

00:05:11.158 --> 00:05:13.463
It took us three years,

00:05:13.487 --> 00:05:16.840
but we went through 29 countries,

00:05:16.864 --> 00:05:21.912
and we taught local health workers
to go district by district,

00:05:21.936 --> 00:05:26.959
and they examined the eyelids
of over two and a half million people.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.297
And they used Android phones
in order to download the data.

00:05:31.776 --> 00:05:34.553
And from that, we were able to build a map

00:05:34.577 --> 00:05:37.101
that showed us where the disease was.

00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:39.547
Now, this is a very high-level map

00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:43.356
that shows you which countries
had a problem with trachoma.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.211
And you may ask me,
"Well, does this strategy actually work?"

00:05:47.634 --> 00:05:48.824
Yes, it does.

00:05:49.426 --> 00:05:52.779
This map shows you the progress
that we've made to date.

00:05:52.803 --> 00:05:56.875
The green countries believe
they've already eliminated trachoma,

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:59.883
and they have either been through
or are in the process of

00:05:59.907 --> 00:06:02.618
having that validated by the WHO.

00:06:02.642 --> 00:06:05.269
Countries in yellow
have the money they need,

00:06:05.293 --> 00:06:08.563
they have the resources
to eliminate trachoma.

00:06:08.937 --> 00:06:11.414
And some of them are really nearly there.

00:06:11.795 --> 00:06:14.874
But the red countries,
they don't have enough funding.

00:06:14.898 --> 00:06:18.263
They cannot eliminate trachoma
unless they get more.

00:06:18.721 --> 00:06:23.107
And we're quite concerned, though,
that the progress to date may stall.

00:06:23.857 --> 00:06:28.634
So when we were talking
to the Audacious ideas guys,

00:06:28.658 --> 00:06:30.444
we asked ourselves:

00:06:30.468 --> 00:06:34.936
If we really, really pushed ourselves
over the next four or five years

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.793
and we had the money,

00:06:36.817 --> 00:06:38.864
what do we think we could achieve?

00:06:39.523 --> 00:06:44.372
Well, we believe
that we can eliminate trachoma

00:06:44.396 --> 00:06:46.816
in 12 African countries

00:06:47.245 --> 00:06:50.421
and across the Americas

00:06:50.445 --> 00:06:52.697
and all across the Pacific.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.172
And we can make significant progress

00:06:56.196 --> 00:06:59.991
in two countries which have
the highest burden of the disease,

00:07:00.015 --> 00:07:02.785
which is Ethiopia and Nigeria.

00:07:03.237 --> 00:07:05.309
And in doing all of that,

00:07:05.333 --> 00:07:11.015
we can leverage more than two
billion dollars' worth of donated drugs.

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:17.253
(Applause)

00:07:17.277 --> 00:07:20.053
Now, this map here shows you
the impact that we'll have --

00:07:20.077 --> 00:07:22.395
look how many countries are going green.

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:25.467
And there, you can see progress
in Ethiopia and Nigeria.

00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:28.412
Now, yes, there are some countries
that are still red.

00:07:28.436 --> 00:07:31.237
These are mainly countries
which are in conflict --

00:07:31.261 --> 00:07:35.050
places like Yemen, South Sudan --
where it's very difficult to work.

00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:40.340
So, we have the team,
the strategy and the map.

00:07:40.364 --> 00:07:44.436
And we also have the relationships
with the governments

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.362
so that we can make sure
that our program is coordinated

00:07:48.386 --> 00:07:50.673
with other disease-control programs,

00:07:50.697 --> 00:07:52.564
so that we can be efficient.

00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:57.680
Wouldn't it be amazing
if we could do this?

00:07:57.704 --> 00:07:59.958
We'd have trachoma on the run.

00:07:59.982 --> 00:08:02.317
We would be on the home straight

00:08:02.341 --> 00:08:05.715
to eliminate this disease
from the whole world.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.713
But before I finish,
I just want to share with you

00:08:09.737 --> 00:08:12.240
some words from
the founder of Sightsavers,

00:08:12.264 --> 00:08:14.547
a guy called Sir John Wilson.

00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:16.964
Now, he was blinded at the age of 12.

00:08:16.988 --> 00:08:18.285
And he said,

00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:20.909
"People don't go blind by the million.

00:08:21.468 --> 00:08:24.166
They go blind one by one."

00:08:24.658 --> 00:08:27.202
And in the excitement of being able to say

00:08:27.226 --> 00:08:30.650
we've got rid of trachoma
for the whole country,

00:08:30.674 --> 00:08:35.293
let's not forget that, actually,
this is a devastating disease

00:08:35.317 --> 00:08:38.355
that destroys the lives
of individual people.

00:08:39.156 --> 00:08:40.657
People like Twiba.

00:08:40.681 --> 00:08:43.281
Now, I met Twiba last year in Tanzania.

00:08:43.618 --> 00:08:46.863
She had had trachoma
for as long as she could remember.

00:08:46.887 --> 00:08:50.293
And a couple of months before I met her,
she'd had the operation.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.134
It's no exaggeration to say

00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:56.451
that this had totally
transformed her life.

00:08:57.198 --> 00:09:01.181
We'd saved the sight that she had left,
and she was free of pain.

00:09:01.515 --> 00:09:03.047
She could sleep.

00:09:03.071 --> 00:09:05.229
She could work, she could socialize.

00:09:05.848 --> 00:09:07.148
And she said to me,

00:09:08.222 --> 00:09:10.110
"I have my life back."

00:09:10.587 --> 00:09:14.053
And it was impossible
not to be moved by her story.

00:09:14.445 --> 00:09:16.762
But there are so many Twibas.

00:09:16.786 --> 00:09:19.326
I want to find all the Twibas,

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.622
and I don't want anyone
to go blind in agony anymore.

00:09:23.138 --> 00:09:28.303
Now, you know, there are so many
intractable problems in this world.

00:09:29.333 --> 00:09:31.053
But this is not one of them.

00:09:31.602 --> 00:09:34.554
This is something that we can solve.

00:09:34.983 --> 00:09:36.483
And we can ensure

00:09:36.507 --> 00:09:41.775
that kids like this can grow up
free from the fear of trachoma.

00:09:42.261 --> 00:09:45.626
So, for the sake of kids like this,

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.037
and for the sake of people like Twiba,

00:09:48.849 --> 00:09:51.352
let's get rid of trachoma.

00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:54.502
Do you think we can?

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.677
Well, yeah, if we really, really want to.

00:09:58.121 --> 00:09:59.607
Yes, we can.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.227
So thank you.

00:10:01.251 --> 00:10:06.758
(Applause)
