00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.906
I want to talk to you about
how to build and rebuild trust,

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.699
because it's my belief that trust

00:00:20.723 --> 00:00:24.649
is the foundation for everything we do,

00:00:24.673 --> 00:00:29.102
and that if we can learn
to trust one another more,

00:00:29.126 --> 00:00:32.220
we can have unprecedented human progress.

00:00:35.277 --> 00:00:37.099
But what if trust is broken?

00:00:38.531 --> 00:00:43.634
What if your CEO is caught on video,
disparaging an employee?

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:52.392
What if your employees experience
a culture of bias, exclusion and worse?

00:00:53.742 --> 00:00:55.924
What if there's a data breach,

00:00:55.948 --> 00:01:01.194
and it feels an awful lot like a cover-up
than seriously addressing it?

00:01:02.808 --> 00:01:04.681
And most tragically,

00:01:04.705 --> 00:01:09.459
what if a technological fail
leads to the loss of human life?

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.312
If I was giving this talk six months ago,

00:01:13.336 --> 00:01:15.844
I would have been wearing an Uber T-shirt.

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.747
I'm a Harvard Business School professor,

00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:25.495
but I was super attracted
to going to an organization

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:30.818
that was metaphorically
and perhaps quite literally on fire.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.190
I had read everything
that was written in the newspaper,

00:01:35.214 --> 00:01:39.271
and that was precisely what drew me
to the organization.

00:01:39.295 --> 00:01:42.866
This was an organization
that had lost trust

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.177
with every constituent that mattered.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.150
But there's a word about me
that I should share.

00:01:50.174 --> 00:01:52.642
My favorite trait is redemption.

00:01:54.064 --> 00:01:58.975
I believe that there is a better
version of us around every corner,

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:00.838
and I have seen firsthand

00:02:00.862 --> 00:02:03.540
how organizations and communities

00:02:03.564 --> 00:02:06.755
and individuals change
at breathtaking speed.

00:02:08.467 --> 00:02:12.697
I went to Uber with the hopes
that a turnaround there

00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:15.303
could give license to the rest of us

00:02:15.327 --> 00:02:18.986
who might have narrower versions
of their challenges.

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:24.776
But when I got to Uber,
I made a really big mistake.

00:02:26.343 --> 00:02:31.620
I publicly committed
to wearing an Uber T-shirt every day

00:02:31.644 --> 00:02:34.778
until every other employee
was wearing an Uber T-shirt.

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.038
I had clearly not thought that through.

00:02:39.062 --> 00:02:40.710
(Laughter)

00:02:40.734 --> 00:02:45.143
It was 250 days
of wearing an Uber T-shirt.

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:50.498
Now I am liberated from that commitment,

00:02:50.522 --> 00:02:52.721
as I am back at HBS,

00:02:52.745 --> 00:02:56.930
and what I'd like to do is share with you

00:02:56.954 --> 00:03:01.055
how far I have taken that liberty,

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.174
which, it's baby steps,

00:03:04.198 --> 00:03:05.428
(Laughter)

00:03:05.452 --> 00:03:07.459
but I would just say I'm on my way.

00:03:07.483 --> 00:03:09.199
(Laughter)

00:03:09.223 --> 00:03:12.787
Now, trust, if we're going to rebuild it,

00:03:12.811 --> 00:03:15.427
we have to understand its component parts.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.748
The component parts of trust
are super well understood.

00:03:19.772 --> 00:03:22.462
There's three things about trust.

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:28.733
If you sense that I am being authentic,

00:03:28.757 --> 00:03:30.999
you are much more likely to trust me.

00:03:32.147 --> 00:03:37.695
If you sense that I have
real rigor in my logic,

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:39.861
you are far more likely to trust me.

00:03:40.528 --> 00:03:45.441
And if you believe that my empathy
is directed towards you,

00:03:45.465 --> 00:03:47.692
you are far more likely to trust me.

00:03:48.303 --> 00:03:51.104
When all three
of these things are working,

00:03:51.128 --> 00:03:53.247
we have great trust.

00:03:54.165 --> 00:03:57.539
But if any one of these three gets shaky,

00:03:57.563 --> 00:04:01.188
if any one of these three wobbles,

00:04:01.212 --> 00:04:02.648
trust is threatened.

00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:06.047
Now here's what I'd like to do.

00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:11.228
I want each of us to be able
to engender more trust tomorrow,

00:04:11.252 --> 00:04:13.744
literally tomorrow, than we do today.

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:21.158
And the way to do that is to understand
where trust wobbles for ourselves

00:04:21.182 --> 00:04:23.864
and have a ready-made
prescription to overcome it.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.650
So that's what I would like
to do together.

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.936
Would you give me some sense
of whether or not you're here voluntarily?

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.047
(Laughter)

00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:35.435
Yeah. OK. Alright. Awesome.

00:04:35.459 --> 00:04:36.969
OK. So --

00:04:36.993 --> 00:04:38.333
(Laughter)

00:04:38.357 --> 00:04:40.123
it's just super helpful feedback.

00:04:40.147 --> 00:04:42.433
(Laughter)

00:04:42.457 --> 00:04:47.512
So the most common wobble is empathy.

00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:50.386
The most common wobble

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.392
is that people just don't believe
that we're mostly in it for them,

00:04:55.416 --> 00:04:58.588
and they believe
that we're too self-distracted.

00:04:59.423 --> 00:05:00.981
And it's no wonder.

00:05:01.005 --> 00:05:04.613
We are all so busy
with so many demands on our time,

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:08.334
it's easy to crowd out the time and space

00:05:08.358 --> 00:05:10.859
that empathy requires.

00:05:10.883 --> 00:05:13.819
For Dylan to be Dylan,
that takes real time.

00:05:15.276 --> 00:05:20.442
And for us, if we have too much to do,
we may not have that time.

00:05:20.466 --> 00:05:22.965
But that puts us into a vicious cycle,

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:25.735
because without revealing empathy,

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:27.974
it makes everything harder.

00:05:27.998 --> 00:05:31.665
Without the benefit of the doubt of trust,
it makes everything harder,

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:35.498
and then we have less and less time
for empathy, and so it goes.

00:05:36.232 --> 00:05:37.720
So here's the prescription:

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:46.351
identify where, when and to whom

00:05:46.375 --> 00:05:49.025
you are likely to offer your distraction.

00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:54.249
That should trace pretty perfectly

00:05:54.273 --> 00:05:59.709
to when, where and to whom
you are likely to withhold your empathy.

00:06:01.123 --> 00:06:03.724
And if in those instances,

00:06:03.748 --> 00:06:09.993
we can come up with a trigger
that gets us to look up,

00:06:10.017 --> 00:06:13.140
look at the people right in front of us,

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:14.973
listen to them,

00:06:14.997 --> 00:06:19.137
deeply immerse ourselves
in their perspectives,

00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:24.114
then we have a chance of having
a sturdy leg of empathy.

00:06:24.811 --> 00:06:26.636
And if you do nothing else,

00:06:27.902 --> 00:06:31.165
please put away your cell phone.

00:06:31.787 --> 00:06:36.776
It is the largest distraction magnet
yet to be made,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.305
and it is super difficult to create
empathy and trust in its presence.

00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:46.251
That takes care of the empathy wobblers.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.331
Logic wobbles can come in two forms.

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:55.223
It's either the quality of your logic

00:06:56.752 --> 00:06:59.969
or it's your ability
to communicate the logic.

00:07:00.777 --> 00:07:04.483
Now if the quality
of your logic is at risk,

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:06.135
I can't really help you with that.

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:07.498
(Laughter)

00:07:07.522 --> 00:07:09.167
It's like, not in this much time.

00:07:09.191 --> 00:07:12.654
(Laughter)

00:07:12.678 --> 00:07:17.758
But fortunately, it's often the case
that our logic is sound,

00:07:17.782 --> 00:07:23.271
but it's our ability to communicate
the logic that is in jeopardy.

00:07:23.295 --> 00:07:26.873
Super fortunately,
there's a very easy fix to this.

00:07:27.673 --> 00:07:33.643
If we consider that there are
two ways to communicate in the world,

00:07:33.667 --> 00:07:36.810
and Harvard Business School professors
are known for two-by-twos --

00:07:36.834 --> 00:07:39.302
nonsense, it's the triangle that rocks.

00:07:39.326 --> 00:07:41.482
(Laughter)

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:47.012
If we consider that there are
two ways to communicate in the world,

00:07:47.036 --> 00:07:51.650
and the first one is when
you take us on a journey,

00:07:51.674 --> 00:07:56.657
a magnificent journey
that has twists and turns

00:07:56.681 --> 00:07:59.813
and mystery and drama,

00:07:59.837 --> 00:08:02.324
until you ultimately get to the point,

00:08:03.536 --> 00:08:06.612
and some of the best
communicators in the world

00:08:06.636 --> 00:08:08.667
communicate just like this.

00:08:09.432 --> 00:08:11.964
But if you have a logic wobble,

00:08:11.988 --> 00:08:14.170
this can be super dangerous.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.136
So instead, I implore you,

00:08:19.856 --> 00:08:25.079
start with your point
in a crisp half-sentence,

00:08:25.103 --> 00:08:28.079
and then give your supporting evidence.

00:08:29.777 --> 00:08:32.194
This means that people
will be able to get access

00:08:32.218 --> 00:08:34.411
to our awesome ideas,

00:08:34.435 --> 00:08:36.077
and just as importantly,

00:08:37.585 --> 00:08:40.227
if you get cut off before you're done ...

00:08:41.894 --> 00:08:43.322
ladies --

00:08:43.346 --> 00:08:45.941
(Laughter)

00:08:45.965 --> 00:08:52.770
(Applause)

00:08:52.794 --> 00:08:56.217
If you get cut off before you're done,

00:08:56.241 --> 00:08:58.160
you still get credit for the idea,

00:08:58.184 --> 00:09:01.741
as opposed to someone else coming in
and snatching it from you.

00:09:01.765 --> 00:09:08.335
(Applause)

00:09:08.359 --> 00:09:09.693
You just gave me goosebumps.

00:09:09.717 --> 00:09:11.193
(Laughter)

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.269
The third wobble is authenticity,
and I find it to be the most vexing.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.104
We as a human species
can sniff out in a moment,

00:09:21.128 --> 00:09:23.116
literally in a moment,

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:26.164
whether or not someone
is being their authentic true self.

00:09:27.705 --> 00:09:29.990
So in many ways,
the prescription is clear.

00:09:30.948 --> 00:09:34.174
You don't want to have
an authenticity wobble? Be you.

00:09:35.675 --> 00:09:36.881
Great.

00:09:38.255 --> 00:09:40.525
And that is super easy to do

00:09:40.549 --> 00:09:43.890
when you're around people
who are like you.

00:09:45.817 --> 00:09:49.317
But if you represent
any sort of difference,

00:09:50.659 --> 00:09:55.206
the prescription to "be you"
can be super challenging.

00:09:57.905 --> 00:10:01.996
I have been tempted
at every step of my career,

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:05.293
tempted personally
and tempted by coaching of others,

00:10:05.317 --> 00:10:07.563
to mute who I am in the world.

00:10:08.688 --> 00:10:11.738
I'm a woman of super strong opinions,

00:10:11.762 --> 00:10:14.397
with really deep convictions,

00:10:14.421 --> 00:10:16.037
direct speech.

00:10:16.602 --> 00:10:19.236
I have a magnificent wife,

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.529
and together, we have such crazy ambition.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:25.807
I prefer men's clothes

00:10:26.743 --> 00:10:28.267
and comfortable shoes.

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:30.457
Thank you, Allbirds.

00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:33.618
(Laughter)

00:10:33.642 --> 00:10:37.102
In some contexts, this makes me different.

00:10:38.229 --> 00:10:40.321
I hope that each person here

00:10:40.345 --> 00:10:44.121
has the beautiful luxury
of representing difference

00:10:44.145 --> 00:10:45.998
in some context in your life.

00:10:47.295 --> 00:10:49.043
But with that privilege

00:10:50.154 --> 00:10:55.911
comes a very sincere temptation
to hold back who we are,

00:10:55.935 --> 00:10:58.302
and if we hold back who we are,

00:10:58.326 --> 00:11:00.395
we're less likely to be trusted.

00:11:00.419 --> 00:11:02.332
And if we're less likely to be trusted,

00:11:02.356 --> 00:11:05.109
we're less likely to be given
stretch assignments.

00:11:05.133 --> 00:11:08.562
And without those stretch assignments,
we're less likely to get promoted,

00:11:08.586 --> 00:11:12.134
and so on and so on
until we are super depressed

00:11:12.158 --> 00:11:15.065
by the demographic tendencies
of our senior leadership.

00:11:15.518 --> 00:11:16.966
(Laughter)

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:23.746
And it all comes back
to our being our authentic selves.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.989
So here's my advice.

00:11:26.013 --> 00:11:28.712
Wear whatever makes you feel fabulous.

00:11:30.434 --> 00:11:34.725
Pay less attention to what you think
people want to hear from you

00:11:34.749 --> 00:11:39.712
and far more attention to what
your authentic, awesome self needs to say.

00:11:41.127 --> 00:11:42.990
And to the leaders in the room,

00:11:44.379 --> 00:11:46.555
it is your obligation

00:11:46.579 --> 00:11:51.745
to set the conditions that not only
make it safe for us to be authentic

00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:53.182
but make it welcome,

00:11:54.713 --> 00:11:56.356
make it celebrated,

00:11:56.975 --> 00:12:00.516
cherish it for exactly what it is,

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.902
which is the key for us
achieving greater excellence

00:12:03.926 --> 00:12:06.265
than we have ever known is possible.

00:12:08.416 --> 00:12:11.716
So let's go back to Uber.
What happened at Uber?

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.918
When I got there,
Uber was wobbling all over the place.

00:12:16.913 --> 00:12:21.056
Empathy, logic, authenticity
were all wobbling like crazy.

00:12:22.528 --> 00:12:28.385
But we were able to find super effective,
super quick fixes for two of the wobbles.

00:12:29.636 --> 00:12:32.199
I'll give you an illustration of empathy.

00:12:32.223 --> 00:12:33.597
In the meetings at Uber,

00:12:33.621 --> 00:12:37.605
it was not uncommon
for people to be texting one another ...

00:12:38.965 --> 00:12:40.156
about the meeting.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:45.932
(Laughter)

00:12:45.956 --> 00:12:48.226
I had never seen anything like it.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:49.678
(Laughter)

00:12:50.305 --> 00:12:51.743
It may have done many things,

00:12:51.767 --> 00:12:55.241
but it did not create a safe,
empathetic environment.

00:12:55.612 --> 00:12:58.016
The solution though, super clear:

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.770
technology, off and away.

00:13:00.886 --> 00:13:03.568
And that forced people to look up,

00:13:03.592 --> 00:13:06.244
to look at the people in front of them,

00:13:06.268 --> 00:13:07.666
to listen to them,

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:09.769
to immerse themselves
in their perspectives

00:13:09.793 --> 00:13:13.213
and to collaborate in unprecedented ways.

00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:18.749
Logic was equally wobbly,

00:13:18.773 --> 00:13:21.670
and this was because
the hypergrowth of the organization

00:13:21.694 --> 00:13:24.361
meant that people, managers
were getting promoted

00:13:24.385 --> 00:13:26.523
again and again and again.

00:13:27.281 --> 00:13:30.988
Soon, they were put in positions
that they had no business being in.

00:13:31.818 --> 00:13:34.124
Their positions outstripped
their capability,

00:13:34.148 --> 00:13:35.635
and it was not their fault.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.330
The solution: a massive influx
of executive education

00:13:41.354 --> 00:13:45.012
that focused specifically on logic,

00:13:45.036 --> 00:13:47.227
on strategy and leadership.

00:13:48.119 --> 00:13:51.563
It gave people the rigor
of the quality of their logic,

00:13:51.587 --> 00:13:56.747
and it turned a whole lot
of triangles, right-side up,

00:13:56.771 --> 00:14:00.000
so people were able to communicate
effectively with one another.

00:14:01.554 --> 00:14:06.093
The last one, authenticity,
I'll say it's still mighty wobbly,

00:14:07.173 --> 00:14:09.642
but honestly, that doesn't
make Uber very different

00:14:09.666 --> 00:14:13.196
from all of the other companies
I've seen in Silicon Valley and beyond.

00:14:15.194 --> 00:14:19.726
It is still much easier
to coach people to fit in.

00:14:20.627 --> 00:14:23.706
It is still much easier to reward people

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.117
when they say something
that you were going to say,

00:14:27.141 --> 00:14:29.673
as opposed to rewarding people
when they say something

00:14:29.697 --> 00:14:32.426
entirely different
than what you were going to say.

00:14:34.157 --> 00:14:36.676
But when we figure out this,

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.370
when we figure out
how to celebrate difference

00:14:40.394 --> 00:14:43.965
and how to let people bring
the best version of themselves forward,

00:14:43.989 --> 00:14:48.430
well holy cow, is that the world
I want my sons to grow up in.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.296
And with the collection of people here,

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.449
it would be a privilege
to lock arms with you

00:14:54.473 --> 00:14:58.004
and go ahead and rebuild trust
in every corner of the globe.

00:14:58.838 --> 00:14:59.989
Thank you very much.

00:15:00.013 --> 00:15:04.611
(Applause)
