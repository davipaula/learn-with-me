00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:15.368
So, robots.

00:00:15.392 --> 00:00:16.806
Robots can be programmed

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.521
to do the same task millions of times
with minimal error,

00:00:20.545 --> 00:00:23.059
something very difficult for us, right?

00:00:23.083 --> 00:00:26.244
And it can be very impressive
to watch them at work.

00:00:26.268 --> 00:00:27.524
Look at them.

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:29.456
I could watch them for hours.

00:00:30.108 --> 00:00:31.407
No?

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.638
What is less impressive

00:00:33.662 --> 00:00:36.595
is that if you take these robots
out of the factories,

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:40.999
where the environments are not
perfectly known and measured like here,

00:00:41.023 --> 00:00:45.301
to do even a simple task
which doesn't require much precision,

00:00:45.325 --> 00:00:46.936
this is what can happen.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.689
I mean, opening a door,
you don't require much precision.

00:00:49.713 --> 00:00:50.743
(Laughter)

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:53.221
Or a small error in the measurements,

00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:55.071
he misses the valve, and that's it --

00:00:55.095 --> 00:00:56.365
(Laughter)

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:58.833
with no way of recovering,
most of the time.

00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:01.236
So why is that?

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.134
Well, for many years,

00:01:03.158 --> 00:01:06.458
robots have been designed
to emphasize speed and precision,

00:01:06.482 --> 00:01:09.444
and this translates
into a very specific architecture.

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:10.619
If you take a robot arm,

00:01:10.643 --> 00:01:13.402
it's a very well-defined
set of rigid links

00:01:13.426 --> 00:01:15.485
and motors, what we call actuators,

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.279
they move the links about the joints.

00:01:17.303 --> 00:01:18.610
In this robotic structure,

00:01:18.624 --> 00:01:20.851
you have to perfectly
measure your environment,

00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:22.762
so what is around,

00:01:22.786 --> 00:01:25.425
and you have to perfectly
program every movement

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:27.584
of the robot joints,

00:01:27.608 --> 00:01:30.870
because a small error
can generate a very large fault,

00:01:30.894 --> 00:01:33.907
so you can damage something
or you can get your robot damaged

00:01:33.931 --> 00:01:35.462
if something is harder.

00:01:36.107 --> 00:01:38.312
So let's talk about them a moment.

00:01:38.336 --> 00:01:41.559
And don't think
about the brains of these robots

00:01:41.583 --> 00:01:44.328
or how carefully we program them,

00:01:44.352 --> 00:01:46.170
but rather look at their bodies.

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:49.485
There is obviously
something wrong with it,

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.636
because what makes a robot
precise and strong

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.049
also makes them ridiculously dangerous
and ineffective in the real world,

00:01:57.073 --> 00:01:59.058
because their body cannot deform

00:01:59.082 --> 00:02:02.311
or better adjust to the interaction
with the real world.

00:02:03.226 --> 00:02:06.344
So think about the opposite approach,

00:02:06.368 --> 00:02:09.186
being softer than
anything else around you.

00:02:09.827 --> 00:02:14.912
Well, maybe you think that you're not
really able to do anything if you're soft,

00:02:14.936 --> 00:02:16.103
probably.

00:02:16.127 --> 00:02:18.977
Well, nature teaches us the opposite.

00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:21.032
For example, at the bottom of the ocean,

00:02:21.056 --> 00:02:23.492
under thousands of pounds
of hydrostatic pressure,

00:02:23.516 --> 00:02:25.944
a completely soft animal

00:02:25.968 --> 00:02:29.245
can move and interact
with a much stiffer object than him.

00:02:29.878 --> 00:02:32.725
He walks by carrying around
this coconut shell

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:35.133
thanks to the flexibility
of his tentacles,

00:02:35.157 --> 00:02:37.661
which serve as both his feet and hands.

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:42.066
And apparently,
an octopus can also open a jar.

00:02:43.883 --> 00:02:45.637
It's pretty impressive, right?

00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:52.418
But clearly, this is not enabled
just by the brain of this animal,

00:02:52.442 --> 00:02:54.456
but also by his body,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.512
and it's a clear example,
maybe the clearest example,

00:02:58.536 --> 00:03:00.336
of embodied intelligence,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.646
which is a kind of intelligence
that all living organisms have.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.236
We all have that.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.102
Our body, its shape,
material and structure,

00:03:09.126 --> 00:03:12.308
plays a fundamental role
during a physical task,

00:03:12.332 --> 00:03:17.945
because we can conform to our environment

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:20.373
so we can succeed in a large
variety of situations

00:03:20.397 --> 00:03:23.390
without much planning
or calculations ahead.

00:03:23.414 --> 00:03:26.129
So why don't we put
some of this embodied intelligence

00:03:26.153 --> 00:03:27.708
into our robotic machines,

00:03:27.732 --> 00:03:30.081
to release them from relying
on excessive work

00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:32.122
on computation and sensing?

00:03:33.097 --> 00:03:35.747
Well, to do that, we can follow
the strategy of nature,

00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:38.383
because with evolution,
she's done a pretty good job

00:03:38.407 --> 00:03:42.903
in designing machines
for environment interaction.

00:03:42.927 --> 00:03:47.421
And it's easy to notice that nature
uses soft material frequently

00:03:47.445 --> 00:03:49.740
and stiff material sparingly.

00:03:49.764 --> 00:03:53.556
And this is what is done
in this new field of robotics,

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.880
which is called "soft robotics,"

00:03:55.904 --> 00:03:59.640
in which the main objective
is not to make super-precise machines,

00:03:59.664 --> 00:04:01.601
because we've already got them,

00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:06.545
but to make robots able to face
unexpected situations in the real world,

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.126
so able to go out there.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.674
And what makes a robot soft
is first of all its compliant body,

00:04:11.698 --> 00:04:17.229
which is made of materials or structures
that can undergo very large deformations,

00:04:17.253 --> 00:04:19.084
so no more rigid links,

00:04:19.108 --> 00:04:22.656
and secondly, to move them,
we use what we call distributed actuation,

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.712
so we have to control continuously
the shape of this very deformable body,

00:04:27.736 --> 00:04:31.034
which has the effect
of having a lot of links and joints,

00:04:31.058 --> 00:04:33.681
but we don't have
any stiff structure at all.

00:04:33.705 --> 00:04:37.135
So you can imagine that building
a soft robot is a very different process

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.039
than stiff robotics,
where you have links, gears, screws

00:04:40.063 --> 00:04:42.294
that you must combine
in a very defined way.

00:04:42.948 --> 00:04:46.473
In soft robots, you just build
your actuator from scratch

00:04:46.497 --> 00:04:47.648
most of the time,

00:04:47.672 --> 00:04:50.054
but you shape your flexible material

00:04:50.078 --> 00:04:52.481
to the form that responds
to a certain input.

00:04:53.054 --> 00:04:55.512
For example, here,
you can just deform a structure

00:04:55.536 --> 00:04:58.007
doing a fairly complex shape

00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:01.309
if you think about doing the same
with rigid links and joints,

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:03.666
and here, what you use is just one input,

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.054
such as air pressure.

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:09.358
OK, but let's see
some cool examples of soft robots.

00:05:09.765 --> 00:05:14.312
Here is a little cute guy
developed at Harvard University,

00:05:14.336 --> 00:05:18.829
and he walks thanks to waves
of pressure applied along its body,

00:05:18.853 --> 00:05:22.139
and thanks to the flexibility,
he can also sneak under a low bridge,

00:05:22.163 --> 00:05:23.314
keep walking,

00:05:23.338 --> 00:05:26.535
and then keep walking
a little bit different afterwards.

00:05:27.345 --> 00:05:29.576
And it's a very preliminary prototype,

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.276
but they also built a more robust version
with power on board

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.747
that can actually be sent out in the world
and face real-world interactions

00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:40.477
like a car passing it over it ...

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.240
and keep working.

00:05:44.056 --> 00:05:45.207
It's cute.

00:05:45.231 --> 00:05:46.652
(Laughter)

00:05:46.676 --> 00:05:50.540
Or a robotic fish, which swims
like a real fish does in water

00:05:50.564 --> 00:05:53.748
simply because it has a soft tail
with distributed actuation

00:05:53.772 --> 00:05:55.416
using still air pressure.

00:05:55.954 --> 00:05:57.312
That was from MIT,

00:05:57.336 --> 00:06:00.141
and of course, we have a robotic octopus.

00:06:00.165 --> 00:06:02.244
This was actually one
of the first projects

00:06:02.268 --> 00:06:04.394
developed in this new field
of soft robots.

00:06:04.418 --> 00:06:06.304
Here, you see the artificial tentacle,

00:06:06.328 --> 00:06:11.007
but they actually built an entire machine
with several tentacles

00:06:11.031 --> 00:06:13.642
they could just throw in the water,

00:06:13.666 --> 00:06:17.959
and you see that it can kind of go around
and do submarine exploration

00:06:17.983 --> 00:06:21.286
in a different way
than rigid robots would do.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.970
But this is very important for delicate
environments, such as coral reefs.

00:06:24.994 --> 00:06:26.390
Let's go back to the ground.

00:06:26.414 --> 00:06:27.604
Here, you see the view

00:06:27.628 --> 00:06:31.776
from a growing robot developed
by my colleagues in Stanford.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.650
You see the camera fixed on top.

00:06:33.674 --> 00:06:35.112
And this robot is particular,

00:06:35.136 --> 00:06:37.552
because using air pressure,
it grows from the tip,

00:06:37.576 --> 00:06:40.922
while the rest of the body stays
in firm contact with the environment.

00:06:41.316 --> 00:06:44.034
And this is inspired
by plants, not animals,

00:06:44.058 --> 00:06:47.373
which grows via the material
in a similar manner

00:06:47.397 --> 00:06:50.357
so it can face a pretty large
variety of situations.

00:06:51.043 --> 00:06:52.711
But I'm a biomedical engineer,

00:06:52.735 --> 00:06:55.004
and perhaps the application
I like the most

00:06:55.028 --> 00:06:56.481
is in the medical field,

00:06:56.505 --> 00:07:01.346
and it's very difficult to imagine
a closer interaction with the human body

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.289
than actually going inside the body,

00:07:03.313 --> 00:07:06.084
for example, to perform
a minimally invasive procedure.

00:07:06.958 --> 00:07:10.360
And here, robots can be
very helpful with the surgeon,

00:07:10.384 --> 00:07:12.133
because they must enter the body

00:07:12.157 --> 00:07:14.784
using small holes
and straight instruments,

00:07:14.808 --> 00:07:18.318
and these instruments must interact
with very delicate structures

00:07:18.342 --> 00:07:20.390
in a very uncertain environment,

00:07:20.414 --> 00:07:22.089
and this must be done safely.

00:07:22.113 --> 00:07:24.225
Also bringing the camera inside the body,

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:27.867
so bringing the eyes of the surgeon
inside the surgical field

00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:30.242
can be very challenging
if you use a rigid stick,

00:07:30.266 --> 00:07:31.873
like a classic endoscope.

00:07:32.517 --> 00:07:35.106
With my previous research group in Europe,

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.726
we developed this
soft camera robot for surgery,

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.518
which is very different
from a classic endoscope,

00:07:41.542 --> 00:07:44.646
which can move thanks
to the flexibility of the module

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:49.558
that can bend in every direction
and also elongate.

00:07:49.582 --> 00:07:52.692
And this was actually used by surgeons
to see what they were doing

00:07:52.716 --> 00:07:55.454
with other instruments
from different points of view,

00:07:55.478 --> 00:07:58.684
without caring that much
about what was touched around.

00:07:59.247 --> 00:08:02.990
And here you see the soft robot in action,

00:08:03.014 --> 00:08:05.832
and it just goes inside.

00:08:05.856 --> 00:08:09.125
This is a body simulator,
not a real human body.

00:08:09.149 --> 00:08:10.300
It goes around.

00:08:10.324 --> 00:08:11.998
You have a light, because usually,

00:08:12.022 --> 00:08:15.143
you don't have too many lights
inside your body.

00:08:15.167 --> 00:08:16.340
We hope.

00:08:16.364 --> 00:08:19.366
(Laughter)

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:24.088
But sometimes, a surgical procedure
can even be done using a single needle,

00:08:24.112 --> 00:08:28.159
and in Stanford now, we are working
on a very flexible needle,

00:08:28.183 --> 00:08:30.835
kind of a very tiny soft robot

00:08:30.859 --> 00:08:34.153
which is mechanically designed
to use the interaction with the tissues

00:08:34.177 --> 00:08:36.407
and steer around inside a solid organ.

00:08:36.431 --> 00:08:40.511
This makes it possible to reach
many different targets, such as tumors,

00:08:40.535 --> 00:08:42.233
deep inside a solid organ

00:08:42.257 --> 00:08:44.582
by using one single insertion point.

00:08:44.606 --> 00:08:48.645
And you can even steer around
the structure that you want to avoid

00:08:48.669 --> 00:08:50.033
on the way to the target.

00:08:51.377 --> 00:08:54.682
So clearly, this is a pretty
exciting time for robotics.

00:08:54.706 --> 00:08:57.859
We have robots that have to deal
with soft structures,

00:08:57.883 --> 00:09:00.468
so this poses new
and very challenging questions

00:09:00.492 --> 00:09:01.849
for the robotics community,

00:09:01.873 --> 00:09:04.548
and indeed, we are just starting
to learn how to control,

00:09:04.572 --> 00:09:07.576
how to put sensors
on these very flexible structures.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.560
But of course, we are not even close
to what nature figured out

00:09:10.584 --> 00:09:12.778
in millions of years of evolution.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:14.906
But one thing I know for sure:

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.446
robots will be softer and safer,

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.452
and they will be out there helping people.

00:09:20.809 --> 00:09:21.960
Thank you.

00:09:21.984 --> 00:09:26.396
(Applause)
