00:00:12.968 --> 00:00:16.968
I'm thrilled to be talking to you
by this high-tech method.

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:20.079
Of all humans who have ever lived,

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:24.712
the overwhelming majority
would have found what we are doing here

00:00:24.736 --> 00:00:27.196
incomprehensible, unbelievable.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.753
Because, for thousands of centuries,

00:00:30.777 --> 00:00:33.712
in the dark time
before the scientific revolution

00:00:33.736 --> 00:00:35.544
and the Enlightenment,

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.536
people had low expectations.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.576
For their lives,
for their descendants' lives.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.442
Typically, they expected

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:47.913
nothing significantly new
or better to be achieved, ever.

00:00:48.847 --> 00:00:53.831
This pessimism
famously appears in the Bible,

00:00:53.855 --> 00:00:58.069
in one of the few biblical passages
with a named author.

00:00:58.093 --> 00:01:01.724
He's called Qohelet,
he's an enigmatic chap.

00:01:02.173 --> 00:01:06.458
He wrote, "What has been is what will be,

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:10.200
and what has been done
is what will be done;

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:13.434
there is nothing new under the sun.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.355
Is there something of which it is said,
'Look, this is new.'

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:22.434
No, that thing was already done
in the ages that came before us."

00:01:23.427 --> 00:01:28.299
Qohelet was describing a world
without novelty.

00:01:29.252 --> 00:01:32.530
By novelty I mean something new
in Qohelet's sense,

00:01:32.554 --> 00:01:35.172
not merely something that's changed,

00:01:35.196 --> 00:01:38.696
but a significant change
with lasting effects,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.895
where people really would say,

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:42.895
"Look, this is new,"

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:45.093
and, preferably, "good."

00:01:46.061 --> 00:01:50.918
So, purely random changes aren't novelty.

00:01:50.942 --> 00:01:56.149
OK, Heraclitus did say
a man can't step in the same river twice,

00:01:56.173 --> 00:01:58.990
because it's not the same river,
he's not the same man.

00:01:59.307 --> 00:02:03.399
But if the river is changing randomly,

00:02:03.423 --> 00:02:05.819
it really is the same river.

00:02:06.311 --> 00:02:07.764
In contrast,

00:02:07.788 --> 00:02:12.399
if an idea in a mind
spreads to other minds,

00:02:12.423 --> 00:02:15.204
and changes lives for generations,

00:02:15.228 --> 00:02:16.728
that is novelty.

00:02:17.395 --> 00:02:20.323
Human life without novelty

00:02:20.347 --> 00:02:23.974
is life without creativity,
without progress.

00:02:24.498 --> 00:02:27.990
It's a static society, a zero-sum game.

00:02:28.712 --> 00:02:32.038
That was the living hell
in which Qohelet lived.

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:35.537
Like everyone, until a few centuries ago.

00:02:36.228 --> 00:02:40.833
It was hell, because for humans,

00:02:40.857 --> 00:02:44.958
suffering is intimately
related to staticity.

00:02:44.982 --> 00:02:47.831
Because staticity isn't just frustrating.

00:02:48.442 --> 00:02:50.442
All sources of suffering --

00:02:50.466 --> 00:02:54.740
famine, pandemics, incoming asteroids,

00:02:54.764 --> 00:02:58.272
and things like war and slavery,

00:02:58.296 --> 00:03:03.797
hurt people only until we have created
the knowledge to prevent them.

00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:08.934
There's a story in Somerset Maugham's
novel "Of Human Bondage"

00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:10.744
about an ancient sage

00:03:10.768 --> 00:03:15.831
who summarizes the entire
history of mankind as,

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.073
"He was born,

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:20.517
he suffered and he died."

00:03:21.296 --> 00:03:23.010
And it goes on:

00:03:23.034 --> 00:03:27.853
"Life was insignificant
and death without consequence."

00:03:28.268 --> 00:03:33.173
And indeed, the overwhelming majority
of humans who have ever lived

00:03:33.197 --> 00:03:36.977
had lives of suffering and grueling labor,

00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:40.315
before dying young and in agony.

00:03:41.493 --> 00:03:45.704
And yes, in most generations

00:03:45.728 --> 00:03:49.886
nothing had any novel consequence
for subsequent generations.

00:03:50.728 --> 00:03:57.452
Nevertheless, when ancient people
tried to explain their condition,

00:03:58.103 --> 00:04:02.412
they typically did so
in grandiose cosmic terms.

00:04:02.794 --> 00:04:05.601
Which was the right thing to do,
as it turns out.

00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:09.420
Even though their actual
explanations, their myths,

00:04:09.444 --> 00:04:10.982
were largely false.

00:04:11.744 --> 00:04:13.807
Some tried to explain

00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:17.363
the grimness and monotony of their world

00:04:17.387 --> 00:04:22.228
in terms of an endless cosmic war
between good and evil,

00:04:22.252 --> 00:04:25.097
in which humans were the battleground.

00:04:25.637 --> 00:04:29.858
Which neatly explained why their own
experience was full of suffering,

00:04:29.882 --> 00:04:32.017
and why progress never happened.

00:04:32.728 --> 00:04:35.407
But it wasn't true.

00:04:36.212 --> 00:04:38.379
Amazingly enough,

00:04:38.403 --> 00:04:41.125
all their conflict and suffering

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:46.569
were just due to the way
they processed ideas.

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:51.367
Being satisfied with dogma,
and just-so stories,

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:53.835
rather than criticizing them

00:04:53.859 --> 00:05:00.327
and trying to guess better explanations
of the world and of their own condition.

00:05:00.696 --> 00:05:05.339
Twentieth-century physics
did create better explanations,

00:05:05.363 --> 00:05:07.546
but still in terms of a cosmic war.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.863
This time, the combatants
were order and chaos, or entropy.

00:05:12.887 --> 00:05:18.144
That story does allow
for hope for the future.

00:05:18.986 --> 00:05:20.177
But in another way,

00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:22.993
it's even bleaker than the ancient myths,

00:05:23.017 --> 00:05:26.791
because the villain, entropy,

00:05:26.815 --> 00:05:30.418
is preordained to have the final victory,

00:05:30.442 --> 00:05:35.323
when the inexorable laws of thermodynamics
shut down all novelty

00:05:35.347 --> 00:05:38.480
with the so-called
heat death of the universe.

00:05:38.982 --> 00:05:43.125
Currently, there's a story
of a local battle in that war,

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:47.093
between sustainability, which is order,

00:05:47.117 --> 00:05:50.474
and wastefulness, which is chaos --

00:05:50.498 --> 00:05:53.561
that's the contemporary take
on good and evil,

00:05:53.585 --> 00:05:56.895
often with the added twist
that humans are the evil,

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.052
so we shouldn't even try to win.

00:05:59.585 --> 00:06:00.776
And recently,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.848
there have been tales
of another cosmic war,

00:06:02.872 --> 00:06:07.053
between gravity,
which collapses the universe,

00:06:07.077 --> 00:06:10.490
and dark energy, which finally shreds it.

00:06:10.514 --> 00:06:11.720
So this time,

00:06:11.744 --> 00:06:15.156
whichever of those cosmic forces wins,

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.330
we lose.

00:06:17.157 --> 00:06:22.137
All those pessimistic accounts
of the human condition

00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:24.470
contain some truth,

00:06:24.494 --> 00:06:26.422
but as prophecies,

00:06:26.446 --> 00:06:29.517
they're all misleading,
and all for the same reason.

00:06:29.962 --> 00:06:34.267
None of them portrays humans
as what we really are.

00:06:34.688 --> 00:06:37.100
As Jacob Bronowski said,

00:06:37.124 --> 00:06:41.045
"Man is not a figure in the landscape --

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:43.847
he is the shaper of the landscape."

00:06:43.871 --> 00:06:45.022
In other words,

00:06:45.046 --> 00:06:49.498
humans are not playthings
of cosmic forces,

00:06:49.522 --> 00:06:52.661
we are users of cosmic forces.

00:06:53.093 --> 00:06:54.863
I'll say more about that in a moment,

00:06:54.887 --> 00:06:59.434
but first, what sorts
of thing create novelty?

00:07:00.022 --> 00:07:03.172
Well, the beginning
of the universe surely did.

00:07:03.196 --> 00:07:06.268
The big bang, nearly 14 billion years ago,

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:09.680
created space, time and energy,

00:07:09.704 --> 00:07:11.212
everything physical.

00:07:11.609 --> 00:07:13.712
And then, immediately,

00:07:13.736 --> 00:07:17.307
what I call the first era of novelty,

00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:20.135
with the first atom, the first star,

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:21.675
the first black hole,

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:23.373
the first galaxy.

00:07:23.833 --> 00:07:27.000
But then, at some point,

00:07:27.024 --> 00:07:30.283
novelty vanished from the universe.

00:07:30.307 --> 00:07:34.442
Perhaps from as early
as 12 or 13 billion years ago,

00:07:34.466 --> 00:07:36.506
right up to the present day,

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:41.585
there's never been any new kind
of astronomical object.

00:07:41.609 --> 00:07:45.990
There's only been what I call
the great monotony.

00:07:46.807 --> 00:07:51.545
So, Qohelet was accidentally
even more right

00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:54.410
about the universe beyond the Sun

00:07:54.434 --> 00:07:56.736
than he was about under the Sun.

00:07:57.156 --> 00:08:00.827
So long as the great monotony lasts,

00:08:00.851 --> 00:08:03.414
what has been out there

00:08:03.438 --> 00:08:05.406
really is what will be.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:06.982
And there is nothing out there

00:08:07.006 --> 00:08:11.034
of which it can truly be said,
"Look, this is new."

00:08:11.646 --> 00:08:13.637
Nevertheless,

00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:17.828
at some point during the great monotony,

00:08:17.852 --> 00:08:21.537
there was an event --
inconsequential at the time,

00:08:21.561 --> 00:08:23.760
and even billions of years later,

00:08:23.784 --> 00:08:27.172
it had affected nothing
beyond its home planet --

00:08:27.196 --> 00:08:32.951
yet eventually, it could cause
cosmically momentous novelty.

00:08:33.277 --> 00:08:36.586
That event was the origin of life:

00:08:37.102 --> 00:08:40.204
creating the first genetic knowledge,

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:43.085
coding for biological adaptations,

00:08:43.109 --> 00:08:45.109
coding for novelty.

00:08:46.243 --> 00:08:50.067
On Earth, it utterly
transformed the surface.

00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:53.495
Genes in the DNA
of single-celled organisms

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:55.417
put oxygen in the air,

00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:57.299
extracted CO2,

00:08:57.323 --> 00:09:00.299
put chalk and iron ore into the ground,

00:09:00.323 --> 00:09:06.347
hardly a cubic inch of the surface
to some depth has remained unaffected

00:09:06.371 --> 00:09:08.299
by those genes.

00:09:08.942 --> 00:09:14.347
The Earth became,
if not a novel place on the cosmic scale,

00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:15.838
certainly a weird one.

00:09:16.236 --> 00:09:19.458
Just as an example, beyond Earth,

00:09:19.482 --> 00:09:23.990
only a few hundred different
chemical substances have been detected.

00:09:24.411 --> 00:09:27.866
Presumably, there are some more
in lifeless locations,

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:29.739
but on Earth,

00:09:29.763 --> 00:09:33.294
evolution created billions
of different chemicals.

00:09:33.843 --> 00:09:36.905
And then the first plants, animals,

00:09:36.929 --> 00:09:41.738
and then, in some ancestor
species of ours,

00:09:41.762 --> 00:09:43.595
explanatory knowledge.

00:09:43.936 --> 00:09:46.944
For the first time in the universe,
for all we know.

00:09:47.413 --> 00:09:52.601
Explanatory knowledge
is the defining adaptation of our species.

00:09:53.149 --> 00:09:56.244
It differs from
the nonexplanatory knowledge

00:09:56.268 --> 00:09:58.506
in DNA, for instance,

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.306
by being universal.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:04.354
That is to say,
whatever can be understood,

00:10:04.378 --> 00:10:07.044
can be understood
through explanatory knowledge.

00:10:07.068 --> 00:10:10.871
And more, any physical process

00:10:10.895 --> 00:10:13.776
can be controlled by such knowledge,

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:16.688
limited only by the laws of physics.

00:10:17.228 --> 00:10:20.999
And so, explanatory knowledge, too,

00:10:21.023 --> 00:10:23.956
has begun to transform
the Earth's surface.

00:10:24.792 --> 00:10:30.117
And soon, the Earth will become
the only known object in the universe

00:10:30.141 --> 00:10:35.556
that turns aside incoming asteroids
instead of attracting them.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.713
Qohelet was understandably misled

00:10:39.737 --> 00:10:43.632
by the painful slowness
of progress in his day.

00:10:44.109 --> 00:10:48.395
Novelty in human life
was still too rare, too gradual,

00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:51.125
to be noticed in one generation.

00:10:51.149 --> 00:10:53.093
And in the biosphere,

00:10:53.117 --> 00:10:56.825
the evolution of novel species
was even slower.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.688
But both things were happening.

00:11:00.029 --> 00:11:06.458
Now, why is there a great monotony
in the universe at large,

00:11:06.482 --> 00:11:10.219
and what makes our planet buck that trend?

00:11:10.902 --> 00:11:15.905
Well, the universe at large
is relatively simple.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.403
Stars are so simple

00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:21.823
that we can predict their behavior
billions of years into the future,

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:25.402
and retrodict how they formed
billions of years ago.

00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:28.370
So why is the universe simple?

00:11:28.759 --> 00:11:34.535
Basically, it's because big,
massive, powerful things

00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:38.723
strongly affect lesser things,
and not vice versa.

00:11:39.617 --> 00:11:41.982
I call that the hierarchy rule.

00:11:42.006 --> 00:11:45.236
For example, when a comet hits the Sun,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.728
the Sun carries on just as before,

00:11:47.752 --> 00:11:49.950
but the comet is vaporized.

00:11:50.657 --> 00:11:52.514
For the same reason,

00:11:52.538 --> 00:11:59.109
big things are not much affected
by small parts of themselves,

00:11:59.133 --> 00:12:00.910
i.e., by details.

00:12:01.609 --> 00:12:04.672
Which means that their overall behavior

00:12:04.696 --> 00:12:05.846
is simple.

00:12:06.165 --> 00:12:09.561
And since nothing very new
can happen to things

00:12:09.585 --> 00:12:11.323
that remain simple,

00:12:11.347 --> 00:12:16.652
the hierarchy rule,
by causing large-scale simplicity,

00:12:16.676 --> 00:12:19.347
has caused the great monotony.

00:12:20.473 --> 00:12:23.910
But, the saving grace is

00:12:23.934 --> 00:12:27.316
the hierarchy rule is not a law of nature.

00:12:27.918 --> 00:12:30.831
It just happens to have held
so far in the universe,

00:12:30.855 --> 00:12:32.117
except here.

00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:37.093
In our biosphere,
molecule-sized objects, genes,

00:12:37.117 --> 00:12:40.172
control vastly disproportionate resources.

00:12:40.615 --> 00:12:43.511
The first genes for photosynthesis,

00:12:43.535 --> 00:12:46.282
by causing their own proliferation,

00:12:46.306 --> 00:12:49.821
and then transforming
the surface of the planet,

00:12:49.845 --> 00:12:54.303
have violated or reversed
the hierarchy rule

00:12:54.327 --> 00:12:58.414
by the mind-blowing factor
of 10 to the power 40.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:03.672
Explanatory knowledge
is potentially far more powerful

00:13:03.696 --> 00:13:05.331
because of universality,

00:13:05.355 --> 00:13:07.712
and more rapidly created.

00:13:08.157 --> 00:13:12.881
When human knowledge
has achieved a factor 10 to the 40,

00:13:12.905 --> 00:13:15.865
it will pretty much control
the entire galaxy,

00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:17.817
and will be looking beyond.

00:13:17.841 --> 00:13:20.268
So humans,

00:13:20.292 --> 00:13:24.958
and any other explanation creators
who may exist out there,

00:13:24.982 --> 00:13:29.894
are the ultimate agents
of novelty for the universe.

00:13:30.343 --> 00:13:33.002
We are the reason and the means

00:13:33.026 --> 00:13:39.006
by which novelty and creativity,
knowledge, progress,

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:44.535
can have objective,
large-scale physical effects.

00:13:45.514 --> 00:13:48.363
From the human perspective,

00:13:48.387 --> 00:13:52.593
the only alternative
to that living hell of static societies

00:13:52.617 --> 00:13:57.204
is continual creation of new ideas,

00:13:57.228 --> 00:14:00.309
behaviors, new kinds of objects.

00:14:00.728 --> 00:14:02.862
This robot will soon be obsolete,

00:14:02.886 --> 00:14:06.900
because of new explanatory
knowledge, progress.

00:14:08.204 --> 00:14:11.410
But from the cosmic perspective,

00:14:11.434 --> 00:14:16.188
explanatory knowledge
is the nemesis of the hierarchy rule.

00:14:16.752 --> 00:14:19.486
It's the destroyer of the great monotony.

00:14:20.379 --> 00:14:25.545
So it's the creator
of the next cosmological era,

00:14:25.569 --> 00:14:27.085
the Anthropocene.

00:14:27.966 --> 00:14:31.339
If one can speak of a cosmic war,

00:14:31.363 --> 00:14:34.768
it's not the one portrayed
in those pessimistic stories.

00:14:34.792 --> 00:14:39.506
It's a war between monotony and novelty,

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.962
between stasis and creativity.

00:14:43.633 --> 00:14:45.664
And in this war,

00:14:45.688 --> 00:14:50.016
our side is not destined to lose.

00:14:50.593 --> 00:14:57.395
If we choose to apply our unique
capacity to create explanatory knowledge,

00:14:57.419 --> 00:14:59.394
we could win.

00:15:00.175 --> 00:15:01.325
Thanks.

00:15:02.095 --> 00:15:08.595
(Applause)
