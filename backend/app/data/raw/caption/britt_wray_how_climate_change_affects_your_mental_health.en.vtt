00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:16.532
For all that's ever been said
about climate change,

00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:20.436
we haven't heard nearly enough
about the psychological impacts

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.584
of living in a warming world.

00:00:22.608 --> 00:00:24.569
If you've heard the grim climate research

00:00:24.593 --> 00:00:28.077
that science communicators like me
weave into our books and documentaries,

00:00:28.101 --> 00:00:32.092
you've probably felt bouts of fear,
fatalism or hopelessness.

00:00:32.617 --> 00:00:34.672
If you've been impacted
by climate disaster,

00:00:34.696 --> 00:00:36.974
these feelings can set in much deeper,

00:00:36.998 --> 00:00:39.394
leading to shock, trauma,

00:00:39.418 --> 00:00:41.299
strained relationships, substance abuse

00:00:41.323 --> 00:00:43.816
and the loss of personal
identity and control.

00:00:44.314 --> 00:00:48.546
Vital political and technological work
is underway to moderate our climate chaos,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.214
but I'm here to evoke a feeling in you

00:00:51.238 --> 00:00:54.357
for why we also need
our actions and policies

00:00:54.381 --> 00:00:57.263
to reflect an understanding
of how our changing environments

00:00:57.287 --> 00:01:00.374
threaten our mental,
social and spiritual well-being.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.613
The anxiety, grief and depression
of climate scientists and activists

00:01:04.637 --> 00:01:06.653
have been reported on for years.

00:01:06.677 --> 00:01:08.827
Trends we've seen
after extreme weather events

00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:10.581
like hurricane Sandy or Katrina

00:01:10.605 --> 00:01:13.434
for increased PTSD and suicidality.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.776
And there are rich mental-health data
from northern communities

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.244
where warming is the fastest,

00:01:18.268 --> 00:01:20.331
like the Inuit in Labrador,

00:01:20.355 --> 00:01:23.228
who face existential distress
as they witness the ice,

00:01:23.252 --> 00:01:24.839
a big part of their identity,

00:01:24.863 --> 00:01:26.730
vanishing before their eyes.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.585
Now if that weren't enough,

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.459
the American Psychological Association

00:01:30.483 --> 00:01:33.355
says that our psychological
responses to climate change,

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:37.609
like conflict avoidance, helplessness
and resignation, are growing.

00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:41.022
This means that our conscious
and unconscious mental processes

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:42.212
are holding us back

00:01:42.236 --> 00:01:45.117
from identifying the causes
of the problem for what they are,

00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:48.339
working on solutions and fostering
our own psychological resilience,

00:01:48.363 --> 00:01:51.902
but we need all those things
to take on what we've created.

00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:54.944
Lately, I've been studying a phenomenon

00:01:54.968 --> 00:01:57.483
that's just one example
of the emotional hardships

00:01:57.507 --> 00:01:58.696
that we're seeing.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.632
And it comes in the form of a question

00:02:00.656 --> 00:02:04.363
that a significant amount of people
in my generation are struggling to answer.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.073
That being:

00:02:06.097 --> 00:02:09.105
Should I have a child
in the age of climate change?

00:02:09.613 --> 00:02:11.136
After all, any child born today

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.430
will have to live in a world
where hurricanes, flooding, wildfires --

00:02:14.454 --> 00:02:16.424
what we used to call natural disasters --

00:02:16.448 --> 00:02:17.852
have become commonplace.

00:02:18.688 --> 00:02:22.442
The hottest 20 years on record
occurred within the last 22.

00:02:23.172 --> 00:02:25.974
The UN expects that two-thirds
of the global population

00:02:25.998 --> 00:02:28.971
may face water shortages
only six years from now.

00:02:29.844 --> 00:02:31.677
The World Bank predicts that by 2050,

00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:34.629
there's going to be
140 million climate refugees

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:37.593
in sub-Saharan Africa,
Latin America and South Asia.

00:02:37.617 --> 00:02:40.585
And other estimates put that number
at over one billion.

00:02:41.284 --> 00:02:43.474
Mass migrations and resource scarcity

00:02:43.498 --> 00:02:47.479
increase the risk for violence,
war and political instability.

00:02:48.146 --> 00:02:52.788
The UN just reported that we are pushing
up to a million species to extinction,

00:02:52.812 --> 00:02:53.987
many within decades,

00:02:54.011 --> 00:02:58.635
and our emissions are still increasing,
even after the Paris Agreement.

00:02:59.373 --> 00:03:00.841
Over the last year and a half,

00:03:00.865 --> 00:03:02.976
I've been conducting
workshops and interviews

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.198
with hundreds of people

00:03:04.222 --> 00:03:06.556
about parenting in the climate crisis.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.736
And I can tell you

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.117
that people who are worried about
having kids because of climate change

00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:13.093
are not motivated by an ascetic pride.

00:03:13.117 --> 00:03:14.649
They're nerve-racked.

00:03:14.673 --> 00:03:16.735
There's even a movement
called BirthStrike,

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.491
whose members have declared
they're not going to have kids

00:03:19.515 --> 00:03:21.704
because of the state
of the ecological crisis

00:03:21.728 --> 00:03:24.855
and inaction from governments
to address this existential threat.

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.346
And yes, other generations have also
faced their own apocalyptic dangers,

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.068
but that is no reason to disregard
the very real threat to our survival now.

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.299
Some feel that it's better
to adopt children.

00:03:35.323 --> 00:03:37.434
Or that it's unethical
to have more than one,

00:03:37.458 --> 00:03:39.196
especially three, four or more,

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.601
because kids increase
greenhouse gas emissions.

00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:45.813
Now, it is a really unfortunate
state of affairs

00:03:45.837 --> 00:03:48.228
when people who want kids
sacrifice their right to

00:03:48.252 --> 00:03:52.325
because, somehow, they have been told
that their lifestyle choices are to blame

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.095
when the fault is far more systemic,

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:56.269
but let's just unpack the logic here.

00:03:57.048 --> 00:03:59.361
So an oft-cited study
shows that, on average,

00:03:59.385 --> 00:04:02.085
having one less child
in an industrialized nation

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.990
can save about 59 tons
of carbon dioxide per year.

00:04:06.617 --> 00:04:08.037
While in comparison,

00:04:08.061 --> 00:04:11.004
living car-free saves nearly 2.5 tons,

00:04:11.028 --> 00:04:14.084
avoiding a transatlantic flight --
and this is just one --

00:04:14.108 --> 00:04:16.068
saves about 1.5 tons,

00:04:16.092 --> 00:04:19.743
and eating a plant-based diet
can save almost one ton per year.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.156
And consider that a Bangladeshi child

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.024
only adds 56 metric tons of carbon
to their parents' carbon legacy

00:04:27.048 --> 00:04:28.500
over their lifetime,

00:04:28.524 --> 00:04:33.944
while an American child, in comparison,
adds 9,441 to theirs.

00:04:34.428 --> 00:04:35.960
So this is why some people argue

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:38.706
that it's parents from nations
with huge carbon footprints

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.583
who should think the hardest
about how many kids they have.

00:04:41.901 --> 00:04:45.250
But the decision to have a child
and one's feelings about the future

00:04:45.274 --> 00:04:46.710
are deeply personal,

00:04:46.734 --> 00:04:48.956
and wrapped up
in all sorts of cultural norms,

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.830
religious beliefs, socioeconomic status,
education levels and more.

00:04:53.184 --> 00:04:56.001
And so to some, this debate
about kids in the climate crisis

00:04:56.025 --> 00:04:58.556
can seem like it came from another planet.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.763
Many have more immediate threats
to their survival to think about,

00:05:01.787 --> 00:05:04.084
like, how they're going to put
food on the table,

00:05:04.108 --> 00:05:06.205
when they're a single mom
working three jobs,

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.220
or they're HIV positive
or on the move in a migrant caravan.

00:05:09.244 --> 00:05:12.990
Tragically, though, climate change
is really great at intersectionality.

00:05:13.387 --> 00:05:17.201
It multiplies the stresses
marginalized communities already face.

00:05:18.442 --> 00:05:21.379
A political scientist once said to me
that a leading indicator

00:05:21.403 --> 00:05:24.513
that climate change is starting
to hit home, psychologically,

00:05:24.537 --> 00:05:26.912
would be an increase
in the rate of informed women

00:05:26.936 --> 00:05:28.607
deciding to not have children.

00:05:29.522 --> 00:05:30.672
Interesting.

00:05:31.236 --> 00:05:33.890
Is it hitting home with you,
psychologically?

00:05:34.521 --> 00:05:38.062
Are you perhaps someone
with climate-linked pre-traumatic stress?

00:05:38.737 --> 00:05:40.689
A climate psychiatrist coined that term,

00:05:40.713 --> 00:05:44.102
and that's a profession now, by the way,
shrinks for climate woes.

00:05:44.126 --> 00:05:46.704
They're getting work at a time
when some high schoolers

00:05:46.728 --> 00:05:48.831
don't want to apply
to university any longer,

00:05:48.855 --> 00:05:51.418
because they can't foresee
a future for themselves.

00:05:51.831 --> 00:05:54.262
And this brings me back to my main point.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.761
The growing concern about having kids
in the climate crisis

00:05:57.785 --> 00:06:01.780
is an urgent indicator
of how hard-pressed people are feeling.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.791
Right now, students around the world
are screaming for change

00:06:06.815 --> 00:06:08.771
in the piercing voice of despair.

00:06:09.645 --> 00:06:12.558
And the fact that we can see
how we contribute to this problem

00:06:12.582 --> 00:06:14.050
that makes us feel unsafe

00:06:14.074 --> 00:06:15.907
is crazy-making in itself.

00:06:16.947 --> 00:06:18.879
Climate change is all-encompassing

00:06:18.903 --> 00:06:21.665
and so are the ways
that it messes with our minds.

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:24.014
Many activists will tell you

00:06:24.038 --> 00:06:26.403
that the best antidote
to grief is activism.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.297
And some psychologists will tell you
the answer can be found in therapy.

00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:33.226
Others believe the key is to imagine
you're on your deathbed,

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.940
reflecting back on what's mattered
the most in your life,

00:06:35.964 --> 00:06:38.363
so you can identify
what you should do more of now,

00:06:38.387 --> 00:06:39.982
with the time that you have left.

00:06:40.006 --> 00:06:41.863
We need all these ideas, and more,

00:06:41.887 --> 00:06:43.633
to take care of our innermost selves

00:06:43.657 --> 00:06:47.783
as the environments we've known
become more punishing towards us.

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:49.950
And whether you have children or not,

00:06:49.974 --> 00:06:52.720
we need to be honest
about what is happening,

00:06:52.744 --> 00:06:54.611
and what we owe one another.

00:06:55.601 --> 00:06:56.847
We cannot afford to treat

00:06:56.871 --> 00:06:58.947
the psychological impacts
of climate change

00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:00.132
as some afterthought,

00:07:00.156 --> 00:07:04.442
because the other issues, of science,
technology and the politics and economy,

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:07.799
feel hard, while this somehow feels soft.

00:07:08.807 --> 00:07:11.181
Mental health needs to be an integral part

00:07:11.205 --> 00:07:13.506
of any climate change survival strategy,

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.850
requiring funding,
and ethics of equity and care,

00:07:16.874 --> 00:07:18.541
and widespread awareness.

00:07:18.886 --> 00:07:22.442
Because even if you're the most
emotionally avoidant person on the planet,

00:07:22.466 --> 00:07:25.707
there's no rug in the world
that's big enough to sweep this up under.

00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:26.896
Thank you.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.238
(Applause)
