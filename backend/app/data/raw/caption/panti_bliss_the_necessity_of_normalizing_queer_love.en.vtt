00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.542
Hi! Hi!

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.778
I am forty-five years old.

00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:21.740
I know I look amazing, thank you.
(Laughter)

00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:23.739
I am forty-five years old

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:29.037
and I have never once

00:00:29.051 --> 00:00:33.930
unselfconsciously held hands
with a lover in public.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.538
I am forty-five years old
and I have never once

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:46.268
casually, comfortably, carelessly
held hands with a partner in public.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.079
I don't know how many of you
can even imagine what that might be like

00:00:53.448 --> 00:00:56.163
because, of course,
it's a small thing, isn't it,

00:00:56.163 --> 00:00:58.959
holding hands with a lover in public?

00:00:59.214 --> 00:01:02.844
And it's not that nobody wanted to,
it's just that we didn't feel comfortable.

00:01:03.474 --> 00:01:08.414
Now, like many gay people,
when I was younger, in my young life,

00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:12.066
I struggled at one time against being gay.

00:01:12.087 --> 00:01:14.695
I didn't want to be different.

00:01:14.742 --> 00:01:18.220
I didn't want to be this thing
that I didn't really understand.

00:01:18.473 --> 00:01:24.306
This thing that I had learned
was shameful or jokeworthy.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.440
But when I eventually did
sort of understand

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.908
and come to accept who and what I am,

00:01:32.928 --> 00:01:35.231
I have never since that moment,

00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:39.511
never once, have I ever wished
that it turned out differently!

00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:46.226
I am thoroughly, deeply, delightedly,
happy to be gay!

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.479
(Applause)

00:01:55.414 --> 00:02:00.367
It suits me! (Laughter)
I am really good at it! (Laughter)

00:02:00.773 --> 00:02:06.452
And yet, everyday
I am jealous of straight people,

00:02:06.453 --> 00:02:12.963
because that private, little, small,
intimate gesture of affection

00:02:12.972 --> 00:02:15.130
has never once been mine.

00:02:16.484 --> 00:02:19.891
Everyday I see young, straight couples
walking through the park

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:25.474
and they are casually holding hands
and I am jealous of them!

00:02:26.384 --> 00:02:29.491
I see a teenage couple at a bus stop

00:02:29.517 --> 00:02:32.513
and she is leaning into him,
and her hand is in his,

00:02:32.538 --> 00:02:35.786
and both of their hands are
tucked into his jacket pocket for warmth,

00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:39.851
and I am jealous of that teenage couple!

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.775
I will sometimes see a man
who unconsciously

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.562
put his hand, a protective arm,
around his girlfriend

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:52.866
and she'll link her fingers through his,
and I am jealous of that!

00:02:52.887 --> 00:02:55.552
Maybe you're on Grafton Street
and you see an older lady

00:02:55.552 --> 00:02:58.492
and she gestures to draw
her husband's attention

00:02:58.502 --> 00:03:00.212
to something in the window,

00:03:00.228 --> 00:03:02.638
and without even thinking
he just takes her hand

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:05.077
and they stand there
peering into the window

00:03:05.077 --> 00:03:07.987
discussing whatever it is
that drew their attention

00:03:08.215 --> 00:03:12.588
and their hands are
just carelessly joined together,

00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:16.797
and I am jealous of that!

00:03:16.952 --> 00:03:22.032
Because gay people do not
get to hold hands in public

00:03:22.186 --> 00:03:25.840
without first considering the risk.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.280
Gay people do not get to put an arm
through another arm

00:03:30.545 --> 00:03:33.754
or put a hand on a boyfriend's waist
without first considering

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.979
what the possible
consequences might be.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.710
We look around to see:
where are we, who's around,

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.347
is it late at night?
What kind of area is it?

00:03:43.486 --> 00:03:47.476
Are there bored teenagers
hanging around looking for amusement?

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.044
Are there bunches of lads
standing outside a pub?

00:03:51.507 --> 00:03:54.805
And if we decided OK,
maybe it is, it's OK,

00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:56.390
well then we do hold hands,

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.746
but the thing is that now those hands
are not casual and thoughtless.

00:04:02.154 --> 00:04:05.588
They are now
considered and weighed.

00:04:06.652 --> 00:04:11.199
But we stroll on hand in hand
trying to be just normal and carefree

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.572
just like everybody else,
but actually we're not!

00:04:13.572 --> 00:04:18.629
Because we are constantly scanning
the pavement ahead, just in case.

00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:23.386
And then even if we do see, you know,
a group of blokes coming towards us,

00:04:23.412 --> 00:04:29.010
maybe we will decide sort of silently
to continue holding hands, defiantly!

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.187
But now our small, intimate gesture
between two people in love

00:04:35.234 --> 00:04:39.166
is no longer a small, intimate gesture.

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.561
It is a political act of defiance,
and it has been ruined.

00:04:45.058 --> 00:04:46.877
And anyway then you sort of think:

00:04:46.877 --> 00:04:51.220
"Well, we've had such a lovely afternoon
poking around in that garden center

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.596
looking at things for the garden
we don't actually have."

00:04:54.596 --> 00:04:55.876
(Laughter)

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.328
And then you think, all it will take
is one spat "faggots" or a split lip

00:05:01.343 --> 00:05:06.867
to turn that really lovely afternoon
into a bad afternoon

00:05:06.905 --> 00:05:10.562
that you will never want to remember.

00:05:10.797 --> 00:05:13.557
And even if you are somewhere
where you think:

00:05:13.572 --> 00:05:15.498
"Ah, it's perfectly fine here.

00:05:15.506 --> 00:05:19.131
Nobody here is going to react badly
to our tiny gesture."

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:22.799
You know, I don't know, say you're
wandering through a posh department store.

00:05:23.265 --> 00:05:26.795
Even then people will notice.

00:05:27.165 --> 00:05:29.566
Now, they may only notice
because they're thinking:

00:05:29.566 --> 00:05:32.679
"Isn't nice to see two gays
holding hands in public?"

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:35.383
But they still notice,

00:05:35.414 --> 00:05:39.187
and I don't want them to notice

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:44.124
because then our small, intimate,
private, little, human gesture

00:05:44.474 --> 00:05:48.854
has been turned into a statement,
and I don't want that!

00:05:49.971 --> 00:05:53.761
Our little, private, gesture,
like SchrÃ¶dinger's cat,

00:05:53.769 --> 00:05:57.599
is altered simply by being observed.

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:00.887
We live in this sort of homophobic world,

00:06:00.898 --> 00:06:02.551
and you might think

00:06:02.567 --> 00:06:05.585
that a small, little thing
like holding hands in public,

00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:07.972
"Well, it's just a small thing,"
and you're right!

00:06:07.983 --> 00:06:10.916
It is indeed just a small thing.

00:06:10.916 --> 00:06:14.956
But it is one of many small things
that make us human,

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:17.752
and there are lots of small things

00:06:17.782 --> 00:06:22.416
everyday that LGBT people
have to put up with,

00:06:23.056 --> 00:06:26.021
that other people
don't have to put up with.

00:06:26.224 --> 00:06:28.511
Lots of small things
that we have to put up with

00:06:28.511 --> 00:06:33.961
in order to be safe or not to be
the object of ridicule or scorn.

00:06:34.557 --> 00:06:37.354
And we are expected
to put up with those things

00:06:37.354 --> 00:06:40.194
and just thank our blessings
that we don't live in a country

00:06:40.194 --> 00:06:43.974
where we could be imprisoned
or executed for being gay.

00:06:44.202 --> 00:06:49.452
And we are so used to making
those small adjustments everyday,

00:06:49.682 --> 00:06:53.786
that even now we rarely ourselves
even notice that we are doing it,

00:06:53.786 --> 00:06:57.160
because it is just part
of the background of our lives.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.330
This constant malign presence
that we have assimilated,

00:07:01.356 --> 00:07:05.286
and if we complain about it, we are told
we have nothing to complain about

00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:09.291
because: "Aren't you lucky
that you don't live in Uganda?"

00:07:09.698 --> 00:07:14.558
And yes, I am lucky
that I don't live in Uganda,

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.270
but that's not good enough!

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:19.550
This isn't some sort of game
or competition

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.013
where the person who has it the worst
wins the right to complain

00:07:23.013 --> 00:07:26.013
and everybody else has to just
put up or shut up.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.540
Our society is homophobic!

00:07:30.203 --> 00:07:33.581
It is infused with homophobia.

00:07:33.588 --> 00:07:36.758
It is dripping with homophobia.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:42.560
And when you are forty-five years old and
you have spent thirty years putting up,

00:07:42.725 --> 00:07:45.995
thirty years absorbing
all of those small slights

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.160
and intimidations and sneers
and occasionally much worse,

00:07:50.426 --> 00:07:53.857
you just get tired of it.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.250
You get fed up putting up.

00:07:57.386 --> 00:08:01.476
I am fed up of reading yet another article
by yet another straight person

00:08:01.476 --> 00:08:05.296
explaining why I am less somehow
than everybody else.

00:08:05.704 --> 00:08:11.102
You get fed up listening to people
describe you as intrinsically disordered,

00:08:11.102 --> 00:08:14.568
people who don't even know you,
from their celibate pulpits.

00:08:14.568 --> 00:08:17.510
You get fed up of the scrawled graffiti,

00:08:17.626 --> 00:08:21.685
and you get fed up of people
sneeringly describe things as gay.

00:08:21.685 --> 00:08:25.990
You get fed up of steeling yourself
to pass by the Saturday night drunks

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.580
hoping that they won't notice you,

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:33.543
and you get fed up of people
using their time and energies and talents

00:08:33.543 --> 00:08:40.327
to campaign against you being treated
just like every other citizen.

00:08:40.528 --> 00:08:42.528
(Applause)

00:08:49.723 --> 00:08:52.667
I'm forty-five
and I'm fed up putting up.

00:08:53.021 --> 00:08:59.001
Now I would, of course, prefer if nobody
harbored any animosity towards gay people

00:08:59.001 --> 00:09:02.181
or any discomfort with gay relationships,

00:09:02.247 --> 00:09:08.547
but, you know, I can live with the kind of
small, personal, private homophobia

00:09:09.189 --> 00:09:10.808
that some people might have.

00:09:10.808 --> 00:09:15.227
For example,
I can live with Mary in Wicklow

00:09:15.227 --> 00:09:19.022
who sometimes turns on the television
and sees Graham Norton and thinks,

00:09:19.022 --> 00:09:23.201
"Oh, he seems nice enough
but does he have to be so gay?"

00:09:23.201 --> 00:09:24.649
(Laughter)

00:09:24.649 --> 00:09:25.809
I can live with that.

00:09:25.809 --> 00:09:30.152
I can live with Mary who doesn't
know any gay people,

00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:34.193
apart from that fella who does her hair
once a month in "Curl Up and Dye".

00:09:34.193 --> 00:09:35.229
(Laughter)

00:09:35.229 --> 00:09:38.799
Mary, whose only knowledge of gay people
and our relationships

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.860
comes from what she has gleaned from
schoolyards, church and Coronation Street.

00:09:44.691 --> 00:09:46.201
I can live with that.

00:09:46.232 --> 00:09:52.498
I would be happy to sit down on the sofa
and watch Coronation Street with Mary.

00:09:52.498 --> 00:09:56.778
I would be happy to have a cup of tea
with her and discuss with her

00:09:56.786 --> 00:10:00.307
why she feels a little uncomfortable
with gay relationships

00:10:00.307 --> 00:10:04.176
and I would hope that
Mary would change her mind.

00:10:04.176 --> 00:10:06.476
I would hope that she would
meet more gay people

00:10:06.486 --> 00:10:10.382
and find out pretty quickly that
we are just as ordinary, just as nice

00:10:10.382 --> 00:10:13.532
or just as annoying
as all of you people are.

00:10:13.684 --> 00:10:16.834
And I would hope that
she would change her mind

00:10:16.834 --> 00:10:19.071
for her own sake
as much as anybody else's,

00:10:19.076 --> 00:10:21.926
because gay people are just as capable

00:10:21.953 --> 00:10:26.193
of bringing goodness into Mary's life
as anybody else.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.929
And, of course, we could
help her with the decorating!

00:10:28.971 --> 00:10:30.971
(Laughter)

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:40.690
But that kind of personal discomfort
with gay people and their relationships

00:10:40.793 --> 00:10:43.333
is entirely different

00:10:43.457 --> 00:10:47.457
from the kind of homophobia
that manifests itself in public.

00:10:47.489 --> 00:10:48.754
The kind of homophobia

00:10:48.754 --> 00:10:54.610
that manifests itself in an attempt
to have LGBT people treated differently

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:57.110
or less than everybody else.

00:10:57.399 --> 00:11:00.753
The kind of homophobia that
seeks to characterize gay people

00:11:00.753 --> 00:11:04.983
and their relationships
as less worthy of respect.

00:11:06.081 --> 00:11:09.917
That kind of homophobia
I do have a problem with,

00:11:09.917 --> 00:11:13.112
and I think gay people should be allowed
to call it when they see it,

00:11:13.112 --> 00:11:16.702
because it is our right to do so!

00:11:17.157 --> 00:11:22.777
Of course, many people
object to the word homophobia itself.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.310
They object to the "phobia" part.

00:11:26.459 --> 00:11:29.122
'I'm not afraid of you," they say.

00:11:29.152 --> 00:11:30.185
(Laughter)

00:11:30.185 --> 00:11:31.305
But I'm not saying

00:11:31.314 --> 00:11:35.931
that homophobes cower in fear every time
they pass a Cher album,

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.960
(Laughter)

00:11:38.181 --> 00:11:39.941
but they are afraid.

00:11:40.684 --> 00:11:44.284
They are afraid of what the world
will look like

00:11:44.941 --> 00:11:48.802
when it treats gay, lesbian
and bisexual people with the same respect

00:11:48.802 --> 00:11:50.542
as everybody else.

00:11:50.679 --> 00:11:57.019
They are afraid that they won't fit
in this brave new world of equality.

00:11:57.409 --> 00:12:01.529
But, of course, their fear is irrational

00:12:01.851 --> 00:12:06.071
because, of course, the world
will not look any different.

00:12:06.703 --> 00:12:10.523
Kids will still want to eat ice cream,
dogs will still play fetch,

00:12:10.528 --> 00:12:11.873
the tide will still come in,

00:12:11.873 --> 00:12:14.300
and parallel parking
will still be difficult.

00:12:14.324 --> 00:12:15.835
(Laughter)

00:12:17.208 --> 00:12:22.278
The most vocal homophobes
who know that they long ago

00:12:22.285 --> 00:12:26.795
lost the arguments around
the decriminalization of homosexual sex

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.767
or every other advance
for gay people since.

00:12:29.767 --> 00:12:32.847
These days you will find
those very vocal homophobes

00:12:32.976 --> 00:12:37.316
clustered around
the same-sex marriage debate --

00:12:37.686 --> 00:12:40.131
and it is quite the spectacle

00:12:40.131 --> 00:12:41.477
because, of course, they know

00:12:41.477 --> 00:12:45.297
that they can't just come right out
and bluntly say what drives them,

00:12:45.298 --> 00:12:47.915
which is an animus towards gay people,

00:12:47.923 --> 00:12:51.289
and a disgust at what
they imagine we do in bed,

00:12:51.599 --> 00:12:55.484
because they know that that won't wash
with the general public anymore.

00:12:55.484 --> 00:13:00.108
So they are forced to sort of scramble
for any other reason

00:13:00.108 --> 00:13:02.997
that they can think of
to argue their case.

00:13:02.997 --> 00:13:07.567
So, gay people are going to destroy
the institution of marriage,

00:13:08.456 --> 00:13:12.326
gay couples will be wandering through
orphanages picking babies off shelves

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:15.741
trying to find one that matches
their new IKEA sofa.

00:13:15.741 --> 00:13:17.060
(Laughter)

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.668
Or that allowing gay people to get
married will destroy society itself,

00:13:21.668 --> 00:13:25.488
and many, many more including
my own personal favorite,

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:30.810
which is the old argument that the word
"marriage" is defined in some dictionary

00:13:31.235 --> 00:13:33.802
as a union between a man and a woman,

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:37.872
and that therefore same-sex marriage
can't possibly be a "marriage".

00:13:37.872 --> 00:13:41.947
Which is a piffling argument against
words and dictionaries

00:13:41.947 --> 00:13:46.471
and not an argument against
same-sex marriage.

00:13:47.106 --> 00:13:49.106
(Applause)

00:13:53.387 --> 00:13:57.827
Now, of course, the other real driver
of homophobia,

00:13:58.204 --> 00:14:01.842
and you can all clutch your pearls here
because I am going to go here,

00:14:01.842 --> 00:14:09.272
is a disgust with gay sex,
in particular with gay male sex.

00:14:09.272 --> 00:14:12.952
The poor old lesbians just get caught
in the homophobic crossfire. (Laughter)

00:14:12.976 --> 00:14:15.802
You know guilty by association.

00:14:15.838 --> 00:14:21.077
Because what they really
don't like is anal sex,

00:14:21.094 --> 00:14:25.059
sodomy, you know, buggery,

00:14:25.208 --> 00:14:30.258
and they assume that that is all we do.

00:14:30.372 --> 00:14:34.615
They feverishly imagine that we spend all
day jumping around buggering each other.

00:14:34.647 --> 00:14:38.861
I mean they obsess on it, and, in fact,
what they actually do,

00:14:38.861 --> 00:14:44.933
is reduce us down to this one sex act,
whether or not we do it at all,

00:14:44.933 --> 00:14:49.813
because we are not regular people
with the same hopes and aspirations

00:14:49.813 --> 00:14:52.158
and ambitions and feelings
as everyone else,

00:14:52.175 --> 00:14:55.843
we are simply walking sex acts.

00:14:55.933 --> 00:14:59.748
Earlier this year I was invited
to take part

00:14:59.748 --> 00:15:04.808
in the St. Pat's for All parade
in Queens, New York.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:11.650
Now it is a really lovely, charming,
grassroots event in Queens

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:16.052
which was set up in response to
the ban on gay groups marching

00:15:16.052 --> 00:15:20.042
in the famous Manhattan
St. Patrick's Day Parade.

00:15:20.438 --> 00:15:27.308
In that Manhattan St. Patrick's Day Parade
any Irish group who wants can march,

00:15:27.529 --> 00:15:32.077
Irish policemen can march,
Irish firemen, Irish footballers,

00:15:32.077 --> 00:15:35.892
Irish community groups,
Irish volleyball teams, Irish book clubs.

00:15:35.902 --> 00:15:38.024
Any Irish people who want
to have a good shot

00:15:38.028 --> 00:15:40.120
at being allowed to march
in that parade --

00:15:40.124 --> 00:15:43.072
except for Irish gays,

00:15:43.072 --> 00:15:46.469
because, as far as the organizers
of that parade are concerned,

00:15:46.469 --> 00:15:49.442
gays are nothing more
than walking sex acts,

00:15:49.442 --> 00:15:53.722
and there is no place for buggery
in their parade.

00:15:54.791 --> 00:15:57.757
Now, I actually saw
a small documentary once

00:15:57.757 --> 00:16:01.153
about one of the leaders of
the organizers of that parade,

00:16:01.153 --> 00:16:03.515
they are the Ancient Order of Hibernians,

00:16:03.515 --> 00:16:05.921
and they're like
a Catholic Orange Order

00:16:05.944 --> 00:16:07.800
(Laughter)

00:16:08.056 --> 00:16:10.327
-- they dress the same and everything --

00:16:10.327 --> 00:16:11.729
(Laughter)

00:16:11.729 --> 00:16:15.168
and in the documentary, you know,
he was a nice old fellow,

00:16:15.168 --> 00:16:19.528
and he had this lovely wife,
and they seemed very happy together.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:25.450
And when I looked at them,
I saw this life lived together,

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:29.075
and I imagined if I asked him
about their life together,

00:16:29.075 --> 00:16:33.406
that he would remember
the first time they met,

00:16:33.406 --> 00:16:37.120
he would remember how nervous he was
on their first date together,

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.773
and how proud he was when he turned
and saw her coming up the aisle

00:16:40.773 --> 00:16:43.733
in that dress that she had
fretted over for so long.

00:16:43.747 --> 00:16:45.798
And I imagine that if I asked him,

00:16:45.798 --> 00:16:49.476
he would remember that phone call
to say that she had gone into labor

00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:51.786
and the dash across town,

00:16:51.787 --> 00:16:55.626
and the other time when she
went so far past her due date

00:16:55.626 --> 00:16:58.581
that she promised she would bounce up
and down on a trampoline

00:16:58.581 --> 00:17:02.861
until the baby bounced out of her
and how they laughed so hard about that.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.300
And I imagine he would
remember other occasions

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.881
like when their youngest broke his arm
and cried all the way to the hospital,

00:17:08.881 --> 00:17:13.911
and that other time when she was sick and
he could not sleep alone in the empty bed

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.387
and so in the middle of the night he
got up and went back to the hospital

00:17:17.387 --> 00:17:21.998
even though he knew they wouldn't
let him in to see her at that hour.

00:17:22.232 --> 00:17:25.821
I imagine that he would remember all
of those things and many more.

00:17:25.821 --> 00:17:30.895
All of the small things that go up
to making a relationship

00:17:30.895 --> 00:17:33.671
and making a person a person.

00:17:33.941 --> 00:17:38.291
And when I looked at him,
I imagined all of those things too.

00:17:38.441 --> 00:17:44.321
But when he looks at me
he doesn't see me that way.

00:17:44.761 --> 00:17:48.571
He doesn't see gay people that way.

00:17:48.685 --> 00:17:55.795
To him we are just sex acts and there
is no place for sex acts in his parade.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:03.200
I am forty-five years old
and I am fed up putting up.

00:18:03.214 --> 00:18:05.794
So, I'm not anymore.

00:18:06.196 --> 00:18:09.766
I'm forty-five years old
and I am not putting up anymore

00:18:09.974 --> 00:18:13.433
because I don't have the energy anymore.

00:18:13.473 --> 00:18:16.503
Putting up is exhausting!

00:18:16.567 --> 00:18:19.647
I am forty-five years old
and I'm not putting up anymore

00:18:19.647 --> 00:18:23.257
because I don't have
the patience anymore.

00:18:23.444 --> 00:18:28.419
Forty-five years old! I was born
six months before the Stonewall riots,

00:18:28.419 --> 00:18:32.503
and you have had
forty-five years to work out,

00:18:32.503 --> 00:18:34.773
that despite appearances,

00:18:35.227 --> 00:18:38.741
I am just as ordinary,
just as unremarkable,

00:18:38.741 --> 00:18:41.641
and just as human as you are!

00:18:41.927 --> 00:18:48.347
I'm forty-five years old
and I am not asking anymore

00:18:48.585 --> 00:18:53.295
I am just being -- human being!

00:18:53.448 --> 00:18:55.318
Thank you for your time!

00:18:55.379 --> 00:18:57.379
(Applause)

00:19:01.995 --> 00:19:04.142
Thank you! Thank you!

00:19:04.142 --> 00:19:06.142
(Applause)
