00:00:13.032 --> 00:00:14.562
Look all around you.

00:00:14.586 --> 00:00:20.286
Whether you're in a subway, a park,
an airport, a restaurant,

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.029
even at this conference,

00:00:22.053 --> 00:00:25.441
all of you have a phone in your hands
or maybe in your pockets.

00:00:25.465 --> 00:00:27.291
How many of you have a book?

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:28.465
Very few, right?

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:30.946
This is the sight that used to greet me

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.077
every time I walked out
of my office block.

00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:36.752
I was surrounded by a sea
of 20-something professionals

00:00:36.776 --> 00:00:38.243
glued to their phones.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.038
And not a single one
had a book in their hands.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.195
And this used to make me
very, very frustrated.

00:00:44.505 --> 00:00:46.671
I was a bookworm all my life.

00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:49.403
Books formed the milestones of my life.

00:00:49.427 --> 00:00:52.474
The first man I fell
in love with was Mr. Darcy.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.080
I first read "Harry Potter" when I was 21,
on a summer break from college.

00:00:58.601 --> 00:01:02.990
And I remember the first night I spent
in a little flat I bought in my mid-20s,

00:01:03.014 --> 00:01:04.426
very proudly,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.355
and I spent the whole night
reading "The Da Vinci Code."

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:09.688
And then I'm going to make
a terrible confession:

00:01:09.712 --> 00:01:13.391
even today, when I'm low,
I get into bed with "War and Peace."

00:01:13.415 --> 00:01:14.565
Don't laugh.

00:01:14.589 --> 00:01:15.620
(Laughter)

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.331
But I was also like all those
people I saw around me:

00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:21.029
I, too, lived on my phone.

00:01:21.053 --> 00:01:23.537
I ordered my groceries online,

00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:27.695
and soon my app knew
that I needed a monthly dose of diapers.

00:01:28.339 --> 00:01:31.220
I booked my cinemas on my phone.

00:01:31.244 --> 00:01:33.913
I booked planes on my phone.

00:01:33.937 --> 00:01:38.326
And when I did the long commute back home
like most urban Indians,

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.143
and was stuck in traffic,

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:44.057
I passed the time on WhatsApp,
video-chatting my twin.

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:49.803
I was part of an extraordinary revolution
that was happening in India.

00:01:49.827 --> 00:01:53.957
Indians are the second-largest
users of smartphones in the world.

00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:58.323
And data prices have been
slashed so radically

00:01:58.347 --> 00:02:02.045
that half of urban India
and even a part of rural India

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.347
now have a smartphone
with a data connection in their hands.

00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:07.204
And if you know anything about India,

00:02:07.228 --> 00:02:10.554
you'll know that "half" means,
like, all of America or something.

00:02:10.578 --> 00:02:12.125
You know, it's large numbers.

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:13.299
(Laughter)

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.998
And these numbers are just growing
and growing and growing.

00:02:17.022 --> 00:02:18.204
They're exploding.

00:02:18.228 --> 00:02:20.300
And what they're doing
is empowering Indians

00:02:20.324 --> 00:02:22.782
in all kinds of extraordinary ways.

00:02:22.806 --> 00:02:26.244
And yet, none of these changes
that I was seeing around me

00:02:26.268 --> 00:02:29.174
were reflected in my world,
my world of books.

00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:33.101
I live in a country the size of Europe,

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:35.594
and it only has 50 decent bookshops.

00:02:36.053 --> 00:02:39.290
And Indians just didn't seem
to want to read for fun.

00:02:39.314 --> 00:02:41.825
So if you look at all
the best-seller lists in India,

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.070
what you'll always find
in the best-seller list

00:02:44.094 --> 00:02:45.909
is exam and professional guides.

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:49.928
Imagine if you found the SAT guides
as the "New York Times" number one seller,

00:02:49.953 --> 00:02:51.417
month after month.

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:58.459
And yet, the smartphone revolution
was creating readers and writers

00:02:58.484 --> 00:03:00.229
of a different kind.

00:03:00.254 --> 00:03:03.095
Whether it was on Facebook or WhatsApp,

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:07.960
Indians were writing and sharing
and reading all kinds of things:

00:03:07.984 --> 00:03:11.698
terrible jokes, spurious pop history,

00:03:11.722 --> 00:03:14.398
long, emotional confessions,

00:03:14.422 --> 00:03:16.593
diatribes against the government.

00:03:16.617 --> 00:03:19.903
And as I read and shared these things,
I wondered to myself,

00:03:19.927 --> 00:03:24.189
"Could I get these writers
and these readers,

00:03:24.213 --> 00:03:26.546
could I turn them into my readers?"

00:03:27.212 --> 00:03:29.895
And so I left my plush corner office

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:34.291
and my job as the publisher
of India's top publishing company,

00:03:34.315 --> 00:03:35.993
and I set up on my own.

00:03:36.017 --> 00:03:42.720
I moved into a single large room
in a cheap bohemian district of Delhi,

00:03:42.744 --> 00:03:44.058
with a small team.

00:03:44.402 --> 00:03:47.376
And there, I set up
a new kind of publishing house.

00:03:48.355 --> 00:03:51.765
A new kind of publishing house
needs a new kind of reader

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:53.322
and a new kind of book.

00:03:54.218 --> 00:03:57.138
And so I asked myself,
"What would this new reader want?

00:03:57.162 --> 00:04:00.956
Would they prize urgency, relevance,

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.258
timeliness, directness --

00:04:03.282 --> 00:04:06.958
the very qualities they seem to want
from their online services,

00:04:06.982 --> 00:04:10.120
indeed, the qualities they seem
to want from life today?"

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:13.783
I knew that my readers
were always on the go.

00:04:13.807 --> 00:04:16.728
I'd have to fit into
their lifestyle and schedules.

00:04:16.752 --> 00:04:19.810
Would they actually want to read
a 200-page book?

00:04:19.834 --> 00:04:22.947
Or would they want something
a little bit more digestible?

00:04:23.676 --> 00:04:26.652
Indians are incredibly value-conscious,

00:04:26.676 --> 00:04:29.220
especially when it comes
to their online reading.

00:04:29.244 --> 00:04:32.636
I knew I had to give them
books under a dollar.

00:04:33.735 --> 00:04:37.167
And so my company was formed,
and it was born.

00:04:37.191 --> 00:04:43.426
It was a platform where we created a list
of stories designed for the smartphone,

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.625
but it also allowed amateur writers
to upload their own stories,

00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:50.220
so they could be showcased
along with the very writers

00:04:50.244 --> 00:04:51.974
they read and admired.

00:04:51.998 --> 00:04:56.506
And we could also enter into
other people's digital platforms.

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:58.785
So, imagine this:

00:04:58.809 --> 00:05:02.173
imagine you're a receptionist,
you've had a long day at work,

00:05:02.197 --> 00:05:04.644
you book your cab
in your ride-hailing app,

00:05:04.668 --> 00:05:06.007
it shows up,

00:05:06.031 --> 00:05:08.911
and you get into your car,
and you lie back on your seat,

00:05:08.935 --> 00:05:11.101
and you put on your app.

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:15.187
And you find a set of stories
waiting for you, timed to your journey.

00:05:16.347 --> 00:05:18.514
Imagine you're a gay young woman,

00:05:18.538 --> 00:05:22.842
in a relatively conservative city
like Lucknow, which lies near Delhi.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.022
There's no way your parents
know about your sexuality.

00:05:26.046 --> 00:05:27.912
They'd completely freak out.

00:05:28.403 --> 00:05:34.315
Would you like lesbian love stories
written in Hindi, priced under a dollar,

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:36.728
to be read in the privacy of your phone?

00:05:37.244 --> 00:05:39.855
And could I match readers

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:44.189
to the events that were taking place
around them in real time?

00:05:44.982 --> 00:05:49.156
So we published biographies
of very famous politicians

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.941
after they won big elections.

00:05:52.633 --> 00:05:56.188
When the supreme court
decriminalized homosexuality,

00:05:56.212 --> 00:05:59.959
an LGBTQ collection was waiting
on our home page.

00:06:00.482 --> 00:06:05.591
And when India's Toni Morrison,
the great writer Mahasweta Devi died,

00:06:05.615 --> 00:06:09.460
our readers found a short story by her
as soon as news hit.

00:06:10.046 --> 00:06:14.807
The idea was to be relevant
to every moment of a reader's life.

00:06:15.823 --> 00:06:17.157
Who are our readers?

00:06:17.562 --> 00:06:20.657
They're mostly young men
under the age of 30.

00:06:20.681 --> 00:06:22.665
There's someone like Salil,

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:25.768
who lives in a city where
there isn't a modern bookshop.

00:06:25.792 --> 00:06:28.525
And he comes to our app almost every day.

00:06:28.852 --> 00:06:30.678
There's someone like Manoj,

00:06:30.702 --> 00:06:33.894
who mostly reads us
during the long commute back home.

00:06:34.266 --> 00:06:37.861
And there's someone like Ahmed,
who loves our nonfiction

00:06:37.885 --> 00:06:41.847
that he can read in a single sitting,
and that's priced very low.

00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:45.832
Imagine if you're like a young, techie boy

00:06:45.856 --> 00:06:50.187
in India's Silicon Valley
city of Bangalore.

00:06:51.031 --> 00:06:53.578
And one day, you get
an in-app notification

00:06:53.602 --> 00:06:57.053
and it says that your favorite actress
has written a sexy short story

00:06:57.077 --> 00:06:58.672
and it's waiting for you.

00:06:58.696 --> 00:07:00.768
That's how we launched Juggernaut.

00:07:00.792 --> 00:07:05.188
We got a very famous ex-adult star,
called Sunny Leone.

00:07:05.212 --> 00:07:08.347
She's India's most Googled
person, as it happens.

00:07:08.371 --> 00:07:12.395
And we got her to write us
a collection of sexy short stories

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:14.958
that we published every night for a week.

00:07:14.982 --> 00:07:16.410
And it was a sensation.

00:07:16.434 --> 00:07:20.034
I mean, no one could believe
that we'd asked Sunny Leone to write.

00:07:20.466 --> 00:07:21.626
But she did,

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.212
and she proved everyone wrong,

00:07:24.236 --> 00:07:26.577
and she found this immense readership.

00:07:27.084 --> 00:07:32.704
And just as we've redefined
what a book is and how a reader behaves,

00:07:32.728 --> 00:07:35.204
we're rethinking who an author is.

00:07:35.228 --> 00:07:36.881
In our amateur writing platform,

00:07:36.905 --> 00:07:39.915
we have writers that range
from teenagers to housewives.

00:07:40.315 --> 00:07:42.397
And they're writing all kinds of things.

00:07:42.421 --> 00:07:47.863
It starts as small as a poem,
an essay, a single short story ...

00:07:48.292 --> 00:07:51.739
Fifty percent of them are returning
to the app to write again.

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:53.999
Take someone like Neeraj.

00:07:54.024 --> 00:07:59.028
He's a middle-aged executive,
wife, two kids, a good job.

00:07:59.053 --> 00:08:00.815
And Neeraj loves to read.

00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:03.673
But every time Neeraj read
a book that he loved,

00:08:03.697 --> 00:08:05.871
he was also filled with regret.

00:08:05.895 --> 00:08:08.505
He wondered to himself
if he could write, too.

00:08:08.529 --> 00:08:10.974
He was convinced
he had stories in his mind.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:16.410
But time and real life had happened,
and he couldn't really manage it.

00:08:16.434 --> 00:08:19.648
And then he heard about
the Juggernaut writer's platform.

00:08:19.672 --> 00:08:23.522
And what he loved about it
was that he felt this was a place

00:08:23.546 --> 00:08:26.612
where he could stand
head and shoulders, equally,

00:08:26.637 --> 00:08:29.141
with the very writers
that he most admired.

00:08:29.165 --> 00:08:30.831
And so he began to write.

00:08:31.252 --> 00:08:35.014
And he snatched
a minute here, an hour there,

00:08:35.038 --> 00:08:37.252
in between flights in airports,

00:08:37.276 --> 00:08:40.240
late at night, when he had
a little bit of time on his hands.

00:08:40.867 --> 00:08:43.184
And he wrote this
extraordinary story for us.

00:08:43.208 --> 00:08:46.033
He wrote a story
about a family of assassins

00:08:46.057 --> 00:08:49.057
who lived in the winding
lanes of Old Delhi.

00:08:49.371 --> 00:08:52.251
We loved it, it was so fresh and original.

00:08:52.275 --> 00:08:56.712
And before Neeraj knew it,
he'd not only scored a film deal

00:08:56.736 --> 00:09:00.011
but also a second contract
to write another story.

00:09:00.323 --> 00:09:04.190
Neeraj's story is one of the most read
stories on our app.

00:09:05.619 --> 00:09:08.135
My journey is very, very young.

00:09:08.159 --> 00:09:11.911
We're a two-year-old company,
and we have a long way to go.

00:09:12.984 --> 00:09:16.004
But we already, and we will
by the end of this year,

00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:19.984
have about half a million stories,
many priced at under a dollar.

00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:23.935
Most of our readers love reading

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:27.093
and trying out authors
they've never, ever heard of before.

00:09:27.117 --> 00:09:29.577
Thirty percent of our home page reads

00:09:29.601 --> 00:09:33.010
comes out of the writing
that comes from our writer's platform.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.321
By being everywhere,

00:09:36.345 --> 00:09:38.925
by being accessible and relevant,

00:09:39.734 --> 00:09:42.514
I hope to make reading a daily habit,

00:09:42.538 --> 00:09:45.761
as easy and effortless
as checking your email,

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.490
as booking a ticket online

00:09:48.514 --> 00:09:50.101
or ordering your groceries.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.395
And as for me,

00:09:52.419 --> 00:09:56.516
I've discovered that as I entered
the six-inch world of the smartphone,

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.006
my own world just got very, very big.

00:10:00.484 --> 00:10:01.682
Thank you.

00:10:01.706 --> 00:10:05.586
(Applause)
