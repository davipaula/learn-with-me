00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:13.899
I think stairs may be

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.417
one of the most emotionally
malleable physical elements

00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:21.112
that an architect has to work with.

00:00:21.137 --> 00:00:23.566
[Small thing. Big idea.]

00:00:24.772 --> 00:00:27.293
[David Rockwell on
the Stairs]

00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:31.110
At its most basic, a stair is a way
to get from point A to point B

00:00:31.134 --> 00:00:32.713
at different elevations.

00:00:32.737 --> 00:00:35.269
Stairs have a common language.

00:00:35.293 --> 00:00:38.126
Treads, which is the thing
that you walk on.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.063
Riser, which is the vertical element
that separates the two treads.

00:00:42.087 --> 00:00:45.967
A lot of stairs have nosings
that create a kind of edge.

00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:48.762
And then, the connected piece
is a stringer.

00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:53.361
Those pieces, in different forms,
make up all stairs.

00:00:53.783 --> 00:00:56.616
I assume stairs came to be
from the first time someone said,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.664
"I want to get to this higher rock
from the lower rock."

00:00:59.688 --> 00:01:01.910
People climbed
using whatever was available:

00:01:01.934 --> 00:01:04.157
stepped logs, ladders

00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:06.846
and natural pathways
that were worn over time.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.513
Some of the earliest staircases,
like the pyramids in Chichén Itzá

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:12.822
or the roads to Mount Tai in China,

00:01:12.846 --> 00:01:15.360
were a means of getting
to a higher elevation,

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:18.822
which people sought
for worship or for protection.

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:22.656
As engineering has evolved,
so has what's practical.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.370
Stairs can be made
from all kinds of material.

00:01:25.394 --> 00:01:27.775
There are linear stairs,
there are spiraled stairs.

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.338
Stairs can be indoors,
they can be outdoors.

00:01:30.362 --> 00:01:32.680
They clearly help us in an emergency.

00:01:32.704 --> 00:01:35.574
But they're also a form of art
in and of themselves.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.885
As we move across a stairway,

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.249
the form dictates our pacing,
our feeling, our safety

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:51.059
and our relationship and engagement
with the space around us.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.249
So for a second, think about stepping down
a gradual, monumental staircase

00:01:56.273 --> 00:01:58.750
like the one in front
of the New York Public Library.

00:01:59.201 --> 00:02:00.400
From those steps,

00:02:00.424 --> 00:02:03.646
you have a view of the street
and all the people around you,

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.702
and your walk is slow and steady
because the tread is so wide.

00:02:07.726 --> 00:02:09.980
That's a totally different experience

00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:13.023
than going down the narrow staircase
to, say, an old pub,

00:02:13.047 --> 00:02:14.696
where you spill into the room.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.172
There, you encounter tall risers,
so you move more quickly.

00:02:18.196 --> 00:02:20.313
Stairs add enormous drama.

00:02:20.337 --> 00:02:23.744
Think about how stairs
signaled a grand entrance

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:25.623
and were the star of that moment.

00:02:25.647 --> 00:02:27.287
Stairs can even be heroic.

00:02:27.311 --> 00:02:30.599
The staircase that remained standing
after September 11th

00:02:30.623 --> 00:02:32.639
and the attack on the World Trade Center

00:02:32.663 --> 00:02:34.535
was dubbed the "Survivors' Staircase,"

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:38.598
because it played such a central role
in leading hundreds of people to safety.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.960
But small stairs
can have a huge impact, too.

00:02:41.984 --> 00:02:44.963
The stoop is a place
that invites neighbors to gather,

00:02:44.987 --> 00:02:47.721
blast music, and watch the city in motion.

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.718
It's fascinating to me that you see people
wanting to hang out on the stairs.

00:02:51.742 --> 00:02:56.377
I think they fill
a deeply human need we have

00:02:56.401 --> 00:03:00.603
to inhabit a space
more than just on the ground plane.

00:03:00.627 --> 00:03:04.157
And so if you're able to sit
halfway up there,

00:03:05.086 --> 00:03:06.903
you're in a kind of magical place.
