00:00:14.171 --> 00:00:16.490
The ancient Greeks had a great idea:

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.328
The universe is simple.

00:00:18.328 --> 00:00:19.288
In their minds,

00:00:19.288 --> 00:00:21.450
all you needed to make it were four elements:

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.041
earth,

00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:22.569
air,

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:23.125
fire,

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:24.565
and water.

00:00:24.565 --> 00:00:26.921
As theories go, it's a beautiful one.

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:28.898
It has simplicity and elegance.

00:00:28.898 --> 00:00:30.314
It says that by combining

00:00:30.314 --> 00:00:32.176
the four basic elements in different ways,

00:00:32.176 --> 00:00:35.346
you could produce all the wonderful diversity of the universe.

00:00:35.346 --> 00:00:36.817
Earth and fire, for example,

00:00:36.817 --> 00:00:38.975
give you things that are dry.

00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:41.822
Air and water, things that are wet.

00:00:41.822 --> 00:00:43.906
But as theories go, it had a problem.

00:00:43.906 --> 00:00:46.690
It didn't predict anything that could be measured,

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.987
and measurement is the basis of experimental science.

00:00:49.987 --> 00:00:52.196
Worse still, the theory was wrong.

00:00:52.196 --> 00:00:54.698
But the Greeks were great scientists of the mind

00:00:54.698 --> 00:00:56.033
and in the 5th century B.C.,

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:57.792
Leucippus of Miletus came up

00:00:57.792 --> 00:01:01.080
with one of the most enduring scientific ideas ever.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.530
Everything we see is made up

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.870
of tiny, indivisible bits of stuff called atoms.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.958
This theory is simple and elegant,

00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.037
and it has the advantage

00:01:09.037 --> 00:01:11.423
over the earth, air, fire, and water theory

00:01:11.423 --> 00:01:12.598
of being right.

00:01:12.598 --> 00:01:15.238
Centuries of scientific thought and experimentation

00:01:15.238 --> 00:01:17.002
have established that the real elements,

00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:18.354
things like hydrogen,

00:01:18.354 --> 00:01:18.878
carbon,

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:19.741
and iron,

00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:21.661
can be broken down into atoms.

00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:24.078
In Leucippus's theory, the atom is the smallest,

00:01:24.078 --> 00:01:26.938
indivisible bit of stuff that's still recognizable

00:01:26.938 --> 00:01:27.720
as hydrogen,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.252
carbon,

00:01:28.268 --> 00:01:29.049
or iron.

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.923
The only thing wrong with Leucippus's idea

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:33.497
is that atoms are, in fact, divisible.

00:01:33.497 --> 00:01:35.742
Furthermore, his atoms idea turns out

00:01:35.742 --> 00:01:37.129
to explain just a small part

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:39.035
of what the universe is made of.

00:01:39.035 --> 00:01:41.333
What appears to be the ordinary stuff of the universe

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.713
is, in fact, quite rare.

00:01:42.713 --> 00:01:45.849
Leucippus's atoms, and the things they're made of,

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:47.687
actually make up only about 5%

00:01:47.687 --> 00:01:49.220
of what we know to be there.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.804
Physicists know the rest of the universe,

00:01:50.804 --> 00:01:52.182
95% of it,

00:01:52.182 --> 00:01:53.975
as the dark universe,

00:01:53.975 --> 00:01:56.643
made of dark matter and dark energy.

00:01:56.643 --> 00:01:57.607
How do we know this?

00:01:57.607 --> 00:02:00.023
Well, we know because we look at things

00:02:00.023 --> 00:02:01.024
and we see them.

00:02:01.024 --> 00:02:02.316
That might seem rather simplistic,

00:02:02.316 --> 00:02:03.860
but it's actually quite profound.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.197
All the stuff that's made of atoms is visible.

00:02:06.197 --> 00:02:08.784
Light bounces off it, and we can see it.

00:02:08.784 --> 00:02:09.844
When we look out into space,

00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:11.540
we see stars and galaxies.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.537
Some of them, like the one we live in,

00:02:13.537 --> 00:02:17.165
are beautiful, spiral shapes, spinning gracefully through space.

00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:18.794
When scientists first measured the motion

00:02:18.794 --> 00:02:20.966
of groups of galaxies in the 1930's

00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:23.254
and weighed the amount of matter they contained,

00:02:23.254 --> 00:02:24.630
they were in for a surprise.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.298
They found that there's not enough visible stuff

00:02:26.298 --> 00:02:28.349
in those groups to hold them together.

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.348
Later measurements of individual galaxies

00:02:30.348 --> 00:02:32.096
confirmed this puzzling result.

00:02:32.096 --> 00:02:34.183
There's simply not enough visible stuff in galaxies

00:02:34.183 --> 00:02:36.769
to provide enough gravity to hold them together.

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:37.770
From what we can see,

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.855
they ought to fly apart, but they don't.

00:02:39.855 --> 00:02:40.980
So there must be stuff there

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.399
that we can't see.

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:44.578
We call that stuff dark matter.

00:02:44.578 --> 00:02:46.563
The best evidence for dark matter today

00:02:46.563 --> 00:02:47.822
comes from measurements of something

00:02:47.822 --> 00:02:49.573
called the cosmic microwave background,

00:02:49.573 --> 00:02:51.074
the afterglow of the Big Bang,

00:02:51.074 --> 00:02:52.450
but that's another story.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.707
All of the evidence we have

00:02:53.707 --> 00:02:55.286
says that dark matter is there

00:02:55.286 --> 00:02:56.873
and it accounts for much of the stuff

00:02:56.873 --> 00:02:58.665
in those beautiful spiral galaxies

00:02:58.665 --> 00:03:00.191
that fill the heavens.

00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:01.989
So where does that leave us?

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.605
We've long known that the heavens

00:03:03.605 --> 00:03:05.261
do not revolve around us

00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:07.793
and that we're residents of a fairly ordinary planet,

00:03:07.793 --> 00:03:09.485
orbiting a fairly ordinary star,

00:03:09.485 --> 00:03:12.135
in the spiral arm of a fairly ordinary galaxy.

00:03:12.135 --> 00:03:14.030
The discovery of dark matter took us

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.977
one step further away from the center of things.

00:03:16.977 --> 00:03:18.478
It told us that the stuff we're made of

00:03:18.478 --> 00:03:21.688
is only a small fraction of what makes up the universe.

00:03:21.688 --> 00:03:22.998
But there was more to come.

00:03:22.998 --> 00:03:23.898
Early this century,

00:03:23.898 --> 00:03:26.234
scientists studying the outer reaches of the universe

00:03:26.234 --> 00:03:28.778
confirmed that not only is everything moving apart

00:03:28.778 --> 00:03:30.196
from everything else,

00:03:30.196 --> 00:03:31.492
as you would expect in a universe

00:03:31.492 --> 00:03:33.599
that began in hot, dense big bang,

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.266
but that the universe's expansion

00:03:35.266 --> 00:03:37.511
also seems to be accelerating.

00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:38.955
What's that about?

00:03:38.955 --> 00:03:40.678
Either there is some kind of energy

00:03:40.678 --> 00:03:41.956
pushing this acceleration,

00:03:41.956 --> 00:03:44.450
just like you provide energy to accelerate a car,

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.238
or gravity does not behave exactly as we think.

00:03:47.238 --> 00:03:49.875
Most scientists think it's the former,

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:52.919
that there's some kind of energy driving the acceleration,

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.170
and they called it &lt;i&gt;dark energy&lt;/i&gt;.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.006
Today's best measurements allow us to work out

00:03:57.006 --> 00:03:59.300
just how much of the universe is dark.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.925
It looks as if dark energy makes up

00:04:00.925 --> 00:04:02.761
about 68% of the universe

00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:05.238
and dark matter about 27%,

00:04:05.238 --> 00:04:07.097
leaving just 5% for us

00:04:07.097 --> 00:04:09.599
and everything else we can actually see.

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.209
So what's the dark stuff made of?

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:11.851
We don't know,

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:13.755
but there's one theory, called &lt;i&gt;supersymmetry&lt;/i&gt;,

00:04:13.755 --> 00:04:15.605
that could explain some of it.

00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:18.262
Supersymmetry, or SUSY for short,

00:04:18.262 --> 00:04:19.997
predicts a whole range of new particles,

00:04:19.997 --> 00:04:21.957
some of which could make up the dark matter.

00:04:21.957 --> 00:04:23.785
If we found evidence for SUSY,

00:04:23.785 --> 00:04:26.311
we could go from understanding 5% of our universe,

00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:27.715
the things we can actually see,

00:04:27.715 --> 00:04:29.172
to around a third.

00:04:29.172 --> 00:04:30.841
Not bad for a day's work.

00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:33.094
Dark energy would probably be harder to understand,

00:04:33.094 --> 00:04:34.964
but there are some speculative theories out there

00:04:34.964 --> 00:04:36.263
that might point the way.

00:04:36.263 --> 00:04:37.374
Among them are theories that go back

00:04:37.374 --> 00:04:39.916
to that first great idea of the ancient Greeks,

00:04:39.916 --> 00:04:42.421
the idea that we began with several minutes ago,

00:04:42.421 --> 00:04:45.120
the idea that the universe must be simple.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.139
These theories predict that there is just a single element

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.933
from which all the universe's wonderful diversity stems,

00:04:49.933 --> 00:04:51.595
a vibrating string.

00:04:51.595 --> 00:04:53.764
The idea is that all the particles we know today

00:04:53.764 --> 00:04:56.183
are just different harmonics on the string.

00:04:56.183 --> 00:04:57.999
Unfortunately, string theories today

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:59.556
are, as yet, untestable.

00:04:59.556 --> 00:05:01.772
But, with so much of the universe waiting to be explored,

00:05:01.772 --> 00:05:03.358
the stakes are high.

00:05:03.358 --> 00:05:05.442
Does all of this make you feel small?

00:05:05.442 --> 00:05:06.609
It shouldn't.

00:05:06.609 --> 00:05:08.001
Instead, you should marvel

00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:09.447
in the fact that, as far as we know,

00:05:09.447 --> 00:05:12.013
you are a member of the only species in the universe

00:05:12.013 --> 00:05:14.715
able even to begin to grasp its wonders,

00:05:14.715 --> 00:05:16.035
and you're living at the right time

00:05:16.035 --> 00:05:18.706
to see our understanding explode.
