00:00:06.494 --> 00:00:09.888
An enduring myth says we use
only 10% of our brain,

00:00:09.912 --> 00:00:13.477
the other 90% standing idly by
for spare capacity.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.400
Hucksters promised to unlock
that hidden potential

00:00:16.424 --> 00:00:19.483
with methods "based on neuroscience,"

00:00:19.507 --> 00:00:21.706
but all they really unlock is your wallet.

00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:25.285
Two-thirds of the public
and nearly half of science teachers

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:27.836
mistakenly believe the 10% myth.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.035
In the 1890s, William James,

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:32.815
the father of American psychology, said,

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:35.233
"Most of us do not meet
our mental potential."

00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:37.337
James meant this as a challenge,

00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:39.802
not an indictment of scant brain usage.

00:00:39.826 --> 00:00:41.711
But the misunderstanding stuck.

00:00:42.016 --> 00:00:45.223
Also, scientists couldn't
figure out for a long time

00:00:45.247 --> 00:00:47.553
the purpose of our massive frontal lobes

00:00:47.577 --> 00:00:50.139
or broad areas of the parietal lobe.

00:00:50.163 --> 00:00:53.057
Damage didn't cause motor
or sensory deficits,

00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:56.020
so authorities concluded
they didn't do anything.

00:00:56.687 --> 00:00:59.442
For decades, these parts
were called silent areas,

00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.101
their function elusive.

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:03.230
We've since learned that they underscore

00:01:03.254 --> 00:01:04.944
executive and integrative ability,

00:01:04.968 --> 00:01:07.199
without which, we would hardly be human.

00:01:07.223 --> 00:01:09.239
They are crucial to abstract reasoning,

00:01:09.263 --> 00:01:10.784
planning, weighing decisions

00:01:10.808 --> 00:01:13.213
and flexibly adapting to circumstances.

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:17.310
The idea that 9/10 of your brain
sits idly by in your skull

00:01:17.334 --> 00:01:20.564
looks silly when we calculate
how the brain uses energy.

00:01:21.064 --> 00:01:22.825
Rodent and canine brains

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:25.424
consume 5% of total body energy.

00:01:25.448 --> 00:01:27.261
Monkey brains use 10%.

00:01:27.717 --> 00:01:29.096
An adult human brain,

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.808
which accounts for only 2%
of the body's mass,

00:01:31.832 --> 00:01:35.446
consumes 20% of daily glucose burned.

00:01:35.884 --> 00:01:38.226
In children, that figure is 50%,

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.386
and in infants, 60%.

00:01:40.964 --> 00:01:44.194
This is far more than expected
for their relative brain sizes,

00:01:44.218 --> 00:01:46.612
which scale in proportion to body size.

00:01:46.636 --> 00:01:48.893
Human ones weigh 1.5 kilograms,

00:01:48.917 --> 00:01:50.616
elephant brains 5 kg,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.726
and whale brains 9 kg,

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.643
yet on a per weight basis,

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:58.373
humans pack in more neurons
than any other species.

00:01:58.397 --> 00:02:01.019
This dense packing
is what makes us so smart.

00:02:01.585 --> 00:02:03.544
There is a trade-off between body size

00:02:03.568 --> 00:02:05.590
and the number of neurons a primate,

00:02:05.614 --> 00:02:07.165
including us, can sustain.

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.666
A 25 kg ape has to eat 8 hours a day

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.751
to uphold a brain with 53 billion neurons.

00:02:14.673 --> 00:02:15.993
The invention of cooking,

00:02:16.017 --> 00:02:17.494
one and half million years ago,

00:02:17.518 --> 00:02:19.319
gave us a huge advantage.

00:02:19.343 --> 00:02:22.336
Cooked food is rendered
soft and predigested

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.618
outside of the body.

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:26.074
Our guts more easily absorb its energy.

00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:29.153
Cooking frees up time
and provides more energy

00:02:29.177 --> 00:02:30.979
than if we ate food stuffs raw

00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:33.013
and so we can sustain brains

00:02:33.037 --> 00:02:36.038
with 86 billion densely packed neurons.

00:02:36.474 --> 00:02:38.030
40% more than the ape.

00:02:38.548 --> 00:02:39.834
Here's how it works.

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:41.709
Half the calories a brain burns

00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:43.924
go towards simply keeping
the structure intact

00:02:43.948 --> 00:02:46.678
by pumping sodium and potassium ions

00:02:46.702 --> 00:02:49.891
across membranes
to maintain an electrical charge.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:53.178
To do this, the brain
has to be an energy hog.

00:02:53.202 --> 00:02:54.888
It consumes an astounding

00:02:54.912 --> 00:03:00.357
3.4 x 10^21 ATP molecules per minute,

00:03:00.381 --> 00:03:02.990
ATP being the coal of the body's furnace.

00:03:03.563 --> 00:03:05.930
The high cost of maintaining
resting potentials

00:03:05.954 --> 00:03:08.194
in all 86 billion neurons

00:03:08.218 --> 00:03:09.975
means that little energy is left

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:13.458
to propel signals down axons
and across synapses,

00:03:13.482 --> 00:03:16.345
the nerve discharges
that actually get things done.

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:19.289
Even if only a tiny percentage of neurons

00:03:19.313 --> 00:03:22.153
fired in a given region at any one time,

00:03:22.177 --> 00:03:26.120
the energy burden of generating spikes
over the entire brain

00:03:26.144 --> 00:03:27.438
would be unsustainable.

00:03:28.097 --> 00:03:30.405
Here's where energy efficiency comes in.

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:34.871
Letting just a small proportion of cells
signal at any one time,

00:03:34.895 --> 00:03:36.788
known as sparse coding,

00:03:36.812 --> 00:03:38.348
uses the least energy,

00:03:38.372 --> 00:03:40.642
but carries the most information.

00:03:40.666 --> 00:03:42.895
Because the small number of signals

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.956
have thousands of possible paths
by which to distribute themselves.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.004
A drawback of sparse coding
within a huge number of neurons

00:03:50.028 --> 00:03:51.330
is its cost.

00:03:51.354 --> 00:03:54.155
Worse, if a big proportion
of cells never fire,

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:55.575
then they are superfluous

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.810
and evolution should have
jettisoned them long ago.

00:03:58.834 --> 00:04:02.321
The solution is to find
the optimum proportion of cells

00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:04.372
that the brain can have active at once.

00:04:04.396 --> 00:04:05.986
For maximum efficiency,

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.730
between 1% and 16% of cells
should be active at any given moment.

00:04:11.263 --> 00:04:13.824
This is the energy limit
we have to live with

00:04:13.848 --> 00:04:15.372
in order to be conscious at all.

00:04:15.396 --> 00:04:16.935
The need to conserve resources

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.267
is the reason
most of the brain's operations

00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:21.697
must happen outside of consciousness.

00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:24.169
It's why multitasking is a fool's errand.

00:04:24.193 --> 00:04:26.947
We simply lack the energy
to do two things at once,

00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:28.759
let alone three or five.

00:04:28.783 --> 00:04:30.891
When we try, we do each task less well

00:04:30.915 --> 00:04:33.219
than if we had given it
our full attention.

00:04:33.243 --> 00:04:34.747
The numbers are against us.

00:04:35.049 --> 00:04:37.387
Your brain is already smart and powerful.

00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:41.030
So powerful that it needs
a lot of power to stay powerful.

00:04:41.054 --> 00:04:42.230
And so smart

00:04:42.254 --> 00:04:44.895
that it has built in
an energy-efficiency plan.

00:04:45.422 --> 00:04:47.992
So don't let a fraudulent myth
make you guilty

00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:49.799
about your supposedly lazy brain.

00:04:49.823 --> 00:04:51.738
Guilt would be a waste of energy.

00:04:51.762 --> 00:04:52.809
After all this,

00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:55.281
don't you realize
it's dumb to waste mental energy?

00:04:55.305 --> 00:04:58.080
You have billions of
power-hungry neurons to maintain.

00:04:58.104 --> 00:04:59.210
So hop to it!
