00:00:13.286 --> 00:00:17.317
The most important gift
your mother and father ever gave you

00:00:17.341 --> 00:00:20.061
was the two sets
of three billion letters of DNA

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:21.649
that make up your genome.

00:00:22.014 --> 00:00:24.491
But like anything
with three billion components,

00:00:24.515 --> 00:00:25.915
that gift is fragile.

00:00:26.815 --> 00:00:30.355
Sunlight, smoking, unhealthy eating,

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:33.371
even spontaneous mistakes
made by your cells,

00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:35.318
all cause changes to your genome.

00:00:36.942 --> 00:00:40.220
The most common kind of change in DNA

00:00:40.244 --> 00:00:44.473
is the simple swap of one letter,
or base, such as C,

00:00:44.497 --> 00:00:47.738
with a different letter,
such as T, G or A.

00:00:48.744 --> 00:00:52.117
In any day, the cells in your body
will collectively accumulate

00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:56.977
billions of these single-letter swaps,
which are also called "point mutations."

00:00:58.147 --> 00:01:00.678
Now, most of these
point mutations are harmless.

00:01:00.702 --> 00:01:01.860
But every now and then,

00:01:01.884 --> 00:01:05.877
a point mutation disrupts
an important capability in a cell

00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:09.256
or causes a cell to misbehave
in harmful ways.

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:13.098
If that mutation were inherited
from your parents

00:01:13.122 --> 00:01:15.782
or occurred early enough
in your development,

00:01:15.806 --> 00:01:18.772
then the result would be
that many or all of your cells

00:01:18.796 --> 00:01:20.708
contain this harmful mutation.

00:01:21.153 --> 00:01:24.423
And then you would be one
of hundreds of millions of people

00:01:24.447 --> 00:01:26.058
with a genetic disease,

00:01:26.082 --> 00:01:29.085
such as sickle cell anemia or progeria

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.230
or muscular dystrophy
or Tay-Sachs disease.

00:01:34.225 --> 00:01:37.407
Grievous genetic diseases
caused by point mutations

00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:39.424
are especially frustrating,

00:01:39.448 --> 00:01:42.352
because we often know
the exact single-letter change

00:01:42.376 --> 00:01:46.576
that causes the disease
and, in theory, could cure the disease.

00:01:47.268 --> 00:01:50.117
Millions suffer from sickle cell anemia

00:01:50.141 --> 00:01:53.212
because they have
a single A to T point mutations

00:01:53.236 --> 00:01:55.597
in both copies of their hemoglobin gene.

00:01:57.529 --> 00:02:00.661
And children with progeria
are born with a T

00:02:00.685 --> 00:02:02.853
at a single position in their genome

00:02:02.877 --> 00:02:04.276
where you have a C,

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.564
with the devastating consequence
that these wonderful, bright kids

00:02:08.588 --> 00:02:12.564
age very rapidly and pass away
by about age 14.

00:02:14.358 --> 00:02:16.041
Throughout the history of medicine,

00:02:16.065 --> 00:02:19.125
we have not had a way
to efficiently correct point mutations

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:20.918
in living systems,

00:02:20.942 --> 00:02:24.142
to change that disease-causing
T back into a C.

00:02:25.482 --> 00:02:27.450
Perhaps until now.

00:02:27.474 --> 00:02:31.664
Because my laboratory recently succeeded
in developing such a capability,

00:02:31.688 --> 00:02:33.488
which we call "base editing."

00:02:35.277 --> 00:02:37.301
The story of how we developed base editing

00:02:37.325 --> 00:02:39.999
actually begins three billion years ago.

00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:43.715
We think of bacteria
as sources of infection,

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.053
but bacteria themselves are also
prone to being infected,

00:02:47.077 --> 00:02:48.984
in particular, by viruses.

00:02:49.871 --> 00:02:52.022
So about three billion years ago,

00:02:52.046 --> 00:02:55.926
bacteria evolved a defense mechanism
to fight viral infection.

00:02:57.649 --> 00:03:00.434
That defense mechanism
is now better known as CRISPR.

00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:03.833
And the warhead in CRISPR
is this purple protein

00:03:03.857 --> 00:03:07.635
that acts like molecular
scissors to cut DNA,

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.087
breaking the double helix into two pieces.

00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:15.299
If CRISPR couldn't distinguish
between bacterial and viral DNA,

00:03:15.323 --> 00:03:17.562
it wouldn't be a very useful
defense system.

00:03:18.315 --> 00:03:21.100
But the most amazing feature of CRISPR

00:03:21.124 --> 00:03:26.161
is that the scissors can be
programmed to search for,

00:03:26.185 --> 00:03:28.608
bind to and cut

00:03:28.632 --> 00:03:31.370
only a specific DNA sequence.

00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:36.308
So when a bacterium encounters
a virus for the first time,

00:03:36.332 --> 00:03:39.705
it can store a small snippet
of that virus's DNA

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:43.373
for use as a program
to direct the CRISPR scissors

00:03:43.397 --> 00:03:46.933
to cut that viral DNA sequence
during a future infection.

00:03:47.778 --> 00:03:52.691
Cutting a virus's DNA messes up
the function of the cut viral gene,

00:03:52.715 --> 00:03:55.417
and therefore disrupts
the virus's life cycle.

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:02.860
Remarkable researchers including
Emmanuelle Charpentier, George Church,

00:04:02.884 --> 00:04:05.537
Jennifer Doudna and Feng Zhang

00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:09.530
showed six years ago how CRISPR scissors
could be programmed

00:04:09.554 --> 00:04:12.141
to cut DNA sequences of our choosing,

00:04:12.165 --> 00:04:14.534
including sequences in your genome,

00:04:14.558 --> 00:04:17.901
instead of the viral DNA sequences
chosen by bacteria.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.084
But the outcomes are actually similar.

00:04:21.606 --> 00:04:24.074
Cutting a DNA sequence in your genome

00:04:24.098 --> 00:04:28.225
also disrupts the function
of the cut gene, typically,

00:04:28.997 --> 00:04:33.464
by causing the insertion and deletion
of random mixtures of DNA letters

00:04:33.488 --> 00:04:34.641
at the cut site.

00:04:36.625 --> 00:04:40.506
Now, disrupting genes can be very
useful for some applications.

00:04:42.005 --> 00:04:46.306
But for most point mutations
that cause genetic diseases,

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.687
simply cutting the already-mutated gene
won't benefit patients,

00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:54.679
because the function of the mutated gene
needs to be restored,

00:04:54.703 --> 00:04:56.318
not further disrupted.

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.141
So cutting this
already-mutated hemoglobin gene

00:05:00.165 --> 00:05:02.688
that causes sickle cell anemia

00:05:02.712 --> 00:05:06.228
won't restore the ability of patients
to make healthy red blood cells.

00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:11.972
And while we can sometimes introduce
new DNA sequences into cells

00:05:11.996 --> 00:05:15.417
to replace the DNA sequences
surrounding a cut site,

00:05:15.441 --> 00:05:19.765
that process, unfortunately, doesn't work
in most types of cells,

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.230
and the disrupted gene outcomes
still predominate.

00:05:24.297 --> 00:05:26.479
Like many scientists,
I've dreamed of a future

00:05:26.503 --> 00:05:29.277
in which we might be able to treat
or maybe even cure

00:05:29.301 --> 00:05:30.672
human genetic diseases.

00:05:31.135 --> 00:05:34.936
But I saw the lack of a way
to fix point mutations,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.984
which cause most human genetic diseases,

00:05:38.008 --> 00:05:40.396
as a major problem standing in the way.

00:05:41.434 --> 00:05:44.102
Being a chemist, I began
working with my students

00:05:44.126 --> 00:05:49.061
to develop ways on performing chemistry
directly on an individual DNA base,

00:05:49.085 --> 00:05:54.704
to truly fix, rather than disrupt,
the mutations that cause genetic diseases.

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:59.070
The results of our efforts
are molecular machines

00:05:59.094 --> 00:06:00.482
called "base editors."

00:06:01.618 --> 00:06:07.093
Base editors use the programmable
searching mechanism of CRISPR scissors,

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:10.053
but instead of cutting the DNA,

00:06:10.077 --> 00:06:13.018
they directly convert
one base to another base

00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:15.295
without disrupting the rest of the gene.

00:06:16.674 --> 00:06:20.832
So if you think of naturally occurring
CRISPR proteins as molecular scissors,

00:06:20.856 --> 00:06:23.642
you can think of base editors as pencils,

00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:27.162
capable of directly rewriting
one DNA letter into another

00:06:28.098 --> 00:06:31.901
by actually rearranging
the atoms of one DNA base

00:06:31.925 --> 00:06:34.259
to instead become a different base.

00:06:35.513 --> 00:06:37.689
Now, base editors don't exist in nature.

00:06:38.683 --> 00:06:41.913
In fact, we engineered
the first base editor, shown here,

00:06:41.937 --> 00:06:43.294
from three separate proteins

00:06:43.318 --> 00:06:45.548
that don't even come
from the same organism.

00:06:46.151 --> 00:06:51.248
We started by taking CRISPR scissors
and disabling the ability to cut DNA

00:06:51.272 --> 00:06:55.811
while retaining its ability to search for
and bind a target DNA sequence

00:06:55.835 --> 00:06:57.369
in a programmed manner.

00:06:58.351 --> 00:07:01.188
To those disabled CRISPR
scissors, shown in blue,

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:03.720
we attached a second protein in red,

00:07:03.744 --> 00:07:08.045
which performs a chemical reaction
on the DNA base C,

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:11.402
converting it into a base
that behaves like T.

00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:16.100
Third, we had to attach
to the first two proteins

00:07:16.124 --> 00:07:17.474
the protein shown in purple,

00:07:17.498 --> 00:07:21.098
which protects the edited base
from being removed by the cell.

00:07:22.466 --> 00:07:25.308
The net result is an engineered
three-part protein

00:07:25.332 --> 00:07:29.450
that for the first time
allows us to convert Cs into Ts

00:07:29.474 --> 00:07:31.637
at specified locations in the genome.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.522
But even at this point,
our work was only half done.

00:07:36.546 --> 00:07:39.172
Because in order to be stable in cells,

00:07:39.196 --> 00:07:42.855
the two strands of a DNA double helix
have to form base pairs.

00:07:44.125 --> 00:07:47.783
And because C only pairs with G,

00:07:47.807 --> 00:07:50.809
and T only pairs with A,

00:07:51.752 --> 00:07:56.598
simply changing a C to a T
on one DNA strand creates a mismatch,

00:07:56.622 --> 00:07:59.471
a disagreement between the two DNA strands

00:07:59.495 --> 00:08:03.763
that the cell has to resolve
by deciding which strand to replace.

00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:09.490
We realized that we could further engineer
this three-part protein

00:08:10.649 --> 00:08:14.515
to flag the nonedited strand
as the one to be replaced

00:08:14.539 --> 00:08:16.450
by nicking that strand.

00:08:17.276 --> 00:08:19.805
This little nick tricks the cell

00:08:19.829 --> 00:08:24.776
into replacing the nonedited G with an A

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.125
as it remakes the nicked strand,

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:31.180
thereby completing the conversion
of what used to be a C-G base pair

00:08:31.204 --> 00:08:33.500
into a stable T-A base pair.

00:08:36.585 --> 00:08:38.136
After several years of hard work

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.141
led by a former post doc
in the lab, Alexis Komor,

00:08:42.165 --> 00:08:45.347
we succeeded in developing
this first class of base editor,

00:08:45.371 --> 00:08:49.037
which converts Cs into Ts and Gs into As

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:51.220
at targeted positions of our choosing.

00:08:52.633 --> 00:08:57.863
Among the more than 35,000 known
disease-associated point mutations,

00:08:57.887 --> 00:09:01.672
the two kinds of mutations
that this first base editor can reverse

00:09:01.696 --> 00:09:07.839
collectively account for about 14 percent
or 5,000 or so pathogenic point mutations.

00:09:08.593 --> 00:09:13.363
But correcting the largest fraction
of disease-causing point mutations

00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:17.022
would require developing
a second class of base editor,

00:09:17.046 --> 00:09:21.132
one that could convert
As into Gs or Ts into Cs.

00:09:22.846 --> 00:09:26.573
Led by Nicole Gaudelli,
a former post doc in the lab,

00:09:26.597 --> 00:09:29.719
we set out to develop
this second class of base editor,

00:09:29.743 --> 00:09:35.870
which, in theory, could correct up to
almost half of pathogenic point mutations,

00:09:35.894 --> 00:09:39.805
including that mutation that causes
the rapid-aging disease progeria.

00:09:42.107 --> 00:09:45.274
We realized that we could
borrow, once again,

00:09:45.298 --> 00:09:49.366
the targeting mechanism of CRISPR scissors

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:54.551
to bring the new base editor
to the right site in a genome.

00:09:55.543 --> 00:09:58.635
But we quickly encountered
an incredible problem;

00:09:59.896 --> 00:10:02.324
namely, there is no protein

00:10:02.348 --> 00:10:06.400
that's known to convert
A into G or T into C

00:10:06.424 --> 00:10:07.585
in DNA.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.926
Faced with such a serious stumbling block,

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.482
most students would probably
look for another project,

00:10:13.506 --> 00:10:15.246
if not another research advisor.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.434
(Laughter)

00:10:16.458 --> 00:10:18.400
But Nicole agreed to proceed with a plan

00:10:18.424 --> 00:10:21.091
that seemed wildly ambitious at the time.

00:10:21.966 --> 00:10:24.305
Given the absence
of a naturally occurring protein

00:10:24.329 --> 00:10:26.490
that performs the necessary chemistry,

00:10:26.514 --> 00:10:29.950
we decided we would evolve
our own protein in the laboratory

00:10:29.974 --> 00:10:33.809
to convert A into a base
that behaves like G,

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:38.660
starting from a protein
that performs related chemistry on RNA.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:43.164
We set up a Darwinian
survival-of-the-fittest selection system

00:10:43.188 --> 00:10:47.180
that explored tens of millions
of protein variants

00:10:47.204 --> 00:10:49.222
and only allowed those rare variants

00:10:49.246 --> 00:10:52.467
that could perform the necessary
chemistry to survive.

00:10:53.883 --> 00:10:56.271
We ended up with a protein shown here,

00:10:56.295 --> 00:10:59.152
the first that can convert A in DNA

00:10:59.176 --> 00:11:01.268
into a base that resembles G.

00:11:01.292 --> 00:11:02.895
And when we attached that protein

00:11:02.919 --> 00:11:05.490
to the disabled CRISPR
scissors, shown in blue,

00:11:05.514 --> 00:11:07.522
we produced the second base editor,

00:11:07.546 --> 00:11:10.641
which converts As into Gs,

00:11:10.665 --> 00:11:14.506
and then uses the same
strand-nicking strategy

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:16.450
that we used in the first base editor

00:11:16.474 --> 00:11:21.939
to trick the cell into replacing
the nonedited T with a C

00:11:21.963 --> 00:11:23.638
as it remakes that nicked strand,

00:11:23.662 --> 00:11:27.833
thereby completing the conversion
of an A-T base pair to a G-C base pair.

00:11:28.845 --> 00:11:30.892
(Applause)

00:11:30.916 --> 00:11:32.086
Thank you.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:35.467
(Applause)

00:11:35.491 --> 00:11:37.826
As an academic scientist in the US,

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.997
I'm not used to being
interrupted by applause.

00:11:40.021 --> 00:11:43.172
(Laughter)

00:11:43.196 --> 00:11:47.601
We developed these
first two classes of base editors

00:11:47.625 --> 00:11:50.399
only three years ago
and one and a half years ago.

00:11:51.267 --> 00:11:52.815
But even in that short time,

00:11:52.839 --> 00:11:56.561
base editing has become widely used
by the biomedical research community.

00:11:57.776 --> 00:12:02.141
Base editors have been sent
more than 6,000 times

00:12:02.165 --> 00:12:06.036
at the request of more than
1,000 researchers around the globe.

00:12:07.475 --> 00:12:10.991
A hundred scientific research papers
have been published already,

00:12:11.015 --> 00:12:14.743
using base editors in organisms
ranging from bacteria

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:16.901
to plants to mice to primates.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:21.557
While base editors are too new

00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:24.466
to have already entered
human clinical trials,

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:29.612
scientists have succeeded in achieving
a critical milestone towards that goal

00:12:29.636 --> 00:12:32.485
by using base editors in animals

00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:36.418
to correct point mutations
that cause human genetic diseases.

00:12:37.815 --> 00:12:38.966
For example,

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:42.783
a collaborative team of scientists
led by Luke Koblan and Jon Levy,

00:12:42.807 --> 00:12:45.220
two additional students in my lab,

00:12:45.244 --> 00:12:49.363
recently used a virus to deliver
that second base editor

00:12:49.387 --> 00:12:51.577
into a mouse with progeria,

00:12:51.601 --> 00:12:55.458
changing that disease-causing
T back into a C

00:12:55.482 --> 00:12:59.588
and reversing its consequences
at the DNA, RNA and protein levels.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.626
Base editors have also
been used in animals

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.574
to reverse the consequence of tyrosinemia,

00:13:07.642 --> 00:13:11.260
beta thalassemia, muscular dystrophy,

00:13:11.284 --> 00:13:14.974
phenylketonuria, a congenital deafness

00:13:14.998 --> 00:13:16.937
and a type of cardiovascular disease --

00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:21.823
in each case, by directly
correcting a point mutation

00:13:21.847 --> 00:13:24.400
that causes or contributes to the disease.

00:13:25.688 --> 00:13:27.744
In plants, base editors have been used

00:13:27.768 --> 00:13:31.840
to introduce individual
single DNA letter changes

00:13:31.864 --> 00:13:33.832
that could lead to better crops.

00:13:34.253 --> 00:13:38.842
And biologists have used base editors
to probe the role of individual letters

00:13:38.866 --> 00:13:41.683
in genes associated
with diseases such as cancer.

00:13:43.046 --> 00:13:47.613
Two companies I cofounded,
Beam Therapeutics and Pairwise Plants,

00:13:47.637 --> 00:13:51.462
are using base editing
to treat human genetic diseases

00:13:51.486 --> 00:13:53.092
and to improve agriculture.

00:13:53.953 --> 00:13:55.919
All of these applications of base editing

00:13:55.943 --> 00:13:59.037
have taken place in less
than the past three years:

00:13:59.061 --> 00:14:01.425
on the historical timescale of science,

00:14:01.449 --> 00:14:02.731
the blink of an eye.

00:14:04.657 --> 00:14:05.910
Additional work lies ahead

00:14:05.934 --> 00:14:08.966
before base editing can realize
its full potential

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:12.604
to improve the lives of patients
with genetic diseases.

00:14:13.244 --> 00:14:16.024
While many of these diseases
are thought to be treatable

00:14:16.048 --> 00:14:17.897
by correcting the underlying mutation

00:14:17.921 --> 00:14:21.437
in even a modest fraction
of cells in an organ,

00:14:21.461 --> 00:14:24.437
delivering molecular machines
like base editors

00:14:24.461 --> 00:14:26.228
into cells in a human being

00:14:26.252 --> 00:14:27.421
can be challenging.

00:14:28.962 --> 00:14:32.335
Co-opting nature's viruses
to deliver base editors

00:14:32.359 --> 00:14:34.557
instead of the molecules
that give you a cold

00:14:34.581 --> 00:14:37.268
is one of several promising
delivery strategies

00:14:37.292 --> 00:14:38.951
that's been successfully used.

00:14:40.268 --> 00:14:42.633
Continuing to develop
new molecular machines

00:14:42.657 --> 00:14:44.525
that can make all of the remaining ways

00:14:44.549 --> 00:14:47.441
to convert one base pair
to another base pair

00:14:47.465 --> 00:14:51.845
and that minimize unwanted editing
at off-target locations in cells

00:14:51.869 --> 00:14:53.069
is very important.

00:14:53.782 --> 00:14:58.488
And engaging with other scientists,
doctors, ethicists and governments

00:14:58.512 --> 00:15:03.303
to maximize the likelihood
that base editing is applied thoughtfully,

00:15:03.327 --> 00:15:05.708
safely and ethically,

00:15:05.732 --> 00:15:07.732
remains a critical obligation.

00:15:09.525 --> 00:15:11.136
These challenges notwithstanding,

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.815
if you had told me
even just five years ago

00:15:14.839 --> 00:15:16.490
that researchers around the globe

00:15:16.514 --> 00:15:20.053
would be using laboratory-evolved
molecular machines

00:15:20.077 --> 00:15:23.074
to directly convert
an individual base pair

00:15:23.098 --> 00:15:24.280
to another base pair

00:15:24.304 --> 00:15:26.923
at a specified location
in the human genome

00:15:26.947 --> 00:15:30.772
efficiently and with a minimum
of other outcomes,

00:15:30.796 --> 00:15:31.964
I would have asked you,

00:15:31.988 --> 00:15:34.462
"What science-fiction novel
are you reading?"

00:15:35.706 --> 00:15:39.166
Thanks to a relentlessly dedicated
group of students

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:43.650
who were creative enough to engineer
what we could design ourselves

00:15:43.674 --> 00:15:46.599
and brave enough
to evolve what we couldn't,

00:15:46.623 --> 00:15:51.663
base editing has begun to transform
that science-fiction-like aspiration

00:15:51.687 --> 00:15:53.544
into an exciting new reality,

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:57.481
one in which the most important gift
we give our children

00:15:57.505 --> 00:16:00.530
may not only be
three billion letters of DNA,

00:16:00.554 --> 00:16:03.664
but also the means to protect
and repair them.

00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:05.490
Thank you.

00:16:05.514 --> 00:16:10.016
(Applause)

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.190
Thank you.
