00:00:00.128 --> 00:00:01.656
So far, we've spoken about

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.536
all of the wonderful
benefits that sleep provides,

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.040
but how much sleep should
we actually be getting?

00:00:09.064 --> 00:00:11.842
[Sleeping with Science]

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:13.892
(Music)

00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:16.936
For the average adult,
the current recommendation

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.726
is somewhere between seven to nine
hours of sleep a night.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.626
And what we've been finding
from large-scale epidemiological studies

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.446
is that, using that reference point
of seven to nine hours,

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.456
once you start to drop below that,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.146
your mortality risk
actually starts to increase.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.696
In fact, the Center for Disease Control
in the United States, or the CDC,

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.276
they stipulate a minimum
of seven hours of sleep a night

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.486
for the average adult.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.226
In other words, the shorter your sleep,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.726
the shorter your life.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.806
But it turns out that it's not quite
a linear relationship as you would expect.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.956
It's not as though the more
and more that you sleep,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.246
the lower and lower
your mortality risk is.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.786
In fact, something strange happens.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.386
Once you get past nine hours,

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.116
you actually start to see
a rise back up in mortality risk,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.336
which seems rather strange and peculiar.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.836
And scientists have actually put forward
at least two different explanations.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.626
The first is that,
if you look at those studies,

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.896
it may be that individuals are suffering
from significant disease and illness.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.076
When we become infected,
or we have disease,

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.776
typically, we try to sleep longer,
we stay in bed longer.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.958
So in other words,

00:01:36.982 --> 00:01:41.501
it was the unmeasured disease
and sickness in those studies

00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:45.231
that was triggering
a response in those individuals

00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:46.791
to try and sleep more.

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:48.081
That's one explanation.

00:01:48.105 --> 00:01:52.201
The second possible explanation
is poor sleep quality,

00:01:52.225 --> 00:01:54.881
because we know that sleep quality,

00:01:54.905 --> 00:01:58.301
independent of sleep quantity,

00:01:58.325 --> 00:02:01.831
is also associated with mortality risk.

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:04.940
And the lower that your
quality of sleep is,

00:02:04.964 --> 00:02:06.971
the higher your risk of death.

00:02:06.995 --> 00:02:11.751
People who have poor quality of sleep
will typically try to sleep longer;

00:02:11.775 --> 00:02:17.021
they'll try to stay in bed longer
to overcome that poor quality of sleep.

00:02:17.045 --> 00:02:22.531
It may be poor quality of sleep
masquerading as long sleep

00:02:22.555 --> 00:02:25.671
that is associated
with a higher risk of death,

00:02:25.695 --> 00:02:28.221
rather than the long sleep itself.

00:02:28.245 --> 00:02:33.341
But if we take a step back
and think about society overall,

00:02:33.365 --> 00:02:36.841
I think modernity is constantly pushing us

00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:42.111
to, perhaps, work long hours
and therefore neglect our sleep.

00:02:42.135 --> 00:02:46.381
But if we want to be around
long enough to get the benefits

00:02:46.405 --> 00:02:49.611
and the fruits of all of that hard labor,

00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:53.638
we may want to think about starting
to prioritize our sleep some more.
