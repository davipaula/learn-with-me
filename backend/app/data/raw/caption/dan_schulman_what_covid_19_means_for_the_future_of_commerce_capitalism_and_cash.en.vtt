Corey Hajim: Today, our guest
is Dan Schulman, CEO of PayPal.

00:00:17.556 --> 00:00:21.309
When most of us think of PayPal,
we think of buying something online

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.699
or paying a friend back
for a drink using Venmo.

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:29.283
But PayPal has also become
a major financial services player,

00:00:29.307 --> 00:00:32.803
often acting as an alternative
to a traditional bank.

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:35.020
During this pandemic,

00:00:35.044 --> 00:00:40.095
PayPal has supported small businesses
around the world by providing loans,

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:41.437
waiving fees

00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:44.231
and increasing cash back programs.

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:46.258
It has also worked with the US government

00:00:46.282 --> 00:00:48.801
on its Paycheck Protection Program,

00:00:48.825 --> 00:00:52.172
as well as distributing stimulus checks.

00:00:52.196 --> 00:00:56.825
It has enabled an outpouring
of generosity online as well.

00:00:57.776 --> 00:00:59.867
The trend towards digital payments,

00:00:59.891 --> 00:01:03.454
or what we might now want
to think of as "contactless payments,"

00:01:03.478 --> 00:01:05.821
has massively accelerated,

00:01:05.845 --> 00:01:08.901
and it's changing forever
how we think about commerce.

00:01:08.925 --> 00:01:11.677
So I'm really excited
to have Dan here with us.

00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:13.425
Thank you so much, Dan.

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.582
Dan Schulman: Thanks for having me, Corey.
Pleasure to be here with you.

00:01:18.956 --> 00:01:21.050
CH: Glad to see you.

00:01:21.677 --> 00:01:24.326
So let's dive right in.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.987
Within a few months
of this pandemic's arrival,

00:01:28.011 --> 00:01:30.899
more than 30 million people
have filed for unemployment

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:33.147
in the United States alone.

00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:35.879
These are certainly unusual circumstances,

00:01:35.903 --> 00:01:39.647
but it seems clear we were running
very close to the edge,

00:01:39.671 --> 00:01:42.242
and now so many businesses
and their employees

00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:45.554
are facing huge financial challenges.

00:01:45.578 --> 00:01:47.114
How worried are you?

00:01:48.816 --> 00:01:54.199
DS: Well, I think the crisis
has exposed three things.

00:01:54.223 --> 00:01:56.974
Obviously, it's a health crisis

00:01:56.998 --> 00:01:58.998
for so many people.

00:01:59.497 --> 00:02:03.038
Second thing is,
that health crisis has ricocheted,

00:02:03.062 --> 00:02:08.090
and the world is now
in an economic crisis.

00:02:08.114 --> 00:02:10.712
And the third crisis
that we don't talk so much about

00:02:10.736 --> 00:02:12.806
but I think is impacting the way

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.138
that we're going to live
our lives going forward

00:02:16.162 --> 00:02:19.720
is: this is a psychological
crisis as well.

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:24.852
People are reexamining
their place in the world,

00:02:24.876 --> 00:02:26.632
what's happening in the world,

00:02:26.656 --> 00:02:29.241
how they're going to live their lives,

00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:32.001
both in the pandemic and postpandemic.

00:02:32.025 --> 00:02:37.260
And so I think this is something
that each of those phases

00:02:37.284 --> 00:02:39.746
will need to be dealt with.

00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:41.652
But you said this,

00:02:41.676 --> 00:02:44.216
and I completely agree with you:

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.127
there was an economic crisis happening

00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:51.437
well before the pandemic exposed this.

00:02:51.461 --> 00:02:54.268
It's kind of like
the water level came down

00:02:54.292 --> 00:02:57.649
and exposed what was already there.

00:02:57.673 --> 00:03:01.130
You had, for instance, in the US,

00:03:01.154 --> 00:03:06.052
185 million adults in the US

00:03:06.076 --> 00:03:10.109
struggling to make ends meet
at the end of the month.

00:03:10.133 --> 00:03:15.895
You have over 70 million adults that are
really outside of the financial system,

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:21.774
spending over 140 billion dollars
on high interest rates,

00:03:21.798 --> 00:03:24.088
unnecessary fees

00:03:24.112 --> 00:03:25.571
and struggling as well.

00:03:25.595 --> 00:03:30.600
And so I think
what this has really done --

00:03:30.624 --> 00:03:34.981
because you can't ignore 20,
25 percent unemployment rates --

00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:37.398
it's exposed this crisis

00:03:37.422 --> 00:03:42.894
and forced a lot of people into, maybe,
actions that they might not have taken

00:03:42.918 --> 00:03:44.739
without this crisis happening.

00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:48.039
CH: Yeah, I think that's right.

00:03:48.063 --> 00:03:50.709
There are so many challenges
and so many opportunities,

00:03:50.733 --> 00:03:55.425
and I think you've spoken
of this opportunity

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:59.332
of digital transactions
being helpful to people,

00:03:59.356 --> 00:04:02.355
and obviously the trend, as you've said,

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.147
has massively accelerated and pushed us
into this world even further.

00:04:07.171 --> 00:04:08.899
So I'm curious:

00:04:08.923 --> 00:04:12.213
What does the world
look like without cash?

00:04:12.237 --> 00:04:13.407
Or less cash?

00:04:13.431 --> 00:04:15.887
What are the advantages
and what are the challenges

00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:17.623
of making that transition?

00:04:18.892 --> 00:04:24.117
DS: I think some of the trends that are
emerging coming out of this pandemic

00:04:24.141 --> 00:04:27.695
or coming into it
and as we look forward is,

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:34.661
clearly, this has been a discontinuous
change in the trend line

00:04:34.685 --> 00:04:37.882
as we move from physical to digital.

00:04:37.906 --> 00:04:44.439
I think we've accelerated
many forms of digital capabilities

00:04:44.463 --> 00:04:46.959
by three to five years.

00:04:46.983 --> 00:04:50.813
And that can be from digital payments

00:04:50.837 --> 00:04:53.640
to telemedicine

00:04:53.664 --> 00:04:58.372
to really changing the face of retail

00:04:58.396 --> 00:05:00.539
and how we think about retailing,

00:05:00.563 --> 00:05:04.205
changing the face of entertainment,

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.156
even changing the way governments
think about managing and moving money

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.264
and really thinking about
digital currencies going forward.

00:05:13.288 --> 00:05:17.919
And so I think there are
a tremendous number of changes

00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:19.517
that will occur

00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:22.380
during this pandemic and coming out of it.

00:05:22.404 --> 00:05:25.604
Digital payments is obviously
one of the big ones that will happen.

00:05:25.628 --> 00:05:28.922
I mean, cash has been around
for quite some time,

00:05:28.946 --> 00:05:31.056
thousands of years.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.308
I would not be so bold
as to predict its full demise.

00:05:35.332 --> 00:05:38.654
Many people have been wrong doing that.

00:05:38.678 --> 00:05:42.008
But there is no question right now

00:05:42.032 --> 00:05:46.307
that you will see an acceleration
of the demise of cash.

00:05:46.331 --> 00:05:50.610
Last year, you had
over 18 trillion dollars of cash

00:05:50.634 --> 00:05:52.586
spent at retail.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.662
Eighty-five percent
of the world's transactions today

00:05:55.686 --> 00:05:57.890
are done in cash still.

00:05:58.454 --> 00:06:02.590
But the really big change right now

00:06:02.614 --> 00:06:04.283
towards digital payments,

00:06:04.307 --> 00:06:09.888
and that's both the advent
and the acceleration of commerce

00:06:09.912 --> 00:06:11.076
that's happening,

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.363
as well as the shift to in-store
contactless payments, as you said,

00:06:16.387 --> 00:06:21.469
and the real impetus for that
is health reasons.

00:06:21.493 --> 00:06:23.980
People do not want to hand over money.

00:06:24.004 --> 00:06:26.830
They do not want to touch screens.

00:06:26.854 --> 00:06:30.322
They don't want to pick up a pen
and sign at the point of sale.

00:06:30.346 --> 00:06:34.505
And so there is a demand

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:37.901
for contactless payments
and digital payments

00:06:37.925 --> 00:06:42.505
to keep social distancing
requirements in place,

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:44.924
to protect the health of cashiers,

00:06:44.948 --> 00:06:47.688
to protect the health of consumers.

00:06:47.712 --> 00:06:54.387
And I think we are going to see,
we are already seeing in our business,

00:06:54.411 --> 00:06:58.355
a surge in digital payments
across the world.

00:06:59.965 --> 00:07:01.995
CH: It seems like a great opportunity,

00:07:02.019 --> 00:07:06.050
but how do we make sure
that this transition is inclusive?

00:07:06.074 --> 00:07:09.863
I mean, you've talked about
how so many people are underserved

00:07:09.887 --> 00:07:12.583
by the traditional banking industry.

00:07:12.607 --> 00:07:15.216
How do we make sure that those people

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.006
have that opportunity?

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.952
And it feels like a smartphone

00:07:18.976 --> 00:07:21.188
becomes an essential item.

00:07:21.212 --> 00:07:23.192
How do we address that?

00:07:24.158 --> 00:07:25.477
DS: Yeah.

00:07:25.501 --> 00:07:32.380
I do think that a mobile
is really a key to unlocking this.

00:07:32.796 --> 00:07:35.731
I've often said that, really,

00:07:35.755 --> 00:07:40.570
one of the big moon shots
for the financial services industry

00:07:40.594 --> 00:07:43.716
is this idea of not just
financial inclusion.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.285
Most people define financial inclusion

00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:49.777
by somebody having
access to a bank account,

00:07:49.801 --> 00:07:53.166
but just having access to a bank account
is not nearly enough.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.810
I think what we need to aim for

00:07:55.834 --> 00:07:58.405
is how do we think about financial health?

00:07:58.429 --> 00:08:01.585
How do we make sure
that people have the ability

00:08:01.609 --> 00:08:04.832
to have some wherewithal

00:08:04.856 --> 00:08:11.615
to create savings to withstand some kind
of financial shock to the system?

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:15.138
I do think that mobile phones

00:08:15.162 --> 00:08:18.186
will be the way that this occurs

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.163
and will be very inclusive going forward.

00:08:21.187 --> 00:08:26.752
There are going to be something like
six billion smartphones in the world

00:08:26.776 --> 00:08:28.772
over the next several years.

00:08:28.796 --> 00:08:31.956
The cost of a smartphone is plummeting.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.682
I think in India now you can buy
a smartphone for under 25 dollars.

00:08:36.706 --> 00:08:41.529
So you're going to have ubiquity
of smartphones across the world,

00:08:41.553 --> 00:08:46.469
and, in fact, what's very interesting
is, in lower-income populations,

00:08:46.493 --> 00:08:51.975
there is a greater penetration
of smartphones than in higher income

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:56.739
because the smartphone
is the only device that somebody has.

00:08:56.763 --> 00:09:02.266
Higher-income individuals
may have desktops or iPads,

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:03.467
that kind of thing,

00:09:03.491 --> 00:09:05.778
but lower income can afford one device,

00:09:05.802 --> 00:09:07.658
and they choose it to be a smartphone

00:09:07.682 --> 00:09:11.923
because they can get and live their life
through that one device.

00:09:11.947 --> 00:09:14.085
And think about that one device.

00:09:14.109 --> 00:09:18.408
Really, you have all the power
of a bank branch

00:09:18.432 --> 00:09:20.318
in the palm of your hands.

00:09:20.342 --> 00:09:26.492
And when you can start
to create distribution of services,

00:09:26.516 --> 00:09:27.993
financial services,

00:09:28.017 --> 00:09:30.043
through a smartphone,

00:09:30.067 --> 00:09:33.866
you then are able
to manage and move money

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:37.260
in ways that we couldn't do traditionally.

00:09:38.122 --> 00:09:40.034
In the physical world,

00:09:40.058 --> 00:09:41.261
if you get a check,

00:09:41.285 --> 00:09:45.147
you need to then go
to a cash checking place to cash it.

00:09:45.171 --> 00:09:48.019
You stand in line for 30 minutes.

00:09:48.043 --> 00:09:51.556
They then charge you anywhere
between two and five percent

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.742
to just change the format of currency

00:09:55.766 --> 00:09:57.562
from a check to cash.

00:09:57.586 --> 00:09:59.929
And then you have cash
and you want to pay a bill.

00:09:59.953 --> 00:10:01.890
You need to stand in line again

00:10:01.914 --> 00:10:03.174
at a bill pay,

00:10:03.198 --> 00:10:06.078
and then you have to pay maybe 10 dollars

00:10:06.102 --> 00:10:09.445
for an individual bill as a fee.

00:10:09.469 --> 00:10:12.338
If you do that via a smartphone,

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:16.074
I believe that not only do you save
a tremendous amount of time,

00:10:16.098 --> 00:10:18.342
because if you're outside
the financial system,

00:10:18.366 --> 00:10:22.340
managing and moving money
is practically a part-time job

00:10:22.364 --> 00:10:23.590
to go and do that,

00:10:23.614 --> 00:10:27.258
so not only do you save time
and return time to individuals,

00:10:27.282 --> 00:10:30.828
but you can cut the cost of transactions

00:10:30.852 --> 00:10:34.664
by anywhere between 50 and 75 percent.

00:10:34.688 --> 00:10:38.626
And remember that $140 billion
number that I gave you?

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.214
And that's just in the US.

00:10:41.238 --> 00:10:44.061
Imagine if you could cut that in half

00:10:44.085 --> 00:10:48.493
and return that to the most
vulnerable populations

00:10:48.517 --> 00:10:50.226
that need it most.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.402
So I think there's tremendous promise

00:10:53.426 --> 00:10:55.497
in the use of technology

00:10:55.521 --> 00:10:57.808
to help provide both inclusion

00:10:57.832 --> 00:11:01.344
and make sure there aren't
digital haves and have-nots,

00:11:01.368 --> 00:11:04.607
but also to start on this journey
towards financial health.

00:11:06.203 --> 00:11:08.430
CH: Yeah, I think a lot
of people don't realize

00:11:08.454 --> 00:11:11.322
that you don't need a bank
account or even a credit card

00:11:11.346 --> 00:11:14.878
to open a PayPal account,

00:11:14.902 --> 00:11:17.475
which is super-interesting.

00:11:17.499 --> 00:11:20.836
I mean, do you see a time
where traditional banks don't exist

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:25.848
or at least play a much smaller role
in the financial services industry?

00:11:26.392 --> 00:11:29.401
DS: Well, I think the entire
financial services industry

00:11:29.425 --> 00:11:32.306
is evolving right now,

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:36.850
and so I think banks
will always play a role,

00:11:36.874 --> 00:11:41.293
or as far into the future as I can see,

00:11:41.317 --> 00:11:42.602
but it will evolve.

00:11:42.626 --> 00:11:47.172
I mean, think about basic credit cards.

00:11:47.196 --> 00:11:49.209
Today, you think about a credit card,

00:11:49.233 --> 00:11:52.515
and you think about it
predominantly as a form factor,

00:11:52.539 --> 00:11:54.553
something that you pull
out of your pocket.

00:11:54.577 --> 00:11:59.420
Sometimes there's status associated with
what you're pulling out of your pocket,

00:11:59.444 --> 00:12:03.628
depending on the color
of that credit card.

00:12:03.652 --> 00:12:07.596
But really I think those
form factors start to go away

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.791
and become embedded in digital wallets.

00:12:10.815 --> 00:12:14.553
So credit will always
be an important element.

00:12:14.577 --> 00:12:16.639
You know, most people in the world,

00:12:16.663 --> 00:12:23.387
it isn't that their cash outlays
exceed their cash intake.

00:12:23.411 --> 00:12:26.802
It's just that they're not
evenly distributed.

00:12:26.826 --> 00:12:31.057
So there are times where your
cash outflows exceed your cash intake,

00:12:31.081 --> 00:12:36.210
and there, you need some form of credit
to make up that difference.

00:12:36.234 --> 00:12:42.402
And so I think forms of credit
will always be an important element.

00:12:42.426 --> 00:12:47.509
But the way that you extend credit
will change going forward,

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:50.580
the way that you think
about scoring people

00:12:50.604 --> 00:12:53.682
in terms of can they handle credit.

00:12:53.706 --> 00:12:57.531
You know, traditionally,
in more developed countries,

00:12:57.555 --> 00:13:01.927
you use what's called
FICO scores or bureau scores,

00:13:01.951 --> 00:13:06.348
but those ignore so many
of the financial transactions

00:13:06.372 --> 00:13:09.185
that people who are outside
the financial system do,

00:13:09.209 --> 00:13:12.633
like paying rent
or paying their bills on time.

00:13:12.657 --> 00:13:18.841
And with the data and information
and machine learning around that --

00:13:18.865 --> 00:13:21.251
and we need to be careful
that there aren't biases

00:13:21.275 --> 00:13:24.017
built into those algorithms --

00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:27.538
we can start to do things
that could never be done before.

00:13:27.562 --> 00:13:30.118
I'll just give you one quick example.

00:13:30.142 --> 00:13:35.091
We're one of the largest providers
of working capital to small businesses

00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:36.658
in the world.

00:13:36.682 --> 00:13:40.307
We're probably one of the top five
in the United States.

00:13:40.331 --> 00:13:44.166
So we've done over 14, 15 billion dollars

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:47.165
of lending of working capital
to small businesses.

00:13:47.551 --> 00:13:52.483
Seventy percent of that
goes to the 30 percent of counties

00:13:52.507 --> 00:13:56.630
where 10 or more banks
have closed branches.

00:13:56.654 --> 00:13:58.513
And where do banks close branches?

00:13:58.537 --> 00:14:01.384
Banks close branches in neighborhoods

00:14:01.408 --> 00:14:04.873
where the median income
is below the national average,

00:14:04.897 --> 00:14:08.458
which makes sense because
for a branch to be profitable,

00:14:08.482 --> 00:14:11.153
they need a certain amount of deposits

00:14:11.177 --> 00:14:13.230
for that branch to actually be profitable.

00:14:13.254 --> 00:14:15.900
And so, in lower income neighborhoods,

00:14:15.924 --> 00:14:18.063
branches are starting to close.

00:14:18.632 --> 00:14:22.469
So why are 70 percent of our loans
in those lower income neighborhoods?

00:14:22.493 --> 00:14:24.280
It's because we do machine learning.

00:14:24.304 --> 00:14:27.988
We don't even look at FICO scores
or bureau scores.

00:14:28.012 --> 00:14:31.268
We look at a number
of different data elements.

00:14:31.292 --> 00:14:35.226
And so we can lend into
those lower income neighborhoods

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.140
where nobody else can,

00:14:37.164 --> 00:14:39.121
and when we do that,

00:14:39.145 --> 00:14:44.958
the average sale of a small business
goes up by 22 percent.

00:14:44.982 --> 00:14:49.051
And imagine the impact that has
on communities and neighborhoods

00:14:49.075 --> 00:14:51.726
where they can finally get
the working capital

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.731
to expand those small businesses.

00:14:53.755 --> 00:14:55.856
And I think that's a perfect example

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.765
of the promise of what technology
and financial services

00:14:59.789 --> 00:15:01.498
married together can do.

00:15:03.396 --> 00:15:05.626
CH: I think it's so interesting.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.113
I'm curious.

00:15:07.137 --> 00:15:13.411
The tech industry has been criticized
for amassing power over society,

00:15:13.435 --> 00:15:16.678
not that the banking industry
isn't criticized.

00:15:16.702 --> 00:15:21.148
But what do you say about people
who might be worried about

00:15:21.172 --> 00:15:24.775
tech companies taking on
even more influence and control

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:26.771
over what's happening in their lives?

00:15:27.365 --> 00:15:28.944
DS: Yeah.

00:15:28.968 --> 00:15:35.918
Well, I think what's so important
for any company and tech companies

00:15:35.942 --> 00:15:41.698
is to respect the boundaries

00:15:41.722 --> 00:15:45.682
in terms of what consumers expect
from a company that serves them.

00:15:46.505 --> 00:15:53.369
I think the most important brand attribute
that a company can have is trust,

00:15:53.393 --> 00:15:57.261
and trust comes from the understanding

00:15:57.285 --> 00:16:01.217
that a company respects your privacy

00:16:01.241 --> 00:16:05.922
and will not sell
your data or information,

00:16:05.946 --> 00:16:11.865
that it can perform transactions
in a secure manner

00:16:11.889 --> 00:16:15.881
so that your transactions are protected.

00:16:15.905 --> 00:16:19.652
And I think those
are kind of foundational,

00:16:19.676 --> 00:16:23.914
and I think any company
needs to respect that.

00:16:23.938 --> 00:16:28.399
They need to assure that consumers

00:16:28.423 --> 00:16:32.137
have the privacy that they desire

00:16:32.161 --> 00:16:35.572
and the safety and security
that is required

00:16:35.596 --> 00:16:37.260
to serve them the right way.

00:16:38.813 --> 00:16:43.951
CH: And obviously, you've gained
a lot of trust with the US government.

00:16:43.975 --> 00:16:48.022
Maybe we could talk a little bit
about how you've been working with them

00:16:48.046 --> 00:16:52.649
to distribute some money
through the Paycheck Protection Program.

00:16:52.673 --> 00:16:53.850
And I was curious,

00:16:53.874 --> 00:16:57.185
I've been reading about it,
and it sounds like

00:16:57.209 --> 00:17:00.182
30 million-ish small businesses
in the United States

00:17:00.206 --> 00:17:03.241
are able to get those funds,

00:17:03.265 --> 00:17:06.023
but only six million
have received the loans.

00:17:06.047 --> 00:17:07.511
What do you think's happened?

00:17:08.515 --> 00:17:09.709
DS: Yep.

00:17:09.733 --> 00:17:15.298
Well, I think initially, the government --
and I give them a lot of credit --

00:17:15.322 --> 00:17:18.001
they responded quite quickly

00:17:18.025 --> 00:17:22.139
with a 3 trillion dollar stimulus package.

00:17:22.163 --> 00:17:25.042
These are massive numbers
that were happening

00:17:25.066 --> 00:17:28.189
in very condensed time frames.

00:17:28.213 --> 00:17:31.649
We were working with various agencies,

00:17:31.673 --> 00:17:35.572
very closely with the Treasury Department,

00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:40.325
in terms of distribution of the stimulus.

00:17:40.349 --> 00:17:45.767
And they were working literally
night and day on this.

00:17:45.791 --> 00:17:49.337
The Small Business Administration
was working night and day.

00:17:49.361 --> 00:17:51.857
But these are volumes

00:17:51.881 --> 00:17:56.117
that have never been seen before
running through these systems,

00:17:56.141 --> 00:18:00.689
and the first tranche of those loans

00:18:00.713 --> 00:18:01.913
was very difficult.

00:18:01.937 --> 00:18:08.824
There were a lot of technical difficulties
in getting those out to small businesses.

00:18:08.848 --> 00:18:11.921
And that first tranche was not enough,

00:18:11.945 --> 00:18:16.238
and it was quickly used,

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:20.091
and there are still
a host of small businesses

00:18:20.115 --> 00:18:21.910
that needed money.

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:24.214
The second tranche that came out

00:18:24.238 --> 00:18:25.775
is still actually in effect.

00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:27.712
It has not been used up,

00:18:27.736 --> 00:18:30.749
and we are continuing to lend on that.

00:18:30.773 --> 00:18:36.634
We've been able to lend
to some 50,000 small businesses.

00:18:36.658 --> 00:18:39.804
We've lent out about 1.7 billion dollars,

00:18:39.828 --> 00:18:42.824
and our loan size,

00:18:42.848 --> 00:18:44.402
which really I'm proud of,

00:18:44.426 --> 00:18:47.338
is about 31,000 dollars.

00:18:47.362 --> 00:18:51.518
The average that a bank does
is between 100 and 125,000 dollars.

00:18:51.542 --> 00:18:56.558
So we are lending
to these true small businesses

00:18:56.582 --> 00:18:58.725
on Main Street,

00:18:58.749 --> 00:19:04.188
and I'm proud that we've
been able to go do that,

00:19:04.212 --> 00:19:08.288
and I think we should give credit
to the US government

00:19:08.312 --> 00:19:10.512
and governments around the world

00:19:10.536 --> 00:19:13.362
that are taking this quite seriously

00:19:13.386 --> 00:19:17.901
and putting a tremendous amount,
a percentage of their GDP,

00:19:17.925 --> 00:19:21.356
towards the rescue of small businesses

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.998
and towards trying
to take care of consumers

00:19:24.022 --> 00:19:28.801
that find themselves
in really difficult straits right now.

00:19:28.825 --> 00:19:30.237
And we've been trying to,

00:19:30.261 --> 00:19:35.738
instead of people mailing out checks,
which is ridiculous in today's world --

00:19:35.762 --> 00:19:38.853
people aren't living where they think
they're going to be living,

00:19:38.877 --> 00:19:42.478
they're with their parents or with friends
or in a different location,

00:19:42.502 --> 00:19:43.710
and mailing a check

00:19:43.734 --> 00:19:46.678
and then having to take a check
and go somewhere,

00:19:46.702 --> 00:19:49.201
which you can't even go
if you're sheltered in place,

00:19:49.225 --> 00:19:50.389
to cash it,

00:19:50.413 --> 00:19:53.135
doing that electronically
just makes a ton more sense --

00:19:53.159 --> 00:19:55.921
and we've been working
with the IRS and Treasury

00:19:55.945 --> 00:19:59.669
and other government agencies
to distribute that electronically.

00:20:01.429 --> 00:20:03.236
CH: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.312
It's a massive, massive project

00:20:06.336 --> 00:20:08.129
for all of us.

00:20:08.153 --> 00:20:11.454
Whitney is here with some questions
from our community.

00:20:12.052 --> 00:20:13.527
DS: Hello, Whitney.

00:20:13.551 --> 00:20:16.021
Whitney Pennington Rodgers:
Hello Dan. How are you?

00:20:16.045 --> 00:20:18.258
So the community has
some interesting questions

00:20:18.282 --> 00:20:21.481
following up on what you
were talking about earlier about security.

00:20:21.505 --> 00:20:23.183
We have a question from Marc --

00:20:23.207 --> 00:20:26.183
and I apologize in advance
if I mispronounce your name, Marc --

00:20:26.207 --> 00:20:27.385
Marc Vanlerberghe:

00:20:27.409 --> 00:20:29.731
"The move to digital cash
could be one more step

00:20:29.755 --> 00:20:32.032
towards creating the perfect
surveillance state.

00:20:32.056 --> 00:20:33.871
How do we avoid this from happening?"

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:38.073
DS: Yeah, well, this is what
I was talking about, Marc, before.

00:20:38.097 --> 00:20:43.517
I mean, I think this idea of trust

00:20:43.541 --> 00:20:46.302
is incredibly important.

00:20:46.326 --> 00:20:51.106
I think the only companies
that will be successful --

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:55.591
and I think we hold a lot of this
in our own hands as consumers, by the way;

00:20:55.615 --> 00:20:59.190
we need to be aware of data
and information that we're giving

00:20:59.214 --> 00:21:02.159
and to what companies
we're doing that with --

00:21:02.183 --> 00:21:05.676
but I think the companies
that will be successful

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.422
are those that have
a high degree of trust,

00:21:08.446 --> 00:21:12.917
and trust happens
by protecting your privacy

00:21:12.941 --> 00:21:17.915
but also very much assuring
that your transactions in a digital world

00:21:17.939 --> 00:21:19.643
are safe and secure.

00:21:19.667 --> 00:21:23.848
I mean, the idea of cybersecurity

00:21:23.872 --> 00:21:25.551
has always been important,

00:21:25.575 --> 00:21:30.707
but is ever more important
as we move from physical to digital,

00:21:30.731 --> 00:21:34.370
and that's where
large data sets are important,

00:21:34.394 --> 00:21:39.818
because a consumer's identity
is stolen every two seconds.

00:21:39.842 --> 00:21:42.931
Every two seconds, some consumer
has their identity stolen.

00:21:42.955 --> 00:21:45.453
And so we have to be, for instance,

00:21:45.477 --> 00:21:49.666
we have to be sure
that even when you sign in

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:51.885
with your credentials,

00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:54.266
they're actually real credentials.

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:59.827
We have to look at 30 to 100
different elements of that transaction

00:21:59.851 --> 00:22:01.993
to make sure it's really you

00:22:02.017 --> 00:22:04.699
before we let that money
out of your account.

00:22:04.723 --> 00:22:09.755
And so there is a combination
of making sure you have enough data

00:22:09.779 --> 00:22:11.898
to protect somebody

00:22:11.922 --> 00:22:16.780
but also assure that your privacy
is held sacrosanct,

00:22:16.804 --> 00:22:21.939
and I think that is a balancing act
and one that needs to happen

00:22:21.963 --> 00:22:25.039
in order for us to do this successfully.

00:22:26.711 --> 00:22:30.607
WPR: Great, and actually sort of going
from digital cash to digital currency,

00:22:30.631 --> 00:22:34.738
we have another question
from Simone Ross in our community

00:22:34.762 --> 00:22:38.393
about the opportunity that exists
for digital currency.

00:22:38.417 --> 00:22:41.196
She mentioned that PayPal
pulled out of Libra.

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:46.574
What would it take for a truly inclusive
digital currency to take hold here?

00:22:47.398 --> 00:22:48.686
DS: Yeah.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:53.576
I think there is a tremendous
amount of promise

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.562
as we think about digital currencies.

00:22:57.586 --> 00:22:59.925
Our pulling out of Libra

00:22:59.949 --> 00:23:05.724
had nothing to do with our firm conviction

00:23:05.748 --> 00:23:12.747
that blockchain and other forms
of maybe stable coin currencies

00:23:13.918 --> 00:23:15.647
are extremely important

00:23:15.671 --> 00:23:18.188
and can be very, very helpful,

00:23:18.212 --> 00:23:20.258
especially in different
parts of the world.

00:23:20.282 --> 00:23:24.880
As we think about stability
in different parts of the world

00:23:24.904 --> 00:23:28.135
where currencies
can fluctuate up and down,

00:23:28.159 --> 00:23:33.237
to have a more stable currency
where somebody can know,

00:23:33.261 --> 00:23:34.856
if they have that,

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.656
that it's going to be worth x amount,

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.517
and that they can transact,

00:23:38.541 --> 00:23:41.283
either with other individuals
around the world

00:23:41.307 --> 00:23:45.332
or, importantly,
at merchants around the world.

00:23:45.912 --> 00:23:52.846
And we are looking at all forms
of digital currencies right now,

00:23:53.393 --> 00:23:56.327
working hand in hand
with a number of different governments,

00:23:56.351 --> 00:24:02.156
and I think we should all think about
how technology is going to evolve

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.475
and how currencies will evolve
as a result of that.

00:24:05.499 --> 00:24:12.491
And I think this crisis
has really opened the eyes

00:24:12.515 --> 00:24:14.990
of many governments around the world

00:24:15.014 --> 00:24:20.212
as to the need for different tool sets

00:24:20.236 --> 00:24:21.749
to create stimulus

00:24:21.773 --> 00:24:27.864
and to efficiently and quickly
and effectively distribute funds

00:24:27.888 --> 00:24:29.682
to their citizens.

00:24:31.466 --> 00:24:34.245
WPR: Great. Well, I'll be back shortly
with more questions,

00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:37.477
and I'd just love to remind the community
that you can ask questions

00:24:37.501 --> 00:24:38.952
on the "Ask question" feature.

00:24:38.976 --> 00:24:41.556
Be sure to use the pull-down tab
to select Episode 2,

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.731
so those questions come.

00:24:42.755 --> 00:24:43.906
Thank you.

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:45.303
DS: Thanks, Whitney.

00:24:45.327 --> 00:24:47.422
CH: Thanks, Whitney.

00:24:47.446 --> 00:24:50.889
Dan, I want to go back to something
we touched on in the beginning

00:24:50.913 --> 00:24:53.498
about financial wellness.

00:24:53.994 --> 00:24:56.070
PayPal has done something unique

00:24:56.094 --> 00:25:01.632
in terms of calculating
how much to pay people

00:25:01.656 --> 00:25:04.430
and how much you should spend on benefits.

00:25:04.454 --> 00:25:06.666
Traditionally, wages
are set by the market,

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:10.572
but you've found that paying
as much or even more than other companies

00:25:10.596 --> 00:25:11.785
wasn't always enough.

00:25:11.809 --> 00:25:13.742
Can you tell us about that moment?

00:25:15.221 --> 00:25:16.625
DS: Yeah.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:23.088
So I said, kind of, in our opening,
in one of my opening statements,

00:25:23.112 --> 00:25:28.567
that two-thirds of Americans
struggle to make ends meet

00:25:28.591 --> 00:25:30.853
at the end of the month.

00:25:31.546 --> 00:25:36.350
They are financially stressed,

00:25:36.374 --> 00:25:39.552
and it kind of wreaks havoc in their life.

00:25:40.146 --> 00:25:46.082
I did a study to look at PayPal employees.

00:25:46.106 --> 00:25:48.680
We did a research study,

00:25:48.704 --> 00:25:52.404
and I did it because I thought I was going
to get back this great information

00:25:52.428 --> 00:25:55.943
that I was going to talk about
at an employee meeting

00:25:55.967 --> 00:25:57.242
about how well we pay,

00:25:57.266 --> 00:25:59.691
because we pay, to your point,

00:25:59.715 --> 00:26:01.637
at or above market

00:26:01.661 --> 00:26:04.423
in every single location around the world.

00:26:05.228 --> 00:26:10.039
And what I found is, unfortunately,
like the rest of the world,

00:26:10.063 --> 00:26:13.268
even though we paid at market
or above market,

00:26:13.292 --> 00:26:18.221
60 percent of our operations personnel,

00:26:18.245 --> 00:26:21.656
our entry-level employees,
our hourly workers,

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:22.853
face the same thing.

00:26:22.877 --> 00:26:24.793
They struggle to make ends meet.

00:26:24.817 --> 00:26:28.007
And that was simply unacceptable for me.

00:26:28.031 --> 00:26:32.458
I think the world is changing

00:26:32.482 --> 00:26:35.836
in terms of the responsibility
of corporations,

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.858
the responsibility of CEOs.

00:26:38.882 --> 00:26:43.317
We have a lot of different stakeholders
that we try to satisfy,

00:26:43.341 --> 00:26:48.223
from regulators to shareholders
to customers to employees.

00:26:48.247 --> 00:26:52.401
But I think the number one
responsibility that we have

00:26:52.425 --> 00:26:56.147
is the health -- financial health --
of our employees,

00:26:56.171 --> 00:26:59.833
because nothing could be
more important to a company

00:26:59.857 --> 00:27:05.077
than to have financially secure,
passionate employees working for you,

00:27:05.101 --> 00:27:08.291
because nobody is going to serve customers

00:27:08.315 --> 00:27:12.385
better than employees
who feel a part of something

00:27:12.409 --> 00:27:16.855
and feel financially secure and glad
to be a part of that company.

00:27:16.879 --> 00:27:21.331
And so then the real question becomes:
How do you measure that?

00:27:21.355 --> 00:27:25.260
Because a lot of people think
about living wages or a minimum wage.

00:27:25.284 --> 00:27:28.444
And we thought that was insufficient,

00:27:28.468 --> 00:27:33.967
and we came up with a measurement
we called "net disposable income,"

00:27:33.991 --> 00:27:35.158
which is, basically:

00:27:35.182 --> 00:27:41.190
After you pay taxes and
your basically essential living expenses,

00:27:41.214 --> 00:27:47.088
how much money do you have
left over for discretionary things

00:27:47.112 --> 00:27:48.899
or to save?

00:27:48.923 --> 00:27:52.197
And here's the really unfortunate thing --
and I'm not proud of this,

00:27:52.221 --> 00:27:54.866
but remember, we were paying
at market or above,

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:59.237
so I thought the market would
take care of this, right, by doing that --

00:27:59.261 --> 00:28:02.734
we found that for that population,

00:28:02.758 --> 00:28:07.658
they had four to six percent
NDI, net disposable income,

00:28:07.682 --> 00:28:11.343
after paying taxes
and essential living expenses.

00:28:11.367 --> 00:28:12.531
That is not enough.

00:28:12.555 --> 00:28:15.234
You are going to struggle
to make ends meet.

00:28:15.258 --> 00:28:19.423
And by the way, NDI changes
location to location to location

00:28:19.447 --> 00:28:20.949
around the globe, right?

00:28:20.973 --> 00:28:26.377
There's a different NDI in Manila,
a different NDI in Omaha, Nebraska,

00:28:26.401 --> 00:28:29.307
than there is in New York City, etc.

00:28:29.331 --> 00:28:32.855
And so we basically
said to ourselves,

00:28:32.879 --> 00:28:37.207
we need to take
NDI to 20 percent.

00:28:37.231 --> 00:28:39.104
Because at 20 percent --

00:28:39.128 --> 00:28:42.642
and that's a huge shift,
from four to six to 20 percent --

00:28:42.666 --> 00:28:48.859
but at 20 percent,
you actually have the ability to save

00:28:48.883 --> 00:28:53.715
and to put money away and to take care
of discretionary expenses.

00:28:53.739 --> 00:28:59.355
And so we did a pretty
massive reorientation

00:28:59.379 --> 00:29:01.580
of our compensation systems.

00:29:02.268 --> 00:29:08.296
We lowered the cost
of benefits by 58 percent,

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.605
because benefits
are like a regressive tax,

00:29:11.629 --> 00:29:14.683
you pay the same amount
no matter what your salary is.

00:29:14.707 --> 00:29:19.382
And so we had a lot of employees
who weren't taking health care benefits,

00:29:19.406 --> 00:29:21.768
because it cost too much
to be able to do that.

00:29:21.792 --> 00:29:24.366
So we lowered it by 58 percent.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:28.476
We made every single employee
of PayPal a shareholder

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.512
and an owner of the business,

00:29:30.536 --> 00:29:32.842
and we gave them pretty big grants

00:29:32.866 --> 00:29:38.123
so that they could be a part
of the success of PayPal going forward.

00:29:38.147 --> 00:29:41.520
We raised salaries where we needed
to go and do that.

00:29:41.544 --> 00:29:45.177
And then we wrapped all of that
into a financial education program,

00:29:45.201 --> 00:29:48.383
because people had never
gotten equity before,

00:29:48.407 --> 00:29:50.056
they were trying to think through,

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:54.404
"How do I save now that I've got
incremental dollars to go and do that?"

00:29:54.428 --> 00:30:01.055
And that cost us quite a bit
of money to go and do that,

00:30:01.079 --> 00:30:02.604
but I really feel,

00:30:02.628 --> 00:30:05.958
just like how we spend a lot of money
to take care of customers,

00:30:05.982 --> 00:30:09.598
as you mentioned up front, in COVID-19,

00:30:09.622 --> 00:30:15.942
that companies need to stand
for more than just making money,

00:30:15.966 --> 00:30:20.301
for more than just maximizing
our profits next quarter.

00:30:20.325 --> 00:30:24.027
I firmly, firmly believe

00:30:24.051 --> 00:30:28.013
that the costs associated
with taking care of our employees,

00:30:28.037 --> 00:30:30.216
taking care of our customers,

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.953
will benefit us in the long run

00:30:32.977 --> 00:30:36.113
multiplefold over the costs
associated with doing that.

00:30:36.137 --> 00:30:41.347
And we're already beginning
to see some of the impact of that.

00:30:41.371 --> 00:30:48.354
And so, I think every CEO, every company,

00:30:48.378 --> 00:30:51.371
needs to really now start to think about,

00:30:51.395 --> 00:30:54.436
especially maybe
as a result of this crisis,

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:57.378
but as I mentioned,
we had a crisis before this,

00:30:57.402 --> 00:31:01.632
how do we put our employees first,
take care of them?

00:31:01.656 --> 00:31:04.641
Because if you do that,
you'll take care of customers,

00:31:04.665 --> 00:31:06.293
and if you take care of customers,

00:31:06.317 --> 00:31:08.495
you'll take care of
shareholders, inevitably.

00:31:08.495 --> 00:31:14.288
And so this has been a huge part of it

00:31:14.312 --> 00:31:16.385
about for the last year or so.

00:31:18.457 --> 00:31:19.747
CH: It's so interesting,

00:31:19.771 --> 00:31:22.759
and it brings up
so many questions, I think,

00:31:22.783 --> 00:31:25.468
for me and probably our community as well.

00:31:25.492 --> 00:31:31.350
I mean, PayPal is a hugely
profitable tech business,

00:31:31.374 --> 00:31:35.074
huge free cash flow and big margins.

00:31:35.098 --> 00:31:38.374
Do you think this model is something
that every company can do,

00:31:38.398 --> 00:31:45.379
whether it's a tech company,
a manufacture, a meatpacking business?

00:31:45.403 --> 00:31:48.798
I mean, is this what everyone
should be focused on?

00:31:49.861 --> 00:31:54.582
DS: Well, I think that --
and I don't want to moralize

00:31:54.606 --> 00:31:58.526
or tell other companies
what they should do --

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:02.831
but to me, I think
everyone should understand

00:32:02.855 --> 00:32:05.167
the financial health of their employees.

00:32:05.191 --> 00:32:08.237
That's a baseline thing to go do.

00:32:08.261 --> 00:32:10.691
What you do post-that

00:32:10.715 --> 00:32:16.563
is up to maybe your
financial strength as a company

00:32:16.587 --> 00:32:21.071
or where you put your order of priorities.

00:32:21.095 --> 00:32:23.087
But what I've found is,

00:32:24.093 --> 00:32:27.722
I thought the market could tell you that,

00:32:27.746 --> 00:32:31.641
and this is why I say, in many ways --

00:32:31.665 --> 00:32:33.845
you know, I'm a big believer
in capitalism.

00:32:33.869 --> 00:32:37.747
I think it's, in many ways,

00:32:37.771 --> 00:32:41.776
the best economic system
that I know of.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.989
But, like everything, it needs an upgrade.

00:32:44.013 --> 00:32:46.571
It needs tuning,

00:32:46.595 --> 00:32:51.249
and at least for
these vulnerable populations,

00:32:51.273 --> 00:32:54.018
just because you pay at market

00:32:54.042 --> 00:32:58.455
doesn't mean that they have
financial health or financial wellness.

00:32:58.479 --> 00:33:02.975
And I think everyone should know

00:33:02.999 --> 00:33:07.275
whether or not their employees have
the wherewithal to be able to save

00:33:07.299 --> 00:33:09.947
to withstand financial shocks,

00:33:09.971 --> 00:33:14.417
and then really understand, like,
what can you do about it?

00:33:14.441 --> 00:33:17.249
I think this NDI measure

00:33:17.273 --> 00:33:19.125
is a really interesting one.

00:33:19.149 --> 00:33:20.971
It takes some time to go do it,

00:33:20.995 --> 00:33:23.700
because you have to be quite thorough

00:33:23.724 --> 00:33:29.206
and you have to really understand
living expenses by location

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:32.445
and what tax jurisdictions there are.

00:33:32.469 --> 00:33:36.652
But you need to create an NDI

00:33:36.676 --> 00:33:38.826
that's to a certain level

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:41.210
where people aren't struggling
to make ends meet.

00:33:41.234 --> 00:33:43.639
Because if people are struggling
to make ends meet,

00:33:43.663 --> 00:33:45.448
they are not as productive at work.

00:33:45.472 --> 00:33:48.521
They're worried about, like,
what am I going to do with my kids?

00:33:48.545 --> 00:33:51.104
My kid just got sick.
I don't have health insurance.

00:33:51.128 --> 00:33:54.362
I think there's a spiral that occurs.

00:33:54.386 --> 00:33:56.953
You think you're actually saving money

00:33:56.977 --> 00:33:58.502
by paying less,

00:33:58.526 --> 00:34:00.574
but the reality is,

00:34:00.598 --> 00:34:03.020
at least in my belief system,

00:34:03.044 --> 00:34:05.489
you take care of your employees,

00:34:05.513 --> 00:34:08.712
and other things naturally flow from that.

00:34:08.736 --> 00:34:11.123
They are more productive.

00:34:11.147 --> 00:34:15.115
They love being a part of that company.

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:17.301
They take care of customers better.

00:34:17.325 --> 00:34:19.355
And all of those things

00:34:19.379 --> 00:34:24.593
inevitably accrue
to the benefit of a company

00:34:24.617 --> 00:34:28.070
in terms of how it's trying
to serve its ultimate end market.

00:34:28.094 --> 00:34:30.465
But it starts with your employees.

00:34:31.896 --> 00:34:37.114
CH: So obviously you believe
in this "capitalism needs an upgrade,"

00:34:37.138 --> 00:34:41.108
and I think NDI is something
so many companies should adopt.

00:34:41.132 --> 00:34:46.482
But do you think this happens
through benevolent corporate activity?

00:34:46.506 --> 00:34:49.180
I'm channeling my inner Bernie Bro here,

00:34:49.204 --> 00:34:51.367
but I think a lot of people
would be skeptical

00:34:51.391 --> 00:34:55.091
that we should trust companies
to do better at this point.

00:34:55.115 --> 00:34:59.242
Should the government step in
to raise minimum wages,

00:34:59.266 --> 00:35:02.501
do other things to protect workers
in a more structured way?

00:35:04.001 --> 00:35:08.394
DS: Look, I think the government
clearly has a role to play,

00:35:08.418 --> 00:35:13.412
and I think the private and public sectors

00:35:13.436 --> 00:35:16.413
need to work closer together

00:35:16.437 --> 00:35:20.865
to address so many of the issues

00:35:20.889 --> 00:35:25.902
that we face in our societies
across the world,

00:35:25.926 --> 00:35:29.234
whether that be income inequality,

00:35:29.258 --> 00:35:32.498
environmental issues,

00:35:32.522 --> 00:35:34.182
health,

00:35:34.206 --> 00:35:35.993
protections, that kind of thing,

00:35:36.017 --> 00:35:37.852
privacy.

00:35:38.504 --> 00:35:43.976
But the way that I think about this is,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.080
it's very difficult for governments
to regulate around this,

00:35:47.104 --> 00:35:50.765
because there are so many
different ways of thinking about it.

00:35:51.775 --> 00:35:55.212
If I were another CEO,

00:35:55.236 --> 00:35:56.634
and this is like,

00:35:56.658 --> 00:36:00.342
it's actually in your best interest

00:36:00.366 --> 00:36:02.241
to go and do this

00:36:02.265 --> 00:36:05.099
because it's a competitive advantage.

00:36:05.123 --> 00:36:08.744
Like, we attract, I think,

00:36:08.768 --> 00:36:12.507
some of the best talent in the world

00:36:12.531 --> 00:36:14.410
to PayPal,

00:36:14.434 --> 00:36:17.329
because we have a mission
that people believe in,

00:36:17.353 --> 00:36:20.701
that we actually are trying to make
some sort of positive difference.

00:36:20.725 --> 00:36:23.637
I'm not saying we're
the be-all and end-all,

00:36:23.661 --> 00:36:26.796
but I don't think people
should shirk their responsibilities

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.676
of at least making a small difference

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.145
going forward.

00:36:31.169 --> 00:36:34.244
If enough companies did that,
if enough governments did that,

00:36:34.268 --> 00:36:36.391
it would make a real difference

00:36:36.415 --> 00:36:37.849
in the world.

00:36:37.873 --> 00:36:39.439
And then the second thing is,

00:36:39.463 --> 00:36:41.852
you have to have values that support that.

00:36:41.876 --> 00:36:43.978
And those values are incredibly important.

00:36:44.002 --> 00:36:46.900
Those values should be
all about inclusion.

00:36:46.924 --> 00:36:50.371
They should be about
having a diverse workforce.

00:36:50.395 --> 00:36:53.650
They should be about financial wellness.

00:36:53.674 --> 00:36:55.606
And when you do that,

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:58.256
and you attract the very best talent,

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.526
then by definition,

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:06.043
I think the single biggest
competitive advantage for any company

00:37:06.067 --> 00:37:07.912
is their workforce.

00:37:07.936 --> 00:37:11.083
Strategies are great.

00:37:11.107 --> 00:37:12.845
A whole number of things are great.

00:37:12.869 --> 00:37:14.936
You have a great workforce

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.988
that's passionate about what they're doing

00:37:17.012 --> 00:37:18.610
and is financially secure,

00:37:18.634 --> 00:37:21.034
and they will do amazing things.

00:37:21.058 --> 00:37:24.439
And I think it's that kind
of competitive advantage

00:37:24.463 --> 00:37:26.388
that will spur companies.

00:37:26.412 --> 00:37:28.590
So there needs to be

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:35.145
a set of CEOs and companies

00:37:35.169 --> 00:37:37.096
that start to move in this direction,

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:41.885
and I believe you're beginning
to see more do this.

00:37:41.909 --> 00:37:43.415
And once that happens,

00:37:43.439 --> 00:37:45.320
it starts to tip everything,

00:37:45.344 --> 00:37:48.753
and I think more and more need to do it

00:37:48.777 --> 00:37:51.942
to maintain their competitive positioning.

00:37:51.966 --> 00:37:56.428
And that may seem like a self-serving way
why people are doing it,

00:37:56.452 --> 00:37:57.936
but honestly,

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:01.460
I don't care whether they're doing
it out of the goodness of their heart

00:38:01.484 --> 00:38:04.926
or they're doing it
because it's competitively a disadvantage

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:06.315
if they don't.

00:38:06.339 --> 00:38:11.061
Creating financial health
for our employees is the goal,

00:38:11.085 --> 00:38:12.720
and we've got to get that done.

00:38:14.839 --> 00:38:20.066
CH: Yeah. I mean, it sounds like
you think of this as a win-win,

00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:25.690
but it also sounds like you're willing
to maybe think about your employees first

00:38:25.714 --> 00:38:28.983
and sell it to your shareholders later.

00:38:29.007 --> 00:38:32.270
Whitney is -- oh sorry, go ahead.

00:38:32.294 --> 00:38:34.334
DS: No, no, no -- I was just going to say,

00:38:34.358 --> 00:38:36.207
I actually do believe that,

00:38:36.231 --> 00:38:43.217
and I think the idea
of a multistakeholder capitalism,

00:38:43.241 --> 00:38:45.752
that is a time for today,

00:38:45.776 --> 00:38:51.529
and we cannot just think

00:38:51.553 --> 00:38:54.926
that we have one stakeholder
that we need to satisfy.

00:38:54.950 --> 00:39:00.646
We live in our communities,
we live in this world.

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:03.907
To have people struggling
day in and day out

00:39:03.931 --> 00:39:08.272
is not good for any company, and ...

00:39:08.296 --> 00:39:10.069
We can only do x amount,

00:39:10.093 --> 00:39:14.833
but we can actually create
financial health for our employees,

00:39:14.857 --> 00:39:16.063
and we should.

00:39:17.987 --> 00:39:21.323
WPR: Great. So we have so many questions
coming in from the community.

00:39:21.347 --> 00:39:23.691
One here is from Lara Pearson,

00:39:23.715 --> 00:39:27.167
basically about whether PayPal
would consider become a B Corporation.

00:39:27.191 --> 00:39:29.243
"Are you familiar with
the B Corp movement,

00:39:29.267 --> 00:39:32.861
environmentally and socially responsible,
multiple-bottom-line for profits?

00:39:32.885 --> 00:39:35.571
Presuming so, has PayPal considered
or would it consider

00:39:35.595 --> 00:39:37.467
becoming a certified B Corporation?"

00:39:38.073 --> 00:39:41.433
DS: Yep. I'm familiar with B Corp.

00:39:41.457 --> 00:39:44.491
We have no intention to move

00:39:44.515 --> 00:39:47.695
to becoming a B Corporation.

00:39:47.719 --> 00:39:53.464
I think the values
and what we are trying to do

00:39:53.488 --> 00:39:58.812
are very aligned with assuring
a multistakeholder point of view,

00:39:58.836 --> 00:40:01.534
but what I really want

00:40:01.558 --> 00:40:03.344
is for this to be a movement

00:40:03.368 --> 00:40:10.282
across major corporations
across the world.

00:40:10.306 --> 00:40:13.421
And you're not going to have
major corporations around the world

00:40:13.445 --> 00:40:15.258
moving into B Corp.

00:40:15.282 --> 00:40:21.824
There's a lot of other
side issues involved

00:40:21.848 --> 00:40:23.561
with being a B Corporation

00:40:23.585 --> 00:40:28.088
as opposed to just
a publicly listed company,

00:40:28.112 --> 00:40:33.074
and so that's going to be
a long way before that happens.

00:40:33.098 --> 00:40:36.455
And so what I'm
really trying to do is

00:40:36.479 --> 00:40:41.842
encourage and demonstrate

00:40:41.866 --> 00:40:44.547
that being multistakeholder,

00:40:44.571 --> 00:40:46.650
that putting employees first,

00:40:46.674 --> 00:40:49.165
creates competitive advantage.

00:40:49.189 --> 00:40:56.108
And I think I'm not the only CEO
who's feeling that, by the way.

00:40:56.132 --> 00:40:59.688
I think people like Satya Nadella
from Microsoft are doing a great job,

00:40:59.712 --> 00:41:04.741
Marc Benioff from Salesforce.

00:41:04.765 --> 00:41:08.115
I could go through quite a list of names.

00:41:08.139 --> 00:41:10.752
But the list is not long enough yet,

00:41:10.776 --> 00:41:16.190
but I think there's some
quite important names

00:41:16.214 --> 00:41:17.781
and individuals around the world

00:41:17.805 --> 00:41:24.418
who are now talking about
multistakeholder capitalism,

00:41:24.442 --> 00:41:28.914
and I think that's an important element
as we think about our economies

00:41:28.938 --> 00:41:32.742
and way of life looking forward.

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:39.208
WPR: And there was so much interest also
in your net disposable income program

00:41:39.232 --> 00:41:40.964
and a lot of questions around that,

00:41:40.988 --> 00:41:44.562
and one which I think is
along these same lines from Juan Enriquez

00:41:44.586 --> 00:41:47.968
asking about a rational way
to address extreme income disparities.

00:41:47.992 --> 00:41:50.885
And perhaps you could expand
beyond this program,

00:41:50.909 --> 00:41:53.552
just sort of ways
that we might think about this

00:41:53.576 --> 00:41:56.223
in a smarter way moving forward.

00:41:57.386 --> 00:42:00.374
DS: Yeah.

00:42:02.052 --> 00:42:08.876
Well, there's no easy solution,
or it would have been done.

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:12.098
So I think there are a couple things
that I think about

00:42:12.122 --> 00:42:16.124
that may not fully address
extreme income disparities.

00:42:16.148 --> 00:42:23.011
Again, I try to think pragmatically
about these things,

00:42:23.035 --> 00:42:26.890
and, like, what can we really do
to start to address this?

00:42:26.914 --> 00:42:28.602
And again, I think about,

00:42:28.626 --> 00:42:31.648
if we could take one step
and then another step,

00:42:31.672 --> 00:42:34.757
then you're starting your journey,

00:42:34.781 --> 00:42:41.177
and without getting overwhelmed
by how far away the end state is.

00:42:41.201 --> 00:42:44.990
So one, I think companies
need to take care of their employees,

00:42:45.014 --> 00:42:47.755
and I think that will
immediately help to address

00:42:47.779 --> 00:42:50.139
some of these income disparities.

00:42:50.163 --> 00:42:54.763
Number two, I do think that,

00:42:54.787 --> 00:43:01.771
ironically, if you have less money,

00:43:01.795 --> 00:43:05.763
it costs you more to manage and move it,

00:43:05.787 --> 00:43:09.249
which, think about that:

00:43:09.273 --> 00:43:12.358
the less money you have,
if you're outside the financial system,

00:43:12.382 --> 00:43:16.164
the more you spend to manage
and move your money.

00:43:16.188 --> 00:43:22.323
And I think that technology

00:43:22.347 --> 00:43:26.009
is at least a foundational way
for us to think about

00:43:26.033 --> 00:43:31.927
how do we cut the basic costs
of managing and moving money

00:43:31.951 --> 00:43:33.696
by 50 to 70 percent,

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.743
like [check-cashing],

00:43:35.767 --> 00:43:37.459
sending remittances,

00:43:37.483 --> 00:43:43.260
which are such a huge,
important part of the world's economy.

00:43:43.284 --> 00:43:45.908
You know, you do it a traditional way,

00:43:45.932 --> 00:43:48.439
you go into a store

00:43:48.463 --> 00:43:52.034
and send the remittance to another store
and somebody goes and picks it up.

00:43:52.058 --> 00:43:54.375
First of all, incredibly time-consuming,

00:43:54.399 --> 00:43:57.450
and it can cost between
eight and 12 percent

00:43:57.474 --> 00:44:00.224
of that remittance amount
that you're sending.

00:44:00.248 --> 00:44:02.334
So if you're sending a hundred dollars,

00:44:02.358 --> 00:44:05.601
the recipient who so desperately needs it

00:44:05.625 --> 00:44:08.344
is getting 88 to 90 dollars.

00:44:08.368 --> 00:44:12.714
If you do that electronically,
digital wallet to digital wallet,

00:44:12.738 --> 00:44:14.636
that can be like three percent,

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:17.234
so you can get 97 dollars from that.

00:44:17.258 --> 00:44:23.742
And so I think there are ways
of addressing the costs.

00:44:23.766 --> 00:44:25.026
As I mentioned,

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:30.074
there is so much money
spent on unnecessary fees

00:44:30.098 --> 00:44:31.654
and high interest rates,

00:44:31.678 --> 00:44:34.941
and if we can drop that
by 20 percent, 30 percent,

00:44:34.965 --> 00:44:39.875
the amount of money we can return
to vulnerable populations is quite large

00:44:39.899 --> 00:44:42.052
and will start to make a difference.

00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:44.574
WPR: That's great.

00:44:44.598 --> 00:44:46.699
We have a ton of questions
from the audience,

00:44:46.723 --> 00:44:49.293
just one more before we turn things
back over to Corey

00:44:49.317 --> 00:44:50.622
with her final questions.

00:44:50.646 --> 00:44:52.085
This one is from Anna Tunkel,

00:44:52.109 --> 00:44:56.297
which is just, I think, as we are rounding
to the end of the interview here,

00:44:56.321 --> 00:44:58.887
"What are you most optimistic about,

00:44:58.911 --> 00:45:01.929
and what do you see
as the biggest opportunities

00:45:01.953 --> 00:45:04.242
for 'Building Back Better' after COVID?"

00:45:06.282 --> 00:45:07.442
DS: Well, I mean,

00:45:07.466 --> 00:45:12.221
one thing I'm actually optimistic about --

00:45:12.245 --> 00:45:17.880
and I've always been a believer
in the human spirit

00:45:17.904 --> 00:45:24.011
and the power of an individual
to make a difference.

00:45:24.965 --> 00:45:29.348
I know that sounds very cliché,
but I truly believe it,

00:45:29.372 --> 00:45:31.734
and I think every one of us
can make a difference.

00:45:31.758 --> 00:45:33.116
But here's what I'm seeing.

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:37.232
I'm beginning to see that
at a much larger scale

00:45:37.256 --> 00:45:38.836
than I've ever seen before.

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:40.677
You know, we have different platforms,

00:45:40.701 --> 00:45:43.037
either the PayPal platform
or the Venmo platform,

00:45:43.061 --> 00:45:46.769
Venmo here in the US,
PayPal across the world.

00:45:46.793 --> 00:45:52.054
The amount of giving that's happening
through those platforms,

00:45:52.078 --> 00:45:54.532
whether it be to local businesses,

00:45:54.556 --> 00:45:57.934
to artists, to musicians,

00:45:57.958 --> 00:45:59.807
to bartenders,

00:45:59.831 --> 00:46:03.417
to places of worship, to schools,

00:46:03.441 --> 00:46:06.405
to NGOs, to charities

00:46:06.429 --> 00:46:09.864
has exploded on the platform, exploded.

00:46:09.888 --> 00:46:14.745
We have helped to raise
on the PayPal platform

00:46:14.769 --> 00:46:17.244
since COVID-19 struck

00:46:17.268 --> 00:46:22.542
2.8 billion dollars
for NGOs and charities --

00:46:22.566 --> 00:46:23.966
2.8 billion.

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:26.137
That's incredible,

00:46:26.161 --> 00:46:29.515
the amount of generosity
that is pouring out

00:46:29.539 --> 00:46:32.129
from the global community around this.

00:46:32.153 --> 00:46:38.502
And we're just seeing people
randomly pay it forward.

00:46:38.526 --> 00:46:42.651
Somebody gives 20 dollars to a bartender,

00:46:42.675 --> 00:46:44.963
and that bartender takes
10 dollars of that

00:46:44.987 --> 00:46:46.619
and gives it to somebody else.

00:46:46.643 --> 00:46:50.687
And we're watching that over our platform,

00:46:50.711 --> 00:46:54.050
and that gives me a sense of optimism.

00:46:54.074 --> 00:46:59.082
I also feel like this period of time

00:46:59.106 --> 00:47:03.481
has exposed a number of things
that were happening

00:47:03.505 --> 00:47:05.223
but were invisible,

00:47:05.247 --> 00:47:08.688
and I think when things become visible,

00:47:08.712 --> 00:47:11.239
that's when you can start to address them,

00:47:11.263 --> 00:47:13.781
and I think there's a lot of attention

00:47:13.805 --> 00:47:18.801
on some issues that
should have had attention before,

00:47:18.825 --> 00:47:23.199
but vulnerable populations
don't have as loud a voice as others,

00:47:23.223 --> 00:47:28.914
and now that voice is being heard,
because you can't ignore it.

00:47:28.938 --> 00:47:33.889
And hopefully, that will create progress

00:47:33.913 --> 00:47:37.114
against some of these
structural inequalities

00:47:37.138 --> 00:47:40.142
that have been there for a long time.

00:47:42.768 --> 00:47:44.571
WPR: That's wonderful.

00:47:44.595 --> 00:47:47.212
And there's so much interest online.

00:47:47.236 --> 00:47:51.599
You have some other questions
to ask as well.

00:47:51.623 --> 00:47:54.475
CH: So I think we have one more
from our community

00:47:54.499 --> 00:47:56.974
from Jacqueline Ashby.

00:47:56.998 --> 00:47:59.429
Anna sort of stole my last question,

00:47:59.453 --> 00:48:03.663
which was to restore
our faith in humanity.

00:48:03.687 --> 00:48:06.181
But, there's so much interest
coming in about NDI.

00:48:06.205 --> 00:48:08.572
Is there a way for people to learn more,

00:48:08.596 --> 00:48:11.803
for you to share your study
and your methodology?

00:48:12.636 --> 00:48:14.121
DS: Happy to do so.

00:48:14.145 --> 00:48:16.663
There is nothing proprietary about it.

00:48:16.687 --> 00:48:20.866
We would love for this to be --

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:25.218
look, and this may not be
the be-all and end-all measurement.

00:48:25.242 --> 00:48:27.931
It's the best one we could come up with,

00:48:27.955 --> 00:48:30.617
but if working within the community,

00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:35.770
we can evolve it and think about
maybe things that it missed

00:48:35.794 --> 00:48:39.623
or maybe things that could be done better,

00:48:39.647 --> 00:48:40.826
that would be fantastic.

00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:43.829
I don't know the best way of doing that.

00:48:43.853 --> 00:48:48.610
I'll leave that to Corey and Whitney
to help me think that through,

00:48:48.634 --> 00:48:50.912
but of course we'd be willing to share it.

00:48:50.936 --> 00:48:54.915
There is nothing about that
that I don't want to share.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:57.725
CH: Sounds like a good TED Talk.

00:49:00.682 --> 00:49:05.090
Thank you so much, Dan. This has been
a super-interesting conversation.

00:49:05.114 --> 00:49:08.045
I think we could talk for another hour,

00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:10.474
but thank you so much for being here.

00:49:11.444 --> 00:49:14.415
DS: Thank you, Corey. Thank you, Whitney.
Thank you, everybody.

00:49:14.439 --> 00:49:16.046
WPR: Thank you, Dan. Thank you.
