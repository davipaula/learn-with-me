Whitney Pennington Rodgers:
Hi, Roz Brewer.

00:00:14.913 --> 00:00:16.785
Thanks so much for being with us today.

00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:18.794
Rosalind Brewer: Thank you for having me.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:20.300
WPR: We can just dive right in.

00:00:20.324 --> 00:00:23.579
We're right now
in the last quarter of 2020,

00:00:23.603 --> 00:00:27.546
and I think that a lot of people
would agree that we're in the midst

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.236
of what's probably one of the largest
reckonings around racial equity

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.520
that we've had in this country in decades.

00:00:33.544 --> 00:00:37.372
And it's something that you've been
such a vocal advocate for,

00:00:37.396 --> 00:00:40.015
both through your role at Starbucks

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.305
and throughout your career of diversity
and inclusion in the workplace.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.664
And so I'm curious just to hear from you
to start off the conversation,

00:00:47.688 --> 00:00:50.606
what this moment means for DEI efforts,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.096
not just in corporate America
but in business in general.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.381
RB: You are right

00:00:55.405 --> 00:00:59.434
that this has made many of us that are
in the corporate setting and beyond

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:04.744
to rethink the position on diversity
and inclusion in the workplace.

00:01:04.768 --> 00:01:09.208
You know, let me start the conversation
about where are we actually

00:01:09.232 --> 00:01:12.104
in diversity and inclusion
in the corporate setting,

00:01:12.128 --> 00:01:17.102
and I will tell you that this is actually
putting a spotlight on the weaknesses

00:01:17.126 --> 00:01:19.394
and maybe the lack of forethought

00:01:19.418 --> 00:01:26.127
and intensity that we should always
have maintained on this subject all along.

00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:29.982
One of the things that I think
it's been highlighting for most of us

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:33.864
is that our biggest
opportunity is inclusion.

00:01:33.888 --> 00:01:39.208
Because, you know,
I have heard the stories so many times

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:42.167
about how there's
no Black talent out there,

00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:45.007
no Latinx talent
for these particular roles.

00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:46.663
The talent is out there.

00:01:46.687 --> 00:01:48.669
I will tell you that it's underdeveloped,

00:01:48.693 --> 00:01:52.520
because I think we have spent more time
trying to reach numbers

00:01:52.544 --> 00:01:54.796
than we have changing our environment

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.967
where people feel safe,

00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:59.920
where they feel they can come to work
and be their whole self,

00:01:59.944 --> 00:02:01.439
give it everything they've got,

00:02:01.463 --> 00:02:02.973
be their natural self

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:06.104
and be respected for it
and applauded for it,

00:02:06.128 --> 00:02:10.094
and for people to recognize
and appreciate their differences

00:02:10.118 --> 00:02:12.167
and understand that they're differences,

00:02:12.191 --> 00:02:15.628
and if they're included
in the conversations,

00:02:15.652 --> 00:02:18.901
that they're just a better resource
for the companies.

00:02:18.925 --> 00:02:22.527
So I think there's so much opportunity
in the inclusion space,

00:02:22.551 --> 00:02:25.089
because we focus too much
on meeting metrics.

00:02:26.026 --> 00:02:28.441
WPR: And, you know,
I think earlier this year

00:02:28.465 --> 00:02:31.481
when the protests began
right after the death of George Floyd,

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:36.019
we saw lots of organizations
put out these statements of solidarity,

00:02:36.043 --> 00:02:39.827
these commitments
to do more to be inclusive

00:02:39.851 --> 00:02:41.381
both in their workspace

00:02:41.405 --> 00:02:45.072
and for their customers
and people who support their work.

00:02:45.096 --> 00:02:46.580
But then you also hear --

00:02:46.604 --> 00:02:49.615
I've heard a lot of business leaders
say things like, "You know,

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.550
we want to do something
but don't really know where to start."

00:02:52.574 --> 00:02:55.983
And so I'm curious to hear from you
just sort of what do you think

00:02:56.007 --> 00:02:59.295
are ways that you actually
can make a real difference

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.157
when it comes to thinking
about diversity and inclusion

00:03:03.181 --> 00:03:06.568
and avoid sort of this
performative justice?

00:03:06.592 --> 00:03:07.761
RB: Yes.

00:03:07.785 --> 00:03:11.599
So there's a few things
that I think about in this space.

00:03:11.623 --> 00:03:14.451
First of all, when you think
about an inclusive environment,

00:03:14.475 --> 00:03:16.658
you think about: Am I being heard?

00:03:16.682 --> 00:03:20.349
And most people with differences,

00:03:20.373 --> 00:03:24.623
they want to know that you are heard
and that you are seen.

00:03:24.647 --> 00:03:27.673
And I really applaud the companies
who have been spending time

00:03:27.697 --> 00:03:30.050
just putting themselves
on a learning journey,

00:03:30.074 --> 00:03:32.314
you know, holding listening sessions,

00:03:32.338 --> 00:03:38.260
trying to make sure that
we've got different viewpoints

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:40.563
when big decisions are made.

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:44.110
You know, there are some companies
who are engaging their partner networks

00:03:44.134 --> 00:03:46.090
in ways that they've never done before.

00:03:46.114 --> 00:03:48.746
I think those are some
early success factors

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.286
that could lead us
to different kinds of conversations.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.684
And I've been listening to
a lot of my peers in different industries,

00:03:55.708 --> 00:03:58.850
and they're having
their own personal aha moments,

00:03:58.874 --> 00:04:02.417
and they're actually checking themselves
at the front door, saying,

00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:04.094
"I never thought," "I never knew,"

00:04:04.118 --> 00:04:08.679
"I didn't know what I was doing
when I said X, or when I did this." Right?

00:04:08.703 --> 00:04:12.731
And so I think it starts
with some very simple things.

00:04:12.755 --> 00:04:15.108
I'd say that there are
a lot of steps to take

00:04:15.132 --> 00:04:17.544
before training and development,
that's for sure.

00:04:17.568 --> 00:04:20.998
So those that are jumping quickly
into training and development,

00:04:21.022 --> 00:04:24.459
I'd say put a pause on it
and just get back to grassroots

00:04:24.483 --> 00:04:26.642
and hold listening sessions
and then decide,

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:28.076
what do you want to do?

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.184
And then help those people
of diverse backgrounds

00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:35.024
engage in those conversations about
how they want to see change happen.

00:04:35.048 --> 00:04:38.100
They're the best resource
for a lot of this

00:04:38.124 --> 00:04:39.816
and a lot of these discussions.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.387
I mean, I learned so much.

00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:45.527
I have breakfast sessions
with the baristas and partners

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:47.756
at Starbucks regularly.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.800
I just had one yesterday,
and when my screen popped up,

00:04:50.824 --> 00:04:55.012
I had nine diverse
randomly selected partners.

00:04:55.036 --> 00:04:57.276
We call our employees "partners."

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.219
And it was such a rich conversation,

00:05:00.243 --> 00:05:03.623
and they began to network
while I'm talking to them, right,

00:05:03.647 --> 00:05:05.568
they were learning from each other.

00:05:05.592 --> 00:05:07.608
And this wasn't a diversity conversation.

00:05:07.632 --> 00:05:11.080
We were actually kicking off
our new financial year at Starbucks,

00:05:11.104 --> 00:05:14.183
and so this was actually
a business conversation

00:05:14.207 --> 00:05:16.668
and a touch-base to see how you're doing

00:05:16.692 --> 00:05:18.584
while we're working remotely.

00:05:18.608 --> 00:05:21.928
And, you know, it starts there
with building relationships

00:05:21.952 --> 00:05:26.172
and learning people for who they are
and engaging them and saying,

00:05:26.196 --> 00:05:27.761
"I see you, I hear you."

00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:33.000
That goes such a long way
that I think if we do more of that,

00:05:33.024 --> 00:05:35.416
I even think the engagement
and performance

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.985
just goes through the roof.

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.556
WPR: And so what I hear you saying, then,
is that it's less about

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.897
this short-term "how can I respond
to this moment right now?"

00:05:43.921 --> 00:05:47.847
and it's more about
long-term engagement with people

00:05:47.871 --> 00:05:51.889
and making this part of the fabric
of how you do your work.

00:05:51.913 --> 00:05:55.296
And so I'm curious also to hear
a little bit about,

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.497
just, I guess if there is a timeline,

00:05:57.521 --> 00:06:02.868
when people think about how quickly
they should be responding to protests

00:06:02.892 --> 00:06:07.282
and to what's happening
in this cultural moment.

00:06:07.306 --> 00:06:09.666
What should we actually be looking at

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:15.616
as far as when we see this change
actually materialize and take effect?

00:06:16.402 --> 00:06:19.144
RB: Yes. So I think there are
some short-term things.

00:06:19.168 --> 00:06:25.842
There are some really key partnerships
in the communities around our localities

00:06:25.866 --> 00:06:28.397
that are really important to also engage

00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:31.971
in some of the listening
and learning sessions as well.

00:06:31.995 --> 00:06:38.135
I learn tons from organizations
like the Legal Defense Fund,

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:39.576
from the NAACP,

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.259
and engaging those partnerships
that we've had over the years,

00:06:43.283 --> 00:06:46.226
but changing the discussion
of the conversation

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.389
about how do we partner together.

00:06:48.413 --> 00:06:51.628
Because one of the things
that I fear for being a retailer

00:06:51.652 --> 00:06:55.312
like Starbucks and many other companies

00:06:55.336 --> 00:06:59.868
is that I want my partners to feel
not only safe, comfortable,

00:06:59.892 --> 00:07:01.609
heard and seen in the company,

00:07:01.633 --> 00:07:04.831
I want them to have that same
experience in the community.

00:07:04.855 --> 00:07:07.217
And so that's when it comes full circle.

00:07:07.241 --> 00:07:11.969
I really want diverse BIPOC employees

00:07:11.993 --> 00:07:15.051
to feel like, you know,
"I make a difference."

00:07:15.075 --> 00:07:17.551
First of all, I vote every year.

00:07:17.575 --> 00:07:19.048
I'm engaged in my community.

00:07:19.072 --> 00:07:20.559
And then I'm engaged in work.

00:07:20.583 --> 00:07:21.801
So I have value.

00:07:21.825 --> 00:07:24.039
And so I think there are
some key partnerships

00:07:24.063 --> 00:07:25.931
that should happen right now

00:07:25.955 --> 00:07:28.624
so that we can make sure
that our employees feel like

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:33.950
they have a full way to engage
in this change that's underfoot right now.

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:37.510
WPR: And then I wonder, conversely,

00:07:37.534 --> 00:07:41.616
what sort of pitfalls have you seen
business leaders fall into

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.229
that are actually just not effective

00:07:44.253 --> 00:07:46.595
and are not supportive of efforts

00:07:46.619 --> 00:07:49.515
to be more inclusive and to diversify?

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:51.782
What are some of the things
that haven't worked?

00:07:51.806 --> 00:07:57.160
RB: Yeah, you know, I worry about
the race for numbers, to meet numbers,

00:07:57.184 --> 00:08:01.226
because what you will find,
I've found many times in my career,

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.689
is that some of our best leaders
have good intentions,

00:08:04.713 --> 00:08:06.067
but they don't understand.

00:08:06.091 --> 00:08:09.203
They don't understand
the partner sitting next to them

00:08:09.227 --> 00:08:11.063
that looks different from them.

00:08:11.087 --> 00:08:13.520
And so I worry about
when we race to numbers,

00:08:13.544 --> 00:08:15.325
because, you know what?

00:08:15.349 --> 00:08:18.488
The kind of country we live in,
the world we live in,

00:08:18.512 --> 00:08:20.298
we all know how to make numbers work.

00:08:20.322 --> 00:08:23.803
What we don't know how to do
is to build strong relationships

00:08:23.827 --> 00:08:26.067
that are lasting, that are valued.

00:08:26.091 --> 00:08:28.105
And I think that's where we need to start,

00:08:28.129 --> 00:08:31.317
is relationship-building
and key partnerships.

00:08:31.341 --> 00:08:34.695
So I worry about the numbers base.

00:08:37.071 --> 00:08:40.611
WPR: And so, of course, I think
we all remember a few years back,

00:08:40.635 --> 00:08:43.962
Starbucks had a very public issue.

00:08:43.986 --> 00:08:46.436
You were embroiled
in that incident in Philadelphia

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:47.822
around racial discrimination

00:08:47.846 --> 00:08:53.065
that led to Starbucks taking a step back
and thinking about inclusion

00:08:53.089 --> 00:08:56.872
and implicit bias and racial sensitivity.

00:08:57.467 --> 00:09:01.670
So how did that experience
help prepare you for this year,

00:09:01.694 --> 00:09:06.593
both as an individual business leader
and then also as an organization?

00:09:06.617 --> 00:09:09.906
How did it help you approach
what we've been experiencing

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.834
in this country in the past few months?

00:09:11.858 --> 00:09:15.665
RB: So, that was
a real example of leadership

00:09:15.689 --> 00:09:21.583
and, actually, where Starbucks had failed
in selecting the right leadership

00:09:21.607 --> 00:09:23.472
for that store.

00:09:23.496 --> 00:09:25.990
And to give you an example,

00:09:26.014 --> 00:09:27.839
the person that was running that store

00:09:27.863 --> 00:09:32.392
was a very young, up-and-coming
leader for the company,

00:09:32.416 --> 00:09:37.985
and to put her in a store
in 18th and Spruce in Philadelphia

00:09:38.009 --> 00:09:39.779
was an opportunity for all of us.

00:09:39.803 --> 00:09:45.251
So in retrospect, one of the reasons
why we did the antibias training

00:09:45.275 --> 00:09:47.752
was to make sure that
we began those conversations.

00:09:47.776 --> 00:09:50.785
And when I talk
about not just training --

00:09:50.809 --> 00:09:54.973
that training was very unique
because it was self-engaged.

00:09:54.997 --> 00:09:57.372
They weren't being
taught by an instructor.

00:09:57.396 --> 00:10:00.399
They had to have conversations
with their peer baristas

00:10:00.423 --> 00:10:04.262
around diversity and inclusion
amongst themselves.

00:10:04.286 --> 00:10:07.323
So it wasn't moderated
by any leader in the company.

00:10:07.347 --> 00:10:09.819
It was self-instructive.

00:10:09.843 --> 00:10:12.519
And the conversations that were created

00:10:12.543 --> 00:10:16.211
once we had that kind
of relationship-building --

00:10:16.235 --> 00:10:18.531
you know, we had
some of our baristas asking us,

00:10:18.555 --> 00:10:20.628
"Can I take this home
and talk to my father,

00:10:20.652 --> 00:10:23.004
who never let me take
the Black girl to the prom?"

00:10:23.028 --> 00:10:27.932
You know, we started what we felt
like a movement and a discussion

00:10:27.956 --> 00:10:32.166
that we have been able
to really use from that point on

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.992
in terms of the way we want
to escalate the conversations

00:10:35.016 --> 00:10:36.815
and make change happen at Starbucks,

00:10:36.839 --> 00:10:39.170
and not only at Starbucks
but in our communities,

00:10:39.194 --> 00:10:43.334
because there were quite a few
organizations that we reached out to

00:10:43.358 --> 00:10:46.257
that we're still engaged with today

00:10:46.281 --> 00:10:50.166
that are helping us build
community leadership as well.

00:10:51.178 --> 00:10:52.426
WPR: And is that the goal?

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:56.046
I mean, you mentioning an employee
who wanted to take their learnings home.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.828
Is the goal in thinking about how you
approach these issues as an organization

00:11:00.852 --> 00:11:03.511
for your employees and your partners

00:11:03.535 --> 00:11:07.679
to see how they can move this
beyond just their work life?

00:11:07.703 --> 00:11:11.129
RB: Sure. You know,
a lot of this starts at home.

00:11:11.153 --> 00:11:14.015
It starts with what happens
at your dinner table. Right?

00:11:14.039 --> 00:11:18.664
And so we can correct what happens
and we're responsible for what happens

00:11:18.688 --> 00:11:20.839
when you come to work at Starbucks,

00:11:20.863 --> 00:11:25.924
but we also realize that
we can only get them ever so far,

00:11:25.948 --> 00:11:28.424
but if you're at the table
having some conversations

00:11:28.448 --> 00:11:31.206
that are counter to what
you're learning in the workplace,

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.942
you can't help but slow down
your growth and your change.

00:11:33.966 --> 00:11:38.392
And so a lot of the work that we do
around diversity and inclusion

00:11:38.416 --> 00:11:39.706
is open-sourced.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:42.841
So when we created
the materials for the work

00:11:42.865 --> 00:11:46.950
when we had the closing
of our stores on May 28th,

00:11:46.974 --> 00:11:51.163
we had given that to so many
other companies for them to use,

00:11:51.187 --> 00:11:56.363
and even we're doing some work right now
around Courageous Conversations.

00:11:56.387 --> 00:11:58.534
And in this remote world,

00:11:58.558 --> 00:12:02.457
we're allowing our partners
to bring their families onto the camera

00:12:02.481 --> 00:12:03.664
or listen in the room

00:12:03.688 --> 00:12:06.292
as we have courageous
conversations on diversity.

00:12:06.316 --> 00:12:11.585
So if Starbucks has a keynote speaker
on a certain diversity topic,

00:12:11.609 --> 00:12:13.054
we invite the family in.

00:12:13.078 --> 00:12:15.136
And it's been really, it's been great.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.988
A lot of our senior executives have said,

00:12:18.012 --> 00:12:22.193
"This is starting new conversations
with my teens at home,"

00:12:22.217 --> 00:12:24.296
who are either getting bullied ...

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.457
These are changing the conversations
about why we question

00:12:27.481 --> 00:12:30.002
some of the actions
that we had around our house.

00:12:30.026 --> 00:12:35.326
And so we need to understand
that to embrace this issue,

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.497
it is not as small as numbers,

00:12:37.521 --> 00:12:39.561
it's not as small as just the workplace.

00:12:39.585 --> 00:12:42.579
It is very comprehensive.

00:12:42.603 --> 00:12:45.056
So we're trying to do
something different here

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.264
to change the conversations
and then actually grow inclusion

00:12:48.288 --> 00:12:50.175
in a very, very grassroots way

00:12:50.199 --> 00:12:51.958
at Starbucks.

00:12:52.853 --> 00:12:56.907
WPR: And, of course, I would imagine
as a Black woman and a business leader

00:12:56.931 --> 00:13:00.480
that these issues hit
really close to home for you.

00:13:00.504 --> 00:13:03.512
And I'm curious just
with your interactions

00:13:03.536 --> 00:13:06.830
with colleagues and counterparts
at other organizations

00:13:06.854 --> 00:13:09.398
that perhaps there isn't
that same level of investment

00:13:09.422 --> 00:13:13.672
because it isn't something
that's as important personally.

00:13:13.696 --> 00:13:18.706
And I'm curious how you are able
to begin those conversations

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.434
with colleagues and counterparts

00:13:20.458 --> 00:13:23.101
who are in positions to bring
about this sort of change

00:13:23.125 --> 00:13:24.398
in their own organizations

00:13:24.422 --> 00:13:25.880
or within Starbucks.

00:13:25.904 --> 00:13:28.102
How do you get them invested,

00:13:28.126 --> 00:13:31.339
and how do you, frankly,
get them to care about this?

00:13:31.363 --> 00:13:33.255
RB: Yeah, that's a very good question.

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:34.815
So, I have two children.

00:13:34.839 --> 00:13:38.791
I have a daughter who is 17
and a son who is 25.

00:13:38.815 --> 00:13:41.321
And quite honestly,
when that situation happened

00:13:41.345 --> 00:13:44.748
in our Starbucks stores back in 2018,

00:13:44.772 --> 00:13:48.064
my son was the same
exact age as Donte and Rashon

00:13:48.088 --> 00:13:50.098
and looks a lot like them, by the way,

00:13:50.122 --> 00:13:52.253
and would have been sitting
in the Starbucks

00:13:52.277 --> 00:13:53.766
dressed the same way they were.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.665
So that incident alone
was deeply personal to me,

00:13:56.689 --> 00:13:59.855
actually made me grab my chest, right?

00:13:59.879 --> 00:14:01.622
Because I knew at any given moment

00:14:01.646 --> 00:14:04.511
my husband or my son
could get pulled over,

00:14:04.535 --> 00:14:06.884
and I'd get that call
in the middle of the night.

00:14:06.908 --> 00:14:09.046
So it's deeply personal for me,

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:11.860
and what I try to do is I share stories,

00:14:11.884 --> 00:14:15.505
and I talk very openly about my family
and what we do on the weekends

00:14:15.529 --> 00:14:18.704
and our holiday traditions
and all of those things.

00:14:18.728 --> 00:14:21.544
And I have no issue
with someone leaning over to me,

00:14:21.568 --> 00:14:23.308
maybe one of my white counterparts,

00:14:23.332 --> 00:14:26.329
saying, "I don't understand that.
What are they talking about?"

00:14:26.353 --> 00:14:30.464
when they hear something that's
a little bit different than their culture.

00:14:30.488 --> 00:14:34.010
And I'm wide open to explain
and have those conversations,

00:14:34.034 --> 00:14:38.394
because I feel like I really want
to be a conduit for that.

00:14:38.418 --> 00:14:41.991
I always tell everyone,
no question's too small or too big.

00:14:42.015 --> 00:14:44.316
Even with everything
that's going on right now

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.505
in our environment around social unrest,

00:14:46.529 --> 00:14:52.872
I've gotten tons of calls
from my white peers at different companies

00:14:52.896 --> 00:14:55.438
saying, "Roz, what do you think?
What are you hearing?

00:14:55.462 --> 00:14:56.616
Help me out here."

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.793
I'll drop everything,

00:14:57.817 --> 00:15:00.081
because if I can help,
and I'll tell the story,

00:15:00.105 --> 00:15:03.143
and I think most people know
if they've known me over the years.

00:15:03.167 --> 00:15:04.688
I'm pretty frank and outspoken.

00:15:04.712 --> 00:15:07.246
And I'll also tell them
when they've really messed up

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.971
and what they need to do about it.

00:15:08.995 --> 00:15:13.135
And so I think I want more Black leaders

00:15:13.159 --> 00:15:16.664
to feel just as confident in doing that.

00:15:16.688 --> 00:15:18.491
I see no risk in it.

00:15:18.515 --> 00:15:22.685
I do realize that it begins
a new relationship with some people,

00:15:22.709 --> 00:15:25.191
and some people can't take
the tough conversations,

00:15:25.215 --> 00:15:27.951
but it's time for tough conversations.

00:15:27.975 --> 00:15:29.520
WPR: And, I mean, to that point,

00:15:29.544 --> 00:15:31.645
I imagine there are probably
also people who,

00:15:31.669 --> 00:15:34.306
because these conversations
are tough and uncomfortable,

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:39.295
think maybe it's easier or better
to just avoid having to do that

00:15:39.319 --> 00:15:42.144
and to have those
conversations and discussions

00:15:42.168 --> 00:15:43.873
to stir the pot in some ways.

00:15:43.897 --> 00:15:45.816
And so what do you say to the people

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.592
who think "Let's just try to lay low,"

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:52.908
and I've heard some of this, too,
in this moment, "Let the moment pass

00:15:52.932 --> 00:15:55.422
so that we can get back
to business as usual"?

00:15:55.446 --> 00:15:58.506
RB: Yeah. Well, I'd first start off
by saying how disgusted I am

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.311
by that statement,

00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:03.824
because leaders lead in the moment,

00:16:03.848 --> 00:16:06.467
and you never know when
you're going to be called upon.

00:16:06.491 --> 00:16:08.353
And if this isn't a calling,

00:16:08.377 --> 00:16:09.556
I don't know what is.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.689
And so when I get that call and say,

00:16:11.713 --> 00:16:14.150
"You know, I just think
I should take the back seat

00:16:14.174 --> 00:16:18.021
and just kind of let this brew here
and that calm down,"

00:16:18.045 --> 00:16:21.973
you know, we need to all --
it's an all-in moment.

00:16:21.997 --> 00:16:26.298
And leadership is not
designated by your title.

00:16:26.322 --> 00:16:30.306
It's designated about how great
you can create followership.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:35.267
And having thought leadership,

00:16:35.291 --> 00:16:38.083
people underestimate the opportunity

00:16:38.107 --> 00:16:41.283
to pick up the phone and call someone,
and say, "How are you?

00:16:41.307 --> 00:16:44.155
How is this affecting you?
How can I help?"

00:16:44.179 --> 00:16:45.600
That's pretty simple.

00:16:45.624 --> 00:16:48.030
You might decide it's something
I can't help with,

00:16:48.054 --> 00:16:50.117
but you'd better darn sure
pick up the phone

00:16:50.141 --> 00:16:52.029
and start feeling out the environment

00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:55.238
in your employee base,
in your peers, in your leaders,

00:16:55.262 --> 00:16:59.460
because the time is now,
and so I don't give them an out.

00:16:59.484 --> 00:17:03.431
I actually try and push them
over the edge,

00:17:03.455 --> 00:17:06.975
because sometimes they are
just kind of stuck, like, "What do I do?"

00:17:06.999 --> 00:17:10.613
And then the other thing
that I personally have to do

00:17:10.637 --> 00:17:12.397
is to make sure that they understand

00:17:12.421 --> 00:17:14.927
that because I am
at this level where I am,

00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:18.160
I'm not excluded from these issues, right?

00:17:18.184 --> 00:17:21.404
I know that when my husband
jumps in his vehicle,

00:17:21.428 --> 00:17:24.213
I worry every time
if he's out in the evening

00:17:24.237 --> 00:17:26.993
that he may not come back home
the same way he left.

00:17:27.017 --> 00:17:29.738
I feel that way for my son
and for my husband.

00:17:29.762 --> 00:17:32.923
I still get, even when I go shopping,

00:17:32.947 --> 00:17:36.387
I still get the look, am I stealing,

00:17:36.411 --> 00:17:38.573
watching me as I walk around the corner.

00:17:38.597 --> 00:17:42.448
And I don't know what else or how else
I can look or act any different,

00:17:42.472 --> 00:17:43.933
so I just act like myself.

00:17:43.957 --> 00:17:47.055
I used to get dressed to go shopping.

00:17:47.079 --> 00:17:48.539
Now I never do that.

00:17:48.563 --> 00:17:51.930
If I'm spending my money,
my money spends everywhere,

00:17:51.954 --> 00:17:55.575
and if I get that feeling that you're
going to race me around the store,

00:17:55.599 --> 00:17:57.760
then I'm going to leave,
and that's your loss.

00:17:57.784 --> 00:18:00.792
But I still get that, and so I worry.

00:18:00.816 --> 00:18:07.207
So I also try to help people understand
that this is not a socioeconomic,

00:18:07.231 --> 00:18:10.386
once you've sort of "made it,"
you're out of the water.

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:11.570
No.

00:18:11.594 --> 00:18:17.913
We're still, as someone with differences,
visible differences, you're still at risk.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:23.101
WPR: And so much of this
conversation also is about

00:18:23.125 --> 00:18:25.878
who's in leadership
and who's making these decisions

00:18:25.902 --> 00:18:29.667
and representation at high levels.

00:18:29.691 --> 00:18:33.352
And I know that you've been really vocal
about your own experiences

00:18:33.376 --> 00:18:37.149
as a woman color, person of color,
as a Black woman,

00:18:37.173 --> 00:18:40.371
in these executive positions,

00:18:40.395 --> 00:18:45.032
and often feeling you are
the only one in some rooms,

00:18:45.056 --> 00:18:46.764
and sort of the isolation of that,

00:18:46.788 --> 00:18:52.000
but also the challenges in making choices
and getting things done

00:18:52.024 --> 00:18:53.382
when that's the case.

00:18:53.406 --> 00:18:55.188
And so I'm curious also,

00:18:55.212 --> 00:18:58.179
what are the opportunities
that this moment presents

00:18:58.203 --> 00:19:00.361
for us to perhaps
approach this differently,

00:19:00.385 --> 00:19:04.050
and how can people
at different organizations

00:19:04.074 --> 00:19:08.397
who are looking to bring people in
to positions of leadership,

00:19:08.421 --> 00:19:11.825
how can we approach this differently
so that we can begin to see

00:19:11.849 --> 00:19:14.286
more people of color in these roles?

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.461
RB: Sure.

00:19:15.485 --> 00:19:17.156
It's been my experience

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:23.015
that I see tons of great, diverse talent
coming in to companies,

00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:25.038
and then they're stuck.

00:19:25.062 --> 00:19:29.601
And what I see is the pipeline
is very weak at a certain level,

00:19:29.625 --> 00:19:34.705
and once it gets to the point
of trying to decide on a succession plan

00:19:34.729 --> 00:19:37.157
for who's next in line for the big jobs,

00:19:37.181 --> 00:19:40.881
there's this great talent
that's like that mid-level manager area,

00:19:40.905 --> 00:19:42.169
then there's a big gap,

00:19:42.193 --> 00:19:44.335
and then there's maybe two at the top.

00:19:44.359 --> 00:19:47.090
And it puts a lot of pressure
on those two on the top

00:19:47.114 --> 00:19:49.668
to try and go down and grab
those that are just,

00:19:49.692 --> 00:19:52.651
maybe been with the company
for two to five years,

00:19:52.675 --> 00:19:54.219
and lift them up.

00:19:54.243 --> 00:19:55.843
So what I think about is:

00:19:55.867 --> 00:19:59.118
How do we give extraordinary experiences

00:19:59.142 --> 00:20:01.879
to our youngest diverse talent

00:20:01.903 --> 00:20:04.873
so that they can get
that exposure early on

00:20:04.897 --> 00:20:08.790
and begin to develop early on
just like their white peers?

00:20:08.814 --> 00:20:12.078
And I think sometimes
we celebrate too much

00:20:12.102 --> 00:20:14.674
that they are part of the company,

00:20:14.698 --> 00:20:18.218
but what we need to celebrate is,
where is their progression?

00:20:18.242 --> 00:20:20.193
Where is their opportunity for growth?

00:20:20.217 --> 00:20:21.408
Who's listening to them,

00:20:21.432 --> 00:20:23.242
and who has their hands on them?

00:20:23.266 --> 00:20:27.433
And one of the things
that we're doing at Starbucks

00:20:27.457 --> 00:20:30.423
is really having structured mentorship.

00:20:30.447 --> 00:20:35.783
But the mentorship looks a lot more
like being a sponsor.

00:20:35.807 --> 00:20:42.548
And so, our executive leaders
will be responsible for the development

00:20:42.572 --> 00:20:45.033
of our young, diverse talent

00:20:45.057 --> 00:20:48.648
and making sure that they're getting
that exposure and those opportunities.

00:20:48.672 --> 00:20:51.840
And just imagine if you're
a new hire in the company,

00:20:51.864 --> 00:20:55.957
and someone wants to meet with you
at a senior level once a month,

00:20:55.981 --> 00:20:57.397
twice a year, even --

00:20:57.421 --> 00:20:58.594
that's game-changing.

00:20:58.618 --> 00:21:03.188
And so we have to reach
our young talent early,

00:21:03.212 --> 00:21:06.027
and now this pipeline has got to close.

00:21:06.051 --> 00:21:07.575
We've got to fill it up

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:08.857
and close this gap,

00:21:08.881 --> 00:21:11.409
because if not, I don't see a pathway

00:21:11.433 --> 00:21:15.394
for diverse executives,
C-suite executives,

00:21:15.418 --> 00:21:18.492
in the next, I would say,
three to five years,

00:21:18.516 --> 00:21:21.176
I don't see a lot of placements happening.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.744
WPR: And are you hopeful in this moment?

00:21:24.768 --> 00:21:28.508
Do you feel like we are
making progress towards this?

00:21:29.547 --> 00:21:31.396
RB: It's early days.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.777
I'm hopeful.

00:21:34.619 --> 00:21:38.294
I feel good about the conversations
that are happening.

00:21:38.318 --> 00:21:44.475
I'm seeing change in people
thinking more about themselves

00:21:44.499 --> 00:21:49.790
when my white counterparts
are questioning some of their actions.

00:21:49.814 --> 00:21:54.067
And so I feel like we can't
let this moment leave us,

00:21:54.091 --> 00:21:55.751
and what we're learning about it.

00:21:55.775 --> 00:21:59.120
I think what I'm really optimistic about

00:21:59.144 --> 00:22:02.842
is that now I think
more people will understand

00:22:02.866 --> 00:22:07.049
that the less diverse
and less inclusive we are,

00:22:07.073 --> 00:22:09.722
it's more than a business imperative.

00:22:09.746 --> 00:22:12.207
When we combine the pandemic

00:22:12.231 --> 00:22:15.598
and we see the inequities of a pandemic

00:22:15.622 --> 00:22:17.516
on a diverse community,

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:19.764
and we talk about how that happens,

00:22:19.788 --> 00:22:23.751
how people are underrepresented
in health care,

00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:26.747
underrepresented in their housing,

00:22:26.771 --> 00:22:29.994
they can see that this
is a groundswell moment.

00:22:30.018 --> 00:22:34.488
And the more we realize that
and talk about that complexity,

00:22:34.512 --> 00:22:36.467
then the solutions begin to happen.

00:22:36.491 --> 00:22:39.064
And I think that's happening
more and more,

00:22:39.088 --> 00:22:40.736
so I'm optimistic about that,

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:47.059
because we're looking at the ills
of lack of diversity and inclusion,

00:22:47.083 --> 00:22:50.048
and maybe looking
at much broader solutions for it

00:22:50.072 --> 00:22:51.840
than what we have in the past.

00:22:52.514 --> 00:22:55.795
WPR: Thank you so much, Roz.
This was such a meaningful conversation.

00:22:55.819 --> 00:22:57.500
It was great to hear your insights.

00:22:57.524 --> 00:22:59.134
RB: Thank you.
