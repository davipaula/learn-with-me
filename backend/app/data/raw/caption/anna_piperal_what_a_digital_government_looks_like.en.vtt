00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.809
Almost 30 years ago,

00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:18.750
my country was facing the need
to rebuild everything from scratch.

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.518
After years of Soviet occupation,

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:25.768
Estonia regained its independence,
but we were left with nothing.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:30.226
No infrastructure,
no administration, no legal code.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.125
Organizational chaos.

00:00:32.708 --> 00:00:33.976
Out of necessity,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.434
the state leaders back then
had to make some daring choices.

00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:40.018
The ones that our country could afford.

00:00:40.042 --> 00:00:42.934
There was a lot of
experimentation and uncertainty

00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:44.768
but also a bit of luck involved,

00:00:44.792 --> 00:00:47.434
particularly in the fact
that we could count on a number

00:00:47.458 --> 00:00:49.018
of brilliant visionaries,

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:52.184
cryptographers and engineers.

00:00:52.208 --> 00:00:54.476
I was just a kid back then.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.792
Today, we are called
the most digital society on earth.

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:01.434
I'm from Estonia,

00:01:01.458 --> 00:01:05.559
and we've been declaring
taxes online since 2001.

00:01:05.583 --> 00:01:10.309
We have been using digital identity
and signature since 2002.

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:13.684
We've been voting online since 2005.

00:01:13.708 --> 00:01:16.976
And for today, pretty much
the whole range of the public services

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.518
that you can imagine:

00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:23.059
education, police,
justice, starting a company,

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.976
applying for benefits,
looking at your health record

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.059
or challenging a parking ticket --

00:01:28.083 --> 00:01:31.143
that's everything that is done online.

00:01:31.167 --> 00:01:33.934
In fact, it's much easier to tell you

00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:37.351
what are the three things
we cannot yet do online.

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:40.768
We have to show up
to pick up our ID documents,

00:01:40.792 --> 00:01:42.851
get married or divorced,

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:44.684
or sell real estate.

00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:46.292
That's pretty much it.

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:51.809
So, that's why don't freak out

00:01:51.833 --> 00:01:53.934
when I tell you that every year

00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:57.851
I can't wait to start
doing my tax declaration.

00:01:57.875 --> 00:01:58.893
(Laughter)

00:01:58.917 --> 00:02:00.934
Because all I have to do

00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:03.059
is sit on my couch with a mobile phone,

00:02:03.083 --> 00:02:07.101
swipe a few pages with prefilled data
on income and deductions

00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:08.809
and hit submit.

00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:10.393
After three minutes,

00:02:10.417 --> 00:02:13.059
I'm looking at the tax return amount.

00:02:13.083 --> 00:02:17.393
It actually feels like
a quite rewarding experience.

00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:19.434
No tax advisors,

00:02:19.458 --> 00:02:21.726
no collecting receipts,

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.292
no doing the math.

00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:27.393
And have I mentioned
that I have not visited a state office

00:02:27.417 --> 00:02:28.958
for almost seven years?

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:33.976
Indeed, one of the features
of the modern life

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.184
that has no reason to exist anymore,

00:02:36.208 --> 00:02:39.018
considering technological
possibilities of today,

00:02:39.042 --> 00:02:41.684
is the labyrinth of bureaucracy.

00:02:41.708 --> 00:02:44.351
We've almost got rid of it
completely in Estonia,

00:02:44.375 --> 00:02:48.518
in an effort coordinated by the government
that has also digitized itself.

00:02:48.542 --> 00:02:53.458
For instance, cabinet of ministers' work
in e-Cabinet is absolutely paperless.

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:58.476
The central idea behind this development

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.184
is transformation of the state role

00:03:01.208 --> 00:03:04.125
and digitalization of trust.

00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:06.101
Think about it.

00:03:06.125 --> 00:03:09.976
In most countries, people
don't trust their governments.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.059
And the governments don't trust them back.

00:03:13.083 --> 00:03:16.351
And all the complicated
paper-based formal procedures

00:03:16.375 --> 00:03:18.851
are supposed to solve that problem.

00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:21.143
Except that they don't.

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:24.393
They just make life more complicated.

00:03:24.417 --> 00:03:29.101
I believe Estonian experience is showing
that technology can be the remedy

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:30.934
for getting the trust back,

00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:32.934
while creating an efficient,

00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:36.976
user-centric service delivery system

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.458
that actively responds to citizens' needs.

00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:45.768
We did not do it by digitizing
bureaucracy as it is.

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:50.184
But by rather agreeing
on a few strong, common principles,

00:03:50.208 --> 00:03:52.684
redesigning rules and procedures,

00:03:52.708 --> 00:03:55.309
getting rid of unnecessary data collection

00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:57.268
and task duplication,

00:03:57.292 --> 00:04:00.851
and becoming open and transparent.

00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:02.268
Let me give you a glimpse

00:04:02.292 --> 00:04:05.958
into some of the key e-Estonia
design principles today.

00:04:08.042 --> 00:04:12.893
First, it is essential to guarantee
privacy and confidentiality

00:04:12.917 --> 00:04:15.059
of data and information.

00:04:15.083 --> 00:04:18.643
This is achieved
through a strong digital identity

00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:20.518
that is issued by the state

00:04:20.542 --> 00:04:22.559
and compatible with everything.

00:04:22.583 --> 00:04:25.125
In fact, every Estonian has one.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.559
The identity is doubled
with a strong digital signature

00:04:30.583 --> 00:04:34.768
that is accepted, used and legally binding

00:04:34.792 --> 00:04:37.500
both in Estonia and the European Union.

00:04:38.708 --> 00:04:44.101
When the system can properly
and securely identify who is using it,

00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:49.018
after logging in, it will provide access
to the personal data of the citizen

00:04:49.042 --> 00:04:52.809
and all the public services
within one tool,

00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:56.625
and allow to authorize anything
by signing digitally.

00:04:58.583 --> 00:05:02.226
A second principle,
and one of the most transformative,

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.268
is called "Once only."

00:05:05.292 --> 00:05:09.184
It means that the state
cannot ask for the same data

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:11.059
more than once,

00:05:11.083 --> 00:05:14.893
nor can store it in more than one place.

00:05:14.917 --> 00:05:16.184
For instance,

00:05:16.208 --> 00:05:19.143
if you've already provided
your birth or marital certificate

00:05:19.167 --> 00:05:21.101
to the population registry,

00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:24.059
this is the only place
where this data is going to be held.

00:05:24.083 --> 00:05:28.625
And no other institution
will be ever asking for it again.

00:05:29.583 --> 00:05:32.684
Once only is a very powerful rule,

00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:36.768
as it defines the whole structure
of the data collection in a country,

00:05:36.792 --> 00:05:38.476
what information is collected

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.268
and who is responsible for maintaining it,

00:05:41.292 --> 00:05:44.393
making sure we avoid
centralization of data,

00:05:44.417 --> 00:05:46.184
duplication of data,

00:05:46.208 --> 00:05:49.208
and guarantee that it's
actually up to date.

00:05:50.792 --> 00:05:54.268
This distributed approach
also avoids the problem

00:05:54.292 --> 00:05:57.059
of the single point of failure.

00:05:57.083 --> 00:06:00.226
But since the data cannot be replicated,

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.351
or collected more than once,

00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:05.309
it means that the design
has to keep in mind

00:06:05.333 --> 00:06:08.851
secure and robust access
to that information at all times,

00:06:08.875 --> 00:06:12.083
so the public institution
can offer a service.

00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:17.559
This is exactly the role
of the data exchange platform

00:06:17.583 --> 00:06:19.768
called the X-Road

00:06:19.792 --> 00:06:22.708
that has been in use since 2001.

00:06:23.708 --> 00:06:25.351
Just like a highway,

00:06:25.375 --> 00:06:29.018
it connects public sector
databases and registries,

00:06:29.042 --> 00:06:31.851
local municipalities and businesses,

00:06:31.875 --> 00:06:37.309
organizing a real-time, secure
and regulated data exchange,

00:06:37.333 --> 00:06:41.542
saving an auditable trace after each move.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.143
Here's a screenshot of a live feed

00:06:46.167 --> 00:06:49.059
showing all the requests
performed on the X-Road

00:06:49.083 --> 00:06:52.458
and all the services
that it actually facilitates.

00:06:53.542 --> 00:06:56.351
And this is the real picture

00:06:56.375 --> 00:07:00.976
of all the connections between
public and private sector databases.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.268
As you can see,

00:07:02.292 --> 00:07:04.917
there is no central database whatsoever.

00:07:05.833 --> 00:07:09.559
Confidentiality and privacy
are definitely very important.

00:07:09.583 --> 00:07:11.476
But in the digital world,

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.476
reliability and integrity of information

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.708
is just critical for operations.

00:07:17.458 --> 00:07:18.726
For instance,

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.059
if someone changes
your medical health record,

00:07:21.083 --> 00:07:23.101
let's say allergies,

00:07:23.125 --> 00:07:25.684
without you or your doctor knowing,

00:07:25.708 --> 00:07:27.750
treatment could be deadly.

00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:32.518
That's why in a digital society,
a system like an Estonian one,

00:07:32.542 --> 00:07:35.309
when there's almost no paper originals,

00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:38.934
there's almost only digital originals,

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:41.059
integrity of data,

00:07:41.083 --> 00:07:43.934
data exchange rules, software components

00:07:43.958 --> 00:07:46.292
and log files is paramount.

00:07:47.583 --> 00:07:52.768
We use a form of blockchain
that we invented back in 2007,

00:07:52.792 --> 00:07:56.143
way before blockchain even became a thing,

00:07:56.167 --> 00:08:00.583
to check and guarantee
the integrity of data in real time.

00:08:01.417 --> 00:08:03.768
Blockchain is our auditor

00:08:03.792 --> 00:08:07.101
and a promise that no access to the data

00:08:07.125 --> 00:08:10.292
or data manipulation remains unrecorded.

00:08:14.083 --> 00:08:18.708
Data ownership is another key principle
in the design of the system.

00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:24.059
Aren't you worried by the fact
that governments, tech companies

00:08:24.083 --> 00:08:26.018
and other businesses around the world

00:08:26.042 --> 00:08:29.434
claim data they've collected
about you is theirs,

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:33.601
generally refuse to give access
to that information,

00:08:33.625 --> 00:08:36.976
and often fail to prove how it was used

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.167
or shared with third parties?

00:08:40.333 --> 00:08:43.958
I don't know, for me it seems
like a quite disturbing situation.

00:08:46.083 --> 00:08:49.684
The Estonian system
is based on the principle

00:08:49.708 --> 00:08:54.226
that an individual is the owner
of the data collected about him,

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:59.309
thus has an absolute right
to know what information is collected

00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:02.184
and who has been accessing it.

00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:06.309
Every time a policeman,
a doctor or any state officer

00:09:06.333 --> 00:09:09.893
is accessing personal information
of the citizens online,

00:09:09.917 --> 00:09:14.309
first they only get to access it
after logging in

00:09:14.333 --> 00:09:17.768
to the information they're authorized
to see to do their job.

00:09:17.792 --> 00:09:21.809
And secondly, every time
they're making requests,

00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:24.042
this is saved in a log file.

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:31.018
This detailed log file
is part of the state public services

00:09:31.042 --> 00:09:33.268
and allows real transparency,

00:09:33.292 --> 00:09:38.708
making sure no privacy violation
will remain unnoticed to the citizen.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.684
Now, of course, this is only
a simplified summary

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:48.375
of all the design principles
that e-Estonia is built on.

00:09:49.917 --> 00:09:52.333
And now, government is building up

00:09:53.458 --> 00:09:57.476
to get ready for use
of artificial intelligence

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.226
and building a whole new generation
of public services --

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.851
proactive services

00:10:02.875 --> 00:10:04.684
that would activate seamlessly

00:10:04.708 --> 00:10:07.976
based on different life situations
that people might be in,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.750
such as childbirth, unemployment
or starting a business.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:16.518
Now, of course,

00:10:16.542 --> 00:10:19.851
running a digital society
with no paper backup

00:10:19.875 --> 00:10:21.417
can be an issue, right?

00:10:22.417 --> 00:10:25.434
Even though we trust
our systems to be solid,

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:30.768
but one can never be too cautious
as we experienced back in 2007,

00:10:30.792 --> 00:10:34.559
when the first cyberincident happened,

00:10:34.583 --> 00:10:37.309
and it literally blocked
part of our networks,

00:10:37.333 --> 00:10:40.667
making access to the services
impossible for hours.

00:10:41.583 --> 00:10:43.226
We survived.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:48.476
But this event put cybersecurity
at the very top of agenda,

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.917
both in terms of strengthening
the platform and backing it up.

00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:58.518
So how do you back up
a country-wide system in a small state

00:10:58.542 --> 00:11:00.667
where everything is super close?

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.768
Well for instance,
you can export a copy of the data

00:11:05.792 --> 00:11:07.893
outside the country territory

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:11.542
to an extraterritorial
space of an embassy.

00:11:12.542 --> 00:11:15.851
Today, we have those data embassies

00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:20.309
that are holding the most critical
digital assets of Estonia,

00:11:20.333 --> 00:11:23.393
guaranteeing continuity of operations,

00:11:23.417 --> 00:11:24.934
protection of our data,

00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:28.226
and most importantly, our sovereignty.

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:32.250
Even in case of a physical attack
on our territory.

00:11:34.042 --> 00:11:36.018
Some of you might be thinking by now:

00:11:36.042 --> 00:11:37.958
Where are the downsides?

00:11:39.083 --> 00:11:41.559
Well, going all digital

00:11:41.583 --> 00:11:46.851
is administratively, and let's be honest,
financially more efficient.

00:11:46.875 --> 00:11:49.518
Interfacing primarily
with computer systems

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:52.351
might create an impression
that the human factor,

00:11:52.375 --> 00:11:54.184
elected politicians

00:11:54.208 --> 00:11:56.161
and participating in democratic processes

00:11:56.185 --> 00:11:59.018
is somehow less important.

00:11:59.042 --> 00:12:00.893
And there are also some people

00:12:00.917 --> 00:12:03.434
who feel threatened
by pervasive technology

00:12:03.458 --> 00:12:05.917
that might make their skills obsolete.

00:12:07.708 --> 00:12:10.059
So all in all, unfortunately,

00:12:10.083 --> 00:12:12.018
running a country on a digital platform

00:12:12.042 --> 00:12:15.768
has not saved us
from political power struggles

00:12:15.792 --> 00:12:18.393
and polarization in the society,

00:12:18.417 --> 00:12:20.976
as we have seen in the last elections.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.542
Well, until there are humans involved.

00:12:25.917 --> 00:12:28.643
One last question.

00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:31.059
If everything is location-independent

00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:34.726
and I can access all of the services
from anywhere in the world,

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.809
why cannot others
tap into some of these services,

00:12:37.833 --> 00:12:40.542
even if they don't reside
within Estonian borders?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.476
Five years ago,

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:47.851
we launched a governmental start-up
called e-Residency program

00:12:47.875 --> 00:12:52.393
that for today joins
tens of thousands of people.

00:12:52.417 --> 00:12:57.726
These are businessmen and women
from 136 different countries,

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:00.851
who establish their
businesses digitally,

00:13:00.875 --> 00:13:03.476
who do their banking online,

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:09.393
and who run their companies
virtually over e-Estonia platform,

00:13:09.417 --> 00:13:13.101
within European Union legal framework,

00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:16.851
using an e-identity card similar to mine

00:13:16.875 --> 00:13:20.167
and all of that
from anywhere in the world.

00:13:21.625 --> 00:13:25.143
The Estonian system
is location-independent

00:13:25.167 --> 00:13:26.851
and user-centric.

00:13:26.875 --> 00:13:32.018
It prioritizes inclusiveness,
openness and reliability.

00:13:32.042 --> 00:13:36.268
It puts security
and transparency at its center.

00:13:36.292 --> 00:13:40.184
And the data into the hands
of the rightful owner,

00:13:40.208 --> 00:13:42.684
the person they refer to.

00:13:42.708 --> 00:13:44.684
Don't take my word for it.

00:13:44.708 --> 00:13:46.309
Try it.

00:13:46.333 --> 00:13:47.684
Thank you.

00:13:47.708 --> 00:13:52.250
(Applause)
