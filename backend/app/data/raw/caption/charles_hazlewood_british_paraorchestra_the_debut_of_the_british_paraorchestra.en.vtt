00:00:06.895 --> 00:00:11.292
Music is the most universal language that we have,

00:00:11.292 --> 00:00:14.977
way more so than any dialect or tongue.

00:00:14.977 --> 00:00:17.112
You can play a melody to a child in China

00:00:17.112 --> 00:00:21.247
and the same melody to a child in South Africa.

00:00:21.247 --> 00:00:24.903
Despite the huge differences between those two children,

00:00:24.903 --> 00:00:29.500
they will still draw some of the same truths from that melody.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.466
Now I think the reason why music has this universality,

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:36.816
this way of speaking to each and every one of us,

00:00:36.816 --> 00:00:40.834
is that somehow it is capable of holding up a mirror to us

00:00:40.834 --> 00:00:44.165
that reveals, in some small or large way,

00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:48.716
a little bit of who or what we are.

00:00:48.716 --> 00:00:50.935
By logical extension of this,

00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:53.400
if music is this universal force,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.855
then surely groups of musicians,

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:57.383
let's call them orchestras,

00:00:57.383 --> 00:01:02.149
should reflect every aspect of the community.

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.468
Logical, but not necessarily true.

00:01:05.468 --> 00:01:08.966
At TEDxBrussels today, we've been looking forward to the future,

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.887
50 years from now, I' gonna ask you

00:01:10.887 --> 00:01:12.535
to go in the other direction for a minute,

00:01:12.535 --> 00:01:15.285
and to come back with me 50 years into the past,

00:01:15.285 --> 00:01:17.435
the early 1960s to be precise.

00:01:17.435 --> 00:01:20.246
And if you took a look at all the great orchestras

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:23.274
of the world at that time, a snapshot,

00:01:23.274 --> 00:01:24.932
how many women do you think you would find

00:01:24.932 --> 00:01:28.282
playing in those orchestras?

00:01:28.282 --> 00:01:31.366
The answer, virtually none.

00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:34.637
Well, here we are 50 years on, in 2011,

00:01:34.637 --> 00:01:36.948
and pretty much every orchestra on the planet

00:01:36.948 --> 00:01:41.135
has a fantastic and healthy balance between the sexes.

00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:45.102
Of course, I hear you say, totally logical.

00:01:45.102 --> 00:01:47.767
How about another aspect of the community?

00:01:47.767 --> 00:01:50.000
The disabled community.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.095
Do we find them well represented

00:01:53.095 --> 00:01:56.254
in the great orchestras of our world?

00:01:56.254 --> 00:01:58.168
Well, I can tell you as a conductor

00:01:58.168 --> 00:02:01.021
I work with orchestras around the world all the time

00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:03.583
and I can count on the fingers of one hand

00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:06.634
the number of disabled musicians I've encountered

00:02:06.634 --> 00:02:09.418
in any orchestra anywhere.

00:02:09.418 --> 00:02:11.783
Why is this?

00:02:11.783 --> 00:02:15.927
You can't tell me that there aren't millions upon millions

00:02:15.927 --> 00:02:21.974
of prodigiously gifted musicians of disability around the world.

00:02:21.974 --> 00:02:23.814
Where is that platform?

00:02:23.814 --> 00:02:26.782
Where is the infrastructure that creates a space for them

00:02:26.782 --> 00:02:32.213
so that they can collaborate with other great musicians?

00:02:32.213 --> 00:02:33.926
So, ladies and gentlemen, as you can probably tell

00:02:33.926 --> 00:02:35.460
I'm on a bit of a mission.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.743
And this mission has a personal root to it.

00:02:37.743 --> 00:02:41.555
I have four children, the youngest of whom was born with cerebral palsy.

00:02:41.555 --> 00:02:45.082
She's now five and through her glorious existence,

00:02:45.082 --> 00:02:48.127
I suppose I have now become a fully paid-up member

00:02:48.127 --> 00:02:53.573
of the amazing, dizzyingly wonderful disabled community.

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:55.714
And I find myself looking at the Paralympics

00:02:55.714 --> 00:02:58.208
and thinking what an incredible model that is!

00:02:58.208 --> 00:03:01.275
It's taken a good five decades actually,

00:03:01.275 --> 00:03:03.146
but I can say with hand on heart

00:03:03.146 --> 00:03:05.356
that when the Paralympics comes to London next year,

00:03:05.356 --> 00:03:09.527
there will not be any intelligent person anywhere on the planet

00:03:09.527 --> 00:03:16.241
who does not absolutely believe in the validity of disabled sportspeople.

00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:18.596
What an amazing position to be in!

00:03:18.596 --> 00:03:21.929
So, ladies and gentlemen, where the hell is music in all this?

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:24.646
Apologies to any of you who are sports fans,

00:03:24.646 --> 00:03:27.962
but music is far more universal than sport.

00:03:27.962 --> 00:03:31.111
Where is the platform? Where is their voice?

00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:35.446
So, we, in the UK, are at the very early stages

00:03:35.446 --> 00:03:37.743
in forming what will be Britain's first ever

00:03:37.743 --> 00:03:40.747
national disabled orchestra.

00:03:40.747 --> 00:03:42.985
We are going to call it the British Paraorchestra

00:03:42.985 --> 00:03:45.841
because with the world's eyes on London next year

00:03:45.841 --> 00:03:48.030
and particularly on the Paralympics

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.731
we want to throw down the gauntlet

00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:52.629
to every single other country that is represented there,

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.480
to say to them, "Here is our Paraorchestra, where is yours?"

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.253
Every country should have a multiplicity of paraorchestras

00:04:01.253 --> 00:04:04.446
of all shapes and sizes, no question.

00:04:04.446 --> 00:04:07.054
Now today is a very special day for me

00:04:07.054 --> 00:04:10.562
because it is the first time that the first four members

00:04:10.562 --> 00:04:13.308
of my little embryonic paraorchestra

00:04:13.308 --> 00:04:15.423
are going to play in public.

00:04:15.423 --> 00:04:20.308
Four extraordinary musicians of which the number will grow and grow.

00:04:20.308 --> 00:04:24.208
I hope in the end the paraorchestra could even be as big as 50 musicians.

00:04:24.208 --> 00:04:27.580
We present you today a little sonic adventure,

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.365
a little piece of improvisational whimsy, if you like,

00:04:31.365 --> 00:04:34.748
a piece on which, of course, the ink is still wet,

00:04:34.748 --> 00:04:36.099
the clay is still wet.

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.485
After all, improvisation is never a fixed thing.

00:04:38.485 --> 00:04:40.686
We decided what we wanted to share with you,

00:04:40.686 --> 00:04:42.332
at the heart of our improvisation,

00:04:42.332 --> 00:04:45.331
was a tune which is beloved of British people.

00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:47.179
It's one of the only folk melodies

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:49.431
that we still recognize in our culture.

00:04:49.431 --> 00:04:51.357
And here's an interesting thing:

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:53.115
folk music can tell you an awful lot

00:04:53.115 --> 00:04:56.867
about the cultural DNA of the country from which it originates.

00:04:56.867 --> 00:05:00.765
You see, we in Britain are quietly melancholic.

00:05:00.765 --> 00:05:04.839
You know the rain, it does rain, the food's not so good.

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:11.070
Quietly melancholic. Not blackly so, just quietly so.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.983
And as Shakespeare put it so brilliantly in "Twelfth Night",

00:05:13.983 --> 00:05:18.034
he loves music that has "a dying fall".

00:05:18.034 --> 00:05:23.218
So this melody, "Green Sleeves", is chock-full of "dying fall".

00:05:23.218 --> 00:05:24.073
You may know this tune.

00:05:24.073 --> 00:05:28.015
(Singing) Ta, ra. ra. ra ra, ra... dying fall.

00:05:28.015 --> 00:05:31.003
Ta, ra. ra. ra ra, ra... dying fall.

00:05:31.003 --> 00:05:33.972
Ta, ree, ra, ra, ra, ra ... dying fall.

00:05:33.972 --> 00:05:36.634
Brief bursts of sunshine, ladies and gentlemen, the chorus.

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:45.728
(Singing)

00:05:46.314 --> 00:05:47.507
Okay?

00:05:47.507 --> 00:05:51.035
It's like we need some melodic Viagra in our culture, ladies and gentlemen.

00:05:51.035 --> 00:05:54.014
(Laughter)

00:05:54.014 --> 00:05:59.550
(Applause)

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.337
It goes without saying that we are very much

00:06:01.337 --> 00:06:03.593
at the starting gates with this project.

00:06:03.593 --> 00:06:06.360
We need your help, we need the global community

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.725
to help us deliver this dream,

00:06:08.725 --> 00:06:11.399
so that this orchestra can be full steam ahead

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:14.160
by summer 2012.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.802
If you think that there is any way that you can help us,

00:06:15.802 --> 00:06:18.609
please, please, get in touch.

00:06:18.609 --> 00:06:22.336
And so ladies and gentlemen, it gives me enormous pride, pleasure and joy

00:06:22.336 --> 00:06:25.451
to introduce to you, with a short improvization

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:28.009
upon that most melancholic tune, "Green Sleeves",

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:31.691
the first four members of the British Paraorchestra.

00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:41.275
(Applause) (Cheers)

00:06:43.870 --> 00:12:58.996
(Music)

00:12:58.996 --> 00:13:08.076
(Applause)

00:13:08.922 --> 00:13:16.273
(Cheers) (Applause)
