00:00:12.815 --> 00:00:14.867
So, a little while ago,

00:00:14.891 --> 00:00:17.934
members of my family
had three bits of minor surgery,

00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:19.523
about a half hour each,

00:00:19.547 --> 00:00:21.624
and we got three sets of bills.

00:00:22.011 --> 00:00:26.237
For the first one, the anesthesia bill
alone was 2,000 dollars;

00:00:26.261 --> 00:00:28.641
the second one, 2,000 dollars;

00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:31.434
the third one, 6,000 dollars.

00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:36.189
So I'm a journalist.
I'm like, what's up with that?

00:00:37.022 --> 00:00:40.096
I found out that I was actually,
for the expensive one,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.939
being charged 1,419 dollars
for a generic anti-nausea drug

00:00:45.963 --> 00:00:49.516
that I could buy online
for two dollars and forty-nine cents.

00:00:50.782 --> 00:00:53.897
I had a long and unsatisfactory
argument with the hospital,

00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:56.521
the insurer and my employer.

00:00:56.545 --> 00:00:59.334
Everybody agreed
that this was totally fine.

00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:03.518
But it got me thinking, and the more
I talked to people, the more I realized:

00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:06.249
nobody has any idea
what stuff costs in health care.

00:01:06.273 --> 00:01:09.359
Not before, during or after
that procedure or test

00:01:09.383 --> 00:01:11.659
do you have any idea
what it's going to cost.

00:01:11.683 --> 00:01:15.118
It's only months later that you get
an "explanation of benefits"

00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:17.299
that explains exactly nothing.

00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:20.405
So this came back to me
a little while later.

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:23.035
I had volunteered for a buyout
from the New York Times,

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:25.892
where I had worked for more than
20 years as a journalist.

00:01:26.254 --> 00:01:28.347
I was looking for my next act.

00:01:28.705 --> 00:01:31.350
It turned out that next act
was to build a company

00:01:31.374 --> 00:01:33.750
telling people what stuff costs
in health care.

00:01:34.128 --> 00:01:37.434
I won a "Shark Tank"-type
pitch contest to do just that.

00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:42.098
Health costs ate up almost 18 percent
of our gross domestic product last year,

00:01:42.122 --> 00:01:44.835
but nobody has any idea what stuff costs.

00:01:45.225 --> 00:01:46.907
But what if we did know?

00:01:48.145 --> 00:01:49.804
So we started out small.

00:01:49.828 --> 00:01:51.573
We called doctors and hospitals

00:01:51.597 --> 00:01:56.090
and asked them what they would accept
as a cash payment for simple procedures.

00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:58.865
Some people were helpful.

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:00.742
A lot of people hung up on us.

00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:02.877
Some people were just plain rude.

00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:04.823
They said, "We don't know,"

00:02:04.847 --> 00:02:07.389
or, "Our lawyers won't
let us tell you that,"

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.773
though we did get a lot of information.

00:02:10.207 --> 00:02:12.881
We found, for example,
that here in the New York area,

00:02:12.905 --> 00:02:16.995
you could get an echocardiogram
for 200 dollars in Brooklyn

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.989
or for 2,150 dollars in Manhattan,
just a few miles away.

00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:25.480
New Orleans, the same simple blood test,

00:02:25.504 --> 00:02:27.776
19 dollars over here,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.005
522 dollars just a few blocks away.

00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:34.470
San Francisco, the same MRI,

00:02:34.494 --> 00:02:36.811
475 dollars

00:02:36.835 --> 00:02:41.695
or 6,221 dollars just 25 miles away.

00:02:42.822 --> 00:02:46.090
These pricing variations existed
for all the procedures

00:02:46.114 --> 00:02:48.159
and all the cities that we surveyed.

00:02:49.165 --> 00:02:52.018
Then we started to ask people
to tell us their health bills.

00:02:52.512 --> 00:02:56.265
In partnership with public radio station
WNYC here in New York,

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.221
we asked women to tell us
the prices of their mammograms.

00:02:59.624 --> 00:03:02.903
People told us nobody would do that,
that it was too personal.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.269
But in the space of three weeks,

00:03:05.293 --> 00:03:08.464
400 women told us about their prices.

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:12.356
Then we started to make it easier
for people to share their data

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.082
into our online searchable database.

00:03:15.106 --> 00:03:20.244
It's sort of like a mash-up of Kayak.com
and the Waze traffic app for health care.

00:03:20.268 --> 00:03:21.317
(Laughter)

00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:24.248
We call it a community-created
guide to health costs.

00:03:24.272 --> 00:03:26.907
Our survey and crowdsourcing work
grew into partnerships

00:03:26.931 --> 00:03:28.797
with top newsrooms nationwide --

00:03:28.821 --> 00:03:30.893
in New Orleans, Philadelphia,

00:03:30.917 --> 00:03:34.628
San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Miami and other places.

00:03:35.212 --> 00:03:39.135
We used the data to tell stories
about people who were suffering

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.979
and how to avoid that suffering,
to avoid that "gotcha" bill.

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.421
A woman in New Orleans saved
nearly 4,000 dollars using our data.

00:03:49.147 --> 00:03:52.458
A San Francisco contributor
saved nearly 1,300 dollars

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.283
by putting away his insurance card

00:03:54.307 --> 00:03:55.757
and paying cash.

00:03:56.513 --> 00:03:59.541
There are a lot of people
who are going to in-network hospitals

00:03:59.565 --> 00:04:01.194
and getting out-of-network bills.

00:04:01.838 --> 00:04:05.047
And then there was the hospital
that continued to bill a dead man.

00:04:05.071 --> 00:04:08.223
We learned that thousands of people
wanted to tell us their prices.

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:09.976
They want to learn what stuff costs,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.634
find out how to argue a bill,

00:04:11.658 --> 00:04:15.928
help us solve this problem that's hurting
them and their friends and families.

00:04:15.952 --> 00:04:18.928
We talked to people who had
to sell a car to pay a health bill,

00:04:18.952 --> 00:04:20.339
go into bankruptcy,

00:04:20.363 --> 00:04:22.636
skip a treatment because of the cost.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.890
Imagine if you could afford the diagnosis

00:04:25.914 --> 00:04:27.430
but not the cure.

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:31.751
We set off a huge conversation about costs

00:04:31.775 --> 00:04:35.526
involving doctors and hospitals, yes,
but also their patients,

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.741
or as we like to call them, people.

00:04:37.765 --> 00:04:39.669
(Laughter)

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:42.670
We changed policy.

00:04:42.694 --> 00:04:45.020
A consumer protection bill
that had been stalled

00:04:45.044 --> 00:04:47.167
in the Louisiana legislature for 10 years

00:04:47.191 --> 00:04:49.033
passed after we launched.

00:04:50.797 --> 00:04:51.948
Let's face it:

00:04:51.972 --> 00:04:54.367
this huge, slow-rolling
public health crisis

00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:56.258
is a national emergency.

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:59.795
And I don't think government's
going to help us out anytime soon.

00:05:00.652 --> 00:05:02.800
But what if the answer was really simple:

00:05:02.824 --> 00:05:05.844
make all the prices public all the time.

00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:10.271
Would our individual bills go down?
Our health premiums?

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:13.471
Be really clear about this:

00:05:13.495 --> 00:05:15.405
this is a United States problem.

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:17.484
In most of the rest
of the developed world,

00:05:17.508 --> 00:05:20.267
sick people don't have
to worry about money.

00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:24.309
It's also true that price transparency
will not solve every problem.

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:27.139
There will still be expensive treatments,

00:05:27.163 --> 00:05:29.855
huge friction from our insurance system.

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:31.559
There will still be fraud

00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:34.954
and a massive problem
with overtreatment and overdiagnosis.

00:05:35.537 --> 00:05:38.152
And not everything is shoppable.

00:05:38.176 --> 00:05:40.630
Not everybody wants
the cheapest appendectomy

00:05:40.654 --> 00:05:42.505
or the cheapest cancer care.

00:05:43.513 --> 00:05:45.668
But when we talk
about these clear effects,

00:05:45.692 --> 00:05:49.219
we're looking at a real issue
that's actually very simple.

00:05:50.394 --> 00:05:52.348
When we first started calling for prices,

00:05:52.372 --> 00:05:54.851
we actually felt like
we were going to be arrested.

00:05:55.162 --> 00:05:58.754
It seemed kind of transgressive
to talk about medicine and health care

00:05:58.778 --> 00:06:00.123
in the same breath,

00:06:00.147 --> 00:06:01.699
and yet it became liberating,

00:06:01.723 --> 00:06:04.035
because we found not only data

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:06.700
but also good and honest people
out there in the system

00:06:06.724 --> 00:06:08.868
who want to help folks
get the care they need

00:06:08.892 --> 00:06:10.310
at a price they can afford.

00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:13.506
And it got easier to ask.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:15.611
So I'll leave you with some questions.

00:06:15.635 --> 00:06:18.964
What if we all knew what stuff cost
in health care in advance?

00:06:19.983 --> 00:06:23.170
What if, every time
you Googled for an MRI,

00:06:23.194 --> 00:06:26.594
you got drop-downs telling you
where to buy and for how much,

00:06:26.618 --> 00:06:29.075
the way you do when
you Google for a laser printer?

00:06:30.094 --> 00:06:34.338
What if all of the time and energy
and money that's spent hiding prices

00:06:34.362 --> 00:06:36.346
was squeezed out of the system?

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:40.387
What if each one of us could pick
the $19 test every time

00:06:40.411 --> 00:06:42.748
instead of the $522 one?

00:06:43.384 --> 00:06:45.122
Would our individual bills go down?

00:06:45.146 --> 00:06:46.549
Our premiums?

00:06:46.573 --> 00:06:49.421
I don't know, but if you don't ask,
you'll never know.

00:06:49.445 --> 00:06:51.315
And you might save a ton of money.

00:06:51.767 --> 00:06:55.306
And I've got to think that a lot of us
and the system itself

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.912
would be a lot healthier.

00:06:57.676 --> 00:06:58.864
Thank you.

00:06:58.888 --> 00:07:02.716
(Applause)
