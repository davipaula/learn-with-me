00:00:10.898 --> 00:00:12.372
Hello everybody.

00:00:12.377 --> 00:00:13.758
Audience: Hello.

00:00:13.762 --> 00:00:16.707
Keith Lowe: Fantastic! This is
like a schoolroom or something.

00:00:16.714 --> 00:00:17.738
(Laughter)

00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:19.759
My name is Keith Lowe.

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.005
I am an historian
of the Second World War

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.010
and its aftermath,

00:00:24.078 --> 00:00:26.539
and even I have to admit

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.109
that I've chosen
a pretty crowded field to study.

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.849
I went into my local bookshop recently,

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:37.338
and this is what I saw.

00:00:38.827 --> 00:00:42.195
Thousands of books
about the Second World War

00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:43.932
are published every year,

00:00:43.932 --> 00:00:45.971
and, actually, to tell you the truth,

00:00:45.971 --> 00:00:49.519
this is only a very tiny selection
of what's on offer.

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.229
We in the West,

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.539
and, actually, increasingly people
in other parts of the world too,

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.370
we are just a little bit obsessed
by the Second World War.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.632
We have whole TV stations
which seem devoted to it.

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:09.231
We write books about it,
we write novels about it,

00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:11.179
we make films about it.

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:16.040
We have university courses
which are devoted to the Second World War.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.052
Whole museums are built
to house World War II collections.

00:01:22.372 --> 00:01:25.441
Even our politicians
like to get in on this act.

00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:30.041
Whenever there is
an important anniversary of the war,

00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:32.651
they tend to gather and commemorate it,

00:01:32.651 --> 00:01:33.922
and make speeches.

00:01:34.543 --> 00:01:39.993
So, for example, at the 70th anniversary
of the D-Day landings,

00:01:39.993 --> 00:01:41.910
June 2014,

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.151
17 heads of state took time out
of their schedules

00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:49.571
to come and spend the day
on the Normandy beaches.

00:01:49.571 --> 00:01:51.182
Seventeen!

00:01:51.182 --> 00:01:55.862
This included people
like Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin,

00:01:55.862 --> 00:01:59.684
the chancellor of Germany,
Angela Merkel, and so on.

00:01:59.684 --> 00:02:01.676
From my own country,

00:02:01.703 --> 00:02:06.564
we sent not only our Prime Minister,
but also Queen Elisabeth II,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.172
who is - I mean, she is now
in her nineties

00:02:09.172 --> 00:02:11.381
and largely retired from public life.

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:17.983
What other international event
can do all this?

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:20.964
Even international summits struggle

00:02:20.977 --> 00:02:25.162
to get so many world leaders
into one place at the same time.

00:02:26.072 --> 00:02:28.193
My question is: Why?

00:02:28.903 --> 00:02:33.453
What is it that all these world leaders,
in fact what is it that all of us,

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:36.254
think it is that we're remembering?

00:02:36.254 --> 00:02:39.255
Why are we all so obsessed
by the the Second World War?

00:02:42.445 --> 00:02:44.293
You might think that somebody like me

00:02:44.293 --> 00:02:46.603
would be pretty pleased
with this situation.

00:02:47.563 --> 00:02:50.281
As long as the World War II
industry is booming,

00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:52.584
I am always going to have a job, right?

00:02:53.354 --> 00:02:56.004
But actually there is something about it

00:02:56.694 --> 00:02:59.953
that I find really
a little bit disturbing,

00:02:59.953 --> 00:03:02.264
and I don't know
whether that is just because

00:03:02.264 --> 00:03:05.583
I have an inherent distrust
of a lot of politicians,

00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:10.583
or whether it's because I've been trained
to always question everything.

00:03:11.903 --> 00:03:14.693
But it strikes me
that a lot of the rhetoric

00:03:14.693 --> 00:03:18.245
that gets thrown around
about the Second World War,

00:03:18.245 --> 00:03:23.185
particularly by people like politicians
and journalists and diplomats and so on,

00:03:23.522 --> 00:03:27.555
a lot of it doesn't seem to be
about the Second World War at all;

00:03:28.088 --> 00:03:30.194
it seems to be about something else.

00:03:31.524 --> 00:03:36.035
I'm not sure if I've exactly put my finger
on precisely what that thing is,

00:03:36.035 --> 00:03:40.996
but it seems to be something like a way
of fostering national pride,

00:03:41.816 --> 00:03:45.894
or just trying to get people
to feel good about themselves.

00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:55.633
Along the way, it seems to me

00:03:55.646 --> 00:04:00.137
that the Second World War has been
turned into a little bit of a cartoon,

00:04:00.137 --> 00:04:03.033
where everybody knows
who the good guys were,

00:04:03.033 --> 00:04:05.105
and everybody knows who the bad guys were.

00:04:05.105 --> 00:04:07.445
There is precious little
space left anymore

00:04:07.457 --> 00:04:11.605
for any of that difficult
grey area in between.

00:04:13.745 --> 00:04:15.366
To give you some kind of an idea

00:04:15.366 --> 00:04:18.377
about what on earth it is
I am going on about,

00:04:18.377 --> 00:04:22.696
let me tell you a story
from my own country, from Britain.

00:04:22.696 --> 00:04:24.508
In Britain, we like to think

00:04:24.508 --> 00:04:28.125
we are the real heroes
of the Second World War.

00:04:28.795 --> 00:04:33.144
We tell stories about
how we stood alone against the Nazis,

00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:36.219
about how we endured
the bombing of the Blitz;

00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:38.711
how we kept calm and carried on,

00:04:38.722 --> 00:04:42.721
and eventually fought
our way back into Europe

00:04:42.742 --> 00:04:44.245
and liberated it.

00:04:44.568 --> 00:04:46.462
We still call the Second World War

00:04:46.471 --> 00:04:48.252
"Our Finest Hour",

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.978
as if it is some kind
of golden age in our history.

00:04:51.841 --> 00:04:54.935
So whenever there is
any kind of anniversary,

00:04:54.955 --> 00:04:58.537
or important event based
around the Second World War,

00:04:58.537 --> 00:05:00.268
we Brits really go for it.

00:05:01.863 --> 00:05:06.463
One of these events happened
quite recently, in the summer of 2012,

00:05:06.476 --> 00:05:09.988
when we opened up a brand new war memorial

00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:12.253
right in the middle of central London.

00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:15.729
It was a memorial
to the men of Bomber Command,

00:05:15.744 --> 00:05:19.932
the men who flew the planes over Germany,
dropped bombs and so on.

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:24.617
This is what it looks like.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.446
As you can see, it's not exactly
a shy and retiring piece of architecture,

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:31.941
it's actually quite huge.

00:05:32.896 --> 00:05:37.117
It's by far the largest war memorial
that we have in London,

00:05:37.117 --> 00:05:40.709
and I can tell you there are
a lot of war memorials in London.

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:43.004
As you walk into this thing,

00:05:43.008 --> 00:05:45.288
there is an inscription which tells you

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:50.987
that it's dedicated
to the 55,000 men of Bomber Command

00:05:50.987 --> 00:05:54.618
who lost their lives during World War II.

00:05:54.618 --> 00:05:58.218
Now, when this first opened,
in the summer of 2012,

00:05:58.218 --> 00:06:00.909
I went along to have a look,
see what I thought of it,

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:02.540
have a walk around.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.779
There is something
really quite moving about it actually.

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.969
You step in through
these great big pillars,

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:15.569
and, up on the wall,
you can see carved into the stone,

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:19.251
there is a quotation
from Winston Churchill

00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:24.630
saying exactly how much we owe
to these men who lost their lives.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:30.240
Parts of the memorial are built
out of an actual World War II aircraft

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.392
that was shot down during the war.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.141
So they put a lot of thought into this.

00:06:35.141 --> 00:06:37.079
It's actually really quite inspiring.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.210
So as I was walking around this monument,

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:46.521
I couldn't help but feel
this real surge of pride.

00:06:48.121 --> 00:06:50.030
I felt proud of these men

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.299
who had given their lives
for something that I hold dear.

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:56.581
I felt proud of my country,

00:06:57.551 --> 00:07:03.322
I felt proud of the British way of life
which had produced heroes like this.

00:07:05.247 --> 00:07:06.655
And yet,

00:07:07.631 --> 00:07:12.502
there was this little voice
in the back of my head

00:07:12.502 --> 00:07:14.223
which just wouldn't go away

00:07:15.464 --> 00:07:19.839
because I know that 55,000 men
of Bomber Command

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:22.045
died during World War II,

00:07:22.051 --> 00:07:26.080
but I also know that 500,000 Germans

00:07:26.093 --> 00:07:29.601
died beneath the bombs
that these men dropped.

00:07:30.571 --> 00:07:33.542
A lot of those Germans were Nazis,

00:07:33.542 --> 00:07:37.133
and I dare say that a lot of them
probably deserved it.

00:07:38.963 --> 00:07:42.363
But the vast majority of these people

00:07:42.363 --> 00:07:45.824
were just ordinary men, women
and children, just like you and me.

00:07:46.779 --> 00:07:51.792
Are any of these people at all
mentioned on this memorial?

00:07:52.442 --> 00:07:55.062
Of course they are not.

00:07:55.062 --> 00:07:58.653
If you would suggest such a thing
in the summer of 2012,

00:07:58.653 --> 00:08:00.863
you probably would have been lynched.

00:08:00.863 --> 00:08:04.504
The Germans were our enemies
during the Second World War.

00:08:04.504 --> 00:08:08.212
You can't mention the Germans
on a British national monument.

00:08:10.312 --> 00:08:12.323
And yet not to mention them,

00:08:13.053 --> 00:08:16.013
to pretend that somehow
this didn't happen,

00:08:16.693 --> 00:08:20.104
or even worse, that somehow
it doesn't matter,

00:08:21.704 --> 00:08:24.174
that too makes me feel
a little bit uncomfortable.

00:08:25.419 --> 00:08:27.995
Okay, the Germans are a difficult problem,

00:08:27.995 --> 00:08:30.880
so let's just put them
to one side for a minute,

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:33.804
and let's think instead about
the other nationalities.

00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:36.393
And here is where the story
starts getting interesting.

00:08:36.393 --> 00:08:37.783
Because if there is one thing

00:08:37.783 --> 00:08:41.485
that we Brits always forget about
the bomber war,

00:08:41.514 --> 00:08:44.332
it's the fact that we didn't
only bomb Germany.

00:08:45.154 --> 00:08:50.755
More than a third of British and American
bombs dropped on Europe during the war

00:08:50.758 --> 00:08:52.350
were dropped not on Germany

00:08:52.354 --> 00:08:55.748
but on those countries
we were supposed to be liberating.

00:08:57.095 --> 00:08:59.043
As a consequence,

00:08:59.043 --> 00:09:03.835
50,000 French civilians
were killed by our bombs.

00:09:05.245 --> 00:09:09.516
10,000 Dutch civilians
were killed by our bombs.

00:09:12.026 --> 00:09:14.456
Are any of these people
mentioned on this memorial?

00:09:15.846 --> 00:09:17.335
Of course they're not.

00:09:18.037 --> 00:09:21.079
And it was while I was thinking
about that particular group,

00:09:21.088 --> 00:09:24.374
that it finally dawned on me -

00:09:24.374 --> 00:09:27.926
actually something I probably should
have realized right from the start -

00:09:27.926 --> 00:09:32.896
which is that memorials like this
aren't designed to tell the whole story;

00:09:34.066 --> 00:09:37.288
they are only designed
to tell those parts of the story

00:09:37.288 --> 00:09:40.647
that make British people
feel good about themselves.

00:09:42.142 --> 00:09:44.051
That's all very well and good,

00:09:44.985 --> 00:09:47.702
but it does come at a cost.

00:09:48.517 --> 00:09:51.956
And I couldn't help thinking
when I was walking around this thing:

00:09:51.956 --> 00:09:54.307
This was the summer of 2012,

00:09:54.317 --> 00:09:55.878
this was the summer

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:59.429
when the Olympic Games
was coming to London.

00:09:59.438 --> 00:10:01.136
So at exactly the moment

00:10:01.136 --> 00:10:04.108
when the entire world
was arriving in our city,

00:10:04.108 --> 00:10:06.047
the message that we were advertising

00:10:06.047 --> 00:10:09.667
was that we will remember
our wartime dead,

00:10:09.667 --> 00:10:11.598
but we won't remember yours.

00:10:12.358 --> 00:10:15.448
It's like the exact opposite
of the Olympic spirit.

00:10:17.908 --> 00:10:21.327
It's not only the British who do this,
of course it's not.

00:10:21.327 --> 00:10:22.968
Every nation does it,

00:10:24.368 --> 00:10:26.567
the Americans, for example.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.769
The Americans like to call
their wartime veterans

00:10:29.777 --> 00:10:35.024
"the greatest generation
that any society has ever produced",

00:10:35.024 --> 00:10:38.756
as if they have some kind of monopoly
on heroism or something.

00:10:38.756 --> 00:10:39.807
(Laughter)

00:10:39.807 --> 00:10:42.869
They backed it up
with a thousand Hollywood movies

00:10:42.869 --> 00:10:45.167
full of square-jawed American heroes

00:10:45.167 --> 00:10:48.229
defeating evil in the name
of truth and freedom.

00:10:50.239 --> 00:10:51.634
The Chinese are the same.

00:10:52.524 --> 00:10:56.328
You know that in 2013 alone,

00:10:56.328 --> 00:11:01.359
Chinese TV companies produced
over 200 TV dramatizations

00:11:01.359 --> 00:11:02.895
about the Second World War,

00:11:02.901 --> 00:11:05.936
each of them telling
almost an identical story.

00:11:06.419 --> 00:11:07.937
Only, of course, this time,

00:11:07.952 --> 00:11:11.890
it's the Japanese
who are all the evil monsters,

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:14.799
and the Chinese
who are all selfless heroes.

00:11:16.119 --> 00:11:19.680
And, of course, I could say
the same thing about the French

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.221
or the Koreans or the Norwegians
or the Greeks.

00:11:24.161 --> 00:11:25.539
We all do this.

00:11:26.379 --> 00:11:29.611
We all like to think
that we were the heroes.

00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:34.876
We all like to think
that we were the victims.

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:39.918
But what we don't like to remember
is those grey areas.

00:11:40.081 --> 00:11:44.039
And it's that which I find
most uncomfortable about this,

00:11:44.039 --> 00:11:46.217
because, as far as I am concerned,

00:11:46.217 --> 00:11:48.971
it's the grey areas
that make history interesting.

00:11:49.711 --> 00:11:53.482
In a sense, all good history
is about the grey areas.

00:11:54.632 --> 00:11:57.430
But a lot of people
don't seem to have time

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.861
for complicated stories.

00:12:00.661 --> 00:12:05.420
They don't have time for difficult
and uncomfortable emotions.

00:12:06.508 --> 00:12:10.330
In fact, I'm quickly coming
to the conclusion

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:14.820
that a lot of people
don't really have time for history at all.

00:12:14.833 --> 00:12:17.756
What they really want is a myth.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.950
Now, you might ask yourselves:

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.691
What does any of this matter?

00:12:24.691 --> 00:12:26.801
I mean, we all like
a good story, don't we?

00:12:27.659 --> 00:12:30.020
If that story makes us feel
good about ourselves,

00:12:30.028 --> 00:12:31.790
then so much the better.

00:12:31.803 --> 00:12:35.037
It's all in the past anyway,
so what does it matter?

00:12:36.073 --> 00:12:37.982
But that's just the problem, isn't it?

00:12:37.982 --> 00:12:39.833
Because it's not all in the past.

00:12:39.833 --> 00:12:43.511
And there is a dark side
to all of these stories and myths

00:12:43.511 --> 00:12:45.232
that can be really damaging.

00:12:46.602 --> 00:12:51.823
When the former Yugoslavia
tore itself apart in the 1990s,

00:12:51.823 --> 00:12:55.673
it did so with World War II
songs on its lips,

00:12:55.673 --> 00:12:58.063
and World War II atrocities in its heart.

00:12:59.287 --> 00:13:03.011
When the Ukraine crisis broke out in 2014,

00:13:03.011 --> 00:13:08.324
Ukrainians and Russians accused
one another of acting like Nazis.

00:13:09.234 --> 00:13:11.438
And then, of course,
Hillary Clinton weighed in

00:13:11.438 --> 00:13:13.971
and started comparing
Vladimir Putin to Hitler.

00:13:14.741 --> 00:13:17.415
These sorts of comparisons

00:13:17.415 --> 00:13:20.983
don't do anything
to foster rational debate.

00:13:21.005 --> 00:13:23.620
If you were in an argument with someone,

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.090
the last thing that is going
to calm things down

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:28.444
is that you start accusing them
of being a Nazi.

00:13:29.494 --> 00:13:30.823
If you don't believe me,

00:13:30.823 --> 00:13:33.823
next time you're in an argument
with your wife or your husband,

00:13:33.823 --> 00:13:36.272
give it a try and see
what kind of reaction you get.

00:13:36.272 --> 00:13:37.984
(Laughter)

00:13:37.984 --> 00:13:40.536
I can see some of you
seem to have tried it.

00:13:40.541 --> 00:13:41.774
(Laughter)

00:13:41.786 --> 00:13:46.744
My point is that as soon as we start
bringing the Second World War

00:13:46.744 --> 00:13:48.734
into any of our arguments,

00:13:48.734 --> 00:13:52.224
we get so sort of carried away
with our own national myths

00:13:54.554 --> 00:13:58.014
that all we actually end up doing
is stirring things back up again.

00:13:58.959 --> 00:14:01.358
Let me give you a couple of examples.

00:14:01.364 --> 00:14:06.195
Take this economic crisis
which has rocked the world since 2008.

00:14:06.213 --> 00:14:10.633
Here we are in Athens, and you all know
about the economic crisis.

00:14:10.904 --> 00:14:12.665
All across Southern Europe,

00:14:12.665 --> 00:14:16.405
people have been suffering
a real austerity,

00:14:16.405 --> 00:14:21.545
and largely this has been imposed
by the European Union.

00:14:21.545 --> 00:14:26.185
But it's not always the European Union
that gets the blame for this.

00:14:26.185 --> 00:14:30.625
Quite often, as the largest
and most powerful country in the union,

00:14:30.625 --> 00:14:32.735
it's Germany that gets the blame.

00:14:33.727 --> 00:14:36.566
Now, how has this been
portrayed in the press?

00:14:36.578 --> 00:14:41.490
Have we had a calm, rational
economic debate about it?

00:14:43.356 --> 00:14:48.606
This is the way that the Italian press
portrayed the situation in 2012:

00:14:49.936 --> 00:14:51.410
"Quarto Reich."

00:14:51.419 --> 00:14:52.477
(Laughter)

00:14:52.483 --> 00:14:53.935
"The Fourth Reich."

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:55.787
This is the Italian way of saying

00:14:55.787 --> 00:14:59.577
that modern-day Germany
is no better than the Nazis,

00:14:59.995 --> 00:15:03.976
as if there is a direct link
between World War II and today.

00:15:04.696 --> 00:15:06.245
And take a look at that picture.

00:15:06.245 --> 00:15:08.525
They've managed to dig something out

00:15:08.525 --> 00:15:11.494
that makes it look like Angela Merkel
is making a Nazi salute.

00:15:11.504 --> 00:15:13.265
(Laughter)

00:15:13.265 --> 00:15:15.442
How about the Greek press?

00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:16.535
(Laughter)

00:15:16.559 --> 00:15:18.636
How have the Greeks portrayed it?

00:15:18.636 --> 00:15:20.183
Well, here is a Greek newspaper.

00:15:20.194 --> 00:15:21.243
(Laughter)

00:15:21.255 --> 00:15:23.206
from the same year,

00:15:24.461 --> 00:15:25.538
2012,

00:15:25.544 --> 00:15:30.124
and you will notice a photograph
of Angela Merkel once again,

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.365
this time in a Nazi uniform.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.287
Obviously, it has been photoshopped.

00:15:36.179 --> 00:15:38.732
But what about that headline in red?

00:15:38.752 --> 00:15:41.066
"Memorandum macht frei."

00:15:41.069 --> 00:15:44.619
This is a direct reference to the motto

00:15:44.625 --> 00:15:47.526
that was written above the gates
of the concentration camps

00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:49.687
in places like Auschwitz and Dachau.

00:15:50.557 --> 00:15:53.908
The implication here
is that the whole of Greece

00:15:53.908 --> 00:15:57.718
is going to become like one giant
German concentration camp

00:15:57.718 --> 00:16:01.127
as a consequence of the economic deal
they've had to do.

00:16:02.104 --> 00:16:05.751
Now, this is the sort of thing
that makes an historian like me

00:16:05.757 --> 00:16:09.653
want to just give up and go and become
a window cleaner or something.

00:16:09.679 --> 00:16:10.939
(Laughter)

00:16:10.963 --> 00:16:13.049
I mean, it's historical nonsense.

00:16:13.256 --> 00:16:17.833
None of these headlines have anything
to do with the Second World War at all.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:22.420
They are about a modern-day problem,
a modern situation.

00:16:22.589 --> 00:16:25.757
The only reason to mention
the Second World War

00:16:25.757 --> 00:16:29.358
is to provoke an emotional response.

00:16:30.918 --> 00:16:35.549
If I have one message that I want you
to take away with you today, it is this:

00:16:35.549 --> 00:16:40.120
Whenever you hear a politician,
or a journalist, or a diplomat,

00:16:40.125 --> 00:16:42.080
mention the Second World War,

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.978
I want alarm bells to ring.

00:16:43.978 --> 00:16:47.871
Because when public figures
speak about the Second World War,

00:16:47.883 --> 00:16:50.843
they are not talking
about what actually happened,

00:16:50.848 --> 00:16:52.589
they're invoking a myth.

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.780
So whenever you hear
a politician mention the war,

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.501
I want you to ask yourselves

00:16:57.501 --> 00:16:59.771
what it is he is really trying to do.

00:16:59.798 --> 00:17:02.080
Is he trying to inspire you? -

00:17:02.089 --> 00:17:05.183
In which case
that is relatively harmless.

00:17:05.194 --> 00:17:08.428
Or is he trying to fill you with fear?

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.230
Is he trying to draw people together?

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:14.611
In which case, again,
that is relatively harmless.

00:17:15.391 --> 00:17:17.550
Or is he really trying
to drive people apart?

00:17:18.361 --> 00:17:21.131
And above all, I want you
to remind yourselves,

00:17:21.131 --> 00:17:23.550
and to remind everybody you know,

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.502
that the Second World War is over.

00:17:25.515 --> 00:17:26.510
(Laughter)

00:17:26.525 --> 00:17:28.609
We live in a different world,

00:17:28.621 --> 00:17:32.441
with different values
and different problems.

00:17:32.441 --> 00:17:34.897
These problems will never be solved,

00:17:34.897 --> 00:17:37.890
and they certainly will never
be solved peacefully,

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:42.141
if all we can think to do
is to resurrect the Second World War.

00:17:44.111 --> 00:17:49.002
You know, history is a messy business,

00:17:49.002 --> 00:17:51.752
particularly the history
of the Second World War.

00:17:51.752 --> 00:17:56.532
It's not there to make us
feel good about ourselves;

00:17:56.532 --> 00:18:00.781
it's often ugly and uncomfortable,

00:18:00.781 --> 00:18:03.451
and desperately complicated.

00:18:03.451 --> 00:18:05.921
It's full of those grey areas.

00:18:06.535 --> 00:18:09.661
If we could all just learn to accept that,

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:14.673
then this world, our world,
would be a much more peaceful place.

00:18:15.873 --> 00:18:17.283
Thank you.

00:18:17.283 --> 00:18:19.914
(Applause)
