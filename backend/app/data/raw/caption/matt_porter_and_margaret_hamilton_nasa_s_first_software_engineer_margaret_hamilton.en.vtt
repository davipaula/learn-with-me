00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:11.290
At roughly 4pm on July 20, 1969,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.054
mankind was just minutes away 
from landing on the surface of the moon.

00:00:16.054 --> 00:00:18.734
But before the astronauts 
began their final descent,

00:00:18.734 --> 00:00:20.714
an emergency alarm lit up.

00:00:20.714 --> 00:00:22.804
Something was overloading 
the computer,

00:00:22.804 --> 00:00:25.504
and threatened to abort the landing.

00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:28.594
Back on Earth, Margaret Hamilton 
held her breath.

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:32.234
She'd led the team developing 
the pioneering in-flight software,

00:00:32.234 --> 00:00:35.164
so she knew this mission 
had no room for error.

00:00:35.164 --> 00:00:37.614
But the nature 
of this last-second emergency

00:00:37.614 --> 00:00:42.523
would soon prove her software 
was working exactly as planned.

00:00:42.523 --> 00:00:48.438
Born 33 years earlier in Paoli, Indiana, 
Hamilton had always been inquisitive.

00:00:48.438 --> 00:00:51.268
In college, she studied mathematics
and philosophy,

00:00:51.268 --> 00:00:55.598
before taking a research position at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology

00:00:55.598 --> 00:00:57.304
to pay for grad school.

00:00:57.304 --> 00:01:00.914
Here, she encountered her first computer
while developing software

00:01:00.914 --> 00:01:04.744
to support research 
into the new field of chaos theory.

00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:07.514
Next at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory,

00:01:07.514 --> 00:01:11.139
Hamilton developed software 
for America’s first air defense system

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:13.189
to search for enemy aircraft.

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.781
But when she heard 
that renowned engineer Charles Draper

00:01:16.781 --> 00:01:19.351
was looking for help 
sending mankind to the moon,

00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:22.152
she immediately joined his team.

00:01:22.152 --> 00:01:25.382
NASA looked to Draper and his group 
of over 400 engineers

00:01:25.382 --> 00:01:28.822
to invent the first compact 
digital flight computer,

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:31.112
the Apollo Guidance Computer.

00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:32.829
Using input from astronauts,

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.857
this device would be responsible 
for guiding, navigating

00:01:35.857 --> 00:01:38.371
and controlling the spacecraft.

00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:41.890
At a time when unreliable computers 
filled entire rooms,

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.452
the AGC needed to operate 
without any errors,

00:01:45.452 --> 00:01:48.982
and fit in one cubic foot of space.

00:01:48.982 --> 00:01:51.612
Draper divided the lab into two teams,

00:01:51.612 --> 00:01:55.405
one for designing hardware 
and one for developing software.

00:01:55.405 --> 00:01:58.505
Hamilton led the team that built 
the on-board flight software

00:01:58.505 --> 00:02:01.025
for both the Command and Lunar Modules.

00:02:01.025 --> 00:02:04.635
This work, for which she coined the term
“software engineering,"

00:02:04.635 --> 00:02:07.205
was incredibly high stakes.

00:02:07.205 --> 00:02:12.165
Human lives were on the line, 
so every program had to be perfect.

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:15.795
Margaret’s software needed to quickly
detect unexpected errors

00:02:15.795 --> 00:02:18.395
and recover from them in real time.

00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:21.725
But this kind of adaptable program 
was difficult to build,

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:25.943
since early software could only process 
jobs in a predetermined order.

00:02:25.943 --> 00:02:27.370
To solve this problem,

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.470
Margaret designed her program 
to be “asynchronous,”

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.662
meaning the software's more important
jobs would interrupt less important ones.

00:02:35.662 --> 00:02:38.862
Her team assigned every task 
a unique priority

00:02:38.862 --> 00:02:41.631
to ensure that each job 
occurred in the correct order

00:02:41.631 --> 00:02:45.951
and at the right time—
regardless of any surprises.

00:02:45.951 --> 00:02:47.461
After this breakthrough,

00:02:47.461 --> 00:02:50.521
Margaret realized her software 
could help the astronauts work

00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:53.031
in an asynchronous environment as well.

00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:54.559
She designed Priority Displays

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:57.369
that would interrupt 
astronaut’s regularly scheduled tasks

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:59.389
to warn them of emergencies.

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.119
The astronaut could then communicate
with Mission Control

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:04.789
to determine the best path forward.

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:08.789
This marked the first time flight software
communicated directly—

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:11.639
and asynchronously— 
with a pilot.

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:16.474
It was these fail safes that triggered 
the alarms just before the lunar landing.

00:03:16.474 --> 00:03:19.224
Buzz Aldrin quickly realized his mistake—

00:03:19.224 --> 00:03:22.864
he’d inadvertently flipped 
the rendezvous radar switch.

00:03:22.864 --> 00:03:25.351
This radar would be essential 
on their journey home,

00:03:25.351 --> 00:03:29.351
but here it was using up 
vital computational resources.

00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:34.240
Fortunately, the Apollo Guidance Computer
was well equipped to manage this.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.100
During the overload, 
the software restart programs

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.430
allowed only the highest priority jobs 
to be processed—

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.073
including the programs 
necessary for landing.

00:03:43.073 --> 00:03:46.392
The Priority Displays 
gave the astronauts a choice—

00:03:46.392 --> 00:03:48.942
to land or not to land.

00:03:48.942 --> 00:03:53.172
With minutes to spare, 
Mission Control gave the order.

00:03:53.172 --> 00:03:56.812
The Apollo 11 landing was about 
the astronauts, Mission Control,

00:03:56.812 --> 00:04:02.321
software and hardware all working together
as an integrated system of systems.

00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:06.598
Hamilton’s contributions were essential
to the work of engineers and scientists

00:04:06.598 --> 00:04:10.986
inspired by President John F. Kennedy’s 
goal to reach the Moon.

00:04:10.986 --> 00:04:14.366
And her life-saving work 
went far beyond Apollo 11—

00:04:14.366 --> 00:04:20.258
no bugs were ever found in the in-flight
software for any crewed Apollo missions.

00:04:20.258 --> 00:04:22.108
After her work on Apollo,

00:04:22.108 --> 00:04:26.322
Hamilton founded a company that uses 
its unique universal systems language

00:04:26.322 --> 00:04:29.393
to create breakthroughs 
for systems and software.

00:04:29.393 --> 00:04:34.435
In 2003, NASA honored her achievements 
with the largest financial award

00:04:34.435 --> 00:04:36.945
they’d ever given to an individual.

00:04:36.945 --> 00:04:41.836
And 47 years after her software
first guided astronauts to the moon,

00:04:41.836 --> 00:04:45.336
Hamilton was awarded 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom

00:04:45.336 --> 00:04:48.406
for changing the way we think 
about technology.
