00:00:13.037 --> 00:00:17.418
It was my third day on the job
at a hot Silicon Valley start-up

00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:19.441
in early 2013.

00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:24.329
I was twice the age
of the dozen engineers in the room.

00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:26.371
I'd been brought in to the company

00:00:26.395 --> 00:00:28.674
because I was a seasoned
expert in my field,

00:00:28.698 --> 00:00:30.332
but in this particular room,

00:00:30.356 --> 00:00:33.063
I felt like a newbie amongst
the tech geniuses.

00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:37.465
I was listening to them talk

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.512
and thinking that the best thing
I could do was be invisible.

00:00:41.087 --> 00:00:45.546
And then suddenly, the 25-year-old
wizard leading the meeting stared at me

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.712
and asked, "If you shipped a feature
and no one used it,

00:00:49.736 --> 00:00:51.445
did it really ship?"

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:53.313
(Laughter)

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:55.891
"Ship a feature"?

00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:59.381
In that moment, Chip knew
he was in deep ship.

00:00:59.405 --> 00:01:00.412
(Laughter)

00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:03.269
I had no idea what he was talking about.

00:01:04.184 --> 00:01:07.610
I just sat there awkwardly,

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:09.981
and mercifully, he moved on
to someone else.

00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:12.003
I slid down in my chair,

00:01:12.027 --> 00:01:14.199
and I couldn't wait
for that meeting to end.

00:01:15.306 --> 00:01:17.845
That was my introduction to Airbnb.

00:01:18.907 --> 00:01:22.967
I was asked and invited
by the three millennial cofounders

00:01:22.991 --> 00:01:24.149
to join their company

00:01:24.173 --> 00:01:26.835
to help them take
their fast-growing tech start-up

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:29.529
and turn it into a global
hospitality brand,

00:01:29.553 --> 00:01:33.834
as well as to be the in-house
mentor for CEO Brian Chesky.

00:01:33.858 --> 00:01:38.754
Now, I'd spent from age 26 to 52
being a boutique hotel entrepreneur,

00:01:38.778 --> 00:01:41.307
and so I guess I'd learned
a few things along the way

00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:43.429
and accumulated
some hospitality knowledge.

00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:45.797
But after my first week,

00:01:45.821 --> 00:01:48.752
I realized that the brave new
home-sharing world

00:01:48.776 --> 00:01:53.304
didn't need much of my old-school
bricks-and-mortar hotel insights.

00:01:53.926 --> 00:01:56.033
A stark reality rocked me:

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.569
What do I have to offer?

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.410
I'd never been in a tech company before.

00:02:02.434 --> 00:02:07.244
Five and a half years ago, I had never
heard of the "sharing economy,"

00:02:07.268 --> 00:02:09.949
nor did I have an Uber
or Lyft app on my phone.

00:02:10.534 --> 00:02:13.116
This was not my natural habitat.

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:18.960
So, I decided at that moment
that I could either run for the hills,

00:02:18.984 --> 00:02:21.431
or cast judgment on these young geniuses,

00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:24.960
or instead, turn the judgment
into curiosity

00:02:24.984 --> 00:02:29.931
and actually see if I could match
my wise eyes with their fresh eyes.

00:02:29.955 --> 00:02:35.544
I fancied myself a modern Margaret Mead
amongst the millennials,

00:02:35.568 --> 00:02:39.423
and I quickly learned that I had
as much to offer them

00:02:39.447 --> 00:02:40.715
as they did to me.

00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:46.105
The more I've seen and learned
about our respective generations,

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.396
the more I realize that we often
don't trust each other enough

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.135
to actually share our respective wisdom.

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.410
We may share a border,

00:02:55.434 --> 00:02:58.078
but we don't necessarily trust
each other enough

00:02:58.102 --> 00:03:00.428
to share that respective wisdom.

00:03:01.654 --> 00:03:04.934
I believe, looking at
the modern workplace,

00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.703
that the trade agreement of our time

00:03:08.727 --> 00:03:14.098
is opening up these intergenerational
pipelines of wisdom

00:03:14.122 --> 00:03:16.617
so that we can all learn from each other.

00:03:17.336 --> 00:03:21.767
Almost 40 percent of us
in the United States

00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:24.052
have a boss that's younger than us,

00:03:24.076 --> 00:03:26.427
and that number is growing quickly.

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.339
Power is cascading to the young
like never before

00:03:30.363 --> 00:03:34.079
because of our increasing reliance on DQ:

00:03:34.103 --> 00:03:35.627
digital intelligence.

00:03:36.213 --> 00:03:40.024
We're seeing young founders
of companies in their early 20s

00:03:40.048 --> 00:03:44.975
scale them up to global giants
by the time they get to 30,

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:48.454
and yet, we expect
these young digital leaders

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:53.611
to somehow miraculously embody
the relationship wisdoms

00:03:53.635 --> 00:03:56.588
we older workers
have had decades to learn.

00:03:57.125 --> 00:04:00.800
It's hard to microwave
your emotional intelligence.

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:07.427
There's ample evidence that gender-
and ethnically diverse companies

00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:08.811
are more effective.

00:04:09.426 --> 00:04:10.682
But what about age?

00:04:11.265 --> 00:04:14.885
This is a very important question,
because for the first time ever,

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.735
we have five generations in the workplace
at the same time, unintentionally.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.205
Maybe it's time we got
a little more intentional

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.027
about how we work collectively.

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.732
There have been a number
of European studies

00:04:26.756 --> 00:04:31.416
that have shown that age-diverse teams
are more effective and successful.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.367
So why is that only eight percent
of the companies

00:04:36.391 --> 00:04:40.462
that have a diversity
and inclusion program

00:04:40.486 --> 00:04:42.648
have actually expanded that strategy

00:04:42.672 --> 00:04:47.901
to include age as just as important
of a demographic as gender or race?

00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:50.199
Maybe they didn't get the memo:

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:51.959
the world is getting older!

00:04:52.948 --> 00:04:54.935
One of the paradoxes of our time

00:04:54.959 --> 00:05:00.086
is that baby boomers are more vibrant
and healthy longer into life,

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.420
we're actually working later into life,

00:05:02.444 --> 00:05:05.210
and yet we're feeling
less and less relevant.

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.604
Some of us feel like a carton
of milk -- an old carton of milk --

00:05:09.628 --> 00:05:13.504
with an expiration date stamped
on our wrinkled foreheads.

00:05:14.092 --> 00:05:16.931
For many of us in midlife,
this isn't just a feeling,

00:05:16.955 --> 00:05:22.008
it is a harsh reality, when we suddenly
lose our job and the phone stops ringing.

00:05:22.844 --> 00:05:27.776
For many of us, justifiably, we worry
that people see our experience

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.372
as a liability, not an asset.

00:05:31.688 --> 00:05:35.619
You've heard of the old phrase --
or maybe the relatively new phrase --

00:05:35.643 --> 00:05:38.096
"Sixty is the new forty, physically."

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.287
Right?

00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:42.873
When it comes to power
in the workplace today,

00:05:42.897 --> 00:05:44.546
30 is the new 50.

00:05:45.797 --> 00:05:48.671
All right, well, this is all
pretty exciting, right?

00:05:48.695 --> 00:05:49.765
(Laughter)

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.743
Truthfully, power is moving
10 years younger.

00:05:53.048 --> 00:05:54.966
We're all going to live 10 years longer.

00:05:55.307 --> 00:05:56.457
Do the math.

00:05:56.834 --> 00:06:00.472
Society has created a new
20-year irrelevancy gap.

00:06:01.325 --> 00:06:03.539
Midlife used to be 45 to 65,

00:06:03.563 --> 00:06:08.260
but I would suggest it now stretches
into a midlife marathon 40 years long,

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:09.859
from 35 to 75.

00:06:10.607 --> 00:06:12.319
But wait -- there is a bright spot.

00:06:12.954 --> 00:06:18.867
Why is it that we actually get smarter
and wiser about our humanity as we age?

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.616
Our physical peak may be our 20s,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.514
our financial and salary peak
may be age 50,

00:06:27.538 --> 00:06:31.448
but our emotional peak
is in midlife and beyond,

00:06:31.472 --> 00:06:36.485
because we have developed pattern
recognition about ourselves and others.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.513
So how can we get companies
to tap into that wisdom

00:06:40.537 --> 00:06:42.857
of the midlife folks,

00:06:42.881 --> 00:06:46.881
just as they nurture their digital
young geniuses as well?

00:06:47.547 --> 00:06:51.081
The most successful companies
today and in the future

00:06:51.105 --> 00:06:54.224
will actually learn how to create
a powerful alchemy of the two.

00:06:54.794 --> 00:06:56.985
Here's how the alchemy
worked for me at Airbnb:

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:00.406
I was assigned a young, smart partner,

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.643
who helped me develop
a hospitality department.

00:07:03.667 --> 00:07:08.588
Early on, Laura Hughes could see
that I was a little lost in this habitat,

00:07:08.612 --> 00:07:11.202
so she often sat
right next to me in meetings

00:07:11.226 --> 00:07:13.204
so she could be my tech translator,

00:07:13.228 --> 00:07:16.866
and I could write her notes and she
could tell me, "That's what that means."

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.465
Laura was 27 years old,

00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:20.412
she'd worked for Google for four years

00:07:20.436 --> 00:07:23.919
and then for a year and a half
at Airbnb when I met her.

00:07:24.386 --> 00:07:27.050
Like many of her millennial cohorts,

00:07:27.074 --> 00:07:31.103
she had actually grown into
a managerial role

00:07:31.127 --> 00:07:34.097
before she'd gotten any formal
leadership training.

00:07:34.836 --> 00:07:37.259
I don't care if you're
in the B-to-B world,

00:07:37.283 --> 00:07:41.224
the B-to-C world, the C-to-C world
or the A-to-Z world,

00:07:41.248 --> 00:07:44.716
business is fundamentally H-to-H:

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.322
human to human.

00:07:46.709 --> 00:07:49.530
And yet, Laura's approach to leadership

00:07:49.554 --> 00:07:52.713
was really formed
in the technocratic world,

00:07:52.737 --> 00:07:54.712
and it was purely metric driven.

00:07:55.236 --> 00:07:58.174
One of the things she said to me
in the first few months was,

00:07:58.198 --> 00:08:00.524
"I love the fact that your
approach to leadership

00:08:00.548 --> 00:08:04.189
is to create a compelling vision
that becomes a North Star for us."

00:08:04.782 --> 00:08:06.507
Now, my fact knowledge,

00:08:06.531 --> 00:08:10.488
as in, how many rooms a maid cleans
in an eight-hour shift,

00:08:10.512 --> 00:08:13.390
might not be all that important
in a home-sharing world.

00:08:13.912 --> 00:08:18.211
My process knowledge
of "How do you get things done?"

00:08:18.235 --> 00:08:22.937
based upon understanding the underlying
motivations of everybody in the room,

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:24.715
was incredibly valuable,

00:08:24.739 --> 00:08:29.013
in a company where most people didn't have
a lot of organizational experience.

00:08:30.169 --> 00:08:32.333
As I spent more time at Airbnb,

00:08:32.357 --> 00:08:36.847
I realized it's possible
a new kind of elder was emerging

00:08:36.871 --> 00:08:38.333
in the workplace.

00:08:38.357 --> 00:08:43.176
Not the elder of the past, who actually
was regarded with reverence.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.666
No, what is striking about the modern
elder is their relevance,

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:53.245
their ability to use timeless wisdom
and apply it to modern-day problems.

00:08:54.788 --> 00:08:59.929
Maybe it's time we actually valued wisdom
as much as we do disruption.

00:09:00.615 --> 00:09:04.251
And maybe it's time --
not just maybe, it is time --

00:09:04.275 --> 00:09:07.643
for us to definitely reclaim
the word "elder"

00:09:07.667 --> 00:09:09.488
and give it a modern twist.

00:09:09.964 --> 00:09:13.970
The modern elder is as much an intern
as they are a mentor,

00:09:13.994 --> 00:09:17.846
because they realize, in a world
that is changing so quickly,

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:22.803
their beginners' mind and their catalytic
curiosity is a life-affirming elixir,

00:09:22.827 --> 00:09:25.406
not just for themselves
but for everyone around them.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:30.072
Intergenerational improv has been known
in music and the arts:

00:09:30.096 --> 00:09:33.686
think Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:37.070
or Wynton Marsalis
and the Young Stars of Jazz.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:45.044
This kind of riffing in the business world
is often called "mutual mentorship":

00:09:45.068 --> 00:09:50.272
millennial DQ for Gen X and boomer EQ.

00:09:51.562 --> 00:09:57.276
I got to experience that kind of
intergenerational reciprocity with Laura

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.166
and our stellar data science team

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.994
when we were actually
remaking and evolving

00:10:02.018 --> 00:10:04.659
the Airbnb peer-to-peer review system,

00:10:04.683 --> 00:10:09.479
using Laura's analytical mind
and my human-centered intuition.

00:10:09.975 --> 00:10:15.482
With that perfect alchemy
of algorithm and people wisdom,

00:10:15.506 --> 00:10:19.417
we were able to create
and instantaneous feedback loop

00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:24.067
that helped our hosts better understand
the needs of our guests.

00:10:24.758 --> 00:10:27.308
High tech meets high touch.

00:10:28.269 --> 00:10:31.686
At Airbnb, I also learned
as a modern elder

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:37.288
that my role was to intern publicly
and mentor privately.

00:10:37.312 --> 00:10:41.272
Search engines are brilliant
at giving you an answer,

00:10:41.296 --> 00:10:46.944
but a wise, sage guide can offer you
just the right question.

00:10:48.272 --> 00:10:50.950
Google does not understand,
at least not yet,

00:10:50.974 --> 00:10:55.295
nuance like a finely attuned
human heart and mind.

00:10:55.671 --> 00:10:56.921
Over time,

00:10:57.738 --> 00:10:59.255
to my surprise,

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:03.065
dozens and dozens of young employees
at Airbnb sought me out

00:11:03.089 --> 00:11:05.108
for private mentoring sessions.

00:11:05.132 --> 00:11:09.030
But in reality, we were often
just mentoring each other.

00:11:09.559 --> 00:11:15.875
In sum, CEO Brian Chesky brought me in
for my industry knowledge,

00:11:15.899 --> 00:11:19.460
but what I really offered
was my well-earned wisdom.

00:11:20.182 --> 00:11:25.158
Maybe it's time we retire the term
"knowledge worker"

00:11:25.182 --> 00:11:28.163
and replaced it with "wisdom worker."

00:11:28.775 --> 00:11:31.403
We have five generations
in the workplace today,

00:11:31.427 --> 00:11:34.819
and we can operate like
separate isolationist countries,

00:11:34.843 --> 00:11:41.734
or we can actually start to find a way
to bridge these generational borders.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:46.825
And it's time for us to actually look
at how to change up the physics of wisdom

00:11:46.849 --> 00:11:48.817
so it actually flows in both directions,

00:11:48.841 --> 00:11:51.935
from old to young and from young to old.

00:11:52.908 --> 00:11:55.034
How can you apply this in your own life?

00:11:55.837 --> 00:11:58.766
Personally, who can you reach out to

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.968
to create a mutual
mentorship relationship?

00:12:02.843 --> 00:12:07.492
And organizationally,
how can you create the conditions

00:12:07.516 --> 00:12:11.439
to foster an intergenerational
flow of wisdom?

00:12:12.016 --> 00:12:15.152
This is the new sharing economy.

00:12:15.792 --> 00:12:16.943
Thank you.

00:12:16.967 --> 00:12:19.626
