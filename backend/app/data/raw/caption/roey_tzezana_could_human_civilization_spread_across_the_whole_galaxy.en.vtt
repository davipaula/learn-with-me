00:00:06.659 --> 00:00:12.099
Could human civilization eventually spread
across the whole Milky Way galaxy?

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.249
Could we move beyond 
our small blue planet

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:19.699
to establish colonies in the multitude
of star systems out there?

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.957
This question's a pretty daunting one.

00:00:21.957 --> 00:00:25.939
There are around 300 billion stars
in the galaxy,

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.488
which is about 160,000 light-years across.

00:00:29.488 --> 00:00:34.016
So far we've sent a single spacecraft
outside our solar system,

00:00:34.016 --> 00:00:39.209
trudging along at 0.006% of 
the speed of light.

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:42.615
At that rate, it would take over 
2.5 billion years

00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:45.759
just to get from one end of the galaxy
to the other.

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:48.329
And then there's the question 
of human survival.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.460
The gulf between stars is simply enormous.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.169
We couldn't live sustainably 
on most planets,

00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:57.880
and we require a lot of resources
to stay alive.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.880
And yet, decades ago, scholars found
that it's theoretically possible

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.181
to not just spread human civilization
across the galaxy,

00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:07.610
but to do so quite quickly,

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.980
without breaking any known 
laws of physics.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.139
Their idea is based on the work
of a mathematician named John von Neumann,

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:18.890
who designed on paper machines 
that could self-replicate

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.679
and create new generations of themselves.

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.570
These would later come to be known
as von Neumann machines.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.532
In the context of space exploration,

00:01:27.532 --> 00:01:30.041
von Neumann machines could be
built on Earth

00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:32.182
and launched into space.

00:01:32.182 --> 00:01:36.242
There, the self-sufficient machines
would land on distant planets.

00:01:36.242 --> 00:01:40.442
They would then mine the available
resources and harvest energy,

00:01:40.442 --> 00:01:42.691
build replicas of themselves,

00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:44.632
launch those to the nearest planets,

00:01:44.632 --> 00:01:46.451
and continue the cycle.

00:01:46.451 --> 00:01:49.492
The result is the creation 
of millions of probes

00:01:49.492 --> 00:01:54.112
spreading outwards into the universe
like a drop of ink in a fishbowl.

00:01:54.112 --> 00:01:57.722
Scholars crunched the numbers and found
that a single von Neumann machine

00:01:57.722 --> 00:02:00.401
traveling at 5% of the speed of light

00:02:00.401 --> 00:02:06.123
should be able to replicate throughout
our galaxy in 4 million years or less.

00:02:06.123 --> 00:02:07.972
That may sound like a long time,

00:02:07.972 --> 00:02:11.554
but when you consider that our universe
is 14 billion years old,

00:02:11.554 --> 00:02:14.323
on a cosmic scale, it's incredibly fast -

00:02:14.323 --> 00:02:19.763
the equivalent of about 2.5 hours
in an entire year.

00:02:19.763 --> 00:02:23.253
Creating von Neumann machines
would require a few technologies

00:02:23.253 --> 00:02:24.893
we don't have yet,

00:02:24.893 --> 00:02:27.054
including advanced 
artificial intelligence,

00:02:27.054 --> 00:02:28.554
miniaturization,

00:02:28.554 --> 00:02:30.793
and better propulsion systems.

00:02:30.793 --> 00:02:34.253
If we wanted to use them to spread actual
humans throughout the galaxy,

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:37.013
we would need 
yet another technological leap -

00:02:37.013 --> 00:02:41.599
the ability to artificially 
grow biological organisms and bodies

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.933
using raw elements 
and genetic information.

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:47.432
Regardless, if in the last billion years

00:02:47.432 --> 00:02:50.221
an alien civilization 
created such a machine

00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:53.124
and set it multiplying its way toward us,

00:02:53.124 --> 00:02:56.373
our galaxy would be 
swarming with them by now.

00:02:56.373 --> 00:02:58.978
So then where are all these machines?

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:01.075
Some astronomers, like Carl Sagan,

00:03:01.075 --> 00:03:06.032
say that intelligent aliens wouldn't
build self-replicating machines at all.

00:03:06.032 --> 00:03:07.770
They might hurtle out of control,

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.521
scavenging planets to their cores
in order to keep replicating.

00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:13.730
Others take the machines absence as proof

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.115
that intelligent alien civilizations 
don't exist,

00:03:17.115 --> 00:03:21.684
or that they go extinct before they can
develop the necessary technologies.

00:03:21.684 --> 00:03:25.056
But all this hasn't stopped people from
imagining what it would be like

00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:27.097
if they were out there.

00:03:27.097 --> 00:03:28.865
Science fiction author David Brin

00:03:28.865 --> 00:03:33.006
writes about a universe in which
many different von Neumann machines exist

00:03:33.006 --> 00:03:35.193
and proliferate simultaneously.

00:03:35.193 --> 00:03:38.274
Some are designed 
to greet young civilizations,

00:03:38.274 --> 00:03:41.855
others to locate and destroy them
before they become a threat.

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:44.825
In fact, in Brin's story "Lungfish,"

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:50.375
some von Neumann machines are keeping
a close watch over the Earth right now,

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:53.198
waiting for us to reach a certain level
of sophistication

00:03:53.198 --> 00:03:55.739
before they make their move.

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.026
For now, all we have is curiosity 
and theory.

00:03:59.026 --> 00:04:01.140
But the next time 
you look at the night sky,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.085
consider that billions of
self-replicating machines

00:04:04.085 --> 00:04:09.515
could be advancing between stars
in our galaxy right now.

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:13.295
If they exist, one of them will eventually
land on Earth,

00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:17.115
or maybe, just maybe,
they're already here.
