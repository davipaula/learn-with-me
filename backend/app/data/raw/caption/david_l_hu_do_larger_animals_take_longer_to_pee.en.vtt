00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:11.861
A cat’s bladder can only store 
a golf ball’s worth of urine.

00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:16.786
For humans, it’s a coffee mug 
and for elephants, a kitchen trash can.

00:00:16.786 --> 00:00:20.959
An elephant’s bladder is 400 times 
the size of a cat’s,

00:00:20.959 --> 00:00:24.789
but it doesn’t take an elephant 400 times
longer to pee.

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:27.109
So, how does this work?

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.516
The answer lies in what scientists call
the “Other Golden Rule.”

00:00:32.516 --> 00:00:37.511
It applies to mammals, which pee out
some of their wastes in a yellowy liquid.

00:00:37.511 --> 00:00:41.962
Other classes of animals use different
systems and methods to excrete waste.

00:00:41.962 --> 00:00:47.840
The Rule describes how urinary organs
and forces change with body size,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.319
enabling a range of mammals
to achieve similarly rapid relief.

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:57.289
There are two main factors 
contributing to urination speed:

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.119
bladder pressure and gravity.

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:03.699
Bladder pressure is created 
when mammals contract their muscles

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.529
to squeeze urine out.

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:10.415
This pressure is equal to the applied 
muscular force per unit area but,

00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:13.055
since these factors scale proportionally,

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:18.053
bladder pressure doesn’t actually 
change much depending on body size.

00:01:18.053 --> 00:01:23.736
Meanwhile, the effects of gravity
do vary across species.

00:01:23.736 --> 00:01:27.526
Mammals have a pipe-like organ 
called the urethra

00:01:27.526 --> 00:01:31.356
that transports urine 
from a higher elevation to a lower one—

00:01:31.356 --> 00:01:35.924
specifically, from the bladder 
down to where urine exits the body.

00:01:35.924 --> 00:01:41.161
In doing so, the urethra harnesses 
the power of Torricelli’s Law,

00:01:41.161 --> 00:01:45.397
which states that flow rate 
increases with container height.

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:49.157
Take these two containers holding 
the same volume of liquid.

00:01:49.157 --> 00:01:51.607
When identically punctured at the bottom,

00:01:51.607 --> 00:01:55.277
the vertical container drains 
nearly twice as fast.

00:01:55.277 --> 00:01:59.695
This is because the water’s falling
from a greater elevation difference.

00:01:59.695 --> 00:02:05.651
By transporting urine from high to low, 
the urethra has a similar effect.

00:02:05.651 --> 00:02:08.721
The urethra is probably not perfectly
vertical,

00:02:08.721 --> 00:02:12.962
so its length doesn’t tell us exactly 
how far the urine falls.

00:02:12.962 --> 00:02:16.382
However, it’s a good approximation.

00:02:16.382 --> 00:02:20.052
The urethra’s diameter 
also affects flow rate.

00:02:20.052 --> 00:02:24.052
When that vertical container’s exit hole 
has a larger diameter,

00:02:24.052 --> 00:02:27.802
the water drains out even faster.

00:02:27.802 --> 00:02:31.502
The length and diameter 
of an animal’s urethra varies

00:02:31.502 --> 00:02:35.667
depending on its species 
and whether it has a penis or vagina.

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:40.030
For example, a female elephant 
has a meter-long urethra

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.050
with a thirty-five millimeter diameter.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.128
A person with a vagina has a urethra
that is more than 20 times shorter

00:02:48.128 --> 00:02:50.638
and 5 times thinner.

00:02:50.638 --> 00:02:55.046
The elephant’s longer, wider urethra 
is what allows it to urinate

00:02:55.046 --> 00:02:58.536
for a comparable amount
of time as a human.

00:02:58.536 --> 00:03:01.976
Indeed, if an elephant had the urethra
of a housecat,

00:03:01.976 --> 00:03:06.256
it might take it about 2 hours
to drain its bladder.

00:03:06.256 --> 00:03:08.936
It’s hypothesized 
that the Other Golden Rule

00:03:08.936 --> 00:03:13.842
is conserved because quicker pees 
may both reduce vulnerability to predators

00:03:13.842 --> 00:03:17.012
and flush out disease-causing pathogens.

00:03:17.012 --> 00:03:19.502
But the Rule has limitations.

00:03:19.502 --> 00:03:23.232
It’s only been shown to apply 
to non-aquatic mammals.

00:03:23.232 --> 00:03:27.232
And the Rule doesn’t apply to mammals
under three kilograms.

00:03:27.232 --> 00:03:31.062
They actually pee in droplets,
not continuous streams,

00:03:31.062 --> 00:03:35.552
because surface tension 
breaks up their tiny jets of urine.

00:03:35.552 --> 00:03:39.022
Even within non-aquatic mammals 
above three kilograms,

00:03:39.022 --> 00:03:42.872
different behaviors disrupt 
the Other Golden Rule.

00:03:42.872 --> 00:03:46.042
Male dogs don’t always fully empty 
their bladders

00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:50.670
and will instead tinkle in short spurts 
to mark their territory.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.550
Male pandas sometimes pee in handstands,
marking bark higher up on trees

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.571
in order to broadcast their scent
to potential mates.

00:04:00.571 --> 00:04:06.108
Handstand pees take longer 
because urine must work against gravity.

00:04:06.108 --> 00:04:08.701
Underwater pees are also lengthier

00:04:08.701 --> 00:04:13.349
because the external water pressure
counteracts the internal forces

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.679
resulting from elevation difference.

00:04:16.679 --> 00:04:20.679
Whether it’s with the intensity 
of a fire hydrant or a squirt gun,

00:04:20.679 --> 00:04:24.739
this system swiftly delivers our urine
to the outside world.
