00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.780
Consider the spot where you’re sitting.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.640
Travel backwards in time

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.500
and it might’ve been submerged at 
the bottom of a shallow sea,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.290
buried under miles of rock,

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.720
or floating through a molten, 
infernal landscape.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.568
But go back far enough—

00:00:23.568 --> 00:00:26.498
about 4.6 billion years,

00:00:26.498 --> 00:00:30.908
and you’d be in the middle of an enormous 
cloud of dust and gas

00:00:30.908 --> 00:00:34.434
orbiting a newborn star.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:39.844
This is the setting for some of the 
biggest, smallest mysteries of physics:

00:00:39.844 --> 00:00:43.410
the mysteries of cosmic dust bunnies.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.220
Seemingly empty regions 
of space between stars

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.350
actually contain clouds of gas and dust,

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.695
usually blown there by supernovas.

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:59.345
When a dense cloud reaches a certain 
threshold called the Jeans mass,

00:00:59.345 --> 00:01:02.215
it collapses in on itself.

00:01:02.215 --> 00:01:06.765
The shrinking cloud rotates faster 
and faster, and heats up,

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:11.539
eventually becoming hot enough to burn 
hydrogen in its core.

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.129
At this point a star is born.

00:01:14.129 --> 00:01:16.689
As fusion begins in the new star,

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.979
it sends out jets of gas that blow 
off the top and bottom of the cloud,

00:01:21.986 --> 00:01:28.906
leaving behind an orbiting ring of gas 
and dust called a protoplanetary disk.

00:01:28.906 --> 00:01:31.964
This is a surprisingly windy place;

00:01:31.964 --> 00:01:36.944
eddies of gas carry particles apart, 
and send them smashing into each other.

00:01:36.944 --> 00:01:43.567
The dust consists of tiny metal fragments,
bits of rock, and, further out, ices.

00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:46.691
We’ve observed thousands of these disks 
in the sky,

00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:48.951
at various stages of development

00:01:48.951 --> 00:01:53.761
as dust clumps together
into larger and larger masses.

00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:59.401
Dust grains 100 times smaller than the 
width of a human hair stick to each other

00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:02.321
through what’s called 
the van der Waals force.

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:06.711
That’s where a cloud of electrons 
shifts to one side of a molecule,

00:02:06.716 --> 00:02:11.546
creating a negative charge on one end, 
and a positive charge on the other.

00:02:11.546 --> 00:02:16.846
Opposites attract, but van der Waals can 
only hold tiny things together.

00:02:16.846 --> 00:02:21.156
And there’s a problem: once dust 
clusters grow to a certain size,

00:02:21.156 --> 00:02:25.062
the windy atmosphere of a disk should 
constantly break them up

00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:26.982
as they crash into each other.

00:02:26.982 --> 00:02:33.192
The question of how they continue to grow
is the first mystery of dust bunnies.

00:02:33.192 --> 00:02:37.417
One theory looks to electrostatic charge 
to answer this.

00:02:37.417 --> 00:02:41.536
Energetic gamma rays, x-rays, 
and UV photons

00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:45.290
knock electrons off of gas 
atoms within the disk,

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.105
creating positive ions 
and negative electrons.

00:02:49.105 --> 00:02:52.125
Electrons run into and stick to dust,

00:02:52.125 --> 00:02:54.435
making it negatively charged.

00:02:54.435 --> 00:02:57.455
Now, when the wind pushes 
clusters together,

00:02:57.455 --> 00:03:02.295
like repels like 
and slows them down as they collide.

00:03:02.295 --> 00:03:04.915
With gentle collisions 
they won’t fragment,

00:03:04.915 --> 00:03:08.685
but if the repulsion is too strong, 
they’ll never grow.

00:03:08.685 --> 00:03:12.015
One theory suggests that high energy 
particles

00:03:12.015 --> 00:03:15.535
can knock more electrons off of some 
dust clumps,

00:03:15.535 --> 00:03:17.815
leaving them positively charged.

00:03:17.815 --> 00:03:22.695
Opposites again attract, 
and clusters grow rapidly.

00:03:22.695 --> 00:03:26.325
But before long we reach 
another set of mysteries.

00:03:26.325 --> 00:03:28.975
We know from evidence found in meteorites

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:33.345
that these fluffy dust bunnies 
eventually get heated, melted

00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:38.612
and then cooled into solid 
pellets called chondrules.

00:03:38.612 --> 00:03:42.590
And we have no idea how 
or why that happens.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.470
Furthermore, once those pellets do form,
how do they stick together?

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.980
The electrostatic forces from before 
are too weak,

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.300
and small rocks can’t be held together 
by gravity either.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.250
Gravity increases proportionally to the 
mass of the objects involved.

00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:05.191
That’s why you could effortlessly escape 
an asteroid the size of a small mountain

00:04:05.191 --> 00:04:08.581
using just the force generated 
by your legs.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:11.551
So if not gravity, then what?

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:13.731
Perhaps it’s dust.

00:04:13.731 --> 00:04:17.921
A fluffy dust rim collected around the 
outside of the pellets

00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:19.746
could act like Velcro.

00:04:19.746 --> 00:04:22.366
There’s evidence for this in meteors,

00:04:22.366 --> 00:04:28.116
where we find many chondrules surrounded
by a thin rim of very fine material–

00:04:28.116 --> 00:04:31.469
possibly condensed dust.

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:36.779
Eventually the chondrule pellets get 
cemented together inside larger rocks,

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:39.259
which at about 1 kilometer across

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:43.889
are finally large enough to hold 
themselves together through gravity.

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.489
They continue to collide and grow 
into larger and larger bodies,

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:51.207
including the planets we know today.

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:54.357
Ultimately, the seeds of 
everything familiar–

00:04:54.357 --> 00:04:57.447
the size of our planet, its position 
within the solar system,

00:04:57.447 --> 00:04:59.937
and its elemental composition–

00:04:59.937 --> 00:05:05.793
were determined by an uncountably large 
series of random collisions.

00:05:05.793 --> 00:05:08.180
Change the dust cloud just a bit,

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.810
and perhaps the conditions wouldn’t 
have been right

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.600
for the formation of life on our planet.
