00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:14.512
I think that at the time,

00:00:14.554 --> 00:00:17.863
Catwoman had a really
cool pair of glasses

00:00:17.887 --> 00:00:20.905
in the Batman series
that was on television.

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:22.988
And I wanted to be cool like her.

00:00:23.012 --> 00:00:24.280
It didn't occur to me

00:00:24.304 --> 00:00:26.821
that glasses were really a medical device.

00:00:26.845 --> 00:00:28.505
(Small Thing.)

00:00:28.525 --> 00:00:30.025
(Big Idea.)

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:34.696
When light rays reflect off an object

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.530
and enter the eye through the cornea,

00:00:36.554 --> 00:00:40.155
your retina converts this
light into electrical impulses

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:41.821
that are sent to the brain,

00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:43.613
which interprets the impulses

00:00:43.637 --> 00:00:46.738
and allows you to understand
what you're seeing.

00:00:46.762 --> 00:00:48.905
Eyeglasses help you see.

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.863
The earliest forms of eye gear

00:00:50.887 --> 00:00:53.738
can be traced back 4,000 years.

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:57.571
Cultures that needed to adapt
to climates that were snowy

00:00:57.595 --> 00:00:58.988
created eye shields,

00:00:59.012 --> 00:01:02.405
and they were made of
bone and animal hides.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.446
They had small slits
for people to see through,

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.071
but no lenses.

00:01:07.095 --> 00:01:09.696
The first vision aid
was called a reading stone

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.655
and was invented over 1,000 years ago.

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:17.363
It's not exactly clear
who invented the first eyeglasses,

00:01:17.387 --> 00:01:19.863
but many people
attribute it to the Italians.

00:01:19.887 --> 00:01:23.780
Early versions of eyeglasses
were called rivet spectacles.

00:01:23.804 --> 00:01:27.446
They were two magnifying glasses
that were hinged together

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.780
at the bridge of the nose.

00:01:28.804 --> 00:01:32.488
It took some time for eyeglasses to land

00:01:32.512 --> 00:01:34.071
on the perfect design.

00:01:34.095 --> 00:01:36.238
They didn't really have sides,

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:39.446
which are also called temples, or arms,

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.613
until about the 17th century.

00:01:41.637 --> 00:01:44.946
Modern-day eyeglasses
feature a pair of rims

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.905
that hold corrective lenses,

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.363
a bridge that connects the rims,

00:01:49.387 --> 00:01:51.988
sides that slide behind the ears,

00:01:52.012 --> 00:01:54.988
hinges that connect
the sides to the frames,

00:01:55.012 --> 00:01:58.238
and on some glasses, a pair of temple tips

00:01:58.262 --> 00:02:00.196
for behind the ear comfort.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.530
In American culture,

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:04.863
20th century cinema
helped popularize eyeglasses.

00:02:04.887 --> 00:02:08.613
Audiences would see
glamorous actresses and actors

00:02:08.637 --> 00:02:11.613
donning glasses
to take on a different persona.

00:02:11.637 --> 00:02:14.113
Sometimes a pair of glasses
became popularized

00:02:14.137 --> 00:02:17.321
by the actual person
that was wearing them,

00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:19.155
and then that personality trait

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:22.238
was projected into the actual device.

00:02:22.262 --> 00:02:23.863
You had the aviator glasses,

00:02:23.887 --> 00:02:25.905
which showed a forward-thinking,

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:27.946
adventurous type of person.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.280
Glasses with heavy frames
signified intelligence

00:02:32.304 --> 00:02:33.863
or nerdiness.

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:37.071
Wayfarers signified
this kind of nerdy punk,

00:02:37.095 --> 00:02:38.571
the outlaw, the misfit.

00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:42.655
Glasses have become
so popular as a fashion device

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:45.530
that some people actually don glasses

00:02:45.554 --> 00:02:47.780
without a prescription lens at all,

00:02:47.804 --> 00:02:51.905
because they want to portray
a certain attribute about themselves.

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:54.113
Glasses are a lifeline to people.

00:02:54.137 --> 00:02:57.113
People that can't see
well enough to drive,

00:02:57.137 --> 00:02:59.863
well enough to cook, well enough to read

00:02:59.887 --> 00:03:04.030
rely on glasses
for maintaining their lives.

00:03:04.054 --> 00:03:06.446
And there's lots of other
objects in our society

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.738
that have been created

00:03:07.762 --> 00:03:11.196
to help overcome various
physical obstacles.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.363
And it's only the eyeglasses

00:03:13.387 --> 00:03:17.155
that have catapulted
to that fashion statement.

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:20.613
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if anything that we use,

00:03:20.637 --> 00:03:24.613
any device that we've invented
to help our humanity

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:26.988
could also be elevated in the same way?

00:03:27.012 --> 00:03:29.637
