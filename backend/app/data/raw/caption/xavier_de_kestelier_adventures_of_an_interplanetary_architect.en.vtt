00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.096
I must have been about 12 years old

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.176
when my dad took me
to an exhibition on space,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.680
not far from here, in Brussels.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.656
And the year was about --
I think it was 1988,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.520
so it was the end of the Cold War.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.016
There was a bit of an upmanship going on
between the Americans and the Russians

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.280
bringing bits to that exhibition.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.520
NASA brought a big blow-up space shuttle,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.736
but the Russians,
they brought a Mir space station.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.816
It was actually the training module,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.336
and you could go inside
and check it all out.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.936
It was the real thing --

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.096
where the buttons were,
where the wires were,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.216
where the astronauts were eating,
where they were working.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.136
And when I came home,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.440
the first thing I did,
I started drawing spaceships.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.376
Now, these weren't
science fiction spaceships, no.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.296
They were actually technical drawings.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.976
They were cutaway sections

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.936
of what kind of structure
would be made out of,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.520
where the wires were,
where the screws were.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.696
So fortunately, I didn't
become a space engineer,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.360
but I did become an architect.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.696
These are some of the projects
that I've been involved with

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.976
over the last decade and a half.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.456
All these projects are quite different,
quite different shapes,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.336
and it is because they are built
for different environments.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.920
They have different constraints.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.456
And I think design
becomes really interesting

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.440
when you get really harsh constraints.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.520
Now, these projects
have been all over the world.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.616
A few years ago,
this map wasn't good enough.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.056
It was too small.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.000
We had to add this one,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.136
because we were going to do
a project on the Moon

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.896
for the European Space Agency;

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.416
they asked us to design a Moon habitat --

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.576
and one on Mars with NASA,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.920
a competition to look
at a habitation on Mars.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.936
Whenever you go to another place,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.416
as an architect

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.040
and try to design something,

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.816
you look at the local architecture,
the precedents that are there.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.296
Now, on the Moon,
it's kind of difficult, of course,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.576
because there's only this.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.480
There's only the Apollo missions.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.536
So last that we went there,
I wasn't even born yet,

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.800
and we only spent about three days there.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.936
So for me, that's kind of
a long camping trip, isn't it,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.400
but a rather expensive one.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.776
Now, the tricky thing,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.736
when you're going to build
on another planet or a moon,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.296
is how to get it there,
how to get it there.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.336
So first of all,

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.576
to get a kilogram, for example,
to the Moon's surface,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.200
it will cost about 200,000 dollars,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.216
very expensive.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.480
So you want to keep it very light.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.416
Second, space. Space is limited. Right?

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.456
This is the Ariane 5 rocket.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.736
The space you have there

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.320
is about four and a half meters
by seven meters, not that much.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.136
So it needs to be an architectural system

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.416
that is both compact,
or compactable, and light,

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.080
and I think I've got one right here.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.456
It's very compact,

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.056
and it's very light.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.736
And actually,

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.200
this is one I made earlier.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.936
Now, there's one problem with it,

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.440
that inflatables

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.920
are quite fragile.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.640
They need to be protected,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.200
specifically, when you go
to a very harsh environment like the Moon.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.800
Look at it like this.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.336
The temperature difference on a Moon base

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.416
could be anything up to 200 degrees.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.336
On one side of the base,
it could be 100 degrees Celsius

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.840
and on the other side,
it could be minus 100 degrees.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.280
We need to protect ourselves from that.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.960
The Moon also does not have
any magnetic fields,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.096
which means that any radiation --
solar radiation, cosmic radiation --

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.440
will hit the surface.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.536
We need to protect ourselves
from that as well,

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.160
protect the astronauts from that.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.616
And then third,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.416
but definitely not last,

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.080
the Moon does not have any atmosphere,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.896
which means any meteorites coming into it
will not get burned up,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.296
and they'll hit the surface.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.600
That's why the Moon is full of craters.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.960
Again, we need to protect
the astronauts from that.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.976
So what kind of structure do we need?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.816
Well, the best thing is really a cave,

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.256
because a cave has a lot of mass,
and we need mass.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.256
We need mass to protect
ourselves from the temperatures,

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.896
from the radiation

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.640
and from the meteorites.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.440
So this is how we solved it.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.016
We have indeed the blue part,
as you can see.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.776
That's an inflatable for our Moon base.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.280
It gives a lot of living space
and a lot of lab space,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.776
and attached to it you have a cylinder,

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.856
and that has all
the support structures in,

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.120
all the life support and also the airlock.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.376
And on top of that, we have a structure,
that domed structure,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.776
that protects ourselves,

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.160
has a lot of mass in it.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.576
Where are we going
to get this material from?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.696
Are we going to bring concrete and cement
from Earth to the Moon?

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.256
Well, of course not,
because it's way too heavy.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.536
It's too expensive.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.416
So we're going to go
and use local materials.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.536
Now, local materials are something
we deal with on Earth as well.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.936
Wherever we build
or whatever country we build in,

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.456
we always look at,
what are the local materials here?

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.336
The problem with the Moon is,
what are the local materials?

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.576
Well, there's not that many.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.176
Actually, we have one.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.400
It's moondust,

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.480
or, fancier scientific name,
regolith, Moon regolith.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.376
Great thing is, it's everywhere, right?

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.416
The surface is covered with it.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.960
It's about 20 centimeters
up to a few meters everywhere.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.040
But how are we going to build with it?

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.120
Well, we're going to use a 3D printer.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.776
Whenever I ask any of you
what a 3D printer is,

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.136
you're probably all thinking, well,
probably something about this size

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.776
and it would print things
that are about this size.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.016
So of course I'm not going to bring
a massive 3D printer to the Moon

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.296
to print my Moon base.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.320
I'm going to use a much smaller device,
something like this one here.

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.856
So this is a small device,
a small robot rover,

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.200
that has a little scoop,

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.816
and it brings the regolith to the dome

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.976
and then it lays down
a thin layer of regolith,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.416
and then you would have
the robot that will solidify it,

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.456
layer by layer,

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.416
until it creates, after a few months,

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.640
the full base.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.176
You might have noticed

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.416
that it's quite a particular
structure that we're printing,

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.200
and I've got a little example here.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.616
What we call this
is a closed-cell foam structure.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.816
Looks quite natural.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.496
The reason why we're using this

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.576
as part of that shell structure

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.360
is that we only need
to solidify certain parts,

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.376
which means we have to bring
less binder from Earth,

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.000
and it becomes much lighter.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.040
Now --

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.536
that approach of designing something

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.496
and then covering it
with a protective dome

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.680
we also did for our Mars project.

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.776
You can see it here, three domes.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.440
And you see the printers
printing these dome structures.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.616
There's a big difference
between Mars and the Moon,

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.016
and let me explain it.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.536
This diagram shows you to scale

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.256
the size of Earth and the Moon
and the real distance,

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.200
about 400,000 kilometers.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.400
If we then go to Mars,

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.376
the distance from Mars to Earth --

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.616
and this picture here

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.656
is taken by the rover on Mars,
Curiosity, looking back at Earth.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.159
You kind of see the little speckle there,
that's Earth, 400 million kilometers away.

00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:46.496
The problem with that distance

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.535
is that it's a thousand times the distance
of the Earth to the Moon, pretty far away,

00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:57.056
but there's no direct radio contact
with, for example, the Curiosity rover.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.936
So I cannot teleoperate it from Earth.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.176
I can't say, "Oh, Mars rover, go left,"

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.320
because that signal
would take 20 minutes to get to Mars.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.976
Then the rover might go left,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.976
and then it will take another 20 minutes
before it can tell me,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.200
"Oh yeah, I went left."

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.736
So the distance,

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.976
so rovers and robots

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and going to have to work autonomously.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.016
The only issue with it

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.456
is that missions to Mars are highly risky.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.936
We've only seen it a few weeks ago.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.416
So what if half the mission
doesn't arrive at Mars.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.696
What do we do?

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.816
Well, instead of building
just one or two rovers

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.216
like we did on the Moon,

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.856
we're going to build hundreds of them.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.416
And it's a bit like
a termite's mound, you know?

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.976
Termites, I would take half
of the colony of the termites away,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.496
they would still be able
to build the mound.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.536
It might take a little bit longer.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.776
Same here.

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.816
If half of our rovers
or robots don't arrive,

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.136
well, it will take a bit longer,
but you will still be able to do it.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.216
So here we even have
three different rovers.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.040
In the back, you see the digger.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.280
It's really good at digging regolith.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.496
Then we have the transporter,

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.336
great at taking regolith
and bringing it to the structure.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.976
And the last ones,
the little ones with the little legs,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.456
they don't need to move a lot.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.416
What they do is they go
and sit on a layer of regolith

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.376
and then microwave it together,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.120
and layer by layer
create that dome structure.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.360
Now --

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.856
we also want to try that out,

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:43.216
so we went out on a road trip,

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.960
and we created our own swarm of robots.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.896
There you go.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.456
So we built 10 of those.
It's a small swarm.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.496
And we took six tons of sand,

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.896
and we tried out how these little robots

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.256
would actually be able
to move sand around,

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.376
Earth sand in this case.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.656
And they were not teleoperated. Right?

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.056
Nobody was telling them go left, go right,
or giving them a predescribed path.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.296
No. They were given a task:

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.640
move sand from this area to that area.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:21.096
And if they came across
an obstacle, like a rock,

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.496
they had to sort it out themselves.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.176
Or they came across another robot,

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.056
they had to be able to make decisions.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.176
Or even if half of them fell out,
their batteries died,

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.360
they still had to be able
to finish that task.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.160
Now, I've talked about redundancy.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.816
But that was not only with the robots.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.296
It was also with the habitats.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.120
On the Mars project,
we decided to do three domes,

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.136
because if one didn't arrive,

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.176
the other two could still form a base,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.336
and that was mainly because
each of the domes

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.296
actually have a life support system
built in the floor,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.520
so they can work independently.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.600
So in a way, you might think,
well, this is pretty crazy.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:14.216
Why would you, as an architect,
get involved in space?

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.720
Because it's such a technical field.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.456
Well, I'm actually really convinced

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:26.096
that from a creative view
or a design view,

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:32.176
you are able to solve really hard
and really constrained problems.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:36.016
And I really feel that there is
a place for design and architecture

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.760
in projects like
interplanetary habitation.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.536
Thank you.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.800
(Applause)
