00:00:12.687 --> 00:00:13.842
Visible from space,

00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.493
the Okavango Delta

00:00:15.517 --> 00:00:20.231
is Africa's largest remaining
intact wetland wilderness.

00:00:20.255 --> 00:00:26.096
This shining delta in landlocked Botswana
is the jewel of the Kalahari,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.549
more valuable than diamonds
to the world's largest diamond producer

00:00:30.573 --> 00:00:32.962
and celebrated in 2014

00:00:32.986 --> 00:00:36.471
as our planet's 1000th
UNESCO World Heritage Site.

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:39.400
Now, what you see here
are the two major tributaries,

00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:41.441
the Cuito and the Cubango,

00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:45.591
disappearing up north
into the little-known Angolan highlands.

00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:49.914
This is the largest undeveloped
river basin on the planet,

00:00:49.938 --> 00:00:52.061
spanning an area larger than California.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.170
These vast, undeveloped Angolan
watersheds were frozen in time

00:00:57.194 --> 00:00:59.552
by 27 years of civil war.

00:00:59.576 --> 00:01:03.577
In fact, Africa's largest tank battle
since World War II

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:07.033
was fought over a bridge
crossing the Okavango's Cuito River.

00:01:07.057 --> 00:01:08.448
There on the right,

00:01:08.472 --> 00:01:10.226
disappearing off into the unknown,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.599
into the "Terra do fim do mundo" --

00:01:12.623 --> 00:01:14.551
the land at the end of the earth,

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:17.464
as it was known by the first
Portuguese explorers.

00:01:18.275 --> 00:01:21.648
In 2001, at the age of 22,

00:01:21.672 --> 00:01:25.564
I took a job as head of housekeeping
at Vundumtiki Camp

00:01:25.588 --> 00:01:27.688
in the Okavango Delta ...

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:32.316
a patchwork mosaic of channels,
floodplains, lagoons

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.608
and thousands upon thousands
of islands to explore.

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.949
Home to the largest remaining
population of elephants on the planet.

00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:45.229
Rhinos are airlifted in C130s
to find sanctuary in this wilderness.

00:01:46.065 --> 00:01:47.215
Lion,

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:48.481
leopard,

00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:49.733
hyena,

00:01:49.757 --> 00:01:50.928
wild dog,

00:01:50.952 --> 00:01:52.225
cheetah,

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:56.024
ancient baobab trees
that stand like cathedrals

00:01:56.048 --> 00:01:57.535
under the Milky Way.

00:01:57.559 --> 00:02:01.126
Here, I discovered something obvious:

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.248
wilderness is our natural habitat, too.

00:02:04.272 --> 00:02:08.152
We need these last wild places
to reconnect with who we really are.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.280
We --

00:02:11.304 --> 00:02:12.602
all seven billion of us --

00:02:12.626 --> 00:02:16.057
must never forget
we are a biological species

00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:19.130
forever bound to this
particular biological world.

00:02:19.154 --> 00:02:21.421
Like the waves connected to the ocean,

00:02:21.445 --> 00:02:23.002
we cannot exist apart from it --

00:02:23.026 --> 00:02:27.814
a constant flow of atoms and energy
between individuals and species

00:02:27.838 --> 00:02:29.485
around the world in a day

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:31.601
and out into the cosmos.

00:02:33.022 --> 00:02:36.634
Our fates are forever connected
to the millions of species

00:02:36.658 --> 00:02:40.769
we rely on directly
and indirectly every day.

00:02:42.237 --> 00:02:43.507
Four years ago,

00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:47.870
it was declared that 50 percent
of all wildlife around the world

00:02:47.894 --> 00:02:50.235
had disappeared in just 40 years.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.536
This is a mass drowning
of 15,000 wildebeests

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.922
that I witnessed
in the Maasai Mara two years ago.

00:02:57.946 --> 00:03:00.279
This is definitely our fault.

00:03:01.376 --> 00:03:05.583
By 2020, global wildlife populations
are projected to have fallen

00:03:05.607 --> 00:03:07.797
by a staggering two-thirds.

00:03:07.821 --> 00:03:10.012
We are the sixth extinction

00:03:10.036 --> 00:03:13.151
because we left no safe space
for millions of species

00:03:13.175 --> 00:03:15.258
to sustainably coexist.

00:03:16.174 --> 00:03:21.977
Now, since 2010, I have poled myself
eight times across the Okavango Delta

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.740
to conduct detailed scientific surveys

00:03:24.764 --> 00:03:28.134
along a 200-mile,
18-day research transect.

00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:29.363
Now, why am I doing this?

00:03:29.387 --> 00:03:31.054
Why am I risking my life each year?

00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:33.299
I'm doing this because
we need this information

00:03:33.323 --> 00:03:35.323
to benchmark this near-pristine wilderness

00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:37.309
before upstream development happens.

00:03:37.852 --> 00:03:42.884
These are the Wayeyi river bushmen,
the people of the Okavango Delta.

00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:46.143
They have taught me all I know
about the Mother Okavango --

00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:47.833
about presence in the wild.

00:03:47.857 --> 00:03:51.869
Our shared pilgrimage across
the Okavango Delta each year

00:03:51.893 --> 00:03:53.870
in our mokoros or dugout canoes --

00:03:53.894 --> 00:03:56.769
remembers millenia living in the wild.

00:03:57.805 --> 00:03:59.572
Ten thousand years ago,

00:03:59.596 --> 00:04:02.392
our entire world was wilderness.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.870
Today, wilderness is all that remains
of that world, now gone.

00:04:09.675 --> 00:04:13.191
Ten thousand years ago,
we were as we are today:

00:04:13.215 --> 00:04:17.030
a modern, dreaming intelligence
unlike anything seen before.

00:04:17.054 --> 00:04:19.503
Living in the wilderness
is what taught us to speak,

00:04:19.527 --> 00:04:23.109
to seek technologies
like fire and stone, bow and arrow,

00:04:23.133 --> 00:04:24.965
medicine and poison,

00:04:24.989 --> 00:04:27.158
to domesticate plants and animals

00:04:27.182 --> 00:04:30.437
and rely on each other
and all living things around us.

00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:32.836
We are these last wildernesses --

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.188
every one of us.

00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:36.868
Over 80 percent
of our planet's land surface

00:04:36.892 --> 00:04:40.041
is now experiencing
measurable human impact:

00:04:40.065 --> 00:04:41.414
habitat destruction

00:04:41.438 --> 00:04:45.282
and illegal wildlife trade are decimating
global wildlife populations.

00:04:45.306 --> 00:04:49.242
We urgently need to create
safe space for these wild animals.

00:04:49.766 --> 00:04:51.511
So in late 2014,

00:04:51.535 --> 00:04:54.116
we launched an ambitious
project to do just that:

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.877
explore and protect.

00:04:56.472 --> 00:04:58.397
By mid-May 2015,

00:04:58.421 --> 00:05:00.750
we had pioneered access
through active minefields

00:05:00.774 --> 00:05:03.417
to the undocumented source lake
of the Cuito River --

00:05:03.441 --> 00:05:05.541
this otherworldly place;

00:05:05.565 --> 00:05:07.525
an ancient, untouched wilderness.

00:05:08.385 --> 00:05:09.680
By the 21st of May,

00:05:09.704 --> 00:05:13.013
we had launched
the Okavango megatransect ...

00:05:13.037 --> 00:05:14.698
in seven dugout canoes;

00:05:14.722 --> 00:05:18.799
1,500 miles, 121 days later,

00:05:18.823 --> 00:05:21.333
all of the poling, paddling
and intensive research

00:05:21.357 --> 00:05:25.119
got us across the entire river basin
to Lake Xau in the Kalahari Desert,

00:05:25.143 --> 00:05:28.447
480 kilometers past the Okavango Delta.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.644
My entire world became the water:

00:05:31.668 --> 00:05:35.429
every ripple, eddy,
lily pad and current ...

00:05:36.397 --> 00:05:38.146
any sign of danger,

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.044
every sign of life.

00:05:40.952 --> 00:05:43.904
Now imagine millions of sweat bees
choking the air around you,

00:05:43.928 --> 00:05:45.165
flesh-eating bacteria,

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:48.579
the constant threat
of a landmine going off

00:05:48.603 --> 00:05:50.935
or an unseen hippo capsizing your mokoro.

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:53.873
These are the scenes
moments after a hippo did just that --

00:05:53.897 --> 00:05:56.177
thrusting its tusks
through the hull of my boat.

00:05:56.201 --> 00:05:57.886
You can see the two holes --

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.992
puncture wounds in the base of the hull --

00:06:00.016 --> 00:06:01.740
absolutely terrifying

00:06:01.764 --> 00:06:03.910
and completely my fault.

00:06:03.934 --> 00:06:05.297
(Laughter)

00:06:05.321 --> 00:06:07.404
Many, many portages,

00:06:07.428 --> 00:06:11.130
tree blockages
and capsizes in rocky rapids.

00:06:12.904 --> 00:06:15.025
You're living on rice and beans,

00:06:15.049 --> 00:06:16.959
bathing in a bucket of cold water

00:06:16.983 --> 00:06:19.814
and paddling a marathon
six to eight hours every single day.

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:21.806
After 121 days of this,

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.157
I'd forgotten the PIN numbers
to my bank accounts

00:06:24.181 --> 00:06:25.631
and logins for social media --

00:06:25.655 --> 00:06:27.685
a complete systems reboot.

00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:30.554
You ask me now if I miss it,

00:06:30.578 --> 00:06:32.871
and I will tell you I am still there.

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:36.310
Now why do we need to save
places we hardly ever go?

00:06:36.653 --> 00:06:38.402
Why do we need to save places

00:06:38.426 --> 00:06:40.525
where you have to risk
your life to be there?

00:06:40.549 --> 00:06:44.793
Now, I'm not a religious
or particularly spiritual person,

00:06:44.817 --> 00:06:45.987
but in the wild,

00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:49.663
I believe I've experienced
the birthplace of religion.

00:06:50.336 --> 00:06:53.424
Standing in front of an elephant
far away from anywhere

00:06:53.448 --> 00:06:56.464
is the closest I will ever get to God.

00:06:57.258 --> 00:06:59.603
Moses, Buddha, Muhammad, Jesus,

00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:01.911
the Hindu teachers, prophets and mystics,

00:07:01.935 --> 00:07:03.443
all went into the wilderness --

00:07:03.467 --> 00:07:05.340
up into the mountains, into the desert,

00:07:05.364 --> 00:07:07.594
to sit quietly and listen
for those secrets

00:07:07.618 --> 00:07:10.131
that were to guide
their societies for millennia.

00:07:10.155 --> 00:07:12.665
I go into the Okavango on my mokoro.

00:07:13.204 --> 00:07:14.824
You must join me one day.

00:07:16.522 --> 00:07:19.512
Over 50 percent of the remaining
wilderness is unprotected.

00:07:19.936 --> 00:07:21.848
A huge opportunity --

00:07:21.872 --> 00:07:23.483
a chance for us all.

00:07:25.253 --> 00:07:27.678
We need to act with great urgency.

00:07:27.702 --> 00:07:30.087
Since the 2015 megatransect,

00:07:30.111 --> 00:07:33.169
we have explored all major rivers
of the Okavango River basin,

00:07:33.193 --> 00:07:37.126
covering a life-changing 4,000 miles
of detailed research transects

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.440
on our dugout canoes

00:07:38.464 --> 00:07:40.481
and our fat-tire mountain bikes.

00:07:40.505 --> 00:07:42.977
We now have 57 top scientists

00:07:43.001 --> 00:07:46.978
rediscovering what we call
the Okavango-Zambezi water tower --

00:07:47.002 --> 00:07:53.647
this vast, post-war wilderness
with undocumented source lakes,

00:07:53.671 --> 00:07:58.186
unnamed waterfalls in what is Africa's
largest remaining Miombo woodland.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.242
We've now discovered
24 new species to science

00:08:02.266 --> 00:08:04.532
and hundreds of species
not known to be there.

00:08:05.124 --> 00:08:08.346
This year, we start the process,
with the Angolan government,

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:12.170
to establish one of the largest systems
of protected areas in the world

00:08:12.194 --> 00:08:14.596
to preserve the
Okavango-Zambezi water tower

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:15.795
we have been exploring.

00:08:15.819 --> 00:08:19.766
Downstream, this represents
water security for millions of people

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:23.107
and more than half of the elephants
remaining on this planet.

00:08:23.131 --> 00:08:27.238
There is no doubt this is the biggest
conservation opportunity in Africa

00:08:27.262 --> 00:08:28.508
in decades.

00:08:28.532 --> 00:08:29.942
Over the next 10 to 15 years,

00:08:29.966 --> 00:08:32.239
we need to make
an unprecedented investment

00:08:32.263 --> 00:08:34.769
in the preservation
of wilderness around the world.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:36.498
To me,

00:08:36.522 --> 00:08:41.181
preserving wilderness is far more
than simply protecting ecosystems

00:08:41.205 --> 00:08:44.196
that clean the water we drink
and create the air we breathe.

00:08:44.682 --> 00:08:48.962
Preserving wilderness protects
our basic human right to be wild --

00:08:48.986 --> 00:08:51.643
our basic human rights to explore.

00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:53.471
Thank you.

00:08:53.495 --> 00:09:00.158
(Applause)
