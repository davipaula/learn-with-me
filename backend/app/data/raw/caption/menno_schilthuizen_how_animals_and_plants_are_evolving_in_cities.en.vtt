00:00:13.127 --> 00:00:14.727
This is where I grew up.

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:17.452
A small village near the city of Rotterdam

00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:18.912
in the Netherlands.

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:23.643
In the 1970s and 1980s,
when I was a teenager,

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:25.458
this area was still a quiet place.

00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:29.675
It was full of farms and fields
and swampland,

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.783
and I spent my free time there,
enjoying myself,

00:00:33.807 --> 00:00:36.189
painting oil paintings like this one,

00:00:36.213 --> 00:00:38.834
collecting wildflowers, bird-watching

00:00:38.858 --> 00:00:41.721
and also collecting insects.

00:00:41.745 --> 00:00:43.816
And this was one of my prized finds.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.537
This is a very special beetle,

00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:48.077
an amazing beetle called an ant beetle.

00:00:48.442 --> 00:00:51.371
And this is a kind of beetle
that lives its entire life

00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:53.308
inside an ant's nest.

00:00:53.332 --> 00:00:56.376
It has evolved to speak ant.

00:00:56.688 --> 00:00:59.409
It's using the same chemical signals,

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:02.387
the same smells as the ants do,
for communicating,

00:01:02.411 --> 00:01:05.583
and right now, this beetle
is telling this worker ant,

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:07.898
"Hey, I'm also a worker ant,

00:01:07.922 --> 00:01:09.692
I'm hungry, please feed me."

00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:11.242
And the ant complies,

00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:13.891
because the beetle is using
the same chemicals.

00:01:13.915 --> 00:01:15.676
Over these millions of years,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.870
this beetle has evolved a way
to live inside an ant society.

00:01:21.554 --> 00:01:22.712
Over the years,

00:01:22.736 --> 00:01:24.379
when I was living in that village,

00:01:24.403 --> 00:01:27.537
I collected 20,000 different beetles,

00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:31.096
and I built a collection
of pinned beetles.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.397
And this got me interested,
at a very early age, in evolution.

00:01:35.421 --> 00:01:40.953
How do all those different forms,
how does all this diversity come about?

00:01:41.625 --> 00:01:44.998
So I became an evolutionary biologist,

00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:46.760
like Charles Darwin.

00:01:46.784 --> 00:01:50.572
And like Charles Darwin,
I also soon became frustrated

00:01:50.596 --> 00:01:55.149
by the fact that evolution is something
that happened mostly in the past.

00:01:55.173 --> 00:01:58.597
We study the patterns that we see today,

00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:02.033
trying to understand the evolution
that took place in the past,

00:02:02.057 --> 00:02:05.918
but we can never actually see it
taking place in real time.

00:02:05.942 --> 00:02:07.671
We cannot observe it.

00:02:07.695 --> 00:02:10.322
As Darwin himself already said,

00:02:10.346 --> 00:02:13.371
"We see nothing of these slow
changes in progress,

00:02:13.395 --> 00:02:17.404
until the hand of time
has marked the lapse of ages."

00:02:18.293 --> 00:02:19.443
Or do we?

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:21.777
Over the past few decades,

00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:25.730
evolutionary biologists
have come to realize that sometimes,

00:02:25.754 --> 00:02:30.966
evolution proceeds much faster
and it can actually be observed,

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.688
especially when the environment
changes drastically

00:02:34.712 --> 00:02:37.752
and the need to adapt is great.

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.561
And of course, these days,

00:02:40.585 --> 00:02:44.057
great environmental changes
are usually caused by us.

00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:47.968
We mow, we irrigate, we plow, we build,

00:02:47.992 --> 00:02:51.051
we pump greenhouse gases
into the atmosphere

00:02:51.075 --> 00:02:52.574
that change the climate.

00:02:52.598 --> 00:02:55.387
We release exotic plants and animals

00:02:55.411 --> 00:02:57.434
in places where they didn't live before,

00:02:57.458 --> 00:03:03.164
and we harvest fish and trees and game
for our food and other needs.

00:03:04.102 --> 00:03:10.039
And all these environmental changes
reach their epicenter in cities.

00:03:10.555 --> 00:03:15.151
Cities form a completely new habitat
that we have created.

00:03:15.175 --> 00:03:18.516
And we clothe it in brick and concrete
and glass and steel,

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.690
which are impervious surfaces

00:03:20.714 --> 00:03:24.175
that plants can only root in
with the greatest difficulty.

00:03:25.141 --> 00:03:27.982
Also in cities, we find
the greatest concentrations

00:03:28.006 --> 00:03:29.585
of chemical pollution,

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.577
of artificial light and noise.

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.116
And we find wild mixtures
of plants and animals

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.725
from all over the world
that live in the city,

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:40.814
because they have escaped
from the gardening

00:03:40.838 --> 00:03:43.029
and aquarium and pet trade.

00:03:43.585 --> 00:03:47.347
And what does a species do

00:03:47.371 --> 00:03:51.459
when it lives in a completely
changed environment?

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:55.975
Well, many, of course, go, sadly, extinct.

00:03:56.285 --> 00:03:58.484
But the ones that don't go extinct,

00:03:58.508 --> 00:04:01.213
they adapt in spectacular ways.

00:04:02.188 --> 00:04:04.569
Biologists these days
are beginning to realize

00:04:04.593 --> 00:04:08.776
that cities are today's
pressure cookers of evolution.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.022
These are places
where wild animals and plants

00:04:12.046 --> 00:04:15.442
are evolving under our eyes very rapidly

00:04:15.466 --> 00:04:18.752
to suit these new, urban conditions.

00:04:18.776 --> 00:04:22.425
Exactly like the ant beetle did
millions of years ago,

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.822
when it moved inside an ant colony.

00:04:24.846 --> 00:04:29.584
We now find animals and plants
that have moved inside the human colony

00:04:29.608 --> 00:04:31.674
and are adapting to our cities.

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:33.561
And in doing so,

00:04:33.585 --> 00:04:35.259
we're also beginning to realize

00:04:35.283 --> 00:04:38.743
that evolution can actually
proceed very fast.

00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:42.149
It does not always take
the long lapse of ages;

00:04:42.173 --> 00:04:44.839
it can happen under our very eyes.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.882
This, for example,
is the white-footed mouse.

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:52.696
This is a native mammal
from the area around New York,

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.799
and more than 400 years ago,
before the city was built,

00:04:55.823 --> 00:04:57.934
this mouse lived everywhere.

00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:02.235
But these days, they are stuck
in little islands of green,

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:07.774
the city's parks, surrounded by a sea
of tarmac and traffic.

00:05:08.893 --> 00:05:14.015
A bit like a modern-day version
of Darwin's finches on the Galapagos.

00:05:15.744 --> 00:05:17.990
And like Darwin's finches,

00:05:18.014 --> 00:05:22.188
the mice in each separate park
have started evolving,

00:05:22.212 --> 00:05:25.307
have started to become
different from each other.

00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:27.553
And this is my colleague,
Jason Munshi-South,

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:29.307
from Fordham University,

00:05:29.331 --> 00:05:30.815
who is studying this process.

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:34.680
He is studying the DNA
of the white-footed mice

00:05:34.704 --> 00:05:36.839
in New York City's parks,

00:05:36.863 --> 00:05:40.506
and trying to understand
how they are beginning to evolve

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.069
in that archipelago of islands.

00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:45.769
And he's using a kind of
DNA fingerprinting, and he says,

00:05:45.793 --> 00:05:47.688
"If somebody gives me a mouse,

00:05:47.712 --> 00:05:49.791
doesn't tell me where it's from,

00:05:49.815 --> 00:05:51.228
just by looking at its DNA,

00:05:51.252 --> 00:05:54.133
I can tell exactly
from which park it comes."

00:05:54.157 --> 00:05:56.690
That's how different they have become.

00:05:57.395 --> 00:06:01.140
And Jason has also discovered
that those changes,

00:06:01.164 --> 00:06:02.498
these evolutionary changes,

00:06:02.522 --> 00:06:05.315
are not random, they mean something.

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:08.490
For example, in Central Park,

00:06:08.514 --> 00:06:10.996
we find that the mice have evolved genes

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.258
that allow them to deal
with very fatty food.

00:06:15.258 --> 00:06:16.956
Human food.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.805
Twenty-five million people
visit Central Park each year.

00:06:19.829 --> 00:06:22.583
It's the most heavily visited park
in North America.

00:06:22.607 --> 00:06:25.392
And those people leave behind snack food

00:06:25.416 --> 00:06:27.996
and peanuts and junk food,

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.027
and the mice have started feeding on that,

00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:33.022
and it's a completely different diet
than what they're used to,

00:06:33.046 --> 00:06:34.212
and over the years,

00:06:34.236 --> 00:06:37.878
they have evolved to suit
this very fatty, very human diet.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.426
And this is another city slicker animal.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.776
This is the European garden snail.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.982
A very common snail,

00:06:45.006 --> 00:06:48.751
it comes in all kinds of color variations,

00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:52.307
ranging from pale yellow to dark brown.

00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:55.315
And those colors are completely determined

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:56.823
by the snail's DNA.

00:06:57.514 --> 00:07:02.421
And those colors also determine
the heat management of the snail

00:07:02.445 --> 00:07:04.379
that lives inside that shell.

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:07.667
For example, a snail
that sits in the sunlight,

00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:08.850
in the bright sun,

00:07:08.874 --> 00:07:10.996
if it has a pale yellow shell,

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:17.266
it doesn't heat up as much as a snail
that sits inside a dark brown shell.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.316
Just like when you're sitting
in a white car, you stay cooler

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.196
than when you're sitting
inside a black car.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.348
Now there is a phenomenon called
the urban heat islands,

00:07:27.372 --> 00:07:30.315
which means that in the center
of a big city,

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:33.014
the temperature can be
several degrees higher

00:07:33.038 --> 00:07:34.434
than outside of the big city.

00:07:34.458 --> 00:07:35.815
That has to do with the fact

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:38.529
that you have these concentrations
of millions of people,

00:07:38.553 --> 00:07:40.783
and all their activities
and their machineries,

00:07:40.807 --> 00:07:42.022
they generate heat.

00:07:42.046 --> 00:07:45.720
Also, the wind is blocked
by the tall buildings,

00:07:45.744 --> 00:07:50.053
and all the steel and brick
and concrete absorb the solar heat

00:07:50.077 --> 00:07:51.678
and they radiate it out at night.

00:07:51.702 --> 00:07:54.966
So you get this bubble of hot air
in the center of a big city,

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.806
and my students and I figured
that maybe those garden snails,

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:01.522
with their variable shells,

00:08:01.546 --> 00:08:05.850
are adapting to the urban heat islands.

00:08:05.874 --> 00:08:07.660
Maybe in the center of a city,

00:08:07.684 --> 00:08:10.557
we find that the shell color is evolving

00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:14.017
in a direction to reduce
overheating of the snails.

00:08:14.367 --> 00:08:17.870
And to study this, we started
a citizen-science project.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.805
We built a free smartphone app,

00:08:20.829 --> 00:08:23.034
which allowed people
all over the Netherlands

00:08:23.058 --> 00:08:26.027
to take pictures of snails
in their garden, in their street,

00:08:26.051 --> 00:08:27.870
also in the countryside,

00:08:27.894 --> 00:08:31.403
and upload them to a citizen
science web platform.

00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:34.474
And over a year, we got 10,000 pictures

00:08:34.498 --> 00:08:37.133
of snails that had been photographed
in the Netherlands,

00:08:37.157 --> 00:08:39.647
and when we started analyzing the results,

00:08:39.671 --> 00:08:43.363
we found that indeed,
our suspicions were confirmed.

00:08:43.387 --> 00:08:45.751
In the center of the urban heat islands,

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:51.776
we find that the snails have evolved
more yellow, more lighter-colored shells.

00:08:54.341 --> 00:08:57.309
Now the city snail and the Manhattan mouse

00:08:57.333 --> 00:09:03.093
are just two examples
of a growing list of animals and plants

00:09:03.117 --> 00:09:06.434
that have evolved to suit
this new habitat,

00:09:06.458 --> 00:09:09.450
this city habitat that we have created.

00:09:09.832 --> 00:09:12.705
And in a book that I've written
about this subject,

00:09:12.729 --> 00:09:14.236
the subject of urban evolution,

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.681
I give many more examples.

00:09:15.705 --> 00:09:18.466
For example, weeds that have evolved seeds

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.879
that are better at germinating
on the pavement.

00:09:21.903 --> 00:09:25.410
Grasshoppers that have evolved a song

00:09:25.434 --> 00:09:28.966
that has a higher pitch
when they live close to noisy traffic.

00:09:29.553 --> 00:09:34.887
Mosquitoes that have evolved
to feed on the blood of human commuters

00:09:34.911 --> 00:09:37.252
inside metro stations.

00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:40.037
And even the common city pigeon

00:09:40.061 --> 00:09:43.005
that has evolved ways to detox themselves

00:09:43.029 --> 00:09:47.259
from heavy-metal pollution
by putting it in their feathers.

00:09:47.743 --> 00:09:50.085
Biologists like myself,
all over the world,

00:09:50.109 --> 00:09:53.156
are becoming interested
in this fascinating process

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.347
of urban evolution.

00:09:54.371 --> 00:09:58.299
We are realizing that we're really
at a unique event

00:09:58.323 --> 00:10:00.221
in the history of life on earth.

00:10:00.245 --> 00:10:02.752
A completely new ecosystem

00:10:02.776 --> 00:10:07.772
that is evolving and adapting
to a habitat that we have created.

00:10:09.181 --> 00:10:10.840
And not just academics --

00:10:10.864 --> 00:10:14.650
we're also beginning to enlist
the millions of pairs of hands

00:10:14.674 --> 00:10:17.038
and ears and eyes
that are present in the city.

00:10:17.062 --> 00:10:20.135
Citizen scientists, schoolchildren --

00:10:20.159 --> 00:10:21.343
together with them,

00:10:21.367 --> 00:10:24.405
we are building
a global observation network

00:10:24.429 --> 00:10:28.786
which allows us to watch this process
of urban evolution taking place

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:30.135
in real time.

00:10:31.323 --> 00:10:34.799
And at the same time,
this also makes it clear to people

00:10:34.823 --> 00:10:37.561
that evolution is not
just some abstract thing

00:10:37.585 --> 00:10:40.431
that you need to travel
to the Galapagos to study,

00:10:40.455 --> 00:10:45.099
or that you need to be a paleontologist
to understand what it is.

00:10:45.123 --> 00:10:48.186
It's a very ordinary biological process

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.633
that's taking place
all the time, everywhere.

00:10:51.657 --> 00:10:54.228
In your backyard,
in the street where you live,

00:10:54.252 --> 00:10:56.252
right outside of this theater.

00:10:56.729 --> 00:11:00.783
But there is, of course,
a flip side to my enthusiasm.

00:11:00.807 --> 00:11:03.482
When I go back to the village
where I grew up,

00:11:03.506 --> 00:11:08.529
I no longer find those fields and swamps
that I knew from my youth.

00:11:08.553 --> 00:11:10.450
The village has now been absorbed

00:11:10.474 --> 00:11:13.156
by the growing
conglomeration of Rotterdam,

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.656
and instead, I find shopping malls

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.791
and I find suburbs and bus lanes.

00:11:18.815 --> 00:11:22.410
And many of the animals and plants
that I was so accustomed to

00:11:22.434 --> 00:11:26.169
have disappeared,
including perhaps that ant beetle.

00:11:27.449 --> 00:11:30.553
But I take comfort in the fact
that the children growing up

00:11:30.577 --> 00:11:32.581
in that village today

00:11:32.605 --> 00:11:36.468
may no longer be experiencing
that traditional nature

00:11:36.492 --> 00:11:37.680
that I grew up with,

00:11:37.704 --> 00:11:39.950
but they're surrounded
by a new type of nature,

00:11:39.974 --> 00:11:41.815
a new type of ecosystem,

00:11:41.839 --> 00:11:45.903
that, to them, might be just as exciting
as the old type was to me.

00:11:45.927 --> 00:11:49.625
They are living in a new,
modern-day Galapagos.

00:11:49.649 --> 00:11:53.182
And by teaming up with citizen scientists

00:11:53.206 --> 00:11:56.558
and with evolutionary
biologists like myself,

00:11:56.582 --> 00:12:00.344
they might become the Darwins
of the 21st century,

00:12:00.368 --> 00:12:02.748
studying urban evolution.

00:12:03.114 --> 00:12:04.281
Thank you.

00:12:04.305 --> 00:12:06.503
(Applause)
