00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.643
Of all the characters
in all the Disney films

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:18.958
the one I love the most
is Jiminy Cricket from "Pinocchio."

00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:21.768
My favorite scene in the movie

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:24.809
is when the blue fairy
is saying to Pinocchio,

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:27.476
"Always let your conscience
be your guide."

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.851
Pinocchio asks, "What are conscience?"

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:32.476
and Jiminy Cricket
is scandalized by the question.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.809
"What are conscience!

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:35.309
What are conscience!

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:39.309
Conscience is that still, small voice
that people won't listen to.

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.875
That's just the trouble
with the world today."

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:46.143
I love the way Jiminy Cricket
is always there

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:49.226
with a nerdy, ethical thing

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.184
just as Pinocchio's coming up
with some kind of good plan.

00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:56.143
I think of him as speaking
truth to puppet.

00:00:56.167 --> 00:00:58.643
I always wondered what it was
about Jiminy Cricket

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:00.101
that made me love him so much

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:01.393
and one day it hit me.

00:01:01.417 --> 00:01:03.583
It was because he sounds
like my grandfather.

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:07.809
My grandfather was
a very sweet and cuddly man,

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:10.292
and I loved him to the moon and back.

00:01:11.417 --> 00:01:14.143
But I shared him with a big, wide world.

00:01:14.167 --> 00:01:15.893
His name was Roy O. Disney,

00:01:15.917 --> 00:01:18.518
and together with his younger
brother Walt Disney,

00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:22.393
he came from a very humble
upbringing in Kansas

00:01:22.417 --> 00:01:26.792
and started and ran one of the most
iconic businesses in the world.

00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:30.726
Two things I remember the best
about going to Disneyland

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.101
with my grandfather.

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:35.559
The first thing was
he always gave me a stern warning

00:01:35.583 --> 00:01:38.268
that if I ever sassed
anybody who worked there,

00:01:38.292 --> 00:01:40.667
I was in deep doo-doo when we got home.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.351
He said, "these people work really hard --

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:45.768
harder than you can imagine,

00:01:45.792 --> 00:01:47.792
and they deserve your respect."

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.809
The other is that he never
walked by a piece of garbage,

00:01:52.833 --> 00:01:54.976
inside of Disneyland or anywhere else,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.309
where he didn't bend over to pick it up.

00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:00.708
He said, "no one's too good
to pick up a piece of garbage."

00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:03.434
In Grandpa's day,

00:02:03.458 --> 00:02:05.958
a job at Disneyland was not a gig.

00:02:06.917 --> 00:02:09.184
A person could expect to own a home,

00:02:09.208 --> 00:02:10.809
raise a family,

00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:13.434
access decent health care,

00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:17.184
retire in some security without worrying

00:02:17.208 --> 00:02:20.184
on just what he earned there at the park.

00:02:20.208 --> 00:02:22.559
Mind you, Grandpa fought the unions,

00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:23.958
and he fought them hard.

00:02:24.583 --> 00:02:26.559
He said he didn't like to be forced

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:29.143
to do something
he wanted to do voluntarily.

00:02:29.167 --> 00:02:33.518
That was rank paternalism of course
and maybe even a tiny bit of BS.

00:02:33.542 --> 00:02:35.125
He wasn't an angel,

00:02:35.917 --> 00:02:39.059
and everyone wasn't well
and fairly treated across the company,

00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:40.542
something that's well-known.

00:02:42.208 --> 00:02:47.101
But I think in his core
he had a very deep commitment

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:51.542
to the idea that he had a moral obligation
to every human being that worked for him.

00:02:52.417 --> 00:02:56.667
That actually wasn't such an uncommon
attitude for CEOs of the day.

00:02:57.542 --> 00:03:01.059
But when my grandfather died in 1971,

00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:03.518
a new mindset was beginning to take hold

00:03:03.542 --> 00:03:07.125
of the American and eventually
the global imagination.

00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:11.934
Jiminy Cricket got shown the door
by economist Milton Friedman,

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:13.226
among others,

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.250
who popularized the idea
of shareholder primacy.

00:03:17.167 --> 00:03:22.333
Now, shareholder primacy is a pretty
reasonable idea when you think about it.

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:24.934
Shareholders own the company,

00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:29.226
shareholders want profits and growth,

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.559
so therefore you prioritize
profits and growth.

00:03:32.583 --> 00:03:34.434
Very sensible.

00:03:34.458 --> 00:03:38.976
But unfortunately, shareholder primacy
was an idea that became a mindset

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.559
and then that mindset jumped the rails,

00:03:41.583 --> 00:03:44.684
and it came to fundamentally
alter everything

00:03:44.708 --> 00:03:47.184
about the way companies
and even governments

00:03:47.208 --> 00:03:49.167
were led and managed.

00:03:50.333 --> 00:03:53.726
Milton Friedman's pivotal op-ed
in the "New York Times"

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.559
was followed by decades
of concerted organizing and lobbying

00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:01.518
by business-focused activists

00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:06.434
along with a sustained assault
on every law and regulation

00:04:06.458 --> 00:04:11.083
that had once held businesses'
worst impulses in check.

00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:13.226
And soon enough,

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.518
this new mindset had taken hold
across every business school

00:04:16.542 --> 00:04:18.042
and across every sector.

00:04:18.917 --> 00:04:22.893
Profits were to be pursued
by any means necessary,

00:04:22.917 --> 00:04:25.184
unions were kneecapped,

00:04:25.208 --> 00:04:26.518
taxes were slashed,

00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:27.851
and with the same machete,

00:04:27.875 --> 00:04:29.976
so was the safety net.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.268
I don't need to tell you
about the inequality

00:04:32.292 --> 00:04:34.375
that's been the result of these shifts.

00:04:35.042 --> 00:04:37.018
We all know the story well.

00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:40.976
The bottom line is that everything
that turns a gig into a livelihood

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.018
was stripped away from an American worker.

00:04:44.042 --> 00:04:45.351
Job security,

00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:46.684
paid sick days,

00:04:46.708 --> 00:04:48.018
vacation time --

00:04:48.042 --> 00:04:49.309
all of that went away

00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:54.518
even as the wealthy saw their net worths
bloat to unprecedented,

00:04:54.542 --> 00:04:57.393
and yes, unusable levels.

00:04:57.417 --> 00:05:00.851
Although if you're Scrooge McDuck
you could change it all into gold coins

00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:02.167
and backstroke through it.

00:05:03.125 --> 00:05:05.625
So let me just address
the Dumbo in the room.

00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:10.458
Yes, I am criticizing the company
that bears my family's name.

00:05:11.542 --> 00:05:13.708
Yes, I think Disney can do better.

00:05:14.375 --> 00:05:18.559
And I believe that many of the thousands
of magnificent people

00:05:18.583 --> 00:05:20.809
who work at the Walt Disney Company

00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:23.958
wish that it would do better
just as much as I do.

00:05:24.833 --> 00:05:26.684
For almost a century,

00:05:26.708 --> 00:05:28.809
Disney has turned a pretty profit

00:05:28.833 --> 00:05:32.601
on the idea that families
are a kind of magic,

00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:34.851
that love is important,

00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:36.667
that imaginations matter.

00:05:37.208 --> 00:05:39.393
That's why it turns
your stomach a little bit

00:05:39.417 --> 00:05:42.934
when I tell you that Cinderella
might be sleeping in her car.

00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.875
But let's be very clear:
this is not just about Disney.

00:05:47.167 --> 00:05:50.268
This is structural and this is systemic.

00:05:50.292 --> 00:05:53.851
No single CEO on his own is culpable

00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:57.434
and no single company
has the wherewithal to buck this.

00:05:57.458 --> 00:05:58.976
The analysts, the pundits,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.309
the politicians,

00:06:00.333 --> 00:06:03.143
the business school curricula
and the social norms

00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:06.476
drive the shape
of the contemporary economy.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.059
Disney is just doing
what everybody else does,

00:06:09.083 --> 00:06:11.018
and they're not even the worst offender.

00:06:11.042 --> 00:06:15.601
If I told you how bad it was for workers
at Amazon or McDonald's or Walmart,

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:19.143
or any one of a thousand other places
you've never heard of,

00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:23.726
it's not going to hit you as viscerally
as if I tell you that 73 percent,

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.393
or three out of four of the people
who smile when you walk in,

00:06:27.417 --> 00:06:30.059
who help you comfort that crying baby,

00:06:30.083 --> 00:06:33.684
who maybe help you have the best
vacation you ever have,

00:06:33.708 --> 00:06:36.167
can't consistently put food on the table.

00:06:37.167 --> 00:06:39.458
It's supposed to be
the happiest place on earth.

00:06:40.583 --> 00:06:43.851
And the people who work there
take incredible pride

00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:46.559
that they pursue a higher purpose.

00:06:46.583 --> 00:06:47.851
It's a higher purpose

00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:51.851
that both my grandfather
and great-uncle very intentionally built

00:06:51.875 --> 00:06:56.333
when they made it a place that honors
an interaction over a transaction.

00:06:57.625 --> 00:07:00.601
Now, I know that a word like magic
makes you wonder

00:07:00.625 --> 00:07:02.500
if I've taken leave of my senses.

00:07:03.417 --> 00:07:07.268
I know it's hard to imagine
that something as ephemeral as love

00:07:07.292 --> 00:07:10.351
can support a brand as big as Disney,

00:07:10.375 --> 00:07:12.184
and I know that it's hard to imagine

00:07:12.208 --> 00:07:16.851
that things as unquantifiable
as moral obligations

00:07:16.875 --> 00:07:18.518
should have any call on us

00:07:18.542 --> 00:07:21.917
when we seek to deliver
value to our investors.

00:07:22.958 --> 00:07:26.875
But accounting and finance
don't run the world.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.226
Beliefs,

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.601
mindsets --

00:07:30.625 --> 00:07:33.143
those are what drive business ethics.

00:07:33.167 --> 00:07:36.559
And if we're going to change
those mindsets and belief systems,

00:07:36.583 --> 00:07:39.768
we're going to have to use the most
Disney superpower out there.

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:42.476
We're going to have to use
our imaginations.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.750
You're going to have to invite
Jiminy Cricket back to the party.

00:07:47.125 --> 00:07:50.375
Now, Jiminy Cricket might start
with some low-hanging fruit,

00:07:51.333 --> 00:07:53.601
like, greed is not good,

00:07:53.625 --> 00:07:57.601
like the world is not divided
into makers and takers,

00:07:57.625 --> 00:07:59.226
and that nobody ever,

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.518
without any help,

00:08:00.542 --> 00:08:02.809
pulled themselves up
by their own bootstraps --

00:08:02.833 --> 00:08:05.958
if you know anything about physics
you'll understand why that is.

00:08:07.208 --> 00:08:11.018
Jiminy might remind us that every
single person who works for us,

00:08:11.042 --> 00:08:12.851
without exception,

00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:14.851
whether they fill out the spreadsheets

00:08:14.875 --> 00:08:16.601
or change the bedsheets,

00:08:16.625 --> 00:08:20.601
deserves the respect
and dignity of living wage.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.458
It's as simple as that.

00:08:22.917 --> 00:08:26.559
And Jiminy might wonder
how managers and employees

00:08:26.583 --> 00:08:31.184
could possibly have any kind
of empathy for each other

00:08:31.208 --> 00:08:34.851
when their workplaces
have become so segregated

00:08:34.875 --> 00:08:37.143
that it seems normal and natural

00:08:37.167 --> 00:08:40.809
that an executive needs
an especially swanky place to park

00:08:40.833 --> 00:08:42.893
or eat or go to the bathroom

00:08:42.917 --> 00:08:47.059
or that an executive is too good
to pick up a piece of garbage.

00:08:47.083 --> 00:08:52.250
We are, after all, just the one species
living together on just the one planet.

00:08:53.292 --> 00:08:57.684
Jiminy might ask us
to question some of our dogma.

00:08:57.708 --> 00:09:02.518
Does a CEO really need to be paid
as much or more than every other CEO

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:04.976
or is that just creating
a competitive dynamic

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.250
that's driving numbers
into the stratosphere?

00:09:08.208 --> 00:09:12.351
He might wonder if boards really do know
all that they really need to know

00:09:12.375 --> 00:09:15.542
when they don't have frontline workers
ever at their meetings.

00:09:16.708 --> 00:09:19.833
He might ask if there's such a thing
as too much money.

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:24.226
Or he might wonder
if maybe we can make common cause

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.268
with consumers, with workers,

00:09:26.292 --> 00:09:28.184
with companies, with communities,

00:09:28.208 --> 00:09:30.018
for all of us to come together

00:09:30.042 --> 00:09:33.893
to redefine this incredibly narrow idea

00:09:33.917 --> 00:09:36.958
of what the purpose
of a company really is.

00:09:38.458 --> 00:09:43.351
Jiminy would want us to remember
that nobody works in a vacuum,

00:09:43.375 --> 00:09:45.768
that the men and women who run companies

00:09:45.792 --> 00:09:50.184
actively cocreate the reality
we all have to share.

00:09:50.208 --> 00:09:52.393
And just like with global warming,

00:09:52.417 --> 00:09:56.393
we are, each of us, responsible
for the collective consequences

00:09:56.417 --> 00:09:59.125
of our individual decisions and actions.

00:10:00.417 --> 00:10:03.768
I believe that the most profitable
business ecosystem

00:10:03.792 --> 00:10:05.143
in the history of the world

00:10:05.167 --> 00:10:06.434
can do better.

00:10:06.458 --> 00:10:10.226
I believe we can take
just a little bit off of the upside,

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:14.601
take a tiny bit of pressure off
the speed at which things are happening.

00:10:14.625 --> 00:10:17.518
I believe that everything
we lose in the short-term

00:10:17.542 --> 00:10:19.351
will more than make up for itself

00:10:19.375 --> 00:10:25.000
in an expanded landscape of moral,
spiritual and financial prosperity.

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:28.143
I know what the cynics say, and it's true:

00:10:28.167 --> 00:10:30.184
you can't eat your principles.

00:10:30.208 --> 00:10:32.726
But you can't breathe
a basis point either,

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.208
and neither can your children.

00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:38.726
I know I idolized my grandfather
probably too much.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.934
He worked in very different times

00:10:40.958 --> 00:10:43.309
and those are times
none of us want to go back to

00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:45.684
for all kinds of good reasons.

00:10:45.708 --> 00:10:48.934
I know there are a lot of CEOs today
who are just as well-meaning

00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:51.726
and just as decent as my grandfather was,

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.893
but they're working at a time
with very different expectations

00:10:54.917 --> 00:10:57.250
and much more cutthroat context.

00:10:57.958 --> 00:10:59.643
But here's the good news.

00:10:59.667 --> 00:11:03.309
Expectations and contexts are made

00:11:03.333 --> 00:11:05.559
and they can be unmade, too.

00:11:05.583 --> 00:11:08.559
There is so much to learn
from the simple integrity

00:11:08.583 --> 00:11:11.792
of how my grandfather
understood his job as CEO.

00:11:12.625 --> 00:11:15.976
Behind every theme park
and every stuffed animal,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.958
a handful of principles
governed everything.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.917
Every single person
deserves respect and dignity.

00:11:25.042 --> 00:11:28.768
No one is too good
to pick up a piece of garbage,

00:11:28.792 --> 00:11:31.958
and always let conscience be your guide.

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:36.518
We could all do worse
than listen to Jiminy Cricket.

00:11:36.542 --> 00:11:37.792
Thank you.
