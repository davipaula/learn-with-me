00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.136
Computer algorithms today
are performing incredible tasks

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.896
with high accuracies, at a massive scale,
using human-like intelligence.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.856
And this intelligence of computers
is often referred to as AI

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.736
or artificial intelligence.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.960
AI is poised to make an incredible impact
on our lives in the future.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.816
Today, however,
we still face massive challenges

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.336
in detecting and diagnosing
several life-threatening illnesses,

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.720
such as infectious diseases and cancer.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.296
Thousands of patients every year

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.120
lose their lives
due to liver and oral cancer.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.576
Our best way to help these patients

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.920
is to perform early detection
and diagnoses of these diseases.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.040
So how do we detect these diseases today,
and can artificial intelligence help?

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.576
In patients who, unfortunately,
are suspected of these diseases,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.256
an expert physician first orders

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.896
very expensive
medical imaging technologies

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.016
such as fluorescent imaging,
CTs, MRIs, to be performed.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.336
Once those images are collected,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.880
another expert physician then diagnoses
those images and talks to the patient.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.976
As you can see, this is
a very resource-intensive process,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.416
requiring both expert physicians,
expensive medical imaging technologies,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.536
and is not considered practical
for the developing world.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.920
And in fact, in many
industrialized nations, as well.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.640
So, can we solve this problem
using artificial intelligence?

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.896
Today, if I were to use traditional
artificial intelligence architectures

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.136
to solve this problem,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.616
I would require 10,000 --

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.656
I repeat, on an order of 10,000
of these very expensive medical images

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.056
first to be generated.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.976
After that, I would then go
to an expert physician,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.496
who would then analyze
those images for me.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.616
And using those two pieces of information,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.296
I can train a standard deep neural network
or a deep learning network

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.456
to provide patient's diagnosis.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.216
Similar to the first approach,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.383
traditional artificial
intelligence approaches

00:02:13.407 --> 00:02:14.856
suffer from the same problem.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.440
Large amounts of data, expert physicians
and expert medical imaging technologies.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.616
So, can we invent more scalable, effective

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.936
and more valuable artificial
intelligence architectures

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.016
to solve these very important
problems facing us today?

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.336
And this is exactly
what my group at MIT Media Lab does.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.216
We have invented a variety
of unorthodox AI architectures

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.416
to solve some of the most important
challenges facing us today

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.640
in medical imaging and clinical trials.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.536
In the example I shared
with you today, we had two goals.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.536
Our first goal was to reduce
the number of images

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.816
required to train
artificial intelligence algorithms.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.936
Our second goal -- we were more ambitious,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.696
we wanted to reduce the use
of expensive medical imaging technologies

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:00.936
to screen patients.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.160
So how did we do it?

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.136
For our first goal,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.216
instead of starting
with tens and thousands

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.256
of these very expensive medical images,
like traditional AI,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.336
we started with a single medical image.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.136
From this image, my team and I
figured out a very clever way

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.896
to extract billions
of information packets.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.616
These information packets
included colors, pixels, geometry

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.176
and rendering of the disease
on the medical image.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.536
In a sense, we converted one image
into billions of training data points,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.096
massively reducing the amount of data
needed for training.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.336
For our second goal,

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.216
to reduce the use of expensive medical
imaging technologies to screen patients,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.096
we started with a standard,
white light photograph,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.456
acquired either from a DSLR camera
or a mobile phone, for the patient.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.936
Then remember those
billions of information packets?

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.496
We overlaid those from
the medical image onto this image,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.040
creating something
that we call a composite image.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.776
Much to our surprise,
we only required 50 --

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.136
I repeat, only 50 --

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.000
of these composite images to train
our algorithms to high efficiencies.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.016
To summarize our approach,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.216
instead of using 10,000
very expensive medical images,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.256
we can now train the AI algorithms
in an unorthodox way,

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.536
using only 50 of these high-resolution,
but standard photographs,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.056
acquired from DSLR cameras
and mobile phones,

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.616
and provide diagnosis.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.856
More importantly,

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.016
our algorithms can accept,
in the future and even right now,

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.856
some very simple, white light
photographs from the patient,

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.320
instead of expensive
medical imaging technologies.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.216
I believe that we are poised
to enter an era

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.176
where artificial intelligence

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.736
is going to make an incredible
impact on our future.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.216
And I think that thinking
about traditional AI,

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.016
which is data-rich but application-poor,

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.576
we should also continue thinking

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.616
about unorthodox artificial
intelligence architectures,

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.576
which can accept small amounts of data

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.536
and solve some of the most important
problems facing us today,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.816
especially in health care.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.056
Thank you very much.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.920
(Applause)
