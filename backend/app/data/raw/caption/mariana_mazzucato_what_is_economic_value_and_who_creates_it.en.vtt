00:00:12.865 --> 00:00:14.658
Value creation.

00:00:14.682 --> 00:00:15.983
Wealth creation.

00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:17.641
These are really powerful words.

00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:20.356
Maybe you think of finance,
you think of innovation,

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.225
you think of creativity.

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:24.439
But who are the value creators?

00:00:24.463 --> 00:00:28.399
If we use that word, we must be implying
that some people aren't creating value.

00:00:28.423 --> 00:00:29.582
Who are they?

00:00:29.606 --> 00:00:30.839
The couch potatoes?

00:00:30.863 --> 00:00:32.741
The value extractors?

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:34.540
The value destroyers?

00:00:34.564 --> 00:00:39.282
To answer this question, we actually
have to have a proper theory of value.

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:42.383
And I'm here as an economist
to break it to you

00:00:42.407 --> 00:00:44.810
that we've kind of lost our way
on this question.

00:00:44.834 --> 00:00:46.857
Now, don't look so surprised.

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:50.473
What I mean by that is,
we've stopped contesting it.

00:00:50.497 --> 00:00:53.282
We've stopped actually asking
really tough questions

00:00:53.306 --> 00:00:57.011
about what is the difference between
value creation and value extraction,

00:00:57.035 --> 00:00:59.071
productive and unproductive activities.

00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:01.446
Now, let me just give you
some context here.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.051
2009 was just about
a year and a half after

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:07.348
one of the biggest
financial crises of our time,

00:01:07.372 --> 00:01:11.163
second only to the 1929 Great Depression,

00:01:11.187 --> 00:01:13.890
and the CEO of Goldman Sachs said

00:01:13.914 --> 00:01:17.743
Goldman Sachs workers are the most
productive in the world.

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:20.193
Productivity and productiveness,
for an economist,

00:01:20.217 --> 00:01:21.967
actually has a lot to do with value.

00:01:21.991 --> 00:01:23.184
You're producing stuff,

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:25.484
you're producing it
dynamically and efficiently.

00:01:25.508 --> 00:01:28.896
You're also producing things
that the world needs, wants and buys.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.173
Now, how this could have been said
just one year after the crisis,

00:01:32.197 --> 00:01:35.330
which actually had this bank
as well as many other banks --

00:01:35.354 --> 00:01:37.644
I'm just kind of picking
on Goldman Sachs here --

00:01:37.668 --> 00:01:40.616
at the center of the crisis, because
they had actually produced

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.592
some pretty problematic financial products
mainly but not only related to mortgages,

00:01:45.616 --> 00:01:49.356
which saw many thousands of people
actually lose their homes.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.214
In 2010, in just one month, September,

00:01:52.238 --> 00:01:57.570
120,000 people lost their homes
through the foreclosures of that crisis.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.938
Between 2007 and 2010,

00:02:00.962 --> 00:02:03.510
8.8 million people lost their jobs.

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:08.395
The bank also had to then
be bailed out by the US taxpayer

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.474
for the sum of 10 billion dollars.

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:14.798
We didn't hear the taxpayers bragging
that they were value creators,

00:02:14.822 --> 00:02:16.411
but obviously, having bailed out

00:02:16.435 --> 00:02:19.052
one of the biggest value-creating
productive companies,

00:02:19.076 --> 00:02:20.341
perhaps they should have.

00:02:20.365 --> 00:02:23.488
What I want to do next
is kind of ask ourselves

00:02:23.512 --> 00:02:25.303
how we lost our way,

00:02:25.327 --> 00:02:26.686
how it could be, actually,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.224
that a statement like that
could almost go unnoticed,

00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:32.668
because it wasn't an after-dinner joke;
it was said very seriously.

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:37.698
So what I want to do is bring you back
300 years in economic thinking,

00:02:37.722 --> 00:02:40.376
when, actually, the term was contested.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.555
It doesn't mean that
they were right or wrong,

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.921
but you couldn't just call yourself
a value creator, a wealth creator.

00:02:45.945 --> 00:02:48.966
There was a lot of debate
within the economics profession.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.643
And what I want to argue is,
we've kind of lost our way,

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:55.054
and that has actually allowed this term,
"wealth creation" and "value,"

00:02:55.078 --> 00:02:57.462
to become quite weak and lazy

00:02:57.486 --> 00:02:59.308
and also easily captured.

00:02:59.614 --> 00:03:02.164
OK? So let's start --
I hate to break it to you --

00:03:02.188 --> 00:03:03.540
300 years ago.

00:03:03.564 --> 00:03:05.923
Now, what was interesting 300 years ago

00:03:05.947 --> 00:03:09.854
is the society was still
an agricultural type of society.

00:03:09.878 --> 00:03:12.962
So it's not surprising
that the economists of the time,

00:03:12.986 --> 00:03:14.607
who were called the Physiocrats,

00:03:14.631 --> 00:03:18.005
actually put the center
of their attention to farm labor.

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:20.319
When they said, "Where
does value come from?"

00:03:20.343 --> 00:03:21.725
they looked at farming.

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:25.244
And they produced what I think was
probably the world's first spreadsheet,

00:03:25.268 --> 00:03:27.104
called the "Tableau Economique,"

00:03:27.128 --> 00:03:31.154
and this was done by FranÃ§ois Quesnay,
one of the leaders of this movement.

00:03:31.178 --> 00:03:32.547
And it was very interesting,

00:03:32.571 --> 00:03:35.580
because they didn't just say,
"Farming is the source of value."

00:03:35.604 --> 00:03:38.642
They then really worried about
what was happening to that value

00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:39.834
when it was produced.

00:03:39.858 --> 00:03:41.545
What the Tableau Economique does --

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.177
and I've tried to make it
a bit simpler here for you --

00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:46.619
is it broke down the classes
in society into three.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:50.046
The farmers, creating value,
were called the "productive class."

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.810
Then others who were just
moving some of this value around

00:03:52.834 --> 00:03:54.560
but it was useful, it was necessary,

00:03:54.584 --> 00:03:55.782
these were the merchants;

00:03:55.806 --> 00:03:57.486
they were called the "proprietors."

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.072
And then there was another class
that was simply charging the farmers a fee

00:04:01.096 --> 00:04:03.281
for an existing asset, the land,

00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:05.833
and they called them the "sterile class."

00:04:05.857 --> 00:04:09.722
Now, this is a really heavy-hitting word
if you think what it means:

00:04:09.746 --> 00:04:13.574
that if too much of the resources
are going to the landlords,

00:04:13.598 --> 00:04:18.416
you're actually putting the reproduction
potential of the system at risk.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.670
And so all these little arrows there
were their way of simulating --

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:25.266
again, spreadsheets and simulators,
these guys were really using big data --

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.786
they were simulating what would
actually happen under different scenarios

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.277
if the wealth actually wasn't
reinvested back into production

00:04:32.301 --> 00:04:34.090
to make that land more productive

00:04:34.114 --> 00:04:36.675
and was actually being
siphoned out in different ways,

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.325
or even if the proprietors
were getting too much.

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:41.897
And what later happened in the 1800s,

00:04:41.897 --> 00:04:44.228
and this was no longer
the Agricultural Revolution

00:04:44.252 --> 00:04:45.777
but the Industrial Revolution,

00:04:45.801 --> 00:04:47.457
is that the classical economists,

00:04:47.481 --> 00:04:51.332
and these were Adam Smith, David Ricardo,
Karl Marx, the revolutionary,

00:04:51.356 --> 00:04:54.247
also asked the question "What is value?"

00:04:54.271 --> 00:04:57.191
But it's not surprising that
because they were actually living

00:04:57.215 --> 00:05:00.377
through an industrial era
with the rise of machines and factories,

00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:02.246
they said it was industrial labor.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.083
So they had a labor theory of value.

00:05:05.107 --> 00:05:07.191
But again, their focus was reproduction,

00:05:07.215 --> 00:05:10.367
this real worry of what was happening
to the value that was created

00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:11.980
if it was getting siphoned out.

00:05:12.004 --> 00:05:13.532
And in "The Wealth of Nations,"

00:05:13.556 --> 00:05:17.331
Adam Smith had this really great example
of the pin factory where he said

00:05:17.355 --> 00:05:20.351
if you only have one person
making every bit of the pin,

00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:22.923
at most you can make one pin a day.

00:05:22.947 --> 00:05:26.674
But if you actually invest in factory
production and the division of labor,

00:05:26.698 --> 00:05:27.858
new thinking --

00:05:27.882 --> 00:05:30.960
today, we would use the word
"organizational innovation" --

00:05:30.984 --> 00:05:32.957
then you could increase the productivity

00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:34.947
and the growth and the wealth of nations.

00:05:34.971 --> 00:05:37.430
So he showed that 10 specialized workers

00:05:37.454 --> 00:05:40.300
who had been invested in,
in their human capital,

00:05:40.324 --> 00:05:42.660
could produce 4,800 pins a day,

00:05:42.684 --> 00:05:45.696
as opposed to just one
by an unspecialized worker.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.324
And he and his fellow classical economists

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:51.700
also broke down activities
into productive and unproductive ones.

00:05:51.724 --> 00:05:52.774
(Laughter)

00:05:52.798 --> 00:05:54.519
And the unproductive ones weren't --

00:05:54.543 --> 00:05:57.985
I think you're laughing because
most of you are on that list, aren't you?

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:59.508
(Laughter)

00:05:59.532 --> 00:06:02.145
Lawyers! I think he was right
about the lawyers.

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:05.525
Definitely not the professors,
the letters of all kind people.

00:06:05.549 --> 00:06:09.574
So lawyers, professors,
shopkeepers, musicians.

00:06:09.598 --> 00:06:10.979
He obviously hated the opera.

00:06:11.003 --> 00:06:13.692
He must have seen
the worst performance of his life

00:06:13.716 --> 00:06:15.386
the night before writing this book.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.427
There's at least
three professions up there

00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:18.952
that have to do with the opera.

00:06:18.976 --> 00:06:21.949
But this wasn't an exercise
of saying, "Don't do these things."

00:06:21.973 --> 00:06:23.699
It was just, "What's going to happen

00:06:23.723 --> 00:06:27.321
if we actually end up allowing
some parts of the economy to get too large

00:06:27.345 --> 00:06:30.250
without really thinking about
how to increase the productivity

00:06:30.274 --> 00:06:33.572
of the source of the value
that they thought was key,

00:06:33.596 --> 00:06:35.437
which was industrial labor.

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:38.571
And again, don't ask yourself
is this right or is this wrong,

00:06:38.595 --> 00:06:39.914
it was just very contested.

00:06:39.938 --> 00:06:41.406
By making these lists,

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.799
it actually forced them also
to ask interesting questions.

00:06:44.823 --> 00:06:48.358
And their focus,
as the focus of the Physiocrats,

00:06:48.382 --> 00:06:51.762
was, in fact, on these objective
conditions of production.

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:54.278
They also looked, for example,
at the class struggle.

00:06:54.302 --> 00:06:55.703
Their understanding of wages

00:06:55.727 --> 00:06:59.080
had to do with the objective,
if you want, power relationships,

00:06:59.104 --> 00:07:01.665
the bargaining power of capital and labor.

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:05.624
But again, factories, machines,
division of labor,

00:07:05.648 --> 00:07:07.974
agricultural land
and what was happening to it.

00:07:07.998 --> 00:07:11.046
So the big revolution
that then happened --

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.122
and this, by the way, is not often
taught in economics classes --

00:07:14.146 --> 00:07:17.080
the big revolution that happened
with the current system

00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:18.746
of economic thinking that we have,

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.348
which is called "neoclassical economics,"

00:07:21.372 --> 00:07:23.898
was that the logic completely changed.

00:07:23.922 --> 00:07:25.231
It changed in two ways.

00:07:25.255 --> 00:07:29.684
It changed from this focus on
objective conditions to subjective ones.

00:07:29.708 --> 00:07:31.449
Let me explain what I mean by that.

00:07:31.473 --> 00:07:33.653
Objective, in the way I just said.

00:07:33.677 --> 00:07:36.308
Subjective, in the sense that
all the attention went to

00:07:36.332 --> 00:07:39.487
how individuals of different sorts
make their decisions.

00:07:39.511 --> 00:07:43.868
OK, so workers are maximizing
their choices of leisure versus work.

00:07:43.892 --> 00:07:46.953
Consumers are maximizing
their so-called utility,

00:07:46.977 --> 00:07:48.616
which is a proxy for happiness,

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.669
and firms are maximizing their profits.

00:07:51.693 --> 00:07:54.998
And the idea behind this was that
then we can aggregate this up,

00:07:55.022 --> 00:07:56.641
and we see what that turns into,

00:07:56.665 --> 00:07:59.233
which are these nice, fancy
supply-and-demand curves

00:07:59.257 --> 00:08:01.507
which produce a price,

00:08:01.531 --> 00:08:02.936
an equilibrium price.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.487
It's an equilibrium price,
because we also added to it

00:08:05.511 --> 00:08:07.671
a lot of Newtonian physics equations

00:08:07.695 --> 00:08:11.637
where centers of gravity are very much
part of the organizing principle.

00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:15.441
But the second point here is that
that equilibrium price, or prices,

00:08:15.465 --> 00:08:17.281
reveal value.

00:08:17.305 --> 00:08:20.390
So the revolution here is a change
from objective to subjective,

00:08:20.414 --> 00:08:24.157
but also the logic is no longer
one of what is value,

00:08:24.181 --> 00:08:25.664
how is it being determined,

00:08:25.688 --> 00:08:28.297
what is the reproductive
potential of the economy,

00:08:28.321 --> 00:08:30.360
which then leads to a theory of price

00:08:30.384 --> 00:08:31.583
but rather the reverse:

00:08:31.607 --> 00:08:33.745
a theory of price and exchange

00:08:33.769 --> 00:08:35.099
which reveals value.

00:08:35.123 --> 00:08:37.146
Now, this is a huge change.

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:41.077
And it's not just an academic exercise,
as fascinating as that might be.

00:08:41.101 --> 00:08:43.014
It affects how we measure growth.

00:08:43.038 --> 00:08:46.849
It affects how we steer economies
to produce more of some activities,

00:08:46.873 --> 00:08:48.041
less of others,

00:08:48.065 --> 00:08:50.768
how we also remunerate
some activities more than others.

00:08:50.792 --> 00:08:53.022
And it also just kind of makes you think,

00:08:53.046 --> 00:08:57.032
you know, are you happy to get out of bed
if you're a value creator or not,

00:08:57.056 --> 00:09:00.447
and how is the price system itself
if you aren't determining that?

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.604
I mentioned it affects
how we think about output.

00:09:04.628 --> 00:09:07.356
If we only include, for example, in GDP,

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.107
those activities that have prices,

00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:11.398
all sorts of really weird things happen.

00:09:11.422 --> 00:09:13.724
Feminist economists
and environmental economists

00:09:13.748 --> 00:09:15.871
have actually written
about this quite a bit.

00:09:15.895 --> 00:09:17.362
Let me give you some examples.

00:09:17.386 --> 00:09:22.820
If you marry your babysitter,
GDP will go down, so do not do it.

00:09:22.844 --> 00:09:24.482
Do not be tempted to do this, OK?

00:09:24.506 --> 00:09:28.302
Because an activity that perhaps was
before being paid for is still being done

00:09:28.326 --> 00:09:29.478
but is no longer paid.

00:09:29.502 --> 00:09:30.597
(Laughter)

00:09:30.621 --> 00:09:31.972
If you pollute, GDP goes up.

00:09:31.996 --> 00:09:34.878
Still don't do it, but if you do it,
you'll help the economy.

00:09:34.902 --> 00:09:37.729
Why? Because we have to actually
pay someone to clean it.

00:09:38.464 --> 00:09:41.440
Now, what's also really interesting
is what happened to finance

00:09:41.464 --> 00:09:43.485
in the financial sector in GDP.

00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:46.156
This also, by the way, is something
I'm always surprised

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.717
that many economists don't know.

00:09:47.741 --> 00:09:49.242
Up until 1970,

00:09:49.266 --> 00:09:52.981
most of the financial sector
was not even included in GDP.

00:09:53.005 --> 00:09:55.502
It was kind of indirectly,
perhaps not knowingly,

00:09:55.526 --> 00:09:58.253
still being seen through the eyes
of the Physiocrats

00:09:58.277 --> 00:10:02.334
as just kind of moving stuff around,
not actually producing anything new.

00:10:02.358 --> 00:10:06.398
So only those activities
that had an explicit price were included.

00:10:06.422 --> 00:10:09.579
For example, if you went to get
a mortgage, you were charged a fee.

00:10:09.603 --> 00:10:12.993
That went into GDP and the national
income and product accounting.

00:10:13.017 --> 00:10:15.770
But, for example,
net interest payments didn't,

00:10:15.794 --> 00:10:19.753
the difference between
what banks were earning in interest

00:10:19.777 --> 00:10:23.009
if they gave you a loan and what
they were paying out for a deposit.

00:10:23.033 --> 00:10:24.368
That wasn't being included.

00:10:24.392 --> 00:10:27.601
And so the people doing the accounting
started to look at some data,

00:10:27.625 --> 00:10:30.356
which started to show
that the size of finance

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.862
and these net interest payments

00:10:31.886 --> 00:10:33.686
were actually growing substantially.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.822
And they called this
the "banking problem."

00:10:35.846 --> 00:10:39.034
These were some people working
inside, actually, the United Nations

00:10:39.058 --> 00:10:42.044
in a group called the Systems
of National [Accounts], SNA.

00:10:42.068 --> 00:10:43.857
They called it the "banking problem,"

00:10:43.881 --> 00:10:47.251
like, "Oh my God, this thing is huge,
and we're not even including it."

00:10:47.275 --> 00:10:50.442
So instead of stopping and actually
making that Tableau Economique

00:10:50.466 --> 00:10:52.597
or asking some of these
fundamental questions

00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:55.939
that also the classicals were asking
about what is actually happening,

00:10:55.963 --> 00:10:59.532
the division of labor between different
types of activities in the economy,

00:10:59.556 --> 00:11:02.005
they simply gave these
net interest payments a name.

00:11:02.029 --> 00:11:05.359
So the commercial banks, they called this
"financial intermediation."

00:11:05.383 --> 00:11:07.281
That went into the NIPA accounts.

00:11:07.305 --> 00:11:10.945
And the investment banks
were called the "risk-taking activities,"

00:11:10.969 --> 00:11:12.120
and that went in.

00:11:12.144 --> 00:11:14.149
In case I haven't explained this properly,

00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:16.142
that red line is showing how much quicker

00:11:16.166 --> 00:11:18.935
financial intermediation
as a whole was growing

00:11:18.959 --> 00:11:22.152
compared to the rest of the economy,
the blue line, industry.

00:11:22.679 --> 00:11:24.749
And so this was quite extraordinary,

00:11:24.749 --> 00:11:27.331
because what actually happened,
and what we know today,

00:11:27.331 --> 00:11:29.597
and there's different people
writing about this,

00:11:29.597 --> 00:11:31.768
this data here
is from the Bank of England,

00:11:31.768 --> 00:11:34.052
is that lots of what finance
was actually doing

00:11:34.052 --> 00:11:35.987
from the 1970s and '80s on

00:11:36.194 --> 00:11:38.724
was basically financing itself:

00:11:38.748 --> 00:11:40.601
finance financing finance.

00:11:40.625 --> 00:11:44.156
And what I mean by that is finance,
insurance and real estate.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.783
In fact, in the UK,

00:11:45.807 --> 00:11:48.904
something like between
10 and 20 percent of finance

00:11:48.928 --> 00:11:51.465
finds its way into
the real economy, into industry,

00:11:51.489 --> 00:11:54.157
say, into the energy sector,
into pharmaceuticals,

00:11:54.181 --> 00:11:55.899
into the IT sector,

00:11:55.923 --> 00:12:00.057
but most of it goes back
into that acronym, FIRE:

00:12:00.081 --> 00:12:01.815
finance, insurance and real estate.

00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:04.398
It's very conveniently called FIRE.

00:12:04.422 --> 00:12:07.962
Now, this is interesting because, in fact,

00:12:07.986 --> 00:12:11.025
it's not to say that finance
is good or bad,

00:12:11.049 --> 00:12:12.459
but the degree to which,

00:12:12.483 --> 00:12:14.086
by just having to give it a name,

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.973
because it actually had an income
that was being generated,

00:12:16.997 --> 00:12:20.120
as opposed to pausing and asking,
"What is it actually doing?" --

00:12:20.144 --> 00:12:21.609
that was a missed opportunity.

00:12:21.633 --> 00:12:26.009
Similarly, in the real economy,
in industry itself, what was happening?

00:12:26.501 --> 00:12:33.385
And this real focus on prices
and also share prices

00:12:33.409 --> 00:12:35.929
has created a huge problem
of reinvestment,

00:12:35.953 --> 00:12:39.771
again, this real attention that both
the Physiocrats and the classicals had

00:12:39.795 --> 00:12:43.396
to the degree to which the value
that was being generated in the economy

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.586
was in fact being reinvested back in.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:49.603
And so what we have today is
an ultrafinancialized industrial sector

00:12:49.627 --> 00:12:53.298
where, increasingly, a share
of the profits and the net income

00:12:53.322 --> 00:12:56.182
are not actually going
back into production,

00:12:56.206 --> 00:12:59.805
into human capital training,
into research and development

00:12:59.829 --> 00:13:03.714
but just being siphoned out
in terms of buying back your own shares,

00:13:03.738 --> 00:13:06.518
which boosts stock options,
which is, in fact, the way

00:13:06.542 --> 00:13:08.520
that many executives are getting paid.

00:13:08.544 --> 00:13:11.108
And, you know, some
share buybacks is absolutely fine,

00:13:11.132 --> 00:13:13.169
but this system
is completely out of whack.

00:13:13.193 --> 00:13:15.062
These numbers that I'm showing you here

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:19.283
show that in the last 10 years,
466 of the S and P 500 companies

00:13:19.307 --> 00:13:23.032
have spent over four trillion
on just buying back their shares.

00:13:23.056 --> 00:13:26.871
And what you see then if you aggregate
this up at the macroeconomic level,

00:13:26.895 --> 00:13:29.441
so if we look at aggregate
business investment,

00:13:29.465 --> 00:13:31.452
which is a percentage of GDP,

00:13:31.476 --> 00:13:35.130
you also see this falling level
of business investment.

00:13:35.154 --> 00:13:36.333
And this is a problem.

00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:40.667
This, by the way, is a huge problem
for skills and job creation.

00:13:40.691 --> 00:13:43.397
You might have heard there's lots
of attention these days

00:13:43.421 --> 00:13:45.200
to, "Are the robots taking our jobs?"

00:13:45.224 --> 00:13:48.180
Well, mechanization has
for centuries, actually, taken jobs,

00:13:48.204 --> 00:13:51.530
but as long as profits were being
reinvested back into production,

00:13:51.554 --> 00:13:53.552
then it didn't matter: new jobs appeared.

00:13:53.576 --> 00:13:57.366
But this lack of reinvestment
is, in fact, very dangerous.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:01.532
Similarly, in the pharmaceutical industry,
for example, how prices are set,

00:14:01.556 --> 00:14:04.937
it's quite interesting how it doesn't look
at these objective conditions

00:14:04.961 --> 00:14:09.320
of the collective way in which value
is created in the economy.

00:14:09.344 --> 00:14:12.134
So in the sector where you have
lots of different actors --

00:14:12.158 --> 00:14:15.723
public, private, of course, but also
third-sector organizations --

00:14:15.747 --> 00:14:16.899
creating value,

00:14:16.923 --> 00:14:19.311
the way we actually measure
value in this sector

00:14:19.335 --> 00:14:21.540
is through the price system itself.

00:14:21.564 --> 00:14:23.077
Prices reveal value.

00:14:23.101 --> 00:14:24.432
So when, recently,

00:14:24.456 --> 00:14:28.642
the price of an antibiotic
went up by 400 percent overnight,

00:14:28.666 --> 00:14:30.738
and the CEO was asked,
"How can you do this?

00:14:30.762 --> 00:14:32.560
People actually need that antibiotic.

00:14:32.584 --> 00:14:33.744
That's unfair."

00:14:33.768 --> 00:14:35.825
He said, "Well, we have a moral imperative

00:14:35.849 --> 00:14:38.593
to allow prices to go
what the market will bear,"

00:14:38.617 --> 00:14:41.676
completely dismissing the fact
that in the US, for example,

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:46.012
the National Institutes of Health
spent over 30 billion a year

00:14:46.036 --> 00:14:48.816
on the medical research
that actually leads to these drugs.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.774
So, again, a lack of attention
to those objective conditions

00:14:51.798 --> 00:14:55.044
and just allowing the price system
itself to reveal the value.

00:14:55.068 --> 00:14:57.616
Now, this is not just
an academic exercise,

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.483
as interesting as it may be.

00:14:59.507 --> 00:15:03.328
All this really matters
[for] how we measure output,

00:15:03.352 --> 00:15:04.926
to how we steer the economy,

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:07.065
to whether you feel
that you're productive,

00:15:07.089 --> 00:15:10.431
to which sectors we end up
helping, supporting

00:15:10.455 --> 00:15:13.635
and also making people feel
proud to be part of.

00:15:13.659 --> 00:15:15.554
In fact, going back to that quote,

00:15:15.578 --> 00:15:17.913
it's not surprising that Blankfein
could say that.

00:15:17.913 --> 00:15:18.983
He was right.

00:15:18.983 --> 00:15:21.876
In the way that we actually measure
production, productivity

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.184
and value in the economy,

00:15:23.208 --> 00:15:25.876
of course Goldman Sachs workers
are the most productive.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.547
They are in fact earning the most.

00:15:27.571 --> 00:15:29.999
The price of their labor
is revealing their value.

00:15:30.023 --> 00:15:32.504
But this becomes tautological, of course.

00:15:32.528 --> 00:15:34.942
And so there's a real need to rethink.

00:15:35.609 --> 00:15:37.783
We need to rethink
how we're measuring output,

00:15:37.807 --> 00:15:40.402
and in fact there's some
amazing experiments worldwide.

00:15:40.426 --> 00:15:44.960
In New Zealand, for example, they now have
a gross national happiness indicator.

00:15:44.984 --> 00:15:49.275
In Bhutan, also, they're thinking
about happiness and well-being indicators.

00:15:49.299 --> 00:15:52.564
But the problem is that we can't
just be adding things in.

00:15:52.588 --> 00:15:53.745
We do have to pause,

00:15:53.769 --> 00:15:55.944
and I think this should be
a moment for pause,

00:15:55.968 --> 00:15:58.230
given that we see so little
has actually changed

00:15:58.254 --> 00:15:59.579
since the financial crisis,

00:15:59.603 --> 00:16:03.111
to make sure that
we are not also confusing

00:16:03.135 --> 00:16:05.132
value extraction with value creation,

00:16:05.156 --> 00:16:08.463
so looking at what's included,
not just adding more,

00:16:08.487 --> 00:16:12.354
to make sure that we're not, for example,
confusing rents with profits.

00:16:12.378 --> 00:16:15.356
Rents for the classicals
was about unearned income.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.882
Today, rents, when they're
talked about in economics,

00:16:17.906 --> 00:16:21.112
is just an imperfection
towards a competitive price

00:16:21.136 --> 00:16:24.615
that could be competed away
if you take away some asymmetries.

00:16:25.376 --> 00:16:29.620
Second, we of course can steer
activities into what the classicals called

00:16:29.644 --> 00:16:30.920
the "production boundary."

00:16:30.944 --> 00:16:32.891
This should not be an us-versus-them,

00:16:32.915 --> 00:16:36.001
big, bad finance versus
good, other sectors.

00:16:36.025 --> 00:16:37.437
We could reform finance.

00:16:37.461 --> 00:16:40.527
There was a real lost opportunity
in some ways after the crisis.

00:16:40.551 --> 00:16:43.119
We could have had
the financial transaction tax,

00:16:43.143 --> 00:16:46.629
which would have rewarded
long-termism over short-termism,

00:16:46.653 --> 00:16:48.962
but we didn't decide to do that globally.

00:16:48.986 --> 00:16:50.776
We can. We can change our minds.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.929
We can also set up
new types of institutions.

00:16:52.953 --> 00:16:57.103
There's different types of, for example,
public financial institutions worldwide

00:16:57.127 --> 00:17:00.791
that are actually providing that patient,
long-term, committed finance

00:17:00.815 --> 00:17:04.907
that helps small firms grow, that help
infrastructure and innovation happen.

00:17:04.931 --> 00:17:07.188
But this shouldn't just be about output.

00:17:07.212 --> 00:17:09.487
This shouldn't just be about
the rate of output.

00:17:09.511 --> 00:17:11.277
We should also as a society pause

00:17:11.301 --> 00:17:14.243
and ask: What value are we even creating?

00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:17.998
And I just want to end with the fact
that this week we are celebrating

00:17:18.022 --> 00:17:20.643
the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing.

00:17:20.667 --> 00:17:23.455
This required the public sector,
the private sector,

00:17:23.479 --> 00:17:26.404
to invest and innovate
in all sorts of ways,

00:17:26.428 --> 00:17:28.254
not just around aeronautics.

00:17:28.278 --> 00:17:32.296
It included investment in areas
like nutrition and materials.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.561
There were lots of actual mistakes
that were done along the way.

00:17:35.585 --> 00:17:38.972
In fact, what government did was it used
its full power of procurement,

00:17:38.996 --> 00:17:42.021
for example, to fuel
those bottom-up solutions,

00:17:42.045 --> 00:17:43.672
of which some failed.

00:17:43.696 --> 00:17:46.512
But are failures part of value creation?

00:17:46.536 --> 00:17:47.860
Or are they just mistakes?

00:17:47.884 --> 00:17:51.653
Or how do we actually also
nurture the experimentation,

00:17:51.677 --> 00:17:54.229
the trial and error and error and error?

00:17:54.253 --> 00:17:57.448
Bell Labs, which was
the R and D laboratory of AT and T,

00:17:57.472 --> 00:18:01.199
actually came from an era
where government was quite courageous.

00:18:01.223 --> 00:18:06.079
It actually asked AT and T that
in order to maintain its monopoly status,

00:18:06.103 --> 00:18:09.750
it had to reinvest its profits
back into the real economy,

00:18:09.774 --> 00:18:11.036
innovation

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.738
and innovation beyond telecoms.

00:18:12.762 --> 00:18:15.336
That was the history,
the early history of Bell Labs.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:19.126
So how we can get these new conditions
around reinvestment

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:22.002
to collectively invest
in new types of value

00:18:22.026 --> 00:18:24.934
directed at some of the biggest
challenges of our time,

00:18:24.958 --> 00:18:26.229
like climate change?

00:18:26.253 --> 00:18:28.220
This is a key question.

00:18:28.244 --> 00:18:29.972
But we should also ask ourselves,

00:18:29.996 --> 00:18:33.683
had there been a net
present value calculation

00:18:33.707 --> 00:18:36.427
or a cost-benefit analysis done

00:18:36.451 --> 00:18:40.066
about whether or not to even try
to go to the Moon and back again

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.267
in a generation,

00:18:41.291 --> 00:18:43.779
we probably wouldn't have started.

00:18:43.803 --> 00:18:45.523
So thank God,

00:18:45.547 --> 00:18:47.687
because I'm an economist,
and I can tell you,

00:18:47.711 --> 00:18:49.644
value is not just price.

00:18:50.057 --> 00:18:51.239
Thank you.

00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:53.484
(Applause)
