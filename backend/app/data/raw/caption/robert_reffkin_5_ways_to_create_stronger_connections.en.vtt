00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.903
So when was the last time
that you wrote a handwritten note?

00:00:14.945 --> 00:00:16.296
It's probably been a while.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.070
[The Way We Work]

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:22.713
Technology has changed
the way we communicate.

00:00:22.737 --> 00:00:24.338
We send emails, not letters,

00:00:24.362 --> 00:00:26.088
text messages, not phone calls.

00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:29.004
We order delivery instead of
cooking dinners in our kitchen.

00:00:29.028 --> 00:00:30.713
All in the name of efficiency.

00:00:30.737 --> 00:00:32.004
But here's the point.

00:00:32.028 --> 00:00:34.254
Technology has made it
easier to communicate.

00:00:34.278 --> 00:00:36.504
But it hasn't made it easier to connect

00:00:36.528 --> 00:00:37.796
with other human beings.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.879
I've found that the secret to connecting

00:00:39.903 --> 00:00:42.838
in the high-tech, fast-paced
world that we live in,

00:00:42.862 --> 00:00:46.296
is doing a few small things
the old-fashioned way.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.588
Write a letter.

00:00:47.612 --> 00:00:50.046
I've written thousands
of handwritten notes.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.879
Thanking people for advice,
thanking them for an interview.

00:00:52.903 --> 00:00:56.088
It just puts that extra effort
to show someone that you really care

00:00:56.112 --> 00:00:58.379
and that you're willing
to go above and beyond.

00:00:58.403 --> 00:01:01.713
Some advice for writing a thank-you letter
is to really make it clear

00:01:01.737 --> 00:01:03.546
to the person that you're writing to

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.629
the impact that they
have had on your life.

00:01:05.653 --> 00:01:07.171
Talk about something specific.

00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:09.504
Like "Thank you
for the advice that you gave me.

00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:13.713
It's because of the advice you gave me,
that I am now doing x."

00:01:13.737 --> 00:01:15.671
People are looking to make a difference.

00:01:15.695 --> 00:01:18.713
And so if you can show someone
that they've really had an impact

00:01:18.737 --> 00:01:21.504
on the life that you're living,
the life you're pursuing,

00:01:21.528 --> 00:01:22.921
it could have a huge impact.

00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:24.296
Pick up the phone and dial.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.338
We've hired thousands of employees.

00:01:26.362 --> 00:01:29.046
And I've personally called
every single one of them

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.921
to welcome them to the Compass family.

00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:34.338
I'm able to set the tone
of really what I want the company to be.

00:01:34.362 --> 00:01:36.421
Where, you know,
people go above and beyond

00:01:36.445 --> 00:01:39.713
to make people feel welcomed
and to give people a sense of belonging.

00:01:39.737 --> 00:01:42.296
And sometimes I call people
on their last day of work.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.838
When people leave,
sometimes they're more transparent

00:01:44.862 --> 00:01:47.504
than they ever were when they
were still at the company.

00:01:47.528 --> 00:01:49.754
And so it's a great opportunity
to get feedback

00:01:49.778 --> 00:01:51.504
that is very hard to get otherwise.

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:55.129
Ask interesting and meaningful questions
when you get outside of the office.

00:01:55.153 --> 00:01:56.713
When I'm traveling the country,

00:01:56.737 --> 00:01:59.421
every night I'll have dinner
with people in the company.

00:01:59.445 --> 00:02:02.671
And I like to ask questions like
"What's your underlying motivation?

00:02:02.695 --> 00:02:05.963
What's something that's happened
this week that meant a lot to you?"

00:02:05.987 --> 00:02:07.588
And when you go around the table,

00:02:07.612 --> 00:02:09.921
and people really open up
and are able to engage,

00:02:09.945 --> 00:02:11.504
it sets a different tone.

00:02:11.528 --> 00:02:13.296
When people come back to the office,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.379
they can see each other
and they know each other in a deeper way.

00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:18.046
Answer questions with honesty.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.417
You know how it feels
when you go into an elevator

00:02:20.442 --> 00:02:22.420
and someone says, "How was your weekend?"

00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:26.171
It could've been the best weekend ever,
you could've met the love of your life,

00:02:26.195 --> 00:02:28.148
and you would say, "Good, how was yours?"

00:02:28.173 --> 00:02:31.046
If you want to connect with people,
then you have to open up.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.129
I'm not always that good at it,
and I imagine most people aren't.

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:36.838
But that's why being open
stands out so much,

00:02:36.862 --> 00:02:38.213
because most people aren't.

00:02:38.237 --> 00:02:39.504
Turn the video on.

00:02:39.528 --> 00:02:42.588
I would always recommend
a videoconference over a phone call.

00:02:42.612 --> 00:02:45.546
Because that's when you can see
the real personality come out.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.921
When you're on video,
you're forced to be present.

00:02:47.945 --> 00:02:50.463
It's almost a forcing mechanism
to be in the moment.

00:02:50.487 --> 00:02:51.921
Nobody succeeds alone.

00:02:51.945 --> 00:02:53.254
The more you can take time

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:56.214
to develop genuine,
authentic relationships,

00:02:56.237 --> 00:02:58.921
the more you're going to be able
to realize your dreams.

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:02.963
You're going to be able to take big risks
and know that there's a network of people

00:03:02.987 --> 00:03:05.320
to cheer you on
and to support your efforts.
