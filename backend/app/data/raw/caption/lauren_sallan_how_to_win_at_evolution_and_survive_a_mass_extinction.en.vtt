00:00:13.032 --> 00:00:14.399
Congratulations.

00:00:14.721 --> 00:00:15.921
By being here,

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:17.382
listening, alive,

00:00:17.406 --> 00:00:19.707
a member of a growing species,

00:00:19.731 --> 00:00:22.692
you are one of history's
greatest winners --

00:00:22.716 --> 00:00:27.136
the culmination of a success story
four billion years in the making.

00:00:27.768 --> 00:00:29.899
You are life's one percent.

00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:32.040
The losers,

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:34.896
the 99 percent of species
who have ever lived,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.086
are dead --

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.471
killed by fire, flood, asteroids,

00:00:39.495 --> 00:00:41.796
predation, starvation, ice, heat

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.600
and the cold math of natural selection.

00:00:45.186 --> 00:00:46.386
Your ancestors,

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.960
back to the earliest fishes,

00:00:47.984 --> 00:00:50.075
overcame all these challenges.

00:00:50.932 --> 00:00:53.901
You are here because
of golden opportunities

00:00:53.925 --> 00:00:56.590
made possible by mass extinction.

00:00:57.437 --> 00:01:00.683
(Laughter)

00:01:01.048 --> 00:01:02.199
It's true.

00:01:02.223 --> 00:01:05.452
The same is true
of your co-winners and relatives.

00:01:05.476 --> 00:01:08.165
The 34,000 kinds of fishes.

00:01:08.586 --> 00:01:10.686
How did we all get so lucky?

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.343
Will we continue to win?

00:01:13.278 --> 00:01:17.233
I am a fish paleobiologist
who uses big data --

00:01:17.257 --> 00:01:18.466
the fossil record --

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.720
to study how some species win
and others lose.

00:01:22.088 --> 00:01:23.698
The living can't tell us;

00:01:23.722 --> 00:01:25.422
they know nothing but winning.

00:01:25.446 --> 00:01:27.390
So, we must speak with the dead.

00:01:27.946 --> 00:01:29.668
How do we make dead fishes talk?

00:01:30.265 --> 00:01:34.678
Museums contain multitudes
of beautiful fish fossils,

00:01:34.702 --> 00:01:36.482
but their real beauty emerges

00:01:36.506 --> 00:01:40.753
when combined with the larger
number of ugly, broken fossils,

00:01:40.777 --> 00:01:42.918
and reduced to ones and zeros.

00:01:43.327 --> 00:01:47.723
I can trawl a 500-million-year database
for evolutionary patterns.

00:01:48.412 --> 00:01:49.566
For example,

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.337
fish forms can be captured by coordinates

00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:57.467
and transformed to reveal
major pathways of change

00:01:57.491 --> 00:01:59.610
and trends through time.

00:02:00.583 --> 00:02:02.920
Here is the story
of the winners and losers

00:02:02.944 --> 00:02:07.077
of just one pivotal event
I discovered using fossil data.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.972
Let's travel back 360 million years --

00:02:11.996 --> 00:02:15.536
six times as long ago
as the last dinosaur --

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.206
to the Devonian period;

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.615
a strange world.

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:23.366
Armored predators
with razor-edge jaws dominated

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.513
alongside huge fishes
with arm bones in their fins.

00:02:29.106 --> 00:02:32.359
Crab-like fishes scuttled
across the sea floor.

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:36.761
The few ray-fin relatives
of salmon and tuna

00:02:36.785 --> 00:02:39.269
cowered at the bottom of the food chain.

00:02:40.217 --> 00:02:43.713
The few early sharks
lived offshore in fear.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.652
Your few four-legged ancestors,
the tetrapods,

00:02:48.676 --> 00:02:51.147
struggled in tropical river plains.

00:02:52.391 --> 00:02:54.102
Ecosystems were crowded.

00:02:54.744 --> 00:02:56.599
There was no escape,

00:02:56.623 --> 00:02:58.375
no opportunity in sight.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.496
Then the world ended.

00:03:00.888 --> 00:03:02.838
(Laughter)

00:03:02.862 --> 00:03:04.227
No, it is a good thing.

00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:08.619
96 percent of all fish species died

00:03:08.643 --> 00:03:13.103
during the Hangenberg event,
359 million years ago:

00:03:13.127 --> 00:03:15.135
an interval of fire and ice.

00:03:15.516 --> 00:03:18.511
A crowded world was disrupted
and swept away.

00:03:19.735 --> 00:03:22.236
Now, you might think
that's the end of the story.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.451
The mighty fell,
the meek inherited the earth,

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:25.680
and here we are.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.929
But winning is not that simple.

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:33.333
The handful of survivors
came from many groups --

00:03:33.357 --> 00:03:36.303
all greatly outnumbered by their own dead.

00:03:36.327 --> 00:03:39.060
They ranged from top predator
to bottom-feeder,

00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:40.384
big to small,

00:03:40.408 --> 00:03:42.381
marine to freshwater.

00:03:42.405 --> 00:03:44.397
The extinction was a filter.

00:03:44.421 --> 00:03:46.606
It merely leveled the playing field.

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:52.770
What really counted was what survivors did
over the next several million years

00:03:52.794 --> 00:03:54.575
in that devastated world.

00:03:56.033 --> 00:03:58.803
The former overlords
should have had an advantage.

00:03:59.245 --> 00:04:01.085
They became even larger,

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.503
storing energy,

00:04:02.527 --> 00:04:04.150
investing in their young,

00:04:04.174 --> 00:04:05.836
spreading across the globe,

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.329
feasting on fishes,

00:04:07.353 --> 00:04:10.467
keeping what had always worked,
and biding their time.

00:04:10.906 --> 00:04:13.923
Yet they merely persisted for a while,

00:04:13.947 --> 00:04:15.994
declining without innovating,

00:04:16.018 --> 00:04:18.279
becoming living fossils.

00:04:18.887 --> 00:04:20.848
They were too stuck in their ways

00:04:20.872 --> 00:04:22.780
and are now largely forgotten.

00:04:24.366 --> 00:04:29.525
A few of the long-suffering ray-fins,
sharks and four-legged tetrapods

00:04:29.549 --> 00:04:31.203
went the opposite direction.

00:04:31.528 --> 00:04:33.240
They became smaller --

00:04:33.264 --> 00:04:35.084
living fast,
dying young,

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:37.172
eating little
and reproducing rapidly.

00:04:37.687 --> 00:04:39.654
They tried new foods,

00:04:39.678 --> 00:04:40.883
different homes,

00:04:40.907 --> 00:04:43.258
strange heads
and weird bodies.

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:44.464
(Laughter)

00:04:44.488 --> 00:04:47.448
And they found opportunity, proliferated,

00:04:47.472 --> 00:04:51.427
and won the future
for their 60,000 living species,

00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:52.822
including you.

00:04:52.846 --> 00:04:54.465
That's why they look familiar.

00:04:54.489 --> 00:04:55.927
You know their names.

00:04:57.635 --> 00:05:00.112
Winning is not about random events

00:05:00.136 --> 00:05:01.595
or an arms race.

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:05.881
Rather, survivors went down alternative,
evolutionary pathways.

00:05:06.294 --> 00:05:08.819
Some found incredible success,

00:05:08.843 --> 00:05:11.310
while others became dead fish walking.

00:05:12.572 --> 00:05:14.885
(Laughter)

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:16.516
A real scientific term.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.723
(Laughter)

00:05:18.747 --> 00:05:19.915
I am now investigating

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:23.632
how these pathways to victory and defeat
repeat across time.

00:05:24.075 --> 00:05:28.197
My lab has already compiled thousands
upon thousands of dead fishes,

00:05:28.221 --> 00:05:29.869
but many more remain.

00:05:29.893 --> 00:05:31.750
However, it is already clear

00:05:31.774 --> 00:05:35.454
that your ancestors' survival
through mass extinction,

00:05:35.478 --> 00:05:37.922
and their responses in the aftermath

00:05:37.946 --> 00:05:39.878
made you who you are today.

00:05:40.262 --> 00:05:42.381
What does this tell us for the future?

00:05:42.405 --> 00:05:45.159
As long as a handful of species survive,

00:05:45.183 --> 00:05:47.257
life will recover.

00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:51.154
The versatile and the lucky
will not just replace what was lost,

00:05:51.178 --> 00:05:52.753
but win in new forms.

00:05:53.121 --> 00:05:55.552
It just might take several million years.

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:57.789
Thank you.

00:05:57.813 --> 00:06:02.492
(Applause)
