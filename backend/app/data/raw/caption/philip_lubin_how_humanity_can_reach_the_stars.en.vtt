00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:15.746
We're here at the University
of California, Santa Barbara

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.357
to discuss a dream of humanity:

00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:21.363
the ability to exit our solar system

00:00:21.387 --> 00:00:23.569
and enter another solar system.

00:00:23.593 --> 00:00:27.177
And the solution is literally
before your eyes.

00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:30.383
So I have two things on me
that you have -- I have a watch,

00:00:30.407 --> 00:00:31.813
and I have a flashlight,

00:00:31.837 --> 00:00:34.019
which, if it's not on you,
it's on your phone.

00:00:34.043 --> 00:00:35.926
So the watch keeps time,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.195
and my flashlight
just illuminates my environment.

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.456
So like art, to me,
science is illuminating.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.877
I want to see reality in a different way.

00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:46.410
When I turn on the flashlight,

00:00:46.434 --> 00:00:49.304
suddenly the dark becomes bright,
and I suddenly see.

00:00:49.328 --> 00:00:50.963
The flashlight and its light,

00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:52.464
which you can see coming out --

00:00:52.488 --> 00:00:55.042
the light on my hand
is not only illuminating my hand,

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.768
it's actually pushing on my hand.

00:00:56.792 --> 00:00:59.101
Light carries energy and momentum.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:02.201
So the answer is not to make a spacecraft
out of a flashlight,

00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:04.154
by having the exhaust come out this way

00:01:04.178 --> 00:01:05.845
and the spacecraft goes that way --

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.741
that's what we do today with chemistry.

00:01:07.765 --> 00:01:08.947
The answer is this:

00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:11.515
Take the flashlight and put it
somewhere on the Earth,

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:12.774
in orbit or on the Moon,

00:01:12.798 --> 00:01:14.571
and then shine it on a reflector,

00:01:14.595 --> 00:01:18.903
which propels the reflector to speeds
which can approach the speed of light.

00:01:18.927 --> 00:01:21.411
Well, how do you make a flashlight
that's big enough?

00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:22.752
This isn't going to do it,

00:01:22.776 --> 00:01:24.855
my hand doesn't seem to be going anywhere.

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:27.101
And that's because the force
is very, very low.

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:29.125
So the way that you can solve this problem

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.964
is taking many, many flashlights,
which are actually lasers,

00:01:31.988 --> 00:01:33.472
and synchronizing them in time,

00:01:33.496 --> 00:01:37.100
and when you gang them all together
into a gigantic array,

00:01:37.124 --> 00:01:39.344
which we call a phased array,

00:01:39.368 --> 00:01:42.241
you then have a sufficiently
powerful system,

00:01:42.265 --> 00:01:44.760
which, if you make it roughly
the size of a city,

00:01:44.784 --> 00:01:48.910
it can push a spacecraft,
which is roughly the size of your hand,

00:01:48.934 --> 00:01:53.161
to speeds which are roughly
25 percent the speed of light.

00:01:53.185 --> 00:01:56.979
That would enable us to get
to the nearest star, Proxima Centauri,

00:01:57.003 --> 00:01:59.450
which is a little over
four light years away,

00:01:59.474 --> 00:02:01.474
in less than 20 years.

00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:04.947
Initial probes would be
roughly the size of your hand,

00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:07.577
and the size of the reflector
that you're going to use

00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:09.490
is going to be roughly human size,

00:02:09.514 --> 00:02:11.529
so not a whole lot larger than myself,

00:02:11.553 --> 00:02:13.466
but a few meters in size.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.561
It only uses the reflection of light
from this very large laser array

00:02:19.585 --> 00:02:21.379
to propel the spacecraft.

00:02:21.403 --> 00:02:23.378
So let's talk about this.

00:02:23.402 --> 00:02:26.583
This is a lot like sailing on the ocean.

00:02:26.607 --> 00:02:29.822
When you sail on the ocean,
you're pushed by the wind.

00:02:29.846 --> 00:02:32.679
And the wind then drives the sail
forward through the water.

00:02:32.703 --> 00:02:36.398
In our case, we're creating
an artificial wind in space

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:37.699
from this laser array,

00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:41.049
except the wind is actually the photons
from the laser itself,

00:02:41.073 --> 00:02:44.196
the light from the laser becomes the wind

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.545
upon which we sail.

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.100
It is a very directed light --

00:02:47.124 --> 00:02:49.248
it's often called directed energy.

00:02:49.272 --> 00:02:50.702
So why is this possible today,

00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:53.268
why can we talk about
going to the stars today,

00:02:53.292 --> 00:02:54.971
when 60 years ago,

00:02:54.995 --> 00:02:57.514
when the space program began in earnest,

00:02:57.538 --> 00:02:59.728
people would have said,
"That's not possible"?

00:02:59.752 --> 00:03:04.212
Well, the reason it's possible today
has a lot to do with the consumer,

00:03:04.236 --> 00:03:06.236
and the very fact that you're watching me.

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.855
You're watching me
over a high-speed internet,

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:14.307
which is dominated by the photonics
of sending data over fiber optics.

00:03:14.776 --> 00:03:18.501
Photonics essentially allow
the internet to exist

00:03:18.525 --> 00:03:19.799
in the way it does today.

00:03:19.823 --> 00:03:22.978
The ability to send vast amounts
of data very quickly

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:25.820
is the same technology
that we're going to use

00:03:25.844 --> 00:03:28.958
to send spacecraft
very quickly to the stars.

00:03:28.982 --> 00:03:31.530
You effectively have an infinite
supply of propellent,

00:03:31.554 --> 00:03:33.403
you can turn it on and off as needed.

00:03:33.427 --> 00:03:38.772
You do not leave the laser array
that produces the light on

00:03:38.796 --> 00:03:40.201
for the entire journey.

00:03:40.225 --> 00:03:42.757
For small spacecraft,
it's only on for a few minutes,

00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:46.299
and then it's like shooting a gun.

00:03:46.323 --> 00:03:50.363
You have a projectile
which just moves ballistically.

00:03:50.387 --> 00:03:53.847
Even if we, as humans,
are not on the spacecraft,

00:03:53.871 --> 00:03:56.667
at least we have the ability
to send out such spacecraft.

00:03:57.133 --> 00:03:59.320
You want to remotely view,

00:03:59.344 --> 00:04:02.844
or have remote imaging and remote sensing,

00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:04.264
of an object.

00:04:04.288 --> 00:04:06.887
So when we go to Jupiter, for example,

00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:08.950
with a flyby mission,

00:04:08.974 --> 00:04:10.609
we are taking pictures of Jupiter,

00:04:10.633 --> 00:04:12.316
we're measuring the magnetic field,

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.514
the particle density,

00:04:13.538 --> 00:04:15.529
and we're basically exploring remotely.

00:04:15.553 --> 00:04:17.482
The same way that you are looking at me.

00:04:17.506 --> 00:04:20.823
And all of the current missions
that are beyond the Moon

00:04:20.847 --> 00:04:22.887
are remote-sensing missions.

00:04:22.911 --> 00:04:25.744
What would we hope to find
if we visited an exoplanet?

00:04:25.768 --> 00:04:28.141
Perhaps there's life on an exoplanet,

00:04:28.165 --> 00:04:30.744
and we would be able to see
evidence of life,

00:04:30.768 --> 00:04:33.029
either through atmospheric biosignatures

00:04:33.053 --> 00:04:35.168
or through, you know, a dramatic picture,

00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:37.958
we would be able to see something
actually on the surface.

00:04:37.982 --> 00:04:40.681
We don't know if there's life
elsewhere in the universe.

00:04:40.705 --> 00:04:44.379
Perhaps on the missions that we send out,
we will find evidence for life,

00:04:44.403 --> 00:04:45.855
perhaps we will not.

00:04:46.196 --> 00:04:49.076
And while economics may seem
like an inappropriate thing

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.868
to bring into a talk
on interstellar capability,

00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:57.812
it is in fact one of the driving issues
in achieving interstellar capability.

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.620
You have to get things to the point
where they're economically affordable

00:05:02.644 --> 00:05:03.914
to do what we want to do.

00:05:03.938 --> 00:05:05.359
So currently,

00:05:05.383 --> 00:05:06.909
we have systems in the lab

00:05:06.933 --> 00:05:11.864
which have achieved the ability
to synchronize over very large scales,

00:05:11.888 --> 00:05:15.618
out to about 10 kilometers
or roughly six miles.

00:05:16.367 --> 00:05:19.234
We've been able to achieve
synchronization of laser systems,

00:05:19.258 --> 00:05:20.869
and it's worked beautifully.

00:05:20.893 --> 00:05:25.266
We've known how to build lasers
for many decades,

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.160
but it's only now that the technology
has gotten inexpensive enough,

00:05:29.184 --> 00:05:30.755
and become mature enough

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:35.649
that we can imagine
having huge arrays, literally,

00:05:35.673 --> 00:05:39.299
kilometer-scale arrays,
much like solar farms,

00:05:39.323 --> 00:05:43.685
but instead of receiving light,
they transmit light.

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:49.522
The beauty of this type of technology
is it enables many applications,

00:05:49.546 --> 00:05:52.490
not just relativistic flight
for small spacecraft,

00:05:52.514 --> 00:05:55.172
but enables high-speed spacecraft,

00:05:55.196 --> 00:05:57.601
high-speed flight in our solar system,

00:05:57.625 --> 00:05:59.458
it enables planetary defense,

00:05:59.482 --> 00:06:01.950
it enables space debris removal,

00:06:01.974 --> 00:06:07.617
it enables powering of distant assets
that we may want to send power to,

00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:11.426
such as spacecraft or bases
on the Moon or other places.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.633
It's an extremely versatile technology,

00:06:13.657 --> 00:06:16.315
it's something that humanity
would want to develop

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:19.466
even if they didn't want
to send spacecraft to the stars,

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.076
because that technology
allows so many applications

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.601
that are currently not feasible.

00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:27.267
And therefore, I feel
it's an inevitable technology,

00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:29.355
because we have the ability,

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:32.195
we just need to fine-tune the technology

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:35.426
and in a sense, wait for economics
to catch up with us

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:38.649
so that it becomes cheap enough
to build the large systems.

00:06:38.673 --> 00:06:41.244
The smaller systems are affordable now.

00:06:41.268 --> 00:06:44.704
And we've already started building
prototype systems in our lab.

00:06:45.284 --> 00:06:47.291
So while it's not
going to happen tomorrow,

00:06:47.315 --> 00:06:48.871
we've already begun the process,

00:06:48.895 --> 00:06:50.990
and so far, it's looking good.

00:06:51.014 --> 00:06:54.868
This is both a revolutionary program,

00:06:54.892 --> 00:06:58.177
in terms of being
a transformative technology,

00:06:58.201 --> 00:07:01.137
but it's also an evolutionary program.

00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:04.808
So personally,
I do not expect to be around

00:07:04.832 --> 00:07:08.698
when the first
relativistic flight happens.

00:07:08.722 --> 00:07:12.117
I think that's probably 30-plus years off
before we get to that point,

00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:13.712
and perhaps more.

00:07:13.736 --> 00:07:14.910
But what inspires me

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:18.117
is to look at the ability
to achieve the final goal.

00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:20.649
Even if it does not happen in my lifetime,

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:23.537
it can happen in the lifetime
of the next generation

00:07:23.561 --> 00:07:24.998
or the generation beyond that.

00:07:25.022 --> 00:07:28.099
The consequences are so transformative

00:07:28.123 --> 00:07:31.568
that we literally, in my opinion,
must go down this path,

00:07:31.592 --> 00:07:33.900
and must explore what the limitations are,

00:07:33.924 --> 00:07:36.117
and then how do we overcome
the limitations.

00:07:36.141 --> 00:07:37.895
The search for life on other planets

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:42.100
would be one of humanity's
foremost explorations,

00:07:42.124 --> 00:07:44.225
and if we're able to do so,

00:07:44.249 --> 00:07:46.645
and actually find life on another planet,

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:48.756
it would change humanity forever.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.304
Everything is profound in life.

00:07:50.328 --> 00:07:51.522
If you look deep enough,

00:07:51.546 --> 00:07:56.427
you'll find something incredibly complex
and interesting and beautiful in life.

00:07:57.019 --> 00:07:59.566
And the same is true
with the lowly photon

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.970
that we use to see every day.

00:08:03.352 --> 00:08:08.071
But when we look outside
and we imagine something vastly greater,

00:08:08.095 --> 00:08:11.309
an array of lasers that are synchronized,

00:08:11.333 --> 00:08:15.472
we could imagine things
which are just extraordinary in life.

00:08:15.496 --> 00:08:17.456
And the ability to go to another star

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.107
is one of those
extraordinary capabilities.

00:08:21.317 --> 00:08:26.298
