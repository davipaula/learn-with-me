00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:14.023
I'm Kelli Anderson.

00:00:14.573 --> 00:00:16.686
I work as an artist and designer.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.896
And I like to try to find
the hidden talents of everyday things.

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:22.834
So before I get started,

00:00:22.858 --> 00:00:26.830
I want to show you a fast smattering
of some examples of what I do.

00:00:27.877 --> 00:00:30.495
But this talk today
is really less about what I make

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.927
and is more about why I make these things.

00:00:34.172 --> 00:00:37.674
So, I get to tinker
with everyday experiences.

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:40.660
As we go through our everyday lives,

00:00:40.684 --> 00:00:44.745
visual and experiential things
exert this invisible authority

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.170
over our brains at all times.

00:00:47.194 --> 00:00:49.766
And they yield this power
in subtle and sneaky ways.

00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:54.999
So visuals, for example, speak volumes
through these teeny, tiny details,

00:00:55.023 --> 00:00:57.495
codified in things like type,

00:00:59.188 --> 00:01:00.460
shape,

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.619
color

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:05.116
and texture.

00:01:05.513 --> 00:01:09.890
So these small, picky things
form the vocabulary

00:01:09.914 --> 00:01:11.987
that come together and make the sentences,

00:01:13.091 --> 00:01:15.711
enabling us to make
tangible things like ...

00:01:17.227 --> 00:01:18.940
a solar-powered Popsicle truck.

00:01:18.964 --> 00:01:20.011
(Laughter)

00:01:20.035 --> 00:01:22.375
It educates the public
about renewable energy.

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.260
It's basically a physical
infographic on wheels.

00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:29.800
And this unexpected pairing
of sugar, bright colors

00:01:29.824 --> 00:01:33.282
and the threat of humanity's
self-inflicted demise

00:01:33.306 --> 00:01:36.325
actually makes for a pretty
convincing argument for solar.

00:01:38.562 --> 00:01:42.102
People arrive at experiences
like these with expectations.

00:01:42.553 --> 00:01:43.715
And when we make things,

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:47.262
we're actively choosing
what to do with those expectations.

00:01:48.355 --> 00:01:51.835
In my work, I want to create
disruptive wonder.

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.502
I want to confound these expectations,

00:01:54.526 --> 00:01:56.734
because I think that every day,

00:01:56.758 --> 00:02:00.561
fundamental things
and experiences frame reality

00:02:00.585 --> 00:02:02.637
in a way that we often take for granted.

00:02:03.304 --> 00:02:05.330
The small things we make

00:02:05.354 --> 00:02:08.706
can work to reinforce
our assumptions about the world.

00:02:09.964 --> 00:02:13.162
Or small things can come out of left field

00:02:13.186 --> 00:02:17.179
and draw us into reassessing
our complacent expectations about reality.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.419
This doesn't happen often,
but when it does, it's awesome.

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.609
Because then, these small things act
as sort of a humble back door

00:02:25.633 --> 00:02:29.110
into understanding a reality
that's infinitely surprising.

00:02:31.383 --> 00:02:33.057
So, as a little demonstration,

00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:36.119
back to the most basic
and fundamental part of myself again:

00:02:36.143 --> 00:02:39.697
my name, kellianderson.com,
spelled out in block letters.

00:02:40.207 --> 00:02:42.150
This is how people find me in the world.

00:02:42.174 --> 00:02:43.346
It means me.

00:02:44.068 --> 00:02:45.793
But in a more objective sense,

00:02:45.817 --> 00:02:48.000
it's really just this random
jumble of letters

00:02:48.024 --> 00:02:51.320
that I've confined to
the single possibility of making my name.

00:02:51.918 --> 00:02:54.931
So naturally, I wondered:
What else can these letters spell?

00:02:54.955 --> 00:02:59.228
Turns out, all kinds
of interesting phrases, like ...

00:03:01.732 --> 00:03:04.465
"Ken doll is near dot com."

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:05.994
(Laughter)

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.639
A little bit creepy.

00:03:10.474 --> 00:03:12.607
And "A colder melon skin."

00:03:13.503 --> 00:03:14.657
Period.

00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:15.795
(Laughter)

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.231
Far better use of those
kellianderson.com letters,

00:03:18.255 --> 00:03:19.878
I'm sure you'll agree.

00:03:21.545 --> 00:03:25.650
This is a dumb game,
but it underscores a belief I have,

00:03:25.674 --> 00:03:27.361
that the world is full of order

00:03:27.385 --> 00:03:30.180
that doesn't necessarily
deserve our respect.

00:03:30.204 --> 00:03:34.557
Sometimes, there's meaning, justice
and logic present in the way things are.

00:03:35.163 --> 00:03:36.905
But sometimes there just isn't.

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.775
I think that the moment we realize this
is the moment we become creative people,

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.563
because it prompts us to mess things up

00:03:44.587 --> 00:03:47.751
and do something better
with the basic pieces of experience.

00:03:49.823 --> 00:03:53.432
What I'm after in my work,
really, is this:

00:03:53.456 --> 00:03:55.746
the hidden talents of everyday things --

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:59.742
all of those overlooked powers
bestowed on the things that surround us

00:03:59.766 --> 00:04:04.336
by the wonders of physics,
the complexities of cultural associations

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.740
and a gazillion other
only partially chartable things.

00:04:08.563 --> 00:04:10.781
So today, I want to show you
three projects

00:04:10.805 --> 00:04:15.267
that reconsider the vast properties
of commonplace experience

00:04:15.291 --> 00:04:19.462
and try to do something better
by doing something more absurd.

00:04:20.864 --> 00:04:24.402
This first project is a holiday card
I made for my friends.

00:04:24.426 --> 00:04:26.911
My goal in this was
to get people to notice

00:04:26.935 --> 00:04:31.181
this going-through-the-motions holiday
thing that I'm sure we've all felt before.

00:04:31.624 --> 00:04:34.088
And I did that through a holiday card,

00:04:34.112 --> 00:04:35.607
of course.

00:04:35.631 --> 00:04:37.808
From the outside, it looks pretty normal.

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:41.479
But paper has this memory;

00:04:41.503 --> 00:04:43.657
paper never forgets how it was bent.

00:04:43.681 --> 00:04:45.649
I was able to use that material memory

00:04:45.673 --> 00:04:48.489
to guide the recipient
through the experience of the card.

00:04:48.513 --> 00:04:50.139
So when you first pick it up,

00:04:50.163 --> 00:04:53.827
while floppy, it's clear it wants
to bend in all of these certain ways.

00:04:53.851 --> 00:04:55.546
As people tinker with it,

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.500
they discover that bending the card
brings them through this simple story.

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.864
And as you can see,
it's a story about itself.

00:05:03.888 --> 00:05:07.023
(Laughter)

00:05:07.047 --> 00:05:10.836
This card is literally
a four-frame documentary

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.691
about receiving the card.

00:05:12.715 --> 00:05:15.272
(Laughter)

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:18.611
So it's a recursive experience.

00:05:18.635 --> 00:05:20.006
(Applause)

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.790
Oh, well, thank you.

00:05:24.252 --> 00:05:27.742
This excites me, because it's a recursive
experience of a holiday card

00:05:27.766 --> 00:05:30.178
that gets the viewer to feel
this repetitive ritual

00:05:30.202 --> 00:05:31.572
of all holiday cards.

00:05:32.503 --> 00:05:34.872
And it begins life
as a humble piece of paper

00:05:34.896 --> 00:05:36.680
that came out of my inkjet printer.

00:05:37.412 --> 00:05:39.069
I think that's pretty cool.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.359
In a sense, that project was all about
ritual becoming empty gesture.

00:05:46.383 --> 00:05:50.575
And it speaks to the fact that the more
an experience repeats itself,

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:51.784
the less it means --

00:05:51.808 --> 00:05:52.856
(Laughter)

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.508
because we begin to take it for granted.

00:05:55.532 --> 00:05:57.573
And that's why cliches aren't interesting,

00:05:57.597 --> 00:05:59.954
and why people get in
car wrecks near their homes.

00:05:59.978 --> 00:06:02.169
When we experience things
over and over again,

00:06:02.193 --> 00:06:03.827
they just lose their gravity.

00:06:05.207 --> 00:06:06.458
So while paper does have

00:06:06.482 --> 00:06:09.715
all of these astonishing,
overlooked capabilities,

00:06:10.534 --> 00:06:14.442
it takes a hell of a lot of intervention
into getting us to see it as new again.

00:06:15.313 --> 00:06:18.802
This next project I want to show you
is a wedding invitation,

00:06:18.826 --> 00:06:21.977
which is a format
practically begging for reinvention.

00:06:22.001 --> 00:06:23.703
(Laughter)

00:06:23.727 --> 00:06:26.246
This is a card I made
for my friends Mike and Karen,

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.397
who happen to be really awesome people.

00:06:29.118 --> 00:06:32.281
Far more awesome, in fact,
than the format of wedding invitations.

00:06:32.305 --> 00:06:35.636
So it was a really good excuse
to push the boundaries of this format.

00:06:36.783 --> 00:06:38.268
And as far as how to push it,

00:06:38.292 --> 00:06:40.638
the facts of our shared
history made it clear

00:06:40.662 --> 00:06:42.653
that this card should be about music.

00:06:42.677 --> 00:06:44.684
We're all total music nerds,

00:06:44.708 --> 00:06:47.374
and Karen and Mike
have even recorded songs together.

00:06:48.128 --> 00:06:52.234
But you know, you also find inspiration
in the darnedest of places.

00:06:52.766 --> 00:06:56.472
And we found some
with this guy, Mr. Wizard --

00:06:56.496 --> 00:06:57.672
(Laughter)

00:06:57.696 --> 00:06:59.322
who had a much-beloved TV show,

00:06:59.346 --> 00:07:02.269
teaching kids about the science
behind everyday things.

00:07:02.293 --> 00:07:06.068
And I remembered this episode
that demonstrated sound is physical,

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:07.681
with this simple experiment.

00:07:08.408 --> 00:07:10.848
He rolled up a cone of paper,
he taped it shut,

00:07:10.872 --> 00:07:15.968
he taped a needle to the end of it,
and -- voilÃ ! -- it was a record player.

00:07:16.554 --> 00:07:20.683
I remember seeing this as a kid,
and it totally blew my mind.

00:07:21.368 --> 00:07:23.988
If you can make a record player
out of a piece of paper

00:07:24.012 --> 00:07:25.168
and a sewing needle,

00:07:25.192 --> 00:07:27.269
what isn't possible out of the world?

00:07:28.058 --> 00:07:30.410
So I explained this idea
to Mike and Karen,

00:07:30.434 --> 00:07:32.610
and we all decided
that it would be way better

00:07:32.634 --> 00:07:34.777
to make their guests paper record players,

00:07:34.801 --> 00:07:36.858
rather than traditional,
boring invitations.

00:07:36.882 --> 00:07:39.330
We started getting really, really excited.

00:07:39.354 --> 00:07:41.260
And I started getting really nervous,

00:07:41.284 --> 00:07:43.863
because I'm the one
who had to actually make it work.

00:07:43.887 --> 00:07:47.782
So I began spending an inordinate amount
of time thinking about needles:

00:07:47.806 --> 00:07:50.445
Like, would we find needles
with the right fidelity?

00:07:51.047 --> 00:07:52.698
I started calling paper suppliers,

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:55.214
looking for the paper
with the best audio properties.

00:07:55.238 --> 00:07:56.427
(Laughter)

00:07:56.451 --> 00:07:58.107
And they thought I was crazy.

00:08:00.504 --> 00:08:02.869
Meanwhile, Mike and Karen
were recording a song,

00:08:02.893 --> 00:08:05.257
which they had mastered
to a clear flexi disc.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.398
I had this black-and-white
character printed on it,

00:08:08.422 --> 00:08:10.281
so that way, when the disc is turned,

00:08:10.305 --> 00:08:13.239
it completes the couple
in all of these different guises.

00:08:13.263 --> 00:08:15.043
(Laughter)

00:08:16.356 --> 00:08:17.902
So we did it, we really did it!

00:08:17.926 --> 00:08:19.736
We made a paper record player --

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.052
200 recipient-operated
paper record players.

00:08:23.076 --> 00:08:26.011
This is an actual recording
of how it sounds.

00:08:26.035 --> 00:08:29.335
And then it segues into
the real song for comparison.

00:08:32.446 --> 00:08:34.125
(Music and singing)

00:08:55.873 --> 00:08:57.371
(Music ends)

00:08:58.785 --> 00:09:01.297
We were so excited
when we finally got that to work.

00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:02.866
(Laughter)

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.338
And I was excited that we uncovered
this hidden talent of paper

00:09:06.362 --> 00:09:07.641
in the process.

00:09:09.405 --> 00:09:13.324
I also love that project
because it brings attention to the fact

00:09:13.348 --> 00:09:16.092
that we approach media
with all these expectations

00:09:16.116 --> 00:09:18.278
that we do not necessarily need.

00:09:19.313 --> 00:09:22.017
We have assumptions
about material experience,

00:09:22.041 --> 00:09:25.335
like that paper should be silent
or that websites should be flat.

00:09:26.191 --> 00:09:28.096
But we also have these assumptions --

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.374
(Laughter)

00:09:29.398 --> 00:09:32.134
that should be a lot scarier
in a democracy,

00:09:32.158 --> 00:09:34.677
because they're like
these little thought loopholes.

00:09:34.701 --> 00:09:37.809
We sleepwalk through our assumptions
about the authority in media

00:09:37.833 --> 00:09:42.822
and assumptions put forth about political
realities by media, like newspapers.

00:09:43.427 --> 00:09:47.733
But I, for one, have faith
in these small, hacked experiences

00:09:47.757 --> 00:09:49.925
to inspire a sense of skepticism

00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:52.542
at this limited reality we've been handed.

00:09:53.026 --> 00:09:55.973
And this next project
demonstrates just that.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.999
Imagine your normal, everyday
commuter-newspaper-reading ritual.

00:10:01.852 --> 00:10:07.115
But what if you are handed a paper filled
with stories from an alternate reality?

00:10:07.139 --> 00:10:09.177
(Laughter)

00:10:09.201 --> 00:10:13.893
Specifically: What if some crazy person
had meticulously recreated a typical paper

00:10:13.917 --> 00:10:16.383
depicting an alternate reality?

00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:21.543
This is something we actually did do
in the fall of 2008,

00:10:21.567 --> 00:10:24.426
in a project that was conceptualized
by artist Steve Lambert,

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:25.825
organized by The Yes Men

00:10:25.849 --> 00:10:29.904
and executed by many, many people,
some of whom are me.

00:10:30.511 --> 00:10:33.653
We made a perfectly counterfeited
"New York Times."

00:10:34.288 --> 00:10:36.846
We didn't ask anyone
for permission, we just did it.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:37.914
(Laughter)

00:10:37.938 --> 00:10:39.159
We had it mass-produced,

00:10:39.183 --> 00:10:42.285
and we put it in the hands of hundreds
of thousands of commuters

00:10:42.309 --> 00:10:44.481
on a Thursday morning in New York City.

00:10:44.505 --> 00:10:45.716
(Laughter)

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.468
(Applause and cheers)

00:10:48.492 --> 00:10:49.643
Thanks!

00:10:49.667 --> 00:10:51.178
(Applause)

00:10:53.573 --> 00:10:55.017
"Why?," you might ask.

00:10:55.041 --> 00:10:57.557
"Why make a fake newspaper?"

00:11:00.079 --> 00:11:03.356
Well, quite frankly, because the real
newspaper is depressing.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.215
We ostensibly live in a democracy

00:11:05.239 --> 00:11:08.041
where we should have some say
in what happens in the world.

00:11:08.065 --> 00:11:11.640
But the truth is, we never see the stories
we want to see in the newspaper.

00:11:12.198 --> 00:11:14.701
So we made a paper with only good news.

00:11:14.725 --> 00:11:15.756
(Laughter)

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.383
We put in all the policy ideas
we thought would actually help the world.

00:11:19.407 --> 00:11:22.534
Years before the withdrawal
was even discussed,

00:11:22.558 --> 00:11:24.566
we ended the war in Iraq.

00:11:25.226 --> 00:11:26.978
Years before Occupy Wall Street,

00:11:27.002 --> 00:11:29.009
we put in a maximum wage law --

00:11:29.033 --> 00:11:30.345
(Laughter)

00:11:31.682 --> 00:11:33.606
to end the ginormous wage inequities

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.801
between the lowest and highest
income earners.

00:11:37.525 --> 00:11:40.465
We returned civics class
to high school curriculum.

00:11:40.489 --> 00:11:42.262
(Laughter)

00:11:42.286 --> 00:11:43.696
See? These are good ideas!

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.714
So then students would know
how their government works again.

00:11:48.744 --> 00:11:52.065
There's a very important difference
between these two papers.

00:11:52.089 --> 00:11:53.891
(Laughter)

00:11:53.915 --> 00:11:57.153
While the real "New York Times"
has this slogan of,

00:11:57.177 --> 00:11:59.378
"All the News that's Fit to Print,"

00:11:59.402 --> 00:12:01.766
we offered a more
forward-thinking message of,

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:03.924
"All the News We Hope to Print."

00:12:03.948 --> 00:12:05.162
(Laughter)

00:12:05.186 --> 00:12:08.521
And that's because our paper is postdated
six months into the future,

00:12:08.545 --> 00:12:10.715
so when people are handed
these on the street,

00:12:10.739 --> 00:12:14.518
they were literally getting an artifact
from the utopian future,

00:12:14.542 --> 00:12:17.083
sort of a blueprint
for an attainably utopian future

00:12:17.107 --> 00:12:20.505
brought about by this very important idea
of popular pressure.

00:12:21.931 --> 00:12:23.956
And our hoax worked perfectly.

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.334
We suspended people
in this strange mental space,

00:12:26.358 --> 00:12:29.094
because while the stories
in the paper couldn't be real,

00:12:29.118 --> 00:12:32.141
it just felt so perfectly,
impeccably real.

00:12:32.165 --> 00:12:34.184
Here's a video showing --

00:12:34.208 --> 00:12:36.406
(Laughter)

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.230
yes, we did that! --

00:12:38.254 --> 00:12:40.685
showing the first few seconds
of conflicted belief,

00:12:40.709 --> 00:12:42.856
where people could feel
for a moment what --

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.329
(Laughter)

00:12:51.996 --> 00:12:53.215
Yes!

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.960
(Laughter)

00:13:01.866 --> 00:13:03.233
This guy's good.

00:13:05.439 --> 00:13:07.439
(Laughter)

00:13:09.453 --> 00:13:12.566
But in order to get this type of reaction,

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:16.428
our paper had to be radically believable.

00:13:16.452 --> 00:13:20.737
And Daniel Dunnam, my other half, and I
formed the believability team.

00:13:21.728 --> 00:13:23.597
He made sure that the typography,

00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:25.951
the layout, the smell
of the ink -- everything --

00:13:25.975 --> 00:13:27.815
was just like a real "New York Times."

00:13:27.839 --> 00:13:32.802
And I supplied fake advertisements
from the utopian future.

00:13:32.826 --> 00:13:34.397
(Laughter)

00:13:34.421 --> 00:13:37.221
We decided that the utopian future
would be a perfect venue

00:13:37.245 --> 00:13:39.799
to help these companies
who had done wrong in the past

00:13:39.823 --> 00:13:41.699
try making amends for that wrongdoing.

00:13:41.723 --> 00:13:43.208
(Laughter)

00:13:43.232 --> 00:13:46.746
And we do this through the vocabulary
of their own advertising.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.981
So for Ikea, what if
instead of cheap furniture,

00:13:51.005 --> 00:13:52.785
you could buy your own wind farm?

00:13:52.809 --> 00:13:56.748
It comes flat-packed,
clearly easy to assemble --

00:13:56.772 --> 00:13:59.781
(Laughter)

00:13:59.805 --> 00:14:02.124
with that little zigzag tool
and the wooden pegs.

00:14:02.148 --> 00:14:03.720
That would be awesome, right?

00:14:05.068 --> 00:14:07.106
More nefarious are companies
like De Beers,

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.711
who are making amends
for their sale of blood diamonds

00:14:09.735 --> 00:14:12.378
by donating prosthetics
to war-torn African countries.

00:14:14.726 --> 00:14:17.031
And this is our take
on a used car dealership ad.

00:14:17.055 --> 00:14:19.545
They're now offering
a "cash for polluters" program.

00:14:19.569 --> 00:14:21.587
So now you can trade in your car

00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:25.153
for a non-polluting
type of transportation:

00:14:25.177 --> 00:14:26.502
a bicycle!

00:14:26.526 --> 00:14:28.374
(Laughter)

00:14:28.398 --> 00:14:30.707
And here's my favorite, Dr. Zizmor,

00:14:30.731 --> 00:14:33.896
who is giving you
a beautiful, clear conscience.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.619
If you haven't taken a ride
on the New York City subway,

00:14:36.643 --> 00:14:38.149
you may not know Dr. Z.

00:14:38.173 --> 00:14:40.020
But if you have, then you do,

00:14:40.044 --> 00:14:43.467
because his cheesy rainbow ads
are everywhere.

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:46.550
But now he is foregoing
these superficial services.

00:14:46.574 --> 00:14:48.817
He's no longer cleaning up your face,

00:14:48.841 --> 00:14:50.906
now he's cleaning up our mess in Iraq.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.409
(Laughter)

00:14:53.567 --> 00:14:58.154
So the news of our fake paper
made it onto the real news

00:14:58.178 --> 00:14:59.530
all around the world.

00:14:59.554 --> 00:15:02.563
These unexpected messages of hope
were able to get out there

00:15:02.587 --> 00:15:06.623
through our sheer brazenness
in ripping off the "New York Times,"

00:15:06.647 --> 00:15:11.220
but also because we leveraged this pathway
that no one had expected.

00:15:11.244 --> 00:15:14.902
We pushed our paper beyond
its expected role in reporting the news,

00:15:14.926 --> 00:15:17.348
and we made a blueprint
for a better world.

00:15:19.746 --> 00:15:24.067
With those three projects, I demonstrate
that by rejecting normal order,

00:15:24.091 --> 00:15:26.946
by messing things up
and by rearranging the pieces,

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.789
we can expand our notion
of what we demand from reality.

00:15:31.428 --> 00:15:35.277
So today, I want to put forth this idea
that an avenue to better

00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:37.572
is through a million teeny,
tiny disruptions

00:15:37.596 --> 00:15:39.873
to whatever is sitting in front of you.

00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:42.719
So go mess with the complacently rational.

00:15:42.743 --> 00:15:44.745
And you can see more of my work at:

00:15:46.153 --> 00:15:48.218
I'll snore naked dot com.

00:15:48.242 --> 00:15:49.580
(Laughter)

00:15:49.604 --> 00:15:50.879
Thank you.

00:15:50.903 --> 00:15:52.390
(Applause)
