00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.326
My name is Olafur Eliasson.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.794
I'm an artist.

00:00:15.818 --> 00:00:18.688
I work with natural phenomena,

00:00:18.712 --> 00:00:20.697
the weather,

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:23.736
climate, environment

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.860
and our future, one could say.

00:00:25.884 --> 00:00:27.496
(Soft sound)

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.746
I was very inspired by youth movements,

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.563
how young people actually
have organized themselves

00:00:32.587 --> 00:00:34.337
in order to be heard.

00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:36.589
For some time now,

00:00:36.613 --> 00:00:39.466
I have in fact collaborated
with young people --

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.276
they are the artists
as well, in this case --

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.606
to make a project "Earth Speakr,"

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.686
where we, the grown-ups,
can listen to them.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.626
So join me in listening to them
talking about the environment,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.609
and about the climate, about the future,

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:56.217
and see what they have to say.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.823
Girl 1: With "Earth Speakr," I can share
my voice to anything I see.

00:01:01.847 --> 00:01:06.158
It's a platform for us to speak up
and for the world to hear us.

00:01:06.182 --> 00:01:10.113
I could put a face on anything around me
and say my message.

00:01:11.546 --> 00:01:14.779
Hey, excuse me, I can see you.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.244
(Recorded voice)
Hey, excuse me. I can see you.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.466
Kids can be the experts.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.156
When we come together,
we can find the answers.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.373
All you have to do is listen.

00:01:26.284 --> 00:01:28.402
Boy 1: Fight for our future.

00:01:28.871 --> 00:01:33.863
(Italian) Help me to live
1,000 years more.

00:01:34.688 --> 00:01:36.657
(German) I am hungry!

00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:39.330
Boy 2: It's our future,
and it's getting hotter.

00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:42.751
(Recorded voice) It's our
future, and it's getting hotter.

00:01:42.775 --> 00:01:46.375
If I see a message I like,
I can share it with my friends and family.

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.549
Girl 2: It's so cool because
we can share our voices,

00:01:49.573 --> 00:01:50.731
we can hear others,

00:01:50.755 --> 00:01:53.876
and that's how we know
that we're not alone in this fight.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.166
And if enough of us make messages,

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.782
then the grown-ups
will have to listen to us.

00:01:58.806 --> 00:02:01.556
Then we can really make
a change in the world.

00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:05.330
(Polish) I was so dry
before I got watered!

00:02:05.854 --> 00:02:12.848
(Portuguese) Hello! My message would be
that all houses should have solar panels!

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.228
(French) Hey, I am Willy from the Earth!

00:02:17.973 --> 00:02:20.456
Girl 3: Imagine every place
being as green as me.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.246
This can be your future.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.798
OE: See?

00:02:24.401 --> 00:02:26.894
Their imagination
is just so inspiring, I think,

00:02:26.918 --> 00:02:30.123
and gives me hope also,
frankly speaking.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.596
So in "Earth Speakr," only kids can speak,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.398
and the grown-ups are listening, right?

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:39.856
Of course, I still have an ask for you,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.966
as a grown-up, go and make
a Speakr message with a kid

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.546
and send it out into the world.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.409
Make sure that the kid feels
"Wow! Somebody's listening to me."

00:02:50.433 --> 00:02:52.046
Because if we do that,

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.566
I think the future might be
shaping in the right direction.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.615
Thank you.
