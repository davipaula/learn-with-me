00:00:16.028 --> 00:00:17.657
Think about your day for a second.

00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:20.928
You woke up, felt fresh air on your face
as you walked out the door,

00:00:20.952 --> 00:00:23.403
encountered new colleagues
and had great discussions

00:00:23.427 --> 00:00:25.529
and felt in awe
when you found something new.

00:00:25.553 --> 00:00:28.231
But I bet there's something
you didn't think about today,

00:00:28.255 --> 00:00:29.551
something so close to home,

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:32.014
you probably don't think
about it very often at all.

00:00:32.038 --> 00:00:35.301
And that's that all those sensations,
feelings, decisions and actions

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:37.283
are mediated by the computer in your head

00:00:37.307 --> 00:00:38.497
called your brain.

00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:41.206
Now, the brain may not look
like much from the outside --

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.597
a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh,

00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:44.835
amorphous.

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.554
But the last 100 years of neuroscience
have allowed us to zoom in on the brain

00:00:48.578 --> 00:00:50.690
and to see the intricacy
of what lies within.

00:00:50.714 --> 00:00:54.478
And they've told us that this brain
is an incredibly complicated circuit

00:00:54.502 --> 00:00:58.137
made out of hundreds of billions
of cells called neurons.

00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:01.417
Now, unlike a human-designed computer,

00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:04.078
where there's a fairly small number
of different parts,

00:01:04.102 --> 00:01:06.955
and we know how they work
because we humans designed them,

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.050
the brain is made out of thousands
of different kinds of cells,

00:01:10.074 --> 00:01:11.236
maybe tens of thousands.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.605
They come in different shapes;
they're made out of different molecules;

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:17.091
they project and connect
to different brain regions.

00:01:17.115 --> 00:01:20.113
They also change in different ways
in different disease states.

00:01:20.137 --> 00:01:21.513
Let's make it concrete.

00:01:21.537 --> 00:01:23.022
There's a class of cells,

00:01:23.046 --> 00:01:27.102
a fairly small cell, an inhibitory cell,
that quiets its neighbors.

00:01:27.126 --> 00:01:29.386
It's one of the cells
that seems to be atrophied

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.945
in disorders like schizophrenia.

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.670
It's called the basket cell.

00:01:32.694 --> 00:01:35.228
And this cell is one
of the thousands of kinds of cell

00:01:35.252 --> 00:01:36.531
that we're learning about.

00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:38.531
New ones are being discovered every day.

00:01:39.482 --> 00:01:40.876
As just a second example:

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.882
these pyramidal cells, large cells,
can span a significant fraction

00:01:44.906 --> 00:01:46.057
of the brain.

00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:47.263
They're excitatory.

00:01:47.287 --> 00:01:50.000
And these are some of the cells
that might be overactive

00:01:50.024 --> 00:01:51.589
in disorders such as epilepsy.

00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:56.236
Every one of these cells
is an incredible electrical device.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.397
They receive inputs
from thousands of upstream partners

00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:01.773
and compute their own electrical outputs,

00:02:01.797 --> 00:02:04.008
which then, if they pass
a certain threshold,

00:02:04.032 --> 00:02:06.117
will go to thousands
of downstream partners.

00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:08.881
And this process, which takes
just a millisecond or so,

00:02:08.905 --> 00:02:12.898
happens thousands of times a minute
in every one of your 100 billion cells,

00:02:12.922 --> 00:02:15.721
as long as you live and think and feel.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.078
So how are we going to figure out
what this circuit does?

00:02:21.102 --> 00:02:23.093
Ideally, we could go through this circuit

00:02:23.117 --> 00:02:25.659
and turn these different
kinds of cell on and off

00:02:25.683 --> 00:02:27.377
and see whether we could figure out

00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:29.654
which ones contribute to certain functions

00:02:29.678 --> 00:02:32.183
and which ones go wrong
in certain pathologies.

00:02:32.207 --> 00:02:35.515
If we could activate cells, we could see
what powers they can unleash,

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:37.229
what they can initiate and sustain.

00:02:37.253 --> 00:02:38.506
If we could turn them off,

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.372
then we could try and figure out
what they're necessary for.

00:02:41.396 --> 00:02:44.385
And that's the story
I'm going to tell you about today.

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.318
And honestly, where we've gone
through over the last 11 years,

00:02:47.342 --> 00:02:48.828
through an attempt to find ways

00:02:48.852 --> 00:02:51.914
of turning circuits and cells
and parts and pathways of the brain

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:53.089
on and off,

00:02:53.113 --> 00:02:54.696
both to understand the science

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.887
and also to confront some of the issues
that face us all as humans.

00:03:00.675 --> 00:03:03.059
Now, before I tell you
about the technology,

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:07.208
the bad news is that a significant
fraction of us in this room,

00:03:07.232 --> 00:03:08.388
if we live long enough,

00:03:08.412 --> 00:03:10.480
will encounter, perhaps, a brain disorder.

00:03:11.158 --> 00:03:14.976
Already, a billion people
have had some kind of brain disorder

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.422
that incapacitates them.

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:18.841
The numbers don't do it justice, though.

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:21.189
These disorders --
schizophrenia, Alzheimer's,

00:03:21.213 --> 00:03:22.364
depression, addiction --

00:03:22.388 --> 00:03:24.559
they not only steal away our time to live,

00:03:24.583 --> 00:03:25.734
they change who we are.

00:03:25.758 --> 00:03:27.904
They take our identity
and change our emotions

00:03:27.928 --> 00:03:29.948
and change who we are as people.

00:03:30.714 --> 00:03:33.081
Now, in the 20th century,

00:03:34.376 --> 00:03:36.634
there was some hope that was generated

00:03:36.658 --> 00:03:40.271
through the development of pharmaceuticals
for treating brain disorders.

00:03:40.295 --> 00:03:42.532
And while many drugs have been developed

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:45.145
that can alleviate symptoms
of brain disorders,

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.759
practically none of them
can be considered to be cured.

00:03:47.783 --> 00:03:49.975
In part, that's because,
if you think about it,

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:51.922
we're bathing the brain in a chemical --

00:03:51.946 --> 00:03:55.306
this elaborate circuit, made of thousands
of different kinds of cell --

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.821
is being bathed in a substance.

00:03:56.845 --> 00:03:59.559
That's also why most of the drugs,
not all, on the market

00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:02.067
can present some kind
of serious side effect too.

00:04:02.091 --> 00:04:05.923
Now some people have gotten some solace
from electrical stimulators

00:04:05.947 --> 00:04:07.484
that are implanted in the brain,

00:04:07.508 --> 00:04:11.011
for Parkinson's disease
or cochlear implants.

00:04:11.035 --> 00:04:14.805
These have indeed been able
to bring some kind of remedy

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.891
to people with certain kinds of disorders.

00:04:16.915 --> 00:04:19.942
But electricity also will go
in all directions --

00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:21.450
the path of least resistance --

00:04:21.474 --> 00:04:23.722
which is where that phrase,
in part, comes from,

00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:25.511
and will also affect normal circuits,

00:04:25.535 --> 00:04:27.663
as well as the abnormal ones
you want to fix.

00:04:27.687 --> 00:04:30.650
So again, we're sent back to the idea
of ultraprecise control:

00:04:30.674 --> 00:04:33.674
Could we dial in information
precisely where we want it to go?

00:04:35.329 --> 00:04:38.430
So, when I started
in neuroscience 11 years ago --

00:04:38.454 --> 00:04:41.690
I had trained as an electrical
engineer and a physicist --

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:43.444
the first thing I thought about was,

00:04:43.468 --> 00:04:45.557
if these neurons are electrical devices,

00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:49.380
all we need to do is to find some way
of driving those electrical changes

00:04:49.404 --> 00:04:50.564
at a distance.

00:04:50.588 --> 00:04:53.903
If we could turn on the electricity
in one cell but not its neighbors,

00:04:53.927 --> 00:04:57.273
that'd give us the tool to activate
and shut down these different cells

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:58.538
to figure out what they do

00:04:58.562 --> 00:05:01.664
and how they contribute
to the networks in which they're embedded.

00:05:01.688 --> 00:05:04.653
It would also allow us to have
the ultraprecise control we need

00:05:04.677 --> 00:05:07.138
to fix the circuit computations
that have gone awry.

00:05:07.837 --> 00:05:09.458
Now, how are we going to do that?

00:05:09.482 --> 00:05:12.042
Well, there are many molecules
that exist in nature

00:05:12.066 --> 00:05:15.259
which are able to convert
light into electricity.

00:05:15.283 --> 00:05:18.494
You can think of them as little proteins
that are like solar cells.

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:21.315
If we install these molecules
in neurons somehow,

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:24.675
then these neurons would become
electrically drivable with light,

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.847
and their neighbors, which don't have
this molecule, would not.

00:05:27.871 --> 00:05:30.641
There's one other magic trick you need
to make this happen:

00:05:30.665 --> 00:05:32.573
the ability to get light into the brain.

00:05:32.597 --> 00:05:35.097
The brain doesn't feel pain.

00:05:35.121 --> 00:05:36.756
Taking advantage of all the effort

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.477
that's gone into the internet,
telecommunications, etc.,

00:05:39.501 --> 00:05:41.660
you can put optical fibers
connected to lasers

00:05:41.684 --> 00:05:45.705
to activate -- in animal models,
for example, in preclinical studies --

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.556
these neurons and see what they do.

00:05:48.135 --> 00:05:49.412
So how do we do this?

00:05:49.968 --> 00:05:53.602
Around 2004, in collaboration
with Georg Nagel and Karl Deisseroth,

00:05:53.626 --> 00:05:55.567
this vision came to fruition.

00:05:55.943 --> 00:05:58.973
There's a certain alga
that swims in the wild,

00:05:58.997 --> 00:06:02.869
and it needs to navigate towards light
in order to photosynthesize optimally.

00:06:02.893 --> 00:06:04.945
And it senses light with a little eyespot,

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:07.189
which works not unlike how our eye works.

00:06:07.681 --> 00:06:09.968
In its membrane, or its boundary,

00:06:09.992 --> 00:06:12.332
it contains little proteins

00:06:13.194 --> 00:06:15.676
that indeed can convert
light into electricity.

00:06:16.118 --> 00:06:18.668
These molecules are called
channelrhodopsins.

00:06:18.692 --> 00:06:21.470
And each of these proteins
acts just like that solar cell

00:06:21.494 --> 00:06:22.659
that I told you about.

00:06:22.683 --> 00:06:23.834
When blue light hits it,

00:06:23.858 --> 00:06:27.308
it opens a little hole and allows
charged particles to enter the eyespot;

00:06:27.332 --> 00:06:29.873
that allows this eyespot
to have an electrical signal,

00:06:29.897 --> 00:06:31.903
just like a solar cell charging a battery.

00:06:31.927 --> 00:06:34.058
So what we need to do
is take these molecules

00:06:34.082 --> 00:06:35.809
and somehow install them in neurons.

00:06:35.833 --> 00:06:37.177
And because it's a protein,

00:06:37.201 --> 00:06:40.253
it's encoded for
in the DNA of this organism.

00:06:40.277 --> 00:06:42.422
So all we've got to do is take that DNA,

00:06:42.446 --> 00:06:45.320
put it into a gene therapy
vector, like a virus,

00:06:45.344 --> 00:06:46.677
and put it into neurons.

00:06:48.276 --> 00:06:51.951
And this was a very productive time
in gene therapy,

00:06:51.975 --> 00:06:53.967
and lots of viruses were coming along,

00:06:53.991 --> 00:06:55.874
so this turned out to be fairly simple.

00:06:55.898 --> 00:06:58.357
Early in the morning
one day in the summer of 2004,

00:06:58.381 --> 00:07:00.680
we gave it a try,
and it worked on the first try.

00:07:01.057 --> 00:07:03.181
You take this DNA
and put it into the neuron.

00:07:03.205 --> 00:07:06.590
The neuron uses its natural
protein-making machinery

00:07:06.614 --> 00:07:09.070
to fabricate these little
light-sensitive proteins

00:07:09.094 --> 00:07:12.843
and install them all over the cell,
like putting solar panels on a roof.

00:07:12.867 --> 00:07:14.212
And the next thing you know,

00:07:14.236 --> 00:07:16.708
you have a neuron
which can be activated with light.

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:18.741
So this is very powerful.

00:07:18.765 --> 00:07:22.476
One of the tricks you have to do
is figure out how to deliver these genes

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.031
to the cells you want
and not all the other neighbors.

00:07:25.055 --> 00:07:26.206
And you can do that;

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.234
you can tweak the viruses
so they hit some cells and not others.

00:07:29.258 --> 00:07:31.388
And there's other genetic
tricks you can play

00:07:31.412 --> 00:07:33.739
in order to get light-activated cells.

00:07:34.206 --> 00:07:37.186
This field has now come to be known
as "optogenetics."

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.111
And just as one example
of the kind of thing you can do,

00:07:40.135 --> 00:07:41.908
you can take a complex network,

00:07:41.932 --> 00:07:44.001
use one of these viruses
to deliver the gene

00:07:44.025 --> 00:07:46.267
just to one kind of cell
in this dense network.

00:07:46.291 --> 00:07:48.839
And then when you shine light
on the entire network,

00:07:48.863 --> 00:07:50.703
just that cell type will be activated.

00:07:50.727 --> 00:07:54.034
For example, let's consider
that basket cell I told you about earlier,

00:07:54.058 --> 00:07:56.033
the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia

00:07:56.057 --> 00:07:57.593
and the one that is inhibitory.

00:07:58.291 --> 00:08:00.399
If we can deliver that gene
to these cells --

00:08:00.423 --> 00:08:03.481
they won't be altered by the expression
of the gene, of course --

00:08:03.505 --> 00:08:05.948
then flash blue light
over the entire brain network,

00:08:05.972 --> 00:08:08.111
just these cells are going to be driven.

00:08:08.135 --> 00:08:10.968
And when the light turns off,
these cells go back to normal;

00:08:10.992 --> 00:08:12.818
there don't seem to be adverse events.

00:08:12.842 --> 00:08:14.848
Not only can you study
what these cells do,

00:08:14.872 --> 00:08:17.019
what their power
is in computing in the brain,

00:08:17.043 --> 00:08:19.104
you can also use this to try to figure out

00:08:19.128 --> 00:08:21.338
if we could jazz up
the activity of these cells

00:08:21.362 --> 00:08:22.815
if indeed, they're atrophied.

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:25.907
I want to tell you some short stories
about how we're using this

00:08:25.931 --> 00:08:29.317
both at the scientific clinical
and preclinical levels.

00:08:29.341 --> 00:08:31.771
One of the questions
that we've confronted is:

00:08:31.795 --> 00:08:34.537
What signals in the brain
mediate the sensation of reward?

00:08:34.561 --> 00:08:36.097
Because if you could find those,

00:08:36.121 --> 00:08:39.007
those would be some of the signals
that could drive learning;

00:08:39.031 --> 00:08:41.227
the brain will do more
of what got that reward.

00:08:41.251 --> 00:08:44.402
These are also signals that go awry
in disorders such as addiction.

00:08:44.426 --> 00:08:48.112
So if we could figure out what cells
they are, we could maybe find new targets

00:08:48.136 --> 00:08:50.626
for which drugs can be
designed or screened against

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.901
or maybe places
where electrodes could be put in

00:08:52.925 --> 00:08:54.750
for people who have severe disability.

00:08:54.774 --> 00:08:57.162
To do that, we came up with
a very simple paradigm

00:08:57.186 --> 00:08:59.147
in collaboration with the Fiorillo group,

00:08:59.171 --> 00:09:01.860
where, if the animal goes
to one side of this little box,

00:09:01.884 --> 00:09:03.080
it gets a pulse of light.

00:09:03.104 --> 00:09:06.084
And we'll make different cells
in the brain sensitive to light.

00:09:06.108 --> 00:09:09.695
If these cells can mediate reward,
the animal should go there more and more.

00:09:09.719 --> 00:09:10.884
And that's what happens.

00:09:10.908 --> 00:09:13.866
The animal goes to the right-hand side
and pokes his nose there

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.379
and gets a flash of blue light
every time he does it.

00:09:16.403 --> 00:09:17.936
He'll do that hundreds of times.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.437
These are the dopamine neurons,

00:09:19.461 --> 00:09:21.562
in some of the pleasure
centers in the brain.

00:09:21.586 --> 00:09:25.379
We've shown that a brief activation
of these is enough to drive learning.

00:09:25.403 --> 00:09:27.448
Now we can generalize the idea.

00:09:27.472 --> 00:09:31.105
Instead of one point in the brain,
we can devise devices that span the brain,

00:09:31.129 --> 00:09:33.805
that can deliver light
into three-dimensional patterns --

00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:35.022
arrays of optical fibers,

00:09:35.046 --> 00:09:37.821
each coupled to its own independent
miniature light source.

00:09:37.845 --> 00:09:39.562
Then we can try to do things in vivo

00:09:39.586 --> 00:09:41.600
that have only been done
to date in a dish,

00:09:41.624 --> 00:09:44.356
like high-throughput screening
throughout the entire brain

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.001
for the signals that can cause
certain things to happen

00:09:47.025 --> 00:09:50.246
or that could be good clinical targets
for treating brain disorders.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.091
One story I want to tell you about is:

00:09:52.115 --> 00:09:55.329
How can we find targets for treating
post-traumatic stress disorder,

00:09:55.353 --> 00:09:58.020
a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear?

00:09:58.044 --> 00:10:02.936
One of the things that we did was to adopt
a very classical model of fear.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.937
This goes back to the Pavlovian days.

00:10:05.961 --> 00:10:09.639
It's called Pavlovian fear conditioning,
where a tone ends with a brief shock.

00:10:09.663 --> 00:10:12.107
The shock isn't painful,
but it's a little annoying.

00:10:12.131 --> 00:10:14.009
And over time -- in this case, a mouse,

00:10:14.033 --> 00:10:17.143
which is a good animal model,
commonly used in such experiments --

00:10:17.167 --> 00:10:18.847
the animal learns to fear the tone.

00:10:18.871 --> 00:10:21.938
It will react by freezing,
sort of like a deer in the headlights.

00:10:21.962 --> 00:10:24.692
Now the question is: What targets
in the brain can we find

00:10:24.716 --> 00:10:27.342
that allow us to overcome this fear?

00:10:27.366 --> 00:10:31.111
So we play that tone again,
after it's been associated with fear.

00:10:31.135 --> 00:10:33.331
But we activate
different targets in the brain,

00:10:33.355 --> 00:10:36.337
using that optical fiber array
I showed on the previous slide,

00:10:36.361 --> 00:10:37.794
in order to try and figure out

00:10:37.818 --> 00:10:41.088
which targets can cause the brain
to overcome that memory of fear.

00:10:41.112 --> 00:10:43.402
This brief video shows you
one of these targets

00:10:43.426 --> 00:10:44.680
that we're working on now.

00:10:44.704 --> 00:10:48.341
This is an area in the prefrontal cortex,
a region where we can use cognition

00:10:48.365 --> 00:10:50.469
to try to overcome
aversive emotional states.

00:10:50.493 --> 00:10:52.786
The animal hears a tone.
A flash of light occurs.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:55.438
There's no audio, but you see
that the animal freezes --

00:10:55.462 --> 00:10:56.941
the tone used to mean bad news.

00:10:56.965 --> 00:10:59.448
There's a little clock
in the lower left-hand corner.

00:10:59.472 --> 00:11:02.002
You can see the animal
is about two minutes into this.

00:11:02.026 --> 00:11:04.240
This next clip
is just eight minutes later.

00:11:04.264 --> 00:11:07.788
And the same tone is going to play,
and the light is going to flash again.

00:11:08.294 --> 00:11:11.470
OK, there it goes. Right ... now.

00:11:11.494 --> 00:11:14.184
And now you can see,
just 10 minutes into the experiment,

00:11:14.208 --> 00:11:17.028
that we've equipped the brain,
by photoactivating this area,

00:11:17.052 --> 00:11:20.157
to overcome the expression
of this fear memory.

00:11:21.262 --> 00:11:24.290
Over the last couple years,
we've gone back to the tree of life,

00:11:24.314 --> 00:11:27.411
because we wanted to find ways
to turn circuits in the brain off.

00:11:27.435 --> 00:11:29.975
If we could do that,
this could be extremely powerful.

00:11:29.999 --> 00:11:32.724
If you can delete cells
for a few milliseconds or seconds,

00:11:32.748 --> 00:11:36.558
you can figure out what role they play
in the circuits in which they're embedded.

00:11:36.582 --> 00:11:39.158
We surveyed organisms
from all over the tree of life --

00:11:39.182 --> 00:11:42.143
every kingdom of life but animals;
we see slightly differently.

00:11:42.167 --> 00:11:45.036
We found molecules called
halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins,

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:46.926
that respond to green and yellow light.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.053
And they do the opposite
of the molecule I told you about before,

00:11:50.077 --> 00:11:52.562
with the blue light activator,
channelrhodopsin.

00:11:52.586 --> 00:11:55.413
Let's give an example
of where we think this is going to go.

00:11:55.437 --> 00:11:58.235
Consider, for example,
a condition like epilepsy,

00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:00.349
where the brain is overactive.

00:12:00.373 --> 00:12:02.488
Now, if drugs fail in epileptic treatment,

00:12:02.512 --> 00:12:04.997
one of the strategies
is to remove part of the brain,

00:12:05.021 --> 00:12:07.704
but that's irreversible,
and there could be side effects.

00:12:07.728 --> 00:12:11.014
What if we could just turn off that brain
for the brief amount of time

00:12:11.038 --> 00:12:12.418
until the seizure dies away,

00:12:12.442 --> 00:12:15.856
and cause the brain to be restored
to its initial state,

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.186
like a dynamical system that's being
coaxed down into a stable state?

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.272
This animation tries
to explain this concept

00:12:21.296 --> 00:12:24.483
where we made these cells sensitive
to being turned off with light,

00:12:24.507 --> 00:12:25.659
and we beam light in,

00:12:25.683 --> 00:12:28.211
and just for the time it takes
to shut down a seizure,

00:12:28.235 --> 00:12:30.106
we're hoping to be able to turn it off.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.242
We don't have data
to show you on this front,

00:12:32.266 --> 00:12:33.902
but we're very excited about this.

00:12:33.926 --> 00:12:37.348
I want to close on one story,
which we think is another possibility,

00:12:37.372 --> 00:12:40.765
which is that maybe these molecules,
if you can do ultraprecise control,

00:12:40.789 --> 00:12:43.842
can be used in the brain itself
to make a new kind of prosthetic,

00:12:43.866 --> 00:12:45.018
an optical prosthetic.

00:12:45.042 --> 00:12:48.171
I already told you that electrical
stimulators are not uncommon.

00:12:48.195 --> 00:12:49.539
Seventy-five thousand people

00:12:49.563 --> 00:12:51.911
have Parkinson's deep-brain
stimulators implanted,

00:12:51.935 --> 00:12:55.528
maybe 100,000 people have cochlear
implants, which allow them to hear.

00:12:55.552 --> 00:12:58.336
Another thing -- you've got
to get these genes into cells.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.604
A new hope in gene therapy
has been developed,

00:13:00.628 --> 00:13:03.237
because viruses like
the adeno-associated virus --

00:13:03.261 --> 00:13:05.508
which probably most of us
around this room have;

00:13:05.532 --> 00:13:07.024
it doesn't have any symptoms --

00:13:07.048 --> 00:13:08.862
have been used in hundreds of patients

00:13:08.886 --> 00:13:10.945
to deliver genes
into the brain or the body.

00:13:10.969 --> 00:13:13.502
And so far, there have not been
serious adverse events

00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:14.769
associated with the virus.

00:13:14.793 --> 00:13:17.765
There's one last elephant
in the room: the proteins themselves,

00:13:17.789 --> 00:13:19.892
which come from algae,
bacteria and funguses

00:13:19.916 --> 00:13:21.592
and all over the tree of life.

00:13:21.616 --> 00:13:24.148
Most of us don't have funguses
or algae in our brains,

00:13:24.172 --> 00:13:26.225
so what will our brain do
if we put that in?

00:13:26.249 --> 00:13:28.919
Will the cells tolerate it?
Will the immune system react?

00:13:28.943 --> 00:13:31.468
It's early -- these haven't
been done in humans yet --

00:13:31.492 --> 00:13:34.222
but we're working on a variety
of studies to examine this.

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:37.094
So far, we haven't seen
overt reactions of any severity

00:13:37.118 --> 00:13:38.388
to these molecules

00:13:38.412 --> 00:13:41.976
or to the illumination
of the brain with light.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.111
So it's early days, to be upfront,
but we're excited about it.

00:13:45.135 --> 00:13:46.752
I wanted to close with one story,

00:13:46.776 --> 00:13:50.005
which we think could potentially
be a clinical application.

00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:53.388
Now, there are many forms of blindness

00:13:53.412 --> 00:13:56.648
where the photoreceptors --
light sensors in the back of our eye --

00:13:56.672 --> 00:13:57.831
are gone.

00:13:57.855 --> 00:13:59.697
And the retina is a complex structure.

00:13:59.721 --> 00:14:02.383
Let's zoom in on it
so we can see it in more detail.

00:14:02.407 --> 00:14:04.805
The photoreceptor cells
are shown here at the top.

00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:07.991
The signals that are detected
by the photoreceptors are transformed

00:14:08.015 --> 00:14:09.170
via various computations

00:14:09.194 --> 00:14:12.438
until finally, the layer of cells
at the bottom, the ganglion cells,

00:14:12.462 --> 00:14:14.151
relay the information to the brain,

00:14:14.175 --> 00:14:15.739
where we see that as perception.

00:14:16.318 --> 00:14:18.805
In many forms of blindness,
like retinitis pigmentosa

00:14:18.829 --> 00:14:20.535
or macular degeneration,

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:23.334
the photoreceptor cells
have atrophied or been destroyed.

00:14:23.904 --> 00:14:25.763
Now, how could you repair this?

00:14:25.787 --> 00:14:28.801
It's not even clear that a drug
could cause this to be restored,

00:14:28.825 --> 00:14:30.970
since there's nothing
for the drug to bind to.

00:14:30.994 --> 00:14:33.428
On the other hand,
light can still get into the eye.

00:14:33.452 --> 00:14:35.991
The eye is still transparent
and you can get light in.

00:14:36.015 --> 00:14:39.209
So what if we could take these
channelrhodopsins and other molecules

00:14:39.233 --> 00:14:41.666
and install them
on some of these other spared cells

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:43.461
and convert them into little cameras?

00:14:43.485 --> 00:14:46.159
And because there are so many
of these cells in the eye,

00:14:46.183 --> 00:14:48.819
potentially, they could be
very high-resolution cameras.

00:14:48.843 --> 00:14:50.517
This is some work that we're doing,

00:14:50.541 --> 00:14:53.555
led by one of our collaborators,
Alan Horsager at USC,

00:14:53.579 --> 00:14:57.254
and being sought to be commercialized
by a start-up company, Eos Neuroscience,

00:14:57.278 --> 00:14:58.570
which is funded by the NIH.

00:14:58.594 --> 00:15:01.638
What you see here is a mouse
trying to solve a six-arm maze.

00:15:01.662 --> 00:15:05.298
There's a bit of water to motivate
the mouse to move or he'll just sit there.

00:15:05.322 --> 00:15:07.581
The goal of this maze
is to get out of the water

00:15:07.605 --> 00:15:10.640
and go to a little platform
that's under the lit top port.

00:15:11.338 --> 00:15:13.914
Mice are smart, so this one
solves the maze eventually,

00:15:13.938 --> 00:15:15.514
but he does a brute-force search.

00:15:15.538 --> 00:15:18.836
He's swimming down every avenue
until he finally gets to the platform.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.944
He's not using vision to do it.

00:15:20.968 --> 00:15:23.027
These different mice
are different mutations

00:15:23.051 --> 00:15:26.154
that recapitulate different kinds
of blindness that affect humans.

00:15:26.178 --> 00:15:29.285
So we're being careful in trying
to look at these different models

00:15:29.309 --> 00:15:31.410
so we come up with a generalized approach.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:33.111
So how can we solve this?

00:15:33.135 --> 00:15:35.764
We'll do exactly what we outlined
in the previous slide.

00:15:35.788 --> 00:15:37.748
We'll take these blue light photo sensors

00:15:37.772 --> 00:15:39.590
and install them onto a layer of cells

00:15:39.614 --> 00:15:41.957
in the middle of the retina
in the back of the eye

00:15:41.981 --> 00:15:43.605
and convert them into a camera --

00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:46.215
just like installing solar cells
all over those neurons

00:15:46.239 --> 00:15:47.635
to make them light-sensitive.

00:15:47.659 --> 00:15:49.953
Light is converted to electricity on them.

00:15:49.977 --> 00:15:52.871
So this mouse was blind
a couple weeks before this experiment

00:15:52.895 --> 00:15:56.103
and received one dose of this
photosensitive molecule on a virus.

00:15:56.127 --> 00:15:58.669
And now you can see,
the animal can indeed avoid walls

00:15:58.693 --> 00:16:00.134
and go to this little platform

00:16:00.158 --> 00:16:03.355
and make cognitive use of its eyes again.

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:05.112
And to point out the power of this:

00:16:05.136 --> 00:16:06.960
these animals can get to that platform

00:16:06.984 --> 00:16:09.709
just as fast as animals
that have seen their entire lives.

00:16:09.733 --> 00:16:11.883
So this preclinical study,
I think, bodes hope

00:16:11.907 --> 00:16:14.677
for the kinds of things
we're hoping to do in the future.

00:16:15.555 --> 00:16:20.048
We're also exploring new business models
for this new field of neurotechnology.

00:16:20.072 --> 00:16:22.223
We're developing tools
and sharing them freely

00:16:22.247 --> 00:16:24.300
with hundreds of groups all over the world

00:16:24.324 --> 00:16:26.904
for them to study and try
to treat different disorders.

00:16:26.928 --> 00:16:29.181
Our hope is that
by figuring out brain circuits

00:16:29.205 --> 00:16:32.452
at a level of abstraction that lets us
repair them and engineer them,

00:16:32.476 --> 00:16:35.673
we can take some of these intractable
disorders I mentioned earlier,

00:16:35.697 --> 00:16:37.416
practically none of which are cured,

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.462
and in the 21st century,
make them history.

00:16:39.486 --> 00:16:40.647
Thank you.

00:16:40.671 --> 00:16:46.841
(Applause)

00:16:53.967 --> 00:16:56.627
Juan Enriquez: So some of this stuff
is a little dense.

00:16:56.651 --> 00:16:58.627
(Laughter)

00:16:59.083 --> 00:17:03.691
But the implications of being able
to control seizures or epilepsy

00:17:03.715 --> 00:17:05.692
with light instead of drugs

00:17:05.716 --> 00:17:08.370
and being able to target
those specifically

00:17:08.394 --> 00:17:09.910
is a first step.

00:17:10.642 --> 00:17:12.786
The second thing
that I think I heard you say

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:17.638
is you can now control
the brain in two colors,

00:17:17.662 --> 00:17:18.923
like an on-off switch.

00:17:18.947 --> 00:17:20.111
Ed Boyden: That's right.

00:17:20.135 --> 00:17:23.348
JE: Which makes every impulse going
through the brain a binary code.

00:17:23.372 --> 00:17:24.523
EB: Right.

00:17:24.547 --> 00:17:27.999
With blue light, we can drive information,
and it's in the form of a one.

00:17:28.023 --> 00:17:30.467
And by turning things off,
it's more or less a zero.

00:17:30.491 --> 00:17:34.040
Our hope is to eventually build brain
coprocessors that work with the brain

00:17:34.064 --> 00:17:36.710
so we can augment functions
in people with disabilities.

00:17:36.734 --> 00:17:42.289
JE: And in theory, that means that,
as a mouse feels, smells, hears, touches,

00:17:42.313 --> 00:17:45.634
you can model it out
as a string of ones and zeros.

00:17:45.658 --> 00:17:48.198
EB: Yeah. We're hoping
to use this as a way of testing

00:17:48.222 --> 00:17:50.344
what neural codes
can drive certain behaviors

00:17:50.368 --> 00:17:52.351
and certain thoughts and certain feelings

00:17:52.375 --> 00:17:54.889
and use that to understand
more about the brain.

00:17:54.913 --> 00:17:57.745
JE: Does that mean that someday
you could download memories

00:17:57.769 --> 00:17:59.424
and maybe upload them?

00:17:59.448 --> 00:18:02.131
EB: That's something we're starting
to work on very hard.

00:18:02.155 --> 00:18:05.709
We're now working on trying to tile
the brain with recording elements, too,

00:18:05.733 --> 00:18:08.839
so we can record information
and then drive information back in --

00:18:08.863 --> 00:18:10.676
sort of computing what the brain needs

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.906
in order to augment
its information processing.

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.507
JE: Well, that might change
a couple things. Thank you.

00:18:15.531 --> 00:18:16.682
EB: Thank you.

00:18:16.706 --> 00:18:19.244
(Applause)
