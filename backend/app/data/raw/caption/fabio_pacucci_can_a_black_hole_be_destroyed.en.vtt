00:00:06.862 --> 00:00:11.772
Black holes are among the most 
destructive objects in the universe.

00:00:11.772 --> 00:00:16.272
Anything that gets too close to the 
central singularity of a black hole,

00:00:16.272 --> 00:00:19.112
be it an asteroid, planet, or star,

00:00:19.112 --> 00:00:23.802
risks being torn apart by its 
extreme gravitational field.

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:28.525
And if the approaching object happens 
to cross the black hole’s event horizon,

00:00:28.525 --> 00:00:31.636
it’ll disappear and never re-emerge,

00:00:31.636 --> 00:00:36.046
adding to the black hole’s mass and 
expanding its radius in the process.

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:38.695
There is nothing we could throw 
at a black hole

00:00:38.695 --> 00:00:41.205
that would do the least bit of 
damage to it.

00:00:41.205 --> 00:00:43.985
Even another black hole won’t destroy it–

00:00:43.985 --> 00:00:47.405
the two will simply merge into a larger
black hole,

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:52.035
releasing a bit of energy as gravitational
waves in the process.

00:00:52.035 --> 00:00:53.170
By some accounts,

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.570
it’s possible that the universe may 
eventually consist entirely of black holes

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.375
in a very distant future.

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:05.605
And yet, there may be a way to destroy, 
or “evaporate,” these objects after all.

00:01:05.605 --> 00:01:07.165
If the theory is true,

00:01:07.165 --> 00:01:10.115
all we need to do is to wait.

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:11.385
In 1974,

00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:13.685
Stephen Hawking theorized a process

00:01:13.685 --> 00:01:16.815
that could lead a black hole 
to gradually lose mass.

00:01:16.815 --> 00:01:19.665
Hawking radiation, as it came to be known,

00:01:19.665 --> 00:01:25.515
is based on a well-established phenomenon
called quantum fluctuations of the vacuum.

00:01:25.515 --> 00:01:27.295
According to quantum mechanics,

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:32.725
a given point in spacetime fluctuates 
between multiple possible energy states.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:37.306
These fluctuations are driven by the 
continuous creation and destruction

00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:39.607
of virtual particle pairs,

00:01:39.607 --> 00:01:44.247
which consist of a particle and its 
oppositely charged antiparticle.

00:01:44.247 --> 00:01:48.830
Normally, the two collide and annihilate 
each other shortly after appearing,

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.890
preserving the total energy.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.510
But what happens when they appear just at
the edge of a black hole’s event horizon?

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.578
If they’re positioned just right,

00:01:58.578 --> 00:02:01.798
one of the particles could escape the 
black hole’s pull

00:02:01.798 --> 00:02:04.248
while its counterpart falls in.

00:02:04.248 --> 00:02:08.028
It would then annihilate another 
oppositely charged particle

00:02:08.028 --> 00:02:10.358
within the event horizon 
of the black hole,

00:02:10.358 --> 00:02:12.658
reducing the black hole’s mass.

00:02:12.658 --> 00:02:14.928
Meanwhile, to an outside observer,

00:02:14.928 --> 00:02:19.358
it would look like the black hole 
had emitted the escaped particle.

00:02:19.358 --> 00:02:24.705
Thus, unless a black hole continues 
to absorb additional matter and energy,

00:02:24.705 --> 00:02:30.255
it’ll evaporate particle by particle, 
at an excruciatingly slow rate.

00:02:30.255 --> 00:02:31.212
How slow?

00:02:31.212 --> 00:02:36.872
A branch of physics, called black hole
thermodynamics, gives us an answer.

00:02:36.872 --> 00:02:41.713
When everyday objects or celestial bodies
release energy to their environment,

00:02:41.713 --> 00:02:43.581
we perceive that as heat,

00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:47.181
and can use their energy emission to 
measure their temperature.

00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:48.711
Black hole thermodynamics

00:02:48.711 --> 00:02:53.461
suggests that we can similarly define the
“temperature” of a black hole.

00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:56.421
It theorizes that the more massive the 
black hole,

00:02:56.421 --> 00:02:58.021
the lower its temperature.

00:02:58.021 --> 00:03:00.301
The universe’s largest black holes

00:03:00.301 --> 00:03:06.001
would give off temperatures of the
order of 10 to the -17th power Kelvin,

00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:08.921
very close to absolute zero.

00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:12.651
Meanwhile, one with the
mass of the asteroid Vesta

00:03:12.651 --> 00:03:16.461
would have a temperature close to 200
degrees Celsius,

00:03:16.461 --> 00:03:20.661
thus releasing a lot of energy 
in the form of Hawking Radiation

00:03:20.661 --> 00:03:23.207
to the cold outside environment.

00:03:23.207 --> 00:03:24.827
The smaller the black hole,

00:03:24.827 --> 00:03:26.947
the hotter it seems to be burning–

00:03:26.947 --> 00:03:29.817
and the sooner it’ll burn out completely.

00:03:29.817 --> 00:03:30.917
Just how soon?

00:03:30.917 --> 00:03:32.397
Well, don’t hold your breath.

00:03:32.397 --> 00:03:37.397
First of all, most black holes accrete, 
or absorb matter and energy,

00:03:37.397 --> 00:03:40.530
more quickly than they emit
Hawking radiation.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.100
But even if a black hole with the 
mass of our Sun stopped accreting,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.813
it would take 10 to the 67th power years–

00:03:48.813 --> 00:03:53.063
many many magnitudes longer than the
current age of the Universe—

00:03:53.063 --> 00:03:54.925
to fully evaporate.

00:03:54.925 --> 00:03:58.925
When a black hole reaches 
about 230 metric tons,

00:03:58.925 --> 00:04:02.135
it’ll have only one more second to live.

00:04:02.135 --> 00:04:03.665
In that final second,

00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:06.805
its event horizon becomes 
increasingly tiny,

00:04:06.805 --> 00:04:11.085
until finally releasing all of its energy 
back into the universe.

00:04:11.093 --> 00:04:14.643
And while Hawking radiation has never 
been directly observed,

00:04:14.643 --> 00:04:19.833
some scientists believe that certain gamma
ray flashes detected in the sky

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:22.607
are actually traces of the last moments

00:04:22.607 --> 00:04:28.157
of small, primordial black holes formed 
at the dawn of time.

00:04:28.157 --> 00:04:32.329
Eventually, in an almost inconceivably
distant future,

00:04:32.329 --> 00:04:36.075
the universe may be left 
as a cold and dark place.

00:04:36.075 --> 00:04:37.805
But if Stephen Hawking was right,

00:04:37.805 --> 00:04:39.335
before that happens,

00:04:39.335 --> 00:04:43.935
the normally terrifying and otherwise
impervious black holes

00:04:43.935 --> 00:04:47.886
will end their existence in a final 
blaze of glory.
