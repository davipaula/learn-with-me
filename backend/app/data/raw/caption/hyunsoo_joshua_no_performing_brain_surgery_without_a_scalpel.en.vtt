00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:11.920
Every year, tens of thousands of people
world-wide have brain surgery

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.200
without a single incision:

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.540
there’s no scalpel, no operating table, 
and the patient loses no blood.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.641
Instead, this procedure takes place 
in a shielded room

00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:28.173
with a large machine that emits 
invisible beams of light

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:31.493
at a precise target inside the brain.

00:00:31.493 --> 00:00:35.493
This treatment is called 
stereotactic radiosurgery,

00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:39.323
and those light beams 
are beams of radiation:

00:00:39.323 --> 00:00:45.383
their task is to destroy tumors by
gradually scrubbing away malignant cells.

00:00:45.383 --> 00:00:49.143
For patients, the process begins 
with a CT-scan,

00:00:49.143 --> 00:00:54.013
a series of x-rays that produce 
a three-dimensional map of the head.

00:00:54.013 --> 00:00:59.654
This reveals the precise location, size,
and shape of the tumor within.

00:00:59.654 --> 00:01:05.048
The CT-scans also help to calculate
something called "Hounsfield Units,"

00:01:05.048 --> 00:01:08.318
which show the densities
of different tissues.

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:11.238
This offers information 
about how radiation

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:15.403
will propagate through the brain,
to better optimize its effects.

00:01:15.403 --> 00:01:20.331
Doctors might also use 
magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI’s,

00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:23.641
that produce finer images of soft tissue,

00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:28.248
to assist in better outlining 
a tumor’s shape and location.

00:01:28.248 --> 00:01:31.798
Mapping its precise position and size 
is crucial

00:01:31.798 --> 00:01:36.204
because of the high doses of radiation
needed to treat tumors.

00:01:36.204 --> 00:01:40.306
Radiosurgery depends on the use
of multiple beams.

00:01:40.306 --> 00:01:44.036
Individually, each delivers a low dose
of radiation.

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:48.357
But, like several stage lights converging
on the same point

00:01:48.357 --> 00:01:53.015
to create a bright and inescapable
spotlight, when combined,

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:58.523
the rays of radiation collectively
produce enough power to destroy tumors.

00:01:58.523 --> 00:02:02.343
In addition to enabling doctors to target
tumors in the brain

00:02:02.343 --> 00:02:05.753
while leaving the surrounding 
healthy tissue relatively unharmed,

00:02:05.753 --> 00:02:09.856
the use of multiple beams 
also gives doctors flexibility.

00:02:09.856 --> 00:02:14.389
They can optimize the best angles 
and routes through brain tissue

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:18.441
to reach the target and adjust 
the intensity within each beam

00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:19.941
as necessary.

00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:22.951
This helps spare critical structures
within the brain.

00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:28.118
But what exactly does this ingenious
approach do to the tumors in question?

00:02:28.118 --> 00:02:33.796
When several beams of radiation intersect
to strike a mass of cancerous cells,

00:02:33.796 --> 00:02:38.203
their combined force essentially
shears the cells’ DNA,

00:02:38.203 --> 00:02:41.343
causing a breakdown
in the cells’ structure.

00:02:41.343 --> 00:02:46.198
Over time, this process cascades 
into destroying the whole tumor.

00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:51.670
Indirectly, the rays also damage the area
immediately surrounding the DNA,

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.819
creating unstable particles
called free radicals.

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.359
This generates a hazardous 
microenvironment

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.439
that’s inhospitable to the tumor,

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:03.839
as well as some healthy cells 
in the immediate vicinity.

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:07.279
The risk of harming non-cancerous tissue
is reduced

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:09.699
by keeping the radiation beam coverage

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:14.110
as close to the exact shape
of the tumor as possible.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.000
Once radiosurgery treatment has destroyed
the tumor’s cells,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.300
the body’s natural cleaning
mechanism kicks in.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.300
The immune system rapidly sweeps
up the husks of dead cells

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.492
to flush them out of the body, while
other cells transform into scar tissue.

00:03:30.492 --> 00:03:35.304
Despite its innovations, radiosurgery
isn’t always the primary choice

00:03:35.304 --> 00:03:37.614
for all brain cancer treatments.

00:03:37.614 --> 00:03:41.744
For starters, it’s typically reserved 
for smaller tumors.

00:03:41.744 --> 00:03:44.454
Radiation also has a cumulative effect,

00:03:44.454 --> 00:03:49.010
meaning that earlier doses can overlap
with those delivered later on.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.380
So patients with recurrent tumors

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.604
may have limitations with future
radiosurgery treatments.

00:03:55.604 --> 00:04:00.667
But these disadvantages weigh up 
against some much larger benefits.

00:04:00.667 --> 00:04:02.797
For several types of brain tumors,

00:04:02.797 --> 00:04:06.637
radiosurgery can be as successful 
as traditional brain surgery

00:04:06.637 --> 00:04:08.597
at destroying cancerous cells.

00:04:08.597 --> 00:04:13.829
In tumors called meningiomas, 
recurrence is found to be equal, or lower,

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.679
when the patient undergoes radiosurgery.

00:04:16.679 --> 00:04:18.639
And compared to traditional surgery—

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.979
often a painful experience 
with a long recovery period—

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.739
radiosurgery is generally pain-free,

00:04:24.739 --> 00:04:28.479
and often requires 
little to no recovery time.

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.049
Brain tumors aren’t the only target 
for this type of treatment:

00:04:32.049 --> 00:04:37.187
its concepts have been put to use on
tumors of the lungs, liver, and pancreas.

00:04:37.187 --> 00:04:41.187
Meanwhile, doctors are experimenting
with using it to treat conditions

00:04:41.187 --> 00:04:46.583
such as Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy,
and obsessive compulsive disorder.

00:04:46.583 --> 00:04:49.693
The pain of a cancer diagnosis 
can be devastating,

00:04:49.693 --> 00:04:52.733
but advancements in these 
non-invasive procedures

00:04:52.733 --> 00:04:55.853
are paving a pathway
for a more gentle cure.
