00:00:12.396 --> 00:00:15.285
Nearly everyone in the world
is part of some community,

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:16.952
whether large or small.

00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:19.998
And all of these communities
have similar needs.

00:00:20.022 --> 00:00:21.202
They need light,

00:00:21.226 --> 00:00:22.390
they need heat

00:00:22.414 --> 00:00:23.760
they need air-conditioning.

00:00:23.784 --> 00:00:26.979
People can't function very well
when it's too hot or too cold.

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:31.449
They need food to be grown or provided,
distributed and stored safely.

00:00:31.473 --> 00:00:35.553
They need waste products to be collected,
removed and processed.

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:39.004
People in the community need to be able
to get from one place to another

00:00:39.028 --> 00:00:40.202
as quickly as possible.

00:00:40.226 --> 00:00:43.548
And a supply of energy is the basis
for all of these activities.

00:00:43.572 --> 00:00:46.902
Energy in the form of electricity
provides light and air-conditioning.

00:00:46.926 --> 00:00:48.900
Energy in the form of heat keeps us warm.

00:00:48.924 --> 00:00:51.970
And energy in chemical
form provides fertilizer;

00:00:51.994 --> 00:00:54.799
it drives farm machinery
and transportation energy.

00:00:54.823 --> 00:00:56.793
Now, I spent 10 years working at NASA.

00:00:56.817 --> 00:00:59.528
In the beginning of my time there in 2000,

00:00:59.552 --> 00:01:01.552
I was very interested in communities.

00:01:01.576 --> 00:01:04.211
But this is the kind of community
I was thinking of --

00:01:04.235 --> 00:01:05.476
a lunar community

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.802
It had all of the same needs
as a community on Earth would have,

00:01:08.826 --> 00:01:11.378
but it had some very unique constraints.

00:01:11.402 --> 00:01:13.933
And we had to think about
how we would provide energy

00:01:13.957 --> 00:01:15.475
for this very unique community.

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:16.971
There’s no coal on the Moon.

00:01:16.995 --> 00:01:18.333
There's no petroleum.

00:01:18.357 --> 00:01:20.034
There’s no natural gas.

00:01:20.058 --> 00:01:21.241
There's no atmosphere.

00:01:21.265 --> 00:01:22.526
There’s no wind, either.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.604
And solar power had a real problem:

00:01:24.628 --> 00:01:27.115
the Moon orbits the Earth once a month.

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:29.140
For two weeks, the sun goes down,

00:01:29.164 --> 00:01:31.378
and your solar panels
don't make any energy.

00:01:31.402 --> 00:01:34.670
If you want to try to store
enough energy in batteries for two weeks,

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:36.187
it just simply isn't practical.

00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:38.335
So nuclear energy
was really the only choice.

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.742
Now, back in 2000, I didn't really know
too much about nuclear power,

00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:43.156
so I started trying to learn.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.536
Almost all of the nuclear power
we use on Earth today uses water

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.846
as a basic coolant.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.920
This has some advantages,
but it has a lot of disadvantages.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:54.542
If you want to generate electricity,
you have to get the water a lot hotter

00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:55.732
than you normally can.

00:01:55.756 --> 00:01:59.255
At normal pressures, water will boil
at 100 degrees Celsius.

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:03.005
This isn't nearly hot enough
to generate electricity effectively.

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:06.320
So water-cooled reactors have to run
at much higher pressures

00:02:06.344 --> 00:02:07.836
than atmospheric pressure.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.955
Some water-cooled reactors run
at over 70 atmospheres of pressure,

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:15.614
and others have to run at as much as
150 atmospheres of pressure.

00:02:15.638 --> 00:02:17.131
There's no getting around this;

00:02:17.155 --> 00:02:20.363
it's simply what you have to do
if you want to generate electricity

00:02:20.387 --> 00:02:21.795
using a water-cooled reactor.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.308
This means you have to build
a water-cooled reactor

00:02:24.332 --> 00:02:25.491
as a pressure vessel,

00:02:25.515 --> 00:02:27.889
with steel walls
over 20 centimeters thick.

00:02:27.913 --> 00:02:30.175
If that sounds heavy,
that's because it is.

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:32.387
Things get a lot worse
if you have an accident

00:02:32.411 --> 00:02:34.484
where you lose pressure
inside the reactor.

00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:37.346
If you have liquid water
at 300 degrees Celsius

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.043
and suddenly you depressurize it,

00:02:39.067 --> 00:02:40.857
it doesn't stay liquid for very long;

00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:42.083
it flashes into steam.

00:02:42.107 --> 00:02:46.077
So water-cooled reactors are built
inside of big, thick concrete buildings

00:02:46.101 --> 00:02:47.529
called containment buildings,

00:02:47.553 --> 00:02:51.103
which are meant to hold all of the steam
that would come out of the reactor

00:02:51.127 --> 00:02:53.348
if you had an accident
where you lost pressure.

00:02:53.372 --> 00:02:57.097
Steam takes up about 1,000 times
more volume than liquid water,

00:02:57.121 --> 00:02:59.611
so the containment building
ends up being very large,

00:02:59.635 --> 00:03:01.361
relative to the size of the reactor.

00:03:01.385 --> 00:03:03.561
Another bad thing happens
if you lose pressure

00:03:03.585 --> 00:03:05.119
and your water flashes to steam.

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:08.098
If you don't get emergency coolant
to the fuel in the reactor,

00:03:08.122 --> 00:03:09.560
it can overheat and melt.

00:03:09.584 --> 00:03:13.388
The reactors we have today
use uranium oxide as a fuel.

00:03:13.412 --> 00:03:15.776
It's a ceramic material
similar in performance

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.753
to the ceramics we use to make
coffee cups or cookware

00:03:18.777 --> 00:03:20.893
or the bricks we use to line fireplaces.

00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:22.178
They're chemically stable,

00:03:22.202 --> 00:03:24.408
but they're not very good
at transferring heat.

00:03:24.432 --> 00:03:26.459
If you lose pressure, you lose your water,

00:03:26.483 --> 00:03:28.082
and soon your fuel will melt down

00:03:28.106 --> 00:03:30.707
and release the radioactive
fission products within it.

00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:33.836
Making solid nuclear fuel
is a complicated and expensive process.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.392
And we extract less than one percent
of the energy for the nuclear fuel

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:39.572
before it can no longer
remain in the reactor.

00:03:39.596 --> 00:03:42.332
Water-cooled reactors have
another additional challenge:

00:03:42.356 --> 00:03:44.661
they need to be near
large bodies of water,

00:03:44.685 --> 00:03:47.474
where the steam they generate
can be cooled and condensed.

00:03:47.498 --> 00:03:49.760
Otherwise, they can't generate
electrical power.

00:03:49.784 --> 00:03:51.886
Now, there's no lakes
or rivers on the Moon,

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.719
so if all of this makes it sound
like water-cooled reactors

00:03:54.743 --> 00:03:56.846
aren't such a good fit
for a lunar community,

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.359
I would tend to agree with you.

00:03:58.383 --> 00:03:59.434
(Laughter)

00:03:59.458 --> 00:04:02.928
I had the good fortune to learn about
a different form of nuclear power

00:04:02.952 --> 00:04:04.727
that doesn't have all these problems,

00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:05.983
for a very simple reason:

00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:09.064
it's not based on water-cooling,
and it doesn't use solid fuel.

00:04:09.088 --> 00:04:11.306
Surprisingly, it's based on salt.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.416
One day, I was at a friend's
office at work,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.297
and I noticed this book on the shelf,
"Fluid Fuel Reactors."

00:04:16.321 --> 00:04:18.782
I was interested
and asked him if I could borrow it.

00:04:18.806 --> 00:04:21.784
Inside that book, I learned
about research in the United States

00:04:21.808 --> 00:04:22.975
back in the 1950s,

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:25.556
into a kind of reactor
that wasn't based on solid fuel

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.751
or on water-cooling.

00:04:26.775 --> 00:04:29.440
It didn't have the problems
of the water-cooled reactor,

00:04:29.464 --> 00:04:31.213
and the reason why was pretty neat.

00:04:31.237 --> 00:04:34.448
It used a mixture of fluoride salts
as a nuclear fuel,

00:04:34.472 --> 00:04:37.891
specifically, the fluorides of lithium,
beryllium, uranium and thorium.

00:04:37.915 --> 00:04:40.306
Fluoride salts are remarkably
chemically stable.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.519
They do not react with air and water.

00:04:42.543 --> 00:04:45.392
You have to heat them up
to about 400 degrees Celsius

00:04:45.416 --> 00:04:46.570
to get them to melt.

00:04:46.594 --> 00:04:49.237
But that's actually perfect
for trying to generate power

00:04:49.261 --> 00:04:50.415
in a nuclear reactor.

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:51.600
Here's the real magic:

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.903
they don't have to operate
at high pressure.

00:04:53.927 --> 00:04:56.058
And that makes the biggest
difference of all.

00:04:56.082 --> 00:04:59.550
This means they don't have to be
in heavy, thick steel pressure vessels,

00:04:59.574 --> 00:05:01.502
they don't have to use water for coolant

00:05:01.526 --> 00:05:03.155
and there's nothing in the reactor

00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:05.899
that's going to make
a big change in density, like water.

00:05:05.923 --> 00:05:08.084
So the containment building
around the reactor

00:05:08.108 --> 00:05:09.967
can be much smaller and close-fitting.

00:05:09.991 --> 00:05:13.162
Unlike the solid fuels that can melt down
if you stop cooling them,

00:05:13.186 --> 00:05:15.401
these liquid fluoride fuels
are already melted,

00:05:15.425 --> 00:05:17.066
at a much, much lower temperature.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.381
In normal operation,
you have a little plug here

00:05:19.405 --> 00:05:21.121
at the bottom of the reactor vessel.

00:05:21.145 --> 00:05:23.745
This plug is made
out of a piece of frozen salt

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:25.795
that you've kept frozen
by blowing cool gas

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:27.209
over the outside of the pipe.

00:05:27.233 --> 00:05:29.874
If there's an emergency
and you lose all the power

00:05:29.898 --> 00:05:31.276
to your nuclear power plant,

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.980
the little blower stops blowing,

00:05:33.004 --> 00:05:34.792
the frozen plug of salt melts,

00:05:34.816 --> 00:05:37.180
and the liquid fluoride fuel
inside the reactor

00:05:37.204 --> 00:05:39.235
drains out of the vessel, through the line

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:41.369
and into another vessel
called a drain tank.

00:05:41.393 --> 00:05:45.279
Inside the drain tank, it's all configured
to maximize the transfer of heat,

00:05:45.303 --> 00:05:47.600
so as to keep the salt passively cooled

00:05:47.624 --> 00:05:49.496
as its heat load drops over time.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.177
In water-cooled reactors,

00:05:51.201 --> 00:05:53.466
you generally have to provide
power to the plant

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.178
to keep the water circulating
and to prevent a meltdown,

00:05:56.202 --> 00:05:57.621
as we saw in Japan.

00:05:57.645 --> 00:06:00.885
But in this reactor,
if you lose the power to the reactor,

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:04.170
it shuts itself down all by itself,
without human intervention,

00:06:04.194 --> 00:06:06.814
and puts itself in a safe
and controlled configuration.

00:06:06.838 --> 00:06:08.822
Now, this was sounding pretty good to me,

00:06:08.846 --> 00:06:12.260
and I was excited about the potential
of using a liquid fluoride reactor

00:06:12.284 --> 00:06:13.609
to power a lunar community.

00:06:13.633 --> 00:06:16.662
But then I learned about thorium,
and the story got even better.

00:06:16.686 --> 00:06:18.809
Thorium is a naturally
occurring nuclear fuel

00:06:18.833 --> 00:06:21.898
that is four times more common
in the Earth's crust than uranium.

00:06:21.922 --> 00:06:24.351
It can be used in liquid fluoride
thorium reactors

00:06:24.375 --> 00:06:27.958
to produce electrical energy, heat
and other valuable products.

00:06:27.982 --> 00:06:31.730
It's so energy-dense that you could hold
a lifetime supply of thorium energy

00:06:31.754 --> 00:06:32.996
in the palm of your hand.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.568
Thorium is also common on the Moon
and easy to find.

00:06:35.592 --> 00:06:38.647
Here's an actual map of where
the lunar thorium is located.

00:06:38.671 --> 00:06:41.887
Thorium has an electromagnetic signature
that makes it easy to find,

00:06:41.911 --> 00:06:43.072
even from a spacecraft.

00:06:43.096 --> 00:06:46.189
With the energy generated
from a liquid fluoride thorium reactor,

00:06:46.213 --> 00:06:48.904
we could recycle all of the air,
water and waste products

00:06:48.928 --> 00:06:50.234
within the lunar community.

00:06:50.258 --> 00:06:53.229
In fact, doing so would be
an absolute requirement for success.

00:06:53.253 --> 00:06:56.467
We could grow the crops needed
to feed the members of the community

00:06:56.491 --> 00:06:58.313
even during the two-week lunar night,

00:06:58.337 --> 00:07:00.254
using light and power from the reactor.

00:07:00.278 --> 00:07:03.130
It seemed like the liquid fluoride
thorium reactor, or LFTR,

00:07:03.154 --> 00:07:06.623
could be the power source that could make
a self-sustainable lunar colony

00:07:06.647 --> 00:07:07.806
a reality.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.180
But I had a simple question:

00:07:09.204 --> 00:07:11.899
If it was such a great thing
for a community on the Moon,

00:07:11.923 --> 00:07:14.733
why not a community on the Earth,
a community of the future,

00:07:14.757 --> 00:07:16.779
self-sustaining and energy-independent?

00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:19.968
The same energy generation
and recycling techniques

00:07:19.992 --> 00:07:23.038
that could have a powerful impact
on surviving on the Moon

00:07:23.062 --> 00:07:26.112
could also have a powerful impact
on surviving on the Earth.

00:07:26.136 --> 00:07:27.934
Right now, we're burning fossil fuels

00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.258
because they're easy to find
and because we can.

00:07:30.282 --> 00:07:33.999
Unfortunately, they're making some parts
of our planet look like the Moon.

00:07:34.023 --> 00:07:36.409
Using fossil fuels
entangles us in conflict

00:07:36.433 --> 00:07:38.041
in unstable regions of the world

00:07:38.065 --> 00:07:39.978
and costs money and lives.

00:07:40.002 --> 00:07:42.636
Things could be very different
if we were using thorium.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.119
You see, in a LFTR, we could use thorium
about 200 times more efficiently

00:07:46.143 --> 00:07:47.584
than we're using uranium now.

00:07:47.608 --> 00:07:50.642
And because the LFTR is capable
of almost completely releasing

00:07:50.666 --> 00:07:51.828
the energy in thorium,

00:07:51.852 --> 00:07:55.946
this reduces the waste generated
over uranium by factors of hundreds,

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.580
and by factors of millions
over fossil fuels.

00:07:58.604 --> 00:08:01.751
We're still going to need liquid fuels
for vehicles and machinery,

00:08:01.775 --> 00:08:05.659
but we could generate these liquid fuels
from the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

00:08:05.683 --> 00:08:07.512
and from water, much like nature does.

00:08:07.536 --> 00:08:09.673
We could generate hydrogen
by splitting water

00:08:09.697 --> 00:08:13.156
and combining it with carbon
harvested from CO2 in the atmosphere,

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.712
making fuels like methanol,
ammonia, and dimethyl ether,

00:08:16.736 --> 00:08:19.271
which could be a direct replacement
for diesel fuels.

00:08:19.295 --> 00:08:22.455
Imagine carbon-neutral
gasoline and diesel,

00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:24.922
sustainable and self-produced.

00:08:24.946 --> 00:08:26.301
Do we have enough thorium?

00:08:26.325 --> 00:08:27.480
Yes, we do.

00:08:27.504 --> 00:08:31.467
In fact, in the United States, we have
over 3,200 metric tons of thorium

00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:33.267
that was stockpiled 50 years ago

00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:35.838
and is currently buried
in a shallow trench in Nevada.

00:08:35.862 --> 00:08:38.103
This thorium, if used in LFTRs,

00:08:38.127 --> 00:08:41.766
could produce almost as much energy
as the United States uses in three years.

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:43.993
And thorium is not
a rare substance, either.

00:08:44.017 --> 00:08:46.116
There are many sites
like this one in Idaho,

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:50.023
where an area the size of a football field
would produce enough thorium each year

00:08:50.047 --> 00:08:51.323
to power the entire world.

00:08:51.347 --> 00:08:53.312
Using liquid fluoride thorium technology,

00:08:53.336 --> 00:08:56.234
we could move away from
expensive and difficult aspects

00:08:56.258 --> 00:08:59.097
of current water-cooled, solid-fueled
uranium nuclear power.

00:08:59.121 --> 00:09:02.015
We wouldn't need large,
high-pressure nuclear reactors

00:09:02.039 --> 00:09:04.197
and big containment buildings
that they go in.

00:09:04.221 --> 00:09:06.829
We wouldn't need large,
low-efficiency steam turbines.

00:09:06.853 --> 00:09:08.039
We wouldn't need to have

00:09:08.063 --> 00:09:10.751
as many long-distance power
transmission infrastructure,

00:09:10.775 --> 00:09:13.234
because thorium is
a very portable energy source

00:09:13.258 --> 00:09:15.564
that can be located
near to where it is needed.

00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:18.803
A liquid fluoride thorium reactor
would be a compact facility,

00:09:18.827 --> 00:09:20.769
very energy-efficient and safe,

00:09:20.793 --> 00:09:23.269
that would produce the energy
we need day and night,

00:09:23.293 --> 00:09:25.349
and without respect to weather conditions.

00:09:25.373 --> 00:09:28.347
In 2007, we used
five billion tons of coal,

00:09:28.371 --> 00:09:30.085
31 billion barrels of oil

00:09:30.109 --> 00:09:32.342
and five trillion cubic meters
of natural gas,

00:09:32.366 --> 00:09:35.444
along with 65,000 tons of uranium

00:09:35.468 --> 00:09:37.351
to produce the world's energy.

00:09:37.375 --> 00:09:39.314
With thorium, we could do the same thing

00:09:39.338 --> 00:09:42.574
with 7,000 tons of thorium
that could be mined at a single site.

00:09:42.598 --> 00:09:46.134
If all this sounds interesting to you,
I invite you to visit our website,

00:09:46.158 --> 00:09:49.444
where a growing and enthusiastic
online community of thorium advocates

00:09:49.468 --> 00:09:53.152
is working to tell the world
about how we can realize a clean, safe

00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:54.920
and sustainable energy future,

00:09:54.944 --> 00:09:56.539
based on the energies of thorium.

00:09:56.563 --> 00:09:58.277
Thank you very much.
