00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.857
I recently had an epiphany.

00:00:15.183 --> 00:00:19.000
I realized that I could
actually play a role

00:00:19.024 --> 00:00:24.696
in solving one of the biggest problems
that faces mankind today,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.029
and that is the problem of climate change.

00:00:28.497 --> 00:00:32.601
It also dawned on me that
I had been working for 30 years or more

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:34.546
just to get to this point in my life

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.461
where I could actually make
this contribution to a bigger problem.

00:00:38.857 --> 00:00:41.070
And every experiment
that I have done in my lab

00:00:41.094 --> 00:00:43.087
over the last 30 years

00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:47.299
and people who work for me
did in my lab over the last 30 years

00:00:47.323 --> 00:00:51.577
has been directed toward doing
the really big experiment,

00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:53.534
this one last big experiment.

00:00:53.871 --> 00:00:55.022
So who am I?

00:00:55.046 --> 00:00:57.149
I'm a plant geneticist.

00:00:57.173 --> 00:01:01.410
I live in a world where there's
too much CO2 in the atmosphere

00:01:01.434 --> 00:01:04.998
because of human activity.

00:01:05.022 --> 00:01:08.466
But I've come to appreciate the plants

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.622
as amazing machines that they are,

00:01:11.646 --> 00:01:14.600
whose job has been, really,
to just suck up CO2.

00:01:14.624 --> 00:01:15.860
And they do it so well,

00:01:15.884 --> 00:01:20.163
because they've been doing it
for over 500 million years.

00:01:20.187 --> 00:01:22.409
And they're really good at it.

00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:23.583
And so ...

00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:28.242
I also have some urgency
I want to tell you about.

00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:32.208
As a mother, I want to give
my two children a better world

00:01:32.232 --> 00:01:33.895
than I inherited from my parents,

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:36.641
it would be nicer to keep it going
in the right direction,

00:01:36.665 --> 00:01:38.228
not the bad direction.

00:01:38.252 --> 00:01:39.759
But I also ...

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:43.974
I've had Parkinson's
for the last 15 years,

00:01:43.998 --> 00:01:47.362
and this gives me a sense of urgency
that I want to do this now,

00:01:47.386 --> 00:01:50.974
while I feel good enough
to really be part of this team.

00:01:50.998 --> 00:01:53.213
And I have an incredible team.

00:01:53.237 --> 00:01:55.512
We all work together,

00:01:55.536 --> 00:01:59.403
and this is something we want to do
because we have fun.

00:01:59.427 --> 00:02:02.829
And if you're only going to have
five people trying to save the planet,

00:02:02.853 --> 00:02:04.156
you better like each other,

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.952
because you're going to be spending
a lot of time together.

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:08.026
(Laughter)

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.655
OK, alright. But enough about me.

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.362
Let's talk about CO2.

00:02:11.386 --> 00:02:13.489
CO2 is the star of my talk.

00:02:13.998 --> 00:02:18.299
Now, most of you probably think
of CO2 as a pollutant.

00:02:18.323 --> 00:02:23.102
Or perhaps you think of CO2
as the villain in the novel, you know?

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:25.690
It's always the dark side of CO2.

00:02:26.174 --> 00:02:30.974
But as a plant biologist,
I see the other side of CO2, actually.

00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:34.180
And that CO2 that we see,

00:02:34.204 --> 00:02:38.864
we see it differently because
I think we remember, as plant biologists,

00:02:38.888 --> 00:02:40.728
something you may have forgotten.

00:02:40.752 --> 00:02:45.608
And that is that plants actually
do this process called photosynthesis.

00:02:45.632 --> 00:02:47.672
And when they do photosynthesis --

00:02:47.696 --> 00:02:51.434
all carbon-based life on our earth

00:02:51.458 --> 00:02:56.903
is all because of the CO2 that plants
and other photosynthetic microbes

00:02:56.927 --> 00:03:01.317
have dragged in from CO2
that was in the atmosphere.

00:03:01.341 --> 00:03:04.929
And almost all of the carbon in your body
came from air, basically.

00:03:04.953 --> 00:03:06.445
So you come from air,

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:08.175
and it's because of photosynthesis,

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:11.791
because what plants do
is they use the energy in sunlight,

00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:14.680
take that CO2 and fix it into sugars.

00:03:15.046 --> 00:03:16.360
It's a great thing.

00:03:16.384 --> 00:03:18.463
And the other thing
that is really important

00:03:18.487 --> 00:03:20.217
for what I'm going to tell you today

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:23.791
is that plants and other
photosynthetic microbes

00:03:23.815 --> 00:03:26.458
have a great capacity for doing this --

00:03:26.482 --> 00:03:30.789
twentyfold or more than the amount
of CO2 that we put up

00:03:30.813 --> 00:03:32.979
because of our human activities.

00:03:33.003 --> 00:03:36.003
And so, even though
we're not doing a great job

00:03:36.027 --> 00:03:38.347
at cutting our emissions and things,

00:03:38.371 --> 00:03:42.156
plants have the capacity,

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.156
as photosynthetic organisms, to help out.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.301
So we're hoping that's what they'll do.

00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:50.511
But there's a catch here.

00:03:50.535 --> 00:03:52.773
We have to help the plants
a little ourselves,

00:03:52.797 --> 00:03:57.744
because what plants like to do
is put most of the CO2 into sugars.

00:03:57.768 --> 00:04:00.315
And when the end
of the growing season comes,

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:02.696
the plant dies and decomposes,

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.593
and then all that work they did
to suck out the CO2 from the atmosphere

00:04:07.617 --> 00:04:10.847
and make carbon-based biomass

00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:15.340
is now basically going right back up
in the atmosphere as CO2.

00:04:15.364 --> 00:04:21.737
So how can we get plants to redistribute
the CO2 they bring in

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:24.172
into something that's
a little more stable?

00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:27.839
And so it turns out
that plants make this product,

00:04:27.863 --> 00:04:29.485
and it's called suberin.

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.822
This is a natural product
that is in all plant roots.

00:04:32.846 --> 00:04:34.491
And suberin is really cool,

00:04:34.515 --> 00:04:37.212
because as you can see there, I hope,

00:04:37.236 --> 00:04:40.755
everywhere you see a black dot,
that's a carbon.

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:42.843
There's hundreds of them in this molecule.

00:04:42.867 --> 00:04:45.263
And where you see those few red dots,

00:04:45.287 --> 00:04:46.443
those are oxygens.

00:04:46.467 --> 00:04:48.882
And oxygen is what microbes like to find

00:04:48.906 --> 00:04:51.236
so they can decompose a plant.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.910
So you can see why this is
a perfect carbon storage device.

00:04:54.934 --> 00:05:00.047
And actually it can stabilize
the carbon that gets fixed by the plant

00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:03.954
into something that's a little bit
better for the plant.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.586
And so, why now?

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.180
Why is now a good time to do
a biological solution to this problem?

00:05:12.204 --> 00:05:16.297
It's because over the last
30 or so years --

00:05:16.321 --> 00:05:19.339
and I know that's a long time,
you're saying, "Why now?" --

00:05:19.363 --> 00:05:21.653
but 30 years ago, we began to understand

00:05:21.677 --> 00:05:25.283
the functions of all the genes
that are in an organism in general.

00:05:25.307 --> 00:05:28.895
And that included humans as well as plants

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.743
and many other complicated eukaryotes.

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:35.196
And so, what did the 1980s begin?

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.403
What began then is that we now know

00:05:37.427 --> 00:05:39.954
the function of many of the genes
that are in a plant

00:05:39.978 --> 00:05:41.403
that tell a plant to grow.

00:05:41.427 --> 00:05:46.133
And that has now converged
with the fact that we can do genomics

00:05:46.157 --> 00:05:49.283
in a faster and cheaper way
than we ever did before.

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:53.307
And what that tells us is that
all life on earth is really related,

00:05:53.331 --> 00:05:58.728
but plants are more related to each other
than other organisms.

00:05:58.752 --> 00:06:02.006
And that you can take a trait
that you know from one plant

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.237
and put it in another plant,

00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:07.756
and you can make a prediction
that it'll do the same thing.

00:06:08.093 --> 00:06:09.649
And so that's important as well.

00:06:09.673 --> 00:06:13.106
Then finally, we have these little
genetic tricks that came along,

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.903
like you heard about this morning --

00:06:15.927 --> 00:06:18.186
things like CRISPR,
that allows us to do editing

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.713
and make genes be a little different
from the normal state in the plant.

00:06:23.272 --> 00:06:25.458
OK, so now we have biology on our side.

00:06:25.482 --> 00:06:29.236
I'm a biologist, so that's why
I'm proposing a solution

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.141
to the climate change problem

00:06:32.165 --> 00:06:37.522
that really involves the best evolved
organism on earth to do it -- plants.

00:06:37.546 --> 00:06:39.267
So how are we going to do it?

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.263
Biology comes to the rescue.

00:06:41.287 --> 00:06:42.490
Here we go.

00:06:43.204 --> 00:06:44.354
OK.

00:06:45.634 --> 00:06:49.786
You have to remember
three simple things from my talk, OK?

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:54.125
We have to get plants to make more suberin
than they normally make,

00:06:54.149 --> 00:06:57.106
because we need them to be
a little better than what they are.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.498
We have to get them to make more roots,

00:07:01.522 --> 00:07:04.260
because if we make more roots,
we can make more suberin --

00:07:04.284 --> 00:07:09.037
now we have more of the cells
that suberin likes to accumulate in.

00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:12.490
And then the third thing is,
we want the plants to have deeper roots.

00:07:12.514 --> 00:07:14.236
And what that does is --

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.927
we're asking the plant, actually,
"OK, make stable carbon,

00:07:17.951 --> 00:07:19.395
more than you used to,

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:21.744
and then bury it for us in the ground."

00:07:21.768 --> 00:07:24.213
So they can do that
if they make roots that go deep

00:07:24.237 --> 00:07:27.847
rather than meander around
on the surface of the soil.

00:07:27.871 --> 00:07:30.559
Those are the three traits
we want to change:

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:35.490
more suberin, more roots,
and the last one, deep roots.

00:07:35.514 --> 00:07:38.268
Then we want to combine
all those traits in one plant,

00:07:38.292 --> 00:07:41.276
and we can do that easily
and we will do it,

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.752
and we are doing it actually,
in the model plant, Arabidopsis,

00:07:45.776 --> 00:07:48.650
which allows us to do these
experiments much faster

00:07:48.674 --> 00:07:51.958
than we can do in another big plant.

00:07:51.982 --> 00:07:55.728
And when we find that we have plants
where traits all add up

00:07:55.752 --> 00:07:58.863
and we can get more of them,
more suberin in those plants,

00:07:58.887 --> 00:08:00.275
we're going to move it all --

00:08:00.299 --> 00:08:02.882
we can and we we will,
we're beginning to do this --

00:08:02.906 --> 00:08:04.505
move it to crop plants.

00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:09.244
And I'll tell you why we're picking
crop plants to do the work for us

00:08:09.268 --> 00:08:11.653
when I get to that part of my talk.

00:08:12.188 --> 00:08:16.117
OK, so I think this is the science
behind the whole thing.

00:08:16.141 --> 00:08:20.085
And so I know we can do the science,
I feel pretty confident about that.

00:08:20.109 --> 00:08:22.410
And the reason is because,
just in the last year,

00:08:22.434 --> 00:08:26.777
we've been able to find single genes
that affect each of those three traits.

00:08:27.307 --> 00:08:31.315
And in several of those cases,
two out of the three,

00:08:31.339 --> 00:08:33.720
we have more than one way to get there.

00:08:33.744 --> 00:08:37.156
So that tells us we might be able
to even combine within a trait

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.913
and get even more suberin.

00:08:41.735 --> 00:08:43.156
This shows one result,

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.046
where we have a plant here on the right

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.820
that's making more than double
the amount of root

00:08:47.844 --> 00:08:49.175
than the plant on the left,

00:08:49.199 --> 00:08:51.892
and that's just because of the way
we expressed one gene

00:08:51.916 --> 00:08:53.370
that's normally in the plant

00:08:53.394 --> 00:08:57.887
in a slightly different way
than the plant usually does on its own.

00:08:57.911 --> 00:09:00.871
Alright, so that's just one example
I wanted to show you.

00:09:00.895 --> 00:09:02.966
And now I want to tell you that, you know,

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.248
we still have a lot
of challenges, actually,

00:09:05.272 --> 00:09:06.998
when we get to this problem,

00:09:07.022 --> 00:09:09.307
because it takes ...

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.993
We have to get the farmers
to actually buy the seeds,

00:09:13.017 --> 00:09:15.469
or at least the seed company to buy seeds

00:09:15.493 --> 00:09:17.730
that farmers are going to want to have.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.485
And so when we do the experiments,

00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:24.212
we can't actually take a loss in yield,

00:09:24.236 --> 00:09:27.228
because while we are doing
these experiments,

00:09:27.252 --> 00:09:29.974
say, beginning about 10 years from now,

00:09:29.998 --> 00:09:33.184
the earth's population will be
even more than it is right now.

00:09:33.208 --> 00:09:35.752
And it's rapidly growing still.

00:09:35.776 --> 00:09:38.430
So by the end of the century,
we have 11 billion people,

00:09:38.454 --> 00:09:42.742
we have wasted ecosystems that aren't
really going to be able to handle

00:09:42.766 --> 00:09:46.192
all the load they have to take
from agriculture.

00:09:46.567 --> 00:09:50.853
And then we also have
this competition for land.

00:09:51.209 --> 00:09:56.450
And so we figure, to do this
carbon sequestration experiment

00:09:56.474 --> 00:10:00.791
actually requires a fair amount of land.

00:10:00.815 --> 00:10:03.355
We can't take it away from food,

00:10:03.379 --> 00:10:06.895
because we have to feed the people
that are also going to be on the earth

00:10:06.919 --> 00:10:09.459
until we get past this big crisis.

00:10:09.483 --> 00:10:13.816
And the climate change is actually
causing loss of yield all over the earth.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.903
So why would farmers
want to buy seeds

00:10:16.927 --> 00:10:18.379
if it's going to impact yield?

00:10:18.403 --> 00:10:20.434
So we're not going to let it impact yield,

00:10:20.458 --> 00:10:22.657
we're going to always have
checks and balances

00:10:22.681 --> 00:10:25.871
that says go or no go on that experiment.

00:10:25.895 --> 00:10:29.964
And then the second thing is,
when a plant actually makes more carbon

00:10:29.988 --> 00:10:31.855
and buries it in the soil like that,

00:10:31.879 --> 00:10:35.434
almost all the soils on earth
are actually depleted of carbon

00:10:35.458 --> 00:10:38.181
because of the load from agriculture,

00:10:38.205 --> 00:10:40.681
trying to feed eight billion people,

00:10:40.705 --> 00:10:43.001
which is what lives
on the earth right now.

00:10:43.372 --> 00:10:45.919
And so, that is also a problem as well.

00:10:48.212 --> 00:10:51.705
Plants that are making more carbon,
those soils become enriched in carbon.

00:10:51.729 --> 00:10:56.364
And carbon-enriched soils
actually hold nitrogen

00:10:56.388 --> 00:10:58.640
and they hold sulphur
and they hold phosphate --

00:10:58.664 --> 00:11:02.260
all the minerals that are required
for plants to grow and have a good yield.

00:11:02.284 --> 00:11:05.236
And they also retain water
in the soil as well.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.610
So the suberin will break up
into little particles

00:11:07.634 --> 00:11:10.156
and give the whole soil a new texture.

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.887
And as we've shown that
we can get more carbon in that soil,

00:11:13.911 --> 00:11:15.847
the soil will get darker.

00:11:15.871 --> 00:11:18.926
And so we will be able
to measure all that,

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.990
and hopefully, this is going to help
us solve the problem.

00:11:22.363 --> 00:11:23.799
So, OK.

00:11:23.823 --> 00:11:27.728
So we have the challenges of
a lot of land that we need to use,

00:11:27.752 --> 00:11:29.375
we have to get farmers to buy it,

00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:32.014
and that's going to be
the hard thing for us, I think,

00:11:32.038 --> 00:11:34.936
because we're not really salesmen,

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.974
we're people who like to Google a person
rather than meet them,

00:11:37.998 --> 00:11:39.264
you know what I mean?

00:11:39.288 --> 00:11:40.300
(Laughter)

00:11:40.324 --> 00:11:42.811
That's what scientists are mostly like.

00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:46.943
But we know now that, you know,
no one can really deny --

00:11:46.967 --> 00:11:50.156
the climate is changing,
everyone knows that.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.276
And it's here and it's bad
and it's serious,

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.149
and we need to do something about it.

00:11:54.173 --> 00:11:57.220
But I feel pretty optimistic
that we can do this.

00:11:57.244 --> 00:12:01.514
So I'm here today
as a character witness for plants.

00:12:01.538 --> 00:12:04.459
And I want to tell you
that plants are going to do it for us,

00:12:04.483 --> 00:12:06.666
all we have to do
is give them a little help,

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.211
and they will go and get
a gold medal for humanity.

00:12:09.235 --> 00:12:10.647
Thank you very much.

00:12:10.671 --> 00:12:14.658
(Applause)

00:12:14.682 --> 00:12:16.618
(Cheers)

00:12:16.642 --> 00:12:17.793
Thank you.

00:12:17.817 --> 00:12:22.653
(Applause)

00:12:25.428 --> 00:12:26.828
I finally got it out.

00:12:30.817 --> 00:12:32.150
Chris Anderson: Wow.

00:12:32.831 --> 00:12:34.410
Joanne, you're so extraordinary.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.529
Just to be sure we heard this right:

00:12:36.553 --> 00:12:39.791
you believe that within the next 10 years

00:12:39.815 --> 00:12:42.082
you may be able to offer the world

00:12:43.895 --> 00:12:48.909
seed variants for the major crops,
like -- what? -- wheat, corn, maybe rice,

00:12:50.331 --> 00:12:53.768
that can offer farmers just as much yield,

00:12:53.792 --> 00:12:58.811
sequester three times, four times,
more carbon than they currently do?

00:12:59.315 --> 00:13:00.466
Even more than that?

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.765
Joanne Chory: We don't know
that number, really.

00:13:02.789 --> 00:13:04.363
But they will do more.

00:13:04.387 --> 00:13:05.769
CA: And at the same time,

00:13:05.793 --> 00:13:09.211
make the soil that those
farmers have more fertile?

00:13:09.235 --> 00:13:10.385
JC: Yes, right.

00:13:10.903 --> 00:13:12.680
CA: So that is astonishing.

00:13:12.704 --> 00:13:16.609
And the genius of doing that
and a solution that can scale

00:13:16.633 --> 00:13:18.037
where there's already scale.

00:13:18.061 --> 00:13:19.752
JC: Yes, thank you for saying that.

00:13:19.776 --> 00:13:21.760
CA: No, no, you said it, you said it.

00:13:21.784 --> 00:13:25.272
But it almost seems too good to be true.

00:13:25.919 --> 00:13:30.216
Your Audacious Project is that we scale up
the research in your lab

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.299
and pave the way to start
some of these pilots

00:13:34.323 --> 00:13:36.561
and make this incredible vision possible.

00:13:36.585 --> 00:13:38.387
JC: That's right, yes, thank you.

00:13:38.411 --> 00:13:40.190
CA: Joanne Chory, thank you so much.

00:13:40.214 --> 00:13:41.415
Godspeed.

00:13:41.439 --> 00:13:44.301
(Applause)

00:13:44.325 --> 00:13:45.475
JC: Thank you.
