00:00:13.127 --> 00:00:15.293
Most of you will know

00:00:15.317 --> 00:00:19.888
about the challenges faced
by my beloved continent, Africa.

00:00:20.635 --> 00:00:22.809
Too many people are poor.

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:26.061
Millions of girls
don't have access to school.

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:30.299
And there aren't enough jobs
for the rapidly growing population.

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:32.671
Every day,

00:00:32.695 --> 00:00:37.395
33,000 new young people
join the search for employment.

00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:41.076
That's 12 million
for three million formal jobs.

00:00:41.482 --> 00:00:42.958
In sub-Saharan Africa,

00:00:42.982 --> 00:00:48.506
less than one in four young people
are likely to get waged or salaried work.

00:00:49.022 --> 00:00:51.379
The chances of making a secure living

00:00:51.403 --> 00:00:55.116
are even slimmer
for poor and rural young women.

00:00:55.506 --> 00:00:57.672
They cannot afford an education.

00:00:57.696 --> 00:01:02.743
And they do not have the same access
to wages, loans or land

00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:04.053
as men.

00:01:04.077 --> 00:01:06.763
This leaves entire communities trapped

00:01:06.787 --> 00:01:11.454
in a vicious cycle of poverty,
inequality and hopelessness.

00:01:11.922 --> 00:01:15.716
But I'm not here
to narrate the doom and gloom,

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.553
because we also know
that a youthful population

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:22.268
presents an opportunity
to kick-start economic growth

00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:24.307
and solve global challenges.

00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:25.482
And in fact,

00:01:25.506 --> 00:01:30.855
there is a growing movement in Africa,
of educated young women,

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:34.765
who are stepping up and using
the power of their network

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.440
and a tool we call social interest

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:39.122
to uplift communities.

00:01:39.804 --> 00:01:44.145
I'm one of the leaders
of the organization behind this movement.

00:01:44.693 --> 00:01:48.248
An organization that also
supported me through school.

00:01:48.648 --> 00:01:54.283
And I have seen social interest
multiply the impact of our work.

00:01:55.363 --> 00:02:00.116
Social interest is a way
to pay back interest on a loan

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.648
through service, rather than dollars.

00:02:02.672 --> 00:02:05.235
Sharing time and knowledge
through mentoring,

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.918
academic support,

00:02:06.942 --> 00:02:09.366
business training to others in need.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.311
This means the impact of a loan
is felt not by one, but by many.

00:02:16.072 --> 00:02:17.224
Through this system,

00:02:17.248 --> 00:02:21.519
we've been able to help
and send more and more girls to school,

00:02:21.543 --> 00:02:23.700
support them while they are there,

00:02:23.724 --> 00:02:25.184
help them start businesses

00:02:25.208 --> 00:02:28.454
and ultimately,
lead in their communities --

00:02:28.478 --> 00:02:32.172
all while providing funding
for the next generation.

00:02:32.657 --> 00:02:34.990
Social interest can be used

00:02:35.014 --> 00:02:39.988
to supercharge any movement
where the benefits can be paid forward.

00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:41.926
Let me give you an example.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.895
This is Stumai from rural Tanzania.

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:48.768
She tragically lost her father
when she was just three years old.

00:02:48.792 --> 00:02:52.844
Leaving a disabled mother
to single-handedly raise her

00:02:52.868 --> 00:02:54.505
and her five siblings.

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:56.474
Once Stumai completed primary school,

00:02:56.498 --> 00:02:58.426
she was about to drop out of school

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.728
and become one of the 92 percent
of girls in sub-Saharan Africa

00:03:03.752 --> 00:03:05.656
that never finish high school.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.585
Instead, she got lucky.

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.918
She got support from a nonprofit
that paid her fees

00:03:10.942 --> 00:03:12.641
and kept her in school.

00:03:12.665 --> 00:03:14.577
But upon graduating high school,

00:03:14.601 --> 00:03:18.394
she faced a daunting challenge
of what's next.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.391
She knew she had to start
her own business to survive.

00:03:22.415 --> 00:03:23.845
And to help her mother,

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:26.851
who had tried so hard
to keep her in school

00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:28.934
by selling her only assets,

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:32.395
a stack of corrugated iron sheets
she had been saving

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.555
in the hope of building
a better home for her children.

00:03:35.974 --> 00:03:39.815
Stumai also knew she wouldnâ€™t get a loan
from a traditional bank,

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:43.315
which generally considers
young, rural women like her,

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:46.564
without land or assets, unbankable.

00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:49.498
Through a special group
of lending partners,

00:03:49.522 --> 00:03:53.592
she secured 350 dollars
to start a food shop,

00:03:53.616 --> 00:03:58.609
selling vegetables, oil, rice,
tomatoes, onions and beans.

00:03:58.633 --> 00:04:02.307
Fellow network members helped
to train her on basic business skills,

00:04:02.331 --> 00:04:04.418
like creating a business plan,

00:04:04.442 --> 00:04:06.950
working out profits, marketing,

00:04:06.974 --> 00:04:08.291
keeping business records

00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:09.982
and the value of savings.

00:04:10.395 --> 00:04:12.172
And the business took off.

00:04:12.482 --> 00:04:15.997
She repaid the original loan
within eight months,

00:04:16.021 --> 00:04:18.449
and then borrowed 2,000 dollars

00:04:18.473 --> 00:04:22.429
to start a motorcycle taxi
and courier business.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.990
Stumai now owns two motorcycles

00:04:26.014 --> 00:04:28.672
and employs two people.

00:04:28.696 --> 00:04:32.379
And she has been able
to purchase land and build a house,

00:04:32.403 --> 00:04:34.434
and the business continues to grow

00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:36.661
from strength to strength.

00:04:37.403 --> 00:04:41.664
Stumai repaid her interest
in social interest.

00:04:42.173 --> 00:04:43.855
She paid social interest

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:47.569
by providing mentoring
to girls in a local high school.

00:04:48.466 --> 00:04:51.878
She volunteered weekly as a learner guide,

00:04:51.902 --> 00:04:54.998
delivering a life skills
and well-being curriculum

00:04:55.022 --> 00:04:59.109
that helps children gain
the confidence to ask questions,

00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:01.085
care for and support each other,

00:05:01.109 --> 00:05:03.339
learn about health and nutrition,

00:05:03.363 --> 00:05:05.738
set goals and learn how to achieve them.

00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:12.096
Stumai says her greatest reward
is witnessing the girls she mentors

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.040
start to believe in themselves
and succeeding.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.664
These days, Stumai also trains
other learner guides.

00:05:19.109 --> 00:05:23.069
That's multiplying the number of girls
making it through school

00:05:23.093 --> 00:05:25.902
and into secure livelihoods like she did.

00:05:26.784 --> 00:05:30.268
Through her business profits,
she has been able to support her siblings,

00:05:30.292 --> 00:05:33.633
three nieces and nephews
and other children in her community

00:05:33.657 --> 00:05:34.855
to go to school.

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:38.141
She also regularly supports
other network members.

00:05:38.165 --> 00:05:39.498
For example,

00:05:39.522 --> 00:05:43.339
a young woman studying for a diploma
in community development.

00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:45.522
In the past two years,

00:05:45.546 --> 00:05:48.609
Stumai helped her with money for bus fare,

00:05:48.633 --> 00:05:50.839
for sanitary pads, for soap

00:05:50.863 --> 00:05:53.188
and encouraged her to keep going.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.966
Stumai spends 370 dollars a year
supporting the education of others.

00:06:01.831 --> 00:06:08.093
That's 17 percent of her gross earnings
from her motorcycle business.

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:12.204
This is the power of social interest.

00:06:12.688 --> 00:06:17.656
Stumai's example shows
that if you help one girl,

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.458
not only to go to school,

00:06:19.482 --> 00:06:21.776
but graduate and start a business,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.879
she can in turn make a giant difference

00:06:24.903 --> 00:06:27.701
in the lives of others and her community.

00:06:28.047 --> 00:06:32.134
Had Stumai paid back interest
on her loan in dollars,

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:36.357
her success might have been felt by her
and her immediate family,

00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:39.658
but because she paid interest
as social interest,

00:06:39.682 --> 00:06:42.753
the impact was felt by her mentees,

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:45.388
her nieces, nephews, her employees

00:06:45.412 --> 00:06:47.816
and so many others around her.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.497
Stumai is just one example of many.

00:06:52.235 --> 00:06:57.228
Today, we have 7,000
learner guides like Stumai,

00:06:57.252 --> 00:06:59.166
working across Malawi,

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.619
Tanzania, Ghana, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

00:07:02.643 --> 00:07:04.222
And collectively,

00:07:04.246 --> 00:07:07.043
they've helped children
do better in school.

00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:12.168
The girls we work with
are nearly three times less likely

00:07:12.192 --> 00:07:13.525
to drop out of school,

00:07:13.549 --> 00:07:17.328
because learner guides make home visits
when girls fail to attend school

00:07:17.352 --> 00:07:19.065
to help them back on track.

00:07:19.089 --> 00:07:22.698
They also work with communities
and district governments

00:07:22.722 --> 00:07:25.794
to address the challenges children face,

00:07:25.818 --> 00:07:29.532
including preventing
or annulling child marriages,

00:07:29.556 --> 00:07:33.020
connecting children facing hunger
or hardship at home

00:07:33.044 --> 00:07:34.472
with local support,

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:35.726
or running study groups

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.361
so that children who might be
lagging behind in their studies

00:07:39.385 --> 00:07:41.369
can get supporters and catch up.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:46.520
They act as trusted sisters,
friends and guardians.

00:07:47.299 --> 00:07:51.679
So far, nearly 6,300 network members

00:07:51.703 --> 00:07:54.870
have borrowed close
to three million dollars,

00:07:55.204 --> 00:08:02.091
with a repayment rate of those loans
at consistently above 95 percent.

00:08:03.196 --> 00:08:05.190
And our 140,000 members,

00:08:06.466 --> 00:08:09.664
they have invested their own resources

00:08:09.688 --> 00:08:11.514
to support and send

00:08:11.538 --> 00:08:16.704
over 937,000 children
to primary and secondary school.

00:08:17.744 --> 00:08:19.847
Every young woman we work with

00:08:19.871 --> 00:08:23.204
supports, on average,
another three children

00:08:23.228 --> 00:08:25.649
outside of her immediate family

00:08:25.673 --> 00:08:26.879
to go to school.

00:08:26.903 --> 00:08:30.148
All without additional money from us.

00:08:30.911 --> 00:08:34.464
We are building a powerful force.

00:08:34.488 --> 00:08:37.027
Gaining ever greater momentum

00:08:37.051 --> 00:08:40.417
as we open the door
for more and more girls

00:08:40.441 --> 00:08:41.606
to go to school,

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:45.593
succeed, lead and in turn,
support thousands more.

00:08:46.408 --> 00:08:47.571
This system,

00:08:47.595 --> 00:08:51.376
supporting those once excluded
to transform their lives

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.265
and then step up for others,

00:08:53.289 --> 00:08:55.956
can work for more than girls' education.

00:08:56.548 --> 00:09:00.104
Of course, you need to get
your money back if you lend it.

00:09:00.548 --> 00:09:04.341
But instead of demanding
interest in dollars,

00:09:04.365 --> 00:09:07.076
can you consider using
social interest instead?

00:09:07.874 --> 00:09:09.739
For example,

00:09:09.763 --> 00:09:11.588
could young people

00:09:11.612 --> 00:09:14.889
pass on the skills they learned
in training colleges?

00:09:15.517 --> 00:09:17.188
Like Michelle,

00:09:17.212 --> 00:09:19.815
who teaches brickmaking
in rural Zimbabwe.

00:09:20.173 --> 00:09:21.323
Or Louisa,

00:09:21.347 --> 00:09:24.426
who is training others
on climate-smart agriculture

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:25.730
in Malawi.

00:09:25.754 --> 00:09:27.420
Or Fatima in Ghana,

00:09:27.444 --> 00:09:30.246
who is training women
to help deliver babies

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.040
where expectant mothers

00:09:32.064 --> 00:09:35.407
might not be able to make it
to the local hospital on time.

00:09:36.338 --> 00:09:37.839
When I was growing up,

00:09:37.863 --> 00:09:40.974
an elder in my village in rural Zimbabwe

00:09:40.998 --> 00:09:44.394
once described the challenges I faced
in going to school.

00:09:44.815 --> 00:09:45.965
She said,

00:09:47.521 --> 00:09:50.558
"Those who harvest many pumpkins

00:09:50.582 --> 00:09:54.388
often do not have the clay pots
to cook them in."

00:09:54.971 --> 00:09:56.458
(Laughter)

00:09:56.482 --> 00:09:58.657
What she meant was that,

00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:05.269
although I got the best possible
results in my exams

00:10:05.293 --> 00:10:07.545
when I finished elementary school,

00:10:07.569 --> 00:10:10.037
my talent was of no value

00:10:10.061 --> 00:10:15.054
if my family could not afford
to pay for me to continue my education.

00:10:15.412 --> 00:10:17.483
Well, with this system,

00:10:17.507 --> 00:10:19.729
we are not just providing pots,

00:10:19.753 --> 00:10:23.404
or making a single meal
out of the pumpkins.

00:10:23.428 --> 00:10:24.958
After all,

00:10:24.982 --> 00:10:27.934
there are hundreds
of seeds in a single pumpkin.

00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:29.887
We are saving the seeds,

00:10:29.911 --> 00:10:31.076
planting them

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.167
and nurturing every one of them.

00:10:34.308 --> 00:10:35.879
And the result?

00:10:36.482 --> 00:10:40.546
A virtuous cycle of prosperity,

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.863
equality and hope,

00:10:42.887 --> 00:10:44.593
led by young women.

00:10:44.617 --> 00:10:46.037
Because together,

00:10:46.061 --> 00:10:48.776
we are shaking up the world.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.649
Pamoja tunaweza --
