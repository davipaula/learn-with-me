00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.944
There is something we desperately need

00:00:15.968 --> 00:00:18.888
that we cannot stop doing:

00:00:18.912 --> 00:00:20.078
it is breathing.

00:00:20.596 --> 00:00:22.210
Do you want to try?

00:00:22.234 --> 00:00:25.002
Why don't we stop breathing together

00:00:25.026 --> 00:00:28.182
for, let's say, even 10 seconds.

00:00:28.206 --> 00:00:29.364
Is that OK?

00:00:29.388 --> 00:00:30.825
Let's do it.

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.421
Get ready ... OK, now!

00:00:51.248 --> 00:00:53.891
Oof, difficult, isn't it?

00:00:54.411 --> 00:00:57.636
Well, this is an incredible number

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.365
that will again take your breath away:

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:02.601
seven.

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:03.943
Seven what?

00:01:03.967 --> 00:01:08.053
Seven million premature deaths a year

00:01:08.077 --> 00:01:13.262
caused by exposure to the bad quality
of the air we breathe.

00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:18.625
Imagine -- it's like more than
the entire population of my dear Madrid

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.888
will be wiped out in one year.

00:01:22.378 --> 00:01:23.620
And you may ask:

00:01:23.644 --> 00:01:26.005
Has this information been disclosed?

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:30.129
Has this information
been publicized, distributed?

00:01:30.153 --> 00:01:31.442
Well, yes.

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:36.605
We have at the moment
more than 70,000 scientific papers

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:41.919
examining the relationship
between air pollution and our health,

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.445
and the global media has been
regularly covering this issue.

00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:50.497
In fact, in a relatively
short period of time,

00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:52.208
we have come to know

00:01:52.232 --> 00:01:56.250
that air pollution is having
a negative impact

00:01:56.274 --> 00:02:00.792
on almost all our major organs.

00:02:01.275 --> 00:02:03.416
Let's start by the lungs.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.917
When we think about air pollution,
we always think about the lungs.

00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:10.561
In fact, every time we take a breath,

00:02:10.585 --> 00:02:14.384
we are inhaling toxic pollutants,

00:02:14.408 --> 00:02:18.704
and our poor pink and lovely lungs

00:02:18.728 --> 00:02:20.584
are suffering all of that.

00:02:22.132 --> 00:02:24.460
Over the last 10 years,

00:02:24.484 --> 00:02:29.006
we have put together a lot of knowledge
about what's happened to that,

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.340
but let me tell you first
what is air pollution.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.895
OK, air pollution
is a very complex mixture

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:40.608
of solid particles,

00:02:40.632 --> 00:02:42.504
liquid droplets

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:44.668
and gaseous chemicals.

00:02:44.692 --> 00:02:46.518
Imagine all of this mixture

00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:52.427
that might come from sources
like household fuel burning

00:02:52.451 --> 00:02:54.626
or industry or traffic

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.777
or many other indoor and outdoor sources.

00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:02.700
And, of course, different
sources of pollution

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:06.822
will make different
mixtures of pollutants.

00:03:07.512 --> 00:03:10.713
The point is that all of these toxins,

00:03:10.737 --> 00:03:13.120
they can be combined in different ways.

00:03:13.144 --> 00:03:17.650
Let's take, for instance,
the particulate matter, the PM.

00:03:17.674 --> 00:03:20.814
It can be a mixture that will include --

00:03:20.838 --> 00:03:22.361
look at the cocktail here --

00:03:22.385 --> 00:03:25.406
soil and road dust,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.175
sea salt,

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:28.848
toxic metals,

00:03:28.872 --> 00:03:31.148
diesel smog,

00:03:31.172 --> 00:03:33.414
nitrates and sulfates,

00:03:33.438 --> 00:03:37.584
and all of this toxic poison,
this delicious cocktail,

00:03:37.608 --> 00:03:41.227
is going through our lungs every day,

00:03:41.251 --> 00:03:44.097
and we are constantly exposed
to this air pollution

00:03:44.121 --> 00:03:46.146
because we cannot stop breathing.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.679
I mean, we can do it for 10 seconds,
but no more than that.

00:03:50.157 --> 00:03:51.780
We cannot stop breathing

00:03:51.804 --> 00:03:53.305
and, in addition,

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:59.752
we need, every day,
around 10,000 liters of air.

00:04:00.688 --> 00:04:03.944
So we said that we have
seven million deaths

00:04:03.968 --> 00:04:06.460
caused by air pollution every year.

00:04:06.484 --> 00:04:08.759
Are we panicking?

00:04:08.783 --> 00:04:10.661
Are we keeping calm?

00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:15.745
Are we declaring a national disaster,
a global emergency?

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.831
Well, no, and in fact I'm asking myself
this question every day:

00:04:20.855 --> 00:04:22.546
What is happening?

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.065
But here is something that maybe
will force us to react more quickly.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.076
Air pollution is not just
affecting our lungs.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.170
It's affecting our brain as well.

00:04:36.194 --> 00:04:37.488
This is our brain.

00:04:38.186 --> 00:04:39.351
Beautiful.

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:40.655
We all have it.

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:42.376
We all need it.

00:04:43.063 --> 00:04:45.580
Hopefully, we all use it --

00:04:45.604 --> 00:04:46.673
(Laughter)

00:04:46.697 --> 00:04:48.369
some more than others.

00:04:48.816 --> 00:04:51.730
And in the last 10 years of history,

00:04:51.754 --> 00:04:55.611
the research about the relationship
between air pollution

00:04:55.635 --> 00:04:57.284
and our brain's health

00:04:57.308 --> 00:04:59.553
has been increased dramatically,

00:04:59.577 --> 00:05:04.102
so maybe now our brain
is going up in smoke.

00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:06.983
But let me tell you the evidence,

00:05:07.007 --> 00:05:10.546
what we know so far
about air pollution in our brain.

00:05:11.107 --> 00:05:15.158
First, there is an emerging
body of evidence

00:05:15.182 --> 00:05:18.400
regarding the potential harmful effects

00:05:18.424 --> 00:05:19.802
of air pollutants

00:05:19.826 --> 00:05:22.671
into our central nervous system.

00:05:22.695 --> 00:05:25.049
But let's go back to the toxic particles.

00:05:25.073 --> 00:05:26.224
Remember?

00:05:26.248 --> 00:05:27.932
We left them at the lungs,

00:05:27.956 --> 00:05:29.264
enjoying life,

00:05:29.288 --> 00:05:30.901
polluting everything.

00:05:30.925 --> 00:05:32.941
But now the smallest of them,

00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:35.943
they can cross into the bloodstream,

00:05:35.967 --> 00:05:39.290
and from the bloodstream,
pumped by the heart,

00:05:39.314 --> 00:05:41.491
they can reach the whole body,

00:05:41.515 --> 00:05:44.110
threatening every organ,

00:05:44.134 --> 00:05:45.826
including the brain.

00:05:46.697 --> 00:05:49.826
We used to say that
air pollution has no borders,

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.522
and it's true as well within our bodies,

00:05:52.546 --> 00:05:57.358
because air pollutants will cross
the placental barrier

00:05:57.382 --> 00:06:03.954
and reach the fetus and alter
the cerebral cortex of our children

00:06:03.978 --> 00:06:08.074
even before they take their first breath.

00:06:09.178 --> 00:06:13.317
Second, several studies have suggested

00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:20.325
that both prenatal and early childhood
long-term exposure to air pollution

00:06:20.837 --> 00:06:26.558
will have a negative influence
on neural development,

00:06:26.582 --> 00:06:30.884
will have lower cognitive test outcomes,

00:06:30.908 --> 00:06:34.230
and there will be an influence as well,
a negative influence,

00:06:34.254 --> 00:06:38.919
on some behavioral disorders like autism

00:06:38.943 --> 00:06:43.529
and attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder.

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:47.371
In addition to that, some evidence found

00:06:47.395 --> 00:06:52.191
that exposing our children's
and young adults' brains

00:06:52.215 --> 00:06:55.032
for a long time to particulate matter

00:06:55.056 --> 00:07:00.342
will cause some reactions
like brain inflammation,

00:07:00.366 --> 00:07:02.918
altering the neural response

00:07:02.942 --> 00:07:09.912
and [also] leading to the influence
of more protein plaques

00:07:09.936 --> 00:07:11.523
that are accumulating,

00:07:11.547 --> 00:07:14.730
and those can increase
the risks for diseases

00:07:14.754 --> 00:07:17.704
like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:19.844
Ironic, isn't it:

00:07:19.868 --> 00:07:24.487
we are investing in our children's future,

00:07:24.511 --> 00:07:28.946
we are sending them to school
every day to expand their minds,

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.939
the society is investing
in their education,

00:07:31.963 --> 00:07:37.394
and yet the air they breathe
while waiting for the school bus

00:07:37.418 --> 00:07:42.356
is influencing negatively
the development of their brain.

00:07:43.334 --> 00:07:46.839
Let's go to the third: What about adults?

00:07:46.863 --> 00:07:50.106
According to recent scientific evidence,

00:07:51.376 --> 00:07:58.346
long-term exposure to particulate matter
will cause a cognitive decline

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.521
in study participants as they age.

00:08:01.545 --> 00:08:02.764
And not only that,

00:08:02.788 --> 00:08:08.160
if you expose them to long-term,
very fine particulate matter,

00:08:08.184 --> 00:08:11.582
their brain will age more rapidly,

00:08:11.606 --> 00:08:14.582
and they will have higher odds

00:08:14.606 --> 00:08:19.499
of having small, silent strokes.

00:08:20.326 --> 00:08:22.865
The last one -- and I will not
give you more evidence,

00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:24.867
because there is a ton of [it] --

00:08:24.891 --> 00:08:28.237
some epidemiological studies
in animal models

00:08:28.261 --> 00:08:33.306
have suggested that there might be
an increased risk of dementia

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.438
with sustained exposure to air pollutants.

00:08:37.703 --> 00:08:42.260
So, almost everybody
is exposed to air pollution.

00:08:43.114 --> 00:08:47.103
Whether you live in a rural area
or an urban area,

00:08:47.127 --> 00:08:51.450
whether you live in a high-income country
or a low-income country,

00:08:51.474 --> 00:08:54.779
everybody's brains, including yours,

00:08:54.803 --> 00:08:56.152
are at risk.

00:08:56.659 --> 00:08:58.379
As a medical doctor,

00:08:58.403 --> 00:09:03.418
I have been dedicating
the last more than 20 years now

00:09:03.442 --> 00:09:05.208
of my professional life

00:09:05.232 --> 00:09:09.343
to raise awareness about
public health issues,

00:09:09.367 --> 00:09:10.804
public health risks,

00:09:10.828 --> 00:09:12.482
at the World Health Organization,

00:09:12.506 --> 00:09:16.852
and I know that the knowledge is there
and the solutions as well.

00:09:17.483 --> 00:09:21.380
Sure, some places
are more polluted than others,

00:09:21.404 --> 00:09:23.705
but this a global issue,

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:30.726
and no individual, no city,
no group, no country, no region

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.710
will be able to solve it alone.

00:09:34.549 --> 00:09:38.996
We need very strong commitments
and very strong action by everyone:

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.394
civil society,

00:09:41.418 --> 00:09:42.901
private sector,

00:09:42.925 --> 00:09:44.194
even individuals.

00:09:44.218 --> 00:09:46.162
We all have a role to play.

00:09:46.186 --> 00:09:50.184
Yes, we need to influence
the way we consume,

00:09:50.208 --> 00:09:51.841
the way we commute,

00:09:51.865 --> 00:09:54.501
the way we use our energy.

00:09:55.143 --> 00:09:59.806
And the good thing is that
all of those solutions are available.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:04.028
The question is, if we postpone
action by one day,

00:10:04.052 --> 00:10:07.429
there might be thousands
of lives that we will lose,

00:10:07.453 --> 00:10:10.173
but if we postpone it by one year,

00:10:10.197 --> 00:10:14.080
we might be losing again seven million.

00:10:14.762 --> 00:10:19.295
So every policy maker, every politician,

00:10:19.319 --> 00:10:23.723
needs to be aware of
the consequences on human health

00:10:23.747 --> 00:10:26.407
of postponing their decisions.

00:10:26.431 --> 00:10:27.757
In fact,

00:10:27.781 --> 00:10:29.907
this is not the first time in history

00:10:29.931 --> 00:10:35.377
that we are confronted
with the risks of this invisible killer.

00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:38.512
This was London in 1952,

00:10:38.536 --> 00:10:43.988
and as was done in London
in the '50s and the '60s,

00:10:44.774 --> 00:10:47.566
governments and cities,

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:53.953
they need to take urgent action to stop
the terrible impact of air pollution.

00:10:54.816 --> 00:11:00.978
Every politician must know that delaying
what they call the tough actions,

00:11:01.002 --> 00:11:07.837
like reducing traffic in cities
or investing in public transport

00:11:07.861 --> 00:11:12.864
and engaging in promoting
cycling in cities,

00:11:12.888 --> 00:11:15.224
investing in renewable energy,

00:11:15.248 --> 00:11:20.616
promoting cleaner energy
for cooking, cooling

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.564
and transportation and heating

00:11:23.588 --> 00:11:27.172
are solutions that are very smart,

00:11:27.196 --> 00:11:31.045
because, in fact, they reduce emissions,

00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:35.349
they improve air quality
in line with WHO standards,

00:11:35.373 --> 00:11:38.825
which are the standards
that will protect ourselves.

00:11:39.687 --> 00:11:46.657
So in fact, all politicians that we need
these very strong political commitments

00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:48.570
and political will from,

00:11:48.594 --> 00:11:50.387
but [we need] all of them now.

00:11:50.387 --> 00:11:54.849
Those who fail, who postpone action,

00:11:55.857 --> 00:12:01.428
they have been requested even
to defend their position in court.

00:12:01.452 --> 00:12:02.972
And from now on,

00:12:02.996 --> 00:12:07.873
no politician will be able
to say, "I didn't know."

00:12:07.897 --> 00:12:09.479
So the question here is:

00:12:09.503 --> 00:12:10.798
How many lives,

00:12:11.748 --> 00:12:14.475
loss of quality of life

00:12:14.499 --> 00:12:17.028
and losing our brain power

00:12:17.052 --> 00:12:19.136
are we ready to accept?

00:12:19.842 --> 00:12:22.311
If the answer is "none,"

00:12:22.335 --> 00:12:24.147
I will request that you,

00:12:24.171 --> 00:12:28.717
while our brains are still functioning,
while we are still intelligent,

00:12:28.741 --> 00:12:33.554
please exercise your right,
put pressure on your politicians

00:12:33.578 --> 00:12:37.923
and make sure that they take action
to stop the sources of air pollution.

00:12:37.947 --> 00:12:41.067
This is the first thing we need to do
to protect yourself

00:12:41.091 --> 00:12:43.880
and to protect our beautiful brain.

00:12:43.904 --> 00:12:45.388
Thank you very much.

00:12:45.921 --> 00:12:49.760
(Applause)
