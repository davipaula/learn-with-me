00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:15.969
Chris Anderson: So, you've been
obsessed with this problem

00:00:15.993 --> 00:00:17.757
for the last few years.

00:00:17.781 --> 00:00:19.821
What is the problem, in your own words?

00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:20.995
Andrew Forrest: Plastic.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.288
Simple as that.

00:00:23.312 --> 00:00:30.305
Our inability to use it for the tremendous
energetic commodity that it is,

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:31.705
and just throw it away.

00:00:32.838 --> 00:00:35.909
CA: And so we see waste everywhere.

00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.397
At its extreme, it looks a bit like this.

00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:40.752
I mean, where was this picture taken?

00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:42.226
AF: That's in the Philippines,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.155
and you know, there's a lot of rivers,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.561
which look exactly like that.

00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:47.894
And that's the Philippines.

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:49.489
So it's all over Southeast Asia.

00:00:49.688 --> 00:00:51.669
CA: So plastic is thrown into the rivers,

00:00:51.693 --> 00:00:54.302
and from there, of course,
it ends up in the ocean.

00:00:54.994 --> 00:00:58.567
I mean, we obviously
see it on the beaches,

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:01.133
but that's not even your main concern.

00:01:01.157 --> 00:01:04.624
It's what's actually happening to it
in the oceans. Talk about that.

00:01:04.648 --> 00:01:07.149
AF: OK, so look. Thank you, Chris.

00:01:07.173 --> 00:01:08.347
About four years ago,

00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:11.690
I thought I'd do something
really barking crazy,

00:01:11.714 --> 00:01:16.422
and I committed to do a PhD
in marine ecology.

00:01:16.446 --> 00:01:19.663
And the scary part about that was,

00:01:19.687 --> 00:01:21.604
sure, I learned a lot about marine life,

00:01:21.628 --> 00:01:23.848
but it taught me more about marine death

00:01:23.872 --> 00:01:30.032
and the extreme mass
ecological fatality of fish,

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:32.312
of marine life, marine mammals,

00:01:32.336 --> 00:01:34.800
very close biology to us,

00:01:34.824 --> 00:01:39.062
which are dying in the millions
if not trillions that we can't count

00:01:39.086 --> 00:01:40.762
at the hands of plastic.

00:01:40.786 --> 00:01:44.627
CA: But people think of plastic
as ugly but stable. Right?

00:01:44.652 --> 00:01:48.091
You throw something in the ocean,
"Hey, it'll just sit there forever.

00:01:48.115 --> 00:01:49.761
Can't do any damage, right?"

00:01:49.785 --> 00:01:56.552
AF: See, Chris, it's an incredible
substance designed for the economy.

00:01:56.576 --> 00:02:01.272
It is the worst substance possible
for the environment.

00:02:01.296 --> 00:02:04.483
The worst thing about plastics,
as soon as it hits the environment,

00:02:04.507 --> 00:02:07.291
is that it fragments.

00:02:07.315 --> 00:02:09.758
It never stops being plastic.

00:02:09.782 --> 00:02:12.477
It breaks down smaller
and smaller and smaller,

00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:15.149
and the breaking science on this, Chris,

00:02:15.173 --> 00:02:17.831
which we've known in marine ecology
for a few years now,

00:02:17.855 --> 00:02:19.795
but it's going to hit humans.

00:02:19.918 --> 00:02:23.089
We are aware now that nanoplastic,

00:02:23.113 --> 00:02:27.715
the very, very small particles of plastic,
carrying their negative charge,

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.541
can go straight through
the pores of your skin.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.565
That's not the bad news.

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:37.131
The bad news is that it goes
straight through the blood-brain barrier,

00:02:37.155 --> 00:02:40.039
that protective coating which is there
to protect your brain.

00:02:40.063 --> 00:02:44.070
Your brain's a little amorphous, wet mass
full of little electrical charges.

00:02:44.094 --> 00:02:47.371
You put a negative particle into that,

00:02:47.395 --> 00:02:50.924
particularly a negative particle
which can carry pathogens --

00:02:50.948 --> 00:02:54.532
so you have a negative charge,
it attracts positive-charge elements,

00:02:54.556 --> 00:02:56.980
like pathogens, toxins,

00:02:57.004 --> 00:02:58.451
mercury, lead.

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:01.848
That's the breaking science
we're going to see in the next 12 months.

00:03:01.873 --> 00:03:05.428
CA: So already I think you told me
that there's like 600 plastic bags or so

00:03:05.453 --> 00:03:09.014
for every fish that size
in the ocean, something like that.

00:03:09.388 --> 00:03:12.261
And they're breaking down,

00:03:12.285 --> 00:03:14.324
and there's going to be ever more of them,

00:03:14.348 --> 00:03:17.325
and we haven't even seen the start
of the consequences of that.

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:18.946
AF: No, we really haven't.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.194
The Ellen MacArthur Foundation,
they're a bunch of good scientists,

00:03:22.218 --> 00:03:24.266
we've been working with them for a while.

00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:26.031
I've completely verified their work.

00:03:26.055 --> 00:03:28.761
They say there will be
one ton of plastic, Chris,

00:03:28.785 --> 00:03:31.305
for every three tons
of fish by, not 2050 --

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.934
and I really get impatient with people
who talk about 2050 -- by 2025.

00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:37.201
That's around the corner.

00:03:37.225 --> 00:03:39.348
That's just the here and now.

00:03:39.372 --> 00:03:42.631
You don't need one ton of plastic
to completely wipe out marine life.

00:03:42.655 --> 00:03:45.717
Less than that is going
to do a fine job at it.

00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:50.211
So we have to end it straightaway.
We've got no time.

00:03:50.235 --> 00:03:54.604
CA: OK, so you have an idea for ending it,
and you're coming at this

00:03:54.628 --> 00:03:57.319
not as a typical environmental
campaigner, I would say,

00:03:57.343 --> 00:04:00.533
but as a businessman,
as an entrepreneur, who has lived --

00:04:00.557 --> 00:04:04.046
you've spent your whole life thinking
about global economic systems

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.723
and how they work.

00:04:05.747 --> 00:04:07.351
And if I understand it right,

00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:13.897
your idea depends on heroes
who look something like this.

00:04:13.921 --> 00:04:15.433
What's her profession?

00:04:15.457 --> 00:04:18.666
AF: She, Chris, is a ragpicker,

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.408
and there were 15, 20 million
ragpickers like her,

00:04:22.432 --> 00:04:26.688
until China stopped taking
everyone's waste.

00:04:26.712 --> 00:04:30.927
And the price of plastic,
minuscule that it was, collapsed.

00:04:30.951 --> 00:04:32.737
That led to people like her,

00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:36.979
which, now -- she is a child
who is a schoolchild.

00:04:37.003 --> 00:04:38.668
She should be at school.

00:04:38.692 --> 00:04:40.958
That's probably very akin to slavery.

00:04:40.982 --> 00:04:43.953
My daughter Grace and I have met
hundreds of people like her.

00:04:43.977 --> 00:04:47.532
CA: And there are many adults as well,
literally millions around the world,

00:04:47.556 --> 00:04:48.732
and in some industries,

00:04:48.756 --> 00:04:51.321
they actually account
for the fact that, for example,

00:04:51.345 --> 00:04:53.547
we don't see a lot
of metal waste in the world.

00:04:53.571 --> 00:04:54.791
AF: That's exactly right.

00:04:54.815 --> 00:04:57.945
That little girl is, in fact,
the hero of the environment.

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:01.576
She's in competition with
a great big petrochemical plant

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.950
which is just down the road,

00:05:02.974 --> 00:05:05.655
the three-and-a-half-billion-dollar
petrochemical plant.

00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:06.838
That's the problem.

00:05:06.862 --> 00:05:11.307
We've got more oil and gas
in plastic and landfill

00:05:11.331 --> 00:05:15.100
than we have in the entire oil and gas
resources of the United States.

00:05:15.124 --> 00:05:17.147
So she is the hero.

00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:20.137
And that's what that landfill looks like,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:05:20.161 --> 00:05:22.579
and it's solid oil and gas.

00:05:22.603 --> 00:05:26.275
CA: So there's huge value
potentially locked up in there

00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:30.838
that the world's ragpickers would,
if they could, make a living from.

00:05:30.862 --> 00:05:32.462
But why can't they?

00:05:33.303 --> 00:05:36.565
AF: Because we have ingrained in us

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:40.925
a price of plastic from fossil fuels,

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.520
which sits just under what it takes

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:49.094
to economically and profitably
recycle plastic from plastic.

00:05:49.118 --> 00:05:54.152
See, all plastic is
is building blocks from oil and gas.

00:05:54.176 --> 00:05:58.061
Plastic's 100 percent polymer,
which is 100 percent oil and gas.

00:05:58.085 --> 00:06:00.484
And you know we've got
enough plastic in the world

00:06:00.508 --> 00:06:01.688
for all our needs.

00:06:01.712 --> 00:06:04.232
And when we recycle plastic,

00:06:04.256 --> 00:06:07.521
if we can't recycle it cheaper
than fossil fuel plastic,

00:06:07.545 --> 00:06:10.880
then, of course, the world
just sticks to fossil fuel plastic.

00:06:10.904 --> 00:06:12.884
CA: So that's the fundamental problem,

00:06:12.908 --> 00:06:17.018
the price of recycled plastic
is usually more

00:06:17.042 --> 00:06:21.558
than the price of just buying
it made fresh from more oil.

00:06:21.582 --> 00:06:23.129
That's the fundamental problem.

00:06:23.153 --> 00:06:26.292
AF: A slight tweak
of the rules here, Chris.

00:06:26.316 --> 00:06:28.084
I'm a commodity person.

00:06:28.108 --> 00:06:35.107
I understand that we used to have
scrap metal and rubbish iron

00:06:35.131 --> 00:06:38.142
and bits of copper lying
all round the villages,

00:06:38.166 --> 00:06:39.995
particularly in the developing world.

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:41.915
And people worked out it's got a value.

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:45.094
It's actually an article of value,

00:06:45.118 --> 00:06:46.538
not of waste.

00:06:46.562 --> 00:06:49.740
Now the villages and the cities
and the streets are clean,

00:06:49.764 --> 00:06:54.302
you don't trip over scrap copper
or scrap iron now,

00:06:54.326 --> 00:06:57.681
because it's an article of value,
it gets recycled.

00:06:57.705 --> 00:07:03.298
CA: So what's your idea, then,
to try to change that in plastics?

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:04.934
AF: OK, so Chris,

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:08.917
for most part of that PhD,
I've been doing research.

00:07:08.941 --> 00:07:12.212
And the good thing about being
a businessperson who's done OK at it

00:07:12.236 --> 00:07:14.097
is that people want to see you.

00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:15.286
Other businesspeople,

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:19.413
even if you're kind of a bit of a zoo
animal species they'd like to check out,

00:07:19.437 --> 00:07:21.923
they'll say, yeah, OK,
we'll all meet Twiggy Forrest.

00:07:21.947 --> 00:07:23.816
And so once you're in there,

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.360
you can interrogate them.

00:07:25.384 --> 00:07:31.353
And I've been to most of the oil and gas
and fast-moving consumer good companies

00:07:31.377 --> 00:07:32.578
in the world,

00:07:32.602 --> 00:07:35.682
and there is a real will to change.

00:07:35.706 --> 00:07:37.511
I mean, there's a couple of dinosaurs

00:07:37.535 --> 00:07:40.023
who are going to hope
for the best and do nothing,

00:07:40.047 --> 00:07:41.997
but there's a real will to change.

00:07:42.021 --> 00:07:43.810
So what I've been discussing is,

00:07:43.834 --> 00:07:47.310
the seven and a half billion
people in the world

00:07:47.334 --> 00:07:51.251
don't actually deserve to have
their environment smashed by plastic,

00:07:51.275 --> 00:07:56.487
their oceans rendered depauperate
or barren of sea life because of plastic.

00:07:56.511 --> 00:07:57.944
So you come down that chain,

00:07:57.968 --> 00:08:02.111
and there's tens of thousands of brands
which we all buy heaps of products from,

00:08:02.135 --> 00:08:05.610
but then there's only a hundred
major resin producers,

00:08:05.634 --> 00:08:07.770
big petrochemical plants,

00:08:07.794 --> 00:08:10.513
that spew out all the plastic
which is single use.

00:08:10.537 --> 00:08:11.920
CA: So one hundred companies

00:08:11.944 --> 00:08:14.445
are right at the base
of this food chain, as it were.

00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:15.628
AF: Yeah.

00:08:15.652 --> 00:08:18.597
CA: And so what do you need
those one hundred companies to do?

00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:23.170
AF: OK, so we need them
to simply raise the value

00:08:23.194 --> 00:08:26.058
of the building blocks of plastic
from oil and gas,

00:08:26.082 --> 00:08:28.657
which I call "bad plastic,"

00:08:28.681 --> 00:08:29.983
raise the value of that,

00:08:30.007 --> 00:08:33.836
so that when it spreads through the brands
and onto us, the customers,

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:38.317
we won't barely even notice
an increase in our coffee cup

00:08:38.341 --> 00:08:41.324
or Coke or Pepsi, or anything.

00:08:41.348 --> 00:08:43.112
CA: Like, what, like a cent extra?

00:08:43.136 --> 00:08:45.134
AF: Less. Quarter of a cent, half a cent.

00:08:45.158 --> 00:08:48.348
It'll be absolutely minimal.

00:08:48.372 --> 00:08:49.625
But what it does,

00:08:49.649 --> 00:08:54.341
it makes every bit of plastic
all over the world an article of value.

00:08:54.365 --> 00:08:57.842
Where you have the waste worst,

00:08:57.866 --> 00:08:59.750
say Southeast Asia, India,

00:08:59.774 --> 00:09:01.855
that's where the wealth is most.

00:09:01.879 --> 00:09:04.332
CA: OK, so it feels like
there's two parts to this.

00:09:04.356 --> 00:09:08.354
One is, if they will charge more money

00:09:08.378 --> 00:09:11.561
but carve out that excess

00:09:11.585 --> 00:09:16.055
and pay it -- into what? --
a fund operated by someone

00:09:16.079 --> 00:09:18.844
to tackle this problem of -- what?

00:09:18.868 --> 00:09:22.459
What would that money be used for,
that they charge the extra for?

00:09:22.483 --> 00:09:24.943
AF: So when I speak
to really big businesses,

00:09:24.967 --> 00:09:28.513
I say, "Look, I need you to change,
and I need you to change really fast,"

00:09:28.537 --> 00:09:31.253
their eyes are going
to peel over in boredom,

00:09:31.277 --> 00:09:33.616
unless I say, "And it's good business."

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.733
"OK, now you've got my attention, Andrew."

00:09:35.757 --> 00:09:38.593
So I say, "Right, I need
you to make a contribution

00:09:38.617 --> 00:09:41.153
to an environmental
and industry transition fund.

00:09:41.177 --> 00:09:42.612
Over two or three years,

00:09:42.636 --> 00:09:44.833
the entire global plastics industry

00:09:44.857 --> 00:09:48.963
can transition from getting
its building blocks from fossil fuel

00:09:48.987 --> 00:09:51.082
to getting its building
blocks from plastic.

00:09:51.106 --> 00:09:52.567
The technology is out there.

00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:53.861
It's proven."

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:57.362
I've taken two multibillion-dollar
operations from nothing,

00:09:57.386 --> 00:10:00.205
recognizing that
the technology can be scaled.

00:10:00.229 --> 00:10:04.723
I see at least a dozen technologies
in plastic to handle all types of plastic.

00:10:04.747 --> 00:10:08.299
So once those technologies
have an economic margin,

00:10:08.323 --> 00:10:10.245
which this gives them,

00:10:10.269 --> 00:10:13.533
that's where the global public
will get all their plastic from,

00:10:13.557 --> 00:10:15.431
from existing plastic.

00:10:15.455 --> 00:10:19.596
CA: So every sale of virgin plastic
contributes money to a fund

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.454
that is used to basically
transition the industry

00:10:22.478 --> 00:10:25.321
and start to pay for things
like cleanup and other pieces.

00:10:25.345 --> 00:10:26.710
AF: Absolutely. Absolutely.

00:10:26.734 --> 00:10:28.746
CA: And it has
the incredible side benefit,

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.551
which is maybe even the main benefit,

00:10:30.575 --> 00:10:31.925
of creating a market.

00:10:31.949 --> 00:10:35.081
It suddenly makes recyclable plastic

00:10:35.105 --> 00:10:39.694
a giant business that can unlock
millions of people around the world

00:10:39.718 --> 00:10:41.559
to find a new living collecting it.

00:10:41.583 --> 00:10:42.736
AF: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.284
So all you do is, you've got fossil
fuel plastics at this value

00:10:47.308 --> 00:10:49.365
and recycled plastic at this value.

00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:50.702
You change it.

00:10:50.726 --> 00:10:53.313
So recycled plastic is cheaper.

00:10:53.636 --> 00:10:56.803
What I love about this most, Chris,
is that, you know,

00:10:56.827 --> 00:11:02.378
we waste into the environment
300, 350 million tons of plastic.

00:11:02.402 --> 00:11:04.939
On the oil and gas companies own accounts,

00:11:04.963 --> 00:11:06.979
it's going to grow to 500 million tons.

00:11:07.003 --> 00:11:09.431
This is an accelerating problem.

00:11:09.455 --> 00:11:13.205
But every ton of that is polymer.

00:11:13.229 --> 00:11:16.733
Polymer is 1,000 dollars,
1,500 dollars a ton.

00:11:16.757 --> 00:11:20.861
That's half a trillion dollars
which could go into business

00:11:20.885 --> 00:11:24.424
and could create jobs and opportunities
and wealth right across the world,

00:11:24.448 --> 00:11:26.447
particularly in the most impoverished.

00:11:26.471 --> 00:11:27.728
Yet we throw it away.

00:11:27.752 --> 00:11:31.132
CA: So this would allow the big companies
to invest in recycling plants

00:11:31.156 --> 00:11:32.665
literally all over the world --

00:11:32.689 --> 00:11:33.841
AF: All over the world.

00:11:33.865 --> 00:11:35.913
Because the technology
is low-capital cost,

00:11:35.937 --> 00:11:38.974
you can put it in at rubbish dumps,
at the bottom of big hotels,

00:11:38.998 --> 00:11:40.300
garbage depots, everywhere,

00:11:40.324 --> 00:11:41.618
turn that waste into resin.

00:11:41.642 --> 00:11:43.240
CA: Now, you're a philanthropist,

00:11:43.264 --> 00:11:46.053
and you're ready to commit
some of your own wealth to this.

00:11:46.077 --> 00:11:48.375
What is the role of philanthropy
in this project?

00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:52.233
AF: I think what we have to do
is kick in the 40 to 50 million US dollars

00:11:52.257 --> 00:11:53.657
to get it going,

00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:56.150
and then we have to create
absolute transparency

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:59.404
so everyone can see
exactly what's going on.

00:11:59.428 --> 00:12:02.688
From the resin producers
to the brands to the consumers,

00:12:02.712 --> 00:12:05.236
everyone gets to see
who is playing the game,

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.918
who is protecting the Earth,
and who doesn't care.

00:12:07.942 --> 00:12:10.273
And that'll cost about
a million dollars a week,

00:12:10.297 --> 00:12:12.683
and we're going to underwrite
that for five years.

00:12:12.707 --> 00:12:15.537
Total contribution is circa
300 million US dollars.

00:12:15.561 --> 00:12:16.888
CA: Wow.

00:12:16.912 --> 00:12:18.165
Now --

00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:23.071
(Applause)

00:12:23.095 --> 00:12:26.526
You've talked to other companies,
like to the Coca-Colas of this world,

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.688
who are willing to do this,
they're willing to pay a higher price,

00:12:29.712 --> 00:12:31.539
they would like to pay a higher price,

00:12:31.563 --> 00:12:32.718
so long as it's fair.

00:12:32.742 --> 00:12:35.126
AF: Yeah, it's fair.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:38.305
So, Coca-Cola wouldn't
like Pepsi to play ball

00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:41.126
unless the whole world knew
that Pepsi wasn't playing ball.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.324
Then they don't care.

00:12:42.348 --> 00:12:45.242
So it's that transparency of the market

00:12:45.266 --> 00:12:47.600
where, if people try and cheat the system,

00:12:47.624 --> 00:12:49.985
the market can see it,
the consumers can see it.

00:12:50.009 --> 00:12:52.135
The consumers want a role to play in this.

00:12:52.159 --> 00:12:53.686
Seven and a half billion of us.

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.320
We don't want our world smashed
by a hundred companies.

00:12:56.344 --> 00:12:59.152
CA: Well, so tell us, you've said
what the companies can do

00:12:59.176 --> 00:13:00.643
and what you're willing to do.

00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:02.060
What can people listening do?

00:13:02.084 --> 00:13:04.381
AF: OK, so I would like all of us,

00:13:04.405 --> 00:13:05.604
all around the world,

00:13:05.628 --> 00:13:08.712
to go a website called noplasticwaste.org.

00:13:08.736 --> 00:13:10.862
You contact your hundred resin producers

00:13:10.886 --> 00:13:12.326
which are in your region.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.023
You will have at least one

00:13:14.047 --> 00:13:18.481
within an email or Twitter
or a telephone contact from you,

00:13:18.505 --> 00:13:23.940
and let them know that you would like them
to make a contribution to a fund

00:13:23.964 --> 00:13:26.591
which industry can manage
or the World Bank can manage.

00:13:26.615 --> 00:13:30.309
It raises tens of billions
of dollars per year

00:13:30.333 --> 00:13:35.015
so you can transition the industry
to getting all its plastic from plastic,

00:13:35.039 --> 00:13:36.211
not from fossil fuel.

00:13:36.235 --> 00:13:38.482
We don't need that.
That's bad. This is good.

00:13:38.506 --> 00:13:40.518
And it can clean up the environment.

00:13:40.542 --> 00:13:42.095
We've got enough capital there,

00:13:42.119 --> 00:13:45.076
we've got tens of billions
of dollars, Chris, per annum

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.532
to clean up the environment.

00:13:46.556 --> 00:13:48.331
CA: You're in the recycling business.

00:13:48.355 --> 00:13:50.361
Isn't this a conflict of interest for you,

00:13:50.385 --> 00:13:52.594
or rather, a huge business
opportunity for you?

00:13:52.619 --> 00:13:54.750
AF: Yeah, look, I'm in
the iron ore business,

00:13:54.775 --> 00:13:56.984
and I compete against
the scrap metal business,

00:13:57.008 --> 00:14:00.443
and that's why you don't have
any scrap lying around to trip over,

00:14:00.467 --> 00:14:01.916
and cut your toe on,

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.216
because it gets collected.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.534
CA: This isn't your excuse
to go into the plastic recycling business.

00:14:06.558 --> 00:14:08.879
AF: No, I am going to cheer for this boom.

00:14:08.903 --> 00:14:11.014
This will be the internet
of plastic waste.

00:14:11.038 --> 00:14:14.377
This will be a boom industry
which will spread all over the world,

00:14:14.401 --> 00:14:18.460
and particularly where poverty is worst
because that's where the rubbish is most,

00:14:18.484 --> 00:14:19.800
and that's the resource.

00:14:19.824 --> 00:14:23.031
So I'm going to cheer for it
and stand back.

00:14:23.055 --> 00:14:24.400
CA: Twiggy, we're in an era

00:14:24.424 --> 00:14:29.089
where so many people around the world
are craving a new, regenerative economy,

00:14:29.113 --> 00:14:31.742
these big supply chains,
these big industries,

00:14:31.766 --> 00:14:33.807
to fundamentally transform.

00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:35.563
It strikes me as a giant idea,

00:14:35.587 --> 00:14:38.647
and you're going to need a lot of people
cheering you on your way

00:14:38.671 --> 00:14:39.837
to make it happen.

00:14:39.861 --> 00:14:41.536
Thank you for sharing this with us.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.584
AF: Thank you very much. Thank you, Chris.

00:14:43.608 --> 00:14:45.100
(Applause)
