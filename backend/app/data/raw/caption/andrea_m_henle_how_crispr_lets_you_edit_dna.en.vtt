00:00:06.805 --> 00:00:09.355
From the smallest single-celled organism

00:00:09.355 --> 00:00:11.245
to the largest creatures on earth,

00:00:11.245 --> 00:00:14.935
every living thing is defined 
by its genes.

00:00:14.935 --> 00:00:20.055
The DNA contained in our genes acts like
an instruction manual for our cells.

00:00:20.058 --> 00:00:24.798
Four building blocks called bases are 
strung together in precise sequences,

00:00:24.798 --> 00:00:26.758
which tell the cell how to behave

00:00:26.758 --> 00:00:30.188
and form the basis for our every trait.

00:00:30.188 --> 00:00:33.188
But with recent advancements 
in gene editing tools,

00:00:33.188 --> 00:00:37.998
scientists can change an organism’s
fundamental features in record time.

00:00:37.998 --> 00:00:40.906
They can engineer drought-resistant crops

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:43.426
and create apples that don’t brown.

00:00:43.426 --> 00:00:46.466
They might even prevent the spread 
of infectious outbreaks

00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:49.506
and develop cures for genetic diseases.

00:00:49.506 --> 00:00:53.726
CRISPR is the fastest, easiest, and 
cheapest of the gene editing tools

00:00:53.726 --> 00:00:56.996
responsible for this new wave of science.

00:00:56.996 --> 00:00:59.346
But where did this medical 
marvel come from?

00:00:59.346 --> 00:01:00.326
How does it work?

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:02.676
And what can it do?

00:01:02.676 --> 00:01:06.716
Surprisingly, CRISPR is actually a 
natural process

00:01:06.716 --> 00:01:10.402
that’s long functioned as a 
bacterial immune system.

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:14.592
Originally found defending single-celled 
bacteria and archaea

00:01:14.592 --> 00:01:16.512
against invading viruses,

00:01:16.512 --> 00:01:20.512
naturally occurring CRISPR uses 
two main components.

00:01:20.512 --> 00:01:24.662
The first are short snippets of 
repetitive DNA sequences

00:01:24.662 --> 00:01:30.062
called “clustered regularly interspaced 
short palindromic repeats,”

00:01:30.062 --> 00:01:32.052
or simply, CRISPRs.

00:01:32.052 --> 00:01:33.742
The second are Cas,

00:01:33.742 --> 00:01:36.312
or “CRISPR-associated” proteins

00:01:36.312 --> 00:01:40.012
which chop up DNA like molecular scissors.

00:01:40.012 --> 00:01:42.622
When a virus invades a bacterium,

00:01:42.622 --> 00:01:46.262
Cas proteins cut out a segment 
of the viral DNA

00:01:46.262 --> 00:01:49.572
to stitch into the bacterium’s 
CRISPR region,

00:01:49.572 --> 00:01:53.062
capturing a chemical snapshot 
of the infection.

00:01:53.062 --> 00:01:58.162
Those viral codes are then copied 
into short pieces of RNA.

00:01:58.162 --> 00:02:01.176
This molecule plays many roles 
in our cells,

00:02:01.176 --> 00:02:02.806
but in the case of CRISPR,

00:02:02.806 --> 00:02:07.106
RNA binds to a special protein 
called Cas9.

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:10.211
The resulting complexes act like scouts,

00:02:10.211 --> 00:02:13.431
latching onto free-floating 
genetic material

00:02:13.431 --> 00:02:16.061
and searching for a match to the virus.

00:02:16.061 --> 00:02:20.561
If the virus invades again, the scout
complex recognizes it immediately,

00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:24.743
and Cas9 swiftly destroys the viral DNA.

00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:27.949
Lots of bacteria have this type 
of defense mechanism.

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:32.709
But in 2012, scientists figured out 
how to hijack CRISPR

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.999
to target not just viral DNA,

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:38.849
but any DNA in almost any organism.

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.249
With the right tools,

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:44.539
this viral immune system becomes a 
precise gene-editing tool,

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.819
which can alter DNA and 
change specific genes

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.139
almost as easily as fixing a typo.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.939
Here’s how it works in the lab:

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:57.689
scientists design a “guide” RNA 
to match the gene they want to edit,

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.929
and attach it to Cas9.

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:03.089
Like the viral RNA in the 
CRISPR immune system,

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:07.029
the guide RNA directs Cas9 
to the target gene,

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:11.029
and the protein’s molecular scissors 
snip the DNA.

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:13.559
This is the key to CRISPR’s power:

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:19.149
just by injecting Cas9 bound to a short 
piece of custom guide RNA

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:23.393
scientists can edit practically 
any gene in the genome.

00:03:23.393 --> 00:03:25.070
Once the DNA is cut,

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.030
the cell will try to repair it.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.440
Typically, proteins called nucleases

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.940
trim the broken ends and 
join them back together.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.630
But this type of repair process,

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.050
called nonhomologous end joining,

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.330
is prone to mistakes

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.670
and can lead to extra or missing bases.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.830
The resulting gene is often unusable 
and turned off.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.402
However, if scientists add a separate 
sequence of template DNA

00:03:50.402 --> 00:03:52.072
to their CRISPR cocktail,

00:03:52.072 --> 00:03:56.282
cellular proteins can perform 
a different DNA repair process,

00:03:56.282 --> 00:03:58.862
called homology directed repair.

00:03:58.862 --> 00:04:03.332
This template DNA is used as a blueprint 
to guide the rebuilding process,

00:04:03.332 --> 00:04:04.971
repairing a defective gene

00:04:04.971 --> 00:04:08.441
or even inserting a completely new one.

00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:10.526
The ability to fix DNA errors

00:04:10.526 --> 00:04:14.386
means that CRISPR could potentially 
create new treatments for diseases

00:04:14.386 --> 00:04:19.176
linked to specific genetic errors, like 
cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia.

00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:20.956
And since it’s not limited to humans,

00:04:20.956 --> 00:04:23.896
the applications are almost endless.

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:27.426
CRISPR could create plants 
that yield larger fruit,

00:04:27.426 --> 00:04:30.086
mosquitoes that can’t transmit malaria,

00:04:30.086 --> 00:04:33.614
or even reprogram drug-resistant 
cancer cells.

00:04:33.614 --> 00:04:36.394
It’s also a powerful tool 
for studying the genome,

00:04:36.394 --> 00:04:39.704
allowing scientists to watch 
what happens when genes are turned off

00:04:39.704 --> 00:04:42.204
or changed within an organism.

00:04:42.204 --> 00:04:44.104
CRISPR isn’t perfect yet.

00:04:44.104 --> 00:04:47.574
It doesn’t always make 
just the intended changes,

00:04:47.574 --> 00:04:52.084
and since it’s difficult to predict the 
long-term implications of a CRISPR edit,

00:04:52.084 --> 00:04:55.689
this technology raises 
big ethical questions.

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:58.359
It’s up to us to decide the 
best course forward

00:04:58.359 --> 00:05:01.839
as CRISPR leaves single-celled 
organisms behind

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:06.109
and heads into labs, farms, hospitals,

00:05:06.109 --> 00:05:09.187
and organisms around the world.
