00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:17.039
Today, what I want to share with you
is something that happened to me,

00:00:17.063 --> 00:00:19.539
actually, around four
weeks ago, it happened.

00:00:19.912 --> 00:00:26.227
Words were said to me that I never thought
I would ever hear it said to my face

00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:27.401
by another human being.

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.736
And those words, they shattered my heart.

00:00:33.578 --> 00:00:37.244
And at the same time,
they filled it with so much hope.

00:00:38.387 --> 00:00:43.149
And the whole experience
renewed my commitment

00:00:43.173 --> 00:00:45.744
to the idea that I came
to share with you today.

00:00:45.768 --> 00:00:51.847
You see, I tell everyone
that I am a haunted person.

00:00:51.871 --> 00:00:56.053
What haunts me is the impossible stories,

00:00:56.077 --> 00:00:59.164
story after story after story after story

00:00:59.188 --> 00:01:03.619
of young people, my people, people like me

00:01:04.752 --> 00:01:09.244
dying out there on the ocean, right now,
laying at the bottom of the ocean,

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:10.668
serving as fish food.

00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:15.656
Do you really think
that's the best we can do?

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.147
To serve as fish food?

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:20.903
And for those of them
who are trying to migrate to Europe --

00:01:20.927 --> 00:01:22.649
because that's what it is all about,

00:01:22.673 --> 00:01:25.062
they are trying to migrate
to Europe to find a job.

00:01:25.086 --> 00:01:26.353
Going through Libya.

00:01:27.498 --> 00:01:30.864
Do you know what happens to us
when we're trying to cross through Libya

00:01:30.888 --> 00:01:32.426
and we're trapped over there?

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.124
Well, we're being sold as slaves.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.847
For 300 dollars,
maybe sometimes 500 dollars.

00:01:43.474 --> 00:01:46.907
Sometimes I hear stories
of bodies that fall off an airplane.

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:51.006
Somebody hid in
the landing gear of a plane

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.712
or in the cargo section of a plane,

00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:54.719
and then you find them frozen to death.

00:01:56.346 --> 00:01:59.992
Wouldn't you be haunted if, like me,
from the moment you were a little girl,

00:02:00.016 --> 00:02:02.779
you hear these stories
and they keep repeating themselves,

00:02:02.803 --> 00:02:03.978
over and over and over?

00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:05.502
Wouldn't you be haunted?

00:02:05.988 --> 00:02:07.138
That's my case.

00:02:07.917 --> 00:02:10.540
And at the same time, you know,
as my people are dying,

00:02:10.564 --> 00:02:11.811
my culture is also dying.

00:02:11.835 --> 00:02:13.002
There, I said it.

00:02:13.026 --> 00:02:15.465
Because, you know,
we have this culture inferiority,

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.775
which means that anything
that comes from us is not good enough.

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.244
But you know, in my situation,

00:02:20.268 --> 00:02:25.537
and because I was raised to criticize
by creating, it's Michelangelos.

00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:27.887
My father said, "Do not
come to me with problems

00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:29.968
unless you thought
of a couple alternatives.

00:02:29.992 --> 00:02:31.355
They don't have to be right,

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.958
but I just want to know
that you thought of something."

00:02:33.982 --> 00:02:37.704
So, I have this attitude in life --
something is wrong, find a way to fix it.

00:02:37.728 --> 00:02:40.141
And that's why I start
the businesses that I start,

00:02:40.165 --> 00:02:41.673
that's usually consumer brands,

00:02:41.697 --> 00:02:44.650
that have embedded in them
the very best of my African culture.

00:02:44.674 --> 00:02:49.601
And what I do is it's all packaged,
21st century, world-class tendered,

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:54.492
and I bring that to one of the most
sophisticated markets in the world,

00:02:54.516 --> 00:02:55.666
which is the US.

00:02:56.984 --> 00:02:58.801
First company was a beverage company,

00:02:58.825 --> 00:03:02.426
second one is a skin care company,
third one is launching next month,

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.458
and they all have that in common.

00:03:05.823 --> 00:03:08.784
So, why are these people leaving?

00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:12.436
They're leaving because they have no jobs.

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:15.831
They're leaving because
where they are, there's no jobs.

00:03:15.855 --> 00:03:17.005
So ...

00:03:18.053 --> 00:03:24.953
But poverty, that's really striking them,
is the root cause of why they're leaving.

00:03:24.977 --> 00:03:27.000
Now, why are people poor?

00:03:27.024 --> 00:03:29.073
People are poor
because they have no money.

00:03:29.097 --> 00:03:31.723
You have no money
because you have no source of income.

00:03:31.747 --> 00:03:33.974
And for most of us,
what is a source of income?

00:03:33.998 --> 00:03:37.156
For most of us, what is our
source of income, what is it, tell me?

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.331
Jobs, thank you.

00:03:38.355 --> 00:03:39.654
Where do jobs come from?

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.219
Come from where?

00:03:43.627 --> 00:03:45.571
Businesses, thank you.

00:03:46.143 --> 00:03:50.135
Now, if jobs is what fixes poverty,

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:52.553
and jobs come from businesses,

00:03:52.577 --> 00:03:53.951
don't you think --

00:03:53.975 --> 00:03:57.295
especially, they come from small
and medium size enterprises, SMEs --

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.296
then don't you think, maybe for a second,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.253
that we should focus on making it easy
for a small-business person

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:05.832
to start and run their business?

00:04:05.856 --> 00:04:07.610
Don't you think that it makes sense?

00:04:07.634 --> 00:04:10.626
Why is it that when I look
at the Doing Business index ranking

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.808
of the World Bank,

00:04:11.832 --> 00:04:14.521
that ranks every country in the world

00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:17.149
in terms of how easy or hard
it is to start a company,

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:20.109
you tell me why African countries,

00:04:20.133 --> 00:04:21.489
all 50 of them,

00:04:21.513 --> 00:04:23.810
are basically at the bottom of that list?

00:04:26.824 --> 00:04:28.386
That's why we're poor.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.120
We're poor because
it is literally impossible

00:04:31.144 --> 00:04:34.172
to do businesses
in these countries of ours.

00:04:34.196 --> 00:04:37.101
But I'm going to tell you exactly
what it means on the ground

00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:38.276
for someone like me.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.317
I have a manufacturing
facility in Senegal.

00:04:40.341 --> 00:04:44.523
Did you know that for all my raw material
that I can't find in the country,

00:04:44.547 --> 00:04:47.728
I have to pay a 45 percent tariff
on everything that comes in?

00:04:48.066 --> 00:04:50.058
Forty-five percent tariff.

00:04:51.217 --> 00:04:53.863
Do you know that,
even to look for fine cardboard

00:04:53.887 --> 00:04:55.974
to ship my finished products to the US,

00:04:55.998 --> 00:04:57.997
I can't find new, finished cardboard?

00:04:58.021 --> 00:04:59.212
Impossible.

00:04:59.236 --> 00:05:01.678
Because the distributors
are not going to come here

00:05:01.702 --> 00:05:02.942
to start their business,

00:05:02.966 --> 00:05:04.642
because it makes no sense, either.

00:05:04.666 --> 00:05:07.761
So right now, I have to mobilize
3000 dollars' worth of cardboard

00:05:07.785 --> 00:05:09.968
in my warehouse,
so that I can have cardboard,

00:05:09.992 --> 00:05:12.092
and they won't arrive
for another five weeks.

00:05:12.116 --> 00:05:16.381
The fact that we are stifled
with the most nonsensical laws out there.

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:19.354
That's why we can't run businesses.

00:05:19.378 --> 00:05:21.520
It's like swimming through molasses.

00:05:21.544 --> 00:05:25.345
So, what can you do about that?

00:05:26.355 --> 00:05:30.022
I told you today that someone
said to me words that marked me,

00:05:30.046 --> 00:05:33.545
because I explained the same thing
to my employees in Senegal.

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:36.082
And one of them started crying --
her name is Yahara.

00:05:36.106 --> 00:05:37.482
She started crying.

00:05:37.506 --> 00:05:38.911
I said, "Why are you crying?"

00:05:38.935 --> 00:05:42.460
She said, "I'm crying
because I had come to believe --

00:05:42.484 --> 00:05:44.650
always seeing us
represented as poor people --

00:05:44.674 --> 00:05:49.063
I had come to believe that maybe,
yes, maybe we are inferior.

00:05:49.087 --> 00:05:51.491
Because, otherwise, how do you explain

00:05:51.515 --> 00:05:54.273
that we're always
in the begging situation?"

00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:56.101
That's what broke my heart.

00:05:56.125 --> 00:05:58.037
But at the same time that she said that,

00:05:58.061 --> 00:06:00.744
because of how I explained
just what I explained to you,

00:06:00.768 --> 00:06:03.267
she said, "But now, I know
that I am not the problem.

00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:06.052
It is my environment in which I live,
that's my problem."

00:06:06.076 --> 00:06:07.861
I said, "Yes."

00:06:08.457 --> 00:06:10.033
And that's what gave me hope --

00:06:10.057 --> 00:06:13.585
that once people get it,
they now change their outlook on life.

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:16.162
Here, what are some
of our solutions, then?

00:06:16.186 --> 00:06:17.637
If jobs is a solution,

00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:20.803
don't you think, then,
that we should be simplifying

00:06:20.827 --> 00:06:23.286
the business environment
of all of these countries?

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.506
Don't you think?

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.116
And along with you,

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.156
I would like for all of your friends
from the other 50 countries

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.910
that are on the bottom of that list
to do the same thing.

00:06:31.934 --> 00:06:33.799
You do that, we do the rest of the job.

00:06:33.823 --> 00:06:36.204
I'm doing my part of the game,
what are you doing?

00:06:36.228 --> 00:06:37.387
(Applause)

00:06:37.411 --> 00:06:38.672
What are you doing?

00:06:38.696 --> 00:06:40.840
(Applause)

00:06:40.864 --> 00:06:42.132
What are you doing?

00:06:42.156 --> 00:06:43.307
(Applause)

00:06:43.331 --> 00:06:45.419
And as for you,
everybody here in this room,

00:06:45.443 --> 00:06:47.260
I leave you with two marching orders.

00:06:47.284 --> 00:06:48.459
Get in the game,

00:06:48.483 --> 00:06:50.672
and the way you get in it
is educate yourself,

00:06:50.696 --> 00:06:52.237
build awareness around yourself,

00:06:52.261 --> 00:06:55.212
and then also advocate
for e-government solutions.

00:06:55.236 --> 00:06:58.117
He said, "Oh, corruption,
how do we fight corruption?"

00:06:58.141 --> 00:07:00.379
Well, as a matter of fact,
I'm here to tell you

00:07:00.403 --> 00:07:02.617
that yes, you can do it
by the stroke of a pen.

00:07:02.641 --> 00:07:05.934
You do not need anyone to tell you
when and how to do that.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.201
It is one thing, actually,

00:07:07.225 --> 00:07:10.164
that you don't need to wait
for anyone to do, so do it.

00:07:10.188 --> 00:07:13.466
Otherwise, don't come and tell me
that you want to fix corruption.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.197
You and your other 50 friends
from the other 50 countries

00:07:16.221 --> 00:07:17.982
that are at the bottom of that list.

00:07:18.006 --> 00:07:20.371
That's how you fight corruption.

00:07:20.395 --> 00:07:23.721
If you were only charging me 5 percent
to get my stuff in the country,

00:07:23.745 --> 00:07:24.903
my raw material,

00:07:24.927 --> 00:07:26.212
instead of the 45 percent,

00:07:26.236 --> 00:07:28.974
do you really think
that I would have to go a pay a bribe?

00:07:28.998 --> 00:07:30.776
That's what breeds corruption.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.252
Bad laws, sets of horrible, nonsense laws.

00:07:35.276 --> 00:07:37.664
(Applause) (Cheers)

00:07:37.688 --> 00:07:38.839
Right?

00:07:38.863 --> 00:07:44.172
(Applause)

00:07:44.196 --> 00:07:46.006
You want to fight corruption?

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:47.236
That's what you do.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.837
And again, remember,
you don't need to wait for anyone.

00:07:49.861 --> 00:07:51.235
You can do that by yourself.

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:54.102
Unless you're telling me
that maybe you have no sovereignty,

00:07:54.126 --> 00:07:55.745
and that's a whole other problem.

00:07:55.769 --> 00:08:02.626
OK, so, from here on,
I have simple words for our "leaders."

00:08:03.648 --> 00:08:05.417
This can go two ways.

00:08:06.092 --> 00:08:07.742
It can go the nasty way,

00:08:07.766 --> 00:08:10.459
because we have hundreds
of millions of young people

00:08:10.483 --> 00:08:13.307
coming to life right now, here,

00:08:13.331 --> 00:08:15.982
and if they don't have an outlook in life,

00:08:16.006 --> 00:08:17.855
they are going to go for a revolution.

00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:19.482
They're going to go for violence.

00:08:19.506 --> 00:08:21.070
And none of us wants that.

00:08:21.094 --> 00:08:22.244
None, none of us.

00:08:22.807 --> 00:08:24.220
That's the one way it can go.

00:08:24.244 --> 00:08:25.768
Or the second way it can go is,

00:08:25.792 --> 00:08:29.133
all this happens peacefully, productively,
and everything is good,

00:08:29.157 --> 00:08:31.719
and you do what you need to do,
you get out of my way,

00:08:31.743 --> 00:08:34.990
you let people like me do our job,
we create all these jobs we need,

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:38.720
and then Africa becomes
this very prosperous country

00:08:38.744 --> 00:08:41.728
that it's designed to be,
it should have been for a long time.

00:08:41.752 --> 00:08:44.905
It happens like that, everybody's happy,
we move on with our lives.

00:08:44.929 --> 00:08:46.323
It can happen in two ways --

00:08:46.347 --> 00:08:49.498
pick violence or you pick
the calm, productive way.

00:08:49.522 --> 00:08:51.077
I want the calm, productive way.

00:08:51.101 --> 00:08:53.355
None of us should ever,
ever even try to think

00:08:53.379 --> 00:08:55.746
about what else could happen
if we don't go there.

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.100
So, please.

00:08:57.124 --> 00:08:58.355
And the time has come.

00:08:58.379 --> 00:09:02.061
This type of picture -- prosperity,
happiness, human flourishing --

00:09:02.085 --> 00:09:04.006
that's what I see if we do our job.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.188
Thank you.

00:09:05.212 --> 00:09:07.484
(Applause) (Cheering)

00:09:07.508 --> 00:09:08.682
Thank you.

00:09:08.706 --> 00:09:10.423
(Applause)
