00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:08.465
In 1956,

00:00:08.465 --> 00:00:10.185
architect Frank Lloyd Wright

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:13.005
proposed a mile-high skyscraper.

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:15.845
It was going to be the world’s 
tallest building,

00:00:15.845 --> 00:00:16.845
by a lot —

00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:20.325
five times as high as the Eiffel Tower.

00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:22.885
But many critics laughed at the architect,

00:00:22.885 --> 00:00:26.215
arguing that people would have to wait 
hours for an elevator,

00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:30.575
or worse, that the tower would collapse 
under its own weight.

00:00:30.575 --> 00:00:32.126
Most engineers agreed,

00:00:32.126 --> 00:00:34.506
and despite the publicity 
around the proposal,

00:00:34.506 --> 00:00:37.756
the titanic tower was never built.

00:00:37.756 --> 00:00:38.576
But today,

00:00:38.576 --> 00:00:41.956
bigger and bigger buildings are going up 
around the world.

00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:46.246
Firms are even planning skyscrapers 
more than a kilometer tall,

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:48.516
like the Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia,

00:00:48.516 --> 00:00:51.806
three times the size of the Eiffel Tower.

00:00:51.806 --> 00:00:52.716
Very soon,

00:00:52.716 --> 00:00:56.376
Wright’s mile-high miracle 
may be a reality.

00:00:56.376 --> 00:00:58.256
So what exactly was stopping us

00:00:58.256 --> 00:01:01.436
from building these megastructures 
70 years ago,

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:05.346
and how do we build something 
a mile high today?

00:01:05.346 --> 00:01:06.956
In any construction project,

00:01:06.956 --> 00:01:11.616
each story of the structure needs to be 
able to support the stories on top of it.

00:01:11.616 --> 00:01:12.726
The higher we build,

00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:17.556
the higher the gravitational pressure 
from the upper stories on the lower ones.

00:01:17.556 --> 00:01:20.753
This principle has long dictated 
the shape of our buildings,

00:01:20.753 --> 00:01:24.866
leading ancient architects to favor 
pyramids with wide foundations

00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.146
that support lighter upper levels.

00:01:27.146 --> 00:01:30.966
But this solution doesn’t quite translate 
to a city skyline–

00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:34.746
a pyramid that tall would be roughly 
one-and-a-half miles wide,

00:01:34.746 --> 00:01:37.526
tough to squeeze into a city center.

00:01:37.526 --> 00:01:42.846
Fortunately, strong materials like 
concrete can avoid this impractical shape.

00:01:42.846 --> 00:01:47.951
And modern concrete blends are reinforced 
with steel-fibers for strength

00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:51.781
and water-reducing polymers 
to prevent cracking.

00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:56.333
The concrete in the world’s tallest tower,
Dubai’s Burj Khalifa,

00:01:56.333 --> 00:02:00.673
can withstand about 8,000 tons of pressure
per square meter–

00:02:00.673 --> 00:02:05.540
the weight of over 1,200 
African elephants!

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.990
Of course, even if a building 
supports itself,

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.410
it still needs support from the ground.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.650
Without a foundation,

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.650
buildings this heavy would sink, fall, 
or lean over.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.260
To prevent the roughly half a million 
ton tower from sinking,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:27.050
192 concrete and steel supports called 
piles were buried over 50 meters deep.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.570
The friction between the piles 
and the ground

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.580
keeps this sizable structure standing.

00:02:32.588 --> 00:02:34.098
Besides defeating gravity,

00:02:34.098 --> 00:02:35.778
which pushes the building down,

00:02:35.778 --> 00:02:39.748
a skyscraper also needs to overcome 
the blowing wind,

00:02:39.748 --> 00:02:41.923
which pushes from the side.

00:02:41.923 --> 00:02:43.343
On average days,

00:02:43.343 --> 00:02:49.263
wind can exert up to 17 pounds of force 
per square meter on a high-rise building–

00:02:49.263 --> 00:02:52.200
as heavy as a gust of bowling balls.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.710
Designing structures to be aerodynamic,

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.090
like China’s sleek Shanghai Tower,

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.740
can reduce that force by up to a quarter.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.460
And wind-bearing frames inside or 
outside the building

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.620
can absorb the remaining wind force,

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.470
such as in Seoul’s Lotte Tower.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.540
But even after all these measures,

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.560
you could still find yourself swaying back
and forth

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.420
more than a meter on top floors 
during a hurricane.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.260
To prevent the wind from 
rocking tower tops,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.690
many skyscrapers employ a counterweight 
weighing hundreds of tons

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.127
called a “tuned mass damper.”

00:03:28.127 --> 00:03:30.151
The Taipei 101, for instance,

00:03:30.151 --> 00:03:34.811
has suspended a giant metal orb 
above the 87th floor.

00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:36.514
When wind moves the building,

00:03:36.514 --> 00:03:38.774
this orb sways into action,

00:03:38.774 --> 00:03:41.634
absorbing the building’s kinetic energy.

00:03:41.634 --> 00:03:43.794
As its movements trail the tower’s,

00:03:43.794 --> 00:03:46.794
hydraulic cylinders between the ball 
and the building

00:03:46.794 --> 00:03:49.484
convert that kinetic energy into heat,

00:03:49.484 --> 00:03:52.384
and stabilize the swaying structure.

00:03:52.386 --> 00:03:54.656
With all these technologies in place,

00:03:54.656 --> 00:03:58.226
our mega-structures can stay 
standing and stable.

00:03:58.226 --> 00:04:02.816
But quickly traveling through buildings 
this large is a challenge in itself.

00:04:02.816 --> 00:04:03.994
In Wright’s age,

00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:08.394
the fastest elevators moved 
a mere 22 kilometers per hour.

00:04:08.394 --> 00:04:13.849
Thankfully, today’s elevators are much
faster, traveling over 70 km per hour

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.694
with future cabins potentially using 
frictionless magnetic rails

00:04:17.694 --> 00:04:19.274
for even higher speeds.

00:04:19.274 --> 00:04:23.314
And traffic management algorithms 
group riders by destination

00:04:23.314 --> 00:04:27.914
to get passengers and empty cabins 
where they need to be.

00:04:27.914 --> 00:04:32.728
Skyscrapers have come a long way since 
Wright proposed his mile-high tower.

00:04:32.728 --> 00:04:35.426
What were once considered impossible ideas

00:04:35.426 --> 00:04:38.076
have become architectural opportunities.

00:04:38.076 --> 00:04:40.356
Today it may just be a matter of time

00:04:40.356 --> 00:04:44.356
until one building goes the extra mile.
