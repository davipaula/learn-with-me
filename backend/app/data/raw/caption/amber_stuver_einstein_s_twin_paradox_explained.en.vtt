00:00:06.036 --> 00:00:11.236
On their 20th birthday, identical twin 
astronauts volunteer for an experiment.

00:00:11.236 --> 00:00:15.311
Terra will remain on Earth, while Stella 
will board a spaceship.

00:00:15.311 --> 00:00:18.903
Stella’s ship will travel at 86.6% the 
speed of light

00:00:18.903 --> 00:00:21.653
to visit a star that is 10 
light-years away,

00:00:21.653 --> 00:00:23.843
then return to Earth at the same speed.

00:00:23.843 --> 00:00:25.773
As they prepare to part ways,

00:00:25.773 --> 00:00:28.713
the twins wonder what will happen 
when they’re reunited.

00:00:28.713 --> 00:00:32.353
Since a light year is exactly the distance
light can travel in a year,

00:00:32.353 --> 00:00:35.223
Stella’s journey should take 23 years.

00:00:35.223 --> 00:00:37.683
But from having studied 
special relativity,

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:40.563
the twins know it’s not that simple.

00:00:40.563 --> 00:00:43.813
First of all, the faster an object moves 
through space,

00:00:43.813 --> 00:00:48.593
the slower it moves through time 
compared to an unmoving observer.

00:00:48.593 --> 00:00:52.263
This relationship can be quantified with 
something called the Lorentz factor,

00:00:52.263 --> 00:00:54.503
which is defined by this equation.

00:00:54.503 --> 00:00:58.503
And secondly, the length of a moving 
object as measured by an observer at rest

00:00:58.503 --> 00:01:00.863
will contract by the same factor.

00:01:00.863 --> 00:01:05.253
At 86.6% of the speed of light 
the Lorentz factor is 2,

00:01:05.253 --> 00:01:08.953
meaning time will pass twice as slowly 
aboard the spaceship.

00:01:08.953 --> 00:01:12.407
Of course, Stella won’t notice 
time slowing down.

00:01:12.407 --> 00:01:16.407
That’s because all time-based processes 
in the ship will slow down as well–

00:01:16.407 --> 00:01:18.277
clocks and electrical devices;

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:21.697
Stella’s biological activities including 
her rate of aging

00:01:21.697 --> 00:01:24.347
and her perception of time itself.

00:01:24.347 --> 00:01:27.537
The only people who could notice time
on the moving spaceship

00:01:27.537 --> 00:01:29.237
passing slower for Stella

00:01:29.237 --> 00:01:33.807
would be observers in an inertial, 
or non-accelerating, reference frame–

00:01:33.807 --> 00:01:35.794
like Terra back on Earth.

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:39.074
Thus, Terra concludes that when they meet
back on Earth,

00:01:39.074 --> 00:01:41.234
she’ll be older than Stella.

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:43.734
But that’s just one way of 
looking at things.

00:01:43.734 --> 00:01:45.613
Because all movement is relative,

00:01:45.613 --> 00:01:50.653
Stella argues it would be just as valid to
say her spaceship will stand still

00:01:50.653 --> 00:01:55.132
while the rest of the universe, 
including Terra, moves around her.

00:01:55.132 --> 00:01:59.212
And in that case, time will pass twice as 
slowly for Terra,

00:01:59.212 --> 00:02:02.006
making Stella the older twin in the end.

00:02:02.006 --> 00:02:06.006
They can’t each be older than the other, 
so which one of them is right?

00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:09.956
This apparent contradiction is known as
the “Twin Paradox.”

00:02:09.956 --> 00:02:11.616
But it’s not really a paradox–

00:02:11.616 --> 00:02:16.606
just an example of how special relativity 
can be easily misunderstood.

00:02:16.606 --> 00:02:18.916
To test their theories in real-time,

00:02:18.916 --> 00:02:22.306
each of the twins agrees to send 
a burst of light to the other

00:02:22.306 --> 00:02:24.726
every time a year has passed for them.

00:02:24.726 --> 00:02:28.056
Unlike other objects, the speed of light 
is always constant

00:02:28.056 --> 00:02:30.736
regardless of an observer’s 
reference frame.

00:02:30.736 --> 00:02:34.036
A light burst sent from Earth will be 
measured at the same speed

00:02:34.036 --> 00:02:36.236
as a light burst sent from the spaceship,

00:02:36.236 --> 00:02:39.946
regardless of whether it’s on its 
outbound or return trip.

00:02:39.946 --> 00:02:42.446
So when one twin observes 
a burst of light,

00:02:42.446 --> 00:02:46.716
they’re measuring how long it took the 
other twin to experience a year passing,

00:02:46.716 --> 00:02:49.751
plus how long it took for light 
to travel between them.

00:02:49.751 --> 00:02:52.361
We can track what’s happening on a graph.

00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:57.701
The X axis marks distance from Earth, 
and the Y axis tracks the passage of time.

00:02:57.701 --> 00:03:01.780
From Terra’s perspective, her path will 
simply be a vertical line,

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.420
with distance equal to zero

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.500
and each tick on the line equivalent 
to a year as she perceives it.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.794
Stella’s path will stretch from the same 
origin to a point 11.5 years in time

00:03:12.794 --> 00:03:15.688
and 10 light-years in distance from Terra…

00:03:15.688 --> 00:03:20.048
before converging again at zero 
distance and 23 years’ time.

00:03:20.048 --> 00:03:21.977
At her first one-year mark,

00:03:21.977 --> 00:03:26.237
Terra will send a pulse of light from 
Earth towards Stella’s spaceship.

00:03:26.237 --> 00:03:29.074
Since light takes a year to travel 
one light-year,

00:03:29.074 --> 00:03:32.354
its path will be a 45-degree 
diagonal line.

00:03:32.354 --> 00:03:34.784
And because Stella is 
traveling away from it,

00:03:34.784 --> 00:03:36.724
by the time the light catches up to her,

00:03:36.724 --> 00:03:41.534
over 7 total years will have passed for
Terra, and over 4 for Stella.

00:03:41.534 --> 00:03:44.766
By the time Stella observes 
Terra’s second burst,

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:47.466
she will already be on her return journey.

00:03:47.466 --> 00:03:50.626
But now, since she’s moving towards the 
source of the light,

00:03:50.626 --> 00:03:52.706
it will take less time to reach her,

00:03:52.706 --> 00:03:55.226
and she’ll observe the bursts 
more frequently.

00:03:55.226 --> 00:03:58.266
This means that Stella observes Terra 
aging slowly

00:03:58.266 --> 00:03:59.886
for the first half of her journey,

00:03:59.886 --> 00:04:02.826
but aging rapidly during the return half.

00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:06.414
Meanwhile for Stella, it seems as though 
Terra, the destination star,

00:04:06.414 --> 00:04:08.944
and the whole universe are 
moving around her.

00:04:08.944 --> 00:04:10.674
And because of length contraction,

00:04:10.674 --> 00:04:15.104
Stella observes the distance between 
them shrinking by a factor of 2.

00:04:15.104 --> 00:04:19.129
This means each leg of the trip will only 
take about six years

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:20.769
from Stella’s perspective.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.879
When she sends the first signal to Earth, 
two years will have passed for Terra.

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:28.592
Stella will send four more light bursts 
during her outbound journey,

00:04:28.592 --> 00:04:30.532
each one from farther away.

00:04:30.532 --> 00:04:34.952
By the time Terra observes the first pulse
from Stella's inbound journey,

00:04:34.952 --> 00:04:38.018
over 21 years will have passed for her.

00:04:38.018 --> 00:04:40.238
For the rest of Stella's return home,

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:43.758
Terra receives multiple light 
bursts each year.

00:04:43.758 --> 00:04:49.808
Thus, Terra observes Stella aging slowly 
for about 90% of their 23 years apart,

00:04:49.808 --> 00:04:52.777
and aging rapidly during the last 10%.

00:04:52.777 --> 00:04:56.867
This asymmetry accounts for why the 
paradox isn’t really a paradox.

00:04:56.867 --> 00:04:58.955
Although each twin witnesses time

00:04:58.955 --> 00:05:01.795
both speeding up and slowing 
down for the other,

00:05:01.795 --> 00:05:03.885
Stella sees an even split,

00:05:03.885 --> 00:05:08.085
while Terra sees Stella aging slowly for 
most of the time they’re apart.

00:05:08.085 --> 00:05:11.842
This is consistent with each twin’s 
measurement of the space voyage,

00:05:11.842 --> 00:05:17.482
which takes 23 Earth years, but only 
11.5 as experienced aboard the ship.

00:05:17.482 --> 00:05:23.262
When the twins are reunited, Terra will be
43 years old, while Stella will be 31.

00:05:23.262 --> 00:05:24.384
Where Stella went wrong

00:05:24.384 --> 00:05:29.454
was her assumption that she and Terra had
equal claim to being inertial observers.

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:34.248
To be an inertial observer, one has to 
maintain a constant speed and direction

00:05:34.248 --> 00:05:36.694
relative to the rest of the universe.

00:05:36.694 --> 00:05:41.144
Terra was at rest the entire time, 
so her velocity was a constant zero.

00:05:41.144 --> 00:05:44.059
But when Stella changed her direction 
for the return journey,

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:48.019
she entered a different reference frame 
from the one she’d started in.

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:52.309
Terra and Stella now both have a better
understanding of how spacetime works.

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:55.299
And as twins who are eleven 
years apart in age,

00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:58.779
they’re a perfect example 
of special relativity.
