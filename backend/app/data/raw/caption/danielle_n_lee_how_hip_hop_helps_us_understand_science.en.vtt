00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:14.221
How y'all doing?

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:16.111
Good.

00:00:16.135 --> 00:00:18.920
I came here to give you a science lesson

00:00:18.944 --> 00:00:21.006
about animal mating systems

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.614
and why defining monogamy
has been a challenge for scientists.

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:29.046
But you won't need a textbook
or to download an online lecture.

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.283
All you'll simply need to do
is revisit the song "OPP"

00:00:34.307 --> 00:00:35.712
by Naughty by Nature.

00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:36.926
(Laughter)

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.211
It was released in 1991.

00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:43.493
Now, "OPP" is a call-and-response song.

00:00:43.815 --> 00:00:47.649
So throughout the talk,
I'm going to put lyrics up on the screen,

00:00:47.673 --> 00:00:49.063
and I'm going to recite some

00:00:49.087 --> 00:00:50.450
and I'm going to prompt you

00:00:50.474 --> 00:00:52.644
when it's your turn
to do the response, OK?

00:00:52.668 --> 00:00:53.921
(Cheers)

00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:56.580
Now, I know some people
in this audience know this song,

00:00:56.604 --> 00:00:59.429
so I need you to lead the way
with the tempo and the rhythm,

00:00:59.453 --> 00:01:00.857
if that's alright, OK?

00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:02.071
Right, y'all ready?

00:01:02.974 --> 00:01:04.321
You down with OPP?

00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:05.712
Audience: Yeah, you know me!

00:01:05.736 --> 00:01:07.119
DNL: You down with OPP?

00:01:07.143 --> 00:01:08.498
Audience: Yeah, you know me!

00:01:08.522 --> 00:01:09.777
DNL: You down with OPP?

00:01:09.791 --> 00:01:11.133
Audience: Yeah, you know me!

00:01:11.157 --> 00:01:12.355
DNL: That was perfect.

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:13.529
Thank you.

00:01:14.768 --> 00:01:16.450
"OPP, how can I explain it?

00:01:16.474 --> 00:01:17.982
I'll take it frame by frame it.

00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:20.045
To have y'all jumping shout and singing it

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:22.823
O is for other, P is for people.
scratch your temple.

00:01:22.847 --> 00:01:25.355
The last P, well, that's not that simple."

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:29.069
Now, in the song, the MC hints
that it's a five-letter word,

00:01:29.093 --> 00:01:30.704
but to keep it rated PG,

00:01:30.728 --> 00:01:33.553
he simply refers to it as "property."

00:01:33.983 --> 00:01:35.133
(Laughter)

00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:38.466
The song is about cheating
on your significant other.

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:42.633
Now, around the time that this song
was in heavy rotation,

00:01:42.657 --> 00:01:47.974
biologists were in deep discussion
about whether bird species,

00:01:47.998 --> 00:01:53.246
notably songbirds and waterfowl
were actually monogamous or not.

00:01:53.831 --> 00:01:57.117
See, for decades,
generations of science students

00:01:57.141 --> 00:02:01.131
were taught that well over 90 percent
of the bird species were monogamous.

00:02:01.657 --> 00:02:04.723
A male and female
mating faithfully for life.

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:07.672
That was until the late 1980s,

00:02:07.696 --> 00:02:10.490
when a new laboratory technique
came on the scene,

00:02:10.514 --> 00:02:14.522
which could copy DNA
from a small tissue or fluid sample

00:02:14.546 --> 00:02:16.641
and decode the genetics of individuals.

00:02:17.046 --> 00:02:19.109
Now, before that technique,

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:21.378
we were never ever certain about,

00:02:21.402 --> 00:02:24.245
100 percent, who the parents
of baby birds were.

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:26.482
All we had were our field notes.

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:29.164
And we would know
which adults lived in a nest

00:02:29.188 --> 00:02:31.323
and which ones fed the baby birds.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:37.704
Well, come to find out,
study after study kept coming in

00:02:37.728 --> 00:02:41.286
and we found so much
evidence of infidelity --

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.658
(Laughter)

00:02:42.682 --> 00:02:44.048
among bird species,

00:02:44.072 --> 00:02:45.463
particularly these songbirds

00:02:45.487 --> 00:02:48.075
that we thought
were the pinnacle of monogamy.

00:02:48.445 --> 00:02:51.783
It would have made Maury Povich
jealous for the ratings.

00:02:51.807 --> 00:02:54.180
(Laughter)

00:02:54.538 --> 00:02:57.831
It rocked biology and ornithology so hard,

00:02:57.855 --> 00:03:02.053
we had to modify and expand
the entire definition of monogamy.

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:06.657
Now, it was so bad
that this was the headline

00:03:06.681 --> 00:03:09.172
of the "New York Times" science section,

00:03:09.196 --> 00:03:10.958
August, 1990.

00:03:11.427 --> 00:03:14.381
"Mating for Life?
It's not for the Birds or the Bees."

00:03:14.405 --> 00:03:16.237
(Laughter)

00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:19.173
We had to come up with new definitions.

00:03:19.538 --> 00:03:23.204
The situation where an individual
would change partners,

00:03:23.228 --> 00:03:25.057
either between breeding seasons

00:03:25.081 --> 00:03:28.394
or just simply because
they didn't like their partner anymore?

00:03:28.418 --> 00:03:30.618
We now call this "serial monogamy."

00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:35.791
(Laughter)

00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:37.894
I didn't know it was
going to be this funny.

00:03:37.918 --> 00:03:39.865
(Laughter)

00:03:40.283 --> 00:03:44.783
The situation where we know
the male and female pair together

00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:47.355
and all the babies
belong to both partners?

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.346
We call that "genetic monogamy."

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.815
And we now recognize
that it only holds true

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:55.966
for about 14 percent
of the songbird species,

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.070
which we were very certain
were truly monogamous.

00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:01.569
And with this reclassification,

00:04:01.593 --> 00:04:04.343
we realized that in a lot
of those field observations

00:04:04.367 --> 00:04:07.481
where we saw a male and female
sharing a nest,

00:04:07.505 --> 00:04:12.021
comaintaining a territory,
even provisioning offspring together,

00:04:12.045 --> 00:04:16.560
often included a few baby birds
that did not belong to the male partner.

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:20.288
We call this "social monogamy."

00:04:20.312 --> 00:04:22.732
(Laughter)

00:04:22.756 --> 00:04:25.066
And the mechanism responsible?

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.557
Extra-pair copulation.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.370
"It's OPP, time for other people's
what you get it

00:04:32.394 --> 00:04:35.206
there's no room for relationship,
there's just room to ..."

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.381
Audience: "Hit it!"

00:04:36.405 --> 00:04:39.234
"How many brothers out there
know just what I'm getting at?

00:04:39.258 --> 00:04:42.404
Who thinks it's wrong because I was
splitting and cohitting that.

00:04:42.754 --> 00:04:45.785
Well if you do, that's OPP"

00:04:46.238 --> 00:04:47.777
Actually, that's EPC

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.572
Which is the abbreviation
for extra-pair copulation.

00:04:52.596 --> 00:04:54.888
(Laughter)

00:04:54.912 --> 00:04:59.720
Now, we define extra-pair copulation
as the mating outside of a pair bond.

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:02.434
And just like we were
discovering via science,

00:05:02.458 --> 00:05:06.085
it can lead to babies
that don't belong to the male partner.

00:05:06.109 --> 00:05:07.264
Alright?

00:05:07.288 --> 00:05:10.942
Now, I first learned
about EPCs years later,

00:05:10.966 --> 00:05:14.029
after all the science news broke
while I was in graduate school.

00:05:14.403 --> 00:05:16.703
And as we were taking a class,

00:05:16.727 --> 00:05:19.601
talking about current discoveries
and mating systems,

00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:21.403
this topic comes up.

00:05:21.855 --> 00:05:24.459
And as my professor's
going through the definition

00:05:24.483 --> 00:05:27.292
and recounting all
the dramatic turns of events

00:05:27.316 --> 00:05:29.482
that lead to these new revelations,

00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:33.109
I'm sitting in class and a familiar song
starts bopping in my head.

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:34.768
I'm like, "You down with OPP?

00:05:34.792 --> 00:05:36.323
Yeah, you know me!"

00:05:36.347 --> 00:05:37.966
(Laughter)

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.799
I mean, that's exactly
what that song was about:

00:05:41.823 --> 00:05:42.973
EPCs.

00:05:43.355 --> 00:05:45.182
And what I recognized

00:05:45.206 --> 00:05:48.847
is that this gives us an opportunity
to revisit this song.

00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:50.671
Let's switch the lyrics up.

00:05:51.815 --> 00:05:53.569
So say EPC.

00:05:53.593 --> 00:05:54.751
Audience: EPC.

00:05:54.775 --> 00:05:56.289
DNL: Say it, EPC!

00:05:56.313 --> 00:05:57.464
Audience: EPC!

00:05:57.488 --> 00:05:58.855
"I like to say it with pride

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:01.855
now, when you do it, do it well,
and make sure that it counts.

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:03.498
You're not down with a discount."

00:06:03.522 --> 00:06:04.720
You down with EPC?

00:06:04.744 --> 00:06:08.026
Audience: Yeah, you know me!

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.534
Now, I had always been
playing songs in my head

00:06:11.558 --> 00:06:13.534
while I was in science class,

00:06:13.558 --> 00:06:17.136
kind of tapping into this index
of pop culture and hip-hop songs.

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:20.871
But when I would share my analogies
with my science professors,

00:06:20.895 --> 00:06:22.823
all of whom were older white men,

00:06:22.847 --> 00:06:27.585
I often got blank and confused
stares as responses.

00:06:27.609 --> 00:06:29.792
(Laughter)

00:06:29.816 --> 00:06:33.712
But when I would share this
with people from communities like mine,

00:06:33.736 --> 00:06:36.950
or other colleagues --
so, diverse communities --

00:06:36.974 --> 00:06:39.441
this hip-hop science remix was a hit.

00:06:39.871 --> 00:06:43.537
That's because I was either talking
to people who looked and sounded like me,

00:06:43.561 --> 00:06:46.967
or at the very least, you know,
listened to some of the same songs.

00:06:46.991 --> 00:06:49.791
We were sharing a common cultural lexicon.

00:06:50.346 --> 00:06:54.768
And with that lexicon, I was able
to bring new science terms to them,

00:06:54.792 --> 00:07:00.653
and together, we were sharing a new
comprehension of science for the culture.

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:05.745
Now, hip-hop song references

00:07:05.769 --> 00:07:11.880
are a really good tool for teaching
content to students from hip-hop culture

00:07:11.904 --> 00:07:13.333
or urban communities.

00:07:13.357 --> 00:07:16.537
And I use it intentionally
to connect to those students,

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:19.823
tapping into vocabulary
that they already know

00:07:19.847 --> 00:07:22.580
and systems that they already comprehend.

00:07:23.228 --> 00:07:29.748
And what it does in that process
is it ratifies them, us, our culture

00:07:29.772 --> 00:07:31.557
as knowledge purveyors.

00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:36.077
I use hip-hop to frame
and communicate science

00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:40.601
because I'm intentionally communicating
science to broader audiences

00:07:40.625 --> 00:07:45.315
that public science outreach
has traditionally overlooked.

00:07:46.427 --> 00:07:48.316
And in the process,

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.308
I am affirming the genius

00:07:51.332 --> 00:07:55.347
that thrives in the young minds of people
from every hood everywhere.

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:57.966
So let me ask you one last time,

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.395
you down with EPC?

00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:00.776
Audience: Yeah, you know me!

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.057
DNL: You down with EPC?

00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:03.420
Audience: Yeah, you know me!

00:08:03.444 --> 00:08:04.646
DNL: You down with EPC?

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.030
Audience: Yeah, you know me!

00:08:06.054 --> 00:08:07.262
DNL: Who's down with EPC?

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:09.362
Audience: All the homies!

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:10.864
Thank you.

00:08:10.888 --> 00:08:15.277
(Applause and cheers)
