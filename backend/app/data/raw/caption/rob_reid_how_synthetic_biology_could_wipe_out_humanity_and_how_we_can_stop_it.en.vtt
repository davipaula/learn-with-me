00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:15.928
So, there's about
seven and a half billion of us.

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:20.506
The World Health Organization tells us
that 300 million of us are depressed,

00:00:21.214 --> 00:00:24.089
and about 800,000 people
take their lives every year.

00:00:24.803 --> 00:00:28.877
A tiny subset of them choose
a profoundly nihilistic route,

00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:33.116
which is they die in the act of killing
as many people as possible.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.479
These are some famous recent examples.

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.052
And here's a less famous one.
It happened about nine weeks ago.

00:00:39.076 --> 00:00:40.268
If you don't remember it,

00:00:40.292 --> 00:00:42.374
it's because there's
a lot of this going on.

00:00:42.398 --> 00:00:47.079
Wikipedia just last year
counted 323 mass shootings

00:00:47.103 --> 00:00:50.084
in my home country, the United States.

00:00:50.108 --> 00:00:52.322
Not all of those shooters were suicidal,

00:00:52.346 --> 00:00:55.142
not all of them were maximizing
their death tolls,

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.396
but many, many were.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.544
An important question becomes:
What limits do these people have?

00:01:00.568 --> 00:01:02.074
Take the Vegas shooter.

00:01:02.098 --> 00:01:04.976
He slaughtered 58 people.

00:01:05.342 --> 00:01:07.444
Did he stop there because he'd had enough?

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:13.445
No, and we know this because
he shot and injured another 422 people

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:15.763
who he surely would have
preferred to kill.

00:01:16.283 --> 00:01:19.023
We have no reason to think
he would have stopped at 4,200.

00:01:19.047 --> 00:01:23.005
In fact, with somebody this nihilistic,
he may well have gladly killed us all.

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:24.221
We don't know.

00:01:24.953 --> 00:01:27.000
What we do know is this:

00:01:27.024 --> 00:01:30.443
when suicidal murderers really go all in,

00:01:30.467 --> 00:01:33.403
technology is the force multiplier.

00:01:33.843 --> 00:01:35.253
Here's an example.

00:01:35.277 --> 00:01:40.276
Several years back, there was a rash
of 10 mass school attacks in China

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.002
carried out with things
like knives and hammers and cleavers,

00:01:44.026 --> 00:01:46.073
because guns are really hard to get there.

00:01:46.097 --> 00:01:50.084
By macabre coincidence,
this last attack occurred

00:01:50.108 --> 00:01:54.001
just hours before the massacre
in Newtown, Connecticut.

00:01:54.025 --> 00:01:58.407
But that one American attack killed
roughly the same number of victims

00:01:58.431 --> 00:02:01.352
as the 10 Chinese attacks combined.

00:02:01.376 --> 00:02:07.249
So we can fairly say,
knife: terrible; gun: way worse.

00:02:07.273 --> 00:02:09.986
And airplane: massively worse,

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.217
as pilot Andreas Lubitz showed
when he forced 149 people

00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:16.257
to join him in his suicide,

00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:18.619
smashing a plane into the French Alps.

00:02:19.046 --> 00:02:21.832
And there are other examples of this.

00:02:21.856 --> 00:02:26.904
And I'm afraid there are far more deadly
weapons in our near future than airplanes,

00:02:26.928 --> 00:02:28.531
ones not made of metal.

00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:34.247
So let's consider the apocalyptic
dynamics that will ensue

00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:39.145
if suicidal mass murder hitches a ride
on a rapidly advancing field

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:42.973
that for the most part holds
boundless promise for society.

00:02:43.606 --> 00:02:46.666
Somewhere out there in the world,
there's a tiny group of people

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.291
who would attempt, however ineptly,

00:02:49.315 --> 00:02:52.093
to kill us all if they
could just figure out how.

00:02:52.736 --> 00:02:55.435
The Vegas shooter may or may not
have been one of them,

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.416
but with seven and a half billion of us,

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.874
this is a nonzero population.

00:02:59.898 --> 00:03:02.142
There's plenty of suicidal
nihilists out there.

00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:03.361
We've already seen that.

00:03:03.385 --> 00:03:07.089
There's people with severe mood disorders
that they can't even control.

00:03:07.113 --> 00:03:12.481
There are people who have just suffered
deranging traumas, etc. etc.

00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:14.649
As for the corollary group,

00:03:14.673 --> 00:03:19.375
its size was simply zero forever
until the Cold War,

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:22.227
when suddenly, the leaders
of two global alliances

00:03:22.251 --> 00:03:24.797
attained the ability to blow up the world.

00:03:26.043 --> 00:03:29.556
The number of people
with actual doomsday buttons

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.224
has stayed fairly stable since then.

00:03:32.248 --> 00:03:34.433
But I'm afraid it's about to grow,

00:03:34.457 --> 00:03:36.055
and not just to three.

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.497
This is going off the charts.

00:03:37.521 --> 00:03:40.122
I mean, it's going to look
like a tech business plan.

00:03:40.146 --> 00:03:42.298
(Laughter)

00:03:44.264 --> 00:03:45.928
And the reason is,

00:03:45.952 --> 00:03:48.292
we're in the era
of exponential technologies,

00:03:48.316 --> 00:03:53.103
which routinely take
eternal impossibilities

00:03:53.127 --> 00:03:58.936
and make them the actual superpowers
of one or two living geniuses

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.743
and -- this is the big part --

00:04:00.767 --> 00:04:03.425
then diffuse those powers
to more or less everybody.

00:04:03.853 --> 00:04:05.521
Now, here's a benign example.

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:10.191
If you wanted to play checkers
with a computer in 1952,

00:04:10.215 --> 00:04:13.698
you literally had to be that guy,

00:04:13.722 --> 00:04:18.707
then commandeer one of the world's
19 copies of that computer,

00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:22.357
then used your Nobel-adjacent brain
to teach it checkers.

00:04:22.381 --> 00:04:23.599
That was the bar.

00:04:24.869 --> 00:04:29.561
Today, you just need to know someone
who knows someone who owns a telephone,

00:04:29.585 --> 00:04:32.780
because computing
is an exponential technology.

00:04:33.243 --> 00:04:35.257
So is synthetic biology,

00:04:35.281 --> 00:04:37.389
which I'll now refer to as "synbio."

00:04:38.006 --> 00:04:43.696
And in 2011, a couple of researchers
did something every bit as ingenious

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.826
and unprecedented as the checkers trick

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.641
with H5N1 flu.

00:04:49.435 --> 00:04:54.091
This is a strain that kills
up to 60 percent of the people it infects,

00:04:54.115 --> 00:04:55.810
more than Ebola.

00:04:55.834 --> 00:04:58.504
But it is so uncontagious

00:04:58.528 --> 00:05:02.548
that it's killed fewer
than 50 people since 2015.

00:05:02.572 --> 00:05:06.635
So these researchers edited H5N1's genome

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:11.251
and made it every bit as deadly,
but also wildly contagious.

00:05:11.275 --> 00:05:14.624
The news arm of one of the world's
top two scientific journals

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:18.465
said if this thing got out,
it would likely cause a pandemic

00:05:18.489 --> 00:05:20.753
with perhaps millions of deaths.

00:05:20.777 --> 00:05:22.646
And Dr. Paul Keim said

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.619
he could not think of an organism
as scary as this,

00:05:26.643 --> 00:05:29.742
which is the last thing
I personally want to hear

00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:34.241
from the Chairman of the National
Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity.

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:37.583
And by the way, Dr. Keim also said this --

00:05:37.607 --> 00:05:40.409
["I don't think anthrax
is scary at all compared to this."]

00:05:40.433 --> 00:05:41.738
And he's also one of these.

00:05:41.762 --> 00:05:43.092
[Anthrax expert] (Laughter)

00:05:43.116 --> 00:05:46.717
Now, the good news about the 2011 biohack

00:05:46.741 --> 00:05:49.804
is that the people who did it
didn't mean us any harm.

00:05:49.828 --> 00:05:51.020
They're virologists.

00:05:51.044 --> 00:05:53.211
They believed they were advancing science.

00:05:53.235 --> 00:05:56.978
The bad news is that technology
does not freeze in place,

00:05:57.002 --> 00:05:59.030
and over the next few decades,

00:05:59.054 --> 00:06:02.132
their feat will become trivially easy.

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:06.399
In fact, it's already way easier,
because as we learned yesterday morning,

00:06:06.423 --> 00:06:08.377
just two years after they did their work,

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:11.905
the CRISPR system was harnessed
for genome editing.

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:13.833
This was a radical breakthrough

00:06:13.857 --> 00:06:17.135
that makes gene editing
massively easier --

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:20.313
so easy that CRISPR
is now taught in high schools.

00:06:20.825 --> 00:06:24.125
And this stuff is moving
quicker than computing.

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:27.260
That slow, stodgy white line up there?

00:06:27.284 --> 00:06:29.542
That's Moore's law.

00:06:29.566 --> 00:06:33.346
That shows us how quickly
computing is getting cheaper.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.403
That steep, crazy-fun green line,

00:06:36.427 --> 00:06:40.491
that shows us how quickly
genetic sequencing is getting cheaper.

00:06:40.515 --> 00:06:44.113
Now, gene editing
and synthesis and sequencing,

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:46.940
they're different disciplines,
but they're tightly related.

00:06:46.964 --> 00:06:49.213
And they're all moving
in these headlong rates.

00:06:49.237 --> 00:06:52.964
And the keys to the kingdom
are these tiny, tiny data files.

00:06:52.988 --> 00:06:56.896
That is an excerpt of H5N1's genome.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.823
The whole thing can fit
on just a few pages.

00:06:59.847 --> 00:07:03.056
And yeah, don't worry, you can Google this
as soon as you get home.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.814
It's all over the internet, right?

00:07:04.838 --> 00:07:06.772
And the part that made it contagious

00:07:06.796 --> 00:07:09.130
could well fit on a single Post-it note.

00:07:09.154 --> 00:07:13.151
And once a genius makes a data file,

00:07:13.175 --> 00:07:15.502
any idiot can copy it,

00:07:15.526 --> 00:07:17.547
distribute it worldwide

00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:19.207
or print it.

00:07:19.231 --> 00:07:21.923
And I don't just mean print it on this,

00:07:21.947 --> 00:07:24.502
but soon enough, on this.

00:07:24.993 --> 00:07:26.896
So let's imagine a scenario.

00:07:27.287 --> 00:07:30.623
Let's say it's 2026,
to pick an arbitrary year,

00:07:30.647 --> 00:07:33.623
and a brilliant virologist,
hoping to advance science

00:07:33.647 --> 00:07:35.953
and better understand pandemics,

00:07:35.977 --> 00:07:37.473
designs a new bug.

00:07:37.957 --> 00:07:40.111
It's as contagious as chicken pox,

00:07:40.135 --> 00:07:42.055
it's as deadly as Ebola,

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:46.087
and it incubates for months and months
before causing an outbreak,

00:07:46.111 --> 00:07:50.326
so the whole world can be infected
before the first sign of trouble.

00:07:50.707 --> 00:07:53.218
Then, her university gets hacked.

00:07:53.242 --> 00:07:55.664
And of course,
this is not science fiction.

00:07:55.688 --> 00:07:57.874
In fact, just one recent US indictment

00:07:57.898 --> 00:08:01.268
documents the hacking
of over 300 universities.

00:08:01.996 --> 00:08:07.517
So that file with the bug's genome on it
spreads to the internet's dark corners.

00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:11.194
And once a file is out there,
it never comes back --

00:08:11.218 --> 00:08:15.401
just ask anybody who runs
a movie studio or a music label.

00:08:16.001 --> 00:08:18.973
So now maybe in 2026,

00:08:18.997 --> 00:08:21.202
it would take a true genius
like our virologist

00:08:21.226 --> 00:08:23.847
to make the actual living critter,

00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:25.797
but 15 years later,

00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:29.414
it may just take a DNA printer
you can find at any high school.

00:08:29.883 --> 00:08:31.065
And if not?

00:08:31.514 --> 00:08:33.462
Give it a couple of decades.

00:08:34.248 --> 00:08:36.658
So, a quick aside:

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:37.924
Remember this slide here?

00:08:37.948 --> 00:08:40.267
Turn your attention to these two words.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:47.120
If somebody tries this
and is only 0.1 percent effective,

00:08:47.144 --> 00:08:48.947
eight million people die.

00:08:48.971 --> 00:08:52.610
That's 2,500 9/11s.

00:08:52.634 --> 00:08:55.040
Civilization would survive,

00:08:55.064 --> 00:08:57.850
but it would be permanently disfigured.

00:08:58.586 --> 00:09:01.736
So this means we need
to be concerned about anybody

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.884
who has the faintest shot on goal,

00:09:03.908 --> 00:09:05.775
not just geniuses.

00:09:06.688 --> 00:09:11.735
So today, there's a tiny
handful of geniuses

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:13.901
who probably could make a doomsday bug

00:09:13.925 --> 00:09:17.044
that's .1-percent effective
and maybe even a little bit more.

00:09:17.068 --> 00:09:22.073
They tend to be stable and successful
and so not part of this group.

00:09:22.097 --> 00:09:25.370
So I guess I'm sorta kinda
barely OK-ish with that.

00:09:26.307 --> 00:09:29.179
But what about after technology improves

00:09:29.203 --> 00:09:30.783
and diffuses

00:09:30.807 --> 00:09:34.134
and thousands of life science
grad students are enabled?

00:09:34.158 --> 00:09:37.706
Are every single one of them
going to be perfectly stable?

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.554
Or how about a few years after that,

00:09:39.578 --> 00:09:43.287
where every stress-ridden
premed is fully enabled?

00:09:43.311 --> 00:09:45.203
At some point in that time frame,

00:09:45.227 --> 00:09:47.548
these circles are going to intersect,

00:09:47.572 --> 00:09:51.052
because we're now starting to talk about
hundreds of thousands of people

00:09:51.076 --> 00:09:52.235
throughout the world.

00:09:52.259 --> 00:09:56.317
And they recently included that guy
who dressed up like the Joker

00:09:56.341 --> 00:09:59.593
and shot 12 people to death
at a Batman premiere.

00:09:59.617 --> 00:10:01.764
That was a neuroscience PhD student

00:10:01.788 --> 00:10:03.700
with an NIH grant.

00:10:05.478 --> 00:10:07.004
OK, plot twist:

00:10:07.028 --> 00:10:11.923
I think we can actually survive this one
if we start focusing on it now.

00:10:11.947 --> 00:10:14.917
And I say this, having spent
countless hours

00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:17.913
interviewing global leaders in synbio

00:10:17.937 --> 00:10:21.971
and also researching their work
for science podcasts I create.

00:10:21.995 --> 00:10:27.133
I have come to fear their work, in case
I haven't gotten that out there yet --

00:10:27.157 --> 00:10:28.705
(Laughter)

00:10:28.729 --> 00:10:32.077
but more than that,
to revere its potential.

00:10:32.101 --> 00:10:35.955
This stuff will cure cancer,
heal our environment

00:10:35.979 --> 00:10:39.280
and stop our cruel treatment
of other creatures.

00:10:39.942 --> 00:10:43.612
So how do we get all this without,
you know, annihilating ourselves?

00:10:44.091 --> 00:10:47.922
First thing: like it or not,
synbio is here,

00:10:47.946 --> 00:10:49.840
so let's embrace the technology.

00:10:49.864 --> 00:10:51.721
If we do a tech ban,

00:10:51.745 --> 00:10:54.902
that would only hand
the wheel to bad actors.

00:10:54.926 --> 00:10:57.282
Unlike nuclear programs,

00:10:57.306 --> 00:10:59.762
biology can be practiced invisibly.

00:10:59.786 --> 00:11:03.143
Massive Soviet cheating
on bioweapons treaties

00:11:03.167 --> 00:11:07.296
made that very clear, as does every
illegal drug lab in the world.

00:11:07.825 --> 00:11:10.049
Secondly, enlist the experts.

00:11:10.073 --> 00:11:12.081
Let's sign them up and make more of them.

00:11:12.105 --> 00:11:14.723
For every million and one
bioengineers we have,

00:11:14.747 --> 00:11:18.432
at least a million of them
are going to be on our side.

00:11:18.858 --> 00:11:21.679
I mean, Al Capone
would be on our side in this one.

00:11:21.703 --> 00:11:24.513
The bar to being a good guy
is just so low.

00:11:25.386 --> 00:11:28.667
And massive numerical
advantages do matter,

00:11:28.691 --> 00:11:31.580
even when a single bad guy
can inflict grievous harm,

00:11:31.604 --> 00:11:33.179
because among many other things,

00:11:33.203 --> 00:11:35.719
they allow us to exploit
the hell out of this:

00:11:35.743 --> 00:11:41.665
we have years and hopefully decades
to prepare and prevent.

00:11:41.689 --> 00:11:45.177
The first person to try something awful --
and there will be somebody --

00:11:45.201 --> 00:11:46.462
may not even be born yet.

00:11:47.068 --> 00:11:50.593
Next, this needs to be an effort
that spans society,

00:11:50.617 --> 00:11:53.391
and all of you need to be a part of it,

00:11:53.415 --> 00:11:57.585
because we cannot ask
a tiny group of experts

00:11:57.609 --> 00:12:02.747
to be responsible for both containing
and exploiting synthetic biology,

00:12:02.771 --> 00:12:05.893
because we already tried that
with the financial system,

00:12:05.917 --> 00:12:09.431
and our stewards became
massively corrupted

00:12:09.455 --> 00:12:11.701
as they figured out
how they could cut corners,

00:12:11.725 --> 00:12:14.736
inflict massive, massive risks
on the rest of us

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.677
and privatize the gains,

00:12:16.701 --> 00:12:18.768
becoming repulsively wealthy

00:12:18.792 --> 00:12:21.426
while they stuck us
with the $22 trillion bill.

00:12:22.723 --> 00:12:24.190
And more recently --

00:12:24.214 --> 00:12:26.444
(Applause)

00:12:26.468 --> 00:12:29.181
Are you the ones who have gotten
the thank-you letters?

00:12:29.205 --> 00:12:30.503
I'm still waiting for mine.

00:12:30.527 --> 00:12:33.283
I just figured they were
too busy to be grateful.

00:12:33.307 --> 00:12:35.243
And much more recently,

00:12:36.291 --> 00:12:39.603
online privacy started looming
as a huge issue,

00:12:39.627 --> 00:12:41.573
and we basically outsourced it.

00:12:41.597 --> 00:12:42.944
And once again:

00:12:42.968 --> 00:12:45.526
privatized gains, socialized losses.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.615
Is anybody else sick of this pattern?

00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:52.262
(Applause)

00:12:52.286 --> 00:12:58.245
So we need a more inclusive way
to safeguard our prosperity,

00:12:58.269 --> 00:12:59.426
our privacy

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.216
and soon, our lives.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.978
So how do we do all of this?

00:13:04.002 --> 00:13:06.670
Well, when bodies fight pathogens,

00:13:06.694 --> 00:13:09.092
they use ingenious immune systems,

00:13:09.116 --> 00:13:11.161
which are very complex and multilayered.

00:13:11.185 --> 00:13:14.123
Why don't we build one of these
for the whole damn ecosystem?

00:13:14.147 --> 00:13:17.815
There's a year of TED Talks that could
be given on this first critical layer.

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:21.319
So these are just a couple
of many great ideas that are out there.

00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:23.329
Some R and D muscle

00:13:23.353 --> 00:13:28.288
could take the very primitive
pathogen sensors that we currently have

00:13:28.312 --> 00:13:31.135
and put them on a very steep
price performance curve

00:13:31.159 --> 00:13:33.289
that would quickly become ingenious

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:34.467
and networked

00:13:34.491 --> 00:13:38.819
and gradually as widespread
as smoke detectors and even smartphones.

00:13:38.843 --> 00:13:40.810
On a very related note:

00:13:40.834 --> 00:13:43.461
vaccines have all kinds of problems

00:13:43.485 --> 00:13:46.506
when it comes to manufacturing
and distribution,

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:51.085
and once they're made, they can't adapt
to new threats or mutations.

00:13:51.109 --> 00:13:53.928
We need an agile biomanufacturing base

00:13:53.952 --> 00:13:58.042
extending into every single pharmacy
and maybe even our homes.

00:13:58.066 --> 00:14:01.725
Printer technology for vaccines
and medicines is within reach

00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:03.732
if we prioritize it.

00:14:03.756 --> 00:14:05.826
Next, mental health.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.705
Many people who commit
suicidal mass murder

00:14:08.729 --> 00:14:13.213
suffer from crippling,
treatment-resistant depression or PTSD.

00:14:13.237 --> 00:14:17.308
We need noble researchers
like Rick Doblin working on this,

00:14:17.332 --> 00:14:21.270
but we also need the selfish jerks
who are way more numerous

00:14:21.294 --> 00:14:27.314
to appreciate the fact that acute
suffering will soon endanger all of us,

00:14:27.338 --> 00:14:29.068
not just those afflicted.

00:14:29.092 --> 00:14:32.542
Those jerks will then
join us and Al Capone

00:14:32.566 --> 00:14:34.820
in fighting this condition.

00:14:35.409 --> 00:14:41.027
Third, each and every one of us
can be and should be a white blood cell

00:14:41.051 --> 00:14:42.901
in this immune system.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.755
Suicidal mass murderers
can be despicable, yes,

00:14:46.779 --> 00:14:50.888
but they're also terribly
broken and sad people,

00:14:50.912 --> 00:14:53.332
and those of us who aren't
need to do what we can

00:14:53.356 --> 00:14:55.443
to make sure nobody goes unloved.

00:14:56.573 --> 00:15:01.257
(Applause)

00:15:01.711 --> 00:15:04.280
Next, we need to make
fighting these dangers

00:15:04.304 --> 00:15:07.064
core to the discipline
of synthetic biology.

00:15:07.088 --> 00:15:09.455
There are companies out there
that at least claim

00:15:09.479 --> 00:15:12.381
they let their engineers
spend 20 percent of their time

00:15:12.405 --> 00:15:13.799
doing whatever they want.

00:15:13.823 --> 00:15:16.475
What if those who hire bioengineers

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:17.667
and become them

00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:21.572
give 20 percent of their time
to building defenses for the common good?

00:15:23.397 --> 00:15:24.768
Not a bad idea, right?

00:15:24.792 --> 00:15:26.010
(Applause)

00:15:26.034 --> 00:15:28.674
Then, finally: this won't be any fun.

00:15:28.698 --> 00:15:32.645
But we need to let our minds
go to some very, very dark places,

00:15:32.669 --> 00:15:36.081
and thank you for letting me
take you there this evening.

00:15:36.105 --> 00:15:38.472
We survived the Cold War

00:15:38.496 --> 00:15:42.849
because every one of us understood
and respected the danger,

00:15:42.873 --> 00:15:45.260
in part, because we had spent decades

00:15:45.284 --> 00:15:47.761
telling ourselves terrifying ghost stories

00:15:47.785 --> 00:15:49.745
with names like "Dr. Strangelove"

00:15:49.769 --> 00:15:51.384
and "War Games."

00:15:51.408 --> 00:15:53.704
This is no time to remain calm.

00:15:53.728 --> 00:15:56.796
This is one of those rare times
when it's incredibly productive

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.478
to freak the hell out --

00:15:59.502 --> 00:16:02.271
(Laughter)

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:04.392
to come up with some ghost stories

00:16:04.416 --> 00:16:09.281
and use our fear as fuel
to fight this danger.

00:16:09.771 --> 00:16:13.825
Because, all these
terrible scenarios I've painted --

00:16:13.849 --> 00:16:15.758
they are not destiny.

00:16:16.171 --> 00:16:17.528
They're optional.

00:16:18.012 --> 00:16:21.619
The danger is still kind of distant.

00:16:22.247 --> 00:16:25.010
And that means it will only befall us

00:16:25.034 --> 00:16:27.222
if we allow it to.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:29.144
Let's not.

00:16:29.168 --> 00:16:30.884
Thank you very much for listening.

00:16:30.908 --> 00:16:35.460
(Applause)
