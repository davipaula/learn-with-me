Kashmir Hill: So for my
birthday last year,

00:00:15.071 --> 00:00:17.064
my husband got me an Amazon Echo.

00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:19.135
I was kind of shocked, actually,

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:22.393
because we both work
in privacy and security.

00:00:22.417 --> 00:00:23.753
(Laughter)

00:00:24.688 --> 00:00:28.077
And this was a device that would sit
in the middle of our home

00:00:28.101 --> 00:00:29.537
with a microphone on,

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:31.210
constantly listening.

00:00:31.696 --> 00:00:32.950
We're not alone, though.

00:00:32.974 --> 00:00:35.855
According to a survey by NPR
and Edison Research,

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.958
one in six American adults
now has a smart speaker,

00:00:39.982 --> 00:00:42.863
which means that they have
a virtual assistant at home.

00:00:42.887 --> 00:00:44.085
Like, that's wild.

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:48.225
The future, or the future dystopia,
is getting here fast.

00:00:48.778 --> 00:00:53.285
Beyond that, companies are offering us
all kinds of internet-connected devices.

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.277
There are smart lights, smart locks,
smart toilets, smart toys,

00:00:58.301 --> 00:00:59.612
smart sex toys.

00:01:00.323 --> 00:01:03.014
Being smart means the device
can connect to the internet,

00:01:03.038 --> 00:01:04.214
it can gather data,

00:01:04.238 --> 00:01:06.140
and it can talk to its owner.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.680
But once your appliances can talk to you,

00:01:09.704 --> 00:01:11.849
who else are they going to be talking to?

00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:13.696
I wanted to find out,

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.108
so I went all-in and turned my
one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco

00:01:17.132 --> 00:01:18.481
into a smart home.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.891
I even connected our bed to the internet.

00:01:22.505 --> 00:01:25.807
As far as I know, it was just
measuring our sleeping habits.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.571
I can now tell you
that the only thing worse

00:01:28.595 --> 00:01:30.382
than getting a terrible night's sleep

00:01:30.406 --> 00:01:32.823
is to have your smart bed
tell you the next day

00:01:32.847 --> 00:01:35.903
that you "missed your goal
and got a low sleep score."

00:01:35.927 --> 00:01:37.307
(Laughter)

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:38.768
It's like, "Thanks, smart bed.

00:01:38.792 --> 00:01:41.308
As if I didn't already
feel like shit today."

00:01:41.332 --> 00:01:42.485
(Laughter)

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.045
All together, I installed 18
internet-connected devices in my home.

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:49.307
I also installed a Surya.

00:01:49.331 --> 00:01:50.712
Surya Mattu: Hi, I'm Surya.

00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:51.934
(Laughter)

00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:54.902
I monitored everything the smart home did.

00:01:54.926 --> 00:01:58.855
I built a special router that let me look
at all the network activity.

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:01.809
You can think of my router
sort of like a security guard,

00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:03.966
compulsively logging
all the network packets

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.037
as they entered and left the smart home.

00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:08.815
KH: Surya and I are both journalists,
he's not my husband,

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:10.515
we just work together at Gizmodo.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:11.928
SM: Thank you for clarifying.

00:02:11.952 --> 00:02:13.354
The devices Kashmir bought --

00:02:13.378 --> 00:02:15.070
we were interested in understanding

00:02:15.094 --> 00:02:17.205
what they were saying
to their manufacturers.

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:19.291
But we were also interested
in understanding

00:02:19.315 --> 00:02:21.685
what the home's digital
emissions look like

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.974
to the internet service provider.

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:26.840
We were seeing what the ISP could see,
but more importantly,

00:02:26.864 --> 00:02:28.045
what they could sell.

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.212
KH: We ran the experiment for two months.

00:02:30.236 --> 00:02:31.403
In that two months,

00:02:31.427 --> 00:02:34.304
there wasn't a single hour
of digital silence in the house --

00:02:34.328 --> 00:02:36.260
not even when we went away for a week.

00:02:36.284 --> 00:02:37.458
SM: Yeah, it's so true.

00:02:37.482 --> 00:02:40.498
Based on the data, I knew when
you guys woke up and went to bed.

00:02:40.522 --> 00:02:42.561
I even knew when Kashmir
brushed her teeth.

00:02:42.585 --> 00:02:44.609
I'm not going to out your brushing habits,

00:02:44.633 --> 00:02:48.262
but let's just say it was very clear to me
when you were working from home.

00:02:48.286 --> 00:02:51.498
KH: Uh, I think you just outed them
to, like, a lot of people here.

00:02:51.522 --> 00:02:53.868
SM: Don't be embarrassed,
it's just metadata.

00:02:54.472 --> 00:02:57.615
I knew when you turned on your TV
and how long you watched it for.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.268
Fun fact about the Hill household:

00:02:59.292 --> 00:03:01.086
they don't watch a lot of television,

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.378
but when they do,
it's usually in binge mode.

00:03:03.402 --> 00:03:06.181
Favorite shows include
"Difficult People" and "Party Down."

00:03:06.205 --> 00:03:08.244
KH: OK, you're right,
I loved "Party Down."

00:03:08.268 --> 00:03:10.815
It's a great show,
and you should definitely watch it.

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:13.283
But "Difficult People"
was all my husband, Trevor.

00:03:13.307 --> 00:03:16.910
And Trevor was actually a little upset
that you knew about his binges,

00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:20.268
because even though he'd been the one
to connect the TV to the router,

00:03:20.292 --> 00:03:22.739
he forgot that the TV was watching us.

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.402
It's actually not the first time
that our TV has spied on us.

00:03:26.426 --> 00:03:28.125
The company that made it, VIZIO,

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:32.482
paid a 2.2 million-dollar settlement
to the government just last year,

00:03:32.506 --> 00:03:35.863
because it had been collecting
second-by-second information

00:03:35.887 --> 00:03:39.355
about what millions of people
were watching on TV, including us,

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:43.084
and then it was selling that information
to data brokers and advertisers.

00:03:43.108 --> 00:03:46.330
SM: Ah, classic surveillance economy move.

00:03:46.775 --> 00:03:50.641
The devices Kashmir bought
almost all pinged their servers daily.

00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:53.061
But do you know which device
was especially chatty?

00:03:53.085 --> 00:03:54.379
The Amazon Echo.

00:03:54.403 --> 00:03:56.831
It contacted its servers
every three minutes,

00:03:56.855 --> 00:03:59.053
regardless of whether
you were using it or not.

00:03:59.077 --> 00:04:01.260
KH: In general, it was disconcerting

00:04:01.284 --> 00:04:04.268
that all these devices were having
ongoing conversations

00:04:04.292 --> 00:04:05.918
that were invisible to me.

00:04:05.942 --> 00:04:08.529
I mean, I would have had
no idea, without your router.

00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:12.021
If you buy a smart device,
you should probably know --

00:04:12.045 --> 00:04:14.156
you're going to own the device,

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.600
but in general, the company
is going to own your data.

00:04:17.624 --> 00:04:20.196
And you know, I mean,
maybe that's to be expected --

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.727
you buy an internet-connected device,
it's going to use the internet.

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:26.031
But it's strange to have these devices

00:04:26.055 --> 00:04:28.713
moving into the intimate space
that is the home

00:04:28.737 --> 00:04:32.180
and allowing companies to track
our really basic behavior there.

00:04:32.204 --> 00:04:33.363
SM: So true.

00:04:33.387 --> 00:04:36.926
Even the most banal-seeming data
can be mined by the surveillance economy.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.525
For example, who cares
how often you brush your teeth?

00:04:39.549 --> 00:04:43.075
Well, as it turns out, there's a dental
insurance company called Beam.

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.934
They've been monitoring their customers'
smart toothbrushes since 2015 --

00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:49.537
for discounts on their
premiums, of course.

00:04:49.561 --> 00:04:51.820
KH: We know what
some of you are thinking:

00:04:51.844 --> 00:04:54.498
this is the contract of the modern world.

00:04:54.522 --> 00:04:55.949
You give up a little privacy,

00:04:55.973 --> 00:04:59.191
and you get some convenience
or some price breaks in return.

00:04:59.514 --> 00:05:01.855
But that wasn't my experience
in my smart home.

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:05.553
It wasn't convenient, it was infuriating.

00:05:05.577 --> 00:05:08.069
I'll admit, I love my smart vacuum,

00:05:08.093 --> 00:05:10.498
but many other things in the house
drove me insane:

00:05:10.522 --> 00:05:12.918
we ran out of electrical outlets,

00:05:12.942 --> 00:05:16.321
and I had to download
over a dozen apps to my phone

00:05:16.345 --> 00:05:17.672
to control everything.

00:05:17.696 --> 00:05:19.785
And then every device had its own log-in,

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:22.172
my toothbrush had a password ...

00:05:22.196 --> 00:05:23.933
(Laughter)

00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:28.085
And smart coffee, especially,
was just a world of hell.

00:05:28.109 --> 00:05:32.037
SM: Wait, really? Cloud-powered
coffee wasn't really working for you?

00:05:32.061 --> 00:05:35.299
KH: I mean, maybe I'm naive,
but I thought it was going to be great.

00:05:35.323 --> 00:05:39.342
I thought we'd just wake up in the morning
and we'd say, "Alexa, make us coffee."

00:05:39.366 --> 00:05:41.239
But that's not how it went down.

00:05:41.263 --> 00:05:45.914
We had to use this really particular,
brand-specific phrase to make it work.

00:05:45.938 --> 00:05:50.546
It was, "Alexa, ask the Behmor
to run quick start."

00:05:51.222 --> 00:05:54.564
And this was just, like,
really hard to remember

00:05:54.588 --> 00:05:55.922
first thing in the morning,

00:05:55.946 --> 00:05:57.649
before you have had your caffeine.

00:05:57.673 --> 00:05:58.776
(Laughter)

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.490
And apparently, it was hard to say,

00:06:00.514 --> 00:06:03.577
because the Echo Dot
that was right next to our bed

00:06:03.601 --> 00:06:05.212
just couldn't understand us.

00:06:05.704 --> 00:06:10.325
So we would basically start every day
by screaming this phrase at the Echo Dot.

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:11.522
(Laughter)

00:06:11.546 --> 00:06:13.012
And Trevor hated this.

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:15.087
He'd be like, "Please, Kashmir,

00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:18.780
just let me go to the kitchen and push
the button to make the coffee run."

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.466
And I'd be like, "No, you can't!

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.899
We have to do it the smart way!"

00:06:23.923 --> 00:06:25.839
(Laughter)

00:06:25.863 --> 00:06:28.906
I'm happy to report that our marriage
survived the experiment,

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.490
but just barely.

00:06:30.514 --> 00:06:32.561
SM: If you decide to make your home smart,

00:06:32.585 --> 00:06:35.434
hopefully, you’ll find it
less infuriating than Kashmir did.

00:06:35.458 --> 00:06:37.545
But regardless, the smart things you buy

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:40.664
can and probably are used
to target and profile you.

00:06:41.141 --> 00:06:44.181
Just the number of devices you have
can be used to predict

00:06:44.205 --> 00:06:45.627
how rich or poor you are.

00:06:45.651 --> 00:06:48.418
Facebook's made this tech,
and they've also patented it.

00:06:48.442 --> 00:06:52.128
KH: All the anxiety you currently feel
every time you go online,

00:06:52.152 --> 00:06:53.458
about being tracked,

00:06:53.482 --> 00:06:55.783
is about to move into your living room.

00:06:55.807 --> 00:06:57.386
Or into your bedroom.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.172
There's this sex toy called the We-Vibe.

00:07:00.577 --> 00:07:03.244
You might wonder why
a sex toy connects to the internet,

00:07:03.268 --> 00:07:06.704
but it's for two people
who are in a long-distance relationship,

00:07:06.728 --> 00:07:09.648
so they can share their love from afar.

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:12.375
Some hackers took a close look at this toy

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:14.474
and saw it was sending
a lot of information

00:07:14.498 --> 00:07:16.960
back to the company that made it --

00:07:16.984 --> 00:07:19.950
when it was used,
how long it was used for,

00:07:19.974 --> 00:07:23.680
what the vibration settings were,
how hot the toy got.

00:07:23.704 --> 00:07:25.893
It was all going into a database.

00:07:25.917 --> 00:07:28.666
So I reached out to the company,

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.992
and I said, "Why are you collecting
this really sensitive data?"

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:35.755
And they said, "Well, it's great
for market research."

00:07:36.592 --> 00:07:39.521
But they were data-mining
their customers' orgasms.

00:07:39.545 --> 00:07:41.466
And they weren't telling them about it.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.712
I mean, even if
you're cavalier about privacy,

00:07:43.736 --> 00:07:46.331
I hope that you would admit
that's a step too far.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.188
SM: This is why I want
to keep my sex toys dumb.

00:07:49.212 --> 00:07:50.378
KH: That's great.

00:07:50.402 --> 00:07:52.068
We're all very glad to know that.

00:07:52.092 --> 00:07:53.540
(Laughter)

00:07:53.564 --> 00:07:55.598
SM: A data point I'm willing to share.

00:07:55.622 --> 00:07:57.345
(Laughter)

00:07:57.369 --> 00:08:00.339
The devices Kashmir bought
range from useful to annoying.

00:08:00.363 --> 00:08:02.156
But the thing they all had in common

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.879
was sharing data with
the companies that made them.

00:08:04.903 --> 00:08:07.211
With email service providers
and social media,

00:08:07.235 --> 00:08:10.193
we've long been told that if it's free,
you're the product.

00:08:10.217 --> 00:08:12.224
But with the internet of things, it seems,

00:08:12.248 --> 00:08:14.256
even if you pay, you're still the product.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.525
So you really have to ask:

00:08:15.549 --> 00:08:17.734
Who's the true beneficiary
of your smart home,

00:08:17.758 --> 00:08:19.387
you or the company mining you?

00:08:19.411 --> 00:08:21.363
KH: Look, we're a tech savvy crowd here.

00:08:21.387 --> 00:08:24.499
I think most of us know
that these things connect to the internet

00:08:24.523 --> 00:08:25.686
and send data out.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:29.728
And fine, maybe you're OK with living
in that commercial panopticon,

00:08:29.752 --> 00:08:31.149
but others aren't.

00:08:31.173 --> 00:08:34.014
We need the companies to rethink
the design of these devices

00:08:34.038 --> 00:08:35.553
with our privacy in mind,

00:08:35.577 --> 00:08:38.688
because we're not all willing
to participate in "market research,"

00:08:38.712 --> 00:08:41.605
just because a device we bought
has a Wi-Fi connection.

00:08:42.014 --> 00:08:43.212
And I have to tell you,

00:08:43.236 --> 00:08:45.818
even when you're aware,
generally, this is happening,

00:08:45.842 --> 00:08:50.236
it's really easy to forget that normal
household items are spying on you.

00:08:50.664 --> 00:08:53.014
It's easy to forget
these things are watching you,

00:08:53.038 --> 00:08:55.085
because they don't look like cameras.

00:08:55.109 --> 00:08:56.538
They could look like ...

00:08:56.562 --> 00:08:59.106
well, they could look like a dildo.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:00.932
Thank you.

00:09:00.956 --> 00:09:04.642
(Applause)
