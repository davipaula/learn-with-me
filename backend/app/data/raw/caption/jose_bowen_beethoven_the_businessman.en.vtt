00:00:34.018 --> 00:00:37.494
This was the first title I thought of for this talk,

00:00:37.494 --> 00:00:39.943
"Beethoven as Bill Gates". Does that make sense?

00:00:39.943 --> 00:00:43.183
Maybe not, OK, so think about that.

00:00:43.183 --> 00:00:47.419
Being an educator, I am going to tell you the story,

00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:50.725
and then you'll figure it out for yourselves.

00:00:50.725 --> 00:00:55.360
So the second thought I had was that I would tell the story

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.464
of the history of music delivery.

00:00:57.464 --> 00:01:01.756
Literally, from the beginning, from pounding rocks to pounding rock.

00:01:01.756 --> 00:01:05.713
So the good news about this is the first 10,000 years,

00:01:05.713 --> 00:01:11.791
just sailed by, so for 10,000 years if you want to make music

00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:16.538
you literally pick up rocks, later instruments, those sorts of things.

00:01:16.538 --> 00:01:18.611
This goes on for a very long time.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:22.309
Gradually in the West, mostly we start to get a performing class,

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:25.553
people who were experts, who were really good at pounding rocks.

00:01:25.553 --> 00:01:29.391
So, by the 18th century, we're still basically doing this.

00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:32.253
We have a class of experts, professionals,

00:01:32.253 --> 00:01:34.447
who play very expensive instruments, for the most part,

00:01:34.447 --> 00:01:36.933
things like the organ, complicated instruments,

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:39.774
and if you wanted to hear music in the 18th century,

00:01:39.774 --> 00:01:43.150
it was live. You had to go to a concert.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.502
You had to go to church, you had to go to a civic event,

00:01:45.502 --> 00:01:48.575
you had to go hear somebody making music live.

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:50.662
So, music always involved social interaction.

00:01:50.662 --> 00:01:52.568
There were no headphones you could put on,

00:01:52.568 --> 00:01:54.901
there was no iPhone, there was no record player.

00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:58.310
If you wanted to hear music you had to get out of the house.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.552
There's really, basically, no music in your house.

00:02:01.552 --> 00:02:04.606
So this goes on through the 18th century from the beginning,

00:02:04.606 --> 00:02:08.437
and then we have our first disruption.

00:02:08.437 --> 00:02:11.851
So these two things actually happened together, these two disruptions.

00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:14.333
We get the piano, right?

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:17.742
The piano was a new technology

00:02:17.742 --> 00:02:20.135
that really starts to happen in the 18th century,

00:02:20.135 --> 00:02:21.591
and then it becomes something that

00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:24.369
you could mass produce cheaply.

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:26.971
So you can now have an instrument that's not too expensive,

00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:28.519
that everyone can have one,

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.166
that you can have at home.

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:32.481
So this allows for a kind of disruption,

00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:34.304
but it wouldn't have happened if the second

00:02:34.304 --> 00:02:36.465
disruption hadn't happened at the same time,

00:02:36.465 --> 00:02:38.287
which is that somebody figured out

00:02:38.287 --> 00:02:40.184
how to do cheap music printing.

00:02:40.184 --> 00:02:42.862
Remember Gutenberg and the other kind of printing.

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:44.310
Music is a little more complicated.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.917
It took a little longer to figure out

00:02:45.917 --> 00:02:48.589
how do I create a cheap way to distribute sheet music?

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:51.634
So in London, at the time of the American revolution,

00:02:51.634 --> 00:02:54.178
there are 12 music shops.

00:02:54.178 --> 00:02:57.152
By 1800, there are 30.

00:02:57.152 --> 00:03:00.922
By 1820 there are 150.

00:03:00.922 --> 00:03:05.169
So, the Internet wasn't the first time that's happened.

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:08.139
Because think about what happens when, all of a sudden,

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.560
you go from -- if I wanted to hear music,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.769
I've got to go hear Bach, I've got to go hear Mozart.

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.302
That meant you had to actually go hear Mozart.

00:03:16.302 --> 00:03:19.578
You didn't by a CD of Mozart, you didn't download Mozart,

00:03:19.578 --> 00:03:21.891
you couldn't even buy Mozart sheet music,

00:03:21.891 --> 00:03:23.874
at least not easily or cheaply.

00:03:23.874 --> 00:03:25.688
But if you wanted to hear Mozart or Bach,

00:03:25.688 --> 00:03:28.862
you had to go to Germany and go hear them.

00:03:28.862 --> 00:03:30.729
But that's not true for Beethoven.

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:34.359
And Beethoven figures out that in fact there's a new market.

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.689
Beethoven is an entrepreneur,

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:38.369
not unlike our other friend, Bill Gates.

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:40.665
He's an entrepreneur that figures out, "Hey, I can sell,

00:03:40.665 --> 00:03:43.090
I don't have to actually go to London.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.422
I can actually just sell sheet music.

00:03:45.422 --> 00:03:47.844
And it can be printed, and mass distributed,

00:03:47.844 --> 00:03:49.288
and I will be famous everywhere.

00:03:49.288 --> 00:03:51.194
Everybody else will play my music."

00:03:51.194 --> 00:03:54.208
So that changes the experience of music for everybody.

00:03:54.208 --> 00:03:56.449
It changes the variety, it changes the global pyramid,

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:58.906
it changes all sorts of things.

00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:00.871
It creates a new class of musicians,

00:04:00.871 --> 00:04:04.076
of composers and performers, a division of labor.

00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:09.220
Bach, if you hire Bach to play for your wedding, guess who shows up?

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.776
Bach. That's what he does for a living, right?

00:04:12.776 --> 00:04:16.608
He has no way to expand his business.

00:04:16.608 --> 00:04:18.925
But Beethoven does. So then this happens again.

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:22.272
It happens 100 years later, so you're starting to see a theme.

00:04:22.272 --> 00:04:25.143
By the turn of the century it's an interesting time for music delivery.

00:04:25.153 --> 00:04:27.981
So 100 years later, we get the record player, the gramophone, the piano player.

00:04:27.981 --> 00:04:31.345
Now, instead of having to -- you could buy Rachmaninoff sheet music,

00:04:31.345 --> 00:04:33.704
but if you wanted to hear Rachmaninoff,

00:04:33.704 --> 00:04:36.195
you had to actually go to the concert hall.

00:04:36.195 --> 00:04:38.347
Not anymore. Now you can buy a record

00:04:38.347 --> 00:04:40.878
of Rachmaninoff, or you can buy a player piano,

00:04:40.878 --> 00:04:43.533
and a roll that fits into another kind of recording device.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:46.202
And later the radio. So think about this.

00:04:46.202 --> 00:04:50.643
You're a band in Texas, you're Doc Ross in Texas,

00:04:50.643 --> 00:04:53.955
and you got the Texas big band market, you got it nailed.

00:04:53.955 --> 00:04:57.455
And all of a sudden there's this little thing called radio.

00:04:57.455 --> 00:05:01.222
And now everybody can hear Count Basie and Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman.

00:05:01.222 --> 00:05:03.890
Man, the competition just sucks now.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.000
All of a sudden the competition has gone global,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.159
just like it does a hundred years later,

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:12.902
with the iPod, the Internet and digital files, and Garage Band,

00:05:12.902 --> 00:05:17.109
that do all of these things all over again.

00:05:17.109 --> 00:05:20.186
So now, maybe we can talk about these two guys.

00:05:20.186 --> 00:05:24.503
So first of all, both of these guys are entrepreneurs,

00:05:24.503 --> 00:05:28.488
but second of all, both of these guys are software designers.

00:05:28.488 --> 00:05:30.797
That's what Beethoven does.

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:35.187
He writes software that runs on that piece of hardware over there.

00:05:35.187 --> 00:05:37.749
That's a piece of hardware, that's a device that you can use,

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:39.721
if you have my piece of paper.

00:05:39.721 --> 00:05:41.600
If you have sheet music, does it sound good?

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.585
No, it's a piece of paper.

00:05:43.585 --> 00:05:47.109
It only makes music - it's like floppy disks, they weren't very useful.

00:05:47.109 --> 00:05:48.898
You can use them as coasters, I guess.

00:05:48.898 --> 00:05:50.470
But they're not very useful on their own.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.542
So both Beethoven and Bill Gates are software designers.

00:05:54.542 --> 00:05:57.368
So, what's interesting is that they also both live at a time

00:05:57.368 --> 00:06:01.201
where the hardware is changing very quickly.

00:06:01.201 --> 00:06:03.125
Those of you who are old enough to remember,

00:06:03.125 --> 00:06:06.435
go back to the '90s, go back to Windows whatever,

00:06:06.435 --> 00:06:09.976
and remember your joy and your love of Bill Gates,

00:06:09.976 --> 00:06:14.278
as every time a new software package came out,

00:06:14.278 --> 00:06:17.071
you had to get a new computer.

00:06:17.071 --> 00:06:19.257
So, guess what, when Beethoven started writing music,

00:06:19.257 --> 00:06:22.667
he had this instrument up on top, with 5 octaves.

00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:25.801
This one's bigger, it's got more pedals,

00:06:25.801 --> 00:06:27.788
it's louder, it can do more stuff.

00:06:27.788 --> 00:06:29.267
When Beethoven starts off,

00:06:29.267 --> 00:06:31.288
he doesn't have a piano that can do this.

00:06:31.288 --> 00:06:33.386
He actually just cannot do this. He can't go --

00:06:33.386 --> 00:06:35.249
(Musical chords)

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:36.727
Can't do that.

00:06:36.727 --> 00:06:40.482
So, in 1803 a French piano maker -

00:06:40.482 --> 00:06:42.480
now, think of how smart this is.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.785
If you're a piano maker,

00:06:45.785 --> 00:06:49.803
into whose hands do you want to get that piano?

00:06:49.803 --> 00:06:52.668
Composers. Artists who will use that technology

00:06:52.668 --> 00:06:55.400
and make everybody else have to adopt your technology.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.841
It's like sending Bill Gates your fastest, latest computer,

00:06:58.841 --> 00:07:02.790
'cause you know he'll use up all the memory. (Laughter)

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.370
So, in 1803 Erard sends Beethoven a new piano,

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.565
and it has more notes, and it can do that.

00:07:10.565 --> 00:07:14.084
So the first thing Beethoven does is, he writes a piece that can do that.

00:07:14.084 --> 00:07:16.935
So if you've got a German or a Viennese piano,

00:07:16.935 --> 00:07:21.110
or a British piano, it can't do that.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.303
So, what do you do?

00:07:23.303 --> 00:07:26.321
You've gone to the music store.

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:29.307
And you've bought the latest Beethoven piano sonata,

00:07:29.307 --> 00:07:31.969
and you take it home, and you've got a 5-octave piano,

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:34.924
that was the brand spanking new, latest technology last year.

00:07:34.924 --> 00:07:38.617
You start playing that new Beethoven piano song. What happens?

00:07:38.617 --> 00:07:42.369
Not enough notes! You run out of room.

00:07:42.369 --> 00:07:45.160
So, in fact, Beethoven has the same relationship

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.607
with his audience that Bill Gates does.

00:07:47.607 --> 00:07:49.793
He's a software producer,

00:07:49.793 --> 00:07:52.834
and he has to deal with the hardware.

00:07:52.834 --> 00:07:54.967
And what's interesting about this is that

00:07:54.967 --> 00:07:58.253
Beethoven was actually smarter than Bill Gates.

00:07:58.253 --> 00:08:00.646
So when Beethoven gets his new Erard piano,

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:02.814
he immediately starts writing his third piano concerto,

00:08:02.814 --> 00:08:06.520
he goes and he gives a concert, he writes and uses all those extra notes.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.953
But what does he do when he goes and he gives a concert?

00:08:08.953 --> 00:08:10.976
He has to take the piano with him.

00:08:10.976 --> 00:08:13.892
Because it's the only piano he has in Vienna that actually has those extra notes.

00:08:13.892 --> 00:08:16.362
So he plays the concerto on the piano. It's great.

00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:18.480
But he realizes, oh, wait,

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.937
not everybody has one of these latest things.

00:08:19.937 --> 00:08:24.057
So he publishes piano sonatas, he waits.

00:08:24.057 --> 00:08:26.778
He delays for the next 10 years, he still publishes

00:08:26.778 --> 00:08:29.499
piano sonatas that don't use the extra notes.

00:08:29.499 --> 00:08:31.054
He actually waits, because he's -- People think,

00:08:31.054 --> 00:08:35.471
everything you know about Beethoven, basically wrong.

00:08:35.471 --> 00:08:37.995
Beethoven was a very clever entrepreneur,

00:08:37.995 --> 00:08:39.936
so the music that he wrote for the popular market,

00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.909
not the pieces he was going to play himself,

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:43.979
but the piano sonatas, he limits himself

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:48.804
to the amount of keys that you have at home in

00:08:48.804 --> 00:08:52.185
some part of Southern Italy where you have last year's piano.

00:08:52.185 --> 00:08:58.106
So, what are the effects of these disruptions in music technology?

00:08:58.106 --> 00:09:00.534
How do composers, how do people respond?

00:09:00.534 --> 00:09:03.709
So we've had 3 of these things, and they really all worked the same way.

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:06.069
We started off with printing and the piano.

00:09:06.069 --> 00:09:10.436
So the very first thing that happens is, it redefines the product.

00:09:10.436 --> 00:09:12.846
So the product becomes sheet music,

00:09:12.846 --> 00:09:15.595
becomes a piece of paper that you can then take home.

00:09:15.595 --> 00:09:18.159
In the 20th Century it becomes a record,

00:09:18.159 --> 00:09:19.749
something that you then take home.

00:09:19.749 --> 00:09:21.586
In the 21st Century it becomes the digital files.

00:09:21.586 --> 00:09:24.726
The nature of the product changes.

00:09:24.726 --> 00:09:26.496
Second, there's a division of labor.

00:09:26.496 --> 00:09:28.938
If you want to hire, listen to Bach,

00:09:28.938 --> 00:09:30.427
you've got to go listen to Bach.

00:09:30.427 --> 00:09:32.126
There's no other way to do this.

00:09:32.126 --> 00:09:34.620
In the 20th century, in the 19th century,

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.359
we've got performers and we've got composers,

00:09:36.359 --> 00:09:38.792
people who do different things. We have listeners

00:09:38.792 --> 00:09:42.496
who can now manipulate music like you just saw.

00:09:42.496 --> 00:09:44.108
It changes expectations of quality.

00:09:44.108 --> 00:09:46.792
Once everybody's heard Count Basie and Benny Goodman,

00:09:46.792 --> 00:09:48.523
maybe you're not quite so happy

00:09:48.523 --> 00:09:50.479
with your local band as much anymore.

00:09:50.479 --> 00:09:54.344
You've now heard -- I want to go listen to Benny Goodman some more.

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:55.996
You have now a global market.

00:09:55.996 --> 00:09:59.570
You can hear things that you didn't use to hear.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.221
Every time this happens we take away some social interaction.

00:10:03.221 --> 00:10:06.293
With Beethoven, you can now play Beethoven at home.

00:10:06.293 --> 00:10:08.605
You can't play Mozart at home.

00:10:08.605 --> 00:10:11.302
But with Beethoven you can buy the sheet music, you can go home,

00:10:11.302 --> 00:10:13.220
you can close the door, and you can play the piano.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.878
And only you are there, right?

00:10:14.878 --> 00:10:16.753
Now you have headphones to do the same thing.

00:10:16.753 --> 00:10:20.628
With each of these disruptions, it changes the amount of social interaction.

00:10:20.628 --> 00:10:23.748
It's a new personalized experience each time.

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:25.730
I can play Beethoven the way I want to.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.578
I can play it faster, I can play it slower.

00:10:27.578 --> 00:10:30.656
I can actually personalize the experience now.

00:10:30.656 --> 00:10:33.361
There's more consumer choice, the marketplace gets bigger.

00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:36.973
The number of titles on sale on those music stores goes up.

00:10:36.973 --> 00:10:40.144
But there's also less choice, because on a Global Pyramid

00:10:40.144 --> 00:10:42.234
you can't always tell what you want.

00:10:42.234 --> 00:10:44.386
There's so much choice out there. How do you pick?

00:10:44.386 --> 00:10:48.648
And so marketing starts to come in and who is the flavor of the month?

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:50.715
There's one more thing that's not on the list.

00:10:50.715 --> 00:10:52.714
Piracy.

00:10:52.714 --> 00:10:56.205
One of Haydn and Chopin's biggest worries,

00:10:56.205 --> 00:10:59.983
is that people were going to write fake Chopin

00:10:59.983 --> 00:11:02.064
and put Chopin on it.

00:11:02.064 --> 00:11:04.453
And you think Chopin would have been comforted by the fact,

00:11:04.453 --> 00:11:08.742
Hey, 20% of the people who buy fake Chopin are more likely to go buy real Chopin.

00:11:08.742 --> 00:11:10.997
Well, I don't know. (Laughter)

00:11:10.997 --> 00:11:13.989
But Chopin, another clever entrepreneur, you know what he does?

00:11:13.989 --> 00:11:16.181
He publishes his music in Italy, in France,

00:11:16.181 --> 00:11:18.511
in Germany and in England on the same day,

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:20.026
because there's no international copyright.

00:11:20.026 --> 00:11:22.425
So he's got to have everything published on the same day.

00:11:22.425 --> 00:11:25.042
And he puts differences in every country.

00:11:25.042 --> 00:11:27.412
So if you're playing Chopin, the additions

00:11:27.412 --> 00:11:30.140
from different countries are different on purpose.

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.437
Because he want to be able to track who is a pirate.

00:11:33.437 --> 00:11:36.377
So, this wasn't something that Sony thought of.

00:11:36.377 --> 00:11:40.642
So, the question is, is this new technology,

00:11:40.642 --> 00:11:43.913
it makes more choice for more people, it makes it more global,

00:11:43.913 --> 00:11:46.757
but it also allows more piracy.

00:11:46.757 --> 00:11:50.939
It also allows for people to have a marketing filter.

00:11:50.939 --> 00:11:55.532
They have some way to interact that's not always direct.

00:11:55.532 --> 00:11:58.126
So the next time somebody says, you know,

00:11:58.126 --> 00:12:00.856
"Nothing like the Internet ever happened."

00:12:00.856 --> 00:12:03.555
Well, it's true, but these kinds of disruptions

00:12:03.555 --> 00:12:06.921
in music technology have happened before.

00:12:06.921 --> 00:12:09.025
And the model for these disruptions is the same

00:12:09.025 --> 00:12:11.363
as we see in other kinds of businesses.

00:12:11.363 --> 00:12:13.609
It changes the nature of the product.

00:12:13.609 --> 00:12:16.842
So if you're in book publishing, you thought you were

00:12:16.842 --> 00:12:20.067
in book publishing because of these things called books.

00:12:20.067 --> 00:12:22.538
Well, you can still sell novels without books.

00:12:22.538 --> 00:12:24.187
You can still be in the music business

00:12:24.187 --> 00:12:26.679
even though you're not in the record business.

00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:28.294
Because you were selling records only because

00:12:28.294 --> 00:12:31.101
that was the technology that you inherited.

00:12:31.101 --> 00:12:34.861
Newspaper business, dead. But journalism isn't dead.

00:12:34.861 --> 00:12:38.676
And finally, schools. School is the next big horizon,

00:12:38.676 --> 00:12:40.846
because, what are we in the business of?

00:12:40.846 --> 00:12:44.439
Schools used to be like buying gas or buying food.

00:12:44.439 --> 00:12:47.741
They had to have local entry points all over the place.

00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:51.212
But now, with the Internet, we have a different distribution system.

00:12:51.212 --> 00:12:54.835
And so schools have got to think about what we're selling.

00:12:54.835 --> 00:12:58.925
But I think that the face to face interaction, is not going to go away.

00:12:58.925 --> 00:13:01.255
There's still something of value here, as we've demonstrated today,

00:13:01.255 --> 00:13:03.465
because we're at this thing called TED,

00:13:03.465 --> 00:13:05.496
where we still want to get to know each other.

00:13:05.496 --> 00:13:07.011
Thank you very much.

00:13:07.011 --> 00:13:08.948
(Applause)
