00:00:13.944 --> 00:00:17.665
As a roboticist,
I get asked a lot of questions.

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.993
"When we will they start
serving me breakfast?"

00:00:21.049 --> 00:00:25.725
So I thought the future of robotics
would be looking more like us.

00:00:28.114 --> 00:00:29.788
I thought they would look like me,

00:00:29.812 --> 00:00:33.559
so I built eyes
that would simulate my eyes.

00:00:34.813 --> 00:00:39.869
I built fingers that are dextrous
enough to serve me ...

00:00:39.893 --> 00:00:41.083
baseballs.

00:00:43.837 --> 00:00:45.854
Classical robots like this

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:49.054
are built and become functional

00:00:49.078 --> 00:00:52.276
based on the fixed number
of joints and actuators.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.115
And this means their functionality
and shape are already fixed

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:58.970
at the moment of their conception.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.357
So even though this arm
has a really nice throw --

00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:04.812
it even hit the tripod at the end--

00:01:06.015 --> 00:01:09.178
it's not meant for cooking you
breakfast per se.

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:12.839
It's not really suited for scrambled eggs.

00:01:12.863 --> 00:01:17.188
So this was when I was hit
by a new vision of future robotics:

00:01:18.101 --> 00:01:19.861
the transformers.

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:23.536
They drive, they run, they fly,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.429
all depending on the ever-changing,
new environment and task at hand.

00:01:29.267 --> 00:01:31.048
To make this a reality,

00:01:31.072 --> 00:01:34.363
you really have to rethink
how robots are designed.

00:01:35.448 --> 00:01:39.462
So, imagine a robotic module
in a polygon shape

00:01:39.486 --> 00:01:41.565
and using that simple polygon shape

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:44.627
to reconstruct multiple different forms

00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:48.941
to create a new form of robot
for different tasks.

00:01:49.528 --> 00:01:53.231
In CG, computer graphics,
it's not any news --

00:01:53.255 --> 00:01:56.686
it's been done for a while, and that's how
most of the movies are made.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.580
But if you're trying to make a robot
that's physically moving,

00:02:00.604 --> 00:02:02.180
it's a completely new story.

00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:04.720
It's a completely new paradigm.

00:02:06.307 --> 00:02:08.100
But you've all done this.

00:02:09.434 --> 00:02:14.742
Who hasn't made a paper airplane,
paper boat, paper crane?

00:02:15.893 --> 00:02:19.737
Origami is a versatile
platform for designers.

00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:23.837
From a single sheet of paper,
you can make multiple shapes,

00:02:23.861 --> 00:02:27.255
and if you don't like it,
you unfold and fold back again.

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:33.963
Any 3D form can be made
from 2D surfaces by folding,

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:36.516
and this is proven mathematically.

00:02:38.555 --> 00:02:42.963
And imagine if you were to have
an intelligent sheet

00:02:42.987 --> 00:02:46.546
that can self-fold into any form it wants,

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.793
anytime.

00:02:48.322 --> 00:02:50.576
And that's what I've been working on.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.782
I call this robotic origami,

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:55.304
"robogami."

00:02:57.387 --> 00:03:00.907
This is our first robogami transformation

00:03:00.931 --> 00:03:04.240
that was made by me about 10 years ago.

00:03:04.264 --> 00:03:06.031
From a flat-sheeted robot,

00:03:06.055 --> 00:03:09.002
it turns into a pyramid
and back into a flat sheet

00:03:09.026 --> 00:03:11.799
and into a space shuttle.

00:03:12.822 --> 00:03:14.063
Quite cute.

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:21.659
Ten years later, with my group
of ninja origami robotic researchers --

00:03:21.683 --> 00:03:23.581
about 22 of them right now --

00:03:24.332 --> 00:03:27.740
we have a new generation of robogamis,

00:03:27.764 --> 00:03:31.075
and they're a little more effective
and they do more than that.

00:03:32.105 --> 00:03:35.388
So the new generation of robogamis
actually serve a purpose.

00:03:35.412 --> 00:03:40.611
For example, this one actually navigates
through different terrains autonomously.

00:03:40.635 --> 00:03:43.970
So when it's a dry
and flat land, it crawls.

00:03:46.256 --> 00:03:48.735
And if it meets sudden rough terrain,

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:49.996
it starts rolling.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.472
It does this -- it's the same robot --

00:03:52.496 --> 00:03:55.519
but depending on which terrain it meets,

00:03:55.543 --> 00:04:00.308
it activates a different sequence
of actuators that's on board.

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.739
And once it meets an obstacle,
it jumps over it.

00:04:07.485 --> 00:04:10.861
It does this by storing energy
in each of its legs

00:04:10.885 --> 00:04:14.761
and releasing it and catapulting
like a slingshot.

00:04:14.785 --> 00:04:16.672
And it even does gymnastics.

00:04:17.688 --> 00:04:18.859
Yay.

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:20.320
(Laughter)

00:04:20.828 --> 00:04:25.005
So I just showed you
what a single robogami can do.

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:27.814
Imagine what they can do as a group.

00:04:27.838 --> 00:04:31.860
They can join forces to tackle
more complex tasks.

00:04:31.884 --> 00:04:35.046
Each module, either active or passive,

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.637
we can assemble them
to create different shapes.

00:04:38.661 --> 00:04:41.410
Not only that, by controlling
the folding joints,

00:04:41.434 --> 00:04:45.982
we're able to create and attack
different tasks.

00:04:46.006 --> 00:04:49.181
The form is making new task space.

00:04:49.736 --> 00:04:53.575
And this time, what's most
important is the assembly.

00:04:54.192 --> 00:04:58.376
They need to autonomously
find each other in a different space,

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.690
attach and detach, depending on
the environment and task.

00:05:03.616 --> 00:05:05.675
And we can do this now.

00:05:06.412 --> 00:05:07.839
So what's next?

00:05:07.863 --> 00:05:09.173
Our imagination.

00:05:09.704 --> 00:05:12.105
This is a simulation
of what you can achieve

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:13.786
with this type of module.

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.982
We decided that we were going
to have a four-legged crawler

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.049
turn into a little dog
and make small gaits.

00:05:22.073 --> 00:05:25.907
With the same module, we can actually
make it do something else:

00:05:25.931 --> 00:05:29.349
a manipulator, a typical,
classical robotic task.

00:05:29.373 --> 00:05:32.072
So with a manipulator,
it can pick up an object.

00:05:32.096 --> 00:05:36.140
Of course, you can add more modules
to make the manipulator legs longer

00:05:36.164 --> 00:05:39.887
to attack or pick up objects
that are bigger or smaller,

00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:41.677
or even have a third arm.

00:05:43.545 --> 00:05:47.906
For robogamis, there's no
one fixed shape nor task.

00:05:48.628 --> 00:05:52.928
They can transform into anything,
anywhere, anytime.

00:05:54.408 --> 00:05:57.084
So how do you make them?

00:05:57.108 --> 00:06:02.425
The biggest technical challenge
of robogami is keeping them super thin,

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:03.600
flexible,

00:06:03.624 --> 00:06:05.838
but still remaining functional.

00:06:06.562 --> 00:06:10.374
They're composed of multiple layers
of circuits, motors,

00:06:10.398 --> 00:06:12.816
microcontrollers and sensors,

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.694
all in the single body,

00:06:14.718 --> 00:06:18.039
and when you control
individual folding joints,

00:06:18.063 --> 00:06:21.589
you'll be able to achieve
soft motions like that

00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:23.093
upon your command.

00:06:26.013 --> 00:06:30.872
Instead of being a single robot that is
specifically made for a single task,

00:06:30.896 --> 00:06:34.791
robogamis are optimized to do multi-tasks.

00:06:35.366 --> 00:06:37.123
And this is quite important

00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:40.978
for the difficult and unique
environments on the Earth

00:06:41.002 --> 00:06:43.967
as well as in space.

00:06:45.782 --> 00:06:48.956
Space is a perfect
environment for robogamis.

00:06:49.673 --> 00:06:53.806
You cannot afford to have
one robot for one task.

00:06:54.966 --> 00:06:58.302
Who knows how many tasks
you will encounter in space?

00:06:58.846 --> 00:07:05.805
What you want is a single robotic platform
that can transform to do multi-tasks.

00:07:07.188 --> 00:07:12.300
What we want is a deck
of thin robogami modules

00:07:12.324 --> 00:07:16.695
that can transform to do multiples
of performing tasks.

00:07:18.322 --> 00:07:21.532
And don't take my word for it,

00:07:21.556 --> 00:07:24.592
because the European Space Agency
and Swiss Space Center

00:07:24.616 --> 00:07:26.876
are sponsoring this exact concept.

00:07:27.562 --> 00:07:32.607
So here you see a couple of images
of reconfiguration of robogamis,

00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:36.409
exploring the foreign land
aboveground, on the surface,

00:07:36.433 --> 00:07:38.355
as well as digging into the surface.

00:07:39.117 --> 00:07:41.196
It's not just exploration.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.808
For astronauts, they need additional help,

00:07:43.832 --> 00:07:46.666
because you cannot afford
to bring interns up there, either.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:47.872
(Laughter)

00:07:48.357 --> 00:07:51.238
They have to do every tedious task.

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:52.480
They may be simple,

00:07:52.504 --> 00:07:54.115
but super interactive.

00:07:54.762 --> 00:07:58.174
So you need robots
to facilitate their experiments,

00:07:58.198 --> 00:08:00.509
assisting them with the communications

00:08:00.533 --> 00:08:05.785
and just docking onto surfaces to be
their third arm holding different tools.

00:08:07.245 --> 00:08:10.378
But how will they be able
to control robogamis, for example,

00:08:10.402 --> 00:08:11.955
outside the space station?

00:08:11.979 --> 00:08:16.016
In this case, I show a robogami
that is holding space debris.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.644
You can work with your vision
so that you can control them,

00:08:19.668 --> 00:08:24.130
but what would be better
is having the sensation of touch

00:08:24.154 --> 00:08:27.757
directly transported onto
the hands of the astronauts.

00:08:28.248 --> 00:08:30.671
And what you need is a haptic device,

00:08:30.695 --> 00:08:34.403
a haptic interface that recreates
the sensation of touch.

00:08:35.051 --> 00:08:37.575
And using robogamis, we can do this.

00:08:39.276 --> 00:08:43.424
This is the world's
smallest haptic interface

00:08:44.316 --> 00:08:49.505
that can recreate a sensation of touch
just underneath your fingertip.

00:08:50.104 --> 00:08:52.681
We do this by moving the robogami

00:08:52.705 --> 00:08:57.216
by microscopic and macroscopic
movements at the stage.

00:08:57.812 --> 00:09:01.442
And by having this, not only
will you be able to feel

00:09:01.466 --> 00:09:03.205
how big the object is,

00:09:03.229 --> 00:09:06.115
the roundness and the lines,

00:09:06.139 --> 00:09:09.702
but also the stiffness and the texture.

00:09:11.019 --> 00:09:15.008
Alex has this interface
just underneath his thumb,

00:09:15.032 --> 00:09:19.844
and if he were to use this
with VR goggles and hand controllers,

00:09:19.868 --> 00:09:23.497
now the virtual reality
is no longer virtual.

00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:25.789
It becomes a tangible reality.

00:09:28.529 --> 00:09:32.216
The blue ball, red ball
and black ball that he's looking at

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.706
is no longer differentiated by colors.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:40.041
Now it is a rubber blue ball,
sponge red ball and billiard black ball.

00:09:40.642 --> 00:09:42.352
This is now possible.

00:09:43.263 --> 00:09:44.465
Let me show you.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:50.319
This is really the first time
this is shown live

00:09:50.343 --> 00:09:53.189
in front of a public grand audience,

00:09:53.213 --> 00:09:55.041
so hopefully this works.

00:09:55.668 --> 00:09:59.969
So what you see here
is an atlas of anatomy

00:09:59.993 --> 00:10:02.786
and the robogami haptic interface.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.355
So, like all the other
reconfigurable robots,

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:06.554
it multitasks.

00:10:06.578 --> 00:10:08.601
Not only is it going to serve as a mouse,

00:10:08.625 --> 00:10:10.990
but also a haptic interface.

00:10:11.381 --> 00:10:15.155
So for example, we have a white background
where there is no object.

00:10:15.179 --> 00:10:17.231
That means there is nothing to feel,

00:10:17.255 --> 00:10:20.967
so we can have a very,
very flexible interface.

00:10:21.352 --> 00:10:24.504
Now, I use this as a mouse
to approach skin,

00:10:24.528 --> 00:10:25.791
a muscular arm,

00:10:25.815 --> 00:10:27.831
so now let's feel his biceps,

00:10:27.855 --> 00:10:29.343
or shoulders.

00:10:29.367 --> 00:10:32.377
So now you see
how much stiffer it becomes.

00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:33.772
Let's explore even more.

00:10:33.796 --> 00:10:36.706
Let's approach the ribcage.

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.292
And as soon as I move
on top of the ribcage

00:10:39.316 --> 00:10:41.601
and between the intercostal muscles,

00:10:41.625 --> 00:10:43.174
which is softer and harder,

00:10:43.198 --> 00:10:45.434
I can feel the difference
of the stiffness.

00:10:45.458 --> 00:10:46.784
Take my word for it.

00:10:46.808 --> 00:10:51.011
So now you see, it's much stiffer
in terms of the force

00:10:51.035 --> 00:10:52.880
it's giving back to my fingertip.

00:10:53.822 --> 00:10:57.800
So I showed you the surfaces
that aren't moving.

00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:01.377
How about if I were to approach
something that moves,

00:11:01.401 --> 00:11:03.468
for example, like a beating heart?

00:11:03.492 --> 00:11:04.887
What would I feel?

00:11:11.573 --> 00:11:17.719
(Applause)

00:11:19.158 --> 00:11:21.451
This can be your beating heart.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.620
This can actually be inside your pocket

00:11:25.644 --> 00:11:27.409
while you're shopping online.

00:11:28.361 --> 00:11:32.150
Now you'll be able to feel the difference
of the sweater that you're buying,

00:11:32.174 --> 00:11:33.396
how soft it is,

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.256
if it's actually cashmere or not,

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.336
or the bagel that you're trying to buy,

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.428
how hard it is or how crispy it is.

00:11:42.229 --> 00:11:43.965
This is now possible.

00:11:46.774 --> 00:11:52.586
The robotics technology is advancing
to be more personalized and adaptive,

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:55.714
to adapt to our everyday needs.

00:11:56.457 --> 00:12:00.082
This unique specie
of reconfigurable robotics

00:12:00.106 --> 00:12:06.084
is actually the platform to provide
this invisible, intuitive interface

00:12:06.108 --> 00:12:08.600
to meet our exact needs.

00:12:10.169 --> 00:12:14.175
These robots will no longer look like
the characters from the movies.

00:12:14.843 --> 00:12:18.691
Instead, they will be whatever
you want them to be.

00:12:19.223 --> 00:12:20.429
Thank you.

00:12:20.453 --> 00:12:24.051
