00:00:06.536 --> 00:00:08.565
Thank you.

00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:09.862
Thank you very much.

00:00:09.862 --> 00:00:11.501
It is bright.

00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:13.906
TED has already persuaded me

00:00:13.906 --> 00:00:16.333
to change my life in one small way

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:19.349
by persuading me to change the opening of my speech.

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.011
I love this idea of engagement.

00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:24.898
So, when you leave here today,

00:00:24.898 --> 00:00:28.682
I'm going to ask you to engage or re-engage

00:00:28.682 --> 00:00:31.615
with some of the most important people in your lives:

00:00:31.615 --> 00:00:33.660
your brothers and sisters.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.177
It can be a profoundly life-affirming thing to do,

00:00:37.177 --> 00:00:39.683
even if it isn't always easy.

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.491
This is a man named Elliot

00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:46.181
for whom things were very difficult.

00:00:46.181 --> 00:00:47.944
Elliot was a drunk.

00:00:47.944 --> 00:00:50.546
He spent most of his life

00:00:50.546 --> 00:00:54.711
battling alcoholism, depression, morphine addiction

00:00:54.711 --> 00:00:58.724
and that life ended when he was just 34 years old.

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:00.563
What made things harder for Elliot

00:01:00.563 --> 00:01:03.229
is that his last name was Roosevelt.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.949
And he could never quite get past the comparisons

00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:07.772
with his big brother Teddy

00:01:07.772 --> 00:01:11.543
for whom things always seem to come a little bit easier.

00:01:11.543 --> 00:01:14.352
It wasn't easy being Bobby, either.

00:01:14.352 --> 00:01:17.070
He was also the sibling of a president.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.972
But he adored his brother Jack.

00:01:18.972 --> 00:01:20.455
He fought for him,

00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:22.038
he worked for him.

00:01:22.038 --> 00:01:26.118
And when Jack died, he bled for him too.

00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:29.596
In the years that followed, Bobby would smile,

00:01:29.596 --> 00:01:31.671
but it seemed labored.

00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:33.202
He'd lose himself at his work,

00:01:33.202 --> 00:01:35.307
but it seemed tortured.

00:01:35.307 --> 00:01:38.678
Bobby's own death, so similar to John's,

00:01:38.678 --> 00:01:41.520
seems somehow fitting.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.192
John Kennedy was robbed of his young life.

00:01:44.192 --> 00:01:47.883
Bobby seemed almost to have been relieved of his.

00:01:47.883 --> 00:01:51.557
There maybe no relationship

00:01:51.557 --> 00:01:53.650
that effects us more profoundly,

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.938
that's closer, finer, harder,

00:01:56.938 --> 00:02:00.248
sweeter, happier, sadder,

00:02:00.248 --> 00:02:03.575
more filled with joy or fraught with wow

00:02:03.575 --> 00:02:07.250
than the relationship we have with our brothers and sisters.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.491
There is power in the sibling bond.

00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:14.395
There is pageantry.

00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:15.914
There is petulance too.

00:02:15.914 --> 00:02:17.865
As when Neil Bush,

00:02:17.865 --> 00:02:21.969
sibling of both a president and a governor, famously griped

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.455
"I've lost patience for being compared

00:02:24.455 --> 00:02:27.263
to my older brothers."

00:02:27.263 --> 00:02:29.880
As if Jeb and George W. Bush were

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.933
somehow responsible for the savings and loan scandal

00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:37.153
and the messy divorce that marked Neil in the public eye.

00:02:37.922 --> 00:02:41.167
But more important than all of these things,

00:02:41.167 --> 00:02:44.411
the sibling bond can be a thing of abiding love.

00:02:44.411 --> 00:02:46.095
Our parents leave us too early,

00:02:46.095 --> 00:02:49.875
our spouse and our children come along too late.

00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:53.089
Our siblings are the only ones who are with us

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:55.304
for the entire ride.

00:02:55.304 --> 00:02:57.792
Over the arc of decades, there maybe nothing

00:02:57.792 --> 00:03:00.960
that defines us and informs us more powerfully

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.787
than our relationships with our sisters and brothers.

00:03:03.787 --> 00:03:06.044
It was true for me,

00:03:06.044 --> 00:03:08.703
it's true for your children

00:03:08.703 --> 00:03:12.227
and if you have siblings it's true for you, too.

00:03:12.227 --> 00:03:13.671
This picture was taken

00:03:13.671 --> 00:03:16.201
when Steve, on the left, was eight years old.

00:03:16.201 --> 00:03:18.976
I was six, our brother Gary was five

00:03:18.976 --> 00:03:21.294
and my brother Bruce was four.

00:03:21.294 --> 00:03:23.327
I will not say what year it was taken,

00:03:23.327 --> 00:03:25.305
it was not this year.

00:03:26.181 --> 00:03:29.090
I opened my new book, The Sibling Effect,

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.755
on a Saturday morning,

00:03:30.755 --> 00:03:32.705
not long before this picture was taken.

00:03:32.705 --> 00:03:34.412
When the three older brothers

00:03:34.412 --> 00:03:36.149
decided that it might be a very good idea

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:40.526
to lock the younger brother in a fuse cabinet in our playroom.

00:03:40.526 --> 00:03:41.334
(Laughter)

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:45.798
We were, believe it or not, trying to keep him safe.

00:03:45.798 --> 00:03:49.452
Our father was a hot-headed man,

00:03:49.452 --> 00:03:53.561
somebody who didn't take kindly to being disturbed on Saturday mornings,

00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:56.909
I don't know what he thought his life would be like on Saturday mornings

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:00.878
when he had four sons, ages four years older younger when the youngest one was born

00:04:00.878 --> 00:04:03.568
but they weren't quiet.

00:04:03.568 --> 00:04:05.353
He did not take to that well.

00:04:05.353 --> 00:04:08.659
And he would react to being disturbed on a Saturday morning

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:10.568
by stalking into the playroom

00:04:10.568 --> 00:04:14.728
and administer in a very freewheeling form of a corporal punishment,

00:04:14.728 --> 00:04:17.703
lashing out at whoever was within his arms' reach.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.126
We were by no means battered children but we did get hit

00:04:22.126 --> 00:04:24.497
and we found it terrifying.

00:04:24.974 --> 00:04:28.669
So we devised this sort of scattering high drill.

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.123
As soon as we saw or heard the footsteps coming

00:04:32.123 --> 00:04:35.216
Steve the oldest would wriggle under the couch,

00:04:35.216 --> 00:04:39.144
I would dive into the closet in the playroom,

00:04:39.144 --> 00:04:42.082
Gary would dive into a window seat toy chest,

00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:46.114
but not before we closed Bruce inside the fuse box.

00:04:46.114 --> 00:04:48.984
We told him it was Alan Shepard space capsule,

00:04:48.984 --> 00:04:50.346
and that somehow made it work better.

00:04:50.346 --> 00:04:51.999
(Laughter)

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:56.536
I dare say my father was never fooled by this rules.

00:04:56.536 --> 00:04:59.052
And it was only in later years that I began to think

00:04:59.052 --> 00:05:03.164
"Perhaps it wasn't a good idea to squeeze a for year old up against a panel of

00:05:03.164 --> 00:05:07.156
old style unscrewed high voltage fuses."

00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:08.618
(Laughter)

00:05:08.618 --> 00:05:12.882
But my brothers and I, even through those unhappy times

00:05:12.882 --> 00:05:14.952
came through them, with something

00:05:14.952 --> 00:05:18.851
that was clear and hard and fine.

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:22.099
A primal appreciation for the bond we shared.

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:26.032
We were a unit; a loud, messy

00:05:26.032 --> 00:05:29.145
brawling, loyal, loving,

00:05:29.145 --> 00:05:30.860
lasting unit.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.308
We felt much stronger that way

00:05:33.308 --> 00:05:35.035
than we ever could as individuals.

00:05:35.035 --> 00:05:38.177
And we knew that as our lives went on

00:05:38.177 --> 00:05:41.950
we could always be able to call on that strength.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.784
We're not alone.

00:05:43.784 --> 00:05:45.707
Until 15 years ago,

00:05:45.707 --> 00:05:48.677
scientists didn't really pay much attention to the sibling bond.

00:05:48.677 --> 00:05:50.041
And with good reason;

00:05:50.041 --> 00:05:53.190
you have just one mother, you have just one father

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.690
if you do marriage right, you have one spouse for life.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.517
Siblings can claim none of that uniqueness.

00:05:59.517 --> 00:06:03.531
They're interchangeable, fungible, a kind of household commodity.

00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:07.815
Parents set up shop and begin stocking their shelves with inventory.

00:06:07.815 --> 00:06:10.970
The only limitation would be in sperm, egg and economics.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.168
As long as you can keep breathing, you may as well keep stocking.

00:06:15.168 --> 00:06:19.161
Now, nature is perfectly happy with that arrangement

00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:21.612
because our primal directive here

00:06:21.612 --> 00:06:26.708
is to get as many as your genes as possible into the next generation.

00:06:26.708 --> 00:06:29.527
Animals wrestle with these same issues, too.

00:06:29.527 --> 00:06:32.426
But they have a more straight-forward way of dealing with things.

00:06:32.426 --> 00:06:35.289
A crested penguin that has laid two eggs

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:36.802
will take a good look at them

00:06:36.802 --> 00:06:39.025
and boot the smaller one out of the nest.

00:06:39.025 --> 00:06:45.064
The better to focus her attentions on a presumably hardier check in the bigger shell.

00:06:45.064 --> 00:06:48.557
A black eagle will allow all of her chicks to hatch

00:06:48.557 --> 00:06:49.862
and then stand back

00:06:49.862 --> 00:06:51.924
while the bigger ones fight it out with the little ones

00:06:51.924 --> 00:06:54.106
typically ripping them to ribbons

00:06:54.106 --> 00:06:57.627
and then settling back to grow up in peace.

00:06:57.627 --> 00:06:59.533
Piglets, cute as they are,

00:06:59.533 --> 00:07:03.614
are born with a strange little outward set of pointing teeth,

00:07:03.614 --> 00:07:05.757
that they use to jab at one another

00:07:05.757 --> 00:07:10.876
as they compete for the choices for the nursing spots.

00:07:10.876 --> 00:07:12.622
The problem for scientists

00:07:12.622 --> 00:07:18.034
was that this whole idea of siblings as second class citizens

00:07:18.034 --> 00:07:20.895
never really seemed to hold up.

00:07:20.895 --> 00:07:23.891
After the researchers had learned all they could

00:07:23.891 --> 00:07:30.749
from the relationships in the family, mothers and other relationships,

00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:33.550
they still came up with some temperamental dark matter.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.197
It was pulling at us.

00:07:35.197 --> 00:07:37.375
Exerting a gravity on its own.

00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:39.818
And that could only be our siblings.

00:07:39.818 --> 00:07:44.158
Humans are no different from animals.

00:07:44.178 --> 00:07:48.602
After we are born we do whatever we can

00:07:48.602 --> 00:07:51.190
to attract the attention of our parents

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.920
determining what our strongest selling points are

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.751
and marketing them ferociously.

00:07:56.751 --> 00:08:00.007
Someone's the funny one, someone's the pretty one,

00:08:00.007 --> 00:08:04.213
someone's the athlete, someone's the smart one.

00:08:04.213 --> 00:08:07.802
Scientists call this "De-identification".

00:08:07.802 --> 00:08:09.946
If my older brother is a high-school football player

00:08:09.946 --> 00:08:12.703
which if you saw my older brother you'd know he was not,

00:08:12.703 --> 00:08:15.810
I could become a high school football player, too

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:21.319
and get at most 50 percent of the applause in my family for doing that.

00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:24.859
Or, I could become student council president

00:08:24.859 --> 00:08:26.530
or specialize in the arts

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.997
and get a 100 percent of the attention in that area.

00:08:30.997 --> 00:08:34.541
Sometimes parents contaminate the De-identification process,

00:08:34.541 --> 00:08:37.211
communicating to their kids subtly or not,

00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:41.927
that only certain kinds of accomplishments would be applauded in the home.

00:08:41.927 --> 00:08:44.767
Joe Kennedy was famous for this

00:08:44.767 --> 00:08:47.146
making it clear to his nine children

00:08:47.146 --> 00:08:50.055
that they were expected to compete with one another in athletics

00:08:50.055 --> 00:08:52.492
and were expected to win,

00:08:52.492 --> 00:08:55.725
lest they'd be made to eat in the kitchen with the help

00:08:55.725 --> 00:08:59.394
rather than in the dining room with the family.

00:08:59.394 --> 00:09:01.415
It's no wonder

00:09:01.415 --> 00:09:03.426
that scrawny second born Jack Kennedy

00:09:03.426 --> 00:09:08.117
fought so hard to compete with his fitter first born brother Joe

00:09:08.117 --> 00:09:09.890
often at his peril.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.312
At one point engaging in a bicycle race around the house

00:09:13.312 --> 00:09:17.935
that resulted in a collision costing John 28 stitches.

00:09:17.935 --> 00:09:21.150
Joe walked away essentially unharmed.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.621
Parents exacerbate this problem further

00:09:23.621 --> 00:09:26.041
when they exhibit favoritism

00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:30.874
which they do overwhelmingly, no matter how much they admit it.

00:09:30.874 --> 00:09:35.260
A study I site in this Time Magazine, covering in the book The Sibling Effect,

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.440
found 70 percent of fathers and 65 percent of mothers

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.175
exhibit a preference for at least one child.

00:09:44.175 --> 00:09:45.696
And keep in mind here

00:09:45.696 --> 00:09:47.631
the keyword is exhibit.

00:09:47.631 --> 00:09:52.117
The remaining parents may simply be doing a better job of concealing things.

00:09:52.117 --> 00:09:54.165
(Laughter)

00:09:54.165 --> 00:09:59.728
I'd like to say that 95 percent of all parents have a favorite,

00:09:59.728 --> 00:10:02.270
five percent are lying about it.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:05.314
The exception is my wife and me, honestly

00:10:05.314 --> 00:10:07.859
we do not have a favorite.

00:10:07.859 --> 00:10:09.052
(Laughter)

00:10:09.052 --> 00:10:12.442
It's not parents' fault that they harbor feelings of favoritism.

00:10:12.442 --> 00:10:15.576
And here, too, our natural wiring is at work.

00:10:15.576 --> 00:10:20.523
Firstborns are the first products on the familial assembly line.

00:10:20.523 --> 00:10:25.941
Parents typically get two years of investing dollars, calories and

00:10:25.941 --> 00:10:27.809
so many other resources in them

00:10:27.809 --> 00:10:30.900
so that by the time the second born comes along

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.814
the first born is already, it's what corporations call, sunk costs,

00:10:35.814 --> 00:10:40.089
you don't wanna disinvest in this one, and launch the RND on the new product.

00:10:40.089 --> 00:10:41.225
(Laughter)

00:10:41.225 --> 00:10:43.194
So what we begin to do is say

00:10:43.194 --> 00:10:49.198
"I'm gonna lean to the Mac OS 10 and let the Mac OS 11, come out in a couple of years."

00:10:49.198 --> 00:10:51.622
So we tend to lean in that direction,

00:10:51.622 --> 00:10:54.030
but there are other forces at work, too.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:57.046
One of the same studies I looked at here,

00:10:57.046 --> 00:10:59.672
both here and in the book, found that

00:10:59.672 --> 00:11:06.514
improbably the most common favorite for a father is the last born daughter,

00:11:06.514 --> 00:11:10.056
the most common favorite for a mother is the first born son.

00:11:10.056 --> 00:11:12.342
Now this isn't Oedipal,

00:11:12.342 --> 00:11:15.259
never mind what the Freudians would have told us a hundred years ago,

00:11:15.259 --> 00:11:19.546
and it's not just that fathers are habitually wrapped around the fingers of their little girls,

00:11:19.546 --> 00:11:25.162
though I can tell you that, as the father of two girls that part definitely plays a role.

00:11:25.362 --> 00:11:29.230
Rather, there is a certain reproductive narcissism at work.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:34.626
Your opposite gender kids

00:11:34.626 --> 00:11:38.362
can never resemble you exactly.

00:11:38.362 --> 00:11:41.769
But if somehow they can resemble you temperamentally

00:11:41.769 --> 00:11:43.504
you love them all the more.

00:11:43.504 --> 00:11:47.038
As the result, the father who is a businessman

00:11:47.038 --> 00:11:54.101
will just melt at the idea of his MBA daughter with the toughest nails worldview.

00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:59.332
The mother who is a sensitive type will go gooey over her son the poet.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.824
Birth order, another topic I covered for Time

00:12:03.824 --> 00:12:07.164
and another topic I cover in the book

00:12:07.164 --> 00:12:09.294
plays out in other ways as well.

00:12:09.294 --> 00:12:12.315
Long before scientists began looking at this

00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:16.347
parents noticed that there's certain temperamental templates

00:12:16.347 --> 00:12:20.985
associated with all birth rankings. The serious, striving first born,

00:12:20.985 --> 00:12:23.365
the caught-in-a-thicket middle born,

00:12:23.365 --> 00:12:26.283
the wild child of a last born.

00:12:26.283 --> 00:12:28.927
And once again when scientists did crack this field

00:12:28.927 --> 00:12:31.574
they found out mom and dad are right.

00:12:31.574 --> 00:12:36.984
First borns across history have tended to be bigger and healthier than later borns,

00:12:36.984 --> 00:12:41.962
in part because of the head start they got on food in an area which it could be scarce.

00:12:41.962 --> 00:12:44.916
First born are also vaccinated more reliably

00:12:44.916 --> 00:12:48.922
and tend to have more follow up visits to doctors

00:12:48.922 --> 00:12:50.550
when they get sick.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.444
And this pattern continues today.

00:12:52.444 --> 00:12:58.295
This IQ question is, sadly -- I can say this as a second born -- a very real thing,

00:12:58.295 --> 00:13:01.823
first borns have a three point IQ advantage over second borns

00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:05.490
and second borns have a 1.5 IQ advantage over later borns,

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.442
partly because of the exclusive attention first borns get

00:13:09.442 --> 00:13:10.595
from mom and dad,

00:13:10.595 --> 00:13:12.866
and partly because they get a chance

00:13:12.866 --> 00:13:15.416
to mentor their younger kids.

00:13:15.416 --> 00:13:16.887
All of this explains why

00:13:16.887 --> 00:13:18.528
first borns are likelier to be CEOs,

00:13:18.528 --> 00:13:20.490
they are likelier to be senators,

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.181
they are likelier to be astronauts

00:13:22.181 --> 00:13:26.595
and they are likelier to be earn more than other kids are.

00:13:26.595 --> 00:13:29.513
Last borns come into the world

00:13:29.513 --> 00:13:31.408
with a whole different set of challenges.

00:13:31.408 --> 00:13:34.006
The smallest and weakest cubs in the den,

00:13:34.006 --> 00:13:37.223
they're at the greatest risk of getting eaten alive,

00:13:37.223 --> 00:13:40.755
so they have to develop what are called low power skills.

00:13:40.755 --> 00:13:42.461
The ability to charm and disarm

00:13:42.461 --> 00:13:45.653
to intuit what's going on in someone else's head,

00:13:45.653 --> 00:13:48.207
the better to duck the punch before it lands.

00:13:48.207 --> 00:13:50.156
(Laughter)

00:13:50.156 --> 00:13:51.825
They are also flat out funnier

00:13:51.825 --> 00:13:54.926
which is another thing that comes in handy

00:13:54.926 --> 00:13:58.877
because a person who's making you laugh is a very hard person to slug.

00:13:58.877 --> 00:14:00.154
(Laughter)

00:14:00.154 --> 00:14:03.785
It's perhaps no coincidence that over the course of history

00:14:03.785 --> 00:14:05.849
some of our greatest satirists:

00:14:05.849 --> 00:14:07.391
Swift,

00:14:07.391 --> 00:14:09.063
Twain,

00:14:09.063 --> 00:14:11.275
Voltaire,

00:14:11.275 --> 00:14:12.867
Colbert

00:14:12.867 --> 00:14:14.914
(Laughter)

00:14:14.914 --> 00:14:18.403
are either the last borns or among the last

00:14:18.403 --> 00:14:20.703
in very large families.

00:14:20.703 --> 00:14:23.360
Most middle borns don't get quite a sweet a deal.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:25.601
I think of us as the flyover states.

00:14:25.601 --> 00:14:27.462
We are --

00:14:27.462 --> 00:14:30.265
(Laughter)

00:14:30.265 --> 00:14:34.258
-- we're the ones who fight harder for recognition in the home.

00:14:34.258 --> 00:14:36.879
We're the ones who are always raising our hands

00:14:36.879 --> 00:14:40.080
while someone else at the table is getting called on.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.595
We're the ones who tend to take a little longer

00:14:42.595 --> 00:14:44.816
to find their direction in life.

00:14:44.816 --> 00:14:48.557
And there can be self-esteem issues associated with that.

00:14:48.557 --> 00:14:50.619
Now, withstanding the fact that I've been asked to do TED

00:14:50.619 --> 00:14:52.659
so I feel much better about these things right now.

00:14:52.659 --> 00:14:54.022
(Laughter)

00:14:54.022 --> 00:14:58.420
But the upside for middle borns is that they also

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:02.811
tend to develop denser and richer relationships outside the home

00:15:02.811 --> 00:15:06.075
but that advantage comes also from something a bit disadvantaged

00:15:06.075 --> 00:15:09.491
simply because their needs weren't met as well in the home.

00:15:09.491 --> 00:15:13.564
The feuds in the playroom that play out over

00:15:13.564 --> 00:15:15.921
favoritism, birth order and so many other issues

00:15:15.921 --> 00:15:19.543
are as unrelenting as they seem.

00:15:19.543 --> 00:15:21.473
In one study i cite in the book,

00:15:21.473 --> 00:15:23.944
children in the two to four age group

00:15:23.944 --> 00:15:29.543
engage in one fight every 6.3 minutes

00:15:29.543 --> 00:15:32.786
or 9.5 fights an hour.

00:15:32.786 --> 00:15:36.492
That's not fighting, that's performance art.

00:15:36.492 --> 00:15:39.175
That's extraordinary.

00:15:40.113 --> 00:15:42.053
One reason for this is that

00:15:42.053 --> 00:15:44.889
there are a lot more people in your home than you think there are

00:15:44.889 --> 00:15:47.689
or at least a lot more relationships.

00:15:47.689 --> 00:15:52.152
Every person in your house has a discreet one-on-one relationship

00:15:52.152 --> 00:15:53.390
with every other person

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:57.487
and those pairings or dyads add up fast.

00:15:57.487 --> 00:16:00.453
In a family with two parents and two kids

00:16:00.453 --> 00:16:02.402
there are six dyads.

00:16:02.402 --> 00:16:04.755
Mum has a relationship with child A and B,

00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:07.210
dad has a relationship with child A and B.

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:09.552
There's the marital relationship

00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:12.923
and there is the relationship between the kids themselves.

00:16:12.923 --> 00:16:16.417
The formula for this looks very chilly but it's real.

00:16:16.417 --> 00:16:21.056
K equals the number of people in your household

00:16:21.056 --> 00:16:25.369
and X equals the number of dyads.

00:16:25.369 --> 00:16:28.968
In a five-person-family there are ten discreet dyads.

00:16:28.968 --> 00:16:32.870
The eight-person Brady Bunch, never mind the sweetness here,

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:36.168
there were 28 dyads in that family.

00:16:36.168 --> 00:16:41.556
The original Kennedy family with nine kids had 55 different relationships.

00:16:41.556 --> 00:16:45.785
And Bobby Kennedy who grew up to have 11 children of his own

00:16:45.785 --> 00:16:50.340
had a household with a whopping 91 dyads.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:54.017
This overpopulation of relationships

00:16:54.017 --> 00:16:57.403
makes fights unavoidable.

00:16:57.403 --> 00:17:02.371
And far and away the biggest trigger for all sibling fights is property.

00:17:02.371 --> 00:17:06.165
Studies have found that over 95 percent of the fights

00:17:06.165 --> 00:17:10.260
among small children concern somebody touching, playing with,

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:14.071
looking at the other person's stuff.

00:17:14.071 --> 00:17:19.204
This in its own way is healthy if it's very noisy,

00:17:19.204 --> 00:17:22.230
and the reason is that small children

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:25.317
come into the world with absolutely no control.

00:17:25.317 --> 00:17:27.026
They are utterly helpless.

00:17:27.026 --> 00:17:31.527
The only way they have of projecting their very limited power

00:17:31.527 --> 00:17:34.158
is through the objects they can call their own.

00:17:34.158 --> 00:17:37.508
When somebody crosses that very erasable line

00:17:37.508 --> 00:17:41.508
they're gonna go nuts, and that's what happens.

00:17:41.508 --> 00:17:45.938
Another very common casus belli among children

00:17:45.938 --> 00:17:47.582
is the idea of fairness.

00:17:47.582 --> 00:17:50.176
As any parent who hears 14 times a day:

00:17:50.176 --> 00:17:53.428
"But that's unfair", can tell you.

00:17:53.428 --> 00:17:55.889
In a way this is good too though.

00:17:55.889 --> 00:17:58.523
Kids are born with a very innate sense

00:17:58.523 --> 00:18:01.529
of right and wrong, of a fair deal versus

00:18:01.529 --> 00:18:04.726
an unfair one and this teaches them powerful lessons.

00:18:04.726 --> 00:18:09.546
You wanna know how powerfully encoded fairness is in the human genome?

00:18:09.546 --> 00:18:12.436
We process that phenomenon

00:18:12.436 --> 00:18:14.902
and through the same lobe in our brain

00:18:14.902 --> 00:18:18.275
that processes disgust, meaning we react

00:18:18.275 --> 00:18:21.448
to the idea of somebody being cheated

00:18:21.448 --> 00:18:24.914
the same way we react to putrefied meat.

00:18:24.914 --> 00:18:26.103
(Laughter)

00:18:26.103 --> 00:18:31.516
Any wonder that this fellow Bernie Madoff is unpopular.

00:18:32.793 --> 00:18:36.402
All of this dramas played out day to day,

00:18:36.402 --> 00:18:37.834
moment to moment

00:18:37.834 --> 00:18:42.728
serve as a real time, total immersion exercise for life.

00:18:42.728 --> 00:18:45.731
Siblings teach each other conflict avoidance

00:18:45.731 --> 00:18:50.190
and conflict resolution, when to stand up for themselves,

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:53.268
when to stand down, they learn love,

00:18:53.268 --> 00:18:59.013
loyalty, honesty, sharing, caring, compromise,

00:18:59.013 --> 00:19:02.552
the disclosure of secrets and much more important,

00:19:02.552 --> 00:19:05.994
the keeping of confidences.

00:19:06.656 --> 00:19:09.582
I listen to my young daughters -- rren't they adorable? --

00:19:09.582 --> 00:19:14.098
I listen to my young daughters talking late into the night.

00:19:14.098 --> 00:19:17.749
The same way my parents no doubt listened to my brothers and me talking,

00:19:17.749 --> 00:19:20.951
and sometimes I intervene, but usually I don't.

00:19:20.951 --> 00:19:24.702
They're part of a conversation I am not part of,

00:19:24.702 --> 00:19:27.579
nobody else in the world is part of,

00:19:27.579 --> 00:19:32.568
and it's a conversation that can and should go on for the rest of their lives.

00:19:32.568 --> 00:19:35.290
From this will come a sense of constancy

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:38.328
a sense of having a permanent traveling companion,

00:19:38.328 --> 00:19:41.152
somebody with whom they road tested life

00:19:41.152 --> 00:19:45.534
before they ever had to get out and travel it on their own.

00:19:45.534 --> 00:19:49.717
Brothers and sisters aren't the sine qua non of a happy life;

00:19:49.717 --> 00:19:52.601
plenty of adult sibling relationships are fatally broken

00:19:52.601 --> 00:19:56.519
and need to be abandoned for the sanity of everybody involved.

00:19:56.519 --> 00:20:00.886
And only children throughout history have shown themselves

00:20:00.886 --> 00:20:03.677
to be creatively, brilliantly capable of

00:20:03.677 --> 00:20:06.577
getting their socialization and comradeship skills

00:20:06.577 --> 00:20:10.701
through friends, through cousins, through classmates.

00:20:10.701 --> 00:20:14.777
But having siblings and not making the most of those bonds

00:20:14.777 --> 00:20:18.548
is I believe fally of the first order.

00:20:18.548 --> 00:20:23.153
If relationships are broken and are fixable, fix them.

00:20:23.153 --> 00:20:25.872
If they work make them even better.

00:20:25.872 --> 00:20:28.737
Failing to do so, is a little like having

00:20:28.737 --> 00:20:32.588
a thousand acres of fertile farmland and never planting it.

00:20:32.588 --> 00:20:36.604
Yes, you can always get your food at the supermarket

00:20:36.604 --> 00:20:40.098
but think what you're allowing to lie fallow.

00:20:40.098 --> 00:20:45.487
Life is short, it's finite, and it plays for keeps.

00:20:45.487 --> 00:20:50.644
Siblings maybe among the richest harvests of the time we have here.

00:20:50.644 --> 00:20:51.820
Thank you.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:57.271
(Applause)
