00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.176
I'm going to talk about
how AI and mankind can coexist,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.016
but first, we have to rethink
about our human values.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.360
So let me first make a confession
about my errors in my values.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.176
It was 11 o'clock, December 16, 1991.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.880
I was about to become a father
for the first time.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.336
My wife, Shen-Ling,
lay in the hospital bed

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.440
going through a very difficult
12-hour labor.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.576
I sat by her bedside

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.976
but looked anxiously at my watch,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.800
and I knew something that she didn't.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.240
I knew that if in one hour,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.296
our child didn't come,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.256
I was going to leave her there

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.936
and go back to work

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.536
and make a presentation about AI

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.760
to my boss, Apple's CEO.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.056
Fortunately, my daughter
was born at 11:30 --

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.016
(Laughter)

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.976
(Applause)

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.336
sparing me from doing the unthinkable,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.856
and to this day, I am so sorry

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.536
for letting my work ethic
take precedence over love for my family.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.296
(Applause)

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.936
My AI talk, however, went off brilliantly.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.696
(Laughter)

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.856
Apple loved my work
and decided to announce it

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.576
at TED1992,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.616
26 years ago on this very stage.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.696
I thought I had made one of the biggest,
most important discoveries in AI,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.640
and so did the "Wall Street Journal"
on the following day.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.976
But as far as discoveries went,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.336
it turned out,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.136
I didn't discover India, or America.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.240
Perhaps I discovered
a little island off of Portugal.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.976
But the AI era of discovery continued,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.216
and more scientists
poured their souls into it.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.856
About 10 years ago, the grand AI discovery

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.056
was made by three
North American scientists,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.680
and it's known as deep learning.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.096
Deep learning is a technology
that can take a huge amount of data

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.856
within one single domain

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.816
and learn to predict or decide
at superhuman accuracy.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.616
For example, if we show
the deep learning network

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.456
a massive number of food photos,

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.056
it can recognize food

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.376
such as hot dog or no hot dog.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.536
(Applause)

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.576
Or if we show it many pictures
and videos and sensor data

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.136
from driving on the highway,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.440
it can actually drive a car
as well as a human being

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.016
on the highway.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.856
And what if we showed
this deep learning network

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.280
all the speeches made by President Trump?

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.680
Then this artificially
intelligent President Trump,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.816
actually the network --

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.496
(Laughter)

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.736
can --

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.816
(Applause)

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.176
You like double oxymorons, huh?

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.056
(Laughter)

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.176
(Applause)

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.456
So this network, if given the request
to make a speech about AI,

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.120
he, or it, might say --

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.376
(Recording) Donald Trump:
It's a great thing

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.336
to build a better world
with artificial intelligence.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.376
Kai-Fu Lee: And maybe in another language?

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.216
DT: (Speaking Chinese)

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.736
(Laughter)

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.920
KFL: You didn't know
he knew Chinese, did you?

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.136
So deep learning has become the core
in the era of AI discovery,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.976
and that's led by the US.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.256
But we're now in the era
of implementation,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.816
where what really matters is execution,
product quality, speed and data.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.936
And that's where China comes in.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.536
Chinese entrepreneurs,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.456
who I fund as a venture capitalist,

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.216
are incredible workers,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.176
amazing work ethic.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.496
My example in the delivery room is nothing
compared to how hard people work in China.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.216
As an example, one startup
tried to claim work-life balance:

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.936
"Come work for us because we are 996."

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.216
And what does that mean?

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.640
It means the work hours
of 9am to 9pm, six days a week.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.240
That's contrasted
with other startups that do 997.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.416
And the Chinese product quality
has consistently gone up

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.136
in the past decade,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.280
and that's because of
a fiercely competitive environment.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.656
In Silicon Valley, entrepreneurs
compete in a very gentlemanly fashion,

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.576
sort of like in old wars
in which each side took turns

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.856
to fire at each other.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.936
(Laughter)

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.976
But in the Chinese environment,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.880
it's truly a gladiatorial
fight to the death.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:13.016
In such a brutal environment,
entrepreneurs learn to grow very rapidly,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.976
they learn to make their products
better at lightning speed,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.336
and they learn
to hone their business models

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.760
until they're impregnable.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.256
As a result, great Chinese products
like WeChat and Weibo

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.696
are arguably better

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.200
than the equivalent American products
from Facebook and Twitter.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.016
And the Chinese market
embraces this change

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.056
and accelerated change
and paradigm shifts.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.176
As an example, if any of you go to China,

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.216
you will see it's almost cashless
and credit card-less,

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.976
because that thing that we all
talk about, mobile payment,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.416
has become the reality in China.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.736
In the last year,

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.696
18.8 trillion US dollars
were transacted on mobile internet,

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.656
and that's because
of very robust technologies

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.936
built behind it.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.400
It's even bigger than the China GDP.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.736
And this technology, you can say,
how can it be bigger than the GDP?

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.736
Because it includes all transactions:

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.536
wholesale, channels,
retail, online, offline,

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.616
going into a shopping mall
or going into a farmers market like this.

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.016
The technology is used
by 700 million people

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.096
to pay each other, not just merchants,

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.536
so it's peer to peer,

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.240
and it's almost transaction-fee-free.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.096
And it's instantaneous,

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.560
and it's used everywhere.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.696
And finally, the China market is enormous.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.696
This market is large,

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.216
which helps give entrepreneurs
more users, more revenue,

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.576
more investment, but most importantly,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.136
it gives the entrepreneurs a chance
to collect a huge amount of data

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.120
which becomes rocket fuel
for the AI engine.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.896
So as a result, the Chinese AI companies

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.656
have leaped ahead

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.776
so that today, the most valuable companies

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.416
in computer vision, speech recognition,

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.856
speech synthesis,
machine translation and drones

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.800
are all Chinese companies.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.616
So with the US leading
the era of discovery

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.776
and China leading
the era of implementation,

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.056
we are now in an amazing age

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.336
where the dual engine
of the two superpowers

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.040
are working together

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.616
to drive the fastest
revolution in technology

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.000
that we have ever seen as humans.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.136
And this will bring tremendous wealth,

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.936
unprecedented wealth:

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.856
16 trillion dollars, according to PwC,

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.256
in terms of added GDP
to the worldwide GDP by 2030.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.896
It will also bring immense challenges

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.496
in terms of potential job replacements.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.680
Whereas in the Industrial Age

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.416
it created more jobs

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:03.216
because craftsman jobs were being
decomposed into jobs in the assembly line,

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.216
so more jobs were created.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.176
But AI completely replaces
the individual jobs

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.456
in the assembly line with robots.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.416
And it's not just in factories,

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.496
but truckers, drivers

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.616
and even jobs like telesales,
customer service

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.616
and hematologists as well as radiologists

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.736
over the next 15 years

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.296
are going to be gradually replaced

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.760
by artificial intelligence.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.416
And only the creative jobs --

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.416
(Laughter)

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.640
I have to make myself safe, right?

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.936
Really, the creative jobs
are the ones that are protected,

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.000
because AI can optimize but not create.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.535
But what's more serious
than the loss of jobs

00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:51.336
is the loss of meaning,

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.496
because the work ethic
in the Industrial Age

00:08:54.520 --> 00:09:00.136
has brainwashed us into thinking
that work is the reason we exist,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.096
that work defined
the meaning of our lives.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:09.416
And I was a prime and willing victim
to that type of workaholic thinking.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.056
I worked incredibly hard.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.656
That's why I almost left
my wife in the delivery room,

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.856
that's why I worked 996
alongside my entrepreneurs.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:23.296
And that obsession that I had with work

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.376
ended abruptly a few years ago

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.320
when I was diagnosed
with fourth stage lymphoma.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.616
The PET scan here shows
over 20 malignant tumors

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.816
jumping out like fireballs,

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.416
melting away my ambition.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.896
But more importantly,

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.656
it helped me reexamine my life.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.776
Knowing that I may only have
a few months to live

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.736
caused me to see how foolish it was

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.336
for me to base my entire self-worth

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.400
on how hard I worked
and the accomplishments from hard work.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.296
My priorities were
completely out of order.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.920
I neglected my family.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.416
My father had passed away,

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.240
and I never had a chance
to tell him I loved him.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.856
My mother had dementia
and no longer recognized me,

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.800
and my children had grown up.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.056
During my chemotherapy,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.536
I read a book by Bronnie Ware

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:26.056
who talked about dying wishes and regrets
of the people in the deathbed.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.336
She found that facing death,

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.960
nobody regretted that they didn't
work hard enough in this life.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:38.056
They only regretted that they didn't
spend enough time with their loved ones

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.840
and that they didn't spread their love.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.936
So I am fortunately today in remission.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:53.816
(Applause)

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.816
So I can be back at TED again

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.216
to share with you
that I have changed my ways.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.000
I now only work 965 --

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.176
occasionally 996, but usually 965.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.096
I moved closer to my mother,

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.576
my wife usually travels with me,

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.416
and when my kids have vacation,
if they don't come home, I go to them.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.896
So it's a new form of life

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.736
that helped me recognize

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.936
how important it is that love is for me,

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.376
and facing death
helped me change my life,

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.856
but it also helped me see a new way

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.656
of how AI should impact mankind

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.160
and work and coexist with mankind,

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:41.176
that really, AI is taking away
a lot of routine jobs,

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.856
but routine jobs are not what we're about.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.136
Why we exist is love.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.256
When we hold our newborn baby,

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.776
love at first sight,

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.576
or when we help someone in need,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.856
humans are uniquely able
to give and receive love,

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.680
and that's what differentiates us from AI.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.496
Despite what science fiction may portray,

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.256
I can responsibly tell you
that AI has no love.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.816
When AlphaGo defeated
the world champion Ke Jie,

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.936
while Ke Jie was crying
and loving the game of go,

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.136
AlphaGo felt no happiness from winning

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.640
and certainly no desire
to hug a loved one.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.256
So how do we differentiate ourselves

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.816
as humans in the age of AI?

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.936
We talked about the axis of creativity,

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.816
and certainly that is one possibility,

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.136
and now we introduce a new axis

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.776
that we can call compassion,
love, or empathy.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.376
Those are things that AI cannot do.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.216
So as AI takes away the routine jobs,

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.200
I like to think we can, we should
and we must create jobs of compassion.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.136
You might ask how many of those there are,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.776
but I would ask you:

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.616
Do you not think that we are going
to need a lot of social workers

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.240
to help us make this transition?

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.216
Do you not think we need
a lot of compassionate caregivers

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.936
to give more medical care to more people?

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.216
Do you not think we're going to need
10 times more teachers

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.016
to help our children find their way

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.296
to survive and thrive
in this brave new world?

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.760
And with all the newfound wealth,

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.336
should we not also make
labors of love into careers

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.056
and let elderly accompaniment

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.576
or homeschooling become careers also?

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.880
(Applause)

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.056
This graph is surely not perfect,

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.616
but it points at four ways
that we can work with AI.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.216
AI will come and take away
the routine jobs

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.280
and in due time, we will be thankful.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.096
AI will become great tools
for the creatives

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.776
so that scientists, artists,
musicians and writers

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.400
can be even more creative.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:03.496
AI will work with humans
as analytical tools

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.216
that humans can wrap their warmth around

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.136
for the high-compassion jobs.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.816
And we can always differentiate ourselves

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.656
with the uniquely capable jobs

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.296
that are both compassionate and creative,

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:21.496
using and leveraging
our irreplaceable brains and hearts.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.816
So there you have it:

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.480
a blueprint of coexistence
for humans and AI.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.216
AI is serendipity.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.216
It is here to liberate us
from routine jobs,

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.920
and it is here to remind us
what it is that makes us human.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.416
So let us choose to embrace AI
and to love one another.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.656
Thank you.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:47.840
(Applause)
