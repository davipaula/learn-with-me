00:00:06.365 --> 00:00:08.569
Over the course of our lifetimes,

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:12.449
our bodies undergo a series 
of extraordinary metamorphoses:

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:13.393
we grow,

00:00:13.393 --> 00:00:14.661
experience puberty,

00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:16.485
and many of us reproduce.

00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:17.778
Behind the scenes,

00:00:17.778 --> 00:00:22.231
the endocrine system works 
constantly to orchestrate these changes.

00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:24.853
Alongside growth and sexual maturity,

00:00:24.853 --> 00:00:27.838
this system regulates everything 
from your sleep

00:00:27.838 --> 00:00:30.220
to the rhythm of your beating heart,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.884
exerting its influence over each 
and every one of your cells.

00:00:34.884 --> 00:00:37.143
The endocrine system relies 
on interactions

00:00:37.143 --> 00:00:39.692
between three features to do its job:

00:00:39.692 --> 00:00:40.615
glands,

00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:41.520
hormones,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.294
and trillions of cell receptors.

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:47.444
Firstly, there are several
hormone-producing glands:

00:00:47.444 --> 00:00:48.815
three in your brain,

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:51.161
and seven in the rest of your body.

00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:54.033
Each is surrounded by 
a network of blood vessels,

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:58.452
from which they extract ingredients 
to manufacture dozens of hormones.

00:00:58.452 --> 00:01:01.736
Those hormones are then
pumped out in tiny amounts,

00:01:01.736 --> 00:01:04.031
usually into the bloodstream.

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:08.151
From there, each hormone needs 
to locate a set of target cells

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:10.889
in order to bring about a specific change.

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:14.681
To find its targets, 
it’s helped along by receptors,

00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:18.934
which are special proteins inside 
or on the cell’s surface.

00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:22.948
Those receptors recognise
specific hormones as they waft by,

00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:24.697
and bind to them.

00:01:24.697 --> 00:01:25.807
When this happens,

00:01:25.807 --> 00:01:29.681
that hormone-receptor combination 
triggers a range of effects

00:01:29.681 --> 00:01:34.222
that either increase or decrease 
specific processes inside the cell

00:01:34.222 --> 00:01:36.840
to change the way that cell behaves.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.739
By exposing millions of cells at a time

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:42.462
to hormones
in carefully-regulated quantities,

00:01:42.462 --> 00:01:47.022
the endocrine system drives 
large-scale changes across the body.

00:01:47.022 --> 00:01:51.434
Take, for instance, the thyroid 
and the two hormones it produces,

00:01:51.434 --> 00:01:54.807
triiodothyronine and thyroxine.

00:01:54.807 --> 00:01:57.805
These hormones travel to most 
of the body’s cells,

00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:01.179
where they influence how quickly 
those cells use energy

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.195
and how rapidly they work.

00:02:03.195 --> 00:02:06.166
In turn, that regulates everything 
from breathing rate

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:07.271
to heartbeat,

00:02:07.271 --> 00:02:08.389
body temperature,

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:09.992
and digestion.

00:02:09.992 --> 00:02:14.387
Hormones also have some of their most
visible—and familiar—effects

00:02:14.387 --> 00:02:16.070
during puberty.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.443
In men, puberty begins when 
the testes start secreting testosterone.

00:02:20.443 --> 00:02:23.602
That triggers the gradual development 
of the sexual organs,

00:02:23.602 --> 00:02:25.241
makes facial hair sprout,

00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:27.693
and causes the voice to deepen

00:02:27.693 --> 00:02:29.910
and height to increase.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.643
In women, estrogen secreted from the
ovaries signals the start of adulthood.

00:02:34.643 --> 00:02:36.051
It helps the body develop,

00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:37.318
makes the hips widen,

00:02:37.318 --> 00:02:39.706
and thickens the womb’s lining,

00:02:39.706 --> 00:02:43.267
preparing the body 
for menstruation or pregnancy.

00:02:43.267 --> 00:02:46.199
An enduring misconception around 
the endocrine system

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:50.232
is that there are exclusively male 
and female hormones.

00:02:50.232 --> 00:02:54.187
In fact, men and women 
have estrogen and testosterone,

00:02:54.187 --> 00:02:56.215
just in different amounts.

00:02:56.215 --> 00:02:59.464
Both hormones play a role 
in pregnancy, as well,

00:02:59.464 --> 00:03:03.511
alongside more than 10 other hormones
that ensure the growth of the fetus,

00:03:03.511 --> 00:03:04.538
enable birth,

00:03:04.538 --> 00:03:07.530
and help the mother feed her child.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.767
Such periods of hormonal change are also
associated with fluctuations in mood.

00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:14.886
That’s because hormones can influence

00:03:14.886 --> 00:03:19.238
the production of certain chemicals 
in the brain, like serotonin.

00:03:19.238 --> 00:03:23.698
When chemical levels shift,
they may cause changes in mood, as well.

00:03:23.698 --> 00:03:27.972
But that’s not to say that hormones 
have unlimited power over us.

00:03:27.972 --> 00:03:31.294
They’re frequently viewed as the main 
drivers of our behavior,

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:35.321
making us slaves to their effects,
especially during puberty.

00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:38.858
But research shows that our behavior 
is collectively shaped

00:03:38.858 --> 00:03:40.947
by a variety of influences,

00:03:40.947 --> 00:03:43.218
including the brain 
and its neurotransmitters,

00:03:43.218 --> 00:03:44.261
our hormones,

00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:46.625
and various social factors.

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:48.931
The primary function 
of the endocrine system

00:03:48.931 --> 00:03:53.252
is to regulate our bodily processes, 
not control us.

00:03:53.252 --> 00:03:54.443
Sometimes disease,

00:03:54.443 --> 00:03:55.184
stress,

00:03:55.184 --> 00:03:58.955
and even diet can disrupt 
that regulatory function, however,

00:03:58.955 --> 00:04:01.766
altering the quantity of hormones 
that glands secrete

00:04:01.766 --> 00:04:04.403
or changing the way that cells respond.

00:04:04.403 --> 00:04:07.545
Diabetes is one of the most 
common hormonal disorders,

00:04:07.545 --> 00:04:11.161
occurring when the pancreas 
secretes too little insulin,

00:04:11.161 --> 00:04:13.875
a hormone that manages blood sugar levels.

00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:16.411
And hypo- and hyperthyroidism

00:04:16.411 --> 00:04:21.538
occur when the thyroid gland makes
too little or too much thyroid hormone.

00:04:21.538 --> 00:04:25.790
When there’s too little thyroid hormone,
that results in a slowed heart rate,

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:26.619
fatigue,

00:04:26.619 --> 00:04:27.788
and depression,

00:04:27.788 --> 00:04:29.822
and when there’s too much 
thyroid hormone,

00:04:29.822 --> 00:04:30.677
weight loss,

00:04:30.677 --> 00:04:31.737
sleeplessness,

00:04:31.737 --> 00:04:33.515
and irritability.

00:04:33.515 --> 00:04:34.793
But most of the time,

00:04:34.793 --> 00:04:38.603
the endocrine system manages to keep 
our bodies in a state of balance.

00:04:38.603 --> 00:04:40.867
And through its constant regulation,

00:04:40.867 --> 00:04:45.189
it drives the changes that ultimately
help us become who we are.
