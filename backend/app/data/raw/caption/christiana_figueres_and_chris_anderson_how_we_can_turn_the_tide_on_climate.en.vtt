00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:02.011
[Citizens of the world]

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:05.146
[We face a global crisis
of unprecedented scale]

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.529
[Please stand by for a message from ... ]

00:00:07.553 --> 00:00:10.746
[the Secretary-General of 
the United Nations António Guterres]

00:00:10.746 --> 00:00:14.889
The climate emergency
is the defining crisis of our time.

00:00:14.913 --> 00:00:17.970
We are in a race against time,
and we are losing.

00:00:18.294 --> 00:00:22.009
There is a growing tide of impatience,
especially among young people,

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:23.761
with global inaction.

00:00:23.785 --> 00:00:25.697
We need more ambition from all:

00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:29.850
governments, cities, businesses,
investors and people everywhere.

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.636
So I'm pleased you are
launching TED Countdown.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.708
Your influence and ideas
can help accelerate momentum

00:00:36.732 --> 00:00:39.387
for a carbon-neutral world by 2050.

00:00:39.836 --> 00:00:43.656
That is the only way to avert
the worst impacts of global heating.

00:00:44.074 --> 00:00:47.089
We have the tools, the science
and the resources.

00:00:47.526 --> 00:00:51.486
Let us now get into this race
with political will and energy.

00:00:51.963 --> 00:00:55.796
To do anything less will be a betrayal
of our entire human family

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.669
and generations to come.

00:00:57.693 --> 00:00:58.843
Thank you.

00:00:59.487 --> 00:01:01.183
Announcer: And now, please welcome

00:01:01.207 --> 00:01:03.666
one of the architects
of the Paris Climate Agreement

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.849
Christiana Figueres

00:01:04.873 --> 00:01:06.898
and the head of TED, Chris Anderson.

00:01:06.922 --> 00:01:13.922
(Applause)

00:01:14.982 --> 00:01:16.776
Chris Anderson: Welcome, welcome.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.938
Something remarkable
is going to happen in the next hour.

00:01:21.851 --> 00:01:24.486
The world's single
most alarming challenge,

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.204
which looks something like this ...

00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:30.817
is about to go head-to-head

00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:33.522
with some of the world's
most amazing minds

00:01:33.546 --> 00:01:35.395
and courageous hearts,

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:37.734
which look something like you.

00:01:38.434 --> 00:01:41.950
The extraordinary audience we have
here in New York and around the world.

00:01:41.974 --> 00:01:45.307
Christiana, it's quite the crowd
we get to hang out with this morning.

00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:47.387
Christiana Figueres:
It sure is, no kidding.

00:01:47.411 --> 00:01:49.736
It's a good thing
that everyone is here together,

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.475
because actually, this initiative
that we're just about to launch

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:55.752
needs everyone to participate.

00:01:56.173 --> 00:01:58.240
And here it is.

00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:00.031
Countdown.

00:02:00.358 --> 00:02:04.191
CA: Countdown is a global initiative
to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

00:02:04.215 --> 00:02:07.334
It's seeking bold solutions
in five big areas,

00:02:07.358 --> 00:02:08.984
imagining what could be achieved

00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:13.656
if different groups broke out
of their silos and acted together.

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:18.044
Starting today, you can go to
countdown.ted.com

00:02:18.068 --> 00:02:20.335
and sign up to join the Countdown.

00:02:21.163 --> 00:02:22.893
Early in 2020,

00:02:22.917 --> 00:02:25.028
we'll be sharing plans
on how you can connect

00:02:25.052 --> 00:02:27.594
with others in your company,
your city or your school

00:02:27.618 --> 00:02:29.256
to engage in this issue.

00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:32.347
It's all leading up to global gatherings

00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:35.156
on 10.10.2020.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.220
Everyone in the world
is invited to participate.

00:02:38.244 --> 00:02:39.418
CF: And so that's why,

00:02:39.442 --> 00:02:42.951
although I've been part
of many initiatives along the years,

00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:44.903
I'm really excited about this one.

00:02:44.927 --> 00:02:49.401
Because Countdown
is an invitation to everyone, everyone,

00:02:49.425 --> 00:02:51.828
to play their part in saving our planet

00:02:51.852 --> 00:02:55.447
and creating an exciting future.

00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:57.526
Politicians and citizens,

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.149
CEOs and their customers,

00:03:00.173 --> 00:03:03.069
their employees, their investors,

00:03:03.093 --> 00:03:05.244
old and young,

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:06.593
north and south.

00:03:06.617 --> 00:03:08.926
CA: (Laughs) I see what you did there.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.586
(Laughter)

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:13.782
But look, our goal is not to plunge in

00:03:13.806 --> 00:03:15.671
with something new that is competitive

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:18.703
with the amazing initiatives
already out there.

00:03:18.727 --> 00:03:19.877
No.

00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:24.696
It's to identify the best solutions
that have already been worked on,

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.101
to cross-fertilize them, to amplify them

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:29.942
and then activate them

00:03:29.966 --> 00:03:32.886
by bringing together
these different groups.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.697
CF: And if that happens,

00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:38.355
we believe there is a way out
of the climate crisis.

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:40.006
That's what we want to facilitate.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.790
But now, Chris, question:

00:03:42.815 --> 00:03:46.505
Why are you and TED
interested in participating

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:49.713
and actually activating
the climate agenda,

00:03:49.737 --> 00:03:53.370
when I thought you were
all about spreading ideas?

00:03:53.394 --> 00:03:57.498
CA: Well, indeed, that has been
our focused mission for the last 15 years,

00:03:57.522 --> 00:03:58.988
Ideas Worth Spreading.

00:04:00.022 --> 00:04:01.268
But last summer,

00:04:01.292 --> 00:04:04.450
we concluded that the urgency
of some issues,

00:04:04.474 --> 00:04:06.014
and especially climate,

00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:09.014
demanded that we try to do more
than just spread ideas,

00:04:09.038 --> 00:04:11.910
that we actually try to activate them.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.839
Now, we're just a relatively
small nonprofit --

00:04:15.863 --> 00:04:20.172
that would not amount to anything
if we fail to bring other people on board.

00:04:20.196 --> 00:04:22.895
But the amazing thing
is that that has happened.

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.799
Everyone we've spoken to about this
has got excited about participating.

00:04:28.284 --> 00:04:32.389
And one of the key moments, frankly,
was when you came on board, Christiana.

00:04:32.413 --> 00:04:36.540
I mean, you were key
to the Paris Agreement.

00:04:36.564 --> 00:04:39.905
And the world was stunned
at the consensus that emerged there.

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:43.012
What was the key to creating
that consensus?

00:04:43.036 --> 00:04:48.203
CF: I would say it was to really challenge
and change people's assumption

00:04:48.227 --> 00:04:53.101
about what is possible
if we set a shared intention

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:57.394
and then collectively
pursue it and achieve it.

00:04:57.736 --> 00:05:01.617
So our mantra then, and continues to be:

00:05:01.641 --> 00:05:04.728
"Impossible is not a fact,

00:05:04.752 --> 00:05:06.331
it's an attitude."

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:08.339
In fact, only an attitude,

00:05:08.363 --> 00:05:10.763
and that is something we can change.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.626
CA: Well, that mantra, certainly,
we're going to have to hold onto

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.824
in the months ahead,

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:19.250
because the scientific consensus
is actually worsening.

00:05:19.989 --> 00:05:21.910
For a quick report from the front lines,

00:05:21.934 --> 00:05:24.373
here's the head
of the thousands of scientists

00:05:24.397 --> 00:05:27.909
who make up the IPCC, Dr. Hoesung Lee.

00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:33.446
(Video) Hoesung Lee: We recently released
three special reports

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.352
that show the damage and risks
of past and future climate change.

00:05:38.376 --> 00:05:41.291
They also show that stabilizing climate

00:05:41.315 --> 00:05:44.522
would imply a drastic reduction
in greenhouse gas emissions

00:05:44.546 --> 00:05:45.696
in the near term.

00:05:46.062 --> 00:05:49.863
Society will have to go
through unprecedented changes

00:05:49.887 --> 00:05:51.087
to meet this goal.

00:05:51.442 --> 00:05:54.752
Even limiting warming
to 1.5 degrees Celsius

00:05:54.776 --> 00:05:57.870
will bring more extreme weather,

00:05:58.403 --> 00:06:00.093
rising sea levels

00:06:00.117 --> 00:06:02.966
and water shortages in some regions,

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.362
and threats to food security
and biodiversity.

00:06:06.386 --> 00:06:10.595
Higher temperature will bring
more of these damages,

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:13.190
threatening lives and livelihoods

00:06:13.214 --> 00:06:16.147
of millions of people
all around the world.

00:06:16.952 --> 00:06:19.974
CA: We're lucky to have with us
another world-leading scientist,

00:06:19.998 --> 00:06:21.625
Johan Rockström here.

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:26.053
He was responsible for creating
the Planetary Boundaries framework.

00:06:26.546 --> 00:06:29.886
Johan, how serious is our situation?

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.092
(Video) Johan Rockström: Last week,
we released in "Nature"

00:06:34.116 --> 00:06:37.338
the 10-year update of the risk
of crossing tipping points,

00:06:37.362 --> 00:06:40.006
irreversible tipping points,
in the Earth system.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.721
We know 15 such tipping points,

00:06:42.745 --> 00:06:45.466
including the Greenland
and West Antarctic ice shelf,

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.617
and the permafrost
in the Siberian tundra, for example,

00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:50.625
and we today have observational evidence,

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:51.989
I mean, empirical evidence,

00:06:52.013 --> 00:06:55.935
that nine of the 15 have woken up
and are on the move.

00:06:56.391 --> 00:06:58.344
We haven't crossed the tipping point yet,

00:06:58.368 --> 00:06:59.591
the window is still open,

00:06:59.615 --> 00:07:02.709
but they are warning us
that now is the time to truly move,

00:07:02.733 --> 00:07:04.550
because the moment we cross them,

00:07:04.574 --> 00:07:08.390
like, for example, approaching
a tipping point in the Amazon rain forest,

00:07:08.414 --> 00:07:10.881
we would risk losing the battle,

00:07:10.905 --> 00:07:14.676
because the planet will be taking over
its self-reinforced warming.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.096
So that is why this initiative
is so incredibly important.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.318
Let's go.

00:07:19.342 --> 00:07:20.492
CA: Well said.

00:07:20.516 --> 00:07:21.695
(Applause)

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:26.183
So, both are very clear there
that this agenda of cutting emissions

00:07:26.207 --> 00:07:28.052
is absolutely crucial.

00:07:28.076 --> 00:07:29.276
How has that been going?

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.887
CF: Not very well,
because despite what we know,

00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:34.014
despite everything
that science has told us,

00:07:34.038 --> 00:07:35.805
despite everything that we have done,

00:07:35.829 --> 00:07:37.744
including adopting the Paris Agreement,

00:07:37.768 --> 00:07:42.974
we've actually been increasing
greenhouse gases consistently

00:07:42.998 --> 00:07:44.451
over the past few decades,

00:07:44.475 --> 00:07:47.760
to the point where
we're now at 55 gigatons

00:07:47.784 --> 00:07:49.466
of carbon dioxide equivalent

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:53.796
that we are collectively, as humanity,
emitting every year.

00:07:54.725 --> 00:07:58.469
And as we have heard, we have one path,

00:07:58.493 --> 00:08:01.391
there is one path
that we have to follow, and that is:

00:08:01.415 --> 00:08:03.946
Start now to decrease emissions,

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.578
instead of going up, go down --

00:08:05.602 --> 00:08:07.869
reverse the trend, bend the curve.

00:08:08.601 --> 00:08:10.998
Reduce emissions, starting in 2020,

00:08:11.022 --> 00:08:16.744
to the point where we will be at one half
the current level of emissions by 2030,

00:08:16.768 --> 00:08:22.443
and then continue decreasing them,
until we are at net zero by 2050.

00:08:22.467 --> 00:08:24.879
It's the only path that we can accept.

00:08:24.903 --> 00:08:28.806
CA: How do you even begin to start
tackling a goal as daunting as that?

00:08:29.157 --> 00:08:33.331
CF: Well, we could starting by breaking

00:08:33.355 --> 00:08:36.498
the simple, yet daunting, challenge

00:08:36.522 --> 00:08:38.768
into its constituent pieces,

00:08:38.792 --> 00:08:40.211
five main areas.

00:08:42.066 --> 00:08:47.161
CA: And so these five together
are actually all huge,

00:08:47.185 --> 00:08:50.446
and if we can find compelling
solutions in each of them,

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:54.040
they would actually add up
to an action plan

00:08:54.064 --> 00:08:56.597
that matches the scale of the problem.

00:08:57.365 --> 00:08:58.965
Well, here are the five.

00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:02.261
CF: Power.

00:09:02.934 --> 00:09:07.365
How rapidly can we move
to 100 percent clean energy?

00:09:08.007 --> 00:09:09.460
CA: The built environment.

00:09:09.484 --> 00:09:13.769
How can we re-engineer
the stuff that surrounds us?

00:09:14.793 --> 00:09:15.943
CF: Transport.

00:09:16.252 --> 00:09:21.823
How do we transform the ways
we move -- ourselves and goods?

00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:23.878
CA: Food.

00:09:24.323 --> 00:09:28.997
How can we spark a worldwide shift
to healthier food systems?

00:09:29.567 --> 00:09:31.499
CF: And certainly, nature.

00:09:31.868 --> 00:09:35.918
How extensively can we re-green the earth?

00:09:36.662 --> 00:09:40.865
Now, it's worth noting
that the answers to these questions

00:09:40.889 --> 00:09:43.252
and the measures that we would undertake

00:09:43.276 --> 00:09:45.950
don't just reduce net emissions --

00:09:45.974 --> 00:09:49.220
they do that, certainly,
together, to zero --

00:09:49.244 --> 00:09:51.823
but they also point the way to a future

00:09:51.847 --> 00:09:55.950
that is much better
and genuinely exciting.

00:09:55.974 --> 00:10:00.355
So, think about cool
new forms of transport,

00:10:00.379 --> 00:10:04.543
clean air, healthier food,
beautiful forests

00:10:04.567 --> 00:10:07.511
and oceans bursting with life.

00:10:08.268 --> 00:10:10.713
So, you know, solving the climate crisis

00:10:10.737 --> 00:10:15.681
isn't about sacrificing
and settling for a mediocre future,

00:10:15.705 --> 00:10:18.015
it's about the exact opposite.

00:10:18.039 --> 00:10:21.824
It's about co-creating
a much better future for all of us.

00:10:22.804 --> 00:10:25.717
CA: So how do we tackle these questions?

00:10:25.741 --> 00:10:26.931
(Laughter)

00:10:26.955 --> 00:10:30.717
CA: Let's take this question here
and think about this.

00:10:30.741 --> 00:10:33.028
How extensively can we re-green the earth?

00:10:33.052 --> 00:10:36.299
I mean, there are obviously
many responses to this question,

00:10:36.323 --> 00:10:37.474
many proposals.

00:10:37.498 --> 00:10:38.728
It's fundamentally about,

00:10:38.752 --> 00:10:42.410
"How do we increase the amount
of sustainable photosynthesis

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:43.585
on planet Earth."

00:10:43.609 --> 00:10:46.085
Photosynthesis sequesters carbon.

00:10:46.109 --> 00:10:50.656
There could be proposals
around giant kelp forests or seagrass,

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.815
or about forms of plants
that have deeper roots

00:10:53.839 --> 00:10:56.856
and can sequester across the planet.

00:10:57.785 --> 00:11:02.499
But suppose a major proposal that came out
was about reforestation.

00:11:02.523 --> 00:11:07.183
A massive, global reforestation campaign.

00:11:07.498 --> 00:11:10.649
I mean, a single organization,
no matter how big,

00:11:10.673 --> 00:11:12.926
cannot take that on.

00:11:13.815 --> 00:11:16.291
The key is for everyone to join forces,

00:11:16.315 --> 00:11:17.831
for governments (with zoning),

00:11:17.855 --> 00:11:19.172
businesses to invest,

00:11:19.196 --> 00:11:20.979
investors to do that investing,

00:11:21.003 --> 00:11:24.122
environmental groups
and philanthropists who support them,

00:11:24.146 --> 00:11:28.836
and just a massive movement
among citizens everywhere,

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.710
transforming their lawns, their cities,
their neighborhoods,

00:11:31.734 --> 00:11:32.910
going on trips together.

00:11:32.934 --> 00:11:37.091
That is where, suddenly,
you can dream about something really big.

00:11:37.538 --> 00:11:39.593
CF: So can we test that theory?

00:11:39.617 --> 00:11:42.744
Because we are fortunate
to have with us today

00:11:42.768 --> 00:11:47.649
someone who grew up inside
a tree-planting movement,

00:11:47.673 --> 00:11:50.609
probably the most well-recognized
tree-planting movement.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.037
And she is the daughter
of the Nobel Prize winner

00:11:54.061 --> 00:11:55.260
Wangari Maathai,

00:11:55.284 --> 00:11:58.640
and she heads up the Wangari Maathai
Foundation today.

00:11:58.942 --> 00:12:03.239
So can we invite our very dear
friend Wanjira Mathai?

00:12:03.263 --> 00:12:05.366
(Applause)

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:07.490
(Video) Wanjira Mathai:
Thank you very much,

00:12:07.514 --> 00:12:09.300
Christiana and Chris, for doing this.

00:12:09.324 --> 00:12:13.283
Trees have been, indeed, a part of my life
for as long as I can remember,

00:12:13.307 --> 00:12:15.537
but we also know that for centuries,

00:12:15.561 --> 00:12:20.742
trees and forests have cushioned us
against the harsh impacts

00:12:20.766 --> 00:12:22.076
of climate variation

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.648
for very many years.

00:12:23.672 --> 00:12:24.965
In my lifetime, my mother,

00:12:24.989 --> 00:12:27.727
through the Green Belt Movement,
as you mentioned,

00:12:27.751 --> 00:12:32.745
inspired the planting
of 50 million trees and counting

00:12:32.769 --> 00:12:35.704
through the work of the Green
Belt Movement, one organization.

00:12:35.728 --> 00:12:37.904
But the world now needs us

00:12:37.928 --> 00:12:43.061
to plant 100 times more trees
than we did then.

00:12:43.085 --> 00:12:47.482
And the only way to do that
is for all of us to come together --

00:12:47.506 --> 00:12:52.704
cities, citizens, governments,
companies, environmental organizations --

00:12:52.728 --> 00:12:55.220
and we must believe, therefore,

00:12:55.244 --> 00:12:59.585
in the capacity for each of us
to be potent agents of change.

00:12:59.609 --> 00:13:02.440
And that together, we are a force.

00:13:02.464 --> 00:13:05.804
And I hope you will all join us.

00:13:05.828 --> 00:13:06.978
(Applause)

00:13:07.002 --> 00:13:08.558
CF: So together we are a force.

00:13:08.582 --> 00:13:11.178
I think Wanjira really hits it
right there on the head,

00:13:11.202 --> 00:13:13.205
because it's all about collaborating

00:13:13.229 --> 00:13:16.736
across a pretty broad spectrum of people.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:22.347
And happily, there are representatives
from all of those groups here today.

00:13:22.673 --> 00:13:26.118
And we will be inviting you
toward further engagement.

00:13:26.142 --> 00:13:30.360
But we wanted today to introduce you
to a couple of those people,

00:13:30.384 --> 00:13:32.789
speaking from their own perspective.

00:13:32.813 --> 00:13:36.365
So we would like to start
with the voice of a politician.

00:13:36.749 --> 00:13:39.997
We are incredibly honored
to have with us today

00:13:40.021 --> 00:13:42.505
the former prime minister of Bhutan,

00:13:42.529 --> 00:13:46.236
and I will have you know that Bhutan
is the only country in the world

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.959
that actually absorbs more carbon
than what it emits.

00:13:50.284 --> 00:13:52.593
Our good friend, Tshering Tobgay.

00:13:52.617 --> 00:13:59.617
(Applause)

00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:07.613
Tshering Tobgay: My country
is typical of the global south,

00:14:07.637 --> 00:14:12.299
in that we have not caused
this climate-change crisis.

00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:16.053
Indeed, we are blessed

00:14:16.077 --> 00:14:19.403
with lush forests
and many bountiful rivers

00:14:19.427 --> 00:14:23.417
that have enabled my country, Bhutan,
to remain carbon-negative.

00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:29.187
And yet, climate change
threatens to destroy our forests.

00:14:29.966 --> 00:14:32.473
And to turn those very rivers

00:14:33.713 --> 00:14:36.347
into terrible dangers for our people,

00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:41.394
as the Himalayan glaciers melt
and threaten both near-term flooding

00:14:42.109 --> 00:14:47.277
and the longer-term loss
of our natural water reserves.

00:14:48.458 --> 00:14:52.903
So, I'm proud to join

00:14:52.927 --> 00:14:55.403
this Countdown initiative

00:14:55.427 --> 00:14:58.426
and work with all of you
and with you, and with you,

00:14:58.450 --> 00:14:59.609
(Laughter)

00:14:59.633 --> 00:15:05.327
constructively, to find solutions
that are both powerful and just.

00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:07.268
Thank you.

00:15:07.292 --> 00:15:09.136
(Applause)

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.395
CA: Thank you.

00:15:10.419 --> 00:15:14.297
(Applause)

00:15:14.321 --> 00:15:16.853
CA: Business, of course,
has a crucial role to play,

00:15:16.877 --> 00:15:21.734
and so do those who control the world's
vast pools of investment capital.

00:15:21.758 --> 00:15:24.109
I was pleased to make
the acquaintance recently

00:15:24.133 --> 00:15:25.943
of the chief investment officer

00:15:25.967 --> 00:15:30.585
of Japan's 1.6-trillion-dollar
government pension fund.

00:15:30.609 --> 00:15:33.348
It's actually the world's
largest pension fund.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.064
He's willing and interested
to come with us on this journey

00:15:37.088 --> 00:15:38.687
and to bring others with him.

00:15:38.711 --> 00:15:42.972
So, somewhere is, I believe, Hiro.

00:15:42.996 --> 00:15:44.155
Hiro Mizuno.

00:15:44.179 --> 00:15:46.179
And you're live. Welcome, Hiro.

00:15:47.377 --> 00:15:48.680
(Video) Hiro Mizuno: Great.

00:15:48.704 --> 00:15:52.307
Thanks, Chris and Christiana,
and the staff of TED,

00:15:52.331 --> 00:15:54.220
for making this possible.

00:15:54.244 --> 00:15:57.976
As a person in charge
of the largest pension fund in the world

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.595
and responsible for securing pension
benefits for multiple generations,

00:16:03.619 --> 00:16:07.113
it is a hugely important issue,
how to manage climate risk.

00:16:07.911 --> 00:16:10.355
We recently analyzed our global portfolio,

00:16:10.379 --> 00:16:12.998
how it's aligned with the Paris Agreement.

00:16:13.022 --> 00:16:14.411
It was diagnosed,

00:16:14.435 --> 00:16:18.092
our portfolio is on the path
for more than three degrees.

00:16:18.116 --> 00:16:20.939
Far away from the Paris Agreement goals.

00:16:21.741 --> 00:16:24.328
Our portfolio is not only sizable

00:16:24.352 --> 00:16:28.098
but also one of the most
globally diversified portfolios.

00:16:28.122 --> 00:16:30.706
So that means, the world is on that path.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.347
I'm tired of hearing
the same comment repeatedly

00:16:34.371 --> 00:16:39.061
from our portfolio companies
and, obviously, investment professionals:

00:16:39.085 --> 00:16:40.352
"We are realistic."

00:16:41.196 --> 00:16:44.648
Sorry, but being "realistic"
is no longer an option.

00:16:45.395 --> 00:16:50.394
We are fully aware of our responsibility
as the world's largest asset owner

00:16:50.418 --> 00:16:53.141
to inspire changes in the capital market.

00:16:53.165 --> 00:16:57.768
We will be actively engaging
with all actors in the capital market

00:16:57.792 --> 00:16:59.283
to move the needle.

00:16:59.887 --> 00:17:04.244
I look forward to participating
in this crucial dialogue with you all.

00:17:04.268 --> 00:17:05.601
Thank you.

00:17:05.625 --> 00:17:07.664
(Applause)

00:17:07.688 --> 00:17:12.403
CF: I'm sure all of you know
that throughout the past 12 to 18 months,

00:17:12.427 --> 00:17:16.641
what has really been new
and powerful and exciting

00:17:16.665 --> 00:17:19.863
is the amazing voices
of so many young people,

00:17:19.887 --> 00:17:22.867
millions of young people
who are out there on the streets,

00:17:22.891 --> 00:17:24.763
with anger, with outrage, with despair,

00:17:24.787 --> 00:17:27.009
and also, asking us to do our thing.

00:17:28.002 --> 00:17:30.533
And they have been inspired
by Greta Thunberg

00:17:30.557 --> 00:17:33.995
but by so many other
fantastic young people

00:17:34.019 --> 00:17:35.884
in almost every country of the world.

00:17:35.908 --> 00:17:40.577
And today, we are delighted to have
four young activists

00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:42.663
come join us today.

00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:45.647
(Applause)

00:17:45.671 --> 00:17:47.502
(Cheers)

00:17:47.526 --> 00:17:54.526
(Applause)

00:17:55.959 --> 00:17:57.681
Alexandria Villaseñor: This Friday,

00:17:57.705 --> 00:18:00.181
I'll have been
on climate strike for 52 weeks.

00:18:00.205 --> 00:18:01.879
That's an entire year.

00:18:02.435 --> 00:18:03.657
During that time,

00:18:03.681 --> 00:18:06.418
I found that many people
don't know about climate change

00:18:06.442 --> 00:18:08.918
or how serious the climate crisis is.

00:18:08.942 --> 00:18:11.498
So I founded Earth Uprising International

00:18:11.522 --> 00:18:14.133
to teach young people
about climate change,

00:18:14.157 --> 00:18:17.323
because when they know
the science and the impacts,

00:18:17.347 --> 00:18:19.014
they want to take action.

00:18:19.498 --> 00:18:22.497
Being an activist
means making change happen.

00:18:23.077 --> 00:18:25.077
Jamie Margolin:
I became a climate activist

00:18:25.101 --> 00:18:26.807
because my life depends on it.

00:18:26.831 --> 00:18:28.498
I'm applying to colleges right now,

00:18:28.522 --> 00:18:30.236
trying to plan for my future.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.188
There will be nothing to look forward to

00:18:32.212 --> 00:18:35.172
if we don't take urgent action
to stop the climate crisis now.

00:18:35.803 --> 00:18:40.874
I started the youth climate justice
movement called Zero Hour back in 2017,

00:18:40.898 --> 00:18:44.279
because this is zero hour
to act on climate change.

00:18:44.303 --> 00:18:45.835
We have no more time.

00:18:45.859 --> 00:18:47.014
It became clear to me

00:18:47.038 --> 00:18:49.474
that our leaders were not
going to take real action

00:18:49.498 --> 00:18:51.537
unless the people stood up
and demanded it,

00:18:51.561 --> 00:18:53.815
so that's exactly what we did.

00:18:53.839 --> 00:18:56.211
Natalie Sweet: I became
a climate-justice activist

00:18:56.235 --> 00:18:59.481
because if I don't fight
for the rights of the people today,

00:18:59.505 --> 00:19:01.084
and for the people in the future,

00:19:01.108 --> 00:19:02.258
who will?

00:19:02.282 --> 00:19:04.893
Xiye Bastida: I became
a climate justice activist

00:19:04.917 --> 00:19:09.474
when I realized that the climate crisis
impacts marginalized communities the most,

00:19:09.498 --> 00:19:11.617
including my town in Mexico.

00:19:11.641 --> 00:19:13.724
I strike with Fridays for Future

00:19:13.748 --> 00:19:14.909
every Friday,

00:19:14.933 --> 00:19:17.804
because our movement
is not about gaining momentum

00:19:17.828 --> 00:19:20.311
but about igniting cultural change.

00:19:20.335 --> 00:19:24.473
But the fact that thousands
of students strike for climate

00:19:24.497 --> 00:19:27.172
means that we are already
implementing climate justice

00:19:27.196 --> 00:19:29.418
into every aspect of our lives,

00:19:29.442 --> 00:19:31.726
which is already redefining the world.

00:19:32.398 --> 00:19:34.168
JM: Over the course of our lifetimes,

00:19:34.192 --> 00:19:37.191
we've seen the Earth deteriorate
at a rapid speed

00:19:37.215 --> 00:19:39.618
and groups of people
traumatized and displaced

00:19:39.642 --> 00:19:42.477
by an ever-increasing number
of natural disasters.

00:19:42.905 --> 00:19:45.421
In 2030, I'll be 28 years old.

00:19:46.001 --> 00:19:47.833
AV: I'll be 24 years old.

00:19:48.152 --> 00:19:49.707
XB: I will be 27.

00:19:50.103 --> 00:19:51.540
NS: I'll be 26.

00:19:51.564 --> 00:19:54.669
We want to be able to hand
the planet over to our children

00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:56.224
and our children's children,

00:19:56.248 --> 00:19:58.724
just like many of you
have been able to do.

00:19:59.193 --> 00:20:01.097
AV: So unless everyone --

00:20:01.121 --> 00:20:05.855
governments, companies, schools,
scientists and citizens --

00:20:05.879 --> 00:20:10.442
make a united commitment
to reversing the damage that we've caused,

00:20:10.466 --> 00:20:12.466
it will be too late.

00:20:13.644 --> 00:20:16.882
XB: We are not only asking you
to take care of our future,

00:20:16.906 --> 00:20:19.844
we are also asking you
to take care of our past.

00:20:20.183 --> 00:20:24.982
Indigenous people have been taking care
of the Earth for thousands of years,

00:20:25.006 --> 00:20:28.291
which is why indigenous
philosophy is crucial

00:20:28.315 --> 00:20:30.515
when implementing climate action.

00:20:32.427 --> 00:20:36.053
JM: This climate crisis can feel
like an impossible thing to fix.

00:20:36.077 --> 00:20:37.239
But it's not.

00:20:37.263 --> 00:20:38.415
And it can't be,

00:20:38.439 --> 00:20:40.363
because failure is simply not an option.

00:20:40.387 --> 00:20:42.412
Failure means losing everything we love

00:20:42.436 --> 00:20:44.315
and everything that matters.

00:20:44.339 --> 00:20:47.720
So many of us are already working
to save the future of our world,

00:20:47.744 --> 00:20:50.712
but it can't just be
on the next generation to fix.

00:20:50.736 --> 00:20:54.204
This is too much of a burden
to just put on young people's shoulders.

00:20:54.982 --> 00:20:57.768
It is time for you to go all hands on deck

00:20:57.792 --> 00:21:02.434
and do everything within your power
to save everything before it's too late.

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.950
Are you with us?

00:21:04.519 --> 00:21:05.682
Audience: Yes.

00:21:05.706 --> 00:21:12.706
(Applause and cheers)

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:19.373
(Applause)

00:21:19.397 --> 00:21:21.299
CA: Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

00:21:21.323 --> 00:21:22.477
And then, of course,

00:21:22.501 --> 00:21:26.371
there's a crucial role to be played
by the world's storytellers,

00:21:26.395 --> 00:21:30.704
and those with influence
on social media platforms.

00:21:30.728 --> 00:21:32.887
Each of the following
has expressed excitement

00:21:32.911 --> 00:21:34.204
to be part of this project.

00:21:34.228 --> 00:21:36.141
They've lent us their names and support.

00:21:36.165 --> 00:21:37.728
We have some of them here today.

00:21:37.752 --> 00:21:39.885
Thank you so much for being here.

00:21:40.228 --> 00:21:42.649
And let's hear from one of them, actually.

00:21:42.673 --> 00:21:44.355
Jimmy Kimmel: Hi, I'm Jimmy Kimmel,

00:21:44.379 --> 00:21:47.655
and I was asked to explain
why I'm passionate about climate change.

00:21:47.679 --> 00:21:50.306
And the reason I'm passionate
about climate change

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:55.274
is the same reason people who are drowning
are passionate about lifeguards.

00:21:55.298 --> 00:21:58.331
I care about this planet,
because I live on it.

00:21:58.355 --> 00:21:59.879
I don't want to move to Mars,

00:21:59.903 --> 00:22:01.196
Mars seems terrible.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.744
I want my kids and their kids
to be able to live on Earth,

00:22:04.768 --> 00:22:07.561
with air they can breathe
and water they can drink.

00:22:07.585 --> 00:22:10.291
That's why I care about climate change.

00:22:10.315 --> 00:22:13.006
And also, I have a crush
on Leonardo DiCaprio.

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.752
(Applause)

00:22:15.776 --> 00:22:18.279
CF: So with all these
people coming together,

00:22:18.303 --> 00:22:22.537
we have an opportunity to explore
a new space of possibility

00:22:22.561 --> 00:22:25.672
for solutions based on working together,

00:22:25.696 --> 00:22:27.204
challenging each other

00:22:27.228 --> 00:22:29.124
and inspiring one another.

00:22:29.466 --> 00:22:31.490
So in October next year,

00:22:31.514 --> 00:22:35.149
we will be inviting
more or less 1,000 people

00:22:35.173 --> 00:22:39.728
from different constituencies
to meet in Bergen, Norway

00:22:39.752 --> 00:22:44.886
to align on specific answers
to our five big questions.

00:22:45.395 --> 00:22:47.995
CA: It will certainly be an epic event.

00:22:48.482 --> 00:22:50.990
But even more significant
than what happens in Norway

00:22:51.014 --> 00:22:53.855
is what happens elsewhere in the world.

00:22:53.879 --> 00:22:55.934
Because on the final day
of that conference,

00:22:55.958 --> 00:23:00.577
we're planning a major activation
of our global TEDx community.

00:23:01.315 --> 00:23:05.216
TEDx allows initiatives
to organize local events,

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.321
and there are now
4,000 such events annually.

00:23:08.345 --> 00:23:10.145
Here's what they look like.

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:15.505
They take place in more than 200
different countries,

00:23:15.529 --> 00:23:18.339
generate more than a billion views
annually on YouTube.

00:23:18.363 --> 00:23:21.006
We're expecting to see events
in hundreds of cities.

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.213
We'll be connecting our TEDx organizers

00:23:23.237 --> 00:23:27.791
with city mayors committed
to a clean future for their cities.

00:23:27.815 --> 00:23:29.053
This is the key to this.

00:23:29.077 --> 00:23:31.100
It's this connection between the powerful,

00:23:31.124 --> 00:23:34.013
who usually own the conversation,

00:23:34.037 --> 00:23:35.973
and millions of people around the world.

00:23:35.997 --> 00:23:39.640
Because of the zeitgeist shift
that's happened in the last year or two,

00:23:39.664 --> 00:23:42.077
suddenly, ignition can happen here,

00:23:42.101 --> 00:23:44.180
because there's enough
critical groundswell.

00:23:44.204 --> 00:23:46.442
If we can give people
visibility of each other,

00:23:46.466 --> 00:23:47.704
connection to each other,

00:23:47.728 --> 00:23:49.379
let's dream a little here,

00:23:49.403 --> 00:23:51.347
and give each other permission to dream.

00:23:51.371 --> 00:23:54.529
CF: So our goal here
is to build connections

00:23:54.553 --> 00:23:59.117
with and among all of the other
organizations that are working on climate.

00:23:59.141 --> 00:24:00.292
For example,

00:24:00.316 --> 00:24:02.648
the Solutions Project
is a wonderful initiative

00:24:02.672 --> 00:24:05.733
founded by Mark Ruffalo and Don Cheadle.

00:24:06.347 --> 00:24:10.212
And let's hear from some of the leaders
that they have supported.

00:24:10.236 --> 00:24:11.934
CA: Welcome, you're live.

00:24:11.958 --> 00:24:12.989
(Laughter)

00:24:13.013 --> 00:24:16.751
(Video) Wahleah Johns:
Hi, my name is Wahleah Johns,

00:24:16.775 --> 00:24:18.498
I'm with Native Renewables,

00:24:18.522 --> 00:24:24.045
and we are working to provide
solar power for tribes

00:24:24.069 --> 00:24:25.712
throughout the world.

00:24:25.736 --> 00:24:29.712
We have over 15,000
Native American families

00:24:29.736 --> 00:24:32.329
that don't have access to electricity,

00:24:32.353 --> 00:24:37.266
and we are working to provide solar
plus battery storage for these families

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:38.536
in the United States

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.950
that don't have access to electricity.

00:24:40.974 --> 00:24:43.506
And they are located on my reservation,

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:44.730
the Navajo Nation.

00:24:45.411 --> 00:24:46.799
Anna Lappé: Hi, everyone,

00:24:46.823 --> 00:24:49.616
I am Anna Lappé with Real Food Media,

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:54.045
and we work to uplift the stories
of farmers and ranchers

00:24:54.069 --> 00:24:56.942
as a key solution to the climate crisis.

00:24:56.966 --> 00:25:00.633
The global food system right now
is a huge contributor to this crisis,

00:25:00.657 --> 00:25:02.156
but it doesn't have to be.

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:03.831
Farmers and ranchers we really see

00:25:03.855 --> 00:25:07.235
as on the front lines
of being part of solving the crisis.

00:25:07.259 --> 00:25:11.873
So we try to share the stories
of the millions of farmers

00:25:11.897 --> 00:25:15.230
from Andhra Pradesh, India
to the highlands of Oaxaca

00:25:15.254 --> 00:25:20.768
that are using regenerative agriculture
to build healthy, carbon-rich soil,

00:25:20.792 --> 00:25:21.983
grow good food

00:25:22.007 --> 00:25:26.108
and foster the kind of resilient
communities that we need.

00:25:27.736 --> 00:25:30.865
Rahwa Ghirmatzion: Hello
from PUSH Buffalo -- my name is Rahwa --

00:25:30.889 --> 00:25:34.966
where every day, residents
are visioning, planning and designing

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:38.093
an equitable, holistic
and sacred neighborhood,

00:25:38.117 --> 00:25:41.538
like where I'm phoning in from, School 77,

00:25:41.562 --> 00:25:43.831
a renovated vacant school building

00:25:43.855 --> 00:25:48.673
that has the first 100 percent
affordable community solar array

00:25:48.697 --> 00:25:49.895
in New York state

00:25:49.919 --> 00:25:51.807
installed by local residents.

00:25:51.831 --> 00:25:55.450
It's also serving 30 affordable
senior apartments

00:25:55.474 --> 00:25:58.863
and a mix of intergenerational spaces

00:25:58.887 --> 00:26:00.847
that serves as a community hub,

00:26:00.871 --> 00:26:03.347
where we're practicing
new economy strategies

00:26:03.371 --> 00:26:05.038
towards a livable planet.

00:26:06.006 --> 00:26:07.157
CF: Thank you.

00:26:07.181 --> 00:26:08.466
CA: Bravo.

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:11.269
(Applause)

00:26:11.293 --> 00:26:12.491
CA: It's so great.

00:26:12.515 --> 00:26:13.725
(Applause)

00:26:13.749 --> 00:26:15.648
CF: So you see, this is about everyone.

00:26:15.672 --> 00:26:16.826
It's about cities,

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:19.074
it's about grassroots organizations,

00:26:19.098 --> 00:26:21.489
but it's also, of course, about business.

00:26:21.879 --> 00:26:24.545
And so we're inviting all companies --

00:26:24.569 --> 00:26:26.268
underlined "all" --

00:26:26.292 --> 00:26:27.918
to join this initiative,

00:26:27.942 --> 00:26:32.910
to engage with your employees
on how you can best protect the planet

00:26:32.934 --> 00:26:35.714
and your future, at the same time.

00:26:36.188 --> 00:26:39.506
So early next year,
we'll be sharing a toolkit

00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:41.256
that can guide companies

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:45.403
toward moving quickly
towards science-based targets,

00:26:45.427 --> 00:26:49.863
which gets them then to net zero emissions

00:26:49.887 --> 00:26:52.594
by 2050 at the latest.

00:26:53.307 --> 00:26:54.498
CA: So think about this,

00:26:54.522 --> 00:26:56.617
because as an individual,

00:26:56.641 --> 00:27:00.553
many individuals
feel powerless on this issue.

00:27:00.577 --> 00:27:05.497
But if you were to team up
with others in your company,

00:27:05.521 --> 00:27:08.187
you might be amazed at how much
power you actually have.

00:27:08.211 --> 00:27:13.489
Almost all emissions come from
a company somewhere on the planet.

00:27:13.513 --> 00:27:16.536
And the thing is, many CEOs today

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.473
are actually eager
to help solve the problem.

00:27:19.497 --> 00:27:24.172
We just heard this morning
from Anand Mahindra,

00:27:24.196 --> 00:27:26.569
who heads India's biggest business group,

00:27:26.593 --> 00:27:28.799
that he is personally
committed on this issue

00:27:28.823 --> 00:27:31.029
and wants to be part
of this journey with us --

00:27:31.053 --> 00:27:32.683
he's a supporter of Countdown.

00:27:33.434 --> 00:27:36.492
CEOs will be able to move much faster

00:27:36.516 --> 00:27:42.768
if there's a group of employees there
to brainstorm with, to support them,

00:27:42.792 --> 00:27:47.501
to keep that sort of sense
of urgency on the topic.

00:27:47.929 --> 00:27:51.691
Our website will help you connect
with others in your company

00:27:51.715 --> 00:27:54.762
and give you guidance
on smart questions to ask,

00:27:54.786 --> 00:27:56.723
initiatives to suggest,

00:27:56.747 --> 00:28:00.828
because if companies can be persuaded
to do the right thing,

00:28:00.852 --> 00:28:04.794
suddenly, this problem
seems to become solvable.

00:28:05.533 --> 00:28:10.838
CF: So all of these efforts are building
toward one fantastic day:

00:28:10.838 --> 00:28:13.974
Saturday, October 10, 2020 --

00:28:13.998 --> 00:28:18.910
that is, "10.10.2020." --
easy to remember --

00:28:18.934 --> 00:28:22.783
when this fantastic gathering
will take place around the world.

00:28:23.284 --> 00:28:25.958
And we hope to have, by then,

00:28:25.982 --> 00:28:29.434
thrilling news of the report
of the very specific solutions

00:28:29.458 --> 00:28:33.798
that nations, cities, companies, citizens

00:28:33.822 --> 00:28:36.848
are actually already
collaborating on by then.

00:28:37.326 --> 00:28:40.540
It's a day when every
citizen of the planet

00:28:40.564 --> 00:28:42.625
is invited to participate.

00:28:42.649 --> 00:28:46.839
Your one ticket of entrance
is you are a citizen of the planet.

00:28:46.863 --> 00:28:51.873
CA: Key to the success of the event
is for this to happen at scale.

00:28:51.897 --> 00:28:54.524
We want to make it easy
for anyone and everyone

00:28:54.548 --> 00:28:57.880
to find out about the initiative
and to play an active part in it.

00:28:57.904 --> 00:28:59.190
But how do you do that?

00:28:59.214 --> 00:29:01.283
You know, the world's a noisy place.

00:29:01.307 --> 00:29:03.950
I mean, the TED platform
can help a bit, maybe,

00:29:03.974 --> 00:29:07.641
but there's a much bigger
content platform out there.

00:29:07.665 --> 00:29:09.901
It's called YouTube.

00:29:10.249 --> 00:29:13.939
And we're delighted to be working
with them on this endeavor.

00:29:13.963 --> 00:29:16.368
We'll be inviting
many of their top creators

00:29:16.392 --> 00:29:18.600
to be part of Countdown.

00:29:19.257 --> 00:29:22.280
Collectively, they could reach
an audience in the many millions.

00:29:22.304 --> 00:29:23.842
In fact, let's meet one of them,

00:29:23.866 --> 00:29:25.835
Dr. Joe Hanson of "Hot Mess,"

00:29:25.859 --> 00:29:29.954
a new web series about the impact
of climate change on all of us.

00:29:31.284 --> 00:29:33.260
(Video) My name's Joe Hanson,

00:29:33.284 --> 00:29:34.637
and I am a YouTube educator.

00:29:34.661 --> 00:29:36.601
And you can count me in.

00:29:36.625 --> 00:29:40.111
I work with tomorrow's scientists,
inventors and leaders,

00:29:40.135 --> 00:29:43.687
and they deserve to know the truth
of what the science says,

00:29:43.711 --> 00:29:47.804
so that they can help us invent
a better future for everyone.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.840
CA: Imagine that multiplied
by many others --

00:29:51.864 --> 00:29:53.889
it's very, very exciting, honestly.

00:29:54.561 --> 00:29:57.609
CF: And of course, when it comes
to spreading the word,

00:29:57.633 --> 00:30:01.594
every one of you in this room
can actually play your part.

00:30:02.014 --> 00:30:05.517
So if you have any way of reaching anyone

00:30:05.541 --> 00:30:08.259
who is concerned
about building a better future --

00:30:08.283 --> 00:30:11.188
and that should be
every single one of us --

00:30:11.212 --> 00:30:14.149
please, invite them to join Countdown.

00:30:14.173 --> 00:30:16.125
CA: There's one more card up our sleeve.

00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:20.698
We're excited to unveil
a global media campaign.

00:30:20.722 --> 00:30:22.761
This is a campaign with a difference.

00:30:22.785 --> 00:30:24.912
Just as TEDx exploded

00:30:24.936 --> 00:30:28.460
by being allowed to grow
as a grassroots phenomenon,

00:30:28.484 --> 00:30:33.685
this campaign is designed
to be co-opted everywhere on the planet.

00:30:34.421 --> 00:30:37.198
If you happen to own a billboard company,

00:30:37.222 --> 00:30:39.284
or a TV station, or a radio station,

00:30:39.308 --> 00:30:40.768
or a website,

00:30:40.792 --> 00:30:43.942
or a social media account,

00:30:43.966 --> 00:30:47.253
we invite all of you to take the images
you're about to see

00:30:47.277 --> 00:30:49.991
and to just spread them far and wide.

00:30:50.015 --> 00:30:52.285
Our website will make this easy.

00:30:52.309 --> 00:30:54.896
We actually plan to translate them
into many languages,

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:59.825
courtesy of our volunteer army
of more than 20,000 translators worldwide.

00:30:59.849 --> 00:31:01.293
Some of them are with us here.

00:31:01.317 --> 00:31:04.250
If you're a TED translator,
would you wave, please?

00:31:05.539 --> 00:31:06.701
CF: There we go.

00:31:06.725 --> 00:31:08.863
(Applause)

00:31:08.887 --> 00:31:12.053
CA: Your work carries powerful ideas
to every corner of the earth.

00:31:12.077 --> 00:31:14.315
We're so proud of you, so grateful to you.

00:31:14.339 --> 00:31:17.688
So this campaign's designed
to grab attention

00:31:17.712 --> 00:31:20.847
and to communicate, yes, urgency

00:31:20.871 --> 00:31:23.141
but also a little smidgen of hope.

00:31:23.165 --> 00:31:27.688
We think it might be that combination
is what is needed to really drive action.

00:31:27.712 --> 00:31:31.768
We'd love you to let us know
what you think of these.

00:31:31.792 --> 00:31:32.947
CF: Right now.

00:31:32.971 --> 00:31:34.293
[Choose your future.]

00:31:34.317 --> 00:31:37.500
(Applause)

00:31:37.524 --> 00:31:39.537
[Turn fear into action
Join the countdown.]

00:31:39.561 --> 00:31:42.728
(Applause)

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:44.299
[Action inspires action

00:31:44.323 --> 00:31:46.577
Join the countdown.
The Earth will thank you.]

00:31:46.601 --> 00:31:47.752
(Applause)

00:31:47.752 --> 00:31:50.331
[10.10.2020 
Climate's Day of Destiny. You're invited.]

00:31:50.331 --> 00:31:51.720
CF: Remember the date.

00:31:51.744 --> 00:31:54.110
[Mass destruction. No biggie.
(If we prevent it.)]

00:31:54.134 --> 00:31:55.728
(Applause)

00:31:55.752 --> 00:31:59.021
[Giant asteroid heading our way
The common enemy that can unite us.]

00:31:59.045 --> 00:32:01.674
(Applause)

00:32:02.099 --> 00:32:04.695
[We love natural disasters
anyway -- said no one ever.

00:32:04.719 --> 00:32:06.180
So why are we causing them?]

00:32:06.204 --> 00:32:07.711
(Applause)

00:32:08.292 --> 00:32:10.799
[Relax, there's nothing
you can do about the climate

00:32:10.823 --> 00:32:13.201
Unless you work for a company.
Or live in a city.

00:32:13.205 --> 00:32:14.601
Or own a phone. Or a brain.]

00:32:14.625 --> 00:32:16.982
[Cause of death: Apathy.
But there's an antidote.]

00:32:17.006 --> 00:32:19.544
(Applause)

00:32:19.568 --> 00:32:20.983
[Stop f*cking everything up

00:32:21.007 --> 00:32:23.365
Inaction on climate is obscene.
We can fix this.]

00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:24.556
CA: Too much?

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.549
CF: No, not too much, yay, go for it.

00:32:26.573 --> 00:32:27.754
(Applause)

00:32:27.778 --> 00:32:29.500
[Have you gotten any action lately?

00:32:29.524 --> 00:32:31.991
Here's your chance.
Help turn the tide on climate.]

00:32:32.015 --> 00:32:33.197
(Laughter)

00:32:33.221 --> 00:32:35.715
CA: I didn't like this one,
but my team, you know --

00:32:35.739 --> 00:32:38.017
CF: Apparently, there are many
who do like it.

00:32:38.041 --> 00:32:40.334
(Laughter)

00:32:40.358 --> 00:32:41.771
[We give up. Sincerely, TED.

00:32:41.795 --> 00:32:44.514
Spreading ideas isn't enough.
It's time to act. Join us?]

00:32:44.538 --> 00:32:46.800
CA: This is, unfortunately,
truer than you know.

00:32:46.824 --> 00:32:49.070
[Some things matter more
than partisan politics

00:32:49.094 --> 00:32:51.087
Come fight the enemy that can unite us.]

We can avoid climate catastrophe
if we take urgent action now.]

00:33:03.635 --> 00:33:04.786
CA: That's it.

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:07.852
(Applause and cheers)

00:33:07.876 --> 00:33:09.359
CF: To bring this full circle,

00:33:09.383 --> 00:33:12.519
we would like to bring
someone very special in.

00:33:12.543 --> 00:33:14.209
(Video) Hi, I'm Claire O'Neill.

00:33:14.233 --> 00:33:18.712
I am the COP president-designate
for next year's Conference of the Parties,

00:33:18.736 --> 00:33:21.633
the annual UN climate change talks,
which will be in the UK,

00:33:21.657 --> 00:33:23.958
and we're looking forward
to welcoming you there.

00:33:23.982 --> 00:33:26.768
But right now, I'm in Spain, in Madrid,

00:33:26.792 --> 00:33:29.410
at COP25, this annual event

00:33:29.434 --> 00:33:32.688
where we send negotiators and activists
from all over the world

00:33:32.712 --> 00:33:35.387
to see what we can do
to reduce CO2 emissions.

00:33:35.411 --> 00:33:38.545
But the problem is this:
emissions are going up, not down.

00:33:38.569 --> 00:33:41.609
And what I'm feeling is that 2020
is the year of action,

00:33:41.633 --> 00:33:43.443
the year where we have to stop talking

00:33:43.467 --> 00:33:44.815
and we have to start acting.

00:33:44.815 --> 00:33:47.014
And not just here,
in these conference centers,

00:33:47.014 --> 00:33:48.165
but everybody.

00:33:48.189 --> 00:33:50.740
And so the value of the TED process,

00:33:50.764 --> 00:33:52.791
the value of what we're all doing together

00:33:52.815 --> 00:33:54.950
is that we're spreading out
the conversations

00:33:54.974 --> 00:33:58.268
and the solutions from inside this space

00:33:58.292 --> 00:33:59.688
out to everybody.

00:33:59.712 --> 00:34:02.529
And I'm really looking forward
to working with the TED group

00:34:02.553 --> 00:34:03.744
over the next year.

00:34:03.768 --> 00:34:06.824
2020, for me, will be the most
important year for climate action,

00:34:06.848 --> 00:34:09.602
and we're all going
to deliver this together.

00:34:09.626 --> 00:34:12.277
(Applause)

00:34:12.301 --> 00:34:14.248
CF: OK, friends, so we're nearly there

00:34:14.272 --> 00:34:17.688
but just a few more very special snippets.

00:34:17.712 --> 00:34:22.140
First, a word from one
of the many great minds

00:34:22.164 --> 00:34:25.125
who will be accompanying us
on this journey.

00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:29.688
A message from the great author,
historian and futurist

00:34:29.712 --> 00:34:30.862
Yuval Harari.

00:34:31.927 --> 00:34:34.721
Yuval Harari: Climate change 
is about inequality.

00:34:34.745 --> 00:34:38.768
Inequality between the rich,
who are mainly responsible for it,

00:34:38.792 --> 00:34:41.392
and the poor, who will suffer the most.

00:34:41.792 --> 00:34:44.562
Inequality between us, Homo sapiens,

00:34:44.586 --> 00:34:46.180
who control this planet,

00:34:46.204 --> 00:34:49.622
and the other animals,
who are our helpless victims.

00:34:50.355 --> 00:34:52.760
Inequality between the scientists,

00:34:52.784 --> 00:34:55.776
who painstakingly search for the truth,

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.815
and the professional deceivers,

00:34:57.839 --> 00:35:00.805
who spread falsehoods
at the click of a button.

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:04.776
Climate change is about making a choice.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.831
What kind of planet do we want to inhabit,

00:35:07.855 --> 00:35:10.588
and what kind of humans do we want to be?

00:35:11.371 --> 00:35:14.679
A choice between greed and compassion,

00:35:14.703 --> 00:35:17.774
between carelessness and responsibility,

00:35:17.798 --> 00:35:20.814
between closing our eyes to the truth

00:35:20.838 --> 00:35:23.742
and opening our hearts to the world.

00:35:24.696 --> 00:35:26.807
Climate change is a crisis,

00:35:26.831 --> 00:35:31.299
but for humans, a crisis is always
also an opportunity.

00:35:31.744 --> 00:35:35.228
If we make the right choices
in the coming years,

00:35:35.252 --> 00:35:38.188
we cannot only save the ecosystem,

00:35:38.212 --> 00:35:41.760
but we can also create a more just world

00:35:41.784 --> 00:35:44.226
and make ourselves better people.

00:35:46.228 --> 00:35:53.022
(Applause)

00:35:53.046 --> 00:35:56.300
CF: So isn't that a powerful framing
of what we have ahead of us,

00:35:56.324 --> 00:35:59.806
and honestly, I think it is tragic

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:03.545
that the power of transformation
that we have ahead of us

00:36:03.569 --> 00:36:08.136
is so severely diminished by those
who would want to politicize the issue

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.525
and separate it into partisan politics.

00:36:11.549 --> 00:36:14.168
It cannot be a partisan issue,

00:36:14.192 --> 00:36:16.392
it cannot be a politicized issue.

00:36:16.768 --> 00:36:19.561
Happily, there are some
who are working against that.

00:36:19.585 --> 00:36:22.434
Today, we have one of those people,

00:36:22.458 --> 00:36:25.768
a fantastically courageous
climate scientist,

00:36:25.792 --> 00:36:27.728
who is a committed Christian,

00:36:27.752 --> 00:36:29.594
and who has been working on this issue

00:36:29.618 --> 00:36:33.944
with conservatives and with the religious
and spiritual communities for years,

00:36:33.968 --> 00:36:36.142
with incredible courage.

00:36:36.572 --> 00:36:37.722
Katharine Hayhoe.

00:36:38.437 --> 00:36:40.524
(Applause)

00:36:40.548 --> 00:36:43.790
Katherine Hayhoe: When someone
says climate change, we often think,

00:36:43.814 --> 00:36:45.764
"Oh, that's just an environmental issue.

00:36:45.788 --> 00:36:48.431
People who are tree huggers
or scientists care about it,

00:36:48.455 --> 00:36:51.897
or maybe people who are on the left
hand-side of the political spectrum."

00:36:51.921 --> 00:36:54.084
But the reality is,
whether we know it or not,

00:36:54.108 --> 00:36:57.347
we already care about climate change,
no matter who we are.

00:36:57.371 --> 00:36:58.539
Why?

00:36:58.563 --> 00:37:02.117
Because climate change affects
everything we already care about today.

00:37:02.141 --> 00:37:03.553
It affects our health,

00:37:03.577 --> 00:37:05.307
it affects the food we eat,

00:37:05.331 --> 00:37:08.077
the water we drink,
the air that we breathe.

00:37:08.101 --> 00:37:11.403
Climate change affects the economy
and national security.

00:37:11.427 --> 00:37:15.339
I care about a changing climate
because it is, as the military calls it,

00:37:15.363 --> 00:37:16.902
a threat multiplier.

00:37:17.331 --> 00:37:19.926
It takes issues like poverty and hunger,

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:22.403
disease, lack of access to clean water,

00:37:22.427 --> 00:37:24.260
even political instability,

00:37:24.284 --> 00:37:26.550
and exacerbates or amplifies them.

00:37:27.069 --> 00:37:29.172
That's why, to care
about a changing climate,

00:37:29.196 --> 00:37:31.307
we don't have to be
a certain type of person.

00:37:31.331 --> 00:37:33.633
A thermometer isn't blue or red,

00:37:33.657 --> 00:37:35.229
liberal or conservative --

00:37:35.253 --> 00:37:38.156
it gives us the same number
no matter how we vote.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:41.577
And we are all affected
by the impacts of a changing climate.

00:37:41.601 --> 00:37:43.410
So to care about a changing climate,

00:37:43.434 --> 00:37:45.196
all we have to be is one thing:

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:47.276
a human, living on planet Earth.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.958
And we're all that.

00:37:49.831 --> 00:37:52.807
(Applause)

00:37:52.831 --> 00:37:53.982
CF: And finally,

00:37:54.006 --> 00:37:58.720
the man who brought this issue
so powerfully to everyone's attention

00:37:58.744 --> 00:38:00.228
years ago

00:38:00.252 --> 00:38:05.367
and has continued tirelessly
to work on that issue ever since.

00:38:05.391 --> 00:38:08.516
The one and very only, Al Gore.

00:38:08.907 --> 00:38:12.278
(Applause)

00:38:12.302 --> 00:38:13.608
(Video) Al Gore: Thank you.

00:38:13.632 --> 00:38:14.955
(Applause)

00:38:14.979 --> 00:38:16.434
Thank you so much, Christiana,

00:38:16.458 --> 00:38:19.163
and thank you for
your outstanding leadership,

00:38:19.187 --> 00:38:23.042
and thank you, Chris Anderson
and the entire TED community,

00:38:23.066 --> 00:38:26.669
YouTube and all of the others
who are joining

00:38:26.693 --> 00:38:28.843
in this fantastic initiative.

00:38:29.479 --> 00:38:31.244
I have just three messages.

00:38:31.268 --> 00:38:34.883
Number one, this crisis
is incredibly urgent.

00:38:35.495 --> 00:38:38.819
Just yesterday, the scientists
gave us the report

00:38:38.843 --> 00:38:41.573
that emissions are still going up.

00:38:41.597 --> 00:38:42.883
Every single day,

00:38:42.907 --> 00:38:48.765
we're putting 150 million tons
of man-made global warming pollution

00:38:48.789 --> 00:38:52.281
into the thin shell of atmosphere
surrounding our planet.

00:38:52.305 --> 00:38:56.688
The accumulated amount now
traps as much extra energy every day

00:38:56.712 --> 00:39:01.928
as would be released by 500,000
first-generation atomic bombs

00:39:01.952 --> 00:39:04.217
exploding every single day.

00:39:04.543 --> 00:39:07.805
And the consequences
are increasingly clear --

00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:10.752
all that mother nature is telling us,

00:39:10.776 --> 00:39:12.569
the fires, and the sea-level rise,

00:39:12.593 --> 00:39:14.696
and the floods, and the mud slides,

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.672
and the loss of living species.

00:39:16.696 --> 00:39:21.535
But the second message that I have
is the hope is very real.

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:25.615
We actually do have
the solutions available to us.

00:39:25.639 --> 00:39:28.656
It is unfortunately true at this moment,

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:34.536
that the crisis is getting worse faster
than we are mobilizing these solutions.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.656
But renewable energy and electric vehicles

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.958
and batteries
and regenerative agriculture,

00:39:38.982 --> 00:39:40.768
circular manufacturing,

00:39:40.792 --> 00:39:44.749
and all of these other solutions
are gaining momentum.

00:39:45.162 --> 00:39:46.908
The late economist Rudi Dornbusch,

00:39:46.932 --> 00:39:50.702
in articulating what's known
as Dornbusch's law, said,

00:39:50.726 --> 00:39:54.210
"Things take longer to happen
than you think they will.

00:39:54.234 --> 00:39:57.490
But then, they happen much faster
than you thought they could."

00:39:57.919 --> 00:40:00.316
We can pick up the pace.

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.086
We are gaining momentum

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:04.895
and soon, we will be gaining
on the crisis.

00:40:04.919 --> 00:40:07.936
But it is essential that everyone join --

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.149
of every political persuasion,

00:40:10.173 --> 00:40:12.387
every ideological persuasion,

00:40:12.411 --> 00:40:13.654
every nationality,

00:40:13.678 --> 00:40:18.403
every division has to be obliterated,
so that we, humanity,

00:40:18.427 --> 00:40:20.442
can join together.

00:40:20.466 --> 00:40:24.601
And in closing, I would just say
that for anyone who doubts

00:40:24.625 --> 00:40:27.372
that we as human beings

00:40:27.396 --> 00:40:31.173
have the ability to rise to this occasion,

00:40:31.197 --> 00:40:33.299
when everything is on the line,

00:40:33.323 --> 00:40:37.982
just remember that political will
is itself a renewable resource.

00:40:38.885 --> 00:40:39.886
(Laughter)

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:46.910
(Applause)

00:40:50.554 --> 00:40:51.752
CA: Thank you so much.

00:40:51.776 --> 00:40:54.418
Thank you so much, Al,
for your leadership on this issue

00:40:54.442 --> 00:40:55.642
for so many years.

00:40:56.617 --> 00:40:58.409
None of this would be possible

00:40:58.433 --> 00:41:02.156
without an extraordinary
and fast-growing list of partners.

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.047
I'd like to acknowledge them.

00:41:04.791 --> 00:41:08.888
(Applause)

00:41:08.912 --> 00:41:10.110
If you're watching this,

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:12.825
you believe your organization
should be part of this,

00:41:12.849 --> 00:41:14.539
you can help in some way,

00:41:14.563 --> 00:41:17.015
join us, email me, chris@ted.com.

00:41:17.434 --> 00:41:19.505
This is going to take everyone.

00:41:19.887 --> 00:41:21.807
OK, before the Q and A,

00:41:21.831 --> 00:41:25.164
I just want to ask you a question
personally, Christiana.

00:41:25.188 --> 00:41:27.082
Like, what do you really think?

00:41:27.554 --> 00:41:28.577
(Laughter)

00:41:28.601 --> 00:41:31.545
No, you've been in so many of these.

00:41:31.569 --> 00:41:33.903
Does this initiative have a chance?

00:41:35.394 --> 00:41:38.037
CF: Well, first of all,

00:41:38.061 --> 00:41:41.584
we are at the point
where everything plays.

00:41:41.608 --> 00:41:43.410
Everything plays.

00:41:43.434 --> 00:41:46.045
And I'm really excited about this,

00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:51.727
because it has been very painful to me
to see how over the past 12 to 18 months

00:41:51.751 --> 00:41:55.100
because of the tragically
insufficient response

00:41:55.124 --> 00:41:56.879
that we have had to climate change,

00:41:56.903 --> 00:42:00.188
how that zeitgeist has been changing
from where we were in Paris,

00:42:00.212 --> 00:42:02.498
which was pretty positive and optimistic,

00:42:02.522 --> 00:42:06.070
to, now, despair, helplessness, anger.

00:42:06.602 --> 00:42:08.896
That's what is out there,
roaming on the streets.

00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.397
And I don't blame them,
and I have the same feelings.

00:42:11.421 --> 00:42:12.657
But the point is,

00:42:12.681 --> 00:42:17.376
we have to be able to transform that
into making the difference.

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:22.368
And I think this is what this initiative
is actually potentially ready to do,

00:42:22.392 --> 00:42:26.672
which is to give every single person
who feels helpless --

00:42:26.696 --> 00:42:29.482
give them a tool to do something.

00:42:29.506 --> 00:42:31.808
Some will contribute small efforts,

00:42:31.832 --> 00:42:33.614
some will contribute large efforts --

00:42:33.638 --> 00:42:37.084
depends on what your influence area is.

00:42:37.108 --> 00:42:42.514
And to those who feel angry
and despairing,

00:42:42.538 --> 00:42:47.347
well, give them also an opportunity
to channel that energy --

00:42:47.371 --> 00:42:49.197
which is very powerful energy --

00:42:49.221 --> 00:42:51.450
into solutions.

00:42:51.815 --> 00:42:54.855
And finally, what is very
exciting about this

00:42:54.879 --> 00:42:56.918
is the scale, Chris, right?

00:42:56.942 --> 00:43:00.783
I mean, just look at those partners
that are going to be there.

00:43:00.807 --> 00:43:04.175
We have attempted many, many things
to bring to scale.

00:43:04.199 --> 00:43:09.206
But this, I think, is the most promising
initiative that I have seen,

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:11.437
to be able to bring people to scale,

00:43:11.461 --> 00:43:13.855
to bring efforts and solutions to scale.

00:43:13.879 --> 00:43:15.553
And speed.

00:43:15.577 --> 00:43:20.474
Because if there's one thing
that we cannot, cannot fail on,

00:43:20.498 --> 00:43:21.998
is addressing climate change,

00:43:22.022 --> 00:43:23.180
but not only that,

00:43:23.204 --> 00:43:24.871
to do so in a timely way.

00:43:25.625 --> 00:43:27.815
CA: Thank you, that is eloquent.

00:43:27.839 --> 00:43:28.998
And thank you.

00:43:29.022 --> 00:43:30.175
That's it.

00:43:30.199 --> 00:43:37.199
(Applause)

00:43:37.561 --> 00:43:43.442
OK, we have many members
of the world's leading media here.

00:43:43.466 --> 00:43:44.911
We're going to have a Q and A,

00:43:44.935 --> 00:43:47.236
they should probably have
priority on questions.

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:50.275
If it all goes deathly silent,
someone else can ask a question.

00:43:50.299 --> 00:43:52.556
If you're a member of the media here,

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:56.114
please feel free to put your hand up --
we'll throw a mic to you,

00:43:56.138 --> 00:43:58.072
and we'll do the best we can.

00:43:59.022 --> 00:44:01.053
Rachel Crane: Hi, Rachel Crane from CNN.

00:44:01.363 --> 00:44:04.379
My question for you
is about more specific action

00:44:04.403 --> 00:44:05.966
that will come out of Countdown.

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:07.141
We heard a lot today

00:44:07.165 --> 00:44:09.657
about how this is mobilizing
the globe on this issue,

00:44:09.681 --> 00:44:12.775
breaking people out of their silos,
companies out of their silos,

00:44:12.799 --> 00:44:15.070
but I'm curious to know,
paint a picture for us,

00:44:15.094 --> 00:44:18.419
of what the action
that will come out of this initiative

00:44:18.443 --> 00:44:19.785
could potentially look like.

00:44:19.809 --> 00:44:21.594
I'm sure it's all in early phases,

00:44:21.618 --> 00:44:23.689
we won't hold you specifically to this.

00:44:23.713 --> 00:44:27.830
CA: There's an intense process
going on between now and October,

00:44:27.854 --> 00:44:29.227
where we're trying to engage

00:44:29.251 --> 00:44:32.727
all of the world's best
thinking on climate

00:44:32.751 --> 00:44:34.640
around those five big areas.

00:44:34.664 --> 00:44:38.057
What we're hoping to have there
is multiple proposals in there

00:44:38.081 --> 00:44:42.725
that collectively take a huge bite
out of those issues.

00:44:42.749 --> 00:44:46.424
Some of them, there may be
one big one that dominates.

00:44:46.448 --> 00:44:48.606
You know, so transport, for example.

00:44:49.455 --> 00:44:51.607
Could we accelerate the end

00:44:51.631 --> 00:44:53.723
of the internal
combustion engine, somehow?

00:44:53.747 --> 00:44:54.932
What would that take?

00:44:54.956 --> 00:44:57.603
That would be a classic problem
made for this approach,

00:44:57.627 --> 00:45:00.524
because what governments decide right now

00:45:00.548 --> 00:45:03.869
depends on what they see
happening elsewhere.

00:45:04.259 --> 00:45:06.727
Would the decisions
of auto executives be shifted

00:45:06.751 --> 00:45:09.588
if they saw millions of people
on social media saying,

00:45:09.612 --> 00:45:11.639
"I will never buy a combustion engine"?

00:45:11.663 --> 00:45:15.361
Would they be shifted by the market signal
of a few hundred mayors, saying,

00:45:15.385 --> 00:45:19.488
"We are creating
a carbon-zero zone in our city,

00:45:19.512 --> 00:45:21.306
and we're going to expand it,

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:22.641
and we're doing that soon"?

00:45:22.665 --> 00:45:26.657
Would they be shifted by a visionary
auto CEO taking the risk

00:45:26.657 --> 00:45:28.094
and coming forward and saying,

00:45:28.094 --> 00:45:31.115
"You know when we said
we were going to continue this till 2050?

00:45:31.139 --> 00:45:33.003
No. We can see the writing on the wall,

00:45:33.027 --> 00:45:35.075
we want to be on
the right side of history,

00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:36.352
we're doing this in 2030."

00:45:36.376 --> 00:45:38.423
We think there might be a pathway to that.

00:45:38.447 --> 00:45:39.783
So on some of these issues,

00:45:39.807 --> 00:45:44.847
it's going to depend on a massive amount
of discussion, bringing people together,

00:45:44.871 --> 00:45:48.396
showing -- this is what
you're so masterful at --

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.918
is showing that other people
don't have the attitudes

00:45:50.942 --> 00:45:52.244
that you think they have.

00:45:52.268 --> 00:45:54.323
They're actually shifting,
you better shift.

00:45:54.347 --> 00:45:58.474
And so it's mutually raising
everyone's ambition level.

00:45:58.863 --> 00:46:01.315
And that is a cycle that happens,

00:46:01.339 --> 00:46:03.125
and we've already seen it happening.

00:46:03.149 --> 00:46:06.141
And so, on each of these issues,
that's what we're looking for.

00:46:06.165 --> 00:46:07.783
The biggest, boldest things.

00:46:07.807 --> 00:46:09.696
Dream bigger than we normally do,

00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:13.402
because there are more people at the table
than there normally are,

00:46:13.426 --> 00:46:16.506
i.e. millions of citizens engaged in this.

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:19.117
That's the process,
and while that is happening,

00:46:19.141 --> 00:46:23.061
there'll be multiple other engagements
in companies and cities around the world.

00:46:23.085 --> 00:46:27.109
We hope that it all comes together
in a thrilling manner in October

00:46:27.133 --> 00:46:28.812
and we have something to celebrate.

00:46:28.836 --> 00:46:31.273
Dominique Drakeford:
My name is Dominique Drakeford

00:46:31.297 --> 00:46:35.267
with MelaninASS, or social media
as a form of media.

00:46:36.836 --> 00:46:39.823
In understanding the inherent correlation

00:46:39.847 --> 00:46:45.085
between the accumulation
of carbon in the atmosphere

00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:47.675
and the cumulative exploitation

00:46:47.699 --> 00:46:52.458
and extraction, extractivism economy,

00:46:52.482 --> 00:46:56.736
which creates sacrifice zones
for black and indigenous communities,

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:59.029
how do we plan to,

00:46:59.053 --> 00:47:04.609
or how do you guys plan to mitigate
those systems of oppression

00:47:04.633 --> 00:47:09.710
as part of your strategies
within those five various components,

00:47:09.734 --> 00:47:13.131
so that we can really
begin to reduce emissions?

00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:16.586
CF: If the transformation
in our economy and our society

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:22.251
does not include inequality closing
and social justice issues,

00:47:22.275 --> 00:47:24.091
then we're doing nothing.

00:47:24.115 --> 00:47:26.663
Because all of those things
will come back to bite us.

00:47:26.687 --> 00:47:30.251
So we have to put our arms
around the entire package.

00:47:30.275 --> 00:47:32.537
That is not easy,
but it is entirely possible.

00:47:32.561 --> 00:47:35.926
And that's one of the things
that I am so excited about climate change,

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:40.029
because it is at the front
of this transformation,

00:47:40.053 --> 00:47:43.855
but it will bring many of the other issues

00:47:43.879 --> 00:47:49.947
that have been relegated to nonattention.

00:47:49.971 --> 00:47:52.249
It will bring those issues
to the fore as well.

00:47:52.273 --> 00:47:56.670
So the transformation
has to be an integrative transformation.

00:47:56.694 --> 00:47:58.617
Ellen Maloney: Hi, Chris, hi, Christina.

00:47:58.641 --> 00:48:01.363
My question is, are individual efforts,

00:48:01.387 --> 00:48:05.688
like ditching plastic straws
or going vegan,

00:48:05.712 --> 00:48:06.966
making a difference

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:10.149
or are they just tokenistic
drops in the ocean?

00:48:10.173 --> 00:48:11.355
CF: Good question.

00:48:11.379 --> 00:48:12.807
CA: It's a good question.

00:48:12.831 --> 00:48:15.149
CF: They are totally important.

00:48:15.173 --> 00:48:16.697
Absolutely important.

00:48:16.721 --> 00:48:19.951
Because it's not just
about the one straw that I use.

00:48:19.975 --> 00:48:22.547
It's about me not using that straw,

00:48:22.571 --> 00:48:24.800
going to a restaurant
and telling the waitress,

00:48:24.824 --> 00:48:27.371
"Excuse me, I don't want
a plastic straw, because --"

00:48:27.395 --> 00:48:28.918
and giving her a little lesson,

00:48:28.942 --> 00:48:32.432
then she goes up to the manager,
the manager comes to the table and says,

00:48:32.456 --> 00:48:34.551
"Excuse me, could you explain that to me?"

00:48:34.575 --> 00:48:36.088
Then you go through the lesson.

00:48:36.112 --> 00:48:37.401
And sooner than you think,

00:48:37.425 --> 00:48:39.668
you have that restaurant,
plus the other ones.

00:48:39.692 --> 00:48:42.266
Actually, information is contagious.

00:48:42.736 --> 00:48:46.395
And wanting to do the right thing
is also contagious.

00:48:46.419 --> 00:48:50.442
So don't look at it as just
simply, you know, "What is a straw?

00:48:50.466 --> 00:48:56.018
Am I using the straw
or am I not using plastic bags,

00:48:56.042 --> 00:49:02.900
I have my plant-based bags
to go shopping," etc., etc.

00:49:03.575 --> 00:49:05.220
All of that counts.

00:49:05.244 --> 00:49:06.956
It counts for you, first of all,

00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:12.054
because it is a personal reminder
of who you are and what you stand for,

00:49:12.078 --> 00:49:16.110
but it is also a very important tool

00:49:16.134 --> 00:49:18.403
to educate everyone around you.

00:49:18.721 --> 00:49:21.261
CA: Right, and I think
the core of our initiative is,

00:49:21.285 --> 00:49:23.432
all that stuff matters -- what you eat,

00:49:23.456 --> 00:49:25.861
how you transport yourself, etc.,
it matters a lot.

00:49:25.885 --> 00:49:29.817
But there is another piece of power
that individuals have

00:49:29.841 --> 00:49:33.291
that they don't think about
as much, perhaps,

00:49:33.315 --> 00:49:35.895
and that we think that they should,
we invite them to,

00:49:35.919 --> 00:49:38.061
which is what they can do as an employee

00:49:38.085 --> 00:49:40.101
and what they can do
as a member of a city.

00:49:40.125 --> 00:49:41.847
There's a coming together here,

00:49:41.871 --> 00:49:44.871
where by getting organized,
by connecting with others,

00:49:44.895 --> 00:49:48.543
we think there is a direct route
to changing decisions

00:49:48.567 --> 00:49:51.737
that will have an even bigger
impact on the problem.

00:49:51.761 --> 00:49:55.367
So it's yes, all of that,
but more as well.

00:49:55.391 --> 00:49:56.574
(Laughter)

00:49:56.598 --> 00:50:00.899
CF: There is an online [question],
from a classroom of children.

00:50:00.923 --> 00:50:02.552
CA: From a classroom of children?

00:50:02.576 --> 00:50:03.907
CF: "What can students do?"

00:50:03.931 --> 00:50:06.712
Yay, I love that question,
totally love that question.

00:50:06.736 --> 00:50:08.426
So first of all,

00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:10.584
Fridays, 11 o'clock, go strike.

00:50:11.668 --> 00:50:13.291
I mean, honestly, right?

00:50:13.315 --> 00:50:14.680
(Applause)

00:50:14.704 --> 00:50:16.061
Let's go, let's go.

00:50:16.085 --> 00:50:18.649
And that pressure has to be maintained.

00:50:18.673 --> 00:50:21.196
I'm totally delighted
that there's some people here

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:24.109
who've been here doing it for 52 weeks.

00:50:24.133 --> 00:50:25.888
The problem with this is, folks,

00:50:25.912 --> 00:50:28.626
this is not a sprint, it's a marathon.

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:32.856
So you better get ready
for many more 52 weeks, right?

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.411
And get more people involved,

00:50:34.435 --> 00:50:36.649
because this is not easy.

00:50:36.673 --> 00:50:38.553
If it were easy, we would have done it.

00:50:38.577 --> 00:50:40.903
This is going to be a long-term effort.

00:50:40.927 --> 00:50:43.561
But fantastic to be out there
in the streets,

00:50:43.585 --> 00:50:46.125
you are getting so much
more attention from the media,

00:50:46.149 --> 00:50:49.244
from us stupid adults
who have not done our job --

00:50:49.268 --> 00:50:50.418
it is fantastic.

00:50:50.442 --> 00:50:52.799
So, you know, get your voices out there.

00:50:52.823 --> 00:50:54.434
Also, in school,

00:50:54.458 --> 00:50:57.712
you can definitely go and improve --

00:50:57.736 --> 00:50:59.926
The question that you just asked to TED,

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:02.974
that's the question every student
should be asking their school:

00:51:02.998 --> 00:51:04.590
"Where's my energy coming from?"

00:51:04.614 --> 00:51:05.851
Let's get with it, right?

00:51:05.875 --> 00:51:07.277
Students in colleges --

00:51:07.301 --> 00:51:10.304
how is it possible that we still have
colleges and universities

00:51:10.328 --> 00:51:13.493
that are not 100 percent clean energy

00:51:13.517 --> 00:51:17.581
and that haven't shifted
their capital and their endowment

00:51:17.605 --> 00:51:19.629
over to low carbon?

00:51:19.653 --> 00:51:21.156
I mean, it's just incredible.

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:23.101
(Applause)

00:51:23.125 --> 00:51:27.363
And finally, the most important thing
that young people can do

00:51:27.387 --> 00:51:30.117
is ask your parents,

00:51:30.141 --> 00:51:32.882
"What the hell are you doing
about my future?"

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:36.480
Because here is an amazing thing.

00:51:37.241 --> 00:51:39.725
I have spoken in --
I was thinking how many --

00:51:39.749 --> 00:51:45.185
I've spoken to at least three if not four
CEOs from the oil and gas industry.

00:51:45.209 --> 00:51:49.543
I've spoken to three or four
major investors,

00:51:49.567 --> 00:51:51.670
heads of their investment firms,

00:51:51.694 --> 00:51:54.932
who come up to me, usually in private,

00:51:54.956 --> 00:52:00.655
and say, "Christiana, the reason
why I'm changing what I do in my business

00:52:00.679 --> 00:52:03.949
is because my daughter, or my son,

00:52:03.973 --> 00:52:09.298
asks me at night, 'What the hell
are you doing about my future?' "

00:52:10.209 --> 00:52:13.122
That is a very powerful question,

00:52:13.146 --> 00:52:16.066
and only young people
can ask that question.

00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:18.353
Use that tool --

00:52:18.377 --> 00:52:22.117
ask your parents what are they
doing about your future.

00:52:22.141 --> 00:52:23.674
Sorry about the h-word.

00:52:24.322 --> 00:52:31.083
(Applause)

00:52:31.107 --> 00:52:33.440
Jo Confino: Hi,
I'm Jo Confino, the HuffPost.

00:52:33.464 --> 00:52:35.583
Christiana, a question for you,

00:52:35.607 --> 00:52:38.794
which is one of the things
that didn't come out so much

00:52:38.818 --> 00:52:41.283
and this is about the spiritual traditions

00:52:41.307 --> 00:52:43.585
and the role they play,

00:52:43.609 --> 00:52:45.216
because what we're seeing

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:47.539
is that, actually,
old wisdom is coming out

00:52:47.563 --> 00:52:49.082
in terms of interdependence

00:52:49.106 --> 00:52:51.119
and nothing is separate
from anything else.

00:52:51.143 --> 00:52:53.651
What is the spiritual tradition
we can bring to this

00:52:53.675 --> 00:52:55.393
that will make, also, a difference?

00:52:55.417 --> 00:52:58.731
CF: What I think is very powerful
about understanding,

00:52:58.755 --> 00:53:02.291
whether you happen to be
a spiritual person

00:53:02.315 --> 00:53:06.107
that pursues meditation and mindfulness

00:53:06.131 --> 00:53:08.670
or whether you're a religious
person or not,

00:53:08.694 --> 00:53:10.773
what I think is very powerful

00:53:10.797 --> 00:53:15.712
about the spiritual understanding
of the human presence on this earth,

00:53:15.736 --> 00:53:20.021
is to understand that we are not separate.

00:53:20.371 --> 00:53:23.481
It's not like,
"Over there is planet Earth,

00:53:23.505 --> 00:53:25.672
and then humans are over here."

00:53:25.696 --> 00:53:28.606
And we are totally interconnected
with all other species

00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:30.387
and with all other living beings,

00:53:30.411 --> 00:53:34.077
and doing the responsible thing by them,

00:53:34.101 --> 00:53:36.172
does the responsible thing by us.

00:53:36.196 --> 00:53:37.522
And vice versa.

00:53:37.546 --> 00:53:39.363
And so that interconnectedness

00:53:39.387 --> 00:53:41.847
is one that comes
from the spiritual traditions,

00:53:41.871 --> 00:53:45.077
but you don't have to be religious
or spiritual to understand that.

00:53:45.101 --> 00:53:46.474
You know, the fact is,

00:53:46.498 --> 00:53:50.108
every single drop of water
that we drink comes from nature.

00:53:50.132 --> 00:53:52.545
Every single morsel of food that we eat

00:53:52.569 --> 00:53:53.720
comes from nature.

00:53:53.744 --> 00:53:56.109
And we've got to heal that connection.

00:53:56.133 --> 00:53:57.680
CA: We would welcome engagement.

00:53:57.704 --> 00:54:01.353
(Applause)

00:54:01.815 --> 00:54:04.926
Kaley Roshitsh: Hi, Kaley Roshitsh
from Women's Wear Daily.

00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:07.697
Obviously, the fashion industry
is responsible for a lot

00:54:07.721 --> 00:54:09.234
of the carbon output,

00:54:09.258 --> 00:54:13.099
so I wondered what is your perspective
on conscious consumption?

00:54:13.496 --> 00:54:18.003
CA: The key goal here is to align,
at the same time,

00:54:18.027 --> 00:54:20.266
to change opinion on what companies do,

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:22.528
what employees do, what consumers do.

00:54:22.988 --> 00:54:27.662
It's the shifts all happening
at the same time that can make change.

00:54:27.686 --> 00:54:29.869
Right now, someone else
is always the problem.

00:54:29.893 --> 00:54:32.027
"Our investors wouldn't allow
us to do that."

00:54:32.051 --> 00:54:35.624
"There is no market for this better,
more sustainable product."

00:54:35.965 --> 00:54:39.036
And so, all the pieces
need to happen at the same time.

00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:40.782
That's our hope.

00:54:40.806 --> 00:54:42.974
And so the lead on this is not us,

00:54:42.998 --> 00:54:46.386
it's employees and CEOs
and leadership teams

00:54:46.410 --> 00:54:48.807
working in that industry.

00:54:49.657 --> 00:54:52.218
Get together, make something happen.

00:54:52.242 --> 00:54:56.982
And ride the tide of the zeitgeist shift
that is happening --

00:54:57.006 --> 00:54:59.978
it's going to work out
from the business point of view as well.

00:55:00.002 --> 00:55:01.658
CF: Can I jump on that as well?

00:55:01.682 --> 00:55:05.293
Because for years, for centuries,

00:55:05.317 --> 00:55:10.341
we have been on a consumer
extract-and-consume mentality.

00:55:10.365 --> 00:55:12.268
They way we go about our life

00:55:12.292 --> 00:55:14.379
and the way that businesses are created

00:55:14.403 --> 00:55:18.077
is extract, use, discard,
extract, use, discard.

00:55:18.101 --> 00:55:21.351
That's a simplification, but honestly,
it's about as simple as that.

00:55:21.375 --> 00:55:25.978
And to understand that that linear
extraction to discard

00:55:26.002 --> 00:55:29.017
can no longer be the case,
that it needs to be circular now,

00:55:29.041 --> 00:55:32.564
we have to go into a circular economy

00:55:32.588 --> 00:55:35.480
that uses every single resource
that we extract --

00:55:35.504 --> 00:55:37.330
because we will continue to extract --

00:55:37.354 --> 00:55:40.453
that uses it not once
but two, three, four, five, 10 times,

00:55:40.477 --> 00:55:41.992
around and around in circles.

00:55:42.016 --> 00:55:43.387
That's a circular economy.

00:55:43.411 --> 00:55:45.490
And we have to get to that point,

00:55:45.514 --> 00:55:50.085
because frankly, we're running out
of resources to continue to extract.

00:55:50.109 --> 00:55:52.371
Jodi Xu Klein: Hi, my name
is Jodi Xu Klein.

00:55:52.395 --> 00:55:57.442
I'm with the South China Morning Post,
a Hong Kong publication here in the US.

00:55:57.466 --> 00:56:00.968
So, we've been reporting on trade war
for more than a year,

00:56:00.992 --> 00:56:03.599
and we're actually living in a world

00:56:03.623 --> 00:56:06.507
where countries are decoupling
from each other.

00:56:06.531 --> 00:56:11.865
How do you overcome that trend
and bring everyone together?

00:56:11.889 --> 00:56:13.087
CA: We don't know,

00:56:13.111 --> 00:56:14.833
these are really challenging issues.

00:56:14.857 --> 00:56:17.769
What we do know is that we have to bring
everyone to the table

00:56:17.793 --> 00:56:19.031
and have the discussion.

00:56:19.055 --> 00:56:20.714
There are so many people in China,

00:56:20.738 --> 00:56:22.127
including, on many occasions,

00:56:22.151 --> 00:56:25.547
the Chinese government has made bold steps

00:56:25.571 --> 00:56:27.452
to tackle this issue.

00:56:27.476 --> 00:56:31.061
There's a lot that the West can learn
from what's happening in China.

00:56:31.085 --> 00:56:32.236
CF: I would say,

00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:37.474
in a world in which we're seeing
a wave of nationalism and populism,

00:56:37.498 --> 00:56:41.337
the way we go at this
is actually to expand

00:56:41.361 --> 00:56:44.314
the breadth of engagement,

00:56:44.338 --> 00:56:49.136
so not to let the responsibility
of engaging on climate

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:51.542
be in national government hands only.

00:56:51.566 --> 00:56:53.218
Yes, they have an important role,

00:56:53.242 --> 00:56:55.798
but we can bring it down as well

00:56:55.822 --> 00:57:00.218
to a different level of engagement
which is every single human being.

00:57:00.242 --> 00:57:03.357
And once we understand
that we're all human beings

00:57:03.381 --> 00:57:05.151
and that we all have a common future,

00:57:05.175 --> 00:57:07.595
there's no such thing
as all of us being in a boat

00:57:07.619 --> 00:57:10.841
and only the one closest to the hole
in the boat are going to sink.

00:57:10.865 --> 00:57:12.016
No.

00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:14.111
Either we all sink
or we all float together.

00:57:14.135 --> 00:57:16.960
Justine Calma: My name is Justine Calma,
I'm with The Verge,

00:57:16.984 --> 00:57:18.593
thanks so much for this.

00:57:18.617 --> 00:57:24.252
My question is about TED and YouTube's
own carbon footprint.

00:57:24.276 --> 00:57:28.347
Streaming video eats up
a huge amount of energy,

00:57:28.371 --> 00:57:33.697
and I'm curious what TED and YouTube

00:57:33.721 --> 00:57:37.339
might be doing to reduce
their own greenhouse gas emissions

00:57:37.363 --> 00:57:39.289
connected to that.

00:57:40.323 --> 00:57:42.534
CA: I can't speak for YouTube, obviously.

00:57:42.868 --> 00:57:46.756
I will say that, to quote
a line from George Monbiot,

00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:49.137
all of us are hypocrites in this movement.

00:57:49.161 --> 00:57:51.074
If you've ever bought something

00:57:51.098 --> 00:57:54.611
or you're wearing clothes,
or you're eating food,

00:57:54.635 --> 00:57:57.008
you're a hypocrite,
you're creating emissions.

00:57:57.032 --> 00:57:58.746
It's part of life.

00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:02.814
And I think perfection is --

00:58:03.182 --> 00:58:04.926
There's a risk that perfection,

00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:08.752
that an overpursuit and focus on that

00:58:08.776 --> 00:58:11.852
and the judging that comes with it
can slow everyone down.

00:58:12.178 --> 00:58:15.686
We want this to be a coalition
of the willing who accept

00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:18.099
that they're not perfect
but are willing to act.

00:58:18.123 --> 00:58:22.321
Now, this whole process
has sparked a huge conversation in TED

00:58:22.345 --> 00:58:25.141
about how we act more responsibly,

00:58:25.165 --> 00:58:26.487
and that will continue.

00:58:26.511 --> 00:58:30.301
We're certainly not going to stop
streaming videos.

00:58:30.325 --> 00:58:31.968
At some point you have to do math,

00:58:31.992 --> 00:58:35.055
it's like that -- give to the planet
more than you take from it,

00:58:35.079 --> 00:58:39.150
I think is the golden rule
that I personally really believe in.

00:58:39.174 --> 00:58:43.666
And so if an idea, powered
by a little bit of electricity,

00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:45.808
can ignite in someone's brain,

00:58:45.832 --> 00:58:49.205
I would bet on the idea
over saving the electricity.

00:58:49.229 --> 00:58:50.855
But there's no perfection in this.

00:58:50.879 --> 00:58:53.521
And we definitely have a lot
that we need to improve on.

00:58:53.545 --> 00:58:54.918
Let's go here and then back.

00:58:54.942 --> 00:58:58.543
Lane Florsheim: Hi, I'm Lane Florsheim
from the Wall Street Journal Magazine

00:58:58.567 --> 00:59:00.773
and Chris, I really liked
what you were saying

00:59:00.797 --> 00:59:03.511
about the fashion industry
and what they can do to change

00:59:03.535 --> 00:59:06.118
and how it requires employees
and CEOs to meet together

00:59:06.142 --> 00:59:09.174
because who understands an industry
better than the people in it

00:59:09.198 --> 00:59:11.103
and their processes and infrastructure,

00:59:11.127 --> 00:59:14.625
but I'm wondering, what about companies
with huge footprints,

00:59:14.649 --> 00:59:18.474
and two that come to mind first
are Amazon and Zara,

00:59:18.498 --> 00:59:19.863
where, by all accounts,

00:59:19.887 --> 00:59:22.776
the workers, the employees there
don't have very much power

00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:27.156
and the CEOs don't have
very much incentive to change right now.

00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:30.283
What would you say
about those kinds of companies?

00:59:31.307 --> 00:59:34.702
CA: So this is going to be such
an important conversation going forward,

00:59:34.726 --> 00:59:36.982
because we're in the ironic position

00:59:37.006 --> 00:59:40.649
where the people who can do
the most to solve this problem

00:59:40.673 --> 00:59:43.419
are the people who are currently
the worst offenders.

00:59:43.443 --> 00:59:44.606
So what do we do?

00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:47.228
Do we make them part
of the conversation or not?

00:59:47.252 --> 00:59:49.315
I say we make them
part of the conversation,

00:59:49.339 --> 00:59:51.992
so long as we see serious engagement.

00:59:52.434 --> 00:59:53.585
So take Amazon.

00:59:53.609 --> 00:59:58.532
Jeff Bezos has actually listened
to what many of his employees have said --

00:59:58.556 --> 01:00:00.990
they've been very vigorous,
the employee base there,

01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:02.283
about carbon footprint --

01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:05.672
has listened, has engaged
with you and with others.

01:00:05.696 --> 01:00:09.851
And they have announced,
I think it's correct to say announced --

01:00:09.875 --> 01:00:11.041
CF: Yes, they have.

01:00:11.065 --> 01:00:13.713
CA: ... an acceleration
of their own commitment

01:00:13.737 --> 01:00:19.333
to go to, basically, a net zero track
by 2040, if I have it right.

01:00:19.357 --> 01:00:24.611
It's the companies with the thousands,
the tens of thousands of trucks

01:00:24.635 --> 01:00:26.611
and the packaging and all the rest of it.

01:00:26.635 --> 01:00:29.149
That is how this problem will get solved.

01:00:29.173 --> 01:00:34.601
So I say we invite these CEOs
to be part of this,

01:00:34.625 --> 01:00:37.903
and urge them to take it seriously

01:00:37.927 --> 01:00:42.061
and to go fast and maybe even faster
than they're completely comfortable doing.

01:00:42.085 --> 01:00:44.018
But that's, I think, what we have to do.

01:00:44.042 --> 01:00:48.194
Not to defame, denounce,

01:00:48.218 --> 01:00:51.931
before we've at least had
a serious conversation about,

01:00:51.955 --> 01:00:53.415
"It's time,

01:00:53.439 --> 01:00:54.939
your employees want to do this,

01:00:54.963 --> 01:00:56.617
your customers want to do this,

01:00:56.641 --> 01:01:00.402
your investors increasingly
want to do this, let's do this."

01:01:00.807 --> 01:01:01.958
That's our hope.

01:01:01.982 --> 01:01:04.958
CF: And the wonderful thing
about companies the size of Amazon,

01:01:04.982 --> 01:01:06.470
or Walmart when they did it,

01:01:06.494 --> 01:01:09.236
is that they have a huge
trickle-up effect.

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:11.299
Because when Jeff Bezos came out and said,

01:01:11.323 --> 01:01:14.200
"I'm going to make Amazon
climate-neutral by 2040 -- "

01:01:14.224 --> 01:01:15.474
Paris Agreement says 2050,

01:01:15.498 --> 01:01:18.004
of course he wants to do
everything better than that,

01:01:18.028 --> 01:01:19.585
so 2040 is for Amazon.

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:21.633
Well good, we're going to keep him to it.

01:01:21.657 --> 01:01:23.864
Now, the amazing thing about that

01:01:23.888 --> 01:01:28.022
is that in order for Amazon
to be climate-neutral by 2040,

01:01:28.046 --> 01:01:31.156
they have to work
with all their supply chain going up.

01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:33.466
They have to work
with all of those companies

01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:35.783
that deliver services and goods to them

01:01:35.807 --> 01:01:38.330
for them to also be climate neutral ASAP.

01:01:38.354 --> 01:01:41.014
Because otherwise, they can't meet
their own commitment.

01:01:41.038 --> 01:01:46.013
So large companies are actually
very, very key and instrumental to this,

01:01:46.037 --> 01:01:48.855
because it's not just
about their footprint,

01:01:48.879 --> 01:01:54.117
it's about the embedded footprint
that they inherit in their supply chain.

01:01:54.141 --> 01:01:57.236
And the transformation of that
is really huge.

01:01:57.888 --> 01:01:59.650
CA: Last question.

01:01:59.674 --> 01:02:02.163
Jackie Padilla: My name is Jackie
with NowThis News,

01:02:02.187 --> 01:02:04.628
and every day, I work
with young climate activists

01:02:04.652 --> 01:02:06.207
like the ones we've heard today,

01:02:06.231 --> 01:02:08.125
but when we do stories on them,

01:02:08.149 --> 01:02:09.839
you know, including Greta Thunberg,

01:02:09.863 --> 01:02:12.649
I see fierce criticism that they face

01:02:12.673 --> 01:02:14.997
and largely, it's because
of a generational gap.

01:02:15.395 --> 01:02:18.291
I don't know if you're familiar
with the phrase "OK Boomer,"

01:02:18.315 --> 01:02:23.365
but it seems like there's a lot
of guilt or accountability

01:02:23.389 --> 01:02:24.664
that some are looking for,

01:02:24.688 --> 01:02:27.403
and on the other end,
we're looking at a lack of education

01:02:27.427 --> 01:02:28.966
or just ignorance on the issue.

01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:33.534
So what is your advice to young people
to respond to that criticism

01:02:33.558 --> 01:02:36.400
to foster constructive conversations?

01:02:36.424 --> 01:02:38.487
CF: We should probably ask them.

01:02:38.511 --> 01:02:40.847
XB: Hi, thank you for your question.

01:02:40.871 --> 01:02:42.538
CA: Come here.

01:02:42.562 --> 01:02:44.521
(Applause)

01:02:46.506 --> 01:02:49.141
XB: It is true that we
increasingly face criticism,

01:02:49.165 --> 01:02:52.283
and it's not only when we speak to people,
with climate deniers

01:02:52.307 --> 01:02:53.458
or things like that,

01:02:53.482 --> 01:02:55.355
but also on social media.

01:02:55.379 --> 01:02:58.760
It is as much a tool to spread information

01:02:58.784 --> 01:03:00.090
and organize our strikes

01:03:00.114 --> 01:03:02.029
and get the information out there,

01:03:02.053 --> 01:03:05.172
but it's also a tool for people
who want to undermine us,

01:03:05.196 --> 01:03:07.569
to personally attack us.

01:03:07.593 --> 01:03:11.244
And the way in which we stay resilient

01:03:11.268 --> 01:03:14.990
is when we build community
with each other,

01:03:15.014 --> 01:03:16.363
when we organize,

01:03:16.387 --> 01:03:18.720
we mimic the world we want to see.

01:03:18.744 --> 01:03:21.371
There is no hierarchy in our organizing,

01:03:21.395 --> 01:03:25.133
we are all working towards
the same goal constructively,

01:03:25.157 --> 01:03:30.499
choosing our passions towards
making the strike the best it can be.

01:03:30.523 --> 01:03:34.206
We got 300,000 people
striking in New York,

01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:36.600
we put together a whole concert,

01:03:36.624 --> 01:03:39.131
people called it
"Climchella," it was great.

01:03:39.505 --> 01:03:41.298
(Laughter)

01:03:41.322 --> 01:03:45.219
But the point is that
it's not going to stop us.

01:03:45.243 --> 01:03:47.132
The criticism is not going to stop us.

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:49.815
And even though we know that we are kids,

01:03:49.839 --> 01:03:52.868
and we are not here to tell you
all the solutions

01:03:52.892 --> 01:03:55.807
that already are out there.

01:03:56.125 --> 01:03:58.488
We are going to do it,

01:03:58.512 --> 01:04:00.950
because every kid who cares
about the climate crisis

01:04:00.974 --> 01:04:05.625
is going to grow up to study
through an environmental lens

01:04:05.649 --> 01:04:08.386
and to change the world through that.

01:04:08.752 --> 01:04:12.206
So we are here to tell you,

01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:16.599
personally, climate activists that I know
don't use "OK Boomer,"

01:04:16.623 --> 01:04:21.336
because we strive
for intergenerational cooperation.

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:26.221
And I think that blaming
and dividing each other

01:04:26.245 --> 01:04:28.570
is not going to get us anywhere,

01:04:28.594 --> 01:04:30.205
which is why we don't use it,

01:04:30.229 --> 01:04:31.944
and I don't think it should be used,

01:04:31.968 --> 01:04:36.593
and I actually want to thank everybody
who is doing something,

01:04:36.617 --> 01:04:39.723
because action inspires action.

01:04:40.033 --> 01:04:42.661
And you inspire us,

01:04:42.685 --> 01:04:45.484
and we're glad
that we inspire you as well.

01:04:45.508 --> 01:04:52.267
(Cheers and applause)

01:04:52.291 --> 01:04:55.378
(Applause)

01:04:55.402 --> 01:04:56.553
CA: Wow.

01:04:56.577 --> 01:04:57.630
(Applause)

01:04:57.654 --> 01:04:59.164
CF: There you have it.

01:04:59.188 --> 01:05:02.751
(Applause and cheers)

01:05:02.775 --> 01:05:08.285
(Applause)

01:05:08.309 --> 01:05:13.190
CA: There is no better note
on which to end this.

01:05:13.214 --> 01:05:14.365
Thank you.

01:05:14.389 --> 01:05:21.088
(Applause)
