00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:17.559
These two Kenyan ladies were best friends

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:19.487
from neighboring villages,

00:00:19.511 --> 00:00:23.284
but they'd stopped seeing each other,
literally, for 10 years,

00:00:23.308 --> 00:00:27.033
because both had gone blind
from a curable condition called cataracts.

00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:30.857
They hadn't been aware they'd been
sat together for over an hour

00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:33.612
when we offered them surgery
at the nearest hospital.

00:00:33.636 --> 00:00:35.782
Mama Jane, on the right, told me

00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:39.043
her biggest fear was that
she would poison her grandson,

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:40.865
whom she'd never seen,

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:43.743
because she couldn't see
what she was cooking for him.

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:47.582
Her arms were covered in burns
from cooking on a charcoal stove,

00:00:47.606 --> 00:00:51.710
and she despaired that she was robbing
her six-year-old grandson of his childhood

00:00:51.734 --> 00:00:54.113
because he was effectively her eyes.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.058
The effect of her blindness
was going through the generations.

00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:02.595
He wasn't able to go to school
or break the cycle of poverty.

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:06.878
All of this, despite cost-effective
solutions existing.

00:01:06.902 --> 00:01:09.741
Cataract surgery can be done
in under 10 minutes

00:01:09.765 --> 00:01:11.558
for just a hundred dollars.

00:01:11.582 --> 00:01:15.064
Four in every five people
who are blind don't need to be;

00:01:15.088 --> 00:01:18.280
curative or preventive
treatments already exist.

00:01:19.108 --> 00:01:21.561
Fortunately for Mama Jane and her friend,

00:01:21.585 --> 00:01:23.412
a donor had provided treatment

00:01:23.436 --> 00:01:25.770
so that we could take them
to the nearest hospital

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:27.338
three hours away.

00:01:27.362 --> 00:01:29.176
But in that very same clinic,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.875
I met Theresa,

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.986
a shy young woman who couldn't
look me in the eyes,

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.891
not because she couldn't see,

00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:39.069
but the appearance of the growth
on her eyes called pterygium

00:01:39.093 --> 00:01:40.868
meant she'd lost her confidence,

00:01:40.892 --> 00:01:43.258
and with it, her place in her community.

00:01:43.282 --> 00:01:45.838
She had no prospects
for marriage or children

00:01:45.862 --> 00:01:47.895
and had been completely ostracized.

00:01:48.381 --> 00:01:51.523
I knew how to treat her condition;
it was pretty straightforward.

00:01:51.547 --> 00:01:54.292
But we had strict instructions
that the funds we had

00:01:54.316 --> 00:01:55.945
were for people with cataracts.

00:01:56.945 --> 00:01:58.841
What was I supposed to do?

00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:00.239
Ignore her?

00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:04.196
My wife and I managed to raise the funds
to cover her treatment,

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.052
but situations like Theresa
were common every day,

00:02:07.076 --> 00:02:09.579
where people had the wrong diseases.

00:02:10.068 --> 00:02:11.663
And by the "wrong diseases,"

00:02:11.687 --> 00:02:15.597
I mean conditions for which
funding hadn't been earmarked.

00:02:17.055 --> 00:02:21.449
Earmarking may seem like smart business
or smart philanthropy on paper,

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:24.955
but it doesn't make any sense
when you're looking the person in the eye.

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:29.805
Yet, this is how we deliver health care
to millions of people the world over.

00:02:31.513 --> 00:02:34.743
I've been thinking about this problem
for a very long time.

00:02:35.466 --> 00:02:39.815
Things happened to me at the age of 12
that completely transformed my life.

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:43.256
My teachers insisted
that I would go for an eye test.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.339
I resisted it for as many years as I could

00:02:45.363 --> 00:02:47.575
because as the only
brown boy in the school,

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.424
I already felt like
a chocolate chip in rice pudding,

00:02:50.448 --> 00:02:54.423
and the idea of looking more different
was not particularly appealing.

00:02:54.447 --> 00:02:57.110
You see, I'd associated
an eye test with wearing glasses

00:02:57.134 --> 00:02:58.507
and looking different,

00:02:58.531 --> 00:03:00.113
not with seeing differently.

00:03:00.708 --> 00:03:02.846
When eventually I was persuaded to go,

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.218
the optometrist fitted me
with the trial lenses

00:03:05.242 --> 00:03:07.990
and was shocked
at just how poor my sight was.

00:03:08.014 --> 00:03:10.642
He sent me outside
to report what I could see.

00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:15.474
I remember looking up and seeing
trees had leaves on them.

00:03:15.498 --> 00:03:17.179
I had never known this.

00:03:18.068 --> 00:03:22.098
Later that week, for the first time,
I saw stars in the night sky.

00:03:22.122 --> 00:03:23.561
It was breathtaking.

00:03:24.163 --> 00:03:27.500
In fact, the entire trajectory
of my life changed.

00:03:27.524 --> 00:03:31.089
I went from a failing child at school
who was constantly told I was lazy

00:03:31.113 --> 00:03:32.328
and not paying attention

00:03:32.352 --> 00:03:35.308
to suddenly being a child
with opportunity and potential.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.698
But I soon realized that
this opportunity was not universal.

00:03:39.722 --> 00:03:41.615
That same summer, in Egypt,

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.947
the home where my parents
are originally from,

00:03:43.971 --> 00:03:46.734
I was with children that looked
a lot more like me

00:03:46.758 --> 00:03:48.950
but couldn't have been more different.

00:03:48.974 --> 00:03:51.065
What separated us was opportunity.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.938
How is it that I had this life
and they had theirs?

00:03:54.962 --> 00:03:56.787
It still makes no sense to me.

00:03:57.306 --> 00:03:58.465
How is it we've --

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.200
in a world where glasses,
that completely changed my life

00:04:02.224 --> 00:04:04.533
have been around for 700 years,

00:04:04.557 --> 00:04:07.908
yet two and a half billion people
still can't access them.

00:04:08.503 --> 00:04:12.175
This deep sense of injustice
drove me to become a doctor,

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:13.876
eventually an eye surgeon,

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.431
and in 2012, my wife and I
packed our bags and moved to Kenya

00:04:18.455 --> 00:04:20.086
to try and give something back.

00:04:20.797 --> 00:04:23.082
We started by setting up
a hundred eye clinics

00:04:23.106 --> 00:04:24.553
across the Great Rift Valley,

00:04:24.577 --> 00:04:27.083
where we met people
like Mama Jane and Theresa.

00:04:27.855 --> 00:04:30.353
We founded a new organization
called Peek Vision,

00:04:30.377 --> 00:04:34.005
a social enterprise where
we built smartphone technology

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:36.626
that makes it possible
for people in the community

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.377
to find people in their homes,

00:04:38.401 --> 00:04:41.096
the most vulnerable groups
who are being missed,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.965
and created new tools that made it
easier to diagnose them

00:04:43.989 --> 00:04:45.838
and connect them to services.

00:04:45.862 --> 00:04:48.158
Inspired by the challenges
I'd had as a child,

00:04:48.182 --> 00:04:51.074
we equipped teachers,
25 of them, with smartphones

00:04:51.098 --> 00:04:52.965
to screen children in schools.

00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:55.387
Our first program resulted
in 21,000 children

00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:57.563
being screened in just nine days.

00:04:58.149 --> 00:05:01.569
That same program was replicated
to reach 200,000 children,

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:03.438
covering the entire district.

00:05:03.462 --> 00:05:06.031
Soon we were able to repeat this
in six new programs

00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:07.405
in different countries.

00:05:08.106 --> 00:05:12.024
But now, I was faced with the very
same problems I had with Theresa

00:05:12.048 --> 00:05:13.836
of earmarked funds,

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.659
but now as an organization.

00:05:16.374 --> 00:05:19.770
People wanted to fund specific projects

00:05:19.794 --> 00:05:21.549
or particular diseases

00:05:21.573 --> 00:05:23.512
or subsets of the population.

00:05:24.178 --> 00:05:25.773
But it didn't make sense,

00:05:25.797 --> 00:05:28.477
because what we needed to do
was build an incredible team

00:05:28.501 --> 00:05:31.214
who could create the systems
that would change the lives

00:05:31.238 --> 00:05:33.633
of millions of people,
whatever their needs were.

00:05:34.385 --> 00:05:35.880
But it didn't work that way.

00:05:38.166 --> 00:05:43.189
Soon, we were able to align ourselves
with partners who understood,

00:05:43.213 --> 00:05:45.270
because I understand the challenge.

00:05:45.294 --> 00:05:48.569
Ultimately, you need to trust
where your money's going,

00:05:48.593 --> 00:05:51.213
and that trust usually manifests
through the requirement

00:05:51.237 --> 00:05:53.688
to create detailed plans --
lots of paperwork.

00:05:53.712 --> 00:05:56.052
But what happens
if the dynamic needs of people

00:05:56.076 --> 00:05:58.118
don't fit with the plan that you created,

00:05:58.142 --> 00:06:01.071
and your funding is dependent
on delivering the plan?

00:06:01.095 --> 00:06:02.547
You end up with a choice:

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:05.563
Do you serve the plan, the funder,

00:06:05.587 --> 00:06:06.998
or do you serve the need?

00:06:07.482 --> 00:06:09.909
This is not a choice
we should have to make,

00:06:09.933 --> 00:06:12.994
because ultimately,
we can only serve one master.

00:06:14.633 --> 00:06:16.740
The measure of our humanity

00:06:16.764 --> 00:06:19.601
is how we serve the most
vulnerable amongst us.

00:06:20.033 --> 00:06:24.495
Currently, the system is not working,
and too many people are being left behind.

00:06:25.245 --> 00:06:28.718
We've been fortunate to find
incredible supporters and partners,

00:06:28.742 --> 00:06:31.512
which led to a new program in Botswana,

00:06:31.536 --> 00:06:34.878
in which every single schoolchild
is being screened and treated

00:06:34.902 --> 00:06:37.256
by the end of 2021,

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.344
meaning an entire generation of children

00:06:39.368 --> 00:06:41.849
will have the opportunity
that good vision affords.

00:06:42.423 --> 00:06:44.502
But this took years of work.

00:06:44.526 --> 00:06:46.620
It took multiple feasibility studies,

00:06:46.644 --> 00:06:49.238
engaging different
partners and stakeholders,

00:06:49.262 --> 00:06:51.524
business cases, economic analyses,

00:06:51.548 --> 00:06:54.341
to persuade the government
to eventually come on board.

00:06:54.365 --> 00:06:58.281
But they're now leading and funding this
in their own national budget.

00:06:58.305 --> 00:07:01.524
But we did not have
the resources to do this.

00:07:01.937 --> 00:07:05.317
Our visionary funders and partners
came alongside us,

00:07:05.341 --> 00:07:08.666
and the key ingredients were
we were aligned on mission,

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:10.319
on the why we were doing it.

00:07:11.071 --> 00:07:14.871
We agreed on the outcome,
what had to be done.

00:07:14.895 --> 00:07:18.932
But critically, they were flexible
and gave us autonomy

00:07:18.956 --> 00:07:21.204
to work out how we got there,

00:07:21.228 --> 00:07:25.204
giving us the space to be creative,
ambitious and take risk.

00:07:25.795 --> 00:07:28.159
What if all health care looked like this?

00:07:28.183 --> 00:07:32.279
What would it mean for all
the social causes we're trying to solve?

00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:34.838
Business knows this.

00:07:34.862 --> 00:07:37.441
By taking a long-term, ambitious view

00:07:37.465 --> 00:07:39.744
and giving people
the autonomy to be creative

00:07:39.768 --> 00:07:41.776
to solve our world's biggest challenges,

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.872
we've disrupted entire industries.

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:46.047
Look at Amazon, Google.

00:07:46.071 --> 00:07:48.202
Surely, we need the same level of ambition

00:07:48.226 --> 00:07:51.193
if we're going to serve the most
vulnerable in our societies.

00:07:51.574 --> 00:07:53.918
As a planet, we've set a target,

00:07:53.942 --> 00:07:56.338
the Sustainable Development Goals,

00:07:56.362 --> 00:08:00.493
yet we're spending less than half
the amount on tackling the global goals

00:08:00.517 --> 00:08:02.452
than we are on conflict resolution,

00:08:02.476 --> 00:08:06.172
which mostly arises from
the very inequalities we're not serving.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.569
It's time for change.

00:08:09.015 --> 00:08:12.747
It's not just common sense as well --
it makes business sense.

00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:14.532
Our work in Botswana showed

00:08:14.556 --> 00:08:18.476
for a modest investment, the economy
would gain 1.3 billion dollars

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.364
over the lifetime of the children.

00:08:20.388 --> 00:08:23.085
That was 150 times return on investment.

00:08:23.681 --> 00:08:27.230
But part of the problem is
that value is generated in the future,

00:08:27.254 --> 00:08:29.247
but we need the money now to deliver it.

00:08:30.424 --> 00:08:32.776
Turns out, this is not a new problem.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.032
Banks have been solving it for centuries.

00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:37.026
Simply put, it's called financing.

00:08:38.192 --> 00:08:39.528
If you want to buy a house

00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:41.918
but you can't afford
to pay for it up front,

00:08:41.942 --> 00:08:45.313
the bank financiers, you see,
can realize that future value now.

00:08:45.337 --> 00:08:48.345
In other words, you can live
in the house straightaway.

00:08:48.369 --> 00:08:49.624
But what if you couldn't?

00:08:49.648 --> 00:08:53.750
What if you had to wait until you'd raised
all of the money to move into the house,

00:08:53.774 --> 00:08:56.564
and you were kept homeless
whilst trying to save the money

00:08:56.588 --> 00:08:58.135
to get there in the first place?

00:08:58.159 --> 00:09:01.086
You'd end up in an impossible cycle,
never able to get there,

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.893
yet that's this very same bind
we've put on ourselves.

00:09:04.694 --> 00:09:06.667
Inspired by the change in Botswana

00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:09.645
and by the visionary support
of our funders and partners,

00:09:09.669 --> 00:09:12.541
we've come together --
two world-leading banks,

00:09:12.565 --> 00:09:15.932
for-profit and private,
not-for-profit organizations,

00:09:15.956 --> 00:09:17.830
foundations and philanthropists --

00:09:17.854 --> 00:09:20.273
to launch the Vision Catalyst Fund,

00:09:20.297 --> 00:09:23.034
a fund which will have trust
built in by design.

00:09:23.693 --> 00:09:26.240
It will make funding available now

00:09:26.264 --> 00:09:30.127
to the organizations that can serve
the need of the most vulnerable.

00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:34.066
It will ensure that those organizations
can work together in partnership,

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.526
rather than competing for limited funds,

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:39.353
serving the priority needs
of an entire population,

00:09:39.377 --> 00:09:40.909
whatever they are,

00:09:40.933 --> 00:09:43.452
so that ultimately
the individuals affected

00:09:43.476 --> 00:09:45.723
can receive the care that they deserve.

00:09:46.176 --> 00:09:47.878
And as we've shown,

00:09:47.902 --> 00:09:50.641
it doesn't make just a health
and social difference,

00:09:50.665 --> 00:09:53.046
it creates huge economic benefit.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.935
This benefit in itself
will create sustainability

00:09:55.959 --> 00:10:01.103
to perpetuate a virtuous,
catalytic cycle of improvement and change.

00:10:01.749 --> 00:10:03.619
Because when we do this,

00:10:03.643 --> 00:10:06.912
the individual needs of people
like myself can be met.

00:10:07.979 --> 00:10:12.138
And this coalition
has come together this year

00:10:12.162 --> 00:10:14.950
to make a commitment
with 53 heads of government,

00:10:14.974 --> 00:10:17.016
who have now committed to take action

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.928
towards achieving access
to quality eye care for all.

00:10:20.417 --> 00:10:22.186
We've had incredible commitments

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:25.007
of 200 million pairs
of glasses to the fund

00:10:25.031 --> 00:10:26.704
and millions of dollars,

00:10:27.807 --> 00:10:30.952
so that the dynamic
and individual needs of people --

00:10:30.976 --> 00:10:33.527
like my own issues that I had as child,

00:10:33.551 --> 00:10:36.533
and like Theresa, who just
required simple surgery --

00:10:36.557 --> 00:10:37.884
can be met.

00:10:38.475 --> 00:10:42.477
For Theresa, it meant
her place back in society,

00:10:42.501 --> 00:10:44.919
now with her own family and children.

00:10:45.506 --> 00:10:50.157
And for Mama Jane,
it wasn't just restoring her sight,

00:10:50.181 --> 00:10:53.185
it meant the opportunity to restore hope,

00:10:53.209 --> 00:10:54.978
to restore joy

00:10:55.002 --> 00:10:56.780
and to restore dignity.

00:10:57.457 --> 00:11:03.141
(Music)

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.429
Thank you.

00:11:10.453 --> 00:11:13.670
(Applause)
