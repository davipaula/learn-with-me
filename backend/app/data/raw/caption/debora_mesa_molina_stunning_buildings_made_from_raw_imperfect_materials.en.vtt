00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.000
Architecture is a profession
with many rules,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.440
some written, some not,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.280
some relevant and others not.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.040
As architects,
we're constantly gravitating

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.160
between following these rules by the book

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.560
or making a space for imagination --

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.880
for experimentation.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.440
This is a difficult balance.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.040
Especially through architecture,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.880
you're trying to challenge preconceptions
and push boundaries and innovate,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.680
even if just using what we have around
and we overlook all the time.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.160
And this is what I've been doing
along with my team,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.440
Ensamble Studio,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.560
and from our very early works

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.360
that happened
in strict historic contexts,

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.040
like the city of Santiago de Compostela.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.560
Here we built the General Society
of Authors and Editors,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.560
a cultural building.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.400
And on top of all the regulations,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.440
we had to use stone by code

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.520
and our experience was limited,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.880
but we had incredible
references to learn from,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.400
some coming from the city itself

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.040
or from nearby landscapes

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.600
or other remote places

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.360
that had impacted
our education as architects,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.960
and maybe you recognize here.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.560
But somehow the finished products
that industry made available

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.440
for us as architects
to use in our buildings

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.960
seemed to have lost their soul.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.120
And so we decided to go
to the nearby quarries

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.000
to better understand the process
that transforms a mountain

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.800
into a perfectly square tile
that you buy from a supplier.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.600
And we were taken by the monumental
scale of the material

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.720
and the actions to extract it.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.760
And looking carefully,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.320
we noticed hundreds of irregular
blocks piling up everywhere.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.760
They are the leftovers
of an extraction sequence:

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.920
the ugly parts that nobody wants.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.200
But we wanted them.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.000
We were inspired.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.640
And it was a win-win situation

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.480
where we could get this residual
material of great quality,

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.760
doomed to be crushed,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.200
at a very low cost.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.960
Now, we had to convince our clients
that this was a good idea;

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.640
but foremost, we had to come up
with a design process

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.040
to reuse these randomly shaped rocks,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.760
and we had not done this before.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.600
Today everything would be much easier

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.560
because we would go to the quarry

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.040
with our smartphones
equipped with 3-D scanners

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.400
and we would document each rock,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.640
turn that into a digital model --

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.880
highly engineer the whole process.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.560
But more than a decade ago,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.880
we had to embrace uncertainty

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.040
and put on our boots, roll up our sleeves

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.840
and move to the quarry
for a hands-on experience.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.640
And we also had to become the contractors

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.560
because we failed at finding somebody
willing to share the risk with us.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.040
Now, luckily, we convinced the quarry team
to help us build a few prototypes

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.680
to resolve some of the technical details.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.560
And we agreed on a few mock-ups,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.080
but we got excited,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.360
and one stone led to another

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.240
until we succeeded to build

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.400
an 18-meter-long
by eight-meter-high structure

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.960
that recycled all the amorphous
material of the quarry,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.720
just supported by gravity --

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.000
no mortar and no ties.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.280
And once built and tested,

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.720
moving it to the final site
in the city center

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.240
to unite it with the rest of the building

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.600
was a piece of cake,

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.760
because by having isolated uncertainty

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.520
and managed risk in the controlled
environment of the quarry,

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.080
we were able to complete
the whole building in time

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.320
and on budget,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.040
even if using nonconventional
means and methods.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.600
And I still get goosebumps

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.120
when I see this big chunk
of the industrial landscape

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.600
in the city,

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.960
in a building,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.720
experienced by the visitors
and the neighbors.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.320
This building gave us
quite a few headaches,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.480
and so it could have well been
an exception in our work,

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.800
but instead it started to inform
a modus operandi

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.200
where every project
becomes this opportunity

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.120
to test the limits of a discipline
we believe has to be urgently reimagined.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.680
So what you see here are four homes

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.280
that we have designed,
built and inhabited.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.720
Four manifestos where
we are using the small scale

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.160
to ask ourselves big questions.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.200
And we are trying to discover
the architectures

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.400
that result from unconventional
applications of pretty mundane materials

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.920
and technologies,

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.200
like concrete in different forms
in the top row,

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.240
or steel and foam in the bottom row.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.440
Take, for instance,
these precast concrete beams.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.240
You have probably seen them

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.880
building bridges, highways,
water channels --

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.440
we found them on one of our visits
to a precast concrete factory.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.920
And they might not seem
especially homey or beautiful,

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.040
but we decided to use them
to build our first house.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.040
And this was an incredible moment

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.480
because we got to be architects as always,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.800
builders once more

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.160
and, for the first time,
we could be our own clients.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.960
So, here we are trying to figure out
how we can take these huge catalogue beams

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.200
of about 20 tons each

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.320
and stack them progressively
around a courtyard space ...

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.280
the heart of the house.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.120
And due to the dimensions
and their material quality,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.520
these big parts are the structure
that carry the loads to the ground,

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.560
but they are much more than that.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.520
They are the swimming pool;

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.440
they are the walls that divide
interior from exterior;

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.160
they are the windows that frame the views;

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.600
they are the finishes;

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.800
they are the very spirit of this house.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.080
A house that is for us a laboratory

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.960
where we are testing how we can use
standard elements in nonstandard ways.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.960
And we are observing
that the results are intriguing.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.360
And we are learning by doing

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.440
that prefabrication
can be much more than stacking boxes

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.840
or that heavy parts
can be airy and transparent.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.080
And on top of designing
and building this house,

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.440
we get invaluable feedback,

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.560
sharing it with our family
and our friends

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.480
because this is our life

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.160
and our work in progress.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.480
The lessons that we learn here
get translated into other projects

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.480
and other programs

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.600
and other scales as well,

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.880
and they inspire new work.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.040
Here again we are looking
at very standard products:

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.840
galvanized steel studs
that can be easily cut and screwed,

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.160
insulating foams, cement boards --

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.800
all materials that you can find
hidden in partition walls

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.760
and that we are exposing;

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.520
and we are using them to build
a very lightweight construction system

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.760
that can be built almost by anyone.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.080
And we are doing it ourselves
with our hands in our shop,

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.280
and we are architects.
We're not professional builders

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.600
but we want to make sure it's possible.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.080
And it's so nice that Antón
can move it with his hands

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.720
and Javier can put it in a container,

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.320
and we can ship it

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.560
like you would ship your belongings
if you were moving abroad ...

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.440
which is what we did five years ago.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.400
We moved our gravity center from Madrid

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.400
and the house of the concrete
beams to Brookline.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:55.200
And we found the ugly duckling
of a very nice neighborhood:

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.080
a one-story garage
and the only thing we could afford.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.160
But it was OK because we wanted
to transform it into a swan,

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.840
installing on top
our just-delivered kit of parts,

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.160
once more becoming the scientists
and the guinea pigs.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.560
So this is a house
that uses some of the cheapest

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.200
and most normal materials
that you can find in the market

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.160
that applies the ubiquitous
four-by-eight modulation

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.560
that governs the construction industry.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.080
And yet a different
organization of the spaces

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.480
and a different assembly of the parts

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.000
is able to transform
an economically built home

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.440
into a luxurious space.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:44.760
And now, we're dreaming and we're
actively working with developers,

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:46.000
with builders,

00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:47.679
with communities

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.240
to try to make this a reality
for many more homes

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.720
and many more families.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.920
And you see, the world around us
is an infinite source of inspiration

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.200
if we are curious enough
to see beneath the surface of things.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.880
Now I'm going to take you
to the other side of the moon:

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.160
to the sublime landscape of Montana,

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.360
where a few years ago
we joined Cathy and Peter Halstead

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:18.840
to imagine Tippet Rise Art Center
on a 10,000-acre working ranch.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.840
And when we first visited the site,

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.200
we realized that all we knew
about what an art center is

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.400
was absolutely pointless for that client,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.800
for that community, for that landscape.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:37.320
The kind of white-box museum type
had no fit here.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:42.840
So we decided to explode the center
into a constellation of fragments,

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.560
of spaces spread
across the vast territory

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:51.600
that would immerse the visitors
into the wilderness of this amazing place.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.800
So back in the office,
we are thinking through making,

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.120
using the land both as support
and as material,

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:03.040
learning from its geological processes
of sedimentation, erosion,

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.360
fragmentation, crystallization --

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.240
explosion --

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.760
to discover architectures
that are born from the land,

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:15.120
that are visceral extensions
of the landscape,

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.360
like this bridge
that crosses Murphy Canyon.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.640
Or this fountain.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.160
Like this space topping a hill ...

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.240
or this theatre that brings to us
the space of the mountains

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.600
and its sound.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.480
And in order to realize this idea,

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.400
construction cannot be perfectly planned.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.160
We need to embrace the drastic weather
and the local craft.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.840
We need to control
just those aspects that are critical,

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.600
like the structural, the thermal,

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.800
the acoustical properties
embedded in the form.

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.960
But otherwise, improvisation
is welcome and is provoked.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.720
And the moment of construction
is still a moment of design

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.120
and a moment of celebration

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:05.040
where different hands, hearts, minds
come together to perform a final dance.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.480
And the result then cannot be anticipated.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.840
It comes as a surprise.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.600
And we unwrap architecture
like you would unwrap a birthday gift.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.920
Architecture isn't uncovered:

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.280
it's discovered.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.760
It's extracted from the guts
of the earth to build a shelter,

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.400
one of the most basic human needs.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.040
Architecture, art, landscape,

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.800
archaeology, geology -- all made one.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.760
And by using the resources
at our disposal in radical ways,

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.480
by making a space for experimentation,

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:52.200
we are able to bring to light
architectures that find the beauty latent

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:55.240
in the raw and imperfect
things that surround us,

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.160
that elevate them

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.160
and let them speak their own language.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:03.960
Thank you.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.280
(Applause)
