00:00:13.375 --> 00:00:16.833
This is the sound of orcas
off the coast of Vancouver.

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:22.417
(Whale chirps and squeaks)

00:00:23.417 --> 00:00:26.309
They make these fantastic sounds
not just to communicate,

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.476
but also sometimes to echolocate,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.917
to find their way around and to find food.

00:00:31.417 --> 00:00:33.059
But that can be tricky sometimes,

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:36.351
because, well, here is the sound
of a ship passing by,

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:37.934
recorded underwater.

00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:43.042
(Screeching oscillating sound)

00:00:44.452 --> 00:00:46.643
You know, when we think
about marine pollution,

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:48.684
I think we usually think about plastics.

00:00:48.708 --> 00:00:50.309
Maybe toxic chemicals,

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:53.434
or even ocean acidification
from climate change.

00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:56.893
As a science journalist who often writes
about environmental issues,

00:00:56.917 --> 00:00:59.059
those are the things
that have passed my desk

00:00:59.083 --> 00:01:01.059
over the past 10 years or so.

00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:02.351
But as I recently realized

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:05.434
when I was writing a feature
for the science journal "Nature,"

00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:08.726
noise is another
important kind of pollution.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.417
One that often gets ignored.

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:14.393
You know, maybe you've heard
of the dark-skies movement,

00:01:14.417 --> 00:01:17.893
which aimed to raise awareness
of the issue of light pollution

00:01:17.917 --> 00:01:20.601
and create pockets of unilluminated night,

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:22.518
so that people and animals

00:01:22.542 --> 00:01:27.726
could enjoy more natural cycles
of light and dark, night and day.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.059
Well, in much the same way,

00:01:29.083 --> 00:01:30.934
there are people now raising awareness

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:32.518
of the issue of noise pollution

00:01:32.542 --> 00:01:35.726
and trying to create
pockets of quiet in the ocean,

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.583
so that marine life can enjoy
a more natural soundscape.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.809
This is important.

00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:44.393
Noise isn't just an irritation.

00:01:44.417 --> 00:01:46.518
It can cause chronic stress,

00:01:46.542 --> 00:01:48.268
or even physical injury.

00:01:48.292 --> 00:01:51.726
It can affect marine life's ability
to find food and mates

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.583
and to listen out for predators and more.

00:01:55.792 --> 00:01:59.018
Think of all the sounds
we inject into the ocean.

00:01:59.042 --> 00:02:01.934
Perhaps one of the most dramatic
is the seismic surveys

00:02:01.958 --> 00:02:04.434
used to look for oil and gas.

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:06.684
Air guns produce loud blasts,

00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:09.143
sometimes every 10 to 15 seconds,

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:10.726
for months on end.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.809
And they use the reflections
of these sounds

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:14.559
to map the ground beneath.

00:02:14.583 --> 00:02:16.042
It can sound like this.

00:02:17.917 --> 00:02:22.583
(Explosion sounds)

00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:27.184
Then, there's the sound
of the actual drilling for oil and gas,

00:02:27.208 --> 00:02:30.393
the construction of things
like offshore wind farms,

00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:31.684
sonar

00:02:31.708 --> 00:02:35.726
and of course, the nearly constant drone
from more than 50,000 ships

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.667
in the global merchant fleet.

00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:41.268
Now the natural ocean itself
isn't exactly quiet.

00:02:41.292 --> 00:02:43.059
If you put your head under the water,

00:02:43.083 --> 00:02:46.643
you can hear cracking ice, wind, rain,

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:48.768
singing whales, grunting fish,

00:02:48.792 --> 00:02:50.684
even snapping shrimp.

00:02:50.708 --> 00:02:52.726
Altogether, that can create a soundscape

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.851
of maybe 50 to 100 decibels,

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:57.809
depending on where and when you are.

00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:00.601
But mankind's addition to that
has been dramatic.

00:03:00.625 --> 00:03:05.101
It's estimated that shipping has added
three decibels of noise to the ocean

00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:07.976
every 10 years in recent decades.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.559
That might not sound like a lot,

00:03:09.583 --> 00:03:11.726
but decibels are on a logarithmic scale,

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.643
like the Richter scale for earthquakes.

00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:17.309
So a small number can actually
represent a large change.

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:21.684
Three decibels means a doubling
of noise intensity in the ocean.

00:03:21.708 --> 00:03:22.958
A doubling.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.143
And that's only an estimate,

00:03:25.167 --> 00:03:28.309
because no one is actually keeping track
of how noisy the ocean is

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.226
all around the world.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.309
There is a body called
the International Quiet Ocean Experiment,

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:35.601
and one of their missions

00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:38.125
is to try and plug the hole in that data.

00:03:39.542 --> 00:03:40.809
So for example, last year,

00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:44.309
they managed to convince
the Global Ocean Observation System

00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:45.601
to start including noise

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:48.184
as one of their essential
variables for monitoring,

00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:51.000
alongside things
like temperature and salinity.

00:03:52.208 --> 00:03:53.476
We do know some things.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.101
We know that sonar can be as loud,
or nearly as loud,

00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:58.976
as an underwater volcano.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.184
A supertanker can be as loud
as the call of a blue whale.

00:04:03.208 --> 00:04:06.268
The noises we add to the ocean
come in all different frequencies

00:04:06.292 --> 00:04:08.351
and can travel great distances.

00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:11.393
Seismic surveys off the East Coast
of the United States

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:14.768
can be heard in the middle
of the Atlantic.

00:04:14.792 --> 00:04:16.768
In the 1960s, they did an experiment

00:04:16.792 --> 00:04:20.018
where they set off a loud noise
off the coast of Perth, Australia,

00:04:20.042 --> 00:04:22.476
and they detected it
as far away as Bermuda,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.375
20,000 kilometers away.

00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:30.393
So what does all this
sound like to marine life,

00:04:30.417 --> 00:04:31.684
what do they hear?

00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:33.434
It's kind of difficult to describe.

00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:36.643
Sound travels further, faster in water
than it does in air,

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:39.226
and it also packs a different punch.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.393
So sound of the same pressure
will have a different intensity

00:04:42.417 --> 00:04:45.893
whether you measure it
in the air or underwater.

00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:50.101
Then there's the fact that whales
don't have ears exactly like human ears.

00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:51.559
Creatures like zooplankton

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:55.101
don't even have what you would
consider to be ears.

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:56.393
So what does this mean,

00:04:56.417 --> 00:04:59.250
what is the impact
on all this marine life?

00:05:00.042 --> 00:05:02.393
Perhaps the easiest thing
for scientists to assess

00:05:02.417 --> 00:05:03.934
is the effect of acute noise,

00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.851
really loud sudden blasts

00:05:05.875 --> 00:05:08.625
that might cause physical injury
or hearing loss.

00:05:09.458 --> 00:05:12.893
Beaked whales, for example,
can go into panicked dives

00:05:12.917 --> 00:05:14.726
when exposed to loud noises,

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.167
which may even give them
a condition similar to the bends.

00:05:19.167 --> 00:05:23.518
In the 1960s, after the introduction
of more powerful sonar technologies,

00:05:23.542 --> 00:05:27.434
the number of incidents of mass
whale strandings of beaked whales

00:05:27.458 --> 00:05:28.875
went up dramatically.

00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:31.601
And it's not just marine mammals,

00:05:31.625 --> 00:05:35.893
fish, if they stray too close
to the source of a loud sound,

00:05:35.917 --> 00:05:39.184
their fish bladders may actually explode.

00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:41.268
The airgun blasts from seismic surveys

00:05:41.292 --> 00:05:44.018
can mow down a swath of zooplankton,

00:05:44.042 --> 00:05:46.684
the tiny creatures near the base
of the food chain,

00:05:46.708 --> 00:05:49.958
or can deform scallop larvae
while they're developing.

00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:53.518
Well, what about chronic noise,

00:05:53.542 --> 00:05:56.268
the more pervasive issue
of raising background noise

00:05:56.292 --> 00:05:57.768
from things like shipping?

00:05:57.792 --> 00:06:01.643
That can mask or drown out
the natural soundscape.

00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:05.351
Some whales have responded to this
by literally changing their tune,

00:06:05.375 --> 00:06:09.768
a little bit like people
shouting to be heard in a noisy nightclub.

00:06:09.792 --> 00:06:13.518
And some fish will spend more time
patrolling their borders

00:06:13.542 --> 00:06:15.851
and less time caring for their young,

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:17.708
as if they're on high alert.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.184
Chronic noise can affect
people too, of course.

00:06:23.208 --> 00:06:26.059
Studies have shown
that people living near busy airports

00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:27.601
or really busy highways

00:06:27.625 --> 00:06:30.893
may have elevated levels
of cardiovascular disease.

00:06:30.917 --> 00:06:33.309
And students living
under busy flight paths

00:06:33.333 --> 00:06:36.226
may do worse on some educational tests.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.184
And even while I was
researching this subject,

00:06:39.208 --> 00:06:42.351
they were actually blasting out
about three meters of solid granite

00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:44.768
from the lot across from my home office

00:06:44.792 --> 00:06:46.393
to make room for a new house,

00:06:46.417 --> 00:06:48.684
and the constant jittering
of the rock hammer

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:51.434
was driving me completely insane.

00:06:51.458 --> 00:06:54.018
And whenever the workers
stopped for a moment,

00:06:54.042 --> 00:06:56.167
I could feel my shoulders relax.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.143
This effect has been seen in whales, too.

00:07:00.167 --> 00:07:02.768
After the terrorist attacks of 9/11,

00:07:02.792 --> 00:07:05.976
international shipping largely
ground to a halt for a little while

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.059
in the waters off the East Coast
of the United States.

00:07:09.083 --> 00:07:10.351
And in that lull,

00:07:10.375 --> 00:07:13.643
researchers noticed that endangered
right whales in that region

00:07:13.667 --> 00:07:17.458
had fewer chemical markers of stress
in their feces samples.

00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:20.893
As one researcher I spoke to likes to say,

00:07:20.917 --> 00:07:23.625
"We were stressed,
but the whales weren't."

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.768
Now you have to remember,

00:07:26.792 --> 00:07:29.018
we have evolved to be a visual species.

00:07:29.042 --> 00:07:31.268
We really rely on our eyes.

00:07:31.292 --> 00:07:33.434
But marine life relies on sound

00:07:33.458 --> 00:07:35.792
the way that we rely on sight.

00:07:37.458 --> 00:07:39.809
For them, a noisy ocean

00:07:39.833 --> 00:07:43.268
may be as befuddling and even dangerous

00:07:43.292 --> 00:07:45.542
as a dense fog is for us.

00:07:46.625 --> 00:07:50.226
And maybe sometimes that just means
being a little more stressed,

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.434
maybe sometimes it means
spending a little less time with the kids.

00:07:53.458 --> 00:07:55.851
Maybe some species can adapt.

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:58.601
But some researchers worry
that for endangered species

00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:00.018
already on the brink,

00:08:00.042 --> 00:08:02.667
noise may be enough
to push them over the edge.

00:08:03.917 --> 00:08:06.643
So take, for example,
the southern resident killer whales

00:08:06.667 --> 00:08:09.559
that live in the waters
off my hometown of Vancouver.

00:08:09.583 --> 00:08:12.934
There are only 75, maybe 76, animals left

00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:14.476
in this population.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.893
And they're facing a lot of challenges.

00:08:16.917 --> 00:08:19.434
There are chemical pollutants
in these waters,

00:08:19.458 --> 00:08:23.726
and they are running low on the salmon
that they really rely on for food.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.393
And then there's noise.

00:08:25.417 --> 00:08:28.143
When researchers studied these
and similar killer whales,

00:08:28.167 --> 00:08:32.351
they found that they spend
between 18 and 25 percent less time

00:08:32.375 --> 00:08:35.434
feeding in the presence
of loud boat noise.

00:08:35.458 --> 00:08:38.351
And that's a lot for a species
that's already struggling

00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:40.375
to find enough food to thrive.

00:08:41.583 --> 00:08:44.976
The good news, as I heard
from all the researchers I spoke to,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.976
is that you can do something
relatively easily about ocean noise.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.684
Unlike the wicked problems
of climate change

00:08:51.708 --> 00:08:53.309
and ocean acidification,

00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:55.976
you can just dial down
the knob on ocean noise

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.167
and see almost immediate impacts.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.726
So for example, in 2017,

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.101
the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority

00:09:04.125 --> 00:09:06.768
started asking ships to simply slow down

00:09:06.792 --> 00:09:08.684
when going through the Haro Strait,

00:09:08.708 --> 00:09:12.268
where the southern resident killer whales
are feeding in late summer.

00:09:12.292 --> 00:09:14.851
Slower ships are quieter ships.

00:09:14.875 --> 00:09:17.143
And because it's Canada, you can just ask,

00:09:17.167 --> 00:09:18.434
it can be voluntary.

00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:19.726
(Laughter)

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:24.643
(Applause)

00:09:24.667 --> 00:09:27.768
In that 2017 trial,
most of the ships complied,

00:09:27.792 --> 00:09:30.018
adding about half an hour
to their travel time,

00:09:30.042 --> 00:09:32.809
and reducing noise by about 1.2 decibels

00:09:32.833 --> 00:09:35.851
or 24 percent of noise intensity.

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:38.643
This year, they decided
to extend the length of time

00:09:38.667 --> 00:09:41.559
and the area over which
they're asking ships to slow down.

00:09:41.583 --> 00:09:44.958
So hopefully that has
a positive impact for these whales.

00:09:46.542 --> 00:09:48.851
In 2017, the Vancouver
Fraser Port Authority

00:09:48.875 --> 00:09:51.768
also introduced discounts in docking fees

00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:55.018
for ships that are physically
designed to be quieter.

00:09:55.042 --> 00:09:57.809
You know, weirdly, a lot of the noise
from a ship like this

00:09:57.833 --> 00:10:01.476
comes from the popping of tiny bubbles
off the back of its propeller.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.601
And you can simply design a ship
to do less of that

00:10:04.625 --> 00:10:06.518
and to be quieter.

00:10:06.542 --> 00:10:10.309
The International Maritime Organization
has published a huge list of ways

00:10:10.333 --> 00:10:12.851
that boats can be made quieter.

00:10:12.875 --> 00:10:15.101
And they also have a target

00:10:15.125 --> 00:10:17.809
of reducing carbon dioxide emissions
from global shipping

00:10:17.833 --> 00:10:20.351
by 50 percent by 2050.

00:10:20.375 --> 00:10:23.434
And the great news is that
these two things go hand in hand.

00:10:23.458 --> 00:10:26.958
On the whole, a more
efficient ship is a quieter ship.

00:10:29.167 --> 00:10:33.059
People have also invented quieter ways
of hammering in the giant posts

00:10:33.083 --> 00:10:35.684
needed for giant
wind turbines, like this one,

00:10:35.708 --> 00:10:38.684
and gentler ways of doing seismic surveys.

00:10:38.708 --> 00:10:42.101
And there are some incentives
for using quieter technologies.

00:10:42.125 --> 00:10:43.851
The European Union, for example,

00:10:43.875 --> 00:10:47.351
has a healthy marine system
directive for 2020.

00:10:47.375 --> 00:10:50.268
And one of the ways that they define
a healthy marine system

00:10:50.292 --> 00:10:53.518
is by how much noise
is going in those waters.

00:10:53.542 --> 00:10:57.268
But on the whole, most waters
remain completely unregulated

00:10:57.292 --> 00:10:59.042
when it comes to ocean noise.

00:11:00.125 --> 00:11:02.184
But again, most of
the scientists I spoke to

00:11:02.208 --> 00:11:05.018
said that there's real momentum
right now in policy circles

00:11:05.042 --> 00:11:06.518
to pay attention to this issue

00:11:06.542 --> 00:11:09.226
and maybe do something about this issue.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:13.393
We already know enough to say
that quieter seas are healthier seas.

00:11:13.417 --> 00:11:17.434
But now scientists are really scrambling
to come up with the details.

00:11:17.458 --> 00:11:19.434
Just how quiet do we need to be?

00:11:19.458 --> 00:11:23.934
And where are the best places
to make quiet or preserve quiet?

00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:26.375
And how best can we hush our noise?

00:11:27.667 --> 00:11:29.601
And you know, I'm not trying to tell you

00:11:29.625 --> 00:11:32.518
that noise is the biggest
environmental problem on the planet

00:11:32.542 --> 00:11:33.809
or even in the ocean.

00:11:33.833 --> 00:11:37.643
But the point is that humankind
has a lot of impacts

00:11:37.667 --> 00:11:40.143
on our environmental system.

00:11:40.167 --> 00:11:42.309
And these impacts don't act in isolation.

00:11:42.333 --> 00:11:44.851
They act together, and they multiply.

00:11:44.875 --> 00:11:47.309
So even for the ones
that are not so obvious,

00:11:47.333 --> 00:11:50.000
we really need to pay attention to them.

00:11:51.917 --> 00:11:53.851
I'll tell you about one last experiment,

00:11:53.875 --> 00:11:55.476
just because it's so beautiful.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.768
So Rob Williams,

00:11:56.792 --> 00:12:00.018
one of the researchers who works
on southern resident killer whales,

00:12:00.042 --> 00:12:01.851
also does some work in Bali.

00:12:01.875 --> 00:12:03.934
And there, they celebrate
a Hindu tradition

00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.809
called nyepi, or a day of silence.

00:12:06.833 --> 00:12:09.768
And this day, apparently,
is very strictly observed.

00:12:09.792 --> 00:12:11.851
No planes take off from the airport,

00:12:11.875 --> 00:12:13.434
no boats go out fishing,

00:12:13.458 --> 00:12:18.018
the tourists are gently led off the beach
back into their hotel rooms.

00:12:18.042 --> 00:12:20.768
And Rob Williams put some
hydrophones in the water there

00:12:20.792 --> 00:12:22.184
to see what the impact was,

00:12:22.208 --> 00:12:23.518
and it was dramatic.

00:12:23.542 --> 00:12:26.268
Sound levels dropped
by six to nine decibels,

00:12:26.292 --> 00:12:29.643
about the same
as in the waters after 9/11.

00:12:29.667 --> 00:12:32.518
For an "acoustic prospector"
like Williams,

00:12:32.542 --> 00:12:34.434
which is what he calls himself,

00:12:34.458 --> 00:12:36.726
this silence is golden.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:40.018
Now he and other researchers
can go back to this place

00:12:40.042 --> 00:12:41.662
and see what the fish choose to do

00:12:41.686 --> 00:12:44.226
with all this additional
acoustic real estate.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:48.101
(Soft bubbling)

00:12:48.125 --> 00:12:51.101
I like to think of them
having their own holiday,

00:12:51.125 --> 00:12:53.434
feasting and finding mates.

00:12:53.458 --> 00:12:55.518
Celebrating their own spot of calm

00:12:55.542 --> 00:12:58.226
in an otherwise noisy world.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.518
Thank you.

00:12:59.542 --> 00:13:02.042
(Applause)
