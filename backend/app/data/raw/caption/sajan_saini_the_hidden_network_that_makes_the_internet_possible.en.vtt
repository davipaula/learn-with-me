00:00:07.016 --> 00:00:08.476
In 2012,

00:00:08.476 --> 00:00:13.136
a team of Japanese and Danish researchers
set a world record,

00:00:13.136 --> 00:00:15.716
transmitting 1 petabit of data—

00:00:15.716 --> 00:00:19.006
that’s 10,000 hours of high-def video—

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:22.526
over a fifty-kilometer cable, in a second.

00:00:22.526 --> 00:00:24.426
This wasn’t just any cable.

00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:27.466
It was a souped-up version 
of fiber optics—

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:29.766
the hidden network that links our planet

00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.236
and makes the internet possible.

00:00:32.236 --> 00:00:33.116
For decades,

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:36.496
long-distance communications 
between cities and countries

00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:38.546
were carried by electrical signals,

00:00:38.546 --> 00:00:40.266
in wires made of copper.

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:42.236
This was slow and inefficient,

00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:47.656
with metal wires limiting data rates 
and power lost as wasted heat.

00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:49.596
But in the late 20th century,

00:00:49.596 --> 00:00:53.596
engineers mastered a far superior method
of transmission.

00:00:53.596 --> 00:00:55.056
Instead of metal,

00:00:55.056 --> 00:01:00.146
glass can be carefully melted and 
drawn into flexible fiber strands,

00:01:00.146 --> 00:01:04.535
hundreds of kilometers long 
and no thicker than human hair.

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:06.237
And instead of electricity,

00:01:06.237 --> 00:01:11.487
these strands carry pulses of light, 
representing digital data.

00:01:11.487 --> 00:01:16.227
But how does light travel within glass, 
rather than just pass through it?

00:01:16.227 --> 00:01:21.511
The trick lies in a phenomenon known 
as total internal reflection.

00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:23.168
Since Isaac Newton’s time,

00:01:23.168 --> 00:01:26.798
lensmakers and scientists have 
known that light bends

00:01:26.798 --> 00:01:31.588
when it passes between air and 
materials like water or glass.

00:01:31.588 --> 00:01:36.239
When a ray of light inside glass hits its 
surface at a steep angle,

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:39.969
it refracts, or bends 
as it exits into air.

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.959
But if the ray travels at a shallow angle,

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:46.029
it’ll bend so far that it stays trapped,

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:48.949
bouncing along inside the glass.

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:50.319
Under the right condition,

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:55.549
something normally transparent to light
can instead hide it from the world.

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.991
Compared to electricity or radio,

00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:01.781
fiber optic signals barely degrade 
over great distances—

00:02:01.781 --> 00:02:04.051
a little power does scatter away,

00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:06.581
and fibers can’t bend too sharply,

00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:08.491
otherwise the light leaks out.

00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:12.791
Today, a single optical fiber carries many
wavelengths of light,

00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:15.256
each a different channel of data.

00:02:15.256 --> 00:02:19.466
And a fiber optic cable contains hundreds 
of these fiber strands.

00:02:19.466 --> 00:02:23.445
Over a million kilometers of cable 
crisscross our ocean floors

00:02:23.445 --> 00:02:25.045
to link the continents—

00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:29.435
that’s enough to wind around the 
Equator nearly thirty times.

00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:30.631
With fiber optics,

00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:32.851
distance hardly limits data,

00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:36.851
which has allowed the internet to evolve
into a planetary computer.

00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:37.651
Increasingly,

00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:43.221
our mobile work and play rely on legions 
of overworked computer servers,

00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:47.161
warehoused in gigantic data centers 
flung across the world.

00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:49.081
This is called cloud computing,

00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:51.361
and it leads to two big problems:

00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:54.144
heat waste and bandwidth demand.

00:02:54.144 --> 00:02:58.844
The vast majority of internet traffic 
shuttles around inside data centers,

00:02:58.844 --> 00:03:03.544
where thousands of servers are connected 
by traditional electrical cables.

00:03:03.544 --> 00:03:06.286
Half of their running power 
is wasted as heat.

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:10.446
Meanwhile, wireless bandwidth demand 
steadily marches on,

00:03:10.446 --> 00:03:13.536
and the gigahertz signals used in our 
mobile devices

00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:16.336
are reaching their data delivery limits.

00:03:16.336 --> 00:03:19.866
It seems fiber optics has been too good
for its own good,

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:24.576
fueling overly-ambitious cloud and mobile
computing expectations.

00:03:24.576 --> 00:03:29.826
But a related technology, integrated 
photonics, has come to the rescue.

00:03:29.827 --> 00:03:32.857
Light can be guided not 
only in optical fibers,

00:03:32.857 --> 00:03:36.217
but also in ultrathin silicon wires.

00:03:36.217 --> 00:03:39.547
Silicon wires don’t guide light
as well as fiber.

00:03:39.547 --> 00:03:42.117
But they do enable engineers to shrink

00:03:42.117 --> 00:03:45.597
all the devices in a hundred kilometer 
fiber optic network

00:03:45.597 --> 00:03:49.237
down to tiny photonic chips that plug
into servers

00:03:49.237 --> 00:03:53.327
and convert their electrical signals 
to optical and back.

00:03:53.327 --> 00:03:59.429
These electricity-to-light chips allow for
wasteful electrical cables in data centers

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:02.809
to be swapped out for 
power-efficient fiber.

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:07.379
Photonic chips can help break open 
wireless bandwidth limitations, too.

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.861
Researchers are working to replace mobile
gigahertz signals

00:04:10.861 --> 00:04:12.651
with terahertz frequencies,

00:04:12.651 --> 00:04:15.581
to carry data thousands of times faster.

00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:17.621
But these are short-range signals:

00:04:17.621 --> 00:04:19.721
they get absorbed by moisture in the air,

00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:21.961
or blocked by tall buildings.

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:25.331
With tiny wireless-to-fiber photonic 
transmitter chips

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:27.001
distributed throughout cities,

00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:31.431
terahertz signals can be relayed over 
long-range distances.

00:04:31.431 --> 00:04:34.069
They can do so via a stable middleman,

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:39.429
optical fiber, and make hyperfast 
wireless connectivity a reality.

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:41.303
For all of human history,

00:04:41.303 --> 00:04:43.893
light has gifted us with sight and heat,

00:04:43.893 --> 00:04:49.183
serving as a steady companion while we
explored and settled the physical world.

00:04:49.183 --> 00:04:52.812
Now, we’ve saddled light with information
and redirected it

00:04:52.812 --> 00:04:55.762
to run along a fiber optic superhighway—

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:59.102
with many different integrated 
photonic exits—

00:04:59.102 --> 00:05:02.882
to build an even more expansive, 
virtual world.
