Reviewer: Rhonda Jacobs

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.224
We have known for a long time
that air pollution kills people.

00:00:18.248 --> 00:00:23.191
We also know that a climate
emergency is happening.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.086
These are hardly motivating
facts to start a conversation,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.210
but I'm actually here to share good news.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.216
For the first time in our lifetimes,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.866
a big detox of transportation is possible,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.716
despite the many problems we have,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.793
or perhaps because of them.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.746
The lockdowns of 2020 have been tough,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.586
but they also give us a glimpse of life

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.426
without the usual noise,
congestion and pollution,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.870
confronting us with questions
about the way we live.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.756
The tailpipe is a symbol
of our worst habits --

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.506
habits that we have
normalized for too long:

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.066
the burning of 100 million
barrels of oil every 24 hours

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.996
and the extraction behind that oil,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.706
the fumes choking our cities,

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.846
the greenhouse gases
going up in the atmosphere

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.346
and overheating our planet.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.496
None of that is normal,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.796
nor is air pollution,

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.276
which can shorten life expectancy
by up to 10 years,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.376
depending on where you live.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.266
This is also a matter
of environmental justice

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.521
because air pollution hurts everyone,

00:01:43.545 --> 00:01:48.536
but it hurts the poor
and minorities disproportionately.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.546
The good news is that things are changing.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.236
Take cities.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.086
First, people around the world
are demanding clean air

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.196
and cities are responding

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.356
by banning petrol and diesel cars,

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.676
mostly by 2030 and 2040;

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.686
over 30 cities and regions
are already doing this.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.280
Second, the city space
is going through an overhaul.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.856
Too much space was given to cars,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.906
and cities are reversing this
by blocking traffic from certain streets,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.546
by giving the streets back to pedestrians,

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.656
by making the streets greener and safer,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.746
especially for children.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.026
And third, cities are also
prioritizing active mobility,

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.726
such as biking and walking.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.706
And the pandemic accelerated
many of these decisions.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.926
From Barcelona to BogotÃ¡,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.046
cities are opening spaces
for bike lanes, for commuters.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.496
Sales of bikes and e-bikes
are booming in many places.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.716
Paris is pioneering the 15-minute city

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.966
to put essentials
within a walk or a bike ride,

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.656
all within 15 minutes.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.806
I live in Amsterdam, where a profound
transformation is underway.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.026
Amsterdam already promotes
biking, public transit, walking.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.086
So you might be surprised
to hear that even in Amsterdam

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.936
there is a problem with air pollution
because of road transportation.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.376
That is why the city
of Amsterdam has a plan

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.336
to go emissions-free by 2030.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.906
And the plan builds on the idea
of an expanding zero-emission zone

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.476
going from the center
outwards in three phases.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.356
By 2022, all buses and coaches circulating
in the city center must be emissions-free.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.136
By 2025, the zone expands

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.246
and all public and commercial traffic
must be emissions-free.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.506
Public buses, coaches, taxis, vans,

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.190
small, medium and large trucks.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.540
That also includes
mopeds, ferries and boats.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.006
By 2030, the zone expands further,

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.036
and by then all transportation
must be emissions-free,

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.313
including personal cars and motorcycles.

00:04:23.677 --> 00:04:25.726
No more tailpipes.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.660
And that is just nine years away.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.086
Living here and witnessing firsthand

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.416
how Amsterdam becomes
a front-runner of electric mobility

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.976
is a powerful reminder

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.513
that the big societal imperative
of halving carbon emissions

00:04:45.537 --> 00:04:47.235
by 2030

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.866
goes beyond nudging people
away from personal cars.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.296
The systemic change we need

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.756
requires that all modes
of transportation go emissions-free

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.606
powered by renewables,

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.116
and we have to achieve
that while making sure

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.706
that our needs are met
as citizens and as business.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.346
And to do this, we need to
electrify pretty much everything.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.016
Cities cannot do this alone,

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.346
so we need national governments
to play a fundamental role too.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.926
The European Union, for example,

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.606
has CO2 emission standards
for vehicle manufacturers,

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.826
and over a dozen of European
countries have set up plans

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.856
to phase out petrol and diesel cars --

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.956
France by 2040,

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.470
the United Kingdom by 2035.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.746
China and California have mandates

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.826
to accelerate the manufacturing
of zero-emission models.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.296
California just passed a rule

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.706
that requires that 50 percent
of the sales of trucks in the state

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.776
are zero-emissions by 2035

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.776
and all of them must be
zero-emission by 2045.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.463
This is a game changer
for the trucking industry.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.396
Vehicle manufacturing
is shifting towards electrification.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.906
Look at some of the milestones,

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.126
which were unthinkable a few years back.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.276
Volkswagen has converted
a traditional plant

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.416
into one that will produce
only electric vehicles.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:28.856
Daimler is halting all the development
of internal combustion engines.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.873
And Tesla is more valuable
today than ExxonMobil.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:40.506
This year, public charging plugs
hit the one million mark

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.996
around the world.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.570
Fleet owners are shifting
towards zero-emission models.

00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:53.076
Amazon alone has ordered
100,000 electric delivery vans

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:58.266
and nearly 90 global
companies have joined EV100,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.626
an international initiative

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.716
to electrify fleets by 2030 starting now.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.356
These are still small steps

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.266
compared to the scale
of our oil addiction,

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:16.290
but they signal a new direction of travel.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.976
What's really exciting

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.796
is that the technologies we need
for this transformation are here today,

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.376
commercially available,

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.806
getting cheaper and getting better.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.646
Look at batteries.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:34.326
Their cost went down
90 percent in 10 years,

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.386
and there are new opportunities
to repurpose these batteries

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.486
for energy storage

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.386
or to recycle them once they wear down.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.170
The race to zero needs capital.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.306
So we need more urgency
and directionality

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.170
in the financial industry

00:07:51.194 --> 00:07:55.740
because it is heavily
invested in fossil fuels.

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.086
To reach scale and speed,

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:02.763
we will need clever combinations
of finance and policy.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:06.110
Look at what's going on
with electric buses.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.256
China has a fleet

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.806
of 420,000 electric buses

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:19.800
compared to 600
in the entire United States.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.346
To put that into perspective,

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:28.111
Santiago de Chile alone
has 455 electric buses, and growing,

00:08:28.135 --> 00:08:31.156
thanks to an ingenious
financial arrangement.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:36.590
Africa now has its first
manufacturing plant of electric buses.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.376
And P4G, a global initiative,

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.676
is working with emerging economies

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.610
that want to scale up
the electrification of buses.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.338
Colombia is first in line,

00:08:48.362 --> 00:08:53.056
designing a fund of 2.2 billion dollars

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.258
to electrify 6,000 buses over time.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.564
There is, and there will be,
resistance to change.

00:09:00.588 --> 00:09:05.157
There is even an inability
to imagine that change is possible.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.799
In reality, change happens exponentially.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:11.983
Look at what happened to solar energy.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.874
Exponential change can bring turmoil

00:09:15.898 --> 00:09:20.166
if the decline of old
industries is not managed.

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:25.003
It can bring economic
dislocation and job disruption.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.786
So wouldn't it be wiser to prepare

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:34.943
and design just transitions
now rather than later?

00:09:36.579 --> 00:09:38.165
Here's the bottom line.

00:09:38.841 --> 00:09:43.286
The end of internal combustion
engine is within sight.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.886
The question is no longer
whether this will happen,

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.297
but when.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.266
Ten years?

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.466
Twenty years?

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:55.406
It depends on us and the choices
that we make this decade.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:10:00.016
So now is the time to go bigger and faster

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.325
towards a future without a tailpipe,

00:10:03.349 --> 00:10:06.536
a future where we can meet
our transportation needs

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.516
and have people-friendly streets,

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:14.616
a future with a thriving
economy and clean air,

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.920
a future we choose
for the climate and for our health.

00:10:21.009 --> 00:10:22.252
Thank you.
