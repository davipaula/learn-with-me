00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:28.230
I'd like to do pretty much
what I did the first time,

00:00:28.254 --> 00:00:31.374
which is to choose a lighthearted theme.

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:33.728
Last time, I talked about death and dying.

00:00:33.752 --> 00:00:34.754
(Laughter)

00:00:34.778 --> 00:00:37.201
This time, I'm going to talk
about mental illness.

00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:38.829
(Laughter)

00:00:38.853 --> 00:00:40.563
But it has to be technological,

00:00:40.587 --> 00:00:42.969
so I'll talk about electroshock therapy.

00:00:42.993 --> 00:00:45.132
(Laughter)

00:00:45.156 --> 00:00:48.792
You know, ever since man had any notion

00:00:48.816 --> 00:00:52.864
that some of his other people,
his colleagues,

00:00:52.888 --> 00:00:56.419
could be different, could be strange,
could be severely depressed

00:00:56.443 --> 00:00:59.251
or what we now recognize as schizophrenia,

00:01:00.338 --> 00:01:05.395
he was certain that this kind of illness
had to come from evil spirits

00:01:05.419 --> 00:01:06.571
getting into the body.

00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:09.870
So the way of treating
these diseases in early times

00:01:09.894 --> 00:01:12.967
was to, in some way or other,
exorcise those evil spirits.

00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:15.361
And this is still going on, as you know.

00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:18.419
But it wasn't enough to use the priests.

00:01:18.443 --> 00:01:23.133
When medicine became
somewhat scientific, in about 450 BC,

00:01:23.157 --> 00:01:25.055
with Hippocrates and those boys,

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.894
they tried to look for herbs, plants

00:01:28.918 --> 00:01:32.302
that would literally shake
the bad spirits out.

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:35.777
So they found certain plants
that could cause convulsions.

00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:37.016
And the herbals,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.473
the botanical books of up to the late
Middle Ages, the Renaissance,

00:01:42.497 --> 00:01:46.881
are filled with prescriptions
for causing convulsions

00:01:46.905 --> 00:01:49.723
to shake the evil spirits out.

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.262
Finally, in about the 16th century,

00:01:54.286 --> 00:02:00.516
a physician whose name was Theophrastus
Bombastus Aureolus von Hohenheim --

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.595
called Paracelsus, a name probably
familiar to some people here --

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.197
(Laughter)

00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:09.174
good old Paracelsus --

00:02:09.198 --> 00:02:13.120
found that he could predict
the degree of convulsion

00:02:13.144 --> 00:02:17.342
by using a measured amount of camphor
to produce the convulsion.

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:20.225
Can you imagine going to your closet,
pulling out a mothball

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:22.735
and chewing on it
if you're feeling depressed?

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.267
It's better than Prozac,
but I wouldn't recommend it.

00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:26.293
(Laughter)

00:02:26.317 --> 00:02:29.750
So, what we see in the 17th, 18th century

00:02:29.774 --> 00:02:33.976
is the continued search for medications
other than camphor that'll do the trick.

00:02:34.744 --> 00:02:36.580
Well, along comes Benjamin Franklin,

00:02:36.604 --> 00:02:38.588
and he comes close to convulsing himself

00:02:38.612 --> 00:02:41.456
with a bolt of electricity
off the end of his kite.

00:02:42.186 --> 00:02:47.085
And so people begin thinking in terms
of electricity to produce convulsions.

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.331
And then we fast-forward to about 1932,

00:02:51.355 --> 00:02:57.154
when three Italian psychiatrists
who were largely treating depression

00:02:57.178 --> 00:03:01.083
began to notice among their patients,
who were also epileptics,

00:03:01.107 --> 00:03:05.557
that if they had a series of epileptic
fits, a lot of them in a row --

00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:07.617
the depression would very frequently lift.

00:03:07.641 --> 00:03:10.458
Not only would it lift,
but it might never return.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.149
So they got very interested
in producing convulsions,

00:03:16.173 --> 00:03:17.976
measured types of convulsions.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.165
And they thought,

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:22.221
"Well, we've got electricity,
we'll plug somebody into the wall.

00:03:22.245 --> 00:03:24.946
That always makes hair stand up
and people shake a lot."

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.065
So they tried it on a few pigs,
and none of the pigs were killed.

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:30.694
So they went to the police and they said,

00:03:30.718 --> 00:03:32.816
"We know that at the Rome
railroad station,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.459
there are all these lost
souls wandering around,

00:03:35.483 --> 00:03:36.675
muttering gibberish.

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:38.319
Can you bring one of them to us?"

00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:42.396
Someone who is,
as the Italians say, "gagootz."

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.410
So they found this "gagootz" guy,

00:03:44.434 --> 00:03:47.714
a 39-year-old man who was really
hopelessly schizophrenic,

00:03:47.738 --> 00:03:50.696
who was known, had been known for months,

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.787
to be literally defecating on himself,

00:03:53.811 --> 00:03:55.976
talking nothing that made any sense,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.976
and they brought him into the hospital.

00:03:58.527 --> 00:04:00.113
So these three psychiatrists,

00:04:00.137 --> 00:04:02.397
after about two or three weeks
of observation,

00:04:02.421 --> 00:04:04.940
laid him down on a table,

00:04:04.964 --> 00:04:08.976
connected his temples
to a very small source of current.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.265
They thought, "Well, we'll try
55 volts, two-tenths of a second.

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:15.860
That's not going to do
anything terrible to him."

00:04:15.884 --> 00:04:17.440
So they did that.

00:04:17.464 --> 00:04:21.389
Well, I have the following
from a firsthand observer,

00:04:21.413 --> 00:04:23.976
who told me this about 35 years ago,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.510
when I was thinking about these things
for some research project of mine.

00:04:29.264 --> 00:04:33.483
He said, "This fellow" -- remember,
he wasn't even put to sleep --

00:04:33.507 --> 00:04:35.749
"after this major grand mal convulsion,

00:04:35.773 --> 00:04:37.084
sat right up,

00:04:37.108 --> 00:04:39.093
looked at these three fellas and said,

00:04:39.117 --> 00:04:42.173
'What the fuck are you assholes
trying to do?'"

00:04:42.197 --> 00:04:49.123
(Laughter)

00:04:50.242 --> 00:04:52.323
If I could only say that in Italian.

00:04:52.347 --> 00:04:53.728
(Laughter)

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:55.898
Well, they were happy as could be,

00:04:55.922 --> 00:05:00.142
because he hadn't said a rational word
in the weeks of observation.

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:02.214
(Laughter)

00:05:02.238 --> 00:05:04.976
So they plugged him in again,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.655
and this time, they used
110 volts for half a second.

00:05:10.042 --> 00:05:12.089
And to their amazement, after it was over,

00:05:12.113 --> 00:05:14.976
he began speaking
like he was perfectly well.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.145
He relapsed a little bit,
they gave him a series of treatments,

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.582
and he was essentially cured.

00:05:19.606 --> 00:05:22.200
But of course, having schizophrenia,

00:05:22.224 --> 00:05:24.484
within a few months, it returned.

00:05:24.508 --> 00:05:26.813
But they wrote a paper about this,

00:05:26.837 --> 00:05:31.103
and everybody in the western world
began using electricity

00:05:31.127 --> 00:05:33.656
to convulse people
who were either schizophrenic

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.837
or severely depressed.

00:05:34.861 --> 00:05:37.105
It didn't work very well
on the schizophrenics,

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:40.898
but it was pretty clear in the '30s
and by the middle of the '40s

00:05:40.922 --> 00:05:46.316
that electroconvulsive therapy
was very, very effective

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.927
in the treatment of depression.

00:05:47.951 --> 00:05:51.239
And of course, in those days,
there were no antidepressant drugs,

00:05:51.263 --> 00:05:52.934
and it became very, very popular.

00:05:54.148 --> 00:05:57.270
They would anesthetize people,
convulse them ...

00:05:57.294 --> 00:06:01.350
But the real difficulty was
that there was no way to paralyze muscles.

00:06:01.374 --> 00:06:04.800
So people would have
a real grand mal seizure.

00:06:04.824 --> 00:06:09.573
Bones were broken; especially in old,
fragile people, you couldn't use it.

00:06:09.597 --> 00:06:13.976
And then in the late 1950s,
the so-called "muscle relaxants"

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.244
were developed by pharmacologists,

00:06:16.268 --> 00:06:19.704
and it got so that you could
induce a complete convulsion,

00:06:19.728 --> 00:06:23.619
an electroencephalographic convulsion --
you could see it on the brain waves --

00:06:23.643 --> 00:06:25.858
without causing any convulsion in the body

00:06:25.882 --> 00:06:28.192
except a little bit
of twitching of the toes.

00:06:28.216 --> 00:06:33.227
So again, it was very, very
popular and very, very useful.

00:06:33.627 --> 00:06:38.892
Well, you know, in the middle '60s,
the first antidepressants came out.

00:06:38.916 --> 00:06:40.719
Tofranil was the first.

00:06:40.743 --> 00:06:43.729
In the late '70s, early '80s,
there were others,

00:06:43.753 --> 00:06:45.440
and they were very effective.

00:06:45.464 --> 00:06:48.414
And patients' rights groups
seemed to get very upset

00:06:48.438 --> 00:06:51.105
about the kinds of things
that they would witness,

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:57.953
so the whole idea of electroconvulsive,
electroshock therapy disappeared,

00:06:57.977 --> 00:07:01.071
but has had a renaissance
in the last 10 years.

00:07:01.095 --> 00:07:03.875
And the reason
that it has had a renaissance

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:09.489
is that probably about 10 percent
of the people, severe depressives,

00:07:09.513 --> 00:07:13.448
do not respond, regardless
of what is done for them.

00:07:14.808 --> 00:07:18.323
Now why am I telling you
this story at this meeting?

00:07:19.101 --> 00:07:21.502
I'm telling you this story
because, actually,

00:07:21.526 --> 00:07:24.608
ever since Richard called me
and asked me to talk about --

00:07:24.632 --> 00:07:26.302
as he asked all of his speakers --

00:07:26.326 --> 00:07:29.383
to talk about something
that would be new to this audience

00:07:29.407 --> 00:07:32.222
that we had never talked about,
never written about.

00:07:32.246 --> 00:07:33.986
I've been planning this moment.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:41.510
This reason really is that I am a man who,
almost 30 years ago,

00:07:41.534 --> 00:07:48.298
had his life saved by two long courses
of electroshock therapy.

00:07:48.322 --> 00:07:50.799
And let me tell you this story.

00:07:52.322 --> 00:07:56.410
I was, in the 1960s, in a marriage.

00:07:56.434 --> 00:08:00.598
To use the word "bad" would be perhaps
the understatement of the year.

00:08:00.622 --> 00:08:01.966
It was dreadful.

00:08:03.343 --> 00:08:06.846
There are, I'm sure,
enough divorced people in this room

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:11.496
to know about the hostility,
the anger, who knows what.

00:08:12.202 --> 00:08:16.976
Being someone who had had
a very difficult childhood,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.548
a very difficult adolescence --

00:08:18.572 --> 00:08:21.976
it had to do with
not quite poverty, but close.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.899
It had to do with being brought up
in a family where no one spoke English,

00:08:25.923 --> 00:08:27.663
no one could read or write English.

00:08:27.687 --> 00:08:30.976
It had to do with death and disease
and lots of other things.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.234
I was a little prone to depression.

00:08:33.258 --> 00:08:37.396
So, as things got worse,
as we really began to hate each other,

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:41.902
I became progressively depressed
over a period of a couple of years

00:08:41.926 --> 00:08:43.516
trying to save this marriage,

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.839
which was inevitably not to be saved.

00:08:47.525 --> 00:08:52.867
Finally, I would schedule --
all my major surgical cases,

00:08:52.891 --> 00:08:56.976
I was scheduling them for 12,
one o'clock in the afternoon,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.469
because I couldn't get out of bed
before about 11 o'clock.

00:09:01.493 --> 00:09:04.976
Anybody who's been depressed here
knows what that's like.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.708
I couldn't even pull
the covers off myself.

00:09:07.732 --> 00:09:10.004
Well, you're in a university
medical center,

00:09:10.028 --> 00:09:11.614
where everybody knows everybody.

00:09:11.638 --> 00:09:15.703
And it's perfectly clear to my colleagues,
so my referrals began to decrease.

00:09:15.727 --> 00:09:17.888
As my referrals began to decrease,

00:09:17.912 --> 00:09:21.685
I clearly became increasingly depressed,

00:09:21.709 --> 00:09:24.555
until I thought, "My God,
I can't work anymore."

00:09:24.579 --> 00:09:26.650
And, in fact, it didn't
make any difference,

00:09:26.674 --> 00:09:28.699
because I didn't have
any patients anymore.

00:09:28.723 --> 00:09:31.976
So, with the advice of my physician,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.595
I had myself admitted
to the acute care psychiatric unit

00:09:35.619 --> 00:09:37.488
of our university hospital.

00:09:37.512 --> 00:09:40.184
And my colleagues, who had known me
since medical school,

00:09:40.208 --> 00:09:42.371
in that place, said, "Don't worry, Shep.

00:09:42.395 --> 00:09:44.543
Six weeks, you're back
in the operating room.

00:09:44.567 --> 00:09:46.106
Everything's going to be great."

00:09:46.467 --> 00:09:48.922
Well, you know what bovine stercus is?

00:09:49.642 --> 00:09:53.215
That proved to be a lot of bovine stercus.

00:09:53.239 --> 00:09:55.842
(Laughter)

00:09:56.587 --> 00:10:01.311
I know some people who got tenure
in that place with lies like that.

00:10:01.335 --> 00:10:04.079
(Laughter)

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:06.889
(Laughter and applause)

00:10:06.913 --> 00:10:09.280
So I was one of their failures.

00:10:10.296 --> 00:10:11.759
But it wasn't that simple,

00:10:11.783 --> 00:10:14.070
because by the time
I got out of that unit,

00:10:14.094 --> 00:10:16.517
I was not functional at all.

00:10:16.541 --> 00:10:19.369
I could hardly see five feet
in front of myself.

00:10:19.803 --> 00:10:22.795
I shuffled when I walked.
I was bowed over.

00:10:22.819 --> 00:10:24.282
I rarely bathed.

00:10:24.306 --> 00:10:25.924
I sometimes didn't shave.

00:10:25.948 --> 00:10:27.483
It was dreadful.

00:10:27.507 --> 00:10:29.976
And it was clear -- not to me,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.430
because nothing was clear
to me at that time anymore --

00:10:33.454 --> 00:10:36.439
that I would need
long-term hospitalization

00:10:37.431 --> 00:10:41.186
in that awful place
called a "mental hospital."

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:46.976
So I was admitted, in the spring of 1973,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.538
to the Institute of Living, which used
to be called the Hartford Retreat.

00:10:50.562 --> 00:10:52.276
It was founded in the 18th century,

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.669
the largest psychiatric hospital
in the state of Connecticut,

00:10:56.693 --> 00:11:00.211
other than the huge public hospitals
that existed at that time.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.730
And they tried everything they had.

00:11:02.754 --> 00:11:04.472
They tried the usual psychotherapy.

00:11:04.496 --> 00:11:06.936
They tried every medication
available in those days.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.923
And they did have Tofranil and other
things -- Mellaril, who knows what.

00:11:10.947 --> 00:11:14.891
Nothing happened except that I got
jaundiced from one of these things.

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:16.592
And finally,

00:11:17.585 --> 00:11:21.974
because I was well-known in Connecticut,

00:11:21.998 --> 00:11:24.840
they decided they better have
a meeting of the senior staff.

00:11:24.864 --> 00:11:29.717
All the senior staff got together,
and I later found out what happened.

00:11:30.896 --> 00:11:33.250
They put all their heads together,

00:11:33.274 --> 00:11:36.898
and they decided that there was nothing
that could be done

00:11:36.922 --> 00:11:41.536
for this surgeon who had essentially
separated himself from the world,

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.976
who by that time had become
so overwhelmed,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.552
not just with depression and feelings
of worthlessness and inadequacy,

00:11:50.576 --> 00:11:52.728
but with obsessional thinking,

00:11:52.752 --> 00:11:55.087
obsessional thinking about coincidences.

00:11:55.111 --> 00:11:57.976
And there were particular numbers
that every time I saw them,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:04.720
just got me dreadfully upset,
all kinds of ritualistic observances ...

00:12:04.744 --> 00:12:06.343
just awful, awful stuff.

00:12:06.367 --> 00:12:09.431
Remember when you were a kid,
and you had to step on every line?

00:12:09.455 --> 00:12:12.976
Well, I was a grown man
who had all of these rituals,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.199
and it got so there was a throbbing,
there was a ferocious fear in my head.

00:12:17.223 --> 00:12:21.310
You've seen this painting
by Edvard Munch, "The Scream."

00:12:21.334 --> 00:12:24.703
Every moment was a scream;
it was impossible.

00:12:24.727 --> 00:12:27.748
So they decided there was no therapy,
there was no treatment.

00:12:27.772 --> 00:12:29.393
But there was one treatment,

00:12:29.417 --> 00:12:33.154
which actually had been pioneered
at the Hartford Hospital

00:12:33.178 --> 00:12:35.383
in the early 1940s,

00:12:35.407 --> 00:12:39.436
and you can imagine what it was:
it was prefrontal lobotomy.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.461
(Imitates a popping sound)

00:12:42.904 --> 00:12:46.333
So they decided -- I didn't know this,
again, I found this out later --

00:12:46.357 --> 00:12:48.185
that the only thing that could be done

00:12:48.209 --> 00:12:53.601
was for this 43-year-old man
to have a prefrontal lobotomy.

00:12:54.595 --> 00:12:56.517
Well, as in all hospitals,

00:12:56.541 --> 00:12:59.398
there was a resident assigned to my case.

00:12:59.422 --> 00:13:00.910
He was 27 years old,

00:13:00.934 --> 00:13:03.670
and he would meet with me
two or three times a week.

00:13:03.694 --> 00:13:07.114
And of course, I had been there, what,
three or four months at the time.

00:13:07.138 --> 00:13:10.614
He asked to meet with the senior staff,
and they agreed to meet with him,

00:13:10.638 --> 00:13:13.019
because he was very well
thought of in that place.

00:13:13.043 --> 00:13:15.541
They thought he had
a really extraordinary future.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.593
And he dug in his heels and said,

00:13:17.617 --> 00:13:19.736
"No. I know this man
better than any of you.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.697
I have met with him over and over again.

00:13:21.721 --> 00:13:25.320
You've just seen him from time to time.
You've read reports and so forth.

00:13:25.344 --> 00:13:29.759
I really honestly believe that the basic
problem here is pure depression,

00:13:29.783 --> 00:13:32.599
and all of the obsessional
thinking comes out of it.

00:13:33.057 --> 00:13:36.477
And you know, of course, what'll happen
if you do a prefrontal lobotomy.

00:13:36.501 --> 00:13:39.622
Any of the results along the spectrum,

00:13:39.646 --> 00:13:43.646
from pretty bad to terrible, terrible,
terrible, is going to happen.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.358
If he does the best he can,

00:13:46.382 --> 00:13:48.070
he will have no further obsessions,

00:13:48.094 --> 00:13:49.865
probably no depression,

00:13:49.889 --> 00:13:51.447
but his affect will be dulled,

00:13:51.471 --> 00:13:53.162
he will never go back to surgery,

00:13:53.186 --> 00:13:57.069
he will never be the loving father
that he was to his two children,

00:13:57.093 --> 00:13:58.299
his life will be changed.

00:13:58.323 --> 00:14:00.593
If he has the usual result,

00:14:00.617 --> 00:14:03.835
he'll end up like 'One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'

00:14:03.859 --> 00:14:07.976
And you know about that, just essentially
in a stupor the rest of his life."

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.241
"Well," he said, "can't we try
a course of electroshock therapy?"

00:14:13.265 --> 00:14:14.888
And you know why they agreed?

00:14:14.912 --> 00:14:16.640
They agreed to humor him.

00:14:16.664 --> 00:14:21.010
They just thought,
"Well, we'll give a course of 10.

00:14:21.034 --> 00:14:24.511
So we'll lose a little time. Big deal.
It doesn't make any difference."

00:14:25.177 --> 00:14:26.885
So they gave the course of 10,

00:14:26.909 --> 00:14:30.005
and the first -- the usual course,
incidentally, was six to eight,

00:14:30.029 --> 00:14:32.052
and still is six to eight --

00:14:32.076 --> 00:14:36.252
plugged me into the wires, put me
to sleep, gave me the muscle relaxant.

00:14:36.276 --> 00:14:39.230
Six didn't work. Seven didn't work.
Eight didn't work.

00:14:39.254 --> 00:14:42.095
At nine, I noticed --

00:14:42.119 --> 00:14:44.303
it's wonderful that I could
notice anything --

00:14:44.327 --> 00:14:45.618
I noticed a change.

00:14:45.642 --> 00:14:48.095
And at 10, I noticed a real change.

00:14:48.119 --> 00:14:49.322
And he went back to them,

00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:50.930
and they agreed to do another 10.

00:14:50.954 --> 00:14:52.889
Again, not a single one of them --

00:14:52.913 --> 00:14:55.248
I think there are about
seven or eight of them --

00:14:55.272 --> 00:14:56.752
thought this would do any good.

00:14:56.776 --> 00:14:58.740
They thought this was a temporary change.

00:14:58.764 --> 00:15:01.790
But, lo and behold, by 16, by 17,

00:15:01.814 --> 00:15:05.251
there were demonstrable
differences in the way I felt.

00:15:05.275 --> 00:15:07.976
By 18 and 19, I was sleeping
through the night.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.982
And by 20, I had the sense,
I really had the sense,

00:15:13.006 --> 00:15:14.699
that I could overcome this,

00:15:14.723 --> 00:15:18.005
that I was now strong enough
that by an act of will,

00:15:18.029 --> 00:15:20.338
I could blow the obsessional
thinking away.

00:15:20.362 --> 00:15:22.517
I could blow the depression away.

00:15:23.414 --> 00:15:25.760
And I've never forgotten --
I never will forget --

00:15:25.784 --> 00:15:29.054
standing in the kitchen of the unit --

00:15:29.078 --> 00:15:33.298
it was a Sunday morning
in January of 1974 --

00:15:33.322 --> 00:15:35.801
standing in the kitchen
by myself and thinking,

00:15:35.825 --> 00:15:38.924
"I've got the strength now to do this."

00:15:38.948 --> 00:15:44.077
It was as though those tightly coiled
wires in my head had been disconnected,

00:15:44.101 --> 00:15:45.976
and I could think clearly.

00:15:46.736 --> 00:15:47.986
But I need a formula.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.716
I need some thing to say to myself

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:55.192
when I begin thinking
obsessionally, obsessively.

00:15:55.811 --> 00:16:00.569
Well, the Gilbert and Sullivan
fans in this room

00:16:00.593 --> 00:16:02.003
will remember "Ruddigore,"

00:16:02.027 --> 00:16:03.748
and they will remember Mad Margaret,

00:16:03.772 --> 00:16:05.789
and they will remember
that she was married

00:16:05.813 --> 00:16:08.723
to a fella named Sir Despard Murgatroyd.

00:16:08.747 --> 00:16:12.735
And she used to go nuts
every five minutes or so in the play.

00:16:12.759 --> 00:16:16.518
And he said to her, "We must have a word
to bring you back to reality,

00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:19.396
and the word, my dear,
will be 'Basingstoke.'"

00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:23.713
So every time she got a little nuts,
he would say, "Basingstoke!"

00:16:23.737 --> 00:16:27.430
And she would say, "Basingstoke, it is!"
And she'd be fine for a little while.

00:16:27.454 --> 00:16:28.459
(Laughter)

00:16:28.483 --> 00:16:31.407
Well, you know, I'm from the Bronx.
I can't say "Basingstoke."

00:16:31.431 --> 00:16:32.444
(Laughter)

00:16:32.468 --> 00:16:33.887
But I had something better.

00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:35.978
And it was very simple.

00:16:36.461 --> 00:16:38.976
It was, "Ah, fuck it!"

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.846
(Laughter)

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:43.862
Much better than "Basingstoke,"

00:16:43.886 --> 00:16:45.781
at least for me.

00:16:45.805 --> 00:16:48.082
And it worked! My God, it worked.

00:16:48.106 --> 00:16:50.490
Every time I would begin
thinking obsessionally --

00:16:50.514 --> 00:16:54.361
again, once more,
after 20 shock treatments --

00:16:55.313 --> 00:16:57.471
I would say, "Ah, fuck it."

00:16:58.217 --> 00:17:00.730
And things got better and better,

00:17:00.754 --> 00:17:03.093
and within three or four months,

00:17:03.117 --> 00:17:04.943
I was discharged from that hospital.

00:17:04.967 --> 00:17:08.493
I joined a group of surgeons,
where I could work with other people,

00:17:09.608 --> 00:17:13.171
in a community, not in New Haven,
but fairly close by.

00:17:13.195 --> 00:17:15.099
I stayed there for three years.

00:17:15.123 --> 00:17:19.659
At the end of three years,
I went back to New Haven,

00:17:19.683 --> 00:17:22.376
had remarried by that time.

00:17:23.273 --> 00:17:27.866
I brought my wife with me, actually,
to make sure I could get through this.

00:17:29.446 --> 00:17:30.614
My children

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.182
came back

00:17:34.191 --> 00:17:35.343
to live with us.

00:17:35.367 --> 00:17:37.411
We had two more children after that.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.963
Resuscitated the career,

00:17:40.996 --> 00:17:43.520
even better than it had been before.

00:17:43.544 --> 00:17:45.973
Went right back into the university

00:17:47.404 --> 00:17:49.163
and began to write books.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.172
Well, you know,

00:17:51.971 --> 00:17:53.309
it's been a wonderful life.

00:17:53.333 --> 00:17:56.509
It's been, as I said, close to 30 years.

00:17:57.429 --> 00:18:00.604
I stopped doing surgery
about six years ago

00:18:00.628 --> 00:18:04.213
and became a full-time writer,
as many people know.

00:18:04.237 --> 00:18:06.614
But it's been very exciting.
It's been very happy.

00:18:06.638 --> 00:18:09.509
Every once in a while,
I have to say, "Ah, fuck it."

00:18:09.533 --> 00:18:13.005
Every once in a while, I get somewhat
depressed and a little obsessional.

00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:15.453
So, I'm not free of all of this.

00:18:17.692 --> 00:18:20.004
But it's worked. It's always worked.

00:18:21.698 --> 00:18:25.108
Why have I chosen,

00:18:25.132 --> 00:18:29.192
after never, ever talking about this,

00:18:29.216 --> 00:18:30.705
to talk about it now?

00:18:30.729 --> 00:18:33.631
Well, those of you who know
some of these books

00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:36.362
know that one is about death and dying,

00:18:36.386 --> 00:18:38.739
one is about the human body
and the human spirit,

00:18:38.763 --> 00:18:43.316
one is about the way mystical thoughts
are constantly in our minds.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:48.850
And they have always to do
with my own personal experiences.

00:18:48.874 --> 00:18:51.346
One might think reading these books --

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.629
and I've gotten thousands
of letters about them

00:18:53.653 --> 00:18:56.165
by people who do think this --

00:18:56.189 --> 00:18:59.790
that, based on my life's history
as I portray it in the books,

00:18:59.814 --> 00:19:01.058
my early life's history,

00:19:01.082 --> 00:19:04.803
I am someone who has overcome adversity,

00:19:04.827 --> 00:19:09.821
that I am someone who has
drunk -- drank? -- drunk

00:19:09.845 --> 00:19:16.388
of the bitter dregs
of near-disaster in childhood

00:19:16.412 --> 00:19:20.976
and emerged not just
unscathed but strengthened.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.685
I really have it figured out

00:19:22.709 --> 00:19:25.092
so that I can advise people
about death and dying,

00:19:25.116 --> 00:19:27.315
so that I can talk about mysticism

00:19:27.339 --> 00:19:28.702
and the human spirit.

00:19:28.726 --> 00:19:30.976
And I've always felt guilty about that.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.363
I've always felt that somehow
I was an impostor,

00:19:34.387 --> 00:19:39.179
because my readers don't know
what I have just told you.

00:19:39.203 --> 00:19:41.643
It's known by some people
in New Haven, obviously,

00:19:41.667 --> 00:19:43.898
but it is not generally known.

00:19:44.374 --> 00:19:50.614
So one of the reasons that I have
come here to talk about this today

00:19:50.638 --> 00:19:53.643
is to -- frankly, selfishly --

00:19:53.667 --> 00:19:57.783
unburden myself and let it be known

00:19:57.807 --> 00:20:03.064
that this is not an untroubled mind
that has written all of these books.

00:20:03.088 --> 00:20:04.956
But more importantly, I think,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.839
is the fact that a very significant
proportion of people in this audience

00:20:09.863 --> 00:20:11.089
are under 30,

00:20:12.177 --> 00:20:15.149
and there are many, of course,
who are well over 30.

00:20:17.706 --> 00:20:19.156
For people under 30,

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.409
and it looks to me like almost
all of you, I would say all of you,

00:20:22.433 --> 00:20:26.202
are either on the cusp
of a magnificent and exciting career

00:20:26.226 --> 00:20:30.562
or right into a magnificent
and exciting career:

00:20:31.564 --> 00:20:33.046
anything can happen to you.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:34.775
Things change.

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:36.366
Accidents happen.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:39.057
Something from childhood
comes back to haunt you.

00:20:39.081 --> 00:20:40.864
You can be thrown off the track.

00:20:40.888 --> 00:20:42.931
I hope it happens to none of you,

00:20:42.955 --> 00:20:46.472
but it will probably happen
to a small percentage of you.

00:20:47.068 --> 00:20:50.510
To those to whom it doesn't happen,
there will be adversities.

00:20:52.248 --> 00:20:57.194
If I, with the bleakness
of spirit -- with no spirit --

00:20:57.218 --> 00:21:00.319
that I had in the 1970s,

00:21:00.343 --> 00:21:03.038
and no possibility of recovery

00:21:03.062 --> 00:21:07.345
as far as that group of very experienced
psychiatrists thought,

00:21:07.369 --> 00:21:10.076
if I can find my way back from this,

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.433
believe me, anybody can
find their way back

00:21:13.457 --> 00:21:17.413
from any adversity
that exists in their lives.

00:21:17.437 --> 00:21:18.795
And for those who are older,

00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:22.387
who have lived through
perhaps not something as bad as this,

00:21:22.411 --> 00:21:24.779
but who have lived
through difficult times,

00:21:24.803 --> 00:21:27.143
perhaps where they lost
everything, as I did,

00:21:27.167 --> 00:21:29.014
and started out all over again:

00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:32.971
some of these things
will seem very familiar.

00:21:34.106 --> 00:21:37.512
There is recovery.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.882
There is redemption.

00:21:42.709 --> 00:21:45.495
And there is resurrection.

00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:48.761
There are resurrection themes

00:21:48.785 --> 00:21:51.534
in every society
that has ever been studied,

00:21:51.558 --> 00:21:54.533
and it is because
not just only do we fantasize

00:21:54.557 --> 00:21:57.428
about the possibility
of resurrection and recovery,

00:21:57.452 --> 00:21:59.272
but it actually happens.

00:21:59.296 --> 00:22:00.976
And it happens a lot.

00:22:01.538 --> 00:22:05.849
Perhaps the most popular
resurrection theme,

00:22:05.873 --> 00:22:08.659
outside of specifically religious ones,

00:22:08.683 --> 00:22:12.527
is the one about the phoenix,
the ancient story of the phoenix,

00:22:12.551 --> 00:22:15.059
who, every 500 years,

00:22:15.083 --> 00:22:18.800
resurrects itself from its own ashes

00:22:18.824 --> 00:22:21.596
to go on to live a life

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:25.207
that is even more beautiful
than it was before.

00:22:25.231 --> 00:22:26.484
Richard, thanks very much.
