00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:15.738
Architecture is amazing, for sure.

00:00:17.357 --> 00:00:19.761
It's amazing because it's art.

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:23.037
But you know, it's a very
funny kind of art.

00:00:23.061 --> 00:00:26.937
It's an art at the frontier
between art and science.

00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:29.509
It's fed by ...

00:00:31.053 --> 00:00:33.015
by real life, every day.

00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:36.376
It's driven by force of necessity.

00:00:37.313 --> 00:00:39.837
Quite amazing, quite amazing.

00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:43.480
And the life of the architect
is also amazing.

00:00:45.048 --> 00:00:48.175
You know, as an architect,
at 10 o’clock in the morning,

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.309
you need to be a poet, for sure.

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.741
But at 11,

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:56.371
you must become a humanist,

00:00:56.395 --> 00:00:58.751
otherwise you'd lose your direction.

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:04.210
And at noon, you absolutely
need to be a builder.

00:01:04.936 --> 00:01:08.467
You need to be able to make a building,

00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:13.382
because architecture, at the end,
is the art of making buildings.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.487
Architecture is the art of making
shelter for human beings.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.520
Period.

00:01:20.878 --> 00:01:22.745
And this is not easy at all.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.210
It's amazing.

00:01:25.038 --> 00:01:26.188
Look at this.

00:01:27.427 --> 00:01:29.482
Here we are in London,

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:34.115
at the top of the Shard of Glass.

00:01:35.309 --> 00:01:38.964
This is a building
we completed a few years ago.

00:01:38.988 --> 00:01:44.709
Those people are well-trained workers,

00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:49.963
and they are assembling
the top piece of the tower.

00:01:51.186 --> 00:01:56.050
Well, they look like rock climbers.

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:57.224
They are.

00:01:57.575 --> 00:02:00.210
I mean, they are defying
the force of gravity,

00:02:00.234 --> 00:02:02.434
like building does, by the way.

00:02:03.607 --> 00:02:05.924
We got 30 of those people --

00:02:05.948 --> 00:02:10.816
actually, on that site,
we got more than 1,400 people,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.502
coming from 60 different nationalities.

00:02:15.078 --> 00:02:18.093
You know, this is a miracle.
It's a miracle.

00:02:18.117 --> 00:02:21.370
To put together 1,400 people,

00:02:21.394 --> 00:02:24.474
coming from such different
places, is a miracle.

00:02:24.847 --> 00:02:26.596
Sites are miracles.

00:02:27.157 --> 00:02:28.423
This is another one.

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:30.795
Let's talk about construction.

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.736
Adventure, it's adventure in real life,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.712
not adventure in spirit.

00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:41.133
This guy there is a deepwater diver.

00:02:41.157 --> 00:02:45.244
From rock climbers to deepwater divers.

00:02:45.268 --> 00:02:47.029
This is in Berlin.

00:02:47.053 --> 00:02:49.966
After the fall of the Wall in '89,

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.093
we built this building, connecting
East Berlin to West Berlin,

00:02:54.117 --> 00:02:55.720
in Potsdamer Platz.

00:02:56.157 --> 00:03:01.177
We got on that project
almost 5,000 people.

00:03:02.065 --> 00:03:03.796
Almost 5,000 people.

00:03:04.606 --> 00:03:07.859
And this is another site in Japan,

00:03:08.701 --> 00:03:11.026
building the Kansai Airport.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.201
Again, all the rock climbers,
Japanese ones.

00:03:14.962 --> 00:03:17.803
You know, making buildings together

00:03:17.827 --> 00:03:22.030
is the best way to create
a sense of cooperation.

00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:25.231
The sense of pride -- pride is essential.

00:03:26.117 --> 00:03:29.505
But, you know, construction, of course,

00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:34.376
is one of the reasons
why architecture is amazing.

00:03:34.824 --> 00:03:39.023
But there is another one,
that is maybe even more amazing.

00:03:39.697 --> 00:03:42.315
Because architecture is the art

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:47.887
of making shelter for communities,

00:03:47.911 --> 00:03:49.693
not just for individuals --

00:03:50.038 --> 00:03:53.420
communities and society at large.

00:03:53.792 --> 00:03:55.792
And society is never the same.

00:03:56.792 --> 00:03:58.609
The world keeps changing.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.150
And changes are difficult
to swallow by people.

00:04:03.498 --> 00:04:07.650
And architecture is a mirror
of those changes.

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:13.612
Architecture is the built expression
of those changes.

00:04:14.347 --> 00:04:18.674
So, this is why it is so difficult,

00:04:19.411 --> 00:04:23.836
because those changes create adventure.

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:27.244
They create adventure,
and architecture is adventure.

00:04:27.268 --> 00:04:30.934
This is the Centre
Georges Pompidou in Paris,

00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.133
a long time ago.

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:35.777
That was back in time, '77.

00:04:36.623 --> 00:04:41.170
This was a spaceship
landing in the middle of Paris.

00:04:42.456 --> 00:04:47.329
Together with my friend
in adventure, Richard Rogers,

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:51.101
we were, at the time, young bad boys.

00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:52.329
Young, bad boys.

00:04:52.353 --> 00:04:53.388
(Laughter)

00:04:53.412 --> 00:04:58.178
It was really only
a few years after May '68.

00:04:58.863 --> 00:05:02.077
So it was a rebellion, pure rebellion.

00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:05.133
The idea was to make

00:05:05.688 --> 00:05:10.410
the proof that cultural buildings
should not be intimidating.

00:05:10.434 --> 00:05:14.006
They should create a sense of curiosity.

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:17.640
This is the way to create
a cultural place.

00:05:17.664 --> 00:05:21.523
Curiosity is the beginning
of a cultural attitude.

00:05:22.188 --> 00:05:25.722
And there's a piazza there,
you can see that piazza.

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:31.593
And a piazza is the beginning
of urban life.

00:05:31.617 --> 00:05:34.363
A piazza is the place where people meet.

00:05:34.387 --> 00:05:36.396
And they mix experience.

00:05:37.823 --> 00:05:39.455
And they mix ages.

00:05:40.815 --> 00:05:44.965
And, you know, in some way,

00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:49.709
you create the essence of the city.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:56.065
And since then, we made, in the office,
so many other places for people.

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:59.084
Here, in Rome, is a concert hall.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.005
Another place for people.

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:06.614
This building inside is actually
designed by the sound, you can see.

00:06:07.382 --> 00:06:09.148
It's flirting with sound.

00:06:09.854 --> 00:06:11.830
And this is the Kansai Airport,

00:06:12.489 --> 00:06:13.639
in Japan.

00:06:14.376 --> 00:06:17.215
To make a building, sometimes
you need to make an island,

00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:18.835
and we made the island.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.642
The building is more than one mile long.

00:06:23.442 --> 00:06:27.096
It looks like an immense glider,
landing on the ground.

00:06:27.942 --> 00:06:29.926
And this is in San Francisco.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.617
Another place for people.

00:06:31.918 --> 00:06:35.207
This building is the California
Academy of Sciences.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.585
And we planted on that roof --

00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:45.560
thousands and thousands of plants
that use the humidity of the air,

00:06:45.584 --> 00:06:48.948
instead of pumping water
from the water table.

00:06:49.266 --> 00:06:51.466
The roof is a living roof, actually.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.144
And this building was made Platinum LEED.

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:58.252
The LEED is the system
to measure, of course,

00:06:58.276 --> 00:07:00.689
the sustainability of a building.

00:07:01.022 --> 00:07:05.656
So this was also a place for people

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.085
that will stay a long time.

00:07:08.109 --> 00:07:10.006
And this is actually New York.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:12.410
This is the new Whitney,

00:07:12.434 --> 00:07:16.113
in the Meatpacking District in New York.

00:07:17.046 --> 00:07:20.011
Well, another flying vessel.

00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:22.775
Another place for people.

00:07:23.807 --> 00:07:26.696
Here we are in Athens,
the Niarchos Foundation.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.617
It's a library,

00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:32.331
it's an open house, a concert hall

00:07:32.355 --> 00:07:34.246
and a big park.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:39.320
This building is also
a Platinum LEED building.

00:07:40.286 --> 00:07:45.764
This building actually captures
the sun's energy with that roof.

00:07:47.014 --> 00:07:52.772
But, you know, making a building
a place for people is good.

00:07:53.188 --> 00:07:57.034
Making libraries, making concert halls,

00:07:57.058 --> 00:08:00.199
making universities,
making museums is good,

00:08:00.223 --> 00:08:04.383
because you create a place
that's open, accessible.

00:08:05.442 --> 00:08:08.484
You create a building
for a better world, for sure.

00:08:09.371 --> 00:08:13.842
But there is something else

00:08:13.866 --> 00:08:17.019
that makes architecture
amazing, even more.

00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:20.387
And this is the fact that

00:08:20.411 --> 00:08:26.235
architecture doesn't just answer
to need and necessity,

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:32.708
but also to desires -- yes, desires --
dreams, aspirations.

00:08:33.264 --> 00:08:35.151
This is what architecture does.

00:08:35.175 --> 00:08:40.709
Even the most modest hut on earth

00:08:40.733 --> 00:08:42.566
is not just a roof.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:43.811
It's more than a roof.

00:08:43.835 --> 00:08:45.236
It's telling a story;

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.766
it's telling a story about the identity
of the people living in that hut.

00:08:50.427 --> 00:08:51.577
Individuals.

00:08:52.109 --> 00:08:55.355
Architecture is the art
of telling stories.

00:08:56.212 --> 00:08:57.545
Like this one.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.918
In London: the Shard of Glass.

00:09:00.942 --> 00:09:05.635
Well, this building is the tallest
building in Western Europe.

00:09:06.013 --> 00:09:11.403
It goes up more than 300 meters
in the air, to breathe fresh air.

00:09:11.427 --> 00:09:15.172
The facets of this building are inclined,

00:09:15.196 --> 00:09:19.402
and they reflect the sky of London,
that is never the same.

00:09:19.426 --> 00:09:22.603
After rain, everything becomes bluish.

00:09:23.196 --> 00:09:26.433
In the sunny evening, everything is red.

00:09:27.577 --> 00:09:30.577
It's something
that is difficult to explain.

00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:34.096
It's what we call the soul of a building.

00:09:35.649 --> 00:09:38.813
On this picture on the left,
you have the Menil Collection,

00:09:38.837 --> 00:09:40.335
used a long time ago.

00:09:40.359 --> 00:09:41.830
It's a museum.

00:09:41.854 --> 00:09:44.497
On the right is the Harvard Art Museum.

00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:47.790
Both those two buildings flirt with light.

00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:53.990
Light is probably one of the most
essential materials in architecture.

00:09:54.789 --> 00:09:56.455
And this is in Amsterdam.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.636
This building is flirting with water.

00:10:01.162 --> 00:10:04.321
And this is my office, on the sea.

00:10:05.247 --> 00:10:08.115
Well, this is flirting with work.

00:10:08.572 --> 00:10:10.993
Actually, we enjoy working there.

00:10:11.017 --> 00:10:16.513
And that cable car is the little cable car
that goes up to there.

00:10:17.633 --> 00:10:20.300
That's "The New York Times" in New York.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.180
Well, this is playing with transparency.

00:10:24.204 --> 00:10:27.804
Again, the sense of light,
the sense of transparency.

00:10:29.363 --> 00:10:32.308
On the left here, you have
the Magic Lantern in Japan,

00:10:32.332 --> 00:10:34.355
in Ginza, in Tokyo.

00:10:35.153 --> 00:10:38.870
And in the center
is a monastery in the forest.

00:10:39.419 --> 00:10:43.908
This monastery is playing
with the silence and the forest.

00:10:44.855 --> 00:10:47.180
And a museum, a science museum.

00:10:47.831 --> 00:10:49.642
This is about levitation.

00:10:51.339 --> 00:10:54.791
And this is in the center of Paris,

00:10:54.815 --> 00:10:56.910
in the belly of the whale.

00:10:56.934 --> 00:10:59.546
This is the Pathé Foundation in Paris.

00:11:01.178 --> 00:11:04.105
All those buildings
have something in common:

00:11:04.129 --> 00:11:10.919
it's that something is searching
for desire, for dreams.

00:11:11.387 --> 00:11:12.537
And that's me.

00:11:12.561 --> 00:11:13.712
(Laughter)

00:11:13.736 --> 00:11:16.220
Well, it's me on my sailing boat.

00:11:17.855 --> 00:11:19.386
Flirting with breeze.

00:11:20.902 --> 00:11:25.857
Well, there's not a very good reason
to show you this picture.

00:11:25.881 --> 00:11:28.815
(Laughter)

00:11:28.839 --> 00:11:30.783
I'm trying, I'm trying.

00:11:30.807 --> 00:11:35.458
You know, one thing is clear:
I love sailing, for sure.

00:11:35.482 --> 00:11:38.549
I actually also love
designing sailing boats.

00:11:39.514 --> 00:11:43.971
But I love sailing, because sailing
is associated with slowness.

00:11:44.696 --> 00:11:45.974
And ...

00:11:46.887 --> 00:11:48.136
and silence.

00:11:48.934 --> 00:11:50.801
And the sense of suspension.

00:11:51.641 --> 00:11:54.410
And there is another thing
that this picture says.

00:11:54.831 --> 00:11:56.887
It says that I'm Italian.

00:11:56.911 --> 00:11:59.149
(Laughter)

00:11:59.173 --> 00:12:02.545
Well, there is very little
I can do about that.

00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:03.926
(Laughter)

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.109
I'm Italian, and I love beauty.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.870
I love beauty.

00:12:09.649 --> 00:12:13.918
Well, let's go sailing,
I want to take you sailing here,

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:15.237
to this place,

00:12:15.792 --> 00:12:18.446
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:23.696
This is the Jean-Marie Tjibaou Center.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.545
It's for the Kanaky ethnic group.

00:12:26.569 --> 00:12:28.924
It's in Nouméa, New Caledonia.

00:12:29.899 --> 00:12:31.979
This place is for art.

00:12:32.003 --> 00:12:33.425
Art and nature.

00:12:34.549 --> 00:12:39.034
And those buildings
actually flirt with the wind,

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:40.637
with the trade winds.

00:12:41.229 --> 00:12:44.570
They have a sound,
they have a voice, those buildings.

00:12:44.594 --> 00:12:47.538
I'm showing this
because it's about beauty.

00:12:47.848 --> 00:12:49.904
It's about pure beauty.

00:12:50.442 --> 00:12:53.529
And let's talk about beauty for a moment.

00:12:53.887 --> 00:12:57.323
Beauty is like the bird of paradise:

00:12:58.296 --> 00:13:02.006
the very moment you try
to catch it, it flies away.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.699
Your arm is too short.

00:13:06.236 --> 00:13:10.326
But beauty is not a frivolous idea.

00:13:11.149 --> 00:13:12.349
It's the opposite.

00:13:13.284 --> 00:13:15.919
In my native language, that is Italian,

00:13:15.943 --> 00:13:17.730
"beautiful" is "bello."

00:13:19.236 --> 00:13:23.570
In Spanish, "beauty" is "belleza."

00:13:24.809 --> 00:13:28.526
In Greek, "beautiful" is "kalos."

00:13:30.214 --> 00:13:35.167
When you add "agathos,"
that means "beautiful and good."

00:13:35.191 --> 00:13:39.977
In no one of those languages,
"beautiful" just means "beautiful."

00:13:40.001 --> 00:13:41.660
It also means "good."

00:13:43.295 --> 00:13:47.204
Real beauty is when the invisible

00:13:48.022 --> 00:13:51.983
joins the visible, coming on surface.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:56.996
And this doesn't apply
only to art or nature.

00:13:58.507 --> 00:14:03.881
This applies to science,
human curiosity, solidarity --

00:14:03.905 --> 00:14:07.275
that's the reason why you may say,

00:14:07.299 --> 00:14:10.585
"This is a beautiful person,"

00:14:10.609 --> 00:14:12.405
"That's a beautiful mind."

00:14:13.483 --> 00:14:17.690
This, this is the beauty
that can change people

00:14:17.714 --> 00:14:18.912
into better people,

00:14:18.936 --> 00:14:22.256
by switching a special light
in their eyes.

00:14:22.672 --> 00:14:25.387
And making buildings for this beauty

00:14:25.411 --> 00:14:28.093
makes cities better places to live.

00:14:28.863 --> 00:14:30.409
And better cities

00:14:31.196 --> 00:14:33.102
make better citizens.

00:14:34.244 --> 00:14:37.148
Well, this beauty --

00:14:37.172 --> 00:14:39.751
this universal beauty, I should say --

00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:44.480
is one of the few things
that can change the world.

00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:49.727
Believe me, this beauty
will save the world.

00:14:50.363 --> 00:14:53.561
One person at a time, but it will do it.

00:14:55.402 --> 00:14:56.632
Thank you.

00:14:56.656 --> 00:15:02.211
(Applause)
