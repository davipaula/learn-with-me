00:00:19.012 --> 00:00:21.814
Bacteria are the oldest
living organisms on the earth.

00:00:21.838 --> 00:00:23.859
They've been here for billions of years,

00:00:23.883 --> 00:00:27.836
and what they are are single-celled
microscopic organisms.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.156
So they're one cell

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.852
and they have this special property
that they only have one piece of DNA.

00:00:32.876 --> 00:00:35.804
So they have very few genes
and genetic information

00:00:35.828 --> 00:00:38.826
to encode all of the traits
that they carry out.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.227
And the way bacteria make a living
is that they consume nutrients

00:00:42.251 --> 00:00:43.411
from the environment,

00:00:43.435 --> 00:00:45.109
they grow to twice their size,

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:47.012
they cut themselves down in the middle,

00:00:47.036 --> 00:00:49.748
and one cell becomes two,
and so on and so on.

00:00:49.772 --> 00:00:53.664
They just grow and divide and grow
and divide -- so a kind of boring life,

00:00:53.688 --> 00:00:56.993
except that what I would argue
is that you have an amazing interaction

00:00:57.017 --> 00:00:58.251
with these critters.

00:00:58.275 --> 00:01:00.358
I know you guys think
of yourself as humans,

00:01:00.382 --> 00:01:02.273
and this is sort of how I think of you.

00:01:02.297 --> 00:01:05.534
This man is supposed to represent
a generic human being,

00:01:05.558 --> 00:01:09.716
and all of the circles in that man
are all the cells that make up your body.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.884
There's about a trillion human cells
that make each one of us who we are

00:01:13.908 --> 00:01:15.978
and able to do all the things that we do.

00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:19.343
But you have 10 trillion
bacterial cells in you or on you

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:20.668
at any moment in your life.

00:01:20.692 --> 00:01:25.306
So, 10 times more bacterial cells
than human cells on a human being.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.306
And, of course, it's the DNA that counts,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.740
so here's all the A, T, Gs and Cs
that make up your genetic code

00:01:30.764 --> 00:01:32.980
and give you all
your charming characteristics.

00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:34.670
You have about 30,000 genes.

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:38.024
Well, it turns out you have
100 times more bacterial genes

00:01:38.048 --> 00:01:41.590
playing a role in you
or on you all of your life.

00:01:41.614 --> 00:01:46.454
So at the best, you're 10 percent human;
more likely, about one percent human,

00:01:46.478 --> 00:01:48.886
depending on which
of these metrics you like.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.031
I know you think of yourself
as human beings,

00:01:51.055 --> 00:01:54.306
but I think of you as
90 or 99 percent bacterial.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.543
(Laughter)

00:01:55.567 --> 00:01:58.534
And these bacteria are not passive riders.

00:01:58.558 --> 00:02:01.804
These are incredibly important;
they keep us alive.

00:02:01.828 --> 00:02:04.445
They cover us in an invisible body armor

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.306
that keeps environmental insults out
so that we stay healthy.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.809
They digest our food,
they make our vitamins,

00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:15.031
they actually educate your immune system
to keep bad microbes out.

00:02:15.055 --> 00:02:17.056
So they do all these amazing things

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.696
that help us and are vital
for keeping us alive,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.830
and they never get any press for that.

00:02:22.854 --> 00:02:27.056
But they get a lot of press because
they do a lot of terrible things as well.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.488
So there's all kinds
of bacteria on the earth

00:02:29.512 --> 00:02:32.987
that have no business being
in you or on you at any time,

00:02:33.011 --> 00:02:36.571
and if they are,
they make you incredibly sick.

00:02:36.595 --> 00:02:38.048
And so the question for my lab

00:02:38.072 --> 00:02:41.498
is whether you want to think about
all the good things that bacteria do

00:02:41.522 --> 00:02:43.449
or all the bad things that bacteria do.

00:02:43.473 --> 00:02:46.207
The question we had is:
How could they do anything at all?

00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:47.829
I mean, they're incredibly small.

00:02:47.853 --> 00:02:49.834
You have to have a microscope to see one.

00:02:49.858 --> 00:02:52.897
They live this sort of boring life
where they grow and divide,

00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:57.645
and they've always been considered
to be these asocial, reclusive organisms.

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:00.192
And so it seemed to us
that they're just too small

00:03:00.216 --> 00:03:02.172
to have an impact on the environment

00:03:02.196 --> 00:03:04.770
if they simply act as individuals.

00:03:04.794 --> 00:03:09.063
So we wanted to think if there couldn't be
a different way that bacteria live.

00:03:09.087 --> 00:03:12.871
And the clue to this came
from another marine bacterium,

00:03:12.895 --> 00:03:15.323
and it's a bacterium
called "Vibrio fischeri."

00:03:15.347 --> 00:03:18.899
What you're looking at on this slide
is just a person from my lab

00:03:18.923 --> 00:03:22.056
holding a flask of a liquid
culture of a bacterium,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.253
a harmless, beautiful bacterium
that comes from the ocean,

00:03:25.277 --> 00:03:26.706
named Vibrio fischeri.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.056
And this bacterium has the special
property that it makes light,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.473
so it makes bioluminescence,

00:03:31.497 --> 00:03:33.321
like fireflies make light.

00:03:33.345 --> 00:03:35.380
We're not doing anything
to the cells here,

00:03:35.404 --> 00:03:38.394
we just took the picture
by turning the lights off in the room,

00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:39.842
and this is what we see.

00:03:39.866 --> 00:03:43.589
And what's actually interesting to us
was not that the bacteria made light

00:03:43.613 --> 00:03:45.770
but when the bacteria made light.

00:03:45.794 --> 00:03:48.493
What we noticed
is when the bacteria were alone,

00:03:48.517 --> 00:03:50.672
so when they were in dilute suspension,

00:03:50.696 --> 00:03:52.056
they made no light.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.128
But when they grew
to a certain cell number,

00:03:54.152 --> 00:03:57.502
all the bacteria turned on light
simultaneously.

00:03:57.526 --> 00:03:59.254
So the question that we had is:

00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:01.992
How can bacteria,
these primitive organisms,

00:04:02.016 --> 00:04:04.344
tell the difference
from times when they're alone

00:04:04.368 --> 00:04:06.259
and times when they're in a community,

00:04:06.283 --> 00:04:08.410
and then all do something together?

00:04:09.024 --> 00:04:13.125
And what we figured out is that the way
they do that is they talk to each other,

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:15.319
and they talk with a chemical language.

00:04:15.343 --> 00:04:18.056
So this is now supposed
to be my bacterial cell.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.578
When it's alone,
it doesn't make any light.

00:04:20.602 --> 00:04:24.356
But what it does do is to make
and secrete small molecules

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.258
that you can think of like hormones,

00:04:26.282 --> 00:04:27.981
and these are the red triangles.

00:04:28.005 --> 00:04:31.606
And when the bacteria are alone,
the molecules just float away,

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.950
and so, no light.

00:04:32.974 --> 00:04:34.916
But when the bacteria grow and double

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.277
and they're all participating
in making these molecules,

00:04:38.301 --> 00:04:41.785
the molecule, the extracellular
amount of that molecule,

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:44.636
increases in proportion to cell number.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.945
And when the molecule
hits a certain amount

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:49.509
that tells the bacteria
how many neighbors there are,

00:04:49.533 --> 00:04:51.027
they recognize that molecule

00:04:51.051 --> 00:04:54.658
and all of the bacteria
turn on light in synchrony.

00:04:54.682 --> 00:04:56.966
And so that's how bioluminescence works --

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.136
they're talking with these chemical words.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.630
The reason Vibrio fischeri is doing that
comes from the biology --

00:05:02.654 --> 00:05:06.056
again, another plug
for the animals in the ocean.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.356
Vibrio fischeri lives in this squid.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.056
What you're looking at
is the Hawaiian bobtail squid.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.724
It's been turned on its back,

00:05:12.748 --> 00:05:15.947
and what I hope you can see
are these two glowing lobes.

00:05:15.971 --> 00:05:18.240
These house the Vibrio fischeri cells.

00:05:18.264 --> 00:05:20.268
They live in there, at high cell number.

00:05:20.292 --> 00:05:23.255
That molecule is there,
and they're making light.

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:26.540
And the reason the squid is willing
to put up with these shenanigans

00:05:26.564 --> 00:05:28.054
is because it wants that light.

00:05:28.078 --> 00:05:30.056
The way that this symbiosis works

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.479
is that this little squid lives
just off the coast of Hawaii,

00:05:33.503 --> 00:05:35.830
just in sort of shallow knee-deep water.

00:05:35.854 --> 00:05:37.381
And the squid is nocturnal,

00:05:37.405 --> 00:05:41.056
so during the day, it buries itself
in the sand and sleeps.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.397
But then at night,
it has to come out to hunt.

00:05:43.421 --> 00:05:44.665
So on bright nights

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:46.792
when there's lots
of starlight or moonlight,

00:05:46.816 --> 00:05:50.013
that light can penetrate the depth
of the water the squid lives in,

00:05:50.037 --> 00:05:52.181
since it's just in those
couple feet of water.

00:05:52.205 --> 00:05:55.933
What the squid has developed is a shutter
that can open and close

00:05:55.957 --> 00:05:59.056
over the specialized light organ
housing the bacteria.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.056
And then it has detectors on its back

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.574
so it can sense how much starlight
or moonlight is hitting its back.

00:06:04.598 --> 00:06:06.411
And it opens and closes the shutter

00:06:06.435 --> 00:06:08.702
so the amount of light
coming out of the bottom,

00:06:08.726 --> 00:06:10.249
which is made by the bacterium,

00:06:10.273 --> 00:06:12.941
exactly matches how much light
hits the squid's back,

00:06:12.965 --> 00:06:14.923
so the squid doesn't make a shadow.

00:06:14.947 --> 00:06:17.491
So it actually uses the light
from the bacteria

00:06:17.515 --> 00:06:21.036
to counter-illuminate itself
in an antipredation device,

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.056
so predators can't see its shadow,

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.056
calculate its trajectory and eat it.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.682
So this is like the stealth
bomber of the ocean.

00:06:27.706 --> 00:06:28.880
(Laughter)

00:06:28.904 --> 00:06:32.161
But then if you think about it,
this squid has this terrible problem,

00:06:32.185 --> 00:06:34.898
because it's got this dying,
thick culture of bacteria,

00:06:34.922 --> 00:06:36.377
and it can't sustain that.

00:06:36.401 --> 00:06:39.296
And so what happens is,
every morning when the sun comes up,

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.156
the squid goes back to sleep,
it buries itself in the sand,

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.010
and it's got a pump that's attached
to its circadian rhythm.

00:06:45.034 --> 00:06:49.625
And when the sun comes up, it pumps out,
like, 95 percent of the bacteria.

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:51.301
So now the bacteria are dilute,

00:06:51.325 --> 00:06:54.477
that little hormone molecule is gone,
so they're not making light.

00:06:54.501 --> 00:06:57.534
But, of course, the squid doesn't care,
it's asleep in the sand.

00:06:57.558 --> 00:06:59.612
And as the day goes by,
the bacteria double,

00:06:59.636 --> 00:07:02.461
they release the molecule,
and then light comes on at night,

00:07:02.485 --> 00:07:04.594
exactly when the squid wants it.

00:07:04.618 --> 00:07:07.965
So first, we figured out
how this bacterium does this,

00:07:07.989 --> 00:07:10.735
but then we brought the tools
of molecular biology to this

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:12.911
to figure out, really,
what's the mechanism.

00:07:12.935 --> 00:07:16.959
And what we found -- so this is now
supposed to be my bacterial cell --

00:07:16.983 --> 00:07:18.904
is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein.

00:07:18.928 --> 00:07:20.117
That's the red box --

00:07:20.141 --> 00:07:23.115
it's an enzyme that makes
that little hormone molecule,

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:24.306
the red triangle.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:25.640
And then as the cells grow,

00:07:25.664 --> 00:07:28.370
they're all releasing that molecule
into the environment,

00:07:28.394 --> 00:07:30.056
so there's lots of molecule there.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.961
And the bacteria also have
a receptor on their cell surface

00:07:33.985 --> 00:07:36.514
that fits like a lock and key
with that molecule.

00:07:36.538 --> 00:07:40.128
These are just like the receptors
on the surfaces of your cells.

00:07:40.152 --> 00:07:42.575
So when the molecule increases
to a certain amount,

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:44.846
which says something
about the number of cells,

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:46.619
it locks down into that receptor

00:07:46.643 --> 00:07:49.020
and information comes into the cells

00:07:49.044 --> 00:07:53.903
that tells the cells to turn on
this collective behavior of making light.

00:07:53.927 --> 00:07:56.623
Why this is interesting
is because in the past decade,

00:07:56.647 --> 00:07:58.890
we have found that this
is not just some anomaly

00:07:58.914 --> 00:08:02.381
of this ridiculous, glow-in-the-dark
bacterium that lives in the ocean --

00:08:02.405 --> 00:08:04.262
all bacteria have systems like this.

00:08:04.286 --> 00:08:07.919
So now what we understand is that all
bacteria can talk to each other.

00:08:07.943 --> 00:08:10.745
They make chemical words,
they recognize those words,

00:08:10.769 --> 00:08:12.775
and they turn on group behaviors

00:08:12.799 --> 00:08:17.397
that are only successful when
all of the cells participate in unison.

00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:20.833
So now we have a fancy name for this:
we call it "quorum sensing."

00:08:20.857 --> 00:08:22.873
They vote with these chemical votes,

00:08:22.897 --> 00:08:26.841
the vote gets counted,
and then everybody responds to the vote.

00:08:26.865 --> 00:08:30.701
What's important for today's talk
is we know there are hundreds of behaviors

00:08:30.725 --> 00:08:33.653
that bacteria carry out
in these collective fashions.

00:08:33.677 --> 00:08:37.180
But the one that's probably
the most important to you is virulence.

00:08:37.204 --> 00:08:41.451
It's not like a couple bacteria get in you
and start secreting some toxins --

00:08:41.475 --> 00:08:45.207
you're enormous; that would have
no effect on you, you're huge.

00:08:45.231 --> 00:08:47.370
But what they do, we now understand,

00:08:47.394 --> 00:08:50.356
is they get in you, they wait,
they start growing,

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.752
they count themselves
with these little molecules,

00:08:52.776 --> 00:08:55.411
and they recognize when they have
the right cell number

00:08:55.435 --> 00:08:58.656
that if all of the bacteria launch
their virulence attack together,

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.356
they're going to be successful
at overcoming an enormous host.

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:07.216
So bacteria always control
pathogenicity with quorum sensing.

00:09:07.732 --> 00:09:09.056
So that's how it works.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.729
We also then went to look
at what are these molecules.

00:09:11.753 --> 00:09:14.337
These were the red triangles
on my slides before.

00:09:14.361 --> 00:09:16.653
This is the Vibrio fischeri molecule.

00:09:16.677 --> 00:09:18.435
This is the word that it talks with.

00:09:18.459 --> 00:09:20.607
And then we started
to look at other bacteria,

00:09:20.631 --> 00:09:24.037
and these are just a smattering
of the molecules that we've discovered.

00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:27.301
What I hope you can see
is that the molecules are related.

00:09:27.325 --> 00:09:29.769
The left-hand part
of the molecule is identical

00:09:29.793 --> 00:09:32.396
in every single species of bacteria.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.506
But the right-hand part of the molecule
is a little bit different

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:37.016
in every single species.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:42.539
What that does is to confer exquisite
species specificities to these languages.

00:09:42.563 --> 00:09:45.805
So each molecule
fits into its partner receptor

00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:46.986
and no other.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.868
So these are private,
secret conversations.

00:09:49.892 --> 00:09:53.707
These conversations
are for intraspecies communication.

00:09:53.731 --> 00:09:57.923
Each bacteria uses a particular
molecule that's its language

00:09:57.947 --> 00:10:01.157
that allows it to count its own siblings.

00:10:02.189 --> 00:10:03.409
Once we got that far,

00:10:03.433 --> 00:10:07.405
we thought we were starting to understand
that bacteria have these social behaviors.

00:10:07.429 --> 00:10:10.484
But what we were really thinking
about is that most of the time,

00:10:10.508 --> 00:10:13.759
bacteria don't live by themselves,
they live in incredible mixtures,

00:10:13.783 --> 00:10:16.588
with hundreds or thousands
of other species of bacteria.

00:10:16.612 --> 00:10:18.321
And that's depicted on this slide.

00:10:18.345 --> 00:10:19.501
This is your skin.

00:10:19.525 --> 00:10:22.543
So this is just a picture --
a micrograph of your skin.

00:10:22.567 --> 00:10:25.131
Anywhere on your body,
it looks pretty much like this.

00:10:25.155 --> 00:10:26.397
What I hope you can see

00:10:26.421 --> 00:10:28.536
is that there's all kinds
of bacteria there.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.687
And so we started to think, if this
really is about communication in bacteria,

00:10:32.711 --> 00:10:34.631
and it's about counting your neighbors,

00:10:34.655 --> 00:10:38.273
it's not enough to be able
to only talk within your species.

00:10:38.297 --> 00:10:40.501
There has to be a way to take a census

00:10:40.525 --> 00:10:42.981
of the rest of the bacteria
in the population.

00:10:43.005 --> 00:10:45.056
So we went back to molecular biology

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.029
and started studying different bacteria.

00:10:47.053 --> 00:10:51.056
And what we've found now is that,
in fact, bacteria are multilingual.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.056
They all have a species-specific system,

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.902
they have a molecule that says "me."

00:10:55.926 --> 00:10:58.696
But then running in parallel
to that is a second system

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.791
that we've discovered, that's generic.

00:11:00.815 --> 00:11:03.876
So they have a second enzyme
that makes a second signal,

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.579
and it has its own receptor,

00:11:05.603 --> 00:11:09.056
and this molecule
is the trade language of bacteria.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.056
It's used by all different bacteria,

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.523
and it's the language
of interspecies communication.

00:11:14.547 --> 00:11:18.056
What happens is that bacteria
are able to count

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.178
how many of "me" and how many of "you."

00:11:20.202 --> 00:11:22.270
And they take that information inside,

00:11:22.294 --> 00:11:25.056
and they decide what tasks to carry out

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.099
depending on who's in the minority
and who's in the majority

00:11:28.123 --> 00:11:30.067
of any given population.

00:11:30.853 --> 00:11:32.958
Then, again, we turned to chemistry,

00:11:32.982 --> 00:11:35.461
and we figured out
what this generic molecule is --

00:11:35.485 --> 00:11:38.637
that was the pink ovals
on my last slide, this is it.

00:11:38.661 --> 00:11:41.389
It's a very small, five-carbon molecule.

00:11:41.413 --> 00:11:43.673
And what the important thing
is that we learned

00:11:43.697 --> 00:11:46.506
is that every bacterium
has exactly the same enzyme

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.717
and makes exactly the same molecule.

00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:52.531
So they're all using this molecule
for interspecies communication.

00:11:52.555 --> 00:11:55.235
This is the bacterial Esperanto.

00:11:55.259 --> 00:11:56.682
(Laughter)

00:11:56.706 --> 00:11:58.090
So once we got that far,

00:11:58.114 --> 00:12:00.748
we started to learn that bacteria
can talk to each other

00:12:00.772 --> 00:12:02.122
with this chemical language.

00:12:02.146 --> 00:12:03.296
But we started to think

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.674
that maybe there is something practical
that we can do here as well.

00:12:06.698 --> 00:12:09.555
I've told you that bacteria
have all these social behaviors,

00:12:09.579 --> 00:12:11.641
that they communicate
with these molecules.

00:12:11.665 --> 00:12:14.996
Of course, I've also told you
that one of the important things they do

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:18.056
is to initiate pathogenicity
using quorum sensing.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.233
So we thought:

00:12:19.257 --> 00:12:22.985
What if we made these bacteria
so they can't talk or they can't hear?

00:12:23.009 --> 00:12:25.658
Couldn't these be
new kinds of antibiotics?

00:12:25.682 --> 00:12:28.159
And of course, you've just heard
and you already know

00:12:28.183 --> 00:12:30.032
that we're running out of antibiotics.

00:12:30.056 --> 00:12:32.764
Bacteria are incredibly
multi-drug-resistant right now,

00:12:32.788 --> 00:12:36.765
and that's because all of the antibiotics
that we use kill bacteria.

00:12:36.789 --> 00:12:38.899
They either pop the bacterial membrane,

00:12:38.923 --> 00:12:41.826
they make the bacterium
so it can't replicate its DNA.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.244
We kill bacteria
with traditional antibiotics,

00:12:44.268 --> 00:12:46.794
and that selects for resistant mutants.

00:12:46.818 --> 00:12:49.567
And so now, of course,
we have this global problem

00:12:49.591 --> 00:12:51.249
in infectious diseases.

00:12:51.273 --> 00:12:54.645
So we thought, what if we could
sort of do behavior modifications,

00:12:54.669 --> 00:12:58.057
just make these bacteria
so they can't talk, they can't count,

00:12:58.081 --> 00:13:00.482
and they don't know to launch virulence?

00:13:00.506 --> 00:13:02.187
So that's exactly what we've done,

00:13:02.211 --> 00:13:04.119
and we've sort of taken two strategies.

00:13:04.143 --> 00:13:08.332
The first one is, we've targeted
the intraspecies communication system.

00:13:08.356 --> 00:13:12.581
So we made molecules that look kind
of like the real molecules, which you saw,

00:13:12.605 --> 00:13:14.315
but they're a little bit different.

00:13:14.339 --> 00:13:16.194
And so they lock into those receptors,

00:13:16.218 --> 00:13:18.964
and they jam recognition
of the real thing.

00:13:18.988 --> 00:13:20.917
So by targeting the red system,

00:13:20.941 --> 00:13:25.887
what we are able to do is make
species-specific, or disease-specific,

00:13:25.911 --> 00:13:27.746
anti-quorum-sensing molecules.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:30.359
We've also done the same thing
with the pink system.

00:13:30.383 --> 00:13:33.813
We've taken that universal molecule
and turned it around a little bit

00:13:33.837 --> 00:13:38.056
so that we've made antagonists
of the interspecies communication system.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.307
The hope is that these will be used
as broad-spectrum antibiotics

00:13:42.331 --> 00:13:44.297
that work against all bacteria.

00:13:44.321 --> 00:13:47.081
And so to finish,
I'll show you the strategy.

00:13:47.105 --> 00:13:49.767
In this one, I'm just using
the interspecies molecule,

00:13:49.791 --> 00:13:51.910
but the logic is exactly the same.

00:13:51.934 --> 00:13:55.187
So what you know is that when
that bacterium gets into the animal --

00:13:55.211 --> 00:13:56.380
in this case, a mouse --

00:13:56.404 --> 00:13:58.799
it doesn't initiate virulence right away.

00:13:58.823 --> 00:14:00.538
It gets in, it starts growing,

00:14:00.562 --> 00:14:03.408
it starts secreting
its quorum-sensing molecules.

00:14:03.432 --> 00:14:05.806
It recognizes when it has enough bacteria

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.994
that now they're going
to launch their attack,

00:14:08.018 --> 00:14:09.321
and the animal dies.

00:14:09.345 --> 00:14:12.888
And so what we've been able to do
is to give these virulent infections,

00:14:12.912 --> 00:14:16.755
but we give them in conjunction
with our anti-quorum-sensing molecules.

00:14:16.779 --> 00:14:19.637
So these are molecules that look
kind of like the real thing,

00:14:19.661 --> 00:14:22.774
but they're a little different,
which I've depicted on this slide.

00:14:22.798 --> 00:14:26.523
What we now know is that if we treat
the animal with a pathogenic bacterium --

00:14:26.547 --> 00:14:28.824
a multi-drug-resistant
pathogenic bacterium --

00:14:28.848 --> 00:14:32.872
in the same time we give
our anti-quorum-sensing molecule,

00:14:32.896 --> 00:14:34.775
in fact, the animal lives.

00:14:34.799 --> 00:14:38.027
And so we think that this
is the next generation of antibiotics,

00:14:38.051 --> 00:14:40.540
and it's going to get us
around, at least initially,

00:14:40.564 --> 00:14:42.738
this big problem of resistance.

00:14:42.762 --> 00:14:45.995
What I hope you think is that bacteria
can talk to each other,

00:14:46.019 --> 00:14:48.169
they use chemicals as their words,

00:14:48.193 --> 00:14:51.279
they have an incredibly
complicated chemical lexicon

00:14:51.303 --> 00:14:54.036
that we're just now
starting to learn about.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:58.888
Of course, what that allows bacteria to do
is to be multicellular.

00:14:58.912 --> 00:15:00.717
So in the spirit of TED,

00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:04.617
they're doing things together
because it makes a difference.

00:15:04.641 --> 00:15:07.923
What happens is that bacteria
have these collective behaviors,

00:15:07.947 --> 00:15:09.736
and they can carry out tasks

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.920
that they could never accomplish
if they simply acted as individuals.

00:15:13.944 --> 00:15:17.145
What I would hope that I could
further argue to you

00:15:17.169 --> 00:15:19.769
is that this is the invention
of multicellularity.

00:15:19.793 --> 00:15:23.393
Bacteria have been on the earth
for billions of years;

00:15:23.417 --> 00:15:25.460
humans, couple hundred thousand.

00:15:25.484 --> 00:15:30.993
So we think bacteria made the rules
for how multicellular organization works.

00:15:31.017 --> 00:15:33.410
And we think by studying bacteria,

00:15:33.434 --> 00:15:37.551
we're going to be able to have insight
about multicellularity in the human body.

00:15:37.575 --> 00:15:39.723
So we know that the principles
and the rules,

00:15:39.747 --> 00:15:42.769
if we can figure them out
in these sort of primitive organisms,

00:15:42.793 --> 00:15:44.585
the hope is that they will be applied

00:15:44.609 --> 00:15:47.413
to other human diseases
and human behaviors as well.

00:15:48.245 --> 00:15:49.771
I hope that what you've learned

00:15:49.795 --> 00:15:52.142
is that bacteria can distinguish
self from other.

00:15:52.166 --> 00:15:53.696
So by using these two molecules,

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.979
they can say "me" and they can say "you."

00:15:56.003 --> 00:15:57.980
And again, of course, that's what we do,

00:15:58.004 --> 00:16:01.466
both in a molecular way,
and also in an outward way,

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.419
but I think about the molecular stuff.

00:16:03.443 --> 00:16:05.461
This is exactly what happens in your body.

00:16:05.485 --> 00:16:09.080
It's not like your heart cells and kidney
cells get all mixed up every day,

00:16:09.104 --> 00:16:11.855
and that's because there's all
of this chemistry going on,

00:16:11.879 --> 00:16:15.056
these molecules that say
who each of these groups of cells is

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.954
and what their tasks should be.

00:16:16.978 --> 00:16:20.056
So again, we think bacteria invented that,

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.615
and you've just evolved
a few more bells and whistles,

00:16:22.639 --> 00:16:26.960
but all of the ideas are in these simple
systems that we can study.

00:16:26.984 --> 00:16:30.684
And the final thing is, just to reiterate
that there's this practical part,

00:16:30.708 --> 00:16:33.746
and so we've made these
anti-quorum-sensing molecules

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.356
that are being developed
as new kinds of therapeutics.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.850
But then, to finish with a plug
for all the good and miraculous bacteria

00:16:39.874 --> 00:16:41.398
that live on the earth,

00:16:41.422 --> 00:16:43.961
we've also made
pro-quorum-sensing molecules.

00:16:43.985 --> 00:16:47.216
So we've targeted those systems
to make the molecules work better.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.745
So remember, you have
these 10 times or more bacterial cells

00:16:50.769 --> 00:16:52.817
in you or on you, keeping you healthy.

00:16:52.841 --> 00:16:56.144
What we're also trying to do
is to beef up the conversation

00:16:56.168 --> 00:16:58.904
of the bacteria that live
as mutualists with you,

00:16:58.928 --> 00:17:00.976
in the hopes of making you more healthy,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.741
making those conversations better,

00:17:02.765 --> 00:17:05.650
so bacteria can do things
that we want them to do

00:17:05.674 --> 00:17:08.449
better than they would be on their own.

00:17:08.897 --> 00:17:10.968
Finally, I wanted to show you --

00:17:10.992 --> 00:17:13.176
this is my gang at Princeton, New Jersey.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.041
Everything I told you about
was discovered by someone in that picture.

00:17:17.065 --> 00:17:20.609
And I hope when you learn things,
like about how the natural world works --

00:17:20.633 --> 00:17:23.844
I just want to say that whenever you
read something in the newspaper

00:17:23.868 --> 00:17:27.238
or you hear some talk about something
ridiculous in the natural world,

00:17:27.262 --> 00:17:28.761
it was done by a child.

00:17:28.785 --> 00:17:31.099
So science is done by that demographic.

00:17:31.123 --> 00:17:34.496
All of those people
are between 20 and 30 years old,

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:39.057
and they are the engine that drives
scientific discovery in this country.

00:17:39.081 --> 00:17:41.436
And it's a really lucky
demographic to work with.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.462
(Applause)

00:17:42.486 --> 00:17:45.488
I keep getting older and older,
and they're always the same age.

00:17:45.512 --> 00:17:47.682
And it's just a crazy, delightful job.

00:17:47.706 --> 00:17:49.901
And I want to thank you
for inviting me here,

00:17:49.925 --> 00:17:52.944
it's a big treat for me to get to come
to this conference.

00:17:52.968 --> 00:17:55.228
(Applause)

00:17:57.724 --> 00:17:58.922
Thanks.

00:17:58.946 --> 00:18:01.846
(Applause)
