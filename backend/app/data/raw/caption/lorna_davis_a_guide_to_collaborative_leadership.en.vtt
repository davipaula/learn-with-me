00:00:13.627 --> 00:00:17.659
It was a fantastic new pink suit

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:20.515
with big buttons and shoulder pads.

00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:23.387
It was 1997,

00:00:23.411 --> 00:00:26.021
and I was the new boss of Griffin's Foods,

00:00:26.045 --> 00:00:29.225
an iconic cookie and snacks
company in New Zealand.

00:00:30.148 --> 00:00:32.839
It was my first time
as the leader of a company,

00:00:32.863 --> 00:00:35.403
and I was on the stage
to give a big speech

00:00:35.427 --> 00:00:37.427
about our ambitious new goals.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.314
I knew exactly what my call to action was,

00:00:41.338 --> 00:00:44.806
which was "One in every four times
a Kiwi eats a snack,

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.363
it will be one of ours."

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.315
I emphasized that we knew
how to measure our results

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.352
and that our future was in our control.

00:00:54.448 --> 00:00:55.655
Embarrassingly enough,

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:58.392
I finished up with "If not this, what?

00:00:58.416 --> 00:00:59.630
If not us, who?

00:00:59.654 --> 00:01:01.588
And if not now, when?"

00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:04.859
I got this huge round of applause

00:01:04.883 --> 00:01:07.950
and I was really,
really pleased with myself.

00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:11.746
I wanted so much to be a good leader.

00:01:12.474 --> 00:01:15.569
I wanted to be followed by a devoted team,

00:01:15.593 --> 00:01:16.993
I wanted to be right.

00:01:17.823 --> 00:01:20.523
In short, I wanted to be a hero.

00:01:21.165 --> 00:01:25.101
A hero selling chips
and biscuits in a pink suit.

00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:27.323
(Laughter)

00:01:28.403 --> 00:01:30.536
What happened after that speech?

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:32.569
Nothing.

00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:36.451
All of that applause
did not lead to action.

00:01:36.475 --> 00:01:37.625
Nothing changed.

00:01:38.021 --> 00:01:40.973
Not because they didn't like
me or the message.

00:01:40.997 --> 00:01:44.537
The problem was that no one knew
what they were expected to do.

00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:45.965
And most importantly,

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:48.389
they didn't know that I needed them.

00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:51.672
Now, you may think
that this is a classic hero speech,

00:01:51.696 --> 00:01:55.258
where I'm going to tell you that
I overcame that obstacle and triumphed.

00:01:55.736 --> 00:01:58.053
Actually, I'm going to tell you

00:01:58.077 --> 00:02:00.647
that in a world as complex
and interconnected

00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:02.282
as the one we live in,

00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:06.020
the idea that one person
has the answer is ludicrous.

00:02:06.624 --> 00:02:10.060
It's not only ineffective, it's dangerous,

00:02:10.084 --> 00:02:14.164
because it leads us to believe
that it's been solved by that hero,

00:02:14.188 --> 00:02:16.045
and we have no role.

00:02:17.323 --> 00:02:18.863
We don't need heroes.

00:02:18.887 --> 00:02:21.339
We need radical interdependence,

00:02:21.363 --> 00:02:24.225
which is just another way
of saying we need each other.

00:02:24.792 --> 00:02:28.024
Even though other people
can be really difficult, sometimes.

00:02:30.334 --> 00:02:33.929
I spent decades trying to work out
how to be a good leader.

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:36.794
I've lived in seven countries
and five continents.

00:02:37.458 --> 00:02:38.783
And in recent years,

00:02:38.807 --> 00:02:41.736
I've spent a lot of time
with the B Corp community,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.823
originally as a corporate participant

00:02:43.847 --> 00:02:46.180
and more recently as an ambassador.

00:02:47.403 --> 00:02:49.172
Now, B Corps are a group of companies

00:02:49.196 --> 00:02:52.116
who believe in business
as a force for good.

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:56.395
There's a tough certification
with about 250 questions

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.685
about your social
and environmental performance.

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.426
You must legally declare your intention

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.410
to serve the community
as well as your shareholders

00:03:05.434 --> 00:03:09.323
and you must sign
the declaration of interdependence.

00:03:10.427 --> 00:03:12.903
Now one of the things
that inspires me the most

00:03:12.927 --> 00:03:14.969
about the companies in this movement

00:03:14.993 --> 00:03:17.839
is that they see themselves
as part of a whole system.

00:03:19.024 --> 00:03:24.532
It's sort of as if they imagine themselves
on a big, flowing river of activity,

00:03:24.556 --> 00:03:29.220
where, if they are, for example,
soft drinks manufacturers,

00:03:29.244 --> 00:03:32.371
they understand that upstream from them,

00:03:32.395 --> 00:03:35.371
there's water and sugar,

00:03:35.395 --> 00:03:37.640
and farmers that grow that sugar,

00:03:37.664 --> 00:03:40.735
and plastic and metal and glass,

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:43.659
all of which flows into this thing

00:03:43.683 --> 00:03:46.711
that we call a company
which has financial results.

00:03:47.252 --> 00:03:51.244
And the flowing continues
with consequences.

00:03:51.268 --> 00:03:52.752
Some of them intended,

00:03:52.776 --> 00:03:55.714
like refreshment and hydration,

00:03:55.738 --> 00:03:57.468
and some unintended,

00:03:57.492 --> 00:04:00.341
like garbage and obesity.

00:04:01.492 --> 00:04:03.428
Spending time with leaders in this space

00:04:03.452 --> 00:04:07.715
has led me to see
that true collaboration is possible,

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.373
but it's subtle and it's complex.

00:04:10.397 --> 00:04:13.960
And the leaders in this space
are doing a few things very differently

00:04:13.984 --> 00:04:16.160
from traditional heroic leaders.

00:04:17.125 --> 00:04:19.379
They set goals differently,

00:04:19.403 --> 00:04:21.783
they announce those goals differently

00:04:21.807 --> 00:04:25.125
and they have a very different
relationship with other people.

00:04:25.593 --> 00:04:27.875
Let's begin with the first difference.

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:33.402
A hero sets a goal
that can be individually delivered

00:04:33.426 --> 00:04:34.759
and neatly measured.

00:04:35.815 --> 00:04:37.641
You can recognize a heroic goal --

00:04:37.665 --> 00:04:40.683
they use terms like
"revenue" and "market share"

00:04:40.707 --> 00:04:42.612
and are often competitive.

00:04:42.636 --> 00:04:44.516
I mean, remember pink-suit day?

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.390
Interdependent leaders, on the other hand,

00:04:48.414 --> 00:04:50.656
start with a goal that's really important,

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.497
but is actually impossible to achieve
by one company or one person alone.

00:04:57.228 --> 00:04:59.895
I want to give you an example
from the clothing industry,

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.807
which produces 92 million tons
of waste a year.

00:05:04.744 --> 00:05:08.791
Patagonia and Eileen Fisher
are clothing manufacturers,

00:05:08.815 --> 00:05:10.514
both of them B Corps,

00:05:10.538 --> 00:05:13.946
both of them deeply committed
to reducing waste.

00:05:14.637 --> 00:05:18.406
They don't see
that their responsibility ends

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.518
when a customer buys their clothes.

00:05:21.034 --> 00:05:24.940
Patagonia encourages you
not to buy new clothes from them,

00:05:24.964 --> 00:05:27.955
and will repair your old clothes for free.

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.598
Eileen Fisher will pay you
when you bring back your clothes,

00:05:31.622 --> 00:05:35.130
and either sell them on
or turn them into other clothes.

00:05:36.276 --> 00:05:39.641
While these two companies
are competitive in some ways,

00:05:39.665 --> 00:05:42.228
they work together
and with others in the industry

00:05:42.252 --> 00:05:44.172
to solve shared problems.

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:48.602
They take responsibility for things
that happen upstream as well.

00:05:49.395 --> 00:05:50.561
Around the world,

00:05:50.585 --> 00:05:55.252
there are around 300 million people
who work from home in this industry,

00:05:55.276 --> 00:05:56.855
most of them women,

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:59.680
many of them in very
difficult circumstances

00:05:59.704 --> 00:06:01.252
with poor lighting,

00:06:01.276 --> 00:06:04.609
sewing on buttons
and doing detailed stitching.

00:06:05.117 --> 00:06:09.434
Until 2014, there was no protection
for these workers.

00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:14.212
A group of companies got together
with a not-for-profit called Nest

00:06:14.236 --> 00:06:16.037
to create a set of standards

00:06:16.061 --> 00:06:18.664
that's now been adopted
by the whole industry.

00:06:19.681 --> 00:06:23.594
Once you've seen problems like this,
you can't unsee them,

00:06:23.618 --> 00:06:26.483
so you have to ask others
to help you to solve them.

00:06:26.507 --> 00:06:28.978
These folks take
interdependence as a given,

00:06:29.002 --> 00:06:30.585
and said to me,

00:06:30.609 --> 00:06:32.942
"We don't compete on human rights."

00:06:34.236 --> 00:06:36.895
The second big difference
for collaborators

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:40.576
is their willingness to declare
their goals before they have a plan.

00:06:41.965 --> 00:06:46.497
Now the hero only reveals
their carefully crafted goal

00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:48.648
when the path to achieve it is clear.

00:06:48.989 --> 00:06:54.228
In fact, the role of the hero announcement
is to set the stage for the big win.

00:06:54.252 --> 00:06:56.852
Hero announcements are full of triumph.

00:06:58.112 --> 00:07:01.096
Interdependent leaders, on the other hand,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.938
want other people to help them,

00:07:02.962 --> 00:07:07.958
so their announcements are often
an invitation for co-creation,

00:07:07.982 --> 00:07:10.582
and sometimes, they're a call for help.

00:07:11.911 --> 00:07:15.307
At the North American division
of the French food company Danone,

00:07:15.331 --> 00:07:18.465
I announced that we wanted
to become a B Corp.

00:07:18.847 --> 00:07:20.498
And unlike pink-suit day,

00:07:20.522 --> 00:07:22.743
I had no plan to get there.

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:26.514
I remember the day really clearly.

00:07:26.538 --> 00:07:28.855
Everybody in the room gasped,

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:31.546
because they knew we didn't have a plan.

00:07:32.478 --> 00:07:37.022
But they also knew
that we had seen our role

00:07:37.046 --> 00:07:39.958
in the river that is the food system,

00:07:39.982 --> 00:07:42.049
and we wanted to make a change.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.595
Making that declaration without a plan

00:07:45.619 --> 00:07:48.318
meant that so many
young people in our company

00:07:48.342 --> 00:07:50.294
stepped up to help us,

00:07:50.318 --> 00:07:54.216
and B Corps around us all rallied around.

00:07:54.556 --> 00:07:56.434
And the day we became a B Corp

00:07:56.458 --> 00:08:00.910
wasn't just a self-congratulatory
moment of a hero company --

00:08:00.934 --> 00:08:04.037
it was more like a community celebration.

00:08:05.748 --> 00:08:09.160
Now when you gave goals
that you can't achieve alone,

00:08:09.184 --> 00:08:11.716
and you've told everyone about them,

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:16.141
inevitably, you'll end up
at the third big difference,

00:08:16.165 --> 00:08:18.260
which is how you see other people,

00:08:18.284 --> 00:08:20.886
inside your company and outside.

00:08:22.998 --> 00:08:27.363
Heroes see everyone
as a competitor or a follower.

00:08:28.736 --> 00:08:30.688
Heroes don't want input,

00:08:30.712 --> 00:08:34.069
because they want to control everything
because they want the credit.

00:08:34.673 --> 00:08:38.029
And you can see this
in a typical hero meeting.

00:08:38.617 --> 00:08:40.484
Heroes like making speeches.

00:08:41.752 --> 00:08:44.966
People lean back in their chairs,

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.934
maybe impressed but not engaged.

00:08:48.911 --> 00:08:50.926
Interdependent leaders, on the other hand,

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.437
understand that they need other people.

00:08:53.461 --> 00:08:57.342
They know that meetings
are not just mindless calendar fillers.

00:08:57.366 --> 00:08:59.842
These are the most precious
things you have.

00:08:59.866 --> 00:09:02.357
It's where people collaborate
and communicate

00:09:02.381 --> 00:09:03.984
and share ideas.

00:09:04.458 --> 00:09:07.315
People lean forward in meetings like this,

00:09:07.339 --> 00:09:09.606
wondering where they might fit in.

00:09:12.482 --> 00:09:14.545
When I was in Shanghai in China,

00:09:14.569 --> 00:09:17.862
where I lived for six years,
running the Kraft Foods business,

00:09:17.886 --> 00:09:21.600
selling, amongst
other things, Oreo cookies,

00:09:21.624 --> 00:09:23.958
we had a problem with hero culture.

00:09:25.337 --> 00:09:28.059
We kept on launching
new products that failed.

00:09:28.083 --> 00:09:29.631
And we would find out afterwards

00:09:29.655 --> 00:09:32.400
that everyone in the company
knew they were going to fail,

00:09:32.424 --> 00:09:34.244
they just didn't feel free to tell us.

00:09:34.268 --> 00:09:38.379
So we changed the way we ran
our innovation and planning meetings

00:09:38.403 --> 00:09:39.934
in two important ways.

00:09:39.958 --> 00:09:42.958
First of all, language
went back to Chinese.

00:09:43.351 --> 00:09:46.422
Because even though
everyone spoke great English,

00:09:46.446 --> 00:09:49.026
when I was in the room
and the meeting was in English,

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.214
they focused on me.

00:09:50.238 --> 00:09:52.311
And I was the foreigner,
and I was the boss

00:09:52.335 --> 00:09:55.526
and I apparently had
that intimidating hero look.

00:09:56.321 --> 00:09:57.606
The second thing

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:02.064
is we asked every single person
in the meeting their opinion.

00:10:02.765 --> 00:10:06.086
And our understanding
of the subtleties of the differences

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:09.863
between American taste
and Chinese taste, in this case,

00:10:09.887 --> 00:10:11.466
really improved,

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.424
and our new product success rate
radically turned around

00:10:14.448 --> 00:10:16.353
and we launched a lot of winners,

00:10:16.377 --> 00:10:20.224
including the now famous
green-tea-flavored Oreos.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.337
Hero culture sneaks in everywhere.

00:10:24.943 --> 00:10:28.006
At Danone, we had a lot
of great stuff happening

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.854
in one part of the world,

00:10:29.878 --> 00:10:32.768
and we wanted it to spread
to another part of the world.

00:10:33.482 --> 00:10:36.058
But when you put a person in business gear

00:10:36.082 --> 00:10:38.986
up in front of a group of people
with PowerPoint,

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:42.200
they have the urge
to become sort of heroic.

00:10:42.549 --> 00:10:44.527
And they make everything look super shiny

00:10:44.551 --> 00:10:46.224
and they don't tell the truth.

00:10:46.248 --> 00:10:49.629
And it's not compelling
and it's not even interesting.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.896
So, we changed it

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.141
and we created these
full-day marketplaces,

00:10:55.165 --> 00:10:56.899
kind of like a big bazaar.

00:10:57.292 --> 00:10:59.316
And everybody was dressed up in costume,

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.659
some people a little, some people a lot.

00:11:01.683 --> 00:11:03.977
And sellers had to man their stalls

00:11:04.001 --> 00:11:07.048
and sell their ideas
as persuasively as possible,

00:11:07.072 --> 00:11:10.855
and people who were convinced
bought them with fake check books.

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:13.367
Creating just a bit of silliness
with the environment

00:11:13.391 --> 00:11:14.752
and a hat or a scarf

00:11:14.776 --> 00:11:19.719
drops people's guard and causes
ideas to spread like wildfire.

00:11:20.243 --> 00:11:22.275
There's no recipe here,

00:11:22.299 --> 00:11:27.931
but time together has to be
carefully curated and created

00:11:27.955 --> 00:11:32.514
so that people know that their time
is valuable and important,

00:11:32.538 --> 00:11:34.950
and they can bring
their best selves to the table.

00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:39.871
Hero culture is present right here in TED.

00:11:40.705 --> 00:11:45.210
This whole process makes it look like
I think I'm a hero.

00:11:46.157 --> 00:11:50.852
So just in case there's any doubt
about the point that I'm trying to make,

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:53.185
I want to apply these ideas

00:11:53.209 --> 00:11:56.056
in an area in which
I have zero credibility

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:57.796
and zero experience.

00:11:58.225 --> 00:12:00.249
I'm originally South African,

00:12:00.273 --> 00:12:03.323
and I'm deeply passionate
about wildlife conservation,

00:12:03.347 --> 00:12:05.283
most particularly rhinos.

00:12:05.648 --> 00:12:08.327
Those majestic creatures with big horns.

00:12:09.624 --> 00:12:12.569
Every day, three rhinos are killed,

00:12:12.593 --> 00:12:16.656
because there are people
who think that those horns are valuable,

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.884
even though they're just made
of the same stuff

00:12:18.908 --> 00:12:20.575
as hair and fingernails.

00:12:21.891 --> 00:12:23.157
It breaks my heart.

00:12:25.106 --> 00:12:27.915
Like all good recovering heroes,

00:12:27.939 --> 00:12:31.680
I did everything I could
to reduce this goal

00:12:31.704 --> 00:12:34.304
to something that I could do by myself.

00:12:35.085 --> 00:12:40.015
But clearly, stopping rhino poaching
is a goal way too big for me.

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.585
So I'm immediately
in interdependence land.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.656
I'm declaring my goal on this stage.

00:12:48.252 --> 00:12:50.863
I found other people as passionate as I am

00:12:50.887 --> 00:12:52.895
and I've asked if I could join them.

00:12:52.919 --> 00:12:55.307
And after today, there may be more.

00:12:55.331 --> 00:12:58.741
And we're now in the complex
but inspiring process

00:12:58.765 --> 00:13:00.704
of learning how to work together.

00:13:01.046 --> 00:13:04.268
My dream is that one day,
someone will stand on this stage

00:13:04.292 --> 00:13:09.053
and tell you how radical interdependence
saved my beloved rhinos.

00:13:10.442 --> 00:13:12.638
Why does hero culture persist,

00:13:12.662 --> 00:13:15.062
and why don't we work together more?

00:13:15.784 --> 00:13:17.903
Well, I don't know
why everyone else does it,

00:13:17.927 --> 00:13:20.060
but I can tell you why I did it.

00:13:20.496 --> 00:13:23.987
Interdependence is a lot harder
than being a hero.

00:13:24.694 --> 00:13:28.250
It requires us to be open
and transparent and vulnerable,

00:13:28.274 --> 00:13:31.884
and that's not what traditional leaders
have been trained to do.

00:13:33.048 --> 00:13:35.848
I thought being a hero would keep me safe.

00:13:37.056 --> 00:13:39.119
I thought that in the elevation

00:13:39.143 --> 00:13:42.315
and separation that comes
from heroic leadership,

00:13:42.339 --> 00:13:44.815
that I would be untouchable.

00:13:46.228 --> 00:13:47.561
This is an illusion.

00:13:48.776 --> 00:13:52.823
The joy and success that comes
from interdependence and vulnerability

00:13:52.847 --> 00:13:54.980
is worth the effort and the risk.

00:13:56.339 --> 00:14:00.116
And if we're going to solve the challenges
that the world is facing today,

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.748
we have no alternative,

00:14:01.772 --> 00:14:04.572
so we had better start getting good at it.

00:14:05.532 --> 00:14:06.682
Thank you.

00:14:06.706 --> 00:14:11.595
(Applause)
