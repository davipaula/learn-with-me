00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.256
Today, there are 1.8 billion young people

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.920
between the ages
of 10 and 24 in the world.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.656
It is the largest cohort in human history.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.616
Meeting their needs
will be a big challenge.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.776
But it's also a big opportunity.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.336
They hold our shared future
in their hands.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.176
Every day, we read about young people
lending their ideas and passions

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.216
to fighting for change,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.496
social change, political change,
change in their communities.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.640
Imagine what they'll create:
breakthroughs, inventions.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.696
Maybe new medicines,
new modes of transportation,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.736
new ways to communicate,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.296
sustainable economies
and maybe even a world at peace.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.216
But this opportunity, this youth dividend,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.680
is not a given.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.096
One point eight billion
young women and young men

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.640
are standing at the door of adulthood.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.256
Are they ready?

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.640
Right now, too few of them are.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.136
My favorite part of my job at UNICEF

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.696
is a chance to talk to, meet with
and hear from young people

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.656
all around the world.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.576
And they tell me
about their hopes and dreams.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.656
And they have amazing hopes and dreams

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.080
for what they'll accomplish
in their lives.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.600
But what they're also telling me
is that they have fears.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.336
They feel that they're facing
a series of urgent crises.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.936
A crisis of demographics,

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.336
a crisis of education,

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.616
a crisis of employment,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.696
a crisis of violence

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.960
and a crisis for girls.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.616
If you look at these crises,
you realize that they're urgent

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.056
and they need to be addressed now.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.560
Because they tell us that they're worried.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.256
They're worried that they might not get
the education that they need.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.496
And you know what?

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.096
They're right.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.936
Two hundred million adolescents
are out of school worldwide,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.616
about the population of Brazil.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.616
And those that are in school

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.056
feel that they may not be getting
the right skills.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.376
Globally, six in 10
children and young people

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.640
do not meet the minimum proficiency level
for reading and mathematics.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.856
No country can be successful

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.296
if nearly half of its population
of young people

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.840
are unable to read or write.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.856
And what about the lucky few
who are in secondary school?

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.056
Many of them are dropping out
because they're worried

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.256
that they're not getting skills
that they can use to make a livelihood.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.216
And sometimes, their parents
can no longer afford the fees.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.440
It's a tragedy.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.336
And young people are also telling me
that they're worried about employment,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.440
that they won't be able to find a job.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.760
And again, they're right.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.880
Every month, 10 million
young people reach working age.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.896
It's a staggering number.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.136
Some will go on for further education,
but many will enter the workforce.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.480
And our world is not creating
10 million new jobs each month.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.120
The competition is fierce
for the jobs that are available.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.896
So, imagine being a young person today,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.136
needing a job, seeking a livelihood,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.216
ready to build a future,

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.000
and opportunities are hard to find.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.096
Young people are also telling me

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.856
that they're worried that they're not
getting the skills that they need.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.680
And again, they're right.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.216
We are finding ourselves
at a time in the world

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.216
when the world
is changing so fast for work.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.616
We're in the fourth industrial revolution.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.816
Young people do not want to be
on the farms and in rural communities.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.856
They want to go to the cities.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.856
They want to learn future skills
for future work.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.136
They want to learn digital technology
and green technologies.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.776
They want to have a chance
to learn modern agriculture.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.536
They want to learn business
and entrepreneurship,

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.616
so that they can create
a business of their own.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:50.176
They want to be nurses and radiologists
and pharmacists and doctors.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.080
And they want to have all of the skills
that they'll need for the future.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.456
They also want to learn the trades,
like construction and electricians.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.456
These are all the professions
that a country needs,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.760
as well as the professions
that have not been invented yet.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.760
And young people are also telling me
that they're worried about violence.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.656
At home, online, in school,
in their communities.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.760
And again, they're right.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.856
A young person can have
hundreds of friends on social media,

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.856
but when they need
to find a friendly face,

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.936
someone who can be there
as their friend, to talk to,

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.176
they do not find one.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.216
They face bullying, harassment and more.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.256
And hundreds of millions
are facing exploitation

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.320
and abuse, and violence.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.376
Every seven minutes,
an adolescent boy or girl

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.120
somewhere in the world
is killed by an act of violence.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.776
And girls are telling me

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.096
that they're especially worried
about their futures.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.776
And sadly, they're right, too.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.856
Girls face prejudice and discrimination.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.896
They face early childhood marriage

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.320
and they face life-threatening
early pregnancy.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.576
Imagine a population of the United States.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.056
Now double it.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.856
That's the number of women who
were married before their 18th birthday.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.616
Six hundred and fifty million.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.000
And many were mothers
while they were still children themselves.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.536
One out of every three women
will face physical abuse

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.080
or sexual abuse in her lifetime.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.320
So, no wonder girls are worried
about their futures.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.936
These urgent crises may not be a reality
in your life or in your neighborhood.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.896
And perhaps you've had opportunities
for a good education

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.536
and for marketable skills,
and for getting a job.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.656
And maybe you've never faced violence,
or prejudice, or discrimination.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.016
But there are tens of millions
of young people who are not so lucky.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.496
And they are sounding the alarm
for their futures.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.576
And that is why UNICEF
and our many public and private partners

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.576
are launching a new global initiative.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.616
Young people themselves have named it.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.576
And it's called Generation Unlimited

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.320
or Gen-U or Gen you.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.456
So, what they're saying is,
it's our time, it's our turn,

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.920
it's our future.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.696
Our goal is very straightforward.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.576
We want every young person
in school, learning, training,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.320
or age-appropriate employment
by the year 2030.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.256
This goal is urgent,
it's necessary, it's ambitious.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.560
But we think it's also achievable.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.216
So we're calling out
for cutting-edge solutions

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.096
and new ideas.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:04.056
Ideas that will give young people
a fighting chance for their futures.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.816
We don't know all the answers,

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.216
so we're reaching out to businesses
and governments, and nonprofits,

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.856
and academia, and communities,
and innovators for help.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.696
Gen-U is to be an open platform,

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.776
where people can come
and share their ideas and solutions

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.936
about what works, what does not work,

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.160
and importantly, what might work.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:35.056
So if we can take these ideas
and add a little bit of seed money,

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.056
and add some good partners,

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.336
and add good political will,

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:43.576
we think they can scale up to reach
thousands and millions of people

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.799
around the world.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.216
And with this project,
we're also going to do something new.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.856
We're going to co-design
and co-create with young people.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.775
So with Gen-U, they're going to be
in the driver's seat,

00:08:55.799 --> 00:08:57.800
steering us all along the way.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.416
In Argentina, there's a program
where we connect students

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.496
who are in rural, remote,
hard to reach mountainous communities,

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.136
with something they've seldom seen:

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.656
a secondary school teacher.

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:19.296
So these students come to a classroom,
they're joined by a community teacher

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.536
and they're connected
to urban schools online.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.376
And there is the secondary school teacher,

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.776
who is teaching them
about digital technology

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.656
and a good secondary school education,

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.040
without them ever having to leave
their own communities.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.176
And in South Africa,
there's a program called Techno Girls.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.896
And these are girls
from disadvantaged neighborhoods

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.216
who are studying the STEM program area:

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.376
science, technology, engineering and math.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.376
And they have a chance to job shadow.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.976
This is the way that they then
can see themselves

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.016
in jobs that are in engineering,

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.520
in science, and maybe
in the space program.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.656
In Bangladesh,

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.696
we have partners who are training
tens of thousands of young people

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.016
in the trades,

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.256
so that they can become
motorcycle repair people,

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.736
or mobile phone service people.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.096
But these are a chance to see
their own livelihoods.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.320
And maybe even to have
a business of their own.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.016
And in Vietnam,

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.856
there's a program where
we are pairing young entrepreneurs

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.896
with the needs in their own
local communities.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.856
So with this program, a group gathered

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.776
and they decided that they would
solve the problem of transportation

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.096
for people with disabilities
in their communities.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.416
So with a mentor
and a bit of seed funding,

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.040
they've now developed a new app
to help the whole community.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.416
And I've seen how these programs
can make a difference.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.936
When I was in Lebanon,
I visited a program called Girls Got IT,

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.760
or Girls Got It.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.576
And in this program,
girls who have been studying

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.416
computer skills and the STEM program

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.696
have a chance to work side by side
with young professionals,

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.576
so that they can learn firsthand

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.256
what it's like to be an architect,
a designer or a scientist.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.496
And when you see these girls,
smiles on their faces,

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.216
the hot lights in their eyes,

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.816
they are so excited,
they have hope for the future.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.056
They want to change the world.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.376
And now, with this program
and these mentors,

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.240
they'll be able to do it.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.976
But these ideas and programs
are just a start.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.840
They'll only reach a fraction
of the young people that we need to reach.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.776
We want to take these ideas
and find ways to scale them up.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.256
To reach more young people
in more communities,

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.976
in more places around the world.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.320
And we want to dream big.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.776
Could every school,
everywhere in the world,

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.616
no matter how remote or mountainous,

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:04.616
or even if it's in a refugee camp,

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.096
could they be connected to the internet?

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.976
Could we have instant translation
for young people,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.136
so that you could get a good education

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.760
in your own language,
anywhere in the world?

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.096
And would it be possible

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.016
that we could connect
the education in your school

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.496
with skills that you're going to need
to get a job in your own community?

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.720
So that you actually can move
from school to work.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.616
And more.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.200
Can each one of us help?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.336
In our everyday lives
and in our workplaces,

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.800
are there ways that we could
support young people?

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.616
Young people are asking us
for apprenticeships,

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.696
for job shadowing, for internships.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.920
Could we do this?

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.816
Young people are also asking us
for work-study programs,

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.816
places where they can learn and earn.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.456
Could we do this and could we
reach out to a community that's nearby,

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.080
that's less advantaged, and help them?

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.856
Young people are also saying
that they want to help other young people.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.856
They want more space and more voice,

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.896
so that they can gather
to help each other.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:20.016
In HIV centers, in refugee camps,

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.520
but also to stop online bullying
and early child marriage.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.976
We need ideas, we need
ideas that are big and small,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.520
ideas that are local and global.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.816
This, in the end, is our responsibility.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:42.736
A massive generation of young people
are about to inherit our world.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.856
It is our duty to leave a legacy
of hope and opportunity

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.296
for them but also with them.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.696
Young people are
25 percent of our population.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.656
But they are 100 percent of our future.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.776
And they're calling out
for a fighting chance

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.376
to build a better world.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.616
So their call should be our calling.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.496
The calling of our time.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.856
The time is now, the need is urgent.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:18.320
And 1.8 billion young people are waiting.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.656
Thank you.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:24.680
(Applause)
