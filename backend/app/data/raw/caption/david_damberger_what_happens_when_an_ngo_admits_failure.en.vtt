00:00:08.018 --> 00:00:10.313
Meet Inook. He is a pretty happy guy.

00:00:10.314 --> 00:00:12.987
And I'd be pretty happy too
if this was the first time

00:00:12.988 --> 00:00:15.939
that my community
had just gained access to fresh water.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.707
Inook is from the country of Malawi,

00:00:17.708 --> 00:00:20.832
the small sliver of a country
in Southern Africa,

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:22.847
known as the warm heart of Africa.

00:00:22.848 --> 00:00:26.144
Over the past 10 years, five million
more people like Inook in Malawi

00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:28.834
have gained access to fresh water.

00:00:28.835 --> 00:00:34.295
But what's unfortunate
is that this picture is a lie.

00:00:34.775 --> 00:00:37.345
I'll come back to that in a second.

00:00:37.346 --> 00:00:41.362
10 years ago, two Waterloo engineers
sparked a movement across Canada,

00:00:41.363 --> 00:00:43.142
"Engineers without borders."

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:47.165
This movement was based on the concept
that it was completely unacceptable

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:50.808
that 5 million people in Malawi
did not have access to fresh water,

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.729
when us, engineers back in Canada
were working on problems

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.242
such as making a photocopier
increase its speed

00:00:56.243 --> 00:00:59.150
from 149 pages a minute
to 151 pages per minute.

00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:01.718
We needed to work
on problems that mattered.

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.694
I was fortunated, I found
the Calgary chapter here,

00:01:04.694 --> 00:01:08.475
I got to be the first director
of overseas programs for EWB in Africa,

00:01:08.476 --> 00:01:09.868
where I worked for 4 years,

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.630
and I got to work with hundreds of
businesses, non government organizations,

00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:16.377
governments, all working
in this field of development.

00:01:16.378 --> 00:01:19.648
It was really fantastic working for EWB

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.818
because even though we worked
on hundred-million-dollar projects

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:24.612
we had this philosophy

00:01:24.613 --> 00:01:28.506
that if we were really going to understand
the problems in local Africa,

00:01:28.507 --> 00:01:31.190
we needed to live like local Africans.

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.784
As a lot of ex-patriots
would spend most of the time

00:01:33.785 --> 00:01:36.048
in the capital cities and boardrooms,

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.374
we'd spend our time in villages

00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:41.763
learning local languages,
traveling on public transports.

00:01:41.764 --> 00:01:45.932
And what this allowed us to do
was to get a really deep understanding

00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:47.942
of what was going on at the field level,

00:01:47.943 --> 00:01:51.862
And combined with this experience
— and hundreds of other EWB experiences —

00:01:51.863 --> 00:01:55.846
we got a really interesting perspective
of what's going on in this aid industry.

00:01:55.847 --> 00:01:58.298
The aid industry has got
a lot of attention lately,

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.939
economists have become authors
and have written about it

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.632
and there's a lot of controversy
about its effectiveness,

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:07.142
some even asking
the question, "Has aid failed?"

00:02:07.143 --> 00:02:09.931
It's a very interesting question.

00:02:09.933 --> 00:02:14.032
Now, I am confident to say
on behalf of EWB staff members

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:18.393
that failed or not, we definitely feel
that the aid system is broken.

00:02:19.313 --> 00:02:22.582
And when I say broken it's not
what the media usually talks about.

00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:25.832
It's not about corrupt dictators
or about corruption,

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:28.882
— those issues still happen in Africa

00:02:28.883 --> 00:02:32.272
but they are much more the minority
than they are the mainstream today.

00:02:32.273 --> 00:02:36.742
I am talking about aid being broken
in democratic elected, stable governments

00:02:36.743 --> 00:02:40.549
with no civil unrest, countries
like Ghana, Malawi, and Zambia.

00:02:41.612 --> 00:02:43.463
So I'll talk about Malawi.

00:02:44.243 --> 00:02:48.482
The World Bank has stated
that 80% of the people in Malawi

00:02:48.483 --> 00:02:50.364
have access to fresh water sources.

00:02:50.365 --> 00:02:53.319
So one of our staff members
in Malawi, this is Owen,

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.519
was visiting one of those water points.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.886
It was a gravity-fed system

00:02:56.887 --> 00:02:59.158
that was commissioned
by the Canadian government

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.160
and finished about a year and a half ago.

00:03:01.161 --> 00:03:03.559
A gravity fed system
is basically a bunch of pipes

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.119
that pipe water down
from an elevated region,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.522
into a number of communities

00:03:07.523 --> 00:03:10.085
where there are taps
and people can access that water.

00:03:10.086 --> 00:03:13.619
He was going around turning on those taps
and some of them weren't working,

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.319
so he asked the community,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.419
"How many of these are working?"
and they said, "Out of a 113, 81."

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.909
81? What's the problem? What's going on?

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.419
He found out that a lot of the pipes
had sprung leaks and had broken down.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.619
All right, not a big deal,
pipes break down everywhere.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.209
But the problem with this project was that
even though the infrastructure was built

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.939
there was no thinking about
who is going to maintain this system.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.389
And some people took initiative
and tried to fix the pipes themselves

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.849
but there was a lack
of affordable spare parts available.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.400
This situation is typical.

00:03:50.487 --> 00:03:55.756
This is a graphic showing one area
of Malawi, I think it's an urban area,

00:03:55.757 --> 00:03:59.066
where the green dots
are functional water points,

00:03:59.067 --> 00:04:01.776
yellow are the ones
that are working but breaking down,

00:04:01.777 --> 00:04:03.676
and red are not functional.

00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:07.426
Hardly 80% and actually, EWB
has done some work and found out

00:04:07.427 --> 00:04:13.526
that even out of those 80% coverage
of water points, 40% are not working.

00:04:13.527 --> 00:04:17.653
See, this issue is
a lot of donors and projects

00:04:17.654 --> 00:04:20.199
end up on focusing
on the hardware side of the issue

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.264
and not really realizing the importance
of the software side of things.

00:04:24.265 --> 00:04:27.867
At first it's like ' "Wow, software!"
of course you have to do maintenance,

00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:30.657
but when you think
about people donating into charities,

00:04:30.658 --> 00:04:33.697
it makes you feel a lot better
if you know that your money went

00:04:33.698 --> 00:04:36.337
to something tangible,
something like a well, a school,

00:04:36.338 --> 00:04:38.203
something like giving a family a goat.

00:04:38.204 --> 00:04:40.689
It's not as sexy and easy
to tell your friends about

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.557
how you helped fund a water committee
or paid for teacher salaries.

00:04:45.558 --> 00:04:48.959
So when I say that this picture
of Inook is a lie,

00:04:50.522 --> 00:04:53.129
it's not a lie when the picture is taken

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.520
it only becomes a lie,
a year or two afterwards.

00:04:58.588 --> 00:05:01.577
When looking at this picture
one of my great colleagues said,

00:05:01.578 --> 00:05:04.307
"Everything people see
from Africa doesn't matter.

00:05:04.308 --> 00:05:07.747
And everything that matters
from Africa, people don't get to see."

00:05:07.748 --> 00:05:11.447
And this problem goes a lot further
that just broken down water points.

00:05:11.448 --> 00:05:15.937
Owen, after seeing this water point,
discovered not more than 30 feet away:

00:05:15.938 --> 00:05:19.517
"Hey there's another set of taps
that look really broken down too

00:05:19.518 --> 00:05:21.747
but they are not attached to the system."

00:05:21.748 --> 00:05:24.377
And he asked the community,
"What of that? What's that?"

00:05:24.378 --> 00:05:28.527
They said: "Oh, that's the American
government gravity-fed water system."

00:05:28.528 --> 00:05:31.497
It was built over ten years ago.

00:05:31.498 --> 00:05:33.377
He said, "What happened to that?"

00:05:33.378 --> 00:05:36.528
"Oh, it also broke down
about a year and a half later."

00:05:37.155 --> 00:05:41.104
How is it that a project
that failed ten years ago

00:05:41.105 --> 00:05:44.925
was rebuilt [with] almost
the same technology and process

00:05:44.926 --> 00:05:48.267
and had exactly the same failures
ten years later?

00:05:49.227 --> 00:05:53.079
I recently joined a startup company
that sells goods online,

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.309
that uses a lot of Africa fair trade goods
sort of the ethical Ebay or Amazon.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.009
And what we've learned,
as being a private sector startup

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.889
is that if we don't serve our customers

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.309
and we don't provide them the product
that they need, they won't buy it.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.129
And if we don't innovate, change and adapt
to their needs, we go out of business.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.249
So they have a power
to hold us accountable.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.809
If we look to the public sector,

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.699
it doesn't adapt and change quite as fast
as the private sector, but, in the end,

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.339
if the elected government doesn't meet
the needs of its constituency,

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.479
they have a chance
to vote them out of power,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.159
therefore holding them accountable.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.595
But in the development sector,

00:06:25.596 --> 00:06:28.211
if they don't serve the needs
of their beneficiaries

00:06:28.212 --> 00:06:31.719
— and aren't only NGO's, they're
governments and businesses as well —

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.309
the beneficiaries have no power
to vote them out or to fire them.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.779
The people who have
that power are the donors.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.279
And when you look at the system,
you start to see some of the challenges.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.519
Development is the sector
that focuses more on pleasing the donors,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.819
and making them happy,
and communicating to them,

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.699
as opposed to understanding
the needs of the beneficiaries.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.259
Because of that systematic challenge
is very slow to innovate,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.469
there's very little change,
and you get exactly the same project

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.229
built ten years later that fails
in exactly the same way.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.769
So what we do about this?

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.629
First answer is easy, we invest

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.569
in the private and the public sectors
in the developing world.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.529
They are inheritedly structurally built
to be more sustainable

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.119
and to allow beneficiaries
to hold them accountable.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.939
However, 70% of people
in sub-Saharian Africa

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.019
still make less than 2 dollars
a day, they are still in poverty.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.399
And the reason is

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.059
because the private and the public sector
are not serving them appropriately.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.409
So we do need to invest in businesses
and in governments in Africa,

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:28.719
but it's still going to take a long time
for the problems to be fixed.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.489
Therefore it leaves us with the one option
and we need to work with this system.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:33.919
Therefore we have to fix it,

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.899
to make it more accountable,
more creative, more transparent.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.909
We need to start innovating,
coming up with really neat ideas,

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.619
ideas like giving beneficiaries
a chance to rate their project

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.129
using their mobile phones,

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.249
that donors and NGOs can understand.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.069
Or moving our donors
closer to our beneficiaries.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.639
Currently, only 20% of the Canadian

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.239
international development agencies'
African staff are based in Africa.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.419
Ideas like funding development sectors,
like VCs Fund businesses.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.949
What would it be like

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:07.509
if a donor funded ten projects
and expected four of them to do OK,

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.549
one of them to do fantastic,
and five of them to fail?

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.689
And not all of the solutions
need to be that complex.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:18.079
EWB is working out on one
that's actually quite simple,

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.509
it's admitting failure.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:24.470
My first project with EWB was in India,
where I worked with a bunch of schools.

00:08:24.475 --> 00:08:27.764
Poor of the poorest of schools
in India, with the untouchable cast.

00:08:27.765 --> 00:08:30.714
This is Bani, she was a girl
who was in one of those schools

00:08:30.715 --> 00:08:33.984
and she and her classmates had to
spend from two to three hours a day

00:08:33.985 --> 00:08:36.784
walking and collecting water
to bring it back to the school

00:08:36.784 --> 00:08:40.394
so they could have fresh water to drink,
and for cooking, and the bathroom.

00:08:40.395 --> 00:08:43.284
My job as an EWB was
to help solve the problem.

00:08:43.284 --> 00:08:46.534
I worked with the communities
and their rain water harvest solutions

00:08:46.535 --> 00:08:49.380
were to collect water from
the rooftops during the monsoons

00:08:49.381 --> 00:08:52.488
bring it through gutters, filter
and store it for the dry season.

00:08:52.489 --> 00:08:54.074
After a number of months I left,

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:56.704
we had our project funded
and was being implemented.

00:08:56.705 --> 00:08:59.434
I returned back home
to Canada almost a hero.

00:08:59.435 --> 00:09:02.334
My friends and family
were like, "Wow, it's fantastic!

00:09:02.335 --> 00:09:06.088
You gave up your job in the oil
and gas sector to volunteer in India,

00:09:06.089 --> 00:09:08.283
that's really inspiring."

00:09:09.163 --> 00:09:11.696
A year later I contacted my NGO

00:09:11.697 --> 00:09:16.016
to see how everything was going
with the rain water harvesting systems.

00:09:16.017 --> 00:09:20.937
And they told me that not
a single one was still operating.

00:09:22.084 --> 00:09:24.863
The reason was a lot
of them had been built,

00:09:24.864 --> 00:09:27.883
but some of them had broken down

00:09:27.884 --> 00:09:31.573
because there is
no maintenance schedule plan in place.

00:09:31.574 --> 00:09:35.454
I've made the exact same mistake
that I criticized earlier.

00:09:37.116 --> 00:09:41.476
When I thought about my friends and family
back home who thought I was such a hero

00:09:41.487 --> 00:09:43.545
I felt like an impostor.

00:09:44.525 --> 00:09:47.725
I thought of Beni,
I didn't helped her at all.

00:09:48.678 --> 00:09:53.027
Admitting failure is actually quite hard
and I didn't tell many people about this,

00:09:53.028 --> 00:09:57.027
and one of the only things
that helped me feel better about this

00:09:57.028 --> 00:09:59.307
— and is a bit of shame to say this —

00:09:59.308 --> 00:10:03.637
was that I started to learn
that other people in EWB had failed too.

00:10:03.638 --> 00:10:08.047
But EWB have this culture of embracing
failure openly, letting us talk about it,

00:10:08.048 --> 00:10:12.107
and was only through a bunch of us talking
about failure that we really got to see

00:10:12.108 --> 00:10:14.477
we are making a lot of mistakes
and we got to see

00:10:14.478 --> 00:10:17.127
we are making the same ones
and we can learn from them.

00:10:17.128 --> 00:10:19.167
And we started to innovate and to change.

00:10:19.167 --> 00:10:20.816
EWB is drastically different now,

00:10:20.816 --> 00:10:24.285
ten years later than what we thought
EWB should be doing in development.

00:10:24.285 --> 00:10:26.127
We don't build water points anymore.

00:10:26.128 --> 00:10:29.967
As a matter of fact, we don't build
anything other that spreadsheets.

00:10:29.968 --> 00:10:32.207
Now we have
this innovative marketing campaign

00:10:32.208 --> 00:10:34.057
"Sponsor an African spreadsheet,"

00:10:34.058 --> 00:10:37.337
because we understand that
the problems are not hardware problems

00:10:37.338 --> 00:10:39.357
is all about that software side of things.

00:10:39.358 --> 00:10:41.827
It's a really hard concept
to get across to people,

00:10:41.828 --> 00:10:43.847
they still want to fund wells and schools,

00:10:43.848 --> 00:10:46.247
but it's really about
the software side of things,

00:10:46.248 --> 00:10:50.917
and it's a lot longer process to fund
those things; is not sexy, but it works.

00:10:50.918 --> 00:10:55.104
So our staff members were really exited
to share this failure internally

00:10:55.105 --> 00:10:58.545
but we still were not doing a good job
of letting other people know,

00:10:58.545 --> 00:11:02.014
and some very courageous field staff
were getting upset at the management

00:11:02.015 --> 00:11:05.524
because other projects were making
the same failures and weren't learning.

00:11:05.525 --> 00:11:08.624
They pushed our management staff
— and we were nervous about it —

00:11:08.625 --> 00:11:11.454
about publishing our failures,
but for the last three years,

00:11:11.455 --> 00:11:16.394
EWB has published an annual failure report
sighting our biggest failures.

00:11:16.395 --> 00:11:18.934
At first I was asked,
"How did your donors think?"

00:11:18.935 --> 00:11:22.490
and I think how would my donors feel

00:11:22.491 --> 00:11:27.766
if they knew that the money they've spent
and saved up, and generously donated,

00:11:27.767 --> 00:11:29.954
had had no impact?"

00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:32.234
And you know, that's tough.

00:11:32.235 --> 00:11:34.134
Our donors felt that too.

00:11:34.135 --> 00:11:37.164
But once they started
reading the failures,

00:11:37.165 --> 00:11:39.670
they understood the power
of those lessons learned

00:11:39.671 --> 00:11:42.396
and realized is an injustice
not to be sharing these.

00:11:42.397 --> 00:11:46.644
Then we realized that no one reads reports
so we built a site, admittingfailure.com.

00:11:46.645 --> 00:11:50.494
This is for all organizations to come,
and start admitting their failures,

00:11:50.495 --> 00:11:53.254
and to start having
a discussion about failure.

00:11:53.255 --> 00:11:54.724
The concept is catching on.

00:11:54.725 --> 00:11:57.014
The Harvard Business Review
— just last month —

00:11:57.015 --> 00:11:59.314
published their first review
focused on failure.

00:11:59.315 --> 00:12:01.904
Two big companies lately
have also dealt with failure.

00:12:01.905 --> 00:12:04.744
I'm talking to my friends
in other sectors and they tell me

00:12:04.745 --> 00:12:08.454
not only the development sector has
these challenges, [it crosses to others].

00:12:08.455 --> 00:12:11.694
Two companies had failures lately,
and what's interesting about them

00:12:11.695 --> 00:12:14.804
is that one publicly admitted
their failure and talked about

00:12:14.805 --> 00:12:17.934
what they've learned from it,
what they're going to do next time.

00:12:17.935 --> 00:12:21.434
The other one tried
not to talk about it at all.

00:12:21.435 --> 00:12:26.994
It will be interesting looking forward
to see which of those strategies works.

00:12:26.995 --> 00:12:30.904
Firstly, I'd like to ask
people to think about

00:12:30.905 --> 00:12:36.144
how does your organization
think about and share failure.

00:12:36.145 --> 00:12:37.694
Maybe ask the person next to you

00:12:37.695 --> 00:12:40.914
because it can generate
really interesting conversations.

00:12:40.915 --> 00:12:45.764
And lastly, I'd like to turn back
to this question, "Has aid failed?"

00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:48.894
I think I'll say that, for me,
the answer is 'yes, '

00:12:48.895 --> 00:12:52.574
but only because it hasn't failed enough.

00:12:52.575 --> 00:12:53.894
Thank you.

00:12:53.895 --> 00:12:55.265
(Applause)
