00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.911
Do you ever think about what would happen

00:00:14.935 --> 00:00:17.518
if the world were a little bit different?

00:00:17.542 --> 00:00:19.101
How your life would be different

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:21.768
if you were born 5,000 years from now

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:23.083
instead of today?

00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:25.476
How history would be different

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.643
if the continents
were at different latitudes

00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:31.601
or how life in the Solar system
would have developed

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:34.167
if the Sun were 10 percent larger.

00:00:35.292 --> 00:00:38.184
Well, playing with these
kinds of possibilities

00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:39.809
is what I get to do for a living

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:42.000
but with the entire universe.

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.851
I make model universes in a computer.

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:48.809
Digital universes that have
different starting points

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:53.434
and are made of different amounts
of different kinds of material.

00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:56.768
And then I compare
these universes to our own

00:00:56.792 --> 00:01:00.500
to see what it is made of
and how it evolved.

00:01:02.542 --> 00:01:06.893
This process of testing models
with measurements of the sky

00:01:06.917 --> 00:01:09.792
has taught us a huge amount
about our universe so far.

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:12.851
One of the strangest
things we have learned

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:15.434
is that most of the material
in the universe

00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:19.375
is made of something
entirely different than you and me.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.476
But without it,

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.000
the universe as we know it wouldn't exist.

00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:32.559
Everything we can see with telescopes

00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:36.958
makes up just about 15 percent
of the total mass in the universe.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.393
Everything else, 85 percent of it,

00:01:42.417 --> 00:01:44.750
doesn't emit or absorb light.

00:01:45.708 --> 00:01:48.059
We can't see it with our eyes,

00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:51.601
we can't detect it with radio waves

00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:54.042
or microwaves or any other kind of light.

00:01:55.083 --> 00:01:57.018
But we know it is there

00:01:57.042 --> 00:01:59.417
because of its influence
on what we can see.

00:02:01.208 --> 00:02:02.476
It's a little bit like,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.684
if you wanted to map
the surface of our planet

00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:06.684
and everything on it

00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:10.375
using this picture of the Earth
from space at night.

00:02:11.708 --> 00:02:14.184
You get some clues
from where the light is,

00:02:14.208 --> 00:02:16.018
but there's a lot that you can't see,

00:02:16.042 --> 00:02:19.684
everything from people
to mountain ranges.

00:02:19.708 --> 00:02:24.167
And you have to infer what is there
from these limited clues.

00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.875
We call this unseen stuff "dark matter."

00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:32.601
Now, a lot of people
have heard of dark matter,

00:02:32.625 --> 00:02:34.934
but even if you have heard of it,

00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.976
it probably seems abstract,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.958
far away, probably even irrelevant.

00:02:42.625 --> 00:02:45.434
Well, the interesting thing is,

00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:47.976
dark matter is all around us

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.934
and probably right here.

00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.893
In fact, dark matter particles

00:02:52.917 --> 00:02:56.059
are probably going through
your body right now

00:02:56.083 --> 00:02:58.059
as you sit in this room.

00:02:58.083 --> 00:02:59.434
Because we are on Earth

00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:01.309
and Earth is spinning around the Sun,

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:04.268
and the Sun is hurtling through our galaxy

00:03:04.292 --> 00:03:07.518
at about half a million miles per hour.

00:03:07.542 --> 00:03:09.351
But dark matter doesn't bump into us,

00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:10.875
it just goes right through us.

00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:17.018
So how do we figure out more about this?

00:03:17.042 --> 00:03:18.309
What is it,

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:20.768
and what does it have to do
with our existence?

00:03:20.792 --> 00:03:25.559
Well, in order to figure out
how we came to be,

00:03:25.583 --> 00:03:29.559
we first need to understand
how our galaxy came to be.

00:03:29.583 --> 00:03:34.059
This is a picture of our galaxy,
the Milky Way, today.

00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:36.434
What did it look like
10 billion years in the past

00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:39.875
or what would it look like
10 billion years in the future?

00:03:40.917 --> 00:03:42.351
What about the stories

00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:45.018
of the hundreds of millions
of other galaxies

00:03:45.042 --> 00:03:49.184
that we've already mapped out
with large surveys of the sky?

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:51.434
How would their histories be different

00:03:51.458 --> 00:03:54.351
if the universe was made of something else

00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:57.476
or if there was more or less matter in it?

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.351
So the interesting thing
about these model universes

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:04.167
is that they allow us
to test these possibilities.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.667
Let's go back to the first
moment of the universe --

00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:16.333
just a fraction of a second
after the big bang.

00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:19.809
In this first moment,

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:21.934
there was no matter at all.

00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:25.434
The universe was expanding very fast.

00:04:25.458 --> 00:04:28.226
And quantum mechanics tells us

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.976
that matter is being created and destroyed

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
all the time, in every moment.

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:36.643
At this time, the universe
was expanding so fast

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:39.917
that the matter that got created
couldn't get destroyed.

00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:45.643
And thus we think that all of the matter
was created during this time.

00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:47.851
Both the dark matter

00:04:47.875 --> 00:04:50.958
and the regular matter
that makes up you and me.

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:54.601
Now, let's go a little bit further

00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:57.101
to a time after the matter was created,

00:04:57.125 --> 00:04:59.434
after protons and neutrons formed,

00:04:59.458 --> 00:05:01.184
after hydrogen formed,

00:05:01.208 --> 00:05:05.226
about 400,000 years after the big bang.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.518
The universe was hot and dense
and really smooth

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:12.268
but not perfectly smooth.

00:05:12.292 --> 00:05:17.059
This image, taken with a space telescope
called the Planck satellite,

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:19.559
shows us the temperature of the universe

00:05:19.583 --> 00:05:20.958
in all directions.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.393
And what we see

00:05:23.417 --> 00:05:26.434
is that there were places
that were a little bit hotter

00:05:26.458 --> 00:05:28.851
and denser than others.

00:05:28.875 --> 00:05:30.559
The spots in this image

00:05:30.583 --> 00:05:35.500
represent places where there was
more or less mass in the early universe.

00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:40.458
Those spots got big because of gravity.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.934
The universe was expanding
and getting less dense overall

00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:49.643
over the last 13.8 billion years.

00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:52.518
But gravity worked hard in those spots

00:05:52.542 --> 00:05:54.684
where there was a little bit more mass

00:05:54.708 --> 00:05:59.018
and pulled more and more mass
into those regions.

00:05:59.042 --> 00:06:01.809
Now, all of this
is a little hard to imagine,

00:06:01.833 --> 00:06:05.184
so let me just show you
what I am talking about.

00:06:05.208 --> 00:06:08.768
Those computer models I mentioned
allow us to test these ideas,

00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:10.583
so let's take a look at one of them.

00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:14.559
This movie, made by my research group,

00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:18.792
shows us what happened to the universe
after its earliest moments.

00:06:20.375 --> 00:06:23.268
You see the universe
started out pretty smooth,

00:06:23.292 --> 00:06:24.726
but there were some regions

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.809
where there was
a little bit more material.

00:06:27.833 --> 00:06:31.059
Gravity turned on
and brought more and more mass

00:06:31.083 --> 00:06:35.125
into those spots that started out
with a little bit extra.

00:06:36.167 --> 00:06:37.601
Over time,

00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:40.476
you get enough stuff in one place

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.768
that the hydrogen gas,

00:06:41.792 --> 00:06:44.809
which was initially well mixed
with the dark matter,

00:06:44.833 --> 00:06:46.643
starts to separate from it,

00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:49.226
cool down, form stars,

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.684
and you get a small galaxy.

00:06:51.708 --> 00:06:54.726
Over time, over billions
and billions of years,

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.184
those small galaxies crash into each other

00:06:57.208 --> 00:07:00.226
and merge and grow
to become larger galaxies,

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.583
like our own galaxy, the Milky Way.

00:07:03.875 --> 00:07:07.458
Now, what happens
if you don't have dark matter?

00:07:08.292 --> 00:07:10.184
If you don't have dark matter,

00:07:10.208 --> 00:07:13.167
those spots never get clumpy enough.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.143
It turns out, you need at least
a million times the mass of the Sun

00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:20.809
in one dense region,

00:07:20.833 --> 00:07:23.351
before you can start forming stars.

00:07:23.375 --> 00:07:25.018
And without dark matter,

00:07:25.042 --> 00:07:28.809
you never get enough stuff in one place.

00:07:28.833 --> 00:07:33.434
So here, we're looking
at two universes, side by side.

00:07:33.458 --> 00:07:35.934
In one of them you can see

00:07:35.958 --> 00:07:38.976
that things get clumpy quickly.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.268
In that universe,

00:07:40.292 --> 00:07:42.625
it's really easy to form galaxies.

00:07:43.458 --> 00:07:44.934
In the other universe,

00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.476
the things that start out
like small clumps,

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.393
they just stay really small.

00:07:49.417 --> 00:07:51.518
Not very much happens.

00:07:51.542 --> 00:07:54.893
In that universe,
you wouldn't get our galaxy.

00:07:54.917 --> 00:07:56.601
Or any other galaxy.

00:07:56.625 --> 00:07:58.476
You wouldn't get the Milky Way,

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.309
you wouldn't get the Sun,

00:08:00.333 --> 00:08:02.059
you wouldn't get us.

00:08:02.083 --> 00:08:04.750
We just couldn't exist in that universe.

00:08:07.083 --> 00:08:10.393
OK, so this crazy stuff, dark matter,

00:08:10.417 --> 00:08:12.227
it's most of the mass in the universe,

00:08:12.251 --> 00:08:15.351
it's going through us right now,
we wouldn't be here without it.

00:08:15.375 --> 00:08:16.625
What is it?

00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:18.893
Well, we have no idea.

00:08:18.917 --> 00:08:20.292
(Laughter)

00:08:21.208 --> 00:08:24.268
But we have a lot of educated guesses,

00:08:24.292 --> 00:08:27.559
and a lot of ideas
for how to find out more.

00:08:27.583 --> 00:08:32.101
So, most physicists think
that dark matter is a particle,

00:08:32.125 --> 00:08:35.184
similar in many ways to the subatomic
particles that we know of,

00:08:35.208 --> 00:08:38.226
like protons and neutrons and electrons.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.518
Whatever it is,

00:08:39.542 --> 00:08:43.417
it behaves very similarly
with respect to gravity.

00:08:44.333 --> 00:08:47.518
But it doesn't emit or absorb light,

00:08:47.542 --> 00:08:49.476
and it goes right through normal matter,

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.292
as if it wasn't even there.

00:08:52.375 --> 00:08:54.768
We'd like to know what particle it is.

00:08:54.792 --> 00:08:57.268
For example, how heavy is it?

00:08:57.292 --> 00:09:02.351
Or, does anything at all happen
if it interacts with normal matter?

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:05.184
Physicists have lots of great ideas
for what it could be,

00:09:05.208 --> 00:09:07.226
they're very creative.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.059
But it's really hard,

00:09:09.083 --> 00:09:12.768
because those ideas span a huge range.

00:09:12.792 --> 00:09:16.018
It could be as small
as the smallest subatomic particles,

00:09:16.042 --> 00:09:19.625
or it could be as large
as the mass of 100 Suns.

00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:24.643
So, how do we figure out what it is?

00:09:24.667 --> 00:09:26.476
Well, physicists and astronomers

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.976
have a lot of ways
to look for dark matter.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.184
One of the things we're doing
is building sensitive detectors

00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:37.143
in deep underground mines,

00:09:37.167 --> 00:09:40.018
waiting for the possibility

00:09:40.042 --> 00:09:43.893
that a dark matter particle,
which goes through us and the Earth,

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:46.226
would hit a denser material

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.167
and leave behind
some trace of its passage.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.976
We're looking for dark matter in the sky,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.184
for the possibility
that dark matter particles

00:09:55.208 --> 00:09:56.601
would crash into each other

00:09:56.625 --> 00:09:59.601
and create high-energy light
that we could see

00:09:59.625 --> 00:10:02.601
with special gamma-ray telescopes.

00:10:02.625 --> 00:10:06.351
We're even trying to make
dark matter here on Earth,

00:10:06.375 --> 00:10:10.934
by smashing particles together
and looking for what happens,

00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:14.042
using the Large Hadron
Collider in Switzerland.

00:10:15.083 --> 00:10:17.268
Now, so far,

00:10:17.292 --> 00:10:20.559
all of these experiments
have taught us a lot

00:10:20.583 --> 00:10:22.226
about what dark matter isn't

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:23.434
(Laughter)

00:10:23.458 --> 00:10:25.000
but not yet what it is.

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:29.018
There were really good ideas
that dark matter could have been,

00:10:29.042 --> 00:10:31.101
that these experiments would have seen.

00:10:31.125 --> 00:10:32.518
And they didn't see them yet,

00:10:32.542 --> 00:10:35.333
so we have to keep looking
and thinking harder.

00:10:37.458 --> 00:10:42.268
Now, another way to get a clue
to what dark matter is

00:10:42.292 --> 00:10:44.559
is to study galaxies.

00:10:44.583 --> 00:10:46.018
We already talked about

00:10:46.042 --> 00:10:49.601
how our galaxy and many other galaxies
wouldn't even be here

00:10:49.625 --> 00:10:51.476
without dark matter.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.851
Those models also make predictions

00:10:53.875 --> 00:10:55.934
for many other things about galaxies:

00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:57.863
How they're distributed in the universe,

00:10:57.887 --> 00:10:59.143
how they move,

00:10:59.167 --> 00:11:01.184
how they evolve over time.

00:11:01.208 --> 00:11:06.018
And we can test those predictions
with observations of the sky.

00:11:06.042 --> 00:11:08.851
So let me just give you two examples

00:11:08.875 --> 00:11:12.125
of these kinds of measurements
we can make with galaxies.

00:11:13.208 --> 00:11:18.101
The first is that we can make
maps of the universe with galaxies.

00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:20.851
I am part of a survey
called the Dark Energy Survey,

00:11:20.875 --> 00:11:24.083
which has made the largest map
of the universe so far.

00:11:25.167 --> 00:11:30.601
We measured the positions and shapes
of 100 million galaxies

00:11:30.625 --> 00:11:32.917
over one-eighth of the sky.

00:11:34.458 --> 00:11:39.893
And this map is showing us all the matter
in this region of the sky,

00:11:39.917 --> 00:11:45.542
which is inferred by the light
distorted from these 100 million galaxies.

00:11:46.708 --> 00:11:49.768
The light distorted from all of the matter

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:53.000
that was between those galaxies and us.

00:11:54.333 --> 00:11:58.976
The gravity of the matter is strong enough
to bend the path of light.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.667
And it gives us this image.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:05.684
So these kinds of maps

00:12:05.708 --> 00:12:08.768
can tell us about how much
dark matter there is,

00:12:08.792 --> 00:12:11.059
they also tell us where it is

00:12:11.083 --> 00:12:13.000
and how it changes over time.

00:12:14.583 --> 00:12:18.768
So we're trying to learn
about what the universe is made of

00:12:18.792 --> 00:12:21.101
on the very largest scales.

00:12:21.125 --> 00:12:25.851
It turns out that the tiniest
galaxies in the universe

00:12:25.875 --> 00:12:29.018
provide some of the best clues.

00:12:29.042 --> 00:12:30.292
So why is that?

00:12:31.375 --> 00:12:34.809
Here are two example simulated universes

00:12:34.833 --> 00:12:37.434
with two different kinds of dark matter.

00:12:37.458 --> 00:12:39.684
Both of these pictures
are showing you a region

00:12:39.708 --> 00:12:42.601
around a galaxy like the Milky Way.

00:12:42.625 --> 00:12:45.601
And you can see that there's a lot
of other material around it,

00:12:45.625 --> 00:12:47.309
little small clumps.

00:12:47.333 --> 00:12:49.518
Now, in the image on the right,

00:12:49.542 --> 00:12:54.726
dark matter particles are moving slower
than they are in the one on the left.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:57.851
If those dark matter particles
are moving really fast,

00:12:57.875 --> 00:13:00.684
then the gravity in small clumps
is not strong enough

00:13:00.708 --> 00:13:03.143
to slow those fast particles down.

00:13:03.167 --> 00:13:04.434
And they keep going.

00:13:04.458 --> 00:13:06.934
They never collapse
into these small clumps.

00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:11.726
So you end up with fewer of them
than in the universe on the right.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.684
If you don't have those small clumps,

00:13:13.708 --> 00:13:16.417
then you get fewer small galaxies.

00:13:18.208 --> 00:13:19.893
If you look up at the southern sky,

00:13:19.917 --> 00:13:23.268
you can actually see
two of these small galaxies,

00:13:23.292 --> 00:13:26.768
the largest of the small galaxies
that are orbiting our Milky Way,

00:13:26.792 --> 00:13:29.792
the Large Magellanic Cloud
and the Small Magellanic Cloud.

00:13:30.958 --> 00:13:32.226
In the last several years,

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.601
we have detected a whole bunch more
even smaller galaxies.

00:13:35.625 --> 00:13:37.434
This is an example of one of them

00:13:37.458 --> 00:13:40.393
that we detected
with the same dark energy survey

00:13:40.417 --> 00:13:43.518
that we used to make maps of the universe.

00:13:43.542 --> 00:13:45.768
These really small galaxies,

00:13:45.792 --> 00:13:47.750
some of them are extremely small.

00:13:48.458 --> 00:13:51.393
Some of them have as few
as a few hundred stars,

00:13:51.417 --> 00:13:55.059
compared to the few hundred
billion stars in our Milky Way.

00:13:55.083 --> 00:13:57.893
So that makes them really hard to find.

00:13:57.917 --> 00:13:59.809
But in the last decade,

00:13:59.833 --> 00:14:02.518
we've actually found
a whole bunch more of these.

00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:05.268
We now know of 60 of these tiny galaxies

00:14:05.292 --> 00:14:08.309
that are orbiting our own Milky Way.

00:14:08.333 --> 00:14:11.917
And these little guys
are a big clue to dark matter.

00:14:12.833 --> 00:14:16.643
Because just the existence
of these galaxies tells us

00:14:16.667 --> 00:14:19.476
that dark matter
can't be moving very fast,

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:23.417
and not much can be happening
when it runs into normal matter.

00:14:24.583 --> 00:14:26.018
In the next several years,

00:14:26.042 --> 00:14:29.708
we're going to make much more
precise maps of the sky.

00:14:31.292 --> 00:14:33.726
And those will help refine our movies

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.750
of the whole universe
and the entire galaxy.

00:14:37.708 --> 00:14:41.768
Physicists are also making new,
more sensitive experiments

00:14:41.792 --> 00:14:45.625
to try to catch some sign
of dark matter in their laboratories.

00:14:47.042 --> 00:14:50.309
Dark matter is still a huge mystery.

00:14:50.333 --> 00:14:53.583
But it's a really exciting time
to be working on it.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.101
We have really clear evidence it exists.

00:14:57.125 --> 00:14:59.518
From the scale of the smallest galaxies

00:14:59.542 --> 00:15:02.125
to the scale of the whole universe.

00:15:03.458 --> 00:15:06.958
Will we actually find it
and figure out what it is?

00:15:08.542 --> 00:15:10.309
I have no idea.

00:15:10.333 --> 00:15:13.268
But it's going to be
a lot of fun to find out.

00:15:13.292 --> 00:15:15.684
We have a lot of possibilities
for discovery,

00:15:15.708 --> 00:15:19.184
and we definitely will learn more
about what it is doing

00:15:19.208 --> 00:15:20.792
and about what it isn't.

00:15:21.833 --> 00:15:24.893
Regardless of whether we find
that particle anytime soon,

00:15:24.917 --> 00:15:26.643
I hope I have convinced you

00:15:26.667 --> 00:15:30.726
that this mystery is actually
really close to home.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:32.268
The search for dark matter

00:15:32.292 --> 00:15:35.601
may just be the key to a whole new
understanding of physics

00:15:35.625 --> 00:15:37.476
and our place in the universe.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.768
Thank you.

00:15:38.792 --> 00:15:42.542
(Applause)
