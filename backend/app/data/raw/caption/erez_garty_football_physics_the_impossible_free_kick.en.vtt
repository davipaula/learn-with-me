00:00:07.124 --> 00:00:11.328
In 1997, 
in a game between France and Brazil,

00:00:11.328 --> 00:00:14.387
a young Brazilian player
named Roberto Carlos

00:00:14.387 --> 00:00:17.502
set up for a 35 meter free kick.

00:00:17.502 --> 00:00:19.554
With no direct line to the goal,

00:00:19.554 --> 00:00:23.859
Carlos decided to attempt 
the seemingly impossible.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:27.068
His kick sent the ball flying
wide of the players,

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:30.960
but just before going out of bounds,
it hooked to the left

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.082
and soared into the goal.

00:00:33.082 --> 00:00:35.877
According to Newton's first law of motion,

00:00:35.877 --> 00:00:39.246
an object will move 
in the same direction and velocity

00:00:39.246 --> 00:00:42.077
until a force is applied on it.

00:00:42.077 --> 00:00:45.931
When Carlos kicked the ball,
he gave it direction and velocity,

00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:48.696
but what force made the ball swerve

00:00:48.696 --> 00:00:53.577
and score one of the most magnificent 
goals in the history of the sport?

00:00:53.577 --> 00:00:55.828
The trick was in the spin.

00:00:55.828 --> 00:00:59.515
Carlos placed his kick
at the lower right corner of the ball,

00:00:59.515 --> 00:01:05.142
sending it high and to the right,
but also rotating around its axis.

00:01:05.142 --> 00:01:08.223
The ball started its flight
in an apparently direct route,

00:01:08.223 --> 00:01:12.053
with air flowing on both sides
and slowing it down.

00:01:12.053 --> 00:01:16.989
On one side, the air moved in the opposite
direction to the ball's spin,

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:18.890
causing increased pressure,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.036
while on the other side, the air moved
in the same direction as the spin,

00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:26.114
creating an area of lower pressure.

00:01:26.114 --> 00:01:30.929
That difference made the ball curve
towards the lower pressure zone.

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.302
This phenomenon is called
the Magnus effect.

00:01:34.302 --> 00:01:37.673
This type of kick, 
often referred to as a banana kick,

00:01:37.673 --> 00:01:39.529
is attempted regularly,

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:43.581
and it is one of the elements
that makes the beautiful game beautiful.

00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:45.932
But curving the ball 
with the precision needed

00:01:45.932 --> 00:01:51.061
to both bend around the wall
and back into the goal is difficult.

00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:53.314
Too high and it soars over the goal.

00:01:53.314 --> 00:01:56.587
Too low and it hits the ground 
before curving.

00:01:56.587 --> 00:01:59.093
Too wide and it never reaches the goal.

00:01:59.093 --> 00:02:02.591
Not wide enough 
and the defenders intercept it.

00:02:02.591 --> 00:02:06.068
Too slow and it hooks too early,
or not at all.

00:02:06.068 --> 00:02:09.088
Too fast and it hooks too late.

00:02:09.088 --> 00:02:10.978
The same physics make it possible

00:02:10.978 --> 00:02:14.386
to score another 
apparently impossible goal,

00:02:14.386 --> 00:02:17.504
an unassisted corner kick.

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:21.032
The Magnus effect was first documented
by Sir Isaac Newton

00:02:21.032 --> 00:02:26.261
after he noticed it while playing a game
of tennis back in 1670.

00:02:26.261 --> 00:02:30.217
It also applies to golf balls,
frisbees and baseballs.

00:02:30.217 --> 00:02:33.138
In every case, the same thing happens.

00:02:33.138 --> 00:02:37.634
The ball's spin creates a pressure 
differential in the surrounding air flow

00:02:37.634 --> 00:02:40.651
that curves it 
in the direction of the spin.

00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:41.972
And here's a question.

00:02:41.972 --> 00:02:44.448
Could you theoretically 
kick a ball hard enough

00:02:44.448 --> 00:02:48.292
to make it boomerang 
all the way around back to you?

00:02:48.292 --> 00:02:50.139
Sadly, no.

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:52.672
Even if the ball didn't 
disintegrate on impact,

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.311
or hit any obstacles,

00:02:54.311 --> 00:02:55.786
as the air slowed it,

00:02:55.786 --> 00:02:58.897
the angle of its deflection 
would increase,

00:02:58.897 --> 00:03:02.658
causing it to spiral into smaller 
and smaller circles

00:03:02.658 --> 00:03:05.287
until finally stopping.

00:03:05.287 --> 00:03:07.026
And just to get that spiral,

00:03:07.026 --> 00:03:11.103
you'd have to make the ball spin
over 15 times faster

00:03:11.103 --> 00:03:13.904
than Carlos's immortal kick.

00:03:13.904 --> 00:03:16.215
So good luck with that.
