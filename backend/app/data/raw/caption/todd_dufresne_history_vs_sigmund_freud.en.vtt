00:00:07.165 --> 00:00:10.345
Working in Vienna at the turn 
of the 20th century,

00:00:10.345 --> 00:00:12.975
he began his career as a neurologist

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:16.749
before pioneering the discipline 
of psychoanalysis.

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:20.749
He proposed that people are motivated 
by unconscious desires

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:22.439
and repressed memories,

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.399
and their problems can be addressed

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:28.399
by making those motivations conscious 
through talk therapy.

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:33.754
His influence towers above that of all 
other psychologists in the public eye.

00:00:33.754 --> 00:00:37.204
But was Sigmund Freud 
right about human nature?

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:39.984
And were his methods scientific?

00:00:39.984 --> 00:00:44.615
Order, order. 
Today on the stand we have… Dad?

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:46.820
Ahem, no, your honor.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.650
This is Doctor Sigmund Freud,

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.380
one of the most innovative thinkers
in the history of psychology.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.324
An egomaniac who propagated 
pseudoscientific theories.

00:00:56.324 --> 00:00:57.832
Well, which is it?

00:00:57.832 --> 00:01:01.292
He tackled issues medicine 
refused to address.

00:01:01.292 --> 00:01:03.668
Freud’s private practice treated women

00:01:03.668 --> 00:01:07.008
who suffered from what was called 
hysteria at the time,

00:01:07.008 --> 00:01:10.718
and their complaints hadn’t been taken
seriously at all.

00:01:10.718 --> 00:01:13.478
From the women with depression 
he treated initially

00:01:13.478 --> 00:01:16.468
to World War I veterans with PTSD,

00:01:16.468 --> 00:01:19.178
Freud’s talking cure worked,

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:23.470
and the visibility he gave his patients 
forced the medical establishment

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.762
to acknowledge their psychological 
disorders were real.

00:01:26.762 --> 00:01:29.222
He certainly didn’t help all his patients.

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:32.305
Freud was convinced
that our behavior is shaped by

00:01:32.305 --> 00:01:35.235
unconscious urges 
and repressed memories.

00:01:35.235 --> 00:01:39.473
He invented baseless unconscious 
or irrational drivers

00:01:39.473 --> 00:01:44.070
behind the behavior of trauma 
survivors— and caused real harm.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.950
How’s that?

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.710
He misrepresented some of his most 
famous case studies,

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.593
claiming his treatment had cured patients 
when in fact they had gotten worse.

00:01:53.593 --> 00:01:56.242
Later therapists influenced 
by his theories

00:01:56.242 --> 00:01:59.026
coaxed their patients into "recovering"

00:01:59.026 --> 00:02:03.669
supposedly repressed memories 
of childhood abuse that never happened.

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:06.309
Lives and families were torn apart.

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:09.749
You can’t blame Freud for later
misapplications of his work—

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:11.377
that would be projecting.

00:02:11.377 --> 00:02:15.402
Plenty of his ideas were harmful 
without any misapplication.

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:19.402
He viewed homosexuality 
as a developmental glitch.

00:02:19.402 --> 00:02:21.682
He coined the term penis envy—

00:02:21.682 --> 00:02:25.222
meaning women are haunted for life
by their lack of penises.

00:02:25.222 --> 00:02:27.832
Freud was a product of his era.

00:02:27.832 --> 00:02:29.902
Yes, some of the specifics were flawed,

00:02:29.902 --> 00:02:34.083
but he created a new space 
for future scientists to explore,

00:02:34.083 --> 00:02:36.323
investigate, and build upon.

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:39.733
Modern therapy techniques
that millions of people rely on

00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:43.026
came out of the work he started 
with psychoanalysis.

00:02:43.026 --> 00:02:46.196
And today everyone knows 
there’s an unconscious—

00:02:46.196 --> 00:02:48.916
that idea was popularized Freud.

00:02:48.916 --> 00:02:53.251
Psychologists today only believe 
in a “cognitive unconscious,”

00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:57.383
the fact that you aren’t aware 
of everything going on at a given moment.

00:02:57.383 --> 00:03:02.398
Freud took this idea way too far, 
ascribing deep meaning to everything.

00:03:02.398 --> 00:03:07.767
He built his theories on scientific ideas
that were outdated even in his own time,

00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:09.747
not just by today’s standards—

00:03:09.747 --> 00:03:12.687
for example, he thought 
individual psychology

00:03:12.687 --> 00:03:18.006
is derived from the biological inheritance
of events in ancient history.

00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:22.319
And I mean ancient—&nbsp;
like the Ice Age or the killing of Moses.

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.731
Freud and his closest allies actually 
believed these prehistorical traumas

00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:30.781
had ongoing impacts on human psychology.

00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:34.421
He thought that the phase 
of cold indifference to sexuality

00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:38.951
during pubescence was literally 
an echo of the Ice Age.

00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:43.349
With fantastical beliefs like these,
how can we take him seriously?

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.039
Any renowned thinker from centuries past

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:50.039
has ideas that seem fantastical 
by today’s standards,

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:53.751
but we can’t discount 
their influence on this basis.

00:03:53.751 --> 00:03:57.401
Freud was an innovator 
linking ideas across many fields.

00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:59.741
His concepts have become everyday terms

00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:04.386
that shape how we understand and talk 
about our own experiences.

00:04:04.386 --> 00:04:09.716
The Oedipus complex? Ego and id? 
Defense mechanisms? Death wishes?

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:10.586
All Freud.

00:04:10.586 --> 00:04:13.806
But Freud didn’t present himself as a 
social theorist—

00:04:13.806 --> 00:04:17.016
he insisted that his work was scientific.

00:04:17.016 --> 00:04:20.226
Are you saying he… repressed
inconvenient facts?

00:04:22.119 --> 00:04:24.959
Freud’s theories were unfalsifiable.

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:27.039
Wait, so you’re saying he was right?

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:32.849
No, his ideas were framed so that 
there’s no way to empirically verify them.

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:37.599
Freud didn’t even necessarily believe 
in the psychoanalysis he was peddling.

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.809
He was pessimistic 
about the impact of therapy.

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:43.619
What! I think I need to lie down!

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:47.689
Many of Sigmund Freud’s ideas 
don’t hold up to modern science,

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:52.054
and his clinical practices don’t meet 
today’s ethical standards.

00:04:52.054 --> 00:04:56.627
At the same time, he sparked 
a revolution in psychology and society,

00:04:56.627 --> 00:05:00.107
and created a vocabulary 
for discussing emotion.

00:05:00.107 --> 00:05:02.347
Freud made his share of mistakes.

00:05:02.347 --> 00:05:06.187
But is a thinker responsible 
for how subsequent generations

00:05:06.187 --> 00:05:08.127
put their ideas to use?

00:05:08.127 --> 00:05:11.417
Do they deserve the blame, 
credit, or redemption

00:05:11.417 --> 00:05:13.754
when we put history on trial?
