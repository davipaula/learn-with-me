00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:20.419
In case you didn't know,
2015 is the International Year of Light.

00:00:20.428 --> 00:00:22.841
So, I thought I'd tell you
just a little bit

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:25.501
about the impact of light on our health.

00:00:25.502 --> 00:00:29.781
My lab uses fruit flies
to study sleep and wake patterns,

00:00:29.782 --> 00:00:31.452
but what I want to talk today

00:00:31.453 --> 00:00:34.576
is primarily light
and its impact on health.

00:00:34.577 --> 00:00:36.892
So, of course, we live on this planet

00:00:36.893 --> 00:00:39.852
that spins around its axis
as it's orbiting the Sun.

00:00:39.853 --> 00:00:43.808
As a consequence of that,
one of the basic facts of life on Earth

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.507
is that you're exposed
to light-dark cycles every single day.

00:00:47.508 --> 00:00:51.318
Here you see the side of the Earth
that's facing the Sun, is light,

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:52.994
and the other one is dark,

00:00:52.995 --> 00:00:55.324
and actually, I think
we have so much light here

00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:58.902
that the dark side is kind of washed-out.

00:00:58.903 --> 00:01:01.112
But if the light was a little bit lower,

00:01:01.113 --> 00:01:06.799
you could see that there are lights
all over the places on Earth,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.005
at least where there's solid ground,
just not above water.

00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:13.163
And that's maybe a little bit
more clear from this picture

00:01:13.164 --> 00:01:18.986
which is a composite Google image
of Earth from above, at night,

00:01:18.987 --> 00:01:21.965
and I think that this is
a really stunning image.

00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:25.413
It's stunningly beautiful,
but it's also stunning to think

00:01:25.414 --> 00:01:28.949
about the amount of light
that we're enveloping the Earth on,

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.325
and, at the time of day when,

00:01:31.326 --> 00:01:34.365
for pretty much all
of our evolutionary history,

00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.104
the Earth has been dark.

00:01:36.105 --> 00:01:38.813
There's this funny story
that I don't know if it's true,

00:01:38.814 --> 00:01:42.144
but I like it, I think it's a good story,

00:01:42.145 --> 00:01:45.527
where in 1994, in LA,
police started getting reports

00:01:45.528 --> 00:01:48.673
of people seeing
a strange white cloud in the sky,

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:50.653
and they didn't know what this was.

00:01:50.654 --> 00:01:52.586
They wondered if they should be worried.

00:01:52.587 --> 00:01:55.746
It turned out LA had just suffered
a major earthquake

00:01:55.747 --> 00:01:58.658
which resulted in citywide blackouts.

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.982
So, many people
for the first time in many years,

00:02:01.983 --> 00:02:07.209
or perhaps the first time in their lives,
had an unobstructed view of the night sky.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.091
In fact, what they were seeing
was not a trail from some alien spaceship,

00:02:13.092 --> 00:02:17.567
but it was a glimpse of our own
home galaxy, the Milky Way.

00:02:17.568 --> 00:02:21.895
This may sound quite incredible to you
until I show you this next picture.

00:02:21.896 --> 00:02:25.208
Here's a picture that this guy,
Todd Carlson, from Canada,

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.878
took of his house,
a fairly typical-looking house,

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.280
a typical-looking sky,

00:02:30.281 --> 00:02:34.570
at least for those of us
living in Boston, or surrounding areas.

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:37.746
You can even make out
some stars in the sky.

00:02:37.747 --> 00:02:39.651
In 2003, there was a blackout

00:02:39.652 --> 00:02:42.401
that affected large parts
of the United States and Canada,

00:02:42.402 --> 00:02:46.067
and Todd Carlson lost his electricity,

00:02:46.068 --> 00:02:50.284
and he was smart enough to take a picture
of his house at that time,

00:02:50.285 --> 00:02:52.170
and this is what it looked like.

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:56.551
And again, here you can see this strange,
white cloud in the sky

00:02:56.552 --> 00:02:57.763
which is the Milky Way.

00:02:57.764 --> 00:03:01.777
The lights that we are producing
as humans, due to our ingenuity,

00:03:01.778 --> 00:03:07.111
are wiping out, basically, our view
of these millions of stars in the sky.

00:03:07.112 --> 00:03:11.210
So, if we think about that,
this is certainly a shame,

00:03:11.211 --> 00:03:14.698
because there are a few things
that are more magnificent

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:16.468
than a view of the night sky.

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:20.150
But we should also think about
what is this doing to our health

00:03:20.151 --> 00:03:24.571
if we're flooding ourselves
with this amount of light pollution?

00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:28.080
So I want to I tell you
that all throughout your bodies,

00:03:28.081 --> 00:03:30.964
in all of your organs,
you have biological clocks

00:03:30.965 --> 00:03:34.118
that keep you in sync
with the light-dark cycles

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:37.999
of your environment that result
from the Earth's rotation.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.181
And in your heads you have a master clock,

00:03:41.182 --> 00:03:44.580
a main clock that synchronizes
all of these other clocks in your bodies.

00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:49.467
The way that this works
is that light travels from a source,

00:03:49.468 --> 00:03:52.095
such as the Sun,
or an artificial light source,

00:03:52.096 --> 00:03:53.327
through your eyes,

00:03:53.328 --> 00:03:57.336
and that light information is then
conveyed to the brain, to the master clock

00:03:57.337 --> 00:04:02.496
that's in a part of your brain called
the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or the SCN.

00:04:02.497 --> 00:04:06.134
So in your eyes you of course have cells
that help you see the stars,

00:04:06.135 --> 00:04:08.126
that help you form visible imagery.

00:04:08.127 --> 00:04:12.706
But you also have cells that are not
a part of the visual-forming pathways,

00:04:12.707 --> 00:04:17.072
but rather their role
is to capture light information

00:04:17.072 --> 00:04:22.241
and basically convey it to the brain,
to tell the brain what time of day it is.

00:04:22.242 --> 00:04:24.797
So, how can I convince you
that you have this clock?

00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:27.536
Well, if I closed you in a dark room

00:04:27.537 --> 00:04:30.968
where you would have
no external source of light,

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:33.858
no alarm clocks, no clocks of any kind,

00:04:33.859 --> 00:04:36.832
you would still retain
rhythmic sleep and wake patterns

00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:38.173
at least for a little while,

00:04:38.174 --> 00:04:41.093
because your clock was previously
trained to light-dark cycles

00:04:41.094 --> 00:04:47.636
and one of the main functions of the clock
is to regulate behavioral rhythmicity.

00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:50.532
This, of course, is not an experiment

00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:53.552
that many of you would be willing
to subject yourselves to,

00:04:53.553 --> 00:04:57.353
but, fortunately, there's an experiment
that most of us have participated in,

00:04:57.354 --> 00:04:59.890
which is traveling across time zones.

00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:01.628
So, I like this quote that says,

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:03.975
"When you travel from America to Europe,

00:05:03.976 --> 00:05:07.806
your soul takes about
three days longer to get there."

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:12.148
And I know this is certainly true
when I travel from here to Serbia,

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:13.787
my home country.

00:05:13.788 --> 00:05:17.387
It does take me several days
basically, to feel normal,

00:05:17.388 --> 00:05:21.782
to feel aligned with the population
that's living there.

00:05:21.783 --> 00:05:24.584
And this is because your clock
takes a few days

00:05:24.585 --> 00:05:26.596
to get realigned with this new schedule.

00:05:26.597 --> 00:05:29.357
And, if you think about this,
this makes sense, right?

00:05:29.358 --> 00:05:31.871
So, for pretty much all of our history,

00:05:31.872 --> 00:05:35.675
except for a blink of an eye,
in our evolutionary history,

00:05:35.676 --> 00:05:38.578
nobody had a way of hopping
from one continent to the other

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:40.927
in a matter of hours.

00:05:40.928 --> 00:05:44.959
We're changing time zones
so quickly, and in this case,

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.666
nature's not really keeping up
with what we are capable of doing.

00:05:50.667 --> 00:05:55.732
So, what is this clock? And why
is it important to think about light?

00:05:55.733 --> 00:06:00.611
The clock is a molecular oscillator,
the details here are not important at all,

00:06:00.612 --> 00:06:05.026
I don't want you to look at the names
of these things on the board,

00:06:05.027 --> 00:06:06.846
but I want to point out that the clock

00:06:06.847 --> 00:06:09.433
is essentially the same
in animals such as fruit flies,

00:06:09.434 --> 00:06:14.059
which my lab uses in our studies,
and in mammals like mice or humans.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.290
And the first glimpses of the clock,
the components of the clock,

00:06:17.291 --> 00:06:21.773
and the way that it ticks
were gained in the fly, actually.

00:06:22.323 --> 00:06:24.848
What I want to stress here

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:31.468
is that the clock is tuned by light.

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:35.736
Some of the components of this clock
are actually degraded,

00:06:35.737 --> 00:06:37.856
directly degraded by light.

00:06:37.857 --> 00:06:40.256
So, that results in the state of the clock

00:06:40.257 --> 00:06:43.039
essentially oscillating
throughout the day and night.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.039
You can imagine

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.453
if the composition of the clock,
if some of the components are degraded,

00:06:47.454 --> 00:06:50.496
the composition of the clock
will change between day and night.

00:06:50.497 --> 00:06:54.195
And then the outputs of the clock
between day and night will be different.

00:06:54.196 --> 00:06:58.735
So, for instance, during the day,
the state of your clock is such

00:06:58.736 --> 00:07:01.126
that you are suppressing
production of melatonin,

00:07:01.127 --> 00:07:03.416
which is the hormone
that helps you fall asleep,

00:07:03.417 --> 00:07:08.126
but also has other functions, such as
anti-cancer and antioxidant properties.

00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:10.520
So light. Let's talk
about blue light a little bit.

00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:15.146
When you're outside during the day,
you're, of course, exposed to sunlight

00:07:15.153 --> 00:07:18.242
which consists of
different wavelengths of light.

00:07:18.243 --> 00:07:21.365
But the one that's particularly
important is blue light,

00:07:21.366 --> 00:07:23.996
because of its effect on our clock.

00:07:23.997 --> 00:07:27.796
Blue light also directly
elevates your mood,

00:07:27.797 --> 00:07:30.147
it boosts your attention
and your alertness.

00:07:30.148 --> 00:07:32.591
So blue light during the day
is very, very good,

00:07:32.592 --> 00:07:38.949
and I'd say that most of us don't spend
enough time in a bright light outside.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:43.076
You should be for 30 to 60 minutes
outside in bright light,

00:07:43.077 --> 00:07:46.490
so put some sunscreen on and go outside.

00:07:46.491 --> 00:07:50.896
The flip side of this
is that when you come home at night

00:07:50.897 --> 00:07:53.750
I would dare guess
that pretty much none of us

00:07:53.751 --> 00:07:56.966
spend the rest of the day
when we come home, in darkness,

00:07:56.967 --> 00:08:00.923
and we're not in tune with
the natural light and dark cycles, right?

00:08:00.924 --> 00:08:06.812
So, what we do normally is we use
our computers, smartphones, tablets;

00:08:06.813 --> 00:08:10.945
we are in rooms
that have high amounts of LED light.

00:08:10.946 --> 00:08:12.898
And, in particular, what's really bad

00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:16.492
is that these devices
are very, very rich in blue light.

00:08:16.493 --> 00:08:20.763
So, what you're doing, every evening,
when you're using these devices

00:08:20.764 --> 00:08:24.933
is you're essentially tricking your clock
into thinking that it's still day.

00:08:24.934 --> 00:08:27.728
And since the clock during day
and blue light

00:08:27.729 --> 00:08:30.048
suppress melatonin production,

00:08:30.049 --> 00:08:31.962
you're essentially doing that at night.

00:08:31.963 --> 00:08:35.725
Now, I'm not naive enough to suggest
you never use your computer at night,

00:08:35.726 --> 00:08:39.282
I know I wouldn't abide by that.

00:08:39.283 --> 00:08:41.017
But one thing that you can do,

00:08:41.018 --> 00:08:43.889
is you can turn the brightness
of your screen in the evening,

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.946
you can download programs
that filter some of the blue light

00:08:46.947 --> 00:08:51.538
or you can use glasses
that block some of the blue light.

00:08:52.688 --> 00:08:58.027
I have a little bit of news for you
that maybe you'll perceive as bad,

00:08:58.028 --> 00:08:59.751
but I think it's actually very good,

00:08:59.752 --> 00:09:02.791
which is that you are
very much like these guys.

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:06.533
So, this is a close-up of a fruit fly,

00:09:06.534 --> 00:09:09.722
and you may not like if I tell you
that you are like these guys.

00:09:09.723 --> 00:09:12.403
But think about it for a second,
this is very good for us

00:09:12.404 --> 00:09:15.638
because now we can use
these animals as a model system

00:09:15.639 --> 00:09:19.102
to understand more about sleep biology,

00:09:19.103 --> 00:09:21.902
and how light influences
our clock and our health,

00:09:21.903 --> 00:09:23.687
and this is what my lab is doing.

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:26.695
So, they sleep just like we do,
they sleep at night.

00:09:26.696 --> 00:09:29.702
If we deprive them of sleep,
then they crash the next day

00:09:29.703 --> 00:09:32.025
during the time
they would normally be active.

00:09:32.026 --> 00:09:36.093
If we deprive them of sleep
for a long time, they die;

00:09:36.094 --> 00:09:39.693
so sleep is very important for them.

00:09:39.694 --> 00:09:44.059
The same genes that regulate sleep
in humans regulate sleep in flies.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.928
And when they're asleep
they're disconnected,

00:09:47.929 --> 00:09:52.053
at least to a large degree, disconnected
from their environment, just like we are.

00:09:52.054 --> 00:09:55.672
So, if these guys are sleeping,
you need a stronger intensity stimulus

00:09:55.673 --> 00:09:58.102
to get them to react
than when they're awake.

00:09:58.103 --> 00:10:01.344
So same thing that happens to you
of course, when you're asleep.

00:10:01.345 --> 00:10:04.417
Two people in my lab:
a postdoc, Iris Titos Vivancos

00:10:04.418 --> 00:10:07.043
and a PhD student, Michelle Frank,

00:10:07.075 --> 00:10:11.794
are asking exactly what is this barrier
that's established in the brain

00:10:11.795 --> 00:10:16.455
that prevents sensor information
from coming through during sleep?

00:10:16.456 --> 00:10:21.207
How can your same physical brain exist
in two fundamentally different states?

00:10:21.208 --> 00:10:24.669
So now we're engaged, for instance,
here I'm speaking to you,

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.873
I'm engaged, I'm aware of you,
of my surroundings,

00:10:27.874 --> 00:10:29.373
I'm aware of my internal state;

00:10:29.374 --> 00:10:34.349
but tonight when I go to sleep,
I will be in a completely different state.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.304
And another thing that we're asking

00:10:36.305 --> 00:10:39.904
which is relevant
to what I talked about, to light,

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:44.735
is how light coming through the eye
is regulating sleep and wake patterns?

00:10:44.751 --> 00:10:49.186
A PhD student in my lab, Bryan Song,
is asking exactly this,

00:10:49.187 --> 00:10:51.432
What Bryan can do is, he can--

00:10:51.433 --> 00:10:57.279
you can see that flies have these big eyes
that take up a large part of their head.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.660
What Bryan can do is he can actually
trick the cells in the eye

00:11:00.661 --> 00:11:04.414
into thinking they're seeing light,
even when they're not.

00:11:04.415 --> 00:11:08.279
And this results in animals
having trouble falling asleep,

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.832
so it takes them about an hour
and a half longer to fall asleep.

00:11:12.833 --> 00:11:16.428
You can imagine that now
we can use this as a model organism

00:11:16.429 --> 00:11:20.120
to understand what it is
that happens in the brain

00:11:20.121 --> 00:11:21.796
when it's getting light information

00:11:21.797 --> 00:11:28.213
and how this is interfacing
with sleep and wake centers in the brain.

00:11:28.214 --> 00:11:30.943
And so one final thing
I want to tell you is

00:11:30.944 --> 00:11:34.399
well, first I want you
to think again for a moment

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.789
about our evolutionary history.

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:41.021
We evolved without alarm clocks,

00:11:41.022 --> 00:11:44.899
without any external source of information
of the time of day,

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:49.373
and we've developed this way that keeps us
in sync with our environment.

00:11:49.374 --> 00:11:53.540
But what we're exposing
ourselves to every day now

00:11:53.541 --> 00:11:56.395
is very much interfering
with that natural system,

00:11:56.396 --> 00:11:58.693
and I think it's really
something to think about.

00:11:58.694 --> 00:12:04.803
So when people tell you that too much
light exposure at night is not good,

00:12:04.804 --> 00:12:06.821
unfortunately, they are actually right.

00:12:06.822 --> 00:12:10.240
And the last thing I want to say is
please support basic science,

00:12:10.241 --> 00:12:16.563
because this is important for all of us,
and this is the way forward, I think.

00:12:17.153 --> 00:12:18.527
