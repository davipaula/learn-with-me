00:00:21.745 --> 00:00:23.096
I want to ask you something:

00:00:23.096 --> 00:00:25.578
When was the last time 
you watched the stars?

00:00:25.578 --> 00:00:27.861
I know most people forget they exist

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.061
specially in this polluted city

00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:32.598
which is sometimes foggy,

00:00:32.598 --> 00:00:34.092
we never see them.

00:00:34.092 --> 00:00:36.436
But since I was a kid, 
maybe not that young,

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:38.120
maybe 12 or 13 years,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.481
I've been captivated by stars
and would watch them whenever possible.

00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:43.808
My dad gave me a small telescope

00:00:43.808 --> 00:00:46.806
by the time I was 14 and I spent hours

00:00:46.806 --> 00:00:48.965
watching planets and stars

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:50.349
and always wondering:

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:51.773
What is out there?

00:00:51.773 --> 00:00:54.747
Is there someone watching me back

00:00:54.747 --> 00:00:56.936
with a telescope, wondering 
what is out here?

00:00:57.508 --> 00:00:59.966
This allure went on for years

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.388
and at some point 
I decided to be an astronomer.

00:01:03.102 --> 00:01:05.820
In Mexico, in order to be an astronomer
you need to be a physicist.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.724
So I studied physics.

00:01:07.724 --> 00:01:10.618
I never got to be an astronomer,
now I'm something in between,

00:01:10.893 --> 00:01:13.203
half an astrophysicist, half a physicist

00:01:13.203 --> 00:01:14.837
but this idea of stars

00:01:14.837 --> 00:01:16.848
and the possibility of reaching them

00:01:16.848 --> 00:01:18.251
remained with me.

00:01:18.584 --> 00:01:20.692
When I started my major in physics

00:01:20.692 --> 00:01:23.232
I realized something many of you

00:01:23.232 --> 00:01:26.065
have heard of, even if you are not 
totally clear about it:

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:30.564
that more than 100 years ago, in 1905,

00:01:30.564 --> 00:01:32.432
this guy named Albert Einstein,

00:01:32.432 --> 00:01:35.155
discovered that light speed

00:01:35.155 --> 00:01:37.792
is the fastest in the universe.

00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:39.187
That might not say you a lot

00:01:39.187 --> 00:01:41.400
because light speed is huge.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.583
Light moves up to 186,000 mi/s

00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:47.657
so high a speed that we can phone call

00:01:47.657 --> 00:01:49.837
someone in India or Japan

00:01:49.837 --> 00:01:52.389
with no problem at all.

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:55.795
Even astronauts who went 
to the moon 40 years ago

00:01:56.825 --> 00:02:00.556
were interviewed and
the President could talk to them

00:02:00.556 --> 00:02:03.834
with no evident delay

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:06.331
even though the astronauts 
were in the moon,

00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:09.473
thing is that light speed is huge

00:02:09.473 --> 00:02:12.592
and the universe gigantic.

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.376
We cannot travel faster than light speed

00:02:16.376 --> 00:02:18.231
and that is a severe problem

00:02:18.231 --> 00:02:20.589
to reach for the stars.

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:23.354
Sun is 8 light-minutes away,

00:02:23.354 --> 00:02:25.707
that is, it takes 8 minutes for light

00:02:25.707 --> 00:02:28.382
to get here from the Sun,
from the Sun to us.

00:02:28.382 --> 00:02:29.988
If the Sun exploded right now,

00:02:29.988 --> 00:02:32.273
nobody would notice 
up until eight minutes later.

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.677
The closest star after the Sun

00:02:35.677 --> 00:02:37.779
is Alfa Centauri,

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:40.138
it takes four years for light to travel

00:02:40.138 --> 00:02:41.626
and it's right besides the Sun.

00:02:42.057 --> 00:02:43.483
We live in a galaxy

00:02:43.493 --> 00:02:46.487
that is a star spiral called Milky Way.

00:02:46.487 --> 00:02:49.662
The center of our galaxy 
was 30,000 light years away,

00:02:49.662 --> 00:02:52.160
it takes 30,000 light years 
for light to travel

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.765
from the center of the galaxy to us,

00:02:54.765 --> 00:02:56.582
and two million years

00:02:56.582 --> 00:02:58.495
in traveling from Andromeda galaxy

00:02:58.495 --> 00:03:01.464
that is one of our neighbor galaxies.

00:03:01.624 --> 00:03:04.254
The universe is huge, vast,

00:03:04.254 --> 00:03:06.732
if we ever want to reach the stars

00:03:06.732 --> 00:03:09.583
the light limit is very serious,

00:03:09.583 --> 00:03:11.973
a very serious problem, but why?

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.913
Why we cannot travel faster than light?

00:03:14.923 --> 00:03:16.901
And it's not because Einstein said so,

00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:18.767
that is no how science works.

00:03:18.767 --> 00:03:21.053
In science 
there is no authority principle;

00:03:21.053 --> 00:03:23.116
it's not because some famous guy says so.

00:03:23.623 --> 00:03:25.635
There are reasons, theoretical reasons,

00:03:25.635 --> 00:03:27.715
observational reasons,

00:03:27.715 --> 00:03:29.413
experiments show it,

00:03:29.413 --> 00:03:32.592
it is a verified fact,

00:03:32.592 --> 00:03:33.971
but why?

00:03:34.285 --> 00:03:38.384
Basically, the answer is that 
theory of relativity prevents it,

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:40.179
so I will tell you a bit,

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:42.489
a very quick course:

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.612
Relativity in a couple of minutes.

00:03:45.612 --> 00:03:48.625
Don't be afraid, 
I'll give a general overview,

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:51.992
normally it takes six months to teach this

00:03:51.992 --> 00:03:54.561
to sixth and seventh graders 
of physics major.

00:03:54.561 --> 00:03:56.854
So right now I will explain it

00:03:56.854 --> 00:03:59.276
in two minutes and for non-physicists.

00:03:59.276 --> 00:04:01.036
So, don't worry.

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.036
Relativity is an old concept

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:07.428
though it wasn't called like that.

00:04:07.428 --> 00:04:10.951
The concept can be traced 
back from Galileo Galilei

00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:14.252
around 1620, in the 17th century.

00:04:14.667 --> 00:04:17.939
Galileo was the first one 
to realize something interesting,

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:20.224
when it comes to movement, when I move,

00:04:20.224 --> 00:04:23.342
my movement is always relative 
to something else.

00:04:23.342 --> 00:04:25.491
Movement is said to be relative,

00:04:25.491 --> 00:04:28.834
here on the stage,
my movement is relative to the floor.

00:04:29.088 --> 00:04:32.401
The measurement of your car speed 
is relative to the street,

00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:35.433
actually planes speed measurement

00:04:35.433 --> 00:04:37.648
is made relative to the air, 
not the floor.

00:04:37.648 --> 00:04:40.349
You might have noticed this
while watching a movie.

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:42.781
A plane speed measurement 
is relative to the air,

00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:45.579
and the Earth spins around the Sun, etc.

00:04:45.859 --> 00:04:48.206
If you were somewhere in space

00:04:48.206 --> 00:04:51.663
in the middle of nowhere 
it would be useless

00:04:51.663 --> 00:04:53.914
to ask if you are moving or not

00:04:53.914 --> 00:04:57.681
because there is no reference 
to compare your position,

00:04:57.681 --> 00:05:00.071
so movement is relative,
speeds are relative,

00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:03.163
because they are always measured
in relation to something else.

00:05:03.163 --> 00:05:06.461
This was discovered
by Galileo 400 years ago.

00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:08.341
That was an interesting fact

00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:10.859
for all physic studies made after Galileo.

00:05:10.859 --> 00:05:14.679
Newton and all great advances 
of the 18th and 19th centuries

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:16.626
agreed with Galileo.

00:05:16.626 --> 00:05:19.695
Speed is relative, that's fine,

00:05:19.695 --> 00:05:22.092
speeds aren't absolute.

00:05:22.092 --> 00:05:25.091
But by the end of 19th century 
something strange happened,

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:28.323
many physicists studying light

00:05:28.323 --> 00:05:30.738
discovered that light is quite weird,

00:05:30.738 --> 00:05:33.653
light speed is indeed absolute

00:05:33.653 --> 00:05:36.078
and though Galileo stated
that speeds were relative,

00:05:36.078 --> 00:05:38.984
that's not the case of light,
it's always the same number

00:05:38.984 --> 00:05:40.488
no matter who measures it,

00:05:40.488 --> 00:05:43.477
or how fast is going whoever is measuring,

00:05:43.477 --> 00:05:46.644
no matter how fast the lightbulb 
sending out the light is moving.

00:05:46.644 --> 00:05:49.080
The measurement always 
yields the same number

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.115
and this was a problem.

00:05:51.115 --> 00:05:53.221
This might not seem interesting to you

00:05:53.221 --> 00:05:56.556
but physicists of the 19th 
century were going crazy.

00:05:56.983 --> 00:06:00.577
Problem was: either Galileo was wrong

00:06:00.577 --> 00:06:02.718
and speeds were indeed absolute,

00:06:02.718 --> 00:06:04.583
which was apparently nonsense;

00:06:04.583 --> 00:06:06.877
or those who were measuring light speed

00:06:06.877 --> 00:06:08.896
were wrong and didn't know how to measure.

00:06:08.896 --> 00:06:10.890
But nobody was wrong

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.340
which was even worst.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.658
Decades went by,

00:06:16.658 --> 00:06:20.151
until in 1905 this guy appeared,

00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:22.028
a man called Albert Einstein,

00:06:22.028 --> 00:06:24.705
who devoted his life to bringing together

00:06:24.705 --> 00:06:27.981
Galileo's idea that speeds were relative

00:06:27.981 --> 00:06:31.215
and the apparently real fact

00:06:31.215 --> 00:06:34.380
shown by the experiments, 
that there was an absolute speed,

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.011
light speed.

00:06:36.011 --> 00:06:37.822
Long story short,

00:06:37.822 --> 00:06:39.558
because math is complicated,

00:06:39.558 --> 00:06:41.321
part of Einstein genius

00:06:41.321 --> 00:06:43.954
was realizing there was a solution.

00:06:44.641 --> 00:06:47.193
There was a logical solution 
to the problem

00:06:48.276 --> 00:06:51.292
and that logical solution 
derived in what we now know

00:06:51.292 --> 00:06:54.388
as Einstein's theory of relativity.

00:06:54.388 --> 00:06:56.787
It's a very interesting theory 
that changes

00:06:56.787 --> 00:06:59.337
what we understand by space and time,

00:06:59.337 --> 00:07:02.469
for instance, nobody tells us 
that space is relative

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:04.809
distances, object lengths

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:08.200
depend on their movement;
if an object moves fast, they shrink.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.128
Time is also relative,

00:07:10.128 --> 00:07:13.086
any watch ticking relative 
to my movement, would delay

00:07:13.086 --> 00:07:15.245
this we have measured many times,

00:07:15.245 --> 00:07:19.190
even worst: simultaneity is relative;

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.896
when I say two things 
happen exactly at once,

00:07:21.896 --> 00:07:24.445
someone moving in relation to me
would disagree.

00:07:24.635 --> 00:07:27.834
One of us sees something first
and worst:

00:07:27.834 --> 00:07:30.011
we might be moving on opposed directions

00:07:30.011 --> 00:07:31.403
and watch things backwards:

00:07:31.403 --> 00:07:33.097
first this one, then that one.

00:07:33.097 --> 00:07:35.228
So the conclusion is that sometimes,

00:07:35.228 --> 00:07:37.805
the order in time of different things

00:07:37.805 --> 00:07:40.387
is not absolute, the order 
of time can change,

00:07:40.387 --> 00:07:42.721
one thing before, other thing after

00:07:42.721 --> 00:07:44.780
but this brings up another huge problem,

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.235
if time order is not well defined,
what about causality?

00:07:48.235 --> 00:07:50.352
If something causes something else

00:07:50.352 --> 00:07:52.312
that something should had happened first,

00:07:52.312 --> 00:07:54.977
but if we disagree on what happened first,

00:07:54.977 --> 00:07:57.695
where does that leaves causality?

00:07:57.695 --> 00:07:59.600
Another crisis.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.643
Part of what Einstein did

00:08:01.643 --> 00:08:03.714
was realizing that there was solution,

00:08:03.714 --> 00:08:06.512
a solution to protect causality

00:08:06.512 --> 00:08:09.545
was thinking that light speed 
is not absolute,

00:08:10.378 --> 00:08:14.915
but the maximum speed of universe.

00:08:14.915 --> 00:08:18.373
If nothing can travel faster than light
we protect causality.

00:08:18.663 --> 00:08:21.186
If something could travel 
faster than light

00:08:21.186 --> 00:08:24.340
then we could travel to the past,

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.142
we would be able to see 
the effect before the cause,

00:08:28.142 --> 00:08:30.163
which is not the proper way.

00:08:30.163 --> 00:08:32.744
So light speed is the maximum speed

00:08:32.744 --> 00:08:35.001
and that is to protect causality.

00:08:35.302 --> 00:08:38.793
So far as of the beginning 
of the 20th century,

00:08:38.793 --> 00:08:40.467
light speed was the fastest

00:08:40.467 --> 00:08:43.207
and if that was all left to say,
my talk would be done

00:08:43.207 --> 00:08:44.910
and off we go.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.100
But, fortunately that's not the case.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.028
In 1916, Einstein developed 
a second theory,

00:08:50.028 --> 00:08:52.904
also called relativity and that's 
why people get confused

00:08:52.904 --> 00:08:55.208
this one is called general relativity,

00:08:55.208 --> 00:08:57.031
and it's a theory about gravity.

00:08:57.031 --> 00:08:59.228
Einstein tried to understand gravity,

00:08:59.228 --> 00:09:01.469
which we already understood 
a bit since Newton;

00:09:01.469 --> 00:09:03.125
but he noticed some problems,

00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:06.579
gravity was thought of 
by Newton as instantaneous,

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:09.930
if someone moved the Sun,
Earth would immediately react,

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.271
this would go against the fact that 
nothing can travel faster than light,

00:09:14.271 --> 00:09:17.649
so Einstein began to develop 
a new gravity theory,

00:09:17.649 --> 00:09:18.919
it took him 10 years,

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:22.522
an amazing achievement 
for someone as smart of Einstein,

00:09:22.522 --> 00:09:24.046
was based on a beautiful thing:

00:09:24.046 --> 00:09:27.054
the Equivalence Principle, 
also discovered by Galileo:

00:09:27.054 --> 00:09:30.142
all objects fall at the same speed

00:09:30.142 --> 00:09:33.330
if two things were dropped at once,
they would fall at the same time,

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.628
a bowling ball or a ping pong ball
would fall just the same,

00:09:36.628 --> 00:09:39.943
the heavier one does not fall faster,
in case you were wondering.

00:09:39.943 --> 00:09:42.056
That means, from another point of view,

00:09:42.353 --> 00:09:47.057
that the trajectory of an object 
when there is gravity,

00:09:47.057 --> 00:09:48.871
does not depend on the object.

00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:51.294
All objects follow the same trajectory

00:09:51.294 --> 00:09:53.500
curved trajectories, you've seen that,

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.989
I throw objects and they move 
in parables and ellipses

00:09:56.989 --> 00:10:00.652
but if those trajectories are curve 
and nondependent of the object

00:10:00.652 --> 00:10:03.826
then trajectory is a property of space,
but they are curve,

00:10:03.826 --> 00:10:05.573
then space must be curve.

00:10:05.573 --> 00:10:07.219
Einstein concluded

00:10:07.219 --> 00:10:09.923
that gravity is a space deformation.

00:10:09.923 --> 00:10:11.938
An interesting and beautiful thing,

00:10:11.938 --> 00:10:14.606
and what is beautiful about it
is that I can cheat,

00:10:14.886 --> 00:10:17.620
I can use space deformation

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.385
to cheat on Einstein himself,

00:10:19.385 --> 00:10:22.068
so I use Einstein to cheat on Einstein.

00:10:22.068 --> 00:10:25.271
I can imagine ways to distort space

00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:29.317
to work around the statement
"nothing can go faster than light"

00:10:29.317 --> 00:10:32.500
and, technically, I could 
reach a faraway star

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.736
and then come back in time for dinner.

00:10:34.736 --> 00:10:38.452
I will share with you two possibilities,

00:10:38.452 --> 00:10:41.414
that are allowed on Einstein theory,

00:10:41.414 --> 00:10:42.636
one is beautiful

00:10:42.636 --> 00:10:46.328
and its technical name
is Einstein-Rosen bridge,

00:10:46.328 --> 00:10:48.726
sounds technical because Einstein

00:10:48.726 --> 00:10:50.795
and another scientist called Rosen

00:10:50.795 --> 00:10:53.887
had this idea in 1935.

00:10:53.887 --> 00:10:57.077
But in literature and on sci-fi movies

00:10:57.077 --> 00:10:58.793
it is called a Wormhole.

00:10:58.793 --> 00:11:02.104
If you like science fiction
then you might have seen it recently,

00:11:02.104 --> 00:11:04.371
in the movie Interstellar.

00:11:04.371 --> 00:11:07.952
On the movie, they travel 
through a wormhole.

00:11:07.952 --> 00:11:09.782
A wormhole is like a tunnel,

00:11:09.782 --> 00:11:13.677
I enter here and I end up
in Alpha Centauri,

00:11:13.677 --> 00:11:15.589
but traveling a shorter distance,

00:11:15.589 --> 00:11:17.885
like a shortcut in space.

00:11:17.885 --> 00:11:19.018
These structures --

00:11:19.018 --> 00:11:22.553
here is a beautiful diagram
of a wormhole in two dimensions --

00:11:22.933 --> 00:11:26.101
are allowed by the Einstein's theory,

00:11:26.101 --> 00:11:28.905
because this theory allows these tunnels,

00:11:28.905 --> 00:11:30.700
one thing is that the theory allows it

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.119
and another is having
an idea of how to do that.

00:11:33.119 --> 00:11:36.115
Nobody knows how to make a wormhole,

00:11:36.115 --> 00:11:38.760
but at least theory allows it.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.017
Another idea,
and I'll let you think about it,

00:11:42.017 --> 00:11:45.370
another idea is that it is not necessary
to make holes in space,

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.415
an idea that thought by some guy
not so long ago,

00:11:48.415 --> 00:11:51.221
in 1994, this guy on the picture,

00:11:52.286 --> 00:11:55.289
and the idea is different;
instead of making holes in space

00:11:55.289 --> 00:11:57.341
let's use another property of space.

00:11:57.341 --> 00:12:01.748
Space can bended, twisted and expanded,

00:12:01.748 --> 00:12:05.208
maybe you heard about 
how universe expands,

00:12:05.208 --> 00:12:07.406
galaxies move away from one another

00:12:07.406 --> 00:12:10.649
not because they are
drifting away from a center

00:12:10.649 --> 00:12:12.663
where an explosion occurred, no.

00:12:12.952 --> 00:12:16.100
The way we understand it in physics 
is that galaxies are still,

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.105
and what is growing bigger is space;
space is expanding.

00:12:20.856 --> 00:12:23.484
So I can use this idea in a small scale.

00:12:24.254 --> 00:12:26.784
Imagine I'm standing here and somehow

00:12:26.784 --> 00:12:29.229
I can expand the space behind me.

00:12:29.229 --> 00:12:31.292
I would start to drift away
from that wall,

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:34.190
and if at the same time
I shrink the space in front of me

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:36.494
I would become closer
to the wall in front of me.

00:12:36.494 --> 00:12:39.357
If I combine
the expansion and contraction,

00:12:39.357 --> 00:12:42.087
I could move from here
to that wall without moving,

00:12:42.087 --> 00:12:44.350
because the space made all the moving.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:47.973
This is called warp drive 
or drive through distortion

00:12:48.841 --> 00:12:51.570
and it's another way 
to travel faster than light,

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.200
actually you could travel 
as fast as you wish.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.801
These are two ideas on how 
we could travel faster than light.

00:12:58.912 --> 00:13:01.333
But there is a price to pay.

00:13:01.333 --> 00:13:04.332
Such is life, whenever 
you find something cool

00:13:04.332 --> 00:13:05.721
it's too expensive.

00:13:05.721 --> 00:13:08.017
We have a similar case here:

00:13:08.615 --> 00:13:10.951
from those two ideas,

00:13:10.951 --> 00:13:13.554
both worm holes and warp propulsion

00:13:13.554 --> 00:13:16.095
require, whenever we do 
the math of something

00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:19.264
called negative energy, which might 
not be crystal clear for you,

00:13:19.264 --> 00:13:21.590
but remember what Einstein said:

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.348
"mass and energy are equivalent",
the same thing.

00:13:24.348 --> 00:13:27.354
Remember nuclear reactors 
and atomic bombs,

00:13:27.354 --> 00:13:29.095
mass and energy are the same.

00:13:29.095 --> 00:13:32.574
So negative energy equals negative mass,

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.798
and I'd never went to buy 
minus 9 pounds of tortilla.

00:13:38.211 --> 00:13:40.213
There are no negative masses,

00:13:40.213 --> 00:13:42.791
without negative masses 
there are no negative energies

00:13:42.791 --> 00:13:46.063
and without negative energies
none of this is possible,

00:13:46.063 --> 00:13:48.043
No holes in space-time,

00:13:48.043 --> 00:13:50.422
no warp propulsion,

00:13:50.422 --> 00:13:51.589
and that's a problem.

00:13:51.589 --> 00:13:53.846
Negative energy is not forbidden,

00:13:53.846 --> 00:13:56.043
physics laws don't forbid it,

00:13:56.043 --> 00:13:57.743
but we've never seen it.

00:13:57.743 --> 00:14:00.544
It's one of those things
that simply do not exist.

00:14:01.449 --> 00:14:04.763
So, with this initial question:

00:14:04.763 --> 00:14:06.705
Can we travel faster than light?

00:14:06.705 --> 00:14:09.830
will we someday travel the stars 
and get back in time for dinner?

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:13.131
In 1905 Einstein told us 
it was not possible,

00:14:13.131 --> 00:14:15.497
that light speed was a limit,

00:14:15.497 --> 00:14:17.798
but sometimes, 
using Einstein's other theory,

00:14:17.798 --> 00:14:20.890
general relativity, we can cheat 
and bend the space,

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:23.154
expand it, compress it, make holes on it,

00:14:23.154 --> 00:14:25.541
and travel faster than light,

00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:27.068
however, the price of it

00:14:27.068 --> 00:14:29.696
is finding energies or negative masses,

00:14:29.696 --> 00:14:31.774
though they might not exist.

00:14:31.774 --> 00:14:33.488
So we are a bit stuck,

00:14:33.488 --> 00:14:36.882
but such is science 
and that's part of my message,

00:14:36.882 --> 00:14:39.462
science moves forward by making questions,

00:14:39.462 --> 00:14:41.864
and sometimes we find answers,

00:14:41.864 --> 00:14:44.690
sometimes we find answers we don't like,

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:48.083
that aren't what we wanted,
but universe is not how we want it.

00:14:48.089 --> 00:14:50.149
It is what it is and we 
sometimes find out

00:14:50.149 --> 00:14:53.092
that we don't have enough information,

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:55.046
to answer the question,

00:14:55.046 --> 00:14:57.131
and that is our current situation.

00:14:57.131 --> 00:14:59.443
Currently, we do not have 
all the information.

00:14:59.443 --> 00:15:02.533
Luckily, in 20, 30 or 100 years 
someone will come

00:15:02.533 --> 00:15:05.570
and find the answer and tell us for once

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.179
if we can reach the stars 
faster than light speed.

00:15:09.179 --> 00:15:12.016
Before I go I will ask you 
to do something,

00:15:12.016 --> 00:15:15.840
tonight, if clouds allow it, please go out

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.889
and take a look of the stars

00:15:17.889 --> 00:15:19.831
and think, what is out there?

00:15:19.831 --> 00:15:20.934
Thank you so much.

00:15:20.934 --> 00:15:23.063
(Applause)
