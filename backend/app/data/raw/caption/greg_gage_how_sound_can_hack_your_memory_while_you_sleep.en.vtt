Greg Gage: Who wouldn't love
acing a geography exam,

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.320
remembering all the locations
of the countries on a map

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.960
or avoiding embarrassing situations
of suddenly forgetting the person's name

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.520
standing right in front of you.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.240
It turns out that memory,
like other muscles in the body,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.880
can be strengthened and enhanced.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.000
But instead of practicing
with flash cards,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.560
there may be an interesting way

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.760
that we can hack our memory
while we sleep.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.960
(Music)

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.400
Why do we sleep?

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.640
This has been a question asked
since the early days of civilization.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.920
And while we may not know
the exact answer,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.000
there are a number of really
good theories about why we need it.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.520
Sleep is when the brain transfers
short-term memories

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.040
experienced throughout the day

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.320
into long-term memories.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.540
This process is called
memory consolidation,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.860
and it's the memory consolidation theory
that has scientists wondering

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.000
if we can enhance
certain memories over others.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.440
There was a paper recently
in the journal "Science"

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.720
by Ken Paller and his colleagues
at Northwestern

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.720
that seemed to show that this may be true,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.200
and that piqued our curiosity.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.640
Joud has been working
on a DIY version of this task

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.880
to see if we can improve memories
through the use of sound in sleep.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.280
So Joud, how do you test if we can
improve our memories with sleep?

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.760
Joud Marâ€™i: We need a human subject.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.680
[Step 1: Play a game]

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.320
We have a memory game
that we have on an iPad,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.360
and then we make our subject
play this game

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.240
and remember the images
and where they appear on the screen.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.160
GG: So this is like a memory game
you used to play as a child,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.440
which picture was where.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.320
And we tie each picture
with a sound that represents it.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.920
JM: So, if you can see
a picture of a car, for example,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.600
and you would hear the car engine.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.800
(Car engine starting)

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.440
GG: Just before you go to sleep
we're going to test you.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.520
We're going to see how well
you remember where the pictures are.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.520
Every time you see the picture,
you're going to hear the sound.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.120
And now comes the experiment.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.620
You're going to go take a nap.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.650
[Step 2: Take a nap]

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.360
And while you're sleeping,
we're going to be recording your EEG.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.960
JM: And then we wait for them to go
into what's called the slow-wave sleep,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.920
which is the deepest phase of your sleep
where it's really hard for you to wake up.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.160
GG: OK, pause.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.000
So, here's some information on sleep.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.960
There are four stages:
we have lighter stages of sleep and REM,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.600
but what we're interested in
is called slow-wave sleep.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.880
And it gets its name
from the electrical signals

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.240
called Delta waves
that we record from the brain.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.640
This is the part of sleep
where scientists believe

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.480
that memory consolidation can happen.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.920
In this deep period of sleep,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.080
we're going to do something
that you don't know we're going to do.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.410
JM: Here's where the tricky part comes,
and we start playing our cues.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.360
(Car engine starting)

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.840
GG: Do you play all the cues?

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.480
JM: No. We only want to play half of them
to see if there's a difference.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.880
GG: So your hypothesis is

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.760
the one that they were listening to
while they're sleeping

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.240
they're going to do better at.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.520
JM: Yes, exactly.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.280
GG: When you wake back up
and play the game again,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.400
do you do better or worse
than before a nap?

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.720
What we found is that if we played you
a cue during your sleep,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.280
for example, a car --

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.360
You would remember
the position of that car

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.960
when you woke back up again.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.400
But if we didn't play you the cue
during the sleep,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.000
for example, a guitar,

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.280
you'd be less likely to remember
that guitar when you woke up.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.120
The memories that were cued
they remembered better

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.480
than the ones they weren't,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.000
even though they don't remember
hearing those sounds?

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.280
JM: Yes, we ask them.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.240
GG: We know they're sleeping,
they can't hear it, they wake up,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.840
they do better on those
than the ones you didn't play.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.680
GG: That's amazing.
JM: It's like magic.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.200
GG: Joud ran this experiment on 12 people
and the results were significant.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.680
It's not that you remember things better;
it's that you forget them less.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.560
I was a huge skeptic when I first heard
that you could do better at a memory test

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.320
just by playing sounds during sleep.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.080
But we replicated these experiments.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.440
The facts and memories we collect
throughout the day are very fragile,

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.360
and they are easily lost and forgotten.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.560
But by reactivating them during sleep,
even without us being aware,

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.080
it seems like we could make them
more stable and less prone to forgetting.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.360
That's pretty incredible.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.640
Our brains are still active
even when we're not.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.640
So if you're like me and a bit forgetful,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.400
perhaps a solution is a pair
of headphones and a soft couch.
