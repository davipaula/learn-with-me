00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.840
Who here is fascinated
by life under the sea?

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.336
Fantastic.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.920
Now, what did we just do?

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.576
Let's dissect this for a second.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.096
The simple action
of an individual raising a hand

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.960
led many others to do the same.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.216
Now, it's true that when individuals
in a social network

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.816
have common priorities,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.816
it's often beneficial to copy one another.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.696
Think back to grade school and dressing
like the cool kids made you "cool."

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.416
But copying behavior
is also common in wild animals.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.176
For example, some birds
copy the alarm calls of other birds

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.000
to spread information
about approaching predators.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.176
But could copying behavior in wild animals

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.840
affect entire ecosystems
that we humans depend on?

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.616
I was led to this question
while studying coral reefs,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.136
which support millions of people
through fisheries and tourism

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.736
here in Africa and around the world.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.016
But coral reefs depend on fish

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.120
that perform a critical job
by eating algae.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.896
Because if left unchecked,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.816
these algae can kill coral
and take over entire coral reefs,

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.440
a costly change that is difficult
or impossible to reverse.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.176
So to understand
how fish may prevent this,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.136
I spy on them

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.216
while they're eating algae,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.296
which can be difficult for them to do

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.136
in open parts of the reef
exposed to predators,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.936
some of which, on rare occasion,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.360
appear to realize I'm watching them.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.920
(Laughter)

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.336
So clearly, clearly, for reef fish,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.696
dining out can be scary.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.256
But I wanted to understand
how these fish do their job

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.856
in risky situations.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.136
So my colleagues and I
put massive video camera stands

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.496
in a coral reef

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.216
to remotely monitor entire feeding grounds

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.816
that produce a lot of algae

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.600
but are exposed to predators.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.696
And this perspective from above

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.216
shows us the feeding behavior
and precise movements

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.816
of many different fish,

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.480
shown here with colored dots.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.136
And by analyzing
thousands of fish movements

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.376
to and from feeding grounds,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.000
we discovered a pattern.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.336
These fish, despite being
from different species

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.176
and not swimming in schools,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.216
were copying one another,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.456
such that one fish entering
these dangerous feeding grounds

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.880
could lead many others to do the same.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.256
And fish stayed for longer
and ate more algae

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.296
when they were surrounded
by more feeding fish.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.256
Now, this could be happening

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.856
because even simple movements
by individual fish

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.856
can inadvertently communicate
vital information.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.856
For example, if even one fish
sees a predator and flees,

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.616
this can alert many others to danger.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.560
And a fish safely entering feeding grounds
can show others that the coast is clear.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.336
So it turns out that even when
these fish are different species,

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.976
they are connected within social networks

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
which can provide information
on when it's safe to eat.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.816
And our analyses indicate that fish simply
copying other fish in their social network

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.896
could account for over 60 percent
of the algae eaten by the fish community,

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.936
and thus could be critical
to the flow of energy and resources

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.960
through coral reef ecosystems.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.256
But these findings also suggest
that overfishing,

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.256
a common problem in coral reefs,

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.736
not only removes fish,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.816
but it could break up
the social network of remaining fish,

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.616
which may hide more and eat less algae

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.176
because they're missing
critical information.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.160
And this would make coral reefs
more vulnerable than we currently predict.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.376
So remarkably, fish social networks

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.296
allow the actions of one to spread to many

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.256
and could affect entire coral reefs,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.536
which feed millions of us

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.336
and support the global economy

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.840
for all of us.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.136
Now, our discovery
points us towards better ways

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.336
to sustainably manage coral reefs,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.936
but it also shows us,

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.136
we humans are not just affected
by the actions of other humans,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.055
but we could be affected
by the actions of individual fish

00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:33.856
on a distant coral reef

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.336
through their simple copying behavior.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.576
Thank you.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.320
(Applause)
