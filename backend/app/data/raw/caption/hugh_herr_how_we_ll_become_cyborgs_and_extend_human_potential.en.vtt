00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:15.574
I'm an MIT professor,

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:18.574
but I do not design buildings
or computer systems.

00:00:18.938 --> 00:00:21.415
Rather, I build body parts,

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:25.157
bionic legs that augment
human walking and running.

00:00:25.812 --> 00:00:28.745
In 1982, I was in
a mountain-climbing accident,

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.403
and both of my legs had to be amputated
due to tissue damage from frostbite.

00:00:33.245 --> 00:00:35.182
Here, you can see my legs:

00:00:35.206 --> 00:00:40.506
24 sensors, six microprocessors
and muscle-tendon-like actuators.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.399
I'm basically a bunch of nuts and bolts
from the knee down.

00:00:43.846 --> 00:00:46.202
But with this advanced bionic technology,

00:00:46.226 --> 00:00:48.468
I can skip, dance and run.

00:00:50.138 --> 00:00:51.182
(Applause)

00:00:51.206 --> 00:00:52.357
Thank you.

00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:54.991
(Applause)

00:00:55.015 --> 00:00:58.944
I'm a bionic man,
but I'm not yet a cyborg.

00:01:02.284 --> 00:01:05.086
When I think about moving my legs,

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.229
neural signals from
my central nervous system

00:01:08.253 --> 00:01:09.872
pass through my nerves

00:01:09.896 --> 00:01:13.007
and activate muscles
within my residual limbs.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.039
Artificial electrodes sense these signals,

00:01:18.063 --> 00:01:20.528
and small computers in the bionic limb

00:01:20.552 --> 00:01:24.575
decode my nerve pulses
into my intended movement patterns.

00:01:26.493 --> 00:01:28.394
Stated simply,

00:01:28.418 --> 00:01:29.749
when I think about moving,

00:01:29.773 --> 00:01:33.970
that command is communicated
to the synthetic part of my body.

00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:38.244
However, those computers can't input
information into my nervous system.

00:01:38.838 --> 00:01:41.727
When I touch and move my synthetic limbs,

00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:45.004
I do not experience normal
touch and movement sensations.

00:01:46.108 --> 00:01:50.144
If I were a cyborg and could feel my legs

00:01:51.255 --> 00:01:55.081
via small computers inputting information
into my nervous system,

00:01:55.105 --> 00:01:57.463
it would fundamentally change, I believe,

00:01:57.487 --> 00:02:00.231
my relationship to my synthetic body.

00:02:00.605 --> 00:02:02.430
Today, I can't feel my legs,

00:02:03.788 --> 00:02:04.970
and because of that,

00:02:04.994 --> 00:02:08.439
my legs are separate tools
from my mind and my body.

00:02:08.463 --> 00:02:09.845
They're not part of me.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.766
I believe that if I were a cyborg
and could feel my legs,

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.218
they would become
part of me, part of self.

00:02:17.923 --> 00:02:22.068
At MIT, we're thinking about
NeuroEmbodied Design.

00:02:22.092 --> 00:02:23.869
In this design process,

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.573
the designer designs human flesh and bone,
the biological body itself,

00:02:30.597 --> 00:02:35.534
along with synthetics to enhance
the bidirectional communication

00:02:35.558 --> 00:02:38.040
between the nervous system
and the built world.

00:02:39.406 --> 00:02:43.795
NeuroEmbodied Design is a methodology
to create cyborg function.

00:02:45.843 --> 00:02:50.194
In this design process,
designers contemplate a future

00:02:50.218 --> 00:02:53.369
in which technology
no longer compromises separate,

00:02:53.393 --> 00:02:56.321
lifeless tools from
our minds and our bodies,

00:02:56.345 --> 00:03:00.171
a future in which technology
has been carefully integrated

00:03:00.195 --> 00:03:01.766
within our nature,

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.965
a world in which
what is biological and what is not,

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.075
what is human and what is not,

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.156
what is nature and what is not

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.367
will be forever blurred.

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:14.867
That future will provide
humanity new bodies.

00:03:16.156 --> 00:03:18.895
NeuroEmbodied Design
will extend our nervous systems

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.593
into the synthetic world,

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:23.093
and the synthetic world into us,

00:03:23.117 --> 00:03:25.767
fundamentally changing who we are.

00:03:26.994 --> 00:03:30.048
By designing the biological body
to better communicate

00:03:30.072 --> 00:03:31.859
with the built design world,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.065
humanity will end disability
in this 21st century

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:39.639
and establish the scientific
and technological basis

00:03:39.663 --> 00:03:40.964
for human augmentation,

00:03:41.937 --> 00:03:46.394
extending human capability
beyond innate, physiological levels,

00:03:46.418 --> 00:03:49.544
cognitively, emotionally and physically.

00:03:50.218 --> 00:03:54.450
There are many ways
in which to build new bodies across scale,

00:03:54.474 --> 00:03:58.419
from the biomolecular
to the scale of tissues and organs.

00:03:58.443 --> 00:04:01.649
Today, I want to talk about
one area of NeuroEmbodied Design,

00:04:01.673 --> 00:04:05.737
in which the body's tissues
are manipulated and sculpted

00:04:05.761 --> 00:04:08.307
using surgical and regenerative processes.

00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:11.967
The current amputation paradigm

00:04:11.991 --> 00:04:16.058
hasn't changed fundamentally
since the US Civil War

00:04:16.082 --> 00:04:19.836
and has grown obsolete
in light of dramatic advancements

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.796
in actuators, control systems
and neural interfacing technologies.

00:04:25.058 --> 00:04:29.336
A major deficiency is the lack
of dynamic muscle interactions

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.502
for control and proprioception.

00:04:32.682 --> 00:04:34.532
What is proprioception?

00:04:34.556 --> 00:04:37.794
When you flex your ankle,
muscles in the front of your leg contract,

00:04:37.818 --> 00:04:40.794
simultaneously stretching muscles
in the back of your leg.

00:04:40.818 --> 00:04:43.303
The opposite happens
when you extend your ankle.

00:04:43.327 --> 00:04:45.559
Here, muscles in the back
of your leg contract,

00:04:45.583 --> 00:04:47.304
stretching muscles in the front.

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:49.304
When these muscles flex and extend,

00:04:49.328 --> 00:04:51.662
biological sensors
within the muscle tendons

00:04:51.686 --> 00:04:54.162
send information
through nerves to the brain.

00:04:54.186 --> 00:04:56.790
This is how we're able to feel
where our feet are

00:04:56.814 --> 00:04:59.360
without seeing them with our eyes.

00:05:00.186 --> 00:05:04.409
The current amputation paradigm
breaks these dynamic muscle relationships,

00:05:04.433 --> 00:05:08.529
and in so doing eliminates
normal proprioceptive sensations.

00:05:08.553 --> 00:05:11.292
Consequently, a standard artificial limb

00:05:11.316 --> 00:05:13.991
cannot feed back information
into the nervous system

00:05:14.015 --> 00:05:16.759
about where the prosthesis is in space.

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:19.940
The patient therefore
cannot sense and feel

00:05:19.964 --> 00:05:22.931
the positions and movements
of the prosthetic joint

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:25.050
without seeing it with their eyes.

00:05:26.153 --> 00:05:30.097
My legs were amputated
using this Civil War-era methodology.

00:05:30.626 --> 00:05:33.182
I can feel my feet,
I can feel them right now

00:05:33.206 --> 00:05:35.065
as a phantom awareness.

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:36.978
But when I try to move them, I cannot.

00:05:37.002 --> 00:05:39.748
It feels like they're stuck
inside rigid ski boots.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:41.886
To solve these problems,

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.948
at MIT, we invented the agonist-antagonist
myoneural interface,

00:05:46.972 --> 00:05:48.805
or AMI, for short.

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:52.463
The AMI is a method to connect nerves
within the residuum

00:05:52.487 --> 00:05:54.710
to an external, bionic prosthesis.

00:05:55.405 --> 00:05:58.500
How is the AMI designed,
and how does it work?

00:05:59.508 --> 00:06:03.017
The AMI comprises two muscles
that are surgically connected,

00:06:03.041 --> 00:06:05.358
an agonist linked to an antagonist.

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:08.708
When the agonist contracts
upon electrical activation,

00:06:08.732 --> 00:06:11.224
it stretches the antagonist.

00:06:11.248 --> 00:06:13.530
This muscle dynamic interaction

00:06:13.554 --> 00:06:16.586
causes biological sensors
within the muscle tendon

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.079
to send information through the nerve
to the central nervous system,

00:06:20.103 --> 00:06:24.707
relating information on the muscle
tendon's length, speed and force.

00:06:24.731 --> 00:06:27.049
This is how muscle tendon
proprioception works,

00:06:27.073 --> 00:06:29.716
and it's the primary way we, as humans,

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.866
can feel and sense the positions,
movements and forces on our limbs.

00:06:34.386 --> 00:06:35.688
When a limb is amputated,

00:06:35.712 --> 00:06:39.832
the surgeon connects these opposing
muscles within the residuum

00:06:39.856 --> 00:06:41.073
to create an AMI.

00:06:41.097 --> 00:06:44.190
Now, multiple AMI
constructs can be created

00:06:44.214 --> 00:06:48.175
for the control and sensation
of multiple prosthetic joints.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:51.597
Artificial electrodes are then placed
on each AMI muscle,

00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:55.272
and small computers within the bionic limb
decode those signals

00:06:55.296 --> 00:06:58.208
to control powerful motors
on the bionic limb.

00:06:58.933 --> 00:07:01.093
When the bionic limb moves,

00:07:01.117 --> 00:07:02.974
the AMI muscles move back and forth,

00:07:02.998 --> 00:07:05.190
sending signals through
the nerve to the brain,

00:07:05.214 --> 00:07:09.356
enabling a person wearing the prosthesis
to experience natural sensations

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.864
of positions and movements
of the prosthesis.

00:07:12.492 --> 00:07:16.626
Can these tissue-design principles
be used in an actual human being?

00:07:17.786 --> 00:07:21.595
A few years ago, my good friend
Jim Ewing -- of 34 years --

00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:23.341
reached out to me for help.

00:07:24.272 --> 00:07:26.328
Jim was in an a terrible
climbing accident.

00:07:26.352 --> 00:07:29.050
He fell 50 feet in the Cayman Islands

00:07:29.074 --> 00:07:32.272
when his rope failed to catch him
hitting the ground's surface.

00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:35.809
He suffered many, many injuries:

00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:39.047
punctured lungs and many broken bones.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.790
After his accident, he dreamed
of returning to his chosen sport

00:07:43.814 --> 00:07:45.118
of mountain climbing,

00:07:45.142 --> 00:07:47.019
but how might this be possible?

00:07:49.322 --> 00:07:51.544
The answer was Team Cyborg,

00:07:52.369 --> 00:07:55.608
a team of surgeons,
scientists and engineers

00:07:55.632 --> 00:08:00.474
assembled at MIT to rebuild Jim
back to his former climbing prowess.

00:08:00.498 --> 00:08:04.554
Team member Dr. Matthew Carty
amputated Jim's badly damaged leg

00:08:04.578 --> 00:08:06.690
at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston,

00:08:06.714 --> 00:08:08.786
using the AMI surgical procedure.

00:08:09.262 --> 00:08:12.667
Tendon pulleys were created
and attached to Jim's tibia bone

00:08:12.691 --> 00:08:14.730
to reconnect the opposing muscles.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.365
The AMI procedure
reestablished the neural link

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:21.264
between Jim's ankle-foot
muscles and his brain.

00:08:21.854 --> 00:08:24.418
When Jim moves his phantom limb,

00:08:24.442 --> 00:08:27.450
the reconnected muscles
move in dynamic pairs,

00:08:27.474 --> 00:08:31.911
causing signals of proprioception
to pass through nerves to the brain,

00:08:31.935 --> 00:08:35.555
so Jim experiences normal sensations
with ankle-foot positions and movements,

00:08:35.579 --> 00:08:36.895
even when blindfolded.

00:08:37.842 --> 00:08:41.279
Here's Jim at the MIT laboratory
after his surgeries.

00:08:41.303 --> 00:08:44.423
We electrically linked Jim's AMI muscles,
via the electrodes,

00:08:44.447 --> 00:08:45.605
to a bionic limb,

00:08:45.629 --> 00:08:48.390
and Jim quickly learned
how to move the bionic limb

00:08:48.414 --> 00:08:51.318
in four distinct ankle-foot
movement directions.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.063
We were excited by these results,
but then Jim stood up,

00:08:55.087 --> 00:08:57.953
and what occurred was truly remarkable.

00:08:57.977 --> 00:09:01.993
All the natural biomechanics
mediated by the central nervous system

00:09:02.017 --> 00:09:05.366
emerged via the synthetic limb

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:08.905
as an involuntary, reflexive action.

00:09:08.929 --> 00:09:12.826
All the intricacies of foot placement
during stair ascent --

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:16.348
(Applause)

00:09:16.372 --> 00:09:18.276
emerged before our eyes.

00:09:19.644 --> 00:09:21.469
Here's Jim descending steps,

00:09:21.493 --> 00:09:24.485
reaching with his bionic toe
to the next stair tread,

00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:27.025
automatically exhibiting natural motions

00:09:27.049 --> 00:09:29.841
without him even trying to move his limb.

00:09:29.865 --> 00:09:34.478
Because Jim's central nervous system
is receiving the proprioceptive signals,

00:09:34.502 --> 00:09:38.549
it knows exactly how to control
the synthetic limb in a natural way.

00:09:39.635 --> 00:09:45.222
Now, Jim moves and behaves
as if the synthetic limb is part of him.

00:09:45.746 --> 00:09:47.706
For example, one day in the lab,

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.826
he accidentally stepped
on a roll of electrical tape.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.477
Now, what do you do
when something's stuck to your shoe?

00:09:53.501 --> 00:09:56.112
You don't reach down like this;
it's way too awkward.

00:09:56.136 --> 00:09:57.430
Instead, you shake it off,

00:09:57.454 --> 00:09:59.279
and that's exactly what Jim did

00:09:59.303 --> 00:10:02.469
after being neurally connected to the limb
for just a few hours.

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:05.413
What was most interesting to me

00:10:05.437 --> 00:10:08.305
is what Jim was telling us
he was experiencing.

00:10:08.329 --> 00:10:11.654
He said, "The robot became part of me."

00:10:12.217 --> 00:10:16.003
Jim Ewing: The morning after the first
time I was attached to the robot,

00:10:16.027 --> 00:10:21.393
my daughter came downstairs
and asked me how it felt to be a cyborg,

00:10:21.417 --> 00:10:25.386
and my answer was
that I didn't feel like a cyborg.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:29.236
I felt like I had my leg,

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:33.981
and it wasn't that I was
attached to the robot

00:10:34.005 --> 00:10:36.626
so much as the robot was attached to me,

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.182
and the robot became part of me.

00:10:38.206 --> 00:10:40.697
It became my leg pretty quickly.

00:10:41.617 --> 00:10:42.768
Hugh Herr: Thank you.

00:10:42.792 --> 00:10:45.880
(Applause)

00:10:45.904 --> 00:10:49.277
By connecting Jim's
nervous system bidirectionally

00:10:49.301 --> 00:10:51.071
to his synthetic limb,

00:10:51.095 --> 00:10:54.019
neurological embodiment was achieved.

00:10:54.043 --> 00:10:59.520
I hypothesized that because Jim
can think and move his synthetic limb,

00:10:59.544 --> 00:11:03.854
and because he can feel those movements
within his nervous system,

00:11:03.878 --> 00:11:07.005
the prosthesis is no longer
a separate tool,

00:11:07.029 --> 00:11:11.425
but an integral part of Jim,
an integral part of his body.

00:11:12.108 --> 00:11:16.106
Because of this neurological embodiment,
Jim doesn't feel like a cyborg.

00:11:17.215 --> 00:11:19.432
He feels like he just has his leg back,

00:11:19.456 --> 00:11:21.003
that he has his body back.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:22.731
Now I'm often asked

00:11:22.755 --> 00:11:26.311
when I'm going to be neurally linked
to my synthetic limbs bidirectionally,

00:11:26.335 --> 00:11:28.119
when I'm going to become a cyborg.

00:11:28.143 --> 00:11:30.906
The truth is, I'm hesitant
to become a cyborg.

00:11:31.966 --> 00:11:35.173
Before my legs were amputated,
I was a terrible student.

00:11:35.197 --> 00:11:38.020
I got D's and often F's in school.

00:11:38.044 --> 00:11:40.773
Then, after my limbs were amputated,

00:11:40.797 --> 00:11:42.896
I suddenly became an MIT professor.

00:11:43.353 --> 00:11:45.520
(Laughter)

00:11:45.544 --> 00:11:49.266
(Applause)

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:53.767
Now I'm worried that once I'm neurally
connected to my limbs once again,

00:11:53.791 --> 00:11:57.481
my brain will remap
back to its not-so-bright self.

00:11:57.505 --> 00:11:58.807
(Laughter)

00:11:58.831 --> 00:12:02.902
But you know what, that's OK,
because at MIT, I already have tenure.

00:12:02.926 --> 00:12:04.554
(Laughter)

00:12:04.578 --> 00:12:07.443
(Applause)

00:12:07.467 --> 00:12:09.825
I believe the reach
of NeuroEmbodied Design

00:12:09.849 --> 00:12:12.706
will extend far beyond limb replacement

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.434
and will carry humanity into realms

00:12:15.458 --> 00:12:18.148
that fundamentally
redefine human potential.

00:12:18.866 --> 00:12:20.585
In this 21st century,

00:12:20.609 --> 00:12:25.046
designers will extend the nervous system
into powerfully strong exoskeletons

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:29.277
that humans can control
and feel with their minds.

00:12:30.139 --> 00:12:33.282
Muscles within the body
can be reconfigured

00:12:33.306 --> 00:12:36.219
for the control of powerful motors,

00:12:36.243 --> 00:12:40.347
and to feel and sense
exoskeletal movements,

00:12:40.371 --> 00:12:44.132
augmenting humans' strength,
jumping height and running speed.

00:12:44.807 --> 00:12:49.457
In this 21st century, I believe humans
will become superheroes.

00:12:50.313 --> 00:12:53.924
Humans may also extend their bodies

00:12:53.948 --> 00:12:56.939
into non-anthropomorphic
structures, such as wings,

00:12:57.805 --> 00:13:01.836
controlling and feeling each wing movement
within the nervous system.

00:13:02.716 --> 00:13:06.110
Leonardo da Vinci said,
"When once you have tasted flight,

00:13:06.134 --> 00:13:09.661
you will forever walk the earth
with your eyes turned skyward,

00:13:09.685 --> 00:13:14.351
for there you have been
and there you will always long to return."

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.530
During the twilight years of this century,

00:13:17.554 --> 00:13:21.784
I believe humans will be unrecognizable
in morphology and dynamics

00:13:21.808 --> 00:13:23.761
from what we are today.

00:13:23.785 --> 00:13:26.720
Humanity will take flight and soar.

00:13:27.695 --> 00:13:30.997
Jim Ewing fell to earth
and was badly broken,

00:13:31.021 --> 00:13:34.401
but his eyes turned skyward,
where he always longed to return.

00:13:35.281 --> 00:13:37.837
After his accident,
he not only dreamed to walk again,

00:13:37.861 --> 00:13:40.725
but also to return to his chosen sport
of mountain climbing.

00:13:41.657 --> 00:13:46.395
At MIT, Team Cyborg built Jim
a specialized limb for the vertical world,

00:13:46.419 --> 00:13:50.649
a brain-controlled leg with full position
and movement sensations.

00:13:52.065 --> 00:13:55.288
Using this technology,
Jim returned to the Cayman Islands,

00:13:55.312 --> 00:13:57.219
the site of his accident,

00:13:57.243 --> 00:14:01.251
rebuilt as a cyborg
to climb skyward once again.

00:14:01.275 --> 00:14:03.052
(Crashing waves)

00:14:27.727 --> 00:14:34.727
(Applause)

00:14:43.578 --> 00:14:44.729
Thank you.

00:14:44.753 --> 00:14:48.334
(Applause)

00:14:48.358 --> 00:14:51.819
Ladies and gentlemen, Jim Ewing,
the first cyborg rock climber.

00:14:51.843 --> 00:14:58.843
(Applause)
