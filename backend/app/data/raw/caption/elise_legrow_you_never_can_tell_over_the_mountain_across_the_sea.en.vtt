00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.320
(Music)

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.800
(Singing) It was a teenage wedding
and the old folks wished them well.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.680
You could see that Pierre
did truly love the mademoiselle.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.696
Oh,

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.640
and now the young monsieur and madame

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.000
have rung the chapel bell.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.816
C'est la vie, say the old folks,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.800
it goes to show you never can tell.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.240
No, no.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.280
They furnished off an apartment
with a two-room Roebuck sale.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.120
The coolerator was crammed
with TV dinners and ginger ale.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.176
Oh,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.616
but when Pierre found work,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.040
the little money comin' worked out well .

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.936
C'est la vie, say the old folks,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.080
it goes to show you never can tell.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.600
You never can tell.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.360
They bought a souped-up jitney,
was a cherry red '53.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.720
They drove it down to New Orleans
to celebrate their anniversary.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.576
Oh,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.056
it was there where Pierre

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.536
was wedded to the lovely mademoiselle.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.456
C'est la vie, say the old folks,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.376
it goes to show you never can tell.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.056
No, no,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.199
you never can tell.

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:22.536
No, no,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.440
you never can tell.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.200
You never can tell.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.216
You never can tell.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.936
No, no,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.880
you never can tell.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.600
(Applause and cheers)

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.976
Thank you.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.016
I recently had the tremendous opportunity
of searching for gold

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.616
in the vast mine of songs
released by Chess Records,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.616
a Chicago-based label that was really
very active in the '50s and '60s in the US

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.736
and that music spread all over the world.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.136
And the songs that I'm singing tonight

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.656
are from an album that I just put out
called, "Playing Chess,"

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.576
that pays homage to those songs.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.856
And these guys were really the innovators
of rock 'n' roll and soul and R&amp;B

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.560
as we now know it.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.240
(Applause)

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.616
(Music)

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.560
(Singing) Over the mountain,

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.760
across the sea,

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.296
there's a girl waiting,

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.680
she's waiting for ...

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.416
me.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.600
(Music)

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.256
Over the river,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.936
beyond every cloud,

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:16.120
she's passed the wind blowin' loud.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.296
Over the mountain,

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.696
a girl waits for me.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.320
(Music)

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.616
Tell the sands,

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.496
every blade of grass,

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.880
please tell the wind to let my love pass.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.056
Over the mountain,

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.840
a girl waits for me.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.136
Tell the moon up --

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.040
up in the sky.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.536
Tell all the birds that fly on by

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.520
that over and over the mountain ...

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.280
my love waits for me.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.696
Oh,

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:33.256
into each dark, starry night,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.936
oh, what a mystery

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.720
that's sealed so tight.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.896
Over the mountain,

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.760
a girl waits for me.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.056
Tell the moon up --

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.416
up in the sky.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.160
Tell the birds that fly by

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.400
that over and over the mountain

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:21.000
my love waits for me.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.880
Into each dark and starry night,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.936
oh, what a mystery

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.000
that's sealed so tight.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.976
Over the mountains,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.800
a girl waits for me.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.800
She waits for me.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.320
Oh, she waits for me.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.280
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.776
Oh,

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.360
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.816
Oh,

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.296
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,

00:07:19.406 --> 00:07:22.636
oh oh, oh oh.

00:07:26.473 --> 00:07:31.493
(Applause and cheers)
