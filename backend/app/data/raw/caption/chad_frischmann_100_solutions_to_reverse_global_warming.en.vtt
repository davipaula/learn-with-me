00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:14.856
Hello.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.616
I'd like to introduce you to a word
you may never have heard before,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.256
but you ought to know:

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.520
drawdown.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.880
Drawdown is a new way of thinking about
and acting on global warming.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.176
It's a goal for a future that we want,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.040
a future where reversing
global warming is possible.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.656
Drawdown is that point in time

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.096
when atmospheric concentrations
of greenhouse gases begin to decline

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.520
on a year-to-year basis.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.416
More simply, it's that point

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.680
when we take out more greenhouse gases
than we put into Earth's atmosphere.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.880
Now, I know we're all concerned
about climate change,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.736
but climate change is not the problem.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.456
Climate change is
the expression of the problem.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.200
It's the feedback of the system
of the planet telling us what's going on.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.056
The problem is global warming,

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.376
provoked by the increasing
concentrations of greenhouse gases

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.040
caused by human activity.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.456
So how do we solve the problem?

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.720
How do we begin the process
of reversing global warming?

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.896
The only way we know how is to draw down,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.456
to avoid putting greenhouse gases up

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.440
and to pull down what's already there.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.336
I know.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.560
Given the current situation,
it sounds impossible,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.880
but humanity already knows what to do.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.736
We have real, workable
technologies and practices

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.200
that can achieve drawdown.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.766
And it's already happening.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.856
What we need is
to accelerate implementation

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.896
and to change the discourse

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.400
from one of fear and confusion,
which only leads to apathy,

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.336
to one of understanding and possibility,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.160
and, therefore, opportunity.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.960
I work for an organization
called Project Drawdown.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.295
And for the last four years,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.176
together with a team of researchers
and writers from all over the world,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.576
we have mapped, measured and detailed

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.800
100 solutions to reversing global warming.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.456
Eighty already exist today,

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.320
and when taken together,
those 80 can achieve drawdown.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.776
And 20 are coming attractions,
solutions on the pipeline,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.736
and when they come online,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.520
will speed up our progress.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.656
These are solutions

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.616
that are viable, scalable
and financially feasible.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.760
And they do one or more of three things:

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.136
replace existing fossil fuel-based energy
generation with clean, renewable sources;

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.616
reduce consumption
through technological efficiency

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.880
and behavior change;

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.136
and to biosequester carbon
in our plants' biomass and soil

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.536
through a process
we all learn in grade school,

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.240
the magic of photosynthesis.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.016
It's through a combination
of these three mechanisms

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.800
that drawdown becomes possible.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.880
So how do we get there?

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.480
Well, here's the short answer.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.936
This is a list of the top 20 solutions
to reversing global warming.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.416
Now, I'll go into some detail,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.000
but take a few seconds
to look over the list.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.096
It's eclectic, I know,

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.416
from onshore wind turbines
to educating girls,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.000
from plant-rich diets
to rooftop solar technology.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.416
So let's break it down a little bit.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.576
To the right of the slide,
you'll see figures in gigatons,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.056
or billions of tons.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.376
That represents the total
equivalent carbon dioxide

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.136
reduced from the atmosphere

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.080
when the solution is implemented
globally over a 30-year period.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.216
Now, when we think
about climate solutions,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.176
we often think about
electricity generation.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.136
We think of renewable energy
as the most important set of solutions,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.816
and they are incredibly important.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.336
But the first thing
to notice about this list

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.800
is that only five of the top 20 solutions
relate to electricity.

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:35.056
What surprised us, honestly,

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.640
was that eight of the top 20
relate to the food system.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.496
The climate impact of food
may come as a surprise to many people,

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.576
but what these results show
is that the decisions we make every day

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.016
about the food we produce,
purchase and consume

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.856
are perhaps the most
important contributions

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.080
every individual can make
to reversing global warming.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.056
And how we manage land
is also very important.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.096
Protecting forests and wetlands

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.416
safeguards, expands
and creates new carbon sinks

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.456
that directly draw down carbon.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.240
This is how drawdown can happen.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.256
And when we take food
and land management together,

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.736
12 of the top 20 solutions
relate to how and why we use land.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.160
This fundamentally shifts
traditional thinking on climate solutions.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.096
But let's go to the top of the list,

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.056
because I think what's there
may also surprise you.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.560
The single most impactful solution,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.816
according to this analysis,
would be refrigeration management,

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.536
or properly managing and disposing of
hydrofluorocarbons, also known as HFCs,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.440
which are used by refrigerators
and air conditioners to cool the air.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.976
We did a great job
with the Montreal Protocol

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.256
to limit the production
of chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs,

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.296
because of their effect
on the ozone layer.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.896
But they were replaced by HFCs,

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.096
which are hundreds to thousands of times
more potent a greenhouse gas

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.320
than carbon dioxide.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.520
And that 90 gigatons reduced
is a conservative figure.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.896
If we were to account for the impact
of the Kigali agreement of 2016,

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.856
which calls for the phaseout
of hydrofluorocarbons

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.400
and replace them with
natural refrigerants, which exist today,

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.776
this number could increase to 120,
to nearly 200 gigatons

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.016
of avoided greenhouse gases.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.840
Maybe you're surprised, as we were.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.376
Now, before going into some details
of specific solutions,

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.000
you may be wondering
how we came to these calculations.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.056
Well, first of all,
we collected a lot of data,

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.496
and we used statistical analysis
to create ranges

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.496
that allow us to choose reasonable choices

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.880
for every input used
throughout the models.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.160
And we chose a conservative approach,
which underlies the entire project.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.136
All that data is entered in the model,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.296
ambitiously but plausibly
projected into the future,

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.797
and compared against
what we would have to do anyway.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.256
The 84 gigatons reduced
from onshore wind turbines, for example,

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.296
results from the electricity
generated from wind farms

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.280
that would otherwise be produced
from coal or gas-fired plants.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:32.256
We calculate all the costs
to build and to operate the plants

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.840
and all the emissions generated.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.640
The same process is used
to compare recycling versus landfilling,

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.176
regenerative versus
industrial agriculture,

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.280
protecting versus
cutting down our forests.

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.936
The results are then integrated
within and across systems

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.536
to avoid double-counting

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.920
and add it up to see
if we actually get to drawdown.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.960
OK, let's go into some specific solutions.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.160
Rooftop solar comes in ranked number 10.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.136
When we picture rooftop solar in our minds

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:15.200
we often envision a warehouse in Miami
covered in solar panels.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.456
But these are solutions that are relevant
in urban and rural settings,

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.496
high and low-income countries,

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.160
and they have cascading benefits.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.096
This is a family
on a straw island in Lake Titicaca

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.376
receiving their first solar panel.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.896
Before, kerosene was used
for cooking and lighting,

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.440
kerosene on a straw island.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.056
So by installing solar, this family
is not only helping to reduce emissions,

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.720
but providing safety
and security for their household.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.799
And tropical forests tell their own story.

00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:53.736
Protecting currently degraded
land in the tropics

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.336
and allowing natural regeneration to occur

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.600
is the number five solution
to reversing global warming.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.520
We can think of trees
as giant sticks of carbon.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.376
This is drawdown in action every year,

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.040
as carbon is removed from
the atmosphere through photosynthesis,

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.800
which converts carbon dioxide to plants'
biomass and soil organic carbon.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.096
And we need to rethink
how we produce our food

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.000
to make it more regenerative.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.416
There are many ways to do this,
and we researched over 13 of them,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.656
but these aren't new ways
of producing food.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.240
They have been practiced
for centuries, for generations.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.056
But they are increasingly displaced
by modern agriculture,

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:42.456
which promotes tillage, monocropping

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.776
and the use of synthetic fertilizers
and pesticides which degrade the land

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.600
and turn it into a net emitter
of greenhouse gases.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.176
Regenerative agriculture,
on the other hand,

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.896
restores soil health and productivity,

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.776
increases yield,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.496
improves water retention,

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.456
benefits smallholder farmers
and large farming operations alike

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.440
and brings carbon back to the land.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.776
It's a win-win-win-win-win.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.960
(Laughter)

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.960
And it's not just how we produce food,

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.416
but what we consume

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.960
that has a massive impact
on global warming.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.176
A plant-rich diet is not
a vegan or a vegetarian diet,

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.280
though I applaud any
who make those choices.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.536
It's a healthy diet
in terms of how much we consume,

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.280
and particularly
how much meat is consumed.

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.776
In the richer parts of the world,

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.000
we overconsume.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.336
However, low-income countries

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.896
show an insufficient
caloric and protein intake.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.616
That needs rebalancing,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.736
and it's in the rebalancing

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.376
that a plant-rich diet
becomes the number four solution

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.760
to reversing global warming.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.920
Moreover, approximately a third
of all food produced is not eaten,

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.840
and wasted food emits an astounding
eight percent of global greenhouse gases.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.896
We need to look
where across the supply chain

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.640
these losses and wastage occurs.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.176
In low-income countries,
after food leaves the farm,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.856
most food is wasted
early in the supply chain

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.120
due to infrastructure
and storage challenges.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.816
Food is not wasted by consumers
in low-income countries

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.760
which struggle to feed their population.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.936
In the developed world, instead,
after food leaves the farm,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.336
most food is wasted
at the end of the supply chain

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.816
by markets and consumers,

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.976
and wasted food ends up in the landfill

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.200
where it emits methane

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.120
as it decomposes.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.720
This is a consumer choice problem.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.880
It's not a technology issue.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.656
Preventing food waste from the beginning

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.080
is the number three solution.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.016
But here's the interesting thing.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.416
When we look at the food system as a whole

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.896
and we implement
all the production solutions

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.360
like regenerative agriculture,

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.376
and we adopt a plant-rich diet,

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.296
and we reduce food waste,

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:11.176
our research shows that we would produce
enough food on current farmland

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.216
to feed the world's growing population
a healthy, nutrient-rich diet

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.400
now until 2050 and beyond.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.360
That means we don't need
to cut down forests for food production.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.880
The solutions to reversing global warming
are the same solutions to food insecurity.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.400
Now, a solution that often
does not get talked enough about,

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.920
family planning.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.336
By providing men and women
the right to choose

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.376
when, how and if to raise a family

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.536
through reproductive
health clinics and education,

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.416
access to contraception

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.800
and freedom devoid of persecution

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.720
can reduce the estimated
global population by 2050.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.056
That reduced population
means reduced demand

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:05.360
for electricity, food, travel, buildings
and all other resources.

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.936
All the energy and emissions

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.376
that are used to produce
that higher demand

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.936
is reduced by providing
the basic human right

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.640
to choose when, how
and if to raise a family.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:23.080
But family planning cannot happen
without equal quality of education

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.320
to girls currently being denied access.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.576
Now, we've taken a small liberty here,

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:34.056
because the impact of universal education

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.056
and family planning resources

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.016
are so inextricably intertwined

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.200
that we chose to cut it
right down the middle.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.976
But taken together,
educating girls and family planning

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.256
is the number one solution
to reversing global warming,

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.880
reducing approximately 120 billion tons
of greenhouse gases.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.320
So is drawdown possible?

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.656
The answer is yes, it is possible,

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.400
but we need all 80 solutions.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.976
There are no silver bullets
or a subset of solutions

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.480
that are going to get us there.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.056
The top solutions would take us
far along the pathway,

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.280
but there's no such thing
as a small solution.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.280
We need all 80.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.366
But here's the great thing.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.576
We would want to implement these solutions

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.920
whether or not global warming
was even a problem,

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.840
because they have cascading benefits
to human and planetary well-being.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.520
Renewable electricity results in clean,
abundant access to energy for all.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.536
A plant-rich diet, reduced food waste

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.880
results in a healthy global population
with enough food and sustenance.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.960
Family planning and educating girls?

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.816
This is about human rights,

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.400
about gender equality.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.696
This is about economic improvement
and the freedom of choice.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.920
It's about justice.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.976
Regenerative agriculture, managed grazing,
agroforestry, silvopasture

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.936
restores soil health, benefits farmers

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.160
and brings carbon back to the land.

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.216
Protecting our ecosystems
also protects biodiversity

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.880
and safeguards planetary health

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.360
and the oxygen that we breathe.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.960
Its tangible benefits
to all species are incalculable.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:35.296
But one last point, because
I know it's probably on everybody's mind;

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.120
how much is this going to cost?

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:43.416
Well, we estimate
that to implement all 80 solutions

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:47.456
would cost about 29 trillion
dollars over 30 years.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.456
That's just about a trillion a year.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.416
Now, I know that sounds like a lot,

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:56.560
but we have to remember that
global GDP is over 80 trillion every year,

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.056
and the estimated savings
from implementing these solutions

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.696
is 74 trillion dollars,
over double the costs.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.400
That's a net savings
of 44 trillion dollars.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.320
So drawdown is possible.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.200
We can do it if we want to.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:21.760
It's not going to cost that much,
and the return on that investment is huge.

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.880
Here's the welcome surprise.

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.200
When we implement these solutions,

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.696
we shift the way we do business

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:36.616
from a system that is inherently
exploitative and extractive

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:41.200
to a new normal that is by nature
restorative and regenerative.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.136
We need to rethink our global goals,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.776
to move beyond sustainability

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.936
towards regeneration,

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.640
and along the way reverse global warming.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.656
Thank you.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.840
(Applause)
