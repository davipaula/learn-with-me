00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.739
The hoodie is an amazing object.

00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:19.668
It's one of those timeless objects
that we hardly think of,

00:00:19.693 --> 00:00:22.348
because they work so well
that they're part of our lives.

00:00:22.373 --> 00:00:24.343
We call them "humble masterpieces."

00:00:24.368 --> 00:00:25.588
[Small thing.]

00:00:25.623 --> 00:00:26.905
[Big idea.]

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.601
[Paola Antonelli on
the Hoodie]

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:33.976
The hoodie has been --
even if it was not called so --

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.842
it's been an icon throughout history
for good and for bad reasons.

00:00:38.286 --> 00:00:41.081
The earliest ones that we can trace

00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:43.684
are from ancient Greece and ancient Rome.

00:00:43.708 --> 00:00:45.720
The Middle Ages, you see a lot of monks

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:49.700
that were wearing garments
that were cape-like, with hoods attached,

00:00:49.724 --> 00:00:51.017
so therefore, "hoodies."

00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:53.951
Ladies in the 17th century
would wear hoodies

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:57.836
to kind of hide themselves
when they were going to meet their lovers.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.038
And then, of course,
there's the legend, there's fantasy.

00:01:01.062 --> 00:01:04.033
There's the image of the hoodie
connected to the grim reaper.

00:01:04.057 --> 00:01:07.120
There's the image of the hoodie
connected to the executioner.

00:01:07.144 --> 00:01:09.872
So there's the dark side of the hoodie.

00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:13.427
The modern incarnation of the hoodie --

00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:16.397
a garment that's made
usually of cotton jersey,

00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:19.441
that has a hood attached
with a drawstring;

00:01:19.465 --> 00:01:22.022
sometimes it has a marsupial pocket --

00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:26.325
was introduced in the 1930s
by Knickerbocker Knitting Company.

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:28.243
Now it's called Champion.

00:01:28.267 --> 00:01:30.435
It was meant to keep athletes warm.

00:01:31.448 --> 00:01:35.544
Of course, though, it was
such a functional, comfortable garment

00:01:35.568 --> 00:01:39.630
that it was very rapidly adopted
by workmen everywhere.

00:01:39.654 --> 00:01:43.723
And then, around the 1980s,
it also gets adopted

00:01:43.747 --> 00:01:47.085
by hip-hop and B-boys, skateboarders,

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:50.222
and it takes on this kind of
youth street culture.

00:01:50.246 --> 00:01:52.390
It was, at the same time,
super-comfortable,

00:01:52.414 --> 00:01:53.565
perfect for the streets

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:57.117
and also had that added value of anonymity

00:01:57.141 --> 00:01:58.384
when you needed it.

00:01:58.408 --> 00:02:00.062
And then we have Mark Zuckerberg,

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:04.938
who defies convention
of respectable attire for businesspeople.

00:02:04.962 --> 00:02:09.362
But interestingly, it's also a way to show
how power has changed.

00:02:09.386 --> 00:02:12.015
If you're wearing a two-piece suit,
you might be the bodyguard.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.737
The real powerful person is wearing
a hoodie with a T-shirt and jeans.

00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:20.993
It's easy to think of
the physical aspects of the hoodie.

00:02:21.017 --> 00:02:23.818
You can immediately think
of wearing the hood up,

00:02:23.842 --> 00:02:26.527
and you feel this warmth
and this protection,

00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:27.950
but at the same time,

00:02:27.974 --> 00:02:30.843
you can also feel
the psychological aspects of it.

00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:32.508
I mean, think of donning a hoodie,

00:02:32.532 --> 00:02:34.955
all of a sudden, you feel more protected,

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:39.727
you feel that you are in your own shell.

00:02:41.298 --> 00:02:45.011
We know very well what the hoodie
has come to signify

00:02:45.035 --> 00:02:47.624
in the past few years
in the United States.

00:02:47.648 --> 00:02:52.191
When Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old
African-American kid,

00:02:52.215 --> 00:02:55.887
was shot by a neighborhood vigilante,

00:02:55.911 --> 00:03:00.060
and Million Hoodie Marches happened
all over the United States,

00:03:00.084 --> 00:03:03.172
in which people wore hoodies
with the hood up

00:03:03.196 --> 00:03:06.345
and marched in the streets
against this kind of prejudice.

00:03:07.081 --> 00:03:08.986
It doesn't happen that often

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.811
for a garment to have
so much symbolism and history

00:03:13.835 --> 00:03:17.036
and that encompasses
so many different universes

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.632
as the hoodie.

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:20.187
So, like all garments,

00:03:20.211 --> 00:03:23.209
especially all truly utilitarian garments,

00:03:23.233 --> 00:03:25.626
it is very basic in its design.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.946
But at the same time,

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.620
it has a whole universe
of possibilities attached.
