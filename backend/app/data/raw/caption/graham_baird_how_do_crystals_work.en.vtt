00:00:06.886 --> 00:00:11.216
Deep beneath the geysers and hot springs 
of Yellowstone Caldera

00:00:11.216 --> 00:00:16.184
lies a magma chamber produced by a 
hot spot in the earth’s mantle.

00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:19.077
As the magma moves towards 
the Earth’s surface,

00:00:19.077 --> 00:00:23.337
it crystallizes to form young, 
hot igneous rocks.

00:00:23.337 --> 00:00:27.392
The heat from these rocks drives 
groundwater towards the surface.

00:00:27.392 --> 00:00:32.882
As the water cools, ions precipitate out 
as mineral crystals,

00:00:32.882 --> 00:00:36.876
including quartz crystals from silicon 
and oxygen,

00:00:36.876 --> 00:00:41.886
feldspar from potassium, aluminum, 
silicon, and oxygen,

00:00:41.886 --> 00:00:45.126
galena from lead and sulfur.

00:00:45.126 --> 00:00:47.736
Many of these crystals have signature 
shapes—

00:00:47.736 --> 00:00:52.856
take this cascade of pointed quartz, 
or this pile of galena cubes.

00:00:52.856 --> 00:00:57.321
But what causes them to grow into these
shapes again and again?

00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:00.013
Part of the answer lies in their atoms.

00:01:00.013 --> 00:01:04.933
Every crystal’s atoms are arranged 
in a highly organized, repeating pattern.

00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:08.508
This pattern is the defining 
feature of a crystal,

00:01:08.508 --> 00:01:10.518
and isn’t restricted to minerals—

00:01:10.518 --> 00:01:15.758
sand, ice, sugar, chocolate, ceramics, 
metals, DNA,

00:01:15.758 --> 00:01:19.679
and even some liquids have 
crystalline structures.

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.459
Each crystalline material’s atomic 
arrangement

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:25.699
falls into one of six different families:

00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:32.319
cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, 
monoclinic, triclinic, and hexagonal.

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:34.359
Given the appropriate conditions,

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:37.009
crystals will grow into geometric shapes

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.699
that reflect the arrangement 
of their atoms.

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:44.579
Take galena, which has a cubic structure 
composed of lead and sulfur atoms.

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.622
The relatively large lead atoms

00:01:46.622 --> 00:01:50.932
are arranged in a three-dimensional 
grid 90 degrees from one another,

00:01:50.932 --> 00:01:55.662
while the relatively small sulfur atoms 
fit neatly between them.

00:01:55.662 --> 00:02:00.174
As the crystal grows, locations like these
attract sulfur atoms,

00:02:00.174 --> 00:02:03.656
while lead will tend to 
bond to these places.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:07.096
Eventually, they will complete the grid 
of bonded atoms.

00:02:07.096 --> 00:02:11.236
This means the 90 degree grid pattern 
of galena’s crystalline structure

00:02:11.236 --> 00:02:14.593
is reflected in the visible 
shape of the crystal.

00:02:14.593 --> 00:02:17.973
Quartz, meanwhile, has a hexagonal 
crystalline structure.

00:02:17.973 --> 00:02:22.103
This means that on one plane its atoms 
are arranged in hexagons.

00:02:22.103 --> 00:02:27.564
In three dimensions, these hexagons are 
composed of many interlocking pyramids

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:31.794
made up of one silicon atom 
and four oxygen atoms.

00:02:31.794 --> 00:02:34.171
So the signature shape of a quartz 
crystal

00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:39.571
is a six-sided column with pointed tips.

00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:41.691
Depending on environmental conditions,

00:02:41.691 --> 00:02:46.111
most crystals have the potential to form
multiple geometric shapes.

00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:50.041
For example, diamonds, which form deep
in the Earth’s mantle,

00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:56.261
have a cubic crystalline structure and can
grow into either cubes or octahedrons.

00:02:56.261 --> 00:02:58.861
Which shape a particular 
diamond grows into

00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:01.151
depends on the conditions where it grows,

00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:05.451
including pressure, temperature, 
and chemical environment.

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:09.128
While we can’t directly observe growth 
conditions in the mantle,

00:03:09.128 --> 00:03:11.868
laboratory experiments have shown some
evidence

00:03:11.868 --> 00:03:15.838
that diamonds tend to grow into cubes at 
lower temperatures

00:03:15.838 --> 00:03:19.026
and octahedrons at higher temperatures.

00:03:19.026 --> 00:03:23.496
Trace amounts of water, silicon, 
germanium, or magnesium

00:03:23.496 --> 00:03:26.646
might also influence a diamond’s shape.

00:03:26.646 --> 00:03:31.256
And diamonds never naturally grow into the
shapes found in jewelry—

00:03:31.256 --> 00:03:36.474
those diamonds have been cut to 
showcase sparkle and clarity.

00:03:36.474 --> 00:03:41.621
Environmental conditions can also 
influence whether crystals form at all.

00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:44.126
Glass is made of melted quartz sand,

00:03:44.126 --> 00:03:45.686
but it isn’t crystalline.

00:03:45.686 --> 00:03:48.706
That’s because glass cools 
relatively quickly,

00:03:48.706 --> 00:03:51.646
and the atoms do not have time to arrange
themselves

00:03:51.646 --> 00:03:54.576
into the ordered structure 
of a quartz crystal.

00:03:54.576 --> 00:03:58.346
Instead, the random arrangement 
of the atoms in the melted glass

00:03:58.346 --> 00:04:00.906
is locked in upon cooling.

00:04:00.906 --> 00:04:03.546
Many crystals don’t form geometric shapes

00:04:03.546 --> 00:04:08.146
because they grow in extremely close 
quarters with other crystals.

00:04:08.146 --> 00:04:10.809
Rocks like granite are full of crystals,

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:13.379
but none have recognizable shapes.

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.539
As magma cools and solidifies,

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:21.249
many minerals within it crystallize at the
same time and quickly run out of space.

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:23.881
And certain crystals, like turquoise,

00:04:23.881 --> 00:04:28.891
don’t grow into any discernible geometric
shape in most environmental conditions,

00:04:28.891 --> 00:04:31.014
even given adequate space.

00:04:31.014 --> 00:04:34.204
Every crystal’s atomic structure has 
unique properties,

00:04:34.204 --> 00:04:39.134
and while these properties may not have
any bearing on human emotional needs,

00:04:39.134 --> 00:04:44.204
they do have powerful applications 
in materials science and medicine.
