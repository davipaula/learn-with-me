00:00:12.785 --> 00:00:14.489
Nine years ago,

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:17.614
my sister discovered lumps
in her neck and arm

00:00:17.638 --> 00:00:19.398
and was diagnosed with cancer.

00:00:20.985 --> 00:00:24.184
From that day, she started to benefit

00:00:24.208 --> 00:00:27.323
from the understanding
that science has of cancer.

00:00:28.206 --> 00:00:30.305
Every time she went to the doctor,

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.523
they measured specific molecules

00:00:32.547 --> 00:00:35.428
that gave them information
about how she was doing

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:36.761
and what to do next.

00:00:38.095 --> 00:00:41.761
New medical options
became available every few years.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.388
Everyone recognized
that she was struggling heroically

00:00:47.412 --> 00:00:49.140
with a biological illness.

00:00:50.847 --> 00:00:54.504
This spring, she received
an innovative new medical treatment

00:00:54.528 --> 00:00:55.730
in a clinical trial.

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:57.978
It dramatically knocked back her cancer.

00:00:59.446 --> 00:01:01.998
Guess who I'm going to spend
this Thanksgiving with?

00:01:02.022 --> 00:01:04.289
My vivacious sister,

00:01:04.313 --> 00:01:06.942
who gets more exercise than I do,

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.825
and who, like perhaps
many people in this room,

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:12.141
increasingly talks about a lethal illness

00:01:12.165 --> 00:01:13.428
in the past tense.

00:01:14.614 --> 00:01:18.477
Science can, in our lifetimes --
even in a decade --

00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:21.708
transform what it means
to have a specific illness.

00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:25.589
But not for all illnesses.

00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:31.097
My friend Robert and I
were classmates in graduate school.

00:01:31.121 --> 00:01:32.922
Robert was smart,

00:01:32.946 --> 00:01:34.423
but with each passing month,

00:01:34.447 --> 00:01:37.601
his thinking seemed to become
more disorganized.

00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:41.439
He dropped out of school,
got a job in a store ...

00:01:41.463 --> 00:01:43.681
But that, too, became too complicated.

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:47.504
Robert became fearful and withdrawn.

00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:50.662
A year and a half later,
he started hearing voices

00:01:50.686 --> 00:01:52.883
and believing that people
were following him.

00:01:52.907 --> 00:01:55.629
Doctors diagnosed him with schizophrenia,

00:01:55.653 --> 00:01:57.773
and they gave him
the best drug they could.

00:01:57.797 --> 00:02:00.805
That drug makes the voices
somewhat quieter,

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.818
but it didn't restore his bright mind
or his social connectedness.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.126
Robert struggled to remain connected

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.007
to the worlds of school
and work and friends.

00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:12.414
He drifted away,

00:02:12.438 --> 00:02:14.723
and today I don't know where to find him.

00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:17.072
If he watches this,

00:02:17.962 --> 00:02:19.590
I hope he'll find me.

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.746
Why does medicine have
so much to offer my sister,

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.750
and so much less to offer
millions of people like Robert?

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.242
The need is there.

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:37.419
The World Health Organization
estimates that brain illnesses

00:02:37.443 --> 00:02:41.558
like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder
and major depression

00:02:41.582 --> 00:02:46.553
are the world's largest cause
of lost years of life and work.

00:02:47.807 --> 00:02:51.368
That's in part because these illnesses
often strike early in life,

00:02:51.392 --> 00:02:53.573
in many ways, in the prime of life,

00:02:53.597 --> 00:02:58.061
just as people are finishing
their educations, starting careers,

00:02:58.085 --> 00:03:00.364
forming relationships and families.

00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:03.217
These illnesses can result in suicide;

00:03:03.907 --> 00:03:08.474
they often compromise one's ability
to work at one's full potential;

00:03:09.767 --> 00:03:13.222
and they're the cause of so many
tragedies harder to measure:

00:03:13.246 --> 00:03:15.684
lost relationships and connections,

00:03:15.708 --> 00:03:18.747
missed opportunities
to pursue dreams and ideas.

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:22.538
These illnesses limit human possibilities

00:03:22.562 --> 00:03:24.716
in ways we simply cannot measure.

00:03:27.493 --> 00:03:31.509
We live in an era in which
there's profound medical progress

00:03:31.533 --> 00:03:33.344
on so many other fronts.

00:03:33.368 --> 00:03:35.915
My sister's cancer story
is a great example,

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.001
and we could say the same
of heart disease.

00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:41.610
Drugs like statins will prevent
millions of heart attacks and strokes.

00:03:43.047 --> 00:03:45.992
When you look at these areas
of profound medical progress

00:03:46.016 --> 00:03:47.480
in our lifetimes,

00:03:47.504 --> 00:03:49.178
they have a narrative in common:

00:03:50.067 --> 00:03:54.615
scientists discovered molecules
that matter to an illness,

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:59.318
they developed ways to detect
and measure those molecules in the body,

00:04:00.492 --> 00:04:03.270
and they developed ways
to interfere with those molecules

00:04:03.294 --> 00:04:05.342
using other molecules -- medicines.

00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:09.941
It's a strategy that has worked
again and again and again.

00:04:11.403 --> 00:04:15.045
But when it comes to the brain,
that strategy has been limited,

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.671
because today, we don't know
nearly enough, yet,

00:04:19.695 --> 00:04:21.547
about how the brain works.

00:04:22.526 --> 00:04:26.792
We need to learn which of our cells
matter to each illness,

00:04:26.816 --> 00:04:30.386
and which molecules in those cells
matter to each illness.

00:04:31.058 --> 00:04:33.709
And that's the mission
I want to tell you about today.

00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:38.590
My lab develops technologies
with which we try to turn the brain

00:04:38.614 --> 00:04:40.314
into a big-data problem.

00:04:40.338 --> 00:04:43.874
You see, before I became a biologist,
I worked in computers and math,

00:04:43.898 --> 00:04:45.222
and I learned this lesson:

00:04:46.365 --> 00:04:50.549
wherever you can collect vast amounts
of the right kinds of data

00:04:50.573 --> 00:04:52.603
about the functioning of a system,

00:04:53.365 --> 00:04:56.983
you can use computers in powerful new ways

00:04:57.007 --> 00:05:00.232
to make sense of that system
and learn how it works.

00:05:00.256 --> 00:05:02.778
Today, big-data approaches
are transforming

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.285
ever-larger sectors of our economy,

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:08.595
and they could do the same
in biology and medicine, too.

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:11.176
But you have to have
the right kinds of data.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.459
You have to have data
about the right things.

00:05:13.917 --> 00:05:17.782
And that often requires
new technologies and ideas.

00:05:18.815 --> 00:05:22.309
And that is the mission that animates
the scientists in my lab.

00:05:23.251 --> 00:05:26.225
Today, I want to tell you
two short stories from our work.

00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:30.531
One fundamental obstacle we face

00:05:30.555 --> 00:05:33.215
in trying to turn the brain
into a big-data problem

00:05:33.946 --> 00:05:38.484
is that our brains are composed of
and built from billions of cells.

00:05:39.246 --> 00:05:43.105
And our cells are not generalists;
they're specialists.

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:45.218
Like humans at work,

00:05:45.242 --> 00:05:50.516
they specialize into thousands
of different cellular careers,

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.907
or cell types.

00:05:52.796 --> 00:05:55.367
In fact, each of
the cell types in our body

00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:57.269
could probably give a lively TED Talk

00:05:57.293 --> 00:05:58.835
about what it does at work.

00:06:00.422 --> 00:06:02.792
But as scientists,
we don't even know today

00:06:02.816 --> 00:06:04.723
how many cell types there are,

00:06:04.747 --> 00:06:08.024
and we don't know what the titles
of most of those talks would be.

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:14.779
Now, we know many
important things about cell types.

00:06:14.803 --> 00:06:17.554
They can differ dramatically
in size and shape.

00:06:17.578 --> 00:06:21.713
One will respond to a molecule
that the other doesn't respond to,

00:06:21.737 --> 00:06:23.531
they'll make different molecules.

00:06:23.555 --> 00:06:26.076
But science has largely
been reaching these insights

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.043
in an ad hoc way, one cell type at a time,

00:06:29.067 --> 00:06:30.553
one molecule at a time.

00:06:31.854 --> 00:06:36.585
We wanted to make it possible to learn
all of this quickly and systematically.

00:06:37.673 --> 00:06:39.421
Now, until recently, it was the case

00:06:39.445 --> 00:06:42.521
that if you wanted to inventory
all of the molecules

00:06:42.545 --> 00:06:45.470
in a part of the brain or any organ,

00:06:45.494 --> 00:06:49.448
you had to first grind it up
into a kind of cellular smoothie.

00:06:50.678 --> 00:06:51.908
But that's a problem.

00:06:52.737 --> 00:06:55.275
As soon as you've ground up the cells,

00:06:55.299 --> 00:06:58.810
you can only study the contents
of the average cell --

00:06:58.834 --> 00:07:00.429
not the individual cells.

00:07:01.182 --> 00:07:04.891
Imagine if you were trying to understand
how a big city like New York works,

00:07:04.915 --> 00:07:07.457
but you could only do so
by reviewing some statistics

00:07:07.481 --> 00:07:09.510
about the average resident of New York.

00:07:10.637 --> 00:07:12.616
Of course, you wouldn't learn very much,

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.640
because everything that's interesting
and important and exciting

00:07:15.664 --> 00:07:18.396
is in all the diversity
and the specializations.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.026
And the same thing is true of our cells.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.800
And we wanted to make it possible to study
the brain not as a cellular smoothie

00:07:25.824 --> 00:07:28.302
but as a cellular fruit salad,

00:07:28.326 --> 00:07:30.930
in which one could generate
data about and learn from

00:07:30.954 --> 00:07:32.792
each individual piece of fruit.

00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:36.971
So we developed
a technology for doing that.

00:07:36.995 --> 00:07:38.724
You're about to see a movie of it.

00:07:41.477 --> 00:07:45.505
Here we're packaging
tens of thousands of individual cells,

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:48.452
each into its own tiny water droplet

00:07:48.476 --> 00:07:50.687
for its own molecular analysis.

00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:56.044
When a cell lands in a droplet,
it's greeted by a tiny bead,

00:07:56.068 --> 00:07:59.762
and that bead delivers millions
of DNA bar code molecules.

00:08:01.115 --> 00:08:04.423
And each bead delivers
a different bar code sequence

00:08:04.447 --> 00:08:05.690
to a different cell.

00:08:06.884 --> 00:08:09.465
We incorporate the DNA bar codes

00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:12.547
into each cell's RNA molecules.

00:08:12.571 --> 00:08:15.407
Those are the molecular
transcripts it's making

00:08:15.431 --> 00:08:18.534
of the specific genes
that it's using to do its job.

00:08:19.383 --> 00:08:23.590
And then we sequence billions
of these combined molecules

00:08:24.532 --> 00:08:27.030
and use the sequences to tell us

00:08:27.054 --> 00:08:29.656
which cell and which gene

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.220
every molecule came from.

00:08:32.561 --> 00:08:35.853
We call this approach "Drop-seq,"
because we use droplets

00:08:35.877 --> 00:08:38.452
to separate the cells for analysis,

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:41.921
and we use DNA sequences
to tag and inventory

00:08:41.945 --> 00:08:43.433
and keep track of everything.

00:08:44.727 --> 00:08:46.703
And now, whenever we do an experiment,

00:08:46.727 --> 00:08:49.970
we analyze tens of thousands
of individual cells.

00:08:51.018 --> 00:08:53.642
And today in this area of science,

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:58.597
the challenge is increasingly
how to learn as much as we can

00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:00.493
as quickly as we can

00:09:00.517 --> 00:09:02.255
from these vast data sets.

00:09:04.914 --> 00:09:07.684
When we were developing Drop-seq,
people used to tell us,

00:09:07.708 --> 00:09:12.512
"Oh, this is going to make you guys
the go-to for every major brain project."

00:09:13.257 --> 00:09:14.801
That's not how we saw it.

00:09:14.825 --> 00:09:19.356
Science is best when everyone
is generating lots of exciting data.

00:09:20.197 --> 00:09:23.411
So we wrote a 25-page instruction book,

00:09:23.435 --> 00:09:28.013
with which any scientist could build
their own Drop-seq system from scratch.

00:09:28.037 --> 00:09:31.734
And that instruction book has been
downloaded from our lab website

00:09:31.758 --> 00:09:34.723
50,000 times in the past two years.

00:09:35.598 --> 00:09:38.650
We wrote software
that any scientist could use

00:09:38.674 --> 00:09:41.572
to analyze the data
from Drop-seq experiments,

00:09:41.596 --> 00:09:43.311
and that software is also free,

00:09:43.335 --> 00:09:47.723
and it's been downloaded from our website
30,000 times in the past two years.

00:09:48.328 --> 00:09:53.307
And hundreds of labs have written us
about discoveries that they've made

00:09:53.331 --> 00:09:54.774
using this approach.

00:09:54.798 --> 00:09:58.358
Today, this technology is being used
to make a human cell atlas.

00:09:58.382 --> 00:10:01.736
It will be an atlas of all
of the cell types in the human body

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.440
and the specific genes
that each cell type uses to do its job.

00:10:08.133 --> 00:10:11.009
Now I want to tell you about
a second challenge that we face

00:10:11.033 --> 00:10:13.481
in trying to turn the brain
into a big data problem.

00:10:13.505 --> 00:10:16.784
And that challenge is that
we'd like to learn from the brains

00:10:16.808 --> 00:10:19.252
of hundreds of thousands of living people.

00:10:19.998 --> 00:10:23.702
But our brains are not physically
accessible while we're living.

00:10:24.895 --> 00:10:28.855
But how can we discover molecular factors
if we can't hold the molecules?

00:10:30.352 --> 00:10:34.900
An answer comes from the fact that
the most informative molecules, proteins,

00:10:34.924 --> 00:10:36.706
are encoded in our DNA,

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:41.260
which has the recipes our cells follow
to make all of our proteins.

00:10:41.999 --> 00:10:46.945
And these recipes vary
from person to person to person

00:10:46.969 --> 00:10:50.311
in ways that cause the proteins
to vary from person to person

00:10:50.335 --> 00:10:52.122
in their precise sequence

00:10:52.146 --> 00:10:55.297
and in how much each cell type
makes of each protein.

00:10:56.441 --> 00:10:59.834
It's all encoded in our DNA,
and it's all genetics,

00:10:59.858 --> 00:11:02.675
but it's not the genetics
that we learned about in school.

00:11:03.572 --> 00:11:05.555
Do you remember big B, little b?

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.660
If you inherit big B, you get brown eyes?

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:10.308
It's simple.

00:11:11.451 --> 00:11:14.624
Very few traits are that simple.

00:11:15.232 --> 00:11:19.957
Even eye color is shaped by much more
than a single pigment molecule.

00:11:20.861 --> 00:11:25.111
And something as complex
as the function of our brains

00:11:25.135 --> 00:11:28.382
is shaped by the interaction
of thousands of genes.

00:11:28.406 --> 00:11:30.746
And each of these genes
varies meaningfully

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:32.608
from person to person to person,

00:11:32.632 --> 00:11:36.149
and each of us is a unique
combination of that variation.

00:11:37.419 --> 00:11:39.635
It's a big data opportunity.

00:11:40.214 --> 00:11:43.390
And today, it's increasingly
possible to make progress

00:11:43.414 --> 00:11:46.210
on a scale that was never possible before.

00:11:46.234 --> 00:11:48.639
People are contributing to genetic studies

00:11:48.663 --> 00:11:50.257
in record numbers,

00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:55.172
and scientists around the world
are sharing the data with one another

00:11:55.196 --> 00:11:56.767
to speed progress.

00:11:57.514 --> 00:12:00.753
I want to tell you a short story
about a discovery we recently made

00:12:00.777 --> 00:12:02.671
about the genetics of schizophrenia.

00:12:03.506 --> 00:12:08.102
It was made possible
by 50,000 people from 30 countries,

00:12:08.126 --> 00:12:12.826
who contributed their DNA
to genetic research on schizophrenia.

00:12:14.406 --> 00:12:16.502
It had been known for several years

00:12:16.526 --> 00:12:20.637
that the human genome's largest influence
on risk of schizophrenia

00:12:20.661 --> 00:12:22.463
comes from a part of the genome

00:12:22.487 --> 00:12:25.831
that encodes many of the molecules
in our immune system.

00:12:25.855 --> 00:12:28.889
But it wasn't clear which gene
was responsible.

00:12:29.746 --> 00:12:33.786
A scientist in my lab developed
a new way to analyze DNA with computers,

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.905
and he discovered something
very surprising.

00:12:36.929 --> 00:12:40.180
He found that a gene called
"complement component 4" --

00:12:40.204 --> 00:12:42.003
it's called "C4" for short --

00:12:43.036 --> 00:12:46.925
comes in dozens of different forms
in different people's genomes,

00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:50.146
and these different forms
make different amounts

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.412
of C4 protein in our brains.

00:12:52.957 --> 00:12:56.942
And he found that the more
C4 protein our genes make,

00:12:56.966 --> 00:12:59.078
the greater our risk for schizophrenia.

00:12:59.919 --> 00:13:04.826
Now, C4 is still just one risk factor
in a complex system.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.839
This isn't big B,

00:13:06.863 --> 00:13:10.420
but it's an insight about
a molecule that matters.

00:13:11.492 --> 00:13:15.129
Complement proteins like C4
were known for a long time

00:13:15.153 --> 00:13:17.106
for their roles in the immune system,

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.908
where they act as a kind of
molecular Post-it note

00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:21.512
that says, "Eat me."

00:13:22.475 --> 00:13:25.142
And that Post-it note
gets put on lots of debris

00:13:25.166 --> 00:13:27.523
and dead cells in our bodies

00:13:27.547 --> 00:13:30.037
and invites immune cells
to eliminate them.

00:13:30.779 --> 00:13:34.318
But two colleagues of mine found
that the C4 Post-it note

00:13:35.183 --> 00:13:38.481
also gets put on synapses in the brain

00:13:38.505 --> 00:13:40.369
and prompts their elimination.

00:13:41.154 --> 00:13:44.420
Now, the creation and elimination
of synapses is a normal part

00:13:44.444 --> 00:13:46.298
of human development and learning.

00:13:46.322 --> 00:13:49.243
Our brains create and eliminate
synapses all the time.

00:13:49.921 --> 00:13:52.881
But our genetic results suggest
that in schizophrenia,

00:13:52.905 --> 00:13:56.138
the elimination process
may go into overdrive.

00:13:57.185 --> 00:14:01.114
Scientists at many drug companies tell me
they're excited about this discovery,

00:14:01.138 --> 00:14:04.377
because they've been working
on complement proteins for years

00:14:04.401 --> 00:14:05.941
in the immune system,

00:14:05.965 --> 00:14:08.171
and they've learned a lot
about how they work.

00:14:08.885 --> 00:14:12.779
They've even developed molecules
that interfere with complement proteins,

00:14:12.803 --> 00:14:16.410
and they're starting to test them
in the brain as well as the immune system.

00:14:17.124 --> 00:14:21.845
It's potentially a path toward a drug
that might address a root cause

00:14:21.869 --> 00:14:24.518
rather than an individual symptom,

00:14:24.542 --> 00:14:28.590
and we hope very much that this work
by many scientists over many years

00:14:28.614 --> 00:14:29.766
will be successful.

00:14:31.689 --> 00:14:34.703
But C4 is just one example

00:14:34.727 --> 00:14:37.839
of the potential for data-driven
scientific approaches

00:14:37.863 --> 00:14:41.766
to open new fronts on medical problems
that are centuries old.

00:14:42.144 --> 00:14:44.889
There are hundreds of places
in our genomes

00:14:44.913 --> 00:14:47.498
that shape risk for brain illnesses,

00:14:47.522 --> 00:14:51.588
and any one of them could lead us
to the next molecular insight

00:14:51.612 --> 00:14:53.632
about a molecule that matters.

00:14:53.656 --> 00:14:57.643
And there are hundreds of cell types that
use these genes in different combinations.

00:14:57.667 --> 00:14:59.736
As we and other scientists
work to generate

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.829
the rest of the data that's needed

00:15:01.853 --> 00:15:04.246
and to learn all that we can
from that data,

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.673
we hope to open many more new fronts.

00:15:08.483 --> 00:15:13.562
Genetics and single-cell analysis
are just two ways

00:15:13.586 --> 00:15:17.353
of trying to turn the brain
into a big data problem.

00:15:18.424 --> 00:15:20.583
There is so much more we can do.

00:15:21.235 --> 00:15:24.309
Scientists in my lab
are creating a technology

00:15:24.333 --> 00:15:27.529
for quickly mapping the synaptic
connections in the brain

00:15:27.553 --> 00:15:30.491
to tell which neurons are talking
to which other neurons

00:15:30.515 --> 00:15:34.511
and how that conversation changes
throughout life and during illness.

00:15:35.467 --> 00:15:39.987
And we're developing a way
to test in a single tube

00:15:40.011 --> 00:15:42.729
how cells with hundreds
of different people's genomes

00:15:42.753 --> 00:15:44.923
respond differently to the same stimulus.

00:15:46.248 --> 00:15:51.151
These projects bring together
people with diverse backgrounds

00:15:51.175 --> 00:15:53.668
and training and interests --

00:15:53.692 --> 00:15:59.569
biology, computers, chemistry,
math, statistics, engineering.

00:16:00.205 --> 00:16:04.437
But the scientific possibilities
rally people with diverse interests

00:16:04.461 --> 00:16:06.696
into working intensely together.

00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:11.422
What's the future
that we could hope to create?

00:16:12.267 --> 00:16:13.617
Consider cancer.

00:16:14.193 --> 00:16:18.115
We've moved from an era of ignorance
about what causes cancer,

00:16:18.139 --> 00:16:25.127
in which cancer was commonly ascribed
to personal psychological characteristics,

00:16:26.238 --> 00:16:31.633
to a modern molecular understanding
of the true biological causes of cancer.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.174
That understanding today
leads to innovative medicine

00:16:35.198 --> 00:16:36.894
after innovative medicine,

00:16:36.918 --> 00:16:39.757
and although there's still
so much work to do,

00:16:39.781 --> 00:16:43.175
we're already surrounded by people
who have been cured of cancers

00:16:43.199 --> 00:16:46.468
that were considered untreatable
a generation ago.

00:16:48.254 --> 00:16:51.630
And millions of cancer survivors
like my sister

00:16:51.654 --> 00:16:56.055
find themselves with years of life
that they didn't take for granted

00:16:56.079 --> 00:16:57.848
and new opportunities

00:16:57.872 --> 00:17:01.802
for work and joy and human connection.

00:17:03.358 --> 00:17:07.736
That is the future that we are determined
to create around mental illness --

00:17:08.581 --> 00:17:12.700
one of real understanding and empathy

00:17:12.724 --> 00:17:14.540
and limitless possibility.

00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:16.349
Thank you.

00:17:16.374 --> 00:17:20.436
(Applause)
