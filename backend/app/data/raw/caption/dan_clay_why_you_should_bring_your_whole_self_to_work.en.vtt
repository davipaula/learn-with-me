00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.776
A leader is steady, firm,
decisive, unwavering.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.256
Never let 'em see you sweat,
always have an answer.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.040
[The Way We Work]

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.500
My name is Dan, I'm a partner
at a global creative consultancy.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.296
But there's another side to me:

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.616
Carrie Dragshaw,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.536
the character I created on Instagram.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.176
As I thought about my double life,
I couldn't help but wonder ...

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.536
When your true self
is a little nontraditional,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.240
how much of it can you really
bring to the office?

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.496
For some of us is authenticity off-limits?

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.176
For the first 10 years of my career,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.616
I thought there was
one way to be a leader:

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.816
decisive and serious.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.496
But that's not me.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.256
So I'd put on basically
office drag to fit the role:

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.336
I'd talk in a deeper voice,
try to hold in my hand motions.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.856
I'm someone who gets
really excited about things,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.416
so I'd temper that.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.296
I had this little voice
in my head, telling me,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.856
"You're too gay,
too feminine, too flamboyant."

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.656
I had one well-intentioned
adviser who said,

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.856
"Everyone knows you're gay.
And that's great.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.776
But you don't need to beat them
over the head with it."

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.896
Cut to: me in a tutu, for Halloween 2016.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.336
I dressed up as my favorite
TV show character, Carrie Bradshaw,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.576
thinking my friends
would get a kick out of it.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.616
And then, things got crazy.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.496
The post went viral,
and at first it was pure fun.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.616
I started getting these incredible
messages from people

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.056
about how happy it made them,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.016
how it encouraged them
to be their authentic selves.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.296
And I started to think,

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.896
maybe this is the time to tell that
little voice in my head to just shut up

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.680
and let myself be me.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.616
But then things got a little too big.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.336
Carrie Dragshaw was everywhere --
In the "New York Post", "US Weekly" --

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.656
and I got terrified:

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.216
"What would my bosses think?

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.496
Would my coworkers
still respect me as a leader?

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.096
What would my clients think?"

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.976
I thought I was going to have to
get a different job.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.776
But then, something happened,
something small.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.896
I got a text from my boss,
it wasn't long, it just said,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.456
"Wow, Cosmo!"

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.015
With a link to an article
that had just gone up about me.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.936
And it let me put that little,
scared voice away

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.456
and just be excited
about this whole new world,

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.176
rather than freaked out.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.776
That's the power of one person,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.136
sometimes all it takes is one ally
to make you feel comfortable.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.256
And my coworkers
started acting differently.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.776
They became more open,
more playful with me,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.016
it was as if knowing this other side of me

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.776
gave them permission
to be more of themselves as well.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.576
I thought that openness and vulnerability

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.336
would actually decrease
my standing with my team.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.136
But it's done the opposite.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.896
Two years in,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.296
I never could have imagined that this
part of me would not just be embraced,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.376
but could actually help my career.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.976
Now, I'm lucky.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.416
I work in New York City,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.856
in an office where creativity is valued

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.896
and I was already pretty established
in my career when all of this started.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.576
Maybe that's you, maybe it isn't.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.656
But all of this has taught me so much

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.976
about just the importance
of bringing your whole self to work.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.576
And it's really challenged
my own misperceptions

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.536
about what it takes to be successful.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.296
There's no one kind of way to be a leader.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.296
It's about finding your strengths
and finding ways to amplify them.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.536
Before, if a meeting was hard,
I'd put on my perfect leader mask.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.296
Now, I can say,
"Gosh, that was frustrating."

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.856
We can talk about challenges
and struggles in an open way,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.616
rather than everybody pretending
that they're fine until it's too late.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.096
Concealing an identity takes work.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.896
Think of all the wasted energy
spent pretending,

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.696
wishing you were someone different.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.256
What's most interesting to me, though,
is that in this big study of covering,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.816
93 percent of those
who say they're doing it

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.880
also believe their organization
values inclusion.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.176
So clearly, our workplaces
and all of our strange inner voices

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.336
have a long way to go on acceptance.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.136
There's a big difference
between adapting and disguising.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.496
And I think I learned that a little late.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.136
Personally, I'm taking all of this
as a call to be the ally

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.696
who, like my boss did for me,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.310
lets people know that it's OK to open up.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:15.151
If you're gay, or proud
of your ethnic background,

00:04:15.176 --> 00:04:17.752
or have a disability
or are deeply religious,

00:04:17.777 --> 00:04:21.313
see what it's like
being your full self at work.

00:04:21.338 --> 00:04:23.218
You might be pleasantly surprised.
