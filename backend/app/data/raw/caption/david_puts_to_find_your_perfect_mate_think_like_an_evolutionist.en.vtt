00:00:14.253 --> 00:00:15.336
Hi there.

00:00:15.336 --> 00:00:19.056
I could be wrong, but I think
this talk may have the distinction

00:00:19.056 --> 00:00:23.476
of being the one talk in this series
that ends with orgasm.

00:00:23.476 --> 00:00:25.806
(Laughter)

00:00:25.816 --> 00:00:30.296
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
(Laughter)

00:00:31.693 --> 00:00:33.626
Have you ever thought about the fact

00:00:33.626 --> 00:00:35.656
that you're here, alive on this planet

00:00:35.656 --> 00:00:37.846
because every one
of your ancestors reproduced?

00:00:37.846 --> 00:00:39.786
Every one, in an unbroken chain,

00:00:39.786 --> 00:00:42.366
all the way back
to the first life on this planet,

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:44.916
over three and a half billion years ago.

00:00:44.916 --> 00:00:46.916
That's a lot of reproducing.

00:00:46.926 --> 00:00:49.196
And for the past billion years,

00:00:49.196 --> 00:00:51.472
your ancestors reproduced sexually.

00:00:51.472 --> 00:00:53.626
So sex is a pretty big deal.

00:00:53.626 --> 00:00:55.721
But you probably knew that.

00:00:56.616 --> 00:00:58.966
But let's talk about human mating.

00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:01.766
Why does human mating
take the forms that it does?

00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:04.182
Why are we attracted to certain people?

00:01:04.182 --> 00:01:07.097
Why do we sometimes
form long-term romantic relationships?

00:01:07.097 --> 00:01:08.846
Why do we sometimes cheat?

00:01:08.846 --> 00:01:12.436
Now I don't mean
why consciously do we do these things.

00:01:12.436 --> 00:01:15.166
I don't mean
what happens in the brain to cause it.

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:18.566
I mean, why did we evolve these feelings
and these behaviors?

00:01:18.566 --> 00:01:21.206
In other words,
how did the underlying brain structures

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:24.536
and brain chemistry contribute
to our ancestors' reproductive success

00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:27.596
so that those traits got passed on
into the present generation

00:01:27.596 --> 00:01:28.616
while others didn't.

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:32.776
Answering evolutionary questions like this
is like being a crime scene investigator,

00:01:32.776 --> 00:01:34.556
we're left with the evidence,

00:01:34.556 --> 00:01:37.706
and we have to try to establish
what happened.

00:01:37.727 --> 00:01:40.626
So let's go back
six or seven million years ago

00:01:40.626 --> 00:01:42.956
to our early ancestors.

00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:45.516
This is right after
the split between our lineage

00:01:45.516 --> 00:01:48.596
and the lineage that would eventually
give rise to chimpanzees.

00:01:48.596 --> 00:01:51.636
Now these were small brained apes,
they walked on two legs,

00:01:51.636 --> 00:01:54.656
and males probably fought each other
for mating opportunities.

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:57.046
We know this because males
fight for mates in all

00:01:57.046 --> 00:02:00.476
of our closest living relatives,
chimpanzees, orangutans, gorillas.

00:02:00.476 --> 00:02:04.186
And because males are larger than females
when they fight for mates.

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:06.856
And the fossil record indicates

00:02:06.856 --> 00:02:10.386
that our male ancestors
were larger than females.

00:02:11.395 --> 00:02:14.676
So males tend to be larger,
more muscular, stronger,

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:17.546
more physically aggressive,
when they fight for mates.

00:02:17.546 --> 00:02:19.196
Our species has all the hallmarks

00:02:19.196 --> 00:02:22.156
of a species that's experienced
an evolutionary history

00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:24.356
of male fighting for mates.

00:02:24.366 --> 00:02:28.666
For example, men have, on average,
60 percent more muscle mass,

00:02:28.666 --> 00:02:31.406
and 75 percent more
upper body muscle mass,

00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:33.426
and those differences in musculature

00:02:33.426 --> 00:02:35.936
translate into large sex differences
in strength.

00:02:35.936 --> 00:02:38.296
The average man is stronger
than 99.9% of women.

00:02:38.296 --> 00:02:41.346
These are data on hand strength,
which is a good predictor

00:02:41.346 --> 00:02:44.596
of overall upper body strength,
on over 600 men and women.

00:02:44.616 --> 00:02:47.186
And as you can see,
there's a large sex difference.

00:02:47.186 --> 00:02:50.726
And in fact, not one
of almost 400 women had as strong

00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:53.656
of a hand strength as the average man.

00:02:53.656 --> 00:02:56.778
So, men can open jars.

00:02:56.805 --> 00:02:58.298
(Laughter)

00:02:58.298 --> 00:03:01.836
And move furniture or at least two things
that we're good for.

00:03:01.845 --> 00:03:03.106
Who cares, right?

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:06.286
The answer is that men care.

00:03:07.701 --> 00:03:10.086
Men, especially young men,
seem really concerned

00:03:10.086 --> 00:03:12.616
about figuring out
who's the toughest or strongest,

00:03:12.616 --> 00:03:14.386
or the most physically formidable,

00:03:14.386 --> 00:03:17.616
and sometimes they devise elaborate ways
for determining this.

00:03:17.616 --> 00:03:19.046
From early development,

00:03:19.046 --> 00:03:22.106
boys and men are more
physically aggressive than girls and women

00:03:22.106 --> 00:03:23.456
all over the world,

00:03:23.456 --> 00:03:25.856
and this aggression
sometimes results in violence.

00:03:25.856 --> 00:03:28.736
Men have a virtual monopoly
on same-sex homicides.

00:03:28.736 --> 00:03:30.756
In other words, men are vastly more likely

00:03:30.756 --> 00:03:33.596
to kill each other
than women are to kill each other.

00:03:33.596 --> 00:03:36.966
These are data from every society
from every time period in history

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:40.136
for which data were available
when the authors compiled them,

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:43.726
on proportion of same-sex homicides
that are male killing male.

00:03:43.736 --> 00:03:47.396
And as you can see,
the percentage is always close to 100%.

00:03:47.396 --> 00:03:51.036
On average, 95%
of same-sex homicides are committed

00:03:51.036 --> 00:03:54.036
by males, and importantly,
these don't include war killings,

00:03:54.036 --> 00:03:57.396
which would bring the percentages
even closer to 100%.

00:03:58.577 --> 00:04:00.976
And from what evidence that we have,

00:04:00.976 --> 00:04:06.166
a dominance among men translates into
mating and reproductive opportunities.

00:04:06.176 --> 00:04:09.916
So we're a species that's experienced
an evolutionary history

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:12.826
in which our male ancestors
won mating opportunities

00:04:12.826 --> 00:04:15.166
through the use or threat of force.

00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:17.845
In that regard, our apple
has not fallen far

00:04:17.845 --> 00:04:19.366
from the evolutionary tree.

00:04:20.101 --> 00:04:22.706
But in other ways, human mating
and reproduction

00:04:22.706 --> 00:04:25.976
are profoundly different
from what we see in our close relatives,

00:04:25.986 --> 00:04:30.222
and they've changed a lot
since our early ancestors.

00:04:31.036 --> 00:04:35.356
For example, males in chimpanzees,
orangutans and gorillas,

00:04:36.006 --> 00:04:38.376
spend time and effort competing for mates,

00:04:38.376 --> 00:04:41.126
but don't spend much time
with individual females

00:04:41.126 --> 00:04:43.476
and don't provide resources.

00:04:43.491 --> 00:04:45.696
They don't provide food
for their offspring.

00:04:45.696 --> 00:04:47.006
So that's a big change.

00:04:47.006 --> 00:04:50.626
Although most human societies
allow polygamous marriage,

00:04:50.626 --> 00:04:53.446
that is one man married
to more than one woman,

00:04:53.446 --> 00:04:57.396
even within polygamous societies,
most marriages are monogamous.

00:04:57.396 --> 00:05:00.776
And in the average
hunter-gatherer society,

00:05:00.776 --> 00:05:03.436
almost 80% of married women
are monogamous,

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:05.396
so that's different.

00:05:05.396 --> 00:05:09.826
And, importantly, men provide resources
for their mates and offspring.

00:05:09.826 --> 00:05:11.266
So how did we get there?

00:05:11.266 --> 00:05:14.946
Well, in species where males
fight each other for mates,

00:05:14.946 --> 00:05:20.116
dominant males indicated by the larger,
darker male symbols here,

00:05:20.156 --> 00:05:23.236
tend to have more mating opportunities,
and hence more offspring.

00:05:23.236 --> 00:05:26.356
And subordinate males
tend to have fewer mating opportunities

00:05:26.356 --> 00:05:29.616
and are more likely to fail to reproduce.

00:05:29.646 --> 00:05:33.986
So this sets up an interesting situation,
because for subordinate males,

00:05:33.986 --> 00:05:37.296
it would be advantageous
to attempt monogamy

00:05:37.296 --> 00:05:39.616
rather than winning
lots of mating opportunities.

00:05:39.616 --> 00:05:41.586
One mate is better than none.

00:05:41.596 --> 00:05:43.786
The problem is that in general,

00:05:43.796 --> 00:05:46.656
subordinate males cannot defend females
from dominant males,

00:05:46.656 --> 00:05:50.426
and besides, females tend to prefer mating
with dominant males

00:05:50.428 --> 00:05:54.376
for the genetic benefits,
producing stronger, healthier offspring.

00:05:54.376 --> 00:05:58.706
So what changed all of this
was probably several transitions

00:05:58.706 --> 00:06:01.406
happening together around the same time.

00:06:01.406 --> 00:06:03.526
By about two and a half million years ago,

00:06:03.526 --> 00:06:06.686
we had started to incorporate
more meat into our diet.

00:06:06.686 --> 00:06:09.236
We know this from various
lines of evidence,

00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:12.626
including - this is cool - stone tool
cut marks on animal bones

00:06:12.626 --> 00:06:14.596
dated to 2.5 million years ago.

00:06:14.596 --> 00:06:18.240
That's cool. I love this stuff!

00:06:18.536 --> 00:06:22.836
And then by about 2 million years ago,
brain size really started to increase,

00:06:22.836 --> 00:06:25.536
and with that came a lengthening
of the juvenile period,

00:06:25.536 --> 00:06:28.536
so now kids became both
really costly and costly

00:06:28.536 --> 00:06:30.661
for a long period of time.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.496
And this made male provisioning
both possible and necessary.

00:06:37.496 --> 00:06:41.986
Possible because it's much easier
to bring back calories,

00:06:41.986 --> 00:06:44.736
protein, fats, in the form of meat
than trying to do that

00:06:44.736 --> 00:06:46.476
by transporting plant foods,

00:06:46.476 --> 00:06:49.986
and necessary because kids became
so energetically costly

00:06:49.986 --> 00:06:52.866
that individual females
would have had trouble providing

00:06:52.866 --> 00:06:55.096
resources for themselves
and their offspring.

00:06:55.106 --> 00:06:57.886
And when we look
at modern hunter-gatherer societies,

00:06:57.886 --> 00:06:59.526
that's what we see.

00:06:59.526 --> 00:07:03.076
These are aggregate data
across several hunter-gatherer societies

00:07:03.076 --> 00:07:04.806
on net daily calories.

00:07:04.806 --> 00:07:07.706
Are you bringing in more calories
than you consume,

00:07:09.176 --> 00:07:11.756
or are you consuming
more than you bring in?

00:07:11.756 --> 00:07:17.706
And the green bars
are net daily caloric surplus,

00:07:17.706 --> 00:07:20.146
in other words, bringing in
more than you consume.

00:07:20.146 --> 00:07:22.386
And the red bars are a deficit,

00:07:22.386 --> 00:07:24.446
so you're consuming more
than you bring in.

00:07:24.446 --> 00:07:27.026
And you'll notice that men
from about 20 years of age

00:07:27.026 --> 00:07:30.746
to 60 years of age are operating
at a daily caloric surplus.

00:07:30.746 --> 00:07:33.116
They bring in,
generally through hunting,

00:07:33.116 --> 00:07:36.600
more calories than they can consume,
and these calories are distributed.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.846
If it's large game,
it's generally distributed

00:07:38.846 --> 00:07:41.076
equally to everybody
in the village or camp.

00:07:41.076 --> 00:07:43.706
Smaller items can be brought back

00:07:43.716 --> 00:07:46.796
to individual family,
but this contrasts with what's going on

00:07:46.796 --> 00:07:50.126
with women, in their reproductive years,

00:07:50.136 --> 00:07:53.346
they're operating
at a daily caloric deficit.

00:07:53.346 --> 00:07:56.636
Gestation, lactation, carrying babies,

00:07:56.636 --> 00:07:59.686
are extremely costly energetically

00:07:59.686 --> 00:08:02.586
and limit one's ability
to forage efficiently.

00:08:02.586 --> 00:08:05.306
So male provisioning,
both possible through hunting,

00:08:05.306 --> 00:08:07.066
and necessary.

00:08:07.066 --> 00:08:10.536
And this change had profound impacts

00:08:10.536 --> 00:08:12.686
on human mating and reproduction.

00:08:12.686 --> 00:08:15.346
In a sense,
it tipped the balance for females.

00:08:15.346 --> 00:08:18.416
So now it was sometimes worth mating
with a subordinate male,

00:08:18.416 --> 00:08:21.156
even if he may not possess the best genes,

00:08:21.156 --> 00:08:23.066
if he provided resources.

00:08:23.812 --> 00:08:29.086
And this is baboon pornography.
(Laughter)

00:08:29.086 --> 00:08:32.226
I probably should have warned you
there'd be monkey porn.

00:08:32.226 --> 00:08:35.076
This is from PlayBaboon Magazine.

00:08:35.835 --> 00:08:37.916
Alright, I'm going to stop with the jokes.

00:08:37.916 --> 00:08:40.975
This is a female baboon in estrus,
so her genitals are swollen,

00:08:40.976 --> 00:08:43.146
and this happens
in a lot of primate species.

00:08:43.146 --> 00:08:46.216
Females' appearance
changes over the cycle,

00:08:46.216 --> 00:08:47.836
and becomes more attractive

00:08:47.836 --> 00:08:50.576
and this incites male competition
for females

00:08:50.576 --> 00:08:52.666
during the fertile part of the cycle,

00:08:52.666 --> 00:08:55.336
with dominant males tending
to monopolize copulations,

00:08:55.336 --> 00:08:56.976
closer to ovulation.

00:08:56.976 --> 00:08:59.016
Well. We don't look like this.

00:08:59.016 --> 00:09:00.066
And you knew that.

00:09:00.066 --> 00:09:01.626
But what you might not know

00:09:01.626 --> 00:09:04.596
is that women's attractiveness
does change over the cycle.

00:09:04.596 --> 00:09:08.576
My lab, and others, have shown
that women's faces, voices, even odors,

00:09:08.576 --> 00:09:11.656
are more attractive to men
during the fertile part of the cycle.

00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:14.206
But these changes are extremely subtle.

00:09:14.216 --> 00:09:16.218
And compared to other primates, 

00:09:16.218 --> 00:09:20.606
the evidence indicates that we've evolved
to suppress cues to ovulation.

00:09:20.606 --> 00:09:23.906
That in a sense,
ovulation is concealed in humans.

00:09:23.906 --> 00:09:27.146
But think about what impact
this would have.

00:09:27.146 --> 00:09:30.346
This would mean that dominant males 

00:09:30.346 --> 00:09:33.626
would not be able to monopolize
copulations near ovulation.

00:09:33.626 --> 00:09:38.516
It would protect the pair bond
from invasion by a dominant male.

00:09:38.516 --> 00:09:42.526
So that a male in a pair
would have more confidence

00:09:42.526 --> 00:09:44.996
that he was the father of the offspring.

00:09:44.996 --> 00:09:47.616
The couple is having sex
throughout the cycle.

00:09:47.616 --> 00:09:49.476
And this is unique to human mating,

00:09:49.476 --> 00:09:51.756
we don't see it in many other primates.

00:09:51.756 --> 00:09:54.376
We have sex throughout the cycle.

00:09:54.376 --> 00:09:57.466
And so this would essentially
increase a male's confidence

00:09:57.466 --> 00:10:00.316
in paternity, because a dominant
or some other male

00:10:00.316 --> 00:10:02.396
wouldn't be able to target the female

00:10:02.396 --> 00:10:05.176
and bully their way in
at the fertile point in the cycle.

00:10:05.176 --> 00:10:09.176
And this would have important implications
for parental investment,

00:10:09.176 --> 00:10:13.266
in particular, males providing resources
for their offspring.

00:10:13.266 --> 00:10:14.936
Because across species,

00:10:14.936 --> 00:10:17.276
when males provide resources
for offspring,

00:10:17.276 --> 00:10:21.026
they target those resources
toward their own biological offspring,

00:10:21.026 --> 00:10:24.596
and they avoid investing
in the offspring of unrelated males.

00:10:24.596 --> 00:10:28.996
And so the evolution
of male care for offspring

00:10:28.996 --> 00:10:33.776
and investing in resources and offspring,
pair bonding, and concealed ovulation,

00:10:33.776 --> 00:10:37.936
went very much hand-in-hand
over our evolution.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.186
We have also evolved
a specialized psychology

00:10:41.186 --> 00:10:43.616
for forming long-term
romantic relationships

00:10:43.616 --> 00:10:46.466
with the possibility of investing
in offspring together.

00:10:46.466 --> 00:10:48.056
We fall in love.

00:10:48.056 --> 00:10:50.756
All around the world,
people prefer mates who are kind

00:10:50.756 --> 00:10:53.476
and generous and capable
and willing to care

00:10:53.476 --> 00:10:54.626
for mates and offspring.

00:10:54.626 --> 00:10:57.026
In one of the largest
cross-cultural studies

00:10:57.026 --> 00:10:59.416
of human mate preferences ever conducted,

00:10:59.416 --> 00:11:02.006
covering 33 countries shown in red here,

00:11:02.006 --> 00:11:05.726
the single most important mate choice
criterion to both men and women,

00:11:05.726 --> 00:11:08.416
was mutual love and attraction.

00:11:08.767 --> 00:11:10.166
But as you also know,

00:11:10.166 --> 00:11:12.846
people are not always
perfectly faithful to their mates.

00:11:12.846 --> 00:11:15.356
And in particular,
women sometimes face a tradeoff

00:11:15.356 --> 00:11:17.546
between good genes and investment.

00:11:17.556 --> 00:11:19.426
Women sometimes find themselves

00:11:19.426 --> 00:11:22.566
in relationships with men
who may be caring providers,

00:11:22.566 --> 00:11:25.396
but may not possess
the best quality genes for offspring

00:11:25.396 --> 00:11:27.726
making them strong and healthy.

00:11:27.726 --> 00:11:30.726
And several features
of women's mating psychology

00:11:30.726 --> 00:11:33.426
seem to have evolved, in part,
to resolve this trade off.

00:11:33.426 --> 00:11:36.766
And I mean, recruiting genes,
if you will,

00:11:36.766 --> 00:11:38.986
from outside of the long-term
relationship.

00:11:38.996 --> 00:11:42.856
For example,
women have more sexual fantasies

00:11:42.856 --> 00:11:45.036
about men other
than their long-term partner,

00:11:45.036 --> 00:11:46.866
during the fertile part of the cycle,

00:11:46.866 --> 00:11:48.886
and that's particularly true

00:11:48.886 --> 00:11:51.386
if the long-term partner
has physical signs

00:11:51.386 --> 00:11:54.766
of being lower in genetic quality,
like he's less physically attractive.

00:11:56.178 --> 00:11:58.096
I think that's interesting.
(Laughter)

00:11:58.096 --> 00:12:00.936
That's why I'm talking about it,
I hope you do too.

00:12:00.936 --> 00:12:05.166
And women's mate preferences
similarly change over the cycle

00:12:05.166 --> 00:12:06.816
so that they prefer more dominant,

00:12:06.816 --> 00:12:09.696
more masculine males
during the fertile part of the cycle.

00:12:09.696 --> 00:12:13.136
These are results of a study 
that I conducted

00:12:13.136 --> 00:12:16.076
on women's preferences for men's voices.

00:12:16.076 --> 00:12:20.426
And I used computer software
to manipulate recordings of men's voices

00:12:20.426 --> 00:12:22.626
to make them sound
either more masculine

00:12:22.626 --> 00:12:25.246
or more dominant,
or more subordinate, more feminine.

00:12:25.246 --> 00:12:26.616
And I had women rate them

00:12:26.626 --> 00:12:28.936
on how attractive would this man be 

00:12:28.936 --> 00:12:31.336
for a short-term,
purely sexual relationship,

00:12:31.336 --> 00:12:33.566
and for a long-term
committed relationship?

00:12:33.566 --> 00:12:36.846
And I also got information
about where women were in their cycles.

00:12:36.846 --> 00:12:40.146
Were they in the fertile
or non-fertile part of the cycle?

00:12:40.146 --> 00:12:42.816
These were all women
not taking hormonal contraception.

00:12:42.816 --> 00:12:45.746
And what I found was that
women preferred a more masculine,

00:12:45.746 --> 00:12:50.306
dominant-sounding voice, specifically
in the fertile point of the cycle,

00:12:50.346 --> 00:12:54.556
and only for a sexual relationship
versus a long-term committed relationship.

00:12:54.556 --> 00:12:57.796
Now, this sounds like science fiction,

00:12:57.796 --> 00:13:00.266
but it's science, fact.

00:13:00.266 --> 00:13:03.956
Because this result has been shown
lots of times

00:13:03.956 --> 00:13:07.416
across a variety of domains from
women's preferences for men's voices,

00:13:07.416 --> 00:13:10.376
that this result was replicated
by another lab.

00:13:10.376 --> 00:13:13.216
Women's preferences
for men's faces, bodies,

00:13:13.216 --> 00:13:15.282
odors, and even behavior.

00:13:17.366 --> 00:13:22.616
Well, I said that we would get to orgasm.
(Laughter)

00:13:22.616 --> 00:13:24.156
And we're there.

00:13:24.156 --> 00:13:28.546
I just want to start by saying I'm for it.
(Laughter)

00:13:28.546 --> 00:13:29.906
I'm pro-orgasm.

00:13:29.906 --> 00:13:32.611
I think more people
should have more orgasms.

00:13:32.676 --> 00:13:35.296
But from a scientific perspective,

00:13:35.296 --> 00:13:37.836
women's orgasm is especially fascinating

00:13:37.836 --> 00:13:42.086
because there's evidence indicating
that it increases the probability

00:13:42.086 --> 00:13:44.756
that conception will result
from an act of sex.

00:13:44.756 --> 00:13:47.246
There's evidence that it brings sperm

00:13:47.246 --> 00:13:50.296
up through the female reproductive tract
and toward the egg.

00:13:50.296 --> 00:13:52.836
And think about what
the implications here could be.

00:13:52.836 --> 00:13:56.196
If women were more likely
to have orgasms with some men than others,

00:13:56.196 --> 00:13:58.076
then this could be a mechanism

00:13:58.076 --> 00:14:00.446
by which they choose, not consciously,

00:14:00.446 --> 00:14:02.986
to be fertilized
by some males and not others.

00:14:02.996 --> 00:14:06.076
And wouldn't you predict
that women would be more likely

00:14:06.076 --> 00:14:09.806
to have orgasms with males
of high genetic quality?

00:14:09.806 --> 00:14:13.686
And in fact, a study by my lab published
just a couple of years ago

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:16.666
found that women reported more orgasms,

00:14:16.666 --> 00:14:19.756
earlier timed orgasms, that is,
they were easier to achieve,

00:14:19.756 --> 00:14:22.736
they achieved them more quickly,
when they were having sex

00:14:22.736 --> 00:14:25.526
when their mate was more masculine
and more dominant,

00:14:25.536 --> 00:14:28.066
and what's interesting
is that this was true only

00:14:28.066 --> 00:14:30.996
for their orgasms from sexual intercourse,

00:14:31.006 --> 00:14:33.886
but not from other
partnered sexual behaviors.

00:14:33.886 --> 00:14:38.556
I'll let you use your imagination
what those might be.

00:14:38.556 --> 00:14:42.096
So we've seen that thinking
like an evolutionist

00:14:42.096 --> 00:14:44.476
can enable us to predict things
about ourselves

00:14:44.476 --> 00:14:46.106
that we did not already know,

00:14:46.106 --> 00:14:48.516
and would not likely have guessed
for a long time.

00:14:48.526 --> 00:14:51.346
We didn't know
that women's mate preferences changed

00:14:51.346 --> 00:14:52.556
over the cycle.

00:14:52.556 --> 00:14:55.326
Until evolutionary thinking
led us to that discovery.

00:14:55.326 --> 00:14:57.446
So that's one point that I want to make.

00:14:57.446 --> 00:15:00.736
But we've also seen
how evolutionary thinking can clarify

00:15:00.736 --> 00:15:03.046
and unite diverse parts
of the human experience,

00:15:03.046 --> 00:15:05.886
and help us understand
the best and the worst of ourselves,

00:15:05.896 --> 00:15:09.946
from violence and aggression
and infidelity

00:15:09.946 --> 00:15:13.176
to men's care for their children,

00:15:13.176 --> 00:15:16.076
sexual attraction, sexual pleasure,

00:15:16.076 --> 00:15:19.556
and even the strength
and fragility of romantic love.

00:15:19.556 --> 00:15:20.628
Thank you.

00:15:20.628 --> 00:15:23.375
(Applause)
