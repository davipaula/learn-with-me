00:00:12.963 --> 00:00:14.373
Hello, everyone.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.405
Growing up in my family
gives you a certain sense of history.

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:22.545
I'm simply the latest in a line
that can be traced back generations.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.176
This oak tree is close to Windsor Castle,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.638
which has been home to my family
for over 900 years.

00:00:30.116 --> 00:00:35.314
Thirty-nine monarchs have lived here
and enjoyed these beautiful surroundings.

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:38.526
I've walked here many times myself,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.246
and it always amazes me
that some of the trees planted here,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.846
living organisms, dependent
on soil, rain and sunlight,

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.163
were here as they laid
the first stones of Windsor Castle.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.938
That makes some of the oaks here
almost 1,000 years old.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.186
These trees germinated during the reign
of William the Conqueror in 1066,

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.863
from a simple acorn like this.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.526
By the time that Henry VIII lived here,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.783
they'd grown into mature,
impressive giants.

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:12.913
And amazingly,

00:01:12.937 --> 00:01:16.648
some of those very same trees
still survive here today.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.896
They're a bit gnarled and hollowed-out,

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.072
but they're still very much alive.

00:01:23.523 --> 00:01:25.426
While these oaks have been growing,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.801
around 35 billion people
have lived their lives on our planet.

00:01:30.825 --> 00:01:37.360
That's 35 billion lifetimes' worth
of hope, love, fear and dreams.

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:42.112
In that time, humankind
has invented air travel,

00:01:42.136 --> 00:01:44.346
vaccines and computers.

00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:47.576
We've explored every part of the globe,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.514
sequenced the human genome

00:01:49.538 --> 00:01:52.471
and even escaped Earth's atmosphere.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.326
Our speed of innovation
has been incredible,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.183
but so, too, has
the acceleration of our impact.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.236
Over my grandmother's lifetime,
the last 90 years or so,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.030
our impacts accelerated so fast

00:02:08.054 --> 00:02:13.419
that our climate, oceans, air,
nature and all that depends on them

00:02:13.443 --> 00:02:14.712
are in peril.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.632
This oak has stood here for centuries,

00:02:18.656 --> 00:02:21.799
but never has it faced a decade like this.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.607
We start this new decade

00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:28.434
knowing that it is the most
consequential period in history.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.051
The science is irrefutable.

00:02:31.756 --> 00:02:34.116
If we do not act in this decade,

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.189
the damage that we have done
will be irreversible.

00:02:37.538 --> 00:02:40.656
And the effects felt
not just by future generations

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.387
but by all of us alive today.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.400
And what's more, this damage
will not be felt equally by everyone.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.136
It is the most vulnerable,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.106
those with the fewest resources

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.326
and those who've done the least
to cause climate change

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.375
who will be impacted the most.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.656
These stark facts are terrifying.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.245
How can we hope to fix
such massive intractable problems?

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.499
It may seem overwhelming,
but it is possible.

00:03:10.605 --> 00:03:15.670
Humans have an extraordinary capacity
to set goals and strive to achieve them.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.027
I've long been inspired
by President John F. Kennedy's

00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:23.476
1961 mission to put a man
on the moon within a decade.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.826
He named it the Moonshot.

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.206
It seemed crazy.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.656
We'd only just launched
the first satellite.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.413
Putting a man on the moon
that quickly seemed impossible.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.086
But this simple challenge
encompassed so much.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.326
He called it a goal
to organize and measure

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.593
the best of our energies and skills.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.696
In taking that giant leap for mankind,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.316
the team behind the Moonshot

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.331
united millions of people
around the world --

00:03:51.355 --> 00:03:55.368
that this crazy ambition
wasn't so crazy after all.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.643
And along the way, it helped the invention
of breathing equipment,

00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:02.608
CAT scanners and solar panels.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.156
But now, rather than a Moonshot
for this decade,

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.343
we need Earthshots.

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:14.688
We must harness that same
spirit of human ingenuity and purpose

00:04:14.712 --> 00:04:17.925
and turn it with laser sharp
focus and urgency

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.126
on the most pressing challenge
we have ever faced,

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.253
repairing our planet.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.948
The shared goals
for our generation are clear.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.609
Together, we must protect
and restore nature,

00:04:31.633 --> 00:04:35.688
clean our air, revive our oceans,

00:04:35.712 --> 00:04:39.804
build a waste-free world
and fix our climate.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.185
And we must strive
to do all of this in a decade.

00:04:45.296 --> 00:04:47.056
If we achieve these goals,

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.936
by 2030 our lives won't be worse,

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.586
and we won't have to
sacrifice everything we enjoy.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.316
Instead, the way we live
will be healthier,

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.283
cleaner, smarter and better for all of us.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.171
The global response
to the COVID-19 pandemic

00:05:04.195 --> 00:05:07.746
and the funds flowing
into the economic recovery

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.136
demonstrate how much can be achieved

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.246
when those in positions
of power come together

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.802
and decide to act.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.836
We built hospitals overnight,
repurposed factories,

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.350
poured billions into the search
for a vaccine and better treatments.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.716
And we've been inspired by heroes emerging
in every community across the world.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.518
Young people no longer believe
that change is too difficult.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.590
They witnessed the world turn on its head.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.646
They believe that the climate crisis
and the threat to our biodiversity

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.873
deserves our full attention and ambition.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.415
And they're right.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.833
So now is the time for each
one of us to show leadership.

00:05:53.526 --> 00:05:55.656
Whether you're a farmer in the US,

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.221
a tech owner in China,
a politician in Kenya,

00:05:59.245 --> 00:06:03.157
a banker in Britain,
a fisherman in the Maldives,

00:06:03.181 --> 00:06:08.206
a community leader in Brazil
or a student in India,

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.846
every single one of us has a role to play

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.454
in harnessing whatever
opportunity we have.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.740
I'm committed to using
the unique position that I have

00:06:17.764 --> 00:06:21.092
to help set those Earthshot goals
and reward people

00:06:21.116 --> 00:06:25.257
across every sector of society
and in every part of the world

00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:28.125
who do their bit to help achieve them.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.106
Some people are motivated
to act by a crisis,

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.432
but for many,

00:06:33.456 --> 00:06:38.396
the incentive to act only comes
when they believe that change is possible,

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.183
that it isn't a lost cause.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.396
If people really believe
that these challenges,

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.496
these Earthshots, are possible,

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.983
just imagine all the potential
we will unleash.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.602
I'm determined to both start
and end this decade as an optimist.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.266
Whilst our generation
represents just a blip

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.006
in the lifetime of these magnificent oaks,

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:08.666
we have the power and potential
to ensure that they and all life on earth

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.418
thrive for another
thousand years and more.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:16.615
But only if we now unleash
the greatest talents of our generation

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:18.382
to repair our planet.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.023
We have no choice but to succeed.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.912
Thank you.
