00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:12.105
Flanked by two powerful European nations,
the English Channel

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:16.345
has long been one of the world’s 
most important maritime passages.

00:00:16.345 --> 00:00:17.949
Yet for most of its history,

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.860
the channel’s rocky shores 
and stormy weather

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.930
made crossing a dangerous prospect.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.800
Engineers of the early 1800's 
proposed numerous plans

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.130
for spanning the 33 kilometer gap.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.200
Their designs included artificial islands 
linked by bridges,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.065
submerged tubes suspended 
from floating platforms,

00:00:39.065 --> 00:00:44.479
and an underwater passage more than twice 
the length of any existing tunnel.

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:45.999
By the end of the century,

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:50.150
this last proposal had captured 
European imagination.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.770
The invention 
of the tunnel boring machine

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.236
and the discovery of a stable layer 
of chalk marl below the seabed

00:00:57.236 --> 00:01:00.331
made this fantastic tunnel 
more feasible.

00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:06.210
But the project’s most urgent obstacles 
were ones no engineer could solve.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.160
At the time,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.656
Britons viewed their geographic isolation 
as a strategic advantage,

00:01:11.656 --> 00:01:16.013
and fears about French invasion 
shut down plans for the tunnel.

00:01:16.013 --> 00:01:20.164
The rise of aerial warfare rendered 
these worries obsolete,

00:01:20.164 --> 00:01:24.033
but new economic concerns 
arose to replace them.

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:27.546
Finally, 100 years after 
the initial excavation,

00:01:27.546 --> 00:01:29.816
the two countries 
reached an agreement—

00:01:29.816 --> 00:01:33.206
the tunnel would proceed 
with private funding.

00:01:33.206 --> 00:01:36.807
In 1985, a group 
of French and British companies

00:01:36.807 --> 00:01:40.812
invested the modern equivalent 
of 14 billion pounds,

00:01:40.812 --> 00:01:46.453
making the tunnel the most expensive 
infrastructure project to date.

00:01:46.453 --> 00:01:49.153
The design called 
for three separate tunnels—

00:01:49.153 --> 00:01:52.697
one for trains to France, 
one for trains to England,

00:01:52.697 --> 00:01:55.497
and one service tunnel between them.

00:01:55.497 --> 00:01:59.827
Alongside crossover chambers, 
emergency passages, and air ducts,

00:01:59.827 --> 00:02:04.144
this amounted to over 200 kilometers 
of tunnels.

00:02:04.144 --> 00:02:08.480
In 1988, workers began excavating 
from both sides,

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.808
planning to meet in the middle.

00:02:10.808 --> 00:02:15.769
Early surveys of the French coast 
revealed the site was full of fault lines.

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.299
These small cracks 
let water seep into the rock,

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.159
so engineers had to develop 
waterproof boring machines.

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:28.698
The British anticipated drier conditions, 
and forged ahead with regular borers.

00:02:28.698 --> 00:02:34.112
But only months into the work, water 
flooded in through undetected fissures.

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:37.752
To drill in this wet chalk, 
the British had to use grout

00:02:37.752 --> 00:02:40.979
to seal the cracks 
created in the borer’s wake,

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:43.379
and even work ahead of the main borer

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.649
to reinforce the chalk 
about to be drilled.

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:52.141
With these obstacles behind them, 
both teams began drilling at full speed.

00:02:52.141 --> 00:03:00.071
Boring machines weighing up to 1,300 tons 
drilled at nearly 3.5 meters per hour.

00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:05.403
As they dug, they installed lining rings 
to stabilize the tunnel behind them,

00:03:05.403 --> 00:03:09.473
making way for support wagons 
following each machine.

00:03:09.473 --> 00:03:13.187
Even at top speed, 
work had to proceed carefully.

00:03:13.187 --> 00:03:18.114
The chalk layer followed a winding path 
between unstable rock and clay,

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:23.647
punctured by over 100 boring holes 
made by previous surveyors.

00:03:23.647 --> 00:03:27.617
Furthermore, both teams had 
to constantly check their coordinates

00:03:27.617 --> 00:03:32.431
to ensure they were on track to meet 
within 2 centimeters of each other.

00:03:32.431 --> 00:03:34.711
To maintain this delicate trajectory,

00:03:34.711 --> 00:03:38.459
the borers employed 
satellite positioning systems,

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.429
as well as paleontologists 
who used excavated fossils

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:45.269
to confirm they were at the right depth.

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.829
During construction, 
the project employed over 13,000 people

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.606
and cost the lives of ten workers.

00:03:52.606 --> 00:03:55.309
But after two and a half years 
of tunneling,

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:58.559
the two sides finally made contact.

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:02.089
British worker Graham Fagg 
emerged on the French side,

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:07.519
becoming the first human to cross 
the channel by land since the Ice Age.

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.539
There was still work to be done—

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:12.679
from installing crossover chambers 
and pumping stations,

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:17.399
to laying over a hundred miles of tracks, 
cables, and sensors.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:23.369
But on May 6, 1994, an opening ceremony 
marked the tunnel’s completion.

00:04:23.369 --> 00:04:26.899
Full public service began 
16 months later,

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:31.479
with trains for passengers 
and rail shuttles for cars and trucks.

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.645
Today, the Channel Tunnel services 
over 20 million passengers a year,

00:04:36.645 --> 00:04:41.374
transporting riders across the channel 
in just 35 minutes.

00:04:41.374 --> 00:04:46.395
Unfortunately, not everyone has 
the privilege of making this trip legally.

00:04:46.395 --> 00:04:50.305
Thousands of refugees have tried 
to enter Britain through the tunnel

00:04:50.305 --> 00:04:52.757
in sometimes fatal attempts.

00:04:52.757 --> 00:04:56.287
These tragedies have transformed 
the tunnel’s southern entrance

00:04:56.287 --> 00:04:59.221
into an ongoing site of conflict.

00:04:59.221 --> 00:05:02.661
Hopefully, the structure’s history 
can serve as a reminder

00:05:02.661 --> 00:05:06.391
that humanity is at their best 
when breaking down barriers.
