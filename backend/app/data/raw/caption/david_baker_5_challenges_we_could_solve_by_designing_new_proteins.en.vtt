00:00:12.982 --> 00:00:17.041
I'm going to tell you about the most
amazing machines in the world

00:00:17.065 --> 00:00:18.833
and what we can now do with them.

00:00:19.396 --> 00:00:20.559
Proteins,

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:22.833
some of which you see inside a cell here,

00:00:22.857 --> 00:00:26.316
carry out essentially all the important
functions in our bodies.

00:00:26.972 --> 00:00:28.851
Proteins digest your food,

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:30.581
contract your muscles,

00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:32.182
fire your neurons

00:00:32.206 --> 00:00:33.822
and power your immune system.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.376
Everything that happens in biology --

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.551
almost --

00:00:37.575 --> 00:00:38.987
happens because of proteins.

00:00:39.698 --> 00:00:43.773
Proteins are linear chains
of building blocks called amino acids.

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:47.599
Nature uses an alphabet of 20 amino acids,

00:00:47.623 --> 00:00:49.898
some of which have names
you may have heard of.

00:00:50.921 --> 00:00:54.463
In this picture, for scale,
each bump is an atom.

00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:59.995
Chemical forces between the amino acids
cause these long stringy molecules

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.480
to fold up into unique,
three-dimensional structures.

00:01:03.937 --> 00:01:05.277
The folding process,

00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:06.735
while it looks random,

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:08.722
is in fact very precise.

00:01:08.746 --> 00:01:13.143
Each protein folds
to its characteristic shape each time,

00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:16.555
and the folding process
takes just a fraction of a second.

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:19.873
And it's the shapes of proteins

00:01:19.897 --> 00:01:23.867
which enable them to carry out
their remarkable biological functions.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.671
For example,

00:01:25.695 --> 00:01:29.203
hemoglobin has a shape
in the lungs perfectly suited

00:01:29.227 --> 00:01:31.214
for binding a molecule of oxygen.

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.651
When hemoglobin moves to your muscle,

00:01:33.675 --> 00:01:35.607
the shape changes slightly

00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:37.822
and the oxygen comes out.

00:01:39.494 --> 00:01:40.860
The shapes of proteins,

00:01:40.884 --> 00:01:43.097
and hence their remarkable functions,

00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:48.899
are completely specified by the sequence
of amino acids in the protein chain.

00:01:49.331 --> 00:01:53.272
In this picture, each letter
on top is an amino acid.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.697
Where do these sequences come from?

00:01:57.586 --> 00:02:02.410
The genes in your genome
specify the amino acid sequences

00:02:02.434 --> 00:02:03.832
of your proteins.

00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:07.594
Each gene encodes the amino acid
sequence of a single protein.

00:02:09.515 --> 00:02:13.317
The translation between
these amino acid sequences

00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:15.799
and the structures
and functions of proteins

00:02:15.823 --> 00:02:17.880
is known as the protein folding problem.

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:19.984
It's a very hard problem

00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:23.188
because there's so many different
shapes a protein can adopt.

00:02:24.073 --> 00:02:25.718
Because of this complexity,

00:02:25.742 --> 00:02:28.679
humans have only been able
to harness the power of proteins

00:02:28.703 --> 00:02:32.171
by making very small changes
to the amino acid sequences

00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:34.286
of the proteins we've found in nature.

00:02:34.835 --> 00:02:38.693
This is similar to the process
that our Stone Age ancestors used

00:02:38.717 --> 00:02:42.076
to make tools and other implements
from the sticks and stones

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.103
that we found in the world around us.

00:02:45.226 --> 00:02:50.250
But humans did not learn to fly
by modifying birds.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.807
(Laughter)

00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:59.141
Instead, scientists, inspired by birds,
uncovered the principles of aerodynamics.

00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:03.560
Engineers then used those principles
to design custom flying machines.

00:03:04.195 --> 00:03:05.440
In a similar way,

00:03:05.464 --> 00:03:07.406
we've been working for a number of years

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.699
to uncover the fundamental
principles of protein folding

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:14.782
and encoding those principles
in the computer program called Rosetta.

00:03:15.742 --> 00:03:18.255
We made a breakthrough in recent years.

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:23.488
We can now design completely new proteins
from scratch on the computer.

00:03:24.396 --> 00:03:26.464
Once we've designed the new protein,

00:03:27.242 --> 00:03:31.145
we encode its amino acid sequence
in a synthetic gene.

00:03:31.656 --> 00:03:33.544
We have to make a synthetic gene

00:03:33.568 --> 00:03:35.819
because since the protein
is completely new,

00:03:35.843 --> 00:03:40.605
there's no gene in any organism on earth
which currently exists that encodes it.

00:03:41.697 --> 00:03:45.884
Our advances in understanding
protein folding

00:03:45.908 --> 00:03:47.630
and how to design proteins,

00:03:47.654 --> 00:03:51.282
coupled with the decreasing cost
of gene synthesis

00:03:51.306 --> 00:03:54.805
and the Moore's law increase
in computing power,

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.565
now enable us to design
tens of thousands of new proteins,

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:01.928
with new shapes and new functions,

00:04:01.952 --> 00:04:03.465
on the computer,

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.404
and encode each one of those
in a synthetic gene.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:09.916
Once we have those synthetic genes,

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.485
we put them into bacteria

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:14.814
to program them to make
these brand-new proteins.

00:04:15.197 --> 00:04:17.270
We then extract the proteins

00:04:17.294 --> 00:04:20.730
and determine whether they function
as we designed them to

00:04:20.754 --> 00:04:22.165
and whether they're safe.

00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:26.332
It's exciting to be able
to make new proteins,

00:04:26.356 --> 00:04:28.852
because despite the diversity in nature,

00:04:28.876 --> 00:04:34.968
evolution has only sampled a tiny fraction
of the total number of proteins possible.

00:04:35.572 --> 00:04:39.067
I told you that nature uses
an alphabet of 20 amino acids,

00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:43.540
and a typical protein is a chain
of about 100 amino acids,

00:04:43.564 --> 00:04:49.116
so the total number of possibilities
is 20 times 20 times 20, 100 times,

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:52.957
which is a number on the order
of 10 to the 130th power,

00:04:52.981 --> 00:04:56.793
which is enormously more
than the total number of proteins

00:04:56.817 --> 00:04:59.233
which have existed
since life on earth began.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.681
And it's this unimaginably large space

00:05:02.705 --> 00:05:06.235
we can now explore
using computational protein design.

00:05:07.747 --> 00:05:10.116
Now the proteins that exist on earth

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.133
evolved to solve the problems
faced by natural evolution.

00:05:14.705 --> 00:05:17.058
For example, replicating the genome.

00:05:18.128 --> 00:05:20.412
But we face new challenges today.

00:05:20.436 --> 00:05:23.173
We live longer, so new
diseases are important.

00:05:23.197 --> 00:05:25.412
We're heating up and polluting the planet,

00:05:25.436 --> 00:05:28.994
so we face a whole host
of ecological challenges.

00:05:29.977 --> 00:05:31.785
If we had a million years to wait,

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:35.017
new proteins might evolve
to solve those challenges.

00:05:35.787 --> 00:05:37.846
But we don't have
millions of years to wait.

00:05:38.488 --> 00:05:41.359
Instead, with computational
protein design,

00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:45.822
we can design new proteins
to address these challenges today.

00:05:47.693 --> 00:05:52.143
Our audacious idea is to bring
biology out of the Stone Age

00:05:52.167 --> 00:05:55.142
through technological revolution
in protein design.

00:05:56.113 --> 00:05:58.977
We've already shown
that we can design new proteins

00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:00.684
with new shapes and functions.

00:06:01.174 --> 00:06:05.482
For example, vaccines work
by stimulating your immune system

00:06:05.506 --> 00:06:08.628
to make a strong response
against a pathogen.

00:06:09.698 --> 00:06:11.249
To make better vaccines,

00:06:11.273 --> 00:06:13.575
we've designed protein particles

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:17.186
to which we can fuse
proteins from pathogens,

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.544
like this blue protein here,
from the respiratory virus RSV.

00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:23.861
To make vaccine candidates

00:06:23.885 --> 00:06:27.548
that are literally bristling
with the viral protein,

00:06:27.572 --> 00:06:30.142
we find that such vaccine candidates

00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:33.468
produce a much stronger
immune response to the virus

00:06:33.492 --> 00:06:36.195
than any previous vaccines
that have been tested.

00:06:36.648 --> 00:06:40.498
This is important because RSV
is currently one of the leading causes

00:06:40.522 --> 00:06:42.751
of infant mortality worldwide.

00:06:44.414 --> 00:06:48.377
We've also designed new proteins
to break down gluten in your stomach

00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:49.998
for celiac disease

00:06:50.022 --> 00:06:54.398
and other proteins to stimulate
your immune system to fight cancer.

00:06:55.338 --> 00:06:59.277
These advances are the beginning
of the protein design revolution.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.040
We've been inspired by a previous
technological revolution:

00:07:04.064 --> 00:07:05.409
the digital revolution,

00:07:05.433 --> 00:07:10.558
which took place in large part
due to advances in one place,

00:07:10.582 --> 00:07:11.854
Bell Laboratories.

00:07:12.337 --> 00:07:15.631
Bell Labs was a place with an open,
collaborative environment,

00:07:15.655 --> 00:07:18.838
and was able to attract top talent
from around the world.

00:07:19.418 --> 00:07:22.860
And this led to a remarkable
string of innovations --

00:07:22.884 --> 00:07:27.075
the transistor, the laser,
satellite communication

00:07:27.099 --> 00:07:28.825
and the foundations of the internet.

00:07:29.761 --> 00:07:33.602
Our goal is to build
the Bell Laboratories of protein design.

00:07:34.076 --> 00:07:37.591
We are seeking to attract
talented scientists from around the world

00:07:37.615 --> 00:07:40.550
to accelerate the protein
design revolution,

00:07:40.574 --> 00:07:44.662
and we'll be focusing
on five grand challenges.

00:07:46.136 --> 00:07:51.733
First, by taking proteins from flu strains
from around the world

00:07:51.757 --> 00:07:55.311
and putting them on top
of the designed protein particles

00:07:55.335 --> 00:07:57.002
I showed you earlier,

00:07:57.026 --> 00:08:00.416
we aim to make a universal flu vaccine,

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.391
one shot of which gives a lifetime
of protection against the flu.

00:08:05.356 --> 00:08:06.968
The ability to design --

00:08:06.992 --> 00:08:12.216
(Applause)

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.308
The ability to design
new vaccines on the computer

00:08:15.332 --> 00:08:20.640
is important both to protect
against natural flu epidemics

00:08:20.664 --> 00:08:24.144
and, in addition, intentional
acts of bioterrorism.

00:08:25.272 --> 00:08:28.562
Second, we're going far beyond
nature's limited alphabet

00:08:28.586 --> 00:08:30.297
of just 20 amino acids

00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:35.056
to design new therapeutic candidates
for conditions such as chronic pain,

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.711
using an alphabet
of thousands of amino acids.

00:08:38.602 --> 00:08:42.415
Third, we're building
advanced delivery vehicles

00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:46.603
to target existing medications
exactly where they need to go in the body.

00:08:47.226 --> 00:08:49.875
For example, chemotherapy to a tumor

00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:54.202
or gene therapies to the tissue
where gene repair needs to take place.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.532
Fourth, we're designing smart therapeutics
that can do calculations within the body

00:09:01.556 --> 00:09:03.770
and go far beyond current medicines,

00:09:03.794 --> 00:09:06.058
which are really blunt instruments.

00:09:06.082 --> 00:09:10.431
For example, to target a small
subset of immune cells

00:09:10.455 --> 00:09:12.536
responsible for an autoimmune disorder,

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.018
and distinguish them from the vast
majority of healthy immune cells.

00:09:16.899 --> 00:09:20.311
Finally, inspired by remarkable
biological materials

00:09:20.335 --> 00:09:25.443
such as silk, abalone shell,
tooth and others,

00:09:25.467 --> 00:09:28.351
we're designing new
protein-based materials

00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:32.538
to address challenges in energy
and ecological issues.

00:09:33.558 --> 00:09:36.403
To do all this,
we're growing our institute.

00:09:36.768 --> 00:09:42.367
We seek to attract energetic,
talented and diverse scientists

00:09:42.391 --> 00:09:45.471
from around the world,
at all career stages,

00:09:45.495 --> 00:09:46.645
to join us.

00:09:47.304 --> 00:09:50.607
You can also participate
in the protein design revolution

00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:54.375
through our online
folding and design game, "Foldit."

00:09:55.214 --> 00:09:59.065
And through our distributed
computing project, Rosetta@home,

00:09:59.089 --> 00:10:02.820
which you can join from your laptop
or your Android smartphone.

00:10:04.547 --> 00:10:08.514
Making the world a better place
through protein design is my life's work.

00:10:08.996 --> 00:10:11.274
I'm so excited about
what we can do together.

00:10:11.583 --> 00:10:13.053
I hope you'll join us,

00:10:13.077 --> 00:10:14.235
and thank you.

00:10:14.259 --> 00:10:18.714
(Applause and cheers)
