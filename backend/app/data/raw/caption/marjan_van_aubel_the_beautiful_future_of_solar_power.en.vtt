00:00:13.917 --> 00:00:17.851
Last summer, I was hiking
through the Austrian mountains.

00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:22.559
And there, on top, I saw
this beautiful, stone, remote hut,

00:00:22.583 --> 00:00:24.768
and it had solar panels on it.

00:00:24.792 --> 00:00:28.601
And every time I see solar panels,
I get very enthusiastic.

00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:32.601
It's this technology that takes sunlight,
which is free and available,

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:34.500
and turns that into electricity.

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:39.643
So this hut, in the middle of nowhere,
on a beautiful location,

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:40.917
was self-sufficient.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.476
But why do solar panels
always have to be so ugly?

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.684
(Laughter)

00:00:47.708 --> 00:00:50.684
My name is Marjan Van Aubel
and I'm a solar designer.

00:00:50.708 --> 00:00:55.351
I work in the triangle of design,
sustainability and technology.

00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:58.726
I strive for extreme efficiency,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.809
meaning that I develop materials
that expand in size

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:05.684
or work with solar cells
that use the properties of colors

00:01:05.708 --> 00:01:06.958
to generate electricity.

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:11.351
My work is in museums
all over the world, such as MoMA.

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:14.851
And, I mean, it all went quite well,

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:17.458
but it always felt
that something was missing.

00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:22.851
And it was, until I read the book
called the "Solar Revolution,"

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:27.393
where it says that within one hour
we receive enough sunlight

00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:29.684
to provide the world
with enough electricity

00:01:29.708 --> 00:01:31.167
for an entire year.

00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:34.059
One hour.

00:01:34.083 --> 00:01:38.351
And since then, I realized
I just want to focus on solar.

00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:39.851
Scientists all over the world

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:44.601
have been focusing on making
solar panels more efficient and cheaper.

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:47.476
So the price of solar
has dropped enormously.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.167
And this is because China
started producing them on a large scale.

00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:56.018
And also their efficiency
has increased a lot.

00:01:56.042 --> 00:01:59.875
They now even have an efficiency
of 44.5 percent.

00:02:01.292 --> 00:02:04.559
But if you think
about the image of solar cells,

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:07.958
it's kind of stayed the same
for the last 60 years.

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:12.542
It's still this technology
just stacked onto something.

00:02:13.708 --> 00:02:17.500
And solar cells need to be much better
integrated into our environment.

00:02:19.292 --> 00:02:22.768
Climate change is the biggest
problem of our time.

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:25.976
And we can't rely on the others --
the government, the engineers --

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.351
to make positive changes.

00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:29.875
We all can contribute towards change.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.518
Like I said, I'm a designer

00:02:32.542 --> 00:02:35.042
and I would like to change
things through design.

00:02:36.458 --> 00:02:39.184
Let me give you some examples of my work.

00:02:39.208 --> 00:02:42.643
I'm collaborating with Swarovski,
the crystal company.

00:02:42.667 --> 00:02:45.018
And if you cut crystals in a certain way,

00:02:45.042 --> 00:02:49.268
you are able to bend and direct the light
onto a certain place.

00:02:49.292 --> 00:02:53.268
So I use these crystals
to focus the light onto a solar panel,

00:02:53.292 --> 00:02:56.083
making them more efficient,
but using aesthetics.

00:02:57.125 --> 00:02:59.601
So you take the solar crystal
with you in the light,

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:01.726
there's a battery in the solar cell,

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.476
you put it in a docking station

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.893
and you are able to power
these chandeliers.

00:03:05.917 --> 00:03:08.333
So you're literally
bringing the light indoors.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.018
I got completely hooked on solar
when I came across this technology

00:03:14.042 --> 00:03:17.268
called dye-sensitized solar cells,

00:03:17.292 --> 00:03:18.559
colored solar cells,

00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:21.708
and they are based
on photosynthesis in plants.

00:03:22.667 --> 00:03:26.059
Where the green chlorophyl
converts light into sugar for plants,

00:03:26.083 --> 00:03:28.667
these cells convert light
into electricity.

00:03:31.042 --> 00:03:33.833
The best thing is, they even work indoors.

00:03:34.792 --> 00:03:36.976
So different colors
have different efficiency,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.191
depending on their place
on the color spectrum.

00:03:39.215 --> 00:03:43.132
So, for example,
red is more efficient than blue.

00:03:44.708 --> 00:03:46.684
So if I hear this as a designer:

00:03:46.708 --> 00:03:49.726
a colored surface,
a glass colored surface,

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.434
color that's mostly
just used for esthetics,

00:03:52.458 --> 00:03:56.851
now gets an extra function
and is able to harvest electricity,

00:03:56.875 --> 00:04:00.059
I think, where can we apply this, then?

00:04:00.083 --> 00:04:01.851
This is Current Table,

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:05.625
where the whole tabletop
consists of these colored solar cells.

00:04:06.667 --> 00:04:08.351
There are batteries in the legs

00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:11.333
where you can charge your phone
through USB ports.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.059
And in my work,
it's always very important,

00:04:15.083 --> 00:04:17.393
the balance between
efficiency and aesthetics.

00:04:17.417 --> 00:04:19.037
So that's why the table is orange,

00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:21.977
because it is a very stable
color for indoors.

00:04:24.042 --> 00:04:26.393
And this is always
the most asked question I get:

00:04:26.417 --> 00:04:29.333
"OK, great, but how many phones
can I charge from this, then?"

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.934
And before I go to this
complicated answer of like,

00:04:32.958 --> 00:04:35.476
"Well, where is the table,
does it have enough light,

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.059
is it next to a window?"

00:04:37.083 --> 00:04:40.976
The table now has sensors
that read the light intensity of the room.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.934
So through an app we developed

00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.476
you can literally follow
how much light it's getting,

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.250
and how full the battery is.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.226
I'm actually proud,
because yesterday we installed a table

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.934
at Stichting Doen's offices in Amsterdam

00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:56.226
and, right at this moment,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.018
our Queen Maxima is charging
a phone from this table.

00:05:00.042 --> 00:05:01.351
It's cool.

00:05:01.375 --> 00:05:06.268
(Applause)

00:05:06.292 --> 00:05:10.476
So the more surface you have,
the more energy you can harvest.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.101
These are Current Windows,

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:16.976
where we replaced all windows
in a gallery in London, in Soho,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.101
with this modern version of stained glass.

00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:23.101
So people from the street
could come and charge their phones

00:05:23.125 --> 00:05:24.458
through the window ledges.

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:28.059
So I'm giving extra functions to objects.

00:05:28.083 --> 00:05:30.601
A window doesn't have to be
just a window anymore.

00:05:30.625 --> 00:05:33.625
It can also function
as a little power station.

00:05:35.583 --> 00:05:40.309
So, here I am, talking
about how much I love solar,

00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:43.268
but I don't have solar panels on my roof.

00:05:43.292 --> 00:05:45.018
I live in the center of Amsterdam,

00:05:45.042 --> 00:05:47.059
I don't own the house and it's a monument,

00:05:47.083 --> 00:05:49.292
so it's not possible and not allowed.

00:05:50.542 --> 00:05:54.684
So how can you make solar cells
more accessible and for everyone,

00:05:54.708 --> 00:05:58.083
and not only for the people
that can afford a sustainable lifestyle?

00:05:59.708 --> 00:06:01.184
We now have the opportunity

00:06:01.208 --> 00:06:04.476
to integrate solar on the place
where we directly need it.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.934
And there are so many
amazing technologies out there.

00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:11.625
If I look around now,
I see every surface as an opportunity.

00:06:13.167 --> 00:06:16.101
For example, I was driving
in the train through the Westland,

00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:19.434
the area in the Netherlands
with all the greenhouses.

00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:22.018
There I saw all this glass and thought,

00:06:22.042 --> 00:06:25.726
what if we integrate those
with transparent solar glass?

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.559
What if we integrate traditional farming

00:06:28.583 --> 00:06:31.309
that requires a lot of energy

00:06:31.333 --> 00:06:35.309
together with high-tech and combine those?

00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:37.958
With this idea in mind,
I created Power Plant.

00:06:40.542 --> 00:06:43.976
I had a team of architects and engineers,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.208
but let me first explain how it works.

00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:49.809
We use transparent solar glass

00:06:49.833 --> 00:06:52.143
to power its indoor climate.

00:06:52.167 --> 00:06:55.143
We use hydroponics
that pumps around nutrified water,

00:06:55.167 --> 00:06:57.750
saving 90 percent of water usage.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.292
By stacking up in layers, you are able
to grow more yield per square meter.

00:07:03.375 --> 00:07:07.809
Extra light, besides sunlight,
coming from these colored LED lights

00:07:07.833 --> 00:07:09.625
also enhances plant growth.

00:07:11.542 --> 00:07:14.184
As more and more people
will live in big cities,

00:07:14.208 --> 00:07:16.768
by placing Power Plants on the rooftops

00:07:16.792 --> 00:07:19.684
you don't have to fly it in
from the other side of the world,

00:07:19.708 --> 00:07:21.917
you are able to grow it
on the location itself.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.934
Well, the big dream is
to build these in off-grid places --

00:07:25.958 --> 00:07:28.601
where there's no access
to water, electricity --

00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:30.542
as an independent ecosystem.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.059
For this year's Design Biennial,

00:07:35.083 --> 00:07:39.143
I created the first four-meter high
model of the power plant,

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:42.167
so you could come in
and experience how plants grow.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.018
So it's a double harvest of sunlight,

00:07:46.042 --> 00:07:49.875
so both for the solar cells
and for the plants.

00:07:51.083 --> 00:07:54.643
It's like a future botanical garden,

00:07:54.667 --> 00:07:57.708
where we celebrate
all these modern technologies.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.500
And the biggest compliment I got was,
"But where are the solar panels?"

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.601
And that's when I think
design really works,

00:08:05.625 --> 00:08:08.083
when it becomes invisible
and you don't notice it.

00:08:10.333 --> 00:08:12.393
I believe in solar democracy:

00:08:12.417 --> 00:08:16.059
solar energy for everyone, everywhere.

00:08:16.083 --> 00:08:19.393
My aim is to make all surfaces productive.

00:08:19.417 --> 00:08:23.101
I want to build houses
where all the windows, curtains, walls,

00:08:23.125 --> 00:08:26.143
even floors are harvesting electricity.

00:08:26.167 --> 00:08:27.726
Think about this on a big scale:

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:31.083
in cities, there are so many surfaces.

00:08:32.792 --> 00:08:35.684
The sun is still available for everyone.

00:08:35.708 --> 00:08:38.309
And by integrating solar
on the place where we need it,

00:08:38.333 --> 00:08:42.417
we now have the opportunity to make
solar cells accessible for everyone.

00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:47.683
I want to bring solar
close to the people with you,

00:08:47.707 --> 00:08:50.332
but beautiful and well designed.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:52.417
Thank you.
