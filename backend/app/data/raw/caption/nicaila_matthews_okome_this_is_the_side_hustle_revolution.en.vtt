00:00:00.067 --> 00:00:02.853
I can't think of anyone
who just has one interest in life,

00:00:02.877 --> 00:00:04.996
and that's all they want to do
for the rest of their life.

00:00:05.021 --> 00:00:07.908
[The Way We Work]

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:13.885
Around 15 percent of American workers
don't have traditional full-time jobs.

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:17.092
They're half-time, part-time,
contract workers or temps.

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:20.941
The term "side hustle"
just seems to fit with this ethos

00:00:20.965 --> 00:00:24.501
where people are putting together
a few different things to make a living.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:28.848
The word "side hustle" has its roots
in popular African American newspapers.

00:00:28.872 --> 00:00:32.501
In the 1920s, these papers
used the word "hustle"

00:00:32.525 --> 00:00:34.097
to refer to some kind of scam.

00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:37.025
By the 1950s, they were
using "side hustle"

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:39.302
to refer to legitimate work, too.

00:00:39.326 --> 00:00:42.026
A side hustle is a little different
than a second job.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.755
A second job is about necessity.

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:46.769
While a side hustle can certainly
bring in extra income,

00:00:46.793 --> 00:00:48.509
it's a little more aspirational.

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:52.374
Side hustle captures a certain kind
of scrappy, entrepreneurial spirit.

00:00:52.398 --> 00:00:54.937
I've interviewed more than
100 women of color

00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:56.136
on Side Hustle Pro

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.041
who started successful side hustles.

00:00:58.065 --> 00:01:01.248
Nailah Ellis-Brown started
Ellis Island Tea out of her trunk.

00:01:01.272 --> 00:01:04.776
Arsha Jones started her famous
Capital City Co Mambo Sauce

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.779
with one product and a PayPal link.

00:01:06.803 --> 00:01:08.811
All these women are running side hustles.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:10.962
What exactly does this tell us?

00:01:10.986 --> 00:01:14.922
First, that people are seeing opportunity
within their communities.

00:01:14.946 --> 00:01:19.019
The goal here isn't necessarily
to be the next Coca-Cola or Google.

00:01:19.043 --> 00:01:22.589
Scale is great, but there's also beauty
in a successful business

00:01:22.613 --> 00:01:25.403
that's built for a specific audience.

00:01:25.427 --> 00:01:29.089
Second, people are increasingly interested
in being their own boss.

00:01:29.113 --> 00:01:31.271
Being your own boss takes discipline.

00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:34.770
Self-made millionaires tend to have
one big trait in common:

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:37.389
they make decisions,
hold themselves accountable

00:01:37.414 --> 00:01:39.886
and push through
in the face of challenges.

00:01:39.911 --> 00:01:43.825
A side hustle is a great way
to try out being your own boss

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:47.541
and see if you have those skills
before fully stepping out on your own.

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:49.964
Third, people are multipassionate.

00:01:49.988 --> 00:01:53.421
I want to stress that not every
side hustle is started

00:01:53.445 --> 00:01:55.009
because someone hates their job.

00:01:55.084 --> 00:01:58.044
Many are started simply
because people are interested

00:01:58.068 --> 00:01:59.558
in lots of different things.

00:01:59.582 --> 00:02:02.868
Lisa Price, who started a hair
and beauty company, Carol's Daughter,

00:02:02.892 --> 00:02:06.114
was working in television production
when she started side-hustling.

00:02:06.138 --> 00:02:07.986
She says she actually loved her job.

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.240
It was the fact that she came home
every day feeling good

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:13.010
that led her to start experimenting

00:02:13.034 --> 00:02:15.677
with making fragrances
and hair oils in her kitchen.

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:16.919
We're always being taught

00:02:16.943 --> 00:02:19.939
that we're supposed to know
what we want to do when we grow up.

00:02:19.963 --> 00:02:21.519
But when you're multipassionate,

00:02:21.543 --> 00:02:24.042
you want to dip and dabble
in those different things.

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:26.792
It doesn't mean that you're not
committed to your job,

00:02:26.816 --> 00:02:29.907
it just means that you have
other outlets that bring you joy.

00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:34.216
And that brings me to the final thing
the side hustle revolution shows us:

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.653
people want to make a bet on themselves.

00:02:36.677 --> 00:02:40.225
Side hustles are appealing
because it's easier to take that chance

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:42.392
when you have some kind
of income coming in.

00:02:42.416 --> 00:02:44.623
Even if a side hustle doesn't take off,

00:02:44.647 --> 00:02:46.559
it's still an investment in yourself.

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:49.701
Forty-one percent of millennials
who have a side hustle

00:02:49.725 --> 00:02:52.407
say they've shared this information
with their employers.

00:02:52.431 --> 00:02:55.393
They're not worried about
their managers reacting negatively.

00:02:55.417 --> 00:02:59.900
They recognize all the learning and growth
that comes with running a side hustle.

00:02:59.924 --> 00:03:01.853
Everyone is looking to feel fulfilled.

00:03:01.877 --> 00:03:05.750
Thirty-eight percent of baby boomers feel
some kind of regret about their career.

00:03:05.774 --> 00:03:06.942
No one wants that.

00:03:06.966 --> 00:03:10.129
The truth is that there are
many different ways to find happiness

00:03:10.153 --> 00:03:11.307
through what we do.

00:03:11.331 --> 00:03:13.455
Side hustles are about embracing that hope

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.058
that we can be the ones
making the decisions

00:03:16.082 --> 00:03:18.273
in how we spend our work lives.
