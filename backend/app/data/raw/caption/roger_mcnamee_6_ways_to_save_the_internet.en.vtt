00:00:01.847 --> 00:00:05.217
Good morning!

00:00:05.217 --> 00:00:07.342
Have you ever been in the position of

00:00:07.342 --> 00:00:11.598
watching Silicon Valley take off and wish

00:00:11.598 --> 00:00:14.452
that you had known what was about to happen?

00:00:14.452 --> 00:00:18.305
(Laughter)

00:00:18.305 --> 00:00:20.849
So, I'm here to talk about what I think

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.130
is going to be the most intense disruption

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.827
of the technology world that's
occurred in the last 15 years.

00:00:28.827 --> 00:00:32.164
And I believe the end product of it

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:35.016
will be entirely a bad engagement.

00:00:35.016 --> 00:00:39.008
In fact, I think it is possibly a transformational change

00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:41.686
in the way we're going to think about engagement.

00:00:41.686 --> 00:00:48.105
So what would you do if you knew, today,

00:00:48.105 --> 00:00:50.254
that there was going to be a major technology cycle

00:00:50.254 --> 00:00:52.111
beginning in the next couple of years,

00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:54.969
and that you could participate in it?

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.164
What would you do?

00:00:57.164 --> 00:00:58.846
(Audience) Jump in.

00:00:58.846 --> 00:01:02.607
So, this is the situation in which I find myself:

00:01:02.607 --> 00:01:06.690
I'm a professional investor about half the day,

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.133
the daylight half. I was paying close attention earlier

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.853
and I now know I need to have 10 hours sleep at night,

00:01:12.853 --> 00:01:15.500
which is tricky, because last night the show ended

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.406
about 12:30, and so I was, I got --

00:01:18.406 --> 00:01:21.835
and that was in Santa Rosa,
so I got home a little late.

00:01:21.835 --> 00:01:23.756
I want you to understand
that I've been studying the

00:01:23.756 --> 00:01:27.270
technology world and things
have already begun to change.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.291
But they're changing in ways that I see,

00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:32.506
literally no commentator referring to today.

00:01:32.506 --> 00:01:34.825
There're six things going on that I'm going to focus on.

00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:36.540
And I want you to understand, each one of these

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.967
is a hypothesis, it is subject to revision.

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:42.352
It may even be subject to elimination.

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:43.957
But I want you to understand I've been working

00:01:43.957 --> 00:01:47.168
with this group of hypotheses now for about 10 months,

00:01:47.168 --> 00:01:49.337
and what's really interesting is that I've been

00:01:49.337 --> 00:01:52.974
exposing them to a lot of people in the industry and

00:01:52.974 --> 00:01:55.269
people have been finding it very hard to debunk them.

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:57.367
So I'm going to share them with you today, because

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:00.426
I think collectively we have a chance to figure this out.

00:02:00.426 --> 00:02:03.667
The first thing, and I think this is fairly obvious,

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:06.002
is Windows is dying, and --

00:02:06.002 --> 00:02:08.786
(Applause)

00:02:08.786 --> 00:02:11.248
I mean no disrespect to Microsoft because I think,

00:02:11.248 --> 00:02:12.973
in fact, Microsoft as a company,

00:02:12.973 --> 00:02:15.721
has many things it can do to maintain growth,

00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:18.298
but desktops would not be one of them.

00:02:18.298 --> 00:02:21.676
And the key indicator here, the only one you need to know,

00:02:21.676 --> 00:02:25.704
to understand what's going on here

00:02:25.704 --> 00:02:29.608
is that smartphones have basically taken Windows

00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:32.296
from 96% of Internet connected devices

00:02:32.296 --> 00:02:36.647
3 or 4 years ago to under 50% now.

00:02:36.647 --> 00:02:39.561
And it is falling precipitously, that'll be under 30%

00:02:39.561 --> 00:02:42.843
probably a year and a half from now.

00:02:42.843 --> 00:02:44.963
Microsoft has lots of things it can do.

00:02:44.963 --> 00:02:47.816
It can retreat to exchange and crank the price there.

00:02:47.816 --> 00:02:51.764
But the reason this is so significant is that Windows

00:02:51.764 --> 00:02:54.042
and enterprise software, which is related to it,

00:02:54.042 --> 00:02:57.812
think SAP and people like that, those businesses

00:02:57.812 --> 00:03:00.959
account for hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue.

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.266
And I'm suggesting we're going to have
a jump off of their revenue.

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:09.098
And in a world where the U.S. economy
is not growing that rapidly,

00:03:09.098 --> 00:03:12.145
having somebody go away is the simplest way

00:03:12.145 --> 00:03:14.330
to create room for new industries.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.947
And this is where the revenues are going to come from.

00:03:16.947 --> 00:03:18.214
But guess what!

00:03:18.214 --> 00:03:22.460
Like a Ginsu knife commercial, there's more!

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.734
It turns out Microsoft is not the only company

00:03:25.734 --> 00:03:30.614
whose body is lying across the railroad tracks today.

00:03:30.614 --> 00:03:33.466
Another one is Google.

00:03:33.466 --> 00:03:35.620
Now you may not have focused on this,

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.528
but index search accounted for 90%

00:03:38.528 --> 00:03:42.207
of all search volume about 4 years ago.

00:03:42.207 --> 00:03:45.517
But an interesting thing happened: Google got to be

00:03:45.517 --> 00:03:49.987
so successful that the index became fool of garbage.

00:03:49.987 --> 00:03:54.592
In fact, the entire Web has become full of garbage.

00:03:54.592 --> 00:03:56.335
If you think about it, the Web has become

00:03:56.335 --> 00:03:59.150
almost a digital Detroit. (Laughter)

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.581
If you look hard enough,

00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:04.618
you can find really compelling things there.

00:04:04.618 --> 00:04:08.146
But if you aren't really careful, you can get mugged.

00:04:08.146 --> 00:04:09.936
(Laughter)

00:04:09.936 --> 00:04:12.662
And it is no shock that each one of us

00:04:12.662 --> 00:04:14.415
and everyone else out there have looked

00:04:14.415 --> 00:04:17.600
for other ways to find the things we want to find.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.974
We started with Wikipedia, but then Facebook

00:04:19.974 --> 00:04:22.920
came along for matters of taste and money;

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.041
Twitter came along for real time news;

00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:27.036
LinkedIn for professional things;

00:04:27.036 --> 00:04:29.492
Match.com for less professional things;

00:04:29.492 --> 00:04:32.485
TripAdvisor for travel, Yelp for restaurants,

00:04:32.485 --> 00:04:34.856
Realtor.com for finding a home,

00:04:34.856 --> 00:04:36.417
Dictionary.com for words,

00:04:36.417 --> 00:04:38.839
Wordnik for the whole language.

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:40.807
So the thing has really changed.

00:04:40.807 --> 00:04:42.076
And here's what's interesting.

00:04:42.076 --> 00:04:44.468
Like Microsoft, Google has plenty of ways

00:04:44.468 --> 00:04:46.981
to respond in terms of growing its business.

00:04:46.981 --> 00:04:50.571
But what it cannot do is recover its position

00:04:50.571 --> 00:04:53.304
as the dominant player on the Internet.

00:04:53.304 --> 00:04:57.235
It is my belief that when Google came along in 1998,

00:04:57.235 --> 00:05:00.179
the Internet was an open-source,

00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:02.880
long-tail world with no leader.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.135
And Google stepped into this void, provided leadership

00:05:06.135 --> 00:05:09.322
and implemented a strategy that systematically

00:05:09.322 --> 00:05:12.073
commoditized all forms of content.

00:05:12.073 --> 00:05:13.848
And the simplest way to look at

00:05:13.848 --> 00:05:15.717
is look at the Google results page:

00:05:15.717 --> 00:05:19.019
the only logo on that page is Google's,

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:21.963
everything else is in the same font.

00:05:21.963 --> 00:05:24.548
That form of commoditization has been tremendous

00:05:24.548 --> 00:05:27.383
for Google and horrible for almost everyone else.

00:05:27.383 --> 00:05:30.745
And I believe to a first order, it is over.

00:05:30.745 --> 00:05:33.118
Not because index search is going away, but because

00:05:33.118 --> 00:05:36.417
like word processing, it's gone from the most important

00:05:36.417 --> 00:05:40.318
application we all had, to just another thing we do.

00:05:40.318 --> 00:05:42.686
And you see this in mobile in particular.

00:05:42.686 --> 00:05:45.275
Because in mobile, people have found

00:05:45.275 --> 00:05:47.464
other ways to find what they want.

00:05:47.464 --> 00:05:50.633
Index search is too disruptive on a cell phone,

00:05:50.633 --> 00:05:53.367
so the rate of index search is a small fraction

00:05:53.367 --> 00:05:56.014
on cell phones to what it is on desktops.

00:05:56.014 --> 00:06:00.151
And that is the leading indicator that Google's recovery,

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:03.782
if you will, will be in something other than search.

00:06:03.782 --> 00:06:08.852
The third hypothesis I have is no longer controversial,

00:06:08.852 --> 00:06:11.170
but it's important to understand what happened.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.912
If the left hand side of this equation is the open-source

00:06:13.912 --> 00:06:16.417
World Wide Web, with its belief in the long tail,

00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:18.829
its belief in an absence of regulation,

00:06:18.829 --> 00:06:21.256
of an absence of security and control,

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:22.946
it's really off frontier.

00:06:22.946 --> 00:06:25.835
Apple came along with a different vision.

00:06:25.835 --> 00:06:27.624
They said, "We think the Web is dead.

00:06:27.624 --> 00:06:29.021
We're going to go on the Internet,

00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:30.419
because that's the big data store,

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.323
and we're going to provide you with branded,

00:06:33.323 --> 00:06:40.036
thoughtful, value-added, copyright-protected content."

00:06:40.036 --> 00:06:42.798
And people have overwhelmingly chosen that

00:06:42.798 --> 00:06:44.700
over Google's vision.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.109
Over the last three years, Apple's gone from being

00:06:48.109 --> 00:06:51.685
an all sovereign in computers to this year they will ship

00:06:51.685 --> 00:06:57.560
approximately 100 million Internet-enabled devices.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.517
100 Million. They'll probably be just short of that.

00:07:01.517 --> 00:07:06.385
The point here is, it's Apple's world.

00:07:06.385 --> 00:07:08.143
We're lucky to be part of it because

00:07:08.143 --> 00:07:10.628
Steve is quite intolerant about who he lets in.

00:07:10.628 --> 00:07:13.432
(Laughter) But think about this:

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:15.253
Imagine George in the Civil War, OK?

00:07:15.253 --> 00:07:19.044
Apple is Sherman, World Wide Web is Joe Johnston.

00:07:19.044 --> 00:07:21.264
And the point is they've lost.

00:07:21.264 --> 00:07:23.312
And the Web is looking at this and going,

00:07:23.312 --> 00:07:26.272
"My God, we've got to come back", and the cost,

00:07:26.272 --> 00:07:29.803
in order to do this, is they have to sacrifice Google.

00:07:29.803 --> 00:07:32.681
So Google has pushed the pendulum of technology

00:07:32.681 --> 00:07:35.828
to the absolute limit of commoditization.

00:07:35.828 --> 00:07:38.626
To the point where people who spent their whole lives

00:07:38.626 --> 00:07:42.087
developing really valuable, compelling entertainment,

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:44.172
and really valuable, compelling journalism,

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:45.937
and really valuable, compelling novels,

00:07:45.937 --> 00:07:48.225
can't make money doing it any more.

00:07:48.225 --> 00:07:53.066
So the website, OK, if Google's over here, and Apple's here,

00:07:53.066 --> 00:07:54.883
HTML 5, the next generation is going to be

00:07:54.883 --> 00:07:56.670
on the other side of Apple.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.934
So the new battle, instead of being commoditization

00:07:58.934 --> 00:08:00.950
versus the AppStore, is going to be between

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.666
the AppStore and highly differentiated content.

00:08:04.666 --> 00:08:06.726
If you don't know what HTML 5 is,

00:08:06.726 --> 00:08:08.042
let me help you understand.

00:08:08.042 --> 00:08:10.667
It is a programming language.

00:08:10.667 --> 00:08:14.590
But it's a profound one. Because for the first time,

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.403
you're going to be able to construct a web page

00:08:17.403 --> 00:08:21.116
where the entire thing can have embedded interactivity,

00:08:21.116 --> 00:08:24.436
can have video, audio, whatever it is that you want.

00:08:24.436 --> 00:08:27.004
But no more flash boxes.

00:08:27.004 --> 00:08:28.624
And it's a huge, huge change.

00:08:28.624 --> 00:08:31.384
Because it essentially opens up a new canvas.

00:08:31.384 --> 00:08:34.424
And it doesn't just open it up for The New York Times,

00:08:34.424 --> 00:08:36.938
it opens it up for everybody on WordPress,

00:08:36.938 --> 00:08:40.667
it opens it up for every band, because suddenly,

00:08:40.667 --> 00:08:43.987
the ability to produce a differentiated, highly compelling,

00:08:43.987 --> 00:08:48.866
value-added, maybe even monetizable product,
will be there.

00:08:48.866 --> 00:08:52.386
And what's really interesting is, thanks to Apple,

00:08:52.386 --> 00:08:56.080
there's nothing that commoditizers can do about you.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.316
Apple may try to stop us, but I don't think they will.

00:08:59.316 --> 00:09:01.588
I think they're smarter than that.

00:09:01.588 --> 00:09:03.213
So the key point is, I don't know where we're going

00:09:03.213 --> 00:09:06.288
to stop, as the pendulum swings back.

00:09:06.288 --> 00:09:09.861
But I think the days of hyper-commoditization are behind us.

00:09:09.861 --> 00:09:11.618
And we can all plan this, and in a moment

00:09:11.618 --> 00:09:14.890
I'm going to tell you how I'm doing it personally.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:16.562
Tablets!

00:09:16.562 --> 00:09:20.056
This is the other side of why Windows is dead.

00:09:20.056 --> 00:09:22.043
If any of you does not own an iPad --

00:09:22.043 --> 00:09:23.964
Look, I don't own in the Apple stock

00:09:23.964 --> 00:09:26.623
so I have nothing, no acts in this but --

00:09:26.623 --> 00:09:30.063
seriously, if you don't own an iPad you can't possibly

00:09:30.063 --> 00:09:32.889
understand the most important things going on now.

00:09:32.889 --> 00:09:35.229
And, no, I'm really serious about this.

00:09:35.229 --> 00:09:37.127
And I think the most important point is that

00:09:37.127 --> 00:09:39.442
the other players on this thing,

00:09:39.442 --> 00:09:42.676
at the moment, have made no impact.

00:09:42.676 --> 00:09:46.278
And keep in mind it was our investment that built

00:09:46.278 --> 00:09:48.870
Palm's WebOS that HP's shipping

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:52.368
soon, eventually, some day. (Laughter)

00:09:52.368 --> 00:09:54.850
I think it's highly probable Apple wins this thing

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.308
with market share closer to what they have on the iPod

00:09:58.308 --> 00:10:01.409
than to what they have on the iPhone.

00:10:01.409 --> 00:10:03.534
That would be 70 or 80%.

00:10:03.534 --> 00:10:05.185
If that's right, Apple's going to be

00:10:05.185 --> 00:10:06.960
50 to 100 billion dollars bigger

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.122
in a few year that they are today.

00:10:10.122 --> 00:10:13.208
And I literally don't see anybody else even challenging them.

00:10:13.208 --> 00:10:14.592
It's really important to understand that

00:10:14.592 --> 00:10:16.878
Apple's cost structure is so favorable,

00:10:16.893 --> 00:10:18.409
relative to everybody else,

00:10:18.409 --> 00:10:20.564
that it's almost impossible to imagine any of

00:10:20.564 --> 00:10:23.211
the cell phone guys, particularly Android guys, catching up.

00:10:23.211 --> 00:10:26.709
Because Apple's gross margins exceed

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:31.262
the retail price of almost every Android phone.

00:10:31.262 --> 00:10:33.436
Here is the one that I want to leave you with

00:10:33.436 --> 00:10:35.771
as an investment idea, first and foremost.

00:10:35.771 --> 00:10:38.513
The mania on Wall Street is about social.

00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:42.464
Social is a side show. And I say this as somebody

00:10:42.464 --> 00:10:46.428
whose fund has most of its money in Facebook.

00:10:46.428 --> 00:10:50.391
It is a one-off. This is not --

00:10:50.391 --> 00:10:52.931
To paraphrase from Star Wars,

00:10:52.931 --> 00:10:56.980
"This is not the mania you're looking for."

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.667
The one we're talking about will be
so much bigger than this.

00:10:59.667 --> 00:11:03.997
Facebook has won, it is the new Windows, OK?

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:08.384
A few other guys, Twitter, Yelp, Skype, LinkedIn

00:11:08.384 --> 00:11:12.182
are building successful platforms that are

00:11:12.182 --> 00:11:15.879
much smaller than what Facebook has.

00:11:15.879 --> 00:11:17.077
And they will be successful.

00:11:17.077 --> 00:11:18.274
But everything else coming along

00:11:18.274 --> 00:11:19.914
is going to have to follow the Zynga model.

00:11:19.914 --> 00:11:21.987
They're going to have to make themselves

00:11:21.987 --> 00:11:24.980
subordinate to the platform of Facebook.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.495
And Zynga's inability to build anything successful

00:11:27.495 --> 00:11:30.197
off of Facebook I think is the key indicator

00:11:30.197 --> 00:11:33.102
of why this platform is so powerful.

00:11:33.102 --> 00:11:34.668
So if you're going to do a start-up today

00:11:34.668 --> 00:11:36.543
in the social world, build it on top of Facebook.

00:11:36.543 --> 00:11:38.183
That's the only piece of advice I can give you.

00:11:38.183 --> 00:11:40.692
But most important piece of advice, forget social!

00:11:40.692 --> 00:11:44.164
Social is now a feature, it's not a platform.

00:11:44.164 --> 00:11:46.710
So embed social, the same way that Catherine said,

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.767
"Embed gamification into everything!"

00:11:49.767 --> 00:11:52.350
It's all about engagement.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:56.937
So the future is going to be different.

00:11:56.937 --> 00:11:58.322
And the core question is,

00:11:58.322 --> 00:12:00.722
"What are we all going to do about it?"

00:12:00.722 --> 00:12:05.275
What I do is very simple:
I believe in full contact investing.

00:12:05.275 --> 00:12:08.597
So I looked at HTML 5 about a year ago and I said,

00:12:08.597 --> 00:12:11.481
"This thing could be really important, how do I find out?"

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:14.400
So my band, Moonalice, which a couple years ago

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.367
did an album with T-Bone Burnett, that we thought

00:12:16.367 --> 00:12:19.734
was going to be a huge hit and bla-bla-bla, well,

00:12:19.734 --> 00:12:22.287
we learned that nobody cared about hippy music

00:12:22.287 --> 00:12:26.275
done by old folks so we put it all onto the net.

00:12:26.275 --> 00:12:28.562
So we went on Facebook and Twitter, and we started

00:12:28.562 --> 00:12:31.130
doing things called twitter-casts, the first live concerts,

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.807
and then prerecorded concerts, distributed over Twitter.

00:12:33.807 --> 00:12:35.400
And then we started using live stream,

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.631
the same thing we're using here today,

00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:39.897
to do Internet-based live video for shows.

00:12:39.897 --> 00:12:43.311
And then, we recently bought a satellite network. Why?

00:12:43.311 --> 00:12:45.497
Because it cost less than three months

00:12:45.497 --> 00:12:48.322
of what our manager used to cost.

00:12:48.322 --> 00:12:51.301
And right now, we broadcast every one of our shows,

00:12:51.301 --> 00:12:55.365
other than the U2 show, live, in HTML 5,

00:12:55.365 --> 00:12:59.475
via satellite, in a system we totally control.

00:12:59.475 --> 00:13:02.616
We have an App that's about to ship

00:13:02.616 --> 00:13:05.751
within the next month. It's App's own term.

00:13:05.751 --> 00:13:07.832
Our website is being upgraded to HTML 5.

00:13:07.832 --> 00:13:11.998
And in it, you will be able, from any phone, anywhere,

00:13:11.998 --> 00:13:14.764
to play any song we've ever played live

00:13:14.764 --> 00:13:16.775
and view any live video that we have,

00:13:16.775 --> 00:13:19.755
which is 150-200 shows.

00:13:19.755 --> 00:13:23.231
Now, it cost practically nothing to do this.

00:13:23.231 --> 00:13:26.615
And we're this teeny-weeny little band.

00:13:26.615 --> 00:13:29.382
Now, I know more about technology than most people,

00:13:29.382 --> 00:13:31.299
but that's just because I know more than most people

00:13:31.299 --> 00:13:36.467
who're 55, but people who're 18-20,
who live in this world,

00:13:36.467 --> 00:13:38.466
are going to be able to use these platforms in music

00:13:38.466 --> 00:13:42.869
and everywhere else in a fundamentally different way.

00:13:42.869 --> 00:13:44.686
I think creativity is coming back.

00:13:44.686 --> 00:13:46.635
Moonalice is something that's built around that.

00:13:46.635 --> 00:13:49.597
We have postal orders for every single show.

00:13:49.597 --> 00:13:51.634
We have photographers who work every show,

00:13:51.634 --> 00:13:54.747
we have painters and the notion is, I believe that

00:13:54.747 --> 00:13:59.068
creativity has been stifled not so much by technology,

00:13:59.068 --> 00:14:04.317
but by the general deterioration of American culture --

00:14:04.317 --> 00:14:06.065
you know, people's unwillingness to be educated,

00:14:06.065 --> 00:14:08.191
this notion that we have to fall back

00:14:08.191 --> 00:14:13.164
on ritual and beliefs, instead of facts.

00:14:13.164 --> 00:14:16.999
But I think technology's finally going to do us a favor.

00:14:16.999 --> 00:14:21.431
I think it's finally going to give us
the tools to make us independent.

00:14:21.431 --> 00:14:25.047
And there's little glimmers, we see the Arab Spring,

00:14:25.047 --> 00:14:28.166
and the impact that Twitter and Facebook had.

00:14:28.166 --> 00:14:32.880
Pretty exciting. But imagine a world

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.034
in which everything is an App.

00:14:37.034 --> 00:14:39.619
In HTML 5, digital Detroit gets replaced

00:14:39.619 --> 00:14:43.518
by this thing where every tweet is an app,

00:14:43.518 --> 00:14:47.303
every advertisement is an instance of a store.

00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:49.244
Think about what that means!

00:14:49.244 --> 00:14:52.141
So instead of seeing Amazon display ad, you see the store,

00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:55.439
say on the New York Times book review.

00:14:55.439 --> 00:14:59.928
You can both create demand
and satisfy it in the same place.

00:14:59.928 --> 00:15:02.866
Why? Because that's better for everybody.

00:15:02.866 --> 00:15:05.688
Saves time, increases engagement

00:15:05.688 --> 00:15:08.404
because it keeps you on the page.

00:15:08.404 --> 00:15:11.182
We're going from a web of elevators,

00:15:11.182 --> 00:15:13.662
where you go to different places and you go off-sites

00:15:13.662 --> 00:15:17.547
and you lose people, to a control panel model.

00:15:17.547 --> 00:15:20.216
And guess who's going to make it!

00:15:20.216 --> 00:15:21.735
You are!

00:15:21.735 --> 00:15:23.247
Thank you very much!

00:15:23.247 --> 00:15:25.584
(Applause)
