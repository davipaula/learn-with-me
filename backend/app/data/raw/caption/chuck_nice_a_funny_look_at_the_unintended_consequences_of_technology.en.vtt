00:00:12.863 --> 00:00:17.068
Future tech always comes
with two things: promise

00:00:17.092 --> 00:00:19.196
and unintended consequences.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.626
And it's those consequences
that I want to explore.

00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:26.824
And before we get to how
future tech may affect us,

00:00:26.848 --> 00:00:30.597
I'd like to spend a little time
exploring the unintended consequences

00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:32.188
of some of our recent tech,

00:00:32.212 --> 00:00:34.234
namely, social media.

00:00:34.885 --> 00:00:39.517
Social media, a few short years ago,
was the tech of future you.

00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:41.631
Now it just is you.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.952
Social media was supposed
to bring us together

00:00:44.976 --> 00:00:47.419
in ways we could never imagine.

00:00:47.443 --> 00:00:49.212
And the predictors were correct.

00:00:50.412 --> 00:00:53.254
These three girls
are talking to one another

00:00:53.278 --> 00:00:56.312
without the awkward discomfort
of eye contact.

00:00:56.336 --> 00:00:57.665
(Laughter)

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:59.769
I call that advancement.

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:05.041
We were supposed to be caught up
in a communication tsunami,

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:07.905
the likes of which the world
has never seen.

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:09.674
And that did happen.

00:01:09.698 --> 00:01:11.479
And so did this.

00:01:13.153 --> 00:01:16.197
(Sings) One of these things
is not like the other.

00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:17.918
(Speaks) Now, look at this picture.

00:01:17.942 --> 00:01:20.406
If you picked the guy
with the book, youâ€™re wrong --

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.194
or, as a certain president
would say, "Wrong!"

00:01:23.218 --> 00:01:25.140
(Laughter)

00:01:27.496 --> 00:01:29.783
Clearly, three of these guys are reading,

00:01:29.807 --> 00:01:32.187
and one guy, on the end,
is listening to music

00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:33.710
and playing "Candy Crush."

00:01:33.734 --> 00:01:35.285
(Laughter)

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:37.445
So are we more connected,

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:41.114
or are we just more connected
to our devices?

00:01:42.156 --> 00:01:45.561
Social media was supposed
to place us in a veritable town square,

00:01:45.585 --> 00:01:50.324
where we could engage one another
with challenging ideas and debates.

00:01:50.348 --> 00:01:53.238
And instead what we got were trolls.

00:01:53.262 --> 00:01:56.839
This is an actual tweet that I received.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.374
"Chuck, no one wants to hear
your stupid, ill-informed political views!

00:02:02.398 --> 00:02:04.719
I hope you get leprosy and die.

00:02:04.743 --> 00:02:06.151
Love, Dad"

00:02:06.175 --> 00:02:07.842
(Laughter)

00:02:08.796 --> 00:02:11.449
Now, the great thing
about that tweet if you look at it,

00:02:11.473 --> 00:02:13.460
just like most trolls, it's not that bad,

00:02:13.484 --> 00:02:17.154
because he wished "leporsy" on me
instead of "leprosy,"

00:02:17.178 --> 00:02:20.019
and "leporsy" is not dangerous at all.

00:02:20.043 --> 00:02:21.624
(Laughter)

00:02:21.648 --> 00:02:23.308
(Applause)

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:30.850
Along with trolls, we got
a brand new way of torturing teenagers --

00:02:30.874 --> 00:02:32.239
cyberbullying.

00:02:32.848 --> 00:02:37.781
A concept that my 75-year-old mother
just can't seem to wrap her head around.

00:02:38.441 --> 00:02:40.543
"So, uh, did they hit him?"

00:02:40.567 --> 00:02:42.249
"No, Mom, they didn't hit him."

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:43.935
"Did they take his money?"

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.825
"No, Mom, they didn't take his money."

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.705
"Did they put his face in the toilet?"

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:48.948
"No, Mom, they didn't --"

00:02:48.972 --> 00:02:50.183
"Well, what did they do?"

00:02:50.207 --> 00:02:52.086
"They attacked him on the internet."

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.321
"Attacked him on the internet?"

00:02:54.345 --> 00:02:55.346
(Laughter)

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.712
"Well, why don't you just
turn off the internet?"

00:02:57.736 --> 00:02:59.025
(Laughter)

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.591
"Your whole generation
is a bunch of wussies."

00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:03.120
(Laughter)

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.810
She's got a point.

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:06.173
(Laughter)

00:03:06.197 --> 00:03:07.356
She's got a point.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.998
And I don't even want to talk about
what social media has done to dating.

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:16.392
I was on Grindr until I found out
it wasn't a sandwich app.

00:03:16.416 --> 00:03:18.499
(Laughter)

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:23.130
And I can't even tell you about Tinder,

00:03:23.154 --> 00:03:27.054
except for the fact that
if you think there is a limit

00:03:27.078 --> 00:03:30.964
to the amount of anonymous sex
we can have on this planet,

00:03:30.988 --> 00:03:32.805
you are sadly mistaken.

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:33.830
(Laughter)

00:03:33.854 --> 00:03:35.733
So where do we go from here?

00:03:35.757 --> 00:03:38.124
Well, let's just jump right in
and play the hits.

00:03:38.148 --> 00:03:39.299
Driverless cars.

00:03:39.323 --> 00:03:41.995
Something that has already
been around for many years,

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.180
just without the assistance of computers.

00:03:44.204 --> 00:03:46.258
(Laughter)

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:49.711
(Applause)

00:03:50.733 --> 00:03:54.713
Because for years, we have
been driving while texting,

00:03:54.737 --> 00:03:56.315
putting on makeup,

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:59.421
shaving, reading -- actually reading --

00:03:59.445 --> 00:04:00.607
that would be me.

00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:01.644
(Laughter)

00:04:01.668 --> 00:04:04.667
The other thing is that since
driverless cars will be shared,

00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:06.007
most people won't own cars,

00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:08.349
and that means the DMV will go away.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.260
The DMV -- I know what
you're saying right now.

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:13.651
"There's no way this guy
is going to stand up here

00:04:13.675 --> 00:04:15.100
and make a case for the DMV."

00:04:15.124 --> 00:04:18.297
Well, I don't know about you,
but I do not want to live in a world

00:04:18.321 --> 00:04:20.599
where harsh fluorescent lights,

00:04:20.623 --> 00:04:22.521
endless lines,

00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:24.381
terrible forms to fill out

00:04:24.405 --> 00:04:28.380
and disaffected, soulless
bureaucrats remind me

00:04:28.404 --> 00:04:31.846
that I am pretty damn lucky
not to work here.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.020
(Laughter)

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.740
That is the real service they provide.

00:04:36.458 --> 00:04:37.975
The DMV:

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:40.060
come for the registration renewal,

00:04:40.084 --> 00:04:44.335
stay for the satisfaction of knowing
you made some pretty good life choices.

00:04:44.359 --> 00:04:46.206
(Laughter)

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.058
Nobody will own their car in the future,

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:54.128
and that means teenagers
will not have a place to make out.

00:04:55.546 --> 00:04:56.919
So you know what that means.

00:04:56.943 --> 00:05:00.173
That means they will order
driverless cars to do just that.

00:05:00.602 --> 00:05:04.967
I do not want to step into a vehicle
and ask the question:

00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:09.784
"Why does this car smell like
awkwardness, failure and shame?"

00:05:09.808 --> 00:05:11.966
(Laughter)

00:05:12.916 --> 00:05:15.960
If I want to ask that question,
I'll walk into my own bedroom.

00:05:15.984 --> 00:05:17.365
(Laughter)

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.399
So what else do we have
to look forward to?

00:05:19.423 --> 00:05:21.247
That's right, artificial intelligence.

00:05:21.271 --> 00:05:23.562
Artificial intelligence, yes.

00:05:23.586 --> 00:05:26.775
You know, there was a time
when artificial intelligence was a joke.

00:05:26.799 --> 00:05:30.431
I mean, literally a quip
that you would hear at a cocktail party

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:32.816
when somebody would
bring it up in conversation:

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.772
"Artificial intelligence.

00:05:34.796 --> 00:05:38.352
The only real artificial intelligence
is our American Congress.

00:05:38.376 --> 00:05:40.404
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."

00:05:40.428 --> 00:05:41.845
Well, it's not funny anymore.

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:43.908
(Laughter)

00:05:48.108 --> 00:05:51.659
Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk
and Bill Gates have all gone on record

00:05:51.683 --> 00:05:55.639
expressing grave reservations
about artificial intelligence.

00:05:55.663 --> 00:05:59.194
That's like Jesus, Moses and Muhammad
coming together and saying,

00:05:59.218 --> 00:06:02.008
"Guy, guys -- here's something
we can all believe in."

00:06:02.032 --> 00:06:03.054
(Laughter)

00:06:03.078 --> 00:06:05.491
You might want to go with that,
is all I'm saying.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.777
We are actually teaching
machines how to think,

00:06:11.801 --> 00:06:14.025
how to understand our behavior,

00:06:14.049 --> 00:06:17.650
how to defend themselves
and even practice deception.

00:06:18.904 --> 00:06:20.633
What could possibly go wrong?

00:06:20.657 --> 00:06:22.248
(Laughter)

00:06:23.568 --> 00:06:25.396
The one thing that's for sure:

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.569
the creation always despises its creator.

00:06:29.043 --> 00:06:30.236
OK?

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.385
The Titans rose up against the gods;

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:34.141
Lucifer against Jehovah.

00:06:34.547 --> 00:06:37.329
And anybody who has a teenager
has heard these words:

00:06:37.353 --> 00:06:39.386
"I hate you and you're ruining my life!

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.560
I hate you!"

00:06:42.325 --> 00:06:46.880
Now just imagine that sentiment
with a machine that can outthink you

00:06:46.904 --> 00:06:48.747
and is heavily armed.

00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:50.282
(Laughter)

00:06:51.074 --> 00:06:52.275
The result?

00:06:52.976 --> 00:06:54.178
Absolutely.

00:06:54.202 --> 00:06:55.658
(Laughter)

00:06:58.973 --> 00:07:02.217
What we need to do before we perfect
artificial intelligence

00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:04.428
is perfect artificial emotions.

00:07:04.793 --> 00:07:08.703
That way, we can teach
the robots or machines

00:07:08.727 --> 00:07:11.208
how to love us unconditionally,

00:07:11.232 --> 00:07:15.757
so that when they figure out
that the only real problem on this planet

00:07:15.781 --> 00:07:16.971
is us,

00:07:16.995 --> 00:07:18.711
instead of destroying us --

00:07:18.735 --> 00:07:21.839
which, by the way, is totally logical --

00:07:21.863 --> 00:07:24.309
they will find us adorable --

00:07:24.333 --> 00:07:25.399
(Laughter)

00:07:25.423 --> 00:07:26.644
like baby poop.

00:07:26.668 --> 00:07:27.671
(Laughter)

00:07:27.695 --> 00:07:30.801
"Oh my god, I just love the way
you just destroyed the planet.

00:07:30.825 --> 00:07:33.597
I can't stay mad at you, you're so cute!

00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:34.843
You're so cute!"

00:07:34.867 --> 00:07:36.027
(Laughter)

00:07:36.051 --> 00:07:42.976
Can't talk about this without
talking about robotics. OK?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.121
Remember when you thought
robotics were cool?

00:07:45.145 --> 00:07:47.267
I remember when I thought
robotics were cool,

00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:50.451
until I figured out that they were
going to take everybody's place,

00:07:50.475 --> 00:07:52.741
from the delivery guy
down to the heart surgeon.

00:07:52.765 --> 00:07:55.794
The one thing, though,
that is very disappointing about robotics

00:07:55.818 --> 00:07:57.250
is the holy grail of robotics,

00:07:57.274 --> 00:07:58.621
and it hasn't even happened.

00:07:58.645 --> 00:08:00.584
I'm talking about the robot girlfriend,

00:08:00.608 --> 00:08:04.216
the dream of one lonely geek
in a windowless basement

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.665
who vowed one day:
"I am going to marry my creation."

00:08:08.738 --> 00:08:13.765
And there actually is a movement underway
to stop this from happening,

00:08:13.789 --> 00:08:15.953
for fear of exploitation.

00:08:16.653 --> 00:08:19.279
And I, for one, am against that movement.

00:08:20.224 --> 00:08:23.051
I believe we should
have robot girlfriends.

00:08:23.596 --> 00:08:27.841
I just believe that they should come
with a feminist protocol

00:08:27.865 --> 00:08:29.744
and artificial intelligence,

00:08:29.768 --> 00:08:33.973
so she can take one look at that guy
and go, "I am too good for you.

00:08:33.997 --> 00:08:35.299
I'm leaving."

00:08:35.323 --> 00:08:36.888
(Laughter)

00:08:36.912 --> 00:08:38.948
(Applause)

00:08:40.371 --> 00:08:42.002
And finally,

00:08:42.026 --> 00:08:44.208
I have to talk about bioengineering,

00:08:44.714 --> 00:08:50.767
an area of science that promises
to end disease before it even begins,

00:08:51.658 --> 00:08:56.078
to help us live longer,
fuller, healthier lives.

00:08:57.218 --> 00:09:00.340
And when you couple that
with implantable hardware,

00:09:00.364 --> 00:09:04.791
you are looking at the next incarnation
of human evolution.

00:09:04.815 --> 00:09:07.131
And all of that sounds great,

00:09:07.155 --> 00:09:09.456
until you figure out
where it's really going.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.659
One place:

00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:12.452
designer babies,

00:09:13.317 --> 00:09:15.344
where, no matter
where you are on the globe

00:09:15.368 --> 00:09:17.153
or what your ethnicity,

00:09:17.177 --> 00:09:19.811
babies will end up looking like that.

00:09:19.835 --> 00:09:21.431
(Laughter)

00:09:21.455 --> 00:09:24.037
That boy is surprised

00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:27.540
because he just found out
both his parents are black.

00:09:27.564 --> 00:09:30.272
(Laughter)

00:09:35.569 --> 00:09:38.737
Can you imagine him
at a cocktail party in 20 years?

00:09:39.429 --> 00:09:41.042
"Yeah, both my parents are black.

00:09:41.066 --> 00:09:43.265
I mean, it's a little awkward at times,

00:09:43.289 --> 00:09:45.036
but you should see my credit rating.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.783
Impressive, very impressive."

00:09:46.807 --> 00:09:48.246
(Laughter)

00:09:49.353 --> 00:09:51.693
Now, all of this seems scary,

00:09:51.717 --> 00:09:54.364
and everybody in this room
knows that it isn't.

00:09:54.388 --> 00:09:55.850
Technology isn't scary.

00:09:56.568 --> 00:09:59.483
Never has been and it never will be.

00:10:00.113 --> 00:10:02.784
What's scary is us

00:10:02.808 --> 00:10:04.800
and what we will do with technology.

00:10:05.332 --> 00:10:08.421
Will we allow it to expose our humanity,

00:10:09.334 --> 00:10:11.641
showing our true selves

00:10:11.665 --> 00:10:15.509
and reinforcing the fact
that we are indeed our brother's keeper?

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:21.974
Or will we allow it to reveal
our deepest, darkest demons?

00:10:22.723 --> 00:10:27.880
The true question is not
whether or not technology is scary.

00:10:28.326 --> 00:10:29.611
The true question is:

00:10:30.273 --> 00:10:31.425
How human

00:10:31.874 --> 00:10:33.044
are you?

00:10:33.656 --> 00:10:34.807
Thank you.

00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:38.761
(Applause)
