00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:14.381
Like so many of you,

00:00:14.405 --> 00:00:16.698
when I'm hungry, I open the fridge

00:00:16.722 --> 00:00:19.650
and get myself something to eat
any time I want.

00:00:20.309 --> 00:00:23.545
This is something most of us
who live in a developed country

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:25.249
don't think much about.

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:30.323
However, it is a luxury that I didn't
think I would ever have in my life

00:00:30.347 --> 00:00:33.585
when I lived in a refugee camp
in Tanzania 23 years ago,

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:35.014
or even seven years ago,

00:00:35.038 --> 00:00:37.387
when I was living
in my home country of Rwanda

00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:39.339
before I moved to the USA.

00:00:39.784 --> 00:00:41.696
I was only seven years old

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.704
when my home country of Rwanda
went through the tragedy of the genocide

00:00:45.728 --> 00:00:47.061
that took so many lives,

00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:50.307
and they made us flee the country,
and we became refugees.

00:00:50.736 --> 00:00:53.600
Life in a refugee camp -- it wasn't life.

00:00:55.452 --> 00:00:56.892
It was survival.

00:00:57.572 --> 00:01:02.278
I saw a lot of people dying
from disease, poor sanitation,

00:01:02.302 --> 00:01:03.706
hunger.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.589
Food became a rare commodity.

00:01:06.353 --> 00:01:07.514
There were bad days.

00:01:07.538 --> 00:01:11.855
My family and I would survive
on the leaves and grasses from the forest.

00:01:12.287 --> 00:01:14.760
There were also worse times,

00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:20.188
when we would go two or three days
without anything to eat at all,

00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:22.656
only drinking water from the swamp.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.728
After three years in a refugee camp,

00:01:24.752 --> 00:01:27.283
we decided to return back to Rwanda.

00:01:27.307 --> 00:01:30.204
And our struggle with food continued.

00:01:30.228 --> 00:01:35.077
However, farming proved to be
the only reliable source of food.

00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:38.538
But our food lacked
the nutritional diversity,

00:01:38.562 --> 00:01:40.918
and we continued to depend
on food assistance

00:01:40.942 --> 00:01:44.157
from the United Nations World Food Program

00:01:44.181 --> 00:01:45.763
to balance our diet.

00:01:45.787 --> 00:01:50.196
Still today, more than
70 percent of Rwandans,

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.331
they work in the agriculture sector.

00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:55.913
But malnutrition and stunting
remain rampant.

00:01:56.244 --> 00:01:59.228
I came to realize that
food insecurity and malnutrition

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:02.234
were not happening because people
were not farming enough;

00:02:03.544 --> 00:02:06.408
it was because people
were not farming the right crops.

00:02:07.315 --> 00:02:09.275
I eventually left Rwanda

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.656
and moved to the USA for graduate school

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.299
and discovered the possible
solution to that problem.

00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:18.521
And that solution is quinoa.

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:24.323
Quinoa is indigenous
to the Indian regions of South America,

00:02:24.347 --> 00:02:27.037
in countries like Bolivia, Peru ...

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:31.077
And it's very well-known
for its powerhouse nutrient,

00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:34.046
and the crop has all the nine
essential amino acids,

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.252
making it a complete protein.

00:02:36.276 --> 00:02:39.937
But unfortunately,
quinoa is not cultivated as much

00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:41.815
in different parts of the world.

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:43.760
In Rwanda, for example,

00:02:43.784 --> 00:02:47.006
beans are the only thing
that kept so many of us alive

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.450
during those times
of hunger and starvation.

00:02:51.117 --> 00:02:52.458
As a matter of fact,

00:02:52.482 --> 00:02:54.974
Rwanda is the number one
beans-consuming country

00:02:54.998 --> 00:02:56.678
in the world per capita.

00:02:57.077 --> 00:02:58.847
In this part of Africa,

00:02:58.871 --> 00:03:04.216
beans are one of the only crops
that provide immediate food source,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.566
because you can eat beans
at every stage of growth.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.185
We eat beans, leaves
and green beans before harvest.

00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:14.109
Unfortunately, you cannot cultivate beans

00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:16.585
in the same field season after season.

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.244
You need to ensure
there is regular rotation

00:03:19.268 --> 00:03:21.809
to avoid disease and pests.

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:27.579
Like beans, farmers can enjoy
the nutritious quinoa leaves.

00:03:27.603 --> 00:03:30.642
While beans are considered nutritious,

00:03:30.666 --> 00:03:32.663
quinoa has far more micronutrients,

00:03:32.687 --> 00:03:36.597
and with quinoa, you can make many [more]
different food products and drinks

00:03:36.621 --> 00:03:38.029
than beans.

00:03:38.053 --> 00:03:39.363
In 2015,

00:03:39.387 --> 00:03:43.577
alongside my research team
at Washington State University,

00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:46.275
we introduced quinoa in Rwanda
for the first time.

00:03:46.657 --> 00:03:49.349
We tested 20 varieties of quinoa

00:03:49.373 --> 00:03:53.392
to see the adaptability
in three ecological zones of Rwanda.

00:03:54.252 --> 00:03:56.513
And the results were astonishing.

00:03:56.537 --> 00:03:58.609
Among the 20 varieties we tested,

00:03:58.633 --> 00:04:03.013
15 of them showed the potential
to grow well in Rwanda's climate.

00:04:03.538 --> 00:04:07.425
And later, we started
Quinoa Model Farmers Program.

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.852
We gave those potential
varieties to farmers

00:04:09.876 --> 00:04:12.410
to grow in their farm and community.

00:04:12.434 --> 00:04:13.863
We started with 12 farmers,

00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:15.434
and three years later,

00:04:15.458 --> 00:04:18.402
we are now working with
around 500 farmers,

00:04:18.426 --> 00:04:19.760
including my mother,

00:04:19.784 --> 00:04:22.833
who is locally known
as "the queen of quinoa"

00:04:22.857 --> 00:04:27.382
because of her work in helping
other farmers adopt this crop.

00:04:27.793 --> 00:04:29.531
We give them seeds,

00:04:29.555 --> 00:04:32.093
train them how to grow it
and how to cook it.

00:04:32.117 --> 00:04:33.855
And farmers are pretty creative,

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:36.279
coming up with recipes of their own.

00:04:36.593 --> 00:04:39.879
And we've started seeing
remarkable changes in their lives,

00:04:39.903 --> 00:04:41.229
including success stories

00:04:41.253 --> 00:04:46.665
that many of them can now have access
to nutritious food three times a day.

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:48.654
I'd like to note that quinoa

00:04:48.678 --> 00:04:52.427
is not meant to entirely
[push out] other crops.

00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:55.410
We introduced quinoa as a supplement

00:04:55.434 --> 00:04:57.981
to create overall health and nutrition,

00:04:58.005 --> 00:05:01.903
rounding out diet
to combat chronic malnutrition.

00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:04.771
We have started this model
with quinoa in Rwanda,

00:05:04.795 --> 00:05:08.368
but it can be replicated
in different countries

00:05:08.392 --> 00:05:10.485
experiencing hunger and malnutrition.

00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:16.856
About one in nine people in the world
suffer from chronic malnutrition.

00:05:17.187 --> 00:05:19.127
We have started research collaboration

00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:23.469
with institutions in countries like
Kenya, Malawi, Uganda

00:05:23.493 --> 00:05:27.035
and other countries
experiencing hunger and malnutrition.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.188
And quinoa isn't the only magic crop.

00:05:30.212 --> 00:05:33.496
There are several crops
with high adaptability

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.303
and nutritional value,

00:05:36.631 --> 00:05:42.385
crops like millet, sorghum,
fonio, barley, oat, to name a few.

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:46.641
These crops have high adaptability
and respond well to climate change.

00:05:46.665 --> 00:05:50.823
You can grow these magic crops
in different parts of the world,

00:05:50.847 --> 00:05:56.061
bridging the gap, so that there is
accessible nutritious food for everyone.

00:05:57.283 --> 00:05:59.172
I know how it feels to be hungry.

00:05:59.196 --> 00:06:00.476
I've been there.

00:06:01.037 --> 00:06:03.608
And I know how it feels
to be malnourished,

00:06:03.632 --> 00:06:05.736
because I've been there, too.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.586
Introducing crops with high biodiversity,
adaptability and nutritional value

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.527
will play an important role
in creating food security,

00:06:15.551 --> 00:06:19.113
seed sovereignty
and sustainable production

00:06:19.137 --> 00:06:24.318
in communities and countries that are
experiencing hunger and malnutrition.

00:06:24.924 --> 00:06:28.390
Having nutritious food
should not be a luxury.

00:06:28.916 --> 00:06:33.655
There is a need to ensure that there is
accessible and affordable nutritious food

00:06:33.679 --> 00:06:35.063
for everyone.

00:06:35.087 --> 00:06:38.423
And this is a step towards
making it a reality.

00:06:39.873 --> 00:06:41.023
Thank you.
