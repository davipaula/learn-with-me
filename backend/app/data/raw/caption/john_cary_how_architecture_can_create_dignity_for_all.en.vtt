00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.456
On a beautiful day, just a few years ago

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.896
my wife and I entered a hospital

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.696
near our home in Oakland, California

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.960
for the birth of our first daughter, Maya.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.256
We had responsibly toured
the birthing center in advance

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.216
and yet we were somehow
still startled to find ourselves

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.096
in the place where we would experience

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.640
one of the most significant
moments of our lives.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.776
We were stuck in a windowless room

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.200
with no hint of the bright
and sunny day that we had left.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.400
Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.840
the paint on the walls was beige

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.416
and machines beeped inexplicably

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.440
as a wall clock indicated
day turning to night.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.496
That clock was placed above a door

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.496
in direct line of sight

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.280
to where my wife lay as her contractions
increased hour after hour.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.136
Now, I've never given birth --

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.176
(Laughter)

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.096
but she assured me that the last thing
that a birthing woman would ever want

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.896
is to watch the seconds tick by.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.760
(Laughter)

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.096
An architect by training,
I've always been fascinated

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.136
watching people experience design
in the world around them.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.656
I believe design functions
like the soundtrack

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.840
that we're not even
fully aware is playing.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.016
It sends us subconscious messages
about how to feel

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.400
and what to expect.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.816
That room that we were in
seemed completely misaligned

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.776
with the moment
that we were experiencing --

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.696
welcoming a human being,

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.000
our daughter, into this world.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.496
At one point a nurse, without any prompt,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.176
turned to us and said,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.896
"I always think to myself,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.776
'I wish I had become an architect,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.776
because I could have designed
rooms like this better.'"

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.016
I said to her,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.416
"An architect did design this room."

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.176
(Laughter)

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.856
Despite the immense joy
of our daughter's birth,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.000
the messages of that hospital room
stick with she and I to this day.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.816
Those messages are,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.336
"You are not at home,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.176
you are in a foreign place."

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.015
"You are not in control of anything.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.280
Not even the lighting."

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.640
"Your comfort, simply, is secondary."

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.936
At best,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.176
a hospital room like this

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.680
might just be described
or dismissed as uninspiring.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.000
At worst, it is undignifying.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.016
And I use it to point out that none of us,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.616
anywhere in the world,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.320
are immune from bad design.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.136
I went into architecture
because I believed

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.320
it was about creating spaces for people
to live their best lives.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.616
And yet what I found
is a profession largely disconnected

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.640
from the people most directly
impacted by its work.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.736
I believe this is because
architecture remains

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.080
a white, male, elitist profession --

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.416
seemingly unconcerned

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.216
with some of the greatest
needs in the world

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.520
or even the relatively simple needs
of an expectant mother.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.096
Students are trained in school

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.416
using highly theoretical projects,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.136
rarely interacting with real people
or actual communities.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.976
Graduates are funneled
through a long, narrow

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.296
unforgiving path to licensure.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.176
Meanwhile, the profession
holds up a select few

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.176
through relentless award programs

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.136
focused almost exclusively
on the aesthetics of buildings,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.360
rather than the societal impact
or contributions of them.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.016
It only goes to reinforce a warped view

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.176
of professional responsibility and success

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.976
and yet this isn't
why so many young, hopeful people

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.240
go into architecture.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.536
It's not why I did.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.016
I believed then, though I didn't
have a language for it,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.000
and I know now, that design
has a unique ability to dignify.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.816
It can make people feel valued,

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.096
respected,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.760
honored and seen.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.960
Now I'd like for you to just think
about some of the spaces that you inhabit.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.040
And I'd like to have you think
about how they make you feel.

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:32.656
Now, there are places
that make us feel unhappy,

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.256
unhealthy

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.520
or uninspiring.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.056
They may be the places that you work

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.280
or where you heal

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.280
or even where you live.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.760
And I ask, how might these places
be better designed with you in mind?

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.736
It's a really simple question

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.600
and it can somehow, sometimes
be very difficult to answer.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.296
Because we are conditioned
to feel like we don't have much agency

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.416
over the spaces and places
that we live, work and play.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.280
And in many cases we don't.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.160
But we all should.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.160
Now, here's a potentially dumb question
for any women watching:

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.216
Have you ever stood

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.936
in a disproportionately long
bathroom line?

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.456
(Laughter)

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.896
Did you ever think to yourself,
"What is wrong with this picture?"

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.896
Well, what if the real question is,

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.376
"What is wrong with the men
that designed these bathrooms?"

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.296
(Applause)

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.936
It may seem like a small thing,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.680
but it's representative
of a much more serious issue.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.976
The contemporary world
was literally built by men

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.096
who have rarely
taken the time to understand

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.416
how people unlike them

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.736
experience their designs.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.816
A long bathroom line
might seem like a minor indignity.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.816
But the opposite can also be true.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.536
Thoughtful design
can make people feel respected

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.760
and seen.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.896
I've come to believe
that dignity is to design

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.096
what justice is to law

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.960
and health is to medicine.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.096
In the simplest of terms,

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.600
it's about having the spaces you inhabit
reflect back your value.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.176
Over the past two years

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.816
I had the opportunity to interview
over 100 people from all walks of life

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.176
about their experience of design.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.416
I wanted to test my hunch

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.280
that dignity and design
are uniquely related.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.736
I listened to Gregory,

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.976
a resident of this cottage community

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.816
designed specifically

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.696
for the 50 most chronically
homeless people in Dallas.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.456
Gregory had been living on the streets,

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.360
drifting from town to town
for over 30 years.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.480
A broad coalition

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.176
of social service agencies,

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.616
funders and designers,

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.720
created this place.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.336
Each 400 square foot cottage
is designed beautifully

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.560
as a permanent home.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.016
Gregory now has a key

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.496
to a door

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.936
to his own house.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.216
He describes the sense
of security that it brings him.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.216
Something he had lived without
for three decades.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.696
When he arrived with little more
than the clothes on his back,

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.176
he found everything:

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.776
from a toaster, Crock-Pot and stove

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.200
to a toothbrush and toothpaste
awaiting for him.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.880
He describes it simply

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.040
as heaven.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.320
On the other side of the world,

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.016
I listened to Antoinette,

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.856
the director of this
training and community center

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.296
for women in rural Rwanda.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.816
Hundreds of women
come to this place daily --

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.616
to learn new skills,

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.016
be in community,

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.896
and continue rebuilding their lives

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.640
following the country's civil war.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.056
These women literally pressed

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.136
the 500,000 bricks

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.000
that make up the 17
classroom pavilions like this one.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.376
Antoinette told me,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.080
"Everyone is so proud of it."

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.376
And then back here in the US

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.056
I listened to Monika,

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.376
the director of a free clinic

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.880
primarily serving
the uninsured in Arkansas.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.096
Monika loves telling me that the doctors,

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.656
who volunteer at her free clinic

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.976
routinely tell her

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.280
that they've never worked
in such a beautiful, light-filled place.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.936
Monika believes

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.016
that even people experiencing poverty

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.536
deserve quality health care.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.856
And what's more,

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.296
she believes they deserve
to receive that care

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.840
in a dignified setting.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.416
People like these are invaluable
ambassadors for design

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:52.280
and yet they are roundly absent
from architectural discourse.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.256
Similarly, the people who can
most benefit from good design

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.600
often have the least access to it.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.496
Your cousin, a homeless veteran;

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.096
your grandma or grandpa

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.616
who live in a house with a kitchen
that's no longer accessible to them;

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.336
your wheelchair-bound sister

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.160
in a suburban area
planned without sidewalks.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.816
If good design
is only for a privileged few,

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.160
what good is it?

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.776
It's time designers change this

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.936
by dedicating their practices
to the public good

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.696
in the model of firms

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.416
like Orkidstudio,

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.856
Studio Gang

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.736
and MASS Design Group.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.136
Their clients

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.736
are orphaned children in Kenya,

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.256
foster children in Chicago

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.200
and pregnant women in Malawi.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.496
Their practices are premised on the belief

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:51.360
that everyone deserves good design.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.656
Dedicating more practices
to the public good

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.616
will not only create
more design that is dignifying,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:02.160
but it will also
dignify the practice of design.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.016
It will not only diversify
the client base of design,

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.496
but it will also create new,
more diverse forms of design

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.720
for the world.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.976
Now, in order to do this,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.776
my architecture and design friends,
especially my fellow white guys,

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.976
we must simultaneously
and significantly diversify our ranks.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.216
If we want the public to believe
that design is for them

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.616
and for everyone.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.496
Today, barely 15 percent

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.176
of registered architects
in the United States are women.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.320
And a far smaller percentage
are persons of color.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.856
Other professions, like law and medicine

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.080
had made far greater strides
in these crucial areas.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.896
How might our shared built environment --

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.776
our homes, our hospitals,
our schools, our public spaces --

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.056
be shaped differently

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.456
if women and people of color

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.136
were behind half
of the proverbial blueprints?

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.256
It is not a question of whether,

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.976
but to what extent

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.456
our buildings, our landscapes,

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.016
our cities and our rural communities

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.176
are less beautiful, less functional,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.856
less equitable and less dignifying

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:16.080
because women and people of color
are less likely to be creating them.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.056
As Winston Churchill
famously noted in 1943

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.696
when he called for the rebuilding

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.416
of London's war-damaged
parliamentary chambers,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:29.200
"We shape our buildings,
and afterward, they shape us."

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.936
The good news is
that we can change how we build

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.656
and who we build for.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.736
Be that a health worker in rural Rwanda,

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.600
or a birthing mother and nervous
new father in the United States.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.616
We can do this
by recommitting architecture

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:49.360
to the health, safety
and welfare of the public.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.856
This will pay dividends.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.736
Because once you see what design can do,

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.040
you can't unsee it.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.056
And once you experience dignity,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.656
you can't accept anything less.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.800
Both become part of your possible.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.656
One of my favorite conversation partners
is my 90-year-old grandmother,

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.576
Audrey Gorwitz, from Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.256
After one of our
conversations about design,

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.576
she wrote me a letter.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.280
She said, "Dear Johnny,

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.016
I thought the other day,
as I sat in my doctor's office,

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.296
how depressing it was,

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.936
from the color on the wall,
to the carpet on the floor.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.096
(Laughter)

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.896
Now I will have to call to see

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.576
who is responsible
for the drabness in that place."

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.736
(Laughter)

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.656
In the same letter, mind you, she said,

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.856
"I did call, and I got the man in charge,

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.496
and he said he appreciated
someone calling him.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.896
My doctor's office
is now on the list for an upgrade."

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.416
(Laughter)

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.976
She signed it by saying,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.056
"It is always good
to express one's opinion

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.456
if done in a proper manner."

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.736
(Laughter)

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.056
(Applause)

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.456
I love my grandma.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.976
(Laughter)

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.776
Like my grandma Audrey,

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.256
you deserve good design.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.016
Because well-designed spaces

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.536
are not just a matter of taste
or a questions of aesthetics.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.056
They literally shape our ideas
about who we are in the world

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.480
and what we deserve.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.496
That is the essence of dignity.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.616
And both the opportunity
and the responsibility of design

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.856
for good

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.120
and for all.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.776
Thank you.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:31.600
(Applause)
