00:00:10.104 --> 00:00:11.176
Okay, thank you very much!

00:00:11.176 --> 00:00:13.295
I'm Hannah Fry, the badass,

00:00:13.295 --> 00:00:15.019
and today I'm asking the question:

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:16.896
Is life really that complex?

00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:19.925
Now, I've only got 9 minutes
to provide you with an answer.

00:00:19.925 --> 00:00:22.972
So, what I've done
is split this neatly into two parts:

00:00:22.972 --> 00:00:25.159
Part one - Yes,

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.993
and later on, part two -
No, or, to be more accurate:

00:00:30.052 --> 00:00:34.485
No? Okay, so first of all let me try
and define what I mean by complex.

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:36.950
Now I could give you
a host of formal definitions,

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.646
but, in the simplest terms,
any problem and complexity

00:00:39.646 --> 00:00:43.150
is something that Einstein
and his peers can't do.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.803
So, let's imagine -
if the clicker works, there we go.

00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:49.293
Einstein is playing the game of snooker.

00:00:49.293 --> 00:00:52.481
He's a clever chap, so he knows
that when he hits the cue ball

00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:54.247
he could write you an equation

00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:57.440
and tell you exactly where the red ball
is going to hit the sides,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.902
how fast it's going
and where it's going to end up.

00:00:59.902 --> 00:01:03.345
Now, if you scale these snooker balls
up to the size of the solar system,

00:01:03.345 --> 00:01:06.051
Einstein can still help you,
sure, the physics changes,

00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:08.638
but, if you wanted to know
about the path of the Earth

00:01:08.638 --> 00:01:11.113
around the Sun,
Einstein could write you an equation

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:14.179
telling you exactly where
both objects are at any point in time.

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:16.350
Now, with a surprising increase
in difficulty

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.878
Einstein could include
the Moon in his calculations,

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:22.040
but, as you add more and more planets,
Mars and Jupiter, say,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.446
the problem gets too tough for Einstein
to solve with a pen and paper.

00:01:25.446 --> 00:01:28.272
Now, strangely if instead of having
a handful of planets

00:01:28.272 --> 00:01:29.861
you had millions of objects,

00:01:29.861 --> 00:01:33.038
even billions, the problem
actually becomes much simpler

00:01:33.038 --> 00:01:35.067
and Einstein is back in the game.

00:01:35.752 --> 00:01:37.556
Let me explain what I mean by this,

00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:41.049
by scaling these objects back down
to a molecular level.

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.546
If you wanted to trace the erratic path
of an individual air molecule

00:01:44.546 --> 00:01:46.511
you'd have absolutely no hope,

00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:49.246
but when you have millions
of air molecules all together

00:01:49.246 --> 00:01:51.990
they start to act in a way
which is quantifiable

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.576
predictable and well behaved, and,
thank Goodness, air is well behaved

00:01:55.576 --> 00:01:58.694
because if it wasn't,
planes would fall out of the sky.

00:01:58.694 --> 00:02:01.853
Now, on an even bigger scale,
across the whole of the world,

00:02:01.853 --> 00:02:04.757
the idea is exactly the same
with all of these air molecules.

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:08.121
It's true that you can't take
an individual rain droplet

00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:10.825
and say where it's come from,
where it's going to end up

00:02:10.825 --> 00:02:14.843
but you can say with pretty good certainty
whether it's going to be cloudy tomorrow.

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:18.649
So, that's it. In Einstein's time
this is how far science had got.

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:21.279
We could do really small problems
with a few objects,

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:25.215
with simple interactions,
or you could do huge problems

00:02:25.215 --> 00:02:27.452
with milions of objects
and simple interactions.

00:02:27.452 --> 00:02:29.506
But what about everything in the middle?

00:02:29.506 --> 00:02:32.466
Well, just seven years
before Einstein's death

00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:35.736
an American scientist called
Warren Weaver made exactly this point.

00:02:35.736 --> 00:02:37.755
He said that scientific methodology

00:02:37.755 --> 00:02:39.512
has gone from one extreme to another

00:02:39.512 --> 00:02:42.100
leaving out an untouched
great middle region.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.503
Now, this middle region 
is where complexity science lies

00:02:45.503 --> 00:02:47.664
and this is what I mean by complex.

00:02:47.664 --> 00:02:51.195
Now, unfortunately, almost every
single problem you can think of

00:02:51.195 --> 00:02:54.182
to do with human behavior
lies in this middle region.

00:02:54.182 --> 00:02:58.644
Einstein's got absolutely no idea
how to model the movement of a crowd,

00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:01.484
there are too many people
to look at them all individually

00:03:01.484 --> 00:03:03.614
and too few to treat them as a gas.

00:03:03.614 --> 00:03:06.627
Similarly, people are prone
to annoying things

00:03:06.627 --> 00:03:09.226
like decisions of not wanting
to walk into each other

00:03:09.226 --> 00:03:11.681
which makes the problem
all the more complicated.

00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:13.231
Einstein also couldn't tell you

00:03:13.231 --> 00:03:15.603
when the next stock market crash
is going to be,

00:03:15.603 --> 00:03:18.348
Einstein couldn't tell you
how to improve unemployment,

00:03:18.348 --> 00:03:19.695
Einstein can't even tell you

00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:23.831
whether the next iPhone
is going to be a hit or a flop.

00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:26.298
So, to conclude part one,
we're completely screwed,

00:03:26.298 --> 00:03:30.740
we've got no tools to deal with this
and life is way too complex.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.561
But, maybe there's hope,
because in the last few years

00:03:33.561 --> 00:03:37.407
we've begun to see the beginnings
of a new area of science

00:03:37.407 --> 00:03:40.778
using mathematics
to model our social systems

00:03:40.778 --> 00:03:44.217
and I'm not just talking here
about statistics and computer simulations,

00:03:44.217 --> 00:03:47.368
I'm talking about writing down equations
about our society

00:03:47.368 --> 00:03:49.544
that will help us understand
what is going on

00:03:49.544 --> 00:03:52.819
in the same ways with the snooker balls
or the weather prediction.

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.745
And this has come about
because people have begun to realize

00:03:55.745 --> 00:03:57.977
that we can use and exploit analogies

00:03:57.977 --> 00:03:59.710
between our human systems

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.364
and those of the physical world around us.

00:04:02.364 --> 00:04:05.537
Now, to give you an example
of the incredibly complex problem

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:07.684
of migration across Europe.

00:04:07.684 --> 00:04:10.994
Actually, as it turns out, when you view
all of the people together,

00:04:10.994 --> 00:04:12.684
collectively they behave as though

00:04:12.684 --> 00:04:14.609
they're following the laws of gravity.

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.150
But instead of planets
being attracted to one another,

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.716
it's people who are attracted
to areas with better job opportunities,

00:04:21.716 --> 00:04:25.861
higher pay, better quality of life
and lower unemployment.

00:04:25.861 --> 00:04:30.084
And in the same way as people
are more likely to go for opportunities

00:04:30.084 --> 00:04:33.048
close to where they live already,
London to Kent, for example,

00:04:33.048 --> 00:04:34.819
as opposed to London to Melbourne,

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.841
the gravitational effect of planets

00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:38.572
faraway is felt much less.

00:04:39.335 --> 00:04:42.949
So, to give you another example,
in 2008 a group in UCLA

00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:47.375
were looking into the patterns
of burglary hot spots in the city.

00:04:48.973 --> 00:04:53.402
Now, one thing about burglaries
is this idea of repeat victimization.

00:04:54.083 --> 00:04:57.609
So, if you have a group of burglars
who manage to successfully rob an area,

00:04:57.609 --> 00:05:01.722
what they'll do is they'll tend to return
to that area and carry on burgling it,

00:05:01.722 --> 00:05:06.624
so they learn the layout of the houses,
the escape routes

00:05:06.624 --> 00:05:09.136
and the local security measures
that are in place,

00:05:09.136 --> 00:05:11.431
and this will continue to happen

00:05:11.431 --> 00:05:14.912
until local residents and police
ramp up the security

00:05:14.912 --> 00:05:17.428
at which point the burglars
will move off elsewhere.

00:05:17.428 --> 00:05:20.106
And it's that balance
between burglars and security

00:05:20.106 --> 00:05:22.760
which create these dynamic
hot spots of the city.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.656
As it turns out,
this is exactly the same process

00:05:26.656 --> 00:05:29.241
as how a leopard gets its spots,

00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:32.186
except in the leopard example
it's not burglars and security,

00:05:32.186 --> 00:05:33.512
it's the chemical process

00:05:33.512 --> 00:05:36.842
that creates these patterns
and something called morphogenesis.

00:05:37.481 --> 00:05:41.264
We actually know an awful lot
about the morphogenesis of leopard spots.

00:05:41.264 --> 00:05:46.264
Maybe we can use this to try and spot
some of the warning signs with burglaries

00:05:46.264 --> 00:05:50.360
and perhaps, also to create
better crime strategies to prevent crime

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.546
and there's a group here
at UCL who are working

00:05:53.546 --> 00:05:56.532
with the West Midlands police right now
on this very question.

00:05:56.532 --> 00:06:00.043
I could give you plenty of examples
like this

00:06:00.043 --> 00:06:02.678
but I wanted to leave you
with one from my own research

00:06:02.678 --> 00:06:03.703
on the London riots.

00:06:03.703 --> 00:06:05.793
Now, you probably
don't need me to tell you

00:06:05.793 --> 00:06:07.360
about the events of last summer

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.503
where London and UK saw
the worst sustained period of violent

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:12.915
looting and arson for over twenty years.

00:06:12.915 --> 00:06:15.848
It's understandable
that as a society we want

00:06:15.848 --> 00:06:17.898
to try and understand exactly what caused

00:06:17.898 --> 00:06:20.929
these riots but, also,
perhaps to equip our police

00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:25.906
with better strategies to lead
to a swifter resolution in the future.

00:06:25.906 --> 00:06:28.616
Now, I don't want to upset
the sociologists here,

00:06:28.616 --> 00:06:31.134
so I absolutely cannot talk about

00:06:31.134 --> 00:06:33.234
the individual motivations for a rioter

00:06:33.234 --> 00:06:36.314
but when you look at the rioters
all together,

00:06:36.314 --> 00:06:39.304
mathematically you can separate it
into a three stage process

00:06:39.304 --> 00:06:41.384
and draw analogies accordingly.

00:06:41.384 --> 00:06:44.071
So, step one. Let's say
you've got a group of friends,

00:06:44.071 --> 00:06:46.387
none of them are involved in the riots.

00:06:46.387 --> 00:06:49.387
But one of them walks past
a Foot Locker which is being raided

00:06:49.877 --> 00:06:52.682
and goes in and bags himself
a new pair of trainers.

00:06:52.682 --> 00:06:55.280
Now, he texts one of his friends
and says, you know,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.760
"Come on down to the riots."

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.045
So his friend joins him,

00:06:58.045 --> 00:07:00.506
and then the two of them
text more of their friends

00:07:00.506 --> 00:07:02.929
who join them
and text more of their friends

00:07:02.929 --> 00:07:05.546
and more and more and so it continues.

00:07:05.546 --> 00:07:09.278
This process is identical to the way
that a virus spreads through a population.

00:07:09.278 --> 00:07:12.305
If you think about the bird flu epidemic
a couple of years ago,

00:07:12.305 --> 00:07:14.024
the more people that were infected,

00:07:14.024 --> 00:07:17.538
the more people that got infected
and the faster the virus spread

00:07:17.538 --> 00:07:21.435
before the authorities managed
to get a handle on events.

00:07:21.435 --> 00:07:24.074
And it's exactly the same process here.

00:07:24.074 --> 00:07:26.113
So, okay, let's say you've got a rioter,

00:07:26.113 --> 00:07:27.740
he's decided he's going to riot,

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.992
the next thing he has to do
is pick a riot site.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.638
What you should know about rioters

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:40.246
is that they're not really prepared
to travel that far

00:07:40.246 --> 00:07:42.945
from where they live
unless is a really juicy riot site.

00:07:42.945 --> 00:07:44.327
(Laughter)

00:07:44.327 --> 00:07:46.459
So you can see that here, from this graph

00:07:46.459 --> 00:07:49.694
that an awful lot of rioters
having traveled less than a kilometer

00:07:49.694 --> 00:07:51.276
to the site that they went to.

00:07:51.276 --> 00:07:55.507
Now, this pattern is seen
in consumer models of retail spending,

00:07:55.507 --> 00:07:58.358
i.e. where we choose to go shopping.

00:07:58.358 --> 00:08:00.865
So, of course,
people like to go to local shops

00:08:00.865 --> 00:08:03.921
but you'd be prepared
to go a little bit further

00:08:03.921 --> 00:08:05.956
if it was a really good retail site.

00:08:05.956 --> 00:08:09.284
And this anology actually was already
picked up by some of the papers,

00:08:09.284 --> 00:08:10.425
with some tabloid press

00:08:10.425 --> 00:08:12.498
calling the events
"Shopping with violence"

00:08:12.498 --> 00:08:15.996
which probably sums it up
in terms of our research.

00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:17.854
Oh, I'm going backwards.

00:08:20.336 --> 00:08:23.569
Okay, step three.
Finally, the rioter is at his site

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:27.558
and now he wants to avoid
getting caught by the police.

00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:30.637
The rioters will avoid
the police at all times

00:08:30.637 --> 00:08:33.947
but there is some safety in numbers,
and on the flip side

00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:35.939
the police with their limited resources,

00:08:35.939 --> 00:08:38.657
are trying to protect
as much of the city as possible,

00:08:38.657 --> 00:08:42.247
arrest rioters wherever possible
and to create a deterrent effect.

00:08:46.349 --> 00:08:50.365
Actually, as it turns out,
this mechanism between the two species,

00:08:50.365 --> 00:08:52.511
so to speak, of of rioters and the police

00:08:52.511 --> 00:08:54.747
is identical to predators
and prey in the wild;

00:08:54.747 --> 00:08:56.695
so if you can imagine rabbits and foxes,

00:08:56.695 --> 00:08:59.825
rabbits are trying to avoid
foxes at all costs,

00:08:59.825 --> 00:09:01.895
while foxes are patrolling the space

00:09:01.895 --> 00:09:03.559
trying to look for rabbits.

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:06.991
We actually know an awful lot
about the dynamics of predators and prey,

00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:11.119
we also know a lot about
the consumer spending flows

00:09:11.119 --> 00:09:12.841
and we know a lot about

00:09:12.841 --> 00:09:15.399
how viruses spread through a population.

00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:18.368
So, if you take these three analogies
together and exploit them

00:09:18.368 --> 00:09:20.486
you can come up with a mathematical model

00:09:20.486 --> 00:09:21.858
of what actually happened,

00:09:21.858 --> 00:09:24.291
that's capable of replicating
the general patterns

00:09:24.291 --> 00:09:26.237
of the riots themselves.

00:09:26.237 --> 00:09:29.121
Once we've got this,
we can almost use this as a petri dish

00:09:29.121 --> 00:09:32.483
to start having conversations
about which areas of the city

00:09:32.483 --> 00:09:34.304
were more susceptible than others

00:09:34.304 --> 00:09:36.184
and what police tactics could be used

00:09:36.184 --> 00:09:38.433
if this were ever to happen again
in future.

00:09:38.433 --> 00:09:40.648
Even twenty years ago
modelling of this sort

00:09:40.648 --> 00:09:43.494
was completely unheard of,
but I think that these analogies

00:09:44.067 --> 00:09:46.572
are an incredibly important tool

00:09:46.572 --> 00:09:49.741
in tackling problems with our society
and perhaps,

00:09:49.741 --> 00:09:52.558
ultimately improving our society overall.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.934
So, to conclude: life is complex,

00:09:54.934 --> 00:09:58.571
but perhaps understanding it need not
necessarily be that complicated.

00:09:58.571 --> 00:09:59.605
Thank you.

00:09:59.605 --> 00:10:01.412
