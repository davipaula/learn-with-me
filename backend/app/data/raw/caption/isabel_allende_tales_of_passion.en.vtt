00:00:13.985 --> 00:00:15.608
Thank you so much.

00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:19.002
It's really scary to be here
among the smartest of the smart.

00:00:19.026 --> 00:00:20.028
(Laughter)

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:22.940
I'm here to tell you
a few tales of passion.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.436
There's a Jewish saying that I love:

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.852
What is truer than truth?

00:00:29.706 --> 00:00:31.796
Answer: the story.

00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:34.507
I'm a storyteller.

00:00:34.888 --> 00:00:38.223
I want to convey something
that is truer than truth

00:00:38.247 --> 00:00:40.093
about our common humanity.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.485
All stories interest me,

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:45.923
and some haunt me
until I end up writing them.

00:00:46.271 --> 00:00:48.509
Certain themes keep coming up:

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:54.611
justice, loyalty, violence,
death, political and social issues,

00:00:54.635 --> 00:00:55.785
freedom.

00:00:56.486 --> 00:00:59.199
I'm aware of the mystery around us,

00:00:59.223 --> 00:01:02.072
so I write about
coincidences, premonitions,

00:01:02.096 --> 00:01:06.780
emotions, dreams,
the power of nature, magic.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.429
In the last 20 years,
I have published a few books,

00:01:11.453 --> 00:01:16.199
but I have lived in anonymity
until February of 2006,

00:01:16.223 --> 00:01:20.457
when I carried the Olympic flag
in the Winter Olympics in Italy.

00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:22.979
That made me a celebrity.

00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:24.005
(Laughter)

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:25.993
Now people recognize me in Macy's,

00:01:26.017 --> 00:01:28.241
and my grandchildren think that I'm cool.

00:01:28.265 --> 00:01:29.273
(Laughter)

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:32.365
Allow me to tell you about
my four minutes of fame.

00:01:33.047 --> 00:01:35.786
One of the organizers
of the Olympic ceremony,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.419
of the opening ceremony,

00:01:37.443 --> 00:01:41.217
called me and said that I had been
selected to be one of the flag bearers.

00:01:42.303 --> 00:01:45.698
I replied that surely,
this was a case of mistaken identity,

00:01:45.722 --> 00:01:48.862
because I'm as far as you can get
from being an athlete.

00:01:48.886 --> 00:01:51.918
Actually, I wasn't even sure
that I could go around the stadium

00:01:51.942 --> 00:01:53.144
without a walker.

00:01:53.168 --> 00:01:54.231
(Laughter)

00:01:54.255 --> 00:01:56.754
I was told that this was
no laughing matter.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.939
This would be the first time

00:01:58.963 --> 00:02:02.096
that only women
would carry the Olympic flag.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.739
Five women, representing five continents,

00:02:04.763 --> 00:02:07.944
and three Olympic gold medal winners.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.530
My first question was, naturally:

00:02:10.554 --> 00:02:12.097
What was I going to wear?

00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:13.215
(Laughter)

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.397
"A uniform," she said,

00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:17.342
and asked for my measurements.

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:18.999
My measurements.

00:02:19.023 --> 00:02:21.491
I had a vision of myself
in a fluffy anorak,

00:02:21.515 --> 00:02:23.666
looking like the Michelin Man.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.015
(Laughter)

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:28.227
By the middle of February,
I found myself in Turin,

00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:30.462
where enthusiastic crowds cheered

00:02:30.486 --> 00:02:34.553
when any of the 80 Olympic
teams was in the street.

00:02:34.577 --> 00:02:39.373
Those athletes had sacrificed everything
to compete in the games.

00:02:39.397 --> 00:02:42.987
They all deserved to win,
but there's the element of luck.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.722
A speck of snow, an inch of ice,
the force of the wind

00:02:47.746 --> 00:02:50.855
can determine the result
of a race or a game.

00:02:51.315 --> 00:02:57.155
However, what matters most,
more than training or luck, is the heart.

00:02:57.766 --> 00:03:02.075
Only a fearless and determined heart
will get the gold medal.

00:03:02.612 --> 00:03:04.202
It is all about passion.

00:03:04.694 --> 00:03:08.707
The streets of Turin
were covered with red posters

00:03:08.731 --> 00:03:11.380
announcing the slogan of the Olympics:

00:03:11.404 --> 00:03:13.706
"Passion lives here."

00:03:15.147 --> 00:03:16.970
Isn't it always true?

00:03:16.994 --> 00:03:21.040
Heart is what drives us
and determines our fate.

00:03:21.064 --> 00:03:24.136
That is what I need
for my characters in my books:

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.721
a passionate heart.

00:03:26.491 --> 00:03:31.842
I need mavericks, dissidents,
adventurers, outsiders and rebels,

00:03:31.866 --> 00:03:35.715
who ask questions,
bend the rules and take risks.

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.485
People like all of you in this room.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.544
Nice people with common sense
do not make interesting characters.

00:03:43.568 --> 00:03:44.572
(Laughter)

00:03:44.596 --> 00:03:46.951
They only make good former spouses.

00:03:46.975 --> 00:03:48.136
(Laughter)

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.288
(Applause)

00:03:51.312 --> 00:03:54.994
In the greenroom of the stadium,
I met the other flag bearers:

00:03:55.018 --> 00:03:59.642
three athletes and the actresses
Susan Sarandon and Sophia Loren.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.748
Also, two women with passionate hearts:

00:04:02.772 --> 00:04:06.962
Wangari Maathai,
the Nobel Prize winner from Kenya

00:04:06.986 --> 00:04:08.920
who has planted 30 million trees,

00:04:08.944 --> 00:04:14.694
and by doing so, she has changed the soil,
the weather, in some places in Africa,

00:04:14.718 --> 00:04:18.411
and of course, the economic
conditions in many villages;

00:04:18.435 --> 00:04:20.040
and Somaly Mam,

00:04:20.064 --> 00:04:25.715
a Cambodian activist who fights
passionately against child prostitution.

00:04:25.739 --> 00:04:29.739
When she was 14 years old,
her grandfather sold her to a brothel.

00:04:30.484 --> 00:04:33.827
She told us of little girls raped by men

00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:36.576
who believe that having sex
with a very young virgin

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.173
will cure them from AIDS,

00:04:39.197 --> 00:04:44.684
and of brothels where children are forced
to receive 15 clients per day,

00:04:44.708 --> 00:04:47.964
and if they rebel,
they are tortured with electricity.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.140
In the greenroom, I received my uniform.

00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:55.310
It was not the kind of outfit
that I normally wear,

00:04:55.334 --> 00:04:59.230
but it was far from the Michelin Man suit
that I had anticipated.

00:04:59.254 --> 00:05:00.686
Not bad, really.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.250
I looked like a refrigerator.

00:05:02.274 --> 00:05:03.290
(Laughter)

00:05:03.314 --> 00:05:07.325
But so did most of the flag bearers,
except Sophia Loren,

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.534
the universal symbol
of beauty and passion.

00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:14.734
Sophia is over 70 and she looks great.

00:05:14.758 --> 00:05:18.794
She's sexy, slim and tall,
with a deep tan.

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:22.660
Now, how can you have a deep tan
and have no wrinkles?

00:05:22.684 --> 00:05:24.065
I don't know.

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:28.223
When asked in a TV interview
how could she look so good,

00:05:28.247 --> 00:05:30.361
she replied, "Posture."

00:05:30.385 --> 00:05:31.393
(Laughter)

00:05:31.417 --> 00:05:33.136
"My back is always straight,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.096
and I don't make old people's noises."

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.136
(Laughter)

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.048
So there you have some free advice

00:05:40.072 --> 00:05:42.829
from one of the most beautiful
women on earth:

00:05:42.853 --> 00:05:45.548
no grunting, no coughing, no wheezing,

00:05:45.572 --> 00:05:48.045
no talking to yourselves, no farting.

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:49.079
(Laughter)

00:05:49.103 --> 00:05:50.791
Well, she didn't say that, exactly.

00:05:50.815 --> 00:05:52.639
(Laughter)

00:05:52.663 --> 00:05:54.603
At some point around midnight,

00:05:54.627 --> 00:05:56.914
we were summoned
to the wings of the stadium,

00:05:56.938 --> 00:05:59.274
and the loudspeakers announced
the Olympic flag,

00:05:59.298 --> 00:06:00.820
and the music started --

00:06:00.844 --> 00:06:04.088
by the way, the same music
that starts here, the "Aida" march.

00:06:04.935 --> 00:06:07.799
Sophia Loren was right in front of me.

00:06:07.823 --> 00:06:11.533
She's a foot taller than I am,
not counting the poofy hair.

00:06:11.557 --> 00:06:12.576
(Laughter)

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.438
She walked elegantly,
like a giraffe on the African savanna,

00:06:17.462 --> 00:06:20.323
holding the flag on her shoulder.

00:06:20.347 --> 00:06:21.732
I jogged behind --

00:06:21.756 --> 00:06:22.770
(Laughter)

00:06:22.794 --> 00:06:27.262
on my tiptoes, holding the flag
on my extended arm,

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:30.861
so that my head was actually
under the damn flag.

00:06:30.885 --> 00:06:32.755
(Laughter)

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:35.404
All the cameras were,
of course, on Sophia.

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:37.125
That was fortunate for me,

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:40.278
because in most press photos,
I appear too --

00:06:40.302 --> 00:06:42.675
although, often between Sophia's legs --

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:44.944
(Laughter)

00:06:44.968 --> 00:06:47.520
a place where most men would love to be.

00:06:47.544 --> 00:06:49.067
(Laughter)

00:06:49.091 --> 00:06:51.899
(Applause)

00:06:51.923 --> 00:06:57.049
The best four minutes of my entire life
were those in the Olympic stadium.

00:06:57.073 --> 00:06:59.953
My husband is offended when I say this,

00:06:59.977 --> 00:07:02.778
although I have explained
to him that what we do in private

00:07:02.802 --> 00:07:04.713
usually takes less than four minutes --

00:07:04.737 --> 00:07:05.914
(Laughter)

00:07:05.938 --> 00:07:07.819
so he shouldn't take it personally.

00:07:07.843 --> 00:07:08.843
(Laughter)

00:07:08.867 --> 00:07:12.620
I have all the press clippings
of those four magnificent minutes

00:07:12.644 --> 00:07:14.723
because I don't want to forget them

00:07:14.747 --> 00:07:17.905
when old age destroys my brain cells.

00:07:17.929 --> 00:07:22.421
I want to carry in my heart forever
the key word of the Olympics:

00:07:22.445 --> 00:07:23.620
passion.

00:07:24.088 --> 00:07:25.856
So here's a tale of passion.

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:28.782
The year is 1998,

00:07:28.806 --> 00:07:32.951
the place is a prison camp
for Tutsi refugees in Congo.

00:07:32.975 --> 00:07:38.505
By the way, 80 percent of all refugees
and displaced people in the world

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:39.870
are women and girls.

00:07:41.131 --> 00:07:43.708
We can call this place
in Congo a death camp,

00:07:43.732 --> 00:07:48.226
because those who are not killed
will die of disease or starvation.

00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:54.015
The protagonists of this story
are a young woman, Rose Mapendo,

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:55.261
and her children.

00:07:55.785 --> 00:07:58.100
She's pregnant and a widow.

00:07:58.124 --> 00:08:02.459
Soldiers had forced her to watch
as her husband was tortured and killed.

00:08:02.998 --> 00:08:06.282
Somehow she manages
to keep her seven children alive,

00:08:06.306 --> 00:08:10.398
and a few months later,
she gives birth to premature twins,

00:08:10.422 --> 00:08:12.367
two tiny little boys.

00:08:12.764 --> 00:08:15.492
She cuts the umbilical cord with a stick

00:08:15.516 --> 00:08:17.657
and ties it with her own hair.

00:08:18.522 --> 00:08:21.760
She names the twins
after the camp's commanders

00:08:21.784 --> 00:08:23.386
to gain their favor,

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.644
and feeds them with black tea
because her milk cannot sustain them.

00:08:28.358 --> 00:08:32.142
When the soldiers burst in her cell
to rape her oldest daughter,

00:08:32.166 --> 00:08:35.009
she grabs hold of her
and refuses to let go,

00:08:35.033 --> 00:08:37.407
even when they hold a gun to her head.

00:08:38.288 --> 00:08:42.190
Somehow, the family
survives for 16 months,

00:08:42.214 --> 00:08:44.888
and then, by extraordinary luck

00:08:44.912 --> 00:08:50.081
and the passionate heart
of a young American man, Sasha Chanoff,

00:08:50.105 --> 00:08:55.524
who manages to put her
in a US rescue plane,

00:08:55.548 --> 00:09:00.556
Rose Mapendo and her nine children
end up in Phoenix, Arizona,

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.175
where they're now living and thriving.

00:09:04.216 --> 00:09:08.956
"Mapendo," in Swahili, means "great love."

00:09:11.306 --> 00:09:14.222
The protagonists of my books
are strong and passionate women

00:09:14.246 --> 00:09:15.755
like Rose Mapendo.

00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:17.531
I don't make them up;

00:09:17.555 --> 00:09:19.090
there's no need for that.

00:09:19.114 --> 00:09:21.295
I look around, and I see them everywhere.

00:09:21.319 --> 00:09:24.286
I have worked with women
and for women all my life.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:25.460
I know them well.

00:09:26.398 --> 00:09:30.413
I was born in ancient times,
at the end of the world,

00:09:30.437 --> 00:09:34.727
in a patriarchal Catholic
and conservative family.

00:09:34.751 --> 00:09:38.421
No wonder that by age five,
I was a raging feminist --

00:09:38.445 --> 00:09:41.225
although the term
had not reached Chile yet,

00:09:41.249 --> 00:09:43.728
so nobody knew what the heck
was wrong with me.

00:09:43.752 --> 00:09:45.779
(Laughter)

00:09:45.803 --> 00:09:49.769
I would soon find out that there was
a high price to pay for my freedom

00:09:49.793 --> 00:09:51.794
and for questioning the patriarchy.

00:09:51.818 --> 00:09:53.411
But I was happy to pay it,

00:09:53.435 --> 00:09:55.667
because for every blow that I received,

00:09:55.691 --> 00:09:57.500
I was able to deliver two.

00:09:57.524 --> 00:09:58.674
(Laughter)

00:09:59.103 --> 00:10:02.062
Once, when my daughter Paula
was in her twenties,

00:10:02.086 --> 00:10:05.840
she said to me that feminism was dated,
that I should move on.

00:10:06.475 --> 00:10:08.326
We had a memorable fight.

00:10:08.803 --> 00:10:10.707
Feminism is dated?

00:10:10.731 --> 00:10:15.388
Yes, for privileged women
like my daughter and all of us here today,

00:10:15.412 --> 00:10:19.088
but not for most of our sisters
in the rest of the world,

00:10:19.112 --> 00:10:21.869
who are still forced
into premature marriage,

00:10:21.893 --> 00:10:24.768
prostitution, forced labor.

00:10:24.792 --> 00:10:28.314
They have children that they don't want
or they cannot feed.

00:10:28.798 --> 00:10:32.056
They have no control
over their bodies or their lives.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.663
They have no education and no freedom.

00:10:34.687 --> 00:10:38.770
They are raped, beaten up
and sometimes killed with impunity.

00:10:39.556 --> 00:10:41.889
For most Western young women of today,

00:10:41.913 --> 00:10:44.666
being called a "feminist" is an insult.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.542
Feminism has never been sexy,

00:10:46.566 --> 00:10:50.132
but let me assure you
that it never stopped me from flirting,

00:10:50.156 --> 00:10:53.020
and I have seldom
suffered from lack of men.

00:10:53.044 --> 00:10:54.842
(Laughter)

00:10:54.866 --> 00:10:57.074
Feminism is not dead, by no means.

00:10:57.098 --> 00:10:58.505
It has evolved.

00:10:58.875 --> 00:11:00.224
If you don't like the term,

00:11:00.248 --> 00:11:01.926
change it, for Goddess' sake.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:06.635
Call it "Aphrodite" or "Venus"
or "bimbo" or whatever you want.

00:11:06.659 --> 00:11:07.953
The name doesn't matter,

00:11:07.977 --> 00:11:11.245
as long as we understand
what it is about, and we support it.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.488
So here's another tale of passion,
and this is a sad one.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.707
The place is a small women's clinic
in a village in Bangladesh.

00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:23.032
The year is 2005.

00:11:23.056 --> 00:11:26.372
Jenny is a young American dental hygienist

00:11:26.396 --> 00:11:31.072
who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer
during her three-week vacation.

00:11:31.096 --> 00:11:33.609
She's prepared to clean teeth,

00:11:33.633 --> 00:11:34.817
but when she gets there,

00:11:34.841 --> 00:11:37.829
she finds out that there are
no doctors, no dentists,

00:11:37.853 --> 00:11:40.875
and the clinic
is just a hut full of flies.

00:11:41.319 --> 00:11:43.298
Outside, there is a line of women

00:11:43.322 --> 00:11:46.489
who have waited several
hours to be treated.

00:11:46.902 --> 00:11:50.057
The first patient is in excruciating pain

00:11:50.081 --> 00:11:52.453
because she has several rotten molars.

00:11:52.945 --> 00:11:57.072
Jenny realizes that the only solution
is to pull out the bad teeth.

00:11:57.096 --> 00:12:00.048
She's not licensed for that;
she has never done it.

00:12:00.072 --> 00:12:02.933
She risks a lot and she's terrified.

00:12:02.957 --> 00:12:05.570
She doesn't even have
the proper instruments,

00:12:05.594 --> 00:12:08.978
but fortunately, she has brought
some novocaine.

00:12:09.961 --> 00:12:13.527
Jenny has a brave and passionate heart.

00:12:13.551 --> 00:12:17.261
She murmurs a prayer
and she goes ahead with the operation.

00:12:17.723 --> 00:12:21.351
At the end, the relieved
patient kisses her hands.

00:12:21.802 --> 00:12:25.014
That day the hygienist
pulls out many more teeth.

00:12:25.959 --> 00:12:29.659
The next morning, when she comes
again to the so-called clinic,

00:12:29.683 --> 00:12:33.179
her first patient is waiting
for her with her husband.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.683
The woman's face looks like a watermelon.

00:12:36.707 --> 00:12:40.088
It is so swollen
that you can't even see the eyes.

00:12:40.112 --> 00:12:43.382
The husband, furious,
threatens to kill the American.

00:12:43.985 --> 00:12:47.406
Jenny is horrified at what she has done.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:50.429
But then, the translator explains

00:12:50.453 --> 00:12:54.003
that the patient's condition
has nothing to do with the operation.

00:12:54.614 --> 00:12:57.504
The day before, her husband beat her up

00:12:57.528 --> 00:13:01.630
because she was not home in time
to prepare dinner for him.

00:13:03.007 --> 00:13:05.771
Millions of women live like this today.

00:13:05.795 --> 00:13:07.795
They are the poorest of the poor.

00:13:08.487 --> 00:13:11.604
Although women do
two-thirds of the world's labor,

00:13:11.628 --> 00:13:15.204
they own less than one percent
of the world's assets.

00:13:15.228 --> 00:13:20.420
They are paid less than men
for the same work, if they're paid at all,

00:13:20.444 --> 00:13:24.585
and they remain vulnerable because
they have no economic independence,

00:13:24.609 --> 00:13:27.136
and they are constantly
threatened by exploitation,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.810
violence and abuse.

00:13:29.421 --> 00:13:32.607
It is a fact that giving
women education, work,

00:13:32.631 --> 00:13:36.837
the ability to control their own income,
inherit and own property

00:13:36.861 --> 00:13:38.755
benefits the society.

00:13:38.779 --> 00:13:40.136
If a woman is empowered,

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.311
her children and her family
will be better off.

00:13:43.335 --> 00:13:46.381
If families prosper, the village prospers,

00:13:46.405 --> 00:13:48.652
and eventually, so does the whole country.

00:13:49.096 --> 00:13:51.653
Wangari Maathai
goes to a village in Kenya.

00:13:51.677 --> 00:13:55.413
She talks with the women
and explains that the land is barren

00:13:55.437 --> 00:13:58.032
because they have cut and sold the trees.

00:13:58.056 --> 00:14:01.153
She gets the women to plant
new trees and water them,

00:14:01.177 --> 00:14:02.940
drop by drop.

00:14:02.964 --> 00:14:06.359
In a matter of five or six years,
they have a forest,

00:14:06.383 --> 00:14:09.530
the soil is enriched,
and the village is saved.

00:14:10.379 --> 00:14:12.961
The poorest and most backward societies

00:14:12.985 --> 00:14:15.701
are always those that put women down.

00:14:16.088 --> 00:14:19.231
Yet this obvious truth
is ignored by governments

00:14:19.255 --> 00:14:21.367
and also by philanthropy.

00:14:21.391 --> 00:14:24.662
For every dollar given
to a women's program,

00:14:24.686 --> 00:14:27.481
20 dollars are given to men's programs.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.136
Women are 51 percent of humankind.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.782
Empowering them will change everything,

00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:37.834
more than technology
and design and entertainment.

00:14:37.858 --> 00:14:41.704
I can promise you
that women working together --

00:14:41.728 --> 00:14:43.989
linked, informed and educated --

00:14:44.013 --> 00:14:48.037
can bring peace and prosperity
to this forsaken planet.

00:14:48.648 --> 00:14:52.405
In any war today,
most of the casualties are civilians,

00:14:52.429 --> 00:14:54.101
mainly women and children.

00:14:54.125 --> 00:14:56.111
They are collateral damage.

00:14:56.802 --> 00:14:58.320
Men run the world,

00:14:58.344 --> 00:15:00.262
and look at the mess we have.

00:15:00.286 --> 00:15:02.684
What kind of world do we want?

00:15:02.708 --> 00:15:07.010
This is a fundamental question
that most of us are asking.

00:15:07.034 --> 00:15:11.780
Does it make sense to participate
in the existing world order?

00:15:11.804 --> 00:15:14.453
We want a world where life is preserved

00:15:14.477 --> 00:15:17.310
and the quality of life
is enriched for everybody,

00:15:17.334 --> 00:15:19.282
not only for the privileged.

00:15:21.148 --> 00:15:25.106
In January, I saw an exhibit
of Fernando Botero's paintings

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.824
at the UC Berkeley library.

00:15:27.848 --> 00:15:30.645
No museum or gallery in the United States,

00:15:30.669 --> 00:15:34.545
except for the New York gallery
that carries Botero's work,

00:15:34.569 --> 00:15:36.511
has dared to show the paintings,

00:15:36.535 --> 00:15:40.035
because the theme
is the Abu Ghraib prison.

00:15:40.059 --> 00:15:43.992
They are huge paintings
of torture and abuse of power,

00:15:44.016 --> 00:15:46.802
in the voluminous Botero style.

00:15:46.826 --> 00:15:50.572
I have not been able to get
those images out of my mind

00:15:50.596 --> 00:15:51.746
or my heart.

00:15:52.866 --> 00:15:56.231
What I fear most is power with impunity.

00:15:56.255 --> 00:15:59.339
I fear abuse of power,
and the power to abuse.

00:15:59.363 --> 00:16:02.612
In our species,
the alpha males define reality,

00:16:02.636 --> 00:16:05.517
and force the rest of the pack
to accept that reality

00:16:05.541 --> 00:16:07.242
and follow the rules.

00:16:07.266 --> 00:16:10.953
The rules change all the time,
but they always benefit them,

00:16:10.977 --> 00:16:14.994
and in this case, the trickle-down effect,
which does not work in economics,

00:16:15.018 --> 00:16:16.509
works perfectly.

00:16:16.533 --> 00:16:19.871
Abuse trickles down from the top
of the ladder to the bottom.

00:16:20.374 --> 00:16:23.792
Women and children,
especially the poor, are at the bottom.

00:16:24.403 --> 00:16:27.857
Even the most destitute of men
have someone they can abuse --

00:16:27.881 --> 00:16:29.642
a woman or a child.

00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:34.421
I'm fed up with the power
that a few exert over the many

00:16:34.445 --> 00:16:37.319
through gender, income, race and class.

00:16:38.176 --> 00:16:41.294
I think that the time is ripe
to make fundamental changes

00:16:41.318 --> 00:16:42.914
in our civilization.

00:16:42.938 --> 00:16:45.485
But for real change,
we need feminine energy

00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:47.390
in the management of the world.

00:16:47.414 --> 00:16:50.787
We need a critical number of women
in positions of power,

00:16:50.811 --> 00:16:54.269
and we need to nurture
the feminine energy in men.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:57.646
I'm talking about men
with young minds, of course.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.767
Old guys are hopeless;
we have to wait for them to die off.

00:17:00.791 --> 00:17:03.906
(Laughter)

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.493
Yes, I would love to have
Sophia Loren's long legs

00:17:07.517 --> 00:17:09.763
and legendary breasts.

00:17:09.787 --> 00:17:13.060
But given a choice, I would rather
have the warrior hearts

00:17:13.084 --> 00:17:17.988
of Wangari Maathai, Somaly Mam,
Jenny, and Rose Mapendo.

00:17:18.012 --> 00:17:21.111
I want to make this world good.

00:17:21.135 --> 00:17:23.320
Not better -- but to make it good.

00:17:23.715 --> 00:17:26.213
Why not? It is possible.

00:17:26.237 --> 00:17:28.294
Look around in this room --

00:17:28.318 --> 00:17:32.604
all this knowledge, energy,
talent and technology.

00:17:33.469 --> 00:17:36.488
Let's get off our fannies,
roll up our sleeves

00:17:36.512 --> 00:17:39.111
and get to work, passionately,

00:17:39.135 --> 00:17:42.060
in creating an almost-perfect world.

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:43.718
Thank you.

00:17:43.742 --> 00:17:50.742
(Applause and cheers)
