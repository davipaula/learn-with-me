00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:17.665
In 2019, humanity received a warning:

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.401
30 of the world's leading scientists
released the results

00:00:20.425 --> 00:00:23.907
of a massive three-year study
into global agriculture

00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:27.572
and declared that meat production
is destroying our planet

00:00:27.596 --> 00:00:29.279
and jeopardizing global health.

00:00:29.804 --> 00:00:31.558
One of the study's authors explained

00:00:31.582 --> 00:00:35.126
that "humanity now poses a threat
to the stability of the planet ...

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.070
[This requires] nothing less than
a new global agricultural revolution."

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:43.076
As somebody who's spent
the last two decades

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.188
advocating a shift away
from industrial meat production,

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:50.140
I wanted to believe that this clarion call
was going to make a difference.

00:00:50.164 --> 00:00:55.264
The thing is, I've seen this sort of thing
again and again and again for decades.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.252
Here's 2018 from the journal "Nature,"

00:00:59.276 --> 00:01:02.351
2017 from "Bioscience Journal,"

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:05.753
2016 from the National
Academy of Sciences.

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:10.122
The main point of these studies
tends to be climate change.

00:01:10.146 --> 00:01:14.165
But antibiotic resistance
represents just as big of a threat.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.969
We are feeding massive doses
of antibiotics to farm animals.

00:01:18.382 --> 00:01:22.383
These antibiotics are then
mutating into superbugs

00:01:22.407 --> 00:01:25.426
that threaten to render
antibiotics obsolete

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.501
within all of our lifetimes.

00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:29.161
You want a scare?

00:01:29.185 --> 00:01:31.698
Google: "the end of working antibiotics."

00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:34.619
I'm going to get one thing out of the way:

00:01:34.643 --> 00:01:36.937
I am not here to tell anybody what to eat.

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.435
Individual action is great,

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:42.160
but antibiotic resistance
and climate change --

00:01:42.184 --> 00:01:43.650
they require more.

00:01:44.212 --> 00:01:48.445
Besides, convincing the world
to eat less meat hasn't worked.

00:01:48.918 --> 00:01:53.586
For 50 years, environmentalists,
global health experts and animal activists

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.671
have been begging the public
to eat less meat.

00:01:57.194 --> 00:01:59.250
And yet, per capita meat consumption

00:01:59.274 --> 00:02:02.678
is as high as it's been
in recorded history.

00:02:03.378 --> 00:02:07.187
The average North American last year
ate more than 200 pounds of meat.

00:02:07.724 --> 00:02:09.237
And I didn't eat any.

00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:10.491
(Laughter)

00:02:10.515 --> 00:02:13.575
Which means somebody out there
ate 400 pounds of meat.

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.686
(Laughter)

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.415
On our current trajectory,

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:22.127
we're going to need to be producing
70 to 100 percent more meat by 2050.

00:02:22.151 --> 00:02:24.618
This requires a global solution.

00:02:25.317 --> 00:02:29.270
What we need to do is we need to produce
the meat that people love,

00:02:29.294 --> 00:02:31.793
but we need to produce it
in a whole new way.

00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:34.323
I've got a couple of ideas.

00:02:34.347 --> 00:02:37.789
Idea number one:
let's grow meat from plants.

00:02:37.813 --> 00:02:40.262
Instead of growing plants,
feeding them to animals,

00:02:40.286 --> 00:02:41.720
and all of that inefficiency,

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:44.649
let's grow those plants,
let's biomimic meat with them,

00:02:44.673 --> 00:02:46.326
let's make plant-based meat.

00:02:46.968 --> 00:02:49.806
Idea number two: for actual animal meat,

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.978
let's grow it directly from cells.

00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:55.277
Instead of growing live animals,
let's grow the cells directly.

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:58.726
It takes six weeks to grow
a chicken to slaughter weight.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.274
Grow the cells directly,
you can get that same growth

00:03:01.298 --> 00:03:02.756
in six days.

00:03:03.693 --> 00:03:05.970
This is what that looks like at scale.

00:03:07.237 --> 00:03:09.917
It's your friendly
neighborhood meat brewery.

00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:12.836
(Laughter)

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.659
I want to make two points about this.

00:03:14.683 --> 00:03:16.805
The first one is, we believe we can do it.

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.807
In recent years, some companies
have been producing meat from plants

00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:24.878
that consumers cannot distinguish
from actual animal meat,

00:03:24.902 --> 00:03:28.653
and there are now dozens of companies
growing actual animal meat

00:03:28.677 --> 00:03:30.558
directly from cells.

00:03:30.582 --> 00:03:32.770
This plant-based and cell-based meat

00:03:32.794 --> 00:03:35.407
gives consumers everything
that they love about meat --

00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:37.440
the taste, the texture and so on --

00:03:37.464 --> 00:03:39.537
but with no need for antibiotics

00:03:39.561 --> 00:03:42.781
and with a fraction of the adverse
impact on the climate.

00:03:43.352 --> 00:03:46.505
And because these two technologies
are so much more efficient,

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:47.972
at production scale

00:03:47.996 --> 00:03:50.011
these products will be cheaper.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.704
But one quick point about that --

00:03:52.728 --> 00:03:54.579
it's not going to be easy.

00:03:54.603 --> 00:03:58.506
These plant-based companies have spent
small fortunes on their burgers,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.145
and cell-based meat has not yet
been commercialized at all.

00:04:02.685 --> 00:04:04.816
So we're going to need all hands on deck

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.282
to make these the global meat industry.

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:10.688
For starters, we need
the present meat industry.

00:04:11.156 --> 00:04:13.362
We don't want to disrupt
the meat industry,

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:15.388
we want to transform it.

00:04:15.412 --> 00:04:17.115
We need their economies of scale,

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.323
their global supply chain,
their marketing expertise

00:04:20.347 --> 00:04:22.209
and their massive consumer base.

00:04:22.962 --> 00:04:24.782
We also need governments.

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:28.350
Governments spend tens of billions
of dollars every single year

00:04:28.374 --> 00:04:30.010
on research and development

00:04:30.034 --> 00:04:32.539
focused on global health
and the environment.

00:04:33.007 --> 00:04:36.919
They should be putting some of that money
into optimizing and perfecting

00:04:36.943 --> 00:04:40.625
the production of plant-based
and cell-based meat.

00:04:41.673 --> 00:04:46.966
Look, tens of thousands of people
died from antibiotic-resistant superbugs

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.475
in North America just last year.

00:04:50.004 --> 00:04:55.309
By 2050, that number is going to be
10 million per year globally.

00:04:56.091 --> 00:05:00.019
And climate change represents
an existential threat

00:05:00.043 --> 00:05:03.199
to huge portions of our global family,

00:05:03.223 --> 00:05:06.652
including some of the poorest people
on the face of the planet.

00:05:07.396 --> 00:05:11.678
Climate change, antibiotic resistance --
these are global emergencies.

00:05:12.263 --> 00:05:16.780
Meat production is exacerbating
these emergencies on a global scale.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.039
But we are not going
to decrease meat consumption

00:05:20.063 --> 00:05:22.581
unless we give consumers alternatives

00:05:22.605 --> 00:05:26.954
that cost the same or less
and that taste the same or better.

00:05:27.637 --> 00:05:28.968
We have the solution.

00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:33.393
Let's make meat from plants.
Let's grow it directly from cells.

00:05:33.417 --> 00:05:37.390
It's past time that we mobilize
the resources that are necessary

00:05:37.414 --> 00:05:41.773
to create the next global
agricultural revolution.

00:05:42.252 --> 00:05:43.412
Thank you.

00:05:43.436 --> 00:05:47.260
(Applause)
