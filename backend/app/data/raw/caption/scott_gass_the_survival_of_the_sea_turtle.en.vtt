00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.365
Sea turtles are miraculous.

00:00:17.158 --> 00:00:19.660
First, they've been around
since the late Jurassic,

00:00:19.684 --> 00:00:21.777
roughly 150 million years ago.

00:00:22.364 --> 00:00:23.965
Cohorts of the dinosaurs,

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.210
sea turtles have survived
through the challenges of eons,

00:00:27.234 --> 00:00:28.758
existing still today,

00:00:28.782 --> 00:00:31.520
where many others
have ended their evolutionary run.

00:00:31.847 --> 00:00:34.804
Second, throughout the centuries
and up till today,

00:00:34.828 --> 00:00:38.216
every living adult sea turtle
has overcome the odds,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.684
existing as a consequence of chance,

00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:42.698
skill, and capability.

00:00:42.722 --> 00:00:46.861
The gauntlet each sea turtle faces
in the course of its lifetime goes thus:

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.032
First, deposited as a clutch of leathery,
ping-pong ball-sized eggs

00:00:52.056 --> 00:00:55.134
into a nesting pit dug by its mother
high on the beach,

00:00:55.158 --> 00:00:57.338
of the 50 to 200 eggs laid,

00:00:57.362 --> 00:00:59.628
roughly 20 percent will never hatch.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.836
Roughly a month and a half
after having been laid,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.325
the surviving eggs hatch,

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.957
and the young turtles, each small enough
to fit in the palm of your hand,

00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:11.328
squirm to the surface,
emerging from the sand en masse,

00:01:11.352 --> 00:01:13.507
and making their desperate
dash for the sea.

00:01:13.914 --> 00:01:17.068
Along the way, debris, pitfalls, crabs,

00:01:17.092 --> 00:01:19.270
gulls, raccoons, and other threats

00:01:19.294 --> 00:01:22.671
will claim roughly 50 percent of those
who rose from the sand.

00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:25.432
For those that actually reach the surf,

00:01:25.456 --> 00:01:27.653
they trade one set of threats for another,

00:01:27.677 --> 00:01:30.421
as they first face
the repelling force of the waves,

00:01:30.445 --> 00:01:33.471
and then find a whole new
host of predators awaiting them:

00:01:33.923 --> 00:01:37.178
Various fish, dolphins,
sharks, and sea birds,

00:01:37.202 --> 00:01:39.905
as the young turtles
come to the surface for air.

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:41.771
For their first few days of life,

00:01:41.795 --> 00:01:44.086
should they count themselves
amongst the living,

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.746
the vulnerable turtles
swim frantically forward.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.317
Ultimately, they will often
look to settle in a patch of flotsam,

00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:52.609
preferably a patch of floating seaweed.

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:54.530
Now for the next several months,

00:01:54.554 --> 00:01:56.943
they will seek to avoid
those that would eat them,

00:01:56.967 --> 00:01:59.013
find that which they might eat themselves,

00:01:59.037 --> 00:02:01.489
and not fall to the pressures
of challenging weather

00:02:01.513 --> 00:02:02.894
or unfortunate currents.

00:02:03.285 --> 00:02:06.942
In this phase, roughly 50 percent
of those who reach the surf

00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:08.164
will perish.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.890
Ultimately, with the passage of years,

00:02:10.914 --> 00:02:12.934
the survivors will increase in size,

00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.829
from that of a dinner plate at year one

00:02:14.853 --> 00:02:16.140
to that of a dinner table,

00:02:16.164 --> 00:02:18.826
in the case of one species
at least, the leatherback,

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.211
a decade or so later.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.395
With size comes
some measure of protection.

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:27.618
The only truly worrisome predators
now are some of the larger shark species--

00:02:27.642 --> 00:02:29.807
bulls, tigers, and whites --

00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:31.601
and the occasional killer whale.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.246
At approximately two decades of age,

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.976
the survivors will be old enough
themselves to breed,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.267
and continue the cycle
which their very existence heralds.

00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:43.134
Of those that began
as eggs on a distant beach,

00:02:43.158 --> 00:02:45.854
now less than 10 percent remain,

00:02:45.878 --> 00:02:49.589
at least, those were the odds
prior to significant human interference.

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:54.616
Over the past century, and in particular
in the last several decades,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.877
human endeavors, from beach development

00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:00.926
to plastic refuse to poaching,
long lines, nets,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.545
and even noxious chemicals, including oil,

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.646
have upped the ante for sea turtles,

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.976
causing their survival rate to drop
to around one percent or less,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.831
from each nesting cycle.

00:03:11.855 --> 00:03:14.533
It is this added human pressure
which has pushed

00:03:14.557 --> 00:03:16.312
each of the eight sea turtle species

00:03:16.336 --> 00:03:18.795
into either a threatened
or endangered state.

00:03:19.591 --> 00:03:22.796
For while they have evolved
to overcome a host of obstacles,

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.292
the most recent has arisen so quickly

00:03:25.316 --> 00:03:29.194
and at such scale that the species
find themselves overwhelmed.

00:03:29.874 --> 00:03:32.237
So let's quickly recap this cycle of odds.

00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:34.043
Using a hypothetical nesting season,

00:03:34.067 --> 00:03:36.976
for females may nest
multiple times in a single year,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.109
of 1,000 eggs, for sake of ease.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.169
1000 eggs laid.

00:03:41.898 --> 00:03:43.145
800 hatch.

00:03:43.784 --> 00:03:45.661
400 make it to the water.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.780
200 progress toward adulthood.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.811
20 survive to breeding age --

00:03:51.835 --> 00:03:53.945
that is, without human interference.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.549
Two survive to breeding age
with human interference.

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:04.115
So a breeding adult sea turtle
is the very embodiment of a long shot.

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.188
It is the exception, not the rule.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.863
A jackpot.

00:04:07.887 --> 00:04:10.475
It is, in a very real sense,

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:11.649
a miracle.
