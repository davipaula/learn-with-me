00:00:12.635 --> 00:00:15.607
My mom has always reminded me

00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:18.928
that I have the same
proportions as a LEGO man.

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:20.365
(Laughter)

00:00:20.389 --> 00:00:22.563
And she does actually have a point.

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:25.910
LEGO is a company that has succeeded

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:30.823
in making everybody believe
that LEGO is from their home country.

00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:33.595
But it's not, it's from my home country.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.269
So you can imagine my excitement
when the LEGO family called me

00:00:37.293 --> 00:00:40.262
and asked us to work with them
to design the Home of the Brick.

00:00:40.988 --> 00:00:44.470
This is the architectural model --
we built it out of LEGO, obviously.

00:00:44.494 --> 00:00:45.979
This is the final result.

00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:48.211
And what we tried to do was to design

00:00:48.235 --> 00:00:52.822
a building that would be as interactive
and as engaging and as playful

00:00:52.846 --> 00:00:54.346
as LEGO is itself,

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.406
with these kind of interconnected
playgrounds on the roofscape.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.275
You can enter a square on the ground

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:03.320
where the citizens of Billund
can roam around freely without a ticket.

00:01:04.027 --> 00:01:06.718
And it's probably one of the only
museums in the world

00:01:06.742 --> 00:01:09.765
where you're allowed
to touch all the artifacts.

00:01:10.948 --> 00:01:16.849
But the Danish word for design
is "formgivning," which literally means

00:01:16.873 --> 00:01:21.033
to give form to that
which has not yet been given form.

00:01:21.057 --> 00:01:24.381
In other words,
to give form to the future.

00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:28.724
And what I love about LEGO
is that LEGO is not a toy.

00:01:28.748 --> 00:01:34.192
It's a tool that empowers the child
to build his or her own world,

00:01:34.216 --> 00:01:36.327
and then to inhabit
that world through play

00:01:36.351 --> 00:01:40.833
and to invite her friends to join her
in cohabiting and cocreating that world.

00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:43.992
And that is exactly what formgivning is.

00:01:44.016 --> 00:01:49.722
As human beings, we have the power
to give form to our future.

00:01:50.722 --> 00:01:51.937
Inspired by LEGO,

00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:55.785
we've built a social housing
project in Copenhagen,

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:59.388
where we stacked blocks
of wood next to each other.

00:01:59.412 --> 00:02:04.041
Between them, they leave spaces
with extra ceiling heights and balconies.

00:02:04.065 --> 00:02:06.636
And by gently wiggling the blocks,

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.271
we can actually create curves
or any organic form,

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:12.355
adapting to any urban context.

00:02:12.918 --> 00:02:17.767
Because adaptability is probably one
of the strongest drivers of architecture.

00:02:18.165 --> 00:02:20.145
Another example is here in Vancouver.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.577
We were asked to look at the site
where Granville bridge triforks

00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:26.134
as it touches downtown.

00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:29.228
And we started, like,
mapping the different constraints.

00:02:29.252 --> 00:02:31.855
There's like a 100-foot
setback from the bridge

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.575
because the city want to make sure

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.640
that no one looks
into the traffic on the bridge.

00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:40.196
There's a park where
we can't cast any shadows.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.545
So finally, we're left with a tiny
triangular footprint,

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:45.303
almost too small to build.

00:02:45.743 --> 00:02:46.982
But then we thought, like,

00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:51.241
what if the 100-foot minimum distance
is really about minimum distance --

00:02:51.265 --> 00:02:55.313
once we get 100 feet up in the air,
we can grow the building back out.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.986
And so we did.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.494
When you drive over the bridge,

00:02:58.518 --> 00:03:01.185
it's as if someone is pulling
a curtain aback,

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.212
welcoming you to Vancouver.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.943
Or a like a weed growing
through the cracks in the pavement

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:09.529
and blossoming as it gets light and air.

00:03:09.553 --> 00:03:12.855
Underneath the bridge,
we've worked with Rodney Graham

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.315
and a handful of Vancouver artists,

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:19.506
to create what we called
the Sistine Chapel of street art,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.474
an art gallery turned upside down,

00:03:21.498 --> 00:03:25.776
that tries to turn the negative
impact of the bridge into a positive.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.799
So even if it looks like
this kind of surreal architecture,

00:03:28.823 --> 00:03:31.728
it's highly adapted to its surroundings.

00:03:32.966 --> 00:03:37.322
So if a bridge can become a museum,
a museum can also serve as a bridge.

00:03:37.346 --> 00:03:41.752
In Norway, we are building a museum
that spans across a river

00:03:41.776 --> 00:03:45.045
and allows people to sort of journey
through the exhibitions

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.278
as they cross from one side
of a sculpture park to the other.

00:03:48.981 --> 00:03:52.381
An architecture sort of
adapted to its landscape.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.029
In China, we built a headquarters
for an energy company

00:03:57.053 --> 00:04:00.617
and we designed the facade
like an Issey Miyake fabric.

00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:04.379
It's rippled, so that facing
the predominant direction of the sun,

00:04:04.403 --> 00:04:05.863
it's all opaque;

00:04:05.887 --> 00:04:08.577
facing away from the sun, it's all glass.

00:04:08.601 --> 00:04:12.292
On average, it sort of transitions
from solid to clear.

00:04:12.704 --> 00:04:15.443
And this very simple idea
without any moving parts

00:04:15.467 --> 00:04:17.014
or any sort of technology,

00:04:17.038 --> 00:04:19.743
purely because
of the geometry of the facade,

00:04:19.767 --> 00:04:23.401
reduces the energy consumption
on cooling by 30 percent.

00:04:24.672 --> 00:04:27.433
So you can say what makes
the building look elegant

00:04:27.457 --> 00:04:29.942
is also what makes it perform elegantly.

00:04:29.966 --> 00:04:32.990
It's an architecture
that is adapted to its climate.

00:04:33.014 --> 00:04:36.482
You can also adapt one culture to another,

00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:40.677
like in Manhattan, we took
the Copenhagen courtyard building

00:04:40.701 --> 00:04:42.950
with a social space
where people can hang out

00:04:42.974 --> 00:04:45.117
in this kind of oasis
in the middle of a city,

00:04:45.141 --> 00:04:47.735
and we combined it with the density
and the verticality

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.172
of an American skyscraper,

00:04:49.196 --> 00:04:52.187
creating what we've called
a "courtscraper."

00:04:52.752 --> 00:04:55.316
From New York to Copenhagen.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.037
On the waterfront of Copenhagen,

00:04:57.061 --> 00:05:01.613
we are right now finishing this
waste-to-energy power plant.

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:05.428
It's going to be the cleanest
waste-to-energy power plant in the world,

00:05:05.452 --> 00:05:07.626
there are no toxins
coming out of the chimney.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.685
An amazing marvel of engineering
that is completely invisible.

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:13.309
So we thought, how can we express this?

00:05:14.082 --> 00:05:16.963
And in Copenhagen
we have snow, as you can see,

00:05:16.987 --> 00:05:19.550
but we have absolutely no mountains.

00:05:20.217 --> 00:05:23.011
We have to go six hours by bus
to get to Sweden,

00:05:23.035 --> 00:05:24.376
to get alpine skiing.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.130
So we thought,
let's put an alpine ski slope

00:05:27.154 --> 00:05:29.107
on the roof of the power plant.

00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:32.600
So this is the first test run
we did a few months ago.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.537
And what I like about this

00:05:34.561 --> 00:05:39.751
is that it also show you the sort of
world-changing power of formgivning.

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:42.037
I have a five-month-old son,

00:05:42.061 --> 00:05:44.418
and he's going to grow up in a world

00:05:44.442 --> 00:05:46.420
not knowing that there was ever a time

00:05:46.444 --> 00:05:49.371
when you couldn't ski
on the roof of the power plant.

00:05:49.395 --> 00:05:51.474
(Laughter)

00:05:51.498 --> 00:05:55.363
(Applause)

00:05:55.387 --> 00:05:58.982
So imagine for him and his generation,
that's their baseline.

00:05:59.006 --> 00:06:00.910
Imagine how far they can leap,

00:06:00.934 --> 00:06:04.572
what kind of wild ideas
they can put forward for their future.

00:06:05.453 --> 00:06:09.238
So right in front of it,
we're building our smallest project.

00:06:09.598 --> 00:06:12.556
It's basically nine containers

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.357
that we have stacked
in a shipyard in Poland,

00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:17.738
then we've schlepped it
across the Baltic sea

00:06:17.762 --> 00:06:19.944
and docked it in the port of Copenhagen,

00:06:19.968 --> 00:06:23.071
where it is now the home of 12 students.

00:06:23.095 --> 00:06:25.394
Each student has a view to the water,

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:28.831
they can jump out the window
into the clean port of Copenhagen,

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:30.156
and they can get back in.

00:06:30.768 --> 00:06:33.926
All of the heat comes
from the thermal mass of the sea,

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.966
all the power comes from the sun.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.990
This is the first 12 units in Copenhagen,

00:06:38.014 --> 00:06:39.928
another 60 on their way,

00:06:39.952 --> 00:06:42.347
another 200 are going to Gothenburg,

00:06:42.371 --> 00:06:44.446
and we're speaking with the Paris Olympics

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.067
to put a small floating
village on the Seine.

00:06:47.633 --> 00:06:52.037
So very much this kind of, almost like
nomadic, impermanent architecture.

00:06:52.061 --> 00:06:55.910
And the waterfronts of our cities
are experiencing a lot of change.

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:59.728
Economic change, industrial change
and climate change.

00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:03.395
This is Manhattan before Hurricane Sandy,

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:05.685
and this is Manhattan after Sandy.

00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:08.054
We got invited by the city of New York

00:07:08.078 --> 00:07:12.339
to look if we could make the necessary
flood protection for Manhattan

00:07:12.363 --> 00:07:14.212
without building a seawall

00:07:14.236 --> 00:07:17.503
that would segregate the life
of the city from the water around it.

00:07:17.527 --> 00:07:19.535
And we got inspired by the High Line.

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:23.471
You probably know the High Line --
it's this amazing new park in New York.

00:07:23.495 --> 00:07:26.728
It's basically decommissioned train tracks

00:07:26.752 --> 00:07:30.299
that now have become one of the most
popular promenades in the city.

00:07:30.323 --> 00:07:31.474
So we thought,

00:07:31.498 --> 00:07:34.879
could we design the necessary
flood protection for Manhattan

00:07:34.903 --> 00:07:39.223
so we don't have to wait
until we shut it down before it gets nice?

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:46.392
So we sat down with the citizens
living along the waterfront of New York,

00:07:46.416 --> 00:07:50.360
and we worked with them to try
to design the necessary flood protection

00:07:50.384 --> 00:07:53.462
in such a way that it only
makes their waterfront

00:07:53.486 --> 00:07:55.714
more accessible and more enjoyable.

00:07:55.738 --> 00:07:58.783
Underneath the FDR,
we are putting, like, pavilions

00:07:58.807 --> 00:08:01.809
with pocket walls that can slide out
and protect from the water.

00:08:01.833 --> 00:08:03.752
We are creating little stepped terraces

00:08:03.776 --> 00:08:06.206
that are going to make
the underside more enjoyable,

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.249
but also protect from flooding.

00:08:09.498 --> 00:08:12.672
Further north in the East River Park,

00:08:12.696 --> 00:08:15.553
we are creating rolling hills

00:08:15.577 --> 00:08:19.625
that protect the park
from the noise of the highway,

00:08:19.649 --> 00:08:23.064
but in turn also become
the necessary flood protection

00:08:23.088 --> 00:08:26.895
that can stop the waves during
an incoming storm surge.

00:08:28.001 --> 00:08:32.498
So in a way, this project
that we have called the Dryline,

00:08:32.522 --> 00:08:34.097
it's essentially the High Line --

00:08:34.121 --> 00:08:35.672
(Laughter)

00:08:35.696 --> 00:08:38.061
The High Line that's
going to keep Manhattan dry.

00:08:38.085 --> 00:08:40.340
(Applause)

00:08:40.364 --> 00:08:43.993
It's scheduled to break ground
on the first East River portion

00:08:44.017 --> 00:08:45.275
at the end of this year.

00:08:45.299 --> 00:08:47.823
But it has essentially been codesigned

00:08:47.847 --> 00:08:50.437
with the citizens of Lower Manhattan

00:08:50.461 --> 00:08:53.991
to take all of the necessary
infrastructure for resilience

00:08:54.015 --> 00:08:57.976
and give it positive social
and environmental side effects.

00:08:58.762 --> 00:09:04.285
So, New York is not alone
in facing this situation.

00:09:04.309 --> 00:09:07.285
In fact, by 2050,

00:09:07.848 --> 00:09:10.807
90 percent of the major
cities in the world

00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:13.426
are going to be dealing with rising seas.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:14.990
In Hamburg,

00:09:15.014 --> 00:09:16.752
they've created a whole neighborhood

00:09:16.776 --> 00:09:20.446
where the bottom floors are designed
to withstand the inevitable flood.

00:09:20.756 --> 00:09:27.224
In Sweden, they've designed a city
where all of the parks are wet gardens,

00:09:27.248 --> 00:09:30.779
designed to deal with storm water
and waste water.

00:09:31.927 --> 00:09:34.022
So we thought, could we perhaps --

00:09:34.046 --> 00:09:35.550
Actually, today,

00:09:36.292 --> 00:09:41.308
three million people are already
permanently living on the sea.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.250
So we thought, could we actually
imagine a floating city

00:09:45.274 --> 00:09:49.252
designed to incorporate all
of the Sustainable Development Goals

00:09:49.276 --> 00:09:50.815
of the United Nations

00:09:50.839 --> 00:09:55.363
into a whole new human-made ecosystem.

00:09:55.387 --> 00:09:59.760
And of course, we have to design it
so it can produce its own power,

00:09:59.784 --> 00:10:02.363
harvesting the thermal mass of the oceans,

00:10:02.387 --> 00:10:05.561
the force of the tides,
of the currents, of the waves,

00:10:05.585 --> 00:10:07.323
the power of the wind,

00:10:07.347 --> 00:10:09.462
the heat and the energy of the sun.

00:10:10.091 --> 00:10:13.468
Also, we are going to collect
all of the rain water that drops

00:10:13.492 --> 00:10:15.607
on this man-made archipelago

00:10:15.631 --> 00:10:18.679
and deal with it organically
and mechanically

00:10:18.703 --> 00:10:20.436
and store it and clean it.

00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:23.934
We have to grow all of our food locally,

00:10:23.958 --> 00:10:26.482
it has to be fish- and plant-based,

00:10:26.506 --> 00:10:30.920
because you won't have the space
or the resources for a dairy diet.

00:10:31.661 --> 00:10:34.264
And finally,

00:10:34.288 --> 00:10:37.105
we are going to deal
with all the waste locally,

00:10:37.129 --> 00:10:41.671
with compost, recycling,
and turning the waste into energy.

00:10:41.695 --> 00:10:45.521
So imagine where a traditional
urban master plan,

00:10:45.545 --> 00:10:48.846
you typically draw the street grid
where the cars can drive

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.521
and the building plots
where you can put some buildings.

00:10:51.545 --> 00:10:55.259
This master plan, we sat down
with a handful of scientists

00:10:55.283 --> 00:10:57.644
and basically started
with all of the renewable,

00:10:57.668 --> 00:10:59.600
available natural resources,

00:10:59.624 --> 00:11:02.403
and then we started channeling
the flow of resources

00:11:02.427 --> 00:11:07.474
through this kind of human-made ecosystem
or this kind of urban metabolism.

00:11:08.466 --> 00:11:11.037
So it's going to be modular,

00:11:11.511 --> 00:11:12.905
it's going to be buoyant,

00:11:12.929 --> 00:11:16.418
it's going to be designed
to resist a tropical storm.

00:11:16.442 --> 00:11:18.712
You can prefabricate it at scale,

00:11:18.736 --> 00:11:23.395
and tow it to dock with others,
to form a small community.

00:11:23.419 --> 00:11:26.063
We're designing these
kind of coastal additions,

00:11:26.087 --> 00:11:28.490
so that even if it's modular and rational,

00:11:28.514 --> 00:11:31.762
each island can be unique
with its own coastal landscape.

00:11:32.376 --> 00:11:35.225
The architecture
has to remain relatively low

00:11:35.249 --> 00:11:38.147
to keep the center of gravity buoyant.

00:11:38.171 --> 00:11:41.353
We're going to take all of the agriculture

00:11:41.726 --> 00:11:43.792
and use it to also create social space

00:11:43.816 --> 00:11:46.849
so you can actually enjoy
the permaculture gardens.

00:11:46.873 --> 00:11:50.323
We're designing it for the tropics,
so all of the roofs are maximized

00:11:50.347 --> 00:11:53.492
to harvest solar power
and to shade from the sun.

00:11:54.212 --> 00:11:56.776
All the materials are going to be
light and renewable,

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.403
like bamboo and wood,

00:11:58.427 --> 00:12:02.387
which is also going to create
this charming, warm environment.

00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:07.381
And any architecture is supposed
to be able to fit on this platform.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.681
Underneath we have all the storage
inside the pontoon,

00:12:11.705 --> 00:12:14.688
almost like a mega version
of the student housings

00:12:14.712 --> 00:12:16.426
that we've already worked with.

00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:19.292
We have all the storage
for the energy that's produced,

00:12:19.316 --> 00:12:21.983
all of the water storage and remediation.

00:12:22.392 --> 00:12:26.820
We are sort of dealing
with all of the waste and the composting.

00:12:27.376 --> 00:12:29.741
And we also have some backup farming

00:12:29.765 --> 00:12:33.389
with aeroponics and hydroponics.

00:12:33.413 --> 00:12:37.294
So imagine almost like a vertical section
through this landscape

00:12:37.318 --> 00:12:41.016
that goes from the air above,
where we have vertical farms;

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.771
below, we have the aeroponics
and the aquaponics.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.236
Even further below,
we have the ocean farms

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.903
and where we tie the island to the ground,

00:12:50.927 --> 00:12:55.856
we're using biorock to create new reefs
to regenerate habitat.

00:12:56.348 --> 00:12:59.967
So think of this
small island for 300 people.

00:12:59.991 --> 00:13:03.125
It can then group together
to form a cluster or a neighborhood

00:13:03.692 --> 00:13:07.902
that then can sort of group together
to form an entire city for 10,000 people.

00:13:08.318 --> 00:13:11.080
And you can imagine
if this floating city flourishes,

00:13:11.532 --> 00:13:15.400
it can sort of grow
like a culture in a petri dish.

00:13:16.659 --> 00:13:20.119
So one of the first places
we are looking at placing this,

00:13:20.143 --> 00:13:21.760
or anchoring this floating city,

00:13:21.784 --> 00:13:23.641
is in the Pearl River delta.

00:13:23.665 --> 00:13:26.848
So imagine this kind of canopy
of photovoltaics

00:13:26.872 --> 00:13:29.601
on this archipelago floating in the sea.

00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:33.442
As you sail towards the island,
you will see the maritime residents

00:13:33.466 --> 00:13:37.783
moving around on alternative forms
of aquatic transportation.

00:13:37.807 --> 00:13:40.765
You come into this kind of community port.

00:13:40.789 --> 00:13:43.704
You can roam around
in the permaculture gardens

00:13:43.728 --> 00:13:46.789
that are productive landscapes,
but also social landscapes.

00:13:47.363 --> 00:13:52.051
The greenhouses also become orangeries
for the cultural life of the city,

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.680
and below, under the sea,

00:13:54.704 --> 00:13:58.974
it's teeming with life
of farming and science

00:13:58.998 --> 00:14:00.728
and social spaces.

00:14:00.752 --> 00:14:03.823
So in a way, you can imagine
this community port

00:14:03.847 --> 00:14:06.934
is where people gather,
both by day and by night.

00:14:07.284 --> 00:14:10.291
And even if the first one
is designed for the tropics,

00:14:10.315 --> 00:14:13.535
we also imagine that the architecture
can adapt to any culture,

00:14:13.559 --> 00:14:16.464
so imagine, like,
a Middle Eastern floating city

00:14:16.488 --> 00:14:19.307
or Southeast Asian floating city

00:14:19.331 --> 00:14:23.408
or maybe a Scandinavian
floating city one day.

00:14:24.412 --> 00:14:26.840
So maybe just to conclude.

00:14:28.142 --> 00:14:31.570
The human body is 70 percent water.

00:14:32.134 --> 00:14:35.610
And the surface of our planet
is 70 percent water.

00:14:36.623 --> 00:14:37.773
And it's rising.

00:14:38.148 --> 00:14:40.727
And even if the whole world
woke up tomorrow

00:14:40.751 --> 00:14:43.036
and became carbon-neutral over night,

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.222
there are still island nations
that are destined to sink in the seas,

00:14:47.246 --> 00:14:52.032
unless we also develop alternate forms
of floating human habitats.

00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:57.109
And the only constant
in the universe is change.

00:14:57.133 --> 00:15:01.259
Our world is always changing,
and right now, our climate is changing.

00:15:02.014 --> 00:15:05.337
No matter how critical
the crisis is, and it is,

00:15:05.361 --> 00:15:09.868
this is also our collective
human superpower.

00:15:10.345 --> 00:15:13.484
That we have the power to adapt to change

00:15:13.508 --> 00:15:16.841
and we have the power
to give form to our future.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:23.642
(Applause)
