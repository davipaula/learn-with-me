00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.792
I'm going to tell you a story
from 200 years ago.

00:00:16.792 --> 00:00:20.059
In 1820, French astronomer Alexis Bouvard

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:25.309
almost became the second person
in human history to discover a planet.

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.643
He'd been tracking the position
of Uranus across the night sky

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:30.393
using old star catalogs,

00:00:30.417 --> 00:00:32.726
and it didn't quite go around the Sun

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.184
the way that his predictions
said it should.

00:00:35.208 --> 00:00:37.309
Sometimes it was a little too fast,

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.018
sometimes a little too slow.

00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:42.768
Bouvard knew that
his predictions were perfect.

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:46.059
So it had to be that those
old star catalogs were bad.

00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:48.143
He told astronomers of the day,

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:50.601
"Do better measurements."

00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:51.893
So they did.

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:54.059
Astronomers spent the next two decades

00:00:54.083 --> 00:00:58.143
meticulously tracking the position
of Uranus across the sky,

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:01.851
but it still didn't fit
Bouvard's predictions.

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:04.018
By 1840, it had become obvious.

00:01:04.042 --> 00:01:07.101
The problem was not
with those old star catalogs,

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:09.976
the problem was with the predictions.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.518
And astronomers knew why.

00:01:11.542 --> 00:01:15.726
They realized that there must be
a distant, giant planet

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.434
just beyond the orbit of Uranus

00:01:17.458 --> 00:01:19.268
that was tugging along at that orbit,

00:01:19.292 --> 00:01:21.851
sometimes pulling it along a bit too fast,

00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:23.542
sometimes holding it back.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.768
Must have been frustrating back in 1840

00:01:26.792 --> 00:01:30.184
to see these gravitational effects
of this distant, giant planet

00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:33.976
but not yet know how to actually find it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.059
Trust me, it's really frustrating.

00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:37.559
(Laughter)

00:01:37.583 --> 00:01:39.809
But in 1846, another French astronomer,

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.143
Urbain Le Verrier,

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:42.434
worked through the math

00:01:42.458 --> 00:01:45.184
and figured out how to predict
the location of the planet.

00:01:45.208 --> 00:01:48.184
He sent his prediction
to the Berlin observatory,

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:49.643
they opened up their telescope

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:52.726
and in the very first night
they found this faint point of light

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.851
slowly moving across the sky

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:56.143
and discovered Neptune.

00:01:56.167 --> 00:02:00.292
It was this close on the sky
to Le Verrier's predicted location.

00:02:01.875 --> 00:02:06.393
The story of prediction
and discrepancy and new theory

00:02:06.417 --> 00:02:09.476
and triumphant discoveries is so classic

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.393
and Le Verrier became so famous from it,

00:02:12.417 --> 00:02:15.143
that people tried to get in
on the act right away.

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:17.684
In the last 163 years,

00:02:17.708 --> 00:02:23.309
dozens of astronomers have used
some sort of alleged orbital discrepancy

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:27.250
to predict the existence
of some new planet in the solar system.

00:02:28.292 --> 00:02:31.000
They have always been wrong.

00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:34.309
The most famous
of these erroneous predictions

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:35.768
came from Percival Lowell,

00:02:35.792 --> 00:02:40.518
who was convinced that there must be
a planet just beyond Uranus and Neptune,

00:02:40.542 --> 00:02:42.518
messing with those orbits.

00:02:42.542 --> 00:02:45.101
And so when Pluto was discovered in 1930

00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:46.768
at the Lowell Observatory,

00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:51.226
everybody assumed that it must be
the planet that Lowell had predicted.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.643
They were wrong.

00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:57.768
It turns out, Uranus and Neptune
are exactly where they're supposed to be.

00:02:57.792 --> 00:02:59.351
It took 100 years,

00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:01.143
but Bouvard was eventually right.

00:03:01.167 --> 00:03:04.768
Astronomers needed to do
better measurements.

00:03:04.792 --> 00:03:06.559
And when they did,

00:03:06.583 --> 00:03:09.768
those better measurements
had turned out that

00:03:09.792 --> 00:03:14.809
there is no planet just beyond
the orbit of Uranus and Neptune

00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:17.518
and Pluto is thousands of times too small

00:03:17.542 --> 00:03:20.184
to have any effect on those orbits at all.

00:03:20.208 --> 00:03:23.851
So even though Pluto
turned out not to be the planet

00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:25.476
it was originally thought to be,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.934
it was the first discovery
of what is now known to be

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:33.684
thousands of tiny, icy objects
in orbit beyond the planets.

00:03:33.708 --> 00:03:36.601
Here you can see the orbits of Jupiter,

00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:39.143
Saturn, Uranus and Neptune,

00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:42.184
and in that little circle
in the very center is the Earth

00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:45.184
and the Sun and almost everything
that you know and love.

00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:47.018
And those yellow circles at the edge

00:03:47.042 --> 00:03:49.809
are these icy bodies
out beyond the planets.

00:03:49.833 --> 00:03:52.101
These icy bodies are pushed and pulled

00:03:52.125 --> 00:03:54.268
by the gravitational fields of the planets

00:03:54.292 --> 00:03:56.809
in entirely predictable ways.

00:03:56.833 --> 00:04:01.542
Everything goes around the Sun
exactly the way it is supposed to.

00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.226
Almost.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.309
So in 2003,

00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:08.226
I discovered what was at the time

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.934
the most distant known object
in the entire solar system.

00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.434
It's hard not to look
at that lonely body out there

00:04:14.458 --> 00:04:16.518
and say, oh yeah, sure,
so Lowell was wrong,

00:04:16.542 --> 00:04:18.476
there was no planet just beyond Neptune,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.059
but this, this could be a new planet.

00:04:21.083 --> 00:04:22.559
The real question we had was,

00:04:22.583 --> 00:04:24.893
what kind of orbit
does it have around the Sun?

00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:26.851
Does it go in a circle around the Sun

00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:28.434
like a planet should?

00:04:28.458 --> 00:04:32.351
Or is it just a typical member
of this icy belt of bodies

00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:36.434
that got a little bit tossed outward
and it's now on its way back in?

00:04:36.458 --> 00:04:38.976
This is precisely the question

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.601
the astronomers were trying
to answer about Uranus 200 years ago.

00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:47.393
They did it by using
overlooked observations of Uranus

00:04:47.417 --> 00:04:49.768
from 91 years before its discovery

00:04:49.792 --> 00:04:51.518
to figure out its entire orbit.

00:04:51.542 --> 00:04:53.559
We couldn't go quite that far back,

00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:58.184
but we did find observations
of our object from 13 years earlier

00:04:58.208 --> 00:05:00.893
that allowed us to figure out
how it went around the Sun.

00:05:00.917 --> 00:05:02.184
So the question is,

00:05:02.208 --> 00:05:04.934
is it in a circular orbit
around the Sun, like a planet,

00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:06.351
or is it on its way back in,

00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:08.268
like one of these typical icy bodies?

00:05:08.292 --> 00:05:09.976
And the answer is

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.268
no.

00:05:11.292 --> 00:05:14.059
It has a massively elongated orbit

00:05:14.083 --> 00:05:18.018
that takes 10,000 years
to go around the Sun.

00:05:18.042 --> 00:05:20.059
We named this object Sedna

00:05:20.083 --> 00:05:21.934
after the Inuit goddess of the sea,

00:05:21.958 --> 00:05:26.018
in honor of the cold, icy places
where it spends all of its time.

00:05:26.042 --> 00:05:27.643
We now know that Sedna,

00:05:27.667 --> 00:05:29.434
it's about a third the size of Pluto

00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:31.518
and it's a relatively typical member

00:05:31.542 --> 00:05:34.351
of those icy bodies out beyond Neptune.

00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:38.226
Relatively typical,
except for this bizarre orbit.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.018
You might look at this orbit and say,

00:05:40.042 --> 00:05:42.768
"Yeah, that's bizarre,
10,000 years to go around the Sun,"

00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:44.726
but that's not really the bizarre part.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.941
The bizarre part is
that in those 10,000 years,

00:05:46.965 --> 00:05:50.934
Sedna never comes close
to anything else in the solar system.

00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.268
Even at its closest approach to the Sun,

00:05:53.292 --> 00:05:55.601
Sedna is further from Neptune

00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:57.833
than Neptune is from the Earth.

00:05:59.042 --> 00:06:01.184
If Sedna had had an orbit like this,

00:06:01.208 --> 00:06:03.809
that kisses the orbit of Neptune
once around the Sun,

00:06:03.833 --> 00:06:06.851
that would have actually been
really easy to explain.

00:06:06.875 --> 00:06:08.643
That would have just been an object

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:10.934
that had been in
a circular orbit around the Sun

00:06:10.958 --> 00:06:12.393
in that region of icy bodies,

00:06:12.417 --> 00:06:14.941
had gotten a little bit
too close to Neptune one time,

00:06:14.965 --> 00:06:17.799
and then got slingshot out
and is now on its way back in.

00:06:19.333 --> 00:06:24.059
But Sedna never comes close
to anything known in the solar system

00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:26.476
that could have given it that slingshot.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.518
Neptune can't be responsible,

00:06:28.542 --> 00:06:31.643
but something had to be responsible.

00:06:31.667 --> 00:06:34.601
This was the first time since 1845

00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:39.559
that we saw the gravitational effects
of something in the outer solar system

00:06:39.583 --> 00:06:41.083
and didn't know what it was.

00:06:42.208 --> 00:06:45.101
I actually thought I knew
what the answer was.

00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:49.143
Sure, it could have been
some distant, giant planet

00:06:49.167 --> 00:06:50.434
in the outer solar system,

00:06:50.458 --> 00:06:52.809
but by this time,
that idea was so ridiculous

00:06:52.833 --> 00:06:54.684
and had been so thoroughly discredited

00:06:54.708 --> 00:06:56.518
that I didn't take it very seriously.

00:06:56.542 --> 00:06:57.809
But 4.5 billion years ago,

00:06:57.833 --> 00:07:02.684
when the Sun formed in a cocoon
of hundreds of other stars,

00:07:02.708 --> 00:07:03.976
any one of those stars

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.643
could have gotten
just a little bit too close to Sedna

00:07:06.667 --> 00:07:10.643
and perturbed it onto the orbit
that it has today.

00:07:10.667 --> 00:07:14.559
When that cluster of stars
dissipated into the galaxy,

00:07:14.583 --> 00:07:18.351
the orbit of Sedna would have been
left as a fossil record

00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:20.851
of this earliest history of the Sun.

00:07:20.875 --> 00:07:22.684
I was so excited by this idea,

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:24.184
by the idea that we could look

00:07:24.208 --> 00:07:26.434
at the fossil history
of the birth of the Sun,

00:07:26.458 --> 00:07:28.059
that I spent the next decade

00:07:28.083 --> 00:07:30.809
looking for more objects
with orbits like Sedna.

00:07:30.833 --> 00:07:34.268
In that ten-year period, I found zero.

00:07:34.292 --> 00:07:35.309
(Laughter)

00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:38.851
But my colleagues, Chad Trujillo
and Scott Sheppard, did a better job,

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:41.893
and they have now found several objects
with orbits like Sedna,

00:07:41.917 --> 00:07:43.684
which is super exciting.

00:07:43.708 --> 00:07:45.232
But what's even more interesting

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:48.018
is that they found that all these objects

00:07:48.042 --> 00:07:51.934
are not only on these distant,
elongated orbits,

00:07:51.958 --> 00:07:57.309
they also share a common value
of this obscure orbital parameter

00:07:57.333 --> 00:08:01.292
that in celestial mechanics we call
argument of perihelion.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.184
When they realized it was clustered
in argument of perihelion,

00:08:05.208 --> 00:08:06.976
they immediately jumped up and down,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.976
saying it must be caused
by a distant, giant planet out there,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.059
which is really exciting,
except it makes no sense at all.

00:08:13.083 --> 00:08:15.601
Let me try to explain it
to you why with an analogy.

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:18.934
Imagine a person walking down a plaza

00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:22.292
and looking 45 degrees to his right side.

00:08:23.125 --> 00:08:25.184
There's a lot of reasons
that might happen,

00:08:25.208 --> 00:08:27.143
it's super easy to explain, no big deal.

00:08:27.167 --> 00:08:28.976
Imagine now many different people,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.893
all walking in different
directions across the plaza,

00:08:32.917 --> 00:08:36.184
but all looking 45 degrees
to the direction that they're moving.

00:08:36.208 --> 00:08:38.226
Everybody's moving
in different directions,

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.393
everybody's looking
in different directions,

00:08:40.417 --> 00:08:43.726
but they're all looking 45 degrees
to the direction of motion.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.583
What could cause something like that?

00:08:46.917 --> 00:08:48.184
I have no idea.

00:08:48.208 --> 00:08:51.934
It's very difficult to think of any reason
that that would happen.

00:08:51.958 --> 00:08:53.309
(Laughter)

00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:56.184
And this is essentially
what that clustering

00:08:56.208 --> 00:08:59.601
in argument of perihelion was telling us.

00:08:59.625 --> 00:09:03.184
Scientists were generally baffled
and they assumed it must just be a fluke

00:09:03.208 --> 00:09:04.559
and some bad observations.

00:09:04.583 --> 00:09:06.351
They told the astronomers,

00:09:06.375 --> 00:09:08.768
"Do better measurements."

00:09:08.792 --> 00:09:11.893
I actually took a very careful look
at those measurements, though,

00:09:11.917 --> 00:09:13.184
and they were right.

00:09:13.208 --> 00:09:15.101
These objects really did all share

00:09:15.125 --> 00:09:17.601
a common value of argument of perihelion,

00:09:17.625 --> 00:09:19.018
and they shouldn't.

00:09:19.042 --> 00:09:21.250
Something had to be causing that.

00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:27.434
The final piece of the puzzle
came into place in 2016,

00:09:27.458 --> 00:09:29.976
when my colleague, Konstantin Batygin,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.643
who works three doors down from me, and I

00:09:32.667 --> 00:09:35.268
realized that the reason
that everybody was baffled

00:09:35.292 --> 00:09:40.018
was because argument of perihelion
was only part of the story.

00:09:40.042 --> 00:09:42.101
If you look at these
objects the right way,

00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:46.184
they are all actually lined up
in space in the same direction,

00:09:46.208 --> 00:09:49.934
and they're all tilted in space
in the same direction.

00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:54.309
It's as if all those people on the plaza
are all walking in the same direction

00:09:54.333 --> 00:09:57.768
and they're all looking
45 degrees to the right side.

00:09:57.792 --> 00:09:59.059
That's easy to explain.

00:09:59.083 --> 00:10:01.559
They're all looking at something.

00:10:01.583 --> 00:10:05.708
These objects in the outer solar system
are all reacting to something.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.726
But what?

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.726
Konstantin and I spent a year

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:16.559
trying to come up with any explanation
other than a distant, giant planet

00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:17.851
in the outer solar system.

00:10:17.875 --> 00:10:23.309
We did not want to be the 33rd and 34th
people in history to propose this planet

00:10:23.333 --> 00:10:25.667
to yet again be told we were wrong.

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:28.559
But after a year,

00:10:28.583 --> 00:10:29.893
there was really no choice.

00:10:29.917 --> 00:10:32.059
We could come up with no other explanation

00:10:32.083 --> 00:10:34.583
other than that there is a distant,

00:10:34.625 --> 00:10:37.893
massive planet on an elongated orbit,

00:10:37.917 --> 00:10:39.976
inclined to the rest of the solar system,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.726
that is forcing these patterns
for these objects

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.768
in the outer solar system.

00:10:44.792 --> 00:10:46.934
Guess what else a planet like this does.

00:10:46.958 --> 00:10:48.809
Remember that strange orbit of Sedna,

00:10:48.833 --> 00:10:51.768
how it was kind of pulled away
from the Sun in one direction?

00:10:51.792 --> 00:10:55.518
A planet like this would make
orbits like that all day long.

00:10:55.542 --> 00:10:57.851
We knew we were onto something.

00:10:57.875 --> 00:11:00.851
So this brings us to today.

00:11:00.875 --> 00:11:05.059
We are basically 1845, Paris.

00:11:05.083 --> 00:11:06.268
(Laughter)

00:11:06.292 --> 00:11:11.601
We see the gravitational effects
of a distant, giant planet,

00:11:11.625 --> 00:11:13.851
and we are trying to work out
the calculations

00:11:13.875 --> 00:11:16.893
to tell us where to look,
to point our telescopes,

00:11:16.917 --> 00:11:18.184
to find this planet.

00:11:18.208 --> 00:11:20.583
We've done massive suites
of computer simulations,

00:11:21.292 --> 00:11:23.226
massive months of analytic calculations

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:25.809
and here's what I can tell you so far.

00:11:25.833 --> 00:11:29.018
First, this planet,
which we call Planet Nine,

00:11:29.042 --> 00:11:31.625
because that's what it is,

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.018
Planet Nine is six times
the mass of the Earth.

00:11:36.042 --> 00:11:38.268
This is no slightly-smaller-than-Pluto,

00:11:38.292 --> 00:11:41.018
let's-all-argue-about-
whether-it's-a-planet-or-not thing.

00:11:41.042 --> 00:11:44.351
This is the fifth largest planet
in our entire solar system.

00:11:44.375 --> 00:11:48.018
For context, let me show you
the sizes of the planets.

00:11:48.042 --> 00:11:52.184
In the back there,
you can the massive Jupiter and Saturn.

00:11:52.208 --> 00:11:54.851
Next to them, a little bit smaller,
Uranus and Neptune.

00:11:54.875 --> 00:11:58.352
Up in the corner, the terrestrial planets,
Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.

00:11:58.376 --> 00:11:59.726
You can even see that belt

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.893
of icy bodies beyond Neptune,
of which Pluto is a member,

00:12:02.917 --> 00:12:04.775
good luck figuring out which one it is.

00:12:04.799 --> 00:12:07.215
And here is Planet Nine.

00:12:08.583 --> 00:12:11.018
Planet Nine is big.

00:12:11.042 --> 00:12:12.309
Planet Nine is so big,

00:12:12.333 --> 00:12:14.934
you should probably wonder
why haven't we found it yet.

00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:16.226
Well, Planet Nine is big,

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.351
but it's also really, really far away.

00:12:18.375 --> 00:12:23.059
It's something like
15 times further away than Neptune.

00:12:23.083 --> 00:12:26.351
And that makes it about 50,000 times
fainter than Neptune.

00:12:26.375 --> 00:12:29.309
And also, the sky is a really big place.

00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:31.476
We've narrowed down where we think it is

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.018
to a relatively small area of the sky,

00:12:34.042 --> 00:12:35.934
but it would still take us years

00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.309
to systematically cover
the area of the sky

00:12:38.333 --> 00:12:40.184
with the large telescopes that we need

00:12:40.208 --> 00:12:43.518
to see something that's
this far away and this faint.

00:12:43.542 --> 00:12:46.684
Luckily, we might not have to.

00:12:46.708 --> 00:12:51.601
Just like Bouvard used
unrecognized observations of Uranus

00:12:51.625 --> 00:12:54.393
from 91 years before its discovery,

00:12:54.417 --> 00:12:58.184
I bet that there are unrecognized images

00:12:58.208 --> 00:13:01.083
that show the location of Planet Nine.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.059
It's going to be a massive
computational undertaking

00:13:05.083 --> 00:13:07.393
to go through all of the old data

00:13:07.417 --> 00:13:10.333
and pick out that one faint moving planet.

00:13:11.292 --> 00:13:12.643
But we're underway.

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:14.976
And I think we're getting close.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.518
So I would say, get ready.

00:13:17.542 --> 00:13:21.518
We are not going to match Le Verrier's

00:13:21.542 --> 00:13:22.809
"make a prediction,

00:13:22.833 --> 00:13:24.726
have the planet found in a single night

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.934
that close to where
you predicted it" record.

00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:30.893
But I do bet that within
the next couple of years

00:13:30.917 --> 00:13:33.309
some astronomer somewhere

00:13:33.333 --> 00:13:35.559
will find a faint point of light,

00:13:35.583 --> 00:13:37.851
slowly moving across the sky

00:13:37.875 --> 00:13:41.184
and triumphantly announce
the discovery of a new,

00:13:41.208 --> 00:13:43.643
and quite possibly not the last,

00:13:43.667 --> 00:13:46.143
real planet of our solar system.

00:13:46.167 --> 00:13:47.434
Thank you.

00:13:47.458 --> 00:13:51.083
(Applause)
