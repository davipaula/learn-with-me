00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:14.374
How did you discover your passion

00:00:14.398 --> 00:00:15.927
or find your career?

00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:17.367
Were you exposed to it?

00:00:17.391 --> 00:00:19.002
Or was it trial and error?

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.549
As child rights advocate
Marian Wright Edelman said,

00:00:22.573 --> 00:00:25.077
"You can't be what you can't see."

00:00:25.573 --> 00:00:27.788
Fortunately, we now live in a time

00:00:27.812 --> 00:00:31.527
when emerging technologies
may help us to solve this problem.

00:00:32.023 --> 00:00:33.386
For the past two years,

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.157
I've been developing
an extended reality program

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:39.563
that enables middle school students
from across the country

00:00:39.587 --> 00:00:42.185
to take on the role
of a marine biologist --

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:44.487
even if they've never seen the ocean.

00:00:45.454 --> 00:00:48.843
As one seventh grader
who recently completed our program said,

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:50.972
"I could see myself as a scientist,

00:00:50.996 --> 00:00:52.943
because I enjoyed this game."

00:00:53.838 --> 00:00:55.802
This feedback really excited me,

00:00:55.826 --> 00:00:59.255
because too few students
do see themselves as scientists.

00:00:59.849 --> 00:01:05.608
A 2014 study showed that 57 percent
of eighth- and ninth-grade students

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:07.466
said, "Science isn't me."

00:01:08.118 --> 00:01:10.560
Coincidentally, also in 2014,

00:01:10.584 --> 00:01:13.535
I met MandÃ« Holford, a marine biochemist,

00:01:13.559 --> 00:01:16.357
and Lindsay Portnoy,
an educational psychologist.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.638
The three of us shared a passion

00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:22.801
for getting students excited by
and comfortable with science.

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.488
We thought about how
we could give children

00:01:25.512 --> 00:01:28.421
the most realistic experience
of a scientific career.

00:01:28.825 --> 00:01:30.160
We discussed the research;

00:01:30.184 --> 00:01:34.996
it showed that students felt comfortable
taking risks when playing games.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.593
So the three of us started
an educational games company

00:01:38.617 --> 00:01:40.408
to bring science to life.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.758
Virtual reality seemed like
a low-cost way of increasing access.

00:01:45.782 --> 00:01:48.426
In addition, academic research has shown

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.066
that virtual reality may lead
to increases in learning retention.

00:01:52.368 --> 00:01:55.155
This was perfect for us,
as we wanted to be in schools

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.015
so that we could reach
the most number of students possible,

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.170
particularly students who have
been underrepresented in science.

00:02:01.622 --> 00:02:04.683
So, with funding from
the National Science Foundation,

00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:07.414
we began developing
our extended reality program

00:02:07.438 --> 00:02:09.303
that combined virtual reality

00:02:09.327 --> 00:02:11.543
with personalized digital journaling.

00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:14.082
We worked with teachers
while developing it

00:02:14.106 --> 00:02:18.106
to ensure that it would fit seamlessly
into existing curricula

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.155
and empower teachers to use cutting-edge
technology in their classroom.

00:02:22.686 --> 00:02:25.241
We designed the virtual reality
for Google Cardboard,

00:02:25.265 --> 00:02:27.277
which requires only a smartphone

00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:31.440
and a 10 dollar VR viewer 
made of cardboard.

00:02:31.833 --> 00:02:33.744
With this inexpensive headset,

00:02:33.768 --> 00:02:36.787
students are transported
to an underwater expedition.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.129
Students use their digital journal

00:02:39.153 --> 00:02:40.981
to write down their notes,

00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:42.391
to answer questions,

00:02:42.415 --> 00:02:43.732
to construct models

00:02:43.756 --> 00:02:45.275
and to develop hypotheses.

00:02:45.692 --> 00:02:48.965
Students then go to the virtual world
to test their hypotheses

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.455
and see if they're accurate,

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:52.629
much as scientists go to the field

00:02:52.653 --> 00:02:54.323
in their careers.

00:02:55.054 --> 00:02:57.215
When students return
to their digital journal,

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.573
they share their observations, claims,

00:02:59.597 --> 00:03:01.393
reasoning and evidence.

00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:06.086
The students' written answers
and virtual interactions

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.864
are all updated live

00:03:07.888 --> 00:03:09.865
in an educator assessment dashboard,

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.402
so that teachers can follow their progress

00:03:12.426 --> 00:03:15.037
and support them as needed.

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:17.367
To give you a better sense,
I'm going to show you

00:03:17.391 --> 00:03:19.131
a little bit of what students see.

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.649
This is the virtual reality
when they're underwater

00:03:22.673 --> 00:03:25.051
observing the flora and fauna.

00:03:26.615 --> 00:03:29.783
This is the digital journal
where they're constructing their models

00:03:29.807 --> 00:03:32.674
based on this abiotic data
to show what they expect to see.

00:03:33.705 --> 00:03:36.435
Here, they're supporting that
with qualitative statements.

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.204
And this is the educator dashboard
that shows progress

00:03:39.228 --> 00:03:42.629
and enables [teachers]
to see the students' answers as they go.

00:03:44.767 --> 00:03:46.798
When we were creating BioDive,

00:03:46.822 --> 00:03:48.986
again, we really wanted
to focus on access,

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.014
so we designed it to require
only one phone for every four students.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.959
We also knew how collaborative
science work is,

00:03:56.983 --> 00:03:59.847
so we constructed the experience
to only be solved

00:03:59.871 --> 00:04:01.376
through collaborative teamwork,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.999
as each student is an expert
in a different geographic location.

00:04:06.044 --> 00:04:09.057
Given that these children's brains
are still developing,

00:04:09.081 --> 00:04:13.219
we limited each experience to last
a maximum of two minutes.

00:04:13.243 --> 00:04:17.390
And finally, because we know
the importance of repeated exposure

00:04:17.414 --> 00:04:19.086
for internalizing knowledge,

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.759
we constructed BioDive to take place
over five class periods.

00:04:23.642 --> 00:04:27.166
We started piloting BioDive in 2017

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.805
in 20 schools in New York and New Jersey.

00:04:29.829 --> 00:04:33.192
We wanted to see students
as they were using this new technology.

00:04:33.827 --> 00:04:36.023
In 2019, now,

00:04:36.047 --> 00:04:39.453
we are now piloting in 26 states.

00:04:39.995 --> 00:04:42.872
What we have heard from teachers
who have taught our program:

00:04:42.896 --> 00:04:46.929
"It was a nice way to show ocean dynamics
without the luxury of actually being there

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.128
since we are in Ohio."

00:04:48.152 --> 00:04:49.227
(Laughter)

00:04:49.251 --> 00:04:50.577
"It's pretty mind-blowing."

00:04:50.601 --> 00:04:52.737
"The students were totally engaged."

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.740
But what really gives us hope
is what we're hearing from students.

00:04:57.209 --> 00:04:59.099
"I liked how it felt like I was there."

00:04:59.123 --> 00:05:01.600
"It's interactive and a fun way to learn."

00:05:01.624 --> 00:05:05.578
"It really gave me realistic examples
of how these organisms appear."

00:05:06.102 --> 00:05:10.420
"I could see myself as a scientist
because it seems really fun."

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.515
Our feedback wasn't always so positive.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.518
When we began developing,

00:05:15.542 --> 00:05:17.509
we started off by asking students

00:05:17.533 --> 00:05:18.687
what they liked,

00:05:18.711 --> 00:05:19.862
what they didn't like

00:05:19.886 --> 00:05:21.370
and what they found confusing.

00:05:21.742 --> 00:05:25.687
Eventually we began asking
what they wished they could do.

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:29.569
Their feedback gave us
concrete items to build in

00:05:29.593 --> 00:05:33.276
to be sure that we were including
student voices in what we were designing.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.627
Overall, what we have learned is that this
is the beginning of a new platform

00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:41.549
for giving students
both voice and ownership

00:05:41.573 --> 00:05:43.823
in deciding how they want to have impact

00:05:43.847 --> 00:05:45.228
in their careers.

00:05:45.693 --> 00:05:47.253
We focused on science,

00:05:47.277 --> 00:05:48.943
because we know we need scientists

00:05:48.967 --> 00:05:51.994
to help us solve our current
and future challenges.

00:05:52.537 --> 00:05:56.636
But virtual reality could support
students in any area.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.192
How could we support students
in exploring all of their desires

00:06:01.216 --> 00:06:05.336
with these eye-opening experiences
and chances to learn from primary sources?

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.950
Could we create VR
for inexpensive headsets

00:06:09.974 --> 00:06:12.731
that lets them be immersed
in oral literature

00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:15.025
or in critical moments of human history?

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.565
Extended reality has the potential
to change the trajectory

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:21.060
of our children's lives

00:06:21.084 --> 00:06:24.086
and lead them to careers
they never imagined

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.425
by giving them the chance
to see what they can be.

00:06:27.793 --> 00:06:29.005
Thank you.

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:31.753
(Applause)
