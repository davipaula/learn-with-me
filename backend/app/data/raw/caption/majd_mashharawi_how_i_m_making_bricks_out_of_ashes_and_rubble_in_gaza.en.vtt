00:00:13.992 --> 00:00:15.714
Yes, it's dark.

00:00:16.968 --> 00:00:20.397
I'm wondering how long
we can all stand it

00:00:20.421 --> 00:00:25.194
without picking up our phone
and turning the flashlights on.

00:00:25.847 --> 00:00:26.997
Seconds?

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:28.895
Minutes?

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:30.426
A whole hour?

00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:37.566
Don't worry, I'm not going to give you
my whole speech in the dark.

00:00:38.606 --> 00:00:40.673
But it's something I'm used to.

00:00:41.146 --> 00:00:46.344
For more than 10 years,
I and two million people back home

00:00:46.368 --> 00:00:49.240
have been living in darkness,

00:00:49.264 --> 00:00:51.732
locked between two borders

00:00:51.756 --> 00:00:55.507
that are nearly impossible
to leave, literally,

00:00:56.623 --> 00:01:03.013
in an area that spans 25 miles long
and about five miles wide.

00:01:03.942 --> 00:01:07.164
I am Palestinian, and I am from Gaza.

00:01:07.903 --> 00:01:10.503
I grew up there and I still live there.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.232
In Gaza, we have a whole lot of nothing.

00:01:17.812 --> 00:01:21.291
And I aim to create something
from that nothing.

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:24.403
When a community is cut off
from the world,

00:01:24.427 --> 00:01:26.379
all that we need to do is ... what?

00:01:26.403 --> 00:01:28.469
To think outside the box.

00:01:28.871 --> 00:01:30.624
Way outside the box.

00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:37.127
That thinking led me to two projects

00:01:37.151 --> 00:01:40.703
to address two serious issues
in my community.

00:01:41.818 --> 00:01:45.952
The need for building materials
and the need for electricity and energy.

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:49.926
Two essential ingredients of life.

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:54.926
Both are in lack of supply in Gaza.

00:01:57.323 --> 00:02:00.017
First, I'm not here ...

00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:04.977
just to talk about the occupation
we have back home.

00:02:05.902 --> 00:02:10.671
The siege, the wars,
the bombs, the protests

00:02:10.695 --> 00:02:11.895
or the death toll.

00:02:12.545 --> 00:02:17.719
I am here because I wanted to show
that we can live through it all.

00:02:18.497 --> 00:02:21.497
I am here because I wanted
to make a change.

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:23.695
I am here to tell you

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.719
that I am a statistic
that cannot be ignored.

00:02:29.953 --> 00:02:34.968
In the 2014 war, thousands
of houses were destroyed.

00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:42.773
Those houses were made
from sunbaked stones and blocks.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.749
Those houses stood
for decades and decades.

00:02:47.313 --> 00:02:51.466
Those houses were
for my family, friends, neighbors,

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:52.769
everyone I know.

00:02:54.587 --> 00:02:56.769
At that time, I asked myself a question:

00:02:56.793 --> 00:02:58.460
What can I do for people?

00:02:58.952 --> 00:03:00.285
How can I help them?

00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:08.127
I knew we weren't able
to get cement, aggregate and sand

00:03:08.151 --> 00:03:10.619
to rebuild what the war destroyed.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:15.895
But also, maybe we can use something
from inside the community,

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:17.585
something we already had.

00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:20.931
I started to put things together.

00:03:20.955 --> 00:03:25.247
First, paper as a filler,
instead of the aggregate we import.

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:27.243
But that did not work out.

00:03:27.823 --> 00:03:33.333
What about using glass powder
to replace part of the cement?

00:03:33.685 --> 00:03:35.085
But that failed, too.

00:03:36.098 --> 00:03:39.571
I guessed making building blocks
out of mud would be a great idea.

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:42.939
But unfortunately, it didn't work out.

00:03:43.673 --> 00:03:47.482
During the process
of burning the mud blocks,

00:03:47.506 --> 00:03:51.228
we had a huge amount of ashes.

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:55.015
And I was like, "Why don't we
use those ashes?"

00:03:55.704 --> 00:03:57.863
The idea flashed in my mind.

00:03:57.887 --> 00:04:02.608
"Let's use it and combine it
with the rubble of the demolished houses

00:04:02.632 --> 00:04:04.862
and make building blocks out of it."

00:04:06.378 --> 00:04:10.625
After more than 150 failed experiments,

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:13.561
and over six months of research,

00:04:13.585 --> 00:04:14.852
I actually made it.

00:04:16.688 --> 00:04:23.484
(Applause)

00:04:23.508 --> 00:04:27.248
I created a building block

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.569
out of the ashes and rubble
of the demolished houses.

00:04:34.371 --> 00:04:36.823
It's here, it came all the way with me.

00:04:36.847 --> 00:04:38.447
Well, it came before me.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.847
So, it's lighter,

00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:44.212
it's cheaper, and it's stronger.

00:04:46.094 --> 00:04:53.062
(Applause)

00:04:55.262 --> 00:04:56.799
This building block --

00:04:56.823 --> 00:04:59.950
of course, you ask yourself,
"How did this girl do it?"

00:04:59.974 --> 00:05:02.379
It's not that hard,
and it's not that easy.

00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:06.593
First, we collected rubble
from all around the Gaza Strip.

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.356
Then we combined it with the ashes
that came from the landfills.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.546
When the recipe is done,
it's time for baking.

00:05:14.855 --> 00:05:18.006
So we mold the blocks,
as you can see in the photo,

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.172
and we cure it using water steam.

00:05:22.046 --> 00:05:24.545
I call the material "Green Cake,"

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:28.483
and people now can use it
not only to rebuild old houses,

00:05:28.507 --> 00:05:31.895
but also to build new complete structures.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.950
Green Cake so far has created
jobs for more than 30 people.

00:05:37.688 --> 00:05:42.482
And we were able to rebuild
around 50 apartments,

00:05:42.506 --> 00:05:47.099
each one of them the size
of a household almost for eight people.

00:05:48.704 --> 00:05:55.236
We also trained fresh graduates,
female and male,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.355
which is not very common in the community.

00:05:59.538 --> 00:06:02.538
And we got several awards,
locally and globally.

00:06:03.198 --> 00:06:06.282
This block is not
just only a building block.

00:06:06.306 --> 00:06:09.128
It changed the stereotype
about women in Gaza

00:06:09.152 --> 00:06:12.849
that stated this type of work
is meant for men.

00:06:15.242 --> 00:06:19.243
Education is the strongest weapon we have

00:06:19.267 --> 00:06:22.726
to fight for our freedom,
decent life and future.

00:06:24.284 --> 00:06:27.474
My background helped me to do this block.

00:06:27.498 --> 00:06:31.609
I went to the Islamic University of Gaza,
and I studied civil engineering,

00:06:31.633 --> 00:06:35.632
where there was a one-to-six
female-to-male ratio.

00:06:36.228 --> 00:06:39.426
Everyone told me
I would end up without a job.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.053
I went for a major that's meant for men.

00:06:44.204 --> 00:06:48.743
But their lack of encouragement
did not deter me; it inspired me.

00:06:49.978 --> 00:06:56.289
(Applause)

00:06:57.112 --> 00:07:00.849
After this long journey with the block,
and after two years,

00:07:00.873 --> 00:07:04.720
what Gaza does need
is not just building blocks.

00:07:04.744 --> 00:07:07.547
We also need electricity,
we need the energy.

00:07:09.013 --> 00:07:12.902
I developed a new company called SunBox.

00:07:13.363 --> 00:07:16.768
SunBox is a smart solar kit
that we source from China,

00:07:16.792 --> 00:07:19.116
and we engineer it to fit the market need.

00:07:19.942 --> 00:07:23.687
It powers not only light,
but also laptops, phones,

00:07:23.711 --> 00:07:26.044
internet connection, a fan or a TV.

00:07:26.743 --> 00:07:29.195
We teach local vendors and technicians

00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:33.018
to sell, install and provide
customer services for people.

00:07:34.303 --> 00:07:36.541
We got the project off the ground

00:07:36.565 --> 00:07:39.596
by providing 15 families
with solar energy.

00:07:40.883 --> 00:07:43.470
One of the solar units
we installed in a refugee camp.

00:07:43.494 --> 00:07:46.405
The next day I came to check
what happened with the solar,

00:07:46.429 --> 00:07:49.233
and I found a whole neighborhood
watching a football match

00:07:49.257 --> 00:07:50.562
using our device.

00:07:50.586 --> 00:07:54.685
I was like, "Wow, that's going to create
a huge impact in the community."

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.525
That encouraged us to go
to the second round

00:07:58.549 --> 00:08:01.566
of bringing 200 units.

00:08:02.156 --> 00:08:04.815
But each unit costs around 350 dollars.

00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:08.768
And a Palestinian family
can't afford the 350 dollars.

00:08:08.792 --> 00:08:10.942
So we had to think, again,
outside the box:

00:08:10.966 --> 00:08:12.656
How can we make this happen?

00:08:13.006 --> 00:08:17.222
If a whole neighborhood can watch
a football match using one device,

00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:21.118
it means two, three and four families
can share one device

00:08:21.142 --> 00:08:22.876
and enjoy the electricity.

00:08:24.111 --> 00:08:26.347
What we did is, we created
a new business model

00:08:26.371 --> 00:08:29.117
called "sharing is caring."

00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:31.069
(Laughter)

00:08:31.093 --> 00:08:33.505
The sharing is caring business model

00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:37.307
says two families share one unit,
three families share one unit,

00:08:37.331 --> 00:08:40.093
and they split the cost,
so they can afford paying for it.

00:08:40.871 --> 00:08:42.736
Well, the idea caught on.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.649
I didn't expect that,
but it just happened.

00:08:45.673 --> 00:08:46.940
In less than two weeks,

00:08:46.964 --> 00:08:50.972
we were able to provide
over 200 people with electricity.

00:08:51.674 --> 00:08:57.495
(Applause)

00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:00.463
And the question here:
How did the idea catch on?

00:09:01.149 --> 00:09:03.507
We went to community centers --

00:09:03.531 --> 00:09:05.443
those are places, you know for whom?

00:09:05.467 --> 00:09:06.625
Only for men.

00:09:06.649 --> 00:09:08.736
So it was so weird
for a woman to go there.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.672
And I told them, "We have a great idea.

00:09:10.696 --> 00:09:12.101
We will give you electricity,

00:09:12.125 --> 00:09:14.426
you give us people
who need this electricity."

00:09:16.641 --> 00:09:20.109
Now, families are approaching us
from all around the Gaza Strip.

00:09:20.133 --> 00:09:22.910
I received a phone call
from the team this morning, saying,

00:09:22.934 --> 00:09:26.451
"Majd, please, we are under pressure,
we work 16 hours a day,

00:09:26.475 --> 00:09:28.515
we will not be able to work like this.

00:09:28.539 --> 00:09:32.110
Families are calling us every second.
They want solar energy."

00:09:33.569 --> 00:09:37.522
Muna, from one of the families
we installed the solar unit for,

00:09:37.546 --> 00:09:39.561
she told me, "You know, Majd,

00:09:40.536 --> 00:09:44.142
I've never imagined I will control
something in my life.

00:09:44.664 --> 00:09:47.911
Now I can control my source of energy.

00:09:47.935 --> 00:09:49.201
I feel so special."

00:09:50.133 --> 00:09:54.831
What you take for granted
is a privilege for others.

00:09:56.494 --> 00:09:57.789
People like Muna.

00:09:58.545 --> 00:10:00.748
She doesn't want to fight.

00:10:00.772 --> 00:10:05.037
She doesn't want to stay in a bad life.

00:10:05.061 --> 00:10:07.528
She's only looking for a better life.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:12.768
Our vision, or I would say,
everyone's vision in Gaza --

00:10:12.792 --> 00:10:16.590
which I am very privileged
to represent the people back home --

00:10:16.614 --> 00:10:19.701
is to have a good life, a future.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.836
We need to build
the infrastructure of hope.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.918
We want to tell them
it's possible to happen,

00:10:26.942 --> 00:10:29.712
it's possible to be treated
as a human being.

00:10:29.736 --> 00:10:32.181
I don't have to cross
four borders to come here.

00:10:32.205 --> 00:10:33.908
I can just go to the airport,

00:10:33.932 --> 00:10:35.278
see the people outside,

00:10:35.302 --> 00:10:37.302
see what the world looks like.

00:10:38.651 --> 00:10:39.873
Thank you so much.

00:10:39.897 --> 00:10:44.095
(Applause)
