00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:13.031
For most of the year, the Gulf of Mexico
is teeming with marine life,

00:00:13.031 --> 00:00:17.630
from tiny crustaceans 
to massive baleen whales.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.310
But every summer, disaster strikes.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.180
Around May, 
animals begin to flee the area.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.879
And soon, creatures that can’t swim 
or can’t swim fast enough

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:33.969
begin to suffocate and die off
in massive numbers.

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.809
From late spring to early autumn,

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.402
thousands of square kilometers 
along the coast become a marine dead zone—

00:00:42.402 --> 00:00:47.098
unable to support 
most forms of aquatic life.

00:00:47.098 --> 00:00:50.878
This strange annual curse isn’t unique;

00:00:50.878 --> 00:00:55.318
dead zones like this one 
have formed all over the world.

00:00:55.318 --> 00:00:58.548
But to explore what’s creating 
these lethal conditions,

00:00:58.548 --> 00:01:05.072
we first need to understand 
how a healthy marine ecosystem functions.

00:01:05.072 --> 00:01:09.072
In any body of water that receives 
sufficient sunlight,

00:01:09.072 --> 00:01:15.478
plant-like organisms such as algae 
and cyanobacteria thrive.

00:01:15.478 --> 00:01:19.428
Clouds of algae streak the surface 
of deep waters,

00:01:19.428 --> 00:01:25.632
and in shallower regions, large seaweeds 
and seagrass cover the ground.

00:01:25.632 --> 00:01:30.563
Not only do these organisms form 
the foundation of local food chains,

00:01:30.563 --> 00:01:38.072
their photosynthesis provides the oxygen
necessary for aquatic animals to survive.

00:01:38.072 --> 00:01:40.802
Besides sunlight and C02,

00:01:40.802 --> 00:01:47.227
algae growth also depends on nutrients
like phosphorus and nitrogen.

00:01:47.227 --> 00:01:50.037
While such resources 
are typically in short supply,

00:01:50.037 --> 00:01:56.305
sometimes the surrounding watershed can 
flood coastal waters with these nutrients.

00:01:56.305 --> 00:02:01.688
For example, a large rainstorm 
might wash nutrient-rich sediment

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:04.068
from a forest into a lake.

00:02:04.068 --> 00:02:09.224
These additional resources lead 
to a massive increase in algae growth

00:02:09.224 --> 00:02:12.604
known as eutrophication.

00:02:12.604 --> 00:02:15.454
But rather than providing 
more food and oxygen,

00:02:15.454 --> 00:02:19.707
this surge of growth 
has deadly consequences.

00:02:19.707 --> 00:02:25.578
As more algae grows on the surface, 
it blocks sunlight to the plants below.

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:30.158
These light-deprived plants 
die off and decompose

00:02:30.158 --> 00:02:35.953
in a process which uses up the water’s 
already depleted oxygen supply.

00:02:35.953 --> 00:02:39.613
Over time, this can reduce 
the oxygen content

00:02:39.613 --> 00:02:44.012
to less than 2 milligrams 
of oxygen per liter,

00:02:44.012 --> 00:02:47.572
creating an uninhabitable dead zone.

00:02:47.572 --> 00:02:53.392
There are rare bodies of water 
that rely on natural eutrophication.

00:02:53.392 --> 00:02:58.605
Regions like the Bay of Bengal 
are full of bottom-dwelling marine life

00:02:58.605 --> 00:03:02.605
that has adapted 
to low-oxygen conditions.

00:03:02.605 --> 00:03:09.806
But human activity has made eutrophication
a regular and widespread occurrence.

00:03:09.806 --> 00:03:15.980
Nutrient-rich waste from our sewage 
systems and industrial processes

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.607
often end up in lakes, estuaries 
and coastal waters.

00:03:20.607 --> 00:03:25.660
And the Gulf of Mexico is one 
of the largest dumping zones on earth

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.192
for one particular pollutant: fertilizer.

00:03:30.192 --> 00:03:33.164
American agriculture relies 
heavily on

00:03:33.164 --> 00:03:36.994
nitrogen and phosphate-based fertilizers.

00:03:36.994 --> 00:03:41.558
31 states, including America’s 
top agricultural producers,

00:03:41.558 --> 00:03:44.488
are connected 
to the Mississippi River Basin,

00:03:44.488 --> 00:03:49.582
and all of their runoff 
drains into the Gulf of Mexico.

00:03:49.582 --> 00:03:54.936
Farmers apply most of this fertilizer 
during the spring planting season,

00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:58.996
so the nutrient flood 
occurs shortly after.

00:03:58.996 --> 00:04:00.196
In the Gulf,

00:04:00.196 --> 00:04:06.893
decomposing algae sinks into the band
of cold saltwater near the seafloor.

00:04:06.893 --> 00:04:12.418
Since these dense lower waters don’t mix
with the warmer freshwater above,

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:15.748
it can take four months 
for tropical storms

00:04:15.748 --> 00:04:20.600
to fully circulate oxygenated water
back into the gulf.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.890
This dead zone currently costs 
U.S. seafood and tourism industries

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.390
as much as $82 million a year,

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.383
and that cost will only increase 
as the dead zone gets bigger.

00:04:34.383 --> 00:04:40.999
On average the gulf dead zone 
is roughly 15,000 square kilometers,

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:46.881
but in 2019 it grew 
to over 22,000 square kilometers—

00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:50.930
approximately the size of New Jersey.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:57.714
Human activity is similarly responsible 
for growing dead zones around the world.

00:04:57.714 --> 00:04:59.594
So what can be done?

00:04:59.594 --> 00:05:05.127
In the short term, countries can set 
tighter regulations on industrial run-off,

00:05:05.127 --> 00:05:10.117
and ban the dumping of untreated 
sewage into ocean waters.

00:05:10.117 --> 00:05:13.495
On farms, we can plant buffer zones

00:05:13.495 --> 00:05:17.750
composed of trees and shrubs 
to absorb runoff.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:24.697
However, long term solutions will require
radical changes to the way we grow food.

00:05:24.697 --> 00:05:28.567
Farmers are currently incentivized 
to use techniques

00:05:28.567 --> 00:05:30.938
that reduce the health of the soil

00:05:30.938 --> 00:05:34.828
and rely heavily 
on nitrogen-rich fertilizers.

00:05:34.828 --> 00:05:37.518
But there would be less need 
for these chemicals

00:05:37.518 --> 00:05:40.888
if we restore the soil’s natural nutrients

00:05:40.888 --> 00:05:46.754
by planting diverse crops that manage
soil erosion and fertility.

00:05:46.754 --> 00:05:51.201
Hopefully we can make 
these fundamental changes soon.

00:05:51.201 --> 00:05:53.011
Because if we don’t,

00:05:53.011 --> 00:05:58.431
the future of our marine ecosystems 
may be dead in the water.
