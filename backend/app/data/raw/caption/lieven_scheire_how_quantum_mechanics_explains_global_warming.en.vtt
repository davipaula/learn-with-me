00:00:06.687 --> 00:00:07.668
You've probably heard that

00:00:07.668 --> 00:00:10.452
carbon dioxide is warming the Earth,

00:00:10.452 --> 00:00:11.823
but how does it work?

00:00:11.823 --> 00:00:13.832
Is it like the glass of a greenhouse

00:00:13.832 --> 00:00:15.733
or like an insulating blanket?

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:17.852
Well, not entirely.

00:00:17.852 --> 00:00:19.272
The answer involves a bit

00:00:19.272 --> 00:00:22.010
of quantum mechanics, but don't worry,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.959
we'll start with a rainbow.

00:00:23.959 --> 00:00:25.818
If you look closely at sunlight separated

00:00:25.818 --> 00:00:27.134
through a prism,

00:00:27.134 --> 00:00:30.365
you'll see dark gaps where bands of color went missing.

00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:31.753
Where did they go?

00:00:31.753 --> 00:00:33.168
Before reaching our eyes,

00:00:33.168 --> 00:00:35.080
different gases absorbed those

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.688
specific parts of the spectrum.

00:00:37.688 --> 00:00:39.847
For example, oxygen gas snatched up

00:00:39.847 --> 00:00:41.695
some of the dark red light,

00:00:41.695 --> 00:00:44.914
and sodium grabbed two bands of yellow.

00:00:44.914 --> 00:00:46.308
But why do these gases absorb

00:00:46.308 --> 00:00:48.362
specific colors of light?

00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:51.279
This is where we enter the quantum realm.

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:53.637
Every atom and molecule has a set number

00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:56.968
of possible energy levels for its electrons.

00:00:56.968 --> 00:00:58.979
To shift its electrons from the ground state

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:00.297
to a higher level,

00:01:00.297 --> 00:01:03.701
a molecule needs to gain a certain amount of energy.

00:01:03.701 --> 00:01:06.119
No more, no less.

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.123
It gets that energy from light,

00:01:08.123 --> 00:01:11.292
which comes in more energy levels than you could count.

00:01:11.292 --> 00:01:14.657
Light consists of tiny particles called photons

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:16.761
and the amount of energy in each photon

00:01:16.761 --> 00:01:19.126
corresponds to its color.

00:01:19.126 --> 00:01:22.149
Red light has lower energy and longer wavelengths.

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.823
Purple light has higher energy and shorter wavelengths.

00:01:25.823 --> 00:01:28.642
Sunlight offers all the photons of the rainbow,

00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:30.663
so a gas molecule can choose

00:01:30.663 --> 00:01:33.270
the photons that carry the exact amount of energy

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.024
needed to shift the molecule to

00:01:35.024 --> 00:01:37.381
its next energy level.

00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:38.715
When this match is made,

00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:40.644
the photon disappers as the molecule

00:01:40.644 --> 00:01:41.965
gains its energy,

00:01:41.965 --> 00:01:44.765
and we get a small gap in our rainbow.

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:47.887
If a photon carries too much or too little energy,

00:01:47.887 --> 00:01:49.366
the molecule has no choice but

00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:51.219
to let it fly past.

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.639
This is why glass is transparent.

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:55.711
The atoms in glass do not pair well

00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:58.384
with any of the energy levels in visible light,

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:00.647
so the photons pass through.

00:02:00.647 --> 00:02:03.760
So, which photons does carbon dioxide prefer?

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.585
Where is the black line in our rainbow

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:07.960
that explains global warming?

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.789
Well, it's not there.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.952
Carbon dioxide doesn't absorb light directly

00:02:11.952 --> 00:02:13.286
from the Sun.

00:02:13.286 --> 00:02:14.507
It absorbs light from a totally

00:02:14.507 --> 00:02:16.232
different celestial body.

00:02:16.232 --> 00:02:19.016
One that doesn't appear to be emitting light at all:

00:02:19.016 --> 00:02:20.739
Earth.

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.175
If you're wondering why our planet

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:23.876
doesn't seem to be glowing,

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:27.138
it's because the Earth doesn't emit visible light.

00:02:27.138 --> 00:02:29.306
It emits infared light.

00:02:29.306 --> 00:02:30.920
The light that our eyes can see,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.992
including all of the colors of the rainbow,

00:02:32.992 --> 00:02:35.422
is just a small part of the larger spectrum

00:02:35.422 --> 00:02:37.825
of electromagnetic radiation,

00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:40.198
which includes radio waves, microwaves,

00:02:40.198 --> 00:02:43.286
infrared, ultraviolet, x-rays,

00:02:43.286 --> 00:02:45.103
and gamma rays.

00:02:45.103 --> 00:02:47.744
It may seem strange to think of these things as light,

00:02:47.744 --> 00:02:49.291
but there is no fundamental difference

00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:53.027
between visible light and other electromagnetic radiation.

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:54.127
It's the same energy,

00:02:54.127 --> 00:02:56.394
but at a higher or lower level.

00:02:56.394 --> 00:02:58.374
In fact, it's a bit presumptuous to define

00:02:58.374 --> 00:03:01.969
the term visible light by our own limitations.

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:04.865
After all, infrared light is visible to snakes,

00:03:04.865 --> 00:03:07.827
and ultraviolet light is visible to birds.

00:03:07.827 --> 00:03:09.907
If our eyes were adapted to see light of

00:03:09.907 --> 00:03:12.283
1900 megahertz, then a mobile phone

00:03:12.283 --> 00:03:13.423
would be a flashlight,

00:03:13.423 --> 00:03:14.425
and a cell phone tower

00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:17.157
would look like a huge lantern.

00:03:17.157 --> 00:03:19.315
Earth emits infrared radiation

00:03:19.315 --> 00:03:21.240
because every object with a temperature

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.468
above absolute zero will emit light.

00:03:24.468 --> 00:03:26.726
This is called thermal radiation.

00:03:26.726 --> 00:03:28.158
The hotter an object gets,

00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:30.857
the higher frequency the light it emits.

00:03:30.857 --> 00:03:32.561
When you heat a piece of iron,

00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:35.956
it will emit more and more frequencies of infrared light,

00:03:35.956 --> 00:03:40.322
and then, at a temperature of around 450 degrees Celsius,

00:03:40.322 --> 00:03:43.082
its light will reach the visible spectrum.

00:03:43.082 --> 00:03:45.310
At first, it will look red hot.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.606
And with even more heat,

00:03:46.606 --> 00:03:48.112
it will glow white

00:03:48.112 --> 00:03:51.166
with all of the frequencies of visible light.

00:03:51.166 --> 00:03:52.857
This is how traditional light bulbs

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:54.309
were designed to work

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:56.187
and why they're so wasteful.

00:03:56.187 --> 00:04:00.265
95% of the light they emit is invisible to our eyes.

00:04:00.265 --> 00:04:02.174
It's wasted as heat.

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:04.827
Earth's infrared radiation would escape to space

00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:07.358
if there weren't greenhouse gas molecules

00:04:07.358 --> 00:04:09.080
in our atmophere.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.834
Just as oxygen gas prefers the dark red photons,

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:14.512
carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases

00:04:14.512 --> 00:04:17.153
match with infrared photons.

00:04:17.153 --> 00:04:18.914
They provide the right amount of energy

00:04:18.914 --> 00:04:22.085
to shift the gas molecules into their higher energy level.

00:04:22.085 --> 00:04:24.410
Shortly after a carbon dioxide molecule

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.727
absorbs an infrared photon,

00:04:26.727 --> 00:04:29.182
it will fall back to its previous energy level,

00:04:29.182 --> 00:04:32.714
and spit a photon back out in a random direction.

00:04:32.714 --> 00:04:34.619
Some of that energy then returns

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:36.098
to Earth's surface,

00:04:36.098 --> 00:04:37.639
causing warming.

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.447
The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,

00:04:39.447 --> 00:04:41.380
the more likely that infrared photons

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.558
will land back on Earth

00:04:43.558 --> 00:04:45.124
and change our climate.
