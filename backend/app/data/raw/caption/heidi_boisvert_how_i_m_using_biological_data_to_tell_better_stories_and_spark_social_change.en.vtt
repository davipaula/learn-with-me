00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:17.000
For the past 15 years I've been trying
to change your mind.

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:21.768
In my work I harness pop culture
and emerging technology

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:23.250
to shift cultural norms.

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:27.518
I've made video games
to promote human rights,

00:00:27.542 --> 00:00:32.601
I've made animations to raise awareness
about unfair immigration laws

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:36.851
and I've even made location-based
augmented reality apps

00:00:36.875 --> 00:00:39.518
to change perceptions around homelessness

00:00:39.542 --> 00:00:41.476
well before PokÃ©mon Go.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.851
(Laughter)

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:46.893
But then I began to wonder
whether a game or an app

00:00:46.917 --> 00:00:49.393
can really change attitudes and behaviors,

00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:52.434
and if so, can I measure that change?

00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:55.434
What's the science behind that process?

00:00:55.458 --> 00:00:59.184
So I shifted my focus
from making media and technology

00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:02.250
to measuring their
neurobiological effects.

00:01:03.458 --> 00:01:05.309
Here's what I discovered.

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:09.226
The web, mobile devices,
virtual and augmented reality

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.934
were rescripting our nervous systems.

00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:14.917
And they were literally changing
the structure of our brain.

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:20.851
The very technologies I had been using
to positively influence hearts and minds

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:25.268
were actually eroding functions
in the brain necessary for empathy

00:01:25.292 --> 00:01:27.143
and decision-making.

00:01:27.167 --> 00:01:31.309
In fact, our dependence
upon the web and mobile devices

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:35.434
might be taking over
our cognitive and affective faculties,

00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:39.018
rendering us socially
and emotionally incompetent,

00:01:39.042 --> 00:01:42.333
and I felt complicit
in this dehumanization.

00:01:43.292 --> 00:01:47.934
I realized that before I could continue
making media about social issues,

00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:52.375
I needed to reverse engineer
the harmful effects of technology.

00:01:52.917 --> 00:01:55.684
To tackle this I asked myself,

00:01:55.708 --> 00:01:59.101
"How can I translate
the mechanisms of empathy,

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:02.768
the cognitive, affective
and motivational aspects,

00:02:02.792 --> 00:02:06.018
into an engine that simulates
the narrative ingredients

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:07.333
that move us to act?"

00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:12.518
To answer this, I had to build a machine.

00:02:12.542 --> 00:02:14.268
(Laughter)

00:02:14.292 --> 00:02:17.184
I've been developing
an open-source biometric lab,

00:02:17.208 --> 00:02:20.684
an AI system which I call the Limbic Lab.

00:02:20.708 --> 00:02:22.143
The lab not only captures

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:26.393
the brain and body's unconscious response
to media and technology

00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:29.393
but also uses machine learning
to adapt content

00:02:29.417 --> 00:02:31.625
based on these biological responses.

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:36.184
My goal is to find out what combination
of narrative ingredients

00:02:36.208 --> 00:02:38.351
are the most appealing and galvanizing

00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:40.184
to specific target audiences

00:02:40.208 --> 00:02:45.226
to enable social justice, cultural
and educational organizations

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.893
to create more effective media.

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:50.768
The Limbic Lab consists of two components:

00:02:50.792 --> 00:02:53.333
a narrative engine and a media machine.

00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:58.601
While a subject is viewing
or interacting with media content,

00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:02.809
the narrative engine takes in and syncs
real-time data from brain waves,

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:06.393
biophysical data like heart rate,
blood flow, body temperature

00:03:06.417 --> 00:03:08.101
and muscle contraction,

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:11.083
as well as eye-tracking
and facial expressions.

00:03:12.083 --> 00:03:15.809
Data is captured at key places
where critical plot points,

00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:19.250
character interaction
or unusual camera angles occur.

00:03:20.292 --> 00:03:23.018
Like the final scene
in "Game of Thrones, Red Wedding,"

00:03:23.042 --> 00:03:25.351
when shockingly,

00:03:25.375 --> 00:03:26.934
everybody dies.

00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:28.208
(Laughter)

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:32.226
Survey data on that
person's political beliefs,

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.393
along with their psychographic
and demographic data,

00:03:35.417 --> 00:03:37.184
are integrated into the system

00:03:37.208 --> 00:03:39.917
to gain a deeper understanding
of the individual.

00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:42.375
Let me give you an example.

00:03:43.708 --> 00:03:48.559
Matching people's TV preferences
with their views on social justice issues

00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:52.851
reveals that Americans who rank
immigration among their top three concerns

00:03:52.875 --> 00:03:55.667
are more likely to be fans
of "The Walking Dead,"

00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:59.768
and they often watch
for the adrenaline boost,

00:03:59.792 --> 00:04:01.083
which is measurable.

00:04:01.792 --> 00:04:05.726
A person's biological signature
and their survey response

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.601
combines into a database
to create their unique media imprint.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:14.893
Then our predictive model
finds patterns between media imprints

00:04:14.917 --> 00:04:16.893
and tells me which narrative ingredients

00:04:16.917 --> 00:04:20.684
are more likely to lead
to engagement in altruistic behavior

00:04:20.708 --> 00:04:23.393
rather than distress and apathy.

00:04:23.417 --> 00:04:25.601
The more imprints added to the database

00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:28.851
across mediums from episodic
television to games,

00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:31.042
the better the predictive models become.

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:36.268
In short, I am mapping
the first media genome.

00:04:36.292 --> 00:04:40.083
(Applause and cheers)

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:47.268
Whereas the human genome
identifies all genes involved

00:04:47.292 --> 00:04:49.125
in sequencing human DNA,

00:04:49.917 --> 00:04:53.143
the growing database of media imprints
will eventually allow me

00:04:53.167 --> 00:04:57.292
to determine the media DNA
for a specific person.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.083
Already the Limbic Lab's narrative engine

00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:04.934
helps content creators
refine their storytelling,

00:05:04.958 --> 00:05:08.958
so that it resonates with their target
audiences on an individual level.

00:05:11.042 --> 00:05:13.226
The Limbic Lab's other component,

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.226
the media machine,

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.726
will assess how media elicits
an emotional and physiological response,

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.184
then pulls scenes from a content library

00:05:22.208 --> 00:05:24.792
targeted to person-specific media DNA.

00:05:26.042 --> 00:05:29.934
Applying artificial intelligence
to biometric data

00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.684
creates a truly personalized experience.

00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:37.792
One that adapts content based
on real-time unconscious responses.

00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:44.684
Imagine if nonprofits and media makers
were able to measure how audiences feel

00:05:44.708 --> 00:05:46.559
as they experience it

00:05:46.583 --> 00:05:48.976
and alter content on the fly.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.458
I believe this is the future of media.

00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:55.934
To date, most media
and social-change strategies

00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.809
have attempted to appeal
to mass audiences,

00:05:58.833 --> 00:06:02.333
but the future is media
customized for each person.

00:06:03.458 --> 00:06:06.143
As real-time measurement
of media consumption

00:06:06.167 --> 00:06:09.018
and automated media production
becomes the norm,

00:06:09.042 --> 00:06:13.101
we will soon be consuming media
tailored directly to our cravings

00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:17.333
using a blend of psychographics,
biometrics and AI.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.809
It's like personalized medicine
based on our DNA.

00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:24.000
I call it "biomedia."

00:06:25.042 --> 00:06:28.309
I am currently testing
the Limbic Lab in a pilot study

00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:30.351
with the Norman Lear Center,

00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:34.101
which looks at the top 50
episodic television shows.

00:06:34.125 --> 00:06:37.143
But I am grappling
with an ethical dilemma.

00:06:37.167 --> 00:06:41.018
If I design a tool
that can be turned into a weapon,

00:06:41.042 --> 00:06:42.333
should I build it?

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.393
By open-sourcing the lab
to encourage access and inclusivity,

00:06:47.417 --> 00:06:50.851
I also run the risk
of enabling powerful governments

00:06:50.875 --> 00:06:53.809
and profit-driven companies
to appropriate the platform

00:06:53.833 --> 00:06:57.917
for fake news, marketing
or other forms of mass persuasion.

00:06:59.375 --> 00:07:02.726
For me, therefore,
it is critical to make my research

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.333
as transparent to
lay audiences as GMO labels.

00:07:07.333 --> 00:07:09.875
However, this is not enough.

00:07:11.208 --> 00:07:12.851
As creative technologists,

00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:15.101
we have a responsibility

00:07:15.125 --> 00:07:19.893
not only to reflect upon how present
technology shapes our cultural values

00:07:19.917 --> 00:07:21.934
and social behavior,

00:07:21.958 --> 00:07:26.893
but also to actively challenge
the trajectory of future technology.

00:07:26.917 --> 00:07:30.976
It is my hope that we make
an ethical commitment

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.351
to harvesting the body's intelligence

00:07:33.375 --> 00:07:36.809
for the creation of authentic
and just stories

00:07:36.833 --> 00:07:39.226
that transform media and technology

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.726
from harmful weapons
into narrative medicine.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.018
Thank you.

00:07:44.042 --> 00:07:46.250
(Applause and cheers)
