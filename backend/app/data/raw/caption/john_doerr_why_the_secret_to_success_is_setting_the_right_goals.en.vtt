00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.800
We're at a critical moment.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.856
Our leaders,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.936
some of our great institutions

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.160
are failing us.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.440
Why?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.536
In some cases, it's because they're bad

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.760
or unethical,

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.440
but often, they've taken us
to the wrong objectives.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.720
And this is unacceptable.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.680
This has to stop.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.200
How are we going to correct these wrongs?

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.560
How are we going
to choose the right course?

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.640
It's not going to be easy.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.880
For years, I've worked with talented teams

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.736
and they've chosen the right objectives
and the wrong objectives.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.376
Many have succeeded,
others of them have failed.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.616
And today I'm going to share with you

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.936
what really makes a difference --

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.376
that's what's crucial,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.936
how and why

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.496
they set meaningful and audacious goals,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.160
the right goals for the right reasons.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.896
Let's go back to 1975.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.536
Yep, this is me.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.896
I've got a lot to learn,
I'm a computer engineer,

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.176
I've got long hair,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.120
but I'm working under Andy Grove,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.496
who's been called the greatest manager
of his or any other era.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.496
Andy was a superb leader
and also a teacher,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.840
and he said to me, "John,
it almost doesn't matter what you know.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.776
Execution is what matters the most."

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.536
And so Andy invented a system
called "Objectives and Key Results."

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.640
It kind of rolls off
the tongue, doesn't it?

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.216
And it's all about excellent execution.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.216
So here's a classic video from the 1970s

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.776
of professor Andy Grove.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.496
(Video) Andy Grove: The two key phrases
of the management by objective systems

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.296
are the objectives and the key results,
and they match the two purposes.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.536
The objective is the direction.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.296
The key results have to be measured,

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.016
but at the end you can look
and without any argument say,

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.816
"Did I do that, or did I not do that?"
Yes. No. Simple.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.256
John Doerr: That's Andy.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.320
Yes. No. Simple.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.735
Objectives and Key Results,

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.896
or OKRs,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.416
are a simple goal-setting system

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.336
and they work for organizations,
they work for teams,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.040
they even work for individuals.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.776
The objectives are what
you want to have accomplished.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.936
The key results are how
I'm going to get that done.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.256
Objectives. Key results.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.960
What and how.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.440
But here's the truth:

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.576
many of us are setting goals wrong,

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.760
and most of us
are not setting goals at all.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.096
A lot of organizations
set objectives and meet them.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.136
They ship their sales,
they introduce their new products,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.656
they make their numbers,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.160
but they lack a sense of purpose
to inspire their teams.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.840
So how do you set
these goals the right way?

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.080
First, you must answer
the question, "Why?"

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.096
Why?

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.856
Because truly transformational teams

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.056
combine their ambitions
to their passion and to their purpose,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.880
and they develop a clear
and compelling sense of why.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.566
I want to tell you a story.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.496
I work with a remarkable entrepreneur.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.000
Her name is Jini Kim.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.400
She runs a company called Nuna.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.680
Nuna is a health care data company.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.616
And when Nuna was founded,

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.320
they used data to serve the health needs
of lots of workers at large companies.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.416
And then two years
into the company's life,

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.016
the federal government issued a proposal

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.200
to build the first ever
cloud database for Medicaid.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.536
Now, you'll remember
that Medicaid is that program

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.016
that serves 70 million Americans,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.680
our poor, our children

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.120
and people with disabilities.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.216
Nuna at the time was just 15 people

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.896
and this database
had to be built in one year,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.536
and they had a whole set of commitments
that they had to honor,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.920
and frankly, they weren't going to make
very much money on the project.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.976
This was a bet-your-company moment,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.416
and Jini seized it.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.360
She jumped at the opportunity.
She did not flinch.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.000
Why?

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.696
Well, it's a personal why.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.720
Jini's younger brother Kimong has autism.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.296
And when he was seven,

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.576
he had his first grand mal seizure

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.816
at Disneyland.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.296
He fell to the ground.
He stopped breathing.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.016
Jini's parents are Korean immigrants.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.416
They came to the country
with limited resources

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.296
speaking little English,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.320
so it was up to Jini
to enroll her family in Medicaid.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.800
She was nine years old.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.376
That moment defined her mission,

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.096
and that mission became her company,

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.360
and that company bid on, won
and delivered on that contract.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.816
Here's Jini to tell you why.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.656
(Video) Jini Kim: Medicaid
saved my family from bankruptcy,

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.200
and today it provides for Kimong's health
and for millions of others.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.376
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.216
Every row of data is a life

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.480
whose story deserves
to be told with dignity.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.696
JD: And Jini's story tells us

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.696
that a compelling sense of why
can be the launchpad for our objectives.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.896
Remember, that's what
we want to have accomplished.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.536
And objectives are significant,

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.456
they're action-oriented,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.440
they are inspiring,

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.960
and they're a kind of vaccine
against fuzzy thinking.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.056
You think a rockstar

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.616
would be an unlikely user
of Objectives and Key Results,

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.456
but for years, Bono has used OKRs

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.776
to wage a global war
against poverty and disease,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.016
and his ONE organization
has focused on two really gorgeous,

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.856
audacious objectives.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.176
The first is debt relief

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.200
for the poorest countries in the world.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.896
The next is universal access
to anti-HIV drugs.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.896
Now, why are these good objectives?

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.936
Let's go back to our checklist.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.336
Significant? Check. Concrete? Yes.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.176
Action-oriented? Yes.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.400
Inspirational?

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.880
Well, let's just listen to Bono.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.216
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate?

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.456
How passionate?

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.920
What actions does your passion
lead you to do?

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.656
If the heart doesn't find
a perfect rhyme with the head,

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.896
then your passion means nothing.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.456
The OKR framework cultivates the madness,

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.856
the chemistry contained inside it.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.016
It gives us an environment for risk,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.256
for trust,

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.656
where failing is not a fireable offense.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.300
And when you have that sort
of structure and environment

00:06:54.324 --> 00:06:56.056
and the right people,

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.770
magic is around the corner.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.096
JD: I love that.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.496
OKRs cultivate the madness,

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.256
and magic is right around the corner.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.480
This is perfect.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.056
So with Jini we've covered the whys,

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.896
with Bono the whats of goal-setting.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.456
Let's turn our attention to the hows.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.696
Remember, the hows are the key results.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.056
That's how we meet our objectives.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.656
And good results
are specific and time-bound.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.656
They're aggressive but realistic.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.736
They're measurable,
and they're verifiable.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.320
Those are good key results.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.256
In 1999, I introduced OKRs
to Google's cofounders,

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.536
Larry and Sergey.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.896
Here they are,
24 years old in their garage.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.360
And Sergey enthusiastically
said he'd adopt them.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.480
Well, not quite.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.896
What he really said was,

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.376
"We don't have any other way
to manage this company,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.656
so we'll give it a go."

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.896
(Laughter)

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.280
And I took that as a kind of endorsement.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.656
But every quarter since then,

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.120
every Googler has written down
her objectives and her key results.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.256
They've graded them,

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.480
and they've published them
for everyone to see.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.376
And these are not used
for bonuses or for promotions.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.696
They're set aside.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.456
They're used for a higher purpose,

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.576
and that's to get collective commitment

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.080
to truly stretch goals.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.456
In 2008, a Googler, Sundar Pichai,
took on an objective

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.776
which was to build
the next generation client platform

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.640
for the future of web applications --

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.320
in other words, build the best browser.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.360
He was very thoughtful
about how he chose his key results.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.656
How do you measure the best browser?

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.776
It could be ad clicks or engagement.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.456
No. He said: numbers of users,

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.535
because users are going to decide

00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:51.976
if Chrome is a great browser or not.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.576
So he had this one
three-year-long objective:

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.856
build the best browser.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.856
And then every year
he stuck to the same key results,

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.816
numbers of users, but he upped the ante.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.096
In the first year,
his goal was 20 million users

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.656
and he missed it.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.936
He got less than 10.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.776
Second year, he raised
the bar to 50 million.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.936
He got to 37 million users.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.200
Somewhat better.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.000
In the third year,

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.936
he upped the ante once more
to a hundred million.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.416
He launched an aggressive
marketing campaign,

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.896
broader distribution,
improved the technology, and kaboom!

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.360
He got 111 million users.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.456
Here's why I like this story,

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.296
not so much for the happy ending,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.336
but it shows someone
carefully choosing the right objective

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.480
and then sticking to it
year after year after year.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.320
It's a perfect story for a nerd like me.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.816
Now, I think of OKRs
as transparent vessels

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.840
that are made from the whats
and hows of our ambitions.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:58.176
What really matters is the why
that we pour into those vessels.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.840
That's why we do our work.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.240
OKRs are not a silver bullet.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.016
They're not going to be
a substitute for a strong culture

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.936
or for stronger leadership,

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.680
but when those fundamentals are in place,
they can take you to the mountaintop.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.480
I want you to think
about your life for a moment.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.120
Do you have the right metrics?

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.576
Take time to write down your values,

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.640
your objectives and your key results.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.400
Do it today.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.096
If you'd like some feedback on them,
you can send them to me.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.360
I'm john@whatmatters.com.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.856
If we think of the world-changing goals

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.096
of an Intel, of a Nuna, of Bono,

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.816
of Google,

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.096
they're remarkable:

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.976
ubiquitous computing,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.576
affordable health care,
high-quality for everyone,

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.256
ending global poverty,

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.200
access to all the world's information.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.336
Here's the deal:

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.800
every one of those goals
is powered today by OKRs.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.216
Now, I've been called
the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.536
for spreading the good gospel
according to Andy Grove,

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.136
but I want you
to join me in this movement.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.736
Let's fight for what it is
that really matters,

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.256
because we can take OKRs
beyond our businesses.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:21.216
We can take them to our families,

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.496
to our schools,

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.920
even to our governments.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.896
We can hold those governments accountable.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.635
We can transform those informations.

00:11:28.659 --> 00:11:31.739
We can get back on the right track

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:41.400
if we can and do measure
what really matters.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.496
Thank you.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.400
(Applause)
