00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.088
So here's a thought.

00:00:14.112 --> 00:00:19.031
The fossil fuel industry
knows how to stop causing global warming,

00:00:19.055 --> 00:00:21.556
but they're waiting
for somebody else to pay,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.661
and no one is calling them out on it.

00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:27.606
I was one of the authors
of the 2018 IPCC report

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.940
on 1.5 degrees Celsius.

00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:32.026
And after the report was published,

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.584
I gave a lot of talks, including one
to a meeting of young engineers

00:00:35.608 --> 00:00:38.670
of one of the world's major
oil and gas companies.

00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:42.356
And at the end of the talk,
I got the inevitable question,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.021
"Do you personally believe
there's any chance

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:48.044
of us limiting global
warming to 1.5 degrees?"

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:51.236
IPCC reports are not really
about personal opinions,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.836
so I turned the question around and said,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.489
"Well, if you had to fully
decarbonize your product,

00:00:58.513 --> 00:01:04.234
that is, dispose safely and permanently
of one ton of carbon dioxide

00:01:04.258 --> 00:01:08.001
for every ton generated
by the oil and gas you sell,

00:01:08.025 --> 00:01:10.506
by 2050, which is what it would take,

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.650
would you be able to do so?"

00:01:13.092 --> 00:01:16.276
"Would the same rules
apply to everybody?" somebody asked,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.510
meaning, of course, their competition.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.186
I said, "OK, yeah, maybe they would."

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.659
Now, the management
just looked at their shoes;

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:25.806
they didn't want to answer the question.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.041
But the young engineers
just shrugged and said,

00:01:28.065 --> 00:01:30.795
"Yes, of course we would,
like it's even a question."

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.726
So I want to talk to you

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.976
about what those young
engineers know how to do:

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.380
decarbonize fossil fuels.

00:01:38.738 --> 00:01:41.016
Not decarbonize the economy,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.616
or even decarbonize their own company,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.895
but decarbonize the fuels themselves,

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:48.125
and this matters

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.113
because it turns out to be essential
to stopping global warming.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.526
At a global level, climate change
turns out to be surprisingly simple:

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.752
To stop global warming

00:01:57.776 --> 00:02:00.998
we need to stop dumping carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere.

00:02:01.022 --> 00:02:05.026
And since about 85 percent
of the carbon dioxide we currently emit

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.966
comes from fossil fuels and industry,

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.220
we need to stop fossil fuels
from causing further global warming.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.068
So how do we do that?

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.610
Well, it turns out
there's really only two options.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.630
The first option is,
in effect, to ban fossil fuels.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.696
That's what "absolute zero" means.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.406
No one allowed to extract,
sell, or use fossil fuels

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.083
anywhere in the world
on pain of a massive fine.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.361
If that sounds unlikely,
it's because it is.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.126
And even if a global ban were possible,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.603
do you or I in wealthy countries in 2020

00:02:44.627 --> 00:02:46.786
have any right to tell the citizens

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.376
of poor and emerging
economies in the 2060s

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.531
not to touch their fossil fuels?

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.166
Some people argue
that if we work hard enough

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.143
we can drive down the cost
of renewable energy so far

00:03:00.167 --> 00:03:03.046
that we won't need to ban fossil fuels,

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.303
the people will stop using them
of their own accord.

00:03:06.864 --> 00:03:09.816
This kind of thinking
is dangerously optimistic.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.841
For one thing, renewable energy costs
might not go down as fast as they hope.

00:03:13.865 --> 00:03:15.022
I mean, remember,

00:03:15.046 --> 00:03:19.606
nuclear energy was meant to be
too cheap to meter in the 1970s,

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.846
but even more importantly,

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.166
we've no idea how low
fossil fuel prices might fall

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.473
in response to that competition.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.606
There are so many uses of fossil carbon,

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.426
from aviation fuel to cement production,

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.086
it's not enough for carbon-free
alternatives to outcompete the big ones,

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.611
to stop fossil fuels
from causing further global warming,

00:03:43.635 --> 00:03:47.174
carbon-free alternatives
would need to outcompete them all.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.736
So the only real alternative to stop
fossil fuels causing global warming

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.006
is to decarbonize them.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.296
I know that sounds odd,

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.036
decarbonize fossil fuels.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.526
What it means is,

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.189
one ton of carbon dioxide has to be safely
and permanently disposed of

00:04:05.213 --> 00:04:10.296
for every ton generated
by the continued use of fossil fuels.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.196
Now, consumers can't do this,

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.146
so the responsibility
has to lie with the companies

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.492
that are producing and selling
the fossil fuels themselves.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.986
Their engineers know how to do it.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.954
In fact, they've known for decades.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.556
The simplest option is to capture
the carbon dioxide as it's generated

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.810
from the chimney of a power station,
or blast furnace, or refinery.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.606
You purify it, compress it,
and re-inject it back underground.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.716
If you inject it deep enough
and into the right rock formations,

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.213
it stays there, just like
the hydrocarbons it came from.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.526
To stop further global warming,

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.316
permanent storage has to mean
tens of thousands of years at least,

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.783
which is why trying to mop up
our fossil carbon emissions

00:04:58.807 --> 00:05:01.786
by planting trees can help,

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.503
but it can only be a temporary stopgap.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.306
For some applications
like aviation fuel, for example,

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.036
we can't capture
the carbon dioxide at source,

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.963
so we have to recapture it,
take it back out of the atmosphere.

00:05:16.501 --> 00:05:19.017
That can be done;
there's companies already doing it,

00:05:19.041 --> 00:05:20.594
but it's more expensive.

00:05:20.618 --> 00:05:23.646
And this points to the single
most important reason

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.926
why recapturing and safe disposal
of carbon dioxide

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:30.366
is not already standard practice:

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.586
cost.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.616
It's infinitely cheaper just to dump
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.786
than it is to capture it
and dispose of it safely back underground.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.176
But the good news is,

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.793
we don't need to dispose of 100 percent

00:05:45.817 --> 00:05:49.829
of the carbon dioxide we generate
from burning fossil fuels right away.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.656
Economists talk about
cost-effective pathways,

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.436
by which they mean
ways of achieving a result

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.725
without unfairly dumping
too much of the cost

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:00.469
onto the next generation.

00:06:01.042 --> 00:06:02.936
And a cost-effective pathway,

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.206
which gets us to
decarbonizing fossil fuels,

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.256
100 percent carbon capture
and storage by 2050,

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.160
which is what net-zero means,

00:06:13.184 --> 00:06:18.006
takes us through 10 percent
carbon capture in 2030,

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.819
50 percent in 2040,

00:06:19.843 --> 00:06:22.153
100 percent in 2050.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.176
To put that in context,

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.643
we are currently capturing
and storing less than 0.1 percent.

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:30.746
So don't get me wrong,

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.010
decarbonizing fossil fuels
is not going to be easy.

00:06:34.374 --> 00:06:38.986
It's going to mean building
a carbon dioxide disposal industry

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.843
comparable in size
to today's oil and gas industry.

00:06:43.405 --> 00:06:45.826
The only entities in the world

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.534
that have the engineering capability

00:06:48.558 --> 00:06:51.296
and the deep pockets to do this

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.410
are the companies that produce
the fossil fuels themselves.

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:00.596
We can all help by slowing
down our use of fossil carbon

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.566
to buy them time to decarbonize it,

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.666
but they still have to get on with it.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.371
Now, adding the cost
of carbon dioxide disposal

00:07:08.395 --> 00:07:11.466
will make fossil fuel-based
products more expensive,

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.186
and a 10 percent storage requirement
by 2030, for example,

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.486
might add a few pence
to the cost of a liter of petrol.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.136
But, unlike a tax,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.713
that money is clearly being spent
on solving the problem,

00:07:26.453 --> 00:07:28.386
and of course, consumers will respond,

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.036
perhaps by switching
to electric cars, for example,

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.616
but they won't need to be told to do so.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:39.569
And crucially, if developing countries
agreed to use fossil fuels

00:07:39.593 --> 00:07:43.086
that have been progressively
decarbonized in this way,

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:48.333
then they never need accept limits
on the absolute amount that they consume,

00:07:48.357 --> 00:07:51.713
which they fear
might constrain their growth.

00:07:52.141 --> 00:07:53.716
Over the past couple of years,

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.596
more and more people have been talking

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.268
about the importance
of carbon dioxide disposal.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.515
But they're still talking about it

00:08:00.539 --> 00:08:05.147
as if it's to be paid for
by philanthropy or tax breaks.

00:08:05.577 --> 00:08:09.806
But why should foundations
or the taxpayer pay to clean up

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.307
after a still-profitable industry?

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.241
No. We can decarbonize fossil fuels.

00:08:16.601 --> 00:08:19.136
And if we do decarbonize fossil fuels,

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.166
as well as getting things like
deforestation under control,

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.296
we will stop global warming.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.723
And if we don't, we won't.

00:08:25.747 --> 00:08:27.866
It's as simple as that.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.667
But it's going to take a movement
to make this happen.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.616
So how can you help?

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.550
Well, it depends on who you are.

00:08:34.962 --> 00:08:39.306
If you work or invest
in the fossil fuel industry,

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:44.286
don't walk away from the problem
by selling off your fossil fuel assets

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:47.036
to someone else
who cares less than you do.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.676
You own this problem.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.183
You need to fix it.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:55.256
Decarbonizing your portfolio
helps no one but your conscience.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.538
You must decarbonize your product.

00:08:59.938 --> 00:09:02.116
If you're a politician or a civil servant,

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.318
you need to look at your favorite
climate policy and ask:

00:09:05.342 --> 00:09:08.696
How is it helping
to decarbonize fossil fuels?

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.416
How is it helping to increase the fraction

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.266
of carbon dioxide
we generate from fossil fuels

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:17.556
that is safely and
permanently disposed of?

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:22.217
If it isn't, then it may be
helping to slow global warming,

00:09:22.241 --> 00:09:24.224
which is useful,

00:09:24.248 --> 00:09:28.360
but unless you believe in that ban,
it isn't going to stop it.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:31.586
Finally, if you're an environmentalist,

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.916
you probably find the idea
of the fossil fuel industry itself

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:41.316
playing such a central role in solving
the climate change problem disturbing.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.126
"Won't those carbon
dioxide reservoirs leak?"

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.352
you'll worry,

00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:47.849
"Or won't some in the industry cheat?"

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.771
Over the coming decades,
there probably will be leaks,

00:09:52.795 --> 00:09:54.466
and there may be cheats,

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.746
but those leaks and those cheats

00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:00.070
will make decarbonizing
fossil fuels harder,

00:10:00.094 --> 00:10:02.726
they don't make it optional.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:08.206
Global warming won't wait
for the fossil fuel industry to die.

00:10:08.556 --> 00:10:10.746
And just calling for it to die

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:15.383
is letting it off the hook
from solving its own problem.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.486
In these divided times,
we need to look for help

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:24.013
and maybe even friends
in unexpected places.

00:10:24.406 --> 00:10:27.146
It's time to call on
the fossil fuel industry

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.520
to help solve the problem
their product has created.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:32.866
Their engineers know how,

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:36.970
