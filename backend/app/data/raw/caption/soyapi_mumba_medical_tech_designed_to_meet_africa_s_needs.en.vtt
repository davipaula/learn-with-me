00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.216
Like every passionate
software engineer out there,

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.576
I closely follow technology
companies in Silicon Valley,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.720
pretty much the same way soccer fans
follow their teams in Europe.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.856
I read articles on tech blogs

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.000
and listen to podcasts on my phone.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.896
But after I finish the article,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.256
lock my phone and unplug the headphones,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.496
I'm back in sub-Saharan Africa,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.960
where the landscape is not quite the same.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.800
We have long and frequent power outages,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.776
low penetration of computers,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.736
slow internet connections

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.016
and a lot of patients
visiting understaffed hospitals.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.176
Since the HIV epidemic,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.856
hospitals have been struggling
to manage regular HIV treatment records

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.720
for increasing volumes of patients.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.456
For such environments,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.376
importing technology systems
developed elsewhere has not worked,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.616
but in 2006, I joined Baobab Health,

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.176
a team that uses locally based engineers

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.816
to develop suitable interventions

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.696
that are addressing
health care challenges in Malawi.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.136
We designed an electronic
health record system

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.496
that is used by health care workers
while seeing patients.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.096
And in the process we realized that we
not only had to design the software,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.480
we had to implement
the infrastructure as well.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.856
We don't have enough medical staff

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.736
to comprehensively examine every patient,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.816
so we embedded clinical guidelines
within the software

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.016
to guide nurses and clerks

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.200
who assist with handling
some of the workload.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.656
Everyone has a birthday,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.176
but not everyone knows their birthday,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.016
so we wrote algorithms
to handle estimated birthdates

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.320
as complete dates.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.136
How do we follow up
patients living in slums

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.360
with no street and house numbers?

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.080
We used landmarks to approximate
their physical addresses.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.480
Malawi had no IDs
to uniquely identify patients,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.616
so we had to implement unique patient IDs

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.880
to link patient records across clinics.

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:25.360
The IDs are printed as barcodes

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.056
on labels that are stuck
on personal health booklets

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.280
kept by each patient.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.976
With this barcoded ID,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.416
a simple scan with a barcode reader

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.680
quickly pulls up the patient's records.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.736
No need to rewrite their personal details

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.176
on paper registers at every visit.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.856
And suddenly, queues became shorter.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.776
This meant patients, typically mothers
with little children on their backs,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.936
had to spend less time
waiting to be assisted.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.896
And if they lose their booklets,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.096
their records can still be pulled
by searching with their names.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.840
Now, the way we pronounce
and spell names varies tremendously.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.640
We freely mix R's and L's,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.920
English and vernacular
versions of their names.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.096
Even soundex,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.536
a standard method for grouping words
by how similar they sound,

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.136
was not good enough.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.856
So we had to modify it

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.680
to help us link and match
existing records.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.360
Before the iPhone,

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.856
software engineers
developed for personal computers,

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.136
but from our experience,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.536
we knew our power system
is not reliable enough

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.840
for personal computers.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.136
So we repurposed touch screen
point-of-sale terminals

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.856
that are meant for retail shops

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.640
to become clinical workstations.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.080
At the time, we imported
internet appliances called i-Openers

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.976
that were manufactured
during the dot-com era

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.840
by a failed US company.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.376
We modified their screens

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.776
to add touch sensors

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.120
and their power system
to run from rechargeable batteries.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.816
When we started, we didn't find
a reliable network to transmit data,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.480
especially from rural hospitals.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.960
So we built our own towers,

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.616
created a wireless network

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.056
and linked clinics in Lilongwe,

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.280
Malawi's capital.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.480
(Applause)

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.200
With a team of engineers

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.496
working within a hospital campus,

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.176
we observed health care workers
use the system

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.416
and iteratively
build an information system

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.256
that is now managing HIV records

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.896
in all major public hospitals in Malawi.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.120
These are hospitals serving
over 2,000 HIV patients, each clinic.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.536
Now, health care workers
who used to spend days

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.696
to tally and prepare quarterly reports

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.960
are producing the same reports
within minutes,

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.816
and health care experts
from all over the world

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.880
are now coming to Malawi
to learn how we did it.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.336
(Applause)

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.936
It is inspiring and fun

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.776
to follow technology trends
across the globe,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.896
but to make them work

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.096
in low-resourced environments

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.296
like public hospitals
in sub-Saharan Africa,

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.096
we have had to become jacks-of-all-trades

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.656
and build whole systems,
including the infrastructure,

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.920
from the ground up.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.776
Thank you.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.800
(Applause)
