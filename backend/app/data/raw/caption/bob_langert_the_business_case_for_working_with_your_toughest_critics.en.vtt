00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.643
Who remembers this
infamous Styrofoam container?

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:20.226
(Applause)

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.559
Well, it sure changed me,
it changed my company,

00:00:23.583 --> 00:00:25.518
and it started a revelatory journey

00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:29.768
about how adversaries
can be your best allies.

00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:31.351
You know, back in the late '80s,

00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:36.518
this Big Mac clamshell
was the symbol of a garbage crisis.

00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:38.518
People were really angry.

00:00:38.542 --> 00:00:40.768
For example, thousands of students,

00:00:40.792 --> 00:00:44.559
young students around the globe
were sending letters, blaming McDonald's,

00:00:44.583 --> 00:00:48.434
because we were using
millions of these at that time.

00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:52.518
Now, no one at McDonald's knew anything
about environmentally friendly packaging,

00:00:52.542 --> 00:00:54.018
including me.

00:00:54.042 --> 00:00:55.309
The last 10 years,

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:58.351
I was in charge of logistics
and truck drivers.

00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:00.351
Then out of nowhere, my boss comes to me

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:05.601
and says, "Hey, we want you
to save this clamshell for the company

00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:08.917
and lead the effort to reduce waste
within McDonald's."

00:01:10.167 --> 00:01:12.226
I looked at him and I asked him,

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.708
"What is polystyrene?"

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:18.018
But it all sounded intriguing to me

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:20.792
because it brought me back to my roots.

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:28.809
You see, I grew up
in the late '60s, early '70s,

00:01:28.833 --> 00:01:32.500
in a time of huge social upheaval
in the United States.

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:36.434
And I was really in tune
with the protests, the sit-ins,

00:01:36.458 --> 00:01:38.184
the anti-Vietnam sentiment,

00:01:38.208 --> 00:01:41.875
and I really felt there was a need
to question authority.

00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.476
But as I went into university,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.726
I realized that I'm not
going to make a living doing this.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.268
And that whole movement had subsided,

00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:55.684
and my activist spirit went dormant.

00:01:55.708 --> 00:01:57.184
And I needed to make a living,

00:01:57.208 --> 00:01:59.167
so I got involved in the business world.

00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:02.643
So, now these students against pollution,

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:05.893
who were sending those
protest letters to McDonald's,

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:09.976
they reminded me of myself 20 years ago.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.018
They're questioning authority.

00:02:12.042 --> 00:02:14.518
But now, I'm the man.

00:02:14.542 --> 00:02:16.393
(Laughter)

00:02:16.417 --> 00:02:17.958
I'm the corporate suit.

00:02:19.042 --> 00:02:21.375
I'm the one representing authority.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.059
And this new thing was emerging

00:02:24.083 --> 00:02:26.434
called corporate social responsibility,

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:28.934
later corporate sustainability,

00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:31.958
and now I had a chance
to make a difference.

00:02:33.042 --> 00:02:34.976
So the beginning of this journey

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.434
started when McDonald's agreed
to a partnership

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.768
with the Environmental Defense Fund.

00:02:40.792 --> 00:02:42.309
They were an NGO

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:46.750
that was founded with the principle
of "sue the bastards."

00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:49.601
So I'm thinking,

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:52.434
what are they thinking
about me and my team?

00:02:52.458 --> 00:02:54.934
When I first met Richard Denison,

00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.351
he's the senior scientist for EDF,

00:02:58.375 --> 00:03:00.143
I was very apprehensive.

00:03:00.167 --> 00:03:02.059
I thought he's a tree-hugger,

00:03:02.083 --> 00:03:05.434
and I'm thinking he thinks
all I care about is the money.

00:03:05.458 --> 00:03:10.851
So we wanted the EDF team
to give us real-world solutions.

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:12.750
So we did the logical thing.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.143
We had them flip burgers
in our restaurants.

00:03:17.167 --> 00:03:19.184
So you have to imagine Richard,

00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:22.018
who, by the way, is a PhD in physics,

00:03:22.042 --> 00:03:24.809
and there he is, he's trying
to dress a quarter-pounder,

00:03:24.833 --> 00:03:27.851
and you're supposed to have
two squirts of ketchup, one mustard,

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:30.268
three pickles and an onion,
go on to the next one,

00:03:30.292 --> 00:03:31.559
you've got to be so fast.

00:03:31.583 --> 00:03:34.309
And you know what?
He couldn't get it right all day long.

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:35.934
And he was frustrated.

00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:38.851
And I was so impressed,

00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:42.625
because he was trying
to understand our business.

00:03:43.583 --> 00:03:44.851
Now, the EDF team,

00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:49.768
they thought reusables
were the holy grail for our business.

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:52.768
Me and my team thought, reusables?

00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:54.601
Too much space, they'd make a mess,

00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:56.434
they would slow us down.

00:03:56.458 --> 00:03:58.434
But we didn't reject the idea.

00:03:58.458 --> 00:04:03.601
We went to the restaurant they chose
outside DC, we went to the back room.

00:04:03.625 --> 00:04:05.559
The dishwasher wasn't working properly,

00:04:05.583 --> 00:04:07.393
it's spitting out dirty dishes.

00:04:07.417 --> 00:04:10.143
The kitchen area is dirty and grimy.

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:12.351
And compared to their
experience at McDonald's

00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:13.726
that's clean and organized,

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.518
they could see the stark difference.

00:04:16.542 --> 00:04:19.518
We also sat in a restaurant
at McDonald's, all day long,

00:04:19.542 --> 00:04:22.518
and watched the customers eating in.

00:04:22.542 --> 00:04:23.976
Their behavior.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.684
Ends up that many customers
left with the food,

00:04:26.708 --> 00:04:28.393
they left with the beverage.

00:04:28.417 --> 00:04:31.268
And EDF came to their own conclusion

00:04:31.292 --> 00:04:34.184
that reusables wouldn't work for us.

00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:37.768
But they did have
a lot of ideas that did work.

00:04:37.792 --> 00:04:40.768
And we never would have thought
of them by ourselves,

00:04:40.792 --> 00:04:42.684
without the EDF team.

00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:46.934
My favorite was switching
from the white carry-out bag

00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:48.583
to the brown bag.

00:04:54.292 --> 00:04:57.226
We had been using the white bag.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.184
It's virgin material,

00:04:59.208 --> 00:05:02.559
it's made from chlorine
bleaching chemicals,

00:05:02.583 --> 00:05:05.101
and they said, use an unbleached bag,

00:05:05.125 --> 00:05:06.500
no chemicals.

00:05:07.667 --> 00:05:09.476
It's made from recycled content,

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.101
mostly recycled shipping corrugated boxes.

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:15.768
Ends up that the bag is stronger,
the fiber is stronger,

00:05:15.792 --> 00:05:17.476
it didn't cost us more money.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.042
It was win-win.

00:05:24.875 --> 00:05:26.976
Another idea they had

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.643
was that we could reduce
our napkin by one inch.

00:05:30.667 --> 00:05:33.250
And make it from recycled office paper.

00:05:34.833 --> 00:05:37.559
I'm thinking, one inch, no big deal.

00:05:37.583 --> 00:05:41.684
We did it, it reduced waste
by three million pounds a year.

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:44.184
Sixteen thousand trees saved.

00:05:44.208 --> 00:05:48.351
(Applause)

00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:52.226
What was really cool
is we changed that bright white napkin,

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.184
because the recycled content
became gray and speckled.

00:05:56.208 --> 00:05:58.434
And we made that look, you know,

00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:00.792
in tune, in vogue with customers.

00:06:02.667 --> 00:06:06.476
So, I came to really enjoy

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.351
the time working with the EDF team.

00:06:09.375 --> 00:06:11.559
We had many dinners,
late-night discussions,

00:06:11.583 --> 00:06:13.643
we went to a ball game together.

00:06:13.667 --> 00:06:15.667
We became friends.

00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:18.893
And that's when I learned a life lesson.

00:06:18.917 --> 00:06:21.851
That these NGO crusaders,

00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:23.643
they're really no different than me.

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:26.059
They care, they have passion,

00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:28.184
we're just not different.

00:06:28.208 --> 00:06:30.226
So, we had a six-month partnership

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.684
that ended up producing a 42-point
waste reduction action plan.

00:06:34.708 --> 00:06:37.351
To reduce, reuse, recycle.

00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:39.476
We measured it during
the decade of the '90s,

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.250
and over 10 years we reduced
300 million pounds of waste.

00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:50.018
Now, if you're wondering
about that polystyrene clamshell,

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:51.851
yeah, we ditched it.

00:06:51.875 --> 00:06:54.976
And luckily, I still had a job.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.393
And this partnership was so successful

00:06:59.417 --> 00:07:04.351
that we went on to recycle
the idea to work with critics.

00:07:04.375 --> 00:07:06.726
Collaborate with them
on solutions that could work

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.375
for society and for business.

00:07:10.917 --> 00:07:14.101
But could this idea of collaborating

00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:17.309
work with the most contrarian folks?

00:07:17.333 --> 00:07:21.184
And on issues that are, you know,
not within our direct control.

00:07:21.208 --> 00:07:22.917
Like animal rights.

00:07:24.042 --> 00:07:25.309
Now, animal rights,

00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:28.226
obviously they don't want
animals used for meat.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.851
McDonald's, probably
the biggest purchaser of meat

00:07:30.875 --> 00:07:32.309
in the food service industry.

00:07:32.333 --> 00:07:34.893
So there's a natural conflict there.

00:07:34.917 --> 00:07:36.434
But I thought it would be best

00:07:36.458 --> 00:07:41.309
to go visit and learn from
the most vociferous and vigilant critics

00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:43.101
we had at that time,

00:07:43.125 --> 00:07:47.018
which were Henry Spira,
head of Animal Rights International,

00:07:47.042 --> 00:07:48.643
and Peter Singer,

00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:50.684
who wrote the book "Animal Liberation,"

00:07:50.708 --> 00:07:54.250
which is considered the modern treatise
about animal rights.

00:07:55.208 --> 00:07:57.184
You know, I read Peter's book to prepare,

00:07:57.208 --> 00:07:59.226
I tried to get into his mindset,

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.893
and I have to admit, it was tough,

00:08:00.917 --> 00:08:02.976
I'm not becoming a vegan,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.518
my company wasn't going that way.

00:08:05.542 --> 00:08:07.893
But I really thought we could learn a lot.

00:08:07.917 --> 00:08:10.893
And so I set up a breakfast meeting
in New York City.

00:08:10.917 --> 00:08:13.143
And I remember sitting down,
getting ready,

00:08:13.167 --> 00:08:15.559
and I decided I'm not
going to order my favorite,

00:08:15.583 --> 00:08:17.934
which is you know, bacon
and sausage and eggs.

00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.101
(Laughter)

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:22.684
And I'm just going to stick
to the pastries.

00:08:22.708 --> 00:08:23.976
But I have to admit,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.309
I was waiting for the adversarial
discussion to happen.

00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:29.268
And it never did.

00:08:29.292 --> 00:08:32.018
Henry and Peter were just gracious,

00:08:32.042 --> 00:08:35.559
they were caring, they were smart,
they asked good questions.

00:08:35.583 --> 00:08:38.143
I told them about
how working on animal welfare

00:08:38.167 --> 00:08:39.559
is very tough for McDonald's

00:08:39.583 --> 00:08:43.476
because our direct suppliers,
they only make meat patties.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.559
The animals are three or four steps
removed from our influence.

00:08:47.583 --> 00:08:49.851
And they were very empathetic.

00:08:49.875 --> 00:08:52.643
And while we were so directly opposed

00:08:52.667 --> 00:08:55.434
in terms of the missions
of our organizations,

00:08:55.458 --> 00:08:57.268
I felt that I had learned a lot.

00:08:57.292 --> 00:09:00.976
And best of all, they gave me
a terrific recommendation.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.351
And that is, they said,

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:05.393
"You should work with Dr. Temple Grandin."

00:09:05.417 --> 00:09:08.101
Now, I didn't know her at the time.

00:09:08.125 --> 00:09:09.393
But I tell you,

00:09:09.417 --> 00:09:14.643
she's the most renowned expert,
then and now, on animal behavior.

00:09:14.667 --> 00:09:18.833
And she knows how animals move
and how they should react in facilities.

00:09:19.708 --> 00:09:21.226
So I end up meeting her,

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.476
and she's the very best type of critic,

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.726
in a sense that
she just loves the animals,

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.018
wants to protect them,

00:09:28.042 --> 00:09:31.726
but she also understands
the reality of the meat business.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.018
And I'll always remember,

00:09:33.042 --> 00:09:36.018
I had never been
to a slaughterhouse in my life,

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:38.476
and so I go with her for my first trip.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.518
I didn't know what to expect.

00:09:40.542 --> 00:09:45.976
And we find that the animal handlers
have electric prods in their hands,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.268
and are basically zapping
almost every animal in the facility.

00:09:51.292 --> 00:09:54.309
We're both appalled,
she's jumping up and down,

00:09:54.333 --> 00:09:55.601
you'd have to know her,

00:09:55.625 --> 00:09:57.816
she's saying, "This can't be,
this isn't right,

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.983
we could use flags,
we could use plastic bags,

00:10:00.007 --> 00:10:03.083
we could redesign the corrals
for natural behavior."

00:10:04.125 --> 00:10:06.226
Well I set up Temple with our suppliers

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:09.309
to set up standards and guidelines.

00:10:09.333 --> 00:10:13.226
And ways to measure her ideas
of implementing animal welfare.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.809
We did this for the next
two to five years.

00:10:15.833 --> 00:10:18.976
And it all got integrated,
it all got enforced.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.559
By the way, two of McDonald's
suppliers lost business

00:10:21.583 --> 00:10:23.441
because they didn't meet our standards.

00:10:23.465 --> 00:10:24.726
And best of all,

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:28.976
all these standards ended up scaling
to the entire industry.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.226
And no more zapping of those animals.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.851
Now, what about issues
that we're blamed for elsewhere?

00:10:36.875 --> 00:10:39.059
Like deforestation.

00:10:39.083 --> 00:10:41.101
You know, on that issue, I always thought,

00:10:41.125 --> 00:10:44.101
policy makers and government,
that's their role.

00:10:44.125 --> 00:10:46.976
Never thought it would end up in my lap.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.559
But I remember in early April 2006,

00:10:49.583 --> 00:10:52.101
I opened up my Blackberry,

00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:56.018
and I'm reading about
Greenpeace campaigners

00:10:56.042 --> 00:11:00.184
showing up in the UK by the dozens,

00:11:00.208 --> 00:11:02.184
dressed as chickens,

00:11:02.208 --> 00:11:04.476
having breakfast at McDonald's

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.601
and chaining themselves
to the chairs and tables.

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:09.518
So they got a lot of attention,

00:11:09.542 --> 00:11:11.393
including mine.

00:11:11.417 --> 00:11:14.351
And I was wondering if the report
that they had just released,

00:11:14.375 --> 00:11:16.768
it was called "Eating Up the Amazon."

00:11:16.792 --> 00:11:20.184
And by the way, soy
is a key ingredient for chicken feed,

00:11:20.208 --> 00:11:22.726
and that's the connection to McDonald's.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.893
So I called my trusted friends
at the World Wildlife Fund,

00:11:25.917 --> 00:11:28.393
I called Conservation International,

00:11:28.417 --> 00:11:33.518
and I soon learned that
the Greenpeace report was accurate.

00:11:33.542 --> 00:11:35.268
So I gathered internal support,

00:11:35.292 --> 00:11:38.518
and I'll always remember,
next day, after that campaign,

00:11:38.542 --> 00:11:39.809
I called them up,

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:42.167
and I said, "We agree with you."

00:11:43.083 --> 00:11:46.351
And I said, "How about working together?"

00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:49.018
So three days later,

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:51.226
miraculously, four people from McDonald's,

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:52.726
four people from Greenpeace,

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.518
we're meeting in the London
Heathrow airport.

00:11:55.542 --> 00:11:58.476
And I have to say,
the first hour was shaky,

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.851
it wasn't a whole lot
of trust in the room.

00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:04.059
But it seemed like
everything came together,

00:12:04.083 --> 00:12:08.559
because each of us
wanted to save the Amazon.

00:12:08.583 --> 00:12:09.934
And during our discussions,

00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:12.226
you couldn't really tell, I don't think,

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:16.167
who was from Greenpeace
and who was from McDonald's.

00:12:17.458 --> 00:12:19.559
So one of the best things we did

00:12:19.583 --> 00:12:24.434
is we traveled with them for nine days
on a trip through the Amazon,

00:12:24.458 --> 00:12:28.059
on the Greenpeace airplane,
on the Greenpeace boat.

00:12:28.083 --> 00:12:30.601
And I'll always remember,

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:33.976
imagine traveling hundreds
of miles west of Manaus,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.643
the capital city of the Amazon.

00:12:36.667 --> 00:12:38.601
And it's so pristine beauty,

00:12:38.625 --> 00:12:41.351
there's no man-made structures,
there's no roads,

00:12:41.375 --> 00:12:43.476
not one wire, not one house.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.809
You would travel east of Manaus

00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:49.458
and you would see the blatant
rainforest destruction.

00:12:50.542 --> 00:12:56.809
So this very unlikely collaboration
produced outstanding results.

00:12:56.833 --> 00:12:58.101
By working together,

00:12:58.125 --> 00:13:02.143
we recruited over a dozen
other retailers and suppliers

00:13:02.167 --> 00:13:04.184
for the same cause.

00:13:04.208 --> 00:13:06.684
And by the way, within three months,

00:13:06.708 --> 00:13:09.809
a moratorium on these
clear-cutting practices

00:13:09.833 --> 00:13:12.268
was announced by the industry.

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:17.351
And Greenpeace themselves declared it
as a spectacular drop in deforestation

00:13:17.375 --> 00:13:19.500
and it's been in effect ever since.

00:13:20.917 --> 00:13:23.976
Now, you think these types
of collaborations that I've described

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.351
would be commonplace today.

00:13:26.375 --> 00:13:27.768
But they're not.

00:13:27.792 --> 00:13:30.268
When organizations are battered,

00:13:30.292 --> 00:13:34.059
the common response
is to deny and push back,

00:13:34.083 --> 00:13:36.143
put out some sort of lame statement

00:13:36.167 --> 00:13:38.893
and no progress is made at all.

00:13:38.917 --> 00:13:41.768
I say the alternative is really powerful.

00:13:41.792 --> 00:13:44.018
I mean, it's not going to fix
every problem,

00:13:44.042 --> 00:13:45.893
and there's more to do for sure,

00:13:45.917 --> 00:13:48.476
but this idea of working with critics

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.184
and trying to do more good for society

00:13:51.208 --> 00:13:53.184
that actually is good for business,

00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:55.768
believe me, it's possible.

00:13:55.792 --> 00:13:57.726
But it starts with the idea

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:02.893
that you need to assume
the best intentions of your critics.

00:14:02.917 --> 00:14:05.768
Just like you have the best intentions.

00:14:05.792 --> 00:14:07.184
And then secondly,

00:14:07.208 --> 00:14:09.518
you need to look past
a lot of these tactics.

00:14:09.542 --> 00:14:13.351
I admit, I did not like
a lot of the tactics

00:14:13.375 --> 00:14:15.101
used on my company.

00:14:15.125 --> 00:14:18.268
But instead, focus on what the truth is,

00:14:18.292 --> 00:14:19.851
what's the right thing to do,

00:14:19.875 --> 00:14:22.934
what's the science, what's the facts.

00:14:22.958 --> 00:14:25.226
And lastly, you know, I would say,

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.684
give the critics the keys.

00:14:27.708 --> 00:14:29.809
Show them the back room.

00:14:29.833 --> 00:14:31.809
Bring them there, don't hide the details,

00:14:31.833 --> 00:14:34.351
because if you want allies and support,

00:14:34.375 --> 00:14:36.792
you need to be open and transparent.

00:14:38.208 --> 00:14:41.059
Now, whether you're a corporate suit,

00:14:41.083 --> 00:14:43.018
whether you're a tree-hugger,

00:14:43.042 --> 00:14:45.809
I say the next time you're criticized,

00:14:45.833 --> 00:14:48.309
reach out, listen, learn.

00:14:48.333 --> 00:14:51.601
You'll become better,
your organization will become better,

00:14:51.625 --> 00:14:55.059
and you might make
some good friends along the way.

00:14:55.083 --> 00:14:56.351
Thank you.

00:14:56.375 --> 00:14:58.708
(Applause)
