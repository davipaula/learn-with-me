00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:16.341
About two and a half years ago,
I watched this movie called "Her."

00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:21.492
And it features Samantha,
a superintelligent form of AI

00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:23.276
that cannot take physical form.

00:00:23.858 --> 00:00:26.088
And because she can't
appear in photographs,

00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:28.128
Samantha decides to write a piece of music

00:00:28.152 --> 00:00:31.618
that will capture a moment of her life
just like a photograph would.

00:00:32.953 --> 00:00:37.361
As a musician and an engineer,
and someone raised in a family of artists,

00:00:37.385 --> 00:00:41.561
I thought that this idea of musical
photographs was really powerful.

00:00:41.955 --> 00:00:44.823
And I decided to create an AI composer.

00:00:44.847 --> 00:00:48.335
Her name is AIVA,
and she's an artificial intelligence

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:50.752
that has learned the art
of music composition

00:00:50.776 --> 00:00:53.561
by reading over 30,000 scores
of history's greatest.

00:00:54.165 --> 00:00:56.621
So here's what one score
looks like to the algorithm

00:00:56.645 --> 00:00:58.847
in a matrix-like representation.

00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:01.117
And here's what 30,000 scores,

00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:03.237
written by the likes
of Mozart and Beethoven,

00:01:03.261 --> 00:01:05.292
look like in a single frame.

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:11.949
So, using deep neural networks,
AIVA looks for patterns in the scores.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.823
And from a couple of bars
of existing music,

00:01:15.847 --> 00:01:19.555
it actually tries to infer what notes
should come next in those tracks.

00:01:19.887 --> 00:01:22.385
And once AIVA gets good
at those predictions,

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.022
it can actually build a set
of mathematical rules

00:01:26.046 --> 00:01:27.212
for that style of music

00:01:27.236 --> 00:01:30.024
in order to create
its own original compositions.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.199
And in a way, this is kind of
how we, humans, compose music, too.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.053
It's a trial-and-error process,

00:01:36.077 --> 00:01:39.085
during which we may not
get the right notes all the time.

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:40.498
But we can correct ourselves,

00:01:40.522 --> 00:01:43.815
either with our musical ear
or our musical knowledge.

00:01:45.495 --> 00:01:49.638
But for AIVA, this process
is taken from years and years of learning,

00:01:49.662 --> 00:01:52.924
decades of learning as an artist,
as a musician and a composer,

00:01:52.948 --> 00:01:54.681
down to a couple of hours.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.910
But music is also a supersubjective art.

00:01:57.934 --> 00:01:59.498
And we needed to teach AIVA

00:01:59.522 --> 00:02:01.967
how to compose the right music
for the right person,

00:02:01.991 --> 00:02:04.132
because people have different preferences.

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:08.346
And to do that, we show to the algorithm
over 30 different category labels

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.315
for each score in our database.

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:12.855
So those category labels are like mood

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.799
or note density or composer
style of a piece

00:02:15.823 --> 00:02:18.347
or the epoch during which it was written.

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:20.306
And by seeing all this data,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.386
AIVA can actually respond
to very precise requirements.

00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:27.069
Like the ones, for example,
we had for a project recently,

00:02:27.093 --> 00:02:30.128
where we were commissioned
to create a piece

00:02:30.152 --> 00:02:33.179
that would be reminiscent
of a science-fiction film soundtrack.

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:38.339
And the piece that was created
is called "Among the Stars"

00:02:38.363 --> 00:02:41.680
and it was recorded
with CMG Orchestra in Hollywood,

00:02:41.704 --> 00:02:43.418
under great conductor John Beal,

00:02:43.442 --> 00:02:46.509
and this is what they
recorded, made by AIVA.

00:02:47.657 --> 00:02:54.657
(Music)

00:03:30.196 --> 00:03:32.386
(Music ends)

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:35.926
What do you think?

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.330
(Applause)

00:03:40.354 --> 00:03:41.504
Thank you.

00:03:42.001 --> 00:03:46.056
So, as you've seen, AI can create
beautiful pieces of music,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.883
and the best part of it

00:03:47.907 --> 00:03:50.488
is that humans can actually
bring them to life.

00:03:51.506 --> 00:03:53.344
And it's not the first time in history

00:03:53.368 --> 00:03:56.712
that technology has augmented
human creativity.

00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:59.808
Live music was almost always
used in silent films

00:03:59.832 --> 00:04:01.498
to augment the experience.

00:04:01.522 --> 00:04:04.704
But the problem with live music
is that it didn't scale.

00:04:04.728 --> 00:04:08.157
It's really hard to cram a full symphony
into a small theater,

00:04:08.181 --> 00:04:11.172
and it's really hard to do that
for every theater in the world.

00:04:11.196 --> 00:04:14.045
So when music recording
was actually invented,

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.418
it allowed content creators,
like film creators,

00:04:16.442 --> 00:04:19.228
to have prerecorded and original music

00:04:19.252 --> 00:04:22.125
tailored to each and every frame
of their stories.

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:24.775
And that was really
an enhancer of creativity.

00:04:26.617 --> 00:04:29.903
Two and a half years ago,
when I watched this movie "Her,"

00:04:29.927 --> 00:04:32.834
I thought to myself
that personalized music

00:04:32.858 --> 00:04:37.275
would be the next single biggest change
in how we consume and create music.

00:04:38.187 --> 00:04:42.409
Because nowadays, we have
interactive content, like video games,

00:04:42.433 --> 00:04:45.448
that have hundreds of hours
of interactive game plays,

00:04:45.472 --> 00:04:47.585
but only two hours of music, on average.

00:04:47.609 --> 00:04:50.101
And it means that the music
loops and loops and loops

00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:52.457
over and over again,
and it's not very immersive.

00:04:52.467 --> 00:04:56.418
So what we're working on
is to make sure that AI can compose

00:04:56.442 --> 00:04:58.744
hundreds of hours of personalized music

00:04:58.768 --> 00:05:02.634
for those use cases
where human creativity doesn't scale.

00:05:03.363 --> 00:05:05.569
And we don't just want
to do that for games.

00:05:06.657 --> 00:05:11.085
Beethoven actually wrote a piece
for his beloved, called "FÃ¼r Elise,"

00:05:11.109 --> 00:05:14.760
and imagine if we could
bring back Beethoven to life.

00:05:14.784 --> 00:05:20.014
And if he was sitting next to you,
composing a music for your personality

00:05:20.038 --> 00:05:21.371
and your life story.

00:05:22.632 --> 00:05:25.411
Or imagine if someone like
Martin Luther King, for example,

00:05:25.435 --> 00:05:27.474
had a personalized AI composer.

00:05:27.498 --> 00:05:28.871
Maybe then we would remember

00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:30.951
"I Have a Dream" not only
as a great speech,

00:05:30.975 --> 00:05:33.601
but also as a great piece of music,
part of our history,

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:35.758
and capturing Dr. King's ideals.

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:37.958
And this is our vision at AIVA:

00:05:37.982 --> 00:05:40.560
to personalize music
so that each and every one of you

00:05:40.584 --> 00:05:42.233
and every individual in the world

00:05:42.257 --> 00:05:45.331
can have access to a personalized
live soundtrack,

00:05:45.355 --> 00:05:47.860
based on their story
and their personality.

00:05:49.915 --> 00:05:53.994
So this moment here together at TED
is now part of our life story.

00:05:54.018 --> 00:05:58.187
So it only felt fitting that AIVA
would compose music for this moment.

00:05:58.674 --> 00:06:01.118
And that's exactly what we did.

00:06:01.436 --> 00:06:06.458
So my team and I worked on biasing AIVA
on the style of the TED jingle,

00:06:06.482 --> 00:06:09.926
and on music that makes us feel
a sense of awe and wonder.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.863
And the result is called
"The Age of Amazement."

00:06:13.887 --> 00:06:16.283
Didn't take an AI to figure that one out.

00:06:16.307 --> 00:06:17.457
(Laughter)

00:06:18.152 --> 00:06:20.554
And I couldn't be more proud
to show it to you,

00:06:20.578 --> 00:06:23.006
so if you can, close your eyes
and enjoy the music.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.363
Thank you very much.

00:06:25.537 --> 00:06:29.732
(Music)

00:06:35.176 --> 00:06:37.843
[The Age of Amazement
Composed by AIVA]

00:08:19.649 --> 00:08:20.800
(Music ends)

00:08:20.824 --> 00:08:22.197
This was for all of you.

00:08:22.221 --> 00:08:23.387
Thank you.

00:08:23.411 --> 00:08:27.984
(Applause)
