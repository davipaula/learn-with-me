00:00:04.833 --> 00:00:06.396
I'm 36 years old.

00:00:06.396 --> 00:00:08.650
My first experience
with the video game business

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.316
was neighbors who were wealthier than us

00:00:11.316 --> 00:00:13.553
bringing home an Atari 2600
and playing it.

00:00:13.553 --> 00:00:15.509
It was a pretty definitive moment for me.

00:00:16.012 --> 00:00:19.995
I also remember going to school,
and on an Apple 2,

00:00:20.005 --> 00:00:23.055
playing a game called
"Where in the World is Carmen San Diego",

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:24.765
an awesome game,

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:29.169
which was the first time I played the game
in the school context.

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.300
When you ask people about the video game
business and what's significant,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.881
most people think that Atari 2600
is really the nexus,

00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:38.919
the catalyst of the video game business.

00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:42.609
But I think that "Where in the World
is Carmen San Diego" is probably

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.588
the most important video game ever made,

00:00:44.588 --> 00:00:48.326
principally because it was
the first and the last time

00:00:48.326 --> 00:00:52.373
that parents, teachers and kids all agreed
that a video game was awesome.

00:00:52.373 --> 00:00:54.243
(Laughter)

00:00:54.243 --> 00:00:57.064
Now, that was a long time ago.

00:00:57.064 --> 00:00:59.100
In fact, it was 1987.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.969
It may surprise you to know

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.937
that "Where in the World
is Carmen San Diego" continues to be

00:01:03.937 --> 00:01:07.532
the last substantial giant hit
in the entertainment business,

00:01:07.532 --> 00:01:12.047
despite the fact that it was 1987,
which is such an incredibly long time ago.

00:01:12.047 --> 00:01:13.355
I am only 36.

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:14.874
You can do the math.

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:17.668
Things are completely different today
from what they were.

00:01:17.668 --> 00:01:18.968
Just as a simple example,

00:01:18.968 --> 00:01:21.387
in 1987, we thought
this guy was kind of crazy.

00:01:21.387 --> 00:01:23.328
Then we met this dude,

00:01:23.328 --> 00:01:25.848
who's really changed
our perspective on that subject.

00:01:25.848 --> 00:01:28.518
(Laughter)

00:01:28.532 --> 00:01:29.897
Things have changed.

00:01:29.897 --> 00:01:33.549
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.512
Anti-Bush political humor
goes a long way in Western Europe.

00:01:36.512 --> 00:01:37.409
Okay.

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.345
(Laughter)

00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:40.051
So, between 1987 and now,

00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:42.571
I played a lot of this game,
called "Civilization",

00:01:42.571 --> 00:01:44.884
which was designed by a guy
named Sid Meier.

00:01:44.884 --> 00:01:48.790
In fact, I spent about 8 to 10,000
hours of my life playing "Civilization",

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.667
which is a long time I probably
should have spent studying.

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:55.097
But nonetheless, I managed to turn
this love of video games into a job.

00:01:55.097 --> 00:01:57.558
First working
on the Game Developers Conference,

00:01:57.558 --> 00:02:01.261
helping to start the first, successful,
digital distribution company in games,

00:02:01.261 --> 00:02:02.262
called TRYMEDIA,

00:02:02.262 --> 00:02:04.229
and now, writing Gamification Blog.

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.834
I'm author of two books on the subject
of Gamification, including the recent

00:02:07.834 --> 00:02:10.113
"Gamification by Design",
published by O'Reilly.

00:02:10.113 --> 00:02:12.113
And, I chaired the Gamification Summit,

00:02:12.113 --> 00:02:14.219
an event that brings
all this stuff together.

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:18.859
In many ways, I am parents' dream
of how somebody can turn

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.769
a sedentary lifestyle,
playing video games,

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.298
into an actual career
that pays real money.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.522
When I get invited to an event like this,

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:30.398
I'm sure that all of you
expect me to get up here and say,

00:02:30.398 --> 00:02:32.678
"Games are awesome for your children."
Right?

00:02:32.678 --> 00:02:35.424
Because I'm a game's guy
and this is how I make my living.

00:02:35.424 --> 00:02:36.299
(Applause)

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.822
Games will help children.

00:02:37.822 --> 00:02:40.409
But instead, I want to ask you
a different question,

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.639
which is really who needs game's help?

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:46.224
I started this process by thinking
about reading a particular article

00:02:46.224 --> 00:02:47.743
in the New York Times recently.

00:02:47.743 --> 00:02:50.100
In the article, a neuroscientist
was talking about

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.541
how children were presenting themselves
with Attention Deficit Disorder.

00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:55.256
Their parents would come in and say,

00:02:55.256 --> 00:02:57.195
"My kids can't possibly have ADD,

00:02:57.195 --> 00:03:00.619
because they're super good
at focusing on video games."

00:03:00.631 --> 00:03:03.108
But when they go to school,
they were really bad.

00:03:03.108 --> 00:03:05.259
The neuroscientist
was debunking this idea.

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:06.455
Right in the article,

00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:09.519
she trotted out researchers
like Dr. Christopher Lucas at NYU,

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.609
who said games don't teach
the right kind of attention skills

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.973
where kids have sustained attention

00:03:14.973 --> 00:03:17.423
where they're not receiving
regular rewards.

00:03:17.423 --> 00:03:18.798
She trotted out experts

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:21.657
like Dr. Dimitri Christakis
at the University of Washington,

00:03:21.657 --> 00:03:23.965
who said that kids
who play a lot of video games

00:03:23.965 --> 00:03:26.909
may find the real world unpalatable,
uninteresting,

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.159
as a result
of their sensitization to games.

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.014
So I sat there and I thought to myself,

00:03:31.014 --> 00:03:33.398
I'm scratching my head, 
and I thought to myself,

00:03:33.398 --> 00:03:36.196
is it that our children have ADD

00:03:36.196 --> 00:03:41.931
or is our world just too freaking slow
for our children to appreciate?

00:03:41.931 --> 00:03:43.113
(Applause)

00:03:43.113 --> 00:03:46.365
Seriously, consider the picture
you're looking at right now,

00:03:46.365 --> 00:03:48.909
like in my era,
even my grandfather's era,

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:53.812
sitting down on a Sunday afternoon
to read a good book with a cup of tea -

00:03:54.127 --> 00:03:55.162
I just have to say,

00:03:55.162 --> 00:03:58.012
I don't think that today's kids
are ever going to do that.

00:03:58.012 --> 00:04:00.521
The evidence is found
in the games they play.

00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:02.595
Consider the video game
"World of Warcraft",

00:04:02.595 --> 00:04:04.778
When I was growing up,
the maximum skill

00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:07.298
that I was expected to display
in a video game,

00:04:07.298 --> 00:04:09.153
was simple hand eye coordination,

00:04:09.153 --> 00:04:10.751
a joystick and a firing button.

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:12.442
Today's kids play games,

00:04:12.442 --> 00:04:15.020
in which they're expected to chat
in text and voice,

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.607
operate a character,
follow long- and short-term objectives,

00:04:18.607 --> 00:04:22.354
and deal with their parents' interrupting
them all the time and talk to them.

00:04:22.354 --> 00:04:23.522
(Laughter)

00:04:23.522 --> 00:04:26.048
Kids have to have
an extraordinary multitasking skill

00:04:26.048 --> 00:04:27.778
to be able to achieve things today.

00:04:27.778 --> 00:04:29.564
We never had to have that.

00:04:29.564 --> 00:04:33.565
It turns out things like that
actually make you smarter.

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:36.968
Research by Arne May
at University Regensburg in Germany

00:04:36.968 --> 00:04:39.418
found that when they gave participants -

00:04:39.418 --> 00:04:41.788
this was actually done on adults -

00:04:41.788 --> 00:04:44.157
simple task to learn, like juggling,

00:04:44.157 --> 00:04:45.157
in 12 weeks,

00:04:45.157 --> 00:04:47.297
people who were asked to learn juggling

00:04:47.297 --> 00:04:51.206
displayed a marked increase
in gray matters in their brain.

00:04:51.206 --> 00:04:54.108
On an MRI, you can see
people get more gray matter

00:04:54.108 --> 00:04:56.475
after 12 weeks of learning juggling.

00:04:56.475 --> 00:04:59.451
In 2008, they went back
and redid the study to see

00:04:59.451 --> 00:05:01.511
why the gray matter increased.

00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:03.551
They discovered it was the act of learning

00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:05.834
that produced the increased brain matter,

00:05:05.834 --> 00:05:08.353
not performance at the activity itself,

00:05:08.353 --> 00:05:10.323
which is a very interesting finding.

00:05:10.323 --> 00:05:14.159
It also reinforced this idea,
which should go over well here as well,

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:17.761
that multi-lingual people
outperform mono-lingual people

00:05:17.761 --> 00:05:20.751
on most standardized tests by about 15%.

00:05:20.751 --> 00:05:24.240
There's something that happens
in the brain from that kind of activity.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.903
Andrea Kuszewski,
speaking at Harvard, talked about

00:05:27.903 --> 00:05:32.356
these five things that people do
to increase their brain matter,

00:05:32.356 --> 00:05:35.339
to teach themselves,
to increase their fluid intelligence.

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:38.835
Fluid intelligence is the intelligence
we use to problem solve.

00:05:38.835 --> 00:05:41.005
It's different from
crystalline intelligence,

00:05:41.005 --> 00:05:42.420
it helps us problem solve.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.064
She identified, from the research,

00:05:44.064 --> 00:05:46.037
that there were 5 things you could do -

00:05:46.037 --> 00:05:47.314
seek novelty,

00:05:47.314 --> 00:05:48.822
challenge yourself,

00:05:48.822 --> 00:05:49.817
think creatively,

00:05:49.817 --> 00:05:50.932
do things the hard way,

00:05:50.932 --> 00:05:51.898
and network.

00:05:51.898 --> 00:05:53.705
Think about those 5 things.

00:05:53.705 --> 00:05:55.564
Any of you play video games?

00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:59.391
Does it resemble the basic pattern
of a video game to you in any way?

00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:03.720
These are 5 things that recur
in all very successful video games.

00:06:04.712 --> 00:06:08.871
It also was connected to a constant
and exponential increase in learning.

00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:12.884
Video games fundamentally present
a continuous process of learning to users.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.268
They don't just learn
for a little while and then stop.

00:06:16.268 --> 00:06:18.711
They're constantly evolving
and moving forward.

00:06:19.164 --> 00:06:23.121
It may help us to explain
the "flynn effect", finally.

00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:25.756
The flynn effect, for those of you
who don't know,

00:06:25.756 --> 00:06:29.095
is the pattern that human intelligence
is actually rising over time.

00:06:29.095 --> 00:06:33.184
So, if we look at the history of IQ,
people are getting smarter.

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:34.884
In the US right now,

00:06:34.884 --> 00:06:38.345
average IQ is rising
at .36 points of IQ per year.

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:42.307
What has been very interesting
is that in some countries -

00:06:42.307 --> 00:06:44.735
not to call anyone out
but Denmark and Norway -

00:06:44.735 --> 00:06:47.012
In some countries, overall crystalline IQ

00:06:47.012 --> 00:06:50.012
has stopped or slowed down or declined.

00:06:50.012 --> 00:06:51.720
In other countries though,

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.677
particularly when looking at fluid IQ,
fluid intelligence,

00:06:54.677 --> 00:06:56.333
the number is increasing.

00:06:56.333 --> 00:06:59.859
The rate of fluid intelligence
increase is increasing,

00:06:59.859 --> 00:07:01.959
starting in the 1990s.

00:07:02.432 --> 00:07:03.795
Coincidence?

00:07:03.795 --> 00:07:04.660
I think not.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.670
(Laughter)

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:10.409
In fact, games are wired to produce
a particular kind of reaction in people.

00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:12.701
We got this learning brain increase,

00:07:12.701 --> 00:07:15.228
multitasking brain increase connection,

00:07:15.228 --> 00:07:17.818
and we also have a strong
dopamine loop in the brain.

00:07:18.661 --> 00:07:20.266
As games present a challenge,

00:07:20.266 --> 00:07:23.424
and you struggle to achieve that challenge
and you overcome it,

00:07:23.424 --> 00:07:25.607
dopamine is released in your brain.

00:07:25.607 --> 00:07:28.757
That produces an intrinsic reinforcement -
in the words of Judy -

00:07:28.757 --> 00:07:31.277
that produces an intrinsic reinforcement,

00:07:31.277 --> 00:07:32.727
that causes you to go back

00:07:32.727 --> 00:07:35.610
and keep seeking that activity
over and over again.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.720
So, this is really powerful stuff.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:43.097
I want to introduce you to an educator,
who understands this in intricate detail,

00:07:43.097 --> 00:07:44.910
named Ananth Pai.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.581
Ananth was a very successful
business person,

00:07:47.598 --> 00:07:50.248
who worked on process reengineering.

00:07:50.858 --> 00:07:54.566
When his kids went into school
in White Bear Lake, Minnisota,

00:07:54.567 --> 00:07:56.688
a suburb of Minneapolis-Saint Paul,

00:07:56.688 --> 00:07:58.068
he saw the education system

00:07:58.068 --> 00:08:00.524
and decided he wanted
to do something about it.

00:08:00.524 --> 00:08:03.368
As an adult, he went back
and got a master in Education,

00:08:03.368 --> 00:08:06.320
and took over a class
at White Bear Lake Elementary School.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.759
Ananth Pie replaced
the standard curriculum

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:11.490
with the video game based curriculum
of his own design.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:15.620
Separating the kids into leaning styles,
and giving them Nintendo DS's

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.717
and computer games.

00:08:16.717 --> 00:08:18.238
Everything off the shelf,

00:08:18.238 --> 00:08:19.620
nothing custom.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.995
Giving them Nintendo DS's
and computer games

00:08:21.995 --> 00:08:24.345
that were both individual
and social to play,

00:08:24.345 --> 00:08:26.172
that taught them math and language.

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:27.941
Let me tell you what happened.

00:08:27.941 --> 00:08:32.764
In this base of 18 weeks, Mr. Pie's class

00:08:32.764 --> 00:08:36.704
went from a below 3rd-grade level
in reading and math,

00:08:36.704 --> 00:08:40.021
to a mid-4th-grade level
in reading and math.

00:08:40.021 --> 00:08:43.322
In 18 weeks of a game based curriculum.

00:08:43.974 --> 00:08:46.499
More importantly,
when you talk to the children,

00:08:46.499 --> 00:08:49.594
when they're interviewed on television,
even away from Mr. Pie,

00:08:49.594 --> 00:08:53.413
when they're interviewed on television,
they say two things over and over again,

00:08:53.413 --> 00:08:55.373
that helps them learn in his class:

00:08:55.373 --> 00:08:58.800
learning is fun,
and learning is multi-player.

00:09:00.146 --> 00:09:02.248
Whether they use those exact words or not,

00:09:02.248 --> 00:09:05.105
they say learning if fun
and learning is multi-player.

00:09:05.105 --> 00:09:08.627
This is the key in making that experience
really successful for kids.

00:09:08.627 --> 00:09:11.142
It's also true though
that we need to talk about

00:09:11.142 --> 00:09:13.832
the relationship between kids
and violence in games.

00:09:13.832 --> 00:09:16.202
Study after study, very clearly tells you,

00:09:16.202 --> 00:09:18.469
that violent games
do not make children violent.

00:09:18.469 --> 00:09:20.087
We also must acknowledge, however,

00:09:20.087 --> 00:09:22.587
that if you have a child
predisposed to violence,

00:09:22.587 --> 00:09:25.221
violent games may help make them
a better violent child.

00:09:25.221 --> 00:09:28.601
If they train kids to do other things,
they also would train that.

00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:29.960
We need to accept that.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.550
We need to understand the connection
between games as a form of training.

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:36.247
We can't blanket,
say that they don't affect kids.

00:09:36.247 --> 00:09:37.432
It's not true.

00:09:37.432 --> 00:09:41.663
I'd like to call the group of people
who are driving this trend forward

00:09:41.663 --> 00:09:42.816
"Generation G".

00:09:42.816 --> 00:09:46.481
There're 126 million Millennials
in the United States and the EU,

00:09:46.481 --> 00:09:50.478
plus younger kids we can't yet count,
that form Generation G.

00:09:50.498 --> 00:09:54.434
And the way that Generation G
is different from X, Y,

00:09:54.434 --> 00:09:57.522
and all the different generations
that we may belong to,

00:09:57.522 --> 00:10:00.232
is that video games
are the primary form of entertainment

00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:02.286
that Generation G is consuming.

00:10:02.286 --> 00:10:04.336
It is their primary form of entertainment.

00:10:04.336 --> 00:10:07.463
This is already starting to have
a tremendous effect on society.

00:10:07.463 --> 00:10:11.581
All around us, generation G's desire
for game-like experiences

00:10:11.581 --> 00:10:13.096
is reshaping industries.

00:10:13.096 --> 00:10:17.636
From Foursquare, which caused the mobile
social networking ecosystem to start,

00:10:17.636 --> 00:10:22.744
to companies like Nike, Coke, Chase,
and also Koxinga,

00:10:22.744 --> 00:10:25.197
which owes much of its success to games.

00:10:25.197 --> 00:10:28.833
The trend that underlies
this whole pattern is called Gamification.

00:10:29.645 --> 00:10:31.547
It's a word that many of you have heard.

00:10:31.547 --> 00:10:33.617
A simple definition of gaminfication

00:10:33.617 --> 00:10:37.186
is it's the process of using game thinking
and game mechanics

00:10:37.186 --> 00:10:39.809
to engage audiences and solve problems.

00:10:39.809 --> 00:10:40.809
Part of the reason

00:10:40.809 --> 00:10:43.636
why gamification has become
such an emerging topic right now

00:10:43.636 --> 00:10:47.182
is because Generation G's effect
on culture and society already.

00:10:47.182 --> 00:10:48.957
Their expectations are different.

00:10:48.957 --> 00:10:51.462
Some examples of gamification
that you may have seen,

00:10:51.462 --> 00:10:53.223
that are really fascinating to me,

00:10:53.223 --> 00:10:55.954
are the emergence
of in-dashboard games in cars.

00:10:55.954 --> 00:10:59.809
Today, if you buy a hybrid
or an electric vehicle,

00:10:59.809 --> 00:11:03.684
you'll almost certainly see the product
of a hundred million dollars worth

00:11:03.684 --> 00:11:07.748
of tooling and research and development,
in the form of a Tamagotchi style game,

00:11:07.748 --> 00:11:11.838
in a dashboard designed to make you
a more ecological driver.

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:12.948
It's simple.

00:11:12.948 --> 00:11:15.076
Most of the game mechanics
are very simple.

00:11:15.076 --> 00:11:17.643
A plant grows as you drive
more ecologically,

00:11:17.643 --> 00:11:18.973
and withers if you don't,

00:11:18.973 --> 00:11:21.436
like those virtual pets Tamagotchi.

00:11:21.436 --> 00:11:24.743
This is an example
of gamification at work.

00:11:24.743 --> 00:11:26.953
Another really interesting example,

00:11:26.953 --> 00:11:29.331
is a thing called Speed Camera Lottery,

00:11:29.331 --> 00:11:32.605
designed by Kevin Richardson,
based in San Francisco, works for MTV.

00:11:32.605 --> 00:11:33.582
Awesome guy.

00:11:33.582 --> 00:11:35.703
This is the concept
in speed camera lottery -

00:11:35.703 --> 00:11:38.155
you know those speeding cameras,
that you pass by,

00:11:38.155 --> 00:11:40.435
they take your picture
and send you a ticket?

00:11:40.435 --> 00:11:41.915
In many Scandinavian countries,

00:11:41.915 --> 00:11:45.476
the ticket you get is actually
based not only on how fast you were going,

00:11:45.476 --> 00:11:47.152
but how much money you make.

00:11:47.152 --> 00:11:49.349
So, the more you make,
the bigger the ticket.

00:11:49.349 --> 00:11:51.916
Kevin re-engineered
a speeding camera in Sweden,

00:11:51.916 --> 00:11:53.777
that instead of just giving tickets

00:11:53.777 --> 00:11:56.829
to people who drive over the speed limit
that past the camera,

00:11:56.829 --> 00:12:00.377
anybody who drives under the limit
is entered into a lottery

00:12:00.377 --> 00:12:02.649
to win the proceeds
of the people who speed.

00:12:02.649 --> 00:12:05.037
(Laughter)

00:12:06.897 --> 00:12:11.070
It is game thinking -
that term I described earlier -

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:13.027
the core foundation of gamification.

00:12:13.027 --> 00:12:15.869
It is game thinking, in its purest
and most beautiful form -

00:12:15.869 --> 00:12:18.097
take a big negative reinforcement loop,

00:12:18.097 --> 00:12:21.324
and turn it into small incremental
positive reinforcement loop.

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:25.124
It had the effect of dropping speed
by over 20% at that point of intervention.

00:12:25.124 --> 00:12:28.344
Corporations have also
become aware of the trend of gamification,

00:12:28.344 --> 00:12:31.251
and the effect games on people,
like Generation G.

00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:36.049
Gartner Group says that, by 2015,
70% of all global 2000,

00:12:36.049 --> 00:12:39.439
the biggest companies in the world,
will be actively using gamification,

00:12:39.439 --> 00:12:42.930
and 50% of their process of innovation
will be gamified,

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:45.046
which is an astonishing thing.

00:12:45.046 --> 00:12:46.328
It's a huge change.

00:12:46.328 --> 00:12:47.833
What this all points to

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:51.474
is a future that looks pretty different
from the world that we live in today.

00:12:51.474 --> 00:12:55.092
Generation G, and those driving
the gamification moving forward,

00:12:55.092 --> 00:12:57.505
are advocating for a different world.

00:12:57.505 --> 00:13:01.886
It's a world in which things move
at faster pace than it did for you and me.

00:13:01.886 --> 00:13:04.635
It's a world
in which there're rewards everywhere

00:13:04.635 --> 00:13:06.375
for actions that people take.

00:13:06.375 --> 00:13:08.911
The rewards don't always have to be
cash rewards.

00:13:08.911 --> 00:13:11.031
They can be meaningful status rewards,

00:13:11.031 --> 00:13:12.601
meaningful access rewards,

00:13:12.601 --> 00:13:14.224
meaningful power rewards.

00:13:14.224 --> 00:13:16.845
A world in which there's extensive
collaborative play.

00:13:16.845 --> 00:13:19.111
This is one of the things
that Generation G does

00:13:19.111 --> 00:13:21.206
so much differently
than even my generation.

00:13:21.206 --> 00:13:25.685
I remember going to school and teachers
struggling to come up with exercises

00:13:25.685 --> 00:13:29.030
that we could do as a team
that would be graded as a team.

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.027
Right?

00:13:30.027 --> 00:13:33.734
In the end, those group exercises
always boil down to an individual score,

00:13:33.734 --> 00:13:36.003
which distorted the way
that people behaved.

00:13:36.003 --> 00:13:38.103
But, Generation G plays a lot of games

00:13:38.103 --> 00:13:41.121
that are purely collaborative,
in which there is group value.

00:13:41.121 --> 00:13:43.576
This will also affect our world
in untold ways.

00:13:44.082 --> 00:13:47.157
Generation G, the fun future,
is a much more global world.

00:13:47.157 --> 00:13:51.995
It turns out that we are
already out of touch.

00:13:51.995 --> 00:13:57.351
We are the generation most out of touch
with our future or current children

00:13:57.351 --> 00:13:59.030
than any generation in history.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.345
We like to think
that baby boomers' parents

00:14:02.345 --> 00:14:04.862
were the most out of touch people
in the world.

00:14:04.862 --> 00:14:07.308
They're the ones
who had to deal with the like,

00:14:07.308 --> 00:14:10.090
summer of love, sex, drugs,
and all that kind of stuff.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.539
We still make phone calls.

00:14:11.539 --> 00:14:12.734
(Laughter)

00:14:12.734 --> 00:14:14.846
I mean, we are the ones with the problem.

00:14:14.846 --> 00:14:17.888
We are going to be the most
out of touch generation in history.

00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:21.991
Of course, it's also true,
and I'm here to tell you,

00:14:21.991 --> 00:14:24.987
I will be the one to tell you,
the kids are alright.

00:14:25.538 --> 00:14:27.777
They're going to be just fine.

00:14:27.777 --> 00:14:31.962
We don't need to worry, strictly speaking,

00:14:31.962 --> 00:14:33.891
about kids and games,

00:14:33.891 --> 00:14:35.841
and the effect it'll have on the world,

00:14:35.841 --> 00:14:38.126
Not just are the kids
are going to be alright,

00:14:38.126 --> 00:14:40.474
frankly, the kids are going to be awesome.

00:14:41.069 --> 00:14:43.928
But it's going to take your help
to make the kids awesome.

00:14:43.928 --> 00:14:45.822
I have a prescription for you.

00:14:45.822 --> 00:14:51.329
This is the best prescription anybody
is ever going to write in your life.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:53.989
I'm going to write it for you right now,

00:14:53.989 --> 00:14:56.516
in your mind, I don't have an actual pad.

00:14:56.516 --> 00:14:58.916
Just for clarity, a disclaimer,
I'm not a doctor.

00:14:58.916 --> 00:15:00.598
(Laughter)

00:15:00.598 --> 00:15:02.994
I am going to write a prescription
for you all.

00:15:03.464 --> 00:15:05.131
This is the prescription.

00:15:05.131 --> 00:15:07.409
If you have children,
or you work with children,

00:15:07.409 --> 00:15:10.756
or you desire to work with children,
or you want to change he world,

00:15:10.756 --> 00:15:14.160
this is the absolute positive best thing
that you can do with your time,

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.637
from now until I see you
in the retirement home,

00:15:16.637 --> 00:15:19.343
on the coast of Spain,
or in the virtual world,

00:15:19.343 --> 00:15:21.400
wherever you choose to retire.

00:15:21.408 --> 00:15:25.152
Which is - get into the game
with your kids.

00:15:25.152 --> 00:15:28.482
Stop fighting the game trend,
if that's where you are right now.

00:15:28.482 --> 00:15:29.990
Don't fight the game trend.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.739
Become one with the game.

00:15:31.739 --> 00:15:32.849
Enter the game.

00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:33.982
Understand it.

00:15:33.982 --> 00:15:35.460
Understand the dynamic

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.183
of how your children play the games
that they play.

00:15:38.183 --> 00:15:42.486
Understand how their minds work
from the context of the game outward

00:15:42.486 --> 00:15:45.284
rather than from the world outside inward.

00:15:45.284 --> 00:15:47.047
The world that we live in right now,

00:15:47.047 --> 00:15:50.255
the world that Sunday afternoons,
drinking a cup of herbal tea,

00:15:50.255 --> 00:15:54.014
reading some old book,
chilling out by the window,

00:15:54.014 --> 00:15:55.534
is over.

00:15:55.534 --> 00:15:56.894
(Laughter)

00:15:57.084 --> 00:15:58.655
And that's okay.

00:15:58.655 --> 00:16:02.558
There's a lot more things that we can do
that are fun and engaging.

00:16:02.558 --> 00:16:05.407
If you take away one thing
from today's presentation,

00:16:05.407 --> 00:16:08.681
I hope it is you get a chance
to go play with your kids.

00:16:08.681 --> 00:16:09.818
Thank you.

00:16:09.818 --> 00:16:11.258
(Applause)
