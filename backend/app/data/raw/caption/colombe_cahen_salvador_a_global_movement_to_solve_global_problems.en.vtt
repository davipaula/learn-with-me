00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.302
For years, I have been
working on a simple idea:

00:00:16.326 --> 00:00:19.321
for humanity to take its next leap ahead,

00:00:19.345 --> 00:00:23.436
we need to work together across borders
to solve global issues.

00:00:24.111 --> 00:00:25.264
In the modern world,

00:00:25.288 --> 00:00:28.133
no wall or border
can protect us from crisis.

00:00:28.157 --> 00:00:31.263
We have no other choice but to unite,

00:00:31.287 --> 00:00:33.280
and we need to do it fast.

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:36.444
In 2016, I was devastated
by the UK's decision

00:00:36.468 --> 00:00:38.103
to leave the European Union.

00:00:38.627 --> 00:00:42.966
I'm French, and for me, the EU is a symbol
of a more open and global society.

00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:45.803
But suddenly, my beliefs were shattered.

00:00:45.827 --> 00:00:48.191
And I wasn't alone in feeling this way.

00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:49.843
My partner, Andrea, who's Italian,

00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:51.931
and Damian, a German friend,

00:00:51.955 --> 00:00:54.962
also felt the shock of seeing
the world turning inward.

00:00:55.335 --> 00:00:58.272
We realized that despite being
from three different countries,

00:00:58.296 --> 00:01:00.164
we witnessed the same challenges:

00:01:00.188 --> 00:01:03.195
migration flows being dealt with
in an inhuman manner,

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.369
climate change

00:01:04.393 --> 00:01:05.940
or high youth unemployment.

00:01:05.964 --> 00:01:09.525
And we also had the same hopes and dreams
in our everyday lives.

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:12.083
We also realized
that to solve European issues,

00:01:12.107 --> 00:01:15.840
the outdated model of always
putting national interests first

00:01:15.864 --> 00:01:17.120
had to go.

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:18.736
So we decided to act.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.259
For a few months, we worked on
the idea of launching Volt,

00:01:22.283 --> 00:01:24.902
the first pan-European political movement.

00:01:25.322 --> 00:01:28.129
And then, naturally, we told
our Facebook friends,

00:01:28.153 --> 00:01:31.602
and a lot of them responded
saying they were up for the challenge

00:01:31.626 --> 00:01:33.074
and wanted to help.

00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:37.372
People started holding small
community meetings in parks,

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:38.938
universities and pubs

00:01:38.962 --> 00:01:40.954
to discuss their common future

00:01:40.978 --> 00:01:44.275
and share their solutions
to the continent's biggest problems.

00:01:44.872 --> 00:01:49.636
We mobilized tens of thousands of people
across 28 European countries

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.189
Two years in,

00:01:51.213 --> 00:01:53.371
Damian was elected
to the European parliament

00:01:53.395 --> 00:01:56.537
on the campaign run
by volunteers across borders

00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:58.802
on the idea that we are stronger together.

00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:01.922
We showed that by
collaborating across borders,

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:03.986
by uniting and acting as one,

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.401
we could start changing how people think.

00:02:06.943 --> 00:02:09.632
We were the first ones to attempt
something of this scale

00:02:09.656 --> 00:02:10.930
and to succeed.

00:02:10.954 --> 00:02:12.199
Despite this,

00:02:12.223 --> 00:02:14.915
after the European elections in May 2019,

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:16.993
Andrea and I looked into each other's eyes

00:02:17.017 --> 00:02:20.734
and asked that frank question
that you never want to ask

00:02:20.758 --> 00:02:23.242
once you have worked for two years
towards something

00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:24.594
that actually worked out:

00:02:24.618 --> 00:02:26.029
"Is this enough?"

00:02:26.402 --> 00:02:27.666
No, it wasn't.

00:02:28.358 --> 00:02:31.459
We knew that today's urgent challenges
are not just European

00:02:31.483 --> 00:02:32.666
but global.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.339
We also knew that we couldn't even
attempt to solve them

00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:37.339
by only focusing on Europe,

00:02:37.363 --> 00:02:41.583
a continent that represents less than
10 percent of the world population.

00:02:41.607 --> 00:02:44.134
The underlying issue
is that the way we see the world

00:02:44.158 --> 00:02:45.541
and the way the world works

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:46.828
are fundamentally wrong.

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.001
In the span of two generations,

00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:52.604
the world has changed more
than in the previous 20,000 years.

00:02:52.628 --> 00:02:54.055
We can land on the moon,

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.765
we can wake up in Shanghai
and go to bed in New York.

00:02:57.154 --> 00:03:01.373
We have access to a huge amount
of information all the time, everywhere.

00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:05.226
But we still see the world
as our immediate vicinity.

00:03:05.572 --> 00:03:09.172
But issues like COVID-19,
climate change, migration,

00:03:09.196 --> 00:03:11.410
fiscal justice or human rights

00:03:11.434 --> 00:03:15.328
mean that we need to think
and unite beyond national borders.

00:03:15.352 --> 00:03:17.697
A global approach is needed to solve them.

00:03:17.721 --> 00:03:19.170
Countries need to collaborate,

00:03:19.194 --> 00:03:21.857
share resources, information
and solutions.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.335
It's not just the right thing to do

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.101
but it's also the smart one.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.794
So in the weeks following
Damian's election,

00:03:28.818 --> 00:03:32.202
Andrea and I decided
that we would create a global movement

00:03:32.226 --> 00:03:33.995
to unite people beyond borders

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.426
and solve those issues
that concern us all.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.130
We called it NOW!
because we're not very creative,

00:03:39.154 --> 00:03:41.191
and because it needs to happen now.

00:03:41.215 --> 00:03:44.876
So I know that going beyond national
borders is not the easiest thing to do,

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.722
so here's the framework
that has been guiding our work.

00:03:47.746 --> 00:03:51.234
I call it "think, unite and leap forward."

00:03:51.258 --> 00:03:53.982
First, we need to change the way
we think about the world.

00:03:54.006 --> 00:03:55.264
Whether we like it or not,

00:03:55.288 --> 00:03:57.122
we already live in a globalized world.

00:03:57.146 --> 00:03:59.650
We need to stop thinking
within national frameworks

00:03:59.674 --> 00:04:01.667
and start thinking globally.

00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:04.124
Take, for example,
how we think about taxation.

00:04:04.684 --> 00:04:07.684
Multinational companies
like Facebook or Amazon

00:04:07.708 --> 00:04:10.026
already operate across borders,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.685
but they pay very little taxes
in very few countries

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.467
because we think of them
within national frameworks.

00:04:16.491 --> 00:04:17.641
And as a result,

00:04:17.665 --> 00:04:19.872
we lack a global tax system.

00:04:19.896 --> 00:04:21.223
Due to this,

00:04:21.247 --> 00:04:25.213
countries are deprived of at least
500 billion dollars annually.

00:04:25.876 --> 00:04:28.088
Five hundred billion dollars.

00:04:28.112 --> 00:04:29.420
To put it in perspective:

00:04:29.444 --> 00:04:31.130
with half of that amount of money,

00:04:31.154 --> 00:04:33.991
we could put an end
to global hunger for one year.

00:04:34.015 --> 00:04:35.571
But we don't,

00:04:35.595 --> 00:04:37.797
because of the way
we think about the world.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.317
At NOW! we want to change this.

00:04:41.341 --> 00:04:43.959
We connect people
from all across the world

00:04:43.983 --> 00:04:46.507
who discuss, work together and understand

00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:48.189
that global is the new normal

00:04:48.213 --> 00:04:50.979
and that they have more in common
than what separates them.

00:04:51.003 --> 00:04:52.902
We host weekly events

00:04:52.926 --> 00:04:56.303
in which we discuss topics
such as LGBT rights,

00:04:56.327 --> 00:04:57.478
pandemics,

00:04:57.502 --> 00:04:58.653
fiscal justice

00:04:58.677 --> 00:05:00.190
or mental health.

00:05:00.214 --> 00:05:02.192
We break down those global challenges

00:05:02.216 --> 00:05:05.298
to see how they impact people
in various parts of the world.

00:05:05.322 --> 00:05:08.059
And our members have
already shown a global thinking,

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:11.784
actively rallying their governments
to solve those issues,

00:05:11.808 --> 00:05:15.236
like ensuring a fair distribution
of vaccines across the world.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.234
Second, after changing the way we think,

00:05:17.258 --> 00:05:19.413
we need to unite beyond borders.

00:05:19.915 --> 00:05:23.173
This way, we can make governments
act on global issues.

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.137
Take the example of the erosion
of democracy in Hong Kong.

00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:31.131
China has systematically cracked down
on rights, democracy and freedoms,

00:05:31.155 --> 00:05:34.271
but countries have barely responded
to protect Hong Kongers.

00:05:34.735 --> 00:05:37.016
And I don't mean weak
statements of condemnation

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.568
that won't lead to any actual change,

00:05:39.592 --> 00:05:42.455
but proper responses such as sanctions.

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:44.913
That's why at NOW!,
a couple of weeks back,

00:05:44.937 --> 00:05:47.839
we launched a campaign
to demand that democracies rally

00:05:47.863 --> 00:05:50.369
to be able to stand up
meaningfully to China.

00:05:50.393 --> 00:05:52.193
And to get their attention,

00:05:52.217 --> 00:05:55.793
we started hosting weekly protests
in front of Chinese embassies.

00:05:56.105 --> 00:05:57.471
Within a couple of weeks,

00:05:57.495 --> 00:06:00.009
we engaged more than
a million people online.

00:06:00.495 --> 00:06:04.476
Our hope is that by uniting
and mobilizing people across borders,

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.924
we will be able
to successfully lobby nations

00:06:06.948 --> 00:06:09.797
into imposing coordinated
sanctions on China.

00:06:10.216 --> 00:06:13.273
Finally, we must have
the courage to leap forward

00:06:13.273 --> 00:06:15.747
to create the world of tomorrow.

00:06:15.747 --> 00:06:20.280
We need a system of governance
that works for us all across the world.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.918
And while some supernational institutions
like the United Nations exist,

00:06:24.942 --> 00:06:27.524
their enforcement mechanisms
are extremely limited.

00:06:27.924 --> 00:06:29.650
Citizens cannot participate,

00:06:29.674 --> 00:06:32.271
and national interests often prevail.

00:06:32.295 --> 00:06:33.629
And on the national level,

00:06:33.653 --> 00:06:37.694
political parties are bound
by electoral timetables and borders,

00:06:37.718 --> 00:06:41.348
which means that they cannot operate
in a coordinated global manner.

00:06:42.058 --> 00:06:46.919
Policy making, governance and politics
need to stretch further.

00:06:46.943 --> 00:06:50.180
Take the example of the response
to the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:55.298
Countries have shown an incredibly
shortsighted approach to the pandemic.

00:06:55.322 --> 00:06:58.348
They haven't collaborated
when it comes to protective equipment,

00:06:58.372 --> 00:07:00.596
vaccines or medicines.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.379
At NOW! we launched a campaign

00:07:02.403 --> 00:07:05.058
demanding that the World Health
Organization ensures

00:07:05.082 --> 00:07:08.622
that health workers across the world,
regardless of their nationalities,

00:07:08.646 --> 00:07:12.053
get priority access
to future COVID-19 vaccines.

00:07:12.077 --> 00:07:15.816
We leveraged a network of doctors
on social media to raise awareness

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.099
and started a petition
targeted at the WHO.

00:07:19.591 --> 00:07:20.742
For two weeks,

00:07:20.766 --> 00:07:24.656
our members spread the word
digitally and on the streets,

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.728
and then we got a response
from the Director-General of the WHO

00:07:28.752 --> 00:07:30.411
welcoming our campaign,

00:07:30.435 --> 00:07:33.964
reemphasizing that the power to do so
lies within member states,

00:07:33.988 --> 00:07:36.772
but committing to working
with them in that direction.

00:07:36.796 --> 00:07:40.781
And look -- this was a very nice letter,
but it was completely pointless.

00:07:40.805 --> 00:07:44.050
The WHO cannot act
meaningfully on this issue.

00:07:44.653 --> 00:07:45.804
But the point is,

00:07:45.828 --> 00:07:49.328
a United Nations agency should
be able to act meaningfully,

00:07:49.352 --> 00:07:52.431
should be able to create binding policies
and implement them

00:07:52.455 --> 00:07:54.341
when faced with a global threat.

00:07:55.063 --> 00:07:57.498
Right now, the most we can hope for

00:07:57.522 --> 00:08:00.082
is for some world leaders
to hear our scream

00:08:00.106 --> 00:08:02.122
and decide to do the right thing.

00:08:02.146 --> 00:08:03.765
This cannot continue.

00:08:03.789 --> 00:08:05.871
In the globalized world,

00:08:05.895 --> 00:08:10.547
we need a true democratic and accountable
global system of governance.

00:08:10.571 --> 00:08:12.620
And that's also what
we're working towards,

00:08:12.644 --> 00:08:15.499
but I know that global governance
will not happen overnight.

00:08:15.523 --> 00:08:17.899
For this, we need people
to push their governments

00:08:17.923 --> 00:08:19.449
to act in a global manner,

00:08:19.473 --> 00:08:22.198
to show that collaboration
leads to better results.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:23.921
We need to prove the case

00:08:23.945 --> 00:08:26.352
before we can change
the way the world works.

00:08:26.376 --> 00:08:28.582
So this is my framework:

00:08:28.606 --> 00:08:30.731
think beyond national borders,

00:08:30.755 --> 00:08:32.459
unite across the world

00:08:32.483 --> 00:08:36.178
and leap forward to make sure
that the world actually works as one.

00:08:36.202 --> 00:08:38.131
And I know it is easier said than done,

00:08:38.155 --> 00:08:39.331
but it is doable.

00:08:39.786 --> 00:08:41.374
Take our case as an example.

00:08:41.749 --> 00:08:45.352
NOW! was only launched
on the first of January 2020

00:08:45.376 --> 00:08:49.467
but already counts thousands of members
in more than 100 countries.

00:08:49.491 --> 00:08:52.721
We are beginning to see that it
is possible to unite beyond borders,

00:08:52.745 --> 00:08:54.672
that it is within our reach.

00:08:54.696 --> 00:08:57.804
And we're not special,
nor am I in any way.

00:08:57.828 --> 00:08:59.267
I don't have any cool skills,

00:08:59.291 --> 00:09:01.746
and the thought of giving
this talk terrified me.

00:09:02.166 --> 00:09:06.079
But I am testing different ways
to effect change on a global scale

00:09:06.103 --> 00:09:09.068
because I know that national mindsets
and national frameworks

00:09:09.092 --> 00:09:11.543
have to leave room for something bigger,

00:09:11.567 --> 00:09:12.971
for something better.

00:09:12.995 --> 00:09:15.233
My hope is that within my lifetime,

00:09:15.257 --> 00:09:19.051
I will see what living
as one world actually means,

00:09:19.075 --> 00:09:20.266
that by uniting,

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.413
we will be able to safeguard democracy,

00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:24.027
to protect the environment,

00:09:24.051 --> 00:09:26.587
to save lives by sharing vaccines,

00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:28.942
to create safer routes for migration,

00:09:28.966 --> 00:09:31.023
among many other achievements.

00:09:31.047 --> 00:09:33.312
I don't know whether
I have the one solution --

00:09:33.336 --> 00:09:34.839
no one does.

00:09:34.863 --> 00:09:37.013
I don't know whether
NOW! will be successful

00:09:37.037 --> 00:09:38.786
in achieving these goals.

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:40.591
But this is not the point.

00:09:40.615 --> 00:09:44.337
The point is that you should take action
to effect change on the global scale.

00:09:44.702 --> 00:09:48.262
My hope is that many of you will
start to work together across borders,

00:09:48.286 --> 00:09:52.311
that you will create and innovate
new ways for the world to be truly one.

00:09:52.335 --> 00:09:55.203
Because yes, we are stronger together.

00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:57.105
So what are we waiting for?

00:09:57.908 --> 00:09:59.058
Thank you.
