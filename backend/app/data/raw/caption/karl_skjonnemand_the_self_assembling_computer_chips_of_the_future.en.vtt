00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:16.830
Computers used to be as big as a room.

00:00:16.854 --> 00:00:18.446
But now they fit in your pocket,

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.641
on your wrist

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:22.984
and can even be implanted
inside of your body.

00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:24.289
How cool is that?

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:29.146
And this has been enabled
by the miniaturization of transistors,

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.662
which are the tiny switches
in the circuits

00:00:31.686 --> 00:00:33.462
at the heart of our computers.

00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:37.223
And it's been achieved
through decades of development

00:00:37.247 --> 00:00:40.045
and breakthroughs
in science and engineering

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:42.741
and of billions of dollars of investment.

00:00:43.352 --> 00:00:46.100
But it's given us
vast amounts of computing,

00:00:46.124 --> 00:00:47.929
huge amounts of memory

00:00:47.953 --> 00:00:52.895
and the digital revolution
that we all experience and enjoy today.

00:00:53.665 --> 00:00:56.433
But the bad news is,

00:00:56.457 --> 00:00:59.589
we're about to hit a digital roadblock,

00:00:59.613 --> 00:01:03.963
as the rate of miniaturization
of transistors is slowing down.

00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:07.345
And this is happening
at exactly the same time

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.367
as our innovation in software
is continuing relentlessly

00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:15.151
with artificial intelligence and big data.

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:20.215
And our devices regularly perform
facial recognition or augment our reality

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:24.464
or even drive cars down
our treacherous, chaotic roads.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.166
It's amazing.

00:01:26.618 --> 00:01:31.285
But if we don't keep up
with the appetite of our software,

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:35.096
we could reach a point
in the development of our technology

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.330
where the things that we could do
with software could, in fact, be limited

00:01:39.354 --> 00:01:40.625
by our hardware.

00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:45.583
We've all experienced the frustration
of an old smartphone or tablet

00:01:45.607 --> 00:01:48.771
grinding slowly to a halt over time

00:01:48.795 --> 00:01:52.770
under the ever-increasing weight
of software updates and new features.

00:01:52.794 --> 00:01:56.177
And it worked just fine
when we bought it not so long ago.

00:01:56.201 --> 00:02:00.711
But the hungry software engineers
have eaten up all the hardware capacity

00:02:00.735 --> 00:02:02.041
over time.

00:02:03.883 --> 00:02:07.495
The semiconductor industry
is very well aware of this

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:11.403
and is working on
all sorts of creative solutions,

00:02:11.427 --> 00:02:15.738
such as going beyond transistors
to quantum computing

00:02:15.762 --> 00:02:19.974
or even working with transistors
in alternative architectures

00:02:19.998 --> 00:02:21.601
such as neural networks

00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:24.638
to make more robust
and efficient circuits.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.609
But these approaches
will take quite some time,

00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:33.260
and we're really looking for a much more
immediate solution to this problem.

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:39.681
The reason why the rate of miniaturization
of transistors is slowing down

00:02:39.705 --> 00:02:44.391
is due to the ever-increasing complexity
of the manufacturing process.

00:02:45.142 --> 00:02:48.392
The transistor used to be
a big, bulky device,

00:02:48.416 --> 00:02:51.725
until the invent of the integrated circuit

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:54.440
based on pure crystalline silicon wafers.

00:02:54.946 --> 00:02:57.725
And after 50 years
of continuous development,

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:01.122
we can now achieve
transistor features dimensions

00:03:01.146 --> 00:03:03.675
down to 10 nanometers.

00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:06.798
You can fit more than
a billion transistors

00:03:06.822 --> 00:03:09.785
in a single square millimeter of silicon.

00:03:10.273 --> 00:03:12.295
And to put this into perspective:

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.145
a human hair is 100 microns across.

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.688
A red blood cell,
which is essentially invisible,

00:03:18.712 --> 00:03:20.311
is eight microns across,

00:03:20.335 --> 00:03:23.735
and you can place 12 across
the width of a human hair.

00:03:24.467 --> 00:03:27.567
But a transistor, in comparison,
is much smaller,

00:03:27.591 --> 00:03:31.439
at a tiny fraction of a micron across.

00:03:31.463 --> 00:03:35.009
You could place more than 260 transistors

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:37.011
across a single red blood cell

00:03:37.035 --> 00:03:41.499
or more than 3,000 across
the width of a human hair.

00:03:41.523 --> 00:03:45.847
It really is incredible nanotechnology
in your pocket right now.

00:03:47.204 --> 00:03:49.392
And besides the obvious benefit

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:53.250
of being able to place more,
smaller transistors on a chip,

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:57.476
smaller transistors are faster switches,

00:03:58.166 --> 00:04:02.567
and smaller transistors are also
more efficient switches.

00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:05.068
So this combination has given us

00:04:05.092 --> 00:04:09.391
lower cost, higher performance
and higher efficiency electronics

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:11.478
that we all enjoy today.

00:04:14.415 --> 00:04:17.179
To manufacture these integrated circuits,

00:04:17.203 --> 00:04:20.411
the transistors are built up
layer by layer,

00:04:20.435 --> 00:04:22.788
on a pure crystalline silicon wafer.

00:04:23.332 --> 00:04:25.560
And in an oversimplified sense,

00:04:25.584 --> 00:04:29.865
every tiny feature
of the circuit is projected

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.221
onto the surface of the silicon wafer

00:04:32.245 --> 00:04:35.924
and recorded in a light-sensitive material

00:04:35.948 --> 00:04:38.887
and then etched through
the light-sensitive material

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:41.932
to leave the pattern
in the underlying layers.

00:04:42.612 --> 00:04:46.696
And this process has been
dramatically improved over the years

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.493
to give the electronics
performance we have today.

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:53.721
But as the transistor features
get smaller and smaller,

00:04:53.745 --> 00:04:56.782
we're really approaching
the physical limitations

00:04:56.806 --> 00:04:58.689
of this manufacturing technique.

00:05:00.515 --> 00:05:03.620
The latest systems
for doing this patterning

00:05:03.644 --> 00:05:05.947
have become so complex

00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:10.701
that they reportedly cost
more than 100 million dollars each.

00:05:10.725 --> 00:05:15.012
And semiconductor factories
contain dozens of these machines.

00:05:15.036 --> 00:05:19.462
So people are seriously questioning:
Is this approach long-term viable?

00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:24.121
But we believe we can do
this chip manufacturing

00:05:24.145 --> 00:05:28.168
in a totally different
and much more cost-effective way

00:05:28.966 --> 00:05:32.939
using molecular engineering
and mimicking nature

00:05:32.963 --> 00:05:36.576
down at the nanoscale dimensions
of our transistors.

00:05:37.267 --> 00:05:41.928
As I said, the conventional manufacturing
takes every tiny feature of the circuit

00:05:41.952 --> 00:05:44.076
and projects it onto the silicon.

00:05:44.818 --> 00:05:47.562
But if you look at the structure
of an integrated circuit,

00:05:47.586 --> 00:05:49.560
the transistor arrays,

00:05:49.584 --> 00:05:53.213
many of the features are repeated
millions of times.

00:05:53.237 --> 00:05:55.845
It's a highly periodic structure.

00:05:56.331 --> 00:05:59.399
So we want to take advantage
of this periodicity

00:05:59.423 --> 00:06:02.120
in our alternative
manufacturing technique.

00:06:02.144 --> 00:06:05.579
We want to use self-assembling materials

00:06:05.603 --> 00:06:08.580
to naturally form the periodic structures

00:06:08.604 --> 00:06:10.987
that we need for our transistors.

00:06:12.052 --> 00:06:14.194
We do this with the materials,

00:06:14.218 --> 00:06:17.655
then the materials do the hard work
of the fine patterning,

00:06:17.679 --> 00:06:22.538
rather than pushing the projection
technology to its limits and beyond.

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:27.808
Self-assembly is seen in nature
in many different places,

00:06:27.832 --> 00:06:31.242
from lipid membranes to cell structures,

00:06:31.266 --> 00:06:34.321
so we do know it can be a robust solution.

00:06:34.345 --> 00:06:37.906
If it's good enough for nature,
it should be good enough for us.

00:06:38.549 --> 00:06:43.349
So we want to take this naturally
occurring, robust self-assembly

00:06:43.373 --> 00:06:47.338
and use it for the manufacturing
of our semiconductor technology.

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:51.544
One type of self-assemble material --

00:06:52.388 --> 00:06:54.635
it's called a block co-polymer --

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:59.442
consists of two polymer chains
just a few tens of nanometers in length.

00:06:59.466 --> 00:07:01.517
But these chains hate each other.

00:07:01.541 --> 00:07:03.025
They repel each other,

00:07:03.049 --> 00:07:06.946
very much like oil and water
or my teenage son and daughter.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.327
(Laughter)

00:07:08.351 --> 00:07:11.125
But we cruelly bond them together,

00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:13.844
creating an inbuilt
frustration in the system,

00:07:13.868 --> 00:07:16.074
as they try to separate from each other.

00:07:16.716 --> 00:07:20.001
And in the bulk material,
there are billions of these,

00:07:20.025 --> 00:07:23.326
and the similar components
try to stick together,

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.159
and the opposing components
try to separate from each other

00:07:26.183 --> 00:07:27.338
at the same time.

00:07:27.362 --> 00:07:31.116
And this has a built-in frustration,
a tension in the system.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.449
So it moves around, it squirms
until a shape is formed.

00:07:36.209 --> 00:07:40.257
And the natural self-assembled shape
that is formed is nanoscale,

00:07:40.281 --> 00:07:44.008
it's regular, it's periodic,
and it's long range,

00:07:44.032 --> 00:07:47.890
which is exactly what we need
for our transistor arrays.

00:07:49.347 --> 00:07:51.878
So we can use molecular engineering

00:07:51.902 --> 00:07:54.966
to design different shapes
of different sizes

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.053
and of different periodicities.

00:07:57.077 --> 00:07:59.808
So for example, if we take
a symmetrical molecule,

00:07:59.832 --> 00:08:02.907
where the two polymer chains
are similar length,

00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:05.602
the natural self-assembled
structure that is formed

00:08:05.626 --> 00:08:08.555
is a long, meandering line,

00:08:08.579 --> 00:08:10.389
very much like a fingerprint.

00:08:10.951 --> 00:08:13.273
And the width of the fingerprint lines

00:08:13.297 --> 00:08:15.307
and the distance between them

00:08:15.331 --> 00:08:19.242
is determined by the lengths
of our polymer chains

00:08:19.266 --> 00:08:22.560
but also the level of built-in
frustration in the system.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.878
And we can even create
more elaborate structures

00:08:27.487 --> 00:08:29.926
if we use unsymmetrical molecules,

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:34.924
where one polymer chain
is significantly shorter than the other.

00:08:35.749 --> 00:08:38.459
And the self-assembled structure
that forms in this case

00:08:38.483 --> 00:08:42.283
is with the shorter chains
forming a tight ball in the middle,

00:08:42.307 --> 00:08:46.148
and it's surrounded by the longer,
opposing polymer chains,

00:08:46.172 --> 00:08:48.220
forming a natural cylinder.

00:08:49.089 --> 00:08:51.164
And the size of this cylinder

00:08:51.188 --> 00:08:54.603
and the distance between
the cylinders, the periodicity,

00:08:54.627 --> 00:08:58.221
is again determined by how long
we make the polymer chains

00:08:58.245 --> 00:09:00.983
and the level of built-in frustration.

00:09:01.896 --> 00:09:05.774
So in other words, we're using
molecular engineering

00:09:05.798 --> 00:09:08.623
to self-assemble nanoscale structures

00:09:08.647 --> 00:09:13.557
that can be lines or cylinders
the size and periodicity of our design.

00:09:14.369 --> 00:09:17.666
We're using chemistry,
chemical engineering,

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:22.479
to manufacture the nanoscale features
that we need for our transistors.

00:09:25.611 --> 00:09:29.660
But the ability
to self-assemble these structures

00:09:29.684 --> 00:09:32.121
only takes us half of the way,

00:09:32.145 --> 00:09:34.954
because we still need
to position these structures

00:09:34.978 --> 00:09:38.528
where we want the transistors
in the integrated circuit.

00:09:39.246 --> 00:09:41.984
But we can do this relatively easily

00:09:42.008 --> 00:09:48.985
using wide guide structures that pin down
the self-assembled structures,

00:09:49.009 --> 00:09:50.930
anchoring them in place

00:09:50.954 --> 00:09:53.801
and forcing the rest
of the self-assembled structures

00:09:53.825 --> 00:09:55.175
to lie parallel,

00:09:55.199 --> 00:09:57.599
aligned with our guide structure.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:03.149
For example, if we want to make
a fine, 40-nanometer line,

00:10:03.173 --> 00:10:07.311
which is very difficult to manufacture
with conventional projection technology,

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:13.059
we can manufacture
a 120-nanometer guide structure

00:10:13.083 --> 00:10:15.587
with normal projection technology,

00:10:15.611 --> 00:10:22.202
and this structure will align three
of the 40-nanometer lines in between.

00:10:22.226 --> 00:10:26.995
So the materials are doing
the most difficult fine patterning.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:31.697
And we call this whole approach
"directed self-assembly."

00:10:33.586 --> 00:10:36.340
The challenge with directed self-assembly

00:10:36.364 --> 00:10:40.840
is that the whole system
needs to align almost perfectly,

00:10:40.864 --> 00:10:46.145
because any tiny defect in the structure
could cause a transistor failure.

00:10:46.169 --> 00:10:49.138
And because there are billions
of transistors in our circuit,

00:10:49.162 --> 00:10:52.390
we need an almost
molecularly perfect system.

00:10:52.977 --> 00:10:54.982
But we're going to extraordinary measures

00:10:55.006 --> 00:10:56.173
to achieve this,

00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:59.189
from the cleanliness of our chemistry

00:10:59.213 --> 00:11:01.539
to the careful processing
of these materials

00:11:01.563 --> 00:11:03.134
in the semiconductor factory

00:11:03.158 --> 00:11:07.730
to remove even the smallest
nanoscopic defects.

00:11:09.311 --> 00:11:14.501
So directed self-assembly
is an exciting new disruptive technology,

00:11:14.525 --> 00:11:17.094
but it is still in the development stage.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.541
But we're growing in confidence
that we could, in fact, introduce it

00:11:21.565 --> 00:11:23.252
to the semiconductor industry

00:11:23.276 --> 00:11:26.233
as a revolutionary new
manufacturing process

00:11:26.257 --> 00:11:28.324
in just the next few years.

00:11:29.014 --> 00:11:32.048
And if we can do this,
if we're successful,

00:11:32.072 --> 00:11:33.603
we'll be able to continue

00:11:33.627 --> 00:11:36.885
with the cost-effective
miniaturization of transistors,

00:11:36.909 --> 00:11:40.662
continue with the spectacular
expansion of computing

00:11:40.686 --> 00:11:42.568
and the digital revolution.

00:11:42.592 --> 00:11:46.137
And what's more, this could even
be the dawn of a new era

00:11:46.161 --> 00:11:48.392
of molecular manufacturing.

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:49.947
How cool is that?

00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:51.677
Thank you.

00:11:51.701 --> 00:11:55.910
(Applause)
