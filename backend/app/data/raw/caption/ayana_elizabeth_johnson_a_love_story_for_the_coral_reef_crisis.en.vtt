00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:15.642
I want to tell you a love story.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.524
But it doesn't have a happy ending.

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:23.029
Once upon a time,
I was a stubborn five-year-old

00:00:23.053 --> 00:00:26.053
who decided to become a marine biologist.

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:30.990
Thirty-four years, 400 scuba dives
and one PhD later,

00:00:31.014 --> 00:00:34.180
I'm still completely
enamored with the ocean.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.387
I spent a decade working
with fishing communities

00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:38.593
in the Caribbean,

00:00:38.617 --> 00:00:41.012
counting fish, interviewing fishermen,

00:00:41.036 --> 00:00:44.551
redesigning fishing gear
and developing policy.

00:00:44.957 --> 00:00:49.012
I've been helping to figure out
what sustainable management can look like

00:00:49.036 --> 00:00:52.680
for places where food security,
jobs and cultures

00:00:52.704 --> 00:00:54.585
all depend on the sea.

00:00:55.538 --> 00:00:58.942
In the midst of all this, I fell in love.

00:00:59.628 --> 00:01:00.953
With a fish.

00:01:01.675 --> 00:01:05.287
There are over 500 fish species
that live on Caribbean reefs,

00:01:05.311 --> 00:01:08.540
but the ones I just
can't get out of my head

00:01:08.564 --> 00:01:09.746
are parrotfish.

00:01:10.093 --> 00:01:12.641
Parrotfish live on coral reefs
all over the world,

00:01:12.665 --> 00:01:14.434
there are 100 species,

00:01:14.458 --> 00:01:16.264
they can grow well over a meter long

00:01:16.288 --> 00:01:17.911
and weigh over 20 kilograms,

00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:20.077
but that's the boring stuff.

00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:23.783
I want to tell you five
incredible things about these fish.

00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:27.315
First, they have a mouth
like a parrot's beak,

00:01:27.339 --> 00:01:29.117
which is strong enough to bite coral,

00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:31.672
although mostly they're after algae.

00:01:31.696 --> 00:01:33.887
They are the lawn mowers of the reef.

00:01:33.911 --> 00:01:37.700
This is key, because many reefs
are overgrown with algae

00:01:37.724 --> 00:01:41.009
due to nutrient pollution
from sewage and fertilizer

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:42.500
that runs off of land.

00:01:42.842 --> 00:01:45.502
And there just aren't enough
herbivores like parrotfish

00:01:45.526 --> 00:01:46.700
left out on the reefs

00:01:46.724 --> 00:01:48.223
to mow it all down.

00:01:48.932 --> 00:01:51.290
OK, second amazing thing.

00:01:51.314 --> 00:01:56.399
After all that eating,
they poop fine white sand.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.639
A single parrotfish can produce
over 380 kilograms

00:02:00.663 --> 00:02:02.996
of this pulverized coral each year.

00:02:03.371 --> 00:02:04.956
Sometimes, when scuba diving,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.895
I would look up from my clipboard

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:11.059
and just see contrails
of parrotfish poop raining down.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.202
So next time you're lounging
on a tropical white-sand beach,

00:02:16.226 --> 00:02:18.543
maybe thank of parrotfish.

00:02:18.567 --> 00:02:19.718
(Laughter)

00:02:19.742 --> 00:02:22.686
Third, they have so much style.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.994
Mottled and striped,
teal, magenta,

00:02:25.018 --> 00:02:27.159
yellow, orange, polka-dotted,

00:02:27.183 --> 00:02:30.746
parrotfish are a big part
of what makes coral reefs so colorful.

00:02:31.212 --> 00:02:33.565
Plus, in true diva style,

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:37.128
they have multiple wardrobe changes
throughout their life.

00:02:37.473 --> 00:02:38.631
A juvenile outfit,

00:02:38.655 --> 00:02:39.949
an intermediate getup,

00:02:39.973 --> 00:02:41.306
and a terminal look.

00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:47.058
Fourth, with this last wardrobe change
comes a sex change from female to male,

00:02:47.082 --> 00:02:49.939
termed sequential hermaphroditism.

00:02:50.252 --> 00:02:54.172
These large males then gather
harems of females to spawn.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.391
Heterosexual monogamy
is certainly not nature's status quo.

00:02:58.415 --> 00:03:01.216
And parrotfish exemplify
some of the beauty

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.574
of diverse reproductive strategies.

00:03:04.088 --> 00:03:07.358
Fifth, and the most incredible,

00:03:07.382 --> 00:03:11.310
sometimes when parrotfish
cozy up into a nook in the reef at night,

00:03:11.334 --> 00:03:15.093
they secrete a mucus bubble
from a gland in their head

00:03:15.117 --> 00:03:17.728
that envelops their entire body.

00:03:18.752 --> 00:03:20.950
This masks their scent from predators

00:03:20.974 --> 00:03:22.562
and protects them from parasites,

00:03:22.586 --> 00:03:23.880
so they can sleep soundly.

00:03:23.904 --> 00:03:25.913
I mean, how cool is this?

00:03:25.937 --> 00:03:27.926
(Laughter)

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.721
So this is a confession
of my love for parrotfish

00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:33.434
in all their flamboyant,

00:03:33.458 --> 00:03:36.689
algae-eating, sand-pooping,
sex-changing glory.

00:03:36.713 --> 00:03:37.808
(Laughter)

00:03:37.832 --> 00:03:41.887
But with this love comes heartache.

00:03:42.832 --> 00:03:46.475
Now that groupers and snappers
are woefully overfished,

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:48.912
fishermen are targeting parrotfish.

00:03:48.936 --> 00:03:51.348
Spearfishing took out the large species,

00:03:51.372 --> 00:03:55.650
midnight blue and rainbow parrotfish
are now exceedingly rare,

00:03:55.674 --> 00:03:58.974
and nets and traps are scooping up
the smaller species.

00:03:58.998 --> 00:04:02.677
As both a marine biologist
and a single person,

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:03.939
I can tell you,

00:04:03.963 --> 00:04:06.413
there aren't that many fish in the sea.

00:04:06.437 --> 00:04:07.534
(Laughter)

00:04:07.558 --> 00:04:10.724
And then, there's my love for their home,

00:04:10.748 --> 00:04:11.923
the coral reef,

00:04:11.947 --> 00:04:15.393
which was once as vibrant
as Caribbean cultures,

00:04:15.417 --> 00:04:17.448
as colorful as the architecture,

00:04:17.472 --> 00:04:19.339
and as bustling as carnival.

00:04:19.671 --> 00:04:21.369
Because of climate change,

00:04:21.393 --> 00:04:24.236
on top of overfishing and pollution,

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.879
coral reefs may be gone within 30 years.

00:04:28.903 --> 00:04:31.827
An entire ecosystem erased.

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:33.346
This is devastating,

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.694
because hundreds of millions
of people around the world

00:04:37.718 --> 00:04:41.560
depend on reefs
for their nutrition and income.

00:04:41.584 --> 00:04:43.210
Let that sink in.

00:04:44.998 --> 00:04:46.815
A little bit of good news

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:52.441
is that places like Belize, Barbuda
and Bonaire are protecting these VIPs --

00:04:52.465 --> 00:04:54.560
Very Important Parrotfish.

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:59.012
Also, more and more places
are establishing protected areas

00:04:59.036 --> 00:05:01.663
that protect the entire ecosystem.

00:05:02.044 --> 00:05:05.345
These are critical efforts,
but it's not enough.

00:05:06.163 --> 00:05:08.036
As I stand here today,

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.568
only 2.2 percent
of the ocean is protected.

00:05:11.956 --> 00:05:14.717
Meanwhile, 90 percent of the large fish,

00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:17.805
and 80 percent
of the coral on Caribbean reefs,

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:19.670
is already gone.

00:05:20.323 --> 00:05:22.903
We're in the midst
of the sixth mass extinction.

00:05:22.927 --> 00:05:26.272
And we, humans, are causing it.

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:29.616
We also have the solutions.

00:05:30.061 --> 00:05:33.037
Reverse climate change and overfishing,

00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:34.553
protect half the ocean

00:05:34.577 --> 00:05:36.549
and stop pollution running from land.

00:05:36.573 --> 00:05:38.831
But these are massive undertakings

00:05:38.855 --> 00:05:40.966
requiring systemic changes,

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.224
and we're really taking our sweet time
getting around to it.

00:05:44.784 --> 00:05:47.050
Each of us can contribute, though.

00:05:47.498 --> 00:05:50.212
With our votes, our voices,
our food choices,

00:05:50.236 --> 00:05:52.149
our skills and our dollars.

00:05:52.173 --> 00:05:55.149
We must overhaul both corporate practices

00:05:55.173 --> 00:05:56.577
and government policies.

00:05:56.601 --> 00:05:59.197
We must transform culture.

00:06:00.046 --> 00:06:02.808
Building community around solutions

00:06:02.832 --> 00:06:05.166
is the most important thing.

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:08.729
I am never going to give up

00:06:08.753 --> 00:06:12.268
working to protect and restore
this magnificent planet.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.387
Every bit of habitat we preserve,

00:06:16.411 --> 00:06:19.609
every tenth of a degree
of warming we prevent,

00:06:19.633 --> 00:06:21.331
really does matter.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.534
Thankfully, I'm not motivated by hope,

00:06:24.558 --> 00:06:26.758
but rather a desire to be useful.

00:06:27.558 --> 00:06:31.690
Because I don't know
how to give an honest talk

00:06:31.714 --> 00:06:35.087
about my beloved parrotfish
and coral reefs

00:06:35.111 --> 00:06:36.711
that has a happy ending.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.191
Thank you.

00:06:38.215 --> 00:06:41.213
(Applause)
