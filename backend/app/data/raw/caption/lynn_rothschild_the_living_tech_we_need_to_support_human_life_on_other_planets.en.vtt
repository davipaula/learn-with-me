00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:16.643
For thousands of years,
well, really probably millions of years,

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:20.684
our ancestors have looked up at the sky
and wondered what's up there,

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:23.559
and they've also started to wonder,

00:00:23.583 --> 00:00:26.917
hmm, could we be alone in this planet?

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:33.601
Now, I'm fortunate that I get to get paid
to actually ask some of those questions,

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:35.059
and sort of bad news for you,

00:00:35.083 --> 00:00:38.518
your tax dollars are paying me
to try to answer some of those questions.

00:00:38.542 --> 00:00:40.059
But then, about 10 years ago,

00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:42.893
I was told, I mean asked,

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:46.726
if I would start to look at the technology
to help get us off planet,

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.768
and so that's what I'm going
to talk to you about today.

00:00:49.792 --> 00:00:51.601
So playing to the local crowd,

00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:55.226
this is what it looks like
in your day-to-day life in Boston,

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.292
but as you start to go off planet,
things look very, very different.

00:01:00.542 --> 00:01:03.917
So there we are,
hovering above the WGBH studios.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.393
And here's a very famous picture
of the Earthrise from the Moon,

00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:11.958
and you can see the Earth
starting to recede.

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:15.184
And then what I love is this picture

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:18.351
that was taken from the surface of Mars
looking back at the Earth.

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:19.667
Can anyone find the Earth?

00:01:21.042 --> 00:01:22.750
I'm going to help you out a little.

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:25.559
(Laughter)

00:01:25.583 --> 00:01:26.851
Yeah.

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:30.434
The point of showing this
is that when people start to go to Mars,

00:01:30.458 --> 00:01:32.684
they're not going to be able
to keep calling in

00:01:32.708 --> 00:01:35.851
and be micromanaged
the way people on a space station are.

00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:37.976
They're going to have to be independent.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.559
So even though they're up there,

00:01:39.583 --> 00:01:42.851
there are going to be all sorts of things
that they're going to need,

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:46.351
just like people on Earth
need things like, oh, transportation,

00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:49.893
life support, food, clothing and so on.

00:01:49.917 --> 00:01:52.851
But unlike on Earth,
they are also going to need oxygen.

00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:56.768
They're going to have to deal with about
a third of the gravity that we have here.

00:01:56.792 --> 00:01:59.934
They're going to have to worry
about habitats, power, heat, light

00:01:59.958 --> 00:02:01.518
and radiation protection,

00:02:01.542 --> 00:02:05.018
something that we don't actually
worry about nearly as much on the Earth,

00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:08.768
because we have this beautiful
atmosphere and magnetosphere.

00:02:08.792 --> 00:02:13.143
The problem with that is
that we also have a lot of constraints.

00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:16.184
So the biggest one for us is upmass,

00:02:16.208 --> 00:02:18.101
and the number that I've used for years

00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:23.684
is it costs about 10,000 dollars to launch
a can of Coke into low Earth orbit.

00:02:23.708 --> 00:02:26.559
The problem is, there you are
with 10,000 dollars later,

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:28.351
and you're still in low Earth orbit.

00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:31.643
You're not even at the Moon
or Mars or anything else.

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:34.851
So you're going to have to
try to figure out

00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:38.958
how to keep the mass as low as possible
so you don't have to launch it.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:43.268
But on top of that cost issue
with the mass,

00:02:43.292 --> 00:02:46.309
you also have problems of storage

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:48.851
and flexibility and reliability.

00:02:48.875 --> 00:02:53.143
You can't just get there and say,
"Oops, I forgot to bring,"

00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:57.018
because Amazon.com
just does not deliver to Mars.

00:02:57.042 --> 00:02:59.417
So you better be prepared.

00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:02.976
So what is the solution for this?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.018
And I'm going to propose to you
for the rest of this talk

00:03:06.042 --> 00:03:09.018
that the solution actually is life,

00:03:09.042 --> 00:03:11.643
and when you start to look
at life as a technology,

00:03:11.667 --> 00:03:13.893
you realize, ah, that's it,

00:03:13.917 --> 00:03:15.851
that's exactly what we needed.

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:18.893
This plant here, like every person here

00:03:18.917 --> 00:03:20.976
and every one of your dogs and cats

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.768
and plants and so on,

00:03:22.792 --> 00:03:24.976
all started as a single cell.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.559
So imagine, you're starting
as a very low upmass object

00:03:29.583 --> 00:03:32.000
and then growing into something
a good deal bigger.

00:03:34.375 --> 00:03:37.309
Now, my hero Charles Darwin,

00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:41.934
of course, reminds us that there's
no such thing as a designer in biology,

00:03:41.958 --> 00:03:46.351
but what if we now have the technology

00:03:46.375 --> 00:03:48.268
to design biology,

00:03:48.292 --> 00:03:52.559
maybe even design,
oh, whole new life-forms

00:03:52.583 --> 00:03:56.518
that can do things for us
that we couldn't have imagined otherwise?

00:03:56.542 --> 00:04:00.934
So years ago, I was asked
to start to sell this program,

00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:02.518
and while I was doing that,

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:06.601
I was put in front of a panel at NASA,

00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:08.934
as you might sort of imagine,

00:04:08.958 --> 00:04:12.934
a bunch of people in suits
and white shirts and pencil protectors,

00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:15.184
and I did this sort of crazy, wild,

00:04:15.208 --> 00:04:17.476
"This is all the next great thing,"

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.559
and I thought they would be blown over,

00:04:19.583 --> 00:04:23.393
and instead the chairman of the committee
just looked at me straight in the eye,

00:04:23.417 --> 00:04:26.476
and said, "So what's the big idea?"

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.684
So I was like, "OK, you want Star Trek?

00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:29.976
We'll do Star Trek."

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.333
And so let me tell you
what the big idea is.

00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:37.184
We've used organisms
to make biomaterials for years.

00:04:37.208 --> 00:04:41.268
So here's a great picture
taken outside of Glasgow,

00:04:41.292 --> 00:04:43.809
and you can see lots
of great biomaterials there.

00:04:43.833 --> 00:04:46.393
There are trees that you could
use to build houses.

00:04:46.417 --> 00:04:50.059
There are sheep where you
can get your wool from.

00:04:50.083 --> 00:04:52.018
You could get leather from the sheep.

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:55.601
Just quickly glancing around the room,
I'll bet there's no one in this room

00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:58.601
that doesn't have some kind of animal
or plant product on them,

00:04:58.625 --> 00:04:59.976
some kind of biomaterial.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.309
But you know what?

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:04.434
We're not going to take sheep
and trees and stuff to Mars.

00:05:04.458 --> 00:05:06.500
That's nuts, because
of the upmass problem.

00:05:07.208 --> 00:05:09.518
But we are going to take things like this.

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:11.143
This is Bacillus subtilis.

00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:13.518
Those white dots that you see are spores.

00:05:13.542 --> 00:05:17.559
This happens to be a bacterium
that can form incredibly resistant spores,

00:05:17.583 --> 00:05:21.018
and when I say incredibly resistant,
they've proven themselves.

00:05:21.042 --> 00:05:24.559
Bacillus subtilis spores have been flown
on what was called LDEF,

00:05:24.583 --> 00:05:28.143
Long Duration Exposure Facility,
for almost six years

00:05:28.167 --> 00:05:30.518
and some of them survived that in space.

00:05:30.542 --> 00:05:33.434
Unbelievable, a lot better
than any of us can do.

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:37.143
So why not just take the capabilities,

00:05:37.167 --> 00:05:41.018
like to make wood or to make wool
or spider silk or whatever,

00:05:41.042 --> 00:05:43.476
and put them in Bacillus subtilis spores,

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.768
and take those with you off planet?

00:05:47.792 --> 00:05:50.226
So what are you going to do
when you're off planet?

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.143
Here's an iconic picture of Buzz Aldrin
looking back at the Eagle

00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:58.643
when he landed, oh, it was almost
50 years ago, on the surface of the Moon.

00:05:58.667 --> 00:06:01.143
Now if you're going to go
to the Moon for three days

00:06:01.167 --> 00:06:03.101
and you're the first person to set foot,

00:06:03.125 --> 00:06:04.684
yeah, you can live in a tin can,

00:06:04.708 --> 00:06:08.934
but you wouldn't want to do that
for, say, a year and a half.

00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:12.393
So I did actually a calculation,
being in California.

00:06:12.417 --> 00:06:16.893
I looked at what the average size
of a cell at Alcatraz is,

00:06:16.917 --> 00:06:18.226
and I have news for you,

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.351
the volume in the Eagle there,
in the Lunar Module,

00:06:22.375 --> 00:06:26.059
was about the size of a cell at Alcatraz

00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:28.184
if it were only five feet high.

00:06:28.208 --> 00:06:31.309
So incredibly cramped living quarters.

00:06:31.333 --> 00:06:35.226
You just can't ask a human
to stay in there for long periods of time.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.333
So why not take these biomaterials
and make something?

00:06:39.167 --> 00:06:41.559
So here's an image
that a colleague of mine

00:06:41.583 --> 00:06:45.726
who is an architect, Chris Maurer,
has done of what we've been proposing,

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.018
and we'll get to the point

00:06:47.042 --> 00:06:49.476
of why I've been standing up here
holding something

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.601
that looks like a dried sandwich
this whole lecture.

00:06:52.625 --> 00:06:58.101
So we've proposed that the solution
to the habitat problem on Mars

00:06:58.125 --> 00:07:01.726
could just simply lie in a fungus.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.434
So I'm now probably
going to turn off everyone

00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:06.351
from ever eating a mushroom again.

00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:09.018
So let's talk about fungi for a second.

00:07:09.042 --> 00:07:12.351
So you're probably familiar
with this fruiting body of the fungus.

00:07:12.375 --> 00:07:13.684
That's the mushroom.

00:07:13.708 --> 00:07:17.226
But what we're interested in actually
is what's beneath the surface there,

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.559
the mycelium,

00:07:18.583 --> 00:07:21.018
which are these root hair-like structures

00:07:21.042 --> 00:07:25.268
that are really the main part
of the mushroom.

00:07:25.292 --> 00:07:27.726
Well, it turns out you can take those --

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.476
there's a micrograph I did --

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.393
and you can put them in a mold

00:07:32.417 --> 00:07:33.893
and give them a little food --

00:07:33.917 --> 00:07:36.976
and it doesn't take much,
you can grow these things on sawdust --

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.476
so this piece here was grown on sawdust,

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.934
and that mycelium then
will fill that structure

00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:44.434
to make something.

00:07:44.458 --> 00:07:48.059
We've actually tried
growing mycelium on Mars Simulant.

00:07:48.083 --> 00:07:50.393
So no one's actually
gone to the surface of Mars,

00:07:50.417 --> 00:07:52.351
but this is a simulated surface of Mars,

00:07:52.375 --> 00:07:54.726
and you can see those
hair-like mycelia out there.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.518
It's really amazing stuff.

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:58.601
How strong can you make these things?

00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:01.518
Well, you know, I could give you
numbers and tests and so on,

00:08:01.542 --> 00:08:04.184
but I think that's probably
the best way to describe it.

00:08:04.208 --> 00:08:07.226
There's one of my students
proving that you can do this.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.476
To do this, then, you've got to figure out
how to put it in context.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.268
How's this actually going to happen?

00:08:12.292 --> 00:08:14.018
I mean, this is a great idea, Lynn,

00:08:14.042 --> 00:08:16.309
but how are you going to get
from here to there?

00:08:16.333 --> 00:08:19.768
So what we're saying is you grow up
the mycelium in the lab, for example

00:08:19.792 --> 00:08:24.643
and then you fill up a little structure,
maybe a house-like structure that's tiny,

00:08:24.667 --> 00:08:28.934
that is maybe a double-bagged sort of
plastic thing, like an inflatable --

00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.393
I sort of think L.L.Bean when I see this.

00:08:31.417 --> 00:08:36.042
And then you put it in a rocket ship
and you send it off to Mars.

00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:38.375
Rocket lands,

00:08:40.917 --> 00:08:42.768
you release the bag

00:08:42.792 --> 00:08:44.558
and you add a little water,

00:08:44.582 --> 00:08:47.268
and voila, you've got your habitat.

00:08:47.292 --> 00:08:49.018
You know, how cool would that be?

00:08:49.042 --> 00:08:52.851
And the beauty of that is you don't
have to take something prebuilt.

00:08:52.875 --> 00:08:56.893
And so our estimates are that we could
save 90 percent of the mass

00:08:56.917 --> 00:09:01.268
that NASA is currently proposing
by taking up a big steel structure

00:09:01.292 --> 00:09:03.684
if we actually grow it on site.

00:09:03.708 --> 00:09:06.101
So let me give you another big idea.

00:09:06.125 --> 00:09:07.809
What about digital information?

00:09:07.833 --> 00:09:11.309
What's really interesting is
you have a physical link to your parents

00:09:11.333 --> 00:09:14.101
and they have a physical link
to their parents, and so on,

00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:16.268
all the way back to the origin of life.

00:09:16.292 --> 00:09:18.726
You have never broken that continuum.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:21.351
But the fact is that we can do that today.

00:09:21.375 --> 00:09:24.351
So we have students
every day in our labs --

00:09:24.375 --> 00:09:26.934
students in Boston even do this --

00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:29.934
that make up DNA sequences

00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:31.726
and they hit the "send" button

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.601
and they send them
to their local DNA synthesis company.

00:09:35.625 --> 00:09:38.934
Now once you break that physical link

00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:40.726
where you're sending it across town,

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.726
it doesn't matter if you're sending it
across the Charles River

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.934
or if you're sending
that information to Mars.

00:09:45.958 --> 00:09:47.559
You've broken that physical link.

00:09:47.583 --> 00:09:49.476
So then, once you're on Mars,

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.518
or across the river or wherever,

00:09:51.542 --> 00:09:53.768
you can take that digital information,

00:09:53.792 --> 00:09:56.268
synthesize the physical DNA,

00:09:56.292 --> 00:09:57.893
put it maybe in another organism

00:09:57.917 --> 00:10:00.559
and voila, you've got
new capabilities there.

00:10:00.583 --> 00:10:04.434
So again, you've broken
that physical link. That's huge.

00:10:04.458 --> 00:10:05.809
What about chemistry?

00:10:05.833 --> 00:10:08.184
Biology does chemistry for us on Earth,

00:10:08.208 --> 00:10:10.976
and again has for literally
thousands of years.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.434
I bet virtually everyone in this room
has eaten something today

00:10:14.458 --> 00:10:17.143
that has been made
by biology doing chemistry.

00:10:17.167 --> 00:10:19.226
Let me give you a big hint there.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.851
What about another idea?

00:10:20.875 --> 00:10:24.184
What about using DNA itself
to make a wire?

00:10:24.208 --> 00:10:26.732
Because again, we're trying
to miniaturize everything.

00:10:26.756 --> 00:10:28.643
DNA is really cheap.

00:10:28.667 --> 00:10:31.434
Strawberries have
a gazillion amount of DNA.

00:10:31.458 --> 00:10:35.018
You know, you could take
a strawberry with you, isolate the DNA,

00:10:35.042 --> 00:10:38.226
and one of my students
has figured out a way

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.476
to take DNA and tweak it a little bit

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.851
so that you can incorporate
silver atoms in very specific places,

00:10:44.875 --> 00:10:46.851
thus making an electrical wire.

00:10:46.875 --> 00:10:48.559
How cool is that?

00:10:48.583 --> 00:10:51.351
So while we're on the subject of metals,

00:10:51.375 --> 00:10:56.059
we're going to need to use metals
for things like integrated circuits.

00:10:56.083 --> 00:10:59.601
Probably we're going to want it
for some structures, and so on.

00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:03.184
And things like integrated circuits
ultimately go bad.

00:11:03.208 --> 00:11:06.351
We could talk a lot about that,
but I'm going to leave it at that,

00:11:06.375 --> 00:11:08.143
that they do go bad,

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:10.768
and so where are you going
to get those metals?

00:11:10.792 --> 00:11:13.351
Yeah, you could try to mine them
with heavy equipment,

00:11:13.375 --> 00:11:15.393
but you get that upmass problem.

00:11:15.417 --> 00:11:19.268
And I always tell people, the best way
to find the metals for a new cell phone

00:11:19.292 --> 00:11:21.018
is in a dead cell phone.

00:11:21.042 --> 00:11:24.559
So what if you take biology

00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:27.018
as the technology to get these metals out?

00:11:27.042 --> 00:11:28.393
And how do you do this?

00:11:28.417 --> 00:11:31.143
Well, take a look
at the back of a vitamin bottle

00:11:31.167 --> 00:11:34.518
and you'll get an idea
of all the sorts of metals

00:11:34.542 --> 00:11:36.893
that we actually use in our bodies.

00:11:36.917 --> 00:11:40.309
So we have a lot of proteins
as well as other organisms

00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:43.268
that can actually
specifically bind metals.

00:11:43.292 --> 00:11:46.059
So what if we now take those proteins

00:11:46.083 --> 00:11:49.309
and maybe attach them
to this fungal mycelium

00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:52.518
and make a filter so we can start
to pull those metals out

00:11:52.542 --> 00:11:56.601
in a very specific way
without big mining equipment,

00:11:56.625 --> 00:11:59.601
and, even better, we've actually
got a proof of concept

00:11:59.625 --> 00:12:03.559
where we've then taken those metals
that we pulled out with proteins

00:12:03.583 --> 00:12:07.601
and reprinted an integrated circuit
using a plasma printer.

00:12:07.625 --> 00:12:09.000
Again, how cool?

00:12:10.208 --> 00:12:14.643
Electricity: I was asked
by a head of one of the NASA centers

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:19.393
if you could ever take chemical energy
and turn that into electrical energy.

00:12:19.417 --> 00:12:22.643
Well, the great news is it's not
just the electric eel that does it.

00:12:22.667 --> 00:12:25.976
Everybody in this room
who is still alive and functioning

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.726
is doing that.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.684
Part of the food that you've eaten today

00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:32.643
has gone to operate
the nerve cells in your body.

00:12:32.667 --> 00:12:36.101
But even other organisms,
nonsentient ones,

00:12:36.125 --> 00:12:37.851
are creating electric energy,

00:12:37.875 --> 00:12:39.476
even bacteria.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:42.059
Some bacteria are very good
at making little wires.

00:12:42.083 --> 00:12:43.976
So if we can harvest that ability

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.768
of turning chemical energy
into electrical energy,

00:12:46.792 --> 00:12:48.893
again, how cool would that be?

00:12:48.917 --> 00:12:51.268
So here are some
of the big ideas we talked about.

00:12:51.292 --> 00:12:54.018
Let me try one more: life 2.0.

00:12:54.042 --> 00:12:59.018
So for example, all of the sugars
in our body are right-handed.

00:12:59.042 --> 00:13:01.976
Why shouldn't we make an organism
with left-handed sugars?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.601
Why not make an organism that can do
things that no organism can do today?

00:13:07.625 --> 00:13:12.059
So organisms normally have evolved
to live in very specific environments.

00:13:12.083 --> 00:13:15.309
So here's this lion cub
literally up a tree,

00:13:15.333 --> 00:13:17.351
and I took a picture of him a bit later,

00:13:17.375 --> 00:13:19.995
and he was a lot happier
when he was down on the ground.

00:13:20.019 --> 00:13:23.059
So organisms are designed
for specific environments.

00:13:23.083 --> 00:13:26.226
But what if you can go back
to that idea of synthetic biology

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:27.559
and tweak 'em around?

00:13:27.583 --> 00:13:30.768
So here is one of our favorite places
in Yellowstone National Park.

00:13:30.792 --> 00:13:32.101
This is Octopus Springs.

00:13:32.125 --> 00:13:33.851
If you tilt your head a little bit,

00:13:33.875 --> 00:13:37.143
it sort of looks like a body
and tentacles coming out.

00:13:37.167 --> 00:13:39.268
It's above the boiling
temperature of water.

00:13:39.292 --> 00:13:42.518
Those organisms that you see
on the edge and the colors

00:13:42.542 --> 00:13:45.143
actually match the temperatures
that are there,

00:13:45.167 --> 00:13:47.625
very, very high-temperature thermophiles.

00:13:48.833 --> 00:13:51.893
So why not take organisms
that can live at extremes,

00:13:51.917 --> 00:13:54.184
whether it's high temperature
or low temperature

00:13:54.208 --> 00:13:55.518
or low pH or high pH

00:13:55.542 --> 00:13:58.559
or high salt or high levels of radiation,

00:13:58.583 --> 00:14:00.768
and take some of those capabilities

00:14:00.792 --> 00:14:02.768
and put it into other organisms.

00:14:02.792 --> 00:14:05.226
And this is a project
that my students have called,

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.143
and I love this, the "hell cell."

00:14:07.167 --> 00:14:08.476
And so we've done that.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.226
We've taken organisms and sort of
tweaked them and pushed them to the edges.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.559
And this is important
for getting us off planet

00:14:14.583 --> 00:14:18.143
and also for understanding
what life is like in the universe.

00:14:18.167 --> 00:14:20.708
So let me give you
just a couple of final thoughts.

00:14:22.542 --> 00:14:25.518
First is this whole idea
that we have all these needs

00:14:25.542 --> 00:14:27.768
for human settlement off planet

00:14:27.792 --> 00:14:30.976
that are in some ways
exactly like we have on the Earth,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.851
that we need the food
and we need the shelter and so on,

00:14:33.875 --> 00:14:36.101
but we have very, very
different constraints

00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:40.393
of this upmass problem and the reliability
and the flexibility and so on.

00:14:40.417 --> 00:14:43.393
But because we have these constraints
that you don't have here,

00:14:43.417 --> 00:14:46.934
where you might have to think about
the indigenous petrochemical industry,

00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.684
or whatever,

00:14:48.708 --> 00:14:52.500
you now have constraints
that have to unleash creativity.

00:14:55.292 --> 00:14:59.309
And once you unleash this creativity
because you have the new constraints,

00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:02.934
you're forcing game-changing
technological advances

00:15:02.958 --> 00:15:05.208
that you wouldn't have gotten
any other way.

00:15:06.917 --> 00:15:09.976
Finally, we have to think a little bit,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.292
is it a good idea
to tinker around with life?

00:15:15.083 --> 00:15:18.643
Well, the sort of easy answer to that is

00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:22.393
that probably no one in the room
keeps a wolf cub at home,

00:15:22.417 --> 00:15:25.101
but you might have a puppy or a dog;

00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:29.309
you probably didn't eat teosinte
this summer, but you ate corn.

00:15:29.333 --> 00:15:33.184
We have been doing
genetic modification with organisms

00:15:33.208 --> 00:15:35.559
for literally 10,000 or more years.

00:15:35.583 --> 00:15:38.601
This is a different approach,
but to say all of a sudden

00:15:38.625 --> 00:15:41.018
humans should never touch an organism

00:15:41.042 --> 00:15:42.351
is kinda silly

00:15:42.375 --> 00:15:44.684
because we have that capability now

00:15:44.708 --> 00:15:49.476
to do things that are far more
beneficial for the planet Earth

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.583
and for life beyond that.

00:15:52.917 --> 00:15:54.809
And so then the question is, should we?

00:15:54.833 --> 00:15:57.934
And of course I feel
that not only should we,

00:15:57.958 --> 00:15:59.643
at least for getting off Earth,

00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:02.684
but actually if we don't
use synthetic biology,

00:16:02.708 --> 00:16:05.184
we will never solve this upmass problem.

00:16:05.208 --> 00:16:09.934
So once you think of life as a technology,
you've got the solution.

00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:13.476
And so, with that, I'd like to finish
the way I always finish,

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.768
and say "ad astra,"
which means, "to the stars."

00:16:15.792 --> 00:16:17.226
Thank you very much, Boston.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.667
(Applause)
