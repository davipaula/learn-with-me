00:00:12.583 --> 00:00:13.851
A few years ago,

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:17.125
I had a corporate feminist dream job.

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:20.059
Launching a company's national initiative

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:22.518
to recruit more female employees.

00:00:22.542 --> 00:00:24.292
In the finance sector.

00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:27.851
But first, I had to get
the signed-off support

00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:29.601
of all department heads.

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:32.434
So I spent months perfecting the proposal,

00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:33.768
presented it

00:00:33.792 --> 00:00:37.000
and won the support of almost everyone.

00:00:38.542 --> 00:00:42.875
But in this team, there were two men
we'll call Howard and Tom.

00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:46.893
Howard just would not get back to me.

00:00:46.917 --> 00:00:48.768
I emailed him about the proposal,

00:00:48.792 --> 00:00:50.643
I left him voice mails,

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:53.184
I'd roll my chair back and forth
during meetings,

00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:55.066
trying to make eye contact with Howard.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.101
(Laughter)

00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:59.458
He'd just take out his phone
and start scrolling.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.976
And then I started to question myself.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.601
Had I been diplomatic enough
in that email?

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:09.684
Too demanding in that voice mail?

00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:12.351
Does Howard hate this proposal

00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:14.934
or am I just overreacting?

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:18.143
It's probably just me, I thought.

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:19.559
And then one day,

00:01:19.583 --> 00:01:23.518
I'm walking down the hall
and here comes Howard.

00:01:23.542 --> 00:01:25.351
He's holding a packet of papers,

00:01:25.375 --> 00:01:27.684
sees me and lights up.

00:01:27.708 --> 00:01:28.976
He says,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.018
"Sara, Tom just emailed this to me,
you should take a look.

00:01:32.042 --> 00:01:35.143
It's a proposal for us
to recruit more women."

00:01:35.167 --> 00:01:36.434
(Laughter)

00:01:36.458 --> 00:01:38.601
"I think Tom has a really great idea here,

00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:40.542
and we should all get behind it."

00:01:42.042 --> 00:01:46.184
Howard proceeds to hand
my own proposal back to me.

00:01:46.208 --> 00:01:49.351
And explains to me
the many merits of what I wrote.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:51.792
(Laughter)

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:56.976
Howard was never against
recruiting more women.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.643
But he needed to hear from a man

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:02.708
why it was important to hire more women.

00:02:03.708 --> 00:02:06.268
And as this scene played out,

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.208
I said nothing.

00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:14.976
Because I knew somehow that I was a guest

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.375
in a place that wasn't meant for me.

00:02:18.292 --> 00:02:21.226
And so instead of questioning
my environment,

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.167
I questioned myself.

00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:26.101
I wanted to know

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:29.476
how so many talented women
who worked long hours

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.893
and started their careers with confidence

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:36.268
all became trained in this kind
of self-doubt that makes them say,

00:02:36.292 --> 00:02:38.125
"It's probably just me."

00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:41.018
How was that still possible?

00:02:41.042 --> 00:02:43.476
Aren't things getting better?

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.226
Opportunities for women
have increased over the last 50 years.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.309
But over the last decade,
progress has stalled.

00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:56.018
Experts have previously identified 2059

00:02:56.042 --> 00:02:58.768
as the year the wage gap would close.

00:02:58.792 --> 00:03:00.643
But in September of this year,

00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:04.268
these same experts announced
that according to the most current data,

00:03:04.292 --> 00:03:07.684
we'll have to adjust our expectations

00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:10.309
to the year 2119.

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:11.601
(Audience murmurs)

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:15.101
One hundred one years from now.

00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:17.268
Looking beyond the wage gap,

00:03:17.292 --> 00:03:20.309
women are still
underrepresented in leadership,

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:23.184
receive less access to senior leaders

00:03:23.208 --> 00:03:25.518
and are leaving
the fastest-growing sectors,

00:03:25.542 --> 00:03:26.851
such as tech,

00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:30.934
at 45 percent higher rates than men,

00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:35.042
citing culture as the primary reason.

00:03:35.875 --> 00:03:39.018
So what have we been doing
to address gender inequality?

00:03:39.042 --> 00:03:41.143
Why isn't it working?

00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:43.809
Many businesses think
they're addressing the problem,

00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:46.143
because they provide training.

00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:50.851
Eight billion dollars
worth of training a year,

00:03:50.875 --> 00:03:54.143
according to studies
from the "Harvard Business Review."

00:03:54.167 --> 00:03:58.309
These same studies also conclude
that these trainings don't work

00:03:58.333 --> 00:04:01.268
and often backfire.

00:04:01.292 --> 00:04:06.059
Research tracking the hiring
and promotion practices of 830 companies

00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:08.059
over the course of 30 years

00:04:08.083 --> 00:04:12.684
found that white men who are asked
to go to diversity trainings

00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:14.518
tend to rebel

00:04:14.542 --> 00:04:17.809
by hiring and promoting fewer women

00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:20.434
and fewer minorities.

00:04:20.458 --> 00:04:25.893
The other solution has been to ask women
to change their own behavior.

00:04:25.917 --> 00:04:27.809
To lean in.

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:29.768
To sit at the table.

00:04:29.792 --> 00:04:31.518
Negotiate as often as men.

00:04:31.542 --> 00:04:33.250
Oh, and get more training.

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:38.726
Women currently earn
the majority of college degrees,

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.768
outperform their peers
in key leadership skills

00:04:41.792 --> 00:04:45.143
and are running businesses
that outperform the competition.

00:04:45.167 --> 00:04:46.934
It doesn't look like education

00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:50.518
or skills or business acumen
are the problem.

00:04:50.542 --> 00:04:52.559
We're already empowered.

00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:56.309
Enough to make an impact
on the businesses that are ready.

00:04:56.333 --> 00:05:00.309
These approaches fail to address
the key systemic problem:

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.542
Unconscious bias.

00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:10.458
(Applause)

00:05:11.792 --> 00:05:15.018
We all have bias, it's OK.

00:05:15.042 --> 00:05:17.059
It's lodged in our amygdala,

00:05:17.083 --> 00:05:19.851
it keeps ticking away when we go to work.

00:05:19.875 --> 00:05:23.059
Bias affects how much I like you,

00:05:23.083 --> 00:05:25.684
what I believe you're capable of

00:05:25.708 --> 00:05:28.726
and even how much space
I think you take up.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.393
Thanks in part to the Me Too movement,

00:05:31.417 --> 00:05:33.792
awareness of gender bias has spread.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.851
But the harassment stories
that made headlines

00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:40.309
are just one piece.

00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:43.934
You don't have to harass a woman
to limit her career.

00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.851
The messages women send me
aren't about being harassed.

00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:52.393
They're being tolerated in the workplace.

00:05:52.417 --> 00:05:54.708
But they're not being valued.

00:05:56.417 --> 00:05:59.393
I don't know anyone who has ever said,

00:05:59.417 --> 00:06:02.184
"You know what I love about my employer?

00:06:02.208 --> 00:06:04.226
They just tolerate me so well,

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.934
I feel so tolerated."

00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:09.809
(Laughter)

00:06:09.833 --> 00:06:11.601
To break the inertia,

00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:14.726
we need to take a step beyond Me Too.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.101
Beyond just being tolerated as women.

00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:22.309
Our organization decided
to tackle the problem in two ways.

00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:24.434
First, if we're all biased,

00:06:24.458 --> 00:06:29.309
our workplaces need to be
actively antibiased by design,

00:06:29.333 --> 00:06:33.226
not by trying to change mindsets
one training at a time.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.934
So our team began by identifying
over 100 cultural levers

00:06:37.958 --> 00:06:42.101
that can be adjusted
to counter the impact of bias.

00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:45.934
We found that small tweaks
can lead to big changes.

00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:49.226
And they cost a lot less
than eight billion dollars.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.976
So what do these small tweaks look like?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.143
If a woman is asked to state her gender

00:06:54.167 --> 00:06:56.809
before filling out a job application,

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:59.226
or performing a skills-related test,

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.893
she performs worse
than if she were not asked first.

00:07:03.917 --> 00:07:09.059
So how can businesses avoid activating
this self-stereotyping bias?

00:07:09.083 --> 00:07:12.542
Move the gender check box
to the end of the application.

00:07:13.375 --> 00:07:14.625
Example two.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.643
In a national survey that we conducted,

00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:22.601
men were 50 percent more likely to state

00:07:22.625 --> 00:07:26.726
they had received multiple,
frequent evaluations

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.934
over the course of the last year.

00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:32.393
As opposed to one single yearly review.

00:07:32.417 --> 00:07:34.559
Here's why this matters.

00:07:34.583 --> 00:07:38.851
"Fortune" magazine reviewed
performance evals across industries.

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:43.184
And found that criticism like this
related to personality,

00:07:43.208 --> 00:07:44.476
["Watch your tone!"]

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.101
but not job-related skills,

00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:51.667
appeared in 71 of the 94
yearly reviews received by women.

00:07:52.417 --> 00:07:55.226
Of the 83 reviews received by men,

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.417
personality criticism showed up twice.

00:07:59.708 --> 00:08:05.184
But in businesses that conduct
much shorter, highly frequent reviews,

00:08:05.208 --> 00:08:07.643
say, five-minute weekly evaluations

00:08:07.667 --> 00:08:09.893
focused on specific projects,

00:08:09.917 --> 00:08:13.601
the personality criticism vanishes.

00:08:13.625 --> 00:08:16.268
And the perceived performance gap
between men and women

00:08:16.292 --> 00:08:18.643
is nearly nonexistent.

00:08:18.667 --> 00:08:21.643
While yearly reviews rely
on overall impressions,

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:24.667
which are like petri dishes for bias,

00:08:25.583 --> 00:08:28.476
short, objectively focused evaluations

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.476
eliminate this feelings-based gray area.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.934
Now, some businesses
are consciously taking these steps

00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.518
to counter the impact of bias,

00:08:38.542 --> 00:08:42.851
while others just do
a good job of advertising.

00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:46.893
We wanted to find out
who is actually getting it right.

00:08:46.917 --> 00:08:49.726
So we put a poll on Facebook,

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.768
we asked women in workshops

00:08:51.792 --> 00:08:55.893
how they were choosing employers
where they would be valued.

00:08:55.917 --> 00:08:58.476
The most common response that we heard?

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.226
"I Google it."

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.268
So we googled it.

00:09:02.292 --> 00:09:03.643
(Laughter)

00:09:03.667 --> 00:09:08.268
Specifically, we googled
"best employers for women in tech."

00:09:08.292 --> 00:09:13.018
Our results showed
three completely different lists.

00:09:13.042 --> 00:09:15.893
One business shows up
as the top employer on one list,

00:09:15.917 --> 00:09:18.059
doesn't show up at all on another,

00:09:18.083 --> 00:09:20.518
some lists offer no criteria

00:09:20.542 --> 00:09:22.768
and some are purchased ads.

00:09:22.792 --> 00:09:24.042
They're paid for.

00:09:25.667 --> 00:09:29.559
Employees and employers
both want clear benchmarks

00:09:29.583 --> 00:09:32.458
that go beyond good intentions.

00:09:33.542 --> 00:09:37.018
The LEED certification
gave businesses this clarity

00:09:37.042 --> 00:09:38.851
around environmental stewardship

00:09:38.875 --> 00:09:43.643
by outlining the exact steps
they need to take for certification.

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:48.143
We wanted businesses to have
this kind of playbook for gender equity.

00:09:48.167 --> 00:09:50.351
So for our second act,

00:09:50.375 --> 00:09:54.059
we took what we had learned
from testing these cultural levers,

00:09:54.083 --> 00:09:56.851
we partnered with
the University of Washington

00:09:56.875 --> 00:10:00.309
and created the first
standardized certification

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:03.809
for gender equity in US businesses.

00:10:03.833 --> 00:10:09.351
(Applause)

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:10.643
Thank you.

00:10:10.667 --> 00:10:13.476
(Applause)

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.351
To create this standard,

00:10:15.375 --> 00:10:18.976
we had to learn what matters
and what doesn't.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.476
We found out that what matters

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.309
is not the total percentage
of female employees.

00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:26.601
Or the number of board members
that are female.

00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:29.309
Those are what we call vanity metrics.

00:10:29.333 --> 00:10:30.976
They can be bought,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.601
while the culture inside
can still be out of balance.

00:10:35.625 --> 00:10:38.726
The factors that matter
and that should be measured

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.059
are under the surface.

00:10:41.083 --> 00:10:42.476
For example,

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.893
even in organizations where
equal percentages of women and men

00:10:45.917 --> 00:10:48.809
state that they have had
access to a mentor,

00:10:48.833 --> 00:10:53.393
men's mentors are more likely
to be in senior positions.

00:10:53.417 --> 00:10:55.601
Reviewing our survey results,

00:10:55.625 --> 00:10:58.393
men were twice as likely to state

00:10:58.417 --> 00:11:02.333
they had been offered an opportunity
to shadow someone in a senior role.

00:11:03.708 --> 00:11:06.643
We're all used to hearing
about the wage gap.

00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:11.851
Hidden opportunity gaps like these
are just as influential.

00:11:11.875 --> 00:11:14.226
So when assessing a company's culture,

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:18.351
we measure these gaps
between men's and women's experiences.

00:11:18.375 --> 00:11:20.018
And the smaller the gap,

00:11:20.042 --> 00:11:22.893
the more equity is center of the culture.

00:11:22.917 --> 00:11:24.934
We also searched our findings

00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.726
for the tenets of workplace culture

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:30.684
that are most important to men
and most important to women.

00:11:30.708 --> 00:11:34.559
We learned that only three factors
consistently matter to men,

00:11:34.583 --> 00:11:37.101
while a dozen matter to women.

00:11:37.125 --> 00:11:39.893
And they only share one in common.

00:11:39.917 --> 00:11:42.143
Topping the list for women:

00:11:42.167 --> 00:11:44.018
Paid family leave,

00:11:44.042 --> 00:11:46.143
health care for dependents

00:11:46.167 --> 00:11:48.559
and feeling that their ideas are heard

00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:51.768
and they're properly credited for them.

00:11:51.792 --> 00:11:55.809
These are a few of the 188 indicators

00:11:55.833 --> 00:11:58.559
that determine whether or not
an organization

00:11:58.583 --> 00:12:02.809
meets our quantitative standard
for workplace equality.

00:12:02.833 --> 00:12:05.726
Based on the data that matter.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:07.393
These are the factors

00:12:07.417 --> 00:12:11.143
to create a culture of equity that lasts.

00:12:11.167 --> 00:12:13.893
Not just for a month or for a quarter

00:12:13.917 --> 00:12:15.292
but for years.

00:12:17.208 --> 00:12:19.458
So where does this leave us?

00:12:21.583 --> 00:12:25.976
Women in the workforce today
are constantly told,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.643
"You can be anything you want now.

00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:30.125
It's up to you."

00:12:31.708 --> 00:12:33.393
Women of color,

00:12:33.417 --> 00:12:36.143
for whom the wage gap is even larger,

00:12:36.167 --> 00:12:37.417
have heard it.

00:12:38.417 --> 00:12:43.583
The two-thirds of minimum-wage workers
who are women have heard it.

00:12:44.583 --> 00:12:47.643
Workers who don't identify
as male or female

00:12:47.667 --> 00:12:49.309
and hide their identity at work

00:12:49.333 --> 00:12:50.601
have heard it.

00:12:50.625 --> 00:12:53.518
If they can hear,
"You can be anything you want now,

00:12:53.542 --> 00:12:55.059
it's up to you,"

00:12:55.083 --> 00:12:58.083
I believe it's time
for our businesses to hear it, too.

00:12:59.417 --> 00:13:03.768
Eliminating workplace bias
is a tall order.

00:13:03.792 --> 00:13:07.684
But we can't afford
to let half our people go on

00:13:07.708 --> 00:13:09.125
being ignored.

00:13:10.333 --> 00:13:13.893
We've given businesses
a framework for real change.

00:13:13.917 --> 00:13:17.309
Businesses can be anything they want now.

00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:19.351
It is up to them.

00:13:19.375 --> 00:13:20.643
Thank you.

00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:25.042
(Applause)
