00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.400
I got invited to an exclusive resort

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.896
to deliver a talk about the digital future

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.496
to what I assumed would be
a couple of hundred tech executives.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.216
And I was there in the green room,
waiting to go on,

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.416
and instead of bringing me to the stage,
they brought five men into the green room

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.496
who sat around this little table with me.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.616
They were tech billionaires.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.176
And they started peppering me
with these really binary questions,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.200
like: Bitcoin or Etherium?

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.776
Virtual reality or augmented reality?

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.296
I don't know if they were
taking bets or what.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.136
And as they got more comfortable with me,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.376
they edged towards
their real question of concern.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.640
Alaska or New Zealand?

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.976
That's right.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.976
These tech billionaires
were asking a media theorist for advice

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.880
on where to put their doomsday bunkers.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.736
We spent the rest of the hour
on the single question:

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.376
"How do I maintain control
of my security staff

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.720
after the event?"

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.656
By "the event" they mean
the thermonuclear war

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.336
or climate catastrophe or social unrest
that ends the world as we know it,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.640
and more importantly,
makes their money obsolete.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.416
And I couldn't help but think:

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.176
these are the wealthiest,
most powerful men in the world,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.856
yet they see themselves as utterly
powerless to influence the future.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.336
The best they can do is hang on
for the inevitable catastrophe

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.040
and then use their technology and money
to get away from the rest of us.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.056
And these are the winners
of the digital economy.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.496
(Laughter)

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.296
The digital renaissance

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.576
was about the unbridled potential

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.016
of the collective human imagination.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.176
It spanned everything
from chaos math and quantum physics

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.376
to fantasy role-playing
and the Gaia hypothesis, right?

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.120
We believed that human beings connected
could create any future we could imagine.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.039
And then came the dot com boom.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.216
And the digital future
became stock futures.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.256
And we used all that energy
of the digital age

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.536
to pump steroids into the already dying
NASDAQ stock exchange.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.176
The tech magazines told us
a tsunami was coming.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.656
And only the investors who hired
the best scenario-planners and futurists

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.200
would be able to survive the wave.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.056
And so the future changed from this thing
we create together in the present

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.576
to something we bet on

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.800
in some kind of a zero-sum
winner-takes-all competition.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.256
And when things get that competitive
about the future,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.576
humans are no longer valued
for our creativity.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.736
No, now we're just valued for our data.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.136
Because they can use the data
to make predictions.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.736
Creativity, if anything,
that creates noise.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.976
That makes it harder to predict.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.416
So we ended up with a digital landscape

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.696
that really repressed creativity,
repressed novelty,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.560
it repressed what makes us most human.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.216
We ended up with social media.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.696
Does social media really connect people
in new, interesting ways?

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.736
No, social media is about using our data
to predict our future behavior.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.656
Or when necessary,
to influence our future behavior

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.720
so that we act more in accordance
with our statistical profiles.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.416
The digital economy --
does it like people?

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.336
No, if you have a business plan,
what are you supposed to do?

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.616
Get rid of all the people.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.040
Human beings, they want health care,
they want money, they want meaning.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.240
You can't scale with people.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.816
(Laughter)

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.056
Even our digital apps --

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.296
they don't help us
form any rapport or solidarity.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.736
I mean, where's the button
on the ride hailing app

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.256
for the drivers to talk to one another
about their working conditions

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.480
or to unionize?

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.616
Even our videoconferencing tools,

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.016
they don't allow us
to establish real rapport.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.376
However good the resolution of the video,

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.416
you still can't see if somebody's irises
are opening to really take you in.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.016
All of the things that we've done
to establish rapport

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.375
that we've developed over hundreds
of thousands of years of evolution,

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:32.616
they don't work,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.656
you can't see if someone's breath
is syncing up with yours.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.336
So the mirror neurons never fire,
the oxytocin never goes through your body,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.600
you never have that experience
of bonding with the other human being.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.816
And instead, you're left like,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.096
"Well, they agreed with me,
but did they really,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.816
did they really get me?"

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.216
And we don't blame the technology
for that lack of fidelity.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.720
We blame the other person.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.376
You know, even the technologies
and the digital initiatives that we have

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.576
to promote humans,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.360
are intensely anti-human at the core.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.600
Think about the blockchain.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.136
The blockchain is here to help us
have a great humanized economy? No.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.856
The blockchain does not engender
trust between users,

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.416
the blockchain simply
substitutes for trust in a new,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.440
even less transparent way.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.416
Or the code movement.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.616
I mean, education is great,
we love education,

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.096
and it's a wonderful idea

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.256
that we want kids to be able
to get jobs in the digital future,

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.880
so we'll teach them code now.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.120
But since when is education
about getting jobs?

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.656
Education wasn't about getting jobs.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.656
Education was compensation
for a job well done.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.256
The idea of public education

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.656
was for coal miners,
who would work in the coal mines all day,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.256
then they'd come home
and they should have the dignity

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.416
to be able to read a novel
and understand it.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.400
Or the intelligence to be able
to participate in democracy.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.416
When we make it an extension of the job,
what are we really doing?

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.976
We're just letting corporations really

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.120
externalize the cost
of training their workers.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.616
And the worst of all really
is the humane technology movement.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.456
I mean, I love these guys,
the former guys who used to take

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.416
the algorithms from
Las Vegas slot machines

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.376
and put them in our social media feed
so that we get addicted.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.336
Now they've seen the error of their ways

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.816
and they want to make
technology more humane.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.256
But when I hear the expression
"humane technology,"

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.136
I think about cage-free
chickens or something.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.416
We're going to be as humane
as possible to them,

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.160
until we take them to the slaughter.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:36.616
So now they're going to let these
technologies be as humane as possible,

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.856
as long as they extract enough data
and extract enough money from us

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.280
to please their shareholders.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.696
Meanwhile, the shareholders,
for their part, they're just thinking,

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.696
"I need to earn enough money now,
so I can insulate myself

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.776
from the world I'm creating
by earning money in this way."

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.176
(Laughter)

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.256
No matter how many VR goggles
they slap on their faces

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.536
and whatever fantasy world they go into,

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.096
they can't externalize the slavery
and pollution that was caused

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.096
through the manufacture
of the very device.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.296
It reminds me of
Thomas Jefferson's dumbwaiter.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.656
Now, we like to think
that he made the dumbwaiter

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.336
in order to spare his slaves
all that labor of carrying the food

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.136
up to the dining room
for the people to eat.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.656
That's not what it was for,
it wasn't for the slaves,

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.016
it was for Thomas Jefferson
and his dinner guests,

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:27.136
so they didn't have to see the slave
bringing the food up.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.736
The food just arrived magically,

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.760
like it was coming out
of a "Start Trek" replicator.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.816
It's part of an ethos that says,

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.120
human beings are the problem
and technology is the solution.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.736
We can't think that way anymore.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:48.056
We have to stop using technology
to optimize human beings for the market

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:53.120
and start optimizing technology
for the human future.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.736
But that's a really hard argument
to make these days,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.816
because humans are not popular beings.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.216
I talked about this in front
of an environmentalist just the other day,

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.336
and she said, "Why are you
defending humans?

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.056
Humans destroyed the planet.
They deserve to go extinct."

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.536
(Laughter)

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.136
Even our popular media hates humans.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.416
Watch television,

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.176
all the sci-fi shows are about how robots
are better and nicer than people.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.176
Even zombie shows --
what is every zombie show about?

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.456
Some person, looking at the horizon
at some zombie going by,

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.376
and they zoom in on the person
and you see the person's face,

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.136
and you know what they're thinking:

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.896
"What's really the difference
between that zombie and me?

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.456
He walks, I walk.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.496
He eats, I eat.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.800
He kills, I kill."

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.896
But he's a zombie.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.336
At least you're aware of it.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.056
If we are actually having trouble
distinguishing ourselves from zombies,

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.256
we have a pretty big problem going on.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.496
(Laughter)

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.456
And don't even get me started
on the transhumanists.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.296
I was on a panel with a transhumanist,
and he's going on about the singularity.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.176
"Oh, the day is going to come really soon
when computers are smarter than people.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.336
And the only option
for people at that point

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:08.696
is to pass the evolutionary torch
to our successor

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.336
and fade into the background.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.816
Maybe at best, upload
your consciousness to a silicon chip.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.680
And accept your extinction."

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.096
(Laughter)

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.496
And I said, "No, human beings are special.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.056
We can embrace ambiguity,
we understand paradox,

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.696
we're conscious,
we're weird, we're quirky.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.056
There should be a place for humans
in the digital future."

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.616
And he said, "Oh, Rushkoff,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.936
you're just saying that
because you're a human."

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.736
(Laughter)

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.360
As if it's hubris.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.080
OK, I'm on "Team Human."

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.056
That was the original insight
of the digital age.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.296
That being human is a team sport,

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.056
evolution's a collaborative act.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.496
Even the trees in the forest,

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.736
they're not all in competition
with each other,

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.976
they're connected with the vast
network of roots and mushrooms

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.536
that let them communicate with one another
and pass nutrients back and forth.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.696
If human beings
are the most evolved species,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.856
it's because we have the most evolved
ways of collaborating and communicating.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.376
We have language.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.640
We have technology.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.696
It's funny, I used to be the guy
who talked about the digital future

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.400
for people who hadn't yet
experienced anything digital.

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.016
And now I feel like I'm the last guy

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.960
who remembers what life was like
before digital technology.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.896
It's not a matter of rejecting the digital
or rejecting the technological.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.016
It's a matter of retrieving the values
that we're in danger of leaving behind

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.640
and then embedding them in the digital
infrastructure for the future.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.176
And that's not rocket science.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.296
It's as simple as making a social network

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.856
that instead of teaching us
to see people as adversaries,

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.880
it teaches us to see
our adversaries as people.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.536
It means creating an economy
that doesn't favor a platform monopoly

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.896
that wants to extract all the value
out of people and places,

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.856
but one that promotes the circulation
of value through a community

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.296
and allows us to establish
platform cooperatives

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.136
that distribute ownership
as wide as possible.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.816
It means building platforms

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:18.496
that don't repress our creativity
and novelty in the name of prediction

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.096
but actually promote
creativity and novelty,

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.456
so that we can come up
with some of the solutions

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.160
to actually get ourselves
out of the mess that we're in.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.496
No, instead of trying to earn
enough money to insulate ourselves

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.016
from the world we're creating,

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.096
why don't we spend that time and energy
making the world a place

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.160
that we don't feel
the need to escape from.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.200
There is no escape,
there is only one thing going on here.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.800
Please, don't leave.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.000
Join us.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.096
We may not be perfect,

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.560
but whatever happens,
at least you won't be alone.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.160
Join "Team Human."

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.256
Find the others.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.240
Together, let's make the future
that we always wanted.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.056
Oh, and those tech billionaires
who wanted to know

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.336
how to maintain control of their
security force after the apocalypse,

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.256
you know what I told them?

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.496
"Start treating those people
with love and respect right now.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.960
Maybe you won't have
an apocalypse to worry about."

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.056
Thank you.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.520
(Applause)
