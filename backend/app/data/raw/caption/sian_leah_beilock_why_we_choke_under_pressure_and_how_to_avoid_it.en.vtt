00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.136
One of the most humiliating things

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.616
that you can say about someone
is "they choked."

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.760
And boy, do I know that feeling.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.096
Growing up, I was an avid athlete.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.896
My main sport was soccer,
and I was a goalkeeper,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.840
which is both the best
and the worst position on the field.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.856
You see, when you're a goalie,
you get this special uniform,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.696
you get all the glory
for a great shot saved,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.200
but you also get the grief
when you land a shot in the goal.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.296
When you're a goalie,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.936
all eyes are on you,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.000
and with that comes the pressure.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.256
I distinctly remember
one game in high school.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.536
I was playing for
the California state team

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.080
which is part of the Olympic
Development Program.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.176
I was having a great game ...

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:10.280
until I realized that the national coach
was standing right behind me.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.360
That's when everything changed.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.176
In a matter of seconds,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.016
I went from playing at the top
to the bottom of my ability.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.376
Just knowing that I was being evaluated
changed my performance

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.000
and forever how I thought about
the mental aspect of how we perform.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.096
All of a sudden the ball
seemed to go in slow motion,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.360
and I was fixated on my every move.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.176
The next shot that came I bobbled,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.320
but thankfully it didn't land in the goal.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.696
The shot after that,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.496
I wasn't so lucky:

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.800
I tipped it right into the net.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.016
My team lost;

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.200
the national coach walked away.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.000
I choked under the pressure
of those evaluative eyes on me.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.576
Just about everyone
does it from time to time --

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.056
there are so many opportunities,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.096
whether it's taking a test,

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.656
giving a talk,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.576
pitching to a client

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.576
or that special form of torture
I like to call the job interview.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.096
(Laughter)

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.976
But the question is why.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.160
Why do we sometimes fail to perform
up to our potential under pressure?

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.256
It's especially bewildering
in the case of athletes

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.600
who spend so much time
physically honing their craft.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.640
But what about their minds?

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.136
Not as much.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.096
This is true off
the playing field as well.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.576
Whether we're taking a test
of giving a talk,

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.456
it's easy to feel like we're ready --

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.136
at the top of our game --

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.760
and then perform at our worst
when it matters most.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.376
It turns out that rarely do we practice

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.216
under the types of conditions
we're actually going to perform under,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.496
and as a result,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.616
when all eyes are on us,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.520
we sometimes flub our performance.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.536
Of course, the question is,
why is this the case?

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.576
And my experience on the playing field --

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.256
and in other important
facets of my life --

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.416
really pushed me into the field
of cognitive science.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.800
I wanted to know how we could reach
our limitless potential.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.576
I wanted to understand
how we could use our knowledge

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.536
of the mind and the brain

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.640
to come up with psychological tools
that would help us perform at our best.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.736
So why does it happen?

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.056
Why do we sometimes fail
to perform up to what we're capable of

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.440
when the pressure is on?

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.736
It may not be so surprising to hear
that in stressful situations, we worry.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.976
We worry about the situation,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.496
the consequences,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.936
what others will think of us.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.376
But what is surprising
is that we often get in our own way

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.936
precisely because our worries
prompt us to concentrate too much.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.176
That's right --

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.280
we pay too much attention
to what we're doing.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.576
When we're concerned
about performing our best,

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.296
we often try and control
aspects of what we're doing

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.696
that are best left on autopilot,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.856
outside conscious awareness,

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.496
and as a result,

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.720
we mess up.

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:33.536
Think about a situation
where you're shuffling down the stairs.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.216
What would happen if I asked you

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.456
to think about what
you're doing with your knee

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.736
while you're doing that?

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.920
There's a good chance
you'd fall on your face.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.416
We as humans only have the ability
to pay attention to so much at once,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.696
which is why, by the way,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.400
it's not a good idea
to drive and talk on the cell phone.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.536
And under pressure,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.056
when we're concerned
about performing at our best,

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.696
we can try and control
aspects of what we're doing

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.840
that should be left
outside conscious control.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.000
The end result is that we mess up.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.016
My research team and I have studied
this phenomenon of overattention,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.880
and we call it paralysis by analysis.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.056
In one study, we asked college
soccer players to dribble a soccer ball

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.496
and to pay attention
to an aspect of their performance

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.080
that they would not otherwise attend to.

00:05:24.707 --> 00:05:26.136
We asked them to pay attention

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.080
to what side of the foot
was contacting the ball.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.136
We showed that performance
was slower and more error-prone

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.696
when we drew their attention
to the step-by-step details

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.960
of what they were doing.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.056
When the pressure is on,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.216
we're often concerned
with performing at our best,

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.696
and as a result we try and control
what we're doing

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.096
to force the best performance.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.760
The end result
is that we actually screw up.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.376
In basketball,

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.640
the term "unconscious" is used
to describe a shooter who can't miss.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.016
And San Antonio Spurs star
Tim Duncan has said,

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.896
"When you have to stop and think,
that's when you mess up."

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.656
In dance, the great choreographer,
George Balanchine,

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.496
used to urge his dancers,

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.880
"Don't think, just do."

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.296
When the pressure's on,

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.856
when we want to put our best foot forward,

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.096
somewhat ironically,

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.960
we often try and control what we're doing
in a way that leads to worse performance.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.656
So what do we do?

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.336
Knowing that we have
this overactive attention,

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.800
how do we ensure
that we perform at our best?

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.216
A lot of it comes down
to the prefrontal cortex,

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.296
that front part of our brain
that sits over our eyes

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.296
and usually helps us
focus in positive ways.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.216
It often gets hooked on the wrong things.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.800
So how do we unhook it?

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.240
Something as simple as singing a song,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.336
or paying attention to one's pinky toe,

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.576
as pro golfer Jack Nicklaus
was rumored to do,

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.960
can help us take our mind
off those pesky details.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.976
It's also true that practicing
under conditions

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.176
that we're going to perform under --

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.336
closing the gap between
training and competition

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.000
can help us get used
to that feeling of all eyes on us.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.776
This is true off
the playing field as well.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.800
Whether it's getting ready for an exam

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.256
or preparing for a big talk --

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.136
one that might have
a little pressure associated with it --

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.256
(Laughter)

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.536
getting used to the types of situations
you're going to perform under

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.016
really matters.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.536
When you're taking a test, close the book,

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.496
practice retrieving the answer
from memory under timed situations,

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.016
and when you're giving a talk,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.536
practice in front of others.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.056
And if you can't find anyone
who will listen,

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.256
practice in front of a video camera
or even a mirror.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.416
The ability to get used to what it will
feel like can make the difference

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.480
in whether we choke or thrive.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.736
We've also figured out some ways
to get rid of those pesky worries

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.216
and self-doubts that tend to creep up
in the stressful situations.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.696
Researchers have shown that simply
jotting down your thoughts and worries

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.496
before a stressful event

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:17.136
can help to download them from mind --

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.280
make them less likely
to pop up in the moment.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.696
It's kind of like when you wake up
in the middle of the night

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.816
and you're really worried
about what you have to do the next day,

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.816
you're trying to think about
everything you have to accomplish,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.496
and you write it down
and then you can go back to sleep.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.056
Journaling, or getting
those thoughts down on paper,

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.056
makes it less likely they'll pop up
and distract you in the moment.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.000
The end result is that you can
perform your best when it matters most.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.616
So up until now,

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.655
I've talked about what happens
when we put limits on ourselves

00:08:50.679 --> 00:08:54.320
and some tips we can use
to help perform up to our potential.

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:56.616
But it's important to remember

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.736
that it's not just
our own individual being

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.696
that can put limits
and that can perform poorly;

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.736
our environment has an effect
on whether we choke or thrive.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.696
Our parents, our teachers,
our coaches, our bosses all influence

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.680
whether or not we can put our best
foot forward when it matters most.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.120
Take math as an example.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.736
That's right, I said it:

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.176
math.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.896
Lots of people profess to choke
or are anxious about doing math,

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.016
whether it's taking a test or even
calculating the tip on a dinner bill

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.320
as our smart friends look on.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.016
And it's quite socially acceptable

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.616
to talk about choking
or performing poorly in math.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.656
You don't hear highly educated people
walking around talking about the fact

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.576
or bragging about the fact
that they're not good readers,

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:53.760
but you hear people all the time bragging
about how they're not math people.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.936
And unfortunately,

00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.096
in the US, this tends to be
more so among girls and women

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.520
than boys and men.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.096
My research team and I
have tried to understand

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.496
where this fear of math comes from,

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.656
and we've actually peered
inside the brains

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.416
using functional magnetic
resonance imaging,

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.016
of people who are worried about math.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:22.536
We've shown that math phobia correlates
with a concrete visceral sensation

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.896
such as pain,

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.176
of which we have
every right to feel anxious.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.896
In fact, when people
who are worried about math

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.656
are just getting ready
to take a math test --

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.376
they're not even taking it,
they're just getting ready --

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:41.856
areas of the brain known the be involved
in our neural pain response are active.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.376
When we say math is painful,

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.640
there's some truth to it for some people.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.856
But where does this
math anxiety come from?

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.536
It turns out that math
anxiety is contagious.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.976
When adults are worried about math,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.440
the children around them
start worrying, too.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.336
As young as first grade,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.856
when kids are in classrooms

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.416
with teachers who are anxious
about their own math ability,

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.040
these kids learn less
across the school year.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.680
And it turns out that this
is more prevalent in girls than boys.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:17.776
At this young age,

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.096
kids tend to mimic same-sex adults,

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.656
and at least in the US,

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.600
over 90 percent of our elementary
school teachers are women.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.040
Of course, it's not just
what happens in the classroom.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.736
Social media plays a big role here, too.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.536
It wasn't so long ago

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.576
that you could purchase a Teen Talk Barbie

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.056
that when the cord was pulled,

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.776
it would say things like,

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.336
"Will we ever have enough clothes?"

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.360
and "Math class is tough."

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.616
And just a few years ago,

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.536
major retailers were marketing
T-shirts at our young girls

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.120
that read things like,
"I'm too pretty to do math,"

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.960
or, "I'm too pretty to do my homework
so my brother does it for me."

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.096
And let's not forget about the parents.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.440
Oh, the parents.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.416
It turns out that when parents are worried
about their own math ability

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.936
and they help their kids a lot
with math homework,

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.400
their kids learn less math
across the school year.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.776
As one parent put it,

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.056
"I judge my first grader's math homework

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.736
by whether it's a one-glass assignment
or a three-glass night."

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.880
(Laughter)

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.936
When adults are anxious
about their own math ability,

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.536
it rubs off on their kids

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.040
and it affects whether
they choke or thrive.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.216
But just as we can put limits on others,

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.176
we can take them off.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.856
My research team and I have shown

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.096
that when we help parents
do fun math activities with their kids --

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.256
rather than, say, just doing
bedtime stories or bedtime reading,

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.256
they do bedtime math,

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.360
which are fun story problems
to do with your kids at night,

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.336
not only do children's attitudes
about math improve,

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.280
but their math performance
across the school year improves as well.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.080
Our environment matters.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.976
From the classroom to parents to media,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.600
and it can really make a difference
in terms of whether we choke or thrive.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:28.136
Fast-forward from
my high school soccer game

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.840
to my freshman year in college.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.176
I was in the chemistry sequence
for science majors,

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.480
and boy did I not belong.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.920
Even though I studied
for my first midterm exam --

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.896
I thought I was ready to go --

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.120
I bombed it.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:51.880
I literally got the worst grade
in a class of 400 students.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.296
I was convinced I wasn't going
to be a science major,

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.749
that maybe I was dropping
out of college altogether.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.560
But then I changed how I studied.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.376
Instead of studying alone,

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.656
I started studying with a group of friends

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.976
who at the end of the study session
would close their book

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.960
and compete for the right answer.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.520
We learned to practice under stress.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.176
If you could've looked inside my brain
during that first midterm exam,

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.976
you likely would've seen
a neural pain response

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.760
a lot like the math-anxious
individuals I study.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.400
It was probably there during
the stressful study situation as well.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.576
But when I walked into the final,

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.336
my mind was quiet,

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:38.120
and I actually got one of the highest
grades in the entire class.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.616
It wasn't just
about learning the material;

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:48.800
it was about learning how to overcome
my limits when it mattered most.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.856
What happens in our heads really matters,

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.080
and knowing this,

00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:00.776
we can learn how to prepare ourselves
and others for success,

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.856
not just on the playing field
but in the boardroom

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.896
and in the classroom as well.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.136
Thank you.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.720
(Applause)
