00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:16.247
Listen to the sounds
of why hearing matters

00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:17.941
to the Alaskan Native people.

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:22.573
Hearing loss makes it hard
to fish on the open water,

00:00:22.597 --> 00:00:25.605
hunt caribou and harvest berries,

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:28.885
activities central
to Alaskan Native culture.

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.558
Hearing loss isn't unique to rural Alaska.

00:00:33.582 --> 00:00:34.800
It's global.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.469
The Global Burden of Disease Project
estimates there are 1.1 billion people

00:00:41.493 --> 00:00:43.758
living with hearing loss worldwide.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.476
That's more people than the entire
population here in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:00:50.198 --> 00:00:54.036
Over 80 percent are in low-
and middle-income countries,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.457
and many have no access to hearing care.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.544
The impact on people's lives
is tremendous.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.034
Anuk is a three-year-old boy
I treated in Alaska.

00:01:07.596 --> 00:01:11.301
Ear infections started
when he was barely four months old.

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:13.989
His parents brought him into clinic,

00:01:14.013 --> 00:01:17.225
worried he didn't say much
compared to his brothers.

00:01:17.828 --> 00:01:23.089
Sure enough, many rounds of infections
had resulted in hearing loss.

00:01:23.772 --> 00:01:29.211
Without treatment, Anuk's speech
will continue to lag behind.

00:01:29.235 --> 00:01:32.015
He's more likely to do worse in school,

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.044
have worse job prospects

00:01:34.068 --> 00:01:36.613
and experience social isolation.

00:01:37.247 --> 00:01:39.563
But it doesn't have to be this way.

00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:45.473
The World Health Organization estimates
that half of all global hearing loss

00:01:45.497 --> 00:01:47.022
can be prevented.

00:01:47.752 --> 00:01:52.154
If Anuk's hearing loss
is identified and treated promptly,

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:57.027
his life and the opportunities
he has as he grows up

00:01:57.051 --> 00:01:58.950
could look vastly different.

00:01:59.998 --> 00:02:03.422
I'm an ear surgeon working
with partners around the world

00:02:03.446 --> 00:02:06.222
on new pathways
for hearing loss prevention.

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:11.566
This solution comes from my collaboration
with a tribal health organization

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.530
called the Norton Sound
Health Corporation.

00:02:14.554 --> 00:02:18.901
Hearing loss evaluation traditionally
requires testing by an audiologist

00:02:18.925 --> 00:02:20.494
in a soundproof room,

00:02:20.518 --> 00:02:22.787
with a lot of permanent equipment.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.886
An ear surgeon then examines
Anuk's ears under a microscope

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.599
and decides a treatment plan.

00:02:29.083 --> 00:02:32.434
These resources simply aren't
available in remote settings.

00:02:33.093 --> 00:02:37.748
In a state where 75 percent of communities
aren't connected to a hospital

00:02:37.772 --> 00:02:38.929
by road,

00:02:38.953 --> 00:02:41.361
an expensive flight is required.

00:02:42.023 --> 00:02:45.374
To overcome these barriers,
Alaska has developed

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:48.076
a state-of-the-art telemedicine system

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.338
that connects over 250
village health clinics

00:02:51.362 --> 00:02:55.173
with specialists who triage
all types of health concerns.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.846
My colleagues have validated
that ear-related telemedicine consults

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.599
are equivalent to an in-person exam.

00:03:03.331 --> 00:03:08.341
In 2016, travel was prevented
for 91 percent of patients

00:03:08.365 --> 00:03:11.898
receiving specialty telemedicine
in the Norton Sound region.

00:03:12.365 --> 00:03:17.651
Telemedicine has saved over 18 million
in travel costs in this single region

00:03:17.675 --> 00:03:19.737
over the past 15 years.

00:03:20.474 --> 00:03:24.182
Our team is taking the power
of telemedicine to a new level,

00:03:24.206 --> 00:03:25.364
through a project

00:03:25.388 --> 00:03:28.689
funded by the Patient-Centered
Outcomes Research Institute.

00:03:28.713 --> 00:03:31.690
For the first time,
we are merging telemedicine

00:03:31.714 --> 00:03:34.317
with mobile screening technology

00:03:34.341 --> 00:03:38.632
that extends the reach of expert triage
beyond health care settings.

00:03:39.068 --> 00:03:42.610
This cell-based screen,
developed in South Africa,

00:03:42.634 --> 00:03:46.121
costs over 10 times less
than traditional equipment

00:03:46.145 --> 00:03:48.685
and does not require advanced training.

00:03:49.258 --> 00:03:51.942
If I were screening Anuk at school,

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:54.975
sound-attenuating headphones
and noise monitoring

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:57.255
would take the place of a sound booth,

00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:59.926
and I would use a phone adapter
instead of a microscope

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.478
to examine his ears.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.030
In a matter of minutes,
screening and images are done.

00:04:06.054 --> 00:04:08.870
We then apply Alaska
telemedicine technology

00:04:08.894 --> 00:04:11.447
to transmit the data to specialists,

00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:14.222
who connect Anuk
to the treatment he needs.

00:04:14.944 --> 00:04:17.878
Our team is launching a randomized trial

00:04:17.902 --> 00:04:20.418
in 15 communities along the Bering Sea

00:04:20.442 --> 00:04:23.271
to study how well this intervention works.

00:04:24.008 --> 00:04:28.998
Our goal is to prevent childhood
hearing loss across the state of Alaska.

00:04:29.522 --> 00:04:32.656
But the concept is bigger
than a single state.

00:04:32.722 --> 00:04:35.005
The impact is global.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.560
Mobile telemedicine
can revolutionize access to care.

00:04:40.354 --> 00:04:45.513
In Malawi, for example, there are only
two ear surgeons and 11 audiologists

00:04:45.537 --> 00:04:48.053
for a population of 17 million.

00:04:48.506 --> 00:04:52.796
This technology could empower teachers
and community health workers

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.210
to provide access to care
to children in places like Malawi.

00:04:57.767 --> 00:05:01.218
Scaling up globally
could change children's lives

00:05:01.242 --> 00:05:04.488
who have never had access
to hearing care before,

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:07.541
using just the power of a cell phone.

00:05:08.418 --> 00:05:11.871
It's time to change the course
of preventable hearing loss.

00:05:12.383 --> 00:05:16.729
Anuk and countless children like him
are depending on us.

00:05:16.753 --> 00:05:17.908
Thank you.

00:05:17.932 --> 00:05:21.488
(Applause)
