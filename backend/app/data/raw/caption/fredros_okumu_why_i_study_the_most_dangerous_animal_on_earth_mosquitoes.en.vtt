00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.576
I guess because I'm from Tanzania

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.280
I have a responsibility
to welcome all of you once again.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.736
Thank you for coming.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.416
So, first of all, before we start,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.936
how many of you in the audience

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.720
have been in the past
a victim of this bug here?

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.216
We apologize on behalf
of all the mosquito catchers.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.056
(Laughter)

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.336
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.960
imagine getting seven infectious
mosquito bites every day.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.400
That's 2,555 infectious bites every year.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.976
When I was in college,
I moved to the Kilombero River valley

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.656
in the southeastern part of Tanzania.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.816
This is historically
one of the most malarious zones

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.536
in the world at that time.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.000
Life here was difficult.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.776
In its later stages

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.600
malaria manifested with extreme seizures
locally known as degedege.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.056
It's killed both women and men,
adults and children,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.856
without mercy.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.176
My home institution,
Ifakara Health Institute,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.176
began in this valley in the 1950s

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.280
to address priority health needs
for the local communities.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.480
In fact, the name Ifakara
refers to a place you go to die,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.696
which is a reflection
of what life used to be here

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.320
in the days before
organized public health care.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.496
When I first moved here,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.016
my primary role was to estimate

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.560
how much malaria transmission
was going on across the villages

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.920
and which mosquitoes
were transmitting the disease.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.096
So my colleague and myself came

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.200
30 kilometers south
of Ifakara town across the river.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.136
Every evening we went into the villages
with flashlights and siphons.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.720
We rolled up our trousers,

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.696
and waited for mosquitoes
that were coming to bite us

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.296
so we could collect them

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.178
to check if they were carrying malaria.

00:01:58.202 --> 00:01:59.216
(Laughter)

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.416
My colleague and myself
selected a household,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.280
and we started inside and outside,
swapping positions every half hour.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.200
And we did this for 12 hours every night
for 24 consecutive nights.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.576
We slept for four hours every morning

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.096
and worked the rest of the day,

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.136
sorting mosquitoes, identifying them
and chopping off their heads

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.896
so they could be analyzed in the lab

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.175
to check if they were
carrying malaria parasites

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:23.776
in their blood mouthparts.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.776
This way we were able to not only know
how much malaria was going on here

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.696
but also which mosquitoes
were carrying this malaria.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.976
We were also able to know

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.776
whether malaria was mostly
inside houses or outside houses.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.960
Today, ladies and gentlemen,
I still catch mosquitoes for a living.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.360
But I do this mostly to improve
people's lives and well-being.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.576
This has been called by some people
the most dangerous animal on earth --

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.656
which unfortunately is true.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.240
But what do we really
know about mosquitoes?

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.760
It turns out we actually know very little.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.416
Consider the fact that at the moment
our best practice against malaria

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.216
are bednets --
insecticide treated bednets.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.816
We know now that across Africa

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.776
you have widespread resistance
to insecticides.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.536
And these are the same insecticides,

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.000
the pyrethroid class,
that are put on these bednets.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.656
We know now that these bednets
protect you from bites

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.560
but only minimally kill
the mosquitoes that they should.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.216
What it means is that we've got to do more
to be able to get to zero.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.760
And that's part of our duty.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.256
At Ifakara Health Institute

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.456
we focus very much
on the biology of the mosquito,

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.176
and we try to do this
so we can identify new opportunities.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.536
A new approach.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.416
New ways to try and get new options

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.936
that we can use together
with things such as bednets

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.256
to be able to get to zero.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.456
And I'm going to share
with you a few examples

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.680
of the things that
my colleagues and myself do.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.216
Take this, for example.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.080
Mosquitoes breed in small pools of water.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.016
Not all of them are easy to find --

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.296
they can be scattered across villages,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.840
they can be as small as hoofprints.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.616
They can be behind your house
or far from your house.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.216
And so, if you wanted
to control mosquito larvae,

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.640
it can actually be
quite difficult to get them.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.760
What my colleagues
and I have decided to do

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.216
is to think about what if
we used mosquitoes themselves

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.336
to carry the insecticides
from a place of our choice

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.256
to their own breeding habitats

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.880
so that whichever eggs
they lay there shall not survive.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.055
This is Dickson Lwetoijera.

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:32.776
This is my colleague
who runs this show at Ifakara.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.056
And he has demonstrated cleverly
that you can actually get mosquitoes

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.816
to come to the place
where they normally come to get blood

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.896
to pick up a dose
of sterilants or insecticide,

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.056
carry this back
to their own breeding habitat

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.680
and kill all their progeny.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.136
And we have demonstrated
that you can do this

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.440
and crush populations very, very rapidly.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.160
This is beautiful.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.720
This is our mosquito city.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.256
It is the largest mosquito farm

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.560
available in the world
for malaria research.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.056
Here we have large-scale self-sustaining
colonies of malaria mosquitoes

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.696
that we rear in these facilities.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.536
Of course, they are disease-free.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.376
But what these systems allow us to do

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.056
is to introduce new tools
and test them immediately,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.296
very quickly,

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.640
and see if we can crush these populations
or control them in some way.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.776
And my colleagues have demonstrated

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.976
that if you just put
two or three positions

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.936
where mosquitoes can go
pick up these lethal substances,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.400
we can crush these colonies
in just three months.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.480
That's autodissemination, as we call it.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.960
But what if we could use

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.840
the mosquitoes' sexual behavior

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.816
to also control them?

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.816
So, first of all I would like to tell you

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.080
that actually mosquitoes mate
in what we call swarms.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.856
Male mosquitoes usually congregate

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.080
in clusters around the horizon,
usually after sunset.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.616
The males go there for a dance,

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.296
the females fly into that dance

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.056
and select a male mosquito
of their choice,

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.856
usually the best-looking
male in their view.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.256
They clump together
and fall down onto the floor.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.936
If you watch this, it's beautiful.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.976
It's a fantastic phenomenon.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.216
This is where our mosquito-catching
work gets really interesting.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.936
What we have seen, when we go
swarm hunting in the villages,

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.496
is that these swarm locations
tend to be at exactly the same location

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.976
every day, every week, every month,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.536
year in, year out.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.736
They start at exactly
the same time of the evening,

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.176
and they are at exactly
the same locations.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.456
What does this tell us?

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.736
It means that if we can map
all these locations across villages,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.376
we could actually

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.536
crush these populations
by just a single blow.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.520
Kind of, you know, bomb-spray them
or nuke them out.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.016
And that is what we try to do
with young men and women

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.256
across the villages.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.480
We organize these crews, teach them
how to identify the swarms,

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.736
and spray them out.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.376
My colleagues and I believe
we have a new window

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.320
to get mosquitoes out of the valley.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.800
But perhaps the fact that mosquitoes
eat blood, human blood,

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.480
is the reason they are
the most dangerous animal on earth.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.216
But think about it this way --

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.960
mosquitoes actually smell you.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.256
And they have developed

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.320
incredible sensory organs.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.440
They can smell from as far
sometimes as 100 meters away.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.296
And when they get closer,

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.296
they can even tell the difference
between two family members.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.536
They know who you are
based on what you produce

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.760
from your breath, skin,
sweat and body odor.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.776
What we have done at Ifakara

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.456
is to identify what it is in your skin,
your body, your sweat or your breath

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.766
that these mosquitoes like.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.336
Once we identified these substances,
we created a concoction,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.496
kind of a mixture,
a blend of synthetic substances

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.176
that are reminiscent
of what you produce from your body.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.376
And we made a synthetic blend

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.480
that was attracting three to five times
more mosquitoes than a human being.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.696
What can you do with this?

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.976
You put in a trap, lure a lot
of mosquitoes and you kill them, right?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.456
And of course, you can also
use it for surveillance.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.256
At Ifakara

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.360
we wish to expand our knowledge
on the biology of the mosquito;

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.216
to control many other diseases,
including, of course, the malaria,

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.816
but also those other diseases
that mosquitoes transmit

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.040
like dengue, Chikungunya and Zika virus.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.936
And this is why my colleagues,
for example --

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.216
we have looked at the fact

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.816
that some mosquitoes
like to bite you on the leg region.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.800
And we've now created
these mosquito repellent sandals

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.960
that tourists and locals can wear
when they're coming.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.896
And you don't get bitten --

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.920
this gives you 'round the clock protection

00:08:36.944 --> 00:08:39.096
until the time you go under your bednet.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.976
(Applause)

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.576
My love-hate relationship
with mosquitoes continues.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.696
(Laughter)

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.216
And it's going to go
a long way, I can see.

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.696
But that's OK.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.856
WHO has set a goal of 2030
to eliminate malaria from 35 countries.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.456
The African Union has set a goal

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.616
of 2030 to eliminate malaria
from the continent.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.256
At Ifakara we are firmly
behind these goals.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.616
And we've put together
a cohort of young scientists,

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.176
male and female,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.416
who are champions,

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.880
who are interested in coming together
to make this vision come true.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.696
They do what they can

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.000
to make it work.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.496
And we are supporting them.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.456
We are here to make sure
that these dreams come true.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.176
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:26.040
even if it doesn't happen in our lifetime,

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.560
even if it doesn't happen

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.256
before you and me go away,

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.840
I believe that your child and my child

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.856
shall inherit a world
free of malaria transmitting mosquitoes

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.096
and free of malaria.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.136
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.056
(Applause)

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.336
Thank you.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.720
Kelo Kubu: OK, Fredros.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.616
Let's talk about CRISPR for a bit.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.056
(Laughter)

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.336
It's taken the world by storm,

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.360
it promises to do amazing things.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.840
What do you think of scientists
using CRISPR to kill off mosquitoes?

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:07.160
Fredros Okumu: To answer this question,
let's start from what the problem is.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.256
First of all, we're talking
about a disease that still kills --

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.696
according to the latest figures
we have from WHO --

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.936
429,000 people.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.720
Most of these are African children.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.096
Of course, we've made progress,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.976
there are countries that have achieved

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.600
up to 50-60 percent reduction
in malaria burden.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:29.000
But we still have to do more
to get to zero.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.536
There is already proof of principle

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.776
that gene-editing techniques,
such as CRISPR,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.416
can be used effectively

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.040
to transform mosquitoes so that
either they do not transmit malaria --

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.776
we call this population alteration --

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.880
or that they no longer exist,

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.496
population suppression.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.416
This is already proven in the lab.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.856
There is also modeling work

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.456
that has demonstrated
that even if you were to release

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.576
just a small number of these
genetically modified mosquitoes,

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.896
that you can actually achieve
elimination very, very quickly.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.856
So, CRISPR and tools like this
offer us some real opportunities --

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.856
real-life opportunities
to have high-impact interventions

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.576
that we can use
in addition to what we have now

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.256
to eventually go to zero.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.936
This is important.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.936
Now, of course people always ask us --

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.296
which is a common question,

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.376
I guess you're going
to ask this as well --

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.456
"What happens if you
eliminate mosquitoes?"

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.096
KK: I won't ask then, you answer.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.176
FO: OK. In respect to this,
I would just like to remind my colleagues

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.616
that we have 3,500
mosquito species in this world.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.936
Maybe more than that.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.976
About 400 of these are Anophelenes,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.856
and only about 70 of them
have any capacity to transmit malaria.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.656
In Africa, we're having to deal with
three or four of these as the major guys.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.496
They carry most -- like 99 percent
of all the malaria we have.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.416
If we were to go out
with gene editing like CRISPR,

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.136
if we were to go out
with gene drives to control malaria,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.256
we would be going after only one or two.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.776
I don't see a diversity problem with that.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.176
But that's personal view.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.416
I think it's OK.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.696
And remember, by the way,

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.416
all these years we've been trying
to eliminate these mosquitoes effectively

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.496
by spraying them -- our colleagues
in America have sprayed with --

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.136
really bomb-spraying
these insects out of the villages.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.096
In Africa we do a lot
of household spraying.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.800
All these are aimed
solely at killing the mosquitoes.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.776
So there's really no problem
if we had a new tool.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.496
But having said that, I have to say

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.816
we also have to be
very, very responsible here.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.296
So there's the regulatory side,
and we have to partner with our regulators

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.296
and make sure that everything
that we do is done correctly,

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.936
is done responsibly

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.656
and that we also have to do
independent risk assessments,

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.936
to just make sure

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.216
that all these processes
do not fall into the wrong hands.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.456
Thank you very much.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.696
KK: Thank you.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.080
(Applause)
