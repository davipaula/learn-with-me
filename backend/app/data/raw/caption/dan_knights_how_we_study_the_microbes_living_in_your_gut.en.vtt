00:00:12.787 --> 00:00:18.301
If I asked you to name a microbe
that's living in your gut,

00:00:18.325 --> 00:00:21.676
many of you would probably say E. coli.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.465
A lot of people say this.
It's the best-known of the gut microbes.

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:29.994
But it turns out that E. coli
is outnumbered in your gut

00:00:30.018 --> 00:00:32.111
about a thousand to one

00:00:32.135 --> 00:00:35.126
by other species, many of which
you probably haven't heard of.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.731
These are Bacteroides;
Prevotella is another example.

00:00:39.755 --> 00:00:43.223
Those are the two that dominate
the modern human gut.

00:00:43.247 --> 00:00:48.096
There are about a hundred trillion
microbes living inside you.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.361
We call this your microbiome,

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:54.629
so it's like a little world
living inside you --

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:56.527
actually more like a universe.

00:00:56.896 --> 00:01:00.350
A hundred trillion means
if you took a blade of grass

00:01:00.374 --> 00:01:03.499
and planted it for every microbe
living in your gut,

00:01:03.523 --> 00:01:05.877
that could fill a million football fields.

00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:07.647
So it's incredibly complex.

00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:09.487
But interestingly,

00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:13.944
as our bodies have been adapting
to life in modern society,

00:01:13.968 --> 00:01:18.072
we're losing some of our normal microbes,

00:01:18.096 --> 00:01:21.021
and at the same time,

00:01:21.045 --> 00:01:24.400
there are quite a few diseases
related to the gut

00:01:24.424 --> 00:01:29.853
that are skyrocketing
in developed nations all around the world.

00:01:29.877 --> 00:01:34.536
And many of you probably know
someone who suffers from obesity,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.521
diabetes, Crohn's disease
or ulcerative colitis,

00:01:38.545 --> 00:01:40.440
allergies and asthma.

00:01:40.464 --> 00:01:41.829
Every one of these diseases

00:01:41.853 --> 00:01:46.100
and many others related to metabolism
and autoimmunity

00:01:46.124 --> 00:01:51.243
are linked to a loss
of healthy diversity in the gut.

00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:54.272
My lab got our first indication of this

00:01:54.296 --> 00:01:58.066
when actually we were studying
non-human primates.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.221
We wanted to find out what happens
to a monkey's microbiome

00:02:03.245 --> 00:02:07.284
when they move from the jungle to a zoo.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:10.738
Does their microbiome change?
Do they pick up new bugs?

00:02:10.762 --> 00:02:13.503
Do they lose some?
Does it get better or worse?

00:02:13.527 --> 00:02:17.041
We tracked two different
species in the jungle,

00:02:17.065 --> 00:02:20.675
one in Vietnam, one in Costa Rica,

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:23.580
and then we sequenced
the DNA from their stool.

00:02:23.604 --> 00:02:27.145
This is how we study the microbiome
in my research lab.

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:31.281
And what we found in the DNA
is that in the wild,

00:02:31.305 --> 00:02:35.266
these two species had
totally different sets of microbes.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.902
It was like a fingerprint for the species.

00:02:37.926 --> 00:02:43.091
But in the zoo, they had lost
most of that diversity

00:02:43.115 --> 00:02:45.646
and had acquired
some other set of microbes.

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.727
So this was very curious.

00:02:49.751 --> 00:02:51.760
We've got these two different microbiomes.

00:02:51.784 --> 00:02:55.942
In the wild, picture a lush
tropical rainforest

00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:58.435
living the guts of these monkeys.

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.999
That's the kind of diversity
that we're talking about.

00:03:01.023 --> 00:03:03.649
Then in the zoo, they've lost diversity.

00:03:04.298 --> 00:03:07.870
Picture a rainforest
that's been burned to the ground

00:03:07.894 --> 00:03:10.234
and taken over by a few invasive species.

00:03:11.105 --> 00:03:14.906
That's more like the microbiome
in a captive primate.

00:03:15.955 --> 00:03:17.192
Now, in the meantime,

00:03:17.216 --> 00:03:19.843
many of the animals in the zoo
are not doing so well.

00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:22.773
They have issues with obesity,

00:03:22.797 --> 00:03:24.133
wasting,

00:03:24.157 --> 00:03:27.206
gastroenteritis, diarrhea, bloating,

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.039
and some of them were barely
holding onto their lives.

00:03:31.073 --> 00:03:34.661
Now, of course, we were
very interested to find out

00:03:34.685 --> 00:03:39.039
what are these so-called invasive species
that are taking over in the zoo.

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:42.788
So we went back to the DNA,
and what the DNA told us

00:03:42.812 --> 00:03:47.315
is that every monkey in the zoo

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:52.507
had become dominated
by Bacteroides and Prevotella,

00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:56.912
the same microbes that we all have
in our guts as modern humans.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.943
We wanted to find a way to visualize this,

00:04:01.967 --> 00:04:05.907
and we used some tools
from multivariate ecology

00:04:05.931 --> 00:04:10.343
to put all of the microbiomes
we were studying onto an axis.

00:04:10.367 --> 00:04:14.437
And what you're seeing here
is a distance plot

00:04:14.461 --> 00:04:19.366
where every point
is a different animal's microbiome.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.183
So every point represents
a whole zoo of microbes.

00:04:23.207 --> 00:04:27.063
And the microbiomes
that have a lot of microbes in common

00:04:27.087 --> 00:04:28.500
are close to each other.

00:04:28.524 --> 00:04:30.972
The ones that are very different
are farther apart.

00:04:30.996 --> 00:04:32.513
So this is showing you

00:04:32.537 --> 00:04:38.235
that the two groups of wild monkeys
are over on the left.

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:42.031
The top left are these
highly endangered monkeys

00:04:42.055 --> 00:04:45.028
called the red-shanked douc in Vietnam.

00:04:45.052 --> 00:04:48.683
And at the bottom left
are monkeys from Costa Rica.

00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:52.925
So you can see that they have
totally different microbiomes in the wild.

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:58.346
And then the same two species
of monkey in the zoo are converging,

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.252
so their microbiomes change

00:05:00.276 --> 00:05:03.496
and they become
much more similar to each other,

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.193
even though these are zoos
on different continents,

00:05:06.217 --> 00:05:09.559
different geographical regions,
and they're eating different diets.

00:05:09.583 --> 00:05:12.744
Now, we did study
some other species of primate.

00:05:12.768 --> 00:05:18.507
What species of primate
do you think is even more divergent

00:05:18.531 --> 00:05:22.197
from the wild primates
than the captive primates?

00:05:24.665 --> 00:05:26.094
Modern humans.

00:05:27.049 --> 00:05:30.532
These are humans
living in developing nations.

00:05:30.556 --> 00:05:33.699
So they were more different
from the wild primates

00:05:33.723 --> 00:05:35.644
than those in the zoo.

00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:41.049
And the final group that we studied,
all the way on the right,

00:05:41.073 --> 00:05:43.017
is people living in the USA.

00:05:44.033 --> 00:05:46.881
And when I saw this figure,

00:05:46.905 --> 00:05:50.006
the hairs raised up
on the back of my neck,

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.117
because one way to think about it is,
"Oh, that's interesting,

00:05:53.141 --> 00:05:57.085
captive monkeys are sort of on their way
to becoming like Americans."

00:05:57.109 --> 00:05:58.196
(Laughter)

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.616
But the other way to think about it

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.989
is that Americans
are like super-captive monkeys.

00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:09.369
And I was actually looking
at this figure on my computer screen

00:06:09.393 --> 00:06:14.321
when I got the news
that four of the red-shanked doucs

00:06:14.345 --> 00:06:17.449
had died in the zoo of gut-related issues.

00:06:17.473 --> 00:06:19.441
So for some of these animals,

00:06:19.465 --> 00:06:22.163
having the right microbes
living inside them

00:06:22.187 --> 00:06:24.157
may be a matter of survival.

00:06:24.181 --> 00:06:27.688
Now this brings us
to the human part of the story.

00:06:27.712 --> 00:06:30.927
Obviously, the microbiomes in the USA

00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:36.452
aren't causing premature death
as frequently as in the zoo,

00:06:36.476 --> 00:06:40.850
but we have major risk
of obesity, diabetes,

00:06:40.874 --> 00:06:42.771
a number of these other diseases.

00:06:43.133 --> 00:06:47.553
And this applies not just to people
who have been living in the USA

00:06:47.577 --> 00:06:49.561
for many generations,

00:06:49.585 --> 00:06:52.021
but also to immigrants and refugees,

00:06:52.045 --> 00:06:55.727
who, for most immigrant
and refugee groups,

00:06:55.751 --> 00:06:58.852
arrive in the USA metabolically healthy,

00:06:58.876 --> 00:07:00.256
and then within a few years,

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.638
they become just as high-risk
for obesity and diabetes

00:07:03.662 --> 00:07:05.743
as other Americans.

00:07:05.767 --> 00:07:09.465
And we discussed
this issue with two groups

00:07:09.489 --> 00:07:12.036
that have been coming to the USA
from Southeast Asia:

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.254
the Hmong, who started coming
in the mid-1970s

00:07:16.278 --> 00:07:21.778
as refugees from the Vietnam War
and the US secret war in Laos;

00:07:21.802 --> 00:07:26.714
and the Karen, who have been coming
more recently as refugees from Myanmar.

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:28.516
So we've been working for a few years

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.081
with these local
communities and clinicians

00:07:31.105 --> 00:07:36.522
to study what happens
to the Hmong and Karen microbiomes

00:07:36.546 --> 00:07:43.542
when people move from refugee camps
and villages in Thailand to the USA.

00:07:44.314 --> 00:07:45.878
And what we found

00:07:45.902 --> 00:07:51.613
is that when people
come to the USA from these groups,

00:07:51.637 --> 00:07:55.033
they lose a large fraction
of their microbiome,

00:07:56.343 --> 00:07:58.120
somewhere around 20 percent,

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:02.413
and those who come to the USA
and become obese

00:08:02.437 --> 00:08:04.390
lose about a third of their microbes.

00:08:06.905 --> 00:08:08.857
So we know that moving to the USA

00:08:08.881 --> 00:08:12.874
is sufficient to cause
a dramatic change in your microbiome,

00:08:12.898 --> 00:08:14.667
probably not for the better.

00:08:15.571 --> 00:08:20.429
Are these microbes
actually causing the obesity,

00:08:20.453 --> 00:08:23.913
or is the obesity causing
a change in the microbes?

00:08:23.937 --> 00:08:26.080
This is something
that we're following up on,

00:08:26.104 --> 00:08:29.746
and the evidence we have now in my lab

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.880
combined with evidence
from a number of labs around the world

00:08:32.904 --> 00:08:35.976
tells us that certain changes
in the microbiome

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.509
do lead to obesity,

00:08:38.533 --> 00:08:41.984
and a number of other modern,
kind of Westernized diseases.

00:08:43.353 --> 00:08:48.662
The good news is that
your microbiome can actually change.

00:08:48.686 --> 00:08:51.209
Unlike your own genome,

00:08:51.233 --> 00:08:53.582
it's a living, breathing thing,

00:08:53.606 --> 00:08:57.137
and there's a broad front
of research happening right now

00:08:57.161 --> 00:09:00.955
to better understand
how we can restore our microbiomes

00:09:00.979 --> 00:09:02.582
when something goes wrong,

00:09:02.606 --> 00:09:04.233
using diet,

00:09:04.257 --> 00:09:06.915
using live microbes.

00:09:06.939 --> 00:09:09.739
And in fact, one of the next steps for us

00:09:09.763 --> 00:09:14.351
is collecting and preserving microbes
from healthy people around the world

00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:19.930
so that they can be kept
as cultural assets for those groups

00:09:19.954 --> 00:09:24.795
to potentially protect them
as they adapt to modern society,

00:09:24.819 --> 00:09:27.273
and to protect future generations

00:09:27.297 --> 00:09:31.496
who are currently growing up
to have increased risk of these diseases

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.008
with every generation.

00:09:33.714 --> 00:09:36.316
I'm looking forward to a future

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:43.062
where we have the tools that we need
to restore and replenish our microbiomes,

00:09:43.562 --> 00:09:48.831
and in that world, the monkeys
will live happier and healthier lives,

00:09:48.855 --> 00:09:50.276
and so will we.

00:09:51.831 --> 00:09:55.507
(Applause)
