00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:17.151
When I was approximately
nine weeks pregnant with my first child,

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:20.651
I found out I'm a carrier
for a fatal genetic disorder

00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:22.341
called Tay-Sachs disease.

00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:24.291
What this means

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:28.204
is that one of the two copies
of chromosome number 15

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.141
that I have in each of my cells

00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:31.807
has a genetic mutation.

00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:35.490
Because I still have
one normal copy of this gene,

00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:37.580
the mutation doesn't affect me.

00:00:38.063 --> 00:00:41.904
But if a baby inherits this mutation
from both parents,

00:00:41.928 --> 00:00:46.237
if both copies of this particular gene
don't function properly,

00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:48.061
it results in Tay-Sachs,

00:00:48.085 --> 00:00:49.934
an incurable disease

00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.704
that progressively shuts down
the central nervous system

00:00:52.728 --> 00:00:55.116
and causes death by age five.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.800
For many pregnant women,
this news might produce a full-on panic.

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:03.478
But I knew something
that helped keep me calm

00:01:03.502 --> 00:01:06.625
when I heard this bombshell
about my own biology.

00:01:06.944 --> 00:01:08.365
I knew that my husband,

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:12.087
whose ancestry isn't Eastern
European Jewish like mine,

00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:13.770
had a very low likelihood

00:01:13.794 --> 00:01:17.110
of also being a carrier
for the Tay-Sachs mutation.

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:19.863
While the frequency of heterozygotes,

00:01:19.887 --> 00:01:22.656
individuals who have
one normal copy of the gene

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.347
and one mutated copy,

00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:30.355
is about one out of 27 people
among Jews of Ashkenazi descent, like me,

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:32.013
in most populations,

00:01:32.037 --> 00:01:36.275
only one in about 300 people
carry the Tay-Sachs mutation.

00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:40.363
Thankfully, it turned out I was right
not to worry too much.

00:01:40.387 --> 00:01:42.117
My husband isn't a carrier,

00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:45.324
and we now have two beautiful
and healthy children.

00:01:47.602 --> 00:01:48.753
As I said,

00:01:48.777 --> 00:01:50.308
because of my Jewish background,

00:01:50.332 --> 00:01:55.498
I was aware of the unusually high rate
of Tay-Sachs in the Ashkenazi population.

00:01:55.522 --> 00:01:59.141
But it wasn't until a few years
after my daughter was born

00:01:59.165 --> 00:02:03.212
when I created and taught a seminar
in evolutionary medicine at Harvard,

00:02:03.236 --> 00:02:04.831
that I thought to ask,

00:02:04.855 --> 00:02:07.220
and discovered a possible answer to,

00:02:07.244 --> 00:02:08.894
the question "why?"

00:02:09.252 --> 00:02:11.743
The process of evolution
by natural selection

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:14.429
typically eliminates harmful mutations.

00:02:14.776 --> 00:02:18.329
So how did this defective gene
persist at all?

00:02:18.353 --> 00:02:21.408
And why is it found
at such a high frequency

00:02:21.432 --> 00:02:23.699
within this particular population?

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:29.093
The perspective of evolutionary medicine
offers valuable insight,

00:02:29.117 --> 00:02:31.522
because it examines how and why

00:02:31.546 --> 00:02:35.442
humans' evolutionary past
has left our bodies vulnerable

00:02:35.466 --> 00:02:38.057
to diseases and other problems today.

00:02:38.716 --> 00:02:40.057
In doing so,

00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:44.272
it demonstrates that natural selection
doesn't always make our bodies better.

00:02:44.296 --> 00:02:46.025
It can't necessarily.

00:02:46.597 --> 00:02:49.394
But as I hope to illustrate
with my own story,

00:02:49.418 --> 00:02:52.934
understanding the implications
of your evolutionary past

00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.839
can help enrich your personal health.

00:02:57.148 --> 00:03:01.076
When I started investigating Tay-Sachs
using an evolutionary perspective,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.012
I came across an intriguing hypothesis.

00:03:04.401 --> 00:03:07.338
The unusually high rate
of the Tay-Sachs mutation

00:03:07.362 --> 00:03:09.704
in Ashkenazi Jews today

00:03:09.728 --> 00:03:13.561
may relate to advantages
the mutation gave this population

00:03:13.585 --> 00:03:14.735
in the past.

00:03:15.665 --> 00:03:17.506
Now I'm sure some of you are thinking,

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.498
"I'm sorry, did you just suggest
that this disease-causing mutation

00:03:21.522 --> 00:03:23.728
had beneficial effects?"

00:03:23.752 --> 00:03:25.149
Yeah, I did.

00:03:25.173 --> 00:03:28.824
Certainly not for individuals
who inherited two copies of the mutation

00:03:28.848 --> 00:03:30.466
and had Tay-Sachs.

00:03:30.847 --> 00:03:32.769
But under certain circumstances,

00:03:32.793 --> 00:03:33.959
people like me,

00:03:33.983 --> 00:03:37.107
who had only one faulty gene copy,

00:03:37.131 --> 00:03:41.004
may have been more likely
to survive, reproduce

00:03:41.028 --> 00:03:43.258
and pass on their genetic material,

00:03:43.282 --> 00:03:45.249
including that mutated gene.

00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:52.425
This idea that there can be circumstances
in which heterozygotes are better off

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.774
might sound familiar to some of you.

00:03:55.076 --> 00:03:57.966
Evolutionary biologists
call this phenomenon

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.260
heterozygote advantage.

00:04:00.284 --> 00:04:02.879
And it explains, for example,

00:04:02.903 --> 00:04:04.895
why carriers of sickle cell anemia

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:08.942
are more common among
some African and Asian populations

00:04:08.966 --> 00:04:12.101
or those with ancestry
from these tropical regions.

00:04:12.768 --> 00:04:17.791
In these geographic regions,
malaria poses significant risks to health.

00:04:18.546 --> 00:04:21.164
The parasite that causes malaria, though,

00:04:21.188 --> 00:04:26.688
can only complete its life cycle
in normal, round red blood cells.

00:04:27.493 --> 00:04:30.548
By changing the shape
of a person's red blood cells,

00:04:30.572 --> 00:04:34.865
the sickle cell mutation
confers protection against malaria.

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.521
People with the mutation
aren't less likely to get bitten

00:04:38.545 --> 00:04:41.045
by the mosquitoes
that transmit the disease,

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:44.704
but they are less likely to get sick
or die as a result.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.204
Being a carrier for sickle cell anemia

00:04:48.228 --> 00:04:51.109
is therefore the best
possible genetic option

00:04:51.133 --> 00:04:52.866
in a malarial environment.

00:04:53.276 --> 00:04:55.654
Carriers are less susceptible to malaria,

00:04:55.678 --> 00:04:58.640
because they make some
sickled red blood cells,

00:04:58.664 --> 00:05:01.514
but they make enough
normal red blood cells

00:05:01.538 --> 00:05:05.156
that they aren't negatively affected
by sickle cell anemia.

00:05:07.292 --> 00:05:08.450
Now in my case,

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:12.450
the defective gene I carry
won't protect me against malaria.

00:05:13.196 --> 00:05:16.903
But the unusual prevalence
of the Tay-Sachs mutation

00:05:16.927 --> 00:05:18.799
in Ashkenazi populations

00:05:18.823 --> 00:05:22.755
may be another example
of heterozygote advantage.

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:26.311
In this case, increasing
resistance to tuberculosis.

00:05:27.915 --> 00:05:32.478
The first hint of a possible relationship
between Tay-Sachs and tuberculosis

00:05:32.502 --> 00:05:34.458
came in the 1970s,

00:05:34.482 --> 00:05:35.973
when researchers published data

00:05:35.997 --> 00:05:39.029
showing that among
the Eastern European-born grandparents

00:05:39.053 --> 00:05:43.200
of a sample of American Ashkenazi
children born with Tay-Sachs,

00:05:43.224 --> 00:05:47.018
tuberculosis was an exceedingly
rare cause of death.

00:05:47.042 --> 00:05:51.153
In fact, only one
out of these 306 grandparents

00:05:51.177 --> 00:05:53.019
had died of TB,

00:05:53.043 --> 00:05:56.177
despite the fact
that in the early 20th century,

00:05:56.201 --> 00:06:01.021
TB caused up to 20 percent of deaths
in large Eastern European cities.

00:06:02.483 --> 00:06:05.158
Now on the one hand,
these results weren't surprising.

00:06:05.182 --> 00:06:06.912
People had already recognized

00:06:06.936 --> 00:06:09.403
that while Jews and non-Jews in Europe

00:06:09.427 --> 00:06:13.149
had been equally likely
to contract TB during this time,

00:06:13.173 --> 00:06:16.791
the death rate among non-Jews
was twice as high.

00:06:17.657 --> 00:06:20.831
But the hypothesis
that these Ashkenazi grandparents

00:06:20.855 --> 00:06:23.387
had been less likely to die of TB

00:06:23.411 --> 00:06:28.005
specifically because at least some of them
were Tay-Sachs carriers

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:29.949
was novel and compelling.

00:06:30.545 --> 00:06:31.696
The data hinted

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.886
that the persistence
of the Tay-Sachs mutation

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.616
among Ashkenazi Jews

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.237
might be explained by the benefits
of being a carrier

00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:42.840
in an environment
where tuberculosis was prevalent.

00:06:44.135 --> 00:06:45.491
You'll notice, though,

00:06:45.515 --> 00:06:49.213
that this explanation
only fills in part of the puzzle.

00:06:49.803 --> 00:06:52.983
Even if the Tay-Sachs mutation persisted

00:06:53.007 --> 00:06:55.572
because carriers
were more likely to survive,

00:06:55.596 --> 00:06:58.771
reproduce and pass on
their genetic material,

00:06:58.795 --> 00:07:01.443
why did this resistance
mechanism proliferate

00:07:01.467 --> 00:07:04.534
among the Ashkenazi
population in particular?

00:07:05.626 --> 00:07:10.745
One possibility is that the genes
and health of Eastern European Jews

00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:13.516
were affected not simply by geography

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.905
but also by historical
and cultural factors.

00:07:17.588 --> 00:07:19.302
At various points in history

00:07:19.326 --> 00:07:22.910
this population was forced to live
in crowded urban ghettos

00:07:22.934 --> 00:07:24.334
with poor sanitation.

00:07:24.688 --> 00:07:28.704
Ideal conditions for the tuberculosis
bacterium to thrive.

00:07:29.284 --> 00:07:33.823
In these environments,
where TB posed an especially high threat,

00:07:33.847 --> 00:07:38.649
those individuals who were not carriers
of any genetic protection

00:07:38.673 --> 00:07:41.006
would have been more likely to die.

00:07:41.482 --> 00:07:43.529
This winnowing effect

00:07:43.553 --> 00:07:46.522
together with a strong
cultural predilection

00:07:46.546 --> 00:07:50.879
for marrying and reproducing
only within the Ashkenazi community,

00:07:50.903 --> 00:07:54.625
would have amplified
the relative frequency of carriers,

00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:56.609
boosting TB resistance

00:07:56.633 --> 00:08:01.426
but increasing the incidence of Tay-Sachs
as an unfortunate side effect.

00:08:02.403 --> 00:08:05.154
Studies from the 1980s support this idea.

00:08:05.713 --> 00:08:08.334
The segment of the American
Jewish population

00:08:08.358 --> 00:08:11.498
that had the highest frequency
of Tay-Sachs carriers

00:08:11.522 --> 00:08:13.038
traced their descent

00:08:13.062 --> 00:08:17.098
to those European countries
where the incidence of TB was highest.

00:08:17.678 --> 00:08:21.280
The benefits of being
a Tay-Sachs carrier were highest

00:08:21.304 --> 00:08:25.090
in those places where the risk
of death due to TB was greatest.

00:08:25.561 --> 00:08:28.743
And while it was unclear
in the 1970s or '80s

00:08:28.767 --> 00:08:33.950
how exactly the Tay-Sachs mutation
offered protection against TB,

00:08:33.974 --> 00:08:35.761
recent work has identified

00:08:35.785 --> 00:08:39.816
how the mutation increases
cellular defenses against the bacterium.

00:08:41.315 --> 00:08:44.625
So heterozygote advantage can help explain

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:48.395
why problematic versions of genes
persist at high frequencies

00:08:48.419 --> 00:08:49.952
in certain populations.

00:08:50.482 --> 00:08:53.933
But this is only one of the contributions
evolutionary medicine can make

00:08:53.957 --> 00:08:56.106
in helping us understand human health.

00:08:56.686 --> 00:08:58.051
As I mentioned earlier,

00:08:58.075 --> 00:09:00.003
this field challenges the notion

00:09:00.027 --> 00:09:03.051
that our bodies should have gotten
better over time.

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:06.173
An idea that often stems
from a misconception

00:09:06.197 --> 00:09:08.347
of how evolution works.

00:09:09.363 --> 00:09:10.537
In a nutshell,

00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:13.228
there are three basic reasons
why human bodies,

00:09:13.252 --> 00:09:15.236
including yours and mine,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.942
remain vulnerable to diseases
and other health problems today.

00:09:19.379 --> 00:09:21.561
Natural selection acts slowly,

00:09:21.585 --> 00:09:24.291
there are limitations
to the changes it can make

00:09:24.315 --> 00:09:27.450
and it optimizes for reproductive success,

00:09:27.474 --> 00:09:29.109
not health.

00:09:30.641 --> 00:09:33.799
The way the pace of natural selection
affects human health

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:35.537
is probably most obvious

00:09:35.561 --> 00:09:38.934
in people's relationship
with infectious pathogens.

00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:43.287
We're in a constant arms race
with bacteria and viruses.

00:09:43.311 --> 00:09:48.184
Our immune system is continuously evolving
to limit their ability to infect,

00:09:48.208 --> 00:09:52.776
and they are continuously developing ways
to outmaneuver our defenses.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.815
And our species
is at a distinct disadvantage

00:09:55.839 --> 00:09:58.839
due to our long lives
and slow reproduction.

00:09:59.419 --> 00:10:04.011
In the time it takes us
to evolve one mechanism of resistance,

00:10:04.035 --> 00:10:08.138
a pathogenic species
will go through millions of generations,

00:10:08.162 --> 00:10:10.051
giving it ample time to evolve,

00:10:10.075 --> 00:10:12.840
so it can continue
using our bodies as a host.

00:10:14.481 --> 00:10:16.751
Now what does it mean
that there are limitations

00:10:16.775 --> 00:10:19.100
to the changes natural selection can make?

00:10:19.124 --> 00:10:21.965
Again, my examples
of heterozygote advantage

00:10:21.989 --> 00:10:23.856
offer a useful illustration.

00:10:24.506 --> 00:10:27.371
In terms of resisting TB and malaria,

00:10:27.395 --> 00:10:31.989
the physiological effects of the Tay-Sachs
and sickle cell anemia mutations

00:10:32.013 --> 00:10:33.385
are good.

00:10:33.871 --> 00:10:35.434
Taken to their extremes, though,

00:10:35.458 --> 00:10:37.759
they cause significant problems.

00:10:38.339 --> 00:10:41.458
This delicate balance
highlights the constraints

00:10:41.482 --> 00:10:43.456
inherent in the human body,

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.170
and the fact that the evolutionary process

00:10:46.194 --> 00:10:48.932
must work with the materials
already available.

00:10:49.298 --> 00:10:50.583
In many instances,

00:10:50.607 --> 00:10:52.910
a change that improves
survival or reproduction

00:10:52.934 --> 00:10:54.101
in one sense

00:10:54.125 --> 00:10:57.449
may have cascading effects
that carry their own risk.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:01.290
Evolution isn't an engineer
that starts from scratch

00:11:01.314 --> 00:11:04.593
to create optimal solutions
to individual problems.

00:11:05.077 --> 00:11:07.783
Evolution is all about compromise.

00:11:09.188 --> 00:11:10.736
It's also important to remember,

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.069
when considering
our bodies' vulnerabilities,

00:11:13.093 --> 00:11:15.276
that from an evolutionary perspective,

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.839
health isn't the most important currency.

00:11:17.863 --> 00:11:19.568
Reproduction is.

00:11:19.592 --> 00:11:23.727
Success is measured
not by how healthy an individual is,

00:11:23.751 --> 00:11:25.601
or by how long she lives,

00:11:25.625 --> 00:11:29.570
but by how many copies of her genes
she passes to the next generation.

00:11:30.331 --> 00:11:31.833
This explains why a mutation

00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:34.386
like the one that causes
Huntington's disease,

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.085
another degenerative
neurological disorder,

00:11:37.109 --> 00:11:40.338
hasn't been eliminated
by natural selection.

00:11:40.362 --> 00:11:42.125
The mutation's detrimental effects

00:11:42.149 --> 00:11:46.561
usually don't appear until after
the typical age of reproduction,

00:11:46.585 --> 00:11:50.101
when affected individuals
have already passed on their genes.

00:11:50.855 --> 00:11:52.030
As a whole,

00:11:52.054 --> 00:11:55.744
the biomedical community
focuses on proximate explanations

00:11:55.768 --> 00:11:58.529
and uses them to shape
treatment approaches.

00:11:58.942 --> 00:12:01.586
Proximate explanations
for health conditions

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.751
consider the immediate factors:

00:12:03.775 --> 00:12:06.704
What's going on inside
someone's body right now

00:12:06.728 --> 00:12:08.861
that caused a particular problem.

00:12:09.196 --> 00:12:10.934
Nearsightedness, for example,

00:12:10.958 --> 00:12:14.268
is usually the result of changes
to the shape of the eye

00:12:14.292 --> 00:12:17.025
and can be easily corrected with glasses.

00:12:18.061 --> 00:12:21.188
But as with the genetic
conditions I've discussed,

00:12:21.212 --> 00:12:25.267
a proximate explanation
only provides part of the bigger picture.

00:12:25.776 --> 00:12:28.323
Adopting an evolutionary perspective

00:12:28.347 --> 00:12:32.608
to consider the broader question
of why do we have this problem

00:12:32.632 --> 00:12:34.212
to begin with --

00:12:34.236 --> 00:12:38.340
what evolutionary medicine calls
the ultimate perspective --

00:12:38.364 --> 00:12:41.277
can give us insight
into nonimmediate factors

00:12:41.301 --> 00:12:42.835
that affect our health.

00:12:43.158 --> 00:12:44.309
This is crucial,

00:12:44.333 --> 00:12:48.396
because it can suggest ways
by which you can mitigate your own risk

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.261
or that of friends and family.

00:12:51.571 --> 00:12:53.269
In the case of nearsightedness,

00:12:53.293 --> 00:12:55.039
some research suggests

00:12:55.063 --> 00:12:58.355
that one reason it's becoming
more common in some populations

00:12:58.379 --> 00:13:00.283
is that many people today,

00:13:00.307 --> 00:13:02.529
including most of us in this room,

00:13:02.553 --> 00:13:05.968
spend far more time reading, writing

00:13:05.992 --> 00:13:08.513
and engaging with various types of screen

00:13:08.537 --> 00:13:12.577
than we do outside, interacting
with the world on a bigger scale.

00:13:13.331 --> 00:13:16.664
In evolutionary terms,
this is a recent change.

00:13:17.061 --> 00:13:19.466
For most of human evolutionary history,

00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:22.815
people used their vision
across a broader landscape,

00:13:22.839 --> 00:13:26.259
spending more time in activities
like hunting and gathering.

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:31.418
The increase in recent years
in what's termed "near work,"

00:13:31.442 --> 00:13:34.443
focusing intensely on objects
directly in front of us

00:13:34.467 --> 00:13:36.315
for long periods of time,

00:13:36.339 --> 00:13:38.379
strains our eyes differently

00:13:38.403 --> 00:13:40.926
and affects the physical shape of the eye.

00:13:41.736 --> 00:13:44.077
When we put all these pieces together,

00:13:44.101 --> 00:13:47.403
this ultimate explanation
for nearsightedness --

00:13:47.427 --> 00:13:52.458
that environmental and behavioral change
impact the way we use our eyes --

00:13:52.482 --> 00:13:55.426
helps us better understand
the proximate cause.

00:13:55.736 --> 00:13:58.474
And an inescapable conclusion emerges --

00:13:59.029 --> 00:14:00.363
my mother was right,

00:14:00.387 --> 00:14:04.243
I probably should have spent
a little less time with my nose in a book.

00:14:05.156 --> 00:14:07.705
This is just one
of many possible examples.

00:14:08.047 --> 00:14:12.190
So the next time you or a loved one
are faced with a health challenge,

00:14:12.214 --> 00:14:14.317
whether it's obesity or diabetes,

00:14:14.341 --> 00:14:16.023
an autoimmune disorder,

00:14:16.047 --> 00:14:17.888
or a knee or back injury,

00:14:17.912 --> 00:14:19.157
I encourage you to think

00:14:19.181 --> 00:14:21.974
about what an ultimate
perspective can contribute.

00:14:22.553 --> 00:14:24.847
Understanding that your health

00:14:24.871 --> 00:14:28.919
is affected not just by what's going on
in your body right now,

00:14:28.943 --> 00:14:33.237
but also by your genetic inheritance,
culture and history,

00:14:33.261 --> 00:14:35.895
can help you make more informed decisions

00:14:35.919 --> 00:14:39.255
about predispositions,
risks and treatments.

00:14:40.489 --> 00:14:41.663
As for me,

00:14:41.687 --> 00:14:44.323
I won't claim that an evolutionary
medicine perspective

00:14:44.347 --> 00:14:47.116
has always directly
influenced my decisions,

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.007
such as my choice of spouse.

00:14:49.403 --> 00:14:51.101
It turned out, though,

00:14:51.125 --> 00:14:53.545
that not following
the traditional practice

00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:55.958
of marrying within the Jewish community

00:14:55.982 --> 00:14:58.572
ultimately worked in my favor genetically,

00:14:58.596 --> 00:15:01.993
reducing the odds of me
having a baby with Tay-Sachs.

00:15:02.469 --> 00:15:06.199
It's a great example of why
not every set of Ashkenazi parents

00:15:06.223 --> 00:15:09.362
should hope that their daughter
marries "a nice Jewish boy."

00:15:09.386 --> 00:15:10.386
(Laughter)

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:11.565
(Audience) Woo-hoo!

00:15:11.589 --> 00:15:13.339
More importantly, though,

00:15:13.363 --> 00:15:16.301
the experience of learning
about my own genes

00:15:16.325 --> 00:15:19.920
taught me to think differently
about health in the long run,

00:15:19.944 --> 00:15:23.825
and I hope sharing my story
inspires you to do the same.

00:15:23.849 --> 00:15:25.000
Thank you.

00:15:25.024 --> 00:15:26.500
(Applause)
