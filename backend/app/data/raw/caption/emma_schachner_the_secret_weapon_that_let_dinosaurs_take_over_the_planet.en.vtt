00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:15.444
We've all heard about
how the dinosaurs died.

00:00:16.285 --> 00:00:18.238
The story I'm going to tell you

00:00:18.262 --> 00:00:22.874
happened over 200 million years
before the dinosaurs went extinct.

00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:26.367
This story starts at the very beginning,

00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:28.736
when dinosaurs were just
getting their start.

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.994
One of the biggest mysteries
in evolutionary biology

00:00:32.018 --> 00:00:35.032
is why dinosaurs were so successful.

00:00:35.548 --> 00:00:39.307
What led to their global dominance
for so many years?

00:00:39.896 --> 00:00:43.414
When people think about
why dinosaurs were so amazing,

00:00:43.438 --> 00:00:47.243
they usually think about the biggest
or the smallest dinosaur,

00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:48.712
or who was the fastest,

00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:50.304
or who had the most feathers,

00:00:50.328 --> 00:00:53.234
the most ridiculous armor,
spikes or teeth.

00:00:54.126 --> 00:00:58.110
But perhaps the answer had to do
with their internal anatomy --

00:00:58.134 --> 00:01:00.326
a secret weapon, so to speak.

00:01:00.716 --> 00:01:04.423
My colleagues and I,
we think it was their lungs.

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.403
I am both a paleontologist
and a comparative anatomist,

00:01:09.427 --> 00:01:11.372
and I am interested in understanding

00:01:11.396 --> 00:01:14.805
how the specialized dinosaur lung
helped them take over the planet.

00:01:15.797 --> 00:01:19.498
So we are going to jump back
over 200 million years

00:01:19.522 --> 00:01:21.275
to the Triassic period.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.691
The environment was extremely harsh,

00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:25.355
there were no flowering plants,

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:27.634
so this means that there was no grass.

00:01:27.658 --> 00:01:32.056
So imagine a landscape
filled with all pine trees and ferns.

00:01:32.587 --> 00:01:36.040
At the same time,
there were small lizards,

00:01:36.064 --> 00:01:38.455
mammals, insects,

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.793
and there were also carnivorous
and herbivorous reptiles --

00:01:42.817 --> 00:01:45.104
all competing for the same resources.

00:01:45.454 --> 00:01:46.995
Critical to this story

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:52.347
is that oxygen levels have been estimated
to have been as low as 15 percent,

00:01:52.371 --> 00:01:54.524
compared to today's 21 percent.

00:01:54.932 --> 00:01:58.519
So it would have been crucial
for dinosaurs to be able to breathe

00:01:58.543 --> 00:02:00.418
in this low-oxygen environment,

00:02:00.442 --> 00:02:02.297
not only to survive

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:05.010
but to thrive and to diversify.

00:02:06.462 --> 00:02:09.559
So, how do we know
what dinosaur lungs were even like,

00:02:09.583 --> 00:02:14.716
since all that remains of a dinosaur
generally is its fossilized skeleton?

00:02:15.257 --> 00:02:20.349
The method that we use is called
"extant phylogenetic bracketing."

00:02:21.085 --> 00:02:25.130
This is a fancy way of saying
that we study the anatomy --

00:02:25.154 --> 00:02:28.730
specifically in this case,
the lungs and skeleton --

00:02:28.754 --> 00:02:32.732
of the living descendants of dinosaurs
on the evolutionary tree.

00:02:33.235 --> 00:02:36.199
So we would look at the anatomy of birds,

00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:39.081
who are the direct
descendants of dinosaurs,

00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:41.454
and we'd look at
the anatomy of crocodilians,

00:02:41.478 --> 00:02:43.426
who are their closest living relatives,

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.443
and then we would look at
the anatomy of lizards and turtles,

00:02:46.467 --> 00:02:49.072
who we can think of like their cousins.

00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:52.532
And then we apply these anatomical data
to the fossil record,

00:02:52.556 --> 00:02:56.199
and then we can use that
to reconstruct the lungs of dinosaurs.

00:02:56.223 --> 00:02:58.267
And in this specific instance,

00:02:58.291 --> 00:03:03.205
the skeleton of dinosaurs most closely
resembles that of modern birds.

00:03:03.696 --> 00:03:08.462
So, because dinosaurs were competing with
early mammals during this time period,

00:03:08.486 --> 00:03:12.145
it's important to understand
the basic blueprint of the mammalian lung.

00:03:12.597 --> 00:03:15.431
Also, to reintroduce you
to lungs in general,

00:03:15.455 --> 00:03:18.090
we will use my dog Mila of Troy,

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:20.154
the face that launched a thousand treats,

00:03:20.178 --> 00:03:21.397
as our model.

00:03:21.421 --> 00:03:23.004
(Laughter)

00:03:23.028 --> 00:03:26.764
This story takes place
inside of a chest cavity.

00:03:26.788 --> 00:03:29.985
So I want you to visualize
the ribcage of a dog.

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:32.466
Think about how
the spinal vertebral column

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.759
is completely horizontal to the ground.

00:03:35.783 --> 00:03:38.358
This is how the spinal
vertebral column is going to be

00:03:38.382 --> 00:03:40.788
in all of the animals
that we'll be talking about,

00:03:40.812 --> 00:03:42.310
whether they walked on two legs

00:03:42.334 --> 00:03:43.487
or four legs.

00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:48.025
Now I want you to climb inside
of the imaginary ribcage and look up.

00:03:48.944 --> 00:03:51.019
This is our thoracic ceiling.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.399
This is where the top surface of the lungs
comes into direct contact

00:03:55.423 --> 00:03:57.748
with the ribs and vertebrae.

00:03:58.374 --> 00:04:01.863
This interface is where
our story takes place.

00:04:02.398 --> 00:04:05.433
Now I want you to visualize
the lungs of a dog.

00:04:05.457 --> 00:04:08.645
On the outside, it's like
a giant inflatable bag

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.080
where all parts of the bag
expand during inhalation

00:04:12.104 --> 00:04:14.577
and contract during exhalation.

00:04:14.601 --> 00:04:17.878
Inside of the bag, there's a series
of branching tubes,

00:04:17.902 --> 00:04:20.385
and these tubes are called
the bronchial tree.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:27.014
These tubes deliver the inhaled oxygen
to, ultimately, the alveolus.

00:04:27.038 --> 00:04:32.080
They cross over a thin membrane
into the bloodstream by diffusion.

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:34.750
Now, this part is critical.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.925
The entire mammalian lung is mobile.

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.967
That means it's moving
during the entire respiratory process,

00:04:43.991 --> 00:04:46.577
so that thin membrane,
the blood-gas barrier,

00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:49.636
cannot be too thin or it will break.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.202
Now, remember the blood-gas barrier,
because we will be returning to this.

00:04:53.721 --> 00:04:55.206
So, you're still with me?

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.858
Because we're going to start birds
and it gets crazy,

00:04:57.882 --> 00:04:59.322
so hold on to your butts.

00:04:59.346 --> 00:05:00.951
(Laughter)

00:05:01.648 --> 00:05:04.903
The bird is completely different
from the mammal.

00:05:05.495 --> 00:05:07.888
And we are going to be
using birds as our model

00:05:07.912 --> 00:05:10.343
to reconstruct the lungs of dinosaurs.

00:05:10.367 --> 00:05:11.931
So in the bird,

00:05:11.955 --> 00:05:16.172
air passes through the lung,
but the lung does not expand or contract.

00:05:16.707 --> 00:05:18.648
The lung is immobilized,

00:05:18.672 --> 00:05:20.964
it has the texture of a dense sponge

00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:26.195
and it's inflexible and locked into place
on the top and sides by the ribcage

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:29.313
and on the bottom
by a horizontal membrane.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.386
It is then unidirectionally ventilated

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.398
by a series of flexible,
bag-like structures

00:05:37.422 --> 00:05:40.210
that branch off of the bronchial tree,

00:05:40.234 --> 00:05:41.822
beyond the lung itself,

00:05:41.846 --> 00:05:43.716
and these are called air sacs.

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:49.607
Now, this entire extremely delicate setup
is locked into place

00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:52.820
by a series of forked ribs

00:05:52.844 --> 00:05:55.549
all along the thoracic ceiling.

00:05:55.573 --> 00:05:58.655
Also, in many species of birds,

00:05:58.679 --> 00:06:01.103
extensions arise from the lung

00:06:01.127 --> 00:06:02.673
and the air sacs,

00:06:02.697 --> 00:06:05.305
they invade the skeletal tissues --

00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:08.031
usually the vertebrae,
sometimes the ribs --

00:06:08.055 --> 00:06:11.014
and they lock the respiratory
system into place.

00:06:11.038 --> 00:06:14.474
And this is called
"vertebral pneumaticity."

00:06:14.498 --> 00:06:17.740
The forked ribs and
the vertebral pneumaticity

00:06:17.764 --> 00:06:21.281
are two clues that we can hunt for
in the fossil record,

00:06:21.305 --> 00:06:23.894
because these two skeletal traits

00:06:23.918 --> 00:06:28.637
would indicate that regions
of the respiratory system of dinosaurs

00:06:28.661 --> 00:06:30.335
are immobilized.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.806
This anchoring of the respiratory system

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.737
facilitated the evolution
of the thinning of the blood-gas barrier,

00:06:39.761 --> 00:06:45.860
that thin membrane over which oxygen
was diffusing into the bloodstream.

00:06:46.746 --> 00:06:52.637
The immobility permits this
because a thin barrier is a weak barrier,

00:06:52.661 --> 00:06:57.469
and the weak barrier would rupture
if it was actively being ventilated

00:06:57.493 --> 00:06:59.308
like a mammalian lung.

00:07:00.056 --> 00:07:01.589
So why do we care about this?

00:07:01.613 --> 00:07:03.337
Why does this even matter?

00:07:04.083 --> 00:07:08.338
Oxygen more easily diffuses
across a thin membrane,

00:07:09.536 --> 00:07:15.627
and a thin membrane is one way
of enhancing respiration

00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:17.987
under low-oxygen conditions --

00:07:18.011 --> 00:07:22.592
low-oxygen conditions
like that of the Triassic period.

00:07:23.425 --> 00:07:28.130
So, if dinosaurs did indeed
have this type of lung,

00:07:28.154 --> 00:07:32.211
they'd be better equipped to breathe
than all other animals,

00:07:32.235 --> 00:07:34.369
including mammals.

00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:38.466
So do you remember the extant
phylogenetic bracket method

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.369
where we take the anatomy
of modern animals,

00:07:41.393 --> 00:07:43.928
and we apply that to the fossil record?

00:07:43.952 --> 00:07:48.814
So, clue number one
was the forked ribs of modern birds.

00:07:48.838 --> 00:07:53.249
Well, we find that in pretty much
the majority of dinosaurs.

00:07:53.734 --> 00:07:58.531
So that means that the top surface
of the lungs of dinosaurs

00:07:58.555 --> 00:08:00.869
would be locked into place,

00:08:00.893 --> 00:08:03.845
just like modern birds.

00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:07.406
Clue number two is vertebral pneumaticity.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:12.237
We find this in sauropod dinosaurs
and theropod dinosaurs,

00:08:12.261 --> 00:08:15.536
which is the group that contains
predatory dinosaurs

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.782
and gave rise to modern birds.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:23.589
And while we don't find evidence
of fossilized lung tissue in dinosaurs,

00:08:23.613 --> 00:08:28.162
vertebral pneumaticity gives us evidence
of what the lung was doing

00:08:28.186 --> 00:08:30.638
during the life of these animals.

00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:36.556
Lung tissue or air sac tissue
was invading the vertebrae,

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.087
hollowing them out
just like a modern bird,

00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:43.245
and locking regions
of the respiratory system into place,

00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:44.869
immobilizing them.

00:08:46.138 --> 00:08:47.923
The forked ribs

00:08:47.947 --> 00:08:50.791
and the vertebral pneumaticity together

00:08:50.815 --> 00:08:55.722
were creating an immobilized,
rigid framework

00:08:55.746 --> 00:08:58.688
that locked the respiratory
system into place

00:08:58.712 --> 00:09:04.486
that permitted the evolution of that
superthin, superdelicate blood-gas barrier

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.366
that we see today in modern birds.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.880
Evidence of this straightjacketed
lung in dinosaurs

00:09:10.904 --> 00:09:14.378
means that they had
the capability to evolve a lung

00:09:14.402 --> 00:09:16.140
that would have been able to breathe

00:09:16.164 --> 00:09:21.283
under the hypoxic, or low-oxygen,
atmosphere of the Triassic period.

00:09:21.981 --> 00:09:27.078
This rigid skeletal setup in dinosaurs
would have given them

00:09:27.102 --> 00:09:32.585
a significant adaptive advantage
over other animals, particularly mammals,

00:09:32.609 --> 00:09:35.310
whose flexible lung couldn't have adapted

00:09:35.334 --> 00:09:39.129
to the hypoxic, or low-oxygen,
atmosphere of the Triassic.

00:09:39.664 --> 00:09:44.734
This anatomy may have been
the secret weapon of dinosaurs

00:09:44.758 --> 00:09:47.702
that gave them that advantage
over other animals.

00:09:48.096 --> 00:09:50.900
And this gives us an excellent launchpad

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:55.832
to start testing the hypotheses
of dinosaurian diversification.

00:09:55.856 --> 00:09:59.750
This is the story of
the dinosaurs' beginning,

00:09:59.774 --> 00:10:04.272
and it's just the beginning of the story
of our research into this subject.

00:10:04.932 --> 00:10:06.124
Thank you.

00:10:06.148 --> 00:10:09.109
(Applause)
