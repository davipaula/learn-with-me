00:00:14.926 --> 00:00:18.480
Some superheros can move
faster than the wind.

00:00:18.504 --> 00:00:20.369
The men in Apollo 10 reached

00:00:20.393 --> 00:00:21.612
a record-breaking speed

00:00:21.636 --> 00:00:24.428
of around 25,000 miles per hour

00:00:24.452 --> 00:00:25.738
when the shuttle re-entered

00:00:25.762 --> 00:00:28.281
the Earth's atmosphere in 1969.

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:30.024
Wouldn't we save a lot of time

00:00:30.048 --> 00:00:32.227
to be able to move that fast?

00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:34.897
But what's the catch?

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:36.582
Air is not empty.

00:00:36.606 --> 00:00:38.704
Elements like oxygen and nitrogen,

00:00:38.728 --> 00:00:40.370
even countless dust particles,

00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:42.382
make up the air around us.

00:00:44.812 --> 00:00:47.129
When we move past these things in the air,

00:00:47.153 --> 00:00:48.203
we're rubbing against them

00:00:48.227 --> 00:00:49.871
and creating a lot of friction,

00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:51.433
which results in heat.

00:00:51.457 --> 00:00:53.886
Just like rubbing your hands
together warms them up

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.950
or rubbing two sticks together makes fire,

00:00:55.974 --> 00:00:57.498
the faster objects rub together,

00:00:57.522 --> 00:00:59.797
the more heat is generated.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.271
So, if we're running
at 25,000 miles per hour,

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:08.379
the heat from friction
would burn our faces off.

00:01:09.532 --> 00:01:11.441
Even if we somehow withstood the heat,

00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:12.940
the sand and dirt in the air

00:01:12.964 --> 00:01:14.164
would still scrape us up

00:01:14.188 --> 00:01:15.587
with millions of tiny cuts

00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:17.810
all happening at the same time.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.059
Ever seen the front bumper
or grill of a truck?

00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:24.417
What do you think all the birds
and bugs would do

00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:27.561
to your open eyes or exposed skin?

00:01:31.603 --> 00:01:33.565
Okay, so you'll wear a mask

00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:35.142
to avoid destroying your face.

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.884
But what about people in buildings

00:01:36.908 --> 00:01:39.189
between you and your destination?

00:01:39.213 --> 00:01:41.945
It takes us approximately
one-fifth of a second

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.308
to react to what we see.

00:01:43.332 --> 00:01:45.142
By the time we see what is ahead of us

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:46.105
and react to it -

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:47.689
time times velocity equals distance

00:01:47.713 --> 00:01:48.709
equals one-fifth of a second

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:50.069
times 25,000 miles per hour

00:01:50.093 --> 00:01:51.859
equals 1.4 miles

00:01:51.883 --> 00:01:53.391
- we would have gone past it

00:01:53.415 --> 00:01:56.082
or through it by over a mile.

00:01:56.106 --> 00:01:57.821
We're either going to kill ourselves

00:01:57.845 --> 00:02:00.163
by crashing into the nearest
wall at super speed

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:02.557
or, worse, if we're indestructible,

00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:04.915
we've essentially turned
our bodies into missiles

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.128
that destroy everything in our path.

00:02:08.152 --> 00:02:11.045
So, long distance travel
at 25,000 miles per hour

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.839
would leave us burning up,

00:02:12.863 --> 00:02:13.632
covered in bugs,

00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:16.639
and leaves no time to react.

00:02:16.663 --> 00:02:17.751
What about short bursts

00:02:17.775 --> 00:02:18.862
to a location we can see

00:02:18.886 --> 00:02:20.915
with no obstacles in between?

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.385
Okay, let's say a bullet

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.631
is about to hit a beautiful
damsel in distress.

00:02:26.655 --> 00:02:28.918
So, our hero swoops in at super speed,

00:02:28.942 --> 00:02:29.596
grabs her,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.346
and carries her to safety.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.307
That sounds very romantic,

00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:36.570
but, in reality, that girl
will probably suffer

00:02:36.594 --> 00:02:38.547
more damage from the hero than the bullet

00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:40.457
if he moved her at super speed.

00:02:40.481 --> 00:02:44.531
Newton's First Law of Motion
deals with inertia,

00:02:44.555 --> 00:02:46.278
which is the resistance to a change

00:02:46.302 --> 00:02:48.203
in its state of motion.

00:02:48.227 --> 00:02:49.847
So, an object will continue moving

00:02:49.871 --> 00:02:51.311
or staying at the same place

00:02:51.335 --> 00:02:53.404
unless something changes it.

00:02:53.428 --> 00:02:57.070
Acceleration is the rate
the velocity changes over time.

00:02:57.094 --> 00:02:58.488
When the girl at rest,

00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:00.130
velocity equals zero miles per hour,

00:03:00.154 --> 00:03:02.741
begins accelerating to reach
the speed within seconds,

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:04.042
velocity increases rapidly

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:06.666
to 25,000 miles per hour,

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.677
her brain would crash
into the side of her skull.

00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:11.991
And, when she stops suddenly,

00:03:12.015 --> 00:03:14.892
velocity decreases rapidly
back to zero miles per hour,

00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:17.688
her brain would crash
into the other side of her skull,

00:03:17.712 --> 00:03:21.991
turning her brain into mush.

00:03:22.015 --> 00:03:25.893
The brain is too fragile
to handle the sudden movement.

00:03:25.917 --> 00:03:27.898
So is every part of her
body, for that matter.

00:03:27.922 --> 00:03:30.446
Remember, it's not the speed
that causes the damage

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.798
because the astronauts survived Apollo 10,

00:03:32.822 --> 00:03:34.222
it's the acceleration

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:35.758
or sudden stop

00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:37.363
that causes our internal organs

00:03:37.387 --> 00:03:39.149
to crash into the front of our bodies

00:03:39.173 --> 00:03:40.697
the way we move forward in a bus

00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:42.833
when the driver slams on the brakes.

00:03:43.442 --> 00:03:44.982
What the hero did to the girl

00:03:45.006 --> 00:03:47.497
is mathematically the same
as running her over

00:03:47.521 --> 00:03:50.619
with a space shuttle at maximum speed.

00:03:50.643 --> 00:03:53.748
She probably died instantly
at the point of impact.

00:03:53.772 --> 00:03:56.446
He's going to owe this poor
girl's family an apology

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.995
and a big fat compensation check.

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.270
Oh, and possibly face jail time.

00:04:02.294 --> 00:04:04.247
Doctors have to carry liability insurance

00:04:04.271 --> 00:04:07.065
just in case they make a mistake
and hurt their patients.

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:10.533
I wonder how much superhero
insurance policy would cost.

00:04:11.962 --> 00:04:14.449
Now, which superpower physics lesson

00:04:14.473 --> 00:04:16.947
will you explore next?

00:04:16.971 --> 00:04:21.113
Shifting body size and content,

00:04:21.137 --> 00:04:22.532
super speed,

00:04:22.556 --> 00:04:24.187
flight,

00:04:24.211 --> 00:04:27.137
super strength,

00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:29.670
immortality,

00:04:29.694 --> 00:04:31.575
and

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:34.080
invisibility.
