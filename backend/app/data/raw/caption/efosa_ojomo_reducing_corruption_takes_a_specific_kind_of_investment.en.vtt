00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.533
So in 2011,

00:00:14.557 --> 00:00:16.717
someone broke into my sister's office

00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:19.635
at the university
where she teaches in Nigeria.

00:00:20.277 --> 00:00:24.522
Now thankfully, the person was caught,
arrested and charged to court.

00:00:25.182 --> 00:00:26.863
When I get into court,

00:00:26.887 --> 00:00:30.268
the clerks who were assigned
to my sister's case informed her

00:00:30.292 --> 00:00:32.759
that they wouldn't be able
to process the paperwork

00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:34.429
unless she paid a bribe.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:38.324
Now, at first she thought
it was part of a practical joke.

00:00:38.348 --> 00:00:40.716
But then she realized they were serious.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.629
And then she became furious.

00:00:42.653 --> 00:00:47.741
I mean, think about it: here she was,
the recent victim of a crime,

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:50.737
with the very people
who were supposed to help her,

00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:53.131
and they were demanding a bribe from her.

00:00:53.906 --> 00:00:56.090
That's just one of the many ways

00:00:56.114 --> 00:00:59.532
that corruption impacts
millions of people in my country.

00:01:00.252 --> 00:01:02.049
You know, growing up in Nigeria,

00:01:02.073 --> 00:01:05.646
corruption permeated
virtually every element of the society.

00:01:06.182 --> 00:01:10.701
Reports of politicians embezzling
millions of dollars were common.

00:01:11.463 --> 00:01:14.011
Police officers stealing money

00:01:14.035 --> 00:01:17.573
or extorting money
from everyday hardworking citizens

00:01:17.597 --> 00:01:19.195
was routine practice.

00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:23.950
I felt that development
could never actually happen,

00:01:23.974 --> 00:01:26.261
so long as corruption persisted.

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:28.940
But over the past several years,

00:01:28.964 --> 00:01:32.412
in my research on
innovation and prosperity,

00:01:32.436 --> 00:01:37.149
I've learned that corruption is actually
not the problem hindering our development.

00:01:37.794 --> 00:01:38.945
In fact,

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:42.860
conventional thinking on corruption
and its relationship to development

00:01:42.884 --> 00:01:47.965
is not only wrong, but it's holding
many poor countries backwards.

00:01:48.827 --> 00:01:50.730
So, the thinking goes like this:

00:01:50.754 --> 00:01:53.056
in a society that's poor and corrupt,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.473
our best shot at reducing corruption
is to create good laws,

00:01:57.497 --> 00:01:59.020
enforce them well,

00:01:59.044 --> 00:02:02.940
and this will make way for development
and innovation to flourish.

00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:05.123
Now, it makes sense on paper,

00:02:05.147 --> 00:02:08.319
which is why many governments
and development organizations

00:02:08.343 --> 00:02:11.068
invest billions of dollars annually

00:02:11.092 --> 00:02:14.736
on institutional reform
and anti-corruption programs.

00:02:15.354 --> 00:02:18.571
But many of these programs
fail to reduce corruption,

00:02:18.595 --> 00:02:20.900
because we have the equation backwards.

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:26.221
You see, societies don't develop
because they've reduced corruption.

00:02:26.965 --> 00:02:31.360
They're able to reduce corruption
because they've developed.

00:02:32.034 --> 00:02:35.840
And societies develop
through investments in innovation.

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:39.266
Now, at first, I thought
this was impossible.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.078
Why would anyone in their right mind

00:02:41.102 --> 00:02:44.535
invest in a society where,
at least on the surface,

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:47.070
it seems a terrible place to do business?

00:02:47.094 --> 00:02:50.042
You know, a society where
politicians are corrupt

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:51.656
and consumers are poor?

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.085
But then, the more I learned about

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.536
the relationship
between innovation and corruption,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.879
the more I started
to see things differently.

00:03:01.073 --> 00:03:04.048
Here's how this played out
in sub-Saharan Africa

00:03:04.072 --> 00:03:07.286
as the region developed
its telecommunications industry.

00:03:08.096 --> 00:03:09.509
In the late 1990s,

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:13.676
fewer than five percent of people
in sub-Saharan Africa had phones.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.632
In Nigeria, for example, the country
had more than 110 million people

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:22.060
but fewer than half a million phones
in the whole nation.

00:03:22.084 --> 00:03:26.017
Now, this scarcity fueled
widespread corruption in the industry.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.976
I mean, public officials who worked
for the state-owned phone companies

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.434
demanded bribes from people
who wanted phones.

00:03:32.918 --> 00:03:35.653
And because most people
couldn't afford to pay the bribes,

00:03:35.677 --> 00:03:38.409
phones were only available
to those who were wealthy.

00:03:39.314 --> 00:03:41.668
Then an entrepreneur named Mo Ibrahim

00:03:41.692 --> 00:03:44.986
decided that he would set up
a telecommunications company

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.197
on the continent.

00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:50.903
Now, when he told his colleagues
about his idea, they just laughed at him.

00:03:50.927 --> 00:03:52.736
But Mo Ibrahim was undeterred.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.164
And so in 1998, he set up Celtel.

00:03:57.116 --> 00:04:00.500
The company provided affordable
mobile phones and cell service

00:04:00.524 --> 00:04:02.200
to millions of Africans,

00:04:02.224 --> 00:04:05.815
in some of the poorest and most corrupt
countries in the region --

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:08.665
I mean countries such as Congo, Malawi,

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.448
Sierra Leone and Uganda.

00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:15.847
You see, in our research,
we call what Mo Ibrahim built

00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:18.493
a "market-creating innovation."

00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:24.131
Market-creating innovations transform
complicated and expensive products

00:04:24.155 --> 00:04:26.295
into products that
are simple and affordable,

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:30.093
so that many more people in society
could access them.

00:04:30.775 --> 00:04:32.891
Now in this case, phones were expensive

00:04:32.915 --> 00:04:35.739
before Celtel made them
much more affordable.

00:04:36.855 --> 00:04:39.860
As other investors --
some of his colleagues, actually --

00:04:39.884 --> 00:04:43.673
saw that it was possible to create
a successful mobile phone company

00:04:43.697 --> 00:04:45.012
on the continent,

00:04:45.036 --> 00:04:48.350
they flooded in with billions
of dollars of investments.

00:04:48.374 --> 00:04:51.362
And this led to significant
growth in the industry.

00:04:52.187 --> 00:04:54.593
From barely nothing in 2000,

00:04:54.617 --> 00:04:57.407
today, virtually every
African country now has

00:04:57.431 --> 00:05:00.153
a vibrant mobile
telecommunications industry.

00:05:00.756 --> 00:05:05.222
The sector now supports
close to one billion phone connections,

00:05:05.246 --> 00:05:08.453
it has created nearly four million jobs

00:05:08.477 --> 00:05:12.978
and generates billions of dollars
in taxes every year.

00:05:13.002 --> 00:05:17.136
These are taxes that governments
can now reinvest into the economy

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.285
to build their institutions.

00:05:20.114 --> 00:05:21.632
And here's the thing:

00:05:21.656 --> 00:05:24.792
because most people no longer
have to bribe public officials

00:05:24.816 --> 00:05:26.310
just to get a phone,

00:05:26.334 --> 00:05:30.874
corruption -- at least within
this industry -- has reduced.

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:35.707
Now, if Mo Ibrahim had waited
for corruption to be fixed

00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:39.080
in all of sub-Saharan Africa
before he invested,

00:05:39.104 --> 00:05:40.987
he would still be waiting today.

00:05:41.858 --> 00:05:46.443
You know, most people who engage
in corruption know they shouldn't.

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.482
I mean, the public officials
who were demanding bribes from people

00:05:50.506 --> 00:05:51.657
to get phones

00:05:51.681 --> 00:05:53.736
and the people
who were paying the bribes --

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.551
they knew they were breaking the law.

00:05:55.575 --> 00:05:57.091
But they did it anyways.

00:05:57.638 --> 00:05:59.404
The question is: Why?

00:05:59.967 --> 00:06:01.322
The answer?

00:06:01.346 --> 00:06:02.638
Scarcity.

00:06:04.128 --> 00:06:06.748
See, whenever people would benefit
from gaining access

00:06:06.772 --> 00:06:08.285
to something that scarce,

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:10.666
this makes corruption attractive.

00:06:11.642 --> 00:06:15.668
You know, in poor countries, we complain
a lot about corrupt politicians

00:06:15.692 --> 00:06:17.189
who embezzle state funds.

00:06:17.213 --> 00:06:21.143
But in many of those countries,
economic opportunity is scarce,

00:06:21.167 --> 00:06:24.878
and so corruption becomes
an attractive way to gain wealth.

00:06:25.986 --> 00:06:29.472
We also complain about
civil servants like police officers,

00:06:29.496 --> 00:06:33.027
who extort money from everyday
hardworking citizens.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.691
But most civil servants
are grossly underpaid

00:06:36.715 --> 00:06:38.706
and are leading desperate lives.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:45.201
And so for them, extortion or corruption
is a good way to make a living.

00:06:46.241 --> 00:06:50.435
You know, this phenomenon also plays
itself out in wealthy countries as well.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.517
When rich parents
bribe university officials --

00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:59.196
(Laughter)

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.128
When rich parents
bribe university officials

00:07:02.152 --> 00:07:06.874
so their children can gain admission
into elite colleges,

00:07:06.898 --> 00:07:09.177
the circumstance is different,

00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:10.911
but the principle is the same.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.254
I mean, admission
into elite colleges is scarce,

00:07:14.278 --> 00:07:17.446
and so bribery becomes attractive.

00:07:19.938 --> 00:07:21.116
The thing is,

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.172
I'm not trying to say there shouldn't
be things that are scarce in society

00:07:25.196 --> 00:07:26.736
or things that are selective.

00:07:27.435 --> 00:07:29.110
What I'm just trying to explain

00:07:29.134 --> 00:07:32.891
is this relationship
between corruption and scarcity.

00:07:33.424 --> 00:07:38.324
And in most poor countries,
way too many basic things are scarce.

00:07:38.348 --> 00:07:39.990
I mean things like food,

00:07:40.014 --> 00:07:41.383
education,

00:07:41.407 --> 00:07:42.692
health care,

00:07:42.716 --> 00:07:44.265
economic opportunity,

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:45.517
jobs.

00:07:46.522 --> 00:07:50.677
This creates the perfect breeding ground
for corruption to thrive.

00:07:51.884 --> 00:07:55.088
Now, in no way does this
excuse corrupt behavior.

00:07:55.112 --> 00:07:57.998
It just helps us
understand it a bit better.

00:07:58.672 --> 00:08:02.493
Investing in businesses
that make things affordable

00:08:02.517 --> 00:08:04.999
and accessible to so many more people

00:08:05.023 --> 00:08:06.740
attacks this scarcity

00:08:06.764 --> 00:08:11.297
and creates the revenues for governments
to reinvest in their economies.

00:08:11.992 --> 00:08:15.128
Now, when this happens
on a countrywide level,

00:08:15.152 --> 00:08:17.335
it can revolutionize nations.

00:08:18.284 --> 00:08:20.703
Consider the impact in South Korea.

00:08:21.822 --> 00:08:23.302
Now, in the 1950s,

00:08:23.326 --> 00:08:26.864
South Korea was
a desperately poor country,

00:08:26.888 --> 00:08:28.557
and it was very corrupt.

00:08:29.513 --> 00:08:32.675
The country was ruled
by an authoritarian government

00:08:32.699 --> 00:08:35.496
and engaged in bribery and embezzlement.

00:08:35.858 --> 00:08:41.526
In fact, economists at the time
said South Korea was trapped in poverty,

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:45.153
and they referred to it
as "an economic basket case."

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.430
When you looked
at South Korea's institutions,

00:08:48.454 --> 00:08:50.015
even as late as the 1980s,

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:53.939
they were on par with some of the poorest
and most corrupt African countries

00:08:53.963 --> 00:08:55.210
at the time.

00:08:55.938 --> 00:09:00.669
But as companies like
Samsung, Kia, Hyundai

00:09:00.693 --> 00:09:04.425
invested in innovations
that made things much more affordable

00:09:04.449 --> 00:09:06.633
for so many more people,

00:09:06.657 --> 00:09:09.273
South Korea ultimately became prosperous.

00:09:09.925 --> 00:09:12.682
As the country grew prosperous,

00:09:12.706 --> 00:09:15.784
it was able to transition
from an authoritarian government

00:09:15.808 --> 00:09:18.009
to a democratic government

00:09:18.033 --> 00:09:22.429
and has been able to reinvest
in building its institutions.

00:09:22.453 --> 00:09:24.688
And this has paid off tremendously.

00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:27.660
For instance, in 2018,

00:09:27.684 --> 00:09:31.640
South Korea's president
was sentenced to 25 years in prison

00:09:31.664 --> 00:09:33.643
on corruption-related charges.

00:09:34.259 --> 00:09:38.320
This could never have happened decades ago
when the country was poor

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:41.138
and ruled by an authoritarian government.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:47.095
In fact, as we looked at most prosperous
countries today, what we found was,

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:51.172
they were able to reduce corruption
as they became prosperous --

00:09:51.196 --> 00:09:52.695
not before.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.580
And so where does that leave us?

00:09:56.673 --> 00:10:00.815
I know it may sound like I'm saying
we should just ignore corruption.

00:10:01.259 --> 00:10:03.031
That's not what I'm saying at all.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.370
What I'm suggesting, though,

00:10:05.394 --> 00:10:10.171
is that corruption, especially
for most people in poor countries,

00:10:10.195 --> 00:10:11.490
is a work-around.

00:10:12.196 --> 00:10:13.347
It's a utility

00:10:13.371 --> 00:10:16.946
in a place where there are fewer
better options to solve a problem.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:21.356
Investing in innovations that make
products much more affordable

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.139
for many people

00:10:23.163 --> 00:10:25.376
not only attacks this scarcity

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.117
but it creates a sustainable
source of revenue

00:10:28.141 --> 00:10:31.369
for governments to reinvest
into the economies

00:10:31.393 --> 00:10:33.912
to strengthen their institutions.

00:10:34.497 --> 00:10:38.215
This is the critical missing piece
in the economic development puzzle

00:10:38.239 --> 00:10:41.561
that will ultimately
help us reduce corruption.

00:10:43.013 --> 00:10:45.564
You know, I lost hope
in Nigeria when I was 16.

00:10:46.405 --> 00:10:49.356
And in some ways, the country
has actually gotten worse.

00:10:50.105 --> 00:10:54.280
In addition to widespread poverty
and endemic corruption,

00:10:54.304 --> 00:10:57.189
Nigeria now actually deals
with terrorist organizations

00:10:57.213 --> 00:10:58.915
like Boko Haram.

00:10:59.788 --> 00:11:03.278
But somehow, I am more hopeful
about Nigeria today

00:11:03.302 --> 00:11:05.009
than I have ever been before.

00:11:05.474 --> 00:11:09.336
When I see organizations
investing in innovations

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.671
that are creating jobs for people

00:11:11.695 --> 00:11:13.813
and making things affordable --

00:11:13.837 --> 00:11:16.849
I mean organizations
like Lifestores Pharmacy,

00:11:16.873 --> 00:11:21.253
making drugs and pharmaceuticals
more affordable for people;

00:11:21.277 --> 00:11:23.413
or Metro Africa Xpress,

00:11:23.437 --> 00:11:28.451
tackling the scarcity of distribution
and logistics for many small businesses;

00:11:28.475 --> 00:11:33.602
or Andela, creating economic opportunity
for software developers --

00:11:33.626 --> 00:11:36.372
I am optimistic about the future.

00:11:36.396 --> 00:11:38.125
I hope you will be, too.

00:11:38.149 --> 00:11:39.337
Thank you.

00:11:39.361 --> 00:11:44.285
(Applause)
