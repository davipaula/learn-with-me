Whitney Pennington
Rodgers: Hello everyone,

00:00:14.571 --> 00:00:16.135
and welcome back to TEDConnects.

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:17.438
If you're (Audio feedback)

00:00:17.462 --> 00:00:18.806
joining us for the --

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.760
If you're joining us for the first time,

00:00:20.784 --> 00:00:24.527
we've been bringing interviews all week
with some of the world's greatest minds

00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:28.009
to help us make sense of this
unprecedented moment that we're living in.

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:30.909
I'm Whitney Pennington Rodgers,
TED's current affairs curator

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.276
and one of your hosts.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.458
This week,

00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:36.354
thousands of you have tuned in
to these live events each day,

00:00:36.378 --> 00:00:39.311
and hundreds of thousands more
have watched these interviews

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:40.493
after the fact.

00:00:40.517 --> 00:00:44.406
We've really loved seeing your questions.
They add so much to these conversations.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.762
So please keep them coming.

00:00:45.786 --> 00:00:49.575
In a few minutes, I'm going to disappear
to work with our team behind the scenes

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:51.012
to monitor our Facebook feed,

00:00:51.036 --> 00:00:53.059
where you can leave
some of your questions.

00:00:53.083 --> 00:00:55.360
I'll work to figure out
which ones are the ones

00:00:55.384 --> 00:00:57.243
that we can bring back to our guest,

00:00:57.267 --> 00:01:00.842
and I will ask as many of them
as I can during the live interview.

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:04.389
Today, we're going to be touching
on a subject that I think is top of mind

00:01:04.413 --> 00:01:05.598
for a lot of people,

00:01:05.622 --> 00:01:09.171
so I'd like to turn things over
to the head of TED, Chris Anderson,

00:01:09.195 --> 00:01:11.168
who will introduce today's guest.

00:01:16.335 --> 00:01:17.493
Chris Anderson: Hello.

00:01:17.517 --> 00:01:19.985
WPR: Hi Chris. How's it going today?

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.702
CA: Nice to see you again, Whitney.

00:01:21.726 --> 00:01:24.458
It's going pretty good here. Amazing days.

00:01:25.075 --> 00:01:28.440
WPR: That's good. That's great.
We have sunshine here in the Northeast,

00:01:28.464 --> 00:01:29.726
which is nice.

00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:34.619
CA: So look, I am excited
to introduce this guest,

00:01:34.643 --> 00:01:37.383
because I've known Seth Berkley
for a long time.

00:01:37.407 --> 00:01:39.960
I count him as a friend.

00:01:39.984 --> 00:01:44.350
He's a man who has really devoted his life

00:01:44.374 --> 00:01:48.829
to the most profound questions
about public health.

00:01:49.263 --> 00:01:51.923
Vaccines are extraordinary.

00:01:51.947 --> 00:01:54.967
They save millions of lives.

00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:57.835
The quest for a coronavirus vaccine

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.322
is, I think, the biggest single question
that the world faces now

00:02:02.346 --> 00:02:04.823
if we're going to get out of this.

00:02:04.847 --> 00:02:10.141
So it's just a delight
to welcome Dr. Seth Berkley

00:02:10.165 --> 00:02:12.773
to TED Connects.

00:02:13.405 --> 00:02:14.684
Come on in, Seth.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.757
Seth Berkley: Good
to see you there, Chris,

00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:22.319
and delighted to be with you
and all of the TED community.

00:02:23.981 --> 00:02:26.675
CA: Well, so look, on Tuesday,
Bill Gates was here,

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:29.988
and he mentioned that
your organization, Gavi,

00:02:30.012 --> 00:02:35.255
is really at the heart
of the quest for a vaccine.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.510
So tell us a bit -- what is Gavi?

00:02:41.316 --> 00:02:43.255
SB: So Chris, thank you for that.

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:45.913
What's interesting is that
20 years ago --

00:02:45.937 --> 00:02:48.185
we just celebrated our 20th anniversary --

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.204
there were all these powerful new vaccines
that were being used in wealthy countries,

00:02:53.228 --> 00:02:54.399
and the challenge is,

00:02:54.423 --> 00:02:58.060
they weren't getting to the places
that they could make the most difference:

00:02:58.084 --> 00:02:59.236
the developing world.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.984
So Gavi was formed as an alliance --

00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:07.112
WHO, the World Bank, the Gates Foundation,
UNICEF -- all working together

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:10.661
to try to bring these vaccines
to the developing world.

00:03:10.685 --> 00:03:12.255
And it's been very successful.

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:15.361
We've launched 433 new vaccines

00:03:15.385 --> 00:03:17.538
in the most difficult
countries in the world,

00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:21.610
in the Somalias and Yemens
and DRCs and Nigerias.

00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:27.117
But we've also set up emergency stockpiles
for outbreak-based vaccines,

00:03:27.141 --> 00:03:29.379
so if there's an outbreak
anywhere in the world

00:03:29.403 --> 00:03:34.938
of yellow fever or of things
like cholera or meningitis and now Ebola,

00:03:34.962 --> 00:03:37.992
we have vaccines
that are available to do that.

00:03:38.016 --> 00:03:42.796
And the last thing we are trying to do
is build the health systems out

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.851
to deliver these vaccines,

00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:49.502
but also to make sure that we can
pay attention to new diseases that pop up

00:03:49.526 --> 00:03:51.252
in different parts of the world.

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:54.214
CA: And just give us a sense
of the scale of this.

00:03:54.238 --> 00:03:57.367
How many vaccines
do you distribute in a given year?

00:03:57.391 --> 00:04:00.602
And how many lives do you believe
that that may be saving?

00:04:01.716 --> 00:04:04.155
SB: So, let me give you a macro number.

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:11.169
We've immunized more than
760 million additional children --

00:04:11.193 --> 00:04:13.211
760 million additional children --

00:04:13.235 --> 00:04:15.951
and prevented more than 13 million deaths.

00:04:15.975 --> 00:04:20.460
In an average year, we give
about a half a billion doses

00:04:20.484 --> 00:04:22.928
because we started out with six diseases,

00:04:22.952 --> 00:04:27.320
but now we vaccinate against
18 different diseases.

00:04:28.573 --> 00:04:30.596
CA: Yeah, the scale of that is incredible,

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.129
and amidst all the bad news
that's happening,

00:04:33.153 --> 00:04:39.212
it's kind of amazing that this
intervention can save so many lives.

00:04:39.897 --> 00:04:43.659
I mean, help us understand
what a vaccine is.

00:04:44.992 --> 00:04:47.651
SB: So, the original idea,
the word "vaccine,"

00:04:47.675 --> 00:04:49.825
comes from "vaca," or cow.

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.189
And the observation made in the 1700s

00:04:52.213 --> 00:04:54.660
was that milkmaids had beautiful skin,

00:04:54.684 --> 00:04:59.450
whereas everybody else had pockmarks
from having gotten over smallpox.

00:04:59.474 --> 00:05:03.770
And the concept was that she
was getting infected with a zoonosis,

00:05:03.794 --> 00:05:06.640
that is, with naturally occurring cowpox,

00:05:06.664 --> 00:05:07.941
not smallpox.

00:05:07.965 --> 00:05:10.588
That then protected against smallpox.

00:05:10.612 --> 00:05:15.222
And it was tested in those days:
Could you artificially do that?

00:05:15.246 --> 00:05:17.291
They of course didn't understand virology,

00:05:17.315 --> 00:05:19.525
they didn't understand
any of those issues.

00:05:19.549 --> 00:05:22.428
But what a vaccine
is is something that you give

00:05:22.452 --> 00:05:25.360
to artificially stimulate
the immune system,

00:05:25.384 --> 00:05:27.144
hopefully to not make you sick.

00:05:27.168 --> 00:05:31.592
But then later on, when the body comes
in contact with the real disease,

00:05:31.616 --> 00:05:35.125
it thinks it's already seen it
and it is able to fight it off

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:37.489
without making the person sick.

00:05:38.791 --> 00:05:41.129
CA: I mean, it's kind of
a miraculous thing to me

00:05:41.153 --> 00:05:42.317
that they work that way,

00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:46.642
that your body is always there
looking for these threats.

00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:50.195
And a vaccine, I guess, the body
perceives it as a threat,

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:55.068
and therefore arms itself
against that threat, right?

00:05:55.092 --> 00:05:57.724
And that's what gives the protection.

00:05:57.748 --> 00:06:02.838
So, is that why some people are sort of --
irrationally, I will say --

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:04.866
irrationally scared of vaccines

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.785
and feel that they may be dangerous,

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:10.018
because they are a kind of threat
that you're putting into your body

00:06:10.042 --> 00:06:11.425
in a very subtle way?

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:14.388
SB: Well, of course,
when this first started,

00:06:14.412 --> 00:06:16.217
there were two ways to make vaccines.

00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:19.366
You could grind them up and inject them,

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.544
so-called "whole killed vaccines."

00:06:21.568 --> 00:06:24.636
So you took organisms
and you got an immune response,

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.707
and sometimes those organisms,
even though they were dead,

00:06:27.731 --> 00:06:29.746
gave you a pretty whopping
immune response:

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.059
your arms were sore, you got fevers.

00:06:32.083 --> 00:06:35.895
Then we moved to these
weakened live viruses,

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:37.913
and frankly, those are the best vaccines.

00:06:37.937 --> 00:06:39.096
That's what measles is.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.504
That's what yellow fever is.

00:06:40.528 --> 00:06:42.178
These are weakened viruses.

00:06:42.202 --> 00:06:44.196
They don't give you disease,

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.959
but because they look
like the natural viruses,

00:06:46.983 --> 00:06:51.739
your body gets protection and, frankly,
you get protection for your whole life.

00:06:51.763 --> 00:06:54.253
Today, because people
are worried about side effects,

00:06:54.277 --> 00:06:57.797
we've begun to use molecular biology
and use little bits of it,

00:06:57.821 --> 00:07:01.026
and therefore, it's moved forward.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.331
But the reason people are mostly scared

00:07:03.355 --> 00:07:06.129
is because, frankly, vaccines
have been so successful.

00:07:06.153 --> 00:07:08.713
You don't expect, if you have
a child or two children,

00:07:08.737 --> 00:07:11.360
that those children are going
to die of these diseases,

00:07:11.384 --> 00:07:16.397
unlike in the past, when three or four
out of your five or six or seven kids

00:07:16.421 --> 00:07:17.583
would die.

00:07:17.607 --> 00:07:20.652
So today, people think, well, gee,
these diseases aren't around,

00:07:20.676 --> 00:07:24.301
they're not that bad and, by the way,
if I'm injecting these things,

00:07:24.325 --> 00:07:27.343
maybe they're not organic,
maybe it'll make my child cry,

00:07:27.367 --> 00:07:30.074
maybe it'll make them sick,
and I don't need to do it.

00:07:30.098 --> 00:07:31.329
And that's the challenge.

00:07:31.353 --> 00:07:34.955
You don't want to scare people to death
on how bad these diseases can be,

00:07:34.979 --> 00:07:36.521
but at the same time,

00:07:36.545 --> 00:07:39.393
you want them to understand
that these diseases are serious

00:07:39.417 --> 00:07:43.353
and can cause really bad
disease and sequela.

00:07:44.758 --> 00:07:49.133
CA: So yesterday, you issued
a really powerful call

00:07:49.157 --> 00:07:52.677
for this massive, coordinated
global response

00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:57.275
to tackle the search
for a coronavirus vaccine.

00:07:57.299 --> 00:07:58.933
We're going to come that in a bit,

00:07:58.957 --> 00:08:03.076
because I think
that's a very exciting topic.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.310
But I think we need
some more background first.

00:08:05.334 --> 00:08:08.330
I want to go back five years
to when you stood on the TED stage

00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:13.026
and you held up
two candidate Ebola vaccines.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:17.865
This was just a few months after Ebola
had been terrifying the world.

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:24.290
It was basically amazing how quickly
those vaccines had been developed.

00:08:24.314 --> 00:08:25.815
What happened to them?

00:08:26.961 --> 00:08:28.382
SB: It's a great question,

00:08:28.406 --> 00:08:30.434
and let me tell a little bit of the story,

00:08:30.458 --> 00:08:32.952
but at the end, there were two vaccines.

00:08:32.976 --> 00:08:35.973
One, it turned out,
couldn't finish its testing,

00:08:35.997 --> 00:08:38.352
because the epidemic died down.

00:08:38.376 --> 00:08:40.589
The other one was fully tested.

00:08:40.613 --> 00:08:42.958
It had a hundred percent efficacy.

00:08:42.982 --> 00:08:48.261
We then went on to work with manufacturers
to produce that vaccine,

00:08:48.285 --> 00:08:50.199
at least temporarily,

00:08:50.223 --> 00:08:53.877
in an investigational form,
just in case there were more outbreaks.

00:08:53.901 --> 00:08:56.420
There were, and those
are the vaccine doses

00:08:56.444 --> 00:08:58.590
that we've used in the DRC.

00:08:58.614 --> 00:09:00.527
In the last two outbreaks,

00:09:00.551 --> 00:09:06.326
280,000 people have been vaccinated
with this experimental vaccine,

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.160
and today, there is a licensed vaccine,

00:09:09.184 --> 00:09:16.183
and we are now procuring a global
stockpile of a half a million doses.

00:09:16.998 --> 00:09:19.725
But let me just say, Chris,

00:09:19.749 --> 00:09:26.713
the reason they came so quickly
at that moment is, after September 11th,

00:09:26.737 --> 00:09:30.677
there was concern in the US
about bioterrorism.

00:09:30.701 --> 00:09:32.496
Remember, there were anthrax attacks.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.966
And so what happened was
there was a list of agents,

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.648
and Ebola, for a short time,
was on that list of agents,

00:09:37.672 --> 00:09:39.448
so people started making vaccines,

00:09:39.472 --> 00:09:44.422
and later on, they decided that was
not necessarily a good bioterrorism agent,

00:09:44.446 --> 00:09:46.608
so they dropped that off the list.

00:09:46.632 --> 00:09:50.170
But in the freezers were vaccines
that had been started,

00:09:50.194 --> 00:09:51.409
and they were dusted off,

00:09:51.433 --> 00:09:54.048
and that's why we could move
so quickly in that moment.

00:09:54.412 --> 00:09:57.807
CA: And yet, how long was it
from that moment on the TED stage

00:09:57.831 --> 00:09:59.337
with the candidate vaccine

00:09:59.361 --> 00:10:01.350
to actual deployment?

00:10:02.294 --> 00:10:03.561
SB: So, what happened was,

00:10:03.585 --> 00:10:06.428
the epidemic began to go down.

00:10:06.452 --> 00:10:08.605
The clinical trial
I told you about was done.

00:10:08.629 --> 00:10:11.857
It was a heroic
clinical trial done by WHO,

00:10:11.881 --> 00:10:13.945
and it showed that it had these results.

00:10:13.969 --> 00:10:15.310
That epidemic then stopped.

00:10:15.334 --> 00:10:17.980
We didn't know if there were going
to be more epidemics.

00:10:18.004 --> 00:10:22.566
It took another number of years
to finish the work on the vaccine

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:23.846
to make sure it was pure,

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.016
to figure out how
to manufacture it at scale.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.445
It's during that period
that we put vaccine away

00:10:29.469 --> 00:10:32.103
and had it available in case
there were other outbreaks.

00:10:32.127 --> 00:10:34.293
And it turned out,
there were three outbreaks.

00:10:34.317 --> 00:10:36.359
One went away quickly, but there were two.

00:10:36.383 --> 00:10:38.622
I was there on day 13
of the second outbreak.

00:10:38.646 --> 00:10:42.583
We injected the vaccine, cases went up,
then they went down, and controlled it.

00:10:42.607 --> 00:10:45.436
And then this DRC in North Kivu outbreak,

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.341
which really was terrible
because it was in a war zone.

00:10:48.365 --> 00:10:51.882
And that's the one where we've been
not only vaccinating in DRC

00:10:51.906 --> 00:10:53.555
but in surrounding countries.

00:10:53.579 --> 00:10:59.844
By the way, that is now, I believe,
day 38 or 39 out of the 42 necessary

00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:01.082
to say it's over.

00:11:01.106 --> 00:11:02.268
We hope it is.

00:11:02.292 --> 00:11:05.131
And that would be, again,
an enormous example

00:11:05.155 --> 00:11:08.766
of what vaccines can do,
even in a very difficult setting.

00:11:09.375 --> 00:11:12.098
CA: And yet, in one way, Seth,
it's kind of shocking

00:11:13.141 --> 00:11:19.259
that the outbreak that happened
at the start of 2015, end of 2014,

00:11:19.283 --> 00:11:20.458
that it happened at all,

00:11:20.482 --> 00:11:23.343
because the world has known
about Ebola for a long time.

00:11:23.367 --> 00:11:25.451
It's been sequenced and so forth.

00:11:25.475 --> 00:11:30.155
A vaccine could have been developed
and got ready for a possible outbreak.

00:11:30.179 --> 00:11:32.370
Why didn't that happen?

00:11:33.229 --> 00:11:36.059
SB: Well, there had been
26 outbreaks before,

00:11:36.083 --> 00:11:37.857
but each one of them was small --

00:11:37.881 --> 00:11:40.809
couple of hundred people
or a couple of dozen people --

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:43.214
in the poorest African
countries in the world.

00:11:43.238 --> 00:11:44.788
There was no market for it.

00:11:44.812 --> 00:11:46.425
People didn't know how to test it

00:11:46.449 --> 00:11:48.716
because they would just pop up
and then go away.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.452
And so even though it was obviously
a disease that potentially could spread,

00:11:53.476 --> 00:11:55.128
it had never really spread before.

00:11:55.152 --> 00:11:56.445
Of course, in West Africa,

00:11:56.469 --> 00:11:58.591
they didn't have
a good surveillance system;

00:11:58.615 --> 00:12:02.206
it spread for three months before
people identified that it was Ebola,

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.866
and by that time, it was too late.

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.048
It had spread.

00:12:05.072 --> 00:12:07.650
What's important about that lesson

00:12:07.674 --> 00:12:12.403
is that then caused huge disruption
across Africa, across the world,

00:12:12.427 --> 00:12:14.449
because cases went to other places.

00:12:14.473 --> 00:12:18.854
And the challenge then was,
and the reason we had to step in,

00:12:18.878 --> 00:12:21.270
was because there still was no market.

00:12:21.294 --> 00:12:22.705
So the Gavi board said,

00:12:22.729 --> 00:12:25.877
"We will put out 390 million dollars.

00:12:25.901 --> 00:12:29.090
We'll put it out there and tell companies,
we're open for business,

00:12:29.114 --> 00:12:31.366
we'll create a market,
we'll buy the vaccine."

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:35.904
And that led to companies
being willing to finish the investment

00:12:35.928 --> 00:12:37.526
to get us to where we are today.

00:12:38.275 --> 00:12:39.584
CA: Right, right.

00:12:39.608 --> 00:12:41.068
So it's a real paradox, right?

00:12:41.092 --> 00:12:44.378
In a way, the very thing
that makes vaccines so extraordinary,

00:12:44.402 --> 00:12:49.175
that once they're developed,
they are so cheap to administer,

00:12:49.199 --> 00:12:52.995
for a few dollars, I guess,
you can administer this dose

00:12:53.019 --> 00:12:55.564
that will save someone
maybe a lifetime of illness

00:12:55.588 --> 00:12:56.878
or save their lives,

00:12:56.902 --> 00:13:02.362
and yet so much of medical research
and invention and development

00:13:02.386 --> 00:13:06.627
is done by companies
who need to see a revenue stream,

00:13:06.651 --> 00:13:09.922
and so they don't see it
from those tiny little cheap things

00:13:09.946 --> 00:13:11.685
that might save a lot of lives.

00:13:11.709 --> 00:13:15.528
So it's a real market failure
that in this circumstance now --

00:13:15.552 --> 00:13:18.418
That's one of the things
I guess you're thinking hard about,

00:13:18.442 --> 00:13:21.219
how on earth do we get round
and avoid that market failure

00:13:21.243 --> 00:13:22.974
crippling the response this time?

00:13:23.486 --> 00:13:26.942
SB: Well, first of all, one of the reasons
Bill Gates likes vaccines is,

00:13:26.966 --> 00:13:29.456
in a sense, it's a little bit
like software creation.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.899
You put a lot of money and effort
into creating it,

00:13:31.923 --> 00:13:34.606
but once you've got it,
you can produce it pretty cheaply

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.871
and use it in different places
around the world.

00:13:36.895 --> 00:13:39.542
I don't want to beat up
the pharmaceutical industry here

00:13:39.566 --> 00:13:41.222
because they were heroic in Ebola,

00:13:41.246 --> 00:13:44.539
but I think realistically,
they are for-profit entities,

00:13:44.563 --> 00:13:46.589
and they have to say
to their shareholders,

00:13:46.613 --> 00:13:48.264
"Somebody's going to pay for this,

00:13:48.288 --> 00:13:50.494
or we're going to do it
as a charitable thing."

00:13:50.518 --> 00:13:53.546
And if we do it as a charitable thing,
they can't keep doing it.

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.379
Since then, there is a new initiative

00:13:55.403 --> 00:13:58.760
called CEPI, the Coalition
for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.

00:13:58.784 --> 00:14:01.243
It was set up at Davos a few years ago,

00:14:01.267 --> 00:14:04.092
and its purpose is to try to make vaccines

00:14:04.116 --> 00:14:08.446
for the list of diseases
that aren't yet known epidemics

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.806
but that can potentially be there.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.668
And the idea would be
using public sector money

00:14:13.692 --> 00:14:14.853
to get us prepared.

00:14:14.877 --> 00:14:17.968
Of course, they jumped in
on this coronavirus as well.

00:14:17.992 --> 00:14:19.305
Last thing is, of course,

00:14:19.329 --> 00:14:24.550
I'm not worried on a coronavirus stage
that this is a problem,

00:14:24.574 --> 00:14:25.766
with not having a market.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:29.482
One of the challenges here is that
there may be too big a market for this,

00:14:29.506 --> 00:14:33.399
and therefore, how do we make sure
there's access for developing countries.

00:14:33.423 --> 00:14:35.587
CA: All right, so talk about
this virus, Seth.

00:14:35.611 --> 00:14:38.047
How is it different from Ebola?

00:14:38.071 --> 00:14:39.511
How challenging is it

00:14:39.535 --> 00:14:42.007
to create a vaccine for it?

00:14:43.002 --> 00:14:45.892
SB: So what's interesting
about coronaviruses

00:14:45.916 --> 00:14:47.885
is that they are animal viruses,

00:14:47.909 --> 00:14:49.504
probably primarily in bats.

00:14:49.528 --> 00:14:51.696
They jump into other animals sometimes,

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.242
and then they jump into humans.

00:14:53.266 --> 00:14:55.560
So this shouldn't have been a surprise.

00:14:55.584 --> 00:14:59.736
This is the third coronavirus
that has jumped into humans.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.034
We had SARS in early 2002,

00:15:03.058 --> 00:15:06.327
we had MERS a number of years later,

00:15:06.351 --> 00:15:08.702
and now we have this virus.

00:15:08.726 --> 00:15:10.690
What's interesting is there is a database

00:15:10.714 --> 00:15:16.009
that shows there are 30,000-some-odd
isolated coronaviruses in animals,

00:15:16.033 --> 00:15:18.151
and one of the things
that people tried to do

00:15:18.175 --> 00:15:21.537
was say the way these coronaviruses work
is they have a spike on them.

00:15:21.561 --> 00:15:24.154
They're called "corona"
because they look like the sun.

00:15:24.178 --> 00:15:28.619
That spike is where it attaches
to a certain receptor in people's lungs.

00:15:28.643 --> 00:15:31.963
And so somebody said, well, maybe
we can begin to look at those spikes

00:15:31.987 --> 00:15:34.423
and see if they're similar
to the human receptors

00:15:34.447 --> 00:15:35.708
and they can be predicted.

00:15:35.732 --> 00:15:40.011
But the problem is people don't invest
in those types of research.

00:15:40.035 --> 00:15:42.120
And, of course, I think that,

00:15:42.144 --> 00:15:45.127
given it's an evolutionary certainty,
we're going to see this,

00:15:45.151 --> 00:15:46.306
that we should be.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.012
But one other point about this is

00:15:48.036 --> 00:15:50.891
coronavirus jumped into humans
in ancient history as well,

00:15:50.915 --> 00:15:55.399
and so we have now about a third
to a quarter of the common cold viruses

00:15:55.423 --> 00:15:57.106
are actually coronaviruses.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:00.408
And what's interesting about those
is they don't make you deathly ill

00:16:00.432 --> 00:16:01.600
like these,

00:16:01.624 --> 00:16:04.049
but you also don't have
long-term immunity to them,

00:16:04.073 --> 00:16:06.143
so you can get reinfected
with these viruses

00:16:06.167 --> 00:16:09.455
after 10 months, a year.

00:16:09.479 --> 00:16:12.690
And so that does raise
an issue on vaccinology,

00:16:12.714 --> 00:16:15.823
because you want to ideally
have lifetime immunity.

00:16:16.426 --> 00:16:20.487
CA: The reason why we get reinfected
is because the virus mutates slightly,

00:16:20.511 --> 00:16:22.587
and so it escapes the antibodies?

00:16:22.611 --> 00:16:24.801
SB: No, no, not in this case.

00:16:24.825 --> 00:16:26.324
Not in this case.

00:16:26.348 --> 00:16:29.624
So in flu, that's what happens.
The viruses are always mutating.

00:16:29.648 --> 00:16:33.299
In HIV, the reason we don't have a vaccine
is because they're all mutating.

00:16:33.323 --> 00:16:38.289
In this case, the immune response
seems to get weaker and go away,

00:16:38.313 --> 00:16:40.640
and people get reinfected
with the same viruses.

00:16:40.664 --> 00:16:44.663
Now, that is potentially
a solvable problem using vaccinology

00:16:44.687 --> 00:16:46.590
and many different techniques,

00:16:46.614 --> 00:16:48.876
but the point is, we just can't assume.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.567
Some people now
are talking about herd immunity

00:16:51.591 --> 00:16:53.949
as a way to deal with this virus,

00:16:53.973 --> 00:16:57.444
and the idea there is if you could get
enough people infected --

00:16:57.468 --> 00:17:00.661
you know, forget for a moment
that a lot of people are going to die

00:17:00.685 --> 00:17:02.518
and be miserable while that happens --

00:17:02.542 --> 00:17:05.896
but the idea is that you get
a certain level immunity in the community,

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.554
and then the disease will go away.

00:17:07.578 --> 00:17:10.310
Well, that is only true
if you get long-term immunity.

00:17:10.334 --> 00:17:13.936
If you don't, then you could go
through all of that horrible experience,

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.205
have all those deaths,

00:17:15.229 --> 00:17:18.986
and then not have the protection you need
to protect against this disease.

00:17:19.771 --> 00:17:22.330
CA: OK, so in a way,
the quest we're looking for

00:17:22.354 --> 00:17:26.318
is a vaccine that will work
for the long term.

00:17:26.342 --> 00:17:30.552
I mean, I guess any vaccine
that works at all will be a huge gift,

00:17:30.576 --> 00:17:33.918
but it could well be one
that we have to retake every year,

00:17:33.942 --> 00:17:35.283
or something like that.

00:17:35.307 --> 00:17:37.144
SB: Right. That is certainly possible.

00:17:37.168 --> 00:17:39.068
Of course, we have to remember, though,

00:17:39.092 --> 00:17:43.843
that SARS and MERS both had even higher
mortality than this virus does,

00:17:43.867 --> 00:17:46.503
and they give a much
more profound immune response.

00:17:46.527 --> 00:17:51.491
So it may be that they react differently
than the common cold viruses.

00:17:51.515 --> 00:17:54.757
The challenge, of course, is that
we haven't had the opportunity

00:17:54.781 --> 00:17:56.367
to study these over a long time,

00:17:56.391 --> 00:17:59.328
and this new disease --
three and a half months, we've had it.

00:17:59.352 --> 00:18:01.563
More science has been done
for this disease

00:18:01.587 --> 00:18:03.112
in this short period of time,

00:18:03.136 --> 00:18:06.296
but we don't understand fully
the epidemiology of the virus,

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.309
the immune response, what's protective,
which is the best animal model.

00:18:10.333 --> 00:18:16.086
All of that is being worked on by science
and at breakneck pace,

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.274
but a lot to learn.

00:18:18.298 --> 00:18:24.567
CA: So talk about how the medical
and the research community responded.

00:18:24.591 --> 00:18:28.701
Because, the Chinese authorities --
I guess we heard it yesterday --

00:18:28.725 --> 00:18:32.037
only found out about this
sometime in December.

00:18:32.061 --> 00:18:34.722
Already, early in January --

00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:38.664
I think the virus started in November,
they found out about it in December --

00:18:38.688 --> 00:18:42.997
by early January, they had already
released a sequence of the virus

00:18:43.021 --> 00:18:44.209
to the world,

00:18:44.233 --> 00:18:45.484
and now here we are.

00:18:45.508 --> 00:18:48.162
And I think I saw that
more than 40 companies

00:18:48.186 --> 00:18:51.836
are already claiming candidate vaccines.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.416
What does it mean to have
a candidate vaccine?

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.186
Like, have companies tested this
already against animals or something?

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:01.045
Or are they just looking
at a computer model where they go,

00:19:01.069 --> 00:19:02.426
"That should work"?

00:19:03.266 --> 00:19:05.878
SB: Well, it's an interesting
question you ask there.

00:19:05.902 --> 00:19:07.958
So first of all, China was heroic on this.

00:19:07.982 --> 00:19:11.466
They did post the genetic sequence of it.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:15.030
Today, we have companies
that can sit down with a computer

00:19:15.054 --> 00:19:19.088
and from that genetic sequence,
make what is a candidate vaccine.

00:19:19.112 --> 00:19:22.632
Now, a candidate vaccine obviously means
it's not a licensed product.

00:19:22.656 --> 00:19:24.880
It's something that somebody
wants to work on.

00:19:24.904 --> 00:19:27.694
But you're right, you have to have
the right nomenclature,

00:19:27.718 --> 00:19:31.591
because "candidate" can mean
I'm working on something, it's in my head,

00:19:31.615 --> 00:19:34.922
I'm just doing a little work on it,
I've got something in a vial,

00:19:34.946 --> 00:19:36.997
I'm beginning to do testing on it.

00:19:37.021 --> 00:19:41.284
And so what we saw in that case
was a company called Moderna.

00:19:41.308 --> 00:19:44.023
That was the first vaccine
that went into humans.

00:19:44.047 --> 00:19:46.228
It's a messenger RNA-based system.

00:19:46.252 --> 00:19:49.753
I actually visited the company,
not in this outbreak but before,

00:19:49.777 --> 00:19:51.768
because the technology is interesting.

00:19:51.792 --> 00:19:54.567
And what they were able
to do was, in 42 days,

00:19:54.591 --> 00:19:57.451
make a candidate vaccine
from the genetic sequence.

00:19:57.475 --> 00:19:59.039
They didn't need the organism.

00:19:59.063 --> 00:20:00.897
That now is in clinical testing.

00:20:00.921 --> 00:20:06.550
Now, there is no licensed mRNA vaccine,
so we're going to have to figure out,

00:20:06.574 --> 00:20:07.725
is it safe?

00:20:07.749 --> 00:20:11.072
Does it work in different age groups?
How are we going to scale it up?

00:20:11.096 --> 00:20:12.254
All of that.

00:20:12.278 --> 00:20:15.540
But there are many others who are using
conventional vaccinology.

00:20:15.564 --> 00:20:20.005
An example would be, the French
are working on a measles-based vaccine.

00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:24.203
The idea is to put the spiked protein
in the measles vector,

00:20:24.227 --> 00:20:26.757
and it takes a little bit longer
to do that work,

00:20:26.781 --> 00:20:31.247
but once you have that done, of course,
we know how to make measles vaccine.

00:20:31.271 --> 00:20:35.817
We make hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of millions of doses

00:20:35.841 --> 00:20:37.503
and provide it to the whole world.

00:20:37.527 --> 00:20:41.223
If that was to work,
that might be easier to scale up.

00:20:41.247 --> 00:20:46.129
So I think what we want in the race
is to have multiple different vaccines

00:20:46.153 --> 00:20:47.341
moving forward.

00:20:47.365 --> 00:20:49.204
We don't want one or two.

00:20:49.228 --> 00:20:51.624
We don't want a hundred
in the late stages,

00:20:51.648 --> 00:20:53.472
because it's expensive and hard to do.

00:20:53.496 --> 00:20:57.408
But we want to have a diversity
of science approaches going forward.

00:20:58.162 --> 00:21:01.540
CA: Which of the other candidates
out there are you excited by

00:21:01.564 --> 00:21:02.870
or at least intrigued by?

00:21:03.589 --> 00:21:04.822
SB: Well, for me,

00:21:04.846 --> 00:21:09.552
the critical issue here is going to be
we have to optimize for speed,

00:21:09.576 --> 00:21:11.144
and so that means, as I said,

00:21:11.168 --> 00:21:14.288
having examples of all
the different new technologies

00:21:14.312 --> 00:21:15.841
that could potentially work,

00:21:15.865 --> 00:21:19.727
as well as conventional doses
moving forward at the same time.

00:21:19.751 --> 00:21:23.135
So what you're going to want to do
is have this bubble up.

00:21:23.159 --> 00:21:26.028
And it's not just companies,
or big companies.

00:21:26.052 --> 00:21:27.609
It's also biotech companies.

00:21:27.633 --> 00:21:30.498
It's also academic researchers
that are working on this.

00:21:30.522 --> 00:21:32.227
You want all of those to bubble up.

00:21:32.251 --> 00:21:36.821
Then you want to be able to look at
what's the most promising,

00:21:36.845 --> 00:21:39.624
and that will depend upon animal results.

00:21:39.648 --> 00:21:42.234
It'll depend upon being able
to produce those vaccines,

00:21:42.258 --> 00:21:43.536
have a pathway,

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.442
and eventually, you will want to put those
into human clinical trials.

00:21:47.466 --> 00:21:50.046
That requires a certain amount
of safety work.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:51.790
You can try to accelerate that.

00:21:51.814 --> 00:21:53.810
But then you need to say, OK,

00:21:53.834 --> 00:21:57.607
we need to know, do we need one dose,
do we need multiple doses,

00:21:57.631 --> 00:22:01.161
do we need 50 micrograms, 100, 150?

00:22:01.185 --> 00:22:03.976
Do we need a chemical stimulant
we call an adjuvant?

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.642
Given that this disease,

00:22:05.666 --> 00:22:10.981
its big problems in outcomes
are in the elderly,

00:22:11.005 --> 00:22:15.425
we might need to put some stimulants in
to make it a more potent immune response.

00:22:15.449 --> 00:22:18.807
So all of that work has to go on.
That's what the clinical testing is.

00:22:18.831 --> 00:22:22.196
Eventually you say, "Aha!
Here's the vaccine we're going to use."

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.745
Now you test it in an efficacy trial.

00:22:24.769 --> 00:22:26.631
And that is to see, does it work?

00:22:26.655 --> 00:22:28.861
And at that point,

00:22:28.885 --> 00:22:30.961
you then have a vaccine
that you know works.

00:22:30.985 --> 00:22:32.755
But there is a stage after that,

00:22:32.779 --> 00:22:37.240
and that stage is, you've got
to work out the manufacturing,

00:22:37.264 --> 00:22:40.078
have it all worked out
so that the regulators know

00:22:40.102 --> 00:22:41.859
that you can really make this,

00:22:41.883 --> 00:22:45.344
and that it's pure,
it doesn't have any problems with it.

00:22:45.368 --> 00:22:48.708
And during that period,
and that's what we did in Ebola,

00:22:48.732 --> 00:22:52.581
we were able to use those vaccines
to help in outbreaks

00:22:52.605 --> 00:22:55.958
under a clinical trial protocol
while monitoring them and learning.

00:22:55.982 --> 00:22:59.133
So there's a lot of steps there,
and it's complicated,

00:22:59.157 --> 00:23:00.884
and I've shortened it a little bit.

00:23:00.908 --> 00:23:04.121
CA: But summarize the steps
that they basically need to go through.

00:23:04.145 --> 00:23:07.188
I heard probably an animal test,

00:23:07.212 --> 00:23:08.363
and then --

00:23:08.387 --> 00:23:10.964
SB: Well, for example, Moderna.

00:23:10.988 --> 00:23:14.467
They went into humans at the same time
they're doing animal testing.

00:23:14.491 --> 00:23:16.345
We don't have a perfect animal model.

00:23:16.369 --> 00:23:20.095
But normally it takes
10 to 15 years to do this,

00:23:20.119 --> 00:23:22.554
and that's the compression
you're trying to do here.

00:23:22.578 --> 00:23:26.709
So the challenge is, we can compress
all those different clinical trials.

00:23:26.733 --> 00:23:30.391
The basic way you think about it is,
preclinical studies, animals,

00:23:30.415 --> 00:23:33.821
understanding it, purity, reproducibility.

00:23:33.845 --> 00:23:36.217
Then you move into human studies.

00:23:36.241 --> 00:23:38.715
You start off with a small number
of healthy people.

00:23:38.739 --> 00:23:41.722
You then work on the dosing,
how much, how often.

00:23:41.746 --> 00:23:44.249
Then you move into people
at risk for the disease --

00:23:44.273 --> 00:23:47.739
that might be in this case the elderly
or people with other conditions --

00:23:47.763 --> 00:23:50.001
and then eventually do an efficacy trial.

00:23:50.025 --> 00:23:52.263
Now, one of the cool new
things we can do today

00:23:52.287 --> 00:23:54.779
is something called
"adaptive trial design."

00:23:54.803 --> 00:23:58.004
So rather than do these sequentially,

00:23:58.028 --> 00:24:00.011
what you can begin to do is enroll people

00:24:00.035 --> 00:24:01.903
and then, as you get the data you need,

00:24:01.927 --> 00:24:05.806
you can just begin to bring in
the next set of groups,

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:08.423
and by doing that,
you can speed it up dramatically.

00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:10.819
CA: When you say enroll people,

00:24:10.843 --> 00:24:13.957
you mean enroll people
who have their eyes wide open.

00:24:13.981 --> 00:24:16.719
They have informed consent.
I think that's the term.

00:24:16.743 --> 00:24:17.953
SB: Absolutely.

00:24:18.496 --> 00:24:21.957
CA: And they're willing to,
I guess, take the risk

00:24:21.981 --> 00:24:26.980
that this isn't a fully tested vaccine
but it may well be efficacious,

00:24:27.004 --> 00:24:31.081
and so that obviously can help a lot.

00:24:31.105 --> 00:24:33.118
That's crucial to this, right?

00:24:33.642 --> 00:24:37.359
SB: Absolutely. They are
the unsung heroes of vaccinology,

00:24:37.383 --> 00:24:40.497
because people go out,
they volunteer to take a substance,

00:24:40.521 --> 00:24:43.722
particularly early on,
that don't know how it's going to react.

00:24:43.746 --> 00:24:46.288
Is it going to make the disease
worse? Make it better?

00:24:46.312 --> 00:24:49.081
Is it going to protect them?
Is it going to make them sick?

00:24:49.105 --> 00:24:51.837
So you try to predict that
if you can with animals,

00:24:51.861 --> 00:24:54.891
but people do do that,
and the informed consent says

00:24:54.915 --> 00:24:58.197
not only you may have
these side effects or these problems,

00:24:58.221 --> 00:25:00.259
but also this vaccine may not work.

00:25:00.283 --> 00:25:03.484
And so it's important
for people to understand that,

00:25:03.508 --> 00:25:06.747
because you don't want people
to go and put themselves at high risk,

00:25:06.771 --> 00:25:09.477
saying, "Oh, gee, I had a vaccine,
and so I'm protected."

00:25:09.501 --> 00:25:12.827
We don't know that until
we get to the efficacy stage of trials.

00:25:12.851 --> 00:25:15.420
CA: But Seth, even putting
together all those dots,

00:25:15.444 --> 00:25:17.946
what I've heard most people say

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.851
is that it is likely to take
at least 18 months

00:25:20.875 --> 00:25:24.171
before the world will have
a vaccine available

00:25:24.195 --> 00:25:26.909
at any kind of scale.

00:25:26.933 --> 00:25:29.278
Is that time line right?

00:25:29.302 --> 00:25:33.737
And can the world remotely afford
18 months on this?

00:25:33.761 --> 00:25:37.190
SB: Well, I think, you know,
I've given you many questions.

00:25:37.214 --> 00:25:39.454
I could raise lots more questions.

00:25:39.478 --> 00:25:41.113
So part of it's going to be luck:

00:25:41.137 --> 00:25:45.645
How easy is this particular
candidate vaccine going to be?

00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:49.058
How lucky will we be in getting
a good immune response?

00:25:49.082 --> 00:25:51.890
Which approaches will work?
Will they be scalable?

00:25:51.914 --> 00:25:54.294
So I think there's lot of questions there.

00:25:54.318 --> 00:25:57.566
The world will do everything
they can to squeeze it down,

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:00.717
but I think that's the time line
we're talking about.

00:26:00.741 --> 00:26:04.027
And remember, it's 10 to 15 years usually.

00:26:04.051 --> 00:26:07.945
In the case of Ebola, we did it
in five years to a licensed product.

00:26:07.969 --> 00:26:11.430
In this case, we are hoping
to squeeze it down dramatically,

00:26:11.454 --> 00:26:14.747
but there are many things
we're going to have to go through,

00:26:14.771 --> 00:26:19.624
and it's really about making sure
that vaccine works and it is safe for use

00:26:19.648 --> 00:26:22.079
in what ultimately
may be billions of people.

00:26:23.148 --> 00:26:24.530
CA: Whitney.

00:26:24.554 --> 00:26:27.277
WPR: Hi. So we have
lots of questions coming in, Seth.

00:26:27.301 --> 00:26:30.144
One of them that's kind of
related to this is, you know,

00:26:30.168 --> 00:26:32.090
a lot of us right now are isolating,

00:26:32.114 --> 00:26:34.746
and we're not building
our exposure to this virus,

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:37.615
so how will that affect us
in the long term?

00:26:37.639 --> 00:26:42.730
Will this make us vulnerable
to the virus until a vaccine is available?

00:26:43.734 --> 00:26:45.438
SB: So that's a great question,

00:26:45.462 --> 00:26:47.761
and, as you know,

00:26:47.785 --> 00:26:50.481
we don't fully understand
the epidemiology of this virus,

00:26:50.505 --> 00:26:53.442
but there is some sense
that there may be asymptomatics.

00:26:53.466 --> 00:26:55.341
Do they get immune protection?

00:26:55.365 --> 00:26:58.922
Are they afterwards
resistant to infection?

00:26:58.946 --> 00:27:01.945
We don't know that, but we do know
that people do get sick,

00:27:01.969 --> 00:27:03.459
including young people,

00:27:03.483 --> 00:27:05.597
and that sickness can be quite severe.

00:27:05.621 --> 00:27:08.631
Obviously, a lot of it is mild,
but some of it is quite severe,

00:27:08.655 --> 00:27:10.809
and then it gets more severe
in the elderly.

00:27:10.833 --> 00:27:13.866
So I wouldn't recommend
that anybody go out

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:17.208
and intentionally try to get
exposed to this virus now.

00:27:17.232 --> 00:27:19.510
The whole idea of having isolation now

00:27:19.534 --> 00:27:22.825
is to try to stop
the chains of transmission,

00:27:22.849 --> 00:27:25.197
protect health workers in hospitals,

00:27:25.221 --> 00:27:28.224
with the idea being that if you
can suppress it enough --

00:27:28.248 --> 00:27:30.200
and Bill talked about this
in his talk --

00:27:30.224 --> 00:27:32.236
and later on have testing available,

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:35.700
you might be able to go back
to somewhat of a normal life

00:27:35.724 --> 00:27:39.163
and then watch for
reintroduction of this virus.

00:27:39.187 --> 00:27:41.732
Of course, at the end of the day,

00:27:41.756 --> 00:27:45.452
we will probably need a vaccine
to be able to completely control that,

00:27:45.476 --> 00:27:47.402
but the experiment is going on,

00:27:47.426 --> 00:27:48.600
in China ...

00:27:48.624 --> 00:27:51.117
Japan has done an amazing job
of controlling this

00:27:51.141 --> 00:27:54.706
with slightly less severe interventions.

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:57.449
We've seen in Korea similar things.

00:27:57.473 --> 00:28:00.677
So the hope would be that
if we take it seriously,

00:28:00.701 --> 00:28:07.009
we actually damp down the exposures
and stop this epidemic now,

00:28:07.033 --> 00:28:10.205
we'll be able to remove
to some form of normalcy.

00:28:10.229 --> 00:28:11.788
And we also may have drugs,

00:28:11.812 --> 00:28:13.887
and drugs will change
the dynamics as well,

00:28:13.911 --> 00:28:17.785
because people will then know that they
are able to get treatment as well.

00:28:18.856 --> 00:28:21.948
WPR: Great. I'll be back later
with other questions I'm seeing.

00:28:21.972 --> 00:28:22.987
SB: Thanks, Whitney.

00:28:22.987 --> 00:28:23.987
CA: Thanks, Whitney.

00:28:23.987 --> 00:28:26.624
Thanks everyone watching.
Keep those questions coming.

00:28:27.104 --> 00:28:30.974
Seth, this time line,
I've been puzzled about this,

00:28:30.998 --> 00:28:33.021
because I get that
there are so many things

00:28:33.045 --> 00:28:35.755
that have to be checked out,

00:28:35.779 --> 00:28:38.182
but I still worry

00:28:38.206 --> 00:28:43.652
that the rules are not
adapting rapidly enough

00:28:43.676 --> 00:28:45.372
for the scale of the emergency.

00:28:45.396 --> 00:28:48.467
I mean, my analogy would be:
you're going about your lives,

00:28:48.491 --> 00:28:51.089
and suddenly there's this emergency,

00:28:51.113 --> 00:28:54.426
you see that there's this enemy force
approaching you from the horizon

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:55.858
and coming your direction.

00:28:55.882 --> 00:29:01.163
You don't, in that circumstance,
spend a week trying to test all your guns

00:29:01.187 --> 00:29:04.543
and make sure they're operating
absolutely safely and in the right way.

00:29:04.567 --> 00:29:09.731
You galvanize and you do take
some additional risk

00:29:09.755 --> 00:29:12.232
for the sake of avoiding the bigger risk.

00:29:12.256 --> 00:29:16.506
Is that thinking prevalent right now?

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:20.817
Are there people trying
to make those kinds of trade-offs?

00:29:20.841 --> 00:29:22.348
How should we think about that?

00:29:22.372 --> 00:29:25.828
Or do you really believe
that the community is galvanizing

00:29:25.852 --> 00:29:28.016
and moving forward
as fast as it humanly can

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:31.342
and appropriately balancing the two risks?

00:29:32.178 --> 00:29:35.848
SB: I think we're seeing heroics
in moving forward here.

00:29:35.872 --> 00:29:39.803
Obviously, you're right, and the reason
we talk about going from 10 to 15 years

00:29:39.827 --> 00:29:41.917
down to something like 18 months

00:29:41.941 --> 00:29:45.446
is about squeezing those steps
as much as possible.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:48.659
The regulators in the Ebola experience
were really fabulous.

00:29:48.683 --> 00:29:50.035
They worked with us

00:29:50.059 --> 00:29:55.750
and tried to keep any bureaucratic delays
down to the smallest amount possible.

00:29:55.774 --> 00:29:58.321
And I think that's what's going
to be important here,

00:29:58.345 --> 00:30:00.277
is we have to look at every single step

00:30:00.301 --> 00:30:01.570
and say, "Is it critical?"

00:30:01.594 --> 00:30:04.740
But you do need to answer
a lot of these questions.

00:30:04.764 --> 00:30:08.811
For example, if you have a vaccine
that works in healthy people,

00:30:08.835 --> 00:30:11.675
it very well may not give
an immune response to the elderly.

00:30:11.699 --> 00:30:15.247
We may need to change that vaccine
to make it work there.

00:30:15.271 --> 00:30:17.190
It may not work in young children.

00:30:17.214 --> 00:30:20.658
So you need a certain amount
of studies done.

00:30:20.682 --> 00:30:23.394
Of course, if you work in areas
that have big outbreaks,

00:30:23.418 --> 00:30:26.770
you're able to also enroll more quickly

00:30:26.794 --> 00:30:28.338
and follow people more quickly.

00:30:28.362 --> 00:30:31.482
That's one of the reasons
we'll have to think about this globally,

00:30:31.506 --> 00:30:34.551
because we don't know in 12 to 18 months,

00:30:34.575 --> 00:30:38.179
or even six to 18 months,
if we're really lucky,

00:30:38.203 --> 00:30:42.401
where the epidemic will be raging and
where we want to do the clinical trials.

00:30:42.425 --> 00:30:45.816
We should be prepared to do them
wherever in the world it's possible,

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.613
and also do some
in different types of countries.

00:30:48.637 --> 00:30:51.336
Developing countries may have
different immune responses

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:52.737
than in wealthy countries.

00:30:52.761 --> 00:30:55.063
CA: What alarms me a bit

00:30:55.087 --> 00:30:57.401
is that on the models I've looked at,

00:30:57.425 --> 00:31:02.241
with the possible exception
of what happened in China and Japan,

00:31:02.265 --> 00:31:09.163
by distancing, we can bend the curve,
we can reduce infection.

00:31:09.187 --> 00:31:11.673
But as soon as you go back to normal,

00:31:11.697 --> 00:31:14.747
there's this huge risk
of a massive resurge,

00:31:14.771 --> 00:31:18.887
and until the vaccine comes along,
it feels like your choices are:

00:31:18.911 --> 00:31:23.207
one, sort of recklessly expose
the whole population to the bug

00:31:23.231 --> 00:31:25.491
and develop some kind of herd immunity,

00:31:25.515 --> 00:31:31.719
or try and do this scary dance
of really cramping down on the economy

00:31:31.743 --> 00:31:35.038
and all the risks
that are associated with that,

00:31:35.062 --> 00:31:40.313
and risking, if you lift the lid on that,
risking these really dangerous

00:31:40.337 --> 00:31:42.597
second surges.

00:31:42.621 --> 00:31:45.055
So is that the right way
to think about it?

00:31:45.079 --> 00:31:47.710
There's a scenario where,
until this happens,

00:31:47.734 --> 00:31:48.920
and if it's 18 months,

00:31:48.944 --> 00:31:52.321
that's an incredibly long time
for the world to be

00:31:52.345 --> 00:31:55.502
in that sort of dangerous, scary dance.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.784
SB: Well, I think the issue here is that
is a little bit the way to think of it,

00:32:00.808 --> 00:32:02.523
but the experiment is going on now.

00:32:02.547 --> 00:32:07.503
China is now releasing its controls,
and we will see what happens there.

00:32:07.527 --> 00:32:09.698
We'll see where they have
to clamp back down

00:32:09.722 --> 00:32:11.168
and what's going to happen,

00:32:11.192 --> 00:32:13.404
and we'll get a good idea
of what that's like.

00:32:13.428 --> 00:32:16.843
Right now, in many countries,
we're still in the upscale period

00:32:16.867 --> 00:32:18.458
when we're seeing lots of cases.

00:32:18.482 --> 00:32:20.736
And so we have to break
that transmission first

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.022
before we can have that conversation.

00:32:23.046 --> 00:32:26.993
I'm the first person that would like
a vaccine to occur quicker,

00:32:27.017 --> 00:32:34.013
and, of course, my job
is to underpromise and overdeliver,

00:32:34.037 --> 00:32:35.268
not the other way around.

00:32:35.292 --> 00:32:38.012
And I think we have to be careful
not to think about,

00:32:38.036 --> 00:32:40.673
"Oh, we can just have a vaccine
in a couple of months."

00:32:40.697 --> 00:32:43.534
It may be that we're lucky.
It may be that it's easy to do.

00:32:43.558 --> 00:32:46.119
It may be the first few candidates
will show promise,

00:32:46.143 --> 00:32:49.883
we get efficacy, we can scale those up
for at least some limited use

00:32:49.907 --> 00:32:51.539
while it's being worked out.

00:32:51.563 --> 00:32:54.910
But a lot of things have
to fall in place for that to happen.

00:32:54.934 --> 00:32:57.857
And that's why we want to have
an organized, global effort

00:32:57.881 --> 00:33:02.097
to absolutely incentivize
the best possible chance

00:33:02.121 --> 00:33:04.119
for that to happen in the fastest way.

00:33:04.701 --> 00:33:06.699
CA: There's some kind of debate out there

00:33:06.723 --> 00:33:10.612
about whether there might be
way, way more cases,

00:33:10.636 --> 00:33:15.449
mild cases, basically zero-symptom cases
of coronavirus out there

00:33:15.473 --> 00:33:19.970
that may have granted more people
immunity than we know.

00:33:19.994 --> 00:33:23.304
Is that a credible suggestion?

00:33:23.328 --> 00:33:25.905
More cases and much lower
fatality rate than we know,

00:33:25.929 --> 00:33:28.229
because so many of the cases
could be invisible?

00:33:28.856 --> 00:33:31.945
SB: You know, Mayor Bloomberg
used to have a saying that I loved.

00:33:31.969 --> 00:33:34.726
He said, "In God we trust.
Everybody else, bring data."

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:39.144
And I think the answer here
is we haven't done enough testing to know,

00:33:39.168 --> 00:33:42.292
and we started out with PCR tests
to look for virus,

00:33:42.316 --> 00:33:45.577
and therefore, if you had recovered,
didn't have the virus anymore,

00:33:45.601 --> 00:33:47.052
we weren't able to pick it up.

00:33:47.076 --> 00:33:49.209
Now there are beginning
to be antibody tests

00:33:49.233 --> 00:33:51.255
to look to see if you've been exposed

00:33:51.279 --> 00:33:54.514
and don't have the virus now
but have an immune response to it.

00:33:54.538 --> 00:33:57.575
Once we have those tests
operating at scale,

00:33:57.599 --> 00:34:00.158
we'll be able to understand
what the epidemiology is

00:34:00.182 --> 00:34:01.332
and what's happening,

00:34:01.356 --> 00:34:05.601
and then we'll be in a much better place
to understand how this is playing out.

00:34:05.625 --> 00:34:07.462
Also, I mean, even the question:

00:34:07.486 --> 00:34:09.466
We don't see a lot of
cases in children --

00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:12.794
is that because the children get infected
but they don't get symptoms,

00:34:12.818 --> 00:34:15.146
and therefore they might be
potential spreaders?

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:19.146
Or, is it because those children
don't get it at all?

00:34:20.154 --> 00:34:24.643
CA: So tell us, Seth, about this call
that you issued yesterday.

00:34:24.667 --> 00:34:29.294
I mean, you've said that scientists
are behaving heroically.

00:34:29.318 --> 00:34:32.749
But you've called for something more here

00:34:32.773 --> 00:34:35.835
from both scientists,
companies, governments.

00:34:35.859 --> 00:34:37.663
Tell us what your call is.

00:34:38.483 --> 00:34:41.720
SB: So, first of all, I believe
that, given the situation here,

00:34:41.744 --> 00:34:45.358
this is not the time to just let
the normal system work,

00:34:45.382 --> 00:34:46.694
as we've talked about.

00:34:46.718 --> 00:34:50.206
I think we have to think about vaccines
as a global public good.

00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:54.400
And what that means is that initially,
it ought to be public sector financed.

00:34:54.424 --> 00:34:57.567
Obviously, if others want
to contribute resources,

00:34:57.591 --> 00:34:59.921
I believe they should, fine.

00:34:59.945 --> 00:35:02.447
But we want to make sure
the best approaches come,

00:35:02.471 --> 00:35:05.234
and it doesn't matter
where they come from in the world.

00:35:05.258 --> 00:35:09.717
We want to make sure if the best approach
is in China or Japan or in South Korea

00:35:09.741 --> 00:35:14.218
or in the US, wherever it comes from,
whatever company has the ideas,

00:35:14.242 --> 00:35:15.726
get them on the table.

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:18.480
Then we want a process
to say, realistically,

00:35:18.504 --> 00:35:20.800
how are these being compared?

00:35:20.824 --> 00:35:24.381
How do we decide which ones
are most likely to succeed?

00:35:24.405 --> 00:35:28.142
And then, as I explained,
some diversity in taking those risks.

00:35:28.166 --> 00:35:32.767
Maybe some new technology,
some old technologies to drive forward.

00:35:32.791 --> 00:35:35.849
Once that happens, then,
to try to get clinical trials

00:35:35.873 --> 00:35:37.835
to drive forward as quickly as possible.

00:35:37.859 --> 00:35:42.329
Now, the delay here is actually
likely to be in manufacturing,

00:35:42.353 --> 00:35:46.717
because we might want
billions and billions of doses,

00:35:46.741 --> 00:35:51.990
so how do we then begin to invest,
at risk, in manufacturing plants?

00:35:52.014 --> 00:35:55.264
If it's a big company, they may have
adequate manufacturing,

00:35:55.288 --> 00:35:57.883
but we may want to work
with contract manufacturers,

00:35:57.907 --> 00:36:01.792
other companies, or even build plants
or use new technologies,

00:36:01.816 --> 00:36:03.721
modular technologies to do this.

00:36:03.745 --> 00:36:06.508
And then, of course, at the end
is going to be the process

00:36:06.532 --> 00:36:08.995
of getting the vaccine out
to all those who need it,

00:36:09.019 --> 00:36:12.335
and that's going to need to be
dependent upon the risk at that time.

00:36:12.938 --> 00:36:14.911
CA: Help me understand this better, Seth,

00:36:14.935 --> 00:36:18.094
because right now, it feels like
there's this huge effort going on,

00:36:18.118 --> 00:36:21.607
but companies are operating,
in a way, competitively with each other.

00:36:21.631 --> 00:36:26.431
To an extent, countries are operating
competitively with each other.

00:36:26.455 --> 00:36:31.576
Are you saying that what the world needs
is some kind of widely supported

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.981
global -- I don't know -- vaccine czar

00:36:34.005 --> 00:36:36.522
that is pulling together
different efforts,

00:36:36.546 --> 00:36:41.008
coordinating, encouraging everyone
to work together for the common good,

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:44.640
and trying to get agreement
on these big decisions

00:36:44.664 --> 00:36:48.500
like what are the smart
few candidates to get behind,

00:36:48.524 --> 00:36:51.134
rather than this confusing explosion?

00:36:51.158 --> 00:36:54.541
And then, how do we
coordinate manufacturing, etc?

00:36:54.565 --> 00:36:58.380
Like, is that a person
or a small organization

00:36:58.404 --> 00:37:02.011
that some combination of governments,
WHO, UN needs to put together?

00:37:02.724 --> 00:37:06.134
SB: So, first of all, you want science
to bubble up at the beginning.

00:37:06.158 --> 00:37:09.372
You don't want to have
centralized control,

00:37:09.396 --> 00:37:12.302
somebody saying, "I know best
and I'm going to predict this."

00:37:12.326 --> 00:37:14.761
So you want it bubbling up
from all over the place,

00:37:14.785 --> 00:37:16.647
but then you want a coordinated effort.

00:37:16.671 --> 00:37:20.362
The group that is best-placed to do that
is the World Health Organization,

00:37:20.386 --> 00:37:23.989
maintaining a list of all
the different programs that are going on.

00:37:24.013 --> 00:37:27.303
We also have other organizations.
I mentioned CEPI before.

00:37:27.327 --> 00:37:30.012
CEPI has now supported
eight different candidates.

00:37:30.036 --> 00:37:32.696
I think it's going to support more.

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.857
Right now, WHO has
on its list 44 candidates,

00:37:35.881 --> 00:37:38.438
but some people think
as many as double that.

00:37:38.462 --> 00:37:42.227
So what you want to do is say,
which are the most likely to succeed,

00:37:42.251 --> 00:37:47.638
and then put them through
some type of standardized set of criteria

00:37:47.662 --> 00:37:51.600
to pick a few of them to move forward
aggressively for the world.

00:37:51.624 --> 00:37:53.703
Obviously, science is going
to keep moving,

00:37:53.727 --> 00:37:55.221
they're going to keep changing,

00:37:55.245 --> 00:38:00.067
and it may be that your original approach
isn't right and new ideas may come up,

00:38:00.091 --> 00:38:04.166
but you do need to have some process
of moving this forward.

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:05.972
And really, that's what I called for.

00:38:05.996 --> 00:38:10.507
What we need to make sure is that
if companies have adequate resources

00:38:10.531 --> 00:38:11.811
to do this on their own,

00:38:11.835 --> 00:38:12.992
that's fine,

00:38:13.016 --> 00:38:15.756
but if not, they need to be supported
by the public sector

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:19.973
and, again, making sure there's adequate
manufacturing and ultimately distribution.

00:38:19.997 --> 00:38:22.809
Then, after a period of time,
we can go back to normal

00:38:22.833 --> 00:38:26.999
and return to the normal way
vaccines are handled.

00:38:27.023 --> 00:38:30.659
But I think that's probably
the best way to get there.

00:38:31.463 --> 00:38:34.978
CA: How much might this cost,
and who should pay for it?

00:38:36.375 --> 00:38:38.581
SB: Well, it depends
how many cases there are.

00:38:38.605 --> 00:38:44.741
The good news is, we're talking now about
trillions of dollars in economic loss,

00:38:44.765 --> 00:38:46.057
and this is going to be --

00:38:46.081 --> 00:38:47.993
CA: I would hardly call that good news.

00:38:48.017 --> 00:38:52.106
SB: I mean, I'm making the comparison.
Sorry, you're absolutely right, Chris.

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:55.958
I mean, we're talking about
tens of billions of dollars here,

00:38:55.982 --> 00:38:59.754
not trillions of dollars,
and the reason that's important is

00:38:59.778 --> 00:39:03.990
you want to make sure that any good idea
has its best chance of moving forward,

00:39:04.014 --> 00:39:08.521
and we ought to, again,
optimize for speed

00:39:08.545 --> 00:39:11.580
and not optimize for being
cost-effective at this time.

00:39:12.434 --> 00:39:16.800
CA: So I guess you're saying that, like,

00:39:16.824 --> 00:39:20.378
the rich countries may well be able
to afford some kind of vaccine program.

00:39:20.402 --> 00:39:23.884
I think what I hear you doing here
is representing a lot of the countries

00:39:23.908 --> 00:39:25.072
that can't afford it,

00:39:25.096 --> 00:39:28.071
and what you're saying is that the world
may have to find a way

00:39:28.095 --> 00:39:29.982
of spending tens of billions of dollars

00:39:30.006 --> 00:39:32.385
to avoid trillions of dollars
of economic damage

00:39:32.409 --> 00:39:35.033
and all the hardship that goes
with it around the world.

00:39:35.057 --> 00:39:36.343
Is that about right?

00:39:36.939 --> 00:39:39.958
SB: That's absolutely right,
but I think the important point is,

00:39:39.982 --> 00:39:42.052
this needs to be a global perspective.

00:39:42.076 --> 00:39:44.047
I mean, look at what happened with Ebola.

00:39:44.071 --> 00:39:46.467
We had a vaccine
that was originally made in Canada

00:39:46.491 --> 00:39:48.420
by the Public [Health] Agency of Canada.

00:39:48.444 --> 00:39:52.153
It was then transferred to a US biotech,
then to Merck and Company,

00:39:52.177 --> 00:39:54.577
which is obviously
a global player based in the US,

00:39:54.601 --> 00:39:56.557
and they're manufacturing it in Germany.

00:39:56.581 --> 00:39:58.029
That's the way science works,

00:39:58.053 --> 00:40:01.149
and these vaccines may need
components from other places.

00:40:01.173 --> 00:40:04.898
So how do we think about this
in a global way and make sure that --

00:40:04.922 --> 00:40:07.882
By the way, the second vaccine
that's in humans is from China.

00:40:07.906 --> 00:40:12.204
Of course, they've had a lot of time
to work on it compared to some others.

00:40:12.228 --> 00:40:14.589
And they have a candidate
that's moving forward.

00:40:14.613 --> 00:40:16.179
If that candidate is successful,

00:40:16.203 --> 00:40:18.713
we want to make sure
that's the one that's scaled up.

00:40:18.737 --> 00:40:22.984
And so for me, it's making sure
that we're looking at this

00:40:23.008 --> 00:40:25.110
as a global ecosystem

00:40:25.134 --> 00:40:28.438
with the best candidates moving forward
for the good of the world.

00:40:29.087 --> 00:40:30.267
CA: Whitney.

00:40:30.762 --> 00:40:33.622
WPR: We have a lot of people
watching from all over the world

00:40:33.646 --> 00:40:34.941
and we're seeing questions,

00:40:34.975 --> 00:40:37.900
especially from some of our friends
in India who are watching,

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.828
connected to this just basically about

00:40:39.852 --> 00:40:43.367
how are poor nations
going to get access to this vaccine?

00:40:43.391 --> 00:40:47.247
And then, specifically, when we think
about who gets the vaccine first,

00:40:47.271 --> 00:40:51.939
will there be some sort of payment
that people are paying for this vaccine

00:40:51.963 --> 00:40:55.325
and those who can afford it
will get access before others?

00:40:56.275 --> 00:40:58.391
SB: Well, the decision
on who will pay for it

00:40:58.415 --> 00:41:00.692
will ultimately come
from the political leaders,

00:41:00.716 --> 00:41:04.113
and my recommendation would be,
you start off as a global public good,

00:41:04.137 --> 00:41:07.642
you make the vaccine available
because we're trying to stop the epidemic.

00:41:07.666 --> 00:41:10.403
Later on, we can have tiered pricing
in different places.

00:41:10.427 --> 00:41:12.764
But one of the concerns, of course, is:

00:41:12.788 --> 00:41:15.111
Where is the epidemic
going to be at that point,

00:41:15.135 --> 00:41:16.286
and who needs it first?

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:20.022
I would argue that people that will need
it first are probably health workers,

00:41:20.046 --> 00:41:22.748
because health workers are going
to be on the front lines

00:41:22.772 --> 00:41:25.749
and we want them to be there
to be able to take care of people.

00:41:25.773 --> 00:41:28.773
They're at risk of both contracting it
as well as spreading it.

00:41:28.797 --> 00:41:31.931
Then you probably want to think about
the high-risk individuals,

00:41:31.955 --> 00:41:34.711
the elderly, people who have
preexisting conditions,

00:41:34.735 --> 00:41:38.394
and then eventually, the rest
of the population, if it's needed.

00:41:38.418 --> 00:41:41.392
So having some type of way
of thinking about that.

00:41:41.416 --> 00:41:44.379
We'll also need to be thinking
about equitable access,

00:41:44.403 --> 00:41:47.524
and that is going to mean
thinking about the entire world.

00:41:47.548 --> 00:41:50.416
Now, Gavi, in the past,
including in India,

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:53.564
has worked to make sure
these new technologies are there,

00:41:53.588 --> 00:41:58.289
but these are vaccines that existed
and, in this case, it's a new vaccine.

00:41:58.313 --> 00:42:03.072
We have to make sure that it isn't hoarded
only in wealthy countries

00:42:03.096 --> 00:42:05.005
or in a select set of countries.

00:42:05.029 --> 00:42:09.030
And one way to do that would be to have
vaccine production in multiple places.

00:42:09.054 --> 00:42:13.497
So today a lot of the vaccines
that Gavi uses are made around the world.

00:42:13.521 --> 00:42:15.976
Some are made in
the United States and Europe,

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.860
but some are made in South Korea,
in India, in China, in other countries.

00:42:20.884 --> 00:42:26.098
And so what we could do is have a vaccine
transfer the technology and manufacturing

00:42:26.122 --> 00:42:27.598
in multiple different sites

00:42:27.622 --> 00:42:30.825
so we could have enough vaccine
for that original launch.

00:42:30.849 --> 00:42:34.515
But whatever happens,
there will always be a period of time

00:42:34.539 --> 00:42:38.221
when we'll have an exciting vaccine
and not enough doses to go around,

00:42:38.245 --> 00:42:40.658
and that's when we need
to take hard decisions

00:42:40.682 --> 00:42:43.465
based upon science on who should get it.

00:42:44.615 --> 00:42:48.004
WPR: Thanks for that, Seth.
I'll be back later with other questions.

00:42:48.028 --> 00:42:49.723
CA: Thanks, Whitney. SB: Thank you.

00:42:50.294 --> 00:42:52.958
CA: How confident are you
that we'll eventually get one?

00:42:52.982 --> 00:42:55.871
I mean, we still don't have
a vaccine for HIV,

00:42:55.895 --> 00:42:58.273
nor for the common cold.

00:42:58.297 --> 00:43:01.031
How can you be confident
that we can get one this time?

00:43:01.934 --> 00:43:07.476
SB: Well, first of all, as you know, I did
a TED Talk even before the one of 2015

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:11.797
talking about HIV and flu
and how new science needs to come in,

00:43:11.821 --> 00:43:13.515
and frankly, we are making progress

00:43:13.539 --> 00:43:16.508
against some of these
incredibly difficult organisms.

00:43:16.532 --> 00:43:19.556
You talked about variability.
That's the problem with HIV.

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:22.715
It's constantly changing,
and so you're chasing.

00:43:22.739 --> 00:43:24.419
You get a good immune response,

00:43:24.443 --> 00:43:26.585
but it's to the strain
that was there before,

00:43:26.609 --> 00:43:28.299
and now you're chasing new strains.

00:43:28.323 --> 00:43:30.003
There are ways to work around that.

00:43:30.027 --> 00:43:31.183
It's new science.

00:43:31.207 --> 00:43:33.024
I, actually, I am optimistic.

00:43:33.048 --> 00:43:36.862
I'm optimistic because we have
some experience with SARS vaccines

00:43:36.886 --> 00:43:38.384
and with MERS vaccines,

00:43:38.408 --> 00:43:40.262
and so people have worked on it.

00:43:40.286 --> 00:43:44.500
They've been able to get good immune
responses in animals and in people

00:43:44.524 --> 00:43:45.764
for those vaccines.

00:43:45.788 --> 00:43:48.627
And so we can build on that experience.

00:43:48.651 --> 00:43:51.472
I can't tell you
how long they'll last for,

00:43:51.496 --> 00:43:52.828
how effective they will be.

00:43:52.852 --> 00:43:55.930
Will they need to have
local mucosal immunity,

00:43:55.954 --> 00:43:57.451
which is in the mouth and nose,

00:43:57.475 --> 00:44:00.639
as well as serum immunity
in the bloodstream?

00:44:00.663 --> 00:44:04.701
Will they need to have just antibodies
or the other arm of the immune system,

00:44:04.725 --> 00:44:06.381
the cellular arm?

00:44:06.405 --> 00:44:08.777
These are questions
that will need to be answered,

00:44:08.801 --> 00:44:11.572
but I am a great believer
in the power of science,

00:44:11.596 --> 00:44:16.159
and I think in this case the organism
is not going to be quite as difficult

00:44:16.183 --> 00:44:19.930
as the ones you're talking about
that are much more difficult.

00:44:20.949 --> 00:44:23.666
CA: You mentioned in your TED Talk
five years ago, Seth,

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:27.479
that we've got this situation
where we're spending billions of dollars

00:44:27.503 --> 00:44:30.869
on nuclear submarines
patrolling the oceans

00:44:30.893 --> 00:44:36.128
for a possible incoming threat,
nuclear war threat or whatever,

00:44:36.152 --> 00:44:42.575
and almost nothing on preparation for
a pandemic like the one we're suffering.

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:47.348
If the world is adequately shaken up
by what's happening now

00:44:47.372 --> 00:44:50.283
and gets rational about this,

00:44:50.307 --> 00:44:53.538
what is the key structural shift

00:44:53.562 --> 00:44:57.735
that would be the pandemic equivalent
of having those nuclear submarines?

00:44:57.759 --> 00:45:03.299
How do we prepare for a new virus

00:45:03.323 --> 00:45:05.976
that we don't know what it will be
or when it will come?

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.994
How do we prepare to have
a much more rapid response?

00:45:10.071 --> 00:45:12.980
SB: Well, it's a great question
and I think the TED community

00:45:13.004 --> 00:45:14.162
has a role to play here.

00:45:14.186 --> 00:45:16.307
So first of all, we need
better surveillance.

00:45:16.331 --> 00:45:18.507
We need surveillance
everywhere in the world,

00:45:18.531 --> 00:45:21.029
and that's why we don't want
to have another outbreak

00:45:21.053 --> 00:45:22.549
like in West Africa with Ebola.

00:45:22.573 --> 00:45:25.277
You want to have a resilient health system

00:45:25.301 --> 00:45:27.849
in every country that reaches
out to the periphery.

00:45:27.873 --> 00:45:29.473
And that's an important priority.

00:45:29.497 --> 00:45:31.564
We're doing pretty good with immunization.

00:45:31.588 --> 00:45:34.059
We've reached 90 percent
of the kids of the world

00:45:34.083 --> 00:45:36.095
with at least one dose of routine vaccine.

00:45:36.119 --> 00:45:38.030
That's the best of health interventions.

00:45:38.054 --> 00:45:41.815
But we need to reach that last 10 percent
and put that health system in place.

00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:43.666
Then we need to have a different view.

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:45.201
We need to start working,

00:45:45.225 --> 00:45:47.152
where are our likely hot spots?

00:45:47.176 --> 00:45:50.077
It's where we're cutting down forest.

00:45:50.101 --> 00:45:53.763
It's in urban slums,
where there's density of populations.

00:45:53.787 --> 00:45:55.116
It's with climate change

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:57.136
and movement of different vectors.

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:59.500
And what we need to do
is use predictive science,

00:45:59.524 --> 00:46:01.217
and that's where big data can help,

00:46:01.241 --> 00:46:04.331
that's where AI can help
in terms of trying to do that.

00:46:04.355 --> 00:46:06.583
And we need to have a one-health approach,

00:46:06.607 --> 00:46:09.608
because we tend
to think of animal diseases --

00:46:09.632 --> 00:46:13.129
and by the way, people have worked
on coronavirus vaccines for animals,

00:46:13.153 --> 00:46:15.073
because they also cause disease there --

00:46:15.097 --> 00:46:18.442
we need to make sure that the scientists
working on veterinary vaccines

00:46:18.466 --> 00:46:22.025
are connected to humans, are thinking
about those whole ecosystem.

00:46:22.049 --> 00:46:23.946
And we need to invest in that.

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:29.304
And unfortunately, after an epidemic,
everybody wants to invest,

00:46:29.328 --> 00:46:31.383
and they say, "Whatever it takes,"

00:46:31.407 --> 00:46:36.010
and then we move to on other things,
and investments go down.

00:46:36.034 --> 00:46:40.177
What's different about the military
is that there is a baseline of investment

00:46:40.201 --> 00:46:43.092
that goes on all the time
and nobody questions that.

00:46:43.116 --> 00:46:47.047
It continues, and that level
of preparedness seems to be there.

00:46:47.071 --> 00:46:50.990
Bill Gates in his talk in TED,
when we did that back-to-back, said,

00:46:51.014 --> 00:46:53.046
look, the military are doing war games,

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:56.387
they're constantly testing,
they have all this preparatory activities.

00:46:56.411 --> 00:46:58.708
Why are we not doing that in diseases?

00:46:58.732 --> 00:47:02.272
And, as you know, since then,
there has been some war games,

00:47:02.296 --> 00:47:04.507
and they've basically said
we weren't prepared,

00:47:04.531 --> 00:47:06.605
and I think we're seeing
now that, in fact,

00:47:06.629 --> 00:47:08.425
we're not as prepared as we could be.

00:47:08.449 --> 00:47:13.817
So my hope, the silver lining would be
that we prepare for the next big outbreak,

00:47:13.841 --> 00:47:16.935
because it's absolutely
evolutionarily certain

00:47:16.959 --> 00:47:19.282
we will continue to have outbreaks.

00:47:19.306 --> 00:47:22.015
The question is: How prepared
are we to deal with those?

00:47:23.266 --> 00:47:26.127
CA: As we wait for a vaccine,

00:47:26.151 --> 00:47:29.044
are there other interventions
that could be made,

00:47:29.068 --> 00:47:35.314
for example, the serum from people
who have been infected and have recovered?

00:47:36.293 --> 00:47:39.677
SB: So, that technique has been used
in other infectious diseases

00:47:39.701 --> 00:47:42.867
and throughout history
and even in Ebola recently.

00:47:42.891 --> 00:47:45.289
That's something that could
potentially be done.

00:47:45.313 --> 00:47:50.426
Of course, today, it's more attractive if
you can make antibodies in the laboratory

00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:52.382
and then have those available at scale

00:47:52.406 --> 00:47:53.556
and use those,

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:57.696
and I know of a lot of companies that
are working on producing those antibodies,

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:02.139
which could be infused
in an emergency situation, and do that.

00:48:02.163 --> 00:48:04.806
Obviously, drugs may play
an important role here.

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:07.382
There's a similar effort
to try to create drugs

00:48:07.406 --> 00:48:09.705
that are active against this organism,

00:48:09.729 --> 00:48:13.658
and if we knew that you'd get sick
but there was an effective treatment,

00:48:13.682 --> 00:48:16.701
that would also change
a little bit of the dynamics

00:48:16.725 --> 00:48:19.665
of the fear that exists
around this pandemic.

00:48:19.689 --> 00:48:22.395
So I think there are
lots of interventions.

00:48:22.419 --> 00:48:23.695
Of course, traditionally,

00:48:23.719 --> 00:48:28.339
a preventive vaccine is the best way
to deal with these types of epidemics.

00:48:29.713 --> 00:48:35.152
CA: So paint us -- it's the inner
optimist in me, begging for something --

00:48:35.176 --> 00:48:37.595
paint us the best case scenario, Seth.

00:48:37.619 --> 00:48:39.477
Lots of people are saying,

00:48:39.501 --> 00:48:44.421
we don't want to be huddled in our homes
by ourselves for 18 months,

00:48:44.445 --> 00:48:46.836
lovely though the internet is.

00:48:47.226 --> 00:48:52.470
What's the best case scenario,
putting all the pieces together here?

00:48:53.261 --> 00:48:56.174
SB: Well, I think what is
likely to happen,

00:48:56.198 --> 00:48:59.797
but I don't want to predict,
because we're in unprecedented times here.

00:48:59.821 --> 00:49:04.687
What's likely to happen is that countries
who don't take this seriously

00:49:04.711 --> 00:49:06.457
will have severe outbreaks,

00:49:06.481 --> 00:49:08.312
those that really take it seriously

00:49:08.336 --> 00:49:11.503
and put these extraordinary
mechanisms in place

00:49:11.527 --> 00:49:13.320
will control the disease.

00:49:13.344 --> 00:49:15.174
It'll take some time, it'll take --

00:49:15.198 --> 00:49:19.613
you know, this is weeks, maybe months,
not years, to do that.

00:49:19.637 --> 00:49:23.235
And then you end up with a situation
where the disease is controlled,

00:49:23.259 --> 00:49:27.570
and you then can go back to life as normal
with some cautions around it.

00:49:27.594 --> 00:49:31.199
Now there's beginning to be new tests
that are going to be home tests.

00:49:31.223 --> 00:49:34.743
We're going to be able to figure out
whether classrooms, regions,

00:49:34.767 --> 00:49:36.323
countries have disease.

00:49:36.347 --> 00:49:39.301
We can go back to some level of normalcy,

00:49:39.325 --> 00:49:42.970
but one thing that's really important
is we can't have areas of the world

00:49:42.994 --> 00:49:44.264
with raging disease.

00:49:44.288 --> 00:49:45.859
So for example, if people said,

00:49:45.883 --> 00:49:49.507
"Oh, we're not worried about Africa,
we're only worried about our countries,"

00:49:49.531 --> 00:49:53.090
you might end up in a situation where
you have large numbers of infections,

00:49:53.114 --> 00:49:56.149
the virus is mutating,
it's actually adapting to humans.

00:49:56.173 --> 00:49:58.061
We saw some of that with SARS.

00:49:58.085 --> 00:50:00.990
And then it is easy to reintroduce.

00:50:01.014 --> 00:50:05.124
So what you want to do is dampen it down
everywhere in the world.

00:50:05.148 --> 00:50:08.413
And maybe it'll burn out.
Maybe that'll be it.

00:50:08.437 --> 00:50:10.725
I personally think
we'll probably need a vaccine,

00:50:10.749 --> 00:50:15.825
but best case scenario is that those alone
will stop the epidemic,

00:50:15.849 --> 00:50:19.003
and what we'll need is then a vaccine
just in case it comes back,

00:50:19.027 --> 00:50:21.555
but of course if I was a betting man,

00:50:21.579 --> 00:50:24.265
I'd say let's get a vaccine
as soon as possible,

00:50:24.289 --> 00:50:27.787
because that's the best way
to control a viral infection,

00:50:27.811 --> 00:50:30.100
particularly one
that is spread respiratorily.

00:50:31.068 --> 00:50:33.478
CA: Yeah. It's so interesting
what you said there.

00:50:33.502 --> 00:50:36.304
Like, the vaccine doesn't know
what continent it's on,

00:50:36.328 --> 00:50:38.091
what country it's in.

00:50:38.115 --> 00:50:40.234
It just does its thing.

00:50:40.258 --> 00:50:42.854
SB: That's correct.

00:50:42.878 --> 00:50:45.335
CA: So in terms of people listening here,

00:50:45.359 --> 00:50:48.069
what kind of psychological advice
can you give them?

00:50:48.093 --> 00:50:49.911
What should expectations be?

00:50:49.935 --> 00:50:53.071
Like, do we have to be ready
to settle in for the long haul here,

00:50:53.095 --> 00:50:57.328
or should we be looking forward
to getting back to business

00:50:57.352 --> 00:50:59.985
around about Easter time and celebrating?

00:51:00.818 --> 00:51:04.128
SB: Well, again, I don't want
to put a time line on it like others do.

00:51:04.152 --> 00:51:07.896
What you're going to want to see
is that bending of the curve.

00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:10.361
I think Bill talked about this.

00:51:10.385 --> 00:51:13.413
You want the reproductive rate below one.

00:51:13.437 --> 00:51:15.939
You want to get it
way below one if you can,

00:51:15.963 --> 00:51:18.427
and then to begin
to see the disease spread.

00:51:18.451 --> 00:51:21.121
And what you don't want to do
is, in the middle of that,

00:51:21.145 --> 00:51:22.780
jump out and start having parties.

00:51:22.804 --> 00:51:25.937
It's not time to go on spring break
and start mixing again.

00:51:25.961 --> 00:51:28.546
But with careful control,

00:51:28.570 --> 00:51:32.416
you can begin to release the controls
if that's what science shows us.

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:36.157
And I think the most important thing here
is we need the data to tell us that.

00:51:36.181 --> 00:51:38.133
That's why testing is so important.

00:51:38.157 --> 00:51:40.476
With the wide availability of testing,

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.654
we'll be able to keep tabs,
know what's happening.

00:51:43.678 --> 00:51:46.596
We'll know how many people
are asymptomatic, what's happened.

00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:48.683
We'll know where
there are hot communities,

00:51:48.707 --> 00:51:50.820
and we'll be able to deal with this,

00:51:50.844 --> 00:51:52.000
is my prediction.

00:51:52.024 --> 00:51:55.695
So I don't think this is
over a very, very long time,

00:51:55.719 --> 00:51:59.570
but I wouldn't rush it
during this unprecedented moment.

00:51:59.594 --> 00:52:02.452
Otherwise, we're going to end up
seeing what we saw in Italy.

00:52:02.456 --> 00:52:04.356
What we're seeing in New York right now

00:52:04.356 --> 00:52:06.331
is the overwhelming of the health system.

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:10.632
CA: Yeah, no kidding.
New York is a scary place right now.

00:52:10.656 --> 00:52:12.215
I was out walking today.

00:52:12.239 --> 00:52:13.434
I hope that was OK.

00:52:13.458 --> 00:52:15.580
But there was no one. There was no one.

00:52:15.604 --> 00:52:19.790
Like, you couldn't get within six feet
of someone if you tried right now,

00:52:19.814 --> 00:52:23.042
on the busiest walk spots.

00:52:23.581 --> 00:52:29.078
That was nice to see,
but man, it's startling.

00:52:29.657 --> 00:52:34.498
SB: I mean, recent data has shown
that droplets can spread the disease,

00:52:34.522 --> 00:52:36.938
and so people are rightfully
being cautious.

00:52:36.962 --> 00:52:38.125
And we didn't know that.

00:52:38.149 --> 00:52:41.386
You remember when we started,
we said it's a point outbreak,

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:43.242
out of Wuhan, wet market,

00:52:43.266 --> 00:52:45.486
you had to be in the market
to get the disease.

00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:47.529
Then it was, if you were with sick people,

00:52:47.553 --> 00:52:48.736
you got the disease.

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:50.295
Then it was maybe asymptomatics.

00:52:50.319 --> 00:52:51.889
I think as we understand better,

00:52:51.913 --> 00:52:54.209
that gives us the tools
to do the right thing.

00:52:55.121 --> 00:53:00.000
CA: There's a debate out there that
seems to be growing again about masks.

00:53:00.024 --> 00:53:04.952
The East and West take
very different advice on masks.

00:53:04.976 --> 00:53:09.336
We were hearing from Gary Liu yesterday
that everyone in Hong Kong and China

00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:10.678
is basically wearing masks,

00:53:10.702 --> 00:53:12.700
and arguably, that has been effective.

00:53:12.724 --> 00:53:15.631
The advice in the West
against not wearing masks --

00:53:15.655 --> 00:53:19.574
how much of that has been driven by just
the fact that there's a shortage of masks

00:53:19.598 --> 00:53:23.059
and that if anyone needs to wear them,
it's medical professionals?

00:53:23.083 --> 00:53:30.077
If it's water droplets, it seems like
masks could be effective in prevention.

00:53:30.101 --> 00:53:33.376
SB: I mean, the most important
intervention, as you know,

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:38.313
is some isolation and very careful
handwashing or use of sanitizers,

00:53:38.337 --> 00:53:41.435
because what happens is,
you touch your face --

00:53:41.459 --> 00:53:45.989
I forget the number, I think
it's like every one to two minutes --

00:53:46.013 --> 00:53:47.195
and you touch your eyes,

00:53:47.219 --> 00:53:50.864
so if you reach a door handle
or you have contact with a surface,

00:53:50.888 --> 00:53:53.257
and we know the virus
can live on those surfaces,

00:53:53.281 --> 00:53:54.680
and then you touch your face,

00:53:54.704 --> 00:53:56.637
touch your mouth, touch your nose,

00:53:56.661 --> 00:53:57.814
you can spread it.

00:53:57.838 --> 00:54:00.530
So the purpose of a mask
for a person who is not infected

00:54:00.554 --> 00:54:02.918
is not so much to keep them
from getting infected.

00:54:02.942 --> 00:54:06.146
It is to keep them
from touching their face.

00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:08.844
So I think what's interesting here is,

00:54:08.868 --> 00:54:12.426
how do we get people
to have this personal sanitation?

00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:15.829
If we have unlimited quantities of masks,
people want to do it as a way

00:54:15.853 --> 00:54:19.364
to remind themselves
not to touch their face.

00:54:19.388 --> 00:54:21.574
Now, that's very different
if you're infected,

00:54:21.598 --> 00:54:23.406
because if you're coughing,

00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:28.488
having a mask on does reduce
the spread of droplets,

00:54:28.512 --> 00:54:34.490
and that's why they recommend it
in a situation where somebody is infected

00:54:34.514 --> 00:54:37.977
and has to go to the hospital
or has to go out and be seen.

00:54:38.551 --> 00:54:40.089
CA: Yeah, I was touching my face

00:54:40.113 --> 00:54:42.432
all through the Bill Gates
interview, apparently,

00:54:42.456 --> 00:54:46.160
and I got called to task
by our online friends,

00:54:46.184 --> 00:54:47.341
which was very nice.

00:54:47.365 --> 00:54:49.410
I don't know if I've
been doing that today.

00:54:49.434 --> 00:54:51.790
It's funny, you're unconscious
of it. It's weird.

00:54:51.814 --> 00:54:53.158
SB: Yes. No, it's automatic.

00:54:53.182 --> 00:54:57.687
And in fact, there was a WHO
challenge for safe handwashing,

00:54:57.711 --> 00:55:00.742
and I did a video, and I left
my water running while I did it,

00:55:00.766 --> 00:55:04.029
and my friends in the developing world
came to me and said,

00:55:04.053 --> 00:55:08.651
you know, I live in Switzerland
by a lake where we have a lot of water,

00:55:08.675 --> 00:55:11.567
and I wasn't careful,
and they were absolutely right.

00:55:11.591 --> 00:55:13.628
So it's really good we correct each other,

00:55:13.652 --> 00:55:14.899
that's an important point,

00:55:14.923 --> 00:55:17.066
and help each other in doing this

00:55:17.090 --> 00:55:22.947
to get us to be as compliant
as we possibly can for these issues.

00:55:22.971 --> 00:55:24.144
Whitney.

00:55:24.588 --> 00:55:27.490
WPR: Yep. So feedback online
is overwhelmingly positive.

00:55:27.514 --> 00:55:30.692
You're really answering
all of everyone's questions out there,

00:55:30.716 --> 00:55:33.390
and people really appreciate
what you're sharing, Seth.

00:55:33.414 --> 00:55:36.678
I think one big question is just
for folks who are watching from home

00:55:36.702 --> 00:55:39.568
and maybe who are not part
of your community

00:55:39.592 --> 00:55:41.883
in terms of the science community.

00:55:41.907 --> 00:55:45.010
How can they contribute
to this global response effort?

00:55:45.034 --> 00:55:47.703
How can they do something to advance this?

00:55:48.576 --> 00:55:50.007
SB: That's a great question.

00:55:50.031 --> 00:55:55.072
So first of all, I think it's really
important that citizens support leaders

00:55:55.096 --> 00:55:56.941
who are following science,

00:55:56.965 --> 00:55:58.911
are using science,

00:55:58.935 --> 00:56:02.116
because, as you know,
sometimes political leaders say,

00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:05.385
"Well, I don't want to do this
because it's not good for my image

00:56:05.409 --> 00:56:08.452
or it's not good for the economy
or it's not good for whatever."

00:56:08.476 --> 00:56:11.694
And I think you want to have
all of your decisions taken by science,

00:56:11.718 --> 00:56:13.972
understanding that they're
not the best science.

00:56:13.996 --> 00:56:15.542
So, citizens need to applaud,

00:56:15.566 --> 00:56:18.808
even if it's a tough decision
that politicians take for the good

00:56:18.832 --> 00:56:20.997
based upon science, that's a good thing.

00:56:21.021 --> 00:56:23.136
The second thing
that really would be helpful

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:28.897
is this concept: How do we keep
our world focused on the fact

00:56:28.921 --> 00:56:32.362
that these epidemics will occur?

00:56:32.386 --> 00:56:34.478
Another example I didn't answer,

00:56:34.502 --> 00:56:37.600
which Chris, when he asked me
about what could be done,

00:56:37.624 --> 00:56:40.046
we talked about this idea
of platform technologies.

00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:43.466
These are vaccines that you can test,
get them all ready,

00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:46.397
and then, when a new organism occurs,
you can put it in there

00:56:46.421 --> 00:56:49.081
and you know how to manufacture it,
how to scale it up.

00:56:49.105 --> 00:56:52.246
These types of things can be done.
CEPI is trying to do that now.

00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:53.634
But the challenge is,

00:56:53.658 --> 00:56:55.832
if we, a year after this,

00:56:55.856 --> 00:56:59.418
go down to having no money
available for these types of issues,

00:56:59.442 --> 00:57:00.605
that will be a problem.

00:57:00.629 --> 00:57:02.469
So what you need is citizens to say,

00:57:02.493 --> 00:57:04.023
"I understand now

00:57:04.047 --> 00:57:06.352
that health is precious,

00:57:06.376 --> 00:57:09.258
and I want my government, my leaders

00:57:09.282 --> 00:57:12.468
to invest in this, in the science,

00:57:12.492 --> 00:57:13.650
in the ways of working

00:57:13.674 --> 00:57:16.425
so that we will be as safe
as we can be going forward."

00:57:16.449 --> 00:57:20.147
And I think I can't emphasize enough
how important a message that is

00:57:20.171 --> 00:57:22.090
for citizens everywhere in the world.

00:57:22.767 --> 00:57:23.926
CA: Mmm.

00:57:24.914 --> 00:57:28.697
Hey Whitney, stay on as we wrap up here.

00:57:29.185 --> 00:57:35.300
I guess what I'd like to give you
a chance to do, Seth,

00:57:35.324 --> 00:57:36.673
as we wrap this up

00:57:36.697 --> 00:57:38.111
is just to look at the camera

00:57:38.135 --> 00:57:42.464
and make your call to the world's leaders,

00:57:42.488 --> 00:57:44.218
companies,

00:57:44.242 --> 00:57:48.079
politicians, scientists, citizens.

00:57:48.103 --> 00:57:50.688
How do we move forward?

00:57:50.712 --> 00:57:52.435
How would you wrap this up?

00:57:53.753 --> 00:57:55.522
SB: So from my perspective,

00:57:55.546 --> 00:57:58.494
what we need is the world
to come together at this moment,

00:57:58.518 --> 00:58:01.543
not to talk about our national programs,

00:58:01.567 --> 00:58:03.878
not to talk about
our science are the best,

00:58:03.902 --> 00:58:05.357
and they may be the best,

00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:07.441
but how do we, as a world,

00:58:07.465 --> 00:58:10.641
pool our best science, our best resources,

00:58:10.665 --> 00:58:13.499
our best ways of working,
our best manufacturing,

00:58:13.523 --> 00:58:15.284
our best clinical trials,

00:58:15.308 --> 00:58:17.718
to move this forward as fast as possible?

00:58:17.742 --> 00:58:22.737
The WHO is a global organization
whose job is this normative function,

00:58:22.761 --> 00:58:27.498
and we can get scientists to help them
make sure that the normative function

00:58:27.522 --> 00:58:29.364
is as strong as it can be.

00:58:29.388 --> 00:58:32.111
We can get the leaders
of the world to come together

00:58:32.135 --> 00:58:33.862
and put the resources in place.

00:58:33.886 --> 00:58:35.908
Given the cost it's having on the economy,

00:58:35.932 --> 00:58:38.449
this will be a real bargain
to invest in it.

00:58:38.473 --> 00:58:43.099
But what we need is to have that mindset
of having science drive us

00:58:43.123 --> 00:58:47.473
and to make sure that we have no barriers
in stopping that science going forward.

00:58:47.497 --> 00:58:50.979
That's my request to the world,
and I think we can do it,

00:58:51.003 --> 00:58:53.995
and if we do that, we will end up
seeing the power of science,

00:58:54.019 --> 00:58:56.786
which will give us the tools we need

00:58:56.810 --> 00:59:00.300
to either stop it --
hopefully, it'll be stopped by then --

00:59:00.324 --> 00:59:04.184
but stop it and then prepare us
for the next one.

00:59:04.748 --> 00:59:05.954
CA: Mmm.

00:59:06.666 --> 00:59:07.929
Powerfully said.

00:59:07.953 --> 00:59:10.371
I have to say, Seth,
it's incredibly encouraging

00:59:10.395 --> 00:59:13.796
to know that there are people
like you out there in the trenches,

00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:20.820
trying to coordinate this immense
and crucial effort on behalf of all of us,

00:59:20.844 --> 00:59:23.771
and also that there's
an organization out there,

00:59:23.795 --> 00:59:28.273
that your organization is tasked

00:59:28.297 --> 00:59:31.538
to carry any effective vaccine

00:59:31.562 --> 00:59:35.550
to the many billions of people
who may live in countries

00:59:35.574 --> 00:59:39.480
that can't afford to pay the same prices
that the West can pay.

00:59:39.504 --> 00:59:43.607
That's really cool that you're doing that,

00:59:43.631 --> 00:59:47.111
and thank you so much
for explaining so clearly to us

00:59:47.135 --> 00:59:48.641
what the situation is.

00:59:48.665 --> 00:59:52.132
I guess I speak for
the majority of people listening

00:59:52.156 --> 00:59:56.656
to say all power to you
with pulling these threads together.

00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:58.196
Thank you, Seth.

00:59:58.220 --> 00:59:59.373
WPR: Thank you, Seth.

00:59:59.397 --> 01:00:02.026
SB: Thank you, Chris and Whitney
and the TED community

01:00:02.050 --> 01:00:04.685
for all of your support over the years.

01:00:04.709 --> 01:00:08.208
Let's continue to use
science and technology

01:00:08.232 --> 01:00:11.161
for the good of the world
to solve problems like this.

01:00:11.185 --> 01:00:12.956
CA: Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.

01:00:13.385 --> 01:00:17.415
WPR: That was wonderful.

01:00:17.439 --> 01:00:19.982
I learned so much from this conversation.

01:00:20.006 --> 01:00:23.358
It seems like everyone online
also really did, which was helpful.

01:00:23.382 --> 01:00:26.984
And I'd like to remind everyone that,
if you missed part of this interview,

01:00:27.008 --> 01:00:29.774
you can watch it on our Facebook page
as soon as we finish,

01:00:29.798 --> 01:00:32.182
and then also --
and I'm going to read the link --

01:00:32.206 --> 01:00:34.900
it's go.ted.com/tedconnects.

01:00:34.924 --> 01:00:39.833
So our Facebook page,
or go.ted.com/tedconnects.

01:00:41.229 --> 01:00:43.449
CA: Thanks so much for joining us.

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:46.237
We get the sense people,

01:00:46.261 --> 01:00:50.612
literally all over the world
and in so many different circumstances,

01:00:50.636 --> 01:00:55.314
and yet, this moment has
given us a new excuse

01:00:55.338 --> 01:00:58.024
to bring you all together.

01:00:58.048 --> 01:00:59.249
Part of me,

01:00:59.273 --> 01:01:05.884
even though you really could wish
that we weren't in this situation,

01:01:05.908 --> 01:01:10.078
it does give us a chance to explore
some ideas in greater depth

01:01:10.102 --> 01:01:13.137
than we're normally able to,
to have these conversations.

01:01:13.161 --> 01:01:16.784
These are not 15-minute talks
on a red circle.

01:01:16.808 --> 01:01:19.200
You can just go a little bit deeper,

01:01:19.224 --> 01:01:21.629
and there's something
really cool about that

01:01:21.653 --> 01:01:24.149
that I think we want to do more of,

01:01:24.173 --> 01:01:29.577
and we want to figure out
how to hear from you and include you

01:01:29.601 --> 01:01:34.108
and make sure that your questions
and your thoughts are coming in.

01:01:34.132 --> 01:01:38.965
As we speak, we're dreaming up
what speakers to bring next.

01:01:38.989 --> 01:01:40.509
We know about Friday.

01:01:40.533 --> 01:01:42.368
We don't necessarily know beyond that.

01:01:42.392 --> 01:01:43.580
But watch this space.

01:01:43.604 --> 01:01:46.041
Whitney, talk about
what's going to happen tomorrow.

01:01:46.065 --> 01:01:47.460
WPR: So we're really excited.

01:01:47.484 --> 01:01:50.606
We're going to have Priya Parker
on to finish out the week for us.

01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:52.717
She is the author
of "The Art of Gathering,"

01:01:52.741 --> 01:01:55.632
and she's going to give us
some really helpful tips, I think,

01:01:55.656 --> 01:01:57.969
about how we can stay connected
during this time,

01:01:57.993 --> 01:02:00.676
which is something I'm sure
all of us are struggling with

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:02.857
as we're trying to practice
social distancing

01:02:02.881 --> 01:02:05.584
and are just spending more time
physically apart.

01:02:05.608 --> 01:02:08.613
So going into the weekend,
that feels like the type of thing

01:02:08.637 --> 01:02:11.338
I think all of us can
really benefit from hearing.

01:02:12.383 --> 01:02:16.139
CA: If you've got value
from this conversation,

01:02:16.163 --> 01:02:21.512
consider sharing it, sharing those links
with people you know.

01:02:21.536 --> 01:02:22.710
That would be cool.

01:02:22.734 --> 01:02:25.830
And hang in there, everyone.

01:02:25.854 --> 01:02:27.068
These are hard days.

01:02:27.092 --> 01:02:30.521
We know many people are struggling hugely.

01:02:30.545 --> 01:02:33.117
Hang in there. We'll get through it
together somehow.

01:02:33.141 --> 01:02:35.883
And until tomorrow, take care.

01:02:35.907 --> 01:02:37.439
Bye for now.

01:02:37.463 --> 01:02:39.282
WPR: Take care, everyone.
