00:00:09.517 --> 00:00:12.026
I have a question for you.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.465
Anybody in the audience
who doesn't have a plastic ID?

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.106
Anybody?

00:00:22.828 --> 00:00:24.911
Well, think about it.

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.410
Plastic is everywhere.

00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:30.801
The buttons on your shirt,

00:00:30.821 --> 00:00:32.151
your mobile cover,

00:00:32.171 --> 00:00:35.241
the water from the plastic
bottle you just had,

00:00:35.259 --> 00:00:38.439
plastic money in the wallet, maybe.

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:40.336
It is interesting

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:44.782
how plastic has become
an integral part of our lives

00:00:45.286 --> 00:00:50.047
and how we cannot go
one single day without it.

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:54.304
Do you know what that makes me think?

00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:59.468
How my generation is inheriting

00:01:00.201 --> 00:01:01.816
not just this legacy

00:01:02.236 --> 00:01:04.965
but also the problem that comes with it:

00:01:05.337 --> 00:01:08.366
the problem of what we throw
in our oceans.

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:10.206
Hello, everybody.

00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:11.867
My name is Haaziq Kazi.

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:14.732
I am 12 years old,

00:01:14.757 --> 00:01:17.785
and I alone have a plastic debt

00:01:17.805 --> 00:01:20.775
of roughly 66 tons and counting.

00:01:21.728 --> 00:01:24.353
So, in case you are wondering,

00:01:24.373 --> 00:01:26.073
What is plastic debt?

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:31.490
It is the amount of non-cycled plastic

00:01:31.514 --> 00:01:35.068
which we humans
leave behind on this planet.

00:01:36.281 --> 00:01:38.467
How many Indians in the house today?

00:01:38.492 --> 00:01:40.092
Raise your hands, please.

00:01:43.806 --> 00:01:45.505
According to a study,

00:01:45.525 --> 00:01:47.348
for every person in India,

00:01:47.818 --> 00:01:51.998
six tons of plastic
is not recycled annually.

00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:54.333
Any Americans here?

00:01:56.814 --> 00:02:00.447
Your figures are even more astounding.

00:02:00.472 --> 00:02:05.646
Ninety tons per person of plastic
which is not recycled, annually.

00:02:06.697 --> 00:02:12.427
Imagine, in a lifetime, how much plastic
is left behind because of us.

00:02:14.155 --> 00:02:17.833
When we die, our bodies
go back to Mother Earth,

00:02:18.465 --> 00:02:23.770
but the plastic debt is left behind 
as a legacy for the coming generations.

00:02:24.416 --> 00:02:27.039
Did you know that by 2050,

00:02:27.371 --> 00:02:33.246
we will have as much, or maybe more,
plastic in the ocean than fish?

00:02:33.776 --> 00:02:38.404
Speaking of which, every time
I see people eating fish,

00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:40.015
I wonder,

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:43.455
"Are they eating fish or plastic?"

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:48.720
Because the plastic we dispose
that ends up in the ocean

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.587
might have been consumed
by the same fish which gets on our plate -

00:02:54.768 --> 00:02:57.720
talk about the vicious karmic cycle.

00:03:00.292 --> 00:03:05.035
The magnitude of the problem
inspired me to do something about this.

00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:11.267
Hence, I came up
with an idea of an invention

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.860
that could help make the oceans
a cleaner place:

00:03:14.917 --> 00:03:17.396
an ocean cleaner called ERVIS.

00:03:17.918 --> 00:03:23.524
ERVIS is an intelligent ship
which sucks waste from the ocean surface

00:03:23.997 --> 00:03:25.302
and cleans it.

00:03:25.918 --> 00:03:27.785
It all started two years back.

00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:30.400
I saw some documentaries

00:03:30.423 --> 00:03:35.605
and a TED Talk of Boyan Slat
about how he wanted to clean the oceans.

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:41.373
A few days later, as I came home 
from playing football,

00:03:41.904 --> 00:03:43.978
my mom asked me to wash my hands,

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.770
and as I went to the sink 
to get the dirt off,

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.566
I observed a whirlpool of water
going down the drain.

00:03:52.822 --> 00:03:55.226
An idea came to my mind,

00:03:55.246 --> 00:03:56.886
and I smiled.

00:03:57.852 --> 00:04:00.696
I drew and created a rough model,

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.220
a circular ship with saucers attached,

00:04:04.923 --> 00:04:06.998
a very futuristic design,

00:04:07.015 --> 00:04:10.236
much like the USS Enterprise
from Star Trek.

00:04:10.615 --> 00:04:13.466
Come on, we all love the series.

00:04:13.966 --> 00:04:14.966
Right?

00:04:17.741 --> 00:04:20.363
This was just the first draft.

00:04:21.117 --> 00:04:23.370
The propellers weren't automated,

00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:29.035
and it only lasted seven seconds
in water before coming apart.

00:04:29.871 --> 00:04:31.156
But there it was:

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:33.077
my ERVIS,

00:04:33.097 --> 00:04:35.567
my vision of changing the oceans.

00:04:36.877 --> 00:04:40.999
While guzzling down
innumerable cups of hot chocolate -

00:04:41.732 --> 00:04:45.201
you know, I'm still a kid,
no coffee for me -

00:04:46.666 --> 00:04:51.408
I did some exhaustive research
to achieve my vision of ERVIS, which is:

00:04:52.226 --> 00:04:55.725
first, to clean the current waste
floating in the ocean;

00:04:56.317 --> 00:05:00.562
second, to analyze the data
from the waste which we collect;

00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:05.692
and third, to stop it at source,
which is getting disposed by the ships.

00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:11.756
I also realized that a circular shape
was not very efficient

00:05:12.218 --> 00:05:16.575
and that I had to redesign my ship
to be more hydrodynamic.

00:05:17.892 --> 00:05:23.885
So I worked with scientists and engineers
to create a more bleeding edge model.

00:05:24.504 --> 00:05:25.966
So here's how it works.

00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:29.798
The ship is essentially a large boat

00:05:29.822 --> 00:05:32.898
powered by solar
and renewable natural gas,

00:05:33.408 --> 00:05:34.955
with various compartments,

00:05:34.955 --> 00:05:36.888
and saucers surrounding it.

00:05:37.833 --> 00:05:40.323
The saucers float on the surface,

00:05:40.323 --> 00:05:44.778
gravitate to create a whirlpool
to pull the waste towards its center,

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:48.723
which is then sent through a tube
to various chambers in the ship.

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:54.921
The chambers include an oil chamber,
which collects waste oil.

00:05:56.381 --> 00:06:01.122
The next four chambers
are for large, medium, small,

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.310
and micro-waste, respectively.

00:06:04.637 --> 00:06:09.072
Just imagine ERVIS
to be a gigantic vacuum cleaner

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.014
with many cleaning tubes
attached to many dust bags.

00:06:15.574 --> 00:06:17.824
Once the waste enters the chambers,

00:06:18.307 --> 00:06:22.432
ERVIS analyzes, segregates,
and compacts it,

00:06:22.891 --> 00:06:25.411
and pumps the filtered water
back into the oceans,

00:06:26.274 --> 00:06:29.116
all without harming
marine life in the process.

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:35.837
ERVIS, the ship, is my contribution
in making the Earth a better place.

00:06:35.863 --> 00:06:37.193
(Applause)

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.644
And I hope, in some way,
it can inspire you to find your idea

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.407
which can bring a positive
change in the world.

00:06:44.734 --> 00:06:45.805
Thank you.

00:06:45.827 --> 00:06:47.828
(Applause) (Cheers)
