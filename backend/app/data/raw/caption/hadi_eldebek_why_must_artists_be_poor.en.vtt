00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.496
I come from a family of five brothers,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.240
all scientists and engineers.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
A few years ago,
I sent them the following email:

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.536
"Dear brothers, I hope
this message finds you well.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.696
I am emailing to let you know

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.856
that I'm dropping out
of my master's program in engineering

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.680
to pursue a career
as a full-time musician.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.520
All that I ask from you
is not to worry about me."

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.040
Brother number one replied.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.759
He was encouraging but a bit skeptical.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.696
He said, "I wish you the best of luck.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.056
You're going to need it."

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.456
(Laughter)

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.360
Brother number two
was a little bit more skeptical.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.776
He said, "Don't do it!

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.776
This will be the worst
mistake of your life.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.256
Find a real career."

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.856
(Laughter)

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.696
Well, the rest of my brothers
were so enthusiastic about my decision,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.456
they didn't even respond.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.216
(Laughter)

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.416
I know that the skepticism
coming from my brothers

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.495
is out of care and concern for me.

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:18.936
They were worried.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.496
They thought it would be difficult
to make it as an artist,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.016
that it will be a challenge.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.280
And you know what? They were right.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.976
It is such a challenge
to be a full-time artist.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.376
I have so many friends
who need to have a second job

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.616
as a plan B in order to pay for the bills,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.440
except that plan B
sometimes becomes their plan A.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.216
And it's not just my friends and I
who experience this.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.176
The US Census Bureau states that only
10 percent of art school graduates

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.296
end up working as full-time artists.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.776
The other 90 percent, they change careers,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.520
they work in marketing,
sales, education and other fields.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.616
But this is not news, right?

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.040
We almost expect the artist
to be a struggling artist.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.800
But why should we expect that?

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.936
I read an article in the "Huffington Post"

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.976
saying that four years ago,
the European Union

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.496
began the world's largest ever
arts funding initiative.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.136
Creative Europe
will give 2.4 billion dollars

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.840
to over 300,000 artists.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.976
In contrast, the US budget
for our National Endowment for the Arts,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.936
the largest single funder
for the arts across the United States,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.776
is merely 146 million dollars.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.936
To put things into perspective,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.096
the US budget for the military
marching bands alone

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.480
is almost twice as much as the entire NEA.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.096
Another striking image comes from
Brendan McMahon for the "Huffington Post,"

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.216
saying that out of
the one trillion dollar budget

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.056
for military and defense-related spending,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.456
if only 0.05 percent
were allocated to the arts,

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.776
we would be able to pay
for 20 full-time symphony orchestras

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.816
at 20 million dollars apiece,

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.296
and give over 80,000 artists

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.400
an annual salary of 50,000 dollars each.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.456
If that's only 0.05 percent,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.440
imagine what a full one percent could do.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.616
Now, I know we live
in a capitalist society,

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.720
and profits matter a lot.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.600
So let's look at it
from a financial angle, shall we?

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.656
The US nonprofit arts industry

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.496
generates more than 166 billion dollars
in economic activity,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.016
it employs 5.7 million people

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.976
and it returns 12.6 billion dollars

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.576
in tax revenue.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.856
But this is only a financial angle, right?

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.376
We all know that the arts is way more
than just an economic value.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.496
The arts brings meaning to life.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.480
It's the spirit of our culture.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.936
It brings people together
and it supports creativity

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.720
and social cohesion.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.456
But if the arts contributes
this much to our economy,

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.600
why then do we still invest
so little in arts and artists?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.576
Why do more than 80 percent
of our schools nationwide

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.000
still experience budget cuts
in arts education programs?

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.096
What is it about the value
of arts and artists

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.000
that we still don't understand?

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:37.776
I believe the system is flawed
and far from being fair,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.936
and I want to help change that.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.976
I want to live in a society

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.696
where artists are more valued

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.376
and have more cultural
and financial support

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.416
so they can focus on creating arts
instead of being forced to drive Ubers

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.120
or take corporate jobs
they'd rather not have.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.376
There are other sources of income
for artists, however.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.656
There are private foundations,

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.256
grants and patrons who give money,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.096
except a vast majority of artists
don't know about these opportunities.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.736
On one side you have institutions
and people with money.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.376
On the other side
you have artists seeking funding,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.216
but the artists don't know
about the people with the money,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.696
and the people with the money
don't necessarily know

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.096
about the artists out there.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.816
This is why I am very excited
to share "Grantpa,"

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.776
an online platform that uses technology

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.376
to match artists with grants
and funding opportunities

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.016
in a way that is easy, fast
and less intimidating.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.536
Grantpa is only one step
towards solving an existing problem

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.040
of funding inequality,

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.456
but we need to work collectively
on multiple fronts

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.800
to reevaluate how we view
the artists in our society.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.000
Do we think of arts
as a luxury or a necessity?

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.056
Do we understand what goes on
in the day-to-day life of an artist,

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.336
or do we still believe that artists,
no matter how struggling they are,

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.480
are happy simply because
they're following their passion?

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.360
In a few years, I plan to send
my brothers the following email:

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.400
"Dear brothers, I hope
this message finds you well.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.136
I am emailing to let you know
that I am doing great

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.656
and so are hundreds
of thousands of artists

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.176
who are being valued more
culturally and financially

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.216
and getting enough funding
to focus on their crafts

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.256
and create more art.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.576
I appreciate all of your support.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.536
Couldn't have done it without you."

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.776
Thank you.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.880
(Applause)
