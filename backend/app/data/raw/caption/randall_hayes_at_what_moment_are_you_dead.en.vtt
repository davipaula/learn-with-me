00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.942
For as far back
as we can trace our existence,

00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:14.692
humans have been fascinated 
with death and resurrection.

00:00:14.692 --> 00:00:18.648
Nearly every religion in the world 
has some interpretation of them,

00:00:18.648 --> 00:00:20.113
and from our earliest myths

00:00:20.113 --> 00:00:25.512
to the latest cinematic blockbusters,
the dead keep coming back.

00:00:25.512 --> 00:00:27.950
But is resurrection really possible?

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.602
And what is the actual difference between 
a living creature and a dead body, anyway?

00:00:33.602 --> 00:00:37.905
To understand what death is, 
we need to understand what life is.

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:41.371
One ancient theory 
was an idea called vitalism,

00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:43.817
which claimed 
that living things were unique

00:00:43.817 --> 00:00:47.440
because they were filled 
with a special substance, or energy,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.100
that was the essence of life.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.544
Whether it was called qi,

00:00:51.544 --> 00:00:52.469
lifeblood,

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.788
or humors,

00:00:53.788 --> 00:00:57.325
the belief in such an essence 
was common throughout the world,

00:00:57.325 --> 00:00:59.856
and still persists 
in the stories of creatures

00:00:59.856 --> 00:01:03.237
who can somehow drain life from others,

00:01:03.237 --> 00:01:07.371
or some form of magical sources 
that can replenish it.

00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:10.063
Vitalism began to fade 
in the Western world

00:01:10.063 --> 00:01:13.761
following the Scientific Revolution 
in the 17th century.

00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:15.611
RenÃ© Descartes advanced the notion

00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:20.067
that the human body was essentially 
no different from any other machine,

00:01:20.067 --> 00:01:26.159
brought to life by a divinely created soul
located in the brain's pineal gland.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.779
And in 1907, Dr. Duncan McDougall 
even claimed that the soul had mass,

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:37.789
weighing patients immediately
before and after death in an attempt to prove it.

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.601
Though his experiments were discredited,
much like the rest of vitalism,

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:45.236
traces of his theory 
still come up in popular culture.

00:01:45.236 --> 00:01:48.478
But where do all these discredited 
theories leave us?

00:01:48.478 --> 00:01:50.955
What we now know is 
that life is not contained

00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:53.683
in some magical substance or spark,

00:01:53.683 --> 00:01:58.139
but within the ongoing 
biological processes themselves.

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:59.874
And to understand these processes,

00:01:59.874 --> 00:02:04.104
we need to zoom down 
to the level of our individual cells.

00:02:04.104 --> 00:02:05.902
Inside each of these cells,

00:02:05.902 --> 00:02:09.078
chemical reactions 
are constantly occurring,

00:02:09.078 --> 00:02:12.746
powered by the glucose and oxygen
that our bodies convert

00:02:12.746 --> 00:02:17.079
into the energy-carrying molecule
known as ATP.

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.802
Cells use this energy
for everything from repair

00:02:19.802 --> 00:02:20.738
to growth

00:02:20.738 --> 00:02:22.437
to reproduction.

00:02:22.437 --> 00:02:25.858
Not only does it take a lot of energy 
to make the necessary molecules,

00:02:25.858 --> 00:02:29.943
but it takes even more 
to get them where they need to be.

00:02:29.943 --> 00:02:32.101
The universal phenomenon of entropy

00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:36.142
means that molecules will tend 
towards diffusing randomly,

00:02:36.142 --> 00:02:40.275
moving from areas 
of high concentration to low concentration,

00:02:40.275 --> 00:02:43.933
or even breaking apart 
into smaller molecules and atoms.

00:02:43.933 --> 00:02:47.433
So cells must constantly keep 
entropy in check

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.707
by using energy to maintain 
their molecules

00:02:49.707 --> 00:02:51.831
in the very complicated formations

00:02:51.831 --> 00:02:55.943
necessary for biological functions
to occur.

00:02:55.943 --> 00:03:00.078
The breaking down of these arrangements 
when the entire cell succumbs to entropy

00:03:00.078 --> 00:03:03.398
is what eventually results in death.

00:03:03.398 --> 00:03:07.129
This is the reason organisms 
can't be simply sparked back to life

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:08.936
once they've already died.

00:03:08.936 --> 00:03:11.321
We can pump air into someone's lungs,

00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:12.655
but it won't do much good

00:03:12.655 --> 00:03:15.986
if the many other processes
involved in the respiratory cycle

00:03:15.986 --> 00:03:18.260
are no longer functioning.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.064
Similarly, the electric shock
from a defibrillator

00:03:21.064 --> 00:03:23.800
doesn't jump-start an inanimate heart,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.195
but resynchronizes the muscle cells 
in an abnormally beating heart

00:03:28.195 --> 00:03:30.660
so they regain their normal rhythm.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.701
This can prevent a person from dying, 
but it won't raise a dead body,

00:03:34.701 --> 00:03:37.439
or a monster sewn together 
from dead bodies.

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.970
So it would seem 
that all our various medical miracles

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.273
can delay or prevent death
but not reverse it.

00:03:45.273 --> 00:03:47.387
But that's not as simple as it sounds

00:03:47.387 --> 00:03:50.893
because constant advancements 
in technology and medicine

00:03:50.893 --> 00:03:53.567
have resulted in diagnoses such as coma,

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:56.544
describing potentially 
reversible conditions,

00:03:56.544 --> 00:04:01.369
under which people would have previously 
been considered dead.

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:05.953
In the future, the point of no return 
may be pushed even further.

00:04:05.953 --> 00:04:08.665
Some animals are known 
to extend their lifespans

00:04:08.665 --> 00:04:10.985
or survive extreme conditions

00:04:10.985 --> 00:04:13.619
by slowing down their biological processes

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:16.797
to the point where 
they are virtually paused.

00:04:16.797 --> 00:04:20.111
And research into cryonics 
hopes to achieve the same

00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:23.517
by freezing dying people 
and reviving them later

00:04:23.517 --> 00:04:26.491
when newer technology 
is able to help them.

00:04:26.491 --> 00:04:30.757
See, if the cells are frozen, 
there's very little molecular movement,

00:04:30.757 --> 00:04:33.471
and diffusion practically stops.

00:04:33.471 --> 00:04:38.191
Even if all of a person's cellular 
processes had already broken down,

00:04:38.191 --> 00:04:42.358
this could still conceivably be reversed 
by a swarm of nanobots,

00:04:42.358 --> 00:04:45.125
moving all the molecules 
back to their proper positions,

00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:49.364
and injecting all of the cells 
with ATP at the same time,

00:04:49.364 --> 00:04:53.283
presumably causing the body 
to simply pick up where it left off.

00:04:53.283 --> 00:04:56.325
So if we think of life 
not as some magical spark,

00:04:56.325 --> 00:05:00.941
but a state of incredibly complex,
self-perpetuating organization,

00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:04.468
death is just 
the process of increasing entropy

00:05:04.468 --> 00:05:06.945
that destroys this fragile balance.

00:05:06.945 --> 00:05:09.541
And the point at which 
someone is completely dead

00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:12.111
turns out not to be a fixed constant,

00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:14.652
but simply a matter 
of how much of this entropy

00:05:14.652 --> 00:05:17.540
we're currently capable of reversing.
