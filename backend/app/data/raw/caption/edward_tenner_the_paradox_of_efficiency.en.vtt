00:00:12.542 --> 00:00:14.726
Who doesn't love efficiency?

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.018
I do.

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:19.393
Efficiency means more for less.

00:00:19.417 --> 00:00:23.309
More miles per gallon,
more light per watt,

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:24.792
more words per minute.

00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:28.393
More for less is the next best thing

00:00:28.417 --> 00:00:29.958
to something for nothing.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.059
Algorithms, big data, the cloud
are giving us more for less.

00:00:36.083 --> 00:00:39.726
Are we heading toward
a friction-free utopia

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.559
or toward a nightmare of surveillance?

00:00:42.583 --> 00:00:43.851
I don't know.

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:45.375
My interest is in the present.

00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:48.309
And I'd like to show you

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:52.309
how the past can help us
understand the present.

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.976
There's nothing that summarizes

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.768
both the promise
and the danger of efficiency

00:00:57.792 --> 00:00:59.768
like the humble potato.

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:02.309
The potato originated in the Andes

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:07.476
and it spread to Europe
from the ancient Inca.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.250
The potato is a masterpiece
of balanced nutrition.

00:01:13.458 --> 00:01:15.917
And it had some very powerful friends.

00:01:16.792 --> 00:01:19.476
King Frederick the Great of Prussia

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.643
was the first enthusiast.

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:25.018
He believed that the potato could help

00:01:25.042 --> 00:01:28.143
increase the population
of healthy Prussians.

00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:31.434
And the more healthy Prussians,

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:34.184
the more healthy Prussian soldiers.

00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:36.518
And some of those
healthy Prussian soldiers

00:01:36.542 --> 00:01:40.333
captured a French military
pharmacist named Parmentier.

00:01:41.292 --> 00:01:43.809
Parmentier, at first, was appalled

00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:47.601
by the morning, noon and night diet

00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:51.184
fed to POWs of potatoes,

00:01:51.208 --> 00:01:53.184
but he came to enjoy it.

00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:56.518
He thought they were making
him a healthier person.

00:01:56.542 --> 00:01:58.309
And so, when he was released,

00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:03.309
he took it on himself
to spread the potato to France.

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.809
And he had some powerful friends.

00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:10.643
Benjamin Franklin
advised him to hold a banquet,

00:02:10.667 --> 00:02:13.917
at which every dish included potatoes.

00:02:15.083 --> 00:02:17.500
And Franklin was a guest of honor.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.143
Even the king and queen of France

00:02:20.167 --> 00:02:24.309
were persuaded to wear potatoes,

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:25.976
potato flowers, pardon me.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.268
(Laughter)

00:02:27.292 --> 00:02:31.768
The king wore a potato
flower in his lapel,

00:02:31.792 --> 00:02:35.768
and the queen wore
a potato flower in her hair.

00:02:35.792 --> 00:02:39.643
That was a truly great
public relations idea.

00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:41.476
But there was a catch.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.059
The potato was too efficient
for Europe's good.

00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:47.393
In Ireland, it seemed a miracle.

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:50.559
Potatoes flourished, the population grew.

00:02:50.583 --> 00:02:52.518
But there was a hidden risk.

00:02:52.542 --> 00:02:55.851
Ireland's potatoes
were genetically identical.

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:59.643
They were a very efficient breed,
called the Lumper.

00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:02.018
And the problem with the Lumper

00:03:02.042 --> 00:03:05.893
was that a blight from South America

00:03:05.917 --> 00:03:07.601
that affected one potato

00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:09.000
would affect them all.

00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.434
Britain's exploitation
and callousness played a role,

00:03:13.458 --> 00:03:16.809
but it was because of this monoculture

00:03:16.833 --> 00:03:19.184
that a million people died

00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:22.750
and another two million
were forced to emigrate.

00:03:23.542 --> 00:03:26.059
A plant that was supposed to end famine

00:03:26.083 --> 00:03:28.625
created one of the most tragic ones.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.643
The problems of efficiency today

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:34.184
are less drastic but more chronic.

00:03:34.208 --> 00:03:36.184
They can also prolong the evils

00:03:36.208 --> 00:03:37.976
that they were intended to solve.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.268
Take the electronic medical records.

00:03:40.292 --> 00:03:44.351
It seemed to be the answer
to the problem of doctors' handwriting,

00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:45.934
and it had the benefit

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.268
of providing much better data
for treatments.

00:03:49.292 --> 00:03:51.393
In practice, instead, it has meant

00:03:51.417 --> 00:03:53.226
much more electronic paperwork

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.518
and physicians are now complaining
that they have less,

00:03:56.542 --> 00:04:00.875
rather than more time
to see patients individually.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.542
The obsession with efficiency
can actually make us less efficient.

00:04:06.292 --> 00:04:09.518
Efficiency also bites back
with false positives.

00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:13.226
Hospitals have hundreds
of devices registering alarms.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.309
Too often, they're crying wolf.

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:17.268
It takes time to rule those out.

00:04:17.292 --> 00:04:22.184
And that time results in fatigue,
stress and, once more,

00:04:22.208 --> 00:04:25.792
the neglect of the problems
of real patients.

00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:29.976
There are also false positives
in pattern recognition.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.143
A school bus, viewed from the wrong angle,

00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:34.292
can resemble a punching bag.

00:04:35.083 --> 00:04:37.309
So precious time is required

00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:40.268
to eliminate misidentification.

00:04:40.292 --> 00:04:42.893
False negatives are a problem, too.

00:04:42.917 --> 00:04:45.684
Algorithms can learn a lot -- fast.

00:04:45.708 --> 00:04:48.476
But they can tell us only about the past.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.601
So many future classics
get bad reviews, like "Moby Dick,"

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:55.809
or are turned down
by multiple publishers,

00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:57.643
like the "Harry Potter" series.

00:04:57.667 --> 00:05:02.018
It can be wasteful
to try to avoid all waste.

00:05:02.042 --> 00:05:05.726
Efficiency is also a trap
when the opposition copies it.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.893
Take the late 19th-century

00:05:07.917 --> 00:05:10.976
French 75-millimeter artillery piece.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.934
It was a masterpiece of lethal design.

00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:18.184
This piece could fire a shell
every four seconds.

00:05:18.208 --> 00:05:19.559
But that wasn't so unusual.

00:05:19.583 --> 00:05:23.726
What was really brilliant
was that because of the recoil mechanism,

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.601
it could return to the exact same position

00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:28.143
without having to be reaimed.

00:05:28.167 --> 00:05:32.018
So the effective rate of firing
was drastically increased.

00:05:32.042 --> 00:05:34.559
Now, this seemed to be a way for France

00:05:34.583 --> 00:05:38.333
to defeat Germany
the next time they fought.

00:05:39.042 --> 00:05:42.393
But, predictably, the Germans were working

00:05:42.417 --> 00:05:44.059
on something very similar.

00:05:44.083 --> 00:05:46.393
So when the First World War broke out,

00:05:46.417 --> 00:05:49.351
the result was the trench warfare

00:05:49.375 --> 00:05:52.809
that lasted longer
than anybody had expected.

00:05:52.833 --> 00:05:57.042
A technology that was designed
to shorten the war, prolonged it.

00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:01.726
The biggest cost of all
may be missed opportunities.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.393
The platform economy
connecting buyers and sellers

00:06:05.417 --> 00:06:06.893
can be a great investment,

00:06:06.917 --> 00:06:09.851
and we have seen that
in the last few weeks.

00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:13.434
Companies that are still losing
hundreds of millions of dollars

00:06:13.458 --> 00:06:17.208
may be creating billionaires
with initial public offerings.

00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:22.143
But the really difficult inventions

00:06:22.167 --> 00:06:24.726
are the physical and chemical ones.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.976
They mean bigger risks.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.309
They may be losing out,
because hardware is hard.

00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:34.518
It's much harder to scale up
a physical or chemical invention

00:06:34.542 --> 00:06:37.250
than it is a software-based invention.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.476
Think of batteries.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.643
Lithium-ion batteries
in portable devices and electric cars

00:06:43.667 --> 00:06:46.333
are based on a 30-year-old principle.

00:06:47.042 --> 00:06:49.476
How many smartphone batteries today

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.792
will last a full day on a single charge?

00:06:53.542 --> 00:06:55.167
Yes, hardware is hard.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:06:59.559
It took over 20 years for the patent

00:06:59.583 --> 00:07:01.934
on the principle of dry photocopying,

00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:05.143
by Chester Carlson in 1938,

00:07:05.167 --> 00:07:12.083
to result in the Xerox 914 copier
introduced in 1959.

00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:17.934
The small, brave company,
Haloid in Rochester, NY

00:07:17.958 --> 00:07:22.893
had to go through what most corporations
would never have tolerated.

00:07:22.917 --> 00:07:24.726
There was one failure after another,

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.018
and one of the special problems was fire.

00:07:28.042 --> 00:07:31.851
In fact, when the 914
was finally released,

00:07:31.875 --> 00:07:36.768
it still had a device
that was called a scorch eliminator

00:07:36.792 --> 00:07:41.083
but actually it was
a small fire extinguisher built in.

00:07:42.167 --> 00:07:46.809
My answer to all these questions is:
inspired inefficiency.

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:50.893
Data and measurement are essential,
but they're not enough.

00:07:50.917 --> 00:07:54.851
Let's leave room for human intuition
and human skills.

00:07:54.875 --> 00:07:58.684
There are seven facets
of inspired inefficiency.

00:07:58.708 --> 00:08:02.476
First, take the scenic route,
say yes to serendipity.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.059
Wrong turns can be productive.

00:08:05.083 --> 00:08:08.184
Once, when I was exploring
the east bank of the Mississippi,

00:08:08.208 --> 00:08:10.184
I took the wrong turn.

00:08:10.208 --> 00:08:13.893
I was approaching a toll bridge
crossing the great river,

00:08:13.917 --> 00:08:17.393
and the toll collector
said I could not turn back.

00:08:17.417 --> 00:08:20.851
So I paid my 50 cents --
that's all it was at the time --

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:24.184
and I was in Muscatine, Iowa.

00:08:24.208 --> 00:08:26.101
I had barely heard of Muscatine,

00:08:26.125 --> 00:08:29.268
but it proved to be a fascinating place.

00:08:29.292 --> 00:08:33.601
Muscatine had some
of the world's richest mussel beds.

00:08:33.625 --> 00:08:36.726
A century ago,
a third of the world's buttons

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.559
were produced in Muscatine,

00:08:38.583 --> 00:08:41.143
1.5 billion a year.

00:08:41.167 --> 00:08:43.434
The last plants have closed now,

00:08:43.458 --> 00:08:46.976
but there is still a museum
of the pearl button industry

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.976
that's one of the most
unusual in the world.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.809
But buttons were only the beginning.

00:08:51.833 --> 00:08:53.726
This is the house in Muscatine

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.809
where China's future
president stayed in 1986,

00:08:56.833 --> 00:08:59.518
as a member of an agricultural delegation.

00:08:59.542 --> 00:09:02.643
It is now the Sino-US Friendship House,

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:05.768
and it's a pilgrimage site
for Chinese tourists.

00:09:05.792 --> 00:09:07.518
How could I have foreseen that?

00:09:07.542 --> 00:09:08.792
(Laughter)

00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:13.601
Second, get up from the couch.

00:09:13.625 --> 00:09:15.809
Sometimes it can be more efficient

00:09:15.833 --> 00:09:17.393
to do things the hard way.

00:09:17.417 --> 00:09:19.351
Consider the internet of things.

00:09:19.375 --> 00:09:22.018
It's wonderful
to be able to control lights,

00:09:22.042 --> 00:09:25.018
set the thermostat, even vacuum the room

00:09:25.042 --> 00:09:26.893
without leaving one's seat.

00:09:26.917 --> 00:09:29.143
But medical research has shown

00:09:29.167 --> 00:09:32.393
that actually fidgeting,
getting up, walking around

00:09:32.417 --> 00:09:35.601
is one of the best things
you can do for your heart.

00:09:35.625 --> 00:09:37.708
It's good for the heart and the waistline.

00:09:38.917 --> 00:09:41.934
Third, monetize your mistakes.

00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:43.684
Great forms can be created

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:46.851
by imaginative development of accidents.

00:09:46.875 --> 00:09:49.809
Tad Leski, an architect
of the Metropolitan Opera

00:09:49.833 --> 00:09:51.101
at Lincoln Center,

00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:55.042
was working on a sketch
and some white ink fell on the drawing.

00:09:56.125 --> 00:09:59.059
Other people might just
have thrown it away,

00:09:59.083 --> 00:10:03.893
but Leski was inspired
to produce a starburst chandelier

00:10:03.917 --> 00:10:08.417
that was probably the most notable
of its kind of the 20th century.

00:10:09.292 --> 00:10:12.184
Fourth, sometimes try the hard way.

00:10:12.208 --> 00:10:15.559
It can be more efficient
to be less fluent.

00:10:15.583 --> 00:10:18.393
Psychologists call this
desirable difficulty.

00:10:18.417 --> 00:10:20.851
Taking detailed notes with a keyboard

00:10:20.875 --> 00:10:24.309
would seem to be the best way
to grasp what a lecturer is saying,

00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:27.476
to be able to review it verbatim.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.476
However, studies have shown
that when we have to abbreviate,

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.559
when we have to summarize
what a speaker is saying,

00:10:34.583 --> 00:10:38.976
when we're taking notes
with a pen or a pencil on paper,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.976
we're processing that information.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.851
We're making that our own,

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:45.184
and we are learning much more actively

00:10:45.208 --> 00:10:48.934
than when we were just transcribing

00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.809
what was being said.

00:10:50.833 --> 00:10:53.559
Fifth, get security through diversity.

00:10:53.583 --> 00:10:55.101
Monoculture can be deadly.

00:10:55.125 --> 00:10:56.559
Remember the potato?

00:10:56.583 --> 00:10:58.643
It was efficient until it wasn't.

00:10:58.667 --> 00:11:01.208
Diversity applies to organizations, too.

00:11:02.042 --> 00:11:07.726
Software can tell what has made people
in an organization succeed in the past.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.893
And it's useful, sometimes,
in screening employees.

00:11:10.917 --> 00:11:15.018
But remember, the environment
is constantly changing,

00:11:15.042 --> 00:11:18.976
and software, screening software,
has no way to tell,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.434
and we have no way to tell,

00:11:20.458 --> 00:11:23.934
who is going to be useful in the future.

00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:28.809
So, we need to supplement
whatever the algorithm tells us

00:11:28.833 --> 00:11:31.726
by an intuition and by looking for people

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:35.226
with various backgrounds
and various outlooks.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.684
Sixth, achieve safety
through redundancy and human skills.

00:11:39.708 --> 00:11:43.268
Why did two 737 Max aircraft crash?

00:11:43.292 --> 00:11:45.393
We still don't know the full story,

00:11:45.417 --> 00:11:48.226
but we know how to
prevent future tragedies.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.851
We need multiple independent systems.

00:11:50.875 --> 00:11:54.893
If one fails, then the others
can override it.

00:11:54.917 --> 00:11:58.351
We also need skilled operators
to come to the rescue

00:11:58.375 --> 00:12:00.934
and that means constant training.

00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:04.143
Seventh, be rationally extravagant.

00:12:04.167 --> 00:12:06.851
Thomas Edison was a pioneer
of the film industry,

00:12:06.875 --> 00:12:09.268
as well as of camera technology.

00:12:09.292 --> 00:12:13.268
Nobody has done more
for efficiency than Thomas Edison.

00:12:13.292 --> 00:12:15.125
But his cost cutting broke down.

00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:18.934
His manager hired
a so-called efficiency engineer,

00:12:18.958 --> 00:12:21.268
who advised him to save money

00:12:21.292 --> 00:12:24.851
by using more of the film stock
that he'd shot,

00:12:24.875 --> 00:12:26.559
having fewer retakes.

00:12:26.583 --> 00:12:27.851
Well, Edison was a genius,

00:12:27.875 --> 00:12:31.309
but he didn't understand
the new rules of feature films

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:36.684
and the fact that failure
was becoming the price of success.

00:12:36.708 --> 00:12:40.101
On the other hand, some great directors,
like Erich Von Stroheim,

00:12:40.125 --> 00:12:41.393
were the opposite.

00:12:41.417 --> 00:12:42.809
They were superb dramatists,

00:12:42.833 --> 00:12:46.101
and Stroheim was also a memorable actor.

00:12:46.125 --> 00:12:48.268
But they couldn't live
within their budgets.

00:12:48.292 --> 00:12:50.042
So that was not sustainable.

00:12:51.208 --> 00:12:55.184
It was Irving Thalberg,
a former secretary with intuitive genius,

00:12:55.208 --> 00:12:57.559
who achieved rational extravagance.

00:12:57.583 --> 00:13:00.601
First at Universal, and then at MGM,

00:13:00.625 --> 00:13:04.809
becoming the ideal
of the Hollywood producer.

00:13:04.833 --> 00:13:08.101
Summing up, to be truly efficient,

00:13:08.125 --> 00:13:10.643
we need optimal inefficiency.

00:13:10.667 --> 00:13:13.268
The shortest path may be a curve

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:15.434
rather than a straight line.

00:13:15.458 --> 00:13:17.643
Charles Darwin understood that.

00:13:17.667 --> 00:13:19.434
When he encountered a tough problem,

00:13:19.458 --> 00:13:21.226
he made a circuit of a trail,

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:24.125
the sandwalk that he'd built
behind his house.

00:13:24.875 --> 00:13:28.101
A productive path
can be physical, like Darwin's,

00:13:28.125 --> 00:13:31.559
or a virtual one, or an unforeseen detour

00:13:31.583 --> 00:13:34.059
from a path we had laid out.

00:13:34.083 --> 00:13:36.518
Too much efficiency can weaken itself.

00:13:36.542 --> 00:13:40.976
But a bit of inspired inefficiency
can strengthen it.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.976
Sometimes, the best way to move forward

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.851
is to follow a circle.

00:13:46.875 --> 00:13:48.184
Thank you.

00:13:48.208 --> 00:13:51.042
(Applause)
