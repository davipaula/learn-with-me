00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:16.182
By the year 2050, the population
of Africa will have doubled.

00:00:17.406 --> 00:00:20.786
One in four people on Earth
will be African at that point,

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.968
and this is both really exciting
and daunting all at once.

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.663
It's really exciting because,
for the first time in the modern era,

00:00:27.687 --> 00:00:30.870
there will be enough Africans on the Earth
to bully everybody else.

00:00:30.894 --> 00:00:32.084
(Laughter)

00:00:32.108 --> 00:00:34.081
I'm only kidding.

00:00:34.105 --> 00:00:37.107
But it's daunting, because we're going
to have to have economies

00:00:37.131 --> 00:00:39.069
that can sustain this population growth,

00:00:39.093 --> 00:00:41.597
and many of the people
are going to be very young.

00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:45.291
Now most of governments in Africa
have a plan for this economic growth --

00:00:45.315 --> 00:00:47.923
in Kenya, we call ours Vision2030 --

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:50.454
and they're all predicated
on industrialization.

00:00:51.327 --> 00:00:53.102
The thing is, though, that the world

00:00:53.126 --> 00:00:55.968
is going through the Fourth
Industrial Revolution right now,

00:00:55.992 --> 00:00:57.565
which means that there's a merger

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.764
of the physical, cyber,
and biological worlds.

00:00:59.788 --> 00:01:03.550
It means that because of
massive interconnectivity

00:01:03.574 --> 00:01:07.091
and the availability
of artificial intelligence and robotics,

00:01:07.115 --> 00:01:09.688
many of the jobs that we know
and are used to right now

00:01:09.712 --> 00:01:11.163
won't exist in the future.

00:01:11.187 --> 00:01:13.425
So the challenge
is a lot greater, in many ways,

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:16.571
than it even was when Asia
was industrializing, for example.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.668
To add to this, one of the kinds
of person that you need

00:01:21.692 --> 00:01:23.843
for industrialization is an engineer,

00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:26.319
and they're really in short supply
on the continent.

00:01:26.343 --> 00:01:28.840
If you compare, for example,
the number of engineers

00:01:28.864 --> 00:01:30.622
that those same Asian countries had

00:01:30.646 --> 00:01:33.294
a couple of decades ago
when they were industrializing,

00:01:33.318 --> 00:01:35.264
we fall far short.

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:37.655
And I've taught for a while,

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.177
and many of the students
who are studying engineering

00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:43.476
end up actually working
in auditing firms and banks,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.556
and many of them spend half their time
doing accounting and so on

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.929
as they're preparing.

00:01:48.538 --> 00:01:52.825
Now, I was fortunate enough
to do my undergrad and postgrad education

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:55.388
in the UK and the US,
in countries, environments,

00:01:55.412 --> 00:01:58.094
where there was all the equipment
that you required,

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.221
all the sophistication in the systems,

00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:02.539
and then I worked
for about three years in Japan

00:02:02.563 --> 00:02:04.499
doing R&amp;D for a large firm.

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:06.785
And so I was very used
to having good equipment,

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:07.973
and went back home

00:02:07.997 --> 00:02:11.175
and joined the Faculty of Engineering
at the University of Nairobi,

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:13.355
wanting to contribute
and be on the continent.

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.863
And I quickly found
I was really quite useless,

00:02:15.887 --> 00:02:20.548
because there wasn't all the equipment
that I had become accustomed to available.

00:02:20.572 --> 00:02:24.596
And I was teaching students who I would
find very bright ideas in their minds

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.621
and they'd be presenting
things that I knew

00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:28.422
if only we had sufficient equipment,

00:02:28.446 --> 00:02:33.271
they'd be able to really contribute
to the challenge of industrialization.

00:02:33.708 --> 00:02:37.677
So I kind of had to change hats,
and became quite entrepreneurial

00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:41.177
and started looking for money
to buy the equipment that we required.

00:02:41.201 --> 00:02:44.693
And I heard about a concept
out of MIT, called the Fab Labs.

00:02:45.072 --> 00:02:47.075
These are digital fabrication labs

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.687
that allow, in a rather small space
with not very expensive equipment,

00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:52.826
people to have access to these tools

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.978
to be able to make almost anything,

00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:56.175
as the slogan goes.

00:02:56.728 --> 00:02:59.430
And so I was able to convince
a government official

00:02:59.454 --> 00:03:02.288
to buy one of these for the university
where I was teaching.

00:03:02.312 --> 00:03:04.312
And immediately, we had wonderful results.

00:03:04.336 --> 00:03:06.629
We saw all kinds
of innovations coming through,

00:03:06.653 --> 00:03:09.463
and for the first time
in this context at the university,

00:03:09.487 --> 00:03:13.098
engineering students
from different disciplines

00:03:13.122 --> 00:03:17.025
were doing the lab and practical exercises
together in the same space.

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.900
Normally, they'd be siloed.

00:03:18.924 --> 00:03:21.800
And not just that, but students
who weren't engineers at all

00:03:21.824 --> 00:03:23.726
were also working in the same place,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.933
and non-students, people
who had nothing to do with the university,

00:03:26.957 --> 00:03:28.560
were also coming into this space.

00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:30.251
So you had this rich mix of people,

00:03:30.275 --> 00:03:32.420
people who think
differently from one another,

00:03:32.444 --> 00:03:34.829
and this always
is really good for innovation.

00:03:34.853 --> 00:03:36.941
I was really proud of what we were seeing.

00:03:36.965 --> 00:03:38.409
So you can imagine my surprise

00:03:38.433 --> 00:03:41.447
when one day the dean of engineering
came and said to me,

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:45.368
"Kamau, the students
who spend most of the time in the Fab Lab

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:46.780
are failing their exams."

00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:48.828
I said, "What do you mean?"

00:03:49.791 --> 00:03:52.179
And I looked into it, and he was right,

00:03:52.203 --> 00:03:53.766
and the reason they were failing

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.581
is that they'd honed their skills
so well in certain things

00:03:56.605 --> 00:04:00.057
that they were going out into the city
and offering services for money.

00:04:00.081 --> 00:04:01.498
So they were making money --

00:04:01.522 --> 00:04:02.573
(Laughter)

00:04:02.597 --> 00:04:05.328
and they therefore
weren't focusing on their studies.

00:04:05.352 --> 00:04:07.409
And I thought,
what a good problem to have.

00:04:07.433 --> 00:04:08.449
(Laughter)

00:04:08.473 --> 00:04:10.584
Don't quote me on that.
I'm an academician.

00:04:11.613 --> 00:04:14.217
So we needed to scale this,

00:04:14.241 --> 00:04:17.423
and at the university,
things were a bit too bureaucratic,

00:04:17.447 --> 00:04:20.662
and so I moved out and I hooked up
with people who, in Nairobi,

00:04:20.686 --> 00:04:23.336
were providing spaces for IT experts

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.043
to share fast internet
and things like that.

00:04:26.067 --> 00:04:28.390
And some of these places
are really quite famous.

00:04:28.414 --> 00:04:30.836
They've made Kenya famous for IT.

00:04:31.774 --> 00:04:36.282
And together we set up a space
which we are setting up right now.

00:04:36.306 --> 00:04:37.895
We've moved from where we were.

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.439
We are in a much larger space,

00:04:39.463 --> 00:04:42.967
and we're sort of making available
a wide range of equipment,

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:45.824
including the digital fabrication
tools that I mentioned,

00:04:45.848 --> 00:04:47.325
and analog tools,

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:49.865
to anybody really, on a membership basis.

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.144
It's a bit like a gym,
so you come in, you pay,

00:04:52.168 --> 00:04:54.082
you get taught how to use the equipment,

00:04:54.106 --> 00:04:57.821
and then you're set free to innovate
and do whatever it is that you want,

00:04:57.845 --> 00:05:00.474
and you don't have to be
an engineer, necessarily.

00:05:00.498 --> 00:05:03.689
And some of the people in the space
are setting up a small company.

00:05:03.713 --> 00:05:05.383
They just need a space at a desk,

00:05:05.407 --> 00:05:06.980
and so we provide that at a fee,

00:05:07.004 --> 00:05:10.290
and others take up bigger spaces
and are able to set up their offices.

00:05:10.314 --> 00:05:11.546
They're further along.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.666
Maybe their company has been running
for a certain period of time.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.759
And so we're able
to accommodate all of this

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:20.512
in an innovation space
that is really quite active.

00:05:20.966 --> 00:05:23.761
What you're seeing in this image
over here is Douglas,

00:05:23.785 --> 00:05:25.681
and Douglas is an electrical engineer,

00:05:25.705 --> 00:05:28.355
one of the people
who was really active in the Fab Lab.

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:30.197
I'm pretty sure he passed his exams.

00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:33.460
And the image on the top left
is a copper sheet.

00:05:33.857 --> 00:05:36.842
And he designed a circuit
that the client came to him and said,

00:05:36.866 --> 00:05:39.930
"I need this circuit
for a pay-as-you-go system."

00:05:39.954 --> 00:05:42.341
And so this is a model for business

00:05:42.365 --> 00:05:47.166
that's made accessibility to goods
and services for very poor people

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.103
really much easier,
because they're able to pay a little bit,

00:05:50.127 --> 00:05:51.922
like a dollar a day, for example,

00:05:51.946 --> 00:05:53.594
for a specific service.

00:05:53.618 --> 00:05:56.603
And so this company wanted
to pilot a new idea that they had,

00:05:56.627 --> 00:05:58.412
and so they just needed 50 circuits,

00:05:58.436 --> 00:05:59.914
so they hired him to make them,

00:05:59.938 --> 00:06:02.017
and what you're seeing him doing there is,

00:06:02.041 --> 00:06:05.357
he's able to design on the computer
what the circuit will be

00:06:05.381 --> 00:06:07.485
and then transfer it
to an etching process --

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:09.225
that's the image on the top right --

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:12.493
and then populate the board
using this robot.

00:06:12.517 --> 00:06:17.208
And so what would normally take him maybe
a day or something to solder by hand,

00:06:17.232 --> 00:06:19.431
he can do in a few minutes
using this machine.

00:06:19.455 --> 00:06:22.248
So he was able to complete
the entire order within Gearbox,

00:06:22.272 --> 00:06:23.692
and this is really important,

00:06:23.716 --> 00:06:26.479
because if it wasn't for
what we provided right now,

00:06:26.503 --> 00:06:30.386
he would have had to have hired
a company in China to do this,

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.670
and because it's such a small order,
it would have taken a long time.

00:06:33.694 --> 00:06:35.210
It would be a small company,

00:06:35.234 --> 00:06:37.559
because big companies
wouldn't take small orders,

00:06:37.583 --> 00:06:39.584
and even then, if they got a bigger order,

00:06:39.608 --> 00:06:41.742
they'd bump him off in favor of that.

00:06:41.766 --> 00:06:43.672
And there's language problems and so on,

00:06:43.696 --> 00:06:46.473
so being able to do it in country
is really very important,

00:06:46.497 --> 00:06:51.871
and of course piloting as a phase
within the progress of the business idea

00:06:51.895 --> 00:06:55.680
is extremely important, because you can
go back and make corrections and so on.

00:06:56.836 --> 00:06:58.609
In this image -- Thank you.

00:06:58.633 --> 00:07:00.459
(Applause)

00:07:00.483 --> 00:07:02.294
In this image you see on the top left,

00:07:02.318 --> 00:07:05.653
what you're looking at is a 3D render
of a digital fabrication machine.

00:07:05.677 --> 00:07:08.595
In this instance,
it doubles as a plasma cutter

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:10.326
and also a wood router.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.334
And so the plasma cutter makes possible
the cutting of plate and sheet metal,

00:07:15.358 --> 00:07:17.603
and basically, you make
a design on the computer

00:07:17.627 --> 00:07:19.183
and send it over to the machine,

00:07:19.207 --> 00:07:22.263
and then quickly and precisely,
it will cut the shapes you want.

00:07:22.287 --> 00:07:23.444
But in this machine,

00:07:23.468 --> 00:07:27.153
you can also change the plasma cutter
and put on a spindle,

00:07:27.177 --> 00:07:29.343
and then you can carve wood as well.

00:07:29.367 --> 00:07:31.971
So this was designed
by my Head of Engineering.

00:07:31.995 --> 00:07:33.463
His name is Wachira,

00:07:33.487 --> 00:07:36.191
and when I hired him about two years ago,

00:07:36.215 --> 00:07:38.099
I asked him, "Just give me two years,

00:07:38.123 --> 00:07:40.305
and by the time you've trained
a lot of people

00:07:40.329 --> 00:07:42.354
so that we have good staff under you,

00:07:42.378 --> 00:07:44.930
then you can move out
and become a good story for us."

00:07:44.954 --> 00:07:46.902
And that's exactly what's just happened.

00:07:46.926 --> 00:07:49.196
He's got two types of customers.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.824
The higher-tier customer

00:07:51.848 --> 00:07:54.419
is a company that's actually
using his machine

00:07:54.443 --> 00:07:58.277
to cut sheet metal
for Isuzu truck fabrication in Nairobi,

00:07:58.301 --> 00:08:00.348
which is being done by General Motors.

00:08:00.372 --> 00:08:02.253
So we're really proud to be able to say

00:08:02.277 --> 00:08:05.611
that we have an original
equipment manufacturer in Nairobi

00:08:05.635 --> 00:08:08.382
that's provided what's effectively
an industrial robot

00:08:08.406 --> 00:08:10.841
to supply parts for General Motors.

00:08:11.451 --> 00:08:12.969
Now this is really important --

00:08:12.993 --> 00:08:15.750
(Applause)

00:08:15.774 --> 00:08:19.972
and it's really important because
the population growth being what it is,

00:08:19.996 --> 00:08:22.695
a lot of very large companies
are looking very closely

00:08:22.719 --> 00:08:24.785
at the market that's developing in Africa.

00:08:24.809 --> 00:08:27.634
So in Kenya right now, we have
Volkswagen, Peugeot, Renault,

00:08:27.658 --> 00:08:29.203
we have Mercedes doing lorries,

00:08:29.227 --> 00:08:31.970
and we've also got Toyota,
they've been there a long time.

00:08:31.994 --> 00:08:34.853
And these are all manufacturers
planning to assemble vehicles

00:08:34.877 --> 00:08:37.179
and in the future,
to manufacture in the country.

00:08:37.203 --> 00:08:40.347
Many of them are planning
to train lots of people that they'd hire,

00:08:40.371 --> 00:08:42.420
and that's really important
for the economy,

00:08:42.444 --> 00:08:44.077
but when the magic really happens,

00:08:44.101 --> 00:08:48.102
when these companies begin to buy
their parts for the vehicles

00:08:48.126 --> 00:08:49.417
from local companies,

00:08:49.441 --> 00:08:52.377
so supply chain development
is something that's very important

00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:55.584
for us to be able to pivot
and to have very productive economies,

00:08:55.608 --> 00:08:58.107
and that's something
we're focused on at our space.

00:08:58.799 --> 00:09:02.578
This other image shows
another class of customer that he has.

00:09:02.602 --> 00:09:03.753
On the top left,

00:09:03.777 --> 00:09:06.721
you have these people
who are actually using very crude tools

00:09:06.745 --> 00:09:08.628
to work metal and wood.

00:09:08.652 --> 00:09:11.926
And Kenya has a population
of about 44 million people.

00:09:12.792 --> 00:09:14.808
The work force is about 13 million,

00:09:14.832 --> 00:09:18.396
and about 80 to 90 percent of those
are in the informal sector.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.357
And what you're seeing in the image
at the top left over there

00:09:21.381 --> 00:09:25.024
is very typical of semi-skilled artisans

00:09:25.048 --> 00:09:27.612
who are making products
for the marketplace

00:09:27.636 --> 00:09:28.799
that are really crude.

00:09:28.823 --> 00:09:30.724
Their production rate is very slow.

00:09:30.748 --> 00:09:32.989
The quality of the product isn't high.

00:09:33.013 --> 00:09:36.037
And so we've teamed
Wachira up with a bank,

00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:39.179
and the bank is paying him
to train people from this sector

00:09:39.203 --> 00:09:41.092
on how to use this industrial robot.

00:09:42.131 --> 00:09:44.600
And the result is that some of them

00:09:44.624 --> 00:09:48.585
are going to be able to get loans
to buy the machine for themselves.

00:09:48.609 --> 00:09:52.108
Others will be able to go to centers
where they can carry their material,

00:09:52.132 --> 00:09:53.403
get the design done,

00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:56.927
and take the materials back
that have been made really, really fast

00:09:56.951 --> 00:09:58.809
and assemble them in their own spaces.

00:09:58.833 --> 00:10:01.618
So somebody making a gate,
for example, out of metal,

00:10:01.642 --> 00:10:03.578
may take a week to make just one gate,

00:10:03.602 --> 00:10:06.055
but with this machine,
they might make 10 in a day.

00:10:06.079 --> 00:10:08.751
So the productivity of a large swathe
of our population

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:13.653
should be able to jump by a quantum
amount, quite significantly,

00:10:13.677 --> 00:10:15.232
because of this kind of machine.

00:10:15.256 --> 00:10:18.848
And that's what we're at the beginning of,
so this is really very exciting.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.391
This is another person who uses our space.

00:10:21.415 --> 00:10:22.566
Her name is Esther.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:23.741
She's in her mid-20s,

00:10:23.765 --> 00:10:26.937
and she came in very passionate
about a problem that she explained.

00:10:26.961 --> 00:10:30.343
She said that schools days are missed
every month by young girls

00:10:30.367 --> 00:10:31.962
because of their menstrual cycle,

00:10:31.986 --> 00:10:34.499
and they're not able
to buy a sanitary towel.

00:10:34.523 --> 00:10:36.555
And the reason that she described

00:10:36.579 --> 00:10:40.547
was that the manufacturers
packaged these in bundles of seven to 10,

00:10:40.571 --> 00:10:44.032
and breaking it down
is unhygienic at the retail level,

00:10:44.056 --> 00:10:46.738
and packaging each one
of them is too expensive.

00:10:46.762 --> 00:10:49.937
So she thought up an idea,
which is brilliant, and simple.

00:10:49.961 --> 00:10:51.820
Why don't we just use vending machines?

00:10:51.844 --> 00:10:55.035
And she, in a very clean environment,
can break down the bundles

00:10:55.059 --> 00:10:56.932
and fill up the vending machines,

00:10:56.956 --> 00:10:59.981
and then girls can buy
these sanitary towels

00:11:00.005 --> 00:11:04.171
in the privacy of a toilet,
in a public space, in a school, and so on.

00:11:04.195 --> 00:11:07.148
She was able to pilot this
and it worked really very well,

00:11:07.172 --> 00:11:09.888
and she's been able to sort of
get the bugs out and so on.

00:11:09.912 --> 00:11:13.373
So the significance here
is that the piloting process is possible.

00:11:13.397 --> 00:11:14.630
She's not an engineer.

00:11:14.654 --> 00:11:18.287
She was able to engage people in our space
to be able to help her to do this,

00:11:18.311 --> 00:11:21.039
and she's off and running now
with a business accelerator,

00:11:21.063 --> 00:11:22.704
so we expect to see great results.

00:11:22.728 --> 00:11:25.805
(Applause)

00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:27.813
In this image you're looking at --

00:11:27.837 --> 00:11:31.781
the result of a master's project
that was done at University of Nairobi

00:11:31.805 --> 00:11:33.731
by Tony Nyagah, an engineering student,

00:11:33.755 --> 00:11:36.862
and he just integrated
a solar cell into a roof tile

00:11:36.886 --> 00:11:38.569
and decided to make it a business.

00:11:38.593 --> 00:11:40.891
He joined up with his sister
who is an architect,

00:11:40.915 --> 00:11:42.262
and they have this business,

00:11:42.286 --> 00:11:45.952
and they present the roof tile to a person
who is doing development and say,

00:11:45.976 --> 00:11:49.551
"You can buy it for the cost
of just the roof tile without the solar."

00:11:49.575 --> 00:11:51.397
So they're giving it at a discount,

00:11:51.421 --> 00:11:55.025
and then they'll build them
using the internet of things over time,

00:11:55.049 --> 00:11:59.219
they'll pay about a third
of the utility charges for the electricity

00:11:59.243 --> 00:12:01.623
and they can sell the excess
back to the grid.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.482
And so they'll make their money over time,

00:12:04.506 --> 00:12:07.759
and they've been able to do
quite a few installments.

00:12:07.783 --> 00:12:11.839
We were very proud to be able
to show this to somebody kind of famous,

00:12:11.863 --> 00:12:13.514
as you can see there,

00:12:13.538 --> 00:12:16.499
and this other famous guy
actually presented the same idea,

00:12:16.523 --> 00:12:19.144
but as far as we're concerned,
if it was after us, so --

00:12:19.168 --> 00:12:20.212
(Laughter)

00:12:20.236 --> 00:12:24.514
(Applause)

00:12:24.538 --> 00:12:28.760
So in closing, going forward,
of course being able to prototype

00:12:28.784 --> 00:12:31.156
and do low manufacturing
in this kind of a setting

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.704
is very important
for the industrialization process,

00:12:33.728 --> 00:12:36.967
but we're also taking advantage
of a lot of new ways of doing things:

00:12:36.991 --> 00:12:38.247
the open source movement,

00:12:38.271 --> 00:12:40.563
distributive manufacturing,
circular production.

00:12:40.587 --> 00:12:43.926
So it's all very important
for not just industrializing

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.761
and being able to meet people's needs,

00:12:45.785 --> 00:12:48.706
but also making sure
that the environment is taken care of.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:50.881
We're also really interested in culture.

00:12:50.905 --> 00:12:54.287
We have lots of discussions in our space
around who we were as Africans,

00:12:54.311 --> 00:12:56.223
who we are today, and who we want to be

00:12:56.247 --> 00:13:00.262
vis-à-vis things like consumerism
and ethnicity and corruption and so on.

00:13:00.745 --> 00:13:04.564
So we see ourselves as providing,
adding value to people

00:13:04.588 --> 00:13:08.191
by teaching them to add value
to things or materials

00:13:08.215 --> 00:13:10.366
so that they can build things that matter.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.249
Thank you very much for your attention.

00:13:12.273 --> 00:13:15.184
(Applause)

00:13:15.208 --> 00:13:16.359
Thank you.

00:13:16.383 --> 00:13:18.674
(Applause)
