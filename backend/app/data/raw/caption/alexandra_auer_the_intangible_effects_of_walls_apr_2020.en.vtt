00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:16.103
Humankind loves to build walls.

00:00:16.555 --> 00:00:18.146
Have you ever noticed that?

00:00:18.523 --> 00:00:20.732
We build walls for everything:

00:00:20.756 --> 00:00:24.494
for shelter, for protection, for privacy.

00:00:24.923 --> 00:00:27.148
Over the past 70 years,

00:00:27.172 --> 00:00:30.731
the number of barriers
between countries has doubled.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.407
Right now, there are more walls
than at the end of the Second World War,

00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:38.143
more than during the Cold War.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.239
Growing up in Germany,

00:00:40.263 --> 00:00:42.671
the fall of the Berlin Wall
always felt to me

00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:46.935
like the introduction of a new world,
a world without barriers.

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:49.144
But since the attacks of 9/11,

00:00:49.168 --> 00:00:52.268
the construction has experienced
an extreme rise.

00:00:52.672 --> 00:00:54.799
Since then, the amount has doubled,

00:00:54.823 --> 00:00:58.460
with about 30 new structures
that were planned or built.

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:03.628
Walls and fences are often built
with the intention of security,

00:01:03.652 --> 00:01:05.998
security from another group of people,

00:01:06.022 --> 00:01:08.336
from crime, from illegal trades.

00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:12.948
But walls and fences only provide us
with a feeling of security,

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:15.700
which is different from real security.

00:01:16.126 --> 00:01:18.587
Even though they might make us feel safe,

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:21.596
the structures themselves
can't protect us.

00:01:22.228 --> 00:01:24.740
Instead, they do something else:

00:01:24.764 --> 00:01:26.180
they separate.

00:01:26.204 --> 00:01:28.647
They create an us and a them.

00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:30.556
They establish an enemy.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.816
Walls make us build a second wall
in our head, a mental wall.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.567
And those mental walls
slowly make us lose sight

00:01:39.591 --> 00:01:43.563
of all the things we have in common
with the people on the other side.

00:01:44.363 --> 00:01:45.529
The other way around,

00:01:45.553 --> 00:01:49.448
mental walls can grow so strong
that they encourage us to build,

00:01:49.472 --> 00:01:52.222
keep or strengthen physical walls.

00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:55.265
Physical and mental walls
are closely interlinked,

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.818
and one almost always
comes with the other.

00:01:58.193 --> 00:01:59.628
It's a constant cycle:

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:03.912
physical walls empower mental walls,
and mental walls empower physical walls

00:02:03.936 --> 00:02:06.860
until at one point one part falls away,

00:02:06.884 --> 00:02:08.520
and the cycle is disrupted.

00:02:09.606 --> 00:02:11.818
When the Berlin Wall was being built,

00:02:11.842 --> 00:02:14.804
it was hard to tell
who the wall was facing,

00:02:14.828 --> 00:02:18.344
because the people living around it
identified as one.

00:02:18.368 --> 00:02:20.135
There was no us and them.

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.516
There was no others.

00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:23.607
During the time of separation,

00:02:23.631 --> 00:02:27.337
both sides developed differently
and formed individual identities.

00:02:27.736 --> 00:02:30.485
All of a sudden, there was
an us and a them.

00:02:30.898 --> 00:02:32.807
A mental wall was built,

00:02:32.831 --> 00:02:36.277
and when the Berlin Wall
fell again in 1989,

00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:39.455
this mental wall in the head
of the people stayed.

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:44.182
Eastern Germans had to be reintegrated
into their own country,

00:02:44.206 --> 00:02:46.930
and even though they didn't
have to move places,

00:02:46.954 --> 00:02:50.816
many still today feel like
they have never fully arrived.

00:02:51.182 --> 00:02:55.307
Those remaining effects
of the mental wall are also measurable.

00:02:55.735 --> 00:02:59.346
A study from the Freie University
of Berlin in 2005

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.539
shows that even 15 years
after the reunification,

00:03:03.563 --> 00:03:08.365
Germans still believed that cities
on the other side of the former wall

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.658
are further away than they really are.

00:03:11.237 --> 00:03:15.846
The interesting thing is that they found
a link between political attitude

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.884
and estimation of the distance.

00:03:18.477 --> 00:03:23.342
The more a participant was against
the German reunification,

00:03:23.366 --> 00:03:26.897
the further away
they estimated cities to be.

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:32.769
It's the mental wall which keeps
cities on the other side far away,

00:03:32.793 --> 00:03:35.739
and the higher and stronger
this mental wall,

00:03:35.763 --> 00:03:38.154
the more difficult
they seem to be reached.

00:03:38.777 --> 00:03:40.117
I tried to repeat this study

00:03:40.141 --> 00:03:43.109
with a group of young Germans
who grew up without the wall

00:03:43.133 --> 00:03:46.258
to see if these effects
are still measurable nowadays.

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:49.564
And the results show that this generation,

00:03:49.588 --> 00:03:51.070
my generation,

00:03:51.094 --> 00:03:55.320
is just kind of bad
at geography in general --

00:03:55.344 --> 00:03:56.414
(Laughter)

00:03:56.438 --> 00:03:57.632
East and West.

00:03:57.656 --> 00:04:01.378
But in our defense, this could be seen
as an improvement, right?

00:04:01.402 --> 00:04:03.978
We never experienced the actual wall.

00:04:04.002 --> 00:04:07.842
This physical barrier was never able
to make us build a mental wall

00:04:07.866 --> 00:04:09.114
in the first place.

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:13.060
I would love to take this
as a serious indication

00:04:13.084 --> 00:04:16.615
that there could be a future
without a mental wall dividing Germany,

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.845
but I think we have to face reality:

00:04:18.869 --> 00:04:20.923
this one wall could be disappearing,

00:04:20.947 --> 00:04:24.333
but in the meanwhile,
a billion others are constructed.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.638
One global trend
we are currently experiencing

00:04:27.662 --> 00:04:30.231
is the rise of gated communities.

00:04:30.914 --> 00:04:35.829
And in a way, gated communities can be
seen the same exact way as countries,

00:04:35.853 --> 00:04:37.854
just on the small scale --

00:04:37.878 --> 00:04:40.458
neighborhoods surrounded
by walls and fences

00:04:40.482 --> 00:04:43.722
to protect citizens from other citizens --

00:04:43.746 --> 00:04:47.091
and the only difference is,
it's by choice.

00:04:47.115 --> 00:04:50.556
But the physical and mental effects
on the people living inside

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.839
and the people kept outside

00:04:52.863 --> 00:04:54.148
are the same,

00:04:54.172 --> 00:04:57.132
separating cities, neighborhoods

00:04:57.156 --> 00:04:59.083
and even playgrounds.

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.609
In the spring of last year,
I worked on a design project in Brussels

00:05:03.633 --> 00:05:06.500
at two elementary schools
where this was the case.

00:05:07.071 --> 00:05:09.986
Both the schools share an entrance
and the schoolyard.

00:05:10.441 --> 00:05:12.170
Both schools teach in Dutch.

00:05:12.594 --> 00:05:15.582
But one school is mainly visited
by Belgian children,

00:05:15.606 --> 00:05:18.379
and the other school,
by immigrant children.

00:05:18.403 --> 00:05:20.839
The schools are separated
by walls and fences,

00:05:20.863 --> 00:05:23.503
leaving the children
no point of interaction

00:05:23.527 --> 00:05:27.295
other than this fence on the schoolyard
that separates them.

00:05:27.962 --> 00:05:29.367
When I started to work there,

00:05:29.391 --> 00:05:32.608
it made me sad to see children
having to stand at a fence

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:35.055
to talk to their friend on the other side.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.526
But what's even worse is that
most of the children

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.819
will never get the opportunity
to even make a friend on the other side.

00:05:43.827 --> 00:05:47.265
School should be the place
where children, all children,

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:48.960
come together and learn --

00:05:48.984 --> 00:05:51.575
learn from the teacher,
but more importantly,

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:52.851
learn from each other.

00:05:53.212 --> 00:05:56.309
And the more diversity,
the more there is to learn.

00:05:56.691 --> 00:05:59.648
In fact, school might be
the only time in our lives

00:05:59.672 --> 00:06:04.105
where establishing a contact despite
social differences is even possible.

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:07.826
Separating children during
this time of their development

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.999
will make integration extremely difficult,

00:06:11.023 --> 00:06:13.004
if not impossible.

00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:15.008
And yet, somehow,

00:06:15.032 --> 00:06:18.688
I seem to be the only one having
a problem with this fence in Brussels.

00:06:19.143 --> 00:06:21.576
Most of the parents, teachers and children

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.570
stopped seeing or at least
questioning the structure.

00:06:24.988 --> 00:06:26.297
It's just how it is.

00:06:26.321 --> 00:06:28.554
Nobody has ever seen it differently.

00:06:28.578 --> 00:06:30.979
And people are in favor of it.

00:06:31.957 --> 00:06:35.021
I once asked a boy if he would like
to play with the other side,

00:06:35.045 --> 00:06:36.292
and he said, "No."

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.817
Then I asked if he would play with them
if the fence wasn't there,

00:06:39.841 --> 00:06:41.707
and he said, "Probably."

00:06:41.731 --> 00:06:44.221
But then he quickly added
that the fence should stay,

00:06:44.245 --> 00:06:47.664
because the other side is mean
and they never give back his ball.

00:06:48.446 --> 00:06:51.129
It's funny, because I talked
to children from both sides,

00:06:51.153 --> 00:06:53.813
and everyone told me
that the other side is mean

00:06:53.837 --> 00:06:56.681
because they never give back the ball.

00:06:57.172 --> 00:06:59.409
The children on both sides
dislike each other,

00:06:59.433 --> 00:07:03.298
and there are regularly arguments
breaking out at this fence,

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:06.131
which is also the main reason
why people feel the need

00:07:06.155 --> 00:07:07.345
for it to be there:

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:09.346
it protects the children from each other,

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.542
or at least their toys,

00:07:10.566 --> 00:07:12.530
and it prevents chaos.

00:07:13.346 --> 00:07:16.493
At some point, the children started
to crawl beneath the fence

00:07:16.517 --> 00:07:17.802
to get their ball back,

00:07:17.826 --> 00:07:21.674
and the reaction of the schools
was to put these metal plates there.

00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:24.795
Now they climb over.

00:07:25.298 --> 00:07:27.373
I don't know what came first in Brussels:

00:07:27.397 --> 00:07:31.680
a mental wall that grew too strong
that it made them build a physical fence,

00:07:31.704 --> 00:07:35.285
or this fence that now emphasizes
the social differences,

00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:37.032
even on the schoolyard.

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:39.303
But what I did know
when I started to work there

00:07:39.327 --> 00:07:42.408
was that I wanted to change something
about the situation.

00:07:42.814 --> 00:07:46.795
I wanted to show both sides again
how much they have in common.

00:07:47.612 --> 00:07:49.875
For children, this isn't very hard,

00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:52.348
because even though
one schoolyard speaks Dutch

00:07:52.372 --> 00:07:56.259
and the other schoolyard, a mix
of French, Turkish and Arabic,

00:07:56.283 --> 00:07:59.100
they all speak the universal
language of play.

00:07:59.495 --> 00:08:02.051
And it turned out the desire to play

00:08:02.075 --> 00:08:05.750
is a lot stronger than all
the supposed differences between them.

00:08:06.178 --> 00:08:08.285
I installed different games at the fence,

00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:11.031
which turned it into an interface,
a common ground,

00:08:11.055 --> 00:08:12.478
instead of a barrier.

00:08:12.502 --> 00:08:15.397
And all of a sudden,
children were drawing together,

00:08:15.421 --> 00:08:16.900
exchanging pencils

00:08:16.924 --> 00:08:18.596
and talking on the phone.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:20.990
Especially the phones
were a great success,

00:08:21.014 --> 00:08:22.368
because they were so amazed

00:08:22.392 --> 00:08:25.468
by the fact that they can hear
the other side through this device

00:08:25.492 --> 00:08:27.459
that they couldn't stop speaking.

00:08:28.748 --> 00:08:32.472
In the case of an elementary school,
parents play a very big role

00:08:32.496 --> 00:08:36.278
in shaping the everyday life
and the environment of their children.

00:08:36.302 --> 00:08:38.601
So I knew that if I wanted
to make a difference,

00:08:38.625 --> 00:08:41.562
I had to somehow show them, too,
how much they have in common

00:08:41.586 --> 00:08:42.970
with the other side.

00:08:42.994 --> 00:08:45.362
But for parents, this was
a lot more difficult,

00:08:45.386 --> 00:08:47.894
because most of them
speak different languages,

00:08:47.918 --> 00:08:49.939
work different jobs
with different incomes,

00:08:49.963 --> 00:08:51.556
live in different social circles,

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.160
believe in different religions,

00:08:53.184 --> 00:08:54.598
experience different cultures

00:08:54.622 --> 00:08:56.476
and share different values.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.708
And then there was me,
a student,

00:08:58.732 --> 00:09:01.680
different in all of these aspects again.

00:09:02.095 --> 00:09:04.079
So how could I show them

00:09:04.103 --> 00:09:05.647
how much they have in common?

00:09:06.245 --> 00:09:08.500
I chose not to convince them myself

00:09:08.524 --> 00:09:11.243
but by letting their own
children do the talking.

00:09:11.679 --> 00:09:15.204
I designed a picture exhibition
on the schoolyard

00:09:15.228 --> 00:09:19.279
showing them their children
playing together through the fence.

00:09:19.303 --> 00:09:20.761
At the end of this exhibition,

00:09:20.785 --> 00:09:23.733
I asked people to write down
their thoughts, ideas and wishes

00:09:23.757 --> 00:09:25.091
on these big wooden boxes,

00:09:25.115 --> 00:09:27.869
and I labeled the boxes
with, "What do you think?"

00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:31.144
A lot of people wrote "Yes" on it.

00:09:31.874 --> 00:09:33.144
Yes, what?

00:09:33.838 --> 00:09:37.267
I never mentioned my opinion
or an action that should follow,

00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:39.931
so which question
were they answering with yes?

00:09:39.955 --> 00:09:42.759
When I asked, they said yes,
the fence should go.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.046
Yes, we want to play with the other side.

00:09:46.554 --> 00:09:49.336
The pictures implied enough
to answer a question

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.007
that was never proposed.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.479
People were seeing the absurdity
of the situation again

00:09:54.503 --> 00:09:56.865
and felt how unnecessary this fence is

00:09:56.889 --> 00:09:59.418
without me forcing an opinion on them.

00:10:00.735 --> 00:10:05.025
The exhibition showed the two sides
their similarities for once.

00:10:05.049 --> 00:10:07.387
That day, there was no us and them,

00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:08.862
there was no others.

00:10:09.648 --> 00:10:12.140
The mental wall started to crumble.

00:10:13.254 --> 00:10:14.909
I chose the word "crumbling,"

00:10:14.933 --> 00:10:18.133
because breaking a mental wall
is a long journey,

00:10:18.157 --> 00:10:21.211
and breaking a mental wall
can be a lot more difficult

00:10:21.235 --> 00:10:23.907
than simply tearing down the physical one.

00:10:23.931 --> 00:10:26.772
We have to challenge
our opinion and beliefs

00:10:26.796 --> 00:10:29.418
and maybe even admit our own wrongs.

00:10:30.012 --> 00:10:33.550
So what happened in Brussels
was a big step,

00:10:33.574 --> 00:10:37.664
a step that has been taking
generations in Germany.

00:10:38.863 --> 00:10:41.173
There are many examples
from all over the world

00:10:41.197 --> 00:10:45.471
telling the same story I experienced
in Brussels and Germany,

00:10:45.495 --> 00:10:48.336
enough examples from which
we could have learned.

00:10:49.016 --> 00:10:54.388
But still, we seek walls as solutions
for problems that they cannot solve,

00:10:54.412 --> 00:10:58.371
because walls don't fight
the root of our problem.

00:10:58.907 --> 00:11:01.662
If anything, they reduce the symptoms.

00:11:02.321 --> 00:11:05.994
So the next time you
are planning to build a wall

00:11:06.018 --> 00:11:10.199
or you are planning to support someone
who wants to build a wall,

00:11:10.223 --> 00:11:13.704
I want you to remember
the impact you are really having.

00:11:14.161 --> 00:11:18.276
Because, this simple structure
will hardly create more security.

00:11:18.729 --> 00:11:22.882
Instead, it will affect the people
living with it every day,

00:11:22.906 --> 00:11:25.981
people who, despite the geographic border,

00:11:26.005 --> 00:11:28.667
often share a lot of culture and values.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.665
For them, you are not building
one wall but two,

00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:39.063
two walls which will take decades
and generations to overcome again.

00:11:40.498 --> 00:11:41.658
Thank you.

00:11:41.682 --> 00:11:44.817
(Applause)
