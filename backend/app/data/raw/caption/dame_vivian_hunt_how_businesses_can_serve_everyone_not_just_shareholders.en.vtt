00:00:13.208 --> 00:00:15.601
Lately, a lot of chief executives

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:18.851
have promised to shift
their business model.

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:22.018
They pledge to serve all stakeholders,

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:24.184
not just shareholders.

00:00:24.208 --> 00:00:26.601
Investment return, they say,

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:28.643
will no longer take precedence

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:31.268
over the health and welfare of employees,

00:00:31.292 --> 00:00:32.601
suppliers,

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:34.351
even planet Earth.

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:36.268
Not just in a crisis,

00:00:36.292 --> 00:00:38.434
but every day.

00:00:38.458 --> 00:00:42.434
This is a change that business
absolutely needs to make,

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:44.833
but that does not mean
it is going to be easy.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.101
It's like going from being a young couple

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:49.851
to having kids.

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:51.684
When you're trying to make decisions

00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:54.268
with just one other person
in the relationship,

00:00:54.292 --> 00:00:55.976
it's pretty straightforward.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.059
Where should we have Sunday lunch?

00:00:58.083 --> 00:00:59.792
What should we watch for the movie?

00:01:00.625 --> 00:01:03.351
But when you add one child,

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:04.893
a second child,

00:01:04.917 --> 00:01:06.726
new decision makers,

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.393
life gets complicated.

00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:12.726
And each one has their own unique needs

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.018
and individual perspective.

00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:19.684
We all know that you're not supposed
to have a favorite child,

00:01:19.708 --> 00:01:23.500
and that being fair
doesn't always mean being equal.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.559
It's one of the biggest
challenges in parenting,

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:29.375
and in stakeholder capitalism.

00:01:30.458 --> 00:01:33.601
Employees need to earn a living wage.

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:37.809
How else can they be confident
that they can feed their families?

00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:41.893
Pension fund investors
need to earn a positive return.

00:01:41.917 --> 00:01:43.851
Only then can they be sure

00:01:43.875 --> 00:01:46.976
that they are managing
the savings and retirement

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.018
of their investors responsibly.

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:52.684
Consumers want and deserve
products and services

00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:55.750
that are both affordable and safe.

00:01:56.667 --> 00:01:59.726
And we all want a society and planet

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.083
that lets us breathe.

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:06.684
I have spent my career
helping companies and their leaders

00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:08.518
improve their performance,

00:02:08.542 --> 00:02:10.875
particularly at times of transition.

00:02:12.208 --> 00:02:14.476
We've all gone digital.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.184
We've responded
to new health care regulations.

00:02:17.208 --> 00:02:19.018
We've improved their productivity,

00:02:19.042 --> 00:02:21.851
made them more diverse and inclusive.

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:23.393
It took us a while to learn

00:02:23.417 --> 00:02:27.101
that you can't actually
make a company more digital

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:30.184
by appointing a chief digital officer,

00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:32.601
or that a chief diversity officer

00:02:32.625 --> 00:02:36.917
could not single-handedly
make a company's culture more inclusive.

00:02:37.792 --> 00:02:43.309
So we already know that we cannot
just appoint a chief stakeholder officer

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:46.518
if we really want to serve
all stakeholders.

00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:48.958
Instead, we need to reset.

00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:53.226
If we really want to serve
stakeholder needs,

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.958
we need to get everyone involved.

00:02:55.917 --> 00:02:57.809
There are no quick fixes,

00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:00.351
but I do have a few ideas.

00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:03.143
Let's start at the top: the boardroom.

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:06.976
This is where a company's strategy
is set and governed,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.226
and if all stakeholder needs
aren't accounted for here,

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.250
really, nothing's changing.

00:03:14.592 --> 00:03:18.268
By definition,
a board can stand in the way

00:03:18.292 --> 00:03:20.750
of serving all stakeholders.

00:03:21.583 --> 00:03:22.976
Why?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.292
Because often, a board
is elected by shareholders.

00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:29.268
It represents their interests.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:31.833
It's there to act on their behalf.

00:03:33.208 --> 00:03:35.292
That's not just a dictionary definition.

00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:38.518
It's enshrined in law in the US,

00:03:38.542 --> 00:03:40.226
and this can really limit

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.976
how much change a CEO or board can effect

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.934
if they want to serve the needs
of more stakeholders.

00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.393
For years, if we're honest,

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:52.643
we've been ticking boxes:

00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:55.583
ethnicity, age, gender.

00:03:56.417 --> 00:03:59.518
We've been looking for people
who look different,

00:03:59.542 --> 00:04:02.684
but boards still do the same thing.

00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:05.893
They look after the interests
of shareholders.

00:04:05.917 --> 00:04:07.768
We don't need tokens.

00:04:07.792 --> 00:04:12.268
We need people who truly
understand the experience

00:04:12.292 --> 00:04:16.143
and represent the diversity
of our stakeholders.

00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:20.018
Corporate boards can learn a thing or two
from the nonprofit world.

00:04:20.042 --> 00:04:23.018
I chair a charity, Teach First.

00:04:23.042 --> 00:04:26.393
It's an educational charity
that produces outstanding teachers

00:04:26.417 --> 00:04:27.893
and schools.

00:04:27.917 --> 00:04:31.250
Our board includes a wide range of skills:

00:04:32.667 --> 00:04:35.059
former civil servants,

00:04:35.083 --> 00:04:38.643
activists, teachers, ambassadors,

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:40.101
technologists.

00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:42.559
Some of them on paper have very little

00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:46.143
that's an obvious fit
for an educational charity.

00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:50.601
But they each have real experience
with our stakeholders.

00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:51.917
Every board is different.

00:04:52.917 --> 00:04:58.018
Imagine a world where corporate governance
was very different than today:

00:04:58.042 --> 00:05:02.184
community leaders sitting
on the boards of their local bank;

00:05:02.208 --> 00:05:06.393
moral philosophers
advising social media companies;

00:05:06.417 --> 00:05:11.268
environmental activists
as directors of global energy companies.

00:05:11.292 --> 00:05:13.851
CEOs keep making pledges.

00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:16.476
They keep talking about social purpose,

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.726
but real change won't happen

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.268
until we change who governs

00:05:21.292 --> 00:05:23.125
and for what purpose.

00:05:24.208 --> 00:05:27.684
We have to change the laws
of incorporation that limit us,

00:05:27.708 --> 00:05:30.125
and remember who we really serve.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.268
Next, let's talk about the big E,

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:36.059
the environment.

00:05:36.083 --> 00:05:40.643
Sustainability goals have been written
into annual reports all over the world.

00:05:40.667 --> 00:05:42.351
The goals are very lofty,

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:44.250
and very, very long-term,

00:05:45.167 --> 00:05:47.393
and none of them will be accomplished

00:05:47.417 --> 00:05:50.268
if they don't have
real steps along the way.

00:05:50.292 --> 00:05:51.684
It's like saying,

00:05:51.708 --> 00:05:55.750
"I'm going to run a marathon,
or a 5k, sometime in the future."

00:05:56.558 --> 00:06:00.559
No one is going to believe you
until they see you get off the couch,

00:06:00.583 --> 00:06:01.934
start training,

00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:04.792
putting in the miles every single day.

00:06:05.542 --> 00:06:08.184
CEOs need the same thing.

00:06:08.208 --> 00:06:12.393
They need concrete,
achievable, measurable goals,

00:06:12.417 --> 00:06:15.583
and they need to share the data
and progress along the way.

00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:20.809
Being green is good
for the bottom line in the long run,

00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:22.601
but it requires investments,

00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:24.417
and those have to be shared.

00:06:25.042 --> 00:06:29.518
Brazil-based Natura is the world's
fourth largest cosmetics company.

00:06:29.542 --> 00:06:32.018
They've got the usual
profit and loss statements

00:06:32.042 --> 00:06:34.184
for the investors and the executive,

00:06:34.208 --> 00:06:36.393
but it's their other two P and Ls

00:06:36.417 --> 00:06:38.976
that make them a little bit special.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.518
One measures how well
they do for the environment.

00:06:42.542 --> 00:06:46.393
The other looks
at their impact on society.

00:06:46.417 --> 00:06:48.059
They measure everything:

00:06:48.083 --> 00:06:49.768
seeds planted,

00:06:49.792 --> 00:06:51.643
jobs created,

00:06:51.667 --> 00:06:53.976
rubbish thrown in the bin.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.601
Shell, the Anglo-Dutch energy company,

00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:58.143
is another example.

00:06:58.167 --> 00:07:01.476
They figured out
what many of us already knew;

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.726
it's not good enough
just to look after your own emissions.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.976
In fact, their emissions
accounted for about 15 percent

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.976
of their system emissions.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.351
So they changed.

00:07:12.375 --> 00:07:15.809
Working with activists and pension funds,

00:07:15.833 --> 00:07:18.184
they set three-year rolling goals

00:07:18.208 --> 00:07:21.042
with progress markers year by year.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.184
By 2050, they hope to reduce
their net carbon footprint

00:07:26.208 --> 00:07:27.726
by almost two thirds.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.083
That is a major reduction.

00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:33.351
Initially, these targets
are linked to the bonuses

00:07:33.375 --> 00:07:35.833
of their top 150 decision makers,

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:42.851
and over time the pay
of nearly 17,000 employees

00:07:42.875 --> 00:07:46.708
could be linked in part
to how they treat Mother Earth.

00:07:48.542 --> 00:07:50.976
It's still early days for this industry

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.976
and many of these initiatives.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.768
Success will depend
on how well we stay the course

00:07:56.792 --> 00:07:59.226
when the investments
become more significant,

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.393
when stakeholders disagree,

00:08:01.417 --> 00:08:04.083
or when competitors start catching up.

00:08:05.542 --> 00:08:07.893
Let's spend a little bit of time
on a stakeholder

00:08:07.917 --> 00:08:09.601
who is sometimes hidden,

00:08:09.625 --> 00:08:11.893
and those are our suppliers.

00:08:11.917 --> 00:08:16.018
They are the connective tissue
underneath many companies:

00:08:16.042 --> 00:08:18.309
Uber drivers, widget makers,

00:08:18.333 --> 00:08:19.667
service employees.

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:24.309
They're like an invisible life force
that power our economy,

00:08:24.333 --> 00:08:26.643
and one thing we know for sure

00:08:26.667 --> 00:08:29.268
is that the success
or failure of your business

00:08:29.292 --> 00:08:31.851
depends on your suppliers
and partnerships.

00:08:31.875 --> 00:08:34.268
It's a painful lesson that many hospitals,

00:08:34.292 --> 00:08:36.101
including in the US and UK,

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:37.667
will take from COVID-19.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.059
In pandemics, robust, agile supply chains

00:08:42.083 --> 00:08:44.893
deliver the masks, ventilators,

00:08:44.917 --> 00:08:47.476
testing kits and vaccines

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.059
that we all need.

00:08:49.083 --> 00:08:50.851
It saves lives,

00:08:50.875 --> 00:08:53.750
and it helps to reopen our economy.

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:57.851
Suppliers don't just matter
when we're in a crisis.

00:08:57.875 --> 00:09:00.559
If you really want to scale
your positive impact,

00:09:00.583 --> 00:09:03.476
you have to look beyond
the walls of your company.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.809
BHP Billiton,

00:09:04.833 --> 00:09:06.559
the Australian mining company,

00:09:06.583 --> 00:09:08.768
did just that when it made a commitment

00:09:08.792 --> 00:09:13.143
to end gender imbalance
in its workforce by 2025.

00:09:13.167 --> 00:09:18.851
It decided to encourage, or kind of nudge,
its suppliers into also participating

00:09:18.875 --> 00:09:21.125
by providing training and technology.

00:09:21.875 --> 00:09:24.059
In Chile, Kal Tire

00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:26.643
helps to change the enormous tires

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:29.083
on BHP's trucks.

00:09:29.125 --> 00:09:32.559
It is a very physical,
demanding, dangerous job,

00:09:32.583 --> 00:09:33.976
and to be honest with you,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.750
not that many women
were even interested in the job.

00:09:37.583 --> 00:09:39.726
The two companies change that.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.059
First, they developed a mechanical arm.

00:09:42.083 --> 00:09:46.208
And then they proactively encouraged
women to apply for the job.

00:09:47.375 --> 00:09:50.833
Now, Kal Tire is just one company.

00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:53.309
It's an example.

00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:57.018
BHP Billiton has thousands of suppliers,

00:09:57.042 --> 00:10:00.351
and if you really want to engage
your supplier network,

00:10:00.375 --> 00:10:03.333
you can use incentives
to get them engaged.

00:10:04.125 --> 00:10:07.601
Today, Kal Tire illustrates

00:10:07.625 --> 00:10:10.018
how well that can be done,

00:10:10.042 --> 00:10:12.851
and across BHP's supplier networks,

00:10:12.875 --> 00:10:16.559
women are now 15 percent
more likely to get the job

00:10:16.583 --> 00:10:18.792
than they were even a year ago today.

00:10:20.083 --> 00:10:22.042
Suppliers and partnerships

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.393
will make or break your business.

00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:28.476
In good times, they're the key
to your success,

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.518
scaling it worldwide,

00:10:30.542 --> 00:10:33.833
and in bad times,
they're the key to your survival.

00:10:34.792 --> 00:10:37.351
If suppliers are a hidden stakeholder,

00:10:37.375 --> 00:10:39.792
then customers are probably
the most visible.

00:10:41.333 --> 00:10:43.809
But when shareholders rule supreme,

00:10:43.833 --> 00:10:46.018
some companies may have an incentive

00:10:46.042 --> 00:10:49.518
to focus on customers' short-term desires

00:10:49.542 --> 00:10:51.458
rather than their long-term needs.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.476
Consumption of processed food
has taken off around the world,

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.768
and with it,

00:10:57.792 --> 00:10:59.625
global obesity rates have increased.

00:11:01.292 --> 00:11:08.143
That's why the Access to Nutrition
Foundation now tracks the salt, fat, sugar

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:11.643
that global food and drink companies
include in their products.

00:11:11.667 --> 00:11:14.458
They also track whether
they market them responsibly.

00:11:15.458 --> 00:11:18.059
I think it's like measuring
the calories consumed

00:11:18.083 --> 00:11:20.208
for every dollar these companies earn.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.601
Companies that have been
paying attention to this

00:11:23.625 --> 00:11:25.351
have begun to make changes,

00:11:25.375 --> 00:11:28.143
including ingredients and formulations.

00:11:28.167 --> 00:11:31.809
Nestle reduced the sugar
in its breakfast cereal.

00:11:31.833 --> 00:11:36.726
Unilever reduced the volume
and calories in its ice cream.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.559
Now, I'm not sure that's a good idea,

00:11:39.583 --> 00:11:42.917
but I can tell you it takes creativity
and a little bit of investment.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:49.434
We know that consumer needs
change over time,

00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:52.518
but companies that make
these investments proactively

00:11:52.542 --> 00:11:57.018
can be better positioned
in the long term, even for shareholders.

00:11:57.042 --> 00:12:00.268
As we all have tried
to improve our eating habits,

00:12:00.292 --> 00:12:02.018
tried to eat less ice cream,

00:12:02.042 --> 00:12:05.309
these companies were well-positioned
to capture that market.

00:12:05.333 --> 00:12:07.726
They were ahead, more competitive,

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:10.601
and able to be more relevant.

00:12:10.625 --> 00:12:12.518
It also aligns with governments,

00:12:12.542 --> 00:12:15.101
many of whom have looked
at nutrition labeling,

00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:18.143
exercise programs, or even sugar taxes

00:12:18.167 --> 00:12:19.833
to encourage healthier eating.

00:12:20.917 --> 00:12:23.708
If customers are stakeholders,

00:12:25.417 --> 00:12:28.309
then they should not be harmed

00:12:28.333 --> 00:12:30.768
by the goods, services

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:33.059
and products we produce.

00:12:33.083 --> 00:12:34.500
It's that simple.

00:12:35.542 --> 00:12:39.184
For stakeholder capitalism to really work,

00:12:39.208 --> 00:12:42.667
we all need to see ourselves
as chief executive officers.

00:12:43.583 --> 00:12:45.643
If we really want change,

00:12:45.667 --> 00:12:47.167
we have to be willing

00:12:48.625 --> 00:12:50.518
to bear the backlash.

00:12:50.542 --> 00:12:52.458
We're not always going to get it right,

00:12:52.875 --> 00:12:54.125
and that's OK.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:58.417
Real, substantive change takes time.

00:12:59.292 --> 00:13:01.625
The right answer keeps changing.

00:13:02.917 --> 00:13:05.500
But we have to try to do better.

00:13:06.625 --> 00:13:09.018
There's a quote that I love
that really captures

00:13:09.042 --> 00:13:10.375
the essence of this moment.

00:13:11.208 --> 00:13:14.083
It's by the American poet
Gwendolyn Brooks.

00:13:15.167 --> 00:13:17.976
"We are each other's harvest.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.351
We are each other's business.

00:13:20.375 --> 00:13:23.792
We are each other's magnitude and bond."

00:13:25.417 --> 00:13:30.018
Business is a set
of ever-changing human bonds

00:13:30.042 --> 00:13:35.059
through which we plant and grow and reap.

00:13:35.083 --> 00:13:38.184
Our harvest is our lives and livelihoods,

00:13:38.208 --> 00:13:41.917
our civil liberties,
our skills and communities.

00:13:42.458 --> 00:13:44.792
Business is what we make of it.

00:13:45.875 --> 00:13:47.851
Let's hit reset

00:13:47.875 --> 00:13:49.708
and serve all stakeholders.

00:13:50.542 --> 00:13:52.417
Thank you.
