00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:08.485
For most of history,

00:00:08.485 --> 00:00:12.497
humans had no idea what purpose the heart served.

00:00:12.497 --> 00:00:16.380
In fact, the organ so confused Leonardo da Vinci,

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.721
that he gave up studying it.

00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:21.402
Although everyone could feel their own heart beating,

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:25.741
it wasn't always clear what each thump was achieving.

00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:28.558
Now we know that the heart pumps blood.

00:00:28.558 --> 00:00:30.916
But that fact wasn't always obvious,

00:00:30.916 --> 00:00:33.287
because if a heart was exposed or taken out,

00:00:33.287 --> 00:00:35.138
the body would perish quickly.

00:00:35.138 --> 00:00:38.249
It's also impossible to see through the blood vessels,

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:39.952
and even if that were possible,

00:00:39.952 --> 00:00:41.749
the blood itself is opaque,

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:44.900
making it difficult to see the heart valves working.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.930
Even in the 21st century,

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.227
only a few people in surgery teams

00:00:49.227 --> 00:00:52.034
have actually seen a working heart.

00:00:52.034 --> 00:00:54.012
Internet searches for heart function,

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:56.122
point to crude models, diagrams

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:59.674
or animations that don't really show how it works.

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.227
It's as if there has been a centuries old conspiracy

00:01:02.227 --> 00:01:04.015
amongst teachers and students

00:01:04.015 --> 00:01:07.376
to accept that heart function cannot be demonstrated.

00:01:07.376 --> 00:01:09.039
Meaning that the next best thing

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.268
is simply to cut it open and label the parts.

00:01:12.268 --> 00:01:15.343
That way students might not fully grasp the way it works,

00:01:15.343 --> 00:01:18.075
but can superficially understand it,

00:01:18.075 --> 00:01:19.863
learning such concepts as

00:01:19.863 --> 00:01:22.132
the heart is a four-chambered organ,

00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:24.350
or potentially misleading statements like,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.623
mammals have a dual-circulation:

00:01:26.623 --> 00:01:29.012
one with blood going to the lungs and back,

00:01:29.012 --> 00:01:31.110
and another to the body and back.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.555
In reality, mammals have a figure-eight circulation.

00:01:34.555 --> 00:01:37.213
Blood goes from one heart pump to the lungs,

00:01:37.213 --> 00:01:40.496
back to the second heart pump, which sends it to the body,

00:01:40.496 --> 00:01:42.463
and then back to the first pump.

00:01:42.463 --> 00:01:43.967
That's an important difference

00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:47.640
because it marks two completely different morphologies.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.520
This confusion makes many students

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.258
wary of the heart in biology lessons,

00:01:52.258 --> 00:01:54.873
thinking it signals an intimidating subject

00:01:54.873 --> 00:01:57.773
full of complicated names and diagrams.

00:01:57.773 --> 00:02:00.066
Only those who end up studying medicine

00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:03.335
compeltely understand how it all actually works.

00:02:03.335 --> 00:02:05.403
That's when its functions become apparent

00:02:05.403 --> 00:02:08.980
as medics get to observe the motion of the heart's valves.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:11.843
So, let's imagine you're a medic for a day.

00:02:11.843 --> 00:02:15.039
What you'll need to get started is a whole fresh heart,

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:17.468
like one from a sheep or pig.

00:02:17.468 --> 00:02:19.166
Immerse this heart in water

00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:22.462
and you'll see that it doesn't pump when squeezed by hand.

00:02:22.462 --> 00:02:25.426
That's because water doesn't enter the heart cleanly enough

00:02:25.426 --> 00:02:27.693
for the pumping mechanism to work.

00:02:27.693 --> 00:02:31.537
We can solve this problem in an extraordinarly simple way.

00:02:31.537 --> 00:02:35.119
Simply identify the two atria and cut them off,

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:38.099
trimming them down to the tops of the ventricles.

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.362
This makes the heart look less complicated

00:02:40.362 --> 00:02:43.989
because the atria have several incoming veins attached.

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.824
So without them there, the only vessels remaining

00:02:46.824 --> 00:02:48.943
are the two major heart arteries:

00:02:48.943 --> 00:02:51.326
the aorta and pulmonary artery,

00:02:51.326 --> 00:02:54.834
which rise like white columns from between the ventricles.

00:02:54.834 --> 00:02:57.753
It looks -- and really is -- very simple.

00:02:57.753 --> 00:03:01.217
If you run water into the right ventricle from a tap

00:03:01.217 --> 00:03:04.099
(the left also works, but less spectacularly),

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:05.992
you'll see that the ventricular valve

00:03:05.992 --> 00:03:09.061
tries to close against the incoming stream.

00:03:09.061 --> 00:03:11.480
And then ventricle inflates with water.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.891
Squeeze the ventricle and a stream of water

00:03:13.891 --> 00:03:16.245
squirts out of the pulmonary artery.

00:03:16.245 --> 00:03:19.744
The ventricular valves, called the tricuspid in the right ventricle

00:03:19.744 --> 00:03:21.677
and the mitral in the left,

00:03:21.677 --> 00:03:23.369
can be seen through the clear water

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.798
opening and closing like parachutes

00:03:25.798 --> 00:03:28.542
as the ventricle is rhythmically squeezed.

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:32.262
This flow of water mimics the flow of blood in life.

00:03:32.262 --> 00:03:34.290
The valves are completely efficient.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.081
You'll notice they don't leak at all when the ventricles are squeezed.

00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:40.868
Over time, they also close against each other

00:03:40.868 --> 00:03:42.769
with very little wear and tear,

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.009
which explains how this mechanism continues to work seamlessly

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:50.321
for more than 2 billion beats a heart gives in its lifetime.

00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:54.000
Now, anyone studying the heart can hold one in their hands,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.519
make it pump for real

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.446
and watch the action unfold.

00:03:57.446 --> 00:03:59.617
So place your hand above your own

00:03:59.617 --> 00:04:01.909
and feel its rhymic beat.

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:04.533
Understanding how this dependable inner pump works

00:04:04.533 --> 00:04:06.871
gives new resonance to the feeling you get

00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:08.061
when you run a race,

00:04:08.061 --> 00:04:09.454
drink too much caffeine

00:04:09.454 --> 00:04:11.831
or catch the eye of the one you love.
