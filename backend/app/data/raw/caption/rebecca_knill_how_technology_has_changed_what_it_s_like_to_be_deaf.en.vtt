00:00:13.028 --> 00:00:15.920
My name is Rebecca, and I'm a cyborg.

00:00:15.944 --> 00:00:18.968
(Laughter)

00:00:18.992 --> 00:00:23.206
Specifically, I have 32
computer chips inside my head,

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.495
which rebuild my sense of hearing.

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.871
This is called a cochlear implant.

00:00:28.805 --> 00:00:31.885
You remember the Borg from Star Trek,

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:36.004
those aliens who conquered and absorbed
everything in sight?

00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:38.139
Well, that's me.

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:39.805
(Laughter)

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.543
The good news is
I come for your technology

00:00:42.567 --> 00:00:44.703
and not for your human life-forms.

00:00:44.727 --> 00:00:46.884
(Laughter)

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:49.544
Actually, I've never seen
an episode of Star Trek.

00:00:49.568 --> 00:00:51.609
(Laughter)

00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:53.595
But there's a reason for that:

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:56.471
television wasn't closed-captioned
when I was a kid.

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.078
I grew up profoundly deaf.

00:00:59.102 --> 00:01:02.213
I went to regular schools,
and I had to lip-read.

00:01:02.237 --> 00:01:04.983
I didn't meet another
deaf person until I was 20.

00:01:06.135 --> 00:01:09.181
Electronics were mostly audio back then.

00:01:09.205 --> 00:01:11.701
My alarm clock was my sister Barbara,

00:01:11.725 --> 00:01:15.757
who would set her alarm
and then throw something at me to wake up.

00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:17.820
(Laughter)

00:01:18.317 --> 00:01:23.491
My hearing aids were industrial-strength,
sledgehammer volume,

00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:26.245
but they helped me more
than they helped most people.

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:29.555
With them, I could hear music
and the sound of my own voice.

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:35.607
I've always liked the idea that technology
can help make the world more human.

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:40.498
I used to watch the stereo flash color
when the music shifted,

00:01:40.522 --> 00:01:46.524
and I knew it was just a matter of time
before my watch could show me sound, too.

00:01:48.263 --> 00:01:50.943
Did you know that hearing
occurs in the brain?

00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:54.658
In your ear is a small organ
called the cochlea,

00:01:54.682 --> 00:01:59.789
and the cochlea is lined with thousands
of receptors called hair cells.

00:01:59.813 --> 00:02:02.242
When sound enters your ear,

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:06.758
those hair cells, they send
electric signals to your brain,

00:02:06.782 --> 00:02:09.662
and your brain then
interprets that as sound.

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:13.017
Hair-cell damage is really common:

00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:18.433
noise exposure, ordinary aging, illness.

00:02:18.457 --> 00:02:21.903
My hair cells were damaged
before I was even born.

00:02:21.927 --> 00:02:26.027
My mother was exposed to German measles
when she was pregnant with me.

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:31.083
About five percent of the world
has significant hearing loss.

00:02:31.107 --> 00:02:36.670
By 2050, that's expected to double
to over 900 million people,

00:02:36.694 --> 00:02:38.707
or one in 10.

00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:41.583
For seniors, it's already
one out of three.

00:02:42.966 --> 00:02:44.783
With a cochlear implant,

00:02:44.807 --> 00:02:47.759
computer chips do the job
for the damaged hair cells.

00:02:48.324 --> 00:02:51.661
Imagine a box of 16 crayons,

00:02:51.685 --> 00:02:55.168
and those 16 crayons, in combination,

00:02:55.192 --> 00:02:58.214
have to make all of the colors
in the universe.

00:02:58.731 --> 00:03:00.614
Same with the cochlear implant.

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:04.535
I have 16 electrodes
in each of my cochleas.

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:10.279
Those 16 electrodes, in combination,
send signals to my brain,

00:03:10.303 --> 00:03:14.669
representing all of the sounds
in the universe.

00:03:14.693 --> 00:03:18.641
I have electronics inside
and outside of my head

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:20.156
to make that happen,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.251
including a small processor,
magnets inside my skull

00:03:25.275 --> 00:03:27.883
and a rechargeable power source.

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:31.597
Radio waves transmit sound
through the magnets.

00:03:32.573 --> 00:03:36.200
The number one question that I get
about the cochlear implant

00:03:36.224 --> 00:03:38.464
when people hear about the magnets

00:03:38.488 --> 00:03:40.901
is whether my head sticks
to the refrigerator.

00:03:40.925 --> 00:03:47.216
(Laughter)

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.669
No, it does not.

00:03:48.693 --> 00:03:50.470
(Laughter)

00:03:50.494 --> 00:03:52.193
(Applause)

00:03:52.217 --> 00:03:54.382
Thank you, thank you.

00:03:54.406 --> 00:03:56.192
(Applause)

00:03:56.216 --> 00:03:57.828
I know this, because I tried.

00:03:57.852 --> 00:03:59.637
(Laughter)

00:04:00.105 --> 00:04:02.455
Hearing people assume that the Deaf

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:06.597
live in a perpetual state
of wanting to hear,

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:08.978
because they can't imagine any other way.

00:04:09.002 --> 00:04:11.453
But I've never once wished to be hearing.

00:04:11.477 --> 00:04:14.971
I just wanted to be part
of a community like me.

00:04:14.995 --> 00:04:16.779
I wanted everyone else to be deaf.

00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:22.864
I think that sense of belonging
is what ultimately connects our stories,

00:04:22.888 --> 00:04:24.501
and mine felt incomplete.

00:04:25.725 --> 00:04:28.248
When cochlear implants first got going,

00:04:28.272 --> 00:04:29.884
back in the '80s,

00:04:29.908 --> 00:04:34.233
the operation was
Frankenstein-monster scary.

00:04:35.185 --> 00:04:39.754
By 2001, the procedure
had evolved considerably,

00:04:39.778 --> 00:04:43.167
but it still wiped out
any natural hearing that you had.

00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:47.857
The success rate then
for speech comprehension was low,

00:04:47.881 --> 00:04:49.611
maybe 50 percent.

00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:52.882
So if it didn't work,
you couldn't go back.

00:04:53.935 --> 00:04:58.628
At that time, implants were also
controversial in the Deaf culture.

00:04:59.295 --> 00:05:02.048
Basically, it was considered
the equivalent

00:05:02.072 --> 00:05:04.165
of changing the color of your skin.

00:05:04.954 --> 00:05:06.814
I held off for a while,

00:05:06.838 --> 00:05:10.074
but my hearing was going downhill fast,

00:05:10.098 --> 00:05:12.757
and hearing aids were no longer helping.

00:05:12.781 --> 00:05:18.019
So in 2003, I made the tough decision
to have the cochlear implant.

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:24.324
I just needed to stop
that soul-sucking cycle of loss,

00:05:24.348 --> 00:05:26.986
regardless of whether
the operation worked,

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.452
and I really didn't think that it would.

00:05:29.476 --> 00:05:33.156
I saw it as one last box to check off

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.435
before I made the transition
to being completely deaf,

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:39.593
which a part of me wanted.

00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:44.331
Complete silence is very addictive.

00:05:45.824 --> 00:05:49.961
Maybe you've spent time
in a sensory deprivation tank,

00:05:49.985 --> 00:05:51.677
and you know what I mean.

00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:54.979
Silence has mind-expanding capabilities.

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.915
In silence, I see sound.

00:05:58.586 --> 00:06:01.296
When I watch a music video without sound,

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.868
I can hear music.

00:06:02.892 --> 00:06:04.956
In the absence of sound,

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.726
my brain fills in the gaps
based on the movement I see.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.219
My mind is no longer competing
with the distraction of sound.

00:06:14.243 --> 00:06:17.413
It's freed up to think more creatively.

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:23.459
There are advantages
to having bionic body parts as well.

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:26.412
It's undeniably convenient
to be able to hear,

00:06:26.436 --> 00:06:28.610
and I can turn it off any time I want.

00:06:28.634 --> 00:06:30.802
(Laughter)

00:06:30.826 --> 00:06:34.564
I'm hearing when I need to be,
and the rest of the time, I'm not.

00:06:34.588 --> 00:06:36.540
Bionic hearing doesn't age,

00:06:36.564 --> 00:06:40.161
although external parts
sometimes need replacement.

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:42.560
It would be so cool

00:06:42.584 --> 00:06:47.775
to just automatically regenerate
a damaged part like a real cyborg,

00:06:47.799 --> 00:06:50.529
but I get mine FedExed
from Advanced Bionics.

00:06:50.553 --> 00:06:51.933
(Laughter)

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.911
Oh, I get updates

00:06:55.935 --> 00:06:58.809
downloaded into my head.

00:06:58.833 --> 00:06:59.967
(Laughter)

00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:02.278
It's not quite AirDrop -- but close.

00:07:02.302 --> 00:07:04.197
(Laughter)

00:07:04.558 --> 00:07:05.837
With the cochlear implant,

00:07:05.861 --> 00:07:10.613
I can stream music from my iPod
into my head without earbuds.

00:07:11.336 --> 00:07:16.153
Recently, I went to a friend's
long, tedious concert ...

00:07:16.463 --> 00:07:18.327
(Laughter)

00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:20.842
and unknown to anyone else,

00:07:20.866 --> 00:07:23.732
I listened to the Beatles
for three hours instead.

00:07:23.756 --> 00:07:24.757
(Laughter)

00:07:24.781 --> 00:07:31.185
(Applause)

00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:35.113
Technology has come so far so fast.

00:07:35.137 --> 00:07:38.506
The biggest obstacle I face
as a deaf person

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.926
is no longer a physical barrier.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.824
It's the way that people respond
to my deafness,

00:07:44.848 --> 00:07:48.728
the outdated way
people respond to my deafness --

00:07:48.752 --> 00:07:52.432
pity, patronization, even anger --

00:07:52.456 --> 00:07:56.305
because that just cancels out
the human connection

00:07:56.329 --> 00:07:58.671
that technology achieves.

00:07:58.695 --> 00:08:03.639
I once had a travel roommate
who had a complete temper tantrum,

00:08:03.663 --> 00:08:05.832
because I didn't hear her
knocking on the door

00:08:05.856 --> 00:08:07.829
when her key didn't work.

00:08:07.853 --> 00:08:11.487
If I hadn't been there, no problem,
she could get another key,

00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:16.082
but when she saw that I was there,
her anger boiled over.

00:08:16.106 --> 00:08:18.483
It was no longer about a key.

00:08:18.507 --> 00:08:22.440
It was about deafness
not being a good enough reason

00:08:22.464 --> 00:08:24.169
for her inconvenience.

00:08:24.845 --> 00:08:27.081
Or the commercial about the deaf man

00:08:27.105 --> 00:08:30.861
whose neighborhood surprised him
with sign language messages

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:33.061
from people on the street.

00:08:33.085 --> 00:08:36.530
Everyone who sent me the video
told me they cried,

00:08:36.554 --> 00:08:37.872
so I asked them,

00:08:37.896 --> 00:08:39.522
"Well, what if he wasn't deaf?

00:08:39.546 --> 00:08:41.941
What if his first language was Spanish,

00:08:41.965 --> 00:08:44.393
and everyone learned Spanish instead?

00:08:44.417 --> 00:08:45.988
Would you have cried?"

00:08:46.012 --> 00:08:47.266
And they all said no.

00:08:48.065 --> 00:08:51.238
They weren't crying because
of the communication barrier,

00:08:51.262 --> 00:08:53.580
they were crying because the man was deaf.

00:08:54.421 --> 00:08:55.763
But I see it differently.

00:08:56.493 --> 00:09:00.990
What if the Borg showed up in that video,

00:09:01.014 --> 00:09:05.228
and the Borg said,
"Deafness is irrelevant."

00:09:05.252 --> 00:09:06.978
Because that's what they say, right?

00:09:07.002 --> 00:09:08.476
Everything's "irrelevant."

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.063
And then the Borg
assimilated the deaf guy --

00:09:12.087 --> 00:09:14.849
not out of pity, not out of anger,

00:09:14.873 --> 00:09:18.174
but because he had
a biological distinctiveness

00:09:18.198 --> 00:09:19.764
that the Borg wanted,

00:09:19.788 --> 00:09:22.936
including unique language capabilities.

00:09:23.599 --> 00:09:25.639
I would much rather see that commercial.

00:09:25.663 --> 00:09:26.813
(Laughter)

00:09:27.866 --> 00:09:31.527
Why does thinking about ability
make people so uncomfortable?

00:09:32.224 --> 00:09:35.108
You might know a play, later a movie,

00:09:35.132 --> 00:09:36.982
called "Children of a Lesser God,"

00:09:37.006 --> 00:09:38.846
by Mark Medoff.

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.579
That play, that title,

00:09:40.603 --> 00:09:44.065
actually comes from a poem
by Alfred Tennyson,

00:09:44.089 --> 00:09:47.732
and I interpret both the play and title

00:09:47.756 --> 00:09:52.773
to say that humans
who are perceived as defective

00:09:52.797 --> 00:09:54.665
were made by a lesser God

00:09:54.689 --> 00:09:56.891
and live an inferior existence,

00:09:56.915 --> 00:10:02.122
while those made by the real God
are a superior class,

00:10:02.146 --> 00:10:04.240
because God doesn't make mistakes.

00:10:05.496 --> 00:10:06.957
In World War II,

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:11.767
an estimated 275,000
people with disabilities

00:10:11.791 --> 00:10:14.780
were murdered in special death camps,

00:10:14.804 --> 00:10:19.331
because they didn't fit Hitler's vision
of a superior race.

00:10:19.355 --> 00:10:24.096
Hitler said that he was inspired
by the United States,

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:30.553
which had enacted involuntary
sterilization laws for "the unfit"

00:10:30.577 --> 00:10:32.540
in the early 1900s.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:38.657
That practice continued
in more than 30 states until the '70s,

00:10:38.681 --> 00:10:42.967
with the last law
finally repealed in 2003.

00:10:43.729 --> 00:10:47.673
So the world is not that far removed
from Tennyson's poem.

00:10:48.411 --> 00:10:53.054
That tendency to make assumptions
about people based on ability

00:10:53.078 --> 00:10:55.776
comes out in sentences like

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.712
"You're so special,"
"I couldn't live like that"

00:10:59.736 --> 00:11:02.585
or "Thank God that's not me."

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:08.295
Changing how people think
is like getting them to break a habit.

00:11:08.954 --> 00:11:13.200
Before the implant, I had stopped
using the voice telephone

00:11:13.224 --> 00:11:14.931
and switched to email,

00:11:14.955 --> 00:11:16.933
but people kept leaving me voice mail.

00:11:17.708 --> 00:11:20.518
They were upset
that I was unreachable by phone

00:11:20.542 --> 00:11:22.757
and not returning messages.

00:11:22.781 --> 00:11:26.224
I continued to tell them my situation.

00:11:26.248 --> 00:11:28.089
It took them months to adapt.

00:11:29.009 --> 00:11:31.209
Fast-forward 10 years,

00:11:31.233 --> 00:11:34.041
and you know who else hated voice mail?

00:11:34.612 --> 00:11:35.763
Millennials.

00:11:35.787 --> 00:11:38.310
(Laughter)

00:11:38.334 --> 00:11:39.660
And you know what they did?

00:11:40.596 --> 00:11:44.915
They normalized texting
for communication instead.

00:11:44.939 --> 00:11:48.424
Now, when it comes to ignoring voice mail,

00:11:48.448 --> 00:11:52.187
it no longer matters whether you're deaf
or just self-absorbed.

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:55.463
(Laughter)

00:11:55.487 --> 00:12:02.323
(Applause)

00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:06.107
Millennials changed
how people think about messaging.

00:12:06.131 --> 00:12:08.220
They reset the default.

00:12:08.778 --> 00:12:11.538
Can I just tell you
how much I love texting?

00:12:11.562 --> 00:12:13.284
Oh, and group texts.

00:12:14.049 --> 00:12:17.122
I have six siblings --

00:12:17.146 --> 00:12:18.903
they're all hearing,

00:12:18.927 --> 00:12:20.983
but I don't think any less of them.

00:12:21.007 --> 00:12:22.940
(Laughter)

00:12:22.964 --> 00:12:24.552
And we all text.

00:12:24.576 --> 00:12:26.144
Do you know how thrilling it is

00:12:26.168 --> 00:12:31.418
to have a visual means of communication
that everyone else actually uses?

00:12:31.886 --> 00:12:34.254
So I am on a mission now.

00:12:34.278 --> 00:12:37.163
As a consumer of technology,

00:12:37.187 --> 00:12:40.489
I want visual options
whenever there's audio.

00:12:40.513 --> 00:12:42.722
It doesn't matter whether I'm deaf

00:12:42.746 --> 00:12:44.523
or don't want to wake the baby.

00:12:44.547 --> 00:12:46.621
Both are equally valid.

00:12:46.985 --> 00:12:48.666
Smart designers

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:52.413
include multiple ways
to access technology,

00:12:52.437 --> 00:12:58.049
but segregating that access
under "accessibility" --

00:12:58.073 --> 00:13:01.587
that's just hiding it
from mainstream users.

00:13:01.611 --> 00:13:04.547
In order to change how people think,

00:13:04.571 --> 00:13:06.377
we need to be more than accessible,

00:13:06.401 --> 00:13:08.762
we need to be connected.

00:13:08.786 --> 00:13:10.990
Apple did this recently.

00:13:11.014 --> 00:13:15.268
On my iPhone, it automatically
displays a visual transcript

00:13:15.292 --> 00:13:16.602
of my voice mail,

00:13:16.626 --> 00:13:18.332
right next to the audio button.

00:13:18.356 --> 00:13:20.807
I couldn't turn it off
even if I wanted to.

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:22.782
You know what else?

00:13:22.806 --> 00:13:27.443
Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime no longer say

00:13:27.467 --> 00:13:29.839
"Closed-captioned
for the hearing impaired."

00:13:29.863 --> 00:13:33.292
They say "subtitles," "on" or "off,"

00:13:33.316 --> 00:13:36.894
with a list of languages
underneath, including English.

00:13:38.164 --> 00:13:40.822
Technology has come so far.

00:13:40.846 --> 00:13:43.343
Our mindset just needs to catch up.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.591
"Resistance is futile."

00:13:46.615 --> 00:13:48.107
(Laughter)

00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:49.734
You have been assimilated.

00:13:49.758 --> 00:13:51.781
(Laughter)

00:13:51.805 --> 00:13:52.956
Thank you.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:57.460
(Applause)
