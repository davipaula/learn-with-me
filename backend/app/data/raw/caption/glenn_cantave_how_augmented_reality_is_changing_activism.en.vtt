00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:14.518
My name is Glenn,

00:00:14.542 --> 00:00:16.059
I'm 25,

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:18.542
and I don't know my real last name.

00:00:19.542 --> 00:00:21.893
It's not uncommon in America.

00:00:21.917 --> 00:00:24.893
Most black people in this country
are walking around

00:00:24.917 --> 00:00:26.625
with a slave owner's last name.

00:00:27.458 --> 00:00:32.726
Black history has been systemically erased
and altered for centuries.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.018
As I give this talk,

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:38.768
there are more than 700 Confederate
monuments standing nationwide.

00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:41.559
These were erected
to honor Confederate soldiers

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:43.434
who fought to maintain slavery --

00:00:43.458 --> 00:00:44.768
mostly in the South --

00:00:44.792 --> 00:00:47.268
from the 1890s to the 1950s,

00:00:47.292 --> 00:00:51.792
when Jim Crow laws enforcing
racial segregation were in full effect.

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:57.226
To this day, black people are forced
to confront monuments of slaveholders

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.393
in our public spaces.

00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:02.893
These memorials are a physical
representation of a system

00:01:02.917 --> 00:01:06.643
that is actively working
to define whose lives matter

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:08.601
and whose lives do not.

00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:10.893
If we are going to disrupt the narrative,

00:01:10.917 --> 00:01:13.351
we have to start at the origin.

00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:18.268
Genocide, slavery and patriarchy
started in the Americas

00:01:18.292 --> 00:01:20.518
with Christopher Columbus.

00:01:20.542 --> 00:01:24.250
Most people in the United States
know about his voyage of 1492.

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:31.559
Fewer people know that an estimated
250,000 indigenous Arawaks were wiped out

00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:34.059
within two years of his arrival.

00:01:34.083 --> 00:01:35.393
Even fewer people know

00:01:35.417 --> 00:01:40.018
that Columbus admitted in a letter
written to Doña Juana de la Torre

00:01:40.042 --> 00:01:43.559
that "nine and 10-year-old girls
were in high demand,

00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:47.184
and for girls of all ages
a good price must be paid."

00:01:47.208 --> 00:01:52.018
Yet New York City's Columbus Circle
has had him perched 76 feet high

00:01:52.042 --> 00:01:54.833
next to Central Park since 1892.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.226
I started Movers and Shakers,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.518
a nonprofit,

00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:01.851
to get the statue removed.

00:02:01.875 --> 00:02:05.893
Movers and Shakers
is a group of activists, artists,

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:10.184
educators and engineers
focused on using immersive technology

00:02:10.208 --> 00:02:12.851
to highlight the narratives
of the oppressed.

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:15.851
In our campaign to knock
Columbus off his pedestal,

00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:19.375
we engaged in a visually
provocative form of activism.

00:02:20.208 --> 00:02:22.434
We created an augmented
reality installation

00:02:22.458 --> 00:02:25.059
on the true story of Christopher Columbus

00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:29.292
and used it to host teach-ins
in Columbus Circle and Times Square.

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:33.143
Many see the controversy around the statue

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:36.643
as tension between
the Italian-American community

00:02:36.667 --> 00:02:38.726
and the indigenous community.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.226
The reality is that most black people
are here in this country

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.143
as a result of the atrocities

00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:48.042
that were kicked off
by Christopher Columbus.

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:53.143
So we ended up holding
a slave auction in Union Square

00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:56.500
to tie into the genesis
of the transatlantic slave trade.

00:02:57.667 --> 00:03:02.500
I ran the New York City Marathon in chains
to spread awareness to this issue.

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:07.726
I was also arrested in Giants Stadium
for hosting a slave reenactment

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.875
at their football team's home opener.

00:03:11.833 --> 00:03:15.143
We gave it everything that we had,

00:03:15.167 --> 00:03:16.518
but in the end,

00:03:16.542 --> 00:03:19.101
New York City decided to keep the statue,

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:23.101
and New York State unanimously voted
to make it a landmark.

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:25.809
The news was devastating,

00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:27.851
but it opened up another door.

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:30.309
We realized that with augmented reality

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:32.643
you don't need permission
from the government

00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:36.018
to put up a monument
or to make a statement.

00:03:36.042 --> 00:03:37.851
You can just do it.

00:03:37.875 --> 00:03:39.184
So New York City right now

00:03:39.208 --> 00:03:43.643
currently has more than 150 statues
of men and six of women

00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:47.101
and currently acknowledges slaveholders
in public spaces as well.

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:50.018
So we decided, why not just put up
a bunch of AR monuments

00:03:50.042 --> 00:03:52.333
of women and people of color
throughout the city?

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.309
Typically, monuments are created

00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:58.684
to commemorate the achievements
of the deceased,

00:03:58.708 --> 00:04:01.708
but with augmented reality,
we can reroute the rules.

00:04:02.458 --> 00:04:04.434
We started with sports.

00:04:04.458 --> 00:04:06.059
Colin Kaepernick.

00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:09.434
He was the starting quarterback
of the San Francisco 49ers,

00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:11.059
and he wanted to use his platform

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:13.976
to highlight the injustice
of systemic racism.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.976
So he consulted a Green Beret
on the most respectful way to do this,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.309
and he decided to take a knee
during the national anthem.

00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:23.643
He lost his contract with the 49ers,

00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:26.434
he was blackballed by every NFL owner,

00:04:26.458 --> 00:04:28.684
he was criticized by millions

00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:30.767
and even the president
of the United States

00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:32.559
decided to insult him.

00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:39.226
It may be decades before Colin Kaepernick
is adequately respected for his courage,

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.292
so our team decided to do this.

00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:47.768
Now anyone that walks by Trump Tower
can see Colin Kaepernick take a knee

00:04:47.792 --> 00:04:49.351
in augmented reality,

00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:51.351
and there's nothing they can do about it.

00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:53.268
(Laughter)

00:04:53.292 --> 00:04:55.934
Representation matters.

00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:58.559
Serena Williams proved to the world

00:04:58.583 --> 00:05:01.559
that a black girl from Compton
can dominate a sport

00:05:01.583 --> 00:05:04.809
that's traditionally played
at exclusive country clubs.

00:05:04.833 --> 00:05:06.208
Let's celebrate her now.

00:05:07.208 --> 00:05:08.684
Jackie Robinson.

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:10.976
He broke the color barrier

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.476
and empowered many black athletes
to play in Major League Baseball.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.684
We're going to take this monument of him
and put it in Ebbets Field

00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:21.018
so that anyone can see him
swing for the fences

00:05:21.042 --> 00:05:22.417
in Ebbets Field in Brooklyn.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.143
With augmented reality,

00:05:25.167 --> 00:05:30.726
we have the power to tell stories
in public spaces that need to be told.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.893
The achievements of people
like Frida Kahlo, Audre Lorde,

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:36.726
Toussaint Louverture,

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.726
Madam C.J. Walker --

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.476
this should be common knowledge.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.208
Our vision is a "Pokémon Go"
for a contextualized history.

00:05:46.208 --> 00:05:50.768
Augmented reality can also be used
as a tool to support organizations

00:05:50.792 --> 00:05:54.101
that are fighting
against systemic oppression.

00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:56.893
In 2019 we will release
our free smartphone app

00:05:56.917 --> 00:05:59.559
with augmented reality
monuments and content.

00:05:59.583 --> 00:06:02.934
You can take your smartphone
and hold it over any one-dollar bill

00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.726
and see a scene in augmented reality

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.976
that illustrates
the injustice of cash bail.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.559
You can then click on the screen

00:06:09.583 --> 00:06:13.268
and be directed to the donation page
of The Bail Project,

00:06:13.292 --> 00:06:16.417
a fund that raises money for people
who cannot afford bail.

00:06:17.542 --> 00:06:19.018
With augmented reality,

00:06:19.042 --> 00:06:22.184
we the people have the power

00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:24.393
to highlight the narratives
of the oppressed

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:26.708
when institutions refuse to do so.

00:06:27.542 --> 00:06:31.893
We can use this tool
to highlight the systemic implications

00:06:31.917 --> 00:06:34.059
of erasing someone's history.

00:06:34.083 --> 00:06:35.809
And more concretely,

00:06:35.833 --> 00:06:39.268
we can use this technology
as a way to support initiatives

00:06:39.292 --> 00:06:41.750
that are fighting against systemic racism.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.143
With AR, we have the power
to reimagine a world

00:06:47.167 --> 00:06:50.768
that prioritizes justice over oppression.

00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:52.059
Thank you.

00:06:52.083 --> 00:06:56.250
(Applause and cheers)
