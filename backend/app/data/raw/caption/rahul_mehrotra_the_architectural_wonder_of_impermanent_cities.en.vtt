00:00:13.042 --> 00:00:15.559
On this planet today,

00:00:15.583 --> 00:00:21.351
there are about 50 cities
that are larger than five million people.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:24.059
I'm going to share with you
the story of one such city,

00:00:24.083 --> 00:00:26.476
a city of seven million people,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.559
but a city that's a temporary megacity,
an ephemeral megacity.

00:00:31.583 --> 00:00:36.643
This is a city that is built
for a Hindu religious festival

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:38.393
called Kumbh Mela,

00:00:38.417 --> 00:00:42.851
which occurs every 12 years,
in smaller editions every four years,

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:45.643
and takes place at the confluence

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:49.601
of the Ganges and
the Yamuna rivers in India.

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:52.018
And for this festival,

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:57.059
about 100 million people congregate.

00:00:57.083 --> 00:00:59.226
The reason so many people congregate here,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.309
is the Hindus believe
that during the festival,

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.809
the cycle every 12 years,

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:08.976
if you bathe at the confluence
of these two great rivers

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.268
you are freed from rebirth.

00:01:11.292 --> 00:01:12.934
It's a really compelling idea,

00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:15.559
you are liberated from life as we know it.

00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:19.351
And this is what attracts these millions.

00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:23.018
And an entire megacity
is built to house them.

00:01:23.042 --> 00:01:26.059
Seven million people
live there for the 55 days,

00:01:26.083 --> 00:01:29.351
and the other 100 million visit.

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:31.476
These are images from the same spot

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.018
that we took over the 10 weeks

00:01:34.042 --> 00:01:37.101
that it takes for the city to emerge.

00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:38.809
After the monsoon,

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:42.143
as the waters of these rivers
begin to recede

00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:44.809
and the sand banks expose themselves,

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:47.893
it becomes the terrain for the city.

00:01:47.917 --> 00:01:49.559
And by the 15th of January,

00:01:49.583 --> 00:01:52.434
starting 15th of October
to 15th of January,

00:01:52.458 --> 00:01:55.809
in these weeks an entire city emerges.

00:01:55.833 --> 00:01:59.333
A city that houses seven million people.

00:02:00.208 --> 00:02:03.643
What is fascinating is this city

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:08.226
actually has all the characteristics
of a real megacity:

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.893
a grid is employed to lay the city out.

00:02:10.917 --> 00:02:12.976
The urban system is a grid

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.018
and every street on this city

00:02:16.042 --> 00:02:19.101
goes across the river on a pontoon bridge.

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:20.643
Incredibly resilient,

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:25.726
because if there's an unseasonal downpour
or if the river changes course,

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.559
the urban system stays intact,

00:02:27.583 --> 00:02:32.083
the city adjusts itself to this terrain
which can be volatile.

00:02:33.792 --> 00:02:39.768
It also replicates all forms of physical,
as well as social, infrastructure.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:42.684
Water supply, sewage, electricity,

00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:48.101
there are 1,400 CCTV cameras
that are used for security

00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:51.976
by an entire station that is set up.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.434
But also social infrastructure,

00:02:54.458 --> 00:02:57.143
like clinics, hospitals,

00:02:57.167 --> 00:02:59.393
all sorts of community services,

00:02:59.417 --> 00:03:03.893
that make this function
like any real megacity would do.

00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:10.018
10,500 sweepers
are employed by the city.

00:03:10.042 --> 00:03:12.393
It has a governance system,
a Mela Adhikari,

00:03:12.417 --> 00:03:14.518
or the commissioner of the festival,

00:03:14.542 --> 00:03:16.934
that ensures that land is allocated,

00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:18.601
there are systems for all of this,

00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:23.000
that the system of the city, the mobility,
all works efficiently.

00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:28.934
You know, it was the cleanest
and the most efficient Indian city

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:30.226
I've lived in.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.625
(Laughter)

00:03:33.583 --> 00:03:36.434
And that's what it looks like
in comparison to Manhattan,

00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:38.476
30 square kilometers,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.434
that's the scale of the city.

00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:45.434
And this is not an informal city
or a pop-up city.

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:48.809
This is a formal city,
this is a state enterprise,

00:03:48.833 --> 00:03:51.351
the government sets this up.

00:03:51.375 --> 00:03:54.893
In today's world
of neoliberalism and capitalism,

00:03:54.917 --> 00:03:58.893
where the state has devolved itself
complete responsibility

00:03:58.917 --> 00:04:01.684
from making and designing cities,

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:03.018
this is an incredible case.

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:06.542
It's a deliberate,
intentional city, a formal city.

00:04:07.708 --> 00:04:11.768
And it's a city that sits
on the ground very lightly.

00:04:11.792 --> 00:04:14.643
It sits on the banks of these rivers.

00:04:14.667 --> 00:04:17.643
And it leaves very little mark.

00:04:17.667 --> 00:04:19.434
There are no foundations;

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:22.542
fabric is used to build this entire city.

00:04:23.458 --> 00:04:26.809
What's also quite incredible

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:31.434
is that there are five materials
that are used to build this settlement

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:33.392
for seven million people:

00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:36.518
eight-foot tall bamboo, string or rope,

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:39.143
nails or screw and a skinning material.

00:04:39.167 --> 00:04:42.893
Could be corrugated metal,
a fabric or plastic.

00:04:42.917 --> 00:04:46.559
And these materials
come together and aggregate.

00:04:46.583 --> 00:04:48.351
It's like a kit of parts.

00:04:48.375 --> 00:04:51.934
And it's used all the way
from a small tent,

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.976
which might house
five or six people, or a family,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.851
to temples that can house 500,
sometimes 1,000 people.

00:04:58.875 --> 00:05:02.643
And this kit of parts,
and this imagination of the city,

00:05:02.667 --> 00:05:05.809
allows it to be disassembled.

00:05:05.833 --> 00:05:08.434
And so at the end
of the festival, within a week,

00:05:08.458 --> 00:05:10.601
the entire city is disassembled.

00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:13.184
These are again images from the same spot.

00:05:13.208 --> 00:05:15.976
And the terrain
is offered back to the river,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.059
as with the monsoon
the water swells again.

00:05:19.083 --> 00:05:21.601
And it's this sort of imagination
as a kit of parts

00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:23.351
that allows this disassembly

00:05:23.375 --> 00:05:25.851
and the reabsorption of all this material.

00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:29.809
So the electricity poles
go to little villages in the hinterland,

00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:32.268
the pontoon bridges
are used in small towns,

00:05:32.292 --> 00:05:34.643
the material is all reabsorbed.

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:36.625
Fascinating, it's amazing.

00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:41.726
Now, you may embrace
these Hindu beliefs or not.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.351
But you know, this is a stunning example,

00:05:44.375 --> 00:05:46.601
and it's worthy of reflection.

00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:52.684
Here, human beings spend an enormous
amount of energy and imagination

00:05:52.708 --> 00:05:54.934
knowing that the city is going to reverse,

00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.601
it's going to be disassembled,

00:05:56.625 --> 00:05:58.809
it's going to disappear,

00:05:58.833 --> 00:06:01.208
it's the ephemeral megacity.

00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:04.976
And it has profound lessons to teach us.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.851
Lessons about how to touch
the ground lightly,

00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:10.351
about reversibility,

00:06:10.375 --> 00:06:11.875
about disassembly.

00:06:12.958 --> 00:06:14.208
Rather amazing.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:19.934
And you know, we are, as humans,
obsessed with permanence.

00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:22.083
We resist change.

00:06:23.042 --> 00:06:25.393
It's an impulse that we all have.

00:06:25.417 --> 00:06:28.268
And we resist change in spite of the fact

00:06:28.292 --> 00:06:31.851
that change is perhaps
the only constant in our lives.

00:06:31.875 --> 00:06:34.143
Everything has an expiry date,

00:06:34.167 --> 00:06:37.375
including Spaceship Earth, our planet.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.309
So what can we learn
from these sorts of settlements?

00:06:42.333 --> 00:06:44.684
Burning Man, of course much smaller,

00:06:44.708 --> 00:06:46.768
but reversible.

00:06:46.792 --> 00:06:49.768
Or the thousands of markets
for transaction,

00:06:49.792 --> 00:06:52.184
that appear around the globe

00:06:52.208 --> 00:06:55.643
in Asia, Latin America, Africa,
this one in Mexico,

00:06:55.667 --> 00:07:00.268
where the parking lots are animated
on the weekends, about 50,000 vendors,

00:07:00.292 --> 00:07:01.958
but on a temporal cycle.

00:07:02.792 --> 00:07:05.434
The farmer's market in the Americas:

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:09.476
it's an amazing phenomenon,
creates new chemistries,

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.684
extends the margin of space

00:07:11.708 --> 00:07:15.667
that is unused or not used optimally,
like parking lots, for example.

00:07:17.292 --> 00:07:18.768
In my own city of Mumbai,

00:07:18.792 --> 00:07:21.893
where I practice
as an architect and a planner,

00:07:21.917 --> 00:07:24.518
I see this in the everyday landscape.

00:07:24.542 --> 00:07:26.476
I call this the Kinetic City.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.726
It twitches like a live organism;
it's not static.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.559
It changes every day,

00:07:31.583 --> 00:07:34.184
on sometimes predictable cycles.

00:07:34.208 --> 00:07:35.851
About six million people

00:07:35.875 --> 00:07:39.351
live in these kinds
of temporary settlements.

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:42.518
Like -- unfortunately, like refugee camps,

00:07:42.542 --> 00:07:46.059
the slums of Mumbai,
the favelas of Latin America.

00:07:46.083 --> 00:07:49.809
Here, the temporary
is becoming the new permanent.

00:07:49.833 --> 00:07:54.143
Here, urbanism is not about grand vision,

00:07:54.167 --> 00:07:56.625
it's about grand adjustment.

00:07:57.625 --> 00:08:02.059
On the street in Mumbai,
during the Ganesh festival,

00:08:02.083 --> 00:08:03.601
a transformation.

00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:06.726
A community hall is created for 10 days.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.726
Bollywood films are shown,

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.059
thousands congregate
for dinners and celebration.

00:08:12.083 --> 00:08:15.143
It's made out of paper-mache
and plaster of Paris.

00:08:15.167 --> 00:08:17.143
Designed to be disassembled,

00:08:17.167 --> 00:08:20.184
and in 10 days, overnight, it disappears,

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:22.934
and the street goes back to anonymity.

00:08:22.958 --> 00:08:26.643
Or our wonderful open spaces,
we call them maidans.

00:08:26.667 --> 00:08:31.268
And it's used for this
incredibly nuanced and complicated,

00:08:31.292 --> 00:08:34.184
fascinating Indian game, called cricket,

00:08:34.208 --> 00:08:36.101
which, I believe, the British invented.

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:37.268
(Laughter)

00:08:37.292 --> 00:08:40.059
And in the evenings,

00:08:40.083 --> 00:08:42.101
a wedding wraps around
the cricket pitch --

00:08:42.125 --> 00:08:44.982
Notice, the cricket pitch
is not touched, it's sacred ground.

00:08:45.006 --> 00:08:46.351
(Laughter)

00:08:46.375 --> 00:08:49.893
But here, the club members
and the wedding party

00:08:49.917 --> 00:08:52.558
partake in tea through a common kitchen.

00:08:52.582 --> 00:08:55.518
And at midnight, it's disassembled,

00:08:55.542 --> 00:08:58.559
and the space offered back to the city.

00:08:58.583 --> 00:09:01.167
Here, urbanism is an elastic condition.

00:09:02.583 --> 00:09:05.851
And so, if we reflect
about these questions,

00:09:05.875 --> 00:09:08.393
I mean, I think many come to mind.

00:09:08.417 --> 00:09:10.893
But an important one is,

00:09:10.917 --> 00:09:12.643
are we really, in our cities,

00:09:12.667 --> 00:09:15.393
in our imagination about urbanism,

00:09:15.417 --> 00:09:19.934
making permanent solutions
for temporary problems?

00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.934
Are we locking resources into paradigms

00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:26.434
that we don't even know
will be relevant in a decade?

00:09:26.458 --> 00:09:27.726
This becomes, I think,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.351
an interesting question
that arises from this research.

00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:34.559
I mean, look at the abandoned
shopping malls in North America,

00:09:34.583 --> 00:09:36.018
suburban North America.

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:40.143
Retail experts have predicted
that in the next decade,

00:09:40.167 --> 00:09:43.018
of the 2,000 malls that exist today,

00:09:43.042 --> 00:09:45.309
50 percent will be abandoned.

00:09:45.333 --> 00:09:50.101
Massive amount of material,
capturing resources,

00:09:50.125 --> 00:09:52.542
that will not be relevant soon.

00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:55.143
Or the Olympic stadiums.

00:09:55.167 --> 00:09:57.809
Around the globe, cities build these

00:09:57.833 --> 00:10:01.018
under great contestation
with massive resources,

00:10:01.042 --> 00:10:03.018
but after the games go,

00:10:03.042 --> 00:10:05.476
they can't often
get absorbed into the city.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.934
Couldn't these be
nomadic structures, deflatable,

00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.768
we have the technology for that,

00:10:10.792 --> 00:10:15.143
that get gifted to smaller towns
around the world or in those countries,

00:10:15.167 --> 00:10:19.976
or are stored and moved
for the next Olympics?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.833
A massive, inefficient use of resources.

00:10:24.667 --> 00:10:25.976
Like the circus.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.101
I mean, we could imagine it
like the circus,

00:10:28.125 --> 00:10:30.976
this wonderful institution
that used to camp in cities,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.893
set up this lovely kind of visual dialogue
with the static city.

00:10:35.917 --> 00:10:38.601
And within it, the amazement.

00:10:38.625 --> 00:10:43.559
Children of different ethnic groups
become suddenly aware of each other,

00:10:43.583 --> 00:10:45.726
people of color become aware of others,

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:48.893
income groups and cultures and ethnicities

00:10:48.917 --> 00:10:54.393
all come together around the amazement
of the ring with animals and performers.

00:10:54.417 --> 00:10:57.684
New chemistries are created,
people become aware of things,

00:10:57.708 --> 00:11:00.768
and this moves on to the next town.

00:11:00.792 --> 00:11:04.351
Or nature, the fluxes of nature,
climate change,

00:11:04.375 --> 00:11:07.934
how do we deal with this,
can we be more accommodating?

00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:10.601
Can we create softer urban systems?

00:11:10.625 --> 00:11:13.226
Or are we going to challenge
nature continuously

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.851
with heavy infrastructure,

00:11:14.875 --> 00:11:17.667
which we are already doing,
unsuccessfully?

00:11:18.625 --> 00:11:20.101
Now, I'm not arguing

00:11:20.125 --> 00:11:22.559
that we've got to make
our cities like a circus,

00:11:22.583 --> 00:11:26.018
I'm not arguing that cities
must be completely temporary.

00:11:26.042 --> 00:11:27.643
I'm only making a plea

00:11:27.667 --> 00:11:30.684
that we need to make a shift
in our imagination about cities,

00:11:30.708 --> 00:11:33.726
where we need to reserve more space

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.684
for uses on a temporal scale.

00:11:36.708 --> 00:11:39.809
Where we need to use
our resources efficiently,

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:42.643
to extend the expiry date of our planet.

00:11:42.667 --> 00:11:45.768
We need to change planning
urban design cultures,

00:11:45.792 --> 00:11:48.601
to think of the temporal, the reversible,

00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:50.434
the disassembleable.

00:11:50.458 --> 00:11:52.601
And that can be tremendous

00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:56.083
in terms of the effect
it might have on our lives.

00:11:56.917 --> 00:11:59.851
I often think back to the Kumbh Mela

00:11:59.875 --> 00:12:02.018
that I visited with
my students and I studied,

00:12:02.042 --> 00:12:06.226
and this was a moment
where the city had been disassembled.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.101
A week after the festival was over.

00:12:08.125 --> 00:12:09.393
There was no mark.

00:12:09.417 --> 00:12:13.476
The terrain was waiting
to be covered over by the water,

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.768
to be consumed.

00:12:14.792 --> 00:12:17.559
And I went to thank a high priestess

00:12:17.583 --> 00:12:21.226
who had helped us and my students
through our research

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.851
and facilitated us through this process.

00:12:24.875 --> 00:12:27.143
And I went to her with great enthusiasm,

00:12:27.167 --> 00:12:29.268
and I told her about
how much we had learned

00:12:29.292 --> 00:12:32.893
about infrastructure, the city,
the efficiency of the city,

00:12:32.917 --> 00:12:36.018
the architecture, the five materials
that made the city.

00:12:36.042 --> 00:12:38.684
She looked really amused, she was smiling.

00:12:38.708 --> 00:12:41.518
In any case, she leaned forward

00:12:41.542 --> 00:12:44.893
and put her hand on my head to bless me.

00:12:44.917 --> 00:12:48.518
And she whispered in my ear, she said,

00:12:48.542 --> 00:12:51.601
"Feel blessed that the Mother Ganges

00:12:51.625 --> 00:12:56.292
allowed you all to sit in her lap
for a few days."

00:12:57.375 --> 00:12:59.684
I've often thought about this,

00:12:59.708 --> 00:13:02.601
and of course, I understood what she said.

00:13:02.625 --> 00:13:06.476
She said, cities, people,
architecture will come and go,

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.542
but the planet is here to stay.

00:13:09.625 --> 00:13:13.601
Touch it lightly, leave a minimal mark.

00:13:13.625 --> 00:13:18.059
And I think that's an important lesson
for us as citizens and architects.

00:13:18.083 --> 00:13:20.684
And I think it was this experience

00:13:20.708 --> 00:13:27.059
that made me believe that impermanence
is bigger than permanence

00:13:27.083 --> 00:13:28.351
and bigger than us all.

00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:29.893
Thank you for listening.

00:13:29.917 --> 00:13:36.000
(Applause)
