00:00:06.989 --> 00:00:10.242
You probably know that all stuff
is made up of atoms

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:11.424
and that an atom

00:00:11.448 --> 00:00:15.166
is a really, really, really,
really tiny particle.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.604
Every atom has a core,

00:00:16.628 --> 00:00:18.152
which is made up of at least one

00:00:18.176 --> 00:00:19.518
positively charged particle

00:00:19.542 --> 00:00:21.143
called a proton,

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:22.397
and in most cases,

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:25.568
some number of neutral
particles called neutrons.

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:26.942
That core is surrounded

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:30.148
by negatively charged
particles called electrons.

00:00:30.794 --> 00:00:32.613
The identity of an atom is determined

00:00:32.637 --> 00:00:36.898
only by the number
of protons in its nucleus.

00:00:36.922 --> 00:00:39.674
Hydrogen is hydrogen because it
has just one proton,

00:00:39.698 --> 00:00:41.413
carbon is carbon because it has six,

00:00:41.437 --> 00:00:43.399
gold is gold because it has 79,

00:00:43.423 --> 00:00:44.680
and so on.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.126
Indulge me in a momentary tangent.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.492
How do we know about atomic structure?

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:52.723
We can't see protons,
neutrons, or electrons.

00:00:53.814 --> 00:00:55.338
So, we do a bunch of experiments

00:00:55.362 --> 00:00:58.258
and develop a model
for what we think is there.

00:00:58.282 --> 00:00:59.806
Then we do some more experiments

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.592
and see if they agree with the model.

00:01:01.616 --> 00:01:02.813
If they do, great.

00:01:02.837 --> 00:01:05.678
If they don't, it might
be time for a new model.

00:01:05.702 --> 00:01:08.345
We've had lots of very
different models for atoms

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.486
since Democritus in 400 BC,

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.987
and there will almost certainly

00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:13.576
be many more to come.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.447
Okay, tangent over.

00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:18.208
The cores of atoms tend to stick together,

00:01:18.232 --> 00:01:19.993
but electrons are free to move,

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:22.771
and this is why chemists love electrons.

00:01:22.795 --> 00:01:24.209
If we could marry them,

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:25.637
we probably would.

00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:26.957
But electrons are weird.

00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:29.526
They appear to behave either as particles,

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.108
like little baseballs,

00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:33.298
or as waves, like water waves,

00:01:33.322 --> 00:01:36.499
depending on the experiment
that we perform.

00:01:36.523 --> 00:01:38.523
One of the weirdest things about electrons

00:01:38.547 --> 00:01:40.673
is that we can't exactly
say where they are.

00:01:40.697 --> 00:01:42.715
It's not that we don't have the equipment,

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:44.117
it's that this uncertainty

00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:46.474
is part of our model of the electron.

00:01:46.498 --> 00:01:49.036
So, we can't pinpoint them, fine.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.731
But we can say
there's a certain probability

00:01:51.755 --> 00:01:53.716
of finding an electron in a given space

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.681
around the nucleus.

00:01:55.705 --> 00:01:58.561
And that means that we can
ask the following question:

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:00.399
If we drew a shape around the nucleus

00:02:00.423 --> 00:02:02.463
such that we would be 95% sure

00:02:02.487 --> 00:02:05.496
of finding a given electron
within that shape,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.067
what would it look like?

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.797
Here are a few of these shapes.

00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:12.545
Chemists call them orbitals,

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.903
and what each one looks like

00:02:13.927 --> 00:02:15.844
depends on, among other things,

00:02:15.868 --> 00:02:17.691
how much energy it has.

00:02:17.715 --> 00:02:19.341
The more energy an orbital has,

00:02:19.365 --> 00:02:21.018
the farther most of its density is

00:02:21.042 --> 00:02:22.270
from the nucleus.

00:02:22.294 --> 00:02:25.251
By they way, why did we pick 95%

00:02:25.275 --> 00:02:26.887
and not 100%?

00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:28.191
Well, that's another quirk

00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:29.979
of our model of the electron.

00:02:30.003 --> 00:02:32.204
Past a certain distance from the nucleus,

00:02:32.228 --> 00:02:34.049
the probability of finding an electron

00:02:34.073 --> 00:02:35.600
starts to decrease

00:02:35.624 --> 00:02:37.912
more or less exponentially,

00:02:37.936 --> 00:02:40.131
which means that while it
will approach zero,

00:02:40.155 --> 00:02:42.582
it'll never actually hit zero.

00:02:43.124 --> 00:02:44.274
So, in every atom,

00:02:44.298 --> 00:02:47.414
there is some small,
but non-zero, probability

00:02:47.438 --> 00:02:50.525
that for a very, very
short period of time,

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:51.709
one of its electrons

00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:54.973
is at the other end of the known universe.

00:02:55.973 --> 00:02:58.693
But mostly electrons stay
close to their nucleus

00:02:58.717 --> 00:03:00.540
as clouds of negative charged density

00:03:00.564 --> 00:03:02.660
that shift and move with time.

00:03:02.684 --> 00:03:04.391
How electrons from one atom

00:03:04.415 --> 00:03:06.414
interact with electrons from another

00:03:06.438 --> 00:03:08.761
determines almost everything.

00:03:08.785 --> 00:03:10.547
Atoms can give up their electrons,

00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:12.216
surrendering them to other atoms,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.624
or they can share electrons.

00:03:15.202 --> 00:03:17.060
And the dynamics of this social network

00:03:17.084 --> 00:03:19.527
are what make chemistry interesting.

00:03:19.551 --> 00:03:20.791
From plain old rocks

00:03:20.815 --> 00:03:22.598
to the beautiful complexity of life,

00:03:22.622 --> 00:03:24.360
the nature of everything we see,

00:03:24.384 --> 00:03:25.896
hear,

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.113
smell, taste, touch, and even feel

00:03:28.137 --> 00:03:30.971
is determined at the atomic level.
