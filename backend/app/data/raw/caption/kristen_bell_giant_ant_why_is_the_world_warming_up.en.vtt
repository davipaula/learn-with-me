00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.613
Why is the world warming up?

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.093
Let's think of Earth
for just a moment as a greenhouse.

00:00:10.933 --> 00:00:15.593
Every second, a huge amount of energy
smashes into our greenhouse.

00:00:16.904 --> 00:00:20.466
Our atmosphere, the glass roof and walls,

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.512
reflects some of that energy,

00:00:22.536 --> 00:00:26.066
but most of it passes right through
and heats everything up.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.856
Much of that heat
used to escape back into space,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.556
keeping us at a stable, warm temperature.

00:00:33.614 --> 00:00:35.236
But then something changed.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.356
Humans began to spew enough carbon dioxide
to fill billions of greenhouses each day.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.516
What does all that greenhouse gas do?

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.423
It makes the glass
of our greenhouse thicker.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.416
Thicker glass means heat escapes
into space much more slowly.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.216
And don't forget, energy from the sun

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.246
is still streaming in
just as quickly as before.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.026
The result is a planet with temperatures
too hot for our liking

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.077
and, eventually...

00:01:03.607 --> 00:01:04.781
living.
