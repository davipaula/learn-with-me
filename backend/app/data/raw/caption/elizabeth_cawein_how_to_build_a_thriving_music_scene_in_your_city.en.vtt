00:00:12.877 --> 00:00:16.244
Each of these songs
represents a scene, a movement,

00:00:16.268 --> 00:00:18.739
in some cases, a sonic revolution

00:00:18.763 --> 00:00:22.500
that completely altered
the course of popular music.

00:00:22.524 --> 00:00:26.309
They're all also calling cards,
almost, for those cities,

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.975
songs totally linked
with their city's identity,

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:33.332
and it might be why you probably
consider them to be music cities.

00:00:33.827 --> 00:00:37.232
Now, the magical mythical thing,
the thing we kind of all love

00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:38.495
about stories like these

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.455
is that those cities weren't doing
anything in particular

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.360
to make those moments happen.

00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:48.051
There's no formula for capturing
lightning in a bottle.

00:00:48.828 --> 00:00:51.140
A formula didn't give us grunge music

00:00:51.164 --> 00:00:53.761
or introduce Tupac to Dr. Dre,

00:00:53.785 --> 00:00:57.825
and there's definitely no blueprint
for how to open your record business

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:59.366
in a South Memphis neighborhood

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.096
that, turns out,
is home to Booker T. Jones,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.722
William Bell and Albert King.

00:01:05.121 --> 00:01:08.017
So this is just something
that happens, then, right?

00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:10.953
When the stars perfectly align,

00:01:10.977 --> 00:01:13.437
great music just happens.

00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:15.993
And in the meantime,
New York and Nashville

00:01:16.017 --> 00:01:18.588
can churn out the hits
that come through our radios,

00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:19.843
define our generations

00:01:19.867 --> 00:01:22.296
and soundtrack our weddings
and our funerals

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.565
and everything in between.

00:01:25.057 --> 00:01:26.454
Well, I don't know about you,

00:01:26.478 --> 00:01:29.842
but the very idea of that
is just deadly boring to me.

00:01:30.697 --> 00:01:36.204
There are musicians all around you,
making powerful, important music,

00:01:36.228 --> 00:01:39.741
and thanks to the internet
and its limitless possibilities

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:41.721
for creators to create music

00:01:41.745 --> 00:01:44.125
and fans to discover that music,

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.116
those zeitgeist songs
don't have to be handed down to us

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.782
from some conference room
full of songwriters

00:01:50.806 --> 00:01:52.226
in a corporate high-rise.

00:01:53.411 --> 00:01:56.067
But also, and more importantly,

00:01:56.091 --> 00:01:59.298
we can't decide that it's just
something that happens,

00:01:59.322 --> 00:02:03.754
because music is about
so much more than hits,

00:02:03.778 --> 00:02:06.770
those big, iconic moments
that change everything.

00:02:07.415 --> 00:02:09.373
It's more than just entertainment.

00:02:09.944 --> 00:02:11.649
For so many of us,

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:14.966
music is truly a way to navigate life.

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.953
A means of self-expression, sure,

00:02:17.977 --> 00:02:22.721
but it also helps us find our self-worth
and figure out who we are.

00:02:22.745 --> 00:02:26.372
It connects us with other people
as almost nothing else can,

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:28.230
across language barriers,

00:02:28.254 --> 00:02:31.855
across social and cultural
and economic divides.

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.252
Music makes us smarter
and healthier and happier.

00:02:37.046 --> 00:02:39.069
Music is necessary.

00:02:40.338 --> 00:02:42.727
What if you lived in a city
that believed that,

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.401
that said, "We're not waiting
for that hit song to define us.

00:02:47.965 --> 00:02:51.742
We're a music city
because music is necessary."

00:02:53.142 --> 00:02:56.681
By seeing music as necessary,
a city can build two things:

00:02:57.547 --> 00:03:02.372
first, an ecosystem to support
the development of professional musicians

00:03:02.396 --> 00:03:03.984
and music business;

00:03:04.008 --> 00:03:08.325
and second, a receptive and engaged
audience to sustain them.

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:13.760
And those are the two critical
elements of a music city,

00:03:13.784 --> 00:03:17.704
a city whose leaders recognize
the importance of music

00:03:17.728 --> 00:03:20.046
for our development as individuals,

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.150
our connection as a community

00:03:22.174 --> 00:03:25.339
and our viability
as a vibrant place to live.

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.283
See, smart cities, music cities,

00:03:28.307 --> 00:03:33.045
know that thriving nightlife,
a creative class, culture

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.307
is what attracts young,
talented people to cities.

00:03:37.251 --> 00:03:38.997
It's what brings that lightning.

00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:45.281
And no, we can't predict
the next egg that will hatch,

00:03:45.305 --> 00:03:47.877
but we can create a city
that acts like an incubator.

00:03:48.652 --> 00:03:51.788
To do that, first,
we've got to know what we've got.

00:03:51.812 --> 00:03:54.980
That means identifying
and quantifying our assets.

00:03:55.004 --> 00:03:57.075
We need to know them backward and forward,

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.415
from who and what and where they are
to what their impact is on the economy.

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.570
Let's count our recording studios
and our record labels,

00:04:04.594 --> 00:04:07.698
our historic landmarks
and our hard-core punk clubs.

00:04:07.722 --> 00:04:11.794
We should count monthly free jazz nights
and weekly folk jams,

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:15.241
music schools, artist development,
instrument shops,

00:04:15.265 --> 00:04:17.375
every lathe and every luthier,

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:21.034
music museums open year round

00:04:21.058 --> 00:04:24.272
and music festivals
open just one weekend a year.

00:04:25.222 --> 00:04:28.602
Now, ideally through this process,
we'll create an actual asset map,

00:04:28.626 --> 00:04:30.422
dropping a pin for each one,

00:04:30.446 --> 00:04:33.257
allowing us to see exactly what we've got

00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:35.931
and where organic momentum
is already happening.

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:39.587
Because it's not enough
to paint in broad strokes here.

00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:42.873
When it comes to specific support
for music locally

00:04:42.897 --> 00:04:46.575
and a broad understanding
of a music brand nationally,

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.233
you've got to have the receipts.

00:04:49.178 --> 00:04:52.114
Next, we'll need
to identify our challenges.

00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:55.296
Now, it's important to know
that, for the most part,

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.630
this won't be just
the opposite of step one.

00:04:58.098 --> 00:04:59.361
We won't gain a whole lot

00:04:59.385 --> 00:05:02.193
by simply thinking
about what's missing from our map.

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:05.849
Instead, we need to approach this
more holistically.

00:05:06.531 --> 00:05:08.762
There are lots of music venues on our map.

00:05:08.786 --> 00:05:09.937
Awesome.

00:05:09.961 --> 00:05:11.890
But are they struggling?

00:05:11.914 --> 00:05:13.789
Do we have a venue ladder,

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:18.527
which just means, can an artist
starting out at a coffee house open mic

00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:20.797
see a clear path for how they'll grow

00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:24.317
from that 25-seat room
to a hundred-seat room and so on?

00:05:24.817 --> 00:05:28.126
Or are we expecting them to go
from a coffeehouse to a coliseum?

00:05:29.658 --> 00:05:32.562
Maybe our challenges lie
in city infrastructure:

00:05:32.586 --> 00:05:34.665
public transportation, affordable housing.

00:05:35.586 --> 00:05:37.157
Maybe, like in London,

00:05:37.181 --> 00:05:42.061
where the number of music venues
went from 400 in 2010

00:05:42.085 --> 00:05:44.499
to 100 in 2015,

00:05:44.523 --> 00:05:47.459
we need to think about
protections against gentrification.

00:05:48.244 --> 00:05:50.732
The mayor of London,
in December of last year,

00:05:50.756 --> 00:05:54.188
actually added something called
the "Agent of Change" principle

00:05:54.212 --> 00:05:56.195
to the city's comprehensive plan.

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:57.443
And the name says it all.

00:05:57.467 --> 00:06:00.590
If a real-estate developer
wants to build condos

00:06:00.614 --> 00:06:02.867
next to an existing music venue,

00:06:02.891 --> 00:06:05.175
the developer is the agent of change.

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.287
They have to take the necessary steps
for noise mitigation.

00:06:09.096 --> 00:06:11.120
Next, and this is a very big one,

00:06:11.144 --> 00:06:13.866
we need leadership,
and we need a strategy.

00:06:14.531 --> 00:06:17.343
Now we know there's a lot
of magic in this mix:

00:06:17.367 --> 00:06:20.144
a lot of right people,
right place, right time.

00:06:20.168 --> 00:06:22.748
And that will never stop being
an important element

00:06:22.772 --> 00:06:24.743
of the way music is made,

00:06:24.767 --> 00:06:28.552
the way some of the best,
most enduring music is made.

00:06:28.973 --> 00:06:31.515
But there cannot be a leadership vacuum.

00:06:32.142 --> 00:06:35.658
In 2018, thriving music cities
don't often happen

00:06:35.682 --> 00:06:37.776
and don't have to happen accidentally.

00:06:38.904 --> 00:06:43.648
We need elected officials
who recognize the power of music

00:06:43.672 --> 00:06:45.863
and elevate the voices of creatives,

00:06:45.887 --> 00:06:48.363
and they're ready to put
a strategy in place.

00:06:48.387 --> 00:06:51.500
In music cities,
from Berlin to Paris to BogotÃ¡,

00:06:51.524 --> 00:06:53.213
music advisory councils

00:06:53.237 --> 00:06:56.835
ensure that musicians
have a seat at the table.

00:06:56.859 --> 00:06:58.162
They're volunteer councils,

00:06:58.186 --> 00:07:00.670
and they work directly
with a designated advocate

00:07:00.694 --> 00:07:04.064
inside of city hall
or even the chamber of commerce.

00:07:04.627 --> 00:07:09.103
The strongest strategies will build music
community supports like this one inward

00:07:09.127 --> 00:07:11.071
while also exporting music outward.

00:07:11.628 --> 00:07:13.149
They go hand in hand.

00:07:13.173 --> 00:07:17.243
When we look inward, we create that place
that musicians want to live.

00:07:17.267 --> 00:07:18.687
And when we look outward,

00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:21.750
we build opportunities for them
to advance their career

00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:24.805
while also driving attention
back to our city

00:07:24.829 --> 00:07:27.434
and leveraging music
as a talent-attraction tool.

00:07:28.352 --> 00:07:30.820
And here's something else
that will help with that:

00:07:30.844 --> 00:07:32.859
we've got to figure out who we are.

00:07:33.662 --> 00:07:35.884
Now, when I say Austin,

00:07:35.908 --> 00:07:38.595
you probably think "live music capital."

00:07:38.619 --> 00:07:39.896
And why?

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.557
Because in 1991, leadership in Austin
saw something percolating

00:07:44.581 --> 00:07:47.993
with an existing asset,
and they chose to own it.

00:07:48.017 --> 00:07:51.542
By recognizing that momentum,
naming it and claiming it,

00:07:51.566 --> 00:07:54.895
they inevitably caused
more live music venues to open,

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:58.131
existing spaces to add
live music to their repertoire,

00:07:58.155 --> 00:08:01.839
and they created a swell
of civic buy-in around the idea,

00:08:01.863 --> 00:08:05.814
which meant that it wasn't just a slogan
in some tourism pamphlet.

00:08:05.838 --> 00:08:09.655
It was something that locals really
started to believe and take pride in.

00:08:10.893 --> 00:08:13.100
Now, generally speaking,
what Austin created

00:08:13.124 --> 00:08:16.147
is just an assets-based narrative.

00:08:16.171 --> 00:08:18.140
And when we think back to step one,

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:21.314
we know that every city
will not tick every box.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:25.374
Many cities won't have
recording studios like Memphis

00:08:25.398 --> 00:08:28.589
or a songwriter and publishing
scene like Nashville,

00:08:28.613 --> 00:08:30.158
and that's not a dealbreaker.

00:08:30.182 --> 00:08:33.903
We simply have to find the momentum
happening in our city.

00:08:33.927 --> 00:08:38.784
What are our unique assets
in comparison to no other place?

00:08:40.651 --> 00:08:45.246
So, if all of that sounds like something
you'd like to happen where you live,

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:48.472
here are three things you can do
to move the needle.

00:08:48.496 --> 00:08:52.313
First, you can use your feet,
your ears and your dollars.

00:08:52.337 --> 00:08:55.868
Show up. Be that receptive
and engaged audience

00:08:55.892 --> 00:08:59.114
that is so necessary
for a music city to thrive.

00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:00.550
Pay a cover charge.

00:09:00.574 --> 00:09:01.728
Buy a record.

00:09:01.752 --> 00:09:04.244
Discover new music,
and please, take your friends.

00:09:05.125 --> 00:09:07.267
Two, you can use your voice.

00:09:07.767 --> 00:09:10.632
Buy into the assets-based narrative.

00:09:10.656 --> 00:09:13.592
Talk about and celebrate
what your city has.

00:09:14.765 --> 00:09:16.772
And three, you can use your vote.

00:09:17.344 --> 00:09:21.066
Seek out leadership that doesn't
just pay lip service to your city's music,

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.683
but recognizes its power

00:09:22.707 --> 00:09:25.270
and is prepared to put a strategy in place

00:09:25.294 --> 00:09:28.001
to elevate it, grow it
and build collaboration.

00:09:29.697 --> 00:09:33.196
There really is no telling
what city could be defined

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.603
by a certain scene or a certain song
in the next decade,

00:09:37.627 --> 00:09:40.739
but as much as we absolutely
cannot predict that,

00:09:40.763 --> 00:09:43.019
what we absolutely can predict

00:09:43.043 --> 00:09:46.432
is what happens
when we treat music as necessary

00:09:46.456 --> 00:09:49.003
and we work to build a music city.

00:09:49.027 --> 00:09:51.265
And that is a place where I want to live.

00:09:51.963 --> 00:09:53.114
Thank you.

00:09:53.138 --> 00:09:56.103
(Applause)
