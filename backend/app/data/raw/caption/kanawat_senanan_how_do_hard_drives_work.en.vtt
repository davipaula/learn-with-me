00:00:07.248 --> 00:00:10.821
Imagine an airplane flying
one millimeter above the ground

00:00:10.821 --> 00:00:14.029
and circling the Earth
once every 25 seconds

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.335
while counting every blade of grass.

00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:20.551
Shrink all that down so that it fits
in the palm of your hand,

00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:24.305
and you'd have something equivalent
to a modern hard drive,

00:00:24.305 --> 00:00:28.455
an object that can likely hold
more information than your local library.

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:32.906
So how does it store so much information
in such a small space?

00:00:32.906 --> 00:00:37.122
At the heart of every hard drive
is a stack of high-speed spinning discs

00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:40.525
with a recording head 
flying over each surface.

00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:46.278
Each disc is coated with a film
of microscopic magnetised metal grains,

00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:49.591
and your data doesn't live there
in a form you can recognize.

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:52.768
Instead, it is recorded 
as a magnetic pattern

00:00:52.768 --> 00:00:55.819
formed by groups of those tiny grains.

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:58.169
In each group, also known as a bit,

00:00:58.169 --> 00:01:01.121
all of the grains have 
their magnetization's aligned

00:01:01.121 --> 00:01:03.596
in one of two possible states,

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:06.805
which correspond to zeroes and ones.

00:01:06.805 --> 00:01:08.668
Data is written onto the disc

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:12.577
by converting strings of bits 
into electrical current

00:01:12.577 --> 00:01:14.994
fed through an electromagnet.

00:01:14.994 --> 00:01:18.613
This magnet generates a field
strong enough to change the direction

00:01:18.613 --> 00:01:21.145
of the metal grain's magnetization.

00:01:21.145 --> 00:01:24.102
Once this information is written 
onto the disc,

00:01:24.102 --> 00:01:28.843
the drive uses a magnetic reader
to turn it back into a useful form,

00:01:28.843 --> 00:01:33.468
much like a phonograph needle
translates a record's grooves into music.

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:37.634
But how can you get so much information
out of just zeroes and ones?

00:01:37.634 --> 00:01:40.300
Well, by putting lots of them together.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.246
For example, a letter is represented
in one byte, or eight bits,

00:01:45.246 --> 00:01:47.879
and your average photo 
takes up several megabytes,

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:50.865
each of which is 8 million bits.

00:01:50.865 --> 00:01:54.779
Because each bit must be written onto
a physical area of the disc,

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:58.833
we're always seeking to increase
the disc's areal density,

00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:03.572
or how many bits can be squeezed
into one square inch.

00:02:03.572 --> 00:02:08.907
The areal density of a modern hard drive
is about 600 gigabits per square inch,

00:02:08.907 --> 00:02:15.524
300 million times greater than that
of IBM's first hard drive from 1957.

00:02:15.524 --> 00:02:17.929
This amazing advance in storage capacity

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:20.732
wasn't just a matter 
of making everything smaller,

00:02:20.732 --> 00:02:22.914
but involved multiple innovations.

00:02:22.914 --> 00:02:26.153
A technique called the thin film
lithography process

00:02:26.153 --> 00:02:29.847
allowed engineers 
to shrink the reader and writer.

00:02:29.847 --> 00:02:32.767
And despite its size, 
the reader became more sensitive

00:02:32.767 --> 00:02:39.090
by taking advantage of new discoveries in
magnetic and quantum properties of matter.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.384
Bits could also be packed closer together
thanks to mathematical algorithms

00:02:43.384 --> 00:02:46.600
that filter out noise
from magnetic interference,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.474
and find the most likely bit sequences
from each chunk of read-back signal.

00:02:51.474 --> 00:02:54.465
And thermal expansion control of the head,

00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:57.548
enabled by placing a heater 
under the magnetic writer,

00:02:57.548 --> 00:03:02.675
allowed it to fly less than
five nanometers above the disc's surface,

00:03:02.675 --> 00:03:06.661
about the width of two strands of DNA.

00:03:06.661 --> 00:03:08.417
For the past several decades,

00:03:08.417 --> 00:03:12.564
the exponential growth in computer
storage capacity and processing power

00:03:12.564 --> 00:03:15.816
has followed a pattern 
known as Moore's Law,

00:03:15.816 --> 00:03:23.099
which, in 1975, predicted that information
density would double every two years.

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.993
But at around 100 gigabits 
per square inch,

00:03:25.993 --> 00:03:30.185
shrinking the magnetic grains further
or cramming them closer together

00:03:30.185 --> 00:03:34.361
posed a new risk
called the superparamagnetic effect.

00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:37.545
When a magnetic grain volume is too small,

00:03:37.545 --> 00:03:41.476
its magnetization is easily disturbed
by heat energy

00:03:41.476 --> 00:03:44.429
and can cause bits 
to switch unintentionally,

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:46.714
leading to data loss.

00:03:46.714 --> 00:03:50.819
Scientists resolved this limitation
in a remarkably simple way:

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.899
by changing the direction of recording
from longitudinal to perpendicular,

00:03:55.899 --> 00:04:01.225
allowing areal density to approach
one terabit per square inch.

00:04:01.225 --> 00:04:04.858
Recently, the potential limit has been
increased yet again

00:04:04.858 --> 00:04:07.682
through heat assisted magnetic recording.

00:04:07.682 --> 00:04:11.451
This uses an even more thermally
stable recording medium,

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:14.889
whose magnetic resistance 
is momentarily reduced

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:18.517
by heating up a particular spot 
with a laser

00:04:18.517 --> 00:04:20.535
and allowing data to be written.

00:04:20.535 --> 00:04:23.557
And while those drives are currently
in the prototype stage,

00:04:23.557 --> 00:04:28.295
scientists already have the next potential
trick up their sleeves:

00:04:28.295 --> 00:04:30.291
bit-patterned media,

00:04:30.291 --> 00:04:35.267
where bit locations are arranged 
in separate, nano-sized structures,

00:04:35.267 --> 00:04:40.303
potentially allowing for areal densities
of twenty terabits per square inch

00:04:40.303 --> 00:04:41.780
or more.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.247
So it's thanks to the combined efforts
of generations of engineers,

00:04:46.247 --> 00:04:48.014
material scientists,

00:04:48.014 --> 00:04:49.976
and quantum physicists

00:04:49.976 --> 00:04:53.019
that this tool of incredible power
and precision

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:55.814
can spin in the palm of your hand.
