00:00:15.387 --> 00:00:19.003
The story I want to tell you about, started to me,

00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:23.155
in 1996 when I was studying in England.

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:27.319
One day, I was glancing through my bank statement
(I didn't have much to look at)

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:32.561
and I've noticed that in the upper corner there was
a symbol, that I'm going to show you,

00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:37.120
saying that document had been made in
plain language, for me to understand it.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.460
The idea interested me; I tried to find out
what that was

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.628
and I found out that there was a campaign for the
simplification of language,

00:00:43.628 --> 00:00:45.369
which was the "Plain English Campaign".

00:00:45.415 --> 00:00:48.340
I thought it was a fabulous idea, for about 
one day or two,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.079
and I've never thought about it since.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.615
When I came back to Portugal, for good,

00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:57.760
I came across with several documents - for example, 
my work contract,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.457
the papers I had to sign to buy a house, 
the electricity bill --

00:01:02.457 --> 00:01:05.858
a series of documents that reminded me of 
that bank statement.

00:01:05.858 --> 00:01:09.435
Not because they were equally clear and simple,

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:12.041
but because they were the exact opposite.

00:01:12.041 --> 00:01:16.835
Because I had to read everything twice or thrice, 
to begin to understand what was written there.

00:01:16.835 --> 00:01:23.691
And then, that little seed that had been sown
in 1996, started germinating.

00:01:23.753 --> 00:01:25.504
And one day, I found myself

00:01:25.504 --> 00:01:29.504
entering through my boss' office and quitting 
my job to dedicate myself to this.

00:01:29.504 --> 00:01:32.964
And so, what did I find out, right off the start?

00:01:32.964 --> 00:01:35.888
I found out that it was a much more severe problem 
than I thought.

00:01:35.888 --> 00:01:40.354
It wasn't only about these documents being 
complex and annoying,

00:01:40.354 --> 00:01:43.654
it was the fact that Portuguese people's literacy --

00:01:43.654 --> 00:01:46.489
literacy is the hability to understand written documents --

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:52.022
is extremely low. I'm going to show you a chart about Portuguese people's literacy [rate].

00:01:52.022 --> 00:01:55.603
You know that about 10, 11% of people, in Portugal,

00:01:55.603 --> 00:01:58.412
don't know how to read nor write at all, yet.

00:01:58.412 --> 00:02:02.627
Over there are those who know, or say they know, 
how to read and write. So, what do we have?

00:02:02.627 --> 00:02:07.987
We have that group of red people in level 1, 
which is the lowest in literacy [rate].

00:02:07.987 --> 00:02:11.311
They are persons who are able to join letters,

00:02:11.311 --> 00:02:13.859
but they can't, actually, understand.

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:17.546
For example, if a person, from that red group, 
has to pick up

00:02:17.546 --> 00:02:22.826
the package leaflet of a medicinal product, 
to give a dose of medicine to his/her child,

00:02:22.826 --> 00:02:25.295
he/she can't, can't understand the information.

00:02:25.295 --> 00:02:30.423
50% of the Portuguese. Then we have 30% more, 
those yellow ones,

00:02:30.423 --> 00:02:34.974
over there, people who get by
on the daily basis.

00:02:34.974 --> 00:02:38.348
That is, if they don't have to read anything too new 
or too different, they will manage.

00:02:38.348 --> 00:02:42.048
But, for example, if they work in a factory and 
a new machine arrives

00:02:42.048 --> 00:02:46.946
and they have to read the machine's manual 
to be able to work with it, they can't do it anymore.

00:02:46.946 --> 00:02:51.398
And there they go, 80% of the Portuguese people.

00:02:51.398 --> 00:02:54.014
Then we have a few more that can handle documents,

00:02:54.014 --> 00:02:55.441
as long as they are not too complex,

00:02:55.441 --> 00:03:00.880
and we have 5% of the population that 
can handle really complex documents.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.917
Now, just so you don't think this is normal, 
that over there is Sweden.

00:03:05.917 --> 00:03:11.266
While we have 20% of people with the literacy 
considered essential for a daily basis,

00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:14.783
Sweden has 75%.

00:03:14.783 --> 00:03:16.891
And looking at that, what did I realize?

00:03:16.891 --> 00:03:20.226
I realized we live in an apartheid of information.

00:03:20.226 --> 00:03:25.977
I realized that there's a small minority of people 
who has indeed access to information

00:03:25.977 --> 00:03:31.371
and can use it to their advantage and 
a huge majority that can't.

00:03:31.371 --> 00:03:35.177
And because they can't, they are excluded 
and they are impaired.

00:03:35.177 --> 00:03:37.193
Let me give you an example.

00:03:37.193 --> 00:03:42.560
That one is Mr. Domingos, my building's doorkeeper. Mr. Domingos started to read at the age of 27,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.608
so, he falls in that yellow group that 
we have seen a little while ago.

00:03:45.608 --> 00:03:47.561
From time to time, I'm arriving home and he says:

00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:49.692
"Miss Sandra!"; "Yes, Mr. Domingos."

00:03:49.692 --> 00:03:54.211
"Here is a little letter." So, the deal is: when Mr. Domingos or someone in the family or in the neighbourhood

00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:57.906
receives something that they don't understand, 
they come to me and I help them to translate it.

00:03:57.906 --> 00:03:59.516
And so, that time he said to me like this:

00:03:59.516 --> 00:04:03.241
"Oh, Miss Sandra, I'm about to throw this away, 
but check it if this is important."

00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:08.067
It was very important. He had been waiting, 
for quite a while, to have a knee surgery

00:04:08.067 --> 00:04:11.927
and that was the letter of the famous surgery-bank
checks. When a person is waiting for a long time,

00:04:11.927 --> 00:04:15.618
they get a bank check and with that bank check 
they can have that surgery in the private sector.

00:04:15.618 --> 00:04:18.654
It was almost thrown away into the garbage, 
Mr. Domingos' letter.

00:04:18.654 --> 00:04:20.805
In that same year, I've found out,

00:04:20.805 --> 00:04:24.399
only 20% of people had used these 
surgery-bank checks.

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:30.486
The other 80%, I don't believe they had been cured
while they were waiting.

00:04:30.486 --> 00:04:33.522
They most likely did the same as Mr. Domingos:

00:04:33.522 --> 00:04:35.817
"Ah! What's this? I'm not understanding, 
it's going to the garbage".

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:38.766
They lost the opportunity to have the surgery 
they needed.

00:04:38.766 --> 00:04:43.069
What happens here? When people don't understand

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:46.637
this has severe consequences -- to the individual, 
but also for the country.

00:04:46.637 --> 00:04:49.849
When I don't understand which are my rights, 
the benefits I can have access to,

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.698
I can't understand my duties and I'm not 
an active and participative citizen either.

00:04:54.698 --> 00:04:58.758
Now, maybe, you are sitting there and thinking:

00:04:58.758 --> 00:05:02.745
"Yeah, poor Mr. Domingos... Bad luck, isn't it? 
Me?! I'm in the green ones."

00:05:02.745 --> 00:05:06.798
"I'm absolutely sure that I'm one of the green ones. 
I was selected to come to TED! Hum?" (Laughter)

00:05:06.798 --> 00:05:11.126
So the deal is: I have here some texts to read to you

00:05:11.126 --> 00:05:14.970
and I'm going to see what color are you 
when I finish reading.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.669
So, come on, this is an automobile insurance 
contract. It says this:

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:25.155
"Unless contrary stipulation, the decease of the ensured person, the ensured capital is provided,

00:05:25.155 --> 00:05:30.990
in case of predeceasing of the beneficiary relatively to the ensured person, to the heirs of the last,

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.419
in case of the simultaneous decease of the ensured person and of the beneficiary,

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.821
to the heirs of the last". Hum? (Laughter)

00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:41.865
Next, there's another one, from the medicines' 
package leaflet, that says the following:

00:05:41.865 --> 00:05:49.268
"Warning! It may also occur erythema, edema, 
vesiculation, keratolysis and urticaria."

00:05:49.329 --> 00:05:52.151
Hum? Are you clear?

00:05:52.335 --> 00:05:55.726
And this one is really good. This one, I signed
a renting contract to the new office on Friday

00:05:55.726 --> 00:05:57.054
and I laughed my head off.

00:05:57.054 --> 00:06:02.614
So, it said: "I, as a cosigner, assume the opportune 
payment of the rents,

00:06:02.614 --> 00:06:06.430
waiving the benefits of the division 
and prior foreclosure."

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.942
When I heard "opportune payment" ["storm payment" 
in Portuguese], I imagined myself bursting in there,

00:06:09.942 --> 00:06:13.828
slamming the door and saying: "Here's the money!!!"
(Laughter)

00:06:13.828 --> 00:06:15.177
But it's not! (Laughter) (Applause)

00:06:15.177 --> 00:06:16.126
But it's not! (Applause)

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:17.331
(Applause)

00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:20.252
(Applause)

00:06:20.329 --> 00:06:24.313
So, it's this: when we leave our area of expertise --

00:06:24.313 --> 00:06:27.942
and it only takes a little; there is no need to go 
to the string theory or something like that,

00:06:27.942 --> 00:06:29.532
it only takes a little... (Laughter)

00:06:29.532 --> 00:06:31.273
What happens?

00:06:31.273 --> 00:06:34.969
We get as lost as Mr. Domingos.

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:38.942
And these documents are not written 
by experts to experts,

00:06:38.942 --> 00:06:40.791
as the ones from the string theory.

00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:44.239
No! These are documents written for me, 
these are the public documents,

00:06:44.239 --> 00:06:47.943
the public documents I need to understand 
in my daily life,

00:06:47.943 --> 00:06:49.533
to govern myself, to live my life.

00:06:49.533 --> 00:06:52.268
These are the renting contracts, the package leaflet 
of the medicines.

00:06:52.268 --> 00:06:55.257
It's all this. The electricity bills.

00:06:55.426 --> 00:06:57.299
This has to be clear, so that I can understand.

00:06:57.299 --> 00:06:59.659
Because, if I can't understand, what happens?

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:02.988
I make mistakes, I get wrong.

00:07:02.988 --> 00:07:07.021
I'm going to give you an example of mistakes that 
were committed, bad decisions made

00:07:07.021 --> 00:07:09.265
for not being able to understand documents.

00:07:09.265 --> 00:07:13.004
Do you remember the subprime crisis that 
took place in the United States?

00:07:13.004 --> 00:07:15.201
What happened?

00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:18.178
People signed those loans to buy houses,

00:07:18.178 --> 00:07:20.401
without truly understanding what they were signing.

00:07:20.401 --> 00:07:22.665
Because if they knew what they were signing,

00:07:22.665 --> 00:07:28.815
they'd know that as soon as the interest rate started
to rise, the monthly payment would also increase,

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:31.999
they wouldn't be able to pay anymore and 
they would end up without a house.

00:07:31.999 --> 00:07:36.056
So, the rest, after that, next, everything 
crumbled down and we know the rest.

00:07:36.056 --> 00:07:41.319
Do you think that if there was a culture of clarity 
in the financial sector

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:43.346
things would have got up to where they've got?

00:07:43.346 --> 00:07:46.851
I don't think so. So,

00:07:46.851 --> 00:07:50.177
how do you solve this problem,

00:07:50.239 --> 00:07:53.396
this such big difference between the 
literacy [rate] of the Portuguese,

00:07:53.427 --> 00:07:56.446
that is down here, and the complexity 
of the public documents,

00:07:56.446 --> 00:07:59.913
those ones we need to understand
in our daily lives, sorry,

00:07:59.913 --> 00:08:01.487
that are up here?

00:08:01.487 --> 00:08:04.058
So, the first think that comes to mind is,

00:08:04.058 --> 00:08:07.334
"If literacy is down here, let's make it rise" -- isn't it?

00:08:07.334 --> 00:08:09.256
Let's educate people.

00:08:09.272 --> 00:08:12.407
Let's, let's... of course we will, 
of course we will educate people.

00:08:12.407 --> 00:08:16.526
The thing is, it's hard and it's slow. 
And I don't even want to imagine

00:08:16.526 --> 00:08:20.681
how many generations it will take until we are 
at Sweden's level.

00:08:20.681 --> 00:08:23.178
But, besides that, it's not only because it is slow. 
There is another problem.

00:08:23.178 --> 00:08:27.011
If the language of the documents 
isn't simpler,

00:08:27.011 --> 00:08:32.010
we've already seen that people, even with 
a high literacy level, like you,

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.174
if the language is hard, they don't get cleared,

00:08:35.174 --> 00:08:38.072
they continue to be unable to understand
these documents.

00:08:38.072 --> 00:08:42.076
So, besides increasing literacy [rate], and for now,

00:08:42.076 --> 00:08:46.170
it's much more important to reduce 
the complexity of documents

00:08:46.231 --> 00:08:49.049
and simplify the language.

00:08:50.634 --> 00:08:52.635
I'm going to show you an example.

00:08:52.635 --> 00:08:54.636
When I talk about simplifying the language. 
Notice!

00:08:54.636 --> 00:08:58.711
On the left side of a contract:

00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:02.145
"It is agreed that the insurance company, bla bla bla, 
bla bla bla, bla bla..."

00:09:02.145 --> 00:09:06.644
This is a before and after example. What do we mean with simplifying language?

00:09:06.644 --> 00:09:14.449
It's communicating in a simple and clear way, 
enabling our reader to understand it at first glance.

00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:18.373
What do you prefer? Before or after?

00:09:18.373 --> 00:09:20.641
There isn't much doubt, is there?

00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:26.779
So, how is this achieved? How can you make 
the State and companies communicate

00:09:26.779 --> 00:09:29.988
with citizens in a language they can understand 
at first glance?

00:09:29.988 --> 00:09:33.409
There are several ways. There are countries 
that are going by the path of legislation.

00:09:33.409 --> 00:09:39.474
For example, Sweden and the United States 
introduced, last year, a legislation that forces

00:09:39.474 --> 00:09:42.979
the State to communicate with people in 
a language they can understand.

00:09:42.979 --> 00:09:45.984
And you think, "Well, that's normal. 
They are countries that are a bit ahead.

00:09:45.984 --> 00:09:48.445
"Sweden, maybe, much more than the United States.

00:09:48.445 --> 00:09:50.095
"But they are countries that are a bit ahead.

00:09:50.095 --> 00:09:53.644
"It would be nice if in our country there was also 
legislation towards that, wouldn't it be?"

00:09:53.644 --> 00:09:58.192
So it would. And there is! Since 1999.

00:09:58.192 --> 00:10:00.914
The Law of the Administrative Modernization 
says that

00:10:00.914 --> 00:10:03.590
the communication between the State and the people

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:08.943
should be simple, clear, concise, meaningful, 
without acronyms, bla bla bla...

00:10:08.943 --> 00:10:10.990
But the thing is: it is not applied. So, the question,

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:14.258
the path of going through legislation, 
enforcing through legislation,

00:10:14.258 --> 00:10:18.252
works in those countries where laws 
are made to be applied.

00:10:18.252 --> 00:10:22.823
Now, there is another way, the way of marketing.

00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:25.530
How does that work? It's like this:

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:30.177
private companies change their language; 
communicate in a clearer and simpler way,

00:10:30.177 --> 00:10:32.439
they make a big fuss about it, consumers love it,

00:10:32.439 --> 00:10:35.313
the sales rise, it works beautifully.

00:10:35.313 --> 00:10:37.303
But it works for the private sector.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:42.350
Now, what is the third path, and to me, 
the most important one?

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.615
It's the path of civil movements,

00:10:44.646 --> 00:10:47.271
that are based in a mentality shift.

00:10:47.317 --> 00:10:49.958
In countries where this really went forward --

00:10:49.958 --> 00:10:52.117
do you remember the English label, of the
"Plain English Campaign"? --

00:10:52.117 --> 00:10:55.306
this is all based on a consumers' movement.

00:10:55.306 --> 00:10:59.833
So, what does it take for that civic movement 
to happen?

00:10:59.833 --> 00:11:02.680
We need to understand two very important things:

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:07.711
First, wanting to understand these 
public documents is not a whim,

00:11:07.711 --> 00:11:10.059
is not an intellectual curiosity.

00:11:10.059 --> 00:11:12.227
It is a necessity that I have in my daily life.

00:11:12.227 --> 00:11:15.375
And above all, it is a right, it is everyone's right.

00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:19.120
On this side we have: understanding is a right.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.724
And we have to understand another thing too,

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.313
which is: he who writes, has to write in order 
to be understood.

00:11:24.313 --> 00:11:26.364
How do we get there?

00:11:26.364 --> 00:11:31.290
First of all: we have to become demanding 
consumers and citizens.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:35.765
Think it this way: next time someone 
gives you a document

00:11:35.765 --> 00:11:38.758
that you just simply don't understand, don't be shy,

00:11:38.758 --> 00:11:41.482
don't keep quiet, pretending that you are 
understanding everything.

00:11:41.482 --> 00:11:44.102
No! Demand to understand. Ask.

00:11:44.102 --> 00:11:47.397
I know that this is not easy. Turn to the gentleman 
in the little suite and say:

00:11:47.397 --> 00:11:50.527
"Look here, this contract, this part, 
what does this mean?"

00:11:50.527 --> 00:11:54.741
It's not easy, and perhaps it's even a bit 
embarrassing, isn't it?

00:11:54.741 --> 00:11:56.774
But it is not. It's a sign of intelligence.

00:11:56.774 --> 00:12:00.314
What do you teach your children when 
they have doubts in school?

00:12:00.314 --> 00:12:03.903
"Don't say nothing to anyone, shut up really good 
and act smart."

00:12:03.903 --> 00:12:05.687
No, you don't, right? You say:

00:12:05.687 --> 00:12:09.546
"Look, when you don't understand, you put your hand 
up in the air and ask the teacher until you are cleared."

00:12:09.546 --> 00:12:13.550
And that is exactly what we have to do, 
as consumers and citizens.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:18.175
So, next time you come across with 
a document you don't understand,

00:12:18.175 --> 00:12:20.981
demand to understand, put aside your pride and ask

00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:23.121
until you get completely cleared.

00:12:23.121 --> 00:12:28.612
Then, there's the other side, which is:
"Okay, these awful documents

00:12:28.612 --> 00:12:30.719
"which are in circulation, they don't grow on trees.

00:12:30.719 --> 00:12:32.813
"Someone wrote them." Hum?

00:12:32.813 --> 00:12:37.316
Maybe, among this big group, some persons...

00:12:37.316 --> 00:12:41.969
I don't know, some lawyers, some public employees --
I'm not asking you to identify yourselves,

00:12:41.969 --> 00:12:44.502
but I ask you to search your own conscience.

00:12:44.502 --> 00:12:47.841
How many times do you write documents 
for the general public,

00:12:47.841 --> 00:12:50.457
for people that don't share your language,

00:12:50.457 --> 00:12:53.126
and you write them in a language that 
only you will understand?

00:12:53.126 --> 00:12:56.151
And you'll say: "Ah, that's because 
there is a reason, here!"

00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:57.743
Dear friends, I already heard all the reasons.

00:12:57.743 --> 00:13:00.508
There are thousands of reasons. They go like these:

00:13:00.508 --> 00:13:02.482
"Ah, it's the house's culture"; "Oh, my boss!"

00:13:02.482 --> 00:13:05.257
"Oh, the judge! And what if this goes to court?"

00:13:05.257 --> 00:13:07.838
"What you want is to destroy language. 
We have to educate people."

00:13:07.838 --> 00:13:09.813
"We can't lower the level"; bla, bla, bla...

00:13:09.813 --> 00:13:12.234
I've seen all of this. These are excuses.

00:13:12.234 --> 00:13:14.805
A while ago, they told us about Einstein.

00:13:14.805 --> 00:13:18.683
Einstein said this: "If you can't write about a subject,

00:13:18.683 --> 00:13:21.423
in a simple way, it's because, in fact, 
you don't understand it."

00:13:21.423 --> 00:13:24.967
So, if you... (Applause)

00:13:24.967 --> 00:13:26.877
To Einstein... (Applause)

00:13:26.877 --> 00:13:28.538
To Einstein...(Applause)

00:13:28.538 --> 00:13:31.237
So -- ah, ah, I don't have time! --

00:13:31.237 --> 00:13:35.809
so, if you do know what you want to say -- 
don't you? --

00:13:35.809 --> 00:13:37.975
you are aware of what you want to say,

00:13:37.975 --> 00:13:42.715
you just have to do one thing: believe that it is 
possible to write in a simple way.

00:13:42.715 --> 00:13:44.453
And how do you do that?

00:13:44.453 --> 00:13:48.364
It's very easy. You write to your grandmother. 
Hum?

00:13:48.364 --> 00:13:50.212
You write to your grandmother. I'm going 
to show grandma to you.

00:13:50.212 --> 00:13:52.522
(Laughter)

00:13:52.522 --> 00:13:54.281
You write with respect and without paternalism.

00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:57.780
And you use three techniques that I'm going 
to teach you. First of all:

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.016
Start by the most important.

00:14:00.016 --> 00:14:03.895
Grandma has a lot to do. She is not going to read
three pages to get to the main idea.

00:14:03.895 --> 00:14:06.096
Start by the most important.

00:14:06.096 --> 00:14:09.768
Next, use short sentences, because grandma,

00:14:09.768 --> 00:14:10.978
like anyone of us,

00:14:10.978 --> 00:14:12.655
if you make very long sentences,

00:14:12.655 --> 00:14:15.189
she gets to the end and she can't remember what 
you said in the beginning, anymore.

00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:19.845
And lastly, the third, use plain words, those ones 
that grandma knows.

00:14:19.845 --> 00:14:22.163
Alright? It's easy!

00:14:22.163 --> 00:14:23.728
Before I leave,

00:14:23.728 --> 00:14:26.746
I would like to talk to you about "Clara" (Clear). 
"Clara" is a project of social responsibility.

00:14:26.746 --> 00:14:30.638
It has this mission: to change the way how public communication is made.

00:14:30.638 --> 00:14:31.569
What do we do?

00:14:31.569 --> 00:14:35.356
We are going to launch this year 
a collection of "Claro" guides,

00:14:35.356 --> 00:14:39.453
that is, we are going to pick very, very, 
very complex subjects and put them simple.

00:14:39.453 --> 00:14:41.633
We are going to start with the 
"Claro" Guide of Justice.

00:14:41.633 --> 00:14:45.500
I think it is an area... that comes in handy. 
(Applause)

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.082
And now I'm going to follow Manuel [Forjaz]'s advise. 
If it's time to ask,

00:14:48.082 --> 00:14:51.096
whoever wants to sponsor the 
"Claro" Guide of Justice -- I don't know...

00:14:51.096 --> 00:14:54.164
for example, the EDP Foundation, or...ha? --

00:14:54.164 --> 00:14:57.042
come talk to me later.

00:14:57.042 --> 00:15:01.376
Another thing we will do is to grant prizes 
to the worse and best documents,

00:15:01.376 --> 00:15:04.895
because, indeed, there are people who are working
to communicate in a clearer way,

00:15:04.895 --> 00:15:06.144
and that have to be rewarded,

00:15:06.144 --> 00:15:09.737
and there are lazy people that do nothing 
about it and need to be humiliated.

00:15:09.737 --> 00:15:12.142
So, we'll give prizes to the worst and to the best.

00:15:12.142 --> 00:15:13.883
I'm counting on your help. (Applause)

00:15:13.883 --> 00:15:18.406
(Applause)

00:15:18.406 --> 00:15:22.421
We are going to launch... we are going to launch
the campaign via Clara's Facebook,

00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:25.512
so, send your friendship request and 
you'll be up to date.

00:15:25.512 --> 00:15:27.938
But, lastly, above all, what does "Clara" want?

00:15:27.938 --> 00:15:29.755
It wants to put two little things in your heads.

00:15:29.755 --> 00:15:33.399
The first one: demand to understand. Don't be shy.

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:37.680
And write in order to be understood. 
Write to your grandma.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:42.096
And if you don't have a grandmother, write to 
Mr. Domingos, he will like it.

00:15:42.096 --> 00:15:44.973
Thank you. (Applause)
