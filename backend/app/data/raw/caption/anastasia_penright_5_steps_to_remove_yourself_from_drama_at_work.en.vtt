00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:16.015
Alright. I have a close,
tight-knit circle of friends.

00:00:16.468 --> 00:00:20.004
We're all in different cities
and we're all in different areas,

00:00:20.028 --> 00:00:23.824
from local news to city government

00:00:23.848 --> 00:00:27.476
to law, financial services ...

00:00:27.965 --> 00:00:29.885
And despite those different areas,

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:33.553
we seem to share similar stories
of workplace drama.

00:00:34.232 --> 00:00:36.479
Now, I define workplace drama as

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:39.539
an annoyance that adds
additional stress to the job.

00:00:39.868 --> 00:00:42.055
So again, it's when people
get on your nerves,

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:43.712
not the job itself.

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.326
So as we're going through these stories,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.130
I'm realizing there has to be a better way
for us to coexist with our coworkers

00:00:51.154 --> 00:00:53.343
without this much drama.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.544
So I created a few steps
that have been working for me,

00:00:57.568 --> 00:00:59.872
and I'm happy to share them
with you guys today.

00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:01.960
Step 1: rewind and reflect,

00:01:01.984 --> 00:01:06.760
also known as, "What did I do?"

00:01:07.926 --> 00:01:12.125
I want you guys to all replay
your most recent workplace drama situation

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:13.895
in your head like a movie.

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:17.445
Ignore all of the emotion
and just focus on you.

00:01:18.016 --> 00:01:20.628
But for now, let's just
think about this hypothetical:

00:01:21.303 --> 00:01:23.359
say you're on a group project,

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:26.288
you each have your own
individual assignments

00:01:26.312 --> 00:01:28.875
and then you all divide up the work.

00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:32.291
But then someone
becomes unresponsive --

00:01:32.315 --> 00:01:35.287
not answering calls, they go ghost.

00:01:35.823 --> 00:01:40.386
Then you or someone else has to now
pick up that additional slack.

00:01:41.431 --> 00:01:46.660
So in a brief, small,
very tiny lapse in judgment,

00:01:46.684 --> 00:01:48.639
you vent to the nearby coworker.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.026
Then all of a sudden,
your ghost comes back,

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.961
and they surprisingly know
everything you just said.

00:01:54.985 --> 00:01:56.431
(Laughter)

00:01:56.455 --> 00:01:58.531
Now, what did I do in this situation?

00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:02.191
I vented to someone
who was not my confidant.

00:02:02.842 --> 00:02:04.403
Why would I do that?

00:02:04.878 --> 00:02:08.440
Sometimes we create
this unspoken bond with people

00:02:08.464 --> 00:02:10.895
that only exists in our heads.

00:02:11.483 --> 00:02:13.912
They don't owe me their discretion.

00:02:13.936 --> 00:02:15.948
I just assumed it was there.

00:02:16.486 --> 00:02:18.548
So we're not going to go
down a rabbit hole,

00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:20.472
trying to figure out why they did that.

00:02:20.496 --> 00:02:22.051
It doesn't matter. They did it.

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:25.762
But the goal in this step
is self-reflection.

00:02:25.786 --> 00:02:28.428
We need to focus on what did we do

00:02:28.452 --> 00:02:30.353
so we can avoid it in the future.

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:34.545
Step 2: come back to reality,

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.983
also known as, "It needs to stop."

00:02:37.007 --> 00:02:38.022
(Laughter)

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:42.775
So you guys ever think about problems
before you get to work?

00:02:43.444 --> 00:02:44.631
Oh -- it's just me?

00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:46.141
(Laughter)

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:48.246
Well, I'm guilty of it.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.532
I think about all of these
situations in my head,

00:02:51.556 --> 00:02:54.367
and then I get mad just thinking about it.

00:02:55.065 --> 00:02:58.092
So I'm telling myself,
"No, you're just being prepared, Stacy."

00:02:58.116 --> 00:02:59.132
(Laughter)

00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:01.262
"You are just making sure
that you can handle

00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:03.421
whatever they're about to throw at you."

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:05.458
But you're not.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.345
What you're really doing
is setting yourself up

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:11.178
and creating this anxiety in your head

00:03:11.202 --> 00:03:13.294
that doesn't exist.

00:03:14.104 --> 00:03:15.952
Then we also have to be careful about

00:03:15.976 --> 00:03:18.589
listening to other people's
made-up scenarios.

00:03:18.613 --> 00:03:20.006
Here's what I mean.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.713
Let's say you're in the break room,

00:03:21.737 --> 00:03:24.132
and you're talking to some coworkers.

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:27.706
Then, all of a sudden,
another coworker comes in.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.358
Now, they seem to just be
in deep thought --

00:03:30.382 --> 00:03:32.933
not overly cheerful, but they're not rude.

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:35.579
They come in, they walk out.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.703
Then the coworkers over here
begin to diagnose

00:03:39.727 --> 00:03:42.223
what they feel is wrong
with that person.

00:03:42.744 --> 00:03:44.156
They're saying things like,

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.722
"Oh, they're just mad
they didn't get the job."

00:03:47.307 --> 00:03:49.092
Or they're saying, "Oh, no, no, no --

00:03:49.116 --> 00:03:51.476
during this season,
they're just always upset."

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.154
And you're sitting here
like, yep, that must be it.

00:03:56.178 --> 00:03:58.647
You're listening to this
as if this is facts.

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.030
Meanwhile, this coworker
can be in deep thought

00:04:03.054 --> 00:04:05.444
about literally anything.

00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:08.303
They could have just opened
a pack of Starburst,

00:04:08.327 --> 00:04:09.773
got four yellows back-to-back,

00:04:09.797 --> 00:04:12.257
and they're just trying
to figure out what happened.

00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:14.612
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:14.636 --> 00:04:17.071
But you're over here listening.

00:04:17.706 --> 00:04:20.433
And you're listening
to their made-up scenario

00:04:20.457 --> 00:04:21.830
that now can impact

00:04:21.854 --> 00:04:25.102
how you choose to interact
with that person throughout the day.

00:04:25.907 --> 00:04:29.598
Whether we're creating
fake stories in our head

00:04:29.622 --> 00:04:32.323
or listening to other people's
made-up stories,

00:04:32.347 --> 00:04:34.026
it needs to stop.

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.599
The goal in this step:

00:04:36.623 --> 00:04:39.699
stop stressing over things
that haven't happened.

00:04:40.783 --> 00:04:43.079
Alright. Step 3:

00:04:44.293 --> 00:04:46.606
vent and release.

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.091
It's good to have a vent buddy.

00:04:49.774 --> 00:04:52.815
This is your coach, your cheerleader,

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:54.031
your therapist,

00:04:54.055 --> 00:04:57.046
whatever you need them
to be in the moment.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.771
This is not like that person in Step 1
that just happened to be in earshot.

00:05:00.795 --> 00:05:04.263
You have an established relationship
with your vent buddy.

00:05:04.989 --> 00:05:06.600
Now, here's another scenario.

00:05:08.022 --> 00:05:10.827
You're getting ready to tell
a customer or a client

00:05:10.851 --> 00:05:12.946
something that they
just don't want to hear.

00:05:13.607 --> 00:05:16.063
So, as you're in the middle of this spiel,

00:05:16.087 --> 00:05:18.548
up comes another coworker,

00:05:18.572 --> 00:05:20.740
and they interrupt you

00:05:20.764 --> 00:05:24.164
and then says the exact
same thing you were saying.

00:05:24.799 --> 00:05:26.979
You can't make a scene
in front of a customer.

00:05:27.003 --> 00:05:31.932
So you just have to sit back,
"Mm-hmm," and just listen as they do this.

00:05:31.956 --> 00:05:33.612
And you're burning up inside.

00:05:34.184 --> 00:05:35.581
So what do we do?

00:05:35.605 --> 00:05:37.221
We go to our vent buddy.

00:05:37.698 --> 00:05:39.951
We talk about it. We get mad.

00:05:39.975 --> 00:05:42.021
And that's the time for that. Get mad.

00:05:42.045 --> 00:05:43.196
Get angry.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.371
Curse, scream,

00:05:44.395 --> 00:05:47.316
do whatever you need to do
to get it out.

00:05:47.973 --> 00:05:49.564
Now here's the hard part:

00:05:50.413 --> 00:05:54.070
you then have to switch
that tone to positivity.

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.383
I truly believe in positive
and negative energy,

00:05:58.407 --> 00:06:02.098
and it has a way of controlling
our moods throughout the day.

00:06:03.083 --> 00:06:07.342
You've got to think of things like,
"OK, where do I go from here?

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:09.169
What can I do differently?"

00:06:09.723 --> 00:06:11.462
And then, if you're the vent buddy,

00:06:11.486 --> 00:06:15.629
it's your responsibility
to lead your friend back to the positive.

00:06:16.957 --> 00:06:19.186
Now, the other hard part:

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.045
you have to then apply
those learnings to the situation.

00:06:23.496 --> 00:06:25.561
You can't carry that resentment around.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.655
If you do, that one-off situation
now becomes a pattern.

00:06:32.251 --> 00:06:37.051
Pattern behavior is harder to ignore
than a one-off situation.

00:06:37.795 --> 00:06:39.661
The goal in this step is,

00:06:39.685 --> 00:06:46.317
"Let's turn our vent session
into a productive conversation."

00:06:47.388 --> 00:06:48.739
Step 4:

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:51.533
learn a new language,

00:06:51.557 --> 00:06:53.878
also known as, "We need to talk."

00:06:55.537 --> 00:06:59.637
Guys, I personally don't like
to pick up the phone at work.

00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:00.883
I just don't.

00:07:00.907 --> 00:07:04.162
I feel like whatever you need to say to me
can be an instant message

00:07:04.186 --> 00:07:05.340
or an email.

00:07:05.364 --> 00:07:07.101
That is my work language.

00:07:07.125 --> 00:07:08.288
(Laughter)

00:07:08.312 --> 00:07:10.281
The only problem with that,

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:12.736
you can't hear tone through an email.

00:07:13.424 --> 00:07:17.727
I read emails the same way I speak,

00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:21.368
so I'm pretty sure I've misinterpreted
some tones before,

00:07:21.392 --> 00:07:22.622
unless I know you.

00:07:22.974 --> 00:07:24.145
So here's an example.

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:27.161
I'm going to show you guys an email,
and I want you to read it,

00:07:27.185 --> 00:07:29.275
and then I'm going to read it out loud.

00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:38.213
Alright, that was fast enough,
you should have read it.

00:07:38.237 --> 00:07:39.251
(Laughter)

00:07:39.275 --> 00:07:40.426
"Stacy,

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.522
Thank you for reaching out about my group.

00:07:42.556 --> 00:07:45.265
At this time, we will not need
any additional support.

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:49.291
Going forward, if I feel we need help,
I'll ask, you won't have to reach out.

00:07:49.315 --> 00:07:52.013
Per my last email (attached below),

00:07:52.037 --> 00:07:54.125
I've outlined what I do, and what you do,

00:07:54.149 --> 00:07:56.233
so we can avoid this in the future.

00:07:56.257 --> 00:07:59.044
As always, thank you
for your partnership!!"

00:08:00.417 --> 00:08:01.568
Guys ...

00:08:01.592 --> 00:08:02.668
(Laughter)

00:08:02.692 --> 00:08:03.926
That's how you read it?

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.378
(Laughter)

00:08:06.402 --> 00:08:08.754
Guys, there are certain words in there

00:08:08.778 --> 00:08:12.365
that if you hear
or if you see in an email,

00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:16.152
it is safe to assume
they typed it with their middle fingers.

00:08:16.176 --> 00:08:19.590
(Laughter)

00:08:19.614 --> 00:08:22.381
I didn't know it then. I know it now.

00:08:22.405 --> 00:08:24.557
(Laughter)

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.543
I think I messed up some people's emails.
They're correcting them.

00:08:28.567 --> 00:08:29.632
(Laughter)

00:08:29.656 --> 00:08:31.271
With all of that said,

00:08:31.295 --> 00:08:34.793
you have to know when it is time
to pick up the phone.

00:08:34.817 --> 00:08:37.947
You have to know when it is time
to have a face-to-face.

00:08:38.446 --> 00:08:41.328
And these face-to-face
conversations are not easy.

00:08:41.352 --> 00:08:44.153
They are difficult,
but they are necessary.

00:08:44.652 --> 00:08:48.543
The goal is to try to understand
the other person's perspective.

00:08:48.954 --> 00:08:51.647
So you'll start the conversation
with things like,

00:08:51.671 --> 00:08:53.827
"OK, you got upset when I ..."

00:08:53.851 --> 00:08:55.431
Or you'll say things like,

00:08:55.455 --> 00:08:58.074
"OK, you already had
the situation handled,

00:08:58.098 --> 00:08:59.707
and then I ..."

00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:03.213
So that way, you can see
exactly where they're coming from.

00:09:04.258 --> 00:09:07.524
Also, don't try to make people like you.

00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:11.741
We all have our own upbringings.
We all have our experiences.

00:09:11.765 --> 00:09:15.323
And we all have our own
communication styles.

00:09:15.987 --> 00:09:18.766
As the new generations
are entering the workforce,

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.465
we're also adapting to it.

00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:22.847
Meetings are now emails.

00:09:22.871 --> 00:09:24.880
Emails are now texts.

00:09:24.904 --> 00:09:26.702
Off-sites are now Skype.

00:09:27.647 --> 00:09:29.271
So as we're adjusting to that,

00:09:29.295 --> 00:09:32.103
we need to at least try to understand

00:09:32.127 --> 00:09:35.072
what type of style
of communication they use.

00:09:36.019 --> 00:09:38.135
The goal in that step

00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:41.418
is to really understand
their work language

00:09:41.442 --> 00:09:45.761
and accept the fact
that it may be different than yours.

00:09:47.158 --> 00:09:51.962
Step 5: recognize and protect,

00:09:51.986 --> 00:09:55.034
also known as,
"We need to take a walk."

00:09:55.994 --> 00:09:59.029
So here's my last scenario
from one of my teacher friends.

00:10:00.759 --> 00:10:04.212
You're about to have
a meeting with a parent,

00:10:04.236 --> 00:10:07.811
and prior to it, you and a coworker,
you kind of discuss it,

00:10:07.835 --> 00:10:11.020
and the coworker tells you,
"It's alright, I got your back.

00:10:11.044 --> 00:10:13.477
I'm going to agree
with your recommendations."

00:10:14.154 --> 00:10:18.814
So you're kind of side-eyeing them
because they've burned you before,

00:10:18.838 --> 00:10:21.191
but you've had the "we need to talk,"

00:10:21.215 --> 00:10:24.104
so you're like, "We're in sync now,
I'm going to trust them."

00:10:24.615 --> 00:10:26.097
You go through the meeting,

00:10:26.121 --> 00:10:27.766
the parent disagrees with you,

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:31.725
and like clockwork, the coworker
agrees with the parent in front of you,

00:10:31.749 --> 00:10:33.678
making you look ridiculous.

00:10:34.151 --> 00:10:36.791
Again, we can't make a scene
in front of people, right?

00:10:36.815 --> 00:10:38.203
So you've got to hold it in.

00:10:38.227 --> 00:10:40.758
And then, after the meeting,

00:10:40.782 --> 00:10:44.143
that same coworker has all the audacity,

00:10:44.167 --> 00:10:47.100
comes up to you and says,
"Crazy meeting, right?"

00:10:47.124 --> 00:10:49.492
(Laughter)

00:10:49.516 --> 00:10:50.693
Yeah.

00:10:50.717 --> 00:10:53.350
They're testing you now.
It's a test. (Laughs)

00:10:53.374 --> 00:10:55.661
So that's the perfect time
to just go off, right?

00:10:55.685 --> 00:10:57.208
This is a repeat offender.

00:10:57.232 --> 00:10:58.234
(Laughter)

00:10:58.258 --> 00:11:00.530
You walked away,
and they came back with it.

00:11:01.604 --> 00:11:07.723
But we're trying to avoid workplace drama,
not take a cannonball leap into it,

00:11:07.747 --> 00:11:09.549
so we have to walk away.

00:11:10.198 --> 00:11:14.107
You lead that conversation
by taking the first available exit.

00:11:14.676 --> 00:11:16.326
You're not doing this for them.

00:11:16.814 --> 00:11:18.505
You're doing this for you.

00:11:18.529 --> 00:11:21.037
You have to protect your energy.

00:11:21.672 --> 00:11:23.894
Don't try to figure out
why they would do this,

00:11:23.918 --> 00:11:27.031
and no more coming-to-Jesus conversations.

00:11:27.055 --> 00:11:29.496
It is what it is, they did what they did,

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.343
and given the opportunity,
they'd probably do it again.

00:11:33.406 --> 00:11:35.029
But you now know that.

00:11:35.688 --> 00:11:38.007
You now recognize that.

00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:40.156
So that way, you can act accordingly.

00:11:41.605 --> 00:11:46.653
We typically try to set expectations --
our expectations --

00:11:46.677 --> 00:11:48.193
on other people,

00:11:48.217 --> 00:11:51.151
and then get disappointed
when they don't follow through.

00:11:51.881 --> 00:11:57.620
We have to learn
to accept people where they are

00:11:57.644 --> 00:12:01.764
and adjust ourselves
to handle those situations.

00:12:02.731 --> 00:12:04.668
The goal in this step

00:12:04.692 --> 00:12:10.312
is to recognize when it is time
to professionally walk away from someone.

00:12:12.328 --> 00:12:17.515
Guys, I realize these steps may come off
as saying, "Take the high road."

00:12:17.539 --> 00:12:20.825
And people always say it.
"Just take the high road."

00:12:20.849 --> 00:12:24.325
And they describe it as some
elegant path of righteousness

00:12:24.349 --> 00:12:26.565
filled with rainbows and unicorns.

00:12:27.359 --> 00:12:28.678
It's not that.

00:12:30.543 --> 00:12:32.144
It's embarrassing.

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:33.533
It's humiliating.

00:12:33.557 --> 00:12:37.242
It leaves this knot of resentment
in the pit of your stomach.

00:12:38.638 --> 00:12:42.135
And as you're traveling down
this amazing high road,

00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:44.907
you see billboards of things
you shoulda said

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:46.803
and things you shoulda did.

00:12:46.827 --> 00:12:49.110
You go over there
and you look at the easy road,

00:12:49.134 --> 00:12:51.473
and they're chillin',
not worried about a thing.

00:12:52.536 --> 00:12:54.801
But I have to admit,

00:12:54.825 --> 00:12:59.060
the more I travel down this road,
it does get a little easier.

00:13:00.219 --> 00:13:03.857
Petty situations, they don't
bother me as much.

00:13:04.638 --> 00:13:07.461
I learn little nuggets here and there.

00:13:08.585 --> 00:13:11.138
And as I continue down this path,

00:13:12.108 --> 00:13:15.220
there seem to be more
opportunities waiting for me.

00:13:15.845 --> 00:13:19.468
I have like-minded people
who want to connect with me,

00:13:19.492 --> 00:13:22.340
projects that people want me on,

00:13:22.364 --> 00:13:23.637
leaders reaching out

00:13:23.661 --> 00:13:26.690
because they heard about me
through someone else.

00:13:28.579 --> 00:13:30.284
And the best part?

00:13:30.878 --> 00:13:33.809
The need to even look at the easy road

00:13:33.833 --> 00:13:35.256
is no longer there.

00:13:36.552 --> 00:13:40.053
Guys, we're not going to change
the way adults act in the workplace.

00:13:40.077 --> 00:13:41.436
We are not.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.881
And for that reason,
there will always be workplace drama.

00:13:46.912 --> 00:13:49.159
But if we stick to these steps

00:13:49.183 --> 00:13:52.394
and put in the work that comes with it,

00:13:52.418 --> 00:13:54.569
we can learn to avoid it.

00:13:55.172 --> 00:13:57.543
Guys, thank you for being my vent buddies.

00:13:57.567 --> 00:13:58.837
(Laughter)

00:13:58.861 --> 00:14:01.023
And thank you so much for your time.

00:14:01.047 --> 00:14:04.601
(Applause)
