00:00:13.317 --> 00:00:15.158
I have to admit that it's a lot of fun

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:17.147
when people ask me what I do for my job,

00:00:17.171 --> 00:00:19.897
because I tell them
I literally rub things together.

00:00:20.524 --> 00:00:22.233
This sounds ridiculous,

00:00:22.257 --> 00:00:24.385
just rubbing things together.

00:00:25.403 --> 00:00:27.984
But it has a technical name:

00:00:28.917 --> 00:00:30.308
tribology.

00:00:30.332 --> 00:00:33.869
T-r-i-b-o-l-o-g-y,

00:00:33.893 --> 00:00:35.714
from the ancient Greek word "tribos,"

00:00:35.738 --> 00:00:37.071
which means "to rub."

00:00:37.835 --> 00:00:40.770
It's a funny-sounding word
you've probably never heard before,

00:00:40.794 --> 00:00:41.948
but I promise you,

00:00:41.972 --> 00:00:45.076
discovering it changes your experience
with the physical world.

00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:48.232
Tribology has given me amazing projects.

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:52.204
I've worked on materials that fly,
and I've worked on dog food --

00:00:52.228 --> 00:00:55.661
a combination that doesn't sound like
one person has any business doing

00:00:55.685 --> 00:00:57.834
in the span of just a couple years,

00:00:57.858 --> 00:01:01.204
until you start to view the world
through a tribological lens.

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:03.731
And I think you'll be surprised

00:01:03.755 --> 00:01:07.016
at how significant
a little bit of tribology can be

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.461
in alleviating some very large problems.

00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:14.854
Tribology is the study of friction,
wear and lubrication.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.404
You have all experienced
all three of these things.

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.498
Remember the last time you tried
to move a heavy object across the floor,

00:01:22.522 --> 00:01:24.776
and you could just feel
something resisting you?

00:01:25.206 --> 00:01:26.467
That would be friction.

00:01:26.907 --> 00:01:29.300
Friction is the force that opposes motion.

00:01:30.237 --> 00:01:32.603
Wear is the loss or transfer of material.

00:01:33.021 --> 00:01:35.673
It's the reason you have to replace
your favorite shoes,

00:01:35.697 --> 00:01:37.604
because eventually the soles disappear.

00:01:38.146 --> 00:01:40.435
Lubricants are used
to reduce friction and wear.

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:44.288
They loosen up those stubborn rusted bolts
that just otherwise will not budge.

00:01:45.592 --> 00:01:49.246
But tribology is also defined
as the science of interacting surfaces

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.463
in relative motion.

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:56.536
So, interacting surfaces
in relative motion:

00:01:57.456 --> 00:01:59.339
there are a lot of those in the world.

00:01:59.363 --> 00:02:02.577
As you're sitting there right now,
are you wiggling your foot at all

00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:04.426
or maybe shifting around in your seat?

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.710
Because guess what?
Tribology is happening.

00:02:06.734 --> 00:02:08.828
Even the smallest shift in your seat

00:02:08.852 --> 00:02:11.798
involves two surfaces
moving relative to each other.

00:02:12.435 --> 00:02:14.703
And your tribological
interaction for the shift

00:02:14.727 --> 00:02:16.919
will be different than
the person next to you.

00:02:16.943 --> 00:02:18.964
This is because the clothes you're wearing

00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:21.245
change the friction
between you and the seat.

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.741
If you're wearing silk, it's a little
easier to squirm around in the seat

00:02:24.765 --> 00:02:26.108
than if you're wearing wool.

00:02:26.132 --> 00:02:28.305
That's because the friction
is lower for silk.

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:31.933
If you're moving your ankle
or wiggling your ankle at all,

00:02:31.957 --> 00:02:33.677
did it make a popping sound?

00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:35.616
You've had that, right?

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.434
You get up, you move around,
and some joint cracks or pops.

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.191
Thank you for that sound, tribology.

00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:44.787
That sound can come from the fluid
that lubricates your joints

00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:46.029
just moving around.

00:02:46.053 --> 00:02:48.690
You're essentially releasing
gas bubbles in that fluid.

00:02:49.524 --> 00:02:53.244
That sound can also come from the tendons
simply moving over each other.

00:02:53.268 --> 00:02:55.002
Pretty common in the ankle,

00:02:55.026 --> 00:02:57.037
so any of my fellow
foot-wigglers out there

00:02:57.061 --> 00:03:00.920
may suddenly find themselves curious
about the tribology of tendons.

00:03:02.596 --> 00:03:05.589
But how does one become
a tribologist like me?

00:03:06.501 --> 00:03:08.613
It starts when you're a kid, of course.

00:03:08.637 --> 00:03:10.245
I was a ballerina growing up.

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.899
I reached the level
where I was dancing on my toes,

00:03:12.923 --> 00:03:14.243
or "en pointe."

00:03:14.816 --> 00:03:18.237
Now, when you're dancing en pointe,
you're wearing those amazing shoes,

00:03:18.261 --> 00:03:20.199
but they can be slippery on the stage.

00:03:20.657 --> 00:03:23.979
The last thing you want to do
when you're trying to dance on your toes

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:25.213
is to slip and fall.

00:03:25.237 --> 00:03:27.755
So we had boxes of stuff called rosin.

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:31.342
We would step into the rosin,
put a light coating on our shoes.

00:03:31.366 --> 00:03:32.844
Rosin comes from tree sap

00:03:32.868 --> 00:03:36.324
and, in its powdered form,
makes things less slippery.

00:03:37.124 --> 00:03:38.732
You learned real fast as a dancer

00:03:38.756 --> 00:03:41.166
how much was the right amount
to put on your shoes,

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.389
because if you didn't put enough on,
you were probably going to slip

00:03:44.413 --> 00:03:47.238
due to the low friction
between your shoe and the stage.

00:03:47.262 --> 00:03:48.452
Best case scenario,

00:03:48.476 --> 00:03:50.945
you're the clumsy ballerina on stage,

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.707
but the worst case scenario
would be an injury.

00:03:55.095 --> 00:03:58.852
Already, I was optimizing
and manipulating friction.

00:03:59.467 --> 00:04:02.418
You see, I was destined
to be a tribologist.

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:03.935
(Laughter)

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.411
But you were also a junior tribologist.

00:04:07.927 --> 00:04:09.926
When you used crayons or colored pencils,

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.828
you knew that the harder you pressed,
the darker the color.

00:04:13.424 --> 00:04:16.209
You also knew this meant
you were going to have to sharpen

00:04:16.233 --> 00:04:18.431
that crayon or colored pencil
more frequently,

00:04:18.455 --> 00:04:20.186
because it was wearing down faster.

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.520
Now let's talk about
those enticing shiny waxed floors

00:04:23.544 --> 00:04:25.788
that you just had to slide across.

00:04:26.448 --> 00:04:28.334
You knew if you put on a pair of socks,

00:04:28.358 --> 00:04:31.179
you were going to get
a really good slide across that floor.

00:04:31.203 --> 00:04:33.249
Good luck trying to do that barefoot.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.455
Master manipulators of friction.

00:04:38.395 --> 00:04:39.897
All kids are tribologists.

00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:41.226
What about us as adults?

00:04:42.607 --> 00:04:44.825
At some point today,
you brushed your teeth.

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:46.811
I hope.

00:04:46.835 --> 00:04:48.095
(Laughter)

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:49.708
This is tribology in action.

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:52.998
The toothpaste and toothbrush
are working to remove or wear

00:04:53.022 --> 00:04:54.419
the plaque from your teeth.

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:57.740
For the record, my dad is a dentist.

00:04:57.764 --> 00:05:01.173
Never thought my career was going
to circle back to the family business.

00:05:01.197 --> 00:05:03.982
But one day, we found ourselves
speaking the same language

00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:07.600
when I was tasked with developing a test
to investigate plaque removal.

00:05:08.087 --> 00:05:10.112
Sounded simple enough,

00:05:10.136 --> 00:05:12.505
until I started to look at it
as a tribologist,

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:14.501
and then it became incredibly complex.

00:05:14.941 --> 00:05:17.632
You have hard materials --
those would be your teeth --

00:05:17.656 --> 00:05:21.273
soft materials like your gums,
the toothpaste, the toothbrush.

00:05:21.297 --> 00:05:24.340
There's lubrication --
the form of saliva and water --

00:05:24.364 --> 00:05:27.051
the dynamics of the person
doing the brushing and more.

00:05:27.885 --> 00:05:30.841
I promise if we put diamonds
in your toothpaste,

00:05:30.865 --> 00:05:32.597
you're going to remove that plaque.

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:35.350
Probably going to remove
your teeth as well.

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:39.245
So there's a fine balance to be had
between wearing the plaque away

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:41.097
and not damaging your teeth and gums.

00:05:42.667 --> 00:05:44.640
We're brushing our teeth because we ate.

00:05:44.664 --> 00:05:46.700
Eating is another routine thing we all do.

00:05:46.724 --> 00:05:48.057
Seems simple enough.

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:49.856
But it's another field of tribology,

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.319
and it's not so simple.

00:05:51.932 --> 00:05:54.995
You have the food, which will break
and wear while you're eating,

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:57.786
and that food is interacting
with your teeth, your tongue,

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.137
your saliva, your throat.

00:05:59.161 --> 00:06:03.590
And all of those interactions are going
to influence your experience of eating.

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:07.714
I think you can all recall a moment
where you tried something new

00:06:07.738 --> 00:06:09.558
and you just found yourself going,

00:06:11.493 --> 00:06:12.738
"Well, it tastes alright.

00:06:12.762 --> 00:06:14.536
I really don't like that texture."

00:06:15.535 --> 00:06:19.408
Tribologists are looking at lubricity,
the coefficient of friction,

00:06:19.432 --> 00:06:24.700
as ways to connect mouth feel
and texture to what you're experiencing,

00:06:24.724 --> 00:06:28.330
so that if we're changing the formulations
of what we're eating and drinking

00:06:28.354 --> 00:06:31.517
so the sugar content
or fat content are different,

00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:33.335
how does that change mouth feel?

00:06:33.359 --> 00:06:35.296
How do we quantify that?

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.754
This is what tribologists
are looking to solve.

00:06:38.441 --> 00:06:40.966
And while my colleagues
were in one corner of this lab

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.765
looking at the fat content of yogurt,

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:43.987
I was in another corner

00:06:44.011 --> 00:06:45.507
studying dog food.

00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:48.274
That lab smelled really good,
by the way, let me tell you.

00:06:48.994 --> 00:06:51.462
We all brush our teeth on a regular basis.

00:06:51.486 --> 00:06:53.480
How many of us brush our pets' teeth?

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.019
Animals as adults commonly get
periodontal disease,

00:06:58.043 --> 00:07:00.136
so we really should be
brushing their teeth,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.316
and more pet owners
are starting to do this.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.889
I know my best friend is really great
at brushing her cat's teeth, somehow.

00:07:05.913 --> 00:07:07.852
Good luck trying to do that with my cat.

00:07:07.876 --> 00:07:10.047
So what pet food suppliers
are trying to do

00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:12.623
is incorporate plaque removal
in things like treats.

00:07:13.265 --> 00:07:14.772
If you have a dog,

00:07:14.796 --> 00:07:17.251
you may have observed
that you give a dog a treat,

00:07:17.275 --> 00:07:20.201
and it magically seems to disappear
after just one bite.

00:07:20.225 --> 00:07:21.735
So the added challenge here is:

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:24.130
How do you remove plaque
when you have one bite?

00:07:25.208 --> 00:07:27.723
I developed a benchtop test
to study this problem,

00:07:27.747 --> 00:07:30.239
and to do so, I had to mimic
the oral system of dogs:

00:07:30.263 --> 00:07:33.817
their teeth, plaque, saliva.

00:07:33.841 --> 00:07:35.868
And I used friction and wear measurements

00:07:35.892 --> 00:07:38.894
to study the effectiveness
of that treat on removing plaque.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.733
If you're sitting there right now
thinking about the last time

00:07:43.757 --> 00:07:46.359
you didn't brush your dog's teeth,
you're very welcome.

00:07:46.383 --> 00:07:48.319
But what's the big deal with tribology?

00:07:48.971 --> 00:07:51.401
Let me give you one more example.

00:07:52.133 --> 00:07:55.628
No matter where you are right now,
you got to this location somehow.

00:07:55.652 --> 00:07:57.355
Maybe you walked or rode your bike,

00:07:57.379 --> 00:08:00.420
but for most people in this room,
you probably came in a car.

00:08:01.112 --> 00:08:04.139
Just think about all
the tribological systems in a car.

00:08:04.163 --> 00:08:06.483
You have your personal
interactions with the car,

00:08:06.507 --> 00:08:08.297
the car's interactions with the road

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:11.075
and everything under the hood
and in the drivetrain.

00:08:11.099 --> 00:08:14.616
Some routine maintenance
is directly connected to tribology.

00:08:15.602 --> 00:08:18.472
You know how many miles
your tires are recommended for using

00:08:18.496 --> 00:08:20.028
before you replace them.

00:08:20.052 --> 00:08:22.490
You regularly check
the treads on those tires.

00:08:23.363 --> 00:08:26.610
You're actively monitoring
the wear of your tires.

00:08:27.694 --> 00:08:31.266
Tribology is the study
of wear and friction,

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:34.607
and with tires, friction can be
the difference between a safe arrival

00:08:34.631 --> 00:08:35.798
and a car accident.

00:08:36.466 --> 00:08:39.375
This is because the friction
between your tires and the road

00:08:39.399 --> 00:08:41.920
will influence your acceleration,
your deceleration

00:08:41.944 --> 00:08:43.526
and your stopping distance.

00:08:44.193 --> 00:08:47.526
As a driver, you instinctively
already know how important friction is,

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:49.685
because you know
that when the roads are wet,

00:08:49.709 --> 00:08:52.401
they're more dangerous
because they're slippery.

00:08:52.425 --> 00:08:54.812
This is because the water
is reducing the friction

00:08:54.836 --> 00:08:56.365
between your tires and the road.

00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:59.322
You may recall that friction
is the force that opposes motion,

00:08:59.346 --> 00:09:02.646
so water reducing that force
means it's now easier for you to move,

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.190
hence it's more slippery
when the roads are wet.

00:09:06.436 --> 00:09:08.364
Something else to consider

00:09:08.388 --> 00:09:10.440
is that overcoming friction takes energy,

00:09:11.266 --> 00:09:13.020
so you're losing energy to friction.

00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:16.854
This is one way your tires
can influence your fuel efficiency.

00:09:16.878 --> 00:09:19.810
And, in fact, did you know
that about one-third of the fuel

00:09:19.834 --> 00:09:22.661
that you put into your
internal combustion engine vehicle

00:09:22.685 --> 00:09:24.608
will be spent overcoming friction?

00:09:25.553 --> 00:09:26.795
One-third.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.110
Tribology research
has helped us reduce friction

00:09:30.134 --> 00:09:33.037
and therefore increase
fuel efficiency and reduce emissions.

00:09:33.825 --> 00:09:36.543
Holmberg and Erdemir have actually
done some great studies

00:09:36.567 --> 00:09:38.726
showing the impact
tribology research can have

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:40.462
on reducing our energy consumption.

00:09:40.486 --> 00:09:43.605
And they found that, looking over
the span of 20 years,

00:09:43.629 --> 00:09:45.427
we had the opportunity to reduce

00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:47.709
the energy consumption
of passenger vehicles

00:09:47.733 --> 00:09:49.030
up to 60 percent.

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:51.928
When you think about
all the cars in the world,

00:09:51.952 --> 00:09:53.692
that's a lot of energy we can save.

00:09:54.444 --> 00:09:59.220
It's part of the nearly nine percent
of our current global energy consumption

00:09:59.244 --> 00:10:03.113
that the authors identified
tribology can help us save.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.791
That's a significant amount of energy.

00:10:05.815 --> 00:10:09.506
So when you look at the numbers,
tribology can do some amazing things.

00:10:10.791 --> 00:10:13.450
My colleagues have identified
up to 20 quads of energy

00:10:13.474 --> 00:10:15.536
we can save across the US alone.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.864
To put this in perspective:

00:10:16.888 --> 00:10:22.708
one quad of energy is roughly equivalent
to 180 million barrels of oil,

00:10:22.732 --> 00:10:25.076
and tribology can help us
save 20 times that.

00:10:25.983 --> 00:10:28.678
This is through new materials,
new lubricants,

00:10:28.702 --> 00:10:30.615
novel component design,

00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:34.329
doing things like making wind turbines
more efficient and reliable.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.597
This happened just by putting
31 people in a room

00:10:37.621 --> 00:10:40.011
who viewed the world
through a tribology lens.

00:10:40.576 --> 00:10:43.585
Imagine the opportunities
that will reveal themselves

00:10:43.609 --> 00:10:46.056
as more of us start to see
tribology all around.

00:10:47.391 --> 00:10:50.441
My favorite projects right now
are in aerospace applications.

00:10:50.465 --> 00:10:53.874
I love reducing wear and friction
in these challenging environments.

00:10:53.898 --> 00:10:56.435
I can make materials and parts

00:10:56.459 --> 00:10:59.419
that will reduce the friction
in moving components and engines

00:10:59.443 --> 00:11:01.840
so that they have less force
opposing their motion.

00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:06.249
Less force to move
means they require less power,

00:11:06.273 --> 00:11:08.154
so you can use a smaller actuator,

00:11:08.178 --> 00:11:09.713
which would weigh less,

00:11:09.737 --> 00:11:11.015
which saves fuel.

00:11:11.938 --> 00:11:15.015
I can also help make parts
that last longer through lower wear.

00:11:15.639 --> 00:11:17.139
This will reduce material waste

00:11:17.163 --> 00:11:20.226
and also means we're manufacturing
the parts less frequently,

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.306
so we're saving energy in manufacturing.

00:11:22.997 --> 00:11:26.173
I encourage you to start seeing
tribology in the world around you

00:11:26.197 --> 00:11:30.869
and to think about how you would improve
those interacting surfaces you experience.

00:11:30.893 --> 00:11:32.873
Even the smallest improvements

00:11:32.897 --> 00:11:34.277
really add up.

00:11:35.407 --> 00:11:38.053
Tribology may be a funny-sounding word,

00:11:38.077 --> 00:11:40.752
but it has a huge impact on our world.

00:11:41.424 --> 00:11:42.584
Thank you.

00:11:42.608 --> 00:11:44.895
(Applause)
