00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.905
Currently, most refugees
live in the cities

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.129
rather than in the refugee camps.

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:25.958
We represent over 60 percent

00:00:25.982 --> 00:00:29.074
of the number of refugees globally.

00:00:31.442 --> 00:00:35.233
With the majority of refugees
living in urban areas,

00:00:36.617 --> 00:00:40.982
there is a strong need
for a paradigm shift and new thinking.

00:00:43.363 --> 00:00:47.986
Rather than wasting money
on building walls,

00:00:49.668 --> 00:00:53.688
it would be better to spend on programs

00:00:53.712 --> 00:00:55.970
to help refugees to help themselves.

00:00:55.994 --> 00:01:01.997
(Applause)

00:01:02.736 --> 00:01:07.759
We always have to leave behind
all our possessions.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.073
But not our skills and knowledge.

00:01:13.352 --> 00:01:16.716
If allowed to live a productive life,

00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:20.585
refugees can help themselves

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:24.275
and contribute to the development
of their host country.

00:01:26.748 --> 00:01:29.858
I was born in the city called Bukavu,

00:01:29.882 --> 00:01:31.683
South Kivu,

00:01:31.707 --> 00:01:34.069
in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:38.895
I am the fifth-born
in a family of 12 children.

00:01:40.723 --> 00:01:44.891
My father, a mechanic by profession,

00:01:44.915 --> 00:01:47.680
worked very hard to send me to school.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.909
Just like other young people,

00:01:52.995 --> 00:01:55.288
I had a lot of plans and dreams.

00:01:56.756 --> 00:01:58.870
I wanted to complete my studies,

00:01:59.616 --> 00:02:00.948
get a nice job,

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:04.331
marry and have my own children

00:02:04.355 --> 00:02:05.822
and support my family.

00:02:07.124 --> 00:02:09.434
But this didn't happen.

00:02:11.871 --> 00:02:18.522
War in my homeland forced me
to flee to Uganda in 2008,

00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:20.354
nine years ago.

00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:27.276
My family joined
a steady exodus of refugees

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.052
who settled in Uganda's capital, Kampala.

00:02:32.147 --> 00:02:33.593
In my country,

00:02:35.038 --> 00:02:36.815
I lived already in the city,

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:42.592
and we felt Kampala was much better
than a refugee camp.

00:02:46.046 --> 00:02:48.696
Refugees in the cities

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.616
have always been denied
international assistance,

00:02:54.322 --> 00:02:59.701
even after their recognition
by UNHCR in 1997.

00:03:01.157 --> 00:03:07.442
In addition to the poverty problem
we were confronted with

00:03:07.466 --> 00:03:09.467
as the local urban poor,

00:03:10.546 --> 00:03:14.275
we were facing challenges
due to our refugee status,

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.386
such as a language barrier.

00:03:17.315 --> 00:03:20.766
In Congo, the official language is French.

00:03:21.592 --> 00:03:24.234
But in Uganda, it is English.

00:03:25.282 --> 00:03:28.416
We didn't have access
to education and health.

00:03:29.427 --> 00:03:33.410
We were exposed to harassment,

00:03:33.434 --> 00:03:37.495
exploitation, intimidation
and discrimination.

00:03:39.308 --> 00:03:43.439
Humanitarian organizations mostly focused

00:03:43.463 --> 00:03:46.218
on the formal settlement in rural areas,

00:03:46.998 --> 00:03:49.779
and there was nothing in place for us.

00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:55.266
But we didn't want handouts.

00:03:56.148 --> 00:03:59.108
We wanted to work and support ourselves.

00:04:00.752 --> 00:04:04.069
I joined my other two colleagues in exile

00:04:04.093 --> 00:04:07.211
and set up an organization
to support other refugees.

00:04:08.655 --> 00:04:13.268
YARID -- Young African Refugees
for Integral Development --

00:04:13.935 --> 00:04:17.991
began as a conversation
within the Congolese community.

00:04:19.585 --> 00:04:21.743
We asked the community

00:04:21.767 --> 00:04:26.102
how they could organize themselves
to solve these challenges.

00:04:27.514 --> 00:04:31.737
The YARID programs for support
evolve in stages,

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.624
progressing from soccer community,
to English language

00:04:37.648 --> 00:04:39.965
to sewing livelihoods.

00:04:41.655 --> 00:04:46.245
The soccer changed the energy

00:04:46.269 --> 00:04:48.569
of unemployed youth

00:04:48.593 --> 00:04:52.031
and connected people
from different communities.

00:04:53.173 --> 00:04:55.260
The free English classes

00:04:55.284 --> 00:04:59.791
help empower people to engage
with the Ugandan community,

00:04:59.815 --> 00:05:03.974
allowing them to get to know
their neighbors and sell wares.

00:05:05.584 --> 00:05:10.982
The vocational training program
offers livelihood skills,

00:05:11.006 --> 00:05:15.434
and with them, important opportunities
for economic self-reliance.

00:05:16.101 --> 00:05:20.204
We've seen so many families

00:05:20.228 --> 00:05:22.680
become self-sustaining.

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:26.835
We've seen who no longer needs our help.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.892
As YARID's programs have expanded,

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.914
it has included an increasing
range of nationalities --

00:05:39.093 --> 00:05:43.071
Congolese, Rwandan, Burundian,

00:05:43.942 --> 00:05:46.482
Somalis, Ethiopian, South Sudanese.

00:05:47.347 --> 00:05:52.930
Today, YARID has supported
over 3,000 refugees across Kampala

00:05:53.671 --> 00:05:55.326
and continues supporting more.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.950
(Applause)

00:05:59.974 --> 00:06:05.041
Refugees want empowerment, not handouts.

00:06:06.006 --> 00:06:08.966
We know our community better than anyone.

00:06:10.173 --> 00:06:14.998
We understand the challenges
and opportunities we face

00:06:15.022 --> 00:06:16.555
to become self-reliant.

00:06:17.683 --> 00:06:20.579
I know better than anyone

00:06:20.603 --> 00:06:24.126
that initiatives created by refugees work.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.637
They need to be internationally
recognized and supported.

00:06:29.624 --> 00:06:32.451
Give us the support we deserve,

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.855
and we will pay you back with interest.

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:36.219
Thank you so much.

00:06:36.243 --> 00:06:43.047
(Applause)
