00:00:12.261 --> 00:00:13.905
[A provocation from Danny Hillis:]

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.873
[It's time to start talking
about engineering our climate]

00:00:16.897 --> 00:00:20.366
What if there was a way
to build a thermostat

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.133
that allowed you to turn down
the temperature of the earth

00:00:23.157 --> 00:00:24.424
anytime you wanted?

00:00:25.695 --> 00:00:30.085
Now, you would think if somebody
had a plausible idea about how to do that,

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.363
everybody would be very excited about it,

00:00:32.387 --> 00:00:34.982
and there would be lots
of research on how to do it.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.958
But in fact, a lot of people
do understand how to do that.

00:00:40.711 --> 00:00:44.862
But there's not much support
for research in this area.

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:47.631
And I think part of it

00:00:47.655 --> 00:00:50.664
is because there are some real
misunderstandings about it.

00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:54.897
So I'm not going to try to convince you
today that this is a good idea.

00:00:55.863 --> 00:01:00.546
But I am going to try to get
your curiosity going about it

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.736
and clear up some
of the misunderstandings.

00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:08.387
So, the basic idea of solar geoengineering

00:01:08.411 --> 00:01:11.038
is that we can cool things down

00:01:11.062 --> 00:01:13.800
just by reflecting
a little bit more sunlight

00:01:13.824 --> 00:01:14.978
back into space.

00:01:15.728 --> 00:01:21.030
And ideas about how to do this
have been around literally for decades.

00:01:22.023 --> 00:01:26.482
Clouds are a great way to do that,
these low-lying clouds.

00:01:26.506 --> 00:01:29.028
Everybody knows it's cooler under a cloud.

00:01:29.475 --> 00:01:33.776
I like this cloud because it has exactly
the same water content

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.678
as the transparent air around it.

00:01:36.093 --> 00:01:40.339
And it just shows that even a little bit
of a change in the flow of the air

00:01:40.363 --> 00:01:41.780
can cause a cloud to form.

00:01:42.482 --> 00:01:45.082
We make artificial clouds all the time.

00:01:45.823 --> 00:01:49.180
These are contrails,
which are artificial water clouds

00:01:49.204 --> 00:01:51.695
that are made by the passing
of a jet engine.

00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:57.593
And so, we're already changing
the clouds on earth.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:58.934
By accident.

00:01:58.958 --> 00:02:03.535
Or, if you like to believe it,
by supersecret government conspiracy.

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:05.634
(Laughter)

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:08.783
But we are already doing this quite a lot.

00:02:08.807 --> 00:02:12.379
This is a NASA picture of shipping lanes.

00:02:12.403 --> 00:02:15.831
Passing ships actually cause
clouds to form,

00:02:15.855 --> 00:02:17.966
and this is a big enough effect

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.988
that it actually helps reduce
global warming already by about a degree.

00:02:23.513 --> 00:02:26.447
So we already are doing solar engineering.

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.394
There's lots of ideas
about how to do this.

00:02:29.418 --> 00:02:31.398
People have looked at everything,

00:02:31.422 --> 00:02:34.846
from building giant parasols
out into space

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.794
to fizzing bubble waters in the ocean.

00:02:38.306 --> 00:02:41.521
And some of these are actually
very plausible ideas.

00:02:42.656 --> 00:02:47.014
One that was published recently
by David Keith at Harvard

00:02:47.038 --> 00:02:50.727
is to take chalk and put dust
up into the stratosphere,

00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:53.012
where it reflects off sunlight.

00:02:53.036 --> 00:02:54.489
And that's a really neat idea,

00:02:54.513 --> 00:02:57.934
because chalk is one of the most
common minerals on earth,

00:02:57.958 --> 00:03:01.659
and it's very safe -- it's so safe,
we put it into baby food.

00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:06.864
And basically, if you throw chalk
up into the stratosphere,

00:03:06.888 --> 00:03:11.704
it comes down in a couple of years
all by itself, dissolved in rainwater.

00:03:12.587 --> 00:03:16.714
Now, before you start worrying
about all this chalk in your rainwater,

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:20.949
let me explain to you
how little of it it actually takes.

00:03:21.453 --> 00:03:24.223
And that turns out to be
very easy to calculate.

00:03:25.118 --> 00:03:27.855
This is a back-of-the-envelope
calculation I made.

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.245
(Laughter)

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.459
(Applause)

00:03:31.483 --> 00:03:35.951
I assure you, people have done
much more careful calculations,

00:03:35.975 --> 00:03:37.826
and it comes out with the same answer,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.613
which is that you have to put chalk up
at the rate of about 10 teragrams a year

00:03:43.637 --> 00:03:47.443
to undo the effects of the CO2
that we've already done --

00:03:47.467 --> 00:03:50.912
just in terms of temperature,
not all the effects, but the temperature.

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:53.538
So what does that look like?

00:03:53.562 --> 00:03:56.539
I can't visualize 10 teragrams per year.

00:03:57.593 --> 00:04:03.799
So I asked the Cambridge
Fire Department and Taylor Milsal

00:04:03.823 --> 00:04:05.315
to lend me a hand.

00:04:06.965 --> 00:04:11.534
This is a hose pumping water
at 10 teragrams a year.

00:04:12.506 --> 00:04:15.260
And that is how much

00:04:15.284 --> 00:04:18.863
you would have to pump
into the stratosphere

00:04:18.887 --> 00:04:22.728
to cool the earth back down
to pre-industrial levels.

00:04:23.815 --> 00:04:28.706
And it's amazingly little;
it's like one hose for the entire earth.

00:04:29.244 --> 00:04:31.489
Now of course, you wouldn't
really use a hose,

00:04:31.513 --> 00:04:34.021
you'd fly it up in airplanes
or something like that.

00:04:34.442 --> 00:04:39.537
But it's so little, it would be like
putting a handful of chalk

00:04:39.561 --> 00:04:42.397
into every Olympic
swimming pool full of rain.

00:04:42.886 --> 00:04:44.219
It's almost nothing.

00:04:45.192 --> 00:04:49.545
So why don't people like this idea?

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.291
Why isn't it taken more seriously?

00:04:51.315 --> 00:04:54.109
And there are some
very good reasons for that.

00:04:55.323 --> 00:05:00.372
A lot of people really don't think
we should be talking about this at all.

00:05:00.396 --> 00:05:04.836
And, in fact, I have some
very good friends in the audience

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.265
who I respect a lot,

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.461
who really don't think
I should be talking about this.

00:05:11.056 --> 00:05:13.898
And the reason is that they're concerned

00:05:13.922 --> 00:05:17.374
that if people imagine
there's some easy way out,

00:05:17.398 --> 00:05:20.985
that we won't give up
our addiction to fossil fuels.

00:05:21.553 --> 00:05:23.287
And I do worry about that.

00:05:23.871 --> 00:05:26.101
I think it's actually a serious problem.

00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:31.914
But there's also, I think,
a deeper problem,

00:05:32.657 --> 00:05:38.032
which is: nobody likes the idea
of messing with the entire earth --

00:05:38.056 --> 00:05:39.256
I certainly don't.

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:42.151
I love this planet, I really do.

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:44.214
And I don't want to mess with it.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.470
But we're already changing our atmosphere,

00:05:48.494 --> 00:05:50.049
we're already messing with it.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.261
And so I think it makes sense
for us to look for ways

00:05:57.285 --> 00:05:59.130
to mitigate that impact.

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:01.432
And we need to do research to do that.

00:06:01.456 --> 00:06:03.980
We need to understand
the science behind that.

00:06:04.878 --> 00:06:10.188
I've noticed that there's a theme
that's kind of developed at TED,

00:06:10.212 --> 00:06:14.552
which is kind of, "fear versus hope,"

00:06:14.576 --> 00:06:17.971
or "creativity versus caution."

00:06:19.026 --> 00:06:21.045
And of course, we need both of those.

00:06:21.747 --> 00:06:24.231
So there aren't any silver bullets.

00:06:24.255 --> 00:06:26.533
This is certainly not a silver bullet.

00:06:28.331 --> 00:06:32.135
But we need science to tell us
what our options are;

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:36.474
that informs both
our creativity and our caution.

00:06:37.293 --> 00:06:41.807
So I am an optimist
about our future selves,

00:06:42.426 --> 00:06:46.426
but I'm not an optimist
because I think our problems are small.

00:06:47.204 --> 00:06:53.196
I'm an optimist because I think
our capacity to deal with our problems

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.353
is much greater than we imagine.

00:06:55.859 --> 00:06:57.158
Thank you very much.

00:06:57.182 --> 00:06:58.199
(Applause)

00:06:58.215 --> 00:07:00.373
This talk sparked
a lot of controversy at TED2017,

00:07:00.403 --> 00:07:02.453
and we encourage you
to look at discussions online

00:07:02.483 --> 00:07:03.783
to see other points of view.
