00:00:12.643 --> 00:00:15.897
Stress -- we all know what it is
and we all handle it differently.

00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:18.461
Whether it's our thoughts
speeding up or slowing down,

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:20.443
eating our emotions or not at all,

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:23.410
difficulty sleeping
or just getting out of bed.

00:00:23.434 --> 00:00:25.926
Frankly, it sucks.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.951
(Laughter)

00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:28.910
But there's good stress too, you know,

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:32.308
like preparing for the biggest
public speaking event you've ever given.

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:33.721
(Laughter)

00:00:33.745 --> 00:00:38.509
(Applause)

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:39.938
On a global platform.

00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:41.438
(Laughter)

00:00:41.462 --> 00:00:43.486
No, even the good stress
can mess with you,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.875
but it's the bad stress
that I came to talk about.

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.055
And probably not
for the reason you'd expect.

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.515
I'm a relationship manager
for affluent individuals.

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.657
Meaning, I work with wealthy folks
and their families, hip to hip,

00:00:53.681 --> 00:00:55.707
helping them achieve
their financial goals.

00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:58.143
I like to keep the economy
in mind, because I know

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:00.739
that whatever impacts the economy,
impacts my clients,

00:01:00.763 --> 00:01:03.900
and it turns out stress is impacting
the economy in a massive way.

00:01:03.924 --> 00:01:06.155
What if I told you that by some estimates,

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:11.167
the cost of work-related stress in the US
is close to 300 billion dollars annually?

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:15.641
Workplace stress, the stress
causing this massive impact,

00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:17.609
is related to productivity and wellness.

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:19.712
Today, that's what
we're here to talk about.

00:01:19.736 --> 00:01:23.390
And by the way, it's linked
to employee disengagement,

00:01:23.414 --> 00:01:25.572
chronic diseases that impact your work

00:01:25.596 --> 00:01:27.525
and work-related injuries and illnesses.

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.071
And when you add up the cost
of all five factors,

00:01:30.095 --> 00:01:33.648
it's an estimated
2.2 trillion dollars annually.

00:01:34.596 --> 00:01:37.937
That represents 12 percent of our GDP.

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.109
Now I know what you're thinking,
"That is a lot of money, and how?"

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:43.963
Stress is this deeply personal thing,

00:01:43.987 --> 00:01:46.543
it's crazy to think
it can have such a massive impact.

00:01:46.567 --> 00:01:49.291
But consider this thought
experiment to explain how.

00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:52.098
Imagine a single mother
working a stressful job,

00:01:52.122 --> 00:01:53.661
in a stress-filled environment,

00:01:53.685 --> 00:01:55.947
where she sits 90 percent of the time.

00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:57.725
Maybe she doesn't have time to cook,

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:59.950
so she chooses meals
based off of convenience,

00:01:59.974 --> 00:02:01.225
which usually means what?

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:03.512
Overly processed, high-sugar foods.

00:02:03.536 --> 00:02:06.956
Over time, this poor diet,
mixed with stress from work,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.654
leads to a chronic disease.

00:02:08.678 --> 00:02:10.212
Let's call it diabetes.

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:13.244
Medical care cost her
and the company more money,

00:02:13.268 --> 00:02:14.814
which means more stress.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.094
Now, she's worried about her health
and making ends meet,

00:02:19.118 --> 00:02:21.618
so she's probably distracted
and less productive.

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:23.094
But she can't be, remember?

00:02:23.118 --> 00:02:24.625
She's a single mother.

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:26.427
Now she's thinking,

00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:28.245
"What if something happens to me?

00:02:28.705 --> 00:02:30.538
Who is going to take care of my child?

00:02:30.562 --> 00:02:32.444
Who is going to take care of my baby?"

00:02:32.468 --> 00:02:33.626
More stress.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.417
Now take that scenario,
tweak it whichever way you'd like,

00:02:36.441 --> 00:02:37.749
and lay it over the nation,

00:02:37.773 --> 00:02:39.051
and you might start to see

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:41.767
how we run up against
that multitrillion dollar cost.

00:02:42.546 --> 00:02:44.673
This all hits very close to home for me.

00:02:44.697 --> 00:02:48.427
My father's one of the hardest-working
and most intelligent people that I know.

00:02:48.451 --> 00:02:50.729
Don't get me wrong,
mom worked and provided too,

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:54.134
but he definitely embraced the role
of being the primary breadwinner.

00:02:54.158 --> 00:02:57.070
And I'm sure most of us
can understand the stress and pressure

00:02:57.094 --> 00:02:59.183
that comes with taking care
of our families.

00:02:59.207 --> 00:03:01.476
But when you combine that
with workplace stress,

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.971
do you know what could happen?

00:03:02.995 --> 00:03:05.871
Developing irreversible
high blood pressure,

00:03:05.895 --> 00:03:07.958
eventually losing function of your kidneys

00:03:07.982 --> 00:03:10.442
and spending a decade
on dialysis -- his fate.

00:03:10.466 --> 00:03:13.244
Now I'm happy to report
that he did get a kidney transplant

00:03:13.268 --> 00:03:14.419
just last year.

00:03:14.443 --> 00:03:15.594
However --

00:03:15.618 --> 00:03:19.858
(Applause and cheers)

00:03:19.882 --> 00:03:21.882
However, for nearly a decade,

00:03:21.906 --> 00:03:25.153
neither the economy nor my family
got the benefit from his work ethic

00:03:25.177 --> 00:03:26.359
or his intelligence,

00:03:26.383 --> 00:03:27.565
and as he would say,

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:29.644
that's just really sad commentary.

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:31.002
All I'm saying is,

00:03:31.026 --> 00:03:34.090
I think stress impacts the economy
by reducing productivity

00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:35.737
and increasing health care costs.

00:03:35.761 --> 00:03:36.911
Makes sense?

00:03:37.498 --> 00:03:38.656
Right?

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.926
But here's what doesn't.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.471
Current research from
the World Health Organization

00:03:42.495 --> 00:03:46.720
puts global spending on health
at 7.8 trillion dollars.

00:03:47.696 --> 00:03:49.934
Research from the Global
Wellness Institute

00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:54.085
suggests that the 4.5-trillion-dollar
global wellness industry

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.988
grew from 3.7 to 4.2 trillion
between 2015 and 2017,

00:03:59.012 --> 00:04:01.297
and sees that growth into 2022.

00:04:02.004 --> 00:04:03.742
So what, why do you care?

00:04:03.766 --> 00:04:07.143
Because that growth is nearly
twice as fast as the global economy,

00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:10.024
averaging about 3.3 percent
in the same period.

00:04:10.048 --> 00:04:11.683
So what does all that mean?

00:04:11.707 --> 00:04:14.119
Every year, we're spending
more per year on health,

00:04:14.143 --> 00:04:16.945
and the industries all about
developing overall well-being

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:18.585
and living a healthier lifestyle

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.379
are growing almost twice as fast
as the global economy,

00:04:21.403 --> 00:04:25.010
and yet, we're losing
trillions of dollars per year in output.

00:04:26.329 --> 00:04:27.597
So what's up?

00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:28.844
(Laughter)

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:30.193
Well, stress levels are up,

00:04:30.217 --> 00:04:31.908
and I believe that needs to change.

00:04:31.932 --> 00:04:34.861
I also believe the way we think
about stress needs to change.

00:04:34.885 --> 00:04:36.849
So let's try by reframing how we view it.

00:04:36.873 --> 00:04:39.983
See, we tend to think about stress
as a consequence,

00:04:40.007 --> 00:04:41.801
but I see it as a culture.

00:04:41.825 --> 00:04:43.738
Where do most of us spend our time?

00:04:43.762 --> 00:04:45.499
At work, right?

00:04:45.523 --> 00:04:48.558
Where we face that scale of finding
that work-life balance.

00:04:48.582 --> 00:04:52.185
So the bonds between work,
stress, health and wellness

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:53.407
have never been closer.

00:04:53.431 --> 00:04:55.479
And yet, there's a massive disconnect

00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:58.526
in how we approach stress
and well-being in the workplace.

00:04:58.842 --> 00:05:00.938
And we could blame many things, right?

00:05:00.962 --> 00:05:02.462
New tech,

00:05:02.486 --> 00:05:05.160
laser focus on shareholder returns,

00:05:05.184 --> 00:05:07.390
or my favorite, keeping up
with the Joneses

00:05:07.414 --> 00:05:09.215
and taking pictures while we try.

00:05:09.665 --> 00:05:10.926
But at the end of the day,

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.918
I'm afraid that we've created a culture

00:05:12.942 --> 00:05:16.228
where personal care and overall well-being
are given the back seat.

00:05:16.252 --> 00:05:17.881
So how do we move forward?

00:05:17.905 --> 00:05:20.936
I believe the answer lies
in three fundamental pillars.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.698
And if you find yourselves thinking,

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:25.667
"Rob, I've heard this before,
tell me something I don't know,"

00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:26.842
ask yourself,

00:05:26.866 --> 00:05:29.012
if we already know what to do,

00:05:29.036 --> 00:05:31.146
then what have we been doing?

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.138
First, corporations.

00:05:33.162 --> 00:05:36.940
Specifically, how a corporation's
culture and communication style

00:05:36.964 --> 00:05:40.012
play a pivotal role in the stress
and well-being of a workplace.

00:05:40.036 --> 00:05:42.689
The DNA of a company
is its culture, right?

00:05:42.713 --> 00:05:43.870
It sets the tone,

00:05:43.894 --> 00:05:46.216
even goes as far as defining the company.

00:05:46.767 --> 00:05:48.466
But I think companies should invest

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.362
in the overall mental, physical
and emotional well-being

00:05:51.386 --> 00:05:52.569
of their employees

00:05:52.593 --> 00:05:55.537
the way they invest
in innovation, R and D, right?

00:05:55.561 --> 00:05:58.910
And do I think that this would increase
productivity and reduce stress?

00:05:58.934 --> 00:06:00.092
I really do.

00:06:00.116 --> 00:06:01.649
But for it to really stick,

00:06:01.673 --> 00:06:03.704
a company has to figure out a way

00:06:03.728 --> 00:06:06.515
to measure the overall
well-being of its employees

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.299
with the same accuracy and precision
that they project growth and earnings.

00:06:10.323 --> 00:06:12.798
And if this sounds
like a tall order, ask yourself

00:06:12.822 --> 00:06:16.449
what really is a company's
most competitive advantage.

00:06:16.473 --> 00:06:17.631
Its people.

00:06:17.655 --> 00:06:18.813
We know this.

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:21.886
And just like anything in a company,
it has to start at the top.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.109
So if you're a leader,

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:25.522
openly showing how you care
for your mental health

00:06:25.546 --> 00:06:26.776
and overall well-being

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.069
is a huge catalyst.

00:06:28.093 --> 00:06:29.664
It's no secret I'm a soccer fan,

00:06:29.688 --> 00:06:31.641
so growing up, I had a couple of coaches.

00:06:31.665 --> 00:06:34.641
And I always had one who would lead
the heavy cardio workouts.

00:06:34.665 --> 00:06:36.981
He would not stand
on the side and spectate.

00:06:37.005 --> 00:06:38.188
He would participate.

00:06:38.212 --> 00:06:39.506
And that did three things.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.489
It made it difficult for me to complain.

00:06:41.513 --> 00:06:42.624
(Laughter)

00:06:42.648 --> 00:06:44.704
I always made sure to keep up,

00:06:44.728 --> 00:06:47.045
and I always felt more dialed in
to the exercise.

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:48.252
It's the same idea.

00:06:48.276 --> 00:06:49.704
And finally, communication.

00:06:49.728 --> 00:06:53.172
In order for me to really help my clients
achieve their financial goals,

00:06:53.196 --> 00:06:56.291
requires that I actively
listen and then respond.

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:59.041
Let your employees tell you
what stresses them out.

00:06:59.434 --> 00:07:02.157
Let them tell you
what wellness benefits they need.

00:07:02.517 --> 00:07:03.668
And then act.

00:07:03.692 --> 00:07:05.232
And acting on what they tell you

00:07:05.256 --> 00:07:07.352
will show how serious
you take that feedback,

00:07:07.376 --> 00:07:10.358
and I can't help but feel
the company will win in the long run.

00:07:10.382 --> 00:07:11.548
Why?

00:07:11.572 --> 00:07:15.254
Because properly equipped employees
will be more productive and less stressed.

00:07:15.278 --> 00:07:18.242
Next, I'd like to ask help
from everyone's favorite uncle.

00:07:18.266 --> 00:07:20.933
That's right, the government
has to play a role in this.

00:07:20.957 --> 00:07:24.547
The World Economic Forum
and the Harvard School of Public Health

00:07:24.571 --> 00:07:27.593
estimate that from 2011 to 2030,

00:07:27.617 --> 00:07:29.696
major chronic diseases
and mental illnesses

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.315
will cost the global economy
47 trillion dollars.

00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:34.489
And it's 2020.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.825
Now I'm not saying stress causes
all major chronic diseases,

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:39.024
or all mental illnesses,

00:07:39.048 --> 00:07:40.564
but even if a portion of it is,

00:07:40.588 --> 00:07:42.595
imagine how much lower
that number could be

00:07:42.619 --> 00:07:44.619
if the government did what it does best --

00:07:44.643 --> 00:07:46.172
serve as the enforcer.

00:07:46.196 --> 00:07:49.656
But in this case,
for higher workplace standards.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.395
I don't know, maybe even corporate
tax-incentive programs

00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:53.854
to help raise those standards,

00:07:53.878 --> 00:07:56.942
but the best wellness corporate
policies and initiatives

00:07:56.966 --> 00:07:58.871
backed by a forward-thinking government

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:02.428
won't matter much without help
from the most crucial pillar.

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:03.965
You.

00:08:04.458 --> 00:08:06.847
That's right, stress
and managing it is so dynamic,

00:08:06.871 --> 00:08:08.252
you have to play your part.

00:08:08.276 --> 00:08:10.616
And it's going to benefit
you and the economy.

00:08:11.323 --> 00:08:13.958
Look folks, I'm not a psychologist, OK?

00:08:13.982 --> 00:08:16.537
But I have taken steps
to develop my own mental health

00:08:16.561 --> 00:08:17.791
and overall well-being,

00:08:17.815 --> 00:08:19.298
so here's my last two cents.

00:08:19.729 --> 00:08:21.951
I think a crucial first step
is for everyone

00:08:21.975 --> 00:08:23.712
is to be honest with themselves.

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:24.918
About what?

00:08:24.942 --> 00:08:27.784
About putting your mental,
physical and emotional well-being

00:08:27.808 --> 00:08:28.959
in the rear view

00:08:28.983 --> 00:08:30.760
and the damage it has caused.

00:08:30.784 --> 00:08:34.502
Honest about placing public opinion
above self-preservation.

00:08:35.228 --> 00:08:36.495
Think social media.

00:08:36.895 --> 00:08:40.450
Honest about how we define ourselves
and what actually does.

00:08:40.474 --> 00:08:43.331
Sure, your career contributes
to a portion of who you are.

00:08:43.355 --> 00:08:46.149
But are we allowing it
to define us just a little too much?

00:08:46.173 --> 00:08:47.339
And ask,

00:08:47.363 --> 00:08:50.761
"Is this bringing me the value I saw
with what it costs me?"

00:08:51.307 --> 00:08:53.125
And I don't just mean the dollars.

00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:56.498
For me, being honest meant to get
a good, hard look at my relationship

00:08:56.522 --> 00:08:58.518
with my thoughts, courage and failure.

00:08:58.542 --> 00:09:01.121
Started years ago in this
tournament championship game,

00:09:01.145 --> 00:09:03.062
coach comes to me and says, "Rob Cooke,

00:09:03.086 --> 00:09:05.110
you step up, we can't lose today."

00:09:05.134 --> 00:09:06.569
So I stepped up.

00:09:06.593 --> 00:09:07.775
Failed.

00:09:07.799 --> 00:09:08.965
We lost.

00:09:08.989 --> 00:09:10.196
(Laughter)

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:11.553
Thanks for laughing.

00:09:11.577 --> 00:09:12.799
(Laughter)

00:09:12.823 --> 00:09:13.973
Feels good.

00:09:14.363 --> 00:09:15.513
No, but ...

00:09:16.776 --> 00:09:19.791
You know, after that,
it stayed with me for a while,

00:09:19.815 --> 00:09:22.229
to the point where any
opportunity to step up,

00:09:22.253 --> 00:09:23.871
grow, develop,

00:09:23.895 --> 00:09:25.895
I'd quietly bow my head,

00:09:25.919 --> 00:09:27.332
step back.

00:09:27.356 --> 00:09:29.236
And then I discovered mindfulness.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.196
And I continued to develop it
in my daily life to this day.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.490
To live in the present, the now.

00:09:35.585 --> 00:09:37.982
Now I get it, mindfulness
may not be for everyone,

00:09:38.006 --> 00:09:41.269
but when I think of some of the most
successful and impactful people,

00:09:41.293 --> 00:09:42.466
I see a common trend.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:43.934
Mastery of their mental game.

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.585
Which includes stress management.

00:09:45.609 --> 00:09:47.823
It's all about developing awareness,

00:09:47.847 --> 00:09:49.371
acknowledgment and acceptance

00:09:49.395 --> 00:09:52.856
of your current thoughts, emotions,
environment and physical state.

00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:55.100
Right?

00:09:55.124 --> 00:09:57.474
Now I didn't say never facing stress.

00:09:57.498 --> 00:09:59.213
But the management of that stress --

00:09:59.237 --> 00:10:02.506
that's the benefit,
again, for you and the economy.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.672
I'll leave you with this thought.

00:10:04.696 --> 00:10:08.498
We all know that retirement
is all about saving more now

00:10:08.522 --> 00:10:09.926
for later.

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.720
What if we treated our mental health
and overall well-being

00:10:12.744 --> 00:10:13.903
in the same capacity?

00:10:13.927 --> 00:10:16.863
Develop and save more of you now

00:10:16.887 --> 00:10:18.117
for later in life.

00:10:18.141 --> 00:10:19.728
Doing nothing means more cost,

00:10:19.752 --> 00:10:22.069
and worse, less time.

00:10:22.093 --> 00:10:23.662
And of the two,

00:10:23.686 --> 00:10:25.490
which can't you get back?

00:10:25.514 --> 00:10:28.022
So let's start moving
this culture of stress forward,

00:10:28.046 --> 00:10:29.770
and start living happier, healthier

00:10:29.794 --> 00:10:31.905
and hopefully, more productive lives.

00:10:31.929 --> 00:10:33.080
Thank you.

00:10:33.104 --> 00:10:37.468
(Applause)
