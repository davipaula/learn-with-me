00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.296
A few years ago,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.816
I got a call from the highest ranking
legal official in the state of Georgia:

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.696
the attorney general.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.200
That moment was a wake-up call.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.335
It was 2013, and the city of Atlanta

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.136
was hosting the Final Four
basketball tournament.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.656
The AG called to ask

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.216
if the company that I worked for
could help sponsor billboards

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.176
that would be put up around the city

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.920
as part of an anti-human
trafficking campaign.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.256
He said this was important
because sex trafficking spikes

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.536
with big sporting events
and with conventions.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.040
And the billboards
would help to raise awareness.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.096
Now, if I'm being honest with you,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.616
my first inclination
was to politely decline.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.656
(Laughter)

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.936
Let's face it --

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.056
there are thousands of things that
corporate America could get involved in.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.360
Sex trafficking seemed a little messy.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.256
Little bit too difficult,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.720
something that is better
left for someone else.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.496
But then I started to understand and learn
how big the problem really is.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.880
And that it's rampant
in my company's home town.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.896
I lived and worked in Atlanta for years.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.336
I practice law here.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.536
And yet, I had no idea
that the birthplace of my children

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.720
is among the most prevalent cities
for sex trafficking in the US.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.256
At last report,
Atlanta's illegal sex trade

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.440
has generated up to
290 million dollars a year.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.120
That's more money that the city's
illegal gun and drug trade combined.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.536
So we stepped up
and we helped with the billboards.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.256
But I couldn't help feeling
like it wasn't enough.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.320
The parent in me, the mother in me
needed to do more.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.656
I started talking to people about this

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.536
and inevitably, I was surprised,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.216
because the conversation
would turn from curiosity:

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.016
"Really? This happens here?"

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.440
to empathy: "Wow, we've got
to do something about that."

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:27.616
To blame: "You're not telling me that
every prostitute is a victim, are you?

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.616
I mean, don't they know
what they're getting into?"

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.176
I get it, I understand
why people are confused.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.616
So, to be clear,
the people that I'm talking about

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.456
do not choose this life.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.136
They're forced, defrauded or coerced.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.296
That's actually the legal definition

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.896
for human trafficking
under federal law, for adults.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.056
Now, when it comes to kids,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.776
any minor under 18 that's transported,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.936
facilitated or used for commercial sex,

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.896
is automatically a victim.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.080
Regardless of whether
force, fraud or coercion is used.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.056
This crime knows no age,
gender or socioeconomic barrier.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.416
I'm talking about the 16-year-old girl
that I met in Washington, DC.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.336
She had been trafficked
from the time she was 14 until she was 16.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.656
She was a victim
of the foster care system.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.280
And she told me she'd been sold
up to five times a day.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.616
She didn't even know
the term "human trafficking;"

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.400
she thought that it was just
a part of her life as a foster care kid.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.256
Sex trafficking also shows up
in affluent areas and gated communities.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.616
And men lure young girls
into sex trafficking situations

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.656
with promises of modeling
contracts, cell phones.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.240
Sometimes they're just kidnapped
right off the street.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.656
In the US, an estimated
200,000 to 300,000 girls and boys

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.656
are anticipated to be used
for commercial sex trafficking every year.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.616
You heard that right -- girls and boys.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.296
Worldwide, the International
Labor Organization

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.736
estimates that up to
one million children a year

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.496
are vulnerable for sex trafficking.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.816
Those numbers are huge.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.495
And so while the billboards are great
for raising awareness generally,

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:32.016
they're just not enough
to put an end to this problem.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.456
I believe that if we're going to be
serious about sex trafficking,

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.896
we can't legislate or arrest our way
out of modern-day slavery.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.216
If we really want to end
sex trafficking in the US,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.736
we have to systematically educate
and target demand.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.856
And I think the business community
is in the perfect position

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.640
to do just that.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.896
So, sex trafficking is big business.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.400
And I'm proposing a business plan
that starts with the customer.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.856
And in the sex trade,
the customer is referred to as a John.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.120
He is the man that fuels the demand
for sex trafficking.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.536
Johns do not fit into neat stereotypes.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.176
But there is one universal truth:

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.160
no John, no buyer, no victim.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.496
So if we want to start
to put a dent in sex trafficking,

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.896
we have to get to John.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.720
And businesses can do that
while he's at work.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.016
There's an organization called
Businesses Ending Slavery and Trafficking,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.776
or BEST for short.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.136
And when they launched in 2012,

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.296
they did a study of Seattle-based Johns.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.920
And you know what they found out?

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.960
Johns are everyday guys,
employed at local businesses.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.000
They range in age from 18 to 84.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.640
Johns are dads.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.136
Johns have admitted that they buy sex
when they are traveling for business,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.616
when they're going to sporting events

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.280
or when they're in the military.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.440
But here's the kicker.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.056
BEST study determined
that web-based sex buying

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.880
spikes at 2pm in the afternoon.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.480
Which means that these Johns are likely
buying sex in the middle of the workday.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:39.616
I believe that there is a way to stop
Johns in the middle of the workday

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.256
from buying sex.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.416
And businesses can do it
in three simple ways.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.056
The first is with a policy.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.976
A policy that clearly says,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.416
the company prohibits
sex-buying during work,

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.120
with company resources or on company time.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.176
That's right.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.296
I'm saying that your handbook
has to specifically give an example

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.656
that says no sex-buying
while you're traveling,

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.760
at the international trade show,
because that's where it's happening.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.976
Now, a policy is only as good
as its enforcement and its communication.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.576
Several studies have indicated from Johns

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:25.936
that the best way to deter them
is public humiliation and embarrassment.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.736
So, businesses who catch Johns buying sex,

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.536
using company-based equipment
or company resources,

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.816
but cut them a break
or sweep it under the rug

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.656
and don't fire them,

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.640
are complicit in fueling demand.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.256
Now, a policy is one
of the best ways to start.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.080
The second way is educating the workforce.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.576
Businesses can go a long way
in simply training their workforce

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.056
about the signs and the red flags
of human trafficking.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.416
This was my "aha!" moment for how
our company could make a big difference.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.816
Our nation's highways,
airports and truck stops

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.280
are literally used
as modern-day slave routes.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.216
Our company has more than 100,000 drivers

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.256
all over the country, all over the world.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.416
And so it made perfect sense
to train them to see the red flags.

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.856
We don't want them jumping out there
and doing things on their own,

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.096
so we want them to call
a phone number, the hotline,

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.160
and let law enforcement intervene.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.136
So to do this, we teamed up

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:39.656
with an organization
called Truckers Against Trafficking.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:45.176
This Colorado-based organization
had web-based support and materials

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.336
that we gave to our truck drivers

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.456
that gave them exactly what they needed
to spot the red flags.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:57.280
Like, hearing CB chatter on their radios
about girls at nearby exits.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:02.456
Or, seeing underaged women
emerging from vehicles

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.560
in the truck stop parking lots.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.576
When we rolled out this training,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.576
a few brave drivers admitted
they had seen these women,

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:17.656
knocking on the cabs in the truck stops,
looking for customers.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.776
Now, they said that they weren't buying.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.216
But they also didn't know
enough to make a call.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.040
And that's what we want them to do.

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.776
TAT's organization --
Truckers Against Trafficking --

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:35.536
also emphasizes the need
for men to talk to other men

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.336
about web-based sex buying
and not buying commercial sex.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:44.096
They feature men in uniform,
proudly proclaiming why they don't buy.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.936
If we're going to see
a cultural shift in this atrocity,

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.536
we need men talking to other men

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.016
about the underlying issues
fueling demand.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.416
Because sometimes, Johns don't even know

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.960
that they're purchasing girls
who are enslaved.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.216
Which brings me to my final way
that businesses can help.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.656
Every business has a special resource

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:10.856
or a secret sauce or resource
that they can bring

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.216
to fight human trafficking.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.936
For example, Visa, Master Card
and American Express

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.736
refuse to process transactions
from backpage.com,

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.416
an online sex site
that sold commercial sex

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.040
to the tune of nine
million dollars a month.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.616
In April of 2018, backpage.com
and affiliated websites were shut down,

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.880
and the FBI seized all their assets.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.520
Hiring survivors is another way
that any company can help.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.496
Randstad, an organization
that works with companies

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.976
to find survivors who need good jobs,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.536
has an excellent program,
called Hire Hope.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:55.216
We've used this program;
we know that it works.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.456
In addition to training
their flight attendants

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.136
and their airline crew,

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.936
Delta Air Lines also offers SkyMiles,
through a program called SkyWish,

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.536
to survivors to help them
escape their traffickers

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.520
and reunite with their families.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.016
There are thousands of things
that businesses can do.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.960
They just have to decide
what to do to join the fight.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.296
No one can justify slavery today.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:27.336
But I believe it remains one
of the greatest civil rights atrocities

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.560
of our time.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.656
Fortunately, the business community
is uniquely positioned

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.080
to help train their employees,

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.216
to enforce policies

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.056
and to help use their special resources

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.960
to fight human trafficking.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.296
And what about you?

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.016
What if you decided
to learn the red flags?

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.616
What if you decided to look
at the signs that are all around you

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.840
and make a call?

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.656
There is no penalty
for calling law enforcement

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.040
when you see something
that doesn't sit right.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.720
Together, we can all protect our children,

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.736
we can educate the workforces around us

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.616
and improve society,

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:21.680
where we all live and work with John.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.016
Thank you.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.760
(Applause)
