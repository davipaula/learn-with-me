00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.317
(Imitates fishing cat)

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:20.135
That's my impersonation of a fishing cat,

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:23.412
which actually sounds more like this.

00:00:24.696 --> 00:00:27.323
(Prerecorded fishing cat sounds)

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:32.736
It's a cat that loves water,

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.228
loves to fish,

00:00:34.252 --> 00:00:39.529
and lives in some of the most unique
and valuable ecosystems on earth:

00:00:39.553 --> 00:00:43.629
the wetlands and mangrove forests
of South and Southeast Asia.

00:00:43.653 --> 00:00:45.399
Aren't they fishing awesome?

00:00:45.423 --> 00:00:47.764
(Laughter)

00:00:47.788 --> 00:00:51.010
Fishing cats are one of about 40
species of wildcats.

00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:54.055
Like tigers and lions, only much smaller.

00:00:54.434 --> 00:00:57.855
They're probably around twice the size
of our average domestic cat.

00:00:58.268 --> 00:00:59.490
In Indonesia,

00:00:59.514 --> 00:01:01.593
people call them "kucing bakau,"

00:01:01.617 --> 00:01:05.315
which literally translates
to "the cat of the mangroves."

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.736
But I like to call them
the tigers of the mangroves.

00:01:09.378 --> 00:01:13.061
Now, we don't know fishing cats
as well as we do tigers,

00:01:13.085 --> 00:01:17.182
but what we've learned is that these cats
can be a flagship species

00:01:17.206 --> 00:01:19.769
to a globally important ecosystem,

00:01:19.793 --> 00:01:25.015
and a visual bait attached
to a strong line for conservation.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.793
Are you hooked yet?

00:01:26.817 --> 00:01:28.142
(Laughter)

00:01:28.876 --> 00:01:30.718
Like many endangered species,

00:01:30.742 --> 00:01:33.526
fishing cats are threatened
by habitat loss,

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.907
mainly because of our international demand
for farmed fish and shrimp,

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:42.122
and the deforestation
of nearly half the historic mangrove cover

00:01:42.146 --> 00:01:44.013
in South and Southeast Asia.

00:01:44.615 --> 00:01:46.179
Mangroves, on the other hand,

00:01:46.203 --> 00:01:48.980
are much more than just habitat
to the fishing cat.

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:52.641
They are home to a fantastic
array of species,

00:01:52.665 --> 00:01:54.458
like jackals,

00:01:54.482 --> 00:01:56.022
turtles,

00:01:56.046 --> 00:01:57.752
shorebirds

00:01:57.776 --> 00:01:59.760
and otters.

00:01:59.784 --> 00:02:00.886
(Laughter)

00:02:01.633 --> 00:02:03.830
Mangroves also prevent soil erosion,

00:02:03.854 --> 00:02:09.037
and they can be the first line of defense
between storm surges, tsunamis

00:02:09.061 --> 00:02:12.315
and the millions of people
who live next to these forests

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:14.339
for their day-to-day survival.

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:17.252
The fact that puts
the icing on the cake --

00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:19.077
or the earth, I should say --

00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:20.616
is that mangroves can store

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.347
upwards of five to ten times
more carbon dioxide

00:02:24.371 --> 00:02:25.838
than tropical forests.

00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:28.919
So protecting one acre of mangroves

00:02:28.943 --> 00:02:33.823
may well be like protecting five
or more acres of tropical forests.

00:02:34.744 --> 00:02:38.855
Would you like to eliminate
you entire life's carbon footprint?

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.091
Well, mangroves can offer you

00:02:41.115 --> 00:02:44.448
one of the best bangs
for your conservation buck.

00:02:45.641 --> 00:02:48.744
Deforestation, extinction
and climate change

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:51.704
are all global problems that we can solve

00:02:51.728 --> 00:02:55.371
by giving value
to our species and ecosystems

00:02:55.395 --> 00:02:57.601
and by working together
with the local people

00:02:57.625 --> 00:02:59.092
who live next to them.

00:02:59.704 --> 00:03:04.371
This is one of three river deltas
in coastal South India

00:03:04.395 --> 00:03:06.260
where communities came together

00:03:06.284 --> 00:03:10.077
to change the face and potentially,
the fate of this planet.

00:03:10.641 --> 00:03:12.054
In less than a decade,

00:03:12.078 --> 00:03:14.283
with international support,

00:03:14.307 --> 00:03:17.752
the state forest departments
and the local communities

00:03:17.776 --> 00:03:20.198
worked together to restore

00:03:20.222 --> 00:03:25.171
over 20,000 acres
of unproductive fish and shrimp farms

00:03:25.195 --> 00:03:27.085
back into mangroves.

00:03:28.134 --> 00:03:30.396
About five years ago,

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.070
guess who we discovered
in these restored mangroves?

00:03:36.997 --> 00:03:41.363
When we shared images
of these fishing cats with local people,

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:43.506
we were able to build pride among them

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.462
about a globally revered
endangered species and ecosystem

00:03:47.486 --> 00:03:48.819
in their backyards.

00:03:49.342 --> 00:03:52.246
We were also able to build trust
with some people

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.953
to help them lead alternative livelihoods.

00:03:54.977 --> 00:03:57.289
Meet Santosh, a 19-year-old boy

00:03:57.313 --> 00:04:00.067
who not only became
a conservation professional

00:04:00.091 --> 00:04:02.416
after working with us
for just over a year

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.281
but also went on to involve
many local fishermen

00:04:05.305 --> 00:04:08.105
in helping study and protect fishing cats.

00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:11.505
Meet Moshi, a tribal poacher,

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:12.886
who not only stopped hunting

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.910
and became our most
prized conservationist,

00:04:15.934 --> 00:04:18.386
but also used his traditional knowledge

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.055
to educate his entire community
to stop hunting fishing cats, otters

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:24.848
and the many other threatened species

00:04:24.872 --> 00:04:28.117
that live in the mangroves
in his backyard.

00:04:28.141 --> 00:04:30.632
Fish and shrimp farmers, like Venkat,

00:04:30.656 --> 00:04:33.683
are now willing to work
with us conservationists

00:04:33.707 --> 00:04:38.569
to test the sustainable harvest
of ecosystem services like crabs,

00:04:38.593 --> 00:04:41.387
and possibly even honey, from mangroves.

00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:45.577
Incentives that could get them
to protect and plant mangroves

00:04:45.601 --> 00:04:47.334
where they have been lost.

00:04:47.982 --> 00:04:49.759
A win-win-win

00:04:49.783 --> 00:04:54.247
for fishing cats, local people
and the global community.

00:04:55.485 --> 00:04:58.732
These stories show us
that we can all be part of a future

00:04:58.756 --> 00:05:02.279
where fishing cats
and the lost mangrove forests

00:05:02.303 --> 00:05:06.174
are protected and restored
by fishermen themselves,

00:05:06.198 --> 00:05:08.071
creating carbon sinks

00:05:08.095 --> 00:05:11.737
that can help offset
our ecological footprints.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.871
So while the fishing cat may be small,

00:05:14.895 --> 00:05:19.045
I hope that we've been able
to help make it a big deal.

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:20.895
One that we can all invest in

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.118
to help sustain our lives
on earth a little longer.

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:28.116
Or as our friend here would say ...

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:31.642
(Prerecorded fishing cat sounds)

00:05:32.151 --> 00:05:33.301
Thank you.

00:05:33.325 --> 00:05:38.253
(Applause)
