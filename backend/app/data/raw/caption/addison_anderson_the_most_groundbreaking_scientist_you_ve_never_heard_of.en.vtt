00:00:07.114 --> 00:00:09.163
Nicolas Steno is rarely heard of

00:00:09.163 --> 00:00:11.436
outside Intro to Geology,

00:00:11.436 --> 00:00:14.245
but anyone hoping to understand life on Earth

00:00:14.245 --> 00:00:17.174
should see how Steno expanded and connected

00:00:17.174 --> 00:00:18.675
those very concepts:

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:21.758
Earth, life, and understanding.

00:00:21.758 --> 00:00:25.226
Born Niels Stensen in 1638 Denmark,

00:00:25.226 --> 00:00:26.813
son of a goldsmith,

00:00:26.813 --> 00:00:28.139
he was a sickly kid

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:30.642
whose school chums died of plague.

00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:32.559
He survived to cut up corpses

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:33.726
as an anatomist,

00:00:33.726 --> 00:00:36.357
studying organs shared across species.

00:00:36.357 --> 00:00:38.249
He found a duct in animal skulls

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:40.227
that sends saliva to the mouth.

00:00:40.227 --> 00:00:41.728
He refuted Descartes' idea

00:00:41.728 --> 00:00:43.862
that only humans had a pineal gland,

00:00:43.862 --> 00:00:46.113
proving it wasn't the seat of the soul,

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:48.942
arguably, the debut of neuroscience.

00:00:48.942 --> 00:00:51.949
Most remarkable for the time was his method.

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.200
Steno never let ancient texts,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.708
Aristotelian metaphysics,

00:00:55.708 --> 00:00:57.503
or Cartesian deductions

00:00:57.503 --> 00:01:01.173
overrule empirical, experimental evidence.

00:01:01.173 --> 00:01:05.131
His vision, uncluttered by speculation or rationalization,

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:06.060
went deep.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.673
Steno had seen how gallstones

00:01:07.673 --> 00:01:10.426
form in wet organs by accretion.

00:01:10.426 --> 00:01:11.768
They obeyed molding principles

00:01:11.768 --> 00:01:13.556
he knew from the goldsmith trade,

00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:15.155
rules useful across disciplines

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:16.739
for understanding solids

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:18.771
by their structural relationships.

00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:20.310
Later, the Grand Duke of Tuscany

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.977
had him dissect a shark.

00:01:21.977 --> 00:01:23.890
Its teeth resembled tongue stones,

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.393
odd rocks seen inside other rocks

00:01:26.393 --> 00:01:28.979
in Malta and the mountains near Florence.

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.203
Pliny the Elder, old Roman naturalist,

00:01:31.203 --> 00:01:33.530
said these fell from the sky.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.703
In the Dark Ages,

00:01:34.703 --> 00:01:36.493
folks said they were snake tongues,

00:01:36.493 --> 00:01:38.254
petrified by Saint Paul.

00:01:38.254 --> 00:01:41.058
Steno saw that tongue stones were shark teeth

00:01:41.058 --> 00:01:42.393
and vice versa,

00:01:42.393 --> 00:01:45.003
with the same signs of structural growth.

00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:47.757
Figuring similar things are made in similar ways,

00:01:47.757 --> 00:01:49.396
he argued the ancient teeth

00:01:49.396 --> 00:01:50.877
came from ancient sharks

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:53.679
in waters that formed rock around the teeth

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.420
and became mountains.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.637
Rock layers were once layers of watery sediment,

00:01:58.637 --> 00:02:00.280
which would lay out horizontally,

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.390
one atop another,

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.197
oldest up to newest.

00:02:03.197 --> 00:02:04.679
If layers were deformed,

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:05.199
tilted,

00:02:05.199 --> 00:02:07.164
cut by a fault or a canyon,

00:02:07.164 --> 00:02:09.487
that change came after the layer formed.

00:02:09.487 --> 00:02:10.779
Sounds simple today;

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:12.998
back then, revolutionary.

00:02:12.998 --> 00:02:14.660
He'd invented stratigraphy

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.113
and laid geology's ground work.

00:02:17.744 --> 00:02:21.734
By finding one origin for shark teeth from two eras

00:02:21.734 --> 00:02:24.631
by stating natural laws ruling the present

00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:26.628
also ruled the past,

00:02:26.628 --> 00:02:30.134
Steno planted seeds for uniformitarianism,

00:02:30.134 --> 00:02:33.091
the idea that the past was shaped by processes

00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:34.798
observable today.

00:02:34.798 --> 00:02:36.754
In the 18th and 19th centuries,

00:02:36.754 --> 00:02:39.255
English uniformitarian geologists,

00:02:39.255 --> 00:02:41.468
James Hutton and Charles Lyell,

00:02:41.468 --> 00:02:43.972
studied current, very slow rates

00:02:43.972 --> 00:02:46.014
of erosion and sedimentation

00:02:46.014 --> 00:02:48.190
and realized the Earth had to be way older

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.308
than the biblical guestimate, 6000 years.

00:02:51.308 --> 00:02:53.316
Out of their work came the rock cycle,

00:02:53.316 --> 00:02:55.056
which combined with plate tectonics

00:02:55.056 --> 00:02:56.436
in the mid-twentieth century

00:02:56.436 --> 00:02:58.907
to give us the great molten-crusting, quaking,

00:02:58.907 --> 00:03:01.483
all-encircling theory of the Earth,

00:03:01.483 --> 00:03:05.556
from a gallstone to a 4.5 billion-year-old planet.

00:03:05.556 --> 00:03:06.907
Now think bigger,

00:03:06.907 --> 00:03:08.022
take it to biology.

00:03:08.022 --> 00:03:10.160
Say you see shark teeth in one layer

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.539
and a fossil of an organism

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:13.188
you've never seen under that.

00:03:13.188 --> 00:03:15.447
The deeper fossil's older, yes?

00:03:15.447 --> 00:03:16.502
You now have evidence

00:03:16.502 --> 00:03:19.707
of the origin and extinction of species over time.

00:03:19.707 --> 00:03:21.171
Get uniformitarian.

00:03:21.171 --> 00:03:23.350
Maybe a process still active today

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.844
caused changes not just in rocks but in life.

00:03:26.844 --> 00:03:28.982
It might also explain similarities and differences

00:03:28.982 --> 00:03:30.421
between species

00:03:30.421 --> 00:03:32.621
found by anatomists like Steno.

00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:33.729
It's a lot to ponder,

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:36.269
but Charles Darwin had the time

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.902
on a long trip to the Galapagos,

00:03:37.902 --> 00:03:40.467
reading a copy of his friend Charles Lyell's

00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:42.323
"Principles of Geology,"

00:03:42.323 --> 00:03:44.496
which Steno sort of founded.

00:03:44.496 --> 00:03:46.530
Sometimes giants stand on the shoulders

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.529
of curious little people.

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:50.882
Nicolas Steno helped evolve evolution,

00:03:50.882 --> 00:03:52.431
broke ground for geology,

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:55.041
and showed how unbiased, empirical observation

00:03:55.041 --> 00:03:56.890
can cut across intellectual borders

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.936
to deepen our perspective.

00:03:58.936 --> 00:04:00.752
His finest accomplishment, though,

00:04:00.752 --> 00:04:01.882
may be his maxim,

00:04:01.882 --> 00:04:03.189
casting the search for truth

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:05.719
beyond our senses and our current understanding

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:07.284
as the pursuit of the beauty

00:04:07.284 --> 00:04:09.476
of the as yet unknown.

00:04:09.476 --> 00:04:11.443
Beautiful is what we see,

00:04:11.443 --> 00:04:13.694
more beautiful is what we know,

00:04:13.694 --> 00:04:17.274
most beautiful, by far, is what we don't.
