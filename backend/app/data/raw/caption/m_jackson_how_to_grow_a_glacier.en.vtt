00:00:06.904 --> 00:00:08.444
In the 13th Century,

00:00:08.444 --> 00:00:12.474
Genghis Khan embarked on a mission
to take over Eurasia,

00:00:12.474 --> 00:00:18.234
swiftly conquering countries and drawing 
them into his expanding Mongol Empire.

00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:21.761
With his vast armies he became almost 
unstoppable.

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:24.501
But, legend has it that there was 
one obstacle

00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:27.761
that even the impressive Khan couldn’t 
overcome:

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.101
A towering wall of ice,

00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:33.161
grown by locals across a mountain pass

00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:36.961
to stop the Khan’s armies from 
invading their territory.

00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:41.431
No one knows how historically accurate 
that particular story is,

00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:44.375
but remarkably, it draws on fact:

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:48.305
For centuries, in the Karakoram 
and Himalayan mountain ranges,

00:00:48.305 --> 00:00:52.705
people have been growing glaciers 
and using these homemade bodies of ice

00:00:52.705 --> 00:00:56.665
as sources of drinking water and 
irrigation for their crops.

00:00:56.665 --> 00:00:59.385
But before we get to that fascinating 
phenomenon,

00:00:59.385 --> 00:01:01.955
it’s important to understand the 
difference between

00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:04.085
glaciers that grow in the wild,

00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:06.475
and those that humans create.

00:01:06.475 --> 00:01:07.375
In the wild,

00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:10.105
glaciers require three conditions to grow:

00:01:10.105 --> 00:01:13.855
Snowfall, cold temperatures, and time.

00:01:13.855 --> 00:01:17.375
First, a great deal of snow falls and 
accumulates.

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:20.235
Cold temperatures then ensure that the 
stacked up snow

00:01:20.235 --> 00:01:24.325
persists throughout the winter, spring, 
summer, and fall.

00:01:24.325 --> 00:01:27.522
Over the following years, decades, 
and centuries,

00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:29.732
the pressure of the accumulated snow

00:01:29.732 --> 00:01:34.642
transforms layers into highly compacted 
glacial ice.

00:01:34.642 --> 00:01:36.460
Artificially growing a glacier,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.630
however, is completely different.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.880
At the confluence of three great 
mountain ranges,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.150
the Himalayas, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.190
some local cultures have believed for
centuries that glaciers are alive.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.230
And what’s more,

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.110
that certain glaciers can have different 
genders including male and female.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.305
Local Glacier Growers ‘breed’ new glaciers
by grafting together—or marrying—

00:02:01.305 --> 00:02:04.865
fragments of ice from male and 
female glaciers,

00:02:04.865 --> 00:02:09.905
then covering them with charcoal, 
wheat husks, cloths, or willow branches

00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:11.749
so they can reproduce.

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:13.549
Under their protective coverings,

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.439
these glacierets transform into fully 
active glaciers

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.609
that grow each year with 
additional snowfall.

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.529
Those then serve as lasting 
reserves of water

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:26.959
that farmers can use 
to irrigate their crops.

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.159
These practices have spread 
to other cultures,

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.949
where people are creating their own 
versions of glaciers

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:37.049
and applying them to solve serious 
modern challenges around water supplies.

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.688
Take Ladakh, a high-altitude desert region
in northern India.

00:02:41.688 --> 00:02:44.266
It sits in the rain shadow of the 
Himalayas

00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:48.926
and receives on average fewer than ten 
centimeters of rain per year.

00:02:48.926 --> 00:02:51.755
As local glaciers shrink because 
of climate change,

00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:54.385
regional water scarcity is increasing.

00:02:54.385 --> 00:02:57.805
And so, local people have started growing 
their own glaciers

00:02:57.805 --> 00:03:00.415
as insurance against this uncertainty.

00:03:00.415 --> 00:03:04.815
These glaciers come in two types: 
horizontal, and vertical.

00:03:04.815 --> 00:03:09.255
Horizontal glaciers are formed when 
farmers redirect glacier meltwater

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:11.041
into channels and pipes,

00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:17.161
then carefully siphon it off into a series
of basins made from stones and earth.

00:03:17.161 --> 00:03:21.575
Villagers minutely control the release of 
water into these reservoirs,

00:03:21.575 --> 00:03:23.798
waiting for each new layer to freeze

00:03:23.798 --> 00:03:26.848
before filling the basin 
with another wave.

00:03:26.848 --> 00:03:28.108
In early spring,

00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:30.558
these frozen pools begin to melt,

00:03:30.558 --> 00:03:33.878
supplying villagers with 
irrigation for their fields.

00:03:33.878 --> 00:03:37.188
Local people make vertical glaciers using 
the meltwater

00:03:37.188 --> 00:03:41.368
from already-existing glaciers 
high above their villages.

00:03:41.368 --> 00:03:44.683
The meltwater enters channels 
that run downhill,

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:46.613
flowing until it reaches a crop site

00:03:46.613 --> 00:03:50.873
where it bursts forth from a pipe pointing
straight into the air.

00:03:50.873 --> 00:03:52.663
When winter temperatures dip,

00:03:52.663 --> 00:03:55.783
this water freezes as it arcs 
out of the pipe,

00:03:55.783 --> 00:04:00.263
ultimately forming a 50 meter ice 
sculpture called a stupa,

00:04:00.263 --> 00:04:03.204
shaped like an upside-down ice cream cone.

00:04:03.204 --> 00:04:08.604
This inverted form minimizes the amount
of surface area it exposes to the sun

00:04:08.604 --> 00:04:10.037
in the spring and summer.

00:04:10.037 --> 00:04:13.127
That ensures that the mini-glacier 
melts slowly

00:04:13.127 --> 00:04:18.077
and provides a reliable supply of water 
to feed the farmers’ crops.

00:04:18.077 --> 00:04:19.997
These methods may be ancient,

00:04:19.997 --> 00:04:21.617
but they’re becoming more relevant

00:04:21.617 --> 00:04:24.767
as climate change takes its 
toll on our planet.

00:04:24.767 --> 00:04:30.137
In fact, people are now growing their own
glaciers in many regions beyond Ladakh.

00:04:30.142 --> 00:04:33.632
Swiss people, utilizing modern glacier 
growing technology,

00:04:33.632 --> 00:04:38.082
created their first stupa in 2016 
in the Swiss Alps.

00:04:38.082 --> 00:04:42.326
There are plans for over 100 more in 
villages in Pakistan,

00:04:42.326 --> 00:04:45.335
Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.

00:04:45.335 --> 00:04:49.115
Perhaps one day we’ll be able to harness
our homegrown glaciers

00:04:49.115 --> 00:04:51.895
well enough to build whole walls of ice–

00:04:51.895 --> 00:04:54.285
this time not for keeping people out,

00:04:54.285 --> 00:04:58.705
but to enable life in some of the planet’s
harshest landscapes.
