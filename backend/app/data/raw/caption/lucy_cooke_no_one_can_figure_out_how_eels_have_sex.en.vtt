00:00:06.843 --> 00:00:10.144
From Ancient Greece to the 20th century,

00:00:10.144 --> 00:00:14.244
Aristotle, Sigmund Freud,
and numerous other scholars

00:00:14.244 --> 00:00:17.334
were all looking for the same thing:

00:00:17.334 --> 00:00:19.784
eel testicles.

00:00:19.784 --> 00:00:25.916
Freshwater eels, or Anguilla Anguilla,
could be found in rivers across Europe,

00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:28.896
but no one had ever seen them mate.

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:31.256
And despite countless dissections,

00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:37.726
no researcher could find eel eggs
or identify their reproductive organs.

00:00:37.726 --> 00:00:43.506
Devoid of data, naturalists proposed 
various eel origin stories.

00:00:43.506 --> 00:00:48.757
Aristotle suggested that eels 
spontaneously emerged from mud.

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:53.561
Pliny the Elder argued eels 
rubbed themselves against rocks,

00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:57.391
and the subsequent scrapings 
came to life.

00:00:57.391 --> 00:01:02.748
Eels were said to hatch on rooftops,
manifest from the gills of other fish,

00:01:02.748 --> 00:01:06.736
and even emerge 
from the bodies of beetles.

00:01:06.736 --> 00:01:12.398
But the true story of eel reproduction
is even more difficult to imagine.

00:01:12.398 --> 00:01:15.098
And to solve this slippery mystery,

00:01:15.098 --> 00:01:19.268
scholars would have to rethink 
centuries of research.

00:01:19.268 --> 00:01:25.683
Today, we know the freshwater eel 
lifecycle has five distinct stages:

00:01:25.683 --> 00:01:32.893
larval leptocepheli, miniscule glass eels,
adolescent elvers,

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:37.400
older yellow eels, and adult silver eels.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.320
Given the radical physical differences 
between these phases,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.200
you’d be forgiven for assuming 
these are different animals.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.770
In fact, that’s exactly what 
European naturalists thought.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.184
Researchers were aware of leptocepheli
and glass eels,

00:01:54.184 --> 00:01:58.284
but no one guessed they were related
to the elvers and yellow eels

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:01.144
living hundreds of kilometers upstream.

00:02:01.144 --> 00:02:06.854
Confusing matters more, eels don’t 
develop sex organs until late in life.

00:02:06.854 --> 00:02:09.814
And the entirety of their time 
in the rivers of Europe

00:02:09.814 --> 00:02:12.754
is essentially eel adolescence.

00:02:12.754 --> 00:02:17.879
So when do eels reproduce, 
and where do they do it?

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:23.085
Despite its name, the life 
of a freshwater eel actually begins

00:02:23.085 --> 00:02:26.605
in the salty waters 
of the Bermuda Triangle.

00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:29.305
At the height of the annual 
cyclone season,

00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:32.415
thousands of three-millimeter eel larvae

00:02:32.415 --> 00:02:34.945
drift out of the Sargasso Sea.

00:02:34.945 --> 00:02:39.440
From here, they follow migration 
paths to North America and Europe—

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.520
continents that were 
much closer

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.231
when eels established these routes 
40 million years ago.

00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:52.329
Over the next 300 days, Anguilla Anguilla
larvae ride the ocean currents

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.521
6,500 km to the coast of Europe—

00:02:56.521 --> 00:03:00.669
making one of the longest 
known marine migrations.

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:05.599
By the time they arrive, they’ve grown 
approximately 45 mm,

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.982
and transformed into semi-transparent 
glass eels.

00:03:09.982 --> 00:03:12.412
It’s not just their appearance 
that’s changed.

00:03:12.412 --> 00:03:16.162
If most marine fish entered 
brackish coastal waters,

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:21.180
their cells would swell with freshwater
in a lethal explosion.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.562
But when glass eels reach the coast,

00:03:23.562 --> 00:03:26.440
their kidneys shift to retain more salt

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.190
and maintain their blood’s 
salinity levels.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.469
Swarms of these newly freshwater 
fish migrate up streams and rivers,

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:39.893
sometimes piling on top of each other
to clear obstacles and predators.

00:03:39.893 --> 00:03:44.620
Those that make it upstream develop
into opaque elvers.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.430
Having finally arrived 
in their hunting grounds,

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.430
elvers begin to eat everything 
they can fit into their mouths.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.030
These omnivores grow in proportion
to their diets,

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.863
and over the next decade they develop
into larger yellow eels.

00:03:59.863 --> 00:04:04.388
In this stage, they grow 
to be roughly 80 cm,

00:04:04.388 --> 00:04:07.898
and finally develop sexual organs.

00:04:07.898 --> 00:04:13.481
But the last phase of eel life— 
and the secret of their reproduction—

00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:15.701
remains mysterious.

00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:21.850
In 1896, researchers identified 
leptocepheli as larval eels,

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.089
and deduced that they had come 
to Europe from somewhere in the Atlantic.

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:29.239
However, to find this mysterious 
breeding ground,

00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:32.839
someone would have to perform 
an unthinkable survey of the ocean

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:36.759
for larvae no larger than 30mm.

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:39.095
Enter Johannes Schmidt.

00:04:39.095 --> 00:04:42.699
For the next 18 years, 
this Danish oceanographer

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.339
trawled the coasts of four continents,

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:49.269
hunting down increasingly 
tiny leptocepheli.

00:04:49.269 --> 00:04:53.770
Finally, in 1921, he found 
the smallest larvae yet,

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.010
on the southern edge 
of the Sargasso Sea.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.950
Despite knowledge 
of their round trip migration,

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.340
scientists still haven’t observed 
mating in the wild,

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.893
or found a single eel egg.

00:05:06.893 --> 00:05:09.843
Leading theories suggest 
that eels reproduce

00:05:09.843 --> 00:05:12.913
in a flurry of external fertilization,

00:05:12.913 --> 00:05:17.368
in which clouds of sperm 
fertilize free-floating eggs.

00:05:17.368 --> 00:05:21.588
But the powerful currents 
and tangling seaweed of the Sargasso Sea

00:05:21.588 --> 00:05:24.798
have made this theory 
difficult to confirm.

00:05:24.798 --> 00:05:27.468
Researchers don’t even know where to look,

00:05:27.468 --> 00:05:29.918
since they’ve yet to successfully
track an eel

00:05:29.918 --> 00:05:32.588
over the course of its return migration.

00:05:32.588 --> 00:05:34.998
Until these challenges can be met,

00:05:34.998 --> 00:05:40.502
the eel’s ancient secret will continue
to slip through our fingers.
