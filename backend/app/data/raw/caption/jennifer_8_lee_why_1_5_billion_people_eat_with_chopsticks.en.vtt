00:00:12.092 --> 00:00:14.715
It is such a sort of instrumental part

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.768
of our cooking vocabulary,
in terms of the utensils.

00:00:17.793 --> 00:00:19.606
And it was like, that's interesting,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.773
there are people
who live without chopsticks.

00:00:21.797 --> 00:00:22.811
[Small Thing.]

00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:23.906
[Big Idea.]

00:00:26.917 --> 00:00:29.393
Chopsticks are a pair of two long sticks

00:00:29.417 --> 00:00:31.976
used to eat things with one hand.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.934
Holding chopsticks
is a little bit like holding a pencil,

00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:36.518
except that you have two of them

00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:38.809
and you move them together
in a pincer movement.

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:42.434
Most of them are made out of wood.
They're also made out of plastic, bamboo,

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:44.559
jade, gold, silver and even ivory,

00:00:44.583 --> 00:00:46.768
though I think that's not so cool anymore.

00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:50.143
Chopsticks are really well designed
for eating small bits of food.

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:51.934
They're good for picking up noodles.

00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.768
If you're skilled, you can eat rice,

00:00:53.792 --> 00:00:55.726
pick up dumplings, pieces of meat.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.851
There are some no-nos with chopsticks.

00:00:57.875 --> 00:01:00.226
You should not use
the chopsticks like drumsticks,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.518
which I know is tempting.

00:01:01.542 --> 00:01:04.934
You don't want to stick chopsticks
into a bowl of rice face-up.

00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:08.184
And the reason for that is it actually
looks like a bowl of incense,

00:01:08.208 --> 00:01:09.559
so it sort of echoes death.

00:01:09.583 --> 00:01:12.018
Chopsticks are used
in a huge portion of the world,

00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:14.643
across much of Asia,
about 1.5 billion people

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:16.643
are covered in the chopsticks sphere.

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:20.143
Different cultures have slightly different
variations of chopsticks.

00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:22.851
Chinese chopsticks
will tend to be long and round,

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:25.851
Korean chopsticks
are flatter and often made of metal

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:28.018
and Japanese chopsticks tend to be round

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:29.518
and very, very pointy.

00:01:29.542 --> 00:01:31.851
While chopsticks
are actually really commonplace

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:33.768
in American society today,

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:36.434
there was definitely a time
in the late 1800s

00:01:36.458 --> 00:01:38.684
where this idea that Asian men,

00:01:38.708 --> 00:01:40.726
because they ate rice with sticks,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.559
were of a different quality
than American men,

00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:45.643
who ate proper meat with a knife and fork.

00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:47.809
But when China and the United States

00:01:47.833 --> 00:01:51.309
began their diplomatic
engagement in the 1970s,

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:52.893
Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger,

00:01:52.917 --> 00:01:55.893
had to practice eating with chopsticks.

00:01:55.917 --> 00:01:57.851
What's been really interesting to see

00:01:57.875 --> 00:02:02.976
is that as Asian cuisine has moved
from the East into the West,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.726
chopsticks have become
part of the experience.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.101
There's evidence of chopsticks
as long ago as the Shang dynasty,

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:10.726
which is about 3000 years ago,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.559
and they loved tripods
during the Shang dynasty.

00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:15.809
So when you cook with these big tripods,

00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:17.851
chopsticks were actually really useful,

00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:20.226
because it was a way
for you to stir and to reach

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.226
without getting burned
as the water was boiling

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.226
in these really big pots.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.351
Chinese culture has knives and has forks.

00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:30.143
It uses them in many cases for cooking.

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:34.184
But in terms of like what
moved into the dining room,

00:02:34.208 --> 00:02:35.476
it was the chopsticks.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.309
One of the things about Asian cooking

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:39.601
is that it often comes
in very small pieces.

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:41.934
And I think part of that
has to do with the fact

00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:44.101
that it's actually
a lot more energy-efficient

00:02:44.125 --> 00:02:46.101
to cook little pieces quickly.

00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:48.184
But also, then you don't have to cut them.

00:02:48.208 --> 00:02:49.893
So you have a circular influence,

00:02:49.917 --> 00:02:53.268
where the type of food that is cooked
allows people to use chopsticks,

00:02:53.292 --> 00:02:57.184
and then the fact that you have chopsticks
influences the food that you can cook.

00:02:57.208 --> 00:03:00.809
But at the same time, chopsticks reflect
the communal nature of eating food.

00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:03.309
You'll have these dishes
that you put in the middle,

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:04.601
it's very family style.

00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:06.143
You go in with your chopsticks,

00:03:06.167 --> 00:03:09.268
and you put it on your rice,
and then you eat individually.

00:03:09.292 --> 00:03:11.476
There's actually a famous sort of legend

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.143
where everyone has these
really, really long chopsticks,

00:03:14.167 --> 00:03:16.351
like way too long
for them to feed themselves.

00:03:16.375 --> 00:03:18.559
And so in hell, everyone starves,

00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:21.476
because they can't pick up food
and put it in their mouths.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.768
But in heaven, people
take the same chopsticks

00:03:23.792 --> 00:03:25.268
and then feed each other.
