Amber Galloway-Gallego: OK, hi.

00:00:15.144 --> 00:00:16.931
I'm a sign-language interpreter

00:00:16.955 --> 00:00:19.236
that specializes in music interpreting.

00:00:19.704 --> 00:00:23.893
And you're probably wondering
why Deaf people would attend concerts,

00:00:23.917 --> 00:00:27.647
but actually, music
is so much more than sound

00:00:27.671 --> 00:00:29.977
simply traveling through the ear.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.343
See, Deaf people experience music,
just in a different way.

00:00:34.872 --> 00:00:37.186
For example, my friend Lisa,

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.182
she cuts her hair a certain length,

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:42.959
so she feels the vibrations
of sound in the music.

00:00:44.068 --> 00:00:47.354
And music has psychological effects on us.

00:00:47.722 --> 00:00:54.015
It invokes feelings of nostalgia,
happiness, sadness,

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.312
falling in love.

00:00:55.774 --> 00:00:58.678
It makes you have a feeling
of connectedness,

00:00:58.702 --> 00:01:00.281
and unfortunately,

00:01:00.305 --> 00:01:03.515
Deaf and hard-of-hearing people
are excluded from these events,

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.501
because obtaining a sign-language
interpreter is so difficult

00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:09.524
and so overwhelming

00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:13.190
that they simply don't buy
the tickets or they just give up,

00:01:13.214 --> 00:01:14.820
and this is not OK.

00:01:14.844 --> 00:01:17.460
We have to make everything accessible.

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:22.755
So, myself, I am
a sign-language interpreter,

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:27.567
so what I have to do is I have
to take music and bring it to life.

00:01:28.352 --> 00:01:30.718
In doing that, I become a bridge

00:01:30.742 --> 00:01:33.265
between the hearing world
and the Deaf world,

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.419
making sure that I'm representing music

00:01:36.443 --> 00:01:39.195
and the artistry of what music represents.

00:01:39.678 --> 00:01:41.937
Now, this is a lot of work, OK?

00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:45.129
For a regular set that might be 12 songs,

00:01:45.153 --> 00:01:46.695
myself and a team,

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.443
we have to study over 30 songs
or more for one set

00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:52.884
and hope and pray
we have the right setlist.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.980
But you know what?

00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:56.377
You know what the reward is?

00:01:56.401 --> 00:01:57.925
Looking down in the audience

00:01:57.949 --> 00:02:00.757
and seeing Deaf
and hard-of-hearing members,

00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:03.750
all of those people dancing
and jamming out

00:02:03.774 --> 00:02:08.154
and feeling included
in that music experience.

00:02:09.487 --> 00:02:13.090
For myself, I'm a part of this cultural
and linguistic community,

00:02:14.298 --> 00:02:16.727
and we all communicate in different ways.

00:02:16.751 --> 00:02:18.797
Some of us sign and voice,

00:02:18.821 --> 00:02:20.737
some of us just sign,

00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:23.307
but no one way is superior to the other.

00:02:23.737 --> 00:02:24.888
But you know what?

00:02:24.912 --> 00:02:30.600
Those with hearing loss face
daily battles to communication access,

00:02:30.624 --> 00:02:33.584
and those barriers
are put up daily for them.

00:02:33.997 --> 00:02:35.937
And music shouldn't be one of them.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.027
So along with Madame Gandhi
and myself today,

00:02:39.051 --> 00:02:41.026
let's break down those barriers.

00:02:42.273 --> 00:02:45.007
(Applause and cheers)

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:48.539
(Music: "Top Knot Turn Up")

00:02:48.563 --> 00:02:52.929
(Percussion)

00:02:52.953 --> 00:02:55.700
Madame Gandhi: This is a song
about getting the work done.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.288
Hair up in a bun that's the most fun.

00:02:57.312 --> 00:02:59.270
Hearing myself think when I go for a run

00:02:59.294 --> 00:03:00.901
or maybe I'm practicing the drums

00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:02.486
or maybe I'm writing in the sun,

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.566
the takeaway point
is I'm talking to no one.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.449
Protecting my vibes that are wholesome,

00:03:06.473 --> 00:03:08.383
trying my best to solve actual problems.

00:03:08.407 --> 00:03:10.874
If you want to hang with me

00:03:10.898 --> 00:03:15.358
then you have to roll up
your sleeves and work with me.

00:03:15.382 --> 00:03:17.402
This ain't no time to come flirt with me;

00:03:17.426 --> 00:03:20.006
pipelines and drills
are destroying the earth, you see.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.983
I cannot stand all the constant misogyny.

00:03:22.007 --> 00:03:24.437
Tie my hair back so there
ain't nothing stopping me.

00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:26.650
Top knot turn up. It's a top knot turn up.

00:03:26.674 --> 00:03:28.698
Top knot turn up, turn up, turn up --

00:03:28.722 --> 00:03:30.330
about getting the work done.

00:03:30.354 --> 00:03:32.445
Top knot turn up, turn up, turn up.

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:33.706
It's a top knot turn up.

00:03:34.054 --> 00:03:35.476
Top knot turn up, eh.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.998
(Percussion)

00:03:53.063 --> 00:03:54.688
Tie up and tie up your hair

00:03:54.712 --> 00:03:56.115
and throw back those curls.

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.278
So tie up and tie up and tie up your hair

00:03:58.302 --> 00:04:00.299
and throw back those curls, uh ...

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:01.473
Throw back those curls,

00:04:01.497 --> 00:04:04.362
throw back and throw back
and throw back those curls, uh ...

00:04:04.386 --> 00:04:06.791
(Beatboxing)

00:04:06.815 --> 00:04:10.473
(Percussion and beatboxing)

00:04:21.091 --> 00:04:23.456
I turned off my phone's notifications,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.123
so I have more time.

00:04:25.147 --> 00:04:28.728
No bubbles to trouble
my clear state of mind.

00:04:28.752 --> 00:04:30.877
One thing to know, I'm not here to please.

00:04:30.901 --> 00:04:32.606
Hair tied back, I do it properly.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.232
My time is not your property

00:04:34.256 --> 00:04:35.999
when I'm productive like my ovaries.

00:04:36.023 --> 00:04:40.024
Eh, give a grown girl room to breathe,
basic rights and her liberty.

00:04:40.048 --> 00:04:43.427
Free from insecurity
that the world's projecting onto me.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.770
Please do not trouble me
when I am focused.

00:04:45.794 --> 00:04:47.922
The future is female,
you already know this.

00:04:47.946 --> 00:04:50.090
I'm fighting against
the corruption on SCOTUS,

00:04:50.114 --> 00:04:52.491
upping my top knot
since when I first wrote this.

00:04:52.515 --> 00:04:53.666
Eh ...

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:54.916
It's a top knot turn up.

00:04:55.294 --> 00:04:57.326
Top knot turn up, turn up, turn up --

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.937
about getting the work done.

00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:01.114
Top knot turn up, turn up, turn up.

00:05:01.138 --> 00:05:02.650
It's a top knot turn up.

00:05:02.674 --> 00:05:04.146
Top knot turn up, ay.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.252
(Percussion)

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.387
Tie up and tie up and tie up your hair,

00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:24.813
throw back those curls.

00:05:24.837 --> 00:05:27.103
Tie up and tie up your hair,

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:28.956
throw back those curls, uh ...

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.130
Throw back those curls,

00:05:30.154 --> 00:05:32.657
throw back and throw back
and throw back those curls.

00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:34.863
(Beatboxing)

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:37.922
Amber G.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.433
(Applause and cheers)

00:05:41.457 --> 00:05:42.679
Top knot turn up.

00:05:42.703 --> 00:05:46.802
(Music and applause)

00:05:46.826 --> 00:05:47.992
Madame Gandhi.

00:05:48.016 --> 00:05:49.423
(Music)

00:05:49.447 --> 00:05:51.390
(Applause and cheers)

00:05:51.414 --> 00:05:52.565
(Music ends)

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:59.479
(Applause and cheers)

00:05:59.503 --> 00:06:02.948
Amber, it's such a pleasure
to share this stage with you,

00:06:02.972 --> 00:06:05.194
and to make my music accessible

00:06:05.218 --> 00:06:08.591
to an audience who might be
hard of hearing or Deaf

00:06:08.615 --> 00:06:12.180
and otherwise might not be able
to be included in my music.

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:16.248
And it really wasn't
until this collaboration

00:06:16.272 --> 00:06:19.002
that I had thought of the fact
that though I work so much

00:06:19.026 --> 00:06:20.753
in diversity and inclusion,

00:06:20.777 --> 00:06:23.963
that my music may not be reaching
as many people as it could be.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.394
I grew up in New York City,
playing the drums,

00:06:28.418 --> 00:06:31.450
listening to Nas, Lauryn Hill,
Thievery Corporation,

00:06:31.474 --> 00:06:32.709
TV on the Radio,

00:06:32.733 --> 00:06:33.883
the Spice Girls --

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:36.925
And for me, music was truth.

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:40.635
Music was my perspective
into somebody else's point of view,

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:41.810
into storytelling,

00:06:41.834 --> 00:06:43.927
into understanding how the world works.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.081
And yet at the same time,
I felt like there was such a disconnect

00:06:48.105 --> 00:06:49.677
between the way that I understood

00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:53.386
my own very multidimensional
sense of my gender identity

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.935
and the very two-dimensional way
that women and femmes

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:57.736
were often portrayed in the media.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.910
(Sighs)

00:06:59.727 --> 00:07:01.204
As I moved through my life,

00:07:01.228 --> 00:07:04.685
I went on to study mathematics
and women's studies at Georgetown.

00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:07.672
I was the first-ever data analyst
at Interscope Records.

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:10.781
I toured the world
playing the drums for M.I.A.

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:12.160
And I did my MBA at Harvard,

00:07:12.184 --> 00:07:16.217
all with the intention of being able
to make a difference in the music industry

00:07:16.241 --> 00:07:19.173
and move the needle on gender equality
from the business side.

00:07:21.356 --> 00:07:23.808
But it was only until three years ago,

00:07:23.832 --> 00:07:27.275
when I ran the London Marathon
bleeding freely on my cycle

00:07:27.299 --> 00:07:30.649
to combat the global menstrual stigma
that women face every day

00:07:30.673 --> 00:07:32.381
all around the world,

00:07:32.405 --> 00:07:34.709
that I realized that I have a message,

00:07:34.733 --> 00:07:37.551
and that the most effective way
that I can convey my message

00:07:37.575 --> 00:07:38.725
was through my music.

00:07:39.777 --> 00:07:40.994
And why music?

00:07:41.018 --> 00:07:42.857
Because music caters to the emotions.

00:07:42.881 --> 00:07:44.167
Music is joyful.

00:07:44.191 --> 00:07:47.240
Music pulls you in with the beat
and the rhythm and the melodies.

00:07:47.264 --> 00:07:49.857
The music pulls you in
via the community aspect of it.

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:53.275
And music allows you to access
somebody else's truth.

00:07:54.074 --> 00:07:55.552
In the music I listen to today,

00:07:55.576 --> 00:07:57.958
sometimes I'm like, wow,
I love the rhythm so much,

00:07:57.982 --> 00:07:59.685
but the message is so misogynist,

00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:01.441
it's tough to work out to our run to

00:08:01.465 --> 00:08:03.482
or do whatever it is
that I'm trying to do.

00:08:03.506 --> 00:08:06.412
I oftentimes say, "I'm not here
trying to turn up to the sound

00:08:06.436 --> 00:08:07.587
of my own oppression."

00:08:07.611 --> 00:08:08.966
You feel me?

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.648
(Laughter and cheers)

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:13.263
So I'm here to build
the alternative instead.

00:08:14.311 --> 00:08:17.796
In my work, I talk often about
the notion that the future is female.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.156
That we can actually look
to the femme archetype

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.181
and derive alternative
styles of leadership

00:08:22.205 --> 00:08:24.502
that might encourage,
instead, collaboration,

00:08:24.526 --> 00:08:26.166
emotional intelligence

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.847
and building a world
that is linked and not ranked.

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:33.655
And so for anyone watching or listening
and experiencing this talk today,

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:36.783
I encourage you to consider
the blind spots in your work

00:08:36.807 --> 00:08:39.404
and what partnerships
or collaborations you can do

00:08:39.428 --> 00:08:43.176
to be able to make your work
have even greater of an impact.

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:45.843
This next song is called "Bad Habits,"

00:08:45.867 --> 00:08:48.487
and it's about being
an even better version of yourself.

00:08:49.464 --> 00:08:53.257
(Percussion and beatboxing)

00:09:18.671 --> 00:09:21.084
(Singing) I had run out of time,

00:09:21.108 --> 00:09:23.500
I had done lost my mind,

00:09:23.524 --> 00:09:25.983
I had run out of time,

00:09:26.007 --> 00:09:28.264
I had done lost my mind.

00:09:28.288 --> 00:09:32.367
I didn't know

00:09:32.893 --> 00:09:34.538
why.

00:09:34.562 --> 00:09:37.252
I didn't know.

00:09:37.685 --> 00:09:40.627
I been so pressed that I don't even know

00:09:41.014 --> 00:09:42.522
what's bothering me.

00:09:42.546 --> 00:09:45.869
All my bad habits have go to, got to go

00:09:45.893 --> 00:09:47.910
entirely.

00:09:48.267 --> 00:09:50.474
It's my year to be free

00:09:50.498 --> 00:09:52.727
from what's bothering me.

00:09:53.102 --> 00:09:55.516
It's this society

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.102
that's killing me.

00:09:57.126 --> 00:10:00.616
All my bad habits have got to, go to go.

00:10:01.835 --> 00:10:04.941
All my bad habits have got to, got to go.

00:10:06.665 --> 00:10:09.635
All my bad habits have got to, got to go.

00:10:09.969 --> 00:10:11.119
Yeah.

00:10:11.461 --> 00:10:14.543
All my bad habits have got to, got to go.

00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:16.532
Turn with me.

00:10:16.556 --> 00:10:20.397
(Beatboxing)

00:10:32.292 --> 00:10:33.442
Ready?

00:10:34.651 --> 00:10:35.801
Clap with me.

00:10:37.705 --> 00:10:44.203
(Audience claps)

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:45.377
Now listen.

00:10:45.401 --> 00:10:48.570
(Singing) Fela Kuti in the 1970s

00:10:48.594 --> 00:10:50.048
inspires me.

00:10:50.072 --> 00:10:53.231
All he wanted was his people to be free

00:10:53.255 --> 00:10:55.784
from the colony,

00:10:55.808 --> 00:10:59.650
like Mahatma Gandhi in the 1940s.

00:10:59.674 --> 00:11:03.038
I've been reading about women's history

00:11:03.062 --> 00:11:04.841
in the 1920s,

00:11:04.865 --> 00:11:07.514
thinking about how I could be
so much better.

00:11:09.476 --> 00:11:12.080
Thinking about all the tears I've cried.

00:11:14.359 --> 00:11:17.310
Thinking about how we could
be so much better.

00:11:19.154 --> 00:11:22.280
Thinking about all the tears we've cried.

00:11:22.935 --> 00:11:28.005
(Percussion)

00:11:45.537 --> 00:11:46.687
Yes.

00:11:52.792 --> 00:11:55.435
All my bad habits have got to, got to go.

00:11:57.617 --> 00:12:00.347
All my bad habits have got to, got to go.

00:12:02.463 --> 00:12:05.565
All my bad habits have got to, got to go.

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.256
All my bad habits have got to, got to go.

00:12:12.126 --> 00:12:15.205
All my bad habits have got to, got to go.

00:12:16.904 --> 00:12:20.187
All my bad habits have got to, got to go.

00:12:21.771 --> 00:12:24.731
All my bad habits have got to, got to go.

00:12:26.595 --> 00:12:29.231
All my bad habits have got to, got to go.

00:12:31.457 --> 00:12:32.757
(Music ends)

00:12:33.923 --> 00:12:37.512
(Applause and cheers)

00:12:37.536 --> 00:12:38.687
Thank you.

00:12:38.711 --> 00:12:42.375
