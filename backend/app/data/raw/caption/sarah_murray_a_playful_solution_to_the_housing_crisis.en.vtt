00:00:13.507 --> 00:00:14.920
Hi.

00:00:14.944 --> 00:00:16.158
My name's Sarah,

00:00:17.087 --> 00:00:19.926
and I've been priced out
of the housing market.

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:22.992
In fact,

00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:27.967
I'm one of the majority of my generation

00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:30.079
who can't afford a home.

00:00:31.228 --> 00:00:36.227
And in 2017, home ownership
amongst young Australians

00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:41.176
has fallen to the lowest level
in recorded history.

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:46.141
So, foolishly or otherwise,

00:00:46.165 --> 00:00:48.085
I decided to build my own home.

00:00:49.585 --> 00:00:52.116
But the prognosis
wasn't good there, either.

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:56.203
Architects cater for the one percent,

00:00:56.227 --> 00:00:57.807
builders are scarce,

00:00:57.831 --> 00:01:01.378
so service is inconsistent
and prices are high.

00:01:02.325 --> 00:01:06.053
The single biggest investment in my life,

00:01:06.077 --> 00:01:09.810
and I was amazed
how little self-determination,

00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:11.863
choice

00:01:12.442 --> 00:01:14.886
and, ultimately, control I had.

00:01:16.053 --> 00:01:21.780
What's more, I was doubly surprised
at how vulnerable this made me feel.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.255
Frankly, I felt trapped.

00:01:27.923 --> 00:01:32.158
So, I reflected on this
for quite some time.

00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:34.594
And I realized

00:01:34.618 --> 00:01:40.330
what I wanted was democratized
design and construction.

00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:46.286
And that led to me asking
one very simple question:

00:01:47.452 --> 00:01:49.919
What is building a house?

00:01:51.332 --> 00:01:52.482
What is it?

00:01:52.934 --> 00:01:57.109
Well, it turns out that building a house

00:01:57.133 --> 00:02:02.617
is making a series of decisions,
some with physical consequences,

00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:06.092
within a defined set of parameters.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.728
Now, having worked in software
applications for some time now,

00:02:10.752 --> 00:02:12.759
this all sounded very familiar to me.

00:02:13.696 --> 00:02:17.450
I also couldn't understand
why we build on-site.

00:02:18.442 --> 00:02:23.296
No other major assembly in our lives
is constructed like this.

00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:26.690
Your car doesn't come to you in pieces

00:02:26.714 --> 00:02:29.165
with an extra 10 percent just in case,

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.422
to be assembled at the mercy
of the elements.

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.600
So why should your house?

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.301
So I built a computer game.

00:02:40.532 --> 00:02:43.960
A game that allows you to design your home

00:02:43.984 --> 00:02:45.783
and have it delivered to you.

00:02:45.807 --> 00:02:49.450
A game that puts the home builder

00:02:49.474 --> 00:02:54.621
back at the center of the largest
purchase in their life,

00:02:55.266 --> 00:02:59.646
elevating them from spectator to player.

00:03:00.927 --> 00:03:05.376
A game with full visibility of the costs
and environmental impact

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.668
of each new attribute you add.

00:03:08.466 --> 00:03:13.037
Using modular components,
players select items from their library

00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:15.128
and drag them into their world.

00:03:16.053 --> 00:03:22.222
Each item, be it a wall, a solar battery
or even an armchair,

00:03:22.246 --> 00:03:26.719
contains all of the information
for the system to calculate costs,

00:03:26.743 --> 00:03:28.641
environmental impact

00:03:28.665 --> 00:03:31.578
and even a happiness tally for the player.

00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:37.478
Eighty-three percent of home builders
said that next to cost,

00:03:37.502 --> 00:03:42.091
environmentally friendly features
were the most important things to them.

00:03:42.553 --> 00:03:46.619
So out of the gate, homes
are integrated with solar systems.

00:03:47.276 --> 00:03:49.265
Born green.

00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:54.712
Sustainable housing is often associated
with wealth and affluence,

00:03:54.736 --> 00:03:56.378
but that shouldn't be the case.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.229
In fact, truly sustainable housing
should be available to everyone

00:04:01.253 --> 00:04:03.317
and affordable for all.

00:04:04.563 --> 00:04:11.337
So, I had found a way to get
the control back that I was craving

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:14.163
and give it to others.

00:04:15.173 --> 00:04:16.863
But something was still bugging me,

00:04:16.887 --> 00:04:18.902
something was still
keeping me up at night.

00:04:21.038 --> 00:04:22.905
What about those people

00:04:23.783 --> 00:04:28.591
who have genuinely no control
over where they live?

00:04:29.704 --> 00:04:33.848
Every hour -- in the space
of your intermission --

00:04:33.872 --> 00:04:38.152
4,000 new homes are needed in the world.

00:04:38.506 --> 00:04:40.362
Wrap your head around that number.

00:04:41.585 --> 00:04:48.385
That's an astonishing 35 million homes
globally, every year.

00:04:49.641 --> 00:04:51.387
And in Australia alone,

00:04:51.411 --> 00:04:55.902
we have a shortfall of 250,000 dwellings.

00:04:56.768 --> 00:04:59.934
And in addition to that,

00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:05.799
we have 190,000 families
on the assisted-housing wait list;

00:05:06.481 --> 00:05:09.847
families in need of a home.

00:05:11.615 --> 00:05:14.687
Between now and 2050,

00:05:14.711 --> 00:05:21.600
when the global population
is set to move from today's 7.6 billion

00:05:21.624 --> 00:05:26.710
to tomorrow's 9.8 billion people,

00:05:26.734 --> 00:05:29.996
hundreds of millions of people

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.977
will experience security, health
and safety issues.

00:05:37.127 --> 00:05:41.681
Imagine if you can
not feeling secure in your home --

00:05:42.626 --> 00:05:45.088
not from crime, not from theft,

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:49.117
but from the fact
that the building you're in --

00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:50.347
the building you're in --

00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:52.304
might not be structurally sound

00:05:53.268 --> 00:05:55.871
or built from nontoxic components

00:05:55.895 --> 00:05:58.628
or meet local natural disaster standards.

00:06:00.926 --> 00:06:02.823
It's the 21st century.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.299
And this just isn't good enough.

00:06:09.395 --> 00:06:11.667
What if -- what if --

00:06:13.167 --> 00:06:18.696
we could restore control and dignity
to those individuals

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.075
by giving them a home,
but not just any home:

00:06:23.165 --> 00:06:24.315
their home,

00:06:24.823 --> 00:06:26.623
and a home of their design.

00:06:27.756 --> 00:06:31.855
We're currently adapting our game
so that when a player builds a home,

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:34.852
they're contributing to a home
for someone in need.

00:06:35.791 --> 00:06:38.069
And I know this sounds like a lofty goal,

00:06:38.093 --> 00:06:40.227
and it is ridiculously ambitious,

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:43.617
but today, our current operating model

00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:46.251
operates at a ten-to-one ratio.

00:06:46.691 --> 00:06:49.008
So for every 10 homes we build,

00:06:49.032 --> 00:06:52.264
we can build a home for someone in need.

00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:57.675
(Applause)

00:06:58.022 --> 00:07:01.760
This is made possible because today,

00:07:01.784 --> 00:07:04.564
with design for manufacture and assembly,

00:07:05.538 --> 00:07:10.029
which uses light gauge
steel frame construction,

00:07:10.053 --> 00:07:12.450
shipped and assembled on-site,

00:07:12.474 --> 00:07:15.394
we can decrease construction
costs by 20 percent

00:07:15.418 --> 00:07:18.472
and environmental waste by 15 percent,

00:07:18.496 --> 00:07:20.757
saving time, money

00:07:20.781 --> 00:07:23.988
and keeping tons of waste
out of landfills.

00:07:24.586 --> 00:07:27.967
The power in modular construction

00:07:27.991 --> 00:07:32.825
is that you can build year-round
with confidence in your costs,

00:07:33.902 --> 00:07:35.609
in your quality,

00:07:35.633 --> 00:07:38.236
and in your delivery date,
in your build date.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.779
Now, wouldn't that be crazy?
Wouldn't that be great?

00:07:41.807 --> 00:07:43.077
But --

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:47.434
that doesn't get me to my goal.

00:07:47.458 --> 00:07:51.184
My goal is one-for-one.

00:07:52.863 --> 00:07:55.300
So I've been traveling the world,

00:07:55.324 --> 00:07:58.649
looking at different alternatives
of construction 3-D printing,

00:07:58.673 --> 00:08:02.331
trying to find technology
that will help me deliver on my ambition.

00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:07.259
3-D printing is so exciting
and so promising,

00:08:07.283 --> 00:08:11.577
offering a 40 percent reduction in cost
and near zero waste.

00:08:12.546 --> 00:08:14.252
And this is just to name a few,

00:08:14.276 --> 00:08:17.748
but some of the really exciting
innovations happening all over the world

00:08:17.772 --> 00:08:20.785
are happening in Italy, France,
Dubai and Australia.

00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:25.453
And they use robotic arms
to print everything from solid stone

00:08:25.477 --> 00:08:26.908
to concrete, to wax.

00:08:26.932 --> 00:08:30.849
In Italy, they have developed
a technique using sorel cement.

00:08:31.182 --> 00:08:35.556
Sorel cement was originally
invented in 1867,

00:08:36.085 --> 00:08:42.371
and it's the beautiful chemical marriage
of magnesium oxide and local sand,

00:08:42.395 --> 00:08:46.163
which they can now use
to print solid stone walls.

00:08:46.601 --> 00:08:47.783
And in France,

00:08:47.807 --> 00:08:51.362
they have a regulator-approved
although still experimental process

00:08:51.386 --> 00:08:54.950
where they print two parallel
tracks of foam insulation

00:08:54.974 --> 00:08:58.057
and pour concrete in the middle
to create solid stone.

00:08:59.061 --> 00:09:04.942
And in Dubai, sitting at the foot
of those two glorious Emirates Towers,

00:09:04.966 --> 00:09:07.910
is a vision of the future
in the middle of the desert.

00:09:07.934 --> 00:09:11.513
They've got their experimental
office of the future,

00:09:11.537 --> 00:09:14.918
which is constructed
using 3-D printed concrete

00:09:14.942 --> 00:09:16.292
which was printed in China

00:09:16.316 --> 00:09:18.940
and shipped and assembled
on location in Dubai.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:20.806
And not to be outdone,

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.433
in Australia, we've pioneered
an amazing technology

00:09:24.457 --> 00:09:26.974
that allows you to print wax molds

00:09:26.998 --> 00:09:29.498
and pour concrete over the top of them,

00:09:29.522 --> 00:09:35.188
allowing you to create really intricately
beautiful and cost-effective facades

00:09:35.212 --> 00:09:36.527
that you can see in person

00:09:36.551 --> 00:09:38.966
the next time you travel
the London Underground.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.998
But all of these things are tools --

00:09:42.488 --> 00:09:44.789
hammer of tomorrow, if you like.

00:09:44.813 --> 00:09:47.845
And the one common thread
that connects all these things

00:09:47.869 --> 00:09:50.281
is computer-aided design.

00:09:50.305 --> 00:09:55.078
We will need models
to build using these techniques,

00:09:55.434 --> 00:10:00.011
models like the ones being developed
by players in our game.

00:10:02.545 --> 00:10:06.571
I want to put every person that wants one

00:10:06.595 --> 00:10:08.779
in a home of their own design.

00:10:09.761 --> 00:10:12.070
And there are many
more applications still.

00:10:12.476 --> 00:10:17.213
We could usher in an entirely new
empowered experience

00:10:17.237 --> 00:10:20.380
of special needs
or aged-care accommodation.

00:10:20.737 --> 00:10:23.307
And we could provide rapid,
on-site assistance

00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:25.464
in emergency housing situations.

00:10:26.371 --> 00:10:28.855
In the words of one of my players,

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:31.814
"I want to take matters into my own hands

00:10:31.838 --> 00:10:34.095
and live by example."

00:10:35.371 --> 00:10:36.522
Thank you.

00:10:36.546 --> 00:10:39.559
(Applause)
