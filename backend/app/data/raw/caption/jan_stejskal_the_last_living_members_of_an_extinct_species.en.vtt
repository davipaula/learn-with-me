00:00:06.855 --> 00:00:12.955
In the savannahs of Kenya, two female 
northern white rhinos, Nájin and Fatu,

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:15.565
munch contentedly on the grass.

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:18.040
At the time of this video’s publication,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.390
these are the last two known 
northern white rhinos left on Earth.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.030
Their species is functionally extinct—

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.990
without a male, 
Nájin and Fatu can’t reproduce.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.410
And yet, there’s still hope to revive 
the northern white rhino.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.269
How can that be?

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.700
The story starts about 50 years ago,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.330
when poachers began illegally hunting 
thousands of rhinos

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.340
across Africa for their horns.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.440
This, combined with civil wars 
in their territory,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.640
decimated northern white rhino 
populations.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.427
Concerned conservationists began trying 
to breed them in captivity in the 1970s,

00:00:57.427 --> 00:01:00.707
collecting and storing semen from males.

00:01:00.707 --> 00:01:05.474
Only four rhinos were ultimately born 
through the ambitious breeding program.

00:01:05.474 --> 00:01:09.824
Nájin, and her daughter Fatu 
were the last two.

00:01:09.824 --> 00:01:15.440
In 2014, conservationists discovered 
that neither can have a calf.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.530
Though Nájin gave birth to Fatu, 
she now has weak hindlegs,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.437
which could harm her health 
if she became pregnant again.

00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:27.128
Fatu, meanwhile, 
has a degenerated uterine lining.

00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:34.112
Then, the last northern white rhino male 
of the species, Sudan, died in 2018.

00:01:34.112 --> 00:01:38.062
But there was one glimmer of hope: 
artificial reproduction.

00:01:38.062 --> 00:01:42.539
With no living males and no females 
able to carry a pregnancy,

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.531
this is a complicated and risky process 
to say the least.

00:01:46.531 --> 00:01:51.125
Though scientists had stored semen, 
they would have to collect the eggs—

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:56.759
a complex procedure that requires a female
to be sedated for up to two hours.

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.419
Then, they’d create a viable embryo 
in the lab—

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:05.150
something that had never been done before,
and no one knew how to do.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.980
Even that was just the beginning—

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.341
a surrogate mother 
of another rhino species

00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:13.272
would have to carry the embryo to term.

00:02:13.272 --> 00:02:17.422
Females of a closely related species, 
the southern white rhino,

00:02:17.422 --> 00:02:21.092
became both the key to developing 
a rhino embryo in a lab

00:02:21.092 --> 00:02:25.062
and the leading candidates 
for surrogate mothers.

00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:29.552
Northern and southern white rhinos 
diverged about a million of years ago

00:02:29.552 --> 00:02:33.542
into separate— though still 
closely-related— species.

00:02:33.542 --> 00:02:38.038
They inhabit different regions, and have 
slightly different physical traits.

00:02:38.038 --> 00:02:42.108
In a fortunate coincidence, 
several female southern white rhinos

00:02:42.108 --> 00:02:45.042
needed treatment 
for their own reproductive problems,

00:02:45.042 --> 00:02:49.412
and researchers could collect eggs 
as part of that treatment.

00:02:49.412 --> 00:02:53.427
In Dvůr Králové Zoo in October 2015,

00:02:53.427 --> 00:02:59.111
experts of IZW Berlin began collecting 
eggs from southern white rhinos

00:02:59.111 --> 00:03:04.895
and sending them to Avantea, an animal 
reproduction laboratory in Italy.

00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:11.921
There, scientists developed and perfected 
a technique to create a viable embryo.

00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:13.651
Once they mastered the technique,

00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:19.709
researchers extracted Nájin and Fatu’s 
eggs on August 22, 2019

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.769
and flew them to Italy.

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.187
Three days later, they fertilized 
the eggs with sperm

00:03:25.187 --> 00:03:27.737
from a northern white rhino male.

00:03:27.737 --> 00:03:32.029
After another week, two of the eggs 
made it to the stage of development

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:36.111
when the embryo can be frozen 
and preserved for future.

00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:41.049
Another collection in December 2019 
produced one more embryo.

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:47.919
As of early 2020, the plan is to collect 
Nájin and Fatu’s eggs three times a year

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.809
if they’re healthy enough.

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:51.999
In the meantime, 
researchers are looking for

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:55.179
promising southern white rhino 
surrogate mothers—

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:58.979
ideally who’ve carried a pregnancy 
to term before.

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:02.289
The surrogacy plan 
is somewhat of a leap of faith—

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:05.209
southern and northern white rhinos 
have interbred

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.149
both during the last glacial period 
and more recently in 1977,

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:13.859
so researchers are optimistic 
a southern white rhino

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.109
would be able to carry 
a northern white rhino to term.

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.909
Also, the two species’ pregnancies 
are the same length.

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:24.879
Still, transferring an embryo 
to a rhino is tricky

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.179
because of the shape of the cervix.

00:04:27.179 --> 00:04:29.809
The ultimate goal, 
which will take decades,

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:34.249
is to establish a breeding population 
of northern white rhinos

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:36.577
in their original range.

00:04:36.577 --> 00:04:39.769
Studies suggest that we have samples 
from enough individuals

00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:45.420
to recreate a population with the genetic 
diversity the species had a century ago.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.890
Though the specifics 
of this effort are unique,

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.146
as more species face critical endangerment
or functional extinction,

00:04:52.146 --> 00:04:55.529
it’s also an arena for big questions:

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:59.846
do we have a responsibility to try 
to bring species back from the brink,

00:04:59.846 --> 00:05:03.928
especially when human actions 
brought them there in the first place?

00:05:03.928 --> 00:05:06.724
Are there limits to the effort 
we should expend

00:05:06.724 --> 00:05:10.196
on saving animals threatened 
with extinction?
