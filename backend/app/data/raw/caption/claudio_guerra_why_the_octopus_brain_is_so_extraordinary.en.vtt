00:00:07.058 --> 00:00:11.074
What could octopuses possibly
have in common with us?

00:00:11.074 --> 00:00:17.014
After all, they don't have lungs, spines,
or even a plural noun we can all agree on.

00:00:17.014 --> 00:00:20.162
But what they do have is the ability
to solve puzzles,

00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:21.998
learn through observation,

00:00:21.998 --> 00:00:23.634
and even use tools,

00:00:23.634 --> 00:00:26.112
just like some other animals we know.

00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:29.131
And what makes octopus intelligence
so amazing

00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:31.509
is that it comes 
from a biological structure

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.430
completely different from ours.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.074
The 200 or so species of octopuses

00:00:37.074 --> 00:00:40.731
are mollusks 
belonging to the order cephalopoda,

00:00:40.731 --> 00:00:42.722
Greek for head-feet.

00:00:42.722 --> 00:00:45.707
Those heads contain impressively
large brains,

00:00:45.707 --> 00:00:50.458
with a brain to body ratio similar
to that of other intelligent animals,

00:00:50.458 --> 00:00:55.850
and a complex nervous system with
about as many neurons as that of a dog.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.136
But instead of being 
centralized in the brain,

00:00:58.136 --> 00:01:04.171
these 500 million neurons are spread out
in a network of interconnected ganglia

00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:07.580
organized into three basic structures.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.888
The central brain only contains
about 10% of the neurons,

00:01:11.888 --> 00:01:16.670
while the two huge optic lobes
contain about 30%.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.398
The other 60% are in the tentacles,

00:01:19.398 --> 00:01:24.366
which for humans would be like
our arms having minds of their own.

00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.999
This is where things 
get even more interesting.

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:30.869
Vertebrates like us have a rigid skeleton
to support our bodies,

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.841
with joints that allow us to move.

00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:35.413
But not all types of movement are allowed.

00:01:35.413 --> 00:01:37.245
You can't bend your knee backwards,

00:01:37.245 --> 00:01:40.136
or bend your forearm in the middle,
for example.

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:43.665
Cephalopods, on the other hand,
have no bones at all,

00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:48.339
allowing them to bend their limbs
at any point and in any direction.

00:01:48.339 --> 00:01:49.638
So shaping their tentacles

00:01:49.638 --> 00:01:53.785
into any one of the virtually 
limitless number of possible arrangements

00:01:53.785 --> 00:01:56.739
is unlike anything we are used to.

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:00.694
Consider a simple task,
like grabbing and eating an apple.

00:02:00.694 --> 00:02:04.348
The human brain contains a neurological
map of our body.

00:02:04.348 --> 00:02:05.473
When you see the apple,

00:02:05.473 --> 00:02:09.226
your brain's motor center activates
the appropriate muscles,

00:02:09.226 --> 00:02:11.310
allowing you to reach out with your arm,

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.852
grab it with your hand,

00:02:12.852 --> 00:02:14.265
bend your elbow joint,

00:02:14.265 --> 00:02:15.870
and bring it to your mouth.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.666
For an octopus, 
the process is quite different.

00:02:18.666 --> 00:02:20.465
Rather than a body map,

00:02:20.465 --> 00:02:23.898
the cephalopod brain 
has a behavior library.

00:02:23.898 --> 00:02:26.013
So when an octopus sees food,

00:02:26.013 --> 00:02:28.905
its brain doesn't activate 
a specific body part,

00:02:28.905 --> 00:02:32.473
but rather a behavioral response to grab.

00:02:32.473 --> 00:02:34.556
As the signal travels through the network,

00:02:34.556 --> 00:02:36.990
the arm neurons pick up the message

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.724
and jump into action 
to command the movement.

00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:41.877
As soon as the arm touches the food,

00:02:41.877 --> 00:02:46.535
a muscle activation wave travels
all the way through the arm to its base,

00:02:46.535 --> 00:02:50.709
while the arm sends back another wave
from the base to the tip.

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.400
The signals meet halfway
between the food and the base of the arm,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.343
letting it know to bend at that spot.

00:02:57.343 --> 00:03:01.591
What all this means is that each
of an octopus's eight arms

00:03:01.591 --> 00:03:04.092
can essentially think for itself.

00:03:04.092 --> 00:03:06.825
This gives it amazing flexibility 
and creativity

00:03:06.825 --> 00:03:09.644
when facing a new situation or problem,

00:03:09.644 --> 00:03:11.702
whether its opening 
a bottle to reach food,

00:03:11.702 --> 00:03:13.436
escaping through a maze,

00:03:13.436 --> 00:03:15.359
moving around in a new environment,

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.601
changing the texture and the color
of its skin to blend into the scenery,

00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:23.648
or even mimicking other creatures
to scare away enemies.

00:03:23.648 --> 00:03:26.477
Cephalopods may have evolved 
complex brains

00:03:26.477 --> 00:03:29.170
long before our vertebrate relatives.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.959
And octopus intelligence isn't just useful
for octopuses.

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.774
Their radically different nervous system
and autonomously thinking appendages

00:03:37.774 --> 00:03:39.572
have inspired new research

00:03:39.572 --> 00:03:43.944
in developing flexible robots
made of soft materials.

00:03:43.944 --> 00:03:48.882
And studying how intelligence can arise
along such a divergent evolutionary path

00:03:48.882 --> 00:03:54.056
can help us understand more about
intelligence and consciousness in general.

00:03:54.056 --> 00:03:57.483
Who knows what other forms 
of intelligent life are possible,

00:03:57.483 --> 00:04:00.791
or how they process the world around them.
