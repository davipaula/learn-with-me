00:00:12.877 --> 00:00:17.503
My research lab sits about a mile
from where several bombs exploded

00:00:17.527 --> 00:00:19.904
during the Boston Marathon in 2013.

00:00:21.036 --> 00:00:24.973
The surviving bomber,
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev of Chechnya,

00:00:24.997 --> 00:00:27.789
was tried, convicted
and sentenced to death.

00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:31.077
Now, when a jury has to make the decision

00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:34.776
between life in prison
and the death penalty,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.435
they base their decision largely
on whether or not the defendant

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:42.000
feels remorseful for his actions.

00:00:42.024 --> 00:00:44.749
Tsarnaev spoke words of apology,

00:00:44.773 --> 00:00:46.977
but when jurors looked at his face,

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:50.001
all they saw was a stone-faced stare.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.601
Now, Tsarnaev is guilty,
there's no doubt about that.

00:00:55.982 --> 00:00:59.400
He murdered and maimed innocent people,

00:00:59.424 --> 00:01:01.393
and I'm not here to debate that.

00:01:01.417 --> 00:01:04.317
My heart goes out
to all the people who suffered.

00:01:04.668 --> 00:01:07.374
But as a scientist, I have to tell you

00:01:07.398 --> 00:01:11.740
that jurors do not
and cannot detect remorse

00:01:11.764 --> 00:01:15.327
or any other emotion in anybody ever.

00:01:16.572 --> 00:01:19.620
Neither can I, and neither can you,

00:01:19.644 --> 00:01:22.707
and that's because emotions
are not what we think they are.

00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:26.135
They are not universally
expressed and recognized.

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:30.128
They are not hardwired brain reactions

00:01:30.152 --> 00:01:31.469
that are uncontrollable.

00:01:32.997 --> 00:01:35.267
We have misunderstood
the nature of emotion

00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:37.781
for a very long time,

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:42.663
and understanding what emotions really are
has important consequences for all of us.

00:01:43.687 --> 00:01:47.611
I have studied emotions as a scientist
for the past 25 years,

00:01:47.635 --> 00:01:53.185
and in my lab, we have probed human faces
by measuring electrical signals

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:57.015
that cause your facial muscles to contract
to make facial expressions.

00:01:57.742 --> 00:02:01.857
We have scrutinized
the human body in emotion.

00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:05.476
We have analyzed
hundreds of physiology studies

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.143
involving thousands of test subjects.

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:09.874
We've scanned hundreds of brains,

00:02:09.898 --> 00:02:13.008
and examined every
brain imaging study on emotion

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:15.357
that has been published
in the past 20 years.

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:21.087
And the results of all of this research
are overwhelmingly consistent.

00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:27.669
It may feel to you
like your emotions are hardwired

00:02:27.693 --> 00:02:30.843
and they just trigger and happen to you,

00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:32.169
but they don't.

00:02:32.984 --> 00:02:38.159
You might believe that your brain
is prewired with emotion circuits,

00:02:38.183 --> 00:02:41.492
that you're born with emotion
circuits, but you're not.

00:02:41.516 --> 00:02:45.517
In fact, none of us in this room
have emotion circuits in our brain.

00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:49.866
In fact, no brain on this planet
contains emotion circuits.

00:02:51.432 --> 00:02:53.400
So what are emotions, really?

00:02:55.185 --> 00:02:58.351
Well, strap on your seat belt,
because ...

00:02:59.815 --> 00:03:01.933
emotions are guesses.

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:08.275
They are guesses that your brain
constructs in the moment

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.394
where billions of brain cells
are working together,

00:03:12.418 --> 00:03:15.495
and you have more control
over those guesses

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.495
than you might imagine that you do.

00:03:19.352 --> 00:03:22.978
Now, if that sounds preposterous to you,
or, you know, kind of crazy,

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:27.510
I'm right there with you, because frankly,
if I hadn't seen the evidence for myself,

00:03:27.534 --> 00:03:29.590
decades of evidence for myself,

00:03:29.614 --> 00:03:32.240
I am fairly sure
that I wouldn't believe it either.

00:03:32.675 --> 00:03:38.222
But the bottom line is that emotions
are not built into your brain at birth.

00:03:39.655 --> 00:03:41.298
They are just built.

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:45.734
To see what I mean, have a look at this.

00:03:46.648 --> 00:03:51.331
Right now, your brain
is working like crazy.

00:03:51.355 --> 00:03:55.442
Your neurons are firing like mad
trying to make meaning out of this

00:03:55.466 --> 00:03:58.602
so that you see something
other than black and white blobs.

00:03:58.626 --> 00:04:03.109
Your brain is sifting
through a lifetime of experience,

00:04:03.133 --> 00:04:05.968
making thousands of guesses
at the same time,

00:04:05.992 --> 00:04:07.977
weighing the probabilities,

00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:09.897
trying to answer the question,

00:04:09.921 --> 00:04:11.993
"What is this most like?"

00:04:12.017 --> 00:04:13.246
not "What is it?"

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.646
but "What is this most like
in my past experience?"

00:04:16.951 --> 00:04:19.866
And this is all happening
in the blink of an eye.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.430
Now if your brain is still struggling
to find a good match

00:04:24.454 --> 00:04:26.988
and you still see black and white blobs,

00:04:27.012 --> 00:04:31.221
then you are in a state
called "experiential blindness,"

00:04:31.245 --> 00:04:35.132
and I am going to cure you
of your blindness.

00:04:35.156 --> 00:04:37.695
This is my favorite part.
Are you ready to be cured?

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:39.514
(Cheers)

00:04:39.538 --> 00:04:41.274
All right. Here we go.

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:46.222
(Gasps)

00:04:48.648 --> 00:04:49.941
All right.

00:04:49.965 --> 00:04:54.200
So now many of you see a snake,

00:04:54.224 --> 00:04:55.733
and why is that?

00:04:55.757 --> 00:05:00.399
Because as your brain is sifting
through your past experience,

00:05:00.423 --> 00:05:01.852
there's new knowledge there,

00:05:01.876 --> 00:05:04.026
the knowledge that came
from the photograph.

00:05:04.491 --> 00:05:06.725
And what's really cool is that

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:09.511
that knowledge which you just
acquired moments ago

00:05:09.535 --> 00:05:14.177
is changing how you experience
these blobs right now.

00:05:15.134 --> 00:05:18.358
So your brain is constructing
the image of a snake

00:05:18.382 --> 00:05:20.509
where there is no snake,

00:05:20.533 --> 00:05:23.096
and this kind of a hallucination

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.572
is what neuroscientists like me
call "predictions."

00:05:26.995 --> 00:05:30.781
Predictions are basically
the way your brain works.

00:05:30.805 --> 00:05:33.321
It's business as usual for your brain.

00:05:33.345 --> 00:05:36.592
Predictions are the basis
of every experience that you have.

00:05:36.616 --> 00:05:39.339
They are the basis
of every action that you take.

00:05:39.363 --> 00:05:44.506
In fact, predictions are what allow you
to understand the words that I'm speaking

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.180
as they come out of my --

00:05:47.024 --> 00:05:49.620
Audience: Mouth.
Lisa Feldman Barrett: Mouth. Exactly.

00:05:49.644 --> 00:05:53.039
Predictions are primal.

00:05:53.063 --> 00:05:56.476
They help us to make sense
of the world in a quick and efficient way.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.079
So your brain does not react to the world.

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:04.716
Using past experience,

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.902
your brain predicts and constructs

00:06:07.926 --> 00:06:09.827
your experience of the world.

00:06:12.057 --> 00:06:17.869
The way that we see emotions in others
are deeply rooted in predictions.

00:06:17.893 --> 00:06:20.892
So to us, it feels like
we just look at someone's face,

00:06:20.916 --> 00:06:24.701
and we just read the emotion
that's there in their facial expressions

00:06:24.725 --> 00:06:26.950
the way that we would read
words on a page.

00:06:26.974 --> 00:06:31.204
But actually, under the hood,
your brain is predicting.

00:06:31.228 --> 00:06:35.138
It's using past experience
based on similar situations

00:06:35.162 --> 00:06:36.852
to try to make meaning.

00:06:36.876 --> 00:06:39.377
This time, you're not
making meaning of blobs,

00:06:39.401 --> 00:06:42.130
you're making meaning of facial movements

00:06:42.154 --> 00:06:45.407
like the curl of a lip
or the raise of an eyebrow.

00:06:46.194 --> 00:06:47.900
And that stone-faced stare?

00:06:48.341 --> 00:06:53.340
That might be someone
who is a remorseless killer,

00:06:53.364 --> 00:06:55.276
but a stone-faced stare might also mean

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.589
that someone is stoically
accepting defeat,

00:06:58.613 --> 00:07:02.404
which is in fact what Chechen culture
prescribes for someone

00:07:02.428 --> 00:07:04.705
in Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's situation.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.241
So the lesson here

00:07:08.265 --> 00:07:12.695
is that emotions that you seem
to detect in other people

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:17.442
actually come in part
from what's inside your own head.

00:07:17.466 --> 00:07:20.038
And this is true in the courtroom,

00:07:20.062 --> 00:07:23.021
but it's also true in the classroom,

00:07:23.045 --> 00:07:25.088
in the bedroom,

00:07:25.112 --> 00:07:27.100
and in the boardroom.

00:07:28.366 --> 00:07:30.224
And so here's my concern:

00:07:30.248 --> 00:07:33.167
tech companies
which shall remain nameless ...

00:07:34.047 --> 00:07:35.197
well, maybe not.

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:36.673
You know, Google, Facebook --

00:07:36.697 --> 00:07:40.109
(Laughter)

00:07:40.133 --> 00:07:45.816
are spending millions of research dollars
to build emotion-detection systems,

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.870
and they are fundamentally
asking the wrong question,

00:07:48.894 --> 00:07:53.838
because they're trying to detect
emotions in the face and the body,

00:07:53.862 --> 00:07:56.676
but emotions aren't in your face and body.

00:07:57.137 --> 00:08:01.367
Physical movements
have no intrinsic emotional meaning.

00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:05.696
We have to make them meaningful.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.305
A human or something else
has to connect them to the context,

00:08:09.329 --> 00:08:11.115
and that makes them meaningful.

00:08:11.139 --> 00:08:16.925
That's how we know
that a smile might mean sadness

00:08:16.949 --> 00:08:19.981
and a cry might mean happiness,

00:08:20.005 --> 00:08:23.567
and a stoic, still face might mean

00:08:23.591 --> 00:08:27.122
that you are angrily plotting
the demise of your enemy.

00:08:29.873 --> 00:08:33.270
Now, if I haven't already
gone out on a limb,

00:08:33.294 --> 00:08:36.682
I'll just edge out on that limb
a little further and tell you

00:08:36.706 --> 00:08:40.142
that the way that you experience
your own emotion

00:08:40.166 --> 00:08:43.047
is exactly the same process.

00:08:43.071 --> 00:08:47.762
Your brain is basically
making predictions, guesses,

00:08:47.786 --> 00:08:50.072
that it's constructing in the moment

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:54.305
with billions of neurons working together.

00:08:55.106 --> 00:08:59.393
Now your brain does come
prewired to make some feelings,

00:08:59.417 --> 00:09:04.219
simple feelings that come
from the physiology of your body.

00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:05.927
So when you're born,

00:09:05.951 --> 00:09:10.345
you can make feelings
like calmness and agitation,

00:09:10.369 --> 00:09:12.773
excitement, comfort, discomfort.

00:09:13.266 --> 00:09:16.289
But these simple feelings
are not emotions.

00:09:16.313 --> 00:09:20.146
They're actually with you
every waking moment of your life.

00:09:20.694 --> 00:09:25.275
They are simple summaries
of what's going on inside your body,

00:09:25.299 --> 00:09:26.757
kind of like a barometer.

00:09:27.908 --> 00:09:29.980
But they have very little detail,

00:09:30.004 --> 00:09:32.907
and you need that detail
to know what to do next.

00:09:32.931 --> 00:09:34.713
What do you about these feelings?

00:09:35.061 --> 00:09:37.315
And so how does your brain
give you that detail?

00:09:37.339 --> 00:09:39.093
Well, that's what predictions are.

00:09:39.117 --> 00:09:42.546
Predictions link
the sensations in your body

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:44.380
that give you these simple feelings

00:09:44.404 --> 00:09:46.459
with what's going on
around you in the world

00:09:46.483 --> 00:09:47.832
so that you know what to do.

00:09:47.856 --> 00:09:49.333
And sometimes,

00:09:49.357 --> 00:09:54.395
those constructions are emotions.

00:09:54.419 --> 00:09:59.174
So for example, if you were
to walk into a bakery,

00:09:59.198 --> 00:10:03.007
your brain might predict
that you will encounter

00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:07.110
the delicious aroma of freshly baked
chocolate chip cookies.

00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:09.266
I know my brain would predict

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.897
the delicious aroma of freshly baked
chocolate cookies.

00:10:11.921 --> 00:10:14.912
And our brains might cause
our stomachs to churn a little bit,

00:10:14.936 --> 00:10:17.897
to prepare for eating those cookies.

00:10:17.921 --> 00:10:19.652
And if we are correct,

00:10:19.676 --> 00:10:22.699
if in fact some cookies
have just come out of the oven,

00:10:22.723 --> 00:10:25.665
then our brains will
have constructed hunger,

00:10:25.689 --> 00:10:29.617
and we are prepared
to munch down those cookies

00:10:29.641 --> 00:10:32.015
and digest them in a very efficient way,

00:10:32.039 --> 00:10:33.864
meaning that we can eat a lot of them,

00:10:33.888 --> 00:10:35.633
which would be a really good thing.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.684
You guys are not laughing enough.
I'm totally serious.

00:10:38.708 --> 00:10:42.525
(Laughter)

00:10:42.549 --> 00:10:43.699
But here's the thing.

00:10:43.723 --> 00:10:46.127
That churning stomach,

00:10:46.151 --> 00:10:48.301
if it occurs in a different situation,

00:10:48.325 --> 00:10:50.325
it can have a completely
different meaning.

00:10:50.349 --> 00:10:53.904
So if your brain were to predict
a churning stomach

00:10:53.928 --> 00:10:58.927
in, say, a hospital room
while you're waiting for test results,

00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:01.650
then your brain will be constructing dread

00:11:01.674 --> 00:11:04.173
or worry or anxiety,

00:11:04.197 --> 00:11:07.895
and it might cause you to, maybe,

00:11:07.919 --> 00:11:10.410
wring your hands

00:11:10.434 --> 00:11:12.996
or take a deep breath or even cry.

00:11:13.808 --> 00:11:18.481
Right? Same physical sensation,
same churning stomach,

00:11:18.505 --> 00:11:19.990
different experience.

00:11:20.678 --> 00:11:22.377
And so the lesson here

00:11:22.401 --> 00:11:26.536
is that emotions which seem
to happen to you

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.036
are actually made by you.

00:11:32.115 --> 00:11:37.139
You are not at the mercy
of mythical emotion circuits

00:11:37.163 --> 00:11:40.603
which are buried deep inside
some ancient part of your brain.

00:11:42.006 --> 00:11:45.688
You have more control over your emotions

00:11:45.712 --> 00:11:47.267
than you think you do.

00:11:47.291 --> 00:11:49.570
I don't mean that you can
just snap your fingers

00:11:49.594 --> 00:11:53.778
and change how you feel the way
that you would change your clothes,

00:11:53.802 --> 00:11:56.309
but your brain is wired

00:11:56.333 --> 00:12:02.365
so that if you change the ingredients
that your brain uses to make emotion,

00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:05.555
then you can transform
your emotional life.

00:12:06.274 --> 00:12:09.106
So if you change those ingredients today,

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:14.018
you're basically teaching your brain
how to predict differently tomorrow,

00:12:14.042 --> 00:12:19.113
and this is what I call
being the architect of your experience.

00:12:20.605 --> 00:12:21.858
So here's an example.

00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:27.181
All of us have had a nervous feeling
before a test, right?

00:12:27.974 --> 00:12:32.443
But some people experience
crippling anxiety before a test.

00:12:32.467 --> 00:12:33.775
They have test anxiety.

00:12:35.406 --> 00:12:40.096
Based on past experiences of taking tests,

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.445
their brains predict
a hammering heartbeat,

00:12:43.469 --> 00:12:44.888
sweaty hands,

00:12:44.912 --> 00:12:50.412
so much so that they are unable
to actually take the test.

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:51.698
They don't perform well,

00:12:51.722 --> 00:12:56.119
and sometimes they not only fail courses
but they actually might fail college.

00:12:57.131 --> 00:12:58.282
But here's the thing:

00:12:59.036 --> 00:13:02.848
a hammering heartbeat
is not necessarily anxiety.

00:13:02.872 --> 00:13:08.007
It could be that your body
is preparing to do battle

00:13:08.031 --> 00:13:09.515
and ace that test ...

00:13:10.449 --> 00:13:12.624
or, you know, give a talk

00:13:12.648 --> 00:13:16.244
in front of hundreds of people
on a stage where you're being filmed.

00:13:16.268 --> 00:13:17.863
(Laughter)

00:13:17.887 --> 00:13:19.133
I'm serious.

00:13:19.158 --> 00:13:20.896
(Laughter)

00:13:21.529 --> 00:13:25.990
And research shows
that when students learn

00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:28.745
to make this kind
of energized determination

00:13:28.769 --> 00:13:30.210
instead of anxiety,

00:13:30.234 --> 00:13:32.330
they perform better on tests.

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:38.039
And that determination seeds their brain
to predict differently in the future

00:13:38.063 --> 00:13:41.094
so that they can get their butterflies
flying in formation.

00:13:41.507 --> 00:13:43.659
And if they do that often enough,

00:13:43.683 --> 00:13:46.231
they not only can pass a test

00:13:46.255 --> 00:13:49.279
but it will be easier for them
to pass their courses,

00:13:49.303 --> 00:13:52.264
and they might even finish college,

00:13:52.288 --> 00:13:56.556
which has a huge impact
on their future earning potential.

00:13:57.458 --> 00:14:00.688
So I call this emotional
intelligence in action.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:05.514
Now you can cultivate
this emotional intelligence yourself

00:14:05.538 --> 00:14:07.804
and use it in your everyday life.

00:14:07.828 --> 00:14:09.713
So just, you know,

00:14:09.737 --> 00:14:11.317
imagine waking up in the morning.

00:14:11.341 --> 00:14:13.776
I'm sure you've had
this experience. I know I have.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.435
You wake up and as you're emerging
into consciousness,

00:14:16.459 --> 00:14:19.650
you feel this horrible dread,

00:14:19.674 --> 00:14:21.675
you know, this real wretchedness,

00:14:21.699 --> 00:14:24.381
and immediately, your mind starts to race.

00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:27.485
You start to think about
all the crap that you have to do at work

00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:29.217
and you have that mountain of email

00:14:29.241 --> 00:14:32.136
which you will never
dig yourself out of ever,

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.986
the phone calls you have to return,

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.882
and that important meeting across town,

00:14:35.906 --> 00:14:37.945
and you're going to have to fight traffic,

00:14:37.969 --> 00:14:39.690
you'll be late picking your kids up,

00:14:39.714 --> 00:14:42.538
your dog is sick, and what
are you going to make for dinner?

00:14:42.562 --> 00:14:43.745
Oh my God.

00:14:43.769 --> 00:14:45.275
What is wrong with your life?

00:14:45.299 --> 00:14:46.885
What is wrong with my life?

00:14:46.909 --> 00:14:52.379
(Laughter)

00:14:52.403 --> 00:14:54.926
That mind racing is prediction.

00:14:55.510 --> 00:15:00.232
Your brain is searching
to find an explanation

00:15:00.256 --> 00:15:05.876
for those sensations in your body
that you experience as wretchedness,

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.828
just like you did with the blobby image.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:16.465
So your brain is trying to explain
what caused those sensations

00:15:16.489 --> 00:15:18.489
so that you know what to do about them.

00:15:19.242 --> 00:15:20.854
But those sensations

00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:23.926
might not be an indication
that anything is wrong with your life.

00:15:24.296 --> 00:15:27.108
They might have a purely physical cause.

00:15:27.132 --> 00:15:28.347
Maybe you're tired.

00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:29.801
Maybe you didn't sleep enough.

00:15:29.825 --> 00:15:31.175
Maybe you're hungry.

00:15:31.199 --> 00:15:32.775
Maybe you're dehydrated.

00:15:33.691 --> 00:15:39.290
The next time that you feel
intense distress,

00:15:39.314 --> 00:15:41.025
ask yourself:

00:15:41.049 --> 00:15:44.739
Could this have a purely physical cause?

00:15:45.208 --> 00:15:48.816
Is it possible that you can transform

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.816
emotional suffering
into just mere physical discomfort?

00:15:54.182 --> 00:15:56.626
Now I am not suggesting to you

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:59.571
that you can just perform
a couple of Jedi mind tricks

00:15:59.595 --> 00:16:02.587
and talk yourself out of being depressed

00:16:02.611 --> 00:16:07.126
or anxious or any kind
of serious condition.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.785
But I am telling you

00:16:08.809 --> 00:16:12.682
that you have more control
over your emotions than you might imagine,

00:16:12.706 --> 00:16:14.602
and that you have the capacity

00:16:14.626 --> 00:16:17.707
to turn down the dial
on emotional suffering

00:16:17.731 --> 00:16:19.865
and its consequences for your life

00:16:19.889 --> 00:16:22.741
by learning how to construct
your experiences differently.

00:16:24.112 --> 00:16:25.866
And all of us can do this

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.781
and with a little practice,
we can get really good at it,

00:16:28.805 --> 00:16:30.050
like driving.

00:16:30.074 --> 00:16:31.834
At first, it takes a lot of effort,

00:16:31.858 --> 00:16:34.112
but eventually it becomes
pretty automatic.

00:16:35.302 --> 00:16:36.610
Now I don't know about you,

00:16:36.634 --> 00:16:41.954
but I find this to be
a really empowering and inspiring message,

00:16:41.978 --> 00:16:44.613
and the fact that it's backed up
by decades of research

00:16:44.637 --> 00:16:47.546
makes me also happy as a scientist.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:50.713
But I have to also warn you
that it does come with some fine print,

00:16:50.737 --> 00:16:55.403
because more control
also means more responsibility.

00:16:57.225 --> 00:17:01.474
If you are not at the mercy
of mythical emotion circuits

00:17:01.498 --> 00:17:03.795
which are buried deep
inside your brain somewhere

00:17:03.819 --> 00:17:05.932
and which trigger automatically,

00:17:05.956 --> 00:17:08.613
then who's responsible,

00:17:08.637 --> 00:17:10.755
who is responsible when you behave badly?

00:17:12.422 --> 00:17:13.572
You are.

00:17:14.028 --> 00:17:17.050
Not because you're culpable
for your emotions,

00:17:17.074 --> 00:17:22.062
but because the actions
and the experiences that you make today

00:17:22.086 --> 00:17:24.911
become your brain's
predictions for tomorrow.

00:17:25.775 --> 00:17:28.641
Sometimes we are responsible for something

00:17:28.665 --> 00:17:31.302
not because we're to blame

00:17:31.326 --> 00:17:34.397
but because we're the only ones
who can change it.

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.175
Now responsibility is a big word.

00:17:38.199 --> 00:17:39.921
It's so big, in fact,

00:17:39.945 --> 00:17:45.484
that sometimes people feel the need
to resist the scientific evidence

00:17:45.508 --> 00:17:49.008
that emotions are built and not built in.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:55.132
The idea that we are responsible
for our own emotions

00:17:55.156 --> 00:17:57.899
seems very hard to swallow.

00:17:59.027 --> 00:18:02.829
But what I'm suggesting to you
is you don't have to choke on that idea.

00:18:02.853 --> 00:18:04.233
You just take a deep breath,

00:18:04.257 --> 00:18:07.195
maybe get yourself
a glass of water if you need to,

00:18:07.219 --> 00:18:08.375
and embrace it.

00:18:08.399 --> 00:18:10.050
Embrace that responsibility,

00:18:10.074 --> 00:18:14.502
because it is the path
to a healthier body,

00:18:14.526 --> 00:18:18.443
a more just and informed legal system,

00:18:18.467 --> 00:18:21.308
and a more flexible
and potent emotional life.

00:18:21.935 --> 00:18:23.086
Thank you.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:27.571
(Applause)
