00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.923
If you can't imagine
life without chocolate,

00:00:10.923 --> 00:00:15.942
you're lucky you weren't born before
the 16th century.

00:00:15.942 --> 00:00:19.450
Until then, chocolate only existed
in Mesoamerica

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.305
in a form quite different 
from what we know.

00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:24.685
As far back as 1900 BCE,

00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:27.805
the people of that region had learned
to prepare the beans

00:00:27.805 --> 00:00:30.716
of the native cacao tree.

00:00:30.716 --> 00:00:33.216
The earliest records tell us the beans
were ground

00:00:33.216 --> 00:00:36.465
and mixed with cornmeal
and chili peppers

00:00:36.465 --> 00:00:37.956
to create a drink -

00:00:37.956 --> 00:00:40.096
not a relaxing cup of hot cocoa,

00:00:40.096 --> 00:00:44.736
but a bitter, invigorating concoction
frothing with foam.

00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:47.976
And if you thought we make
a big deal about chocolate today,

00:00:47.976 --> 00:00:51.166
the Mesoamericans had us beat.

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.596
They believed that cacao
was a heavenly food

00:00:53.596 --> 00:00:57.016
gifted to humans
by a feathered serpent god,

00:00:57.016 --> 00:00:59.539
known to the Maya as Kukulkan

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.836
and to the Aztecs as Quetzalcoatl.

00:01:02.836 --> 00:01:05.287
Aztecs used cacao beans as currency

00:01:05.287 --> 00:01:07.826
and drank chocolate at royal feasts,

00:01:07.826 --> 00:01:10.736
gave it to soldiers as a reward
for success in battle,

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:13.417
and used it in rituals.

00:01:13.417 --> 00:01:18.137
The first transatlantic
chocolate encounter occurred in 1519

00:01:18.137 --> 00:01:21.727
when Hernán Cortés visited
the court of Moctezuma

00:01:21.727 --> 00:01:23.486
at Tenochtitlan.

00:01:23.486 --> 00:01:25.587
As recorded by Cortés's lieutenant,

00:01:25.587 --> 00:01:31.287
the king had 50 jugs of the drink
brought out and poured into golden cups.

00:01:31.287 --> 00:01:34.707
When the colonists returned with shipments
of the strange new bean,

00:01:34.707 --> 00:01:37.727
missionaries' salacious accounts
of native customs

00:01:37.727 --> 00:01:42.068
gave it a reputation as an aphrodisiac.

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:45.778
At first, its bitter taste made it
suitable as a medicine for ailments,

00:01:45.778 --> 00:01:47.978
like upset stomachs,

00:01:47.978 --> 00:01:50.777
but sweetening it with honey,
sugar, or vanilla

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:55.458
quickly made chocolate a popular delicacy
in the Spanish court.

00:01:55.458 --> 00:02:01.568
And soon, no aristocratic home was
complete without dedicated chocolate ware.

00:02:01.568 --> 00:02:05.378
The fashionable drink was difficult
and time consuming to produce

00:02:05.378 --> 00:02:06.859
on a large scale.

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:10.369
That involved using plantations
and imported slave labor

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.509
in the Caribbean and 
on islands off the coast of Africa.

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.179
The world of chocolate would change
forever in 1828

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:24.029
with the introduction of the cocoa press
by Coenraad van Houten of Amsterdam.

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:28.531
Van Houten's invention could separate
the cocoa's natural fat, or cocoa butter.

00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:32.516
This left a powder that could be mixed
into a drinkable solution

00:02:32.516 --> 00:02:34.989
or recombined with the cocoa butter

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.209
to create the solid chocolate
we know today.

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.202
Not long after, a Swiss chocolatier
named Daniel Peter

00:02:42.202 --> 00:02:44.701
added powdered milk to the mix,

00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:47.790
thus inventing milk chocolate.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.389
By the 20th century, chocolate
was no longer an elite luxury

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.851
but had become a treat for the public.

00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:58.114
Meeting the massive demand required
more cultivation of cocoa,

00:02:58.114 --> 00:03:00.815
which can only grow near the equator.

00:03:00.815 --> 00:03:03.731
Now, instead of African slaves 
being shipped

00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:06.021
to South American cocoa plantations,

00:03:06.021 --> 00:03:09.151
cocoa production itself would shift
to West Africa

00:03:09.151 --> 00:03:14.701
with Cote d'Ivoire providing two-fifths
of the world's cocoa as of 2015.

00:03:14.701 --> 00:03:16.744
Yet along with the growth
of the industry,

00:03:16.744 --> 00:03:19.977
there have been horrific abuses
of human rights.

00:03:19.977 --> 00:03:22.230
Many of the plantations throughout
West Africa,

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.260
which supply Western companies,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.731
use slave and child labor,

00:03:26.731 --> 00:03:31.942
with an estimation of more than
2 million children affected.

00:03:31.942 --> 00:03:33.951
This is a complex problem
that persists

00:03:33.951 --> 00:03:38.981
despite efforts from major chocolate
companies to partner with African nations

00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:42.901
to reduce child 
and indentured labor practices.

00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:47.792
Today, chocolate has established itself
in the rituals of our modern culture.

00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:51.442
Due to its colonial association with
native cultures,

00:03:51.442 --> 00:03:53.892
combined with the power of advertising,

00:03:53.892 --> 00:03:57.113
chocolate retains an aura
of something sensual,

00:03:57.113 --> 00:03:58.212
decadent,

00:03:58.212 --> 00:03:59.663
and forbidden.

00:03:59.663 --> 00:04:03.471
Yet knowing more about its fascinating
and often cruel history,

00:04:03.471 --> 00:04:05.562
as well as its production today,

00:04:05.562 --> 00:04:08.642
tells us where 
these associations originate

00:04:08.642 --> 00:04:11.052
and what they hide.

00:04:11.052 --> 00:04:13.912
So as you unwrap 
your next bar of chocolate,

00:04:13.912 --> 00:04:19.911
take a moment to consider that
not everything about chocolate is sweet.
