00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.802
What do these animals have in common?

00:00:09.802 --> 00:00:11.942
More than you might think.

00:00:11.942 --> 00:00:15.872
Along with over 5,000 other species,
they're mammals,

00:00:15.872 --> 00:00:18.853
or members of class mammalia.

00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:21.903
All mammals are vertebrates,
meaning they have backbones.

00:00:21.903 --> 00:00:24.411
But mammals are distinguished 
from other vertebrates

00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:27.283
by a number of shared features.

00:00:27.283 --> 00:00:28.953
That includes warm blood,

00:00:28.953 --> 00:00:31.173
body hair or fur,

00:00:31.173 --> 00:00:33.593
the ability to breathe using lungs,

00:00:33.593 --> 00:00:36.524
and nourishing their young with milk.

00:00:36.524 --> 00:00:38.264
But despite these similarities,

00:00:38.264 --> 00:00:41.552
these creatures also have 
many biological differences,

00:00:41.552 --> 00:00:44.823
and one of the most remarkable
is how they give birth.

00:00:44.823 --> 00:00:48.844
Let's start with the most familiar,
placental mammals.

00:00:48.844 --> 00:00:50.143
This group includes humans,

00:00:50.143 --> 00:00:50.864
cats,

00:00:50.864 --> 00:00:51.584
dogs,

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:52.392
giraffes,

00:00:52.392 --> 00:00:56.354
and even the blue whale,
the biggest animal on Earth.

00:00:56.354 --> 00:00:59.433
Its placenta, a solid disk
of blood-rich tissue,

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:03.984
attaches to the wall of the uterus
to support the developing embryo.

00:01:03.984 --> 00:01:07.384
The placenta is what keeps
the calf alive during pregnancy.

00:01:07.384 --> 00:01:09.814
Directly connected to 
the mother's blood supply,

00:01:09.814 --> 00:01:13.336
it funnels nutrients and oxygen 
straight into the calf's body

00:01:13.336 --> 00:01:15.194
via the umbilical cord,

00:01:15.194 --> 00:01:18.484
and also exports its waste.

00:01:18.484 --> 00:01:22.945
Placental mammals can spend far
longer inside the womb than other mammals.

00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:28.416
Baby blue whales, for instance, spend
almost a full year inside their mother.

00:01:28.416 --> 00:01:31.675
The placenta keeps the calf alive
right up until its birth,

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:33.316
when the umbilical cord breaks

00:01:33.316 --> 00:01:35.305
and the newborn's own respiratory,

00:01:35.305 --> 00:01:36.606
circulatory,

00:01:36.606 --> 00:01:40.296
and waste disposal systems take over.

00:01:40.296 --> 00:01:45.199
Measuring about 23 feet,
a newborn calf is already able to swim.

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:46.867
It will spend the next six months

00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:53.477
drinking 225 liters of 
its mothers thick, fatty milk per day.

00:01:53.477 --> 00:01:57.097
Meanwhile, in Australia,
you can find a second type of mammal -

00:01:57.097 --> 00:01:59.789
marsupials.

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:02.968
Marsupial babies are so tiny and delicate
when they're born

00:02:02.968 --> 00:02:07.543
that they must continue developing
in the mother's pouch.

00:02:07.543 --> 00:02:11.368
Take the quoll, one of the world's
smallest marsupials,

00:02:11.368 --> 00:02:14.468
which weighs only 18 milligrams at birth,

00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:18.207
the equivalent of about 30 sugar grains.

00:02:18.207 --> 00:02:20.249
The kangaroo, another marsupial,

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:24.497
gives birth to a single 
jelly bean-sized baby at a time.

00:02:24.497 --> 00:02:27.969
The baby crawls down the middle
of the mother's three vaginas,

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:29.979
then must climb up to the pouch,

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:33.799
where she spends 
the next 6-11 months suckling.

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.509
Even after the baby kangaroo leaves
this warm haven,

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:38.898
she'll return to suckle milk.

00:02:38.898 --> 00:02:43.380
Sometimes, she's just one of three babies
her mother is caring for.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.949
A female kangaroo can often simultaneously
support one inside her uterus

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:50.360
and another in her pouch.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.209
In unfavorable conditions,

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.699
female kangaroos can pause
their pregnancies.

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:59.390
When that happens, she's able
to produce two different kinds of milk,

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.652
one for her newborn,

00:03:00.652 --> 00:03:03.691
and one for her older joey.

00:03:03.691 --> 00:03:06.840
The word mammalia means of the breast,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.211
which is a bit of a misnomer

00:03:08.211 --> 00:03:11.611
because while kangaroos do produce
milk from nipples in their pouches,

00:03:11.611 --> 00:03:14.351
they don't actually have breasts.

00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:21.391
Nor do monotremes, the third and arguably
strangest example of mammalian birth.

00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:24.301
There were once hundreds 
of monotreme species,

00:03:24.301 --> 00:03:26.892
but there are only five left:

00:03:26.892 --> 00:03:31.571
four species of echidnas
and the duck-billed platypus.

00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:34.412
The name monotreme means one hole

00:03:34.412 --> 00:03:37.182
referring to the single orifice they use
for reproduction,

00:03:37.182 --> 00:03:38.242
excretion,

00:03:38.242 --> 00:03:40.152
and egg-laying.

00:03:40.152 --> 00:03:40.952
Like birds,

00:03:40.952 --> 00:03:41.812
reptiles,

00:03:41.812 --> 00:03:42.663
fish,

00:03:42.663 --> 00:03:43.613
dinosaurs,

00:03:43.613 --> 00:03:44.613
and others,

00:03:44.613 --> 00:03:49.053
these species lay eggs instead
of giving birth to live young.

00:03:49.053 --> 00:03:51.492
Their eggs are soft-shelled,

00:03:51.492 --> 00:03:56.005
and when their babies hatch, they suckle
milk from pores on their mother's body

00:03:56.005 --> 00:03:59.694
until they're large enough 
to feed themselves.

00:03:59.694 --> 00:04:03.994
Despite laying eggs and other adaptations
that we associate more with non-mammals,

00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:06.507
like the duck-bill platypus's webbed feet,

00:04:06.507 --> 00:04:07.364
bill,

00:04:07.364 --> 00:04:10.174
and the venomous spur 
males have on their feet,

00:04:10.174 --> 00:04:13.103
they are, in fact, mammals.

00:04:13.103 --> 00:04:16.794
That's because they share the defining
characteristics of mammalia

00:04:16.794 --> 00:04:20.504
and are evolutionarily linked
to the rest of the class.

00:04:20.504 --> 00:04:21.575
Whether placental,

00:04:21.575 --> 00:04:22.544
marsupial,

00:04:22.544 --> 00:04:23.695
or monotreme,

00:04:23.695 --> 00:04:27.380
each of these creatures and its unique
birthing methods, however bizarre,

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.007
have succeeded for many millennia
in bringing new life and diversity

00:04:32.007 --> 00:04:34.032
into the mammal kingdom.
