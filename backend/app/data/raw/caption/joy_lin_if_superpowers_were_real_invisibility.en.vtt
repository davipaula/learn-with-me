00:00:14.517 --> 00:00:17.089
Wouldn't it be great if we could be

00:00:17.113 --> 00:00:18.270
invisible?

00:00:18.294 --> 00:00:19.049
Ha, right?

00:00:19.073 --> 00:00:21.550
I mean, we could spy on people
without being noticed

00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:22.885
and do whatever we want

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:25.505
without being held responsible.

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.195
Now, magicians have figured out

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:29.868
how to utilize full-sized
mirrors to bend light

00:00:29.892 --> 00:00:34.534
in order to create disappearing illusions.

00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:36.914
Scientists have created metamaterials

00:00:36.938 --> 00:00:37.957
to guide rays of light

00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:40.752
around tiny, two-dimensional objects.

00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:43.005
Cameras can also film what is behind you

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.757
and project the image

00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:47.208
so you appear invisible from the front.

00:00:47.232 --> 00:00:49.385
However, none of these options

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:51.578
can make an object as large as a person

00:00:51.602 --> 00:00:54.421
appear invisible
for all angles and distances

00:00:54.445 --> 00:00:55.641
while its moving.

00:00:55.665 --> 00:00:57.768
But if you are truly invisible,

00:00:57.792 --> 00:00:59.691
as in from within,

00:00:59.715 --> 00:01:00.813
here are a few problems

00:01:00.837 --> 00:01:03.662
you may not have thought about before.

00:01:03.686 --> 00:01:06.111
To move around undetected by other people,

00:01:06.135 --> 00:01:09.034
you would have to be totally naked.

00:01:09.058 --> 00:01:11.695
Even if it's freezing outside!

00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:14.459
You can't carry anything,

00:01:14.483 --> 00:01:16.336
including your wallet and keys,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.369
otherwise people would just see

00:01:18.393 --> 00:01:20.155
your wallet and keys floating around.

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:22.751
Drivers and people on the street
can't see you either,

00:01:22.775 --> 00:01:27.101
therefore they can and will run
into you at some point.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.649
Oh, and you better not wear any perfume

00:01:30.673 --> 00:01:32.845
or make any noise breathing,

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.131
otherwise they'll know you're there.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.130
And, just because you start off invisible,

00:01:40.154 --> 00:01:42.025
doesn't mean you'll stay that way.

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.804
What if someone accidentally spills

00:01:43.828 --> 00:01:45.720
scolding hot coffee on you?

00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:48.876
And what if it rains?

00:01:50.745 --> 00:01:54.127
But if you think only liquid
can make you visible,

00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:55.336
you're wrong.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.142
Dust consists of dead
skin cells from humans,

00:01:58.166 --> 00:01:58.904
soil particles,

00:01:58.928 --> 00:02:01.168
and fibers from clothes made from cotton

00:02:01.192 --> 00:02:02.747
and other materials.

00:02:02.771 --> 00:02:05.968
Dust sticks to the moisture
on our skin when we sweat

00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:08.846
and the tiny hairs
on our skin when we are dry.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.138
So, even if you are invisible,

00:02:11.162 --> 00:02:13.601
dust would still land
on every part of you.

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:15.561
We usually don't notice
the dust on our skin

00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:17.587
because we can't see a thin layer of dust

00:02:17.611 --> 00:02:18.936
on top of our skin color.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.273
But, if you're invisible,

00:02:20.297 --> 00:02:22.937
people would see
a human-shaped blob of dust

00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:26.275
walking around with extremely dirty soles.

00:02:27.073 --> 00:02:28.223
Gross!

00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:29.409
What do you think the world looks like

00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:30.253
if you are invisible?

00:02:30.277 --> 00:02:33.059
Well, the answer is nothing.

00:02:33.083 --> 00:02:34.798
The reason you can't see in the dark

00:02:34.822 --> 00:02:36.689
is because there is no light.

00:02:36.713 --> 00:02:37.866
To see an apple,

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:38.900
light has to hit the apple

00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:40.443
and return it to your eyes.

00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:41.931
Then, the retinas in your eyes

00:02:41.955 --> 00:02:43.908
catch the light reflection for your brain

00:02:43.932 --> 00:02:46.489
to interpret into the image of an apple.

00:02:46.513 --> 00:02:47.680
If you're invisible,

00:02:47.704 --> 00:02:49.780
then, by definition, light would travel

00:02:49.804 --> 00:02:51.872
through you or around you

00:02:51.896 --> 00:02:54.470
instead of bouncing off you
for people to see.

00:02:54.494 --> 00:02:56.464
But that means that retinas in your eyes

00:02:56.488 --> 00:02:58.296
are not catching the light, either.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.892
Therefore, your brain has nothing

00:02:59.916 --> 00:03:01.467
to interpret into an image.

00:03:01.491 --> 00:03:03.133
Can you see your reflection

00:03:03.157 --> 00:03:04.824
without a mirror to stop the light?

00:03:04.848 --> 00:03:05.671
No.

00:03:05.695 --> 00:03:07.929
So, when you can't be seen by others,

00:03:07.953 --> 00:03:10.682
you also cannot see.

00:03:10.706 --> 00:03:12.014
Ouch!

00:03:12.038 --> 00:03:13.515
Now, have you given any thought

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:16.187
as of whether the invisibility
is permanent?

00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:18.522
If it is, how can you
receive medical treatment

00:03:18.546 --> 00:03:20.380
from a doctor if you're injured?

00:03:20.404 --> 00:03:21.485
The doctor wouldn't know

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:23.436
where to apply ointments or bandages

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.923
because they cannot access your injury.

00:03:27.947 --> 00:03:29.492
For that matter, you can't see it either.

00:03:29.516 --> 00:03:32.324
I mean, what if you have
an illness or an infection?

00:03:32.348 --> 00:03:33.825
How can the doctor diagnose you

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.711
without being able to see
the color change or inflammation?

00:03:36.735 --> 00:03:39.877
And what if everyone
is permanently invisible?

00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:42.140
Well, think about how boring
the world would be

00:03:42.164 --> 00:03:43.926
without seeing people on the streets,

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.301
on TV,

00:03:44.325 --> 00:03:47.080
or at home on your computer

00:03:47.104 --> 00:03:48.859
like right now.

00:03:48.883 --> 00:03:51.290
It's lonely being invisible.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.277
Now, which superpower physics lesson

00:03:57.301 --> 00:03:59.715
will you explore next?

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.807
Shifting body size and content,

00:04:03.831 --> 00:04:05.201
super speed,

00:04:05.225 --> 00:04:06.629
flight,

00:04:06.653 --> 00:04:09.499
super strength,

00:04:09.523 --> 00:04:12.250
immortality,

00:04:12.274 --> 00:04:14.135
and

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:16.743
invisibility.
