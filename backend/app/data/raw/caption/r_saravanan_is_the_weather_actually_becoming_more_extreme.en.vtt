00:00:06.446 --> 00:00:09.026
From 2016 to 2019,

00:00:09.026 --> 00:00:13.321
meteorologists saw record-breaking
heat waves around the globe,

00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:16.821
rampant wildfires 
in California and Australia,

00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:21.801
and the longest run 
of category 5 tropical cyclones on record.

00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:26.611
The number of extreme weather events
has been increasing for the last 40 years,

00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:30.521
and current predictions suggest 
that trend will continue.

00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:34.021
But are these natural disasters 
simply bad weather?

00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:37.451
Or are they due to our changing climate?

00:00:37.451 --> 00:00:38.751
To answer this question

00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:42.511
we need to understand the differences
between weather and climate—

00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:48.022
what they are, how we predict them,
and what those predictions can tell us.

00:00:48.022 --> 00:00:52.078
Meteorologists define weather 
as the conditions of the atmosphere

00:00:52.078 --> 00:00:54.908
at a particular time and place.

00:00:54.908 --> 00:00:58.318
Currently, researchers can predict 
a region’s weather for the next week

00:00:58.318 --> 00:01:01.088
with roughly 80% accuracy.

00:01:01.088 --> 00:01:05.485
Climate describes a region’s 
average atmospheric conditions

00:01:05.485 --> 00:01:08.685
over periods of a month or more.

00:01:08.685 --> 00:01:13.110
Climate predictions can forecast 
average temperatures for decades to come,

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.719
but they can’t tell us what specific
weather events to expect.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:21.775
These two types of predictions 
give us such different information

00:01:21.775 --> 00:01:24.875
because they’re based on different data.

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:26.275
To forecast weather,

00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:30.415
meteorologists need to measure 
the atmosphere’s initial conditions.

00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:35.380
These are the current levels 
of precipitation, air pressure, humidity,

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.282
wind speed and wind direction 
that determine a region’s weather.

00:01:40.282 --> 00:01:45.063
Twice every day, meteorologists 
from over 800 stations around the globe

00:01:45.063 --> 00:01:47.983
release balloons into the atmosphere.

00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:51.923
These balloons carry instruments 
called radiosondes,

00:01:51.923 --> 00:01:53.444
which measure initial conditions

00:01:53.444 --> 00:01:57.284
and transmit their findings 
to international weather centers.

00:01:57.284 --> 00:02:01.014
Meteorologists then run the data 
through predictive physics models

00:02:01.014 --> 00:02:03.954
that generate the final weather forecast.

00:02:03.954 --> 00:02:07.394
Unfortunately, there’s something stopping
this global web of data

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:09.804
from producing a perfect prediction:

00:02:09.804 --> 00:02:13.494
weather is a fundamentally 
chaotic system.

00:02:13.494 --> 00:02:17.807
This means it’s incredibly sensitive 
and impossible to perfectly forecast

00:02:17.807 --> 00:02:21.807
without absolute knowledge 
of all the system’s elements.

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:23.907
In a period of just ten days,

00:02:23.907 --> 00:02:30.015
even incredibly small disturbances can
massively impact atmospheric conditions—

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:35.278
making it impossible to reliably 
predict weather beyond two weeks.

00:02:35.278 --> 00:02:39.278
Climate prediction, on the other hand,
is far less turbulent.

00:02:39.278 --> 00:02:42.498
This is partly because a region’s climate 
is, by definition,

00:02:42.498 --> 00:02:45.398
the average of all its weather data.

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:48.378
But also because climate forecasts ignore

00:02:48.378 --> 00:02:50.868
what’s currently happening 
in the atmosphere,

00:02:50.868 --> 00:02:54.128
and focus on the range 
of what could happen.

00:02:54.128 --> 00:02:57.748
These parameters are known 
as boundary conditions,

00:02:57.748 --> 00:03:03.064
and as their name suggests, they act
as constraints on climate and weather.

00:03:03.064 --> 00:03:07.186
One example of a boundary condition
is solar radiation.

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:12.450
By analyzing the precise distance 
and angle between a location and the sun,

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.160
we can determine the amount of heat
that area will receive.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.380
And since we know how the sun 
behaves throughout the year,

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.820
we can accurately predict 
its effects on temperature.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.250
Averaged across years of data,

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.742
this reveals periodic patterns,
including seasons.

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:34.693
Most boundary conditions have well-defined
values that change slowly, if at all.

00:03:34.693 --> 00:03:39.401
This allows researchers to reliably 
predict climate years into the future.

00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:41.741
But here’s where it gets tricky.

00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:44.421
Even the slightest change 
in these boundary conditions

00:03:44.421 --> 00:03:48.656
represents a much larger shift 
for the chaotic weather system.

00:03:48.656 --> 00:03:53.436
For example, Earth’s surface temperature
has warmed by almost 1 degree Celsius

00:03:53.436 --> 00:03:56.256
over the last 150 years.

00:03:56.256 --> 00:03:58.666
This might seem like a minor shift,

00:03:58.666 --> 00:04:02.226
but this 1-degree change 
has added the energy equivalent

00:04:02.226 --> 00:04:06.904
of roughly one million 
nuclear warheads into the atmosphere.

00:04:06.904 --> 00:04:11.545
This massive surge of energy 
has already led to a dramatic increase

00:04:11.545 --> 00:04:15.722
in the number of heatwaves, 
droughts, and storm surges.

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:21.651
So, is the increase in extreme weather
due to random chance, or changing climate?

00:04:21.651 --> 00:04:23.001
The answer is that—

00:04:23.001 --> 00:04:26.441
while weather will always 
be a chaotic system—

00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:31.782
shifts in our climate do increase 
the likelihood of extreme weather events.

00:04:31.782 --> 00:04:36.820
Scientists are in near universal agreement
that our climate is changing

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.490
and that human activity 
is accelerating those changes.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.890
But fortunately,

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.253
we can identify what human behaviors
are impacting the climate most

00:04:46.253 --> 00:04:49.513
by tracking which boundary conditions 
are shifting.

00:04:49.513 --> 00:04:53.840
So even though next month’s weather 
might always be a mystery,

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.120
we can work together to protect
the climate for centuries to come.
