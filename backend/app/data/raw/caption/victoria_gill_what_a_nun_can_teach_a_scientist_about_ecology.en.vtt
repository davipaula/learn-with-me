00:00:13.697 --> 00:00:18.335
OK, I would like to introduce all of you
beautiful, curious-minded people

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.330
to my favorite animal in the world.

00:00:20.784 --> 00:00:23.902
This is the Peter Pan
of the amphibian world.

00:00:23.926 --> 00:00:25.608
It's an axolotl.

00:00:25.632 --> 00:00:27.106
It's a type of salamander,

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.951
but it never fully grows up
and climbs out of the water

00:00:29.975 --> 00:00:31.766
like other salamanders do.

00:00:32.178 --> 00:00:35.436
And this little guy has
X-Man-style powers, right?

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.261
So if it loses any limb,

00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:39.520
it can just completely regenerate.

00:00:39.544 --> 00:00:40.695
It's amazing.

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.835
And, I mean, look at it --
it's got a face with a permanent smile.

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:44.865
(Laughter)

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:46.353
It's framed by feathery gills.

00:00:46.377 --> 00:00:48.421
It's just ... how could you not love that?

00:00:48.445 --> 00:00:52.357
This particular type of axolotl,
a very close relative,

00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:53.986
is known as an achoque.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.491
It is equally as cute,

00:00:55.515 --> 00:01:00.219
and it lives in just one place
in a lake in the north of Mexico.

00:01:00.243 --> 00:01:01.984
It's called Lake Pátzcuaro,

00:01:02.008 --> 00:01:03.649
and as you can see,

00:01:03.673 --> 00:01:06.198
it is stunningly beautiful.

00:01:06.222 --> 00:01:09.404
But unfortunately, it's been so overfished
and so badly polluted

00:01:09.428 --> 00:01:11.996
that the achoque is dying out altogether.

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:16.454
And this is something that's a scenario
that's playing out all over the world.

00:01:16.478 --> 00:01:19.263
We're living through an extinction crisis,

00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:22.899
and species are particularly vulnerable
when they're evolutionarily tailored

00:01:22.923 --> 00:01:25.807
to just one little niche
or maybe one lake.

00:01:26.438 --> 00:01:27.598
But this is TED, right?

00:01:27.622 --> 00:01:30.431
So this is where I give you
the big idea, the big solution.

00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:34.604
So how do you save one special
weird species from going extinct?

00:01:34.628 --> 00:01:36.894
Well, the answer, at least my answer,

00:01:36.918 --> 00:01:38.971
isn't a grand technological intervention.

00:01:38.995 --> 00:01:40.370
It's actually really simple.

00:01:40.394 --> 00:01:43.781
It's that you find people
who know all about this animal

00:01:43.805 --> 00:01:46.484
and you ask them and you listen to them

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:51.060
and you work with them,
if they're up for that.

00:01:51.492 --> 00:01:54.234
So I want to tell you about
how I've seen that in science,

00:01:54.258 --> 00:01:55.917
and in conservation in particular,

00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:58.777
if scientists don't team up
with local people

00:01:58.801 --> 00:02:01.102
who have really valuable knowledge

00:02:01.126 --> 00:02:04.945
but a practical wisdom that's not going
to be published in any academic journal,

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:06.623
they can really miss the point.

00:02:07.084 --> 00:02:11.160
Scientists and science as an enterprise
can fall at the first hurdle

00:02:11.184 --> 00:02:15.395
if it rushes in knowing
that it's the experts that know best.

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.252
But when scientists shake off
those academic constraints

00:02:18.276 --> 00:02:21.144
and really look to people
who have a totally different

00:02:21.168 --> 00:02:24.153
but really important perspective
on what they're trying to do,

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:25.905
it can genuinely save the world,

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:28.967
one wonderfully weird amphibian at a time.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.846
So, in the case of the achoque,

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.905
these are the people
you need on your team.

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:34.945
(Laughter)

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.762
These are the Sisters
of the Immaculate Health.

00:02:37.786 --> 00:02:41.578
They are nuns who have a convent
in Pátzcuaro, they live in Pátzcuaro,

00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:44.367
and they have a shared history
with the achoque.

00:02:44.391 --> 00:02:46.493
And it is so mind-bogglingly wonderful

00:02:46.517 --> 00:02:50.075
that it drew me all the way there
to make an audio documentary about them,

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.330
and I even have the unflattering selfie

00:02:52.354 --> 00:02:53.946
to prove it.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.892
There is a room at the center
of their convent, though,

00:02:56.916 --> 00:02:58.069
that looks like this.

00:02:58.093 --> 00:02:59.255
It's very strange.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.843
It's lined with all these tanks
full of fresh water

00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:04.170
and hundreds of achoques.

00:03:04.194 --> 00:03:07.993
And that's because this creature,
because of its regenerative abilities,

00:03:08.017 --> 00:03:11.692
it's believed has healing powers
if you consume it.

00:03:11.716 --> 00:03:17.108
So the sisters actually make and sell
a medicine using achoques.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.975
I bought a bottle of it.

00:03:21.681 --> 00:03:23.312
So this is it.

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:25.697
It tastes a bit like honey,

00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:27.544
but the sisters reckon it is good

00:03:27.568 --> 00:03:30.617
for all kinds of particularly
respiratory ailments.

00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:34.584
So I just want you to have a listen,
if you will, to a clip of Sister Ofelia.

00:03:34.608 --> 00:03:36.600
(Audio) Sister Ofelia: (speaks in Spanish)

00:03:36.624 --> 00:03:40.122
(Audio) (Interpreter voice-over)
Our convent was founded by Dominican nuns

00:03:40.146 --> 00:03:42.921
here in Pátzcuaro in 1747.

00:03:43.957 --> 00:03:45.160
Sometime after that,

00:03:45.184 --> 00:03:48.367
our sisters started to make
the achoque syrup.

00:03:48.391 --> 00:03:50.964
We didn't discover
the properties of the achoque.

00:03:50.988 --> 00:03:56.224
That was the original people
from around here, since ancient times.

00:03:56.248 --> 00:03:58.973
But we then started to make
the syrup, too.

00:03:58.997 --> 00:04:00.180
The locals knew that,

00:04:00.204 --> 00:04:02.810
and they came to offer us the animals.

00:04:02.834 --> 00:04:04.243
(Audio) Victoria Gill: I see.

00:04:04.267 --> 00:04:07.169
So the achoques are
part of making that syrup.

00:04:07.193 --> 00:04:09.932
What does the syrup treat,
and what is it for?

00:04:09.956 --> 00:04:13.046
(Audio) SO: (speaks in Spanish)

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.025
(Audio) (Interpreter voice-over)
It's good for coughs, asthma,

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.888
bronchitis, the lungs and back pain.

00:04:18.912 --> 00:04:21.100
(Audio) VG: And so you've
harnessed that power

00:04:21.124 --> 00:04:22.890
in a syrup, in a medicine.

00:04:22.914 --> 00:04:24.893
Can you tell me how it's made?

00:04:26.371 --> 00:04:30.584
You're shaking your head
and smiling. (Laughter)

00:04:30.608 --> 00:04:33.878
VG: Yeah, they're not up for sharing
the centuries-old secret recipe.

00:04:33.902 --> 00:04:34.949
(Laughter)

00:04:34.973 --> 00:04:39.514
But the decline in the achoque

00:04:39.538 --> 00:04:43.378
actually nearly put a halt
to that medicine production altogether,

00:04:43.402 --> 00:04:45.693
which is why the sisters started this.

00:04:45.717 --> 00:04:48.004
It's the world's first achoque farm.

00:04:48.028 --> 00:04:50.791
All they wanted was a healthy,
sustainable population

00:04:50.815 --> 00:04:53.170
so that they could continue
to make that medicine,

00:04:53.194 --> 00:04:55.186
but what they created at the same time

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.468
was a captive breeding program
for a critically endangered species.

00:04:59.492 --> 00:05:00.928
And fast forward a few years,

00:05:00.952 --> 00:05:03.446
and these scientists
that you can see in this picture

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.653
from Chester Zoo
all the way over the in UK,

00:05:05.677 --> 00:05:06.971
not far from where I live,

00:05:06.995 --> 00:05:10.126
and from Michoacana University
in Morelia in Mexico

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.345
have persuaded the sisters --
it took years of careful diplomacy --

00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:15.784
to join them in a research partnership.

00:05:15.808 --> 00:05:17.786
So the nuns show the biologists

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.448
how you rear perfectly healthy,
very robust Pátzcuaro achoques,

00:05:22.472 --> 00:05:24.784
and the scientists have put
some of their funding

00:05:24.808 --> 00:05:26.220
into tanks, filters and pumps

00:05:26.244 --> 00:05:29.806
in this strange, incongruous
but amazing room.

00:05:30.355 --> 00:05:34.317
This is the kind of partnership
that can save a species.

00:05:34.341 --> 00:05:36.926
But I don't think I see
enough of this sort of thing,

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.254
and I have been ludicrously
lucky in my job.

00:05:39.278 --> 00:05:43.429
I've traveled to loads of places
and just basically followed around

00:05:43.453 --> 00:05:47.445
brilliant people who are trying
to use science to answer big questions

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:49.214
and solve problems.

00:05:49.238 --> 00:05:52.105
I've hung out with scientists
who have solved the mystery

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:54.816
of the origin of the menopause
by tracking killer whales

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.598
off the north Pacific coast.

00:05:56.622 --> 00:05:58.305
And I've followed around scientists

00:05:58.329 --> 00:06:01.169
who've planted cameras
in Antarctic penguin colonies,

00:06:01.193 --> 00:06:04.354
because they were looking to capture
the impacts of climate change

00:06:04.378 --> 00:06:05.901
as it happens.

00:06:05.925 --> 00:06:09.149
But it's this team
that really stuck with me,

00:06:09.173 --> 00:06:10.760
that really showed me the impact

00:06:10.784 --> 00:06:14.839
that these delicate but really
important relationships can have.

00:06:15.966 --> 00:06:18.417
And I think the reason
that it stuck with me as well

00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:19.974
is because it's not common.

00:06:19.998 --> 00:06:22.387
And one of the reasons it's not common

00:06:22.411 --> 00:06:25.579
is because our traditional approach

00:06:25.603 --> 00:06:28.242
of the hierarchical system
of academic achievement

00:06:28.266 --> 00:06:31.778
doesn't exactly encourage
the type of humility

00:06:31.802 --> 00:06:34.668
where scientists will look
to nonscientists

00:06:34.692 --> 00:06:36.763
and really ask for their input.

00:06:37.292 --> 00:06:39.785
In fact, I think we have
a bit of a tradition,

00:06:39.809 --> 00:06:40.972
especially in the West,

00:06:40.996 --> 00:06:43.594
of a kind of academically blinkered hubris

00:06:43.618 --> 00:06:47.043
that has kept science historically
an enterprise for the elite.

00:06:47.067 --> 00:06:48.959
And I think although that's moved on,

00:06:48.983 --> 00:06:52.578
it continues to be
its downfall on occasion.

00:06:53.673 --> 00:06:58.116
So here's my example from history

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.542
and my takedown of a scientific hero.

00:07:02.458 --> 00:07:03.944
Sir Ernest Shackleton

00:07:03.968 --> 00:07:07.867
and his Trans-Antarctic Expedition
more than a century ago,

00:07:07.891 --> 00:07:10.305
the celebrated ill-fated adventure.

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:11.480
On his way there,

00:07:11.504 --> 00:07:14.501
Shackleton just didn't listen
to the whalers in South Georgia.

00:07:14.525 --> 00:07:18.366
They knew that region, and they told him
you won't get through the ice this year.

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:21.217
It's too widespread, it's too far north,
it's too dangerous.

00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:22.575
And look what happened.

00:07:22.599 --> 00:07:24.876
I mean, granted, that great adventure,

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.073
that story of heroic leadership
that we still tell,

00:07:28.097 --> 00:07:30.199
where he saved
every single one of his men,

00:07:30.223 --> 00:07:33.493
we wouldn't be telling that story
if he'd just hightailed it for home

00:07:33.517 --> 00:07:34.675
and taken their advice.

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:35.902
But it cost him his ship,

00:07:35.926 --> 00:07:38.772
I would imagine quite a lot
of cold injuries among the team,

00:07:38.796 --> 00:07:40.044
a good few cases of PTSD

00:07:40.068 --> 00:07:42.791
and Mrs. Chippy,
the ship's cat, had to be shot

00:07:42.815 --> 00:07:46.737
because the team couldn't afford
any extra food as they fought to survive.

00:07:47.616 --> 00:07:50.296
Now, that was all a very long time ago,

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.278
but as I've prepared for this talk,

00:07:52.302 --> 00:07:55.508
I've revisited some of the stories
that I have covered,

00:07:55.532 --> 00:08:00.557
where these really unusual collaborations
made a real positive difference.

00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:02.656
So I spoke to former poachers

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.157
whose knowledge of where
they used to hunt illegally

00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:08.387
is now really important
in conservation projects

00:08:08.411 --> 00:08:10.162
in those same places.

00:08:10.186 --> 00:08:11.980
And I spoke to an amazing artist

00:08:12.004 --> 00:08:14.652
whose own experience
of mental health struggles

00:08:14.676 --> 00:08:19.386
has actually paved the way for him
to take a role in designing and creating

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:23.404
a new, really innovative and beautiful
mental health ward in a hospital.

00:08:24.341 --> 00:08:27.462
Most recently, I worked here,
in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone,

00:08:27.486 --> 00:08:30.758
with a team of scientists
that have been working there for decades.

00:08:30.782 --> 00:08:33.181
One of their experiments
growing crops in that area

00:08:33.205 --> 00:08:35.329
has now turned into this.

00:08:35.353 --> 00:08:37.469
It's Chernobyl's first vodka.

00:08:37.493 --> 00:08:40.388
(Laughter)

00:08:42.925 --> 00:08:45.893
It's pretty good, too! I've tasted it.

00:08:45.917 --> 00:08:48.815
And this is actually,
although it looks like a niche product,

00:08:48.839 --> 00:08:53.503
it's set to be the first consumer product
to come out of the exclusion zone

00:08:53.527 --> 00:08:55.252
since the nuclear accident.

00:08:55.276 --> 00:08:58.431
And that's actually the result
of years of conversation

00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:02.106
with local communities who still live
on the periphery of that abandoned land

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:06.094
and want to know when they can --
and if they can -- safely grow food

00:09:06.118 --> 00:09:09.491
and build businesses and rebuild
their communities and their lives.

00:09:09.929 --> 00:09:12.108
This was a product of humility,

00:09:12.132 --> 00:09:13.345
of listening,

00:09:13.369 --> 00:09:16.702
and I saw that in spades
when I visited Pátzcuaro.

00:09:17.058 --> 00:09:20.506
So I watched as a decades-experienced
conservation biologist

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:21.846
called Gerardo Garcia

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.836
listened and watched super carefully

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.351
as a nun in a full habit
and wimple and latex gloves

00:09:26.375 --> 00:09:29.408
showed him how, if you tap
an achoque on the head really gently,

00:09:29.432 --> 00:09:32.667
it'll open its mouth so you can quickly
get a DNA swab with a Q-tip.

00:09:32.691 --> 00:09:34.180
(Laughter)

00:09:34.204 --> 00:09:39.230
When scientists team up with,
look to and defer to people

00:09:39.254 --> 00:09:42.424
who have a really valuable perspective
on what they're trying to do

00:09:42.448 --> 00:09:44.014
but a totally different outlook,

00:09:44.038 --> 00:09:46.171
something really special can happen.

00:09:48.163 --> 00:09:53.609
Now, there is a truly global
and a very, very ambitious example of this

00:09:53.633 --> 00:09:57.448
called the International Panel
on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.

00:09:57.472 --> 00:10:00.312
Now, that is not a snappy title,
but stick with me.

00:10:00.336 --> 00:10:02.818
This organization includes
more than 130 countries,

00:10:02.842 --> 00:10:06.530
and it's aiming to do nothing less
than assess the state of the natural world

00:10:06.554 --> 00:10:08.605
across our entire planet.

00:10:08.629 --> 00:10:10.850
So it recently published
this global assessment

00:10:10.874 --> 00:10:12.050
on the state of nature,

00:10:12.074 --> 00:10:15.164
and that could be the foundation
for an international agreement

00:10:15.188 --> 00:10:18.390
where all of those nations could sign up
to finally take action

00:10:18.414 --> 00:10:21.753
to tackle the biodiversity crisis
that's happening on planet Earth

00:10:21.777 --> 00:10:23.070
right now.

00:10:23.682 --> 00:10:27.984
Now, I know from trying to communicate,
trying to report on reports like this,

00:10:28.008 --> 00:10:30.191
on assessments like this
for a broad audience,

00:10:30.215 --> 00:10:34.447
that these big international groups
can seem so high-level

00:10:34.471 --> 00:10:37.277
as to be kind of
out of reach and nebulous,

00:10:37.301 --> 00:10:40.053
but there's a group of human beings
at the center of them,

00:10:40.077 --> 00:10:41.289
the report's authors,

00:10:41.313 --> 00:10:43.675
who have this formidable task
of bringing together

00:10:43.699 --> 00:10:46.097
all of that biological
and ecological information

00:10:46.121 --> 00:10:48.162
that paints a clear and accurate picture

00:10:48.186 --> 00:10:50.829
of the state of the natural world.

00:10:50.853 --> 00:10:53.593
And 10 years before this panel
even set out to do that,

00:10:53.617 --> 00:10:55.199
to put that assessment together,

00:10:55.223 --> 00:10:58.541
they created what's called
a "cultural concept framework."

00:10:58.565 --> 00:11:02.885
This is essentially
a cultural concept translation dictionary

00:11:02.909 --> 00:11:07.202
for all of the different ways
that we talk about the natural world.

00:11:07.226 --> 00:11:09.409
So it formally recognizes, for example,

00:11:09.433 --> 00:11:13.492
that "Mother Earth" and "nature"
means the same thing.

00:11:13.516 --> 00:11:16.299
And what that means is that
Indigenous and local knowledge

00:11:16.323 --> 00:11:18.134
can be brought into the same document

00:11:18.158 --> 00:11:20.646
and given the weight
and merit that it deserves

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:26.842
in that assessment of what state
our natural environment is in.

00:11:26.866 --> 00:11:28.665
And that is absolutely critical,

00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:33.197
because an Inuit hunter might never
publish in an academic journal,

00:11:33.221 --> 00:11:38.031
but I'll bet you she knows more about
the changes to her home Arctic community

00:11:38.055 --> 00:11:39.524
because of climate change

00:11:39.548 --> 00:11:43.538
than a scientist who spent many years
going to and from that region

00:11:43.562 --> 00:11:45.027
taking measurements.

00:11:45.496 --> 00:11:49.405
And collectively, Indigenous people
are the caretakers

00:11:49.429 --> 00:11:54.817
of an estimated 25 percent
of the entire global land surface,

00:11:54.841 --> 00:11:58.626
including some of the most biodiverse
places on the planet.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.764
So imagine how much we're missing

00:12:01.788 --> 00:12:04.027
if we don't cross
those cultural boundaries,

00:12:04.051 --> 00:12:05.329
or at least try to,

00:12:05.353 --> 00:12:07.780
when we're trying to figure out
how the world works

00:12:07.804 --> 00:12:09.120
and how to protect it.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.455
Every single research proposal
is a new opportunity to do exactly that.

00:12:15.479 --> 00:12:19.084
So what if, every time
a research project was proposed,

00:12:19.108 --> 00:12:22.861
it had to include a suggestion
of a person or a group of people --

00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:26.427
local farmers, Indigenous
community leaders, nuns --

00:12:26.451 --> 00:12:28.852
that researchers wanted
to bring into the fold,

00:12:28.876 --> 00:12:31.420
invite into their team and listen to?

00:12:32.267 --> 00:12:34.813
I just want to let
Sister Ofelia give her view

00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:38.349
of why she is so particularly
driven and dedicated

00:12:38.373 --> 00:12:40.512
to the survival of the achoque.

00:12:42.466 --> 00:12:47.265
(Audio) VG: Sister Ofelia, do you think
that saving this species from extinction,

00:12:47.289 --> 00:12:49.928
is that part of your work for God?

00:12:50.545 --> 00:12:55.257
(Audio) SO: (speaks in Spanish)

00:12:55.281 --> 00:12:57.930
(Audio) (Interpreter voice-over)
It's the responsibility

00:12:57.954 --> 00:12:59.108
of every human being

00:12:59.132 --> 00:13:00.916
not to harm those who live around us.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.169
That's all living things.

00:13:03.193 --> 00:13:08.536
We're all created not only just to survive
but to be happy and to make others happy.

00:13:09.143 --> 00:13:13.680
All of us here are providing happiness
by protecting this animal,

00:13:13.704 --> 00:13:19.114
and we're also making Him happy.

00:13:19.138 --> 00:13:23.940
(Audio) (Nuns singing)

00:13:27.453 --> 00:13:30.893
VG: I feel like I should sort of slink off
and let the nuns sing me out,

00:13:30.917 --> 00:13:32.736
because it sounds so lovely.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.029
But did you hear that?

00:13:34.053 --> 00:13:35.965
"We're providing happiness."

00:13:35.989 --> 00:13:38.341
Now, that's not a protocol
you'd ever see outlined

00:13:38.365 --> 00:13:40.673
in any formal research project proposal --

00:13:40.697 --> 00:13:41.752
(Laughter)

00:13:41.776 --> 00:13:45.962
but it's the impetus behind what's become
the most successful breeding program

00:13:45.986 --> 00:13:47.141
in the world

00:13:47.165 --> 00:13:50.654
of an animal that was on the very
brink of being wiped out.

00:13:50.678 --> 00:13:52.935
And isn't that just wonderful?

00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:54.650
Thank you.

00:13:54.674 --> 00:13:57.533
(Applause)
