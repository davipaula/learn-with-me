Reviewer: Camille MartÃ­nez

00:00:12.738 --> 00:00:14.952
I have a tendency to assume the worst,

00:00:15.757 --> 00:00:18.620
and once in a while,
this habit plays tricks on me.

00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:21.925
For example, if I feel
unexpected pain in my body

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.456
that I have not experienced before
and that I cannot attribute,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.000
then all of a sudden, my mind
might turn a tense back into heart disease

00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:32.920
or calf muscle pain
into deep vein thrombosis.

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:37.217
But so far, I haven't been diagnosed
with any deadly or incurable disease.

00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:39.653
Sometimes things just hurt
for no clear reason.

00:00:41.098 --> 00:00:43.318
But not everyone is as lucky as me.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.215
Every year, more than
50 million people die worldwide.

00:00:48.287 --> 00:00:51.820
Especially in high-income
economies like ours,

00:00:51.844 --> 00:00:56.599
a large fraction of deaths is caused
by slowly progressing diseases:

00:00:56.623 --> 00:01:00.931
heart disease, chronic lung disease,
cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes,

00:01:00.955 --> 00:01:02.325
just to name a few.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.804
Now, humanity has made tremendous progress
in diagnosing and treating many of these.

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:12.060
But we are at a stage
where further advancement in health

00:01:12.084 --> 00:01:15.374
cannot be achieved only
by developing new treatments.

00:01:15.398 --> 00:01:17.798
And this becomes evident
when we look at one aspect

00:01:17.822 --> 00:01:20.188
that many of these
diseases have in common:

00:01:21.418 --> 00:01:24.246
the probability for successful treatment

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.912
strongly depends on
when treatment is started.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.814
But a disease is typically only detected
once symptoms occur.

00:01:31.632 --> 00:01:36.025
The problem here is that, in fact,
many diseases can remain asymptomatic,

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.902
hence undetected,
for a long period of time.

00:01:39.902 --> 00:01:43.803
Because of this, there is
a persisting need for new ways

00:01:43.827 --> 00:01:45.775
of detecting disease at early stage,

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.937
way before any symptoms occur.

00:01:49.135 --> 00:01:51.411
In health care, this is called screening.

00:01:51.435 --> 00:01:54.600
And as defined by
the World Health Organization,

00:01:54.624 --> 00:02:00.282
screening is "the presumptive
identification of unrecognized disease

00:02:00.306 --> 00:02:02.867
in an apparently healthy person,

00:02:02.891 --> 00:02:06.680
by means of tests ... that can be applied
rapidly and easily ..."

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.618
That's a long definition,
so let me repeat it:

00:02:10.237 --> 00:02:13.722
identification of unrecognized disease

00:02:13.746 --> 00:02:16.230
in an apparently healthy person

00:02:16.254 --> 00:02:20.268
by means of tests that can be applied
both rapidly and easily.

00:02:20.292 --> 00:02:23.671
And I want to put special emphasis
on the words "rapidly" and "easily"

00:02:23.695 --> 00:02:25.945
because many of the existing
screening methods

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:27.628
are exactly the opposite.

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:30.888
And those of you
who have undergone colonoscopy

00:02:30.912 --> 00:02:34.111
as part of a screening program
for colorectal cancer

00:02:34.135 --> 00:02:35.482
will know what I mean.

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.285
Obviously, there's a variety
of medical tools available

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:41.838
to perform screening tests.

00:02:42.298 --> 00:02:45.984
This ranges from imaging techniques
such as radiography

00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:48.138
or magnetic resonance imaging

00:02:48.162 --> 00:02:50.166
to the analysis of blood or tissue.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.106
We have all had such tests.

00:02:53.344 --> 00:02:56.917
But there's one medium
that for long has been overlooked:

00:02:57.674 --> 00:03:00.416
a medium that is easily accessible,

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.461
basically nondepletable,

00:03:02.485 --> 00:03:05.732
and it holds tremendous promise
for medical analysis.

00:03:06.994 --> 00:03:08.522
And that is our breath.

00:03:10.514 --> 00:03:13.895
Human breath is essentially
composed of five components:

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:21.325
nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide,
water and argon.

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.748
But besides these five, there are
hundreds of other components

00:03:24.772 --> 00:03:27.155
that are present in very low quantity.

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:29.732
These are called volatile
organic compounds,

00:03:29.756 --> 00:03:32.089
and we release hundreds,
even thousands of them

00:03:32.113 --> 00:03:33.872
every time we exhale.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.479
The analysis of these volatile
organic compounds in our breath

00:03:38.503 --> 00:03:40.204
is called breath analysis.

00:03:41.545 --> 00:03:45.309
In fact, I believe that many of you
have already experienced breath analysis.

00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:48.934
Imagine: you're driving home
late at night,

00:03:48.958 --> 00:03:51.656
when suddenly, there's
a friendly police officer

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.472
who asks you kindly but firmly

00:03:54.496 --> 00:03:57.899
to pull over and blow
into a device like this one.

00:03:59.486 --> 00:04:02.709
This is an alcohol breath tester

00:04:02.733 --> 00:04:06.440
that is used to measure
the ethanol concentration in your breath

00:04:06.464 --> 00:04:09.821
and determine whether driving
in your condition is a clever idea.

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:12.456
Now, I'd say my driving was pretty good,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.700
but let me check.

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:16.715
(Beep)

00:04:20.445 --> 00:04:23.405
0.0, so nothing
to worry about, all fine.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:24.696
(Laughter)

00:04:26.298 --> 00:04:28.959
Now imagine a device like this one,

00:04:28.983 --> 00:04:31.927
that does not only measure
alcohol levels in your breath,

00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:35.767
but that detects diseases
like the ones I've shown you

00:04:35.791 --> 00:04:37.507
and potentially many more.

00:04:38.868 --> 00:04:42.666
The concept of correlating
the smell of a person's breath

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.810
with certain medical conditions,

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:47.254
in fact, dates back to Ancient Greece.

00:04:47.905 --> 00:04:52.876
But only recently, research efforts
on breath analysis have skyrocketed,

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.307
and what once was a dream
is now becoming reality.

00:04:57.307 --> 00:05:00.321
And let me pull up this list again
that I showed you earlier.

00:05:01.047 --> 00:05:03.813
For the majority of diseases listed here,

00:05:04.495 --> 00:05:06.688
there's substantial scientific evidence

00:05:06.712 --> 00:05:10.369
suggesting that the disease
could be detected by breath analysis.

00:05:11.917 --> 00:05:13.612
But how does it work, exactly?

00:05:14.421 --> 00:05:17.199
The essential part is a sensor device

00:05:17.223 --> 00:05:20.435
that detects the volatile
organic compounds in our breath.

00:05:21.364 --> 00:05:24.294
Simply put: when exposed
to a breath sample,

00:05:24.318 --> 00:05:27.002
the sensor outputs a complex signature

00:05:27.026 --> 00:05:31.006
that results from the mixture of volatile
organic compounds that we exhale.

00:05:32.141 --> 00:05:36.457
Now, this signature represents
a fingerprint of your metabolism,

00:05:36.481 --> 00:05:37.646
your microbiome

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.273
and the biochemical processes
that occur in your body.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.573
If you have a disease,

00:05:43.597 --> 00:05:45.884
your organism will change,

00:05:45.908 --> 00:05:48.868
and so will the composition
of your exhaled breath.

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:54.609
And then the only thing that is left to do
is to correlate a certain signature

00:05:54.633 --> 00:05:57.739
with the presence or absence
of certain medical conditions.

00:05:59.921 --> 00:06:03.156
The technology promises
several undeniable benefits.

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:06.816
Firstly, the sensor can be miniaturized

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.686
and integrated into small,
handheld devices

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.548
like this alcohol breath tester.

00:06:12.437 --> 00:06:15.450
This would allow the test to be used
in many different settings

00:06:15.474 --> 00:06:17.248
and even at home,

00:06:17.272 --> 00:06:19.266
so that a visit at the doctor's office

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.049
is not needed each time
a test shall be performed.

00:06:22.946 --> 00:06:26.326
Secondly, breath analysis is noninvasive

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.997
and can be as simple as blowing
into an alcohol breath tester.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.894
Such simplicity and ease of use
would reduce patient burden

00:06:35.918 --> 00:06:39.361
and provide an incentive
for broad adoption of the technology.

00:06:39.973 --> 00:06:44.081
And thirdly, the technology is so flexible

00:06:44.105 --> 00:06:46.345
that the same device could be used

00:06:46.369 --> 00:06:49.509
to detect a broad range
of medical conditions.

00:06:50.224 --> 00:06:54.909
Breath analysis could be used to screen
for multiple diseases at the same time.

00:06:56.195 --> 00:06:59.526
Nowadays, each disease typically requires
a different medical tool

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.006
to perform a screening test.

00:07:01.561 --> 00:07:04.645
But this means you can only find
what you're looking for.

00:07:06.637 --> 00:07:10.496
With all of these features,
breath analysis is predestined

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.584
to deliver what many traditional
screening tests are lacking.

00:07:14.671 --> 00:07:16.310
And most importantly,

00:07:16.334 --> 00:07:19.684
all of these features should
eventually provide us

00:07:19.708 --> 00:07:22.214
with a platform for medical analysis

00:07:22.238 --> 00:07:25.943
that can operate at attractively
low cost per test.

00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:30.963
On the contrary, existing medical tools

00:07:30.987 --> 00:07:33.373
often lead to rather high cost per test.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.198
Then, in order to keep costs down,

00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:38.832
the number of tests
needs to be restricted,

00:07:39.562 --> 00:07:42.803
and this means (a) that the tests
can only be performed

00:07:42.827 --> 00:07:47.511
on a narrow part of the population,
for example, the high-risk population;

00:07:47.535 --> 00:07:52.690
and (b) that the number of tests
per person needs to be kept at a minimum.

00:07:53.459 --> 00:07:55.303
But wouldn't it actually be beneficial

00:07:55.327 --> 00:07:58.287
if the test was performed
on a larger group of people,

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:02.559
and more often and over a longer period
of time for each individual?

00:08:03.845 --> 00:08:07.706
Especially the latter would give access
to something very valuable

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:09.997
that is called longitudinal data.

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:15.052
Longitudinal data is a data set
that tracks the same patient

00:08:15.076 --> 00:08:17.572
over the course of many months or years.

00:08:19.318 --> 00:08:24.368
Nowadays, medical decisions
are often based on a limited data set,

00:08:24.392 --> 00:08:27.584
where only a glimpse
of a patient's medical history

00:08:27.608 --> 00:08:29.662
is available for decision-making.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.509
In such a case,

00:08:32.533 --> 00:08:35.326
abnormalities are typically detected

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.916
by comparing a patient's health profile

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.212
to the average health profile
of a reference population.

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:46.337
Longitudinal data would
open up a new dimension

00:08:46.361 --> 00:08:49.229
and allow abnormalities to be detected

00:08:49.253 --> 00:08:51.950
based on a patient's own medical history.

00:08:52.862 --> 00:08:55.685
This will pave the way
for personalized treatment.

00:08:56.741 --> 00:08:58.305
Sounds pretty great, right?

00:08:59.194 --> 00:09:02.169
Now you will certainly have a question
that is something like,

00:09:02.193 --> 00:09:06.988
"If the technology is as great as he says,
then why aren't we using it today?"

00:09:07.012 --> 00:09:09.490
And the only answer I can give you is:

00:09:09.514 --> 00:09:12.094
not everything is as easy as it sounds.

00:09:12.983 --> 00:09:16.470
There are technical
challenges, for example.

00:09:16.494 --> 00:09:19.508
There's the need for
extremely reliable sensors

00:09:19.532 --> 00:09:22.800
that can detect mixtures
of volatile organic compounds

00:09:22.824 --> 00:09:24.917
with sufficient reproducibility.

00:09:25.629 --> 00:09:28.064
And another technical challenge is this:

00:09:28.088 --> 00:09:33.074
How do you sample a person's breath
in a very defined manner

00:09:33.098 --> 00:09:35.446
so that the sampling process itself

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:38.123
does not alter the result of the analysis?

00:09:39.187 --> 00:09:40.975
And there's the need for data.

00:09:41.556 --> 00:09:45.514
Breath analysis needs
to be validated in clinical trials,

00:09:45.538 --> 00:09:48.030
and enough data needs to be collected

00:09:48.054 --> 00:09:52.296
so that individual conditions
can be measured against baselines.

00:09:53.167 --> 00:09:55.640
Breath analysis can only succeed

00:09:55.664 --> 00:09:58.437
if a large enough data set
can be generated

00:09:58.461 --> 00:10:00.811
and made available for broad use.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.880
If breath analysis
holds up to its promises,

00:10:06.745 --> 00:10:09.271
this is a technology
that could truly aid us

00:10:09.295 --> 00:10:11.538
to transform our health care system --

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.564
transform it from a reactive system

00:10:15.588 --> 00:10:18.750
where treatment is triggered
by symptoms of disease

00:10:18.774 --> 00:10:20.789
to a proactive system,

00:10:20.813 --> 00:10:24.027
where disease detection,
diagnosis and treatment

00:10:24.051 --> 00:10:25.935
can happen at early stage,

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:28.058
way before any symptoms occur.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.976
Now this brings me to my last point,
and it's a fundamental one.

00:10:33.537 --> 00:10:35.526
What exactly is a disease?

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:40.625
Imagine that breath analysis
can be commercialized as I describe it,

00:10:40.649 --> 00:10:43.255
and early detection becomes routine.

00:10:44.417 --> 00:10:46.721
A problem that remains
is, in fact, a problem

00:10:46.745 --> 00:10:49.733
that any screening activity has to face

00:10:49.757 --> 00:10:51.578
because, for many diseases,

00:10:51.602 --> 00:10:55.426
it is often impossible to predict
with sufficient certainty

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:57.992
whether the disease
would ever cause any symptoms

00:10:58.016 --> 00:11:00.138
or put a person's life at risk.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.549
This is called overdiagnosis,

00:11:03.573 --> 00:11:05.211
and it leads to a dilemma.

00:11:05.927 --> 00:11:08.011
If a disease is identified,

00:11:08.035 --> 00:11:10.079
you could decide not to treat it

00:11:10.103 --> 00:11:14.074
because there's a certain probability
that you would never suffer from it.

00:11:14.955 --> 00:11:16.454
But how much would you suffer

00:11:16.478 --> 00:11:19.865
just from knowing that you have
a potentially deadly disease?

00:11:19.889 --> 00:11:22.813
And wouldn't you actually regret
that the disease was detected

00:11:22.823 --> 00:11:24.080
in the first place?

00:11:25.281 --> 00:11:29.169
Your second option
is to undergo early treatment

00:11:29.193 --> 00:11:30.843
with the hope for curing it.

00:11:31.485 --> 00:11:34.314
But often, this would not come
without side effects.

00:11:37.623 --> 00:11:39.727
To be precise:

00:11:39.751 --> 00:11:42.325
the bigger problem is not overdiagnosis,

00:11:42.349 --> 00:11:43.802
it's overtreatment,

00:11:43.826 --> 00:11:46.841
because not every disease
has to be treated immediately

00:11:46.865 --> 00:11:48.925
just because a treatment is available.

00:11:51.441 --> 00:11:54.139
The increasing adoption
of routine screening

00:11:54.163 --> 00:11:55.912
will raise the question:

00:11:57.082 --> 00:12:01.173
What do we call a disease
that can rationalize treatment,

00:12:01.197 --> 00:12:05.785
and what is just an abnormality
that should not be a source of concern?

00:12:07.404 --> 00:12:12.336
My hopes are that routine screening
using breath analysis

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.120
can provide enough data and insight

00:12:15.144 --> 00:12:19.690
so that at some point,
we'll be able to break this dilemma

00:12:19.714 --> 00:12:22.144
and predict with sufficient certainty

00:12:22.168 --> 00:12:24.858
whether and when to treat at early stage.

00:12:26.794 --> 00:12:31.513
Our breath and the mixture of volatile
organic compounds that we exhale

00:12:31.537 --> 00:12:36.207
hold tremendous amounts of information
on our physiological condition.

00:12:37.262 --> 00:12:40.602
With what we know today,
we have only scratched the surface.

00:12:41.993 --> 00:12:46.234
As we collect more and more data
and breath profiles across the population,

00:12:46.258 --> 00:12:50.790
including all varieties of gender,
age, origin and lifestyle,

00:12:50.814 --> 00:12:53.147
the power of breath analysis
should increase.

00:12:54.147 --> 00:12:59.725
And eventually, breath analysis
should provide us with a powerful tool

00:12:59.749 --> 00:13:04.215
not only to proactively detect
specific diseases

00:13:04.239 --> 00:13:07.888
but to predict
and ultimately prevent them.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.728
And this should be enough motivation

00:13:11.752 --> 00:13:15.935
to embrace the opportunities
and challenges

00:13:15.959 --> 00:13:18.420
that breath analysis can provide,

00:13:18.444 --> 00:13:21.846
even for people that are not
part-time hypochondriacs like me.

00:13:22.532 --> 00:13:23.689
Thank you.

00:13:23.713 --> 00:13:27.730
