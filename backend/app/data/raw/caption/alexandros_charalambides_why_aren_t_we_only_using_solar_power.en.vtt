00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:09.317
We have some good reasons to completely

00:00:09.317 --> 00:00:11.235
switch over to solar power.

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:12.859
It's cheaper in many cases,

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:14.809
and definitely more sustainable

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.213
than our dependance on traditional power plants

00:00:17.213 --> 00:00:18.906
that use resources like coal,

00:00:18.906 --> 00:00:20.950
which will eventually run out.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.035
So why don't we replace these

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:24.570
traditional plants with solar energy?

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.027
Because there's one factor that makes

00:00:26.027 --> 00:00:28.476
solar power very unpredictable:

00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:30.052
cloud cover.

00:00:30.052 --> 00:00:32.223
As the sun's rays move towards Earth,

00:00:32.223 --> 00:00:34.652
some get absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere,

00:00:34.652 --> 00:00:36.755
some are reflected back into outer space,

00:00:36.755 --> 00:00:39.887
but the rest make it to the Earth's surface.

00:00:39.887 --> 00:00:41.436
The ones that aren't deviated

00:00:41.436 --> 00:00:43.516
are called direct irradiance.

00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:45.359
The ones that are deflected by clouds

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.659
are called diffuse irradiance.

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:50.509
And those rays that first get reflected by a surface,

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:51.780
like a nearby building,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.379
before reaching the solar energy system

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.610
are called reflected irradiance.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.256
But before we can examine how clouds

00:00:58.256 --> 00:01:01.281
affect the sun's rays and electricity production,

00:01:01.281 --> 00:01:04.500
let's see how these solar energy systems work.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.868
First up, we have solar towers.

00:01:06.868 --> 00:01:08.414
These are made up of a central tower

00:01:08.414 --> 00:01:11.120
surrounded by a huge field of mirrors

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.034
that track the sun's path and focus

00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:16.651
only the direct rays onto a single point on the tower,

00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:19.434
kind of like an eager beachgoer.

00:01:19.434 --> 00:01:21.130
The heat generated by these rays

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.706
is so immense that it can be used to boil water

00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:27.720
producing steam that drives a traditional turbine,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.545
which makes electricity.

00:01:29.545 --> 00:01:31.515
But when we say solar energy systems,

00:01:31.515 --> 00:01:34.252
we're usually talking about photovoltaics,

00:01:34.252 --> 00:01:35.704
or solar panels,

00:01:35.704 --> 00:01:37.325
which are the systems most commonly used

00:01:37.325 --> 00:01:38.945
to generate solar power.

00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:39.916
In solar panels,

00:01:39.916 --> 00:01:42.795
photons from the sun's rays hit the surface of a panel,

00:01:42.795 --> 00:01:44.465
and electrons are released

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:46.818
to get an electric current going.

00:01:46.818 --> 00:01:49.818
Solar panels can use all types of irradiance,

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:53.556
while solar towers can only use direct irradiance,

00:01:53.556 --> 00:01:56.218
and this is where clouds become important

00:01:56.218 --> 00:01:58.290
because depending on their type and location

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.537
relative to the sun,

00:01:59.537 --> 00:02:01.645
they can either increase or decrease

00:02:01.645 --> 00:02:04.122
the amount of electricity produced.

00:02:04.122 --> 00:02:06.236
For instance, even a few cumulus clouds

00:02:06.236 --> 00:02:07.690
in front of the sun can reduce

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.042
the electricity production in solar towers

00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:14.461
to almost zero because of this dependence on direct rays.

00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:16.693
In solar panels, those clouds would decrease

00:02:16.693 --> 00:02:18.200
energy output as well,

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.435
though not as much

00:02:19.435 --> 00:02:22.710
because solar panels can use all types of irradiance.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.160
However, all this depends on the clouds exact positioning.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.468
Due to reflection, or a particular phenomeon

00:02:28.468 --> 00:02:30.344
called Mie scattering,

00:02:30.344 --> 00:02:33.125
the sun's rays can actually be focused forward

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:36.566
by clouds to create a more than 50% increase

00:02:36.566 --> 00:02:39.681
in the solar irradiance reaching a solar panel.

00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:42.231
If this potential increase isn't accounted for,

00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:44.780
it could damage the solar panel.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.901
Why does this matter?

00:02:45.901 --> 00:02:47.731
Well, you wouldn't want this lesson to stop

00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:51.127
just because a cloud passed over the panel on your roof.

00:02:51.127 --> 00:02:54.429
In solar towers, huge tanks of molten salt or oil

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:56.808
can be used to store any excess heat

00:02:56.808 --> 00:02:58.292
and use it when needed,

00:02:58.292 --> 00:02:59.736
so that's how they manage the problem

00:02:59.736 --> 00:03:02.525
of fluctuating solar irradiance to smooth out

00:03:02.525 --> 00:03:03.999
electricity production.

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:05.345
But in the case of solar panels,

00:03:05.345 --> 00:03:07.905
there currently isn't any way to affordably

00:03:07.905 --> 00:03:09.730
store extra energy.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.717
That's where traditional power plants come in

00:03:11.717 --> 00:03:13.841
because to correct for any fluctuations

00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:15.815
in these solar powered plants,

00:03:15.815 --> 00:03:18.149
extra electricity from traditional sources

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:20.429
always needs to be available.

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:22.869
But then why aren't these tradtional power plants

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.337
just used as a backup,

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:26.075
instead of us humans depending on them

00:03:26.075 --> 00:03:28.296
as our main sources of energy?

00:03:28.296 --> 00:03:30.113
Because it's impossible for an employee

00:03:30.113 --> 00:03:32.248
at a coal fired or a nuclear plant

00:03:32.248 --> 00:03:33.507
to turn a knob to produce

00:03:33.507 --> 00:03:35.427
more or less electricity depending

00:03:35.427 --> 00:03:37.834
on how many clouds there are in the sky.

00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:40.521
The response time would simply be too slow.

00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:42.819
Instead, to accommodate these fluctuations,

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.718
some extra electricity from traditional power plants

00:03:45.718 --> 00:03:48.036
is always being produced.

00:03:48.036 --> 00:03:49.496
On clear sky days,

00:03:49.496 --> 00:03:51.578
that extra electricity might be wasted,

00:03:51.578 --> 00:03:53.557
but when cloudy skies prevail,

00:03:53.557 --> 00:03:55.467
it's what fills the gap.

00:03:55.467 --> 00:03:56.930
This is what we currently depend on

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.861
for a constant supply of energy.

00:03:58.861 --> 00:04:00.186
For this reason, a lot of researchers

00:04:00.186 --> 00:04:02.632
are interested in forcasting the motion

00:04:02.632 --> 00:04:05.835
and formation of clouds through satellite images

00:04:05.835 --> 00:04:07.883
or cameras that look up at the sky

00:04:07.883 --> 00:04:10.765
to maximize the energy from solar power plants

00:04:10.765 --> 00:04:13.038
and minimize energy waste.

00:04:13.038 --> 00:04:14.365
If we could accomplish that,

00:04:14.365 --> 00:04:16.484
you'd be able to enjoy this video

00:04:16.484 --> 00:04:18.486
powered solely by the sun's rays,

00:04:18.486 --> 00:04:20.067
no matter what the weather,

00:04:20.067 --> 00:04:21.845
although if the sun is shining,

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:24.070
you may be tempted to venture outside

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.034
to go and do a different kind of cloud gazing.
