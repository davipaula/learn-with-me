00:00:06.542 --> 00:00:09.560
How much would you pay 
for a bouquet of tulips?

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.292
A few dollars? A hundred dollars?

00:00:12.292 --> 00:00:14.821
How about a million dollars?

00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:16.142
Probably not.

00:00:16.142 --> 00:00:19.002
Well, how much would you 
pay for this house,

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:23.244
or partial ownership of a website
that sells pet supplies?

00:00:23.244 --> 00:00:25.072
At different points in time,

00:00:25.072 --> 00:00:28.925
tulips, real estate and stock in pets.com

00:00:28.925 --> 00:00:32.877
have all sold for much more 
than they were worth.

00:00:32.877 --> 00:00:38.379
In each instance, the price rose and rose
and then abruptly plummeted.

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.742
Economists call this a bubble.

00:00:40.742 --> 00:00:43.316
So what is exactly is going on 
with a bubble?

00:00:43.316 --> 00:00:47.067
Well, let's start with the tulips
to get a better idea.

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:51.787
The 17th century saw the Netherlands
enter the Dutch golden age.

00:00:51.787 --> 00:00:57.188
By the 1630s, Amsterdam was an important
port and commercial center.

00:00:57.188 --> 00:01:01.203
Dutch ships imported spices
from Asia in huge quantities

00:01:01.203 --> 00:01:03.381
to earn profits in Europe.

00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:07.983
So Amsterdam was brimming with wealthy, 
skilled merchants and traders

00:01:07.983 --> 00:01:11.350
who displayed their prosperity 
by living in mansions

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.182
surrounded by flower gardens.

00:01:14.182 --> 00:01:17.387
And there was one flower 
in particularly high demand:

00:01:17.387 --> 00:01:18.906
the tulip.

00:01:18.906 --> 00:01:21.601
The tulip was brought 
to Europe on trading vessels

00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:23.372
that sailed from the East.

00:01:23.372 --> 00:01:26.487
Because of this, it was considered
an exotic flower

00:01:26.487 --> 00:01:28.379
that was also difficult to grow,

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:32.197
since it could take years 
for a single tulip to bloom.

00:01:32.197 --> 00:01:36.149
During the 1630s, an outbreak 
of tulip breaking virus

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.324
made select flowers even more beautiful

00:01:39.324 --> 00:01:43.377
by lining petals with multicolor,
flame-like streaks.

00:01:43.377 --> 00:01:47.070
A tulip like this was scarcer
than a normal tulip

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.120
and as a result, prices for these flowers
started to rise,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.011
and with them, the tulip's popularity.

00:01:54.011 --> 00:01:57.766
It wasn't long before the tulip 
became a nationwide sensation

00:01:57.766 --> 00:02:00.689
and tulip mania was born.

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.826
A mania occurs when there is an upward
movement of price

00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:07.268
combined with a willingness 
to pay large sums of money

00:02:07.268 --> 00:02:11.508
for something valued much lower
in intrinsic value.

00:02:11.508 --> 00:02:16.224
A recent example of this 
is the dot-com mania of the 1990s.

00:02:16.224 --> 00:02:21.424
Stocks in new, exciting websites 
were like the tulips of the 17th century.

00:02:21.424 --> 00:02:23.584
Everybody wanted some.

00:02:23.584 --> 00:02:27.240
The more people who wanted the tulip,
the higher the price could go.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.682
At one point, a single tulip bulb

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:35.685
sold for more than ten times
the annual salary of a skilled craftsman.

00:02:35.685 --> 00:02:36.741
In the stock market,

00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:41.201
the price of stock is based on the supply 
and demand of investors.

00:02:41.201 --> 00:02:42.850
Stock prices tend to rise

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.706
when it seems like a company 
will earn more in the future.

00:02:46.706 --> 00:02:49.147
Investors might then buy more
of the stock,

00:02:49.147 --> 00:02:53.461
raising the prices even further
due to an increased demand.

00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:57.528
This can result in a feedback loop
where investors get caught up in the hype

00:02:57.528 --> 00:03:01.766
and ultimately drive prices 
far above intrinsic value,

00:03:01.766 --> 00:03:03.852
creating a bubble.

00:03:03.852 --> 00:03:07.702
All that is needed for a mania to end
and for a bubble to burst

00:03:07.702 --> 00:03:11.068
is the collective realization 
that the price of the stock,

00:03:11.068 --> 00:03:14.350
or a tulip,
far exceeds its worth.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.691
That's what happened with both manias.

00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:19.133
Suddenly the demand ended.

00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:21.674
Prices were pushed to staggering lows,

00:03:21.674 --> 00:03:22.918
and pop!

00:03:22.918 --> 00:03:26.038
The bubbles burst, and the market crashed.

00:03:26.038 --> 00:03:31.278
Today, scholars work long and hard
trying to predict what causes a bubble

00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:33.323
and how to avoid them.

00:03:33.323 --> 00:03:35.736
Tulip mania is an effective illustration

00:03:35.736 --> 00:03:39.414
of the underlying principles 
at work in a bubble

00:03:39.414 --> 00:03:42.285
and can help us understand 
more recent examples

00:03:42.285 --> 00:03:46.100
like the real estate bubble 
of the late 2000s.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.388
The economy will continue 
to go through phases

00:03:48.388 --> 00:03:50.595
of booms and busts.

00:03:50.595 --> 00:03:52.952
So while we wait 
for the next mania to start,

00:03:52.952 --> 00:03:54.932
and the next bubble to burst,

00:03:54.932 --> 00:03:57.220
treat yourself to a bouquet of tulips

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.256
and enjoy the fact that you didn't have 
to pay an arm and a leg for them.
