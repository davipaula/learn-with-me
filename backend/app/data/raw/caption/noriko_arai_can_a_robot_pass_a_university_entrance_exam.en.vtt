00:00:13.014 --> 00:00:16.674
Today, I'm going to talk about AI and us.

00:00:18.206 --> 00:00:20.349
AI researchers have always said

00:00:20.373 --> 00:00:22.967
that we humans do not need to worry,

00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:26.571
because only menial jobs
will be taken over by machines.

00:00:27.274 --> 00:00:28.877
Is that really true?

00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:34.192
They have also said
that AI will create new jobs,

00:00:34.216 --> 00:00:37.627
so those who lose their jobs
will find a new one.

00:00:38.264 --> 00:00:39.619
Of course.

00:00:39.643 --> 00:00:41.815
But the real question is:

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:45.944
How many of those
who may lose their jobs to AI

00:00:45.968 --> 00:00:48.457
will be able to land a new one,

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:54.331
especially when AI is smart enough
to learn better than most of us?

00:00:55.397 --> 00:00:57.582
Let me ask you a question:

00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:00.464
How many of you think

00:01:00.488 --> 00:01:06.582
that AI will pass the entrance examination
of a top university by 2020?

00:01:07.836 --> 00:01:10.293
Oh, so many. OK.

00:01:10.317 --> 00:01:14.675
So some of you may say, "Of course, yes!"

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.503
Now singularity is the issue.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.685
And some others may say, "Maybe,

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:26.217
because AI already won
against a top Go player."

00:01:27.213 --> 00:01:30.894
And others may say, "No, never. Uh-uh."

00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:35.788
That means we do not know
the answer yet, right?

00:01:36.268 --> 00:01:41.228
So that was the reason why
I started Todai Robot Project,

00:01:41.252 --> 00:01:45.124
making an AI which passes
the entrance examination

00:01:45.148 --> 00:01:47.737
of the University of Tokyo,

00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:50.298
the top university in Japan.

00:01:51.464 --> 00:01:54.012
This is our Todai Robot.

00:01:56.131 --> 00:02:01.941
And, of course, the brain of the robot
is working in the remote server.

00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:06.969
It is now writing a 600-word essay

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:11.112
on maritime trade in the 17th century.

00:02:11.136 --> 00:02:12.901
How does that sound?

00:02:14.113 --> 00:02:18.217
Why did I take the entrance exam
as its benchmark?

00:02:19.098 --> 00:02:23.839
Because I thought we had to study
the performance of AI

00:02:23.863 --> 00:02:25.977
in comparison to humans,

00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:28.861
especially on the skills and expertise

00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:32.973
which are believed
to be acquired only by humans

00:02:32.997 --> 00:02:35.332
and only through education.

00:02:35.782 --> 00:02:39.825
To enter Todai, the University of Tokyo,

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:44.270
you have to pass
two different types of exams.

00:02:44.294 --> 00:02:48.054
The first one is
a national standardized test

00:02:48.078 --> 00:02:50.481
in multiple-choice style.

00:02:50.505 --> 00:02:52.960
You have to take seven subjects

00:02:52.984 --> 00:02:54.939
and achieve a high score --

00:02:54.963 --> 00:02:59.735
I would say like an 85 percent
or more accuracy rate --

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.846
to be allowed to take
the second stage written test

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.029
prepared by Todai.

00:03:06.994 --> 00:03:12.311
So let me first explain
how modern AI works,

00:03:12.335 --> 00:03:15.404
taking the "Jeopardy!" challenge
as an example.

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:20.618
Here is a typical "Jeopardy!" question:

00:03:20.642 --> 00:03:25.103
"Mozart's last symphony
shares its name with this planet."

00:03:26.195 --> 00:03:30.208
Interestingly, a "Jeopardy!"
question always asks,

00:03:30.232 --> 00:03:33.560
always ends with "this" something:

00:03:33.584 --> 00:03:36.411
"this" planet, "this" country,

00:03:36.435 --> 00:03:39.043
"this" rock musician, and so on.

00:03:39.067 --> 00:03:43.366
In other words, "Jeopardy!" doesn't ask
many different types of questions,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.227
but a single type,

00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:47.787
which we call "factoid questions."

00:03:48.975 --> 00:03:51.142
By the way, do you know the answer?

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.035
If you do not know the answer
and if you want to know the answer,

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:59.346
what would you do?

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.292
You Google, right? Of course.

00:04:03.316 --> 00:04:04.796
Why not?

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.412
But you have to pick appropriate keywords

00:04:08.436 --> 00:04:12.800
like "Mozart," "last"
and "symphony" to search.

00:04:13.462 --> 00:04:15.862
The machine basically does the same.

00:04:16.457 --> 00:04:21.117
Then this Wikipedia page
will be ranked top.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.748
Then the machine reads the page.

00:04:23.772 --> 00:04:24.943
No, uh-uh.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.932
Unfortunately, none of the modern AIs,

00:04:28.956 --> 00:04:32.924
including Watson, Siri and Todai Robot,

00:04:32.948 --> 00:04:34.609
is able to read.

00:04:35.437 --> 00:04:39.237
But they are very good
at searching and optimizing.

00:04:40.158 --> 00:04:42.181
It will recognize

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:45.801
that the keywords "Mozart,"
"last" and "symphony"

00:04:45.825 --> 00:04:48.728
are appearing heavily around here.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.165
So if it can find a word which is a planet

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:57.837
and which is co-occurring
with these keywords,

00:04:57.861 --> 00:04:59.850
that must be the answer.

00:05:00.762 --> 00:05:05.948
This is how Watson finds
the answer "Jupiter," in this case.

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:12.482
Our Todai Robot works similarly,
but a bit smarter

00:05:12.506 --> 00:05:15.745
in answering history yes-no questions,

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.223
like, "'Charlemagne repelled the Magyars.'
Is this sentence true or false?"

00:05:23.181 --> 00:05:27.254
Our robot starts producing
a factoid question,

00:05:27.278 --> 00:05:32.177
like: "Charlemagne repelled
[this person type]" by itself.

00:05:32.995 --> 00:05:37.727
Then, "Avars" but not
"Magyars" is ranked top.

00:05:38.357 --> 00:05:41.406
This sentence is likely to be false.

00:05:42.772 --> 00:05:47.632
Our robot does not read,
does not understand,

00:05:48.335 --> 00:05:52.479
but it is statistically
correct in many cases.

00:05:54.147 --> 00:05:56.655
For the second stage written test,

00:05:56.679 --> 00:06:01.785
it is required to write
a 600-word essay like this one:

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:04.087
[Discuss the rise and fall
of the maritime trade

00:06:04.111 --> 00:06:06.533
in East and Southeast Asia
in the 17th century ...]

00:06:06.557 --> 00:06:07.944
and as I have shown earlier,

00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:12.162
our robot took the sentences
from the textbooks and Wikipedia,

00:06:12.186 --> 00:06:14.147
combined them together,

00:06:14.171 --> 00:06:17.790
and optimized it to produce an essay

00:06:17.814 --> 00:06:20.021
without understanding a thing.

00:06:20.045 --> 00:06:21.782
(Laughter)

00:06:21.806 --> 00:06:26.701
But surprisingly, it wrote a better essay

00:06:26.725 --> 00:06:28.286
than most of the students.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.701
(Laughter)

00:06:30.725 --> 00:06:32.254
How about mathematics?

00:06:33.354 --> 00:06:36.512
A fully automatic math-solving machine

00:06:36.536 --> 00:06:38.167
has been a dream

00:06:38.191 --> 00:06:42.870
since the birth of the word
"artificial intelligence,"

00:06:43.785 --> 00:06:49.792
but it has stayed at the level
of arithmetic for a long, long time.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:56.880
Last year, we finally succeeded
in developing a system

00:06:56.904 --> 00:07:02.077
which solved pre-university-level
problems from end to end,

00:07:02.101 --> 00:07:03.363
like this one.

00:07:05.648 --> 00:07:09.650
This is the original problem
written in Japanese,

00:07:09.674 --> 00:07:14.071
and we had to teach it
2,000 mathematical axioms

00:07:14.095 --> 00:07:16.869
and 8,000 Japanese words

00:07:16.893 --> 00:07:21.451
to make it accept the problems
written in natural language.

00:07:22.234 --> 00:07:25.776
And it is now translating
the original problems

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.939
into machine-readable formulas.

00:07:30.578 --> 00:07:36.677
Weird, but it is now ready
to solve it, I think.

00:07:36.701 --> 00:07:38.112
Go and solve it.

00:07:38.818 --> 00:07:43.102
Yes! It is now executing
symbolic computation.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.610
Even more weird,

00:07:45.634 --> 00:07:50.459
but probably this is the most
fun part for the machine.

00:07:50.483 --> 00:07:52.834
(Laughter)

00:07:52.858 --> 00:07:55.673
Now it outputs a perfect answer,

00:07:55.697 --> 00:08:00.404
though its proof is impossible to read,
even for mathematicians.

00:08:02.773 --> 00:08:09.734
Anyway, last year our robot
was among the top one percent

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:13.832
in the second stage written
exam in mathematics.

00:08:14.652 --> 00:08:17.862
(Applause)

00:08:18.412 --> 00:08:19.723
Thank you.

00:08:19.747 --> 00:08:22.218
So, did it enter Todai?

00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:26.039
No, not as I expected.

00:08:26.783 --> 00:08:28.182
Why?

00:08:28.206 --> 00:08:30.845
Because it doesn't understand any meaning.

00:08:32.308 --> 00:08:36.387
Let me show you a typical error
it made in the English test.

00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:39.388
[Nate: We're almost at the bookstore.
Just a few more minutes.

00:08:39.412 --> 00:08:42.451
Sunil: Wait. ______ .
Nate: Thank you! That always happens ...]

00:08:42.475 --> 00:08:43.626
Two people are talking.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:45.704
For us, who can understand
the situation --

00:08:45.704 --> 00:08:48.477
[1. "We walked for a long time."
2. "We're almost there."

00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:51.533
3. "Your shoes look expensive."
4. "Your shoelace is untied."]

00:08:51.557 --> 00:08:54.430
it is obvious number four
is the correct answer, right?

00:08:54.454 --> 00:08:56.692
But Todai Robot chose number two,

00:08:56.716 --> 00:09:02.076
even after learning 15 billion
English sentences

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.828
using deep learning technologies.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.772
OK, so now you might
understand what I said:

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:15.047
modern AIs do not read,

00:09:15.071 --> 00:09:16.484
do not understand.

00:09:17.516 --> 00:09:20.685
They only disguise as if they do.

00:09:24.867 --> 00:09:27.848
This is the distribution graph

00:09:27.872 --> 00:09:33.649
of half a million students
who took the same exam as Todai Robot.

00:09:34.558 --> 00:09:39.723
Now our Todai Robot
is among the top 20 percent,

00:09:40.986 --> 00:09:43.401
and it was capable to pass

00:09:43.425 --> 00:09:47.366
more than 60 percent
of the universities in Japan --

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.767
but not Todai.

00:09:50.116 --> 00:09:54.141
But see how it is beyond the volume zone

00:09:54.165 --> 00:09:57.029
of to-be white-collar workers.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.918
You might think I was delighted.

00:10:03.939 --> 00:10:07.910
After all, my robot was surpassing
students everywhere.

00:10:09.022 --> 00:10:11.713
Instead, I was alarmed.

00:10:13.086 --> 00:10:18.693
How on earth could this unintelligent
machine outperform students --

00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:20.009
our children?

00:10:20.033 --> 00:10:21.186
Right?

00:10:22.101 --> 00:10:26.503
I decided to investigate
what was going on in the human world.

00:10:28.542 --> 00:10:33.271
I took hundreds of sentences
from high school textbooks

00:10:33.859 --> 00:10:37.172
and made easy multiple-choice quizzes,

00:10:37.196 --> 00:10:41.339
and asked thousands
of high school students to answer.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:43.866
Here is an example:

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.708
[Buddhism spread to ... ,
Christianity to ... and Oceania,

00:10:46.732 --> 00:10:47.883
and Islam to ...]

00:10:47.907 --> 00:10:50.647
Of course, the original problems
are written in Japanese,

00:10:50.671 --> 00:10:51.826
their mother tongue.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.365
[ ______ has spread to Oceania.

00:10:53.389 --> 00:10:55.806
1. Hinduism 2. Christianity
3. Islam 4. Buddhism ]

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.129
Obviously, Christianity
is the answer, isn't it?

00:10:58.153 --> 00:10:59.367
It's written!

00:11:01.482 --> 00:11:05.508
And Todai Robot chose
the correct answer, too.

00:11:06.758 --> 00:11:11.637
But one-third of junior
high school students

00:11:11.661 --> 00:11:14.273
failed to answer this question.

00:11:16.456 --> 00:11:19.615
Do you think it is only the case in Japan?

00:11:19.639 --> 00:11:21.615
I do not think so,

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:28.010
because Japan is always ranked
among the top in OECD PISA tests,

00:11:28.034 --> 00:11:31.961
measuring 15-year-old
students' performance in mathematics,

00:11:31.985 --> 00:11:33.949
science and reading

00:11:33.973 --> 00:11:35.609
every three years.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.443
We have been believing

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:43.510
that everybody can learn

00:11:43.534 --> 00:11:45.439
and learn well,

00:11:45.463 --> 00:11:49.160
as long as we provide
good learning materials

00:11:49.184 --> 00:11:50.639
free on the web

00:11:50.663 --> 00:11:53.732
so that they can access
through the internet.

00:11:53.756 --> 00:11:59.615
But such wonderful materials
may benefit only those who can read well,

00:12:00.534 --> 00:12:04.469
and the percentage
of those who can read well

00:12:04.493 --> 00:12:07.871
may be much less than we expected.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.281
How we humans will coexist with AI

00:12:14.305 --> 00:12:17.827
is something we have
to think about carefully,

00:12:17.851 --> 00:12:19.988
based on solid evidence.

00:12:21.063 --> 00:12:25.040
At the same time,
we have to think in a hurry

00:12:25.064 --> 00:12:27.466
because time is running out.

00:12:28.106 --> 00:12:29.268
Thank you.

00:12:29.626 --> 00:12:33.559
(Applause)

00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:36.291
Chris Anderson: Noriko, thank you.

00:12:36.315 --> 00:12:38.080
Noriko Arai: Thank you.

00:12:38.104 --> 00:12:43.408
CA: In your talk, you so beautifully
give us a sense of how AIs think,

00:12:43.432 --> 00:12:44.996
what they can do amazingly

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.715
and what they can't do.

00:12:46.739 --> 00:12:48.233
But -- do I read you right,

00:12:48.257 --> 00:12:53.527
that you think we really need
quite an urgent revolution in education

00:12:53.551 --> 00:12:57.706
to help kids do the things
that humans can do better than AIs?

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.058
NA: Yes, yes, yes.

00:12:59.082 --> 00:13:03.117
Because we humans
can understand the meaning.

00:13:03.141 --> 00:13:08.047
That is something
which is very, very lacking in AI.

00:13:08.071 --> 00:13:12.439
But most of the students
just pack the knowledge

00:13:12.463 --> 00:13:16.366
without understanding
the meaning of the knowledge,

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.199
so that is not knowledge,
that is just memorizing,

00:13:19.223 --> 00:13:21.673
and AI can do the same thing.

00:13:21.697 --> 00:13:25.328
So we have to think about
a new type of education.

00:13:25.352 --> 00:13:28.641
CA: A shift from knowledge,
rote knowledge, to meaning.

00:13:28.665 --> 00:13:29.816
NA: Mm-hmm.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.080
CA: Well, there's a challenge
for the educators. Thank you so much.

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:34.802
NA: Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:13:34.826 --> 00:13:36.011
(Applause)
