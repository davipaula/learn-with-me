00:00:13.484 --> 00:00:15.416
Where does the end begin?

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.680
Well, for me, it all began
with this little fellow.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.656
This adorable organism --

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.136
well, I think it's adorable --

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.176
is called Tetrahymena
and it's a single-celled creature.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.096
It's also been known as pond scum.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.840
So that's right, my career
started with pond scum.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.736
Now, it was no surprise
I became a scientist.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.856
Growing up far away from here,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.776
as a little girl I was deadly curious

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.776
about everything alive.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.440
I used to pick up lethally poisonous
stinging jellyfish and sing to them.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.616
And so starting my career,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.016
I was deadly curious
about fundamental mysteries

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.376
of the most basic building blocks of life,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.096
and I was fortunate to live in a society
where that curiosity was valued.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.696
Now, for me, this little
pond scum critter Tetrahymena

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.016
was a great way to study
the fundamental mystery

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.096
I was most curious about:

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.495
those bundles of DNA
in our cells called chromosomes.

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:22.936
And it was because I was curious
about the very ends of chromosomes,

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.976
known as telomeres.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.696
Now, when I started my quest,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.616
all we knew was that they helped
protect the ends of chromosomes.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.336
It was important when cells divide.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.736
It was really important,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.856
but I wanted to find out
what telomeres consisted of,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.656
and for that, I needed a lot of them.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.256
And it so happens
that cute little Tetrahymena

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.296
has a lot of short linear chromosomes,

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.936
around 20,000,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.320
so lots of telomeres.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.896
And I discovered that telomeres
consisted of special segments

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.616
of noncoding DNA right
at the very ends of chromosomes.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.816
But here's a problem.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.656
Now, we all start life as a single cell.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.416
It multiples to two.
Two becomes four. Four becomes eight,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.656
and on and on to form
the 200 million billion cells

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.320
that make up our adult body.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.840
And some of those cells
have to divide thousands of times.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.496
In fact, even as I stand here before you,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.616
all throughout my body,
cells are furiously replenishing

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.160
to, well, keep me
standing here before you.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.496
So every time a cell divides,
all of its DNA has to be copied,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.136
all of the coding DNA
inside of those chromosomes,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.696
because that carries
the vital operating instructions

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.736
that keep our cells in good working order,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.416
so my heart cells can keep a steady beat,

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.656
which I assure you
they're not doing right now,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.576
and my immune cells

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.496
can fight off bacteria and viruses,

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.376
and our brain cells
can save the memory of our first kiss

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.880
and keep on learning throughout life.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.336
But there is a glitch
in the way DNA is copied.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.216
It is just one of those facts of life.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.616
Every time the cell divides
and the DNA is copied,

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.656
some of that DNA from the ends
gets worn down and shortened,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.976
some of that telomere DNA.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.176
And think about it

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.656
like the protective caps
at the ends of your shoelace.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.216
And those keep the shoelace,
or the chromosome, from fraying,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.576
and when that tip
gets too short, it falls off,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.280
and that worn down telomere
sends a signal to the cells.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.536
"The DNA is no longer being protected."

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.576
It sends a signal. Time to die.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.056
So, end of story.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.960
Well, sorry, not so fast.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.736
It can't be the end of the story,

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.256
because life hasn't died
off the face of the earth.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.896
So I was curious:

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.016
if such wear and tear is inevitable,

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.256
how on earth does Mother Nature make sure

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.720
we can keep our chromosomes intact?

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.240
Now, remember that little
pond scum critter Tetrahymena?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.640
The craziest thing was,
Tetrahymena cells never got old and died.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.400
Their telomeres weren't shortening
as time marched on.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.096
Sometimes they even got longer.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.016
Something else was at work,

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.000
and believe me, that something
was not in any textbook.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.936
So working in my lab with
my extraordinary student Carol Greider --

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.560
and Carol and I shared
the Nobel Prize for this work --

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.360
we began running experiments

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.200
and we discovered
cells do have something else.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.936
It was a previously undreamed-of enzyme

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.496
that could replenish,
make longer, telomeres,

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.320
and we named it telomerase.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.456
And when we removed
our pond scum's telomerase,

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.920
their telomeres ran down and they died.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.296
So it was thanks
to their plentiful telomerase

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.800
that our pond scum critters never got old.

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.320
OK, now, that's
an incredibly hopeful message

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.400
for us humans to be
receiving from pond scum,

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.656
because it turns out

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.496
that as we humans age,
our telomeres do shorten,

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.536
and remarkably,
that shortening is aging us.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.736
Generally speaking,
the longer your telomeres,

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.000
the better off you are.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.376
It's the overshortening of telomeres

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.800
that leads us to feel and see
signs of aging.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.296
My skin cells start to die

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.176
and I start to see fine lines, wrinkles.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.040
Hair pigment cells die.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.000
You start to see gray.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.360
Immune system cells die.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.856
You increase your risks of getting sick.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.496
In fact, the cumulative research
from the last 20 years

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.696
has made clear that telomere attrition

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.256
is contributing to our risks
of getting cardiovascular diseases,

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.096
Alzheimer's, some cancers and diabetes,

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.840
the very conditions many of us die of.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.000
And so we have to think about this.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.296
What is going on?

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.056
This attrition,

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.056
we look and we feel older, yeah.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.616
Our telomeres are losing
the war of attrition faster.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.096
And those of us who feel youthful longer,

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.776
it turns out our telomeres
are staying longer

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.096
for longer periods of time,

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.896
extending our feelings of youthfulness

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.416
and reducing the risks
of all we most dread

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.480
as the birthdays go by.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.696
OK,

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.880
seems like a no-brainer.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.296
Now, if my telomeres are connected

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.896
to how quickly
I'm going to feel and get old,

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.376
if my telomeres can be
renewed by my telomerase,

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.896
then all I have to do to reverse
the signs and symptoms of aging

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.456
is figure out where to buy
that Costco-sized bottle

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.656
of grade A organic
fair trade telomerase, right?

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.336
Great! Problem solved.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.376
(Applause)

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.296
Not so fast, I'm sorry.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.776
Alas, that's not the case.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.056
OK. And why?

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.416
It's because human genetics has taught us

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.536
that when it comes to our telomerase,

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.976
we humans live on a knife edge.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.240
OK, simply put,

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:42.536
yes, nudging up telomerase
does decrease the risks of some diseases,

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:48.616
but it also increases the risks
of certain and rather nasty cancers.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:54.416
So even if you could buy
that Costco-sized bottle of telomerase,

00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:01.176
and there are many websites
marketing such dubious products,

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:05.760
the problem is you could
nudge up your risks of cancers.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.840
And we don't want that.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.136
Now, don't worry,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.056
and because, while I think
it's kind of funny that right now,

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.740
you know, many of us may be thinking,
"Well, I'd rather be like pond scum," ...

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.840
(Laughter)

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.216
there is something for us humans

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.816
in the story of telomeres
and their maintenance.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.496
But I want to get one thing clear.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.696
It isn't about enormously
extending human lifespan

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.736
or immortality.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.656
It's about health span.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.376
Now, health span is the number
of years of your life

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.176
when you're free of disease,
you're healthy, you're productive,

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.336
you're zestfully enjoying life.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.056
Disease span, the opposite of health span,

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.816
is the time of your life
spent feeling old and sick and dying.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.416
So the real question becomes,

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.200
OK, if I can't guzzle telomerase,

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.096
do I have control
over my telomeres' length

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.856
and hence my well-being, my health,

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.480
without those downsides of cancer risks?

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.816
OK?

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.576
So, it's the year 2000.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.816
Now, I've been minutely scrutinizing
little teeny tiny telomeres

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.256
very happily for many years,

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.096
when into my lab walks
a psychologist named Elissa Epel.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:35.816
Now, Elissa's expertise is in the effects
of severe, chronic psychological stress

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.760
on our mind's and our body's health.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.216
And there she was standing in my lab,

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.296
which ironically overlooked
the entrance to a mortuary, and --

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.656
(Laughter)

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.336
And she had a life-and-death
question for me.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.016
"What happens to telomeres
in people who are chronically stressed?"

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.256
she asked me.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.416
You see, she'd been studying caregivers,

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:03.976
and specifically mothers of children
with a chronic condition,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.536
be it gut disorder,
be it autism, you name it --

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:13.760
a group obviously under enormous
and prolonged psychological stress.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.056
I have to say, her question

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.096
changed me profoundly.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.856
See, all this time
I had been thinking of telomeres

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.176
as those miniscule
molecular structures that they are,

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.520
and the genes that control telomeres.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.936
And when Elissa asked me
about studying caregivers,

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.440
I suddenly saw telomeres
in a whole new light.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.296
I saw beyond the genes and the chromosomes

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:46.256
into the lives of the real people
we were studying.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.496
And I'm a mom myself,

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.456
and at that moment,

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.296
I was struck by the image of these women

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.440
dealing with a child with a condition

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.200
very difficult to deal with,
often without help.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.096
And such women, simply,

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.910
often look worn down.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.696
So was it possible their telomeres
were worn down as well?

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.376
So our collective curiosity
went into overdrive.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:21.296
Elissa selected for our first study
a group of such caregiving mothers,

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.496
and we wanted to ask:
What's the length of their telomeres

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.096
compared with the number of years
that they have been caregiving

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.896
for their child with a chronic condition?

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.696
So four years go by

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.856
and the day comes
when all the results are in,

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.576
and Elissa looked down
at our first scatterplot

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.120
and literally gasped,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.576
because there was a pattern to the data,

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:53.016
and it was the exact gradient
that we most feared might exist.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.976
It was right there on the page.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.416
The longer, the more years that is,

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.336
the mother had been
in this caregiving situation,

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.056
no matter her age,

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.056
the shorter were her telomeres.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.176
And the more she perceived

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.856
her situation as being more stressful,

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:17.240
the lower was her telomerase
and the shorter were her telomeres.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.856
So we had discovered something unheard of:

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.736
the more chronic stress you are under,
the shorter your telomeres,

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:32.416
meaning the more likely you were
to fall victim to an early disease span

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.160
and perhaps untimely death.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.336
Our findings meant
that people's life events

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.296
and the way we respond to these events

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:46.400
can change how you
maintain your telomeres.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.800
So telomere length wasn't
just a matter of age counted in years.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.936
Elissa's question to me,

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.880
back when she first came to my lab,
indeed had been a life-and-death question.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.056
Now, luckily, hidden
in that data there was hope.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.696
We noticed that some mothers,

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.856
despite having been carefully caring
for their children for many years,

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.480
had been able to maintain their telomeres.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:20.936
So studying these women closely revealed
that they were resilient to stress.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.616
Somehow they were able
to experience their circumstances

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.136
not as a threat day in and day out

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.816
but as a challenge,

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.896
and this has led to a very important
insight for all of us:

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.696
we have control over the way we age

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.240
all the way down into our cells.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:43.096
OK, now our initial curiosity
became infectious.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.696
Thousands of scientists
from different fields

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.216
added their expertise
to telomere research,

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.160
and the findings have poured in.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:56.840
It's up to over 10,000
scientific papers and counting.

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.336
So several studies
rapidly confirmed our initial finding

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.120
that yes, chronic stress
is bad for telomeres.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.096
And now many are revealing

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.016
that we have more control
over this particular aging process

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.856
than any of us could ever have imagined.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.096
A few examples:

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.256
a study from the University
of California, Los Angeles

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:25.696
of people who are caring
for a relative with dementia, long-term,

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:31.176
and looked at their caregiver's
telomere maintenance capacity

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.416
and found that it was improved

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:37.256
by them practicing a form of meditation

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.160
for as little as 12 minutes
a day for two months.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.376
Attitude matters.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.776
If you're habitually a negative thinker,

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:51.536
you typically see a stressful situation
with a threat stress response,

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.016
meaning if your boss wants to see you,

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.376
you automatically think,
"I'm about to be fired,"

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.976
and your blood vessels constrict,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.336
and your level of the stress
hormone cortisol creeps up,

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.896
and then it stays up,

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.856
and over time, that persistently
high level of the cortisol

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.776
actually damps down your telomerase.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.560
Not good for your telomeres.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.456
On the other hand,

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:21.456
if you typically see something stressful
as a challenge to be tackled,

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.936
then blood flows to your heart
and to your brain,

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:29.656
and you experience a brief
but energizing spike of cortisol.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.216
And thanks to that habitual
"bring it on" attitude,

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:35.280
your telomeres do just fine.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.800
So ...

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.000
What is all of this telling us?

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.416
Your telomeres do just fine.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:53.416
You really do have power
to change what is happening

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.800
to your own telomeres.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:01.520
But our curiosity
just got more and more intense,

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.936
because we started to wonder,

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.176
what about factors outside our own skin?

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.120
Could they impact
our telomere maintenance as well?

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.136
You know, we humans
are intensely social beings.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.160
Was it even possible
that our telomeres were social as well?

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.160
And the results have been startling.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.080
As early as childhood,

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.536
emotional neglect, exposure to violence,

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.576
bullying and racism

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:38.040
all impact your telomeres,
and the effects are long-term.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.096
Can you imagine the impact on children

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.040
of living years in a war zone?

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.096
People who can't trust their neighbors

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.256
and who don't feel safe
in their neighborhoods

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.360
consistently have shorter telomeres.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.576
So your home address
matters for telomeres as well.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.800
On the flip side,

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.496
tight-knit communities,
being in a marriage long-term,

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.456
and lifelong friendships, even,

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.400
all improve telomere maintenance.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:13.816
So what is all this telling us?

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:18.336
It's telling us that I have the power
to impact my own telomeres,

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:21.656
and I also have the power to impact yours.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:27.480
Telomere science has told us
just how interconnected we all are.

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.720
But I'm still curious.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.160
I do wonder

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.400
what legacy all of us

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.319
will leave for the next generation?

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.536
Will we invest

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:45.576
in the next young woman or man

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.816
peering through a microscope
at the next little critter,

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.496
the next bit of pond scum,

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:56.296
curious about a question
we don't even know today is a question?

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.216
It could be a great question
that could impact all the world.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:02.920
And maybe, maybe you're curious about you.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.336
Now that you know
how to protect your telomeres,

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.265
are you curious what are you going to do

00:18:08.289 --> 00:18:10.769
with all those decades
of brimming good health?

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.080
And now that you know you could impact
the telomeres of others,

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.240
are you curious

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.000
how will you make a difference?

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.976
And now that you know the power
of curiosity to change the world,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:32.216
how will you make sure
that the world invests in curiosity

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.800
for the sake of the generations
that will come after us?

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:39.776
Thank you.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:45.200
(Applause)
