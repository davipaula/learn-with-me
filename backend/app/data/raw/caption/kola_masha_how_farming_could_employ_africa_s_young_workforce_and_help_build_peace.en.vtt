00:00:12.904 --> 00:00:17.786
Since 1997, researchers
at the University of Sussex

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.010
have monitored global trends
in armed conflict.

00:00:21.863 --> 00:00:25.043
Their research clearly shows

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:28.871
that in Africa, over the last 10 years,

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:32.576
armed conflict has gone up by sevenfold.

00:00:32.927 --> 00:00:34.460
Let's think about that:

00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:38.690
sevenfold in a single decade.

00:00:40.622 --> 00:00:41.772
Why is this?

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.162
We believe, as oxygen is to fire,

00:00:46.186 --> 00:00:49.495
so are unemployed youth to insecurity.

00:00:50.546 --> 00:00:54.305
We have a lot of youth on this continent.

00:00:54.791 --> 00:00:56.734
Youth like Sandra,

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.839
who, on a Saturday morning in March 2014,

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:07.120
woke up excited at the prospects
of getting a coveted job

00:01:07.144 --> 00:01:09.716
at the Nigerian Immigration Services.

00:01:10.263 --> 00:01:13.082
She kissed her daughter goodbye,

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:14.382
left her home,

00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:16.238
never to return.

00:01:16.632 --> 00:01:22.877
Sandra and 15 other young Nigerians
died that day, applying for a job,

00:01:24.942 --> 00:01:26.723
in the ensuing stampede,

00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:33.887
as tens of thousands of people applied
for a few thousand open positions.

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:44.899
In the last 20 years, 20 million youth
have entered the Nigerian workforce alone.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:51.724
Today, half our population
is under the age of 18.

00:01:52.164 --> 00:01:55.410
That's almost 80 million people

00:01:55.434 --> 00:01:59.301
that will be entering the workforce
in the next 20 years.

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:03.398
My friends,

00:02:03.422 --> 00:02:08.413
if a wave of 20 million people
entering the workforce

00:02:08.437 --> 00:02:10.916
triggered Niger Delta crisis,

00:02:11.768 --> 00:02:14.037
Fulani herdsmen crisis

00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:15.808
and Boko Haram,

00:02:16.768 --> 00:02:18.169
I ask you:

00:02:18.193 --> 00:02:21.453
What will four times that number do?

00:02:23.614 --> 00:02:26.955
To do my part to solve this challenge,

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:31.301
in 2012, I moved to a small village
in northern Nigeria,

00:02:32.507 --> 00:02:36.994
in the center of the area
most recently hit

00:02:37.018 --> 00:02:43.696
by the spread of insecurity,
brutal bombings and searing poverty,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.290
with an idea:

00:02:46.522 --> 00:02:53.196
Could we create an economic buffer
to halt the spread of this insecurity,

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.185
by unlocking the power of agriculture
as a job-creation engine?

00:02:58.085 --> 00:03:02.069
We knew this had been done before
in countries like Thailand,

00:03:02.093 --> 00:03:06.400
where, in 1980, they suffered from
the same economic challenges as us.

00:03:07.577 --> 00:03:12.981
Today, however, Thailand produces
two million cars a year --

00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:15.513
more than the United Kingdom --

00:03:15.537 --> 00:03:18.403
with over 30 percent of its workforce

00:03:18.427 --> 00:03:21.958
as highly commercial,
profitable small farmers,

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:28.093
with an unemployment rate
of less than one percent.

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:31.193
How did they do this?

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.323
In the 80s, Thailand dramatically improved
the productivity of its small farmers,

00:03:39.543 --> 00:03:44.141
ensuring that it was able
to start to dominate

00:03:44.165 --> 00:03:46.157
export markets for produce.

00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:49.855
Building on this strength,
they attracted investment

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.220
and started to process,

00:03:52.244 --> 00:03:56.026
being able to export higher-value products
like starch from cassava.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.315
Finally, coupled
with investment in education,

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:04.497
they started to expand
to even higher-value manufacturing.

00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:12.283
To make our idea a reality
and follow a path similar to Thailand,

00:04:12.307 --> 00:04:18.007
we knew that we would have to sell
young farmers on farming.

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:22.954
A young man in northern Nigeria,

00:04:22.978 --> 00:04:27.442
for the purpose of today's
discussion, we'll call "Saminu,"

00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:30.442
made it very clear to me
that this would not be easy.

00:04:31.363 --> 00:04:35.096
Saminu grew up in a beautiful village
in northern Nigeria.

00:04:35.571 --> 00:04:39.627
And he tells wondrous stories
of playing for hours with his friends,

00:04:39.651 --> 00:04:42.120
running up and down
the beautiful rock formations

00:04:42.144 --> 00:04:44.877
that dot the countryside around his home.

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:48.395
Despite this beauty, Saminu knew

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.140
that the first chance he got,
he would leave.

00:04:52.315 --> 00:04:54.283
He did not want to be a farmer.

00:04:55.431 --> 00:05:00.836
Growing up, he saw his parents
work so hard as farmers,

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.843
but barely get by.

00:05:03.934 --> 00:05:08.339
As he says, they had "babu" -- nothing.

00:05:11.266 --> 00:05:15.885
Young farmers like Saminu

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:18.607
do not have access to the cash

00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:22.058
to buy the farming products
to pair with their hard work

00:05:22.082 --> 00:05:23.882
to be successful.

00:05:26.462 --> 00:05:28.287
When their meager harvest came in,

00:05:28.311 --> 00:05:33.570
desperate for cash, they would sell
most of it at fire-sale prices,

00:05:33.594 --> 00:05:37.724
when, if they could just wait six months,
they could get 50 percent more.

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:42.795
Hence, Saminu left to the city,

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.314
where he soon realized
that life was not easy.

00:05:48.236 --> 00:05:51.302
He borrowed a very old motorcycle,

00:05:52.276 --> 00:05:55.815
with tires that were
more patches than tires,

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:58.290
to become a motorcycle taxi driver.

00:05:59.553 --> 00:06:03.045
He lived in constant fear every day

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:07.887
that his precious, tattered motorcycle
would be ripped away from him,

00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:09.763
as it had before.

00:06:11.934 --> 00:06:14.806
But he got it back, thankfully.

00:06:16.315 --> 00:06:18.997
He knew of others, however,
who were not so lucky --

00:06:19.617 --> 00:06:22.323
other young men who,
once they'd lost their motorcycles,

00:06:22.347 --> 00:06:23.704
became destitute.

00:06:25.268 --> 00:06:28.165
Angry, these young men set
out to wreak vengeance

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:32.180
on a society that they believed
had turned its back on them.

00:06:34.617 --> 00:06:40.529
Saminu told me that
they joined insurgent groups,

00:06:40.553 --> 00:06:45.537
often acting as getaway drivers
in bombings and kidnappings.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.766
To end this cycle of insecurity,

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.854
we must make farming a viable choice.

00:06:53.878 --> 00:06:57.760
We must ensure that these young men,
on their small farms,

00:06:57.784 --> 00:07:01.577
can earn enough money
to make a life for themselves;

00:07:01.601 --> 00:07:02.751
to make a future.

00:07:03.323 --> 00:07:05.561
The question now is how.

00:07:06.315 --> 00:07:10.180
Recognizing that Africa
has grassroot-level leadership,

00:07:10.204 --> 00:07:12.847
we simply developed a model

00:07:12.871 --> 00:07:16.307
to bring the professional management
and investment to scale

00:07:16.331 --> 00:07:19.104
to these grassroot leaders.

00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:25.153
We called it "Babban Gona" --
"great farm" in Hausa.

00:07:26.948 --> 00:07:31.519
Upon reaching the village in 2012,

00:07:31.543 --> 00:07:33.805
I traveled from community to community,

00:07:33.829 --> 00:07:37.686
trying to convince people of our idea,

00:07:38.152 --> 00:07:42.535
trying to recruit farmer members.

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:46.115
We failed woefully that first year,

00:07:46.895 --> 00:07:49.775
barely recruiting 100 brave souls.

00:07:51.053 --> 00:07:52.253
But we persevered.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.196
We kept doing what we promised,

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.874
slowly we gained their trust.

00:08:02.038 --> 00:08:03.571
More farmers joined us.

00:08:04.315 --> 00:08:06.353
Fast-forward now five years.

00:08:06.377 --> 00:08:08.739
With a passionate and committed team

00:08:10.165 --> 00:08:13.259
and the tremendous support
of our partners,

00:08:14.695 --> 00:08:16.095
we grew dramatically,

00:08:17.509 --> 00:08:21.457
today, serving 20,000 small farmers,

00:08:21.481 --> 00:08:28.396
enabling them to double their yields
and triple their net income

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.902
relative to their peers.

00:08:31.552 --> 00:08:33.649
We are very proud of the fact --

00:08:33.673 --> 00:08:38.696
(Applause)

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.918
Fast-forward three years,

00:08:40.942 --> 00:08:42.506
Saminu has earned enough money

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:47.227
to buy three goats for his mother
to start a goat-rearing business,

00:08:47.251 --> 00:08:50.164
owns his own retail store

00:08:50.188 --> 00:08:55.474
and bought not one, but two motorcycles,

00:08:55.498 --> 00:08:58.966
with vanity license plates: "Babban Gona."

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:04.037
(Applause)

00:09:04.956 --> 00:09:06.126
My friends,

00:09:07.322 --> 00:09:08.840
in the next 20 years,

00:09:09.702 --> 00:09:14.003
over 400 million Saminus
are entering the African workforce,

00:09:14.855 --> 00:09:18.988
with potentially half of them
having opportunities in agriculture.

00:09:19.704 --> 00:09:24.635
To unlock these opportunities,
through models similar to ours,

00:09:24.659 --> 00:09:30.231
they would require 150 billion dollars
a year in financing.

00:09:32.026 --> 00:09:33.426
This is a big number.

00:09:34.278 --> 00:09:39.724
But if we can tap into commercial debt,
it is a small number --

00:09:39.748 --> 00:09:43.663
only 0.1 percent of all the debt
in the world today,

00:09:43.687 --> 00:09:46.728
10 cents out of every 100 dollars.

00:09:47.347 --> 00:09:49.266
This is why we designed our model

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:53.004
to be very different from conventional
agricultural development programs.

00:09:53.363 --> 00:09:58.607
In a few short years, we have shown
that our model works,

00:09:58.631 --> 00:10:02.417
is high-impact and can turn a profit,

00:10:02.441 --> 00:10:04.117
attracting commercial investors

00:10:04.141 --> 00:10:08.082
that do not typically invest
in small farmers in Africa.

00:10:09.807 --> 00:10:15.045
Imagine a world where millions
of young men across Africa,

00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:17.299
hardworking young men,

00:10:17.323 --> 00:10:18.807
have other options.

00:10:19.998 --> 00:10:25.065
I know these driven, ambitious young men

00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:28.597
will make the right choice.

00:10:31.099 --> 00:10:34.477
We can realize this dream

00:10:36.268 --> 00:10:40.353
if they have a choice.

00:10:41.172 --> 00:10:42.324
Thank you.

00:10:42.348 --> 00:10:46.246
(Applause)
