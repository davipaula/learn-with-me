00:00:06.346 --> 00:00:07.793
This holiday season,

00:00:07.793 --> 00:00:10.722
people around the world will give
and receive presents.

00:00:10.722 --> 00:00:13.425
You might even get 
a knitted sweater from an aunt.

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:17.095
But what if instead of saying "thanks"
before consigning it to the closet,

00:00:17.095 --> 00:00:19.130
the polite response expected from you

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.663
was to show up to her house 
in a week with a better gift?

00:00:22.663 --> 00:00:25.690
Or to vote for her in the town election?

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.462
Or let her adopt your firstborn child?

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:30.922
All of these things might not 
sound so strange

00:00:30.922 --> 00:00:34.228
if you are involved in a gift economy.

00:00:34.228 --> 00:00:36.300
This phrase might seem contradictory.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.215
After all, isn't a gift given for free?

00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:42.810
But in a gift economy,
gifts given without explicit conditions

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.112
are used to foster a system
of social ties and obligations.

00:00:47.112 --> 00:00:50.124
While the market economies we know 
are formed by relationships

00:00:50.124 --> 00:00:52.276
between the things being traded,

00:00:52.276 --> 00:00:54.420
a gift economy consists 
of the relationships

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.216
between the people doing the trading.

00:00:57.216 --> 00:01:00.750
Gift economies have existed 
throughout human history.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.337
The first studies of the concept

00:01:02.337 --> 00:01:06.834
came from anthropologists 
Bronislaw Malinowski and Marcel Mauss

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:09.210
who describe the natives 
of the Trobriand islands

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.260
making dangerous canoe journeys 
across miles of ocean

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.633
to exchange shell necklaces
and arm bands.

00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:18.975
The items traded through this process,
known as the kula ring,

00:01:18.975 --> 00:01:20.542
have no practical use,

00:01:20.542 --> 00:01:23.477
but derive importance 
from their original owners

00:01:23.477 --> 00:01:27.017
and carry an obligation 
to continue the exchange.

00:01:27.017 --> 00:01:29.503
Other gift economies 
may involve useful items,

00:01:29.503 --> 00:01:32.829
such as the potlatch feast 
of the Pacific Northwest,

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.527
where chiefs compete for prestige 
by giving away livestock and blankets.

00:01:37.527 --> 00:01:40.324
We might say that instead 
of accumulating material wealth,

00:01:40.324 --> 00:01:45.257
participants in a gift economy 
use it to accumulate social wealth.

00:01:45.257 --> 00:01:48.871
Though some instances of gift economies
may resemble barter,

00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:53.002
the difference is that the original gift 
is given without any preconditions

00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:54.706
or haggling.

00:01:54.706 --> 00:01:56.827
Instead, the social norm of reciprocity

00:01:56.827 --> 00:02:01.094
obligates recipients to voluntarily 
return the favor.

00:02:01.094 --> 00:02:05.016
But the rules for how and when to do so 
vary between cultures,

00:02:05.016 --> 00:02:08.705
and the return on a gift 
can take many forms.

00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:11.489
A powerful chief giving 
livestock to a poor man

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.001
may not expect goods in return,

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:17.270
but gains social prestige 
at the debtor's expense.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.891
And among the Toraja people of Indonesia,

00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:24.848
the status gained from gift ceremonies 
even determines land ownership.

00:02:24.848 --> 00:02:27.226
The key is to keep the gift cycle going,

00:02:27.226 --> 00:02:29.739
with someone always 
indebted to someone else.

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.127
Repaying a gift immediately,

00:02:31.127 --> 00:02:33.542
or with something of exactly equal value,

00:02:33.542 --> 00:02:37.218
may be read as ending 
the social relationship.

00:02:37.218 --> 00:02:40.693
So, are gift economies exclusive 
to small-scale societies

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:42.969
outside the industrialized world?

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:44.163
Not quite.

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:46.139
For one thing, even in these cultures,

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:50.492
gift economies function alongside 
a market system for other exchanges.

00:02:50.492 --> 00:02:51.986
And when we think about it,

00:02:51.986 --> 00:02:55.530
parts of our own societies 
work in similar ways.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.583
Communal spaces, such as Burning Man,

00:02:57.583 --> 00:03:00.329
operate as a mix of barter 
and a gift economy,

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.711
where selling things 
for money is strictly taboo.

00:03:03.711 --> 00:03:05.174
In art and technology,

00:03:05.174 --> 00:03:08.904
gift economies are emerging 
as an alternative to intellectual property

00:03:08.904 --> 00:03:09.994
where artists,

00:03:09.994 --> 00:03:11.113
musicians,

00:03:11.113 --> 00:03:12.529
and open-source developers

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:15.624
distribute their creative works, 
not for financial profit,

00:03:15.624 --> 00:03:19.908
but to raise their social profile 
or establish their community role.

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:22.475
And even potluck dinners 
and holiday gift traditions

00:03:22.475 --> 00:03:26.179
involve some degree 
of reciprocity and social norms.

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:28.191
We might wonder if a gift is truly a gift

00:03:28.191 --> 00:03:32.364
if it comes with obligations 
or involves some social pay off.

00:03:32.364 --> 00:03:34.150
But this is missing the point.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.519
Our idea of a free gift 
without social obligations

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.771
prevails only if we already think 
of everything in market terms.

00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:43.233
And in a commericalized world,

00:03:43.233 --> 00:03:46.793
the idea of strengthening bonds 
through giving and reciprocity

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:50.406
may not be such a bad thing,
wherever you may live.
