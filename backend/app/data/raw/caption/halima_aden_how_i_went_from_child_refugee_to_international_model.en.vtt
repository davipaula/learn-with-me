00:00:13.592 --> 00:00:15.809
This is me at age seven.

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:19.537
And this is also me.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.821
(Applause and cheering)

00:00:24.845 --> 00:00:29.191
To be standing here in Kakuma
refugee camp feels so surreal,

00:00:29.215 --> 00:00:31.676
and I'm overcome with so much emotion.

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:34.258
These very grounds are where I was born

00:00:34.282 --> 00:00:36.459
and spent the first
seven years of my life.

00:00:37.878 --> 00:00:39.958
I think many people are surprised to hear

00:00:39.982 --> 00:00:42.511
that I had a great upbringing
here at Kakuma.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.499
But I was happy,

00:00:44.523 --> 00:00:46.989
I was smart, I had friends

00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:49.908
and above all, I had hope
for a brighter future.

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:53.921
That's not to say that we didn't
have our obstacles.

00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:55.576
I mean, boy were there struggles.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.090
I would sometimes get sick with malaria

00:00:58.114 --> 00:01:01.572
and didn't always know
where our next meal would come from.

00:01:01.596 --> 00:01:05.022
But the sense of community
that is here in Kakuma

00:01:05.046 --> 00:01:07.491
and the pride that everyone here possesses

00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:09.474
is simply unparalleled.

00:01:11.716 --> 00:01:14.771
When I was younger,
I remember conflicts breaking out.

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:18.414
That tends to happen when people
come from different backgrounds

00:01:18.438 --> 00:01:20.302
and don't speak the same language.

00:01:20.326 --> 00:01:21.607
Eventually, Swahili --

00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:22.870
the main language here --

00:01:22.894 --> 00:01:24.096
became our common ground.

00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:26.795
I made friends with the kids at the camp

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.502
and even started embracing
some of their cultures,

00:01:29.526 --> 00:01:33.172
celebrating holidays like Christmas
even though I was raised Muslim.

00:01:33.772 --> 00:01:36.462
The other kids would embrace
my culture as well,

00:01:36.486 --> 00:01:38.911
sometimes even praying right alongside me.

00:01:39.943 --> 00:01:42.661
It was easy, as children,
to come together,

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:44.137
blend all of our beliefs

00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:47.616
to form our own unique,
multicultural environment.

00:01:49.258 --> 00:01:50.976
My name is Halima Aden

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.680
and I'm a black, Muslim,
Somali-American from Kenya.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.988
(Applause)

00:01:59.012 --> 00:02:01.279
Some have called me a trailblazer --

00:02:01.303 --> 00:02:04.322
I was the first Muslim
homecoming queen at my high school,

00:02:04.346 --> 00:02:07.109
the first Somali student
senator at my college

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:09.940
and the first hijab-wearing
woman in many places,

00:02:09.964 --> 00:02:12.935
like the Miss Minnesota USA
beauty pageant,

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.018
the runways of Milan
and New York Fashion Weeks

00:02:16.042 --> 00:02:19.080
and even on the historic cover
of British "Vogue."

00:02:19.778 --> 00:02:20.928
As you can see,

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.849
I'm not afraid to be the first,
to step out on my own,

00:02:24.873 --> 00:02:26.469
to take risks and seek change,

00:02:26.493 --> 00:02:28.994
because that's what being
a minority is about.

00:02:29.018 --> 00:02:31.939
It's about using yourself
as a vessel to create change

00:02:31.963 --> 00:02:36.476
and being a human representation
for the power of diversity.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.532
And now I use my platform to spread
an important message of acceptance.

00:02:42.472 --> 00:02:44.092
But it hasn't always been easy.

00:02:44.726 --> 00:02:48.535
When we first arrived to the United States
and made St. Louis, Missouri home,

00:02:49.464 --> 00:02:53.427
I remember asking my mom,
"Is this really America?"

00:02:54.194 --> 00:02:57.068
There were things
that were sadly familiar,

00:02:57.092 --> 00:02:58.614
like hearing gunshots at night

00:02:58.638 --> 00:03:00.466
and the streets looking impoverished.

00:03:01.328 --> 00:03:04.164
But there were things
that were also very different.

00:03:04.188 --> 00:03:05.876
Like when I started first grade,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.008
I noticed how the kids played in groups.

00:03:08.032 --> 00:03:10.158
In America, we call them "cliques."

00:03:10.182 --> 00:03:12.417
Back here, we all played together.

00:03:13.024 --> 00:03:14.595
Gender didn't matter,

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:16.764
and race most certainly never mattered.

00:03:17.246 --> 00:03:19.405
I remember asking myself,

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:21.341
"Why don't they understand Swahili?

00:03:21.653 --> 00:03:24.592
Swahili is the language
that brings people together."

00:03:26.605 --> 00:03:27.787
To make matters worse,

00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:31.513
the school I was enrolled in
didn't have an English immersion program.

00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:34.225
So everyday I would get up,

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:36.344
go to school, sit in my desk

00:03:36.368 --> 00:03:37.585
and never learn a thing.

00:03:38.773 --> 00:03:40.770
This is when I started losing hope,

00:03:40.794 --> 00:03:43.876
and I wanted nothing more
than return to Kakuma,

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.056
a refugee camp.

00:03:47.838 --> 00:03:50.747
Soon, my mother learned
that many Somalis found refuge

00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:52.713
in a small town in Minnesota.

00:03:53.113 --> 00:03:55.883
So when I was eight,
we moved to Minnesota.

00:03:57.326 --> 00:04:01.440
My life changed as I met
other students who spoke Somali,

00:04:01.464 --> 00:04:04.719
attended a school that had
an English immersion program

00:04:04.743 --> 00:04:07.482
and found teachers that would go
above and beyond,

00:04:07.506 --> 00:04:10.156
staying there after school hours
and lunch breaks,

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.306
dedicated to helping me
find success in the classroom.

00:04:14.427 --> 00:04:19.332
Being a child refugee has taught me
that one could be stripped of everything:

00:04:19.356 --> 00:04:22.300
food, shelter, clean drinking water,

00:04:22.324 --> 00:04:23.913
even friendship,

00:04:23.937 --> 00:04:27.016
but the one thing that no one
could ever take away from you

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.371
is your education.

00:04:28.778 --> 00:04:31.533
So I made studying my top priority

00:04:31.557 --> 00:04:34.105
and soon started flourishing
within the classroom.

00:04:36.154 --> 00:04:39.381
As I grew older,
I became more aware of others

00:04:39.405 --> 00:04:41.812
and how they viewed
my race and background.

00:04:42.303 --> 00:04:45.670
Specifically, when I started
wearing the head scarf known as a hijab.

00:04:46.665 --> 00:04:49.318
When I first started
wearing it, I was excited.

00:04:49.342 --> 00:04:54.031
I remember admiring my mother's,
and I wanted to emulate her beauty.

00:04:54.055 --> 00:04:56.292
But when I started middle school,

00:04:56.316 --> 00:04:59.092
the students teased me
about not having hair,

00:04:59.116 --> 00:05:00.726
so to prove them wrong,

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.193
I started showing them my hair --

00:05:03.217 --> 00:05:07.321
something that goes against my beliefs,
but something I felt pressured to do.

00:05:07.943 --> 00:05:10.307
I wanted so badly to fit in at the time.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.659
When I reflect on the issues
of race, religion, identity,

00:05:17.683 --> 00:05:19.989
a lot of painful memories come to mind.

00:05:20.644 --> 00:05:23.934
It would be easy for me to blame
those of another culture

00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:26.684
for making me feel the pain I felt,

00:05:26.708 --> 00:05:28.121
but when I think deeper,

00:05:28.145 --> 00:05:31.049
I also recognize that the most impactful,

00:05:31.073 --> 00:05:34.581
positive, life-changing events
that have happened to me

00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:37.224
are thanks to those people
who are different than me.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.259
It was at this moment that I decided
to step outside of my comfort zone

00:05:42.283 --> 00:05:45.437
and compete in a pageant
wearing a hijab and burkini.

00:05:46.422 --> 00:05:49.519
I saw it as an opportunity
to be a voice for women

00:05:49.543 --> 00:05:52.075
who, like myself,
had felt underrepresented.

00:05:53.767 --> 00:05:55.824
And although I didn't capture the crown,

00:05:55.848 --> 00:05:58.299
that experience opened
so many doors for me.

00:05:58.952 --> 00:06:02.943
I was receiving emails and messages
from women all over the world,

00:06:02.967 --> 00:06:07.158
telling me that I've inspired them
by simply staying true to myself.

00:06:08.107 --> 00:06:10.053
The other "firsts" kept coming.

00:06:10.763 --> 00:06:15.504
I was invited to New York City
by fashion icon Carine Roitfeld

00:06:15.528 --> 00:06:17.751
to shoot my very first editorial.

00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:21.776
It was around this time that I became
the first hijab-wearing model,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.344
and in my first year,

00:06:23.368 --> 00:06:26.646
I graced the covers
of nine fashion magazines.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.967
It was a whirlwind, to say the least.

00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:32.360
But with all the overnight success,

00:06:32.384 --> 00:06:35.304
there was one thing
that remained constant --

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:39.115
the thought that this could be
what brings me back here to Kakuma,

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:40.773
the place that I call home.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.977
And just a few months ago,
something incredible happened to me.

00:06:47.767 --> 00:06:50.410
I was in New York City, on a photo shoot,

00:06:50.434 --> 00:06:53.483
when I met South Sudanese
model Adut Akech,

00:06:53.507 --> 00:06:56.628
who also happened to be born
right here in Kakuma.

00:06:58.163 --> 00:07:01.890
That experience in itself
is the definition of hope.

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:04.339
I mean, just imagine:

00:07:04.363 --> 00:07:08.005
two girls born in the same refugee camp,

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:11.971
reunited for the first time
on the cover of British "Vogue."

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:18.089
(Applause and cheering)

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.503
I was given the distinct pleasure
of partnering up with UNICEF,

00:07:22.527 --> 00:07:26.150
knowing firsthand the work
that they do for children in need.

00:07:27.286 --> 00:07:28.946
And I want you to remember

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.976
that although the children
here may be refugees,

00:07:33.016 --> 00:07:34.913
they are children.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:40.325
They deserve every opportunity
to flourish, to hope, to dream --

00:07:41.114 --> 00:07:42.742
to be successful.

00:07:44.522 --> 00:07:49.233
My story began right here
in Kakuma refugee camp,

00:07:49.257 --> 00:07:51.011
a place of hope.

00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:52.652
Thank you.

00:07:52.676 --> 00:07:57.261
(Applause)
