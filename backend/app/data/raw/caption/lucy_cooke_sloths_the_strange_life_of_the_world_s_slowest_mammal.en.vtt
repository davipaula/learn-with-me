00:00:12.992 --> 00:00:14.142
Hello.

00:00:14.651 --> 00:00:19.293
Well, I'm here to talk to you
about my animal muse:

00:00:19.317 --> 00:00:20.730
the sloth.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:23.220
(Laughter)

00:00:23.244 --> 00:00:27.188
I've been documenting the strange lives
of the world's slowest mammal

00:00:27.212 --> 00:00:28.800
for the last 10 years.

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.863
I still remember the first time I saw one.

00:00:31.887 --> 00:00:35.984
I was fascinated by their freaky biology.

00:00:36.008 --> 00:00:39.626
I mean, what's not to love
about an animal that's born

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.642
with a fixed grin on its face?

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.817
(Laughter)

00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:45.880
And the need to hug.

00:00:45.904 --> 00:00:47.396
Audience: Awww.

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:52.023
But sloths are massively misunderstood.

00:00:52.047 --> 00:00:55.298
They've been saddled with a name
that speaks of sin

00:00:55.322 --> 00:00:58.514
and damned for their languorous lifestyle,

00:00:58.538 --> 00:01:02.117
which people seem to think
has no place amongst the fittest

00:01:02.141 --> 00:01:04.630
in the fast-paced race for survival.

00:01:05.268 --> 00:01:10.482
Well, I'm here to tell you
that we've got this animal all wrong --

00:01:10.506 --> 00:01:13.537
and how understanding
the truth about the sloth

00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:18.438
may help save us and this planet
we both call home.

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:22.029
I traced sloth-based slander

00:01:22.053 --> 00:01:26.339
back to a Spanish
conquistador called Valdés,

00:01:26.363 --> 00:01:31.601
who gave the first description of a sloth
in his encyclopedia of the New World.

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:33.540
He said the sloth was

00:01:33.564 --> 00:01:36.847
"the stupidest animal
that can be found in the world ...

00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:42.061
I have never seen such an ugly animal
or one that is more useless."

00:01:42.085 --> 00:01:43.235
(Laughter)

00:01:43.744 --> 00:01:45.866
Tell us what you really think, Valdés.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.040
(Laughter)

00:01:47.522 --> 00:01:51.697
I'd like to have a word
about Valdés's drawing skills.

00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:53.792
(Laughter)

00:01:53.816 --> 00:01:56.263
I mean, what is that?

00:01:56.287 --> 00:01:58.134
(Laughter)

00:01:58.158 --> 00:02:01.695
I've never seen an illustration
of a sloth that's more useless.

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:02.950
(Laughter)

00:02:02.974 --> 00:02:04.379
But I mean, on the plus side,

00:02:04.403 --> 00:02:06.854
he has given the sloth
a remarkably humanlike face,

00:02:06.878 --> 00:02:10.445
and sloths do have remarkably
humanlike faces.

00:02:10.966 --> 00:02:15.976
This sloth I photographed in Costa Rica,
I think looks a lot like Ringo Starr.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.895
(Laughter)

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:22.768
But then, sloths do bear an uncanny
resemblance to the The Beatles.

00:02:22.792 --> 00:02:26.108
(Laughter)

00:02:26.132 --> 00:02:29.808
Particularly pleased
with Paul, actually, on there.

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:36.149
But like The Beatles,
sloths are also extremely successful.

00:02:36.173 --> 00:02:40.122
They come from an ancient line of mammals,
and there were once dozens of species

00:02:40.146 --> 00:02:44.688
including the giant ground sloth,
which was the size of a small elephant

00:02:44.712 --> 00:02:48.975
and one of the only animals big enough
to eat avocado pits whole

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:50.391
and disperse them.

00:02:51.384 --> 00:02:52.534
So ... 
(Laughter)

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.203
Some of you have worked it out already.

00:02:55.227 --> 00:02:56.229
(Laughter)

00:02:56.253 --> 00:02:58.246
That means that without sloths,

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.569
there might be no avocado on toast today,

00:03:01.593 --> 00:03:05.934
leaving hipsters everywhere
totally bereft at breakfast.

00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.769
(Laughter)

00:03:07.793 --> 00:03:13.230
(Applause)

00:03:13.254 --> 00:03:17.144
Today, there are six surviving species,
and they fall into two groups.

00:03:17.168 --> 00:03:19.768
You've got your Bradypus
three-toed sloths,

00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:23.638
they're the ones with the Beatles haircuts
and the Mona Lisa smiles.

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.902
Then, there are the two-toed sloths.

00:03:27.495 --> 00:03:30.756
They look a little bit more like a cross
between a Wookiee and a pig.

00:03:31.891 --> 00:03:34.501
They live in the jungles
of Central and South America,

00:03:34.525 --> 00:03:36.021
and they're extremely prolific.

00:03:36.045 --> 00:03:38.998
There was a survey
that was done in the 1970s

00:03:39.022 --> 00:03:41.276
in a Panamanian tropical forest

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.204
that found that sloths were the most
numerically abundant large animal.

00:03:46.228 --> 00:03:49.990
They took up one quarter
of the mammalian biomass.

00:03:50.014 --> 00:03:53.195
Now, that's an awful lot of sloths

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:57.513
and suggests they're doing
something very right indeed.

00:03:58.188 --> 00:04:04.979
So what if, rather than deriding
the sloth for being different,

00:04:05.003 --> 00:04:07.478
we tried to learn from it instead?

00:04:09.085 --> 00:04:12.889
We humans are obsessed with speed.

00:04:13.236 --> 00:04:15.247
Busyness is a badge of honor,

00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:19.806
and convenience trumps quality
in our quest for quick.

00:04:20.553 --> 00:04:25.665
Our addiction to the express life
is choking us and the planet.

00:04:26.773 --> 00:04:32.093
We idolize animals like the cheetah,
the "Ferrari of the animal kingdom,"

00:04:32.117 --> 00:04:36.337
capable of doing naught to 60
in three seconds flat.

00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:37.941
Well, so what?

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:42.007
(Laughter)

00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:45.767
(Applause)

00:04:46.109 --> 00:04:47.260
So what?

00:04:47.284 --> 00:04:48.776
The sloth, on the other hand,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.760
can reach a leisurely 17 feet a minute

00:04:52.784 --> 00:04:54.395
with the wind behind it.

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.521
(Laughter)

00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:59.395
But being fast is costly.

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.403
The cheetah is speedy,
but at the expense of strength.

00:05:03.427 --> 00:05:05.180
They can't risk getting in a fight,

00:05:05.204 --> 00:05:09.569
so they lose one in nine kills
to tougher predators like hyenas.

00:05:09.593 --> 00:05:11.157
No wonder they're laughing.

00:05:11.181 --> 00:05:12.331
(Laughter)

00:05:12.355 --> 00:05:13.752
The sloth, on the other hand,

00:05:13.776 --> 00:05:16.704
has taken a more stealthy
approach to dinner.

00:05:16.728 --> 00:05:20.467
They survive by capturing and consuming

00:05:20.491 --> 00:05:22.328
static leaves.

00:05:22.352 --> 00:05:24.421
(Laughter)

00:05:24.445 --> 00:05:27.715
But you see, leaves don't want
to be eaten any more than antelope do,

00:05:27.739 --> 00:05:31.087
so they're loaded full of toxins
and very hard to digest.

00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:32.746
So in order to consume them,

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.230
the sloth has also
had to become an athlete --

00:05:36.254 --> 00:05:38.420
a digesting athlete.

00:05:38.444 --> 00:05:39.556
(Laughter)

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.288
The sloth's secret weapon
is a four-chambered stomach

00:05:42.312 --> 00:05:44.537
and plenty of time.

00:05:44.561 --> 00:05:47.458
They have the slowest
digestion rate of any mammal.

00:05:47.482 --> 00:05:51.077
And it can take up to a month
to process a single leaf,

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:55.415
which gives their liver plenty of time
to process those toxins.

00:05:55.876 --> 00:05:59.510
So, sloths aren't lazy.

00:06:00.122 --> 00:06:02.277
No, they're busy.

00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:04.033
Digesting.

00:06:04.057 --> 00:06:05.553
(Laughter)

00:06:05.577 --> 00:06:07.670
Yeah, really busy.

00:06:07.694 --> 00:06:09.474
(Laughter)

00:06:09.498 --> 00:06:12.807
Hard at work, that sloth,
very hard at work.

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:15.498
And of course, leaves
have little calorific value,

00:06:15.522 --> 00:06:19.736
so sloths have evolved to spend
as little energy as possible.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.125
They do about 10 percent of the work
of a similar-sized mammal

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:26.982
and survive on as little
as 100 calories a day,

00:06:27.006 --> 00:06:30.174
thanks to some ingenious adaptations.

00:06:31.053 --> 00:06:32.863
The Bradypus, three-toed sloths,

00:06:32.887 --> 00:06:35.355
they've got more neck bones
than any other mammal,

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:36.545
even a giraffe.

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:41.096
Which means they can turn their head
through 270 degrees

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.254
and graze all around them,

00:06:43.278 --> 00:06:47.356
without having to actually bother
with the effort of moving their body.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.333
(Laughter)

00:06:50.292 --> 00:06:53.926
It also means that they are
surprisingly good swimmers.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.415
Sloths can bob along in water

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:59.704
three times faster
than they can move on land,

00:06:59.728 --> 00:07:01.698
kept afloat by ...

00:07:01.722 --> 00:07:03.260
trapped wind.

00:07:03.284 --> 00:07:05.346
(Laughter)

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.544
So --

00:07:06.568 --> 00:07:07.569
(Laughter)

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:11.504
sloths are the only mammal that we know of
that don't do flatulence.

00:07:11.528 --> 00:07:13.210
When they need to expel gas,

00:07:13.234 --> 00:07:16.052
it's actually reabsorbed
into their bloodstream

00:07:16.076 --> 00:07:19.941
and expelled orally
as a sort of mouth fart.

00:07:19.965 --> 00:07:23.014
(Laughter)

00:07:23.884 --> 00:07:27.352
Turning their lives upside down
saves further energy.

00:07:27.376 --> 00:07:31.509
They have about half the skeletal muscle
of a terrestrial mammal.

00:07:31.533 --> 00:07:35.785
They don't really have so many
of the extensor muscles

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:37.548
that are the weight-bearing muscles;

00:07:37.572 --> 00:07:41.075
instead, they rely on retractor muscles
to pull themselves along.

00:07:41.913 --> 00:07:45.957
They have long, hooked claws
and a high fatigue resistance,

00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:50.965
so they can literally hook on and hang
like a happy, hairy hammock

00:07:50.989 --> 00:07:52.845
for hours on end.

00:07:52.869 --> 00:07:56.434
And sloths can do almost anything
in this inverted position.

00:07:56.458 --> 00:07:59.133
They sleep, eat and even give birth.

00:07:59.157 --> 00:08:02.506
Their throat and blood vessels
are uniquely adapted

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:06.488
to pump blood and to swallow food
against the force of gravity.

00:08:06.512 --> 00:08:08.998
They have sticky bits on their ribs

00:08:09.022 --> 00:08:12.816
that prevent their enormous stomach
from crushing their lungs.

00:08:13.258 --> 00:08:16.022
And their fur grows
the opposite direction,

00:08:16.046 --> 00:08:19.490
so they can drip dry
after a tropical drenching.

00:08:20.704 --> 00:08:25.667
The only problem is,
if you turn a sloth the other way up,

00:08:25.691 --> 00:08:28.783
gravity removes its dignity.

00:08:28.807 --> 00:08:30.017
Audience: Awww.

00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:32.839
They can't hold themselves upright.

00:08:32.863 --> 00:08:37.521
And so they drag their bodies along
as if mountaineering on a flat surface.

00:08:37.974 --> 00:08:40.895
And I think this is why
the early explorers like Valdés

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.180
thought so poorly of them,

00:08:42.204 --> 00:08:46.631
because they were observing sloths
the wrong way up and out of context.

00:08:48.251 --> 00:08:53.379
I've spent many happy hours
mesmerized by moving sloths.

00:08:53.403 --> 00:08:57.328
Their lack of muscle hasn't impeded
their strength or agility.

00:08:57.703 --> 00:09:03.232
Nature's zen masters of mellow
move like "Swan Lake" in slow mo --

00:09:03.256 --> 00:09:04.724
(Laughter)

00:09:04.748 --> 00:09:08.112
with the core control of a tai chi master.

00:09:08.537 --> 00:09:13.634
This one has fallen asleep mid-move,
which is not uncommon.

00:09:13.658 --> 00:09:17.144
(Laughter)

00:09:17.728 --> 00:09:19.197
But you're probably wondering:

00:09:19.221 --> 00:09:23.101
How does a dangling bag
of digesting leaves avoid being eaten?

00:09:23.411 --> 00:09:24.569
Good question.

00:09:24.593 --> 00:09:26.918
Well, this is one
of the sloth's main predators.

00:09:26.942 --> 00:09:28.342
It's the harpy eagle.

00:09:28.712 --> 00:09:31.291
It can fly at speeds
of up to 50 miles per hour,

00:09:31.315 --> 00:09:34.006
has talons the size of a grizzly bear's,

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.641
razor-sharp eyesight,

00:09:35.665 --> 00:09:38.458
and that ring of feathers focuses sound

00:09:38.482 --> 00:09:41.188
so that it can hear
the slightest leaf rustle.

00:09:41.564 --> 00:09:46.651
The sloth, on the other hand,
has poor hearing, bad eyesight,

00:09:46.675 --> 00:09:49.606
and running from danger
is clearly not an option.

00:09:50.175 --> 00:09:54.147
No, they survive by wearing
an invisibility cloak

00:09:54.171 --> 00:09:56.067
worthy of Harry Potter.

00:09:56.965 --> 00:10:00.093
Their fur has grooves
that attract moisture

00:10:00.117 --> 00:10:03.450
and act as tiny hydroponic
gardens for algae,

00:10:03.474 --> 00:10:06.101
and they also attract
a host of invertebrates.

00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:10.942
So they are their own slow-moving,
miniature ecosystem.

00:10:10.966 --> 00:10:13.569
They become one with the trees.

00:10:13.593 --> 00:10:16.163
And we think that
their movements are so slow,

00:10:16.187 --> 00:10:18.839
they slip under the radar
of the monstrous harpy

00:10:18.863 --> 00:10:22.236
as it's flying about the canopy,
scanning for action.

00:10:23.244 --> 00:10:25.903
Sloths are stealth ninjas,

00:10:25.927 --> 00:10:28.537
and they rarely leave
the safety of the canopy --

00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:30.339
except to defecate,

00:10:30.363 --> 00:10:33.704
which they do about once a week
at the base of a tree.

00:10:34.387 --> 00:10:38.863
Now, this risky and energetic behavior
has long been a mystery,

00:10:38.887 --> 00:10:41.776
and there are lots of theories
as to why they do it.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:48.288
But I think they're leaving surreptitious
scented messages for potential mates.

00:10:48.862 --> 00:10:53.855
Because, you see, sloths are generally
silent, solitary creatures,

00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:56.291
except for when the female is in heat.

00:10:56.315 --> 00:11:00.827
She will climb to the top of a tree
and scream for sex.

00:11:01.498 --> 00:11:02.727
In D-sharp.

00:11:02.751 --> 00:11:04.728
(Laughter)

00:11:04.752 --> 00:11:05.902
Don't believe me?

00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:08.825
(Sound of sloth scream)

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.450
D-sharp.

00:11:11.085 --> 00:11:14.354
This and only this note
will get the male's attention.

00:11:14.378 --> 00:11:16.884
It mimics the sound
of the kiskadee flycatcher.

00:11:16.908 --> 00:11:18.859
So the female remains covert,

00:11:18.883 --> 00:11:22.146
even when yodeling for sex
at the top of her lungs.

00:11:22.825 --> 00:11:27.412
Her clandestine booty calls
will carry for miles across the canopy,

00:11:27.436 --> 00:11:30.922
and males will beat
a slow path towards her.

00:11:30.946 --> 00:11:35.239
(Laughter)

00:11:35.263 --> 00:11:39.978
I think scented messages in her dung
will help send Romeo up the right tree

00:11:40.002 --> 00:11:43.859
so that he doesn't waste precious energy
scaling the wrong one.

00:11:44.807 --> 00:11:48.244
Sex, by the way, is the only thing
that sloths do swiftly.

00:11:48.268 --> 00:11:49.879
I've seen them do it in the wild,

00:11:49.903 --> 00:11:53.339
and it's over and done
with in a matter of seconds.

00:11:53.363 --> 00:11:56.061
But then, why waste precious energy on it,

00:11:56.085 --> 00:11:58.093
particularly after that journey?

00:11:58.117 --> 00:11:59.799
(Laughter)

00:11:59.823 --> 00:12:01.101
Unlike other mammals,

00:12:01.125 --> 00:12:06.268
sloths don't also waste time maintaining
a constant warm body temperature.

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:07.982
Energy from the sun is free,

00:12:08.006 --> 00:12:10.276
so they bask in the sun like lizards

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:15.466
and wear an unusually thick coat
for the tropics to keep that heat in.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:19.561
Sloths have a freakishly low metabolism.

00:12:19.585 --> 00:12:22.157
And we think that this might be
one of the reasons

00:12:22.181 --> 00:12:24.646
that they can sometimes
recover from injuries

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:26.632
that would kill most animals.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.331
This sloth recovered
from a double amputation,

00:12:30.355 --> 00:12:33.982
and I've known sloths
that have managed to survive

00:12:34.006 --> 00:12:36.379
even power line electrocutions.

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:42.196
And we now think that a low metabolism
may well be key to surviving extinction.

00:12:42.631 --> 00:12:46.101
Researchers at Kansas University
who were studying mollusks

00:12:46.125 --> 00:12:50.553
found that a high metabolism
predicted which species of mollusk

00:12:50.577 --> 00:12:51.958
had gone extinct.

00:12:53.609 --> 00:12:56.585
Sloths have been around on this planet
in one shape or another

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:59.251
for over 40 million years.

00:12:59.768 --> 00:13:04.156
The secret to their success
is their slothful nature.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:08.339
They are energy-saving icons.

00:13:09.022 --> 00:13:11.427
And I founded the Sloth
Appreciation Society

00:13:11.451 --> 00:13:17.283
to both promote and protect
their slow, steady, sustainable lives.

00:13:18.712 --> 00:13:20.712
I'm a pretty speedy character.

00:13:21.529 --> 00:13:22.966
I'm sure you've guessed.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:26.728
And the sloths have taught me
a lot about slowing down.

00:13:26.752 --> 00:13:29.149
And I think that the planet would benefit

00:13:29.173 --> 00:13:34.125
if we all took a slowly digested
leaf out of their book.

00:13:34.752 --> 00:13:38.783
How about we all embrace our inner sloth

00:13:38.807 --> 00:13:40.370
by slowing down,

00:13:40.394 --> 00:13:41.909
being more mindful,

00:13:41.933 --> 00:13:44.401
reducing wasteful convenience,

00:13:44.425 --> 00:13:47.128
being economical with our energy,

00:13:47.152 --> 00:13:49.171
recycling creatively

00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:51.869
and reconnecting with nature.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.090
Otherwise, I fear,

00:13:55.114 --> 00:13:58.438
it will be us humans that turn out to be

00:13:58.462 --> 00:14:02.109
"the stupidest animals
that can be found in the world."

00:14:03.622 --> 00:14:05.246
Thank you very much.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:06.668
May the sloth be with you!

00:14:06.692 --> 00:14:10.047
(Applause)
