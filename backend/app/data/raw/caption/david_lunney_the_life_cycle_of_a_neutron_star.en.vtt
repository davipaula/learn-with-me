00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:10.792
About once every century,

00:00:10.792 --> 00:00:13.602
a massive star somewhere in our galaxy

00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:15.222
runs out of fuel.

00:00:15.222 --> 00:00:18.722
This happens after millions of years 
of heat and pressure

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:20.962
have fused the star’s hydrogen

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:27.222
into heavier elements like helium,
carbon, and nitrogen— all the way to iron.

00:00:27.222 --> 00:00:31.322
No longer able to produce sufficient 
energy to maintain its structure,

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:36.862
it collapses under its own gravitational 
pressure and explodes in a supernova.

00:00:36.862 --> 00:00:39.972
The star shoots most of its 
innards into space,

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:42.472
seeding the galaxy with heavy elements.

00:00:42.472 --> 00:00:48.222
But what this cataclysmic eruption leaves
behind might be even more remarkable:

00:00:48.222 --> 00:00:51.752
a ball of matter so dense that 
atomic electrons

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:56.265
collapse from their quantum orbits 
into the depths of atomic nuclei.

00:00:56.265 --> 00:00:59.925
The death of that star 
is the birth of a neutron star:

00:00:59.925 --> 00:01:03.295
one of the densest known objects 
in the universe,

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:08.835
and a laboratory for the strange physics 
of supercondensed matter.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:11.024
But what is a neutron star?

00:01:11.024 --> 00:01:17.124
Think of a compact ball inside of which 
protons and electrons fuse into neutrons

00:01:17.124 --> 00:01:21.084
and form a frictionless liquid 
called a superfluid—

00:01:21.084 --> 00:01:23.274
surrounded by a crust.

00:01:23.274 --> 00:01:25.704
This material is incredibly dense –

00:01:25.704 --> 00:01:29.154
the equivalent of the mass of a 
fully-loaded container ship

00:01:29.154 --> 00:01:32.264
squeezed into a human hair,

00:01:32.264 --> 00:01:37.364
or the mass of Mount Everest 
in a space of a sugar cube.

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:41.832
Deeper in the crust, the neutron 
superfluid forms different phases

00:01:41.832 --> 00:01:45.032
that physicists call “nuclear pasta,”

00:01:45.032 --> 00:01:49.362
as it’s squeezed from lasagna 
to spaghetti-like shapes.

00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:53.259
The massive precursors to 
neutron stars often spin.

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.229
When they collapse,

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.339
stars that are typically millions of 
kilometers wide

00:01:57.339 --> 00:02:02.649
compress down to neutron stars that are
only about 25 kilometers across.

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.852
But the original star’s angular 
momentum is preserved.

00:02:06.852 --> 00:02:10.362
So for the same reason that a figure 
skater’s spin accelerates

00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:12.052
when they bring in their arms,

00:02:12.052 --> 00:02:16.342
the neutron star spins much more 
rapidly than its parent.

00:02:16.342 --> 00:02:22.592
The fastest neutron star on record 
rotates over 700 times every second,

00:02:22.592 --> 00:02:26.002
which means that a point on its surface 
whirls through space

00:02:26.002 --> 00:02:29.155
at more than a fifth 
of the speed of light.

00:02:29.155 --> 00:02:34.305
Neutron stars also have the strongest 
magnetic field of any known object.

00:02:34.305 --> 00:02:37.705
This magnetic concentration
forms vortexes

00:02:37.705 --> 00:02:40.875
that radiate beams 
from the magnetic poles.

00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:44.985
Since the poles aren’t always aligned 
with the rotational axis of the star,

00:02:44.985 --> 00:02:48.125
the beams spin like lighthouse beacons,

00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:50.875
which appear to blink 
when viewed from Earth.

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:53.235
We call those pulsars.

00:02:53.235 --> 00:02:56.815
The detection of one of these 
tantalizing flashing signals

00:02:56.815 --> 00:03:00.945
by astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell in 1967

00:03:00.945 --> 00:03:04.895
was in fact the way we indirectly
discovered neutron stars

00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:06.545
in the first place.

00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:12.585
An aging neutron star’s furious rotation
slows over a period of billions of years

00:03:12.585 --> 00:03:18.485
as it radiates away its energy in the form
of electromagnetic and gravity waves.

00:03:18.485 --> 00:03:22.055
But not all neutron stars 
disappear so quietly.

00:03:22.055 --> 00:03:25.095
For example, we’ve observed binary systems

00:03:25.095 --> 00:03:28.445
where a neutron star 
co-orbits another star.

00:03:28.445 --> 00:03:31.435
A neutron star can feed on 
a lighter companion,

00:03:31.435 --> 00:03:34.445
gorging on its more 
loosely bound atmosphere

00:03:34.445 --> 00:03:39.397
before eventually collapsing
cataclysmically into a black hole.

00:03:39.397 --> 00:03:42.098
While many stars exist as binary systems,

00:03:42.098 --> 00:03:46.488
only a small percentage of those end up 
as neutron-star binaries,

00:03:46.488 --> 00:03:52.398
where two neutron stars circle each other 
in a waltz doomed to end as a merger.

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:56.508
When they finally collide, they send 
gravity waves through space-time

00:03:56.508 --> 00:04:00.548
like ripples from a stone 
thrown into a calm lake.

00:04:00.548 --> 00:04:02.728
Einstein’s theory of General Relativity

00:04:02.728 --> 00:04:07.768
predicted this phenomenon over 100 years
ago, but it wasn't directly verified

00:04:07.768 --> 00:04:09.818
until 2017,

00:04:09.818 --> 00:04:14.028
when gravitational-wave observatories 
LIGO and VIRGO

00:04:14.028 --> 00:04:17.018
observed a neutron star collision.

00:04:17.018 --> 00:04:21.271
Other telescopes picked up a burst of 
gamma rays and a flash of light,

00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:26.371
and, later, x-rays and radio signals, 
all from the same impact.

00:04:26.371 --> 00:04:30.501
That became the most studied event 
in the history of astronomy.

00:04:30.501 --> 00:04:32.691
It yielded a treasure trove of data

00:04:32.691 --> 00:04:34.906
that’s helped pin down the speed 
of gravity,

00:04:34.906 --> 00:04:37.736
bolster important theories 
in astrophysics,

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:43.566
and provide evidence for the origin 
of heavy elements like gold and platinum.

00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:47.026
Neutron stars haven’t given up 
all their secrets yet.

00:04:47.026 --> 00:04:51.606
LIGO and VIRGO are being upgraded 
to detect more collisions.

00:04:51.606 --> 00:04:53.316
That’ll help us learn what else

00:04:53.316 --> 00:04:58.306
the spectacular demise of these dense, 
pulsating, spinning magnets

00:04:58.306 --> 00:05:02.386
can tell us about the universe.
