00:00:06.912 --> 00:00:09.912
In 1901, David Hänig published a paper

00:00:09.912 --> 00:00:13.930
that forever changed 
our understanding of taste.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.727
His research led to what we know 
today as the taste map:

00:00:17.727 --> 00:00:22.278
an illustration that divides the tongue 
into four separate areas.

00:00:22.278 --> 00:00:23.588
According to this map,

00:00:23.588 --> 00:00:27.028
receptors at the tip of our tongues
capture sweetness,

00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:29.700
bitterness 
is detected at the tongue’s base,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.985
and along the sides, receptors capture 
salty and sour sensations.

00:00:34.985 --> 00:00:37.915
Since its invention, the taste map 
has been published

00:00:37.915 --> 00:00:40.150
in textbooks and newspapers.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.660
The only problem with this map, 
is that it’s wrong.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.930
In fact, it’s not even 
an accurate representation

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.890
of what Hänig originally discovered.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.580
The tongue map is a common misconception—

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.268
something widely believed 
but largely incorrect.

00:00:56.268 --> 00:00:59.028
So where do misconceptions 
like this come from,

00:00:59.028 --> 00:01:03.368
and what makes a fake fact 
so easy to believe?

00:01:03.368 --> 00:01:07.269
It’s true that the tongue map’s 
journey begins with David Hänig.

00:01:07.269 --> 00:01:10.318
As part of his dissertation 
at Leipzig University,

00:01:10.318 --> 00:01:16.271
Hänig analyzed taste sensitivities across 
the tongue for the four basic flavors.

00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:20.081
Using sucrose for sweet, 
quinine sulfate for bitter,

00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:23.928
hydrochloric acid for sour, 
and salt for salty,

00:01:23.928 --> 00:01:28.911
Hänig applied these stimuli to compare 
differences in taste thresholds

00:01:28.911 --> 00:01:31.091
across a subject’s tongue.

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:34.278
He hoped to better understand 
the physiological mechanisms

00:01:34.278 --> 00:01:36.361
that affected these four flavors,

00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:39.841
and his data suggested that sensitivity 
for each taste

00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:42.758
did in fact vary across the tongue.

00:01:42.758 --> 00:01:47.068
The maximum sensation for sweet 
was located at the tongue’s tip;

00:01:47.068 --> 00:01:51.844
bitter flavors were strongest at the back;
salt was strongest in this area,

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:54.854
and sour at the middle 
of the tongue’s sides.

00:01:54.854 --> 00:01:57.908
But Hänig was careful 
to note that every sensation

00:01:57.908 --> 00:02:00.838
could also be tasted across the tongue,

00:02:00.838 --> 00:02:06.591
and that the areas he identified offered 
very small variations in intensity.

00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:08.741
Like so many misconceptions,

00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:12.598
the tongue map represents a distortion 
of its original source,

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:15.698
however the nature of that distortion 
can vary.

00:02:15.698 --> 00:02:19.218
Some misconceptions 
are comprised of disinformation—

00:02:19.218 --> 00:02:23.248
false information intentionally designed 
to mislead people.

00:02:23.248 --> 00:02:26.337
But many misconceptions, 
including the tongue map,

00:02:26.337 --> 00:02:30.477
center on misinformation—
false or misleading information

00:02:30.477 --> 00:02:34.758
that results from unintentional 
inaccuracy.

00:02:34.758 --> 00:02:39.107
Misinformation is most often shaped 
by mistakes and human error,

00:02:39.107 --> 00:02:42.110
but the specific mistakes 
that lead to a misconception

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.628
can be surprisingly varied.

00:02:44.628 --> 00:02:46.268
In the case of the tongue map,

00:02:46.268 --> 00:02:49.328
Hänig’s dissertation was written 
in German,

00:02:49.328 --> 00:02:53.386
meaning the paper could only be 
understood by readers fluent in German

00:02:53.386 --> 00:02:57.426
and well versed in Hanig’s 
small corner of academia.

00:02:57.426 --> 00:03:01.791
This kicked off a game of telephone 
that re-shaped Häing’s research

00:03:01.791 --> 00:03:04.988
every time it was shared 
with outside parties.

00:03:04.988 --> 00:03:07.636
Less than a decade after his dissertation,

00:03:07.636 --> 00:03:10.946
newspapers were falsely insisting 
that experiments

00:03:10.946 --> 00:03:15.865
could prove sweetness was imperceptible 
on the back of the tongue.

00:03:15.865 --> 00:03:18.545
The second culprit 
behind the tongue map’s spread

00:03:18.545 --> 00:03:21.626
were the images 
that Hänig’s work inspired.

00:03:21.626 --> 00:03:26.543
In 1912, a rough version of the map 
appeared in a newspaper article

00:03:26.543 --> 00:03:29.393
that cautiously described 
some of the mysteries

00:03:29.393 --> 00:03:32.136
behind taste and smell research.

00:03:32.136 --> 00:03:36.226
Featuring clear labels across the tongue,
the article’s illustration

00:03:36.226 --> 00:03:40.226
simplified Hänig’s more-complicated 
original diagrams.

00:03:40.226 --> 00:03:44.945
Variations of this approachable image 
became repeatedly cited,

00:03:44.945 --> 00:03:49.461
often without credit or nuanced 
consideration for Hänig’s work.

00:03:49.461 --> 00:03:53.461
Eventually this image spread 
to textbooks and classrooms

00:03:53.461 --> 00:03:57.516
as a purported truth 
of how we experience taste.

00:03:57.516 --> 00:04:01.336
But perhaps the factor that most 
contributed to this misconception

00:04:01.336 --> 00:04:03.976
was its narrative simplicity.

00:04:03.976 --> 00:04:04.966
In many ways,

00:04:04.966 --> 00:04:10.148
the map complements our desire for clear 
stories about the world around us—

00:04:10.148 --> 00:04:14.998
a quality not always present 
in the sometimes-messy fields of science.

00:04:14.998 --> 00:04:15.868
For example,

00:04:15.868 --> 00:04:21.044
even the number of tastes we have is more 
complicated than Hänig’s work suggests.

00:04:21.044 --> 00:04:26.617
Umami— also known as savory— 
is now considered the fifth basic taste,

00:04:26.617 --> 00:04:29.767
and many still debate 
the existence of tastes

00:04:29.767 --> 00:04:34.498
like fatty, alkaline, metallic, 
and water-like.

00:04:34.498 --> 00:04:36.268
Once we hear a good story,

00:04:36.268 --> 00:04:39.815
it can be difficult to change 
how we see that information,

00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:42.315
even in the face of new evidence.

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:47.181
So, next time you see a convenient chart 
or read a surprising anecdote,

00:04:47.181 --> 00:04:49.911
try to maintain a healthy skepticism—

00:04:49.911 --> 00:04:52.617
because misconceptions 
can leave a bitter taste

00:04:52.617 --> 00:04:54.907
on every part of your tongue.
