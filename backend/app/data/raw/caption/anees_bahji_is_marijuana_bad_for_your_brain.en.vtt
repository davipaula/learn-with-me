00:00:06.224 --> 00:00:07.724
In 1970,

00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:13.144
marijuana was classified 
as a schedule 1 drug in the United States:

00:00:13.144 --> 00:00:15.737
the strictest designation possible,

00:00:15.737 --> 00:00:20.779
meaning it was completely illegal 
and had no recognized medical uses.

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.529
For decades, this view persisted

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.538
and set back research 
on the drug's mechanisms and effects.

00:00:28.538 --> 00:00:33.028
Today, marijuana’s therapeutic benefits 
are widely acknowledged,

00:00:33.028 --> 00:00:36.092
and some nations 
have legalized medical use

00:00:36.092 --> 00:00:38.482
or are moving in that direction.

00:00:38.482 --> 00:00:42.381
But a growing recognition 
for marijuana’s medical value

00:00:42.381 --> 00:00:44.081
doesn’t answer the question:

00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:49.095
is recreational marijuana use 
bad for your brain?

00:00:49.095 --> 00:00:52.805
Marijuana acts 
on the body’s cannabinoid system,

00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:56.445
which has receptors 
all over the brain and body.

00:00:56.445 --> 00:01:01.036
Molecules native to the body, 
called endocannabinoids,

00:01:01.036 --> 00:01:03.696
also act on these receptors.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:07.471
We don’t totally understand 
the cannabinoid system,

00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:12.137
but it has one feature 
that provides a big clue to its function.

00:01:12.137 --> 00:01:15.887
Most neurotransmitters 
travel from one neuron to the next

00:01:15.887 --> 00:01:19.457
through a synapse to propagate a message.

00:01:19.457 --> 00:01:23.223
But endocannabinoids 
travel in the opposite direction.

00:01:23.223 --> 00:01:26.716
When a message passes 
from the one neuron to the next,

00:01:26.716 --> 00:01:30.631
the receiving neuron 
releases endocannabinoids.

00:01:30.631 --> 00:01:33.608
Those endocannabinoids 
travel backward

00:01:33.608 --> 00:01:35.748
to influence the sending neuron—

00:01:35.748 --> 00:01:40.416
essentially giving it feedback 
from the receiving neuron.

00:01:40.416 --> 00:01:44.496
This leads scientists 
to believe that the endocannabinoid system

00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:48.294
serves primarily 
to modulate other kinds of signals—

00:01:48.294 --> 00:01:51.832
amplifying some and diminishing others.

00:01:51.832 --> 00:01:57.156
Feedback from endocannabinoids 
slows down rates of neural signaling.

00:01:57.156 --> 00:01:59.088
That doesn’t necessarily mean

00:01:59.088 --> 00:02:01.918
it slows down behavior 
or perception, though.

00:02:01.918 --> 00:02:05.978
For example, 
slowing down a signal that inhibits smell

00:02:05.978 --> 00:02:09.652
could actually make smells more intense.

00:02:09.652 --> 00:02:13.497
Marijuana contains 
two main active compounds,

00:02:13.497 --> 00:02:21.900
tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, 
and cannabidiol, or CBD.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.605
THC is thought to be primarily responsible
for marijuana’s psychoactive effects

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:30.471
on behavior, cognition, and perception,

00:02:30.471 --> 00:02:35.413
while CBD is responsible 
for the non-psychoactive effects.

00:02:35.413 --> 00:02:37.773
Like endocannabinoids,

00:02:37.773 --> 00:02:43.361
THC slows down signaling 
by binding to cannabinoid receptors.

00:02:43.361 --> 00:02:47.474
But it binds to receptors 
all over this sprawling, diffuse system

00:02:47.474 --> 00:02:48.324
at once,

00:02:48.324 --> 00:02:52.294
whereas endocannabinoids 
are released in a specific place

00:02:52.294 --> 00:02:55.221
in response to a specific stimulus.

00:02:55.221 --> 00:02:58.021
This widespread activity 
coupled with the fact

00:02:58.021 --> 00:03:02.421
that the cannabinoid system
indirectly affects many other systems,

00:03:02.421 --> 00:03:06.560
means that each person’s 
particular brain chemistry, genetics,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.940
and previous life experience

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.989
largely determine 
how they experience the drug.

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.099
That’s true much more so with marijuana 
than with other drugs

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.731
that produce their effects 
through one or a few specific pathways.

00:03:20.731 --> 00:03:26.170
So the harmful effects, if any, 
vary considerably from person to person.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.730
And while we don’t know 
how exactly how marijuana

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.213
produces specific harmful effects,

00:03:31.213 --> 00:03:34.859
there are clear risk factors 
that can increase peoples’ likelihood

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.036
of experiencing them.

00:03:37.036 --> 00:03:40.003
The clearest risk factor is age.

00:03:40.003 --> 00:03:42.133
In people younger than 25,

00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:46.113
cannabinoid receptors 
are more concentrated in the white matter

00:03:46.113 --> 00:03:48.533
than in people over 25.

00:03:48.533 --> 00:03:51.620
The white matter 
is involved in communication,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.870
learning, memory, and emotions.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.284
Frequent marijuana use

00:03:56.284 --> 00:03:59.254
can disrupt the development 
of white matter tracts,

00:03:59.254 --> 00:04:03.438
and also affect the brain’s ability 
to grow new connections.

00:04:03.438 --> 00:04:08.091
This may damage long-term learning ability
and problem solving.

00:04:08.091 --> 00:04:11.482
For now, it’s unclear 
how severe this damage can be

00:04:11.482 --> 00:04:13.082
or whether it’s reversible.

00:04:13.082 --> 00:04:14.849
And even among young people,

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.889
the risk is higher the younger someone is—

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.515
much higher for a 15 year old 
than a 22 year old, for instance.

00:04:22.515 --> 00:04:27.112
Marijuana can also cause hallucinations 
or paranoid delusions.

00:04:27.112 --> 00:04:29.842
Known as marijuana-induced psychosis,

00:04:29.842 --> 00:04:33.845
these symptoms usually subside 
when a person stops using marijuana.

00:04:33.845 --> 00:04:37.284
But in rare cases, 
psychosis doesn’t subside,

00:04:37.284 --> 00:04:41.706
instead unmasking 
a persistent psychotic disorder.

00:04:41.706 --> 00:04:46.246
A family history of psychotic disorders, 
like schizophrenia,

00:04:46.246 --> 00:04:49.427
is the clearest, though not the only, 
risk factor for this effect.

00:04:49.427 --> 00:04:53.955
Marijuana-induced psychosis 
is also more common among young adults,

00:04:53.955 --> 00:04:56.469
though it’s worth noting 
that psychotic disorders

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:59.199
usually surface in this age range anyway.

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.093
What’s unclear in these cases 
is whether the psychotic disorder

00:05:03.093 --> 00:05:05.399
would have appeared 
without marijuana use—

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:07.989
whether marijuana use triggers it early,

00:05:07.989 --> 00:05:12.243
is a catalyst for a tipping point 
that wouldn’t have been crossed otherwise,

00:05:12.243 --> 00:05:15.964
or whether the reaction 
to marijuana is merely an indication

00:05:15.964 --> 00:05:18.174
of an underlying disorder.

00:05:18.174 --> 00:05:23.391
In all likelihood, marijuana’s role 
varies from person to person.

00:05:23.391 --> 00:05:25.941
At any age, as with many other drugs,

00:05:25.941 --> 00:05:27.238
the brain and body

00:05:27.238 --> 00:05:31.208
become less sensitive 
to marijuana after repeated uses,

00:05:31.208 --> 00:05:35.108
meaning it takes more 
to achieve the same effects.

00:05:35.108 --> 00:05:37.939
Fortunately, unlike many other drugs,

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:41.229
there’s no risk of fatal overdose 
from marijuana,

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:44.204
and even heavy use 
doesn’t lead to debilitating

00:05:44.204 --> 00:05:48.273
or life-threatening 
withdrawal symptoms if use stops.

00:05:48.273 --> 00:05:52.176
There are more subtle forms 
of marijuana withdrawal, though,

00:05:52.176 --> 00:05:56.851
including sleep disturbances, 
irritability, and depressed mood,

00:05:56.851 --> 00:06:00.661
which pass 
within a few weeks of stopping use.

00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:03.220
So is marijuana bad for your brain?

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.340
It depends who you are.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.858
But while some risk factors 
are easy to identify,

00:06:08.858 --> 00:06:11.128
others aren’t well understood—

00:06:11.128 --> 00:06:16.077
which means there’s still some possibility
of experiencing negative effects,

00:06:16.077 --> 00:06:19.777
even if you don’t have 
any of the known risk factors.
