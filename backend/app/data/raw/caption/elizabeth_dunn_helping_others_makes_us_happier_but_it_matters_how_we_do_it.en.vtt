00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.729
So, I have a pretty fun job,

00:00:15.753 --> 00:00:19.032
which is to figure out
what makes people happy.

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:24.311
It's so fun, it might almost seen
a little frivolous,

00:00:24.335 --> 00:00:26.770
especially at a time where
we're being confronted

00:00:26.794 --> 00:00:29.344
with some pretty depressing headlines.

00:00:30.087 --> 00:00:34.449
But it turns out that studying happiness
might provide a key

00:00:34.473 --> 00:00:38.366
to solving some of the toughest
problems we're facing.

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:42.953
It's taken me almost a decade
to figure this out.

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:45.216
Pretty early on in my career,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.536
I published a paper in "Science"
with my collaborators,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.741
entitled, "Spending Money
on Others Promotes Happiness."

00:00:52.377 --> 00:00:55.315
I was very confident in this conclusion,

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:57.375
except for one thing:

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.514
it didn't seem to apply to me.

00:01:00.538 --> 00:01:01.766
(Laughter)

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.092
I hardly ever gave money to charity,

00:01:04.116 --> 00:01:05.308
and when I did,

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:08.174
I didn't feel that warm glow
I was expecting.

00:01:08.723 --> 00:01:14.876
So I started to wonder if maybe
there was something wrong with my research

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.903
or something wrong with me.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.294
My own lackluster emotional response
to giving was especially puzzling

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:30.572
because my follow-up studies revealed
that even toddlers exhibited joy

00:01:30.596 --> 00:01:32.223
from giving to others.

00:01:32.803 --> 00:01:36.595
In one experiment, my colleagues
Kiley Hamlin, Lara Aknin and I

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.222
brought kids just under
the age of two into the lab.

00:01:40.246 --> 00:01:41.509
Now, as you might imagine,

00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:45.809
we had to work with a resource
that toddlers really care about,

00:01:45.833 --> 00:01:49.518
so we used the toddler equivalent of gold,

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:51.907
namely, Goldfish crackers.

00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:53.240
(Laughter)

00:01:53.264 --> 00:01:56.901
We gave kids this windfall
of Goldfish for themselves

00:01:56.925 --> 00:01:59.942
and a chance to give
some of their Goldfish away

00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:01.952
to a puppet named Monkey.

00:02:02.495 --> 00:02:04.625
(Video) Researcher: I found
even more treats,

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.934
and I'm going to give them all to you.

00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:09.793
Toddler: Ooh. Thank you.

00:02:10.712 --> 00:02:13.438
Researcher: But, you know,
I don't see any more treats.

00:02:13.462 --> 00:02:15.114
Will you give one to Monkey?

00:02:16.278 --> 00:02:17.898
Toddler: Yeah.
Researcher: Yeah?

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.181
Toddler: Yeah.

00:02:24.852 --> 00:02:26.008
Here.

00:02:26.032 --> 00:02:29.779
Researcher: Ooh, yummy. Mmmm.

00:02:30.862 --> 00:02:32.495
Toddler: All gone, he ate it.

00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:37.856
Elizabeth Dunn: Now, we trained
research assistants to watch these videos

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.435
and code toddlers' emotional reactions.

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.613
Of course, we didn't tell them
our hypotheses.

00:02:43.357 --> 00:02:46.169
The data revealed that toddlers
were pretty happy

00:02:46.193 --> 00:02:49.051
when they got this pile
of Goldfish for themselves,

00:02:49.075 --> 00:02:50.909
but they were actually even happier

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:53.786
when they got to give
some of their Goldfish away.

00:02:54.423 --> 00:02:58.841
And this warm glow of giving
persists into adulthood.

00:02:58.865 --> 00:03:03.110
When we analyzed surveys
from more than 200,000 adults

00:03:03.134 --> 00:03:04.687
across the globe,

00:03:04.711 --> 00:03:07.923
we saw that nearly a third
of the world's population

00:03:07.947 --> 00:03:11.871
reported giving at least some money
to charity in the past month.

00:03:12.535 --> 00:03:16.588
Remarkably, in every
major region of the world,

00:03:16.612 --> 00:03:21.161
people who gave money to charity
were happier than those who did not,

00:03:21.185 --> 00:03:25.010
even after taking into account
their own personal financial situation.

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.366
And this correlation wasn't trivial.

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:31.010
It looked like giving to charity

00:03:31.034 --> 00:03:33.456
made about the same
difference for happiness

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.143
as having twice as much income.

00:03:37.857 --> 00:03:39.944
Now, as a researcher,

00:03:39.968 --> 00:03:42.501
if you're lucky enough
to stumble on an effect

00:03:42.525 --> 00:03:46.637
that replicates around the world
in children and adults alike,

00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:48.510
you start to wonder:

00:03:48.534 --> 00:03:51.334
Could this be part of human nature?

00:03:51.848 --> 00:03:56.401
We know that pleasure
reinforces adaptive behaviors

00:03:56.425 --> 00:03:58.317
like eating and sex

00:03:58.341 --> 00:04:01.392
that help perpetuate our species,

00:04:01.416 --> 00:04:05.791
and it looked to me like giving
might be one of those behaviors.

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.441
I was really excited about these ideas,

00:04:09.465 --> 00:04:11.904
and I wrote about them
in the "New York Times."

00:04:12.457 --> 00:04:14.572
One of the people who read this article

00:04:14.596 --> 00:04:16.198
was my accountant.

00:04:16.222 --> 00:04:19.267
(Laughter)

00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:20.453
Yeah.

00:04:20.477 --> 00:04:24.527
At tax time, I found myself
seated across from him,

00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:27.511
watching as he slowly tapped his pen

00:04:27.535 --> 00:04:30.415
on the charitable giving line
of my tax return

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:32.456
with this look of, like,

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.877
poorly concealed disapproval.

00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:36.952
(Laughter)

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:41.852
Despite building my career
by showing how great giving can feel,

00:04:41.876 --> 00:04:45.410
I actually wasn't doing very much of it.

00:04:45.434 --> 00:04:48.025
So I resolved to give more.

00:04:48.944 --> 00:04:50.778
Around that time,

00:04:50.802 --> 00:04:54.536
devastating stories about
the Syrian refugee crisis

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.199
were everywhere.

00:04:56.826 --> 00:04:58.356
I really wanted to help,

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.178
so I pulled out my credit card.

00:05:01.202 --> 00:05:06.470
I knew my donations would probably
make a difference for someone somewhere,

00:05:06.494 --> 00:05:09.424
but going to the website
of an effective charity

00:05:09.448 --> 00:05:11.542
and entering my Visa number

00:05:11.566 --> 00:05:14.004
still just didn't feel like enough.

00:05:15.091 --> 00:05:18.732
That's when I learned
about the Group of Five.

00:05:19.717 --> 00:05:23.304
The Canadian government
allows any five Canadians

00:05:23.328 --> 00:05:26.420
to privately sponsor a family of refugees.

00:05:27.166 --> 00:05:29.933
You have to raise enough money
to support the family

00:05:29.957 --> 00:05:31.890
for their first year in Canada,

00:05:31.914 --> 00:05:35.590
and then they literally
get on a plane to your city.

00:05:36.608 --> 00:05:40.358
One of the things that I think
is so cool about this program

00:05:40.382 --> 00:05:42.843
is that no one is allowed to do it alone.

00:05:42.867 --> 00:05:45.078
And instead of a Group of Five,

00:05:45.102 --> 00:05:47.615
we ended up partnering
with a community organization

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.526
and forming a group of 25.

00:05:51.716 --> 00:05:55.487
After almost two years
of paperwork and waiting,

00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:58.205
we learned that our family
would be arriving in Vancouver

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.087
in less than six weeks.

00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:03.317
They had four sons and a daughter,

00:06:03.341 --> 00:06:06.262
so we raced to find them a place to live.

00:06:06.786 --> 00:06:09.271
We were very lucky to find them a house,

00:06:09.295 --> 00:06:10.984
but it needed quite a bit of work.

00:06:11.008 --> 00:06:13.956
So my friends came out
on evenings and weekends

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.299
and painted and cleaned
and assembled furniture.

00:06:17.807 --> 00:06:19.465
When the big day came,

00:06:19.489 --> 00:06:22.895
we filled their fridge
with milk and fresh fruit

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:26.399
and headed to the airport
to meet our family.

00:06:26.423 --> 00:06:30.188
It was a little overwhelming for everyone,

00:06:30.212 --> 00:06:32.129
especially the four-year-old.

00:06:32.646 --> 00:06:35.573
His mother was reunited with her sister

00:06:35.597 --> 00:06:38.652
who had come to Canada earlier
through the same program.

00:06:39.074 --> 00:06:42.591
They hadn't seen each other in 15 years.

00:06:43.952 --> 00:06:50.370
When you hear that more than
5.6 million refugees have fled Syria,

00:06:50.394 --> 00:06:52.407
you're faced with this tragedy

00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:57.141
that the human brain hasn't really
evolved to comprehend.

00:06:57.165 --> 00:06:59.158
It's so abstract.

00:07:00.746 --> 00:07:03.935
Before, if any of us had been asked
to donate 15 hours a month

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:06.534
to help out with the refugee crisis,

00:07:06.558 --> 00:07:08.648
we probably would have said no.

00:07:09.545 --> 00:07:13.046
But as soon as we took our family
to their new home in Vancouver,

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.441
we all had the same realization:

00:07:15.465 --> 00:07:19.109
we were just going to do whatever it took
to help them be happy.

00:07:19.743 --> 00:07:25.525
This experience made me think
a little more deeply about my research.

00:07:25.972 --> 00:07:27.272
Back in my lab,

00:07:27.296 --> 00:07:30.088
we'd seen the benefits of giving spike

00:07:30.112 --> 00:07:34.088
when people felt a real sense
of connection with those they were helping

00:07:34.112 --> 00:07:36.827
and could easily envision
the difference they were making

00:07:36.851 --> 00:07:38.388
in those individuals' lives.

00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:41.204
For example, in one experiment,

00:07:41.228 --> 00:07:44.139
we gave participants an opportunity
to donate a bit of money

00:07:44.163 --> 00:07:46.751
to either UNICEF or Spread the Net.

00:07:46.775 --> 00:07:49.047
We chose these charities intentionally,

00:07:49.071 --> 00:07:52.922
because they were partners and shared
the same critically important goal

00:07:52.946 --> 00:07:54.488
of promoting children's health.

00:07:55.798 --> 00:08:00.440
But I think UNICEF is just
such a big, broad charity

00:08:00.464 --> 00:08:02.447
that it can be a little hard to envision

00:08:02.471 --> 00:08:05.701
how your own small donation
will make a difference.

00:08:06.245 --> 00:08:11.267
In contrast, Spread the Net
offers donors a concrete promise:

00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:12.896
for every 10 dollars donated,

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.589
they provide one bed net
to protect a child from malaria.

00:08:17.368 --> 00:08:20.849
We saw that the more money
people gave to Spread the Net,

00:08:20.873 --> 00:08:23.915
the happier they reported
feeling afterward.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.870
In contrast, this emotional
return on investment

00:08:28.894 --> 00:08:33.379
was completely eliminated
when people gave money to UNICEF.

00:08:33.994 --> 00:08:38.081
So this suggests that just
giving money to a worthwhile charity

00:08:38.105 --> 00:08:39.594
isn't always enough.

00:08:39.997 --> 00:08:42.126
You need to be able to envision

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.795
how, exactly, your dollars
are going to make a difference.

00:08:46.524 --> 00:08:51.282
Of course, the Group of Five program
takes this idea to a whole new level.

00:08:51.678 --> 00:08:53.401
When we first took on this project,

00:08:53.425 --> 00:08:56.667
we would talk about when
the refugees would arrive.

00:08:57.158 --> 00:09:00.606
Now, we just refer to them as our family.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.222
Recently, we took the kids ice skating,

00:09:03.246 --> 00:09:07.467
and later that day,
my six-year-old, Oliver, asked me,

00:09:07.491 --> 00:09:10.227
"Mommy, who is the oldest
kid in our family?"

00:09:10.908 --> 00:09:14.532
I assumed he was talking
about his plethora of cousins,

00:09:14.556 --> 00:09:16.556
and he was talking about them,

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.094
but also about our Syrian family.

00:09:19.832 --> 00:09:21.673
Since our family arrived,

00:09:21.697 --> 00:09:25.857
so many people and organizations
have offered to help,

00:09:25.881 --> 00:09:29.426
providing everything
from free dental fillings

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.455
to summer camps.

00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:36.222
It's made me see the goodness
that exists in our community.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.577
Thanks to one donation,

00:09:38.601 --> 00:09:41.389
the kids got to go to bike camp,

00:09:41.413 --> 00:09:42.911
and every day of the week,

00:09:42.935 --> 00:09:46.027
some member of our group
tried to be there to cheer for them.

00:09:46.591 --> 00:09:47.768
I happened to be there

00:09:47.792 --> 00:09:50.346
the day the training wheels
were supposed to come off,

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:54.335
and let me tell you, the four-year-old
did not think this was a good idea.

00:09:55.483 --> 00:09:57.577
So I went over and talked to him

00:09:57.601 --> 00:10:01.228
about the long-term benefits
of riding without training wheels.

00:10:01.252 --> 00:10:03.690
(Laughter)

00:10:03.714 --> 00:10:07.617
Then I remembered that he was four
and barely spoke English.

00:10:07.641 --> 00:10:11.658
So I reverted to two words
he definitely knew:

00:10:11.682 --> 00:10:12.877
ice cream.

00:10:13.535 --> 00:10:17.022
You try without training wheels,
I'll buy you ice cream.

00:10:17.046 --> 00:10:18.677
Here's what happened next.

00:10:19.565 --> 00:10:22.306
(Video) ED: Yes. Yeah!

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.481
Kid: I'm gonna try.

00:10:23.505 --> 00:10:25.382
ED: Oh my God! Look at you go!

00:10:25.406 --> 00:10:28.297
(Squealing) Look at you go!
You're doing it all by yourself!

00:10:28.321 --> 00:10:29.526
(Audience) (Laughter)

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.654
(Video) ED: Good job!

00:10:32.142 --> 00:10:33.679
(Audience) (Laughter)

00:10:33.703 --> 00:10:38.162
(Applause)

00:10:38.186 --> 00:10:44.087
ED: So this is the kind of helping
that human beings evolved to enjoy,

00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:46.022
but for 40 years,

00:10:46.046 --> 00:10:48.493
Canada was the only country in the world

00:10:48.517 --> 00:10:51.977
that allowed private citizens
to sponsor refugees.

00:10:52.565 --> 00:10:54.749
Now -- Canada!

00:10:54.773 --> 00:10:56.933
(Applause)

00:10:56.957 --> 00:10:58.273
It's pretty great.

00:10:59.354 --> 00:11:02.900
Now Australia and the UK
are starting up similar programs.

00:11:03.613 --> 00:11:07.116
Just imagine how different
the refugee crisis could look

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.599
if more countries made this possible.

00:11:10.647 --> 00:11:14.628
Creating these kinds of meaningful
connections between individuals

00:11:14.652 --> 00:11:17.519
provides an opportunity
to deal with challenges

00:11:17.543 --> 00:11:19.667
that feel overwhelming.

00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:25.358
One of those challenges lies just blocks
from where I'm standing right now,

00:11:25.382 --> 00:11:27.986
in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:32.338
By some measures, it's the poorest
urban postal code in Canada.

00:11:32.854 --> 00:11:35.939
We actually debated whether
to bring over a family of refugees,

00:11:35.963 --> 00:11:39.615
because there are so many people
right here already struggling.

00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:42.323
My friend Evan told me
that when he was a kid

00:11:42.347 --> 00:11:44.616
and his parents drove
through this neighborhood,

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.157
he would duck down in the back seat.

00:11:48.077 --> 00:11:50.614
But Evan's parents
never would have guessed

00:11:50.638 --> 00:11:52.255
that when he grew up,

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:54.980
he would open up the doors
of a local restaurant

00:11:55.004 --> 00:11:59.319
and invite this community inside
to enjoy three-course dinners.

00:11:59.997 --> 00:12:03.868
The program that Evan helped build
is called "Plenty of Plates,"

00:12:03.892 --> 00:12:06.309
and the goal is not just
to provide free meals

00:12:06.333 --> 00:12:08.359
but to create moments of connection

00:12:08.383 --> 00:12:11.779
between people who otherwise
might never make eye contact.

00:12:12.216 --> 00:12:15.296
Each night, a local business
sponsors the dinner

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.248
and sends a team of volunteers

00:12:17.272 --> 00:12:19.216
who help make and serve the meal.

00:12:19.732 --> 00:12:24.618
Afterward, the leftovers get distributed
to people who are out on the street,

00:12:24.642 --> 00:12:26.661
and importantly, there's enough money left

00:12:26.685 --> 00:12:29.205
to provide a thousand free lunches
for this community

00:12:29.229 --> 00:12:30.799
in the days that follow.

00:12:31.494 --> 00:12:35.094
But the benefits of this program
extend beyond food.

00:12:35.666 --> 00:12:40.323
For the volunteers, it provides
an opportunity to engage with people,

00:12:40.347 --> 00:12:43.256
to sit down and hear their stories.

00:12:43.733 --> 00:12:47.886
After this experience,
one volunteer changed his commute

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.789
so that instead of avoiding
this neighborhood,

00:12:50.813 --> 00:12:52.315
he walks through it,

00:12:52.339 --> 00:12:56.359
smiling or making eye contact
as he passes familiar faces.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:01.043
All of us are capable
of finding joy in giving.

00:13:01.551 --> 00:13:04.740
But we shouldn't expect this
to happen automatically.

00:13:05.359 --> 00:13:09.651
Spending money helping others
doesn't necessarily promote happiness.

00:13:09.675 --> 00:13:12.774
Instead, it matters how we do it.

00:13:13.223 --> 00:13:15.912
And if we want people to give more,

00:13:15.936 --> 00:13:20.062
we need to subvert the way we think
about charitable giving.

00:13:20.086 --> 00:13:22.621
We need to create opportunities to give

00:13:22.645 --> 00:13:26.102
that enable us to appreciate
our shared humanity.

00:13:26.737 --> 00:13:29.173
If any of you work for a charity,

00:13:29.197 --> 00:13:32.641
don't reward your donors
with pens or calendars.

00:13:33.959 --> 00:13:37.778
(Applause)

00:13:37.802 --> 00:13:39.679
Reward them with the opportunity

00:13:39.703 --> 00:13:43.963
to see the specific impact
that their generosity is having

00:13:43.987 --> 00:13:48.491
and to connect with the individuals
and communities they're helping.

00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:54.456
We're used to thinking about giving
as something we should do.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.813
And it is.

00:13:56.551 --> 00:13:59.109
But in thinking about it this way,

00:13:59.133 --> 00:14:03.892
we're missing out on one of
the best parts of being human:

00:14:03.916 --> 00:14:08.444
that we have evolved to find joy
in helping others.

00:14:09.041 --> 00:14:14.287
Let's stop thinking about giving
as just this moral obligation

00:14:14.311 --> 00:14:18.361
and start thinking of it
as a source of pleasure.

00:14:18.782 --> 00:14:19.976
Thank you.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.873
(Applause)
