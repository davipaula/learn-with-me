Corey Hajim: Hi, Chris, how are you?

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.309
Chris Anderson: I'm very well, Corey,

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.518
it's absolutely lovely to see you.

00:00:18.542 --> 00:00:20.184
CH: It's great to see you, too.

00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:21.559
(Laughter)

00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:26.851
CA: Somehow, you're always smiling,
no matter how dangerous, weird,

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:28.184
crazy things are.

00:00:28.208 --> 00:00:29.476
Thank you for that.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.184
CH: You don't see me
in the other room crying afterwards,

00:00:32.208 --> 00:00:34.559
but we'll leave that
for the other [unclear].

00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:37.684
So Chris, this is week three
of these conversations,

00:00:37.708 --> 00:00:41.833
how are you thinking about the people
we should be speaking with?

00:00:43.124 --> 00:00:45.601
CA: I mean, there are so many
aspects to this, right?

00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:47.893
There's understanding
the basic pandemic itself

00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:50.226
and all the science around that.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.976
There's the psychology
that we're all going through, the mindset.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.393
And we've had speakers
addressing both of these.

00:00:57.417 --> 00:00:58.893
And then I think increasingly,

00:00:58.917 --> 00:01:01.434
the conversation
is going to be "what now?"

00:01:01.458 --> 00:01:04.268
"How do we dig ourselves out of this?

00:01:04.292 --> 00:01:06.726
What's the way forward?"

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.559
And there's a couple of speakers
this week focused on that.

00:01:09.583 --> 00:01:11.476
And I think it's --

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.434
These conversations are incredibly rich,

00:01:13.458 --> 00:01:16.976
because I think one of the things

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.059
that people have got growing consensus on

00:01:19.083 --> 00:01:22.101
is that step one, we kind of get, right?

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:23.976
You shut things down,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.184
physically distance
in whatever way you can,

00:01:27.208 --> 00:01:30.059
different countries have gone about it
slightly differently,

00:01:30.083 --> 00:01:32.434
but basically that "flattens the curve,"

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:34.042
ultimately,

00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:38.518
the number of cases,
the number of infections slows down.

00:01:38.542 --> 00:01:40.643
And, but then what?

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:44.018
Because you can't go
back to life as normal,

00:01:44.042 --> 00:01:45.893
when you're living at home completely.

00:01:45.917 --> 00:01:47.934
You could do some things, but you can't.

00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:51.476
And so that's what
we're going to talk about today.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.059
CH: Right, it feels really hopeful
to talk about some actions we can take

00:01:57.083 --> 00:02:00.143
besides just staying away
from everybody else.

00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:04.059
So, well, I guess I'll pass it over to you
to introduce the speaker,

00:02:04.083 --> 00:02:06.101
and I will come back a little bit later

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.268
to share some questions from our audience.

00:02:08.292 --> 00:02:11.393
CA: Thanks so much, Corey,
see you again in a bit.

00:02:11.417 --> 00:02:12.684
CH: Thank you.

00:02:12.708 --> 00:02:15.476
CA: And yes, if you know anyone out there

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.726
who has just got stuck on,
"But how do people get back to work?"

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.601
"Where do we go from here?"

00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:26.351
Those are the people who you should,

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:28.809
maybe invite them
into this conversation right now,

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:31.643
because I think they're going to be
really interested.

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:34.601
Our speaker, our guest

00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:37.976
is a professor at Harvard, Danielle Allen.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.809
She runs, among other things,

00:02:40.833 --> 00:02:44.934
she runs an institute for ethics there,
the Safra institute.

00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:49.351
And fundamentally, she's thinking
about the ethical questions

00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:50.726
about what's happening here,

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.768
but she has pulled together
an extraordinary multidisciplinary team

00:02:54.792 --> 00:02:58.434
of economists, business leaders and others

00:02:58.458 --> 00:03:00.559
who have put together a plan,

00:03:00.583 --> 00:03:02.643
and I've been obsessed
with this whole thing

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:04.893
and how we find our way out.

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:09.809
This plan is as compelling a plan
as I've seen anywhere.

00:03:09.833 --> 00:03:12.684
So let's dig into it without further ado,

00:03:12.708 --> 00:03:15.792
Danielle Allen, welcome here
to TED Connects.

00:03:17.458 --> 00:03:19.851
Danielle Allen: Thank you, Chris,
happy to be here.

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:22.018
I'm really, really grateful
to have the chance

00:03:22.042 --> 00:03:24.476
to have this conversation with you.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.893
CA: It's -- It's so good,

00:03:26.917 --> 00:03:30.292
I just enjoyed our conversation
over the last couple of days.

00:03:31.375 --> 00:03:33.934
This is such a complex problem.

00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:37.018
What I kind of want you to do
is just go through it step-by-step,

00:03:37.042 --> 00:03:39.684
to see the logic

00:03:39.708 --> 00:03:42.309
of what it is that your team
are putting forward.

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:44.976
First of all --

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.393
Just the problem itself
of how we get the economy going again,

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:52.601
just talk a bit
about what's at stake there,

00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:54.768
because sometimes this is framed as

00:03:54.792 --> 00:03:56.809
"The economy? Who cares about the economy?

00:03:56.833 --> 00:03:58.434
People's lives are at stake.

00:03:58.458 --> 00:04:01.351
So let's just focus on that,
don't worry about the economy."

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:02.934
But it's not as simple as that.

00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.268
I mean, as an ethicist,

00:04:04.292 --> 00:04:07.250
what's at stake if we don't restart
the economy somehow?

00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:11.018
DA: Well we have to recognize
that we've actually faced

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.559
two existential threats simultaneously.

00:04:13.583 --> 00:04:15.851
The first was to the public health system.

00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:19.143
If the virus had been allowed
to unfold unimpeded,

00:04:19.167 --> 00:04:21.351
our public health systems
would have collapsed

00:04:21.375 --> 00:04:23.899
and that would have produced
a whole legitimacy crisis

00:04:23.923 --> 00:04:25.309
for our public institutions.

00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:27.476
So of course we shut down,
we had to do that,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.726
it was a necessary self-defense action

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.101
that has, however,
really devastated the economy.

00:04:33.125 --> 00:04:34.983
And that is also an existential threat,

00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:37.976
we can't actually endure a closed economy

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.143
over a duration of 12 to 18 months.

00:04:40.167 --> 00:04:42.018
Nor can we really endure a situation

00:04:42.042 --> 00:04:45.309
where we don't know whether we might have
another two to three months

00:04:45.333 --> 00:04:46.893
of extensive social distancing.

00:04:46.917 --> 00:04:49.351
So we really need an integrated strategy,

00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:51.934
one that recognizes
both of these existential threats

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.893
and finds a way to control the disease

00:04:53.917 --> 00:04:56.726
at the same that we can keep
the economy open.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.184
We call that combination
of controlling the disease

00:04:59.208 --> 00:05:00.684
while keeping the economy open

00:05:00.708 --> 00:05:01.976
pandemic resilience.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.893
We think that's what
we should be aiming for.

00:05:04.917 --> 00:05:06.351
CA: So people who aren't moved

00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:09.309
by the notion of the economy,
capitalism, whatever,

00:05:09.333 --> 00:05:12.643
think instead about the millions
and millions of jobs that were lost,

00:05:12.667 --> 00:05:15.059
the people who are desperate
to make money.

00:05:15.083 --> 00:05:19.976
And I guess the lives that will be lost
unless we solve this problem.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.101
DA: Absolutely, the economy
is one of the foundational pillars

00:05:23.125 --> 00:05:26.393
for a healthy society
with opportunity and with justice.

00:05:26.417 --> 00:05:28.559
You can't have a just society either,

00:05:28.583 --> 00:05:31.684
if you haven't secured
a just and functioning economy

00:05:31.708 --> 00:05:33.893
that delivers well-being for people.

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:36.351
So all we have to do
is remember back to 2008,

00:05:36.375 --> 00:05:39.476
and think about the impacts
on things like suicide and depression

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.684
and so forth, that flowed
from that recession,

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:44.309
so the economy is a public health concern

00:05:44.333 --> 00:05:47.768
in the same way that the virus
is a public health concern.

00:05:47.792 --> 00:05:52.101
CA: OK, so talk about why
this is such an intractable problem.

00:05:52.125 --> 00:05:53.476
People isolate,

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.059
in many countries in the world now
you're starting to see the cases flatten

00:05:57.083 --> 00:05:58.667
and in many cases decrease.

00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:01.351
It looks like,

00:06:01.375 --> 00:06:05.268
whether it's happened now
in your country or not,

00:06:05.292 --> 00:06:06.934
that will happen sooner or later.

00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.893
So why isn't that problem solved,

00:06:08.917 --> 00:06:11.375
we've beaten the virus,
let's get back to work?

00:06:12.333 --> 00:06:13.643
DA: That's a great question

00:06:13.667 --> 00:06:16.976
and it really speaks to how new
the experience for us is

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.643
to encounter a novel virus.

00:06:18.667 --> 00:06:22.476
It just really hasn't happened
to our society in a very, very long time.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.059
So we are what's called
the susceptible population,

00:06:25.083 --> 00:06:28.434
meaning not any of us
at the beginning of this had immunity.

00:06:28.458 --> 00:06:31.893
We were all susceptible
to catching the disease.

00:06:31.917 --> 00:06:33.268
For a society to be safe,

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:35.434
it needs to have
what's called herd immunity.

00:06:35.458 --> 00:06:37.476
You could achieve that through vaccination

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.310
or through people getting the disease.

00:06:39.334 --> 00:06:43.143
But it takes 50 to 67 percent
of the population to get the disease

00:06:43.167 --> 00:06:45.851
in order to achieve
that level of protection.

00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:48.768
We don't expect a vaccine
anytime in the next 12 months,

00:06:48.792 --> 00:06:50.059
possibly 18 months,

00:06:50.083 --> 00:06:52.976
so we have to recognize
that that pathway is not open to us.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.684
And to get a sense of the magnitude

00:06:54.708 --> 00:06:58.185
of what it would mean to live through
the disease to get to herd immunity,

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:59.601
think about this:

00:06:59.625 --> 00:07:01.268
In Italy right now

00:07:01.292 --> 00:07:03.809
they estimate that about
15 percent of the population

00:07:03.833 --> 00:07:05.934
has probably been exposed to the disease.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.643
So you'd have to repeat
what Italy has done

00:07:08.667 --> 00:07:10.809
three or more times,

00:07:10.833 --> 00:07:13.101
to get to a place where
you can reasonably think

00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:14.476
that there's herd immunity.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.351
And I think you can see
that when you think of that picture,

00:07:17.375 --> 00:07:19.101
how destabilizing a process would be

00:07:19.125 --> 00:07:23.809
of just leaving things broadly open
without disease controls.

00:07:23.833 --> 00:07:27.643
So the real trick is whether or not
there's a substitute for social distancing

00:07:27.667 --> 00:07:29.792
as a method for controlling the disease.

00:07:30.708 --> 00:07:33.101
CA: Right. So Italy,
even with that 15 percent

00:07:33.125 --> 00:07:35.518
has suffered at least 15,000 deaths,

00:07:35.542 --> 00:07:38.559
some people argue that it's
underreported by 50 percent there,

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:40.559
it might be 30,000 deaths plus there,

00:07:40.583 --> 00:07:43.393
and as they come down the curve,
there will be more to come.

00:07:43.417 --> 00:07:47.684
Multiply that by five or six, say,
for the bigger population size of the US

00:07:47.708 --> 00:07:54.184
and the herd immunity idea per se
doesn't seem like a winning idea.

00:07:54.208 --> 00:07:55.809
I mean, it's a horrible idea.

00:07:55.833 --> 00:07:57.684
DA: It's a horrible idea, exactly.

00:07:57.708 --> 00:08:00.328
And we do have alternatives,
that's the important thing,

00:08:00.352 --> 00:08:03.393
we actually do have a way
of controlling the disease,

00:08:03.417 --> 00:08:06.059
minimizing loss of life
and reopening the economy,

00:08:06.083 --> 00:08:08.684
so that's the thing
we should all be focusing on.

00:08:08.708 --> 00:08:13.268
CA: And again, the initial problem is that
if you just let people start coming back,

00:08:13.292 --> 00:08:16.184
as soon as they gather again
in reasonable numbers,

00:08:16.208 --> 00:08:18.476
the risk is that this
highly infectious bug

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.476
just takes off again.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.768
DA: Exactly.

00:08:21.792 --> 00:08:24.101
CA: And so one scenario is that you have

00:08:24.125 --> 00:08:27.851
countries lurching from
a little bit of activity here

00:08:27.875 --> 00:08:30.934
and then suddenly it explodes again
and everyone has to retreat.

00:08:30.958 --> 00:08:33.601
That does not seem attractive,

00:08:33.625 --> 00:08:36.018
that also just doesn't work.

00:08:36.042 --> 00:08:37.309
DA: No, exactly.

00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:39.934
I mean, we described that
as a freeze in place strategy

00:08:39.958 --> 00:08:41.226
for dealing with this.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.643
That is you freeze
and you shut down all activity,

00:08:43.667 --> 00:08:46.184
and then that flattens the curve,
you open up again,

00:08:46.208 --> 00:08:49.309
then you have another peak,
you have to freeze again and so forth.

00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:51.518
So you have this repeated
process of freezing,

00:08:51.542 --> 00:08:54.309
which just does tremendous damage
to the economy over time.

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:55.976
I mean the upfront damage is huge,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.476
but then there's never space
to recover from it,

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.393
because of great deal of uncertainty

00:09:00.417 --> 00:09:04.184
and repeated applications
of economically ruinous social distancing.

00:09:04.208 --> 00:09:08.684
So I think you're really
pointing to the features of the disease

00:09:08.708 --> 00:09:11.559
that make this situation
a problem that it is.

00:09:11.583 --> 00:09:14.101
And there are really two
that people should focus on.

00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:15.851
One is the degree of infectiousness.

00:09:15.875 --> 00:09:18.018
This is a highly infectious virus.

00:09:18.042 --> 00:09:21.101
So the comparison to the Spanish flu
is a reasonable one

00:09:21.125 --> 00:09:24.018
from the point of view
of degree of infectiousness.

00:09:24.042 --> 00:09:26.684
Then the second really important
point about the disease

00:09:26.708 --> 00:09:29.184
is that it's possible
to be an asymptomatic carrier.

00:09:29.208 --> 00:09:31.309
That is to be infectious,
to carry the virus,

00:09:31.333 --> 00:09:33.434
and never show any symptoms yourself.

00:09:33.458 --> 00:09:35.309
Current estimates are still imprecise,

00:09:35.333 --> 00:09:39.893
but people think that about 20 percent
of virus carriers are asymptomatic.

00:09:39.917 --> 00:09:43.059
And that is really the thing
that makes it so hard to control.

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.559
People don't know they're sick

00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:46.351
and then they become disease vectors,

00:09:46.375 --> 00:09:47.958
spreading it everywhere they go.

00:09:48.875 --> 00:09:50.143
CA: Yes, indeed.

00:09:50.167 --> 00:09:53.268
So talk a bit, Danielle,
about your thinking

00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:56.208
about how we might outwit this thing.

00:09:57.333 --> 00:09:59.726
DA: So the alternative
to social distancing

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.809
as a strategy for controlling the disease

00:10:01.833 --> 00:10:06.684
is really massively ramped up,
massively scaled up testing,

00:10:06.708 --> 00:10:09.018
combined with individual quarantine.

00:10:09.042 --> 00:10:11.934
So we are going to continue
to need individual quarantine

00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.518
for those who are positive
carriers of the virus,

00:10:14.542 --> 00:10:17.851
until such a point
as we have gotten a vaccine.

00:10:17.875 --> 00:10:19.434
Now what does that mean exactly?

00:10:19.458 --> 00:10:24.268
It means that the standard quarantine
that aligns with the incubation period,

00:10:24.292 --> 00:10:26.268
14 days is often what people talk about,

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:27.726
in the conservative picture

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.059
you might say twice
the incubation period length,

00:10:30.083 --> 00:10:32.059
28 days for individual quarantine.

00:10:32.083 --> 00:10:34.809
And we need that quarantine
for people who are symptomatic

00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:37.268
and for asymptomatic
carriers of the virus.

00:10:37.292 --> 00:10:40.809
Now the only way that you can actually
run an individual quarantine

00:10:40.833 --> 00:10:43.559
as opposed to a collective
quarantine regime,

00:10:43.583 --> 00:10:46.434
is if you do massive testing.

00:10:46.458 --> 00:10:50.018
We really need to make testing
in a sense universally available,

00:10:50.042 --> 00:10:53.726
so that we can be testing
broadly across the population.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.893
There are ways to target test,
make it more efficient and so forth,

00:10:56.917 --> 00:10:58.976
but in principle, what one should imagine,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.434
is really wide-scale testing,

00:11:00.458 --> 00:11:02.143
tens of millions of tests a day,

00:11:02.167 --> 00:11:05.351
connected with quarantine
for those who test positive.

00:11:05.375 --> 00:11:06.667
(Coughs) Excuse me.

00:11:09.917 --> 00:11:11.184
CA: So weird.

00:11:11.208 --> 00:11:14.309
Anytime anyone coughs today,
you go, "Oh, God, are you OK?"

00:11:14.333 --> 00:11:15.684
DA: Yeah, no, no, I'm fine,

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:18.518
Frog in the throat, that's all it is.

00:11:18.542 --> 00:11:19.833
CA: (Laughs)

00:11:21.792 --> 00:11:23.934
So just to play out a thought experiment.

00:11:23.958 --> 00:11:27.184
If we had an infinite
number of tests available,

00:11:27.208 --> 00:11:31.893
and after the curve has flattened
and cases have gone down,

00:11:31.917 --> 00:11:33.351
everyone came back to work,

00:11:33.375 --> 00:11:36.250
but everyone was tested every day.

00:11:37.083 --> 00:11:41.851
Then what we think is
that the tests will show up positive

00:11:41.875 --> 00:11:43.143
at the same time,

00:11:43.167 --> 00:11:46.101
or possibly even ahead of the time
that people are infectious.

00:11:46.125 --> 00:11:48.143
But certainly, let's say at the same time,

00:11:48.167 --> 00:11:50.226
regardless of whether they're symptomatic.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.351
And so you could --

00:11:52.375 --> 00:11:55.143
Those people would
immediately go back home

00:11:55.167 --> 00:11:57.268
and the rest of the population
should be OK,

00:11:57.292 --> 00:11:58.976
we should be able to get work done,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.518
in that thought experiment, right?

00:12:01.542 --> 00:12:04.393
DA: Right, in that thought
experiment, exactly, yeah.

00:12:04.417 --> 00:12:05.684
CA: But the trouble is,

00:12:05.708 --> 00:12:10.143
that that would mean doing,
whatever, like, 200 million tests a day.

00:12:10.167 --> 00:12:11.976
DA: Right, exactly.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.184
CA: Which is many, many orders
of magnitude more than we have

00:12:15.208 --> 00:12:17.226
and could even imagine ramping up to.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.101
So you have a proposal,
and this is the ingenuity,

00:12:20.125 --> 00:12:21.393
the proposal,

00:12:21.417 --> 00:12:26.059
of how to potentially administer tests
in a way that's much more efficient.

00:12:26.083 --> 00:12:27.726
Talk a bit about that.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.018
DA: Sure.

00:12:29.042 --> 00:12:32.143
So if you were going to use
a purely random testing method

00:12:32.167 --> 00:12:33.434
to control the disease,

00:12:33.458 --> 00:12:36.268
you could probably actually get away
with testing everybody

00:12:36.292 --> 00:12:37.851
every two or three days --

00:12:37.875 --> 00:12:40.476
I'm playing along
with your thought experiment here --

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.018
and bring the number down
to 100 million tests a day.

00:12:43.042 --> 00:12:44.559
But even that is a magnitude

00:12:44.583 --> 00:12:46.768
that would take us
multiple months to get to,

00:12:46.792 --> 00:12:49.893
let's just say if we even wanted
to try to do something like that.

00:12:49.917 --> 00:12:52.893
So the thing that you really need
is smart testing.

00:12:52.917 --> 00:12:55.184
So rather than testing
the population at random,

00:12:55.208 --> 00:12:57.893
what you do is you use testing

00:12:57.917 --> 00:12:59.768
to identify people who are positive,

00:12:59.792 --> 00:13:04.018
and then you add to that
contact tracing or contact warning,

00:13:04.042 --> 00:13:05.893
we think about it in both ways.

00:13:05.917 --> 00:13:09.726
And what this means is
that once you know who's a positive test,

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.434
you figure out who else
has been exposed to that person

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:13.851
over the previous two weeks,

00:13:13.875 --> 00:13:15.476
and they all get tested as well.

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.518
So you start to identify a class of people

00:13:17.542 --> 00:13:20.393
who are a higher probability
of being infectious

00:13:20.417 --> 00:13:22.101
and you test that group of people.

00:13:22.125 --> 00:13:24.601
So you move away from random testing,

00:13:24.625 --> 00:13:28.018
you target it through contact tracing
or contact warning.

00:13:28.042 --> 00:13:30.851
And then, depending
on the level of effectiveness

00:13:30.875 --> 00:13:34.518
of your contact-tracing
and contact-warning strategy,

00:13:34.542 --> 00:13:35.976
you can reduce the numbers.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.518
So on a moderately effective
contact-tracing regimen,

00:13:39.542 --> 00:13:42.268
you could imagine doing
20 million tests a day.

00:13:42.292 --> 00:13:46.893
On a highly effective regime
of contact tracing and warning,

00:13:46.917 --> 00:13:50.500
you could get yourself down to the order
of five to 10 million tests a day.

00:13:51.458 --> 00:13:54.934
CA: And some countries in Asia
seem to have pulled off

00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:59.309
a version of this strategy
that has been effective.

00:13:59.333 --> 00:14:02.809
But it requires one of two things,
if I understand you right, Danielle,

00:14:02.833 --> 00:14:05.684
it requires either
just this massively scaled up,

00:14:05.708 --> 00:14:10.351
or potentially quite intrusive
sort of manual contact tracing

00:14:10.375 --> 00:14:12.851
where you have big teams
who swoop in to anyone

00:14:12.875 --> 00:14:14.476
who's tested positive

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:19.101
and try to unpack their complete
recent social history.

00:14:19.125 --> 00:14:21.976
Or technology plays a role,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.851
and this is where it gets complicated,

00:14:23.875 --> 00:14:27.059
because you know, there are apps
in some of the Asian countries,

00:14:27.083 --> 00:14:28.684
like, China has an app

00:14:28.708 --> 00:14:31.726
which most people are,
I think, required to carry,

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.809
certainly in Wuhan and elsewhere,

00:14:33.833 --> 00:14:37.726
where it's very good at predicting

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:40.726
whether someone may need quarantine.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.601
And they will be required to do so.

00:14:42.625 --> 00:14:45.518
And so there are all these concerns
about government control,

00:14:45.542 --> 00:14:46.958
government intrusion.

00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:53.393
You are in discussion about ways
of doing some kind of technology

00:14:53.417 --> 00:14:56.143
that would be more acceptable
in a democracy,

00:14:56.167 --> 00:14:58.684
and I'd love you to share what those are.

00:14:58.708 --> 00:15:00.226
DA: Sure, I'm happy to do that.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:02.726
So I think it's an important
thing to say upfront

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.476
that the rates at which
we would need to test per capita

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.434
are higher, much higher
than Asian countries used,

00:15:09.458 --> 00:15:11.684
because prevalence is much higher here.

00:15:11.708 --> 00:15:12.976
They caught it earlier,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.018
they had these tools built
before the pandemic hit.

00:15:16.042 --> 00:15:17.309
As a consequence,

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:20.476
they're able to control it
with a lower per capita rate of testing

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.934
than will be the case for us.

00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.184
We just have to accept
that fact at this point

00:15:24.208 --> 00:15:27.476
and recognize that massively scaling up
is specific to our situation,

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.976
because we weren't ready before it hit.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.309
So then, yes, OK, if we're trying
to do the smart testing,

00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:35.351
trying to use tools, what can you do?

00:15:35.375 --> 00:15:38.852
So we're actually open to manual testing
in the plan that we've developed,

00:15:38.876 --> 00:15:40.143
I want to just say that,

00:15:40.167 --> 00:15:42.768
and I think that society,
we have a big choice to make,

00:15:42.792 --> 00:15:46.018
whether what we want is a big core
of manual contact tracers

00:15:46.042 --> 00:15:48.268
who are tracing people's histories

00:15:48.292 --> 00:15:50.643
and figuring out
who they've been in contact with

00:15:50.667 --> 00:15:52.191
and who they've been exposed to.

00:15:52.215 --> 00:15:54.643
Or if we want to try to use
a technological system.

00:15:54.667 --> 00:15:57.191
The important thing
is there is a diversity of options

00:15:57.215 --> 00:15:58.559
within the technology space.

00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:02.476
So it's really important to recognize
that places like Singapore and China

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.309
have used highly centralized
data systems for supporting this.

00:16:06.333 --> 00:16:10.268
And so what happens is,
sort of, you carry your phone around,

00:16:10.292 --> 00:16:12.768
and everybody is connected
to a central data system,

00:16:12.792 --> 00:16:15.476
and then when somebody in the system
has a positive test,

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:16.851
that gets put into the app,

00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:19.161
and then their phone
communicates to other phones

00:16:19.185 --> 00:16:22.059
that it's been in proximity with
over the previous two weeks,

00:16:22.083 --> 00:16:24.893
to alert people that they too
need to get a test, OK?

00:16:24.917 --> 00:16:26.184
That's the basic concept.

00:16:26.208 --> 00:16:27.893
In China and Singapore

00:16:27.917 --> 00:16:31.184
the data structure for doing this
is highly centralized.

00:16:31.208 --> 00:16:33.684
There are, however,
a lot of innovative apps

00:16:33.708 --> 00:16:35.351
under development right now

00:16:35.375 --> 00:16:39.684
that depend instead on a very
privacy-protective structure

00:16:39.708 --> 00:16:42.268
where the data lives
on the individual user's phone

00:16:42.292 --> 00:16:44.976
and through a combination
of encryption and tokens

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.143
users of phones can communicate
with other users of phones,

00:16:48.167 --> 00:16:49.934
but the data is not centralized.

00:16:49.958 --> 00:16:53.018
So in that regard, it becomes
more of a peer-to-peer sharing,

00:16:53.042 --> 00:16:55.143
sort of concept of friends warn friends

00:16:55.167 --> 00:16:57.934
that they should probably go get tested.

00:16:57.958 --> 00:17:01.393
Then you would have
a central repository of test data,

00:17:01.417 --> 00:17:03.559
but the truth is, we already have that,

00:17:03.583 --> 00:17:05.601
because all influenza tests for example,

00:17:05.625 --> 00:17:08.309
already roll up into CDC

00:17:08.333 --> 00:17:10.351
and Health and Human Services databases,

00:17:10.375 --> 00:17:13.184
so that they can track
influenza patterns every year.

00:17:13.208 --> 00:17:15.809
CA: So tell me if I understand this right.

00:17:15.833 --> 00:17:18.934
You would carry on your phone an app

00:17:18.958 --> 00:17:23.184
that would, when you got,
say, within six feet

00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:25.518
of another human carrying that app,

00:17:25.542 --> 00:17:29.226
the phones would exchange a Bluetooth --
using Bluetooth technology

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.518
they exchange a kind of token

00:17:31.542 --> 00:17:33.101
that says, "Hi, we connected."

00:17:33.125 --> 00:17:34.417
But it's encrypted.

00:17:35.375 --> 00:17:38.393
And that is not communicated
to a central server,

00:17:38.417 --> 00:17:40.268
that is on the phone.

00:17:40.292 --> 00:17:43.059
But if either of you

00:17:43.083 --> 00:17:46.809
in the next week or two tests positive,

00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:49.851
your phone will be able
to communicate to all the people

00:17:49.875 --> 00:17:51.809
which it exchanged token with,

00:17:51.833 --> 00:17:56.393
to say, "Uh oh, someone who
you were close to in the last two weeks

00:17:56.417 --> 00:17:57.768
has tested positive.

00:17:57.792 --> 00:17:59.143
You've got to isolate."

00:17:59.167 --> 00:18:02.809
That's basically how it works,
it's done that way.

00:18:02.833 --> 00:18:04.101
DA: Exactly.

00:18:04.125 --> 00:18:06.851
CA: And then after, what,
three or four weeks,

00:18:06.875 --> 00:18:09.643
the tokens can actually autodelete?

00:18:09.667 --> 00:18:11.476
They go, they're not there anymore.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.018
DA: They expire, that's right.

00:18:13.042 --> 00:18:16.233
Because you only need the most
recent two weeks' information or data

00:18:16.257 --> 00:18:17.518
about where you've been

00:18:17.542 --> 00:18:20.059
and what other phones
your phone has interacted with.

00:18:20.083 --> 00:18:21.851
So that's the really key thing.

00:18:21.875 --> 00:18:25.226
CA: Alright, we'll come back
to that in a minute,

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.518
but let's see what our friends
are asking online.

00:18:28.542 --> 00:18:29.809
DA: OK.

00:18:29.833 --> 00:18:31.226
CH: Hi, Danielle, hi, Chris.

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:33.226
Yeah, we've got a lot of great questions,

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.875
people are super interested
in how this is all going to work.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:41.393
There's a couple of questions
I'm trying to cobble together here.

00:18:41.417 --> 00:18:44.726
I think people are really
interested in your thoughts

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:47.351
on the United States health care system.

00:18:47.375 --> 00:18:50.934
We have so many underinsured
and uninsured people

00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:54.809
and the changes that you might
make to that system,

00:18:54.833 --> 00:18:57.018
I mean, does that situation
make things worse,

00:18:57.042 --> 00:18:59.684
and what changes
would you make to the system

00:18:59.708 --> 00:19:02.500
so that we're not
as vulnerable in the future?

00:19:03.576 --> 00:19:05.434
DA: So that's a great set of questions,

00:19:05.458 --> 00:19:09.684
and so just from the point of view
of the testing program,

00:19:09.708 --> 00:19:13.226
it is absolutely critical
that the testing be free.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.184
And so there is absolutely,

00:19:15.208 --> 00:19:16.976
a sort of necessary feature of this,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.601
which is about, kind of, universal access
element to the health system.

00:19:21.625 --> 00:19:24.601
And so I'm sure there will be
tweaking that's necessary

00:19:24.625 --> 00:19:27.309
in the existing health system
to achieve that.

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:29.934
We've also without any question
seen vulnerabilities

00:19:29.958 --> 00:19:33.476
that relate to and stem from
our fragmented health system.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.548
So I think there's a much bigger,
longer-term question to be had,

00:19:36.572 --> 00:19:37.809
or conversation to have,

00:19:37.833 --> 00:19:40.268
about how we overcome that fragmentation.

00:19:40.292 --> 00:19:43.268
So yes, I do hope
this moment will be a spur

00:19:43.292 --> 00:19:47.018
for that longer-term conversation
about improving our health system

00:19:47.042 --> 00:19:51.042
and really achieving that universal
coverage that we so badly need.

00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:55.226
CH: OK, thank you, I'll see you
both again in a little bit.

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:56.500
CA: Thanks, Corey.

00:19:57.542 --> 00:20:02.143
So let's stay with this
tech issue for a bit.

00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:05.018
And the sort of civil rights
or privacy questions

00:20:05.042 --> 00:20:09.684
that it might still raise in some people.

00:20:09.708 --> 00:20:12.309
So one concern is that

00:20:12.333 --> 00:20:17.059
surely, if your phone is able
to contact these other phones,

00:20:17.083 --> 00:20:19.684
someone somewhere
is ultimately going to reverse that

00:20:19.708 --> 00:20:23.184
and we'll have some kind
of record of your,

00:20:23.208 --> 00:20:25.768
you know, everyone who
you've connected with,

00:20:25.792 --> 00:20:29.018
and that might be concerning to some.

00:20:29.042 --> 00:20:31.143
Is that a legitimate concern?

00:20:31.167 --> 00:20:34.726
DA: I think it is, I mean, I think
we've been working hard on this question

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:36.559
and really trying to think it through

00:20:36.583 --> 00:20:40.155
and when you talk to legal experts
and civil liberties experts and so forth,

00:20:40.179 --> 00:20:42.059
everybody starts with the same premise:

00:20:42.083 --> 00:20:43.351
assume failure.

00:20:43.375 --> 00:20:45.268
Assume that you'll have a data breach.

00:20:45.292 --> 00:20:46.559
Think for that

00:20:46.583 --> 00:20:49.018
and what kind of protection
you want in that regard.

00:20:49.042 --> 00:20:50.934
And so when you think that way,

00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:54.268
you of course are trying to minimize
any likelihood of that happening,

00:20:54.292 --> 00:20:57.976
so hence the privacy-protective structure
of phones communicating with phones,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.226
data living on the hardware of the phone,

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:03.809
not in the server, etc.

00:21:03.833 --> 00:21:05.226
And then also you would want

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:07.476
a kind of democratic
accountability feature,

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.643
so for example having the Department
of Health and Human Services

00:21:10.667 --> 00:21:15.518
have an auditing function
to audit whoever is manning the server

00:21:15.542 --> 00:21:17.851
or controls the server

00:21:17.875 --> 00:21:19.726
through which the tokens are exchanged

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.809
you would want to audit
their functionality

00:21:21.833 --> 00:21:23.393
and how they're using the data.

00:21:23.417 --> 00:21:25.226
But then again, you presume failure,

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.893
that somebody's reverse engineering,
the audit system fails in some fashion.

00:21:28.917 --> 00:21:30.309
What's your protection then?

00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:33.059
The answer to that would appear to be
upfront legislation

00:21:33.083 --> 00:21:36.809
that prohibits the commercialization
of this COVID testing data.

00:21:36.833 --> 00:21:39.518
So that anybody who in any way
tried to commercialize it

00:21:39.542 --> 00:21:40.809
in any kind of way,

00:21:40.833 --> 00:21:43.226
would be subject to legal penalty.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:45.726
So I think that's how
you build the fence up upfront

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:49.476
in the expectation that somebody
would find the way to crack it.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.434
CA: And then there's a set of questions

00:21:51.458 --> 00:21:54.393
around how you get this app
out there at scale,

00:21:54.417 --> 00:21:56.434
because it's only effective if,

00:21:56.458 --> 00:22:00.476
say, two thirds of the people
who are working are carrying it, right,

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.934
something like that.

00:22:01.958 --> 00:22:03.226
DA: Right.

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:08.434
CA: And so short of authoritarian
"everyone must have this app,"

00:22:08.458 --> 00:22:10.518
I guess there are ways
that are interesting

00:22:10.542 --> 00:22:12.934
to say to people, one,
this is a really useful app,

00:22:12.958 --> 00:22:16.143
it will alert you quickly
if you're at any risk.

00:22:16.167 --> 00:22:17.559
But two,

00:22:17.583 --> 00:22:19.893
to get to the kind of scale
we're talking about,

00:22:19.917 --> 00:22:21.518
you might have to say to people,

00:22:21.542 --> 00:22:23.809
"Look, we're slowly
going to come back to work,

00:22:23.833 --> 00:22:25.851
industry by industry, company by company,

00:22:25.875 --> 00:22:29.184
and the deal for you to come back
and break isolation,

00:22:29.208 --> 00:22:30.809
the societal deal,

00:22:30.833 --> 00:22:34.393
is that you have to be willing
to carry this app."

00:22:34.417 --> 00:22:36.934
And you could, for people
who didn't want to do that,

00:22:36.958 --> 00:22:38.851
I guess you could have some protection,

00:22:38.875 --> 00:22:40.809
you can't lose your job for that.

00:22:40.833 --> 00:22:43.393
But, I mean, can you picture
society making the choice

00:22:43.417 --> 00:22:48.268
that it is reasonable to require people
who want to come back to work

00:22:48.292 --> 00:22:51.583
to carry that alert technology with them?

00:22:52.417 --> 00:22:54.393
DA: So this is the hardest question.

00:22:54.417 --> 00:22:56.809
We know we don't want
an authoritarian model,

00:22:56.833 --> 00:22:59.684
such as the one used
in China and Singapore,

00:22:59.708 --> 00:23:02.684
so we have to figure out instead
how to activate that thing,

00:23:02.708 --> 00:23:05.934
which is sort of the most important
democratic resource or asset,

00:23:05.958 --> 00:23:07.559
namely solidarity.

00:23:07.583 --> 00:23:10.143
So what is it that,
from a solidarity perspective,

00:23:10.167 --> 00:23:12.450
it's reasonable for us 
to ask of each other?

00:23:12.458 --> 00:23:15.643
That has to be the frame
for deciding how we approach this.

00:23:15.667 --> 00:23:17.184
And so one aspect of this

00:23:17.208 --> 00:23:21.268
is really, truly the building a culture
of opting in to this.

00:23:21.292 --> 00:23:22.769
And there are examples of this.

00:23:22.793 --> 00:23:26.476
So for example, New York
has tackled HIV testing

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.976
through a program that goes
by the label "New York Knows,"

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.059
and it started out with labels
of "Manhattan Knows" or "Brooklyn Knows,"

00:23:35.083 --> 00:23:37.226
and so forth, of the different burrows.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.518
And what this program is

00:23:38.542 --> 00:23:41.018
is one that is owned
by community organizations,

00:23:41.042 --> 00:23:42.559
community partners,

00:23:42.583 --> 00:23:44.726
that do the job of spreading the word

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.184
and recruiting people
into testing programs.

00:23:47.208 --> 00:23:49.976
And New York has the goal
of having every single New Yorker

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.643
be tested for HIV,

00:23:51.667 --> 00:23:54.726
so in other words,
it's established as an expectation,

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.559
that universal participation,

00:23:56.583 --> 00:24:00.184
and it's activated a network
of community partners and organizations,

00:24:00.208 --> 00:24:02.643
to cultivate that commitment
to solidarity.

00:24:02.667 --> 00:24:04.184
And so I think, in all honesty,

00:24:04.208 --> 00:24:07.518
that that would be a really huge part
of what you would need to do

00:24:07.542 --> 00:24:09.268
in order to tap into solidarity,

00:24:09.292 --> 00:24:11.351
to have this work.

00:24:11.375 --> 00:24:16.018
I'm sure that we would see some amount
of requiring in different context,

00:24:16.042 --> 00:24:17.559
I think that's a very hard one,

00:24:17.583 --> 00:24:21.059
because you don't want to generate
labor discrimination problems.

00:24:21.083 --> 00:24:22.351
And so the model there,

00:24:22.375 --> 00:24:25.434
to think about and to sort of figure out
what are our parameters,

00:24:25.458 --> 00:24:26.726
what we think is fair,

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:28.851
connects to things
that schools currently do,

00:24:28.875 --> 00:24:33.101
for example, when they require
that students show vaccination proof

00:24:33.125 --> 00:24:35.934
before they can start the school year
and things like that.

00:24:35.958 --> 00:24:39.518
So there are multiple states
that do that in schools for vaccines.

00:24:39.542 --> 00:24:41.226
Would schools do the same thing,

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:43.934
what's the sort of labor,
the workforce question like,

00:24:43.958 --> 00:24:46.393
I think that very much remains
to be worked through,

00:24:46.417 --> 00:24:48.643
but it's a hugely important question.

00:24:48.667 --> 00:24:51.684
CA: I'd be curious what
the watching audience thinks about this,

00:24:51.708 --> 00:24:53.559
maybe you could enter a comment on it.

00:24:53.583 --> 00:24:57.226
But I mean, is it reasonable,
in the world that we're in right now,

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:59.143
for a company, let's say, to say,

00:24:59.167 --> 00:25:01.309
"Look, we want to get back to work,

00:25:01.333 --> 00:25:04.309
but we want to do so and respect
the safety of all our workers.

00:25:04.333 --> 00:25:06.434
That means that for you
to come back to work,

00:25:06.458 --> 00:25:08.684
you need a test
showing that you're negative.

00:25:08.708 --> 00:25:12.476
And you need to carry this app

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:15.934
so that we alert people quickly
if there's a problem."

00:25:15.958 --> 00:25:17.643
Is that --

00:25:17.667 --> 00:25:19.684
"We won't fire you if you don't come in,

00:25:19.708 --> 00:25:21.518
but if you want to come back to work,

00:25:21.542 --> 00:25:23.393
that's what you'll have to agree to."

00:25:23.417 --> 00:25:25.518
Is that a reasonable chance?

00:25:25.542 --> 00:25:27.542
I'm curious what people think.

00:25:28.375 --> 00:25:30.393
Is there any other way to get --

00:25:30.417 --> 00:25:31.934
Sorry.

00:25:31.958 --> 00:25:35.018
DA: I mean, again,
there is precedent for this

00:25:35.042 --> 00:25:37.726
in the sense that drug testing
works this way

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:39.684
in many employment contexts, right.

00:25:39.708 --> 00:25:43.309
There are many roles where people
have to do routine drug tests

00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:47.059
as a part of preserving their job.

00:25:47.083 --> 00:25:49.434
That was a hotly
debated issue in the 1980s,

00:25:49.458 --> 00:25:52.184
people sort of think back
when that sort of first came in,

00:25:52.208 --> 00:25:54.113
and there was a lot of concern about it.

00:25:54.137 --> 00:25:56.643
We have managed to develop
a regime for that,

00:25:56.667 --> 00:25:59.351
that has achieved
an equilibrium of a kind.

00:25:59.375 --> 00:26:02.476
So I imagine that something
is possible in this space,

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.934
but we would have to draw on
the prior experience

00:26:04.958 --> 00:26:07.667
with things like drug testing
in the workplace, I think.

00:26:08.958 --> 00:26:10.684
CA: I mean, one problem that we face

00:26:10.708 --> 00:26:13.018
when you think about these
big systems introduced

00:26:13.042 --> 00:26:15.809
is that in the past, there's history

00:26:15.833 --> 00:26:18.059
where something got introduced,

00:26:18.083 --> 00:26:21.559
you think of the PATRIOT Act
that came in after 9/11

00:26:21.583 --> 00:26:24.893
and a lot of people
have a lot of problems with that Act,

00:26:24.917 --> 00:26:27.184
and it gets renewed
relentlessly, relentlessly,

00:26:27.208 --> 00:26:29.268
and here we are, nearly 20 years later,

00:26:29.292 --> 00:26:32.018
and it's still with us.

00:26:32.042 --> 00:26:35.184
So that creates quite a high bar

00:26:35.208 --> 00:26:38.518
for any standard that we push out here.

00:26:38.542 --> 00:26:41.101
How do we persuade people

00:26:41.125 --> 00:26:45.226
that this is custom-made
for the current situation that we're in,

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:48.018
and it's not going to be picked up
and subsequently abused

00:26:48.042 --> 00:26:50.393
by companies or by government?

00:26:50.417 --> 00:26:52.476
DA: That's an absolutely
critical question,

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.893
and I think we have a lot to learn
from places like Germany,

00:26:55.917 --> 00:27:00.143
which are really, really strong
and rigorous on privacy protections.

00:27:00.167 --> 00:27:04.393
Perhaps having some of the highest
privacy-protection standards in the world.

00:27:04.417 --> 00:27:06.851
And Germany, over the course
of the last few weeks,

00:27:06.875 --> 00:27:09.351
has articulated an approach
that definitely picks up

00:27:09.375 --> 00:27:10.726
several of these elements.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:14.059
So there are ways of building in
privacy structures

00:27:14.083 --> 00:27:17.434
that are meeting the standards
of the German privacy framework,

00:27:17.458 --> 00:27:20.726
and so I think for us, that's a really
important place to look to,

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:22.941
and learn from them
how they're structuring it,

00:27:22.965 --> 00:27:25.684
to achieve those privacy protections.

00:27:25.708 --> 00:27:28.559
CA: Danielle, you're an ethicist,
among other things,

00:27:28.583 --> 00:27:30.476
as well as a political theorist,

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.893
and is it, as you think about how
to apply ethical questions to this,

00:27:34.917 --> 00:27:38.684
is it inherent in a situation like this
that there are going to be trade-offs,

00:27:38.708 --> 00:27:43.018
that there is no "perfect solution"
that we just, you know --

00:27:43.042 --> 00:27:44.643
These things are fundamentally --

00:27:44.667 --> 00:27:48.518
You've got two goods that are
fundamentally in conflict with each other

00:27:48.542 --> 00:27:51.684
or if you like, avoidance of two evils
that are going to clash.

00:27:51.708 --> 00:27:56.184
And that we're not going to get away
sort of untainted to some extent,

00:27:56.208 --> 00:27:59.726
we just have to try and make
the least bad choice?

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:02.476
DA: It's a great question, and I think,

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:06.518
I tend to formulate things as being
about hard choices and judgments,

00:28:06.542 --> 00:28:08.226
rather than being about trade-offs.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:12.018
I think trade-offs often suggest
that you can precisely quantify

00:28:12.042 --> 00:28:15.726
this degree of monetizable harm
against that degree of monetizable harm,

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:19.643
and I think that's actually not
as helpful to us in this current moment,

00:28:19.667 --> 00:28:20.934
to be honest.

00:28:20.958 --> 00:28:23.226
So in effect, I think
the most important thing

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.768
is that we clarify our core values.

00:28:25.792 --> 00:28:27.893
And so the way
we've tried to articulate that

00:28:27.917 --> 00:28:31.059
is to say we have a fundamental value
in securing public health.

00:28:31.083 --> 00:28:32.601
We have a fundamental value

00:28:32.625 --> 00:28:35.184
in securing a functioning,
healthy economy.

00:28:35.208 --> 00:28:36.559
We have a fundamental value

00:28:36.583 --> 00:28:39.851
in securing civil liberties and justice
and constitutional democracy.

00:28:39.875 --> 00:28:43.018
And so then the question is,
given that set of fundamental values,

00:28:43.042 --> 00:28:44.684
what are the policy options

00:28:44.708 --> 00:28:47.351
that actually do secure
all of those things?

00:28:47.375 --> 00:28:49.518
So in that regard, at the end of the day,

00:28:49.542 --> 00:28:52.934
you know, there's a bunch of libertarians
in the group that we work on,

00:28:52.958 --> 00:28:54.893
and a lot of us come out very strongly,

00:28:54.917 --> 00:28:57.851
sort of, privacy protecting,
liberty protecting point of view.

00:28:57.875 --> 00:29:00.143
And so we're not here
to sacrifice those things.

00:29:00.167 --> 00:29:03.476
We're rather here to find a solution
that aligns with the values

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.143
that we bring in to this problem.

00:29:05.167 --> 00:29:07.643
So that's how we think
about the decision making.

00:29:07.667 --> 00:29:09.851
CA: Talk a bit more, actually,
about the group

00:29:09.875 --> 00:29:11.893
that you've pooled together over this.

00:29:11.917 --> 00:29:14.018
I know that there's
a TED speaker Paul Romer,

00:29:14.042 --> 00:29:17.351
an economist at Stanford,
who's, I think, a key member.

00:29:17.375 --> 00:29:19.684
Who else is in the group?

00:29:19.708 --> 00:29:21.309
DA: Well, Paul was a key member.

00:29:21.333 --> 00:29:25.226
I'm afraid we parted ways to some extent,
because he's advocating random testing,

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:28.768
so the sort of 100 million
tests a day direction,

00:29:28.792 --> 00:29:31.976
and he's not a fan
of the contact-tracing approach,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.851
so he does have, you know,

00:29:34.875 --> 00:29:38.143
he's sort of at one end
of a kind of libertarian spectrum on that

00:29:38.167 --> 00:29:41.976
and my view, however,
is that testing 100 million a day

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.934
is far more intrusive

00:29:43.958 --> 00:29:48.268
than smart testing supported
by privacy protective contact tracing.

00:29:48.292 --> 00:29:50.976
I also think it's really important
to throw into the mix

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.059
the fact that collective social distancing

00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:55.351
is a huge infringement
on our civil liberties.

00:29:55.375 --> 00:29:56.643
We keep forgetting that.

00:29:56.667 --> 00:30:00.059
The alternative is not
contact tracing versus nothing,

00:30:00.083 --> 00:30:02.976
it's contact tracing
versus social distancing.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.268
We can't go out,

00:30:04.292 --> 00:30:07.340
we can't form associations
where we get to be together in person,

00:30:07.364 --> 00:30:09.684
churchgoers can't go to church right now.

00:30:09.708 --> 00:30:13.393
You know, political parties
are having their conventions postponed.

00:30:13.417 --> 00:30:15.768
If that's not infringement
on our civil liberties,

00:30:15.792 --> 00:30:17.059
I don't know what is.

00:30:17.083 --> 00:30:18.393
So from my point of view,

00:30:18.417 --> 00:30:21.143
the civil liberties conversation
is one about the contrast

00:30:21.167 --> 00:30:24.518
between the kind of infringement
that is produced by social distancing

00:30:24.542 --> 00:30:29.143
versus the kind of
infringement or reshaping

00:30:29.167 --> 00:30:31.518
that would be imposed
by contact-tracing regime.

00:30:31.542 --> 00:30:33.726
I didn't answer your question
about our group.

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:37.268
CA: Go ahead, it's just amazing
this thing is moving so fast in real time.

00:30:37.292 --> 00:30:40.143
Talk about some of the other people
who are in your group.

00:30:40.167 --> 00:30:44.351
DA: Sure, so Glen Weyl
is an economist at Microsoft,

00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:45.643
a political economist,

00:30:45.667 --> 00:30:46.934
he's a really key figure

00:30:46.958 --> 00:30:49.684
and he is really an innovative
mechanism design thinker,

00:30:49.708 --> 00:30:51.184
who is really good at kind of,

00:30:51.208 --> 00:30:54.601
figuring out how to craft
incentive structures and so forth

00:30:54.625 --> 00:30:59.934
that help people make choices
in socially productive ways,

00:30:59.958 --> 00:31:02.601
in ways that are also
freedom-respecting, and so forth.

00:31:02.625 --> 00:31:07.309
So he's really been helping us think
about the design of the policy pathway,

00:31:07.333 --> 00:31:09.684
Rajiv Sethi is another economist,

00:31:09.708 --> 00:31:12.059
Lucas Stanczyk is a philosopher at Harvard

00:31:12.083 --> 00:31:15.768
who has been scrutinizing
the civil liberties and justice questions.

00:31:15.792 --> 00:31:17.726
I mean, that is his line of work,

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.851
those are the things
he's most committed to,

00:31:19.875 --> 00:31:22.059
and that's what he's doing.

00:31:22.083 --> 00:31:24.601
We've reached out to a number
of public health groups

00:31:24.625 --> 00:31:25.893
for regular consultations,

00:31:25.917 --> 00:31:28.059
so they're not as directly
part of our group

00:31:28.083 --> 00:31:29.768
in the sense of advancing a policy,

00:31:29.792 --> 00:31:33.518
but in terms of informing
our epidemiological understanding,

00:31:33.542 --> 00:31:37.750
we've relied a lot on folks at the Chan
School of Public Health at Harvard.

00:31:38.708 --> 00:31:39.976
So lawyers as well,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.309
Glenn Cohen, who directs the Petrie-Flom
Center for law and bioethics

00:31:43.333 --> 00:31:44.893
has been a critical member,

00:31:44.917 --> 00:31:46.976
Andrew Crespo also at Harvard Law School,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.684
Rosa Brooks at Georgetown Law school,

00:31:49.708 --> 00:31:52.476
I could go on, I'm missing key people,
critical scientists.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.643
Actually, there's a great
paper on solidarity

00:31:54.667 --> 00:31:57.976
by Melani Cammett and Evan Lieberman
that people should check out too.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.809
CA: It's exciting that one
of the impacts of this,

00:32:00.833 --> 00:32:02.768
and I've seen it in other areas as well,

00:32:02.792 --> 00:32:06.393
this crisis is really breaking
a lot of cross-disciplinary lines

00:32:06.417 --> 00:32:09.101
and bringing people together
in unexpected combinations,

00:32:09.125 --> 00:32:10.393
which is good.

00:32:10.417 --> 00:32:11.684
DA: Yes.

00:32:11.708 --> 00:32:15.059
CA: So how, if this plan
got general acceptance, how --

00:32:15.083 --> 00:32:17.725
I mean, obviously,
the clock is ticking, this is urgent,

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:19.851
what would it look like
to move this forward?

00:32:19.876 --> 00:32:21.978
Give a sense of what
you think it would cost,

00:32:22.003 --> 00:32:24.601
give a sense of who might own it,

00:32:24.625 --> 00:32:29.893
like, what would it take
to actually activate this giant idea?

00:32:29.917 --> 00:32:33.203
DA: Alright, so it's a big price tag,
so I hope you're sitting down --

00:32:33.227 --> 00:32:34.726
I'm glad you're sitting down.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.768
So over two years,

00:32:36.792 --> 00:32:39.559
based on conservative estimates
of what you would need,

00:32:39.583 --> 00:32:43.143
that is to say maximal estimates
for testing and things like that,

00:32:43.167 --> 00:32:45.518
it's got a price tag of 500 billion,

00:32:45.542 --> 00:32:48.226
which includes both
the production of the tests

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:51.184
and the personnel of test administration,

00:32:51.208 --> 00:32:53.809
contact tracing and all of that.

00:32:53.833 --> 00:32:55.643
So it's important to remember though,

00:32:55.667 --> 00:32:58.559
that that production ramp up
and the contact tracing ramp up

00:32:58.583 --> 00:33:00.518
are employment possibilities,

00:33:00.542 --> 00:33:04.643
so in that regard, they would counteract
the negative impact on employment

00:33:04.667 --> 00:33:06.518
of the social distancing.

00:33:06.542 --> 00:33:07.809
So it's a big price tag,

00:33:07.833 --> 00:33:09.934
but it would be multipurpose
in that regard,

00:33:09.958 --> 00:33:11.816
contributing to jumping up the economy,

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:14.299
as well as the testing program itself.

00:33:15.125 --> 00:33:17.184
It would be important
that it be phased in,

00:33:17.208 --> 00:33:21.476
and phasing it in would actually give us
a way of testing out the paradigm

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.768
as we went.

00:33:22.792 --> 00:33:25.309
So for example,
for a first phase of rollout,

00:33:25.333 --> 00:33:27.018
probably what you would want to do,

00:33:27.042 --> 00:33:29.268
ideally by the end of the next month,

00:33:29.292 --> 00:33:31.976
would be to have a full range of testing

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.809
for a combination of everybody
in the health care sector

00:33:35.833 --> 00:33:38.018
and everybody who might fill in

00:33:38.042 --> 00:33:40.934
and substitute for any health care
workers who test positive.

00:33:40.958 --> 00:33:43.476
So in other words,
your health care worker pool

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.143
and a substitute pool,
say a national service corps,

00:33:46.167 --> 00:33:49.476
of folks who can fill in
for health care workers who test positive.

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:53.976
If you can get those two groups,
those two sectors

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.393
fully under testing,
contact-tracing regime,

00:33:56.417 --> 00:33:59.268
so you know that every
health care worker is not positive,

00:33:59.292 --> 00:34:02.059
and anybody who is is immediately
quarantined and so forth,

00:34:02.083 --> 00:34:04.559
we would stabilize
our public health infrastructure,

00:34:04.583 --> 00:34:07.434
and that would already get
about 30 percent of the workforce

00:34:07.458 --> 00:34:10.268
under this kind of testing
and tracing regime.

00:34:10.292 --> 00:34:12.601
And then you'd move on,
with that stabilized,

00:34:12.625 --> 00:34:15.393
to other critical
and essential workers, etc.

00:34:15.417 --> 00:34:17.309
So the bad news, Chris, is you know,

00:34:17.333 --> 00:34:20.601
who would be the last people
to be folded into this?

00:34:20.625 --> 00:34:22.149
It would be you, it would be me,

00:34:22.173 --> 00:34:24.809
the people who can actually
telecommute for work, OK.

00:34:24.833 --> 00:34:29.143
Because we would have
the least call on social needs

00:34:29.167 --> 00:34:31.025
to pull us back out into the workforce.

00:34:31.049 --> 00:34:33.184
So we'd be the last ones out.

00:34:33.208 --> 00:34:34.476
But that's a good thing,

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:38.018
I think that's a part of making the point
that we're all in this together

00:34:38.042 --> 00:34:40.393
and that there are sacrifices
in different places,

00:34:40.417 --> 00:34:42.643
and service workers,
care workers and so forth

00:34:42.667 --> 00:34:44.226
would be able to get out faster.

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:47.393
CA: And that addresses what is definitely
one of the most shocking

00:34:47.417 --> 00:34:49.476
and painful aspects of the current moment,

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.018
which is, you know,
for those of us working from home

00:34:52.042 --> 00:34:53.309
it feels traumatic,

00:34:53.333 --> 00:34:56.393
but it's nothing like
what others are experiencing,

00:34:56.417 --> 00:34:59.768
whose livelihood depends
on being out there,

00:34:59.792 --> 00:35:01.726
doing, you know, physical work.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:07.518
And so I think it's excellent, obviously,
that the plan focuses on them first.

00:35:07.542 --> 00:35:10.226
How applicable is this to other countries?

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:13.500
You're obviously talking --
The plan is developed for the US.

00:35:14.875 --> 00:35:18.476
It's inspired by what's happened,
in some ways, in some Asian countries.

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.768
Is it applicable
to other countries as well?

00:35:20.792 --> 00:35:22.059
DA: It absolutely is,

00:35:22.083 --> 00:35:24.393
and we're already seeing Europe
move in this way.

00:35:24.417 --> 00:35:27.018
So Europe and the UK
are ahead of the US on this point,

00:35:27.042 --> 00:35:29.851
I mean, the rough shape of the plan
that we're proposing

00:35:29.875 --> 00:35:33.018
seems to be pretty much the rough shape
of the plan that's emerging

00:35:33.042 --> 00:35:34.309
in Europe and the UK.

00:35:34.333 --> 00:35:36.309
So I think it's a really important moment

00:35:36.333 --> 00:35:38.476
to bring together
those policy conversations,

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.559
bring together
those modeling conversations

00:35:40.583 --> 00:35:43.018
and help each other out on this one.

00:35:43.042 --> 00:35:46.268
CA: And I guess the reason
I'm delighted that you're engaged in this

00:35:46.292 --> 00:35:47.833
is that it's --

00:35:49.208 --> 00:35:51.143
You know, it's fundamentally framed here

00:35:51.167 --> 00:35:53.518
as this is a discussion
that society has to have.

00:35:53.542 --> 00:35:55.685
There are ethical choices
we have to make here

00:35:55.709 --> 00:35:57.393
as part of this.

00:35:57.417 --> 00:36:01.018
And so we can't just
leave it up to the scientists,

00:36:01.042 --> 00:36:02.809
as brilliant as they are.

00:36:02.833 --> 00:36:04.726
And the politicians, for goodness sake.

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:08.518
We all need to understand
what is at stake here,

00:36:08.542 --> 00:36:12.226
what the choices are,
what the hard choices are

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:14.601
and know that any direction is tricky,

00:36:14.625 --> 00:36:16.309
but we, you know --

00:36:16.333 --> 00:36:18.934
This really matters.

00:36:18.958 --> 00:36:20.226
DA: Absolutely.

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:22.268
I think you've put it so well.

00:36:22.292 --> 00:36:25.721
I think that's what makes this kind
of question different in a democracy.

00:36:25.745 --> 00:36:29.059
It really is important that we all
collectively achieve understanding,

00:36:29.083 --> 00:36:31.143
have clarity about the directional options

00:36:31.167 --> 00:36:35.476
and have a sense of collectively moving
in a direction that we desire, right.

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:37.708
That we consent to, in a sense.

00:36:38.958 --> 00:36:40.601
CA: Corey.

00:36:40.625 --> 00:36:42.309
CH: Hi, I just wanted to come back

00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:45.976
and give you a little feedback
on what people are saying online

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.726
in terms of the testing,

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:50.309
to be able to go back to work,

00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:52.143
you know, how people feel about that.

00:36:52.167 --> 00:36:55.809
Obviously, there's lots of questions
about the app and privacy.

00:36:55.833 --> 00:36:57.518
Some people are hesitant about it,

00:36:57.542 --> 00:36:59.733
they're wondering
whether it will be mandatory,

00:36:59.757 --> 00:37:02.226
which you touched on.

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:05.018
Maybe you will opt in
to be able to go back in the office.

00:37:05.042 --> 00:37:09.726
I'm in, I would test to be able
to go back in the office myself,

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:11.851
but I think people
are wondering about that.

00:37:11.875 --> 00:37:17.601
But the general consensus is
it seems like a reasonable possibility.

00:37:17.625 --> 00:37:19.518
There are a couple of questions.

00:37:19.542 --> 00:37:21.059
One I think you just touched on

00:37:21.083 --> 00:37:23.643
in terms of the global possibilities.

00:37:23.667 --> 00:37:28.684
Do you see some collaboration
on the global landscape,

00:37:28.708 --> 00:37:30.643
do you see people talking to each other?

00:37:30.667 --> 00:37:33.559
Obviously, if we want
international travel to come back,

00:37:33.583 --> 00:37:36.268
that seems like a key piece of it.

00:37:36.292 --> 00:37:37.559
DA: Yes.

00:37:37.583 --> 00:37:40.184
So I think travel is one
of the hardest pieces of this,

00:37:40.208 --> 00:37:42.434
and actually I don't think
that there are good,

00:37:42.458 --> 00:37:43.726
clear answers on that yet.

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:47.018
Scientists are talking to each other
across international boundaries

00:37:47.042 --> 00:37:48.309
without any questions.

00:37:48.333 --> 00:37:50.643
I think the scientific
community is really well

00:37:50.667 --> 00:37:53.851
and at work, really connected,
trying to think about these things.

00:37:53.875 --> 00:37:57.226
It's not clear to me how well-networked
the policy-making community is,

00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:58.518
in all honesty.

00:37:58.542 --> 00:38:01.143
So I think there's probably
a lot of room for building

00:38:01.167 --> 00:38:05.351
a tighter international network
of policy makers on that front.

00:38:05.375 --> 00:38:08.018
And the hardest part
is going to be the travel piece.

00:38:08.042 --> 00:38:11.934
And honestly, we haven't even
talked about parts of the globe

00:38:11.958 --> 00:38:15.934
like Africa or India, South America,

00:38:15.958 --> 00:38:19.059
where they're not yet getting towards
this policy paradigm.

00:38:19.083 --> 00:38:23.268
So the virus is going to live
in the world, without any question.

00:38:23.292 --> 00:38:26.184
And live in the world
probably in quite significant ways

00:38:26.208 --> 00:38:28.351
for a considerable period of time.

00:38:28.375 --> 00:38:30.851
So I think the role of travel restrictions

00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:34.059
is probably going to be
with us for a spell.

00:38:34.083 --> 00:38:37.809
And so it really does matter
that we get the design of those right.

00:38:37.833 --> 00:38:40.059
I think it's Hong Kong
that has a particularly,

00:38:40.083 --> 00:38:42.476
what looks to me
like a sort of, useful regime,

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:46.059
where anybody who is coming into Hong Kong
for longer than two weeks

00:38:46.083 --> 00:38:49.518
has to go into 14-day quarantine
when they arrive.

00:38:49.542 --> 00:38:51.828
But for anybody who is coming
for a shorter time,

00:38:51.852 --> 00:38:53.726
they have to be tested when they arrive

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:56.393
and then they have to also
go through active monitoring

00:38:56.417 --> 00:38:58.518
during the period
of their time in Hong Kong,

00:38:58.542 --> 00:39:02.059
which means having temperature checks
and so forth reported.

00:39:02.083 --> 00:39:04.101
So I think that's a reasonable thing to do

00:39:04.125 --> 00:39:07.518
in order to keep
business travel up and running,

00:39:07.542 --> 00:39:10.792
even as we're all trying to deal
with controlling the virus.

00:39:12.042 --> 00:39:15.018
CH: And you also mentioned solidarity

00:39:15.042 --> 00:39:17.101
and I think that touches
on another question

00:39:17.125 --> 00:39:18.768
that someone brought up online

00:39:18.792 --> 00:39:25.351
about some of the social impacts
after the 1918 epidemic

00:39:25.375 --> 00:39:27.184
and the fear,

00:39:27.208 --> 00:39:30.893
and the, you know, the fear of the other,

00:39:30.917 --> 00:39:33.351
and foreigners and all that.

00:39:33.375 --> 00:39:35.768
And how do we get through this

00:39:35.792 --> 00:39:38.268
without that kind of fallout

00:39:38.292 --> 00:39:41.018
and you know, how do we,
kind of, keep ourselves together

00:39:41.042 --> 00:39:42.583
and looking out for each other?

00:39:43.583 --> 00:39:46.018
DA: I think that's such
a hugely important question.

00:39:46.042 --> 00:39:48.184
And I mean, in one sense it's easy,

00:39:48.208 --> 00:39:53.809
because the virus is an adversary
to every human being equally, right.

00:39:53.833 --> 00:39:57.726
We are all completely equal
in relationship to it.

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:01.434
And so what we are really
all aspiring to here is

00:40:01.458 --> 00:40:05.643
sort of transformation of our basic
socioeconomic infrastructure

00:40:05.667 --> 00:40:09.809
in a way that puts us all
on a footing to be pandemic-resilient.

00:40:09.833 --> 00:40:12.143
So I've been using the metaphor

00:40:12.167 --> 00:40:14.143
we need to put ourselves on a war footing

00:40:14.167 --> 00:40:16.226
to mobilize the economy
to fight the virus,

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:19.768
and I stand by that in a sense
that we do need to mobilize the economy.

00:40:19.792 --> 00:40:21.393
But really at the end of the day,

00:40:21.417 --> 00:40:24.601
it's not a war against a human adversary
or anything of that kind.

00:40:24.625 --> 00:40:26.476
And so what we're really talking about

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.268
goes back to the questions
about the health infrastructure,

00:40:29.292 --> 00:40:30.559
health care.

00:40:30.583 --> 00:40:33.726
We're really talking about achieving
a transformed peace situation

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:36.643
where our economies and our societies
are pandemic-resilient.

00:40:36.667 --> 00:40:38.268
That's the real goal here

00:40:38.292 --> 00:40:40.268
and it really does require an investment,

00:40:40.292 --> 00:40:43.934
so because of the 2003 SARS experience,

00:40:43.958 --> 00:40:48.726
Asian nations have been investing
over the last five years or plus,

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:52.184
in pandemic-resilient equipment
and infrastructure.

00:40:52.208 --> 00:40:53.726
We haven't done that in the US,

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:56.750
so we find ourselves in a position
where we have to accelerate

00:40:56.774 --> 00:40:58.018
in a matter of months,

00:40:58.042 --> 00:41:01.809
something that has taken other people
years to build and develop.

00:41:01.833 --> 00:41:03.643
So I think really focusing on that,

00:41:03.667 --> 00:41:08.476
and the goal is an economy
that's not vulnerable to pandemic, right.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.018
I mean, because we don't want
to leave this pandemic

00:41:11.042 --> 00:41:13.643
and have the economy be
just as vulnerable to pandemic

00:41:13.667 --> 00:41:16.768
at the end of the pandemic
as we were at the beginning of it.

00:41:16.792 --> 00:41:18.697
We don't want to be vulnerable this way.

00:41:18.721 --> 00:41:19.976
And so in that regard,

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.417
the job is to build in that infrastructure
for pandemic resilience ASAP.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.268
CA: Wow.

00:41:27.292 --> 00:41:28.559
CH: Thank you.

00:41:28.583 --> 00:41:34.309
CA: Danielle, given the price tag
you're talking about on this,

00:41:34.333 --> 00:41:38.476
half a trillion dollars, basically, up to.

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:41.851
That's significantly less than some
of the multitrillion dollar numbers

00:41:41.875 --> 00:41:43.393
that are getting thrown around,

00:41:43.417 --> 00:41:45.726
so, I mean in terms
of the scale of the problem,

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:47.559
it's probably an appropriate number.

00:41:47.583 --> 00:41:50.060
But it sounds like,
to have any chance of doing this,

00:41:50.084 --> 00:41:52.476
this would have to be
a kind of federal initiative

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:53.893
at some level.

00:41:53.917 --> 00:41:55.268
DA: Yes.

00:41:55.292 --> 00:41:58.643
CA: We have a problem
that more than half the country

00:41:58.667 --> 00:42:01.851
fundamentally doesn't trust

00:42:01.875 --> 00:42:04.184
key parts of the administration,

00:42:04.208 --> 00:42:05.476
let's say.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.684
How could this be framed
in a way that could build trust

00:42:08.708 --> 00:42:13.018
and make it feel like
this is the country as a whole,

00:42:13.042 --> 00:42:16.518
that there's this coalition
of trusted voices

00:42:16.542 --> 00:42:20.208
who are the final decision makers on this?

00:42:21.542 --> 00:42:24.518
DA: So we have this incredible
federalist system,

00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:26.184
and we need to see it as an asset.

00:42:26.208 --> 00:42:29.018
It's modularized and flexible,
and we need to activate that.

00:42:29.042 --> 00:42:31.309
We do need all the parts
of the system working,

00:42:31.333 --> 00:42:34.309
so we do need the federal
government working on behalf of this,

00:42:34.333 --> 00:42:37.934
we need the state governments working
and municipal governments.

00:42:37.958 --> 00:42:39.351
On the federal end of things,

00:42:39.375 --> 00:42:40.643
we need Congress to fund.

00:42:40.667 --> 00:42:41.934
So in the first instance,

00:42:41.958 --> 00:42:44.809
there's a really big need
for funding legislation,

00:42:44.833 --> 00:42:49.101
and also, Congress can really help
by directing investment,

00:42:49.125 --> 00:42:50.983
not just in the testing program itself,

00:42:51.007 --> 00:42:53.059
but in the national service corps,

00:42:53.083 --> 00:42:55.143
probably flowing
through state governments,

00:42:55.167 --> 00:42:57.559
through the national --

00:42:57.583 --> 00:43:00.268
The reserves in every state.

00:43:00.292 --> 00:43:02.184
That would be sort of health reserves.

00:43:02.208 --> 00:43:03.976
You know, really expand that program

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.268
with a combination of employment program
and backing up that sector.

00:43:07.292 --> 00:43:09.976
So there's a lot for Congress to do
as a part of this.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.059
For the testing program, we really do need
the kind of procurement order

00:43:14.083 --> 00:43:15.351
to produce capacity

00:43:15.375 --> 00:43:18.143
that the Defense Department
is the best example of.

00:43:18.167 --> 00:43:21.976
So in the ideal, a sort of
testing supply board

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.934
that brought in leading figures
who are masters of supply chain logistics

00:43:26.958 --> 00:43:28.226
from the private sector,

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:30.917
working in close coordination
with the federal government

00:43:30.941 --> 00:43:32.184
would be great.

00:43:32.208 --> 00:43:35.393
The White House has recently,
in the last week or so,

00:43:35.417 --> 00:43:38.518
begun to put in pieces
of architecture that goes in this way,

00:43:38.542 --> 00:43:41.559
sort of a testing
supply czar, for example,

00:43:41.583 --> 00:43:44.601
an admiral, I believe.

00:43:44.625 --> 00:43:46.559
So we need people of that kind

00:43:46.583 --> 00:43:50.184
who are really superb masters
of logistics, procurement,

00:43:50.208 --> 00:43:51.851
contracts and that sort of thing,

00:43:51.875 --> 00:43:56.018
to be able to ramp up
an active, functional supply chain

00:43:56.042 --> 00:44:00.143
for testing to deliver at the order
of tens of millions of tests a day.

00:44:00.167 --> 00:44:02.893
So we do need [unclear],
absolutely is a key part of that,

00:44:02.917 --> 00:44:04.184
key driver of that.

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:06.768
And so it's a time for all
the parts of our government

00:44:06.792 --> 00:44:10.083
to come together and do
their respective pieces.

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:14.309
CA: So I'm kind of in awe
at the scale at which you're thinking.

00:44:14.333 --> 00:44:16.184
I guess as we wrap up here,

00:44:16.208 --> 00:44:21.309
if I might, I'd love to just
go to a bit more personal place.

00:44:21.333 --> 00:44:23.601
Like, I'm just curious about you

00:44:23.625 --> 00:44:26.851
and what is it in your past

00:44:26.875 --> 00:44:29.309
that is, sort of,

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:30.857
is providing the fire right now,

00:44:30.881 --> 00:44:34.393
the drive to try to do this?

00:44:34.417 --> 00:44:35.684
How are you?

00:44:35.708 --> 00:44:37.667
How are you feeling about this?

00:44:38.708 --> 00:44:40.851
Tell us a bit about you, please.

00:44:40.875 --> 00:44:44.125
DA: Well, that's a very generous question.

00:44:45.042 --> 00:44:49.143
You know, I love this country.

00:44:49.167 --> 00:44:52.101
I'll admit that's where
the motivation starts from,

00:44:52.125 --> 00:44:53.393
in the sense that,

00:44:53.417 --> 00:44:56.351
like, lots of people would say
that I'm a global humanitarian,

00:44:56.375 --> 00:44:59.184
and watching the world
succumb to the disease motivates me.

00:44:59.208 --> 00:45:01.851
I think of Paul Farmer for example,
as an example.

00:45:01.875 --> 00:45:03.559
And I respect that and I get that,

00:45:03.583 --> 00:45:05.976
but at the end of the day,
I love my country.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.559
And it hurt, just hurt,
in the beginning of this,

00:45:09.583 --> 00:45:11.518
and what hurt particularly,

00:45:11.542 --> 00:45:15.893
was I was very clear, early on,
that I was getting better information

00:45:15.917 --> 00:45:17.809
as a member of the Harvard faculty

00:45:17.833 --> 00:45:20.351
than my fellow parishioners,

00:45:20.375 --> 00:45:24.476
than the people who were serving me
in restaurants and cafes,

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:28.059
and it just like, that made me
angry, in all honesty.

00:45:28.083 --> 00:45:30.893
As a combination
of those two things, I was like,

00:45:30.917 --> 00:45:32.434
A, I want to understand this,

00:45:32.458 --> 00:45:34.393
and B, I want to share what I understand

00:45:34.417 --> 00:45:37.768
because it's not fair
that people like me get it,

00:45:37.792 --> 00:45:40.417
and that's not being shared
with other people.

00:45:42.167 --> 00:45:44.393
CA: Wow, that's powerful.

00:45:44.417 --> 00:45:47.476
I think all of us,
we all feel this weird mixture

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:53.851
of almost guilt at how fortunate
a position some of us are in.

00:45:53.875 --> 00:45:56.458
Certainly a lot of gratitude, anger.

00:45:59.333 --> 00:46:04.583
Were you persuaded, Whitney,
by this idea, by the possibility of it?

00:46:05.958 --> 00:46:07.518
CH: Sorry, you're meaning me.

00:46:07.542 --> 00:46:09.976
CA: Sorry! (Laughs)
Did I say Whitney?

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.809
CH: Totally OK.

00:46:11.833 --> 00:46:13.434
Whitney's your usual pal.

00:46:13.458 --> 00:46:15.476
CA: I'm the world's worst person on names,

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:18.559
and Whitney and I have been
hanging out here the last few weeks.

00:46:18.583 --> 00:46:19.851
Corey.

00:46:19.875 --> 00:46:21.143
CH: It's absolutely fine.

00:46:21.167 --> 00:46:23.458
Being mistaken for Whitney
is a huge compliment.

00:46:24.375 --> 00:46:25.643
It's very persuasive,

00:46:25.667 --> 00:46:29.393
and I think so hopeful to hear
a constructive plan

00:46:29.417 --> 00:46:35.434
and a feeling that there is a path
out of this that is both possible for us

00:46:35.458 --> 00:46:36.726
as humans,

00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:38.268
to get back to being together,

00:46:38.292 --> 00:46:41.583
but then also as an economy
and as a country.

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.684
I'm really inspired by your work

00:46:44.708 --> 00:46:47.458
and so grateful to you
for sharing it with us.

00:46:48.321 --> 00:46:49.893
DA: I appreciate that, thank you.

00:46:49.917 --> 00:46:52.184
I'm really glad to get a chance
to talk about it

00:46:52.208 --> 00:46:55.809
and share the knowledge
that our group has acquired

00:46:55.833 --> 00:46:57.101
over the last month.

00:46:57.125 --> 00:46:58.434
So thank you.

00:46:58.458 --> 00:47:01.839
CA: So if someone wants to keep in touch
with the progress of this idea,

00:47:01.863 --> 00:47:03.113
what should they do?

00:47:03.958 --> 00:47:07.476
DA: OK, so now I should know
our website URL by heart,

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:10.143
but of course, I don't, I'm afraid.

00:47:10.167 --> 00:47:14.851
If somebody googles "COVID,"

00:47:14.875 --> 00:47:19.893
"Safra," "Allen," that's my surname,

00:47:19.917 --> 00:47:21.643
our website will come up.

00:47:21.667 --> 00:47:25.143
So if you just remember those three words,
"COVID," "Safra," "Allen,"

00:47:25.167 --> 00:47:26.434
and Google that,

00:47:26.458 --> 00:47:28.393
you should get to our white papers,

00:47:28.417 --> 00:47:29.934
op-eds, things like that.

00:47:29.958 --> 00:47:33.101
We are hoping to have
our full policy road map

00:47:33.125 --> 00:47:34.934
published by the end of the week.

00:47:34.958 --> 00:47:36.250
That's our target goal.

00:47:37.083 --> 00:47:40.976
CA: Yeah. It's: ethics.harvard.edu.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.768
DA: OK.

00:47:42.792 --> 00:47:45.101
Exactly, that takes you
to the main landing page,

00:47:45.125 --> 00:47:46.518
and then to the COVID site.

00:47:46.542 --> 00:47:49.184
CA: And then to the COVID-19
from there, yeah.

00:47:49.208 --> 00:47:50.458
DA: Exactly.

00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:54.601
CA: Alright, well,
thank you so much, Danielle,

00:47:54.625 --> 00:47:56.476
I found this absolutely fascinating.

00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:57.768
DA: Thank you.

00:47:57.792 --> 00:47:59.643
CA: It's going to take --

00:47:59.667 --> 00:48:01.893
I mean, this is not an ordinary idea.

00:48:01.917 --> 00:48:04.809
We don't often at TED
have someone come and say,

00:48:04.833 --> 00:48:08.184
"Yeah, I've got this idea
for how to spend half a trillion dollars,

00:48:08.208 --> 00:48:12.226
and it could make a difference
between the US

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:15.809
and other places around the world
actually getting the economy going again.

00:48:15.833 --> 00:48:21.351
That's not usual, so this has been
a gift to us today, thank you for that.

00:48:21.375 --> 00:48:22.643
DA: Thank you.

00:48:22.667 --> 00:48:25.268
CA: To everyone listening,
this is an important debate.

00:48:25.292 --> 00:48:26.601
And it's not finished yet,

00:48:26.625 --> 00:48:31.601
there will be many other contributions
to ideas like this, I think.

00:48:31.625 --> 00:48:32.934
DA: That's for sure.

00:48:32.958 --> 00:48:35.184
CA: Yeah, chip in, chip in.

00:48:35.208 --> 00:48:38.768
Thank you all so much
for being part of this today.

00:48:38.792 --> 00:48:40.393
We're back again tomorrow.

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:42.750
Corey, do you have details on that?

00:48:43.625 --> 00:48:44.893
CH: I do.

00:48:44.917 --> 00:48:47.684
And also, you can listen
to this conversation

00:48:47.708 --> 00:48:51.059
on our website TED.com or on Facebook,

00:48:51.083 --> 00:48:54.768
and you can also listen
to the recording of it

00:48:54.792 --> 00:48:56.559
through TED Interview.

00:48:56.583 --> 00:49:01.101
So if you missed any parts of it
or you want to pass it along to a friend.

00:49:01.125 --> 00:49:05.184
We have some more
amazing speakers coming up

00:49:05.208 --> 00:49:06.809
I might glance at my cheat sheet,

00:49:06.833 --> 00:49:09.309
but tomorrow we have Esther Choo,

00:49:09.333 --> 00:49:12.559
who is an emergency
physician and professor

00:49:12.583 --> 00:49:14.976
and she is going to share
with us what she's seen

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.434
on the front lines of this crisis.

00:49:17.458 --> 00:49:21.059
On Wednesday, Chris and I
will be speaking with Ray Dalio,

00:49:21.083 --> 00:49:22.976
the founder of Bridgewater,

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.434
and he is going to address

00:49:24.458 --> 00:49:28.601
the market and economic
implications of this pandemic.

00:49:28.625 --> 00:49:31.684
And on Thursday, we have two speakers,

00:49:31.708 --> 00:49:35.309
Gayathri Vasudevan,

00:49:35.333 --> 00:49:37.976
who is going to share with us
what's happening in India,

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.976
and Fareed Zakaria, a journalist.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.934
Friday, we'll wrap things up
with a musician and artist Jacob Collier.

00:49:45.958 --> 00:49:48.333
So we have a lot
of amazing things coming up.

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:52.809
CA: We do, so calendar it if you can,

00:49:52.833 --> 00:49:56.000
apart from anything else,
we just like your company here every day.

00:49:57.042 --> 00:49:59.393
We'll get through this together.

00:49:59.417 --> 00:50:01.227
Thanks so much for being part of this.

00:50:01.251 --> 00:50:02.726
Danielle, thanks again.

00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:04.809
DA: Thank you, goodbye.

00:50:04.833 --> 00:50:06.083
CH: Bye.
