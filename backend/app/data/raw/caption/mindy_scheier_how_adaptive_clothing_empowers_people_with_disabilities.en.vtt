00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:13.960
I love fashion.

00:00:14.693 --> 00:00:18.622
I actually go to bed every night
thinking about what I'm going to wear

00:00:18.646 --> 00:00:19.865
the next day.

00:00:20.549 --> 00:00:22.992
Clothing transforms me,

00:00:23.016 --> 00:00:24.578
defines me,

00:00:24.602 --> 00:00:26.052
gives me confidence.

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.356
You may not feel
the same way about fashion,

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.702
but I bet you have a favorite T-shirt
or a pair of jeans that transforms you --

00:00:35.726 --> 00:00:37.253
makes you feel good,

00:00:37.277 --> 00:00:39.006
makes you feel confident,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.649
makes you feel like you.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.202
When I was younger,

00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:45.439
I wanted to be Betsey Johnson.

00:00:45.463 --> 00:00:48.806
I thought we were kindred,
crazy-hair spirits together.

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:51.373
I did go to fashion design,

00:00:51.397 --> 00:00:53.956
I worked in the industry for years

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.237
and loved it.

00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:57.112
I married,

00:00:57.136 --> 00:00:58.701
I had three kids.

00:00:59.746 --> 00:01:03.439
But life can be heartbreakingly ironic.

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:10.549
My middle child, Oliver, was born
with a rare form of muscular dystrophy,

00:01:10.573 --> 00:01:11.726
or MD.

00:01:12.173 --> 00:01:15.730
MD affects his muscle strength,

00:01:15.754 --> 00:01:17.257
his pulmonary system,

00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:18.794
distorts his body

00:01:18.818 --> 00:01:21.884
and makes everyday life
more challenging than most.

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.900
From the time he could walk,

00:01:23.924 --> 00:01:25.886
which wasn't until about two and a half,

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.103
he had to wear leg braces for stability.

00:01:28.606 --> 00:01:30.893
Because he wasn't growing appropriately,

00:01:30.917 --> 00:01:34.057
he had to wear a feeding tube
that was placed on his face.

00:01:34.751 --> 00:01:37.466
He endured stares, and so did I.

00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:41.698
But my husband Greg and I told him

00:01:41.722 --> 00:01:43.612
that no matter what,

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:45.496
he was just like everybody else.

00:01:46.916 --> 00:01:48.871
But everyday tasks for Oliver

00:01:49.604 --> 00:01:51.676
that we all take for granted

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.535
were incredibly challenging.

00:01:54.803 --> 00:01:59.693
That simple act of dressing yourself --
the very thing that I adore --

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.332
was a nightmare for him.

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:06.346
His form of MD does not affect his mind.

00:02:07.083 --> 00:02:09.059
His brain is an A-plus,

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:11.900
which means he's acutely aware
of his shortcomings.

00:02:12.418 --> 00:02:16.345
This became very evident
when he started school,

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:21.083
and that daily act of dressing yourself
was a constant reminder

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:23.932
of what he could and could not do.

00:02:26.171 --> 00:02:30.469
So our solution was for Oliver
to wear sweatpants every day:

00:02:30.493 --> 00:02:31.661
to school,

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:32.836
to parties,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.269
on vacations --

00:02:34.293 --> 00:02:35.443
his uniform.

00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:39.970
For special occasions,
he would wear proper pants.

00:02:39.994 --> 00:02:43.818
But many times, because he couldn't manage
the button and zipper,

00:02:43.842 --> 00:02:46.548
I would have to take him
to the men's room,

00:02:46.572 --> 00:02:49.088
which was incredibly embarrassing for him

00:02:49.112 --> 00:02:51.214
and the other men that were in there.

00:02:51.238 --> 00:02:54.833
But them -- I said, "Oh, please.
There's nothing I haven't seen before."

00:02:54.857 --> 00:02:56.221
(Laughter)

00:02:56.245 --> 00:02:58.628
For years we muddled through.

00:02:58.652 --> 00:03:01.243
But when Oliver was in third grade,

00:03:01.267 --> 00:03:06.020
I found out he was more like me
than I ever imagined.

00:03:06.437 --> 00:03:08.685
Oliver, too, cared about fashion.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.528
He came home from school one day
and said very definitively

00:03:13.552 --> 00:03:17.376
that he was going to wear jeans to school
like everybody else gets to wear.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.050
Well, I certainly couldn't go
to class with him

00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:21.900
and take him to the boys' room,

00:03:21.924 --> 00:03:25.760
but there was no way
I was telling my eight-year-old

00:03:25.784 --> 00:03:28.049
that he couldn't wear
what he wanted to wear.

00:03:28.628 --> 00:03:30.011
So that night,

00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:33.117
I MacGyvered the hell out of his jeans.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.346
I remembered when I was pregnant

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.634
and unwilling to stop wearing
my own favorite pants,

00:03:39.658 --> 00:03:41.678
even though I was busting out of them,

00:03:41.702 --> 00:03:43.322
that rubber-band trick.

00:03:43.346 --> 00:03:45.969
You moms remember what I'm talking about?

00:03:45.993 --> 00:03:47.852
The rubber band through the buttonhole,

00:03:47.876 --> 00:03:49.433
around the button and back?

00:03:49.457 --> 00:03:50.734
Instant stretch.

00:03:51.358 --> 00:03:52.884
So I removed the zipper

00:03:53.837 --> 00:03:56.201
so he could pull it
up and down on his own.

00:03:56.225 --> 00:04:00.073
I cut up the side seam
of the bottom of his pants

00:04:00.097 --> 00:04:02.118
to accommodate for his leg braces,

00:04:02.142 --> 00:04:03.663
applied Velcro --

00:04:03.687 --> 00:04:07.308
hold your ears, everybody:
peel and stick, mind you --

00:04:07.332 --> 00:04:09.248
so that it would close around it.

00:04:10.237 --> 00:04:14.077
When I showed Oliver
my arts and crafts project,

00:04:14.101 --> 00:04:16.460
he absolutely beamed.

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:20.117
He went into school
with his head held so high.

00:04:20.807 --> 00:04:22.873
Those jeans transformed him.

00:04:23.392 --> 00:04:26.110
He was able to get dressed on his own,

00:04:26.134 --> 00:04:28.554
he was able to go
to the bathroom on his own;

00:04:28.578 --> 00:04:30.989
those jeans gave him confidence.

00:04:31.816 --> 00:04:33.589
I didn't realize it at the time,

00:04:33.613 --> 00:04:37.974
but this was my first foray
into the world of adaptive clothing.

00:04:38.563 --> 00:04:43.961
Adaptive clothing is defined as clothing
designed for people with disabilities,

00:04:43.985 --> 00:04:45.169
the elderly

00:04:45.193 --> 00:04:48.922
and anyone who struggles
with dressing themselves.

00:04:49.694 --> 00:04:52.080
Adaptive clothing did exist,

00:04:52.771 --> 00:04:55.877
but it was missing that mainstream
fashion component.

00:04:56.361 --> 00:04:59.451
It was very medicinal and very functional

00:04:59.475 --> 00:05:00.904
but not stylish.

00:05:01.816 --> 00:05:03.782
And that's a huge problem,

00:05:03.806 --> 00:05:06.463
because what you wear matters.

00:05:06.987 --> 00:05:09.237
Clothing can affect your mood,

00:05:09.261 --> 00:05:10.412
your health

00:05:10.436 --> 00:05:11.759
and your self-esteem.

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:15.178
Now, being a fashion lover,
I've known this forever,

00:05:15.202 --> 00:05:18.315
but scientists actually
have a name for it.

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:20.981
It's called "Enclothed Cognition,"

00:05:21.801 --> 00:05:23.904
the co-occurrence of two factors:

00:05:23.928 --> 00:05:26.298
the symbolic meaning of clothing

00:05:26.322 --> 00:05:29.710
and the physical experience
of wearing the clothing,

00:05:30.441 --> 00:05:34.750
both of which have a direct correlation
to how you feel about yourself.

00:05:35.476 --> 00:05:40.046
There's actually a professor in the UK
by the name of Karen J. Pine.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.121
She wrote a book called
"Mind What You Wear:

00:05:43.145 --> 00:05:45.001
The Psychology of Fashion."

00:05:45.396 --> 00:05:47.165
She states in her book

00:05:47.944 --> 00:05:50.329
that when you put clothes on,

00:05:50.353 --> 00:05:53.537
you adapt the characteristics
of what you're wearing,

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:55.649
whether you realize it or not.

00:05:56.386 --> 00:05:59.301
That's why you feel like a rock star

00:06:00.216 --> 00:06:03.357
when you put on
those perfect-fitting jeans.

00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:07.873
That's why you feel invincible
when you put on that power suit,

00:06:07.897 --> 00:06:09.848
and that's why you feel beautiful

00:06:10.493 --> 00:06:12.142
in that little black dress.

00:06:12.166 --> 00:06:16.169
But that's exactly why
Oliver felt so isolated

00:06:16.193 --> 00:06:18.415
when he couldn't wear
what he wanted to wear.

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:19.888
He even said to me one time,

00:06:19.912 --> 00:06:22.583
"Mom, wearing sweatpants every day

00:06:22.607 --> 00:06:26.923
makes me feel like I'm dressing disabled."

00:06:28.109 --> 00:06:32.502
There are one billion people on our planet

00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:34.591
that experience some type of disability.

00:06:34.615 --> 00:06:36.258
One billion.

00:06:37.067 --> 00:06:42.578
If 10 percent of that billion
experience clothing challenges,

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:46.869
that's an enormous amount of people
that may not be as confident,

00:06:46.893 --> 00:06:48.603
as successful

00:06:48.627 --> 00:06:51.365
or even as happy as they could be.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.580
The morning after Oliver left for school
wearing those jeans,

00:06:56.604 --> 00:07:00.204
I realized that I could
do something about that.

00:07:00.976 --> 00:07:02.278
And so I did.

00:07:02.746 --> 00:07:07.657
In 2013, I founded an organization
called Runway of Dreams.

00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:12.329
The mission was to educate
the fashion industry

00:07:12.353 --> 00:07:15.622
that modifications could be made
to mainstream clothing

00:07:16.284 --> 00:07:19.508
for this community
that has never been served.

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:24.014
And it began with an entire
year of research.

00:07:24.721 --> 00:07:28.317
I went to schools, I went to facilities,
I went to hospitals.

00:07:28.341 --> 00:07:32.056
I literally chased down people
on the street who were in wheelchairs

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.322
or if they had walkers

00:07:33.346 --> 00:07:35.422
or even if they had a slight limp.

00:07:35.446 --> 00:07:36.643
(Laughter)

00:07:36.667 --> 00:07:38.419
I know I must have looked insane,

00:07:38.443 --> 00:07:41.706
but I knew that if I was really
going to make a difference,

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.303
I had to truly understand
the clothing challenges

00:07:45.327 --> 00:07:47.798
of as many different people
as I possibly could.

00:07:48.989 --> 00:07:53.247
I met a young man who was 18
who has cerebral palsy.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:55.706
He was going to Harvard University.

00:07:56.371 --> 00:07:58.742
He said to me, "Can you imagine?

00:07:58.766 --> 00:08:00.655
I got myself into Harvard,

00:08:01.256 --> 00:08:05.525
but my dream is to be able
to wear jeans on campus,

00:08:05.549 --> 00:08:07.338
like the other freshmen will wear."

00:08:07.785 --> 00:08:10.160
I met a little girl named Gianna,

00:08:10.789 --> 00:08:13.903
who was missing
her left forearm and her hand.

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:16.006
Her mother told me

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.689
she could not bear to see
her daughter's difference magnified

00:08:19.713 --> 00:08:21.130
by a dangling sleeve,

00:08:21.489 --> 00:08:25.303
so she had every single long-sleeve shirt
professionally tailored.

00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:28.307
Can you imagine the time
and money she spent?

00:08:29.613 --> 00:08:33.821
I also had the great privilege
of spending time with Eric LeGrand,

00:08:33.845 --> 00:08:38.871
former Rutgers football player
who was paralyzed during a tackle in 2010.

00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:43.725
I had, at this point,
seen some unfathomable things,

00:08:43.749 --> 00:08:46.579
but this, by far,
was the most heart-stopping.

00:08:47.055 --> 00:08:49.301
You see, Eric is a really big guy,

00:08:49.325 --> 00:08:53.653
and it took two aides
and a lifting machine

00:08:53.677 --> 00:08:55.034
to get him dressed.

00:08:55.498 --> 00:08:59.190
I sat and watched this process
for over two hours.

00:08:59.214 --> 00:09:02.193
When I expressed my shock to Eric,

00:09:02.217 --> 00:09:03.450
he looked at me and said,

00:09:03.474 --> 00:09:05.906
"Mindy, this is every single day.

00:09:06.433 --> 00:09:07.748
What can I say?

00:09:07.772 --> 00:09:09.155
I like to look sharp."

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.739
Research done.

00:09:12.387 --> 00:09:15.595
I knew that if I was going to make
a change in the industry,

00:09:15.619 --> 00:09:17.617
I had to use my background

00:09:18.261 --> 00:09:22.791
and really figure out
how to make these clothes modified.

00:09:23.441 --> 00:09:27.738
So I took the information
I gathered over that past year,

00:09:27.762 --> 00:09:30.636
and I figured out that there were
actually three categories

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.437
that were affected across the board.

00:09:32.841 --> 00:09:35.176
The first were closures.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.252
Buttons, snaps, zippers, hook-and-eyes
were a challenge for almost everybody.

00:09:40.276 --> 00:09:44.086
So I replaced them
with a more manageable technology:

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:45.437
magnets.

00:09:45.461 --> 00:09:50.592
Magnets made our Harvard freshman
able to wear jeans on campus,

00:09:50.616 --> 00:09:52.171
because he could dress himself.

00:09:52.811 --> 00:09:54.991
Second: adjustability.

00:09:55.015 --> 00:09:57.963
Pant lengths, sleeve lengths, waistbands

00:09:57.987 --> 00:10:00.726
were a challenge for so many
different-shaped bodies.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.803
So I added elastic,

00:10:02.827 --> 00:10:04.792
an internal hemming system.

00:10:05.325 --> 00:10:08.584
This way, Gianna could wear
a shirt right off the rack

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:10.471
and just adjust the one sleeve.

00:10:11.123 --> 00:10:14.582
Last: alternate ways to get
the clothing on and off the body,

00:10:14.606 --> 00:10:17.455
outside the traditional way
of over your head.

00:10:17.866 --> 00:10:20.934
So I designed a way to go in arms first.

00:10:20.958 --> 00:10:22.814
This, for somebody like Eric,

00:10:22.838 --> 00:10:27.023
could actually take five steps
off his dressing process

00:10:27.047 --> 00:10:30.381
and give him back the gift of time.

00:10:31.725 --> 00:10:33.544
So I went out,

00:10:33.568 --> 00:10:35.763
I bought clothing right off the rack,

00:10:35.787 --> 00:10:38.820
I sat at my kitchen table,
ripped them apart,

00:10:39.566 --> 00:10:44.542
did prototype after prototype,
until I felt I had great modifications.

00:10:45.085 --> 00:10:48.393
And then I was ready for the big leagues:

00:10:48.417 --> 00:10:50.029
the fashion industry.

00:10:51.205 --> 00:10:53.705
Rather than designing my own collection,

00:10:53.729 --> 00:10:56.312
I knew if I was really
going to make a difference,

00:10:56.336 --> 00:10:58.440
I had to go mainstream.

00:10:59.116 --> 00:11:03.990
I believed that I just needed
to educate the industry

00:11:04.014 --> 00:11:06.742
of the enormity of this population

00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:09.523
and the fact that these were consumers

00:11:10.379 --> 00:11:12.374
that simply weren't being considered.

00:11:13.237 --> 00:11:17.073
And I am thrilled to say
that the industry heard me.

00:11:18.124 --> 00:11:23.400
Runway of Dreams collaborated
with the most amazing,

00:11:23.424 --> 00:11:27.007
forward-thinking brand on our planet --

00:11:27.442 --> 00:11:30.168
(Applause)

00:11:36.294 --> 00:11:38.863
who took my vision to market

00:11:38.887 --> 00:11:41.472
and made fashion history

00:11:41.496 --> 00:11:45.766
by launching the first mainstream
adaptive collection.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.564
And the rest is yet to come.

00:11:49.549 --> 00:11:51.760
(Applause)

00:11:51.784 --> 00:11:52.961
So --

00:11:52.985 --> 00:11:54.694
(Applause)

00:11:55.415 --> 00:11:58.470
Fashion holds the key to a vital lifeline.

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:01.208
Clothing can be transformative.

00:12:01.582 --> 00:12:05.189
Clothing equals confidence.

00:12:06.062 --> 00:12:07.712
So tomorrow,

00:12:07.736 --> 00:12:09.952
when you are starting your day

00:12:09.976 --> 00:12:12.487
and you're thinking about
what you're going to wear,

00:12:12.511 --> 00:12:15.327
I hope you appreciate the process

00:12:15.351 --> 00:12:17.777
and think about how what you chose

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:19.970
makes you feel.

00:12:19.994 --> 00:12:22.572
Today, Oliver is 13.

00:12:22.596 --> 00:12:24.765
He wears his adaptive khakis,

00:12:24.789 --> 00:12:27.014
his magnetic button-front shirt --

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:28.770
feels like the coolest kid around.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:31.952
My boy has total swagger.

00:12:32.282 --> 00:12:33.432
(Laughter)

00:12:35.966 --> 00:12:37.329
As I mentioned,

00:12:39.557 --> 00:12:41.800
Oliver's disease is degenerative,

00:12:42.974 --> 00:12:46.255
which means his muscles
are going to break down over time.

00:12:47.594 --> 00:12:51.310
This, by far, is the most
devastating part for me.

00:12:52.039 --> 00:12:54.546
I have to sit on the sidelines

00:12:56.373 --> 00:12:59.068
and watch my boy deteriorate.

00:12:59.092 --> 00:13:01.214
And there's nothing I can do about it.

00:13:03.203 --> 00:13:09.898
So I am looking up from the things
that I cannot control

00:13:09.922 --> 00:13:11.586
to the things that I can,

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.300
because I have no option.

00:13:14.929 --> 00:13:16.790
And so, I am looking up.

00:13:17.608 --> 00:13:20.287
And I'm asking the fashion
industry to look up.

00:13:21.291 --> 00:13:24.020
And now, I'm asking all of you

00:13:24.628 --> 00:13:26.798
to look up, too.

00:13:27.753 --> 00:13:28.904
Thank you.

00:13:28.928 --> 00:13:32.568
(Applause)
