Tom Zimmerman: We'd like to take you
on a fantastic journey

00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:18.904
to visit the creatures we call the Elders.

00:00:19.389 --> 00:00:23.363
We call them the Elders
because a half a billion years ago

00:00:23.387 --> 00:00:26.339
they tripled the amount
of oxygen in the air,

00:00:26.363 --> 00:00:29.291
which led to an explosion of life,

00:00:29.315 --> 00:00:30.849
which led to all of us.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.126
We call them the Elders,
but you probably know them as plankton.

00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:36.677
(Laughter)

00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:41.011
Now, Simone is a physicist,
and I'm an inventor.

00:00:41.894 --> 00:00:43.070
A couple of years ago,

00:00:43.094 --> 00:00:45.341
I was giving a talk
about an invention I made --

00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:46.879
it was a 3D microscope.

00:00:46.903 --> 00:00:48.807
And Simone was in the audience.

00:00:49.244 --> 00:00:53.478
He realized that my microscope
could solve a big problem he was having.

00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:58.537
Which was, how to measure the movement
of plankton in 3D fast enough

00:00:58.561 --> 00:01:02.628
so he could mathematically model
their sensing and behavior.

00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:07.407
And I frankly needed an application
for my microscope, so ...

00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:08.839
(Laughter)

00:01:08.863 --> 00:01:10.959
It was like peanut butter meets chocolate.

00:01:10.983 --> 00:01:12.395
(Laughter)

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:16.062
So we started working together,
studying these amazing creatures.

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:19.291
And then we were alarmed
to discover something.

00:01:19.696 --> 00:01:21.809
And that's why we're here today.

00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:24.206
And I just want to do something with you.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.166
Now, please, just hold
your breath for a second.

00:01:28.047 --> 00:01:29.737
Yes, literally hold your breath.

00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:32.761
This is the world without plankton.

00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:37.314
You see, plankton generate
two-thirds of our oxygen using the sun.

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:40.336
OK, now you can breathe,
because they're still here.

00:01:41.145 --> 00:01:42.295
For now.

00:01:43.458 --> 00:01:45.189
Simone Bianco: As many of you know,

00:01:45.223 --> 00:01:48.228
since 1950, the average
surface temperature of the earth

00:01:48.252 --> 00:01:50.720
has increased by one degree Centigrade

00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:53.891
due to all the carbon dioxide
we are pumping into the air.

00:01:54.784 --> 00:01:58.514
Now, while this temperature increase
may not seem like a big deal to us,

00:01:58.538 --> 00:01:59.926
it is to plankton.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.379
Indirect measurements have shown
that the global phytoplankton population

00:02:04.403 --> 00:02:09.465
may have decreased by as much
as 40 percent between 1950 and 2010

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.006
because of climate change.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.686
And you see, this is a problem

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.172
also because it's starving
the fish that eat them.

00:02:16.196 --> 00:02:18.514
And about a billion people
around the world

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:22.505
depend on fish as their primary source
of protein from animals.

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.426
So you see, this isn't just
about breathing.

00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:27.973
No plankton means no fish.

00:02:27.997 --> 00:02:30.458
And that is a lot of food
we will need to replace.

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:33.331
There's something else
that is interesting.

00:02:33.355 --> 00:02:35.458
The bodies of plankton's ancestors

00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:38.377
actually make up a for lot
of the carbon we burn today.

00:02:38.883 --> 00:02:41.006
Which is kind of ironic, if you ask me.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.228
Because the plankton that are here today
clean that carbon out of the air.

00:02:46.252 --> 00:02:48.483
But you see, they don't really
hold a grudge.

00:02:48.507 --> 00:02:50.085
(Laughter)

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.578
The problem is they cannot keep up

00:02:52.602 --> 00:02:56.302
with the tremendous amount
of carbon we are dumping into the air.

00:02:57.093 --> 00:02:58.760
So what does all of this mean?

00:02:58.784 --> 00:03:01.148
Well, it means
that our big carbon footprint

00:03:01.172 --> 00:03:04.446
is crushing the very creatures
that sustain us.

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:06.149
And yes, like Tom said,

00:03:06.173 --> 00:03:09.164
killing almost half of the creatures
that allow us to breathe

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:10.655
is a really big deal.

00:03:11.307 --> 00:03:13.291
So you're probably asking yourself:

00:03:13.315 --> 00:03:15.384
Why aren't we doing something about it?

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:19.326
Our theory is that plankton are tiny,

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.588
and it's really, really hard to care
about something you cannot see.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.664
You see, there's a quote I really like
in "The Little Prince" that goes,

00:03:26.688 --> 00:03:29.212
"What is essential
is invisible to the eye."

00:03:29.236 --> 00:03:32.459
We really believe
that if more people could come

00:03:32.483 --> 00:03:36.838
face to ... cilia with plankton,

00:03:36.862 --> 00:03:39.395
there is a greater chance
we could all rally together

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.594
and save these creatures

00:03:40.618 --> 00:03:42.799
that are so important
to life on our planet.

00:03:42.823 --> 00:03:44.355
TZ: Exactly, Simone.

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:45.926
So to do this,

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.378
we're going to bring you
scuba diving with plankton.

00:03:51.013 --> 00:03:54.641
But I just need to shrink you
by a factor of 1000,

00:03:54.665 --> 00:03:59.110
to a scale where the diameter
of a human hair is as big as my hand.

00:03:59.657 --> 00:04:02.815
And I happen to have invented
a machine to do just that.

00:04:03.292 --> 00:04:06.609
SB: Anyone here remember
"Fantastic Voyage"

00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:08.029
or "Innerspace?"

00:04:08.387 --> 00:04:09.538
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:09.562 --> 00:04:13.426
Martin Short is one of my all-time
favorite actors.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.228
And now this -- this is just like that.

00:04:16.641 --> 00:04:17.832
TZ: Indeed, yes.

00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:19.886
When I was a boy,
I saw "Fantastic Voyage,"

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.114
and I really loved how I could travel
through the bloodstream

00:04:23.138 --> 00:04:26.125
and see biology work on a cellular level.

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:28.482
I've always been inspired
by science fiction.

00:04:28.815 --> 00:04:32.349
As an inventor, I try
and turn fantasy into reality.

00:04:32.966 --> 00:04:35.648
And I once invented this glove

00:04:35.672 --> 00:04:40.268
which let me travel and help
people like you explore the virtual world.

00:04:40.292 --> 00:04:42.133
So now I've invented this machine

00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:45.077
to let us explore the microscopic world.

00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:47.061
It's not virtual, it's real.

00:04:47.085 --> 00:04:48.752
Just really, really tiny.

00:04:49.203 --> 00:04:52.156
It's based on the microscope
that got Simone's attention.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.585
So, here's how it works.

00:04:54.434 --> 00:04:56.370
I have an image sensor

00:04:56.394 --> 00:04:59.164
like the kind in your cell phone,
behind the lens.

00:04:59.188 --> 00:05:01.656
And then I have a little tray
of plankton water

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.428
like you might find from a river

00:05:03.452 --> 00:05:05.887
or my fish tank, which I never
change the water on.

00:05:05.911 --> 00:05:07.101
(Laughter)

00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:08.300
Because I love plankton.

00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:11.848
(Laughter)

00:05:11.872 --> 00:05:14.998
And underneath I have a light, an LED,

00:05:15.022 --> 00:05:19.420
which is going to cast shadows
of the plankton on the image sensor.

00:05:19.887 --> 00:05:22.593
And now this silver thing
is an XY plotter,

00:05:22.617 --> 00:05:26.628
so I can move the image sensor
to follow the plankton as they swim.

00:05:27.752 --> 00:05:30.461
Now comes the fantasy part.

00:05:30.485 --> 00:05:31.730
(Laughter)

00:05:32.141 --> 00:05:35.561
I put a tilt sensor on this helmet

00:05:35.585 --> 00:05:38.652
so I can control
the microscope with my head.

00:05:39.871 --> 00:05:43.640
And now let's look at the video
from this image sensor.

00:05:44.466 --> 00:05:46.537
These are all plankton.

00:05:46.561 --> 00:05:48.482
This is in that little tray,

00:05:48.506 --> 00:05:52.894
and with my head,
I can move the microscope.

00:05:53.212 --> 00:05:56.291
So now we're ready
to go scuba diving with plankton.

00:05:56.807 --> 00:05:59.117
My head will be the navigator,

00:05:59.141 --> 00:06:01.029
and Simone will be our tour guide.

00:06:01.053 --> 00:06:02.204
SB: Yes.

00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:03.229
(Laughter)

00:06:03.253 --> 00:06:07.704
So welcome all to the wonderful world
of life in a drop of water.

00:06:07.728 --> 00:06:09.033
Actually, as you can see,

00:06:09.057 --> 00:06:12.786
with this instrument, we are not
at all limited to a single drop.

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:14.725
Alright, let's find something.

00:06:15.178 --> 00:06:18.320
The little creatures you see
in the center of your screen,

00:06:18.344 --> 00:06:19.836
they are called rotifer.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.418
They are the garbage collectors
of our waters.

00:06:22.442 --> 00:06:24.498
They break down organic matter

00:06:24.522 --> 00:06:26.966
and allow it to be reclaimed
by the environment.

00:06:27.347 --> 00:06:30.403
Now, you know,
nature is an amazing recycler.

00:06:30.427 --> 00:06:34.950
Structures are continuously built,
they are decomposed and recycled,

00:06:34.974 --> 00:06:36.997
and all of that is powered
by solar energy.

00:06:37.403 --> 00:06:38.569
But just think.

00:06:38.593 --> 00:06:42.585
Think about what will happen
if, you know, our garbage collectors

00:06:42.609 --> 00:06:45.039
didn't come anymore, if they disappeared.

00:06:45.362 --> 00:06:47.505
Something else?
Let's look for something else.

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:48.689
Oh, look at that.

00:06:48.713 --> 00:06:52.102
You see the big
ice-cream-cone-shaped things?

00:06:52.126 --> 00:06:55.926
Those are called Stentor,
those are amazing creatures.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.696
You know, they are big,
but they are a single cell.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.910
You remember the rotifer we just met?

00:07:00.934 --> 00:07:04.268
That's about half a millimeter,
it's about 1,000 cells --

00:07:04.292 --> 00:07:08.395
it's typically 15 for the brain,
15 for the stomach

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:10.609
and you know, about the same
for reproduction,

00:07:10.633 --> 00:07:13.196
which is kind of the right mix,
if you ask me.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.221
(Laughter)

00:07:14.245 --> 00:07:16.092
But ... right?

00:07:16.116 --> 00:07:17.279
TZ: I agree.

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:19.553
SB: But a Stentor is only a single cell.

00:07:19.577 --> 00:07:22.268
And it's able to sense
and react to its environment.

00:07:22.292 --> 00:07:25.188
You see, it will swim forward
when it's happy;

00:07:25.212 --> 00:07:28.276
it will swim backward when it's trying
to get away from something

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.322
like, you know, a toxic chemical.

00:07:30.713 --> 00:07:33.609
With our friends in the Center
for Cellular Construction

00:07:33.633 --> 00:07:36.069
and the help of the National
Science Foundation,

00:07:36.093 --> 00:07:40.641
we are using Stentor to sense the presence
of contamination in food and water,

00:07:40.665 --> 00:07:42.355
which I think is really cool.

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:43.783
Alright, last one.

00:07:43.807 --> 00:07:47.503
So the dots that you see there
that are, let's say, behind everything,

00:07:47.527 --> 00:07:48.712
they're algae.

00:07:48.736 --> 00:07:53.410
They are the creatures that provide
the majority of oxygen in the air.

00:07:53.434 --> 00:07:56.363
They convert solar light
and carbon dioxide

00:07:56.387 --> 00:07:59.188
into the oxygen that is filling
your lungs right now.

00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:01.141
So you see, we all got algae breath.

00:08:01.165 --> 00:08:02.316
TZ: (Exhales)

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.934
SB: Yay! (Laughter)

00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.871
You know, there's something interesting.

00:08:05.895 --> 00:08:10.934
About a billion years ago, ancient plants
got their photosynthesis capability

00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:14.671
by incorporating tiny,
tiny plankton into their cells.

00:08:14.695 --> 00:08:19.188
That's exactly like us putting
solar panels on top of our roofs.

00:08:19.212 --> 00:08:23.617
So you see, the microscopic world
is even more amazing than science fiction.

00:08:23.641 --> 00:08:24.799
TZ: Oh, indeed.

00:08:24.823 --> 00:08:28.498
So now you've seen
how vital plankton are to our lives

00:08:28.522 --> 00:08:29.982
and how much we need them.

00:08:30.418 --> 00:08:33.228
If we kill the plankton, we will die

00:08:33.252 --> 00:08:36.220
of asphyxiation or starvation,
take your pick.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.473
Oh, yes, I know it's sad, yes.

00:08:39.497 --> 00:08:40.926
(Laughter)

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.862
In the game of plankton,
you win or you die.

00:08:44.886 --> 00:08:47.862
(Laughter)

00:08:47.886 --> 00:08:53.268
Now, what amazes me is,
we have known about global warming

00:08:53.292 --> 00:08:55.227
for over a century.

00:08:55.251 --> 00:08:57.949
Ever since the Swedish
scientist, Arrhenius,

00:08:57.973 --> 00:09:00.617
calculated the effect
of burning fossil fuel

00:09:00.641 --> 00:09:02.275
on the earth's temperature.

00:09:02.299 --> 00:09:06.433
We've known about this for a long time,
but it's not too late if we act now.

00:09:07.211 --> 00:09:11.450
Yes, yes, I know, I know,
our world is based on fossil fuels,

00:09:11.474 --> 00:09:16.045
but we can adjust our society
to run on renewable energy from the Sun

00:09:16.069 --> 00:09:18.664
to create a more sustainable
and secure future.

00:09:19.093 --> 00:09:21.808
That's good for the little creatures
here, the plankton,

00:09:21.832 --> 00:09:24.032
and that good for us -- here's why.

00:09:25.077 --> 00:09:28.744
The three greatest concerns
of people all around the globe

00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:31.672
typically are jobs, violence and health.

00:09:32.379 --> 00:09:34.312
A job means food and shelter.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.926
Look at these creatures,
they're swimming around,

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.601
they're looking for a place
to eat and reproduce.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.918
If a single cell is programmed to do that,

00:09:42.942 --> 00:09:46.774
it's no surprise that 30 trillion cells
have the same agenda.

00:09:48.053 --> 00:09:49.203
Violence.

00:09:49.625 --> 00:09:53.781
Dependence on fossil fuels
makes a country vulnerable.

00:09:54.195 --> 00:09:59.448
Which leads to conflicts
all around the oil resources.

00:10:00.085 --> 00:10:03.903
Solar energy, on the other hand,
is distributed around the whole globe,

00:10:03.927 --> 00:10:06.572
and no one can blockade the sun.

00:10:06.596 --> 00:10:07.966
(Laughter)

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:09.682
And then, finally, health.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:13.367
Fossil fuels are like a global cigarette.

00:10:13.773 --> 00:10:17.066
And in my opinion,
coal is like an unfiltered type.

00:10:18.305 --> 00:10:22.879
Now, just like smoking,
the best time to quit is when?

00:10:22.903 --> 00:10:24.069
Audience: Now.

00:10:24.093 --> 00:10:25.958
TZ: Now! Not when you get lung cancer.

00:10:26.513 --> 00:10:32.047
Now I know if you look around,
some people may abandon facts and reason.

00:10:32.458 --> 00:10:34.157
Only until suffering --

00:10:34.181 --> 00:10:35.182
(Laughter)

00:10:35.206 --> 00:10:38.053
Yes, they will abandon facts and reason.

00:10:38.077 --> 00:10:43.330
But suffering will eventually
and inevitably force change.

00:10:43.354 --> 00:10:47.719
But let's instead use
our neocortex, our new brain,

00:10:47.743 --> 00:10:50.822
to save the Elders, some of the oldest
creatures on the earth.

00:10:50.846 --> 00:10:54.799
And let's apply science
to harness the energy

00:10:54.823 --> 00:10:58.352
that has fueled the Elders
for millions of years --

00:10:59.649 --> 00:11:01.032
the sun.

00:11:01.056 --> 00:11:02.214
Thank you.

00:11:02.238 --> 00:11:05.087
(Applause)
