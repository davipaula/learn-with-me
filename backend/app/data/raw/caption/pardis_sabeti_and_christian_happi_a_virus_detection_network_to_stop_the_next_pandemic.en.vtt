00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:13.753
[In January 2020,

00:00:13.777 --> 00:00:16.809
Christian Happi and Pardis Sabeti
presented an Audacious idea]

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:23.242
[Sentinel: An early warning system
to detect and track the next pandemic]

00:00:25.223 --> 00:00:26.984
[Here's how it would work ...]

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:35.080
Christian Happi: Sentinel is a proactive
early warning system to preempt pandemics.

00:00:35.104 --> 00:00:37.500
It is built on three major pillars.

00:00:37.524 --> 00:00:39.552
Pardis Sabeti: The first pillar is Detect.

00:00:39.576 --> 00:00:42.557
Christian and I have been studying
infectious diseases together

00:00:42.581 --> 00:00:44.545
around the world for two decades.

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:46.773
We have been using genome sequencing.

00:00:46.797 --> 00:00:49.734
Reading out the complete
genetic information of a microbe,

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:54.095
it allows us to identify viruses,
even those we've never seen before,

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:55.520
track them as they spread

00:00:55.544 --> 00:00:57.428
and watch for new mutations.

00:00:57.452 --> 00:01:00.749
And now with the powerful
gene-editing technology CRISPR,

00:01:00.773 --> 00:01:02.943
we can use this genetic information

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:08.093
to rapidly design exquisitely sensitive
diagnostic tests for any microbe.

00:01:08.557 --> 00:01:11.076
CH: One of these tools is called SHERLOCK.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.467
It can be used to test known viruses
on simple paper strips.

00:01:16.885 --> 00:01:18.596
It is very inexpensive,

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.634
and frontline health workers
can use SHERLOCK

00:01:21.658 --> 00:01:26.227
to detect the most common
or the most threatening viruses

00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:27.641
within an hour.

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:29.689
PS: The other tool is CARMEN.

00:01:29.713 --> 00:01:34.045
It requires a lab, but it can test
for hundreds of viruses simultaneously.

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:36.777
So hospital lab staff
can test patient samples

00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:38.303
for a broad range of viruses

00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:39.841
within a day.

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:42.556
Our second pillar is Connect.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.016
Connect everyone
and share this information

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.974
across the public health community.

00:01:47.752 --> 00:01:49.093
In most outbreaks,

00:01:49.117 --> 00:01:53.560
hospital staff share case information
through paper, Excel -- if at all.

00:01:54.115 --> 00:01:56.683
This makes tracking an outbreak
through space and time

00:01:56.707 --> 00:01:58.037
and coordinating a response

00:01:58.061 --> 00:01:59.496
extremely difficult.

00:01:59.877 --> 00:02:02.982
So we're developing a cloud-based system
and mobile applications

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:04.985
that connect community health workers,

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.253
clinicians, public health
teams -- everyone --

00:02:08.277 --> 00:02:10.455
and allows them to upload data,

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.215
perform analysis, share insights

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.318
and coordinate a response and action plan

00:02:15.342 --> 00:02:16.840
in real time.

00:02:16.864 --> 00:02:19.887
CH: Our third pillar is Empower.

00:02:20.462 --> 00:02:23.074
An outbreak surveillance
system can only succeed

00:02:23.098 --> 00:02:27.119
if we empower frontline health workers
that are already out there

00:02:27.143 --> 00:02:28.833
taking care of communities.

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:31.037
It requires a lot of training.

00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:33.531
Pardis and I are very much aware of that.

00:02:33.555 --> 00:02:35.422
We've spent the past 10 years

00:02:35.446 --> 00:02:39.413
training hundreds of young
African scientists and clinicians.

00:02:39.437 --> 00:02:43.547
Over the next five years, we will train
an additional 1,000 health workers

00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:45.897
to use Sentinel detection tools

00:02:45.921 --> 00:02:48.794
and empower them
to train their colleagues.

00:02:48.818 --> 00:02:52.332
This way, we will improve
the original health care system

00:02:52.356 --> 00:02:56.538
and integrate surveillance
into medical practice.

00:02:57.488 --> 00:03:01.368
[Since presenting their Audacious
plan at TED, the world has changed ...]

00:03:02.773 --> 00:03:05.292
Briar Goldberg: So here we are.
We're recording this.

00:03:05.316 --> 00:03:07.760
It's April 7th, 2020,

00:03:07.784 --> 00:03:12.867
and obviously, we are in the throes
of this crazy global pandemic

00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:14.653
caused by this new coronavirus.

00:03:14.677 --> 00:03:17.611
So you two have been working
together forever,

00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:20.454
and you really came together
pretty aggressively

00:03:20.478 --> 00:03:23.353
with the Ebola crisis back in 2014.

00:03:23.377 --> 00:03:25.573
What does it feel like
from your perspective?

00:03:25.597 --> 00:03:28.964
CH: Pretty much six years
after the Ebola outbreak,

00:03:28.988 --> 00:03:31.076
we're really facing another crisis,

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.028
and we still pretty much, like,
we never learned from the previous crisis.

00:03:37.052 --> 00:03:39.413
And that, really, for me,
is heartbreaking.

00:03:39.437 --> 00:03:46.035
PS: I think that this pandemic
has shown us how unprepared we are

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.227
everywhere in the world.

00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:51.984
Christian and our partners together
had diagnostics at our hospital sites

00:03:52.008 --> 00:03:55.245
in Nigeria, Sierra Leone
and Senegal in early February.

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.789
Most states in the United States
didn't have it until far later.

00:04:00.813 --> 00:04:03.792
It tells us that
we are all in this together,

00:04:03.816 --> 00:04:05.942
and we are all very much behind the curve.

00:04:05.966 --> 00:04:09.874
BG: So, this Sentinel system is amazing,

00:04:09.898 --> 00:04:12.715
but I know that the question
that's on everybody's mind is:

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.767
How is that playing into the here and now?

00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:18.050
PS: You know, we describe Sentinel
as a pandemic preemption system,

00:04:18.074 --> 00:04:19.520
and here we are in a pandemic.

00:04:19.544 --> 00:04:22.328
But what's great is that, actually,
the same tools you need

00:04:22.352 --> 00:04:23.506
to preempt a pandemic

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.639
are the ones that you need
to respond to one.

00:04:25.663 --> 00:04:28.728
And so all of the technologies
that we have laid out --

00:04:28.752 --> 00:04:31.377
the point-of-care testing,
the multiplex testing,

00:04:31.401 --> 00:04:34.811
the discovery and tracking
of the virus as it's changing,

00:04:34.835 --> 00:04:38.235
and the overlay of the mobile
applications to dashboard --

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.418
are all critical.

00:04:39.442 --> 00:04:41.574
CH: For us, it is a war.

00:04:41.598 --> 00:04:44.939
We are basically committed
for 24 hours' turnaround time

00:04:44.963 --> 00:04:46.908
in order to give results,

00:04:46.932 --> 00:04:51.119
and that requires for us
to work around the clock nonstop.

00:04:51.143 --> 00:04:53.352
So it's a pretty challenging moment.

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:54.550
We are away from family.

00:04:54.574 --> 00:04:56.950
At least I have the privilege
to see family today,

00:04:56.974 --> 00:04:59.934
and then I'm sure tomorrow
I'm heading back in the trenches.

00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.122
In my lab, we sequenced
the first COVID-19 genome

00:05:03.146 --> 00:05:04.385
on the African continent,

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:06.440
and that really was done within 48 hours.

00:05:06.464 --> 00:05:09.531
This is revolutionary
coming from Africa

00:05:09.555 --> 00:05:13.110
and then making this information
available for the global health community

00:05:13.134 --> 00:05:15.372
to see what the virus
within Africa looks like.

00:05:15.396 --> 00:05:18.052
I believe that with
technologies and knowledge

00:05:18.076 --> 00:05:20.185
and then sharing information,

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:22.377
we can do better and then we can overcome.

00:05:22.401 --> 00:05:24.523
PS: The whole idea of Sentinel

00:05:24.547 --> 00:05:26.695
is that we all stand guard
over each other.

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:27.875
We all watch.

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:29.359
Each one of us is a sentinel.

00:05:29.383 --> 00:05:33.292
Each one of us, being able to monitor
what is making us sick,

00:05:33.316 --> 00:05:35.917
can share that with
the rest of our community.

00:05:35.941 --> 00:05:38.966
And I think that is what
I profoundly want,

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.295
is for us to all stand guard

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.855
and watch over each other.
