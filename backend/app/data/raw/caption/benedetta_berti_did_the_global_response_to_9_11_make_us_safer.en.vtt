00:00:13.404 --> 00:00:16.680
Almost 20 years have passed since 9/11.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.336
It is time to take stock of where we stand

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.800
and stop and think.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.096
It is time to ask ourselves,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.256
have the assumptions and policies

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.576
we developed in the wake
of those tragic events

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.080
truly made us more secure?

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.416
Have they made our societies,
both in Europe and in the United States,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.640
more resilient?

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.735
I've worked all my life
in the field of security and defense,

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:47.976
and I am convinced
that now, more than ever,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.416
we need to radically reframe
the way we think and act about security,

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.960
and especially
about international security.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.616
By international security,
I actually mean what we do,

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.976
how we prepare our countries

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.496
to better respond
and prevent external threats,

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.440
and how we protect our citizens.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.456
The key to both

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.136
is to focus on protecting civilians,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.776
both in our own countries

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.720
and in those where we are present
in the name of security.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.936
Now, this idea goes
against the fixed narrative

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.696
that we developed over the past 20 years

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.400
over what security is and how to get it,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.480
but that narrative is flawed,
and worse, it is counterproductive.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.696
Over the past 20 years,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.496
both in the United States and in Europe,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.336
we've come to accept that we must
talk about security in zero sum terms,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.896
as if the only way to gain more security
is by compromising on values and rights:

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.016
security versus human rights,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.976
safety versus freedom and development.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.496
This is a false opposition.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.216
It just doesn't work like that.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.056
We need to recognize

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.896
that security and human rights
are not opposite values,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.120
they are intrinsically related.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.416
After all, the most basic human right

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.776
is the right to live
and to be free from violence,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.816
and a state's most basic responsibility

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.199
is to guarantee that right
for its citizens.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.136
Conversely, if we think
about communities all over the world

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.856
affected by war and conflict,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.216
it is insecurity and violence

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.656
that stops them from achieving
their full freedom and development.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.696
Now, they need basic security
just as much as we do

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.056
and they need it
so they can live a normal life

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.936
and so that they can
enjoy their human rights.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.136
This is why we need to shift.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.016
We need to acknowledge
that sustainable security

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.856
builds on a foundation of human rights,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.240
builds on promoting
and respecting human rights.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.936
Also, over the past two decades,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.176
we have accepted that the best way
to guarantee our own security

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.056
is by defeating our enemies,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.080
and to do that, we need to rely
almost exclusively on the military.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.696
Again, this clashes with my work,
with my research,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.101
with what I see in the field.

00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:20.736
What I see is that building
sustainable security

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.296
has a lot less to do
with crushing enemies,

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.936
has a lot less to do
with winning on the battlefield,

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.536
and has a lot more to do
with protecting victims

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.960
and building stability.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.256
And to do that, well, the military alone

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.920
is simply insufficient.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.056
This is why I believe we need to shelve
the never-ending War on Terror,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.656
and we need to replace it
with a security agenda

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.616
that is driven by the principle
of protecting civilians,

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.056
no matter where they are from,
what passport they hold,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.696
or where they live:

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.096
Vancouver, New York,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.720
Kabul, Mosul, Aleppo or Douma.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.936
Sustainable security tells us
that we're more likely

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.776
to have long-term security
at home for ourselves

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.936
if we focus our engagements abroad
on protecting civilians

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.696
and on ensuring their lives are lived
in dignity and free from violence.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.976
For example, we all know
that defeating ISIS

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.776
is a security achievement.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.096
Absolutely.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.496
But rebuilding destroyed homes,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.456
restoring order,

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.656
ensuring a representative
political system,

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.656
these are just as, if not more important,

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.216
and not just for the security
of civilians in Iraq and in Syria,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.600
but for our own security
and for global stability.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.520
More fundamentally,

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.176
ISIS's danger should not just be counted
in the number of weapons it holds

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.656
but also in the number of children
it has kept out of school

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.120
or indoctrinated.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.336
This is from a security perspective.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.976
From a security perspective,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.016
the long-term generational impact
of having millions of children in Syria

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.496
growing up knowing only war
and out of school,

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.816
this is a far more dangerous
threat to stability

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.656
than all of ISIS's weapons combined,

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.816
and we should spend just as much time
and just as much energy to counter this

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.080
as what we spend
when countering ISIS militarily.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.336
Over the past two decades,
our security policy has been short-term.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.936
It has focused on the here and now.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.296
It has systematically downplayed
the link between what we do today

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.816
in the name of security

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.736
and the long-term impact of those choices.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.936
In the years after 9/11,

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.016
some of the choices,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.456
some of the policies we've implemented

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.040
have probably made us less,
not more secure in the long term.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.056
Sustainable, civilian-centered security

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.376
needs to look at what happens
in the long term.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.680
Again, for example,

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.536
relying on drones to target enemies
in faraway countries may be a tool.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.776
It may be a tool to make sure
or to lessen the threat

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.816
of an imminent attack
on the United States.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.216
But what about the long-term impact?

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.496
If civilians are killed,

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.296
if communities are targeted,

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.416
this will feed a vicious circle

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.496
of war, conflict,
trauma and radicalization,

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.216
and that vicious circle is at the center
of so many of the security challenges

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.440
we face today.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.520
This will not make us safer
in the long term.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.216
We need civilian security,

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.896
we need sustainable
civilian-centered security,

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.456
and we need it now.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.136
We need to encourage thinking
and research around this concept,

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.640
and to implement it.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.296
We live in a dangerous world.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.160
We have many threats
to peace and conflict.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.896
Much like in the days after 9/11,

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.760
we simply cannot afford
not to think about international security.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.456
But we have to learn the lessons
of the past 20 years.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.296
To get it right, to get security right,

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.536
we need to focus on the long term.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.976
We need to focus on protecting civilians.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.656
And we need to respect
and acknowledge the fact

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.040
that sustainable security
builds on a foundation of human rights.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.416
Otherwise, in the name of security,

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.176
we risk leaving the world

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.656
a far more dangerous and unstable place

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.600
than what we already found it in.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.096
Thank you.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.720
(Applause)
