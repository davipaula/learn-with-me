00:00:14.417 --> 00:00:15.684
I live in Utah,

00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:18.559
a place known for having
some of the most awe-inspiring

00:00:18.583 --> 00:00:21.143
natural landscapes on this planet.

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:24.643
It's easy to be overwhelmed
by these amazing views,

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:28.518
and to be really fascinated by these
sometimes alien-looking formations.

00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:32.184
As a scientist, I love
observing the natural world.

00:00:32.208 --> 00:00:33.976
But as a cell biologist,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.809
I'm much more interested
in understanding the natural world

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:39.042
at a much, much smaller scale.

00:00:39.917 --> 00:00:42.726
I'm a molecular animator,
and I work with other researchers

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.643
to create visualizations
of molecules that are so small,

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:47.268
they're essentially invisible.

00:00:47.292 --> 00:00:50.143
These molecules are smaller
than the wavelength of light,

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:52.406
which means that we can
never see them directly,

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.476
even with the best light microscopes.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.643
So how do I create
visualizations of things

00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:58.643
that are so small we can't see them?

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:00.809
Scientists, like my collaborators,

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:02.934
can spend their entire
professional careers

00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.518
working to understand
one molecular process.

00:01:05.542 --> 00:01:08.018
To do this, they carry out
a series of experiments

00:01:08.042 --> 00:01:11.143
that each can tell us
a small piece of the puzzle.

00:01:11.167 --> 00:01:13.934
One kind of experiment
can tell us about the protein shape,

00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:15.226
while another can tell us

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.536
about what other proteins
it might interact with,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.465
and another can tell us
about where it can be found in a cell.

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:24.476
And all of these bits of information
can be used to come up with a hypothesis,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.583
a story, essentially,
of how a molecule might work.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.934
My job is to take these ideas
and turn them into an animation.

00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.226
This can be tricky,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.476
because it turns out that molecules
can do some pretty crazy things.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.851
But these animations
can be incredibly useful for researchers

00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:43.976
to communicate their ideas
of how these molecules work.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.768
They can also allow us
to see the molecular world

00:01:46.792 --> 00:01:48.351
through their eyes.

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:50.309
I'd like to show you some animations,

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:53.851
a brief tour of what I consider to be
some of the natural wonders

00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:55.559
of the molecular world.

00:01:55.583 --> 00:01:57.559
First off, this is an immune cell.

00:01:57.583 --> 00:02:00.476
These kinds of cells need to go
crawling around in our bodies

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.518
in order to find invaders
like pathogenic bacteria.

00:02:03.542 --> 00:02:06.643
This movement is powered
by one of my favorite proteins

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:07.934
called actin,

00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.434
which is part of what's known
as the cytoskeleton.

00:02:10.458 --> 00:02:12.101
Unlike our skeletons,

00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:15.851
actin filaments are constantly
being built and taken apart.

00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:19.268
The actin cytoskeleton plays
incredibly important roles in our cells.

00:02:19.292 --> 00:02:21.059
They allow them to change shape,

00:02:21.083 --> 00:02:23.476
to move around, to adhere to surfaces

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.934
and also to gobble up bacteria.

00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.559
Actin is also involved
in a different kind of movement.

00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:31.768
In our muscle cells, actin structures
form these regular filaments

00:02:31.792 --> 00:02:33.309
that look kind of like fabric.

00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:36.268
When our muscles contract,
these filaments are pulled together

00:02:36.292 --> 00:02:38.309
and they go back
to their original position

00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:39.809
when our muscles relax.

00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:43.059
Other parts of the cytoskeleton,
in this case microtubules,

00:02:43.083 --> 00:02:45.768
are responsible for long-range
transportation.

00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:48.434
They can be thought of
as basically cellular highways

00:02:48.458 --> 00:02:51.809
that are used to move things
from one side of the cell to the other.

00:02:51.833 --> 00:02:54.601
Unlike our roads,
microtubules grow and shrink,

00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:56.059
appearing when they're needed

00:02:56.083 --> 00:02:58.434
and disappearing when their job is done.

00:02:58.458 --> 00:03:00.893
The molecular version of semitrucks

00:03:00.917 --> 00:03:03.476
are proteins aptly named motor proteins,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.976
that can walk along microtubules,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.684
dragging sometimes huge cargoes,

00:03:08.708 --> 00:03:10.518
like organelles, behind them.

00:03:10.542 --> 00:03:13.393
This particular motor protein
is known as dynein,

00:03:13.417 --> 00:03:15.851
and its known to be able
to work together in groups

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:19.309
that almost look, at least to me,
like a chariot of horses.

00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:23.184
As you see, the cell is this incredibly
changing, dynamic place,

00:03:23.208 --> 00:03:26.643
where things are constantly
being built and disassembled.

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:28.018
But some of these structures

00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:30.143
are harder to take apart
than others, though.

00:03:30.167 --> 00:03:32.101
And special forces need to be brought in

00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:35.559
in order to make sure that structures
are taken apart in a timely manner.

00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:38.309
That job is done in part
by proteins like these.

00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:39.851
These donut-shaped proteins,

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:41.893
of which there are many types in the cell,

00:03:41.917 --> 00:03:43.976
all seem to act to rip apart structures

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.393
by basically pulling individual proteins
through a central hole.

00:03:47.417 --> 00:03:49.976
When these kinds of proteins
don't work properly,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.726
the types of proteins
that are supposed to get taken apart

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.184
can sometimes stick together and aggregate

00:03:55.208 --> 00:03:59.393
and that can give rise
to terrible diseases, such as Alzheimer's.

00:03:59.417 --> 00:04:01.434
And now let's take a look at the nucleus,

00:04:01.458 --> 00:04:04.393
which houses our genome
in the form of DNA.

00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:05.851
In all of our cells,

00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:10.184
our DNA is cared for and maintained
by a diverse set of proteins.

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:13.018
DNA is wound around proteins
called histones,

00:04:13.042 --> 00:04:17.351
which enable cells to pack
large amounts of DNA into our nucleus.

00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:20.434
These machines
are called chromatin remodelers,

00:04:20.458 --> 00:04:23.184
and the way they work
is that they basically scoot the DNA

00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:24.476
around these histones

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.351
and they allow new pieces of DNA
to become exposed.

00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:31.309
This DNA can then be recognized
by other machinery.

00:04:31.333 --> 00:04:33.851
In this case, this large molecular machine

00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:35.559
is looking for a segment of DNA

00:04:35.583 --> 00:04:37.893
that tells it it's
at the beginning of a gene.

00:04:37.917 --> 00:04:39.601
Once it finds a segment,

00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:42.393
it basically undergoes
a series of shape changes

00:04:42.417 --> 00:04:44.518
which enables it to bring in
other machinery

00:04:44.542 --> 00:04:48.684
that in turn allows a gene
to get turned on or transcribed.

00:04:48.708 --> 00:04:51.809
This has to be a very
tightly regulated process,

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:54.601
because turning on the wrong gene
at the wrong time

00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:57.268
can have disastrous consequences.

00:04:57.292 --> 00:05:00.101
Scientists are now able
to use protein machines

00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:01.559
to edit genomes.

00:05:01.583 --> 00:05:04.018
I'm sure all of you have heard of CRISPR.

00:05:04.042 --> 00:05:06.851
CRISPR takes advantage
of a protein known as Cas9,

00:05:06.875 --> 00:05:09.809
which can be engineered
to recognize and cut

00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:12.226
a very specific sequence of DNA.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.518
In this example,

00:05:13.542 --> 00:05:17.518
two Cas9 proteins are being used
to excise a problematic piece of DNA.

00:05:17.542 --> 00:05:21.018
For example, a part of a gene
that may give rise to a disease.

00:05:21.042 --> 00:05:22.519
Cellular machinery is then used

00:05:22.543 --> 00:05:26.059
to basically glue two ends
of the DNA back together.

00:05:26.083 --> 00:05:27.351
As a molecular animator,

00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:30.684
one of my biggest challenges
is visualizing uncertainty.

00:05:30.708 --> 00:05:34.018
All of the animations I've shown to you
represent hypotheses,

00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:36.309
how my collaborators think
a process works,

00:05:36.333 --> 00:05:38.684
based on the best information
that they have.

00:05:38.708 --> 00:05:40.684
But for a lot of molecular processes,

00:05:40.708 --> 00:05:43.684
we're still really at the early stages
of understanding things,

00:05:43.708 --> 00:05:45.018
and there's a lot to learn.

00:05:45.042 --> 00:05:46.309
The truth is

00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:50.292
that these invisible molecular worlds
are vast and largely unexplored.

00:05:51.458 --> 00:05:53.518
To me, these molecular landscapes

00:05:53.542 --> 00:05:56.934
are just as exciting to explore
as a natural world

00:05:56.958 --> 00:05:59.351
that's visible all around us.

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:00.643
Thank you.

00:06:00.667 --> 00:06:03.792
(Applause)
