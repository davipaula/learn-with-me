00:00:17.553 --> 00:00:21.318
These are sequences from a play called
"The Lehman Trilogy,"

00:00:21.342 --> 00:00:26.384
which traces the origins
of Western capitalism

00:00:26.408 --> 00:00:27.827
in three hours,

00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:30.306
with three actors and a piano.

00:00:31.356 --> 00:00:35.185
And my role was to create a stage design

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:38.723
to write a visual language for this work.

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.983
The play describes Atlantic crossings,

00:00:43.007 --> 00:00:44.860
Alabama cotton fields,

00:00:44.884 --> 00:00:47.034
New York skylines,

00:00:47.058 --> 00:00:51.732
and we framed the whole thing
within this single revolving cube,

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.335
a kind of kinetic cinema
through the centuries.

00:00:57.715 --> 00:01:00.318
It's like a musical instrument

00:01:00.342 --> 00:01:02.151
played by three performers.

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.368
And as they step their way
around and through

00:01:06.392 --> 00:01:08.956
the lives of the Lehman brothers,

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.465
we, the audience,

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:15.432
begin to connect
with the simple, human origins

00:01:15.456 --> 00:01:19.666
at the root of the complex
global financial systems

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.809
that we're all still in thrall to today.

00:01:23.462 --> 00:01:27.015
I used to play musical instruments
myself when I was younger.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.348
My favorite was the violin.

00:01:31.227 --> 00:01:33.290
It was this intimate transfer of energy.

00:01:34.044 --> 00:01:37.882
You held this organic sculpture
up to your heart,

00:01:37.906 --> 00:01:40.600
and you poured the energy
of your whole body

00:01:40.624 --> 00:01:45.479
into this little piece of wood,
and heard it translated into music.

00:01:46.088 --> 00:01:49.070
And I was never particularly
good at the violin,

00:01:49.094 --> 00:01:54.278
but I used to sit at the back
of the second violin section

00:01:54.302 --> 00:01:57.014
in the Hastings Youth Orchestra,

00:01:57.038 --> 00:01:58.317
scratching away.

00:01:59.163 --> 00:02:01.872
We were all scratching

00:02:01.896 --> 00:02:06.162
and marveling at this symphonic sound
that we were making

00:02:06.186 --> 00:02:08.283
that was so much
more beautiful and powerful

00:02:08.307 --> 00:02:10.830
than anything we would ever
have managed on our own.

00:02:11.836 --> 00:02:16.331
And now, as I create
large-scale performances,

00:02:16.355 --> 00:02:17.919
I am always working with teams

00:02:17.943 --> 00:02:21.739
that are at least the size
of a symphony orchestra.

00:02:21.763 --> 00:02:24.244
And whether we are creating

00:02:24.268 --> 00:02:28.252
these revolving giant
chess piece time tunnels

00:02:28.276 --> 00:02:30.859
for an opera by Richard Wagner

00:02:30.883 --> 00:02:34.729
or shark tanks and mountains
for Kanye West,

00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:40.508
we're always seeking to create
the most articulate sculpture,

00:02:40.532 --> 00:02:44.279
the most poetic instrument
of communication to an audience.

00:02:44.871 --> 00:02:46.744
When I say poetic,

00:02:47.426 --> 00:02:50.775
I just mean language
at its most condensed,

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.196
like a song lyric,

00:02:53.204 --> 00:02:56.584
a poetic puzzle
to be unlocked and unpacked.

00:02:57.015 --> 00:03:01.672
And when we were preparing
to design Beyoncé's "Formation" tour,

00:03:01.696 --> 00:03:04.069
we looked at all the lyrics,

00:03:04.093 --> 00:03:07.958
and we came across this poem
that Beyoncé wrote.

00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:13.963
"I saw a TV preacher when I was scared,
at four or five about bad dreams

00:03:13.987 --> 00:03:18.456
who promised he'd say a prayer
if I put my hand to the TV.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.654
That's the first time I remember prayer,
an electric current running through me."

00:03:23.678 --> 00:03:28.123
And this TV that transmitted prayer
to Beyoncé as a child

00:03:28.147 --> 00:03:31.343
became this monolithic revolving sculpture

00:03:31.367 --> 00:03:34.670
that broadcast Beyoncé
to the back of the stadium.

00:03:36.003 --> 00:03:39.312
And the stadium is a mass congregation.

00:03:40.795 --> 00:03:43.821
It's a temporary population
of a hundred thousand people

00:03:43.845 --> 00:03:47.198
who have all come there to sing along
with every word together,

00:03:47.222 --> 00:03:52.845
but they've also come there
each seeking one-to-one intimacy

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:54.210
with the performer.

00:03:54.863 --> 00:03:57.976
And we, as we conceive the show,
we have to provide intimacy

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.838
on a grand scale.

00:04:00.705 --> 00:04:02.607
It usually starts with sketches.

00:04:02.631 --> 00:04:07.417
I was drawing
this 60-foot-high, revolving,

00:04:07.441 --> 00:04:10.004
broadcast-quality portrait of the artist,

00:04:11.055 --> 00:04:13.435
and then I tore
the piece of paper in half.

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.278
I split the mask

00:04:15.302 --> 00:04:18.595
to try to access the human
underneath it all.

00:04:19.741 --> 00:04:23.455
And it's one thing to do sketches,
but of course translating from a sketch

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.332
into a tourable revolving
six-story building

00:04:27.356 --> 00:04:31.254
took some exceptional engineers
working around the clock for three months,

00:04:31.278 --> 00:04:34.890
until finally we arrived in Miami

00:04:34.914 --> 00:04:36.919
and opened the show in April 2016.

00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:43.355
(Video: Cheers)

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:45.974
(Music: "Formation," Beyoncé)

00:04:45.998 --> 00:04:49.553
Beyoncé: Y'all haters corny
with that Illuminati mess

00:04:50.387 --> 00:04:53.767
Paparazzi, catch my fly,
and my cocky fresh

00:04:54.244 --> 00:04:57.525
I'm so reckless when I rock
my Givenchy dress

00:04:58.072 --> 00:05:01.620
I'm so possessive so I rock
his Roc necklaces

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.818
My daddy Alabama

00:05:03.842 --> 00:05:05.787
Momma Louisiana

00:05:05.811 --> 00:05:07.962
You mix that negro with that Creole

00:05:07.986 --> 00:05:09.692
make a Texas bama

00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:12.398
(Music ends)

00:05:12.422 --> 00:05:13.946
I call my work --

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:14.971
(Cheers, applause)

00:05:14.995 --> 00:05:16.145
Thank you.

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:17.837
(Cheers, applause)

00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:20.836
I call my work stage sculpture,

00:05:21.836 --> 00:05:26.028
but of course what's really being sculpted
is the experience of the audience,

00:05:26.052 --> 00:05:28.329
and as directors and designers,

00:05:28.353 --> 00:05:29.805
we have to take responsibility

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.472
for every minute
that the audience spend with us.

00:05:33.045 --> 00:05:35.263
We're a bit like pilots

00:05:35.287 --> 00:05:39.548
navigating a flight path
for a hundred thousand passengers.

00:05:40.413 --> 00:05:44.010
And in the case of the Canadian
artist The Weeknd,

00:05:44.034 --> 00:05:46.692
we translated this flight path literally

00:05:46.716 --> 00:05:51.086
into an origami paper folding airplane

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.662
that took off over the heads
of the audience,

00:05:53.686 --> 00:05:56.067
broke apart in mid-flight, complications,

00:05:56.091 --> 00:05:59.669
and then rose out of the ashes restored

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:01.480
at the end of the show.

00:06:01.504 --> 00:06:03.305
And like any flight,

00:06:04.256 --> 00:06:07.472
the most delicate part
is the liftoff, the beginning,

00:06:07.496 --> 00:06:09.363
because when you design a pop concert,

00:06:09.387 --> 00:06:12.375
the prime material
that you're working with

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:16.947
is something that doesn't take trucks
or crew to transport it.

00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:18.461
It doesn't cost anything,

00:06:18.485 --> 00:06:23.914
and yet it fills every atom of air
in the arena, before the show starts.

00:06:23.938 --> 00:06:26.461
It's the audience's anticipation.

00:06:27.786 --> 00:06:30.894
Everyone brings with them
the story of how they came to get there,

00:06:30.918 --> 00:06:32.316
the distances they traveled,

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.743
the months they had to work
to pay for the tickets.

00:06:34.767 --> 00:06:38.248
Sometimes they sleep overnight
outside the arena,

00:06:38.272 --> 00:06:42.974
and our first task is to deliver
for an audience on their anticipation,

00:06:42.998 --> 00:06:46.450
to deliver their first sight
of the performer.

00:06:48.404 --> 00:06:50.341
When I work with men,

00:06:51.032 --> 00:06:55.540
they're quite happy to have their music
transformed into metaphor --

00:06:55.564 --> 00:06:57.484
spaceflights, mountains.

00:06:58.917 --> 00:07:03.806
But with women, we work a lot with masks
and with three-dimensional portraiture,

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.330
because the fans of the female artist

00:07:06.354 --> 00:07:07.917
crave her face.

00:07:09.746 --> 00:07:14.748
And when the audience arrived to see
Adele's first live concert in five years,

00:07:14.772 --> 00:07:17.755
they were met with this image
of her eyes asleep.

00:07:18.964 --> 00:07:20.764
If they listened carefully,

00:07:20.788 --> 00:07:24.819
they would hear her sleeping breath
echoing around the arena,

00:07:24.843 --> 00:07:26.888
waiting to wake up.

00:07:26.912 --> 00:07:28.172
Here's how the show began.

00:07:28.775 --> 00:07:34.291
(Video: Cheers, applause)

00:07:34.315 --> 00:07:35.316
(Music)

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.617
Adele: Hello.

00:07:36.641 --> 00:07:43.373
(Cheers, applause)

00:07:48.062 --> 00:07:50.766
Es Devlin: With U2,
we're navigating the audience

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:55.995
over a terrain that spans three decades
of politics, poetry and music.

00:07:56.949 --> 00:08:00.533
And over many months, meeting
with the band and their creative teams,

00:08:00.557 --> 00:08:02.414
this is the sketch that kept recurring,

00:08:02.438 --> 00:08:04.916
this line, this street,

00:08:06.483 --> 00:08:09.294
the street that connects
the band's past with their present,

00:08:09.318 --> 00:08:13.276
the tightrope that they walk
as activists and artists,

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.966
a walk through cinema

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.875
that allows the band
to become protagonists

00:08:17.899 --> 00:08:19.081
in their own poetry.

00:08:19.105 --> 00:08:22.455
(Music: U2's "Where the Streets
Have No Name")

00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:24.621
Bono: I wanna run

00:08:26.041 --> 00:08:28.788
I want to hide

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:33.677
I wanna tear down the walls

00:08:33.701 --> 00:08:36.732
That hold me inside

00:08:38.593 --> 00:08:41.452
Es Devlin: The end of the show
is like the end of a flight.

00:08:41.476 --> 00:08:42.934
It's an arrival.

00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:47.172
It's a transfer from the stage
out to the audience.

00:08:47.978 --> 00:08:50.321
For the British band Take That,

00:08:50.345 --> 00:08:54.837
we ended the show by sending
an 80-foot high mechanical human figure

00:08:54.861 --> 00:08:57.063
out to the center of the crowd.

00:08:57.087 --> 00:09:04.087
(Music)

00:09:05.546 --> 00:09:08.829
Like many translations
from music to mechanics,

00:09:08.853 --> 00:09:12.133
this one was initially deemed
entirely technically impossible.

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:16.428
The first three engineers
we took it to said no,

00:09:16.452 --> 00:09:18.841
and eventually,
the way that it was achieved

00:09:18.865 --> 00:09:22.530
was by keeping the entire
control system together

00:09:22.554 --> 00:09:24.221
while it toured around the country,

00:09:24.245 --> 00:09:27.123
so we had to fold it up
onto a flatbed truck

00:09:27.147 --> 00:09:29.298
so it could tour around
without coming apart.

00:09:29.322 --> 00:09:32.894
And of course, what this meant
was that the dimension of its head

00:09:32.918 --> 00:09:34.894
was entirely determined

00:09:34.918 --> 00:09:39.711
by the lowest motorway bridge
that it had to travel under on its tour.

00:09:39.735 --> 00:09:42.181
And I have to tell you that it turns out

00:09:42.205 --> 00:09:45.894
there is an unavoidable
and annoyingly low bridge

00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:47.455
low bridge just outside Hamburg.

00:09:47.479 --> 00:09:50.808
(Laughter)

00:09:50.832 --> 00:09:56.799
(Music)

00:09:56.823 --> 00:10:01.831
Another of the most technically complex
pieces that we've worked on

00:10:01.855 --> 00:10:03.532
is the opera "Carmen"

00:10:03.556 --> 00:10:05.894
at Bregenz Festival in Austria.

00:10:07.258 --> 00:10:11.728
We envisaged Carmen's hands rising
out of Lake Constance,

00:10:11.752 --> 00:10:13.845
and throwing this deck
of cards in the air

00:10:13.869 --> 00:10:16.616
and leaving them suspended
between sky and sea.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.790
But this transient gesture,
this flick of the wrists

00:10:20.814 --> 00:10:23.576
had to become a structure
that would be strong enough

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.845
to withstand two Austrian winters.

00:10:27.123 --> 00:10:30.074
So there's an awful lot
that you don't see in this photograph

00:10:30.098 --> 00:10:32.075
that's working really hard.

00:10:32.099 --> 00:10:36.067
It's a lot of ballast and structure
and support around the back,

00:10:36.091 --> 00:10:39.336
and I'm going to show you the photos
that aren't on my website.

00:10:40.075 --> 00:10:42.181
They're photos of the back of a set,

00:10:42.205 --> 00:10:45.670
the part that's not designed
for the audience to see,

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:47.924
however much work it's doing.

00:10:52.185 --> 00:10:54.797
And you know, this is actually the dilemma

00:10:55.962 --> 00:10:58.332
for an artist who is working
as a stage designer,

00:10:58.356 --> 00:11:03.232
because so much of what I make is fake,

00:11:03.256 --> 00:11:04.557
it's an illusion.

00:11:06.073 --> 00:11:10.978
And yet every artist works in pursuit
of communicating something that's true.

00:11:12.033 --> 00:11:15.088
But we are always asking ourselves:

00:11:15.112 --> 00:11:18.073
"Can we communicate truth
using things that are false?"

00:11:20.264 --> 00:11:23.692
And now when I attend
the shows that I've worked on,

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:27.144
I often find I'm the only one
who is not looking at the stage.

00:11:28.404 --> 00:11:33.679
I'm looking at something
that I find equally fascinating,

00:11:33.703 --> 00:11:34.864
and it's the audience.

00:11:34.888 --> 00:11:36.863
(Cheers)

00:11:36.887 --> 00:11:38.784
I mean, where else do you witness this:

00:11:38.808 --> 00:11:39.809
(Cheers)

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:43.459
this many humans, connected, focused,

00:11:43.483 --> 00:11:46.808
undistracted and unfragmented?

00:11:48.573 --> 00:11:51.335
And lately, I've begun to make work
that originates here,

00:11:52.478 --> 00:11:55.057
in the collective voice of the audience.

00:11:56.535 --> 00:11:59.740
"Poem Portraits" is a collective poem.

00:12:00.669 --> 00:12:03.027
It began at the Serpentine
Gallery in London,

00:12:03.051 --> 00:12:08.956
and everybody is invited
to donate one word to a collective poem.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:12.322
And instead of that large
single LED portrait

00:12:12.346 --> 00:12:14.718
that was broadcasting
to the back of the stadium,

00:12:14.742 --> 00:12:17.036
in this case, every member of the audience

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.305
gets to take their own portrait
home with them,

00:12:19.329 --> 00:12:21.791
and it's woven in with the words

00:12:21.815 --> 00:12:24.608
that they've contributed
to the collective poem.

00:12:24.632 --> 00:12:28.592
So they keep a fragment
of an ever-evolving collective work.

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:33.251
And next year, the collective poem
will take architectural form.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:40.846
This is the design for the UK Pavilion
at the World Expo 2020.

00:12:42.569 --> 00:12:43.719
The UK ...

00:12:45.089 --> 00:12:47.731
In my lifetime,
it's never felt this divided.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.209
It's never felt this noisy
with divergent voices.

00:12:53.233 --> 00:12:56.296
And it's never felt this much
in need of places

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.356
where voices might connect and converge.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:02.239
And it's my hope
that this wooden sculpture,

00:13:02.263 --> 00:13:05.169
this wooden instrument,
a bit like that violin I used to play,

00:13:05.193 --> 00:13:10.822
might be a place where people
can play and enter their word

00:13:10.846 --> 00:13:12.423
at one end of the cone,

00:13:12.447 --> 00:13:14.743
emerge at the other end of the building,

00:13:14.767 --> 00:13:19.066
and find that their word has joined
a collective poem, a collective voice.

00:13:20.796 --> 00:13:27.904
(Music)

00:13:34.149 --> 00:13:37.911
These are simple experiments
in machine learning.

00:13:38.769 --> 00:13:44.107
The algorithm that generates
the collective poem is pretty simple.

00:13:44.131 --> 00:13:45.838
It's like predictive text,

00:13:45.862 --> 00:13:51.692
only it's trained on millions of words
written by poets in the 19th century.

00:13:51.716 --> 00:13:56.696
So it's a sort of convergence
of intelligence, past and present,

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.525
organic and inorganic.

00:13:59.547 --> 00:14:02.761
And we were inspired
by the words of Stephen Hawking.

00:14:02.785 --> 00:14:06.396
Towards the end of his life,
he asked quite a simple question:

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:12.719
If we as a species were ever
to come across another advanced life-form,

00:14:12.743 --> 00:14:15.191
an advanced civilization,

00:14:15.215 --> 00:14:16.745
how would we speak to them?

00:14:17.808 --> 00:14:21.499
What collective language
would we speak as a planet?

00:14:23.941 --> 00:14:27.639
The language of light
reaches every audience.

00:14:28.474 --> 00:14:31.157
All of us are touched by it.
None of us can hold it.

00:14:32.514 --> 00:14:38.077
And in the theater, we begin each work
in a dark place, devoid of light.

00:14:38.101 --> 00:14:41.644
We stay up all night focusing the lights,
programming the lights,

00:14:42.812 --> 00:14:45.724
trying to find new ways
to sculpt and carve light.

00:14:47.074 --> 00:14:51.445
(Music)

00:14:51.469 --> 00:14:56.024
This is a portrait of our practice,

00:14:57.494 --> 00:15:01.575
always seeking new ways
to shape and reshape light,

00:15:01.599 --> 00:15:05.821
always finding words for things
that we no longer need to say.

00:15:08.637 --> 00:15:12.408
And I want to say that this,

00:15:13.218 --> 00:15:15.747
and everything that I've just shown you,

00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:18.075
no longer exists in physical form.

00:15:18.099 --> 00:15:20.931
(Music)

00:15:20.955 --> 00:15:23.521
In fact, most of what I've made
over the last 25 years

00:15:23.545 --> 00:15:25.262
doesn't exist anymore.

00:15:25.286 --> 00:15:29.838
But our work endures in memories,
in synaptic sculptures,

00:15:29.862 --> 00:15:33.061
in the minds of those
who were once present

00:15:33.085 --> 00:15:34.505
in the audience.

00:15:34.529 --> 00:15:37.438
(Music)

00:15:37.462 --> 00:15:42.208
I once read that a poem learnt by heart

00:15:43.231 --> 00:15:45.398
is what you have left,

00:15:45.422 --> 00:15:47.530
what can't be lost,

00:15:47.554 --> 00:15:51.686
even if your house burns down
and you've lost all your possessions.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:56.554
I want to end with some lines
that I learnt by heart a long time ago.

00:15:56.578 --> 00:15:59.099
(Music)

00:15:59.123 --> 00:16:02.004
They're written by the English
novelist E.M. Forster,

00:16:02.028 --> 00:16:06.670
in 1910, just a few years
before Europe, my continent,

00:16:06.694 --> 00:16:08.325
(Music)

00:16:08.349 --> 00:16:10.095
began tearing itself apart.

00:16:10.119 --> 00:16:12.017
(Music)

00:16:12.041 --> 00:16:14.882
And his call to convergence
still resonates

00:16:14.906 --> 00:16:17.278
through most of what
we're trying to make now.

00:16:17.302 --> 00:16:18.770
(Music)

00:16:18.794 --> 00:16:23.752
"Only connect! That was
the whole of her sermon.

00:16:23.776 --> 00:16:26.865
Only connect the prose and the passion,

00:16:26.889 --> 00:16:29.890
and both will be exalted,

00:16:29.914 --> 00:16:34.224
And human love will be seen at its height.

00:16:34.248 --> 00:16:39.049
Only connect! And live
in fragments no longer."

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:42.241
Thank you.

00:16:42.265 --> 00:16:49.265
(Applause)
