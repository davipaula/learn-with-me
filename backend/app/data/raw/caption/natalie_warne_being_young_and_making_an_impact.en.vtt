00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.216
My mom is a strong black woman

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.520
who raised her kids to have
the same sense of strength and pride.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.656
This spirit was epitomized
by a single wall

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.136
in our small, two-bedroom apartment
on the South Side of Chicago.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.416
Two pictures hung proudly:

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.536
one larger-than-life photo
of my siblings and I

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.416
and the other a picture of my mom

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.656
at 12 years old

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.400
staring into the eyes
of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.816
When I was younger,
I used to stand on my tippy-toes,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.096
stare at that picture,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.695
close my eyes tightly,
and just pretend that it was me

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.536
gazing up at the man who revolutionized
the Civil Rights Movement,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.336
who marched on Washington
and who transformed a generation

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.840
by his words, "I have a dream."

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.376
But I did get to meet him.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.296
Now, obviously, I didn't meet Dr. King,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.400
but I met a man named Dr. Vincent Harding.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.976
He worked with Dr. King from day one

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.600
and even wrote some of his
most iconic speeches.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.456
You see, this was a really
important moment for me as a kid,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.616
because it was the first time
that I realized

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.136
that it wasn't just Dr. King
who led this revolution,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.519
but he was surrounded by a movement
made up of anonymous extraordinaries.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.216
Anonymous extraordinaries are people
who work selflessly and vigorously

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.496
for what they believe in,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.696
people who are motivated by conviction
and not recognition.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.856
It took me a long time to realize
the significance of this moment,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.136
until I was much older.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.016
And like I said, I grew up in Chicago.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.096
I grew up in a rough, poor neighborhood,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.096
but it didn't really matter to me as kid

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.216
because I literally have
the most incredible family in the world.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.336
Two things that I did
struggle with a lot

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.576
growing up was one --

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.896
that my dad has been sick my whole life.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.416
He suffers from Parkinson's
and pancreatitis,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.736
and as a kid, it was so hard
for me to watch my hero

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.040
in so much pain.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.976
And my other issue was with me.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.200
I guess you could say
I had an identity crisis.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.736
I had to move four times
during high school,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.056
and my freshman year I went
to an extremely racist high school.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.456
Kids were so cruel.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.136
They gave us hate letters,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.976
wrote terrible things on our lockers

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.136
and because I'm biracial,
they would tell me,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.816
"You can't be both.
You have to choose, black or white."

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.056
And in the end
I just resented being either.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.936
And then all of a sudden,
my senior year rolls around, 2008,

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.936
and being mixed, being racially
ambiguous is this new cool fad,

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.176
like, "Natalie, now it's OK
for you to like you. You're pretty now."

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.416
I was over it. I was tired of caring
about what other people thought

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.056
and I just wanted to hurry up,

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.176
go through my classes,
whatever school I was going to be at next,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.456
and graduate.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.576
It wasn't until I was 17

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.696
and I saw a film
called "Invisible Children"

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.960
that something happened.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.736
Child soldiers,

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.056
children as young as my nephews

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.216
being abducted,
given AK-47s and forced to kill,

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.296
not just anyone, but oftentimes
forced to kill their own parents,

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.096
their own siblings --

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.736
a rebel army committing mass murder
for no political or religious reason,

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.960
just because.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.400
25 years.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.896
25 years this conflict has been going on.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.336
I'm 20 years old,

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.840
so that makes this conflict
five years older than me.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.416
One man,

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.056
one man with one charismatic voice,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.656
started this whole thing.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.880
His name is Joseph Kony.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.656
When I saw this film, something happened.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.936
Something started
kind of stirring inside of me,

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.696
and I couldn't identify what it was.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.856
I didn't know if it was rage,
if it was pity,

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.136
if I felt guilty
because this was the first time

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.840
I'd heard about a 25-year-long war.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.416
I couldn't even give it a name.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.186
All I knew is that it kicked me off my ass
and I started asking questions.

00:03:39.196 --> 00:03:42.816
What do I do? What can one 17-year-old do?

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.364
You've got to give me something.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.166
And they gave me something.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.496
The founders and filmmakers
at Invisible Children told me

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.776
that there was this bill,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.816
that if we could
just get this bill passed,

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.616
it would do two things:
one, it would apprehend Joseph Kony

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.616
and the top commanders in his rebel army,

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.816
and two, it would provide funding
for the recovery of these regions

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.936
that had been devastated
by 25 years of war.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.656
And I was like, done. Let me at it.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.160
I swear I will do whatever I can
to make this happen.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.096
So myself and 99 other
idealistic 18- to 20-year-olds

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.200
hopped on a plane to intern
in San Diego with Invisible Children.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.096
I was postponing college.
We weren't getting paid for this

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.296
and you could call it irresponsible
or crazy -- my parents did.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.480
But for us, it would have been
insane not to go.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.375
We all felt this urgency,
and we would do whatever it took

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:31.120
to pass this bill.

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:33.696
So we were given our first task.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.496
We were going to plan an event called
the Rescue of Joseph Kony's Child Soldiers

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.656
where participants would come
in a hundred cities worldwide

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.136
and rally in their city center

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.256
until a celebrity or a political figure

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.176
came and used their voice
on behalf of these child soldiers,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.400
and at that point each city was "rescued."

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.480
But the catch was, we weren't
leaving the cities until we were rescued.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.176
I was given Chicago and nine other cities

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.816
and I told my bosses, I was like,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.296
"If we're going for big-name people,
why not go for the queen bee? Right?

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.776
Why not go for Oprah Winfrey?"

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.576
They thought I was a little idealistic,
but I mean, we were trying to think big.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.256
We were doing an impossible thing,

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.496
so why not try to reach
more impossible things?

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.000
And so we had from January
to April to get this done.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.496
This is the number of hours
that I spent on logistics,

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.896
from getting permits
to rallying participants

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.440
and finding venues.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.216
This is the number of times
that I was rejected

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.880
by celebrities' agents
or politicians' secretaries.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.056
That is amount of money
that I spent personally

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.976
on Red Bull and Diet Coke
to stay awake during this movement.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.216
(Laughter)

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.800
You can judge me if you want to.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.376
That is my hospital bill
from the kidney infection I got

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.816
from an overconsumption of caffeine
due to this event.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.856
(Laughter)

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.576
These were just some
of the ridiculous things that we did

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.136
to try and pull this event off.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.896
And so April 21 rolls around
and the event begins.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.496
A hundred cities around the world.
They were beautiful.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.816
Six days later, all the cities
were rescued but one:

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.416
Chicago.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.816
So we were waiting in the city.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.016
People started coming
from all over the world,

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.993
all over the country to be reinforcements

00:06:08.017 --> 00:06:09.536
and join their voice with ours.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.816
And finally, on May 1,

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.136
we wrapped ourselves around Oprah's studio

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.656
and we got her attention.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.336
This is a clip from a film
called "Together We Are Free"

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.240
documenting the rescue event
and my attempt to get Oprah.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.016
(Video) Oprah Winfrey:
When I drove into the office,

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.136
there was a giant -- when you came in,
was there a group outside?

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.376
Crowd: Yes.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.816
OW: Holding up signs
asking if I would talk to them

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.096
for just five minutes,

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.056
so I was happy to do so.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.336
And they are with a group
called "Invisible Children,"

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.216
and I told this group outside

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.576
that I'd give them a minute
to state their case.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.376
Man: Oprah, thank you
so much for having us.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.056
Basically, these folks out here
have seen the story of 30,000 children

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.776
abducted by a rebel leader
named Joseph Kony.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.496
And they're out here in solidarity,

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.776
and they have been out here for six days.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.656
This started 100,000 people worldwide.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.416
Now it's down to 500 standing strong

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.896
so that you can raise
the profile of this issue

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.136
and we can end the longest-running
war in Africa and rescue those kids

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:15.695
that are child soldiers
still in East Africa.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.976
Oprah, I have to say
this girl Natalie here,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.256
she's 18 years old.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.976
She was an intern for us this year,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.736
and she said, "My one goal
is to get Oprah."

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.456
She had 2,000 people come out on Saturday,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.696
but it rained.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.456
She stood here in the rain with 50 people.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.336
When they heard she was here,
hundreds started coming.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.376
People are here from Mexico, Australia.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.616
Natalie's 18.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.216
Don't think you're too young.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.976
You can change the world any day.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.216
Start now.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.456
Start today.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.960
(Cheers)

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.176
Man: Was it worth it?

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.680
Crowd: Yeah!

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.816
Natalie! Natalie! Natalie!

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.680
(Music)

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.120
Together we are free!
Together we are free!

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.536
(Applause)

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.576
So you would think
that this is the moment in my life,

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.040
the pinnacle that
made me an extraordinary.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.336
And it was an awesome moment.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.016
I mean, I was on top of the world.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.496
Ten million people
watched the "Oprah Winfrey Show."

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.256
But looking back, that wasn't it.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.496
Don't get me wrong.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.136
Like I said, it was great moment.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.256
It made for a heck of a profile picture
on Facebook for a week.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.496
(Laughter)

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.656
But I had been extraordinary all along,

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.880
and I wasn't alone.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.135
You see, even though
my story was featured in this film,

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.856
I was just one of a hundred interns

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.559
who worked their tails off
to make this happen.

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:51.015
I'm up in the air,

00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:53.216
but the guy that I'm sitting
on his shoulders,

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.456
he's my best friend.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.856
His name is Johannes Oberman

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.336
and Johannes worked with me
from day one in Chicago,

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:01.160
just as long hours,
just as many sleepless nights as I did.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.696
The girl on the right,
her name's Bethany Bylsma.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.776
Bethany planned New York City and Boston,

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.120
and they were seriously
the most beautiful events that we held.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.616
The girl on the left, her name's Colleen.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.696
Colleen moved to Mexico,

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.256
moved, for three months,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.896
to plan five events there,

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.216
only to be kicked out
the day before the events

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.720
because of the swine flu.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.096
And then there was this family.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.536
This family, they didn't
get to come to the rescue.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.856
They couldn't make it out,

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.216
but they ordered
a hundred boxes of pizza for us,

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.056
delivered them to the corner
of Michigan and Randolph

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.136
where we were all silently protesting.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.936
You see, it was people like this
doing whatever they could,

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.136
simultaneously, single-mindedly,

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.136
without a care to who was watching,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.856
that made this happen.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.816
It wasn't about us getting on Oprah,

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.976
because when I got down
from their shoulders,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.456
the war hadn't ended.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.736
It was about that bill.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.216
Oprah was just a checkpoint
on the way to that bill.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.496
That bill was the point.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.056
That bill is what we had
our eyes set on from day one.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.856
That was going to help us
end Africa's longest-running war.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.536
And that is what brought
a hundred thousand people

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.720
out to the rescue event
from around the world.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.320
And it paid off:

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.216
10 days after we were on Oprah,

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.200
the bill was introduced into Congress.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.291
A year after that, it got unanimously

00:10:18.316 --> 00:10:21.856
267 cosponsors in Congress.

00:10:21.903 --> 00:10:23.292
And then one week after that,

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.656
President Obama signed our bill into law.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.320
(Applause)

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.056
And none of us interns got to be there.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.056
We didn't get to be there in this moment.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.296
Our founders were there.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.376
They're the guys
cheesing in the background.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.736
But that moment right there
is what made all of it worth it.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.096
It's what a hundred thousand
anonymous extraordinaries

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.720
worked for so hard to make that happen.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.856
You know, the Oprah moments,

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.976
they prove that the supposedly
impossible can be done.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.056
They inspire us.
They boost our confidence.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.376
But the moment isn't a movement.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.696
Even a lot of those moments
strung together don't fuel a movement.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.080
What fuels a movement are
the anonymous extraordinaries behind it.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.816
You know, for me, what kept me
pushing on through the rescue

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.776
was the thought of those child soldiers.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.656
It became personal.
I was able to go to Africa at one point.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.136
I met these incredible people.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.536
I have friends that have been
living in this conflict their entire life,

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.976
and it was personal to me.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.080
But that doesn't have to be
what drives you.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.816
You know, you may want
to be the next Shepard Fairey

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.296
or the next JK Rowling

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.616
or the next whoever.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.816
It doesn't matter, but whatever you want,

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.416
chase after it
with everything that you have --

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.336
not because of the fame or the fortune,

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.536
but solely because
that's what you believe in,

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.576
because that's what makes your heart sing.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.840
That's what your dance is.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.776
That's what is going
to define our generation,

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.856
when we start chasing and fighting
after the things that we love

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.336
and that we want to fight for.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.536
I cared too much in high school
about what people thought about me.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:00.696
That's what so awesome
about this conference,

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.256
is so many of you are so young.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.756
Find that thing that inspires you
that you love, and just chase after it.

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:06.976
You know, fight for that,

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.336
because that is what
is going to change this world

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.936
and that is what defines us.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.296
Despite what people think,

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.976
my Oprah moments,
my being on TED, doesn't define me,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.096
because if you were
to follow me home to LA,

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.016
you would see me waiting tables
and nannying to pay the bills

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.440
as I chase after my dream
of becoming a filmmaker.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.496
In the small, anonymous, monotonous

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.256
every-single-day acts,

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.000
I have to remind myself
to be extraordinary.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.456
And believe me, when the door
is closed and the cameras are off,

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.136
it's tough.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.896
But if there's one thing
that I want to drive home to you,

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.576
one thing that I can say,
not just to you but to myself,

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.096
is that it is the acts
that make us extraordinary,

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.400
not the Oprah moments. Thank you.
