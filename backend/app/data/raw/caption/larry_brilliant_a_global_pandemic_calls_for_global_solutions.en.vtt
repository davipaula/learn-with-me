00:00:12.055 --> 00:00:14.285
Helen Walters: So, Chris, who's up first?

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:18.357
Chris Anderson: Well, we have a man
who's worried about pandemics

00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:20.181
pretty much his whole life.

00:00:20.738 --> 00:00:23.474
He played an absolutely key role,
more than 40 years ago,

00:00:23.498 --> 00:00:27.458
in helping the world get rid
of the scourge of smallpox.

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.474
And in 2006,

00:00:29.498 --> 00:00:32.831
he came to TED to warn the world

00:00:32.855 --> 00:00:36.871
of the dire risk of a global pandemic,

00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:38.440
and what we might do about it.

00:00:38.464 --> 00:00:41.265
So please welcome here
Dr. Larry Brilliant.

00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:43.838
Larry, so good to see you.

00:00:43.862 --> 00:00:46.037
Larry Brilliant: Thank you,
nice to see you.

00:00:46.863 --> 00:00:49.092
CA: Larry, in that talk,

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:51.863
you showed a video clip
that was a simulation

00:00:51.887 --> 00:00:54.578
of what a pandemic might look like.

00:00:54.926 --> 00:00:57.902
I would like to play it --
this gave me chills.

00:00:57.926 --> 00:01:01.728
Larry Brilliant (TED2006):
Let me show you a simulation

00:01:01.752 --> 00:01:04.493
of what a pandemic looks like,

00:01:04.517 --> 00:01:06.496
so we know what we're talking about.

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:10.838
Let's assume, for example,
that the first case occurs in South Asia.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.501
It initially goes quite slowly,

00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:17.192
you get two or three discrete locations.

00:01:18.903 --> 00:01:21.426
Then there will be secondary outbreaks.

00:01:21.942 --> 00:01:25.450
And the disease will spread
from country to country so fast

00:01:25.474 --> 00:01:27.674
that you won't know what hit you.

00:01:28.228 --> 00:01:31.635
Within three weeks,
it will be everywhere in the world.

00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:34.969
Now if we had an undo button,

00:01:34.993 --> 00:01:36.937
and we could go back

00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:39.866
and isolate it and grab it
when it first started,

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.484
if we could find it early
and we had early detection

00:01:42.508 --> 00:01:43.713
and early response,

00:01:43.737 --> 00:01:47.426
and we could put each one
of those viruses in jail,

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.479
that's the only way to deal
with something like a pandemic.

00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:56.297
CA: Larry, that phrase
you mentioned there,

00:01:56.321 --> 00:01:58.273
"early detection," "early response,"

00:01:58.297 --> 00:02:00.283
that was a key theme of that talk,

00:02:00.307 --> 00:02:03.630
you made us all repeat it several times.

00:02:03.654 --> 00:02:07.402
Is that still the key
to preventing a pandemic?

00:02:08.573 --> 00:02:10.851
LB: Oh, surely.

00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:12.740
You know, when you have a pandemic,

00:02:12.764 --> 00:02:16.851
something moving at exponential speed,

00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:20.077
if you miss the first two weeks,
if you're late the first two weeks,

00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:23.553
it's not the deaths and the illness
from the first two weeks you lose,

00:02:23.577 --> 00:02:25.577
it's the two weeks at the peak.

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:29.593
Those are prevented if you act early.

00:02:29.617 --> 00:02:32.220
Early response is critical,

00:02:32.244 --> 00:02:34.822
early detection is a condition precedent.

00:02:36.013 --> 00:02:37.840
CA: And how would you grade the world

00:02:37.864 --> 00:02:41.543
on its early detection,
early response to COVID-19?

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.236
LB: Of course, you gave me
this question earlier,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.029
so I've been thinking a lot about it.

00:02:47.053 --> 00:02:49.014
I think I would go through the countries,

00:02:49.038 --> 00:02:50.911
and I've actually made a list.

00:02:50.935 --> 00:02:56.641
I think the island republics of Taiwan,
Iceland and certainly New Zealand

00:02:56.665 --> 00:02:57.815
would get an A.

00:02:58.284 --> 00:03:01.807
The island republic of the UK
and the United States --

00:03:01.831 --> 00:03:05.545
which is not an island,
no matter how much we may think we are --

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.022
would get a failing grade.

00:03:07.046 --> 00:03:12.220
I'd give a B to South Korea
and to Germany.

00:03:12.244 --> 00:03:13.394
And in between ...

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:17.085
So it's a very heterogeneous
response, I think.

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.974
The world as a whole is faltering.

00:03:19.998 --> 00:03:23.960
We shouldn't be proud
of what's happening right now.

00:03:24.974 --> 00:03:27.752
CA: I mean, we got
the detection pretty early,

00:03:27.776 --> 00:03:31.873
or at least some doctors in China
got the detection pretty early.

00:03:33.048 --> 00:03:36.493
LB: Earlier than the 2002 SARS,
which took six months.

00:03:36.517 --> 00:03:39.164
This took about six weeks.

00:03:39.188 --> 00:03:41.410
And detection means not only finding it,

00:03:41.434 --> 00:03:42.664
but knowing what it is.

00:03:42.688 --> 00:03:46.204
So I would give us
a pretty good score on that.

00:03:46.228 --> 00:03:49.170
The transparency, the communication --
those are other issues.

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.607
CA: So what was the key mistake

00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:57.868
that you think the countries
you gave an F to made?

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.521
LB: I think fear,

00:04:00.545 --> 00:04:04.656
political incompetence, interference,

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.014
not taking it seriously soon enough --

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:09.260
it's pretty human.

00:04:09.284 --> 00:04:10.706
I think throughout history,

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.933
pretty much every pandemic
is first viewed with denial and doubt.

00:04:15.957 --> 00:04:17.823
But those countries that acted quickly,

00:04:17.847 --> 00:04:20.471
and even those who started slow,
like South Korea,

00:04:20.495 --> 00:04:23.709
they could still make up for it,
and they did really well.

00:04:24.204 --> 00:04:27.029
We've had two months that we've lost.

00:04:27.053 --> 00:04:30.989
We've given a virus
that moves exponentially

00:04:31.013 --> 00:04:32.918
a two-month head start.

00:04:32.942 --> 00:04:34.942
That's not a good idea, Chris.

00:04:35.387 --> 00:04:36.609
CA: No, indeed.

00:04:36.633 --> 00:04:39.490
I mean, there's so much
puzzling information still out there

00:04:39.514 --> 00:04:41.618
about this virus.

00:04:41.642 --> 00:04:45.921
What do you think the scientific consensus
is going to likely end up being

00:04:45.945 --> 00:04:47.553
on, like, the two key numbers

00:04:47.577 --> 00:04:51.579
of its infectiousness
and its fatality rate?

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:56.422
LB: So I think the kind of
equation to keep in mind

00:04:56.446 --> 00:05:00.260
is that the virus moves
dependent on three major issues.

00:05:00.284 --> 00:05:02.156
One is the R0,

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.728
the first number of secondary cases
that there are when the virus emerges.

00:05:06.752 --> 00:05:08.736
In this case,

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.073
people talk about it being 2.2, 2.4.

00:05:12.097 --> 00:05:14.819
But a really important paper
three weeks ago,

00:05:14.843 --> 00:05:19.946
in the "Emerging Infectious
Diseases" journal came out,

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.406
suggesting that looking back
on the Wuhan data,

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.136
it's really 5.7.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.359
So for argument's sake,

00:05:25.383 --> 00:05:28.437
let's say that the virus is moving
at exponential speed

00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:32.279
and the exponent
is somewhere between 2.2 and 5.7.

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:34.268
The other two factors that matter

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:37.347
are the incubation period
or the generation time.

00:05:37.371 --> 00:05:38.530
The longer that is,

00:05:38.554 --> 00:05:41.918
the slower the pandemic appears to us.

00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:45.037
When it's really short,
like six days, it moves like lightning.

00:05:45.061 --> 00:05:47.110
And then the last,
and the most important --

00:05:47.134 --> 00:05:48.546
and it's often overlooked --

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.712
is the density of susceptibles.

00:05:50.736 --> 00:05:52.434
This is a novel virus,

00:05:52.458 --> 00:05:56.069
so we want to know how many customers
could it potentially have.

00:05:56.093 --> 00:05:59.244
And as it's novel,
that's eight billion of us.

00:05:59.268 --> 00:06:01.037
The world is facing a virus

00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:04.093
that looks at all of us
like equally susceptible.

00:06:04.117 --> 00:06:06.149
Doesn't matter our color, our race,

00:06:06.173 --> 00:06:07.640
or how wealthy we are.

00:06:09.459 --> 00:06:12.270
CA: I mean, none of the numbers
that you've mentioned so far

00:06:12.294 --> 00:06:17.277
are in themselves different
from any other infections in recent years.

00:06:17.301 --> 00:06:20.441
What is the combination
that has made this so deadly?

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:23.380
LB: Well, it is exactly the combination

00:06:23.404 --> 00:06:27.337
of the short incubation period
and the high transmissibility.

00:06:27.648 --> 00:06:33.585
But you know, everybody on this call
has known somebody who has the disease.

00:06:33.609 --> 00:06:36.982
Sadly, many have lost a loved one.

00:06:37.006 --> 00:06:40.602
This is a terrible disease
when it is serious.

00:06:40.626 --> 00:06:43.891
And I get calls from doctors
in emergency rooms

00:06:43.915 --> 00:06:47.848
and treating people in ICUs
all over the world,

00:06:47.872 --> 00:06:49.410
and they all say the same thing:

00:06:49.434 --> 00:06:53.442
"How do I choose who is going to live
and who is going to die?

00:06:53.466 --> 00:06:56.925
I have so few tools to deal with."

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:58.913
It's a terrifying disease,

00:06:58.937 --> 00:07:02.132
to die alone with a ventilator
in your lungs,

00:07:02.156 --> 00:07:05.211
and it's a disease
that affects all of our organs.

00:07:05.235 --> 00:07:07.283
It's a respiratory disease --

00:07:07.307 --> 00:07:08.680
perhaps misleading.

00:07:08.704 --> 00:07:10.300
Makes you think of a flu.

00:07:10.324 --> 00:07:12.855
But so many of the patients
have blood in their urine

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:14.045
from kidney disease,

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:15.911
they have gastroenteritis,

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:18.847
they certainly have
heart failure very often,

00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:22.864
we know that it affects taste and smell,
the olfactory nerves,

00:07:22.888 --> 00:07:25.283
we know, of course, about the lung.

00:07:25.307 --> 00:07:26.514
The question I have:

00:07:26.538 --> 00:07:29.537
is there any organ
that it does not affect?

00:07:29.887 --> 00:07:31.363
And in that sense,

00:07:31.387 --> 00:07:34.053
it reminds me all too much of smallpox.

00:07:37.061 --> 00:07:38.442
CA: So we're in a mess.

00:07:38.466 --> 00:07:40.666
What's the way forward from here?

00:07:41.625 --> 00:07:43.846
LB: Well, the way forward
is still the same.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:45.125
Rapid detection,

00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:46.768
rapid response.

00:07:46.792 --> 00:07:48.260
Finding every case,

00:07:48.284 --> 00:07:51.434
and then figuring out all the contacts.

00:07:51.458 --> 00:07:53.840
We've got great new technology
for contact tracing,

00:07:53.864 --> 00:07:57.315
we've got amazing scientists
working at the speed of light

00:07:57.339 --> 00:08:00.974
to give us test kits
and antivirals and vaccines.

00:08:00.998 --> 00:08:03.879
We need to slow down,

00:08:03.903 --> 00:08:06.966
the Buddhists say slow down time

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.337
so that you can put your heart,
your soul, into that space.

00:08:10.361 --> 00:08:13.273
We need to slow down
the speed of this virus,

00:08:13.297 --> 00:08:15.480
which is why we do social distancing.

00:08:15.504 --> 00:08:16.654
Just to be clear --

00:08:16.678 --> 00:08:18.997
flattening the curve, social distancing,

00:08:19.021 --> 00:08:22.791
it doesn't change
the absolute number of cases,

00:08:22.815 --> 00:08:26.688
but it changes what could be
a Mount Fuji-like peak

00:08:26.712 --> 00:08:28.165
into a pulse,

00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:32.885
and then we won't also lose people
because of competition for hospital beds,

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:36.823
people who have heart attacks,
need chemotherapy, difficult births,

00:08:36.847 --> 00:08:38.792
can get into the hospital,

00:08:38.816 --> 00:08:41.522
and we can use the scarce
resources we have,

00:08:41.546 --> 00:08:43.514
especially in the developing world,

00:08:43.538 --> 00:08:44.713
to treat people.

00:08:44.737 --> 00:08:46.728
So slow down,

00:08:46.752 --> 00:08:49.141
slow down the speed of the epidemic,

00:08:49.165 --> 00:08:52.720
and then in the troughs, in between waves,

00:08:52.744 --> 00:08:55.766
jump on, double down, step on it,

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.639
and find every case,

00:08:57.663 --> 00:08:58.989
trace every contact,

00:08:59.013 --> 00:09:00.251
test every case,

00:09:00.275 --> 00:09:03.902
and then only quarantine
the ones who need to be quarantined,

00:09:03.926 --> 00:09:06.622
and do that until we have a vaccine.

00:09:08.232 --> 00:09:11.859
CA: So it sounds like we have to get
past the stage of just mitigation,

00:09:11.883 --> 00:09:15.144
where we're just trying
to take a general shutdown,

00:09:15.168 --> 00:09:18.565
to the point where we can start
identifying individual cases again

00:09:18.589 --> 00:09:20.581
and contact-trace for them

00:09:20.605 --> 00:09:22.313
and treat them separately.

00:09:22.337 --> 00:09:23.703
I mean, to do that,

00:09:23.727 --> 00:09:28.020
that seems like it's going to take
a step up of coordination,

00:09:28.044 --> 00:09:31.671
ambition, organization, investment,

00:09:31.695 --> 00:09:35.537
that we're not really seeing
the signs of yet in some countries.

00:09:35.561 --> 00:09:37.918
Can we do this, how can we do this?

00:09:37.942 --> 00:09:39.522
LB: Oh, of course we can do this.

00:09:39.546 --> 00:09:43.053
I mean, Taiwan did it so beautifully,

00:09:43.077 --> 00:09:45.149
Iceland did it so beautifully, Germany,

00:09:45.173 --> 00:09:46.649
all with different strategies,

00:09:46.673 --> 00:09:48.109
South Korea.

00:09:48.133 --> 00:09:51.672
It really requires competent governance,

00:09:51.696 --> 00:09:54.100
a sense of seriousness,

00:09:54.124 --> 00:09:58.671
and listening to the scientists,
not the politicians following the virus.

00:09:58.695 --> 00:10:00.712
Of course we can do this.

00:10:00.736 --> 00:10:01.998
Let me remind everybody --

00:10:02.022 --> 00:10:03.998
this is not the zombie apocalypse,

00:10:04.022 --> 00:10:06.760
it's not a mass extinction event.

00:10:06.784 --> 00:10:12.820
You know, 98, 99 percent of us
are going to get out of this alive.

00:10:12.844 --> 00:10:16.167
We need to deal with it
the way we know we can,

00:10:16.191 --> 00:10:19.085
and we need to be
the best version of ourselves.

00:10:19.109 --> 00:10:21.180
Both sitting at home

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:24.442
as well as in science,
and certainly in leadership.

00:10:26.236 --> 00:10:29.577
CA: And might there be even
worse pathogens out there

00:10:29.601 --> 00:10:30.752
in the future?

00:10:30.776 --> 00:10:32.388
Like, can you picture or describe

00:10:32.412 --> 00:10:34.955
an even worse combination of those numbers

00:10:34.979 --> 00:10:38.438
that we should start to get ready for?

00:10:39.625 --> 00:10:43.466
LB: Well, smallpox
had an R0 of 3.5 to 4.5,

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.500
so that's probably about what I think
this COVID will be.

00:10:47.524 --> 00:10:50.072
But it killed a third of the people.

00:10:50.096 --> 00:10:51.445
But we had a vaccine.

00:10:51.469 --> 00:10:55.190
So those are the different
sets that you have.

00:10:55.214 --> 00:10:56.907
But what I'm mostly worried about,

00:10:56.931 --> 00:10:58.796
and the reason that we made "Contagion"

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.868
and that was a fictional virus --

00:11:00.892 --> 00:11:03.125
I repeat, for those of you watching,

00:11:03.149 --> 00:11:04.315
that's fiction.

00:11:04.339 --> 00:11:08.172
We created a virus that killed
a lot more than this one did.

00:11:08.196 --> 00:11:10.561
CA: You're talking
about the movie "Contagion"

00:11:10.585 --> 00:11:12.863
that's been trending on Netflix.

00:11:12.887 --> 00:11:14.308
And you were an advisor for.

00:11:14.332 --> 00:11:16.239
LB: Absolutely, that's right.

00:11:16.263 --> 00:11:18.270
But we made that movie deliberately

00:11:18.294 --> 00:11:20.583
to show what a real pandemic looked like,

00:11:20.607 --> 00:11:23.968
but we did choose a pretty awful virus.

00:11:24.536 --> 00:11:26.347
And the reason we showed it like that,

00:11:26.371 --> 00:11:28.599
going from a bat to an apple,

00:11:28.623 --> 00:11:31.490
to a pig, to a cook, to Gwyneth Paltrow,

00:11:31.514 --> 00:11:35.903
was because that is in nature
what we call spillover,

00:11:35.927 --> 00:11:38.299
as zoonotic diseases,

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:41.650
diseases of animals,
spill over to human beings.

00:11:41.674 --> 00:11:43.742
And if I look backwards three decades

00:11:43.766 --> 00:11:45.706
or forward three decades --

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:49.547
looking backward three decades,
Ebola, SARS, Zika,

00:11:49.571 --> 00:11:51.736
swine flu, bird flu, West Nile,

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.161
we can begin almost a catechism

00:11:54.185 --> 00:11:58.116
and listen to all the cacophony
of these names.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:03.752
But there were 30 to 50 novel viruses
that jumped into human beings.

00:12:03.776 --> 00:12:05.729
And I'm afraid, looking forward,

00:12:05.753 --> 00:12:07.784
we are in the age of pandemics,

00:12:07.808 --> 00:12:09.808
we have to behave like that,

00:12:09.832 --> 00:12:12.231
we need to practice One Health,

00:12:12.255 --> 00:12:14.951
we need to understand
that we're living in the same world

00:12:14.975 --> 00:12:17.346
as animals, the environment, and us,

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:22.260
and we get rid of this fiction
that we are some kind of special species.

00:12:22.284 --> 00:12:23.817
To the virus, we're not.

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:25.769
CA: Mmm.

00:12:25.793 --> 00:12:27.522
You mentioned vaccines, though.

00:12:27.546 --> 00:12:30.577
Do you see any accelerated
path to a vaccine?

00:12:31.054 --> 00:12:32.218
LB: I do.

00:12:32.242 --> 00:12:36.121
I'm actually excited to see
that we're doing something

00:12:36.145 --> 00:12:39.497
that we only get to think of
in computer science,

00:12:39.521 --> 00:12:42.260
which is we're changing
what should have always been,

00:12:42.284 --> 00:12:44.017
or has always been, rather,

00:12:44.041 --> 00:12:46.659
multiple sequential processes.

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:51.604
Do safety testing,
then you test for effectiveness,

00:12:51.628 --> 00:12:53.080
then for efficiency.

00:12:53.104 --> 00:12:54.791
And then you manufacture.

00:12:54.815 --> 00:12:57.172
We're doing all three
or four of those steps,

00:12:57.196 --> 00:13:00.199
instead of doing it in sequence,
we're doing in parallel.

00:13:00.223 --> 00:13:04.227
Bill Gates has said he's going to build
seven vaccine production lines

00:13:04.251 --> 00:13:05.409
in the United States,

00:13:05.433 --> 00:13:07.109
and start preparing for production,

00:13:07.133 --> 00:13:10.227
not knowing what the end vaccine
is going to be.

00:13:10.251 --> 00:13:15.576
We're simultaneously doing
safety tests and efficacy tests.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.131
I think the NIH has jumped up.

00:13:18.155 --> 00:13:20.608
I'm very thrilled to see that.

00:13:21.378 --> 00:13:25.084
CA: And how does that translate
into a likely time line, do you think?

00:13:25.108 --> 00:13:27.508
A year, 18 months, is that possible?

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:31.215
LB: You know, Tony Fauci
is our guru in this,

00:13:31.239 --> 00:13:33.227
and he said 12 to 18 months.

00:13:33.251 --> 00:13:37.440
I think that we will do faster
than that in the initial vaccine.

00:13:37.464 --> 00:13:39.694
But you may have heard that this virus

00:13:39.718 --> 00:13:42.988
may not give us the long-term immunity --

00:13:43.012 --> 00:13:44.948
that something like smallpox would do.

00:13:44.972 --> 00:13:48.895
So we're trying to make vaccines
where we add adjuvants

00:13:48.919 --> 00:13:54.355
that actually make the vaccine
create better immunity

00:13:54.379 --> 00:13:55.585
than the disease,

00:13:55.609 --> 00:13:58.680
so that we can confer immunity
for many years.

00:13:58.704 --> 00:14:00.728
That's going to take a little longer.

00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:02.514
CA: Last question, Larry.

00:14:02.538 --> 00:14:07.517
Back in 2006,
as a winner of the TED Prize,

00:14:07.541 --> 00:14:08.692
we granted you a wish,

00:14:08.716 --> 00:14:12.398
and you wished the world would create
this pandemic preparedness system

00:14:12.422 --> 00:14:14.740
that would prevent
something like this happening.

00:14:14.764 --> 00:14:17.112
I feel like we, the world, let you down.

00:14:17.136 --> 00:14:20.087
If you were to make another wish now,

00:14:20.111 --> 00:14:21.261
what would it be?

00:14:22.698 --> 00:14:26.040
LB: Well, I don't think we're let down
in terms of speed of detection.

00:14:26.064 --> 00:14:27.437
I'm actually pretty pleased.

00:14:27.461 --> 00:14:29.706
When we met in 2006,

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:33.371
the average one of these viruses
leaping from an animal to a human,

00:14:33.395 --> 00:14:35.172
it took us six months to find that --

00:14:35.196 --> 00:14:37.141
like the first Ebola, for example.

00:14:37.165 --> 00:14:40.482
We're now finding
the first cases in two weeks.

00:14:40.506 --> 00:14:42.257
I'm not unhappy about that,

00:14:42.281 --> 00:14:45.164
I'd like to push it down
to a single incubation period.

00:14:45.546 --> 00:14:46.863
It's a bigger issue for me.

00:14:46.887 --> 00:14:50.822
What I found is that in
the Smallpox Eradication Programme

00:14:50.846 --> 00:14:54.441
people of all colors,
all religions, all races,

00:14:54.465 --> 00:14:55.783
so many countries,

00:14:55.807 --> 00:14:57.140
came together.

00:14:57.164 --> 00:15:00.490
And it took working as a global community

00:15:00.514 --> 00:15:03.458
to conquer a global pandemic.

00:15:03.482 --> 00:15:09.441
Now, I feel that we have become victims
of centrifugal forces.

00:15:09.465 --> 00:15:13.663
We're in our nationalistic
kind of barricades.

00:15:13.687 --> 00:15:17.346
We will not be able to conquer a pandemic

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:19.752
unless we believe
we're all in it together.

00:15:19.776 --> 00:15:23.903
This is not some Age of Aquarius,
or Kumbaya statement,

00:15:23.927 --> 00:15:27.160
this is what a pandemic
forces us to realize.

00:15:27.184 --> 00:15:28.938
We are all in it together,

00:15:28.962 --> 00:15:32.391
we need a global solution
to a global problem.

00:15:32.415 --> 00:15:35.015
Anything less than that is unthinkable.

00:15:36.153 --> 00:15:38.293
CA: Larry Brilliant,
thank you so very much.

00:15:39.206 --> 00:15:40.606
LB: Thank you, Chris.
