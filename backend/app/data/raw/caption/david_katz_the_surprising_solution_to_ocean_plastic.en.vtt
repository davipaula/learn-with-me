00:00:12.902 --> 00:00:15.333
We've had it all wrong.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.529
Everybody.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.351
We've had it all wrong.

00:00:20.508 --> 00:00:22.594
The very last thing we need to do

00:00:23.515 --> 00:00:24.782
is clean the ocean.

00:00:26.054 --> 00:00:27.229
Very last.

00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:30.985
Yeah, there is a garbage truck of plastic

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.366
entering the ocean

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:35.275
every minute

00:00:35.807 --> 00:00:37.540
of every hour of every day.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.299
And countless birds and animals

00:00:41.323 --> 00:00:43.791
are dying just from encountering plastic.

00:00:46.037 --> 00:00:49.577
We are experiencing
the fastest rate of extinction ever,

00:00:50.132 --> 00:00:52.251
and plastic is in the food chain.

00:00:53.672 --> 00:00:55.811
And I'm still here,
standing in front of you,

00:00:55.835 --> 00:00:57.953
telling you the very last
thing we need to do

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:00.376
is clean the ocean.

00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:02.597
Very last.

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:07.421
If you were to walk into a kitchen,

00:01:08.477 --> 00:01:09.627
sink overflowing,

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:12.873
water spilling all over the floor,

00:01:12.897 --> 00:01:14.431
soaking into the walls,

00:01:14.768 --> 00:01:16.934
you had to think fast,
you're going to panic;

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:20.077
you've got a bucket, a mop or a plunger.

00:01:20.474 --> 00:01:21.874
What do you do first?

00:01:23.531 --> 00:01:25.293
Why don't we turn off the tap?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.872
It would be pointless to mop

00:01:28.896 --> 00:01:30.963
or plunge or scoop up the water

00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:33.714
if we don't turn off the tap first.

00:01:35.693 --> 00:01:37.724
Why aren't we doing the same
for the ocean?

00:01:38.986 --> 00:01:41.186
Even if the Ocean Cleanup project,

00:01:43.846 --> 00:01:45.831
beach plastic recycling programs

00:01:47.768 --> 00:01:49.182
or any well-meaning

00:01:50.164 --> 00:01:52.760
ocean plastic company

00:01:53.442 --> 00:01:55.311
was a hundred percent successful,

00:01:56.538 --> 00:01:58.958
it would still be too little, too late.

00:02:01.315 --> 00:02:04.924
We're trending to produce
over 300 million ton

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.330
of plastic this year.

00:02:09.272 --> 00:02:11.323
Roughly eight million ton

00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:14.895
are racing to flow into the ocean

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:19.372
to join the estimated
150 million ton already there.

00:02:21.765 --> 00:02:24.248
Reportedly, 80 percent of ocean plastic

00:02:26.498 --> 00:02:29.799
is coming from those countries
that have extreme poverty.

00:02:31.466 --> 00:02:33.878
And if you live in the grips of poverty

00:02:34.823 --> 00:02:37.695
concerned, always, about food

00:02:38.704 --> 00:02:39.854
or shelter

00:02:40.846 --> 00:02:42.379
or a sense of security,

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.900
recycling --

00:02:45.393 --> 00:02:47.530
it's beyond your realm of imagination.

00:02:50.123 --> 00:02:52.917
And that is exactly why

00:02:54.155 --> 00:02:56.570
I created the Plastic Bank.

00:02:58.136 --> 00:03:00.482
We are the world's largest chain of stores

00:03:00.506 --> 00:03:01.937
for the ultra-poor,

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.093
where everything in the store
is available to be purchased

00:03:07.117 --> 00:03:09.257
using plastic garbage.

00:03:09.925 --> 00:03:11.092
Everything.

00:03:11.704 --> 00:03:12.854
School tuition.

00:03:13.514 --> 00:03:14.714
Medical insurance.

00:03:15.593 --> 00:03:17.973
Wi-Fi, cell phone minutes, power.

00:03:18.442 --> 00:03:21.172
Sustainable cooking fuel,
high-efficiency stoves.

00:03:23.228 --> 00:03:25.550
And we keep wanting to add everything else

00:03:25.574 --> 00:03:29.295
that the world may need and can't afford.

00:03:32.395 --> 00:03:35.275
Our chain of stores in Haiti
are more like community centers,

00:03:38.173 --> 00:03:39.601
where one of our collectors,

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:41.489
Lise Nasis,

00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:45.663
has the opportunity to earn a living

00:03:46.228 --> 00:03:48.402
by collecting material from door to door,

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.180
from the streets,

00:03:51.204 --> 00:03:52.585
from business to business.

00:03:54.363 --> 00:03:57.675
And at the end of her day,
she gets to bring the material back to us,

00:03:58.236 --> 00:04:00.537
where we weigh it,
we check it for quality,

00:04:00.934 --> 00:04:03.561
and we transfer the value
into her account.

00:04:07.704 --> 00:04:09.704
Lise now has a steady,

00:04:10.386 --> 00:04:12.569
reliable source of income.

00:04:14.784 --> 00:04:18.376
And that value we transfer
into an online account for her.

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:23.173
And because it's a savings account,
it becomes an asset

00:04:23.197 --> 00:04:25.064
that she can borrow against.

00:04:25.768 --> 00:04:27.276
And because it's online,

00:04:29.498 --> 00:04:31.410
she has security against robbery,

00:04:32.656 --> 00:04:34.442
and I think more importantly,

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:36.926
she has a new sense of worth.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.485
And even the plastic

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.734
has a new sense of value.

00:04:45.921 --> 00:04:47.096
Hm.

00:04:48.863 --> 00:04:50.513
And that plastic we collect,

00:04:51.942 --> 00:04:53.276
and we add value to,

00:04:56.684 --> 00:04:58.048
we sort it,

00:04:58.072 --> 00:04:59.222
we remove labels,

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:01.159
we remove caps.

00:05:04.303 --> 00:05:05.503
We either shred it

00:05:06.561 --> 00:05:09.227
or we pack it into bales
and get it ready for export.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.767
Now, it's no different
than walking over acres of diamonds.

00:05:17.093 --> 00:05:19.776
If Lise was to walk over acres of diamonds

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.831
but there was no store, no bank,

00:05:21.855 --> 00:05:24.820
no way to use the diamonds,
no way to exchange them,

00:05:25.855 --> 00:05:27.283
they'd be worthless, too.

00:05:29.934 --> 00:05:32.133
And Lise was widowed

00:05:32.157 --> 00:05:34.164
after the 2010 Haitian earthquake,

00:05:35.768 --> 00:05:37.315
left homeless without an income.

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:39.339
And as a result of the program,

00:05:40.268 --> 00:05:42.680
Lise can afford her two
daughters' school tuition

00:05:43.736 --> 00:05:44.886
and uniforms.

00:05:46.911 --> 00:05:48.061
Now, that plastic

00:05:49.213 --> 00:05:50.363
we sell.

00:05:53.276 --> 00:05:56.196
We sell it to suppliers of great brands

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.958
like Marks and Spencer,

00:05:57.982 --> 00:06:00.601
who have commissioned
the use of social plastic

00:06:01.815 --> 00:06:03.015
in their products.

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:06.148
Or like Henkel,

00:06:06.172 --> 00:06:08.020
the German consumer-goods company,

00:06:09.767 --> 00:06:13.353
who are using social plastic
directly into their manufacturing.

00:06:13.377 --> 00:06:14.988
We've closed the loop

00:06:16.196 --> 00:06:17.600
in the circular economy.

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:22.124
Now buy shampoo

00:06:23.101 --> 00:06:24.434
or laundry detergent

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.150
that has social plastic packaging,

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.315
and you are indirectly contributing

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:33.565
to the extraction of plastic
from ocean-bound waterways

00:06:34.187 --> 00:06:35.653
and alleviating poverty

00:06:36.091 --> 00:06:37.241
at the same time.

00:06:39.488 --> 00:06:40.638
And that model

00:06:41.083 --> 00:06:42.950
is completely replicable.

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:45.529
In SÃ£o Paulo,

00:06:46.538 --> 00:06:48.410
a church sermon encourages parishioners

00:06:48.434 --> 00:06:50.656
to not just bring offering on Sunday,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.102
but the recycling, too.

00:06:53.561 --> 00:06:55.616
We then match the church with the poor.

00:06:56.577 --> 00:06:58.029
Or, I believe more powerfully,

00:06:58.053 --> 00:07:01.541
we could match a mosque in London
with an impoverished church in Cairo.

00:07:02.792 --> 00:07:04.192
Or like in Vancouver,

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:06.823
with our bottle-deposit program:

00:07:07.395 --> 00:07:08.595
now any individual

00:07:09.482 --> 00:07:10.632
or any group

00:07:11.371 --> 00:07:12.534
can now return

00:07:12.558 --> 00:07:14.933
their deposit-refundable recyclables,

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.355
and instead of taking back the cash,

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.410
they have the opportunity
to deposit that value

00:07:20.434 --> 00:07:23.355
into the account of the poor
around the world.

00:07:24.776 --> 00:07:26.642
We can now use our recycling

00:07:27.093 --> 00:07:29.355
to support and create recyclers.

00:07:30.688 --> 00:07:32.711
One bottle deposited at home

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.228
could help extract
hundreds around the world.

00:07:37.193 --> 00:07:39.089
Or, like Shell,

00:07:39.518 --> 00:07:40.785
the energy company,

00:07:41.581 --> 00:07:44.549
who's invested in our
plastic-neutral program.

00:07:44.927 --> 00:07:47.727
Plastic neutrality is like carbon-neutral.

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:52.584
But plastic neutrality invests
in recycling infrastructure

00:07:52.608 --> 00:07:53.892
where it doesn't exist.

00:07:55.379 --> 00:07:57.548
And it provides an incentive for the poor

00:07:57.886 --> 00:07:59.371
by providing a price increase.

00:08:00.786 --> 00:08:01.936
Or --

00:08:02.349 --> 00:08:03.984
like in the slums of Manila,

00:08:04.888 --> 00:08:07.456
where the smallest market

00:08:08.929 --> 00:08:11.193
with a simple scale and a phone

00:08:11.569 --> 00:08:13.502
can now accept social plastic

00:08:13.886 --> 00:08:16.219
as a new form of payment by weight,

00:08:16.831 --> 00:08:19.053
allowing them to serve more people

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.417
and have their own greater social impact.

00:08:25.267 --> 00:08:26.734
And what's common here

00:08:29.387 --> 00:08:31.022
is that social plastic

00:08:31.688 --> 00:08:32.838
is money.

00:08:33.704 --> 00:08:35.676
Social plastic is money,

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:40.855
a globally recognizable and tradable
currency that, when used,

00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:43.580
alleviates poverty
and cleans the environment

00:08:43.604 --> 00:08:45.365
at the same time.

00:08:47.825 --> 00:08:49.292
It's not just plastic.

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:52.524
It's not recycled plastic,
it's social plastic,

00:08:53.943 --> 00:08:56.116
a material whose value is transferred

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.824
through the lives
of the people who encounter it,

00:08:59.259 --> 00:09:01.398
rich and poor.

00:09:04.347 --> 00:09:05.680
Humans have produced

00:09:05.704 --> 00:09:08.848
over eight trillion kilograms of plastic,

00:09:08.872 --> 00:09:11.304
most of it still here as waste.

00:09:12.006 --> 00:09:13.776
Eight trillion kilograms.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.882
Worth roughly 50 cents a kilo,

00:09:17.323 --> 00:09:21.930
we're potentially unleashing
a four-trillion-dollar value.

00:09:23.966 --> 00:09:25.699
See, I see social plastic

00:09:26.466 --> 00:09:28.247
as the Bitcoin for the earth --

00:09:28.828 --> 00:09:29.870
(Laughter)

00:09:29.894 --> 00:09:31.880
and available for everyone.

00:09:37.908 --> 00:09:40.783
Now the entire ecosystem
is managed and supported

00:09:40.807 --> 00:09:42.978
through an online banking platform

00:09:44.472 --> 00:09:48.267
that provides for the safe,
authentic transfer of value globally.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:52.612
You can now deposit your recyclables
in Vancouver or Berlin,

00:09:53.065 --> 00:09:56.725
and a family could withdraw
building bricks or cell phone minutes

00:09:57.152 --> 00:09:58.420
in the slums of Manila.

00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:00.548
Or Lise --

00:10:02.358 --> 00:10:05.136
she could deposit recycling
at a center in Port-au-Prince,

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.723
and her mother could withdraw
cooking fuel or cash

00:10:07.747 --> 00:10:08.897
across the city.

00:10:11.149 --> 00:10:13.392
And the app adds rewards,

00:10:13.776 --> 00:10:14.926
incentives,

00:10:15.553 --> 00:10:16.789
group prizes,

00:10:17.696 --> 00:10:18.846
user rating.

00:10:20.708 --> 00:10:22.366
We've gamified recycling.

00:10:23.374 --> 00:10:25.690
We add fun and formality

00:10:26.566 --> 00:10:28.125
into an informal industry.

00:10:31.271 --> 00:10:33.464
We're operating in Haiti
and the Philippines.

00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:36.149
We've selected staff

00:10:36.858 --> 00:10:38.842
and partners for Brazil.

00:10:39.301 --> 00:10:42.191
And this year, we're committing
to India and Ethiopia.

00:10:44.198 --> 00:10:45.865
We're collecting hundreds

00:10:46.738 --> 00:10:48.666
and hundreds of tons of material.

00:10:49.261 --> 00:10:51.061
We continue to add partners

00:10:51.944 --> 00:10:53.094
and customers,

00:10:55.332 --> 00:10:58.195
and we increase our collection
volumes every day.

00:10:59.007 --> 00:11:01.292
Now as a result
of our program with Henkel,

00:11:02.047 --> 00:11:06.332
they've committed to use
over 100 million kilograms

00:11:06.356 --> 00:11:08.915
of material every year.

00:11:10.617 --> 00:11:13.268
That alone will put
hundreds of millions of dollars

00:11:13.292 --> 00:11:15.025
into the hands of the poor

00:11:15.434 --> 00:11:16.950
in the emerging economies.

00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:21.909
And so now,

00:11:22.751 --> 00:11:23.901
we can all

00:11:25.236 --> 00:11:26.903
be a part of the solution

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.040
and not the pollution.

00:11:31.145 --> 00:11:34.783
And so, OK, maybe
cleaning the ocean is futile.

00:11:35.407 --> 00:11:36.557
It might be.

00:11:37.812 --> 00:11:39.766
But preventing ocean plastic

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.160
could be humanity's richest opportunity.

00:11:45.084 --> 00:11:46.358
Thank you.

00:11:46.382 --> 00:11:51.920
