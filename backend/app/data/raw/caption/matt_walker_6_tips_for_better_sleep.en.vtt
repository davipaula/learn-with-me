00:00:00.158 --> 00:00:02.620
We can all have a bad night of sleep

00:00:02.644 --> 00:00:05.036
and that's perfectly normal,

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.001
but how could we try to improve

00:00:07.025 --> 00:00:10.533
both the quantity
and the quality of our sleep?

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.172
[Sleeping with Science]

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:15.473
(Music)

00:00:15.497 --> 00:00:19.411
Here are six scientifically grounded tips

00:00:19.435 --> 00:00:20.600
for better sleep.

00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:23.250
The first tip is regularity.

00:00:23.274 --> 00:00:26.646
Go to bed at the same time
and wake up at the same time.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.765
Regularity is king,

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.272
and it will actually anchor your sleep

00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:34.287
and improve both
the quantity and the quality,

00:00:34.311 --> 00:00:37.439
no matter whether
it's the weekday or the weekend

00:00:37.463 --> 00:00:39.582
or even if you've had
a bad night of sleep.

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:42.647
And the reason is
because deep within your brain,

00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:46.186
you actually have a master 24-hour clock.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.821
It expects regularity

00:00:48.845 --> 00:00:52.946
and works best under
conditions of regularity,

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.712
including the control
of your sleep-wake schedule.

00:00:56.736 --> 00:00:59.110
Many of us use an alarm to wake up

00:00:59.134 --> 00:01:02.173
but very few of us use a to-bed alarm,

00:01:02.197 --> 00:01:04.172
and that's something that can be helpful.

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:06.939
The next tip is temperature.

00:01:06.963 --> 00:01:08.114
Keep it cool.

00:01:08.138 --> 00:01:10.651
It turns out that your brain and your body

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:15.646
need to drop their core temperature
by about one degree Celsius

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.396
or around two to three degrees Fahrenheit

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.427
in order to initiate sleep
and then to stay asleep.

00:01:22.451 --> 00:01:25.702
And this is the reason
that you will always find it easier

00:01:25.726 --> 00:01:29.683
to fall asleep in a room
that's too cold than too hot.

00:01:29.707 --> 00:01:31.448
So, the current recommendation

00:01:31.472 --> 00:01:34.048
is to aim for a bedroom temperature

00:01:34.072 --> 00:01:37.292
of around about 65 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:01:37.316 --> 00:01:40.148
or a little over 18 degrees Celsius.

00:01:40.172 --> 00:01:43.243
It sounds cold but cold it must be.

00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:45.761
The next tip is darkness.

00:01:46.135 --> 00:01:48.980
We are a dark-deprived society

00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:52.904
and, in fact, we need darkness
specifically in the evening

00:01:52.928 --> 00:01:56.992
to trigger the release
of a hormone called melatonin.

00:01:57.016 --> 00:02:02.408
And melatonin helps regulate
the healthy timing of our sleep.

00:02:02.432 --> 00:02:04.399
In the last hour before bed,

00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:08.079
try to stay away from all
of those computer screens

00:02:08.103 --> 00:02:10.168
and tablets and phones.

00:02:10.192 --> 00:02:13.441
Dim down half the lights in your house.

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:15.455
You'd actually be quite surprised

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:18.287
at how sleepy that can make you feel.

00:02:18.311 --> 00:02:20.828
If you'd like, you can wear an eye mask

00:02:20.852 --> 00:02:23.002
or you can have blackout shades

00:02:23.026 --> 00:02:25.360
and that will help best regulate

00:02:25.384 --> 00:02:28.341
that critical sleep hormone of melatonin.

00:02:28.365 --> 00:02:30.944
The next tip is walk it out.

00:02:30.968 --> 00:02:34.958
Don't stay in bed awake
for long periods of time.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.008
And the general rule of thumb

00:02:37.032 --> 00:02:39.063
is if you've been trying to fall asleep

00:02:39.087 --> 00:02:41.548
and it's been 25 minutes or so,

00:02:41.572 --> 00:02:44.468
or you've woken up
and you can't get back to sleep

00:02:44.492 --> 00:02:46.013
after 25 minutes,

00:02:46.037 --> 00:02:48.881
the recommendation is to get out of bed

00:02:48.905 --> 00:02:50.883
and go and do something different.

00:02:50.907 --> 00:02:53.193
And the reason is because your brain

00:02:53.217 --> 00:02:56.042
is an incredibly associative device.

00:02:56.066 --> 00:02:58.764
The brain has learned the association

00:02:58.788 --> 00:03:02.020
that the bed is this trigger
of wakefulness,

00:03:02.044 --> 00:03:04.647
and we need to break that association.

00:03:04.671 --> 00:03:08.107
And by getting out of bed,
you can go and do something else.

00:03:08.131 --> 00:03:11.274
Only return to bed when you're sleepy.

00:03:11.298 --> 00:03:12.949
And in that way, gradually,

00:03:12.973 --> 00:03:16.234
your brain will relearn the association

00:03:16.258 --> 00:03:21.145
that your bed is this place
of sound and consistent sleep.

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.824
The fifth tip is something
that we've actually

00:03:23.848 --> 00:03:27.244
already spoken about
in detail in this series,

00:03:27.268 --> 00:03:30.469
which is the impact
of alcohol and caffeine.

00:03:30.493 --> 00:03:33.336
So, a good rule of thumb here
is to try to stay away

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.357
from caffeine in the afternoon
and in the evening

00:03:36.381 --> 00:03:39.896
and certainly try
not to go to bed too tipsy.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.067
The final tip: have a wind-down routine.

00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:46.924
I think many of us in the modern world,

00:03:46.948 --> 00:03:49.972
we expect to be able
to dive into bed at night,

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:51.456
switch off the light,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.366
and we think that sleep
is also just like a light switch,

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.921
that we should immediately
be able to fall asleep.

00:03:57.945 --> 00:04:00.993
Well, unfortunately,
sleep isn't quite like that

00:04:01.017 --> 00:04:02.256
for most of us.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.471
Sleep, as a physiological process,

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.964
is much more similar to landing a plane.

00:04:08.988 --> 00:04:13.614
It takes time for your brain
to gradually descend down

00:04:13.638 --> 00:04:17.278
onto the firm bedrock of good sleep.

00:04:17.302 --> 00:04:20.738
In the last 20 minutes before bed
or the last half an hour,

00:04:20.762 --> 00:04:22.083
even the last hour,

00:04:22.107 --> 00:04:25.032
disengage from your computer
and your phone

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:27.327
and try to do something relaxing.

00:04:27.351 --> 00:04:29.689
Find out whatever works for you

00:04:29.713 --> 00:04:33.632
and when you have found it,
stick to that routine.

00:04:33.656 --> 00:04:35.348
The last thing I should note

00:04:35.372 --> 00:04:39.241
is that if you are suffering
from a sleep disorder,

00:04:39.265 --> 00:04:43.176
for example, from insomnia or sleep apnea,

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.954
then these tips aren't necessarily
going to help you.

00:04:46.978 --> 00:04:48.644
If I was your sports coach,

00:04:48.668 --> 00:04:52.359
I could give you all of these tips
to improve your performance,

00:04:52.383 --> 00:04:54.326
but if you have a broken ankle,

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.176
it's not going to make a difference.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.786
We have to treat the broken ankle first

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.100
before we can get back to improving
the quality of your performance.

00:05:03.124 --> 00:05:05.065
And it's the same way with sleep.

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:07.806
So, if you think
you have a sleep disorder,

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.519
just go and speak with your doctor.

00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:11.370
That's the best piece of advice.

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:13.150
Where do we stand, then,

00:05:13.174 --> 00:05:16.089
in all of this conversation about sleep?

00:05:16.412 --> 00:05:19.308
Well, I think the evidence is clear.

00:05:19.332 --> 00:05:24.007
We can think of sleep
almost like a life-support system.

00:05:24.031 --> 00:05:28.519
In fact, some may even
call sleep a super power.
