00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.572
Whether you're cramming for an exam

00:00:02.596 --> 00:00:05.777
or trying to learn
a new musical instrument

00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:08.436
or even trying to perfect a new sport,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.166
sleep may actually be
your secret memory weapon.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.999
[Sleeping with Science]

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.327
Studies have actually told us
that sleep is critical for memory

00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:23.171
in at least three different ways.

00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:26.566
First, we know that you need
sleep before learning

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.686
to actually get your brain ready,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.113
almost like a dry sponge,

00:00:31.137 --> 00:00:33.796
ready to initially soak up
new information.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.526
And without sleep, the memory
circuits within the brain

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.506
effectively become
waterlogged, as it were,

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.276
and we can't absorb new information.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.326
We can't effectively lay down
those new memory traces.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.146
But it's not only important
that you sleep before learning,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.766
because we also know
that you need sleep after learning

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.106
to essentially hit the save button
on those new memories

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.686
so that we don't forget.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.336
In fact, sleep will actually
future-proof that information

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.716
within the brain,

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.741
cementing those memories

00:01:07.765 --> 00:01:11.236
into the architecture
of those neural networks.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.090
And we've begun to discover

00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:19.716
exactly how sleep achieves
this memory-consolidation benefit.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.966
The first mechanism
is a file-transfer process.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.816
And here, we can speak about
two different structures

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.996
within the brain.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.876
The first is called the hippocampus

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.676
and the hippocampus
sits on the left and the right side

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.976
of your brain.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.936
And you can think of the hippocampus

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.586
almost like the informational
inbox of your brain.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.376
It's very good at receiving
new memory files

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.776
and holding onto them.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.266
The second structure
that we can speak about

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.786
is called the cortex.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.666
This wrinkled massive tissue
that sits on top of your brain.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.776
And during deep sleep,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.656
there is this file-transfer mechanism.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.686
Think of the hippocampus like a USB stick

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.496
and your cortex like the hard drive.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.466
And during the day, we're going around

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.416
and we're gathering lots of files,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.956
but then during deep sleep at night,

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.586
because of that limited storage capacity,

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.106
we have to transfer those files
from the hippocampus

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.156
over to the hard drive
of the brain, the cortex.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.436
And that's exactly one of the mechanisms

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.516
that deep sleep seems to provide.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.196
But there's another mechanism
that we've become aware of

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.686
that helps cement
those memories into the brain.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.026
And it's called replay.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.216
Several years ago,

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.225
scientists were looking
at how rats learned

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:41.316
as they would run around a maze.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.796
And they were recording the activity
in the memory centers of these rats.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.146
And as the rat was running
around the maze,

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.726
different brain cells would code
different parts of the maze.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.422
And so if you added a tone
to each one of the brain cells

00:02:56.446 --> 00:03:00.086
what you would hear
as the rat was starting to learn the maze

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.106
was the signature of that memory.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.173
So it would sound a little bit like ...

00:03:04.197 --> 00:03:07.696
(Bouncy piano music)

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.876
It was this signature of learning
that we could hear.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.626
But then they did something clever.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.236
They kept listening to the brain
as these rats fell asleep,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.668
and what they heard was remarkable.

00:03:21.692 --> 00:03:23.816
The rat, as it was sleeping,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.676
started to replay
that same memory signature.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.066
But now it started to replay it
almost 10 times faster

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.236
than it was doing when it was awake.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.613
So now instead you would start to hear ...

00:03:37.637 --> 00:03:40.636
(Fast bouncy piano music)

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.656
That seems to be the second way

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.896
in which sleep can actually
strengthen these memories.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.376
Sleep is actually replaying
and scoring those memories

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.726
into a new circuit within the brain,

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.586
strengthening that memory representation.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.936
The final way in which sleep
is beneficial for memory

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.746
is integration and association.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.586
In fact, we're now learning that sleep

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.696
is much more intelligent
than we ever imagined.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.906
Sleep doesn't just simply
strengthen individual memories,

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.776
sleep will actually cleverly interconnect
new memories together.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.007
And as a consequence,

00:04:17.031 --> 00:04:19.006
you can wake up the next day

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.216
with a revised mind-wide
web of associations,

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.546
we can come up with solutions
to previously impenetrable problems.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.131
And this is probably the reason

00:04:31.155 --> 00:04:35.726
that you've never been told
to stay awake on a problem.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.616
Instead, you're told
to sleep on a problem,

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.103
and that's exactly
what the science teaching us.
