00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.542
Stephanie White: I'm going to let her 
introduce herself to everybody.

00:00:15.542 --> 00:00:16.620
Can you tell everybody your name?

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.710
Einstein: Einstein.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.460
SW: This is Einstein. 
Can you tell everyone "hi"?

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.732
E: Hello.

00:00:21.732 --> 00:00:23.839
SW: That's nice. Can you be polite?

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:24.630
E: Hi, sweetheart.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.910
SW: Much better.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.270
Well, Einstein is very honored 
to be here at TED 2006,

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.160
amongst all you modern-day Einsteins.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.620
In fact, she's very excited.

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.400
E: Woo.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.160
SW: Yeah.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.160
(Laughter)

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.160
Since we've arrived, 
there's been a constant buzz

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.930
about all the exciting speakers here 
for the conference.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.800
This morning we've heard a lot of whispers
about Tom O'Reilly's wrap-up on Saturday.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.160
Einstein, did you hear whispers?

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.160
E: [Squawks]

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.160
SW: Yeah.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.160
(Laughter)

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.060
Einstein's especially interested 
in Penelope's talk.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.131
A lot of her research goes on in case, 
which can get pretty dusty.

00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:56.160
E: Achoo!

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.720
SW: It could make her sneeze.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.110
But more importantly, 
her research could help Einstein

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.831
find a cure for her 
never-ending scratchy throat.

00:01:02.831 --> 00:01:03.950
Einstein: [Coughs]

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.160
SW: Yeah.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.930
(Laughter)

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.860
Well, Bob Russell was telling us 
about his work on nanotubes

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.150
in his research at the microscopic level.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.160
Well, that's really cool, 
but what Einstein's really hoping

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.590
is that maybe he'll genetically engineer 
a five-pound peanut.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.160
E: Oh, my God! My God! My God!

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.545
SW: Yeah. She would get 
really, really excited.

00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:22.710
(Laughter)

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.240
That is one big peanut.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.930
Since Einstein is a bird,

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.370
she's very interested in things that fly.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.160
She thinks Burt Rutan is very impressive.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.760
E: Ooh.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.996
SW: Yeah. She especially likes 
his latest achievement, SpaceShipOne.

00:01:35.996 --> 00:01:38.510
Einstein, would you like to ride 
in Burt's spaceship?

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.380
E: [Spaceship noise]

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.060
SW: Even if it doesn't have a laser?

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.160
E: [Laser noise]

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.160
(Laughter)

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:48.819
SW: Yeah, yeah. 
That was pretty funny, Einstein.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.710
Now, Einstein also thinks, you know,

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.890
working in caves 
and travelling through space --

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.708
it's all very dangerous jobs.

00:01:56.708 --> 00:01:59.160
It would be very dangerous 
if you fell down.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.850
E: Wheeeeeee! [Splat]

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.800
SW: Yeah.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.160
(Laughter)

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.130
Little splat at the end there. 
Einstein, did that hurt?

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.940
E: Ow, ow, ow.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.050
SW: Yeah. It's all a lot of hard work.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.010
E: [Squawks]

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.421
SW: Yeah. It can get a bird 
like Einstein frustrated.

00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:13.160
E: [Squawks]

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.620
SW: Yeah, it sure can.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.667
But when Einstein needs to relax 
from her job educating the public

00:02:17.667 --> 00:02:19.160
she loves to take in the arts.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.800
If the children of the Uganda 
need another dance partner,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.010
Einstein could sure fit the bill, 
because she loves to dance.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.160
Can you get down?

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.160
E: [Bobbing head] (Laughter)

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.630
SW: Let's get down for everybody. 
Come on now.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.160
She's going to make me 
do it, too. Ooh, ooh.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.160
Einstein: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.160
SW: Do your head now.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.033
E: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
(Laughter)

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.020
SW: Or maybe Sirena Huang would like 
to learn some arias on her violin,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.160
and Einstein can sing along 
with some opera?

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.160
E: [Operatic squawk]

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.160
SW: Very good.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.160
(Laughter)

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.160
Or maybe Stu just needs 
another backup singer?

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.160
Einstein, can you also sing?

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160
I know, you need to get rid 
of that seed first. Can you sing?

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.160
E: La, la.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
SW: There you go.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.820
And, of course, if all else fails,

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.160
she can just run off 
and enjoy a fun fiesta.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.160
E: [Squawks]

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.650
SW: All right.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.210
Well, Einstein was pretty embarrassed 
to admit this earlier,

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.070
but she was telling me backstage 
that she had a problem.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.020
E: What's the matter?

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.571
SW: No, I don't have a problem. 
You have the problem, remember?

00:03:17.571 --> 00:03:19.677
You were saying 
that you were really embarrassed,

00:03:19.677 --> 00:03:21.680
because you're in love with a pirate?

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.670
E: Yar.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.830
SW: There we go. And what do
pirates like to drink?

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.720
E: Beer.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.798
SW: Yeah, that's right.

00:03:27.798 --> 00:03:29.650
But you don't like to drink beer, 
Einstein.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.860
You like to drink water.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.960
E: [Water sound]

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.750
SW: Very good. Now, really,
she is pretty nervous.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.740
Because one of her favorite folks 
from back home is here,

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.480
and she's pretty nervous to meet him.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.130
She thinks Al Gore 
is a really good-looking man.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.510
What do you say to a good-looking man?

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.510
E: Hey, baby.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.160
(Laughter)

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.794
SW: And so do all the folks 
back home in Tennessee.

00:03:49.794 --> 00:03:51.160
E: Yee haw.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.160
(Laughter)

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.160
SW: And since she's such a big fan,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.660
she knows that his birthday 
is coming up at the end of March.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.470
And we didn't think he'd be in town then,

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.160
so Einstein wanted to do 
something special for him.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.160
So let's see if Einstein will sing 
"Happy Birthday" to Al Gore.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.160
Can you sing "Happy Birthday" to him?

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.766
E: Happy birthday to you.

00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:10.060
SW: Again.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.790
E: Happy birthday to you.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.730
SW: Again.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.160
E: Happy birthday to you.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.160
SW: Big finish.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.160
E: Happy birthday to you.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.160
SW: Good job!

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.160
(Applause)

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.610
Well, before we wrap it up, 
she would like to give a shout out

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.160
to all our animal friends 
back at the Knoxville Zoo.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.581
Einstein, do you want 
to say "hi" to all the owls?

00:04:34.581 --> 00:04:35.570
E: Woo, woo, woo.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.160
SW: What about the other birds?

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.160
E: Tweet, tweet, tweet.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.160
SW: And the penguin?

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.980
E: Quack, quack, quack.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.160
SW: There we go.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.160
(Laughter)

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.440
Let's get that one out of there. 
How about a chimpanzee?

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.160
E: Ooh, ooh, ooh. Aah, aah, aah.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.160
SW: Very good.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.160
(Laughter)

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.160
What about a wolf?

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.890
E: Ooooowww.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:50.810
SW: And a pig?

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.160
E: Oink, oink, oink.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.160
SW: And the rooster?

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.710
E: Cock-a-doodle-doo!

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.530
SW: And how about those cats?

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.320
E: Meow.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.160
(Laughter)

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.655
SW: At the zoo we have 
big cats from the jungle.

00:05:00.655 --> 00:05:01.593
E: Grrrrr.

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:03.070
(Laughter)

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:04.660
SW: What about a skunk?

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:05.660
E: Stinker.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.710
(Laughter)

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.260
SW: She's a comedian. I suppose 
you think you're famous? Are you famous?

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.160
E: Superstar.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.360
SW: Yeah. You are a superstar.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.160
(Laughter)

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.720
Well, we would like 
to encourage all of you

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.840
to do your part to help protect 
Einstein's animal friends,

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.020
and to do your part to help protect 
their homes that they live [in].

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.860
Now, Einstein does say it best 
when we ask her.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.430
Why do we want to protect your home?

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.160
E: I'm special.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.160
SW: You are very special.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.880
What would you like to say
to all these nice people?

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.240
E: I love you.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.640
SW: That's good. 
Can you blow them a kiss?

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.160
E: [Kissing noise]

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.640
SW: And what do you say 
when it's time to go?

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.910
E: Goodbye.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.400
SW: Good job. Thank you all.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.160
(Applause)
