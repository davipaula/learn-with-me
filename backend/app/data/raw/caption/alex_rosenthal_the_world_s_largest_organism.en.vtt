00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.430
This is Goliath, the krill.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.270
Don’t get too attached.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.330
Today this 1 centimeter crustacean

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.017
will share the same fate as 40 million
of his closest friends:

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:22.696
a life sentence in the belly 
of the largest blue whale in the world.

00:00:22.696 --> 00:00:25.636
Let’s call her Leviatha.

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:29.968
Leviatha weighs 
something like 150 metric tons,

00:00:29.968 --> 00:00:33.406
and she’s the largest animal in the world.

00:00:33.406 --> 00:00:38.289
But she’s not even close to being 
the largest organism by weight,

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.969
which is estimated to equal 
about 40 Leviatha’s.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.629
So where is this behemoth?

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.734
Here, in Utah.

00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:48.574
Sorry, that’s too close.

00:00:48.574 --> 00:00:49.484
Here.

00:00:49.484 --> 00:00:54.371
This is Pando, whose name means
“I spread out.”

00:00:54.371 --> 00:01:01.590
Pando, a quaking aspen, has roughly
47,000 genetically identical clone trunks.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.150
Those all grow from one 
enormous root system,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.365
which is why scientists consider Pando
a single organism.

00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:14.065
Pando is the clear winner 
of world’s largest organism by weight—

00:01:14.065 --> 00:01:18.709
an incredible 6 million kilograms.

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:22.199
So how did Pando get to be so huge?

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:26.361
Pando is not an unusual aspen 
from a genetic standpoint.

00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:30.852
Rather, Pando’s size boils down 
to three main factors:

00:01:30.852 --> 00:01:36.781
its age, its location, and aspens’ 
remarkable evolutionary adaptation

00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:38.821
of self-cloning.

00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:43.769
So first, Pando is incredibly expansive
because it’s incredibly old.

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:45.589
How old exactly?

00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:47.509
No one knows.

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:54.081
Dendrochronologist estimates range
from 80,000 to 1 million years.

00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:58.081
The problem is, there’s no simple way
to gauge Pando’s age.

00:01:58.081 --> 00:02:03.370
Counting the rings of a single trunk will
only account for up to 200 years or so,

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.008
as Pando is in a constant cycle of growth,
death, and renewal.

00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:13.286
On average, each individual tree 
lives 130 years,

00:02:13.286 --> 00:02:17.471
before falling and being
replaced by new ones.

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:19.441
Second: location.

00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:23.774
During the last ice age, 
which ended about 12,000 years ago,

00:02:23.774 --> 00:02:26.699
glaciers covered much 
of the North American climate

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:28.319
friendly to aspens.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.444
So if there were other comparably 
sized clonal colonies,

00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:35.094
they may have perished then.

00:02:35.094 --> 00:02:39.476
Meanwhile, Pando’s corner of Utah
remained glacier-free.

00:02:39.476 --> 00:02:44.450
The soil there is rich in nutrients 
that Pando continuously replenishes;

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.330
as it drops leaves and trunks,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.940
the nutrients return to nourish
new generations of clones.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.886
Which brings us to the third cause
of Pando’s size: cloning.

00:02:55.886 --> 00:02:59.206
Aspens are capable 
of both sexual reproduction—

00:02:59.206 --> 00:03:01.636
which produces a new organism—

00:03:01.636 --> 00:03:05.964
and asexual reproduction— 
which creates a clone.

00:03:05.964 --> 00:03:10.374
They tend to reproduce sexually 
when conditions are unfavorable

00:03:10.374 --> 00:03:14.563
and the best strategy for survival 
is to move elsewhere.

00:03:14.563 --> 00:03:18.700
Trees aren’t particularly mobile,
but their seeds are.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.017
Like the rest of us, sexual reproduction
is how Pando came into the world

00:03:23.017 --> 00:03:28.238
in the first place all those tens 
or hundreds of thousands of years ago.

00:03:28.238 --> 00:03:32.646
The wind or a pollinator carried pollen
from the flower of one of its parents

00:03:32.646 --> 00:03:36.646
to the other, where a sperm
cell fertilized an egg.

00:03:36.646 --> 00:03:39.446
That flower produced fruit, 
which split open,

00:03:39.446 --> 00:03:42.556
releasing hundreds of tiny, light seeds.

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:46.796
The wind carried one to a wet spot
of land in what is now Utah,

00:03:46.796 --> 00:03:51.929
where it took root and germinated
into Pando’s first stem.

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:56.823
A couple of years later, Pando grew mature
enough to reproduce asexually.

00:03:56.823 --> 00:03:59.743
Asexual reproduction, or cloning,

00:03:59.743 --> 00:04:03.957
tends to happen when the environment 
is favorable to growth.

00:04:03.957 --> 00:04:08.074
Aspens have long roots that burrow 
through the soil.

00:04:08.074 --> 00:04:12.074
These can sprout shoots that grow up
into new trunks.

00:04:12.074 --> 00:04:16.514
And while Pando grew and spread out,
so did our ancestors.

00:04:16.514 --> 00:04:20.929
As Hunter-gatherers who made 
cave paintings, survived an ice age,

00:04:20.929 --> 00:04:26.156
found their way to North America, built
civilizations in Egypt and Mesopotamia,

00:04:26.156 --> 00:04:30.507
fought wars, domesticated animals,
fought wars, formed nations,

00:04:30.507 --> 00:04:31.647
built machines,

00:04:31.647 --> 00:04:37.076
and invented the internet, 
and always newer ways to fight wars.

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:42.708
Pando has survived many millennia 
of changing climates and encroaching ice.

00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:45.918
But it may not survive us.

00:04:45.918 --> 00:04:50.185
New stems are growing to maturity 
much more slowly than they need to

00:04:50.185 --> 00:04:53.225
in order to replace the trunks that fall.

00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:56.895
Scientists have identified two main
reasons for this.

00:04:56.895 --> 00:05:00.895
The first is that we’ve deprived 
Pando of fire.

00:05:00.895 --> 00:05:05.235
When a fire clears a patch of forest,
Aspen roots survive,

00:05:05.235 --> 00:05:10.044
and send shoots bursting up out 
of the ground by the tens of thousands.

00:05:10.044 --> 00:05:14.281
And secondly, grazers like herds of cattle
and mule deer—

00:05:14.281 --> 00:05:18.281
whose natural predators we’ve hunted
to the point of local elimination—

00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:21.471
are eating Pando’s fresh growth.

00:05:21.471 --> 00:05:27.651
If we lose the world’s largest organism,
we’ll lose a scientific treasure trove.

00:05:27.651 --> 00:05:30.701
Because Pando’s trunks 
are genetically identical,

00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:33.481
they can serve as a controlled setting
for studies

00:05:33.481 --> 00:05:36.081
on everything from the tree microbiome

00:05:36.081 --> 00:05:39.791
to the influence of climate
on tree growth rates.

00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:43.791
The good news is, 
we have a chance to save Pando,

00:05:43.791 --> 00:05:46.631
by reducing livestock grazing in the area

00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:50.461
and further protecting 
the vulnerable young saplings.

00:05:50.461 --> 00:05:53.201
And the time to act is today.

00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:57.652
Because as with so many other marvels
of our natural world,

00:05:57.652 --> 00:06:03.892
once they’re gone it will be a very,
very long time before they return.
