00:00:06.793 --> 00:00:11.073
During World War I, one of the 
horrors of trench warfare

00:00:11.073 --> 00:00:15.200
was a poisonous yellow cloud 
called mustard gas.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.090
For those unlucky enough to be exposed,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.982
it made the air impossible to breathe, 
burned their eyes,

00:00:21.982 --> 00:00:26.034
and caused huge blisters on exposed skin.

00:00:26.034 --> 00:00:31.536
Scientists tried desperately to develop an
antidote to this vicious weapon of war.

00:00:31.536 --> 00:00:37.201
In the process they discovered the gas 
was irrevocably damaging the bone marrow

00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:41.651
of affected soldiers— halting its 
ability to make blood cells.

00:00:41.651 --> 00:00:46.727
Despite these awful effects, 
it gave scientists an idea.

00:00:46.727 --> 00:00:52.803
Cancer cells share a characteristic with 
bone marrow: both replicate rapidly.

00:00:52.803 --> 00:00:55.333
So could one of the atrocities of war

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:58.262
become a champion in the 
fight against cancer?

00:00:58.262 --> 00:01:01.541
Researchers in the 1930s 
investigated this idea

00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:05.052
by injecting compounds derived 
from mustard gas

00:01:05.052 --> 00:01:07.664
into the veins of cancer patients.

00:01:07.664 --> 00:01:12.909
It took time and trial and error to find 
treatments that did more good than harm,

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.999
but by the end of World War II,

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:20.135
they discovered what became known 
as the first chemotherapy drugs.

00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:22.545
Today, there are more than 100.

00:01:22.545 --> 00:01:26.295
Chemotherapy drugs are delivered 
through pills and injections

00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:32.765
and use "cytotoxic agents," which means 
compounds that are toxic to living cells.

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:38.183
Essentially, these medicines cause some 
level of harm to all cells in the body—

00:01:38.183 --> 00:01:39.873
even healthy ones.

00:01:39.873 --> 00:01:44.783
But they reserve their most powerful 
effects for rapidly-dividing cells,

00:01:44.783 --> 00:01:48.353
which is precisely the hallmark of cancer.

00:01:48.353 --> 00:01:51.462
Take, for example, those first 
chemotherapy drugs,

00:01:51.462 --> 00:01:55.666
which are still used today and 
are called alkylating agents.

00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:57.570
They’re injected into the bloodstream,

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.760
which delivers them to 
cells all over the body.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.565
Once inside, when the cell exposes 
its DNA in order to copy it,

00:02:05.565 --> 00:02:09.635
they damage the building blocks of 
DNA’s double helix structure,

00:02:09.635 --> 00:02:13.373
which can lead to cell death unless 
the damage is repaired.

00:02:13.373 --> 00:02:16.164
Because cancer cells multiply rapidly,

00:02:16.164 --> 00:02:20.111
they take in a high concentration 
of alkylating agents,

00:02:20.111 --> 00:02:24.276
and their DNA is frequently exposed 
and rarely repaired.

00:02:24.276 --> 00:02:27.830
So they die off more often 
than most other cells,

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.175
which have time to fix damaged DNA

00:02:30.175 --> 00:02:34.651
and don’t accumulate the same 
concentrations of alkylating agents.

00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:40.610
Another form of chemotherapy involves 
compounds called microtubule stabilizers.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.440
Cells have small tubes that assemble 
to help with cell division

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.789
and DNA replication, then break back down.

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.977
When microtubule stabilizers 
get inside a cell,

00:02:50.977 --> 00:02:54.315
they keep those tiny tubes 
from disassembling.

00:02:54.315 --> 00:02:59.253
That prevents the cell from completing 
its replication, leading to its death.

00:02:59.253 --> 00:03:03.693
These are just two examples of the six 
classes of chemotherapy drugs

00:03:03.693 --> 00:03:06.235
we use to treat cancer today.

00:03:06.235 --> 00:03:11.112
But despite its huge benefits, 
chemotherapy has one big disadvantage:

00:03:11.112 --> 00:03:16.769
it affects other healthy cells in the body
that naturally have to renew rapidly.

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.489
Hair follicles, the cells of the mouth, 
the gastrointestinal lining,

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.443
the reproductive system, and bone marrow 
are hit nearly as hard as cancer.

00:03:27.443 --> 00:03:31.563
Similar to cancer cells, the rapid 
production of these normal cells

00:03:31.563 --> 00:03:34.803
means that they’re reaching for 
resources more frequently—

00:03:34.803 --> 00:03:38.896
and are therefore more exposed to 
the effects of chemo drugs.

00:03:38.896 --> 00:03:42.225
That leads to several common side 
effects of chemotherapy,

00:03:42.225 --> 00:03:47.284
including hair loss, fatigue, infertility,
nausea, and vomiting.

00:03:47.284 --> 00:03:51.214
Doctors commonly prescribe options 
to help manage these side-effects,

00:03:51.214 --> 00:03:54.001
such as strong anti-nausea medications.

00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:58.562
For hair loss, devices called cold caps 
can help lower the temperature

00:03:58.562 --> 00:04:01.807
around the head and 
constrict blood vessels,

00:04:01.807 --> 00:04:05.665
limiting the amount of chemotherapy 
drugs that reach hair follicles.

00:04:05.665 --> 00:04:08.527
And once a course of chemo 
treatment is over,

00:04:08.527 --> 00:04:12.594
the healthy tissues that’ve been badly 
affected by the drug will recover

00:04:12.594 --> 00:04:15.239
and begin to renew as usual.

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:21.643
In 2018 alone, over 17 million people 
world-wide received a cancer diagnosis.

00:04:21.643 --> 00:04:26.640
But chemotherapy and other treatments 
have changed the outlook for so many.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.475
Just take the fact that up to 95% of 
individuals with testicular cancer

00:04:31.475 --> 00:04:34.775
survive it, thanks to advances 
in treatment.

00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:39.590
Even in people with acute myeloid 
leukemia— an aggressive blood cancer—

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.750
chemotherapy puts an estimated 
60% of patients under 60

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.797
into remission following their 
first phase of treatment.

00:04:47.797 --> 00:04:51.354
Researchers are still developing 
more precise interventions

00:04:51.354 --> 00:04:54.546
that only target the intended 
cancer cells.

00:04:54.546 --> 00:04:58.093
That’ll help improve survival rates 
while leaving healthy tissues

00:04:58.093 --> 00:04:59.367
with reduced harm,

00:04:59.367 --> 00:05:03.869
making one of the best tools we have 
in the fight against cancer even better.
