00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.272
Check this out:

00:00:10.272 --> 00:00:14.769
Here's a grid, nothing special,
just a basic grid, very grid-y.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.546
But look closer, 
into this white spot at the center

00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:22.824
where the two central vertical
and horizontal lines intersect.

00:00:22.824 --> 00:00:26.545
Look very closely.
Notice anything funny about this spot?

00:00:26.545 --> 00:00:27.915
Yeah, nothing.

00:00:27.915 --> 00:00:30.686
But keep looking.
Get weird and stare at it.

00:00:30.686 --> 00:00:33.742
Now, keeping your gaze
fixed on this white spot,

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:36.689
check what's happening
in your peripheral vision.

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:43.697
The other spots, are they still white?
Or do they show weird flashes of grey?

00:00:43.697 --> 00:00:46.654
Now look at this pan for baking muffins.

00:00:46.654 --> 00:00:50.865
Oh, sorry, one of the cups is inverted.
It pops up instead of dipping down.

00:00:50.865 --> 00:00:54.994
Wait, no spin the pan.
The other five are domed now?

00:00:54.994 --> 00:00:58.475
Whichever it is, this pan's defective.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:02.168
Here's a photo of Abraham Lincoln,
and here's one upside down.

00:01:02.168 --> 00:01:03.866
Nothing weird going on here.

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:09.827
Wait, turn that upside down one right side up.
What have they done to Abe?

00:01:09.827 --> 00:01:13.491
Those are just three optical illusions,
images that seem to trick us.

00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:15.175
How do they work?

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:18.389
Are magical things happening
in the images themselves?

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:20.942
While we could certainly be
sneaking flashes of grey

00:01:20.942 --> 00:01:24.123
into the peripheral white spots
of our animated grid,

00:01:24.123 --> 00:01:26.417
first off, we promise we aren't.

00:01:26.417 --> 00:01:30.333
You'll see the same effect with a grid
printed on a plain old piece of paper.

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:35.855
In reality, this grid really is just a grid.
But not to your brain's visual system.

00:01:35.855 --> 00:01:40.615
Here's how it interprets the light
information you call this grid.

00:01:40.615 --> 00:01:46.170
The white intersections are surrounded by 
relatively more white on all four sides

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.437
than any white point along a line segment.

00:01:49.437 --> 00:01:54.231
Your retinal ganglion cells notice that
there is more white around the intersections

00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:59.632
because they are organized to
increase contrast with lateral inhibition.

00:01:59.632 --> 00:02:03.389
Better contrast means it's easier
to see the edge of something.

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:07.780
And things are what your eyes
and brain have evolved to see.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.633
Your retinal ganglion cells don't
respond as much at the crossings

00:02:11.633 --> 00:02:15.847
because there is more lateral inhibition
for more white spots nearby

00:02:15.847 --> 00:02:20.041
compared to the lines, 
which are surrounded by black.

00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:22.307
This isn't just a defect in your eyes;

00:02:22.307 --> 00:02:26.503
if you can see, then optical illusions
can trick you with your glasses on

00:02:26.503 --> 00:02:30.331
or with this paper or
computer screen right up in your face.

00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:32.355
What optical illusions show us

00:02:32.355 --> 00:02:37.025
is the way your photo receptors and brain
assemble visual information

00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:39.895
into the three-dimensional world
you see around you,

00:02:39.895 --> 00:02:42.169
where edges should get extra attention

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:45.789
because things with edges
can help you or kill you.

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:49.316
Look at that muffin pan again.
You know what causes confusion here?

00:02:49.316 --> 00:02:54.812
Your brain's visual cortex operates on
assumptions about the lighting of this image.

00:02:54.812 --> 00:02:59.222
It expects light to come from
a single source, shining down from above.

00:02:59.222 --> 00:03:03.573
And so these shading patterns could only
have been caused by light shining down

00:03:03.573 --> 00:03:07.131
on the sloping sides of a dome,
or the bottom of a hole.

00:03:07.131 --> 00:03:10.547
If we carefully recreate these clues
by drawing shading patterns,

00:03:10.547 --> 00:03:12.652
even on a flat piece of paper,

00:03:12.652 --> 00:03:17.319
our brain reflexively creates
the 3D concave or convex shape.

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.195
Now for that creepy Lincoln
upside down face.

00:03:20.195 --> 00:03:23.185
Faces trigger activity
in areas of the brain

00:03:23.185 --> 00:03:27.152
that have specifically evolved
to help us recognize faces.

00:03:27.152 --> 00:03:31.944
Like the fusiform face area and others
in the occipital and temporal lobes.

00:03:31.944 --> 00:03:34.974
It makes sense, too,
we're very social animals

00:03:34.974 --> 00:03:37.914
with highly complex ways of
interacting with each other.

00:03:37.914 --> 00:03:41.186
When we see faces,
we have to recognize they are faces

00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:44.475
and figure out what
they're expressing very quickly.

00:03:44.475 --> 00:03:47.769
And what we focus on most
are the eyes and mouth.

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.539
That's how we figure out if someone
is mad at us or wants to be our friend.

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:53.085
In the upside down Lincoln face,

00:03:53.085 --> 00:03:56.104
the eyes and mouth were
actually right side up,

00:03:56.104 --> 00:03:58.302
so you didn't notice anything was off.

00:03:58.302 --> 00:04:01.819
But when we flipped the whole image over,
the most important parts of the face,

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.617
the eyes and mouth, were now upside down,
and you realized something fishy was up.

00:04:06.617 --> 00:04:10.770
You realized your brain had taken
a short cut and missed something.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.938
But your brain wasn't really being lazy,
it's just very busy.

00:04:14.938 --> 00:04:18.454
So it spends cognitive energy
as efficiently as possible,

00:04:18.454 --> 00:04:24.595
using assumptions about visual information
to create a tailored, edited vision of the world.

00:04:24.595 --> 00:04:27.641
Imagine your brain
calling out these edits on the fly:

00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:29.732
"Okay, those squares could be objects.

00:04:29.732 --> 00:04:33.724
Let's enhance that black-white contrast
on the sides with lateral inhibition.

00:04:33.724 --> 00:04:34.948
Darken those corners!

00:04:34.948 --> 00:04:36.874
Dark grey fading into light grey?

00:04:36.874 --> 00:04:39.891
Assume overhead sunlight
falling on a sloping curve. Next!

00:04:39.891 --> 00:04:43.782
Those eyes look like most eyes I've seen before,
nothing weird going on here."

00:04:43.782 --> 00:04:47.380
See? Our visual tricks have
revealed your brain's job

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.012
as a busy director of 3D animation
in a studio inside your skull,

00:04:52.012 --> 00:04:56.270
allocating cognitive energy and
constructing a world on the fly

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.020
with tried and mostly -- but not always -- true
tricks of its own.
