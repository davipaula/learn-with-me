Stephanie Busari: President Ameenah,
thank you for joining us.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.278
Even as TED speakers go,
you're something of an overachiever.

00:00:21.016 --> 00:00:22.419
Ameenah Gurib-Fakim: (Laughs)

00:00:22.443 --> 00:00:25.354
SB: You have a PhD in organic chemistry,

00:00:25.378 --> 00:00:28.036
you were vice chancellor
of the University of Mauritius,

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.761
a successful entrepreneur,

00:00:29.785 --> 00:00:33.474
you've won numerous awards
for your work in science

00:00:33.498 --> 00:00:37.011
and you're the first Muslim
female head of state in Africa.

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:39.819
(Applause)

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:45.374
And of course, you're no stranger
to the TEDGlobal stage;

00:00:45.398 --> 00:00:47.623
you gave a talk in 2014.

00:00:48.357 --> 00:00:51.749
Did you have any political
ambitions at that time?

00:00:51.773 --> 00:00:55.151
How did you go from academic to president?

00:00:55.175 --> 00:00:56.716
AGF: OK, thanks, Stephanie.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.497
First of all, I'd like to thank TED

00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:01.127
for having given me
the opportunity to be here today.

00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:04.860
And I would also like to thank
the government of Tanzania

00:01:04.884 --> 00:01:08.229
and the president for the welcome.

00:01:08.253 --> 00:01:11.679
And also, I'd like to thank
the contribution of our consul,

00:01:11.703 --> 00:01:13.136
Mr. Rizvi, who's here,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.614
has been very supportive
for all our stay here.

00:01:16.638 --> 00:01:19.120
Now, to answer your question,

00:01:19.144 --> 00:01:22.106
did I have any ambitions in politics?

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.064
The straight answer is no.

00:01:24.088 --> 00:01:26.388
I did not choose the world of politics;

00:01:26.412 --> 00:01:28.247
the world of politics chose me.

00:01:28.271 --> 00:01:29.421
So here I am.

00:01:29.852 --> 00:01:31.509
(Applause)

00:01:32.181 --> 00:01:34.483
SB: So, was there ever
anything in your journey

00:01:34.507 --> 00:01:36.360
that ever made you think

00:01:36.384 --> 00:01:39.368
that one day you would become
president of your country?

00:01:39.392 --> 00:01:40.681
Did you ever imagine that?

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:41.857
AGF: Absolutely not.

00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:45.323
I think the journey started
immediately after TED, actually.

00:01:45.347 --> 00:01:48.888
When I went back,
this journalist called me and said,

00:01:48.912 --> 00:01:52.412
"You know, your name has been cited
for the president of the republic,"

00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:54.266
I said, "Ma'am, you must be mistaken,

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.203
because I have no ambition whatsoever."

00:01:56.227 --> 00:01:57.571
She said, "No, it's serious.

00:01:57.595 --> 00:02:01.002
Can you come and tell me this
in the form of a declaration?

00:02:01.026 --> 00:02:02.563
So, OK, you'll come?"

00:02:02.587 --> 00:02:05.221
So, of course, as good journalists go,

00:02:05.245 --> 00:02:07.496
the next day I see my TED picture

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.220
and, with my name, Ameenah Gurib-Fakim,

00:02:10.244 --> 00:02:11.504
"For president?"

00:02:11.528 --> 00:02:13.574
A very small interrogation mark --

00:02:13.598 --> 00:02:15.811
and people don't see
the interrogation mark,

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:18.502
they just see my name
and they see my picture.

00:02:18.526 --> 00:02:20.257
And that was a sounding board.

00:02:20.686 --> 00:02:23.571
And again, as you have just said,

00:02:23.595 --> 00:02:26.349
it was a very interesting scenario

00:02:26.373 --> 00:02:30.568
because it was a scenario
where they wanted to have somebody

00:02:30.592 --> 00:02:32.129
who was credible,

00:02:32.153 --> 00:02:34.953
had this political neutrality

00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:37.378
and at the same time, was for a minority

00:02:37.402 --> 00:02:40.036
because Islam is a minority
religion in Mauritius,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.442
because in Mauritius,
we stratify people's origins

00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:46.256
by virtue of their religious belief.

00:02:46.694 --> 00:02:48.466
And -- I was a woman.

00:02:48.878 --> 00:02:50.817
So this made it all very interesting.

00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:54.092
So there we go, and this
whole campaign started,

00:02:54.116 --> 00:02:55.700
and then people said, "Why not?"

00:02:55.724 --> 00:02:57.977
Now, this is very important
to note, Stephanie,

00:02:58.001 --> 00:03:02.111
because normally, the president
is elected after the election.

00:03:02.135 --> 00:03:03.546
And here we had a scenario

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.271
where the name of the president
was flagged before the election process,

00:03:09.295 --> 00:03:10.465
during the campaign.

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.912
So when people voted,
they knew that at some point,

00:03:12.936 --> 00:03:15.610
they would have
this Muslim woman president.

00:03:16.132 --> 00:03:18.543
SB: Does it feel significant
to you as a woman

00:03:18.567 --> 00:03:21.656
to be the first female president
of your country?

00:03:22.224 --> 00:03:24.883
AGF: It's important for many reasons.

00:03:24.907 --> 00:03:28.981
I think, obviously, you just mentioned
the terrible statistics

00:03:29.005 --> 00:03:32.959
of two female presidents
in the whole of Africa.

00:03:32.983 --> 00:03:34.754
But more importantly,

00:03:34.778 --> 00:03:39.405
I think it's important also coming
from the background I come from --

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:45.316
by background I mean not ethnic,
but more academic and entrepreneurial --

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.491
to be there,

00:03:46.515 --> 00:03:50.232
to be that role model for that little girl
growing in my village

00:03:50.256 --> 00:03:51.727
to say, "Yes, it's possible."

00:03:51.751 --> 00:03:52.901
It's possible.

00:03:53.386 --> 00:03:56.009
(Applause)

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.468
It's also important, Stephanie,

00:03:59.492 --> 00:04:01.656
while I talk about diversity --

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.317
diversity in the widest sense of the word.

00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:08.910
We've seen that whenever
there was diversity,

00:04:08.934 --> 00:04:10.646
whenever there was openness,

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.454
whenever there was dialogue,

00:04:12.478 --> 00:04:15.703
this was the time when societies
have been most productive.

00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:18.676
When we talk about the Arab Golden Age,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.996
we cannot not think of Ibn Sina,

00:04:22.468 --> 00:04:23.989
al-Haytham,

00:04:24.013 --> 00:04:25.205
Averroes,

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:26.386
Maimonides.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.959
This was a time
when cultures, religions --

00:04:29.983 --> 00:04:31.557
they were talking to each other.

00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:33.277
They were at peace with each other.

00:04:33.301 --> 00:04:35.850
And this was a time
when they were highly productive.

00:04:35.874 --> 00:04:37.938
So I would say: bring down these walls.

00:04:37.962 --> 00:04:39.684
SB: Absolutely, absolutely.

00:04:39.708 --> 00:04:42.379
(Applause)

00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:44.380
AGF: Virtual or otherwise.

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:48.297
SB: Let's also talk about
another conflict area

00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:51.722
which you straddle quite interestingly.

00:04:51.746 --> 00:04:55.151
As a woman of faith and also a scientist,

00:04:55.175 --> 00:04:58.971
you know, faith and science
seem to be at loggerheads.

00:04:58.995 --> 00:05:00.346
It wasn't always so,

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.404
but I'm interested to get your thoughts
on how you reconcile both

00:05:05.428 --> 00:05:08.095
and how they coexist for you personally.

00:05:09.044 --> 00:05:11.114
AGF: They're not mutually exclusive.

00:05:11.138 --> 00:05:13.609
I mean, if you're a scientist,

00:05:13.633 --> 00:05:17.895
you tend to really look
at the perfection of the human body,

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.094
the way it functions.

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:20.968
If you look at nature as a whole.

00:05:20.992 --> 00:05:24.043
I'm still amazed at the perfection

00:05:24.067 --> 00:05:27.343
with which the entire
ecosystem functions together.

00:05:27.367 --> 00:05:32.079
However, to the purists,
to those who are of faith,

00:05:32.103 --> 00:05:34.777
they will tell you, "Yes,
there has been evolution."

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:38.597
Even the Pope has agreed
that evolution exists.

00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:41.311
But there's always the question:
What came first?

00:05:41.335 --> 00:05:42.643
What came before this?

00:05:42.667 --> 00:05:46.571
When we talk about all
the various strata of evolution,

00:05:46.595 --> 00:05:48.468
we'll always be asking the question,

00:05:48.492 --> 00:05:50.087
there must be something before.

00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:51.946
So I'm of the opinion that yes,

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.564
there is this great spiritual force
which is guiding the process,

00:05:56.588 --> 00:05:59.895
and things like this
don't happen by chance.

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.105
Now, whether you call it religiosity,

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:05.634
whether you call
this great spirit by any name --

00:06:05.658 --> 00:06:08.516
Brahma, Allah, the Holy Trinity --

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.716
you name it --

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.012
but I still think that these two
are not mutually exclusive.

00:06:13.036 --> 00:06:15.433
They can still coexist with each other.

00:06:16.257 --> 00:06:20.047
SB: So let's move
to one of your passions -- science.

00:06:20.071 --> 00:06:21.747
You've made no secret of that.

00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:24.252
And you've always been
passionate about science.

00:06:24.722 --> 00:06:26.935
I read that when you were
a very young girl,

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:29.469
you went to a career guidance counselor

00:06:29.493 --> 00:06:32.226
and told them you wanted
to become a chemist,

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.931
and they said, "No, it's for boys.

00:06:35.955 --> 00:06:37.613
Boys do science."

00:06:37.637 --> 00:06:41.604
Did that make you even more
determined to study science

00:06:41.628 --> 00:06:43.072
and to succeed in that field?

00:06:43.096 --> 00:06:45.702
How did you respond to that?

00:06:45.726 --> 00:06:47.014
AGF: Well, to begin with,

00:06:47.038 --> 00:06:50.394
I must say, before I came
to that career guidance officer,

00:06:50.418 --> 00:06:53.580
I had great teachers who motivated.

00:06:53.604 --> 00:06:56.562
And this is something I would like
to draw attention to again,

00:06:56.586 --> 00:06:58.164
to our education system.

00:06:58.188 --> 00:07:00.417
We have to do away
with this rote learning.

00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:04.365
We have to ensure that we drive
this curiosity in the child,

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:05.997
and they need to be curious.

00:07:06.021 --> 00:07:10.455
And if we want to move along the line
for them to become great scientists,

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:13.551
they need to become more and more
curious in everything they do.

00:07:13.575 --> 00:07:16.581
So every time -- exactly --
I went to see the careers guidance,

00:07:16.605 --> 00:07:19.020
he looked at me and said,
"What do you want to do?"

00:07:19.044 --> 00:07:20.785
I said, "I want to study chemistry."

00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:23.730
"Well, you shouldn't study chemistry
because this is for boys.

00:07:23.754 --> 00:07:26.992
And the next thing, when you come
back, there'll be no job for you."

00:07:27.016 --> 00:07:28.170
So I went back home,

00:07:28.194 --> 00:07:31.420
and I had a great cheerleader at home
who happens to be my father.

00:07:31.444 --> 00:07:34.495
He said, "What do you want to do?"
and asked, "What did he say?"

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:37.938
I said, "This is what he said ..."
He said, "What are you going to do?"

00:07:37.962 --> 00:07:39.703
I said, "I'm going to do chemistry."

00:07:39.727 --> 00:07:40.978
So there I was.

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:44.460
And one thing I will say:
one must always follow your heart.

00:07:44.484 --> 00:07:46.535
And my heart was always in chemistry.

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:48.641
I did what I was passionate about,

00:07:48.665 --> 00:07:51.969
and I thought at some point
that I had developed this thinking

00:07:51.993 --> 00:07:54.276
that if you're passionate
about what you do,

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.752
you will not have to work
a single day in your life,

00:07:56.776 --> 00:07:59.368
until I realized it was
Confucius who said that.

00:07:59.392 --> 00:08:01.123
(Laughter)

00:08:01.847 --> 00:08:07.123
SB: So do you feel a responsibility,
as someone in your position,

00:08:07.147 --> 00:08:10.322
to encourage young girls,
especially on this continent,

00:08:10.346 --> 00:08:14.463
to study STEM subjects?

00:08:14.487 --> 00:08:17.208
Is that something
that you actively work --

00:08:17.232 --> 00:08:19.586
AGF: You know, over the past
two days, Stephanie,

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.598
we've been hearing a lot of conversation

00:08:21.622 --> 00:08:23.585
about the sustainable development goals.

00:08:23.609 --> 00:08:25.039
We've seen that, for example,

00:08:25.063 --> 00:08:26.485
Africa must be food secure,

00:08:26.509 --> 00:08:28.608
Africa must be energy secure,

00:08:28.632 --> 00:08:30.446
Africa must be water secure.

00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:33.969
If we want to get
to that level of development --

00:08:33.993 --> 00:08:36.796
Agenda 2030 is not very far away --

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.504
if you want to have success,

00:08:38.528 --> 00:08:43.559
we need to have
an educated youth in Africa.

00:08:43.583 --> 00:08:45.908
And again, to be very cliché:

00:08:45.932 --> 00:08:49.697
you cannot achieve,
you cannot win a football match,

00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:54.145
if you're going to leave 52 percent
of the team outside.

00:08:54.169 --> 00:08:55.717
It's not possible.

00:08:56.144 --> 00:08:59.129
(Applause)

00:08:59.554 --> 00:09:00.709
SB: Yes.

00:09:00.733 --> 00:09:02.560
AGF: So we need highly educated,

00:09:02.584 --> 00:09:04.369
we need female intuition,

00:09:04.393 --> 00:09:06.242
and we need to get them there.

00:09:06.266 --> 00:09:09.818
And this is where a great deal
of effort has to be done

00:09:09.842 --> 00:09:12.383
to actually motivate
them from a very young age,

00:09:12.407 --> 00:09:15.043
to tell that girl
that she can do anything.

00:09:15.582 --> 00:09:17.954
And if the message comes from her father,

00:09:17.978 --> 00:09:20.004
if the message comes from her brother,

00:09:20.028 --> 00:09:21.558
it's even much more powerful.

00:09:21.582 --> 00:09:24.094
We need to tell her
that anything is possible

00:09:24.118 --> 00:09:25.284
and she can do it.

00:09:25.308 --> 00:09:28.911
We need to build her self-confidence
from a very early age,

00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:30.204
but more importantly,

00:09:30.228 --> 00:09:32.826
we also need to actually
look at the books,

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.166
because there are too many stereotypes.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.866
Last year, I was very shocked
when I went to a debate on Women's Day.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:40.076
They had a survey,

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:44.681
and they were asking these girls
how many women inventors we have,

00:09:44.705 --> 00:09:47.198
how many women scientists do we have.

00:09:47.222 --> 00:09:50.324
And you'd be shocked
that hardly anyone knew

00:09:50.348 --> 00:09:53.542
that Ada Lovelace was there
behind computer science,

00:09:53.566 --> 00:09:57.306
that Marie Curie still remains iconic
with two Nobel prizes.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:00.732
So there's a lot of homework to do
to actually make --

00:10:00.756 --> 00:10:05.020
to remove all these gender biases
at a very young age;

00:10:05.044 --> 00:10:07.227
instill that confidence in that girl;

00:10:07.251 --> 00:10:11.499
to tell her that she can do as well
if not better than her brother.

00:10:11.523 --> 00:10:12.674
SB: Yes.

00:10:12.698 --> 00:10:15.779
(Applause)

00:10:16.759 --> 00:10:17.910
Thank you.

00:10:17.934 --> 00:10:22.643
So, let's move on to an area
that I know you've been very active in,

00:10:22.667 --> 00:10:24.968
which is the issue of biodiversity.

00:10:24.992 --> 00:10:30.542
You've been quite clear that this
is an area that Africa must embrace.

00:10:30.566 --> 00:10:34.965
We have an abundance of rich
herbal traditions and plants

00:10:34.989 --> 00:10:39.062
that could be developed
into a big pharmaceutical industry.

00:10:39.086 --> 00:10:43.104
Can you tell us a little bit
of how you've been using your expertise

00:10:43.128 --> 00:10:45.862
to harness growth in this area?

00:10:46.432 --> 00:10:47.583
AGF: Thank you.

00:10:47.607 --> 00:10:49.912
Yesterday, I was listening
to one of the talks;

00:10:49.936 --> 00:10:54.201
it was the talk about the need for Africa
to turn into a knowledge economy.

00:10:54.225 --> 00:10:57.312
Africa has got very rich traditions.

00:10:57.336 --> 00:10:59.876
Sub-Saharan Africa, southern Africa,

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.994
has got over 5,000
medicinal plant species,

00:11:03.018 --> 00:11:04.217
not harnessed.

00:11:04.241 --> 00:11:07.162
And, in fact, at the TED talk
I gave in 2014,

00:11:07.186 --> 00:11:09.039
I came out with one sentence:

00:11:09.063 --> 00:11:12.134
"Biodiversity underpins life on earth."

00:11:12.158 --> 00:11:15.299
And if we don't look after
this biodiversity,

00:11:15.323 --> 00:11:16.795
if we don't protect it,

00:11:16.819 --> 00:11:20.336
if we don't actually
harness it in the right way,

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.154
we are threatening
our own livelihoods on this planet.

00:11:24.178 --> 00:11:28.847
When we talk about the contribution
from countries of the north

00:11:28.871 --> 00:11:32.427
to the Green Fund
for the protection of our planet,

00:11:32.451 --> 00:11:34.108
it is not charity.

00:11:34.544 --> 00:11:39.540
It is to ensure our own collective
livelihoods on this planet.

00:11:39.564 --> 00:11:41.667
So this is something
that must be addressed.

00:11:41.691 --> 00:11:43.536
Now, again, when you talk about

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.328
getting this biodiversity
of Africa working for us,

00:11:47.352 --> 00:11:48.658
you'd be shocked to know

00:11:48.682 --> 00:11:55.045
that out of the 1,100 blockbuster drugs
that we have on the market,

00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:58.842
only 83 come from African plants.

00:11:58.866 --> 00:12:00.256
Why is this so?

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.177
Because we are responsible;

00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:03.391
us Africans.

00:12:03.415 --> 00:12:06.224
We don't value
our own traditional knowledge.

00:12:06.621 --> 00:12:11.164
We don't give it the same status
as allopathic medicine.

00:12:11.188 --> 00:12:12.781
Look at what China has done.

00:12:12.805 --> 00:12:17.001
China has given the same status
for traditional Chinese medicine

00:12:17.025 --> 00:12:18.583
as allopathic medicine,

00:12:18.607 --> 00:12:20.494
as of 2016.

00:12:21.482 --> 00:12:24.953
Our governments, our people,
have not documented,

00:12:24.977 --> 00:12:27.576
have not taken this knowledge seriously.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:34.569
If you want to get serious about Africa
becoming a knowledge continent,

00:12:34.593 --> 00:12:37.334
this is something that we need
to address very seriously,

00:12:37.358 --> 00:12:38.799
we need to start documenting,

00:12:38.823 --> 00:12:40.889
we need to start codifying this knowledge,

00:12:40.913 --> 00:12:43.746
and unfortunately,
we are racing against time

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:48.591
because tradition in Africa is that
the transmission has always been oral.

00:12:48.615 --> 00:12:51.603
So we need to get our act together
and make it happen.

00:12:51.627 --> 00:12:54.245
SB: So there's really a sense
of urgency around this.

00:12:54.269 --> 00:12:55.577
AGF: Yes.

00:12:55.601 --> 00:12:59.040
(Applause)

00:12:59.064 --> 00:13:03.996
SB: And have you done anything yourself
in respect to documenting --

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.787
AGF: Yes, I definitely did.

00:13:05.811 --> 00:13:08.722
When I started my career in academia,

00:13:08.746 --> 00:13:12.069
one of the first things I did
was I documented precisely these plants.

00:13:12.093 --> 00:13:15.582
And I'll tell you one thing --
it was not perceived to be very serious,

00:13:15.606 --> 00:13:18.834
because here I was,
in synthetic organic chemistry,

00:13:18.858 --> 00:13:22.164
going out there,
talking to these grandmothers,

00:13:22.188 --> 00:13:24.182
documenting their recipes.

00:13:24.206 --> 00:13:27.432
I mean, you can't be serious --
bringing weeds in the lab,

00:13:27.456 --> 00:13:29.688
and say, "We're going
to be working on these."

00:13:29.712 --> 00:13:31.187
Are we going to get results?

00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:35.158
So it was really a race against prejudice

00:13:35.182 --> 00:13:37.917
to try to take people's --

00:13:37.941 --> 00:13:41.042
bring them to the table and say,
"Look, this is very important."

00:13:41.066 --> 00:13:42.218
But I'm glad I did,

00:13:42.242 --> 00:13:45.105
because by that time, you start
developing a crocodile skin,

00:13:45.129 --> 00:13:48.204
especially when you're a woman in the lab
doing different things.

00:13:48.228 --> 00:13:49.771
You know -- you become suspect.

00:13:49.795 --> 00:13:52.101
So I documented it; I'm very happy I did.

00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:55.693
And now, almost 20 years
since the documentation,

00:13:55.717 --> 00:13:57.698
it now constitutes prior art,

00:13:57.722 --> 00:13:59.796
and is now very well-documented at WIPO,

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.822
and it is now the information which,

00:14:02.846 --> 00:14:07.054
subsequently, my company actually
started working on as well.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:11.194
SB: So, I watched you in the makeup room

00:14:11.218 --> 00:14:13.680
taking selfies with the makeup artist,

00:14:13.704 --> 00:14:16.615
and just being generally very accessible.

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:17.847
And it strikes me

00:14:17.871 --> 00:14:21.387
that you're not the kind of typical,
big-man, African leader.

00:14:21.411 --> 00:14:22.569
You seem very --

00:14:22.593 --> 00:14:24.927
AGF: You just demoted me.
You called me a man.

00:14:24.951 --> 00:14:25.998
(Laughter)

00:14:26.022 --> 00:14:27.256
SB: I mean your style --

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.490
(Applause)

00:14:28.514 --> 00:14:34.898
Your style seems to be very accessible
and quite unassuming.

00:14:34.922 --> 00:14:36.448
So is this --

00:14:36.472 --> 00:14:39.785
I mean, people tend to ask women leaders

00:14:39.809 --> 00:14:44.778
if their gender has a bearing
on the way they rule,

00:14:44.802 --> 00:14:46.795
or the way they lead.

00:14:46.819 --> 00:14:49.403
Does that apply to you?

00:14:49.427 --> 00:14:51.783
AGF: You know, I've never
taken myself seriously.

00:14:51.807 --> 00:14:52.958
SB: OK. That's good.

00:14:52.982 --> 00:14:54.196
(Laughter)

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:55.371
AGF: I still don't.

00:14:55.395 --> 00:14:58.285
And I don't think you should
take yourself seriously.

00:14:58.309 --> 00:15:00.496
You need to have trust in what you can do,

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.294
have confidence in yourself

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:05.975
and give yourself a set of goals
and just work towards them.

00:15:05.999 --> 00:15:10.089
So the goal I've given myself is,
OK, I'm leading my third life --

00:15:10.113 --> 00:15:13.547
because I've been an academic,
I've been an entrepreneur, now I'm here.

00:15:13.571 --> 00:15:15.184
I'm hoping to have a fourth life.

00:15:15.208 --> 00:15:17.991
So put these to work for the continent.

00:15:18.015 --> 00:15:22.599
And this is why I have chosen
to give my voice to so many initiatives

00:15:22.623 --> 00:15:26.551
that would help the youth of Africa
become tech-savvy,

00:15:26.575 --> 00:15:27.975
become science-savvy,

00:15:27.999 --> 00:15:29.620
because as I said earlier on,

00:15:29.644 --> 00:15:33.642
up until they get to grips with science,

00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:38.334
with whatever is around --
media, technology, you name it,

00:15:38.358 --> 00:15:42.697
all calls for a good grounding in science,
technology and innovation.

00:15:42.721 --> 00:15:44.003
I think we'll be here,

00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:45.957
10 years, 20 years down the line,

00:15:45.981 --> 00:15:47.628
having the same conversation.

00:15:48.041 --> 00:15:50.075
SB: Let's talk quickly
about the challenges

00:15:50.099 --> 00:15:52.536
of leadership and governance.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.967
It's hard to ignore
that there's corruption on this continent

00:15:57.991 --> 00:15:59.688
with some of our leaders.

00:15:59.712 --> 00:16:03.259
How have you confronted that in your role,

00:16:03.283 --> 00:16:08.640
and what experiences can you
share with us around this issue?

00:16:08.664 --> 00:16:10.072
AGF: We've had corruption --

00:16:10.096 --> 00:16:12.043
corruption doesn't exist only in Africa.

00:16:12.067 --> 00:16:14.378
Where there is a corruptee,
there is a corrupter.

00:16:14.402 --> 00:16:17.021
Right? It's always a two-way process.

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:20.325
We have focused in my country,

00:16:20.349 --> 00:16:24.572
we are working very hard towards
doing something about corruption,

00:16:24.596 --> 00:16:27.095
but, you know, they also have
great people in Africa.

00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:30.297
Why do we always focus on the negative?
Why don't we talk about ...

00:16:30.321 --> 00:16:34.561
I want to bring on board, for example,
the great quotes of Nelson Mandela.

00:16:34.585 --> 00:16:36.982
His legacy is still very much alive.

00:16:37.006 --> 00:16:40.708
We have people in -- even in Tanzania,
we've had Julius Nyerere,

00:16:40.732 --> 00:16:42.016
he have Nkrumah,

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.324
we have Kenyatta,

00:16:43.348 --> 00:16:46.134
we have all these people
who have been champions of Africa.

00:16:46.158 --> 00:16:48.823
I think we need to take
pages of their book and see.

00:16:48.847 --> 00:16:52.832
In fact, Julius Nyerere himself
had been a great advocate for science

00:16:52.856 --> 00:16:56.672
when he said that "science
will make deserts bloom."

00:16:56.696 --> 00:17:00.365
So these are some of the founding
fathers of this continent;

00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:02.025
we need to take pages from them

00:17:02.049 --> 00:17:03.360
and move ahead.

00:17:03.384 --> 00:17:05.865
(Applause)

00:17:05.889 --> 00:17:07.859
SB: Thank you very much,
President Fakim.

00:17:07.893 --> 00:17:09.069
AGF: Thank you.

00:17:09.093 --> 00:17:10.915
(Applause)
