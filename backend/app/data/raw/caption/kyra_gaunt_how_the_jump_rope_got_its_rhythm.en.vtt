00:00:12.206 --> 00:00:14.666
If you do it right, it should sound like:

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.569
TICK-tat, TICK-tat, TICK-tat,
TICK-tat, TICK-tat, TICK-tat.

00:00:18.593 --> 00:00:20.300
If you do it wrong, it sounds like:

00:00:20.324 --> 00:00:21.823
Tick-TAT, tick-TAT, tick-TAT.

00:00:21.848 --> 00:00:24.699
[Small thing. Big idea.]

00:00:25.574 --> 00:00:27.460
[Kyra Gaunt on
the Jump Rope]

00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:31.754
The jump rope is such a simple object.

00:00:31.918 --> 00:00:34.517
It can be made out of rope,
a clothesline, twine.

00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:37.067
It has, like, a twirl on it. (Laughs)

00:00:37.091 --> 00:00:38.863
I'm not sure how to describe that.

00:00:38.887 --> 00:00:41.392
What's important
is that it has a certain weight,

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:44.793
and that they have
that kind of whip sound.

00:00:44.817 --> 00:00:48.615
It's not clear what the origin
of the jump rope is.

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:52.575
There's some evidence
that it began in ancient Egypt, Phoenicia,

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:56.671
and then it most likely traveled
to North America with Dutch settlers.

00:00:56.695 --> 00:01:01.333
The rope became a big thing
when women's clothes became more fitted

00:01:01.357 --> 00:01:03.635
and the pantaloon came into being.

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.539
And so, girls were able to jump rope

00:01:06.563 --> 00:01:09.269
because their skirts
wouldn't catch the ropes.

00:01:09.293 --> 00:01:13.173
Governesses used it
to train their wards to jump rope.

00:01:13.197 --> 00:01:16.438
Even formerly enslaved African children
in the antebellum South

00:01:16.462 --> 00:01:17.904
jumped rope, too.

00:01:17.928 --> 00:01:22.539
In the 1950s, in Harlem,
Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens,

00:01:22.563 --> 00:01:27.039
you could see on the sidewalk,
lots of girls playing with ropes.

00:01:27.063 --> 00:01:30.785
Sometimes they would take two ropes
and turn them as a single rope together,

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:34.595
but you could separate them and turn
them in like an eggbeater on each other.

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.132
The skipping rope
was like a steady timeline --

00:01:37.156 --> 00:01:38.673
tick, tick, tick, tick --

00:01:38.697 --> 00:01:42.759
upon which you can add rhymes
and rhythms and chants.

00:01:42.783 --> 00:01:44.831
Those ropes created a space

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:47.077
where we were able
to contribute to something

00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:49.211
that was far greater
than the neighborhood.

00:01:49.602 --> 00:01:53.288
Double Dutch jump rope remains
a powerful symbol of culture and identity

00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:54.465
for black women.

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:56.807
Back from the 1950s to the 1970s,

00:01:56.831 --> 00:01:58.966
girls weren't supposed to play sports.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.791
Boys played baseball,
basketball and football,

00:02:01.815 --> 00:02:03.156
and girls weren't allowed.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.704
A lot has changed, but in that era,

00:02:05.728 --> 00:02:07.569
girls would rule the playground.

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:10.013
They'd make sure
that boys weren't a part of that.

00:02:10.037 --> 00:02:12.283
It's their space, it's a girl-power space.

00:02:12.307 --> 00:02:14.403
It's where they get to shine.

00:02:14.427 --> 00:02:15.989
But I also think it's for boys,

00:02:16.013 --> 00:02:17.489
because boys overheard those,

00:02:17.513 --> 00:02:19.957
which is why, I think,
so many hip-hop artists

00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:23.277
sampled from things that they heard
in black girls' game songs.

00:02:23.301 --> 00:02:26.377
(Chanting) ... cold, thick shake,
act like you know how to flip,

00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:29.402
Filet-O-Fish, Quarter Pounder,
french fries, ice cold, thick shake,

00:02:29.426 --> 00:02:30.881
act like you know how to jump.

00:02:30.905 --> 00:02:34.925
Why "Country Grammar" by Nelly
became a Grammy Award-winning single

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:37.307
was because people already knew

00:02:37.331 --> 00:02:40.806
"We're going down down baby
your street in a Range Rover ... "

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.243
That's the beginning of "Down down, baby,
down down the roller coaster,

00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:46.696
sweet, sweet baby, I'll never let you go."

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.569
All people who grew up
in any black urban community

00:02:49.593 --> 00:02:51.878
would know that music.

00:02:51.902 --> 00:02:54.124
And so, it was a ready-made hit.

00:02:54.656 --> 00:02:58.775
The Double Dutch rope playing
helped maintain these songs

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.800
and helped maintain the chants
and the gestures that go along with it,

00:03:02.824 --> 00:03:06.831
which is very natural
to what I call "kinetic orality" --

00:03:06.855 --> 00:03:08.656
word of mouth and word of body.

00:03:09.133 --> 00:03:12.006
It's the thing that gets
passed down over generations.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.961
In some ways, the rope
is the thing that helps carry it.

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:18.569
You need some object
to carry memory through.

00:03:18.943 --> 00:03:22.887
So, a jump rope, you can use it
for all different kinds of things.

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:24.466
It crosses cultures.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.495
And I think it lasted
because people need to move.

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.906
And I think sometimes the simplest objects
can make the most creative uses.
