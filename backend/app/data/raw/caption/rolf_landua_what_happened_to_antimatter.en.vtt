00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:19.252
Is it possible to create something out of nothing?

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:22.880
Or, more precisely, can energy be made into matter?

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.782
Yes, but only when it comes together

00:00:24.782 --> 00:00:27.602
with its twin, antimatter.

00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:31.016
And there's something pretty mysterious about antimatter:

00:00:31.016 --> 00:00:35.059
there's way less of it out there than there should be.

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.116
Let's start with the most famous physics formula ever:

00:00:38.116 --> 00:00:40.437
E equals m c squared.

00:00:40.437 --> 00:00:43.732
It basically says that mass is concentrated energy,

00:00:43.732 --> 00:00:46.730
and mass and energy are exchangeable,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.143
like two currencies with a huge exchange rate.

00:00:50.143 --> 00:00:51.664
90 trillion Joules of energy

00:00:51.664 --> 00:00:54.121
are equivalent to 1 gram of mass.

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:57.791
But how do I actually transform energy into matter?

00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:01.136
The magic word is &lt;i&gt;energy density&lt;/i&gt;.

00:01:01.136 --> 00:01:03.503
If you concentrate a huge amount

00:01:03.503 --> 00:01:05.548
of energy in a tiny space,

00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:08.879
new particles will come into existence.

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:09.836
If we look closer,

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:13.198
we see that these particles always come in pairs,

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:14.514
like twins.

00:01:14.514 --> 00:01:17.644
That's because particles always have a counterpart,

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:19.115
an antiparticle,

00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:20.898
and these are always produced

00:01:20.898 --> 00:01:24.153
in exactly equal amounts: 50/50.

00:01:24.153 --> 00:01:25.861
This might sound like science fiction,

00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:29.365
but it's the daily life of particle accelerators.

00:01:29.365 --> 00:01:31.784
In the collisions between two protons

00:01:31.784 --> 00:01:34.035
at CERN's Large Hadron Collider,

00:01:34.035 --> 00:01:36.247
billions of particles and antiparticles

00:01:36.247 --> 00:01:38.249
are produced every second.

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:40.748
Consider, for example, the electron.

00:01:40.748 --> 00:01:44.492
It has a very small mass and negative electric charge.

00:01:44.492 --> 00:01:46.598
It's antiparticle, the positron,

00:01:46.598 --> 00:01:48.383
has exactly the same mass,

00:01:48.383 --> 00:01:51.237
but a positive electric charge.

00:01:51.237 --> 00:01:53.472
But, apart from the opposite charges,

00:01:53.472 --> 00:01:56.857
both particles are identical and perfectly stable.

00:01:56.857 --> 00:01:59.230
And the same is true for their heavy cousins,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.220
the proton and the antiproton.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.366
Therefore, scientists are convinced

00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:04.969
that a world made of antimatter

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:09.332
would look, feel, and smell just like our world.

00:02:09.332 --> 00:02:11.137
In this antiworld,

00:02:11.137 --> 00:02:13.418
we may find antiwater,

00:02:13.418 --> 00:02:14.670
antigold,

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.377
and, for example,

00:02:16.377 --> 00:02:17.875
an antimarble.

00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:19.882
Now imagine that a marble and an antimarble

00:02:19.882 --> 00:02:21.384
are brought together.

00:02:21.384 --> 00:02:23.400
These two apparently solid objects

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.221
would completely disappear

00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:26.933
into a big flash of energy,

00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:29.472
equivalent to an atomic bomb.

00:02:29.472 --> 00:02:31.809
Because combining matter and antimatter

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:33.647
would create so much energy,

00:02:33.647 --> 00:02:35.602
science fiction is full of ideas

00:02:35.602 --> 00:02:38.609
about harnessing the energy stored in antimatter,

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.574
for example, to fuel spaceships like Star Trek.

00:02:41.574 --> 00:02:44.434
After all, the energy content of antimatter

00:02:44.434 --> 00:02:47.577
is a billion times higher than conventional fuel.

00:02:47.577 --> 00:02:49.895
The energy of one gram of antimatter would be enough

00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:53.245
for driving a car 1,000 times around the Earth,

00:02:53.245 --> 00:02:56.573
or to bring the space shuttle into orbit.

00:02:56.573 --> 00:03:00.874
So why don't we use antimatter for energy production?

00:03:00.874 --> 00:03:04.109
Well, antimatter isn't just sitting around,

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.260
ready for us to harvest.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.769
We have to make antimatter

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.349
before we can combust antimatter,

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.851
and it takes a billion times more energy

00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:14.374
to make antimatter

00:03:14.374 --> 00:03:16.611
than you get back.

00:03:16.611 --> 00:03:19.792
But, what if there was some antimatter in outer space

00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:21.897
and we could dig it out one day

00:03:21.897 --> 00:03:24.443
from an antiplanet somewhere.

00:03:24.443 --> 00:03:26.901
A few decades ago, many scientists believed

00:03:26.901 --> 00:03:29.159
that this could actually be possible.

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.620
Today, observations have shown

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.038
that there is no significant amount of antimatter

00:03:33.038 --> 00:03:35.375
anywhere in the visible universe,

00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:37.426
which is weird because, like we said before,

00:03:37.426 --> 00:03:39.570
there should be just as much antimatter

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.962
as there is matter in the universe.

00:03:41.962 --> 00:03:44.043
Since antiparticles and particles

00:03:44.043 --> 00:03:47.220
should exist in equal numbers,

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.977
this missing antimatter?

00:03:48.977 --> 00:03:51.589
Now that is a real mystery.

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:53.130
To understand what might be happening,

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.509
we must go back to the Big Bang.

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:57.788
In the instant the universe was created,

00:03:57.788 --> 00:04:01.737
a huge amount of energy was transformed into mass,

00:04:01.737 --> 00:04:03.934
and our initial universe contained

00:04:03.934 --> 00:04:06.563
equal amounts of matter and antimatter.

00:04:06.563 --> 00:04:08.146
But just a second later,

00:04:08.146 --> 00:04:11.022
most matter and all of the antimatter

00:04:11.022 --> 00:04:12.764
had destroyed one another,

00:04:12.764 --> 00:04:15.832
producing an enormous amount of radiation

00:04:15.832 --> 00:04:18.082
that can still be observed today.

00:04:18.082 --> 00:04:20.450
Just about 100 millionths

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.120
of the original amount of matter stuck around

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.786
and no antimatter whatsoever.

00:04:25.786 --> 00:04:27.791
"Now, wait!" you might say,

00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:30.374
"Why did all the antimatter disappear

00:04:30.374 --> 00:04:32.713
and only matter was left?"

00:04:32.713 --> 00:04:35.003
It seems that we were somehow lucky

00:04:35.003 --> 00:04:37.385
that a tiny asymmetry exists

00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:39.261
between matter and antimatter.

00:04:39.261 --> 00:04:41.841
Otherwise, there would be no particles at all

00:04:41.841 --> 00:04:43.349
anywhere in the universe

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.438
and also no human beings.

00:04:45.438 --> 00:04:47.616
But what causes this asymmetry?

00:04:47.616 --> 00:04:50.368
Experiments at CERN are trying to find out the reason

00:04:50.368 --> 00:04:52.519
why something exists

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:54.639
and why we don't live in a universe

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.653
filled with radiation only?

00:04:56.653 --> 00:05:00.290
But, so far, we just don't know the answer.
