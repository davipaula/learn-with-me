00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:12.459
The digital divide is a mother
that is 45 years old and can't get a job

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.976
because she doesn't know
how to use a computer.

00:00:14.986 --> 00:00:18.970
It is an immigrant that doesn't know
that he can call his family for free.

00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:21.809
It is a child who can't solve his homework

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.299
because he doesn't have
access to information.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.109
The digital divide is a new illiteracy.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.789
Digital divide is also defined as a gap
between individuals and communities

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.041
that have access to information
technologies and those that don't.

00:00:34.061 --> 00:00:35.512
Why does this happen?

00:00:35.513 --> 00:00:36.992
It happens because of 3 things.

00:00:36.993 --> 00:00:40.379
The first is that people can't get
access to these technologies

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.919
because they can't afford them.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.572
The second is because
they don't know how to use them,

00:00:44.573 --> 00:00:48.292
and the third is because they don't know
the benefits derived from technology.

00:00:48.293 --> 00:00:50.713
So let's consider
some very basic statistics.

00:00:51.813 --> 00:00:55.339
The population of the world
is nearly 7 billion people.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.999
Out of these, approximately 2 billion
are digitally included.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.716
This is approximately 30%
of the entire world population.

00:01:02.717 --> 00:01:06.677
Which means the remaining
70% of the world,

00:01:07.527 --> 00:01:09.929
close to 5 billion people,

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.956
do not have access
to a computer or the Internet.

00:01:12.957 --> 00:01:15.042
Let's think about
that number for a second.

00:01:15.043 --> 00:01:19.366
5 billion people: that's 4 times
the population of India

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:23.086
that have never touched a computer,
have never accessed the Internet.

00:01:23.087 --> 00:01:25.619
So this is a digital abyss
that we're talking about,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.142
this is not a digital divide.

00:01:27.143 --> 00:01:29.239
Here we can see a map by Chris Harrison

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.802
that shows the internet connections
around the world.

00:01:31.803 --> 00:01:35.109
What we can see is that most
of the internet connections are centered

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.686
on North America and Europe,

00:01:36.687 --> 00:01:41.076
while the rest of the world is engulfed
in the dark shadow of digital divide.

00:01:41.077 --> 00:01:44.426
Next we can see connections,
city-to-city around the world,

00:01:44.427 --> 00:01:46.966
and we can see that most
of the information generated

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:50.601
is being generated
between North America and Europe,

00:01:50.602 --> 00:01:54.306
while the rest of the world is not
broadcasting their ideas or information.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.573
And so, what does this mean?

00:01:56.574 --> 00:02:00.520
We are living in a world that seems
to be having a digital revolution,

00:02:01.827 --> 00:02:05.602
a revolution that everyone here
thinks that we're part of,

00:02:05.603 --> 00:02:09.532
but the 70% of the world that is
digital excluded is not part of this.

00:02:09.532 --> 00:02:11.032
What does this mean?

00:02:11.032 --> 00:02:13.366
Well, the people that will be
digitally excluded

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:16.486
won't be able to compete
in the labor of markets of the future.

00:02:16.487 --> 00:02:19.121
They won't be connected.
They'll be less informed.

00:02:19.134 --> 00:02:22.054
They'll be less inspired,
and they'll be less responsible.

00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:25.109
Internet should not be a luxury,
it should be a right,

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.332
because it is a basic social necessity
of the 21st century.

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:30.066
We can't operate without it.

00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:32.136
(Applause)

00:02:32.137 --> 00:02:33.776
Thank you.

00:02:33.777 --> 00:02:36.166
It allows us to connect to the world.

00:02:36.167 --> 00:02:37.699
It empowers us.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.811
It gives us social participation.
It is a tool for change.

00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:46.899
And so, how are we going
to bridge this digital divide?

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.382
Well, there are many models
that try and bridge the digital divide,

00:02:50.383 --> 00:02:53.686
that try and include
the population at large,

00:02:53.687 --> 00:02:56.347
but the question is,
are they really working?

00:02:56.917 --> 00:02:59.966
I'm sure everybody here
knows One Laptop Per Child,

00:02:59.967 --> 00:03:03.012
where one computer is given to one child.

00:03:03.013 --> 00:03:04.606
The problem with this is,

00:03:04.607 --> 00:03:07.592
do we really want children
to take computers to their homes?

00:03:07.593 --> 00:03:09.666
Homes that have adverse conditions?

00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:12.636
And we also must understand
that by giving a child a computer,

00:03:12.637 --> 00:03:15.386
we're also transferring costs,
very high costs,

00:03:15.387 --> 00:03:18.132
such as internet connection, electricity,

00:03:18.133 --> 00:03:20.899
maintenance, software, updates.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.289
So we must create different models.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.733
Models that help the families
rather than add a burden on them.

00:03:27.943 --> 00:03:31.112
Also, let's not forget
about the carbon footprint.

00:03:31.113 --> 00:03:33.479
Imagine 5 billion laptops.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.312
What would the world look like then?

00:03:35.313 --> 00:03:38.356
Imagine the hazardous residue
that would be generated from that.

00:03:38.357 --> 00:03:39.672
Imagine the trash.

00:03:39.673 --> 00:03:44.066
So, if we give one computer to one person,

00:03:44.067 --> 00:03:48.029
and we multiple that times 5 billion,

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.132
even if that laptop is $100,

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:53.742
then we would have $483 trillion dollars.

00:03:53.743 --> 00:03:57.302
Now let's consider
we're only counting in the youth

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:59.156
- ages 10 to 24 -

00:03:59.157 --> 00:04:02.559
that's approximately 30%
of the digitally excluded population,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.816
then that would be $145 trillion dollars.

00:04:04.817 --> 00:04:07.479
What nation has this amount of money?

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.676
This is not a sustainable model.

00:04:09.677 --> 00:04:12.329
So with this in mind,
we created a different model.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.886
We created the Ria, in Spanish,

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:17.435
or in English, Learning
and Innovation Network.

00:04:17.437 --> 00:04:19.866
Which is a network of community centers

00:04:19.867 --> 00:04:22.306
that bring education
through the use of technology.

00:04:22.307 --> 00:04:24.916
We wanted to increase the number
of users per computer

00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:28.706
in such a way we could dilute the cost
of infrastructure, the cost per user,

00:04:28.707 --> 00:04:31.066
and that we could bring
education and technology

00:04:31.067 --> 00:04:33.373
to everybody within these communities.

00:04:33.374 --> 00:04:36.170
So, let's look at a basic comparison.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.962
the Ria has 1,650 computers.

00:04:39.963 --> 00:04:42.472
If we had used
the One Laptop Per Child model

00:04:42.473 --> 00:04:47.952
of a 1 to 1 ratio, then we would have
benefited 1,650 users.

00:04:47.953 --> 00:04:50.832
What we did instead is we set up centers

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:53.619
that have longer hours
of operation than schools,

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.649
that also include all of the population

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.479
-our youngest user
is 3 years old, the oldest is 86 -

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.299
and with this, in less than 2 years,
we were able to reach

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.109
140,000 users, out of which

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.720
(Applause)

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.536
34,000 has already graduated
from our courses.

00:05:15.537 --> 00:05:17.612
Another thing with One Laptop per Child

00:05:17.613 --> 00:05:20.699
is that it doesn't guarantee
the educational use of a computer.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.142
Technology is nothing
without that content.

00:05:23.143 --> 00:05:26.120
We need to use it
as a means, not as an end.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.349
How did we accomplish such a high impact?

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.532
Well, you can't just go into
a community and pretend to change it,

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:36.379
you need to look at a lot of factors.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.335
So what we do is we do a thing
we call Urban Acupuncture.

00:05:39.336 --> 00:05:43.295
We first start by looking
at the basic geography of a site.

00:05:43.296 --> 00:05:44.959
So take, for example, Ecatepec.

00:05:44.972 --> 00:05:49.715
This is one of the most densely
populated municipalities in Mexico.

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:52.232
It has a very low income level.

00:05:52.233 --> 00:05:55.566
So we look at the basic geography,
we look at roads, streets,

00:05:55.567 --> 00:05:58.966
the flux of pedestrians and vehicles.

00:05:58.967 --> 00:06:01.464
Then we look at income,
we look at education.

00:06:01.465 --> 00:06:04.876
Then we set up a center there

00:06:04.877 --> 00:06:06.969
in the place that's going
to heal the body.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.099
A little needle to change the city body.

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:12.666
And there we go.

00:06:12.667 --> 00:06:15.676
And so, there are four basic elements
that we need to consider

00:06:15.677 --> 00:06:19.499
when we're using education
through technology.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.536
The first one is we need to create spaces.

00:06:22.537 --> 00:06:26.332
We need to create a space
that is welcoming to the community,

00:06:26.333 --> 00:06:31.120
a space that is according to the needs
of the children, and of the elders,

00:06:31.121 --> 00:06:35.419
and of every possible person
that lives within that community.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:39.909
So we create these spaces
that are all made with recycled materials,

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.610
we use modular architecture
to lower the ecological impact.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.066
Second, connection.

00:06:49.067 --> 00:06:50.452
By connection, I mean

00:06:50.453 --> 00:06:53.817
not only a connection
to the Internet, that's too easy.

00:06:53.834 --> 00:06:57.251
We need to create a connection,
an interconnection of humans.

00:06:57.252 --> 00:07:01.049
The Internet is a very complex organism

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:06.282
that is fueled of the ideas, the thoughts,
and the emotions of human beings.

00:07:06.283 --> 00:07:09.297
We need to create networks that aid
in exchanging information.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.512
Third, content.

00:07:12.513 --> 00:07:14.712
Education is nothing without content.

00:07:14.713 --> 00:07:18.153
And you can't pretend to have
a relationship of a computer with a child.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:22.629
So we create a route,

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.199
a very basic learning route,

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.369
where we teach people
how to use a computer,

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.166
how to use the Internet,
how to use office software,

00:07:29.167 --> 00:07:32.498
and in 72 hours,
we create digital citizens.

00:07:32.499 --> 00:07:33.839
You can't just pretend

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.322
that people are going to touch a computer
and become digitally included,

00:07:37.323 --> 00:07:38.796
you need to have a process,

00:07:38.797 --> 00:07:42.049
and after this, they can take on
a longer educational route.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.080
And then fourth, training.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.222
We need to train not only the users
but we need to train

00:07:49.223 --> 00:07:52.130
the people that will facilitate
learning for these people.

00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:54.300
When you're talking about
the digital divide,

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.296
people have stigmas, people have fears,

00:07:56.297 --> 00:07:59.169
people don't understand how
that can complement their lives.

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.692
So what we do is
that we train facilitators

00:08:01.693 --> 00:08:05.277
so that they can help
in breaking that digital barrier.

00:08:06.717 --> 00:08:08.775
So we have four elements.

00:08:08.776 --> 00:08:11.336
We have a space that is created.

00:08:11.337 --> 00:08:12.719
We have a connection.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.932
We have content, and we have training.

00:08:14.933 --> 00:08:17.322
So we have created
a digital learning community.

00:08:17.323 --> 00:08:18.902
But there is one more element

00:08:18.903 --> 00:08:23.799
which is the benefits
that technology can create,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.217
because it is not
printed, static content.

00:08:26.218 --> 00:08:28.519
It is dynamic, it is modifiable.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.912
So we have we do is, we provide
content, then we do training,

00:08:32.913 --> 00:08:36.216
then we analyze the user patterns
so that we can improve content.

00:08:36.217 --> 00:08:37.881
So it creates a virtuous circle.

00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:39.544
It allows us to deliver education

00:08:39.546 --> 00:08:41.866
according to different
types of intelligence,

00:08:41.866 --> 00:08:44.188
and according to different user needs.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:50.186
So with this in mind, we have to think
that technology is something

00:08:50.187 --> 00:08:54.599
that can modify
according to human processes.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.862
I want to share a story.

00:08:55.863 --> 00:08:57.599
In 2006, I went to live here.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.452
This is one of the poorest
communities in all of Mexico.

00:09:01.453 --> 00:09:04.509
I went to film a documentary
on the people that live off trash,

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.079
entirely of trash; their houses
are built with trash.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.162
They eat trash. They dress in trash.

00:09:09.163 --> 00:09:11.032
And after 2 months of living with them,

00:09:11.033 --> 00:09:13.382
of seeing the children,
and the way they work,

00:09:13.383 --> 00:09:15.224
I understood that the only thing

00:09:15.225 --> 00:09:19.589
that can change and that can break
the poverty cycle is education.

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:22.742
And we can use technology
to bring education to these communities.

00:09:24.343 --> 00:09:26.393
Here is another shot.

00:09:26.973 --> 00:09:29.906
And the main message is

00:09:29.907 --> 00:09:33.835
that technology is not going
to save the world, we are.

00:09:33.836 --> 00:09:35.759
And we can use technology to help us.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.389
I'm sure everybody here
has experienced it,

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.769
what moves technology is human energy,

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.926
