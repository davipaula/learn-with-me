00:00:07.017 --> 00:00:09.957
Sitting around a campfire, 
you can feel its heat,

00:00:09.957 --> 00:00:13.167
smell the woody smoke, 
and hear it crackle.

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:14.437
If you get too close,

00:00:14.437 --> 00:00:17.107
it burns your eyes 
and stings your nostrils.

00:00:17.107 --> 00:00:19.678
You could stare at the bright
flames forever

00:00:19.678 --> 00:00:23.728
as they twist and flicker 
in endless incarnations.

00:00:23.728 --> 00:00:25.938
But what exactly are you looking at?

00:00:25.938 --> 00:00:28.558
The flames are obviously not solid,

00:00:28.558 --> 00:00:29.978
nor are they liquid.

00:00:29.978 --> 00:00:33.068
Mingling with the air, they’re 
more like a gas,

00:00:33.068 --> 00:00:35.418
but more visible--and more fleeting.

00:00:35.418 --> 00:00:39.418
And on a scientific level, 
fire differs from gas

00:00:39.418 --> 00:00:43.418
because gases can exist in 
the same state indefinitely

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:47.368
while fires always burn out eventually.

00:00:47.368 --> 00:00:50.638
One misconception is that
fire is a plasma,

00:00:50.638 --> 00:00:53.438
the fourth state of matter in which atoms

00:00:53.438 --> 00:00:55.988
are stripped of their electrons.

00:00:55.988 --> 00:00:58.998
Like fire and unlike the
other kinds of matter,

00:00:58.998 --> 00:01:03.418
plasmas don’t exist in a stable
state on earth.

00:01:03.418 --> 00:01:08.558
They only form when gas is exposed
to an electric field or superheated

00:01:08.558 --> 00:01:13.378
to temperatures of thousands 
or tens of thousands of degrees.

00:01:13.378 --> 00:01:16.588
By contrast, fuels like wood 
and paper burn

00:01:16.588 --> 00:01:19.228
at a few hundred degrees —far below the

00:01:19.228 --> 00:01:24.218
threshold of what's usually
considered a plasma.

00:01:24.218 --> 00:01:27.358
So if fire isn’t a solid, liquid, gas,

00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:30.068
or a plasma, what does that leave?

00:01:30.068 --> 00:01:33.578
It turns out fire isn’t actually
matter at all.

00:01:33.578 --> 00:01:39.658
Instead, it’s our sensory experience of a
chemical reaction called combustion.

00:01:39.658 --> 00:01:43.716
In a way, fire is like the leaves
changing color in fall,

00:01:43.716 --> 00:01:46.446
the smell of fruit as it ripens,

00:01:46.446 --> 00:01:48.886
or a firefly’s blinking light.

00:01:48.886 --> 00:01:51.236
All of these are sensory clues that a

00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:54.316
chemical reaction is taking place.

00:01:54.316 --> 00:01:57.426
What differs about fire is that
it engages a lot of

00:01:57.426 --> 00:02:00.896
our senses at the same time, 
creating the kind of vivid

00:02:00.896 --> 00:02:05.516
experience we expect to come
from a physical thing.

00:02:05.516 --> 00:02:08.226
Combustion creates that sensory experience

00:02:08.226 --> 00:02:11.846
using fuel, heat, and oxygen.

00:02:11.846 --> 00:02:15.699
In a campfire, when the logs are 
heated to their ignition temperature,

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:18.069
the walls of their cells decompose,

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.239
releasing sugars and other 
molecules into the air.

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.019
These molecules then react 
with airborne oxygen

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.789
to create carbon dioxide and water.

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:31.540
At the same time, any trapped
water in the logs

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.600
vaporizes, expands, ruptures 
the wood around it,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.110
and escapes with a satisfying crackle.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.110
As the fire heats up, the carbon 
dioxide and water vapor

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.850
created by combustion expand.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.590
Now that they’re less dense,
they rise in a thinning column.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.850
Gravity causes this expansion and rising, 
which gives

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.440
flames their characteristic taper.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.720
Without gravity, molecules don’t separate

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.210
by density and the flames 
have a totally different shape.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.520
We can see all of this because combustion

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.340
also generates light.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.180
Molecules emit light when heated,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.950
and the color of the light depends

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.860
on the temperature of the molecules.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.230
The hottest flames are white or blue.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.340
The type of molecules in a fire can

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.470
also influence flame color.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.470
For instance, any unreacted 
carbon atoms from the logs

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.360
form little clumps of soot that rise

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.090
into the flames and emit the yellow-orange

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.150
light we associate with a campfire.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.230
Substances like copper, calcium chloride,

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.230
and potassium chloride can add their

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.610
own characteristic hues to the mix.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.610
Besides colorful flames,

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.350
fire also continues to generate heat
as it burns.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.020
This heat sustains the flames by keeping

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.960
the fuel at or above ignition temperature.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.600
Eventually, though, even the hottest fires

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.040
run out of fuel or oxygen.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.410
Then, those twisting flames
give a final hiss

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.860
and disappear with a wisp of smoke

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.210
as if they were never there at all.
