00:00:07.721 --> 00:00:09.881
They’ve caused global scandals.

00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:13.161
They’re banned 
in most athletic competitions.

00:00:13.161 --> 00:00:16.631
But are steroids actually bad for you?

00:00:16.631 --> 00:00:20.929
The term “steroids” refers 
to a broad category of molecules

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:23.389
that share a similar molecular structure,

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:25.899
but have many different functions.

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:29.899
When people talk about steroids 
in the context of sports,

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:34.822
they’re referring to a subset of steroids
that resemble testosterone.

00:00:34.822 --> 00:00:40.752
Though elite athletes and bodybuilders
began using these steroids in the 1950s,

00:00:40.752 --> 00:00:45.275
today, most steroid users 
are actually not competitive athletes,

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:48.565
but people seeking 
a particular appearance.

00:00:48.565 --> 00:00:53.763
These steroids have two main effects: 
androgenic, or masculinizing,

00:00:53.763 --> 00:00:57.293
and anabolic, or growth-promoting.

00:00:57.293 --> 00:01:00.413
These effects mimic naturally-occurring 
testosterone,

00:01:00.413 --> 00:01:02.508
which drives the development 
and maintenance

00:01:02.508 --> 00:01:07.936
of male secondary sex characteristics
and general growth in everyone.

00:01:07.936 --> 00:01:11.936
That means testosterone 
and the synthetic steroids based on it

00:01:11.936 --> 00:01:16.564
promote body and facial hair growth,
enlargement of the vocal cords

00:01:16.564 --> 00:01:20.873
and deepening of the voice, 
increased muscle mass and strength,

00:01:20.873 --> 00:01:24.873
and increased stature and bone mass.

00:01:24.873 --> 00:01:30.063
Recreational steroid users are after
the anabolic, growth promoting effects.

00:01:30.063 --> 00:01:34.665
To make muscles grow, steroids 
first promote protein synthesis—

00:01:34.665 --> 00:01:39.612
proteins are essential building blocks
of all cells, tissues, and organs,

00:01:39.612 --> 00:01:41.102
including muscles.

00:01:41.102 --> 00:01:43.862
Steroids also block cortisol,

00:01:43.862 --> 00:01:47.672
a signaling molecule that drives 
the breakdown of substances

00:01:47.672 --> 00:01:49.232
including proteins.

00:01:49.232 --> 00:01:53.819
Finally, they may push the development
of muscle, rather than fat,

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.819
and boost our metabolism,
shrinking fat deposits.

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:02.773
These properties make steroids valuable
for treating many illnesses and injuries.

00:02:02.773 --> 00:02:05.035
They can help people 
with wasting illnesses,

00:02:05.035 --> 00:02:07.155
like AIDS and certain cancers,

00:02:07.155 --> 00:02:13.443
maintain muscle mass and help burn victims
recover lost muscle tissue.

00:02:13.443 --> 00:02:15.690
So if steroids are used as medicine,

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.820
they must be safe to use recreationally, 
right?

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.510
Well, it’s not that simple.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.680
To create the desired muscle growth,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.477
recreational steroid users must typically
take doses orders of magnitude higher

00:02:28.477 --> 00:02:31.707
than those prescribed
for a medical condition.

00:02:31.707 --> 00:02:36.310
Long term, high dose steroid usage
can have both undesirable

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.580
and outright harmful effects—

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.890
some of them dependent 
on factors like age, sex,

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.290
and underlying health conditions.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.170
We’re not sure 
what all the risk factors are,

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.610
but we do know recreational steroid use
is particularly risky for adolescents.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.460
During puberty, steroid use 
can prompt bones to mature

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.910
before they’re done growing,
causing growth defects.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.430
Adolescents are also most at risk

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.430
for the harmful psychiatric effects 
of steroid use.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.315
The most common of these, increased
impulsivity and increased aggression,

00:03:12.315 --> 00:03:15.275
are well-known as “roid rage.”

00:03:15.275 --> 00:03:19.275
Up to 60% of users 
experience these effects.

00:03:19.275 --> 00:03:20.795
But there are also less common,

00:03:20.795 --> 00:03:26.396
more damaging psychiatric side effects
like mania and even psychosis.

00:03:26.396 --> 00:03:30.696
Steroid use can damage organs 
including the liver and kidneys,

00:03:30.696 --> 00:03:34.902
and cause cardiovascular problems
like high blood pressure.

00:03:34.902 --> 00:03:38.502
While some or all of those effects 
may be reversible,

00:03:38.502 --> 00:03:43.752
steroid use can also cause liver cancer,
especially in males.

00:03:43.752 --> 00:03:47.992
Though recreational users take steroids
for their anabolic effects,

00:03:47.992 --> 00:03:52.892
they also experience androgenic effects—
often undesired.

00:03:52.892 --> 00:03:56.442
That can mean increased body hair,
enlargement of the clitoris,

00:03:56.442 --> 00:03:59.622
and permanent voice deepening in females.

00:03:59.622 --> 00:04:05.646
At the same time, excess testosterone-like
steroids can cause feminization in males,

00:04:05.646 --> 00:04:09.646
because the body converts 
the excess into estrogen.

00:04:09.646 --> 00:04:13.476
This can lead to breast development
and shrinking testicles.

00:04:13.476 --> 00:04:15.556
These effects are not uncommon—

00:04:15.556 --> 00:04:20.427
about a third of male steroid users 
experience them to some degree.

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:25.613
Excess steroid use can also reduce
fertility in males and females—

00:04:25.613 --> 00:04:31.085
by reducing the sperm in semen or 
by causing missed periods and conditions

00:04:31.085 --> 00:04:33.895
like polycystic ovary syndrome.

00:04:33.895 --> 00:04:39.407
All these effects may be reversible 
if steroid use stops— but they may not be.

00:04:39.407 --> 00:04:42.347
The specific steroid, the duration of use,

00:04:42.347 --> 00:04:47.014
and other factors could play 
a role in reversibility.

00:04:47.014 --> 00:04:49.284
Finally, there’s mounting evidence

00:04:49.284 --> 00:04:52.954
that users are susceptible
to steroid dependence.

00:04:52.954 --> 00:04:58.112
They can develop tolerance and require
increasingly large doses over time.

00:04:58.112 --> 00:05:01.572
This increases the risk 
of harmful effects,

00:05:01.572 --> 00:05:05.468
all of which are increasingly common 
at higher doses

00:05:05.468 --> 00:05:08.212
taken for longer durations.

00:05:08.212 --> 00:05:11.212
Still, there remains little definitive 
information

00:05:11.212 --> 00:05:16.193
on how common and how reversible
almost any of the harms are

00:05:16.193 --> 00:05:18.473
at different levels of use.

00:05:18.473 --> 00:05:22.831
We don’t know enough, about 
either risk factors or exposure levels,

00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:28.271
to definitively say any recreational 
steroid use will be harm-free.
