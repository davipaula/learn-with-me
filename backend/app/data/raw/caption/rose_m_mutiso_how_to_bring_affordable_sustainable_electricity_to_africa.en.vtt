00:00:13.737 --> 00:00:17.014
So right now, nearly
one billion people globally

00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:19.967
don't have access
to electricity in their homes.

00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:21.513
And in sub-Saharan Africa,

00:00:21.537 --> 00:00:24.403
more than half of the population
remain in the dark.

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.760
So you probably all know
this image from NASA.

00:00:28.784 --> 00:00:30.414
There's a name for this darkness.

00:00:30.438 --> 00:00:31.938
It's called "energy poverty,"

00:00:31.962 --> 00:00:35.351
and it has massive implications
for economic development

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:36.740
and social well-being.

00:00:36.764 --> 00:00:40.449
One unique aspect of the energy
poverty problem in sub-Saharan Africa --

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:44.339
and by the way, in this talk
when I "energy," I mean "electricity" --

00:00:44.363 --> 00:00:46.323
one thing that's unique about it is

00:00:46.347 --> 00:00:48.929
there isn't much legacy
infrastructure already in place

00:00:48.953 --> 00:00:51.298
in many countries of the region.

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:54.398
So, for example, according to 2015 data,

00:00:54.422 --> 00:00:57.700
the total installed electricity capacity
in sub-Saharan Africa

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:00.020
is only about 100 gigawatts.

00:01:00.044 --> 00:01:01.916
That's similar to that of the UK.

00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:05.375
So this actually presents
a unique opportunity

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.629
to build an energy system
in the 21st century

00:01:08.653 --> 00:01:10.050
almost from scratch.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.886
The question is: How do you do that?

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.361
We could look back to the past
and replicate the ways

00:01:16.385 --> 00:01:19.625
in which we've managed to bring
stable, affordable electricity

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.990
to a big part of the world's population.

00:01:22.518 --> 00:01:25.714
But we all know that that has
some well-known terrible side effects,

00:01:25.738 --> 00:01:27.988
such as pollution and climate change,

00:01:28.012 --> 00:01:30.605
in addition to being
costly and inefficient.

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:34.423
With Africa's population set to quadruple
by the end of the century,

00:01:34.447 --> 00:01:36.718
this is not a theoretical question.

00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:39.355
Africa needs a lot of energy,
and it needs it fast,

00:01:39.379 --> 00:01:42.981
because its population is booming
and its economy needs to develop.

00:01:44.212 --> 00:01:47.929
So for most countries,
the general trajectory of electrification

00:01:47.953 --> 00:01:49.351
has been as follows.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:52.469
First, large-scale
grid infrastructure is put in place,

00:01:52.493 --> 00:01:54.914
usually with significant
public investment.

00:01:54.938 --> 00:01:57.518
That infrastructure then powers
productive centers,

00:01:57.542 --> 00:02:00.524
such as factories,
agricultural mechanization,

00:02:00.548 --> 00:02:03.160
commercial enterprises and the like.

00:02:03.184 --> 00:02:05.709
And this then stimulates economic growth,

00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:08.000
creating jobs, raising incomes

00:02:08.024 --> 00:02:09.518
and producing a virtuous cycle

00:02:09.542 --> 00:02:12.217
that helps more people
afford more appliances,

00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:15.256
which then creates residential
demand for electricity.

00:02:15.946 --> 00:02:19.415
But in sub-Saharan Africa,
despite decades of energy projects,

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.879
we haven't really seen these benefits.

00:02:22.657 --> 00:02:25.462
The energy projects have often
been characterized by waste,

00:02:25.486 --> 00:02:27.584
corruption and inefficiency;

00:02:27.608 --> 00:02:30.412
our rural electrification
rates are really low,

00:02:30.436 --> 00:02:32.784
and our urban rates could be better;

00:02:32.808 --> 00:02:36.040
the reliability of
our electricity is terrible;

00:02:36.064 --> 00:02:39.529
and we have some of the highest
electricity prices in the whole world.

00:02:39.553 --> 00:02:41.233
And on top of all of this,

00:02:41.257 --> 00:02:45.351
we are now facing the impacts of
the growing climate catastrophe head-on.

00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:48.412
So Africa will need
to find a different path.

00:02:49.588 --> 00:02:51.687
And, as it turns out,
we are now witnessing

00:02:51.711 --> 00:02:55.063
some pretty exciting disruption
in the African energy space.

00:02:55.547 --> 00:02:58.019
This new path is called off-grid solar,

00:02:58.043 --> 00:03:00.264
and it's enabled by cheap solar panels,

00:03:00.288 --> 00:03:02.709
advances in LED and battery technology,

00:03:02.733 --> 00:03:05.035
and combined with
innovative business models.

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:09.027
So these off-grid solar products
typically range from a single light

00:03:09.051 --> 00:03:12.133
to home system kits
that can charge phones,

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:14.030
power a television

00:03:14.054 --> 00:03:15.537
or run a fan.

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:16.970
I want to be clear:

00:03:16.994 --> 00:03:19.635
off-grid solar is a big deal in Africa.

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:21.544
I have worked in the sector for years,

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:24.978
and these products are enabling us
to extend basic energy services

00:03:25.002 --> 00:03:26.738
to some of the world's poorest,

00:03:26.762 --> 00:03:28.651
raising their quality of life.

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:31.918
This is a very good
and a very important thing.

00:03:31.942 --> 00:03:36.578
However, off-grid solar will not solve
energy poverty in Africa,

00:03:36.602 --> 00:03:37.797
and for that matter,

00:03:37.821 --> 00:03:40.960
neither will a top-down effort
to connect every unserved household

00:03:40.984 --> 00:03:42.234
to the grid.

00:03:42.258 --> 00:03:46.913
See, I'm not here to rehash
that played-out "on-versus-off-grid"

00:03:46.937 --> 00:03:48.605
or "old-versus-new" debate.

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:49.784
Instead,

00:03:49.808 --> 00:03:53.159
I believe that our inability
to grapple with and truly address

00:03:53.183 --> 00:03:54.393
energy poverty in Africa

00:03:54.417 --> 00:03:56.132
stems from three main sources.

00:03:56.616 --> 00:03:59.566
First, we don't really have
a clear understanding

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.661
of what energy poverty is,
or how deep it goes.

00:04:03.023 --> 00:04:05.883
Second, we are avoiding
complex systemic issues

00:04:05.907 --> 00:04:07.683
and prefer quick fixes.

00:04:07.707 --> 00:04:11.224
And third, we are misdirecting
concerns about climate change.

00:04:11.694 --> 00:04:15.482
Combined, these three mistakes are leading
us to impose a Western debate

00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:16.777
on the future of energy

00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:19.796
and falling back on paternalistic
attitudes towards Africa.

00:04:20.378 --> 00:04:22.638
So let me try and unpack
these three questions.

00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:24.981
First, what exactly is energy poverty?

00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:27.523
The main energy poverty targeted indicator

00:04:27.547 --> 00:04:30.488
is enshrined in the UN's Seventh
Sustainable Development Goal,

00:04:30.512 --> 00:04:31.742
or SDG 7.

00:04:31.766 --> 00:04:34.427
It calls for 100 percent
of the world's population

00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:36.882
to have access to electricity
by the year 2030.

00:04:37.457 --> 00:04:39.122
This binary threshold, however,

00:04:39.146 --> 00:04:43.455
ignores the quality, reliability
or utility of the power,

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.720
though indicators
are currently being developed

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:47.938
that will try and capture these things.

00:04:47.962 --> 00:04:51.187
However, the question of when
a household is considered "connected"

00:04:51.211 --> 00:04:53.008
is not quite clear-cut.

00:04:53.032 --> 00:04:56.763
So, for example, last year
the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi

00:04:56.787 --> 00:04:59.502
declared all of the villages
in India electrified,

00:04:59.526 --> 00:05:01.536
the criteria for electrification being

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.631
a transformer in every village
plus its public centers

00:05:04.655 --> 00:05:08.490
and 10 percent -- 10 percent --
of its households connected.

00:05:09.452 --> 00:05:10.623
Meanwhile,

00:05:10.647 --> 00:05:15.183
the International Energy Agency,
which tracks progress against SDG 7,

00:05:15.207 --> 00:05:20.167
defines energy access as
50 kilowatt hours per person per year.

00:05:20.597 --> 00:05:24.322
That's enough to power
some light bulbs and charge a phone,

00:05:24.346 --> 00:05:28.822
perhaps run a low-watt TV or fan
for a few hours a day.

00:05:28.846 --> 00:05:33.053
Now, providing entry-level access
is an important first step,

00:05:33.077 --> 00:05:35.814
but let's not romanticize the situation.

00:05:35.838 --> 00:05:39.082
By any standard, a few lights
and not much else

00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:41.225
is still living in energy poverty.

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:43.438
And what's more,

00:05:43.462 --> 00:05:46.284
these energy poverty
indicators and targets

00:05:46.308 --> 00:05:48.482
cover only residential use.

00:05:48.506 --> 00:05:51.775
And yet, households account
for just about one quarter

00:05:51.799 --> 00:05:53.686
of the world's electricity consumption.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.769
That's because most of our power
is used in industries and for commerce.

00:05:57.793 --> 00:06:00.040
Which brings me to my main point:

00:06:00.064 --> 00:06:03.907
countries cannot grow out of poverty
without access to abundant,

00:06:03.931 --> 00:06:08.163
affordable and reliable electricity
to power these productive centers,

00:06:08.187 --> 00:06:10.512
or what I call "Energy for Growth."

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:12.156
As you can see from this graph,

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.740
there's simply no such thing
as a low-energy, high-income country.

00:06:15.764 --> 00:06:17.141
It doesn't exist.

00:06:17.165 --> 00:06:19.676
And yet, three billion people in the world

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.375
currently live in countries without
reliable, affordable electricity --

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:26.691
not just to power their homes
but also their factories,

00:06:26.715 --> 00:06:29.057
their office buildings, their data centers

00:06:29.081 --> 00:06:31.037
and other economic activities.

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:34.525
Merely electrifying households
and microenterprises

00:06:34.549 --> 00:06:37.145
cannot solve this deeper energy poverty.

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:38.694
To solve energy poverty,

00:06:38.718 --> 00:06:43.281
we need to deliver reliable,
affordable electricity at scale,

00:06:43.305 --> 00:06:47.255
to power economy-wide job creation
and income growth.

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:51.501
This need, however, bumps
against an emerging narrative that,

00:06:51.525 --> 00:06:52.870
faced with climate change,

00:06:52.894 --> 00:06:56.541
we all need to transition
from large, centralized power systems

00:06:56.565 --> 00:06:58.659
to small-scale distributed power.

00:06:59.722 --> 00:07:01.699
The growth of off-grid solar in Africa --

00:07:01.723 --> 00:07:04.264
and let me repeat,
off-grid solar is a good thing --

00:07:04.288 --> 00:07:07.316
but that growth fits nicely
into this narrative

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.441
and has led to those claims that Africa
is leapfrogging the old ways of energy

00:07:11.465 --> 00:07:14.191
and building its power system
from the ground up,

00:07:14.215 --> 00:07:15.973
one solar panel at a time.

00:07:16.942 --> 00:07:20.879
It's a nice, solicitous narrative,
but also quite naïve.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.630
Like many narratives
of technological disruption,

00:07:24.654 --> 00:07:26.652
often inspired by Silicon Valley,

00:07:26.676 --> 00:07:31.561
it takes for granted the existing systems
that underpin all of this transformation.

00:07:32.067 --> 00:07:35.385
You see, when it comes
to innovating and energy,

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:39.800
the West is working around the edges
of a system that is tried and tested.

00:07:39.824 --> 00:07:41.791
And so all the sexy stuff --

00:07:41.815 --> 00:07:43.307
the rooftop solar,

00:07:43.331 --> 00:07:46.792
the smart household devices,
the electric vehicles --

00:07:46.816 --> 00:07:50.941
all of this is built on top of a massive
and absolutely essential grid,

00:07:50.965 --> 00:07:54.346
which itself exists within
a proven governance framework.

00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:57.813
Even the most advanced
countries in the world

00:07:57.837 --> 00:08:02.076
don't have an example of an energy system
that is all edges and no center at scale.

00:08:03.163 --> 00:08:05.801
So ultimately, no approach --

00:08:05.825 --> 00:08:09.587
be it centralized or distributed,
renewable or fossil-based --

00:08:09.611 --> 00:08:12.202
can succeed in solving energy poverty

00:08:12.226 --> 00:08:16.380
without finding a way to deliver
reliable, affordable electricity

00:08:16.404 --> 00:08:19.784
to Africa's emerging industrial
and commercial sectors.

00:08:20.312 --> 00:08:23.382
So, it's not just lights
in every rural home.

00:08:23.908 --> 00:08:27.254
It's power for Africa's cities
that are growing fast

00:08:27.278 --> 00:08:29.908
and increasingly full
of young, capable people

00:08:29.932 --> 00:08:31.664
in desperate need of a job.

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:36.059
This in turn will require
significant interconnectivity

00:08:36.083 --> 00:08:37.606
and economies of scale,

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.571
making a robust and modern grid

00:08:39.595 --> 00:08:42.455
a crucial piece of any
energy poverty solution.

00:08:43.821 --> 00:08:48.042
So, our second mistake is falling
for the allure of the quick fix.

00:08:48.417 --> 00:08:50.300
You see, energy poverty exists

00:08:50.324 --> 00:08:53.671
within a complex socioeconomic
and political context.

00:08:54.121 --> 00:08:57.197
And part of the appeal
of new electrification models

00:08:57.221 --> 00:08:58.993
such as off-grid solar, for example,

00:08:59.017 --> 00:09:03.601
is they can often bypass the glacial pace
and inefficiency of government.

00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:08.121
See, with small systems you can skip
the bureaucracies and the utilities

00:09:08.145 --> 00:09:10.057
and sell directly to customers.

00:09:10.914 --> 00:09:13.682
But to confront energy poverty,

00:09:13.706 --> 00:09:16.880
you cannot ignore governments,
you cannot ignore institutions,

00:09:16.904 --> 00:09:20.612
you cannot ignore the many players
involved in making, moving

00:09:20.636 --> 00:09:23.227
and using electricity at scale,

00:09:23.251 --> 00:09:26.890
which is a way to say that when it comes
to providing energy for growth,

00:09:26.914 --> 00:09:29.492
it's not just about
innovating the technology,

00:09:29.516 --> 00:09:34.047
it's about the slow and hard work
of improving governance, institutions

00:09:34.071 --> 00:09:35.991
and the broader macroenvironment.

00:09:37.022 --> 00:09:40.307
OK, so this is all good and nice, you say.

00:09:40.743 --> 00:09:42.378
But what about climate change?

00:09:42.968 --> 00:09:46.372
How do we ensure a high-energy
future for everyone

00:09:46.396 --> 00:09:48.359
while also curbing our emissions?

00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:52.559
Well, we'll have to make
some complex tradeoffs,

00:09:52.583 --> 00:09:54.957
but I believe that
a high-energy future for Africa

00:09:54.981 --> 00:09:57.697
is not mutually exclusive
to a low-carbon future.

00:09:58.239 --> 00:09:59.647
And make no mistake:

00:09:59.671 --> 00:10:02.611
the world cannot expect Africa
to remain in energy poverty

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:04.149
because of climate change.

00:10:04.173 --> 00:10:07.942
(Applause)

00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:15.245
Actually, the facts show
that the opposite is true.

00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:18.463
Energy will be essential for Africa
to adapt to climate change

00:10:18.487 --> 00:10:19.968
and build resilience.

00:10:19.992 --> 00:10:23.996
You see, rising temperatures will mean
increased demand for space cooling

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.193
and cold storage.

00:10:25.217 --> 00:10:28.893
Declining water tables will mean
increased pumped irrigation.

00:10:28.917 --> 00:10:32.779
And extreme weather and rising sea levels
will require a significant expansion

00:10:32.803 --> 00:10:35.034
and reinforcement of our infrastructure.

00:10:35.058 --> 00:10:37.718
These are all energy-intensive activities.

00:10:38.535 --> 00:10:42.041
So balancing climate change
and Africa's pressing need

00:10:42.065 --> 00:10:44.106
to transition to a high-energy future

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:45.361
will be tough.

00:10:45.385 --> 00:10:49.246
But doing so is nonnegotiable;
we will have to find a way.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.365
The first step is broadening
the terms of the debate

00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:55.078
away from this either-or framing.

00:10:55.102 --> 00:10:57.685
And we also must stop
romanticizing solutions

00:10:57.709 --> 00:10:59.985
that distract us from the core challenges.

00:11:01.572 --> 00:11:05.920
And let's not also forget that Africa
is endowed with vast natural resources,

00:11:05.944 --> 00:11:08.558
including significant renewable potential.

00:11:08.979 --> 00:11:11.720
For example, in Kenya, where I'm from,

00:11:11.744 --> 00:11:15.508
geothermal power accounts
for half of our electricity generation,

00:11:15.532 --> 00:11:17.601
and with hydro being
the other major source,

00:11:17.625 --> 00:11:20.076
we are already mainly powered
by renewable energy.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.384
We also just brought online
Africa's largest wind farm

00:11:23.408 --> 00:11:26.322
and East Africa's biggest solar facility.

00:11:26.346 --> 00:11:29.985
(Applause)

00:11:30.906 --> 00:11:32.295
In addition,

00:11:32.319 --> 00:11:36.108
new technology means that we can now
run and design our power systems

00:11:36.132 --> 00:11:38.590
and use energy more efficiently than ever,

00:11:38.614 --> 00:11:40.298
doing more with less.

00:11:40.322 --> 00:11:42.479
Energy efficiency
will be an important tool

00:11:42.503 --> 00:11:44.627
in the fight against climate change.

00:11:45.998 --> 00:11:51.271
So in closing, I'd just like to say that
Africa is a real place with real people,

00:11:51.295 --> 00:11:54.502
navigating complex challenges
and major transitions,

00:11:54.526 --> 00:11:56.822
just like any other region of the world.

00:11:56.846 --> 00:11:59.998
(Applause)

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:05.055
And while each country and each region

00:12:05.079 --> 00:12:07.987
has its social, economic
and political quirks,

00:12:08.011 --> 00:12:10.577
the physics of electricity
are the same everywhere.

00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:14.354
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:12:14.378 --> 00:12:17.400
And the energy needs of our economies

00:12:17.424 --> 00:12:20.804
are just as intensive as those
of any other economy.

00:12:21.535 --> 00:12:24.360
So, the expansion
of household electrification

00:12:24.384 --> 00:12:26.542
through a mix of
on- and off-grid solutions

00:12:26.566 --> 00:12:28.908
has had an incredible impact in Africa.

00:12:28.932 --> 00:12:32.211
But they are nowhere near sufficient
for solving energy poverty.

00:12:32.628 --> 00:12:34.326
To solve energy poverty,

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:38.480
we need generation of electricity
from diverse sources at scale

00:12:38.504 --> 00:12:40.971
and modern grids to power
a high-energy future,

00:12:40.995 --> 00:12:43.747
in which Africans can enjoy
modern living standards

00:12:43.771 --> 00:12:45.262
and well-paying jobs.

00:12:45.744 --> 00:12:47.532
Africans deserve this,

00:12:47.556 --> 00:12:51.643
and with one of every four people
in the world projected to be African

00:12:51.667 --> 00:12:53.313
by the year 2100,

00:12:53.337 --> 00:12:54.588
the planet needs it.

00:12:54.612 --> 00:12:55.778
Thank you.

00:12:55.802 --> 00:12:58.771
(Applause)
