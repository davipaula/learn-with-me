00:00:12.792 --> 00:00:16.351
When you imagine the architectural
wonders of the world,

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:17.684
what do you see?

00:00:17.708 --> 00:00:19.726
The greatness of the Pyramids of Giza

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.643
or maybe the amazing
aqueducts of Ancient Rome?

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:27.976
Both of these are amazing
feats of human innovation.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.559
As an architect,

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:33.434
I've often wondered why do we
monumentalize the ancient wonders

00:00:33.458 --> 00:00:37.601
of civilizations that collapsed
such a long time ago?

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:41.559
I've traveled the world
studying ancient innovation,

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:46.143
and what I've found are Indigenous
technologies from living cultures

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:48.143
that are still in use.

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:51.934
And some of these cultures
you may have never heard of.

00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:55.059
They live in the most
remote places on earth,

00:00:55.083 --> 00:01:00.351
facing environmental extremes
like desert drought and frequent flooding

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:02.518
for generations.

00:01:02.542 --> 00:01:05.184
A couple of years ago,
I traveled to northern India

00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:08.059
to a place overlooking
the plains of Bangladesh

00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:10.226
where the Khasi people live

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.268
in a forest that receives more rainfall
than anywhere else on earth.

00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:16.809
And during the monsoon season,

00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:20.268
travel between villages
is cut off by these floods,

00:01:20.292 --> 00:01:22.643
which transform this entire landscape

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:27.101
from a forested canopy
into isolated islands.

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:30.143
This hill tribe has evolved
living root bridges

00:01:30.167 --> 00:01:32.809
that are created
by guiding and growing tree roots

00:01:32.833 --> 00:01:36.268
that you can barely wrap your arms around

00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:38.643
through a carefully woven scaffolding.

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:43.059
Multiple generations of the Khasi men
and the women and the children,

00:01:43.083 --> 00:01:44.684
they'll take care of these roots

00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:46.976
as they grow to the other
side of that bank,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.309
where they're then planted
to make a structure

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:51.851
that will get stronger with age.

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:56.893
This 1,500-year-old tradition
of growing living root bridges

00:01:56.917 --> 00:02:00.934
has produced 75
of these incredible structures.

00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:04.226
And while they take 50 years to grow,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.375
in this landscape
they actually last for centuries.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.518
All across the globe,

00:02:09.542 --> 00:02:14.559
I've seen cultures who have been
living with floods for thousands of years

00:02:14.583 --> 00:02:19.434
by evolving these ancient technologies
that allow them to work with the water.

00:02:19.458 --> 00:02:21.643
In the southern wetlands of Iraq,

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:26.101
which are formed by the confluence
of the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers,

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:29.559
a unique, water-based civilization lives.

00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:32.976
For 6,000 years,
the Maʿdān have floated villages

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.018
on man-made islands that are constructed
from a single species of reed

00:02:38.042 --> 00:02:39.643
that grows around them.

00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:44.268
And the Qasab reed
is integral to every aspect of life.

00:02:44.292 --> 00:02:47.018
It is food for water buffalo,

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:48.809
flour for humans

00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:53.518
and building material
for these biodegradable, buoyant islands

00:02:53.542 --> 00:02:55.476
and their cathedral-like houses

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.875
that they construct
in as little as three days.

00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:01.518
And this dried Qasab reed,

00:03:01.542 --> 00:03:03.643
it can be bundled into columns,

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:08.101
it can be woven into floors
or roofs or walls,

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:11.184
and it can also be twisted into a rope

00:03:11.208 --> 00:03:15.976
that's used to bind these buildings
without the use of any nails.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.601
The Maʿdān villages
are constructed in the marsh,

00:03:19.625 --> 00:03:22.393
as they have been for generations,

00:03:22.417 --> 00:03:28.351
on islands that stay afloat
for over 25 years.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:32.309
Although global attention
is focused on the pandemic,

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:35.958
cities are still sinking
and sea levels are still rising.

00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:38.184
And high-tech solutions

00:03:38.208 --> 00:03:41.066
are definitely going to help us
solve some of these problems,

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.184
but in our rush towards the future,

00:03:44.208 --> 00:03:46.434
we tend to forget about the past.

00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:50.226
In other parts of the world,
where rivers are contaminated with sewage,

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.643
a city of 15 million people cleans
its waste water with its flood plains.

00:03:56.667 --> 00:03:58.851
On the edges of Calcutta,

00:03:58.875 --> 00:04:02.643
flanked by a smoking
escarpment of the city's trash

00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:05.518
and ribboned by its highways,

00:04:05.542 --> 00:04:09.018
an Indigenous technology of 300 fish ponds

00:04:09.042 --> 00:04:12.726
cleans its water while producing its food.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.643
And through a combination
of sunshine and sewage

00:04:16.667 --> 00:04:20.518
and a symbiosis
between algae and bacteria,

00:04:20.542 --> 00:04:22.893
the wastewater is broken down.

00:04:22.917 --> 00:04:25.684
Fish ponds continue
this cleaning of the water

00:04:25.708 --> 00:04:28.417
in a process that takes around 30 days.

00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:30.643
And this innovation,

00:04:30.667 --> 00:04:36.333
it's not just a model for chemical
and coal-power-free purification.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.226
Since Calcutta's core
has no formal treatment,

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.434
it's the city's only way
of cleaning the water downstream

00:04:43.458 --> 00:04:46.559
before it enters the Bay of Bengal.

00:04:46.583 --> 00:04:50.768
What I find so unbelievable
about this infrastructure

00:04:50.792 --> 00:04:54.934
is that as cities across the world
in Asia and in Europe

00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:58.018
begin to replicate this exact system,

00:04:58.042 --> 00:05:03.101
Calcutta is now struggling to save it
from being displaced by development.

00:05:03.125 --> 00:05:06.726
And then to deal with flooding
in a completely other way,

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.833
the Tofinu tribe has developed
the largest lake city in Africa.

00:05:11.875 --> 00:05:15.184
Ganvié, meaning "We survived,"

00:05:15.208 --> 00:05:18.893
is built of stilted houses that are
organized around a canal system

00:05:18.917 --> 00:05:21.601
that you can navigate by dugout canoe.

00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:26.268
And the royal square stands
amongst 3,000 stilted buildings

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:28.518
that include a post office,

00:05:28.542 --> 00:05:30.559
a bank, a mosque

00:05:30.583 --> 00:05:31.893
and even a couple of bars

00:05:31.917 --> 00:05:36.893
that are all surrounded
by 12,000 individual fish paddocks,

00:05:36.917 --> 00:05:39.018
or mangrove acadjas.

00:05:39.042 --> 00:05:44.601
This chemical-free artificial reef
covers almost half of the lagoon

00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:48.476
and feeds one million people
that are living around it.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.851
What amazes me

00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:54.934
is that while an individual acadja
is pretty insignificant,

00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:57.976
when it's multiplied by 12,000,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.101
it creates an Indigenous technology
the scale of industrial aquaculture,

00:06:03.125 --> 00:06:07.309
which is the greatest threat
to our mangrove ecosystems ...

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:08.809
but this technology --

00:06:08.833 --> 00:06:12.059
it builds more biodiversity than before.

00:06:12.083 --> 00:06:14.893
Just earlier this year,
when I was back home in Australia,

00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:17.184
the craziest thing happened.

00:06:17.208 --> 00:06:21.518
The burned ash from the bushfires
surrounding Sydney rained down on us

00:06:21.542 --> 00:06:22.934
on Bondi Beach.

00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.934
And worried about carbon emissions --

00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.393
not viral transmissions --

00:06:26.417 --> 00:06:29.393
we were already wearing masks.

00:06:29.417 --> 00:06:31.893
The air was so choked by a plume of smoke

00:06:31.917 --> 00:06:36.476
that was so big that it reached
as far away as New Zealand.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.684
Then in the midst of these wildfires,

00:06:38.708 --> 00:06:42.143
which were the worst
we'd ever seen on record,

00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:44.018
something unexpected happened,

00:06:44.042 --> 00:06:46.268
but incredibly amazing.

00:06:46.292 --> 00:06:47.976
The ancestral lands in Australia,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.726
where Indigenous fire-stick
farming was practiced,

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.059
were saved as these fires
raged around them.

00:06:54.083 --> 00:06:55.434
And these ancient forests --

00:06:55.458 --> 00:06:59.059
they survived because of seasonal,
generational burning,

00:06:59.083 --> 00:07:04.726
which is an Aboriginal practice
of lighting small, slow and cool fires.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.143
So though wildfires
are a natural disaster,

00:07:08.167 --> 00:07:10.601
as a consequence of climate change,

00:07:10.625 --> 00:07:12.851
they're also man-made.

00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:17.143
And what's so amazing about this
is we have the ancient technology

00:07:17.167 --> 00:07:19.018
that we know can help prevent them,

00:07:19.042 --> 00:07:22.268
and we've used it for thousands of years.

00:07:22.292 --> 00:07:25.976
And what I find so fascinating
about these technologies

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.726
is how complex they are

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.643
and how attuned they are to nature.

00:07:29.667 --> 00:07:32.643
And then, how resilient
we could all become

00:07:32.667 --> 00:07:34.226
by learning from them.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:39.684
Too often when we are faced with a crisis,
we build walls in defense.

00:07:39.708 --> 00:07:41.018
I'm an architect,

00:07:41.042 --> 00:07:44.434
and I've been trained
to seek solutions in permanence --

00:07:44.458 --> 00:07:47.351
concrete, steel, glass --

00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:51.351
these are all used to build
a fortress against nature.

00:07:51.375 --> 00:07:55.184
But my search for ancient systems
and Indigenous technologies

00:07:55.208 --> 00:07:56.601
has been different.

00:07:56.625 --> 00:08:02.601
It's been inspired by an idea
that we can seed creativity in crisis.

00:08:02.625 --> 00:08:06.101
We have thousands of years
of ancient knowledge

00:08:06.125 --> 00:08:08.184
that we just need to listen to

00:08:08.208 --> 00:08:13.393
and allow it to expand our thinking
about designing symbiotically with nature.

00:08:13.417 --> 00:08:15.018
And by listening,

00:08:15.042 --> 00:08:16.934
we'll only become wiser

00:08:16.958 --> 00:08:20.184
and ready for those
21st-century challenges

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:25.018
that we know will endanger
our people and our planet.

00:08:25.042 --> 00:08:26.601
And I've seen it.

00:08:26.625 --> 00:08:27.958
I know that it's possible.
