00:00:12.832 --> 00:00:14.449
I love infographics.

00:00:14.473 --> 00:00:16.187
As an information designer,

00:00:16.211 --> 00:00:19.413
I've worked with all sorts of data
over the past 25 years.

00:00:19.437 --> 00:00:22.838
I have a few insights to share,
but first: a little history.

00:00:24.793 --> 00:00:29.781
Communication is the encoding,
transmission and decoding of information.

00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:33.543
Breakthroughs in communication mark
turning points in human culture.

00:00:35.384 --> 00:00:40.192
Oracy, literacy and numeracy
were great developments in communication.

00:00:40.216 --> 00:00:42.897
They allow us to encode ideas into words

00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:44.634
and quantities into numbers.

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:48.240
Without communication, we'd still
be stuck in the Stone Ages.

00:00:49.706 --> 00:00:52.612
Although humans have been around
for a quarter million years,

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:55.684
it was only 8,000 years ago
that proto-writings began to surface.

00:00:56.703 --> 00:01:00.619
Nearly 3,000 years later, the first
proper writing systems took shape.

00:01:03.608 --> 00:01:08.201
Maps have been around for millennia
and diagrams for hundreds of years,

00:01:08.225 --> 00:01:11.059
but representing quantities
through graphics

00:01:11.083 --> 00:01:12.843
is a relatively new development.

00:01:13.208 --> 00:01:18.066
It wasn't until 1786 that William Playfair
invented the first bar chart,

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.784
giving birth to visual display
of quantitative information.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.781
Fifteen years later, he introduced
the first pie and area charts.

00:01:27.225 --> 00:01:30.778
His inventions are still the most
commonly used chart forms today.

00:01:32.698 --> 00:01:36.896
Florence Nightingale invented
the coxcomb in 1857

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.828
for a presentation to Queen Victoria
on troop mortality.

00:01:40.193 --> 00:01:41.365
Highlighted in blue,

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:44.886
she showed how most troops' deaths
could have been prevented.

00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:52.114
Shortly after, Charles Minard charted
Napoleon's march on Moscow,

00:01:52.138 --> 00:01:57.385
illustrating how an army of 422,000
dwindled to just 10,000

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.861
as battles, geography and freezing
temperatures took their toll.

00:02:01.885 --> 00:02:05.013
He combined a Sankey diagram
with cartography

00:02:05.037 --> 00:02:06.785
and a line chart for temperature.

00:02:09.084 --> 00:02:11.838
I get excited when I get
lots of data to play with,

00:02:11.862 --> 00:02:14.704
especially when it yields
an interesting chart form.

00:02:17.364 --> 00:02:21.001
Here, Nightingale's coxcomb
was the inspiration

00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:24.264
to organize data on thousands
of federal energy subsidies,

00:02:24.288 --> 00:02:28.196
scrutinizing the lack of investment
in renewables over fossil fuels.

00:02:30.543 --> 00:02:34.755
This Sankey diagram illustrates
the flow of energy through the US economy,

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:39.096
emphasizing how nearly half
of the energy used is lost as waste heat.

00:02:42.598 --> 00:02:45.774
I love it when data can be sculpted
into beautiful shapes.

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:50.230
Here, the personal and professional
connections of the women of Silicon Valley

00:02:50.254 --> 00:02:52.146
can be woven into arcs,

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.314
same as the collaboration of inventors
birthing patents across the globe

00:02:58.338 --> 00:02:59.681
can be mapped.

00:03:01.385 --> 00:03:03.189
I've even made charts for me.

00:03:03.213 --> 00:03:05.726
I'm a numbers person,
so I rarely win at Scrabble.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.476
I made this diagram to remember
all the two- and three-letter words

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.276
in the official Scrabble dictionary.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.381
(Laughter)

00:03:12.405 --> 00:03:15.259
Knowing these 1,168 words
certainly is a game changer.

00:03:15.283 --> 00:03:16.297
(Laughter)

00:03:16.851 --> 00:03:20.440
Sometimes I produce code
to quickly generate graphics

00:03:20.464 --> 00:03:22.256
from thousands of data points.

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.754
Coding also enables me
to produce interactive graphics.

00:03:26.778 --> 00:03:30.080
Now we can navigate information
on our own terms.

00:03:32.064 --> 00:03:34.310
Exotic chart forms certainly look cool,

00:03:34.334 --> 00:03:37.211
but something as simple
as a little dot may be all you need

00:03:37.235 --> 00:03:39.332
to solve a particular thinking task.

00:03:41.713 --> 00:03:45.783
In 2006, the "New York Times"
redesigned their "Markets" section,

00:03:45.807 --> 00:03:48.254
cutting it down from eight pages
of stock listings

00:03:48.278 --> 00:03:51.175
to just one and a half pages
of essential market data.

00:03:52.313 --> 00:03:55.302
We listed performance metrics
for the most common stocks,

00:03:55.326 --> 00:03:59.082
but I wanted to help investors
see how the stocks are doing.

00:03:59.106 --> 00:04:01.826
So I added a simple little dot

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.932
to show the current price
relative to its one-year range.

00:04:06.505 --> 00:04:10.412
At a glance, value investors can pick out
stocks trading near their lows

00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:12.304
by looking for dots to the left.

00:04:12.951 --> 00:04:16.418
Momentum investors can find stocks
on an upward trajectory

00:04:16.442 --> 00:04:17.901
via dots to the right.

00:04:18.354 --> 00:04:21.179
Shortly after, the "Wall Street Journal"
copied the design.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.339
Simplicity is often the goal
for most graphics,

00:04:24.363 --> 00:04:27.102
but sometimes we need
to embrace complexity

00:04:27.126 --> 00:04:30.279
and show large data sets
in their full glory.

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:36.049
Alec Gallup, the former chairman
of the Gallup Organization,

00:04:36.073 --> 00:04:38.060
once handed me a very thick book.

00:04:38.084 --> 00:04:39.386
It was his family's legacy:

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.770
hundreds of pages covering six decades
of presidential approval data.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.094
I told him the entire book
could be graphed on a single page.

00:04:47.118 --> 00:04:48.498
"Impossible," he said.

00:04:50.992 --> 00:04:52.156
And here it is:

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.992
25,000 data points on a single page.

00:04:55.016 --> 00:04:58.782
At a glance, one sees that most presidents
start with a high approval rating,

00:04:58.806 --> 00:05:00.219
but few keep it.

00:05:00.243 --> 00:05:02.498
Events like wars initially boost approval;

00:05:02.522 --> 00:05:04.380
scandals trigger declines.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.594
These major events were annotated
in the graphic but not in the book.

00:05:09.315 --> 00:05:12.977
The point is, graphics can transmit data
with incredible efficiency.

00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:17.422
Graphicacy --

00:05:17.446 --> 00:05:19.831
the ability to read and write graphics --

00:05:19.855 --> 00:05:21.452
is still in its infancy.

00:05:21.476 --> 00:05:25.521
New chart forms will emerge
and specialized dialects will evolve.

00:05:25.876 --> 00:05:27.570
Graphics that help us think faster

00:05:27.594 --> 00:05:30.909
or see a book's worth
of information on a single page

00:05:30.933 --> 00:05:34.388
are the key to unlocking new discoveries.

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:38.812
Our visual cortex was built
to decode complex information

00:05:38.836 --> 00:05:41.416
and is a master at pattern recognition.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.876
Graphicacy enables us
to harness our built-in GPU

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.560
to process mountains of data

00:05:46.584 --> 00:05:48.662
and find the veins of gold hiding within.

00:05:49.204 --> 00:05:50.354
Thank you.

00:05:50.378 --> 00:05:53.151
(Applause and cheers)
