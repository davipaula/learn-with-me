00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.600
Well, I have known
many alpha males in my life,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.080
chimpanzee alpha males,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.416
and I'm going to talk
about what an alpha male is,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.456
because I think we can all learn
a lot from our close relatives

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.576
where we have alpha males.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.056
And as an example, I want to give you
Amos, a male that I knew

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.296
who was a young male
and he was alpha male,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.736
he was very popular,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.856
but he got sick

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.056
and he lost his position because,
you know, chimpanzee males

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.936
they can spot from a mile away
if you are weak

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.336
and they went for him,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.336
and he lost his position,
and then he got sicker and sicker

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.256
until at some point we had to isolate him.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.016
The group lived on a grassy island,

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.376
and we had to isolate him in a cage,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.216
but we cracked open the cage
so that the rest of the chimps

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.736
still had access to him.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.896
And what happened was most touching.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.696
Other chimps would bring food to him,

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.656
they would bring wood wool to him,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.216
which is this thing that they use
to sleep in and build nests out of,

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.096
and females would put
the wood wool behind his back.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.056
He was leaning heavily against the wall,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.456
and the way we do with pillows
to patients in a hospital,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.616
they were putting
that stuff behind his back.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.016
And I thought, this is the way
to go for an alpha male.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.016
He was loved and respected,
and everyone was taking care of him,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.736
and this is not always how it goes,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.456
because some males don't end so well
when they lose their position.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.656
So Amos was an example
of a male who was liked as a leader,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.096
and I think the term alpha male,
if you look it up on the internet,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.776
you will find all these business books
that tell you how to be an alpha male,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.176
and what they mean
is how to beat up others

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.176
and beat them over the head
and let them know that you are boss

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.936
and don't mess with me and so on.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.760
And basically an alpha male
for them is a bully.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.496
And I really don't like
that kind of description,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.736
because I am actually partly responsible
for the term "alpha male"

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.016
because I wrote this book
"Chimpanzee Politics,"

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.496
which was recommended by Newt Gingrich
to freshmen congressmen.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.256
I don't know what good it did,
but he recommended that book to them,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.160
and after that the term
"alpha male" became very popular.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.736
But I think it is used
in a mischaracterization.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.096
It's used in a very superficial way

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.696
that doesn't relate
to what a real alpha male is.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.176
And so I'm here to explain what that is.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.856
The term itself goes back
actually much further.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.576
It goes back to the '40s and '50s,
research on wolves,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.696
and basically the definition
is very simple.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.736
The highest ranking male
is the alpha male.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.016
The highest ranking female
is the alpha female.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.896
Every primate group
has one alpha male, one alpha female,

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.976
not more than that, there's only one.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.200
And I will explain how that goes.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.456
So first, the body language.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.536
What you see here is two male chimpanzees
who are the same size,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.976
but one is walking upright,
has his hair up,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.576
has a big rock in his hand,
and he's the alpha male.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.056
The other male is pant-grunting to him,

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.136
is being submissive to him
and bowing for him,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.536
and that is the sort of ritual they need
to go through many times a day

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.440
in order to have a stable relationship.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.256
I'll show you a video from the field.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.816
What you will see here
is a female pant-grunting to an alpha male

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.320
and you will see how that goes.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.536
The male is approaching,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.896
she grunts at him.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.416
(Chimpanzee grunts)

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.656
He has all his hair up

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.000
and he displays.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.616
I'm actually standing far too close.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.656
A chimpanzee is far stronger than I am,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.496
and I just was not very prudent,
this particular video.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.656
So what you saw him do

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.656
is he was lifting himself up
and standing on two legs,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.936
and putting his arms out.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.616
That's called the bipedal swagger.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.376
It's a very common posture
in high-ranking males,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.456
and it's very recognizable
because humans do this kind of stuff.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.696
(Laughter)

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.080
Humans do this all the time.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.616
And what I really like
about this particular picture

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.760
is the two old guys to the side.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.216
This is very chimpanzee.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.616
In chimpanzees,

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.816
we have usually old males
who are over the hill,

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.856
who cannot be alpha male
themselves anymore,

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.696
but they start playing games
and forming coalitions,

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.616
and behind the backs of others.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.495
And they become extremely influential,

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:31.616
and you may actually have old males

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.976
who are more influential
than the alpha male himself.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.616
Just as an example,

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.056
the three males
that I used to work with most

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.536
at the Dutch zoo long ago, where I worked,

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.896
and the middle male here
is a 17-year-old alpha male.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.256
The male whom he is grooming
on the side is twice as old,

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.056
and this old male has made him the leader.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.416
So you can imagine that that old male
has an enormous amount of power,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.776
because he has made
the alpha male alpha male.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.456
The male on the right

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.936
is individually the strongest male.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.696
In captivity, you can test it out,

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.296
and you can know that this male
has no trouble with either one.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.056
He has only trouble
with the combination of the two.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.256
And so the coalition formation
that goes on in chimpanzee society

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.336
makes it much more complex than you think.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.176
It means, for example,

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.176
that the smallest male in a group
can be the alpha male.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.656
You don't need to be
the biggest and strongest male.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.376
The smallest male, if he has
the right friends and keeps them happy,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.896
or he has female support,

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.256
he can be the alpha male.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.736
So the coalition system
makes everything complex,

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.136
and I'm always waiting here in the US

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.256
for the primaries,
the end of the primaries,

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.056
because that's a moment
where you need to demonstrate unity.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.656
Now let me first show you
how the unity is shown in chimpanzees.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.936
What you see here is two males on the left

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.216
who are standing together.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.616
You also see the big
canine teeth that they have.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.216
And they're standing together and they
demonstrate to the rest of the group,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.816
"We are together. We are a unit."

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.776
The males on the right
are walking together in synchrony.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.616
That's another way of demonstrating
that you are together.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.856
And so demonstrating unity
is extremely important

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.496
in a coalition system,

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.656
and as I said, in the primaries
always I'm waiting for that moment

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.656
because then you have
two members of the same party

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.576
who have been fighting with each other,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.016
and they need to come
together at some moment.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.976
And it leads to very awkward situations.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.816
People who don't like each other
need to embrace each other

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.096
and stand together,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.616
and that's absolutely essential
for the unity of the party,

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.176
and if you don't do that,
the party may fall apart.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.096
And so if it doesn't go well,
like in this particular case --

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.416
(Laughter)

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.216
then the party is in deep doo-doo

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.800
because they have not demonstrated unity.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.376
So that's a very important part
of the coalition system,

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.760
and that's something that we share
between humans and chimpanzees.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.136
Now, how do you become an alpha male?

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.856
First of all, you need to be
impressive and intimidating

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.816
and demonstrate your vigor on occasion

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.460
and show that you are very strong,

00:07:02.484 --> 00:07:04.976
and there's all sorts
of ways of doing that.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.056
But other things that you need to do
is you need to be generous.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.656
So, for example,
males who go on a campaign

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.936
to dethrone the leader,

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.456
which may take two or three months

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.136
where they're testing
all the coalitions in the group,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.096
they also become extremely generous.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.200
They share food very easily with everyone.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.816
Or they start to tickle
the babies of the females.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.376
They're normally, male chimpanzees,
not particularly interested in infants,

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.576
but when they are campaigning like that,

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.296
they get very interested in infants
and they tickle them,

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.616
and they try to curry favor
with the females.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:36.656
(Laughter)

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.936
So in humans, of course,

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.976
I am always intrigued
by these men who are candidates

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.416
and hold babies up like this.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.016
This is not particularly
something that babies like --

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.056
(Laughter)

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.656
but since it is a signal
to the rest of the world,

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.696
they need to hold them in the air.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.096
And I was really intrigued by,

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.936
when we had a female candidate
in the last election,

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.296
the way she held babies
was more like this,

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.416
which is what babies really like.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.776
But she of course
didn't need to send the message

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.016
that she could hold a baby
without dropping it,

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.016
which was what the man was doing.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.896
So this is a very common tactic,

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.896
and male chimpanzees,

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.616
they spend a lot of time
currying favor with all sorts of parties

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.040
when they are campaigning.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.256
Now, what are the privileges and the costs

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.960
of being an alpha male?

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.336
The biggest privilege is females.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.896
Food is really irrelevant.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.696
Male chimpanzees
can go a week without food

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:33.976
if there's a female in estrus
and they're sexually interested in her.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.256
Food is secondary to sex.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.056
And so the male chimpanzees --

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.096
and we evolutionary biologists, of course,
we have an explanation for this,

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.816
is that sex leads to reproduction,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:47.376
and reproductive success
is the measure of evolution.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.135
That's how everything evolves.

00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:51.936
And so if males can enhance
their reproductive success

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.376
by being high ranking,

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.336
you get automatically the ambition
to be high ranking in the males.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.040
So that's the privilege.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.856
The costs, one cost is of course

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.936
that you need to keep your partners happy.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.816
So if you come to power
with the support of an old male,

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.856
you need to let that old male
mate with females.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:15.920
If you don't do that,
that old male is going to get mad at you,

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.976
and you're going to lose him as a partner.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.096
So there's a transaction going on.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.056
If you become alpha male this way,
you need to keep your partners happy.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.576
And so that's one of the costs.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.016
The second cost is that
everyone wants your position.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.896
Alpha male position
is a very important position,

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.096
and everyone wants to take it from you,

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.296
and so you constantly
have to watch your back.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.976
You have to be extremely vigilant.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.696
For example, you have to
disrupt the coalitions of others

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.976
and that's what male
chimpanzees do quite a bit.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.096
Divide and rule strategies, they have.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:49.456
And so that's a very stressful situation,
and we actually have data on this.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.376
The data comes from the field,

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.016
from baboons not chimpanzees in this case,

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.536
where they did fecal samples
on the baboons

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.256
and they analyzed them
for glucocorticoids.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.576
And what you see here is a graph

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.536
where you see that the lower ranking
the male baboon is,

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.696
the higher is his cortisol level

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.976
in the feces,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.336
but the alpha male, as you see,

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.496
has just as high a level
as the lowest-ranking males,

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.016
and so you may think that being alpha male
is nice and dandy and is wonderful,

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.616
but it's actually
a very stressful position,

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.760
and we can demonstrate
that physiologically.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.816
Now, what are the obligations?

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.336
And here, for me,
it gets really interesting,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.600
and it deviates very much
from your typical image of the alpha male.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.120
The alpha male
has two sorts of obligations.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.736
One is to keep the peace in the group.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.216
We call that the control role,

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.976
to control fights in the group,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.376
and the second is to be the most empathic,

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.320
the consoler in chief, basically,
of the nation, so to speak.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.736
So first of all, keeping the peace.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.696
This is a male who stops a fight
between two females.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.536
Two females on the left and the right

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.180
have been screaming and yelling
at each other over food,

00:10:59.204 --> 00:11:01.696
because food is very
important for the females,

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.416
and so he stops the fight between them
and stands between them like this.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.631
And it's very interesting to me
that alpha males, when they do this,

00:11:08.655 --> 00:11:09.895
they become impartial.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.056
They don't support their mom
or their best buddy.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.696
No, no, they stop fights,

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.856
and they come up
for the underdog in general.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.056
And this makes them
extremely popular in the group,

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.056
because they provide security

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.576
for the lowest-ranking
members of the group.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.416
And so they become impartial,

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.096
which is an unusual condition
for a chimpanzee to be in,

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.096
because they're usually
very fond of their friends and so on,

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.176
and these alpha males
who are good at this,

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.096
they can be very effective
at keeping the peace in the group.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.376
And the second thing they do
is they show empathy for others.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.136
Now, I do an enormous amount
of research on empathy,

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.896
and I don't have time to go into it,

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.976
but empathy is nowadays a topic
that we study in rodents and dogs

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.096
and elephants and primates,

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.360
all sorts of animals.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.816
And what you see here is two bonobos.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.016
The one in front

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.496
has been beaten up in a fight.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.816
The one in the back puts
her arms around her and consoles her.

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.496
This is also actually how we measure
empathy in young children,

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.016
by looking at how they respond
to distressed individuals.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.336
And high-ranking males,
they do a lot of this.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.776
High-ranking males provide an enormous
amount of comfort in the group,

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.216
and they go to places
where there are earthquakes

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.296
or hurricanes

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.936
and they provide comfort.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.096
The pope does this.
The presidents do this.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.456
All the leaders in the world
have to do this job.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.296
The queen does it and so on.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.736
They all have to do this job,

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.136
so providing consolation,
and that's a very important task.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.176
And males who are good at these two,

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.616
keeping the peace and providing comfort,

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.656
they become extremely popular leaders,

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.496
and there's actually
some self-interest involved in it.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.336
They don't do it just for the group,

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.560
because it also stabilizes their position.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.216
The more popular
a male becomes as alpha male

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.936
and the more the rest of them
respects them and looks up to them,

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.776
the better their position is defended

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.296
in case it's going to be
challenged by somebody else,

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.616
because then, of course, the whole group
is going to support that male

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.296
because they want to keep
a leader who is good for them.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.686
So the group is usually very supportive
of males who are good leaders,

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.976
and it's not supportive at all of bullies.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.816
And when bullies lose their position,

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.040
they may end up
in a very bad situation there.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.376
This is data actually
on the consolation behavior.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.336
This is data on consolation
in chimpanzees,

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.496
and you see for the medium-
and low-ranking individuals,

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.576
the females do more of it than the males.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.656
This is basically the whole community.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.576
And this is true for all
the mammal studies on empathy

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.936
is that females
have more of it than males.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.576
But look at the alpha male.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.056
The alpha male does
far more than anybody else.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.160
And so that's the data on alpha males
being the consoler in chief, basically.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.360
The last thing I want to say
is something about alpha females.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.536
This is a picture of Mama,
the alpha female in the Arnhem zoo

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.776
where I used to work,

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.416
who is now all over the internet,

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.656
I think a hundred million
clicks at the moment,

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.176
for a video of her dying at the age of 59,

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.776
which happened last year.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.656
And Mama was an absolute
centrum of the group.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.096
So she was not physically capable
of dominating the males.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:14.016
She ranked below the males,
but she was the center of the community,

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.216
and if there was big trouble
in the community,

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.536
everyone would end up in the arms of Mama.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.776
And so she was a very important figure.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.976
And so I don't want to minimize
the position of alpha females

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.376
in the chimpanzee group.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.776
And then we have a species
that is equally close to us

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.256
as the chimpanzee, the bonobo.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.976
We often forget about the bonobo,
but the bonobos have a matriarchal society

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.536
and the alpha individual
is a female, generally.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.416
Generally, it's a female
who is at the top of the community,

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.536
and we know much less
about how this is done

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.416
and how they get to that position,
and what they do with it,

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.296
because we know much less
about bonobos in general.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.656
But I do want to emphasize

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.136
that the alpha in a group
doesn't need to be a male,

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.240
and that actually in one
of our close relatives, it is a female.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.616
So the message I want to leave you with

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.920
is that if you are looking
at men in our society

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.176
who are the boss of, let's say,

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.896
a family or a business
or Washington or whatever,

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.296
you call them alpha male,

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.656
you should not insult chimpanzees

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.416
by using the wrong label.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.656
(Laughter)

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.160
You should not call a bully an alpha male.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.576
Someone who is big and strong
and intimidates and insults everyone

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.216
is not necessarily an alpha male.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.296
An alpha male has all sorts of qualities,

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.296
and I have seen bully
alpha males in chimpanzees,

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.576
they do occur,

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.336
but most of the ones that we have

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.296
have leadership capacities

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.336
and are integrated in their community,

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.136
and, like Amos at the end,

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.936
they are loved and respected,

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.696
and so it's a very different situation
than you may think.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.976
And I thank you.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.720
(Applause)
