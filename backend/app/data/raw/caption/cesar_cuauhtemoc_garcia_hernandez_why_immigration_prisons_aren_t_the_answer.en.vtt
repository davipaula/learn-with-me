00:00:10.917 --> 00:00:13.198
Outside of Philadelphia,

00:00:13.838 --> 00:00:19.152
there's an old nursing home
that peaks out from behind lush trees.

00:00:20.048 --> 00:00:26.302
Instead of caring for the old,
these days, it detains the young:

00:00:26.977 --> 00:00:31.202
kids who came to the United States
with their parents.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.763
Inside its hallways,

00:00:33.763 --> 00:00:37.873
a little boy named Diego
went from diapers to detention.

00:00:38.513 --> 00:00:40.320
When he was just one year old,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.830
Diego's mother, Wendy, decided 
that life in Honduras was too dangerous

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.075
for them to stay.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.940
Like people from all over the world 
have done for generations,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.312
Diego and Wendy turned 
to the United States for safety.

00:00:54.892 --> 00:01:00.662
If you are in the United States 
and you are afraid for your life,

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.719
federal law is clear 
that you can ask for asylum.

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:12.204
It does not matter where you came from 
or how you got here.

00:01:12.904 --> 00:01:15.395
Diego and Wendy did just that.

00:01:15.695 --> 00:01:16.792
Within a few days,

00:01:16.792 --> 00:01:20.302
they found themselves inside
that Pennsylvania immigration prison.

00:01:20.802 --> 00:01:27.690
Two among half a million people 
who will be locked up every single year

00:01:28.002 --> 00:01:29.525
while the government decides

00:01:29.525 --> 00:01:33.206
if they will be allowed to stay
in the United States.

00:01:34.087 --> 00:01:39.618
Instead of a fair match between
a prosecutor and a defense attorney,

00:01:40.222 --> 00:01:44.403
imprisoned migrants 
usually walk into court alone.

00:01:45.093 --> 00:01:46.685
It's a high-stakes legal battle

00:01:46.685 --> 00:01:50.833
that they are forced to fight 
with their hands tied behind their backs.

00:01:52.155 --> 00:01:55.883
As the courts deliberate, the days pass.

00:01:56.354 --> 00:01:58.280
From your community to mine,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.238
today someone is locked up
who has not been accused of any crime.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.774
Often, they haven't seen a judge
or even a lawyer.

00:02:08.226 --> 00:02:10.958
And yet in most immigration prisons

00:02:10.958 --> 00:02:15.288
that I have visited
as a lawyer or a researcher,

00:02:15.748 --> 00:02:20.807
the steel doors close shut
with the clank of confinement.

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.046
For the sake of votes, politicians claim

00:02:24.046 --> 00:02:28.443
people like Diego and Wendy 
are dangerous or dishonest.

00:02:28.913 --> 00:02:31.109
For the sake of profits,

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:35.478
private corporations 
run prisons to house them.

00:02:36.997 --> 00:02:42.858
It seems unimaginable today,
but we haven't always locked up migrants

00:02:42.858 --> 00:02:46.638
who are waiting for the government
to decide their fate.

00:02:47.377 --> 00:02:48.964
At one time,

00:02:48.964 --> 00:02:54.294
the United States stood on the verge 
of abolishing immigration prisons.

00:02:54.984 --> 00:02:58.868
"This was the sign 
of an enlightened civilization,"

00:02:58.938 --> 00:03:02.600
the Supreme Court wrote in 1958.

00:03:03.541 --> 00:03:04.967
We were so close,

00:03:05.534 --> 00:03:11.280
but politics and profits 
pushed us in the opposite direction.

00:03:11.755 --> 00:03:15.706
With the support 
of Republicans and Democrats,

00:03:15.727 --> 00:03:21.650
today we lock up men, we lock up women,
and we lock up children.

00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:27.009
But in our past, 
I see hope for the future.

00:03:28.015 --> 00:03:33.750
We can take clear steps
toward abolishing immigration prisons.

00:03:34.675 --> 00:03:38.346
Most think of Ellis Island as the place

00:03:38.346 --> 00:03:42.487
that welcomed generations 
of newcomers to the United States.

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.100
It did that.

00:03:44.372 --> 00:03:47.958
But it was also an immigration prison

00:03:48.055 --> 00:03:51.157
with an ironic view 
of the Statue of Liberty.

00:03:52.286 --> 00:03:54.157
By the 1950s,

00:03:54.157 --> 00:03:59.064
the Ellis Island facility needed 
to be repaired, replaced or discarded.

00:03:59.593 --> 00:04:03.773
The government of the war hero
turned Republican president,

00:04:03.773 --> 00:04:05.401
Dwight Eisenhower,

00:04:05.683 --> 00:04:07.460
decided to shut it down.

00:04:08.658 --> 00:04:12.662
But then, starting in the late 1970s,

00:04:13.108 --> 00:04:19.184
the United States built the largest 
immigration prison system in the world.

00:04:19.783 --> 00:04:24.126
Republicans and Democrats worked together,

00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:27.421
pointing to the prisons' barbed wire

00:04:27.421 --> 00:04:32.732
to uphold the law and protect you from me.

00:04:33.744 --> 00:04:37.814
When Haitians started arriving 
in large numbers in the 1970s,

00:04:38.101 --> 00:04:40.343
Carter turned to detention.

00:04:40.635 --> 00:04:47.386
In the 1980s, Reagan followed by jailing
Cubans and Central Americans.

00:04:48.597 --> 00:04:53.797
George H.W. Bush turned to
the military base at Guantanamo, Cuba,

00:04:53.807 --> 00:04:55.537
to jail migrants.

00:04:55.937 --> 00:04:58.932
President Clinton left them there.

00:04:59.371 --> 00:05:05.325
The next President Bush 
separated parents from their children.

00:05:05.718 --> 00:05:07.348
Congress balked at this,

00:05:07.348 --> 00:05:08.997
so Bush relented

00:05:09.097 --> 00:05:14.802
by building a detention site
where families could be confined together.

00:05:15.841 --> 00:05:19.169
President Obama shut this down.

00:05:19.535 --> 00:05:26.040
But just a few years later, 
Obama opened up two similar sites.

00:05:27.241 --> 00:05:30.090
President Trump wants more.

00:05:31.065 --> 00:05:33.462
This isn't a partisan issue.

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:36.420
This is a profits issue.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.088
To local governments
and private businesses,

00:05:40.088 --> 00:05:42.685
immigration prisons 
are a financial spigot.

00:05:42.859 --> 00:05:47.150
The two largest private
prison corporations in the United States,

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.640
CoreCivic and the GEO Group,

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.613
get about half of their money 
from the federal government.

00:05:52.678 --> 00:05:56.561
With that, they hire people 
in out-of-the-way locations

00:05:56.561 --> 00:05:59.420
where decent-paying jobs 
are hard to come by.

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:03.773
Down in South Texas,
head north from the border,

00:06:03.773 --> 00:06:09.028
and eventually, you will catch 
the sharp stench of onions

00:06:09.028 --> 00:06:10.448
filling the air.

00:06:10.798 --> 00:06:13.613
The local economy of Raymondville,

00:06:13.643 --> 00:06:16.183
that's the county seat of Willacy County,

00:06:16.183 --> 00:06:17.949
it runs on produce,

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:21.199
on produce and on prisons.

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:23.408
Tucked behind a state jail,

00:06:23.408 --> 00:06:29.062
the Willacy County Detention Center
houses federal immigration prisoners

00:06:29.062 --> 00:06:30.944
in large canvas tents.

00:06:31.747 --> 00:06:36.298
A few years ago, this facility shut down 
after inmates rebelled.

00:06:36.787 --> 00:06:39.516
And when that happened, 
I was not surprised

00:06:39.516 --> 00:06:42.529
because back when I used to 
represent clients there,

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:46.825
stories of rape, harassment 
and abuse were common.

00:06:47.655 --> 00:06:51.115
Eventually, the county
lost a few hundred jobs.

00:06:51.435 --> 00:06:53.967
Even the Walmart shut down.

00:06:54.807 --> 00:06:59.020
But then, in the summer of 2018,

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.143
when the refurbished prison 
was ramping up to re-open,

00:07:03.445 --> 00:07:06.644
the county's elected officials celebrated.

00:07:07.051 --> 00:07:09.063
Why was the county so interested?

00:07:09.347 --> 00:07:12.835
It owned the prison, 
and the private company just ran it.

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.684
Having prisoners on the inside

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:17.664
meant that the private company
could hire guards

00:07:17.664 --> 00:07:19.262
and they could hire nurses,

00:07:19.262 --> 00:07:22.522
and it meant that the county
could pay its bills.

00:07:24.147 --> 00:07:28.688
With support from Washington 
down to Willacy County,

00:07:29.591 --> 00:07:33.014
it's a good time to be in the business 
of locking up migrants.

00:07:34.745 --> 00:07:40.411
But we can't forget that these are people 
who we're talking about:

00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:45.667
from kids who are too young 
to be asked their opinions

00:07:46.825 --> 00:07:51.001
to adults with longtime ties
to the United States.

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:54.688
Diego and Wendy were stuck

00:07:54.688 --> 00:07:58.248
inside that old nursing home
turned prison,

00:07:58.548 --> 00:08:03.890
waiting for the legal process 
to slowly grind forward.

00:08:04.533 --> 00:08:09.819
Just one when he arrived, 
Diego was three by the time he got out.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:15.874
Eventually, he won his legal case 
to stay in the United States,

00:08:16.691 --> 00:08:22.202
but not before 650 nights passed.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.417
And yet, others are not so lucky.

00:08:27.952 --> 00:08:34.560
Kamyar Samimi had a green card
and 40 years in the United States

00:08:34.811 --> 00:08:40.184
when one day ICE showed up at his door 
and took him down to a private prison

00:08:40.184 --> 00:08:41.850
in suburban Denver.

00:08:42.791 --> 00:08:46.643
Within 13 days, he was dead.

00:08:47.702 --> 00:08:51.276
The government never got around 
to deciding if he should be deported.

00:08:52.479 --> 00:08:55.031
In this topsy-turvy world,

00:08:55.719 --> 00:09:00.690
we feel better when we lock up
kids with their mothers

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:05.010
or when people don't meet 
the same end as Mr. Samimi?

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.066
Is this really the best that we can do?

00:09:10.829 --> 00:09:15.189
To move the path to a world

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.790
that's free of immigration prisons

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.403
does not begin by pretending 
that migrants are perfect.

00:09:25.701 --> 00:09:28.081
It starts with a reality check.

00:09:28.673 --> 00:09:33.026
Immigration law tells us 
that migrants are aliens,

00:09:34.335 --> 00:09:37.957
but we all know migrants are not aliens.

00:09:39.113 --> 00:09:41.172
Migrants are just people

00:09:41.532 --> 00:09:45.022
and like most people, most of the time,

00:09:45.022 --> 00:09:48.358
migrants are profoundly ordinary -

00:09:48.864 --> 00:09:53.475
ordinary people 
asked to do the extraordinary,

00:09:53.475 --> 00:09:57.320
wage your final fight 
to stay in this country

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:01.630
while you are locked up
far away from family or friends

00:10:02.065 --> 00:10:04.875
where lawyers are hard to come by.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:11.823
To fix this and move toward a world
without immigration prisons,

00:10:12.406 --> 00:10:16.272
let's stop paying
CoreCivic and the Geo Group

00:10:16.272 --> 00:10:18.014
to lock up migrants.

00:10:18.521 --> 00:10:22.566
And let's start paying lawyers
to defend them.

00:10:23.223 --> 00:10:25.834
(Applause)

00:10:31.632 --> 00:10:34.460
Having a lawyer just means

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:39.858
that the courts are more likely
to reach a fair and a just conclusion.

00:10:39.983 --> 00:10:43.650
And when it comes
to important legal questions,

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.292
let's be honest,

00:10:45.482 --> 00:10:48.713
What's more American 
than a fight between lawyers?

00:10:48.713 --> 00:10:50.477
(Laughter)

00:10:50.477 --> 00:10:52.266
We've done this in the past.

00:10:52.317 --> 00:10:55.773
The government 
has run several pilot projects.

00:10:55.843 --> 00:11:00.400
Every time, support has proven enough 
to get migrants out of prison,

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.435
to keep them on top of their court dates

00:11:03.435 --> 00:11:05.751
and away from trouble.

00:11:06.938 --> 00:11:09.466
But we've never let these projects grow.

00:11:11.085 --> 00:11:12.660
Politics and profits

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:17.285
have always stamped out
the promise of freedom.

00:11:18.256 --> 00:11:24.023
We can lock up migrants,
but we don't have to.

00:11:24.442 --> 00:11:28.803
Instead of hoping
that barbed wire and steel doors

00:11:28.803 --> 00:11:32.829
will guide us out of the labyrinth 
of immigration law,

00:11:33.341 --> 00:11:37.014
we could invest in justice.

00:11:37.478 --> 00:11:38.957
We could make sure

00:11:38.957 --> 00:11:45.238
that every migrant has a fair chance
of putting their best legal case forward.

00:11:46.161 --> 00:11:51.844
Because immigration prisons 
don't get us out of a problem.

00:11:52.498 --> 00:11:55.489
Immigration prisons are the problem.

00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:58.483
(Applause)

00:12:03.266 --> 00:12:09.031
They blind us to the past 
when we did things differently,

00:12:09.277 --> 00:12:11.196
and they distract us

00:12:11.196 --> 00:12:17.766
from the money-making tentacles 
that tie our future to the prison gates.

00:12:18.166 --> 00:12:23.390
But the thing is, liberty is too precious

00:12:23.917 --> 00:12:27.027
for any of us to lose it

00:12:27.027 --> 00:12:33.711
because politicians want votes 
and private corporations want money.

00:12:34.394 --> 00:12:35.558
Thank you.

00:12:35.858 --> 00:12:38.158
(Applause)
