00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:15.253
Before I get started:

00:00:15.277 --> 00:00:16.665
I'm really excited to be here

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.927
to just actually watch
what's going to happen, from here.

00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:25.400
So with that said,
we're going to start with:

00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:28.466
What is one of our greatest needs,

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.799
one of our greatest needs for our brain?

00:00:30.823 --> 00:00:33.051
And instead of telling you,
I want to show you.

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:34.556
In fact, I want you to feel it.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.219
There's a lot I want you to feel
in the next 14 minutes.

00:00:37.243 --> 00:00:39.475
So, if we could all stand up.

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:43.919
We're all going to conduct
a piece of Strauss together.

00:00:44.546 --> 00:00:46.480
Alright? And you all know it.

00:00:46.815 --> 00:00:48.377
Alright. Are you ready?

00:00:48.401 --> 00:00:49.562
Audience: Yeah!

00:00:49.586 --> 00:00:51.888
Beau Lotto: Alright.
Ready, one, two, three!

00:00:52.506 --> 00:00:53.704
It's just the end.

00:00:53.728 --> 00:00:57.697
(Music: Richard Strauss
"Also Sprach Zarathustra")

00:01:01.036 --> 00:01:02.211
Right?

00:01:02.235 --> 00:01:03.729
You know where it's going.

00:01:03.753 --> 00:01:08.871
(Music)

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.100
Oh, it's coming!

00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:23.980
(Music stops abruptly)

00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:25.155
Oh!

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:26.345
(Laughter)

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.536
Right?

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.012
Collective coitus interruptus.

00:01:29.036 --> 00:01:30.433
OK, you can all sit down.

00:01:30.457 --> 00:01:32.357
(Laughter)

00:01:32.381 --> 00:01:35.540
We have a fundamental need for closure.

00:01:35.564 --> 00:01:37.508
(Laughter)

00:01:37.532 --> 00:01:39.341
We love closure.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.903
(Applause)

00:01:41.927 --> 00:01:45.177
I was told the story that Mozart,
just before he'd go to bed,

00:01:45.201 --> 00:01:46.587
he'd go to the piano and go,

00:01:46.611 --> 00:01:47.765
"da-da-da-da-da."

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.472
His father, who was already in bed,
would think, "Argh."

00:01:50.496 --> 00:01:53.188
He'd have to get up
and hit the final note to the chord

00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:54.816
before he could go back to sleep.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.934
(Laughter)

00:01:55.958 --> 00:02:01.059
So the need for closure
leads us to thinking about:

00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:03.260
What is our greatest fear?

00:02:04.378 --> 00:02:08.642
Think -- what is our greatest fear
growing up, even now?

00:02:09.407 --> 00:02:13.064
And it's the fear of the dark.

00:02:15.717 --> 00:02:17.866
We hate uncertainty.

00:02:18.384 --> 00:02:20.344
We hate to not know.

00:02:20.368 --> 00:02:21.534
We hate it.

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:22.997
Think about horror films.

00:02:23.021 --> 00:02:25.791
Horror films are always shot in the dark,

00:02:25.815 --> 00:02:27.791
in the forest,

00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:29.053
at night,

00:02:29.077 --> 00:02:30.348
in the depths of the sea,

00:02:30.372 --> 00:02:31.982
the blackness of space.

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:35.870
And the reason is because
dying was easy during evolution.

00:02:35.894 --> 00:02:37.815
If you weren't sure that was a predator,

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:38.989
it was too late.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.033
Your brain evolved to predict.

00:02:42.057 --> 00:02:44.458
And if you couldn't predict, you died.

00:02:45.136 --> 00:02:49.352
And the way your brain predicts
is by encoding the bias and assumptions

00:02:49.376 --> 00:02:51.165
that were useful in the past.

00:02:51.593 --> 00:02:54.379
But those assumptions
just don't stay inside your brain.

00:02:54.403 --> 00:02:56.803
You project them out into the world.

00:02:57.498 --> 00:02:59.368
There is no bird there.

00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:03.139
You're projecting the meaning
onto the screen.

00:03:04.506 --> 00:03:08.063
Everything I'm saying to you right now
is literally meaningless.

00:03:09.151 --> 00:03:11.580
(Laughter)

00:03:11.604 --> 00:03:14.675
You're creating the meaning
and projecting it onto me.

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:17.286
And what's true for objects
is true for other people.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.744
While you can measure
their "what" and their "when,"

00:03:19.768 --> 00:03:21.625
you can never measure their "why."

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:22.847
So we color other people.

00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:27.513
We project a meaning onto them
based on our biases and our experience.

00:03:29.911 --> 00:03:34.201
Which is why the best of design is almost
always about decreasing uncertainty.

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.822
So when we step into uncertainty,

00:03:37.858 --> 00:03:40.762
our bodies respond
physiologically and mentally.

00:03:40.786 --> 00:03:43.635
Your immune system
will start deteriorating.

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.509
Your brain cells wither and even die.

00:03:46.533 --> 00:03:50.086
Your creativity and intelligence decrease.

00:03:50.443 --> 00:03:54.332
We often go from fear to anger,
almost too often.

00:03:54.356 --> 00:03:57.250
Why? Because fear is a state of certainty.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.751
You become morally judgmental.

00:03:59.775 --> 00:04:01.878
You become an extreme version of yourself.

00:04:01.902 --> 00:04:04.505
If you're a conservative,
you become more conservative.

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:06.672
If you're a liberal,
you become more liberal.

00:04:06.696 --> 00:04:09.075
Because you go to a place of familiarity.

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:13.294
The problem is that the world changes.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.458
And we have to adapt or die.

00:04:15.482 --> 00:04:17.260
And if you want to shift from A to B,

00:04:17.284 --> 00:04:19.180
the first step is not B.

00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:22.267
The first step is to go from A to not A --

00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:25.332
to let go of your bias and assumptions;

00:04:25.356 --> 00:04:29.881
to step into the very place
that our brain evolved to avoid;

00:04:31.696 --> 00:04:34.877
to step into the place of the unknown.

00:04:37.553 --> 00:04:40.180
But it's so essential
that we go to this place

00:04:40.204 --> 00:04:42.942
that our brain gave us a solution.

00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:45.109
Evolution gave us a solution.

00:04:45.133 --> 00:04:49.598
And it's possibly one of the most profound
perceptual experiences.

00:04:50.971 --> 00:04:53.579
And it's the experience of awe.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.149
(Music)

00:05:56.333 --> 00:06:00.022
(Applause)

00:06:01.109 --> 00:06:06.982
(Music)

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.854
(Applause)

00:06:12.878 --> 00:06:18.267
(Music)

00:06:56.557 --> 00:07:01.339
(Applause)

00:07:02.438 --> 00:07:07.007
(Music)

00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:21.896
(Applause)

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.769
(Cheers)

00:07:25.793 --> 00:07:30.420
(Applause)

00:07:31.836 --> 00:07:34.876
Beau Lotto: Ah, how wonderful, right?

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:41.786
So right now, you're probably all feeling,
at some level or another, awe.

00:07:42.332 --> 00:07:43.483
Right?

00:07:43.507 --> 00:07:46.773
So what's happening
inside your brain right now?

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:48.997
And for thousands of years,

00:07:49.021 --> 00:07:52.410
we've been thinking and writing
and experiencing awe,

00:07:52.434 --> 00:07:55.007
and we know so little about it.

00:07:55.514 --> 00:08:01.619
And so to try to understand
what is it and what does it do,

00:08:01.643 --> 00:08:07.476
my Lab of Misfits had just
the wonderful opportunity and the pleasure

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:12.514
to work with who are some of the greatest
creators of awe that we know:

00:08:12.538 --> 00:08:16.408
the writers, the creators,
the directors, the accountants,

00:08:16.432 --> 00:08:18.793
the people who are Cirque Du Soleil.

00:08:20.137 --> 00:08:21.987
And so we went to Las Vegas,

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.616
and we recorded
the brain activity of people

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.974
while they're watching the performance,

00:08:28.998 --> 00:08:31.784
over 10 performances of "O,"

00:08:31.808 --> 00:08:34.641
which is iconic Cirque performance.

00:08:34.665 --> 00:08:38.229
And we also measured
the behavior before the performance,

00:08:38.253 --> 00:08:41.010
as well as a different group
after the performance.

00:08:41.332 --> 00:08:43.932
And so we had over 200 people involved.

00:08:45.371 --> 00:08:47.323
So what is awe?

00:08:47.347 --> 00:08:49.506
What is happening
inside your brain right now?

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.538
It's a brain state. OK?

00:08:52.562 --> 00:08:55.260
The front part of your brain,
the prefrontal cortex,

00:08:55.284 --> 00:08:57.601
which is responsible
for your executive function,

00:08:57.625 --> 00:08:58.875
your attentional control,

00:08:58.899 --> 00:09:00.699
is now being downregulated.

00:09:02.157 --> 00:09:06.777
The part of your brain called
the DMN, default mode network,

00:09:06.801 --> 00:09:09.776
which is the interaction
between multiple areas in your brain,

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.514
which is active during, sort of, ideation,

00:09:13.538 --> 00:09:16.760
creative thinking in terms
of divergent thinking and daydreaming,

00:09:16.784 --> 00:09:18.450
is now being upregulated.

00:09:19.942 --> 00:09:21.934
And right about now,

00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.714
the activity in your
prefrontal cortex is changing.

00:09:25.416 --> 00:09:28.344
It's becoming asymmetrical
in its activity,

00:09:28.368 --> 00:09:29.678
biased towards the right,

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:33.543
which is highly correlated
when people step forward into the world,

00:09:33.567 --> 00:09:35.167
as opposed to step back.

00:09:36.718 --> 00:09:41.702
In fact, the activity across the brains
of all these people was so correlated

00:09:41.726 --> 00:09:44.258
that we're able to train
an artificial neural network

00:09:44.282 --> 00:09:46.991
to predict whether or not
people are experiencing awe

00:09:47.015 --> 00:09:50.220
to an accuracy of 75 percent on average,

00:09:50.244 --> 00:09:52.177
with a maximum of 83 percent.

00:09:54.946 --> 00:09:58.306
So what does this brain state do?

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:00.579
Well, others have demonstrated,

00:10:00.603 --> 00:10:03.176
for instance, Professors
Haidt and Keltner,

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.948
have told us that people feel small
but connected to the world.

00:10:08.662 --> 00:10:12.169
And their prosocial behavior increases,

00:10:12.193 --> 00:10:15.043
because they feel an increased
affinity towards others.

00:10:15.836 --> 00:10:18.233
And we've also shown in this study

00:10:18.257 --> 00:10:21.630
that people have less need
for cognitive control.

00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:25.923
They're more comfortable with uncertainty
without having closure.

00:10:26.408 --> 00:10:29.473
And their appetite
for risk also increases.

00:10:29.497 --> 00:10:33.259
They actually seek risk,
and they are better able at taking it.

00:10:34.172 --> 00:10:36.751
And something that
was really quite profound

00:10:36.775 --> 00:10:38.299
is that when we asked people,

00:10:38.323 --> 00:10:42.116
"Are you someone who has a propensity
to experience awe?"

00:10:42.641 --> 00:10:45.188
They were more likely
to give a positive response

00:10:45.212 --> 00:10:47.391
after the performance
than they were [before].

00:10:47.415 --> 00:10:50.738
They literally redefined themselves
and their history.

00:10:52.974 --> 00:10:59.077
So, awe is possibly the perception
that is bigger than us.

00:11:00.823 --> 00:11:02.871
And in the words of Joseph Campbell,

00:11:02.895 --> 00:11:05.934
"Awe is what enables us to move forward."

00:11:06.522 --> 00:11:08.450
Or in the words of a dear friend,

00:11:08.474 --> 00:11:10.656
probably one of our
greatest photographers,

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.752
still living photographers,
Duane Michaels,

00:11:12.776 --> 00:11:14.371
he said to me just the other day

00:11:14.395 --> 00:11:18.831
that maybe it gives us the curiosity
to overcome our cowardice.

00:11:20.752 --> 00:11:24.092
So who cares? Why should we care?

00:11:24.534 --> 00:11:25.868
Well, consider conflict,

00:11:25.892 --> 00:11:29.225
which seems to be so omnipresent
in our society at the moment.

00:11:29.249 --> 00:11:31.026
If you and I are in conflict,

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.006
it's as if we're at the opposite
ends of the same line.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:37.275
And my aim is to prove that you're wrong
and to shift you towards me.

00:11:37.299 --> 00:11:39.538
The problem is, you are doing
exactly the same.

00:11:39.562 --> 00:11:42.736
You're trying to prove that I'm wrong
and shift me towards you.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:47.858
Notice that conflict is the setup
to win but not learn.

00:11:48.525 --> 00:11:51.155
Your brain only learns if we move.

00:11:51.179 --> 00:11:53.048
Life is movement.

00:11:54.555 --> 00:11:59.952
So, what if we could use awe,
not to get rid of conflict --

00:11:59.976 --> 00:12:03.514
conflict is essential,
conflict is how your brain expands,

00:12:03.538 --> 00:12:05.395
it's how your brain learns --

00:12:05.419 --> 00:12:08.696
but rather, to enter conflict
in a different way?

00:12:09.561 --> 00:12:12.795
And what if awe could
enable us to enter it

00:12:12.819 --> 00:12:14.304
in at least two different ways?

00:12:14.328 --> 00:12:17.708
One, to give us the humility
and courage to not know.

00:12:18.466 --> 00:12:22.514
Right? To enter conflict
with a question instead of an answer.

00:12:22.538 --> 00:12:23.941
What would happen then?

00:12:23.965 --> 00:12:27.261
To enter the conflict
with uncertainty instead of certainty.

00:12:27.798 --> 00:12:30.512
And the second is,
in entering conflict that way,

00:12:30.536 --> 00:12:34.091
to seek to understand,
rather than convince.

00:12:35.377 --> 00:12:38.884
Because everyone makes sense
to themselves, right?

00:12:39.461 --> 00:12:41.057
And to understand another person,

00:12:41.081 --> 00:12:43.104
is to understand the biases
and assumptions

00:12:43.128 --> 00:12:44.775
that give rise to their behavior.

00:12:46.493 --> 00:12:49.156
And we've actually initiated a pilot study

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.586
to look to see whether
we could use art-induced awe

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:54.863
to facilitate toleration.

00:12:55.895 --> 00:12:58.553
And the results are actually
incredibly positive.

00:12:58.577 --> 00:13:01.604
We can mitigate against anger and hate

00:13:01.628 --> 00:13:04.773
through the experience of awe
generated by art.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:10.001
So where can we find awe,

00:13:10.025 --> 00:13:11.758
given how important it is?

00:13:14.914 --> 00:13:17.070
So, what if ...

00:13:18.747 --> 00:13:20.533
A suggestion:

00:13:20.557 --> 00:13:24.265
that awe is not just
to be found in the grandeur.

00:13:24.914 --> 00:13:26.084
Awe is essential.

00:13:26.108 --> 00:13:30.452
Often, it's scale --
the mountains, the sunscape.

00:13:31.506 --> 00:13:35.048
But what if we could actually
rescale ourselves

00:13:36.356 --> 00:13:39.554
and find the impossible in the simple?

00:13:41.165 --> 00:13:42.487
And if this is true,

00:13:43.431 --> 00:13:46.763
and our data are right,

00:13:46.787 --> 00:13:49.200
then endeavors like science,

00:13:49.224 --> 00:13:53.255
adventure, art, ideas, love,

00:13:53.279 --> 00:13:56.131
a TED conference, performance,

00:13:57.171 --> 00:14:00.104
are not only inspired by awe,

00:14:01.029 --> 00:14:04.871
but could actually be our ladders
into uncertainty

00:14:05.897 --> 00:14:07.414
to help us expand.

00:14:26.736 --> 00:14:28.077
Thank you very much.

00:14:28.101 --> 00:14:29.252
(Applause)

00:14:29.276 --> 00:14:30.427
Please, come up.

00:14:30.451 --> 00:14:34.449
(Applause)

00:14:34.473 --> 00:14:38.554
(Cheers)

00:14:38.578 --> 00:14:45.119
(Applause)
