00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.360
Ethic, Hedge, and Adila, the leader 
of the revolution,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.539
plot out how they can steal an artifact 
called the Node of Power.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.096
It’s being used to run a heavily fortified
train that runs all around the country,

00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:39.826
providing supplies 
to settlements and facilities.

00:00:39.826 --> 00:00:41.454
This armored behemoth

00:00:41.454 --> 00:00:45.442
undergoes a complex and unpredictable
unloading procedure—

00:00:45.442 --> 00:00:50.826
a procedure which is displayed, in detail,
on a screen within the engine car.

00:00:50.826 --> 00:00:54.386
Right means the train will go one 
car length forward,

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:58.387
and left means the train will go the 
same distance backwards.

00:00:58.387 --> 00:01:02.229
While unloading, the train frequently 
moves back and forth,

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:07.189
so a typical sequence 
might look like this.

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.274
Also within the engine car is a button 
that can only be pressed once.

00:01:12.274 --> 00:01:17.664
When pressed, it lets down the force 
field over the artifact for 10 seconds.

00:01:17.664 --> 00:01:21.414
The engine car is tiny 
and designed for a robot.

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:24.809
Of your team, only Hedge can fit.

00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:28.717
The members of the resistance have 
positioned a crane over the train tracks

00:01:28.717 --> 00:01:31.884
that can pluck the artifact 
once it’s exposed.

00:01:31.884 --> 00:01:34.879
They’ll know when to lower 
the crane by sight.

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:38.239
But the only way Hedge can determine 
the train’s position

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:40.526
and know when to lower 
the force field

00:01:40.526 --> 00:01:43.654
is by analyzing the unloading procedure,

00:01:43.654 --> 00:01:47.622
because he’ll be inside 
the windowless engine car.

00:01:47.622 --> 00:01:52.998
Hedge can’t program himself though, so 
it’s up to Ethic to tell him what to do.

00:01:52.998 --> 00:01:56.618
The artifact is in the car 
10 positions behind

00:01:56.618 --> 00:01:59.781
the one that’s directly under the 
crane at the start.

00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:02.485
What instructions can Ethic give Hedge

00:02:02.485 --> 00:02:06.233
so that he hits the button 
at just the right moment?

00:02:13.506 --> 00:02:17.056
Here’s a hint to get you started.

00:02:17.056 --> 00:02:20.913
The key to this problem, as with many 
programming challenges,

00:02:20.913 --> 00:02:25.294
is to reframe the information in a way 
that a computer can work with.

00:02:25.294 --> 00:02:29.914
A computer doesn’t know 
what a train is, nor does it need to.

00:02:29.914 --> 00:02:33.024
It can, however, work with variables.

00:02:33.024 --> 00:02:37.337
Try making a variable that tracks 
the train’s position.

00:02:37.337 --> 00:02:40.294
How will it change as the train moves?

00:02:46.362 --> 00:02:50.012
Let’s start by breaking this problem 
into two objectives.

00:02:50.012 --> 00:02:54.885
The first is to know where the train will 
be as it carries out its instructions.

00:02:54.885 --> 00:03:00.069
The second is to hit the button when 
the train is in just the right position.

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.738
For the first objective it’ll help to 
think of the train as a big number line.

00:03:04.738 --> 00:03:09.592
Let’s make 0 the car with the node, 
1 the car in front of it, and so on.

00:03:09.592 --> 00:03:13.282
That means car 10 is under 
the crane at the start.

00:03:13.282 --> 00:03:17.731
When the train moves one car right, 
car 9 is under the crane.

00:03:17.731 --> 00:03:21.541
So a right arrow can be 
thought of as “subtract 1.”

00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:23.811
And when the train moves left 
from there,

00:03:23.811 --> 00:03:25.651
10 is back under the crane,

00:03:25.651 --> 00:03:29.408
making a left arrow the same as “add 1."

00:03:29.408 --> 00:03:33.863
Let’s set our train position variable 
to 10, since that’s where we start.

00:03:33.863 --> 00:03:38.193
We can now use a loop 
to read the instructions one at a time,

00:03:38.193 --> 00:03:43.297
adding or subtracting as we go, 
to track which car is under the crane.

00:03:43.297 --> 00:03:46.047
The nice thing about setting up 
the variable this way

00:03:46.047 --> 00:03:49.363
is that it tells us how far the node 
is from the crane.

00:03:49.363 --> 00:03:53.427
So as soon as the variable hits 0, 
Hedge should hit the button.

00:03:53.427 --> 00:03:55.237
And here’s what happens.

00:03:55.237 --> 00:03:58.911
Ethic gets into position on the crane 
while Hedge rushes off

00:03:58.911 --> 00:04:04.809
and slips into the engine car unnoticed, 
just before the train lurches to life.

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:09.702
It rolls 3 cars back. 1 forward, 
another 4 back.

00:04:09.702 --> 00:04:15.521
Then so far forward Ethic loses track 
before it reverses once more.

00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:18.542
When the artifact 
finally rolls into position,

00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:22.332
Adila lowers the crane,
hoping Ethic and Hedge got it right.

00:04:22.332 --> 00:04:26.704
At the last possible moment, 
the force field sputters and falls.

00:04:26.704 --> 00:04:31.715
Ethic swoops in, and lifts the 
Node of Power to freedom.

00:04:31.715 --> 00:04:34.625
When Ethic gives the node 
to Hedge for safe keeping,

00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:36.716
something incredible happens.

00:04:36.716 --> 00:04:40.566
The artifact shimmers to life 
with a vision of the past:

00:04:40.566 --> 00:04:45.372
When the crystal was unearthed, 
no one could make the console inside work.

00:04:45.372 --> 00:04:48.622
The government put out a call 
for people to try their luck with it,

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:50.074
one at a time.

00:04:50.074 --> 00:04:54.397
Ethic loved to figure out what made 
things tick, so she signed up.

00:04:54.397 --> 00:04:57.540
Within moments at the console, 
something clicked into place,

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.300
and she created her first robot.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.314
The government hired Ethic as 
chief robotics engineer on the spot.

00:05:05.314 --> 00:05:09.484
Within a year her creations ran almost 
every aspect of society,

00:05:09.484 --> 00:05:11.633
and the nation and its people thrived,

00:05:11.633 --> 00:05:15.108
no longer needing to toil 
in the fields and factories.

00:05:21.047 --> 00:05:27.810
The vision ends, and Hedge detects 
the second artifact in the 198forest,

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.270
to the southeast.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.606
Luckily, the train is going there next,

00:05:31.606 --> 00:05:34.640
and has just enough reserve 
fuel for the trip.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.197
Ethic and Hedge smuggle themselves aboard

00:05:37.197 --> 00:05:40.755
and find a hiding spot 
for the long journey ahead.
