00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:14.452
Cancer.

00:00:14.476 --> 00:00:18.977
It's a devastating disease
that takes an enormous emotional toll.

00:00:19.317 --> 00:00:23.214
Not only on the patient,
but the patient's loved ones, as well.

00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:28.382
It is a battle that the human race
has been fighting for centuries.

00:00:28.835 --> 00:00:31.668
And while we've made some advancements,

00:00:31.692 --> 00:00:34.073
we still haven't beaten it.

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:40.305
Two out of five people in the US
will develop cancer in their lifetime.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.817
Of those, 90 percent will succumb
to the disease due to metastases.

00:00:46.554 --> 00:00:52.077
Metastasis is a spread of cancer
from a primary site to a distal site,

00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:55.220
through the circulatory
or the lymphatic system.

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.649
For instance, a female patient
with breast cancer

00:00:59.673 --> 00:01:03.807
doesn't succumb to the disease simply
because she has a mass on her breast.

00:01:04.228 --> 00:01:07.022
She succumbs to the disease
because it spreads

00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:11.490
to the lungs, liver,
lymph nodes, brain, bone,

00:01:11.514 --> 00:01:14.712
where it becomes unresectable
or untreatable.

00:01:15.927 --> 00:01:18.776
Metastasis is a complicated process.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.426
One that I've studied
for several years now.

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:25.331
And something that my team
and I discovered recently

00:01:25.355 --> 00:01:29.109
was that cancer cells are able
to communicate with each other

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.276
and coordinate their movement,

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.022
based on how closely packed they are
in the tumor microenvironment.

00:01:36.887 --> 00:01:40.370
They communicate with each other
through two signaling molecules

00:01:40.394 --> 00:01:43.064
called Interleukin-6 and Interleukin-8.

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:46.910
Now, like anything else in nature,

00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:51.577
when things get a little too tight,
the signal is enhanced,

00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:56.117
causing the cancer cells
to move away faster from the primary site

00:01:56.141 --> 00:01:58.386
and spread to a new site.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.895
So, if we block this signal,
using a drug cocktail that we developed,

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:08.593
we can stop the communication
between cancer cells

00:02:08.617 --> 00:02:11.299
and slow down the spread of cancer.

00:02:12.514 --> 00:02:14.276
Let me pause here for a second

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.101
and take you back to when
this all began for me in 2010,

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:21.830
when I was just a sophomore in college.

00:02:22.346 --> 00:02:25.752
I had just started working
in Dr Danny Wirtz's lab

00:02:25.776 --> 00:02:27.642
at Johns Hopkins University.

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:33.672
And I'll be honest: I was a young,
naive, Sri Lankan girl,

00:02:33.696 --> 00:02:34.855
(Laughter)

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.997
who had no previous research experience.

00:02:38.537 --> 00:02:42.133
And I was tasked
to look at how cancer cells move

00:02:42.157 --> 00:02:44.815
in a 3D collagen I matrix

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:47.228
that recapsulated, in a dish,

00:02:47.252 --> 00:02:51.452
the conditions that cancer cells
are exposed to in our bodies.

00:02:52.117 --> 00:02:53.903
This was new and exciting for me,

00:02:53.927 --> 00:02:58.950
because previous work had been done
on 2D, flat, plastic dishes

00:02:58.974 --> 00:03:01.529
that really weren't representative

00:03:01.553 --> 00:03:05.220
of what the cancer cells
are exposed to in our bodies.

00:03:05.665 --> 00:03:07.951
Because, let's face it,

00:03:07.975 --> 00:03:12.148
the cancer cells in our bodies
aren't stuck onto plastic dishes.

00:03:13.006 --> 00:03:16.283
It was during this time
that I attended a seminar

00:03:16.307 --> 00:03:20.347
conducted by Dr Bonnie Bassler
from Princeton University,

00:03:20.371 --> 00:03:25.037
where she talked about how bacteria cells
communicate with each other,

00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:29.254
based on their population density,
and perform a specific action.

00:03:30.236 --> 00:03:35.185
It was at this moment that a light bulb
went off in my head, and I thought,

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.741
"Wow, I see this
in my cancer cells every day,

00:03:38.765 --> 00:03:40.479
when it comes to their movement."

00:03:40.908 --> 00:03:43.590
The idea for my project was thus born.

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:49.299
I hypothesized that cancer cells
are able to communicate with each other

00:03:49.323 --> 00:03:51.513
and coordinate their movement,

00:03:51.537 --> 00:03:55.823
based on how closely packed they are
in the tumor microenvironment.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.743
I became obsessed with pursuing
this hypothesis.

00:04:01.243 --> 00:04:04.030
And fortunately, I work for someone

00:04:04.054 --> 00:04:06.934
who is open to running
with my crazy ideas.

00:04:07.466 --> 00:04:10.124
So, I threw myself into this project.

00:04:10.665 --> 00:04:13.521
However, I couldn't do it by myself.

00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.108
I needed help.

00:04:15.442 --> 00:04:17.053
I definitely needed help.

00:04:17.593 --> 00:04:20.815
So we recruited undergraduate
students, graduate students,

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:23.434
postdoctoral fellows and professors

00:04:23.458 --> 00:04:27.347
from different institutions
and multiple disciplines

00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:30.485
to come together and work on this idea

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.442
that I conceived
as a sophomore in college.

00:04:33.935 --> 00:04:37.238
After years of conducting
experiments together

00:04:37.262 --> 00:04:40.794
and merging different ideas
and perspectives,

00:04:40.818 --> 00:04:44.141
we discovered a new signaling pathway

00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:49.260
that controls how cancer cells
communicate with each other and move,

00:04:49.284 --> 00:04:51.150
based on their cell density.

00:04:52.331 --> 00:04:54.015
Some of you might have heard this,

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.387
because most of social media knows it
as the Hasini effect.

00:04:58.411 --> 00:05:01.229
(Laughter)

00:05:01.253 --> 00:05:07.434
(Applause)

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.970
And we weren't done yet.

00:05:09.994 --> 00:05:14.018
We then decided that we wanted
to block this signaling pathway

00:05:14.042 --> 00:05:17.002
and see if we could slow down
the spread of cancer.

00:05:17.307 --> 00:05:19.978
Which we did, in preclinical
animal models.

00:05:20.458 --> 00:05:24.529
We came up with a drug cocktail
consisting of tocilizumab,

00:05:24.553 --> 00:05:27.538
which is currently used to treat
rheumatoid arthritis,

00:05:27.562 --> 00:05:32.440
and reparixin, which is currently
in clinical trials against breast cancer.

00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:37.998
And interestingly, what we found
was that this cocktail of drugs

00:05:38.022 --> 00:05:40.600
really had no effect on tumor growth,

00:05:40.624 --> 00:05:43.227
but directly targeted metastases.

00:05:43.982 --> 00:05:46.760
This was a significant finding,

00:05:46.784 --> 00:05:51.053
because currently, there aren't any
FDA-approved therapeutics

00:05:51.077 --> 00:05:53.696
that directly target the spread of cancer.

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:57.636
In fact, the spread of cancer, metastasis,

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.763
is thought of as a byproduct
of tumor growth.

00:06:01.168 --> 00:06:04.962
Where the idea is, if we can stop
the tumor from growing,

00:06:04.986 --> 00:06:07.720
we can stop the tumor from spreading.

00:06:07.744 --> 00:06:11.870
However, most of us know
that this is not true.

00:06:12.776 --> 00:06:16.482
We, on the other hand,
came up with the drug cocktail

00:06:16.506 --> 00:06:20.585
that targets metastasis
not by targeting tumor growth,

00:06:20.609 --> 00:06:24.276
but by targeting the complex
mechanisms that govern it,

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.447
through the targeting
of the Hasini effect.

00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:28.621
(Laughter)

00:06:29.244 --> 00:06:33.515
This work was recently published
in "Nature Communications,"

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:38.539
and my team and I received an overwhelming
response from around the world.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.910
Nobody on my team could have predicted
this sort of response.

00:06:42.934 --> 00:06:44.867
We seem to have struck a nerve.

00:06:45.267 --> 00:06:50.773
Looking back, I am extremely grateful
for the positive response that I received,

00:06:50.797 --> 00:06:53.861
not only from academia, but also patients,

00:06:53.885 --> 00:06:57.817
and people around the world
affected by this terrible disease.

00:06:58.807 --> 00:07:03.903
As I reflect on this success
I've encountered with the Hasini effect,

00:07:03.927 --> 00:07:08.693
I keep coming back to the people
that I was fortunate enough to work with.

00:07:09.678 --> 00:07:11.314
The undergraduate students

00:07:11.338 --> 00:07:16.444
who demonstrated superhuman powers
through their hard work and dedication.

00:07:16.886 --> 00:07:20.236
The graduate students
and the postdoctoral fellows,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.808
my fellow Avengers,
who taught me new techniques

00:07:23.832 --> 00:07:26.432
and always made sure I stayed on track.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:31.260
The professors, my Yodas
and my Obi-Wan Kenobis,

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:36.420
who brought their expertise into
making this work into what it is today.

00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:40.569
The support staff, the friends and family,

00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:43.133
people who lifted our spirits,

00:07:43.157 --> 00:07:46.690
and never let us give up
on our ambitious endeavors.

00:07:47.196 --> 00:07:50.347
The best kind of sidekicks
we could have asked for.

00:07:50.966 --> 00:07:54.033
It took a village to help me
study metastasis.

00:07:54.347 --> 00:07:58.060
And believe me, without my village,
I wouldn't be here.

00:07:59.205 --> 00:08:01.649
Today, our team has grown,

00:08:01.673 --> 00:08:06.331
and we are using the Hasini effect
to develop combination therapies

00:08:06.355 --> 00:08:10.434
that will effectively target
tumor growth and metastases.

00:08:10.458 --> 00:08:13.823
We are engineering
new anticancer therapeutics,

00:08:13.847 --> 00:08:17.482
to limit toxicity and to reduce
drug resistance.

00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:21.260
And we are developing
groundbreaking systems

00:08:21.284 --> 00:08:25.534
that will help for the development
of better human clinical trials.

00:08:26.474 --> 00:08:30.879
It blows my mind to think that all this,

00:08:30.903 --> 00:08:33.658
the incredible work that I'm pursuing --

00:08:33.682 --> 00:08:36.833
and the fact that I'm standing here,
talking to you today --

00:08:36.857 --> 00:08:40.024
all came from this tiny idea

00:08:40.048 --> 00:08:43.008
that I had when I was sitting
at the back of a seminar

00:08:43.032 --> 00:08:44.965
when I was just 20 years old.

00:08:46.325 --> 00:08:50.714
I recognize that right now,
I am on this incredible journey

00:08:50.738 --> 00:08:54.998
that allows me to pursue work
that I am extremely passionate about,

00:08:55.022 --> 00:08:59.005
and something that feeds
my curiosity on a daily basis.

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:04.978
But I have to say,
my favorite part of all of this --

00:09:05.002 --> 00:09:08.009
other than, of course, being here,
talking to you, today --

00:09:08.033 --> 00:09:12.966
is the fact that I get to work
with a diverse group of people,

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:18.902
who make my work stronger,
better and just so much more fun.

00:09:19.694 --> 00:09:22.392
And because of this, I have to say

00:09:22.416 --> 00:09:26.098
that collaboration is my favorite
superhuman power.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.391
And what I love about this power
is that it's not unique to me.

00:09:31.415 --> 00:09:33.049
It's within all of us.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.923
My work shows that even cancer cells

00:09:36.947 --> 00:09:41.248
use collaboration to invade our bodies
and spread their wrath.

00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:47.156
For us humans, it is a superpower
that has produced incredible discoveries

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.580
in the medical and scientific field.

00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.363
And it is the superpower
that we can all turn to

00:09:53.387 --> 00:09:57.077
to inspire us to create
something bigger than ourselves,

00:09:57.101 --> 00:10:00.168
that will help make
the world a better place.

00:10:00.641 --> 00:10:06.170
Collaboration is the superpower
that I turn to, to help me fight cancer.

00:10:06.702 --> 00:10:10.662
And I am confident
that with the right collaborations,

00:10:10.686 --> 00:10:13.020
we will beat this terrible disease.

00:10:13.678 --> 00:10:14.829
Thank you.

00:10:14.853 --> 00:10:18.277
(Applause)
