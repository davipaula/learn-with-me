00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:16.379
Can you hear me OK?

00:00:16.403 --> 00:00:17.569
Audience: Yes.

00:00:17.935 --> 00:00:20.594
Jim Hudspeth: OK. Well, if you can,
it's really amazing,

00:00:20.618 --> 00:00:24.768
because my voice is changing
the air pressure where you sit

00:00:24.792 --> 00:00:28.073
by just a few billionths
of the atmospheric level,

00:00:28.097 --> 00:00:29.632
yet we take it for granted

00:00:29.656 --> 00:00:33.031
that your ears can capture
that infinitesimal signal

00:00:33.055 --> 00:00:37.555
and use it to signal to the brain
the full range of auditory experiences:

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.449
the human voice, music, the natural world.

00:00:42.349 --> 00:00:44.005
How does your ear do that?

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:45.787
And the answer to that is:

00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:49.312
through the cells that are the real hero
of this presentation --

00:00:49.336 --> 00:00:51.533
the ear's sensory receptors,

00:00:51.557 --> 00:00:53.642
which are called "hair cells."

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:57.652
Now, these hair cells
are unfortunately named,

00:00:57.676 --> 00:01:00.525
because they have nothing at all
to do with the kind of hair

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:02.226
of which I have less and less.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.197
These cells were originally named that
by early microscopists,

00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:10.621
who noticed that emanating
from one end of the cell

00:01:10.645 --> 00:01:12.860
was a little cluster of bristles.

00:01:13.227 --> 00:01:16.674
With modern electron microscopy,
we can see much better

00:01:16.698 --> 00:01:20.512
the nature of the special feature
that gives the hair cell its name.

00:01:20.536 --> 00:01:22.160
That's the hair bundle.

00:01:22.184 --> 00:01:28.528
It's this cluster of 20 to several
hundred fine cylindrical rods

00:01:28.552 --> 00:01:31.435
that stand upright
at the top end of the cell.

00:01:31.874 --> 00:01:37.552
And this apparatus is what is responsible
for your hearing me right this instant.

00:01:38.283 --> 00:01:41.386
Now, I must say that I am
somewhat in love with these cells.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.402
I've spent 45 years in their company --

00:01:44.426 --> 00:01:45.444
(Laughter)

00:01:45.468 --> 00:01:48.093
and part of the reason
is that they're really beautiful.

00:01:48.117 --> 00:01:50.051
There's an aesthetic component to it.

00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:52.164
Here, for example, are the cells

00:01:52.188 --> 00:01:55.417
with which an ordinary chicken
conducts its hearing.

00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:58.610
These are the cells
that a bat uses for its sonar.

00:01:59.142 --> 00:02:03.597
We use these large hair cells from a frog
for many of our experiments.

00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:07.716
Hair cells are found all the way down
to the most primitive of fishes,

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.144
and those of reptiles often have
this really beautiful,

00:02:11.168 --> 00:02:13.036
almost crystalline, order.

00:02:13.468 --> 00:02:15.409
But above and beyond its beauty,

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:18.171
the hair bundle is an antenna.

00:02:18.195 --> 00:02:23.914
It's a machine for converting
sound vibrations into electrical responses

00:02:23.938 --> 00:02:25.762
that the brain can then interpret.

00:02:26.707 --> 00:02:30.023
At the top of each hair bundle,
as you can see in this image,

00:02:30.047 --> 00:02:33.461
there's a fine filament
connecting each of the little hairs,

00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:35.161
the stereocilia.

00:02:35.185 --> 00:02:38.016
It's here marked with
a little red triangle.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.799
And this filament has at its base
a couple of ion channels,

00:02:41.823 --> 00:02:44.511
which are proteins that span the membrane.

00:02:44.535 --> 00:02:45.894
And here's how it works.

00:02:47.053 --> 00:02:50.400
This rat trap represents an ion channel.

00:02:50.424 --> 00:02:54.410
It has a pore that passes
potassium ions and calcium ions.

00:02:54.434 --> 00:02:58.847
It has a little molecular gate
that can be open, or it can be closed.

00:02:58.871 --> 00:03:04.400
And its status is set by this elastic band
which represents that protein filament.

00:03:05.242 --> 00:03:09.117
Now, imagine that this arm
represents one stereocilium

00:03:09.141 --> 00:03:12.223
and this arm represents
the adjacent, shorter one

00:03:12.247 --> 00:03:14.546
with the elastic band between them.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.656
When sound energy impinges
upon the hair bundle,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.839
it pushes it in the direction
towards its taller edge.

00:03:20.863 --> 00:03:23.661
The sliding of the stereocilia
puts tension in the link

00:03:23.685 --> 00:03:26.752
until the channels open
and ions rush into the cell.

00:03:27.255 --> 00:03:29.962
When the hair bundle is pushed
in the opposite direction,

00:03:29.986 --> 00:03:31.396
the channels close.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.847
And, most importantly,

00:03:32.871 --> 00:03:35.168
a back-and-forth motion
of the hair bundle,

00:03:35.192 --> 00:03:39.785
as ensues during the application
of acoustic waves,

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:42.330
alternately opens and closes the channel,

00:03:42.354 --> 00:03:46.547
and each opening admits millions
and millions of ions into the cell.

00:03:47.128 --> 00:03:49.624
Those ions constitute
an electrical current

00:03:49.648 --> 00:03:51.129
that excites the cell.

00:03:51.453 --> 00:03:53.881
The excitation is passed to a nerve fiber,

00:03:53.905 --> 00:03:56.100
and then propagates into the brain.

00:03:57.084 --> 00:03:59.092
Notice that the intensity of the sound

00:03:59.116 --> 00:04:01.837
is represented by
the magnitude of this response.

00:04:01.861 --> 00:04:04.744
A louder sound pushes
the hair bundle farther,

00:04:04.768 --> 00:04:06.251
opens the channel longer,

00:04:06.275 --> 00:04:07.780
lets more ions in

00:04:07.804 --> 00:04:10.380
and gives rise to a bigger response.

00:04:12.944 --> 00:04:16.711
Now, this mode of operation
has the advantage of great speed.

00:04:16.735 --> 00:04:19.229
Some of our senses, such as vision,

00:04:19.253 --> 00:04:22.018
use chemical reactions that take time.

00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:23.452
And as a consequence of that,

00:04:23.476 --> 00:04:27.806
if I show you a series of pictures
at intervals of 20 or 30 per second,

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.217
you get the sense of a continuous image.

00:04:30.714 --> 00:04:32.784
Because it doesn't use reactions,

00:04:32.808 --> 00:04:37.171
the hair cell is fully 1,000 times
faster than our other senses.

00:04:37.195 --> 00:04:42.094
We can hear sounds at frequencies
as great as 20,000 cycles per second,

00:04:42.118 --> 00:04:44.679
and some animals have ever faster ears.

00:04:44.703 --> 00:04:49.505
The ears of bats and whales, for example,
can respond to their sonar pulses

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:52.881
at 150,000 cycles a second.

00:04:53.905 --> 00:04:59.488
But this speed doesn't entirely explain
why the ear performs so well.

00:04:59.512 --> 00:05:03.812
And it turns out that our hearing
benefits from an amplifier,

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:06.099
something called the "active process."

00:05:07.004 --> 00:05:09.933
The active process enhances our hearing

00:05:09.957 --> 00:05:13.994
and makes possible all the remarkable
features that I've already mentioned.

00:05:15.034 --> 00:05:16.713
Let me tell you how it works.

00:05:17.658 --> 00:05:21.242
First of all, the active process
amplifies sound,

00:05:21.266 --> 00:05:26.305
so you can hear, at threshold,
sounds that move the hair bundle

00:05:26.329 --> 00:05:29.023
by a distance of only about
three-tenths of a nanometer.

00:05:29.047 --> 00:05:31.576
That's the diameter of one water molecule.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.980
It's really astonishing.

00:05:33.883 --> 00:05:38.066
The system can also operate

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.110
over an enormously wide dynamic range.

00:05:41.927 --> 00:05:43.861
Why do we need this amplification?

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:46.999
The amplification,
in ancient times, was useful

00:05:47.023 --> 00:05:51.929
because it was valuable for us to hear
the tiger before the tiger could hear us.

00:05:51.953 --> 00:05:56.945
And these days, it's essential
as a distant early warning system.

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:59.832
It's valuable to be able
to hear fire alarms

00:05:59.856 --> 00:06:05.772
or contemporary dangerous such as speeding
fire engines or police cars or the like.

00:06:06.542 --> 00:06:11.906
When the amplification fails,
our hearing's sensitivity plummets,

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.221
and an individual may then need
an electronic hearing aid

00:06:16.245 --> 00:06:18.958
to supplant the damaged biological one.

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:23.621
This active process also enhances
our frequency selectivity.

00:06:24.022 --> 00:06:27.271
Even an untrained individual
can distinguish two tones

00:06:27.295 --> 00:06:30.088
that differ by only
two-tenths of a percent,

00:06:30.112 --> 00:06:34.405
which is one-thirtieth of the difference
between two piano notes,

00:06:34.429 --> 00:06:36.767
and a trained musician can do even better.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.582
This fine discrimination is useful

00:06:39.606 --> 00:06:42.136
in our ability to distinguish
different voices

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.775
and to understand the nuances of speech.

00:06:44.799 --> 00:06:47.682
And, again, if the active
process deteriorates,

00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:50.566
it becomes harder to carry out
verbal communication.

00:06:51.423 --> 00:06:55.800
Finally, the active process is valuable
in setting the very broad range

00:06:55.824 --> 00:06:59.250
of sound intensities
that our ears can tolerate,

00:06:59.274 --> 00:07:03.073
from the very faintest sound
that you can hear, such as a dropped pen,

00:07:03.097 --> 00:07:05.312
to the loudest sound that you can stand --

00:07:05.336 --> 00:07:07.703
say, a jackhammer or a jet plane.

00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:12.810
The amplitude of sounds
spans a range of one millionfold,

00:07:12.834 --> 00:07:15.503
which is more than is encompassed
by any other sense

00:07:15.527 --> 00:07:18.327
or by any man-made device
of which I'm aware.

00:07:18.831 --> 00:07:21.385
And again, if this system deteriorates,

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:24.151
an affected individual
may have a hard time

00:07:24.175 --> 00:07:26.023
hearing the very faintest sounds

00:07:26.047 --> 00:07:29.226
or tolerating the very loudest ones.

00:07:30.122 --> 00:07:32.813
Now, to understand
how the hair cell does its thing,

00:07:32.837 --> 00:07:36.315
one has to situate it within
its environment within the ear.

00:07:36.792 --> 00:07:39.144
We learn in school
that the organ of hearing

00:07:39.168 --> 00:07:41.920
is the coiled, snail-shaped cochlea.

00:07:41.944 --> 00:07:44.271
It's an organ about
the size of a chickpea.

00:07:44.295 --> 00:07:47.579
It's embedded in the bone
on either side of the skull.

00:07:48.211 --> 00:07:51.037
We also learn that an optical prism

00:07:51.061 --> 00:07:55.182
can separate white light
into its constituent frequencies,

00:07:55.206 --> 00:07:57.644
which we see as distinct colors.

00:07:58.129 --> 00:07:59.800
In an analogous way,

00:07:59.824 --> 00:08:03.265
the cochlea acts as sort of
an acoustic prism

00:08:03.289 --> 00:08:07.666
that splits apart complex sounds
into their component frequencies.

00:08:08.139 --> 00:08:10.213
So when a piano is sounded,

00:08:10.237 --> 00:08:13.473
different notes blend
together into a chord.

00:08:13.497 --> 00:08:15.347
The cochlea undoes that process.

00:08:15.371 --> 00:08:18.939
It separates them and represents
each at a different position.

00:08:19.282 --> 00:08:21.604
In this picture, you can see
where three notes --

00:08:21.628 --> 00:08:24.443
middle C and the two
extreme notes on a piano --

00:08:24.467 --> 00:08:26.213
are represented in the cochlea.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.450
The lowest frequencies go all the way up
to the top of the cochlea.

00:08:30.474 --> 00:08:33.305
The highest frequencies,
down to 20,000 Hz,

00:08:33.329 --> 00:08:35.868
go all the way to the bottom
of the cochlea,

00:08:35.892 --> 00:08:39.726
and every other frequency
is represented somewhere in between.

00:08:40.171 --> 00:08:41.977
And, as this diagram shows,

00:08:42.001 --> 00:08:46.951
successive musical tones are represented
a few tens of hair cells apart

00:08:46.975 --> 00:08:48.827
along the cochlear surface.

00:08:49.442 --> 00:08:51.319
Now, this separation of frequencies

00:08:51.343 --> 00:08:55.139
is really key in our ability
to identify different sounds,

00:08:55.163 --> 00:08:56.774
because very musical instrument,

00:08:56.798 --> 00:08:58.015
every voice,

00:08:58.039 --> 00:09:01.113
emits a distinct constellation of tones.

00:09:01.523 --> 00:09:04.225
The cochlea separates those frequencies,

00:09:04.249 --> 00:09:08.031
and the 16,000 hair cells
then report to the brain

00:09:08.055 --> 00:09:09.865
how much of each frequency is present.

00:09:10.213 --> 00:09:13.220
The brain can then compare
all the nerve signals

00:09:13.244 --> 00:09:16.417
and decide what particular
tone is being heard.

00:09:17.623 --> 00:09:21.812
But this doesn't explain everything
that I want to explain.

00:09:21.836 --> 00:09:22.989
Where's the magic?

00:09:23.013 --> 00:09:26.907
I told you already about the great things
that the hair cell can do.

00:09:27.463 --> 00:09:29.870
How does it carry out the active process

00:09:29.894 --> 00:09:33.563
and do all the remarkable features
that I mentioned at the outset?

00:09:33.587 --> 00:09:35.586
The answer is instability.

00:09:36.046 --> 00:09:39.180
We used to think that the hair bundle
was a passive object,

00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:42.485
it just sat there, except
when it was stimulated.

00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:44.729
But in fact, it's an active machine.

00:09:44.753 --> 00:09:48.494
It's constantly using internal energy
to do mechanical work

00:09:48.518 --> 00:09:50.257
and enhance our hearing.

00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:53.612
So even at rest,
in the absence of any input,

00:09:53.636 --> 00:09:55.873
an active hair bundle
is constantly trembling.

00:09:55.897 --> 00:09:58.121
It's constantly twitching back and forth.

00:09:58.145 --> 00:10:00.564
But when even a weak sound
is applied to it,

00:10:00.588 --> 00:10:03.725
it latches on to that sound
and begins to move very neatly

00:10:03.749 --> 00:10:05.342
in a one-to-one way with it,

00:10:05.366 --> 00:10:09.821
and by so doing, it amplifies the signal
about a thousand times.

00:10:10.984 --> 00:10:15.740
This same instability also enhances
our frequency selectivity,

00:10:15.764 --> 00:10:18.481
for a given hair cell
tends to oscillate best

00:10:18.505 --> 00:10:21.355
at the frequency at which
it normally trembles

00:10:21.379 --> 00:10:23.264
when it's not being stimulated.

00:10:25.216 --> 00:10:30.598
So, this apparatus not only
gives us our remarkably acute hearing,

00:10:30.622 --> 00:10:33.409
but also gives us
the very sharp tuning.

00:10:37.139 --> 00:10:39.689
I want to offer you a short demonstration

00:10:39.713 --> 00:10:41.432
of something related to this.

00:10:41.456 --> 00:10:44.513
I'll ask the people who
are running the sound system

00:10:44.537 --> 00:10:48.087
to turn up its sensitivity
at one specific frequency.

00:10:48.111 --> 00:10:51.731
So just as a hair cell is tuned
to one frequency,

00:10:51.755 --> 00:10:56.416
the amplifier will now enhance
a particular frequency in my voice.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:01.474
Notice how specific tones emerge
more clearly from the background.

00:11:02.157 --> 00:11:04.817
This is exactly what hair cells do.

00:11:04.841 --> 00:11:09.449
Each hair cell amplifies and reports
one specific frequency

00:11:09.473 --> 00:11:11.360
and ignores all the others.

00:11:11.384 --> 00:11:15.463
And the whole set of hair cells,
as a group, can then report to the brain

00:11:15.487 --> 00:11:18.544
exactly what frequencies
are present in a given sound,

00:11:18.568 --> 00:11:21.295
and the brain can determine
what melody is being heard

00:11:21.319 --> 00:11:23.798
or what speech is being intended.

00:11:25.775 --> 00:11:29.136
Now, an amplifier such as
the public address system

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.051
can also cause problems.

00:11:31.075 --> 00:11:33.313
If the amplification is turned up too far,

00:11:33.337 --> 00:11:35.816
it goes unstable and begins to howl

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.146
or emit sounds.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.353
And one wonders why the active process
doesn't do the same thing.

00:11:40.377 --> 00:11:42.978
Why don't our ears beam out sounds?

00:11:43.396 --> 00:11:45.219
And the answer is that they do.

00:11:45.577 --> 00:11:49.996
In a suitably quiet environment,
70 percent of normal people

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.483
will have one or more sounds
coming out of their ears.

00:11:54.008 --> 00:11:55.358
(Laughter)

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:57.396
I'll give you an example of this.

00:11:59.811 --> 00:12:02.995
You will hear two emissions
at high frequencies

00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:04.793
coming from a normal human ear.

00:12:04.817 --> 00:12:07.716
You may also be able to discern
background noise,

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:09.102
like the microphone's hiss,

00:12:09.126 --> 00:12:12.926
the gurgling of a stomach,
the heartbeat, the rustling of clothes.

00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:21.876
(Hums, microphone hiss, 
dampened taps, clothes rustling)

00:12:29.941 --> 00:12:31.093
This is typical.

00:12:31.117 --> 00:12:33.029
Most ears emit just a handful of tones,

00:12:33.053 --> 00:12:35.245
but some can emit as many as 30.

00:12:35.634 --> 00:12:38.916
Every ear is unique, so my right ear
is different from my left,

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.978
my ear is different from your ear,

00:12:41.002 --> 00:12:42.450
but unless an ear is damaged,

00:12:42.474 --> 00:12:46.010
it continues to emit
the same spectrum of frequencies

00:12:46.034 --> 00:12:48.522
over a period of years or even decades.

00:12:49.031 --> 00:12:50.779
So what's going on?

00:12:50.803 --> 00:12:55.895
It turns out that the ear
can control its own sensitivity,

00:12:55.919 --> 00:12:57.659
its own amplification.

00:12:57.683 --> 00:13:00.963
So if you're in a very loud environment,
like a sporting event

00:13:00.987 --> 00:13:02.676
or a musical concert,

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.472
you don't need any amplification,

00:13:04.496 --> 00:13:06.686
and the system is turned down all the way.

00:13:07.177 --> 00:13:09.402
If you are in a room like this auditorium,

00:13:09.426 --> 00:13:11.569
you might have a little bit
of amplification,

00:13:11.593 --> 00:13:15.209
but of course the public address system
does most of the work for you.

00:13:15.233 --> 00:13:17.483
And finally, if you go into
a really quiet room

00:13:17.507 --> 00:13:18.962
where you can hear a pin drop,

00:13:18.986 --> 00:13:21.402
the system is turned up
almost all the way.

00:13:21.839 --> 00:13:25.327
But if you go into an ultraquiet room
such as a sound chamber,

00:13:25.351 --> 00:13:27.758
the system turns itself up to 11,

00:13:27.782 --> 00:13:29.163
it goes unstable

00:13:29.187 --> 00:13:31.496
and it begins to emit sound.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.716
And these emissions constitute
a really strong demonstration

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.795
of just how active the hair cell can be.

00:13:39.141 --> 00:13:43.677
So in the last minute, I want to turn
to another question that might come up,

00:13:43.701 --> 00:13:45.426
which is: Where do we go from here?

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.492
And I would say that there
are three issues

00:13:47.516 --> 00:13:50.293
that I would really like
to address in the future.

00:13:50.317 --> 00:13:52.700
The first is: What is the molecular motor

00:13:52.724 --> 00:13:56.000
that's responsible for
the hair cell's amplification?

00:13:56.024 --> 00:13:59.093
Somehow, nature has stumbled
across a system

00:13:59.117 --> 00:14:04.338
that can oscillate or amplify
at 20,000 cycles per second,

00:14:04.362 --> 00:14:05.686
or even more.

00:14:06.078 --> 00:14:09.261
That's much faster than any other
biological oscillation,

00:14:09.285 --> 00:14:11.974
and we would like to understand
where it comes from.

00:14:12.538 --> 00:14:16.376
The second issue is how the hair cell's
amplification is adjusted

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.602
to deal with the acoustic circumstances.

00:14:19.051 --> 00:14:23.120
Who turns the knob to increase
or decrease the amplification

00:14:23.144 --> 00:14:25.664
in a quiet or in a loud environment?

00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:29.349
And the third issue is one
that concerns all of us,

00:14:29.373 --> 00:14:34.094
which is what we can do
about the deterioration of our hearing.

00:14:34.118 --> 00:14:35.471
Thirty million Americans,

00:14:35.495 --> 00:14:38.297
and more than 400 million
people worldwide,

00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:40.884
have significant problems on a daily basis

00:14:40.908 --> 00:14:43.596
with understanding speech
in a noisy environment

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.037
or over the telephone.

00:14:45.553 --> 00:14:47.729
Many have even worse deficits.

00:14:47.753 --> 00:14:50.729
Moreover, these deficits
tend to get worse with time,

00:14:50.753 --> 00:14:52.730
because when human hair cells die,

00:14:52.754 --> 00:14:55.625
they're not replaced by cell division.

00:14:56.045 --> 00:14:59.993
But we know that nonmammalian animals
can replace their cells,

00:15:00.017 --> 00:15:03.423
and those creatures' cells are dying
and being replaced throughout life,

00:15:03.447 --> 00:15:05.822
so the animals maintain normal hearing.

00:15:06.587 --> 00:15:08.996
Here's an example
from a little zebra fish.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.645
The cell at the top
will undergo a division

00:15:11.669 --> 00:15:14.229
to produce two new hair cells.

00:15:14.253 --> 00:15:16.435
They dance for a little bit,

00:15:16.459 --> 00:15:18.589
and then settle down and go to work.

00:15:19.126 --> 00:15:22.675
So we believe that if we can decode
the molecular signals that are used

00:15:22.699 --> 00:15:26.174
by these other animals
to regenerate their hair cells,

00:15:26.198 --> 00:15:28.689
we'll be able to do
the same thing for humans.

00:15:29.048 --> 00:15:32.537
And our group and many other groups
are now engaged in research

00:15:32.561 --> 00:15:35.220
trying to resurrect
these amazing hair cells.

00:15:35.998 --> 00:15:37.482
Thank you for your attention.

00:15:37.506 --> 00:15:40.619
(Applause)
