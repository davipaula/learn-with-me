00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.640
Let me tell you about rock snot.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.616
Since 1992, Dr. Max Bothwell,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.656
a Government of Canada scientist,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.616
has been studying a type of algae
that grows on rocks.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.216
Now, the very unscientific term
for that algae is rock snot,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.656
because as you can imagine,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.360
it looks a lot like snot.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.736
But scientists also call it
Didymosphenia geminata

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.096
and for decades, this algae
has been sliming up riverbeds

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.256
around the world.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.816
The problem with this algae

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.736
is that it is a threat to salmon, to trout

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.416
and the river ecosystems it invades.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.656
Now, it turns out Canada's Dr. Bothwell

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.856
is actually a world expert in the field,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.056
so it was no surprise in 2014

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.536
when a reporter contacted Dr. Bothwell

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.080
for a story on the algae.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.536
The problem was, Dr. Bothwell
wasn't allowed to speak to the reporter,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.296
because the government of the day
wouldn't let him.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.736
110 pages of emails

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.696
and 16 government communication experts

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.880
stood in Dr. Bothwell's way.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.056
Why couldn't Dr. Bothwell speak?

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.896
Well, we'll never know for sure,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.656
but Dr. Bothwell's research did suggest

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.536
that climate change
may have been responsible

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.080
for the aggressive algae blooms.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.920
But who the heck would want to stifle
climate change information, right?

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.056
Yes, you can laugh.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.976
It's a joke,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.840
because it is laughable.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.176
We know that climate change
is suppressed for all sorts of reasons.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.456
I saw it firsthand
when I was a university professor.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.016
We see it when countries pull out
of international climate agreements

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.176
like the Kyoto Protocol
and the Paris Accord,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.400
and we see it when industry fails
to meet its emissions reduction targets.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.696
But it's not just climate change
information that's being stifled.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.376
So many other scientific issues
are obscured by alternate facts,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.176
fake news and other forms of suppression.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.416
We've seen it in the United Kingdom,

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.376
we've seen it in Russia,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.016
we've seen it in the United States

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.776
and, until 2015,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.480
right here in Canada.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.656
In our modern technological age,

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.856
when our very survival
depends on discovery,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.656
innovation and science,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.816
it is critical, absolutely critical,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.856
that our scientists are free
to undertake their work,

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.176
free to collaborate with other scientists,

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.776
free to speak to the media

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.816
and free to speak to the public.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.616
Because after all,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.696
science is humanity's best effort
at uncovering the truth

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.256
about our world,

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.016
about our very existence.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.696
Every new fact that is uncovered

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.536
adds to the growing body
of our collective knowledge.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.296
Scientists must be free to explore

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.696
unconventional or controversial topics.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.376
They must be free to challenge
the thinking of the day

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.696
and they must be free

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.080
to present uncomfortable
or inconvenient truths,

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.216
because that's how scientists
push boundaries

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.255
and pushing boundaries is, after all,
what science is all about.

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:34.376
And here's another point:

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.856
scientists must be free to fail,

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.736
because even a failed hypothesis
teaches us something.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.936
And the best way I can explain that
is through one of my own adventures.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.920
But first I've got
to take you back in time.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.456
It's the early 1900s

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.480
and Claire and Vera
are roommates in southern Ontario.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.776
One evening during the height
of the Spanish flu pandemic,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.240
the two attend a lecture together.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.336
The end of the evening,
they head for home and for bed.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.576
In the morning, Claire calls up to Vera

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.040
and says she's going out to breakfast.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.336
When she returns a short while later,

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.336
Vera wasn't up.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.376
She pulls back the covers

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.000
and makes the gruesome discovery.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.840
Vera was dead.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.576
When it comes to Spanish flu,

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.816
those stories are common,

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.376
of lightning speed deaths.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.496
Well, I was a professor in my mid-20s

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.096
when I first heard those shocking facts

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.520
and the scientist in me
wanted to know why and how.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.256
My curiosity would lead me
to a frozen land

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.896
and to lead an expedition

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.096
to uncover the cause
of the 1918 Spanish flu.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:12.376
I wanted to test our current drugs against
one of history's deadliest diseases.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.176
I hoped we could make a flu vaccine

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.456
that would be effective against the virus

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.136
and mutation of it,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.400
should it ever return.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.016
And so I led a team, a research team,

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.576
of 17 men

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.536
from Canada, Norway, the United Kingdom

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.416
and the United States

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.656
to the Svalbard Islands
in the Arctic Ocean.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.016
These islands are between
Norway and the North Pole.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.240
We exhumed six bodies

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:53.456
who had died of Spanish flu
and were buried in the permafrost

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:58.720
and we hoped the frozen ground
would preserve the body and the virus.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.176
Now, I know what you are all waiting for,

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.320
that big scientific payoff.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.800
But my science story doesn't have
that spectacular Hollywood ending.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.536
Most don't.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.376
Truth is, we didn't find the virus,

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.576
but we did develop new techniques

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.216
to safely exhume bodies

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.320
that might contain virus.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.616
We did develop new techniques

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.216
to safely remove tissue

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.256
that might contain virus.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.536
And we developed new safety protocols

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.216
to protect our research team
and the nearby community.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.736
We made important contributions to science

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.256
even though the contributions we made

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.400
were not the ones originally intended.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.416
In science, attempts fail,

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.056
results prove inconclusive

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.520
and theories don't pan out.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.720
In science,

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.496
research builds upon the work
and knowledge of others,

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.056
or by seeing further,

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.096
by standing on the shoulders of giants,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.816
to paraphrase Newton.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.456
The point is, scientists must be free

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.496
to choose what they want to explore,

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.736
what they are passionate about

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.000
and they must be free
to report their findings.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.456
You heard me say

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:40.696
that respect for science
started to improve in Canada in 2015.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.736
How did we get here?

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.760
What lessons might we have to share?

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.976
Well, it actually goes back
to my time as a professor.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.576
I watched while agencies, governments
and industries around the world

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.136
suppressed information on climate change.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.416
It infuriated me.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.696
It kept me up at night.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:12.000
How could politicians
twist scientific fact for partisan gain?

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.216
So I did what anyone
appalled by politics would do:

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.536
I ran for office, and I won.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:27.816
(Applause)

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.376
I thought I would use my new platform

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.136
to talk about the importance of science.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:40.496
It quickly became a fight
for the freedom of science.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:45.776
After all, I was a scientist,
I came from the world under attack,

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.720
and I had personally felt the outrage.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.656
I could be a voice
for those who were being silenced.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.056
But I quickly learned
that scientists were nervous,

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.816
even afraid to talk to me.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.616
One government scientist,
a friend of mine,

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.200
we'll call him McPherson,

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.896
was concerned about the impact

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.136
government policies
were having on his research

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.616
and the state of science
deteriorating in Canada.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.816
He was so concerned, he wrote to me

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.816
from his wife's email account

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.456
because he was afraid
a phone call could be traced.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.776
He wanted me to phone
his wife's cell phone

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.856
so that call couldn't be traced.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.920
I only wish I were kidding.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:47.336
It quickly brought what was happening
in Canada into sharp focus for me.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.560
How could my friend of 20 years
be that afraid to talk to me?

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.016
So I did what I could at the time.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.000
I listened and I shared what I learned

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.256
with my friend in Parliament,

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:08.216
a man who was interested
in all things environment, science,

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.840
technology, innovation.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.176
And then the 2015 election rolled around

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.376
and our party won.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.576
And we formed government.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.320
And that friend of mine

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.816
is now the Prime Minister
of Canada, Justin Trudeau.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:34.456
(Applause)

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.936
And he asked if I would serve
as his Minister of Science.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.776
Together, with the rest of the government,

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:47.856
we are working hard to restore
science to its rightful place.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:53.296
I will never forget that day
in December 2015

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.336
when I proudly stood in Parliament

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.696
and proclaimed,

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.600
"The war on science is now over."

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:08.296
(Applause)

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.576
And I have worked hard
to back up those words with actions.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.056
We've had many successes.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.200
There's still more work to do,

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.096
because we're building this culture shift.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:27.056
But we want our government scientists
to talk to the media, talk to the public.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.536
It'll take time, but we are committed.

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:36.936
After all, Canada is seen
as a beacon for science internationally.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.280
And we want to send a message

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:44.816
that you do not mess
with something so fundamental,

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.640
so precious, as science.

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:54.696
So, for Dr. Bothwell, for Claire and Vera,

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.296
for McPherson and all those other voices,

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:04.136
if you see that science is being stifled,
suppressed or attacked,

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.856
speak up.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:11.536
If you see that scientists
are being silenced, speak up.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.376
We must hold our leaders to account.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:19.256
Whether that is
by exercising our right to vote,

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.616
whether it is by penning
an op-ed in a newspaper

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:28.496
or by starting a conversation
on social media,

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:34.496
it is our collective voice
that will ensure the freedom of science.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:39.136
And after all, science is for everyone,

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:45.896
and it will lead to a better,
brighter, bolder future for us all.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.136
Thank you.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.800
(Applause)
