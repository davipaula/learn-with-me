00:00:06.365 --> 00:00:08.173
When we hear the word radiation,

00:00:08.173 --> 00:00:13.120
it's tempting to picture huge explosions
and frightening mutations,

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.637
but that's not the full story.

00:00:14.637 --> 00:00:16.889
Radiation also applies to rainbows

00:00:16.889 --> 00:00:19.846
and a doctor examining an x-ray.

00:00:19.846 --> 00:00:21.846
So what is radiation really,

00:00:21.846 --> 00:00:25.092
and how much should we worry
about its effects?

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:28.026
The answer begins with understanding
that the word radiation

00:00:28.026 --> 00:00:31.627
describes two very different 
scientific phenomena:

00:00:31.627 --> 00:00:33.626
electromagnetic radiation

00:00:33.626 --> 00:00:36.202
and nuclear radiation.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:39.642
Electromagnetic radiation is pure energy

00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:43.638
consisting of interacting electrical
and magnetic waves

00:00:43.638 --> 00:00:46.146
oscillating through space.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:47.847
As these waves oscillate faster,

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:50.488
they scale up in energy.

00:00:50.488 --> 00:00:53.069
At the lower end of the spectrum,
there's radio,

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.879
infrared,

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.376
and visible light.

00:00:56.376 --> 00:00:58.279
At the higher end are ultraviolet,

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:59.213
X-ray,

00:00:59.213 --> 00:01:00.962
and gamma rays.

00:01:00.962 --> 00:01:06.109
Modern society is shaped by sending
and detecting electromagnetic radiation.

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:10.089
We might download an email to our phone
via radio waves

00:01:10.089 --> 00:01:12.449
to open an image of an X-ray print,

00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:16.720
which we can see because our screen
emits visible light.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.941
Nuclear radiation, on the other hand,

00:01:18.941 --> 00:01:21.230
originates in the atomic nucleus,

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.710
where protons repel each other
due to their mutually positive charges.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.710
A phenomenon known as
the strong nuclear force

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.402
struggles to overcome this repulsion

00:01:31.402 --> 00:01:33.917
and keep the nucleus intact.

00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:37.454
However, some combinations
of protons and neutrons,

00:01:37.454 --> 00:01:38.964
known as isotopes,

00:01:38.964 --> 00:01:40.990
remain unstable,

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.276
or radioactive.

00:01:43.276 --> 00:01:46.110
They will randomly eject matter
and/or energy,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.083
known as nuclear radiation,

00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:50.399
to achieve greater stability.

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.170
Nuclear radiation comes from natural
sources, like radon,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.509
a gas which seeps up from the ground.

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.146
We also refine naturally occurring
radioactive ores

00:02:00.146 --> 00:02:02.789
to fuel nuclear power plants.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.159
Even bananas contain trace amounts
of a radioactive potassium isotope.

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.576
So if we live in a world of radiation,

00:02:10.576 --> 00:02:13.603
how can we escape its dangerous effects?

00:02:13.603 --> 00:02:17.332
To start, not all radiation is hazardous.

00:02:17.332 --> 00:02:23.361
Radiation becomes risky when it rips
atoms' electrons away upon impact,

00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:26.000
a process that can damage DNA.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.636
This is known as ionizing radiation

00:02:28.636 --> 00:02:33.460
because an atom that has lost
or gained electrons is called an ion.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.012
All nuclear radiation is ionizing,

00:02:36.012 --> 00:02:40.640
while only the highest energy 
electromagnetic radiation is.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.987
That includes gamma rays,

00:02:41.987 --> 00:02:43.073
X-rays,

00:02:43.073 --> 00:02:46.078
and the high-energy end of ultraviolet.

00:02:46.078 --> 00:02:48.850
That's why as an extra precaution
during X-rays,

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.059
doctors shield body parts 
they don't need to examine,

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:55.929
and why beach-goers use sunscreen.

00:02:55.929 --> 00:03:01.086
In comparison, cell phones and microwaves
operate at the lower end of the spectrum,

00:03:01.086 --> 00:03:04.942
so there is no risk of ionizing radiation
from their use.

00:03:04.942 --> 00:03:08.709
The biggest health risk occurs
when lots of ionizing radiation

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.548
hits us in a short time period,

00:03:11.548 --> 00:03:14.440
also known as an acute exposure.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.233
Acute exposures overwhelm the body's
natural ability to repair the damage.

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:20.610
This can trigger cancers,

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.126
cellular dysfunction,

00:03:22.126 --> 00:03:24.638
and potentially even death.

00:03:24.638 --> 00:03:27.154
Fortunately, acute exposures are rare,

00:03:27.154 --> 00:03:31.562
but we are exposed daily to lower levels
of ionizing radiation

00:03:31.562 --> 00:03:35.324
from both natural and man-made sources.

00:03:35.324 --> 00:03:38.842
Scientists have a harder time quantifying
these risks.

00:03:38.842 --> 00:03:42.663
Your body often repairs damage
from small amounts ionizing radiation,

00:03:42.663 --> 00:03:43.856
and if it can't,

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:48.781
the results of damage may not manifest
for a decade or more.

00:03:48.781 --> 00:03:51.873
One way scientists compare ionizing
radiation exposure

00:03:51.873 --> 00:03:53.967
is a unit called the sievert.

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:59.376
An acute exposure to one sievert
will probably cause nausea within hours,

00:03:59.376 --> 00:04:02.175
and four sieverts could be fatal.

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:06.042
However, our normal daily exposures
are far lower.

00:04:06.042 --> 00:04:10.160
The average person receives 
6.2 millisieverts of radiation

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.726
from all sources annually,

00:04:12.726 --> 00:04:15.107
around a third due to radon.

00:04:15.107 --> 00:04:17.518
At only five microsieverts each,

00:04:17.518 --> 00:04:20.583
you'd need to get more 
than 1200 dental X-rays

00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:22.862
to rack up your annual dosage.

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:24.475
And remember that banana?

00:04:24.475 --> 00:04:27.084
If you could absorb 
all the banana's radiation,

00:04:27.084 --> 00:04:32.455
you'd need around 170 a day
to hit your annual dosage.

00:04:32.455 --> 00:04:34.580
We live in a world of radiation.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.318
However, much of that radiation
is non-ionizing.

00:04:38.318 --> 00:04:40.316
For the remainder that is ionizing,

00:04:40.316 --> 00:04:42.540
our exposures are usually low,

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.269
and choices like getting your home
tested for radon

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:47.007
and wearing sunscreen

00:04:47.007 --> 00:04:50.106
can help reduce 
the associated health risks.

00:04:50.106 --> 00:04:53.222
Marie Curie, 
one of the early radiation pioneers,

00:04:53.222 --> 00:04:55.541
summed up the challenge as follows:

00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:59.976
"Nothing in life is to be feared,
it is only to be understood.

00:04:59.976 --> 00:05:04.672
Now is the time to understand more,
so that we may fear less."
