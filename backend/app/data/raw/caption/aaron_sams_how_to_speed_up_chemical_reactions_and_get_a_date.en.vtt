00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:15.544
Meet our chemist, Harriet.

00:00:15.568 --> 00:00:18.926
She has a chemical reaction
that needs to occur more quickly.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.031
A chemist has some processes
at her disposal

00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:22.999
that can help her speed up her reaction,

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:24.673
and she knows of five ways.

00:00:24.697 --> 00:00:25.848
And to remember them,

00:00:25.872 --> 00:00:28.403
she thinks back to her days
as a high school student,

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:30.406
and the day she got a date for the dance.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.870
Harriet was in high school,
studying between classes.

00:00:33.894 --> 00:00:36.789
She had lost track of time
and was going to be late to class.

00:00:36.813 --> 00:00:37.970
Unbeknownst to her,

00:00:37.994 --> 00:00:40.921
Harold, who was just around the corner,
was running late, too.

00:00:40.945 --> 00:00:42.421
They both sprinted to class

00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:45.620
and, as it happened, sprinted
directly into one another.

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:47.423
Now, this was no small collision.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:49.708
They ran squarely
into one another in such a way

00:00:49.732 --> 00:00:51.997
that he knocked the books
right out of her hand.

00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:54.718
"I'm sorry," he said. "Let me
help you with your books."

00:00:54.742 --> 00:00:56.957
He kindly helped her
re-collect her belongings,

00:00:56.981 --> 00:00:59.004
and politely offered to walk her to class.

00:00:59.028 --> 00:01:02.417
And you'll never guess who went
together to the dance later that year.

00:01:02.441 --> 00:01:03.760
Yup, those two.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.143
So as we can see from this example,

00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:09.285
the key to getting a date for the dance
is to collide with someone

00:01:09.309 --> 00:01:11.178
and knock the books out of their hands.

00:01:11.202 --> 00:01:12.828
Now, you're probably already aware

00:01:12.852 --> 00:01:15.285
that not all collisions lead
to dates for the dance,

00:01:15.309 --> 00:01:16.469
thankfully.

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:19.070
The collisions must have
two important characteristics:

00:01:19.094 --> 00:01:22.783
One, correct orientation that allows
books to be knocked from one's hands;

00:01:22.807 --> 00:01:24.985
and two, enough energy
to knock the books out.

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.395
Shortly after this incident,

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:29.451
Harriet decided to tell me,
her chemistry teacher, all about it.

00:01:29.475 --> 00:01:31.216
I noticed some interesting parallels

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.401
between her story
and chemical reaction rates,

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:36.120
which happened to be
what she was studying in the hallway

00:01:36.144 --> 00:01:37.342
the day of the collision.

00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:39.899
Together, we decided
to set out on two missions.

00:01:39.923 --> 00:01:42.660
Harriet wanted to help all
chemistry students and chemists

00:01:42.684 --> 00:01:45.350
remember how to speed up
the rate of chemical reactions

00:01:45.374 --> 00:01:47.105
and I, being the nice guy that I am,

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:50.399
decided to make it my mission
to help create educational environments

00:01:50.423 --> 00:01:52.915
in which more book-dropping
collisions can take place

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.658
to increase future chemists' chances
of getting a date for the dance.

00:01:56.682 --> 00:01:59.976
In order to facilitate this improved
dance-date-getting process,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.976
I propose five changes to all schools

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.851
that parallel Harriet's five ways
to increase chemical reaction rates.

00:02:06.454 --> 00:02:09.343
First, I propose that we shrink
the size of the hallways.

00:02:09.367 --> 00:02:12.382
This will make it more difficult
to safely navigate the hallways

00:02:12.406 --> 00:02:15.014
and will cause more collisions
than in larger hallways.

00:02:15.038 --> 00:02:17.046
And by increasing
the number of collisions,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.316
we increase the likelihood

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.229
that some of those collisions
will have the correct alignment

00:02:21.253 --> 00:02:23.766
and enough energy
to create a date to the dance.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.990
Now, chemically speaking,

00:02:25.014 --> 00:02:27.933
this is equivalent to lowering
the volume of a reaction vessel

00:02:27.957 --> 00:02:29.246
or a reaction mixture.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.417
In doing so, the individual
particles are closer together,

00:02:32.441 --> 00:02:34.076
and more collisions will occur.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.186
More collisions means a greater likelihood

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.414
that collisions with the appropriate
energy and configuration will happen.

00:02:40.438 --> 00:02:44.398
Second, I propose increasing
the overall population of the school.

00:02:44.422 --> 00:02:46.583
More students equals more collisions.

00:02:47.513 --> 00:02:50.464
By increasing the number of particles
available for collision,

00:02:50.488 --> 00:02:53.448
we create an environment
where more collisions can take place.

00:02:53.472 --> 00:02:56.186
Third, we must reduce the time
allowed between classes --

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.751
heck, let's just cut it in half.

00:02:57.775 --> 00:03:00.220
In doing so, students
will need to move more quickly

00:03:00.244 --> 00:03:01.879
to get from one class to the next.

00:03:01.903 --> 00:03:04.032
This increase in velocity
will help make sure

00:03:04.056 --> 00:03:06.786
collisions have the appropriate
amount of energy necessary

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.309
to ensure book-dropping.

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:11.773
This is analogous to increasing
the temperature of the reaction mixture.

00:03:11.797 --> 00:03:14.328
Higher temperature
means particles are moving faster.

00:03:14.352 --> 00:03:16.519
Faster-moving particles means more energy,

00:03:16.543 --> 00:03:19.528
and a greater likelihood
of the reaction-causing collision.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.464
Fourth, students must stop
traveling in packs.

00:03:23.488 --> 00:03:26.429
By traveling in packs,
the students on the outside of the pack

00:03:26.453 --> 00:03:29.396
insulate those in the middle
from undergoing any collisions.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.218
By splitting up, each student
has more area exposed

00:03:32.242 --> 00:03:34.948
that is available for a collision
from a passing student.

00:03:34.972 --> 00:03:38.164
When particles travel in packs,
the surface area is very small,

00:03:38.188 --> 00:03:40.539
and only the outside
particles can collide.

00:03:40.563 --> 00:03:43.603
However, by breaking up the clumps
into individual particles,

00:03:43.627 --> 00:03:45.811
the total surface area is increased,

00:03:45.835 --> 00:03:48.770
and each particle has
an exposed surface that can react.

00:03:49.975 --> 00:03:52.674
Fifth and finally, we hire a matchmaker.

00:03:52.698 --> 00:03:54.973
Is this colliding
and book-dropping too violent?

00:03:54.997 --> 00:03:58.481
Is there an easier way to get a date
that requires less initial energy?

00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:00.585
Then a matchmaker will help with this.

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:03.489
The matchmaker makes it easier
for a couple to get together,

00:04:03.513 --> 00:04:05.235
by coordinating the match.

00:04:06.136 --> 00:04:08.025
Our matchmaker is like a catalyst.

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.452
Chemical catalysts function
by lowering the activation energy --

00:04:11.476 --> 00:04:14.689
in other words, by lowering the energy
required to start a reaction.

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:16.911
They do this by bringing
two particles together

00:04:16.935 --> 00:04:20.384
and orienting them correctly
in space so that the two can meet

00:04:20.408 --> 00:04:24.273
at the correct configuration
and allow a reaction to take place.

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:27.336
So, to sum up: if a future chemist
wants a date for the dance,

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.239
he must collide with another person

00:04:29.263 --> 00:04:31.479
and knock the books out of their hands.

00:04:31.503 --> 00:04:34.227
And if a chemist wants to make
a chemical reaction occur,

00:04:34.251 --> 00:04:36.759
the particles must collide
in the correct orientation

00:04:36.783 --> 00:04:38.576
with an appropriate amount of energy.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.854
And both of these processes
can be accelerated,

00:04:40.878 --> 00:04:42.790
using the five methods I've described.
