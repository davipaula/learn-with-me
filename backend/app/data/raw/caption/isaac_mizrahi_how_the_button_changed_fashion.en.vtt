There are no bad buttons,
there are only bad people.

00:00:14.575 --> 00:00:15.577
How does that sound? OK?

00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:16.796
[Small thing.]

00:00:16.822 --> 00:00:18.060
[Big idea.]

00:00:19.356 --> 00:00:21.707
[Isaac Mizrahi on
the Button]

00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:25.383
No one knows who invented the button.

00:00:25.407 --> 00:00:28.841
It might have shown up
as early as 2000 BCE.

00:00:28.865 --> 00:00:31.148
It was decorative when it first started,

00:00:31.172 --> 00:00:33.396
just something pretty
sewn onto your clothes.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.659
Then about 3,000 years later,

00:00:35.683 --> 00:00:38.414
someone finally invented the buttonhole,

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:40.265
and buttons were suddenly useful.

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.040
The button and the buttonhole
is such a great invention.

00:00:44.064 --> 00:00:46.230
Not only does it slip
through the buttonhole,

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:48.099
but then it kind of falls into place,

00:00:48.123 --> 00:00:51.186
and so you're completely secure,
like it's never going to open.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.035
The design of a button hasn't changed much
since the Middle Ages.

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.347
It's one of the most enduring
designs in history.

00:00:58.371 --> 00:01:01.592
For me, the best buttons
are usually round.

00:01:01.616 --> 00:01:03.995
There's either a dome button
with a little shank,

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.553
or there's just this sort of round thing
with either a rim or not a rim,

00:01:08.577 --> 00:01:10.441
either two holes or four holes.

00:01:10.465 --> 00:01:13.174
Almost more important than the button
is the buttonhole.

00:01:13.198 --> 00:01:15.360
And the way you figure that out is:

00:01:15.384 --> 00:01:18.074
the diameter of the button
plus the width of the button,

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:19.428
plus a little bit of ease.

00:01:19.452 --> 00:01:22.500
Before buttons, clothes were bigger --

00:01:22.524 --> 00:01:24.398
they were more kind of amorphous,

00:01:24.422 --> 00:01:26.199
and people, like, wriggled into them

00:01:26.223 --> 00:01:28.513
or just kind of wrapped
themselves in things.

00:01:28.537 --> 00:01:32.266
But then fashion moved closer to the body

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.521
as we discovered uses for the button.

00:01:34.545 --> 00:01:40.990
At one time, it was the one way
to make clothes fit against the body.

00:01:41.014 --> 00:01:44.689
I think the reason buttons have endured
for so long, historically,

00:01:44.713 --> 00:01:47.701
is because they actually work
to keep our clothes shut.

00:01:47.725 --> 00:01:48.877
Zippers break;

00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:51.790
Velcro makes a lot of noise,
and it wears out after a while.

00:01:51.814 --> 00:01:54.655
If a button falls off,
you just literally sew that thing on.

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.171
A button is kind of there
for the long run.

00:01:57.195 --> 00:02:00.529
It's not just the most
elemental design ever,

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:04.629
it's also such a crazy fashion statement.

00:02:04.653 --> 00:02:08.018
When I was a kid, my mom knit me
this beautiful sweater.

00:02:08.042 --> 00:02:09.194
I didn't like it.

00:02:09.218 --> 00:02:10.760
And then I found these buttons,

00:02:10.784 --> 00:02:13.578
and the minute the buttons were
on the sweater, I loved it.

00:02:13.602 --> 00:02:16.536
If you don't have good taste
and you can't pick out a button,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.479
then let someone else do it, you know?

00:02:18.503 --> 00:02:19.653
I mean that.
