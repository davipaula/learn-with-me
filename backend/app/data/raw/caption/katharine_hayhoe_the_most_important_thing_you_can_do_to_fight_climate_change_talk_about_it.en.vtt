Reviewer: Camille MartÃ­nez

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:16.500
It was my first year
as an atmospheric science professor

00:00:16.524 --> 00:00:18.190
at Texas Tech University.

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.516
We had just moved to Lubbock, Texas,

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.042
which had recently been named
the second most conservative city

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.866
in the entire United States.

00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:30.600
A colleague asked me to guest teach
his undergraduate geology class.

00:00:30.624 --> 00:00:31.774
I said, "Sure."

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:35.670
But when I showed up,
the lecture hall was cavernous and dark.

00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:38.514
As I tracked the history
of the carbon cycle

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:41.164
through geologic time to present day,

00:00:41.188 --> 00:00:45.561
most of the students were slumped over,
dozing or looking at their phones.

00:00:46.124 --> 00:00:49.523
I ended my talk with a hopeful request
for any questions.

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.831
And one hand shot up right away.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.896
I looked encouraging, he stood up,
and in a loud voice, he said,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.737
"You're a democrat, aren't you?"

00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:02.419
(Laughter)

00:01:02.443 --> 00:01:04.378
"No," I said, "I'm Canadian."

00:01:04.402 --> 00:01:06.797
(Laughter)

00:01:06.821 --> 00:01:12.247
(Applause)

00:01:13.176 --> 00:01:14.986
That was my baptism by fire

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.085
into what has now become a sad
fact of life here in the United States

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:21.449
and increasingly across Canada as well.

00:01:22.196 --> 00:01:24.228
The fact that the number one predictor

00:01:24.252 --> 00:01:27.045
of whether we agree
that climate is changing,

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:28.783
humans are responsible

00:01:28.807 --> 00:01:32.442
and the impacts are increasingly
serious and even dangerous,

00:01:32.466 --> 00:01:36.710
has nothing to do with how much we know
about science or even how smart we are

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:40.108
but simply where we fall
on the political spectrum.

00:01:41.585 --> 00:01:43.784
Does the thermometer give us
a different answer

00:01:43.808 --> 00:01:46.087
depending on if we're liberal
or conservative?

00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:47.571
Of course not.

00:01:48.762 --> 00:01:52.904
But if that thermometer tells us
that the planet is warming,

00:01:52.928 --> 00:01:55.119
that humans are responsible

00:01:55.143 --> 00:01:56.491
and that to fix this thing,

00:01:56.515 --> 00:02:01.506
we have to wean ourselves off
fossil fuels as soon as possible --

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.137
well, some people would rather
cut off their arm

00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:06.506
than give the government
any further excuse

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.807
to disrupt their comfortable lives
and tell them what to do.

00:02:10.736 --> 00:02:14.609
But saying, "Yes, it's a real problem,
but I don't want to fix it,"

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:18.228
that makes us the bad guy,
and nobody wants to be the bad guy.

00:02:18.673 --> 00:02:23.434
So instead, we use arguments like,
"It's just a natural cycle."

00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:24.768
"It's the sun."

00:02:24.792 --> 00:02:25.943
Or my favorite,

00:02:25.967 --> 00:02:28.593
"Those climate scientists
are just in it for the money."

00:02:28.617 --> 00:02:30.545
(Laughter)

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.990
I get that at least once a week.

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.338
But these are just
sciencey-sounding smoke screens,

00:02:38.362 --> 00:02:41.267
that are designed to hide
the real reason for our objections,

00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:43.577
which have nothing to do with the science

00:02:43.601 --> 00:02:47.538
and everything to do
with our ideology and our identity.

00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:51.006
So when we turn on the TV these days,

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.649
it seems like pundit X is saying,

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:56.283
"It's cold outside.
Where is global warming now?"

00:02:56.307 --> 00:02:58.050
And politician Y is saying,

00:02:58.074 --> 00:03:00.395
"For every scientist
who says this thing is real,

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.276
I can find one who says it isn't."

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.963
So it's no surprise that sometimes we feel
like everybody is saying these myths.

00:03:07.935 --> 00:03:09.804
But when we look at the data --

00:03:09.828 --> 00:03:12.395
and the Yale Program
on Climate [Change] Communication

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.157
has done public opinion polling across
the country now for a number of years --

00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:20.310
the data shows that actually 70 percent
of people in the United States agree

00:03:20.334 --> 00:03:22.080
that the climate is changing.

00:03:22.104 --> 00:03:25.556
And 70 percent also agree
that it will harm plants and animals,

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.699
and it will harm future generations.

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:33.036
But then when we dig down a bit deeper,
the rubber starts to hit the road.

00:03:33.887 --> 00:03:39.077
Only about 60 percent of people think it
will affect people in the United States.

00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:43.322
Only 40 percent of people
think it will affect us personally.

00:03:44.674 --> 00:03:48.641
And then when you ask people,
"Do you ever talk about this?"

00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:53.489
two-thirds of people in the entire
United States say, "Never."

00:03:54.878 --> 00:03:58.395
And even worse, when you say,
"Do you hear the media talk about this?"

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:00.885
Over three-quarters of people say no.

00:04:02.633 --> 00:04:04.366
So it's a vicious cycle.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.236
The planet warms.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.791
Heat waves get stronger.

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:10.950
Heavy precipitation gets more frequent.

00:04:10.974 --> 00:04:12.871
Hurricanes get more intense.

00:04:12.895 --> 00:04:16.295
Scientists release yet another
doom-filled report.

00:04:16.734 --> 00:04:19.608
Politicians push back even more strongly,

00:04:19.632 --> 00:04:22.391
repeating the same
sciencey-sounding myths.

00:04:23.885 --> 00:04:26.527
What can we do to break
this vicious cycle?

00:04:27.085 --> 00:04:31.334
The number one thing we can do
is the exact thing that we're not doing:

00:04:32.307 --> 00:04:33.457
talk about it.

00:04:34.851 --> 00:04:36.779
But you might say, "I'm not a scientist.

00:04:36.803 --> 00:04:39.168
How am I supposed to talk
about radiative forcing

00:04:39.192 --> 00:04:42.128
or cloud parametrization
in climate models?"

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:44.990
We don't need to be talking
about more science;

00:04:45.014 --> 00:04:48.077
we've been talking about the science
for over 150 years.

00:04:48.585 --> 00:04:54.125
Did you know that it's been
150 years or more since the 1850s,

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:56.261
when climate scientists first discovered

00:04:56.285 --> 00:04:59.848
that digging up and burning
coal and gas and oil

00:04:59.872 --> 00:05:01.548
is producing heat-trapping gases

00:05:01.572 --> 00:05:04.267
that is wrapping an extra blanket
around the planet?

00:05:04.291 --> 00:05:05.892
That's how long we've known.

00:05:05.916 --> 00:05:10.093
It's been 50 years since scientists
first formally warned a US president

00:05:10.117 --> 00:05:11.957
of the dangers of a changing climate,

00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:14.445
and that president was Lyndon B. Johnson.

00:05:15.442 --> 00:05:18.855
And what's more,
the social science has taught us

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:23.825
that if people have built their identity
on rejecting a certain set of facts,

00:05:24.642 --> 00:05:29.799
then arguing over those facts
is a personal attack.

00:05:29.823 --> 00:05:31.926
It causes them to dig in deeper,

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.101
and it digs a trench,
rather than building a bridge.

00:05:36.083 --> 00:05:38.625
So if we aren't supposed to talk
about more science,

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:41.045
or if we don't need to talk
about more science,

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:43.275
then what should we be talking about?

00:05:43.299 --> 00:05:44.951
The most important thing to do is,

00:05:44.975 --> 00:05:48.739
instead of starting up with your head,
with all the data and facts in our head,

00:05:48.763 --> 00:05:49.991
to start from the heart,

00:05:50.633 --> 00:05:54.363
to start by talking about
why it matters to us,

00:05:55.708 --> 00:05:58.740
to begin with genuinely shared values.

00:05:59.335 --> 00:06:00.735
Are we both parents?

00:06:01.296 --> 00:06:03.271
Do we live in the same community?

00:06:03.628 --> 00:06:09.092
Do we enjoy the same outdoor activities:
hiking, biking, fishing, even hunting?

00:06:10.215 --> 00:06:12.867
Do we care about the economy
or national security?

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.086
For me, one of the most foundational ways
I found to connect with people

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.296
is through my faith.

00:06:18.705 --> 00:06:22.856
As a Christian, I believe that God created
this incredible planet that we live on

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.157
and gave us responsibility
over every living thing on it.

00:06:27.181 --> 00:06:29.978
And I furthermore believe
that we are to care for and love

00:06:30.002 --> 00:06:31.777
the least fortunate among us,

00:06:31.801 --> 00:06:34.519
those who are already suffering
the impacts of poverty,

00:06:34.543 --> 00:06:36.210
hunger, disease and more.

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:40.942
If you don't know what
the values are that someone has,

00:06:40.966 --> 00:06:44.577
have a conversation, get to know them,
figure out what makes them tick.

00:06:45.427 --> 00:06:47.434
And then once we have,

00:06:47.458 --> 00:06:52.807
all we have to do is connect the dots
between the values they already have

00:06:52.831 --> 00:06:55.355
and why they would care
about a changing climate.

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:59.329
I truly believe, after thousands
of conversations that I've had

00:06:59.353 --> 00:07:01.345
over the past decade and more,

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:03.633
that just about every single
person in the world

00:07:03.657 --> 00:07:06.783
already has the values they need
to care about a changing climate.

00:07:06.807 --> 00:07:09.187
They just haven't connected the dots.

00:07:09.211 --> 00:07:12.665
And that's what we can do
through our conversation with them.

00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:16.266
The only reason why I care
about a changing climate

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.963
is because of who I already am.

00:07:18.614 --> 00:07:21.590
I'm a mother, so I care
about the future of my child.

00:07:21.614 --> 00:07:24.772
I live in West Texas,
where water is already scarce,

00:07:24.796 --> 00:07:28.063
and climate change is impacting
the availability of that water.

00:07:28.903 --> 00:07:31.205
I'm a Christian, I care
about a changing climate

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:34.610
because it is, as the military calls it,
a "threat multiplier."

00:07:35.109 --> 00:07:36.903
It takes those issues,

00:07:36.927 --> 00:07:40.537
like poverty and hunger and disease
and lack of access to clean water

00:07:40.561 --> 00:07:44.037
and even political crises
that lead to refugee crises --

00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:46.578
it takes all of these issues
and it exacerbates them,

00:07:46.602 --> 00:07:47.935
it makes them worse.

00:07:49.046 --> 00:07:50.312
I'm not a Rotarian.

00:07:50.784 --> 00:07:52.982
But when I gave my first talk
at a Rotary Club,

00:07:53.006 --> 00:07:57.584
I walked in and they had this giant banner
that had the Four-Way Test on it.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.117
Is it the truth?

00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:01.291
Absolutely.

00:08:01.611 --> 00:08:02.769
Is it fair?

00:08:02.793 --> 00:08:05.428
Heck, no, that's why I care
most about climate change,

00:08:05.452 --> 00:08:07.015
because it is absolutely unfair.

00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:09.428
Those who have contributed
the least to the problem

00:08:09.452 --> 00:08:11.238
are bearing the brunt of the impacts.

00:08:11.262 --> 00:08:12.458
It went on to ask:

00:08:12.482 --> 00:08:15.204
Would it be beneficial to all,
would it build goodwill?

00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:16.823
Well, to fix it certainly would.

00:08:16.847 --> 00:08:21.720
So I took my talk, and I reorganized it
into the Four-Way Test,

00:08:21.744 --> 00:08:24.839
and then I gave it to this group
of conservative businesspeople

00:08:24.863 --> 00:08:26.013
in West Texas.

00:08:26.037 --> 00:08:27.117
(Laughter)

00:08:27.141 --> 00:08:29.029
And I will never forget at the end,

00:08:29.053 --> 00:08:33.182
a local bank owner came up to me
with the most bemused look on his face.

00:08:33.601 --> 00:08:37.224
And he said, "You know, I wasn't sure
about this whole global warming thing,

00:08:37.248 --> 00:08:39.868
but it passed the Four-Way Test."

00:08:39.892 --> 00:08:42.446
(Laughter)

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:46.359
(Applause)

00:08:50.037 --> 00:08:52.789
These values, though --
they have to be genuine.

00:08:53.345 --> 00:08:56.440
I was giving a talk at a Christian college
a number of years ago,

00:08:56.464 --> 00:08:59.940
and after my talk, a fellow scientist
came up and he said,

00:08:59.964 --> 00:09:01.165
"I need some help.

00:09:01.189 --> 00:09:04.510
I've been really trying hard
to get my foot in the door

00:09:04.534 --> 00:09:06.307
with our local churches,

00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:08.255
but I can't seem to get any traction.

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:11.068
I want to talk to them
about why climate change matters."

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:12.934
So I said, "Well, the best thing to do

00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:15.697
is to start with the denomination
that you're part of,

00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:18.212
because you share the most values
with those people.

00:09:18.236 --> 00:09:20.107
What type of church do you attend?"

00:09:20.609 --> 00:09:23.291
"Oh, I don't attend any church,
I'm an atheist," he said.

00:09:23.315 --> 00:09:24.484
(Laughter)

00:09:24.508 --> 00:09:27.452
I said, "Well, in that case,
starting with a faith community

00:09:27.476 --> 00:09:29.145
is probably not the best idea.

00:09:29.633 --> 00:09:32.853
Let's talk about what you do enjoy doing,
what you are involved in."

00:09:32.877 --> 00:09:35.045
And we were able to identify
a community group

00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:37.362
that he was part of,
that he could start with.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:40.708
The bottom line is, we don't have to be
a liberal tree hugger

00:09:40.732 --> 00:09:42.651
to care about a changing climate.

00:09:42.675 --> 00:09:46.083
All we have to be is a human
living on this planet.

00:09:46.913 --> 00:09:49.008
Because no matter where we live,

00:09:49.032 --> 00:09:52.872
climate change is already
affecting us today.

00:09:54.525 --> 00:09:56.786
If we live along the coasts,

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.742
in many places, we're already seeing
"sunny-day flooding."

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.474
If we live in western North America,

00:10:04.498 --> 00:10:07.943
we're seeing much greater area
being burned by wildfires.

00:10:09.098 --> 00:10:11.009
If we live in many coastal locations,

00:10:11.033 --> 00:10:13.463
from the Gulf of Mexico
to the South Pacific,

00:10:13.487 --> 00:10:17.617
we are seeing stronger hurricanes,
typhoons and cyclones,

00:10:17.641 --> 00:10:19.441
powered by a warming ocean.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.561
If we live in Texas
or if we live in Syria,

00:10:22.585 --> 00:10:25.014
we're seeing climate change
supersize our droughts,

00:10:25.038 --> 00:10:27.136
making them more frequent and more severe.

00:10:28.244 --> 00:10:31.546
Wherever we live, we're already
being affected by a changing climate.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.337
So you might say, "OK, that's good.
We can talk impacts.

00:10:34.361 --> 00:10:38.512
We can scare the pants off people,
because this thing is serious."

00:10:38.536 --> 00:10:40.774
And it is, believe me.
I'm a scientist, I know.

00:10:40.798 --> 00:10:42.252
(Laughter)

00:10:42.276 --> 00:10:45.887
But fear is not
what is going to motivate us

00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:49.709
for the long-term, sustained change
that we need to fix this thing.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.061
Fear is designed to help us
run away from the bear.

00:10:54.085 --> 00:10:56.442
Or just run faster
than the person beside us.

00:10:56.466 --> 00:10:57.616
(Laughter)

00:10:59.374 --> 00:11:03.892
What we need to fix this thing
is rational hope.

00:11:04.939 --> 00:11:08.379
Yes, we absolutely do need
to recognize what's at stake.

00:11:08.403 --> 00:11:09.553
Of course we do.

00:11:10.673 --> 00:11:14.226
But we need a vision of a better future --

00:11:15.179 --> 00:11:17.179
a future with abundant energy,

00:11:17.814 --> 00:11:19.663
with a stable economy,

00:11:19.687 --> 00:11:21.820
with resources available to all,

00:11:22.218 --> 00:11:26.510
where our lives are not worse
but better than they are today.

00:11:27.747 --> 00:11:30.016
There are solutions.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.151
And that's why the second important
thing that we have to talk about

00:11:34.175 --> 00:11:40.667
is solutions -- practical, viable,
accessible, attractive solutions.

00:11:41.307 --> 00:11:42.641
Like what?

00:11:42.665 --> 00:11:44.808
Well, there's no
silver bullet, as they say,

00:11:44.832 --> 00:11:47.276
but there's plenty of silver buckshot.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.069
(Laughter)

00:11:50.593 --> 00:11:52.696
There's simple solutions
that save us money

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.077
and reduce our carbon footprint
at the same time.

00:11:55.736 --> 00:11:57.148
Yes, light bulbs.

00:11:57.911 --> 00:11:59.377
I love my plug-in car.

00:11:59.841 --> 00:12:01.774
I'd like some solar shingles.

00:12:02.159 --> 00:12:07.123
But imagine if every home
came with a switch beside the front door,

00:12:07.147 --> 00:12:10.886
that when you left the house, you could
turn off everything except your fridge.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.135
And maybe the DVR.

00:12:12.159 --> 00:12:13.649
(Laughter)

00:12:13.673 --> 00:12:19.175
Lifestyle choices: eating local,
eating lower down the food chain

00:12:19.199 --> 00:12:22.295
and reducing food waste,
which at the global scale,

00:12:22.319 --> 00:12:26.310
is one of the most important things
that we can do to fix this problem.

00:12:26.334 --> 00:12:27.982
I'm a climate scientist,

00:12:28.006 --> 00:12:32.184
so the irony of traveling around
to talk to people about a changing climate

00:12:32.208 --> 00:12:33.820
is not lost on me.

00:12:33.844 --> 00:12:35.135
(Laughter)

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:39.221
The biggest part of my personal
carbon footprint is my travel.

00:12:39.675 --> 00:12:43.359
And that's why I carefully
collect my invitations.

00:12:43.383 --> 00:12:46.224
I usually don't go anywhere
unless I have a critical mass

00:12:46.248 --> 00:12:48.018
of invitations in one place --

00:12:48.042 --> 00:12:49.397
anywhere from three to four

00:12:49.421 --> 00:12:53.154
to sometimes even as many as
10 or 15 talks in a given place --

00:12:53.178 --> 00:12:55.972
so I can minimize the impact
of my carbon footprint

00:12:55.996 --> 00:12:57.249
as much as possible.

00:12:57.273 --> 00:13:00.661
And I've transitioned nearly
three-quarters of the talks I give

00:13:00.685 --> 00:13:01.835
to video.

00:13:02.284 --> 00:13:05.418
Often, people will say,
"Well, we've never done that before."

00:13:05.442 --> 00:13:08.474
But I say, "Well, let's give it a try,
I think it could work."

00:13:10.815 --> 00:13:12.046
Most of all, though,

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:16.411
we need to talk about what's already
happening today around the world

00:13:16.435 --> 00:13:18.363
and what could happen in the future.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.434
Now, I live in Texas,

00:13:20.458 --> 00:13:24.799
and Texas has the highest carbon emissions
of any state in the United States.

00:13:24.823 --> 00:13:27.736
You might say, "Well,
what can you talk about in Texas?"

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.767
The answer is: a lot.

00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:35.405
Did you know that in Texas
there's over 25,000 jobs

00:13:35.429 --> 00:13:36.796
in the wind energy industry?

00:13:37.315 --> 00:13:40.379
We are almost up to 20 percent
of our electricity

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:42.768
from clean, renewable sources,
most of that wind,

00:13:42.792 --> 00:13:44.411
though solar is growing quickly.

00:13:44.917 --> 00:13:47.606
The largest army base
in the United States, Fort Hood,

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.434
is, of course, in Texas.

00:13:50.175 --> 00:13:53.603
And they've been powered
by wind and solar energy now,

00:13:53.627 --> 00:13:57.374
because it's saving taxpayers
over 150 million dollars.

00:13:58.096 --> 00:13:59.247
Yes.

00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:03.683
(Applause)

00:14:04.445 --> 00:14:07.723
What about those who don't have
the resources that we have?

00:14:07.747 --> 00:14:10.717
In sub-Saharan Africa,
there are hundreds of millions of people

00:14:10.741 --> 00:14:13.625
who don't have access to any type
of energy except kerosine,

00:14:13.649 --> 00:14:15.442
and it's very expensive.

00:14:15.466 --> 00:14:17.291
Around the entire world,

00:14:17.315 --> 00:14:22.243
the fastest-growing type
of new energy today is solar.

00:14:22.911 --> 00:14:24.911
And they have plenty of solar.

00:14:26.196 --> 00:14:30.712
So social impact investors,
nonprofits, even corporations

00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:34.325
are going in and using innovative
new microfinancing schemes,

00:14:34.349 --> 00:14:36.278
like, pay-as-you-go solar,

00:14:36.981 --> 00:14:39.697
so that people can buy
the power they need in increments,

00:14:39.721 --> 00:14:41.409
sometimes even on their cell phone.

00:14:41.942 --> 00:14:45.139
One company, Azuri, has distributed
tens of thousands of units

00:14:45.163 --> 00:14:48.367
across 11 countries,
from Rwanda to Uganda.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:52.775
They estimate that they've powered
over 30 million hours of electricity

00:14:52.799 --> 00:14:55.333
and over 10 million hours
of cell phone charging.

00:14:56.792 --> 00:15:00.580
What about the giant growing
economies of China and India?

00:15:01.502 --> 00:15:04.518
Well, climate impacts might seem
a little further down the road,

00:15:04.542 --> 00:15:07.082
but air quality impacts
are right here today.

00:15:07.455 --> 00:15:11.484
And they know that clean energy
is essential to powering their future.

00:15:11.981 --> 00:15:17.582
So China is investing hundreds
of billions of dollars in clean energy.

00:15:17.606 --> 00:15:19.109
They're flooding coal mines,

00:15:19.133 --> 00:15:21.952
and they're putting floating
solar panels on the surface.

00:15:22.482 --> 00:15:24.450
They also have a panda-shaped solar farm.

00:15:24.474 --> 00:15:25.625
(Applause)

00:15:25.649 --> 00:15:27.109
(Laughter)

00:15:27.133 --> 00:15:29.053
Yes, they're still burning coal.

00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:32.168
But they've shut down
all the coal plants around Beijing.

00:15:32.538 --> 00:15:34.869
And in India, they're looking to replace

00:15:34.893 --> 00:15:38.784
a quarter of a billion
incandescent light bulbs with LEDs,

00:15:38.808 --> 00:15:42.077
which will save them
seven billion dollars in energy costs.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.782
They're investing in green jobs,

00:15:45.448 --> 00:15:48.689
and they're looking to decarbonize
their entire vehicle fleet.

00:15:48.713 --> 00:15:51.709
India may be the first country
to industrialize

00:15:51.733 --> 00:15:54.533
without relying primarily on fossil fuels.

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.577
The world is changing.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:00.730
But it just isn't changing fast enough.

00:16:01.236 --> 00:16:02.990
Too often, we picture this problem

00:16:03.014 --> 00:16:05.569
as a giant boulder
sitting at the bottom of a hill,

00:16:05.593 --> 00:16:08.585
with only a few hands on it,
trying to roll it up the hill.

00:16:08.609 --> 00:16:11.704
But in reality, that boulder
is already at the top of the hill.

00:16:11.728 --> 00:16:15.042
And it's got hundreds of millions
of hands, maybe even billions on it,

00:16:15.066 --> 00:16:16.296
pushing it down.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.625
It just isn't going fast enough.

00:16:19.292 --> 00:16:23.712
So how do we speed up that giant boulder
so we can fix climate change in time?

00:16:24.641 --> 00:16:25.965
You guessed it.

00:16:25.989 --> 00:16:28.978
The number one way is by talking about it.

00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:31.488
The bottom line is this:

00:16:32.797 --> 00:16:37.091
climate change is affecting you and me
right here, right now,

00:16:37.115 --> 00:16:38.796
in the places where we live.

00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:43.478
But by working together, we can fix it.

00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:44.995
Sure, it's a daunting problem.

00:16:45.019 --> 00:16:47.893
Nobody knows that more
than us climate scientists.

00:16:48.458 --> 00:16:50.592
But we can't give in to despair.

00:16:50.965 --> 00:16:54.474
We have to go out and actively look
for the hope that we need,

00:16:54.498 --> 00:16:56.590
that will inspire us to act.

00:16:57.465 --> 00:17:02.010
And that hope begins
with a conversation today.

00:17:03.053 --> 00:17:04.250
Thank you.

00:17:04.274 --> 00:17:10.343
(Applause)
