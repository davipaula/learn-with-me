00:00:05.684 --> 00:00:08.684
French fries are delicious.

00:00:08.684 --> 00:00:12.684
French fries with ketchup are a little slice of heaven.

00:00:12.684 --> 00:00:14.432
The problem is it's basically impossible

00:00:14.432 --> 00:00:16.463
to pour the exactly right amount.

00:00:16.463 --> 00:00:19.768
We're so used to pouring ketchup that we don't realize

00:00:19.768 --> 00:00:21.851
how weird its behavior is.

00:00:21.851 --> 00:00:26.430
Imagine a ketchup bottle filled with a straight up solid like steel.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.475
No amount of shaking would ever get the steel out.

00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:32.395
Now imagine that same bottle full of a liquid like water.

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:34.434
That would pour like a dream.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.851
Ketchup, though, can't seem to make up its mind.

00:00:36.851 --> 00:00:38.933
Is it is a solid? Or a liquid?

00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:41.654
The answer is, it depends.

00:00:41.654 --> 00:00:44.846
The world's most common fluids like water, oils and alcohols

00:00:44.846 --> 00:00:47.597
respond to force linearly.

00:00:47.597 --> 00:00:51.238
If you push on them twice as hard, they move twice as fast.

00:00:51.238 --> 00:00:54.355
Sir Isaac Newton, of apple fame, first proposed this relationship,

00:00:54.355 --> 00:00:57.739
and so those fluids are called Newtonian fluids.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.695
Ketchup, though, is part of a merry band of linear rule breakers

00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:03.286
called Non-Newtonian fluids.

00:01:03.286 --> 00:01:06.368
Mayonnaise, toothpaste, blood, paint, peanut butter

00:01:06.368 --> 00:01:09.870
and lots of other fluids respond to force non-linearly.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.915
That is, their apparent thickness changes

00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:15.336
depending on how hard you push, or how long, or how fast.

00:01:15.336 --> 00:01:18.551
And ketchup is actually Non-Newtonian in two different ways.

00:01:18.551 --> 00:01:22.849
Way number one: the harder you push, the thinner ketchup seems to get.

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:24.715
Below a certain pushing force,

00:01:24.715 --> 00:01:26.717
ketchup basically behaves like a solid.

00:01:26.717 --> 00:01:29.134
But once you pass that breaking point,

00:01:29.134 --> 00:01:33.384
it switches gears and becomes a thousand times thinner than it was before.

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:35.384
Sound familiar right?

00:01:35.384 --> 00:01:39.276
Way number two: if you push with a force below the threshold force

00:01:39.276 --> 00:01:41.569
eventually, the ketchup will start to flow.

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:45.158
In this case, time, not force, is the key to releasing ketchup

00:01:45.158 --> 00:01:46.992
from its glassy prison.

00:01:46.992 --> 00:01:49.620
Alright, so, why does ketchup act all weird?

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.634
Well, it's made from tomatoes, pulverized, smashed, thrashed,

00:01:52.634 --> 00:01:55.457
utterly destroyed tomatoes.

00:01:55.457 --> 00:01:56.801
See these tiny particles?

00:01:56.801 --> 00:01:58.586
This is what remains of tomatoes cells

00:01:58.586 --> 00:02:01.215
after they go through the ketchup treatment.

00:02:01.215 --> 00:02:02.925
And the liquid around those particles?

00:02:02.925 --> 00:02:05.967
That's mostly water and some vinegar, sugar, and spices.

00:02:05.967 --> 00:02:08.190
When ketchup is just sitting around,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.551
the tomato particles are evenly and randomly distributed.

00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:13.967
Now, let's say you apply a weak force very quickly.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.522
The particles bump into each other,

00:02:15.522 --> 00:02:17.218
but can't get out of each other's way,

00:02:17.218 --> 00:02:18.717
so the ketchup doesn't flow.

00:02:18.717 --> 00:02:21.777
Now, let's say you apply a strong force very quickly.

00:02:21.777 --> 00:02:24.613
That extra force is enough to squish the tomato particles,

00:02:24.613 --> 00:02:25.945
so maybe instead of little spheres,

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:28.827
they get smushed into little ellipses, and boom!

00:02:28.827 --> 00:02:30.784
Now you have enough space for one group of particles

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:33.633
to get passed others and the ketchup flows.

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:37.716
Now let's say you apply a very weak force but for a very long time.

00:02:37.716 --> 00:02:41.253
Turns out, we're not exactly sure what happens in this scenario.

00:02:41.253 --> 00:02:45.009
One possibility is that the tomato particles near the walls of the container

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:47.299
slowly get bumped towards the middle,

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:48.800
leaving the soup they were dissolved in,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.383
which remember is basically water,

00:02:50.383 --> 00:02:51.884
near the edges.

00:02:51.884 --> 00:02:54.383
That water serves as a lubricant betwen the glass bottle

00:02:54.383 --> 00:02:56.436
and the center plug of ketchup,

00:02:56.436 --> 00:02:58.551
and so the ketchup flows.

00:02:58.551 --> 00:03:01.941
Another possibility is that the particles slowly rearrange themselves

00:03:01.941 --> 00:03:05.801
into lots of small groups, which then flow past each other.

00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:08.133
Scientists who study fluid flows are still actively researching

00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:11.326
how ketchup and its merry friends work.

00:03:11.326 --> 00:03:13.411
Ketchup basically gets thinner the harder you push,

00:03:13.411 --> 00:03:16.498
but other substances, like oobleck or some natural peanut butters,

00:03:16.498 --> 00:03:19.301
actually get thicker the harder you push.

00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:21.717
Others can climb up rotating rods,

00:03:21.717 --> 00:03:24.090
or continue to pour themselves out of a beeker,

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.012
once you get them started.

00:03:26.012 --> 00:03:27.384
From a physics perspective, though,

00:03:27.384 --> 00:03:30.217
ketchup is one of the more complicated mixtures out there.

00:03:30.217 --> 00:03:32.467
And as if that weren't enough, the balance of ingredients

00:03:32.467 --> 00:03:35.300
and the presence of natural thickeners like xanthan gum,

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.934
which is also found in many fruit drinks and milkshakes,

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:39.605
can mean that two different ketchups

00:03:39.605 --> 00:03:41.549
can behave completely differently.

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.234
But most will show two telltale properties:

00:03:44.234 --> 00:03:46.069
sudden thinning at a threshold force,

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.321
and more gradual thinning after a small force

00:03:48.321 --> 00:03:50.365
is applied for a long time.

00:03:50.365 --> 00:03:53.327
And that means you could get ketchup out of the bottle in two ways:

00:03:53.327 --> 00:03:55.966
either give it a series of long, slow languid shakes

00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:58.467
making sure you don't ever stop applying force,

00:03:58.467 --> 00:04:02.504
or you could hit the bottle once very, very hard.

00:04:02.504 --> 00:04:04.717
What the real pros do is keep the lid on,

00:04:04.717 --> 00:04:07.132
give the bottle a few short, sharp shakes

00:04:07.132 --> 00:04:08.550
to wake up all those tomato particles,

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.428
and then take the lid off

00:04:10.428 --> 00:04:13.801
and do a nice controlled pour onto their heavenly fries.
