00:00:13.417 --> 00:00:15.851
Chris Anderson: Shep,
thank you so much for coming.

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:18.833
I think your plane landed
literally two hours ago in Vancouver.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.184
Such a treat to have you.

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:27.351
So, talk us through how do you get
from Einstein's equation to a black hole?

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:29.184
Sheperd Doeleman: Over 100 years ago,

00:00:29.208 --> 00:00:32.643
Einstein came up with this
geometric theory of gravity

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:34.768
which deforms space-time.

00:00:34.792 --> 00:00:36.393
So, matter deforms space-time,

00:00:36.417 --> 00:00:39.370
and then space-time tells matter in turn
how to move around it.

00:00:39.394 --> 00:00:42.934
And you can get enough matter
into a small enough region

00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:45.184
that it punctures space-time,

00:00:45.208 --> 00:00:46.893
and that even light can't escape,

00:00:46.917 --> 00:00:49.018
the force of gravity
keeps even light inside.

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:52.143
CA: And so, before that,
the reason the Earth moves around the Sun

00:00:52.167 --> 00:00:54.809
is not because the Sun
is pulling the Earth as we think,

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:56.976
but it's literally changed
the shape of space

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.101
so that we just
sort of fall around the Sun.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:01.018
SD: Exactly, the geometry of space-time

00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:03.101
tells the Earth
how to move around the Sun.

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:06.518
You're almost seeing a black hole
puncture through space-time,

00:01:06.542 --> 00:01:08.518
and when it goes so deeply in,

00:01:08.542 --> 00:01:12.018
then there's a point at which
light orbits the black hole.

00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:14.559
CA: And so that's, I guess,
is what's happening here.

00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:15.893
This is not an image,

00:01:15.917 --> 00:01:18.893
this is a computer simulation
of what we always thought,

00:01:18.917 --> 00:01:21.893
like, the event horizon
around the black hole.

00:01:21.917 --> 00:01:25.393
SD: Until last week, we had no idea
what a black hole really looked like.

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:29.351
The best we could do were simulations
like this in supercomputers,

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:31.351
but even here you see this ring of light,

00:01:31.375 --> 00:01:33.309
which is the orbit of photons.

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:36.059
That's where photons
literally move around the black hole,

00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:39.643
and around that is this hot gas
that's drawn to the black hole,

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:41.643
and it's hot because of friction.

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:45.018
All this gas is trying to get
into a very small volume, so it heats up.

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:47.893
CA: A few years ago,
you embarked on this mission

00:01:47.917 --> 00:01:50.101
to try and actually image
one of these things.

00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:52.000
And I guess you took --

00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:54.768
you focused on this galaxy way out there.

00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:56.601
Tell us about this galaxy.

00:01:56.625 --> 00:01:58.434
SD: This is the galaxy --

00:01:58.458 --> 00:02:02.268
we're going to zoom into the galaxy M87,
it's 55 million light-years away.

00:02:02.292 --> 00:02:03.518
CA: Fifty-five million.

00:02:03.542 --> 00:02:05.559
SD: Which is a long way.

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:07.226
And at its heart,

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.934
there's a six-and-a-half-billion-
solar-mass black hole.

00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.434
That's hard for us
to really fathom, right?

00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:16.726
Six and a half billion suns
compressed into a single point.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.143
And it's governing some of the energetics
of the center of this galaxy.

00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:24.643
CA: But even though that thing is so huge,
because it's so far away,

00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:27.559
to actually dream
of getting an image of it,

00:02:27.583 --> 00:02:28.851
that's incredibly hard.

00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:31.184
The resolution would be incredible
that you need.

00:02:31.208 --> 00:02:34.226
SD: Black holes are the smallest
objects in the known universe.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.018
But they have these outsize effects
on whole galaxies.

00:02:37.042 --> 00:02:38.309
But to see one,

00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:41.059
you would need to build a telescope
as large as the Earth,

00:02:41.083 --> 00:02:43.184
because the black hole
that we're looking at

00:02:43.208 --> 00:02:44.684
gives off copious radio waves.

00:02:44.708 --> 00:02:46.059
It's emitting all the time.

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:47.851
CA: And that's exactly what you did.

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:49.643
SD: Exactly. What you're seeing here

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:51.726
is we used telescopes
all around the world,

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.143
we synchronized them perfectly
with atomic clocks,

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:56.691
so they received the light waves
from this black hole,

00:02:56.715 --> 00:03:00.684
and then we stitched all of that data
together to make an image.

00:03:00.708 --> 00:03:02.000
CA: To do that

00:03:03.292 --> 00:03:04.601
the weather had to be right

00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:06.684
in all of those locations
at the same time,

00:03:06.708 --> 00:03:08.601
so you could actually get a clear view.

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:11.042
SD: We had to get lucky
in a lot of different ways.

00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:14.184
And sometimes, it's better
to be lucky than good.

00:03:14.208 --> 00:03:16.893
In this case, we were both,
I like to think.

00:03:16.917 --> 00:03:19.726
But light had to come from the black hole.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.684
It had to come
through intergalactic space,

00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:27.393
through the Earth's atmosphere,
where water vapor can absorb it,

00:03:27.417 --> 00:03:29.184
and everything worked out perfectly,

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:31.726
the size of the Earth
at that wavelength of light,

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.059
one millimeter wavelength,

00:03:33.083 --> 00:03:37.851
was just right to resolve that black hole,
55 million light-years away.

00:03:37.875 --> 00:03:40.684
The universe was telling us what to do.

00:03:40.708 --> 00:03:43.101
CA: So you started capturing
huge amounts of data.

00:03:43.125 --> 00:03:46.143
I think this is like half the data
from just one telescope.

00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:49.309
SD: Yeah, this is one of the members
of our team, Lindy Blackburn,

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:51.059
and he's sitting with half the data

00:03:51.083 --> 00:03:53.143
recorded at the Large
Millimeter Telescope,

00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:56.559
which is atop a 15,000-foot
mountain in Mexico.

00:03:56.583 --> 00:03:59.893
And what he's holding there
is about half a petabyte.

00:03:59.917 --> 00:04:03.184
Which, to put it in terms
that we might understand,

00:04:03.208 --> 00:04:07.143
it's about 5,000 people's
lifetime selfie budget.

00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:09.309
(Laughter)

00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:10.601
CA: It's a lot of data.

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.768
So this was all shipped,
you couldn't send this over the internet.

00:04:13.792 --> 00:04:15.643
All this data was shipped to one place

00:04:15.667 --> 00:04:18.976
and the massive computer effort began
to try and analyze it.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.768
And you didn't really know

00:04:20.792 --> 00:04:22.976
what you were going to see
coming out of this.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.268
SD: The way this technique
works that we used --

00:04:25.292 --> 00:04:28.642
imagine taking an optical mirror
and smashing it

00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:30.892
and putting all the shards
in different places.

00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:32.309
The way a normal mirror works

00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:35.143
is the light rays bounce
off the surface, which is perfect,

00:04:35.167 --> 00:04:38.309
and they focus in a certain point
at the same time.

00:04:38.333 --> 00:04:40.309
We take all these recordings,

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:41.893
and with atomic clock precision

00:04:41.917 --> 00:04:45.268
we align them perfectly,
later in a supercomputer.

00:04:45.292 --> 00:04:47.893
And we recreate
kind of an Earth-sized lens.

00:04:47.917 --> 00:04:50.893
And the only way to do that
is to bring the data back by plane.

00:04:50.917 --> 00:04:54.601
You can't beat the bandwidth
of a 747 filled with hard discs.

00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:55.643
(Laughter)

00:04:55.667 --> 00:04:58.143
CA: And so, I guess a few weeks
or a few months ago,

00:04:58.167 --> 00:04:59.809
on a computer screen somewhere,

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:03.101
this started to come into view.

00:05:03.125 --> 00:05:04.393
This moment.

00:05:04.417 --> 00:05:06.684
SD: Well, it took a long time.

00:05:06.708 --> 00:05:08.000
CA: I mean, look at this.

00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:11.101
That was it.

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:12.393
That was the first image.

00:05:12.417 --> 00:05:18.601
(Applause)

00:05:18.625 --> 00:05:20.934
So tell us what
we're really looking at there.

00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:22.309
SD: I still love it.

00:05:22.333 --> 00:05:25.268
(Laughter)

00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:29.184
So what you're seeing
is that last orbit of photons.

00:05:29.208 --> 00:05:32.726
You're seeing Einstein's
geometry laid bare.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.143
The puncture in space-time is so deep

00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:37.184
that light moves around in orbit,

00:05:37.208 --> 00:05:40.268
so that light behind the black hole,
as I think we'll see soon,

00:05:40.292 --> 00:05:43.226
moves around and comes to us
on these parallel lines

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.934
at exactly that orbit.

00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:49.601
It turns out, that orbit is
the square root of 27

00:05:49.625 --> 00:05:52.601
times just a handful
of fundamental constants.

00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:54.643
It's extraordinary
when you think about it.

00:05:54.667 --> 00:05:56.601
CA: When ...

00:05:56.625 --> 00:05:59.309
In my head, initially,
when I thought of black holes,

00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:01.226
I'm thinking that is the event horizon,

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.059
there's lots of matter and light
whirling around in that shape.

00:06:05.083 --> 00:06:08.268
But it's actually
more complicated than that.

00:06:08.292 --> 00:06:12.726
Well, talk us through this animation,
because it's light being lensed around it.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.101
SD: You'll see here that some light
from behind it gets lensed,

00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:20.518
and some light does a loop-the-loop
around the entire orbit of the black hole.

00:06:20.542 --> 00:06:22.018
But when you get enough light

00:06:22.042 --> 00:06:24.851
from all this hot gas
swirling around the black hole,

00:06:24.875 --> 00:06:27.768
then you wind up seeing
all of these light rays

00:06:27.792 --> 00:06:29.184
come together on this screen,

00:06:29.208 --> 00:06:31.643
which is a stand-in
for where you and I are.

00:06:31.667 --> 00:06:36.143
And you see the definition of this ring
begin to come into shape.

00:06:36.167 --> 00:06:39.542
And that's what Einstein predicted
over 100 years ago.

00:06:40.167 --> 00:06:42.226
CA: Yeah, that is amazing.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:48.018
So tell us more about
what we're actually looking at here.

00:06:48.042 --> 00:06:50.684
First of all, why is part of it
brighter than the rest?

00:06:50.708 --> 00:06:54.476
SD: So what's happening
is that the black hole is spinning.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.893
And you wind up with some of the gas
moving towards us below

00:06:57.917 --> 00:06:59.601
and receding from us on the top.

00:06:59.625 --> 00:07:02.101
And just as the train whistle
has a higher pitch

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:03.518
when it's coming towards you,

00:07:03.542 --> 00:07:07.309
there's more energy from the gas
coming towards us than going away from us.

00:07:07.333 --> 00:07:08.893
You see the bottom part brighter

00:07:08.917 --> 00:07:12.143
because the light is actually
being boosted in our direction.

00:07:12.167 --> 00:07:14.143
CA: And how physically big is that?

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:19.976
SD: Our entire solar system
would fit well within that dark region.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.976
And if I may,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.059
that dark region is the signature
of the event horizon.

00:07:26.083 --> 00:07:28.059
The reason we don't see light from there,

00:07:28.083 --> 00:07:30.684
is that the light that would come
to us from that place

00:07:30.708 --> 00:07:32.434
was swallowed by the event horizon.

00:07:32.458 --> 00:07:34.559
So that -- that's it.

00:07:34.583 --> 00:07:36.559
CA: And so when we think of a black hole,

00:07:36.583 --> 00:07:39.143
you think of these huge rays
jetting out of it,

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:41.268
which are pointed
directly in our direction.

00:07:41.292 --> 00:07:42.643
Why don't we see them?

00:07:42.667 --> 00:07:44.768
SD: This is a very powerful black hole.

00:07:44.792 --> 00:07:48.101
Not by universal standards,
it's still powerful,

00:07:48.125 --> 00:07:50.602
and from the north and south poles
of this black hole

00:07:50.626 --> 00:07:52.351
we think that jets are coming.

00:07:52.375 --> 00:07:55.976
Now, we're too close
to really see all the jet structure,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.684
but it's the base of those jets
that are illuminating the space-time.

00:07:59.708 --> 00:08:03.434
And that's what's being bent
around the black hole.

00:08:03.458 --> 00:08:07.226
CA: And if you were in a spaceship
whirling around that thing somehow,

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.726
how long would it take
to actually go around it?

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.476
SD: First, I would give anything
to be in that spaceship.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.393
(Laughter)

00:08:14.417 --> 00:08:15.708
Sign me up.

00:08:16.583 --> 00:08:19.809
There’s something called the --
if I can get wonky for one moment --

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:21.601
the innermost stable circular orbit,

00:08:21.625 --> 00:08:25.018
that's the innermost orbit at which
matter can move around a black hole

00:08:25.042 --> 00:08:26.434
before it spirals in.

00:08:26.458 --> 00:08:31.167
And for this black hole, it's going to be
between three days and about a month.

00:08:32.208 --> 00:08:35.934
CA: It's so powerful,
it's weirdly slow at one level.

00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:38.809
I mean, you wouldn't even notice

00:08:38.833 --> 00:08:42.643
falling into that event horizon
if you were there.

00:08:42.667 --> 00:08:44.976
SD: So you may have heard
of "spaghettification,"

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.558
where you fall into a black hole

00:08:46.582 --> 00:08:50.183
and the gravitational field on your feet
is much stronger than on your head,

00:08:50.207 --> 00:08:51.518
so you're ripped apart.

00:08:51.542 --> 00:08:53.976
This black hole is so big

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.351
that you're not going to become
a spaghetti noodle.

00:08:57.375 --> 00:09:00.226
You're just going to drift
right through that event horizon.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.059
CA: So, it's like a giant tornado.

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:05.601
When Dorothy was whipped by a tornado,
she ended up in Oz.

00:09:05.625 --> 00:09:07.976
Where do you end up
if you fall into a black hole?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.851
(Laughter)

00:09:09.875 --> 00:09:11.143
SD: Vancouver.

00:09:11.167 --> 00:09:13.101
(Laughter)

00:09:13.125 --> 00:09:14.393
CA: Oh, my God.

00:09:14.417 --> 00:09:16.559
(Applause)

00:09:16.583 --> 00:09:18.875
It's the red circle, that's terrifying.

00:09:20.292 --> 00:09:21.601
No, really.

00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:25.184
SD: Black holes really are
the central mystery of our age,

00:09:25.208 --> 00:09:29.018
because that's where the quantum world
and the gravitational world come together.

00:09:29.042 --> 00:09:30.643
What's inside is a singularity.

00:09:30.667 --> 00:09:33.059
And that's where
all the forces become unified,

00:09:33.083 --> 00:09:37.684
because gravity finally is strong enough
to compete with all the other forces.

00:09:37.708 --> 00:09:39.101
But it's hidden from us,

00:09:39.125 --> 00:09:43.184
the universe has cloaked it
in the ultimate invisibility cloak.

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:45.101
So we don't know what happens in there.

00:09:45.125 --> 00:09:47.768
CA: So there's a smaller one of these
in our own galaxy.

00:09:47.792 --> 00:09:49.934
Can we go back
to our own beautiful galaxy?

00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.726
This is the Milky Way, this is home.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.393
And somewhere in the middle of that
there's another one,

00:09:54.417 --> 00:09:56.184
which you're trying to find as well.

00:09:56.208 --> 00:09:59.351
SD: We already know it's there,
and we've already taken data on it.

00:09:59.375 --> 00:10:01.434
And we're working on those data right now.

00:10:01.458 --> 00:10:05.309
So we hope to have something
in the near future, I can't say when.

00:10:05.333 --> 00:10:07.601
CA: It's way closer
but also a lot smaller,

00:10:07.625 --> 00:10:09.893
maybe the similar kind of size
to what we saw?

00:10:09.917 --> 00:10:13.434
SD: Right. So it turns out
that the black hole in M87,

00:10:13.458 --> 00:10:14.726
that we saw before,

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.934
is six and a half billion solar masses.

00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:20.018
But it's so far away
that it appears a certain size.

00:10:20.042 --> 00:10:23.643
The black hole in the center of our galaxy
is a thousand times less massive,

00:10:23.667 --> 00:10:25.309
but also a thousand times closer.

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:29.018
So it looks the same
angular size on the sky.

00:10:29.042 --> 00:10:32.268
CA: Finally, I guess,
a nod to a remarkable group of people.

00:10:32.292 --> 00:10:33.851
Who are these guys?

00:10:33.875 --> 00:10:36.518
SD: So these are only some of the team.

00:10:36.542 --> 00:10:42.143
We marveled at the resonance
that this image has had.

00:10:42.167 --> 00:10:45.684
If you told me that it would be
above the fold in all of these newspapers,

00:10:45.708 --> 00:10:48.143
I'm not sure I would
have believed you, but it was.

00:10:48.167 --> 00:10:49.724
Because this is a great mystery,

00:10:49.738 --> 00:10:53.351
and it's inspiring for us,
and I hope it's inspiring to everyone.

00:10:53.375 --> 00:10:57.018
But the more important thing is that
this is just a small number of the team.

00:10:57.042 --> 00:10:59.934
We're 200 people strong with 60 institutes

00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:01.518
and 20 countries and regions.

00:11:01.542 --> 00:11:04.684
If you want to build a global telescope
you need a global team.

00:11:04.708 --> 00:11:08.643
And this technique that we use
of linking telescopes around the world

00:11:08.667 --> 00:11:13.226
kind of effortlessly sidesteps
some of the issues that divide us.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:16.958
And as scientists, we naturally
come together to do something like this.

00:11:17.833 --> 00:11:21.143
CA: Wow, boy, that's inspiring
for our whole team this week.

00:11:21.167 --> 00:11:24.025
Shep, thank you so much for what you did
and for coming here.

00:11:24.049 --> 00:11:25.309
SD: Thank you.

00:11:25.333 --> 00:11:28.667
(Applause)
