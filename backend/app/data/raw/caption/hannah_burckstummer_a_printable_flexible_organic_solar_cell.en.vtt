00:00:13.938 --> 00:00:16.705
You may have noticed
that I'm wearing two different shoes.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.390
It probably looks funny --

00:00:20.414 --> 00:00:22.136
it definitely feels funny --

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.840
but I wanted to make a point.

00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:28.884
Let's say my left shoe corresponds
to a sustainable footprint,

00:00:28.908 --> 00:00:32.106
meaning we humans consume
less natural resources

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.354
than our planet can regenerate,

00:00:34.378 --> 00:00:38.890
and emit less carbon dioxide
than our forests and oceans can reabsorb.

00:00:39.532 --> 00:00:41.568
That's a stable and healthy condition.

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:45.642
Today's situation
is more like my other shoe.

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:47.213
It's way oversized.

00:00:47.982 --> 00:00:51.161
At the second of August in 2017,

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:55.510
we had already consumed all resources
our planet can regenerate this year.

00:00:56.764 --> 00:01:00.275
This is like spending all your money
until the 18th of a month

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:03.577
and then needing a credit
from the bank for the rest of the time.

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:05.982
For sure, you can do this
for some months in a row,

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:07.902
but if you don't change your behavior,

00:01:07.926 --> 00:01:10.423
sooner or later,
you will run into big problems.

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:15.912
We all know the devastating effects
of this excessive exploitation:

00:01:15.936 --> 00:01:17.323
global warming,

00:01:17.347 --> 00:01:19.085
rising of the sea levels,

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:21.416
melting of the glaciers and polar ice,

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.865
increasingly extreme
climate patterns and more.

00:01:26.417 --> 00:01:29.079
The enormity of this problem
really frustrates me.

00:01:30.306 --> 00:01:33.649
What frustrates me even more
is that there are solutions to this,

00:01:33.673 --> 00:01:36.026
but we keep doing things
like we always did.

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:38.363
Today I want to share with you

00:01:38.387 --> 00:01:43.311
how a new solar technology can contribute
to a sustainable future of buildings.

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:48.761
Buildings consume about 40 percent
of our total energy demand,

00:01:48.785 --> 00:01:50.139
so tackling this consumption

00:01:50.163 --> 00:01:52.753
would significantly reduce
our climate emissions.

00:01:53.436 --> 00:01:55.755
A building designed
along sustainable principles

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:58.163
can produce all the power
it needs by itself.

00:01:58.814 --> 00:01:59.964
To achieve this,

00:01:59.988 --> 00:02:03.346
you first have to reduce
the consumption as much as possible,

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.263
by using well-insulated walls
or windows, for instance.

00:02:06.621 --> 00:02:08.819
These technologies
are commercially available.

00:02:09.828 --> 00:02:12.466
Then you need energy
for warm water and heating.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.810
You can get this
in a renewable way from the sun

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:17.648
through solar-thermal installations

00:02:17.672 --> 00:02:19.999
or from the ground and air,
with heat pumps.

00:02:20.023 --> 00:02:21.983
All of these technologies are available.

00:02:22.972 --> 00:02:25.323
Then you are left
with the need for electricity.

00:02:25.964 --> 00:02:29.860
In principle, there are several ways
to get renewable electricity,

00:02:29.884 --> 00:02:33.154
but how many buildings do you know
which have a windmill on the roof

00:02:33.178 --> 00:02:35.141
or a water power plant in the garden?

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.509
Probably not so many, because usually,
it doesn't make sense.

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:42.042
But the sun provides abundant energy
to our roofs and facades.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.840
The potential to harvest this energy
at our buildings' surfaces is enormous.

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:50.502
Let's take Europe as an example.

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:55.460
If you would utilize all areas
which have a nice orientation to the sun

00:02:55.484 --> 00:02:57.167
and they're not overly shaded,

00:02:57.191 --> 00:03:00.226
the power generated by photovoltaics

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.715
would correspond to about 30 percent
of our total energy demand.

00:03:04.303 --> 00:03:06.871
But today's photovoltaics
have some issues.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.180
They do offer a good
cost-performance ratio,

00:03:10.204 --> 00:03:12.872
but they aren't really flexible
in terms of their design,

00:03:12.896 --> 00:03:14.719
and this makes aesthetics a challenge.

00:03:15.123 --> 00:03:17.575
People often imagine pictures like this

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.032
when thinking about
solar cells on buildings.

00:03:20.056 --> 00:03:21.962
This may work for solar farms,

00:03:21.986 --> 00:03:25.390
but when you think of buildings,
of streets, of architecture,

00:03:25.414 --> 00:03:26.836
aesthetics does matter.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.543
This is the reason why we don't see
many solar cells on buildings today.

00:03:31.567 --> 00:03:32.892
They just don't match.

00:03:33.765 --> 00:03:38.073
Our team is working on a totally
different solar-cell technology,

00:03:38.097 --> 00:03:41.571
which is called
organic photovoltaics or OPV.

00:03:41.595 --> 00:03:43.432
The term organic describes

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:47.306
that the material used
for light absorption and charge transport

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.424
are mainly based on the element carbon,

00:03:49.448 --> 00:03:50.643
and not on metals.

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:54.053
We utilize the mixture of a polymer

00:03:54.077 --> 00:03:56.636
which is set up by different
repeating units,

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.690
like the pearls in a pearl chain,

00:03:58.714 --> 00:04:01.690
and a small molecule
which has the shape of a football

00:04:01.714 --> 00:04:03.059
and is called fullerene.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.781
These two compounds are mixed
and dissolved to become an ink.

00:04:08.413 --> 00:04:09.570
And like ink,

00:04:09.594 --> 00:04:14.020
they can be printed with simple
printing techniques like slot-die coating

00:04:14.044 --> 00:04:17.855
in a continuous roll-to-roll process
on flexible substrates.

00:04:18.855 --> 00:04:21.220
The resulting thin layer
is the active layer,

00:04:21.244 --> 00:04:23.077
absorbing the energy of the sun.

00:04:23.905 --> 00:04:26.481
This active layer is extremely effective.

00:04:27.522 --> 00:04:30.927
You only need a layer thickness
of 0.2 micrometers

00:04:30.951 --> 00:04:32.713
to absorb the energy of the sun.

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.767
This is 100 times thinner
than a human hair.

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:38.845
To give you another example,

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:41.566
take one kilogram of the basic polymer

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.801
and use it to formulate the active ink.

00:04:44.502 --> 00:04:45.911
With this amount of ink,

00:04:45.935 --> 00:04:49.941
you can print a solar cell
the size of a complete football field.

00:04:51.114 --> 00:04:54.798
So OPV is extremely material efficient,

00:04:54.822 --> 00:04:58.112
which I think is a crucial thing
when talking about sustainability.

00:04:59.354 --> 00:05:01.235
After the printing process,

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.980
you can have a solar module
which could look like this ...

00:05:04.988 --> 00:05:07.011
It looks a bit like a plastic foil

00:05:07.035 --> 00:05:08.915
and actually has many of its features.

00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:10.775
It's lightweight ...

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:13.628
it's bendable ...

00:05:14.458 --> 00:05:16.181
and it's semi-transparent.

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.329
But it can harvest the energy
of the sun outdoors

00:05:21.353 --> 00:05:22.824
and also of this indoor light,

00:05:22.848 --> 00:05:25.714
as you can see with this small,
illuminated LED.

00:05:26.872 --> 00:05:28.780
You can use it in its plastic form

00:05:28.804 --> 00:05:31.870
and take advantage of its low weight
and its bendability.

00:05:32.938 --> 00:05:36.557
The first is important when thinking
about buildings in warmer regions.

00:05:37.325 --> 00:05:40.957
Here, the roofs are not designed
to bear additionally heavy loads.

00:05:40.981 --> 00:05:43.631
They aren't designed
for snow in winter, for instance,

00:05:43.655 --> 00:05:47.823
so heavy silicon solar cells
cannot be used for light harvesting,

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.856
but these lightweight solar foils
are very well suited.

00:05:52.067 --> 00:05:54.521
The bendability is important

00:05:54.545 --> 00:05:58.122
if you want to combine the solar cell
with membrane architecture.

00:05:58.802 --> 00:06:02.383
Imagine the sails
of the Sydney Opera as power plants.

00:06:02.932 --> 00:06:05.258
Alternatively, you can
combine the solar foils

00:06:05.282 --> 00:06:07.823
with conventional construction
materials like glass.

00:06:08.458 --> 00:06:10.849
Many glass facade elements
contain a foil anyway,

00:06:10.873 --> 00:06:12.566
to create laminated safety glass.

00:06:13.148 --> 00:06:16.667
It's not a big deal to add
a second foil in the production process,

00:06:16.691 --> 00:06:19.603
but then the facade element
contains the solar cell

00:06:19.627 --> 00:06:21.489
and can produce electricity.

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:24.749
Besides looking nice,

00:06:24.773 --> 00:06:28.950
these integrated solar cells come along
with two more important benefits.

00:06:29.595 --> 00:06:33.298
Do you remember the solar cell
attached to a roof I showed before?

00:06:33.322 --> 00:06:35.991
In this case, we install the roof first,

00:06:36.015 --> 00:06:37.907
and as a second layer, the solar cell.

00:06:37.931 --> 00:06:39.931
This is adding on the installation costs.

00:06:40.508 --> 00:06:42.644
In the case of integrated solar cells,

00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:46.117
at the site of construction,
only one element is installed,

00:06:46.141 --> 00:06:48.602
being at the same time
the envelope of the building

00:06:48.626 --> 00:06:49.776
and the solar cell.

00:06:50.799 --> 00:06:52.829
Besides saving on the installation costs,

00:06:52.853 --> 00:06:54.775
this also saves resources,

00:06:54.799 --> 00:06:58.223
because the two functions
are combined into one element.

00:06:58.247 --> 00:07:00.144
Earlier, I've talked about optics.

00:07:00.168 --> 00:07:01.945
I really like this solar panel --

00:07:02.366 --> 00:07:05.287
maybe you have different taste
or different design needs ...

00:07:06.167 --> 00:07:07.318
No problem.

00:07:07.342 --> 00:07:08.606
With the printing process,

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.905
the solar cell can change
its shape and design very easily.

00:07:13.574 --> 00:07:16.088
This will give the flexibility
to architects,

00:07:16.112 --> 00:07:18.024
to planners and building owners,

00:07:18.048 --> 00:07:21.721
to integrate this electricity-producing
technology as they wish.

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:30.595
I want to stress that this is not
just happening in the labs.

00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:33.367
It will take several more years
to get to mass adoption,

00:07:33.391 --> 00:07:35.631
but we are at the edge
of commercialization,

00:07:36.662 --> 00:07:39.970
meaning there are several companies
out there with production lines.

00:07:40.561 --> 00:07:42.417
They are scaling up their capacities,

00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:44.128
and so are we, with the inks.

00:07:48.613 --> 00:07:49.763
(Shoe drops)

00:07:53.004 --> 00:07:55.554
This smaller footprint
is much more comfortable.

00:07:55.578 --> 00:07:57.046
(Laughter)

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.585
It is the right size, the right scale.

00:08:00.032 --> 00:08:03.998
We have to come back to the right scale
when it comes to energy consumption.

00:08:04.535 --> 00:08:07.618
And making buildings carbon-neutral
is an important part here.

00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:09.482
In Europe,

00:08:09.506 --> 00:08:12.593
we have the goal to decarbonize
our building stock [by] 2050.

00:08:13.324 --> 00:08:16.596
I hope organic photovoltaics
will be a big part of this.

00:08:17.882 --> 00:08:19.588
Here are a couple of examples.

00:08:20.123 --> 00:08:24.570
This is the first commercial installation
of fully printed organic solar cells.

00:08:25.276 --> 00:08:29.029
"Commercial" means that the solar cells
were printed on industrial equipment.

00:08:29.903 --> 00:08:33.289
The so-called "solar trees"
were part of the German pavilion

00:08:33.313 --> 00:08:35.713
at the World Expo in Milan in 2015.

00:08:36.532 --> 00:08:38.662
They provided shading during the day

00:08:38.686 --> 00:08:40.957
and electricity
for the lighting in the evening.

00:08:41.716 --> 00:08:45.272
You may wonder why this hexagonal shape
was chosen for the solar cells.

00:08:45.744 --> 00:08:46.956
Easy answer:

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.314
the architects wanted to have
a specific shading pattern on the floor

00:08:50.338 --> 00:08:51.604
and asked for it,

00:08:51.628 --> 00:08:53.495
and then it was printed as requested.

00:08:54.276 --> 00:08:55.927
Being far from a real product,

00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:59.689
this free-form installation hooked
the imagination of the visiting architects

00:08:59.713 --> 00:09:01.186
much more than we expected.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.772
This other application
is closer to the projects

00:09:04.796 --> 00:09:06.917
and applications we are targeting.

00:09:06.941 --> 00:09:09.826
In an office building
in São Paulo, Brazil,

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:13.595
semitransparent OPV panels
are integrated into the glass facade,

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:14.892
serving different needs.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.798
First, they provided shading
for the meeting rooms behind.

00:09:19.479 --> 00:09:24.199
Second, the logo of the company
is displayed in an innovative way.

00:09:24.644 --> 00:09:26.533
And of course, electricity is produced,

00:09:26.557 --> 00:09:28.880
reducing the energy footprint
of the building.

00:09:29.552 --> 00:09:31.398
This is pointing towards a future

00:09:31.422 --> 00:09:33.869
where buildings are no longer
energy consumers,

00:09:33.893 --> 00:09:35.309
but energy providers.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.899
I want to see solar cells
seamlessly integrated

00:09:38.923 --> 00:09:40.802
into our building shells

00:09:40.826 --> 00:09:43.878
to be both resource-efficient
and a pleasure to look at.

00:09:44.612 --> 00:09:48.725
For roofs, silicon solar cells
will often continue to be a good solution.

00:09:49.112 --> 00:09:53.628
But to exploit the potential
of all facades and other areas,

00:09:53.652 --> 00:09:55.936
such as semitransparent areas,

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.548
curved surfaces and shadings,

00:09:58.572 --> 00:10:03.581
I believe organic photovoltaics
can offer a significant contribution,

00:10:03.605 --> 00:10:08.809
and they can be made in any form
architects and planners will want them to.

00:10:09.425 --> 00:10:10.576
Thank you.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.015
(Applause)
