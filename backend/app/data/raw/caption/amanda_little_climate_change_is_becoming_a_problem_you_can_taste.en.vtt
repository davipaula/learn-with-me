00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.643
In the early months of the pandemic,

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:17.059
chef José Andrés circulated two photos

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:21.309
that have come to symbolize
a modern American food crisis.

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.434
The first shows mountains of potatoes

00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:25.934
that have been left to rot
in a field in Idaho.

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:29.684
The restaurants and cafeterias
and stadiums that had consumed them

00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:31.976
were shuttered during the pandemic.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.184
The second shows a devastating scene
outside of the San Antonio food bank.

00:00:36.208 --> 00:00:38.976
Thousands of carloads of people lined up,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.351
waiting for food with not enough
supply to go around.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:46.809
"How is it possible these two photos
exist at the same time,

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:48.101
in the most prosperous

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:52.393
and technologically advanced
moment in our history," tweeted Andrés.

00:00:52.417 --> 00:00:55.559
In the months after
the photos were published,

00:00:55.583 --> 00:00:57.292
the crisis got worse.

00:00:58.208 --> 00:01:01.309
Billions of pounds of potatoes
and other fresh produce

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.809
were chucked by American farmers.

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:05.101
At the same time,

00:01:05.125 --> 00:01:08.078
food banks all over the country
were reporting demand increases

00:01:08.102 --> 00:01:11.768
and 40 percent were facing
critical shortfalls.

00:01:11.792 --> 00:01:13.393
Outside the US,

00:01:13.417 --> 00:01:17.184
especially in the Middle East
and throughout Southeastern Africa,

00:01:17.208 --> 00:01:21.809
COVID-19 was paralyzing food systems
that were already vulnerable.

00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:25.684
Oxfam has predicted
that by the end of 2020

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:30.684
12,000 people per day could die
of hunger related to COVID.

00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:33.309
That's more than the highest
daily mortality rate

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:35.059
recorded so far.

00:01:35.083 --> 00:01:36.351
But what's worse

00:01:36.375 --> 00:01:38.934
and what's much more
concerning to all of us

00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:42.226
is that COVID is just one
of many major disruptions

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.809
that have been predicted

00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:46.643
in the years and decades ahead.

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:50.768
More chronic and complex
than the pressures of COVID

00:01:50.792 --> 00:01:52.726
are the pressures of climate change.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.934
And those of you who live in California
have seen this on your farms.

00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.476
You've seen withering heat
and drought and fires

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.059
disrupt avocado and almond
and citrus and strawberry farms.

00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:09.309
This summer, we saw
the devastating impacts of storms

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:11.893
on corn and soy farms.

00:02:11.917 --> 00:02:14.518
I've seen the various
pressures of drought,

00:02:14.542 --> 00:02:17.018
heat, flooding, superstorms,

00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:19.601
invasive insects, bacterial blight,

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:22.101
shifting seasons and weather volatility

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:24.184
from Washington to Florida,

00:02:24.208 --> 00:02:27.393
and from Guatemala to Australia.

00:02:27.417 --> 00:02:29.184
The upshot is this.

00:02:29.208 --> 00:02:31.893
Climate change is becoming
something we can taste.

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:35.101
This is a kitchen-table issue
in the literal sense.

00:02:35.125 --> 00:02:37.101
The International Panel on Climate Change

00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:39.476
has predicted that by mid-century

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.476
the world may reach a threshold
of global warming

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.309
beyond which current
agricultural practices

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:49.434
can no longer support
large human civilizations.

00:02:49.458 --> 00:02:53.601
The USDA scientist Jerry Hatfield
put it to me this way:

00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:55.643
the single biggest threat
of climate change

00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:58.309
is the collapse of food systems.

00:02:58.333 --> 00:03:00.059
The reality we face,

00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:02.809
one that was exposed
by those mountains of potatoes

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:05.268
and the cars lined up during the pandemic,

00:03:05.292 --> 00:03:09.393
is that our supply chains are antiquated.

00:03:09.417 --> 00:03:11.643
Our food systems have not been designed

00:03:11.667 --> 00:03:16.268
to adapt to major disruptions
or preempt them.

00:03:16.292 --> 00:03:19.851
Addressing this challenge
as much as any other

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:23.434
is going to define our progress
in the coming century.

00:03:23.458 --> 00:03:25.059
But there's good news.

00:03:25.083 --> 00:03:29.351
And the good news is that farmers
and entrepreneurs and academics

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:33.226
are radically rethinking
national and global food systems.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.434
They are marrying principles
of old-world agroecology

00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:38.309
and state-of-the-art technologies

00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:42.125
to create what I call
a third way to our food future.

00:03:43.083 --> 00:03:44.809
We're going to see radical changes

00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:48.059
in what we grow and how we eat
in the coming decades,

00:03:48.083 --> 00:03:50.393
as these environmental and population

00:03:50.417 --> 00:03:53.143
and public health pressures intensify.

00:03:53.167 --> 00:03:55.851
I studied these changes
for my book "The Fate of Food:

00:03:55.875 --> 00:03:58.893
What We'll Eat in a Bigger,
Hotter, Smarter World."

00:03:58.917 --> 00:04:01.684
I traveled for five years
into the lands and the minds

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:04.893
and the machines that are shaping
the future of food.

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:09.143
My travels took me
through 15 countries and 18 states,

00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:14.059
from apple orchards in Wisconsin
to tiny cornfields in Kenya,

00:04:14.083 --> 00:04:15.976
to massive Norwegian fish farms

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.976
and computerized foodscapes in Shanghai.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.726
I investigated new ideas,

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.393
like robotics and CRISPR
and vertical farms.

00:04:24.417 --> 00:04:29.684
And old ideas, like edible insects
and permaculture and ancient plants.

00:04:29.708 --> 00:04:33.809
I began to see the emergence
of this third way to food production.

00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:38.143
A synthesis of the traditional
and the radically new.

00:04:38.167 --> 00:04:40.018
There's a growing controversy

00:04:40.042 --> 00:04:43.851
about the best path
to future food security in the US.

00:04:43.875 --> 00:04:47.643
Food is ripe for reinvention,
Bill Gates has proclaimed.

00:04:47.667 --> 00:04:49.393
Huge flows of investment

00:04:49.417 --> 00:04:54.684
are funding new methods of climate-smart
and high-tech agriculture.

00:04:54.708 --> 00:04:58.934
But many sustainable food advocates
bristle at this idea of reinvention.

00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.934
They want food deinvented.

00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:03.976
They argue for a return to preindustrial

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.434
and pre-green revolution,

00:05:06.458 --> 00:05:09.393
biodynamic and organic farming.

00:05:09.417 --> 00:05:11.851
To which skeptics inevitably respond,

00:05:11.875 --> 00:05:13.934
"Nice, but does it scale?

00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.351
Sure, a return to traditional
farming methods

00:05:16.375 --> 00:05:17.809
could produce better food,

00:05:17.833 --> 00:05:20.559
but can it produce enough food
that's affordable?"

00:05:20.583 --> 00:05:23.518
The rift between the reinvention camp
and the deinvention camp

00:05:23.542 --> 00:05:25.268
has existed for decades.

00:05:25.292 --> 00:05:29.184
But now it's a raging battle.

00:05:29.208 --> 00:05:30.643
One side covets the past,

00:05:30.667 --> 00:05:32.518
the other side covets the future

00:05:32.542 --> 00:05:35.059
and as someone observing this
from the outside,

00:05:35.083 --> 00:05:38.268
I began to wonder,
why must it be so binary?

00:05:38.292 --> 00:05:41.101
Can't there be a synthesis
of the two approaches?

00:05:41.125 --> 00:05:45.809
Our challenge is to borrow
from the wisdom of the ages,

00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:48.601
and from our most advanced science,

00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:51.184
to forge this third way.

00:05:51.208 --> 00:05:54.559
One that allows us
to improve and scale our harvests,

00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:56.726
while restoring rather than degrading

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.643
the underlying web of life.

00:05:59.667 --> 00:06:02.018
I belong to neither camp.

00:06:02.042 --> 00:06:04.893
I'm a failed vegan
and a lapsed vegetarian,

00:06:04.917 --> 00:06:06.934
and a terrible backyard farmer.

00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.226
If I'm honest,

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.875
I will keep trying at this,
but I may fail.

00:06:11.708 --> 00:06:13.018
But I'm hell-bent on hope,

00:06:13.042 --> 00:06:15.434
and if my travels have taught me anything,

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.976
it's that there's good reason for hope.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.518
Plenty of solutions are merging

00:06:19.542 --> 00:06:22.309
that can help build sustainable,
resilient food systems.

00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:24.809
Even if we can't rely on a critical mass

00:06:24.833 --> 00:06:28.101
of backyard-farming vegetarians
to do this on their own,

00:06:28.125 --> 00:06:29.458
from the ground up.

00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:33.518
Let's start with artificial
intelligence and robotics.

00:06:33.542 --> 00:06:36.768
Jorge Heraud is a Peruvian-born engineer

00:06:36.792 --> 00:06:38.476
who now lives in Silicon Valley,

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.851
and his company developed
a robotic weeder named See and Spray,

00:06:42.875 --> 00:06:47.018
and I went to Arkansas to see
the maiden voyage of See and Spray.

00:06:47.042 --> 00:06:51.059
And I was half expecting
a battalion of C3PO-style robots

00:06:51.083 --> 00:06:54.976
to march into the fields
with pincer hands to pluck the weeds.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.684
And instead, I found this.

00:06:56.708 --> 00:07:00.268
A tractor with a big, white
hoop skirt off the back of it.

00:07:00.292 --> 00:07:02.768
And inside that hoop skirt are 24 cameras

00:07:02.792 --> 00:07:06.518
that use computer vision
to see the ground beneath

00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:09.143
and to distinguish between
the plants and the weeds.

00:07:09.167 --> 00:07:11.809
And to deploy with sniper-like precision

00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:14.726
these tiny jets
of concentrated fertilizer,

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.143
or herbicide,

00:07:16.167 --> 00:07:18.768
that incinerate the baby weeds.

00:07:18.792 --> 00:07:21.351
I learned how robotics
can end the practice

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:25.393
of broadcast spraying chemicals
across millions of acres of land

00:07:25.417 --> 00:07:28.226
and how we can reduce
the use of herbicides

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.351
by up to 90 percent.

00:07:30.375 --> 00:07:32.976
But the bigger picture
is even more exciting.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.309
Intelligent machines
can treat plants individually,

00:07:36.333 --> 00:07:37.851
applying not just herbicides

00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:39.893
but fungicides and insecticides

00:07:39.917 --> 00:07:45.101
and fertilizers on a plant-by-plant,
rather than field-by-field basis.

00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:46.768
So that eventually,

00:07:46.792 --> 00:07:49.518
this kind of hyperspecific farming

00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:53.226
can allow for more diversity
and intercropping on fields.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:57.601
And big farms can begin
to mimic natural systems

00:07:57.625 --> 00:07:59.643
and improve soil health.

00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:03.601
Heraud is the embodiment
of third-way thinking, right?

00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:05.351
Robots, he told me,

00:08:05.375 --> 00:08:07.101
don't have to remove us from nature,

00:08:07.125 --> 00:08:09.833
they can bring us closer to it,
they can restore it.

00:08:10.792 --> 00:08:13.518
Increasing crop diversity will be crucial

00:08:13.542 --> 00:08:16.184
to building resilient food systems.

00:08:16.208 --> 00:08:18.976
And so will decentralizing agriculture

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.393
so that when farmers
in one region are disrupted,

00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:23.559
the others around, they can keep growing.

00:08:23.583 --> 00:08:25.101
The rise of vertical farms,

00:08:25.125 --> 00:08:31.018
like this farm, built inside
a former steel mill in Newark, New Jersey,

00:08:31.042 --> 00:08:34.976
can play a key role
in decentralizing agriculture.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.476
Aeroponic farms use a tiny fraction

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.268
of the water that is used
in in-ground farms.

00:08:41.292 --> 00:08:45.101
And they can grow food much faster,
about 40 percent faster.

00:08:45.125 --> 00:08:47.059
And when located in and near cities,

00:08:47.083 --> 00:08:48.393
where the food is consumed,

00:08:48.417 --> 00:08:52.101
they eliminate a huge amount
of trucking and food waste.

00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:54.393
It struck me at first as creepy

00:08:54.417 --> 00:08:56.059
in kind of a "Silent Running" way

00:08:56.083 --> 00:08:59.518
that we'd be growing
our future fruits and vegetables

00:08:59.542 --> 00:09:03.184
inside, without soil or sun.

00:09:03.208 --> 00:09:06.351
And after weeks of spending time
in these plant factories,

00:09:06.375 --> 00:09:10.309
I began to see it as oddly,
almost perfectly natural

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:13.643
to deliver the plants
only and exactly what they need,

00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:16.518
with zero herbicides
and radical efficiency.

00:09:16.542 --> 00:09:19.934
Here again, we see innovators
borrowing from,

00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:24.434
and perhaps even elevating
the wisdom of natural ecosystems.

00:09:24.458 --> 00:09:27.893
Developments in plant-based
and alternative meats

00:09:27.917 --> 00:09:29.809
are also profoundly hopeful.

00:09:29.833 --> 00:09:31.476
And they follow a similar trend

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.559
toward local, resilient,
low-carbon protein production.

00:09:36.583 --> 00:09:38.184
Consumers are excited about this,

00:09:38.208 --> 00:09:39.476
and during the pandemic,

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.518
we've seen a 250 percent increase

00:09:41.542 --> 00:09:44.101
in demand for alternative meats.

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:46.934
A study by the Journal
of Clinical Nutrition

00:09:46.958 --> 00:09:52.726
found that the participants
who were eating the plant-based proteins

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.518
saw a drop in their cholesterol levels,

00:09:55.542 --> 00:09:56.809
in their weight

00:09:56.833 --> 00:10:00.351
and eventually, a drop
in their risk of heart disease.

00:10:00.375 --> 00:10:04.434
The potential environmental benefits
of plant-based meats are astounding.

00:10:04.458 --> 00:10:08.768
And there's even potential
in lab-grown or cell-based meats.

00:10:08.792 --> 00:10:13.184
Uma Valeti fed me my first plate
of lab-grown duck breast,

00:10:13.208 --> 00:10:16.268
harvested fresh from a bioreactor.

00:10:16.292 --> 00:10:18.851
It had been grown
from a small sampling of cells

00:10:18.875 --> 00:10:23.184
taken from muscle tissue and fat
and connective tissues,

00:10:23.208 --> 00:10:25.976
which is exactly what we eat
when we eat meat.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.768
This lab-grown or cell-based duck meat

00:10:28.792 --> 00:10:31.893
has very little threat
of bacterial contamination,

00:10:31.917 --> 00:10:35.684
it's about 85 percent lower CO2
emissions associated with it.

00:10:35.708 --> 00:10:37.809
Eventually it can be grown

00:10:37.833 --> 00:10:42.476
like those crops inside vertical farms
in decentralized facilities

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.684
that aren't vulnerable
to supply-chain disruptions.

00:10:45.708 --> 00:10:47.726
Valeti started out as a cardiologist,

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:52.184
who understood that doctors
have been developing

00:10:52.208 --> 00:10:55.934
human and animal tissues
in laboratories for decades.

00:10:55.958 --> 00:10:58.268
He was inspired as much by that

00:10:58.292 --> 00:11:02.851
as he was by a 1931 quote
from Winston Churchill that says,

00:11:02.875 --> 00:11:05.768
"We shall escape the absurdity
of growing the whole chicken

00:11:05.792 --> 00:11:08.018
in order to eat the breast or the wing,

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:12.393
by growing them separately
in suitable mediums."

00:11:12.417 --> 00:11:16.351
Like Heraud, Valeti is
a quintessential third-way thinker.

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:20.143
He's reimagined an old idea
using new technology,

00:11:20.167 --> 00:11:24.184
to usher in a solution
whose time has come.

00:11:24.208 --> 00:11:29.226
I've met with dozens of farmers
and entrepreneurs and engineers

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.101
who emulate third-way thinking,
all over the world.

00:11:32.125 --> 00:11:35.268
They're using modern
breeding tools like CRISPR

00:11:35.292 --> 00:11:39.559
to develop nutritious heirloom crops
that can withstand drought and heat.

00:11:39.583 --> 00:11:43.768
They're using AI to make
aquaculture sustainable.

00:11:43.792 --> 00:11:46.476
They're finding ways
to eliminate food waste.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.768
They are scaling up

00:11:47.792 --> 00:11:50.434
conservation agriculture
and managed grazing.

00:11:50.458 --> 00:11:52.226
And they're reviving ancient plants,

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.934
and they're recycling
sewage and gray water

00:11:54.958 --> 00:11:57.625
to develop a drought-proof water supply.

00:11:58.625 --> 00:12:00.351
The upshot is this:

00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:05.434
Human innovation that marries
old and new approaches to food production

00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:09.393
can, and I believe, will
usher in this third way

00:12:09.417 --> 00:12:13.125
and redefine sustainable food
on a grand scale.
