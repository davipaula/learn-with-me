00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.800
(Music)

00:00:35.298 --> 00:00:39.655
(Singing) Ooh ooh

00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:45.710
She wants to be rich

00:00:46.552 --> 00:00:49.123
She wants to be famous

00:00:49.147 --> 00:00:52.136
She wants to have lots and lots of money

00:00:52.496 --> 00:00:54.268
Soar above the clouds

00:00:54.292 --> 00:00:56.075
She wanna be free

00:00:56.688 --> 00:00:59.506
Like Nelson Mandela

00:00:59.942 --> 00:01:01.847
Stand tall like a pyramid

00:01:01.871 --> 00:01:04.143
So, so courageous

00:01:04.911 --> 00:01:07.466
No place she'd rather be

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.704
Oh na na na, oh na na na

00:01:09.728 --> 00:01:12.128
And there's no place she'd rather be

00:01:12.465 --> 00:01:13.735
Oh na na na, oh na na na

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.815
Live and die in Afrika

00:01:17.997 --> 00:01:21.142
She wanna live and die in Afrika

00:01:21.878 --> 00:01:23.412
Oh lo lo lo lo

00:01:23.436 --> 00:01:26.666
Live and die in Afrika

00:01:28.546 --> 00:01:31.614
Live and die in Afrika

00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:36.498
I wanna feel love

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:39.677
I wanna be remembered

00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:42.336
I wanna go down in history

00:01:42.985 --> 00:01:44.712
And make my mama proud

00:01:44.736 --> 00:01:46.585
The darker the berry

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.997
The sweeter the juice

00:01:50.432 --> 00:01:54.464
Na sitoki nyumbani wacha mila ni mtumwa

00:01:55.458 --> 00:01:58.131
No place I'd rather go

00:01:58.155 --> 00:02:00.514
Oh na na na, oh na na na

00:02:00.538 --> 00:02:03.604
No place I'd rather go
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

00:02:03.934 --> 00:02:06.981
Live and die in Afrika

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:08.489
Oh lo lo lo lo lo lo

00:02:09.027 --> 00:02:11.439
Live and die in Afrika

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.051
Oh yeah yeah

00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:17.062
Live and die in Afrika

00:02:18.976 --> 00:02:23.412
Live and die in Afrika

00:02:24.215 --> 00:02:28.701
Live and die in Afrika

00:02:28.725 --> 00:02:32.633
(Applause)

00:02:32.657 --> 00:02:35.276
Bien-Aimé Baraza: Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.315
It's a pleasure and honor
to be here today.

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:39.276
Onstage is the group called Sauti Sol.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.093
(Cheering)

00:02:41.117 --> 00:02:44.601
We have a couple of people paid
in the audience to make some noise for us.

00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:45.783
(Laughter)

00:02:45.807 --> 00:02:49.569
The four of us met
in high school, 15 years ago,

00:02:49.593 --> 00:02:52.546
and at the time, we were famous
for singing Boyz II Men covers,

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.315
because they were our biggest inspiration.

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:56.338
(Laughter)

00:02:56.362 --> 00:03:00.379
And I remember, in a very pervy way,
in my room, I had a Mariah Carey poster

00:03:00.403 --> 00:03:02.604
and a Britney Spears poster, too.

00:03:02.628 --> 00:03:03.700
(Laughter)

00:03:03.724 --> 00:03:07.672
And I can't help but feel
that times have changed.

00:03:07.696 --> 00:03:11.283
Because what used to be
Mariah Carey in my room now,

00:03:11.307 --> 00:03:14.981
in a 15-year-old boy's room,
is Tiwa Savage.

00:03:15.005 --> 00:03:20.077
What used to be 50 Cent in my room then,

00:03:20.101 --> 00:03:22.641
to a 15-year-old boy's room now

00:03:22.665 --> 00:03:23.815
is Sauti Sol.

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:26.823
(Cheering) (Applause)

00:03:26.847 --> 00:03:30.895
The role of Afrobeats in emancipating

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:36.998
and getting over the colonial
mindset of the youth

00:03:37.022 --> 00:03:38.222
cannot be ignored.

00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:43.141
Afrobeats has played the strongest
role so far, if you ask me,

00:03:43.165 --> 00:03:46.298
as far as emancipating
the youth is concerned.

00:03:47.046 --> 00:03:52.251
We are now the superstars
of our generation, for our people.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.822
We are the solution
to their musical problems.

00:03:55.846 --> 00:03:57.005
(Applause)

00:03:57.029 --> 00:04:00.926
And people our age are no longer
looking for entertainment

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.251
from America, from the West.

00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:05.180
We are the entertainment,

00:04:05.204 --> 00:04:09.309
and they're priming us above
any other form of art.

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:14.101
In 2015, President Obama came to Kenya,

00:04:14.125 --> 00:04:17.089
and we had the pleasure
of being the entertainment

00:04:17.113 --> 00:04:19.942
for the state dinner that happened
at state house, Nairobi.

00:04:20.244 --> 00:04:22.212
And as we were performing,

00:04:22.236 --> 00:04:27.037
he jumped onstage with us,
and together, we did a cultural dance

00:04:27.061 --> 00:04:31.093
to a song that I want to share
with you guys right now.

00:04:31.427 --> 00:04:35.093
And wherever you are,
if you feel the music, dance.

00:04:35.117 --> 00:04:37.260
Ladies and gentleman, "Sura Yako."

00:04:37.284 --> 00:04:38.442
(Cheering)

00:04:38.466 --> 00:04:39.616
(Music)

00:04:40.442 --> 00:04:45.047
Nimekuchagua wewe, nikupende

00:04:45.408 --> 00:04:48.325
Mama, sitaki mwingine

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:53.399
Aushi usiniache, usinitende

00:04:53.423 --> 00:04:57.128
Mama, usipende mwingine

00:04:57.812 --> 00:04:59.669
Moyo wangu ni mwepesi

00:04:59.693 --> 00:05:01.584
Umenikalia chapati

00:05:01.608 --> 00:05:03.653
Nafanya vituko kama chizi

00:05:03.677 --> 00:05:05.561
Kukupenda sitasizi

00:05:05.585 --> 00:05:07.672
Moyo wangu ni mwepesi

00:05:07.696 --> 00:05:09.403
Umenikalia chapati

00:05:09.427 --> 00:05:11.785
Nafanya vituko kama chizi

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:13.498
Kukupenda sitasizi

00:05:13.522 --> 00:05:16.283

You're so, so beautiful

00:06:22.442 --> 00:06:25.021
Mzuri mama

00:06:26.244 --> 00:06:27.931
Mzuri mama

00:06:28.307 --> 00:06:29.557
Mzuri mama

00:06:29.581 --> 00:06:31.596
You're so, so

00:06:34.303 --> 00:06:36.060
Mzuri mama

00:06:36.458 --> 00:06:38.327
Mzuri mama

00:06:38.351 --> 00:06:40.361
Mzuri mama

00:06:42.507 --> 00:06:44.086
Mzuri mama

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:45.856
Mzuri mama

00:06:46.515 --> 00:06:48.130
Mzuri mama

00:06:50.404 --> 00:06:51.971
Mzuri mama

00:06:52.442 --> 00:06:53.902
Mzuri mama

00:06:54.402 --> 00:06:56.703
Mzuri mama

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.172
Mzuri mama

00:07:00.196 --> 00:07:02.926
Mzuri mama

00:07:05.627 --> 00:07:08.116
(Applause)

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.600
Savara Mudigi: Wow.

00:07:09.624 --> 00:07:11.558
Thank you, thank you so much.

00:07:11.582 --> 00:07:13.060
(Applause)

00:07:13.084 --> 00:07:16.909
So, afrobeats, afrobeats.

00:07:16.933 --> 00:07:20.612
Afrobeat is a force,
it's a force in the world right now.

00:07:21.013 --> 00:07:23.577
Just last year, in the last year alone,

00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:26.727
Africa had songs in the Billboard charts.

00:07:27.038 --> 00:07:31.638
"One Dance," written by Wizkid,
performed by Wizkid and Drake.

00:07:32.093 --> 00:07:34.553
"Unforgettable" by French Montana.

00:07:34.577 --> 00:07:38.244
For those who know or don't know,
French Montana is Moroccan.

00:07:38.561 --> 00:07:42.775
Artists who the world
has normally considered as mainstream

00:07:42.799 --> 00:07:45.450
are now realizing
they're late to the party.

00:07:45.474 --> 00:07:47.403
And they are knocking on the door,

00:07:47.427 --> 00:07:50.276
and because we are good people,
we are going to let them in.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.759
(Laughter)

00:07:51.783 --> 00:07:53.879
(Applause)

00:07:53.903 --> 00:07:57.561
When we look at an artist,
Queen B herself -- in brackets, Beyoncé --

00:07:57.585 --> 00:07:58.744
(Laughter)

00:07:58.768 --> 00:08:02.664
Beyoncé has African
influence in her music.

00:08:02.688 --> 00:08:04.855
A couple of years ago, in 2011,

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:08.466
through YouTube, she saw
these dancers called Tofo Tofo dancers,

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:09.752
from Mozambique,

00:08:09.776 --> 00:08:14.466
and she flew them all the way
from Mozambique to Los Angeles

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.656
to teach her and her dancers

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.280
the now signature dance moves
that you see in her song,

00:08:19.304 --> 00:08:21.045
"Run the World (Girls)."

00:08:21.069 --> 00:08:22.755
Yeah. (Laughs)

00:08:23.846 --> 00:08:28.902
So, with social media and a vibrant,
vibrant African diaspora,

00:08:28.926 --> 00:08:33.005
more and more the world
is dancing to our rhythm

00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:34.562
and talking our pidgin.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.640
Yeah? (Laughs)

00:08:36.664 --> 00:08:39.236
Thanks, Nigeria, we'll use that
for across the board.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.410
(Laughter)

00:08:41.204 --> 00:08:43.759
Our next song, "Kuliko Jana,"
had a viral video

00:08:43.783 --> 00:08:49.061
that was posted by Snoop Dogg,
Ne-Yo, Talib Kweli.

00:08:49.568 --> 00:08:52.116
And the general feedback of this song,

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.831
especially in the black community
in the United States,

00:08:55.855 --> 00:08:59.609
was that this song gave them
a feeling or a sense

00:08:59.633 --> 00:09:01.366
of spiritual repatriation.

00:09:01.696 --> 00:09:03.982
So, ladies and gentlemen, "Kuliko Jana."

00:09:04.006 --> 00:09:05.655
(Cheering)

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:06.829
(Vocalizing)

00:09:26.172 --> 00:09:27.323
(Vocalizing ends)

00:09:27.347 --> 00:09:29.158
Bwana ni mwokozi wangu

00:09:30.339 --> 00:09:32.670
Tena ni kiongozi wangu

00:09:33.267 --> 00:09:38.441
Ananipenda leo kuliko jana

00:09:38.948 --> 00:09:41.220
Baraka zake hazikwishi

00:09:41.566 --> 00:09:43.710
Si kama binadamu habadiliki

00:09:44.982 --> 00:09:49.772
Ananipenda leo kuliko jana

00:09:50.788 --> 00:09:53.407
Kuliko jana

00:09:53.737 --> 00:09:56.294
Kuliko jana

00:09:56.649 --> 00:10:01.907
Yesu nipende leo kuliko jana

00:10:02.576 --> 00:10:04.926
Kuliko jana

00:10:05.445 --> 00:10:07.765
Kuliko jana

00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:13.651
Yesu nipende leo kuliko jana

00:10:14.403 --> 00:10:16.636
Wewe ndio nategemea

Na tena ni kiongozi wangu

00:11:06.909 --> 00:11:11.802

Kuliko jana

00:11:30.348 --> 00:11:35.534
Yesu nipende leo kuliko jana

00:11:36.181 --> 00:11:38.788
Kuliko jana

00:11:39.268 --> 00:11:41.796
Kuliko jana

00:11:42.114 --> 00:11:48.003
Yesu nipende leo kuliko jana

00:11:48.027 --> 00:11:50.059
Na Bwana ni mwokozi wangu

00:11:51.035 --> 00:11:52.702
Na tena ni mkombozi wangu
