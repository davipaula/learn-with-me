00:00:13.927 --> 00:00:16.857
It is almost the end of the winter,

00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:19.452
and you've woken up to a cold house,

00:00:19.476 --> 00:00:22.873
which is weird, because
you left the heater on all night.

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:25.425
You turn on the light.

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:26.699
It's not working.

00:00:27.252 --> 00:00:32.519
Actually, the coffee maker, the TV --
none of them are working.

00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:35.732
Life outside also seems to have stopped.

00:00:36.796 --> 00:00:38.624
There are no schools,

00:00:38.648 --> 00:00:40.889
most of the businesses are shut,

00:00:40.913 --> 00:00:42.939
and there are no working trains.

00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:47.558
This is not the opening scene
of a zombie apocalypse movie.

00:00:48.332 --> 00:00:54.244
This is what happened in March 1989
in the Canadian province of Quebec,

00:00:54.268 --> 00:00:56.948
when the power grid lost power.

00:00:57.523 --> 00:00:58.686
The culprit?

00:00:59.106 --> 00:01:00.304
A solar storm.

00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:04.614
Solar storms are giant clouds of particles

00:01:04.638 --> 00:01:06.916
escaping from the Sun from time to time,

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.289
and a constant reminder that we live
in the neighborhood of an active star.

00:01:13.157 --> 00:01:15.765
And I, as a solar physicist,

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.509
I have a tremendous chance
to study these solar storms.

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:22.254
But you see, "solar storm chaser"

00:01:22.278 --> 00:01:23.950
is not just a cool title.

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.435
My research helps to understand
where they come from,

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:29.903
how they behave

00:01:29.927 --> 00:01:31.102
and, in the long run,

00:01:31.126 --> 00:01:34.124
aims to mitigate their effects
on human societies,

00:01:34.148 --> 00:01:35.830
which I'll get to in a second.

00:01:37.106 --> 00:01:42.650
At the beginning of the space
exploration age 50 years ago only,

00:01:42.674 --> 00:01:44.832
the probes we sent in space

00:01:44.856 --> 00:01:47.670
revealed that the planets
in our Solar System

00:01:47.694 --> 00:01:52.144
constantly bathe in a stream of particles
that are coming from the Sun

00:01:52.168 --> 00:01:54.769
and that we call the solar wind.

00:01:55.722 --> 00:01:59.339
And in the same way that global wind
patterns here on Earth

00:01:59.363 --> 00:02:01.561
can be affected by hurricanes,

00:02:01.585 --> 00:02:05.346
the solar wind is sometimes
affected by solar storms

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.546
that I like to call "space hurricanes."

00:02:09.687 --> 00:02:11.640
When they arrive at planets,

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.889
they can perturb the space environment,

00:02:13.913 --> 00:02:17.198
which in turn creates
the northern or southern lights,

00:02:17.222 --> 00:02:19.410
for example, here on Earth,

00:02:19.434 --> 00:02:21.302
but also Saturn

00:02:21.953 --> 00:02:23.906
and also Jupiter.

00:02:25.151 --> 00:02:27.839
Luckily, here on Earth,

00:02:27.863 --> 00:02:30.954
we are protected
by our planet's natural shield,

00:02:30.978 --> 00:02:34.089
a magnetic bubble that we call
the magnetosphere

00:02:34.113 --> 00:02:36.491
and that you can see here
on the right side.

00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:40.529
Nonetheless, solar storms
can still be responsible

00:02:40.553 --> 00:02:45.167
for disrupting satellite
telecommunications and operations,

00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:48.796
for disrupting navigation
systems, such as GPS,

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.301
as well as electric power transmission.

00:02:51.895 --> 00:02:57.749
All of these are technologies
on which us humans rely more and more.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.883
I mean, imagine if you woke up tomorrow
without a working cell phone --

00:03:03.692 --> 00:03:05.245
no internet on it,

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.775
which means no social media.

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.723
I mean, to me that would be worse
than the zombie apocalypse.

00:03:10.747 --> 00:03:11.955
(Laughter)

00:03:12.605 --> 00:03:14.700
By constantly monitoring the Sun, though,

00:03:14.724 --> 00:03:17.115
we now know where
the solar storms come from.

00:03:17.753 --> 00:03:19.698
They come from regions of the Sun

00:03:19.722 --> 00:03:23.014
where a tremendous amount
of energy is being stored.

00:03:23.038 --> 00:03:24.550
You have an example here,

00:03:24.574 --> 00:03:28.384
as a complex structure
hanging above the solar surface,

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:30.829
just on the verge of erupting.

00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:34.763
Unfortunately, we cannot send probes

00:03:34.787 --> 00:03:38.206
in the scorching hot
atmosphere of the Sun,

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.438
where temperatures can rise
up to around 10 million degrees Kelvin.

00:03:44.227 --> 00:03:48.438
So what I do is I use computer simulations

00:03:48.462 --> 00:03:53.295
in order to analyze but also to predict
the behavior of these storms

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.100
when they're just born at the Sun.

00:03:57.421 --> 00:04:00.018
This is only one part
of the story, though.

00:04:01.486 --> 00:04:05.344
When these solar storms
are moving in space,

00:04:05.368 --> 00:04:08.974
some of them will inevitably
encounter space probes

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:13.606
that we humans have sent
in order to explore other worlds.

00:04:14.105 --> 00:04:16.938
What I mean by other worlds is,
for example, planets,

00:04:16.962 --> 00:04:19.062
such as Venus or Mercury,

00:04:19.086 --> 00:04:21.806
but also objects, such as comets.

00:04:22.584 --> 00:04:25.170
And while these space probes
have been made

00:04:25.194 --> 00:04:27.905
for different scientific endeavors,

00:04:27.929 --> 00:04:33.066
they can also act like tiny
cosmic meteorological stations

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.083
and monitor the evolution
of these space storms.

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:42.314
So I, with a group of researchers,
gather and analyze this data

00:04:42.338 --> 00:04:45.387
coming from different
locations of the Solar System.

00:04:45.411 --> 00:04:48.727
And by doing so, my research
shows that, actually,

00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:50.839
solar storms have a generic shape,

00:04:50.863 --> 00:04:55.368
and that this shape evolves
as solar storms move away from the Sun.

00:04:55.392 --> 00:04:56.547
And you know what?

00:04:56.571 --> 00:05:01.904
This is key for building tools
to predict space weather.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.505
I would like to leave you
with this beautiful image.

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:08.938
This is us here on Earth,

00:05:09.692 --> 00:05:11.009
this pale blue dot.

00:05:11.736 --> 00:05:15.400
And while I study the Sun
and its storms every day,

00:05:15.424 --> 00:05:19.350
I will always have a deep love
for this beautiful planet --

00:05:20.076 --> 00:05:21.467
a pale blue dot indeed,

00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:25.375
but a pale blue dot
with an invisible magnetic shield

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:27.605
that helps to protect us.

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:28.935
Thank you.

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:32.300
(Applause)
