00:00:06.616 --> 00:00:10.513
Humans have been fascinated
with speed for ages.

00:00:10.513 --> 00:00:14.746
The history of human progress
is one of ever-increasing velocity,

00:00:14.746 --> 00:00:18.611
and one of the most important achievements
in this historical race

00:00:18.611 --> 00:00:21.503
was the breaking of the sound barrier.

00:00:21.503 --> 00:00:24.871
Not long after the first
successful airplane flights,

00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:29.983
pilots were eager to push
their planes to go faster and faster.

00:00:29.983 --> 00:00:32.384
But as they did so, increased turbulence

00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:37.688
and large forces on the plane
prevented them from accelerating further.

00:00:37.688 --> 00:00:41.647
Some tried to circumvent
the problem through risky dives,

00:00:41.647 --> 00:00:44.085
often with tragic results.

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:47.550
Finally, in 1947, design improvements,

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.302
such as a movable horizontal stabilizer,
the all-moving tail,

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:55.521
allowed an American military pilot
named Chuck Yeager

00:00:55.521 --> 00:01:03.721
to fly the Bell X-1 aircraft at 1127 km/h,

00:01:03.721 --> 00:01:06.924
becoming the first person
to break the sound barrier

00:01:06.924 --> 00:01:09.720
and travel faster than the speed of sound.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.929
The Bell X-1 was the first of many
supersonic aircraft to follow,

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:17.913
with later designs reaching
speeds over Mach 3.

00:01:17.913 --> 00:01:21.573
Aircraft traveling at supersonic speed
create a shock wave

00:01:21.573 --> 00:01:25.682
with a thunder-like noise
known as a sonic boom,

00:01:25.682 --> 00:01:29.179
which can cause distress to people
and animals below

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.070
or even damage buildings.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.070
For this reason,

00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:35.345
scientists around the world
have been looking at sonic booms,

00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:37.788
trying to predict their path
in the atmosphere,

00:01:37.788 --> 00:01:42.191
where they will land,
and how loud they will be.

00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:45.310
To better understand
how scientists study sonic booms,

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.298
let's start with some basics of sound.

00:01:48.298 --> 00:01:51.931
Imagine throwing a small stone
in a still pond.

00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:53.177
What do you see?

00:01:53.177 --> 00:01:55.875
The stone causes waves
to travel in the water

00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:58.670
at the same speed in every direction.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.887
These circles that keep growing in radius
are called wave fronts.

00:02:02.887 --> 00:02:05.904
Similarly, even though we cannot see it,

00:02:05.904 --> 00:02:09.306
a stationary sound source,
like a home stereo,

00:02:09.306 --> 00:02:12.199
creates sound waves traveling outward.

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.330
The speed of the waves depends on factors

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.110
like the altitude and temperature
of the air they move through.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.463
At sea level, sound travels
at about 1225 km/h.

00:02:24.463 --> 00:02:27.290
But instead of circles
on a two-dimensional surface,

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.732
the wave fronts
are now concentric spheres,

00:02:30.732 --> 00:02:35.901
with the sound traveling along rays
perpendicular to these waves.

00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:40.076
Now imagine a moving sound source,
such as a train whistle.

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:43.034
As the source keeps moving
in a certain direction,

00:02:43.034 --> 00:02:47.566
the successive waves in front of it
will become bunched closer together.

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:52.636
This greater wave frequency is the cause
of the famous Doppler effect,

00:02:52.636 --> 00:02:55.729
where approaching objects
sound higher pitched.

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:59.927
But as long as the source is moving
slower than the sound waves themselves,

00:02:59.927 --> 00:03:02.756
they will remain nested within each other.

00:03:02.756 --> 00:03:07.771
It's when an object goes supersonic,
moving faster than the sound it makes,

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:10.597
that the picture changes dramatically.

00:03:10.597 --> 00:03:13.200
As it overtakes sound waves
it has emitted,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.702
while generating new ones from
its current position,

00:03:15.702 --> 00:03:19.820
the waves are forced together,
forming a Mach cone.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.808
No sound is heard
as it approaches an observer

00:03:22.808 --> 00:03:27.888
because the object is traveling faster
than the sound it produces.

00:03:27.888 --> 00:03:33.051
Only after the object has passed
will the observer hear the sonic boom.

00:03:33.051 --> 00:03:37.007
Where the Mach cone meets the ground,
it forms a hyperbola,

00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:41.306
leaving a trail known as the boom carpet
as it travels forward.

00:03:41.306 --> 00:03:46.253
This makes it possible to determine
the area affected by a sonic boom.

00:03:46.253 --> 00:03:49.303
What about figuring out how strong
a sonic boom will be?

00:03:49.303 --> 00:03:52.869
This involves solving the famous
Navier-Stokes equations

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:56.265
to find the variation
of pressure in the air

00:03:56.265 --> 00:03:59.516
due to the supersonic aircraft
flying through it.

00:03:59.516 --> 00:04:03.853
This results in the pressure signature
known as the N-wave.

00:04:03.853 --> 00:04:05.483
What does this shape mean?

00:04:05.483 --> 00:04:09.506
Well, the sonic boom occurs
when there is a sudden change in pressure,

00:04:09.506 --> 00:04:11.918
and the N-wave involves two booms:

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:15.497
one for the initial pressure rise
at the aircraft's nose,

00:04:15.497 --> 00:04:18.349
and another for when the tail passes,

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.017
and the pressure suddenly
returns to normal.

00:04:21.017 --> 00:04:23.130
This causes a double boom,

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.636
but it is usually heard as a single boom
by human ears.

00:04:26.636 --> 00:04:29.878
In practice, computer models
using these principles

00:04:29.878 --> 00:04:34.023
can often predict the location
and intensity of sonic booms

00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:37.626
for given atmospheric conditions
and flight trajectories,

00:04:37.626 --> 00:04:40.738
and there is ongoing research
to mitigate their effects.

00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:45.809
In the meantime, supersonic flight
over land remains prohibited.

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:48.572
So, are sonic booms a recent creation?

00:04:48.572 --> 00:04:50.088
Not exactly.

00:04:50.088 --> 00:04:52.516
While we try to find ways to silence them,

00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:56.045
a few other animals have been
using sonic booms to their advantage.

00:04:56.045 --> 00:05:00.954
The gigantic Diplodocus may have been
capable of cracking its tail

00:05:00.998 --> 00:05:07.937
faster than sound, at over 1200 km/h,
possibly to deter predators.

00:05:07.937 --> 00:05:12.437
Some types of shrimp can also create
a similar shock wave underwater,

00:05:12.437 --> 00:05:16.163
stunning or even killing pray
at a distance

00:05:16.163 --> 00:05:19.733
with just a snap of their oversized claw.

00:05:19.733 --> 00:05:22.203
So while we humans
have made great progress

00:05:22.203 --> 00:05:24.853
in our relentless pursuit of speed,

00:05:24.853 --> 00:05:27.413
it turns out that nature was there first.
