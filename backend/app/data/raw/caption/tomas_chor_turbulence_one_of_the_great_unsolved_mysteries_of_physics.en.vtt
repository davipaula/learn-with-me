00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.550
You’re on an airplane 
when you feel a sudden jolt.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.260
Outside your window nothing 
seems to be happening,

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.320
yet the plane continues to rattle 
you and your fellow passengers

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.460
as it passes through turbulent air
in the atmosphere.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.929
Although it may not comfort 
you to hear it,

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.339
this phenomenon is one of the 
prevailing mysteries of physics.

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:31.353
After more than a century 
of studying turbulence,

00:00:31.353 --> 00:00:34.473
we’ve only come up with a few 
answers for how it works

00:00:34.473 --> 00:00:36.823
and affects the world around us.

00:00:36.823 --> 00:00:39.283
And yet, turbulence is ubiquitous,

00:00:39.283 --> 00:00:44.143
springing up in virtually any system 
that has moving fluids.

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:47.313
That includes the airflow 
in your respiratory tract.

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:49.663
The blood moving through your arteries.

00:00:49.663 --> 00:00:53.073
And the coffee in your cup, 
as you stir it.

00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:55.313
Clouds are governed by turbulence,

00:00:55.313 --> 00:01:00.893
as are waves crashing along the shore 
and the gusts of plasma in our sun.

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:04.043
Understanding precisely how this 
phenomenon works

00:01:04.043 --> 00:01:07.933
would have a bearing on so many 
aspects of our lives.

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.313
Here’s what we do know.

00:01:09.313 --> 00:01:12.813
Liquids and gases usually have 
two types of motion:

00:01:12.813 --> 00:01:15.933
a laminar flow, which is stable 
and smooth;

00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:21.253
and a turbulent flow, which is composed 
of seemingly unorganized swirls.

00:01:21.253 --> 00:01:23.723
Imagine an incense stick.

00:01:23.723 --> 00:01:29.503
The laminar flow of unruffled smoke 
at the base is steady and easy to predict.

00:01:29.503 --> 00:01:30.936
Closer to the top, however,

00:01:30.936 --> 00:01:33.896
the smoke accelerates, becomes unstable,

00:01:33.896 --> 00:01:38.426
and the pattern of movement changes
to something chaotic.

00:01:38.426 --> 00:01:40.336
That’s turbulence in action,

00:01:40.336 --> 00:01:44.766
and turbulent flows have certain
characteristics in common.

00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:48.556
Firstly, turbulence is always chaotic.

00:01:48.556 --> 00:01:50.596
That’s different from being random.

00:01:50.596 --> 00:01:55.386
Rather, this means that turbulence 
is very sensitive to disruptions.

00:01:55.386 --> 00:01:57.854
A little nudge one way or the other

00:01:57.854 --> 00:02:01.514
will eventually turn into 
completely different results.

00:02:01.514 --> 00:02:05.094
That makes it nearly impossible 
to predict what will happen,

00:02:05.094 --> 00:02:09.814
even with a lot of information 
about the current state of a system.

00:02:09.814 --> 00:02:12.242
Another important characteristic of 
turbulence

00:02:12.242 --> 00:02:16.562
is the different scales of motion 
that these flows display.

00:02:16.562 --> 00:02:21.192
Turbulent flows have many 
differently-sized whirls called eddies,

00:02:21.192 --> 00:02:25.572
which are like vortices of 
different sizes and shapes.

00:02:25.572 --> 00:02:28.837
All those differently-sized eddies 
interact with each other,

00:02:28.837 --> 00:02:31.227
breaking up to become smaller and smaller

00:02:31.227 --> 00:02:34.887
until all that movement is 
transformed into heat,

00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:38.457
in a process called the “energy cascade."

00:02:38.457 --> 00:02:40.817
So that’s how we recognize turbulence–

00:02:40.817 --> 00:02:42.557
but why does it happen?

00:02:42.557 --> 00:02:46.657
In every flowing liquid or gas there 
are two opposing forces:

00:02:46.657 --> 00:02:48.757
inertia and viscosity.

00:02:48.757 --> 00:02:52.167
Inertia is the tendency of fluids 
to keep moving,

00:02:52.167 --> 00:02:54.167
which causes instability.

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:56.817
Viscosity works against disruption,

00:02:56.817 --> 00:02:59.877
making the flow laminar instead.

00:02:59.877 --> 00:03:01.917
In thick fluids such as honey,

00:03:01.917 --> 00:03:04.687
viscosity almost always wins.

00:03:04.687 --> 00:03:09.687
Less viscous substances like water or air 
are more prone to inertia,

00:03:09.687 --> 00:03:14.210
which creates instabilities that 
develop into turbulence.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.310
We measure where a flow falls 
on that spectrum

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.980
with something called the Reynolds number,

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.230
which is the ratio between a flow’s 
inertia and its viscosity.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.940
The higher the Reynolds number,

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.200
the more likely it is that 
turbulence will occur.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.792
Honey being poured into a cup, 
for example,

00:03:31.792 --> 00:03:34.512
has a Reynolds number of about 1.

00:03:34.512 --> 00:03:39.762
The same set up with water has a Reynolds 
number that’s closer to 10,000.

00:03:39.762 --> 00:03:43.265
The Reynolds number is useful for 
understanding simple scenarios,

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:46.595
but it’s ineffective in many situations.

00:03:46.595 --> 00:03:50.595
For example, the motion of the atmosphere
is significantly influenced

00:03:50.595 --> 00:03:55.335
by factors including gravity and the 
earth’s rotation.

00:03:55.335 --> 00:04:00.024
Or take relatively simple things 
like the drag on buildings and cars.

00:04:00.024 --> 00:04:03.886
We can model those thanks to many 
experiments and empirical evidence.

00:04:03.886 --> 00:04:08.686
But physicists want to be able to predict 
them through physical laws and equations

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.790
as well as we can model the orbits 
of planets or electromagnetic fields.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.935
Most scientists think that getting there 
will rely on statistics

00:04:17.935 --> 00:04:20.049
and increased computing power.

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.869
Extremely high-speed computer simulations 
of turbulent flows

00:04:23.869 --> 00:04:27.869
could help us identify patterns that could
lead to a theory

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:33.479
that organizes and unifies predictions
across different situations.

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.291
Other scientists think that the phenomenon
is so complex

00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:41.951
that such a full-fledged theory 
isn’t ever going to be possible.

00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:43.775
Hopefully we’ll reach a breakthrough,

00:04:43.775 --> 00:04:47.896
because a true understanding of turbulence
could have huge positive impacts.

00:04:47.896 --> 00:04:50.546
That would include more 
efficient wind farms;

00:04:50.546 --> 00:04:53.966
the ability to better prepare for 
catastrophic weather events;

00:04:53.966 --> 00:04:57.836
or even the power to manipulate 
hurricanes away.

00:04:57.836 --> 00:05:03.017
And, of course, smoother rides 
for millions of airline passengers.
