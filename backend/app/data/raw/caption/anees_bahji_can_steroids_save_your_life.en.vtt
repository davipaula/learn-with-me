00:00:07.146 --> 00:00:10.836
Steroids: they’re infamous 
for their use in sports.

00:00:10.836 --> 00:00:15.747
But they’re also found in inhalers, 
creams to treat poison ivy and eczema,

00:00:15.747 --> 00:00:18.337
and shots to ease inflammation.

00:00:18.337 --> 00:00:23.400
The steroids in these medicines aren’t 
the same as the ones used to build muscle.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.190
In fact, they’re all based on 
yet another steroid—

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.640
one our body produces naturally, 
and we can’t live without.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.339
Taking a step back, the reason 
there are so many different steroids

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:39.941
is because the term refers to substances 
with a shared molecular structure,

00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:42.881
rather than shared effects on the body.

00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:45.750
Steroids can be naturally occurring 
or synthetic,

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.900
but what all steroids have in common 
is a molecular structure

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.970
that consists of a base of four rings 
made of 17 carbon atoms

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.050
arranged in three hexagons 
and one pentagon.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.683
A molecule must contain 
this exact arrangement to be a steroid,

00:01:03.683 --> 00:01:06.753
though most also have side chains—

00:01:06.753 --> 00:01:12.079
additional atoms that can dramatically 
impact the molecule’s function.

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.039
Steroids get their name 
from the fatty molecule cholesterol.

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:20.032
In fact, our bodies make steroids 
out of cholesterol.

00:01:20.032 --> 00:01:23.242
That fatty cholesterol base 
means that steroids

00:01:23.242 --> 00:01:27.602
are able to cross fatty cell membranes 
and enter cells.

00:01:27.602 --> 00:01:31.422
Within the cell, they can directly 
influence gene expression

00:01:31.422 --> 00:01:33.789
and protein synthesis.

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.399
This is different from many other types 
of signaling molecules,

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.469
which can’t cross the cell membrane

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:42.859
and have to create their effects 
from outside the cell,

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:45.628
through more complicated pathways.

00:01:45.628 --> 00:01:51.185
So steroids can create their effects 
faster than those other molecules.

00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:55.065
Back to the steroids 
in anti-inflammatory medications:

00:01:55.065 --> 00:02:00.025
all of these are based on a naturally 
occurring steroid called cortisol.

00:02:00.025 --> 00:02:03.265
Cortisol is the body’s 
primary stress signal,

00:02:03.265 --> 00:02:05.809
and it has a huge range of functions.

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:07.959
When we experience a stressor—

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.209
anything from a fight with a friend, 
to spotting a bear,

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.942
to an infection or low blood sugar—

00:02:13.942 --> 00:02:19.935
the brain reacts by sending a signal from 
the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland.

00:02:19.935 --> 00:02:24.477
The pituitary gland then sends a signal 
to the adrenal glands.

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:28.951
The adrenal glands produce cortisol, 
and release some constantly.

00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:32.521
But when they receive the signal 
from the pituitary gland,

00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:34.842
they release a burst of cortisol,

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:38.462
which spurs the body to generate 
more glucose for energy,

00:02:38.462 --> 00:02:42.882
decrease functions not immediately 
related to survival, like digestion,

00:02:42.882 --> 00:02:46.763
and can activate 
a fight-flight-or-freeze response.

00:02:46.763 --> 00:02:51.032
This is helpful in the short term, 
but can cause undesirable side effects

00:02:51.032 --> 00:02:55.299
like insomnia and lowered mood 
if they last too long.

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.675
Cortisol also interacts 
with the immune system in complex ways—

00:02:59.675 --> 00:03:01.012
depending on the situation,

00:03:01.012 --> 00:03:04.779
it can increase or decrease 
certain immune functions.

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:06.769
In the process of fighting infection,

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.929
the immune system 
often creates inflammation.

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:14.179
Cortisol suppresses the immune system’s 
ability to produce inflammation,

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:17.335
which, again, 
can be useful in the short term.

00:03:17.335 --> 00:03:20.349
But too much cortisol 
can have negative impacts,

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.988
like reducing the immune system’s ability 
to regenerate bone marrow and lymph nodes.

00:03:25.988 --> 00:03:29.138
To prevent levels 
from staying high for too long,

00:03:29.138 --> 00:03:32.935
cortisol suppresses the signal 
that causes the adrenal glands

00:03:32.935 --> 00:03:35.135
to release more cortisol.

00:03:35.135 --> 00:03:39.828
Medicinal corticosteroids channel 
cortisol’s effects on the immune system

00:03:39.828 --> 00:03:44.008
to fight allergic reactions, 
rashes, and asthma.

00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:46.844
All these things are forms 
of inflammation.

00:03:46.844 --> 00:03:50.915
There are many synthetic steroids 
that share the same basic mechanism:

00:03:50.915 --> 00:03:53.405
they enhance the body’s cortisol supply,

00:03:53.405 --> 00:03:56.908
which in turn shuts down 
the hyperactive immune responses

00:03:56.908 --> 00:03:59.095
that cause inflammation.

00:03:59.095 --> 00:04:04.041
These corticosteroids sneak into cells 
and can turn off the “fire alarm”

00:04:04.041 --> 00:04:08.889
by suppressing gene expression 
of inflammatory signals.

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:13.914
The steroids in inhalers and creams impact
only the affected organ—

00:04:13.914 --> 00:04:16.124
the skin, or the lungs.

00:04:16.124 --> 00:04:20.885
Intravenous or oral versions, used 
to treat chronic autoimmune conditions

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:26.317
like lupus or inflammatory bowel disease, 
impact the whole body.

00:04:26.317 --> 00:04:30.740
With these conditions, the body’s 
immune system attacks its own cells,

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.419
a process analogous to a constant 
asthma attack or rash.

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.769
A constant low dose of steroids

00:04:37.769 --> 00:04:41.648
can help keep this renegade
immune response under control—

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:45.258
but because of the negative psychological 
and physiological effects

00:04:45.258 --> 00:04:46.704
of longterm exposure,

00:04:46.704 --> 00:04:51.488
higher doses are reserved 
for emergencies and flare-ups.

00:04:51.488 --> 00:04:55.498
While an asthma attack, poison ivy welts, 
and irritable bowel syndrome

00:04:55.498 --> 00:04:59.582
might seem totally unrelated, 
they all have something in common:

00:04:59.582 --> 00:05:03.790
an immune response 
that’s doing more harm than good.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.091
And while corticosteroids 
won’t give you giant muscles,

00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:10.624
they can be the body’s best defense 
against itself.
