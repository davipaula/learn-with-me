00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:17.327
Right now, there's a lot
happening with the Moon.

00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:21.162
China has announced plans
for an inhabited South Pole station

00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:23.041
by the 2030s,

00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:25.652
and the United States has
an official road map

00:00:25.676 --> 00:00:30.473
seeking an increasing number of people
living and working in space.

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.949
This will start with
NASA's Artemis program,

00:00:32.973 --> 00:00:36.926
an international program to send
the first woman and the next man

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.854
to the Moon this decade.

00:00:38.878 --> 00:00:41.576
Billionaires and the private sector
are getting involved

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.367
in unprecedented ways.

00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:47.244
There are over a hundred
launch companies around the world

00:00:47.268 --> 00:00:50.919
and roughly a dozen private
lunar transportation companies

00:00:50.943 --> 00:00:53.905
readying robotic missions
to the lunar surface.

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:58.619
We have reusable rockets
for the first time in human history.

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:01.716
This will enable the development
of infrastructure

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.707
and utilization of resources.

00:01:04.227 --> 00:01:06.767
While estimates vary, scientists think

00:01:06.791 --> 00:01:10.902
there could be up to a billion metric tons
of water ice on the Moon.

00:01:10.926 --> 00:01:13.354
That's greater than the size of Lake Erie,

00:01:13.378 --> 00:01:17.351
and enough water to support
perhaps hundreds of thousands of people

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:19.505
living and working on the Moon.

00:01:20.092 --> 00:01:23.099
So although official plans
are always evolving,

00:01:23.123 --> 00:01:25.738
there's real reason to think
that we could see people

00:01:25.762 --> 00:01:27.555
starting to live and work on the Moon

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:28.789
in the next decade.

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:34.148
However, the Moon is roughly
the size of the continent of Africa,

00:01:34.172 --> 00:01:36.934
and we're starting to see
that the key resources

00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.232
may be concentrated in small areas

00:01:39.256 --> 00:01:40.562
near the poles.

00:01:41.053 --> 00:01:46.062
This raises important questions about
coordinating access to scarce resources.

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:50.670
And there are also legitimate questions
about going to the Moon:

00:01:50.694 --> 00:01:52.672
colonialism, cultural heritage

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:56.723
and reproducing the systemic inequalities
of today's capitalism.

00:01:57.442 --> 00:01:59.268
And more to the point:

00:01:59.292 --> 00:02:02.051
Don't we have enough
big challenges here on Earth?

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:06.787
Internet governance, pandemics, terrorism
and, perhaps most importantly,

00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:09.500
climate crisis and biodiversity loss.

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:11.686
In some senses,

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.165
the idea of the Moon as just a destination

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.997
embodies these problematic qualities.

00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:20.119
It conjures a frontier attitude

00:02:20.143 --> 00:02:21.537
of conquest,

00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:23.913
big rockets and expensive projects,

00:02:23.937 --> 00:02:25.812
competition and winning.

00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:29.305
But what's most interesting about the Moon

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.870
isn't the billionaires with their rockets

00:02:31.894 --> 00:02:34.927
or the same old
power struggle between states.

00:02:35.495 --> 00:02:38.140
In fact, it's not the hardware at all.

00:02:38.837 --> 00:02:40.700
It's the software.

00:02:40.724 --> 00:02:43.244
It's the norms, customs and laws.

00:02:43.268 --> 00:02:45.497
It's our social technologies.

00:02:45.902 --> 00:02:49.668
And it's the opportunity to update
our democratic institutions

00:02:49.692 --> 00:02:51.521
and the rule of law

00:02:51.545 --> 00:02:55.559
to respond to a new era
of planetary-scale challenges.

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.660
I'm going to tell you about
how the Moon can be a canvas

00:02:59.684 --> 00:03:02.915
for solving some of our biggest
challenges here on Earth.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.522
I've been kind of obsessed with this topic
since I was a teenager.

00:03:08.546 --> 00:03:13.294
I've spent the last two decades
working on international space policy,

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:17.608
but also on small community projects
with bottom-up governance design.

00:03:18.462 --> 00:03:19.870
When I was 17,

00:03:19.894 --> 00:03:23.206
I went to a UN conference
on the peaceful uses of outer space

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.403
in Vienna.

00:03:25.002 --> 00:03:29.429
Over two weeks, 160 young people
from over 60 countries

00:03:29.453 --> 00:03:32.861
were crammed into a big hotel
next to the UN building.

00:03:33.405 --> 00:03:35.412
We were invited to make recommendations

00:03:35.436 --> 00:03:36.603
to Member States

00:03:36.627 --> 00:03:39.565
about the role of space
in humanity's future.

00:03:40.452 --> 00:03:41.834
After the conference,

00:03:41.858 --> 00:03:43.553
some of us were so inspired

00:03:43.577 --> 00:03:46.416
that we actually decided
to keep living together.

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:51.130
Now, living with 20 people
might sound kind of crazy,

00:03:51.154 --> 00:03:56.665
but over the years, it enabled us
to create a high-trust group

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:01.228
that allowed us to experiment
with these social technologies.

00:04:01.252 --> 00:04:05.273
We designed governance systems
ranging from assigning a CEO

00:04:05.297 --> 00:04:07.409
to using a jury process.

00:04:07.941 --> 00:04:10.420
And as we grew into our careers,

00:04:10.444 --> 00:04:13.883
and we moved from DC think tanks
to working for NASA

00:04:13.907 --> 00:04:16.400
to starting our own companies,

00:04:16.424 --> 00:04:18.952
these experiments enabled us to see

00:04:18.976 --> 00:04:21.980
how even small groups
could be a petri dish

00:04:22.004 --> 00:04:25.732
for important societal questions
such as representation,

00:04:25.756 --> 00:04:28.016
sustainability or opportunity.

00:04:28.993 --> 00:04:32.741
People often talk about the Moon
as a petri dish

00:04:32.765 --> 00:04:34.610
or even a blank slate.

00:04:35.506 --> 00:04:39.797
But because of the legal agreements
that govern the Moon,

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:42.989
it actually has something
very important in common

00:04:43.013 --> 00:04:45.608
with our global challenges here on Earth.

00:04:46.343 --> 00:04:52.538
They both involve issues that require us
to think beyond territory and borders,

00:04:52.562 --> 00:04:55.166
meaning the Moon is actually
more of a template

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.778
than a blank slate.

00:04:57.922 --> 00:05:03.288
Signed in 1967, the Outer Space Treaty
is the defining treaty

00:05:03.312 --> 00:05:05.466
governing activities in outer space,

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.829
including the Moon.

00:05:07.645 --> 00:05:09.804
And it has two key ingredients

00:05:09.828 --> 00:05:14.357
that radically alter the basis
on which laws can be constructed.

00:05:14.904 --> 00:05:20.966
The first is a requirement for free access
to all areas of a celestial body.

00:05:21.935 --> 00:05:25.951
And the second is that the Moon
and other celestial bodies

00:05:25.975 --> 00:05:29.598
are not subject to national appropriation.

00:05:29.622 --> 00:05:32.406
Now, this is crazy,

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.168
because the entire earthly
international system --

00:05:36.192 --> 00:05:37.418
the United Nations,

00:05:37.442 --> 00:05:40.294
the system of treaties
and international agreements --

00:05:40.318 --> 00:05:43.588
is built on the idea of state sovereignty,

00:05:43.612 --> 00:05:46.919
on the appropriation of land
and resources within borders

00:05:46.943 --> 00:05:50.744
and the autonomy to control free access
within those borders.

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:53.839
By doing away with both of these,

00:05:53.863 --> 00:05:57.132
we create the conditions
for what are called the "commons."

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:01.912
Based on the work of Nobel
Prize-winning economist Elinor Ostrom,

00:06:01.936 --> 00:06:05.743
global commons are those resources
that we all share

00:06:05.767 --> 00:06:08.645
that require us to work together
to manage and protect

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:12.551
important aspects
of our survival and well-being,

00:06:12.575 --> 00:06:14.970
like climate or the oceans.

00:06:15.414 --> 00:06:19.748
Commons-based approaches offer
a greenfield for institution design

00:06:19.772 --> 00:06:21.581
that's only beginning to be explored

00:06:21.605 --> 00:06:24.741
at the global and interplanetary level.

00:06:24.765 --> 00:06:26.445
What do property rights look like?

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.208
And how do we manage resources

00:06:28.232 --> 00:06:32.668
when the traditional tools
of external authority and private property

00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:33.902
don't apply?

00:06:34.429 --> 00:06:36.687
Though we don't have all the answers,

00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:39.822
climate, internet governance,
authoritarianism --

00:06:39.846 --> 00:06:42.593
these are all deeply existential threats

00:06:42.617 --> 00:06:45.665
that we have failed to address
with our current ways of thinking.

00:06:46.486 --> 00:06:50.580
Successful paths forward
will require us to develop new tools.

00:06:51.143 --> 00:06:55.014
So how do we incorporate
commons-based logic

00:06:55.038 --> 00:06:58.399
into our global and space institutions?

00:06:59.088 --> 00:07:03.862
Well, here's one attempt
that came from an unlikely source.

00:07:03.886 --> 00:07:06.810
As a young activist in World War II,

00:07:06.834 --> 00:07:10.134
Arvid Pardo was arrested
for anti-fascist organizing

00:07:10.158 --> 00:07:13.340
and held under death sentence
by the Gestapo.

00:07:13.856 --> 00:07:15.105
After the war,

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:18.092
he worked his way
into the diplomatic corps,

00:07:18.116 --> 00:07:21.779
eventually becoming the first
permanent representative of Malta

00:07:21.803 --> 00:07:23.528
to the United Nations.

00:07:23.552 --> 00:07:27.197
Pardo saw that international law
did not have the tools

00:07:27.221 --> 00:07:30.248
to address management
of shared global resources,

00:07:30.272 --> 00:07:31.976
such as the high seas.

00:07:32.683 --> 00:07:37.796
He also saw an opportunity to advocate
for equitable sharing between nations.

00:07:38.156 --> 00:07:43.310
In 1967, Pardo gave a famous speech
to the United Nations,

00:07:43.334 --> 00:07:44.959
introducing the idea

00:07:44.983 --> 00:07:50.706
that the oceans and their resources
were the "common heritage of mankind."

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:55.071
The phrase was eventually adopted
as part of the Law of the Sea Treaty,

00:07:55.095 --> 00:07:58.243
probably the most sophisticated
commons-management regime

00:07:58.267 --> 00:07:59.665
on the planet today.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.603
It was seen as a watershed moment,

00:08:02.627 --> 00:08:05.125
a constitution for the seas.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.749
But the language proved so controversial

00:08:08.773 --> 00:08:11.729
that it took over 12 years
to gain enough signatures

00:08:11.753 --> 00:08:13.889
for the treaty to enter into force,

00:08:13.913 --> 00:08:17.064
and some states still refuse to sign it.

00:08:18.208 --> 00:08:22.145
The objection was not so much
about sharing per se,

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:24.370
but the obligation to share.

00:08:25.124 --> 00:08:30.314
States felt that the principle of equality
undermined their autonomy

00:08:30.338 --> 00:08:32.719
and state sovereignty,

00:08:32.743 --> 00:08:37.615
the same autonomy and state sovereignty
that underpins international law.

00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:41.030
So in many ways,

00:08:41.054 --> 00:08:43.622
the story of the common heritage principle

00:08:43.646 --> 00:08:44.930
is a tragedy.

00:08:45.819 --> 00:08:48.788
But it's powerful because it makes plain

00:08:48.812 --> 00:08:54.433
the ways in which the current world order
will put up antibodies and defenses

00:08:54.457 --> 00:08:57.378
and resist attempts at structural reform.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.087
But here's the thing:

00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:05.015
the Outer Space Treaty has already
made these structural reforms.

00:09:05.832 --> 00:09:07.426
At the height of the Cold War,

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.241
terrified that each
would get to the Moon first,

00:09:10.265 --> 00:09:12.476
the United States and the USSR

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.099
made the Westphalian equivalent
of a deal with the devil.

00:09:16.613 --> 00:09:21.373
By requiring free access
and preventing territorial appropriation,

00:09:21.397 --> 00:09:25.403
we are required to redesign
our most basic institutions,

00:09:25.427 --> 00:09:27.197
and perhaps in doing so,

00:09:27.221 --> 00:09:30.024
learn something new
we can apply here on Earth.

00:09:30.808 --> 00:09:34.865
So although the Moon might seem
a little far away sometimes,

00:09:34.889 --> 00:09:37.358
how we answer basic questions now

00:09:37.382 --> 00:09:40.500
will set precedent
for who has a seat at the table

00:09:40.524 --> 00:09:42.316
and what consent looks like.

00:09:42.928 --> 00:09:45.751
And these are questions
of social technology,

00:09:45.775 --> 00:09:47.789
not rockets and hardware.

00:09:48.703 --> 00:09:52.818
In fact, these conversations
are starting to happen right now.

00:09:53.381 --> 00:09:56.589
The space community is discussing
basic shared agreements,

00:09:56.613 --> 00:10:01.264
such as how do we designate
lunar areas as heritage sites,

00:10:01.288 --> 00:10:04.184
and how do we get permission
for where to land

00:10:04.208 --> 00:10:06.456
when traditional external authority

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.098
doesn't apply?

00:10:08.122 --> 00:10:11.096
How do we enforce requirements
for coordination

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.197
when it's against the rules
to tell people where to go?

00:10:14.727 --> 00:10:18.338
And how do we manage
access to scarce resources

00:10:18.362 --> 00:10:20.706
such as water, minerals

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:24.015
or even the peaks of eternal light --

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:26.668
craters that sit
at just the right latitude

00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:29.355
to receive near-constant
exposure to sunlight --

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:31.127
and therefore, power?

00:10:31.151 --> 00:10:35.151
Now, some people think
that the lack of rules on the Moon

00:10:35.175 --> 00:10:36.738
is terrifying.

00:10:36.762 --> 00:10:40.794
And there are legitimately
some terrifying elements of it.

00:10:41.961 --> 00:10:43.821
If there are no rules on the Moon,

00:10:43.845 --> 00:10:47.737
then won't we end up
in a first-come, first-served situation?

00:10:48.451 --> 00:10:50.464
And we might,

00:10:50.488 --> 00:10:52.700
if we dismiss this moment.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.732
But not if we're willing to be bold
and to engage the challenge.

00:10:58.826 --> 00:11:01.538
As we learned in our communities
of self-governance,

00:11:01.562 --> 00:11:06.099
it's easier to create something new
than trying to dismantle the old.

00:11:06.821 --> 00:11:08.681
And where else but the Moon

00:11:08.705 --> 00:11:12.900
can we prototype
new institutions at global scale

00:11:12.924 --> 00:11:16.903
in a self-contained environment
with the exact design constraints needed

00:11:16.927 --> 00:11:19.721
for our biggest challenges here on Earth?

00:11:21.197 --> 00:11:23.042
Back in 1999,

00:11:23.066 --> 00:11:26.546
the United Nations taught
a group of young space geeks

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:28.731
that we could think bigger,

00:11:28.755 --> 00:11:31.899
that we could impact nations
if we chose to.

00:11:32.645 --> 00:11:36.340
Today, the stage is set for the next step:

00:11:36.364 --> 00:11:40.340
to envision what comes after
territory and borders.

00:11:41.227 --> 00:11:42.379
Thank you.
