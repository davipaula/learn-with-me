00:00:06.748 --> 00:00:13.248
In 1982, a young nurse was suffering
from severe, unrelenting depression.

00:00:13.248 --> 00:00:14.888
She couldn’t work, socialize,

00:00:14.888 --> 00:00:19.188
or even concentrate well enough
to read the newspaper.

00:00:19.188 --> 00:00:21.878
One treatment changed everything.

00:00:21.878 --> 00:00:28.668
After two courses of electroconvulsive
therapy, or ECT, her symptoms lifted.

00:00:28.668 --> 00:00:33.508
She went back to work, then on to graduate
school, where she earned high grades.

00:00:33.508 --> 00:00:37.918
At first, she talked openly about
her life changing treatment.

00:00:37.918 --> 00:00:42.188
But as she realized many people had an
extremely negative impression of ECT,

00:00:42.188 --> 00:00:45.538
she stopped sharing her experience.

00:00:45.538 --> 00:00:47.728
ECT carried a deep stigma,

00:00:47.728 --> 00:00:52.268
leftover from a history that bears little
resemblance to the modern procedure.

00:00:52.268 --> 00:00:56.038
The therapy was first
used in medicine in 1938.

00:00:56.038 --> 00:01:01.228
In its early years, doctors administered a
strong electrical current to the brain,

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:03.998
causing a whole-body seizure
during which

00:01:03.998 --> 00:01:08.278
patients might bite their tongues
or even break bones.

00:01:08.278 --> 00:01:11.328
Modern ECT is very different.

00:01:11.328 --> 00:01:14.338
While a patient is under 
general anesthesia,

00:01:14.338 --> 00:01:19.298
electrodes deliver a series
of mild electrical pulses to the brain.

00:01:19.298 --> 00:01:23.728
This causes huge numbers of neurons
to fire in unison:

00:01:23.728 --> 00:01:26.918
a brief, controlled seizure.

00:01:26.918 --> 00:01:31.138
A muscle relaxant keeps spasms
from spreading to the rest of his body.

00:01:31.138 --> 00:01:35.108
The only physical indication of the
electricity flooding the brain

00:01:35.108 --> 00:01:37.318
is a twitching foot.

00:01:37.318 --> 00:01:40.428
The treatment lasts for about a minute,
and most patients are able

00:01:40.428 --> 00:01:45.098
to resume normal activities about an
hour after each session.

00:01:45.098 --> 00:01:51.298
ECT is commonly used to treat severe cases
of major depression or bipolar disorder

00:01:51.298 --> 00:01:54.628
in patients who haven’t responded
to other therapies,

00:01:54.628 --> 00:01:57.948
or who have had adverse 
reactions to medication.

00:01:57.948 --> 00:02:01.888
Half or more of those who undergo 
treatment experience an improvement

00:02:01.888 --> 00:02:03.758
in their symptoms.

00:02:03.758 --> 00:02:09.368
Most patients treated with ECT have two or
three sessions per week for several weeks.

00:02:09.368 --> 00:02:13.908
Some begin to notice an improvement
in their symptoms after just one session,

00:02:13.908 --> 00:02:16.798
while others take longer to respond.

00:02:16.798 --> 00:02:21.178
Patients often continue less frequent
treatments for several months to a year,

00:02:21.178 --> 00:02:25.938
and some need occasional maintenance
sessions for the rest of their lives.

00:02:25.938 --> 00:02:28.568
Modern ECT is much safer than
it used to be,

00:02:28.568 --> 00:02:31.578
but patients can still 
experience side effects.

00:02:31.578 --> 00:02:36.108
They may feel achy, fatigued, 
or nauseated right after treatment.

00:02:36.108 --> 00:02:39.308
Some have trouble remembering what
happened right before a session—

00:02:39.308 --> 00:02:42.568
for example, what they had for 
dinner the previous evening.

00:02:42.568 --> 00:02:47.258
Rarely, they might have trouble 
remembering up to weeks and months before.

00:02:47.258 --> 00:02:51.698
For most patients, this memory
loss does improve over time.

00:02:51.698 --> 00:02:54.818
What's fascinating is that despite its 
proven track record,

00:02:54.818 --> 00:02:59.158
we still don't know exactly why ECT works.

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:02.048
Neurons in the brain communicate via
electrical signals,

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:06.668
which influence our brain chemistry, 
contributing to mood and behavior.

00:03:06.668 --> 00:03:12.418
The flood of electrical activity sparked
by ECT alters that chemistry.

00:03:12.418 --> 00:03:16.858
For example, ECT triggers the release
of certain neurotransmitters,

00:03:16.858 --> 00:03:21.168
molecules that help carry signals between
neurons and influence mental health.

00:03:21.178 --> 00:03:27.008
ECT also stimulates the flow of hormones
that may help reduce symptoms of depression.

00:03:27.008 --> 00:03:31.498
Interestingly, ECT maintenance works
better when paired with medication,

00:03:31.498 --> 00:03:35.158
even in patients who were
resistant to medication before.

00:03:35.158 --> 00:03:38.008
As we come to a better 
understanding of the brain,

00:03:38.008 --> 00:03:43.388
we’ll likely be able to make 
ECT even more effective.

00:03:43.388 --> 00:03:48.128
In 1995, more than a decade after
her first course of ECT,

00:03:48.128 --> 00:03:52.008
the nurse decided to publish an
account of her experience.

00:03:52.008 --> 00:03:53.998
Because of the stigma surrounding
the treatment,

00:03:53.998 --> 00:03:56.518
she worried that doing so
might negatively impact

00:03:56.518 --> 00:03:58.878
her personal and professional life,

00:03:58.878 --> 00:04:04.388
but she knew ECT could make a difference
for patients when all else failed.

00:04:04.388 --> 00:04:07.098
Though misperceptions about ECT persist,

00:04:07.098 --> 00:04:10.354
accounts like hers have helped make
doctors and patients alike

00:04:10.354 --> 00:04:14.344
aware of the treatment’s 
life changing potential.
