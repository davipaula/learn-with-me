00:00:13.047 --> 00:00:16.278
We love to engage
on the issues of the day.

00:00:16.302 --> 00:00:17.460
We love it.

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:18.942
We comment on the news,

00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:21.309
we post our views on social media,

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.071
we march, we protest ...

00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:27.850
But who among us is working on solutions,

00:00:27.874 --> 00:00:30.334
big solutions to big issues,

00:00:30.358 --> 00:00:32.270
like gun violence,

00:00:32.294 --> 00:00:34.029
mistreatment of workers,

00:00:34.053 --> 00:00:35.762
flood, famine, drought?

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:38.307
Who is on it?

00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:39.494
Boom!

00:00:40.781 --> 00:00:42.081
These guys.

00:00:42.105 --> 00:00:44.118
(Laughter)

00:00:44.142 --> 00:00:46.838
What? You were hoping for Peter Parker?

00:00:46.862 --> 00:00:48.290
The Avengers?

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:51.062
You don't expect this beacon of diversity,

00:00:51.086 --> 00:00:57.401
these good-looking, nicely dressed dudes
just oozing charisma to solve the issues?

00:00:57.425 --> 00:01:00.576
Well good, because they're actually
not going to solve the issues.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.944
But before you dismiss them,

00:01:03.968 --> 00:01:06.368
let me say, they're not going
to solve the issues,

00:01:06.392 --> 00:01:08.616
but they will show us how.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.842
So who are they?

00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.333
They're activist investors:

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.867
Carl Icahn, Dan Loeb,
Paul Singer, Barry Rosenstein.

00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:22.474
These are the modern-day
OGs of Wall Street.

00:01:22.498 --> 00:01:23.551
(Laughter)

00:01:23.575 --> 00:01:24.737
These are scary dudes.

00:01:24.761 --> 00:01:26.416
I don't mean Green Goblin scary.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.655
I mean real scary.

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:33.814
The fear they strike in the hearts
of a company's CEO and board

00:01:33.838 --> 00:01:35.697
when they enter its stock

00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:40.575
is the same fear you feel
when you hear a bear outside your tent,

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:41.842
and it's dark,

00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:44.398
and you're sitting there
with a mouthful of Doritos --

00:01:44.422 --> 00:01:45.483
(Laughter)

00:01:45.507 --> 00:01:46.661
that just moments ago,

00:01:46.685 --> 00:01:49.653
you had snuck out of the tent
to pull down from the bear hang,

00:01:49.677 --> 00:01:51.075
because you had the munchies.

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:52.570
That fear.

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:54.963
And in that moment, you are praying,

00:01:54.987 --> 00:01:58.373
"Oh Lord, please let this bear
be passing through."

00:01:58.397 --> 00:02:01.229
That bear is not passing through!

00:02:01.253 --> 00:02:04.017
That bear made a detour for you.

00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:06.042
Bears like Doritos!

00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:07.198
(Laughter)

00:02:07.222 --> 00:02:09.526
Activists like money.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.514
Some activists also like Doritos,
but they definitely want money.

00:02:16.313 --> 00:02:20.647
And the way they make money,
the way they create value,

00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:23.269
is by getting management of corporations

00:02:23.293 --> 00:02:24.909
to make changes.

00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:29.127
Now, some will argue
that the changes they create,

00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:31.789
the value they create,
is too short-term in nature.

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.106
And others will say the tactics
they use are egregious.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.544
I agree.

00:02:37.568 --> 00:02:39.280
Long, drawn-out lawsuits,

00:02:39.304 --> 00:02:40.788
public smear campaigns --

00:02:40.812 --> 00:02:43.152
there is no need for that.

00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:46.894
But I must say, there's
a small handful of activists,

00:02:46.918 --> 00:02:48.214
very small,

00:02:48.238 --> 00:02:51.174
that go to great lengths
to be constructive and collaborative.

00:02:51.198 --> 00:02:53.920
And overall, we have to give credit
where credit is due.

00:02:53.944 --> 00:02:57.790
As a group, they have managed
to catalyze large-scale change

00:02:57.814 --> 00:02:59.035
in large corporations,

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:01.278
and that's no small feat.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.824
Now, imagine a world

00:03:04.888 --> 00:03:07.948
where all investors were working
with management to make change,

00:03:07.972 --> 00:03:09.816
not just to make more money,

00:03:10.981 --> 00:03:13.924
but to improve
the environment and society.

00:03:13.948 --> 00:03:18.612
Imagine what a greener
and better world this would be.

00:03:18.636 --> 00:03:20.588
Now, why? Why would an investor bother?

00:03:20.612 --> 00:03:23.536
And at first, blush I'm with you:
Why would an investor care?

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.903
Because if doing well on ESG issues --

00:03:25.927 --> 00:03:28.712
environmental, social
and governance issues --

00:03:28.736 --> 00:03:31.401
was just an act of good
corporate citizenship,

00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:34.350
then I agree, investors would not care.

00:03:34.374 --> 00:03:35.817
But the good news,

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:39.019
and perhaps the saving grace
for our collective futures,

00:03:39.043 --> 00:03:42.757
is that it's so much more than
an act of good corporate citizenship.

00:03:43.376 --> 00:03:44.745
It's good business.

00:03:45.383 --> 00:03:48.143
There's now enough evidence
that shows a clear correlation

00:03:48.167 --> 00:03:51.373
between ESG performance
and financial performance.

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:54.604
Companies that do good
for the environment and society

00:03:54.628 --> 00:03:56.607
also do well financially.

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:59.807
And some of the best
companies are catching on.

00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:01.162
Like Adidas:

00:04:01.186 --> 00:04:05.108
Adidas is cleaning up the ocean
and making money in the process.

00:04:05.132 --> 00:04:09.332
Adidas teamed up with an organization
called Parley for the Oceans.

00:04:09.356 --> 00:04:12.893
Parley goes out and collects
plastic waste from the ocean.

00:04:12.917 --> 00:04:15.385
Adidas uses the plastic waste
to make shoes.

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.016
Shoes made with plastic from the ocean:

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.771
good for the environment
and good for business.

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.107
Because if you know that rapidly growing
consumer segment known as hipsters --

00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:27.363
and I know you know hipsters --

00:04:27.387 --> 00:04:31.000
then you know that a hipster faced with
the choice between a no-name shoe

00:04:31.024 --> 00:04:33.310
and an Adidas made with
plastic from the ocean

00:04:33.334 --> 00:04:37.308
will pick the Adidas every day
of the week and twice on Sunday,

00:04:37.332 --> 00:04:39.745
and then walk around like it's no big deal

00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:42.916
but look for every opportunity
to talk about them.

00:04:43.605 --> 00:04:45.415
Like, in an Uber Pool.

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:46.485
(Laughter)

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.120
"Hey, I noticed you looking at my feet."

00:04:49.144 --> 00:04:53.310
"What? Dude, no, I'm just making slides.
I'm a consultant. I make slides.

00:04:53.334 --> 00:04:55.684
I'm making PowerPoint slides,
I'm not looking --"

00:04:55.708 --> 00:04:56.876
"No, it's fine.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.303
I get why you'd be looking.

00:04:58.327 --> 00:05:00.431
The plastic on my shoe
must be bothering you.

00:05:00.455 --> 00:05:02.983
Well, let me talk about it
for the rest of this ride.

00:05:03.007 --> 00:05:05.417
You see, the plastic on my shoe
is from the ocean,

00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:07.592
on my feet, not in your fish,

00:05:07.616 --> 00:05:09.772
being walked on, not being munched on.

00:05:09.796 --> 00:05:12.319
Happy feet. Happy fish. Happy ocean.

00:05:12.343 --> 00:05:14.686
Doing my part. I got eco-shoes.
I got eco-shoes.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.539
You need some eco-shoes?"

00:05:16.563 --> 00:05:19.027
And so on, just cornering him.
We've all been there.

00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:21.925
"Hey, pass me your cell phone.
I'll give you a discount code.

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:23.556
Let me give you a discount code."

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.731
We've all been --

00:05:24.755 --> 00:05:26.903
Folks, I have jumped out
of moving Uber Pools.

00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:28.032
(Laughter)

00:05:28.056 --> 00:05:30.678
Just, moving, highway, I'm out. I'm out.

00:05:32.567 --> 00:05:35.854
But we've got to forgive the hipsters,
we need to love the hipsters.

00:05:35.878 --> 00:05:38.367
We need hipsters,
and we need companies like Adidas,

00:05:38.391 --> 00:05:41.891
and what we need most is for investors
to convince other companies

00:05:41.915 --> 00:05:43.527
to behave like Adidas.

00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:45.258
And herein lies the challenge.

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:49.863
There's a growing group of investors,
call them "conscious investors."

00:05:49.887 --> 00:05:52.657
Conscious investors care about ESG issues.

00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:57.978
And they talk a lot about
engaging management on ESG issues.

00:05:58.002 --> 00:06:00.647
But they don't actually get
management to make changes

00:06:00.671 --> 00:06:03.455
that will improve
the environment and society.

00:06:04.078 --> 00:06:07.654
And this is where conscious investors
can take a page from the playbook

00:06:07.678 --> 00:06:09.609
of the activist investors,

00:06:09.633 --> 00:06:13.550
because the activist investors have no
issues getting management to make changes.

00:06:13.574 --> 00:06:16.100
They have no issues turning up the heat.

00:06:16.124 --> 00:06:17.322
Take Paul Singer.

00:06:17.346 --> 00:06:19.689
He's an old-school Wall Street OG,

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:23.421
now in his 70s, loves Doritos,
loves making money.

00:06:24.474 --> 00:06:27.881
Argentina owed Paul 600 million dollars

00:06:27.905 --> 00:06:29.816
and would not pay.

00:06:30.386 --> 00:06:31.552
Big mistake.

00:06:31.576 --> 00:06:34.987
You can't take money from an OG
and not pay it back.

00:06:35.425 --> 00:06:37.872
Paul went to war with Argentina.

00:06:37.896 --> 00:06:39.990
I am not inventing.

00:06:40.014 --> 00:06:41.583
This is big. This was huge.

00:06:41.607 --> 00:06:44.246
This was bigger than Tyson vs Holyfield,

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.637
Ali vs Foreman.

00:06:45.661 --> 00:06:47.702
This was man vs country.

00:06:47.726 --> 00:06:52.473
Paul Singer started going around the world
trying to seize up Argentinian assets.

00:06:52.497 --> 00:06:57.162
At one point, he tried to seize
an Argentinian navy vessel

00:06:57.186 --> 00:06:58.440
off the coast of Ghana.

00:06:58.464 --> 00:07:01.900
He tried to take over a 350-foot ship

00:07:01.924 --> 00:07:05.842
while big navy officers
with big guns were on the ship.

00:07:05.866 --> 00:07:09.400
He got the police in Ghana
to show up with a crane

00:07:09.424 --> 00:07:10.903
and threaten to board the ship,

00:07:10.927 --> 00:07:15.439
and it wasn't until
the navy officers drew their weapons

00:07:15.463 --> 00:07:17.270
that they called off the operation.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.358
That's what I call turning up the heat.

00:07:20.382 --> 00:07:21.599
Now, you may say

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:24.773
Paul lost the battle.

00:07:24.797 --> 00:07:26.368
And I'll say, Paul won the war,

00:07:26.392 --> 00:07:28.232
because Paul didn't get paid one time,

00:07:28.256 --> 00:07:31.380
he got paid 20 times
his original investment.

00:07:32.831 --> 00:07:34.353
Then you have Barry Rosenstein.

00:07:34.377 --> 00:07:35.666
His fund, Jana Partners,

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.145
started stealth-mode buying up
stock in Whole Foods,

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:40.572
at a time when Whole Foods was struggling.

00:07:40.596 --> 00:07:42.496
They got to eight percent, came out,

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.276
and pushed Whole Foods
to sell itself to Amazon,

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.349
and not because Barry wanted
same-day delivery of his organic Doritos.

00:07:49.373 --> 00:07:50.404
(Laughter)

00:07:50.998 --> 00:07:52.984
He wanted to make some money.

00:07:53.008 --> 00:07:55.798
Now, the CEO of Whole Foods,
John Mackey, and the board

00:07:55.822 --> 00:08:00.030
did not want to sell themselves to Amazon,

00:08:00.054 --> 00:08:02.747
because that would be
the prime example of selling out.

00:08:03.275 --> 00:08:05.352
But in the end, they caved.

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:08.457
Why? Because Barry turned up the heat,

00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:11.328
and he made 300 million
dollars in the process.

00:08:11.777 --> 00:08:14.886
And he did not leave
a very nice impression on John.

00:08:15.605 --> 00:08:18.363
You're not going to see
John and Barry just hugging it out

00:08:18.387 --> 00:08:19.658
at the Whole Foods café.

00:08:20.765 --> 00:08:22.765
Let's take a very different example now:

00:08:23.524 --> 00:08:26.020
the Chicago Teachers' Pension Fund,

00:08:26.829 --> 00:08:29.358
a $10 billion conscious investor.

00:08:29.915 --> 00:08:32.846
They recently came out hard
against private prisons in the US,

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:34.235
and good for them.

00:08:34.259 --> 00:08:37.324
As a new parent, I tell you,
I am troubled by devastating images

00:08:37.348 --> 00:08:40.853
of young children being ripped
out of the arms of their parents

00:08:40.877 --> 00:08:42.061
at the US border

00:08:42.085 --> 00:08:45.571
and being placed in private
detention facilities that did too little

00:08:45.595 --> 00:08:48.752
to help the kids maintain
contact with their parents.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.360
So what did the Chicago teachers do?

00:08:52.459 --> 00:08:55.255
Did they get management to make changes?

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:56.544
Did they turn up the heat?

00:08:56.568 --> 00:08:58.687
Did they look management
in the eye and say,

00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:00.389
"This is no way to run a business.

00:09:01.044 --> 00:09:03.669
There's a different way
to do things. Let me show you"?

00:09:03.693 --> 00:09:07.123
No. They just sold their stock.

00:09:07.972 --> 00:09:09.428
Selling did nothing.

00:09:09.452 --> 00:09:11.829
It's not like management
woke up the next day

00:09:11.853 --> 00:09:13.306
and had an epiphany and said,

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.826
"Gosh, the teachers sold their stock.
We'd better be nice to the kids."

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.262
No. That didn't happen.

00:09:18.971 --> 00:09:22.952
And despite a decade
of several high-profile divestitures

00:09:22.976 --> 00:09:24.760
in private prison stock in the US,

00:09:24.784 --> 00:09:26.489
the stock has continued to climb.

00:09:26.513 --> 00:09:30.600
The stock over that same period
has outperformed the market.

00:09:31.941 --> 00:09:33.197
And the biggest issue is,

00:09:33.221 --> 00:09:36.818
we went from a set of conscious
investors owning the stock

00:09:36.842 --> 00:09:41.608
to it potentially being owned by investors
who don't care about these issues

00:09:41.632 --> 00:09:43.955
and don't care what you think
about these issues.

00:09:44.423 --> 00:09:46.994
And this is my issue
with conscious investors.

00:09:47.018 --> 00:09:49.151
Their MO is to divest

00:09:49.175 --> 00:09:51.825
or divert money into ESG-focused funds.

00:09:52.887 --> 00:09:56.190
You can't divest your way
to a greener world.

00:09:57.261 --> 00:09:59.579
You can divest your way
to a greener portfolio,

00:09:59.603 --> 00:10:01.222
not to a greener world.

00:10:02.722 --> 00:10:04.055
So what's it going to take?

00:10:04.079 --> 00:10:06.130
What's it going to take
to flip the script,

00:10:06.154 --> 00:10:09.006
to get conscious investors to go
from divesting to engaging,

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.508
to go from talking about engaging
to actually working with management

00:10:12.532 --> 00:10:16.557
to make changes that will improve
their ESG performance?

00:10:17.478 --> 00:10:20.376
Because there's a lot suggesting
they should and they could.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.473
They should, given the clear correlation
between ESG performance

00:10:23.497 --> 00:10:24.922
and financial performance.

00:10:25.877 --> 00:10:28.712
They could because the activists
have shown us they could.

00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:31.693
A shareholder can drive
change in a company.

00:10:31.717 --> 00:10:35.647
The difference is, Paul and Barry
do what they do to make money.

00:10:36.433 --> 00:10:41.532
The conscious investors would do it
to improve society and the environment

00:10:41.556 --> 00:10:43.309
and make money in the process

00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:46.330
and do it a little more
collaboratively and constructively.

00:10:47.245 --> 00:10:50.250
And they have the backing
of the some of the largest investors.

00:10:50.274 --> 00:10:53.263
Vanguard and BlackRock --
together, they manage trillions.

00:10:53.287 --> 00:10:56.699
They've been increasingly vocal
about the importance of ESG.

00:10:57.542 --> 00:11:01.526
The CEO of BlackRock has been
increasingly vocal in his annual letters

00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:02.881
about this issue.

00:11:03.512 --> 00:11:08.282
Even Jana Partners, the same OGs
that John called "greedy bastards,"

00:11:08.306 --> 00:11:10.971
recently co-wrote an open letter
to the board of Apple,

00:11:10.995 --> 00:11:14.122
saying, "Hey, your smartphones
are addictive for children.

00:11:14.969 --> 00:11:16.165
Fix it."

00:11:16.813 --> 00:11:18.467
Apple is working on it.

00:11:19.983 --> 00:11:22.204
So what it's going to take
is some pressure.

00:11:22.744 --> 00:11:25.349
It's going to take some pressure
on conscious investors

00:11:25.373 --> 00:11:28.200
to, in turn, put some pressure
on management

00:11:28.224 --> 00:11:32.477
to make changes that will improve
the environment and society.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.676
And where do they start?

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.511
They start by picking an issue
that matters to them

00:11:37.535 --> 00:11:38.837
and taking a stand on it.

00:11:39.376 --> 00:11:42.631
Take a stand on an issue
that lines up with your purpose:

00:11:43.313 --> 00:11:45.958
water preservation,
labor rights, diversity.

00:11:45.982 --> 00:11:48.820
As long as it lines up
with your purpose, you are golden.

00:11:49.393 --> 00:11:51.028
And the biggest unlock?

00:11:51.052 --> 00:11:56.019
Get the senior-most investment
professionals focused on this.

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.868
Today, when an activist
shows up to a campaign,

00:11:58.892 --> 00:12:02.351
it's the senior investment professional
talking to the CEO and the board

00:12:02.375 --> 00:12:03.825
and everyone hears about it.

00:12:03.849 --> 00:12:07.396
When a conscious investor shows up
to talk about an ESG issue,

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:09.861
it's some junior person
in the risk department

00:12:09.885 --> 00:12:13.055
talking to some junior person
in the investor relations department,

00:12:13.079 --> 00:12:15.633
and nobody hears about it,
and that needs to change.

00:12:15.657 --> 00:12:17.290
And it's not some massive leap.

00:12:17.314 --> 00:12:19.685
Today, when a company
underperforms financially,

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:20.877
who is on the hook?

00:12:20.901 --> 00:12:22.571
The senior investment professional.

00:12:22.595 --> 00:12:23.753
So what do they do?

00:12:23.777 --> 00:12:25.982
They drop everything
and work with management,

00:12:26.006 --> 00:12:27.718
collaboratively and constructively,

00:12:27.742 --> 00:12:31.246
to make changes to improve
the company's financial performance.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:34.935
The same should be true when the company
underperforms on ESG issues.

00:12:34.959 --> 00:12:38.697
And yes, that requires standardization
on how we measure ESG,

00:12:38.721 --> 00:12:39.907
but we're on it.

00:12:41.201 --> 00:12:43.143
So folks, here's my call to action:

00:12:43.766 --> 00:12:45.338
it's your money.

00:12:45.362 --> 00:12:46.871
It's your pension fund,

00:12:46.895 --> 00:12:48.724
it's your sovereign wealth fund.

00:12:48.748 --> 00:12:50.395
it's your university's endowment.

00:12:50.419 --> 00:12:51.771
It's your money.

00:12:51.795 --> 00:12:55.440
And it's your right to have your money
managed in line with your values.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:57.191
So use your voice

00:12:57.803 --> 00:12:59.318
and trust that it matters.

00:12:59.902 --> 00:13:03.735
It was your voice that got the investors
more conscious in the first place.

00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:05.684
You protested for years,

00:13:05.708 --> 00:13:08.634
because you didn't feel right
about your money being invested

00:13:08.658 --> 00:13:11.442
in companies whose values
don't line up with yours.

00:13:11.466 --> 00:13:13.349
It's time to use that voice again.

00:13:13.373 --> 00:13:15.691
But this time, instead of
pushing them to divest,

00:13:15.715 --> 00:13:19.249
push them to engage, truly engage,
truly work with management

00:13:19.273 --> 00:13:22.882
to make changes that will improve
their ESG performance.

00:13:24.449 --> 00:13:26.524
You made them aware of the issues.

00:13:26.548 --> 00:13:28.476
You can now focus them on fixing them.

00:13:29.074 --> 00:13:30.637
Thank you.

00:13:30.661 --> 00:13:33.041
(Applause)
