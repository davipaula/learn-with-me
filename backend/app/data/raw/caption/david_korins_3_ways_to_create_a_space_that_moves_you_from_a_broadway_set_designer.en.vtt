00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:14.461
You're sitting there,

00:00:14.485 --> 00:00:18.352
and it's incredibly frustrating.

00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:20.167
It's maddening.

00:00:20.192 --> 00:00:21.931
You've been sitting there for hours,

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.907
filling in those little tiny circles
with your No. 2 pencil --

00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:26.272
this is a standardized test.

00:00:26.296 --> 00:00:29.660
You look up, half-erased chalkboard,

00:00:29.684 --> 00:00:32.860
you can see that perfectly
written cursive alphabet,

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.576
the pull-down maps,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.461
you can hear, tick, tick, tick, ticking
on the wall, that industrial clock.

00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:45.741
But most importantly, you can feel
that oppressive fluorescent light,

00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:47.626
that death ray over your head.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.742
Bzzzzzz.

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.301
And you can't take it anymore,
but you don't have to,

00:00:52.325 --> 00:00:55.205
because Miss Darling says,
"OK, boys and girls, you're done."

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.731
So you jump up -- I mean, there is nothing
left of you but a vapor trail.

00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:02.511
You move so quickly, you slam
that little molded plastic chair,

00:01:02.535 --> 00:01:04.306
and you sprint down the hallway;

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.114
you go past the Lysol smell
and the BO smell and the cubbies,

00:01:08.138 --> 00:01:09.931
and you push the door --

00:01:09.955 --> 00:01:11.071
(Inhales deeply)

00:01:11.095 --> 00:01:12.675
and finally, you're outside.

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:15.888
Oh, you can feel the wind on your face,

00:01:15.912 --> 00:01:18.406
then the sun on your skin

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.589
and most importantly, the big blue sky.

00:01:22.776 --> 00:01:25.135
That is a revelation of space.

00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:30.951
Making revelations of space is what I do;
I'm a designer and creative director,

00:01:30.975 --> 00:01:32.605
and that's what I do for a living.

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:35.624
I do it for all sorts of people
in all kinds of different ways,

00:01:35.648 --> 00:01:37.754
and it might seem
complicated, but it's not.

00:01:37.778 --> 00:01:41.111
And over the next couple of minutes,
I'm going to give you three ways

00:01:41.135 --> 00:01:43.229
that I think you can
move through your world

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:46.753
so that you, too, can make revelations
of space, or at least reveal them.

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:49.746
Step one: therapy.

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:54.320
I know, I know, I know: blah, blah, blah,
New Yorker, blah, blah, blah, therapy.

00:01:54.344 --> 00:01:58.146
But seriously, therapy -- you have to know
why you're doing these things, right?

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.345
When I got the job
of designing "Hamilton,"

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.593
I sat with Lin-Manuel Miranda, writer,

00:02:02.617 --> 00:02:04.428
Tommy Kail, director, and I said,

00:02:04.452 --> 00:02:07.537
"Why are we telling
this 246-year-old story?

00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:10.114
What is it about the story
that you want to say,

00:02:10.138 --> 00:02:13.695
and what do you want people to feel like
when they experience the show?"

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:17.592
It's important. When we get that,
we move into step two: the design phase.

00:02:17.616 --> 00:02:19.894
And I'll give you
some little tricks about that,

00:02:19.918 --> 00:02:24.469
but the design phase is important
because we get to make these cool toys.

00:02:24.493 --> 00:02:27.086
I reach into Lin's brain,
he reaches into mine,

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.889
this monologue becomes a dialogue.

00:02:28.913 --> 00:02:30.220
And I make these cool toys,

00:02:30.244 --> 00:02:32.453
and I say, "Does this world
look like the world

00:02:32.477 --> 00:02:35.533
that you think could be a place
where we could house your show?"

00:02:35.557 --> 00:02:38.065
If the answer is yes --
and when the answer is yes --

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:41.247
we move into what I think
is the most terrifying part,

00:02:41.271 --> 00:02:42.984
which is the execution phase.

00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:45.633
The execution phase is when
we get to build this thing,

00:02:45.657 --> 00:02:50.086
and when this conversation goes
from a few people to a few hundred people

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.780
now translating this idea.

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:53.903
We put it in this beautiful little thing,

00:02:53.927 --> 00:02:56.786
put it in the "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
super-sizer machine

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.113
and blow it up full-scale,

00:02:58.137 --> 00:02:59.939
and we never know if we did it right

00:02:59.963 --> 00:03:02.798
until we show up onstage and go,
"Is it OK? Is it OK?"

00:03:02.822 --> 00:03:04.021
Here's the thing:

00:03:04.045 --> 00:03:05.452
you don't have to be Lin,

00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:08.791
you don't have to have a book
that you want to turn into a show

00:03:08.815 --> 00:03:10.641
in order to do this in your real life.

00:03:10.665 --> 00:03:13.922
You're already starring in a show,
by the way. It's called your life.

00:03:13.946 --> 00:03:15.289
Congratulations. (Laughter)

00:03:15.313 --> 00:03:18.411
But seriously, Shakespeare said it:
"All the world's a stage."

00:03:18.435 --> 00:03:19.599
He nailed that part.

00:03:19.623 --> 00:03:23.183
What he screwed up royally
was that part where he said,

00:03:23.207 --> 00:03:25.199
"And we are merely players."

00:03:25.223 --> 00:03:27.254
It's ridiculous. We're not merely players.

00:03:27.278 --> 00:03:30.123
We are the costume designers
and the lighting designers

00:03:30.147 --> 00:03:32.098
and the makeup artists in our own world,

00:03:32.122 --> 00:03:35.916
and I want to get you to think about
being the set designer in your world.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.026
Because I think you can leave here
if you do these three steps

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.097
and a couple of little tricks,
as I said, I'm going to tell you,

00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:44.978
and you can begin to change the world

00:03:45.002 --> 00:03:46.436
the way you want to.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.624
You want to do it?

00:03:47.648 --> 00:03:48.964
OK. Everybody write a show.

00:03:48.988 --> 00:03:49.994
(Laughter)

00:03:50.018 --> 00:03:51.171
No. Just kidding.

00:03:51.195 --> 00:03:54.240
OK. Step one: therapy. Right?

00:03:54.756 --> 00:03:56.437
How are you feeling?

00:03:56.461 --> 00:03:59.316
That's what the therapist says:
"How are you feeling today?"

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.340
It's important to remember that,
because when we design the world for you,

00:04:03.364 --> 00:04:05.751
the therapy is important.

00:04:05.775 --> 00:04:10.090
It tells you that emotion
is going to become light and color.

00:04:10.114 --> 00:04:14.218
A good example of that light and color

00:04:14.242 --> 00:04:16.473
is a show I designed called
"Dear Evan Hansen."

00:04:16.497 --> 00:04:17.512
(Cheers)

00:04:17.536 --> 00:04:19.497
"Dear Evan Hansen" exists -- oh my God --

00:04:19.521 --> 00:04:23.081
"Dear Evan Hansen" exists in a world
of almost all light and color.

00:04:23.105 --> 00:04:25.690
So I chose a color: inky-black darkness.

00:04:25.714 --> 00:04:26.749
(Laughter)

00:04:26.773 --> 00:04:31.613
Inky-black darkness is a color
the way that sadness is an emotion.

00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:35.898
And this show transforms people,
but not before it wrecks people.

00:04:35.922 --> 00:04:40.442
I bet you're wondering, "How expensive
could the set possibly be to transform you

00:04:40.466 --> 00:04:42.463
if you sit for two hours and 20 minutes

00:04:42.487 --> 00:04:43.895
in inky-black darkness?"

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:46.073
The answer is: cheap!

00:04:46.572 --> 00:04:47.920
Inky-black darkness,

00:04:48.735 --> 00:04:50.516
turn the lights on at the right time.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.153
Seriously, think about leaving
Miss Darling's class.

00:04:53.177 --> 00:04:55.977
Inky-black darkness gives way
at the right moment,

00:04:56.001 --> 00:05:00.895
we fly away that wall and reveal
a beautiful blue sky.

00:05:01.558 --> 00:05:03.684
It blows people away
and it transports them,

00:05:03.708 --> 00:05:05.200
and it makes them feel hopeful.

00:05:05.224 --> 00:05:07.430
And we know this because color is emotion,

00:05:07.454 --> 00:05:10.903
and when you paint with color,
you're painting with feelings.

00:05:12.033 --> 00:05:15.850
So think about that emotion, the one I had
you file away in your mental Rolodex.

00:05:15.874 --> 00:05:17.027
What color is it?

00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:20.603
Where in your wardrobe does it exist,
and where in your home does it exist?

00:05:20.627 --> 00:05:22.508
When we design the show for you,

00:05:22.532 --> 00:05:26.045
we're going to use that color
to tell you how you feel in certain times.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.905
But also, you know this exists
because you put the hero in white,

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:33.215
you put the lead character in red,
you put the villain in all black.

00:05:33.239 --> 00:05:35.280
It's typecasting. You know that.

00:05:35.304 --> 00:05:36.462
So think about it.

00:05:36.486 --> 00:05:39.208
But there's also something else
that happens in the world

00:05:39.232 --> 00:05:41.665
that helps us move through
the world in a safe way.

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:43.715
They're called architectural standards.

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:45.987
They make us not fall down and go boom.

00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:49.958
Doorknobs are all at the same height.
Light switches are all at the same height.

00:05:49.982 --> 00:05:52.792
Toilet bowls are always --
thank God -- at the same height,

00:05:52.816 --> 00:05:54.969
because no one ever
misses the toilet bowl.

00:05:54.993 --> 00:05:56.716
But seriously,

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.109
what would happen if we started
to tweak those architectural standards

00:06:00.133 --> 00:06:01.442
to get what we wanted?

00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:05.285
It reminds me of the stairs
I made for Pee-Wee Herman.

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:06.939
Pee-Wee Herman is a child,

00:06:06.963 --> 00:06:11.461
and his entire world is created
so that we perceive Pee-Wee as a child.

00:06:12.246 --> 00:06:16.030
The architecture and the furniture
and everything come to life,

00:06:16.054 --> 00:06:18.808
but nothing more important
than those stairs.

00:06:18.832 --> 00:06:21.119
Those stairs are 12 inches high,

00:06:21.143 --> 00:06:23.868
so when Pee-Wee clomps
up and down those stairs,

00:06:23.892 --> 00:06:26.075
he interacts with them like a kid.

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:28.319
You can't fake that kind of interaction,

00:06:28.343 --> 00:06:33.109
and that's the exact opposite
of what we ask people in opera to do.

00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:35.721
In opera, we shrink those stairs

00:06:35.745 --> 00:06:40.118
so that our main characters
can glide up and down effortlessly

00:06:40.142 --> 00:06:42.054
without ever breaking their voice.

00:06:42.078 --> 00:06:45.222
You could never put an opera singer
in Pee-Wee's Playhouse,

00:06:45.246 --> 00:06:48.463
(Sings in Pee-Wee's voice)
or they wouldn't be able to do their job.

00:06:48.487 --> 00:06:49.490
(Laughter)

00:06:49.514 --> 00:06:51.617
But you couldn't put Pee-Wee
in an opera set.

00:06:51.641 --> 00:06:53.649
He couldn't climb
up and down those stairs.

00:06:53.673 --> 00:06:54.828
There'd be no Pee-Wee.

00:06:54.852 --> 00:06:57.979
He'd be like James Bond slinking
elegantly up and down the stairs.

00:06:58.003 --> 00:06:59.160
It wouldn't work.

00:06:59.184 --> 00:07:00.201
(Laughter)

00:07:00.225 --> 00:07:03.587
Now think of your set, your home,
what you exist in every single day.

00:07:03.611 --> 00:07:06.544
If you're anything like me,
the trash can is just too small

00:07:06.568 --> 00:07:09.321
for the amount of takeout
that you buy every night, right?

00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:12.904
And I find myself jamming
like I'm kneading dough at a pizza place,

00:07:12.928 --> 00:07:15.568
I'm jamming it in
because I don't understand.

00:07:15.592 --> 00:07:18.305
Or, maybe the light switch in your foyer

00:07:18.329 --> 00:07:21.465
is just stashed behind too many
precariously placed coats,

00:07:21.489 --> 00:07:23.325
and so you don't even go for it.

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:25.525
Therefore, day after day,

00:07:25.549 --> 00:07:28.241
you wind up walking in and out
of a chasm of darkness.

00:07:28.265 --> 00:07:29.726
(Laughter)

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:30.906
It's true.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.296
But what would happen if the space
revealed something about yourself

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.733
that you didn't even know?

00:07:36.369 --> 00:07:40.609
Kanye never told me specifically
that he wanted to be God.

00:07:41.485 --> 00:07:42.636
But --

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.838
(Laughter)

00:07:43.862 --> 00:07:48.612
when we started working together,
we were sending images back and forth,

00:07:48.636 --> 00:07:50.872
and he sent me a picture
of the aurora borealis

00:07:50.896 --> 00:07:52.547
with lightning strikes through it.

00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:55.211
And he sent me pictures
from a mountaintop looking down

00:07:55.235 --> 00:07:57.344
at a smoke-filled canyon,

00:07:57.368 --> 00:07:59.826
or smoke underneath
the surface of water --

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:01.146
like, epic stuff.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.547
So the first set I designed for him
was a huge light box

00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:06.242
with the name of his record label.

00:08:06.266 --> 00:08:08.317
He would stand triumphantly
in front of it,

00:08:08.341 --> 00:08:10.603
and it would flash lights
like a lightning bolt.

00:08:10.627 --> 00:08:12.749
And it was epic, but, like,
starter-kit epic.

00:08:12.773 --> 00:08:15.821
We moved on to a large swath of sky
with a tear down the middle,

00:08:15.845 --> 00:08:19.967
and through the tear, you could see
deep parts of the cosmos.

00:08:19.991 --> 00:08:21.462
Getting closer.

00:08:21.486 --> 00:08:25.097
We evolved to standing
on top of an obelisk,

00:08:25.121 --> 00:08:27.980
standing on top of a mountainside,
standing on top of boxes.

00:08:28.004 --> 00:08:30.507
You know, he was evolving
as an artist through space,

00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:32.374
and it was my job to try and keep up.

00:08:32.398 --> 00:08:34.153
When we did Coachella,

00:08:34.177 --> 00:08:35.329
there he was,

00:08:35.353 --> 00:08:39.360
standing in front of an 80-foot-wide
by 40-foot-tall ancient artifact,

00:08:39.384 --> 00:08:41.751
literally handed down from God to man.

00:08:42.352 --> 00:08:45.114
He was evolving,
and we were all witness to it.

00:08:45.138 --> 00:08:48.332
And in his last show,
which I didn't design but I witnessed,

00:08:48.357 --> 00:08:49.849
he had self-actualized.

00:08:49.873 --> 00:08:54.203
He was literally standing
on a floating plexiglass deck

00:08:54.227 --> 00:08:56.260
over his adoring fans,

00:08:56.284 --> 00:09:01.495
who had no choice but to praise
to Yeezus up above.

00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:02.533
(Laughter)

00:09:02.557 --> 00:09:04.316
He had deified himself.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.717
You can't become Yeezus
in your living room.

00:09:06.741 --> 00:09:09.435
The space told him
who he was about himself,

00:09:09.459 --> 00:09:11.259
and then he delivered that to us.

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:13.604
When I was 20 years old,

00:09:13.628 --> 00:09:16.987
I was driving through a parking lot,
and I saw a puddle.

00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:20.469
I thought, "I'm going to veer to the left.
No -- I'm going through it."

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:23.954
And I hit the puddle, and -- ffftt! --
all the water underneath my car,

00:09:23.978 --> 00:09:25.904
and instantly, I have an aha moment.

00:09:26.463 --> 00:09:27.808
Light bulb goes off.

00:09:28.364 --> 00:09:30.591
Everything in the world
needs to be designed.

00:09:31.923 --> 00:09:35.131
I mean, I'm sure I was thinking,
"The drainage needs to be designed

00:09:35.155 --> 00:09:36.316
in this parking lot."

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.576
But then I was like, "Everything
in the world needs to be designed."

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.482
And it's true: left to its own devices,

00:09:41.506 --> 00:09:45.515
Mother Nature isn't going to carve
an interesting or necessarily helpful path

00:09:45.539 --> 00:09:46.823
for you.

00:09:47.569 --> 00:09:51.048
I've spent my career
reaching into people's minds

00:09:51.072 --> 00:09:55.007
and creating worlds out here
that we can all interact with.

00:09:56.309 --> 00:09:59.399
And yeah, you might not get
to do this with fancy collaborators,

00:09:59.423 --> 00:10:03.037
but I think if you leave here,
those three easy steps --

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:07.027
therapy, who do I want to be,
why do I do the things that I do;

00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:11.304
design, create a plan and try
and follow through with it,

00:10:11.328 --> 00:10:13.122
what can I do;

00:10:13.146 --> 00:10:14.419
execute it --

00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:17.657
I think if you add that
with a little color theory --

00:10:17.681 --> 00:10:18.687
(Laughter)

00:10:18.711 --> 00:10:23.162
some cool design choices and a general
disrespect for architectural standards,

00:10:23.186 --> 00:10:24.829
you can go out

00:10:24.853 --> 00:10:27.807
and create the world
that you want to live in,

00:10:27.831 --> 00:10:30.323
and I am going to go home
and buy a new trash can.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.929
Thank you.

00:10:31.953 --> 00:10:34.614
(Applause)
