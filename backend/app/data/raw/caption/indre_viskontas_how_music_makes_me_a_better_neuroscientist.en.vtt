00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:22.667
Music isn't music
until your brain makes it so.

00:00:23.893 --> 00:00:28.621
Sounds can be noise in one context
and music in another.

00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:33.652
We can all tell when someone is
speaking vs. when they're singing,

00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:39.085
but as Diana Deutsch discovered
if you take a spoken sentence,

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.131
pull out a phrase, repeat that phrase
over and over and over again,

00:00:43.132 --> 00:00:44.922
it will begin to sound musical.

00:00:45.752 --> 00:00:48.531
Then, if you listen
to the entire sentence again,

00:00:48.532 --> 00:00:51.992
it will sound as if the person
bursts into song

00:00:51.993 --> 00:00:54.662
when he or she gets to the repeated part.

00:00:55.532 --> 00:01:00.032
But the sounds reaching your ear
are the same in all of those cases;

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:02.741
what's changed is your brain.

00:01:02.742 --> 00:01:06.542
How the brain turns sound into music

00:01:06.543 --> 00:01:09.802
remains one of the greatest
mysteries of neuroscience.

00:01:10.972 --> 00:01:14.053
The vast majority of us
love some kind of music;

00:01:14.054 --> 00:01:17.658
If you don't, you are very rare
and scientists will want to study you.

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:21.959
We call you a person with "amusia"
- a cool new name.

00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:26.332
We don't all love the same music.

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.973
Personally, I'm not
a huge fan of smooth jazz,

00:01:28.974 --> 00:01:31.253
and you might not like opera.

00:01:31.254 --> 00:01:32.913
This characteristic of music,

00:01:32.914 --> 00:01:37.202
the fact that it's universally loved,
but highly subjective,

00:01:37.203 --> 00:01:40.313
has ensured
that it continues to baffle us.

00:01:41.923 --> 00:01:44.953
We all need certain things
to survive and reproduce:

00:01:44.954 --> 00:01:46.325
food, water, sex.

00:01:46.326 --> 00:01:48.303
Our minds have evolved in such a way

00:01:48.304 --> 00:01:51.287
that when we don't have those things,
we seek them out.

00:01:51.288 --> 00:01:52.754
They become enjoyable;

00:01:52.755 --> 00:01:55.751
we call them "biological reinforcers."

00:01:55.755 --> 00:01:59.724
But music is just a bunch
of sounds strung together,

00:02:00.474 --> 00:02:03.244
it doesn't provide us
with the essential nutrients;

00:02:03.245 --> 00:02:06.542
it doesn't bind to our neurons
the way drugs do;

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:11.013
it doesn't ensure that our genes live on
although that might be debatable.

00:02:12.513 --> 00:02:14.103
Why do we love music?

00:02:14.104 --> 00:02:17.163
It's a question I've struggled to answer,

00:02:17.164 --> 00:02:21.103
and I can't promise you
a full, complete solution today,

00:02:21.104 --> 00:02:24.054
but I like to share with you
some of the scientific insights

00:02:24.055 --> 00:02:26.214
that had made me a better musician,

00:02:26.215 --> 00:02:27.850
and some of the artistic insights

00:02:27.851 --> 00:02:31.821
I hope will help neuroscientists
solve this mystery.

00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:35.293
I come from a family of physicians:

00:02:35.294 --> 00:02:38.292
two anesthesiologists,
a gastroenterologist,

00:02:38.294 --> 00:02:43.109
a generalist, an orthopedic surgeon,
an ophthalmic surgeon, and an ER doctor.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.814
Thanksgiving dinner at our house

00:02:44.815 --> 00:02:47.624
is the safest place to be
outside of the hospital.

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:49.384
(Laughter)

00:02:49.385 --> 00:02:51.536
so I can't guarantee it's the most fun.

00:02:53.316 --> 00:02:55.734
Then there is my mother;

00:02:55.735 --> 00:02:57.484
she is a conductor,

00:02:57.485 --> 00:02:59.865
much to my two-year old son's dismay,

00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:04.395
not of the locomotive kind
but very much of the music kind.

00:03:05.495 --> 00:03:09.375
Growing up, I saw how difficult it is
to make a living as a musician

00:03:09.376 --> 00:03:14.618
in a society where music is universally
loved but hopelessly undervalued.

00:03:15.418 --> 00:03:18.685
She works long hours,
she still sacrifices every holiday,

00:03:18.686 --> 00:03:21.395
and there is a part of her
that never stops wondering

00:03:21.396 --> 00:03:23.666
what people thought
of her last performance.

00:03:24.406 --> 00:03:27.776
If you count up all the awards,
the recognitions, and distinctions,

00:03:27.777 --> 00:03:30.784
she's by far, the most
successful member of our family,

00:03:30.785 --> 00:03:33.375
but she certainly wouldn't think so.

00:03:33.376 --> 00:03:36.315
Not that being a doctor
isn't stressful - it is -

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:37.886
but at the end of the day,

00:03:37.887 --> 00:03:42.266
you've spent your time trying
to extend or enhance a person's life,

00:03:42.267 --> 00:03:45.696
and who can argue the value of that?

00:03:45.697 --> 00:03:48.999
So when it was my turn to decide
what to do with my professional life,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.070
the choice seemed pretty straight forward:
go to medical school,

00:03:52.071 --> 00:03:56.406
and in your free time, continue up
your musical training.

00:03:56.407 --> 00:03:59.723
But then I watched my brother trained
to become an orthopedic surgeon,

00:03:59.724 --> 00:04:02.856
and I realized there is no such thing
as free time in med school

00:04:02.857 --> 00:04:04.777
and especially in the years that follow.

00:04:05.517 --> 00:04:09.848
I didn't want to give up the most
important years of my vocal training.

00:04:10.257 --> 00:04:11.546
I also couldn't see

00:04:11.547 --> 00:04:14.966
how I could support myself and pay
for those expensive singing lessons

00:04:14.967 --> 00:04:17.278
if I didn't have some other way
to make money.

00:04:18.148 --> 00:04:20.357
So I turned to neuroscience.

00:04:20.358 --> 00:04:23.657
To me, it was the a perfect blend
of science and poetry.

00:04:23.658 --> 00:04:26.916
Like pretty much every other
neuroscientist of my generation,

00:04:26.917 --> 00:04:29.467
I devoured the writings of Oliver Sacks;

00:04:29.468 --> 00:04:30.639
I studied topics

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.269
like autobiographical memory,
analogical reasoning, creativity.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.559
So you'd think then I'd turn to science
to help me become a better musician.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.758
After all, if I was using science

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.018
to understand something
as elusive as insight,

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:50.438
wouldn't it make sense to turn there
to learn the things that I loved?

00:04:51.248 --> 00:04:54.488
But the truth is the more I looked
at anatomical drawings

00:04:54.489 --> 00:04:57.227
of the larynx, the tongue,
and the diaphragm,

00:04:57.228 --> 00:05:00.497
the less I felt I understood
about my instrument;

00:05:00.498 --> 00:05:01.577
I couldn't see

00:05:01.578 --> 00:05:05.328
how knowing what parts of the brain
were active or even enhanced in musicians

00:05:05.329 --> 00:05:06.899
would make me sing better.

00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:11.288
For a while, I even tried very hard
to give up singing,

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.148
because, after all, there are
so many great singers in the world.

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:18.349
We all need to get
one-on-one care from a physician,

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.779
but many hundreds of thousands of us
can be moved by the same musician.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.001
So wouldn't I, and maybe the world, be
better off if I stuck to medical research?

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.498
The problem was that the more time I let
elapse between singing engagements,

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:37.728
the more I felt there was something
really important missing from my life.

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.058
The more I felt that I couldn't be
the person I needed to be,

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:46.260
I became moody, irritable,
a little irrational, often mean;

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.518
and I found too often I would cap off
a difficult day in the lab

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:53.620
with a martini or two
and an hour of self-loathing.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.399
So when I finished my neuroscience PhD,

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.939
I decided to dedicate myself
full time to music;

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.778
I enrolled in a Master's of Music program.

00:06:04.258 --> 00:06:07.278
Classical musical training
follows the apprenticeship model

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:10.220
where you study with one
or two teachers for many years

00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:13.962
until you can produce the sounds
that you hear in your imagination

00:06:13.963 --> 00:06:15.472
on your instrument.

00:06:15.473 --> 00:06:18.390
But the one thing that kept gnawing at me
over and over again

00:06:18.391 --> 00:06:22.179
was how little neuroscience
had trickled down into this model.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.199
After all, most of the techniques
are built upon

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.989
performing the same exercises
over and over and over again,

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.990
often, in the same way, everyday;
until you build those skills.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.101
To demonstrate this, I want to introduce
to you one of my favorite collaborators,

00:06:36.102 --> 00:06:37.625
Keisuke Nakagoshi.

00:06:38.851 --> 00:06:40.221
(Applause)

00:06:46.646 --> 00:06:48.740
Keisuke is going to give us an example

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:51.761
of what a typical piano training
exercise sounds like.

00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:54.861
(Piano music starts)

00:07:03.202 --> 00:07:04.722
(Piano music ends)

00:07:05.261 --> 00:07:07.714
Over and over and over again!

00:07:08.684 --> 00:07:11.661
But the truth is if you want
to take what you're learning,

00:07:11.662 --> 00:07:15.602
what you're developing in that skill,
and apply it to any piece of music,

00:07:15.603 --> 00:07:17.411
research in motor learning suggests

00:07:17.412 --> 00:07:20.601
that you should in fact interleave
and space out your trials

00:07:20.602 --> 00:07:24.112
introducing some randomness
- what we call "desirable difficulties."

00:07:24.113 --> 00:07:27.862
There is even a study of pianists
demonstrating this effect,

00:07:27.863 --> 00:07:30.515
but so many teachers
have never heard of such a thing.

00:07:31.505 --> 00:07:32.750
So then I began to wonder,

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.642
"What would happen
if I actually try it on myself?"

00:07:35.643 --> 00:07:38.091
as most scientists
use themselves as guinea pigs,

00:07:38.092 --> 00:07:40.754
and I found that I started
to improve much more rapidly.

00:07:41.754 --> 00:07:44.542
So I developed a course
called Training the Musical Brain;

00:07:44.543 --> 00:07:48.098
how to use neuroscience to develop
more effective practice strategies

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:51.803
which I now teach at the Conservatory
of Music here in San Francisco.

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:53.732
I started to wonder,

00:07:53.733 --> 00:07:56.882
"Are there other ways
that science can make me a better musician

00:07:56.883 --> 00:07:58.703
that I couldn't see ten years ago?"

00:08:00.263 --> 00:08:03.542
When I was a child,
I remember one of my evaluations

00:08:03.543 --> 00:08:06.002
at the Royal Conservatory of Music;

00:08:06.003 --> 00:08:07.883
it'll always stick with me.

00:08:07.884 --> 00:08:11.981
I was a kid, I sang all my pieces well,
I didn't make any mistakes,

00:08:11.982 --> 00:08:16.563
the judges said my tone was very good,
I had good technique,

00:08:16.564 --> 00:08:19.534
but my performance was deemed "unmusical."

00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:22.000
I was devastated.

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:24.173
How could these judges
gauge my musicality?

00:08:24.174 --> 00:08:28.603
Couldn't they see that I feel
and understand this music deeply?

00:08:28.604 --> 00:08:33.863
But the truth is feeling the music
and producing music other people feel

00:08:33.864 --> 00:08:35.683
are two different skills.

00:08:36.323 --> 00:08:37.602
In the rehearsal room,

00:08:37.604 --> 00:08:40.602
I can cry as much as I need to
when my character is dying,

00:08:40.604 --> 00:08:44.043
but when I get on stage,
it's your time to cry not mine.

00:08:44.044 --> 00:08:46.984
So what could science tell me about that?

00:08:49.004 --> 00:08:51.413
That's when my two worlds collided;

00:08:51.414 --> 00:08:55.212
because after all, art and science
are after the same thing:

00:08:55.213 --> 00:08:58.375
the goal is to understand
the human experience.

00:08:59.055 --> 00:09:02.243
Science does it by extracting
general principles about the world,

00:09:02.244 --> 00:09:06.545
and art uses individual experience
to highlight what's universal.

00:09:07.725 --> 00:09:09.895
So here is what I learned in a nutshell:

00:09:10.815 --> 00:09:13.067
your brain is primed
to search for meaning,

00:09:13.068 --> 00:09:16.957
for patterns, in a random, chaotic world.

00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.855
We look for these things everywhere,

00:09:18.856 --> 00:09:20.385
and we've evolved in such a way

00:09:20.386 --> 00:09:22.844
that it's enjoyable
when we make a new connection,

00:09:22.845 --> 00:09:26.292
when we learn something new,
when we understand something meaningful.

00:09:26.293 --> 00:09:27.915
We find pleasure in it.

00:09:28.845 --> 00:09:32.204
We see things that are meaningful to us
even when they are not there.

00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:35.565
We see faces everywhere;
they are important to us.

00:09:35.584 --> 00:09:38.460
We anthropomorphize
or attribute human-like traits

00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:41.566
to our pets, or cars, or digital devices.

00:09:43.136 --> 00:09:46.608
When we hear repeated sounds,
and we know what they mean,

00:09:46.609 --> 00:09:47.789
we call it music.

00:09:48.649 --> 00:09:51.785
Speech becomes song just by repetition.

00:09:51.786 --> 00:09:54.335
In fact, repetition
is the one quality of music

00:09:54.336 --> 00:09:57.345
that seems to be common
across all cultures and genres,

00:09:58.125 --> 00:10:01.325
even in the one genre
in which it's explicitly avoided

00:10:01.326 --> 00:10:04.754
- we call this classical contemporary
music composition."

00:10:04.755 --> 00:10:06.293
Elizabeth Margulis found

00:10:06.296 --> 00:10:09.975
if you artificially insert
repetition into these pieces,

00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:15.175
people find them more enjoyable,
more interesting, more likely to be rated

00:10:15.176 --> 00:10:19.616
as having been composed
by a human being rather than a computer.

00:10:20.346 --> 00:10:21.476
Why?

00:10:22.141 --> 00:10:27.400
Because repetition signals intention,
it frames the pattern,

00:10:27.401 --> 00:10:30.547
it shows you that there is something
meaningful here to listen to.

00:10:31.217 --> 00:10:34.555
But that's not enough
to explain a human obsession.

00:10:34.556 --> 00:10:38.687
After all, music can cause riots,
topple governments,

00:10:38.688 --> 00:10:41.697
raise the hairs on the back of your neck.

00:10:41.698 --> 00:10:44.219
What can science tell us about that?

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:50.627
It turns out that when your brain
is enjoying a piece of music

00:10:50.628 --> 00:10:52.668
that might even give you the chills,

00:10:52.669 --> 00:10:55.610
it's awash with a neurotransmitter
called dopamine.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:00.387
Dopamine, despite its widespread fame,
has actually been undersold in many ways;

00:11:00.388 --> 00:11:02.857
people think of it
as the "pleasure chemical,"

00:11:02.858 --> 00:11:04.857
but that's not all it does.

00:11:04.858 --> 00:11:08.376
A better term for it
is the "salience chemical,"

00:11:08.377 --> 00:11:10.886
because it's awash
in some parts of your brain

00:11:10.887 --> 00:11:13.625
when you're trying to hold
important things in mind,

00:11:13.626 --> 00:11:17.187
when you're nauseated,
when you want something,

00:11:17.188 --> 00:11:20.090
when there is a meaning to be found.

00:11:20.091 --> 00:11:24.287
The way that dopamine's awash in the brain
while you're getting the chills from music

00:11:24.288 --> 00:11:27.374
is very specific
to when and where it happens.

00:11:27.375 --> 00:11:31.001
There's a paper from Robert Zatorre's lab
at McGill with Valorie Salimpoor,

00:11:31.002 --> 00:11:33.696
the first author
that documents these changes

00:11:33.697 --> 00:11:36.749
and showed me, finally,
what it means to be musical.

00:11:37.769 --> 00:11:42.707
Even as a master's student, I self-doubted
my ability to sing musically;

00:11:42.708 --> 00:11:44.619
it was a bit like being cool:

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:47.276
everyone seemed to know
what it was and how to do it,

00:11:47.277 --> 00:11:50.518
but if you even asked the question,
it showed that you weren't cool.

00:11:51.218 --> 00:11:53.596
I guess the fact
I turned to science for help

00:11:53.597 --> 00:11:55.658
puts the nail in the coffin
of my coolness.

00:11:55.659 --> 00:11:57.248
(Laughter)

00:11:57.249 --> 00:11:58.828
Even though in the practice room,

00:11:58.948 --> 00:12:01.738
I'd spend almost all my time
perfecting my high notes,

00:12:01.739 --> 00:12:03.858
after all, that's what gets you hired.

00:12:03.859 --> 00:12:05.650
They come at the climax of the piece;

00:12:05.651 --> 00:12:07.919
they get the biggest reaction
from the audience;

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.818
and if you screw them up,
they are the most memorable.

00:12:10.819 --> 00:12:12.688
But my singing teacher would say to me,

00:12:12.689 --> 00:12:15.379
"It's all the notes
that are leading up to the high note

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.429
that are more important
than the high note,

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.229
and that's what you should practice."

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:20.044
I understood that

00:12:20.045 --> 00:12:22.663
from a technical perspective
but not from a musical one

00:12:22.664 --> 00:12:24.752
until I read the Salimpoor paper.

00:12:24.762 --> 00:12:28.391
In the Salimpoor paper, they show

00:12:28.392 --> 00:12:32.389
that there are two regions of the brain
that mediate getting the chills from music

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.491
and they tracked dopamine
in these regions.

00:12:34.501 --> 00:12:36.905
They are the caudate
and the nucleus accumbens.

00:12:36.906 --> 00:12:39.188
You can think of the caudate
as your parent:

00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:42.510
it tells you that your behavior
has consequences,

00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:47.701
it tracks how the things that you see,
hear, observe, and do have outcomes;

00:12:48.411 --> 00:12:53.368
it sets up the expectation of a reward
of pleasure and ensures, in the future,

00:12:53.369 --> 00:12:55.998
you will behave in such a way
that you will seek reward

00:12:55.999 --> 00:12:58.790
and avoid the things
that led to punishment.

00:12:58.791 --> 00:13:01.730
The caudate is awash with dopamine

00:13:01.731 --> 00:13:04.270
when you are leading up
to the special moment

00:13:04.271 --> 00:13:05.750
that will give you the chills.

00:13:05.751 --> 00:13:08.474
But when you get to the moment
that give you the chills,

00:13:08.475 --> 00:13:11.260
there is a dopamine spike
in your nucleus accumbens.

00:13:11.792 --> 00:13:15.459
Your nucleus accumbens is your BFF,
it's your best friend for life,

00:13:15.472 --> 00:13:18.320
because more dopamine
in the nucleus accumbens

00:13:18.321 --> 00:13:20.500
correlates with a bigger high.

00:13:20.501 --> 00:13:23.740
In the 1950s,
Olds and Milner stuck electrodes

00:13:23.741 --> 00:13:27.030
into the nucleus accumbens
of a bunch of rats.

00:13:27.031 --> 00:13:29.399
Then, they taught those rats
to press the lever;

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.941
and every time they pressed the lever,
they'd get a little electric current

00:13:32.942 --> 00:13:35.021
that stimulates their nucleus accumbens.

00:13:35.022 --> 00:13:38.432
Those rats wanted nothing more
than to press that lever.

00:13:38.433 --> 00:13:43.231
One rat pressed it
7,500 times in 12 hours,

00:13:43.232 --> 00:13:46.753
suggesting that it would starve
rather than stop pressing.

00:13:47.131 --> 00:13:52.400
The nucleus accumbens likes,
but the caudate wants.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.928
The intensity of the chills
that you feel from music depends

00:13:56.929 --> 00:14:00.378
on how much dopamine there is
in your nucleus accumbens,

00:14:00.379 --> 00:14:04.390
but the number of times you get the chills
or, if you get them at all, depends

00:14:04.391 --> 00:14:07.140
on the amount of dopamine
in your caudate.

00:14:07.141 --> 00:14:10.770
That's what I learned,
that's what it means to be musical.

00:14:10.771 --> 00:14:15.032
You need to set up
the musical intention for your audience

00:14:15.033 --> 00:14:16.629
so that they will pay attention,

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.400
so that the caudate will know

00:14:18.401 --> 00:14:22.561
that there is a reward to be had,
and we better pay attention.

00:14:22.562 --> 00:14:23.871
Then, as a musician,

00:14:23.872 --> 00:14:26.791
you use all kinds of tools,
once you've set up the tension,

00:14:26.792 --> 00:14:29.371
to delay it, to delay the release.

00:14:29.372 --> 00:14:33.439
There's all kinds of music tools
you can use to increase the desire,

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.280
the expectation,
the motivation for the reward,

00:14:36.281 --> 00:14:38.922
because, after all,
pleasure is the death of desire.

00:14:38.923 --> 00:14:41.459
But the more desire there is,
the better the pleasure.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.543
That's what I learned.

00:14:43.544 --> 00:14:47.721
So let me demonstrate to you
this little theory in practice.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:52.542
One of my favorite opera
is "La Traviata" by Verdi.

00:14:52.546 --> 00:14:55.839
It tells the story of a Parisian
courtesan, a high class prostitute,

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.091
who is dying of tuberculosis,
as lots of sopranos do.

00:14:59.511 --> 00:15:01.021
(Laughter)

00:15:01.022 --> 00:15:05.020
She is entertaining a lavish party
because she's giving everybody pleasure.

00:15:05.021 --> 00:15:07.972
That's what she does for a living,
she gives pleasure,

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:10.301
and she gets exhausted by the party;

00:15:10.302 --> 00:15:14.771
but at the party, she meets this young man
who has been sitting outside her window

00:15:14.772 --> 00:15:19.681
while she was ill, unable to give pleasure
when all her friends had abandoned her,

00:15:19.682 --> 00:15:22.761
and he was waiting for her
because he really loved her.

00:15:22.762 --> 00:15:28.013
And now, alone in her room, she wonders,
"What would it be like to feel true love?"

00:15:28.014 --> 00:15:33.024
"What is this mysterious thing,
this pulse of the universe?"

00:15:34.044 --> 00:15:37.829
She realizes
that it's a double-edged sword,

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:40.953
that love is both torture and delight,

00:15:40.959 --> 00:15:42.993
(Italian) "croce e delizia."

00:15:42.994 --> 00:15:46.503
That's the intention I want
to communicate to you, musically,

00:15:46.504 --> 00:15:50.272
because, of course, the idea is
much more complicated than we can say.

00:15:50.273 --> 00:15:53.953
In order to do that,
I'll first sing a repeat

00:15:53.954 --> 00:15:56.243
of what the tenor's saying
earlier in the act.

00:15:56.244 --> 00:15:57.243
Clever Verdi!

00:15:57.244 --> 00:16:00.102
We like things better
the second time around; repetition.

00:16:00.103 --> 00:16:02.314
Then I will set up the expectation,

00:16:02.315 --> 00:16:04.892
I'll tell you straight off,
there will be a high note

00:16:04.893 --> 00:16:05.853
- Setting that up? -

00:16:05.854 --> 00:16:08.394
but I will delay that high note
as long as possible

00:16:08.395 --> 00:16:11.603
to increase your motivation
to get dopamine into your caudates,

00:16:11.604 --> 00:16:14.813
so that by the time we relax that tension,

00:16:14.814 --> 00:16:17.773
there is a dopamine spike
in your nucleus accumbens.

00:16:17.774 --> 00:16:19.054
(Laughter)

00:16:21.774 --> 00:16:23.594
(Piano music starts)

00:16:26.034 --> 00:16:27.514
(Singing)

00:17:55.544 --> 00:17:57.995
(Singing and piano music end)

00:17:58.963 --> 00:18:00.573
(Applause)
