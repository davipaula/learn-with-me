00:00:07.525 --> 00:00:09.815
In 132 CE,

00:00:09.815 --> 00:00:12.145
Chinese polymath Zhang Heng

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:15.585
presented the Han court with 
his latest invention.

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:17.675
This large vase, he claimed,

00:00:17.675 --> 00:00:21.325
could tell them whenever an earthquake 
occurred in their kingdom–

00:00:21.325 --> 00:00:24.595
including the direction 
they should send aid.

00:00:24.595 --> 00:00:26.505
The court was somewhat skeptical,

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:31.005
especially when the device triggered 
on a seemingly quiet afternoon.

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:34.054
But when messengers came 
for help days later,

00:00:34.054 --> 00:00:36.614
their doubts turned to gratitude.

00:00:36.614 --> 00:00:41.114
Today, we no longer rely on pots to 
identify seismic events,

00:00:41.114 --> 00:00:46.150
but earthquakes still offer a unique
challenge to those trying to track them.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.139
So why are earthquakes so 
hard to anticipate,

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:52.039
and how could we get better 
at predicting them?

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:53.099
To answer that,

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:57.539
we need to understand some theories 
behind how earthquakes occur.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.794
Earth’s crust is made from several vast, 
jagged slabs of rock

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:03.749
called tectonic plates,

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:08.479
each riding on a hot, partially molten
layer of Earth’s mantle.

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.289
This causes the plates to 
spread very slowly,

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.839
at anywhere from 1 to 20 
centimeters per year.

00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:17.289
But these tiny movements are powerful 
enough

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.799
to cause deep cracks in the
interacting plates.

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.399
And in unstable zones,

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.219
the intensifying pressure may 
ultimately trigger an earthquake.

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.249
It’s hard enough to monitor these 
miniscule movements,

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:35.589
but the factors that turn shifts into 
seismic events are far more varied.

00:01:35.589 --> 00:01:38.399
Different fault lines juxtapose 
different rocks–

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.269
some of which are stronger–or weaker–
under pressure.

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:46.979
Diverse rocks also react differently to
friction and high temperatures.

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.431
Some partially melt, and can release
lubricating fluids

00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:52.230
made of superheated minerals

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.420
that reduce fault line friction.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.370
But some are left dry,

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.140
prone to dangerous build-ups of pressure.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.680
And all these faults are subject to 
varying gravitational forces,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.531
as well as the currents of hot rocks
moving throughout Earth’s mantle.

00:02:08.531 --> 00:02:11.755
So which of these hidden variables 
should we be analyzing,

00:02:11.755 --> 00:02:15.955
and how do they fit into our 
growing prediction toolkit?

00:02:15.955 --> 00:02:19.829
Because some of these forces occur 
at largely constant rates,

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.159
the behavior of the plates 
is somewhat cyclical.

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.609
Today, many of our most reliable clues 
come from long-term forecasting,

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.893
related to when and where earthquakes 
have previously occurred.

00:02:31.893 --> 00:02:33.573
At the scale of millennia,

00:02:33.573 --> 00:02:37.533
this allows us to make predictions 
about when highly active faults,

00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:38.873
like the San Andreas,

00:02:38.873 --> 00:02:41.943
are overdue for a massive earthquake.

00:02:41.943 --> 00:02:44.193
But due to the many variables involved,

00:02:44.193 --> 00:02:47.783
this method can only predict 
very loose timeframes.

00:02:47.783 --> 00:02:49.693
To predict more imminent events,

00:02:49.693 --> 00:02:55.303
researchers have investigated the 
vibrations Earth elicits before a quake.

00:02:55.303 --> 00:02:57.990
Geologists have long used seismometers

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.920
to track and map these tiny shifts
in the earth’s crust.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.910
And today, most smartphones are 
also capable

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.670
of recording primary seismic waves.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.740
With a network of phones around the globe,

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.680
scientists could potentially 
crowdsource a rich,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.945
detailed warning system that alerts 
people to incoming quakes.

00:03:16.945 --> 00:03:21.325
Unfortunately, phones might not be able
to provide the advance notice needed

00:03:21.325 --> 00:03:23.355
to enact safety protocols.

00:03:23.355 --> 00:03:26.075
But such detailed readings 
would still be useful

00:03:26.075 --> 00:03:29.425
for prediction tools like NASA’s 
Quakesim software,

00:03:29.425 --> 00:03:32.255
which can use a rigorous blend of 
geological data

00:03:32.255 --> 00:03:34.765
to identify regions at risk.

00:03:34.765 --> 00:03:36.765
However, recent studies indicate

00:03:36.765 --> 00:03:41.635
the most telling signs of a quake might be
invisible to all these sensors.

00:03:41.635 --> 00:03:43.005
In 2011,

00:03:43.005 --> 00:03:46.265
just before an earthquake struck 
the east coast of Japan,

00:03:46.265 --> 00:03:50.065
nearby researchers recorded surprisingly 
high concentrations

00:03:50.065 --> 00:03:54.425
of the radioactive isotope pair: 
radon and thoron.

00:03:54.425 --> 00:03:58.167
As stress builds up in the crust right 
before an earthquake,

00:03:58.167 --> 00:04:02.407
microfractures allow these gases 
to escape to the surface.

00:04:02.407 --> 00:04:07.042
These scientists think that if we built 
a vast network of radon-thoron detectors

00:04:07.042 --> 00:04:08.992
in earthquake-prone areas,

00:04:08.992 --> 00:04:11.522
it could become a promising 
warning system–

00:04:11.522 --> 00:04:14.532
potentially predicting quakes 
a week in advance.

00:04:14.532 --> 00:04:15.232
Of course,

00:04:15.232 --> 00:04:17.432
none of these technologies 
would be as helpful

00:04:17.432 --> 00:04:20.572
as simply looking deep inside 
the earth itself.

00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:22.242
With a deeper view we might be able

00:04:22.242 --> 00:04:26.852
to track and predict large-scale 
geological changes in real time,

00:04:26.852 --> 00:04:30.024
possibly saving tens of thousands 
of lives a year.

00:04:30.024 --> 00:04:30.874
But for now,

00:04:30.874 --> 00:04:35.404
these technologies can help us prepare 
and respond quickly to areas in need–

00:04:35.404 --> 00:04:39.462
without waiting for directions 
from a vase.
