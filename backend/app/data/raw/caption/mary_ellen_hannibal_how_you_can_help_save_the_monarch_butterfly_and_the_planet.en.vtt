00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.375
Hi there.

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:18.545
I'm in the habit of saying
I would like it if butterflies could talk,

00:00:18.569 --> 00:00:20.710
but I've been recently reconsidering that,

00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:23.250
because we already have
a pretty loud world.

00:00:23.274 --> 00:00:27.766
Can you imagine if butterflies
were yakking out there all over the place?

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.724
But I would like to ask butterflies
one question, which is,

00:00:30.748 --> 00:00:36.510
what is the meaning of some of the stories
that we humans tell about them?

00:00:36.534 --> 00:00:40.796
Because remarkably, all over the world,
cultures have really similar stories,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.860
similar mythologies about butterflies
having to do with the human soul.

00:00:44.884 --> 00:00:48.567
Some cultures tell us butterflies
are carrying the souls of children

00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:51.083
who have died wrongly or too soon,

00:00:51.107 --> 00:00:53.194
and other cultures
tell us that butterflies

00:00:53.218 --> 00:00:56.128
are carrying the souls
of our ancestors among us.

00:00:56.152 --> 00:01:00.326
This butterfly is called
a Kallima inachus.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.644
On one side, it looks
like a beautiful butterfly,

00:01:02.668 --> 00:01:04.762
and on the other side,
it looks like a leaf,

00:01:04.786 --> 00:01:07.007
and it folds up like a leaf
to elude predators.

00:01:07.031 --> 00:01:08.825
So now you see it, now you don't,

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:10.678
something hidden, something revealed.

00:01:10.702 --> 00:01:14.507
Maybe we got our ideas about
the human soul from this butterfly.

00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:19.159
So it's possible that butterflies
have some sort of outsized role

00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:20.928
in our afterlife.

00:01:20.952 --> 00:01:25.551
But in this life, in this world,
butterflies are in really serious trouble.

00:01:26.113 --> 00:01:27.637
This is a moth.

00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:30.796
Moths and butterflies are related.
Moths generally fly at night.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.152
This is called "praedicta," because
Darwin predicted that it must exist.

00:01:36.838 --> 00:01:41.043
So today, more than 60 species
of butterflies are endangered

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:42.235
around the world,

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:43.585
but even more than that,

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:46.950
insects are declining,
declining, declining.

00:01:46.974 --> 00:01:48.133
In the last 50 years,

00:01:48.157 --> 00:01:52.681
we've lost nearly 50 percent
of the total number of bodies of insects.

00:01:52.705 --> 00:01:55.323
Now this is a disaster.

00:01:55.347 --> 00:01:59.862
It could impact us in a more serious way
more quickly than climate change,

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:05.140
because butterflies don't do that much
in the ecosystem that we depend on,

00:02:05.164 --> 00:02:08.705
but they do things for other creatures
that we do depend on,

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.863
and that's the same story
with all insect life.

00:02:11.887 --> 00:02:15.966
Insect life is at the very foundation
of our life-support systems.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.785
We can't lose these insects.

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:22.563
Biodiversity all over the globe
is in a vast decline.

00:02:22.587 --> 00:02:28.301
Habitat loss, pesticides, herbicides
and impacts of climate change.

00:02:28.325 --> 00:02:30.318
Habitat loss is very serious,

00:02:30.342 --> 00:02:33.406
and that's where we really
have to get developing better,

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.580
more mindfully.

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:38.819
It's the worst of times,

00:02:38.843 --> 00:02:41.072
we are kind of overloaded
with our problems.

00:02:41.096 --> 00:02:44.389
It's also the best of times --
there's incredibly good news.

00:02:44.413 --> 00:02:46.350
We have exactly what we need.

00:02:46.374 --> 00:02:49.382
We have exactly the platform
to save nature.

00:02:49.406 --> 00:02:51.496
It's called citizen science.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.713
So citizen science is generally a term
used to mean people without a PhD

00:02:55.737 --> 00:02:57.833
contributing to scientific research.

00:02:57.857 --> 00:02:59.810
Sometimes, it's called community science,

00:02:59.834 --> 00:03:03.448
which gets at the communal purpose
of citizen science,

00:03:03.472 --> 00:03:05.887
which is to do something
for our commons together.

00:03:06.517 --> 00:03:08.096
It's amateur science.

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:11.923
It's being turbocharged today
by vast computing power,

00:03:11.947 --> 00:03:14.647
statistical analysis and the smartphone,

00:03:14.671 --> 00:03:17.798
but it's an ancient practice
that people have always practiced.

00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:19.558
It's amateur science.

00:03:19.582 --> 00:03:22.718
Professional science
has its roots in amateur science.

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:25.416
Charles Darwin was a citizen scientist.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.947
He had no advanced degree,
and he worked only for himself.

00:03:29.738 --> 00:03:33.665
So someone showed Darwin
this Madagascar star orchid,

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.238
which as a spur that's 12 inches long,

00:03:36.262 --> 00:03:40.129
and the spur is the part of a flower
that the nectar is in.

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:42.821
So this person showed this
to Darwin and said,

00:03:42.845 --> 00:03:47.971
"This proves that evolution
does not come about in a natural way.

00:03:47.995 --> 00:03:53.190
This flower proves that only God
can make these incredibly bizarre

00:03:53.214 --> 00:03:56.552
and tricky-looking creatures on the earth,

00:03:56.576 --> 00:03:59.354
because no insect
could possibly pollinate this.

00:03:59.378 --> 00:04:01.556
God must reproduce it."

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.071
And Darwin said, "No, I'm sure
that there is an insect somewhere

00:04:06.095 --> 00:04:10.766
with a proboscis long enough
to pollinate that star orchid."

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.857
And he was right.

00:04:13.526 --> 00:04:17.082
This is a map of the monarch butterfly.

00:04:17.573 --> 00:04:20.090
So, the monarch butterfly
has a different story

00:04:20.114 --> 00:04:21.590
than that particular moth,

00:04:21.614 --> 00:04:27.074
but reflects the same kind
of fundamental idea that Darwin had

00:04:27.098 --> 00:04:28.669
called coevolution,

00:04:28.693 --> 00:04:31.877
and coevolution is at the heart
of how nature works,

00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:35.067
and it's also at the heart
of what's going wrong with nature today.

00:04:35.091 --> 00:04:40.185
So over time, as the moth
developed a longer proboscis,

00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:43.034
so the plant developed a longer spur.

00:04:43.058 --> 00:04:44.265
Over millions of years,

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.424
the plant and the moth
developed a relationship

00:04:47.448 --> 00:04:51.550
whereby they both make each other's
chances of existence better.

00:04:53.248 --> 00:04:57.043
The monarch butterfly has a different kind
of coevolutionary relationship,

00:04:57.067 --> 00:04:59.528
and today, it is at the heart
of what's going wrong

00:04:59.552 --> 00:05:00.893
for the monarch butterfly.

00:05:00.917 --> 00:05:03.693
So this is a map of
the monarch butterfly migration.

00:05:03.717 --> 00:05:05.751
The monarch does this amazing thing,

00:05:05.775 --> 00:05:07.273
and over the course of a year,

00:05:07.297 --> 00:05:10.787
it goes over the entirety
of North America.

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:13.126
It does this in four or five generations.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.425
The first generations
only live a couple of weeks.

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.379
They mate, they lay eggs and they die.

00:05:19.403 --> 00:05:24.157
The next generation emerges as butterflies
and takes the next leg of the journey.

00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:25.785
Nobody knows how they do it.

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:29.857
By the time the fifth generation comes
back around -- and that one lives longer,

00:05:29.881 --> 00:05:32.749
they overwinter
in Mexico and California --

00:05:32.773 --> 00:05:34.323
by the time it gets there,

00:05:34.347 --> 00:05:37.803
those butterflies are going back
to where their ancestors came from,

00:05:37.827 --> 00:05:39.606
but they've never been there before,

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.932
and nobody that they're immediately
related to has been there before either.

00:05:43.956 --> 00:05:45.559
We don't know how they do it.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.316
The reason we know
they do this kind of migration --

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.579
and we still have a lot
of unanswered questions

00:05:51.603 --> 00:05:53.058
about the monarch migration --

00:05:53.082 --> 00:05:54.717
is because of citizen science.

00:05:54.741 --> 00:05:57.035
So for decades,
people have made observations

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:59.994
about monarch butterflies,
where and when they see them,

00:06:00.018 --> 00:06:06.522
and they've contributed these observations
to platforms like Journey North.

00:06:06.922 --> 00:06:13.032
This is a map of some observations
of butterflies given to Journey North.

00:06:13.056 --> 00:06:15.906
And if you can see the dots are coded

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.310
by what time of year
those observations were made.

00:06:19.334 --> 00:06:23.140
So these massive amounts of data
come into a place like Journey North,

00:06:23.164 --> 00:06:29.705
and they can create a map
of this time of over a course of a year

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:31.342
of where monarchs go.

00:06:31.366 --> 00:06:32.993
Also because of citizen science,

00:06:33.017 --> 00:06:36.759
we understand that monarch butterfly
numbers are going down, down, down.

00:06:36.783 --> 00:06:40.688
So in the 1980s, the overwintering
butterflies here in California,

00:06:40.712 --> 00:06:42.558
there were four million counted.

00:06:42.582 --> 00:06:44.121
Last year, 30,000.

00:06:44.145 --> 00:06:45.146
(Audience gasps)

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.438
Four million to 30,000 since the 1980s.

00:06:49.055 --> 00:06:51.832
The monarchs on the east coast
are doing a little better,

00:06:51.856 --> 00:06:53.235
but they're also going down.

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:55.275
OK, so what are we going to do about it?

00:06:55.299 --> 00:06:59.639
Well, very organically,
nobody really asking anybody to do it,

00:06:59.663 --> 00:07:04.371
people all over the continent
are supporting monarch butterflies.

00:07:04.395 --> 00:07:07.219
The heart of the problem
for monarchs is milkweed.

00:07:07.243 --> 00:07:10.610
It's another coevolutionary relationship,
and here's the story.

00:07:10.634 --> 00:07:13.015
Milkweed is toxic.

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:18.197
It has a poison in it that it evolved
to deter other insects from eating it,

00:07:18.221 --> 00:07:21.089
but the monarch developed
a different kind of relationship,

00:07:21.113 --> 00:07:23.333
a different strategy with the milkweed.

00:07:23.357 --> 00:07:25.592
Not only does it tolerate the toxin,

00:07:25.616 --> 00:07:29.318
the monarch actually sequesters
the toxin in its body,

00:07:29.342 --> 00:07:33.024
thus becoming poisonous to its predators.

00:07:33.746 --> 00:07:36.460
Monarch butterflies will only
lay their eggs on milkweed,

00:07:36.484 --> 00:07:39.429
and monarch caterpillars
will only eat milkweed,

00:07:39.453 --> 00:07:44.452
because they need that toxin to actually
create what they are as a species.

00:07:46.254 --> 00:07:49.849
So people are planting milkweed
all over the country

00:07:49.873 --> 00:07:52.826
where we have lost milkweed
due to habitat destruction,

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.047
pesticide use, herbicide use
and climate change impacts.

00:07:57.114 --> 00:08:02.119
You can create a lot of butterfly habitat
and pollinator habitat on a windowsill.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.186
You go to a native nursery in your area

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.307
and find out what's native
to where you live,

00:08:07.331 --> 00:08:09.957
and you will bring
beautiful things to yourself.

00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:14.927
Now, citizen science can do even more
than rescue monarch butterflies.

00:08:14.951 --> 00:08:17.801
It has the capacity to scale

00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:21.793
to the level necessary
that we need to mobilize to save nature.

00:08:21.817 --> 00:08:23.092
And this is an example.

00:08:23.116 --> 00:08:25.097
It's called City Nature Challenge,

00:08:25.121 --> 00:08:29.249
and City Nature Challenge is a project
of the California Academy of Sciences

00:08:29.273 --> 00:08:32.542
and the Los Angeles
Museum of Natural History.

00:08:32.977 --> 00:08:37.374
So for four years, City Nature Challenge
has enjoined cities all over the globe

00:08:37.398 --> 00:08:40.866
to participate in counting up
biodiversity in their cities.

00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:46.612
We're up to, like,
a million observations of biodiversity

00:08:46.636 --> 00:08:50.915
collected by people
around the globe this past April.

00:08:50.939 --> 00:08:55.614
The winner this year was South Africa,
much to the chagrin of San Francisco.

00:08:55.638 --> 00:08:56.800
(Laughter)

00:08:56.824 --> 00:08:59.323
Look at them, they have
more biodiversity than we do.

00:08:59.347 --> 00:09:02.831
It's kind of an interesting thing,
what is revealed when you start seeing

00:09:02.855 --> 00:09:05.061
what are the natural resources
where you live,

00:09:05.085 --> 00:09:08.699
because as we go forward, you want to live
where there's more biodiversity.

00:09:08.723 --> 00:09:12.131
And by the way, citizen science
is a very good tool for social justice

00:09:12.155 --> 00:09:14.921
and environmental justice goals,
for helping reach them.

00:09:14.945 --> 00:09:17.501
You need to have data
and you need to show a picture,

00:09:17.525 --> 00:09:18.931
you need to point to a cause

00:09:18.955 --> 00:09:21.391
and then you need to have
the surgical strike

00:09:21.415 --> 00:09:23.514
to help support whatever that problem is.

00:09:25.052 --> 00:09:29.036
So City Nature Challenge, I think,
should get a commendation from the UN.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:35.418
Has there ever been a global effort
on behalf of nature

00:09:35.442 --> 00:09:38.402
undertaken in this coordinated manner?

00:09:38.426 --> 00:09:40.945
It's amazing, it's fantastic

00:09:40.969 --> 00:09:43.314
and it's really a pretty grassroots thing,

00:09:43.338 --> 00:09:47.791
and we get very interesting information
about butterflies and other creatures

00:09:47.815 --> 00:09:49.976
when we do these bioblitzes.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.816
City Nature Challenge basically works
with a tool called iNaturalist,

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.430
and iNaturalist is your entry drug
to citizen science. (Laughs)

00:09:57.454 --> 00:10:01.794
I suggest signing up for it
on a laptop or on a desktop,

00:10:01.818 --> 00:10:03.785
and then you put the app on your phone.

00:10:04.241 --> 00:10:09.503
With iNaturalist, you take a picture
of a bird, a bug, a snake, anything,

00:10:09.527 --> 00:10:15.182
and an artificial intelligence function
and an expert vetting system

00:10:15.206 --> 00:10:17.873
works to verify that observation.

00:10:17.897 --> 00:10:22.016
The app gives the observation the date,
the time, the latitude and the longitude,

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.056
geolocates that observation.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.440
That's the data, that's the science
of citizen science.

00:10:27.464 --> 00:10:29.856
And then that data is shared,

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.572
and that sharing,
that is the soul of citizen science.

00:10:33.968 --> 00:10:35.437
When we share data,

00:10:35.461 --> 00:10:38.961
we can see much bigger pictures
of what's going on.

00:10:38.985 --> 00:10:41.934
There's no way to see
that whole monarch migration

00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:46.405
without sharing data
that's been collected over decades,

00:10:46.429 --> 00:10:49.041
seeing the heart and soul
of how nature works

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:50.859
through citizen science.

00:10:51.281 --> 00:10:52.988
This is a Xerces blue butterfly,

00:10:53.012 --> 00:10:57.035
which went extinct when it lost
its habitat in Golden Gate Park.

00:10:57.059 --> 00:11:00.646
It had a coevolutionary relationship
with an ant, and that's another story.

00:11:01.003 --> 00:11:02.594
(Laughter)

00:11:02.618 --> 00:11:05.578
I'll end by asking you,

00:11:05.602 --> 00:11:10.147
please participate in citizen science
in some way, shape or form.

00:11:10.783 --> 00:11:13.482
It is an amazingly positive thing.

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:16.204
It takes an army of people
to make it really work.

00:11:17.474 --> 00:11:20.189
And I'll just add that I think butterflies

00:11:20.213 --> 00:11:22.522
probably really do have
enough on their plate

00:11:22.546 --> 00:11:24.650
without carrying around human souls.

00:11:24.978 --> 00:11:26.928
(Laughter)

00:11:26.952 --> 00:11:28.832
But there's a lot we don't know, right?

00:11:28.856 --> 00:11:32.048
And what about all those stories?
What are those stories telling us?

00:11:32.072 --> 00:11:35.925
Maybe we coevolved our souls
with butterflies?

00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:40.626
Certainly, we are connected to butterflies
in deeper ways than we currently know,

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.223
and the mystery of the butterfly
will never be revealed

00:11:43.247 --> 00:11:44.547
if we don't save them.

00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:50.436
So, please join me
in helping to save nature now.

00:11:51.206 --> 00:11:52.357
Thank you.

00:11:52.381 --> 00:11:55.380
(Applause)
