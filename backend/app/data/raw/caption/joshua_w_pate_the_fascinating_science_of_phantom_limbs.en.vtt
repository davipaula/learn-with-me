00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.269
The vast majority of people 
who’ve lost a limb can still feel it—

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.976
not as a memory or vague shape,
but in complete lifelike detail.

00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:19.438
They can flex their phantom fingers

00:00:19.438 --> 00:00:22.722
and sometimes even feel 
the chafe of a watchband

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:25.948
or the throb of an ingrown toenail.

00:00:25.948 --> 00:00:27.917
And astonishingly enough,

00:00:27.917 --> 00:00:33.464
occasionally even people born 
without a limb can feel a phantom.

00:00:33.464 --> 00:00:36.650
So what causes phantom limb sensations?

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.692
The accuracy of these apparitions

00:00:38.692 --> 00:00:42.364
suggests that we have a map 
of the body in our brains.

00:00:42.364 --> 00:00:43.747
And the fact that it’s possible

00:00:43.747 --> 00:00:46.944
for someone who’s never had a limb 
to feel one

00:00:46.944 --> 00:00:51.607
implies we are born with at least 
the beginnings of this map.

00:00:51.607 --> 00:00:55.172
But one thing sets the phantoms
that appear after amputation

00:00:55.172 --> 00:00:58.459
apart from their flesh 
and blood predecessors:

00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:01.593
the vast majority of them are painful.

00:01:01.593 --> 00:01:05.447
To fully understand phantom limbs 
and phantom pain,

00:01:05.447 --> 00:01:09.802
we have to consider the entire pathway 
from limb to brain.

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:13.624
Our limbs are full of sensory neurons
responsible for everything

00:01:13.624 --> 00:01:16.082
from the textures we feel 
with our fingertips

00:01:16.082 --> 00:01:20.048
to our understanding 
of where our bodies are in space.

00:01:20.048 --> 00:01:24.342
Neural pathways carry this sensory input
through the spinal cord

00:01:24.342 --> 00:01:26.009
and up to the brain.

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.042
Since so much of this path 
lies outside the limb itself,

00:01:30.042 --> 00:01:34.184
most of it remains 
behind after an amputation.

00:01:34.184 --> 00:01:35.623
But the loss of a limb

00:01:35.623 --> 00:01:40.260
alters the way signals travel 
at every step of the pathway.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.031
At the site of an amputation,

00:01:42.031 --> 00:01:46.264
severed nerve endings can thicken 
and become more sensitive,

00:01:46.264 --> 00:01:50.697
transmitting distress signals 
even in response to mild pressure.

00:01:50.697 --> 00:01:52.386
Under normal circumstances,

00:01:52.386 --> 00:01:56.988
these signals would be curtailed 
in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.

00:01:56.988 --> 00:02:00.957
For reasons we don’t fully understand,
after an amputation,

00:02:00.957 --> 00:02:05.623
there is a loss of this inhibitory
control in the dorsal horn,

00:02:05.623 --> 00:02:08.776
and signals can intensify.

00:02:08.776 --> 00:02:13.214
Once they pass through the spinal cord,
sensory signals reach the brain.

00:02:13.214 --> 00:02:17.194
There, the somatosensory cortex 
processes them.

00:02:17.194 --> 00:02:20.611
The entire body is mapped in this cortex.

00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:23.375
Sensitive body parts 
with many nerve endings,

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:25.136
like the lips and hands,

00:02:25.136 --> 00:02:27.710
are represented by the largest areas.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.994
The cortical homunculus is a model 
of the human body

00:02:30.994 --> 00:02:36.481
with proportions based on the size of each
body part’s representation in the cortex,

00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:41.406
The amount of cortex devoted 
to a specific body part can grow or shrink

00:02:41.406 --> 00:02:46.124
based on how much sensory input 
the brain receives from that body part.

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:51.213
For example, representation of the left
hand is larger in violinists

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:53.693
than in non-violinists.

00:02:53.693 --> 00:02:56.377
The brain also increases 
cortical representation

00:02:56.377 --> 00:02:58.489
when a body part is injured

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.259
in order to heighten sensations 
that alert us to danger.

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:06.700
This increased representation 
can lead to phantom pain.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.617
The cortical map is also 
most likely responsible

00:03:09.617 --> 00:03:13.223
for the feeling of body parts 
that are no longer there,

00:03:13.223 --> 00:03:16.505
because they still 
have representation in the brain.

00:03:16.505 --> 00:03:22.172
Over time, this representation may shrink
and the phantom limb may shrink with it.

00:03:22.172 --> 00:03:26.757
But phantom limb sensations 
don’t necessarily disappear on their own.

00:03:26.757 --> 00:03:29.632
Treatment for phantom pain 
usually requires

00:03:29.632 --> 00:03:31.495
a combination of physical therapy,

00:03:31.495 --> 00:03:33.302
medications for pain management,

00:03:33.302 --> 00:03:34.377
prosthetics,

00:03:34.377 --> 00:03:36.052
and time.

00:03:36.052 --> 00:03:38.301
A technique called mirror box therapy

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:41.368
can be very helpful in developing 
the range of motion

00:03:41.368 --> 00:03:43.967
and reducing pain in the phantom limb.

00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:48.076
The patient places the phantom limb 
into a box behind a mirror

00:03:48.076 --> 00:03:50.699
and the intact limb 
in front of the mirror.

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:53.866
This tricks the brain 
into seeing the phantom

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:55.913
rather than just feeling it.

00:03:55.913 --> 00:03:59.045
Scientists are developing 
virtual reality treatments

00:03:59.045 --> 00:04:03.726
that make the experience 
of mirror box therapy even more lifelike.

00:04:03.726 --> 00:04:06.700
Prosthetics can also 
create a similar effect—

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.318
many patients report pain

00:04:08.318 --> 00:04:11.593
primarily when they remove 
their prosthetics at night.

00:04:11.593 --> 00:04:13.801
And phantom limbs may in turn

00:04:13.801 --> 00:04:18.733
help patients conceptualize
prosthetics as extensions of their bodies

00:04:18.733 --> 00:04:21.142
and manipulate them intuitively.

00:04:21.142 --> 00:04:24.530
There are still many questions 
about phantom limbs.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.688
We don’t know why some amputees
escape the pain

00:04:27.688 --> 00:04:30.008
typically associated 
with these apparitions,

00:04:30.008 --> 00:04:32.490
or why some don’t have phantoms at all.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.149
And further research into phantom limbs

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:38.527
isn’t just applicable to the people 
who experience them.

00:04:38.527 --> 00:04:40.797
A deeper understanding 
of these apparitions

00:04:40.797 --> 00:04:45.027
will give us insight into the work
our brains do every day

00:04:45.027 --> 00:04:47.625
to build the world as we perceive it.

00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:49.272
They’re an important reminder

00:04:49.272 --> 00:04:53.408
that the realities we experience are,
in fact, subjective.
