00:00:07.828 --> 00:00:12.526
For almost a decade, scientists chased 
the source of a deadly new virus

00:00:12.526 --> 00:00:16.526
through China’s tallest mountains 
and most isolated caverns.

00:00:16.526 --> 00:00:21.256
They finally found it here: 
in the bats of Shitou Cave.

00:00:21.256 --> 00:00:23.486
The virus in question was a coronavirus

00:00:23.486 --> 00:00:27.489
that caused an epidemic 
of severe acute respiratory syndrome,

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.739
or SARS, in 2003.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.889
Coronaviruses are a group of viruses

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:36.433
covered in little protein spikes 
that look like a crown—

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:38.233
or "corona" in Latin.

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:41.213
There are hundreds 
of known coronaviruses.

00:00:41.213 --> 00:00:45.320
Seven of them infect humans, 
and can cause disease.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.866
The coronavirus SARS-CoV causes SARS, 
MERS-CoV causes MERS,

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:56.859
and SARS-CoV-2 causes 
the disease COVID-19.

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.229
Of the seven human coronaviruses, 
four cause colds,

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.323
mild, highly contagious infections 
of the nose and throat.

00:01:05.323 --> 00:01:10.081
Two infect the lungs, 
and cause much more severe illnesses.

00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:14.571
The seventh, which causes COVID-19, 
has features of each:

00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:18.929
it spreads easily, 
but can severely impact the lungs.

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:23.661
When an infected person coughs, 
droplets containing the virus spray out.

00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:28.496
The virus can infect a new person when
the droplets enter their nose or mouth.

00:01:28.496 --> 00:01:31.786
Coronaviruses transmit best 
in enclosed spaces,

00:01:31.786 --> 00:01:33.456
where people are close together.

00:01:33.456 --> 00:01:36.866
Cold weather keeps their delicate casing
from drying out,

00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:40.156
enabling the virus to survive 
for longer between hosts,

00:01:40.156 --> 00:01:43.744
while UV exposure from sunlight 
may damage it.

00:01:43.744 --> 00:01:47.484
These seasonal variations matter more 
for established viruses.

00:01:47.484 --> 00:01:50.394
But because no one is yet immune 
to a new virus,

00:01:50.394 --> 00:01:55.393
it has so many potential hosts that it
doesn’t need ideal conditions to spread.

00:01:55.393 --> 00:02:00.026
In the body, the protein spikes embed
in the host’s cells and fuse with them—

00:02:00.026 --> 00:02:02.896
enabling the virus to hijack 
the host cell’s machinery

00:02:02.896 --> 00:02:05.536
to replicate its own genes.

00:02:05.536 --> 00:02:08.616
Coronaviruses store their genes on RNA.

00:02:08.616 --> 00:02:12.683
All viruses are either RNA viruses 
or DNA viruses.

00:02:12.683 --> 00:02:15.704
RNA viruses tend to be smaller, 
with fewer genes,

00:02:15.704 --> 00:02:20.259
meaning they infect many hosts 
and replicate quickly in those hosts.

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:24.460
In general, RNA viruses don’t have 
a proofreading mechanism,

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.060
whereas DNA viruses do.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.360
So when an RNA virus replicates,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.405
it’s much more likely to have 
mistakes called mutations.

00:02:33.405 --> 00:02:37.337
Many of these mutations are useless 
or even harmful.

00:02:37.337 --> 00:02:40.467
But some make the virus better suited
for certain environments—

00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:42.957
like a new host species.

00:02:42.957 --> 00:02:47.429
Epidemics often occur when a virus 
jumps from animals to humans.

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:49.973
This is true of the RNA viruses 
that caused

00:02:49.973 --> 00:02:55.876
the Ebola, Zika, and SARS epidemics, 
and the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:58.736
Once in humans, the virus still mutates—

00:02:58.736 --> 00:03:00.996
usually not enough to create a new virus,

00:03:00.996 --> 00:03:05.321
but enough to create variations, 
or strains, of the original one.

00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:09.975
Coronaviruses have a few key differences 
from most RNA viruses.

00:03:09.975 --> 00:03:13.333
They’re some of the largest, 
meaning they have the most genes.

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:16.931
That creates more opportunity 
for harmful mutations.

00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:21.067
To counteract this risk, 
coronaviruses have a unique feature:

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:25.067
an enzyme that checks for replication 
errors and corrects mistakes.

00:03:25.067 --> 00:03:27.757
This makes coronaviruses 
much more stable,

00:03:27.757 --> 00:03:31.367
with a slower mutation rate, 
than other RNA viruses.

00:03:31.367 --> 00:03:33.637
While this may sound formidable,

00:03:33.637 --> 00:03:36.617
the slow mutation rate 
is actually a promising sign

00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:38.857
when it comes to disarming them.

00:03:38.857 --> 00:03:42.217
After an infection, our immune systems 
can recognize germs

00:03:42.217 --> 00:03:45.307
and destroy them more quickly 
if they infect us again

00:03:45.307 --> 00:03:47.397
so they don’t make us sick.

00:03:47.397 --> 00:03:51.137
But mutations can make a virus 
less recognizable to our immune systems—

00:03:51.137 --> 00:03:53.717
and therefore more difficult to fight off.

00:03:53.717 --> 00:03:57.617
They can also make antiviral drugs 
and vaccines less effective,

00:03:57.617 --> 00:04:01.477
because they’re tailored 
very specifically to a virus.

00:04:01.477 --> 00:04:04.417
That’s why we need a new flu vaccine
every year—

00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:09.248
the influenza virus mutates so quickly 
that new strains pop up constantly.

00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:11.938
The slower mutation rate 
of coronaviruses means

00:04:11.938 --> 00:04:14.678
our immune systems, drugs, 
and vaccines

00:04:14.678 --> 00:04:18.166
might be able to recognize them 
for longer after infection,

00:04:18.166 --> 00:04:21.026
and therefore protect us better.

00:04:21.026 --> 00:04:25.710
Still, we don’t know how long our bodies
remain immune to different coronaviruses.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.611
There’s never been an approved treatment
or vaccine for a coronavirus.

00:04:29.611 --> 00:04:32.331
We haven’t focused on treating 
the ones that cause colds,

00:04:32.331 --> 00:04:36.091
and though scientists began developing
treatments for SARS and MERS,

00:04:36.091 --> 00:04:40.367
the epidemics ended before those 
treatments completed clinical trials.

00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:43.487
As we continue to encroach 
on other animals’ habitats,

00:04:43.487 --> 00:04:48.620
some scientists say a new coronavirus 
jumping to humans is inevitable—

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.548
but if we investigate these unknowns, 
it doesn’t have to be devastating.
