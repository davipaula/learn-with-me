00:00:06.627 --> 00:00:10.557
As the April sun rises 
on a pile of firewood,

00:00:10.557 --> 00:00:13.425
something royal stirs inside.

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:17.745
This wasp queen is one of thousands 
who mated in late autumn

00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:19.975
and hibernated through the winter.

00:00:19.975 --> 00:00:24.525
Now she emerges into the spring air 
to begin her reign.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:26.835
Most of her sisters weren’t so lucky.

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:30.925
While hibernating in compost piles 
and underground burrows,

00:00:30.925 --> 00:00:34.958
many sleeping queens 
were eaten by spiders.

00:00:34.958 --> 00:00:39.604
Warm winters caused by climate change 
led other queens to emerge early,

00:00:39.604 --> 00:00:42.864
only to find there was no available food.

00:00:42.864 --> 00:00:47.429
And some queens that survived the winter 
fell victim to the threats of spring,

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:52.382
such as carnivorous plants, birds, 
and manmade pesticides.

00:00:52.382 --> 00:00:56.092
Our queen is the lone survivor 
of her old hive, and now,

00:00:56.092 --> 00:00:59.325
she must become 
the foundress of a new one.

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.243
But first, breakfast.

00:01:01.243 --> 00:01:05.273
The queen heads for a citrus grove 
full of honeybee hives.

00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:07.560
The bees can be dangerous if provoked,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.703
but right now they’re paralyzed 
by the morning cold.

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:15.023
Their hairy bodies are dripping 
with sugar water from an earlier feeding,

00:01:15.023 --> 00:01:19.295
and the resourceful queen 
licks them for a morning snack.

00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:23.308
Newly energized, our queen searches 
for a safe nesting area.

00:01:23.308 --> 00:01:28.728
This tree hollow, safe from rain, wind, 
and predators, is ideal.

00:01:28.728 --> 00:01:31.788
She chews the surrounding wood 
and plant fibers

00:01:31.788 --> 00:01:33.828
to make a paper-like pulp.

00:01:33.828 --> 00:01:39.795
Then she builds around 50 brood cells 
that comprise the beginning of her nest.

00:01:39.795 --> 00:01:42.445
Using sperm stored from last fall,

00:01:42.445 --> 00:01:45.978
the queen lays a fertilized egg 
into each cell,

00:01:45.978 --> 00:01:49.128
producing as many as 12 in 20 minutes.

00:01:49.128 --> 00:01:52.508
Within a week, 
these will hatch into female larva.

00:01:52.508 --> 00:01:57.899
But until then, the queen must hunt down 
smaller insects to feed her brood,

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.599
all while expanding the hive, laying eggs,
and defending against intruders.

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:06.519
Fortunately, our queen is well prepared.

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:11.687
Unlike bees, wasps can sting as many times
as they need to.

00:02:11.687 --> 00:02:16.027
With such a busy schedule, 
the queen barely has time to feed herself.

00:02:16.027 --> 00:02:18.060
Luckily, she doesn’t have to.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.480
When she feeds an insect to her grubs,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.182
they digest the bug into a sugary 
substance that sustains their mother.

00:02:26.182 --> 00:02:31.619
By the end of July, these first larva 
have matured into adult workers,

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:35.499
ready to take on foraging, 
building, and defense.

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:38.396
The queen can now lay eggs full-time,

00:02:38.396 --> 00:02:43.514
sustaining herself on her worker’s spoils 
and their unfertilized eggs.

00:02:43.514 --> 00:02:46.874
Although each worker only lives 
for roughly 3 weeks,

00:02:46.874 --> 00:02:50.700
the queen’s continuous egg-laying 
swells their ranks.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.931
In just one summer, 
the nest reaches the size of a basketball,

00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:57.268
supporting thousands of workers.

00:02:57.268 --> 00:02:59.893
Such a large population needs to eat,

00:02:59.893 --> 00:03:03.251
and the nearby garden 
provides a veritable buffet.

00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:07.251
As the swarm descends, 
alarmed humans try to swat them.

00:03:07.251 --> 00:03:11.783
They even fight back with pesticides 
that purposefully poison wasps,

00:03:11.783 --> 00:03:16.604
and inadvertently impact 
a wide-range of local wildlife.

00:03:16.604 --> 00:03:20.054
But the wasps are actually vital 
to this ecosystem.

00:03:20.054 --> 00:03:23.651
Sitting at the top 
of the local invertebrate food chain,

00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:28.412
these insects keep spiders, mites, 
and centipedes, in check.

00:03:28.412 --> 00:03:31.022
Wasps consume crop-eating insects,

00:03:31.022 --> 00:03:34.705
making them particularly helpful 
for farms and gardens.

00:03:34.705 --> 00:03:37.065
They even pollinate fruits and vegetables,

00:03:37.065 --> 00:03:40.245
and help winemakers 
by biting into their grapes

00:03:40.245 --> 00:03:42.885
and jump-starting fermentation.

00:03:42.885 --> 00:03:47.566
This feast continues until autumn, 
when the foundress changes course.

00:03:47.566 --> 00:03:51.926
She begins grooming some eggs 
into a new generation of queens,

00:03:51.926 --> 00:03:54.227
while also laying unfertilized eggs

00:03:54.227 --> 00:03:58.785
that will mature into reproductive males 
called drones.

00:03:58.785 --> 00:04:02.642
This new crop of queens and males 
requires more food.

00:04:02.642 --> 00:04:06.045
But with summer over, 
the usual sources run dry,

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:10.860
and the foraging wasps 
start taking more aggressive risks.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.630
By September, 
the hive’s organization deteriorates.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.024
Hungry workers no longer clean the nest 
and various scavengers move in.

00:04:20.024 --> 00:04:23.484
Just when it seems 
the hive can no longer sustain itself,

00:04:23.484 --> 00:04:28.661
the fertile queens and their drones 
depart in a massive swarm.

00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:31.611
As the days grow colder, 
the workers starve,

00:04:31.611 --> 00:04:34.500
and our queen 
reaches the end of her lifespan.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.721
But above, a swarm of reproductive wasps 
has successfully mated.

00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:42.111
The males die off shortly after,

00:04:42.111 --> 00:04:46.803
but the newly fertilized queens are ready 
to find shelter for their long sleep.

00:04:46.803 --> 00:04:51.263
And this woodpile looks like 
the perfect place to spend the winter.
