00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.576
"Listen.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.800
Do you hear that?"

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.040
my grandmother asked me.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.536
"Listen.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.600
Listen to what the beetle is saying."

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.296
I would spend hours and hours
listening to the little beetle

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.816
rolling a huge ball of dung,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.376
and while at it,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.960
I heard a variety of environmental sounds.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.936
With the keenest of ears,
I would hear family chatter,

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.376
laughter,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.936
the wind howling

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.720
and even crickets chirping.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.816
All these sounds crisscrossed
into each other,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.680
and I would hear rhythm in between.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:59.016
Then I would beat my plate with a spoon
and my chest with my tiny hands

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.080
trying to recreate what I was hearing.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.496
I have been beating the same plates,

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.456
shakers, drums, pans
and so much more ever since

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.816
to become a professional drummer

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.040
and percussionist.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.240
(Applause)

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.896
As I grew up, subconsciously,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.216
I felt a strong urge
to hide my newfound hobby.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.536
Even without it being said out loud,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.880
I knew that somehow
it was wrong to do what I was doing.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.536
In most of the ceremonies,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.656
I noticed that most of the women
and girls were not in sight,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.216
but when they were,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.776
I noticed that they would wear
their dancing skirts

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.216
and shake their waists off,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.016
singing, clapping, ululating,

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.320
while the men filled up
the rhythm section.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.136
A few years later, I came to understand

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.056
what tradition and culture meant,

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.256
and what was considered taboo

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.480
or otherwise.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.240
In the majority of African cultures,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.776
women have been forbidden
to play drums and percussion

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.280
for a very long time.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.256
I believe this taboo stems from
the psychological and traditional belief

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.760
that the woman is an inferior being.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:24.736
I grew up hearing that the place
of the woman is in the kitchen

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.040
or in the other room.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.280
Mhm?

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.400
(Laughter)

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.776
Women had been brainwashed
and led on for so long

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.640
until we had fallen victim and actually
started believing in this ourselves.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.176
This, coupled with the lack
of interest to educate women,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.096
played a major, major role

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.720
in etching this into our minds.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.176
The sounds of the drum
provoke emotion and movement.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.600
Essentially, the drum
is a very sensual instrument.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.616
Once at a festival, a man asked me

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.720
how I dared put a drum in between my legs.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.280
I have been considered loose and dirty
for playing an instrument.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.016
I have repeatedly been questioned

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.376
why I would choose to play drums

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.496
instead of practicing journalism,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.416
which I studied for my undergraduate,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.840
which has been termed "more decent."

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.616
The sight of a woman
playing drums enfeebles her,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.920
makes her less feminine,

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.136
less desirable,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.480
but all this optimally
puts her on a lower social stand.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.416
Drumming has essentially represented
the strong African heritage,

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.896
and its importance can be seen

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.040
in the many aspects
of the African tradition.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.216
Many communities encompass drumming
in their day-to-day activities,

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.176
and still do up to date,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.296
from childbirths to initiation ceremonies,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.296
welcoming ceremonies,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.240
marriages and even burials.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.016
However, this same drum

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.536
is disappearing very fast
from the music scene,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.536
and the traditional genre
is losing its popularity

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.520
very quickly amongst the people.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.336
Inspired by the need
to preserve this culture,

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.856
I am teaching the significance
and the importance of the drum

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.400
to young boys, women and girls.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.456
In my journey as a percussion teacher,

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.536
I have realized that very many women

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.815
actually want to play the drum,

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:34.736
but at the same time,

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.336
they fear it.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.736
Some fear how society will perceive them.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.936
Others fear the physical pain
that comes with playing.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.520
Oh yes, it's not that easy.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.496
Some, because their spouses
don't approve of them,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.056
and others generally
fear the responsibility

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.080
of being a bearer of culture.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.456
I believe, or I think that all these fears

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.296
are etched in the collective
feminine cautiousness

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.136
because when we learn of the atrocities
that have happened to women,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.496
continentally especially,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.256
it serves as a constant reminder

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.496
that one step out of our designated place

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.480
may end up in very serious consequences.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.456
Well, I use my drum to tell my story
and my people's stories.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.720
My roots shaped me
and my culture is here to stay with me.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.096
Women can be custodians of culture, too.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.456
We are born to bring forth life,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.056
to nurture it.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.080
We can definitely preserve our traditions
very, very excellently.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.480
My drum and I,

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.920
we are here to stay.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.336
(Applause)

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.600
We are definitely here to stay.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.296
If women have led countries,

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.656
women have gone to space,

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.896
women have won Grammys,

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.136
then the same, same women
can play the drum

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.176
and play it -- to a five-star rating?

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.456
No, to a million-star rating.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.696
Thank you.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.000
(Applause)

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.920
(Chiming)

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.440
(Metallic drumming)

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.360
(Chiming)

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.800
(Rattling)

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.760
(Drumming)

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.840
(Applause)
