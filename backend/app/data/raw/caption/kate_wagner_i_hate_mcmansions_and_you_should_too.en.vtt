00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:29.357
First of all, I'd like to apologize 
to anyone in the room

00:00:29.357 --> 00:00:32.489
who considers themselves 
to be architecturally sensitive.

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.130
What you're about to see may upset you.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.852
So, the number one question 
I get in my inbox all the time is,

00:00:39.852 --> 00:00:43.822
so McMansion hell,
what the hell is McMansion?

00:00:44.602 --> 00:00:46.576
So, it's pretty easy.

00:00:46.576 --> 00:00:48.732
I've narrowed it down
to a couple of factors.

00:00:48.732 --> 00:00:51.462
First of all, they are oversized.

00:00:51.462 --> 00:00:53.538
That means there's over 3,000 square feet

00:00:53.538 --> 00:00:59.178
which is 500 feet more than the highest
national housing average.

00:00:59.178 --> 00:01:05.022
So, AKA that space, as you can
see here probably 26 children.

00:01:05.022 --> 00:01:05.782
(Laughter)

00:01:05.782 --> 00:01:08.521
And the other thing is,
if you look at this house,

00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:11.225
which is quite lovely,

00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:13.635
(Laughter)

00:01:13.635 --> 00:01:14.904
I'm sorry.

00:01:14.904 --> 00:01:18.878
This house probably has
three media rooms,

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:24.021
seven bathrooms with a garden tub,
and a chandelier and whatever,

00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:27.894
but it doesn't have a front porch 
and I cannot find the front door.

00:01:27.894 --> 00:01:29.804
(Laughter)

00:01:29.804 --> 00:01:31.443
Also there's no lawn

00:01:31.443 --> 00:01:36.012
So, that leads to my second point,
they are poorly designed.

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:40.124
So, that means there's no respect 
for form or scale or other things

00:01:40.124 --> 00:01:44.681
that people in the architecture would call
'the basic rules of architecture.'

00:01:44.681 --> 00:01:46.363
So, as you can see here,

00:01:46.363 --> 00:01:48.774
this house looks like 
it was designed by someone

00:01:48.774 --> 00:01:51.076
who maybe saw a house 
once in their life,

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:53.455
but either had some sort of visual issues

00:01:53.455 --> 00:01:58.089
or was wearing kaleidoscope glasses 
that you get during Halloween.

00:01:58.089 --> 00:02:03.192
Even worse these poorly designed houses 
are cheaply constructed.

00:02:03.196 --> 00:02:04.868
So, I will get to that in a second.

00:02:04.888 --> 00:02:07.838
But, I'd like to point out that 
this is an engineering marvel.

00:02:07.838 --> 00:02:12.623
This is a house that is a wood frame 
covered in different types of foam.

00:02:12.623 --> 00:02:13.613
(Laughter)

00:02:13.613 --> 00:02:18.336
So, and finally, they are disrespectful.

00:02:18.336 --> 00:02:20.776
(Laughter)

00:02:20.776 --> 00:02:24.968
So, you have to feel really bad 
for the poor folks in these little houses

00:02:24.968 --> 00:02:28.759
who on longer have 
any natural light in their homes.

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:32.809
It is a dark time for them
as it is for all of us.

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:36.794
So, basically they are 
fundamentally bad architecture.

00:02:36.821 --> 00:02:39.531
Now, even though
I'm dressed impeccably well,

00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:44.941
I'm not the gatekeeper of what is 
and is not good aesthetic architecture.

00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:48.213
But, we've been talking about these 
things in architectural history

00:02:48.213 --> 00:02:50.567
for thousands of years 
starting with Vitruvius,

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:52.924
the great-great-great
-granddaddy of architecture.

00:02:52.924 --> 00:02:56.110
Sorry art history majors,
this is going to be boring.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.265
So, Vitruvius said that architecture
should be three things, right?

00:02:59.265 --> 00:03:03.265
It should be durable, it should be useful 
or functional, and it should be beautiful.

00:03:03.265 --> 00:03:07.117
And McMansions are well,
you know, none of these things.

00:03:07.117 --> 00:03:09.472
So, let's start with durable.

00:03:09.472 --> 00:03:14.254
So, through most of human history
houses were built to last generations,

00:03:14.254 --> 00:03:17.157
that means that you 
were born in the house,

00:03:17.157 --> 00:03:19.215
had kids in your house,
died in your house,

00:03:19.215 --> 00:03:22.424
and then your kids had kids 
in your house and died in your house.

00:03:22.424 --> 00:03:24.628
AKA, they were permanent.

00:03:24.628 --> 00:03:29.628
That changed in the 1980s with access to
cheaper construction methods and materials

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.749
and also in deregulation economies, etc,

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:36.773
causing a huge housing bubble,
right? That we all know of.

00:03:36.773 --> 00:03:40.413
And basically these houses 
weren't built to last 15 years,

00:03:40.422 --> 00:03:44.840
because they were built to have the most 
amount of space for the lowest price,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.280
and people didn't really care about 
how long they'd last anyway

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.053
because they were going to live there
for maybe six years, maybe less

00:03:54.053 --> 00:03:57.811
because they were going to flip that house
and make, like, a million dollars.

00:03:57.811 --> 00:03:59.528
A million dollars.

00:03:59.528 --> 00:04:01.998
(Laughter)

00:04:01.998 --> 00:04:05.698
And they would be on the next house
before you ever knew it,

00:04:05.708 --> 00:04:07.424
so it was not their problem anymore,

00:04:07.424 --> 00:04:09.023
but we all know how that ended.

00:04:09.023 --> 00:04:11.860
So that brings me 
to another part of durability-

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.270
they are not aesthetically durable.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.808
That means that certain 
house designs like you know,

00:04:16.808 --> 00:04:20.100
you have the box, and the box
has a roof and the roof looks like this,

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.789
and this is the house that every child 
draws, this is your idea of the house.

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.337
These houses, of course,
as you can see in this case,

00:04:26.337 --> 00:04:31.882
this is a house that is got water damage,
and the balconies don't lay anywhere,

00:04:31.882 --> 00:04:36.521
you can actually go out open those doors,
you will fall into your yard.

00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:37.741
(Laughter)

00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:39.251
These were just trends.

00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:42.611
People saw stuff like this on TV
and said, "I want that on my house."

00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:44.948
And so they're not really 
aesthetically durable

00:04:44.948 --> 00:04:47.370
because they were built on these trends,

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.840
and when the trends ran out,

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.621
they would be onto
the third house or the fourth house

00:04:51.621 --> 00:04:54.509
because they were flipping
and making millions of dollars.

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:59.499
So, according to Bloomberg now,
these houses aren't selling well.

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:03.484
And houses that are smaller,
you know, like normal people houses,

00:05:03.484 --> 00:05:07.314
built for normal people
not giant cars to live in,

00:05:07.314 --> 00:05:11.534
are appreciating
at a much higher and faster rate.

00:05:11.534 --> 00:05:15.567
And so we are gonna move on to useful.
What does it mean for house to be useful?

00:05:15.567 --> 00:05:18.302
So there are primary uses for a house.

00:05:18.302 --> 00:05:22.352
One is to keep us,
you know, out of the elements.

00:05:22.352 --> 00:05:23.932
Like you saw in the last example,

00:05:23.932 --> 00:05:27.524
it's not doing a good job of that
with the water damage in the missing deck.

00:05:28.964 --> 00:05:32.184
Oh, speaking of the elements,

00:05:32.184 --> 00:05:34.718
imaging trying to heat 
and cool that house.

00:05:34.718 --> 00:05:40.008
So you can't even stay warm or cool
without spending millions of dollars.

00:05:40.008 --> 00:05:41.598
(Laughter)

00:05:42.888 --> 00:05:45.380
But most of all, a house is
suppose to be our home.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.300
It's a place for our sanctuary, community,
and being one with our families.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.540
And in a space that is designed 
where everyone has their own room,

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.079
and their own living room,
and their own dining room,

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:59.068
and their own pool table?

00:05:59.068 --> 00:06:02.004
You don't have to interact 
with any members of your family.

00:06:02.004 --> 00:06:06.688
So trust me I would have
loved that in the seventh grade.

00:06:06.688 --> 00:06:09.868
But I think most of us
are the well-adjusted people that we are,

00:06:09.868 --> 00:06:12.712
because we've had to fight
with our siblings in our parents,

00:06:12.712 --> 00:06:15.962
and all these things that come 
from living in a smaller-knit space.

00:06:15.962 --> 00:06:18.592
And when you rob that sense
of community from our homes,

00:06:18.592 --> 00:06:20.202
what real purpose do they have?

00:06:20.205 --> 00:06:24.010
But McMansions ignore both of these
purposes to focus on a new purpose,

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.929
and that purpose was
the house is an asset,

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:30.195
the house was now becoming 
through series of,

00:06:30.195 --> 00:06:34.194
you know, deregulatory 
economic policies, etc,

00:06:34.194 --> 00:06:38.172
a liquid asset, it was money,
it was no longer a place to live,

00:06:38.172 --> 00:06:41.338
and it was seperated from the sense
of place and space that we know

00:06:41.338 --> 00:06:45.666
and consider our homes,
and so beautiful.

00:06:49.846 --> 00:06:52.835
McMansions don't follow 
the rules of traditional architecture,

00:06:52.835 --> 00:06:56.261
but really love to use 
the icons and the symbols,

00:06:56.265 --> 00:07:01.095
and shapes of the traditional architecture
like columns in windows styles,

00:07:01.096 --> 00:07:04.063
and the box with the roof,

00:07:04.063 --> 00:07:07.063
though the roof is three times
as big as the box.

00:07:07.065 --> 00:07:11.055
And in this case, you can see none 
of the windows actually match.

00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:14.554
Some have muntains which is the bits
that separate the panes of glass,

00:07:14.554 --> 00:07:15.874
and some don't,

00:07:15.883 --> 00:07:19.556
and most of all it looks like 
it is a screaming animal.

00:07:19.556 --> 00:07:21.216
(Laughter)

00:07:22.346 --> 00:07:26.826
So, there's no regard 
for basic matching, scale,

00:07:26.826 --> 00:07:29.472
you know, the rules of architecture,

00:07:30.152 --> 00:07:32.752
because they were designed 
mostly from the inside out,

00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:36.479
and mommy really needed
her cathedral ceilings in the bathroom.

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:41.254
You know sometimes that meant you
had a roof on that looked like this.

00:07:42.106 --> 00:07:44.623
Okay what's the point, right?

00:07:44.623 --> 00:07:48.255
Why do I even care about McMansions
if they are so horrible,

00:07:48.255 --> 00:07:52.439
and why do I write about them?
Well, it's about education.

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:56.237
60 percent of people according to the U.S.
census bureau live in the suburbs,

00:07:56.237 --> 00:08:00.546
and not all of us have access
to the fabric of our cities

00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:02.914
that have buildings from different eras,

00:08:02.914 --> 00:08:07.684
and all their beautiful details,
all interwoven into an urban fabric.

00:08:07.692 --> 00:08:10.756
Most of us have to live with,
you know, McMansions.

00:08:10.756 --> 00:08:12.944
And so it's about teaching 
with what you have,

00:08:12.944 --> 00:08:15.294
and also they're politically charged.

00:08:15.302 --> 00:08:18.812
They're sort of the poster child
of the recession,

00:08:18.816 --> 00:08:22.899
and they are attached to concepts 
like urbanism and sustainability

00:08:22.899 --> 00:08:25.215
and other things that 
make up a better world.

00:08:25.215 --> 00:08:27.101
You might be still
asking, "Okay, well,

00:08:27.101 --> 00:08:29.549
why not talk about you know
good architecture?"

00:08:29.549 --> 00:08:31.102
Well why so negative?

00:08:31.102 --> 00:08:33.502
I started writing
about architecture in high school

00:08:33.502 --> 00:08:35.003
to defend buildings like this.

00:08:35.003 --> 00:08:37.504
This is the Goshen Government
Centre by Paul Rudolph,

00:08:37.504 --> 00:08:40.935
in Goshen, New York which is undergoing,
what I like to call 'a murder.'

00:08:40.935 --> 00:08:43.245
(Laughter).

00:08:43.247 --> 00:08:46.377
I discovered, in the fight
for preservation of late modernist

00:08:46.377 --> 00:08:50.172
and post-modernist architecture
which is the part that I like,

00:08:50.632 --> 00:08:54.053
if you were on the side
of "I don't like this,"

00:08:54.053 --> 00:08:55.733
you have the advantage.

00:08:56.523 --> 00:08:59.671
People say, "Oh, I like this,"
and like, okay,

00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:03.198
but if you say, "I don't 
like this," then like why?

00:09:03.198 --> 00:09:05.738
And if you don't know why 
you're pretty much a jerk -

00:09:05.738 --> 00:09:08.293
but that gets people talking
and starts a disscusion

00:09:08.293 --> 00:09:13.314
and so in McMansion hell 
I saw this opportunity to explore,

00:09:13.314 --> 00:09:17.320
because a lof people hate McMansions
but they have no idea why.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.113
They're like, "I hate that,
it's big and it's ugly!",

00:09:20.113 --> 00:09:23.662
but they don't know what is 
so ugly about it or why it seems so big,

00:09:23.662 --> 00:09:27.348
and that's sort of where I come in,
and it brings me to my final point.

00:09:27.348 --> 00:09:29.863
It's about the greater purpose.

00:09:29.863 --> 00:09:32.632
So my professor at Peabody 
where I study acoustics

00:09:32.632 --> 00:09:34.584
has this saying that says,

00:09:34.584 --> 00:09:37.007
"The first step to good design 
is avoiding the bad,

00:09:37.007 --> 00:09:38.609
then you can design the good,

00:09:38.609 --> 00:09:41.621
and the first step to avoiding 
the bad is recognizing the bad."

00:09:41.621 --> 00:09:44.351
It's about looking at the world 
through a critical eye,

00:09:44.351 --> 00:09:48.011
and the best part about being snarky 
is that you are automatically critical.

00:09:48.011 --> 00:09:51.468
And so people can say,

00:09:51.468 --> 00:09:52.647
avoiding the bad, right?

00:09:52.647 --> 00:09:54.565
You don't want a house thet looks like

00:09:54.565 --> 00:09:56.795
the ginormous thing that's 
on the screen here.

00:09:56.795 --> 00:09:58.380
This is literally the McMansion,

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.960
it is a house that someone 
took to their little mouth

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.362
and blew up into a balloon.

00:10:03.362 --> 00:10:07.235
It's like they took the nice house
with the cable and (Puffs)

00:10:08.545 --> 00:10:11.716
Now if you know I don't like that,
and here's why I don't like that

00:10:11.716 --> 00:10:14.381
then I can start thinking 
about encouraging other people

00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:16.570
and educating them about
why I don't like that

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:17.761
and they don't like that.

00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:20.251
And maybe through this sort 
of education and design,

00:10:20.251 --> 00:10:23.390
getting people who don't care about
design to talk about design

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:27.550
is another really huge step 
in perpetuating better design.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:31.842
And so through using America's
ugliest and most hated houses,

00:10:31.845 --> 00:10:36.084
I mean, I'm sorry.

00:10:36.084 --> 00:10:37.794
We can...

00:10:37.794 --> 00:10:39.440
(Laughter)

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.972
In talking about them 
in a way that introduces humor

00:10:41.972 --> 00:10:45.354
so it's not, "I'm shoving my good design 
down your throat, dang you!"

00:10:45.354 --> 00:10:48.335
We can encourage people
through discussion, through education,

00:10:48.335 --> 00:10:49.666
through empowerment,

00:10:49.666 --> 00:10:54.749
to be a greater force for change,
and a change towards a more beautiful,

00:10:54.749 --> 00:10:57.626
a more sustainable, a more inclusive,

00:10:57.626 --> 00:11:00.793
and you know, a better-looking world.

00:11:00.793 --> 00:11:01.933
(Laughter)

00:11:01.933 --> 00:11:06.603
Or at least, prevent them 
from building more McMansions.

00:11:06.607 --> 00:11:07.978
Thank you!

00:11:07.978 --> 00:11:11.018
(Applause)
