00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:15.283
I'm an artist and an engineer.

00:00:15.307 --> 00:00:21.081
And lately, I've been thinking a lot
about how technology mediates

00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:23.146
the way we perceive reality.

00:00:23.653 --> 00:00:28.293
And it's being done
in a superinvisible and nuanced way.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.906
Technology is designed
to shape our sense of reality

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.741
by masking itself as
the actual experience of the world.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.116
As a result, we are becoming
unconscious and unaware

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.325
that it is happening at all.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.848
Take the glasses
I usually wear, for example.

00:00:47.872 --> 00:00:51.896
These have become part of the way
I ordinarily experience my surroundings.

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:53.842
I barely notice them,

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:57.951
even though they are constantly
framing reality for me.

00:00:58.447 --> 00:01:02.463
The technology I am talking about
is designed to do the same thing:

00:01:02.487 --> 00:01:04.925
change what we see and think

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.709
but go unnoticed.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.049
Now, the only time I do notice my glasses

00:01:11.073 --> 00:01:14.331
is when something happens
to draw my attention to it,

00:01:14.355 --> 00:01:17.869
like when it gets dirty
or my prescription changes.

00:01:18.481 --> 00:01:23.089
So I asked myself,
"As an artist, what can I create

00:01:23.113 --> 00:01:25.560
to draw the same kind of attention

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:31.755
to the ways digital media -- like news
organizations, social media platforms,

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:34.040
advertising and search engines --

00:01:34.064 --> 00:01:36.078
are shaping our reality?"

00:01:36.798 --> 00:01:41.570
So I created a series
of perceptual machines

00:01:41.594 --> 00:01:45.160
to help us defamiliarize and question

00:01:45.184 --> 00:01:47.304
the ways we see the world.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:54.892
For example, nowadays, many of us
have this kind of allergic reaction

00:01:54.916 --> 00:01:57.409
to ideas that are different from ours.

00:01:57.945 --> 00:02:03.601
We may not even realize that we've
developed this kind of mental allergy.

00:02:04.596 --> 00:02:10.239
So I created a helmet that creates
this artificial allergy to the color red.

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:14.716
It simulates this hypersensitivity
by making red things look bigger

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.020
when you are wearing it.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.288
It has two modes: nocebo and placebo.

00:02:21.272 --> 00:02:26.629
In nocebo mode, it creates this
sensorial experience of hyperallergy.

00:02:26.653 --> 00:02:29.360
Whenever I see red, the red expands.

00:02:30.062 --> 00:02:33.593
It's similar to social media's
amplification effect,

00:02:33.617 --> 00:02:36.214
like when you look at something
that bothers you,

00:02:36.238 --> 00:02:39.166
you tend to stick with like-minded people

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.785
and exchange messages and memes,
and you become even more angry.

00:02:44.274 --> 00:02:47.936
Sometimes, a trivial
discussion gets amplified

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.361
and blown way out of proportion.

00:02:51.038 --> 00:02:55.558
Maybe that's even why
we are living in the politics of anger.

00:02:56.756 --> 00:03:00.171
In placebo mode, it's
an artificial cure for this allergy.

00:03:00.575 --> 00:03:02.867
Whenever you see red, the red shrinks.

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:06.492
It's a palliative, like in digital media.

00:03:06.516 --> 00:03:09.415
When you encounter people
with different opinions,

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.916
we will unfollow them,

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.688
remove them completely out of our feeds.

00:03:14.343 --> 00:03:17.546
It cures this allergy by avoiding it.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.117
But this way of intentionally
ignoring opposing ideas

00:03:22.141 --> 00:03:26.197
makes human community
hyperfragmented and separated.

00:03:27.343 --> 00:03:30.402
The device inside the helmet
reshapes reality

00:03:30.426 --> 00:03:33.376
and projects into our eyes
through a set of lenses

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.315
to create an augmented reality.

00:03:35.935 --> 00:03:40.717
I picked the color red,
because it's intense and emotional,

00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:42.699
it has high visibility

00:03:42.723 --> 00:03:44.001
and it's political.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.653
So what if we take a look

00:03:45.677 --> 00:03:48.726
at the last American
presidential election map

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.915
through the helmet?

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:50.947
(Laughter)

00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:54.544
You can see that it doesn't matter
if you're a Democrat or a Republican,

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:58.557
because the mediation
alters our perceptions.

00:03:58.581 --> 00:04:01.714
The allergy exists on both sides.

00:04:03.134 --> 00:04:04.454
In digital media,

00:04:04.478 --> 00:04:07.611
what we see every day
is often mediated,

00:04:07.635 --> 00:04:09.368
but it's also very nuanced.

00:04:09.758 --> 00:04:11.753
If we are not aware of this,

00:04:11.777 --> 00:04:17.182
we will keep being vulnerable
to many kinds of mental allergies.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.410
Our perception is not only
part of our identities,

00:04:22.434 --> 00:04:26.728
but in digital media, it's also
a part of the value chain.

00:04:27.992 --> 00:04:31.567
Our visual field is packed
with so much information

00:04:31.591 --> 00:04:37.103
that our perception has become
a commodity with real estate value.

00:04:38.035 --> 00:04:41.564
Designs are used to exploit
our unconscious biases,

00:04:41.588 --> 00:04:45.068
algorithms favor content
that reaffirms our opinions,

00:04:45.092 --> 00:04:49.283
so that every little corner
of our field of view is being colonized

00:04:49.307 --> 00:04:50.649
to sell ads.

00:04:51.402 --> 00:04:55.419
Like, when this little red dot
comes out in your notifications,

00:04:55.443 --> 00:04:59.687
it grows and expands,
and to your mind, it's huge.

00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:03.932
So I started to think of ways
to put a little dirt,

00:05:03.956 --> 00:05:06.654
or change the lenses of my glasses,

00:05:06.678 --> 00:05:08.776
and came up with another project.

00:05:09.423 --> 00:05:13.224
Now, keep in mind this is conceptual.
It's not a real product.

00:05:13.676 --> 00:05:15.749
It's a web browser plug-in

00:05:15.773 --> 00:05:20.115
that could help us to notice
the things that we would usually ignore.

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:24.479
Like the helmet,
the plug-in reshapes reality,

00:05:24.503 --> 00:05:27.900
but this time, directly
into the digital media itself.

00:05:29.066 --> 00:05:32.222
It shouts out the hidden filtered voices.

00:05:32.246 --> 00:05:33.819
What you should be noticing now

00:05:33.843 --> 00:05:36.352
will be bigger and vibrant,

00:05:36.376 --> 00:05:40.671
like here, this story about gender bias
emerging from the sea of cats.

00:05:40.695 --> 00:05:42.716
(Laughter)

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.157
The plug-in could dilute the things
that are being amplified by an algorithm.

00:05:48.831 --> 00:05:50.527
Like, here in this comment section,

00:05:50.551 --> 00:05:53.620
there are lots of people shouting
about the same opinions.

00:05:54.111 --> 00:05:56.981
The plug-in makes
their comments super small.

00:05:57.005 --> 00:05:58.013
(Laughter)

00:05:58.037 --> 00:06:03.288
So now the amount of pixel presence
they have on the screen

00:06:03.312 --> 00:06:07.866
is proportional to the actual value
they are contributing to the conversation.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.832
(Laughter)

00:06:11.345 --> 00:06:14.976
(Applause)

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.980
The plug-in also shows the real estate
value of our visual field

00:06:21.004 --> 00:06:24.460
and how much of our perception
is being commoditized.

00:06:24.912 --> 00:06:26.501
Different from ad blockers,

00:06:26.525 --> 00:06:28.997
for every ad you see on the web page,

00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:32.428
it shows the amount of money
you should be earning.

00:06:32.452 --> 00:06:33.697
(Laughter)

00:06:34.356 --> 00:06:36.648
We are living in a battlefield
between reality

00:06:36.672 --> 00:06:38.925
and commercial distributed reality,

00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:44.415
so the next version of the plug-in
could strike away that commercial reality

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:47.238
and show you things as they really are.

00:06:47.262 --> 00:06:49.053
(Laughter)

00:06:50.335 --> 00:06:53.964
(Applause)

00:06:55.179 --> 00:06:58.791
Well, you can imagine how many directions
this could really go.

00:06:58.815 --> 00:07:03.229
Believe me, I know the risks are high
if this were to become a real product.

00:07:04.006 --> 00:07:06.945
And I created this with good intentions

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:10.806
to train our perception
and eliminate biases.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.558
But the same approach
could be used with bad intentions,

00:07:14.582 --> 00:07:17.787
like forcing citizens
to install a plug-in like that

00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:19.937
to control the public narrative.

00:07:20.768 --> 00:07:23.505
It's challenging to make it
fair and personal

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:26.684
without it just becoming
another layer of mediation.

00:07:27.933 --> 00:07:30.595
So what does all this mean for us?

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.963
Even though technology
is creating this isolation,

00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:38.589
we could use it to make
the world connected again

00:07:38.613 --> 00:07:41.860
by breaking the existing model
and going beyond it.

00:07:42.508 --> 00:07:45.846
By exploring how we interface
with these technologies,

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:51.055
we could step out of our habitual,
almost machine-like behavior

00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:53.749
and finally find common ground
between each other.

00:07:54.915 --> 00:07:56.704
Technology is never neutral.

00:07:57.191 --> 00:08:00.210
It provides a context and frames reality.

00:08:00.234 --> 00:08:03.122
It's part of the problem
and part of the solution.

00:08:03.624 --> 00:08:09.264
We could use it to uncover our blind spots
and retrain our perception

00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:13.455
and consequently, choose
how we see each other.

00:08:13.892 --> 00:08:15.083
Thank you.

00:08:15.107 --> 00:08:17.792
(Applause)
