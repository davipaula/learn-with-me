00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:11.329
Well. I hope you're all healthy

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:15.530
and I hope you all will remain healthy 
for the indefinite future.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.895
But that hope is a little bit unrealistic

00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:20.815
and so I've got a second back-up hope.

00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:24.105
This second back-up hope is that insofar 
as we have health problems,

00:00:24.476 --> 00:00:28.089
we will have good medicines
to take care of them.

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.729
Medicines are very cheap to produce
and they're very effective.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.569
Much more pleasant actually
than the alternatives:

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:39.645
hospitalization, operations, 
emergency rooms, the morgue...

00:00:39.645 --> 00:00:41.896
None of these are good things.

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:45.450
So we should be very grateful 
that we have pharmacologists around,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.367
people who research these things 
and develop new medicines,

00:00:48.743 --> 00:00:52.530
and we should be grateful that 
we have a pharmaceutical industry

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.329
that supports their activities.

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.692
But there is a problem
and you can tell from the fact

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:00.929
that the pharmaceutical industry
isn't well-loved.

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:05.846
In fact, in terms of popularity, 
they rank just about with the tobacco companies

00:01:05.846 --> 00:01:08.289
and the arms manufacturers.

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:12.369
So that's the problem that 
I want to talk about with you today.

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.289
How would you organize
the pharmaceutical industry?

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:18.646
If we did it all over again,
how would you do it?

00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:21.771
I think we would think
of three main principles.

00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:27.848
The first one is: we want patients 
to have access to all the important medicines.

00:01:27.848 --> 00:01:30.645
Remember, these things
are very cheap to produce.

00:01:30.645 --> 00:01:35.449
So everybody in the world should have access 
to all the important medicines.

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:39.170
Secondly, we want innovative activities,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.896
the research and development 
that pharmaceutical companies do,

00:01:42.896 --> 00:01:46.793
to track the diseases that are 
the most important, the most damaging.

00:01:46.793 --> 00:01:50.915
We want them to aim
for the greatest health impact.

00:01:50.915 --> 00:01:53.737
And thirdly, we want
the whole system to be efficient.

00:01:53.737 --> 00:01:58.438
We want as little of the money 
that goes into the system to go to waste.

00:01:58.438 --> 00:02:02.619
To go for overhead, for red tape, and so on.

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.899
Very simple three points.

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.699
Now, what about the existing system?

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:11.141
I think it does poorly
on all these three counts.

00:02:11.141 --> 00:02:13.855
First: Universal access.
Forget about it.

00:02:13.855 --> 00:02:18.416
The vast majority of human beings 
do not have access to medicines,

00:02:18.416 --> 00:02:21.494
at least not while they're still under patent.

00:02:21.494 --> 00:02:25.938
There are extremely high mark-ups 
and that's the problem.

00:02:25.938 --> 00:02:29.012
The problem is that even though 
these medicines are very cheap to produce,

00:02:29.012 --> 00:02:34.583
they cost a great amount of money 
during the time that they're under patent,

00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:39.254
and the reason for that is that rich people 
can pay a lot of money,

00:02:39.254 --> 00:02:41.779
pharmaceutical companies 
have a temporary monopoly,

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:45.294
they price for the rich,
they forget about the poor.

00:02:45.294 --> 00:02:48.177
The second problem is innovation.

00:02:48.177 --> 00:02:52.255
Again, we don't focus on the diseases 
that do the most damage,

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:56.748
and that's often put into the phrase
of the 10/90 gap.

00:02:56.748 --> 00:03:00.938
Ten percent of all the money spent 
on pharmaceutical research

00:03:01.015 --> 00:03:04.724
is focusing on diseases
that account for ninety percent

00:03:04.724 --> 00:03:06.618
of the global burden of disease.

00:03:06.618 --> 00:03:10.091
And vice versa: Ninety percent 
of the money is spent on diseases

00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:13.531
that account for only ten percent 
of the global burden of disease.

00:03:13.531 --> 00:03:18.252
So there's a huge mismatch between 
where we spend the research money

00:03:18.252 --> 00:03:21.412
and where the greatest problems are.

00:03:21.412 --> 00:03:24.371
Now, both these problems, 
the problem with innovation

00:03:24.463 --> 00:03:28.151
and the problem with access
have to do with this:

00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:30.332
The distribution of money in the world.

00:03:30.332 --> 00:03:31.816
It's extremely unequal.

00:03:31.816 --> 00:03:36.250
The blue area here is the top quarter 
of the human population.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.942
They have more than ninety percent 
of the global household income.

00:03:39.942 --> 00:03:43.011
The bottom half of humanity
on the other hand

00:03:43.011 --> 00:03:46.333
has not even three percent
of global household income.

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:50.539
So if you're a pharmaceutical company 
and you look for profit opportunities,

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:52.495
you look at this sort of chart and you say:

00:03:52.495 --> 00:03:55.224
"Well, where's the money? 
What am I gonna research?

00:03:55.224 --> 00:03:58.563
Who am I going to provide with medicine?"

00:03:58.563 --> 00:04:02.811
And again, that is in the context 
of there being only one way

00:04:02.811 --> 00:04:06.394
in which pharmaceutical companies 
make money under the present system,

00:04:06.394 --> 00:04:08.736
that is through patent-protected mark-ups.

00:04:08.736 --> 00:04:11.021
That's how they make their money.
Through mark-ups.

00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:13.096
And if you make money through mark-ups,

00:04:13.096 --> 00:04:18.390
then obviously you will go to 
where the people have the most income.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.144
Now in terms of overall efficiency,

00:04:21.144 --> 00:04:24.561
the system also does very, very poorly.

00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:27.175
A lot of money goes for lobbying politicians

00:04:27.175 --> 00:04:30.894
in order to extend patent periods 
to "evergreen", as it's called.

00:04:30.894 --> 00:04:32.897
Data exclusivity and so on.

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:38.019
A lot of money goes for gaming, where 
brand name companies pay generic companies

00:04:38.019 --> 00:04:40.309
to delay entry, for example.

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:44.227
A lot of money goes to take our patents 
into all the different jurisdictions.

00:04:44.227 --> 00:04:46.820
Money goes – even larger amounts –&nbsp;for litigation.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.626
They're litigating endlessly.

00:04:48.626 --> 00:04:50.572
Brand name company
against brand name company,

00:04:50.572 --> 00:04:52.737
brand name company
against generic company –

00:04:52.737 --> 00:04:54.466
enormous amounts go there.

00:04:54.466 --> 00:04:57.376
People say pharmaceutical companies
make a lot of profit.

00:04:57.376 --> 00:05:02.198
Well, yes and no, they do, but a lot of it 
goes to these wasteful activities.

00:05:02.198 --> 00:05:05.788
Deadweight losses, I won't even tell you 
what they are because it's too complicated.

00:05:05.788 --> 00:05:08.935
But there's also wasteful marketing.

00:05:08.935 --> 00:05:12.296
A lot of the money
that pharmaceutical companies make

00:05:12.296 --> 00:05:14.139
goes into advertising campaigns,

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.007
trying to win favor with doctors,

00:05:16.007 --> 00:05:18.676
trying to persuade patients
to try this medicine.

00:05:18.676 --> 00:05:21.536
And these marketing battles,
of course, are a pure waste,

00:05:21.536 --> 00:05:24.978
because what one company spends 
to get patients over to their drug

00:05:24.978 --> 00:05:27.508
another company spends to win them back.

00:05:27.508 --> 00:05:29.976
And then there is counterfeiting
in the developing countries.

00:05:29.976 --> 00:05:33.258
A lot of the drugs there, often more than 
fifty percent of what's sold,

00:05:33.258 --> 00:05:35.508
are counterfeit drugs where people say,

00:05:35.508 --> 00:05:39.175
"Because the drug is so expensive, 
I can offer you a cheaper version."

00:05:39.175 --> 00:05:40.760
But of course it's not the real thing.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.053
It's either diluted or it's completely inert.

00:05:43.053 --> 00:05:47.341
So on the whole, all the money 
that is spent on pharmaceuticals,

00:05:47.341 --> 00:05:50.340
and it's roughly a trillion dollars now,
per annum,

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.659
much of that money
is absolutely going to waste,

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:55.929
it's not going to where it should be going,

00:05:55.929 --> 00:05:58.090
namely to the development of new medicines

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.212
and to the manufacturing
of [the] ones we already have.

00:06:02.212 --> 00:06:04.589
Now, many people think
that the solution to the problem

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:08.253
is moral pressure
on pharmaceutical companies.

00:06:08.253 --> 00:06:11.776
And, sure, pharmaceutical companies 
have moral obligations

00:06:11.776 --> 00:06:13.508
just like we do.

00:06:13.508 --> 00:06:15.054
When we have to make a choice,

00:06:15.054 --> 00:06:17.926
often between having a little extra money 
and saving a human life,

00:06:17.926 --> 00:06:22.173
we often feel that we have
a duty to spend the money

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:23.926
and save the life.

00:06:23.926 --> 00:06:26.936
And why should pharmaceutical 
companies be any different?

00:06:26.936 --> 00:06:31.896
But really, it isn't realistic to expect 
pharmaceutical companies

00:06:31.896 --> 00:06:36.335
to act as well as you or maybe I might act.

00:06:36.335 --> 00:06:38.335
And the reason is threefold.

00:06:38.335 --> 00:06:43.096
One is that pharmaceutical companies 
are bound to their shareholders.

00:06:43.096 --> 00:06:46.536
The executive of such a company
wouldn't last very long

00:06:46.536 --> 00:06:51.064
if he gave a lot of money away,
or she, for good purposes,

00:06:51.064 --> 00:06:55.147
and thereby lost money
for the shareholders.

00:06:55.147 --> 00:06:57.016
They would be replaced.

00:06:57.016 --> 00:07:00.897
Also, pharmaceutical companies stand 
in fierce competition with one another

00:07:00.897 --> 00:07:04.063
and if you do more, if you are nicer 
than the other company,

00:07:04.063 --> 00:07:06.739
sooner or later, you'll be driven off the market.

00:07:06.739 --> 00:07:08.256
You will not survive.

00:07:08.256 --> 00:07:10.493
The other company will gain market share.

00:07:10.493 --> 00:07:15.936
And finally, remember, the entire industry 
is dependent for its income

00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:18.858
on one thing and one thing only: mark-ups.

00:07:18.858 --> 00:07:22.856
And ultimately you have to be sustainable.

00:07:22.856 --> 00:07:25.146
If you spend a lot of money
on helping poor people

00:07:25.146 --> 00:07:27.454
and you don't get paid for it,
you lose this money,

00:07:27.454 --> 00:07:32.536
you cannot continue
with your innovative activities.

00:07:32.536 --> 00:07:35.540
So for these reasons
it's just unrealistic to expect

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.904
that pharmaceutical companies will 
solve the problem on moral grounds.

00:07:39.904 --> 00:07:41.588
Who, then, should solve the problem?

00:07:41.588 --> 00:07:43.773
I suggest it has to be us.

00:07:43.773 --> 00:07:47.302
We, citizens and politicians,
have to do better

00:07:47.302 --> 00:07:50.099
in terms of regulating
the pharmaceutical industry,

00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:53.100
focusing them,
giving them the right incentives,

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.301
focusing them on the problems
that really matter.

00:07:57.301 --> 00:08:00.778
The potential gains here are enormous.

00:08:00.778 --> 00:08:04.385
About one third of all deaths
each day, each year

00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:08.698
are due to the diseases of [poverty]
in the developing world.

00:08:08.698 --> 00:08:14.338
Fifty thousand people every day 
die prematurely from these diseases.

00:08:14.338 --> 00:08:20.558
And that's not even counting all the diseases 
we know only too well in the rich countries.

00:08:20.558 --> 00:08:22.333
Cancer, heart disease and so on.

00:08:22.333 --> 00:08:24.898
Again, poor people die often much earlier,

00:08:24.898 --> 00:08:28.698
because they don't have good medical care 
including good medicines.

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:31.817
And even in rich countries,

00:08:31.817 --> 00:08:34.379
many patients are not getting
the best medicine.

00:08:34.379 --> 00:08:37.547
That's sometimes due to the fact 
that insurance companies won't cover it,

00:08:37.547 --> 00:08:40.345
because the prices are absolutely ridiculous,

00:08:40.345 --> 00:08:42.720
and it's also due, sometimes, to the fact

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.818
that doctors and patients
are falsely influenced

00:08:45.818 --> 00:08:49.899
by advertising campaigns
of pharmaceutical companies.

00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:53.096
So what can we do?
How can we change the system?

00:08:53.096 --> 00:08:56.736
I want to show you a way 
in which we can better incentivize

00:08:56.736 --> 00:09:00.592
pharmaceutical innovation and 
the provision [of] medicine

00:09:00.592 --> 00:09:02.582
to poor people and rich alike.

00:09:02.582 --> 00:09:04.863
And that is the Health Impact Fund.

00:09:04.863 --> 00:09:08.387
The Health Impact Fund is basically 
opening up the second track

00:09:08.387 --> 00:09:13.102
with which pharmaceutical innovators 
can be rewarded for their activities.

00:09:13.102 --> 00:09:14.663
They have a choice.

00:09:14.663 --> 00:09:16.798
They can either go with the old system,

00:09:16.798 --> 00:09:19.103
patent-protected mark-ups,

00:09:19.103 --> 00:09:21.583
or they can go with the new system,

00:09:21.583 --> 00:09:24.422
being rewarded on the basis
of the health impact

00:09:24.422 --> 00:09:26.824
of the medicine that they develop.

00:09:26.824 --> 00:09:30.110
And with each particular medicine,
they have their choice.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:34.455
So they can be partly on one track, 
partly on the other with different products.

00:09:34.455 --> 00:09:37.903
Now, how would the Health Impact Fund work?

00:09:37.903 --> 00:09:40.464
There would be
a fixed reward pool every year.

00:09:40.464 --> 00:09:42.787
We start with maybe six billion dollars,

00:09:42.787 --> 00:09:44.664
but that can eventually be revved up.

00:09:44.664 --> 00:09:46.385
Remember that the total money
that the world spends

00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:49.904
on pharmaceuticals is a trillion,
so it's a thousand billion,

00:09:50.096 --> 00:09:52.012
six billion is a drop in the bucket.

00:09:52.012 --> 00:09:54.856
It's relatively small
but it would work with six billion

00:09:54.856 --> 00:09:58.777
and we would get a lot of bang for the buck
if we introduced the Health Impact Fund

00:09:58.777 --> 00:10:00.740
with just six billion dollars.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.697
Any registered product,

00:10:02.697 --> 00:10:05.856
if you have a product and you want 
to register it with the Health Impact Fund,

00:10:05.856 --> 00:10:09.817
you will be rewarded for a period of ten years.

00:10:09.817 --> 00:10:14.375
During these ten years, you get a share 
of these annual reward pools,

00:10:14.375 --> 00:10:21.348
and that share would be proportional 
to your share of the health impact achieved

00:10:21.348 --> 00:10:23.348
by all these registered products.

00:10:23.348 --> 00:10:28.096
So if your product accounts 
for eight percent of the health impact

00:10:28.096 --> 00:10:30.014
of all the registered products,

00:10:30.014 --> 00:10:33.937
you get eight percent
of the reward money that year.

00:10:33.937 --> 00:10:36.904
That repeats for ten years
and at the end of the ten years,

00:10:36.904 --> 00:10:38.974
your product goes generic,

00:10:38.974 --> 00:10:43.457
so you basically lose
any further income from it.

00:10:43.457 --> 00:10:48.457
Each year, the health impact 
from your product would be evaluated

00:10:48.457 --> 00:10:51.377
and you would be paid on that basis.

00:10:51.377 --> 00:10:54.976
Now, if you take that reward
from the Health Impact Fund,

00:10:54.976 --> 00:10:57.897
you can't claim the other reward. 
You can't mark up the price.

00:10:57.897 --> 00:10:59.681
You have to sell at cost.

00:10:59.681 --> 00:11:01.296
What does that mean?

00:11:01.296 --> 00:11:04.264
Well, it doesn't mean
that the pharmaceutical company

00:11:04.264 --> 00:11:06.737
tells us what their cost is, but rather,

00:11:06.737 --> 00:11:09.776
our preferred way of determining
what the real cost is

00:11:09.776 --> 00:11:12.264
of making a medicine,
of manufacturing it,

00:11:12.264 --> 00:11:16.514
is to ask the registrant to put 
the production of the medicine

00:11:16.514 --> 00:11:21.264
out for tender, let generic companies 
compete for the production

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:24.508
and then the innovator
would buy the product

00:11:24.508 --> 00:11:26.293
from the cheapest supplier

00:11:26.293 --> 00:11:31.375
and would sell it at that same 
lowest possible price to patients.

00:11:31.375 --> 00:11:36.764
So the innovator would make no money 
at all on selling the product,

00:11:36.764 --> 00:11:42.351
but would make all its money 
from the health impact rewards.

00:11:42.351 --> 00:11:47.019
Now, how do we assess the impact 
of the introduction of a medicine?

00:11:47.019 --> 00:11:51.057
Well, we assess it relative
to the preceding state of the art.

00:11:51.057 --> 00:11:54.013
So some people before the medicine came along,

00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:55.374
had no treatment at all,

00:11:55.374 --> 00:11:58.614
now for the first time they have treatment, 
because it's cheap, people can afford it.

00:11:58.614 --> 00:12:04.258
So here, the impact is the difference 
between being treated and not being treated.

00:12:04.258 --> 00:12:08.097
In other cases, the new product 
is better than the old products

00:12:08.097 --> 00:12:11.432
and so a person gets
switched over to a better product

00:12:11.432 --> 00:12:16.180
and we pay for the impact, for the difference 
that the new product makes.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.909
If you have a product on the Health Impact Fund

00:12:18.909 --> 00:12:21.696
and you simply switch
somebody from an existing product

00:12:21.696 --> 00:12:24.678
to another product, to your product,
and it's no better,

00:12:24.678 --> 00:12:26.376
you get no money.

00:12:26.376 --> 00:12:28.764
That's in stark contrast to the existing system,

00:12:28.764 --> 00:12:31.139
where you get a lot of money
for switching somebody

00:12:31.139 --> 00:12:35.655
from one product to an equal product
that is your product.

00:12:35.655 --> 00:12:38.846
The Health Impact Fund does not pay for that.

00:12:38.846 --> 00:12:43.346
We quantify health impact in terms 
of quality-adjusted life years.

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:45.697
That method has been around
for about 20 years,

00:12:45.697 --> 00:12:47.378
and it's very easy to explain.

00:12:47.378 --> 00:12:50.093
Just think of a human life as a kind of plank,

00:12:50.093 --> 00:12:52.514
it's eighty inches long, one inch high,

00:12:52.514 --> 00:12:55.182
and when you die prematurely
before you reach 80,

00:12:55.182 --> 00:12:57.216
well, the plank is a little shorter.

00:12:57.216 --> 00:13:00.057
And if you're sick during
the time that you live,

00:13:00.057 --> 00:13:02.776
the plank is a little bit thinner.

00:13:02.776 --> 00:13:05.895
And what diseases can nibble away, 
well that, medicines can restore

00:13:05.895 --> 00:13:10.616
or medicines can avert
the taking away of these parts.

00:13:10.616 --> 00:13:15.514
And they get paid for that.
That's the method, basically.

00:13:15.514 --> 00:13:20.699
Now, we look – of course,
each year, we have to assess.

00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:22.417
We have to spend
a considerable amount of money

00:13:22.417 --> 00:13:25.875
looking at how these various medicines 
that are registered with the Health Impact Fund

00:13:25.875 --> 00:13:27.733
are doing in the various countries,

00:13:27.733 --> 00:13:30.218
and here, statistics is extremely helpful.

00:13:30.218 --> 00:13:33.460
You all know how exit polling works 
and this is a similar method.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:37.618
You look for a statistically significant sample,

00:13:37.618 --> 00:13:39.709
you look for a sample
and then you try to figure out

00:13:39.709 --> 00:13:42.738
what the health impact of the medicine 
is in different locations,

00:13:42.738 --> 00:13:44.628
in different demographic groups,

00:13:44.628 --> 00:13:47.817
and of course you look very carefully
at the actual world.

00:13:47.817 --> 00:13:51.817
This is in contrast to how medicines
are rewarded today.

00:13:51.817 --> 00:13:55.043
Sometimes, there is a reward
based on performance,

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:59.215
but it's the performance in clinical trials, 
in the laboratory, if you like,

00:13:59.215 --> 00:14:02.231
but not the performance in the real world.

00:14:02.231 --> 00:14:06.418
The Health Impact Fund
would look at real world impact,

00:14:06.418 --> 00:14:09.044
it would look not just at the quality of the drug,

00:14:09.044 --> 00:14:12.460
but also at how widely it is distributed,

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.658
whether the innovator manages
to target those patients

00:14:16.658 --> 00:14:19.257
who can benefit the most,

00:14:19.257 --> 00:14:22.865
and also, how well the drug is used in the field.

00:14:22.865 --> 00:14:26.107
So innovators would have much 
stronger incentives than they do now,

00:14:26.107 --> 00:14:29.229
to make sure that every patient
who takes the drug

00:14:29.229 --> 00:14:32.415
knows exactly how to take it to optimal effect.

00:14:32.415 --> 00:14:36.775
Today, most packaged inserts are 
not even translated into local languages

00:14:36.775 --> 00:14:43.078
and so it's not surprising that patients 
don't make the best use of the product.

00:14:43.078 --> 00:14:46.140
Now, how would the financing work?

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.941
Basically, the Health Impact Fund, as I said,

00:14:48.941 --> 00:14:51.022
could start with something like six billion dollars,

00:14:51.022 --> 00:14:53.342
it's not nothing, but it's also not a lot of money

00:14:53.342 --> 00:14:56.060
compared to what the world is already spending
on pharmaceuticals.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.827
So the best way to think of it
is as a new way of paying

00:14:59.827 --> 00:15:02.860
for what we are already paying for,
namely new medicine.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.470
You pay with one hand
through the tax system,

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:08.264
but you get something back,
with the other hand,

00:15:08.264 --> 00:15:11.061
because you also get
these medicines for cheap.

00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:12.470
This is not just for poor people.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:17.350
Everybody would have this Health Impact Fund 
registered medicine at cost,

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.667
at a very low price.

00:15:19.667 --> 00:15:23.385
Now, one very important hurdle,
politically, is,

00:15:23.385 --> 00:15:28.981
we have to make sure that we have 
longterm visibility for innovators,

00:15:28.981 --> 00:15:31.939
that innovators know
that the money is actually there,

00:15:31.939 --> 00:15:35.900
and so we need governments
to fund the Health Impact Fund,

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.581
because only governments can make 
predictable commitments

00:15:38.581 --> 00:15:40.821
for a long period of time.

00:15:40.821 --> 00:15:45.885
Because the Health Impact Fund
registration is voluntary,

00:15:45.885 --> 00:15:49.980
you basically have
a self-adjusting reward rate.

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:55.466
As the rate rises too high,
innovators will come in

00:15:55.466 --> 00:15:57.302
and drive the rate down.

00:15:57.302 --> 00:15:59.740
Conversely, if the rate falls too low,

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.503
innovators would be reluctant 
to register and the rate will recover.

00:16:03.503 --> 00:16:07.581
So the rate will always be
at a reasonable level.

00:16:07.581 --> 00:16:11.388
The Health Impact Fund
is beneficial for all parties.

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:14.224
It benefits innovators
by giving them a new market,

00:16:14.224 --> 00:16:19.081
and most importantly by overcoming 
their public relations problems

00:16:19.081 --> 00:16:20.886
that we started with.

00:16:20.886 --> 00:16:24.462
It benefits patients,
because patients are much more likely

00:16:24.462 --> 00:16:29.340
to get the right medicine, and also 
for these medicines to be developed,

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.388
the medicines that we most need.

00:16:31.388 --> 00:16:34.821
And it also benefits governments
or tax payers if you like,

00:16:34.821 --> 00:16:38.742
because it creates a permanent source 
of pharmaceutical innovation

00:16:38.742 --> 00:16:41.454
that will be here for all future times.

00:16:41.454 --> 00:16:44.634
It's a kind of machine that always 
directs pharmaceutical innovation

00:16:44.634 --> 00:16:46.821
to where we have the greatest problems,

00:16:46.821 --> 00:16:49.580
maybe for diseases
that don't even exist yet.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.715
The Health Impact Fund
will always channel innovation

00:16:52.715 --> 00:16:55.297
in the direction where it's most needed.

00:16:55.297 --> 00:16:57.820
Now, we have a little bit of help already.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:01.660
You can see here the number of people 
who have agreed to help us,

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.740
but we want your help as well.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:08.140
We want you to join us, 
maybe to talk with your government

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.940
to help us with publicity,

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:14.740
to help us with your ideas in perfecting 
the Health Impact Fund scheme,

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.467
and what we most urgently need
for the moment

00:17:17.467 --> 00:17:20.140
is to start a pilot.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:24.227
A pilot would introduce one medicine
into one jurisdiction

00:17:24.227 --> 00:17:27.018
on the Health Impact Fund model.

00:17:27.018 --> 00:17:32.098
The innovator would get paid according 
to the cost of the medicine for the sales,

00:17:32.098 --> 00:17:36.864
and would then get additional money 
on the basis of the health impact.

00:17:36.864 --> 00:17:42.502
Here, we need funding for the rewards, 
funding for the assessment,

00:17:42.502 --> 00:17:45.181
and in particular, we need political support

00:17:45.181 --> 00:17:51.859
to get politicians to support a pilot of that sort.

00:17:51.859 --> 00:17:58.466
If you have any further questions, don't hesitate 
to write us and contact us at this address.

00:17:58.466 --> 00:18:00.061
Thank you very much.

00:18:00.061 --> 00:18:02.107
(Applause)
