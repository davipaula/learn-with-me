00:00:12.754 --> 00:00:14.365
This weekend,

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:16.976
tens of millions of people
in the United States

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.278
and tens of millions more
around the world,

00:00:19.302 --> 00:00:22.231
in Columbus, Georgia, in Cardiff, Wales,

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:25.212
in Chongqing, China, in Chennai, India

00:00:25.236 --> 00:00:27.141
will leave their homes,

00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:30.363
they'll get in their cars
or they'll take public transportation

00:00:30.387 --> 00:00:33.022
or they will carry themselves by foot,

00:00:33.046 --> 00:00:34.799
and they'll step into a room

00:00:34.823 --> 00:00:37.490
and sit down next to someone
they don't know

00:00:37.514 --> 00:00:39.213
or maybe someone they do,

00:00:39.982 --> 00:00:42.799
and the lights will go down
and they'll watch a movie.

00:00:44.228 --> 00:00:47.506
They'll watch movies
about aliens or robots,

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.887
or robot aliens or regular people.

00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:54.416
But they will all be movies
about what it means to be human.

00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:58.958
Millions will feel awe or fear,

00:00:58.982 --> 00:01:01.782
millions will laugh and millions will cry.

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:04.482
And then the lights will come back on,

00:01:04.506 --> 00:01:07.688
and they'll reemerge into the world
they knew several hours prior.

00:01:08.014 --> 00:01:10.188
And millions of people
will look at the world

00:01:10.212 --> 00:01:13.189
a little bit differently
than they did when they went in.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.260
Like going to temple
or a mosque or a church,

00:01:18.284 --> 00:01:20.307
or any other religious institution,

00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:23.604
movie-going is, in many ways,
a sacred ritual.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.286
Repeated week after week after week.

00:01:28.318 --> 00:01:30.080
I'll be there this weekend,

00:01:30.104 --> 00:01:34.532
just like I was on most weekends
between the years of 1996 and 1990,

00:01:34.556 --> 00:01:36.506
at the multiplex, near the shopping mall

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.632
about five miles from my childhood home
in Columbus, Georgia.

00:01:40.038 --> 00:01:43.614
The funny thing is
that somewhere between then and now,

00:01:43.638 --> 00:01:46.085
I accidentally changed
part of the conversation

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:48.236
about which of those movies get made.

00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:53.331
So, the story actually begins in 2005,
in an office high above Sunset Boulevard,

00:01:53.355 --> 00:01:54.792
where I was a junior executive

00:01:54.816 --> 00:01:57.760
at Leonardo DiCaprio's
production company Appian Way.

00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:01.267
And for those of you who aren't familiar
with how the film industry works,

00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:04.626
it basically means that I was
one of a few people behind the person

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.080
who produces the movie for the people
behind and in front of the camera,

00:02:08.104 --> 00:02:10.839
whose names you will better
recognize than mine.

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:14.578
Essentially, you're an assistant movie
producer who does the unglamorous work

00:02:14.602 --> 00:02:17.363
that goes into the creative aspect
of producing a movie.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.149
You make lists of writers
and directors and actors

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:23.363
who might be right for movies
that you want to will into existence;

00:02:23.387 --> 00:02:25.910
you meet with many of them
and their representatives,

00:02:25.934 --> 00:02:27.994
hoping to curry favor
for some future date.

00:02:28.474 --> 00:02:30.386
And you read, a lot.

00:02:31.108 --> 00:02:33.164
You read novels that might become movies,

00:02:33.188 --> 00:02:35.363
you read comic books
that might become movies,

00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:37.434
you read articles
that might become movies,

00:02:37.458 --> 00:02:39.498
you read scripts that might become movies.

00:02:39.522 --> 00:02:42.656
And you read scripts from writers
that might write the adaptations

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.260
of the novels, of the comic books,
of the articles,

00:02:45.284 --> 00:02:48.162
and might rewrite the scripts
that you're already working on.

00:02:48.186 --> 00:02:50.587
All this in the hope of finding
the next big thing

00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:52.860
or the next big writer
who can deliver something

00:02:52.884 --> 00:02:56.079
that can make you and your company
the next big thing.

00:02:56.561 --> 00:03:01.650
So in 2005, I was a development executive
at Leonardo's production company.

00:03:01.963 --> 00:03:05.137
I got a phone call
from the representative of a screenwriter

00:03:05.161 --> 00:03:09.248
that began pretty much the way
all of those conversations did:

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:11.139
"I've got Leo's next movie."

00:03:11.761 --> 00:03:14.545
Now in this movie,
that his client had written,

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.125
Leo would play an oil industry lobbyist

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:20.122
whose girlfriend, a local meteorologist,
threatens to leave him

00:03:20.146 --> 00:03:22.376
because his work contributes
to global warming.

00:03:22.784 --> 00:03:25.291
And this is a situation
that's been brought to a head

00:03:25.315 --> 00:03:28.196
by the fact that there's a hurricane
forming in the Atlantic

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.585
that's threatening to do Maria-like damage
from Maine to Myrtle Beach.

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.664
Leo, very sad about
this impending break up,

00:03:33.688 --> 00:03:35.887
does a little more research
about the hurricane

00:03:35.911 --> 00:03:38.355
and discovers that in its path
across the Atlantic,

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.635
it will pass over a long-dormant,
though now active volcano

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:43.842
that will spew toxic ash into its eye

00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:46.931
that will presumably be whipped
into some sort of chemical weapon

00:03:46.955 --> 00:03:48.295
that will destroy the world.

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.495
(Laughter)

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.670
It was at that point that I asked him,

00:03:53.694 --> 00:03:56.847
"So are you basically pitching me
'Leo versus the toxic superstorm

00:03:56.871 --> 00:03:58.408
that will destroy humanity?'"

00:03:58.877 --> 00:04:00.646
And he responded by saying,

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.321
"Well, when you say it like that,
it sounds ridiculous."

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.082
And I'm embarrassed to admit
that I had the guy send me the script,

00:04:07.096 --> 00:04:10.958
and I read 30 pages before I was sure
that it was as bad as I thought it was.

00:04:10.982 --> 00:04:13.958
Now, "Superstorm"
is certainly an extreme example,

00:04:13.982 --> 00:04:16.125
but it's also not an unusual one.

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:19.718
And unfortunately, most scripts
aren't as easy to dismiss as that one.

00:04:19.742 --> 00:04:23.187
For example, a comedy
about a high school senior,

00:04:23.211 --> 00:04:25.349
who, when faced
with an unplanned pregnancy,

00:04:25.373 --> 00:04:28.503
makes an unusual decision
regarding her unborn child.

00:04:28.527 --> 00:04:30.053
That's obviously "Juno."

00:04:30.077 --> 00:04:32.860
Two hundred and thirty million
at the worldwide box office,

00:04:32.884 --> 00:04:35.017
four Oscar nominations, one win.

00:04:35.402 --> 00:04:37.799
How about a Mumbai teen
who grew up in the slums

00:04:37.823 --> 00:04:40.157
wants to become a contestant
on the Indian version

00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:42.014
of "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"?

00:04:42.038 --> 00:04:44.522
That's an easy one --
"Slumdog Millionaire."

00:04:44.546 --> 00:04:46.696
Three hundred seventy-seven
million worldwide,

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.813
10 Oscar nominations and eight wins.

00:04:49.323 --> 00:04:51.007
A chimpanzee tells his story

00:04:51.031 --> 00:04:53.738
of living with the legendary pop star
Michael Jackson.

00:04:54.585 --> 00:04:55.735
Anyone?

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:56.762
(Laughter)

00:04:56.786 --> 00:04:57.958
It's a trick question.

00:04:57.982 --> 00:04:59.817
But it is a script called "Bubbles,"

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:02.014
that is going to be directed
by Taika Waititi,

00:05:02.038 --> 00:05:03.942
the director of "Thor: Ragnarok."

00:05:04.483 --> 00:05:07.070
So, a large part of your job
as a development executive

00:05:07.094 --> 00:05:10.291
is to separate the "Superstorms"
from the "Slumdog Millionaires,"

00:05:10.315 --> 00:05:13.591
and slightly more generally,
the writers who write "Superstorm"

00:05:13.615 --> 00:05:16.231
from the writers who can write
"Slumdog Millionaire."

00:05:16.886 --> 00:05:20.332
And the easiest way to do this, obviously,
is to read all of the scripts,

00:05:20.356 --> 00:05:22.356
but that's, frankly, impossible.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.522
A good rule of thumb
is that the Writers Guild of America

00:05:25.546 --> 00:05:28.347
registers about 50,000 new pieces
of material every year,

00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:30.125
and most of them are screenplays.

00:05:30.442 --> 00:05:33.537
Of those, a reasonable estimate
is about 5,000 of them

00:05:33.561 --> 00:05:36.693
make it through various filters,
agencies, management companies,

00:05:36.717 --> 00:05:38.641
screenplay compositions and the like,

00:05:38.665 --> 00:05:40.959
and are read by someone
at the production company

00:05:40.983 --> 00:05:42.633
or major studio level.

00:05:42.657 --> 00:05:45.125
And they're trying to decide
whether they can become

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:48.672
one of the 300-and-dropping movies
that are released by the major studios

00:05:48.696 --> 00:05:50.387
or their sub-brands each year.

00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:51.583
I've described it before

00:05:51.607 --> 00:05:55.110
as being a little bit like walking
into a members-only bookstore

00:05:55.134 --> 00:05:58.094
where the entire inventory
is just organized haphazardly,

00:05:58.118 --> 00:06:00.776
and every book has the same,
nondescript cover.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.411
Your job is to enter that bookstore

00:06:03.435 --> 00:06:07.355
and not come back until you've found
the best and most profitable books there.

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:09.712
It's anarchic and gleefully opaque.

00:06:10.982 --> 00:06:13.895
And everyone has their method
to address these problems.

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:15.879
You know, most rely on the major agencies

00:06:15.903 --> 00:06:18.903
and they just assume
that if there's great talent in the world,

00:06:18.927 --> 00:06:21.172
they've already found
their way to the agencies,

00:06:21.196 --> 00:06:23.879
regardless of the structural barriers
that actually exist

00:06:23.903 --> 00:06:25.991
to get into the agencies
in the first place.

00:06:26.015 --> 00:06:28.545
Others also constantly compare
notes among themselves

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:30.559
about what they've read and what's good,

00:06:30.583 --> 00:06:33.730
and they just hope that their cohort group
is the best, most wired

00:06:33.754 --> 00:06:35.982
and has the best taste in town.

00:06:36.006 --> 00:06:39.073
And others try to read everything,
but that's, again, impossible.

00:06:39.553 --> 00:06:41.667
If you're reading
500 screenplays in a year,

00:06:41.691 --> 00:06:43.418
you are reading a lot.

00:06:43.442 --> 00:06:46.577
And it's still only a small percentage
of what's out there.

00:06:46.601 --> 00:06:48.529
Fundamentally, it's triage.

00:06:49.046 --> 00:06:52.331
And when you're in triage,
you tend to default to conventional wisdom

00:06:52.355 --> 00:06:54.624
about what works and what doesn't.

00:06:55.427 --> 00:06:59.323
That a comedy about a young woman
dealing with reproductive reality

00:06:59.347 --> 00:07:00.497
can't sell.

00:07:00.895 --> 00:07:04.602
That the story of an Indian teenager
isn't viable in the domestic marketplace

00:07:04.626 --> 00:07:06.879
or anywhere else in the world
outside of India.

00:07:06.903 --> 00:07:10.799
That the only source of viable movies
is a very narrow groups of writers

00:07:10.823 --> 00:07:14.028
who have already found their way
to living and working in Hollywood,

00:07:14.052 --> 00:07:16.743
who already have the best
representation in the business,

00:07:16.767 --> 00:07:19.606
and are writing a very narrow
band of stories.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.581
And I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit,
that that's where I found myself in 2005.

00:07:24.634 --> 00:07:26.864
Sitting in that office
above Sunset Boulevard,

00:07:26.888 --> 00:07:29.896
staring down that metaphorical
anonymized bookstore,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.206
and having read nothing
but bad scripts for months.

00:07:34.095 --> 00:07:36.119
And I took this to mean one of two things:

00:07:36.143 --> 00:07:38.547
either A: I was not very good at my job,

00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:41.214
which was, ostensibly,
finding good scripts,

00:07:41.238 --> 00:07:45.179
or B: reading bad scripts was the job.

00:07:45.203 --> 00:07:47.377
In which case, my mother's
weekly phone calls,

00:07:47.401 --> 00:07:50.451
asking me if my law school
entrance exam scores were still valid

00:07:50.475 --> 00:07:53.020
was something I should probably
pay more attention to.

00:07:53.044 --> 00:07:54.225
What I also knew

00:07:54.249 --> 00:07:56.735
was that I was about to go
on vacation for two weeks,

00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:59.500
and as bad as reading bad scripts is
when it is your job,

00:07:59.524 --> 00:08:01.246
it's even more painful on vacation.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.022
So I had to do something.

00:08:03.046 --> 00:08:05.237
So late one night
at my office, I made a list

00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:08.493
of everyone that I had had breakfast,
lunch, dinner or drinks with

00:08:08.517 --> 00:08:11.883
that had jobs similar to mine,
and I sent them an anonymous email.

00:08:11.907 --> 00:08:14.107
And I made a very simple request.

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:17.133
Send me a list of up to 10
of your favorite screenplays

00:08:17.157 --> 00:08:18.506
that meet three criteria.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.585
One: you love the screenplay,

00:08:20.609 --> 00:08:23.744
two: the filmed version of that screenplay
will not be in theaters

00:08:23.768 --> 00:08:25.403
by the end of that calendar year,

00:08:25.427 --> 00:08:28.374
and three: you found out
about the screenplay this year.

00:08:29.604 --> 00:08:33.366
This was not an appeal for the scripts
that would be the next great blockbuster,

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.323
not an appeal for the scripts
that will win the Academy Award,

00:08:36.347 --> 00:08:38.884
they didn't need to be scripts
that their bosses loved

00:08:38.884 --> 00:08:40.601
or that their studio wanted to make.

00:08:40.625 --> 00:08:43.687
It was very simply an opportunity
for people to speak their minds

00:08:43.711 --> 00:08:45.155
about what they loved,

00:08:45.179 --> 00:08:48.172
which, in this world,
is increasingly rare.

00:08:48.196 --> 00:08:52.032
Now, almost all of the 75 people
I emailed anonymously responded.

00:08:52.056 --> 00:08:55.149
And then two dozen other people
actually emailed to participate

00:08:55.173 --> 00:08:56.735
to this anonymous email address,

00:08:56.759 --> 00:09:00.307
but I confirmed that they did in fact
have the jobs they claimed to have.

00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:02.656
And I then compiled the votes
into a spreadsheet,

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.704
ran a pivot table,
output it to PowerPoint,

00:09:04.728 --> 00:09:06.688
and the night before I left for vacation,

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:08.617
I slapped a quasi subversive name on it

00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:11.133
and emailed it back
from that anonymous email address

00:09:11.157 --> 00:09:12.474
to everyone who voted.

00:09:12.498 --> 00:09:13.728
The Black List.

00:09:13.752 --> 00:09:17.371
A tribute to those who lost their careers
during the anti-communist hysteria

00:09:17.395 --> 00:09:18.926
of the 1940s and 50s,

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.839
and a conscious inversion of the notion

00:09:20.863 --> 00:09:23.863
that black somehow
had a negative connotation.

00:09:24.546 --> 00:09:27.332
After arriving in Mexico,
I pulled out a chair by the pool,

00:09:27.356 --> 00:09:30.268
started reading these scripts
and found, to my shock and joy,

00:09:30.292 --> 00:09:32.308
that most of them
were actually quite good.

00:09:32.332 --> 00:09:33.732
Mission accomplished.

00:09:34.048 --> 00:09:36.349
What I didn't and couldn't have expected

00:09:36.373 --> 00:09:37.907
was what happened next.

00:09:38.834 --> 00:09:40.914
About a week into my time on vacation,

00:09:40.938 --> 00:09:43.744
I stopped by the hotel's
business center to check my email.

00:09:43.768 --> 00:09:45.894
This was a pre-iPhone world, after all.

00:09:46.458 --> 00:09:49.641
And found that this list
that I had created anonymously

00:09:49.665 --> 00:09:52.117
had been forwarded back to me
several dozen times,

00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:53.642
at my personal email address.

00:09:53.666 --> 00:09:57.515
Everyone was sharing this list of scripts
that everyone had said that they loved,

00:09:57.539 --> 00:09:59.777
reading them and then
loving them themselves.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.474
And my first reaction,
that I can't actually say here,

00:10:03.498 --> 00:10:05.879
but will describe it as fear,

00:10:05.903 --> 00:10:08.157
the idea of surveying people
about their scripts

00:10:08.181 --> 00:10:10.615
was certainly not a novel or a genius one.

00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:13.982
Surely, there was some unwritten
Hollywood rule of omertà

00:10:14.006 --> 00:10:16.418
that had guided people
away from doing that before

00:10:16.442 --> 00:10:20.182
that I was simply too naive to understand,
it being so early in my career.

00:10:20.939 --> 00:10:22.693
I was sure I was going to get fired,

00:10:22.717 --> 00:10:25.907
and so I decided that day
that A: I would never tell anybody

00:10:25.931 --> 00:10:27.227
that I had done this,

00:10:27.251 --> 00:10:29.395
and B: I would never do it again.

00:10:30.919 --> 00:10:33.777
Then, six months later,
something even more bizarre happened.

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:36.434
I was in my office, on Sunset,

00:10:36.458 --> 00:10:39.242
and got a phone call
from another writer's agent.

00:10:39.266 --> 00:10:42.799
The call began very similarly
to the call about "Superstorm":

00:10:42.823 --> 00:10:44.855
"I've got Leo's next movie."

00:10:44.879 --> 00:10:46.895
Now, that's not the interesting part.

00:10:46.919 --> 00:10:49.339
The interesting part
was the way the call ended.

00:10:49.363 --> 00:10:53.128
Because this agent
then told me, and I quote,

00:10:54.188 --> 00:10:57.045
"Don't tell anybody, but I have it
on really good authority

00:10:57.069 --> 00:11:00.649
this is going to be the number one script
on next year's Black List."

00:11:00.673 --> 00:11:03.053
(Laughter)

00:11:03.077 --> 00:11:04.227
Yeah.

00:11:04.807 --> 00:11:06.910
Suffice it to say, I was dumbfounded.

00:11:07.284 --> 00:11:11.051
Here was an agent, using the Black List,
this thing that I had made anonymously

00:11:11.075 --> 00:11:12.925
and decided to never make again,

00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:14.615
to sell his client to me.

00:11:14.933 --> 00:11:16.782
To suggest that the script had merit,

00:11:16.806 --> 00:11:20.778
based solely on the possibility of being
included on a list of beloved screenplays.

00:11:21.541 --> 00:11:25.046
After the call ended, I sat in my office,
sort of staring out the window,

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:27.986
alternating between shock
and general giddiness.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.593
And then I realized that this thing
that I had created

00:11:30.617 --> 00:11:31.791
had a lot more value

00:11:31.815 --> 00:11:34.840
than just me finding good screenplays
to read over the holidays.

00:11:34.864 --> 00:11:37.069
And so I did it again the next year --

00:11:37.093 --> 00:11:40.268
and the "LA Times" had outed me
as the person who had created it --

00:11:40.292 --> 00:11:41.561
and the year after that,

00:11:41.585 --> 00:11:45.052
and the year after that --
I've done it every year since 2005.

00:11:45.076 --> 00:11:46.974
And the results have been fascinating,

00:11:46.998 --> 00:11:50.884
because, unapologetic lying aside,
this agent was exactly right.

00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:54.737
This list was evidence, to many people,
of a script's value,

00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:56.785
and that a great script had greater value

00:11:56.809 --> 00:11:59.634
that, I think, a lot of people
had previously anticipated.

00:11:59.658 --> 00:12:02.349
Very quickly, the writers
whose scripts were on that list

00:12:02.373 --> 00:12:03.910
started getting jobs,

00:12:03.934 --> 00:12:05.967
those scripts started getting made,

00:12:05.991 --> 00:12:07.406
and the scripts that got made

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.797
were often the ones
that violated the assumptions

00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:11.720
about what worked and what didn't.

00:12:11.744 --> 00:12:15.069
They were scripts like "Juno"
and "Little Miss Sunshine"

00:12:15.093 --> 00:12:17.641
and "The Queen" and "The King's Speech"

00:12:17.665 --> 00:12:18.815
and "Spotlight."

00:12:19.212 --> 00:12:21.037
And yes, "Slumdog Millionaire."

00:12:21.061 --> 00:12:24.189
And even an upcoming movie
about Michael Jackson's chimpanzee.

00:12:25.522 --> 00:12:28.625
Now, I think it's really important
that I pause here for a second

00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:32.094
and say that I can't take credit
for the success of any of those movies.

00:12:32.118 --> 00:12:36.118
I didn't write them, I didn't direct them,
I didn't produce them, I didn't gaff them,

00:12:36.142 --> 00:12:38.426
I didn't make food and craft service --

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:40.252
we all know how important that is.

00:12:40.276 --> 00:12:42.967
The credit for those movies,
the credit for that success,

00:12:42.991 --> 00:12:45.180
goes to the people who made the films.

00:12:45.204 --> 00:12:47.863
What I did was change
the way people looked at them.

00:12:47.887 --> 00:12:51.753
Accidentally, I asked
if the conventional wisdom was correct.

00:12:52.657 --> 00:12:56.045
And certainly, there are movies
on that list that would have gotten made

00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:57.237
without the Black List,

00:12:57.261 --> 00:12:59.649
but there are many
that definitely would not have.

00:12:59.673 --> 00:13:02.716
And at a minimum, we've catalyzed
a lot of them into production,

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.339
and I think that's worth noting.

00:13:04.363 --> 00:13:07.036
There have been about 1,000
screenplays on the Black List

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.926
since its inception in 2005.

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:11.418
About 325 have been produced.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.958
They've been nominated
for 300 Academy Awards,

00:13:14.982 --> 00:13:16.132
they've won 50.

00:13:16.934 --> 00:13:20.688
Four of the last nine Best Pictures
have gone to scripts from the Black List,

00:13:20.712 --> 00:13:24.513
and 10 of the last 20 screenplay Oscars
have gone to scripts from the Black List.

00:13:24.839 --> 00:13:27.141
All told, they've made
about 25 billion dollars

00:13:27.165 --> 00:13:28.750
in worldwide box office,

00:13:28.774 --> 00:13:31.473
which means that hundreds
of millions of people

00:13:31.497 --> 00:13:33.925
have seen these films
when they leave their homes,

00:13:33.949 --> 00:13:37.194
and sit next to someone they don't know
and the lights go down.

00:13:37.871 --> 00:13:40.643
And that's to say nothing
of post-theatrical environments

00:13:40.667 --> 00:13:43.516
like DVD, streaming and,
let's be honest, illegal downloads.

00:13:44.482 --> 00:13:48.418
Five years ago today, October 15,

00:13:48.442 --> 00:13:51.061
my business partner and I
doubled down on this notion

00:13:51.085 --> 00:13:55.482
that screenwriting talent
was not where we expected to find it,

00:13:55.506 --> 00:13:58.537
and we launched a website
that would allow anybody on earth

00:13:58.561 --> 00:14:00.743
who had written
an English-language screenplay

00:14:00.767 --> 00:14:02.783
to upload their script, have it evaluated,

00:14:02.807 --> 00:14:06.108
and make it available to thousands
of film-industry professionals.

00:14:06.132 --> 00:14:08.910
And I'm pleased to say,
in the five years since its launch,

00:14:08.934 --> 00:14:10.529
we've largely proved that thesis.

00:14:10.553 --> 00:14:13.799
Hundreds of writers from across the world
have found representation,

00:14:13.823 --> 00:14:15.633
have had their work optioned or sold.

00:14:15.657 --> 00:14:18.585
Seven have even seen their films made
in the last three years,

00:14:18.609 --> 00:14:20.252
including the film "Nightingale,"

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:22.688
the story of a war veteran's
psychological decline,

00:14:22.712 --> 00:14:25.379
in which David Oyelowo's face
is the only one on screen

00:14:25.403 --> 00:14:27.101
for the film's 90-minute duration.

00:14:27.125 --> 00:14:30.407
It was nominated for a Golden Globe
and two Emmy Awards.

00:14:30.431 --> 00:14:32.923
It's also kind of cool
that more than a dozen writers

00:14:32.947 --> 00:14:34.661
who were discovered on the website

00:14:34.685 --> 00:14:36.867
have ended up
on this end-of-year annual list,

00:14:36.891 --> 00:14:39.327
including two of the last three
number one writers.

00:14:39.351 --> 00:14:43.373
Simply put, the conventional wisdom
about screenwriting merit --

00:14:43.397 --> 00:14:46.960
where it was and where it could be found,

00:14:46.984 --> 00:14:48.349
was wrong.

00:14:48.373 --> 00:14:51.278
And this is notable,
because as I mentioned before,

00:14:51.302 --> 00:14:54.577
in the triage of finding
movies to make and making them,

00:14:54.601 --> 00:14:57.450
there's a lot of relying
on conventional wisdom.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:00.141
And that conventional wisdom,

00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:02.347
maybe, just maybe,

00:15:02.371 --> 00:15:04.632
might be wrong
to even greater consequence.

00:15:05.688 --> 00:15:08.220
Films about black people
don't sell overseas.

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:11.014
Female-driven action movies don't work,

00:15:11.038 --> 00:15:14.966
because women will see themselves in men,
but men won't see themselves in women.

00:15:16.188 --> 00:15:19.355
That no one wants to see movies
about women over 40.

00:15:19.379 --> 00:15:23.474
That our onscreen heroes have to conform
to a very narrow idea about beauty

00:15:23.498 --> 00:15:25.236
that we consider conventional.

00:15:26.291 --> 00:15:29.307
What does that mean when those images
are projected 30 feet high

00:15:29.331 --> 00:15:30.578
and the lights go down,

00:15:30.602 --> 00:15:33.307
for a kid that looks like me
in Columbus, Georgia?

00:15:33.331 --> 00:15:35.731
Or a Muslim girl in Cardiff, Wales?

00:15:36.117 --> 00:15:37.717
Or a gay kid in Chennai?

00:15:38.482 --> 00:15:41.181
What does it mean for how we see ourselves

00:15:41.205 --> 00:15:44.450
and how we see the world
and for how the world sees us?

00:15:47.308 --> 00:15:49.807
We live in very strange times.

00:15:50.413 --> 00:15:54.200
And I think for the most part,
we all live in a state of constant triage.

00:15:54.224 --> 00:15:56.574
There's just too much information,

00:15:56.598 --> 00:15:58.664
too much stuff to contend with.

00:15:58.996 --> 00:16:02.495
And so as a rule, we tend
to default to conventional wisdom.

00:16:03.292 --> 00:16:06.811
And I think it's important
that we ask ourselves, constantly,

00:16:06.835 --> 00:16:11.582
how much of that conventional wisdom
is all convention and no wisdom?

00:16:12.441 --> 00:16:13.591
And at what cost?

00:16:14.079 --> 00:16:15.231
Thank you.

00:16:15.255 --> 00:16:18.992
(Applause)
