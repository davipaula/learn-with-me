00:00:12.798 --> 00:00:14.837
So, here's a prediction.

00:00:15.346 --> 00:00:17.562
If we get our cities right,

00:00:17.586 --> 00:00:20.496
we just might survive the 21st century.

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:24.070
We get them wrong,

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:25.787
and we're done for.

00:00:26.307 --> 00:00:29.631
Cities are the most extraordinary
experiment in social engineering

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:31.982
that we humans have ever come up with.

00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:33.354
If you live in a city,

00:00:33.378 --> 00:00:35.567
and even if you live in a slum --

00:00:35.591 --> 00:00:38.420
which 20 percent of the world's
urban population does --

00:00:38.444 --> 00:00:41.206
you're likely to be healthier,
wealthier, better educated

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.747
and live longer than your country cousins.

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:48.069
There's a reason why three million people
are moving to cities

00:00:48.093 --> 00:00:49.312
every single week.

00:00:49.877 --> 00:00:53.052
Cities are where the future happens first.

00:00:53.664 --> 00:00:57.157
They're open, they're creative,
they're dynamic, they're democratic,

00:00:57.181 --> 00:00:58.332
they're cosmopolitan,

00:00:58.356 --> 00:00:59.671
they're sexy.

00:01:00.353 --> 00:01:04.446
They're the perfect antidote
to reactionary nationalism.

00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:08.461
But cities have a dark side.

00:01:09.013 --> 00:01:12.079
They take up just three percent
of the world's surface area,

00:01:12.103 --> 00:01:15.509
but they account for more than 75 percent
of our energy consumption,

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:18.633
and they emit 80 percent
of our greenhouse gases.

00:01:19.855 --> 00:01:24.056
There are hundreds of thousands
of people who die in our cities

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.929
every single year from violence,

00:01:25.953 --> 00:01:29.062
and millions more who are killed
as a result of car accidents

00:01:29.086 --> 00:01:30.615
and pollution.

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:32.723
In Brazil, where I live,

00:01:32.747 --> 00:01:37.006
we've got 25 of the 50 most homicidal
cities on the planet.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:40.844
And a quarter of our cities
have chronic water shortages --

00:01:40.868 --> 00:01:44.398
and this, in a country with 20 percent
of the known water reserves.

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.081
So cities are dual-edged.

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:49.051
Part of the problem is that,

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:52.434
apart from a handful of megacities
in the West and the Far East,

00:01:52.458 --> 00:01:55.812
we don't know that much
about the thousands of cities

00:01:55.836 --> 00:01:58.215
in Africa, in Latin America, in Asia,

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:02.154
where 90 percent of all future
population growth is set to take place.

00:02:03.026 --> 00:02:04.964
So why this knowledge gap?

00:02:05.537 --> 00:02:06.940
Well, part of the problem

00:02:06.964 --> 00:02:10.258
is that we still see the world
through the lens of nation-states.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.231
We're still locked
in a 17th-century paradigm

00:02:15.255 --> 00:02:17.542
of parochial national sovereignty.

00:02:18.606 --> 00:02:19.825
And yet, in the 1600's,

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.438
when nation-states were really
coming into their own,

00:02:22.462 --> 00:02:24.815
less than one percent
of the world's population

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:26.291
resided in a city.

00:02:26.315 --> 00:02:27.943
Today, it's 54 percent.

00:02:28.603 --> 00:02:30.928
And by 2050, it will be
closer to 70 percent.

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.816
So the world has changed.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.440
We have these 193 nation-states,

00:02:38.464 --> 00:02:41.874
but we have easily as many cities
that are beginning to rival them

00:02:41.898 --> 00:02:43.429
in power and influence.

00:02:43.453 --> 00:02:44.906
Just look at New York.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.741
The Big Apple has 8.5 million people

00:02:47.765 --> 00:02:51.002
and an annual budget
of 80 billion dollars.

00:02:51.026 --> 00:02:53.749
Its GDP is 1.5 trillion,

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:57.430
which puts it higher
than Argentina and Australia,

00:02:57.454 --> 00:02:59.386
Nigeria and South Africa.

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.710
Its roughly 40,000 police officers

00:03:02.734 --> 00:03:05.734
means it has one of the largest
police departments in the world,

00:03:05.758 --> 00:03:08.381
rivaling all but
the largest nation-states.

00:03:09.653 --> 00:03:11.674
But cities like New York

00:03:11.698 --> 00:03:12.880
or São Paulo

00:03:12.904 --> 00:03:14.124
or Johannesburg

00:03:14.148 --> 00:03:15.315
or Dhaka

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:16.512
or Shanghai --

00:03:16.536 --> 00:03:18.897
they're punching above
their weight economically,

00:03:18.921 --> 00:03:21.107
but below their weight politically.

00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:22.981
And that's going to have to change.

00:03:23.005 --> 00:03:25.673
Cities are going to have to find
their political voice

00:03:25.697 --> 00:03:27.300
if we want to change things.

00:03:28.131 --> 00:03:31.174
Now, I want to talk to you
a little bit about the risks

00:03:31.198 --> 00:03:32.415
that cities are facing --

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:33.741
some of the big mega-risks.

00:03:33.765 --> 00:03:36.963
I'm also going to talk to you briefly
about some of the solutions.

00:03:36.987 --> 00:03:39.435
I'm going to do this
using a big data visualization

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.922
that was developed with Carnegie Mellon's
CREATE Lab and my institute,

00:03:42.946 --> 00:03:44.540
along with many, many others.

00:03:44.564 --> 00:03:47.942
I want you to first imagine the world
not as made up of nation-states,

00:03:47.966 --> 00:03:49.530
but as made up of cities.

00:03:50.041 --> 00:03:52.326
What you see here is every single city

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.438
with a population
of a quarter million people or more.

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:58.001
Now, without going into technical detail,

00:03:58.025 --> 00:04:00.789
the redder the circle,
the more fragile that city is,

00:04:00.813 --> 00:04:03.076
and the bluer the circle,
the more resilient.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.156
Fragility occurs when
the social contract comes unstuck.

00:04:07.634 --> 00:04:11.054
And what we tend to see is a convergence
of multiple kinds of risks:

00:04:11.078 --> 00:04:12.357
income inequality,

00:04:12.381 --> 00:04:14.074
poverty,

00:04:14.098 --> 00:04:15.888
youth unemployment,

00:04:15.912 --> 00:04:17.751
different issues around violence,

00:04:17.775 --> 00:04:21.548
even exposure to droughts,
cyclones and earthquakes.

00:04:22.515 --> 00:04:25.693
Now obviously, some cities
are more fragile than others.

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:29.051
The good news, if there is any,

00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:31.751
is that fragility is not
a permanent condition.

00:04:31.775 --> 00:04:35.121
Some cities that were once the most
fragile cities in the world,

00:04:35.145 --> 00:04:36.536
like Bogotá in Colombia

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.152
or Ciudad Juárez in Mexico,

00:04:38.176 --> 00:04:40.908
have now fallen more
around the national average.

00:04:41.845 --> 00:04:44.260
The bad news is
that fragility is deepening,

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:47.387
especially in those parts of the world
that are most vulnerable,

00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:49.045
in North Africa, the Middle East,

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:50.659
in South Asia and Central Asia.

00:04:51.516 --> 00:04:56.369
There, we're seeing fragility rising
way beyond scales we've ever seen before.

00:04:56.945 --> 00:05:00.063
When cities become too fragile
they can collapse,

00:05:00.087 --> 00:05:01.516
tip over and fail.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.870
And when that happens,

00:05:02.894 --> 00:05:05.122
we have explosive forms of migration:

00:05:05.936 --> 00:05:07.165
refugees.

00:05:07.767 --> 00:05:11.761
There are more than 22 million
refugees in the world today,

00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:15.520
more than at any other time
since the second world war.

00:05:17.512 --> 00:05:19.923
Now, there's not one refugee crisis;

00:05:19.947 --> 00:05:21.774
there are multiple refugee crises.

00:05:21.798 --> 00:05:24.139
And contrary to what
you might read in the news,

00:05:24.163 --> 00:05:27.251
the vast majority of refugees
aren't fleeing from poor countries

00:05:27.275 --> 00:05:28.444
to wealthy countries,

00:05:28.468 --> 00:05:31.454
they're moving from poor cities
into even poorer cities --

00:05:31.478 --> 00:05:33.087
often, cities nearby.

00:05:33.815 --> 00:05:38.202
Every single dot on this map
represents an agonizing story

00:05:38.226 --> 00:05:40.014
of struggle and survival.

00:05:40.038 --> 00:05:42.848
But I want to briefly tell you
about what's not on that map,

00:05:42.872 --> 00:05:44.811
and that's internal displacement.

00:05:44.835 --> 00:05:48.643
There are more than 36 million people
who have been internally displaced

00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:49.835
around the world.

00:05:49.859 --> 00:05:52.354
These are people living
in refugee-like conditions,

00:05:52.378 --> 00:05:55.773
but lacking the equivalent international
protection and assistance.

00:05:55.797 --> 00:05:57.389
And to understand their plight,

00:05:57.413 --> 00:05:59.518
I want to zoom in briefly on Syria.

00:06:01.523 --> 00:06:06.178
Syria suffered one of the worst droughts
in its history between 2007 and 2010.

00:06:06.202 --> 00:06:10.144
More than 75 percent of its agriculture
and 85 percent of its livestock

00:06:10.168 --> 00:06:11.620
were wiped out.

00:06:11.644 --> 00:06:14.683
And in the process,
over a million people moved into cities

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:17.013
like Aleppo, Damascus and Homs.

00:06:17.832 --> 00:06:19.865
As food prices began to rise,

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:22.367
you also had equivalent levels
of social unrest.

00:06:23.384 --> 00:06:26.788
And when the regime of President Assad
began cracking down,

00:06:26.812 --> 00:06:29.210
you had an explosion of refugees.

00:06:30.347 --> 00:06:33.547
You also had over six million
internally displaced people,

00:06:33.571 --> 00:06:35.937
many of whom when on to become refugees.

00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:39.021
And they didn't just move
to neighboring countries like Jordan

00:06:39.045 --> 00:06:40.647
or Lebanon or Turkey.

00:06:41.172 --> 00:06:43.828
They also moved up north
towards Western Europe.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.466
See, over 1.4 million Syrians
made the perilous journey

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.213
through the Mediterranean
and up through Turkey

00:06:51.237 --> 00:06:53.602
to find their way
into two countries, primarily:

00:06:53.626 --> 00:06:55.427
Germany and Sweden.

00:06:57.048 --> 00:06:58.466
Now, climate change --

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.200
not just drought, but also sea level rise,

00:07:01.224 --> 00:07:04.169
is probably one of the most severe
existential threats

00:07:04.193 --> 00:07:05.484
that cities face.

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:08.580
That's because two-thirds
of the world's cities are coastal.

00:07:10.156 --> 00:07:15.392
Over 1.5 billion people live in low-lying,
flood-prone coastal areas.

00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:18.858
What you see here is a map
that shows sea level rise

00:07:18.882 --> 00:07:20.938
in relation to changes in temperature.

00:07:21.953 --> 00:07:24.361
Climate scientists predict
that we're going to see

00:07:24.385 --> 00:07:26.922
anywhere between three
and 30 feet of sea level rise

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:28.498
this side of the century.

00:07:28.522 --> 00:07:31.856
And it's not just low island nation-states
that are going to suffer --

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.220
Kiribati or the Maldives
or the Solomons or Sri Lanka --

00:07:35.244 --> 00:07:36.892
and they will suffer,

00:07:36.916 --> 00:07:38.907
but also massive cities like Dhaka,

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:40.766
like Hong Kong,

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.050
like Shanghai.

00:07:42.074 --> 00:07:45.125
Cities of 10, 20, 30 million
people or more

00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:48.485
are literally going to be wiped off
the face of this earth.

00:07:48.984 --> 00:07:51.709
They're going to have to adapt,
or they're going to die.

00:07:52.683 --> 00:07:55.240
I want to take you also
all the way over to the West,

00:07:55.264 --> 00:07:58.555
because this isn't just a problem
in Asia or Africa or Latin America,

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:00.396
this is a problem also in the West.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.576
This is Miami.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.171
Many of you know Miami
is one of the wealthiest cities

00:08:04.195 --> 00:08:05.348
in the United States;

00:08:05.372 --> 00:08:07.210
it's also one of the most flood-prone.

00:08:07.234 --> 00:08:10.664
That's been made painfully evident
by natural disasters throughout 2017.

00:08:10.688 --> 00:08:13.096
But Miami is built
on porous limestone -- a swamp.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.096
There's no way any kind of flood barrier

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.456
is going to keep
the water from seeping in.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.686
As we scroll back,

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:21.402
and we look across the Caribbean
and along the Gulf,

00:08:21.426 --> 00:08:22.580
we begin to realize

00:08:22.604 --> 00:08:25.720
that those cities that have suffered
worst from natural crises --

00:08:25.744 --> 00:08:28.748
Port-au-Prince, New Orleans, Houston --

00:08:28.772 --> 00:08:31.371
as severe and as awful
as those situations have been,

00:08:31.395 --> 00:08:33.863
they're a dress rehearsal
for what's to come.

00:08:34.855 --> 00:08:36.536
No city is an island.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.816
Every city is connected
to its rural hinterland

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.992
in complex ways --

00:08:40.016 --> 00:08:42.818
often, in relation
to the production of food.

00:08:42.842 --> 00:08:46.216
I want to take you to the northern part
of the Amazon, in Rondônia.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.121
This is one of the world's largest
terrestrial carbon sinks,

00:08:49.145 --> 00:08:51.407
processing millions of carbon
every single year.

00:08:51.431 --> 00:08:54.276
What you see here is a single road
over a 30-year period.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.165
On either side you see land being
cleared for pasture, for cattle,

00:08:58.189 --> 00:09:00.384
but also for soy and sugar production.

00:09:00.981 --> 00:09:03.606
You're seeing deforestation
on a massive scale.

00:09:04.673 --> 00:09:09.236
The red area here implies a net loss
of forest over the last 14 years.

00:09:09.854 --> 00:09:12.401
The blue, if you could see it --
there's not much --

00:09:12.425 --> 00:09:14.490
implies there's been an incremental gain.

00:09:15.275 --> 00:09:19.296
Now, as grim and gloomy
as the situation is -- and it is --

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.886
there is a little bit of hope.

00:09:21.366 --> 00:09:22.858
See, the Brazilian government,

00:09:22.882 --> 00:09:25.449
from the national to the state
to the municipal level,

00:09:25.473 --> 00:09:29.290
has also introduced a whole range --
a lattice -- of parks and protected areas.

00:09:29.314 --> 00:09:32.290
And while not perfect,
and not always limiting encroachment,

00:09:32.314 --> 00:09:35.249
they have served
to tamp back deforestation.

00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:39.019
The same applies not just in Brazil
but all across the Americas,

00:09:39.043 --> 00:09:41.571
into the United States, Canada
and around the world.

00:09:41.595 --> 00:09:43.691
So let's talk about solutions.

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:48.389
Despite climate denial
at the highest levels,

00:09:48.413 --> 00:09:50.222
cities are taking action.

00:09:50.246 --> 00:09:53.665
You know, when the US pulled out
of the Paris Climate Agreement,

00:09:53.689 --> 00:09:57.323
hundreds of cities in the United States
and thousands more around the world

00:09:57.347 --> 00:09:59.424
doubled down on their climate commitments.

00:10:00.005 --> 00:10:03.619
(Applause)

00:10:06.924 --> 00:10:11.361
And when the White House cracked down
on so-called "undocumented migrants"

00:10:11.385 --> 00:10:12.580
in sanctuary cities,

00:10:12.604 --> 00:10:15.567
hundreds of cities and counties
and states sat up in defiance

00:10:15.591 --> 00:10:17.682
and refused to enact that order.

00:10:17.706 --> 00:10:20.883
(Applause)

00:10:22.033 --> 00:10:24.747
So cities are and can take action.

00:10:25.731 --> 00:10:28.573
But we're going to need
to see a lot more of it,

00:10:28.597 --> 00:10:30.523
especially in the global south.

00:10:30.547 --> 00:10:34.337
You see, parts of Africa
and Latin America are urbanizing

00:10:34.361 --> 00:10:35.713
before they industrialize.

00:10:35.737 --> 00:10:38.187
They're growing at three times
the global average

00:10:38.211 --> 00:10:39.674
in terms their population.

00:10:40.532 --> 00:10:43.956
And this is putting enormous strain
on infrastructure and services.

00:10:44.514 --> 00:10:47.645
Now, there is a golden opportunity.

00:10:48.134 --> 00:10:51.459
It's a small opportunity but a golden one:
in the next 10 to 20 years,

00:10:51.483 --> 00:10:55.027
to really start designing in
principles of resilience into our cities.

00:10:55.051 --> 00:10:57.516
There's not one single way of doing this,

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:00.333
but there are a number of ways
that are emerging.

00:11:00.357 --> 00:11:02.970
And I've spoken with hundreds
of urban planners,

00:11:02.994 --> 00:11:04.428
development specialists,

00:11:04.452 --> 00:11:06.820
architects and civic activists,

00:11:06.844 --> 00:11:09.487
and a number of recurring
principles keep coming out.

00:11:09.511 --> 00:11:11.301
I just want to pass on six.

00:11:12.186 --> 00:11:14.977
First: cities need a plan

00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:16.874
and a strategy to implement it.

00:11:16.898 --> 00:11:18.117
I mean, it sounds crazy,

00:11:18.141 --> 00:11:21.248
but the vast majority of world cities
don't actually have a plan

00:11:21.272 --> 00:11:22.427
or a vision.

00:11:22.451 --> 00:11:25.785
They're too busy putting out daily fires
to think ahead strategically.

00:11:25.809 --> 00:11:27.818
I mean, every city wants to be creative,

00:11:27.842 --> 00:11:30.208
happy, liveable, resilient --

00:11:30.232 --> 00:11:31.510
who doesn't?

00:11:31.534 --> 00:11:33.404
The challenge is, how do you get there?

00:11:33.428 --> 00:11:35.668
And urban governance plays a key role.

00:11:35.692 --> 00:11:38.716
You could do worse than take a page
from the book of Singapore.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.979
In 1971, Singapore set
a 50-year urban strategy

00:11:42.003 --> 00:11:44.321
and renews it every five years.

00:11:45.189 --> 00:11:48.720
What Singapore teaches us
is not just the importance of continuity,

00:11:48.744 --> 00:11:51.991
but also the critical role
of autonomy and discretion.

00:11:52.747 --> 00:11:55.772
Cities need the power
to be able to issue debt,

00:11:55.796 --> 00:11:57.010
to raise taxes,

00:11:57.034 --> 00:11:58.185
to zone effectively,

00:11:58.209 --> 00:11:59.865
to build affordable housing.

00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:05.498
What cities need is nothing less
than a devolution revolution,

00:12:05.522 --> 00:12:08.738
and this is going to require
renegotiating the terms of the contract

00:12:08.762 --> 00:12:10.121
with a nation-state.

00:12:10.765 --> 00:12:12.039
Second:

00:12:12.063 --> 00:12:13.754
you've got to go green.

00:12:13.778 --> 00:12:16.841
Cities are already leading
global decarbonization efforts.

00:12:16.865 --> 00:12:19.127
They're investing in congestion
pricing schemes,

00:12:19.151 --> 00:12:21.476
in climate reduction emission targets,

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.460
in biodiversity, in parks
and bikeways and walkways

00:12:25.484 --> 00:12:26.743
and everything in between.

00:12:26.767 --> 00:12:29.920
There's an extraordinary menu of options
they have to choose from.

00:12:29.944 --> 00:12:31.238
One of the great things is,

00:12:31.262 --> 00:12:34.783
cities are already investing heavily
in renewables -- in solar and wind --

00:12:34.807 --> 00:12:38.540
not just in North America, but especially
in Western Europe and parts of Asia.

00:12:38.564 --> 00:12:41.467
There are more than 8,000 cities
right now in the world today

00:12:41.491 --> 00:12:42.661
with solar plants.

00:12:42.685 --> 00:12:46.884
There are 300 cities that have declared
complete energy autonomy.

00:12:46.908 --> 00:12:49.311
One of my favorite stories
comes from Medellín,

00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:52.468
which invested in a municipal
hydroelectric plant,

00:12:52.492 --> 00:12:54.720
which doesn't only service
its local needs,

00:12:54.744 --> 00:12:58.067
but allows the city to sell excess energy
back onto the national grid.

00:12:58.091 --> 00:12:59.259
And it's not alone.

00:12:59.283 --> 00:13:01.819
There are a thousand
other cities just like it.

00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:06.179
Third: invest in integrated
and multi-use solutions.

00:13:06.956 --> 00:13:10.525
The most successful cities are those
that are going to invest in solutions

00:13:10.549 --> 00:13:13.784
that don't solve just one problem,
but that solve multiple problems.

00:13:13.808 --> 00:13:17.010
Take the case of integrated
public transport.

00:13:17.704 --> 00:13:19.018
When done well --

00:13:19.042 --> 00:13:20.427
rapid bus transit,

00:13:20.451 --> 00:13:21.794
light rail,

00:13:21.818 --> 00:13:24.223
bikeways, walkways, boatways --

00:13:24.247 --> 00:13:27.593
these can dramatically reduce
emissions and congestion.

00:13:28.297 --> 00:13:30.154
But they can do a lot more than that.

00:13:30.178 --> 00:13:31.853
They can improve public health.

00:13:31.877 --> 00:13:33.521
They can reduce dispersion.

00:13:33.545 --> 00:13:35.174
They can even increase safety.

00:13:36.109 --> 00:13:38.104
A great example of this comes from Seoul.

00:13:38.128 --> 00:13:42.109
You see, Seoul's population doubled
over the last 30 years,

00:13:42.133 --> 00:13:44.329
but the footprint barely changed.

00:13:44.353 --> 00:13:45.754
How?

00:13:45.778 --> 00:13:48.613
Well, 75 percent
of Seoul's residents get to work

00:13:48.637 --> 00:13:50.076
using what's been described as

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.674
one of the most extraordinary
public transport systems

00:13:52.698 --> 00:13:53.849
in the world.

00:13:53.873 --> 00:13:55.573
And Seoul used to be car country.

00:13:56.859 --> 00:13:58.297
Next, fourth:

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.342
build densely but also sustainably.

00:14:03.057 --> 00:14:06.158
The death of all cities is the sprawl.

00:14:06.667 --> 00:14:08.842
Cities need to know
how to build resiliently,

00:14:08.866 --> 00:14:10.657
but also in a way that's inclusive.

00:14:11.095 --> 00:14:14.846
This is a picture right here
of Dallas-Fort Worth.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:19.184
And what you see is its population
also doubled over the last 30 years.

00:14:19.832 --> 00:14:22.962
But as you can see, it spread
into edge cities and suburbia

00:14:22.986 --> 00:14:24.596
as far as the eye can see.

00:14:25.121 --> 00:14:27.331
Cities need to know when not to build,

00:14:27.355 --> 00:14:29.686
so as not to reproduce urban sprawl

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.650
and slums of downward accountability.

00:14:32.377 --> 00:14:34.337
The problem with Dallas-Forth Worth is

00:14:34.361 --> 00:14:39.118
just five percent of its residents get
to work using public transport -- five.

00:14:39.142 --> 00:14:40.600
Ninety-five percent use cars,

00:14:40.624 --> 00:14:44.039
which partly explains why it's got
some of the longest commuting times

00:14:44.063 --> 00:14:45.364
in North America.

00:14:45.388 --> 00:14:47.453
Singapore, by contrast, got it right.

00:14:47.477 --> 00:14:48.644
They built vertically

00:14:48.668 --> 00:14:50.631
and built in affordable housing to boot.

00:14:51.989 --> 00:14:53.832
Fifth: steal.

00:14:54.987 --> 00:14:57.604
The smartest cities are nicking,
pilfering, stealing,

00:14:57.628 --> 00:14:58.788
left, right and center.

00:14:58.812 --> 00:15:00.296
They don't have time to waste.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.303
They need tomorrow's technology today,

00:15:02.327 --> 00:15:04.332
and they're going
to leapfrog to get there.

00:15:04.356 --> 00:15:05.511
This is New York,

00:15:05.535 --> 00:15:08.369
but it's not just New York
that's doing a lot of stealing,

00:15:08.393 --> 00:15:10.457
it's Singapore, it's Seoul, it's Medellín.

00:15:10.481 --> 00:15:12.818
The urban renaissance
is only going to be enabled

00:15:12.842 --> 00:15:15.017
when cities start borrowing
from one another.

00:15:15.041 --> 00:15:17.566
And finally: work in global coalitions.

00:15:18.008 --> 00:15:21.648
You know, there are more than 200
inner-city coalitions in the world today.

00:15:21.672 --> 00:15:23.219
There are more city coalitions

00:15:23.243 --> 00:15:25.577
than there are coalitions
for nation-states.

00:15:26.272 --> 00:15:28.775
Just take a look at the Global
Parliament of Mayors,

00:15:28.799 --> 00:15:30.248
set up by the late Ben Barber,

00:15:30.272 --> 00:15:32.313
who was driving an urban rights movement.

00:15:32.337 --> 00:15:33.831
Or consider the C40,

00:15:33.855 --> 00:15:37.266
a marvelous network of cities
that has gathered thousands together

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:38.727
to deliver clean energy.

00:15:39.092 --> 00:15:40.855
Or look at the World Economic Forum,

00:15:40.879 --> 00:15:42.876
which is developing smart city protocols.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.782
Or the 100 Resilient Cities initiative,

00:15:44.806 --> 00:15:46.809
which is leading a resilience revival.

00:15:47.945 --> 00:15:51.426
ICLEI, UCLG, Metropolis --

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:54.127
these are the movements of the future.

00:15:54.151 --> 00:15:56.937
What they all realize
is that when cities work together,

00:15:56.961 --> 00:15:58.818
they can amplify their voice,

00:15:59.499 --> 00:16:02.494
not just on the national stage,
but on the global stage.

00:16:02.518 --> 00:16:05.421
And with a voice comes,
potentially, a vote --

00:16:05.445 --> 00:16:07.214
and then maybe even a veto.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:12.681
When nation-states default
on their national sovereignty,

00:16:12.705 --> 00:16:14.587
cities have to step up.

00:16:14.611 --> 00:16:15.763
They can't wait.

00:16:15.787 --> 00:16:17.969
And they don't need to ask for permission.

00:16:17.993 --> 00:16:20.344
They can exert their own sovereignty.

00:16:21.037 --> 00:16:23.168
They understand
that the local and the global

00:16:23.192 --> 00:16:24.794
have really, truly come together,

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:26.674
that we live in a global, local world,

00:16:26.698 --> 00:16:29.347
and we need to adjust
our politics accordingly.

00:16:29.371 --> 00:16:32.479
As I travel around the world
and meet mayors and civic leaders,

00:16:32.503 --> 00:16:35.829
I'm amazed by the energy,
enthusiasm and effectiveness

00:16:35.853 --> 00:16:37.664
they bring to their work.

00:16:37.688 --> 00:16:39.172
They're pragmatists.

00:16:39.196 --> 00:16:40.730
They're problem-solvers.

00:16:40.754 --> 00:16:42.223
They're para-diplomats.

00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:46.239
And in this moment of extraordinary
international uncertainty,

00:16:47.116 --> 00:16:49.624
when our multilateral
institutions are paralyzed

00:16:49.648 --> 00:16:51.717
and our nation-states are in retreat,

00:16:51.741 --> 00:16:56.458
cities and their leaders are our new
21st-century visionaries.

00:16:57.254 --> 00:17:01.003
They deserve -- no, they have
a right to -- a seat at the table.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.049
Thank you.

00:17:03.073 --> 00:17:06.591
(Applause)
