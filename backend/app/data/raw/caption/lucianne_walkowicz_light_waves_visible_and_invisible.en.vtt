00:00:07.098 --> 00:00:09.959
What if you could only see one color?

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:11.584
Imagine, for instance,

00:00:11.584 --> 00:00:13.738
that you could only see things that were red

00:00:13.738 --> 00:00:14.869
and that everything else

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.106
was completely invisible to you.

00:00:17.106 --> 00:00:18.139
As it turns out,

00:00:18.139 --> 00:00:20.414
that's how you live your life all the time

00:00:20.414 --> 00:00:21.919
because your eyes can only see

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.084
a minuscule part of the full spectrum of light.

00:00:25.084 --> 00:00:28.183
Different kinds of light are all around you everyday

00:00:28.183 --> 00:00:30.101
but are invisible to the human eye,

00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:32.940
from the radio waves that carry your favorite songs,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.475
to the x-rays doctors use to see inside of you,

00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:37.939
to the microwaves that heat up your food.

00:00:38.554 --> 00:00:39.682
In order to understand

00:00:39.682 --> 00:00:41.243
how these can all be light,

00:00:41.243 --> 00:00:42.656
we'll need to know a thing or two

00:00:42.656 --> 00:00:44.284
about what light is.

00:00:44.284 --> 00:00:46.519
Light is electromagnetic radiation

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:49.037
that acts like both a wave and a particle.

00:00:49.037 --> 00:00:52.028
Light waves are kind of like waves on the ocean.

00:00:52.028 --> 00:00:53.991
There are big waves and small waves,

00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:55.698
waves that crash on the shore

00:00:55.698 --> 00:00:57.235
one right after the other,

00:00:57.235 --> 00:01:00.155
and waves that only roll in every so often.

00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:02.992
The size of a wave is called its wavelength,

00:01:02.992 --> 00:01:04.498
and how often it comes by

00:01:04.498 --> 00:01:06.393
is called its frequency.

00:01:06.793 --> 00:01:08.748
Imagine being a boat in that ocean,

00:01:08.748 --> 00:01:11.231
bobbing up and down as the waves go by.

00:01:11.231 --> 00:01:13.667
If the waves that day have long wavelengths,

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:15.789
they'll make you bob only so often,

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:17.696
or at a low frequency.

00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:20.058
If the waves, instead, have short wavelengths,

00:01:20.058 --> 00:01:21.308
they'll be close together,

00:01:21.308 --> 00:01:23.535
and you'll bob up and down much more often,

00:01:23.535 --> 00:01:25.286
at a high frequency.

00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:27.902
Different kinds of light are all waves,

00:01:27.902 --> 00:01:30.406
they just have different wavelengths and frequencies.

00:01:31.298 --> 00:01:33.195
If you know the wavelength or frequency

00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:34.323
of a wave of light,

00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:36.787
you can also figure out its energy.

00:01:36.787 --> 00:01:39.002
Long wavelengths have low energies,

00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:41.230
while short wavelengths have high energies.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.673
It's easy to remember

00:01:42.673 --> 00:01:44.727
if you think about being in that boat.

00:01:44.727 --> 00:01:46.428
If you were out sailing on a day

00:01:46.428 --> 00:01:47.975
with short, choppy waves,

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:50.398
you'd probably be pretty high energy yourself,

00:01:50.398 --> 00:01:53.650
running around to keep things from falling over.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.805
But on a long wavelength sea,

00:01:54.805 --> 00:01:57.058
you'd be rolling along, relaxed,

00:01:57.058 --> 00:01:58.312
low energy.

00:01:59.158 --> 00:02:00.704
The energy of light tells us

00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:02.635
how it will interact with matter,

00:02:02.635 --> 00:02:04.918
for example, the cells of our eyes.

00:02:04.918 --> 00:02:07.630
When we see, it's because the energy of light

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.590
stimulates a receptor in our eye

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.324
called the retina.

00:02:11.324 --> 00:02:13.117
Our retina are only sensitive to light

00:02:13.117 --> 00:02:15.319
with a very small range in energy,

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.484
and so we call that range of light visible light.

00:02:18.484 --> 00:02:20.700
Inside our retina are special receptors

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.734
called rods and cones.

00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:24.570
The rods measure brightness,

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.538
so we know how much light there is.

00:02:26.538 --> 00:02:29.552
The cones are in charge of what color of light we see

00:02:29.552 --> 00:02:31.221
because different cones are sensitive

00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:33.426
to different energies of light.

00:02:33.426 --> 00:02:35.421
Some cones are more excited by light

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:37.820
that is long wavelength and low energy,

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.654
and other cones are more excited

00:02:39.654 --> 00:02:42.537
by short wavelength, high-energy light.

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:43.767
When light hits our eye,

00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:46.183
the relative amount of energy each cone measures

00:02:46.183 --> 00:02:48.981
signals our brain to perceive colors.

00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:50.235
The rainbow we perceive

00:02:50.235 --> 00:02:53.621
is actually visible light in order of its energy.

00:02:53.621 --> 00:02:54.693
At one side of the rainbow

00:02:54.693 --> 00:02:57.397
is low-energy light we see as red,

00:02:57.397 --> 00:02:59.734
and at the other side is high-energy light

00:02:59.734 --> 00:03:01.631
we see as blue.

00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:02.813
If light shines on us

00:03:02.813 --> 00:03:04.896
that has an energy our retina can't measure,

00:03:04.896 --> 00:03:06.784
we won't be able to see it.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.957
Light that is too short wavelength or high energy

00:03:09.957 --> 00:03:11.981
gets absorbed by the eye's surface

00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:14.130
before it can even get to the retina,

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.940
and light that is too long wavelength

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.206
doesn't have enough energy

00:03:17.206 --> 00:03:19.576
to stimulate our retina at all.

00:03:19.576 --> 00:03:21.520
The only thing that makes one kind of light

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.270
different from another is its wavelength.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.215
Radio waves have long wavelengths,

00:03:26.215 --> 00:03:28.514
while x-rays have short wavelengths.

00:03:28.514 --> 00:03:30.975
And visible light, the kind you can actually see,

00:03:30.975 --> 00:03:33.149
is somewhere in between.

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:35.210
Even though our eyes can't detect light

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.029
outside of the visible range,

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:38.662
we can build special detectors

00:03:38.662 --> 00:03:39.618
that are stimulated

00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:41.622
by these other wavelengths of light,

00:03:41.622 --> 00:03:43.464
kind of like digital eyes.

00:03:43.464 --> 00:03:44.639
With these devices,

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.455
we can measure the light that is there,

00:03:46.455 --> 00:03:48.804
even though we can't see it ourselves.

00:03:50.264 --> 00:03:51.819
So, take a step back and think about

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.789
all of this for a moment.

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:54.875
Even though they seem different,

00:03:54.875 --> 00:03:57.092
the warmth you feel from a crackling fire

00:03:57.092 --> 00:03:58.972
is the same as the sun shining on you

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:00.234
on a beautiful day,

00:04:00.234 --> 00:04:01.927
the same as ultraviolet light

00:04:01.927 --> 00:04:04.418
you put on sunscreen to protect yourself from,

00:04:04.418 --> 00:04:05.997
the same thing as your TV,

00:04:05.997 --> 00:04:06.897
your radio,

00:04:06.897 --> 00:04:08.280
and your microwave.

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.479
Now, those examples are all things here on Earth,

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:13.759
things you experience in your everyday life,

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:16.594
but here's something even more amazing.

00:04:16.594 --> 00:04:20.121
Our universe gives off the full spectrum of light, too.

00:04:20.782 --> 00:04:22.459
When you think of the night sky,

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:24.057
you probably think of being able

00:04:24.057 --> 00:04:26.677
to see the stars shining with your own eyes,

00:04:26.677 --> 00:04:28.312
but that's just visible light,

00:04:28.312 --> 00:04:30.181
which you now know is only a tiny part

00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:31.956
of the full spectrum.

00:04:31.956 --> 00:04:33.287
If we had to draw the universe

00:04:33.287 --> 00:04:35.600
and could only use visible light,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.428
it would be like having only one crayon --

00:04:37.428 --> 00:04:38.702
pretty sad.

00:04:39.426 --> 00:04:41.504
To see the universe in its full spectrum,

00:04:41.504 --> 00:04:43.329
we need to have the right eyes,

00:04:43.329 --> 00:04:45.283
and that means using special telescopes

00:04:45.283 --> 00:04:48.158
that can help us see beyond visible light.

00:04:48.158 --> 00:04:50.498
You've probably heard of the Hubble Space Telescope

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:51.783
and seen its beautiful pictures

00:04:51.783 --> 00:04:54.516
taken in visible and ultraviolet light.

00:04:54.516 --> 00:04:55.749
But you might not know

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:58.355
that there are 20 space telescopes in orbit,

00:04:58.355 --> 00:05:00.144
missions that can each see part

00:05:00.144 --> 00:05:01.780
of the full spectrum of light.

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:04.862
With telescopes acting as our virtual eyes,

00:05:04.862 --> 00:05:06.610
both in space and here on Earth,

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.260
we can see some amazing things.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.787
And the coolest thing of all,

00:05:10.787 --> 00:05:13.201
no matter the wavelength or energy,

00:05:13.201 --> 00:05:15.697
the light that we see out in the distant universe

00:05:15.697 --> 00:05:17.120
is the same thing as the light

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.717
that we can experience and study here on Earth.

00:05:19.717 --> 00:05:20.992
So, since we know the physics

00:05:20.992 --> 00:05:22.280
of how x-ray,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.410
ultraviolet light,

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.204
or microwaves work here,

00:05:25.204 --> 00:05:28.202
we can study the light of a distant star or galaxy

00:05:28.202 --> 00:05:29.698
and know what kinds of things

00:05:29.698 --> 00:05:31.503
are happening there too.

00:05:31.503 --> 00:05:33.254
So, as you go about your daily life,

00:05:33.254 --> 00:05:35.954
think beyond what your eyes can and can't see.

00:05:35.954 --> 00:05:38.371
Knowing just a little bit about the natural world

00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:40.347
can help you perceive the full spectrum

00:05:40.347 --> 00:05:42.253
around you all the time.
