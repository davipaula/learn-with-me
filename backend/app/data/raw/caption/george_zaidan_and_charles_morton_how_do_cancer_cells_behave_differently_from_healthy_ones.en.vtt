00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:17.305
We all start life as one single cell.

00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:19.956
Then that cell divides and we are two cells,

00:00:19.956 --> 00:00:20.780
then four,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.855
then eight.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:22.957
Cells form tissues,

00:00:22.957 --> 00:00:24.133
tissues form organs,

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.058
organs form us.

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:29.007
These cell divisions, by which we go from a single cell

00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:30.874
to 100 trillion cells,

00:00:30.874 --> 00:00:32.975
are called growth.

00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:34.629
And growth seems like a simple thing

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:35.969
because when we think of it,

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.229
we typically think of someone getting taller

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:40.377
or, later in life, wider,

00:00:40.377 --> 00:00:42.875
but to cells, growth isn't simple.

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:45.324
Cell division is an intricate chemical dance

00:00:45.324 --> 00:00:47.955
that's part individual, part community-driven.

00:00:47.955 --> 00:00:50.480
And in a neighborhood of 100 trillion cells,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.004
some times things go wrong.

00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:56.708
Maybe an individual cell's set of instructions, or DNA,

00:00:56.708 --> 00:00:57.847
gets a typo,

00:00:57.847 --> 00:00:59.704
what we call a mutation.

00:00:59.704 --> 00:01:01.562
Most of the time, the cell senses mistakes

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:03.396
and shuts itself down,

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:04.962
or the system detects a troublemaker

00:01:04.962 --> 00:01:05.969
and eliminates it.

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:08.813
But, enough mutations can bypass the fail-safes,

00:01:08.813 --> 00:01:10.967
driving the cell to divide recklessly.

00:01:10.967 --> 00:01:13.133
That one rogue cell becomes two,

00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:14.125
then four,

00:01:14.125 --> 00:01:15.379
then eight.

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:17.114
At every stage, the incorrect instructions

00:01:17.114 --> 00:01:19.590
are passed along to the cells' offspring.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.456
Weeks, months, or years

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:24.100
after that one rogue cell transformed,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.600
you might see your doctor about a lump in your breast.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.356
Difficulty going to the bathroom could reveal

00:01:28.356 --> 00:01:30.357
a problem in your intestine,

00:01:30.357 --> 00:01:30.729
prostate,

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:31.528
or bladder.

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:34.845
Or, a routine blood test might count too many white cells

00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:37.030
or elevated liver enzymes.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.038
Your doctor delivers the bad news:

00:01:39.038 --> 00:01:40.161
it's cancer.

00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:41.459
From here your strategy will depend

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:43.366
on where the cancer is and

00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:45.048
how far it's progressed.

00:01:45.048 --> 00:01:47.696
If the tumor is slow-growing and in one place,

00:01:47.696 --> 00:01:50.097
surgery might be all you need, if anything.

00:01:50.097 --> 00:01:53.041
If the tumor is fast-growing or invading nearby tissue,

00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:55.170
your doctor might recommend radiation

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.956
or surgery followed by radiation.

00:01:57.956 --> 00:01:59.164
If the cancer has spread,

00:01:59.164 --> 00:02:01.757
or if it's inherently everywhere like a leukemia,

00:02:01.757 --> 00:02:04.873
your doctor will most likely recommend chemotherapy

00:02:04.873 --> 00:02:07.258
or a combination of radiation and chemo.

00:02:07.258 --> 00:02:09.199
Radiation and most forms of chemo work

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.527
by physically shredding the cells' DNA

00:02:11.527 --> 00:02:14.532
or disrupting the copying machinery.

00:02:14.532 --> 00:02:19.094
But neither radiation nor chemotherapeutic drugs target only cancer cells.

00:02:19.094 --> 00:02:21.563
Radiation hits whatever you point it at,

00:02:21.563 --> 00:02:23.585
and your blood stream carries chemo-therapeutics

00:02:23.585 --> 00:02:25.574
all over your body.

00:02:25.574 --> 00:02:28.516
So, what happens when different cells get hit?

00:02:28.516 --> 00:02:29.995
Let's look at a healthy liver cell,

00:02:29.995 --> 00:02:31.248
a healthy hair cell,

00:02:31.248 --> 00:02:33.001
and a cancerous cell.

00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:35.846
The healthy liver cell divides only when it is stressed;

00:02:35.846 --> 00:02:37.949
the healthy hair cell divides frequently;

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:41.877
and the cancer cell divides even more frequently and recklessly.

00:02:41.877 --> 00:02:43.629
When you take a chemotherapeutic drug,

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.081
it will hit all of these cells.

00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:49.479
And remember that the drugs work typically by disrupting cell division.

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:51.194
So, every time a cell divides,

00:02:51.194 --> 00:02:53.729
it opens itself up to attack,

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:55.550
and that means the more frequently a cell divides,

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.045
the more likely the drug is to kill it.

00:02:58.045 --> 00:02:59.694
So, remember that hair cell?

00:02:59.694 --> 00:03:02.920
It divides frequently and isn't a threat.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.302
And, there are other frequently dividing cells in your body

00:03:05.302 --> 00:03:08.466
like skin cells, gut cells, and blood cells.

00:03:08.466 --> 00:03:11.097
So the list of unpleasant side effects of cancer treatment

00:03:11.097 --> 00:03:13.128
parallels these tissue types:

00:03:13.128 --> 00:03:13.703
hair loss,

00:03:13.703 --> 00:03:14.731
skin rashes,

00:03:14.731 --> 00:03:15.294
nausea,

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:15.882
vomiting,

00:03:15.882 --> 00:03:16.465
fatigue,

00:03:16.465 --> 00:03:17.296
weight loss,

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:18.683
and pain.

00:03:18.683 --> 00:03:22.333
That makes sense because these are the cells that get hit the hardest.

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:24.878
So, in the end, it is all about growth.

00:03:24.878 --> 00:03:27.269
Cancer hijacks cells' natural division machinery

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.818
and forces them to put the pedal to the metal,

00:03:29.818 --> 00:03:31.952
growing rapidly and recklessly.

00:03:31.952 --> 00:03:33.702
But, using chemotherapeutic drugs,

00:03:33.702 --> 00:03:36.126
we take advantage of that aggressiveness,

00:03:36.126 --> 00:03:37.703
and we turn cancer's main strength

00:03:37.703 --> 00:03:40.191
into a weakness.
