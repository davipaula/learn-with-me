00:00:07.814 --> 00:00:12.887
Imagine a distant future when humans
reach beyond our pale blue dot,

00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:17.019
forge cities on planets 
thousands of light-years away,

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:21.516
and maintain a galactic web 
of trade and transport.

00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:25.406
What would it take for our civilization
to make that leap?

00:00:25.406 --> 00:00:28.356
There are many things to consider—
how would we communicate?

00:00:28.356 --> 00:00:30.996
What might a galactic government
look like?

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:33.726
And one of the most fundamental 
of all:

00:00:33.726 --> 00:00:37.616
where would we get enough energy
to power that civilization—

00:00:37.616 --> 00:00:43.582
its industry, its terraforming operations,
and its starships?

00:00:43.582 --> 00:00:47.582
An astronomer named Nikolai Kardashev
proposed a scale

00:00:47.582 --> 00:00:52.452
to quantify an evolving civilization’s 
increasing energy needs.

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:56.452
In the first evolutionary stage, 
which we’re currently in,

00:00:56.452 --> 00:00:59.832
planet-based fuel sources 
like fossil fuels,

00:00:59.832 --> 00:01:02.352
solar panels and nuclear power plants

00:01:02.352 --> 00:01:07.136
are probably enough to settle other 
planets inside our own solar system,

00:01:07.136 --> 00:01:09.956
but not much beyond that.

00:01:09.956 --> 00:01:13.165
For a civilization on the third 
and final stage,

00:01:13.165 --> 00:01:18.222
expansion on a galactic scale 
would require about 100 billion times

00:01:18.222 --> 00:01:25.993
more energy than the full 385 yotta joules
our sun releases every second.

00:01:25.993 --> 00:01:28.863
Barring a breakthrough in exotic physics,

00:01:28.863 --> 00:01:32.307
there’s only one energy source 
that could suffice:

00:01:32.307 --> 00:01:35.447
a supermassive black hole.

00:01:35.447 --> 00:01:39.447
It’s counterintuitive to think 
of black holes as energy sources,

00:01:39.447 --> 00:01:44.033
but that’s exactly what they are, 
thanks to their accretion disks:

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:49.905
circular, flat structures formed 
by matter falling into the event horizon.

00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:52.985
Because of conservation 
of angular momentum,

00:01:52.985 --> 00:01:56.985
particles there don’t just plummet 
straight into the black hole.

00:01:56.985 --> 00:02:00.215
Instead, they slowly spiral.

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:03.565
Due to the intense gravitational field 
of the black hole,

00:02:03.565 --> 00:02:07.175
these particles convert their potential
energy to kinetic energy

00:02:07.175 --> 00:02:10.005
as they inch closer to the event horizon.

00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:12.935
Particle interactions allow
for this kinetic energy

00:02:12.935 --> 00:02:15.455
to be radiated out into space

00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:18.934
at an astonishing matter-to-energy 
efficiency:

00:02:18.934 --> 00:02:25.963
6% for non-rotating black holes, 
and up to 32% for rotating ones.

00:02:25.963 --> 00:02:29.523
This drastically outshines
nuclear fission,

00:02:29.523 --> 00:02:32.803
currently the most efficient 
widely available mechanism

00:02:32.803 --> 00:02:35.333
to extract energy from mass.

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:42.432
Fission converts just 0.08% 
of a Uranium atom into energy.

00:02:42.432 --> 00:02:46.123
The key to harnessing this power 
may lie in a structure

00:02:46.123 --> 00:02:52.152
devised by physicist Freeman Dyson,
known as the Dyson sphere.

00:02:52.152 --> 00:02:56.803
In the 1960s, Dyson proposed 
that an advanced planetary civilization

00:02:56.803 --> 00:03:01.020
could engineer an artificial sphere 
around their main star,

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.109
capturing all of its radiated energy 
to satisfy their needs.

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.319
A similar, though vastly 
more complicated design

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.799
could theoretically be applied 
to black holes.

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.334
In order to produce energy, 
black holes need to be continuously fed—

00:03:17.334 --> 00:03:20.584
so we wouldn’t want to fully cover 
it with a sphere.

00:03:20.584 --> 00:03:23.724
Even if we did, the plasma jets 
that shoot from the poles

00:03:23.724 --> 00:03:26.134
of many supermassive black holes

00:03:26.134 --> 00:03:30.134
would blow any structure 
in their way to smithereens.

00:03:30.134 --> 00:03:33.784
So instead, we might design 
a sort of Dyson ring,

00:03:33.784 --> 00:03:37.074
made of massive, 
remotely controlled collectors.

00:03:37.074 --> 00:03:40.024
They’d swarm in an orbit 
around a black hole,

00:03:40.024 --> 00:03:44.024
perhaps on the plane 
of its accretion disk, but farther out.

00:03:44.024 --> 00:03:46.714
These devices could use 
mirror-like panels

00:03:46.714 --> 00:03:50.054
to transmit the collected energy
to a powerplant,

00:03:50.054 --> 00:03:52.750
or a battery for storage.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.704
We’d need to ensure that these collectors
are built at just the right radius:

00:03:57.704 --> 00:04:00.734
too close and they’d melt 
from the radiated energy.

00:04:00.734 --> 00:04:05.537
Too far, and they’d only collect 
a tiny fraction of the available energy

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:09.187
and might be disrupted by stars orbiting
the black hole.

00:04:09.187 --> 00:04:14.071
We would likely need several Earths
worth of highly reflective material

00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:17.181
like hematite to construct
the full system—

00:04:17.181 --> 00:04:23.053
plus a few more dismantled planets
to make a legion of construction robots.

00:04:23.053 --> 00:04:27.243
Once built, the Dyson ring 
would be a technological masterpiece,

00:04:27.243 --> 00:04:32.495
powering a civilization spread
across every arm of a galaxy.

00:04:32.495 --> 00:04:35.085
This all may seem like wild speculation.

00:04:35.085 --> 00:04:38.255
But even now, 
in our current energy crisis,

00:04:38.255 --> 00:04:41.795
we’re confronted 
by the limited resources of our planet.

00:04:41.795 --> 00:04:45.795
New ways of sustainable energy
production will always be needed,

00:04:45.795 --> 00:04:48.825
especially as humanity works 
towards the survival

00:04:48.825 --> 00:04:52.035
and technological progress of our species.

00:04:52.035 --> 00:04:54.855
Perhaps there’s already a civilization
out there

00:04:54.855 --> 00:04:58.055
that has conquered 
these astronomical giants.

00:04:58.055 --> 00:04:59.935
We may even be able to tell

00:04:59.935 --> 00:05:03.925
by seeing the light 
from their black hole periodically dim

00:05:03.925 --> 00:05:08.175
as pieces of the Dyson ring pass 
between us and them.

00:05:08.175 --> 00:05:13.081
Or maybe these superstructures are fated 
to remain in the realm of theory.

00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:17.345
Only time— and our scientific ingenuity— 
will tell.
