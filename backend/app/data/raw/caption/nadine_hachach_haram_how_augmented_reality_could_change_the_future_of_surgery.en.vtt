00:00:12.857 --> 00:00:15.695
According to the theories
of human social development,

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.936
we're now living
through the fourth great epoch

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.055
of technological advancement,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.280
the Information Age.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.816
Connectivity through digital technology
is a modern miracle.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.976
We can say it has broken down barriers
of time and space which separate people,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.896
and it's created a condition for an age

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.160
where information, ideas
can be shared freely.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.176
But are these great accomplishments
in digital technology

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.680
really the endgame
in terms of what can be achieved?

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.056
I don't think so,

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.856
and today I'd like to share with you

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.160
how I believe digital technology
can take us to even greater heights.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.816
I'm a surgeon by profession,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.216
and as I stand here today
talking to all of you,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.616
five billion people around the world
lack access to safe surgical care.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.056
Five billion people.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.696
That's 70 percent
of the world's population,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.176
who according to the WHO's
Lancet Commission

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.976
can't even access
simple surgical procedures

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.320
as and when they need them.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.816
Let's zoom in on Sierra Leone,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.336
a country of six million people,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.840
where a recent study showed
that there are only 10 qualified surgeons.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.520
That's one surgeon
for every 600,000 people.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.800
The numbers are staggering,

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.600
and we don't even need to look that far.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.296
If we look around us here in the US,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.056
a recent study reported that we need
an extra 100,000 surgeons by 2030

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.480
to just keep up with the demand
for routine surgical procedures.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.240
At the rate that we're going,
we won't be meeting those numbers.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.136
As a surgeon, this is
a global issue that bothers me.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.696
It bothers me a lot,

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.536
because I've seen firsthand

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.416
how lack of access
to safe and affordable healthcare

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.360
can blight the lives of ordinary people.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.056
If you're a patient
that needs an operation

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.816
and there isn't a surgeon available,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.040
you're left with some
really difficult choices:

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.240
to wait, to travel,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.920
or not to have an operation at all.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.120
So what's the answer?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.096
Well, part of you are carrying
some of that solution with you today:

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.960
a smartphone, a tablet, a computer.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.456
Because for me,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.536
digital communications technology
has the power to do so much more

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.816
than just to allow us to shop online,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.888
to connect through social media platforms
and to stay up to date.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.096
It has the power to help us solve
some of the key issues that we face,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.640
like lack of access
to vital surgical services.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.176
And today I'd like to share with you

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.640
an example of how I think
we can make that possible.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.776
The history of surgery
is filled with breakthroughs

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.136
in how science and technology
was able to help the surgeons of the day

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.656
face their greatest challenges.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.656
If we go back several hundred years,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.576
an understanding of microbiology

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.936
led to the development
of antiseptic techniques,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.816
which played a big role in making sure

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.176
patients were able
to stay alive postsurgery.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.776
Fast-forward a few hundred years

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.136
and we developed
keyhole or arthroscopic surgery,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.056
which combines video technology
and precision instruments

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.760
to make surgery less invasive.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.096
And more recently, a lot of you
will be aware of robotic surgery,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.776
and what robotics brings to surgery
is much like modern automated machinery,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.000
ultraprecision,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.096
the ability to carry out procedures
at the tiniest scales

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.040
with a degree of accuracy
that even surpasses the human hand.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.640
But robotic surgery also introduced
something else to surgery:

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.936
the idea that a surgeon

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.640
doesn't actually have to be standing
at the patient's bedside to deliver care,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.216
that he could be looking at a screen

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.400
and instructing a robot
through a computer.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.880
We call this remote surgery.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.496
It is incumbent on us

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.976
to find solutions that solve these answers
in a cost-effective and scalable way,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.656
so that everyone, no matter
where they are in the world,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.320
can have these problems addressed.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.096
So what if I told you

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.496
that you didn't really need
a million-dollar robot

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.760
to provide remote surgery?

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.680
That all you needed
was a phone, a tablet, or a computer,

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.000
an internet connection,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.616
a confident colleague on the ground

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.200
and one magic ingredient:

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.880
an augmented reality
collaboration software.

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:30.815
Using this augmented reality
collaboration software,

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:33.896
an expert surgeon
can now virtually transport himself

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.696
into any clinical setting

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.776
simply by using his phone
or tablet or computer,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.656
and he can visually and practically
interact in an operation

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.016
from start to finish,

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.640
guiding and mentoring a local doctor
through the procedure step by step.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.016
Well, enough of me telling you about it.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.320
I'd now like to show you.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.776
We're now going to go live
to Dr. Marc Tompkins,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.360
an orthopedic surgeon
at the University of Minnesota.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.296
He's going to perform
an arthroscopic surgery for us,

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.496
a keyhole surgery of the knee,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.056
and I'd like to disclose

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.240
that this patient has consented
to having their operation streamed.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.696
I'd also like to point out
that in the interest of time,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.936
we're just going to go
through the first steps,

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.216
marking up the patient

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.000
and just identifying
a few key anatomical landmarks.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.920
Hello, Dr. Tompkins, can you hear me?

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.176
Dr. Mark Tompkins: Good morning, Nadine.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.616
Nadine Hachach-Haram:
Everyone from TED says hello.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.840
Audience: Hi.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.496
NHH: Alright, Dr. Tompkins,
let's get started.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.816
So let's start with our incisions
and where we're going to make these,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.776
on either side of the patellar tendon.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.496
So if you can make
your incisions there and there,

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.640
that should hopefully
get us into the knee.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.400
MT: All right, I'm going in.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.040
NHH: Great.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.640
So we're just getting
inside the joint now.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.800
So why don't we go around
and have a quick look at the meniscus.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.880
MT: Perfect.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.496
NHH: Great, so we can see there's
a small tear there on the meniscus,

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.360
but otherwise it looks alright.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.216
And if you turn
and head to this direction,

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.456
follow my finger,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.680
let's have a quick look
at the ACL and the PCL.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.936
That's your ACL there,
that looks quite healthy,

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.216
no problems there.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.256
So we've just identified
that small meniscus tear there,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.000
but otherwise the fluid
around the joint looks OK as well.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.256
All right, thank you very much,
Dr. Tompkins. Thank you for your time.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.896
I'll let you continue.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.256
Have a good day. Bye.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.360
(Applause)

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.896
So I hope through
this simple demonstration

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.816
I was able to illustrate to you
just how powerful this technology can be.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.056
And I'd like to point out
that I wasn't using any special equipment,

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.536
just my laptop and a really simple webcam.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.536
We're so used to using digital technology

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.800
to communicate through voice
and text and video,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.056
but augmented reality
can do something so much deeper.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.376
It allows two people to virtually interact

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.115
in a way that mimics
how they would collaborate in person.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.416
Being able to show someone
what you want to do,

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.576
to illustrate and demonstrate and gesture,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.840
is so much more powerful
than just telling them.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.056
And it can make
for such a great learning tool,

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.440
because we learn better
through direct experience.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.496
So how is this making
a difference around the world?

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.576
Well, back in my teaching hospital,

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.696
we've been using this to support
local district general hospitals

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.320
and providing skin cancer surgery
and trauma treatment.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.176
Now, patients can access
care at a local level.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.536
This reduces their travel time,
improves their access,

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.760
and saves money.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.976
We've even started seeing its use
in wound care management with nurses

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.736
and in outpatient management.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.496
Most recently, and quite exciting,

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.560
it was used in supporting a surgeon
through a cancer removal of a kidney.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.160
And I'd like to just share with you
a very quick video here.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.320
I apologize for some
of the gruesome views.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.320
(Video) Doctor 1: OK. Show me again.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.856
Doctor 2: If you see here,

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.936
that's the upper part,
the most outer part of your tumor.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.216
Doctor 1: Yes.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.096
Doctor 2: So it's
three centimeters deep,

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.000
so this should be three centimeters.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.176
Doctor 1: Yes, yes.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:36.080
Doctor 2: OK,
so you need to get a 3.5 margin.

00:08:37.536 --> 00:08:39.536
Doctor 1: I'm going to show you anyway

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.120
and tell me what you think about it.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.256
NHH: We're also seeing the use
of this technology at a global scale,

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.816
and one of the most
heartwarming stories I can recall

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.080
is from the town of Trujillo
in the north of Lima in Peru,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.696
where this technology
was used to support the provision

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.336
of cleft lip and palate
surgery to children,

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.336
children from poor backgrounds who
didn't have access to health insurance.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.976
And in this town, there was
a hospital with one surgeon

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.936
working hard to provide this care,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.160
Dr. Soraya.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.456
Now, Dr. Soraya was struggling
under the sheer demand

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.896
of her local population,

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.496
as well as the fact that she wasn't
specifically trained in this procedure.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.216
And so, with the help of a charity,

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.696
we were able to connect her
with a cleft surgeon in California,

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.016
and using this technology, he was able
to guide her and her colleagues

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.736
through the procedure step by step,

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.936
guiding them, training them
and teaching them.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.216
Within a few months,

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.696
they were able to perform
30 percent more operations

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.816
with less and less complications.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:38.256
And now Dr. Soraya and her team
can perform these operations

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.160
independently, competently
and confidently.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.776
And I remember one quote
from a mother who said,

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.920
"This technology
gave my daughter her smile."

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.080
For me, this is the real power
of this technology.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.176
The beauty is that it breaks boundaries.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.560
It transcends all
technological difficulties.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.000
It connects people.
It democratizes access.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.416
Wi-Fi and mobile technology
are growing rapidly,

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.456
and they should play a role
in boosting surgical provision.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.936
We've even seen it used in conflict zones
where there's considerable risk

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.496
in getting specialist surgeons
to certain locations.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.416
In a world where
there are more mobile devices

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.296
than there are human beings,

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.200
it truly has a global reach.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.736
Of course, we've still got a long way

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.256
before we can solve the problem
of getting surgery to five billion people,

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.536
and unfortunately,

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.800
some people still
don't have access to internet.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.080
But things are rapidly moving
in the right direction.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.080
The potential for change is there.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.776
My team and I are growing
our global footprint,

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.720
and we're starting to see
the potential of this technology.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.336
Through digital technology,

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.656
through simple, everyday devices
that we take for granted,

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.696
through devices of the future,

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.680
we can really do miraculous things.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.576
Thank you.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.840
(Applause)
