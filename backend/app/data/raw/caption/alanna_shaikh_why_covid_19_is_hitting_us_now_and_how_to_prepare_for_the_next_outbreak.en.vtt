00:00:12.993 --> 00:00:16.596
I want to lead here by talking
a little bit about my credentials

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.230
to bring this up with you,

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:20.471
because, quite honestly,

00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:24.963
you really, really should not listen
to any old person with an opinion

00:00:24.987 --> 00:00:26.578
about COVID-19.

00:00:26.602 --> 00:00:28.231
(Laughter)

00:00:28.255 --> 00:00:32.260
So I've been working in global health
for about 20 years,

00:00:32.284 --> 00:00:36.798
and my specific technical specialty
is in health systems

00:00:36.822 --> 00:00:40.700
and what happens when health systems
experience severe shocks.

00:00:40.724 --> 00:00:43.193
I've also worked
in global health journalism;

00:00:43.217 --> 00:00:46.928
I've written about
global health and biosecurity

00:00:46.952 --> 00:00:50.064
for newspapers and web outlets,

00:00:50.088 --> 00:00:52.243
and I published a book a few years back

00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:55.693
about the major global health threats
facing us as a planet.

00:00:56.281 --> 00:01:00.047
I have supported and led
epidemiology efforts

00:01:00.071 --> 00:01:03.939
that range from evaluating
Ebola treatment centers

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:08.092
to looking at transmission
of tuberculosis in health facilities

00:01:08.116 --> 00:01:10.872
and doing avian influenza preparedness.

00:01:11.397 --> 00:01:14.486
I have a master's degree
in International Health.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.048
I'm not a physician. I'm not a nurse.

00:01:17.072 --> 00:01:21.345
My specialty isn't patient care
or taking care of individual people.

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.050
My specialty is looking at populations
and health systems,

00:01:25.074 --> 00:01:28.135
what happens when diseases
move on the large level.

00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:32.946
If we're ranking sources
of global health expertise

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.549
on a scale of one to 10,

00:01:35.573 --> 00:01:39.196
one is some random person
ranting on Facebook

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.075
and 10 is the World Health Organization,

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:46.823
I'd say you can probably put me
at like a seven or an eight.

00:01:46.847 --> 00:01:49.386
So keep that in mind as I talk to you.

00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:54.116
I'll start with the basics here,
because I think that's gotten lost

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.557
in some of the media
noise around COVID-19.

00:01:58.281 --> 00:02:02.251
So, COVID-19 is a coronavirus.

00:02:02.275 --> 00:02:06.228
Coronaviruses are
a specific subset of virus,

00:02:06.252 --> 00:02:09.663
and they have some unique
characteristics as viruses.

00:02:09.687 --> 00:02:13.426
They use RNA instead of DNA
as their genetic material,

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.573
and they're covered in spikes
on the surface of the virus.

00:02:16.597 --> 00:02:19.484
They use those spikes to invade cells.

00:02:19.508 --> 00:02:23.010
Those spikes are the corona
in coronavirus.

00:02:24.364 --> 00:02:28.035
COVID-19 is known as a novel coronavirus

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:32.173
because, until December,
we'd only heard of six coronaviruses.

00:02:32.197 --> 00:02:34.113
COVID-19 is the seventh.

00:02:34.137 --> 00:02:35.297
It's new to us.

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.912
It just had its gene sequencing,

00:02:36.936 --> 00:02:38.131
it just got its name.

00:02:38.155 --> 00:02:39.487
That's why it's novel.

00:02:40.215 --> 00:02:44.428
If you remember SARS,
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,

00:02:44.452 --> 00:02:45.623
or MERS,

00:02:45.647 --> 00:02:47.575
Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome,

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.638
those were coronaviruses.

00:02:49.662 --> 00:02:52.779
And they're both called
respiratory syndromes,

00:02:52.803 --> 00:02:55.692
because that's what coronaviruses do --

00:02:55.716 --> 00:02:57.514
they go for your lungs.

00:02:57.538 --> 00:03:00.882
They don't make you puke, they don't
make you bleed from the eyeballs,

00:03:00.906 --> 00:03:02.390
they don't make you hemorrhage.

00:03:02.414 --> 00:03:03.698
They head for your lungs.

00:03:04.595 --> 00:03:06.694
COVID-19 is no different.

00:03:07.193 --> 00:03:10.517
It causes a range of respiratory symptoms

00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:13.714
that go from stuff like
a dry cough and a fever

00:03:13.738 --> 00:03:17.386
all the way out to fatal viral pneumonia.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.699
And that range of symptoms
is one of the reasons

00:03:20.723 --> 00:03:24.070
it's actually been so hard
to track this outbreak.

00:03:24.094 --> 00:03:29.190
Plenty of people get
COVID-19 but so gently,

00:03:29.214 --> 00:03:33.173
their symptoms are so mild, they don't
even go to a health care provider.

00:03:33.197 --> 00:03:35.095
They don't register in the system.

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:38.879
Children, in particular, have it
very easy with COVID-19,

00:03:38.903 --> 00:03:41.300
which is something
we should all be grateful for.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.934
Coronaviruses are zoonotic,

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:49.218
which means that they transmit
from animals to people.

00:03:49.242 --> 00:03:53.872
Some coronaviruses, like COVID-19,
also transmit person to person.

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:57.956
The person-to-person ones
travel faster and travel farther,

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.605
just like COVID-19.

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:03.415
Zoonotic illnesses
are really hard to get rid of,

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:05.690
because they have an animal reservoir.

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:09.251
One example is avian influenza,

00:04:09.275 --> 00:04:14.376
where we can abolish it
in farmed animals, in turkeys, in ducks,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.623
but it keeps coming back every year
because it's brought to us by wild birds.

00:04:18.647 --> 00:04:20.062
You don't hear a lot about it

00:04:20.086 --> 00:04:22.896
because avian influenza
doesn't transmit person-to-person,

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.235
but we have outbreaks in poultry farms
every year all over the world.

00:04:28.506 --> 00:04:32.735
COVID-19 most likely skipped
from animals into people

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.316
at a wild animal market in Wuhan, China.

00:04:36.987 --> 00:04:39.115
Now for the less basic parts.

00:04:40.034 --> 00:04:43.727
This is not the last major outbreak
we're ever going to see.

00:04:44.106 --> 00:04:48.371
There's going to be more outbreaks,
and there's going to be more epidemics.

00:04:48.395 --> 00:04:51.225
That's not a maybe. That's a given.

00:04:51.672 --> 00:04:54.861
And it's a result of the way
that we, as human beings,

00:04:54.885 --> 00:04:56.770
are interacting with our planet.

00:04:57.225 --> 00:05:00.273
Human choices are driving us
into a position

00:05:00.297 --> 00:05:02.920
where we're going to see more outbreaks.

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.301
Part of that is about climate change

00:05:05.325 --> 00:05:08.275
and the way a warming climate
makes the world more hospitable

00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:09.850
to viruses and bacteria.

00:05:10.287 --> 00:05:16.328
But it's also about the way we're pushing
into the last wild spaces on our planet.

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:19.879
When we burn and plow
the Amazon rain forest

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:22.454
so that we can have
cheap land for ranching,

00:05:22.478 --> 00:05:26.475
when the last of the African bush
gets converted to farms,

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:31.301
when wild animals in China
are hunted to extinction,

00:05:31.325 --> 00:05:34.461
human beings come into contact
with wildlife populations

00:05:34.485 --> 00:05:37.278
that they've never come
into contact with before,

00:05:37.302 --> 00:05:40.290
and those populations
have new kinds of diseases:

00:05:40.314 --> 00:05:43.685
bacteria, viruses,
stuff we're not ready for.

00:05:44.612 --> 00:05:46.085
Bats, in particular,

00:05:46.109 --> 00:05:49.378
have a knack for hosting illnesses
that can infect people,

00:05:49.402 --> 00:05:51.589
but they're not
the only animals that do it.

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.250
So as long as we keep making
our remote places less remote,

00:05:57.274 --> 00:05:59.238
the outbreaks are going to keep coming.

00:06:01.093 --> 00:06:05.737
We can't stop the outbreaks
with quarantine or travel restrictions.

00:06:05.761 --> 00:06:07.673
That's everybody's first impulse:

00:06:07.697 --> 00:06:11.567
"Let's stop the people from moving.
Let's stop this outbreak from happening."

00:06:11.591 --> 00:06:17.076
But the fact is, it's really hard
to get a good quarantine in place.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.176
It's really hard
to set up travel restrictions.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.848
Even the countries that have made
serious investments in public health,

00:06:23.872 --> 00:06:25.568
like the US and South Korea,

00:06:25.592 --> 00:06:28.281
can't get that kind of restriction
in place fast enough

00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:30.588
to actually stop an outbreak instantly.

00:06:31.123 --> 00:06:34.643
There's logistical reasons for that,
and there's medical reasons.

00:06:34.667 --> 00:06:37.502
If you look at COVID-19 right now,

00:06:37.526 --> 00:06:41.550
it seems like it could have a period
where you're infected and show no symptoms

00:06:41.574 --> 00:06:43.668
that's as long as 24 days.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.376
So people are walking around
with this virus showing no signs.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.274
They're not going to get quarantined.
Nobody knows they need quarantining.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.181
There's also some real costs to quarantine
and to travel restrictions.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.679
Humans are social animals,

00:07:01.703 --> 00:07:04.507
and they resist when you try
to hold them into place

00:07:04.531 --> 00:07:06.217
and when you try to separate them.

00:07:06.727 --> 00:07:12.695
We saw in the Ebola outbreak that as soon
as you put a quarantine in place,

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:15.126
people start trying to evade it.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.202
Individual patients, if they know
there's a strict quarantine protocol,

00:07:19.226 --> 00:07:21.354
may not go for health care,

00:07:21.378 --> 00:07:24.823
because they're afraid of the medical
system or they can't afford care

00:07:24.847 --> 00:07:28.134
and they don't want to be separated
from their family and friends.

00:07:28.158 --> 00:07:30.074
Politicians, government officials,

00:07:30.098 --> 00:07:32.561
when they know that they're
going to get quarantined

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:34.448
if they talk about outbreaks and cases,

00:07:34.472 --> 00:07:38.903
may conceal real information for fear
of triggering a quarantine protocol.

00:07:39.522 --> 00:07:43.271
And, of course, these kinds
of evasions and dishonesty

00:07:43.295 --> 00:07:46.956
are exactly what makes it so difficult
to track a disease outbreak.

00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:53.236
We can get better at quarantines
and travel restrictions, and we should,

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.356
but they're not our only option,
and they're not our best option

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.241
for dealing with these situations.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:03.792
The real way for the long haul
to make outbreaks less serious

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:06.589
is to build the global health system

00:08:06.613 --> 00:08:11.816
to support core health care functions
in every country in the world

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.284
so that all countries, even poor ones,

00:08:14.308 --> 00:08:19.272
are able to rapidly identify and treat
new infectious diseases as they emerge.

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:25.064
China's taken a lot of criticism
for its response to COVID-19.

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:29.481
But the fact is, what if COVID-19
had emerged in Chad,

00:08:29.505 --> 00:08:33.041
which has three and a half doctors
for every hundred thousand people?

00:08:33.999 --> 00:08:37.000
What if it had emerged
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,

00:08:37.024 --> 00:08:41.169
which just released its last
Ebola patient from treatment?

00:08:41.193 --> 00:08:44.170
The truth is, countries like this
don't have the resources

00:08:44.194 --> 00:08:46.356
to respond to an infectious disease --

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.085
not to treat people
and not to report on it fast enough

00:08:49.109 --> 00:08:50.773
to help the rest of the world.

00:08:52.878 --> 00:08:57.795
I led an evaluation of Ebola
treatment centers in Sierra Leone,

00:08:57.819 --> 00:09:00.922
and the fact is that
local doctors in Sierra Leone

00:09:00.946 --> 00:09:03.917
identified the Ebola crisis very quickly,

00:09:03.941 --> 00:09:06.897
first as a dangerous,
contagious hemorrhagic virus

00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:09.399
and then as Ebola itself.

00:09:09.423 --> 00:09:13.555
But, having identified it,
they didn't have the resources to respond.

00:09:13.579 --> 00:09:16.949
They didn't have enough doctors,
they didn't have enough hospital beds

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:20.024
and they didn't have enough information
about how to treat Ebola

00:09:20.048 --> 00:09:21.923
or how to implement infection control.

00:09:23.075 --> 00:09:27.802
Eleven doctors died
in Sierra Leone of Ebola.

00:09:27.826 --> 00:09:31.185
The country only had 120
when the crisis started.

00:09:31.885 --> 00:09:33.353
By way of contrast,

00:09:33.377 --> 00:09:37.446
Dallas Baylor Medical Center has
more than a thousand physicians on staff.

00:09:38.615 --> 00:09:41.073
These are the kinds
of inequities that kill people.

00:09:41.451 --> 00:09:44.196
First, they kill the poor people
when the outbreaks start,

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.668
and then they kill people
all over the world

00:09:46.692 --> 00:09:48.238
when the outbreaks spread.

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:51.238
If we really want to slow down
these outbreaks

00:09:51.262 --> 00:09:52.870
and minimize their impact,

00:09:52.894 --> 00:09:55.985
we need to make sure
that every country in the world

00:09:56.009 --> 00:09:58.873
has the capacity to identify new diseases,

00:09:58.897 --> 00:10:00.155
treat them

00:10:00.179 --> 00:10:02.860
and report about them so
they can share information.

00:10:04.445 --> 00:10:07.936
COVID-19 is going to be
a huge burden on health systems.

00:10:08.517 --> 00:10:11.990
COVID-19 has also revealed
some real weaknesses

00:10:12.014 --> 00:10:13.811
in our global health supply chains.

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:19.133
Just-in-time-ordering, lean systems
are great when things are going well,

00:10:19.157 --> 00:10:23.193
but in a time of crisis, what it means is
we don't have any reserves.

00:10:23.217 --> 00:10:25.579
If a hospital -- or a country --

00:10:25.603 --> 00:10:29.494
runs out of face masks
or personal protective equipment,

00:10:29.518 --> 00:10:33.258
there's no big warehouse full of boxes
that we can go to to get more.

00:10:33.282 --> 00:10:35.236
You have to order more from the supplier,

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:39.171
you have to wait for them to produce it
and you have to wait for them to ship it,

00:10:39.195 --> 00:10:40.357
generally from China.

00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:44.615
That's a time lag at a time
when it's most important to move quickly.

00:10:45.391 --> 00:10:49.410
If we'd been perfectly
prepared for COVID-19,

00:10:49.434 --> 00:10:52.961
China would have identified
the outbreak faster.

00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:56.539
They would have been ready
to provide care to infected people

00:10:56.563 --> 00:10:59.103
without having to build new buildings.

00:10:59.127 --> 00:11:02.364
They would have shared
honest information with citizens

00:11:02.388 --> 00:11:04.797
so that we didn't see these
crazy rumors spreading

00:11:04.821 --> 00:11:06.798
on social media in China.

00:11:06.822 --> 00:11:10.172
And they would have shared information
with global health authorities

00:11:10.196 --> 00:11:13.097
so that they could start reporting
to national health systems

00:11:13.121 --> 00:11:15.238
and getting ready
for when the virus spread.

00:11:15.959 --> 00:11:19.055
National health systems would then
have been able to stockpile

00:11:19.079 --> 00:11:20.856
the protective equipment they needed

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.669
and train health care providers
on treatment and infection control.

00:11:25.192 --> 00:11:29.326
We'd have science-based protocols
for what to do when things happen,

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.377
like cruise ships have infected patients.

00:11:31.983 --> 00:11:36.286
And we'd have real information
going out to people everywhere,

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.351
so we wouldn't see embarrassing,
shameful incidents of xenophobia,

00:11:40.375 --> 00:11:44.694
like Asian-looking people getting attacked
on the street in Philadelphia.

00:11:45.403 --> 00:11:47.187
But even with all of that in place,

00:11:47.211 --> 00:11:49.673
we would still have outbreaks.

00:11:50.939 --> 00:11:53.667
The choices we're making about
how we occupy this planet

00:11:53.691 --> 00:11:54.996
make that inevitable.

00:11:56.003 --> 00:12:00.308
As far as we have an expert consensus
on COVID-19, it's this:

00:12:01.006 --> 00:12:03.292
here in the US, and globally,

00:12:03.316 --> 00:12:05.749
it's going to get worse
before it gets better.

00:12:06.489 --> 00:12:10.931
We're seeing cases of human transmission
that aren't from returning travel,

00:12:10.955 --> 00:12:13.053
that are just happening in the community,

00:12:13.077 --> 00:12:15.296
and we're seeing people
infected with COVID-19

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.508
when we don't even know
where the infection came from.

00:12:18.532 --> 00:12:21.255
Those are signs of an outbreak
that's getting worse,

00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:23.519
not an outbreak that's under control.

00:12:26.298 --> 00:12:29.365
It's depressing, but it's not surprising.

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.362
Global health experts,

00:12:31.386 --> 00:12:34.331
when they talk about
the scenario of new viruses,

00:12:34.355 --> 00:12:36.953
this is one of the scenarios
that they look at.

00:12:36.977 --> 00:12:39.549
We all hoped we'd get off easy,

00:12:39.573 --> 00:12:42.958
but when experts
talk about viral planning,

00:12:42.982 --> 00:12:46.850
this is the kind of situation and the way
they expect the virus to move.

00:12:48.727 --> 00:12:51.508
I want to close here
with some personal advice.

00:12:52.524 --> 00:12:53.836
Wash your hands.

00:12:54.442 --> 00:12:56.838
Wash your hands a lot.

00:12:56.862 --> 00:13:00.215
I know you already wash your hands a lot
because you're not disgusting,

00:13:00.239 --> 00:13:02.445
but wash your hands even more.

00:13:02.469 --> 00:13:06.422
Set up cues and routines in your life
to get you to wash your hands.

00:13:06.446 --> 00:13:09.414
Wash your hands every time
you enter and leave a building.

00:13:09.438 --> 00:13:13.142
Wash your hands when you go into a meeting
and when you come out of a meeting.

00:13:13.166 --> 00:13:15.454
Get rituals that are based
around handwashing.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.014
Sanitize your phone.

00:13:18.038 --> 00:13:21.819
You touch that phone with your dirty,
unwashed hands all the time.

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:24.271
I know you take it
into the bathroom with you.

00:13:24.295 --> 00:13:26.446
(Laughter)

00:13:27.264 --> 00:13:32.314
So sanitize your phone and consider
not using it as often in public.

00:13:32.338 --> 00:13:35.459
Maybe TikTok and Instagram
can be home things only.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:37.857
Don't touch your face.

00:13:38.888 --> 00:13:40.538
Don't rub your eyes.

00:13:40.562 --> 00:13:42.014
Don't bite your fingernails.

00:13:42.038 --> 00:13:44.210
Don't wipe your nose
on the back of your hand.

00:13:44.234 --> 00:13:46.311
I mean, don't do that anyway
because, gross.

00:13:46.335 --> 00:13:48.090
(Laughter)

00:13:48.114 --> 00:13:49.669
Don't wear a face mask.

00:13:50.158 --> 00:13:53.473
Face masks are for sick people
and health care providers.

00:13:53.497 --> 00:13:57.409
If you're sick, your face mask
holds in all your coughing and sneezing

00:13:57.433 --> 00:13:59.590
and protects the people around you.

00:13:59.614 --> 00:14:01.433
And if you're a health care provider,

00:14:01.457 --> 00:14:04.068
your face mask is one tool
in a set of tools

00:14:04.092 --> 00:14:05.925
called personal protective equipment

00:14:05.949 --> 00:14:08.810
that you're trained to use
so that you can give patient care

00:14:08.834 --> 00:14:10.438
and not get sick yourself.

00:14:10.462 --> 00:14:13.472
If you're a regular healthy person
wearing a face mask,

00:14:13.496 --> 00:14:15.727
it's just making your face sweaty.

00:14:15.751 --> 00:14:16.893
(Laughter)

00:14:16.917 --> 00:14:19.314
Leave the face masks in stores

00:14:19.338 --> 00:14:22.077
for the doctors and the nurses
and the sick people.

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:25.686
If you think you have
symptoms of COVID-19,

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:28.202
stay home, call your doctor for advice.

00:14:29.143 --> 00:14:34.571
If you're diagnosed with COVID-19,
remember it's generally very mild.

00:14:34.595 --> 00:14:36.056
And if you're a smoker,

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.948
right now is the best
possible time to quit smoking.

00:14:39.679 --> 00:14:41.028
I mean, if you're a smoker,

00:14:41.052 --> 00:14:44.469
right now is always the best
possible time to quit smoking,

00:14:44.493 --> 00:14:47.359
but if you're a smoker
and you're worried about COVID-19,

00:14:47.383 --> 00:14:51.133
I guarantee that quitting
is absolutely the best thing you can do

00:14:51.157 --> 00:14:54.853
to protect yourself
from the worst impacts of COVID-19.

00:14:56.846 --> 00:14:59.345
COVID-19 is scary stuff,

00:14:59.369 --> 00:15:03.548
at a time when pretty much all of our news
feels like scary stuff.

00:15:04.099 --> 00:15:09.093
And there's a lot of bad but appealing
options for dealing with it:

00:15:09.117 --> 00:15:14.405
panic, xenophobia,
agoraphobia, authoritarianism,

00:15:14.429 --> 00:15:19.243
oversimplified lies that make us think
that hate and fury and loneliness

00:15:19.267 --> 00:15:21.420
are the solution to outbreaks.

00:15:21.444 --> 00:15:22.658
But they're not.

00:15:22.682 --> 00:15:24.784
They just make us less prepared.

00:15:25.356 --> 00:15:29.566
There's also a boring
but useful set of options

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.302
that we can use in response to outbreaks,

00:15:32.326 --> 00:15:35.724
things like improving health care
here and everywhere;

00:15:35.748 --> 00:15:38.943
investing in health infrastructure
and disease surveillance

00:15:38.967 --> 00:15:41.302
so that we know
when the new diseases come;

00:15:41.326 --> 00:15:44.268
building health systems
all over the world;

00:15:44.292 --> 00:15:48.863
looking at strengthening our supply chains
so they're ready for emergencies;

00:15:48.887 --> 00:15:51.015
and better education,

00:15:51.039 --> 00:15:55.524
so we're capable of talking about disease
outbreaks and the mathematics of risk

00:15:55.548 --> 00:15:57.845
without just blind panic.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:00.917
We need to be guided by equity here,

00:16:00.941 --> 00:16:03.257
because in this situation, like so many,

00:16:03.281 --> 00:16:06.514
equity is actually
in our own self-interest.

00:16:07.727 --> 00:16:10.429
So thank you so much
for listening to me today,

00:16:10.453 --> 00:16:12.350
and can I be the first one to tell you:

00:16:12.374 --> 00:16:14.540
wash your hands
when you leave the theater.

00:16:14.564 --> 00:16:16.873
(Applause)
