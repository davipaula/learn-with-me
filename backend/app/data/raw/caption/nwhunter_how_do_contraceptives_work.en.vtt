00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.909
Here's what has to happen for pregnancy
to occur after sexual intercourse.

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:12.681
Sperm must swim up the vagina,

00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:14.081
through the cervical opening,

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:15.571
upwards through the uterus,

00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:18.211
and into one of the two fallopian tubes.

00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:22.420
If an egg, released during 
that month's ovulation, is in the tube,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.571
one sperm has a chance to fertilize it.

00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:28.489
Contraceptives are designed
to prevent this process,

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:30.671
and they work in three basic ways.

00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:32.771
They block the sperm,

00:00:32.771 --> 00:00:35.630
disable sperm 
before they reach the uterus,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.944
or suppress ovulation.

00:00:38.944 --> 00:00:41.683
Block is the simplest.

00:00:41.683 --> 00:00:45.080
Male and female condoms prevent
sperm from coming into contact

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.171
with the vaginal space.

00:00:47.171 --> 00:00:50.871
That barrier is also why they,
unlike other contraceptive methods,

00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:55.441
are able to prevent transmission
of certain sexually transmitted diseases.

00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:59.534
Meanwhile, the diaphragm, 
cervical cap, and sponge

00:00:59.534 --> 00:01:04.632
work by being placed over the cervix,
barricading the entrance to the uterus.

00:01:04.632 --> 00:01:08.060
These contraceptives are sometimes
called barrier methods

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.881
and can be used with spermicides,

00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:13.072
an example of 
the second category, disable.

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:17.431
A spermicide is a chemical 
that immobilizes and destroys sperm.

00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:21.971
Today's spermicides come as foam,
cream, jelly, suppositories,

00:01:21.971 --> 00:01:26.461
and even a thin piece of translucent film
that dissolves in the vagina.

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:30.972
These products can be inserted directly
into the vagina before intercourse,

00:01:30.972 --> 00:01:34.252
or can be combined with block methods,
like a diaphragm or condom,

00:01:34.252 --> 00:01:36.202
for added proection.

00:01:36.202 --> 00:01:38.282
The third category 
for preventing pregnancy

00:01:38.282 --> 00:01:42.772
works by suppressing the action of an egg
maturing in the ovary.

00:01:42.772 --> 00:01:45.922
If there isn't an egg available 
in the fallopian tube,

00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:48.622
there's nothing for sperm to fertilize.

00:01:48.622 --> 00:01:50.102
Hormonal contraceptives,

00:01:50.102 --> 00:01:53.982
including the pill, the patch, 
the Depo shot, and the vaginal ring

00:01:53.982 --> 00:02:00.073
all release synthetic versions of various
combinations of progesterone and estrogen.

00:02:00.073 --> 00:02:02.613
This hormone cocktail 
suppresses ovulation,

00:02:02.613 --> 00:02:06.233
keeping the immature egg
safely sequestered in the ovary.

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:10.253
Synthetic progesterone also has a block
trick up its sleeve.

00:02:10.253 --> 00:02:14.644
It makes cervical mucus too thick and
sticky for sperm to swim through easily.

00:02:14.644 --> 00:02:18.354
There are other contraceptives that
use multiple approaches at the same time.

00:02:18.354 --> 00:02:22.955
For example, many IUDs,
or intrauterine devices,

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:26.164
contain synthetic hormones 
which suppress ovulation.

00:02:26.164 --> 00:02:28.333
Some also contain copper,

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:32.969
which disable sperm while also making
egg implantation in the uterus difficult.

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.284
Block, disable, or suppress:

00:02:35.284 --> 00:02:37.626
is one strategy better than the other?

00:02:37.626 --> 00:02:40.884
There are differences, but a lot of it
has to do with how convenient

00:02:40.884 --> 00:02:44.214
and easy it is to use 
each contraceptive correctly.

00:02:44.214 --> 00:02:48.064
For example, male condoms would be
about 98% effective

00:02:48.064 --> 00:02:50.055
if everyone used them perfectly.

00:02:50.055 --> 00:02:55.056
That 98% means if 100 couples correctly
used condoms for a year,

00:02:55.056 --> 00:02:57.475
two women would get pregnant.

00:02:57.475 --> 00:03:02.845
But not everyone uses them correctly,
so they're only 82% effective in practice.

00:03:02.845 --> 00:03:07.028
Other methods, like the patch and pill,
are 99% effective

00:03:07.028 --> 00:03:08.575
when they're used perfectly.

00:03:08.575 --> 00:03:11.504
But in practice, that's 91%.

00:03:11.504 --> 00:03:15.572
Spermicide is only 85% effective,
even with perfect usage,

00:03:15.572 --> 00:03:19.096
and just 71% effective with typical usage.

00:03:19.096 --> 00:03:23.576
Another important consideration in the
choice of contraceptives are side effects,

00:03:23.576 --> 00:03:26.756
which almost exclusively affect women
rather than men.

00:03:26.756 --> 00:03:30.526
Hormonal methods in particular
can cause symptoms like headaches,

00:03:30.526 --> 00:03:31.356
nausea,

00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:32.968
and high blood pressure,

00:03:32.968 --> 00:03:35.056
but they vary from woman to woman.

00:03:35.056 --> 00:03:38.606
That's why these methods
require a prescription from a doctor.

00:03:38.606 --> 00:03:41.486
The choice of contraceptive method
is a personal one,

00:03:41.486 --> 00:03:44.725
and what works best for you now
may change later.

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:47.477
Scientists also continue to research
new methods,

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:51.306
such as a male pill that would
prevent sperm production.

00:03:51.306 --> 00:03:53.766
In the meantime, 
there are quite a few options

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:55.116
to block sperm,

00:03:55.116 --> 00:03:56.136
disable them,

00:03:56.136 --> 00:03:59.096
or suppress eggs
and keep them out of reach.
