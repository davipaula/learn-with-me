00:00:18.583 --> 00:00:20.599
I have, like, a thing about sleeping.

00:00:20.623 --> 00:00:21.813
I don't sleep that much,

00:00:21.837 --> 00:00:24.560
and I've come to this thing
about, like, not sleeping much

00:00:24.584 --> 00:00:25.890
as being a great virtue,

00:00:25.914 --> 00:00:27.571
after years of kind of battling it

00:00:27.595 --> 00:00:29.601
as being a terrible
detriment or something.

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:32.566
And now I really like sort of sitting up.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.745
You know, but for years,
I've been sitting up,

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:40.066
and I think my creativity
is greatly motivated

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.741
by this kind of insomnia.

00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:46.040
I lie awake. I think thoughts.
I walk aimlessly sometimes.

00:00:46.064 --> 00:00:47.897
I used to walk more at night.

00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:52.012
I walk during the day, and I follow
people who I think look interesting.

00:00:52.036 --> 00:00:54.058
(Laughter)

00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:58.728
And sometimes -- actually, once
it was on "Page Six" in the "Post"

00:00:58.752 --> 00:01:01.351
that I was cruising this guy,
like, sort of, whatever,

00:01:01.375 --> 00:01:04.852
but I was actually just following
because he had these great shoes on --

00:01:04.876 --> 00:01:05.880
(Laughter)

00:01:05.904 --> 00:01:07.258
so I was following this guy.

00:01:07.282 --> 00:01:08.921
And I took a picture of his shoes,

00:01:08.945 --> 00:01:11.343
and we thanked each other
and just went on our way.

00:01:11.367 --> 00:01:12.659
But I do that all the time.

00:01:12.683 --> 00:01:15.766
As a matter of fact, I think
a lot of my design ideas

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.782
come from mistakes and tricks of the eye.

00:01:19.806 --> 00:01:23.702
Because I feel like, you know,
there are so many images out there,

00:01:23.726 --> 00:01:25.916
so many clothes out there.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.592
And the only ones
that look interesting to me

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:32.306
are the ones that look
slightly mistaken, of course,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.180
or very, very surprising.

00:01:34.204 --> 00:01:36.491
And often, I'm driving in a taxi,

00:01:36.515 --> 00:01:40.226
and I see a hole in a shirt or something
that looks very interesting

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.749
or pretty or functional

00:01:41.773 --> 00:01:44.932
in some way that I'd never
seen happen before.

00:01:44.956 --> 00:01:49.243
And so I'd make the car stop,
and I'd get out of the car and walk

00:01:49.267 --> 00:01:51.589
and see that, in fact,
there wasn't a hole,

00:01:51.613 --> 00:01:54.368
but it was a trick of my eye;
it was a shadow, you know.

00:01:54.392 --> 00:01:56.798
Or if there was a hole,
I'd think like, "Oh, damn.

00:01:56.822 --> 00:01:59.184
Actually, someone thought
of that thought already.

00:01:59.208 --> 00:02:02.139
Someone made that mistake already,
so I can't do it anymore."

00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:05.033
I don't know where inspiration comes from.

00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:09.306
It does not come, for me, from research.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.743
I don't get necessarily
inspired by research.

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:12.918
As a matter of fact,

00:02:12.942 --> 00:02:15.835
one of the most fun things
I've ever done in my whole life

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.783
was this Christmas season
at the Guggenheim in New York.

00:02:18.807 --> 00:02:22.727
I read "Peter and the Wolf"
with this beautiful band from Juilliard,

00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:25.375
and I did, like, you know,
the narrator, and I read it.

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:27.780
And I saw this really
smart critic who I love,

00:02:27.804 --> 00:02:30.102
this woman Joan Acocella,
who's a friend of mine.

00:02:30.126 --> 00:02:31.662
And she came backstage and said,

00:02:31.686 --> 00:02:34.955
"Oh, Isaac, did you know that --
talk to me about Stalinism

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.718
and talk to me about, you know,
like, the '30s in Russia."

00:02:37.742 --> 00:02:40.273
And I thought, "How do I know
about Stalinism?"

00:02:40.297 --> 00:02:42.320
I know about a wolf and a bird,

00:02:42.344 --> 00:02:43.946
and, you know, he ate the bird,

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.403
and then in the end, you know,
you hear the bird squeaking or something.

00:02:47.427 --> 00:02:48.438
(Laughter)

00:02:48.462 --> 00:02:50.666
So I don't really know that,
I don't really --

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.162
actually, I do my own kind
of research, you know?

00:02:53.186 --> 00:02:56.667
If I'm commissioned to do the costumes
for an 18th-century opera

00:02:56.691 --> 00:02:58.093
or something like that,

00:02:58.117 --> 00:03:00.725
I will do a lot of research,
because it's interesting,

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:03.566
not because it's what I'm supposed to do.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.306
I'm very, very, very inspired by movies.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.306
The color of movies
and the way light makes the colors.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.614
Light from behind the projection
or light from the projection

00:03:14.638 --> 00:03:17.306
makes the colors look so impossible.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.215
Anyway, roll this little clip.
I'll just show you.

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.714
I sit up at night, and I watch movies,

00:03:23.738 --> 00:03:26.008
and I watch women in movies a lot.

00:03:26.032 --> 00:03:29.146
And I think about, you know, their roles

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.491
and about how you have to, like,
watch what your daughters look at.

00:03:33.515 --> 00:03:36.904
Because I look at the way women
are portrayed all the time,

00:03:36.928 --> 00:03:39.996
whether they're kind of
glorified in this way,

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.667
or whether they're kind of,
you know, ironically glorified,

00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:51.147
or whether they're sort of denigrated
or ironically denigrated.

00:03:51.171 --> 00:03:53.099
I go back to color all the time.

00:03:53.123 --> 00:03:57.936
Color is something
that motivates me a lot.

00:03:58.495 --> 00:04:02.970
It's rarely color that I find in nature,

00:04:02.994 --> 00:04:07.956
although, you know,
juxtaposed next to artificial color,

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.718
natural color is so beautiful.

00:04:10.742 --> 00:04:13.447
So that's what I do. I study color a lot.

00:04:13.471 --> 00:04:19.976
But for the most part, I think,
like, how can I ever make anything

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.306
that is as beautiful
as that image of Natalie Wood?

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.425
How can I ever make anything
as beautiful as Greta Garbo?

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.199
I mean, that's just not
possible. You know?

00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:34.742
And so that's what makes me
lie awake at night, I guess.

00:04:35.474 --> 00:04:39.566
I'm also like a big --

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.674
I go to astrologers
and tarot card readers often,

00:04:42.698 --> 00:04:44.996
and that's another thing
that motivates me a lot.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.306
People say, "Do that" -- an astrologer
tells me to do something,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.481
so I do it.

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:50.507
(Laughter)

00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:54.422
When I was about 21, an astrologer told me

00:04:54.446 --> 00:04:56.601
that I was going to meet
the man of my dreams,

00:04:56.625 --> 00:04:59.041
and that his name was going
to be Eric, right?

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:01.559
So, you know, for years I would go to bars

00:05:01.583 --> 00:05:03.818
and, sort of, anyone I met
whose name was Eric,

00:05:03.842 --> 00:05:05.913
I was humping immediately or something.

00:05:05.937 --> 00:05:08.242
(Laughter)

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.232
There were times when I was so desperate,

00:05:10.256 --> 00:05:12.359
I would just walk into a room
and go, "Eric?"

00:05:12.383 --> 00:05:15.329
And anybody who would turn around,
I would make a beeline for.

00:05:15.353 --> 00:05:16.444
(Laughter)

00:05:16.468 --> 00:05:19.700
And I had this really interesting
tarot reading a long time ago.

00:05:19.724 --> 00:05:22.873
The last card he pulled,
which was representing my destiny,

00:05:22.897 --> 00:05:25.259
was this guy in, like,
a straw boater with a cane

00:05:25.283 --> 00:05:28.798
and, you know, sort of spats and this,
you know, a minstrel singer, right?

00:05:28.822 --> 00:05:30.214
I want to show you this clip,

00:05:30.238 --> 00:05:34.463
because I do this kind of crazy thing
where I do a cabaret act.

00:05:34.487 --> 00:05:35.878
So actually, check this out.

00:05:35.902 --> 00:05:37.053
Very embarrassing.

00:05:37.077 --> 00:05:38.495
(Video) (Applause)

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:42.769
Thank you. We'll do anything you ask.

00:05:42.793 --> 00:05:47.608
The name of the show is based
on this story that I have to tell you,

00:05:47.632 --> 00:05:48.794
about my mother.

00:05:48.818 --> 00:05:50.943
It's sort of an excerpt
from a quote of hers.

00:05:50.967 --> 00:05:52.375
I was dating this guy, right?

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:55.815
And this has to do
with being happy, I swear.

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:02.201
I was dating this guy,
and it was going on for about a year,

00:06:02.225 --> 00:06:03.568
and we were getting serious,

00:06:03.592 --> 00:06:06.225
so we decided to invite them all
to dinner, our parents.

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:07.868
We introduced them to each other.

00:06:07.892 --> 00:06:10.586
My mother was, sort of,
very sensitive to his mother,

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.123
who, it seemed, was a little bit skeptical

00:06:13.147 --> 00:06:15.688
about the whole
"alternative lifestyle" thing --

00:06:15.712 --> 00:06:17.201
you know, homosexuality.

00:06:17.225 --> 00:06:20.201
So my mother was a little offended,
and turned to her and said,

00:06:20.225 --> 00:06:22.816
"Are you kidding? They have
the greatest life together.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.101
They eat out, they see shows ..."

00:06:25.831 --> 00:06:27.306
They eat out, they see shows.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.443
(Laughter)

00:06:28.467 --> 00:06:30.896
That's the name of the show,
"They eat out, they --"

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.913
That's on my tombstone when I die:

00:06:32.937 --> 00:06:35.573
"He ate out, he saw shows." Right?

00:06:35.597 --> 00:06:37.597
(Laughter)

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.368
So in editing these clips,

00:06:40.392 --> 00:06:44.816
I didn't have the audacity
to edit a clip of me singing at Joe's Pub.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.824
So you'll have to go check it out
and come see me or something,

00:06:47.848 --> 00:06:48.999
because it's mortifying.

00:06:49.023 --> 00:06:52.619
And yet, it feels --

00:06:52.643 --> 00:06:54.156
I don't know how to put this.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:00.417
I feel as little comfort as possible
is a good thing. You know?

00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:03.703
And at least, you know, in my case,

00:07:03.727 --> 00:07:07.100
because if I just do
one thing all the time,

00:07:07.124 --> 00:07:12.986
I don't know, I get very, very bored.
I bore very easily.

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:19.748
And you know, I don't say
that I do everything well.

00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:22.448
I just say that I do a lot
of things, that's all.

00:07:22.472 --> 00:07:26.623
And I kind of try
not to look back, you know?

00:07:26.647 --> 00:07:29.630
Except, I guess that's what staying up
every night is about --

00:07:29.654 --> 00:07:32.864
like, looking back and thinking,
"What a fool you made of yourself."

00:07:32.888 --> 00:07:34.042
You know?

00:07:34.066 --> 00:07:35.722
But I guess that's OK. Right?

00:07:36.178 --> 00:07:37.214
(Laughter)

00:07:37.238 --> 00:07:38.692
Because if you do many things,

00:07:38.716 --> 00:07:42.147
you get to feel lousy about everything,
and not just one, you know?

00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:45.306
You don't master feeling lousy
about one thing.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.480
Yeah, exactly.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.019
I will show you this next thing,

00:07:51.043 --> 00:07:52.591
speaking of costumes for operas.

00:07:52.615 --> 00:07:54.559
I do work with different choreographers.

00:07:54.583 --> 00:07:56.486
I work with Twyla Tharp a lot

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.322
and I work with Mark Morris a lot,

00:07:58.346 --> 00:07:59.791
who is one of my best friends.

00:07:59.815 --> 00:08:03.306
And I designed three operas with him --

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.034
the most recent one, "King Arthur."

00:08:06.058 --> 00:08:08.663
I've been very ingrained
in the dance world

00:08:08.687 --> 00:08:09.838
since I was a teenager.

00:08:09.862 --> 00:08:11.767
I went to a performing arts high school,

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:13.005
where I was an actor,

00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:15.139
and many of my friends
were ballet dancers.

00:08:15.163 --> 00:08:18.764
Again, I don't know
where inspiration comes from.

00:08:18.788 --> 00:08:20.933
I don't know where it comes from.

00:08:20.957 --> 00:08:23.396
I started making puppets when I was a kid.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.889
Maybe that's where the whole inspiration
thing started from: puppets.

00:08:26.913 --> 00:08:28.021
(Laughter)

00:08:28.045 --> 00:08:29.831
And then performing arts high school.

00:08:29.855 --> 00:08:33.117
There I was in high school,
meeting dancers and acting.

00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:37.543
And somehow, from there,
I got interested in design.

00:08:37.567 --> 00:08:39.898
I went to Parsons School of Design,

00:08:39.922 --> 00:08:42.639
and then I began my career as a designer.

00:08:43.282 --> 00:08:45.389
I don't really think of myself
as a designer,

00:08:45.413 --> 00:08:48.679
and I don't really think of myself
necessarily as a fashion designer.

00:08:48.703 --> 00:08:51.200
And frankly, I don't really know
what to call myself.

00:08:51.224 --> 00:08:53.628
I think of myself as ...

00:08:53.652 --> 00:08:56.092
I don't know what I think
of myself as, so ...

00:08:56.116 --> 00:08:57.282
That's just that.

00:08:57.306 --> 00:09:00.000
(Laughter)

00:09:00.024 --> 00:09:03.638
But I must say, this whole thing
about being slightly bored all the time,

00:09:03.662 --> 00:09:07.356
I think that is a very important thing
for a fashion designer.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.342
You always have to be, like,
slightly bored with everything.

00:09:10.366 --> 00:09:13.989
And if you're not, you have to pretend
to be slightly bored with everything.

00:09:14.013 --> 00:09:15.346
(Laughter)

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.741
But I am really a little bored
with everything.

00:09:17.765 --> 00:09:21.835
I always say to my partner,
Marisa Gardini, who books everything --

00:09:21.859 --> 00:09:23.943
books everything
and makes everything happen

00:09:23.967 --> 00:09:25.214
and makes all the deals.

00:09:25.238 --> 00:09:28.910
And I always tell her
that I find myself with a lot of time

00:09:28.934 --> 00:09:30.984
on the computer bridge program.

00:09:31.008 --> 00:09:35.870
Too much time on computer bridge,
which is, you know, like, that's --

00:09:35.894 --> 00:09:38.782
So, somehow, like, about 10 years ago,

00:09:38.806 --> 00:09:42.445
I thought that the most
unboring place in the world

00:09:42.469 --> 00:09:45.194
would be, like, a TV studio,
like for a day show,

00:09:45.218 --> 00:09:46.669
some kind of day talk show,

00:09:46.693 --> 00:09:50.285
because it's all of these
things that I love

00:09:50.309 --> 00:09:51.521
kind of in one place.

00:09:51.545 --> 00:09:54.232
And if you ever get bored,
you can look at another thing

00:09:54.256 --> 00:09:56.563
and do another thing
and talk about it, right?

00:09:57.028 --> 00:09:59.091
And so I had this TV show.

00:09:59.115 --> 00:10:02.116
And that was a very, very,
very big part of my process.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.141
Actually, could you roll the clip, please?

00:10:04.165 --> 00:10:06.594
This is one of my favorite
clips of Rosie O'Donnell.

00:10:06.618 --> 00:10:09.166
(Video) Isaac Mizrahi:
We're back on the set. Hi, Ben!

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:10.528
Rosie O'Donnell: Hello, Ben.

00:10:10.552 --> 00:10:12.946
IM: Look how cute she looks
with just a slick back.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:14.785
Ben: As my grandmother says, "Delish!"

00:10:14.809 --> 00:10:15.976
RO: Delish!

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.151
IM: Wow, delish.

00:10:17.175 --> 00:10:19.306
All right. So where
should I position myself?

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:22.820
I want to stay out of the way.
I don't want to be -- OK, here we go.

00:10:22.844 --> 00:10:24.575
RO: Do you get nervous, Ashley?

00:10:24.599 --> 00:10:26.430
Ashley: Doing what?
RO: Cutting hair.

00:10:26.454 --> 00:10:30.129
A: Never. I don't think there was ever
a day when I cut hair I was nervous.

00:10:30.153 --> 00:10:32.838
IM: You look so cute already.
RO: You like it? All right.

00:10:32.862 --> 00:10:36.385
IM: Do you have a problem looking cute?
RO: Of course I want to look cute.

00:10:36.409 --> 00:10:40.238
IM: Just checking, because some people
want to look, you know, aggressively ugly.

00:10:40.262 --> 00:10:41.413
RO: No, not me, no.

00:10:41.437 --> 00:10:44.711
IM: You read about people
who have a lot of money and they have kids

00:10:44.735 --> 00:10:48.433
and the kids always end up somehow,
really messed up, you know?

00:10:48.457 --> 00:10:51.658
And there's got to be
some way to do that, Rosie.

00:10:51.682 --> 00:10:55.591
Just because you're fabulously rich
and fabulously famous,

00:10:55.615 --> 00:10:57.474
does that mean you shouldn't have kids,

00:10:57.498 --> 00:10:59.893
because you know they're going
to end up messed up?

00:10:59.917 --> 00:11:03.557
RO: No, but it means your priority
has to be their well-being first, I think.

00:11:03.581 --> 00:11:05.785
But you have to make
the decision for yourself.

00:11:05.809 --> 00:11:07.639
My kids are seven, who the hell knows?

00:11:07.663 --> 00:11:09.640
They're going to be like 14 and in rehab.

00:11:09.664 --> 00:11:12.906
And they're going to be playing this clip.
"I'm such a good mother."

00:11:14.035 --> 00:11:16.044
My God, this is the shortest
I've ever had!

00:11:16.068 --> 00:11:17.219
IM: It looks good, yeah?

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:20.941
A: Has your hair ever been this short?
RO: No! But it's all right -- go crazy.

00:11:20.965 --> 00:11:23.224
IM: I feel like it needs to be
closer down here.

00:11:23.248 --> 00:11:25.499
A: It's just a stage.
RO: We're just staging it.

00:11:25.523 --> 00:11:27.397
IM: Are you freaking out? It's so cute.

00:11:27.421 --> 00:11:30.097
RO: No, I love it. It's the new me.
IM: It's so fabulous!

00:11:30.121 --> 00:11:31.477
RO: Flock of Rosie. Wooo!

00:11:32.165 --> 00:11:33.582
(Laughter)

00:11:33.606 --> 00:11:38.022
IM: By the way, of all the most unboring
things in the world, right?

00:11:38.046 --> 00:11:41.610
I mean, like, making someone who's
already cute look terrible like that --

00:11:41.634 --> 00:11:42.664
(Laughter)

00:11:42.688 --> 00:11:45.455
That is not boring.
That is nothing if it's not boring.

00:11:45.479 --> 00:11:46.486
(Laughter)

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:50.890
Actually, I read this great
quote the other day, which was,

00:11:50.914 --> 00:11:52.649
"Style makes you feel great,

00:11:52.673 --> 00:11:55.866
because it takes your mind off the fact
that you're going to die."

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.041
Right?

00:11:57.065 --> 00:11:58.116
(Laughter)

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.855
And then I realized
that was on my website,

00:12:00.879 --> 00:12:03.442
and it said, you know,
the quote was attributed to me.

00:12:03.466 --> 00:12:07.162
And I thought, "Oh, I said something
in an interview. I forgot I said that."

00:12:07.186 --> 00:12:08.526
But it's really true.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:13.230
I want to show you this last clip
because it's going to be my last goodbye.

00:12:13.254 --> 00:12:15.054
I'll tell you that I cook a lot also.

00:12:15.078 --> 00:12:16.516
I love to cook.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.617
And I often look at things
as though they're food.

00:12:19.641 --> 00:12:21.884
Like, I say, "Would you serve
a rotten chicken?

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:24.629
Then how could you serve
a beat-up old dress or something?

00:12:24.653 --> 00:12:26.618
How could you show a beat-up old dress?"

00:12:26.642 --> 00:12:29.369
I always relate things to kitchen-ry.

00:12:29.393 --> 00:12:30.456
(Laughter)

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.438
And so I think
that's what it all boils down to.

00:12:33.462 --> 00:12:35.020
Everything boils down to that.

00:12:35.044 --> 00:12:36.201
So check this out.

00:12:36.225 --> 00:12:37.610
This is what I've been doing,

00:12:37.634 --> 00:12:40.115
because I think it's the most
fun thing in the world.

00:12:40.139 --> 00:12:43.051
It's, like, this website
with a lot of different things on it.

00:12:43.075 --> 00:12:44.615
It's a polymathematical website.

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:47.766
We actually shoot segments,
like TV show segments.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:50.674
And it's kind of my favorite
thing in the world.

00:12:50.698 --> 00:12:53.917
And it just began, like, in the beginning
of February. So who knows?

00:12:53.941 --> 00:12:57.448
Again, I don't say it's good,
I just think it's not boring, right?

00:12:57.472 --> 00:12:58.973
And here's the last bit.

00:12:58.997 --> 00:13:01.528
(Music)

00:13:01.924 --> 00:13:06.171
IM: I make buttermilk pancakes
or buttermilk waffles all the time.

00:13:06.195 --> 00:13:07.346
Sara Moulton: Do you?

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.014
IM: Yeah, but I can never
find buttermilk, ever.

00:13:10.038 --> 00:13:12.485
You can't find it at Citarella,
you can't find it.

00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:14.426
SM: You can't?
IM: It's always low-fat.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.430
SM: But that's all it is.
IM: It is? OK.

00:13:16.454 --> 00:13:19.306
SM: You don't know?
Let me tell you something interesting.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.637
IM: You know what?
Stop laughing! It's not funny.

00:13:21.661 --> 00:13:24.860
Just because I don't know
there's no such thing as whole buttermilk.

00:13:24.884 --> 00:13:26.035
Sorry. What?

00:13:26.059 --> 00:13:29.397
SM: Here's the deal: in the old days,
when they used to make butter --

00:13:29.421 --> 00:13:30.807
You know how you make butter?

00:13:30.831 --> 00:13:32.124
IM: Churn.
SM: From cream.

00:13:32.148 --> 00:13:33.299
IM: Yeah, exactly.

00:13:33.323 --> 00:13:36.372
SM: So you take heavy,
high-fat milk, which is cream,

00:13:36.396 --> 00:13:40.936
and you churn it until it separates
into these curds and water.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.845
The liquid is actually -- if you've
ever overbeaten your whipped cream,

00:13:44.869 --> 00:13:46.511
it's actually buttermilk.

00:13:46.535 --> 00:13:48.306
That's what it was in the early days.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.306
And that's what people used
for baking and all sorts of things.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.407
Now the buttermilk that you get
is actually low-fat or skim milk.

00:13:54.431 --> 00:13:56.340
IM: Excuse me, I didn't know. Alright?

00:13:56.364 --> 00:13:58.029
SM: The reason he thought that

00:13:58.053 --> 00:14:01.461
is because buttermilk is so
wonderfully thick and delicious.

00:14:01.485 --> 00:14:02.698
IM: Yeah, it is. Exactly.

00:14:02.722 --> 00:14:04.860
SM: So who would think
that it was low-fat?

00:14:04.884 --> 00:14:06.987
IM: Well, that's it. Thank you very much.

00:14:07.011 --> 00:14:10.273
Happy TED. It's so wonderful here.
I love it. I love it. I love it.

00:14:10.297 --> 00:14:11.536
Thanks. Bye.
