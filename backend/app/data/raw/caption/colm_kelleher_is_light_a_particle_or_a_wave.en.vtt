00:00:14.603 --> 00:00:18.085
You look down and see a yellow pencil lying on your desk.

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:20.385
Your eyes, and then your brain, are collecting

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:23.000
all sorts of information about the pencil:

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.566
its size,

00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:24.090
color,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.520
shape,

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.272
distance,

00:00:25.272 --> 00:00:26.675
and more.

00:00:26.675 --> 00:00:28.890
But, how exactly does this happen?

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.044
The ancient Greeks were the first

00:00:30.044 --> 00:00:31.758
to think more or less scientifically

00:00:31.758 --> 00:00:34.401
about what light is and how vision works.

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.284
Some Greek philosophers,

00:00:35.284 --> 00:00:37.428
including Plato and Pythagoras,

00:00:37.428 --> 00:00:39.334
thought that light originated in our eyes

00:00:39.334 --> 00:00:41.936
and that vision happened when little, invisible probes

00:00:41.936 --> 00:00:44.848
were sent to gather information about far-away objects.

00:00:44.848 --> 00:00:46.182
It took over a thousand years

00:00:46.182 --> 00:00:48.405
before the Arab scientist, Alhazen,

00:00:48.405 --> 00:00:52.119
figured out that the old, Greek theory of light couldn't be right.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:54.923
In Alhazen's picture, your eyes don't send out

00:00:54.923 --> 00:00:57.012
invisible, intelligence-gathering probes,

00:00:57.012 --> 00:01:00.176
they simply collect the light that falls into them.

00:01:00.176 --> 00:01:02.321
Alhazen's theory accounts for a fact

00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:04.566
that the Greek's couldn't easily explain:

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.893
why it gets dark sometimes.

00:01:06.893 --> 00:01:10.795
The idea is that very few objects actually emit their own light.

00:01:10.795 --> 00:01:13.109
The special, light-emitting objects,

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:14.091
like the sun

00:01:14.091 --> 00:01:14.937
or a lightbulb,

00:01:14.937 --> 00:01:17.506
are known as sources of light.

00:01:17.506 --> 00:01:18.724
Most of the things we see,

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:20.330
like that pencil on your desk,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.895
are simply reflecting light from a source

00:01:22.895 --> 00:01:24.770
rather than producing their own.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.785
So, when you look at your pencil,

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:29.610
the light that hits your eye actually originated at the sun

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.589
and has traveled millions of miles across empty space

00:01:32.589 --> 00:01:35.404
before bouncing off the pencil and into your eye,

00:01:35.404 --> 00:01:37.616
which is pretty cool when you think about it.

00:01:37.616 --> 00:01:40.413
But, what exactly is the stuff that is emitted from the sun

00:01:40.413 --> 00:01:42.134
and how do we see it?

00:01:42.134 --> 00:01:43.885
Is it a particle, like atoms,

00:01:43.885 --> 00:01:47.518
or is it a wave, like ripples on the surface of a pond?

00:01:47.518 --> 00:01:50.377
Scientists in the modern era would spend a couple of hundred years

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:52.658
figuring out the answer to this question.

00:01:52.658 --> 00:01:54.429
Isaac Newton was one of the earliest.

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.186
Newton believed that light is made up

00:01:56.186 --> 00:02:00.108
of tiny, atom-like particles, which he called corpuscles.

00:02:00.108 --> 00:02:03.984
Using this assumption, he was able to explain some properties of light.

00:02:03.984 --> 00:02:05.378
For example, refraction,

00:02:05.378 --> 00:02:07.738
which is how a beam of light appears to bend

00:02:07.738 --> 00:02:09.744
as it passes from air into water.

00:02:09.744 --> 00:02:13.865
But, in science, even geniuses sometimes get things wrong.

00:02:13.865 --> 00:02:16.683
In the 19th century, long after Newton died,

00:02:16.683 --> 00:02:18.788
scientists did a series of experiments

00:02:18.788 --> 00:02:21.372
that clearly showed that light can't be made up

00:02:21.372 --> 00:02:23.965
of tiny, atom-like particles.

00:02:23.965 --> 00:02:26.900
For one thing, two beams of light that cross paths

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.344
don't interact with each other at all.

00:02:29.344 --> 00:02:31.711
If light were made of tiny, solid balls,

00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:34.642
then you would expect that some of the particles from Beam A

00:02:34.642 --> 00:02:37.385
would crash into some of the particles from Beam B.

00:02:37.385 --> 00:02:39.879
If that happened, the two particles involved in the collision

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.210
would bounce off in random directions.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.687
But, that doesn't happen.

00:02:43.687 --> 00:02:45.627
The beams of light pass right through each other

00:02:45.627 --> 00:02:46.677
as you can check for yourself

00:02:46.677 --> 00:02:48.939
with two laser pointers and some chalk dust.

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.444
For another thing, light makes interference patterns.

00:02:51.444 --> 00:02:54.946
Interference patterns are the complicated undulations that happen

00:02:54.946 --> 00:02:57.981
when two wave patterns occupy the same space.

00:02:57.981 --> 00:02:59.531
They can be seen when two objects

00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:01.755
disturb the surface of a still pond,

00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:04.205
and also when two point-like sources of light

00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:06.394
are placed near each other.

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:08.136
Only waves make interference patterns,

00:03:08.136 --> 00:03:09.636
particles don't.

00:03:09.636 --> 00:03:12.992
And, as a bonus, understanding that light acts like a wave

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:15.992
leads naturally to an explanation of what color is

00:03:15.992 --> 00:03:17.695
and why that pencil looks yellow.

00:03:17.695 --> 00:03:21.036
So, it's settled then, light is a wave, right?

00:03:21.036 --> 00:03:22.687
Not so fast!

00:03:22.687 --> 00:03:25.378
In the 20th century, scientists did experiments

00:03:25.378 --> 00:03:28.432
that appear to show light acting like a particle.

00:03:28.432 --> 00:03:31.144
For instance, when you shine light on a metal,

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:34.402
the light transfers its energy to the atoms in the metal

00:03:34.402 --> 00:03:37.099
in discrete packets called quanta.

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.801
But, we can't just forget about properties like interference, either.

00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:43.166
So these quanta of light aren't at all like

00:03:43.166 --> 00:03:45.999
the tiny, hard spheres Newton imagined.

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:48.752
This result, that light sometimes behaves like a particle

00:03:48.752 --> 00:03:51.142
and sometimes behaves like a wave,

00:03:51.142 --> 00:03:53.402
led to a revolutionary new physics theory called

00:03:53.402 --> 00:03:55.652
quantum mechanics.

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:58.599
So, after all that, let's go back to the question,

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.075
"What is light?"

00:04:00.075 --> 00:04:02.473
Well, light isn't really like anything

00:04:02.473 --> 00:04:04.902
we're used to dealing with in our everyday lives.

00:04:04.902 --> 00:04:06.733
Sometimes it behaves like a particle

00:04:06.733 --> 00:04:09.019
and other times it behaves like a wave,

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.730
but it isn't exactly like either.
