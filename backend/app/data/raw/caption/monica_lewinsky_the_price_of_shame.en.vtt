00:00:12.763 --> 00:00:17.737
You're looking at a woman
who was publicly silent for a decade.

00:00:18.464 --> 00:00:20.290
Obviously, that's changed,

00:00:20.863 --> 00:00:22.277
but only recently.

00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:27.408
It was several months ago that I gave
my very first major public talk,

00:00:27.432 --> 00:00:30.193
at the Forbes "30 Under 30 Summit" --

00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:34.431
1,500 brilliant people,
all under the age of 30.

00:00:35.223 --> 00:00:41.625
That meant that in 1998,
the oldest among the group were only 14,

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.969
and the youngest, just four.

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:49.994
I joked with them that some might only
have heard of me from rap songs.

00:00:50.485 --> 00:00:52.487
Yes, I'm in rap songs.

00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:53.575
(Laughter)

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:56.583
Almost 40 rap songs.

00:00:56.607 --> 00:00:58.165
(Laughter)

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.407
But the night of my speech,
a surprising thing happened.

00:01:02.144 --> 00:01:08.116
At the age of 41, I was hit on
by a 27-year-old guy.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.142
(Laughter)

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:10.725
I know, right?

00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:14.698
He was charming, and I was flattered,

00:01:14.722 --> 00:01:16.457
and I declined.

00:01:17.212 --> 00:01:19.732
You know what his unsuccessful
pickup line was?

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.671
He could make me feel 22 again.

00:01:23.695 --> 00:01:27.739
(Laughter)

00:01:27.763 --> 00:01:30.613
(Applause)

00:01:30.637 --> 00:01:32.630
I realized, later that night,

00:01:32.654 --> 00:01:38.139
I'm probably the only person over 40
who does not want to be 22 again.

00:01:38.163 --> 00:01:41.085
(Laughter)

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:46.886
(Applause)

00:01:47.554 --> 00:01:51.747
At the age of 22,
I fell in love with my boss.

00:01:52.723 --> 00:01:55.091
And at the age of 24,

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.703
I learned the devastating consequences.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.847
Can I see a show of hands of anyone here

00:02:02.871 --> 00:02:06.988
who didn't make a mistake
or do something they regretted at 22?

00:02:09.232 --> 00:02:11.718
Yep. That's what I thought.

00:02:12.473 --> 00:02:18.230
So like me, at 22, a few of you
may have also taken wrong turns

00:02:18.254 --> 00:02:21.584
and fallen in love with the wrong person,

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:23.307
maybe even your boss.

00:02:24.313 --> 00:02:26.035
Unlike me, though,

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:30.516
your boss probably wasn't the president
of the United States of America.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.580
(Laughter)

00:02:31.604 --> 00:02:34.084
Of course, life is full of surprises.

00:02:35.877 --> 00:02:40.737
Not a day goes by that I'm not
reminded of my mistake,

00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:43.034
and I regret that mistake deeply.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:52.177
In 1998, after having been swept up
into an improbable romance,

00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:57.961
I was then swept up into the eye
of a political, legal and media maelstrom

00:02:57.985 --> 00:03:00.192
like we had never seen before.

00:03:01.082 --> 00:03:03.710
Remember, just a few years earlier,

00:03:03.734 --> 00:03:07.047
news was consumed from just three places:

00:03:07.071 --> 00:03:09.313
reading a newspaper or magazine,

00:03:09.337 --> 00:03:11.051
listening to the radio

00:03:11.075 --> 00:03:12.658
or watching television.

00:03:12.682 --> 00:03:14.280
That was it.

00:03:14.304 --> 00:03:17.042
But that wasn't my fate.

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.734
Instead, this scandal was brought to you

00:03:21.758 --> 00:03:23.636
by the digital revolution.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.862
That meant we could access
all the information we wanted,

00:03:27.886 --> 00:03:31.420
when we wanted it, anytime, anywhere.

00:03:32.976 --> 00:03:37.033
And when the story broke in January 1998,

00:03:37.057 --> 00:03:39.034
it broke online.

00:03:39.835 --> 00:03:44.313
It was the first time the traditional news
was usurped by the internet

00:03:44.337 --> 00:03:46.076
for a major news story --

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:50.917
a click that reverberated
around the world.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.898
What that meant for me personally

00:03:54.922 --> 00:04:00.311
was that overnight, I went from being
a completely private figure

00:04:00.335 --> 00:04:04.076
to a publicly humiliated one, worldwide.

00:04:05.272 --> 00:04:11.262
I was patient zero of losing
a personal reputation on a global scale

00:04:11.286 --> 00:04:13.421
almost instantaneously.

00:04:15.381 --> 00:04:18.257
This rush to judgment,
enabled by technology,

00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:21.358
led to mobs of virtual stone-throwers.

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.803
Granted, it was before social media,

00:04:24.827 --> 00:04:28.207
but people could still comment online,

00:04:28.231 --> 00:04:29.906
e-mail stories,

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.941
and, of course, e-mail cruel jokes.

00:04:34.714 --> 00:04:37.977
News sources plastered
photos of me all over

00:04:38.001 --> 00:04:41.581
to sell newspapers, banner ads online,

00:04:41.605 --> 00:04:43.906
and to keep people tuned to the TV.

00:04:45.962 --> 00:04:51.353
Do you recall a particular image of me,
say, wearing a beret?

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.084
Now, I admit I made mistakes --

00:04:56.108 --> 00:04:58.254
especially wearing that beret.

00:04:58.278 --> 00:05:00.204
(Laughter)

00:05:00.228 --> 00:05:02.890
But the attention and judgment
that I received --

00:05:02.914 --> 00:05:06.237
not the story, but that
I personally received --

00:05:06.261 --> 00:05:07.821
was unprecedented.

00:05:08.713 --> 00:05:11.163
I was branded as a tramp,

00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:13.626
tart,

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.340
slut,

00:05:15.364 --> 00:05:16.975
whore,

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:18.149
bimbo,

00:05:18.855 --> 00:05:20.972
and, of course, "that woman."

00:05:22.662 --> 00:05:24.709
I was seen by many,

00:05:24.733 --> 00:05:27.196
but actually known by few.

00:05:28.863 --> 00:05:31.958
And I get it: it was easy to forget

00:05:31.982 --> 00:05:34.763
that that woman was dimensional,

00:05:34.787 --> 00:05:36.554
had a soul

00:05:36.578 --> 00:05:38.170
and was once unbroken.

00:05:41.346 --> 00:05:45.882
When this happened to me 17 years ago,
there was no name for it.

00:05:46.604 --> 00:05:50.521
Now we call it "cyberbullying"
and "online harassment."

00:05:52.584 --> 00:05:55.700
Today, I want to share
some of my experience with you,

00:05:55.724 --> 00:06:00.012
talk about how that experience has helped
shape my cultural observations,

00:06:01.201 --> 00:06:04.597
and how I hope my past experience
can lead to a change

00:06:04.621 --> 00:06:07.241
that results in less suffering for others.

00:06:09.887 --> 00:06:15.136
In 1998, I lost my reputation
and my dignity.

00:06:15.734 --> 00:06:18.321
I lost almost everything.

00:06:19.226 --> 00:06:21.231
And I almost lost my life.

00:06:25.031 --> 00:06:26.809
Let me paint a picture for you.

00:06:29.365 --> 00:06:32.215
It is September of 1998.

00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:35.690
I'm sitting in a windowless office room

00:06:35.714 --> 00:06:38.197
inside the Office
of the Independent Counsel,

00:06:39.213 --> 00:06:42.040
underneath humming fluorescent lights.

00:06:42.892 --> 00:06:45.997
I'm listening to the sound of my voice,

00:06:46.974 --> 00:06:50.350
my voice on surreptitiously
taped phone calls

00:06:50.374 --> 00:06:53.034
that a supposed friend
had made the year before.

00:06:54.018 --> 00:06:57.307
I'm here because
I've been legally required

00:06:57.331 --> 00:07:02.997
to personally authenticate
all 20 hours of taped conversation.

00:07:04.916 --> 00:07:08.997
For the past eight months,
the mysterious content of these tapes

00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:11.897
has hung like the sword
of Damocles over my head.

00:07:12.747 --> 00:07:15.714
I mean, who can remember
what they said a year ago?

00:07:17.587 --> 00:07:20.599
Scared and mortified, I listen,

00:07:22.846 --> 00:07:26.755
listen as I prattle on about the flotsam
and jetsam of the day;

00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:31.128
listen as I confess my love
for the president,

00:07:31.152 --> 00:07:33.337
and, of course, my heartbreak;

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:40.134
listen to my sometimes catty,
sometimes churlish, sometimes silly self

00:07:40.158 --> 00:07:44.031
being cruel, unforgiving, uncouth;

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:50.340
listen, deeply, deeply ashamed,
to the worst version of myself,

00:07:51.363 --> 00:07:53.719
a self I don't even recognize.

00:07:56.537 --> 00:08:00.382
A few days later, the Starr Report
is released to Congress,

00:08:00.406 --> 00:08:05.204
and all of those tapes and transcripts,
those stolen words, form a part of it.

00:08:06.694 --> 00:08:10.340
That people can read the transcripts
is horrific enough.

00:08:11.221 --> 00:08:12.742
But a few weeks later,

00:08:14.044 --> 00:08:16.709
the audiotapes are aired on TV,

00:08:16.733 --> 00:08:19.941
and significant portions
made available online.

00:08:22.597 --> 00:08:26.015
The public humiliation was excruciating.

00:08:26.911 --> 00:08:29.304
Life was almost unbearable.

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:38.095
This was not something that happened
with regularity back then in 1998,

00:08:38.119 --> 00:08:43.812
and by "this," I mean the stealing
of people's private words, actions,

00:08:43.836 --> 00:08:46.299
conversations or photos,

00:08:46.323 --> 00:08:47.942
and then making them public --

00:08:48.776 --> 00:08:50.458
public without consent,

00:08:51.214 --> 00:08:53.021
public without context

00:08:53.849 --> 00:08:56.129
and public without compassion.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:01.236
Fast-forward 12 years, to 2010,

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.706
and now social media has been born.

00:09:04.888 --> 00:09:09.897
The landscape has sadly become much
more populated with instances like mine,

00:09:09.921 --> 00:09:12.409
whether or not someone
actually made a mistake,

00:09:13.128 --> 00:09:17.584
and now, it's for both public
and private people.

00:09:18.682 --> 00:09:23.611
The consequences for some
have become dire, very dire.

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:30.878
I was on the phone with my mom
in September of 2010,

00:09:30.902 --> 00:09:34.296
and we were talking about the news
of a young college freshman

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.053
from Rutgers University,

00:09:36.077 --> 00:09:37.756
named Tyler Clementi.

00:09:38.724 --> 00:09:44.301
Sweet, sensitive, creative Tyler
was secretly webcammed by his roommate

00:09:44.325 --> 00:09:46.531
while being intimate with another man.

00:09:48.666 --> 00:09:51.271
When the online world
learned of this incident,

00:09:51.295 --> 00:09:54.430
the ridicule and cyberbullying ignited.

00:09:56.464 --> 00:09:57.692
A few days later,

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:01.641
Tyler jumped from
the George Washington Bridge

00:10:01.665 --> 00:10:02.900
to his death.

00:10:03.524 --> 00:10:04.913
He was 18.

00:10:07.453 --> 00:10:12.061
My mom was beside herself about
what happened to Tyler and his family,

00:10:12.085 --> 00:10:14.918
and she was gutted with pain

00:10:14.942 --> 00:10:17.761
in a way that I just couldn't
quite understand.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:23.164
And then eventually,
I realized she was reliving 1998,

00:10:24.021 --> 00:10:27.954
reliving a time when she sat
by my bed every night,

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:31.721
reliving -- (Chokes up)

00:10:31.745 --> 00:10:36.347
sorry -- reliving a time when she made me
shower with the bathroom door open,

00:10:37.416 --> 00:10:41.065
and reliving a time
when both of my parents feared

00:10:41.089 --> 00:10:43.888
that I would be humiliated to death,

00:10:43.912 --> 00:10:45.203
literally.

00:10:48.339 --> 00:10:52.030
Today, too many parents
haven't had the chance

00:10:52.054 --> 00:10:55.047
to step in and rescue their loved ones.

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:58.849
Too many have learned
of their child's suffering and humiliation

00:10:58.873 --> 00:11:00.862
after it was too late.

00:11:02.116 --> 00:11:05.951
Tyler's tragic, senseless death
was a turning point for me.

00:11:06.485 --> 00:11:10.332
It served to recontextualize
my experiences,

00:11:10.356 --> 00:11:14.894
and I then began to look at the world
of humiliation and bullying around me

00:11:14.918 --> 00:11:16.403
and see something different.

00:11:18.593 --> 00:11:21.575
In 1998, we had no way of knowing

00:11:21.599 --> 00:11:26.379
where this brave new technology
called the internet would take us.

00:11:26.403 --> 00:11:30.491
Since then, it has connected people
in unimaginable ways --

00:11:30.515 --> 00:11:32.567
joining lost siblings,

00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:34.158
saving lives,

00:11:34.182 --> 00:11:36.110
launching revolutions ...

00:11:37.087 --> 00:11:41.192
But the darkness, cyberbullying,
and slut-shaming that I experienced

00:11:41.216 --> 00:11:42.484
had mushroomed.

00:11:44.874 --> 00:11:49.575
Every day online, people --
especially young people,

00:11:49.599 --> 00:11:52.809
who are not developmentally
equipped to handle this --

00:11:52.833 --> 00:11:55.187
are so abused and humiliated

00:11:55.211 --> 00:11:58.329
that they can't imagine living
to the next day.

00:11:58.353 --> 00:12:00.628
And some, tragically, don't.

00:12:01.302 --> 00:12:03.453
And there's nothing virtual about that.

00:12:04.892 --> 00:12:11.374
Childline, a UK nonprofit that's focused
on helping young people on various issues,

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:14.470
released a staggering statistic
late last year:

00:12:15.558 --> 00:12:22.000
from 2012 to 2013,
there was an 87 percent increase

00:12:22.024 --> 00:12:25.445
in calls and e-mails
related to cyberbullying.

00:12:26.834 --> 00:12:29.126
A meta-analysis
done out of the Netherlands

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.007
showed that for the first time,

00:12:31.031 --> 00:12:36.179
cyberbullying was leading
to suicidal ideations

00:12:36.203 --> 00:12:39.181
more significantly than offline bullying.

00:12:40.379 --> 00:12:43.699
And you know, what shocked me --
although it shouldn't have --

00:12:43.723 --> 00:12:45.765
was other research last year

00:12:45.789 --> 00:12:51.204
that determined humiliation
was a more intensely felt emotion

00:12:51.228 --> 00:12:54.704
than either happiness or even anger.

00:12:56.371 --> 00:12:59.022
Cruelty to others is nothing new.

00:13:00.006 --> 00:13:05.709
But online, technologically
enhanced shaming is amplified,

00:13:05.733 --> 00:13:07.301
uncontained

00:13:07.325 --> 00:13:09.420
and permanently accessible.

00:13:11.213 --> 00:13:16.765
The echo of embarrassment used to extend
only as far as your family, village,

00:13:16.789 --> 00:13:18.451
school or community.

00:13:18.998 --> 00:13:22.080
But now, it's the online community too.

00:13:22.876 --> 00:13:27.312
Millions of people, often anonymously,
can stab you with their words,

00:13:27.336 --> 00:13:29.028
and that's a lot of pain.

00:13:29.735 --> 00:13:34.918
And there are no perimeters around
how many people can publicly observe you

00:13:34.942 --> 00:13:37.529
and put you in a public stockade.

00:13:39.415 --> 00:13:44.160
There is a very personal price
to public humiliation,

00:13:45.239 --> 00:13:49.017
and the growth of the internet
has jacked up that price.

00:13:52.045 --> 00:13:53.954
For nearly two decades now,

00:13:53.978 --> 00:13:58.734
we have slowly been sowing the seeds
of shame and public humiliation

00:13:58.758 --> 00:14:02.592
in our cultural soil,
both on- and offline.

00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:08.962
Gossip websites, paparazzi,
reality programming, politics,

00:14:08.986 --> 00:14:12.084
news outlets and sometimes hackers

00:14:12.108 --> 00:14:14.375
all traffic in shame.

00:14:14.837 --> 00:14:19.371
It's led to desensitization
and a permissive environment online,

00:14:19.395 --> 00:14:24.119
which lends itself to trolling,
invasion of privacy and cyberbullying.

00:14:25.217 --> 00:14:29.282
This shift has created
what Professor Nicolaus Mills calls

00:14:29.306 --> 00:14:31.750
"a culture of humiliation."

00:14:32.836 --> 00:14:37.161
Consider a few prominent examples
just from the past six months alone.

00:14:38.015 --> 00:14:43.076
Snapchat, the service which is used
mainly by younger generations

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:47.650
and claims that its messages
only have the life span of a few seconds.

00:14:47.674 --> 00:14:50.434
You can imagine the range
of content that that gets.

00:14:51.026 --> 00:14:56.626
A third-party app which Snapchatters use
to preserve the life span of the messages

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:58.143
was hacked,

00:14:58.167 --> 00:15:04.693
and 100,000 personal conversations,
photos and videos were leaked online,

00:15:04.717 --> 00:15:07.915
to now have a life span of forever.

00:15:08.983 --> 00:15:13.171
Jennifer Lawrence and several other actors
had their iCloud accounts hacked,

00:15:13.195 --> 00:15:17.119
and private, intimate, nude photos
were plastered across the internet

00:15:17.143 --> 00:15:18.844
without their permission.

00:15:18.868 --> 00:15:23.306
One gossip website
had over five million hits

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:24.913
for this one story.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.369
And what about
the Sony Pictures cyberhacking?

00:15:30.422 --> 00:15:33.499
The documents which received
the most attention

00:15:33.523 --> 00:15:38.131
were private e-mails that had
maximum public embarrassment value.

00:15:40.146 --> 00:15:42.502
But in this culture of humiliation,

00:15:42.526 --> 00:15:46.586
there is another kind of price tag
attached to public shaming.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.563
The price does not measure
the cost to the victim,

00:15:50.587 --> 00:15:52.930
which Tyler and too many others --

00:15:52.954 --> 00:15:57.888
notably, women, minorities
and members of the LGBTQ community --

00:15:57.912 --> 00:15:59.079
have paid,

00:15:59.103 --> 00:16:03.659
but the price measures the profit
of those who prey on them.

00:16:05.196 --> 00:16:08.662
This invasion of others is a raw material,

00:16:08.686 --> 00:16:14.630
efficiently and ruthlessly mined,
packaged and sold at a profit.

00:16:15.479 --> 00:16:21.096
A marketplace has emerged
where public humiliation is a commodity,

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.356
and shame is an industry.

00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:26.706
How is the money made?

00:16:27.699 --> 00:16:28.859
Clicks.

00:16:29.493 --> 00:16:31.819
The more shame, the more clicks.

00:16:31.843 --> 00:16:35.223
The more clicks,
the more advertising dollars.

00:16:37.428 --> 00:16:39.287
We're in a dangerous cycle.

00:16:39.914 --> 00:16:42.534
The more we click on this kind of gossip,

00:16:42.558 --> 00:16:45.487
the more numb we get
to the human lives behind it.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.266
And the more numb we get,
the more we click.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:52.699
All the while,

00:16:52.723 --> 00:16:56.895
someone is making money off of the back
of someone else's suffering.

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:01.334
With every click, we make a choice.

00:17:01.358 --> 00:17:04.839
The more we saturate our culture
with public shaming,

00:17:04.863 --> 00:17:06.770
the more accepted it is,

00:17:06.794 --> 00:17:11.109
the more we will see behavior
like cyberbullying, trolling,

00:17:11.133 --> 00:17:13.098
some forms of hacking

00:17:13.122 --> 00:17:14.765
and online harassment.

00:17:15.443 --> 00:17:20.874
Why? Because they all have
humiliation at their cores.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:27.503
This behavior is a symptom
of the culture we've created.

00:17:27.527 --> 00:17:28.843
Just think about it.

00:17:30.993 --> 00:17:34.034
Changing behavior begins
with evolving beliefs.

00:17:34.772 --> 00:17:37.943
We've seen that to be true
with racism, homophobia

00:17:37.967 --> 00:17:39.838
and plenty of other biases,

00:17:39.862 --> 00:17:41.633
today and in the past.

00:17:42.695 --> 00:17:45.719
As we've changed beliefs
about same-sex marriage,

00:17:45.743 --> 00:17:49.108
more people have been offered
equal freedoms.

00:17:49.978 --> 00:17:52.764
When we began valuing sustainability,

00:17:52.788 --> 00:17:54.827
more people began to recycle.

00:17:55.434 --> 00:17:58.932
So as far as our culture
of humiliation goes,

00:17:58.956 --> 00:18:01.603
what we need is a cultural revolution.

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:06.250
Public shaming
as a blood sport has to stop,

00:18:06.274 --> 00:18:10.339
and it's time for an intervention
on the internet and in our culture.

00:18:11.202 --> 00:18:13.642
The shift begins with something simple,

00:18:13.666 --> 00:18:15.010
but it's not easy.

00:18:15.985 --> 00:18:20.443
We need to return to a long-held
value of compassion,

00:18:20.467 --> 00:18:22.420
compassion and empathy.

00:18:23.071 --> 00:18:25.790
Online, we've got a compassion deficit,

00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:27.603
an empathy crisis.

00:18:29.413 --> 00:18:32.779
Researcher Brené Brown said, and I quote,

00:18:32.803 --> 00:18:35.329
"Shame can't survive empathy."

00:18:36.305 --> 00:18:40.669
Shame cannot survive empathy.

00:18:42.515 --> 00:18:45.308
I've seen some very dark days in my life.

00:18:46.221 --> 00:18:52.089
It was the compassion and empathy
from my family, friends, professionals

00:18:53.002 --> 00:18:54.742
and sometimes even strangers

00:18:54.766 --> 00:18:56.305
that saved me.

00:18:57.345 --> 00:19:00.536
Even empathy from one person
can make a difference.

00:19:02.369 --> 00:19:04.733
The theory of minority influence,

00:19:04.757 --> 00:19:08.171
proposed by social psychologist
Serge Moscovici,

00:19:08.195 --> 00:19:10.801
says that even in small numbers,

00:19:10.825 --> 00:19:13.001
when there's consistency over time,

00:19:13.025 --> 00:19:14.575
change can happen.

00:19:15.794 --> 00:19:19.037
In the online world,
we can foster minority influence

00:19:19.061 --> 00:19:20.849
by becoming upstanders.

00:19:21.353 --> 00:19:25.150
To become an upstander means
instead of bystander apathy,

00:19:25.174 --> 00:19:29.764
we can post a positive comment for someone
or report a bullying situation.

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:34.461
Trust me, compassionate comments
help abate the negativity.

00:19:35.202 --> 00:19:39.073
We can also counteract the culture
by supporting organizations

00:19:39.097 --> 00:19:41.174
that deal with these kinds of issues,

00:19:41.198 --> 00:19:43.982
like the Tyler Clementi
Foundation in the US;

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:47.413
in the UK, there's Anti-Bullying Pro;

00:19:47.437 --> 00:19:50.099
and in Australia, there's PROJECT ROCKIT.

00:19:52.206 --> 00:19:57.532
We talk a lot about our right
to freedom of expression.

00:19:58.333 --> 00:20:01.410
But we need to talk more
about our responsibility

00:20:01.434 --> 00:20:03.186
to freedom of expression.

00:20:04.051 --> 00:20:06.296
We all want to be heard,

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:11.080
but let's acknowledge the difference
between speaking up with intention

00:20:11.104 --> 00:20:13.856
and speaking up for attention.

00:20:15.493 --> 00:20:18.478
The internet is
the superhighway for the id.

00:20:19.597 --> 00:20:24.255
But online, showing empathy
to others benefits us all

00:20:24.279 --> 00:20:27.181
and helps create a safer and better world.

00:20:27.905 --> 00:20:30.957
We need to communicate
online with compassion,

00:20:30.981 --> 00:20:33.311
consume news with compassion

00:20:33.335 --> 00:20:35.409
and click with compassion.

00:20:36.114 --> 00:20:40.261
Just imagine walking a mile
in someone else's headline.

00:20:43.261 --> 00:20:46.246
I'd like to end on a personal note.

00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:49.365
In the past nine months,

00:20:49.389 --> 00:20:52.762
the question I've been
asked the most is "Why?"

00:20:52.786 --> 00:20:53.946
Why now?

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.524
Why was I sticking my head
above the parapet?

00:20:57.193 --> 00:20:59.806
You can read between the lines
in those questions,

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.587
and the answer has nothing
to do with politics.

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:08.306
The top-note answer was and is
"Because it's time."

00:21:09.166 --> 00:21:12.007
Time to stop tiptoeing around my past,

00:21:12.031 --> 00:21:15.021
time to stop living a life of opprobrium

00:21:15.045 --> 00:21:17.430
and time to take back my narrative.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:22.210
It's also not just about saving myself.

00:21:23.003 --> 00:21:26.649
Anyone who is suffering from shame
and public humiliation

00:21:26.673 --> 00:21:28.446
needs to know one thing:

00:21:29.446 --> 00:21:31.169
You can survive it.

00:21:32.016 --> 00:21:33.416
I know it's hard.

00:21:34.572 --> 00:21:38.085
It may not be painless, quick or easy,

00:21:38.109 --> 00:21:42.041
but you can insist
on a different ending to your story.

00:21:42.942 --> 00:21:44.980
Have compassion for yourself.

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.542
We all deserve compassion

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:54.751
and to live both online and off
in a more compassionate world.

00:21:55.684 --> 00:21:57.181
Thank you for listening.

00:21:57.205 --> 00:22:04.077
(Applause and cheers)
