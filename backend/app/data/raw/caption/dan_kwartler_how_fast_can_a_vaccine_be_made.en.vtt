00:00:06.674 --> 00:00:08.534
When a new pathogen emerges,

00:00:08.534 --> 00:00:12.204
our bodies and healthcare systems
are left vulnerable.

00:00:12.204 --> 00:00:16.144
In times like these,
there’s an urgent need for a vaccine

00:00:16.144 --> 00:00:19.492
to create widespread immunity
with minimal loss of life.

00:00:19.492 --> 00:00:23.962
So how quickly can we develop vaccines
when we need them most?

00:00:23.962 --> 00:00:27.728
Vaccine development can generally 
be split into three phases.

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:32.071
In exploratory research, scientists 
experiment with different approaches

00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:35.371
to find safe and replicable 
vaccine designs.

00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:39.211
Once these are vetted in the lab, 
they enter clinical testing,

00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:44.291
where vaccines are evaluated 
for safety, efficacy, and side effects

00:00:44.291 --> 00:00:47.116
across a variety of populations.

00:00:47.116 --> 00:00:49.556
Finally, there’s manufacturing,

00:00:49.556 --> 00:00:53.787
where vaccines are produced 
and distributed for public use.

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:59.287
Under regular circumstances, this process
takes an average of 15 to 20 years.

00:00:59.287 --> 00:01:03.287
But during a pandemic, 
researchers employ numerous strategies

00:01:03.287 --> 00:01:06.027
to move through each stage 
as quickly as possible.

00:01:06.027 --> 00:01:09.627
Exploratory research is perhaps 
the most flexible.

00:01:09.627 --> 00:01:12.617
The goal of this stage 
is to find a safe way

00:01:12.617 --> 00:01:16.932
to introduce our immune system 
to the virus or bacteria.

00:01:16.932 --> 00:01:21.392
This gives our body the information
it needs to create antibodies

00:01:21.392 --> 00:01:24.062
capable of fighting a real infection.

00:01:24.062 --> 00:01:27.762
There are many ways to safely trigger
this immune response,

00:01:27.762 --> 00:01:33.192
but generally, the most effective 
designs are also the slowest to produce.

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:37.342
Traditional attenuated vaccines 
create long lasting resilience.

00:01:37.342 --> 00:01:39.912
But they rely on weakened viral strains

00:01:39.912 --> 00:01:44.553
that must be cultivated in non-human
tissue over long periods of time.

00:01:44.553 --> 00:01:47.994
Inactivated vaccines take 
a much faster approach,

00:01:47.994 --> 00:01:53.744
directly applying heat, acid, or radiation
to weaken the pathogen.

00:01:53.744 --> 00:01:58.216
Sub-unit vaccines, that inject 
harmless fragments of viral proteins,

00:01:58.216 --> 00:02:00.466
can also be created quickly.

00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:05.001
But these faster techniques produce
less robust resilience.

00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:08.121
These are just three 
of many vaccine designs,

00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:10.651
each with their own pros and cons.

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:13.631
No single approach is guaranteed to work,

00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:16.891
and all of them require 
time-consuming research.

00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:20.151
So the best way to speed things up 
is for many labs

00:02:20.151 --> 00:02:23.381
to work on different models 
simultaneously.

00:02:23.381 --> 00:02:25.681
This race-to-the-finish strategy

00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:29.938
produced the first testable 
Zika vaccine in 7 months,

00:02:29.938 --> 00:02:35.088
and the first testable COVID-19 vaccine
in just 42 days.

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:39.088
Being testable doesn’t mean 
these vaccines will be successful.

00:02:39.088 --> 00:02:42.208
But models that are deemed safe 
and easily replicable

00:02:42.208 --> 00:02:47.387
can move into clinical testing while other
labs continue exploring alternatives.

00:02:47.387 --> 00:02:51.896
Whether a testable vaccine is produced
in four months or four years,

00:02:51.896 --> 00:02:56.932
the next stage is often the longest and 
most unpredictable stage of development.

00:02:56.932 --> 00:03:02.184
Clinical testing consists of three phases,
each containing multiple trials.

00:03:02.184 --> 00:03:07.084
Phase I trials focus on the intensity 
of the triggered immune response,

00:03:07.084 --> 00:03:10.924
and try to establish that the vaccine 
is safe and effective.

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:15.229
Phase II trials focus on determining 
the right dosage and delivery schedule

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:17.449
across a wider population.

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:19.939
And Phase III trials determine safety

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.519
across the vaccine’s primary 
use population,

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.837
while also identifying rare side effects
and negative reactions.

00:03:27.837 --> 00:03:31.987
Given the number of variables 
and the focus on long-term safety,

00:03:31.987 --> 00:03:35.987
it’s incredibly difficult to speed up 
clinical testing.

00:03:35.987 --> 00:03:39.397
In extreme circumstances, 
researchers run multiple trials

00:03:39.397 --> 00:03:41.777
within one phase at the same time.

00:03:41.777 --> 00:03:46.067
But they still need to meet 
strict safety criteria before moving on.

00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:49.917
Occasionally, labs can expedite 
this process by leveraging

00:03:49.917 --> 00:03:52.577
previously approved treatments.

00:03:52.577 --> 00:03:58.763
In 2009, researchers adapted 
the seasonal flu vaccine to treat H1N1—

00:03:58.763 --> 00:04:03.776
producing a widely available vaccine
in just six months.

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:08.267
However, this technique only works
when dealing with familiar pathogens

00:04:08.267 --> 00:04:11.897
that have well-established 
vaccine designs.

00:04:11.897 --> 00:04:16.560
After a successful Phase III trial, 
a national regulatory authority

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.102
reviews the results and approves 
safe vaccines for manufacturing.

00:04:21.102 --> 00:04:25.782
Every vaccine has a unique blend 
of biological and chemical components

00:04:25.782 --> 00:04:29.492
that require a specialized pipeline 
to produce.

00:04:29.492 --> 00:04:32.392
To start production as soon 
as the vaccine is approved,

00:04:32.392 --> 00:04:37.754
manufacturing plans must be designed
in parallel to research and testing.

00:04:37.754 --> 00:04:42.086
This requires constant coordination
between labs and manufacturers,

00:04:42.086 --> 00:04:46.905
as well as the resources to adapt
to sudden changes in vaccine design—

00:04:46.905 --> 00:04:50.605
even if that means scrapping
months of work.

00:04:50.605 --> 00:04:54.435
Over time, advances in exploratory
research and manufacturing

00:04:54.435 --> 00:04:56.835
should make this process faster.

00:04:56.835 --> 00:04:59.445
Preliminary studies suggest 
that future researchers

00:04:59.445 --> 00:05:03.335
may be able to swap genetic material
from different viruses

00:05:03.335 --> 00:05:06.105
into the same vaccine design.

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:11.159
These DNA and mRNA based vaccines
could dramatically expedite

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:13.819
all three stages of vaccine production.

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:15.949
But until such breakthroughs arrive,

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:19.943
our best strategy is for labs 
around the world to cooperate

00:05:19.943 --> 00:05:22.743
and work in parallel 
on different approaches.

00:05:22.743 --> 00:05:24.983
By sharing knowledge and resources,

00:05:24.983 --> 00:05:28.785
scientists can divide and conquer 
any pathogen.
