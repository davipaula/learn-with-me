00:00:07.101 --> 00:00:12.568
Arriving home after a long day, you settle
in for a quiet evening alone.

00:00:12.568 --> 00:00:17.289
But instead of the sound of silence, 
you hear a constant ringing—

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.449
even though there’s nothing 
making any noise.

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.680
What you’re experiencing 
is called tinnitus,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.754
the perception of a noise like ringing, 
buzzing, hissing or clicking

00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:32.754
that occurs without any external source 
of sound.

00:00:32.754 --> 00:00:36.880
Tinnitus has been bothering humanity 
since Ancient Babylon,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.355
plaguing everyone from Leonardo da Vinci 
to Charles Darwin.

00:00:41.355 --> 00:00:44.465
Today, roughly one in seven people 
worldwide

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:47.470
experiences this auditory sensation.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.080
So where does this persistent sound 
come from?

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.496
When you normally hear something, 
sound waves hit various areas of your ear,

00:00:56.496 --> 00:01:02.114
creating vibrations that displace fluid 
inside the cochlea.

00:01:02.114 --> 00:01:04.264
If the vibrations are large enough,

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:07.797
they elicit a chemical response 
that transforms them

00:01:07.797 --> 00:01:10.427
into bioelectrical signals.

00:01:10.427 --> 00:01:15.514
These nerve impulses are then relayed 
through the hearing pathway to the brain,

00:01:15.514 --> 00:01:18.824
where they result 
in the sounds we perceive.

00:01:18.824 --> 00:01:22.467
However, in the vast majority 
of tinnitus cases,

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:25.867
the nerve signals that produce 
these mysterious sounds

00:01:25.867 --> 00:01:28.767
don’t travel through your ear at all.

00:01:28.767 --> 00:01:34.498
Instead, they’re generated internally, 
by your own central nervous system.

00:01:34.498 --> 00:01:38.428
Under usual circumstances, 
these self-produced signals

00:01:38.428 --> 00:01:40.899
are an essential part of hearing.

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.477
All mammals demonstrate 
on-going neural activity

00:01:44.477 --> 00:01:46.607
throughout their hearing pathways.

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:48.492
When there are no sounds present,

00:01:48.492 --> 00:01:53.332
this activity is at a baseline 
that establishes your neural code

00:01:53.332 --> 00:01:54.972
for silence.

00:01:54.972 --> 00:01:58.427
When a sound does appear, 
this activity changes,

00:01:58.427 --> 00:02:03.070
allowing the brain to distinguish 
between silence and sound.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.580
But the auditory system’s health 
can affect this background signal.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.855
Loud noises, diseases, toxins, 
and even natural aging

00:02:13.855 --> 00:02:16.425
can damage your cochlear cells.

00:02:16.425 --> 00:02:19.368
Some of these may heal 
in a matter of hours.

00:02:19.368 --> 00:02:25.076
However, if enough cells die, 
either over time or all at once,

00:02:25.076 --> 00:02:29.086
the auditory system becomes 
less sensitive.

00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:32.178
With fewer cochlear cells 
relaying information,

00:02:32.178 --> 00:02:35.748
incoming sounds generate 
weaker nerve signals.

00:02:35.748 --> 00:02:39.724
And many environmental sounds 
can be lost completely.

00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:45.641
To compensate, your brain devotes more 
energy to monitoring the hearing pathway.

00:02:45.641 --> 00:02:48.991
Just like you might adjust 
the knobs of a radio,

00:02:48.991 --> 00:02:53.060
the brain modifies neural activity 
while also tweaking the tuning knob

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.284
to get a clearer signal.

00:02:56.284 --> 00:03:00.973
Increasing this background neural activity
is intended to help you process

00:03:00.973 --> 00:03:04.073
weak auditory inputs.

00:03:04.073 --> 00:03:07.630
But it can also modify 
your baseline for silence—

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.608
such that a lack of sound 
no longer sounds silent at all.

00:03:12.608 --> 00:03:15.468
This is called subjective tinnitus,

00:03:15.468 --> 00:03:19.330
and it accounts for the vast majority 
of tinnitus cases.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.370
Subjective tinnitus 
is a symptom associated with

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.200
practically every known ear disorder,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.180
but it isn’t necessarily a bad thing.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.373
While its appearance can be surprising,

00:03:30.373 --> 00:03:34.933
subjective tinnitus has no inherently 
negative consequences.

00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:39.557
But for some, tinnitus episodes 
can trigger traumatic memories

00:03:39.557 --> 00:03:42.277
or otherwise distressing feelings,

00:03:42.277 --> 00:03:45.483
which increase the sound’s intrusiveness.

00:03:45.483 --> 00:03:50.688
This psychological loop often leads 
to what’s known as “bothersome tinnitus,"

00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:55.714
a condition that can exacerbate 
the symptoms of PTSD, insomnia,

00:03:55.714 --> 00:03:58.324
anxiety, and depression.

00:03:58.324 --> 00:04:01.293
There’s no known cure 
for subjective tinnitus.

00:04:01.293 --> 00:04:04.033
So the most important thing 
doctors can do

00:04:04.033 --> 00:04:07.473
is help people understand 
this auditory event,

00:04:07.473 --> 00:04:12.857
and develop neutral associations 
with these often-distressing sounds.

00:04:12.857 --> 00:04:19.167
For example, sound therapy uses noises 
like rain, birdsong, or music

00:04:19.167 --> 00:04:22.547
to mask tinnitus and reduce stress.

00:04:22.547 --> 00:04:28.794
One form, called informational masking, 
uses soothing, complex auditory signals

00:04:28.794 --> 00:04:32.094
that distract the brain 
from the tinnitus sound.

00:04:32.094 --> 00:04:34.760
Another, called energetic masking,

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.730
uses sounds with the same frequency 
as the patient’s tinnitus

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.560
to occupy the neurons that would 
otherwise deliver the tinnitus signal.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.907
Practiced alongside counseling,

00:04:45.907 --> 00:04:49.132
these interventions allow 
people to re-evaluate

00:04:49.132 --> 00:04:52.392
their relationship with tinnitus.

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:56.362
Losing the sound of silence 
can be troubling to say the least.

00:04:56.362 --> 00:05:01.399
Tinnitus reveals that your brain is 
constantly analyzing the world around you,

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:05.479
even as it fails to filter 
its own internal noise.

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.141
In a sense, experiencing tinnitus

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:11.822
is like eavesdropping 
on your brain talking to itself—

00:05:11.822 --> 00:05:14.868
though it may not be a conversation 
you want to hear.
