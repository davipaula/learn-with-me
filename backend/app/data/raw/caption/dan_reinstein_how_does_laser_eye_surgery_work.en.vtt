00:00:06.704 --> 00:00:12.332
In 1948, Spanish ophthalmologist 
Jose Ignacio Barraquer Moner

00:00:12.332 --> 00:00:14.072
was fed up with glasses.

00:00:14.072 --> 00:00:18.752
He wanted a solution for blurry 
vision that fixed the eye itself,

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:21.642
without relying on external aids.

00:00:21.642 --> 00:00:26.155
But the surgery he eventually devised 
was not for the faint of heart.

00:00:26.155 --> 00:00:30.808
Barraquer began by slicing off the front
of a patient’s cornea

00:00:30.808 --> 00:00:34.178
and dunking it in liquid nitrogen.

00:00:34.178 --> 00:00:38.108
Using a miniature lathe, he ground the 
frozen cornea

00:00:38.108 --> 00:00:42.516
into the precise shape necessary to focus
the patient’s vision.

00:00:42.516 --> 00:00:46.526
Then he thawed the disc, and sewed 
it back on.

00:00:46.526 --> 00:00:50.196
Barraquer called this procedure 
keratomileusis,

00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:53.776
from the Greek words for “carving” 
and “cornea.”

00:00:53.776 --> 00:00:59.330
And though it might sound grisly, 
his technique produced reliable results.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.420
So how did Barraquer’s surgery work?

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.978
Keratomileusis corrects what are called 
refractive errors:

00:01:07.978 --> 00:01:12.272
imperfections in the way the eye focuses 
incoming light.

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:16.142
Ideally, the cornea and lens work 
together to focus light

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:18.132
on the surface of the retina,

00:01:18.132 --> 00:01:23.570
but several kinds of refractive errors 
can impair this delicate system.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.650
In people with myopia, 
or short-sightedness,

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.320
a steep cornea focuses light just short 
of the retina.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.090
Those with hyperopia, or far-sightedness, 
have the opposite problem:

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.730
light is focused too far 
beyond the retina.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.354
And in people with astigmatism, 
the cornea has two different curvatures

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:49.008
which focus light at two distances and 
produce blurry vision.

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:53.674
Even those with perfect vision will 
eventually suffer from presbyopia,

00:01:53.674 --> 00:01:55.394
or “aging eyes.”

00:01:55.394 --> 00:02:00.767
As the proteins in the lens age, they 
slowly increase its size.

00:02:00.767 --> 00:02:04.207
By an adult’s mid-40’s, the lens is too
large

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:08.127
to easily change shape and shift focus.

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:14.365
Glasses and contact lenses bend light 
to compensate for these refractive errors.

00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:17.125
But, as Barraquer’s procedure shows,

00:02:17.125 --> 00:02:21.312
we can also alter the shape 
of the cornea itself;

00:02:21.312 --> 00:02:24.462
moving the focal point backwards, 
forwards,

00:02:24.462 --> 00:02:27.932
or pulling a divided image together.

00:02:27.932 --> 00:02:31.842
And thankfully, modern eye surgeons can 
sculpt the cornea

00:02:31.842 --> 00:02:35.172
with far less invasive tools.

00:02:35.172 --> 00:02:40.499
In corrective laser eye surgery, surgeons 
rely on excimer lasers.

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:46.443
These tools are accurate enough to etch 
words into a human hair.

00:02:46.443 --> 00:02:49.943
To safely accomplish these 
ultra-fine incisions,

00:02:49.943 --> 00:02:53.083
they use a technique called photoablation.

00:02:53.083 --> 00:02:57.265
This allows the laser to essentially 
evaporate organic tissue

00:02:57.265 --> 00:03:00.725
without overheating 
surrounding eye tissue.

00:03:00.725 --> 00:03:04.005
So how does laser eye surgery 
actually work?

00:03:04.005 --> 00:03:08.759
The first step is to separate a thin layer
from the front of the cornea.

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:14.007
This can be done with either a flat, 
wide blade, or a femto-second laser

00:03:14.007 --> 00:03:17.207
that produces millions of tiny plasma 
bubbles

00:03:17.207 --> 00:03:21.573
to create a plane beneath 
the corneal surface.

00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:25.820
Surgeons then lift the flap to expose the 
inside of the cornea.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.230
Guided by the refractive error and the 
shape of the cornea,

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.392
the excimer laser robotically sculpts the
exposed corneal bed

00:03:33.392 --> 00:03:34.952
into the correct shape.

00:03:34.952 --> 00:03:40.641
This process usually takes less than 30 
seconds for each eye.

00:03:40.641 --> 00:03:42.451
Finally, the flap is closed,

00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:46.341
and its edges reseal themselves 
in just a few hours.

00:03:46.341 --> 00:03:49.951
Because the lasering is done on 
the eyeball itself,

00:03:49.951 --> 00:03:53.357
it’s described as “in situ,” or “on site.”

00:03:53.357 --> 00:03:57.543
Its complete name is “laser in-situ 
keratomileusis” –

00:03:57.543 --> 00:04:00.553
but you probably know it as LASIK.

00:04:00.553 --> 00:04:05.291
Essentially, this technique carves a 
patient’s contact lens prescription

00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:07.001
onto their cornea.

00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:08.611
Like any surgical procedure,

00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:10.691
LASIK comes with certain risks.

00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:15.730
Some patients experience slightly blurred
vision that can’t be corrected by glasses.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.540
But the technique is currently about 
as likely to damage your eyes

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.946
as wearing daily disposable contact 
lenses for one year.

00:04:23.946 --> 00:04:28.245
Today, a technique called SMILE enables 
surgeons to sculpt the cornea

00:04:28.245 --> 00:04:30.715
through even smaller incisions –

00:04:30.715 --> 00:04:32.695
further reducing recovery time.

00:04:32.695 --> 00:04:36.830
And lasers aren’t just correcting the 
three types of refractive errors –

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.460
this technology can also 
restore aging eyes.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.220
In a technique called Laser 
Blended Vision,

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.452
surgeons adjust one eye to be slightly 
better at distance vision

00:04:47.452 --> 00:04:50.742
and the other to be better 
at close range vision.

00:04:50.742 --> 00:04:53.412
The difference between the two eyes is 
small enough

00:04:53.412 --> 00:04:56.072
that most patients can merge their vision,

00:04:56.072 --> 00:05:00.291
allowing both eyes to work 
together at all distances.

00:05:00.291 --> 00:05:04.685
Advances in laser technology continue 
to make vision correction surgery

00:05:04.685 --> 00:05:07.165
more effective and accessible.

00:05:07.165 --> 00:05:10.905
One day soon, Barraquer’s vision of a 
world without glasses

00:05:10.905 --> 00:05:12.695
may finally come true.
