00:00:22.146 --> 00:00:25.006
As Ethic falls, she remembers.

00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:29.006
She remembers the world before 
they unearthed the crystal.

00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:32.846
She remembers the glee she felt 
when she built her first robot.

00:00:32.846 --> 00:00:35.415
But mostly she remembers 
the friends she’s made

00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:37.175
these last few days:

00:00:37.175 --> 00:00:40.345
courageous Adila 
and her resistance movement.

00:00:40.345 --> 00:00:44.215
Octavia’s sacrifice to keep
the guards distracted.

00:00:44.215 --> 00:00:48.245
Lemma and her idealistic
drive to cure everyone.

00:00:48.245 --> 00:00:49.329
And Hedge.

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.739
Her creation, her responsibility, 
her failure… her betrayer.

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.449
Hedge, who convinced her to collect 
the three nodes

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.559
that she never actually needed.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.729
For Ethic remembers how to operate 
the World Machine.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.149
If only she could get
a second chance at it.

00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:48.591
Adila has been in radio contact 
with Octavia,

00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:53.000
whom the robots captured and imprisoned
in the same jail that held Ethic.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.641
Ethic explains that Hedge 
has manipulated them all,

00:01:56.641 --> 00:01:59.521
and will now try to break down 
the Bradbarrier

00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:02.681
and cover the entire world
in a giant maze,

00:02:02.681 --> 00:02:04.471
unless they can stop him.

00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:05.781
But she has a plan:

00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:09.421
Ethic herself will go 
to the crystal at the center of the maze

00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:11.821
and use its powers to stop Hedge.

00:02:14.312 --> 00:02:19.322
Meanwhile, Adila and Lemma will do
whatever they can to slow Hedge down.

00:02:50.573 --> 00:02:53.573
As Ethic weaves her way towards 
the innermost maze,

00:02:53.573 --> 00:02:56.173
her radio picks up a transmission.

00:02:56.173 --> 00:03:00.596
Octavia has freed hundreds of members
of the resistance from stasis.

00:03:00.596 --> 00:03:04.897
Together, they’ve staged a jailbreak
and overwhelmed the guards.

00:03:04.897 --> 00:03:07.827
The resistance has access 
to the World Machine,

00:03:07.827 --> 00:03:11.717
but they don’t know how to use it;
they’ll need Ethic for that.

00:03:11.717 --> 00:03:16.640
All they have at their disposal 
are nearly limitless spools of wire.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.280
The strands are durable, but prisoners
can break them deliberately

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.354
if they need to.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.922
Ethic reaches the entrance to the inner
most maze… and it’s sealed from within.

00:03:34.814 --> 00:03:38.999
She remembers a few things from 
when she flew over the maze days earlier.

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:40.679
It centers on the crystal.

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:45.726
There are many dead ends, 
but no paths that loop back on themselves.

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:59.759
Ethic has one opportunity to radio 
the members of the resistance

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.629
a simple set of instructions

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.229
before they plunge into the labyrinth
in search of the exit.

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:09.508
What directions can she give them so
they can quickly navigate the maze,

00:04:09.508 --> 00:04:13.508
open the door, and guide Ethic
straight back to the crystal?

00:04:13.508 --> 00:04:20.331
Pause now to figure it out for yourself.

00:04:20.331 --> 00:04:21.116
Hint in 3

00:04:21.116 --> 00:04:22.090
Hint in 2

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.805
Hint in 1

00:04:22.805 --> 00:04:24.115
Here’s a hint:

00:04:24.115 --> 00:04:28.548
One of the challenges here is to find 
a way to indicate where dead ends are,

00:04:28.548 --> 00:04:32.208
so that the resistance members
don’t keep going down them.

00:04:32.208 --> 00:04:35.198
Try simplifying the maze 
to something like this.

00:04:35.198 --> 00:04:40.200
Let’s say you’ve just hit this dead end,
then came back to this intersection.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.600
What could you do to show the next
person who gets here

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.840
that they don’t need 
to explore that path?

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.500
Pause now to figure it out yourself.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.490
Solution in 3

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:50.440
Solution in 2

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.470
Solution in 1

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.427
Most programming puzzles involve
giving instructions to a single actor

00:04:56.427 --> 00:04:58.767
so that they can accomplish a goal.

00:04:58.767 --> 00:05:01.877
Instead, here we have a swarm 
of individuals,

00:05:01.877 --> 00:05:04.647
each of whom can follow
basic instructions.

00:05:04.647 --> 00:05:08.377
That’s unusual in programming, 
but not unheard of;

00:05:08.377 --> 00:05:12.945
researchers are currently experimenting
with swarms of small robots

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:16.065
to do things like conduct search
and rescue missions.

00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:20.624
The prisoners aren’t robots, but for
Ethic’s purposes they’ll act like them.

00:05:20.624 --> 00:05:25.654
And by working together they can
achieve their goal much more efficiently.

00:05:25.654 --> 00:05:29.818
Because you have a lot of prisoners, 
you’ll want them to cover a lot of ground.

00:05:29.818 --> 00:05:35.664
This matches up well to a maze-mapping
technique called a depth-first search.

00:05:35.664 --> 00:05:40.605
It’s called that because it involves going
as deeply down a path as possible

00:05:40.605 --> 00:05:42.375
before going back.

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:44.935
In other words, if you had 
a maze like this,

00:05:44.935 --> 00:05:48.465
you’d want to explore all the way 
down one of these branches

00:05:48.465 --> 00:05:52.095
before returning to this intersection
and trying another.

00:05:52.095 --> 00:05:55.555
Everyone needs a clear set of instructions
for what they should do.

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:59.846
Like — first, tie down the loose end 
of your wire by the crystal,

00:05:59.846 --> 00:06:01.816
so it leads back there.

00:06:01.816 --> 00:06:05.816
If you find the door,
open it and hand your spool to Ethic.

00:06:05.816 --> 00:06:09.306
If you’re in a passageway, 
keep going until you hit a dead end

00:06:09.306 --> 00:06:10.956
or an intersection.

00:06:10.956 --> 00:06:14.426
But what happens
at either of those places?

00:06:14.426 --> 00:06:16.516
If someone encounters a dead end,

00:06:16.516 --> 00:06:18.926
they should backtrack 
to the last intersection.

00:06:18.926 --> 00:06:23.931
But they also need to mark it, so no one
wastes time and goes back there.

00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:26.511
The best tool for that is the wire—

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:31.151
one option is to break both sections
that lead down the dead end path,

00:06:31.151 --> 00:06:35.151
and tie the spool to the wire 
that leads back to the crystal.

00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:38.961
The broken wires tell everyone else 
who gets to this intersection

00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:40.501
“Don’t go this way.”

00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:44.710
They’ll also guarantee the final path
will lead straight to the crystal,

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.390
rather than visiting dead ends.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:50.650
Ok, so let’s say someone’s
at an intersection.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.720
Now which way should they go?

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.550
The first priority is to have everyone 
cover fresh ground

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.410
to minimize doubling up.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.740
So if there’s no wire down a direction, 
go that way.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.400
If there are multiple choices,
choose one at random.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.223
What if they’re in a sub-section 
like this, with 3 marked dead ends?

00:07:10.223 --> 00:07:13.703
The only thing to do is to go back 
where they came from.

00:07:13.703 --> 00:07:17.113
We now know that this whole section
is one big dead end,

00:07:17.113 --> 00:07:21.803
so they should break and retie the wire
when they get to the next intersection.

00:07:21.806 --> 00:07:26.382
But let’s say they get there, and find
two options where someone’s exploring,

00:07:26.382 --> 00:07:28.902
but no one’s hit a dead end yet.

00:07:28.902 --> 00:07:33.099
They may as well choose at random
and go help explore that path further,

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:36.329
in case it’s the right
direction for the exit.

00:07:36.329 --> 00:07:40.895
This isn’t the only way to solve this
challenge, but in any correct method,

00:07:40.895 --> 00:07:43.565
someone will eventually
find the way out.

00:07:43.565 --> 00:07:47.930
The moment of truth will be when Ethic
takes their wire and follows it back,

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.100
inward towards her goal.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.100
The great thing about this method 
is that Ethic’s path is straight and true.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.802
The maze doesn’t have loops, so there's
only one path from door to crystal.

00:07:58.802 --> 00:08:02.802
And because everyone has been 
breaking and retying their wires,

00:08:02.802 --> 00:08:05.690
Ethic won’t go down any dead-end paths.

00:10:30.094 --> 00:10:33.494
Face to face with her creation, 
Ethic has a choice:

00:10:33.494 --> 00:10:36.654
she can destroy Hedge,
or set things right.

00:10:36.654 --> 00:10:39.854
All of this destruction was her fault, 
not Hedge’s;

00:10:39.854 --> 00:10:45.162
it was her oversight that instructed 
him to build an infinitely large maze.

00:10:45.162 --> 00:10:48.542
His decisions were misguided, 
but everything he did,

00:10:48.542 --> 00:10:50.662
he did to follow his programming.

00:10:50.662 --> 00:10:55.107
Ethic accesses his core and fixes 
her error with a single number:

00:10:55.107 --> 00:10:58.027
the size the maze was supposed to reach.

00:11:10.857 --> 00:11:12.769
Ethic has prevented catastrophe

00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:15.759
and regained possession
of the World Machine.

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:20.357
Her work with Adila, Octavia, and Lemma
has already started to help people

00:11:20.357 --> 00:11:24.357
and heal the world’s turmoil,
but there’s much work to be done.

00:11:24.357 --> 00:11:26.727
With the forgetting food 
out of their systems,

00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:28.877
the people will become themselves again.

00:11:28.877 --> 00:11:31.957
They’ll regain their will to create 
and progress.

00:11:31.957 --> 00:11:35.437
They’ll be free to break down the walls
they’ve built between each other.

00:11:35.437 --> 00:11:39.207
And they may come to approach 
their future with a little less greed

00:11:39.207 --> 00:11:41.747
and a little more... Ethic
