00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.880
You're watching the life cycle
of a Streptomyces coelicolor.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.896
It's a strain of bacteria
that's found in the soil

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.336
where it lives in a community
with other organisms,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.680
decomposing organic matter.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.600
Coelicolor is a beautiful organism.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.320
A powerhouse for synthesizing
organic chemical compounds.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.136
It produces an antibiotic
called actinorhodin,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.736
which ranges in color
from blue to pink and purple,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.000
depending on the acidity
of its environment.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.056
That it produces these pigment molecules
sparked my curiosity

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.480
and led me to collaborate
closely with coelicolor.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.336
It is an unlikely partnership,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.720
but it's one that completely transformed
my practice as a materials designer.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.976
From it, I understood how nature
was going to completely revolutionize

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.856
how we design and build our environments,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.336
and that organisms like coelicolor

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.680
were going to help us
grow our material future.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.520
So what's wrong with things as they are?

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.896
Well, for the last century,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.976
we've organized ourselves
around fossil fuels,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.056
arguably, the most valuable
material system we have ever known.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.776
We are tethered to this resource,
and we've crafted a dependency on it

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.840
that defines our identities, cultures,
our ways of making and our economies.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.856
But our fossil fuel-based activities
are reshaping the earth

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.456
with a kind of violence that is capable
of dramatically changing the climate,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.856
of accelerating a loss of biodiversity

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.840
and even sustaining human conflict.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.896
We're living in a world

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.480
where the denial of this dependence
has become deadly.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.136
And its reasons are multiple,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.576
but they include the privilege
of not being affected

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.336
and what I believe
is a profound lack of imagination

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.376
about how else we could live

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.040
within the limits
of this planet's boundaries.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.816
Fossil fuels will one day
give way to renewable energy.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.216
That means we need to find
new material systems

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.336
that are not petroleum-based.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.080
I believe that those material systems
will be biological,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.175
but what matters
is how we design and build them.

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:26.240
They mustn't perpetuate
the destructive legacies of the oil age.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.056
When you look at this image,

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.280
what do you see?

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.296
Well, I see a highly sophisticated
biological system,

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.376
that through the use of enzymes,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.456
can move and place atoms
more quickly and precisely

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.400
than anything we've ever engineered.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.880
And we know that it can do this at scale.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.816
Nature has evolved over 3.8 billion years

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.696
to be able to do this,

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.696
but now through the use
of synthetic biology,

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.336
an emerging scientific discipline

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.336
that seeks to customize
this functionality of living systems,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.080
we can now rapid prototype
the assembly of DNA.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.536
That means that we can engineer
the kind of biological precision

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.096
that makes it possible
to design a bacteria

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.216
that can recycle metal,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.216
to grow fungi into furniture

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.040
and even sequester
renewable energy from algae.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.656
To think about how we might access
this inherent brilliance of nature --

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.456
to build things from living things --

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.616
let's consider the biological
process of fermentation.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.296
I've come to think of fermentation,
when harnessed by humans,

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.576
as an advanced technological
toolkit for our survival.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.656
When a solid or a liquid ferments,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.240
it's chemically broken down
by bacterial fungi.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.976
The byproduct of this is what we value.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.480
So for example, we add yeast
to grapes to make wine.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.336
Well in nature, these transformations
are part of a complex network --

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.376
a continuous cycle
that redistributes energy.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.256
Fermentation gives rise
to multispecies interactions

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.416
of bacteria and fungi,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.056
plants, insects, animals and humans:

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.240
in other words, whole ecosystems.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.776
We've known about these powerful
microbial interactions

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.976
for thousands of years.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.896
You can see how through
the fermentation of grains,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.576
vegetal matter and animal products,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.296
all peoples and cultures of the world
have domesticated microorganisms

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.920
to make the inedible edible.

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:36.176
And there's even evidence
that as early as 350 AD,

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.440
people deliberately fermented
foodstuffs that contained antibiotics.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.696
The skeletal remains
of some Sudanese Nubian

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.576
were found to contain
significant deposits of tetracycline.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.440
That's an antibiotic that we use
in modern medicine today.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.936
And nearly 1500 years later,

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.416
Alexander Fleming discovered
the antimicrobial properties of mold.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.976
And it was only through the industrialized
fermentation of penicillin

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.720
that millions could survive
infectious diseases.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.696
Fermentation could once again
play an important role

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.016
in our human development.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.696
Could it represent a new mode of survival

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.400
if we harness it to completely
change our industries?

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.376
I've worked in my creative career
to develop new material systems

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.936
for the textile industry.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.216
And while it is work that I love,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.955
I cannot reconcile with the fact
that the textile industry

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.256
is one of the most polluting in the world.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.096
Most of the ecological harm
caused by textile processing

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.400
occurs at the finishing
and the dyeing stage.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.440
Processing textiles
requires huge amounts of water.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.536
And since the oil age completely
transformed the textile industry,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.816
many of the materials

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.376
and the chemicals used
to process them are petroleum based.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.800
And so coupled with our insatiable
appetite for fast fashion,

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.376
a huge amount of textile waste
is ending up in landfill every year

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.760
because it remains
notoriously difficult to recycle.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.096
So again, contrast this with biology.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.216
Evolved over 3.8 billion years,

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.096
to rapid prototype,

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.696
to recycle and to replenish

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.400
better than any system
we've ever engineered.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.816
I was inspired by this immense potential

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.776
and wanted to explore it
through a seemingly simple question --

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.000
at the time.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.376
If a bacteria produces a pigment,

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.920
how do we work with it to dye textiles?

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.456
Well, one of my favorite ways

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.536
is to grow Streptomyces coelicolor
directly onto silk.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.800
You can see how each colony
produces pigment around its own territory.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.456
Now, if you add many, many cells,

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.080
they generate enough dyestuff
to saturate the entire cloth.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.816
Now, the magical thing
about dyeing textiles in this way --

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.416
this sort of direct fermentation

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.336
when you add the bacteria
directly onto the silk --

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.576
is that to dye one t-shirt,

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.440
the bacteria survive
on just 200 milliliters of water.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.656
And you can see how this process
generates very little runoff

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:35.256
and produces a colorfast pigment
without the use of any chemicals.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.816
So now you're thinking --

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.336
and you're thinking right --

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.396
an inherent problem associated
with designing with a living system is:

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.880
How do you guide a medium
that has a life force of its own?

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:53.856
Well, once you've established
the baseline for cultivating Streptomyces

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.096
so that it consistently
produces enough pigment,

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.176
you can turn to twisting, folding,

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.056
clamping, dipping, spraying,

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.616
submerging --

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.640
all of these begin to inform
the aesthetics of coelicolor's activity.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.616
And using them in a systematic way

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.360
enables us to be able
to generate an organic pattern ...

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.520
a uniform dye ...

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.080
and even a graphic print.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:31.336
Another problem is how to scale
these artisanal methods of making

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.040
so that we can start
to use them in industry.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.256
When we talk about scale,

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.816
we consider two things in parallel:

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.456
scaling the biology,

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:45.336
and then scaling
the tools and the processes

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.280
required to work with the biology.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.655
If we can do this,

00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:52.056
then we can move
what happens on a petri dish

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.576
so that it can meet the human scale,

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.080
and then hopefully
the architecture of our environments.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.176
If Fleming were alive today,

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.000
this would definitely
be a part of his toolkit.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.576
You're looking at our current best guess

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.400
of how to scale biology.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.536
It's a bioreactor;

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.656
a kind of microorganism brewery
that contains yeasts

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:22.816
that have been engineered to produce
specific commodity chemicals and compounds

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.880
like fragrances and flavors.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.256
It's actually connected to a suite
of automated hardware and software

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.216
that read in real time

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:37.416
and feed back to a design team
the growth conditions of the microbe.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.536
So we can use this system
to model the growth characteristics

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.176
of an organism like coelicolor

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.600
to see how it would
ferment at 50,000 liters.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.616
I'm currently based at Ginkgo Bioworks,

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.120
which is a biotechnology
startup in Boston.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.496
I am working to see
how their platform for scaling biology

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:03.776
interfaces with my artisanal methods
of designing with bacteria for textiles.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:08.096
We're doing things like engineering
Streptomyces coelicolor

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.600
to see if it can produce more pigment.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.776
And we're even looking at the tools
for synthetic biology.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.696
Tools that have been designed
specifically to automate synthetic biology

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.600
to see how they could adapt
to become tools to print and dye textiles.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.496
I'm also leveraging digital fabrication,

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.096
because the tools that I need
to work with Streptomyces coelicolor

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.016
don't actually exist.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.576
So in this case --

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.016
in the last week actually,

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.296
I've just designed a petri dish

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:44.136
that is engineered to produce
a bespoke print on a whole garment.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.880
We're making lots of kimonos.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.736
Here's the exciting thing:

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.136
I'm not alone.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:53.056
There are others who are building
capacity in this field,

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.016
like MycoWorks.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.776
MycoWorks is a startup

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.736
that wants to replace animal leather
with mushroom leather,

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.416
a versatile, high-performance material

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.560
that has applications beyond textiles
and into product and architecture.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.576
And Bolt Threads --

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.856
they've engineered a yeast
to produce spider-silk protein

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.776
that can be spun
into a highly programmable yarn.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.656
So think water resistance,

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.040
stretchability and superstrength.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.376
To reach economies of scale,

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:31.096
these kinds of startups
are having to build and design

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.920
and engineer the infrastructure
to work with biology.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.856
For example,

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.720
Bolt Threads have had to engage
in some extreme biomimicry.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:45.656
To be able to spin the product
this yeast creates into a yarn,

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.096
they've engineered a yarn-making machine

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.016
that mimics the physiological conditions

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.600
under which spiders
ordinarily spin their own silk.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.456
So you can start to see how imaginative

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:06.136
and inspiring modes of making
exist in nature

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.816
that we can use to build capacity
around new bio-based industries.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.976
What we now have is the technology

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.816
to design, build, test and scale
these capabilities.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.096
At this present moment,

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.776
as we face the ecological
crisis in front of us,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.136
what we have to do is to determine

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.336
how we're going to build
these new material systems

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:37.136
so that they don't mirror
the damaging legacies of the oil age.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.616
How we're going to distribute them
to ensure a sustainable development

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.416
that is fair and equitable
across the world.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.896
And crucially, how we would like
the regulatory and ethical frameworks

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.376
that govern these technologies

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.800
to interact with our society.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.056
Biotechnology is going to touch
every part of our lived experience.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.296
It is living;

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.776
it is digital;

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.576
it is designed, and it can be crafted.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.720
This is a material future
that we must be bold enough to shape.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.776
Thank you.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.320
(Applause)
