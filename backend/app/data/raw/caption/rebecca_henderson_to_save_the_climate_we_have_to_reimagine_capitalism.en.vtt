Reviewer: Rhonda Jacobs

00:00:12.773 --> 00:00:14.300
I am a tree hugger.

00:00:14.942 --> 00:00:16.546
I spent much of my childhood

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.376
on the great lower limb
of a massive copper beech,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.219
alternately reading and looking up
at the sky through its branches.

00:00:23.243 --> 00:00:25.346
I felt safe and cared for

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.946
and connected to something
infinitely larger than myself.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.250
I thought the trees were immortal,
that they would always be here.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.966
But I was wrong.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.768
The trees are dying.

00:00:37.792 --> 00:00:40.576
Climate change is killing
the cedars of Lebanon

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.885
and the forests of the American West.

00:00:43.528 --> 00:00:45.470
And it's not just the trees.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.827
Since 1998, extreme heat
has killed more than 160,000 people,

00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:55.500
and unchecked climate change
could kill millions more.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.640
How did we get here?

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.936
There are many reasons, of course,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.427
but one of the most important

00:01:01.451 --> 00:01:05.310
is that we let capitalism
morph into something monstrous.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.666
I'm a huge fan of capitalism at its best.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.521
After all, I'm an economist
and a business school professor.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.816
I think genuinely free and fair markets

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.553
are one of the great inventions
of the human race.

00:01:19.035 --> 00:01:20.974
But here's the catch:

00:01:20.998 --> 00:01:25.813
markets only work their magic
when prices reflect real costs.

00:01:26.163 --> 00:01:28.734
And right now, prices
are badly out of whack.

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.956
We're letting the firms
who sell fossil fuels,

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.376
and indeed anyone
who emits greenhouse gases,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.123
cause enormous damage
for which they do not have to pay.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.483
And that is hardly fair.

00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:44.583
Imagine for a moment

00:01:44.607 --> 00:01:47.940
that my hands are filled
with a cloud of electrons,

00:01:47.964 --> 00:01:51.140
10 dollars' worth
of coal-fired electricity

00:01:51.164 --> 00:01:54.526
that could power your cell phone
for more than 10 years.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.976
That probably sounds
like a pretty good deal.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.132
But it's only so cheap

00:01:59.156 --> 00:02:02.028
because you're not paying
for the harm that it causes.

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:07.196
Burning coal sends poisons
like mercury and lead into the air,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.096
increasing healthcare costs
by billions of dollars

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.288
and causing the death

00:02:11.312 --> 00:02:14.187
of hundreds of thousands
of people every year.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.596
It also emits huge quantities
of carbon dioxide.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.263
So another part of the real cost of coal

00:02:21.287 --> 00:02:25.806
is the climate damage it will cause
and is already causing.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.946
More than a million acres
burned in California this summer,

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.956
and massive floods put a third
of Bangladesh under water.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.196
Hundreds of studies have tried
to put a number on these costs.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.834
My sense of this work,

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:43.096
and here I'm relying on my colleagues
in the School of Public Health

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.086
and my friends in economics,

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.376
is that generating 10 dollars' worth
of coal-fired electricity

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.166
causes at least eight dollars' worth
of harm to human health

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.555
and at least another
eight dollars' worth of climate damage

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.324
and probably much more.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.541
So the true cost
of this handful of electrons?

00:03:03.565 --> 00:03:05.211
It's not 10 dollars.

00:03:05.235 --> 00:03:08.118
It's something more like 26.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.386
The hidden costs of doing
things like burning oil and gas

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.055
and eating beef are similarly
enormous and just as unfair.

00:03:17.792 --> 00:03:21.586
Everyone who's trying
to build a clean economy

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.911
has to compete with firms
that are heavily subsidized

00:03:24.935 --> 00:03:28.640
by the destruction of our health
and the degradation of our climate.

00:03:29.306 --> 00:03:32.052
This is not the capitalism
I signed up for.

00:03:32.076 --> 00:03:36.640
This is not a market
that is either free or fair.

00:03:37.405 --> 00:03:38.738
So ...

00:03:39.557 --> 00:03:41.389
What do we do?

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.236
The "easy" answer
is that governments should insist

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.667
that anyone who emits greenhouse gases
pay for the damage that they cause.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.523
However, at the moment,

00:03:53.547 --> 00:03:56.466
there's not much sign
that governments are up for this,

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.856
partly because the fossil fuel companies
have spent the last 20 years

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.974
using their heavily subsidized profits

00:04:03.998 --> 00:04:06.553
to deny the reality of climate change

00:04:06.577 --> 00:04:08.205
and to shower the politicians,

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:11.296
who should be regulating them, with money.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.726
So here's my crazy idea.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.293
I think business should step up.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.321
I think business should fix capitalism.

00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:22.338
I know.
(Laughs)

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:26.518
Some of you are probably
thinking, "Fat chance."

00:04:27.237 --> 00:04:31.536
Didn't I just say that companies
are the ones denying the science,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.766
distorting the market
and lobbying the politicians?

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.043
I did.

00:04:36.817 --> 00:04:41.314
But fixing this is squarely
in the private sector's interest.

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:47.274
The truth is business is screwed
if we don't fix climate change.

00:04:47.725 --> 00:04:49.706
It's going to be hard to make money

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.404
when the great coastal
cities are under water

00:04:52.428 --> 00:04:57.106
and millions of angry people
are migrating north as the harvests fail.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.146
It's going to be tough
to keep free enterprise alive

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.236
if most people believe
the rich and the white

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.166
are using it to trash the planet
for their own benefit.

00:05:08.006 --> 00:05:11.476
So let me tell you
what this looks like on the ground.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.836
My friend Erik Osmundsen
left a cushy job in private equity

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.109
to become the CEO of a garbage company.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.298
That sounds like a slightly odd idea.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.203
But Erik wanted to make a difference,

00:05:26.227 --> 00:05:28.446
and changing the way that trash is handled

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.383
could reduce emissions
by billions of tons.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.906
Right away, he ran into a massive problem:

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.666
the industry was thoroughly corrupt.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.276
Firms were cutting costs
by dumping waste illegally,

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.192
the regulations were poorly enforced

00:05:43.216 --> 00:05:46.119
and the fines for violation were tiny.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.395
Erik announced he was going to run clean

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.476
and to raise prices
to cover the costs of doing so.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.785
Many of his senior team
thought he was crazy.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.156
Half of them quit.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.322
So did many of his customers.

00:06:00.346 --> 00:06:04.366
His competitors denounced him
for bringing the industry into disrepute,

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.021
and he started
to receive personal threats.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.833
But corruption works best
when it's hidden.

00:06:11.493 --> 00:06:15.753
As soon as Erik went public,
people started to step up.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.404
A few customers were willing to pay more.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.207
His investors agreed that taking
the high road could pay off.

00:06:22.635 --> 00:06:27.238
Those of his employees who remained
loved the idea of taking a stand

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:30.445
and found all kinds
of legal ways to cut costs.

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:32.665
Erik persuaded several of his competitors

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:36.057
to join him in refusing
to dispose of garbage illegally,

00:06:36.081 --> 00:06:40.299
and it got much tougher
for regulators to stay on the sidelines.

00:06:40.989 --> 00:06:44.526
Today, Erik's company, Norsk Gjenvinning,

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.036
is one of the largest
recycling companies in Scandinavia.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.630
Let me generalize.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.435
These are the four pillars of change:

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.896
Build a business
that can set the right price

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.893
and still be profitable.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.169
Persuade your competitors
to do the same thing.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.304
Make sure that investors understand
there's money to be made.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.046
And push governments
to put the right price into law

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.429
so that bottom-feeders can't survive.

00:07:11.783 --> 00:07:14.601
I'm not telling you we've got this nailed.

00:07:14.903 --> 00:07:16.629
Things are pretty desperate.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.445
But there are thousands
of businesspeople like Erik,

00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:23.932
and there are millions of people like us.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.957
And we are customers, employees,
investors and citizens.

00:07:29.981 --> 00:07:33.596
Instead of giving up
on capitalism, let's fix it

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.166
by making sure that markets
are truly fair and truly free,

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.916
and that no one can dump garbage on us

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.602
and walk away without paying for it.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:49.828
We have the resources and the technology
to solve climate change.

00:07:49.852 --> 00:07:52.661
Together, we can save the trees

00:07:52.685 --> 00:07:54.575
and each other.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.763
Thank you.
