00:00:12.761 --> 00:00:14.976
Four years ago, here at TED,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.336
I announced Planet's Mission 1:

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.216
to launch a fleet of satellites

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.520
that would image
the entire Earth, every day,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.200
and to democratize access to it.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.736
The problem we were trying
to solve was simple.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.856
Satellite imagery you find online is old,
typically years old,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.816
yet human activity was happening
on days and weeks and months,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.096
and you can't fix what you can't see.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.896
We wanted to give people the tools
to see that change and take action.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.856
The beautiful Blue Marble image,
taken by the Apollo 17 astronauts in 1972

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.160
had helped humanity become aware
that we're on a fragile planet.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.656
And we wanted to take it
to the next level,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.136
to give people the tools
to take action, to take care of it.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.216
Well, after many
Apollo projects of our own,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.200
launching the largest fleet
of satellites in human history,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.120
we have reached our target.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.736
Today, Planet images
the entire Earth, every single day.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.976
Mission accomplished.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.536
(Applause)

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.760
Thank you.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.576
It's taken 21 rocket launches --

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.760
this animation makes it look
really simple -- it was not.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.496
And we now have
over 200 satellites in orbit,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.456
downlinking their data to 31 ground
stations we built around the planet.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.776
In total, we get 1.5 million 29-megapixel
images of the Earth down each day.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.216
And on any one location
of the Earth's surface,

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.736
we now have on average
more than 500 images.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.640
A deep stack of data,
documenting immense change.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.856
And lots of people are using this imagery.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.016
Agricultural companies are using it
to improve farmers' crop yields.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.216
Consumer-mapping companies are using it
to improve the maps you find online.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.336
Governments are using it
for border security

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.040
or helping with disaster response
after floods and fires and earthquakes.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.856
And lots of NGOs are using it.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.296
So, for tracking
and stopping deforestation.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.856
Or helping to find the refugees
fleeing Myanmar.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.256
Or to track all the activities
in the ongoing crisis in Syria,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.960
holding all sides accountable.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.096
And today, I'm pleased
to announce Planet stories.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.416
Anyone can go online to planet.com

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.680
open an account and see
all of our imagery online.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.576
It's a bit like Google Earth,
except it's up-to-date imagery,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.280
and you can see back through time.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.736
You can compare any two days

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.640
and see the dramatic changes
that happen around our planet.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.960
Or you can create a time lapse
through the 500 images that we have

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.160
and see that change
dramatically over time.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.720
And you can share these over social media.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.736
It's pretty cool.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.976
(Applause)

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.200
Thank you.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.896
We initially created this tool
for news journalists,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.656
who wanted to get unbiased information
about world events.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.896
But now we've opened it up
for anyone to use,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.920
for nonprofit or personal uses.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.016
And we hope it will give people the tools
to find and see the changes on the planet

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.240
and take action.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.176
OK, so humanity now has this database
of information about the planet,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.416
changing over time.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.496
What's our next mission, what's Mission 2?

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.960
In short, it's space plus AI.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.896
What we're doing
with artificial intelligence

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.016
is finding the objects
in all the satellite images.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.576
The same AI tools that are used
to find cats in videos online

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.496
can also be used to find
information on our pictures.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.856
So, imagine if you can say,
this is a ship, this is a tree,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.256
this is a car, this is a road,
this is a building, this is a truck.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.016
And if you could do that
for all of the millions of images

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.296
coming down per day,

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.056
then you basically create a database

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.736
of all the sizable objects
on the planet, every day.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.320
And that database is searchable.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.616
So that's exactly what we're doing.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.896
Here's a prototype, working on our API.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.376
This is Beijing.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.256
So, imagine if we wanted
to count the planes in the airport.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.136
We select the airport,

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.536
and it finds the planes in today's image,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.816
and finds the planes
in the whole stack of images before it,

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.736
and then outputs this graph of all
the planes in Beijing airport over time.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.336
Of course, you could do this
for all the airports around the world.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.296
And let's look here
in the port of Vancouver.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.856
So, we would do the same,
but this time we would look for vessels.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.016
So, we zoom in on Vancouver,
we select the area,

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.096
and we search for ships.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.978
And it outputs where all the ships are.

00:04:42.002 --> 00:04:45.216
Now, imagine how useful this would be
to people in coast guards

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.976
who are trying to track
and stop illegal fishing.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.056
See, legal fishing vessels

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.016
transmit their locations
using AIS beacons.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.656
But we frequently find ships
that are not doing that.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.456
The pictures don't lie.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.176
And so, coast guards could use that

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.376
and go and find
those illegal fishing vessels.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.576
And soon we'll add
not just ships and planes

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.896
but all the other objects,

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.816
and we can output data feeds

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.376
of those locations
of all these objects over time

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.456
that can be integrated digitally
from people's work flows.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.536
In time, we could get
more sophisticated browsers

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.896
that people pull in
from different sources.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.616
But ultimately, I can imagine us
abstracting out the imagery entirely

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.056
and just having a queryable
interface to the Earth.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.496
Imagine if we could just ask,

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.056
"Hey, how many houses
are there in Pakistan?

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.016
Give me a plot of that versus time."

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.216
"How many trees are there in the Amazon

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.456
and can you tell me the locations
of the trees that have been felled

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.136
between this week and last week?"

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.376
Wouldn't that be great?

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.536
Well, that's what
we're trying to go towards,

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.416
and we call it "Queryable Earth."

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.336
So, Planet's Mission 1 was
to image the whole planet every day

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.696
and make it accessible.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.536
Planet's Mission 2 is to index
all the objects on the planet over time

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.800
and make it queryable.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.896
Let me leave you with an analogy.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.320
Google indexed what's on the internet
and made it searchable.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.336
Well, we're indexing what's on the Earth
and making it searchable.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.696
Thank you very much.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.240
(Applause)
