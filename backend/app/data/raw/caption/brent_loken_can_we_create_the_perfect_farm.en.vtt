00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.167
About 10,000 years ago,
humans began to farm.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.816
This agricultural revolution
was a turning point in our history

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.036
that enabled people to settle,
build and create.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.968
In short, agriculture
enabled the existence of civilization.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.856
Today, approximately 40 percent
of our planet is farmland.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.776
Spread all over the world,

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.521
these agricultural lands
are the pieces to a global puzzle

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:39.186
we are all facing:

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.446
in the future, how can we feed
every member of a growing population

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.215
a healthy diet?

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.536
Meeting this goal will require

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.625
nothing short of a second
agricultural revolution.

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.646
The first agricultural revolution

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.736
was characterized
by expansion and exploitation,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.591
feeding people at the expense
of forests, wildlife and water

00:01:03.615 --> 00:01:07.416
and destabilizing the climate
in the process.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.397
That's not an option the next time around.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.996
Agriculture depends on a stable climate

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.996
with predictable seasons
and weather patterns.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.046
This means we can't keep
expanding our agricultural lands,

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.336
because doing so will undermine
the environmental conditions

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.603
that make agriculture possible
in the first place.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.136
Instead, the next agricultural revolution

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.646
will have to increase the output
of our existing farmland for the long term

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.431
while protecting biodiversity,
conserving water

00:01:39.455 --> 00:01:43.168
and reducing pollution
and greenhouse gas emissions.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.746
So what will the future farms look like?

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.176
This drone is part of a fleet
that monitors the crops below.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.116
The farm may look haphazard

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.206
but is a delicately engineered
use of the land

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.906
that intertwines crops and livestock
with wild habitats.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.886
Conventional farming methods
cleared large swathes of land

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.196
and planted them with a single crop,

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.871
eradicating wildlife

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:14.246
and emitting huge amounts
of greenhouse gases in the process.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.001
This approach aims to correct that damage.

00:02:18.025 --> 00:02:20.096
Meanwhile, moving among the crops,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.186
teams of field robots
apply fertilizer in targeted doses.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.656
Inside the soil,

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.036
hundreds of sensors gather data
on nutrients and water levels.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.211
This information reduces
unnecessary water use

00:02:34.235 --> 00:02:38.506
and tells farmers where they should apply
more and less fertilizer

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.990
instead of causing pollution
by showering it across the whole farm.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.281
But the farms of the future
won't be all sensors and robots.

00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:51.639
These technologies are designed
to help us produce food

00:02:51.663 --> 00:02:54.006
in a way that works with the environment

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.926
rather than against it,

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.023
taking into account
the nuances of local ecosystems.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.202
Lower-cost agricultural practices
can also serve those same goals

00:03:07.226 --> 00:03:10.143
and are much more accessible
to many farmers.

00:03:10.167 --> 00:03:14.526
In fact, many such practices
are already in use today

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.826
and stand to have
an increasingly large impact

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.514
as more farmers adopt them.

00:03:20.538 --> 00:03:21.739
In Costa Rica,

00:03:21.763 --> 00:03:26.052
farmers have intertwined farmland
with tropical habitat so successfully

00:03:26.076 --> 00:03:30.436
that they have significantly contributed
to doubling the country's forest cover.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.446
This provides food
and habitat for wildlife

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.446
as well as natural pollination
and pest control

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.386
from the birds and insects
these farms attract,

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.800
producing food while restoring the planet.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.396
In the United States,

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.946
ranchers are raising cattle
on grasslands composed of native species,

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.221
generating a valuable protein source

00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:56.095
using production methods that store carbon
and protect biodiversity.

00:03:56.824 --> 00:03:59.696
In Bangladesh, Cambodia and Nepal,

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.535
new approaches to rice production

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:05.596
may dramatically decrease
greenhouse gas emissions in the future.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.196
Rice is a staple food
for three billion people

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.926
and the main source of livelihood
for millions of households.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.276
More than 90 percent of rice
is grown in flooded paddies,

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.386
which use a lot of water

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.141
and release 11 percent
of annual methane emissions,

00:04:23.165 --> 00:04:25.291
which accounts for one to two percent

00:04:25.315 --> 00:04:29.686
of total annual greenhouse gas
emissions globally.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.693
By experimenting with new strains of rice,

00:04:32.717 --> 00:04:34.066
irrigating less

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.056
and adopting less labor-intensive
ways of planting seeds,

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.487
farmers in these countries

00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:43.236
have already increased
their incomes and crop yields

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.790
while cutting down
on greenhouse gas emissions.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.451
In Zambia,

00:04:48.475 --> 00:04:52.689
numerous organizations
are investing in locally specific methods

00:04:52.713 --> 00:04:56.134
to improve crop production,
reduce forest loss

00:04:56.158 --> 00:04:59.541
and improve livelihoods for local farmers.

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:02.236
These efforts are projected
to increase crop yield

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.030
by almost a quarter
over the next few decades.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.261
If combined with methods
to combat deforestation in the region,

00:05:10.285 --> 00:05:11.616
they could move the country

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.933
toward a resilient, climate-focused
agricultural sector.

00:05:16.887 --> 00:05:18.077
And in India,

00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:22.275
where up to 40 percent
of post-harvest food is lost or wasted

00:05:22.299 --> 00:05:23.911
due to poor infrastructure,

00:05:23.935 --> 00:05:29.005
farmers have already started to implement
solar-powered cold storage capsules

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:32.841
that help thousands of rural farmers
preserve their produce

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:36.280
and become a viable part
of the supply chain.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.426
It will take all of these methods,

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.126
from the most high-tech
to the lowest-cost,

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.214
to revolutionize farming.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.581
High-tech interventions stand to amplify

00:05:47.605 --> 00:05:51.006
climate- and conservation-oriented
approaches to farming,

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.891
and large producers will need to invest
in implementing these technologies.

00:05:55.915 --> 00:05:59.546
Meanwhile, we'll have to expand access
to the lower-cost methods

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.700
for smaller-scale farmers.

00:06:01.724 --> 00:06:06.856
This vision of future farming
will also require a global shift

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.186
toward more plant-based diets

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.736
and huge reductions
in food loss and waste,

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.588
both of which will reduce
pressure on the land

00:06:15.612 --> 00:06:19.531
and allow farmers to do more
with what they have available.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.440
If we optimize food production,
both on land and sea,

00:06:24.464 --> 00:06:25.926
we can feed humanity

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.226
within the environmental
limits of the earth,

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.606
but there's a very small margin of error,

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.116
and it will take unprecedented
global cooperation

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.846
and coordination of the agricultural
lands we have today.
