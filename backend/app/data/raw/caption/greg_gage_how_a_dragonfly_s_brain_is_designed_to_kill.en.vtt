00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.256
Greg Gage: If I asked you
to think of a ferocious killer animal,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.776
you'd probably think of a lion,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.616
and for all the wonderful
predatory skills that a lion has,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.336
it still only has about a 20 percent
success rate at catching a meal.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.376
Now, one of the most successful hunters

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.456
in the entire animal kingdom
is surprising:

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.736
the dragonfly.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.536
Now, dragonflies are killer flies,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.136
and when they see a smaller fly,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.136
they have about a 97 percent
chance of catching it for a meal.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.416
And this is in mid-flight.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.616
But how can such
a small insect be so precise?

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.496
In this episode, we're going to see

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.200
how the dragonfly's brain is highly
specialized to be a deadly killer.

00:00:45.224 --> 00:00:48.455
[DIY Neuroscience]

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.496
So what makes the dragonfly
one of the most successful predators

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.736
in the animal kingdom?

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.016
One, it's the eyes.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.896
It has near 360-degree vision.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.336
Two, the wings.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.176
With individual control of its wings,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.576
the dragonfly can move
precisely in any direction.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.976
But the real secret
to the dragonfly's success

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.096
is how its brain coordinates
this complex information

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.656
between the eyes and the wings

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.256
and turns hunting into a simple reflex.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.661
To study this, Jaimie's been
spending a lot of time

00:01:13.685 --> 00:01:15.336
socializing with dragonflies.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.296
What do you need to do your experiments?

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:19.656
Jaimie Spahr: First of all,
you need dragonflies.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.136
Oliver: I have a mesh cage
to catch the dragonflies.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.296
JS: The more I worked with them,
the more terrified I got of them.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.096
They're actually very scary,
especially under a microscope.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.256
They have really sharp mandibles,
are generally pretty aggressive,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.016
which I guess also helps them
to be really good predators.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.176
GG: In order to learn what's going on
inside the dragonfly's brain

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.416
when it sees a prey,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.576
we're going to eavesdrop in
on a conversation

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.136
between the eyes and the wings,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.922
and to do that, we need
to anesthetize the dragonfly on ice

00:01:44.946 --> 00:01:48.336
and make sure we protect its wings
so that we can release it afterwards.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.016
Now, the dragonfly's brain is made up
of specialized cells called neurons

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.216
and these neurons
are what allow the dragonfly

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.896
to see and move so quickly.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.976
The individual neurons form circuits
by connecting to each other

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.616
via long, tiny threads called axons

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.896
and the neurons communicate
over these axons using electricity.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.376
In the dragonfly, we're going to place
little metal wires, or electrodes,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.656
along the axon tracks,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.176
and this is what's really cool.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.216
In the dragonfly, there's only 16 neurons;

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.496
that's eight per eye

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.976
that tell the wings
exactly where the target is.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.216
We've placed the electrodes
so that we can record from these neurons

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.936
that connect the eyes to the wings.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.816
Whenever a message is being passed
from the eye to the wing,

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.576
our electrode intercepts that conversation
in the form of an electrical current,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.816
and it amplifies it.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.896
Now, we can both hear it and see it
in the form of a spike,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.176
which we also call an action potential.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.456
Now let's listen in.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.936
Right now, we have the dragonfly
flipped upside down,

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.576
so he's looking down towards the ground.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.576
We're going to take a prey,
or what we sometimes call a target.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.096
In this case, the target's
going to be a fake fly.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.640
We're going to move it
into the dragonfly's sights.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.296
(Buzzing)

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.520
Oh!

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.920
Oh, look at that.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.240
Look at that, but it's only
in one direction.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.080
Oh, yes!

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.696
You don't see any spikes
when I go forward,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.616
but they're all when I come back.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.096
In our experiments,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.616
we were able to see
that the neurons of the dragonfly

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.896
fired when we moved the target
in one direction but not the other.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.176
Now, why is that?

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.058
Remember when I said that the dragonfly

00:03:21.082 --> 00:03:23.136
had near 360-degree vision.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.656
Well, there's a section
of the eye called the fovea

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.576
and this is the part
that has the sharpest visual acuity,

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.296
and you can think of it as its crosshairs.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.496
Remember when I told you the dragonfly had
individual precise control of its wings?

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.576
When a dragonfly sees its prey,
it trains its crosshairs on it

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.976
and along its axons
it sends messages only to the neurons

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.696
that control the parts of the wings

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.056
that are needed
to keep that dragonfly on target.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.056
So if the prey is
on the left of the dragonfly,

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.856
only the neurons that are tugging
the wings to the left are fired.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.376
And if the prey moves
to the right of the dragonfly,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.576
those same neurons are not needed,
so they're going to remain quiet.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.536
And the dragonfly speeds toward the prey

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.816
at a fixed angle that's communicated
by this crosshairs to the wings,

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.856
and then boom, dinner.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.576
Now, all this happens in a split second,
and it's effortless for the dragonfly.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.176
It's almost like a reflex.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.296
And this whole incredibly efficient
process is called fixation.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.936
But there's one more
story to this process.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.056
We saw how the neurons
respond to movements,

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.000
but how does the dragonfly know
that something really is prey?

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.216
This is where size matters.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.760
Let's show the dragonfly a series of dots.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.216
Oh, yeah!

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.456
JS: Yeah, it prefers that one.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.736
GG: Out of all the sizes,

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.280
we found that the dragonfly responded
to smaller targets over larger ones.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.736
In other words, the dragonfly
was programmed to go after smaller flies

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.096
versus something much larger, like a bird.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.696
And as soon as it recognizes
something as prey,

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.536
that poor little fly
only has seconds to live.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.136
Today we got to see
how the dragonfly's brain works

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.840
to make it a very efficient killer.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.176
And let's be thankful
that we didn't live 300 million years ago

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.080
when dragonflies were the size of cats.
