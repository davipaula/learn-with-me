00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:14.674
Ever since I can remember,

00:00:14.698 --> 00:00:18.933
African elephants have filled me
with a sense of complete awe.

00:00:19.532 --> 00:00:23.069
They are the largest land mammal
alive today on planet Earth,

00:00:23.093 --> 00:00:25.252
weighing up to seven tons,

00:00:25.276 --> 00:00:28.514
standing three and a half meters
tall at the shoulder.

00:00:28.538 --> 00:00:31.982
They can eat up to 400 kilos
of food in a day,

00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:36.545
and they disperse vital plant seeds
across thousands of kilometers

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:39.036
during their 50-to-60-year life span.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.863
Central to their compassionate
and complex society are the matriarchs.

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:47.601
These female, strong leaders
nurture the young

00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:50.688
and navigate their way
through the challenges of the African bush

00:00:50.712 --> 00:00:52.912
to find food, water and security.

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:55.395
Their societies are so complex,

00:00:55.419 --> 00:00:57.721
we're yet to still fully tease apart

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:00.332
how they communicate,
how they verbalize to each other,

00:01:00.356 --> 00:01:01.982
how their dialects work.

00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:06.077
And we don't really understand yet
how they navigate the landscape,

00:01:06.101 --> 00:01:09.050
remembering the safest places
to cross a river.

00:01:09.728 --> 00:01:11.486
I'm pretty sure that like me,

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.244
most of you in this room
have a similar positive emotional response

00:01:15.268 --> 00:01:17.668
to these most magnificent of all animals.

00:01:18.117 --> 00:01:20.537
It's really hard not to have
watched a documentary,

00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:22.094
learned about their intelligence

00:01:22.118 --> 00:01:24.744
or, if you've been lucky,
to see them for yourselves

00:01:24.768 --> 00:01:26.402
on safari in the wild.

00:01:27.085 --> 00:01:28.529
But I wonder how many of you

00:01:28.553 --> 00:01:32.694
have been truly,
utterly terrified by them.

00:01:34.482 --> 00:01:36.744
I was lucky to be brought up
in Southern Africa

00:01:36.768 --> 00:01:38.236
by two teacher parents

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.315
who had long holidays
but very short budgets.

00:01:41.898 --> 00:01:45.318
And so we used to take
our old Ford Cortina Estate,

00:01:45.342 --> 00:01:47.374
and with my sister, we'd pile in the back,

00:01:47.398 --> 00:01:50.215
take our tents and go camping
in the different game reserves

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:51.501
in Southern Africa.

00:01:51.525 --> 00:01:54.977
It really was heaven for a young,
budding zoologist like myself.

00:01:55.398 --> 00:01:57.747
But I remember even at that young age

00:01:57.771 --> 00:02:01.429
that I found the tall electric fences
blocking off the game parks

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:02.712
quite divisive.

00:02:03.077 --> 00:02:05.752
Sure, they were keeping elephants
out of the communities,

00:02:05.776 --> 00:02:09.204
but they also kept communities
out of their wild spaces.

00:02:10.236 --> 00:02:13.632
It really was quite a challenge to me
at that young age.

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:17.355
It was only when I moved to Kenya
at the age of 14,

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:22.101
when I got to connect to the vast,
wild open spaces of East Africa.

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:25.879
And it is here now
that I feel truly, instinctively,

00:02:25.903 --> 00:02:27.188
really at home.

00:02:27.902 --> 00:02:31.585
I spent many, many happy years
studying elephant behavior in a tent,

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.615
in Samburu National Reserve,

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:37.876
under the guideship of professor
Fritz Vollrath and Iain Douglas-Hamilton,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.535
studying for my PhD and understanding
the complexities of elephant societies.

00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:47.729
But now, in my role as head
of the human-elephant coexistence program

00:02:47.753 --> 00:02:49.078
for Save the Elephants,

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:53.218
we're seeing so much change
happening so fast

00:02:53.242 --> 00:02:57.440
that it's urged a change
in some of our research programs.

00:02:57.464 --> 00:03:00.956
No longer can we just sit
and understand elephant societies

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.782
or study just how to stop the ivory trade,

00:03:03.806 --> 00:03:06.244
which is horrific and still ongoing.

00:03:06.268 --> 00:03:09.022
We're having to change
our resources more and more

00:03:09.046 --> 00:03:13.188
to look at this rising problem
of human-elephant conflict,

00:03:13.212 --> 00:03:16.791
as people and pachyderms compete
for space and resources.

00:03:17.536 --> 00:03:19.585
It was only as recently as the 1970s

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.902
that we used to have 1.2 million elephants
roaming across Africa.

00:03:23.926 --> 00:03:28.664
Today, we're edging closer
to only having 400,000 left.

00:03:29.093 --> 00:03:33.363
And at the same time period,
the human population has quadrupled,

00:03:33.387 --> 00:03:35.704
and the land is being
fragmented at such a pace

00:03:35.728 --> 00:03:38.261
that it's really hard to keep up with.

00:03:38.673 --> 00:03:42.355
Too often, these migrating elephants
end up stuck inside communities,

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:43.673
looking for food and water

00:03:43.697 --> 00:03:46.252
but ending up breaking open water tanks,

00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:47.433
breaking pipes

00:03:47.457 --> 00:03:50.387
and, of course, breaking
into food stores for food.

00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:52.344
It's really a huge challenge.

00:03:52.968 --> 00:03:54.491
Can you imagine the terror

00:03:54.515 --> 00:03:58.108
of an elephant literally
ripping the roof off your mud hut

00:03:58.132 --> 00:03:59.428
in the middle of the night

00:03:59.452 --> 00:04:01.516
and having to hold your children away

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.958
as the trunk reaches in,
looking for food in the pitch dark?

00:04:06.585 --> 00:04:09.315
These elephants
also trample and eat crops,

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:11.605
and this is traditionally eroding away

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.561
that tolerance that people
used to have for elephants.

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:18.847
And sadly, we're losing
these animals by the day

00:04:18.871 --> 00:04:21.855
and, in some countries, by the hour --

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:23.260
to not only ivory poaching

00:04:23.284 --> 00:04:25.895
but this rapid rise
in human-elephant conflict

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.585
as they compete for space and resources.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.156
It's a massive challenge.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.141
I mean, how do you keep
seven-ton pachyderms,

00:04:33.165 --> 00:04:35.242
that often come in groups of 10 or 12,

00:04:35.266 --> 00:04:37.720
out of these very small rural farms

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:39.252
when you're dealing with people

00:04:39.276 --> 00:04:42.371
who are living
on the very edge of poverty?

00:04:42.395 --> 00:04:43.796
They don't have big budgets.

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.759
How do you resolve this issue?

00:04:47.157 --> 00:04:50.760
Well, one issue is, you can just start
to build electric fences,

00:04:50.784 --> 00:04:52.522
and this is happening across Africa,

00:04:52.546 --> 00:04:54.156
we're seeing this more and more.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.822
But they are dividing up areas
and blocking corridors.

00:04:57.846 --> 00:05:01.251
And I'm telling you, these elephants
don't think much of it either,

00:05:01.275 --> 00:05:04.164
particularly if they're blocking
a really special water hole

00:05:04.188 --> 00:05:05.371
where they need water,

00:05:05.395 --> 00:05:08.103
or if there's a very attractive
female on the other side.

00:05:08.127 --> 00:05:10.658
It doesn't take long
to knock down one of these poles.

00:05:10.682 --> 00:05:12.738
And as soon as there's a gap in the fence,

00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:14.428
they go back, talk to their mates

00:05:14.452 --> 00:05:16.335
and suddenly they're all through,

00:05:16.359 --> 00:05:19.857
and now you have 12 elephants
on the community side of the fence.

00:05:19.881 --> 00:05:22.032
And now you're really in trouble.

00:05:22.056 --> 00:05:25.575
People keep trying to come up
with new designs for electric fences.

00:05:26.421 --> 00:05:29.334
Well, these elephants
don't think much of those either.

00:05:29.761 --> 00:05:32.710
(Laughter)

00:05:34.296 --> 00:05:39.439
So rather than having these hard-line,
straight, electric,

00:05:39.463 --> 00:05:43.124
really divisive migratory-blocking fences,

00:05:43.148 --> 00:05:45.757
there must be other ways
to look at this challenge.

00:05:45.781 --> 00:05:48.616
I'm much more interested in holistic
and natural methods

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.520
to keep elephants and people
apart where necessary.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.823
Simply talking to people,

00:05:53.847 --> 00:05:56.109
talking to rural pastoralists
in northern Kenya

00:05:56.133 --> 00:05:58.680
who have so much knowledge about the bush,

00:05:58.704 --> 00:06:02.680
we discovered this story that they had
that elephants would not feed on trees

00:06:02.704 --> 00:06:04.570
that had wild beehives in them.

00:06:04.594 --> 00:06:06.611
Now this was an interesting story.

00:06:06.635 --> 00:06:08.643
As the elephants
were foraging on the tree,

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:12.270
they would break branches
and perhaps break open a wild beehive.

00:06:12.294 --> 00:06:15.651
And those bees would fly out
of their natural nests

00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:17.347
and sting the elephants.

00:06:17.371 --> 00:06:18.958
Now if the elephants got stung,

00:06:18.982 --> 00:06:21.625
perhaps they would remember
that this tree was dangerous

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:23.839
and they wouldn't come back
to that same site.

00:06:23.863 --> 00:06:27.316
It seems impossible that they could be
stung through their thick skin --

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.706
elephant skin is around
two centimeters thick.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.494
But it seems that they sting them
around the watery areas,

00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:36.505
around the eyes, behind the ears,
in the mouth, up the trunk.

00:06:36.946 --> 00:06:40.183
You can imagine they would
remember that very quickly.

00:06:40.207 --> 00:06:43.073
And it's not really one sting
that they're scared of.

00:06:43.097 --> 00:06:46.065
African bees have a phenomenal ability:

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:48.864
when they sting in one site,
they release a pheromone

00:06:48.888 --> 00:06:52.103
that triggers the rest of the bees
to come and sting the same site.

00:06:52.127 --> 00:06:54.458
So it's not one beesting
that they're scared of --

00:06:54.492 --> 00:06:56.364
it's perhaps thousands of beestings,

00:06:56.388 --> 00:06:59.493
coming to sting in the same area --
that they're afraid of.

00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:01.596
And of course, a good matriarch

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.548
would always keep her young
away from such a threat.

00:07:04.572 --> 00:07:06.509
Young calves have much thinner skins,

00:07:06.533 --> 00:07:08.572
and it's potential
that they could be stung

00:07:08.596 --> 00:07:10.463
through their thinner skins.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.442
So for my PhD,
I had this unusual challenge

00:07:14.466 --> 00:07:15.848
of trying to work out

00:07:15.872 --> 00:07:19.819
how African elephants
and African bees would interact,

00:07:19.843 --> 00:07:22.716
when the theory was
that they wouldn't interact at all.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.772
How was I going to study this?

00:07:24.796 --> 00:07:28.776
Well, what I did was I took the sound
of disturbed African honey bees,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.220
and I played it back to elephants
resting under trees

00:07:32.244 --> 00:07:33.939
through a wireless speaker system,

00:07:33.963 --> 00:07:38.442
so I could understand how they would react
as if there were wild bees in the area.

00:07:38.466 --> 00:07:41.553
And it turns out that they react
quite dramatically

00:07:41.577 --> 00:07:43.844
to the sound of African wild bees.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:48.617
Here we are, playing the bee sounds
back to this amazing group of elephants.

00:07:48.641 --> 00:07:51.362
You can see the ears going up, going out,

00:07:51.386 --> 00:07:53.839
they're turning their heads
from side to side,

00:07:53.863 --> 00:07:56.601
one elephant is flicking her trunk
to try and smell.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.082
There's another elephant
that kicks one of calves on the ground

00:08:00.106 --> 00:08:02.765
to tell it to get up
as if there is a threat.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.829
And one elephant triggers a retreat,

00:08:05.853 --> 00:08:09.903
and soon the whole family of elephants
are running after her

00:08:09.927 --> 00:08:13.126
across the savannah in a cloud of dust.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:14.854
(Sound of bees buzzing)

00:08:20.394 --> 00:08:21.679
(Sound of bees ends)

00:08:21.703 --> 00:08:26.028
Now I've done this experiment
many, many times,

00:08:26.052 --> 00:08:28.703
and the elephants almost always flee.

00:08:28.727 --> 00:08:30.479
Not only do they run away,

00:08:30.503 --> 00:08:32.590
but they dust themselves
as they're running,

00:08:32.614 --> 00:08:34.947
as if to knock bees out of the air.

00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:38.991
And we placed infrasonic microphones
around the elephants

00:08:39.015 --> 00:08:40.768
as we did these experiments.

00:08:40.792 --> 00:08:44.443
And it turns out they're communicating
to each other in infrasonic rumbles

00:08:44.467 --> 00:08:46.403
to warn each other of the threat of bees

00:08:46.427 --> 00:08:48.493
and to stay away from the area.

00:08:49.038 --> 00:08:50.664
So these behavioral discoveries

00:08:50.688 --> 00:08:53.188
really helped us understand
how elephants would react

00:08:53.212 --> 00:08:55.561
should they hear or see bee sounds.

00:08:55.585 --> 00:08:59.704
This led me to invent a novel design
for a beehive fence,

00:08:59.728 --> 00:09:03.204
which we are now building around small,
one-to-two-acre farms

00:09:03.228 --> 00:09:05.941
on the most vulnerable
frontline areas of Africa

00:09:05.965 --> 00:09:08.609
where humans and elephants
are competing for space.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.349
These beehive fences
are very, very simple.

00:09:11.373 --> 00:09:14.625
We use 12 beehives and 12 dummy hives

00:09:14.649 --> 00:09:17.045
to protect one acre of farmland.

00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:19.363
Now a dummy hive
is simply a piece of plywood

00:09:19.387 --> 00:09:21.625
which we cut into squares, paint yellow

00:09:21.649 --> 00:09:23.307
and hang in between the hives.

00:09:23.331 --> 00:09:25.276
We're basically tricking the elephants

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.125
into thinking there are more beehives
than there really are.

00:09:28.149 --> 00:09:30.990
And of course, it literally
halves the cost of the fence.

00:09:31.014 --> 00:09:32.671
So there's a hive and a dummy hive

00:09:32.695 --> 00:09:34.442
and a beehive and now dummy hive,

00:09:34.466 --> 00:09:36.942
every 10 meters
around the outside boundary.

00:09:36.966 --> 00:09:38.601
They're held up by posts

00:09:38.625 --> 00:09:40.745
with a shade roof to protect the bees,

00:09:40.769 --> 00:09:43.921
and they're interconnected
with a simple piece of plain wire,

00:09:43.945 --> 00:09:46.379
which goes all the way around,
connecting the hives.

00:09:46.403 --> 00:09:48.859
So if an elephant tries to enter the farm,

00:09:48.883 --> 00:09:50.729
he will avoid the beehive at all cost,

00:09:50.753 --> 00:09:54.059
but he might try and push through
between the hive and the dummy hive,

00:09:54.083 --> 00:09:57.423
causing all the beehives to swing
as the wire hits his chest.

00:09:57.447 --> 00:09:59.408
And as we know from our research work,

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:02.347
this will cause the elephants
to flee and run away --

00:10:02.371 --> 00:10:06.108
and hopefully remember
not to come back to that risky area.

00:10:06.132 --> 00:10:07.863
The bees swarm out of the hive,

00:10:07.887 --> 00:10:10.481
and they really scare the elephants away.

00:10:10.505 --> 00:10:13.974
These beehive fences we're studying
using things like camera traps

00:10:13.998 --> 00:10:16.355
to help us understand
how elephants are responding

00:10:16.379 --> 00:10:17.584
to them at night time,

00:10:17.608 --> 00:10:19.870
which is when most
of the crop raiding occurs.

00:10:19.894 --> 00:10:22.218
And we found in our study farms

00:10:22.242 --> 00:10:24.958
that we're keeping
up to 80 percent of elephants

00:10:24.982 --> 00:10:27.466
outside of the boundaries of these farms.

00:10:27.966 --> 00:10:32.720
And the bees and the beehive fences
are also pollinating the fields.

00:10:32.744 --> 00:10:36.410
So we're having a great reduction
both in elephant crop raids

00:10:36.434 --> 00:10:39.097
and a boost in yield
through the pollination services

00:10:39.121 --> 00:10:41.791
that the bees are giving
to the crops themselves.

00:10:42.585 --> 00:10:45.258
The strength of the beehive fences
is really important --

00:10:45.282 --> 00:10:47.197
the colonies have to be very strong.

00:10:47.221 --> 00:10:50.173
So we're trying to help farmers
grow pollinator-friendly crops

00:10:50.197 --> 00:10:52.221
to boost their hives,

00:10:52.245 --> 00:10:53.872
boost the strength of their bees

00:10:53.896 --> 00:10:56.767
and, of course, produce
the most amazing honey.

00:10:56.791 --> 00:11:00.926
This honey is so valuable as an extra
livelihood income for the farmers.

00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:03.276
It's a healthy alternative to sugar,

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.014
and in our community,

00:11:05.038 --> 00:11:07.553
it's a very valuable present
to give a mother-in-law,

00:11:07.577 --> 00:11:09.465
which makes it almost priceless.

00:11:09.489 --> 00:11:11.616
(Laughter)

00:11:11.942 --> 00:11:13.607
We now bottle up this honey,

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:17.734
and we've called this wild beautiful honey
Elephant-Friendly Honey.

00:11:17.758 --> 00:11:18.909
It is a fun name,

00:11:18.933 --> 00:11:21.123
but it also attracts
attention to our project

00:11:21.147 --> 00:11:23.552
and helps people understand
what we're trying to do

00:11:23.576 --> 00:11:24.728
to save elephants.

00:11:24.752 --> 00:11:26.498
We're working now with so many women

00:11:26.522 --> 00:11:29.103
in over 60 human-elephant conflict sites

00:11:29.127 --> 00:11:31.634
in 19 countries in Africa and Asia

00:11:31.658 --> 00:11:33.688
to build these beehive fences,

00:11:33.712 --> 00:11:36.138
working very, very closely
with so many farmers

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:38.442
but particularly now with women farmers,

00:11:38.466 --> 00:11:41.592
helping them to live better
in harmony with elephants.

00:11:41.616 --> 00:11:45.060
One of the things we're trying to do
is develop a toolbox of options

00:11:45.084 --> 00:11:48.228
to live in better harmony
with these massive pachyderms.

00:11:48.252 --> 00:11:50.403
One of those issues
is to try and get farmers,

00:11:50.427 --> 00:11:51.649
and women in particular,

00:11:51.673 --> 00:11:53.863
to think different
about what they're planting

00:11:53.887 --> 00:11:55.188
inside their farms as well.

00:11:55.212 --> 00:11:56.860
So we're looking at planting crops

00:11:56.884 --> 00:11:59.764
that elephants don't particularly
want to eat, like chillies,

00:11:59.788 --> 00:12:02.061
ginger, Moringa, sunflowers.

00:12:02.085 --> 00:12:05.308
And of course, the bees and the beehive
fences love these crops too,

00:12:05.332 --> 00:12:07.117
because they have beautiful flowers.

00:12:07.141 --> 00:12:09.831
One of these plants
is a spiky plant called sisal --

00:12:09.855 --> 00:12:11.728
you may know this here as jute.

00:12:12.075 --> 00:12:14.591
And this amazing plant
can be stripped down

00:12:14.615 --> 00:12:16.956
and turned into a weaving product.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.052
We're working with these amazing women now

00:12:19.076 --> 00:12:21.742
who live daily with
the challenges of elephants

00:12:21.766 --> 00:12:24.735
to use this plant to weave into baskets

00:12:24.759 --> 00:12:27.307
to provide an alternative income for them.

00:12:27.696 --> 00:12:30.180
We've just started construction
only three weeks ago

00:12:30.204 --> 00:12:32.235
on a women's enterprise center

00:12:32.259 --> 00:12:34.577
where we're going to be working
with these women

00:12:34.601 --> 00:12:36.117
not only as expert beekeepers

00:12:36.141 --> 00:12:37.799
but as amazing basket weavers;

00:12:37.823 --> 00:12:40.934
they're going to be processing
chili oils, sunflower oils,

00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.903
making lip balms and honey,

00:12:42.927 --> 00:12:46.171
and we're somewhere on our way
to helping these participating farmers

00:12:46.195 --> 00:12:50.592
live with better eco-generating projects
that live and work better

00:12:50.616 --> 00:12:52.456
with living with elephants.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.203
So whether it's matriarchs

00:12:54.227 --> 00:12:57.291
or mothers or researchers like myself,

00:12:57.315 --> 00:12:59.905
I do see more women
coming to the forefront now

00:12:59.929 --> 00:13:03.974
to think differently and more boldly
about the challenges that we face.

00:13:04.481 --> 00:13:06.037
With more innovation,

00:13:06.061 --> 00:13:09.505
and perhaps with some more empathy
towards each other,

00:13:09.529 --> 00:13:12.942
I do believe we can move
from a state of conflict with elephants

00:13:12.966 --> 00:13:14.913
to true coexistence.

00:13:15.341 --> 00:13:16.500
Thank you.

00:13:16.524 --> 00:13:22.611
(Applause)
