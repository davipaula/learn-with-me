00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.659
In November 2015, 197 countries
came together in Paris

00:00:04.683 --> 00:00:06.159
and agreed to pursue efforts

00:00:06.183 --> 00:00:11.159
to limit the temperature increase
on our planet to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

00:00:11.183 --> 00:00:14.034
The Climate Action Tracker
monitors the climate commitments

00:00:14.058 --> 00:00:15.992
and actions of 36 countries,

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:20.284
totalling roughly 80 percent of today's
global greenhouse gas emissions.

00:00:20.308 --> 00:00:22.992
Here's the bad news:
those emissions are still rising

00:00:23.016 --> 00:00:27.242
and have already warmed the globe
by 1.1 degrees Celsius.

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:29.742
The tracker makes two problems clear.

00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.367
First, countries have not
set emissions targets

00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:35.742
ambitious enough to reach
the goals of the Paris Agreement.

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:39.451
Even if every country hit their targets,
the temperature would still increase

00:00:39.475 --> 00:00:43.117
by more than two degrees Celsius
over the next 70 years,

00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:47.534
and continue to rise
into the 22nd century and beyond.

00:00:47.558 --> 00:00:50.159
Second, governments
are simply not delivering

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:52.367
even on their unambitious targets.

00:00:52.391 --> 00:00:55.242
Everything these 36 countries
have done so far,

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.409
and everything
they are currently planning,

00:00:57.433 --> 00:00:59.992
will only slow the growth in emissions.

00:01:00.016 --> 00:01:01.951
We need to do more than that.

00:01:01.975 --> 00:01:05.201
To have a hope of limiting
global warming to 1.5 degrees,

00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:11.409
we need to cut global emissions in half
by 2030 and get to net zero by 2050.

00:01:11.433 --> 00:01:13.159
Let's go through the numbers.

00:01:13.183 --> 00:01:15.076
Of the 36 countries analyzed,

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.451
only two are taking enough action
to restrain global warming to 1.5 degrees.

00:01:20.475 --> 00:01:22.951
The Gambia has pledged
to reduce its emissions,

00:01:22.975 --> 00:01:25.159
despite being one of
the developing countries

00:01:25.183 --> 00:01:27.576
that has contributed least to the problem.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.826
And Morocco is building
more and more solar power.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.701
Every other country is failing.

00:01:33.725 --> 00:01:37.201
2020 is the year national governments
were supposed to come together

00:01:37.225 --> 00:01:39.076
and strengthen their targets.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.201
So far, only a few have done so
while others have announced

00:01:42.225 --> 00:01:45.576
they're sticking with their existing
insufficient targets.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.992
Now, some countries aren't
too far behind The Gambia and Morocco,

00:01:49.016 --> 00:01:50.909
such as India and Kenya.

00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:53.409
But the countries
with the most advanced economies,

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:56.492
those with the greatest capacity
to innovate and help others,

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:59.451
are shirking their
responsibilities to lead.

00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:02.992
The United States is currently
withdrawing from the Paris Agreement.

00:02:03.016 --> 00:02:04.326
China shows promise;

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.742
its pledge to balance out
its carbon emissions by 2060

00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:12.409
could save the world as much as
0.3 degrees Celsius of global warming.

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:15.326
But actions on the ground remain divided.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.242
China is the largest market
for wind and solar power,

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:21.867
but also for new coal-fired power plants.

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:24.492
And the EU is taking steps
in the right direction

00:02:24.516 --> 00:02:27.492
with its green deal to make
member countries more sustainable.

00:02:27.516 --> 00:02:30.850
But this deal is still
not enough for 1.5 degrees.

00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:33.742
So are there any signs of hope?

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:37.492
One key measure is a country's willingness
to clean up electricity.

00:02:37.516 --> 00:02:41.867
Clean power can enable other sectors
to reduce or eliminate emissions.

00:02:41.891 --> 00:02:47.034
More than 50 countries, 30 regions,
160 cities and 200 businesses

00:02:47.058 --> 00:02:50.909
have committed to
100 percent clean electricity.

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:53.576
Denmark, Scotland
and the state of South Australia

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.992
are almost there already,

00:02:55.016 --> 00:02:58.242
but much of the world still needs
to commit to, and accelerate,

00:02:58.266 --> 00:02:59.641
this energy transition.

00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:03.159
There's more good news
in the transportation sector.

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:07.367
More than 20 countries, five regions,
50 cities and 60 businesses

00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:11.034
have already committed
to 100 percent emission-free cars,

00:03:11.058 --> 00:03:13.076
motorcycles and buses.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.159
Norway is mandating the end of all sales
of fossil fuel cars by 2025.

00:03:18.183 --> 00:03:20.117
Meanwhile, the US is allowing companies

00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:23.076
to make cars that don't travel
as far on a gallon of gas,

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.909
rolling back fuel efficiency standards.

00:03:25.933 --> 00:03:28.367
Other sectors, such as steel
and cement-making

00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:29.909
or aviation and shipping,

00:03:29.933 --> 00:03:33.326
are even further behind
and trickier to clean up.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.076
But some steel and cement companies
are developing carbon-free production,

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.683
and Norway and Scotland are targeting
carbon-free short-haul flights.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.826
In November 2015, 197 countries
came together in Paris

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.451
and set targets to fight climate change.

00:03:48.475 --> 00:03:51.784
These targets were already insufficient
to reach the stated goal

00:03:51.808 --> 00:03:55.409
of limiting global warming
to 1.5 degrees Celsius,

00:03:55.433 --> 00:04:00.034
and most are not on track to achieve
even their own inadequate targets.

00:04:00.058 --> 00:04:04.284
We need more ambitious targets
and much more ambitious actions.

00:04:04.308 --> 00:04:08.367
In the next decade, we need to transform
key sectors of the global economy

00:04:08.391 --> 00:04:10.617
in order to reduce emissions.

00:04:10.641 --> 00:04:13.117
These changes will be difficult
but not impossible,

00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:15.909
because they will also bring
enormous opportunities

00:04:15.933 --> 00:04:18.201
like creating millions of jobs.

00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:20.784
And don't lose track of this key point:

00:04:20.808 --> 00:04:23.534
such a transformation
will also mean cleaner air

00:04:23.558 --> 00:04:26.058
and a safer, more stable climate for all.
