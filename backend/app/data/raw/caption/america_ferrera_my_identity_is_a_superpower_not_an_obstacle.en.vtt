00:00:12.917 --> 00:00:16.059
On the red tiles in my family's den

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:20.226
I would dance and sing
to the made-for-TV movie "Gypsy,"

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.393
starring Bette Midler.

00:00:22.417 --> 00:00:24.976
(Singing) "I had a dream.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.893
A wonderful dream, papa."

00:00:28.917 --> 00:00:33.559
I would sing it with the urgency
and the burning desire of a nine-year-old

00:00:33.583 --> 00:00:36.684
who did, in fact, have a dream.

00:00:36.708 --> 00:00:40.476
My dream was to be an actress.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.851
And it's true that I never saw
anyone who looked like me

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:45.393
in television or in films,

00:00:45.417 --> 00:00:50.518
and sure, my family and friends
and teachers all constantly warned me

00:00:50.542 --> 00:00:54.417
that people like me
didn't make it in Hollywood.

00:00:56.417 --> 00:00:58.601
But I was an American.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:03.059
I had been taught to believe
that anyone could achieve anything,

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:06.518
regardless of the color of their skin,

00:01:06.542 --> 00:01:09.309
the fact that my parents
immigrated from Honduras,

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.500
the fact that I had no money.

00:01:12.583 --> 00:01:15.768
I didn't need my dream to be easy,

00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:18.167
I just needed it to be possible.

00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:21.333
And when I was 15,

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:26.226
I got my first professional audition.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.768
It was a commercial
for cable subscriptions

00:01:29.792 --> 00:01:31.934
or bail bonds, I don't really remember.

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:33.101
(Laughter)

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:36.750
What I do remember
is that the casting director asked me,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.458
"Could you do that again,
but just this time, sound more Latina."

00:01:44.917 --> 00:01:47.226
"Um, OK.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.934
So you want me
to do it in Spanish?" I asked.

00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:54.583
"No, no, do it in English,
just sound Latina."

00:01:56.917 --> 00:02:02.375
"Well, I am a Latina,
so isn't this what a Latina sounds like?"

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.934
There was a long and awkward silence,

00:02:05.958 --> 00:02:07.476
and then finally,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.101
"OK, sweetie, never mind,
thank you for coming in, bye!"

00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:15.726
It took me most of the car ride home
to realize that by "sound more Latina"

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.059
she was asking me
to speak in broken English.

00:02:19.083 --> 00:02:21.101
And I couldn't figure out why the fact

00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:26.476
that I was an actual,
real-life, authentic Latina

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.309
didn't really seem to matter.

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:30.184
Anyway, I didn't get the job.

00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:34.018
I didn't get a lot of the jobs
people were willing to see me for:

00:02:34.042 --> 00:02:36.476
the gang-banger's girlfriend,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.268
the sassy shoplifter,

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:41.601
pregnant chola number two.

00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:43.143
(Laughter)

00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:47.476
These were the kinds of roles
that existed for someone like me.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.809
Someone they looked at
and saw as too brown, too fat,

00:02:51.833 --> 00:02:55.559
too poor, too unsophisticated.

00:02:55.583 --> 00:02:57.559
These roles were stereotypes

00:02:57.583 --> 00:03:01.226
and couldn't have been further
from my own reality

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.851
or from the roles I dreamt of playing.

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:07.809
I wanted to play people
who were complex and multidimensional,

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:11.768
people who existed in the center
of their own lives.

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:16.518
Not cardboard cutouts that stood
in the background of someone else's.

00:03:16.542 --> 00:03:19.434
But when I dared to say that
to my manager --

00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:23.143
that's the person I pay
to help me find opportunity --

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:26.184
his response was,

00:03:26.208 --> 00:03:31.625
"Someone has to tell that girl
she has unrealistic expectations."

00:03:33.625 --> 00:03:35.684
And he wasn't wrong.

00:03:35.708 --> 00:03:38.143
I mean, I fired him, but he wasn't wrong.

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:40.309
(Laughter)

00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:44.934
(Applause)

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:50.143
Because whenever I did try to get a role
that wasn't a poorly written stereotype,

00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:51.434
I would hear,

00:03:51.458 --> 00:03:54.559
"We're not looking
to cast this role diversely."

00:03:54.583 --> 00:03:59.101
Or, "We love her,
but she's too specifically ethnic."

00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:04.000
Or, "Unfortunately, we already have
one Latino in this movie."

00:04:05.125 --> 00:04:10.250
I kept receiving the same message
again and again and again.

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:16.750
That my identity was an obstacle
I had to overcome.

00:04:18.167 --> 00:04:20.684
And so I thought,

00:04:20.708 --> 00:04:22.518
"Come at me, obstacle.

00:04:22.542 --> 00:04:26.893
I'm an American. My name is America.

00:04:26.917 --> 00:04:31.142
I trained my whole life for this,
I'll just follow the playbook,

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:32.892
I'll work harder."

00:04:32.916 --> 00:04:35.559
And so I did, I worked my hardest

00:04:35.583 --> 00:04:39.351
to overcome all the things
that people said were wrong with me.

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:42.684
I stayed out of the sun
so that my skin wouldn't get too brown,

00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:46.684
I straightened my curls into submission.

00:04:46.708 --> 00:04:48.559
I constantly tried to lose weight,

00:04:48.583 --> 00:04:51.309
I bought fancier
and more expensive clothes.

00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:53.226
All so that when people looked at me,

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.458
they wouldn't see a too fat,
too brown, too poor Latina.

00:04:59.708 --> 00:05:02.393
They would see what I was capable of.

00:05:02.417 --> 00:05:05.042
And maybe they would give me a chance.

00:05:07.792 --> 00:05:11.684
And in an ironic twist of fate,

00:05:11.708 --> 00:05:16.458
when I finally did get a role
that would make all my dreams come true,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.208
it was a role that required me
to be exactly who I was.

00:05:23.167 --> 00:05:26.559
Ana in "Real Women Have Curves"

00:05:26.583 --> 00:05:30.417
was a brown, poor, fat Latina.

00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:36.518
I had never seen anyone
like her, anyone like me,

00:05:36.542 --> 00:05:40.934
existing in the center
of her own life story.

00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:42.851
I traveled throughout the US

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:45.101
and to multiple countries with this film

00:05:45.125 --> 00:05:50.559
where people, regardless of their age,
ethnicity, body type,

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:53.143
saw themselves in Ana.

00:05:53.167 --> 00:05:56.976
A 17-year-old chubby Mexican American girl

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.750
struggling against cultural norms
to fulfill her unlikely dream.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.268
In spite of what
I had been told my whole life,

00:06:06.292 --> 00:06:12.559
I saw firsthand that people actually did
want to see stories about people like me.

00:06:12.583 --> 00:06:15.809
And that my unrealistic expectations

00:06:15.833 --> 00:06:19.893
to see myself authentically
represented in the culture

00:06:19.917 --> 00:06:22.125
were other peopleâ€™s expectations, too.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.726
"Real Women Have Curves"

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.559
was a critical, cultural
and financial success.

00:06:29.583 --> 00:06:32.792
"Great," I thought, "We did it!

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.518
We proved our stories have value.

00:06:36.542 --> 00:06:39.375
Things are going to change now."

00:06:42.042 --> 00:06:44.976
But I watched as very little happened.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.101
There was no watershed.

00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:50.726
No one in the industry
was rushing to tell more stories

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.625
about the audience that was hungry
and willing to pay to see them.

00:06:58.792 --> 00:07:02.750
Four years later,
when I got to play Ugly Betty,

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.851
I saw the same phenomenon play out.

00:07:06.875 --> 00:07:10.976
"Ugly Betty" premiered in the US
to 16 million viewers

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.208
and was nominated
for 11 Emmys in its first year.

00:07:16.792 --> 00:07:21.226
(Applause)

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.601
But in spite of "Ugly Betty's" success,

00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:29.059
there would not be another television show

00:07:29.083 --> 00:07:31.434
led by a Latina actress

00:07:31.458 --> 00:07:34.083
on American television for eight years.

00:07:36.667 --> 00:07:38.601
It's been 12 years

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:42.226
since I became the first and only Latina

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.208
to ever win an Emmy in a lead category.

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:48.684
That is not a point of pride.

00:07:48.708 --> 00:07:51.226
That is a point of deep frustration.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.018
Not because awards prove our worth,

00:07:54.042 --> 00:07:57.851
but because who we see
thriving in the world

00:07:57.875 --> 00:08:00.601
teaches us how to see ourselves,

00:08:00.625 --> 00:08:03.226
how to think about our own value,

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.934
how to dream about our futures.

00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.893
And anytime I begin to doubt that,

00:08:07.917 --> 00:08:13.018
I remember that there was a little girl,
living in the Swat Valley of Pakistan.

00:08:13.042 --> 00:08:15.934
And somehow, she got
her hands on some DVDs

00:08:15.958 --> 00:08:17.934
of an American television show

00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:21.708
in which she saw her own dream
of becoming a writer reflected.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.768
In her autobiography, Malala wrote,

00:08:26.792 --> 00:08:28.643
"I had become interested in journalism

00:08:28.667 --> 00:08:32.018
after seeing how my own words
could make a difference

00:08:32.042 --> 00:08:36.018
and also from watching
the "Ugly Betty" DVDs

00:08:36.042 --> 00:08:39.059
about life at an American magazine."

00:08:39.083 --> 00:08:46.143
(Applause)

00:08:46.167 --> 00:08:49.893
For 17 years of my career,

00:08:49.917 --> 00:08:55.183
I have witnessed the power our voices have

00:08:55.207 --> 00:08:58.250
when they can access
presence in the culture.

00:08:59.292 --> 00:09:00.934
I've seen it.

00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:03.684
I've lived it, we've all seen it.

00:09:03.708 --> 00:09:06.893
In entertainment, in politics,

00:09:06.917 --> 00:09:10.726
in business, in social change.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:15.375
We cannot deny it --
presence creates possibility.

00:09:16.917 --> 00:09:18.934
But for the last 17 years,

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.726
I've also heard the same excuses

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.643
for why some of us can access
presence in the culture

00:09:25.667 --> 00:09:27.208
and some of us can't.

00:09:29.042 --> 00:09:30.768
Our stories don't have an audience,

00:09:30.792 --> 00:09:34.184
our experiences won't resonate
in the mainstream,

00:09:34.208 --> 00:09:37.958
our voices are too big a financial risk.

00:09:39.625 --> 00:09:42.226
Just a few years ago, my agent called

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.226
to explain to me why
I wasn't getting a role in a movie.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.226
He said, "They loved you

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.893
and they really, really do want
to cast diversely,

00:09:50.917 --> 00:09:56.417
but the movie isn't financeable
until they cast the white role first."

00:09:58.708 --> 00:10:01.393
He delivered the message
with a broken heart

00:10:01.417 --> 00:10:05.250
and with a tone that communicated,
"I understand how messed up this is."

00:10:06.667 --> 00:10:12.601
But nonetheless, just like
hundreds of times before,

00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:14.875
I felt the tears roll down my face.

00:10:15.875 --> 00:10:19.934
And the pang of rejection rise up in me

00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.268
and then the voice of shame scolding me,

00:10:22.292 --> 00:10:25.833
"You are a grown woman,
stop crying over a job."

00:10:27.208 --> 00:10:31.268
I went through this process for years
of accepting the failure as my own

00:10:31.292 --> 00:10:35.333
and then feeling deep shame
that I couldn't overcome the obstacles.

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:38.458
But this time, I heard a new voice.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.792
A voice that said, "I'm tired.

00:10:43.917 --> 00:10:45.559
I've had enough."

00:10:45.583 --> 00:10:47.184
A voice that understood

00:10:47.208 --> 00:10:51.500
my tears and my pain
were not about losing a job.

00:10:52.417 --> 00:10:56.101
They were about what
was actually being said about me.

00:10:56.125 --> 00:11:00.018
What had been said about me my whole life

00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:03.018
by executives and producers

00:11:03.042 --> 00:11:06.059
and directors and writers
and agents and managers

00:11:06.083 --> 00:11:09.018
and teachers and friends and family.

00:11:09.042 --> 00:11:11.667
That I was a person of less value.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.351
I thought sunscreen
and straightening irons

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:20.458
would bring about change
in this deeply entrenched value system.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.434
But what I realized in that moment

00:11:25.458 --> 00:11:31.226
was that I was never actually asking
the system to change.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:36.833
I was asking it to let me in,
and those aren't the same thing.

00:11:38.375 --> 00:11:41.393
I couldn't change
what a system believed about me,

00:11:41.417 --> 00:11:44.417
while I believed what
the system believed about me.

00:11:45.458 --> 00:11:46.934
And I did.

00:11:46.958 --> 00:11:48.851
I, like everyone around me,

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:54.625
believed that it wasn't possible
for me to exist in my dream as I was.

00:11:55.625 --> 00:11:59.250
And I went about
trying to make myself invisible.

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:06.684
What this revealed to me
was that it is possible

00:12:06.708 --> 00:12:11.726
to be the person
who genuinely wants to see change

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:17.667
while also being the person whose actions
keep things the way they are.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.059
And what it's led me to believe
is that change isn't going to come

00:12:24.083 --> 00:12:27.018
by identifying the good guys
and the bad guys.

00:12:27.042 --> 00:12:29.851
That conversation
lets us all off the hook.

00:12:29.875 --> 00:12:32.375
Because most of us
are neither one of those.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.101
Change will come

00:12:35.125 --> 00:12:37.059
when each of us has the courage

00:12:37.083 --> 00:12:41.309
to question our own fundamental
values and beliefs.

00:12:41.333 --> 00:12:46.542
And then see to it that our actions
lead to our best intentions.

00:12:48.542 --> 00:12:51.601
I am just one of millions of people

00:12:51.625 --> 00:12:55.476
who have been told
that in order to fulfill my dreams,

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.684
in order to contribute
my talents to the world

00:12:57.708 --> 00:13:00.833
I have to resist the truth of who I am.

00:13:02.042 --> 00:13:05.851
I for one, am ready to stop resisting

00:13:05.875 --> 00:13:10.625
and to start existing
as my full and authentic self.

00:13:12.417 --> 00:13:15.059
If I could go back and say anything

00:13:15.083 --> 00:13:19.559
to that nine-year-old,
dancing in the den, dreaming her dreams,

00:13:19.583 --> 00:13:21.101
I would say,

00:13:21.125 --> 00:13:23.250
my identity is not my obstacle.

00:13:24.292 --> 00:13:26.250
My identity is my superpower.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.601
Because the truth is,

00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:31.708
I am what the world looks like.

00:13:32.667 --> 00:13:35.643
You are what the world looks like.

00:13:35.667 --> 00:13:40.768
Collectively, we are
what the world actually looks like.

00:13:40.792 --> 00:13:43.893
And in order for our systems
to reflect that,

00:13:43.917 --> 00:13:46.875
they don't have to create a new reality.

00:13:47.833 --> 00:13:51.375
They just have to stop
resisting the one we already live in.

00:13:52.667 --> 00:13:53.934
Thank you.

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:58.458
(Applause)
