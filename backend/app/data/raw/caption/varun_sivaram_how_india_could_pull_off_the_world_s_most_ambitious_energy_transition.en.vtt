00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:16.893
The air smelled smoky and sulfurous.

00:00:16.917 --> 00:00:19.726
I just stepped off
a rickety train to Korba,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.018
deep in the Indian state of Chhattisgarh,

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:24.476
and home to a dozen coal power plants

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.309
and India's largest open-pit coal mine.

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.601
There it is,

00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:30.309
a literal hellscape,

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:34.143
complete with infernal
fires that burn 24/7.

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:37.476
But, in Korba, coal is life.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.101
Most people I talked to accepted

00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:42.101
that the coal economy
powers their livelihoods,

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:43.976
but it is slowly killing them.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.934
Here's a community
next door to a coal plant.

00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:50.851
They wake every morning
to homes coated in a fresh layer of ash

00:00:50.875 --> 00:00:52.976
from the smoke that the plant belches.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.059
Korba is one of the most critically
polluted places on the planet.

00:00:57.083 --> 00:00:59.643
And it's not just
coal country that's hurting,

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:03.684
all of India has a deadly
addiction to fossil fuels.

00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:08.101
India's home to 22 of the world's
30 most polluted places on the planet.

00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:09.726
In Delhi, the capital,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.101
residents lose 9.4 years
off their life expectancy on average.

00:01:14.125 --> 00:01:19.059
In 2020, the skies briefly cleared
during the coronavirus lockdown,

00:01:19.083 --> 00:01:21.934
as cars stayed off the roads,
factories shuttered

00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.226
and power plants ramped down.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.893
But the economic dislocation

00:01:25.917 --> 00:01:30.934
has put 400 million Indians
at risk of falling deeper into poverty.

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:35.393
India should not have to sacrifice
development for breathable air.

00:01:35.417 --> 00:01:37.309
There is a better way.

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:42.167
For India has a historic opportunity
to industrialize using clean energy.

00:01:43.167 --> 00:01:46.143
That opportunity is why I moved
halfway around the world

00:01:46.167 --> 00:01:48.601
from the US to India to join ReNew Power,

00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:52.101
India's largest renewable
energy company, as CTO.

00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:54.643
After two years
of crisscrossing the country,

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:56.559
I've seen green shoots everywhere,

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:58.684
of a budding clean energy boom,

00:01:58.708 --> 00:02:00.059
daring me to hope

00:02:00.083 --> 00:02:04.476
that India can pull off the world's
most important energy transition.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.684
Its choices will make or break
the world's fight against climate change,

00:02:08.708 --> 00:02:12.434
for if India chooses fossil fuels
to power its growing economy,

00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:14.184
its carbon emissions could explode,

00:02:14.208 --> 00:02:17.375
making it the world's number one
emitter later this century.

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:22.476
Still, for most Indians
fossil fuels are a luxury.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.934
Most live in rural areas,

00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.934
and wood, cow dung and bioenergy sources

00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:29.434
account for two-thirds
of household energy use.

00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:31.351
Just six percent of Indians own cars,

00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:33.393
and two percent have air conditioning.

00:02:33.417 --> 00:02:35.476
Indians will need far more energy

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.601
to escape poverty and live
modern, dignified lifestyles.

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:41.809
By 2050 most will live in cities,

00:02:41.833 --> 00:02:44.476
and they'll want to drive
to work and cool their homes.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.726
Along the way, India will become
the world's most populous country,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.476
home to 1.6 billion people by mid-century.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.851
Its economy could multiply tenfold;

00:02:52.875 --> 00:02:55.601
its energy needs could quadruple.

00:02:55.625 --> 00:03:00.143
Today, coal, oil and gas
supply three-quarters of India's energy,

00:03:00.167 --> 00:03:04.476
producing electricity, fueling vehicles
and powering India's factories.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.726
If, by 2050, India still gets
the same proportion from fossil fuels,

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.601
it'll be a disaster for everyone,

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:13.726
not least local populations,

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.167
vulnerable to pollution, climate change
or rapacious new coal mining.

00:03:19.292 --> 00:03:26.143
Instead, India can make renewable energy
the beating heart of a reimagined economy

00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:29.726
by achieving three audacious goals
all at the same time.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.643
It's a route no country
in history has ever taken,

00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:34.268
but it is possible,

00:03:34.292 --> 00:03:36.934
and this moment demands it.

00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.809
First, India will need to
build solar and wind power

00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:43.143
at an unprecedented scale and speed,

00:03:43.167 --> 00:03:45.976
replacing coal-fired power plants.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.434
Second, India will need to extend
the reach of that renewable energy

00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:52.809
to power sectors of the economy
like industry and transportation

00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:55.309
that haven't traditionally
used electricity.

00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:59.768
And third, India must become
radically more energy-efficient.

00:03:59.792 --> 00:04:03.059
Here's my plan to achieve all three goals.

00:04:03.083 --> 00:04:07.518
First, India must build thousands
of gigawatts of solar and wind power.

00:04:07.542 --> 00:04:08.893
To put this in context,

00:04:08.917 --> 00:04:12.268
it will be more than enough
renewable energy to power all of America.

00:04:12.292 --> 00:04:15.768
Fortunately, India is blessed
with abundant sunshine.

00:04:15.792 --> 00:04:18.268
In theory, you could supply
all of its energy needs

00:04:18.292 --> 00:04:19.601
by tapping the sunlight

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:24.059
that shines on less than 10 percent
of India's wastelands.

00:04:24.083 --> 00:04:27.059
India also has substantial
untapped wind potential

00:04:27.083 --> 00:04:29.226
on land and offshore.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.184
Wind and solar complement each other

00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:33.976
because the wind often blows harder
when it's less sunny,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.268
like during the monsoon rains.

00:04:36.292 --> 00:04:38.768
Here's some even more exciting news:

00:04:38.792 --> 00:04:42.934
Wind and solar power
are now cheaper than coal power,

00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:45.351
and it costs less
to build a solar farm in India

00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:47.643
than anywhere else in the world.

00:04:47.667 --> 00:04:49.934
Batteries have also
become dramatically cheaper,

00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:53.309
making it possible to store
and deliver energy on demand.

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:56.851
Thanks to falling costs,
renewable energy has risen rapidly,

00:04:56.875 --> 00:04:59.268
but it will need to grow
even more explosively

00:04:59.292 --> 00:05:00.559
through mid-century.

00:05:00.583 --> 00:05:04.726
This is the critical decade
to invest in solar and wind power

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.101
and avoid locking in
new, long-lived coal power plants.

00:05:09.125 --> 00:05:11.726
India must also urgently expand its grid

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.809
to deliver power for massive
solar and wind plants

00:05:14.833 --> 00:05:18.851
in the sun-soaked deserts of Rajasthan
or the windy coast of Gujarat,

00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:21.601
to energy-hungry cities like Mumbai.

00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:24.351
Not all renewables
should be built at massive scale.

00:05:24.375 --> 00:05:25.643
Distributed solar,

00:05:25.667 --> 00:05:29.559
on the rooftops of warehouses
or the outskirts of sprawling cities,

00:05:29.583 --> 00:05:32.101
can produce power
close to where it's needed.

00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:35.226
Now, to be sure, nuclear and hydropower

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.309
will be essential to energy
transitions around the world.

00:05:39.333 --> 00:05:42.518
But India simply lacks
the state capacity needed

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:46.268
to build complex pricey projects
at a breakneck pace,

00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:49.809
and all that push to build
renewable wind and solar power

00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:53.226
best plays to India's strengths.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.393
The second audacious goal

00:05:55.417 --> 00:05:58.393
is to use renewable energy
across the economy,

00:05:58.417 --> 00:06:01.643
including in sectors
like industry and transportation

00:06:01.667 --> 00:06:04.393
that don't use electricity today.

00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:07.476
As rising renewable energy
makes the power grid cleaner,

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.351
India should make
all of its trains run on electricity

00:06:10.375 --> 00:06:14.518
and move more heavy freight
from heavy trucks to rail.

00:06:14.542 --> 00:06:17.434
India's road vehicle fleet
can also go electric.

00:06:17.458 --> 00:06:18.726
Now, to be clear,

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.143
we're mostly not talking
about these electric vehicles,

00:06:22.167 --> 00:06:23.976
but these.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.518
Two- and three-wheelers

00:06:25.542 --> 00:06:28.768
make up more than 80 percent
of India's vehicle fleet.

00:06:28.792 --> 00:06:32.184
To accelerate the adoption
of electric scooters and rickshaws,

00:06:32.208 --> 00:06:34.476
India should build out charging stations

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.476
and beef up local power grids

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.768
to handle the influx
of electricity demand.

00:06:39.792 --> 00:06:43.309
Still, electrification
won't work everywhere.

00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:48.601
It may not be possible to use electricity
to power some heavy industrial processes

00:06:48.625 --> 00:06:53.184
in the fast-growing steel, cement,
fertilizer and petrochemical sectors.

00:06:53.208 --> 00:06:54.732
Plants may need to add equipment

00:06:54.756 --> 00:06:58.268
to capture carbon emissions
from burning fossil fuels.

00:06:58.292 --> 00:07:01.518
Another solution could be clean hydrogen.

00:07:01.542 --> 00:07:06.018
Surplus renewable electricity
can run machines called electrolyzers

00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:10.726
that can split water into oxygen
and green hydrogen fuel.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.934
That hydrogen can then power applications
in transportation and industry,

00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:17.143
such as making steel or chemicals.

00:07:17.167 --> 00:07:19.476
Hydrogen can also act
as a sort of battery,

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.309
storing surplus wind
and solar power to be used later.

00:07:23.333 --> 00:07:28.226
Finally, the third goal
is to radically improve energy efficiency.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.101
If there's any country in the world
where efficiency is all-important,

00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:33.393
it's India.

00:07:33.417 --> 00:07:36.226
Even if India builds a massive
supply of renewable energy

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.893
and extends the reach of that energy
by stitching together its economy,

00:07:39.917 --> 00:07:42.934
it won't be enough
without energy efficiency.

00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.476
Because if India's voracious demand
for energy rises too quickly,

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.143
it'll have to fill the gap
with polluting fossil fuels.

00:07:50.167 --> 00:07:51.559
Here's a crazy statistic:

00:07:51.583 --> 00:07:54.101
Just to power the insane
demand for air conditioning,

00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:57.030
India will need to add
70 percent of the power system capacity

00:07:57.054 --> 00:07:59.268
of all of Europe today.

00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:01.476
And because much of India
is hot and humid,

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.184
air conditioning demand
will peak during sweaty nights,

00:08:04.208 --> 00:08:07.393
making it tough for solar to power ACs.

00:08:07.417 --> 00:08:11.059
But far more efficient air conditioners
could make it possible

00:08:11.083 --> 00:08:13.851
to power the aspirations
of a rising middle class

00:08:13.875 --> 00:08:15.601
with renewable energy.

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:19.726
India's big advantage
is that it's largely a clean slate.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.684
An incredible 70 percent
of India's infrastructure in 2030

00:08:22.708 --> 00:08:24.851
hasn't been built yet.

00:08:24.875 --> 00:08:30.184
That presents a huge opportunity
to enact stringent efficiency standards

00:08:30.208 --> 00:08:33.226
and design energy-efficient
buildings and cities.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.226
Still, there are warning signs

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:40.059
that India's energy transition
could sputter out.

00:08:40.083 --> 00:08:42.309
COVID-19 sharply slowed

00:08:42.333 --> 00:08:44.934
the building of new
renewable energy plants.

00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.851
Even larger challenges loom.

00:08:46.875 --> 00:08:50.476
First, India's electricity
distribution utilities

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.018
are mismanaged, economically fragile

00:08:53.042 --> 00:08:54.934
and forced by many states

00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:58.351
to subsidize power to farmers
and residential customers.

00:08:58.375 --> 00:08:59.726
India needs reforms

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.684
to more efficiently combat energy poverty

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:07.976
while overhauling unprofitable utilities
so they can pay for clean energy on time.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.101
Doing so will make it possible

00:09:10.125 --> 00:09:13.643
to raise trillions of dollars
at home and abroad

00:09:13.667 --> 00:09:16.393
to finance India's
clean energy transition.

00:09:16.417 --> 00:09:21.018
Second, that transition will stall
without new and improved technologies.

00:09:21.042 --> 00:09:22.684
Here's an economic opportunity

00:09:22.708 --> 00:09:26.351
for India to cultivate
advanced clean energy industries.

00:09:26.375 --> 00:09:30.018
In the future, India
should manufacture and export

00:09:30.042 --> 00:09:31.684
energy-efficient air conditioners,

00:09:31.708 --> 00:09:33.393
electric two- and three-wheelers

00:09:33.417 --> 00:09:35.893
and equipment to produce and use hydrogen.

00:09:35.917 --> 00:09:38.851
India's already strong
in wind power manufacturing,

00:09:38.875 --> 00:09:42.809
and it could become a global leader
in digital energy technologies.

00:09:42.833 --> 00:09:44.786
The international community can help here

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.715
by funding innovation to make
India's energy transition faster

00:09:47.739 --> 00:09:48.976
and more affordable.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.809
Countries like the United States

00:09:50.833 --> 00:09:54.476
should help fund public procurement
of advanced air conditioners

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.934
and partner to build projects
on the ground in India

00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.059
that demonstrate critical technologies,

00:09:59.083 --> 00:10:03.018
such as long-duration energy storage
and carbon capture.

00:10:03.042 --> 00:10:06.643
Finally, coal isn't going away
without a fight.

00:10:06.667 --> 00:10:08.768
It's big business in India.

00:10:08.792 --> 00:10:11.434
Near Korba, India's coal capital,

00:10:11.458 --> 00:10:15.268
private companies are pushing ahead
to expand coal mining,

00:10:15.292 --> 00:10:19.768
even deforesting an elephant preserve
to dig out the coal underneath.

00:10:19.792 --> 00:10:22.768
I witnessed the destruction firsthand.

00:10:22.792 --> 00:10:27.351
But for every Korba there is a Kutch.

00:10:27.375 --> 00:10:30.393
In this wind-swept
region of Gujarat, I gaped

00:10:30.417 --> 00:10:33.518
as construction crews
hoisted 70-ton nacelles

00:10:33.542 --> 00:10:36.601
atop towers taller
than a football field is long.

00:10:36.625 --> 00:10:39.059
The wind turbine blades
are manufactured in India,

00:10:39.083 --> 00:10:41.268
and the electricity
they'll go on to generate

00:10:41.292 --> 00:10:43.393
will help power economic growth.

00:10:43.417 --> 00:10:47.476
Renewable energy offers India
a cleaner and more prosperous future

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.476
than coal ever can.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.809
Unless we hasten the transition,

00:10:51.833 --> 00:10:55.976
air pollution and climate change
will continue to ravage the country

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.143
and endanger the planet.

00:10:58.167 --> 00:11:01.184
So, let's get to work.

00:11:01.208 --> 00:11:02.458
Thank you.
