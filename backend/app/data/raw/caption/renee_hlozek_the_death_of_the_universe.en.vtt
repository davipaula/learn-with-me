00:00:06.494 --> 00:00:07.890
Looking up at the night sky,

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.910
we are amazed by how it seems to go on forever.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.395
But what will the sky look like

00:00:12.395 --> 00:00:13.865
billions of years from now?

00:00:13.865 --> 00:00:15.372
A particular type of scientist,

00:00:15.372 --> 00:00:16.616
called a cosmologist,

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:19.531
spends her time thinking about that very question.

00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:21.924
The end of the universe is intimately linked

00:00:21.924 --> 00:00:23.868
to what the universe contains.

00:00:23.868 --> 00:00:25.170
Over 100 years ago,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.879
Einstein developed the Theory of General Relativity,

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:29.923
formed of equations that help us

00:00:29.923 --> 00:00:31.258
understand the relationship

00:00:31.258 --> 00:00:33.462
between what a universe is made of

00:00:33.462 --> 00:00:34.511
and its shape.

00:00:34.511 --> 00:00:36.124
It turns out that the universe

00:00:36.124 --> 00:00:38.178
could be curved like a ball or sphere.

00:00:38.178 --> 00:00:40.676
We call this positively curved or closed.

00:00:40.676 --> 00:00:42.228
Or it could be shaped like a saddle.

00:00:42.228 --> 00:00:44.488
We call this negatively curved or open.

00:00:44.488 --> 00:00:46.033
Or it could be flat.

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:47.155
And that shape determines

00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:49.537
how the universe will live and die.

00:00:49.537 --> 00:00:52.632
We now know that the universe is very close to flat.

00:00:52.632 --> 00:00:54.338
However, the components of the universe

00:00:54.338 --> 00:00:56.454
can still affect its eventual fate.

00:00:56.454 --> 00:00:58.033
We can predict how the universe

00:00:58.033 --> 00:00:59.611
will change with time

00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:01.793
if we measure the amounts or energy densities

00:01:01.793 --> 00:01:04.588
of the various components in the universe today.

00:01:04.588 --> 00:01:06.727
So, what is the universe made of?

00:01:06.727 --> 00:01:09.393
The universe contains all the things that we can see,

00:01:09.393 --> 00:01:11.564
like stars, gas, and planets.

00:01:11.564 --> 00:01:14.733
We call these things ordinary or baryonic matter.

00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:16.593
Even though we see them all around us,

00:01:16.593 --> 00:01:18.702
the total energy density of these components

00:01:18.702 --> 00:01:20.440
is actually very small,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.530
around 5% of the total energy of the universe.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.675
So, now let's talk about what the other 95% is.

00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:29.081
Just under 27% of the rest

00:01:29.081 --> 00:01:30.913
of the energy density of the universe

00:01:30.913 --> 00:01:33.825
is made up of what we call dark matter.

00:01:33.825 --> 00:01:36.928
Dark matter is only very weakly interacting with light,

00:01:36.928 --> 00:01:39.208
which means it doesn't shine or reflect light

00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:41.191
in the way that stars and planets do,

00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:42.288
but, in every other way,

00:01:42.288 --> 00:01:44.259
it behaves like ordinary matter --

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.128
it attracts things gravitationally.

00:01:46.128 --> 00:01:48.761
In fact, the only way we can detect this dark matter

00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:51.052
is through this gravitational interaction,

00:01:51.052 --> 00:01:52.343
how things orbit around it

00:01:52.343 --> 00:01:53.595
and how it bends light

00:01:53.595 --> 00:01:56.008
as it curves the space around it.

00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:58.343
We have yet to discover a dark matter particle,

00:01:58.343 --> 00:02:00.815
but scientists all over the world are searching

00:02:00.815 --> 00:02:02.950
for this elusive particle or particles

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.843
and the effects of dark matter on the universe.

00:02:05.843 --> 00:02:08.256
But this still doesn't add up to 100%.

00:02:08.256 --> 00:02:09.784
The remaining 68%

00:02:09.784 --> 00:02:11.680
of the energy density of the universe

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.759
is made up of dark energy,

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:16.457
which is even more mysterious than dark matter.

00:02:16.457 --> 00:02:18.422
This dark energy doesn't behave

00:02:18.422 --> 00:02:20.590
like any other substance we know at all

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.013
and acts more like anti-gravity force.

00:02:23.013 --> 00:02:25.420
We say that it has a gravitational pressure,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.330
which ordinary matter and dark matter do not.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.213
Instead of pulling the universe together,

00:02:30.213 --> 00:02:32.004
as we would expect gravity to do,

00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:34.287
the universe appears to be expanding apart

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:36.110
at an ever-increasing rate.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.938
The leading idea for dark energy

00:02:37.938 --> 00:02:40.148
is that it is a cosmological constant.

00:02:40.148 --> 00:02:42.245
That means it has the strange property

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:45.434
that it expands as the volume of space increases

00:02:45.434 --> 00:02:47.606
to keep its energy density constant.

00:02:47.606 --> 00:02:49.441
So, as the universe expands

00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:50.772
as it is doing right now,

00:02:50.772 --> 00:02:52.742
there will be more and more dark energy.

00:02:52.742 --> 00:02:54.574
Dark matter and baryonic matter,

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:55.277
on the other hand,

00:02:55.277 --> 00:02:56.622
don't expand with the universe

00:02:56.622 --> 00:02:58.409
and become more diluted.

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:59.335
Because of this property

00:02:59.335 --> 00:03:00.694
of the cosmological constant,

00:03:00.694 --> 00:03:03.451
the future universe will be more and more dominated

00:03:03.451 --> 00:03:04.592
by dark energy,

00:03:04.592 --> 00:03:06.330
becoming colder and colder

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.715
and expanding faster and faster.

00:03:08.715 --> 00:03:10.736
Eventually, the universe will run out of gas

00:03:10.736 --> 00:03:11.842
to form stars,

00:03:11.842 --> 00:03:13.941
and the stars themselves will run out of fuel

00:03:13.941 --> 00:03:15.192
and burn out,

00:03:15.192 --> 00:03:18.062
leaving the universe with only black holes in it.

00:03:18.062 --> 00:03:19.255
Given enough time,

00:03:19.255 --> 00:03:21.610
even these black holes will evaporate,

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.523
leaving a universe that is completely cold and empty.

00:03:24.523 --> 00:03:28.127
That is what we call the heat death of the universe.

00:03:28.127 --> 00:03:29.569
While it might sound depressing

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:30.694
living in a universe

00:03:30.694 --> 00:03:32.735
that will end its lifetime cold

00:03:32.735 --> 00:03:34.237
and devoid of life,

00:03:34.237 --> 00:03:36.027
the end fate of our universe

00:03:36.027 --> 00:03:37.937
actually has a beautiful symmetry

00:03:37.937 --> 00:03:40.087
to its hot, fiery beginning.

00:03:40.087 --> 00:03:41.998
We call the accelerating end state

00:03:41.998 --> 00:03:44.111
of the universe a de Sitter phase,

00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:46.082
named after the Dutch mathematician

00:03:46.082 --> 00:03:47.927
Willem de Sitter.

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:49.685
However, we also believe

00:03:49.685 --> 00:03:51.520
that the universe had another phase

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.831
of de Sitter expansion

00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:54.607
in the earliest times of its life.

00:03:54.607 --> 00:03:57.228
We call this early period inflation,

00:03:57.228 --> 00:03:58.894
where, shortly after the Big Bang,

00:03:58.894 --> 00:04:01.219
the universe expanded extremely fast

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:02.860
for a brief period.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.391
So, the universe will end

00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:06.858
in much the same state as it began,

00:04:06.858 --> 00:04:08.768
accelerating.

00:04:08.768 --> 00:04:10.778
We live at an extraordinary time

00:04:10.778 --> 00:04:12.350
in the life of the universe

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.861
where we can start to understand

00:04:13.861 --> 00:04:15.153
the universe's journey

00:04:15.153 --> 00:04:16.437
and view a history

00:04:16.437 --> 00:04:18.520
that plays itself out on the sky

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.622
for all of us to see.
