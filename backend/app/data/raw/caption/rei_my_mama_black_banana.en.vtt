00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:14.362
(Guitar music starts)

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:33.689
I've been looking

00:01:33.713 --> 00:01:35.572
Several days now

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:37.356
Where did they go?

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.331
Where did they go?

00:01:40.802 --> 00:01:42.862
My mama told me long ago

00:01:46.053 --> 00:01:49.609
I've lost so many precious things, I know

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:51.341
They won't be back

00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:54.386
Where did they go?

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:57.157
My mama told me long ago

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.863
Ain't nobody's ever gonna tell me
to abandon my old friend

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.188
Happy days, walking on the shore

00:02:07.212 --> 00:02:10.728
Happy days, walking on the shore

00:02:10.752 --> 00:02:14.954
Happy days, walking on the shore

00:02:15.806 --> 00:02:22.717
Ain't nobody's ever gonna tell me
to abandon my good memories at all

00:02:26.362 --> 00:02:29.165
I've seen so many pretty things

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.776
They don't mean a thing now

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.490
Listen to the song

00:02:35.514 --> 00:02:37.901
My mama told me long ago

00:03:00.933 --> 00:03:04.088
Ain't nobody's ever gonna tell me
to doubt my good old days

00:03:04.715 --> 00:03:07.652
Happy days, walking on the shore

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:11.865
Happy days, walking on the shore

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:16.399
Happy days, walking on the shore

00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:21.691
Ain't nobody's ever gonna tell me
to abandon my good memories at all

00:03:22.347 --> 00:03:24.861
Abandon my good memories at all

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:30.280
Abandon my good memories at all

00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:49.341
(Music ends)

00:03:49.663 --> 00:03:51.680
(Applause)

00:03:51.704 --> 00:03:52.855
Thank you.

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:58.503
(Applause)

00:03:58.527 --> 00:04:03.561
Thank you for giving me the opportunity
to perform tonight at TED New York.

00:04:04.442 --> 00:04:07.910
I've been a dedicated TED fan and viewer,

00:04:07.934 --> 00:04:12.649
and also, I actually used to live
in Manhattan when I was younger,

00:04:12.673 --> 00:04:17.230
so New York is like a second home to me,
and it's great to be back.

00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:21.022
The song I just performed
was called "my mama,"

00:04:21.046 --> 00:04:23.227
and the next song I'm going to perform

00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:26.908
is another original song of mine
called "BLACK BANANA."

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:34.544
This song I wrote about the importance
of being patient with your dreams.

00:04:34.568 --> 00:04:39.189
Because I think commitment
will always be rewarded.

00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:42.535
Just like fruit ripens
when the time is right.

00:04:42.988 --> 00:04:46.083
So it's my interpretation
of building the future.

00:04:49.852 --> 00:04:51.002
(Guitar music starts)

00:05:07.972 --> 00:05:09.122
Clap your hands.

00:05:37.032 --> 00:05:38.182
One!

00:05:38.827 --> 00:05:39.977
Two!

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:44.179
One, two, one, two, three, four.

00:05:57.941 --> 00:06:01.294
Sitting here, killing time,
I've been doing it all day

00:06:01.318 --> 00:06:04.807
I've been always smart
when it comes to gettin' away

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:08.355
Got a soda pop fizzin' hard
in my empty brain

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:11.961
When the time is right I'll move
alright so don't get too uptight

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:15.548
Silly girls in bathing suits
cleaning cars on Sundays

00:06:15.572 --> 00:06:19.543
They're living a lie
don't make as fool of yourself too soon

00:06:19.567 --> 00:06:22.690
Lining my bananas
on the window sill to ripen

00:06:22.714 --> 00:06:26.280
When the time is right I'll move
alright so don't get too uptight

00:06:27.222 --> 00:06:30.184

00:06:48.384 --> 00:06:52.130
Remember last December
when we went to get some pizza

00:06:52.154 --> 00:06:55.560
Was a brat, was running fast
to get home by my curfew

00:06:55.584 --> 00:06:58.758
Silly me, tripping quick,
I was almost killed by a honker

00:06:58.782 --> 00:07:02.521
When the time is right I'll move
alright so don't get too uptight

00:07:03.195 --> 00:07:05.904

00:07:38.438 --> 00:07:41.236
Bananananana Don't push me baby

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.945
Bananananana All I want is leeway

00:07:45.667 --> 00:07:49.249
Bananananana You gotta be patient
for the fruit to ripen

00:07:49.273 --> 00:07:51.059
