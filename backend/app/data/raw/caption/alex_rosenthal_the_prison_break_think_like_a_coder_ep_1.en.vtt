00:00:29.937 --> 00:00:37.377
Upon emerging from stasis, Ethic is the 
unfortunate recipient of three surprises.

00:00:37.377 --> 00:00:40.339
The first: a prison cell.

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:43.504
The second: complete amnesia.

00:00:43.504 --> 00:00:47.212
And the third: a mysterious stranger 
has gotten stuck

00:00:47.212 --> 00:00:50.867
squeezing through the bars on her window.

00:00:50.867 --> 00:00:56.425
His name is Hedge, and he has come 
to help Ethic save the world.

00:00:56.425 --> 00:00:59.956
But first they have to break out of jail.

00:00:59.956 --> 00:01:05.973
Hedge turns his hand into a lockpick and 
outlines the challenge ahead.

00:01:05.973 --> 00:01:10.623
Each lock in the prison works 
in the same unusual way.

00:01:10.623 --> 00:01:17.251
Inside the keyhole is a red dial that can 
be rotated to one of 100 positions

00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:19.699
numbered 1 through 100.

00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:24.043
The key for a given cell spins the dial 
to the right position,

00:01:24.043 --> 00:01:28.913
which, when stopped there, makes it turn 
green and unlocks the door.

00:01:28.913 --> 00:01:33.628
It would be out of the question to steal 
keys from a guard,

00:01:33.628 --> 00:01:36.765
but Hedge has a better idea.

00:01:36.765 --> 00:01:39.496
Hedge can carry out Ethic‘s commands.

00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:42.696
If Ethic tells him to walk 
5 steps forward,

00:01:42.696 --> 00:01:46.171
turn right, then walk another 5 steps,

00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:49.723
that’s exactly what he’ll do.

00:01:49.723 --> 00:01:52.844
Hedge needs specific instructions though.

00:01:52.844 --> 00:01:57.000
If Ethic says “pick the lock” or 
“try every combination”

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.685
that would be too vague, but “spin the 
dial 5 positions forward” would work.

00:02:03.685 --> 00:02:07.707
Once out of the cell, they will only have 
a few moments to crack the lock

00:02:07.707 --> 00:02:12.225
for the outer prison door too before 
the guards catch them.

00:02:12.225 --> 00:02:17.705
So what instructions will allow Hedge 
to efficiently open any door?

00:02:20.325 --> 00:02:24.395
Pause now to figure it out for yourself.

00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:30.752
Before we explain the solution, 
here’s a hint.

00:02:30.752 --> 00:02:37.180
A key programming concept that can help 
unlock the door is called a loop.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.510
This can be one or more instructions 
that Hedge will iterate— or repeat—

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.654
a specified number of times,

00:02:46.654 --> 00:02:50.065
like “jump up and down 100 times.”

00:02:50.065 --> 00:02:55.245
Or an instruction that Hedge will 
repeat until a condition is met,

00:02:55.245 --> 00:03:00.231
such as “keep jumping up and 
down until it’s 7 o’clock.”

00:03:00.231 --> 00:03:06.248
Pause now to figure it out for yourself.

00:03:06.248 --> 00:03:10.136
The first thing that’s clear is that you 
need to find a way for Hedge

00:03:10.136 --> 00:03:14.230
to try every combination until one works.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.520
What takes a little more effort is 
how exactly you do so.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.800
One solution would be to instruct Hedge 
to try every combination in succession.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.505
Try 1 and check the light.

00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:32.353
If it turns green, open the door, 
and if not, try 2.

00:03:32.353 --> 00:03:38.243
If that doesn’t work try 3. 
All the way up to 100.

00:03:38.243 --> 00:03:41.817
But it would be tedious to lay 
that out in its entirety.

00:03:41.817 --> 00:03:44.253
Why write more than 100 lines of code,

00:03:44.253 --> 00:03:48.388
when you can do the same thing 
with just 3?

00:03:48.388 --> 00:03:50.683
This is where a loop comes in.

00:03:50.683 --> 00:03:53.908
There are a few ways to go about this.

00:03:53.908 --> 00:03:56.263
The lock has 100 positions,

00:03:56.263 --> 00:04:02.314
so Ethic could say “Check the dial’s 
color, then spin the dial forward once,

00:04:02.314 --> 00:04:06.196
for 100 repetitions.

00:04:06.196 --> 00:04:13.012
Remember where the dial turns green, then 
have Hedge set it back to that number.”

00:04:13.012 --> 00:04:17.179
A loop like this, where you specify 
the number of times it repeats,

00:04:17.179 --> 00:04:20.165
is called a “for" loop.

00:04:20.165 --> 00:04:22.107
But an even more efficient loop

00:04:22.107 --> 00:04:27.357
would have Hedge spin the dial one 
position at a time until it turns green

00:04:27.357 --> 00:04:31.844
and as soon as that happens, have him 
stop and open the door.

00:04:31.844 --> 00:04:35.253
That way if the door unlocks on 1,

00:04:35.253 --> 00:04:39.248
he doesn’t need to cycle through 
all the rest of the numbers.

00:04:39.248 --> 00:04:42.662
This is an “until” loop,

00:04:42.662 --> 00:04:47.442
because it involves doing an 
action until a condition is met.

00:04:47.442 --> 00:04:52.211
A similar, alternate approach would be 
to turn the dial while it’s still red,

00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:54.310
then stop.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.042
That’s called a “while” loop.

00:04:58.042 --> 00:04:59.930
Back to the adventure.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:07.030
Hedge loops through the combinations, 
and the cell opens at 41.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.951
Ethic and Hedge wait until the 
perfect moment in the guards’ rotation

00:05:10.951 --> 00:05:14.480
and make a break for it.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.887
Soon, Ethic faces a choice: 
hide inside a mysterious crystal,

00:05:19.887 --> 00:05:23.851
or try to crack the outer door 
and make a run for it.

00:05:23.851 --> 00:05:26.117
Ethic chooses to run.

00:05:28.227 --> 00:05:34.643
The second door takes Hedge longer, 
requiring him to spin all the way to 93.

00:05:34.643 --> 00:05:37.193
But he gets it open

00:05:43.871 --> 00:05:48.741
and takes the opportunity 
to explain why he’s rescued Ethic.

00:05:48.741 --> 00:05:50.469
The world is in turmoil:

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:54.542
robots have taken over, 
and only Ethic can set things right.

00:05:54.542 --> 00:05:55.695
In order to do so,

00:05:55.695 --> 00:05:58.161
they’ll need to collect three 
powerful artifacts

00:05:58.161 --> 00:06:01.623
that are being used for nefarious 
purposes across the land.

00:06:01.623 --> 00:06:05.971
Only then can Ethic return to the 
world machine— that giant crystal—

00:06:05.971 --> 00:06:07.471
to set things right.

00:06:19.685 --> 00:06:22.525
Ethic may have escaped the prison…

00:06:22.525 --> 00:06:25.455
but what has she gotten herself into?
