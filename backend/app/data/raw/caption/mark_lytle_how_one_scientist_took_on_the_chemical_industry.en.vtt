00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:09.871
In 1958, Rachel Carson received a letter

00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:13.280
describing songbirds suddenly dropping 
from tree branches.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.920
The writer blamed their deaths 
on a pesticide called DDT

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.920
that exterminators had sprayed 
on a nearby marsh.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.660
The letter was the push 
Carson needed to investigate DDT.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.700
She had already heard from scientists 
and conservationists who were worried

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.232
that rampant use of the pesticide 
posed a threat to fish, birds,

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:33.862
and possibly humans.

00:00:33.862 --> 00:00:36.920
She began to make inquiries 
through government contacts

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.356
from her years working 
in the United States Bureau of Fisheries.

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:45.501
She asked: “what has already silenced 
the voices of spring?”

00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:50.784
In 1962, Carson published her findings 
in "Silent Spring."

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:53.514
Her book documented 
the misuse of chemicals

00:00:53.514 --> 00:00:56.374
and their toll on nature 
and human health.

00:00:56.374 --> 00:01:01.337
"Silent Spring" immediately drew both 
applause and impassioned dissent—

00:01:01.337 --> 00:01:04.247
along with vicious personal attacks 
on the author.

00:01:04.247 --> 00:01:10.123
How did this mild-mannered biologist 
and writer ignite such controversy?

00:01:10.123 --> 00:01:13.773
Carson began her career 
as a hardworking graduate student,

00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:17.584
balancing her studies in biology 
at John Hopkins University

00:01:17.584 --> 00:01:18.934
with part time jobs.

00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:22.204
Still, she had to leave school 
before completing her doctorate

00:01:22.204 --> 00:01:25.274
to provide for her ailing father 
and sister.

00:01:25.274 --> 00:01:28.314
Carson found part time work 
with the Bureau of Fisheries

00:01:28.314 --> 00:01:31.964
writing for a radio program 
on marine biology.

00:01:31.964 --> 00:01:36.054
Her ability to write materials that could 
hold the general public’s attention

00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:39.314
impressed her superiors, 
and in 1936,

00:01:39.314 --> 00:01:43.354
she became the second woman 
to be hired at the Bureau full time.

00:01:43.354 --> 00:01:47.769
In 1941, she published 
the first of three books on the ocean,

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:52.165
combining science with lyrical meditations
on underwater worlds.

00:01:52.165 --> 00:01:56.514
These explorations resonated 
with a wide audience.

00:01:56.514 --> 00:01:59.482
In "Silent Spring," 
Carson turned her attention

00:01:59.482 --> 00:02:03.824
to the ways human actions 
threaten the balance of nature.

00:02:03.824 --> 00:02:08.980
DDT was originally used during 
World War II to shield crops from insects

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.490
and protect soldiers 
from insect-borne diseases.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.337
After the war, it was routinely sprayed 
in wide swaths to fight pests,

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:19.647
often with unforeseen results.

00:02:19.647 --> 00:02:22.886
One attempt to eradicate fire ants 
in the southern U.S.

00:02:22.886 --> 00:02:29.060
killed wildlife indiscriminately,
but did little to eliminate the ants.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.170
In spite of this and other mishaps, 
the US Department of Agriculture

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.096
and chemical companies 
extolled the benefits of DDT.

00:02:37.096 --> 00:02:41.170
There was little regulation or public 
awareness about its potential harm.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.394
But Carson showed how 
the overuse of chemicals

00:02:44.394 --> 00:02:47.416
led to the evolution 
of resistant species—

00:02:47.416 --> 00:02:51.746
which, in turn, encouraged the development
of deadlier chemicals.

00:02:51.746 --> 00:02:54.330
Since DDT does not dissolve in water,

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.802
she asserted that over time 
it would accumulate in the environment,

00:02:58.802 --> 00:03:03.101
the bodies of insects, the tissues 
of animals who consume those insects,

00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:04.841
and eventually humans.

00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:09.907
She suggested that exposure to DDT 
might alter the structure of genes,

00:03:09.907 --> 00:03:13.727
with unknown consequences 
for future generations.

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:17.172
The response to "Silent Spring" 
was explosive.

00:03:17.172 --> 00:03:20.542
For many people the book 
was a call to regulate substances

00:03:20.542 --> 00:03:22.942
capable of catastrophic harm.

00:03:22.942 --> 00:03:26.802
Others objected that Carson 
hadn’t mentioned DDT’s role

00:03:26.802 --> 00:03:30.432
controlling the threat insects 
posed to human health.

00:03:30.432 --> 00:03:35.285
Former Secretary of Agriculture 
Ezra Taft Benson demanded to know

00:03:35.285 --> 00:03:40.497
“why a spinster with no children 
was so concerned about genetics?”

00:03:40.497 --> 00:03:44.767
and dismissed Carson 
as “probably a Communist.”

00:03:44.767 --> 00:03:49.796
A lawyer for a pesticide manufacturer 
alluded to Carson and her supporters

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:55.579
as “sinister influences” 
aiming to paint businesses as “immoral.”

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.099
In reality, Carson had focused 
on the dangers of chemicals

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.602
because they weren’t widely understood, 
while the merits were well publicized.

00:04:03.602 --> 00:04:06.008
She rejected the prevailing belief 
that humans

00:04:06.008 --> 00:04:08.736
should and could control nature.

00:04:08.736 --> 00:04:11.536
Instead, she challenged people 
to cultivate

00:04:11.536 --> 00:04:16.686
“maturity and mastery, not of nature, 
but of ourselves.”

00:04:16.686 --> 00:04:20.216
Carson died of cancer in 1964,

00:04:20.216 --> 00:04:23.906
only two years after 
the publication of "Silent Spring."

00:04:23.906 --> 00:04:28.584
Her work galvanized a generation 
of environmental activists.

00:04:28.584 --> 00:04:32.324
In 1969, under pressure 
from environmentalists,

00:04:32.324 --> 00:04:36.046
Congress passed 
the National Environmental Policy Act

00:04:36.046 --> 00:04:41.559
that required federal agencies to evaluate
environmental impacts of their actions.

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:42.989
To enforce the act,

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:47.216
President Richard Nixon created 
the Environmental Protection Agency.

00:04:47.216 --> 00:04:53.566
And in 1972, the EPA issued 
a partial ban on the use of DDT.

00:04:53.566 --> 00:04:58.254
Long after her death, Rachel Carson 
continued to advocate for nature

00:04:58.254 --> 00:05:00.934
through the lingering impact 
of her writing.
