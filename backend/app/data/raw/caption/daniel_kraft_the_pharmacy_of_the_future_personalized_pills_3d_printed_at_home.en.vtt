00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.416
We live in a medication nation.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.496
4.5 billion drug prescriptions
will be prescribed by doctors like me

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.336
this year, in the United States alone.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.776
That's 15 for every man, woman and child.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.016
And for most of us,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.576
our experience with this medication
is often a confusing number of pills,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.216
instructions, side effects,
one-size-fits-all dosing,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.696
which all too often
we aren't taking as prescribed.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.736
And this comes at tremendous expense,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.656
costing us our time,
our money and our health.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.576
And in our now exponential,
connected, data-driven age,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.080
I think we can and we must do better.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.016
So let's take a dive
at some of the challenges we have

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.096
and some potential solutions.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.376
Let's start with the fact

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.656
that many drugs don't work
for those who are prescribed them.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.296
The top 10 grossing drugs
in the United States this year,

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.936
they only benefit one in four
to one in 23 of who take them.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.976
That's great if you're number one,
but what about everybody else?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.056
And what's worse, drugs,
when they sometimes don't work,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.496
can still cause side effects.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.416
Take aspirin -- about one in four of us

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.376
who take aspirin to reduce
our risk of cardiovascular disease

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.376
are unknowingly aspirin-resistant

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.376
and still have the same risks
of gastrointestinal bleeds

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.160
that kill thousands every year.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.016
It's adverse drug reactions like these

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.216
that are, by some estimates,
the number four leading cause of death

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.456
in the United States.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.936
My own grandfather passed away

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.976
after a single dose of antibiotic
caused his kidneys to fail.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.976
Now, adverse drug reactions
and side effects

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.016
are often tied to challenges in dosing.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.776
I trained in pediatrics (little people)
and internal medicine (big people).

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.216
So one night I might have been
on call in the NICU,

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.496
carefully dosing
to the fraction of a milligram

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.936
a medication for a NICU baby.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.216
The next night --
on call in the emergency room,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.776
treating a 400-pound lineman
or a frail nursing-home patient

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.696
who, by most accounts, usually
would get the same dose of medications

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.016
from the formulary.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.376
Which would mean, most of the time
I would be underdosing the lineman

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.416
and overdosing the nursing-home patient.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.816
And beyond age and weight,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.800
we tend to ignore differences
in sex and race in dosing.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.856
Now, beyond this, we know
we have a massive challenge

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.096
with noncompliance or low adherence.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.216
Many of us who need
to take our medications

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.056
aren't taking them
or are taking them incorrectly.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.776
You know, 40 percent
of adults in the US over 65

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.256
are on five or more
prescription medications.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.616
Sometimes 15 or more.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.120
And even small improvements in adherence
can dramatically save dollars and lives.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.496
So, as we think into the future,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.296
you think that where we are today,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.296
as we often hear about smart,
personalized, targeted drugs,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.216
Internet of Things, gene therapy, AI,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.056
that we'd already arrived
in this era of precision medicine.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.776
In reality, we still live in an age

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.776
of empiric, trial-and-error,
imprecision medicine.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.096
I think we can do better.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.496
What if we could reimagine ways
to help make your medicine-taking easier?

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.136
To get the right doses
and combinations to match you?

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.856
What if we could move beyond
today's literal cutting edge

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.656
of pill cutters and fax machines,

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.496
to an era where we could have
better outcomes, lower costs,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.520
saving lives and space
in your medicine cabinet?

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.256
Well, I think part of the solution
is all the emerging ways

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.776
that we can measure and connect
our health care information.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.856
Today, we pretty much live
in a reactive, sick-care world,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.136
siloed information that doesn't flow.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.136
We have the potential to move
into a more continuous, real-time

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.416
proactive world of true health care.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.616
And part of that starts with
the emerging world of quantified self.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.896
We can measure so much
of our physiology and behaviors today,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.136
and often it's siloed
on our phones and scales,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.136
but it's starting to connect
to our clinicians, our caregivers,

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.360
so they can better optimize prevention,
diagnostics and therapy.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.736
And when we can do that,
we can do some interesting things.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.816
Take, for example, hypertension.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.656
It's the number one risk factor
for early death and morbidity worldwide.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.976
Half of adult Americans,
on approximation, have hypertension.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.016
Less than half have it well-controlled.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.517
It's often because it takes two
or three different classes of medications.

00:04:14.541 --> 00:04:17.856
It's tough to do adherence and adjust
your blood pressure medications.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.856
We have 500 preventable deaths
from noncontrolled hypertension

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.896
in the US every day.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.778
But now we're in the era
of connected blood pressure cuffs --

00:04:25.802 --> 00:04:27.856
the FDA just approved
a blood pressure cuff

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.536
that can go into your watch.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.055
There are now prototypes of cuffless
radar-based blood pressure devices

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:35.736
that can continuously stream
your blood pressure.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.216
So, in the future, I could --

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.907
instead of spot-checking
my blood pressure in the clinic,

00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:42.507
my doctor could see
my real-time numbers and my trends,

00:04:42.531 --> 00:04:44.696
and adjust them as necessary,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.136
with the help of a blood pressure
dosing algorithm

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.496
or using the Internet of Things.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.896
Now, technology today can do even more.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.296
My smartwatch, already today,
has an EKG built in

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.656
that can be read
by artificial intelligence.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.616
I'm wearing a small, Band-Aid-sized patch,

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.896
that is live-streaming
my vital signs right now.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.136
Let's take a look.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.576
They're actually a little
concerning at the moment.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.896
(Laughter)

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.336
Now, it's not just my real-time vitals

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.536
that can be seen
by my medical team or myself,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.256
it could be my retrospective data,

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.256
and again, that'd be used to modify
dosing and medication going forward.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.696
Even my weight can be super-quantified;

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.616
my weight, now my shape,
how much body mass, fat,

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.896
muscle mass I might have,

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.880
and use that to optimize
my prevention or therapy.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.616
And it's not just for the tech-savvy.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.776
Now, MIT engineers have modified wifi

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.256
so we can seamlessly
connect and collect our vital signs

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.536
from our connected rings
and smart mattresses.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.256
We can start to share
this digital exhaust, our digitome,

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.496
and even potentially crowdsource it,
sharing our health information

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.976
just like we share
with our Google Maps and driving,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.720
to improve our -- not our driving,
but our health experience globally.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.296
So, that's great.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.616
We can potentially now
collect this information.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.416
What if your labs
can go from the central lab

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.976
to your home, to your phone,
to even inside our bodies

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.016
to measure drug levels or other varieties?

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.136
And of course,
we're in the age of genomics.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.056
I've been sequenced,
it's just less than $1,000 today.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.536
And I can start to understand
my pharmacogenomics --

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.176
how my genes impact
whether I need high dose, low dose,

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.256
or maybe a different
medication altogether.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.056
Let's imagine if your physician
or your pharmacist

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.736
had this information
integrated into their workflow,

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.616
augmented with artificial intelligence,
AI, or as I like to refer to it, IA --

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.216
intelligence augmentation,

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.656
to leverage that information;

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.256
to understand, of the 18,000
or more approved drugs,

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.616
which would be the right dose
and combination for you.

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.656
So great, now maybe we can
optimize your drugs and your doses,

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.823
but the problem today is,
we're still using this amazing technology

00:06:46.847 --> 00:06:48.736
to keep track of our drugs.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.336
And of course, these technologies evolve,

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.496
there's connected dispensers,
reminder apps,

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.536
smart pill bottle caps that can text
or tweet you or your mother

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.416
if you haven't taken your medications.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.256
PillPack was just acquired by Amazon,

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.776
so soon we may have same-day delivery
of our drugs, delivered by drone.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.976
So, all these things are possible today,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.896
but we're still taking multiple pills.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.416
What if we can make it simpler?

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.616
I think one of the solutions
is to make better use of the polypill.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.096
A polypill is the integration of multiple
medications into a single pill.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.616
And we have these today in common
over-the-counter cold and flu remedies.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.136
And there have been
prevention polypill studies done,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.816
giving combinations
of statins, blood pressure, aspirin,

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.896
which in randomized studies
have been shown

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.256
to dramatically reduce risk,
compared to placebo.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.216
But these polypills weren't personalized,
they weren't optimized to the individual.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.736
What if we could optimize
your personalized polypill?

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.096
So it would be built for you,
based on you, it could adapt to you,

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.896
even every single day.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.856
Well, we're now in the era of 3D printing.
You can print personalized braces,

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.496
hearing aids, orthopedic devices,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.976
even I've been scanned
and had my jeans tailored to fit to me.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.296
So this got me thinking,

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.816
what if we could 3D-print
your personalized polypill?

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.216
So instead of taking
six medications, for example,

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.936
I could integrate them into one.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.296
So it would be easier to take,
improve adherence

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.940
and potentially, it could even
integrate in supplements,

00:08:05.964 --> 00:08:09.136
like vitamin D or CoQ10.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.136
So with some help --
I call these "IntelliMeds" --

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.856
and with the help of my
IntelliMedicine engineering team,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.896
we built the first
IntelliMedicine prototype printer.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.136
And here's how it works:

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.536
instead of full tablets,
we have small micromeds,

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.016
one or two milligrams each,

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.056
which are sorted and selected
based on the dose and combination

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.696
needed for an individual.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.176
And of course, these would be
doses and combinations

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.656
you could already take together,
FDA-approved drugs.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.496
We could change the pharmacokinetics

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.480
by professionally layering on different
elements to the individual micromeds.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.216
And when we hit print,

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.496
you print your combination of medications
that might be needed by you

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.256
on any individual day.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.176
And we'd start with, again, generic drugs
for the most common problems.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.856
About 90 percent of prescribed drugs today
are low-cost generics.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.216
And once we've printed the pill,
we can do some fun bells and whistles.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.496
We could print the name of the patient,

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.056
the date, the day of the week, a QR code.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.096
We could print different meds for tapering
for a patient on a steroid taper,

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.936
or tapering from pain medications.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.936
So, this is actually a look at our
prototype IntelliMedicine printer.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.936
See, I'll unveil it here.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.896
It has about 16 different silos,

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.520
each containing individual micromeds.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.896
And I can now adjust on the software
individual dosings.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.376
And when I do that,
the robotic arm will adjust

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.496
the height of these spansules
and the micromeds will release.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.056
I can now --

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.576
The automated process
would rotate and cycle through,

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.456
to make sure the micromeds are loaded.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.256
And when I hit print,

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.696
these will all fall through the device,

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.336
I now pull out my
personalized printed polypill

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.336
with the doses
and medications meant for me.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.976
And we can take a look,
if you look back to the slides,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.976
you can see the whole process,
we can see the drug silos being selected,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.976
the pills doing down the different silos,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.816
and being collected
in the individual capsule.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.536
Now, this is great,

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.616
I can potentially
print my meds based on me,

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.016
instead of taking six pills.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.176
I can now be looking
at my individual dosing.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.376
My smartwatch is looking
at my blood pressure:

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.976
I needed an adjustment
in my blood pressure medicines,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.696
my coumadin level.
My blood is too thin,

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.296
so I lower my micromed
dose of coumadin, a blood thinner.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.496
So, this could be
smartly adapted, day to day,

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.176
programmed by my physician
or cardiologist.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.776
And you can imagine that larger printers,
fast printers like this,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.536
could be in your corner pharmacy,

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.776
in your doctor's office,
in a rural clinic.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.736
But it could eventually merge and shrink
to small ones that could be in your home

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.136
with integrated cartridges like this
that are delivered by drone.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.216
Could print your personalized polypill,

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.536
each morning on your kitchen
or your bathroom cabinet.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.376
And this could evolve, I think,

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.216
into an incredible way to improve
adherence in medications across the globe.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.256
So, I hope we can reimagine
the future of medicine in new ways,

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.816
moving from polypharmacy,

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.296
one-size-fits-all,
low adherence, complications

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.376
to an era of personalized,
precise, on-demand medications

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.776
that can take us
and individualize our own health

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.496
and health and medicine around the planet.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.776
Thank you very much.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:20.320
(Applause)

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.936
Host: Daniel, that's kind of awesome.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.176
Really cool.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.576
Question for you, though.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.136
How long is it until, say, that
nursing-home patient that you mentioned

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.736
is able to print
their pills in their home?

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.536
Daniel Kraft: Well, again,
this is just a prototype.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.696
We think that the regulatory route
[may] be automated compounding,

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.990
and especially in nursing homes,
folks are taking multiple medications,

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.370
and they're often mixed up,

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.370
so it would be a perfect place
to start with these technologies.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:50.030
These aren't going to evolve and start
with printers on your bathroom counter.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:53.380
We need to be intelligent and smart
about how we roll these things out,

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:57.040
but realizing there's so many challenges
with dosing, adherence and precision,

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.610
and now that we have
all these amazing new technologies

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:01.700
that can integrate and be leveraged,
I think we need approaches like this

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.180
to really catalyze and foster

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.020
a true future of health and medicine.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.336
Host: Great, thank you.
DK: Thanks.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.840
(Applause)
