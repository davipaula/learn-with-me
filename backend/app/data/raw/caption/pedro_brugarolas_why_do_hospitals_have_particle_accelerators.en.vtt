00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:13.989
This syringe contains a radioactive form 
of glucose known as FDG.

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:18.025
The doctor will soon inject its contents 
into her patient’s arm,

00:00:18.025 --> 00:00:21.158
whom she’s testing for cancer 
using a PET scanner.

00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:24.598
The FDG will quickly circulate 
through his body.

00:00:24.598 --> 00:00:25.888
If he has a tumor,

00:00:25.888 --> 00:00:30.538
cancer cells within it will take up a 
significant portion of the FDG,

00:00:30.538 --> 00:00:33.538
which will act as a beacon 
for the scanner.

00:00:33.548 --> 00:00:35.939
PET tracers such as FDG

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:39.679
are among the most remarkable tools 
in medical diagnostics,

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:42.619
and their life begins in 
a particle accelerator,

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:44.939
just hours earlier.

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:48.539
The particle accelerator in question 
is called a cyclotron,

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.739
and it’s often housed in a bunker 
within hospitals.

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.879
It uses electromagnetic fields to propel 
charged particles

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.273
like protons faster and faster 
along a spiraling path.

00:01:00.273 --> 00:01:02.967
When the protons reach 
their maximum speed,

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:08.117
they shoot out onto a target that contains
a few milliliters of a type of water

00:01:08.117 --> 00:01:12.361
with a heavy form of oxygen 
called oxygen-18.

00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:16.200
When a proton slams into one of these 
heavier oxygen atoms,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.390
it kicks out another subatomic particle 
called a neutron.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.985
This impact turns oxygen-18 
into fluorine-18,

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:29.225
a radioactive isotope that can be 
detected on a PET scan.

00:01:29.225 --> 00:01:30.844
In a little under two hours,

00:01:30.844 --> 00:01:34.554
about half the fluorine will be gone 
due to radioactive decay,

00:01:34.554 --> 00:01:38.264
so the clock is ticking 
to get the scan done.

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:42.034
So how can fluorine-18 be 
used to detect diseases?

00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:46.024
Radiochemists at the hospital can use 
a series of chemical reactions

00:01:46.024 --> 00:01:49.664
to attach the radioactive fluorine 
to different molecules,

00:01:49.664 --> 00:01:51.874
creating radiotracers.

00:01:51.874 --> 00:01:55.924
The identity of the tracer depends on what
doctors want to observe.

00:01:55.924 --> 00:02:00.415
FDG is a common one because the rate at 
which cells consume glucose

00:02:00.415 --> 00:02:02.391
can signal the presence of cancer;

00:02:02.391 --> 00:02:04.021
the location of an infection;

00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:07.721
or the slowing brain function of dementia.

00:02:07.721 --> 00:02:10.911
The FDG is now ready for 
the patient’s scan.

00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:13.861
When a radiolabeled tracer 
enters the body,

00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:18.351
it travels through the circulatory system 
and gets taken up by its target—

00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:22.641
whether that's a protein in the brain,
cancer cells, or otherwise.

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:23.996
Within a few minutes,

00:02:23.996 --> 00:02:27.996
a significant amount of the tracer has 
found its way to the target area

00:02:27.996 --> 00:02:30.866
and the rest has cleared from circulation.

00:02:30.866 --> 00:02:33.666
Now the doctors can see 
their target using a PET,

00:02:33.666 --> 00:02:37.786
or positron emission tomography, scanner.

00:02:37.786 --> 00:02:41.856
The radiation that the tracer emits 
is what makes this possible.

00:02:41.856 --> 00:02:46.066
The isotopes used in PET decay 
by positron emission.

00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:50.189
Positrons are essentially electrons 
with positive charge.

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:53.235
When emitted, a positron collides 
with an electron

00:02:53.235 --> 00:02:56.375
from another molecule in its surroundings.

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:59.165
This causes a tiny nuclear reaction

00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:04.645
in which the mass of the two particles is 
converted into two high-energy photons,

00:03:04.645 --> 00:03:06.146
similar to X-rays,

00:03:06.146 --> 00:03:08.736
that shoot out in opposite directions.

00:03:08.736 --> 00:03:10.976
These photons will then impact an array

00:03:10.976 --> 00:03:14.976
of paired radiation detectors 
in the scanner walls.

00:03:14.976 --> 00:03:18.006
The software in the scanner 
uses those detectors

00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:21.726
to estimate where inside the body 
the collision occurred

00:03:21.726 --> 00:03:25.476
and create a 3D map of the 
tracer’s distribution.

00:03:25.476 --> 00:03:27.936
PET scans can detect the spread of cancer

00:03:27.936 --> 00:03:31.056
before it can be spotted with 
other types of imaging.

00:03:31.056 --> 00:03:34.936
They’re also revolutionizing the diagnosis
of Alzheimer’s disease

00:03:34.936 --> 00:03:37.356
by allowing doctors to see amyloid,

00:03:37.356 --> 00:03:41.656
the telltale protein buildup that 
otherwise couldn’t be confirmed

00:03:41.656 --> 00:03:43.270
without an autopsy.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.475
Meanwhile, researchers are actively 
working to develop new tracers

00:03:47.475 --> 00:03:52.015
and expand the possibilities of what 
PET scans can be used for.

00:03:52.015 --> 00:03:56.262
But with all this talk of radiation and
nuclear reactions inside the body,

00:03:56.262 --> 00:03:57.806
are these scans safe?

00:03:57.806 --> 00:04:01.986
Even though no amount of ionizing 
radiation is completely safe,

00:04:01.986 --> 00:04:06.530
the amount of radiation the body receives
during a PET scan is actually quite low.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.641
One scan is comparable to what you’re 
exposed to over two or three years

00:04:10.641 --> 00:04:14.091
from natural radioactive sources, 
like radon gas;

00:04:14.091 --> 00:04:16.111
or the amount a pilot would rack up

00:04:16.111 --> 00:04:20.531
from cosmic radiation after 
20 to 30 transatlantic flights.

00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:23.143
Most patients feel that those risks 
are acceptable

00:04:23.143 --> 00:04:26.673
for the chance to diagnose 
and treat their illnesses.
