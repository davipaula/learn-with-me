00:00:10.727 --> 00:00:13.032
How does this music make you feel?

00:00:13.032 --> 00:00:14.701
Do you find it beautiful?

00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:16.337
Is it creative?

00:00:16.337 --> 00:00:18.042
Now, would you change your answers

00:00:18.042 --> 00:00:21.522
if you learned 
the composer was this robot?

00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:23.501
Believe it or not,

00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:26.818
people have been grappling with
the question of artificial creativity,

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:29.825
alongside the question 
of artifcial intelligence,

00:00:29.825 --> 00:00:32.832
for over 170 years.

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:35.840
In 1843, Lady Ada Lovelace,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.149
an English mathematician considered
the world's first computer programmer,

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.577
wrote that a machine could not have
human-like intelligence

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:49.007
as long as it only did what humans
intentionally programmed it to do.

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:50.709
According to Lovelace,

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:53.694
a machine must be able 
to create original ideas

00:00:53.694 --> 00:00:57.392
if it is to be considered intelligent.

00:00:57.392 --> 00:01:03.814
The Lovelace Test, formalized in 2001,
proposes a way of scrutinizing this idea.

00:01:03.814 --> 00:01:07.256
A machine can pass this test
if it can produce an outcome

00:01:07.256 --> 00:01:12.260
that its designers cannot explain 
based on their original code.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.609
The Lovelace Test is, by design,
more of a thought experiment

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:18.020
than an objective scientific test.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.039
But it's a place to start.

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:21.233
At first glance,

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:25.153
the idea of a machine creating 
high quality, original music in this way

00:01:25.153 --> 00:01:27.308
might seem impossible.

00:01:27.308 --> 00:01:30.202
We could come up with an extremely
complex algorithm

00:01:30.202 --> 00:01:34.343
using random number generators,
chaotic functions, and fuzzy logic

00:01:34.343 --> 00:01:36.802
to generate a sequence of musical notes

00:01:36.802 --> 00:01:39.476
in a way that would be 
impossible to track.

00:01:39.476 --> 00:01:43.271
But although this would yield countless
original melodies never heard before,

00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:47.214
only a tiny fraction of them
would be worth listening to.

00:01:47.214 --> 00:01:49.551
With the computer having no way
to distinguish

00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:51.974
between those which
we would consider beautiful

00:01:51.974 --> 00:01:54.611
and those which we won't.

00:01:54.611 --> 00:01:56.248
But what if we took a step back

00:01:56.248 --> 00:02:01.221
and tried to model a natural process
that allows creativity to form?

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:03.473
We happen to know of at least
one such process

00:02:03.473 --> 00:02:07.995
that has lead to original, valuable,
and even beautiful outcomes:

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:10.783
the process of evolution.

00:02:10.783 --> 00:02:12.981
And evolutionary algorithms,

00:02:12.981 --> 00:02:16.240
or genetic algorithms
that mimic biological evolution,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.543
are one promising approach

00:02:18.543 --> 00:02:24.563
to making machines generate original
and valuable artistic outcomes.

00:02:24.563 --> 00:02:27.554
So how can evolution make 
a machine musically creative?

00:02:27.554 --> 00:02:29.665
Well, instead of organisms,

00:02:29.665 --> 00:02:41.378
we can start with an initial
population of musical phrases,

00:02:41.378 --> 00:02:42.841
and a basic algorithm

00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:45.765
that mimics reproduction 
and random mutations

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.177
by switching some parts,

00:02:48.177 --> 00:02:49.939
combining others,

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.353
and replacing random notes.

00:02:52.353 --> 00:02:55.051
Now that we have 
a new generation of phrases,

00:02:55.051 --> 00:03:00.005
we can apply selection using 
an operation called a fitness function.

00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:04.307
Just as biological fitness is determined
by external environmental pressures,

00:03:04.307 --> 00:03:08.464
our fitness function can be determined
by an external melody

00:03:08.464 --> 00:03:11.310
chosen by human musicians, or music fans,

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:20.115
to represent the ultimate 
beautiful melody.

00:03:20.115 --> 00:03:23.301
The algorithm can then compare
between our musical phrases

00:03:23.301 --> 00:03:25.098
and that beautiful melody,

00:03:25.098 --> 00:03:28.951
and select only the phrases
that are most similar to it.

00:03:28.951 --> 00:03:31.969
Once the least similar sequences
are weeded out,

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:36.498
the algorithm can reapply mutation
and recombination to what's left,

00:03:36.498 --> 00:03:40.802
select the most similar, or fitted ones,
again from the new generation,

00:03:40.802 --> 00:03:48.412
and repeat for many generations.

00:03:48.412 --> 00:03:52.728
The process that got us there has so much
randomness and complexity built in

00:03:52.728 --> 00:03:56.298
that the result might 
pass the Lovelace Test.

00:03:56.298 --> 00:04:00.246
More importantly, thanks to the presence 
of human aesthetic in the process,

00:04:00.246 --> 00:04:09.327
we'll theoretically generate melodies
we would consider beautiful.

00:04:09.327 --> 00:04:13.567
But does this satisfy our intuition
for what is truly creative?

00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:16.111
Is it enough to make something
original and beautiful,

00:04:16.111 --> 00:04:22.397
or does creativity require intention
and awareness of what is being created?

00:04:22.397 --> 00:04:26.193
Perhaps the creativity in this case
is really coming from the programmers,

00:04:26.193 --> 00:04:29.018
even if they don't understand the process.

00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:31.204
What is human creativity, anyways?

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:34.039
Is it something more than a system
of interconnected neurons

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.182
developed by biological 
algorithmic processes

00:04:37.182 --> 00:04:40.615
and the random experiences 
that shape our lives?

00:04:40.615 --> 00:04:44.152
Order and chaos,
machine and human.

00:04:44.152 --> 00:04:48.268
These are the dynamos at the heart
of machine creativity initiatives

00:04:48.268 --> 00:04:54.270
that are currently making music, 
sculptures, paintings, poetry and more.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.747
The jury may still be out

00:04:55.747 --> 00:05:00.051
as to whether it's fair to call 
these acts of creation creative.

00:05:00.051 --> 00:05:02.432
But if a piece of art can make you weep,

00:05:02.432 --> 00:05:03.973
or blow your mind,

00:05:03.973 --> 00:05:06.134
or send shivers down your spine,

00:05:06.134 --> 00:05:09.586
does it really matter 
who or what created it?
