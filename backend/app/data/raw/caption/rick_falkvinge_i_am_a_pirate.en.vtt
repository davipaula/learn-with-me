00:00:09.077 --> 00:00:12.413
Hi! I'm Rick, and...

00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:18.855
Wow, this was more difficult
for me than I had expected.

00:00:19.595 --> 00:00:20.975
(Sigh)

00:00:20.975 --> 00:00:23.246
I'm just going to say it, aren't I?

00:00:23.996 --> 00:00:27.697
Hi, I'm Rick, I'm a politician.

00:00:27.697 --> 00:00:30.220
(Laughter)

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.444
(Applause)

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:38.994
I didn't expect my life
to lead down this path, you know.

00:00:38.994 --> 00:00:44.708
It started out with talking politics
in the pub on Friday and Saturday nights.

00:00:44.708 --> 00:00:46.197
Then things scaled up,

00:00:46.197 --> 00:00:50.997
and we talked a little bit of politics
over coffee at work,

00:00:51.397 --> 00:00:56.263
and before you know it you've put multiple
people in the European Parliament

00:00:56.263 --> 00:00:59.353
and founded a political movement
that spread to over 50 countries.

00:00:59.353 --> 00:01:01.513
(Laughter)

00:01:02.523 --> 00:01:04.726
It could happen to any of you, you know.

00:01:04.726 --> 00:01:06.700
(Laughter)

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.602
So, to introduce the Pirate Party,

00:01:16.422 --> 00:01:19.919
how many in here have heard of
the Swedish Pirate Party before?

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:21.610
Let's see a show of hands.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.207
Well that's about half to two-thirds,

00:01:25.207 --> 00:01:28.435
which is pretty much what we see
across the world, actually.

00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:30.468
So I put it in the presentation.

00:01:30.468 --> 00:01:31.698
(Laughter)

00:01:32.018 --> 00:01:32.872
Just for kicks,

00:01:32.872 --> 00:01:36.482
how many in here have heard
of any other Swedish political party?

00:01:36.482 --> 00:01:38.032
Let's see a show of hands.

00:01:38.032 --> 00:01:39.321
(Laughter)

00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:43.692
Yup, same thing as all over the world,
scattered hands here in the audience.

00:01:43.692 --> 00:01:44.973
Isn't that funny?

00:01:44.973 --> 00:01:46.813
(Laughter)

00:01:47.763 --> 00:01:51.292
For those of you who haven't heard
of the Swedish Pirate Party before,

00:01:51.292 --> 00:01:55.285
basically, we love the Net,
we love copying and sharing,

00:01:55.285 --> 00:01:57.215
and we love civil liberties.

00:01:57.215 --> 00:02:01.344
For that, some people call us "pirates."

00:02:02.244 --> 00:02:06.024
Rather than being ashamed by this
which I think was their intent,

00:02:06.024 --> 00:02:08.901
we decided to stand tall about it,
and as a result of that,

00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:11.191
we now have two seats
in the European Parliament,

00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:12.943
15 seats in the Berlin Parliament,

00:02:12.943 --> 00:02:17.205
we have almost 200 seats
in local councils across Europe,

00:02:17.205 --> 00:02:20.845
and we are present in 56 countries,

00:02:21.535 --> 00:02:26.690
starting on January 1st, 2006
in Sweden as "Piratpartiet."

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.360
So for the next 12 minutes, we're going
to spend four minutes each

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.361
on a little bit of: what is the message
of this new movement,

00:02:34.361 --> 00:02:39.643
my story on it, and ending
with what we all can learn from there.

00:02:41.573 --> 00:02:45.099
The title is "Politics of Protest",
and we hear that a lot.

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.281
Like, "You're just a protest
movement, come on!"

00:02:48.611 --> 00:02:51.613
Well, like "protest?"

00:02:52.023 --> 00:02:55.906
We're not talking about defiance
for defiance's sake here.

00:02:55.906 --> 00:02:57.654
(Laughter)

00:02:58.834 --> 00:03:03.591
But rather, if you're not in government

00:03:03.591 --> 00:03:05.751
and disagreeing with what
the government does,

00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:08.678
then, by definition, you're dissenting.

00:03:08.678 --> 00:03:12.197
If you want to change the status quo,
you're part of a protest.

00:03:12.197 --> 00:03:14.833
There have been many before us, you know.

00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:19.207
The "Greens" came 40 years ago,
they protested pollution.

00:03:19.207 --> 00:03:23.203
"Labour" came 80 years ago,
they protested exploitation of workers.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:25.598
And you had "Liberals"
who came 120 years ago,

00:03:25.598 --> 00:03:30.676
which protested overbearing power
from royalty and the church.

00:03:31.396 --> 00:03:35.890
They all became established
politics and policy making.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.513
All of these waves start out
as a protest against something,

00:03:41.793 --> 00:03:44.883
and then solidifying into an ideology.

00:03:47.013 --> 00:03:48.655
40 years ago,

00:03:49.305 --> 00:03:53.615
the rallying cry of the youth
were peace and love,

00:03:54.845 --> 00:04:00.481
usually coupled with smoking
one of the odd exotic plant,

00:04:00.481 --> 00:04:04.470
you know, for the correct tone of voice
in saying this on media.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.195
That was later solidified into
a political standpoint of sustainability,

00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:13.238
- which has many more syllables -

00:04:13.238 --> 00:04:19.265
and therefore can't be pronounced the same
way, but this has stood until now.

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:22.740
When you look at a value
survey of 17-year olds,

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.312
environment and sustainability
is no longer on the top of their agenda.

00:04:28.312 --> 00:04:32.341
Something else overtook it
just in recent years,

00:04:32.341 --> 00:04:35.692
and that is freedoms
of speech and openness.

00:04:37.972 --> 00:04:40.481
And here's where
the old guard gets confused.

00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:45.650
"Freedom of speech, we introduced that
120 years ago; we already have that!

00:04:45.928 --> 00:04:47.513
Why are these people rallying?"

00:04:47.773 --> 00:04:50.312
And, honestly, I don't think
they understand that.

00:04:52.012 --> 00:04:56.822
This, in its easiest translation,
is "Leave the net alone."

00:04:58.632 --> 00:05:01.903
Because when you look
at what the old guard is doing,

00:05:02.353 --> 00:05:06.551
they're introducing censorship,
they're introducing wiretapping,

00:05:06.551 --> 00:05:10.915
they're introducing an end to anonymity,

00:05:11.705 --> 00:05:15.527
and all of this amounts
to cracking down freedom of speech.

00:05:16.557 --> 00:05:21.798
If the old politicians understood
that the laws they are making

00:05:21.798 --> 00:05:27.161
are the equivalent of putting
microphones under every café table,

00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:30.334
I think they would be
absolutely horrified,

00:05:30.834 --> 00:05:35.032
but they don't live online,
so they don't understand that.

00:05:37.042 --> 00:05:42.080
There's a crackdown going on
of the net all over the world,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.274
only the excuses differ.

00:05:44.524 --> 00:05:49.240
If you look at ex-President Mubarak,
it was almost to the day, a year ago,

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.014
as he shut down the Internet
to prevent the uprising in Egypt.

00:05:54.014 --> 00:05:57.107
[Internet was acting weird
so I tried turning it off and on again]

00:05:57.107 --> 00:05:59.713
You can kind of question his sanity,

00:06:00.263 --> 00:06:05.085
if he wants people to stay at home indoors
and he's shutting off the Internet,

00:06:06.385 --> 00:06:11.293
if he wants people to stay indoors
he should crank it up, for heaven's sake!

00:06:11.293 --> 00:06:13.140
But, still.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.509
Only the excuses differ.

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:20.155
Here in the West it's terrorism,
it's battling organized crime,

00:06:20.155 --> 00:06:24.923
and it's sometimes battling
pornography in various forms.

00:06:25.553 --> 00:06:29.680
In Muslim countries, it's preserving
the sanctity of the prophet.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.812
In some other countries,
it's security of the nation.

00:06:33.992 --> 00:06:35.625
But it's always the same action:

00:06:35.625 --> 00:06:39.585
censorship, wiretapping,
identifying, and crackdown.

00:06:40.585 --> 00:06:46.127
What that tells me is that
if the politicians of today

00:06:46.447 --> 00:06:50.830
see the entire growing up
generation as a problem,

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.108
then maybe it's the politicians
who are the problem.

00:06:56.108 --> 00:06:57.998
(Applause)

00:07:00.018 --> 00:07:01.356
Thank you.

00:07:01.356 --> 00:07:03.689
What we are demanding
isn't really rocket science.

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:07.610
We're demanding the same rights
that our parents had 40 years ago.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.800
If you sent a letter in the mail,
you and you alone would determine

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.187
whether you identified yourself
on the outside of the envelope,

00:07:14.377 --> 00:07:19.004
on the inside, just
on the letter, or not at all.

00:07:19.124 --> 00:07:23.355
Nobody had the right to open this letter
in transit just to see what you sent.

00:07:24.765 --> 00:07:27.116
Translated to the growing up generation,

00:07:27.116 --> 00:07:31.207
that means that people are demanding
to send whatever they like on the Net

00:07:31.207 --> 00:07:35.027
without being tracked,
wiretapped, and identified.

00:07:35.257 --> 00:07:39.090
And I think it's absolutely reasonable

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.880
that our children have
the same rights and civil liberties

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.040
that our parents had in their environment.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.061
Now the copyright industry,
in particular, objects to this.

00:07:50.111 --> 00:07:52.625
As in, "But we can't make
money in that case."

00:07:53.335 --> 00:07:55.420
That does not matter.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:08:00.203
An entrepreneur is tasked
with making money

00:08:00.203 --> 00:08:03.703
given the constraints
of society and technology.

00:08:03.703 --> 00:08:06.595
They do not get
to dismantle civil liberties,

00:08:06.965 --> 00:08:12.165
even if, and perhaps especially if,
they can't make money otherwise.

00:08:13.765 --> 00:08:16.797
That's why you're seeing rallies
for freedom of speech

00:08:16.797 --> 00:08:18.727
across Europe and the world.

00:08:18.727 --> 00:08:23.447
Here's a map of the anti-ACTA rallies,
and I think it's quite impressive.

00:08:23.927 --> 00:08:26.068
So, what's my story?

00:08:26.068 --> 00:08:27.601
How do I do this?

00:08:29.681 --> 00:08:33.201
Going from an ugly web page
to actually having people in parliament?

00:08:33.481 --> 00:08:35.811
There are many people
working on this, obviously,

00:08:35.811 --> 00:08:39.418
and the Pirate Party is just one movement
out of many, but this is my story.

00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:43.449
In 2005, I found three
things objectionable.

00:08:43.449 --> 00:08:48.022
There was the software patent debate
in the European parliament

00:08:48.022 --> 00:08:49.916
which would criminalize knowledge.

00:08:49.916 --> 00:08:53.291
There was yet another copyright
monopoly harshening in Sweden,

00:08:53.581 --> 00:08:57.929
and finally, the Data Retention Directive
being voted in the European Parliament,

00:08:57.929 --> 00:09:02.054
which made all our mobile phones
into governmental tracking devices.

00:09:02.854 --> 00:09:06.658
I took exception to that,
but realized at the end of the day

00:09:06.658 --> 00:09:09.312
that people are people;
these politicians aren't evil,

00:09:09.316 --> 00:09:13.516
they're just trying their best
to make a better world.

00:09:14.296 --> 00:09:17.518
So instead, you've got to have
a bit of empathy with your adversary,

00:09:17.518 --> 00:09:19.848
and understand their position,

00:09:20.168 --> 00:09:23.560
and I found that the best way
to effectuate change here

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.080
was to threaten to fire them.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:30.341
So I posted a manifesto.

00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:33.837
Short version is that I wrote
two lines in a chat,

00:09:33.837 --> 00:09:37.386
and more or less overnight,
it just blew up in my face.

00:09:37.386 --> 00:09:41.171
300 activists on the first day,
and that became the original crew.

00:09:41.501 --> 00:09:44.599
I realized this was my chance
to change the world for the better.

00:09:45.169 --> 00:09:46.876
I had a choice here;

00:09:46.876 --> 00:09:49.563
I could either be overwhelmed
by the scale of it,

00:09:49.563 --> 00:09:51.753
and retreat back into the gray mass,

00:09:51.753 --> 00:09:56.274
or, like I did, I had
a high paying IT job,

00:09:56.654 --> 00:10:00.793
I could take a loan
to live off of, quit my job

00:10:00.793 --> 00:10:03.123
- in that order, very important -

00:10:03.123 --> 00:10:04.863
(Laughter)

00:10:04.863 --> 00:10:06.776
and build a Pirate Party.

00:10:06.776 --> 00:10:09.724
So I decided to try to change the world.

00:10:10.414 --> 00:10:14.580
Elections were coming up
eight months out; elections of 2006.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.686
That was eight months, right?

00:10:16.686 --> 00:10:18.652
It was plenty of time.

00:10:18.652 --> 00:10:22.198
An engineering project is just over
the weekend, so eight months, come on.

00:10:22.758 --> 00:10:26.449
Turns out we got 0.63%
in the first elections,

00:10:26.449 --> 00:10:28.978
but there was an important change there.

00:10:28.978 --> 00:10:32.728
We had been, "Here is this
year's joker party."

00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:34.935
Going from that to,

00:10:35.475 --> 00:10:39.135
"Sir, do you have time for an interview
sometime in the next two weeks?"

00:10:39.645 --> 00:10:41.755
It was quite a change.

00:10:41.755 --> 00:10:45.859
Anyway, my loan ran out, inevitably.

00:10:49.359 --> 00:10:51.080
I asked the activists for help.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.759
If you have spare money
and want me to do this full-term,

00:10:53.759 --> 00:10:56.669
please give me a little bit of change
at the end of the month.

00:10:56.669 --> 00:10:59.195
I lived off begging for 18 months,

00:10:59.195 --> 00:11:02.669
and tabloids scandalized me
for it, of course.

00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:06.347
But it worked.

00:11:06.927 --> 00:11:09.350
So the EU elections came.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.350
We won the world.

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:17.110
Three and a half years
after founding we got 7%, 7.13%,

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.080
and two seats in the European elections.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:24.847
That was the quickest way of getting
into parliament that I found anywhere,

00:11:24.847 --> 00:11:29.206
and we became the largest party for people
under 30, with 25% of those votes.

00:11:29.206 --> 00:11:33.362
That just sent shockwaves
through the establishment.

00:11:33.992 --> 00:11:37.376
And this was then followed by successes
pretty much all over Europe.

00:11:37.756 --> 00:11:40.184
We're called the fastest-growing
political movement,

00:11:40.184 --> 00:11:43.777
and today I'm instead employed
by the European Parliament;

00:11:43.777 --> 00:11:48.751
again scandal, trying to be scandalized
by tabloids over that instead of begging.

00:11:49.601 --> 00:11:51.977
So, what do we learn from this?

00:11:52.567 --> 00:11:54.411
What can we learn?

00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:58.405
There's a Futurama quote,

00:11:59.955 --> 00:12:02.335
I like Futurama; I'm a nerd.

00:12:03.605 --> 00:12:07.484
"When push comes to shove,
you gotta do what you love -

00:12:08.344 --> 00:12:10.298
even when it's not a good idea."

00:12:10.298 --> 00:12:11.720
(Laughter)

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.344
What kind of idiot thinks
they can change the world

00:12:14.344 --> 00:12:16.534
by founding a new political party, really?

00:12:18.784 --> 00:12:20.346
This kind of idiot.

00:12:20.676 --> 00:12:23.420
There's another good quote.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:27.210
"If it's stupid
but works, it ain't stupid."

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.135
So we learn here that people aren't evil.

00:12:32.375 --> 00:12:35.093
Your worst adversaries aren't evil,

00:12:35.093 --> 00:12:38.224
and trying to portray them as such
does not help your cause,

00:12:38.224 --> 00:12:40.740
but it does something else;

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.382
it defines you.

00:12:44.892 --> 00:12:48.329
And that's very important, no matter
what cause you're setting out on.

00:12:50.199 --> 00:12:55.772
So, whether you believe that you can
or cannot make a difference,

00:12:55.772 --> 00:12:57.434
it's a matter of attitude.

00:12:57.434 --> 00:13:00.768
And, in both cases, you're probably right.

00:13:06.337 --> 00:13:08.041
This is about leadership.

00:13:08.041 --> 00:13:12.009
This is about saying, "I'm going to change
the world, who's with me?"

00:13:13.029 --> 00:13:16.847
And choose a reasonable approach.

00:13:16.847 --> 00:13:20.077
Don't shoot for the moon,
that's just silly.

00:13:20.487 --> 00:13:22.469
That's been done already.

00:13:22.469 --> 00:13:24.172
Shoot for Mars.

00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:30.271
End illiteracy, help two billion
people learn to read.

00:13:31.161 --> 00:13:33.106
You can do this.

00:13:34.296 --> 00:13:39.946
Everyone in this room has some cause
they would love to make a difference in.

00:13:39.946 --> 00:13:41.430
You can do it.

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:45.222
Don't dare let anybody tell you otherwise.

00:13:47.552 --> 00:13:52.251
You've got to be credible, inclusive,
and tangible when communicating this.

00:13:52.251 --> 00:13:55.581
As long as you do that,
it's just a matter of telling people,

00:13:55.581 --> 00:13:58.978
"I believe; I know we can do this.

00:13:59.298 --> 00:14:03.649
We can write ourselves
into the history books by going to Mars."

00:14:05.639 --> 00:14:08.593
Going home, it's a matter of setting
a couple of bullet points:

00:14:08.593 --> 00:14:11.738
recruit one dozen
volunteer rocket scientists,

00:14:11.738 --> 00:14:14.898
two dozen mechanical engineers,

00:14:14.898 --> 00:14:17.875
and someone who's willing to mix
rocket fuel in their backyard.

00:14:18.825 --> 00:14:20.916
Some of you are laughing.

00:14:22.136 --> 00:14:24.066
This is how you do it.

00:14:27.516 --> 00:14:33.824
People will take your vision
and do whatever they can to further it,

00:14:34.524 --> 00:14:37.113
you just have to let them.

00:14:37.513 --> 00:14:41.296
So, as a final note:
change doesn't just happen,

00:14:42.566 --> 00:14:45.014
somebody makes it happen.

00:14:45.554 --> 00:14:50.767
And you, everyone in this room,
can be that person.

00:14:53.577 --> 00:14:55.148
And that's my presentation.

00:14:55.148 --> 00:14:59.213
Please tweet any feedback you have,
I love to see my name on Twitter.

00:14:59.213 --> 00:15:00.452
(Laughter)

00:15:00.452 --> 00:15:02.430
(Applause)
