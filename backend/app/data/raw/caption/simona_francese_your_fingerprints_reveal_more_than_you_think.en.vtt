00:00:12.972 --> 00:00:17.858
Do you ever stop and think,
during a romantic dinner,

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:20.774
"I've just left my fingerprints
all over my wine glass."

00:00:20.798 --> 00:00:21.799
(Laughter)

00:00:21.823 --> 00:00:24.668
Or do you ever worry,
when you visit a friend,

00:00:24.692 --> 00:00:29.170
about leaving a little piece of you behind
on every surface that you touch?

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.343
And even this evening,

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:35.223
have you paid any attention
to sit without touching anything?

00:00:36.148 --> 00:00:37.735
Well, you're not alone.

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:42.004
Thankfully, criminals underestimate
the power of fingerprints, too.

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:46.121
And I'm not just talking about
the twisted parting of lines

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:49.253
that make our fingerprint unique.

00:00:49.277 --> 00:00:53.572
I'm talking about
an entire world of information

00:00:53.596 --> 00:00:57.260
hiding in a small, often invisible thing.

00:00:57.718 --> 00:01:00.404
In fact, fingerprints
are made up of molecules

00:01:00.428 --> 00:01:02.171
that belong to three classes:

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:06.997
sweat molecules that we all produce
in very different amounts ...

00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:11.452
molecules that we introduce into our body
and then we sweat out

00:01:11.476 --> 00:01:15.040
and molecules that we may contaminate
our fingertips with

00:01:15.064 --> 00:01:18.755
when we come across substances
like blood, paint, grease,

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:20.736
but also invisible substances.

00:01:21.326 --> 00:01:26.239
And molecules are
the storytellers of who we are

00:01:26.263 --> 00:01:27.893
and what we've been up to.

00:01:28.492 --> 00:01:33.510
We just need to have
the right technology to make them talk.

00:01:34.006 --> 00:01:39.171
So let me take you on a journey
of unthinkable capabilities.

00:01:42.528 --> 00:01:44.607
Katie has been raped

00:01:45.762 --> 00:01:50.338
and her lifeless body has been found
in the woods three days later,

00:01:50.362 --> 00:01:51.862
after her disappearance.

00:01:52.577 --> 00:01:55.087
The police is targeting three suspects,

00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:59.014
having narrowed down
the search from over 20 men

00:01:59.038 --> 00:02:01.695
who had been seen
in that area on the same day.

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:04.721
The only piece of evidence

00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:09.375
is two very faint,
overlapping fingerprints

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.017
on the tape that was found
wrapped around Katie's neck.

00:02:13.912 --> 00:02:18.548
Often, faint and overlapping fingerprints
cannot help the police

00:02:18.572 --> 00:02:20.515
to make an identification.

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:24.889
And until recently,
this might have been the end of the road,

00:02:25.886 --> 00:02:28.112
but this is where
we can make the difference.

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:31.864
The tape is sent to our labs,

00:02:31.888 --> 00:02:34.848
where we're asked to use
our cutting-edge technology

00:02:34.872 --> 00:02:36.732
to help with the investigation.

00:02:38.032 --> 00:02:40.619
And here, we use an existing form

00:02:40.643 --> 00:02:45.303
of mass spectrometry imaging technology

00:02:45.327 --> 00:02:47.890
that we have further developed and adapted

00:02:47.914 --> 00:02:53.164
specifically for the molecular and imaging
analysis of fingerprints.

00:02:53.936 --> 00:02:57.921
In essence, we fire
a UV laser at the print,

00:02:57.945 --> 00:03:01.802
and we cause the desorption
of the molecules from the print,

00:03:01.826 --> 00:03:04.701
ready to be captured
by the mass spectrometer.

00:03:05.708 --> 00:03:09.009
Mass spectrometry measures
the weight of the molecules --

00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:11.327
or as we say, the mass --

00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:15.869
and those numbers that you see there,
they indicate that mass.

00:03:15.893 --> 00:03:17.531
But more crucially,

00:03:17.555 --> 00:03:22.010
they indicate who those molecules are --

00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:24.151
whether I'm seeing paracetamol

00:03:24.175 --> 00:03:27.800
or something more sinister,
forensically speaking.

00:03:28.734 --> 00:03:31.750
We applied this technology
to the evidence that we have

00:03:31.774 --> 00:03:35.602
and we found the presence
of condom lubricants.

00:03:36.337 --> 00:03:40.965
In fact, we've developed protocols
that enable us to even suggest

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.282
what brand of condom might have been used.

00:03:45.097 --> 00:03:47.184
So we pass this information to the police,

00:03:47.208 --> 00:03:50.614
who, meanwhile,
have obtained a search warrant

00:03:50.638 --> 00:03:56.590
and they found the same brand
of condom in Dalton's premises.

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:02.627
And with Dalton and Thomson
also having records for sexual assaults,

00:04:02.651 --> 00:04:07.349
then it is Chapman that may become
the less likely suspect.

00:04:08.028 --> 00:04:11.067
But is this information
enough to make an arrest?

00:04:11.533 --> 00:04:12.684
Of course not,

00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:15.438
and we are asked to delve deeper
with our investigation.

00:04:16.225 --> 00:04:20.960
So we found out, also, the presence
of other two very interesting molecules.

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.053
One is an antidepressant,

00:04:24.077 --> 00:04:26.099
and one is a very special molecule.

00:04:26.123 --> 00:04:28.248
It only forms in your body

00:04:28.272 --> 00:04:32.306
if you drink alcohol
and consume cocaine at the same time.

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:36.569
And alcohol is known to potentiate
the effects of cocaine,

00:04:36.593 --> 00:04:41.357
so here, we now have a hint
on the state of mind

00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:44.468
of the individual
whilst perpetrating the crime.

00:04:45.198 --> 00:04:48.176
We passed this information to the police,

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.484
and they found out that, actually,
Thomson is a drug addict,

00:04:52.508 --> 00:04:56.738
and he also has a medical record
for psychotic episodes,

00:04:56.762 --> 00:05:00.533
for which presumably
the antidepressant was prescribed.

00:05:01.016 --> 00:05:05.793
So now Thomson becomes
the more likely suspect.

00:05:07.463 --> 00:05:12.956
But the reality is that I still don't know
where these molecules are coming from,

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.726
from which fingerprint,

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.723
and who those two fingerprints belong to.

00:05:18.346 --> 00:05:19.617
Fear not.

00:05:19.641 --> 00:05:22.456
Mass spectrometry imaging
can help us further.

00:05:22.763 --> 00:05:26.008
In fact, the technology is so powerful

00:05:26.032 --> 00:05:31.079
that we can see where
these molecules are on a fingerprint.

00:05:31.821 --> 00:05:33.872
Like you see in this video,

00:05:33.896 --> 00:05:37.774
every single one of those peaks
corresponds to a mass,

00:05:37.798 --> 00:05:39.870
every mass to a molecule,

00:05:39.894 --> 00:05:44.835
and we can interrogate the software,
by selecting each of those molecules,

00:05:44.859 --> 00:05:48.509
as to where they are present
on a fingermark.

00:05:49.385 --> 00:05:52.458
And some images are not very revealing,

00:05:52.482 --> 00:05:53.949
some are better,

00:05:53.973 --> 00:05:56.435
some are really good.

00:05:56.459 --> 00:06:01.451
And we can create multiple images
of the same mark --

00:06:01.475 --> 00:06:05.562
in theory, hundreds of images
of the same fingerprint --

00:06:05.586 --> 00:06:08.644
for as many of the molecules
that we have detected.

00:06:09.547 --> 00:06:11.119
So step one ...

00:06:12.262 --> 00:06:16.247
for overlapping fingerprints, chances are,

00:06:16.271 --> 00:06:18.792
especially if they come
from different individuals,

00:06:18.816 --> 00:06:22.235
that the molecular composition
is not identical,

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:27.342
so let's ask the software
to visualize those unique molecules

00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:31.240
just present in one fingermark
and not in the other one.

00:06:31.875 --> 00:06:33.560
By doing so,

00:06:33.584 --> 00:06:37.532
that's how we can separate
the two ridge patterns.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.465
And this is really important

00:06:40.489 --> 00:06:46.514
because the police now are able
to identify one of the two fingerprints,

00:06:46.538 --> 00:06:48.695
which actually corresponds to Katie.

00:06:49.368 --> 00:06:50.861
And they've been able to say so

00:06:50.885 --> 00:06:53.488
because they've compared
the two separate images

00:06:53.512 --> 00:06:56.193
with one taken posthumously from Katie.

00:06:56.902 --> 00:07:02.095
So now, we can concentrate
on one fingerprint only --

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:03.976
that of the killer's.

00:07:04.477 --> 00:07:06.468
So then, step two ...

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:09.736
where are these three
molecules that I've seen?

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.498
Well, let's interrogate the software --
show me where they are.

00:07:13.522 --> 00:07:15.182
And by doing this,

00:07:15.206 --> 00:07:21.487
only portions of the image
of the killer's fingerprint show up.

00:07:21.511 --> 00:07:22.915
In other words,

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:28.677
those substances are only present
in the killer's print.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.340
So now our molecular findings
start matching very nicely

00:07:34.364 --> 00:07:37.065
the police intelligence about Thomson,

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:39.578
should that fingerprint belong to him.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.297
But the reality is that that print
is still not good enough

00:07:44.321 --> 00:07:46.369
to make an identification.

00:07:46.393 --> 00:07:47.794
Step three:

00:07:47.818 --> 00:07:54.482
since we can generate hundreds of images
of the same fingerprint,

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:57.429
why don't we superimpose them,

00:07:57.453 --> 00:07:58.606
and by doing so,

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.043
try to improve the rich pattern
of continuity and clarity?

00:08:02.067 --> 00:08:03.567
That's the result.

00:08:04.303 --> 00:08:05.705
Striking.

00:08:05.729 --> 00:08:09.671
We now have a very clear image
of the fingerprint

00:08:09.695 --> 00:08:12.445
and the police can run it
through the database.

00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:14.829
The match comes out to Thomson.

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:17.340
Thomson is our killer.

00:08:17.364 --> 00:08:21.332
(Applause)

00:08:21.356 --> 00:08:28.103
Katie, the suspects and the circumstances
of the crime aren't real,

00:08:28.127 --> 00:08:31.676
but the story contains elements

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.047
of the real police casework
we've been confronted with,

00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:39.237
and is a composite of the intelligence
that we can provide --

00:08:39.261 --> 00:08:41.792
that we have been able
to provide the police.

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:47.727
And I'm really, really thrilled
that after nine years of intense research,

00:08:47.751 --> 00:08:49.712
as of 2017,

00:08:49.736 --> 00:08:52.842
we are able to contribute
to police investigations.

00:08:53.462 --> 00:08:56.086
Mine is no longer a dream;

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:57.610
it's a goal.

00:08:57.958 --> 00:09:00.782
We're going to do this wider and wider,

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:02.103
bigger and bigger,

00:09:02.127 --> 00:09:05.208
and we're going to know
more about the suspect,

00:09:05.232 --> 00:09:07.204
and we're going to build an identikit.

00:09:08.121 --> 00:09:12.860
I believe this is also a new era
for criminal profiling.

00:09:12.884 --> 00:09:14.274
The work of the criminologist

00:09:14.298 --> 00:09:18.383
draws on the expert recognition
of behavioral patterns

00:09:18.407 --> 00:09:22.032
that have been observed before
to belong to a certain type,

00:09:22.056 --> 00:09:23.556
to a certain profile.

00:09:23.869 --> 00:09:28.316
As opposed to this expert
but subjective evaluation,

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.671
we're trying to do the same thing,

00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:34.259
but from the molecular makeup
of the fingerprint,

00:09:34.283 --> 00:09:36.094
and the two can work together.

00:09:36.812 --> 00:09:39.678
I did say that molecules are storytellers,

00:09:39.702 --> 00:09:42.241
so information on your health,

00:09:42.265 --> 00:09:46.422
your actions, your lifestyle,
your routines,

00:09:46.446 --> 00:09:48.234
they're all there,

00:09:48.258 --> 00:09:50.694
accessible in a fingerprint.

00:09:51.403 --> 00:09:55.839
And molecules are
the storytellers of our secrets

00:09:56.813 --> 00:09:58.148
in just a touch.

00:09:58.706 --> 00:09:59.857
Thank you.

00:09:59.881 --> 00:10:01.039
(Audience) Wow.

00:10:01.063 --> 00:10:04.595
(Applause)
