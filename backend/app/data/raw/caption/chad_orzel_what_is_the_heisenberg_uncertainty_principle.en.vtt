00:00:07.255 --> 00:00:10.812
The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
is one of a handful of ideas

00:00:10.812 --> 00:00:14.686
from quantum physics to 
expand into general pop culture.

00:00:14.686 --> 00:00:18.112
It says that you can never simultaneously
know the exact position

00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:22.893
and the exact speed of an object
and shows up as a metaphor in everything

00:00:22.893 --> 00:00:26.409
from literary criticism
to sports commentary.

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:29.429
Uncertainty is often explained as a result
of measurement,

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.561
that the act of measuring an object's
position changes its speed, or vice versa.

00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:38.378
The real origin is much deeper
and more amazing.

00:00:38.378 --> 00:00:41.759
The Uncertainty Principle exists
because everything in the universe

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:46.318
behaves like both a particle and a wave
at the same time.

00:00:46.318 --> 00:00:50.458
In quantum mechanics, the exact position
and exact speed of an object

00:00:50.458 --> 00:00:51.896
have no meaning.

00:00:51.896 --> 00:00:53.147
To understand this,

00:00:53.147 --> 00:00:57.053
we need to think about what it means
to behave like a particle or a wave.

00:00:57.053 --> 00:01:01.857
Particles, by definition, exist in 
a single place at any instant in time.

00:01:01.857 --> 00:01:05.286
We can represent this by a graph
showing the probability of finding

00:01:05.286 --> 00:01:09.030
the object at a particular place,
which looks like a spike,

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.707
100% at one specific position,
and zero everywhere else.

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:17.621
Waves, on the other hand,
are disturbances spread out in space,

00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:20.338
like ripples covering 
the surface of a pond.

00:01:20.338 --> 00:01:23.767
We can clearly identify features
of the wave pattern as a whole,

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:25.933
most importantly, its wavelength,

00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:28.640
which is the distance between two 
neighboring peaks,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.459
or two neighboring valleys.

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:33.017
But we can't assign it a single position.

00:01:33.017 --> 00:01:36.282
It has a good probability of 
being in lots of different places.

00:01:36.282 --> 00:01:39.099
Wavelength is essential for
quantum physics

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:42.419
because an object's wavelength
is related to its momentum,

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:44.024
mass times velocity.

00:01:44.024 --> 00:01:46.909
A fast-moving object has lots of momentum,

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.019
which corresponds to 
a very short wavelength.

00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:54.559
A heavy object has lots of momentum
even if it's not moving very fast,

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:57.156
which again means a very short wavelength.

00:01:57.156 --> 00:02:00.927
This is why we don't notice
the wave nature of everyday objects.

00:02:00.927 --> 00:02:02.644
If you toss a baseball up in the air,

00:02:02.644 --> 00:02:07.029
its wavelength is a billionth of a 
trillionth of a trillionth of a meter,

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:09.364
far too tiny to ever detect.

00:02:09.364 --> 00:02:12.324
Small things, 
like atoms or electrons though,

00:02:12.324 --> 00:02:16.142
can have wavelengths big enough
to measure in physics experiments.

00:02:16.142 --> 00:02:19.475
So, if we have a pure wave, 
we can measure its wavelength,

00:02:19.475 --> 00:02:23.101
and thus its momentum,
but it has no position.

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:25.248
We can know a particles position
very well,

00:02:25.248 --> 00:02:28.489
but it doesn't have a wavelength,
so we don't know its momentum.

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.600
To get a particle with both position
and momentum,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.760
we need to mix the two pictures

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.163
to make a graph that has waves,
but only in a small area.

00:02:37.163 --> 00:02:38.800
How can we do this?

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.554
By combining waves 
with different wavelengths,

00:02:41.554 --> 00:02:46.528
which means giving our quantum object some
possibility of having different momenta.

00:02:46.528 --> 00:02:49.282
When we add two waves, 
we find that there are places

00:02:49.282 --> 00:02:52.055
where the peaks line up,
making a bigger wave,

00:02:52.055 --> 00:02:55.821
and other places where the peaks of one
fill in the valleys of the other.

00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:58.279
The result has regions where
we see waves

00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:01.106
separated by regions of nothing at all.

00:03:01.106 --> 00:03:02.590
If we add a third wave,

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.709
the regions where the waves cancel out
get bigger,

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.891
a fourth and they get bigger still,
with the wavier regions becoming narrower.

00:03:09.891 --> 00:03:13.089
If we keep adding waves,
we can make a wave packet

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:16.168
with a clear wavelength
in one small region.

00:03:16.168 --> 00:03:20.224
That's a quantum object with both
wave and particle nature,

00:03:20.224 --> 00:03:23.311
but to accomplish this,
we had to lose certainty

00:03:23.311 --> 00:03:25.805
about both position and momentum.

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:28.223
The positions isn't restricted 
to a single point.

00:03:28.223 --> 00:03:30.918
There's a good probability
of finding it within some range

00:03:30.918 --> 00:03:32.837
of the center of the wave packet,

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:35.586
and we made the wave packet
by adding lots of waves,

00:03:35.586 --> 00:03:38.012
which means there's 
some probability of finding it

00:03:38.012 --> 00:03:41.291
with the momentum corresponding
to any one of those.

00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:44.740
Both position and momentum
are now uncertain,

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.816
and the uncertainties are connected.

00:03:46.816 --> 00:03:49.209
If you want to reduce 
the position uncertainty

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.628
by making a smaller wave packet,
you need to add more waves,

00:03:52.628 --> 00:03:54.865
which means a bigger momentum uncertainty.

00:03:54.865 --> 00:03:58.047
If you want to know the momentum better,
you need a bigger wave packet,

00:03:58.047 --> 00:04:01.012
which means a bigger position uncertainty.

00:04:01.012 --> 00:04:03.221
That's the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle,

00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:08.207
first stated by German physicist
Werner Heisenberg back in 1927.

00:04:08.207 --> 00:04:12.589
This uncertainty isn't a matter
of measuring well or badly,

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:17.107
but an inevitable result
of combining particle and wave nature.

00:04:17.107 --> 00:04:20.663
The Uncertainty Principle isn't just 
a practical limit on measurment.

00:04:20.663 --> 00:04:23.733
It's a limit on what properties 
an object can have,

00:04:23.733 --> 00:04:28.157
built into the fundamental structure
of the universe itself.
