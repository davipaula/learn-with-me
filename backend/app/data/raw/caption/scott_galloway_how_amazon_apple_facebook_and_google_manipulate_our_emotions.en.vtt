00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.802
[This talk contains graphic language
Viewer discretion is advised]

00:00:16.972 --> 00:00:19.745
So, this is the first and the last slide

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.095
each of my 6,400 students
over the last 15 years has seen.

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.859
I do not believe you can build
a multibillion-dollar organization

00:00:27.883 --> 00:00:33.370
unless you are clear on which instinct
or organ you are targeting.

00:00:33.394 --> 00:00:36.483
Our species has a need for a superbeing.

00:00:36.507 --> 00:00:39.533
Our competitive advantage
as a species is our brain.

00:00:39.557 --> 00:00:42.700
Our brain is robust enough to ask
these really difficult questions,

00:00:42.724 --> 00:00:46.222
but, unfortunately, it doesn't have
the processing power to answer them,

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:48.544
which creates a need for a superbeing

00:00:48.568 --> 00:00:50.997
that we can pray to
and look to for answers.

00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:52.306
What is prayer?

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.608
Sending a query into the universe,

00:00:54.632 --> 00:00:57.404
and hopefully there's some sort
of divine intervention --

00:00:57.428 --> 00:00:59.760
we don't need to understand
what's going on --

00:00:59.784 --> 00:01:01.940
from an all-knowing, all-seeing superbeing

00:01:01.964 --> 00:01:05.772
that gives us authority
that this is the right answer.

00:01:05.796 --> 00:01:08.509
"Will my kid be all right?"

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.177
You have your planet of stuff,

00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:11.852
you have your planet of work,

00:01:11.876 --> 00:01:13.681
you have your planet of friends.

00:01:13.705 --> 00:01:15.199
If you have kids,

00:01:15.223 --> 00:01:18.318
you know that once something
comes off the rails with your kids,

00:01:18.342 --> 00:01:19.870
everything melts,

00:01:19.894 --> 00:01:22.531
in your universe
to the Sun that is your kids.

00:01:22.555 --> 00:01:25.439
"Will my kid be all right?"

00:01:25.463 --> 00:01:29.552
"Symptoms and treatment of croup"
in the Google query box.

00:01:29.576 --> 00:01:33.514
One in six queries presented to Google
have never been asked before

00:01:33.538 --> 00:01:34.862
in the history of mankind.

00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:40.294
What priest, teacher, rabbi, scholar,
mentor, boss has so much credibility

00:01:40.318 --> 00:01:42.864
that one in six questions
posed to that person

00:01:42.888 --> 00:01:44.639
have never been asked before?

00:01:44.663 --> 00:01:47.929
Google is our modern man's God.

00:01:47.953 --> 00:01:52.257
Imagine your face and your name
above everything you've put into that box,

00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:56.401
and you're going to realize
you trust Google more than any entity

00:01:56.425 --> 00:01:57.639
in your history.

00:01:57.663 --> 00:01:58.730
(Laughter)

00:01:58.754 --> 00:02:00.513
Let's move further down the torso.

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:02.536
(Laughter)

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.035
One of the other wonderful things
about our species

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:08.553
is we not only need to be loved,
but we need to love others.

00:02:08.577 --> 00:02:11.535
Children with poor nutrition
but a lot of affection

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:16.147
have better outcomes than children
with good nutrition and poor affection.

00:02:16.517 --> 00:02:19.945
However, the best signal
that you might make it

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:24.026
to be part of the number-one fastest
growing demographic in the world --

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.459
centenarians, people
who live to triple digits --

00:02:26.483 --> 00:02:27.659
there are three signals.

00:02:27.683 --> 00:02:31.619
In reverse order: your genetics --
not as important as you'd like to think,

00:02:31.643 --> 00:02:33.919
so you can continue to treat
your body like shit

00:02:33.943 --> 00:02:35.830
and think, "Oh, Uncle Joe lived to 95,

00:02:35.854 --> 00:02:37.081
the die have been cast."

00:02:37.105 --> 00:02:38.802
It's less important than you think.

00:02:38.826 --> 00:02:40.389
Number two is lifestyle.

00:02:40.413 --> 00:02:42.680
Don't smoke, don't be obese,
and prescreen --

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:45.659
get rid of about two-thirds
of early cancers

00:02:45.683 --> 00:02:47.188
and cardiovascular disease.

00:02:47.212 --> 00:02:50.776
The number one indicator or signal
that you'll make it to triple digits:

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.938
How many people do you love?

00:02:54.702 --> 00:02:57.527
Caretaking is the security camera --

00:02:57.551 --> 00:03:00.471
we call the low-resolution
security camera in our brain --

00:03:00.495 --> 00:03:02.679
deciding whether or not
you are adding value.

00:03:02.703 --> 00:03:06.340
Facebook taps into our instinctive need
not only to be loved,

00:03:06.364 --> 00:03:07.567
but to love others,

00:03:07.591 --> 00:03:09.668
mostly through pictures
that create empathy,

00:03:09.692 --> 00:03:12.200
catalyze and reinforce our relationships.

00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:15.117
Let's continue our journey down the torso.

00:03:15.741 --> 00:03:17.869
Amazon is our consumptive gut.

00:03:18.201 --> 00:03:21.396
The instinct of more is hardwired into us.

00:03:21.777 --> 00:03:25.780
The penalty for too little
is starvation and malnutrition.

00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:27.993
Open your cupboards, open your closets,

00:03:28.017 --> 00:03:31.410
you have 10 to 100x times what you need.

00:03:31.434 --> 00:03:32.597
Why?

00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:35.383
Because the penalty
for too little is much greater

00:03:35.407 --> 00:03:37.290
than the penalty for too much.

00:03:37.314 --> 00:03:41.148
So "more for less" is a business strategy
that never goes out of style.

00:03:41.172 --> 00:03:42.678
It's the strategy of China,

00:03:42.702 --> 00:03:44.320
it's a the strategy of Walmart,

00:03:44.344 --> 00:03:47.729
and now it's the strategy of the most
successful company in the world,

00:03:47.753 --> 00:03:48.913
Amazon.

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.081
You get more for less into your gut;

00:03:51.105 --> 00:03:54.887
digest, send it to your muscular
and skeletal system of consumption.

00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:56.566
Moving further,

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.195
once we know we will survive,
the basic instinct,

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.661
we move to the second
most powerful instinct,

00:04:02.685 --> 00:04:07.402
and that is to spread and select
the strongest, smartest and fastest seed

00:04:07.426 --> 00:04:09.149
to the four corners of the earth,

00:04:09.173 --> 00:04:11.513
or pick the best seed.

00:04:11.537 --> 00:04:13.261
This is not a timepiece.

00:04:13.285 --> 00:04:15.375
I haven't wound it in five years.

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:17.622
It's my vain attempt to say to people,

00:04:17.646 --> 00:04:20.765
"If you mate with me,
your children are more likely to survive

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:23.433
than if you mate with someone
wearing a Swatch watch."

00:04:23.457 --> 00:04:25.049
(Laughter)

00:04:25.073 --> 00:04:29.464
The key to business is tapping into
the irrational organs.

00:04:29.488 --> 00:04:33.224
"Irrational" is Harvard Business School's
and New York Business School's term

00:04:33.248 --> 00:04:36.765
for fat profit margins
and shareholder value.

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.349
"High-caloric paste for your children."

00:04:39.373 --> 00:04:40.539
No?

00:04:40.563 --> 00:04:42.796
You love your choosy mom.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.010
Why choosy moms choose Jif:
you love your kids more.

00:04:46.034 --> 00:04:49.131
The greatest algorithm for shareholder
creation from World War II

00:04:49.155 --> 00:04:50.508
to the advent of Google

00:04:50.532 --> 00:04:53.632
was taking an average product
and appealing to people's hearts.

00:04:53.656 --> 00:04:56.974
You're a better a mom,
a better person, a better patriot

00:04:56.998 --> 00:05:00.314
if you buy this average soap
versus this average soap.

00:05:00.338 --> 00:05:03.749
Now, the number one algorithm
for shareholder value isn't technology.

00:05:03.773 --> 00:05:05.003
Look at the Forbes 400.

00:05:05.027 --> 00:05:07.459
Take out inherited wealth,
take out finance.

00:05:07.483 --> 00:05:09.696
The number one source of wealth creation:

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.829
appealing to your reproductive organs.

00:05:11.853 --> 00:05:16.734
The Lauders; the number
one wealthiest man in Europe, LVMH.

00:05:16.758 --> 00:05:19.335
Numbers two and three: H&amp;M and Inditex.

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:24.635
You want to target the most
irrational organs for shareholder value.

00:05:25.362 --> 00:05:29.129
As a result, these four companies --
Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google --

00:05:29.153 --> 00:05:30.864
have disarticulated who we are.

00:05:30.888 --> 00:05:33.181
God, love, consumption, sex.

00:05:33.205 --> 00:05:36.868
The proportion in your approach
to those things is who you are,

00:05:36.892 --> 00:05:40.637
and they have reassembled who we are
in the form of for-profit companies.

00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:42.509
At the end of the Great Recession,

00:05:42.533 --> 00:05:45.395
the market capitalization
of these companies was equivalent

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:46.572
to the GDP of Niger.

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:49.220
Now it is equivalent to the GDP of India,

00:05:49.244 --> 00:05:52.599
having blown past
Russia and Canada in '13 and '14.

00:05:52.623 --> 00:05:53.982
There are only five nations

00:05:54.006 --> 00:05:57.525
that have a GDP greater
than the combined market capitalization

00:05:57.549 --> 00:05:59.266
of these four firms.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.428
Something is happening, though.

00:06:01.915 --> 00:06:06.317
The conversation just a year ago
was, which CEO was more Jesus-like?

00:06:06.341 --> 00:06:08.755
Who was running for president?

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:10.220
Now the worm has turned.

00:06:10.244 --> 00:06:12.462
Everything they're doing is bothering us.

00:06:12.486 --> 00:06:14.446
We're worried they're tax avoiders.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.853
Walmart, since the Great Recession,
has paid 64 billion dollars

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:19.410
in corporate income tax;

00:06:19.434 --> 00:06:21.433
Amazon has paid 1.4.

00:06:21.788 --> 00:06:25.370
How do we pay our firefighters,
our soldiers and our social workers

00:06:25.394 --> 00:06:28.879
if the most successful companies
in the world don't pay their fair share?

00:06:28.903 --> 00:06:30.066
Pretty easy.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.629
That means the less successful
companies have to pay

00:06:32.653 --> 00:06:33.970
more than their fair share.

00:06:33.994 --> 00:06:35.825
Alexa, is this a good thing?

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:37.817
This is despite that fact --

00:06:37.841 --> 00:06:38.916
(Laughter)

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.856
This is despite the fact

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:45.675
that Amazon has added the entire
market capitalization of Walmart

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:49.822
to its market cap in the last 19 months.

00:06:52.423 --> 00:06:54.647
Whose fault is it? It's our fault.

00:06:54.671 --> 00:06:58.489
We're electing regulators
who don't have the backbone

00:06:58.513 --> 00:07:00.940
to actually go after these companies.

00:07:00.964 --> 00:07:02.966
Facebook lies to EU regulators

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.071
and says, "It would be impossible
for us to share the data

00:07:06.095 --> 00:07:09.891
between our core platform
and our proposed acquisition of WhatsApp.

00:07:09.915 --> 00:07:11.298
Approve the merger."

00:07:11.322 --> 00:07:15.109
They approve the merger and then --
spoiler alert! -- they figure it out.

00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:16.847
And the EU says, "I feel lied to.

00:07:16.871 --> 00:07:20.258
We're fining you 120 [million] dollars,"

00:07:20.282 --> 00:07:24.547
about .6 percent of the acquisition price
of 19 billion dollars.

00:07:24.571 --> 00:07:27.174
If Mark Zuckerberg could take out
an insurance policy

00:07:27.198 --> 00:07:29.920
that the acquisition would
go through for .6 percent,

00:07:29.944 --> 00:07:31.303
wouldn't he do it?

00:07:31.327 --> 00:07:33.145
Anticompetitive behavior.

00:07:33.622 --> 00:07:35.622
A two-and-a-half-billion-dollar fine,

00:07:35.646 --> 00:07:38.538
three billion of the cash flow,

00:07:38.562 --> 00:07:41.607
three percent of the cash
on Google's balance sheet.

00:07:41.631 --> 00:07:44.943
We are telling these companies,
"The smart thing to do,

00:07:45.596 --> 00:07:47.561
the shareholder-driven thing to do,

00:07:47.585 --> 00:07:49.900
is to lie and to cheat."

00:07:49.924 --> 00:07:53.572
We are issuing 25-cent parking tickets

00:07:53.596 --> 00:07:56.823
on a meter that costs 100 dollars an hour.

00:07:56.847 --> 00:07:57.927
The smart thing to do is lie.

00:07:57.957 --> 00:07:59.477
Job destruction!

00:07:59.507 --> 00:08:02.808
Amazon only needs one person
for two at Macy's.

00:08:02.832 --> 00:08:06.473
If they grow their business 20 billion
dollars this year, which they will,

00:08:06.497 --> 00:08:08.682
we will lose 53,000 cashiers and clerks.

00:08:08.706 --> 00:08:09.967
This is nothing unusual;

00:08:09.991 --> 00:08:12.303
this has happened all through our economy,

00:08:12.327 --> 00:08:14.589
we've just never seen
companies this good at it.

00:08:14.613 --> 00:08:16.891
That's one Yankee Stadium of workers.

00:08:16.915 --> 00:08:18.282
It's even worse in media.

00:08:18.306 --> 00:08:20.416
If Facebook and Google
grow their businesses

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.615
22 billion dollars this year,
which they will,

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:26.270
we're going to lose approximately
150,000 creative directors,

00:08:26.294 --> 00:08:28.267
planners and copywriters.

00:08:28.291 --> 00:08:30.601
Or we can fill up two-and-a-half
Yankee Stadiums

00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:34.016
and say, "You are out of work,
courtesy of Amazon."

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.290
We now get the majority of our news
from our social media feeds,

00:08:37.314 --> 00:08:41.587
and the majority of our news
coming off of social media feeds is ...

00:08:41.611 --> 00:08:42.911
fake news.

00:08:42.935 --> 00:08:44.622
(Laughter)

00:08:44.646 --> 00:08:48.250
I am not allowed to be political
or use curse words,

00:08:48.274 --> 00:08:49.961
or talk about religion in class,

00:08:49.985 --> 00:08:52.441
so I can definitely not say,

00:08:53.473 --> 00:08:56.034
"Zuckerberg has become Putin's bitch."

00:08:56.058 --> 00:08:58.284
I definitely cannot say that.

00:08:58.308 --> 00:08:59.321
(Laughter)

00:08:59.345 --> 00:09:00.524
Their defense:

00:09:00.548 --> 00:09:03.923
"Facebook is not a media company;
it's a technology company."

00:09:03.947 --> 00:09:05.621
You create original content,

00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:08.541
you pay sports leagues
to give you original content,

00:09:08.565 --> 00:09:11.679
you run advertising against it --
boom! -- you're a media company.

00:09:11.703 --> 00:09:13.230
Just in the last few days,

00:09:13.254 --> 00:09:17.863
Sheryl Sandberg has repeated this lie,
that "We are not a media company."

00:09:17.887 --> 00:09:21.332
Facebook has openly embraced
the margins of celebrity

00:09:21.356 --> 00:09:23.730
and the influence of a media company

00:09:23.754 --> 00:09:27.441
yet seems to be allergic
to the responsibilities

00:09:27.465 --> 00:09:28.765
of a media company.

00:09:29.138 --> 00:09:30.746
Imagine McDonald's.

00:09:31.293 --> 00:09:33.722
We find 80 percent of their beef is fake,

00:09:33.746 --> 00:09:35.367
and it's giving us encephalitis,

00:09:35.391 --> 00:09:37.777
and we're making terrible decisions.

00:09:37.801 --> 00:09:40.629
And we say, "McDonald's,
we're pissed off!"

00:09:40.653 --> 00:09:43.584
And they say, "Wait, wait --

00:09:43.608 --> 00:09:45.460
we're not a fast-food restaurant,

00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:47.717
we're a fast-food platform."

00:09:47.741 --> 00:09:49.521
(Laughter)

00:09:50.307 --> 00:09:52.646
These companies and CEOs wrap themselves

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.528
in a neon-blue pink rainbow
and blue blanket

00:09:56.552 --> 00:09:59.901
to create an illusionist trick
from their behavior each day,

00:09:59.925 --> 00:10:04.396
which is more indicative
of the spawn of Darth Vader and Ayn Rand.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:08.488
Why? Because we as progressives
are seen as nice but weak.

00:10:09.045 --> 00:10:12.399
If Sheryl Sandberg had written
a book on gun rights

00:10:12.423 --> 00:10:14.827
or on the pro-life movement,

00:10:14.851 --> 00:10:17.832
would they be flying Sheryl to Cannes?

00:10:17.856 --> 00:10:19.014
No.

00:10:19.038 --> 00:10:21.182
And I'm not doubting
their progressive values,

00:10:21.206 --> 00:10:23.278
but it foots to shareholder value,

00:10:23.302 --> 00:10:25.371
because we as progressives
are seen as weak.

00:10:25.395 --> 00:10:27.803
They're so nice -- remember Microsoft?

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:29.324
They didn't seem as nice,

00:10:29.348 --> 00:10:33.621
and regulators stepped in much earlier
than the regulators now,

00:10:33.645 --> 00:10:37.330
who would never step in
on those nice, nice people.

00:10:37.354 --> 00:10:39.160
I'm about to get on a plane tonight,

00:10:39.184 --> 00:10:41.902
and I'm going to have a guy
named Roy from TSA molest me.

00:10:41.926 --> 00:10:45.107
If I am suspected of a DUI
on the way home,

00:10:45.131 --> 00:10:47.799
I can have blood taken from my person.

00:10:48.554 --> 00:10:51.622
But wait! Don't tap into the iPhone --

00:10:51.646 --> 00:10:53.066
it's sacred.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:54.529
This is our new cross.

00:10:54.553 --> 00:10:56.162
It shouldn't be the iPhone X,

00:10:56.186 --> 00:10:58.182
it should be called the "iPhone Cross."

00:10:58.206 --> 00:11:00.372
We have our religion; it's Apple.

00:11:00.396 --> 00:11:02.171
Our Jesus Christ is Steve Jobs,

00:11:02.195 --> 00:11:05.481
and we've decided this is holier
than our person, our house

00:11:05.505 --> 00:11:06.805
or our computer.

00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:09.346
We have become totally out of control

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:13.163
with the gross idolatry
of innovation and of youth.

00:11:13.187 --> 00:11:15.658
We no longer worship
at the altar of character,

00:11:15.682 --> 00:11:16.839
of kindness,

00:11:16.863 --> 00:11:20.441
but of innovation and people
who create shareholder value.

00:11:20.465 --> 00:11:23.359
Amazon has become so powerful
in the marketplace,

00:11:23.383 --> 00:11:24.945
it can conduct Jedi mind tricks.

00:11:24.969 --> 00:11:27.959
It can begin damaging other industries
just by looking at them.

00:11:27.983 --> 00:11:31.147
Nike announces they're distributing
on Amazon, their stock goes up,

00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:32.977
every other footwear stock goes down.

00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:36.010
When Amazon stock goes up,
the rest of retail stocks go down,

00:11:36.034 --> 00:11:39.343
because they assume what's good
for Amazon is bad for everybody else.

00:11:39.367 --> 00:11:43.736
They cut the cost on salmon 33 percent
when they acquired Whole Foods.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.867
In between the time they announced
the acquisition of Whole Foods

00:11:46.891 --> 00:11:48.065
and when it closed,

00:11:48.089 --> 00:11:50.360
Kroger, the largest
pure-play grocer in America,

00:11:50.384 --> 00:11:52.119
shed a third of its value,

00:11:52.143 --> 00:11:58.522
because Amazon purchased a grocer
one-eleventh the size of Kroger.

00:11:59.167 --> 00:12:00.395
I got very lucky.

00:12:00.419 --> 00:12:03.836
I predicted the acquisition
of Whole Foods by Amazon

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.204
the week before it happened.

00:12:05.228 --> 00:12:07.916
This is me boasting; I said
this publicly in the media.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.321
This was the largest
acquisition in their history,

00:12:10.345 --> 00:12:12.680
they'd never made
an acquisition over a billion,

00:12:12.704 --> 00:12:14.822
and people asked, "How did you know this?"

00:12:14.846 --> 00:12:18.065
So I'm letting this very impressive
audience in on the secret.

00:12:18.089 --> 00:12:19.284
How did I know this?

00:12:19.308 --> 00:12:21.278
I'm going to tell you how I knew.

00:12:21.302 --> 00:12:24.052
I bark at Alexa all day long

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:25.988
and try to figure out what's going on.

00:12:26.012 --> 00:12:29.408
(Scott Galloway) Alexa, buy whole milk.

00:12:29.432 --> 00:12:31.699
(Alexa) I couldn't find
anything for whole milk,

00:12:31.723 --> 00:12:33.966
so I've added whole milk
to your shopping list.

00:12:34.463 --> 00:12:35.749
SG: Then I asked,

00:12:35.773 --> 00:12:38.915
(SG) Alexa, buy organic foods.

00:12:38.939 --> 00:12:41.082
(Alexa) The top search result
for organic food

00:12:41.106 --> 00:12:44.079
is Plum Organics baby food,
banana and pumpkin,

00:12:44.103 --> 00:12:46.120
12-pack of four ounces each.

00:12:46.144 --> 00:12:47.767
It's 15 dollars total.

00:12:48.419 --> 00:12:49.612
Would you like to buy it?

00:12:49.636 --> 00:12:51.635
SG: And then, as often happens at my age,

00:12:51.659 --> 00:12:52.819
I got confused.

00:12:52.843 --> 00:12:55.633
(SG) Alexa, buy whole foods.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.584
(Alexa) I have purchased the outstanding
stock of Whole Foods Incorporated

00:12:59.608 --> 00:13:01.397
at 42 dollars per share.

00:13:01.421 --> 00:13:05.282
I have charged 13.7 billion
to your American Express card.

00:13:05.306 --> 00:13:06.686
(Laughter)

00:13:07.884 --> 00:13:09.491
SG: I thought that'd be funnier.

00:13:09.515 --> 00:13:11.013
(Laughter)

00:13:11.037 --> 00:13:12.720
We've personified these companies,

00:13:12.744 --> 00:13:16.179
and just as when you're really angry
over every little thing someone does

00:13:16.203 --> 00:13:17.698
in your life and relationships,

00:13:17.722 --> 00:13:19.026
you've got to ask yourself,

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:22.100
"What's going on here?
Why are we so disappointed in technology?"

00:13:22.124 --> 00:13:24.803
I believe it's because the ratio
of one-percent pursuit

00:13:24.827 --> 00:13:25.994
of shareholder value

00:13:26.018 --> 00:13:28.559
and 99 percent the betterment of humanity

00:13:28.583 --> 00:13:29.968
that technology used to play

00:13:29.992 --> 00:13:31.147
has been flipped,

00:13:31.171 --> 00:13:34.538
and now we're totally focused
on shareholder value instead of humanity.

00:13:34.562 --> 00:13:37.841
One hundred thousand people came together
for the Manhattan Project

00:13:37.865 --> 00:13:39.326
and literally saved the world.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:40.661
Technology saved the world.

00:13:40.685 --> 00:13:44.372
My mother was a four-year-old Jew
living in London at the outset of the war.

00:13:44.396 --> 00:13:47.501
If we had not won the footrace
towards splitting the atom,

00:13:47.525 --> 00:13:49.213
would she have survived?

00:13:49.237 --> 00:13:50.400
It's unlikely.

00:13:50.854 --> 00:13:52.161
Twenty-five years later,

00:13:52.185 --> 00:13:56.618
the most impressive accomplishment,
arguably, ever in all of humankind:

00:13:56.642 --> 00:13:57.794
put a man on the moon.

00:13:57.818 --> 00:14:01.442
Four hundred thirty thousand Canadians,
British and Americans came together,

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:03.297
again, with very basic technology,

00:14:03.321 --> 00:14:04.639
and put a man on the moon.

00:14:04.663 --> 00:14:08.270
Now we have the 700,000
best and brightest,

00:14:08.294 --> 00:14:11.739
and these are the best and brightest
from the four corners of the earth.

00:14:11.763 --> 00:14:15.843
They are literally playing with lasers
relative to slingshots,

00:14:15.867 --> 00:14:17.154
relative to the squirt gun.

00:14:17.178 --> 00:14:19.450
They have the GDP of India to work at.

00:14:19.474 --> 00:14:22.004
And after studying
these companies for 10 years,

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:23.684
I know what their mission is.

00:14:23.708 --> 00:14:26.332
Is it to organize the world's information?

00:14:26.356 --> 00:14:27.861
Is it to connect us?

00:14:27.885 --> 00:14:30.809
Is it to create greater comity of man?

00:14:30.833 --> 00:14:31.995
It isn't.

00:14:32.019 --> 00:14:33.915
I know why we have brought together --

00:14:33.939 --> 00:14:38.248
I know that the greatest collection
of IQ capital and creativity,

00:14:38.272 --> 00:14:40.126
that their sole mission is:

00:14:40.286 --> 00:14:42.416
to sell another fucking Nissan.

00:14:42.466 --> 00:14:46.213
My name is Scott Galloway, I teach at NYU,
and I appreciate your time.

00:14:46.237 --> 00:14:50.580
(Applause)

00:14:54.654 --> 00:14:56.129
Chris Anderson: Not planned,

00:14:56.153 --> 00:14:59.113
but you prompted
some questions in me, Scott.

00:14:59.137 --> 00:15:00.208
(Laughter)

00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:02.540
That was a spectacular rant.

00:15:02.564 --> 00:15:03.929
SG: Is this like Letterman?

00:15:03.953 --> 00:15:06.869
When you do well,
he calls you onto the couch?

00:15:06.893 --> 00:15:10.560
CA: No, no, you're going to the heart
of the conversation right now.

00:15:10.584 --> 00:15:16.718
Everyone's aware that after years
of worshipping Silicon Valley,

00:15:16.742 --> 00:15:18.596
suddenly the worm has turned

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.154
and in such a big way.

00:15:20.178 --> 00:15:23.583
To some people here, it will just feel
like you're piling on,

00:15:23.607 --> 00:15:26.997
you're kicking the kids who've already
been kicked to pieces anyway.

00:15:27.021 --> 00:15:29.386
Don't you feel any empathy
for them at all?

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:30.807
SG: None whatsoever.

00:15:31.259 --> 00:15:33.206
Look, this is the issue:

00:15:33.682 --> 00:15:35.495
it's not their fault, it's our fault.

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:37.635
They're for-profit companies.

00:15:37.659 --> 00:15:40.206
They're not concerned
with the condition of our souls.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.818
They're not going to take care of us
when we get older.

00:15:42.842 --> 00:15:46.584
We have set up a society that values
shareholder value over everything,

00:15:46.608 --> 00:15:49.051
and they're doing what
they're supposed to be doing.

00:15:49.075 --> 00:15:50.444
But we need to elect people,

00:15:50.468 --> 00:15:52.552
and we need to force
ourselves to force them

00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:54.247
to be subject to the same scrutiny

00:15:54.271 --> 00:15:56.399
that the rest of business
endures, full stop.

00:15:56.423 --> 00:15:58.145
CA: There's another narrative

00:15:58.169 --> 00:16:01.792
that is arguably equally
consistent with the facts,

00:16:01.816 --> 00:16:08.648
which is that there actually is good
intent in much of the leadership --

00:16:08.672 --> 00:16:10.423
I won't say everyone, necessarily --

00:16:10.447 --> 00:16:12.018
many of the employees.

00:16:12.042 --> 00:16:15.116
We all know people who work
in those companies,

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.906
and they still are pretty convincing
that their mission is to --

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:22.168
so, the alternative narrative
is that there have been

00:16:22.192 --> 00:16:24.264
unintended consequences here,

00:16:24.288 --> 00:16:26.382
that the technologies
that we're unleashing,

00:16:26.406 --> 00:16:30.984
the algorithms, that we're attempting
to personalize the internet, for example,

00:16:31.008 --> 00:16:37.317
have A, resulted in weird effects
like filter bubbles

00:16:37.341 --> 00:16:38.835
that we weren't expecting;

00:16:38.859 --> 00:16:41.925
and B, made themselves vulnerable
to weird things like --

00:16:41.949 --> 00:16:44.645
oh, I don't know, Russian
hackers creating accounts

00:16:44.669 --> 00:16:46.644
and doing things that we didn't expect.

00:16:46.668 --> 00:16:51.700
Isn't the unintended consequence
a possibility here?

00:16:51.724 --> 00:16:52.930
SG: I don't think --

00:16:52.954 --> 00:16:54.486
I'm pretty sure, statistically,

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:57.376
they're no less or better people
than any other organization

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.937
that has 100,000 or more people.

00:16:58.961 --> 00:17:00.569
I don't think they're bad people.

00:17:00.593 --> 00:17:02.222
As a matter of fact, I would argue

00:17:02.246 --> 00:17:05.066
that there's a lot of very
civic-minded, decent leadership.

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:06.254
But this is the issue:

00:17:06.278 --> 00:17:10.517
when you control 90 percent
points of share in a market, search,

00:17:10.541 --> 00:17:14.076
that is now bigger than the entire
advertising market of any nation,

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:17.810
and you're primarily compensated
and trying to develop economic security

00:17:17.834 --> 00:17:19.866
for you and the families
of your employees,

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.345
to increase that market share,

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:24.498
you can't help but leverage
all the power at your disposal.

00:17:24.522 --> 00:17:26.439
And that is the basis for regulation,

00:17:26.463 --> 00:17:28.919
and it's the basis for the truism
throughout history

00:17:28.943 --> 00:17:30.286
that power corrupts.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.513
They're not bad people;

00:17:31.537 --> 00:17:33.769
we've just let them get out of control.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:38.344
CA: So maybe the case
is slightly overstated?

00:17:38.368 --> 00:17:40.688
I know at least a bit --

00:17:40.712 --> 00:17:42.686
Larry Page, for example, Jeff Bezos --

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.379
I don't actually believe
they wake up thinking,

00:17:45.403 --> 00:17:47.231
"I've got to sell a fucking Nissan."

00:17:47.255 --> 00:17:48.764
I don't think they think that.

00:17:48.788 --> 00:17:54.344
I think they are trying to build
something cool, and are probably,

00:17:54.368 --> 00:17:55.688
in moments of reflection,

00:17:55.712 --> 00:17:59.583
as horrified that some of the things
that have happened as we might be.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:03.655
So is there a different way
of framing this,

00:18:04.294 --> 00:18:09.491
to say that when your model
is advertising,

00:18:09.515 --> 00:18:14.022
that there are dangers there
that you have to take on more explicitly?

00:18:14.637 --> 00:18:19.274
SG: I think it's very difficult
to set an organization up as we do,

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:21.477
to pursue shareholder value
above all else.

00:18:21.501 --> 00:18:22.798
They're not non-profits.

00:18:22.822 --> 00:18:26.385
The reason people go to work there
is they want to create economic security

00:18:26.409 --> 00:18:27.783
for them and their families,

00:18:27.807 --> 00:18:29.107
mostly first and foremost.

00:18:29.131 --> 00:18:32.424
And when you get to a point where
you control so much economic power,

00:18:32.448 --> 00:18:34.844
you use all the weapons at your disposal.

00:18:34.868 --> 00:18:36.454
I don't think they're bad people,

00:18:36.478 --> 00:18:39.619
but I think the role of government
and the role of us as consumers

00:18:39.643 --> 00:18:41.318
and people who elect our officials

00:18:41.342 --> 00:18:43.490
is to ensure that there
are some checks here.

00:18:43.514 --> 00:18:46.030
And we have given
them the mother of all hall passes

00:18:46.054 --> 00:18:48.106
because we find them just so fascinating.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.288
CA: Scott, eloquently put,
spectacularly put.

00:18:51.312 --> 00:18:56.706
Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos,
Larry Page, Tim Cook, if you're watching,

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.709
you're welcome to come and make
the counterargument as well.

00:18:59.733 --> 00:19:00.961
Scott, thank you so much.

00:19:00.985 --> 00:19:02.146
SG: Thanks very much.

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:04.541
(Applause)
