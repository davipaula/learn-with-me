00:00:07.544 --> 00:00:10.872
After witnessing the violent rage
shown by babies

00:00:10.872 --> 00:00:14.943
whenever deprived of an item
they considered their own,

00:00:14.943 --> 00:00:18.624
Jean Piaget, a founding father
of child psychology,

00:00:18.624 --> 00:00:22.465
observed something profound
about human nature.

00:00:22.465 --> 00:00:26.654
Our sense of ownership emerges
incredibly early.

00:00:26.654 --> 00:00:28.903
Why are we so clingy?

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:31.483
There's a well-established phenomenon
in psychology

00:00:31.483 --> 00:00:34.104
known as the endowment effect

00:00:34.104 --> 00:00:38.854
where we value items much more highly
just as soon as we own them.

00:00:38.854 --> 00:00:40.834
In one famous demonstration,

00:00:40.834 --> 00:00:43.425
students were given a choice
between a coffee mug

00:00:43.425 --> 00:00:45.557
or a Swiss chocolate bar

00:00:45.557 --> 00:00:48.605
as a reward for helping out with research.

00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:51.615
Half chose the mug,
and half chose the chocolate.

00:00:51.615 --> 00:00:55.755
That is, they seemed to value
the two rewards similarly.

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:58.044
Other students were given a mug first

00:00:58.044 --> 00:01:02.367
and then a surprise chance to swap it
for a chocolate bar,

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:05.405
but only 11% wanted to.

00:01:05.405 --> 00:01:07.757
Yet another group 
started out with chocolate,

00:01:07.757 --> 00:01:10.886
and most preferred to keep it
rather than swap.

00:01:10.886 --> 00:01:14.646
In other words, the students nearly
always put greater value

00:01:14.646 --> 00:01:18.126
on whichever reward they started out with.

00:01:18.126 --> 00:01:21.235
Part of this has to do with how quickly
we form connections

00:01:21.235 --> 00:01:25.616
between our sense of self
and the things we consider ours.

00:01:25.616 --> 00:01:28.707
That can even be seen at the neural level.

00:01:28.707 --> 00:01:32.527
In one experiment, neuroscientists scanned
participants' brains

00:01:32.527 --> 00:01:37.297
while they allocated various objects
either to a basket labeled "mine,"

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:40.216
or another labeled, "Alex's."

00:01:40.216 --> 00:01:43.061
When participants subsequently looked at
their new things,

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:45.786
their brains showed more activity

00:01:45.786 --> 00:01:48.205
in a region that usually 
flickers into life

00:01:48.205 --> 00:01:50.838
whenever we think about ourselves.

00:01:50.838 --> 00:01:53.247
Another reason we're so fond
of our possessions

00:01:53.247 --> 00:01:57.388
is that from a young age
we believe they have a unique essence.

00:01:57.388 --> 00:02:00.556
Psychologists showed us this by using
an illusion

00:02:00.556 --> 00:02:05.127
to convince three to six-year-olds
they built a copying machine,

00:02:05.127 --> 00:02:09.188
a device that could create perfect
replicas of any item.

00:02:09.188 --> 00:02:11.538
When offered a choice between 
their favorite toy

00:02:11.538 --> 00:02:14.058
or an apparently exact copy,

00:02:14.058 --> 00:02:17.319
the majority of the children
favored the original.

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.589
In fact, they were often horrified
at the prospect of taking home a copy.

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:26.588
This magical thinking about objects
isn't something we grow out of.

00:02:26.588 --> 00:02:31.541
Rather it persists into adulthood
while becoming ever more elaborate.

00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:34.810
For example, consider the huge value
placed on items

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.279
that have been owned by celebrities.

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:40.100
It's as if the buyers believed the objects
they'd purchased

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.143
were somehow imbued with the essence
of their former celebrity owners.

00:02:45.143 --> 00:02:49.290
For similar reasons, many of us are
reluctant to part with family heirlooms

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.921
which help us feel connected
to lost loved ones.

00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:56.551
These beliefs can even alter 
our perception of the physical world

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:59.409
and change our athletic abilities.

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.930
Participants in a recent study were told
they were using a golf putter

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.150
once owned by the champion Ben Curtis.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.338
During the experiment,

00:03:07.338 --> 00:03:10.820
they perceived the hole as being 
about a centimeter larger

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.201
than controlled participants 
using a standard putter

00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:17.412
and they sank slightly more putts.

00:03:17.412 --> 00:03:22.381
Although feelings of ownership emerge
early in life, culture also plays a part.

00:03:22.381 --> 00:03:26.883
For example, it was recently discovered
that Hadza people of northern Tanzania

00:03:26.883 --> 00:03:28.901
who are isolated from modern culture

00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:31.582
don't exhibit the endowment effect.

00:03:31.582 --> 00:03:35.012
That's possibly because they live
in an egalitarian society

00:03:35.012 --> 00:03:37.362
where almost everything is shared.

00:03:37.362 --> 00:03:42.022
At the other extreme, sometimes our
attachment to our things can go too far.

00:03:42.022 --> 00:03:46.573
Part of the cause of hoarding disorder
is an exaggerated sense of responsibility

00:03:46.573 --> 00:03:49.622
and protectiveness 
toward one's belongings.

00:03:49.622 --> 00:03:54.882
That's why people with this condition find
it so difficult to throw anything away.

00:03:54.882 --> 00:03:56.673
What remains to be seen today

00:03:56.673 --> 00:03:59.583
is how the nature of our relationship
with our possessions

00:03:59.583 --> 00:04:02.901
will change with the rise 
of digital technologies.

00:04:02.901 --> 00:04:06.633
Many have forecast the demise
of physical books and music,

00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:09.431
but for now, at least, 
this seems premature.

00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:12.641
Perhaps there will always be something
uniquely satisfying

00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:17.253
about holding an object in our hands
and calling it our own.
