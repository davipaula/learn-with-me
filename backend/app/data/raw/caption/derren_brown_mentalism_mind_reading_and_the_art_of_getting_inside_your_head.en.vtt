00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:17.518
We are all trapped

00:00:17.542 --> 00:00:19.643
inside our own heads,

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:23.643
and our beliefs and our understandings
about the world are limited

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:25.393
by that perspective,

00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:28.583
which means we tell ourselves stories.

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:33.351
Right? So here we are
in this infinite data source.

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:36.351
There's an infinite number of things
that we could think about,

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:38.684
but we edit and delete.

00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:42.143
We choose what to think about,
what to pay attention to.

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.458
We make up a story ...

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.917
to make sense of what's going on,

00:00:50.125 --> 00:00:52.184
and we all get it wrong.

00:00:52.208 --> 00:00:55.434
Because we're all trying to navigate
with our own skewed compasses,

00:00:55.458 --> 00:00:57.059
and we all have our own baggage,

00:00:57.083 --> 00:01:00.268
but the stories themselves
are utterly convincing.

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:01.601
And we all do this,

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:04.518
and a lot of the stories
that we live by aren't even our own.

00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:07.268
The first ones we inherit
at a young age from our parents,

00:01:07.292 --> 00:01:09.393
who of course have
their own skewed beliefs,

00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:12.167
their own frustrations,
their own unlived lives.

00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:15.714
And for better or worse,
we take all that onboard,

00:01:15.724 --> 00:01:17.309
and then we go out into the world

00:01:17.339 --> 00:01:20.643
thinking maybe we have to
be successful to be loved;

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:24.309
or that we always have to put
other people's needs first;

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:28.393
or that we have some big terrible secret
we couldn't possible tell people.

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:30.393
And it's just fiction, it's just stories,

00:01:30.417 --> 00:01:33.309
and we'd worry a lot less
about what other people think of us

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:35.726
if we realized how seldom they do.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.226
(Laughter)

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.393
So I feel that magic is a great analogy
for how we edit reality and form a story

00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:49.059
and then mistake that story for the truth,

00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:52.309
and I've had a 20-year career in the UK

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:56.684
staging big psychological
experiments on TV,

00:01:56.708 --> 00:01:58.351
and now that's on Netflix.

00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:00.268
I also have a stage show.

00:02:00.292 --> 00:02:04.059
I've got my first Broadway show actually
coming up, called "Secret."

00:02:04.083 --> 00:02:06.086
Just throwing that out there. No pressure.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.101
(Laughter)

00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:09.309
That should be this year.

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:14.184
And I try to do something new
with mentalism, mentalism,

00:02:14.208 --> 00:02:19.375
which is the dubious art
of getting inside your head.

00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:25.059
So there was a heyday
for this kind of stage mind-reading,

00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:26.726
which was the 1930s.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.976
That's why I'm dressed like this,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
in my most un-TED-like garb.

00:02:32.292 --> 00:02:35.601
And there was an act,
an act known as the Oracle Act.

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:37.851
And in the Oracle Act,
members of the audience,

00:02:37.875 --> 00:02:39.476
as I know you have done,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.393
would write down secret questions,

00:02:41.417 --> 00:02:44.059
the sort of questions
you might ask a psychic,

00:02:44.083 --> 00:02:47.184
seal that question into an envelope,

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:50.351
and on the outside of the envelope
they would write their initials

00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:53.792
and then roughly
where they sat in the audience.

00:02:55.417 --> 00:02:58.976
And then the Oracle, the mind reader,
would take an envelope one at a time,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.309
he wouldn't open it,

00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:04.268
but he would attempt to divine
what question was sealed inside.

00:03:04.292 --> 00:03:07.393
And if he got that right,
he would try and answer the question

00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:08.851
for the person too.

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:11.309
And the act spread like wildfire.

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:14.934
It's a testament, I think,
to the seductive appeal

00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:18.768
of some powerful figure
offering you easy, simple answers

00:03:18.792 --> 00:03:21.268
to life's complex and subtle questions

00:03:21.292 --> 00:03:22.976
and anxieties.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.143
So thank you all of you
that wrote questions.

00:03:25.167 --> 00:03:27.726
I haven't seen these.
I know somebody's guarding them.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.059
Thank you so much.

00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:31.809
I will take those now.
Thank you all of you that did this.

00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:37.726
I should say, probably,
a couple of things before I start.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.125
In absolute honesty,

00:03:40.042 --> 00:03:42.351
first of all I can't see
through these envelopes.

00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:44.643
They are sealed.
They are thick black envelopes.

00:03:44.667 --> 00:03:47.268
You'll know if you wrote one.
I can't see through them.

00:03:47.292 --> 00:03:49.768
Secondly, importantly,
I don't know any of you

00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:51.809
and nobody is playing along.

00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:53.458
That's not what this is.

00:03:54.542 --> 00:03:55.792
Thirdly ...

00:03:57.542 --> 00:04:02.309
I don't believe for a second that I have
any special psychological gifts,

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:04.625
let alone any psychic ones.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.000
So let's begin.

00:04:12.542 --> 00:04:13.809
Nope.

00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:17.042
(Laughter)

00:04:20.375 --> 00:04:21.643
OK, this --

00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:23.309
Oh, nice.

00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:25.726
OK, this one's interesting.
There's a couple here.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.559
I will start with maybe this one.

00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:30.559
This one's interesting,
because the writing undulates.

00:04:30.583 --> 00:04:32.476
There's a sort of an up and down thing,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.684
which normally -- not always --
normally means

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:37.893
that the person doesn't know
the answer to the question themselves,

00:04:37.917 --> 00:04:40.393
so it's normally a question
about the future, right?

00:04:40.417 --> 00:04:42.059
That sort of suggests uncertainty.

00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:44.393
So I would say it's a lady,

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:47.809
age-wise it's a little difficult to tell
from this minimal handwriting,

00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:51.601
but I would expect maybe 30s,
maybe 40s, but let's find out.

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:53.724
It says -- and a question
about the future --

00:04:53.738 --> 00:04:57.184
it says, "JN, center."

00:04:57.208 --> 00:05:00.143
So it's going to be somebody
in this big central section here.

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:02.226
If you think this is you,
if you wrote one,

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.518
could you make a fuss?

00:05:03.542 --> 00:05:05.851
It's a bit difficult for me
to see in the center.

00:05:05.875 --> 00:05:07.143
Hi, give us a wave.

00:05:07.167 --> 00:05:08.476
So J ...

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.018
Jane? Jessica?

00:05:10.042 --> 00:05:11.309
Jessica: Yes.

00:05:11.333 --> 00:05:13.308
Derren Brown: Which one?
Jessica: Jessica.

00:05:13.322 --> 00:05:16.434
DB: Thank you. Just a guess.
Little murmur of approval, thank you?

00:05:16.458 --> 00:05:18.059
(Laughter)

00:05:18.083 --> 00:05:19.333
I'll take it.

00:05:20.583 --> 00:05:22.559
Alright, so Jessica,
I won't ask your age,

00:05:22.583 --> 00:05:24.934
but is it a question
essentially about the future?

00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.226
Jessica: Mhm?
DB: Yes?

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.518
Jessica: Yes.
DB: Yes. OK.

00:05:27.542 --> 00:05:32.518
Alright. So what did we ask?
What did Jessica ask about the future?

00:05:32.542 --> 00:05:36.976
So am I OK with late-30s, early-40s?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.809
Jessica: I'll take it. I'm taking it.

00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:41.125
(Laughter)

00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:44.018
DB: OK, so it's important,

00:05:44.042 --> 00:05:46.893
because we ask different questions
depending how old we are.

00:05:46.917 --> 00:05:48.934
Just say, "I'll take it" again.

00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:50.726
Jessica: I'll take it.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.809
DB: Virginia? You're from Virginia?
Jessica: Yes, I am.

00:05:53.833 --> 00:05:55.518
DB: Yeah. So --

00:05:55.542 --> 00:05:56.809
(Laughter)

00:05:56.833 --> 00:05:58.559
I think this is a lady,

00:05:58.583 --> 00:06:03.934
I think this is a lady
who wants to leave Virginia.

00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:06.518
I think you're looking at plans,

00:06:06.542 --> 00:06:09.601
it's whether or not things
are going to come together to get out.

00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:10.875
Just show me your hands.

00:06:12.042 --> 00:06:13.833
Other sides so I can see fingernails?

00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:19.059
OK, I think you have a farm

00:06:19.083 --> 00:06:22.809
and it's whether or not you're going
to sell your farm and get out of Virginia?

00:06:22.833 --> 00:06:24.101
Is this right?

00:06:24.125 --> 00:06:26.101
Jessica: Absolutely, that's the question.

00:06:26.125 --> 00:06:28.851
DB: Alright. Great. Thank you.
It's a great question!

00:06:28.875 --> 00:06:31.809
What was the actual question?
What did you put?

00:06:31.833 --> 00:06:33.934
Jessica: "Will I sell
the farm in Virginia?"

00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.268
DB: Will you sell the farm?

00:06:35.292 --> 00:06:38.893
Alright, so look, it's a great question
if you are pretending to be psychic,

00:06:38.917 --> 00:06:40.393
because it's about the future,

00:06:40.417 --> 00:06:42.643
which means I can give you
a yes or no on this.

00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:45.042
It means nothing.
You have no way of verifying it.

00:06:46.458 --> 00:06:47.934
And a dangerous thing to do --

00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:51.068
and if I say yes or no,
it'll just stick in the back of your mind,

00:06:51.082 --> 00:06:53.518
and it can't not start to affect
decisions you make.

00:06:53.542 --> 00:06:55.393
So a dangerous thing to do. However --

00:06:55.417 --> 00:06:57.768
(Laughter)

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:59.792
Yes, I think you will sell the farm,

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.476
because I think you're the sort of person

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.684
that in the nicest way
will get what you want.

00:07:05.708 --> 00:07:10.059
I think when there are things you want,
you tend to focus on them

00:07:10.083 --> 00:07:11.559
at the expense of other things

00:07:11.583 --> 00:07:14.143
that you know you probably
should be focusing on more,

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:15.458
would you agree?

00:07:16.708 --> 00:07:20.018
Educated, you spent a few years in --

00:07:20.042 --> 00:07:22.518
Say yes again, the word "yes" quickly?
Jessica: Yes.

00:07:22.542 --> 00:07:24.309
DB: No?
Jessica: No.

00:07:24.333 --> 00:07:26.726
DB: California? Berkeley?
A bit of a guess, but ...

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.643
Jessica: I went to Berkeley, yes.
Stop doing this!

00:07:29.667 --> 00:07:31.309
DB: So it's a yes.

00:07:31.333 --> 00:07:33.518
Oh, and you've been
to India recently as well.

00:07:33.542 --> 00:07:36.851
There's just a tiny, tiny little thing
going on there. Yes? No?

00:07:36.875 --> 00:07:38.851
Jessica: Yes, I just got back from India.

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:42.768
DB: It's a yes from me, I just don't want
to say it like it's written in the stars

00:07:42.792 --> 00:07:45.809
because it isn't, and you need
to take responsibility for it.

00:07:45.833 --> 00:07:48.143
DB: Have a seat.
Thank you. Let's do another one.

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:51.625
(Applause)

00:07:53.625 --> 00:07:56.934
AH, also in the center? AH.

00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:00.601
This will be a man, a little older,
maybe late 40s, I would say from this.

00:08:00.625 --> 00:08:03.500
AH, center, stand up for me
if you think this is you.

00:08:04.375 --> 00:08:06.559
AH. Hi, let's get
a microphone to this guy.

00:08:06.583 --> 00:08:09.101
Quick as we can,
on camera would be amazing.

00:08:09.125 --> 00:08:11.684
Oh, look at that! Freeze.
Don't move. Don't move.

00:08:11.708 --> 00:08:13.393
Keep absolutely still.

00:08:13.417 --> 00:08:14.976
Are you standing? Where are you?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.893
Man: I am standing. I'm not that short.

00:08:16.917 --> 00:08:18.167
DB: OK.

00:08:19.375 --> 00:08:21.684
Alright, now you changed that.

00:08:21.708 --> 00:08:23.934
There was just something
you did as you got up.

00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:26.976
Yes or no, have you
put something on here --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.726
you're not doing it now,
but you did it as you stood up --

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:34.268
to do with your left or your left leg
or your left foot, yes or no?

00:08:34.292 --> 00:08:35.559
Man: Yes.

00:08:35.583 --> 00:08:38.768
DB: Alright. He was giving us
a nice clear signal as he stood up.

00:08:38.792 --> 00:08:41.309
Put your weight on your
left-hand side and say "yes."

00:08:41.333 --> 00:08:42.601
Man: Yes.

00:08:42.625 --> 00:08:46.101
DB: Take your hand out of that pocket,
put your weight on the other side,

00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:48.313
change hands with the mic
and say "yes" again.

00:08:48.317 --> 00:08:49.476
Man: Yes.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:54.457
DB: You have a dislocation

00:08:55.707 --> 00:08:58.351
in the big toe on your left-hand side?

00:08:58.375 --> 00:08:59.643
Man: Yes.

00:08:59.667 --> 00:09:02.768
DB: Thank you so much. Great.
Good one! Take a seat. Take a seat.

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:05.934
Can I get the microphone?
I'm going to change microphone for this.

00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.500
Can I grab a mic up? Thank you.

00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:10.768
Thank you so much.
That would be great there.

00:09:10.792 --> 00:09:14.184
I'm going to change mic because,

00:09:14.208 --> 00:09:15.917
hopefully you can now still hear me?

00:09:17.208 --> 00:09:18.792
So I'm going to blindfold myself.

00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:26.518
And I'm doing this now so I don't
have the clues as you stand up.

00:09:26.542 --> 00:09:28.351
I can't see where you put your hands.

00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:30.601
I can't see how you respond
to what I'm saying.

00:09:30.625 --> 00:09:33.309
I can't see what the people
next to you are doing either.

00:09:33.333 --> 00:09:36.601
If they know the answers to the question,
that's always very helpful.

00:09:36.625 --> 00:09:38.101
I won't have those advantages,

00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:39.417
but strangely,

00:09:42.292 --> 00:09:44.309
this frees me up,

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:46.226
and I want this to free you up as well,

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.851
so if you didn't write a question

00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:50.643
but you wish that you had done,

00:09:50.667 --> 00:09:51.934
you can still take part.

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:55.143
The point of writing the question
is only that it just kind of gets

00:09:55.167 --> 00:09:57.893
a nice, clear, succinct
wording in your head.

00:09:57.917 --> 00:10:00.601
So if you can just find
a question in your head,

00:10:00.625 --> 00:10:02.829
make it clear and succinct,
just send it to me,

00:10:02.853 --> 00:10:05.643
and I'll try and do this now
without anything written down.

00:10:05.667 --> 00:10:08.601
So just start to form questions
but send me your name as well.

00:10:08.625 --> 00:10:10.684
"My name is," whatever that last guy was,

00:10:10.708 --> 00:10:14.518
and "what's strange about my feet,"
or whatever the question was.

00:10:14.542 --> 00:10:16.768
So name and question.

00:10:16.792 --> 00:10:20.018
There is somebody already,
I'm guessing you're quite near the front,

00:10:20.042 --> 00:10:23.976
because your name is quite clear.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.143
Feels like you're
in the center at the front.

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:27.809
OK, let me just ... Allan?

00:10:27.833 --> 00:10:29.226
Feels like there's an Allan.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.559
And you're going to be quite near
the front, vaguely central, I think.

00:10:32.583 --> 00:10:34.518
Feels like it's coming from right there.

00:10:34.542 --> 00:10:37.268
There's like a man, maybe early 60s,
something like that.

00:10:37.292 --> 00:10:38.559
Allan: Yes.

00:10:38.583 --> 00:10:40.476
DB: You've got a mic? Great, thank you.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.518
Allan, just say "stop" when I get to you
so that I know where you are,

00:10:44.542 --> 00:10:45.792
where to face.

00:10:47.417 --> 00:10:48.667
Allan: Stop.

00:10:49.292 --> 00:10:51.958
DB: You a Capricorn?
Allan: Yes.

00:10:53.458 --> 00:10:56.625
DB: So Allan has something in his head.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.476
Now, did you hear it,
hear the reserve in his voice?

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.476
It's going to be something really tricky.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.809
I think with you ...
Just say "yes" again for me?

00:11:04.833 --> 00:11:06.083
Allan: Yes.

00:11:08.042 --> 00:11:09.476
DB: It's going to be either --

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.768
no it's not.

00:11:10.792 --> 00:11:15.268
It's access, it's a password
or access to something.

00:11:15.292 --> 00:11:18.559
Have you got something, just yes or no,
with a password in your head?

00:11:18.583 --> 00:11:19.851
Allan: Yes.

00:11:19.875 --> 00:11:21.976
DB: A computer password,
that sort of thing?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.268
Allan: Yes.

00:11:23.292 --> 00:11:24.559
DB: Excellent!

00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:26.268
(Laughter)

00:11:26.292 --> 00:11:29.101
In that case, I'm going
to finish on this one. Let me ---

00:11:29.125 --> 00:11:30.976
If I get this right,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.434
they're all going to know what it is,
and millions of people potentially.

00:11:34.458 --> 00:11:35.934
You will change it, won't you?

00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.268
Allan: Of course.

00:11:37.292 --> 00:11:40.000
(Laughter)

00:11:40.958 --> 00:11:43.434
DB: Just say "of course" again?
Allan: Of course.

00:11:43.458 --> 00:11:46.559
DB: Alright. If it's a word --
I imagine it's a word, right --

00:11:46.583 --> 00:11:48.768
just see the password
written in front of you,

00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:50.684
big clear block capital letters,

00:11:50.708 --> 00:11:54.809
and as you look at it, think for me
of a letter somewhere in the middle,

00:11:54.833 --> 00:11:56.351
don't say it out loud,

00:11:56.375 --> 00:11:58.851
just get a letter in your head
that's in the middle.

00:11:58.875 --> 00:12:00.309
Have you got one?
Allan: Yeah.

00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:01.842
DB: OK, stick with that for me.

00:12:02.875 --> 00:12:05.268
Ah, you changed it, OK.

00:12:05.292 --> 00:12:06.684
You changed your mind there.

00:12:06.708 --> 00:12:08.000
I think you settled on a --

00:12:08.833 --> 00:12:10.333
I think that's a "B", yes?

00:12:11.125 --> 00:12:12.375
Allan: No.

00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:14.893
I didn't.

00:12:14.917 --> 00:12:16.601
DB: Then it's an "I"?
Allan: Correct.

00:12:16.625 --> 00:12:18.309
DB: But you had a B.
Allan: Yes.

00:12:18.333 --> 00:12:20.768
DB: Yeah, he changed his mind.
He changed his mind.

00:12:20.792 --> 00:12:22.101
(Laughter)

00:12:22.125 --> 00:12:25.059
So see it written there.

00:12:25.083 --> 00:12:27.893
Just keep saying it
to yourself in your head.

00:12:27.917 --> 00:12:29.375
Oh, you play drums, don't you.

00:12:30.167 --> 00:12:31.434
Allan: I do.

00:12:31.458 --> 00:12:34.393
DB: Just get that out of your head,
get that out of your head,

00:12:34.417 --> 00:12:36.184
just focus on this one thing for me.

00:12:36.208 --> 00:12:38.393
(Laughter)

00:12:38.417 --> 00:12:40.226
My job is to sell you a story, right?

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.101
I try and do this to all of you,
to get you to pay attention

00:12:43.125 --> 00:12:46.101
to one thing that I want you
to find important,

00:12:46.125 --> 00:12:48.309
ignore other things
that I want you to ignore,

00:12:48.333 --> 00:12:50.143
and then join up those narrative dots

00:12:50.167 --> 00:12:52.726
to tell yourself a certain story
about what I'm doing,

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.684
and this only works because
we are story-forming creatures,

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:57.309
which means we do this every day.

00:12:57.333 --> 00:13:00.101
We go out into this complex
and subtle world

00:13:00.125 --> 00:13:02.934
full of a complex and subtle people
like you and me, Allan,

00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:06.000
and we reduce them
to these neat characters

00:13:07.083 --> 00:13:09.351
that fit whatever story
we're telling ourselves,

00:13:09.375 --> 00:13:12.934
and we say, "She's insecure,"
"He's arrogant," "They can't be trusted."

00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:19.476
And these are just stories like the story
that I can somehow read your mind.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.059
You're thinking of selling your company
as well, aren't you, at the moment.

00:13:23.083 --> 00:13:24.351
Allan: Correct.

00:13:24.375 --> 00:13:27.018
DB: Which is something to do with skin?

00:13:27.042 --> 00:13:28.309
Allan: Yes.

00:13:28.333 --> 00:13:30.143
DB: Skin care or something like this.

00:13:30.167 --> 00:13:31.434
Allan: Uh, yes.

00:13:31.458 --> 00:13:33.726
DB: And I think the reason
why I love doing this

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.809
is that it reminds me at least
to try and be more alive and alert

00:13:36.833 --> 00:13:39.184
to the complexity
and the subtlety of what's real,

00:13:39.208 --> 00:13:42.351
that there's always other stuff
going on that we don't know about,

00:13:42.375 --> 00:13:45.309
and it means we can get less stuck,
we can be kinder to people

00:13:45.333 --> 00:13:48.434
because we can recognize
there's always fear behind their stress,

00:13:48.458 --> 00:13:50.518
so we don't need
to meet it as defensively,

00:13:50.542 --> 00:13:53.059
and we can start to see the stories
for what they are

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:56.518
and recognize that life
isn't all about us.

00:13:56.542 --> 00:13:57.792
Oh!

00:14:02.708 --> 00:14:05.143
Your password, where are you?
Where are you? Where is he?

00:14:05.167 --> 00:14:06.476
Allan: Right here.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.351
DB: Stand up for me.
Your password is "ariboy."

00:14:09.375 --> 00:14:12.518
A-r-i-b-o-y? Is that right?
Allan: That's correct.

00:14:12.542 --> 00:14:15.143
DB: Then thank you so much.
Thank you very much indeed.

00:14:15.167 --> 00:14:16.476
Thank you.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:20.625
(Applause)
