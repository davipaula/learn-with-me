00:00:06.742 --> 00:00:12.052
There are currently hundreds of thousands 
of people on transplant lists,

00:00:12.052 --> 00:00:16.399
waiting for critical organs like kidneys, 
hearts, and livers

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:18.449
that could save their lives.

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.609
Unfortunately,

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.619
there aren’t nearly enough donor organs 
available to fill that demand.

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.583
What if instead of waiting,

00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:31.123
we could create brand-new, customized 
organs from scratch?

00:00:31.123 --> 00:00:33.783
That’s the idea behind bioprinting,

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:38.063
a branch of regenerative medicine 
currently under development.

00:00:38.063 --> 00:00:41.273
We’re not able to print complex 
organs just yet,

00:00:41.273 --> 00:00:44.563
but simpler tissues including blood
vessels and tubes

00:00:44.563 --> 00:00:47.503
responsible for nutrient 
and waste exchange

00:00:47.503 --> 00:00:49.683
are already in our grasp.

00:00:49.683 --> 00:00:53.743
Bioprinting is a biological 
cousin of 3-D printing,

00:00:53.743 --> 00:00:57.479
a technique that deposits layers of 
material on top of each other

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:01.989
to construct a three-dimensional object 
one slice at a time.

00:01:01.991 --> 00:01:05.191
Instead of starting with metal, plastic, 
or ceramic,

00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:09.751
a 3-D printer for organs and 
tissues uses bioink:

00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:13.622
a printable material that 
contains living cells.

00:01:13.622 --> 00:01:18.892
The bulk of many bioinks are water-rich 
molecules called hydrogels.

00:01:18.892 --> 00:01:21.839
Mixed into those are 
millions of living cells

00:01:21.839 --> 00:01:26.679
as well as various chemicals that 
encourage cells to communicate and grow.

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:29.846
Some bioinks include a 
single type of cell,

00:01:29.846 --> 00:01:35.366
while others combine several different 
kinds to produce more complex structures.

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:37.740
Let’s say you want to print a meniscus,

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.910
which is a piece of cartilage in the knee

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.040
that keeps the shinbone and thighbone 
from grinding against each other.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.820
It’s made up of cells called chondrocytes,

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.520
and you’ll need a healthy supply of 
them for your bioink.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.320
These cells can come from donors whose
cell lines are replicated in a lab.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.339
Or they might originate from a 
patient’s own tissue

00:01:58.339 --> 00:02:03.489
to create a personalized meniscus less
likely to be rejected by their body.

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.416
There are several printing techniques,

00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:09.476
and the most popular is extrusion-based 
bioprinting.

00:02:09.476 --> 00:02:13.096
In this, bioink gets loaded into a 
printing chamber

00:02:13.096 --> 00:02:17.426
and pushed through a round nozzle 
attached to a printhead.

00:02:17.426 --> 00:02:23.526
It emerges from a nozzle that’s rarely 
wider than 400 microns in diameter,

00:02:23.526 --> 00:02:26.123
and can produce a continuous filament

00:02:26.123 --> 00:02:29.173
roughly the thickness 
of a human fingernail.

00:02:29.173 --> 00:02:33.433
A computerized image or file guides the 
placement of the strands,

00:02:33.433 --> 00:02:36.853
either onto a flat surface or into a 
liquid bath

00:02:36.853 --> 00:02:40.743
that’ll help hold the structure in place 
until it stabilizes.

00:02:40.743 --> 00:02:45.133
These printers are fast, producing the 
meniscus in about half an hour,

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:47.843
one thin strand at a time.

00:02:47.843 --> 00:02:51.533
After printing, some bioinks 
will stiffen immediately;

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:55.723
others need UV light or an additional 
chemical or physical process

00:02:55.723 --> 00:02:57.592
to stabilize the structure.

00:02:57.592 --> 00:02:59.972
If the printing process is successful,

00:02:59.972 --> 00:03:01.762
the cells in the synthetic tissue

00:03:01.762 --> 00:03:05.502
will begin to behave the same way
cells do in real tissue:

00:03:05.502 --> 00:03:09.702
signaling to each other, exchanging 
nutrients, and multiplying.

00:03:09.702 --> 00:03:13.912
We can already print relatively simple 
structures like this meniscus.

00:03:13.912 --> 00:03:17.561
Bioprinted bladders have also been 
successfully implanted,

00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:23.091
and printed tissue has promoted facial 
nerve regeneration in rats.

00:03:23.091 --> 00:03:26.942
Researchers have created lung tissue,
skin, and cartilage,

00:03:26.942 --> 00:03:33.672
as well as miniature, semi-functional 
versions of kidneys, livers, and hearts.

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:37.024
However, replicating the complex 
biochemical environment

00:03:37.024 --> 00:03:39.954
of a major organ 
is a steep challenge.

00:03:39.954 --> 00:03:42.984
Extrusion-based bioprinting may destroy

00:03:42.984 --> 00:03:47.754
a significant percentage of cells in the 
ink if the nozzle is too small,

00:03:47.754 --> 00:03:50.893
or if the printing pressure is too high.

00:03:50.893 --> 00:03:52.863
One of the most formidable challenges

00:03:52.863 --> 00:03:58.703
is how to supply oxygen and nutrients 
to all the cells in a full-size organ.

00:03:58.703 --> 00:04:01.390
That’s why the greatest successes so far

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.420
have been with structures 
that are flat or hollow—

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.920
and why researchers are busy 
developing ways

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.320
to incorporate blood vessels 
into bioprinted tissue.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.778
There’s tremendous potential to use 
bioprinting

00:04:13.778 --> 00:04:16.178
to save lives and advance our 
understanding

00:04:16.178 --> 00:04:19.208
of how our organs function 
in the first place.

00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:23.358
And the technology opens up a dizzying 
array of possibilities,

00:04:23.358 --> 00:04:27.258
such as printing tissues with 
embedded electronics.

00:04:27.258 --> 00:04:31.558
Could we one day engineer organs that 
exceed current human capability,

00:04:31.558 --> 00:04:35.925
or give ourselves features like 
unburnable skin?

00:04:35.925 --> 00:04:42.242
How long might we extend human life 
by printing and replacing our organs?

00:04:42.242 --> 00:04:44.754
And exactly who—and what—

00:04:44.754 --> 00:04:49.054
will have access to this technology 
and its incredible output?
