00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:14.214
Once every 12 months,

00:00:14.238 --> 00:00:17.686
the world's largest human migration
happens in China.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.039
Over the 40-day travel period
of Chinese New Year,

00:00:21.063 --> 00:00:23.991
three billion trips are taken,

00:00:24.015 --> 00:00:25.795
as families reunite and celebrate.

00:00:26.596 --> 00:00:28.871
Now, the most strenuous
of these trips are taken

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:32.152
by the country's 290 million
migrant workers,

00:00:32.176 --> 00:00:34.702
for many of whom
this is the one chance a year

00:00:34.726 --> 00:00:38.449
to go home and see parents
and their left-behind children.

00:00:39.358 --> 00:00:41.988
But the travel options are very limited;

00:00:42.012 --> 00:00:45.482
plane tickets cost nearly half
of their monthly salary.

00:00:45.506 --> 00:00:47.420
So most of them, they choose the train.

00:00:48.085 --> 00:00:50.545
Their average journey is 700 kilometers.

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:53.054
The average travel time
is 15 and a half hours.

00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:58.307
And the country's tracks
now have to handle 390 million travelers

00:00:58.331 --> 00:00:59.798
every Spring Festival.

00:01:00.688 --> 00:01:02.186
Until recently,

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.643
migrant workers would have to queue
for long hours -- sometimes days --

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:07.005
just to buy tickets,

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:09.997
often only to be fleeced by scalpers.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.996
And they still had to deal
with near-stampede conditions

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.844
when travel day finally arrived.

00:01:16.837 --> 00:01:19.593
But technology has started
to ease this experience.

00:01:19.617 --> 00:01:22.840
Mobile and digital tickets
now account for 70 percent of sales,

00:01:22.864 --> 00:01:25.117
greatly reducing the lines
at train stations.

00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:27.403
Digital ID scanners
have replaced manual checks,

00:01:27.427 --> 00:01:29.696
expediting the boarding process,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.490
and artificial intelligence
is deployed across the network

00:01:32.514 --> 00:01:34.247
to optimize travel routes.

00:01:34.927 --> 00:01:36.688
New solutions have been invented.

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.514
China's largest taxi-hailing platform,
called Didi Chuxing,

00:01:41.538 --> 00:01:43.403
launched a new service called Hitch,

00:01:43.427 --> 00:01:46.244
which matches car owners
who are driving home

00:01:46.268 --> 00:01:49.109
with passengers looking
for long-distance routes.

00:01:49.632 --> 00:01:50.798
In just its third year,

00:01:50.822 --> 00:01:54.227
Hitch served 30 million trips
in this past holiday season,

00:01:54.251 --> 00:01:57.465
the longest of which
was further than 1,500 miles.

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:00.275
That's about the distance
from Miami to Boston.

00:02:01.368 --> 00:02:06.299
This enormous need of migrant workers
has powered fast upgrade and innovation

00:02:06.323 --> 00:02:08.539
across the country's transport systems.

00:02:09.673 --> 00:02:14.172
Now, the Chinese internet has developed
in both familiar and unfamiliar ways.

00:02:14.593 --> 00:02:16.006
Just like in Silicon Valley,

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.331
some of the seismic shifts
in technology and consumer behavior

00:02:19.355 --> 00:02:21.982
have been driven by academic research,

00:02:22.006 --> 00:02:23.912
have been driven by enterprise desires,

00:02:23.936 --> 00:02:27.647
with the whims of privilege and youth
sprinkled in every once in a while.

00:02:28.038 --> 00:02:30.847
I am a product
of the American tech industry,

00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:33.061
both as a consumer and a corporate leader.

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:35.685
So I am well acquainted
with this type of fuel.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.321
But about a year and a half ago,

00:02:38.345 --> 00:02:40.734
I moved from my home
in New York City to Hong Kong

00:02:40.758 --> 00:02:43.654
to become the CEO
of the South China Morning Post.

00:02:43.678 --> 00:02:46.609
And from this new vantage point,

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:49.704
I've observed something
that is far less familiar to me,

00:02:49.728 --> 00:02:54.516
propelling so much of China's innovation
and many of its entrepreneurs.

00:02:55.355 --> 00:02:57.960
It is an overwhelming need economy

00:02:57.984 --> 00:03:00.720
that is serving
an underprivileged populous,

00:03:00.744 --> 00:03:04.238
which has been separated for 30 years
from China's economic boom.

00:03:05.425 --> 00:03:09.490
The stark gaps that exist
between the rich and the poor,

00:03:09.514 --> 00:03:10.849
between urban and rural

00:03:10.873 --> 00:03:13.620
or the academic and the unschooled --

00:03:13.644 --> 00:03:16.152
these gaps, they form a soil

00:03:16.176 --> 00:03:19.791
that's ready for some
incredible empowerment.

00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:23.514
So when capital and investment
become focused on the needs of people

00:03:23.538 --> 00:03:27.276
who are hanging to the bottom rungs
of an economic ladder,

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.639
that's when we start to see the internet
truly become a job creator,

00:03:32.663 --> 00:03:34.122
an education enabler

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:36.703
and in many other ways, a path forward.

00:03:37.806 --> 00:03:41.362
Of course, China is not the only place
where this alternative fuel exists,

00:03:41.386 --> 00:03:43.658
nor the only place where it is possible.

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.654
But because of the country's sheer scale
and status as a rising superpower,

00:03:48.678 --> 00:03:51.701
the needs of its population
have created an opportunity

00:03:51.725 --> 00:03:54.153
for truly compelling impact.

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:58.644
When explaining the rapid growth
of the Chinese tech industry,

00:03:58.668 --> 00:04:00.834
many observers will cite two reasons.

00:04:01.286 --> 00:04:04.691
The first is the 1.4 billion people
that call China home.

00:04:05.442 --> 00:04:08.958
The second is the government's
active participation --

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:12.156
or pervasive intervention,
depending on how you view it.

00:04:12.732 --> 00:04:16.213
Now, the central authorities have spent
heavily on network infrastructure

00:04:16.237 --> 00:04:17.411
over the years,

00:04:17.435 --> 00:04:19.839
creating an attractive
environment for investment.

00:04:19.863 --> 00:04:23.125
At the same time, they've insisted
on standards and regulation,

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:26.585
which has led to fast consensus
and therefore, fast adoption.

00:04:27.284 --> 00:04:30.252
The world's largest pool
of tech talent exists

00:04:30.276 --> 00:04:33.060
because of the abundance
of educational incentives.

00:04:33.415 --> 00:04:37.775
And local, domestic companies,
in the past, have been protected

00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:39.272
from international competition

00:04:39.296 --> 00:04:40.709
by market controls.

00:04:41.641 --> 00:04:44.029
Of course, you cannot observe
the Chinese internet

00:04:44.053 --> 00:04:46.196
without finding widespread censorship

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.474
and very serious concerns
about dystopian monitoring.

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:51.363
As an example:

00:04:51.387 --> 00:04:54.387
China is in the process of rolling out
a social credit rating

00:04:54.411 --> 00:04:56.871
that will cover its entire population,

00:04:56.895 --> 00:04:59.474
rewarding and restricting citizens,

00:04:59.498 --> 00:05:01.641
based on highly
qualitative characteristics

00:05:01.665 --> 00:05:03.465
like honesty and integrity.

00:05:04.442 --> 00:05:06.410
At the same time,

00:05:06.434 --> 00:05:08.284
China is deploying facial recognition

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:12.546
across many of its 170 million
closed-circuit cameras.

00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:17.911
Artificial intelligence is being used
to predict crime and terrorism

00:05:17.935 --> 00:05:19.125
in Xinjiang province,

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:23.285
where the Muslim minority
is already under constant surveillance.

00:05:24.353 --> 00:05:28.496
Yet, the internet has continued
to grow, and it is so big --

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.992
much bigger than I think
most of us realize.

00:05:31.445 --> 00:05:33.146
By the end of 2017,

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.617
the Chinese internet population
had reached 772 million users.

00:05:37.641 --> 00:05:40.656
That's larger than the populations
of the United States, Russia,

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.799
of Germany, of the United Kingdom,
of France and Canada combined.

00:05:44.704 --> 00:05:47.069
Ninety-eight percent of them
are active on mobile.

00:05:47.093 --> 00:05:49.449
Ninety-two percent of them
use messaging apps.

00:05:49.823 --> 00:05:53.236
There are now 650 million
digital news consumers,

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.537
580 million digital video consumers,

00:05:56.561 --> 00:05:59.633
and the country's largest
e-commerce platform, Taobao,

00:05:59.657 --> 00:06:03.015
now boasts 580 million
monthly active users.

00:06:03.473 --> 00:06:05.676
It's about 80 percent larger than Amazon.

00:06:06.492 --> 00:06:09.936
On-demand travel, between bikes and cars,

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.039
now accounts for 10 billion
trips a year in China.

00:06:13.357 --> 00:06:16.653
That's two-thirds of all trips
taken around the world.

00:06:17.875 --> 00:06:19.692
So it's a very mixed bag.

00:06:20.233 --> 00:06:25.514
The internet exists in a restricted,
arguably manipulated form within China,

00:06:25.538 --> 00:06:29.840
yet it is massive and has vastly improved
the lives of its citizens.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.379
So even in its imperfection,

00:06:32.403 --> 00:06:35.426
the growth of the Chinese internet
should not be dismissed,

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.942
and it's worthy of our closer examination.

00:06:39.005 --> 00:06:40.970
Let me tell you two other stories today.

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:45.791
Luo Zhaoliu is a 34-year-old engineer
from Jiangxi province.

00:06:45.815 --> 00:06:49.324
Now, his home region used to be
extremely important to the Communist party

00:06:49.348 --> 00:06:51.706
because this was the birthplace
of the Red Army.

00:06:52.046 --> 00:06:54.296
But over the decades,
because of its separation

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.197
from the economic and manufacturing
centers of the country,

00:06:57.221 --> 00:06:59.310
it has slid into irrelevance.

00:06:59.934 --> 00:07:03.093
Luo, like so many in his generation,
left home at a young age

00:07:03.117 --> 00:07:05.117
to look for work in a major city.

00:07:05.141 --> 00:07:08.077
He ended up in Shenzhen,
which is one of China's tech hubs.

00:07:08.768 --> 00:07:10.048
As the young migrate,

00:07:10.072 --> 00:07:13.204
these rural villages
are left with only elderly,

00:07:13.228 --> 00:07:16.619
who are really struggling to elevate
themselves above abject poverty.

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:22.395
After nine years, Luo decided
to return to Jiangxi in 2017,

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:25.768
because he believed that the booming
e-commerce marketplace in China

00:07:25.792 --> 00:07:28.054
could help him revive his village.

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:30.610
Like many rural communities,

00:07:30.634 --> 00:07:34.274
Luo's home specialized in
a very specific provincial craft --

00:07:34.847 --> 00:07:37.161
making fermented bean curd, in this case.

00:07:37.736 --> 00:07:40.291
So he started a small factory

00:07:40.315 --> 00:07:43.138
and started selling
his locally made goods online.

00:07:43.601 --> 00:07:45.880
There have been many years
of consumption growth

00:07:45.904 --> 00:07:47.247
across China's major cities.

00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:51.233
But recently, technology has been driving
an explosion in craft goods sales

00:07:51.257 --> 00:07:53.606
among China's middle and upper classes.

00:07:53.907 --> 00:07:57.024
WeChat and other e-commerce
platforms allow rural producers

00:07:57.048 --> 00:07:58.895
to market and sell their goods

00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:01.762
far beyond their original
distribution areas.

00:08:02.886 --> 00:08:05.014
Research companies
actually track this impact

00:08:05.038 --> 00:08:07.625
by counting what is called
"Taobao villages."

00:08:07.649 --> 00:08:11.355
This is any rural village where at least
10 percent of its households

00:08:11.379 --> 00:08:14.701
are selling goods online
and making a certain amount of revenue.

00:08:14.725 --> 00:08:18.067
And the growth has been significant
in the last few years.

00:08:18.091 --> 00:08:21.024
There were just 20
Taobao villages in 2013,

00:08:21.448 --> 00:08:23.186
212 in 2014,

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.790
780 in 2015,

00:08:25.814 --> 00:08:27.234
1,300 in 2016

00:08:27.258 --> 00:08:29.879
and over 2,100 at the end of 2017.

00:08:30.419 --> 00:08:34.039
They now account for nearly
half a million active online stores,

00:08:34.063 --> 00:08:37.198
19 billion dollars in annual sales

00:08:37.222 --> 00:08:39.561
and 1.3 million new jobs created.

00:08:41.047 --> 00:08:44.852
In Luo's first year back home,
he was able to employ 15 villagers.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.721
And he sold about 60,000 units
of fermented bean curd.

00:08:49.296 --> 00:08:52.097
He expects to hire 30 more people
in the next year,

00:08:52.121 --> 00:08:53.988
as his demand rapidly rises.

00:08:55.927 --> 00:09:00.830
There are 60 million left-behind children
scattered across China's rural landscape.

00:09:01.402 --> 00:09:04.299
And they grow up with at least one parent
far away from home,

00:09:04.323 --> 00:09:05.657
as a migrant worker.

00:09:06.307 --> 00:09:09.236
Alongside all the general
hardships of rural life,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.279
they often have to travel
vast and dangerous distances

00:09:12.303 --> 00:09:13.831
just to get to school.

00:09:13.855 --> 00:09:15.267
They account for 30 percent

00:09:15.291 --> 00:09:18.212
of the country's primary
and high school students.

00:09:18.839 --> 00:09:22.013
Ten-year-old Chang Wenxuan
is one of these students.

00:09:22.522 --> 00:09:26.101
He walks an hour each way
every single day to school,

00:09:26.125 --> 00:09:29.771
across these deep ravines,
in an isolated landscape.

00:09:30.847 --> 00:09:34.236
But when he arrives at the small
farming village in Gansu province,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.254
he will find just two other students
in this entire school.

00:09:38.585 --> 00:09:41.762
Now, Chang's school is one
of 1,000 in Gansu alone

00:09:41.786 --> 00:09:44.328
that has less than five
registered students.

00:09:44.823 --> 00:09:47.188
So with limited student interaction,

00:09:47.212 --> 00:09:48.881
with underqualified teachers

00:09:48.905 --> 00:09:52.127
and schoolhouses that are
barely furnished and not insulated,

00:09:52.151 --> 00:09:54.850
rural students have
long been disadvantaged,

00:09:54.874 --> 00:09:57.138
with almost no path to higher education.

00:09:58.331 --> 00:10:01.474
But Chang's future has been
dramatically shifted

00:10:01.498 --> 00:10:03.887
with the installation
of a “Sunshine Classroom.”

00:10:04.927 --> 00:10:07.616
He's now part of a digital
classroom of 100 students

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.887
across 28 different schools,

00:10:09.911 --> 00:10:11.934
taught by qualified and certified teachers

00:10:11.958 --> 00:10:14.466
live-streaming from
hundreds of miles away.

00:10:14.998 --> 00:10:17.464
He has access to new subjects
like music and art,

00:10:17.488 --> 00:10:18.639
to new friends

00:10:18.663 --> 00:10:21.473
and to experiences that extend
far beyond his home.

00:10:22.252 --> 00:10:25.382
Recently, Chang even got to visit
the Frederiksborg Castle museum

00:10:25.406 --> 00:10:26.578
in Denmark --

00:10:26.602 --> 00:10:27.777
virtually, of course.

00:10:28.831 --> 00:10:32.498
Now, online education has existed
for many years outside of China.

00:10:32.919 --> 00:10:36.188
But it has never reached
truly transformative scale,

00:10:36.212 --> 00:10:38.526
likely because traditional
education systems

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.206
in other tech centers of the world

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.124
are far more advanced and far more stable.

00:10:44.053 --> 00:10:46.585
But China's extreme terrain and size

00:10:46.609 --> 00:10:49.921
have created an enormous and immediate
need for innovation.

00:10:50.863 --> 00:10:54.032
There's a tech start-up in Shenzhen
that grew to 300,000 students

00:10:54.056 --> 00:10:55.283
in just one year.

00:10:55.307 --> 00:10:57.426
And by our best estimation at the Post,

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:01.101
there are now 55 million
rural students across China

00:11:01.125 --> 00:11:04.199
that are addressable and accessible
by live-streaming classes.

00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:08.546
This market of need is larger
than the entire US student population

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:11.044
between kindergarten and grade 12.

00:11:12.831 --> 00:11:15.180
So I'm extremely encouraged to find out

00:11:15.204 --> 00:11:18.109
that private investment
in ed-tech in China

00:11:18.133 --> 00:11:20.029
now exceeds one billion dollars a year,

00:11:20.053 --> 00:11:22.903
with another 30 billion dollars
in public funding

00:11:22.927 --> 00:11:25.527
that is committed between now and 2020.

00:11:27.585 --> 00:11:29.950
As the Chinese internet continues to grow,

00:11:29.974 --> 00:11:33.522
even in its imperfection
and restrictions and controls,

00:11:33.546 --> 00:11:35.799
the lives of its
once-forgotten populations

00:11:35.823 --> 00:11:37.670
have been irrevocably elevated.

00:11:38.997 --> 00:11:42.236
There is a focus on
populations of need, not of want,

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.799
that has driven a lot
of the curiosity, the creativity

00:11:44.823 --> 00:11:46.582
and the development that we see.

00:11:47.157 --> 00:11:49.223
And there's still more to come.

00:11:49.823 --> 00:11:52.284
In America, internet
population, or penetration,

00:11:52.308 --> 00:11:53.803
has now reached 88 percent.

00:11:54.395 --> 00:11:58.625
In China, the internet has still
only reached 56 percent of the populous.

00:11:58.649 --> 00:12:01.204
That means there are
over 600 million people

00:12:01.228 --> 00:12:03.353
who are still offline and disconnected.

00:12:04.038 --> 00:12:06.138
That's nearly twice the US population.

00:12:06.776 --> 00:12:08.501
An enormous opportunity.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:12.741
Wherever this alternative fuel exists,

00:12:12.765 --> 00:12:16.979
be it in China or Africa,
Southeast Asia or the American heartland,

00:12:17.003 --> 00:12:20.839
we should endeavor to follow it
with capital and with effort,

00:12:20.863 --> 00:12:24.546
driving both economic
and societal impact all over the world.

00:12:25.176 --> 00:12:28.656
Just imagine for a minute
what more could be possible

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.566
if the global needs of the underserved
become the primary focus

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:33.998
of our inventions.

00:12:34.481 --> 00:12:35.640
Thank you.

00:12:35.664 --> 00:12:39.782
(Applause)
