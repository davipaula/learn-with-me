00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.176
Imagine a microscopic-sized ladder
contained in the part of our brain

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.029
that we'll label our subconscious.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.822
The Ladder of Inference,

00:00:21.846 --> 00:00:25.576
which was first proposed
by Harvard professor Chris Argyris,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.440
is the basis of this model.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.136
Every time we interact with someone,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.896
that experience
enters the ladder at the bottom.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.256
That same experience zips up
the ladder in the blink of an eye,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.640
exiting at the top.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.376
This process happens
thousands of times a day

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.640
without us knowing it.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.240
Let's focus on what happens
on each rung of the ladder.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.456
On the first rung, we have the raw data
and observations of our experience.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.456
This is very similar to what someone
watching a video recording

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.160
of our experience would see.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.936
Moving up to the second rung,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.936
we filter in specific information
and details from our experience.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.256
We unknowingly filter
based on our preferences, tendencies,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.145
and many other aspects
that we believe are important.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.536
On to the third rung.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.616
We assign meaning to the information
we have filtered through.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.057
This is where we start to interpret
what our information is telling us.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.160
On our fourth rung,
a very crucial thing happens.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.856
We develop assumptions

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.936
based on the meaning
we created on the previous rung,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.200
and we start to blur the distinction
between what is fact and what is story.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.896
On the fifth rung,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.640
we develop conclusions
based on our assumptions.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.480
This is also where
our emotional reactions are created.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.576
On the sixth rung,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.496
we adjust our beliefs
about the world around us,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.416
including the person or people involved

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.456
in our experience of the moment.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.096
On the seventh and final rung,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.977
we take action
based on our adjusted beliefs.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.136
Still with me? Great!

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.936
Let's take a real-life example

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.840
and run it up the ladder
to see how this all works.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.837
Have you ever been cut off
in a parking lot, signal light on

00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:05.976
as you steer toward your coveted spot,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.735
only to slam on your brakes
at the last minute

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.056
as someone pulls in front of you
and steals your spot away?

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.869
Imagine that experience
and notice all of the data

00:02:14.893 --> 00:02:18.176
and observations landing
on the first rung of your ladder.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.280
Now let's watch what we pay attention to
on the second rung.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.856
Who cares that it's sunny out
and the birds are chirping?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.384
The 50% off sign outside
of your favorite store is meaningless.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.176
You filter in the sensation
of your grip tightening on the wheel,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.256
you feel your blood pressure rise,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.216
you hear the squeal of your brakes,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.303
and you notice the expression
on the face of the other driver

00:02:39.327 --> 00:02:41.816
as he pulls in front of you
and quickly looks away.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.016
Time for our third rung.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.279
Ever since you were young,

00:02:45.303 --> 00:02:48.016
your parents taught you
the importance of waiting in line

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.336
and taking your turn.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.594
You live and die by the rule
of first come, first served.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.376
And now this guy
has just stolen your spot.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.563
What gives?

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.016
Up to the fourth rung we go.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.136
Watch closely as our assumptions take over

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.160
and our story creates itself.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.640
"That stupid jerk, didn't his parents
teach him anything?

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.056
How could he not see my signal light?

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.600
He must never pay attention!

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.776
Why does he think he's more important
than anyone else?"

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.616
Jumping quickly to the fifth rung,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.176
we conclude that this guy
is heartless, inconsiderate,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.976
he needs to be taught a lesson
and put in his place.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.920
We feel angry, frustrated,
vindictive, justified.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.828
On our sixth rung,

00:03:28.852 --> 00:03:31.616
we adjust our beliefs
based on the experience.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.056
"That's the last time I give in!

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.576
Next time someone tries to cut me off,

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.416
tires will be smoking on the pavement

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.560
as I squeal past them into my spot."

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.816
And finally our last rung: we take action.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.776
We back up, pull up behind his car,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.696
honk our horn, and roll down our window

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.875
to scream a few choice words as well.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.056
Now imagine,

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.560
he walks over quickly, apologizing.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.296
His wife, who's almost due
with their first baby,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.896
called him from inside the mall
to say she is in labor

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.440
and needs to get
to the hospital immediately.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.816
We're momentarily shocked,
apologize profusely,

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.880
and wish him luck
as he rushes toward the entrance.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.256
What just happened here?

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.640
What changed? Why is this so significant?

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.536
In our parking lot example,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.920
our beliefs were short-circuited
by the ladder of the other individual.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.296
"My wife is in labor,
I need to get there quick,

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.296
there's a parking spot. Whew!

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.136
Oh, jeez, I cut someone off.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.296
I'd better apologize quickly
so they don't think I'm a jerk."

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.656
But what if we were able
to short-circuit our ladders ourselves?

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.680
Proactively, by choice?

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.080
Guess what? We can!

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.000
Let's return to our unique
human function of free will.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.576
Next time you notice yourself
reacting to your experience,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.680
pay focused attention to your ladder.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.936
Ask yourself what beliefs are at play,

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.375
where do they come from?

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.936
What data and observations
did you filter in

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.016
as a result of your beliefs,

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.376
and why?

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.160
Are your assumptions valid
and supported by facts?

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.056
Would a different set of assumptions
create different feelings,

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.520
and result in new and better
conclusions and actions?

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.176
We all have our own unique ladder.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.576
Be mindful of yours,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.560
and help others to see theirs.
