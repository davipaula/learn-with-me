00:00:14.858 --> 00:00:17.071
(Music: "Wade in the Water"
by Ella Jenkins)

00:00:17.095 --> 00:00:20.579
Wade in the water

00:00:20.603 --> 00:00:24.157
Wade in the water, children

00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:27.210
Wade in the water

00:00:27.657 --> 00:00:30.270
God's a-gonna trouble the water

00:00:30.294 --> 00:00:34.283
Oh, why don't you wade in the water

00:00:34.712 --> 00:00:38.183
Wade in the water, children

00:00:38.207 --> 00:00:41.005
Wade in the water

00:00:41.728 --> 00:00:44.714
God's a-gonna trouble the water

00:00:45.394 --> 00:00:48.697
See that man all dressed in white

00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:51.800
God's a-gonna trouble the water

00:00:51.824 --> 00:00:55.783
He looks like a man of the Israelite

00:00:55.807 --> 00:00:59.092
God's a-gonna trouble the water

00:00:59.116 --> 00:01:02.416
Wade in the water

00:01:02.822 --> 00:01:06.311
Wade in the water, children

00:01:06.335 --> 00:01:09.171
Wade in the water

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.740
God's a-gonna trouble the water

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.988
See that man all dressed in red

00:01:17.012 --> 00:01:19.983
God's a-gonna trouble the water

00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:23.950
It looks like the man that Moses led

00:01:23.974 --> 00:01:26.948
God's a-gonna trouble the water

00:01:27.434 --> 00:01:30.464
Wade in the water

00:01:30.927 --> 00:01:34.189
Wade in the water, children

00:01:34.213 --> 00:01:37.286
Wade in the water

00:01:37.947 --> 00:01:40.986
God's a-gonna trouble the water

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.492
Didn't my Lord deliver Daniel

00:01:44.982 --> 00:01:47.879
Daniel, Daniel

00:01:47.903 --> 00:01:51.915
Didn't my Lord deliver Daniel

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.177
Then why not every man?

00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:59.122
Didn't my Lord deliver Daniel

00:01:59.146 --> 00:02:02.178
Daniel, Daniel

00:02:02.202 --> 00:02:05.480
Didn't my Lord deliver Daniel

00:02:06.162 --> 00:02:08.687
Why not every man?

00:02:09.665 --> 00:02:12.461
Man went down to the river

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:16.112
Man went down to the river

00:02:16.696 --> 00:02:19.250
Man went down to the river

00:02:20.157 --> 00:02:22.613
Went down there for to pray

00:02:23.705 --> 00:02:26.602
Man went down to the river

00:02:27.237 --> 00:02:29.694
Man went down to the river

00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:34.128
Man went down to the river

00:02:34.152 --> 00:02:36.965
To wash his sins away

00:02:37.723 --> 00:02:41.236
He washed all day, he washed all night

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.650
He washed till his hands were sore

00:02:44.506 --> 00:02:48.202
He washed all day, he washed all night

00:02:48.226 --> 00:02:51.188
Till he couldn't wash a-no more

00:02:52.194 --> 00:02:55.726
Man went down to the river

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.396
Man went down to the river

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.910
Man went down to the river

00:03:01.934 --> 00:03:04.378
(Music fades)

00:03:05.546 --> 00:03:11.615
(Applause)

00:03:19.188 --> 00:03:21.668
(Juliet Blake) And now,
let's give a warm welcome

00:03:21.692 --> 00:03:27.568
to the artistic director emerita
of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater,

00:03:27.592 --> 00:03:29.028
Judith Jamison.

00:03:29.362 --> 00:03:36.084
(Applause)

00:03:36.108 --> 00:03:37.441
Judith Jamison: Thanks.

00:03:38.225 --> 00:03:39.375
How are y'all?

00:03:39.757 --> 00:03:40.963
(Audience cheers)

00:03:40.987 --> 00:03:43.146
JJ: Yeah, you know
you've just been to church?

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.171
(Laughter)

00:03:44.195 --> 00:03:47.113
You just saw a baptism, yes?

00:03:47.855 --> 00:03:52.259
This is from this wonderful piece
Mr. Ailey created in 1960,

00:03:52.283 --> 00:03:54.858
called "Revelations."

00:03:55.292 --> 00:03:59.069
Mr. Ailey was 29 years old
when he choreographed this masterpiece.

00:03:59.093 --> 00:04:02.998
It's been danced all over the world
and understood universally,

00:04:03.022 --> 00:04:06.664
because he understood
the humanity in us all.

00:04:07.085 --> 00:04:11.180
"Revelations" is a reflection
of a journey we all take in life,

00:04:11.204 --> 00:04:13.593
and, hopefully, triumphantly.

00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:16.799
That was the magic of Alvin Ailey.

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:19.665
He was able to see you, in the audience,

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:21.430
see me, as the dancer,

00:04:21.454 --> 00:04:23.434
and see the connection between us,

00:04:23.458 --> 00:04:26.448
and choreographed works
that connected us all.

00:04:26.472 --> 00:04:29.615
So you felt he was telling your story,

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.327
while I felt I was dancing mine.

00:04:34.163 --> 00:04:36.356
I started dancing when I was six years old

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.561
in Philadelphia.

00:04:37.585 --> 00:04:38.735
I was skinny ...

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:42.807
(Laughter)

00:04:43.172 --> 00:04:45.434
Dark chocolate,

00:04:45.458 --> 00:04:48.156
and a kid with legs up to my armpits.

00:04:48.546 --> 00:04:52.656
And the very first performance I had,
at the Judimar School of Dance,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.109
was in a red checkered shirt,

00:04:57.133 --> 00:05:00.466
dungarees, pink ballet shoes,

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.101
and we were dancing to "I'm an Old Cowhand
from the Rio Grande."

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.990
I loved every minute of it.

00:05:08.014 --> 00:05:10.824
I mean, I literally did love
every minute of it,

00:05:10.848 --> 00:05:13.006
especially when I heard the applause,

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.954
and I knew right there,
when I was six, I said,

00:05:15.978 --> 00:05:17.144
"That's for me."

00:05:17.168 --> 00:05:18.680
(Laughter)

00:05:18.704 --> 00:05:20.007
At six, you're not thinking

00:05:20.031 --> 00:05:22.142
that's going to be
a career of your lifetime,

00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:24.458
but that was perfect for that moment.

00:05:24.482 --> 00:05:27.585
I danced my way through school,
and through college,

00:05:27.609 --> 00:05:31.006
and it still didn't dawn on me
that that's what I actually wanted to do.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.641
I went to an audition,

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:34.379
which I was dreadful in --

00:05:34.403 --> 00:05:37.418
it's the only audition
I've had in my life --

00:05:37.442 --> 00:05:39.498
and when I was let go
from that audition --

00:05:39.522 --> 00:05:42.514
because I thought when they were saying,
"Thank you very much,"

00:05:42.538 --> 00:05:43.800
that meant for me to stay.

00:05:43.824 --> 00:05:46.704
(Laughter)

00:05:46.728 --> 00:05:48.315
I ran up the steps,

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:50.656
and there was a man sitting on the steps.

00:05:51.688 --> 00:05:53.355
And I barely noticed him.

00:05:53.768 --> 00:05:55.037
He was an observer.

00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:57.022
Three days later, that man called me

00:05:57.046 --> 00:06:00.688
and asked me, would I like to join
the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.

00:06:00.712 --> 00:06:03.450
That's how it happened, folks, that's it.

00:06:03.474 --> 00:06:05.430
There's no drama or trauma.

00:06:05.454 --> 00:06:07.720
(Applause)

00:06:07.744 --> 00:06:10.458
So I spent 15 years dancing
with the company,

00:06:10.482 --> 00:06:13.400
and then I directed it
for something like 21 years.

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:17.029
If you were black
and African American and a dancer,

00:06:17.053 --> 00:06:19.379
any time between the '40s and the '70s,

00:06:19.403 --> 00:06:20.775
you had much to say,

00:06:20.799 --> 00:06:24.307
because your complete voice
was not being heard.

00:06:24.331 --> 00:06:27.783
And you were not being represented
as you truly were.

00:06:28.228 --> 00:06:30.593
Alvin Ailey had the courage,

00:06:30.617 --> 00:06:34.006
right in the middle
of the Civil Rights Movement,

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.817
to present the truth about who we were --

00:06:36.841 --> 00:06:39.150
that our creativity, our beauty,

00:06:39.174 --> 00:06:41.325
our intelligence, our talents

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:45.364
were an intrinsic part of the panoply
of American culture.

00:06:46.126 --> 00:06:52.987
Our mantra has always been
to educate, to entertain,

00:06:53.011 --> 00:06:54.701
and to lift our audiences.

00:06:54.725 --> 00:06:58.950
Mr. Ailey believed that dance
came from the people

00:06:58.974 --> 00:07:01.672
and needed to be delivered
back to the people.

00:07:01.696 --> 00:07:03.736
We didn't dance in a vacuum.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.506
It was our mission to serve people.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.540
We call it outreach now,

00:07:08.564 --> 00:07:13.046
but it's always been a part
of who we were and still are,

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.117
60 years later, to this day.

00:07:16.141 --> 00:07:19.815
Being inclusive of our audiences --

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:23.410
it's always been an important
part of the company.

00:07:23.434 --> 00:07:26.109
We ask ourselves, who are we dancing for?

00:07:26.133 --> 00:07:31.284
Why are we dancing, if not to show people
what it is to be human

00:07:31.308 --> 00:07:36.482
and to connect with the audiences
that we dance for.

00:07:37.308 --> 00:07:40.650
We've always felt responsible
to make sure the community understood

00:07:40.674 --> 00:07:43.607
that what we do
is a part of their heritage.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.831
We just don't do this, also, in America,

00:07:45.855 --> 00:07:47.204
we do it all over the world.

00:07:47.228 --> 00:07:50.116
We tour more than any other
dance company in the world.

00:07:51.855 --> 00:07:55.331
After Nelson Mandela
was released from prison,

00:07:55.355 --> 00:07:59.276
I thought, well, this is the time
to go to South Africa.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.100
And that was some outreach.

00:08:01.593 --> 00:08:04.887
We went to Johannesburg, Soweto,

00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:08.228
and some other townships
that were really in dire straits.

00:08:08.784 --> 00:08:11.340
And it dawned on me,
as we were there, I'm going like,

00:08:11.364 --> 00:08:14.180
"Here we are in the seat of Mother Africa,

00:08:14.204 --> 00:08:16.696
and we're trying to teach
these people how to dance?"

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.721
(Laughter)

00:08:17.745 --> 00:08:21.545
But it was our African Americanness
that they were interested in,

00:08:21.569 --> 00:08:25.831
and the culture that we had developed
over the last 400 years.

00:08:26.641 --> 00:08:29.276
We toured all over the world many times,

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.959
and whether we're in Europe
or South America or Asia

00:08:31.983 --> 00:08:33.164
or somewhere else,

00:08:33.188 --> 00:08:35.791
audiences are thrilled and excited.

00:08:35.815 --> 00:08:38.323
You sounded thrilled and excited.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.061
Sometimes with tears in their eyes,

00:08:41.085 --> 00:08:45.544
because this nonverbal
communication really works.

00:08:46.251 --> 00:08:50.025
And it's about embracing everyone.

00:08:50.554 --> 00:08:53.642
Alvin didn't need to explain to us

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:56.784
what was going on at the time
in the '60s and the '70s;

00:08:56.808 --> 00:09:00.514
it was obvious why were doing his work.

00:09:00.856 --> 00:09:03.722
He knew what the truth
of the time was about,

00:09:03.746 --> 00:09:07.626
and he was unafraid
to reveal it through dance.

00:09:08.079 --> 00:09:12.101
He tapped into every emotion
he had and we had,

00:09:12.125 --> 00:09:15.188
and from angerness to happiness,

00:09:15.212 --> 00:09:17.783
to grief and everything in between,

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.347
he knew us.

00:09:19.715 --> 00:09:22.691
He took our history
and turned it into powerful dance.

00:09:22.715 --> 00:09:25.902
He and I overlapped generationally.

00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:28.958
We didn't have to talk
about things so much,

00:09:28.982 --> 00:09:33.458
because we understood implicitly
our shared responsibilities.

00:09:33.482 --> 00:09:35.553
So when he asked me
to take over the company

00:09:35.577 --> 00:09:38.056
before he passed in 1989,

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.834
I felt prepared to carry it forward.

00:09:41.295 --> 00:09:44.413
Alvin and I were like parts
of the same tree.

00:09:44.437 --> 00:09:46.730
He, the roots and the trunk,

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.450
and we were the branches.

00:09:49.474 --> 00:09:51.180
I was his muse.

00:09:51.609 --> 00:09:54.069
We were all his muses.

00:09:57.081 --> 00:09:59.596
The ballet "Cry,"

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.890
which some of you might have seen --

00:10:02.914 --> 00:10:04.882
you're going to see an excerpt of it --

00:10:04.906 --> 00:10:06.196
it was made on me,

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.641
and Alvin dedicated it to all black women,

00:10:08.665 --> 00:10:10.450
especially our mothers.

00:10:11.276 --> 00:10:13.257
When Alvin and I went in the studio,

00:10:13.281 --> 00:10:14.680
of course he wasn't thinking,

00:10:14.704 --> 00:10:16.577
"Here I am, creating an iconic work."

00:10:16.601 --> 00:10:18.950
Do you know any artist that does that?

00:10:18.974 --> 00:10:21.924
You don't go into the studio

00:10:21.948 --> 00:10:24.435
to create anything

00:10:24.459 --> 00:10:28.307
but what's coming truthfully
from your heart and your spirit.

00:10:28.331 --> 00:10:31.521
And you trust that you have a dancer
you can share that with.

00:10:32.093 --> 00:10:35.117
Rehearsal space is a sacred space,

00:10:35.141 --> 00:10:36.656
not to be intruded upon,

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.144
because it's about talking
to each other through spirit.

00:10:40.601 --> 00:10:42.712
You better have some
technique on top of that

00:10:42.736 --> 00:10:44.013
so you can do the dance.

00:10:44.037 --> 00:10:45.077
(Laughter)

00:10:45.101 --> 00:10:48.901
He brought his Alvin to "Cry"
and I brought my Judy to it.

00:10:49.323 --> 00:10:51.156
I just did the steps.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.871
And this was a birthday
present for his mother,

00:10:53.895 --> 00:10:57.061
because he couldn't afford
to get her a tactile gift.

00:10:57.085 --> 00:10:58.762
When I performed it the first time,

00:10:58.786 --> 00:11:00.823
it was physically
and emotionally draining.

00:11:00.847 --> 00:11:05.061
I hadn't yet run through the whole piece
from beginning to end.

00:11:05.085 --> 00:11:08.037
The ballet is 16 minutes long.

00:11:09.518 --> 00:11:13.811
It's about a proud woman
who has been to hell and back,

00:11:13.835 --> 00:11:16.235
from her journey across the Atlantic.

00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:19.514
She's exhausted,

00:11:19.538 --> 00:11:20.815
she's a queen,

00:11:20.839 --> 00:11:24.579
and in this section,
you're going to see she is triumphant.

00:11:24.942 --> 00:11:26.434
She made it,

00:11:26.458 --> 00:11:31.744
and she is, in that last
step that she does,

00:11:31.768 --> 00:11:35.228
beating away anything negative

00:11:35.252 --> 00:11:37.355
with her tremendous strength.

00:11:38.688 --> 00:11:43.145
And in the last step,
she digs into the earth

00:11:44.482 --> 00:11:46.926
and she reaches into the sky ...

00:11:48.763 --> 00:11:52.170
because she's clearing space
for the next journey.

00:11:54.419 --> 00:11:57.586
I performed it in 1971,

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.659
and we are still clearing space.

00:12:02.808 --> 00:12:04.847
Now let me leave you
with one last thought.

00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:06.831
Here we are, in the 21st century,

00:12:06.855 --> 00:12:10.260
still fighting for civil rights.

00:12:10.284 --> 00:12:12.061
Not a day goes by

00:12:12.085 --> 00:12:16.521
that we are not made aware
of the struggle that continues.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:23.497
I believe that dance
can elevate our human experience

00:12:23.521 --> 00:12:25.418
beyond words.

00:12:25.442 --> 00:12:28.664
And when you're sitting in the dark,

00:12:28.688 --> 00:12:30.710
in the theater,

00:12:30.734 --> 00:12:34.601
having a personal experience,

00:12:34.625 --> 00:12:38.510
you don't feel blocked or misunderstood.

00:12:39.157 --> 00:12:41.069
You feel open,

00:12:42.125 --> 00:12:43.669
alive,

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:45.497
and, we hope,

00:12:46.419 --> 00:12:47.805
inspired.

00:12:48.323 --> 00:12:49.473
Thank you.

00:12:50.028 --> 00:12:56.728
(Applause)

00:12:56.742 --> 00:13:00.043
(Music: "Right on. Be free."
by East Harlem)

00:13:11.994 --> 00:13:14.940
I wanna go where the north wind blows

00:13:19.314 --> 00:13:22.938
I wanna know what the falcon knows

00:13:27.615 --> 00:13:30.772
I wanna go where the wild goose goes

00:13:34.972 --> 00:13:40.233
High flyin' bird, high flyin' bird, fly on

00:13:48.871 --> 00:13:52.016
I want the clouds over my head

00:13:55.682 --> 00:13:59.748
I don't want no store bought bed

00:14:03.914 --> 00:14:07.749
I'm gonna live until I'm dead

00:14:11.714 --> 00:14:17.199
Mother, mother, mother
Save your child

00:14:20.374 --> 00:14:23.839
Right on, be free

00:14:24.571 --> 00:14:28.133
Right on, be free

00:14:28.895 --> 00:14:32.150
Right on, be free

00:14:32.761 --> 00:14:34.894
I don't want no store bought bed

00:14:35.213 --> 00:14:36.618
Right on

00:14:36.642 --> 00:14:39.459
I want the clouds over my head

00:14:39.483 --> 00:14:40.634
Be free

00:14:40.658 --> 00:14:42.848
Ain't no time to be afraid

00:14:44.791 --> 00:14:50.216
Mother, mother, mother
Save your child

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:56.058
(Music)

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:21.556
I don't want no store bought bed

00:15:21.934 --> 00:15:23.379
Right on

00:15:23.403 --> 00:15:26.078
I want the clouds over my head

00:15:26.102 --> 00:15:27.283
Be free

00:15:27.307 --> 00:15:29.257
Ain't no time to be afraid

00:15:31.474 --> 00:15:34.258
Mother save your child

00:15:35.721 --> 00:15:38.692
I wanna see a rainbow in the sky

00:15:42.491 --> 00:15:46.395
I wanna watch the clouds go by

00:15:50.822 --> 00:15:55.702
It might make my load a little light

00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:02.705
Lord, Lord, Lord
Where will I be tomorrow night?

00:16:06.744 --> 00:16:09.262
Right on

00:16:09.286 --> 00:16:10.596
Be free

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.127
Right on, be free

00:16:15.638 --> 00:16:19.122
Right on, be free

00:16:19.146 --> 00:16:22.853
Right on, be free

00:16:22.877 --> 00:16:26.511
Right on, be free

00:16:26.887 --> 00:16:30.273
Right on, be free

00:16:31.109 --> 00:16:34.182
Right on, be free

00:16:34.918 --> 00:16:37.393
(Music fades)

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:42.557
(Applause)

00:16:42.581 --> 00:16:47.037
(Cheers)

00:16:47.061 --> 00:16:53.436
(Applause)

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.365
(Cheers)

00:16:57.389 --> 00:17:02.833
(Applause)
