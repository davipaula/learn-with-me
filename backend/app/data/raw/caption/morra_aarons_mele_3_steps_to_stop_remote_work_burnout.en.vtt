00:00:00.111 --> 00:00:03.270
You might think that working remotely
is an introvert's dream:

00:00:03.294 --> 00:00:06.494
you're in your own home
hidden behind a computer,

00:00:06.518 --> 00:00:08.203
possibly in your pajamas.

00:00:08.227 --> 00:00:09.396
But the truth is,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.365
for many introverts,
remote work is kind of a nightmare.

00:00:13.738 --> 00:00:15.210

[Made possible

00:00:17.675 --> 00:00:21.420
Now that the pandemic
has chased many of us out of our offices,

00:00:21.444 --> 00:00:24.194
we're chafing under the new
remote rules of work:

00:00:24.218 --> 00:00:25.615
too much screen time;

00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:28.702
a lack of boundaries
between work and home;

00:00:28.726 --> 00:00:30.146
endless video calls.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.414
The same things that make remote work
difficult for introverts

00:00:33.438 --> 00:00:35.327
make it difficult for everyone.

00:00:35.351 --> 00:00:38.847
Far and away, the worst part
of remote work is video calls.

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:41.486
Being on camera is a performance.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.733
Thoughtless scheduling can mean
you're basically onstage performing

00:00:45.757 --> 00:00:47.247
for eight hours a day.

00:00:47.271 --> 00:00:50.628
There are none of the nuanced cues
that help you read a room.

00:00:50.652 --> 00:00:53.815
Staring at disembodied heads on a screen

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.136
offers only a pale imitation
of real human connection.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.658
Social anxiety only makes this worse.

00:01:00.682 --> 00:01:03.539
When you have a camera in your face,

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:06.370
that can really trigger
your social anxiety.

00:01:06.394 --> 00:01:08.410
It takes energy to be on.

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:13.031
So the key to managing remote work
is to protect your energy.

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:16.099
First, pay attention
to ritual and routine.

00:01:16.123 --> 00:01:17.926
As much as we hated our commutes,

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.291
they were a ritual that created
a boundary between work and home.

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:22.479
And we need that.

00:01:22.503 --> 00:01:26.251
For many of us, those little breaks
that we would build in to the work day --

00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:29.541
going to get a cup of coffee
or a chat with a coworker --

00:01:29.565 --> 00:01:30.729
those are gone, too.

00:01:30.753 --> 00:01:34.368
For me, those rituals are when
I gather my energy,

00:01:34.392 --> 00:01:35.918
assume my work character

00:01:35.942 --> 00:01:37.720
and get into the right headspace

00:01:37.744 --> 00:01:38.916
to dive in.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.991
So how can you recreate those breaks
and boundaries at home?

00:01:42.015 --> 00:01:43.775
The key is to be intentional.

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.315
It could be music or lighting,

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:48.321
a pep talk with a friend.

00:01:48.345 --> 00:01:51.378
You could take a walk around the block
at a certain time of day

00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:53.664
or even a breathing or stretching routine

00:01:53.688 --> 00:01:54.860
before you sit --

00:01:54.884 --> 00:01:58.385
whatever it takes for you
to delineate the transition

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.123
between work and home.

00:02:00.615 --> 00:02:05.087
Second, we need to manage
our pace, place and space.

00:02:05.111 --> 00:02:08.364
You can think of pacing
as managing the interactions

00:02:08.388 --> 00:02:09.682
that tax your energy

00:02:09.706 --> 00:02:11.233
versus those that recharge you.

00:02:11.257 --> 00:02:13.956
You could schedule fewer videoconferences,

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.192
because remember, those are performances.

00:02:16.216 --> 00:02:20.462
You could schedule downtime
or recharge time after performances.

00:02:20.486 --> 00:02:21.668
Oprah does this,

00:02:21.692 --> 00:02:24.531
as do many introverted
performers and CEOs.

00:02:24.555 --> 00:02:26.602
You could consider the time of day.

00:02:26.626 --> 00:02:30.604
Think about when you can
typically summon the energy to be on

00:02:30.628 --> 00:02:33.041
and save other times for quiet work.

00:02:33.065 --> 00:02:35.749
For place, use your workspace

00:02:35.773 --> 00:02:38.358
to help you enforce good boundaries.

00:02:38.382 --> 00:02:41.354
Even if your desk is in your kitchen,

00:02:41.378 --> 00:02:43.950
make it feel like a workplace.

00:02:43.974 --> 00:02:47.989
For space, build in
some alone time every day.

00:02:48.013 --> 00:02:50.038
And this includes
time away from your kids.

00:02:50.062 --> 00:02:52.356
It's really key to avoiding burnout.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.393
Finally, if you're a manager,

00:02:54.417 --> 00:02:56.316
you have a special role to play

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.952
to help employees protect
their pace, place and space.

00:02:59.976 --> 00:03:02.313
Manage the room during video calls.

00:03:02.337 --> 00:03:05.743
Even remotely, chatty extroverts
tend to dominate.

00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:08.144
To create a space
where everyone can be heard,

00:03:08.168 --> 00:03:09.749
structure agendas,

00:03:09.773 --> 00:03:11.638
assign presentation rules

00:03:11.662 --> 00:03:14.146
and minimize brainstorming.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.835
Brainstorming can trigger social anxiety,

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.035
and it can freeze up introverts.

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:22.649
Instead, create a shared space
where people can write their ideas

00:03:22.673 --> 00:03:24.878
before a brainstorming session.

00:03:24.902 --> 00:03:27.297
Favor audio over video calls.

00:03:27.321 --> 00:03:31.638
Research shows that we actually
communicate more emotion and nuance

00:03:31.662 --> 00:03:33.102
via audio alone.

00:03:33.126 --> 00:03:35.073
Try asynchronous communication

00:03:35.097 --> 00:03:38.380
for more complicated
or provocative one-on-ones.

00:03:38.404 --> 00:03:41.120
You can steal this idea
from author Robert Glazer:

00:03:41.144 --> 00:03:45.601
record a voice memo or video on your phone
explaining your perspective

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:46.960
and send it to a colleague.

00:03:46.984 --> 00:03:50.932
And that way, they can respond
and react in their own time.

00:03:50.956 --> 00:03:53.290
Along with a lot of challenges now,

00:03:53.314 --> 00:03:54.692
we have an opportunity.

00:03:54.716 --> 00:03:56.631
Remote work is here to stay,

00:03:56.655 --> 00:04:00.379
so don't just transfer old habits
and old company culture

00:04:00.403 --> 00:04:01.618
to remote work.

00:04:01.642 --> 00:04:03.321
Build something better.

00:04:03.345 --> 00:04:04.656
To get started,

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.227
ask the introverts in your office
what their ideal day looks like

00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:09.660
and take your cue from there.
