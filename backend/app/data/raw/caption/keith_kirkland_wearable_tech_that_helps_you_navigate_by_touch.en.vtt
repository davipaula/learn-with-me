00:00:12.706 --> 00:00:14.562
Do you remember your first kiss?

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.761
Or that time you burned
the roof of your mouth

00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:18.984
on a hot slice of pizza?

00:00:19.532 --> 00:00:22.385
What about playing tag
or duck, duck, goose as a child?

00:00:22.863 --> 00:00:26.440
These are all instances where
we're using touch to understand something.

00:00:26.974 --> 00:00:28.866
And it's the basis of haptic design.

00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:32.228
"Haptic" means of or relating to
the sense of touch.

00:00:32.252 --> 00:00:34.982
And we've all been using that
our entire lives.

00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:38.284
I was working on my computer
when my friend,

00:00:38.308 --> 00:00:41.236
seeing me hunched over typing,
walked over behind me.

00:00:41.617 --> 00:00:44.513
She put her left thumb
into the left side of my lower back,

00:00:44.537 --> 00:00:48.291
while reaching her right index finger
around to the front of my right shoulder.

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:50.155
Instinctively, I sat up straight.

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.371
In one quick and gentle gesture,

00:00:52.395 --> 00:00:54.694
she had communicated
how to improve my posture.

00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:57.730
The paper I was working on
at that very moment

00:00:57.754 --> 00:01:01.166
centered around developing new ways
to teach movement using technology.

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.775
I wanted to create a suit
that could teach a person kung fu.

00:01:05.434 --> 00:01:07.236
(Laughter)

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.379
But I had no idea how
to communicate movement

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:11.401
without an instructor being in the room.

00:01:12.187 --> 00:01:15.922
And in that moment,
it became crystal clear: touch.

00:01:16.657 --> 00:01:20.156
If I had vibrating motors
where she had placed each of her fingers,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.546
paired with motion-capture data
of my current and optimal posture,

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.473
I could simulate the entire experience

00:01:26.497 --> 00:01:28.971
without an instructor
needing to be in the room.

00:01:28.995 --> 00:01:32.703
But there was still one important part
of the puzzle that was missing.

00:01:32.727 --> 00:01:35.600
If I want you to raise your wrist
two inches off of your lap,

00:01:35.624 --> 00:01:37.337
using vibration,

00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:38.885
how do I tell you to do that?

00:01:40.237 --> 00:01:43.515
Do I put a motor at the top of your wrist,
so you know to lift up?

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.634
Or do I put one
at the bottom of your wrist,

00:01:45.658 --> 00:01:47.586
so it feels like you're being pushed up?

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.522
There were no readily available answers

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:52.221
because there was no commonly
agreed-upon haptic language

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:53.791
to communicate information with.

00:01:54.188 --> 00:01:56.981
So my cofounders and I
set out to create that language.

00:01:57.987 --> 00:02:01.154
And the first device we built
was not a kung fu suit.

00:02:01.178 --> 00:02:02.384
(Laughter)

00:02:02.408 --> 00:02:04.768
But in a way, it was even more impressive

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:06.854
because of its simplicity and usefulness.

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:09.799
We started with the use case
of navigation,

00:02:09.823 --> 00:02:11.879
which is a simplified form of movement.

00:02:12.687 --> 00:02:14.346
We then created Wayband,

00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:19.390
a wrist-wearable device that could
orient a user toward a destination,

00:02:19.414 --> 00:02:21.282
using vibrating cues.

00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:23.965
We would ask people to spin around

00:02:25.054 --> 00:02:28.481
and to stop in a way that they felt
was the right way to go.

00:02:29.061 --> 00:02:31.434
Informally, we tried this
with hundreds of people,

00:02:31.458 --> 00:02:34.417
and most could figure it out
within about 15 seconds.

00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:35.908
It was that intuitive.

00:02:36.847 --> 00:02:39.929
Initially, we were just trying to get
people out of their phones

00:02:39.953 --> 00:02:41.752
and back into the real world.

00:02:41.776 --> 00:02:43.736
But the more we experimented,

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.927
the more we realized that those
who stood to benefit most from our work

00:02:47.951 --> 00:02:50.551
were people who had little or no sight.

00:02:51.387 --> 00:02:54.252
When we first approached
a blind organization, they told us,

00:02:54.276 --> 00:02:56.142
"Don't build a blind device.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.680
Build a device that everyone can use

00:02:58.704 --> 00:03:01.042
but that's optimized
for the blind experience."

00:03:01.505 --> 00:03:05.048
We created our company WearWorks
with three guiding principles:

00:03:06.792 --> 00:03:07.942
make cool stuff,

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.418
create the greatest impact we can
in our lifetimes

00:03:11.442 --> 00:03:14.501
and reimagine an entire world
designed for touch.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.343
And on November 5, 2017,

00:03:19.446 --> 00:03:22.358
Wayband helped a person who was blind

00:03:22.382 --> 00:03:25.164
run the first 15 miles
of the New York City Marathon

00:03:25.188 --> 00:03:27.141
without any sighted assistance.

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:33.745
(Applause)

00:03:35.744 --> 00:03:38.761
It didn't get him through the entire race
due to the heavy rain,

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:39.975
but that didn't matter.

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:41.006
(Laughter)

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.244
We had proved the point:

00:03:42.268 --> 00:03:45.823
that it was possible to navigate
a complex route using only touch.

00:03:45.847 --> 00:03:47.282
So, why touch?

00:03:47.903 --> 00:03:49.594
The skin has an innate sensitivity

00:03:49.618 --> 00:03:53.085
akin to the eyes' ability
to recognize millions of colors

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.363
or the ears' ability to recognize
complex pitch and tone.

00:03:56.387 --> 00:03:58.014
Yet, as a communications channel,

00:03:58.038 --> 00:04:01.672
it's been largely relegated to
Morse code-like cell phone notifications.

00:04:01.696 --> 00:04:04.768
If you were to suddenly receive
a kiss or a punch,

00:04:04.792 --> 00:04:07.775
your reaction would be
instinctive and immediate.

00:04:08.378 --> 00:04:11.373
Meanwhile, your brain would be playing
catch-up on the back end

00:04:11.397 --> 00:04:13.690
to understand the details
of what just occurred.

00:04:13.714 --> 00:04:16.889
And compared to instincts,
conscious thought is pretty slow.

00:04:17.706 --> 00:04:18.969
But it's a lightning bolt

00:04:18.993 --> 00:04:21.493
compared to the snail's pace
of language acquisition.

00:04:22.008 --> 00:04:24.371
I spent a considerable amount of time

00:04:24.395 --> 00:04:30.101
learning Spanish, Japanese,
German and currently Swedish,

00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:31.832
with varying degrees of failure.

00:04:31.856 --> 00:04:34.092
(Laughter)

00:04:35.482 --> 00:04:39.635
But within those failures were kernels
of how different languages are organized.

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:41.366
That gave our team insight

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.128
into how to use the linguistic order
of well-established languages

00:04:45.152 --> 00:04:48.514
as inspiration for
an entirely new haptic language,

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:50.271
one based purely on touch.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.519
It also showed us when using language
mechanics wasn't the best way

00:04:54.543 --> 00:04:55.932
to deliver information.

00:04:56.823 --> 00:05:00.315
In the same way a smile is a smile
across every culture,

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:02.776
what if there was some
underlying mechanism of touch

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.419
that transcended linguistic
and cultural boundaries?

00:05:06.235 --> 00:05:08.168
A universal language, of sorts.

00:05:08.646 --> 00:05:13.068
You see, I could give you
buzz-buzz-buzz, buzz-buzz,

00:05:13.092 --> 00:05:14.543
and you would eventually learn

00:05:14.567 --> 00:05:16.697
that that particular
vibration means "stop."

00:05:17.123 --> 00:05:19.974
But as haptic designers,
we challenged ourselves.

00:05:21.045 --> 00:05:23.245
What would it be like to design "stop?"

00:05:24.299 --> 00:05:25.538
Well, based on context,

00:05:25.562 --> 00:05:28.006
most of us have the experience
of being in a vehicle

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.704
and having that vehicle stop suddenly,
along with our body's reaction to it.

00:05:32.545 --> 00:05:34.274
So if I wanted you to stop,

00:05:34.298 --> 00:05:36.315
I could send you
a vibration pattern, sure.

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:39.099
Or, I could design a haptic experience

00:05:39.123 --> 00:05:42.665
that just made stopping
feel like it was the right thing to do.

00:05:43.496 --> 00:05:47.286
And that takes more than an arbitrary
assignment of haptic cues to meanings.

00:05:47.704 --> 00:05:49.304
It takes a deep empathy.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.720
It also takes the ability to distill
human experience into meaningful insights

00:05:54.744 --> 00:05:58.269
and then into haptic
gestures and products.

00:05:59.133 --> 00:06:01.894
Haptic design is going to expand
the human ability

00:06:01.918 --> 00:06:04.093
to sense and respond to our environments,

00:06:04.117 --> 00:06:05.850
both physical and virtual.

00:06:06.292 --> 00:06:08.806
There's a new frontier: touch.

00:06:09.545 --> 00:06:12.928
And it has the power to change
how we all see the world around us.

00:06:13.325 --> 00:06:14.507
Thank you.

00:06:14.531 --> 00:06:19.832
(Applause)
