00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.389
A few years ago,

00:00:14.413 --> 00:00:16.190
an American defense consultant I know

00:00:16.214 --> 00:00:18.587
told me about a trip
he took to Uzbekistan.

00:00:18.897 --> 00:00:21.325
His role there was to help sell technology

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.016
that the Uzbek government could use
to spy on its own citizens.

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:27.889
He eventually shared with me
the marketing material

00:00:27.913 --> 00:00:30.032
he'd presented to the Uzbek government.

00:00:30.056 --> 00:00:35.082
One glossy brochure featured technology
that could not just intercept phone calls,

00:00:35.106 --> 00:00:36.689
but identify the caller,

00:00:36.713 --> 00:00:39.164
regardless of what phone number
they were using,

00:00:39.188 --> 00:00:41.283
based on their unique voiceprint,

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:44.577
and then identify their exact
geographic location.

00:00:44.926 --> 00:00:48.085
This is a guy who had been involved
with the arms trade for years.

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.617
He wasn't some Hollywood-type gunrunner
doing backroom deals.

00:00:51.641 --> 00:00:54.617
He was just a guy that worked
with legitimate Western companies

00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:56.586
to help sell their weapons abroad.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.499
But he wasn't bothered
by marketing this sort of technology.

00:00:59.523 --> 00:01:02.285
For him, it was just the next step
in the arms trade.

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.253
And it was even easier than, say,
selling weapons to Iraq,

00:01:05.277 --> 00:01:07.491
because it didn't require
an export license

00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:08.926
from the US State Department,

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.998
the way most arms sales would.

00:01:11.022 --> 00:01:13.133
It turns out that these
tools of surveillance

00:01:13.157 --> 00:01:15.244
are almost completely unregulated,

00:01:15.268 --> 00:01:18.442
because as of today,
they're not defined as weapons.

00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:21.378
But they should be, and we need
to regulate them that way.

00:01:21.688 --> 00:01:24.083
I'm a journalist
who has spent the last two decades

00:01:24.107 --> 00:01:26.479
looking at how the military
and intelligence world

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:28.942
spurs the development
of new science and technology.

00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:31.025
I've tracked the emergence of new weapons

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.498
and looked to see what happens

00:01:32.522 --> 00:01:35.164
when companies start to market
these weapons abroad.

00:01:35.188 --> 00:01:37.593
But what is a weapon
in the information age?

00:01:37.617 --> 00:01:39.549
We know that armed drones are weapons,

00:01:39.573 --> 00:01:41.537
missiles and bombs are weapons,

00:01:41.561 --> 00:01:43.657
but the State Department
actually classifies

00:01:43.681 --> 00:01:46.529
broad categories
of technologies as weapons.

00:01:46.553 --> 00:01:50.887
So for example, a scientist going abroad
on an oceanographic research vessel,

00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:53.268
they want to take
the latest night-vision goggles?

00:01:53.292 --> 00:01:56.585
That, according to the State Department,
is potentially a weapon.

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:57.775
Why?

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.085
Well, because though night-vision goggles
are used today by scientists

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:02.506
and hunters around the world,

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.347
it was a capability
first developed for the military.

00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:06.807
And yet, tools of surveillance

00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:10.246
that an authoritarian regime could use
to spy on its own citizens,

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.079
on dissidents, on journalists,

00:02:12.103 --> 00:02:15.190
that, according to the US government
today, is not a weapon.

00:02:15.587 --> 00:02:17.317
And yet, these tools of surveillance

00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:21.245
are part of a growing secretive
multi-billion-dollar industry.

00:02:21.848 --> 00:02:24.753
The genesis of this spy bazaar
goes back some 18 years,

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:26.792
to a Hilton hotel in northern Virginia,

00:02:26.816 --> 00:02:30.413
just a few miles away
from the US Central Intelligence Agency.

00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:33.079
A few dozen people,
mostly dark-suited men,

00:02:33.103 --> 00:02:35.190
gathered there in the spring of 2002

00:02:35.214 --> 00:02:38.324
for a conference with
the unassuming name of ISS World.

00:02:38.627 --> 00:02:42.405
You know, at first glance, this conference
probably looked like dozens of events

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:45.067
that used to take place
around the Washington, DC area.

00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:46.781
But this event was unique.

00:02:46.805 --> 00:02:49.749
ISS stands for Intelligence
Support Systems,

00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:51.185
and the people who were there

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.639
were from companies
that built technologies to spy

00:02:53.663 --> 00:02:55.513
on private communications.

00:02:55.537 --> 00:02:58.535
In other words, these were
sort of wire-tappers for hire.

00:02:58.855 --> 00:03:01.903
And the reason they were there
was that less than a year earlier,

00:03:01.927 --> 00:03:04.439
the 9/11 terrorist attacks
on New York and Washington

00:03:04.463 --> 00:03:07.323
had spurred the Congress
to press through legislation

00:03:07.347 --> 00:03:09.027
known as the Patriot Act.

00:03:09.347 --> 00:03:11.506
This gave the government
broad new authorities

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.744
to monitor communications.

00:03:13.768 --> 00:03:16.117
Emails, internet activity, phone calls,

00:03:16.141 --> 00:03:18.251
even financial transactions.

00:03:18.275 --> 00:03:21.149
This created an instant demand for data.

00:03:21.173 --> 00:03:23.784
And in the true American
entrepreneurial spirit,

00:03:23.808 --> 00:03:26.559
an industry rose up
to help collect this data.

00:03:27.004 --> 00:03:28.208
But back in 2002,

00:03:28.232 --> 00:03:30.266
this was still a pretty modest affair.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.512
Only about 10 percent
of the world's population

00:03:32.536 --> 00:03:34.464
was even online using the internet.

00:03:34.488 --> 00:03:38.741
So most of what was being collected
were simple emails and phone calls

00:03:38.765 --> 00:03:41.018
over landlines and cell phones.

00:03:41.042 --> 00:03:42.392
But over the next few years,

00:03:42.416 --> 00:03:45.367
the way that we communicate
began to change rapidly.

00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:47.783
There was the introduction
of Skype, Facebook

00:03:47.807 --> 00:03:49.966
and then, crucially, the iPhone,

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.181
and within a few years,

00:03:51.205 --> 00:03:54.539
billions of us were walking around
with little computers in our pockets

00:03:54.563 --> 00:03:57.243
that do everything
from monitor our exercise habits

00:03:57.267 --> 00:03:59.655
to help us find romantic partners.

00:04:00.022 --> 00:04:03.171
And suddenly, you didn't necessarily need
the advanced capability

00:04:03.195 --> 00:04:05.770
of the National Security Agency
or big telecoms

00:04:05.794 --> 00:04:08.042
to monitor everyone's communication.

00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:09.247
In some cases,

00:04:09.271 --> 00:04:12.514
all you needed was access
to that device in their pockets.

00:04:12.538 --> 00:04:15.926
And that gave birth to an entirely
new type of industry.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.331
You know, not many companies
can build missiles or aircraft,

00:04:19.355 --> 00:04:22.605
but it doesn't take a lot of capital
to create software

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:25.013
that can hack into someone's smartphone.

00:04:25.037 --> 00:04:27.101
Computer hackers
have been around for years,

00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:30.125
but now their skills could be used
to build technologies

00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:32.259
that were in high demand
by law enforcement

00:04:32.283 --> 00:04:34.016
and intelligence agencies.

00:04:34.363 --> 00:04:37.363
And soon, dozens
and even hundreds of companies

00:04:37.387 --> 00:04:40.045
were getting into this
wire-tappers' market.

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:42.180
And that little conference in Virginia,

00:04:42.204 --> 00:04:45.948
it grew and soon became known
as the Wiretappers' Ball.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.734
Well, not much was known
about the Wiretappers' Ball

00:04:48.758 --> 00:04:49.908
in those early years,

00:04:49.932 --> 00:04:52.139
because the conferences
were closed to everyone

00:04:52.163 --> 00:04:54.829
except the companies
and their government customers.

00:04:54.853 --> 00:04:57.330
But journalists did begin to see
and hear reports

00:04:57.354 --> 00:05:00.386
of companies getting
into this private spy market.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.033
Spooky entrepreneurs
going around the world,

00:05:03.057 --> 00:05:04.235
doing deals,

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.211
often with authoritarian regimes.

00:05:06.235 --> 00:05:09.831
And it was, from the start,
a really loosely regulated market.

00:05:10.188 --> 00:05:14.227
Some countries do require permission
to sell these technologies abroad,

00:05:14.251 --> 00:05:18.267
but rarely with the type of scrutiny
that is given to traditional arms.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.029
So for example, the Italian-based
company Hacking Team

00:05:22.053 --> 00:05:24.852
reportedly sold its technology
to authoritarian regimes

00:05:24.876 --> 00:05:26.556
in Egypt and Kazakhstan.

00:05:27.018 --> 00:05:30.815
The Israeli-based company NSO Group
has reportedly sold its technology

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:32.625
to the regime in Saudi Arabia,

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:34.491
which has been accused of harassing,

00:05:34.515 --> 00:05:37.569
and even, in one case,
killing one of its political opponents.

00:05:37.982 --> 00:05:42.137
And we do think of weapons
as things that kill people.

00:05:42.161 --> 00:05:43.470
But in the information age,

00:05:43.494 --> 00:05:47.414
some of the most powerful weapons
are things that can track and identify us.

00:05:47.724 --> 00:05:51.034
This is something that the Pentagon
and CIA have recognized for years,

00:05:51.058 --> 00:05:52.930
and they've tried to build technologies

00:05:52.954 --> 00:05:56.579
that can track people,
suspected terrorists, around the globe.

00:05:56.904 --> 00:05:59.943
The Pentagon has invested
in something called smart dust,

00:05:59.967 --> 00:06:02.555
little microsensors
the size of specs of dust

00:06:02.579 --> 00:06:05.589
that you could scatter on people
without them knowing it,

00:06:05.613 --> 00:06:07.835
and then use it to track their location.

00:06:07.859 --> 00:06:10.447
The Pentagon, through
its venture capital firm,

00:06:10.471 --> 00:06:14.783
has invested in a beauty products company
once featured in "Oprah Magazine"

00:06:14.807 --> 00:06:17.807
to build a device that could
surreptitiously collect DNA

00:06:17.831 --> 00:06:20.031
just by swiping across the skin.

00:06:20.537 --> 00:06:23.473
But something remarkable has happened
over the past decade.

00:06:23.497 --> 00:06:26.467
In many cases, what the private
marketplace has been able to do

00:06:26.491 --> 00:06:30.721
has far outstripped what the Pentagon
or CIA even thought was possible.

00:06:30.745 --> 00:06:31.921
Back in 2008,

00:06:31.945 --> 00:06:36.087
the Pentagon had a secretive database
of DNA from terrorists.

00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:38.436
It had about 80,000 samples.

00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:41.371
Well, the private company AncestryDNA

00:06:41.395 --> 00:06:44.728
today has samples
from over 15 million people.

00:06:44.752 --> 00:06:48.263
23andMe, the second-largest
genealogical database,

00:06:48.287 --> 00:06:50.724
has samples from over 10 million people.

00:06:50.748 --> 00:06:54.343
So now, maybe you don't need
these James Bond-worthy techniques

00:06:54.367 --> 00:06:55.961
of collecting DNA

00:06:55.985 --> 00:06:58.937
if we're willingly handing it over
to private companies

00:06:58.961 --> 00:07:01.410
and even paying for the honor of doing it.

00:07:01.807 --> 00:07:05.138
Well, what could you do
with a sample of someone's DNA?

00:07:05.162 --> 00:07:06.679
In the United States and China,

00:07:06.703 --> 00:07:09.178
researchers are working
on using DNA samples

00:07:09.202 --> 00:07:11.520
to build images of people's faces.

00:07:11.544 --> 00:07:15.513
So if you pair DNA
with facial recognition technology,

00:07:15.537 --> 00:07:18.600
you have the basis of a really
powerful surveillance system

00:07:18.624 --> 00:07:22.449
that could be used to track individuals
or entire ethnic groups.

00:07:22.473 --> 00:07:24.861
And if you think that sounds
a little bit paranoid,

00:07:24.885 --> 00:07:27.625
keep in mind that the Pentagon
last year sent out a memo

00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:29.537
to all of its service members,

00:07:29.561 --> 00:07:32.815
warning them precisely not to use
those commercial DNA kits

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:35.689
over concerns that information
could be used to track them

00:07:35.713 --> 00:07:37.679
or their family members.

00:07:37.703 --> 00:07:41.926
And yet, even with the Pentagon
raising concerns about this technology,

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.878
almost nothing has been done
to reign in this market.

00:07:44.902 --> 00:07:47.109
One American company, Clearview AI,

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:49.760
has been collecting billions
of images of people's faces

00:07:49.784 --> 00:07:51.196
from across the internet,

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.371
like those pictures you post on Instagram
of you and your friends and family,

00:07:55.395 --> 00:07:57.649
and then selling its facial
recognition services

00:07:57.673 --> 00:08:00.506
to US government
and law-enforcement agencies.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:01.704
And even if you think

00:08:01.728 --> 00:08:04.738
that's a perfectly acceptable
application of this technology,

00:08:04.762 --> 00:08:08.198
there's nothing to stop them
from selling to private individuals,

00:08:08.222 --> 00:08:11.101
corporations or even foreign governments.

00:08:11.125 --> 00:08:13.823
And that's exactly
what some companies are doing.

00:08:13.847 --> 00:08:17.085
That Wiretappers' Ball
that started in northern Virginia?

00:08:17.109 --> 00:08:20.932
Today, it's held in multiple cities
around the globe.

00:08:20.956 --> 00:08:25.083
Thousands of people now attend
the ISS trainings and conferences.

00:08:25.107 --> 00:08:28.829
And more of the companies showing up
are coming from the Middle East and China.

00:08:28.853 --> 00:08:30.987
The spy bazaar has gone global.

00:08:31.545 --> 00:08:33.446
And at arms shows now around the world,

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:36.531
you'll see companies displaying
facial recognition technology

00:08:36.555 --> 00:08:38.139
and phone hacking software,

00:08:38.163 --> 00:08:41.022
displaying right next
to traditional arms manufacturers

00:08:41.046 --> 00:08:42.903
with tanks and missiles.

00:08:42.927 --> 00:08:44.642
And walking around these arms shows,

00:08:44.666 --> 00:08:47.617
it's pretty easy to go down
dystopian rabbit holes,

00:08:47.641 --> 00:08:49.759
thinking about future
surveillance technology

00:08:49.783 --> 00:08:51.529
that will track our every move.

00:08:51.553 --> 00:08:53.696
And I remember one
Pentagon adviser telling me

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.816
that what the military really needed
were space-based satellites

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.839
that could track people anywhere on earth
based just on their DNA.

00:09:00.863 --> 00:09:03.656
It's enough to make you invest
in tinfoil hats.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.839
But the truth is,

00:09:04.863 --> 00:09:07.958
we don't know what sort
of technology the future will bring.

00:09:07.982 --> 00:09:10.942
But we know that today,
in the absence of regulation,

00:09:10.966 --> 00:09:13.243
this marketplace is already exploding.

00:09:13.267 --> 00:09:16.957
And in fact, one of those companies
accused of selling surveillance technology

00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:18.608
to authoritarian regimes,

00:09:18.632 --> 00:09:23.146
today, it's offering to help track
those infected with COVID-19.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.091
And of course, technology does offer
the tantalizing promise

00:09:26.115 --> 00:09:29.434
of helping control a pandemic
through contact tracing.

00:09:29.458 --> 00:09:33.101
But it also opens up another door,
to privatized mass surveillance.

00:09:33.696 --> 00:09:36.704
So what do we do
about this private spy bazaar?

00:09:37.005 --> 00:09:38.926
We can hide, go offline,

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:41.735
get off social media,
ditch our smartphones,

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:43.244
go live in a cave,

00:09:43.268 --> 00:09:46.148
but the truth is, we're not trained
to be professional spies,

00:09:46.172 --> 00:09:49.490
we can't live under false identities
or with no identities.

00:09:49.902 --> 00:09:53.617
And even real spies are having a hard time
staying below the radar, these days.

00:09:53.641 --> 00:09:56.346
It doesn't matter how many
passports Jason Bourne has

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.237
if his face or DNA
is in someone's database.

00:09:59.767 --> 00:10:02.879
But if even governments have lost control
of the tools of spying,

00:10:02.903 --> 00:10:04.918
is there anything we can do about it?

00:10:04.942 --> 00:10:06.109
One argument I've heard

00:10:06.133 --> 00:10:08.426
is that even if the US
were to restrict companies

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.537
from selling this sort
of technology abroad,

00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:12.961
companies based in China
might simply step in.

00:10:13.457 --> 00:10:15.815
But we regulate the arms trade today,

00:10:15.839 --> 00:10:17.772
even if we do it imperfectly.

00:10:18.466 --> 00:10:21.491
And in fact, there was a multilateral
proposal several years ago

00:10:21.515 --> 00:10:22.672
to do just that,

00:10:22.696 --> 00:10:25.632
to require export licenses
for surveillance software.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.046
The United States
was among those countries

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.629
that agreed to these
voluntary regulations,

00:10:30.653 --> 00:10:33.914
but back in Washington,
this proposal has simply languished.

00:10:33.938 --> 00:10:37.137
We have an administration
that would rather sell more weapons abroad

00:10:37.161 --> 00:10:38.352
with fewer restrictions,

00:10:38.376 --> 00:10:40.145
including to some of those countries

00:10:40.169 --> 00:10:42.200
accused of abusing
surveillance technology.

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:45.574
I think to move forward,
we would need to revive that proposal,

00:10:45.598 --> 00:10:47.534
but even go one step further.

00:10:47.558 --> 00:10:51.241
We need to fundamentally change
how we think of surveillance technology

00:10:51.265 --> 00:10:53.716
and define these tools as weapons.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.066
This would allow government

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.923
to regulate and control
their sale and export

00:10:57.947 --> 00:11:00.633
the way that they control
traditional arms,

00:11:00.657 --> 00:11:02.724
advanced aircraft and missiles.

00:11:03.074 --> 00:11:06.804
But that means recognizing
that technology that tracks who we are,

00:11:06.828 --> 00:11:08.614
what we do, what we say,

00:11:08.638 --> 00:11:10.765
and even in some cases, what we think,

00:11:10.789 --> 00:11:12.789
is a form of advanced weaponry.

00:11:12.813 --> 00:11:14.936
And these weapons
are growing too powerful,

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.691
available to the highest bidder,

00:11:16.715 --> 00:11:19.127
and according to the whims
of the spy bazaar.

00:11:19.532 --> 00:11:20.682
Thank you.
