00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.160
Have you ever watched
a baby learning to crawl?

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.176
Because as any
parent knows, it's gripping.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.096
First, they wriggle about on the floor,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.336
usually backwards,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.376
but then they drag themselves forwards,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.296
and then they pull themselves up to stand,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.176
and we all clap.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.176
And that simple motion
of forwards and upwards,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.600
it's the most basic direction
of progress we humans recognize.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.816
We tell it in our story
of evolution as well,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.856
from our lolloping ancestors
to Homo erectus, finally upright,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.336
to Homo sapiens, depicted, always a man,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.760
always mid-stride.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.136
So no wonder we so readily believe

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.896
that economic progress
will take this very same shape,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.560
this ever-rising line of growth.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.696
It's time to think again,

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.280
to reimagine the shape of progress,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.736
because today, we have economies

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.320
that need to grow,
whether or not they make us thrive,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.496
and what we need,
especially in the richest countries,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.936
are economies that make us thrive

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.896
whether or not they grow.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.016
Yes, it's a little flippant word

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.336
hiding a profound shift in mindset,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.016
but I believe this is the shift
we need to make

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.720
if we, humanity, are going to thrive
here together this century.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.616
So where did this obsession
with growth come from?

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.736
Well, GDP, gross domestic product,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.336
it's just the total cost
of goods and services

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.496
sold in an economy in a year.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.056
It was invented in the 1930s,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.056
but it very soon became
the overriding goal of policymaking,

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.816
so much so that even today,
in the richest of countries,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.776
governments think that the solution
to their economic problems

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.360
lies in more growth.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.576
Just how that happened

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.696
is best told through
the 1960 classic by W.W. Rostow.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.120
I love it so much,
I have a first-edition copy.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.416
"The Stages of Economic Growth:
A Non-Communist Manifesto."

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.176
(Laughter)

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.936
You can just smell the politics, huh?

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.976
And Rostow tells us that all economies

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.416
need to pass through
five stages of growth:

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.016
first, traditional society,
where a nation's output is limited

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.056
by its technology,
its institutions and mindset;

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.736
but then the preconditions for takeoff,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.136
where we get the beginnings
of a banking industry,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.416
the mechanization of work

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.136
and the belief that growth is necessary
for something beyond itself,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.176
like national dignity
or a better life for the children;

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.016
then takeoff, where compound interest
is built into the economy's institutions

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.976
and growth becomes the normal condition;

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.696
fourth is the drive to maturity
where you can have any industry you want,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.736
no matter your natural resource base;

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.176
and the fifth and final stage,
the age of high-mass consumption

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.776
where people can buy
all the consumer goods they want,

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.896
like bicycles and sewing machines --

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.680
this was 1960, remember.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.600
Well, you can hear the implicit
airplane metaphor in this story,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.240
but this plane is like no other,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.400
because it can never be allowed to land.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.400
Rostow left us flying
into the sunset of mass consumerism,

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.640
and he knew it.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.480
As he wrote,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.320
"And then the question beyond,

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.520
where history offers us only fragments.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.680
What to do when the increase
in real income itself loses its charm?"

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.056
He asked that question,
but he never answered it, and here's why.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.616
The year was 1960,

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.416
he was an advisor to the presidential
candidate John F. Kennedy,

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.376
who was running for election
on the promise of five-percent growth,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.896
so Rostow's job was
to keep that plane flying,

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.280
not to ask if, how, or when
it could ever be allowed to land.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.016
So here we are, flying into the sunset
of mass consumerism

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.480
over half a century on,

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.456
with economies that have come
to expect, demand and depend upon

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.055
unending growth,

00:04:29.079 --> 00:04:32.880
because we're financially,
politically and socially addicted to it.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.256
We're financially addicted to growth,
because today's financial system

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.576
is designed to pursue
the highest rate of monetary return,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.096
putting publicly traded companies
under constant pressure

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.456
to deliver growing sales,
growing market share and growing profits,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.976
and because banks create money
as debt bearing interest,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.480
which must be repaid with more.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.936
We're politically addicted to growth

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.096
because politicians
want to raise tax revenue

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.536
without raising taxes

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.656
and a growing GDP
seems a sure way to do that.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.256
And no politician wants to lose
their place in the G-20 family photo.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.496
(Laughter)

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.216
But if their economy stops growing
while the rest keep going,

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.576
well, they'll be booted out
by the next emerging powerhouse.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.776
And we are socially addicted to growth,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.616
because thanks to a century
of consumer propaganda,

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.856
which fascinatingly
was created by Edward Bernays,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.576
the nephew of Sigmund Freud,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.616
who realized that
his uncle's psychotherapy

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.896
could be turned into
very lucrative retail therapy

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.096
if we could be convinced
to believe that we transform ourselves

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.400
every time we buy something more.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.256
None of these addictions
are insurmountable,

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.456
but they all deserve far more attention
than they currently get,

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.896
because look where this journey
has been taking us.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.256
Global GDP is 10 times bigger
than it was in 1950

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.480
and that increase has brought
prosperity to billions of people,

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.536
but the global economy
has also become incredibly divisive,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.656
with the vast share of returns to wealth

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.856
now accruing to a fraction
of the global one percent.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.536
And the economy has become
incredibly degenerative,

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.336
rapidly destabilizing
this delicately balanced planet

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.200
on which all of our lives depend.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.096
Our politicians know it, and so they offer
new destinations for growth.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.216
You can have green growth,
inclusive growth,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.216
smart, resilient, balanced growth.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.640
Choose any future you want
so long as you choose growth.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.976
I think it's time to choose
a higher ambition, a far bigger one,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.456
because humanity's
21st century challenge is clear:

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.256
to meet the needs of all people

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.776
within the means of this
extraordinary, unique, living planet

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.320
so that we and the rest
of nature can thrive.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.656
Progress on this goal isn't going
to be measured with the metric of money.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.016
We need a dashboard of indicators.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.456
And when I sat down to try and draw
a picture of what that might look like,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.776
strange though this is going to sound,

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.120
it came out looking like a doughnut.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.376
I know, I'm sorry,

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.696
but let me introduce you
to the one doughnut

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.056
that might actually turn out
to be good for us.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.296
So imagine humanity's resource use
radiating out from the middle.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.976
That hole in the middle is a place

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.456
where people are falling short
on life's essentials.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.616
They don't have the food, health care,
education, political voice, housing

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.456
that every person needs
for a life of dignity and opportunity.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.696
We want to get everybody out of the hole,
over the social foundation

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.720
and into that green doughnut itself.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.200
But, and it's a big but,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:48.056
we cannot let our collective resource use
overshoot that outer circle,

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.496
the ecological ceiling,

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.336
because there we put so much pressure
on this extraordinary planet

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.536
that we begin to kick it out of kilter.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.536
We cause climate breakdown,
we acidify the oceans,

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.616
a hole in the ozone layer,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.816
pushing ourselves
beyond the planetary boundaries

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.496
of the life-supporting systems
that have for the last 11,000 years

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.640
made earth such a benevolent
home to humanity.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.736
So this double-sided challenge
to meet the needs of all

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.256
within the means of the planet,

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.536
it invites a new shape of progress,

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.536
no longer this ever-rising line of growth,

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.496
but a sweet spot for humanity,

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.056
thriving in dynamic balance
between the foundation and the ceiling.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.696
And I was really struck
once I'd drawn this picture

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:37.016
to realize that the symbol of well-being
in many ancient cultures

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.616
reflects this very same sense
of dynamic balance,

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.536
from the Maori Takarangi

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.936
to the Taoist Yin Yang,
the Buddhist endless knot,

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.480
the Celtic double spiral.

00:08:47.919 --> 00:08:51.320
So can we find this dynamic balance
in the 21st century?

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.176
Well, that's a key question,

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:58.856
because as these red wedges show,
right now we are far from balanced,

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:02.056
falling short and overshooting
at the same time.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.656
Look in that hole, you can see that
millions or billions of people worldwide

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.320
still fall short
on their most basic of needs.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.616
And yet, we've already overshot at least
four of these planetary boundaries,

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.216
risking irreversible impact
of climate breakdown

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.960
and ecosystem collapse.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.520
This is the state of humanity
and our planetary home.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.400
We, the people of the early 21st century,

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.760
this is our selfie.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.336
No economist from last century
saw this picture,

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.416
so why would we imagine
that their theories

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.416
would be up for taking on its challenges?

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.856
We need ideas of our own,

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.576
because we are the first
generation to see this

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.360
and probably the last with a real chance
of turning this story around.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.056
You see, 20th century economics assured us
that if growth creates inequality,

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.576
don't try to redistribute,

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.816
because more growth
will even things up again.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.656
If growth creates pollution,

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.200
don't try to regulate, because more growth
will clean things up again.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.176
Except, it turns out, it doesn't,

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.656
and it won't.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.856
We need to create economies that tackle
this shortfall and overshoot together,

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.416
by design.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:16.016
We need economies that are regenerative
and distributive by design.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.736
You see, we've inherited
degenerative industries.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.856
We take earth's materials,
make them into stuff we want,

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.496
use it for a while, often only once,
and then throw it away,

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.216
and that is pushing us
over planetary boundaries,

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.736
so we need to bend those arrows around,

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.976
create economies that work with and within
the cycles of the living world,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.056
so that resources are never used up
but used again and again,

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.056
economies that run on sunlight,

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.616
where waste from one process
is food for the next.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.496
And this kind of regenerative design
is popping up everywhere.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.936
Over a hundred cities worldwide,
from Quito to Oslo,

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.816
from Harare to Hobart,

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:56.296
already generate more than 70 percent
of their electricity

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.696
from sun, wind and waves.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:03.816
Cities like London, Glasgow, Amsterdam
are pioneering circular city design,

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.976
finding ways to turn the waste
from one urban process

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.776
into food for the next.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.096
And from Tigray, Ethiopia
to Queensland, Australia,

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.336
farmers and foresters are regenerating
once-barren landscapes

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.520
so that it teems with life again.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.776
But as well as being
regenerative by design,

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.256
our economies must be
distributive by design,

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:30.536
and we've got unprecedented
opportunities for making that happen,

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.816
because 20th-century
centralized technologies,

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.336
institutions,

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.616
concentrated wealth,
knowledge and power in few hands.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:44.256
This century, we can design
our technologies and institutions

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.536
to distribute wealth, knowledge
and empowerment to many.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.296
Instead of fossil fuel energy
and large-scale manufacturing,

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.360
we've got renewable energy networks,
digital platforms and 3D printing.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.456
200 years of corporate control
of intellectual property is being upended

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:06.216
by the bottom-up, open-source,
peer-to-peer knowledge commons.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.696
And corporations that still pursue
maximum rate of return

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.016
for their shareholders,

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.336
well they suddenly look rather out of date

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.296
next to social enterprises
that are designed to generate

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.960
multiple forms of value and share it
with those throughout their networks.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.176
If we can harness today's technologies,

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.896
from AI to blockchain

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.096
to the Internet of Things
to material science,

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.416
if we can harness these
in service of distributive design,

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.376
we can ensure that health care, education,
finance, energy, political voice

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.680
reaches and empowers those people
who need it most.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.856
You see, regenerative
and distributive design

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.440
create extraordinary opportunities
for the 21st-century economy.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.576
So where does this leave
Rostow's airplane ride?

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.056
Well, for some it still carries
the hope of endless green growth,

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.376
the idea that thanks to dematerialization,

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.000
exponential GDP growth can go on forever
while resource use keeps falling.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.960
But look at the data.
This is a flight of fancy.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.976
Yes, we need to dematerialize
our economies,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.416
but this dependency on unending growth
cannot be decoupled from resource use

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.816
on anything like the scale required

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.600
to bring us safely back
within planetary boundaries.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.816
I know this way of thinking
about growth is unfamiliar,

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.896
because growth is good, no?

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.856
We want our children to grow,
our gardens to grow.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.136
Yes, look to nature and growth
is a wonderful, healthy source of life.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:40.376
It's a phase, but many economies
like Ethiopia and Nepal today

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.776
may be in that phase.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.240
Their economies are growing
at seven percent a year.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.456
But look again to nature,

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.576
because from your children's feet
to the Amazon forest,

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.536
nothing in nature grows forever.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.616
Things grow, and they grow up
and they mature,

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.416
and it's only by doing so

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.160
that they can thrive for a very long time.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.496
We already know this.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.336
If I told you my friend went to the doctor

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.120
who told her she had a growth

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.056
that feels very different,

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:18.136
because we intuitively understand
that when something tries to grow forever

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.536
within a healthy, living, thriving system,

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.520
it's a threat to the health of the whole.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.736
So why would we imagine that our economies

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.456
would be the one system
that could buck this trend

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.400
and succeed by growing forever?

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:38.296
We urgently need financial,
political and social innovations

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.896
that enable us to overcome
this structural dependency on growth,

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.400
so that we can instead
focus on thriving and balance

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:51.720
within the social and the ecological
boundaries of the doughnut.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:59.016
And if the mere idea of boundaries
makes you feel, well, bounded,

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.816
think again.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.616
Because the world's most ingenious people

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.640
turn boundaries into
the source of their creativity.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.416
From Mozart on his five-octave piano

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.176
Jimi Hendrix on his six-string guitar,

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.920
Serena Williams on a tennis court,

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.160
it's boundaries
that unleash our potential.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:25.536
And the doughnut's boundaries unleash
the potential for humanity to thrive

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:30.480
with boundless creativity,
participation, belonging and meaning.

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:37.256
It's going to take all the ingenuity
that we have got to get there,

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.896
so bring it on.

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.136
Thank you.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:45.520
(Applause)
