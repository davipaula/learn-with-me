00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.651
The longest journey
that I have ever taken.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.314
That was in 2002.

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.298
I was only 19 years old.

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:24.475
It was the first time
I had ever been on an airplane

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:27.304
and the first time
that I had left my country,

00:00:27.328 --> 00:00:28.478
Rwanda.

00:00:29.423 --> 00:00:32.614
I had to move thousands of kilometers away

00:00:32.638 --> 00:00:33.918
to follow a dream.

00:00:34.262 --> 00:00:37.274
A dream I have had
ever since I was a child.

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:41.862
And that dream was to become an architect.

00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:45.865
That was impossible
at the time in my country.

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:47.720
There were no schools of architecture.

00:00:48.426 --> 00:00:51.487
So when I got a scholarship
to study in China,

00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:54.217
I left my life and my family behind

00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:56.082
and I moved to Shanghai.

00:00:56.724 --> 00:00:58.741
It was an amazing time.

00:00:59.252 --> 00:01:03.579
This country was going through
a major building boom.

00:01:03.603 --> 00:01:05.386
Shanghai, my new home,

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.952
was quickly turning
into a skyscraper city.

00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:10.935
China was changing.

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:15.395
World-class projects were built
to convey a new image of development.

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:21.579
Modern, striking engineering marvels
were going up literally everywhere.

00:01:22.493 --> 00:01:25.188
But behind these facades,

00:01:25.212 --> 00:01:29.434
exploitation of huge numbers
of migrant workers,

00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:32.615
massive displacement
of thousands of people

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:34.662
made these projects possible.

00:01:35.042 --> 00:01:36.968
And this fast-paced development

00:01:36.992 --> 00:01:39.979
also contributed significantly
to the pollution

00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:41.639
that is haunting China today.

00:01:42.758 --> 00:01:44.696
Fast-forward to 2010,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.848
when I went back home to Rwanda.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.572
There, I found development patterns
similar to what I saw in China.

00:01:52.087 --> 00:01:58.059
The country was and still is experiencing
its own population and economic growth.

00:01:58.574 --> 00:02:01.749
The pressure to build cities,
infrastructure and buildings

00:02:01.773 --> 00:02:03.669
is at its peak,

00:02:03.693 --> 00:02:04.915
and as a result,

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.343
there is a massive building boom as well.

00:02:08.392 --> 00:02:13.266
This is the reality across
the entire continent of Africa,

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.440
and here's why.

00:02:14.913 --> 00:02:18.021
By 2050, Africa's population will double,

00:02:18.045 --> 00:02:21.532
reaching 2.5 billion people.

00:02:22.323 --> 00:02:23.935
At this point,

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.990
the African population will be
slightly less than the current population

00:02:29.014 --> 00:02:33.156
of China and India combined.

00:02:34.963 --> 00:02:39.932
The infrastructure and buildings needed
to accommodate this many people

00:02:39.956 --> 00:02:43.491
is unprecedented
in the history of humankind.

00:02:44.072 --> 00:02:47.410
We have estimated that by 2050,

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:52.652
we have to build
700,000,000 more housing units,

00:02:52.676 --> 00:02:55.664
more than 300,000 schools

00:02:55.688 --> 00:02:59.677
and nearly 100,000 health centers.

00:03:01.173 --> 00:03:03.840
Let me put that into perspective for you.

00:03:04.902 --> 00:03:08.584
Every day for the next 35 years,

00:03:08.608 --> 00:03:11.521
we have to build seven health centers,

00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:13.403
25 schools

00:03:13.427 --> 00:03:18.129
and nearly 60,000 housing units each day,

00:03:18.153 --> 00:03:19.443
every day.

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:24.911
How are we going to build all of this?

00:03:25.698 --> 00:03:30.055
Are we going to follow a model
of unsustainable building and construction

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.295
similar to what I witnessed in China?

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.352
Or can we develop a uniquely African model

00:03:36.376 --> 00:03:39.448
of sustainable and equitable development?

00:03:39.905 --> 00:03:41.594
I'm optimistic we can.

00:03:41.992 --> 00:03:44.560
I know Africans who are already doing it.

00:03:45.334 --> 00:03:48.374
Take Nigerian architect
Kunlé Adeyemi for instance,

00:03:48.398 --> 00:03:51.635
and his work in slums
of coastal megacities.

00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:55.042
Places like Makoko in Lagos,

00:03:55.066 --> 00:03:59.827
where hundreds of thousands of people
live in makeshift structures on stilts

00:03:59.851 --> 00:04:01.028
on water,

00:04:01.052 --> 00:04:03.459
without government
infrastructure or services.

00:04:04.272 --> 00:04:09.842
A community at great risk
of rising sea levels and climate change.

00:04:10.223 --> 00:04:14.576
And yet, people who live here
are examples of great ingenuity

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.621
and the will to survive.

00:04:16.645 --> 00:04:19.720
Kunlé and his team have designed
a prototype school

00:04:19.744 --> 00:04:22.713
that is resilient to rising sea levels.

00:04:22.737 --> 00:04:24.989
This is Makoko School.

00:04:26.502 --> 00:04:30.707
It's a floating prototype structure
that can be adapted to clinics,

00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:33.480
to housing, to markets

00:04:33.504 --> 00:04:36.052
and other vital infrastructure
this community needs.

00:04:36.076 --> 00:04:38.116
It's an ingenious solution

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.894
that can ensure this community
lives safely on the waters of Lagos.

00:04:43.895 --> 00:04:45.950
This is Francis Kéré.

00:04:46.726 --> 00:04:48.775
He works in the country
where he comes from,

00:04:48.799 --> 00:04:49.949
Burkina Faso.

00:04:50.374 --> 00:04:55.930
Kéré and his team have designed projects
that use traditional building techniques.

00:04:56.434 --> 00:04:59.089
Kéré and his team
working in the communities

00:04:59.113 --> 00:05:01.934
have developed prototype schools

00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:03.450
that the whole community,

00:05:03.474 --> 00:05:07.098
similar to every project
in the villages of this country,

00:05:07.122 --> 00:05:09.010
comes together to build.

00:05:10.028 --> 00:05:13.011
Children bring stones for the foundation,

00:05:13.035 --> 00:05:16.366
women bring water
for the brick manufacturing,

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.042
and everybody works together
to pound the clay floors.

00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:22.232
Working with the community,

00:05:22.256 --> 00:05:25.891
Kéré and his team have created
projects that function better,

00:05:25.915 --> 00:05:28.551
with adequate lighting
and adequate ventilation.

00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:32.303
They're appropriate
for this particular context

00:05:32.327 --> 00:05:34.153
and really, really beautiful as well.

00:05:34.881 --> 00:05:36.644
For the past seven years,

00:05:36.668 --> 00:05:40.242
I have been working as an architect
at MASS Design Group.

00:05:40.266 --> 00:05:42.983
It's a design firm that began in Rwanda.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.710
We have worked
in several countries in Africa,

00:05:47.734 --> 00:05:52.047
focusing on this more equitable
and sustainable model

00:05:52.071 --> 00:05:53.911
of architectural practice,

00:05:53.935 --> 00:05:56.155
and Malawi is one of those countries.

00:05:56.587 --> 00:05:59.991
It's a country with beautiful,
remote landscapes

00:06:00.015 --> 00:06:02.988
with high-peak mountains
and fertile valleys.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.455
But it also has one of the worst
maternal mortality rates in the world.

00:06:09.067 --> 00:06:12.544
A pregnant woman in Malawi
either gives birth at home,

00:06:12.568 --> 00:06:16.554
or she has to walk a really long journey
to the nearest clinic.

00:06:17.535 --> 00:06:22.974
And one out of 36 of these mothers
dies during childbirth.

00:06:24.647 --> 00:06:25.798
In Malawi,

00:06:25.822 --> 00:06:27.712
with our team at MASS Design Group,

00:06:27.736 --> 00:06:30.146
we designed the Kasungu
Maternity Waiting Village.

00:06:30.856 --> 00:06:34.869
This is a place women come to
six weeks before their due dates.

00:06:35.733 --> 00:06:37.591
Here they receive prenatal care

00:06:37.615 --> 00:06:41.051
and train in nutrition
and family planning.

00:06:41.604 --> 00:06:44.172
At the same time, they form a community

00:06:44.196 --> 00:06:46.715
with other expectant mothers
and their families.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.485
The design of the of Kasungu
Maternity Waiting Village

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:55.613
borrows from the vernacular
typologies of Malawi villages

00:06:55.637 --> 00:06:59.840
and is built using really simple
materials and techniques.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:05.015
The earth blocks that we used
were made from the same soil of this site.

00:07:05.803 --> 00:07:09.096
This reduces the carbon footprint
of this building,

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.191
but first and foremost,

00:07:11.215 --> 00:07:16.842
it provides a safe and dignified space
for these expectant mothers.

00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:20.305
These examples show
that architecture and design

00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:26.260
have the power and the agency
to address complex problems.

00:07:27.885 --> 00:07:30.617
But more to point,

00:07:30.641 --> 00:07:34.338
that we can develop
a model of effective solutions

00:07:34.362 --> 00:07:35.741
for our communities.

00:07:36.476 --> 00:07:39.016
But these three examples are not enough.

00:07:40.128 --> 00:07:43.358
300 more examples will not be enough.

00:07:44.198 --> 00:07:49.556
We need a whole community
of African architects and designers

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.503
to lead with thousands more examples.

00:07:53.182 --> 00:07:55.024
In May of this year,

00:07:55.048 --> 00:07:58.619
we convened a symposium
on African architecture, in Kigali,

00:07:58.643 --> 00:08:02.341
and we invited many
of the leading African designers

00:08:02.365 --> 00:08:05.984
and architectural educators
working across the continent.

00:08:06.617 --> 00:08:08.666
We all had one thing in common.

00:08:10.398 --> 00:08:14.565
Every single one of us
went to school abroad

00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:16.470
and outside of Africa.

00:08:16.494 --> 00:08:18.081
This has to change.

00:08:19.271 --> 00:08:22.628
If we are to develop
solutions unique to us,

00:08:22.652 --> 00:08:26.128
rather than attempting to turn
Kigali into Beijing,

00:08:26.152 --> 00:08:28.637
or Lagos into Shenzhen,

00:08:28.661 --> 00:08:30.415
we need a community

00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:33.764
that will build the design confidence
of the next generation

00:08:33.788 --> 00:08:36.166
of African architects and designers.

00:08:36.846 --> 00:08:44.316
(Applause)

00:08:44.719 --> 00:08:46.031
In September last year,

00:08:46.055 --> 00:08:49.135
we launched the African Design Centre

00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:51.864
to start building this community.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.917
We admitted 11 fellows
from across the continent.

00:08:58.021 --> 00:09:02.359
It's a 20-month-long,
design-build fellowship program.

00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:05.981
Here, they are learning
to tackle big challenges

00:09:06.005 --> 00:09:08.517
such as urbanism and climate change,

00:09:08.541 --> 00:09:10.320
as Kunlé and his team have.

00:09:11.367 --> 00:09:12.950
They're working with communities

00:09:12.974 --> 00:09:17.058
to develop innovative
building solutions and processes,

00:09:17.082 --> 00:09:19.287
as Kéré and his team have.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:24.231
They're learning to understand
the health impact of better buildings

00:09:24.255 --> 00:09:27.731
as we at MASS Design Group
have been researching

00:09:27.755 --> 00:09:29.361
for the past several years.

00:09:29.896 --> 00:09:32.208
The crowning moment of the fellowship

00:09:32.232 --> 00:09:35.875
is a real project
that they designed and built.

00:09:36.407 --> 00:09:38.924
This is Ruhehe Primary School,

00:09:38.948 --> 00:09:40.407
the project they designed.

00:09:40.431 --> 00:09:44.734
They immersed themselves in the community
to understand the challenges

00:09:44.758 --> 00:09:47.063
but also uncover opportunities,

00:09:47.087 --> 00:09:51.219
like using a wall
made of local volcanic stone

00:09:51.243 --> 00:09:55.320
to turn the entire campus
into a space of play and active learning.

00:09:56.644 --> 00:09:59.490
They evaluated
the environmental conditions

00:09:59.514 --> 00:10:02.768
and developed a roof system
that maximizes daylight

00:10:02.792 --> 00:10:04.850
and improves acoustic performance.

00:10:05.243 --> 00:10:09.433
The construction at Ruhehe Primary School
will begin this year.

00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:16.735
(Applause)

00:10:16.759 --> 00:10:18.243
And over the coming months,

00:10:18.267 --> 00:10:21.873
the African Design Centre fellows
are going to work hand-in-hand

00:10:21.897 --> 00:10:24.434
with the Ruhehe community to build it.

00:10:25.493 --> 00:10:26.736
When we asked the fellows

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.552
what they want to do after
their African Design Centre fellowship,

00:10:30.576 --> 00:10:32.835
Tshepo from South Africa said

00:10:32.859 --> 00:10:36.114
he wants to introduce this new way
of building into his country,

00:10:36.138 --> 00:10:39.383
so he plans to open
a private practice in Johannesburg.

00:10:39.985 --> 00:10:44.238
Zani wants to expand opportunities
for women to become engineers.

00:10:44.966 --> 00:10:47.102
Before joining the African Design Centre,

00:10:47.126 --> 00:10:48.858
she helped start, in Nairobi,

00:10:48.882 --> 00:10:53.573
an organization to bridge the gender gaps
for women in engineering fields,

00:10:53.597 --> 00:10:56.847
and she hopes to take
this movement across Africa,

00:10:56.871 --> 00:10:58.448
eventually the whole world.

00:10:59.574 --> 00:11:02.017
Moses, from South Sudan,

00:11:02.041 --> 00:11:04.216
the world's newest country,

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.232
wants to open the first polytechnic school

00:11:07.256 --> 00:11:12.280
that will teach people how to build
using local materials from his country.

00:11:13.746 --> 00:11:17.244
Moses had to be determined
to become an architect.

00:11:18.105 --> 00:11:23.417
The civil war in his country frequently
interrupted his architectural education.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:27.786
At the time he was applying
to join the African Design Centre,

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:32.501
we could hear gunshots going off
in the background of his interview call.

00:11:33.546 --> 00:11:36.872
But even in the middle of this civil war,

00:11:36.896 --> 00:11:38.731
Moses hangs on to this idea

00:11:38.755 --> 00:11:43.781
that architecture can be a way
to bridge communities back together.

00:11:44.727 --> 00:11:48.037
You have to be inspired
by this fellow's belief

00:11:48.061 --> 00:11:50.585
that great architecture
can make a difference

00:11:50.609 --> 00:11:53.419
on how the future of Africa is built.

00:11:54.514 --> 00:11:58.270
The unprecedented growth of Africa
cannot be ignored.

00:11:59.258 --> 00:12:02.881
Imagine Africa's future cities,

00:12:02.905 --> 00:12:05.387
but not as vast slums,

00:12:05.411 --> 00:12:07.292
but the most resilient

00:12:07.316 --> 00:12:10.697
and the most socially inclusive
places on earth.

00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:12.848
This is achievable.

00:12:13.909 --> 00:12:18.028
And we have the talent
to make it a reality.

00:12:18.052 --> 00:12:22.039
But the journey to ready that talent
for the task ahead,

00:12:22.063 --> 00:12:23.730
like my own journey,

00:12:23.754 --> 00:12:25.000
is far too long.

00:12:26.674 --> 00:12:31.107
For the next generation
of African creative leaders,

00:12:31.131 --> 00:12:34.566
we have to shorten
and streamline that journey.

00:12:35.106 --> 00:12:36.492
But most importantly --

00:12:36.516 --> 00:12:38.839
and I cannot stress this enough --

00:12:38.863 --> 00:12:41.141
we have to build their design confidence

00:12:41.165 --> 00:12:45.358
and empower them to develop solutions
that are truly African

00:12:45.382 --> 00:12:47.593
but globally inspiring.

00:12:48.082 --> 00:12:49.233
Thank you very much.

00:12:49.257 --> 00:12:56.257
