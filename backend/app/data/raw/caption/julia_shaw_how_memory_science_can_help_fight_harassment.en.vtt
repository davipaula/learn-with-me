00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:13.063
Me Too and Time's Up have highlighted

00:00:13.063 --> 00:00:17.556
that harassment and discrimination
are a shockingly common part

00:00:17.556 --> 00:00:19.625
of many people's lived reality,

00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:23.084
and that this reality
extends into the workplace.

00:00:23.274 --> 00:00:27.334
Whether in tech or finance,
sports or the service industry,

00:00:27.384 --> 00:00:31.301
every day we seem to hear another story
about an abuse of power

00:00:31.301 --> 00:00:34.316
or another grossly inappropriate
workplace behavior.

00:00:34.655 --> 00:00:36.642
People are furious.

00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:41.161
They're taking to Twitter and social media
to voice that this must change.

00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:44.315
But it's time to move beyond the hashtag.

00:00:44.365 --> 00:00:47.795
It's time for us to report
harassment and discrimination

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:50.085
to those who can fix this mess.

00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:52.695
And it's time for us
to talk about harassment

00:00:52.695 --> 00:00:54.394
in a more inclusive way:

00:00:54.524 --> 00:00:56.656
not just about sexual harassment,

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:58.854
but to encourage people to come forward

00:00:58.854 --> 00:01:02.384
about harassment and discrimination
based on other characteristics

00:01:02.384 --> 00:01:05.086
such as age, disability or ethnicity.

00:01:06.156 --> 00:01:08.504
Because only together can we fix

00:01:08.504 --> 00:01:11.523
the underlying causes
and consequences of harassment.

00:01:12.253 --> 00:01:15.436
You see, most of us will,
at some point in our lives,

00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:17.808
experience workplace
harassment or discrimination.

00:01:18.138 --> 00:01:21.454
Research shows that particularly
women, people of color

00:01:21.464 --> 00:01:26.557
and people who openly identify as LGBTQI
are likely to be targeted,

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:30.404
and for some people, this is a pervasive
and persistent part of their reality.

00:01:30.894 --> 00:01:32.956
And for most of these people -

00:01:32.956 --> 00:01:35.573
98 percent according to some studies -

00:01:35.573 --> 00:01:38.695
most of these people will never
speak up and tell their employer.

00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:44.274
Too often, harassment and discrimination
is a lonely and isolating experience,

00:01:44.514 --> 00:01:47.224
but we need to help people
out from under their desks.

00:01:47.434 --> 00:01:50.074
We need to empower people to have a voice.

00:01:51.704 --> 00:01:54.305
The reasonable first question
that everybody asks

00:01:54.305 --> 00:01:57.014
once they've been harassed
is, "What do I do now?"

00:01:57.284 --> 00:01:59.532
And this is what I want to help you with.

00:02:00.342 --> 00:02:05.076
Navigating the barriers to reporting
can be absolutely dizzying.

00:02:05.506 --> 00:02:07.531
How can we speak up in a society

00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:11.084
that too often discredits
or diminishes our experiences?

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:13.674
How can we speak up in a society

00:02:13.674 --> 00:02:17.855
that is likely to be
retributive towards us?

00:02:17.965 --> 00:02:22.654
How can we deal with the silencing
that goes on all around us?

00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:25.125
Making matters worse,

00:02:25.695 --> 00:02:30.504
often our memories are the only
evidence we have of what happened.

00:02:30.814 --> 00:02:32.480
Now, here's where I can come in.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.254
I'm a memory scientist,

00:02:34.254 --> 00:02:38.074
and I specialize in how we remember
important emotional events.

00:02:38.454 --> 00:02:42.226
I've particularly focused
on how the memory interview process

00:02:42.226 --> 00:02:47.114
can severely impact the evidentiary
quality of reports that we produce.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:51.694
A bad interview can lead you
to forget details or misremember them,

00:02:51.694 --> 00:02:55.464
while a good interview can forever
change your life for the better.

00:02:56.034 --> 00:03:01.324
After looking at lab reports
and working, studying this issue,

00:03:01.324 --> 00:03:03.915
both in the courtroom
and in research settings,

00:03:04.045 --> 00:03:08.444
I've dissected all the different things
that can go wrong with our memories

00:03:08.444 --> 00:03:10.504
that can really threaten your case.

00:03:10.614 --> 00:03:13.886
And now I'm turning my attention
to helping people tackle

00:03:13.886 --> 00:03:17.853
recording and reporting of workplace
harassment and discrimination.

00:03:18.453 --> 00:03:21.424
There's three things that I've learned
from my research on this

00:03:21.424 --> 00:03:23.384
that you can immediately apply

00:03:23.384 --> 00:03:26.113
if you've been harassed
or discriminated against at work.

00:03:26.493 --> 00:03:30.113
I want to help you
turn your memory into evidence -

00:03:30.453 --> 00:03:32.827
evidence that even
a memory skeptic like me

00:03:32.827 --> 00:03:34.844
is unlikely to find fault with.

00:03:35.944 --> 00:03:38.495
First of all, James Comey had it right.

00:03:38.775 --> 00:03:42.286
The former head of the FBI
used to sit in his car,

00:03:42.286 --> 00:03:44.754
lock himself in after meetings
with the president

00:03:44.754 --> 00:03:48.409
and write down absolutely everything
he could remember about what happened.

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:53.155
The now-famous recordings
proved to be quite useful later on.

00:03:53.585 --> 00:03:55.015
Be like Comey.

00:03:55.325 --> 00:03:58.265
Now, you don't need to lock yourself
into your car to do this,

00:03:58.265 --> 00:04:00.744
but please, immediately
after something happens,

00:04:00.744 --> 00:04:03.454
I want you to contemporaneously
record what happened.

00:04:03.804 --> 00:04:06.214
And do this before talking
to anyone else about it.

00:04:06.294 --> 00:04:08.212
Because as soon as your share your story

00:04:08.212 --> 00:04:10.804
with friends or family
or colleagues or therapists,

00:04:10.814 --> 00:04:14.124
you have the potential to distort
or change your memory of the event.

00:04:14.644 --> 00:04:18.643
Uncontaminated, contemporaneous
evidence is worth gold.

00:04:19.203 --> 00:04:22.213
Second: the type of evidence matters.

00:04:22.613 --> 00:04:25.185
Sure, you can do a handwritten
note of what happens,

00:04:25.185 --> 00:04:27.271
but how do you prove when you wrote it?

00:04:27.561 --> 00:04:30.281
Instead, pull out
your computer or smartphone

00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:32.744
and make a note that's time-stamped,

00:04:32.744 --> 00:04:35.546
where you can prove
this was recorded at this time.

00:04:36.006 --> 00:04:39.194
Contemporaneous,
time-stamped evidence is better.

00:04:41.964 --> 00:04:46.757
Finally, make sure what you're writing
down is actually relevant.

00:04:47.177 --> 00:04:51.304
Too often, we see that people
bring out Facebook messages,

00:04:51.304 --> 00:04:53.505
they bring out time-stamped
pieces of evidence,

00:04:53.505 --> 00:04:55.605
but sure, they're
not particularly relevant,

00:04:55.605 --> 00:04:57.445
they're not particularly useful.

00:04:57.445 --> 00:05:01.245
It's easy to write an emotional,
unstructured account of what happened -

00:05:01.245 --> 00:05:04.784
understandable because
it's an emotional experience -

00:05:04.784 --> 00:05:07.855
but those might not actually be
the details that matter later on

00:05:07.855 --> 00:05:09.046
for an investigation.

00:05:09.816 --> 00:05:11.309
Write down this list.

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:15.770
I want you to keep track of this
and simply fill in the blanks.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.894
First of all, what happened?

00:05:18.894 --> 00:05:20.584
In as much detail as possible,

00:05:20.584 --> 00:05:22.184
describe the situation,

00:05:22.184 --> 00:05:24.746
and do it on the day it happened
if at all possible.

00:05:24.966 --> 00:05:26.392
Second, who was there?

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:27.764
Were there any witnesses?

00:05:27.764 --> 00:05:29.875
This becomes crucial potentially later on.

00:05:30.305 --> 00:05:32.575
What exact time and date did this happen?

00:05:32.885 --> 00:05:35.133
What location? Where did this happen?

00:05:35.133 --> 00:05:37.494
Who did you tell after the event?

00:05:37.494 --> 00:05:40.364
How did it make you feel
during and after it happened?

00:05:40.364 --> 00:05:45.130
And is there any other evidence
such as WhatsApps, photos or emails

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.994
that might lend
more credibility to your case.

00:05:48.684 --> 00:05:52.365
These are all details that are incredibly
easy to record contemporaneously

00:05:52.575 --> 00:05:54.835
but are also incredibly easy
to forget later on.

00:05:55.495 --> 00:05:59.446
Humans, according to research,
often overestimate their ability

00:05:59.446 --> 00:06:01.845
to remember important
emotional details later on.

00:06:02.185 --> 00:06:04.186
Assume that you're going to forget.

00:06:04.546 --> 00:06:06.755
Assume you have to write it down.

00:06:08.495 --> 00:06:11.539
Now, these three pieces of advice
are a good start,

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.965
but of course they don't overcome
a lot of the other barriers to reporting.

00:06:16.225 --> 00:06:19.253
According to the Equality
and Human Rights Commission,

00:06:19.253 --> 00:06:21.345
which published a report in 2018,

00:06:21.585 --> 00:06:25.155
there's one key recommendation
to overcome some of the other fears

00:06:25.305 --> 00:06:29.415
often associated with reporting
these kinds of incidents to your employer.

00:06:29.925 --> 00:06:31.955
One piece of advice that they made?

00:06:32.445 --> 00:06:35.244
Have an online, anonymous reporting tool.

00:06:35.444 --> 00:06:37.185
Only that way, they say,

00:06:37.185 --> 00:06:40.671
can you truly overcome many
of the fears associated with reporting.

00:06:41.231 --> 00:06:42.665
Now, in line with this,

00:06:42.665 --> 00:06:45.525
and informed by what
was happening all around me

00:06:45.915 --> 00:06:48.895
and taking and applying
the memory science,

00:06:48.895 --> 00:06:51.065
the science I had been doing
for many years,

00:06:51.725 --> 00:06:53.584
I sat down with a number of people

00:06:53.704 --> 00:06:56.964
and we together created TalkToSpot.com.

00:06:57.544 --> 00:07:00.511
Spot is an online,
anonymous reporting tool

00:07:00.511 --> 00:07:04.011
that helps you record and report
workplace harassment and discrimination.

00:07:04.231 --> 00:07:05.983
It allows you to do it anonymously,

00:07:05.983 --> 00:07:07.594
it allows you to do it for free,

00:07:07.594 --> 00:07:09.485
and it's completely evidence-based.

00:07:09.555 --> 00:07:11.255
You don't have to talk to a person,

00:07:11.255 --> 00:07:12.699
there's no fear of judgment,

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:15.735
and you can do it
whenever and wherever you need.

00:07:17.495 --> 00:07:22.945
Now you have the power to walk through
an evidence-based memory interview.

00:07:23.325 --> 00:07:25.385
Now, this is called a cognitive interview.

00:07:25.385 --> 00:07:29.485
This is the same technique that police use
when they're doing their job properly.

00:07:29.485 --> 00:07:31.584
So best-case scenarios:

00:07:31.764 --> 00:07:34.604
people who are being asked
about important emotional events

00:07:34.604 --> 00:07:37.555
are being asked in line
with the cognitive interview.

00:07:37.825 --> 00:07:41.566
Now, this walks you through
all the relevant information

00:07:41.566 --> 00:07:44.525
so that at the end,
after you've talked to the bot -

00:07:44.525 --> 00:07:47.651
which is an automatic messaging system -

00:07:48.071 --> 00:07:49.614
after you've talked to the bot,

00:07:49.614 --> 00:07:52.814
it generates a PDF record
that's time-stamped and securely signed

00:07:52.814 --> 00:07:56.855
that you can keep for yourself as evidence
in case you want to share it later,

00:07:56.855 --> 00:07:59.693
or you can submit it
to your employer right away.

00:08:00.333 --> 00:08:01.914
And in line with recommendations,

00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:04.576
you can submit it
to your employer anonymously.

00:08:05.486 --> 00:08:10.104
But a reporting tool is only as useful
as the audience that's listening.

00:08:10.244 --> 00:08:12.836
So if your employer
is truly committed to change,

00:08:13.246 --> 00:08:16.506
we've decided to also offer them
the tool to respond.

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:21.383
So if organizations work with us
and are truly committed to doing something

00:08:21.383 --> 00:08:23.773
about workplace harassment
and discrimination,

00:08:23.773 --> 00:08:28.684
they're also able to respond to you
even if you've chosen to stay anonymous.

00:08:28.974 --> 00:08:32.325
We think it's important that you can work
together with your employer

00:08:32.325 --> 00:08:34.224
to tackle this issue.

00:08:35.394 --> 00:08:39.672
We think that everybody wins
when we bring light into this dark issue.

00:08:39.872 --> 00:08:42.475
Whether it happens to you
or to someone you know,

00:08:42.475 --> 00:08:44.461
recording and reporting what happened

00:08:44.461 --> 00:08:48.281
can really improve
how we talk about these issues.

00:08:48.551 --> 00:08:50.014
And if you're an organization,

00:08:50.014 --> 00:08:52.755
this is a call to give
your employees access

00:08:52.755 --> 00:08:55.486
to better and more effective
reporting mechanisms.

00:08:55.686 --> 00:09:00.735
We know that the current methods
that are used in most organizations

00:09:00.845 --> 00:09:02.514
don't work effectively.

00:09:03.004 --> 00:09:07.096
It's time to change that if you're
committed to inclusion and diversity.

00:09:10.006 --> 00:09:13.025
It's time for us
to celebrate our diversity.

00:09:13.505 --> 00:09:16.578
It's time for us to give a voice

00:09:16.578 --> 00:09:19.746
to those who have for too long
been denied one.

00:09:20.176 --> 00:09:23.154
It's time for us to celebrate
those who come forward,

00:09:23.234 --> 00:09:25.525
even if they feel
they need to stay anonymous -

00:09:25.525 --> 00:09:27.526
to stay masked to do so.

00:09:27.846 --> 00:09:30.564
It's time for a reporting revolution.

00:09:31.094 --> 00:09:32.326
Thank you.

00:09:32.326 --> 00:09:33.795
(Applause)
