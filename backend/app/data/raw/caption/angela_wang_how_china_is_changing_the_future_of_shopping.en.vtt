00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.520
This is my nephew,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.576
Yuan Yuan.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.096
He's five years old,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.400
super adorable.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.336
I asked him the other day,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.720
"What would you like
for your birthday this year?"

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.440
He said, "I want to have
a one-way mirror Spider-Man mask."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.776
I had absolutely no idea
what he was talking about,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.776
so I said, "Wow, that's really cool,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.372
but how are you going to get it?"

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.016
He told me, without a blink of his eyes,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.119
"I'm going to tell my mom
and make a wish before I go to bed.

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:46.720
My mom will go to shake her mobile phone.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.680
The next morning, the delivery uncle
will give it to me when I wake up."

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.296
I was about to tease him,

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.096
but suddenly I realized

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.456
he was simply telling me the truth,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.616
the truth of what shopping
looks like for this generation.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.256
If you think of it,
for a child like Yuan Yuan,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.576
shopping is a very different idea

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.496
compared to what
my generation had in mind.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.776
Shopping is always done on mobile,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.879
and payment is all virtual.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.480
A huge shopping revolution
is happening in China right now.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.976
Shopping behaviors,
and also technology platforms,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.856
have evolved differently
than elsewhere in the world.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.776
For instance, e-commerce
in China is soaring.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.616
It's been growing at twice the speed
of the United States

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.280
and a lot of the growth
is coming from mobile.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.696
Every month, 500 million consumers

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.816
are buying on mobile phones,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.576
and to put that into context,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.816
that is a total population
of the United States,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.280
UK and Germany combined.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.896
But it is not just about
the scale of the e-commerce,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.496
it is the speed of adoption
and the aggregation of the ecosystems.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.016
It took China less than five years
to become a country of mobile commerce,

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.176
and that is largely because
of the two technology platforms,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.720
Alibaba and Tencent.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.696
They own 90 percent of the e-commerce --

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.376
pretty much the whole market --

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.735
85 percent of social media,

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.896
85 percent of internet payment.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.456
And they also own large volumes
of digital content, video, online movie,

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.640
literature, travel information, gaming.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.456
When this huge base of mobile shoppers

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.936
meets with aggregated ecosystems,

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.816
chemical reactions happen.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.456
Today, China is like a huge laboratory

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.296
generating all sorts of experiments.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.776
You should come to China,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.400
because here you will get
a glimpse into the future.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.760
One of the trends I have seen
concerns the spontaneity of shopping.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.496
Five years ago, in a fashion study,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.976
we found that on average,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.936
a Chinese consumer would be buying
five to eight pairs of shoes.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.336
This number tripled
to reach about 25 pairs of shoes a year.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.920
Who would need so many pairs of shoes?

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.656
So I asked them,
"What are the reasons you buy?"

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.336
They told me a list of inspirations:

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.016
blogs, celebrity news,
fashion information.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.496
But really, for many of them,
there was no particular reason to buy.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.016
They were just browsing
on their mobile site

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.160
and then buying whatever they saw.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.816
We have observed the same level
of spontaneity in everything,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.520
from grocery shopping
to buying insurance products.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.816
But it is not very difficult
to understand if you think about it.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.576
A lot of the Chinese consumers
are still very new

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.816
in their middle-class
or upper-middle-class lifestyles,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.816
with a strong desire
to buy everything new,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.896
new products, new services.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.616
And with this integrated ecosystem,

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.120
it is so easy for them to buy,
one click after another.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.016
However, this new shopping behavior
is creating a lot of challenges

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.776
for those once-dominant businesses.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.656
The owner of a fashion company
told me that he's so frustrated

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.800
because his customers keep complaining
that his products are not new enough.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.120
Well, for a fashion company,
really bad comment.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.976
And he already increased the number
of products in each collection.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.200
It doesn't seem to work.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.216
So I told him there's something
more important than that.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.696
You've got to give your consumer
exactly what they want

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.960
when they still want it.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.256
And he can learn something
from the online apparel players in China.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.536
These companies, they collect
real consumer feedback

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.056
from mobile sites, from social media,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.376
and then their designers
will translate this information

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.096
into product ideas,

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.600
and then send them
to microstudios for production.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.976
These microstudios are really key
in this overall ecosystem,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.176
because they take small orders,

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.376
30 garments at a time,

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.600
and they can also make
partially customized pieces.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.976
The fact that all these production designs

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.456
are done locally,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.016
the whole process, from transporting
to product on shelf or online

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.616
sometimes takes only three to four days.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.336
That is super fast,

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.976
and that is highly responsive
to what is in and hot on the market.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.296
And that is giving enormous headaches
to traditional retailers

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.160
who are only thinking
about a few collections a year.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.680
Then there's a consumer's need
for ultraconvenience.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.456
A couple of months ago,
I was shopping with a friend in Tokyo.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.736
We were in the store,

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.576
and there were three to four people
standing in front of us

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.056
at the checkout counter.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.616
Pretty normal, right?

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.416
But both of us dropped our selection

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.640
and walked away.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.680
This is how impatient we have become.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.416
Delivering ultraconvenience
is not just something nice to have.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.520
It is crucial to make sure
your consumer actually buys.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.536
And in China, we have learned

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.696
that convenience is really the glue
that will make online shopping

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.696
a behavior and a habit that sticks.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.296
It is sometimes more effective
than a loyalty program alone.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.016
Take Hema.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.080
It's a retail grocery concept
developed by Alibaba.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.576
They deliver a full basket of products

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.856
from 4,000 SKUs to your doorstep

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.736
within 30 minutes.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.856
What is amazing is that they deliver
literally everything:

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.096
fruits, vegetables, of course.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.456
They also deliver live fish

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.800
and also live Alaska king crab.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.216
Like my friend once told me,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.936
"It's really my dream coming true.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.896
Finally, I can impress my mother-in-law

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.896
when she comes to visit me
for dinner unexpectedly."

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.216
(Laughter)

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.896
Well, companies
like Amazon and FreshDirect

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.816
are also experimenting in the same field.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.416
The fact that Hema
is part of the Alibaba ecosystem

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.960
makes it faster and also
a bit easier to implement.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.656
For an online grocery player,

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.496
it is very difficult, very costly,

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.296
to deliver a full basket quickly,

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.936
but for Hema, it's got a mobile app,

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.616
it's got mobile payment,

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:35.336
and also it's built 20 physical stores
in high-density areas in Shanghai.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.256
These stores are built
to ensure the freshness of the product --

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.176
they actually have
fish tanks in the store --

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.480
and also to give locations
that will enable high-speed delivery.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.936
I know the question you have on your mind.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.216
Are they making money?

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.576
Yes, they are making money.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.856
They are breaking even,

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.456
and what is also amazing
is that the sales revenue per store

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.496
is three to four times higher
than the traditional grocery store,

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.160
and half of the revenue orders
are coming from mobile.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.896
This is really proof that a consumer,

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.496
if you give them ultraconvenience
that really works in grocery shopping,

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.376
they're going to switch
their shopping behaviors online,

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.600
like, in no time.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.576
So ultraconvenience and spontaneity,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.456
that's not the full story.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.616
The other trend I have seen in China

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.880
is social shopping.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.056
If you think of social shopping
elsewhere in the world,

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.520
it is a linear process.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.696
You pick up something on Facebook,

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.336
watch it, and you switch to Amazon

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.056
or brand.com to complete
the shopping journey.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.736
Clean and simple.

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.856
But in China it is a very different thing.

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.616
On average, a consumer would spend
one hour on their mobile phone shopping.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.296
That's three times higher
than the United States.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.256
Where does the stickiness come from?

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.680
What are they actually doing
on this tiny little screen?

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.576
So let me take you
on a mobile shopping journey

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.520
that I usually would be experiencing.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.960
11pm, yes, that's usually when I shop.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.416
I was having a chat in a WeChat
chatroom with my friends.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.536
One of them took out a pack of snack

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.840
and posted the product link
in that chatroom.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.016
I hate it, because usually
I would just click that link

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.656
and then land on the product page.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.936
Lots of information, very colorful,

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.376
mind-blowing.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.136
Watched it and then
a shop assistant came online

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.216
and asked me, "How can I
help you tonight?"

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.416
Of course I bought that pack of snack.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.496
What is more beautiful is I know
that the next day, around noontime,

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.376
that pack of snack
will be delivered to my office.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.016
I can eat it and share it
with my colleagues

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.920
and the cost of delivery,
maximum one dollar.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.176
Just when I was about to leave
that shopping site,

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.056
another screen popped up.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.736
This time it is the livestreaming
of a grassroots celebrity

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.016
teaching me how to wear
a new color of lipstick.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.136
I watched for 30 seconds --
very easy to understand --

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.216
and also there is
a shopping link right next to it,

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.880
clicked it, bought it in a few seconds.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.096
Back to the chatroom.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.976
The gossiping is still going on.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.856
Another friend of mine posted the QR code

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.536
of another pack of snack.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.080
Clicked it, bought it.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.656
So the whole experience

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:26.456
is like you're exploring
in an amusement park.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.096
It is chaotic, it is fun

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.520
and it's even a little bit addictive.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.936
This is what's happening
when you have this integrated ecosystem.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.656
Shopping is embedded in social,

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:44.376
and social is evolving
into a multidimensional experience.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.096
The integration of ecosystems
reaches a whole new level.

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.440
So does its dominance
in all aspects of our life.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:56.336
And of course, there are huge
commercial opportunities behind it.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.176
A Chinese snack company, Three Squirrels,

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.976
built a half-a-billion-dollar business
in just three years

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.816
by investing in 300 to 500 shop assistants

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.976
who are going to be online
to provide services 24/7.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.016
In the social media environment,

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.976
they are like your neighborhood friends.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.696
Even when you are not buying stuff,

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.120
they will be happy to just tell you
a few jokes and make you happy.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.096
In this integrated ecosystem,

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.576
social media can really redefine
the relationship between brand,

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.600
retailer and consumer.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.896
These are only fragments
of the massive changes

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.616
I have seen in China.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.616
In this huge laboratory,

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.320
a lot of experiments
are generated every single day.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.536
The ecosystems are reforming,

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.736
supply chain distribution,
marketing, product innovation,

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:50.976
everything.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.256
Consumers are getting the power
to decide what they want to buy,

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.576
when they want to buy it,

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.616
how they want to buy it,
how they want to social.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.056
It is now back to business
leaders of the world

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.416
to really open their eyes,
see what's happening in China,

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.440
think about it and take actions.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.536
Thank you.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.360
(Applause)

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.240
Massimo Portincaso: Angela, 
what you shared with us

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.380
is truly impressive and almost incredible,

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:29.656
but I think many in the audience
had the same question that I had,

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.896
which is:

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.256
Is this kind of impulsive consumption

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:38.496
both economically and environmentally
sustainable over the longer term?

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.256
And what is the total price to be paid

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.976
for such an automized
and ultraconvenient retail experience?

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.896
Angela Wang: Yeah.
One thing we have to keep in mind

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.640
is really, we are at the very beginning
of a huge transformation.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.336
So with this trading up
needs of the consumer,

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.496
together with the evolution
of the ecosystem,

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.296
there are a lot of opportunities
and also challenges.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.896
So I've seen some early signs

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.776
that the ecosystems
are shifting their focus

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.376
to pay attention
to solve these challenges.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.656
For example, paying more
consideration to sustainability

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.616
alongside just about speed,

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.496
and also quality over quantity.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.456
But there are really
no simple answers to these questions.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.096
That is exactly why
I'm here to tell everyone

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:31.000
that we need to watch it, study it,
and play a part in this evolution.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.216
MP: Thank you very much.

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.456
AW: Thank you.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.120
(Applause)
