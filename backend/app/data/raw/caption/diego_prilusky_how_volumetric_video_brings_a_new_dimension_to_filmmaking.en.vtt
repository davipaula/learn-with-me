00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:14.541
I love making movies.

00:00:17.174 --> 00:00:21.373
Motion pictures have been in existence
for more than a hundred years.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.029
Filmmaking hasn't changed
for the dimensional mindset.

00:00:27.092 --> 00:00:31.430
Placing the camera in a scene
and pressing "record" hasn't changed.

00:00:31.454 --> 00:00:34.699
Filmmaking is still a frontal experience,

00:00:34.723 --> 00:00:37.859
and creating the film has the possibility

00:00:37.883 --> 00:00:42.062
to follow the same direction
of the content creation.

00:00:42.086 --> 00:00:45.167
We still stand in front of a flat image,

00:00:45.191 --> 00:00:46.617
watching the fiction.

00:00:48.324 --> 00:00:49.761
There's nothing wrong with it.

00:00:49.785 --> 00:00:52.634
I love watching movies
and going to the theaters.

00:00:52.658 --> 00:00:55.369
The experiences can be
such emotional experiences.

00:00:55.708 --> 00:00:59.135
The art and craft of emotional
experiences within a frame

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.054
can be so strong
to drive a stronger emotion.

00:01:03.178 --> 00:01:05.534
The question we're asking is,

00:01:05.558 --> 00:01:09.511
How the experience of motion pictures
can exist beyond the flat screen.

00:01:10.544 --> 00:01:12.407
How can we start creating content

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:15.264
for the next generation
of content experiences?

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.248
Traditionally, when we imagine a scene,

00:01:19.272 --> 00:01:21.446
we look at the frame and the composition.

00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:25.428
We have to think about how we create
depth and parallax

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:29.857
using foreground, background elements
as the camera moves.

00:01:30.354 --> 00:01:33.965
With the technology today
and devices of VR glasses,

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:36.785
AR glasses, smart devices,

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:40.700
allowing three-dimensional
and full navigation in space,

00:01:40.724 --> 00:01:43.220
we have the possibility
to enable audiences

00:01:43.244 --> 00:01:45.954
to experience content
from multiple perspectives.

00:01:46.515 --> 00:01:50.305
What we have to think about
is how we take this technology,

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:51.897
all the capabilities,

00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:57.301
and enable the experience
to move farther away inside the scene.

00:01:57.325 --> 00:02:01.119
Now we're not talking about video games
or computer-generated actors,

00:02:01.143 --> 00:02:03.912
which look tremendously realistic.

00:02:04.485 --> 00:02:07.365
We're talking about real actors
and real performance,

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:08.674
performing onstage.

00:02:10.127 --> 00:02:14.104
We have to start thinking
how we capture the actors

00:02:14.128 --> 00:02:16.380
and how we capture the real scene

00:02:16.404 --> 00:02:18.350
in order to immerse inside.

00:02:18.374 --> 00:02:21.675
Now, we're familiar
with the 360-degree video,

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:24.215
where you place a camera inside the scene

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.993
and you can create this beautiful
panoramic image all around you,

00:02:28.017 --> 00:02:29.557
but from the same aspect,

00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:31.770
filmmaking is still frontal.

00:02:32.472 --> 00:02:35.259
In order to emerge fully inside the scene,

00:02:35.283 --> 00:02:39.327
we will need to capture the light
from all the possible directions.

00:02:39.351 --> 00:02:44.057
We will have to surround the scene
with an enormous amount of sensors,

00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:47.908
with all possible capabilities
to capture the light

00:02:47.932 --> 00:02:50.464
and enable us to emerge
inside afterwards again.

00:02:51.908 --> 00:02:53.226
Now, in this setup,

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.774
there's no more foreground or background

00:02:55.798 --> 00:02:57.490
or a camera placed in space

00:02:57.514 --> 00:03:01.031
but hundreds of sensors
capturing the light

00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:03.911
and capturing the motion
from all the possible directions.

00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:07.099
With the new technological advancements,

00:03:07.123 --> 00:03:09.687
we can start looking at 3D photography,

00:03:09.711 --> 00:03:12.558
capturing the light
from multiple perspectives,

00:03:12.582 --> 00:03:14.502
enabling us to reconstruct the object.

00:03:15.534 --> 00:03:17.716
This is like photography in 3D space.

00:03:18.457 --> 00:03:21.132
Now, with these
technological advancements,

00:03:21.156 --> 00:03:24.553
we can record video
not just as a flat image

00:03:24.577 --> 00:03:26.069
but as a volume.

00:03:26.093 --> 00:03:28.989
This is what we call "volumetric video,"

00:03:29.013 --> 00:03:32.608
and it has the capability
to record every action of the scene

00:03:32.632 --> 00:03:34.433
as a full three-dimensional volume.

00:03:35.138 --> 00:03:37.282
Now, what is a voxel?

00:03:38.193 --> 00:03:41.296
A voxel is like a three-dimensional pixel,

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.616
but instead of being a flat image square,
staying light and colored,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.901
it's like a three-dimensional
cube in space,

00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:52.328
with x, y, and z positions.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.810
This enables us to create
a full capture of the scene

00:03:56.834 --> 00:03:58.142
from any perspective.

00:03:58.976 --> 00:04:03.889
Now this renders
a fully light-immersive scene

00:04:03.913 --> 00:04:05.985
from multiple perspectives.

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:10.929
This capability requires an insane amount
of information to be processed.

00:04:10.953 --> 00:04:15.866
We will have to capture the light
from an enormous amount of cameras

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.405
to create this information.

00:04:18.573 --> 00:04:21.752
Now, in order to do such a thing,

00:04:21.776 --> 00:04:27.132
we would need a setup that would host
a numerous amount of cameras

00:04:28.051 --> 00:04:30.044
installed in a stage

00:04:30.068 --> 00:04:35.242
and a stage big enough in order to fit
a full cinematic experience.

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:40.733
Now that sounds like a crazy idea,
but that's exactly what we did.

00:04:41.583 --> 00:04:43.011
For the last three years,

00:04:43.035 --> 00:04:47.432
we have been building
a huge volumetric camera chamber.

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:51.210
It's 10,000 square feet of a stage,

00:04:51.234 --> 00:04:54.424
enabling to capture the action
from any location.

00:04:55.184 --> 00:04:57.266
We have deployed hundreds of cameras,

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.806
sending a tremendous amount of information

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.734
to a huge data center
powered by Intel supercomputers.

00:05:04.695 --> 00:05:08.059
The ability to have this 10,000 feet

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:11.445
enables us to fit any kind of action,

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:12.921
any kind of performance.

00:05:13.443 --> 00:05:16.008
It is the size of an average
Broadway stage.

00:05:17.397 --> 00:05:19.455
We call it Intel Studios,

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.476
and it's the largest volumetric
stage in the world,

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.054
with the objective
of enabling and exploring

00:05:26.078 --> 00:05:29.121
the next generation
of this immersive media filmmaking.

00:05:30.498 --> 00:05:32.855
Now, to test these ideas,

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:38.855
we were thinking about what we can do
as the first scene to try it out.

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:41.472
So we chose the Western scene.

00:05:42.354 --> 00:05:46.929
We brought horses, set designers, dirt,

00:05:46.953 --> 00:05:50.648
everything needed to create
the full scene of a Western.

00:05:50.672 --> 00:05:53.584
But this time, there was no camera inside.

00:05:54.306 --> 00:05:58.219
There was nothing really moving
besides all the cameras

00:05:58.243 --> 00:06:00.111
installed outside.

00:06:00.423 --> 00:06:03.265
The challenge
of the actors was tremendous.

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:09.049
They have to perform a flawless action
visible from all the directions.

00:06:09.653 --> 00:06:14.170
There's no possibility to hide a punch
or not show the action.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.962
Everything is captured
and everything is seen.

00:06:17.703 --> 00:06:21.401
The output of the capture --

00:06:21.425 --> 00:06:22.885
this is our future capture --

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:25.736
opened our eyes for
the immense capabilities.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.721
It was like a full 3D scan
of the entire scene.

00:06:29.745 --> 00:06:33.483
We were able to move around
and travel in the space.

00:06:33.507 --> 00:06:34.669
The thing about this,

00:06:34.693 --> 00:06:38.433
it's not anymore about perceiving
the light emitted from a screen

00:06:38.457 --> 00:06:41.062
but now traveling inside the light,

00:06:41.086 --> 00:06:42.785
traveling inside the scene.

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:45.722
This obviously opens possibilities
for an enormous amount

00:06:45.746 --> 00:06:49.404
of storytelling
and methodologies of creation.

00:06:49.799 --> 00:06:53.178
This is the possibilities
of your personal narrative,

00:06:53.202 --> 00:06:56.030
the possibility of creating
your own story inside,

00:06:56.054 --> 00:06:57.711
or maybe following other stories.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.962
Let's take a look
at one of the last renders and see.

00:07:01.986 --> 00:07:03.058
(Music)

00:07:03.082 --> 00:07:06.145
What you're seeing here
is full volumetric video,

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:08.391
and there's no physical
camera in the scene.

00:07:08.415 --> 00:07:10.328
(Music)

00:07:10.352 --> 00:07:11.891
We have the full control

00:07:11.915 --> 00:07:13.490
(Music, sounds of combat)

00:07:13.514 --> 00:07:15.312
of space and time.

00:07:15.336 --> 00:07:22.336
(Music, sounds of combat)

00:07:26.358 --> 00:07:29.169
Now, again, no physical camera was here.

00:07:29.193 --> 00:07:31.867
Everything was captured surrounding.

00:07:31.891 --> 00:07:34.042
Now, this is very nice,

00:07:34.066 --> 00:07:38.301
but what if we wanted to see the scene,
maybe, from the eyes of the horse?

00:07:38.676 --> 00:07:41.042
Well, we can do that as well.

00:07:41.066 --> 00:07:42.462
(Horse galloping)

00:07:42.486 --> 00:07:45.755
So what you're seeing right now
is the same action,

00:07:45.779 --> 00:07:49.200
but this time, we're watching
exactly from the eyes of the horse.

00:07:49.224 --> 00:07:52.882
The possibilities are, well, unlimited.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.361
(Applause)

00:07:54.385 --> 00:07:55.544
Thank you.

00:07:55.568 --> 00:07:58.975
(Applause)

00:07:58.999 --> 00:08:03.086
So this is all great
for creators and storytellers.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.122
It really opens a huge canvas

00:08:05.146 --> 00:08:08.102
for a different type
of storytelling and moviemaking.

00:08:08.126 --> 00:08:09.621
But what about the audience?

00:08:09.645 --> 00:08:12.221
How can the audience
experience this differently?

00:08:12.838 --> 00:08:14.726
In order to [create] our explorations,

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.566
we partnered with Paramount Pictures

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:20.641
in order to explore immersive media
in a Hollywood movie production.

00:08:21.109 --> 00:08:23.253
Together with the director Randal Kleiser,

00:08:23.277 --> 00:08:28.085
we reimagined the iconic movie of 1978,

00:08:28.109 --> 00:08:29.460
"Grease."

00:08:29.484 --> 00:08:31.862
Some of you know it, some of you don't.

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:34.982
A 40-year-old movie, amazing experience.

00:08:35.454 --> 00:08:41.890
And our goal was really to look at how 
we can take this iconic action and dance

00:08:41.914 --> 00:08:44.589
and bring it deeper into the experience,

00:08:44.613 --> 00:08:46.606
bring it deeper into the audience.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.216
Imagine that you can
not just watch the movie

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.622
but get inside it
and dance with the actors

00:08:52.646 --> 00:08:54.281
and dance with the performance.

00:08:54.305 --> 00:09:00.008
Now we're breaking, really,
the traditional 2D mindset of thinking,

00:09:00.032 --> 00:09:03.305
and bringing a much richer
possibility of moviemaking

00:09:03.329 --> 00:09:04.479
and content creation.

00:09:05.259 --> 00:09:07.114
But why watch it on the screen?

00:09:08.002 --> 00:09:10.416
Let's try to bring these actors
here on the stage.

00:09:17.165 --> 00:09:19.064
So they're not going to really come --

00:09:19.088 --> 00:09:20.362
I'm going to use an iPad.

00:09:20.386 --> 00:09:21.387
(Laughter)

00:09:21.411 --> 00:09:22.562
Sorry.

00:09:22.586 --> 00:09:27.252
I'm going to use an iPad
in order to bring in augmented reality.

00:09:27.276 --> 00:09:32.109
Now, obviously, these devices
have their own limitations

00:09:33.113 --> 00:09:35.118
in terms of the data-computing process,

00:09:35.142 --> 00:09:37.482
so we have to reduce
the amount of resolution.

00:09:39.016 --> 00:09:42.913
So what I'm doing now,
I'm placing here a marker,

00:09:42.937 --> 00:09:47.777
so I'll be able to position exactly
where I want everyone to appear.

00:09:54.608 --> 00:09:55.759
OK.

00:09:55.783 --> 00:09:57.108
I think we have them here.

00:09:57.907 --> 00:10:04.304
(Applause)

00:10:04.328 --> 00:10:05.637
John Travolta, or --

00:10:05.661 --> 00:10:06.662
(Laughter)

00:10:06.686 --> 00:10:07.836
a version of him.

00:10:08.776 --> 00:10:10.137
Let's take a look.

00:10:10.463 --> 00:10:11.614
(Video) Female: Hey.

00:10:11.638 --> 00:10:13.217
Male: And that is how it's done.

00:10:13.241 --> 00:10:14.447
Female: Your turn.

00:10:14.471 --> 00:10:16.031
Male: Hey, guys! Check this out.

00:10:16.055 --> 00:10:18.985
(Song: "You're the one that I want")

00:10:19.366 --> 00:10:20.539
Danny: Sandy!

00:10:20.844 --> 00:10:23.181
Sandy: Tell me about it, stud.

00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:27.951
(Singing) I got chills.
They're multiplying

00:10:28.554 --> 00:10:32.940
And I'm losing control

00:10:32.964 --> 00:10:37.228
'Cause the power you're supplying

00:10:37.252 --> 00:10:39.261
It's electrifying!

00:10:39.261 --> 00:10:40.261
(Video ends)

00:10:40.261 --> 00:10:45.857
(Applause and cheers)

00:10:45.881 --> 00:10:47.214
Diego Prilusky: Thank you.

00:10:47.238 --> 00:10:49.485
(Applause and cheers)

00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:50.801
So as you can see,

00:10:52.039 --> 00:10:55.961
we can watch and experience content
in the traditional way

00:10:55.985 --> 00:10:57.189
or in an immersive way.

00:10:58.014 --> 00:10:59.926
Really, the possibilities are open.

00:11:00.705 --> 00:11:04.157
We're not trying to change
or replace movies.

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.348
We're enhancing them.

00:11:06.372 --> 00:11:11.189
The technologies enable new possibilities
to start thinking beyond the flat screen.

00:11:12.219 --> 00:11:16.094
We're in immersive and really
exciting times in filmmaking.

00:11:16.465 --> 00:11:18.950
We're at the threshold of a new era.

00:11:18.974 --> 00:11:22.122
We're opening the gates
for new possibilities

00:11:22.146 --> 00:11:23.899
of immersive storytelling,

00:11:25.122 --> 00:11:29.733
and exploration and defining
what immersive media filmmaking means.

00:11:30.868 --> 00:11:33.202
We're really just at the beginning,

00:11:33.226 --> 00:11:35.619
and we invite you all to join us.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.301
Thank you.

00:11:37.325 --> 00:11:42.436
