00:00:05.943 --> 00:00:10.763
In 1884, a patient’s luck seemed 
to go from bad to worse.

00:00:10.763 --> 00:00:14.268
This patient had a rapidly growing 
cancer in his neck,

00:00:14.268 --> 00:00:18.909
and then came down with an unrelated 
bacterial skin infection.

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:21.619
But soon, something unexpected happened:

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.670
as he recovered from the infection, 
the cancer also began to recede.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.531
When a physician named William Coley 
tracked the patient down 7 years later,

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.191
no visible signs of the cancer remained.

00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:37.162
Coley believed something remarkable 
was happening:

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:41.472
that the bacterial infection 
had stimulated the patient’s immune system

00:00:41.472 --> 00:00:43.710
to fight off the cancer.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.504
Coley’s fortunate discovery 
led him to pioneer

00:00:46.504 --> 00:00:51.417
the intentional injection of bacteria 
to successfully treat cancer.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:55.867
Over a century later, synthetic biologists
have found an even better way

00:00:55.867 --> 00:00:58.954
to use these once unlikely allies—

00:00:58.954 --> 00:01:04.040
by programming them to safely 
deliver drugs directly to tumors.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.670
Cancer occurs when normal functions 
of cells are altered,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.534
causing them to rapidly multiply 
and form growths called tumors.

00:01:12.534 --> 00:01:16.824
Treatments like radiation, chemotherapy, 
and immunotherapy

00:01:16.824 --> 00:01:20.459
attempt to kill malignant cells, 
but can affect the entire body

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:23.457
and disrupt healthy tissues 
in the process.

00:01:23.457 --> 00:01:26.077
However, some bacteria like E. coli

00:01:26.077 --> 00:01:31.528
have the unique advantage of being able 
to selectively grow inside tumors.

00:01:31.528 --> 00:01:35.478
In fact, the core of a tumor forms 
an ideal environment

00:01:35.478 --> 00:01:39.367
where they can safely multiply, 
hidden from immune cells.

00:01:39.367 --> 00:01:41.068
Instead of causing infection,

00:01:41.068 --> 00:01:45.077
bacteria can be reprogrammed 
to carry cancer-fighting drugs,

00:01:45.077 --> 00:01:49.847
acting as Trojan Horses 
that target the tumor from within.

00:01:49.847 --> 00:01:54.794
This idea of programming bacteria 
to sense and respond in novel ways

00:01:54.794 --> 00:01:59.514
is a major focus of a field called 
Synthetic Biology.

00:01:59.514 --> 00:02:01.984
But how can bacteria be programmed?

00:02:01.984 --> 00:02:05.083
The key lies in manipulating their DNA.

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:08.456
By inserting particular genetic sequences 
into bacteria,

00:02:08.456 --> 00:02:11.715
they can be instructed 
to synthesize different molecules,

00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:15.271
including those 
that disrupt cancer growth.

00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:18.332
They can also be made 
to behave in very specific ways

00:02:18.332 --> 00:02:20.866
with the help of biological circuits.

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:25.075
These program different behaviors 
depending on the presence, absence,

00:02:25.075 --> 00:02:27.811
or combination of certain factors.

00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:31.557
For example, tumors have low oxygen 
and pH levels

00:02:31.557 --> 00:02:34.630
and over-produce specific molecules.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.369
Synthetic biologists can program bacteria 
to sense those conditions,

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:44.012
and by doing so, respond to tumors 
while avoiding healthy tissue.

00:02:44.012 --> 00:02:46.377
One type of biological circuit,

00:02:46.377 --> 00:02:50.307
known as a synchronized lysis circuit, 
or SLC,

00:02:50.307 --> 00:02:53.079
allows bacteria 
to not only deliver medicine,

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.769
but to do so on a set schedule.

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.009
First, to avoid harming healthy tissue,

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:02.242
production of anti-cancer drugs 
begins as bacteria grow,

00:03:02.242 --> 00:03:05.324
which only happens 
within the tumor itself.

00:03:05.324 --> 00:03:07.671
Next, after they’ve produced the drugs,

00:03:07.671 --> 00:03:10.840
a kill-switch causes 
the bacteria to burst

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.000
when they reach a critical population 
threshold.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.497
This both releases the medicine 
and decreases the bacteria’s population.

00:03:18.497 --> 00:03:22.549
However, a certain percentage 
of the bacteria remain alive

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.537
to replenish the colony.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:28.518
Eventually their numbers grow large enough
to trigger the kill switch again,

00:03:28.518 --> 00:03:30.568
and the cycle continues.

00:03:30.568 --> 00:03:33.618
This circuit can be fine-tuned 
to deliver drugs

00:03:33.618 --> 00:03:37.858
on whatever periodic schedule
is best to fight the cancer.

00:03:37.858 --> 00:03:42.288
This approach has proven promising 
in scientific trials using mice.

00:03:42.288 --> 00:03:46.534
Not only were scientists able 
to successfully eliminate lymphoma tumors

00:03:46.534 --> 00:03:48.124
injected with bacteria,

00:03:48.124 --> 00:03:51.294
but the injection also stimulated 
the immune system,

00:03:51.294 --> 00:03:55.832
priming immune cells 
to identify and attack untreated lymphomas

00:03:55.832 --> 00:03:57.592
elsewhere in the mouse.

00:03:57.592 --> 00:03:59.468
Unlike many other therapies,

00:03:59.468 --> 00:04:02.478
bacteria don’t target a specific type 
of cancer,

00:04:02.478 --> 00:04:07.789
but rather the general characteristics 
shared by all solid tumors.

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:12.169
Nor are programmable bacteria 
limited to simply fighting cancer.

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:14.970
Instead, they can serve 
as sophisticated sensors

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.939
that monitor sites of future disease.

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:22.198
Safe probiotic bacteria could perhaps 
lie dormant within our guts,

00:04:22.198 --> 00:04:25.098
where they’d detect, prevent, 
and treat disorders

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.042
before they have the chance 
to cause symptoms.

00:04:28.042 --> 00:04:31.617
Advances in technology 
have created excitement around a future

00:04:31.617 --> 00:04:35.610
of personalized medicine 
driven by mechanical nanobots.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.224
But thanks to billions of years 
of evolution

00:04:38.224 --> 00:04:40.084
we may already have a starting point

00:04:40.084 --> 00:04:44.343
in the unexpectedly biological 
form of bacteria.

00:04:44.343 --> 00:04:46.620
Add synthetic biology to the mix,

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.637
and who knows what might soon be possible.
