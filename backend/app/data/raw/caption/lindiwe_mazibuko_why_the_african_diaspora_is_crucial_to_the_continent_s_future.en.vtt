Reviewer: Elisabeth Buffard

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.055
So, I'm here to recruit you.

00:00:16.055 --> 00:00:17.555
(Laughter)

00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:21.117
But not in the sense that you're thinking.
I know I'm a politician.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.189
I'll save that for another day.

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.460
I'm here to try and encourage you

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.189
to take up a leadership role
in public service

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.950
in your country and on your continent.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.380
I'm here to convince you

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.390
that your country
and your continent need you -

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.097
not later, not when you're older
and more experienced, but now -

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.798
and that whether you realize it or not,

00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:51.440
your country's politics
are going to be doomed to fail

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.489
unless you're willing
to get involved right now.

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:59.450
So my recruitment pitch 
comes with a single disclaimer:

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.645
I resigned from public office
18 months ago.

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:04.120
(Laughter)

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.989
I did it in order to take stock
of my time in office,

00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:09.074
to think about the work that I had done,

00:01:09.074 --> 00:01:12.550
to capacitate myself with skills,
knowledge, contacts,

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.660
allies and experiences,

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.820
and to find a little bit of personal
and professional perspective.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.779
It's one of the best decisions
I think I've ever made.

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.840
I imagine that some time during the next
18 minutes while I'm pitching you,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.150
you're going to think,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.250
"Yeah, it's easy for you to say
I should go into public service.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.600
You've already done it and you've left."

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.520
But I hope I'll be able to convince you

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.370
that, in fact, we all find ourselves
in exactly the same boat right now.

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.269
Because being outside
of politics for 18 months

00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:48.027
has reminded me
just how important it is

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:51.019
and just how much the political landscapes

00:01:51.019 --> 00:01:54.609
in my country and in your countries
and on our continent

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:59.765
are truly lacking in good leadership
and political talent.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.109
So, I want to make a deal with you.

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:07.760
I'm not going to return to active politics
unless you come with me.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.340
(Laughter)

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.170
I'm not going to do it alone.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.570
I won't go back unless I can convince
smart, entrepreneurial, highly skilled,

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.760
talented, experienced 
young Africans like yourselves

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.490
and millions more like you
across the continent,

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.810
that the best chance 
that our countries have,

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:28.800
not just for survival
but for lasting prosperity,

00:02:29.044 --> 00:02:32.051
is if our most talented
citizens step forward

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:34.539
and make themselves available,

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:38.602
either for political party, leadership
or for public service and government.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.950
So over the next 16-or-so minutes
that are remaining,

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.890
I'm going to alternately
flatter you, as I just have,

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.780
(Laughter)

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.069
I'm going to challenge you,

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.222
I'm going to talk to you
about my experiences,

00:02:49.222 --> 00:02:51.390
about a couple of facts and figures;

00:02:51.783 --> 00:02:53.730
I may even frighten you a little bit.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.710
And it'll be entirely worth it

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.400
if that fear convinces you
of the urgency of the point in history

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.700
that we find ourselves in today.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.804
Everything I say today will be
in service of a single objective:

00:03:05.804 --> 00:03:10.480
convincing you, showing you,
that your countries need you;

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.469
that Africa's prosperity
may depend on many things -

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:17.519
entrepreneurialism,
industrial development,

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:19.570
health reform, social upliftment -

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.548
but that all of these hinge

00:03:21.548 --> 00:03:25.899
upon the success of politics
and government in our countries.

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:29.811
I can't begin a talk
about public service, of course,

00:03:29.811 --> 00:03:33.240
without honoring my former
president Nelson Mandela,

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.670
the father of democratic South Africa.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.882
(Cheers) (Applause)

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:45.619
President Mandela passed away
on this day in 2013.

00:03:46.158 --> 00:03:48.549
I really believe that
when the people of my country

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.269
look back on the day that he passed away,

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.090
it'll be seen as an inflection point
in South Africa's history.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.560
The day we decided whether we could,
indeed, go it alone without him.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.579
What's written in those history books

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.269
will depend entirely
on whether this generation,

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.879
which includes all of you
sitting in this room,

00:04:09.462 --> 00:04:11.659
recognizes that the time has come for us

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.072
to take up the work
that President Mandela left for us,

00:04:15.072 --> 00:04:20.009
before that work is captured by people
who would use power and politics

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.690
for empty vanity and personal gain.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.229
I'm referring, of course,

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.499
to the young man who was here
in London this very past week.

00:04:29.674 --> 00:04:35.050
Defiling the name of the visionary leader,
the intellectual and political strategist,

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.510
the formidable athlete,
the Prince of the Abathembu nation

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.100
who served as a South Africa's
first democratic president.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.820
The young man who tried to taint
President Mandela's legacy

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.770
with a few throwaway lines,

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.390
all in service of getting 
cheap headlines, which he got.

00:04:52.708 --> 00:04:56.618
People like this,
who we leave public service to

00:04:56.618 --> 00:04:59.749
when we stay out
of the fray of public service,

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:04.740
are the reason your country
and my country needs you and needs us.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.840
So let us begin.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.319
I want to first talk to you 
about the African diaspora.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.939
You may have heard
about a study in 2013

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.154
that revealed

00:05:15.154 --> 00:05:20.414
that cash transfers from Africans
living outside of the continent

00:05:20.731 --> 00:05:26.037
have now begun to exceed donor aid
from foreign countries into Africa.

00:05:26.037 --> 00:05:28.410
(Applause)

00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:33.200
In 2012, total remittances to Africa
stood at 60 billion dollars

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.337
while in the same year,

00:05:34.337 --> 00:05:36.930
official development aid
to Sub-Saharan Africa

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.780
totalled 44.6 billion by comparison.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.180
Now, this got me thinking.

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.844
If we can do such great work
with our money from outside of Africa,

00:05:47.844 --> 00:05:51.310
what can we do with our skills,
our talent, our experiences,

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.645
our education and our passion
for our countries and for our continent?

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.020
I've spent the past semester
at the Harvard Kennedy School

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.080
as a fellow at the Institute of Politics.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.520
I ran a seminar which was called

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.640
"How to build a democracy?
Lessons from South Africa."

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.210
It was also about Zimbabwe and Malawi.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.313
And it wasn't intended

00:06:10.313 --> 00:06:13.420
to make it seem like we got
everything right in South Africa,

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.520
but it was asking the critical question:

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.160
Now that we have this legacy

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.480
of peaceful transition,
of constitutionalism,

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.443
of difficult negotiations,

00:06:21.443 --> 00:06:23.940
which were very, very difficultly gotten,

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.470
are we going to be successful
in entrenching that democracy

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.900
and making it last into the future?

00:06:30.181 --> 00:06:33.180
Now, one of the benefits
of being an African

00:06:33.829 --> 00:06:36.050
in an academic setting like New England

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.760
is that other African students
reach out to you,

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.220
they want to talk to you,

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.970
and many of them express to you
their desire to enter public service.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.370
So I had students knocking down my door,
wanting to talk to me in office hours

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.780
about the fact that they have
Ghanean parents

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.170
but they were born in Texas.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.270
They really wanted to give back to Ghana,

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.230
but they're afraid that if they go home,

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.580
nobody will take them
seriously as real Africans.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.530
I had students who said they had families,

00:07:01.898 --> 00:07:04.830
wives, children, husbands,
partners to take care of,

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:07.610
perhaps they were better off
staying in the United States

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.730
and providing for their families back home

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.537
rather than going back
and getting into public service.

00:07:14.822 --> 00:07:18.430
This got me thinking
about the question of skills remittance,

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.720
of talent remittance,
of social and political remittance.

00:07:23.316 --> 00:07:25.520
If these young people have the passion

00:07:25.795 --> 00:07:28.843
to give back to their
communities monetarily,

00:07:29.198 --> 00:07:31.983
imagine how different
our politics would be

00:07:31.983 --> 00:07:35.103
if those same skills,
influence, leadership, talent

00:07:35.103 --> 00:07:38.100
were put at work in service
of the public good.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.842
And that includes all of you in this room

00:07:40.842 --> 00:07:43.360
because many of you
are also part of the diaspora.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:45.690
I'm here to recruit you.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.749
I'm here to make a deal with you.

00:07:48.103 --> 00:07:51.610
I'm not going back
unless I take you with me.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:52.875
(Laugther)

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.860
Now, I know that most of you,
if not the vast majority of you,

00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:02.950
are completely fed up, turned off,
discouraged, disgusted by politics,

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.930
either in your country,
in this country, all over the world.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:11.000
Perhaps you are discouraged by the fact
that governments are slow to deliver.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.400
Perhaps they're inefficient. 

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.269
Perhaps they are thoroughly
corrupt and rotten to the core.

00:08:15.269 --> 00:08:18.690
Perhaps they're responsible
for conflicts that have claimed lives

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.669
and livelihoods in the countries
from which you come.

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:24.959
So why would you sink your time
and your energies

00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:27.010
into such a compromised system?

00:08:27.178 --> 00:08:28.806
One of the most powerful analyses

00:08:28.806 --> 00:08:32.368
of conflict, inefficiency,
corruption, stagnation

00:08:32.368 --> 00:08:35.499
which I've encountered
in recent months

00:08:35.499 --> 00:08:37.858
is the question of a political economy.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.969
There is a reason that our governments
are not performing as they should.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.409
It's not just because of
a failure within the system.

00:08:45.409 --> 00:08:49.550
Consider the political economy of conflict
and corruption in your own country.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.949
Why is it so difficult to overcome?

00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:55.020
Who is making money or amassing power

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.620
because things don't work
the way they should?

00:08:57.934 --> 00:08:59.820
Where does the back stop?

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.450
Who has an incentive to keep
the system dysfunctional?

00:09:03.787 --> 00:09:05.720
And how can we work together

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.980
to overcome their
total infection of the system,

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.540
to ensure that we don't lose our grip

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.810
on the very principle
of democratic governance?

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.050
The answer, I'm afraid,

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.535
because you were born
into this political time,

00:09:18.834 --> 00:09:20.710
is simply by taking over -

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.550
you have to get involved.

00:09:22.851 --> 00:09:24.370
There's no way around it.

00:09:24.589 --> 00:09:26.710
You have to join political organizations

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.980
in numbers large enough
to influence change from within.

00:09:31.305 --> 00:09:34.400
You have to actively seek
to take up a leadership role

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.723
in government, in the state,
in the public service

00:09:37.723 --> 00:09:42.329
and deftly but decisively move
its priorities to where they should be:

00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:47.030
not in the service of people who want
to amass power and money for themselves,

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.650
but to better the lives
of the highest number of people.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.569
There will always be government,

00:09:53.569 --> 00:09:55.650
whether we like it or not,

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.890
whether we find it palatable or not.

00:09:58.097 --> 00:10:00.440
But there won't always be democracy.

00:10:00.715 --> 00:10:02.380
If we ignore politics,

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.060
the people who have been quietly
lobbying our governments

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.989
to prioritize development
ahead of democracy,

00:10:08.234 --> 00:10:10.581
these are the people
who will have their way,

00:10:10.581 --> 00:10:15.359
and the systems that we now take
for granted will dissolve before our eyes.

00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:20.579
When I was campaigning in South Africa
last year for the 2014 general election,

00:10:20.579 --> 00:10:23.589
the voter registration numbers
looked a little bit like this,

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:25.540
six months before the election:

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:29.750
23% of potential voters 
in the 18-to-19-year-old age group

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.900
were registered to vote.

00:10:32.146 --> 00:10:37.080
In the age group 20 to 29 years old,
55% were registered.

00:10:37.661 --> 00:10:42.500
And from 30 upwards,
the number varied from 79 to 100%;

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:47.000
in fact, there were more people
aged 80 and over who were registered

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.969
than were in the census
numbers in South Africa.

00:10:50.119 --> 00:10:51.645
Imagine that.

00:10:52.354 --> 00:10:57.730
Fully 100% of people over a certain age

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.430
consider voting to be
an indispensable right,

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.130
21 years into democracy,

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:06.230
and do not shirk their responsibility
to register and turn out at the polls.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.120
But in the 18-to-19-year-old age group -

00:11:09.498 --> 00:11:12.510
and we must remember 19 is
the average age on our continent;

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.900
26 is the average age in South Africa -

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.680
the number is 23% to 55%.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.229
What's the political economy
of voter apathy?

00:11:20.229 --> 00:11:22.590
Who benefits when we stay
out of the system?

00:11:22.838 --> 00:11:24.915
Who gets to keep the status quo

00:11:24.915 --> 00:11:27.240
and empower themselves
and enrich themselves

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.330
and continue to infect
our political system like a cancer.

00:11:32.074 --> 00:11:36.860
Who banks by us continuing
with the status quo?

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:39.779
Now even as I say all of this to you,

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.559
that your country and your continent
need you to enter public service,

00:11:43.559 --> 00:11:45.479
I know that if you take up my challenge,

00:11:45.479 --> 00:11:47.990
you're going to face
huge amounts of resistance -

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:51.779
all because of these political economies
that I have just described.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.359
I did.

00:11:53.359 --> 00:11:55.375
I was told that I was too young.

00:11:55.375 --> 00:11:56.810
I was too female.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:57.830
(Laughter)

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:00.890
I didn't have enough experience

00:12:01.219 --> 00:12:04.079
though no one could define
what experience was enough.

00:12:04.739 --> 00:12:08.280
I had too much of a white accent;
I wasn't a real African.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:13.380
I straightened my hair and wore weaves;
I wasn't a real African.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.050
We should be honest

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:18.330
about the things that hold people back
from entering public service -

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.620
humiliation, degradation;
it's not an easy road -

00:12:21.868 --> 00:12:24.680
but all of these things
should illustrate to you

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.130
the extent to which
the status quo is designed

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:31.880
to enrich and empower a few
at the expense of the many,

00:12:32.176 --> 00:12:36.320
and it should impart to you 
the urgency of you, as a generation,

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.010
of now getting involved in public service

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:42.000
to change that very culture.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.360
And if you decide to enter public service,

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.470
you may even be tempted to believe
some of these criticisms.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.680
They're designed to keep you out;
that's how gatekeeping works.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.399
Somebody is benefiting

00:12:52.399 --> 00:12:57.230
from the absence of excellence
and disruption in politics and government.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.030
But these are challenges
that have to be faced on.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.740
There is no other route;
there is no wishing this away.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:08.390
They are the reason that your country
and your continent need you.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:13.830
We have this thing in politics in Africa;
it's called the "big man."

00:13:14.104 --> 00:13:17.610
The cult of personality - we've all heard
different terminologies for it.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.640
In South Africa, in particular,
this entails waiting for a great person

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.970
to come and save us from ourselves.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:28.740
Currently, we're waiting for
Cyril Ramaphosa or Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:33.370
or [inaudible] to come and save
South Africa from itself,

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:36.680
to save us from the mess 
that we find ourselves in

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.350
that perhaps another big man put us in.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.827
But how can a single personality
be held responsible

00:13:42.827 --> 00:13:45.510
for building or for running
a whole nation?

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.870
And where do we turn when they fail?

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.320
If we haven't cultivated any kind
of pipeline of energetic, young people

00:13:52.577 --> 00:13:55.570
who wanted to enter
public service now or in the future

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.080
and, critically,
who can do the job better,

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.918
are we doomed to always have to choose

00:13:59.918 --> 00:14:03.480
between mediocrity and ego,
and mediocrity and ego?

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.577
Is that it?

00:14:04.577 --> 00:14:06.940
Is that all our government will ever be?

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:12.480
Or worse: Are we going to stand by
while presidents change constitutions

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:17.080
so they can serve a third term
and a fourth term and a fifth term,

00:14:17.981 --> 00:14:20.990
claiming that three million people
signed a petition

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:23.720
stating that they are the only person
who can do the job?

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.180
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:27.930
Is that what we'll do?

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.040
Now, there's a new energy

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.380
around entrepreneurism
and innovation and growth

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.890
in Africa today.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:41.010
But that energy isn't going to translate
into lasting prosperity

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.220
unless we get our politics right.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.660
Political leaders who are
gatekeepers of the status quo

00:14:47.825 --> 00:14:51.590
will claim that any success
is their success.

00:14:51.907 --> 00:14:53.404
They'll centralize power,

00:14:53.404 --> 00:14:55.750
and they'll demand that we all be grateful

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.913
for those little green
shoots of achievement,

00:14:57.913 --> 00:15:00.608
and then they'll claim
that nobody else can do the job.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:05.660
They'll argue that development
must come first, freedom can come later,

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.350
and that they are the best
benevolent dictator to do the job.

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:15.010
They'll take your political voice from you
when times are a little bit good,

00:15:15.285 --> 00:15:19.150
and when times go bad,
they will refuse to give it back.

00:15:20.063 --> 00:15:22.796
There is no prosperity for our continent

00:15:22.796 --> 00:15:28.060
without a vibrant, diverse,
and truly competitive politics,

00:15:28.478 --> 00:15:33.630
founded upon excellence, transparency
and commitment to the public good.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.918
Our politics will not have
any of these qualities

00:15:36.918 --> 00:15:40.588
unless talented, young people,
the best people,

00:15:40.588 --> 00:15:45.644
step forward at this moment
in Africa's history,

00:15:45.644 --> 00:15:47.720
when we're emerging from that stereotype

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:51.003
of the dark continent,
the hopeless continent,

00:15:51.003 --> 00:15:53.900
and commit themselves to public service.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.350
We must run for office.

00:15:56.549 --> 00:15:58.631
We must work in the civil service.

00:15:58.728 --> 00:16:01.420
We must disrupt the political status quo.

00:16:01.548 --> 00:16:04.280
We must prevent the rush to the bottom.

00:16:05.368 --> 00:16:08.690
You really are the ones
that you have been waiting for.

00:16:08.988 --> 00:16:12.640
There are no great saviors
waiting somewhere in the wings

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.350
to save us from future problems.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:20.620
There's nobody who is waiting in the wings
to come and save us from ourselves;

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.060
there's just us.

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.010
And I'm not going back without you.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:26.160
(Laughter)

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.330
So, will you take up the challenge?

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:29.350
Thank you.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:31.790
(Cheers) (Applause)
