00:00:13.432 --> 00:00:14.883
[Recorded on October 26, 2020.

00:00:14.907 --> 00:00:16.258
COVID-19 vaccine development

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:18.902
and ethical considerations
around human challenge trials

00:00:18.926 --> 00:00:20.148
are constantly evolving.]

00:00:20.172 --> 00:00:21.854
In April 2020,

00:00:21.878 --> 00:00:24.320
I made what many perceive
as a risky decision.

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:28.765
I volunteered to be deliberately
infected with COVID-19.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.800
This infection would be part
of what is called a human challenge trial,

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:35.736
where young, healthy people
are given a vaccine

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.554
and are deliberately exposed
to the virus that causes COVID-19.

00:00:39.578 --> 00:00:42.196
These trials help researchers
figure out more quickly

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.068
if a vaccine is working.

00:00:45.585 --> 00:00:47.212
I think this research is crucial,

00:00:47.236 --> 00:00:50.259
because today, I'm going
to speak to you for six minutes.

00:00:50.283 --> 00:00:51.434
In that time,

00:00:51.458 --> 00:00:55.844
roughly 1,250 people will be
confirmed infected with COVID-19.

00:00:56.481 --> 00:00:58.425
Twenty-one people will die.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.329
And then this pattern will repeat
hour after hour and day by day,

00:01:03.353 --> 00:01:06.435
until we're able to vaccinate
most of the eight billion people

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:08.526
affected by this global crisis.

00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:11.275
Scientists have been working
around the clock

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.362
to make those vaccines a reality.

00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:17.862
But what should we do when the human cost
of waiting for those vaccines

00:01:17.886 --> 00:01:19.338
is rising by the day?

00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:21.973
This is where human
challenge trials come in.

00:01:22.458 --> 00:01:25.514
They're different from the traditional
phase three vaccine trials

00:01:25.538 --> 00:01:26.720
taking place now,

00:01:26.744 --> 00:01:28.934
where people are given
a vaccine or placebo

00:01:28.958 --> 00:01:31.497
and asked to go about
their everyday lives.

00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:35.283
Here, researchers have to wait
to see how many people in each group

00:01:35.307 --> 00:01:36.587
become infected.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.807
Until enough of them get sick,

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:42.298
we don't have enough data
to know whether a vaccine is working.

00:01:42.322 --> 00:01:44.418
Finding an effective vaccine
with this method

00:01:44.442 --> 00:01:47.093
can take months or sometimes years,

00:01:47.117 --> 00:01:49.497
and it requires thousands of volunteers.

00:01:50.624 --> 00:01:52.410
A challenge trial works faster

00:01:52.434 --> 00:01:54.196
because researchers control exposure,

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.569
instead of waiting for people to get sick.

00:01:56.593 --> 00:01:58.680
So instead of a year,

00:01:58.704 --> 00:02:00.482
we could know in as little as a month

00:02:00.506 --> 00:02:02.532
whether a vaccine seems effective.

00:02:02.926 --> 00:02:04.822
Instead of thousands of volunteers,

00:02:04.846 --> 00:02:07.902
a challenge trial relies
on just 50 to 100.

00:02:08.385 --> 00:02:09.712
Because we know for certain

00:02:09.736 --> 00:02:12.148
when people are exposed
and develop disease,

00:02:12.172 --> 00:02:14.545
these trials also allow us to gather data

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.053
about the early stages of infection
and our immune response.

00:02:18.624 --> 00:02:21.553
This data is impossible to gather
in any other way,

00:02:21.577 --> 00:02:25.346
especially for people who become infected
but never show symptoms.

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:28.759
This knowledge is important
for designing policies

00:02:28.783 --> 00:02:30.983
that limit COVID-19 transmission.

00:02:31.497 --> 00:02:34.823
The time saved translates
into precious months' head start

00:02:34.847 --> 00:02:36.259
on manufacturing,

00:02:36.283 --> 00:02:39.581
getting us more working
COVID-19 vaccines faster.

00:02:39.885 --> 00:02:41.124
These trials are useful --

00:02:41.148 --> 00:02:44.042
even though recent phase three results
sound encouraging.

00:02:44.737 --> 00:02:48.673
The arrival of the first vaccine
is going to be a monumental breakthrough.

00:02:49.094 --> 00:02:52.221
It just isn't quite the fairytale ending
we're all hoping for.

00:02:53.102 --> 00:02:55.283
We're going to need multiple vaccines,

00:02:55.307 --> 00:02:57.759
because we just don't have
the infrastructure needed

00:02:57.783 --> 00:03:01.322
to immunize all eight billion people
on the planet with just one kind.

00:03:01.743 --> 00:03:05.482
Each type of vaccine requires
its own special process and equipment

00:03:05.506 --> 00:03:07.937
to make, store and deliver it.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.403
If we had multiple
working COVID-19 vaccines,

00:03:11.427 --> 00:03:14.537
we could make use of all
of our equipment at the same time.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.482
Some of the leading candidates
need to be kept extremely cold

00:03:18.506 --> 00:03:20.530
before they are delivered to people.

00:03:20.554 --> 00:03:21.720
This can be really hard,

00:03:21.744 --> 00:03:24.998
especially in countries
where there isn't reliable electricity

00:03:25.022 --> 00:03:26.784
or a secure method to store them.

00:03:27.421 --> 00:03:29.831
Scientists have been using
human challenge trials

00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:31.571
for hundreds of years.

00:03:31.595 --> 00:03:35.413
They've sped up the development
of vaccines against typhoid and cholera,

00:03:35.437 --> 00:03:38.310
and they've helped us better understand
how immunity develops

00:03:38.334 --> 00:03:41.214
to things like the flu,
malaria and dengue.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.071
We've even used them
for other types of coronavirus before.

00:03:46.731 --> 00:03:48.080
There's been a lot of debate

00:03:48.104 --> 00:03:50.341
about whether challenge
trials are too risky.

00:03:51.096 --> 00:03:54.135
I happen to think
that those risks are worth taking.

00:03:54.745 --> 00:03:58.111
A challenge trial would only recruit
young and healthy participants --

00:03:58.135 --> 00:04:00.952
think between the ages of 20 and 29.

00:04:01.858 --> 00:04:04.205
Fewer than one percent of people
in that age-group

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:07.908
need to be taken to hospital
after becoming infected with COVID-19.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.024
So it would likely be even lower
in a challenge trial,

00:04:11.048 --> 00:04:12.905
because researchers check to make sure

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:15.515
that participants have
no preexisting conditions.

00:04:16.143 --> 00:04:19.754
The risk of a young healthy person
dying of COVID-19

00:04:19.778 --> 00:04:22.267
is around five thousandths of a percent.

00:04:22.857 --> 00:04:27.762
That means for every 100,000 20-year-olds
who become infected with COVID-19,

00:04:27.786 --> 00:04:29.159
about five die.

00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:32.739
If I were to give birth
in the United States,

00:04:32.763 --> 00:04:35.225
my risk of dying
would be higher than that.

00:04:36.088 --> 00:04:38.681
Or you could choose
to think about it this way.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.317
If my little sister needed a kidney,

00:04:41.341 --> 00:04:44.269
I wouldn't hesitate for a moment
before I offered her mine.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.277
And if I can take on that risk
to benefit a loved one,

00:04:48.301 --> 00:04:51.720
it makes sense to allow people
to take on a similar risk

00:04:51.744 --> 00:04:53.807
to speed up the development of a vaccine

00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:56.649
that would benefit
not just their loved ones,

00:04:56.673 --> 00:04:58.577
but everyone around them as well.

00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:00.246
There's a lot we still don't know,

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.470
especially about the long-term
effects of COVID-19 infection.

00:05:04.088 --> 00:05:06.191
I volunteered despite that uncertainty

00:05:06.215 --> 00:05:08.411
because like many of you,
I feel frustrated

00:05:08.435 --> 00:05:11.340
knowing that hundreds
of thousands of people are dying.

00:05:11.364 --> 00:05:14.927
And that's without mentioning
the millions more who are struggling

00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:18.278
as measures to stop the spread
take a toll on their physical,

00:05:18.302 --> 00:05:20.540
emotional and mental well-being.

00:05:20.564 --> 00:05:23.421
It turns out I'm not alone
in feeling this way.

00:05:24.111 --> 00:05:27.718
Since May, over 39,000 people
from across the world

00:05:27.742 --> 00:05:31.480
have volunteered to participate
in potential COVID-19 challenge trials

00:05:31.504 --> 00:05:34.543
through a nonprofit I helped found
called 1Day Sooner.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.080
We advocate for challenge
trial participants

00:05:37.104 --> 00:05:40.936
and have been encouraging stakeholders
to begin preparing for these trials.

00:05:41.881 --> 00:05:43.087
As early as May,

00:05:43.111 --> 00:05:45.414
when challenge trials
were still being considered

00:05:45.438 --> 00:05:48.087
for their role in the fight
against COVID-19,

00:05:48.111 --> 00:05:50.850
the World Health Organization
cited 1Day Sooner

00:05:50.874 --> 00:05:53.635
as an example of the kind
of public engagement needed

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:55.237
to run a challenge trial.

00:05:55.261 --> 00:05:56.437
In mid-October,

00:05:56.461 --> 00:05:59.381
the UK government
formally announced their intention

00:05:59.405 --> 00:06:02.944
to conduct a challenge trial
at the beginning of 2021.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.217
It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic
is a global crisis.

00:06:07.614 --> 00:06:10.295
It has inspired
record-shattering innovation,

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:13.828
and it has highlighted the heroic acts
of many frontline workers,

00:06:13.852 --> 00:06:16.365
but is has also taken a catastrophic toll.

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:20.960
The arrival of each new vaccine
brings us one step closer to rebuilding.

00:06:20.984 --> 00:06:23.032
But the true global solution

00:06:23.056 --> 00:06:26.963
lies in those vaccines being in the hands
of people all over the world.

00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:29.661
Challenge trials could be
a part of that solution.

00:06:30.311 --> 00:06:31.462
Thank you.
