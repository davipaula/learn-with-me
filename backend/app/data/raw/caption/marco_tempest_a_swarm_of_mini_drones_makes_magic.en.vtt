00:00:14.888 --> 00:00:21.730
So, I have a background
in technology and magic.

00:00:22.402 --> 00:00:24.556
And magicians are interesting.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.205
Their illusions accomplish
what technology cannot.

00:00:29.674 --> 00:00:33.477
But what happens when
the technology of the day

00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:36.274
seems almost magical?

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:40.271
What happens when you can do this?

00:00:41.294 --> 00:00:44.119
(Music)

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.608
Now, 100 years ago,

00:01:00.632 --> 00:01:03.210
that would have been
the magic of levitation.

00:01:03.234 --> 00:01:05.989
Is it possible to create illusions

00:01:06.013 --> 00:01:11.700
in a world where technology
makes anything possible?

00:01:11.724 --> 00:01:12.887
Jump!

00:01:12.911 --> 00:01:15.298
Now, if you know how the trick is done,

00:01:15.322 --> 00:01:16.918
where is the illusion?

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:22.447
But still, our imagination
is more powerful than our reasoning,

00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:27.707
and it's easy to attribute
personality to machines.

00:01:28.204 --> 00:01:30.630
These are quadcopters.

00:01:30.654 --> 00:01:34.446
But they are more than
mechanical flying machines.

00:01:34.888 --> 00:01:37.096
They analyze the environment around them

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.845
and react to everything I do.

00:01:41.415 --> 00:01:47.945
At once, algorithms allow these autonomous
machines to fly in close formation,

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:49.730
aware of each other

00:01:49.754 --> 00:01:51.349
and aware of me --

00:01:51.373 --> 00:01:54.997
mathematics that can
be mistaken for intelligence,

00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:58.905
and intelligence for personality.

00:01:59.512 --> 00:02:02.155
Anthropomorphism: that's the illusion,

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.234
an illusion created by technology

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:10.178
and embroidered by our imagination

00:02:10.202 --> 00:02:15.019
to become an intelligent flying robot,

00:02:15.043 --> 00:02:18.718
a machine that appears to be alive.

00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:23.176
(Music plays 
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind")

00:02:26.655 --> 00:02:28.454
(Quadcopters make tones)

00:02:28.454 --> 00:02:30.080
I think they say, "Hello."

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.830
Hey guys! Come on.

00:02:33.135 --> 00:02:35.874
And time to land.

00:02:37.253 --> 00:02:38.421
And that's it.

00:02:38.445 --> 00:02:39.696
Thank you.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.540
(Applause)

00:02:44.775 --> 00:02:49.407
OK, guys, time to go home.

00:02:49.431 --> 00:02:50.948
Everybody in here.

00:02:50.972 --> 00:02:54.628
Come on, everybody, quickly, quickly.

00:02:54.652 --> 00:02:57.832
No pushing, everybody can fit.

00:02:57.856 --> 00:03:01.130
There you go, a little bit to the left,
a little bit to the right.

00:03:01.154 --> 00:03:03.539
Come on, everybody, everybody,

00:03:03.563 --> 00:03:05.713
and ... good job!

00:03:05.737 --> 00:03:07.339
(Cheers)

00:03:07.363 --> 00:03:08.534
Thank you.

00:03:08.558 --> 00:03:11.151
(Applause)

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:14.945
Thank you.

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:17.769
(Applause)
