00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:15.953
It may seem like we're all standing
on solid earth right now,

00:00:15.977 --> 00:00:17.350
but we're not.

00:00:17.753 --> 00:00:22.150
The rocks and the dirt underneath us
are crisscrossed by tiny little fractures

00:00:22.174 --> 00:00:23.573
and empty spaces.

00:00:23.597 --> 00:00:28.526
And these empty spaces are filled
with astronomical quantities of microbes,

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.817
such as these ones.

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:34.229
The deepest that we found microbes
so far into the earth

00:00:34.253 --> 00:00:36.141
is five kilometers down.

00:00:36.165 --> 00:00:38.321
So like, if you pointed
yourself at the ground

00:00:38.345 --> 00:00:40.664
and took off running into the ground,

00:00:40.688 --> 00:00:44.359
you could run an entire 5K race
and microbes would line your whole path.

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:47.568
So you may not have ever thought
about these microbes

00:00:47.592 --> 00:00:49.282
that are deep inside earth's crust,

00:00:49.306 --> 00:00:52.268
but you probably thought
about the microbes living in our guts.

00:00:52.292 --> 00:00:54.109
If you add up the gut microbiomes

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.974
of all the people
and all the animals on the planet,

00:00:56.998 --> 00:01:00.907
collectively, this weighs
about 100,000 tons.

00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:05.224
This is a huge biome that we carry
in our bellies every single day.

00:01:05.907 --> 00:01:07.324
We should all be proud.

00:01:07.348 --> 00:01:08.454
(Laughter)

00:01:08.478 --> 00:01:12.350
But it pales in comparison
to the number of microbes

00:01:12.374 --> 00:01:14.859
that are covering
the entire surface of the earth,

00:01:14.883 --> 00:01:17.714
like in our soils,
our rivers and our oceans.

00:01:17.738 --> 00:01:21.611
Collectively, these weigh
about two billion tons.

00:01:22.174 --> 00:01:24.770
But it turns out that the majority
of microbes on earth

00:01:24.794 --> 00:01:28.571
aren't even in oceans or our guts
or sewage treatment plants.

00:01:28.595 --> 00:01:31.372
Most of them are actually
inside the earth's crust.

00:01:31.396 --> 00:01:35.245
So collectively,
these weigh 40 billion tons.

00:01:35.754 --> 00:01:39.045
This is one of the biggest
biomes on the planet,

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:42.505
and we didn't even know it existed
until a few decades ago.

00:01:42.847 --> 00:01:45.542
So the possibilities
for what life is like down there,

00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:48.111
or what it might do for humans,

00:01:48.135 --> 00:01:49.835
are limitless.

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:52.239
This is a map showing a red dot

00:01:52.263 --> 00:01:55.621
for every place where we've gotten
pretty good deep subsurface samples

00:01:55.645 --> 00:01:57.463
with modern microbiological methods,

00:01:57.487 --> 00:01:58.870
and you may be impressed

00:01:58.894 --> 00:02:01.204
that we're getting a pretty good
global coverage,

00:02:01.228 --> 00:02:04.085
but actually, if you remember
that these are the only places

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.490
that we have samples from,
it looks a little worse.

00:02:06.514 --> 00:02:08.323
If we were all in an alien spaceship,

00:02:08.347 --> 00:02:12.006
trying to reconstruct a map of the globe
from only these samples,

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.352
we'd never be able to do it.

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:17.519
So people sometimes say to me,

00:02:17.543 --> 00:02:21.059
"Yeah, there's a lot of microbes
in the subsurface, but ...

00:02:21.083 --> 00:02:22.733
aren't they just kind of dormant?"

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.227
This is a good point.

00:02:25.251 --> 00:02:30.101
Relative to a ficus plant or the measles
or my kid's guinea pigs,

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:33.156
these microbes probably
aren't doing much of anything at all.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.006
We know that they have to be slow,
because there's so many of them.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.720
If they all started dividing
at the rate of E. coli,

00:02:39.744 --> 00:02:43.061
then they would double the entire
weight of the earth, rocks included,

00:02:43.085 --> 00:02:44.561
over a single night.

00:02:45.046 --> 00:02:49.579
In fact, many of them probably haven't
even undergone a single cell division

00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:51.736
since the time of ancient Egypt.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.640
Which is just crazy.

00:02:53.664 --> 00:02:59.242
Like, how do you wrap your head
around things that are so long-lived?

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:02.410
But I thought of an analogy
that I really love,

00:03:02.434 --> 00:03:04.255
but it's weird and it's complicated.

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:06.450
So I hope that you can all
go there with me.

00:03:06.474 --> 00:03:07.720
Alright, let's try it.

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.148
It's like trying to figure out
the life cycle of a tree ...

00:03:11.172 --> 00:03:13.117
if you only lived for a day.

00:03:13.141 --> 00:03:17.522
So like if human life span was only a day,
and we lived in winter,

00:03:17.546 --> 00:03:19.171
then you would go your entire life

00:03:19.195 --> 00:03:21.768
without ever seeing a tree
with a leaf on it.

00:03:21.792 --> 00:03:23.847
And there would be so many
human generations

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:25.895
that would pass by within a single winter

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.315
that you may not even have access
to a history book

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:32.141
that says anything other than the fact
that trees are always lifeless sticks

00:03:32.165 --> 00:03:33.696
that don't do anything.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.379
Of course, this is ridiculous.

00:03:35.403 --> 00:03:37.553
We know that trees
are just waiting for summer

00:03:37.577 --> 00:03:38.926
so they can reactivate.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.125
But if the human life span

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:44.228
were significantly shorter
than that of trees,

00:03:44.252 --> 00:03:48.107
we might be completely oblivious
to this totally mundane fact.

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:53.807
So when we say that these deep
subsurface microbes are just dormant,

00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:58.003
are we like people who die after a day,
trying to figure out how trees work?

00:03:58.601 --> 00:04:00.491
What if these deep subsurface organisms

00:04:00.515 --> 00:04:02.822
are just waiting
for their version of summer,

00:04:02.846 --> 00:04:05.913
but our lives are too short
for us to see it?

00:04:06.784 --> 00:04:10.324
If you take E. coli
and seal it up in a test tube,

00:04:10.348 --> 00:04:11.690
with no food or nutrients,

00:04:11.714 --> 00:04:14.182
and leave it there for months to years,

00:04:14.206 --> 00:04:17.222
most of the cells die off, of course,
because they're starving.

00:04:17.246 --> 00:04:19.552
But a few of the cells survive.

00:04:19.576 --> 00:04:21.766
If you take these old surviving cells

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.657
and compete them,
also under starvation conditions,

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.855
against a new, fast-growing
culture of E. coli,

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:31.618
the grizzled old tough guys
beat out the squeaky clean upstarts

00:04:31.642 --> 00:04:32.990
every single time.

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:37.942
So this is evidence there's actually
an evolutionary payoff

00:04:37.966 --> 00:04:40.180
to being extraordinarily slow.

00:04:40.736 --> 00:04:42.625
So it's possible

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:49.389
that maybe we should not equate
being slow with being unimportant.

00:04:50.402 --> 00:04:53.084
Maybe these out-of-sight,
out-of-mind microbes

00:04:53.108 --> 00:04:55.315
could actually be helpful to humanity.

00:04:56.125 --> 00:04:57.407
OK, so as far as we know,

00:04:57.431 --> 00:04:59.537
there are two ways to do
subsurface living.

00:04:59.871 --> 00:05:03.513
The first is to wait for food
to trickle down from the surface world,

00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:08.045
like trying to eat the leftovers
of a picnic that happened 1,000 years ago.

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:10.093
Which is a crazy way to live,

00:05:10.117 --> 00:05:13.275
but shockingly seems to work out
for a lot of microbes in earth.

00:05:13.698 --> 00:05:17.119
The other possibility
is for a microbe to just say,

00:05:17.143 --> 00:05:19.618
"Nah, I don't need the surface world.

00:05:19.642 --> 00:05:21.095
I'm good down here."

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:22.791
For microbes that go this route,

00:05:22.815 --> 00:05:26.458
they have to get everything
that they need in order to survive

00:05:26.482 --> 00:05:28.299
from inside the earth.

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:32.661
Some things are actually
easier for them to get.

00:05:32.685 --> 00:05:34.553
They're more abundant inside the earth,

00:05:34.577 --> 00:05:38.395
like water or nutrients,
like nitrogen and iron and phosphorus,

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:39.592
or places to live.

00:05:39.616 --> 00:05:42.776
These are things that we literally
kill each other to get ahold of

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.014
up at the surface world.

00:05:44.038 --> 00:05:47.569
But in the subsurface,
the problem is finding enough energy.

00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:49.291
Up at the surface,

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:53.403
plants can chemically knit together
carbon dioxide molecules into yummy sugars

00:05:53.427 --> 00:05:56.403
as fast as the sun's photons
hit their leaves.

00:05:56.427 --> 00:05:58.955
But in the subsurface, of course,
there's no sunlight,

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.693
so this ecosystem has to solve the problem

00:06:01.717 --> 00:06:04.982
of who is going to make the food
for everybody else.

00:06:05.416 --> 00:06:09.291
The subsurface needs something
that's like a plant

00:06:09.315 --> 00:06:11.102
but it breathes rocks.

00:06:11.641 --> 00:06:14.776
Luckily, such a thing exists,

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.124
and it's called a chemolithoautotroph.

00:06:17.148 --> 00:06:18.156
(Laughter)

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.204
Which is a microbe
that uses chemicals -- "chemo,"

00:06:22.228 --> 00:06:24.458
from rocks -- "litho,"

00:06:24.482 --> 00:06:27.244
to make food -- "autotroph."

00:06:27.268 --> 00:06:29.926
And they can do this
with a ton of different elements.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.783
They can do this with sulphur,
iron, manganese, nitrogen, carbon,

00:06:33.807 --> 00:06:37.037
some of them can use
pure electrons, straight up.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.942
Like, if you cut the end
off of an electrical cord,

00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:41.875
they could breathe it like a snorkel.

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:43.211
(Laughter)

00:06:43.235 --> 00:06:44.736
These chemolithoautotrophs

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.395
take the energy that they get
from these processes

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:49.831
and use it to make food, like plants do.

00:06:49.855 --> 00:06:52.658
But we know that plants do more
than just make food.

00:06:53.103 --> 00:06:55.419
They also make a waste product, oxygen,

00:06:55.443 --> 00:06:57.471
which we are 100 percent dependent upon.

00:06:57.992 --> 00:07:01.277
But the waste product
that these chemolithoautotrophs make

00:07:01.301 --> 00:07:03.268
is often in the form of minerals,

00:07:03.292 --> 00:07:07.871
like rust or pyrite, like fool's gold,

00:07:07.895 --> 00:07:09.895
or carminites, like limestone.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:17.283
So what we have are microbes
that are really, really slow, like rocks,

00:07:18.243 --> 00:07:21.649
that get their energy from rocks,

00:07:21.673 --> 00:07:24.870
that make as their waste
product other rocks.

00:07:25.268 --> 00:07:29.089
So am I talking about biology,
or am I talking about geology?

00:07:29.466 --> 00:07:31.609
This stuff really blurs the lines.

00:07:31.633 --> 00:07:32.637
(Laughter)

00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:34.807
So if I'm going to do this thing,

00:07:34.831 --> 00:07:38.149
and I'm going to be a biologist
who studies microbes

00:07:38.173 --> 00:07:40.378
that kind of act like rocks,

00:07:40.402 --> 00:07:43.776
then I should probably
start studying geology.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.910
And what's the coolest part of geology?

00:07:47.292 --> 00:07:48.460
Volcanoes.

00:07:48.484 --> 00:07:49.735
(Laughter)

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:53.480
This is looking inside the crater
of Poás Volcano in Costa Rica.

00:07:53.854 --> 00:07:57.632
Many volcanoes on earth arise
because an oceanic tectonic plate

00:07:57.656 --> 00:07:59.466
crashes into a continental plate.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.403
As this oceanic plate subducts

00:08:01.427 --> 00:08:03.792
or gets moved underneath
this continental plate,

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:06.657
things like water and carbon dioxide
and other materials

00:08:06.681 --> 00:08:07.916
get squeezed out of it,

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.666
like ringing a wet washcloth.

00:08:10.382 --> 00:08:14.064
So in this way, subduction zones
are like portals into the deep earth,

00:08:14.088 --> 00:08:17.849
where materials are exchanged between
the surface and the subsurface world.

00:08:17.873 --> 00:08:20.901
So I was recently invited
by some of my colleagues in Costa Rica

00:08:20.925 --> 00:08:24.028
to come and work with them
on some of the volcanoes.

00:08:24.052 --> 00:08:28.650
And of course I said yes,
because, I mean, Costa Rica is beautiful,

00:08:28.674 --> 00:08:31.954
but also because it sits on top
of one of these subduction zones.

00:08:32.478 --> 00:08:35.272
We wanted to ask
the very specific question:

00:08:35.296 --> 00:08:37.684
Why is it that the carbon dioxide

00:08:37.708 --> 00:08:40.684
that comes out of this deeply buried
oceanic tectonic plate

00:08:40.708 --> 00:08:42.815
is only coming out of the volcanoes?

00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:46.133
Why don't we see it distributed
throughout the entire subduction zone?

00:08:46.157 --> 00:08:48.640
Do the microbes have something
to do with that?

00:08:48.664 --> 00:08:52.287
So this is a picture of me
inside Poás Volcano,

00:08:52.311 --> 00:08:54.495
along with my colleague
Donato Giovannelli.

00:08:54.519 --> 00:08:58.121
That lake that we're standing next to
is made of pure battery acid.

00:08:58.145 --> 00:09:01.867
I know this because we were measuring
the pH when this picture was taken.

00:09:02.362 --> 00:09:05.093
And at some point while
we were working inside the crater,

00:09:05.117 --> 00:09:09.696
I turned to my Costa Rican colleague
Carlos Ramírez and I said,

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.087
"Alright, if this thing
starts erupting right now,

00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:14.844
what's our exit strategy?"

00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:18.412
And he said, "Oh, yeah,
great question, it's totally easy.

00:09:18.436 --> 00:09:21.514
Just turn around and enjoy the view."

00:09:21.538 --> 00:09:22.831
(Laughter)

00:09:22.855 --> 00:09:24.402
"Because it will be your last."

00:09:24.426 --> 00:09:25.561
(Laughter)

00:09:25.585 --> 00:09:29.030
And it may sound like
he was being overly dramatic,

00:09:29.054 --> 00:09:33.807
but 54 days after I was standing
next to that lake,

00:09:33.831 --> 00:09:35.252
this happened.

00:09:35.276 --> 00:09:36.434
Audience: Oh!

00:09:37.204 --> 00:09:38.854
Freaking terrifying, right?

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:40.028
(Laughs)

00:09:40.934 --> 00:09:45.287
This was the biggest eruption
this volcano had had in 60-some-odd years,

00:09:45.311 --> 00:09:47.795
and not long after this video ends,

00:09:47.819 --> 00:09:50.462
the camera that was taking
the video is obliterated

00:09:50.486 --> 00:09:52.906
and the entire lake
that we had been sampling

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:54.330
vaporizes completely.

00:09:54.815 --> 00:09:56.617
But I also want to be clear

00:09:56.641 --> 00:09:59.141
that we were pretty sure
this was not going to happen

00:09:59.165 --> 00:10:01.418
on the day that we were
actually in the volcano,

00:10:01.442 --> 00:10:04.075
because Costa Rica monitors
its volcanoes very carefully

00:10:04.099 --> 00:10:05.662
through the OVSICORI Institute,

00:10:05.686 --> 00:10:08.892
and we had scientists from that institute
with us on that day.

00:10:08.916 --> 00:10:12.006
But the fact that it erupted
illustrates perfectly

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.538
that if you want to look
for where carbon dioxide gas

00:10:14.562 --> 00:10:16.426
is coming out of this oceanic plate,

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.553
then you should look no further
than the volcanoes themselves.

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:21.846
But if you go to Costa Rica,

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.330
you may notice that in addition
to these volcanoes

00:10:24.354 --> 00:10:27.598
there are tons of cozy little hot springs
all over the place.

00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:31.339
Some of the water in these hot springs
is actually bubbling up

00:10:31.363 --> 00:10:33.664
from this deeply buried oceanic plate.

00:10:33.688 --> 00:10:37.184
And our hypothesis was
that there should be carbon dioxide

00:10:37.208 --> 00:10:38.387
bubbling up with it,

00:10:38.411 --> 00:10:41.593
but something deep underground
was filtering it out.

00:10:41.617 --> 00:10:45.799
So we spent two weeks
driving all around Costa Rica,

00:10:45.823 --> 00:10:48.720
sampling every hot spring we could find --

00:10:48.744 --> 00:10:50.418
it was awful, let me tell you.

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:56.078
And then we spent the next two years
measuring and analyzing data.

00:10:56.102 --> 00:10:59.911
And if you're not a scientist, I'll just
let you know that the big discoveries

00:10:59.935 --> 00:11:02.768
don't really happen
when you're at a beautiful hot spring

00:11:02.792 --> 00:11:03.943
or on a public stage;

00:11:03.967 --> 00:11:06.490
they happen when you're hunched
over a messy computer

00:11:06.514 --> 00:11:08.831
or you're troubleshooting
a difficult instrument,

00:11:08.855 --> 00:11:10.593
or you're Skyping your colleagues

00:11:10.617 --> 00:11:13.212
because you are completely
confused about your data.

00:11:13.236 --> 00:11:16.567
Scientific discoveries,
kind of like deep subsurface microbes,

00:11:16.591 --> 00:11:18.359
can be very, very slow.

00:11:19.267 --> 00:11:22.616
But in our case,
this really paid off this one time.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.918
We discovered that literally
tons of carbon dioxide

00:11:26.942 --> 00:11:30.125
were coming out of this
deeply buried oceanic plate.

00:11:30.149 --> 00:11:32.498
And the thing that was keeping
them underground

00:11:32.522 --> 00:11:35.517
and keeping it from being released
out into the atmosphere

00:11:35.541 --> 00:11:37.101
was that deep underground,

00:11:37.125 --> 00:11:41.109
underneath all the adorable sloths
and toucans of Costa Rica,

00:11:41.133 --> 00:11:42.933
were chemolithoautotrophs.

00:11:43.338 --> 00:11:46.839
These microbes and the chemical processes
that were happening around them

00:11:46.863 --> 00:11:49.615
were converting this carbon dioxide
into carbonate mineral

00:11:49.639 --> 00:11:51.567
and locking it up underground.

00:11:51.591 --> 00:11:53.885
Which makes you wonder:

00:11:53.909 --> 00:11:57.410
If these subsurface processes
are so good at sucking up

00:11:57.434 --> 00:12:00.015
all the carbon dioxide
coming from below them,

00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:02.499
could they also help us
with a little carbon problem

00:12:02.523 --> 00:12:04.688
we've got going on up at the surface?

00:12:05.006 --> 00:12:09.331
Humans are releasing enough
carbon dioxide into our atmosphere

00:12:09.355 --> 00:12:12.329
that we are decreasing
the ability of our planet

00:12:12.353 --> 00:12:14.353
to support life as we know it.

00:12:14.704 --> 00:12:17.136
And scientists and engineers
and entrepreneurs

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.664
are working on methods
to pull carbon dioxide

00:12:19.688 --> 00:12:20.981
out of these point sources,

00:12:21.005 --> 00:12:23.323
so that they're not released
into the atmosphere.

00:12:23.347 --> 00:12:24.998
And they need to put it somewhere.

00:12:25.022 --> 00:12:26.199
So for this reason,

00:12:26.223 --> 00:12:29.561
we need to keep studying places
where this carbon might be stored,

00:12:29.585 --> 00:12:31.879
possibly in the subsurface,

00:12:31.903 --> 00:12:34.546
to know what's going to happen to it
when it goes there.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.037
Will these deep subsurface microbes
be a problem because they're too slow

00:12:38.061 --> 00:12:39.942
to actually keep anything down there?

00:12:39.966 --> 00:12:41.374
Or will they be helpful

00:12:41.398 --> 00:12:45.188
because they'll help convert this stuff
to solid carbonate minerals?

00:12:45.712 --> 00:12:48.132
If we can make such a big breakthrough

00:12:48.156 --> 00:12:50.542
just from one study
that we did in Costa Rica,

00:12:50.566 --> 00:12:53.533
then imagine what else
is waiting to be discovered down there.

00:12:53.891 --> 00:12:59.556
This new field of geo-bio-chemistry,
or deep subsurface biology,

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.121
or whatever you want to call it,

00:13:01.145 --> 00:13:02.982
is going to have huge implications,

00:13:03.006 --> 00:13:05.379
not just for mitigating climate change,

00:13:05.403 --> 00:13:09.275
but possibly for understanding
how life and earth have coevolved,

00:13:09.613 --> 00:13:14.311
or finding new products that are useful
for industrial or medical applications.

00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:16.597
Maybe even predicting earthquakes

00:13:16.621 --> 00:13:18.819
or finding life outside our planet.

00:13:18.843 --> 00:13:21.969
It could even help us understand
the origin of life itself.

00:13:22.827 --> 00:13:25.652
Fortunately, I don't have
to do this by myself.

00:13:25.962 --> 00:13:29.287
I have amazing colleagues
all over the world

00:13:29.311 --> 00:13:32.603
who are cracking into the mysteries
of this deep subsurface world.

00:13:33.831 --> 00:13:38.641
And it may seem like life
buried deep within the earth's crust

00:13:38.665 --> 00:13:42.639
is so far away from our daily experiences
that it's kind of irrelevant.

00:13:43.363 --> 00:13:47.051
But the truth is
that this weird, slow life

00:13:47.075 --> 00:13:50.600
may actually have the answers
to some of the greatest mysteries

00:13:50.624 --> 00:13:51.774
of life on earth.

00:13:52.225 --> 00:13:53.376
Thank you.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:58.444
(Applause)
