00:00:06.804 --> 00:00:12.165
In 1917, doctors proposed 
an outlandish treatment for syphilis,

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:17.004
the incurable bacterial infection 
that had ravaged Europe for centuries.

00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:22.118
Step 1: Infect patients suffering 
from the later stages of syphilis

00:00:22.118 --> 00:00:24.928
with the parasite that causes malaria,

00:00:24.928 --> 00:00:28.870
the deadly but curable 
mosquito-borne disease.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.851
Step 2: Hope that malarial fevers 
clear the syphilis.

00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:38.141
And step 3: Administer quinine 
to curb the malaria.

00:00:38.141 --> 00:00:40.101
If all went according to plan,

00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:44.390
their patient would be left alive 
and free of both diseases.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.594
This killed some 15% of patients, 
but for those who survived,

00:00:49.594 --> 00:00:51.254
it seemed to work.

00:00:51.254 --> 00:00:54.130
It actually became the standard treatment 
for syphilis

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.878
until penicillin 
was widely used decades later.

00:00:57.878 --> 00:01:01.428
And its driving force was fever.

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:03.708
There are many mysteries around fever,

00:01:03.708 --> 00:01:06.238
but what we do know is that all mammals,

00:01:06.238 --> 00:01:12.437
some birds and even a few invertebrate 
and plant species feel fever’s heat.

00:01:12.437 --> 00:01:16.507
It has persisted 
for over 600 million years of evolution.

00:01:16.507 --> 00:01:18.698
But it has a significant cost.

00:01:18.698 --> 00:01:23.158
For every 1 degree Celsius of temperature 
increase in the human body,

00:01:23.158 --> 00:01:27.965
there’s a 12.5 percent increase 
in energy required,

00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:32.035
the equivalent of about 20 minutes 
of jogging for some.

00:01:32.035 --> 00:01:36.781
So, why and how does your body 
produce a fever?

00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:40.901
Your core temperature is maintained 
via thermoregulation,

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:46.053
a set of processes that usually keep 
you around 37 degrees Celsius.

00:01:46.053 --> 00:01:49.713
These mechanisms are controlled 
by the brain’s hypothalamus,

00:01:49.713 --> 00:01:52.299
which detects minute temperature shifts

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.869
and sends signals 
throughout the body accordingly.

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.839
If you’re too hot, the hypothalamus 
produces signals

00:01:58.839 --> 00:02:03.399
that activate your sweat glands 
or make your blood vessels dilate,

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.639
moving blood closer 
to the skin’s surface—

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:10.259
all of which releases heat 
and cools you off.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.745
And if you’re too cold,

00:02:11.745 --> 00:02:15.525
your blood vessels will constrict 
and you may start to shiver,

00:02:15.525 --> 00:02:17.305
which generates heat.

00:02:17.305 --> 00:02:22.729
Your body will disrupt its usual 
temperature equilibrium to induce a fever,

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:26.329
which sets in above 38 degrees Celsius.

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:29.245
Meanwhile, it has mechanisms 
in place to prevent it

00:02:29.245 --> 00:02:34.462
from exceeding 41 degrees Celsius,
when organ damage could occur.

00:02:34.462 --> 00:02:38.182
Immune cells that are fighting 
an infection can induce a fever

00:02:38.182 --> 00:02:42.355
by triggering a biochemical cascade 
that ultimately instructs

00:02:42.355 --> 00:02:46.443
your hypothalamus to increase 
your baseline temperature.

00:02:46.443 --> 00:02:51.650
Your body then gets to work to meet 
its new “set point” using the mechanisms

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.810
it would to generate heat when cold.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.975
Until it reaches this new temperature, 
you’ll feel comparatively cool,

00:02:58.975 --> 00:03:02.065
which is why you might experience chills.

00:03:02.065 --> 00:03:04.065
But why does your body do this?

00:03:04.065 --> 00:03:09.078
While the jury's still out on how higher 
temperatures directly affect pathogens,

00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:11.658
it seems that fever's main effect

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:16.942
is in rapidly inducing a whole-body 
immune response.

00:03:16.942 --> 00:03:20.132
Upon exposure to raised 
internal temperatures,

00:03:20.132 --> 00:03:25.755
some of your cells release 
heat shock proteins, or HSPs,

00:03:25.755 --> 00:03:30.369
a family of molecules produced 
in response to stressful conditions.

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:36.027
These proteins aid lymphocytes, 
one of several kinds of white blood cells

00:03:36.027 --> 00:03:41.105
that fight pathogens, to travel 
more rapidly to infection sites.

00:03:41.105 --> 00:03:45.853
HSPs do this by enhancing 
the “stickiness” of lymphocytes,

00:03:45.853 --> 00:03:50.295
enabling them to adhere to and squeeze 
through blood vessel walls

00:03:50.295 --> 00:03:54.495
so they can reach the areas 
where infection is raging.

00:03:54.495 --> 00:03:56.465
In the case of viral infections,

00:03:56.465 --> 00:04:01.313
HSPs help tell nearby cells to dampen 
their protein production,

00:04:01.313 --> 00:04:04.003
which limits their ability to replicate.

00:04:04.003 --> 00:04:07.029
This stunts the virus’s spread 
because they depend on

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:10.742
their host’s replicative machinery 
to reproduce.

00:04:10.742 --> 00:04:15.506
It also protects surrounding cells 
from damage since some viruses spread

00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:20.051
by rupturing their host cells, which can 
lead to large-scale destruction,

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:24.728
the build-up of detritus, 
and potentially even organ damage.

00:04:24.728 --> 00:04:30.326
The ability of HSPs to protect host cells 
and enhance immune activity

00:04:30.326 --> 00:04:34.928
can limit the pathogen’s 
path of destruction inside of the body.

00:04:34.928 --> 00:04:39.248
But for all we know about fever’s role 
in immune activation,

00:04:39.248 --> 00:04:43.335
some clinical trials have shown 
that fever suppressor drugs

00:04:43.335 --> 00:04:46.562
don’t worsen symptoms or recovery rates.

00:04:46.562 --> 00:04:51.086
This is why there’s no definitive rule 
on whether to suppress a fever

00:04:51.086 --> 00:04:52.607
or let it ride.

00:04:52.607 --> 00:04:55.966
Doctors decide on a case-by-case basis.

00:04:55.966 --> 00:05:00.891
The fever’s duration and intensity, 
as well as their patient’s immune status,

00:05:00.891 --> 00:05:06.002
comfort level, and age will all play 
a role in their choice of treatments.

00:05:06.002 --> 00:05:08.342
And if they do let a fever ride,

00:05:08.342 --> 00:05:13.666
they’ll likely prescribe rest and plenty 
of fluids to prevent dehydration

00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:16.456
while the body wages its heated battle.
