00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:09.493
What shape are your cells?

00:00:09.493 --> 00:00:12.223
Squishy cylinders? Jagged zig-zags?

00:00:12.223 --> 00:00:15.863
You probably don’t think much about
the bodies of these building blocks,

00:00:15.863 --> 00:00:20.593
but at the microscopic level, small 
changes can have huge consequences.

00:00:20.593 --> 00:00:23.963
And while some adaptations change 
these shapes for the better,

00:00:23.963 --> 00:00:28.233
others can spark a cascade of 
debilitating complications.

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:31.260
This is the story of sickle-cell disease.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.060
Sickle-cell disease affects the 
red blood cells,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.060
which transport oxygen from the lungs 
to all the tissues in the body.

00:00:38.063 --> 00:00:39.733
To perform this vital task,

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:44.633
red blood cells are filled with hemoglobin
proteins to carry oxygen molecules.

00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:46.911
These proteins float independently

00:00:46.911 --> 00:00:50.671
inside the red blood cell’s pliable, 
doughnut-like shape,

00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:52.301
keeping the cells flexible enough

00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:55.641
to accommodate even the 
tiniest of blood vessels.

00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:57.245
But in sickle cell disease,

00:00:57.245 --> 00:01:01.385
a single genetic mutation alters
the structure of hemoglobin.

00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:03.915
After releasing oxygen to tissues,

00:01:03.915 --> 00:01:08.145
these mutated proteins lock 
together into rigid rows.

00:01:08.145 --> 00:01:13.878
Rods of hemoglobin cause the cell 
to deform into a long, pointed sickle.

00:01:13.878 --> 00:01:16.950
These red blood cells are 
harder and stickier,

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.880
and no longer flow smoothly through 
blood vessels.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.540
Sickled cells snag and pile up–

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.180
sometimes blocking the vessel completely.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.620
This keeps oxygen from reaching
a variety of cells,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.770
causing the wide range of symptoms

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.050
experienced by people 
with sickle-cell disease.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.290
Starting when they’re 
less than a year old,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.850
patients suffer from repeated episodes of
stabbing pain in oxygen-starved tissues.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.758
The location of the clogged vessel

00:01:43.758 --> 00:01:46.788
determines the specific 
symptoms experienced.

00:01:46.788 --> 00:01:49.608
A blockage in the spleen, 
part of the immune system,

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:52.908
puts patients at risk for 
dangerous infections.

00:01:52.908 --> 00:01:56.908
A pileup in the lungs can produce 
fevers and difficulty breathing.

00:01:56.908 --> 00:02:01.268
A clog near the eye can cause vision 
problems and retinal detachment.

00:02:01.268 --> 00:02:03.629
And if the obstructed vessels 
supply the brain

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:06.399
the patient could even 
suffer a stroke.

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.009
Worse still, sickled red blood cells 
also don’t survive very long—

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.338
just 10 or 20 days, versus a 
healthy cell’s 4 months.

00:02:15.338 --> 00:02:16.553
This short lifespan

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:20.913
means that patients live with a constantly
depleted supply of red blood cells;

00:02:20.913 --> 00:02:23.850
a condition called sickle-cell anemia.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.360
Perhaps what’s most surprising 
about this malignant mutation

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.240
is that it originally evolved
as a beneficial adaptation.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.240
Researchers have been able to trace
the origins of the sickle cell mutation

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.803
to regions historically ravaged 
by a tropical disease called malaria.

00:02:39.803 --> 00:02:42.791
Spread by a parasite found 
in local mosquitoes,

00:02:42.791 --> 00:02:46.201
malaria uses red blood cells as incubators

00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:49.381
to spread quickly and lethally 
through the bloodstream.

00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:54.351
However, the same structural changes
that turn red blood cells into roadblocks

00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:57.407
also make them more resistant to malaria.

00:02:57.407 --> 00:03:01.627
And if a child inherits a copy of the
mutation from only one parent,

00:03:01.627 --> 00:03:04.218
there will be just enough abnormal 
hemoglobin

00:03:04.218 --> 00:03:07.398
to make life difficult for the 
malaria parasite,

00:03:07.398 --> 00:03:11.308
while most of their red blood cells retain
their normal shape and function.

00:03:11.308 --> 00:03:13.418
In regions rife with this parasite,

00:03:13.418 --> 00:03:17.638
sickle cell mutation offered a serious 
evolutionary advantage.

00:03:17.638 --> 00:03:19.527
But as the adaptation flourished,

00:03:19.527 --> 00:03:23.217
it became clear that inheriting the 
mutation from both parents

00:03:23.217 --> 00:03:25.757
resulted in sickle-cell anemia.

00:03:25.757 --> 00:03:28.157
Today, most people with 
sickle-cell disease

00:03:28.157 --> 00:03:32.587
can trace their ancestry to a country
where malaria is endemic.

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:36.275
And this mutation still plays a key role
in Africa,

00:03:36.275 --> 00:03:40.715
where more than 90% of malaria 
infections occur worldwide.

00:03:40.715 --> 00:03:43.722
Fortunately, as this “adaptation” thrives,

00:03:43.722 --> 00:03:47.082
our treatment for sickle cell continues 
to improve.

00:03:47.082 --> 00:03:50.442
For years, hydroxyurea was the only 
medication available

00:03:50.442 --> 00:03:52.292
to reduce the amount of sickling,

00:03:52.292 --> 00:03:55.752
blunting symptoms and 
increasing life expectancy.

00:03:55.752 --> 00:03:59.002
Bone marrow transplantations 
offer a curative measure,

00:03:59.002 --> 00:04:03.002
but these procedures are 
complicated and often inaccessible.

00:04:03.002 --> 00:04:06.722
But promising new medications 
are intervening in novel ways,

00:04:06.722 --> 00:04:10.432
like keeping oxygen bonded to 
hemoglobin to prevent sickling,

00:04:10.432 --> 00:04:13.592
or reducing the stickiness 
of sickled cells.

00:04:13.592 --> 00:04:15.452
And the ability to edit DNA

00:04:15.452 --> 00:04:20.922
has raised the possibility of enabling 
stem cells to produce normal hemoglobin.

00:04:20.922 --> 00:04:22.575
As these tools become available

00:04:22.575 --> 00:04:26.575
in the areas most affected by malaria
and sickle cell disease,

00:04:26.575 --> 00:04:28.365
we can improve the quality of life

00:04:28.365 --> 00:04:32.365
for more patients with this 
adverse adaptation.
