00:00:12.937 --> 00:00:14.112
In the future,

00:00:14.136 --> 00:00:17.790
self-driving cars will be safer
and more reliable than humans.

00:00:18.175 --> 00:00:19.397
But for this to happen,

00:00:19.421 --> 00:00:22.151
we need technologies
that allow cars to respond

00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:23.442
faster than humans,

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:27.180
we need algorithms
that can drive better than humans

00:00:27.204 --> 00:00:31.307
and we need cameras
that can see more than humans can see.

00:00:32.061 --> 00:00:36.791
For example, imagine a self-driving car
is about to make a blind turn,

00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:38.149
and there's an oncoming car

00:00:38.173 --> 00:00:40.958
or perhaps there's a child
about to run into the street.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:45.022
Fortunately, our future car
will have this superpower,

00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:49.145
a camera that can see around corners
to detect these potential hazards.

00:00:49.876 --> 00:00:51.955
For the past few years as a PhD student

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:54.256
in the Stanford Computational Imaging Lab,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.034
I've been working on a camera
that can do just this --

00:00:57.058 --> 00:01:00.456
a camera that can image objects
hidden around corners

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.252
or blocked from direct line of sight.

00:01:03.276 --> 00:01:06.728
So let me give you an example
of what our camera can see.

00:01:06.752 --> 00:01:09.315
This is an outdoor experiment we conducted

00:01:09.339 --> 00:01:13.149
where our camera system is scanning
the side of this building with a laser,

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:15.133
and the scene that we want to capture

00:01:15.157 --> 00:01:18.117
is hidden around the corner
behind this curtain.

00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:21.118
So our camera system
can't actually see it directly.

00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:22.729
And yet, somehow,

00:01:22.753 --> 00:01:27.301
our camera can still capture
the 3D geometry of this scene.

00:01:27.704 --> 00:01:29.104
So how do we do this?

00:01:29.498 --> 00:01:32.220
The magic happens here
in this camera system.

00:01:32.244 --> 00:01:35.569
You can think of this
as a type of high-speed camera.

00:01:35.593 --> 00:01:39.063
Not one that operates
at 1,000 frames per second,

00:01:39.087 --> 00:01:41.832
or even a million frames per second,

00:01:41.856 --> 00:01:44.109
but a trillion frames per second.

00:01:45.023 --> 00:01:49.858
So fast that it can actually capture
the movement of light itself.

00:01:50.652 --> 00:01:54.295
And to give you an example
of just how fast light travels,

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.604
let's compare it to the speed
of a fast-running comic book superhero

00:01:58.628 --> 00:02:01.376
who can move at up to three times
the speed of sound.

00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:06.400
It takes a pulse of light
about 3.3 billionths of a second,

00:02:06.424 --> 00:02:08.297
or 3.3 nanoseconds,

00:02:08.321 --> 00:02:10.450
to travel the distance of a meter.

00:02:10.474 --> 00:02:12.409
Well, in that same time,

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:16.307
our superhero has moved
less than the width of a human hair.

00:02:16.633 --> 00:02:17.900
That's pretty fast.

00:02:18.306 --> 00:02:20.760
But actually, we need to image much faster

00:02:20.784 --> 00:02:24.172
if we want to capture light
moving at subcentimeter scales.

00:02:24.784 --> 00:02:27.281
So our camera system can capture photons

00:02:27.305 --> 00:02:30.821
at time frames of just
50 trillionths of a second,

00:02:30.845 --> 00:02:32.590
or 50 picoseconds.

00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:36.323
So we take this ultra-high-speed camera

00:02:36.347 --> 00:02:40.021
and we pair it with a laser
that sends out short pulses of light.

00:02:40.553 --> 00:02:43.188
Each pulse travels to this visible wall

00:02:43.212 --> 00:02:45.339
and some light scatters
back to our camera,

00:02:45.363 --> 00:02:48.579
but we also use the wall
to scatter light around the corner

00:02:48.603 --> 00:02:50.536
to the hidden object and back.

00:02:51.363 --> 00:02:53.601
We repeat this measurement many times

00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:56.165
to capture the arrival times
of many photons

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.276
from different locations on the wall.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.156
And after we capture
these measurements, we can create

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.815
a trillion-frame-per-second
video of the wall.

00:03:04.371 --> 00:03:07.379
While this wall may look
ordinary to our own eyes,

00:03:07.403 --> 00:03:11.878
at a trillion frames per second,
we can see something truly incredible.

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:16.642
We can actually see waves of light
scattered back from the hidden scene

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:18.733
and splashing against the wall.

00:03:19.063 --> 00:03:22.015
And each of these waves
carries information

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:24.317
about the hidden object that sent it.

00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:26.022
So we can take these measurements

00:03:26.046 --> 00:03:28.545
and pass them into
a reconstruction algorithm

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.450
to then recover the 3D geometry
of this hidden scene.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:37.189
Now I want to show you one more example
of an indoor scene that we captured,

00:03:37.213 --> 00:03:40.323
this time with a variety
of different hidden objects.

00:03:40.347 --> 00:03:42.474
And these objects
have different appearances,

00:03:42.498 --> 00:03:44.331
so they reflect light differently.

00:03:44.355 --> 00:03:48.109
For example, this glossy dragon statue
reflects light differently

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:49.910
than the mirror disco ball

00:03:49.934 --> 00:03:52.545
or the white discus thrower statue.

00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:56.417
And we can actually see the differences
in the reflected light

00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:59.282
by visualizing it as this 3D volume,

00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:02.616
where we've just taken the video frames
and stacked them together.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.939
And time here is represented
as the depth dimension of this cube.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:11.105
These bright dots that you see
are reflections of light

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.675
from each of the mirrored
facets of the disco ball,

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:15.890
scattering against the wall over time.

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:19.958
The bright streaks of light that you see
arriving soonest in time

00:04:19.982 --> 00:04:23.942
are from the glossy dragon statue
that's closest to the wall,

00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:27.767
and the other streaks of light come from
reflections of light from the bookcase

00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:29.124
and from the statue.

00:04:29.727 --> 00:04:33.614
Now, we can also visualize
these measurements frame by frame,

00:04:33.638 --> 00:04:34.830
as a video,

00:04:34.854 --> 00:04:36.736
to directly see the scattered light.

00:04:37.461 --> 00:04:41.080
And again, here we see, first,
reflections of light from the dragon,

00:04:41.104 --> 00:04:42.350
closest to the wall,

00:04:42.374 --> 00:04:45.763
followed by bright dots
from the disco ball

00:04:45.787 --> 00:04:48.506
and other reflections from the bookcase.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.982
And finally, we see the reflected
waves of light from the statue.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.633
These waves of light illuminating the wall

00:04:56.657 --> 00:05:01.275
are like fireworks that last
for just trillionths of a second.

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:08.895
And even though these objects
reflect light differently,

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.553
we can still reconstruct their shapes.

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:14.337
And this is what you can see
from around the corner.

00:05:15.547 --> 00:05:18.976
Now, I want to show you one more example
that's slightly different.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.380
In this video, you see me
dressed in this reflective suit

00:05:22.404 --> 00:05:26.799
and our camera system is scanning the wall
at a rate of four times every second.

00:05:27.173 --> 00:05:28.387
The suit is reflective,

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:31.069
so we can actually capture enough photons

00:05:31.093 --> 00:05:34.641
that we can see where I am
and what I'm doing,

00:05:34.665 --> 00:05:37.562
without the camera
actually directly imaging me.

00:05:37.586 --> 00:05:42.125
By capturing photons that scatter
from the wall to my tracksuit,

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:44.283
back to the wall and back to the camera,

00:05:44.307 --> 00:05:47.903
we can capture this indirect
video in real time.

00:05:48.954 --> 00:05:52.160
And we think that this type
of practical non-line-of-sight imaging

00:05:52.184 --> 00:05:55.910
could be useful for applications
including for self-driving cars,

00:05:55.934 --> 00:05:58.029
but also for biomedical imaging,

00:05:58.053 --> 00:06:01.624
where we need to see
into the tiny structures of the body.

00:06:01.974 --> 00:06:05.475
And perhaps we could also put
similar camera systems on the robots

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:08.164
that we send to explore other planets.

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:11.601
Now you may have heard
about seeing around corners before,

00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:14.199
but what I showed you today
would have been impossible

00:06:14.223 --> 00:06:15.387
just two years ago.

00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:19.268
For example, we can now image large,
room-sized hidden scenes outdoors

00:06:19.292 --> 00:06:21.141
and at real-time rates,

00:06:21.165 --> 00:06:25.522
and we've made significant advancements
towards making this a practical technology

00:06:25.546 --> 00:06:27.839
that you could actually see
on a car someday.

00:06:28.156 --> 00:06:30.736
But of course, there's still
challenges remaining.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.823
For example, can we image
hidden scenes at long distances

00:06:34.847 --> 00:06:37.990
where we're collecting
very, very few photons,

00:06:38.014 --> 00:06:41.291
with lasers that are low-power
and that are eye-safe.

00:06:41.641 --> 00:06:43.976
Or can we create images from photons

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.029
that have scattered around many more times

00:06:46.053 --> 00:06:48.656
than just a single bounce
around the corner?

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.323
Can we take our prototype system
that's, well, currently large and bulky,

00:06:53.347 --> 00:06:55.887
and miniaturize it into something
that could be useful

00:06:55.911 --> 00:06:57.110
for biomedical imaging

00:06:57.134 --> 00:07:00.220
or perhaps a sort of improved
home-security system,

00:07:00.244 --> 00:07:05.756
or can we take this new imaging modality
and use it for other applications?

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.669
I think it's an exciting new technology

00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:10.621
and there could be other things
that we haven't thought of yet

00:07:10.645 --> 00:07:11.819
to use it for.

00:07:11.843 --> 00:07:14.388
And so, well, a future
with self-driving cars

00:07:14.412 --> 00:07:16.578
may seem distant to us now --

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:18.579
we're already developing the technologies

00:07:18.603 --> 00:07:21.150
that could make cars safer
and more intelligent.

00:07:21.698 --> 00:07:25.000
And with the rapid pace
of scientific discovery and innovation,

00:07:25.024 --> 00:07:28.071
you never know what new
and exciting capabilities

00:07:28.095 --> 00:07:30.229
could be just around the corner.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.730
(Applause)
