00:00:06.771 --> 00:00:09.831
It was a normal Tuesday 
at the superconductor,

00:00:09.831 --> 00:00:14.161
until a bug in the system created 
a small situation.

00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:18.900
Now your team is trapped in eleven 
separate pocket dimensions.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.380
Luckily for you, there’s a half-finished 
experimental teleportation robot

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.718
that may be able to get you all home,

00:00:26.718 --> 00:00:30.838
if you can figure out how to work through
the quirks of its design.

00:00:30.838 --> 00:00:32.740
Over interdimensional radio,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.030
your engineers explain

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.160
that the robot can teleport into the 
alternate universes you’re trapped in,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.130
but it’ll do so completely at random.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.770
The robot has two levers 
and one big button.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.800
When it appears,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.010
you just switch the position of one 
of the levers from A to B or vice versa,

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.090
and then the robot will note your 
dimensional position

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.910
and teleport to another of the eleven 
dimensions at random.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.880
If it shows up again, you’ll have to pull 
a lever before it’ll teleport away.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.060
When anyone presses the button,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.010
the robot will bring everyone who pulled
a lever back home.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.781
Anyone who didn’t will be lost 
in the multi-verse forever.

00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:18.361
The challenge is to make sure everyone
has pulled a lever

00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:20.891
before anyone hits the button.

00:01:20.891 --> 00:01:24.501
While you can talk to each other now
over the interdimensional radio

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:25.921
and agree on a plan,

00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:28.431
the robot’s teleportation technology

00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:32.801
will interfere with all attempts 
at communication once it arrives.

00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:35.709
You won’t be able to attach messages 
to the robot

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:39.759
or scratch notes into its superstrong
alloy body.

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.539
Your only way to communicate information

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.189
is to change the position of exactly 
one lever or hit the button.

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.749
What plan will make sure 
everyone gets home?

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:55.024
Pause the video now if you want to
figure it out for yourself.

00:01:55.024 --> 00:01:56.026
Answer in 3

00:01:56.026 --> 00:01:57.817
Answer in 2

00:01:57.817 --> 00:01:59.349
Answer in 1

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:03.029
It would be nice if you could set 
different combinations of the levers

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:05.893
to indicate who’s already 
been visited by the robot.

00:02:05.893 --> 00:02:08.643
But it has only two levers.

00:02:08.643 --> 00:02:10.683
That gives four combinations—

00:02:10.683 --> 00:02:13.673
far too few to communicate 
about 11 people,

00:02:13.673 --> 00:02:18.763
especially when you’re forced to flip 
one to send the robot onward.

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:20.472
There must be another way.

00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:23.492
The critical insight is that not
everyone has to know

00:02:23.492 --> 00:02:26.132
when every pocket dimension
has been visited.

00:02:26.132 --> 00:02:30.242
If one person accepts responsibility 
ahead of time for hitting the button,

00:02:30.242 --> 00:02:33.582
then only they need to know who the robot
has visited.

00:02:33.582 --> 00:02:37.872
In fact, they don’t even need to know 
exactly who’s been visited…

00:02:37.872 --> 00:02:39.872
just how many people have been.

00:02:39.872 --> 00:02:43.982
You volunteer to be the person in charge 
of pressing the button

00:02:43.982 --> 00:02:45.442
when the moment is right,

00:02:45.442 --> 00:02:48.842
and give the following directions
to everyone else.

00:02:48.842 --> 00:02:50.392
Your plan is simple:

00:02:50.392 --> 00:02:53.102
you’ll use the left lever to count visits,

00:02:53.102 --> 00:02:55.522
and the right lever will have no meaning,

00:02:55.522 --> 00:02:58.662
so there’s no harm in 
moving it up or down.

00:02:58.662 --> 00:03:00.892
Each of the others will pull the left
lever

00:03:00.892 --> 00:03:05.282
from position A to position 
B exactly once.

00:03:05.282 --> 00:03:09.160
If the robot appears with the left lever
already pulled down,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.970
or if an individual has previously pulled
the left lever down

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.790
at any point in the past,

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.910
then they should move the right lever.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.400
You, meanwhile, will be the only one who 
ever resets the left lever from position B

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.152
to position A.

00:03:24.152 --> 00:03:28.392
This gives you a way to count how many 
people have been visited by the robot.

00:03:28.396 --> 00:03:32.126
Everyone needs to pull the left lever 
down exactly once,

00:03:32.126 --> 00:03:35.066
and you’re the only one 
to pull it back up.

00:03:35.066 --> 00:03:38.156
So you know that the tenth time 
the robot visits you

00:03:38.156 --> 00:03:40.716
with its left lever in the down position,

00:03:40.716 --> 00:03:43.876
it must have visited 
all ten of the others.

00:03:43.876 --> 00:03:48.766
And that means you’re safe to press the 
button and teleport everyone home.

00:03:48.766 --> 00:03:49.906
It may take a while–

00:03:49.906 --> 00:03:55.596
most likely the robot will need to 
teleport around 355 times;

00:03:55.596 --> 00:03:58.595
but better that than leave anyone behind.

00:03:58.595 --> 00:04:02.765
Your teammates phase back into your home
dimension one at a time.

00:04:02.765 --> 00:04:05.127
The mission proves a great success.

00:04:05.127 --> 00:04:07.317
Well...mostly.
