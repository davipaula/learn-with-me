00:00:14.068 --> 00:00:16.368
If humans could fly,

00:00:16.392 --> 00:00:17.819
without tools and machines,

00:00:17.843 --> 00:00:20.102
how fast do you think we would go?

00:00:20.126 --> 00:00:22.509
As of 2012, the world record

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.606
for fastest short-distance sprint speed

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.339
is roughly 27 miles per hour.

00:00:27.363 --> 00:00:29.236
Running speed depends on how much force

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.114
is exerted by the runner's legs,

00:00:31.138 --> 00:00:34.341
and according to Newton's Second
Law of Motion,

00:00:34.365 --> 00:00:38.580
force is the product of mass
times acceleration.

00:00:38.604 --> 00:00:40.346
And Newton's Third Law states

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.623
that for every action,

00:00:41.647 --> 00:00:44.759
there is an equal and opposite reaction.

00:00:44.783 --> 00:00:46.744
So, that means running requires

00:00:46.768 --> 00:00:48.546
having a ground to push off from,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.679
and the ground pushes back
against the runner's foot.

00:00:52.703 --> 00:00:55.210
So, flying would actually be

00:00:55.234 --> 00:00:57.390
more similar to swimming.

00:00:57.414 --> 00:01:01.317
Michael Phelps is currently
the fastest human in water

00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:04.964
and the most decorated
Olympian of all time.

00:01:04.988 --> 00:01:06.690
Guess how fast he swims?

00:01:06.714 --> 00:01:09.359
The answer may surprise you.

00:01:09.383 --> 00:01:11.236
His fastest recorded speed is

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.089
less than 5 miles per hour.

00:01:15.113 --> 00:01:17.368
A child on the ground can easily outrun

00:01:17.392 --> 00:01:18.660
Michael Phelps in water,

00:01:18.684 --> 00:01:20.537
but why is that?

00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:23.224
Well, let's go back
to Newton's Third Law of Motion.

00:01:23.248 --> 00:01:24.792
When we run, we move forward

00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:27.087
by pushing against the ground
with our feet

00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:28.397
and the ground pushes back,

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:30.388
propelling us forward.

00:01:30.412 --> 00:01:32.591
The ground is solid.

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:34.846
By definition, it means the particles

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.181
are essentially locked into place

00:01:37.205 --> 00:01:40.431
and must push back instead
of getting out of the way,

00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:43.644
but water is liquid and flows easily.

00:01:43.668 --> 00:01:44.730
When we move our limbs

00:01:44.754 --> 00:01:46.231
to push back against the water,

00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:47.636
a part of the water molecules

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.403
can just slide past one another

00:01:49.427 --> 00:01:50.894
instead of pushing back.

00:01:50.918 --> 00:01:52.528
Now, let's think about flying.

00:01:52.552 --> 00:01:54.448
Air has a lot more free space

00:01:54.472 --> 00:01:56.863
for particles to move past one another,

00:01:56.887 --> 00:01:59.910
so even more of our energy
would be wasted.

00:01:59.934 --> 00:02:02.176
We would need to push
a lot of air backwards

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.977
in order to move forward.

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:05.833
Astronauts move around in shuttles

00:02:05.857 --> 00:02:07.905
in zero gravity when
they're in outer space

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.915
by pulling on handles installed
on the ceiling walls

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:12.644
and floors of the shuttle.

00:02:12.668 --> 00:02:16.470
Now, imagine you were
given the ability to float.

00:02:16.494 --> 00:02:19.263
How would you move
around in the middle of the street?

00:02:19.287 --> 00:02:20.764
Well, you wouldn't get very far

00:02:20.788 --> 00:02:23.036
by swimming in air, would you?

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.385
Nah, I don't think so!

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.979
Now, assuming you were
granted the ability to float

00:02:27.003 --> 00:02:29.733
and the speed to move around efficiently,

00:02:29.757 --> 00:02:32.600
let's discuss the height of your flight.

00:02:32.624 --> 00:02:34.778
According to the Ideal Gas Law,

00:02:34.802 --> 00:02:36.322
P-V N-R-T,

00:02:36.346 --> 00:02:38.823
pressure and temperature has
a positive correlation,

00:02:38.847 --> 00:02:42.203
meaning they increase
and decrease together.

00:02:42.227 --> 00:02:44.497
This is because the air expands in volume

00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:45.815
with less pressure,

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:48.247
so the molecules have more
room to wander around

00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:51.920
without colliding into each other
and creating heat.

00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:54.087
Since the atmospheric
pressure is a lot lower

00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:55.306
in high altitudes,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.866
it would be freezing cold

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.644
if you were flying above the clouds.

00:02:58.668 --> 00:03:00.097
You'd need to wrap yourself up

00:03:00.121 --> 00:03:01.741
to keep your core body temperature

00:03:01.765 --> 00:03:03.566
above 95 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.436
otherwise you'd start shivering violently,

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.145
gradually becoming mentally confused

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:09.789
and eventually drop out of the sky

00:03:09.813 --> 00:03:10.925
due to loss of muscle control

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:13.179
from hypothermia!

00:03:14.272 --> 00:03:16.197
Now, the Ideal Gas Law implies

00:03:16.221 --> 00:03:17.903
that as the pressure decreases,

00:03:17.927 --> 00:03:19.732
gas volume increases.

00:03:19.756 --> 00:03:21.995
So, if you were to fly
straight up too quickly,

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.596
the inert gas in your body
would rapidly expand

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.433
the way soda fizzes up when shaken.

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:30.008
The phenomenon is called "the bends,"

00:03:30.032 --> 00:03:31.161
decompression sickness,

00:03:31.185 --> 00:03:32.873
or "divers disease"

00:03:32.897 --> 00:03:35.580
since deep sea scuba
divers experience this

00:03:35.604 --> 00:03:37.523
when they come up too quickly.

00:03:37.547 --> 00:03:39.379
This results in pain,

00:03:39.403 --> 00:03:40.379
paralysis,

00:03:40.403 --> 00:03:41.606
or death,

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.641
depending on how foamy your blood becomes.

00:03:44.665 --> 00:03:46.342
Okay, well, let's say you want to fly

00:03:46.366 --> 00:03:47.986
just a few meters above the ground

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.820
where you can still see the road signs

00:03:49.844 --> 00:03:51.306
and breath oxygen with ease.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.346
You'll still need goggles and a helmet

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.980
to protect you from birds,

00:03:55.004 --> 00:03:55.953
insects,

00:03:55.977 --> 00:03:56.757
street signs,

00:03:56.781 --> 00:03:57.693
electrical wires,

00:03:57.717 --> 00:03:59.550
and other flying humans,

00:03:59.574 --> 00:04:01.150
including flying cops

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:02.319
ready to hand you a ticket

00:04:02.343 --> 00:04:04.528
if you don't follow
the flying rules, buddy.

00:04:04.552 --> 00:04:07.025
Now remember, if you
have a collision mid-air

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.941
that knocks you unconscious,

00:04:08.965 --> 00:04:11.050
you would experience free fall

00:04:11.074 --> 00:04:12.933
until you hit the ground.

00:04:14.674 --> 00:04:17.551
Without society or the laws of physics,

00:04:17.575 --> 00:04:20.960
flying would be a totally
awesome ability to have.

00:04:20.984 --> 00:04:22.775
But, even if we could
all just float around

00:04:22.799 --> 00:04:23.757
a few feet above the ground

00:04:23.781 --> 00:04:25.465
and only moving at a snail's pace,

00:04:25.489 --> 00:04:28.992
I'm telling you, it's still
a cool ability that I'd want,

00:04:29.016 --> 00:04:30.738
wouldn't you?

00:04:30.762 --> 00:04:32.892
Yeah, I thought so.

00:04:32.916 --> 00:04:35.392
Now, which superpower physics lesson

00:04:35.416 --> 00:04:37.779
will you explore next?

00:04:37.803 --> 00:04:42.043
Shifting body size and content,

00:04:42.067 --> 00:04:43.401
super speed,

00:04:43.425 --> 00:04:45.024
flight,

00:04:45.048 --> 00:04:47.972
super strength,

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:50.658
immortality,

00:04:50.682 --> 00:04:52.216
and

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.910
invisibility.
