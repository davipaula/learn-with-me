00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.770
We've got a big problem on our hands
with global warming.

00:00:16.794 --> 00:00:21.815
A lot of you, a lot of people
have been watching the floods,

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.239
the droughts, the storms, the fires.

00:00:26.712 --> 00:00:30.434
When I leave this stage today,
I don't want you to have hope.

00:00:32.053 --> 00:00:36.053
I want you to have certainty,
real certainty

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:40.529
that we can make a dent
in this problem and live to see it.

00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:45.387
I want to give you a vision
of what that would look like.

00:00:46.736 --> 00:00:49.768
This is the first time
we've shared this publicly.

00:00:50.498 --> 00:00:52.720
You're the first audience to hear it.

00:00:54.204 --> 00:00:56.585
We are going to launch a rocket.

00:00:57.347 --> 00:00:59.260
And on that rocket will be a satellite.

00:00:59.284 --> 00:01:02.766
And that satellite will collect
data about pollution

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.590
that is warming the planet.

00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:08.442
We will put that data
in the hands of people

00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:12.125
who can make simple fixes

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.144
that will change the course
of global warming in our lifetime.

00:01:17.592 --> 00:01:21.219
That's a lot to take in,
maybe I should back up.

00:01:21.626 --> 00:01:23.612
First, let me introduce myself, I'm Fred,

00:01:23.636 --> 00:01:26.072
I've been an environmentalist
since I was a kid,

00:01:26.096 --> 00:01:29.611
when I watched the fish and the frogs
in my neighborhood pond

00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:31.369
die from a chemical spill.

00:01:32.673 --> 00:01:33.940
That bothered me.

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:40.778
Later, a professor inspired me to think
about environmentalism differently.

00:01:41.542 --> 00:01:44.836
How the best solutions come from

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.566
answering people's aspirations
for prosperity,

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.874
things like being safe and healthy
and thriving in this world.

00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:58.345
So I joined the Environmental Defense Fund
to build those kind of solutions.

00:01:59.296 --> 00:02:03.875
And I've worked my whole career
for a moment like this --

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.593
the moment, when we can stop
fighting headwinds

00:02:07.617 --> 00:02:10.284
and start to have the wind at our backs.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.617
Because of the power of information,

00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:15.950
information from technology

00:02:15.974 --> 00:02:19.390
that is coming down in price
and going up in precision.

00:02:21.014 --> 00:02:24.815
You see, there's something
about climate change that we didn't grasp

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:26.188
just a decade ago.

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:30.947
The world was so focused on carbon dioxide

00:02:30.971 --> 00:02:34.288
that we overlooked another important gas.

00:02:34.312 --> 00:02:36.245
We didn't appreciate methane.

00:02:37.236 --> 00:02:40.283
Methane pollution causes one quarter
of the global warming

00:02:40.307 --> 00:02:42.574
that we're experiencing right now.

00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:48.318
Pound for pound, its immediate impact
is far greater than carbon dioxide.

00:02:49.173 --> 00:02:53.797
Eighty four times greater
over a 20-year period.

00:02:56.022 --> 00:02:58.594
One of the largest sources
of methane pollution

00:02:58.618 --> 00:03:00.485
is the oil and gas industry.

00:03:01.038 --> 00:03:04.638
But that's not obvious,
because methane is invisible.

00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:08.299
Let's take a look
at this natural gas storage facility

00:03:08.323 --> 00:03:10.053
outside of Los Angeles.

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:12.257
Can you see the methane?

00:03:14.022 --> 00:03:15.172
Neither can I.

00:03:15.783 --> 00:03:16.933
How about now?

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.672
We shot this using an infrared camera,
at the same spot,

00:03:21.696 --> 00:03:26.256
exposing one of the worst methane leaks
in the history of the United States.

00:03:26.847 --> 00:03:28.823
That's a very different picture.

00:03:29.251 --> 00:03:33.910
It turns out that natural gas
is displacing our dependence on coal,

00:03:33.934 --> 00:03:36.672
which emits far more carbon dioxide.

00:03:37.466 --> 00:03:39.847
But natural gas is mostly methane.

00:03:40.427 --> 00:03:42.967
So, as it's produced and processed

00:03:42.991 --> 00:03:47.538
and transported to homes
and businesses across America,

00:03:47.562 --> 00:03:53.067
it escapes from wells and pipes
and other equipment.

00:03:53.435 --> 00:03:56.213
It gets up into the sky and contributes

00:03:56.237 --> 00:03:59.304
to the disasters
that we're now experiencing.

00:04:00.467 --> 00:04:02.467
That does not have to happen.

00:04:03.712 --> 00:04:05.728
But nobody had paid much attention to it

00:04:05.752 --> 00:04:09.489
until we launched a nationwide study
to understand the problem.

00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:16.513
We used drones, planes, helicopters,
even Google Street View cars.

00:04:16.537 --> 00:04:19.934
It turns out there's far more
of this methane pollution

00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.991
than what the government is reporting.

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:29.488
It also turns out that when we find
where the gas is being vented and leaked,

00:04:29.512 --> 00:04:33.656
most of those sources can be fixed
easily and inexpensively,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.280
saving the gas that would have
otherwise been wasted.

00:04:38.116 --> 00:04:43.299
And finally, we learn that when you put
information like that into people's hands,

00:04:43.323 --> 00:04:44.473
they act.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.815
Leading companies replaced valves
and tightened loose-fitting pipes.

00:04:50.393 --> 00:04:54.649
Colorado became the first state
in the nation to limit methane pollution;

00:04:54.673 --> 00:04:58.073
California followed suit,
and the public joined in.

00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:03.499
Tweets started flying -- #cutmethane.

00:05:04.825 --> 00:05:07.625
And everybody's paying more attention now.

00:05:09.094 --> 00:05:15.552
We're doing this because we can't wait
for Washington, especially not now.

00:05:16.847 --> 00:05:22.220
In fact, we have to take
what we've done so far

00:05:22.244 --> 00:05:24.283
and go higher, to the sky.

00:05:25.371 --> 00:05:29.752
The United Stated represents
about 10 percent of this pollution.

00:05:30.308 --> 00:05:32.908
To find the rest, we have to go global.

00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:35.616
Remember that rocket I mentioned?

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.077
It will launch a compact satellite,
called MethaneSAT,

00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:43.085
to do what no one
has been able to do until now:

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:48.212
measure methane pollution
from oil and gas facilities worldwide,

00:05:48.236 --> 00:05:50.116
with exacting precision.

00:05:50.664 --> 00:05:54.156
Its data stream will allow us
to map that pollution,

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.047
so that everyone can see it.

00:05:56.712 --> 00:05:59.093
Then it's all about
turning data into action,

00:05:59.117 --> 00:06:01.489
just as we did in the United States.

00:06:01.513 --> 00:06:06.728
We've seen that when we present
companies with data,

00:06:06.752 --> 00:06:09.152
many of them will cut the pollution.

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.434
Citizens will be empowered to take action;

00:06:13.458 --> 00:06:16.258
governments will tighten the regulations.

00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:21.149
And because all of our data
will be free and public,

00:06:21.173 --> 00:06:22.554
there will be transparency --

00:06:22.578 --> 00:06:27.023
we'll all be able to see how much progress
is being made and where.

00:06:27.609 --> 00:06:29.450
Which brings me to our goal:

00:06:29.474 --> 00:06:34.720
to cut this methane pollution
by 45 percent by 2025.

00:06:35.526 --> 00:06:42.363
(Applause)

00:06:42.387 --> 00:06:45.982
That will have the same near-term impact

00:06:46.006 --> 00:06:50.426
as shutting down
1,300 coal-fired power plants.

00:06:51.482 --> 00:06:55.548
That's one third of all
the coal-fired power plants in the world.

00:06:55.997 --> 00:07:00.983
Nothing else can have this sort of
near-term impact at such a low cost.

00:07:02.302 --> 00:07:04.945
The fact that a single satellite

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:09.655
can help us put the brakes
on global warming is truly remarkable.

00:07:10.482 --> 00:07:14.823
This is our chance to create
change in our lifetimes,

00:07:14.847 --> 00:07:16.743
and we can do it now.

00:07:17.648 --> 00:07:20.482
Thanks to the generous giving
of the Audacious Project,

00:07:20.506 --> 00:07:22.706
we are on a path toward liftoff.

00:07:23.665 --> 00:07:27.641
But my time is running short,
and I promised you a vision

00:07:27.665 --> 00:07:30.738
of what a critical piece
of the solution would look like.

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:33.894
Can you see it?

00:07:35.378 --> 00:07:37.426
Can you see how this satellite leverages

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:41.002
the best of science
and data and technology?

00:07:42.252 --> 00:07:45.482
Can you see we're entering
a whole new era of innovation

00:07:45.506 --> 00:07:47.572
that is supercharging progress?

00:07:47.998 --> 00:07:50.331
Can you see that it's in our hands?

00:07:51.752 --> 00:07:55.291
We've set an aggressive goal
of three years till liftoff,

00:07:55.315 --> 00:07:59.198
and when that satellite is ready,
we'll have a launch party.

00:08:00.284 --> 00:08:01.817
A literal launch party.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:08.375
So imagine a blue-sky day,
crowds of people,

00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:10.299
television cameras,

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.856
kids staring up toward the sky

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.303
at a thing that
will change their future.

00:08:16.117 --> 00:08:18.317
What an amazing day that will be.

00:08:18.752 --> 00:08:20.819
What a big opportunity we have.

00:08:21.514 --> 00:08:22.664
I can't wait.

00:08:23.037 --> 00:08:24.188
Thank you.

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:29.619
(Applause)
