00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:08.670
Tattoos have often been presented

00:00:08.693 --> 00:00:12.702
in popular media as either marks
of the dangerous and deviant

00:00:12.726 --> 00:00:14.663
or trendy youth fads.

00:00:14.687 --> 00:00:17.001
But while tattoo styles come and go,

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:19.743
and their meaning has differed
greatly across cultures,

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:23.088
the practice is as old
as civilization itself.

00:00:23.868 --> 00:00:27.365
Decorative skin markings have
been discovered in human remains

00:00:27.389 --> 00:00:28.899
all over the world,

00:00:28.923 --> 00:00:34.260
with the oldest found on a Peruvian
mummy dating back to 6,000 BCE.

00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:37.739
But have you ever wondered
how tattooing really works?

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.911
You may know that we shed our skin,

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:44.349
losing about 30-40,000
skin cells per hour.

00:00:44.373 --> 00:00:45.985
That's about 1,000,000 per day.

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.463
So, how come the tattoo doesn't
gradually flake off along with them?

00:00:51.487 --> 00:00:54.238
The simple answer
is that tattooing involves

00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:56.499
getting pigment deeper into the skin

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:58.654
than the outermost layer that gets shed.

00:00:59.287 --> 00:01:01.550
Throughout history, different cultures

00:01:01.574 --> 00:01:03.760
have used various methods
to accomplish this.

00:01:03.784 --> 00:01:05.977
But the first modern tattooing machine

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:09.374
was modeled after Thomas Edison's
engraving machine

00:01:09.398 --> 00:01:10.614
and ran on electricity.

00:01:11.532 --> 00:01:13.427
Tattooing machines used today

00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:17.303
insert tiny needles,
loaded with dye, into the skin

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:20.655
at a frequency of 50
to 3,000 times per minute.

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:23.347
The needles punch through the epidermis,

00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:26.947
allowing ink to seep deep into the dermis,

00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:32.828
which is composed of collagen fibers,
nerves, glands, blood vessels and more.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.691
Every time a needle
penetrates, it causes a wound

00:01:36.715 --> 00:01:40.079
that alerts the body to begin
the inflammatory process,

00:01:40.103 --> 00:01:42.837
calling immune system cells
to the wound site

00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:44.356
to begin repairing the skin.

00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:48.064
And it is this very process
that makes tattoos permanent.

00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:51.740
First, specialized cells
called macrophages

00:01:51.764 --> 00:01:57.028
eat the invading material in an attempt
to clean up the inflammatory mess.

00:01:57.052 --> 00:01:59.685
As these cells travel
through the lymphatic system,

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.987
some of them are carried back with a belly
full of dye into the lymph nodes

00:02:04.011 --> 00:02:06.950
while others remain in the dermis.

00:02:06.974 --> 00:02:08.877
With no way to dispose of the pigment,

00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:11.730
the dyes inside them remain
visible through the skin.

00:02:12.245 --> 00:02:14.722
Some of the ink particles
are also suspended

00:02:14.746 --> 00:02:17.053
in the gel-like matrix of the dermis,

00:02:17.077 --> 00:02:21.379
while others are engulfed
by dermal cells called fibroblasts.

00:02:22.053 --> 00:02:25.613
Initially, ink is deposited
into the epidermis as well,

00:02:25.637 --> 00:02:29.390
but as the skin heals, the damaged
epidermal cells are shed

00:02:29.414 --> 00:02:32.267
and replaced by new, dye-free cells

00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:35.522
with the topmost layer peeling
off like a heeling sunburn.

00:02:35.546 --> 00:02:39.564
Blistering or crusting is not typically
seen with professional tattoos

00:02:39.588 --> 00:02:43.739
and complete epidermal
regeneration requires 2-4 weeks,

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:46.226
during which excess
sun exposure and swimming

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.229
should be avoided to prevent fading.

00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:52.541
Dermal cells, however,
remain in place until they die.

00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:57.306
When they do, they are taken up,
ink and all, by younger cells nearby,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.230
so the ink stays where it is.

00:02:59.254 --> 00:03:01.837
But with time, tattoos do fade naturally

00:03:01.861 --> 00:03:05.192
as the body reacts
to the alien pigment particles,

00:03:05.216 --> 00:03:07.490
slowly breaking them down
to be carried off

00:03:07.514 --> 00:03:09.558
by the immune system's macrophages.

00:03:10.203 --> 00:03:14.108
Ultraviolet radiation can also
contribute to this pigment breakdown,

00:03:14.132 --> 00:03:16.612
though it can be mitigated
by the use of sunblock.

00:03:17.041 --> 00:03:19.597
But since the dermal cells
are relatively stable,

00:03:19.621 --> 00:03:23.430
much of the ink will remain deep
in the skin for a person's whole life.

00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:28.870
But if tattoos are embedded in your skin
for life, is there any way to erase them?

00:03:28.894 --> 00:03:30.011
Technically, yes.

00:03:30.366 --> 00:03:33.809
Today, a laser is used
to penetrate the epidermis

00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:37.954
and blast apart underlying pigment
colors of various wavelengths,

00:03:37.978 --> 00:03:40.054
black being the easiest to target.

00:03:40.715 --> 00:03:44.109
The laser beam breaks the ink globules
into smaller particles

00:03:44.133 --> 00:03:46.943
that can then be cleared away
by the macrophages.

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:50.638
But some color inks are harder
to remove than others,

00:03:50.662 --> 00:03:52.494
and there could be complications.

00:03:52.518 --> 00:03:56.656
For this reason, removing a tattoo
is still more difficult than getting one,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.905
but not impossible.

00:03:58.175 --> 00:04:01.367
So a single tattoo may
not truly last forever,

00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:04.665
but tattoos have been around longer
than any existing culture.

00:04:04.975 --> 00:04:09.347
And their continuing popularity means
that the art of tattooing is here to stay.
