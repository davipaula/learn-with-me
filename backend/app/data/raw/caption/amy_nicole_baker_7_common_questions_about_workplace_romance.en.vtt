00:00:12.214 --> 00:00:14.223
Workplace romance can be a tricky topic.

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:15.398
(Music)

00:00:15.422 --> 00:00:16.984
[The Way We Work]

00:00:17.232 --> 00:00:19.009
How do we manage the boundaries

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.335
between our personal
and professional lives?

00:00:21.335 --> 00:00:25.114
How do we deal with gender imbalances
and power dynamics in the workplace?

00:00:25.114 --> 00:00:27.578
There's a lot of gray area
in workplace romance.

00:00:27.578 --> 00:00:28.978
I'd like to take a few minutes

00:00:28.978 --> 00:00:30.953
and answer some of your
frequently asked questions.

00:00:30.977 --> 00:00:34.173
So, question one:
Should I date my coworker?

00:00:34.197 --> 00:00:36.172
Uh ... it depends.

00:00:36.576 --> 00:00:38.704
Do you want to date
your coworker for a bit of fun?

00:00:38.728 --> 00:00:40.557
Do you want to date
your coworker to hook up?

00:00:40.557 --> 00:00:42.537
Because then you're really
better off on Tinder.

00:00:42.537 --> 00:00:44.206
If you want to date your coworker

00:00:44.206 --> 00:00:47.176
because you really, sincerely think
you're falling in love with them

00:00:47.176 --> 00:00:51.530
or there's a real potential
for a long-term, committed relationship,

00:00:51.614 --> 00:00:53.462
maybe you should date your coworker.

00:00:53.536 --> 00:00:56.243
Studies show that your coworkers
are generally positive about it

00:00:56.267 --> 00:00:58.478
if they perceive
that you're falling in love

00:00:58.502 --> 00:01:00.652
and genuinely care about each other.

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:04.095
It's when your coworkers sense
that something else is in play --

00:01:04.095 --> 00:01:05.513
that can be disruptive.

00:01:05.513 --> 00:01:06.701
Question two:

00:01:06.725 --> 00:01:08.310
Should I date my boss?

00:01:08.384 --> 00:01:11.372
In almost all cases, no,
you should not date your boss,

00:01:11.396 --> 00:01:14.009
because now, you've got a power dynamic.

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.581
When there's a relationship
between a boss and a subordinate,

00:01:16.605 --> 00:01:19.537
it generates a lot of negative feelings,

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:21.703
and the negative feelings
tend to fall on the person

00:01:21.703 --> 00:01:23.437
who's lower on the totem pole.

00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:25.070
People usually assume
some kind of favoritism,

00:01:25.094 --> 00:01:27.110
some kind of inside knowledge,

00:01:27.134 --> 00:01:29.349
and there can be resentment
stirred up by that.

00:01:29.373 --> 00:01:31.135
There was a study published last year

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.504
that suggested dating a superior can even
have a negative impact on your career.

00:01:36.504 --> 00:01:39.375
The researchers asked
third-party evaluators online

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.961
to imagine that they worked at a law firm.

00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:45.533
They asked them to make recommendations
on which employee should get picked

00:01:45.557 --> 00:01:47.074
for a special training program

00:01:47.098 --> 00:01:49.542
and which should get promoted to partner.

00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:52.368
They looked at credentials
for imaginary employees,

00:01:52.392 --> 00:01:55.393
and when it was stated
that an employee had been dating

00:01:55.417 --> 00:01:58.053
or was in a relationship with a superior,

00:01:58.077 --> 00:02:02.622
the evaluators were less likely to pick
that person for the training program

00:02:02.646 --> 00:02:03.891
or the promotion,

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:06.423
even if they had the exact
same credentials

00:02:06.447 --> 00:02:09.032
as someone who wasn't dating their boss.

00:02:09.056 --> 00:02:12.551
The evaluators were also quick
to dismiss their accomplishments.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:14.082
Question three:

00:02:14.106 --> 00:02:15.969
Can I date someone who reports to me?

00:02:16.367 --> 00:02:17.534
Still a big no.

00:02:17.558 --> 00:02:20.982
You may not feel like
you're really the boss, right?

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:23.591
But you are, and there's
a power dynamic there

00:02:23.615 --> 00:02:25.894
that's simply not there for other couples.

00:02:25.918 --> 00:02:32.054
If you really believe there is a sincere,
honestly felt, personal connection

00:02:32.078 --> 00:02:34.289
that would be lasting and meaningful,

00:02:34.313 --> 00:02:36.258
one of you may need to move,

00:02:36.282 --> 00:02:40.873
and it shouldn't always be the person
who's lower in the company pecking order.

00:02:41.265 --> 00:02:42.471
Question four:

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:44.693
I've just started seeing a coworker.

00:02:44.717 --> 00:02:46.162
How do we handle things?

00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:47.440
I get this question a lot.

00:02:47.464 --> 00:02:49.592
"Are they dating? Are they not dating?"

00:02:49.616 --> 00:02:50.862
Don't keep it a secret.

00:02:50.886 --> 00:02:54.483
You don't have to make a big deal of it,
but secrecy tends to be corrosive.

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:58.494
People tend to see workplace couples
as a coalition or a unit,

00:02:58.518 --> 00:03:02.284
so try to make it clear to your coworkers
that you're not the same person;

00:03:02.308 --> 00:03:05.178
you love each other,
but you are going to disagree.

00:03:05.423 --> 00:03:06.573
Question five:

00:03:06.597 --> 00:03:09.717
Why are coworkers
often attracted to each other?

00:03:09.741 --> 00:03:13.252
Well, the obvious answer is people
tend to be attracted to each other

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:15.093
the more time they spend together.

00:03:15.117 --> 00:03:17.601
But there's another ingredient
that has to be added:

00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:19.419
attraction tends to happen

00:03:19.443 --> 00:03:22.520
when there's work that demands
close collaboration.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.232
So imagine you have a big group project
with a tight deadline

00:03:26.256 --> 00:03:29.832
and you're working late nights
and brainstorming ideas.

00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:31.543
You look up, and across the table,

00:03:31.567 --> 00:03:34.444
one of your colleagues throws out
a really great idea.

00:03:34.468 --> 00:03:37.369
You may feel something,
and that's natural.

00:03:37.393 --> 00:03:39.487
We call this task interdependence.

00:03:39.487 --> 00:03:41.685
It's a ripe ground for attraction.

00:03:41.685 --> 00:03:45.192
The second reason why people at work
are attracted to each other

00:03:45.216 --> 00:03:48.172
is they may often be
similar to each other.

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:49.944
There's two old adages:

00:03:49.948 --> 00:03:53.042
"Birds of a feather flock together."
And "Opposites attract."

00:03:53.082 --> 00:03:56.673
Well, the psychological
research suggests ...

00:03:56.673 --> 00:03:58.845
birds of a feather flock together,

00:03:58.845 --> 00:04:00.744
and we like people who are like us.

00:04:00.744 --> 00:04:01.889
Question six:

00:04:01.913 --> 00:04:03.761
My coworkers are flirting.

00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:05.604
I'm annoyed. What do I do?

00:04:05.628 --> 00:04:09.152
Some researchers argue
that for people flirting at work,

00:04:09.176 --> 00:04:11.556
flirting is good and it boosts creativity.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.514
But my own research suggests
things are different

00:04:14.538 --> 00:04:18.793
for people who are watching
or who are subjected to the flirting.

00:04:18.817 --> 00:04:20.246
It can be awkward, right?

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.397
Witnessing flirtation in the workplace
creates a sense of not knowing the rules,

00:04:24.421 --> 00:04:26.207
not knowing what's going on,

00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:29.255
or maybe seeing something
that you shouldn't be seeing.

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:31.899
People who frequently witness
flirting at work --

00:04:31.923 --> 00:04:34.953
they actually report feeling
less satisfied in their jobs,

00:04:34.977 --> 00:04:37.194
and they feel less valued
by their company.

00:04:37.218 --> 00:04:40.883
They're more likely to give a negative
appraisal of the work environment,

00:04:40.907 --> 00:04:42.631
and they may even consider leaving.

00:04:42.655 --> 00:04:45.531
For women, this association
can be even stronger.

00:04:45.555 --> 00:04:46.912
This appears to be the case

00:04:46.936 --> 00:04:50.371
even when people report
not being bothered by the flirting.

00:04:50.395 --> 00:04:52.617
It's true even when they say
they enjoy it.

00:04:52.641 --> 00:04:56.402
So, a flirtatious environment
really could be toxic.

00:04:56.426 --> 00:04:57.448
Question seven:

00:04:57.448 --> 00:05:00.284
Do I need a policy
on workplace relationships?

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:02.918
You certainly need a policy
on a sexual harassment,

00:05:02.922 --> 00:05:05.665
and I think most HR departments
recognize that.

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:08.761
But for the kind of consensual
behavior we've been talking about,

00:05:08.761 --> 00:05:09.932
it's a little different.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.557
As much as people in HR
would love to wave a magic wand

00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:16.332
and say, "Thou shall not
fall in love at work,"

00:05:16.356 --> 00:05:17.936
it's just not realistic.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.128
Emotional connection
and sexuality is who we are.

00:05:21.152 --> 00:05:23.671
I kind of want you
to flip the script a little bit.

00:05:23.695 --> 00:05:27.387
I encourage HR
to really think more broadly

00:05:27.411 --> 00:05:31.281
about their role in not necessarily
stamping out office romance,

00:05:31.305 --> 00:05:33.258
because I don't think that's realistic,

00:05:33.282 --> 00:05:37.481
but how do I help create
a workplace climate and culture

00:05:37.505 --> 00:05:41.799
where people feel respected
for their individual contributions,

00:05:41.823 --> 00:05:44.724
not for their appearance or their gender,

00:05:44.748 --> 00:05:46.741
or their personal relationships?

00:05:46.765 --> 00:05:48.244
So the larger question is,

00:05:48.268 --> 00:05:52.563
how do you make sure
people are valued and respected?
