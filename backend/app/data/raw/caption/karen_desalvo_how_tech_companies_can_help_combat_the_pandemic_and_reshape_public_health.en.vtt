Whitney Pennington Rodgers:
Before we really dive in

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.548
to talking specifically
about Google's work

00:00:16.572 --> 00:00:18.013
in the contact tracing space,

00:00:18.037 --> 00:00:21.866
let's first set up the relationship
between public health and tech.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.540
You know, I think a lot of people,

00:00:23.564 --> 00:00:26.425
they hear "Google," and they think of
this big tech company.

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:27.889
They think of a search engine.

00:00:27.913 --> 00:00:29.478
And there may be questions about

00:00:29.502 --> 00:00:32.478
why does Google
have a chief health officer?

00:00:32.502 --> 00:00:34.697
So could you talk a little bit
about your work

00:00:34.721 --> 00:00:36.388
and the work your team does?

00:00:36.412 --> 00:00:38.827
Karen DeSalvo: Yeah. Well,
maybe I'm the embodiment

00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:40.921
of public health and tech coming together.

00:00:40.945 --> 00:00:45.480
My background is, I practiced
medicine for 20 years,

00:00:45.504 --> 00:00:48.739
though a part of my work
has always been in public health.

00:00:48.763 --> 00:00:51.501
In fact, my first job,
putting myself through college,

00:00:51.525 --> 00:00:54.590
was working at the state laboratory
in Massachusetts.

00:00:54.614 --> 00:00:58.732
As the story will go with Joia [Mukherjee]
we're reconnected again,

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:00.287
a Massachusetts theme.

00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:05.210
And I, across the journey
of the work that I was doing

00:01:05.234 --> 00:01:06.528
for my patients

00:01:06.552 --> 00:01:08.264
to provide them information

00:01:08.288 --> 00:01:12.191
and the right care and meet them
where they were medically,

00:01:12.215 --> 00:01:13.450
translated into the work

00:01:13.474 --> 00:01:16.298
that I did when I was
the Health Commissioner in New Orleans

00:01:16.322 --> 00:01:19.606
and later when I had other roles
in public health practice,

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.464
that really is about thinking
of people and community

00:01:23.488 --> 00:01:27.223
in the context in which they live
and how we provide the best information,

00:01:27.247 --> 00:01:28.412
the best resources,

00:01:28.436 --> 00:01:31.727
the best services that are
culturally and linguistically appropriate,

00:01:31.751 --> 00:01:32.990
meet them where they are.

00:01:33.014 --> 00:01:35.869
And when the opportunity arose
to join the team at Google,

00:01:35.893 --> 00:01:37.282
I was really thrilled,

00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:40.830
because one of the things
that I have learned across my journey

00:01:40.854 --> 00:01:43.877
is that having the right
information at the right time

00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:45.816
can make all the difference
in the world.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.265
It can literally save lives.

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.580
And billions of people
come to Google every day

00:01:49.604 --> 00:01:51.074
asking for information,

00:01:51.098 --> 00:01:56.092
and so it is a tremendous opportunity
to have that right information

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.890
and those resources to people

00:01:57.914 --> 00:01:59.981
so that they can make good choices,

00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:02.110
so that they can have
the right information,

00:02:02.134 --> 00:02:04.481
so that they can participate
in their own health,

00:02:04.505 --> 00:02:06.944
but also, in the context
of this historic pandemic,

00:02:06.968 --> 00:02:09.272
be a part of the broader health
of the community,

00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:12.957
whether it's to flatten the curve
or keep the curve flat as we go forward.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.618
WPR: And so it sounds like
that there is this connection, then,

00:02:17.642 --> 00:02:20.482
between public health
and what Google's work is

00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:24.701
in thinking about public education
and providing information.

00:02:24.725 --> 00:02:27.326
And so could you talk
a little bit about that link

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.967
between public health
and public education and Google?

00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:32.183
KD: Definitely.

00:02:32.207 --> 00:02:34.885
You know, the essential
public health services

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.680
include communication and data,

00:02:37.704 --> 00:02:41.923
and these are two areas where
tech in general, but certainly Google,

00:02:41.947 --> 00:02:45.563
has an opportunity to partner
with the public health system

00:02:45.587 --> 00:02:48.633
and with the public
for their health more broadly.

00:02:48.657 --> 00:02:53.808
You know, going back
to the earlier days of this pandemic,

00:02:53.832 --> 00:02:56.088
towards the end of January,

00:02:56.112 --> 00:03:01.945
Google first leaned in to start
to put information out to the public

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.991
about how to find resources
in their local community,

00:03:06.015 --> 00:03:09.916
from the CDC or from other
authoritative resources.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.413
So on the search page,
we put up "knowledge panels,"

00:03:12.437 --> 00:03:13.951
is the way that we describe it,

00:03:13.975 --> 00:03:16.175
and we did develop an SOS alert,

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:19.278
which is something
we've done for other crises,

00:03:19.302 --> 00:03:21.679
and in this particular historic crisis,

00:03:21.703 --> 00:03:25.418
we wanted to be certain
that when people went on to search,

00:03:25.442 --> 00:03:28.222
that there was authoritative information,

00:03:28.246 --> 00:03:31.362
which is always there but certainly
very prominently displayed,

00:03:31.386 --> 00:03:34.512
and do that in partnership
with public health authorities.

00:03:34.536 --> 00:03:39.372
So we began our journey
really very much in an information way

00:03:39.396 --> 00:03:42.632
of making certain that people
knew how to get the right information

00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:44.317
at the right time to save lives.

00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:48.404
I think the journey for us
over the course of the last few months

00:03:48.428 --> 00:03:53.521
has been to continue to lean in
on how we provide information

00:03:53.545 --> 00:03:58.444
in partnership with
public health authorities in local areas,

00:03:58.468 --> 00:04:01.823
directing people in a certain state
to their state's health department,

00:04:01.847 --> 00:04:04.821
helping people get
information about testing.

00:04:04.845 --> 00:04:07.054
There's also been, though,

00:04:07.078 --> 00:04:11.052
a suite of resources that we wanted
to provide to the health care community,

00:04:11.076 --> 00:04:15.610
whether that was for health care providers
that may not have access to PPE,

00:04:15.634 --> 00:04:16.888
for example,

00:04:16.912 --> 00:04:19.263
we did a partnership
with the CDC Foundation.

00:04:19.287 --> 00:04:21.190
Though the scale of the company

00:04:21.214 --> 00:04:24.074
and the opportunity for us
to partner with public health

00:04:24.098 --> 00:04:29.730
around things like helping public health
understand if their blunt policies

00:04:29.754 --> 00:04:32.187
around social distancing
to flatten the curve

00:04:32.211 --> 00:04:35.110
were actually having an impact
on behavior in the community.

00:04:35.134 --> 00:04:36.953
That's our community mobility reports.

00:04:36.977 --> 00:04:41.491
We were asked by public health agencies
all across the world,

00:04:41.515 --> 00:04:44.346
including some of
my colleagues here in the US,

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.525
could we help them have a better
evidence-based way to understand

00:04:47.549 --> 00:04:50.828
the policies around social distancing
or shelter in place?

00:04:50.852 --> 00:04:53.777
Which I think we'll talk about more later.

00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:58.206
In addition to that sort of work,
also been working to support public health

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.049
in this really essential work
they're doing for contact tracing,

00:05:02.073 --> 00:05:04.668
which is very human-resource intensive,

00:05:04.692 --> 00:05:06.455
very complex,

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.808
incredibly important
to keep the curve flat

00:05:08.832 --> 00:05:10.680
and prevent future outbreaks,

00:05:10.704 --> 00:05:15.821
and give time and space for health care
and, importantly, science

00:05:15.845 --> 00:05:19.007
to do the work they need to do
to create treatments

00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:21.441
and, very importantly, a vaccine.

00:05:21.465 --> 00:05:26.906
So that work around providing
an additional set of digital tools,

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.722
exposure notification
for the contact tracing community,

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:33.218
is one of the other areas where we've
been supporting the public health.

00:05:33.242 --> 00:05:35.631
So we think, as we've thought
about this pandemic,

00:05:35.655 --> 00:05:38.542
it's support the users,
which is the consumer.

00:05:38.566 --> 00:05:41.463
There's also a health care system
and a scientific community

00:05:41.487 --> 00:05:43.015
where we've been partnering.

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:44.741
And then, of course, public health.

00:05:44.765 --> 00:05:50.391
And for me, I mean, Whitney,
this is just a wonderful opportunity

00:05:50.415 --> 00:05:54.499
for Big Tech to come together
with the public health infrastructure.

00:05:54.523 --> 00:05:57.344
Public health, as Joia was
sort of articulating before,

00:05:57.368 --> 00:05:59.599
is often an unsung hero.

00:05:59.623 --> 00:06:02.145
It saves your life every day,
but you didn't know it.

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:07.350
And it is also a pretty under-resourced
part of our health infrastructure,

00:06:07.374 --> 00:06:09.372
globally, but especially in the US.

00:06:09.396 --> 00:06:12.214
It's something I worked on a lot
before I came to Google.

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:14.414
And so the opportunity to partner

00:06:14.438 --> 00:06:17.518
and do everything
that we can as a company

00:06:17.542 --> 00:06:20.678
and, in this case, with contact tracing
in partnership with Apple

00:06:20.702 --> 00:06:23.825
to create a very privacy-promoting,
useful, helpful product

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:26.479
that is going to be a part
of the bigger contact tracing

00:06:26.503 --> 00:06:28.503
is something that we feel really proud of

00:06:28.527 --> 00:06:31.292
and look forward to continuing
to work with public health.

00:06:31.316 --> 00:06:35.061
In fact, we were on the phone this morning
with a suite of public health groups

00:06:35.085 --> 00:06:36.236
from across the country,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.450
listening again to what would be helpful
questions that they have.

00:06:39.474 --> 00:06:41.636
And as we think about
rolling out the system,

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.864
this is the way that we've been
for the last many months at Google,

00:06:44.888 --> 00:06:48.483
and I'm just really ...

00:06:48.507 --> 00:06:53.079
I landed at a place just a few months
ago -- I just started at Google --

00:06:53.103 --> 00:06:56.523
where we can have an impact
on what people know

00:06:56.547 --> 00:06:57.728
all across the world.

00:06:57.752 --> 00:07:00.856
And I'll tell you, as a public
health professional and as a doc,

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.830
that is one of the most critical things.

00:07:02.854 --> 00:07:04.824
People need to have the right information

00:07:04.848 --> 00:07:07.064
so they can help navigate
their health journey,

00:07:07.088 --> 00:07:10.898
but also especially in this pandemic
because it's going to save lives.

00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:13.642
WPR: That's great. Thank you.

00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:17.677
So, to talk more about
this contact tracing system

00:07:17.701 --> 00:07:19.935
and the exposure notification app,

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:22.145
we've read so much about this.

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:25.096
Could you describe this,
a little bit about how the app works,

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.609
what exactly are users seeing,

00:07:27.633 --> 00:07:30.183
what information is being collected?

00:07:30.207 --> 00:07:33.753
Just give us sort of a broad sense
of what this app does.

00:07:34.276 --> 00:07:35.429
KD: Yeah.

00:07:35.453 --> 00:07:37.996
Let me just start
by explaining what it is,

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.683
and it's actually not even an app,

00:07:40.707 --> 00:07:42.318
it's just an API.

00:07:42.342 --> 00:07:49.259
It's a system that allows
a public health agency

00:07:49.283 --> 00:07:51.726
to create an app,

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:56.021
and only the API,
this doorway to the phone system,

00:07:56.045 --> 00:07:57.604
is available to public health.

00:07:57.628 --> 00:07:59.935
So it's not designed for any other purpose

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:02.842
than to support public health
and the work that they're doing

00:08:02.866 --> 00:08:06.342
in COVID-19 in contact tracing.

00:08:06.366 --> 00:08:09.552
The second piece of this
is that we wanted to build a system

00:08:09.576 --> 00:08:11.160
that was privacy-promoting,

00:08:11.184 --> 00:08:12.995
that really put the user first,

00:08:13.019 --> 00:08:16.763
gave them the opportunity
to opt into the system

00:08:16.787 --> 00:08:19.358
and opt out whenever
they wanted to do that,

00:08:19.382 --> 00:08:23.366
so they also have some control
over how they're engaging

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:25.625
and using their phone, basically,

00:08:25.649 --> 00:08:29.966
as a part of keeping the curve
flat around the world.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:33.995
The system was developed in response
to requests that we were getting

00:08:34.019 --> 00:08:38.678
about how could technology,
particularly smartphones,

00:08:38.702 --> 00:08:42.480
be useful in contact tracing?

00:08:42.504 --> 00:08:47.058
And as we thought this through
and talked with public health experts

00:08:47.082 --> 00:08:48.882
and academics and privacy experts,

00:08:48.906 --> 00:08:52.853
it was pretty clear that obviously
contract tracing is a complex endeavor

00:08:52.877 --> 00:08:55.218
that does require human resources,

00:08:55.242 --> 00:08:59.292
because there's a lot
of very particular things

00:08:59.316 --> 00:09:02.018
that you need to do
in having conversations with people

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.895
as part of contact tracing.

00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:05.157
On the other hand,

00:09:05.181 --> 00:09:11.161
there's some opportunity
to better inform the contact investigators

00:09:11.185 --> 00:09:14.881
with things like, particularly,
an exposure log.

00:09:14.905 --> 00:09:18.278
So one of the things that happens
when the contact tracer calls you

00:09:18.302 --> 00:09:20.216
or visits you is they ask,

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.253
"Hey, in the last certain number of days,"

00:09:22.277 --> 00:09:26.102
and in the case of COVID, it would be
a couple days before symptoms developed,

00:09:26.126 --> 00:09:29.336
"Hey, tell us the story of what
you've been involved in doing

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.504
so that we can begin to think through
where you might have been,

00:09:32.528 --> 00:09:35.658
to the grocery or to church
or what other activities

00:09:35.682 --> 00:09:38.203
and with whom you might
have been into contact."

00:09:38.227 --> 00:09:40.852
There's some amount of recall bias
in that for all us,

00:09:40.876 --> 00:09:43.258
like we forget where we might have been,

00:09:43.282 --> 00:09:46.479
and there's also an amount
of anonymous contact.

00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:48.953
So there are times when
we're out in the world,

00:09:48.977 --> 00:09:51.291
on a bus or in a store,

00:09:51.315 --> 00:09:55.590
and we may have come into prolonged
and close contact with someone

00:09:55.614 --> 00:09:57.162
and wouldn't know who they were.

00:09:57.186 --> 00:09:58.678
And so the augmentation

00:09:58.702 --> 00:10:01.965
that the exposure
notification system provides

00:10:01.989 --> 00:10:04.013
is designed to fill in those gaps

00:10:04.037 --> 00:10:07.121
and to expedite the notification
to public health

00:10:07.145 --> 00:10:08.637
of who has a positive test,

00:10:08.661 --> 00:10:10.577
because the person would have notified,

00:10:10.601 --> 00:10:13.050
they trigger something
that notifies public health,

00:10:13.074 --> 00:10:17.963
and then to fill in some of those gaps
in the prior exposure.

00:10:17.987 --> 00:10:23.596
What it does not do is it does not use
GPS or location to track people.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.306
So the system actually uses
something different

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.077
called Bluetooth Low Energy,

00:10:28.101 --> 00:10:30.302
which is privacy-preserving,

00:10:30.326 --> 00:10:32.295
it doesn't drain the battery

00:10:32.319 --> 00:10:35.288
and it makes it more also interoperable

00:10:35.312 --> 00:10:37.551
between both Apple and the Android system

00:10:37.575 --> 00:10:39.828
so it's more useful,
not only in the US context,

00:10:39.852 --> 00:10:41.399
but globally.

00:10:41.423 --> 00:10:44.068
So we built this system
in response to some requests

00:10:44.092 --> 00:10:46.542
to help augment
the contact-tracing systems.

00:10:46.566 --> 00:10:49.160
We wanted to do it in a way
that was user-controlled

00:10:49.184 --> 00:10:50.629
and privacy-preserving

00:10:50.653 --> 00:10:53.486
and had technological features

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:58.626
that would allow public health
to augment the exposure log

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:02.337
in a way that would accelerate
the work that they needed to get done

00:11:02.361 --> 00:11:05.583
to interrupt transmission --
keep the R naught less than one --

00:11:05.607 --> 00:11:10.757
and do that in a way that we would also
be able to partner with public health

00:11:10.781 --> 00:11:12.124
to think about risk scoring.

00:11:12.148 --> 00:11:14.983
We could talk more about
any of these areas that you want,

00:11:15.007 --> 00:11:17.282
but I think maybe

00:11:17.306 --> 00:11:20.221
one of the most important things
that I want to say, Whitney,

00:11:20.245 --> 00:11:23.559
is how grateful Apple and Google are --

00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:26.651
I'll take a moment to speak
for my colleagues at Apple --

00:11:26.675 --> 00:11:30.202
to the great partnership
from public health across the world

00:11:30.226 --> 00:11:32.491
and to academics and to others

00:11:32.515 --> 00:11:35.402
who have helped us think through
how this can be,

00:11:35.426 --> 00:11:37.253
how the exposure notification system

00:11:37.277 --> 00:11:39.588
fits into the broader
contact tracing portfolio,

00:11:39.612 --> 00:11:43.271
and how it does it in a way
that really respects and protects privacy

00:11:43.295 --> 00:11:45.288
and also is useful to public health.

00:11:45.312 --> 00:11:47.705
We're still on this journey with them,

00:11:47.729 --> 00:11:50.483
and I really believe that
we're going to be able to help,

00:11:50.507 --> 00:11:53.398
and I'm looking forward
to being a part of the great work

00:11:53.422 --> 00:11:56.278
that public health's got to do
on the front lines every day,

00:11:56.302 --> 00:11:57.468
been doing, frankly,

00:11:57.492 --> 00:11:59.163
but needs to be able to step up.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.364
WPR: That's great, and thank you
for that really detailed explanation.

00:12:03.388 --> 00:12:07.269
And you know, we actually have Chris here
with some questions from our community,

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:09.373
so why don't we turn there really quickly.

00:12:09.856 --> 00:12:12.654
Chris Anderson: Yep.
Questions pouring in, Karen.

00:12:12.678 --> 00:12:16.010
Here's one from Vishal Gurbuxani.

00:12:16.034 --> 00:12:17.205
Uh ... Gurbu --

00:12:17.229 --> 00:12:20.306
I've pronounced that horribly wrong,
but make up your own mind.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.408
Vishal, we'll connect later
and you can tell me how to say that.

00:12:23.432 --> 00:12:27.139
KD: Fabulous last name. I love that.
That's a Scrabble word.

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:28.859
CA: "Given where we are today,

00:12:28.883 --> 00:12:31.277
how should employees think about
returning to work,

00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:33.512
with so many conflicting messages?"

00:12:35.633 --> 00:12:39.761
KD: This has been an important part
of my work for the last few months.

00:12:39.785 --> 00:12:43.239
I joined Google in December,
and all this started happening.

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:47.576
The pandemic in the world
first began in November

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:51.706
but it got very hot
in many parts of the world

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:52.893
in the last few months,

00:12:52.917 --> 00:12:55.961
and we've been thinking a lot
about how to protect Googlers

00:12:55.985 --> 00:12:57.547
but also protect the community.

00:12:57.571 --> 00:13:00.277
I've been talking a lot about
what we've done externally.

00:13:00.301 --> 00:13:02.628
You know, internally,
Google made a decision

00:13:02.652 --> 00:13:04.715
to go to work-from-home pretty early.

00:13:04.739 --> 00:13:06.367
We believed that we could.

00:13:06.391 --> 00:13:10.664
We believed that in all the places
across the world where we have offices,

00:13:10.688 --> 00:13:13.552
that the more we could not only model

00:13:13.576 --> 00:13:16.866
but frankly just be
a part of flattening the curve,

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.191
that we would be good citizens.

00:13:20.215 --> 00:13:23.537
So we have been fairly ...

00:13:23.561 --> 00:13:26.903
I don't know if the right word
is conservative or assertive, about it,

00:13:26.927 --> 00:13:30.676
because we really wanted to make sure
that we were doing everything we could

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:35.023
just to get people to shelter in place
and socially distance.

00:13:35.047 --> 00:13:37.616
A lot of other companies
have been doing the same,

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.344
and I think the choices
that people are making

00:13:40.368 --> 00:13:44.140
are going to be predicated
on a whole array of factors:

00:13:44.164 --> 00:13:46.068
the rates of local transmission;

00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:48.083
governmental expectations;

00:13:48.107 --> 00:13:51.839
the ability to work from home;

00:13:51.863 --> 00:13:54.552
the individual characteristics
of the workers themselves,

00:13:54.576 --> 00:13:57.425
how much risk they might have
or how much risk it would be

00:13:57.449 --> 00:13:59.772
for them to bring that back
into their household

00:13:59.796 --> 00:14:01.956
if they have people
living in their household

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.726
who would be at increased risk
from morbidity, mortality,

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:06.598
from suffering and death, from COVID.

00:14:06.622 --> 00:14:10.236
So these are individual
and local considerations.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:16.734
I think for us as a company, we want
to, as we've talked about publicly,

00:14:16.758 --> 00:14:21.218
we want to continue to be a part
of the public health solution

00:14:21.242 --> 00:14:22.672
around social distancing,

00:14:22.696 --> 00:14:26.126
and so that for us means
continuing to encourage work-from-home

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:27.523
for our employees

00:14:27.547 --> 00:14:31.649
and really only be in if it's essential
that people are in the workplace.

00:14:31.673 --> 00:14:35.724
And we've said publicly that we're going
to be doing that for many months to come.

00:14:35.748 --> 00:14:37.641
Now, here's one thing I do want to say,

00:14:37.665 --> 00:14:39.563
which is,

00:14:40.357 --> 00:14:44.607
working from home
has definite benefits,

00:14:44.631 --> 00:14:47.778
not only for the pandemic,

00:14:47.802 --> 00:14:54.556
but for some people,
time for commute, etc.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.961
I think we're already learning
there are some downsides,

00:14:57.985 --> 00:14:59.876
and there are generic downsides,

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.488
even just not from work-from-home
but school-from-home

00:15:02.512 --> 00:15:03.697
and just being at home,

00:15:03.721 --> 00:15:05.484
which is: social isolation is real.

00:15:05.508 --> 00:15:06.733
It causes depression.

00:15:06.757 --> 00:15:09.115
It has physical impacts
on people's bodies;

00:15:09.139 --> 00:15:10.635
there's science around this.

00:15:10.659 --> 00:15:14.058
So as the world is weighing,

00:15:14.082 --> 00:15:15.459
even beyond the pandemic,

00:15:15.483 --> 00:15:19.306
when we've achieved herd immunity

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.542
because we've been able
to vaccinate the world

00:15:21.566 --> 00:15:24.763
with a functioning vaccine
that creates immunity,

00:15:24.787 --> 00:15:26.982
I think probably a lot of workplaces

00:15:27.006 --> 00:15:29.177
are going to want
to encourage work-from-home.

00:15:29.201 --> 00:15:33.052
But I just want us also to remember
that part of humanity is community,

00:15:33.076 --> 00:15:37.783
and so we'll have to be thinking through
how we balance those activities.

00:15:37.807 --> 00:15:40.670
CA: And, of course, there are
huge swathes of the economy

00:15:40.694 --> 00:15:43.181
that can't work from home.

00:15:43.205 --> 00:15:45.901
We're a lucky few who can.

00:15:45.925 --> 00:15:49.158
And speaking of which,
here's a question from Otho Kerr.

00:15:49.182 --> 00:15:51.364
"Vulnerable communities
seem to be receiving

00:15:51.388 --> 00:15:53.679
a disproportionate amount
of misinformation.

00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:54.955
What is Google doing

00:15:54.979 --> 00:15:57.991
to help make sure these communities
are receiving accurate news

00:15:58.015 --> 00:15:59.710
rather than fake news?"

00:15:59.734 --> 00:16:02.515
KD: You know, vulnerable communities
is where I have spent

00:16:02.539 --> 00:16:04.385
most of my career focused.

00:16:04.409 --> 00:16:08.100
I think with many things
that we've learned as a society

00:16:08.124 --> 00:16:09.517
in this pandemic

00:16:09.541 --> 00:16:12.039
were things that we,
frankly, should have known.

00:16:12.063 --> 00:16:15.950
And before I get to the information,
I'll just talk about access to services,

00:16:15.974 --> 00:16:21.407
which is to say, and to brag, I guess,
on my hometown of New Orleans.

00:16:21.431 --> 00:16:24.807
One of the early things
that New Orleans learned,

00:16:24.831 --> 00:16:26.816
or remembered or whatever,

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.004
was that drive-through testing
only works if you have a car.

00:16:30.028 --> 00:16:33.764
So you need walk-up testing,
and it needs to be in the neighborhood.

00:16:33.788 --> 00:16:35.842
We need to meet people where they are,

00:16:35.866 --> 00:16:40.716
and it's thematic of all the work that we
did after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.847
was to build back a health care
and public health infrastructure

00:16:43.871 --> 00:16:47.602
that was community-oriented,
built with community not for community.

00:16:47.626 --> 00:16:53.179
Of all the many things that I really
do hope last from this pandemic,

00:16:53.203 --> 00:16:56.321
one of them, though, is that
we're being much more conscious

00:16:56.345 --> 00:17:00.244
of building with especially
vulnerable communities

00:17:00.268 --> 00:17:03.494
and building out policies and processes

00:17:03.518 --> 00:17:07.125
that are as inclusive as possible.

00:17:07.149 --> 00:17:12.477
For Google information,
we start with,

00:17:12.501 --> 00:17:15.223
on the search platform, for example,

00:17:15.247 --> 00:17:16.655
adding up knowledge panels,

00:17:16.679 --> 00:17:21.390
that we spend time making sure are
linguistically and culturally appropriate.

00:17:21.414 --> 00:17:24.029
We tend to start globally,

00:17:24.053 --> 00:17:27.349
with global authoritative groups
like the World Health Organization

00:17:27.373 --> 00:17:29.385
or the National Health Service or CDC,

00:17:29.409 --> 00:17:34.863
and then we begin to build down
to more focused jurisdictions.

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:37.883
On other platforms
that we have like YouTube,

00:17:37.907 --> 00:17:39.978
we've built out special channels

00:17:40.002 --> 00:17:43.993
where we do, because
it's a platform and we can host content,

00:17:44.017 --> 00:17:46.342
we've partnered with creatives --

00:17:46.366 --> 00:17:48.915
we call them, I don't know,
that's a new thing for me

00:17:48.939 --> 00:17:50.129
because I'm a doctor --

00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:53.438
but we've partnered
with creatives and influencers

00:17:53.462 --> 00:17:55.809
whose reach resonates with communities.

00:17:55.833 --> 00:17:58.758
We have had particular programming,
for example, for seniors,

00:17:58.782 --> 00:18:00.055
African-Americans,

00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:02.415
so "vulnerable" takes on
a lot of meaning for us

00:18:02.439 --> 00:18:03.943
globally and in the US context.

00:18:03.967 --> 00:18:05.612
Our work is not done,

00:18:05.636 --> 00:18:10.072
and we certainly every day are thinking
about how we can do more

00:18:10.096 --> 00:18:13.410
to see that the information is accessible,

00:18:13.434 --> 00:18:14.608
accurate

00:18:14.632 --> 00:18:18.326
and also, frankly, interesting
so that people want to engage.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:19.868
CA: Yeah.

00:18:19.892 --> 00:18:21.254
Alright, thank you Karen.

00:18:21.278 --> 00:18:23.752
I'll be back in a bit
with some other questions.

00:18:24.751 --> 00:18:26.201
WPR: Thank you, Chris.

00:18:28.161 --> 00:18:31.154
And you know, and this is really
wonderful talking about

00:18:31.178 --> 00:18:34.884
more broadly, where you see
tech and public health going,

00:18:34.908 --> 00:18:37.831
and specifically, talking about
these vulnerable communities.

00:18:37.855 --> 00:18:41.470
And I think one thing,
even just beyond Google,

00:18:41.494 --> 00:18:44.070
it would be interesting
to sort of hear your thoughts

00:18:44.094 --> 00:18:47.774
on where you see tech in general
better serving public health,

00:18:47.798 --> 00:18:49.669
if there are spaces that you think,

00:18:49.693 --> 00:18:52.853
no matter which tech company
we're talking about,

00:18:52.877 --> 00:18:56.005
we could all sort of come together
to better serve the community.

00:18:56.029 --> 00:18:58.031
Do you have any thoughts on that?

00:18:59.349 --> 00:19:02.665
KD: I could spend several hours
talking to you about that,

00:19:02.689 --> 00:19:06.630
but maybe I'll just start by saying

00:19:06.654 --> 00:19:13.005
that I came to tech

00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:16.521
through the pathway
of direct patient care

00:19:16.545 --> 00:19:19.585
and public health service
in local community,

00:19:19.609 --> 00:19:23.938
and I ended up in a role
in the federal government

00:19:23.962 --> 00:19:26.086
as the National Coordinator for Health IT,

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:29.366
which, for my background,
felt unusual to me,

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:30.741
I'm just being honest.

00:19:30.765 --> 00:19:33.142
And I thought, well,
I'm not really a tech person,

00:19:33.166 --> 00:19:34.880
but the secretary at the time said,

00:19:34.904 --> 00:19:38.061
"That's exactly why we need you,
because we need to apply tech."

00:19:38.085 --> 00:19:42.012
And she had had the unfortunate experience
of hearing me chirp about

00:19:42.036 --> 00:19:47.383
how public health needed more timely data
to make better evidence-based policy

00:19:47.407 --> 00:19:49.520
on behalf of community and with community.

00:19:49.544 --> 00:19:53.033
This was a source of frustration for me
as a local public health officer,

00:19:53.057 --> 00:19:55.815
that sometimes the data
I was working on, though great,

00:19:55.839 --> 00:19:58.571
was stale by the time
I needed to make decisions

00:19:58.595 --> 00:20:02.362
about chronic disease interventions,
or mental health or even violence

00:20:02.386 --> 00:20:04.133
or intimate partner violence issues

00:20:04.157 --> 00:20:05.729
in my community.

00:20:05.753 --> 00:20:09.812
And so the desire to make data
useful and accessible

00:20:09.836 --> 00:20:12.326
to support people in communities

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:15.090
is something that's been
burning in me for a long time,

00:20:15.114 --> 00:20:19.319
and what I have learned
since I have been out in Silicon Valley

00:20:19.343 --> 00:20:24.313
is that that desire burns
in the bellies of many people

00:20:24.337 --> 00:20:27.581
who work at Google and Apple
and other companies,

00:20:27.605 --> 00:20:32.317
and it's been really wonderful to see,

00:20:32.341 --> 00:20:35.403
during this horrible time of the pandemic,

00:20:35.427 --> 00:20:39.982
the incredibly brilliant
engineering and programming

00:20:40.006 --> 00:20:42.409
and other minds at a company like Google

00:20:42.433 --> 00:20:45.935
turn their attention on
how can we partner with consumers

00:20:45.959 --> 00:20:48.212
and with public health
to do the right thing,

00:20:48.236 --> 00:20:50.472
to bring the resources
that we have to bear.

00:20:50.496 --> 00:20:54.956
And I said I could talk all day about it
because I have many examples

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.087
from the work that we have done at Google.

00:20:57.111 --> 00:20:59.795
Maybe I'll just point out a couple.

00:20:59.819 --> 00:21:03.087
One is to say that

00:21:03.111 --> 00:21:09.120
we very early on wanted to find
a crisp way to help people understand

00:21:09.144 --> 00:21:12.402
what they could do to protect
themselves and their community,

00:21:12.426 --> 00:21:14.997
to flatten the curve,
get the R naught less than one,

00:21:15.021 --> 00:21:18.754
and this "Do the Five" work
that our teams, largely in marketing

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:21.245
but then a lot of other people weighed in.

00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:23.653
It required massive amounts of talent

00:21:23.677 --> 00:21:27.960
to make that available
on our landing page, on search,

00:21:27.984 --> 00:21:31.175
and then fold it out more broadly.

00:21:31.199 --> 00:21:34.325
We did that in partnership
with the World Health Organization,

00:21:34.349 --> 00:21:36.974
then the CDC, then with countries
all across the world

00:21:36.998 --> 00:21:39.609
to get simple messaging
about staying home if you can

00:21:39.633 --> 00:21:42.021
and coughing into your elbow,
washing your hands.

00:21:42.045 --> 00:21:43.899
These are basic public health messages

00:21:43.923 --> 00:21:48.088
that public health has been,
frankly, even in flu season

00:21:48.112 --> 00:21:49.489
trying to get the word out,

00:21:49.513 --> 00:21:51.717
but it became,

00:21:51.741 --> 00:21:54.012
the resources at a company like a Google,

00:21:54.036 --> 00:21:55.781
and the reach to billions,

00:21:55.805 --> 00:21:58.408
it's a platform and a set of talents

00:21:58.432 --> 00:22:02.501
that aren't even the technical,
computer vision kind of stuff

00:22:02.525 --> 00:22:04.929
that you would typically think about.

00:22:04.953 --> 00:22:08.408
Many other companies in Silicon Valley
have weighed in in the same way.

00:22:08.432 --> 00:22:11.387
I think similarly,
we've been thinking through

00:22:11.411 --> 00:22:17.172
how we can use tools like
the community mobility reports.

00:22:17.196 --> 00:22:18.406
This is something,

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.634
a business backer
like we have for restaurants.

00:22:20.658 --> 00:22:23.694
The engineers and scientists said,

00:22:23.718 --> 00:22:29.153
what if we applied that to retail
and grocery stores and transportation

00:22:29.177 --> 00:22:31.272
to get a snapshot in a community

00:22:31.296 --> 00:22:34.999
of whether people
were using those areas less,

00:22:35.023 --> 00:22:38.748
whether people were adhering
to local public health expectations

00:22:38.772 --> 00:22:41.376
and sheltering in place,

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.813
and give that information
not only to public health

00:22:43.837 --> 00:22:44.991
but to the public

00:22:45.015 --> 00:22:48.059
to help inspire them
to do more for their community

00:22:48.083 --> 00:22:49.829
as well as for themselves.

00:22:49.853 --> 00:22:53.099
So there has been, I think
what I'm trying to say, Whitney,

00:22:53.123 --> 00:22:54.966
is I think there's a natural marriage,

00:22:54.990 --> 00:23:00.457
and COVID has been an accelerant use case
to demonstrate how that can work,

00:23:00.481 --> 00:23:06.539
and it is my expectation
that companies like Google

00:23:06.563 --> 00:23:10.266
who, certainly for us it's in our DNA
to be involved in health,

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:13.289
will want to continue
working on this going forward,

00:23:13.313 --> 00:23:17.969
because it's really not just good for what
we need to get done in this pandemic,

00:23:17.993 --> 00:23:20.468
but public health and prevention

00:23:20.492 --> 00:23:24.258
are part and parcel
of how we create opportunity

00:23:24.282 --> 00:23:27.547
and equity in all communities
across the world.

00:23:27.571 --> 00:23:30.246
So I'm passionate about
the work of public health

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.183
and very passionate about partnership.

00:23:32.207 --> 00:23:33.660
Can I just say one more thing?

00:23:33.684 --> 00:23:35.051
WPR: Absolutely.

00:23:35.075 --> 00:23:36.296
KD: Which is to say

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.577
that one of the first things that I did
before the pandemic started,

00:23:39.601 --> 00:23:41.249
I had just started in December,

00:23:41.273 --> 00:23:44.637
and then in January, I did
a listening session with consumers

00:23:44.661 --> 00:23:45.950
about what they wanted,

00:23:45.974 --> 00:23:48.679
and they said something
kind of similar to what you said,

00:23:48.703 --> 00:23:50.218
which I just want to call out,

00:23:50.242 --> 00:23:51.417
and that is,

00:23:51.441 --> 00:23:54.813
they wanted partnership,
they wanted transparency

00:23:54.837 --> 00:23:57.136
and they really felt like
there was quite a lot

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.335
that tech in general could do

00:23:59.359 --> 00:24:01.430
to help them on their health journey.

00:24:01.454 --> 00:24:04.693
But their ask was that we did it
in a transparent way

00:24:04.717 --> 00:24:07.868
and we did it in a partnered
way with them.

00:24:07.892 --> 00:24:11.644
And so as we move out of the pandemic,
and we're thinking more about consumers,

00:24:11.668 --> 00:24:13.760
I want to carry some of this spirit also

00:24:13.784 --> 00:24:15.245
of prevention and helpfulness

00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:17.669
and transparency

00:24:17.693 --> 00:24:21.298
into the work that we're going to continue
to do for people every day.
