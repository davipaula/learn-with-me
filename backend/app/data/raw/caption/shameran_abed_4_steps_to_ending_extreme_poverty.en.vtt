00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:15.984
We are witness to monumental
human progress.

00:00:16.452 --> 00:00:19.885
Over the past few decades,
the expansion of the global marketplace

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:24.690
has lifted a third of the world's
population out of extreme poverty.

00:00:24.714 --> 00:00:27.693
Yet we are also witness
to an astounding failure.

00:00:28.222 --> 00:00:29.988
Our efforts to lift people up

00:00:30.012 --> 00:00:33.474
have left behind those
in the harshest forms of poverty,

00:00:33.498 --> 00:00:35.019
the ultra-poor.

00:00:35.043 --> 00:00:39.164
What it means to be ultra-poor
goes beyond the monetary definition

00:00:39.188 --> 00:00:41.042
that we're all familiar with:

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.236
living on less than two dollars a day.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.847
It goes even beyond not having assets

00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:48.910
like livestock or land.

00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:53.002
To be ultra-poor means
to be stripped of your dignity,

00:00:53.026 --> 00:00:54.658
purpose and self-worth.

00:00:55.114 --> 00:00:57.085
It means living in isolation,

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.430
because you're a burden
to your own community.

00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:03.321
It means being unable
to imagine a better future

00:01:03.345 --> 00:01:05.004
for yourself and your family.

00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:07.764
By the end of 2019,

00:01:07.788 --> 00:01:12.694
about 400 million people
were living in ultra-poverty worldwide.

00:01:12.718 --> 00:01:17.325
That's more than the populations
of the United States and Canada combined.

00:01:18.071 --> 00:01:19.742
And when calamity strikes,

00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:24.299
whether it's a pandemic,
a natural disaster or a manmade crisis,

00:01:24.323 --> 00:01:27.188
these numbers spike astronomically higher.

00:01:28.038 --> 00:01:31.814
My father, Fazle Abed,
gave up a corporate career

00:01:31.838 --> 00:01:35.717
to establish BRAC
here in Bangladesh in 1972.

00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:37.572
Bangladesh was a wreck,

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:40.522
having just gone through
a devastating cyclone

00:01:40.546 --> 00:01:43.365
followed by a brutal war for independence.

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:47.432
Working with the poorest of the poor,
my father realized

00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:51.617
that poverty was more
than the lack of income and assets.

00:01:51.641 --> 00:01:54.171
It was also a lack of hope.

00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:57.049
People were trapped in poverty,

00:01:57.073 --> 00:02:00.796
because they felt
their condition was immutable.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.828
Poverty, to them,
was like the sun and the moon --

00:02:03.852 --> 00:02:06.176
something given to them by God.

00:02:06.703 --> 00:02:09.621
For poverty reduction programs to succeed,

00:02:09.645 --> 00:02:12.675
they would need to instill
hope and self-worth

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.807
so that, with a little support,

00:02:14.831 --> 00:02:17.277
people could lift themselves
out of poverty.

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:21.128
BRAC went on to pioneer
the graduation approach,

00:02:21.152 --> 00:02:25.233
a solution to ultra-poverty
that addresses both income poverty

00:02:25.257 --> 00:02:26.979
and the poverty of hope.

00:02:27.487 --> 00:02:29.883
The approach works primarily with women,

00:02:29.907 --> 00:02:33.141
because women are
the most affected by ultra-poverty

00:02:33.165 --> 00:02:36.504
but also the ones most likely
to pull themselves and their families

00:02:36.528 --> 00:02:37.680
out of it.

00:02:37.704 --> 00:02:39.337
Over a two-year period,

00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:41.428
we essentially do four things.

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.989
One, we meet a woman's basic needs

00:02:45.013 --> 00:02:47.508
by giving her food or cash,

00:02:47.532 --> 00:02:50.112
ensuring the minimum to survive.

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:53.362
Two, we move her
towards a decent livelihood

00:02:53.386 --> 00:02:56.269
by giving her an asset, like livestock,

00:02:56.293 --> 00:02:59.057
and training her to earn money from it.

00:02:59.081 --> 00:03:02.355
Three, we train her to save, budget

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.248
and invest her new wealth.

00:03:04.272 --> 00:03:07.820
And four, we help
to integrate her socially,

00:03:07.844 --> 00:03:10.180
first into groups of women like her

00:03:10.204 --> 00:03:12.057
and then into her community.

00:03:12.573 --> 00:03:16.247
Each of these elements
is key to the success of the others,

00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:20.009
but the real magic is the hope
and sense of possibility

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:23.602
the women develop through
the close mentorship they receive.

00:03:24.098 --> 00:03:26.469
Let me tell you about Jorina.

00:03:26.493 --> 00:03:30.933
Jorina was born in a remote village
in northern Bangladesh.

00:03:30.957 --> 00:03:32.449
She never went to school,

00:03:32.473 --> 00:03:36.647
and at the age of 15,
she was married off to an abusive husband.

00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:38.710
He eventually abandoned her,

00:03:38.734 --> 00:03:40.514
leaving her with no income

00:03:40.538 --> 00:03:45.047
and two children who were not in school
and were severely malnourished.

00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:47.336
With no one to turn to for help,

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.828
she had no hope.

00:03:49.366 --> 00:03:53.534
Jorina joined BRAC's
Graduation program in 2005.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.999
She received a dollar a week,

00:03:56.023 --> 00:03:57.182
two cows,

00:03:57.206 --> 00:03:58.757
enterprise training

00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:01.019
and a weekly visit from a mentor.

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:03.464
She began to build her assets,

00:04:03.488 --> 00:04:05.183
but most importantly,

00:04:05.207 --> 00:04:09.100
she began to imagine a better future
for herself and her children.

00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:12.456
If you were visit Jorina's village today,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.426
you would find that she runs
the largest general store in her area.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.926
She will proudly show you
the land she bought

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.509
and the house she built.

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:24.345
Since we began this program in 2002,

00:04:24.369 --> 00:04:26.281
two million Bangladeshi women

00:04:26.305 --> 00:04:30.163
have lifted themselves and their families
out of ultra-poverty.

00:04:30.187 --> 00:04:32.526
That's almost nine million people.

00:04:33.026 --> 00:04:36.623
The program, which costs
500 dollars per household,

00:04:36.647 --> 00:04:38.356
runs for only two years,

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.964
but the impact goes well beyond that.

00:04:40.988 --> 00:04:44.031
Researchers at the London
School of Economics found

00:04:44.055 --> 00:04:46.906
that even seven years
after entering the program,

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.464
92 percent of participants
had maintained or increased

00:04:51.488 --> 00:04:53.992
their income, assets and consumption.

00:04:54.531 --> 00:04:56.798
Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee,

00:04:56.822 --> 00:05:00.239
the MIT economists who won
the Nobel Prize last year,

00:05:00.263 --> 00:05:02.649
led multicountry evaluations

00:05:02.673 --> 00:05:06.594
that identified graduation
as one of the most effective ways

00:05:06.618 --> 00:05:08.373
to break the poverty trap.

00:05:08.742 --> 00:05:10.785
But my father wasn't content

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:14.066
to have found a solution
that worked for some people.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.616
He always wanted to know
whether we were being ambitious enough

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.013
in terms of scale.

00:05:19.037 --> 00:05:22.776
So when we achieved
nationwide scale in Bangladesh,

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.900
he wanted to know
how we could scale it globally.

00:05:26.313 --> 00:05:28.967
And that has to involve governments.

00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:31.781
Governments already dedicate
billions of dollars

00:05:31.805 --> 00:05:34.251
on poverty reduction programs.

00:05:34.275 --> 00:05:36.832
But so much of that money is wasted,

00:05:36.856 --> 00:05:39.993
because these programs
either don't reach the poorest,

00:05:40.017 --> 00:05:44.474
and even the ones that do
fail to have significant long-term impact.

00:05:45.085 --> 00:05:47.739
We are working to engage governments

00:05:47.763 --> 00:05:52.201
to help them to adopt and scale
graduation programs themselves,

00:05:52.225 --> 00:05:56.128
maximizing the impact
of the billions of dollars

00:05:56.152 --> 00:05:59.179
they already allocate
to fight ultra-poverty.

00:05:59.898 --> 00:06:03.858
Our plan is to help
another 21 million people

00:06:03.882 --> 00:06:06.349
lift themselves out of ultra-poverty

00:06:06.373 --> 00:06:09.577
in eight countries over the next six years

00:06:09.601 --> 00:06:13.753
with BRAC teams on-site
and embedded in each country.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.814
In July of 2019, my father was diagnosed
with terminal brain cancer

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:21.722
and given four months to live.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.534
As he transitioned out of BRAC after
leading the organization for 47 years,

00:06:27.558 --> 00:06:30.529
he reminded us that throughout his life,

00:06:30.553 --> 00:06:33.806
he saw optimism triumph over despair,

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.154
that when you light the spark
of self-belief in people,

00:06:37.178 --> 00:06:40.576
even the poorest
can transform their lives.

00:06:41.375 --> 00:06:43.542
My father passed away in December.

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:48.523
He lit that spark for millions of people,

00:06:48.547 --> 00:06:50.558
and in the final days of his life,

00:06:50.582 --> 00:06:55.346
he implored us to continue to do so
for millions more.

00:06:55.887 --> 00:06:58.971
This opportunity is ours for the taking,

00:06:58.995 --> 00:07:02.466
so let's stop imagining
a world without ultra-poverty

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.325
and start building that world together.

00:07:05.707 --> 00:07:06.944
Thank you.
