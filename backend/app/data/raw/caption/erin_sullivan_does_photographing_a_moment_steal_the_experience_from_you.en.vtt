00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:17.181
What is the most beautiful place
you have ever been?

00:00:17.778 --> 00:00:20.624
And when you were there,
did you take a picture of it?

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.761
Here's a place that tops that list for me.

00:00:23.785 --> 00:00:27.252
This is Mesa Arch
in Canyonlands National Park in Utah

00:00:27.276 --> 00:00:28.431
at sunrise.

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:31.090
It's the traditional homeland
of the Pueblo, Ute,

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:33.005
Paiute and Navajo people,

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:34.643
and when you are there,

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.452
it is absolutely stunning.

00:00:36.476 --> 00:00:39.573
The sunrise illuminates
the bottom of the arch orange,

00:00:39.597 --> 00:00:43.798
and then behind it you see the buttes
and clouds and cliffs.

00:00:43.822 --> 00:00:46.009
But what you might not see
from my photo here

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:49.587
is the 30 people behind me
who were also taking photos.

00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:52.842
And these are just the committed people,
the sunrise people, right?

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.477
So when you think about that,

00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:59.852
there must be hundreds if not thousands
of photos of Mesa Arch taken every week.

00:00:59.876 --> 00:01:03.138
I've been sharing my photography
on Instagram for years,

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:07.745
and it started to become
really interesting and funny, even,

00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:11.347
just how many similar photos
of the same places

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:13.101
I started to see online.

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:14.872
And I was participating in it.

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:17.090
So this made me wonder:

00:01:17.114 --> 00:01:20.215
Why are we taking photos
in the first place?

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:23.021
Sometimes, I visit a popular landmark --

00:01:23.045 --> 00:01:26.088
this one is Horseshoe Bend in Arizona --

00:01:26.112 --> 00:01:28.862
and I see all the people
with their phones and cameras out

00:01:28.886 --> 00:01:30.054
who snap a photo,

00:01:30.078 --> 00:01:33.335
just to turn and get back in the car
or walk back to the trailhead.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:37.187
And sometimes it seems like
we are missing the point

00:01:37.211 --> 00:01:41.582
of going to this place
to experience it for ourselves

00:01:41.606 --> 00:01:44.194
or to see it with our own eyes.

00:01:44.858 --> 00:01:46.361
When I'm behind the camera,

00:01:46.385 --> 00:01:48.987
I notice the smallest details:

00:01:49.011 --> 00:01:51.719
the layers of light in the mountains

00:01:51.743 --> 00:01:54.193
as the light fades at the end of the day;

00:01:54.217 --> 00:01:57.471
the shapes that nature so expertly makes,

00:01:57.495 --> 00:02:00.141
abstract and yet completely perfect.

00:02:00.978 --> 00:02:04.588
I could go on and on here musing
about the intricacies of this planet

00:02:04.612 --> 00:02:06.462
and the way that it makes me feel.

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:10.722
Photographing the beauty
and complexity of this world

00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:13.544
for me is like making a portrait
of someone that I love.

00:02:14.164 --> 00:02:15.574
And when I make a photograph,

00:02:15.598 --> 00:02:18.321
I have to think about
what I want it to say.

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:21.903
I have to ask myself
what I want it to feel like.

00:02:21.927 --> 00:02:24.033
When you're communicating
through an image,

00:02:24.057 --> 00:02:25.872
every creative choice matters.

00:02:25.896 --> 00:02:27.893
Sometimes, I plan to share my images,

00:02:27.917 --> 00:02:30.022
and other times, I take them
just for myself.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.421
I currently host a video series
on the future of the outdoors,

00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:36.287
and for one of the episodes
we wanted to explore

00:02:36.311 --> 00:02:39.864
the relationship between
photography and outdoor spaces.

00:02:39.888 --> 00:02:42.019
I learned about the research
of Kristin Diehl

00:02:42.043 --> 00:02:43.529
and her colleagues at USC,

00:02:43.553 --> 00:02:46.701
who studied photo-taking's
effect on enjoyment levels.

00:02:46.725 --> 00:02:49.135
They found that when we're
behind the camera,

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.055
when we're the ones taking the picture,

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.656
we enjoy our experiences more, not less.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.224
But it wasn't true all the time.

00:02:55.248 --> 00:02:59.059
If the person took the photo
solely with the intention of sharing it,

00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:00.784
there was no increase in enjoyment,

00:03:00.808 --> 00:03:03.038
because they didn't do it for themselves.

00:03:03.062 --> 00:03:05.480
So this points to
an important distinction:

00:03:05.504 --> 00:03:07.913
photography can enhance your experience

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:09.745
if it's done intentionally.

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.242
The intention piece is what matters.

00:03:12.691 --> 00:03:15.806
As a photographer, I've really
had to check myself on this.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.371
When does it help me
to have my camera out,

00:03:18.395 --> 00:03:20.639
and when do I just need to put it away?

00:03:20.663 --> 00:03:25.298
On a trip to Alaska, I had the opportunity
to photograph Alaskan brown bears.

00:03:25.322 --> 00:03:27.632
I was on a boat with
four other photographers,

00:03:27.656 --> 00:03:30.129
and we were all having our minds blown

00:03:30.153 --> 00:03:31.396
at the same time

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.980
in such close proximity to these animals.

00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:36.184
It's an emotional experience.

00:03:36.208 --> 00:03:39.545
Being eye to eye with these bears
gave me a feeling of connection

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.109
that transcends words,

00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:45.288
and having my camera with me
in this case enhanced that.

00:03:45.698 --> 00:03:49.338
We were all creating independently
but also all completely in the moment,

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:51.350
both with nature and with each other.

00:03:51.374 --> 00:03:52.840
I so clearly remember

00:03:52.864 --> 00:03:56.431
capturing the water droplets
and the motion as the bears swam

00:03:56.455 --> 00:03:59.048
and the cute cubs following their mothers.

00:03:59.793 --> 00:04:02.482
That group and I will have
that experience together

00:04:02.506 --> 00:04:04.393
and these images to look back on

00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:05.589
time and time again,

00:04:05.613 --> 00:04:09.414
and photography is what enabled us
to share this in the first place.

00:04:10.518 --> 00:04:12.935
Other times, I choose
to leave the camera behind,

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.797
and I think that choice ultimately
improves both my experience

00:04:16.821 --> 00:04:18.097
and my work.

00:04:18.672 --> 00:04:21.752
I recently flew to
the South Pacific island of Tonga

00:04:21.776 --> 00:04:23.413
to swim with humpback whales.

00:04:23.887 --> 00:04:26.264
I noticed myself feeling pressure

00:04:26.288 --> 00:04:29.146
and a certain obligation
to take the camera with me,

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.346
when sometimes I just wanted
the pure experience itself.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.796
And the experience is seriously amazing.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.705
You're talking about being in the water

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.493
with a curious baby animal
the size of a station wagon

00:04:39.517 --> 00:04:43.272
while you are surrounded by particles
that float around you like glitter,

00:04:43.296 --> 00:04:46.044
and the mom swims gracefully below you.

00:04:46.068 --> 00:04:49.093
There were times, obviously,
when I did take my camera with me,

00:04:49.117 --> 00:04:52.080
and those were really amazing
to capture as well.

00:04:52.104 --> 00:04:53.976
But the setup is pretty big.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.503
It's like this big box.
This is what it looks like.

00:04:56.527 --> 00:04:58.583
And so this is between me and the whales,

00:04:58.607 --> 00:05:02.270
and at times that feels like a block
between you and reality.

00:05:02.294 --> 00:05:04.605
Is there a difference
when it's just your phone?

00:05:05.135 --> 00:05:07.658
Last year, I went to Uluru
in Central Australia,

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:11.087
which is this massive rock
that towers over the desert.

00:05:11.666 --> 00:05:14.521
This is sacred land to Anangu,

00:05:14.545 --> 00:05:16.633
who are the Aboriginal
people from this area

00:05:16.657 --> 00:05:18.933
and the traditional owners of the land.

00:05:19.455 --> 00:05:23.903
There are particular spots in Uluru
that you cannot photograph professionally,

00:05:23.927 --> 00:05:26.484
because they are culturally sensitive,

00:05:26.508 --> 00:05:29.470
equivalent to sacred scripture to Anangu.

00:05:29.494 --> 00:05:34.032
So because of this, most of my photographs
are from either far away, like this one,

00:05:34.056 --> 00:05:36.961
or from specific angles in the park.

00:05:36.985 --> 00:05:41.490
You could say that some of the most
interesting and beautiful visuals in Uluru

00:05:41.514 --> 00:05:43.926
are located in these sensitive areas,

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:49.511
but the request not to photograph them
is an explicit and direct invitation

00:05:49.535 --> 00:05:53.624
to learn more about the land,
its importance and its people.

00:05:53.648 --> 00:05:55.913
Isn't that what we should be doing anyway?

00:05:55.937 --> 00:05:58.963
So my visit to Uluru
quickly became not about me

00:05:58.987 --> 00:06:02.171
but about connecting with the place.

00:06:02.983 --> 00:06:04.465
Ironically and unsurprisingly,

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:06.622
I have found that presence and connection

00:06:06.646 --> 00:06:09.849
also happens to make
for more compelling images.

00:06:10.413 --> 00:06:12.775
We can probably all point to social media

00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:16.728
as being a good place to share the images
from our travels and from our lives.

00:06:17.255 --> 00:06:20.144
We not only share pieces
of the world that we have seen

00:06:20.168 --> 00:06:22.640
but also parts of our
day-to-day experiences.

00:06:22.664 --> 00:06:26.507
And if we're applying intentionality
to the photos we take,

00:06:26.531 --> 00:06:29.631
then hopefully we're sharing
intentionally too.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.466
For me, allowing people to see pieces
of my story and my perspective online

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.228
has reminded me that I'm not alone.

00:06:38.252 --> 00:06:40.475
It's helped me build support and community

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:42.252
to do the same for others.

00:06:43.212 --> 00:06:44.382
Let me be clear:

00:06:44.406 --> 00:06:48.017
I am not trying to discourage you
from taking photos.

00:06:48.688 --> 00:06:52.431
Even if thousands of people
have been to whatever exact location

00:06:52.455 --> 00:06:54.583
and taken whatever exact photo,

00:06:54.607 --> 00:06:56.936
I encourage you to get out and create too.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.286
The world needs every
voice and perspective,

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.862
and yours is included.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.858
But what I'm trying to show you
is that the phone or camera

00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:06.799
doesn't have to stay out all the time.

00:07:07.376 --> 00:07:09.221
What I'm trying to encourage you to do

00:07:09.245 --> 00:07:11.782
is to put it away, just for a moment --

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:13.238
a moment for you.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:15.351
So let's go back to Mesa Arch,

00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:17.694
the way that the rock glows orange

00:07:17.718 --> 00:07:21.140
and the lovely layers of blue
in the background.

00:07:21.846 --> 00:07:24.624
What if the next time
you were somewhere amazing,

00:07:24.648 --> 00:07:27.005
you couldn't bring your camera or phone?

00:07:27.601 --> 00:07:30.487
What if you were not allowed
to take any pictures at all?

00:07:31.035 --> 00:07:32.859
Would it feel like a limitation?

00:07:33.618 --> 00:07:35.888
Or would it feel like a relief?

00:07:36.983 --> 00:07:38.159
So what can we do?

00:07:38.183 --> 00:07:42.017
Well, the next time you feel the impulse
to take out your camera or phone,

00:07:42.041 --> 00:07:45.342
or, in my case, once you realize
you have already pulled it out --

00:07:45.366 --> 00:07:46.446
(Laughter)

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:47.875
First: stop.

00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:49.879
Pause.

00:07:49.903 --> 00:07:51.236
Take a deep breath.

00:07:52.148 --> 00:07:54.187
Look around. What do you notice?

00:07:56.045 --> 00:07:58.716
Are you experiencing
this moment with someone else?

00:07:59.191 --> 00:08:01.867
Remember that this moment only comes once.

00:08:02.267 --> 00:08:05.280
Photography can be part
of a beautiful experience.

00:08:05.304 --> 00:08:08.503
Just don't let it be a block
between you and reality.

00:08:08.527 --> 00:08:09.940
Be intentional,

00:08:09.964 --> 00:08:13.594
and don't lose a beautiful,
irreplaceable memory,

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:16.198
because you were too focused
on getting the shot.

00:08:16.677 --> 00:08:17.911
Thank you.

00:08:17.935 --> 00:08:20.758
(Applause)
