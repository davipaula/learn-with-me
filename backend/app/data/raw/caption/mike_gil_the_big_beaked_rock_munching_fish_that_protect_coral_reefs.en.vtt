00:00:07.355 --> 00:00:13.084
As the sun rises over a quiet coral reef, 
one animal breaks the morning silence.

00:00:13.084 --> 00:00:16.394
Named for their vibrant scales 
and beak-like teeth,

00:00:16.394 --> 00:00:22.613
these parrotfish are devouring 
a particularly crunchy breakfast: rocks.

00:00:22.613 --> 00:00:26.773
It may not be immediately clear 
why any creature would take bites

00:00:26.773 --> 00:00:28.199
out of the seafloor.

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.630
But the diet of these flashy foragers 
actually plays a key role

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.314
in defending the coral reef’s 
complex ecosystem.

00:00:36.314 --> 00:00:40.490
Massive coral reefs 
begin with tiny coral larvae,

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.920
which settle on the seafloor’s 
hard surfaces

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.060
and metamorphasize into coral polyps.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.780
Over time, these polyps 
generate rock-like skeletons

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.520
made of calcium carbonate.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.030
Together, colonies of polyps produce 
large three-dimensional structures,

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.845
which form the basis 
of an underwater metropolis.

00:00:59.845 --> 00:01:03.335
These coral complexes are full 
of nooks and crannies

00:01:03.335 --> 00:01:06.301
that house and protect 
countless life forms.

00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:10.585
Even though coral reefs occupy less than 
one percent of the ocean floor,

00:01:10.585 --> 00:01:16.366
these dense ecosystems are home to more 
than twenty-five percent of marine life.

00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:22.262
Many fish use corals as shelters for 
sleeping and to hide from large predators

00:01:22.262 --> 00:01:24.922
between their trips foraging for seaweed.

00:01:24.922 --> 00:01:29.234
As the primary food source for many 
of the reef’s fish and invertebrates,

00:01:29.234 --> 00:01:31.684
seaweed is vital to this ecosystem.

00:01:31.684 --> 00:01:35.084
But in high densities, 
seaweed can become problematic,

00:01:35.084 --> 00:01:37.194
and even lethal to corals.

00:01:37.194 --> 00:01:42.398
Seaweed grows on the same hard open 
surfaces that coral larvae rely on,

00:01:42.398 --> 00:01:46.658
and their growth prevents new coral 
from settling and expanding.

00:01:46.658 --> 00:01:51.952
These competitors have also evolved 
a variety of ways to kill existing corals,

00:01:51.952 --> 00:01:54.142
including smothering and abrasion.

00:01:54.142 --> 00:01:57.974
Some seaweed species 
even engage in chemical warfare—

00:01:57.974 --> 00:02:02.094
synthesizing compounds 
that destroy coral on contact.

00:02:02.094 --> 00:02:04.257
This is where parrotfish come in.

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:08.344
Like many reef fish, 
these colorful creatures eat seaweed.

00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:10.034
But unlike their neighbors,

00:02:10.034 --> 00:02:14.762
parrotfish can completely remove 
even the tiniest scraps of seaweed

00:02:14.762 --> 00:02:16.207
from the ocean floor.

00:02:16.207 --> 00:02:21.199
Their so-called beak is actually a mosaic 
of tightly-packed teeth

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:23.609
which can scrape and grind rock,

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:28.688
allowing them to consume every bit 
of seaweed covering a stony surface.

00:02:28.688 --> 00:02:32.428
This helps parrotfish reach seaweed 
other fish can’t consume,

00:02:32.428 --> 00:02:36.202
while simultaneously clearing out 
open space for new corals

00:02:36.202 --> 00:02:39.992
to settle and existing colonies to expand.

00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:43.892
Eating rocks is just one way parrotfish 
help manage seaweed.

00:02:43.892 --> 00:02:46.252
Through a dynamic system 
of social networks,

00:02:46.252 --> 00:02:50.564
parrotfish can convey information 
to other coral dwelling fish.

00:02:50.564 --> 00:02:55.572
Each fish’s presence and simple routine 
behaviors produce sensory information

00:02:55.572 --> 00:02:59.132
that nearby fish can see, hear, or smell.

00:02:59.132 --> 00:03:03.172
They can even detect changes in water 
pressure produced by their neighbors

00:03:03.172 --> 00:03:05.682
using a special sensory organ.

00:03:05.682 --> 00:03:09.692
All these factors can inform 
the behavior of nearby fish.

00:03:09.692 --> 00:03:13.712
For example, a fish safely entering 
an open feeding ground

00:03:13.712 --> 00:03:17.072
and not getting attacked 
means it’s safe to forage.

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:21.905
Conversely, a fish rapidly leaving 
a location can provide an early warning

00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:23.935
that a threat is approaching.

00:03:23.935 --> 00:03:25.742
By simply trying to stay alive,

00:03:25.742 --> 00:03:29.612
these reef fish can incidentally help 
their neighbors survive—

00:03:29.612 --> 00:03:32.519
and more of these fish 
means less seaweed.

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.209
Unfortunately, human activities 
over the last several decades

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.769
have disrupted almost every part 
of this complex system.

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.189
In many coral reefs, overfishing 
has reduced the number of parrotfish,

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:48.709
as well as other seaweed eaters, 
such as surgeonfish and rabbitfish.

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.434
This has led to unchecked seaweed growth,

00:03:51.434 --> 00:03:54.879
which threatens to degrade 
entire coral reefs.

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.349
The parrotfish that remain 
live in much smaller communities.

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.259
Their reduced numbers 
can weaken their social network,

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:06.268
making surviving fish more timid 
and less effective at controlling seaweed.

00:04:06.268 --> 00:04:10.722
Today, climate change and pollution 
are lowering coral’s natural defenses

00:04:10.722 --> 00:04:13.482
while contributing to runaway 
seaweed growth—

00:04:13.482 --> 00:04:17.362
leaving reef ecosystems 
more fragile than ever.

00:04:17.362 --> 00:04:21.482
Our reefs are vitally important 
to both marine and human life.

00:04:21.482 --> 00:04:26.267
Their unparalleled biodiversity offers 
unique opportunities for ecotourism,

00:04:26.267 --> 00:04:29.157
sustainable fishing, 
and scientific research,

00:04:29.157 --> 00:04:34.028
while their rocky structures guard 
coastlines from waves and storm surges.

00:04:34.028 --> 00:04:37.348
Fortunately, continued research 
into reef species

00:04:37.348 --> 00:04:41.478
like the quirky and critical parrotfish 
can inform new strategies

00:04:41.478 --> 00:04:44.129
for preserving these essential ecosystems.
