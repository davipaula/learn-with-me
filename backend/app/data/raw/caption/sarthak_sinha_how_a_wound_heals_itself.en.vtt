00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:11.408
The largest organ in your body
isn't your liver or your brain.

00:00:11.408 --> 00:00:16.284
It's your skin, with a surface area
of about 20 square feet in adults.

00:00:16.284 --> 00:00:19.420
Though different areas of the skin
have different characteristics,

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.035
much of this surface performs
similar functions,

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:26.152
such as sweating, feeling heat and cold,
and growing hair.

00:00:26.152 --> 00:00:28.105
But after a deep cut or wound,

00:00:28.105 --> 00:00:31.746
the newly healed skin will look different
from the surrounding area,

00:00:31.746 --> 00:00:36.481
and may not fully regain all 
its abilities for a while, or at all.

00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:41.097
To understand why this happens, we need to
look at the structure of the human skin.

00:00:41.097 --> 00:00:43.045
The top layer, called the epidermis,

00:00:43.045 --> 00:00:47.219
consists mostly of hardened cells,
called keratinocytes,

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.135
and provides protection.

00:00:49.135 --> 00:00:52.192
Since its outer layer is constantly being
shed and renewed,

00:00:52.192 --> 00:00:54.085
it's pretty easy to repair.

00:00:54.085 --> 00:00:57.244
But sometimes a wound penetrates
into the dermis,

00:00:57.244 --> 00:01:00.664
which contains blood vessels
and the various glands and nerve endings

00:01:00.664 --> 00:01:03.565
that enable the skin's many functions.

00:01:03.565 --> 00:01:06.753
And when that happens, it triggers the
four overlapping stages

00:01:06.753 --> 00:01:09.798
of the regenerative process.

00:01:09.798 --> 00:01:14.840
The first stage, hemostasis, is the skin's
response to two immediate threats:

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.446
that you're now losing blood

00:01:16.446 --> 00:01:20.256
and that the physical barrier of 
the epidermis has been compromised.

00:01:20.256 --> 00:01:23.007
As the blood vessels tighten to minimize
the bleeding,

00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:25.258
in a process known as 
vasoconstriction,

00:01:25.258 --> 00:01:28.952
both threats are averted by forming
a blood clot.

00:01:28.952 --> 00:01:33.140
A special protein known as fibrin forms
cross-links on the top of the skin,

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.449
preventing blood from flowing out
and bacteria or pathogens from getting in.

00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:41.902
After about three hours of this,
the skin begins to turn red,

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:44.828
signaling the next stage, inflammation.

00:01:44.828 --> 00:01:47.726
With bleeding under control
and the barrier secured,

00:01:47.726 --> 00:01:52.079
the body sends special cells to fight any
pathogens that may have gotten through.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.963
Among the most important of these
are white blood cells,

00:01:54.963 --> 00:01:56.732
known as macrophages,

00:01:56.732 --> 00:02:02.004
which devour bacteria and damage tissue
through a process known as phagocytosis,

00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:05.718
in addition to producing growth factors
to spur healing.

00:02:05.718 --> 00:02:08.082
And because these tiny soldiers 
need to travel

00:02:08.082 --> 00:02:10.187
through the blood to 
get to the wound site,

00:02:10.187 --> 00:02:13.597
the previously constricted 
blood vessels now expand

00:02:13.597 --> 00:02:16.253
in a process called vasodilation.

00:02:16.253 --> 00:02:18.443
About two to three days after the wound,

00:02:18.443 --> 00:02:23.238
the proliferative stage occurs, when 
fibroblast cells begin to enter the wound.

00:02:23.238 --> 00:02:25.681
In the process of collagen deposition,

00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:29.749
they produce a fibrous protein 
called collagen in the wound site,

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.934
forming connective skin tissue
to replace the fibrin from before.

00:02:33.934 --> 00:02:37.717
As epidermal cells divide to reform
the outer layer of skin,

00:02:37.717 --> 00:02:40.610
the dermis contracts to close the wound.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.217
Finally, in the fourth stage 
of remodeling,

00:02:43.217 --> 00:02:47.601
the wound matures as the newly deposited
collagen is rearranged and converted

00:02:47.601 --> 00:02:49.428
into specific types.

00:02:49.428 --> 00:02:52.116
Through this process,
which can take over a year,

00:02:52.116 --> 00:02:55.231
the tensile strength of the new skin
is improved,

00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:58.639
and blood vessels and other connections
are strengthened.

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:02.104
With time, the new tissue 
can reach from 50-80%

00:03:02.104 --> 00:03:04.566
of some of its original healthy function,

00:03:04.566 --> 00:03:08.818
depending on the severity of the initial 
wound and on the function itself.

00:03:08.818 --> 00:03:11.098
But because the skin
does not fully recover,

00:03:11.098 --> 00:03:15.751
scarring continues to be a major clinical
issue for doctors around the world.

00:03:15.751 --> 00:03:18.592
And even though researchers have made
significant strides

00:03:18.592 --> 00:03:20.693
in understanding the healing process,

00:03:20.693 --> 00:03:23.871
many fundamental mysteries
remain unresolved.

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:27.453
For instance, do fibroblast cells arrive
from the blood vessels

00:03:27.453 --> 00:03:30.039
or from skin tissue adjacent to the wound?

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:32.619
And why do some other mammals, 
such as deer,

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:37.296
heal their wounds much more efficiently
and completely than humans?

00:03:37.296 --> 00:03:39.831
By finding the answers to these questions
and others,

00:03:39.831 --> 00:03:44.794
we may one day be able to heal ourselves
so well that scars will be just a memory.
