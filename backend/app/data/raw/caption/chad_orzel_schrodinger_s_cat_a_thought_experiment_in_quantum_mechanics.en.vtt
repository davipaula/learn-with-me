00:00:07.176 --> 00:00:11.960
Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger is
one of the founders of quantum mechanics,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.237
but he's most famous for something he
never actually did:

00:00:15.237 --> 00:00:17.937
a thought experiment involving a cat.

00:00:17.937 --> 00:00:21.282
He imagined taking a cat and
placing it in a sealed box

00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:26.572
with a device that had a 50% chance
of killing the cat in the next hour.

00:00:26.572 --> 00:00:30.418
At the end of that hour, he asked,
"What is the state of the cat?"

00:00:30.418 --> 00:00:33.788
Common sense suggests that the cat
is either alive or dead,

00:00:33.788 --> 00:00:36.791
but Schrödinger pointed out that according
to quantum physics,

00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:42.421
at the instant before the box is opened,
the cat is equal parts alive and dead,

00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:44.338
at the same time.

00:00:44.338 --> 00:00:48.302
It's only when the box is opened
that we see a single definite state.

00:00:48.302 --> 00:00:51.561
Until then, the cat is 
a blur of probability,

00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:54.230
half one thing and half the other.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.965
This seems absurd, 
which was Schrödinger's point.

00:00:56.965 --> 00:00:59.956
He found quantum physics so 
philosophically disturbing,

00:00:59.956 --> 00:01:02.768
that he abandoned the theory
he had helped make

00:01:02.768 --> 00:01:04.995
and turned to writing about biology.

00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:08.949
As absurd as it may seem, though,
Schrödinger's cat is very real.

00:01:08.949 --> 00:01:10.610
In fact, it's essential.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.328
If it weren't possible for quantum objects
to be in two states at once,

00:01:14.328 --> 00:01:18.575
the computer you're using to watch this
couldn't exist.

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:20.657
The quantum phenomenon of 
superposition

00:01:20.657 --> 00:01:25.708
is a consequence of the dual
particle and wave nature of everything.

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:27.844
In order for an object to have
a wavelength,

00:01:27.844 --> 00:01:30.299
it must extend over some region of space,

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.049
which means it occupies many positions
at the same time.

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.070
The wavelength of an object limited
to a small region of space

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.425
can't be perfectly defined, though.

00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:43.425
So it exists in many different wavelengths
at the same time.

00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:46.459
We don't see these wave properties
for everyday objects

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:50.212
because the wavelength decreases
as the momentum increases.

00:01:50.212 --> 00:01:52.910
And a cat is relatively big and heavy.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.129
If we took a single atom and blew
it up to the size of the Solar System,

00:01:57.129 --> 00:01:59.653
the wavelength of a cat 
running from a physicist

00:01:59.653 --> 00:02:03.319
would be as small as an atom 
within that Solar System.

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.044
That's far too small to detect, so we'll
never see wave behavior from a cat.

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:10.061
A tiny particle, like an electron, though,

00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:13.398
can show dramatic evidence
of its dual nature.

00:02:13.398 --> 00:02:18.602
If we shoot electrons one at a time at a
set of two narrow slits cut in a barrier,

00:02:18.602 --> 00:02:23.912
each electron on the far side is detected
at a single place at a specific instant,

00:02:23.912 --> 00:02:25.295
like a particle.

00:02:25.295 --> 00:02:27.533
But if you repeat this 
experiment many times,

00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:30.360
keeping track of all the 
individual detections,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.643
you'll see them trace out a pattern that's
characteristic of wave behavior:

00:02:34.643 --> 00:02:37.373
a set of stripes - regions with many
electrons

00:02:37.373 --> 00:02:40.061
separated by regions
where there are none at all.

00:02:40.061 --> 00:02:42.867
Block one of the slits 
and the stripes go away.

00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:47.692
This shows that the pattern is a result of
each electron going through both slits

00:02:47.692 --> 00:02:49.790
at the same time.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.672
A single electron isn't choosing 
to go left or right

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:56.076
but left and right simultaneously.

00:02:56.076 --> 00:03:00.029
This superposition of states also leads
to modern technology.

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:05.491
An electron near the nucleus of an atom
exists in a spread out, wave-like orbit.

00:03:05.491 --> 00:03:07.135
Bring two atoms close together,

00:03:07.135 --> 00:03:10.416
and the electrons don't need to 
choose just one atom

00:03:10.416 --> 00:03:12.203
but are shared between them.

00:03:12.203 --> 00:03:14.676
This is how some chemical bonds form.

00:03:14.676 --> 00:03:21.059
An electron in a molecule isn't on
just atom A or atom B, but A+ B.

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:23.875
As you add more atoms,
the electrons spread out more,

00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:27.342
shared between vast numbers of atoms
at the same time.

00:03:27.342 --> 00:03:30.643
The electrons in a solid aren't 
bound to a particular atom

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:35.344
but shared among all of them,
extending over a large range of space.

00:03:35.344 --> 00:03:37.860
This gigantic superposition of states

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.607
determines the ways electrons move
through the material,

00:03:41.607 --> 00:03:45.625
whether it's a conductor or an insulator
or a semiconductor.

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:48.461
Understanding how electrons are shared
among atoms

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:51.947
allows us to precisely control the
properties of semiconductor materials,

00:03:51.947 --> 00:03:53.508
like silicon.

00:03:53.508 --> 00:03:55.919
Combining different semiconductors
in the right way

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.501
allows us to make transistors 
on a tiny scale,

00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:01.863
millions on a single computer chip.

00:04:01.863 --> 00:04:04.065
Those chips and their spread out electrons

00:04:04.065 --> 00:04:07.494
power the computer you're using to
watch this video.

00:04:07.494 --> 00:04:12.185
An old joke says that the Internet 
exists to allow the sharing of cat videos.

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:15.431
At a very deep level, though,
the Internet owes its existance

00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:19.310
to an Austrian physicist
and his imaginary cat.
