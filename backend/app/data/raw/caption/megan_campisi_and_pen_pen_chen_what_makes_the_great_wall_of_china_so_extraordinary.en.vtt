00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:09.599
A 13,000 mile dragon of earth and stone

00:00:09.623 --> 00:00:12.312
winds its way through
the countryside of China

00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:16.423
with a history almost as long
and serpentine as the structure.

00:00:16.447 --> 00:00:19.283
The Great Wall began as multiple walls
of rammed earth

00:00:19.307 --> 00:00:23.236
built by individual feudal states
during the Chunqiu period

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.386
to protect against nomadic raiders
north of China and each other.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.189
When Emperor Qin Shi Huang
unified the states in 221 BCE,

00:00:32.214 --> 00:00:36.458
the Tibetan Plateau and Pacific Ocean
became natural barriers,

00:00:36.482 --> 00:00:38.904
but the mountains in the north
remained vulnerable

00:00:38.928 --> 00:00:42.145
to Mongol, Turkish, and Xiongnu invasions.

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:44.428
To defend against them,

00:00:44.452 --> 00:00:47.517
the Emperor expanded the small walls
built by his predecessors,

00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:50.275
connecting some and fortifying others.

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:53.108
As the structures grew
from Lintao in the west

00:00:53.132 --> 00:00:55.353
to Liaodong in the east,

00:00:55.377 --> 00:00:59.372
they collectively became known
as The Long Wall.

00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:00.784
To accomplish this task,

00:01:00.808 --> 00:01:03.228
the Emperor enlisted soldiers
and commoners,

00:01:03.252 --> 00:01:05.087
not always voluntarily.

00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:09.976
Of the hundreds of thousands of builders
recorded during the Qin Dynasty,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.346
many were forcibly conscripted peasants

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.246
and others were criminals
serving out sentences.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.617
Under the Han Dynasty,
the wall grew longer still,

00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:21.060
reaching 3700 miles,

00:01:21.084 --> 00:01:25.173
and spanning from Dunhuang
to the Bohai Sea.

00:01:25.197 --> 00:01:28.959
Forced labor continued
under the Han Emperor Han-Wudi ,

00:01:28.983 --> 00:01:33.302
and the walls reputation grew
into a notorious place of suffering.

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:36.418
Poems and legends of the time
told of laborers buried

00:01:36.442 --> 00:01:38.251
in nearby mass graves,

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:40.409
or even within the wall itself.

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.981
And while no human remains
have been found inside,

00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:45.803
grave pits do indicate
that many workers died

00:01:45.827 --> 00:01:49.465
from accidents, hunger and exhaustion.

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:53.132
The wall was formidable
but not invincible.

00:01:53.156 --> 00:01:56.516
Both Genghis and his son Khublai Khan
managed to surmount the wall

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.637
during the Mongol invasion
of the 13th Century.

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:03.667
After the Ming dynasty
gained control in 1368,

00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:07.234
they began to refortify
and further consolidate the wall

00:02:07.258 --> 00:02:09.901
using bricks and stones from local kilns.

00:02:09.925 --> 00:02:13.698
Averaging 23 feet high and 21 feet wide,

00:02:13.722 --> 00:02:18.860
the walls 5500 miles
were punctuated by watchtowers.

00:02:18.884 --> 00:02:20.219
When raiders were sighted,

00:02:20.243 --> 00:02:22.886
fire and smoke signals traveled
between towers

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.554
until reinforcements arrived.

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:29.250
Small openings along the wall
let archers fire on invaders,

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:33.140
while larger ones were used
to drop stones and more.

00:02:33.164 --> 00:02:36.670
But even this new and improved wall
was not enough.

00:02:36.694 --> 00:02:41.040
In 1644, northern Manchu clans
overthrew the Ming

00:02:41.064 --> 00:02:43.672
to establish the Qing dynasty,

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:45.956
incorporating Mongolia as well,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.499
Thus, for the second time,

00:02:47.523 --> 00:02:51.484
China was ruled by the very people
the wall had tried to keep out.

00:02:51.508 --> 00:02:54.502
With the empire's borders
now extending beyond the Great Wall,

00:02:54.526 --> 00:02:57.465
the fortifications lost their purpose.

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.961
And without regular reinforcement,
the wall fell into disrepair,

00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:03.307
rammed earth eroded,

00:03:03.331 --> 00:03:06.593
while brick and stone were plundered
for building materials.

00:03:06.617 --> 00:03:08.197
But its job wasn't finished.

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:09.858
During World War II,

00:03:09.882 --> 00:03:12.729
China used sections for defense
against Japanese invasion,

00:03:12.753 --> 00:03:16.798
and some parts are still rumored
to be used for military training.

00:03:16.822 --> 00:03:19.466
But the Wall's main purpose
today is cultural.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.030
As one of the largest man-made
structures on Earth,

00:03:23.054 --> 00:03:27.282
it was granted UNESCO
World Heritage Status in 1987.

00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:29.975
Originally built to keep
people out of China,

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:33.481
the Great Wall now welcomes
millions of visitors each year.

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:37.657
In fact, the influx of tourists
has caused the wall to deteriorate,

00:03:37.681 --> 00:03:40.838
leading the Chinese government
to launch preservation initiatives.

00:03:40.862 --> 00:03:45.875
It's also often acclaimed as the only
man-made structure visible from space.

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:48.518
Unfortunately, that's not at all true.

00:03:48.542 --> 00:03:50.706
In low Earth orbit,
all sorts of structures,

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.684
like bridges, highways
and airports are visible,

00:03:54.708 --> 00:03:57.796
and the Great Wall
is only barely discernible.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.945
From the moon, it doesn't stand a chance.

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:04.132
But regardless, it's the Earth
we should be studying it from

00:04:04.156 --> 00:04:07.506
because new sections
are still discovered every few years,

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.114
branching off from the main body

00:04:09.138 --> 00:04:12.857
and expanding this remarkable
monument to human achievement.
