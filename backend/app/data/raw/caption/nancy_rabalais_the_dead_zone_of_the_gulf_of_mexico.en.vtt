00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.216
Good evening, welcome to New Orleans.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.776
I don't know if you knew this,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.136
but you are sitting within 15 minutes
of one of the largest rivers in the world:

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.440
the Mississippi river.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.800
Old Man River, Big Muddy.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.056
And it goes as far north
as the state of Minnesota,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.416
as far east as the state of New York,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.096
as far west as Montana.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.456
And 100 miles from here, river miles,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.080
it empties its fresh water and sediments
into the Gulf of Mexico.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.256
That's the end of Geography 101.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.376
(Laughter)

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.336
Now we're going to go
to what is in that water.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.320
Besides the sediment, there are dissolved
molecules, nitrogen and phosphorus.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.280
And those, through a biological process,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.800
lead to the formation
of areas called dead zones.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.560
Now, dead zone is a quite ominous word

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.936
if you're a fish or a crab.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.496
(Laughter)

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.496
Even a little worm in the sediments.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.576
Which means that there's not enough oxygen

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.240
for those animals to survive.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.416
So, how does this happen?

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.656
The nitrogen and the phosphorus

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.640
stimulate the growth of microscopic plants
called phytoplankton.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.336
And small animals called zooplankton
eat the phytoplankton,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.296
small fish eat the zooplankton,
large fish eat the small fish

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.096
and it goes on up into the food web.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.656
The problem is that there's just too much
nitrogen and phosphorus right now,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.896
too much phytoplankton
falling to the bottom

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.416
and decomposed by bacteria
that use up the oxygen.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.200
That's the biology.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.256
Now, you can't see it
from the surface of the water,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.736
you can't see it in satellite images,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.936
so how do we know it's there?

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.736
Well, a trawler can tell you,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.096
when she puts her net over the side
and drags for 20 minutes

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.936
and comes up empty,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.256
that she knows she's in the dead zone.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.616
And she has to go somewhere else.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.496
But where else do you go
if this area is 8,000 square miles big?

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.960
About the size of the state of New Jersey.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.136
Well, you either make
a decision to go further,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.456
without much economic return,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.960
or go back to the dock.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.096
As a scientist, I have access
to high-tech equipment

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.976
that we can put over the side
of the research vessel,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.856
and it measures oxygen
and many more things.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.176
We start at the Mississippi River,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.696
we crisscross the Gulf of Mexico
all the way to Texas,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.360
and even I sneak into Texas
every now and then and test their waters.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.296
And you can tell by the bottom oxygen --

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.496
you can draw a map
of everything that's less than two,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.200
which is the magic number
for when the fish start to leave the area.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.960
I also dive in this dead zone.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.016
We have oxygen meters
that we have to deploy offshore

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.440
that tell us continuous measurements
of low oxygen or high oxygen.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.936
And when you get into the water,
there's a lot of fish.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.856
Tons of fish, all kinds of fish,

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.096
including my buddy here,
the barracuda that I saw one day.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.496
Everybody else swam this way
and I went this way with my camera.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.536
(Laughter)

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.176
And then, down at 30 feet
you start to see fewer fish.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.376
And then you get to the bottom.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.616
And you don't see any fish.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.296
There's no life on the platform,
there's no life swimming around.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.800
And you know you're in the dead zone.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.296
So, what's the connection
between the middle of the United States

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.416
and the Gulf of Mexico?

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.800
Well, most of the watershed is farmland.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.480
And in particular, corn-soybean rotation.

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:36.616
The nitrogen that is put in fertilizers
and the phosphorus goes on the land

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.616
and drains off into the Mississippi River

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.840
and ends up in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.256
There's three times more
nitrogen in the water

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.056
in the Mississippi now,

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.296
than there was in the 1950s.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.736
Three times.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.776
And phosphorus has doubled.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.880
And what that means is more phytoplankton
and more sinking sails and lower oxygen.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.000
This is not a natural feature of the Gulf;
it's been caused by human activities.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.656
The landscape is not what it used to be.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.616
It used to be prairies and forests
and prairie potholes

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.736
and duck areas and all kinds of stuff.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.040
But not anymore -- it's row crops.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.736
And there are ways that we can address
this type of agriculture

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:31.056
by using less fertilizer,
maybe precision fertilizing.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.496
And trying some sustainable agriculture

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.056
such as perennial wheatgrass,
which has much longer roots

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.696
than the six inches of a corn plant,

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.320
that can keep the nitrogen on the soil
and keep the soil from running off.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.336
And how do we convince
our neighbors to the north,

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.736
maybe 1,000 miles away or more,

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.800
that their activities are causing problems
with water quality in the Gulf of Mexico?

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.896
First of all, we can take them
to their own backyard.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.496
If you want to go swimming
in Wisconsin in the summer

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.320
in your favorite watering hole,

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.416
you might find something like this

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.936
which looks like spilled green paint
and smells like it,

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.496
growing on the surface of the water.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.376
This is a toxic blue-green algal bloom

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.440
and it is not good for you.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.616
Similarly, in Lake Erie,
couple of summers ago

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.536
there was hundreds of miles
of this blue-green algae

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.896
and the city of Toledo, Ohio,
couldn't use it for their drinking water

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.776
for several days on end.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.536
And if you watch the news,

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:51.480
you know that lots of communities
are having trouble with drinking water.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.176
I'm a scientist.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.296
I don't know if you could tell that.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.560
(Laughter)

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.656
And I do solid science,
I publish my results,

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.080
my colleagues read them,
I get citations of my work.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.720
But I truly believe that, as a scientist,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.656
using mostly federal funds
to do the research,

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.816
I owe it to the public,

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.336
to agency heads and congressional people

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.936
to share my knowledge with them

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.856
so they can use it,
hopefully to make better decisions

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.040
about our environmental policy.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.416
(Applause)

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.696
Thank you.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.416
(Applause)

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.896
One of the ways that I was able to do this
is I brought in the media.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.336
And Joby Warrick
from the "Washington Post"

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.336
put this picture in an article

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.360
on the front page, Sunday morning,
two inches above the fold.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.416
That's a big deal.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.696
And Senator John Breaux, from Louisiana,

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.936
said, "Oh my gosh, that's what they think
the Gulf of Mexico looks like?"

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.616
And I said, "Well, you know,
there's the proof."

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.336
And we've go to do something about it.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.096
At the same time,
Senator Olympia Snowe from Maine

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.016
was having trouble with harmful
algal blooms in the Gulf of Maine.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.936
They joined forces -- it was bipartisan --

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.256
(Laughter)

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.736
(Applause)

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.656
And invited me to give
congressional testimony,

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.736
and I said, "Oh, all I've done
is chase crabs around south Texas,

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.176
I don't know how to do that."

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.416
(Laughter)

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.656
But I did it.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.176
(Cheers)

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.775
And eventually, the bill passed.

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:47.496
And it was called -- yeah, yay!

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.616
It was called The Harmful Algal Bloom

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:55.336
and Hypoxia Research
and Control Act of 1998.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.816
(Laughter)

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.176
(Applause)

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.416
Thank you.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.936
Which is why we call it
the Snowe-Breaux Bill.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.160
(Laughter)

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:12.920
The other thing is
that we had a conference in 2001

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.576
that was put on by
the National Academy of Sciences

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.920
that looked at fertilizers,
nitrogen and poor water quality.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.496
Our plenary speaker
was the former governor

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.360
of the state of New Jersey.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:30.776
And she ...

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:35.656
There was no thinking she wasn't serious
when she peered at the audience,

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.816
and I thought,
"Surely she's looking at me."

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.856
"You know, I'm really tired
of this thing being called New Jersey.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.736
Pick another state, any state,
I just don't want to hear it anymore."

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.416
But she was able to move the action plan

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:56.136
across President George H.W. Bush's desk

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.720
so that we had environmental goals

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.920
and that we were working to solve them.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.040
The Midwest does not feed the world.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:13.616
It feeds a lot of chickens, hogs, cattle

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.896
and it generates ethanol

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.296
to put into our gasoline,

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.320
which is regulated by federal policy.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.640
We can do better than this.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.640
We need to make decisions

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:33.000
that make us less consumptive

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:39.080
and reduce our reliance on nitrogen.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.096
It's like a carbon footprint.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.136
But you can reduce
your nitrogen footprint.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:49.560
I do it by not eating much meat --

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.456
I still like a little
every now and then --

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.960
not using corn oil,

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.656
driving a car that I can put
nonethanol gas in

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.480
and get better gas mileage.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.056
Just things like that
that can make a difference.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.736
So I'm challenging, not just you,

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.176
but I challenge a lot of people,
especially in the Midwest --

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:17.160
think about how you're treating your land
and how you can make a difference.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.000
So my steps are very small steps.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.016
To change the type
of agriculture in the US

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.936
is going to be many big steps.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.720
And it's going to take political
and social will for that to happen.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.680
But we can do it.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.456
I strongly believe
we can translate the science,

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.960
bridge it to policy and make
a difference in our environment.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:47.016
We all want a clean environment.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.616
And we can work together to do this

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:53.936
so that we no longer have
these dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico.
