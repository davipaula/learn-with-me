00:00:12.857 --> 00:00:15.539
Most people think

00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:21.228
that new technology or advanced technology
can never start in Africa.

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:25.853
Instead, they think that the best way
to help the continent advance

00:00:25.877 --> 00:00:28.449
is by providing aid or services

00:00:28.473 --> 00:00:31.123
that the continent
can't provide for itself.

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:35.193
So while we see advanced
technology like robotics

00:00:35.217 --> 00:00:36.560
and artificial intelligence

00:00:36.584 --> 00:00:39.392
growing exponentially
in the developed world,

00:00:39.416 --> 00:00:40.974
those same people are worried

00:00:40.998 --> 00:00:44.105
that a technologically backward
Africa is falling behind.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.000
That attitude couldn't be more wrong.

00:00:49.585 --> 00:00:53.005
I'm a robotics entrepreneur
who's spent a lot of time here in Africa.

00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:57.753
And in 2014 we created Zipline,

00:00:57.777 --> 00:01:01.882
which is a company that uses
electric autonomous aircraft

00:01:01.906 --> 00:01:05.558
to deliver medicine to hospitals
and health centers on demand.

00:01:05.582 --> 00:01:09.753
Last year, we launched the world's first
automated delivery system

00:01:09.777 --> 00:01:11.459
operating at national scale.

00:01:11.928 --> 00:01:13.162
And guess what?

00:01:13.692 --> 00:01:16.067
We did not do that in the US,

00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:18.107
we didn't do it in Japan,

00:01:18.131 --> 00:01:19.636
and we didn't do it in Europe.

00:01:20.035 --> 00:01:23.258
It was actually President Paul Kagame

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:26.074
and the Rwandan Ministry of Health

00:01:26.098 --> 00:01:29.444
that made a big bet
on the potential of this technology

00:01:29.468 --> 00:01:31.148
and signed a commercial contract

00:01:31.172 --> 00:01:35.106
to deliver a majority
of the country's blood on demand.

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:38.354
(Applause)

00:01:41.395 --> 00:01:43.346
Yeah, they deserve the applause.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.556
So why is blood important?

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.463
Rwanda collects between 60- and 80,000
units of blood a year.

00:01:50.487 --> 00:01:52.487
So this is a product
that when you need it,

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:54.124
you really, really need it.

00:01:54.668 --> 00:01:56.819
But blood is also challenging,

00:01:56.843 --> 00:01:59.507
because it has a very short shelf life,

00:01:59.531 --> 00:02:02.177
there are lots of different
storage requirements,

00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:04.561
and it's really hard to predict the demand

00:02:04.585 --> 00:02:06.507
for all of these different blood groups

00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:08.781
before a patient actually needs something.

00:02:09.477 --> 00:02:12.005
But the cool thing is
that using this technology,

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:15.561
Rwanda has been able to keep
more blood centralized

00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:18.296
and then provide it
when a patient needs something

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.554
to any hospital or health center
in an average of just 20 or 30 minutes.

00:02:23.032 --> 00:02:24.839
Do you guys want to see how it works?

00:02:24.863 --> 00:02:26.018
(Audience) Yes.

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:28.961
All right. Nobody believes me,
so ... better to show.

00:02:28.985 --> 00:02:30.509
This is our distribution center,

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:34.316
which is about 20 kilometers
outside of Kigali.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.288
This actually used to be a cornfield
nine months ago,

00:02:37.312 --> 00:02:38.837
and with the Rwandan government,

00:02:38.861 --> 00:02:41.575
we leveled it and built this center
in a couple weeks.

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.955
So when a patient is having an emergency,

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:47.299
a doctor or a nurse at that hospital
can send us a WhatsApp,

00:02:47.323 --> 00:02:48.964
telling us what they need.

00:02:48.988 --> 00:02:51.753
And then our team will immediately
spring into action.

00:02:51.777 --> 00:02:53.455
We pull the blood from our stock,

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.670
which is delivered from the National
Center for Blood Transfusion;

00:02:56.694 --> 00:02:58.532
we scan the blood into our system

00:02:58.556 --> 00:03:01.649
so the Ministry of Health
knows where the blood is going;

00:03:01.673 --> 00:03:03.932
and then we'll basically
pack it into a Zip,

00:03:03.956 --> 00:03:06.676
which is what we call
these little autonomous airplanes

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.011
that run on batteries.

00:03:08.035 --> 00:03:10.050
And then once that Zip is ready to go,

00:03:10.074 --> 00:03:13.281
we accelerate it from zero
to 100 kilometers an hour

00:03:13.305 --> 00:03:14.765
in about half of a second.

00:03:18.711 --> 00:03:19.868
(Audience) Whoa!

00:03:19.892 --> 00:03:22.576
And from the moment it leaves
the end of the launcher,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.976
it's completely autonomous.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.862
(Video: Air traffic controller
directs traffic)

00:03:26.886 --> 00:03:29.265
This is our air traffic
controller calling it in

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:31.131
to Kigali International Airport.

00:03:31.155 --> 00:03:33.108
And when the Zip arrives at the hospital,

00:03:33.132 --> 00:03:35.856
it descends to about 30 feet
and drops the package.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.430
We use a really simple paper parachute --
simple things are best --

00:03:39.454 --> 00:03:42.503
that allows the package to come
to the ground gently and reliably

00:03:42.527 --> 00:03:44.052
in the same place every time.

00:03:44.425 --> 00:03:46.759
So it's just like ride sharing;

00:03:46.783 --> 00:03:50.049
the doctors get a text message
one minute before we arrive, saying,

00:03:50.073 --> 00:03:52.031
"Walk outside and receive your delivery."

00:03:52.055 --> 00:03:53.122
(Laughter)

00:03:53.146 --> 00:03:54.501
And then --

00:03:54.525 --> 00:03:58.939
(Applause)

00:04:01.892 --> 00:04:05.530
and then the doctors have what they need
to save a patient's life.

00:04:05.554 --> 00:04:09.371
This is actually watching a delivery
happen from our distribution center;

00:04:09.395 --> 00:04:12.018
this vehicle is about 50 kilometers away.

00:04:12.042 --> 00:04:16.073
We're able to watch the vehicle
as it makes a delivery at a hospital

00:04:16.097 --> 00:04:17.286
in real time.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.540
You may have noticed there are pings

00:04:19.564 --> 00:04:22.116
that are coming off
of that vehicle on the screen.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.917
Those pings are actually data packets

00:04:23.941 --> 00:04:26.222
that we're getting
over the cell phone networks.

00:04:26.246 --> 00:04:29.432
So these planes have SIM cards
just like your cell phone does,

00:04:29.456 --> 00:04:31.657
and they're communicating
over the cell network

00:04:31.681 --> 00:04:34.560
to tell us where they are
and how they're doing at all times.

00:04:34.584 --> 00:04:37.004
Believe it or not,
we actually buy family plans --

00:04:37.028 --> 00:04:38.038
(Laughter)

00:04:38.062 --> 00:04:39.418
for this fleet of vehicles,

00:04:39.442 --> 00:04:41.489
because that's how we get the best rates.

00:04:41.513 --> 00:04:42.596
(Laughter)

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.036
It's actually not a joke.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.547
(Laughter)

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.000
So today, we're delivering
about 20 percent

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:53.262
of the national blood supply of Rwanda

00:04:53.286 --> 00:04:54.742
outside of Kigali.

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:57.013
We serve about 12 hospitals,

00:04:57.037 --> 00:05:00.549
and we're adding hospitals to that network
at an accelerating rate.

00:05:00.573 --> 00:05:03.575
All of those hospitals only receive
blood in this way,

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:07.830
and most of those hospitals
actually place multiple orders every day.

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:10.485
So the reason --

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.035
in all of health care logistics,

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:15.109
you're always trading off
waste against access.

00:05:15.637 --> 00:05:19.708
So if you want to solve waste,
you keep everything centralized.

00:05:19.732 --> 00:05:22.722
As a result, when patients
are having emergencies,

00:05:22.746 --> 00:05:25.836
sometimes they don't have
the medical product they need.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.339
If you want to solve access, you stock
a lot of medicine at the last mile,

00:05:29.363 --> 00:05:30.884
at hospitals or health centers,

00:05:30.908 --> 00:05:33.072
and then patients have
the medicine they need.

00:05:33.096 --> 00:05:35.268
But you end up throwing
a lot of medicine out,

00:05:35.292 --> 00:05:36.495
which is very expensive.

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:39.464
What's so amazing is that the Rwandan
government has been able

00:05:39.488 --> 00:05:41.959
to break this cycle permanently.

00:05:41.983 --> 00:05:45.431
Because doctors can get
what they need instantly,

00:05:45.455 --> 00:05:48.041
they actually stock
less blood at the hospitals.

00:05:48.818 --> 00:05:52.628
So although use of blood products
has increased substantially

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:54.333
at all the hospitals we serve,

00:05:54.357 --> 00:05:58.418
in the last nine months,
zero units of blood have expired

00:05:58.442 --> 00:06:00.227
at any of these hospitals.

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:04.221
(Applause)

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:08.511
That's an amazing result.

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:11.663
That's actually not been achieved
by any other health care system

00:06:11.687 --> 00:06:12.841
on the planet,

00:06:12.865 --> 00:06:14.455
and it happened here.

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:19.777
But obviously, when we're talking about
delivering medical products instantly,

00:06:19.801 --> 00:06:21.639
the most important thing is patients.

00:06:22.267 --> 00:06:24.526
Let me give you an example.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.174
A couple months ago, a 24-year-old mother
came into one of the hospitals

00:06:28.198 --> 00:06:29.366
that we serve,

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.104
and she gave birth via C-section.

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:34.693
But that led to complications,
and she started to bleed.

00:06:35.366 --> 00:06:39.258
Luckily, the doctors had some blood
of her blood type on hand

00:06:39.282 --> 00:06:42.242
that had been delivered
via Zipline's routine service,

00:06:42.266 --> 00:06:45.293
and so they transfused her
with a couple units of blood.

00:06:45.317 --> 00:06:47.977
But she bled out of those units
in about 10 minutes.

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:53.505
In this case, that mother's life
is in grave danger --

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:55.620
in any hospital in the world.

00:06:56.952 --> 00:06:59.893
But luckily, the doctors
who were taking care of her

00:06:59.917 --> 00:07:02.294
immediately called
our distribution center,

00:07:02.318 --> 00:07:04.408
they placed an emergency order,

00:07:04.432 --> 00:07:08.844
and our team actually did emergency
delivery after emergency delivery

00:07:08.868 --> 00:07:10.566
after emergency delivery.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.134
They ended up sending
seven units of red blood cells,

00:07:13.158 --> 00:07:14.472
four units of plasma

00:07:14.496 --> 00:07:15.821
and two units of platelets.

00:07:15.845 --> 00:07:18.548
That's more blood than you have
in your entire body.

00:07:19.164 --> 00:07:21.218
All of it was transfused into her,

00:07:21.242 --> 00:07:23.401
the doctors were able to stabilize her,

00:07:23.425 --> 00:07:25.658
and she is healthy today.

00:07:26.095 --> 00:07:28.963
(Applause)

00:07:32.645 --> 00:07:37.517
Since we launched, we've done about 400
emergency deliveries like that,

00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:40.804
and there's a story like that one
behind most of those emergencies.

00:07:40.828 --> 00:07:42.667
Here are just a couple of the moms

00:07:42.691 --> 00:07:44.836
who have received transfusions in this way

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.388
in the last couple months.

00:07:47.132 --> 00:07:51.232
We're always reminded: when we can help
a doctor save a mom's life,

00:07:51.256 --> 00:07:53.731
it's not just her life that you're saving.

00:07:53.755 --> 00:07:56.846
That's also a baby boy or a baby girl

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.364
who has a mother while they're growing up.

00:08:00.757 --> 00:08:03.726
(Applause)

00:08:05.507 --> 00:08:06.754
But I want to be clear:

00:08:06.778 --> 00:08:09.360
postpartum hemorrhaging --
it's not a Rwanda problem,

00:08:09.384 --> 00:08:11.231
it's not a developing-world problem --

00:08:11.255 --> 00:08:12.476
this is a global problem.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.561
Maternal health is a challenge everywhere.

00:08:14.585 --> 00:08:17.508
The main difference is that
Rwanda was the first country

00:08:17.532 --> 00:08:20.759
to use radical technology
to do something about it.

00:08:20.783 --> 00:08:25.087
And that's the reason this attitude
of Africa being disrupted

00:08:25.111 --> 00:08:27.024
or advanced technology not working here

00:08:27.048 --> 00:08:28.226
or needing aid

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.635
is so totally wrong.

00:08:29.659 --> 00:08:31.753
Africa can be the disrupter.

00:08:32.423 --> 00:08:37.682
These small, agile, developing economies
can out-innovate large, rich ones.

00:08:37.706 --> 00:08:41.586
And they can totally leapfrog over
the absence of legacy infrastructure

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:43.708
to go straight to newer
and better systems.

00:08:44.237 --> 00:08:45.679
In 2000,

00:08:45.703 --> 00:08:49.519
if you had said that high-quality
cellular networks were about to roll out

00:08:49.543 --> 00:08:50.779
across all of Africa,

00:08:50.803 --> 00:08:53.469
people would have told you
that you were crazy.

00:08:53.493 --> 00:08:56.469
And yet, no one anticipated

00:08:56.493 --> 00:09:00.927
how fast those networks were going
to connect and empower people.

00:09:00.951 --> 00:09:04.877
Today, 44 percent of the GDP of Kenya
flows through M-Pesa,

00:09:04.901 --> 00:09:06.574
their mobile payment platform.

00:09:06.598 --> 00:09:07.906
And not only that,

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.526
but our autonomous fleet of vehicles
relies on that cellular network.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:15.444
Over the next few years as we start
serving private health care facilities,

00:09:15.468 --> 00:09:17.738
we'll also use that mobile
payment platform

00:09:17.762 --> 00:09:19.427
to collect fees for deliveries.

00:09:19.965 --> 00:09:23.750
So innovation leads to more innovation
leads to more innovation.

00:09:23.774 --> 00:09:25.629
And meanwhile,

00:09:25.653 --> 00:09:28.659
most people who live
in developed economies

00:09:28.683 --> 00:09:32.453
think that drone delivery
is technologically impossible,

00:09:32.477 --> 00:09:35.691
let alone happening
at national scale in East Africa.

00:09:36.335 --> 00:09:39.713
And I do mean East Africa,
not just Rwanda.

00:09:40.483 --> 00:09:42.753
On Thursday, just a couple days ago,

00:09:42.777 --> 00:09:45.336
the Tanzanian Ministry of Health announced

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.092
that they are going to use
this same technology

00:09:48.116 --> 00:09:51.704
to provide instant delivery
of a wide range of medical products

00:09:51.728 --> 00:09:55.407
to 10 million of the hardest to reach
people in the country.

00:09:55.789 --> 00:09:59.008
(Applause)

00:10:02.387 --> 00:10:06.601
It's actually going to be the largest
autonomous system anywhere in the world.

00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:08.724
To give you a sense
of what this looks like,

00:10:08.748 --> 00:10:10.946
this is one of the first
distribution centers.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:14.524
You can see a 75-kilometer service radius
around the distribution center,

00:10:14.548 --> 00:10:18.096
and that allows us to serve hundreds
of health facilities and hospitals,

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.386
all of which are rural,

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.303
from that single distribution center.

00:10:21.327 --> 00:10:24.363
But to serve over 20 percent
of the population of Tanzania,

00:10:24.387 --> 00:10:26.846
we're going to need
multiple distribution centers.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.211
We'll actually need four.

00:10:28.235 --> 00:10:30.272
And from these distribution centers,

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:35.534
we expect to be doing several hundred
lifesaving deliveries every day,

00:10:35.558 --> 00:10:39.797
and this system will ultimately serve
over 1,000 health facilities

00:10:39.821 --> 00:10:41.671
and hospitals in the country.

00:10:41.695 --> 00:10:44.790
So yeah, East Africa
is moving really fast.

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:49.963
One thing that people, I think, often miss

00:10:49.987 --> 00:10:53.219
is that these kinds of leaps
generate compounding gains.

00:10:53.243 --> 00:10:57.828
For example, Rwanda, by investing
in this infrastructure for health care,

00:10:57.852 --> 00:11:01.737
now has an aerial logistics network
that they can use

00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:05.144
to catalyze other parts of their economy,

00:11:05.168 --> 00:11:07.230
like agriculture or e-commerce.

00:11:07.254 --> 00:11:08.541
Even more importantly,

00:11:08.565 --> 00:11:13.857
100 percent of the teams we hire
at these distribution centers are local.

00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:15.561
So here's our Rwandan team,

00:11:15.585 --> 00:11:18.965
which is a group of extraordinary
engineers and operators.

00:11:19.489 --> 00:11:24.792
They run the world's only
automated delivery system

00:11:24.816 --> 00:11:26.449
operating at national scale.

00:11:27.099 --> 00:11:29.302
They have been able to master something

00:11:29.326 --> 00:11:32.199
that the largest technology
companies in the world

00:11:32.223 --> 00:11:34.231
have not yet been able to figure out.

00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:36.276
So they are total heroes.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.296
(Applause)

00:11:41.015 --> 00:11:42.482
They're total heroes.

00:11:42.971 --> 00:11:47.385
Our team's mission is to deliver
basic access to medicine

00:11:47.409 --> 00:11:49.498
to all seven billion people on the planet,

00:11:49.522 --> 00:11:51.761
no matter how hard it is to reach them.

00:11:51.785 --> 00:11:53.740
We often tell people about that mission,

00:11:53.764 --> 00:11:56.883
and they say, "That's so generous
of you, it's so philanthropic."

00:11:56.907 --> 00:11:58.269
No!

00:11:58.293 --> 00:12:00.323
Philanthropy has nothing to do with it.

00:12:00.347 --> 00:12:03.961
Because of the commercial contracts
that we sign with ministries of health,

00:12:03.985 --> 00:12:07.552
these networks are 100 percent
sustainable and scalable.

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:11.582
And the reason we feel so strongly
about correcting that misperception

00:12:11.606 --> 00:12:14.661
is that entrepreneurship
is the only force in human history

00:12:14.685 --> 00:12:17.406
that has lifted millions
of people out of poverty.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.195
(Applause)

00:12:21.987 --> 00:12:25.860
No amount of foreign aid
is going to sustainably employ

00:12:25.884 --> 00:12:28.835
250 million African youth.

00:12:30.734 --> 00:12:35.202
And the jobs that these kids
may have gotten 10 years ago

00:12:35.226 --> 00:12:36.664
are largely being automated

00:12:36.688 --> 00:12:39.145
or are being changed
dramatically by technology.

00:12:39.169 --> 00:12:41.331
So they are looking for new skill sets,

00:12:41.355 --> 00:12:42.923
new competitive advantages.

00:12:42.947 --> 00:12:44.494
They're looking for start-ups.

00:12:45.097 --> 00:12:50.793
So why aren't there more start-ups
that are tackling these global problems

00:12:50.817 --> 00:12:53.890
that are faced by billions of people
in developing economies?

00:12:54.933 --> 00:12:57.997
The reason is that investors
and entrepreneurs are totally blind

00:12:58.021 --> 00:12:59.299
to the opportunity.

00:12:59.323 --> 00:13:03.676
We think these problems are the domain
of NGOs or governments,

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.238
not private companies.

00:13:05.262 --> 00:13:07.118
That's what we have to change.

00:13:09.693 --> 00:13:12.480
You may have noticed
I left something out of the video

00:13:12.504 --> 00:13:14.030
that I showed you.

00:13:14.054 --> 00:13:15.899
I didn't show you how the planes land

00:13:15.923 --> 00:13:18.472
when they get back
to the distribution center.

00:13:18.496 --> 00:13:21.176
So, it might be obvious to you:

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.012
none of our planes have landing gear.

00:13:23.036 --> 00:13:25.132
We also don't have runways
where we operate.

00:13:25.156 --> 00:13:27.366
So we have to be able
to decelerate the plane

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.762
from about 100 kilometers an hour
to zero in half of a second.

00:13:30.786 --> 00:13:32.356
And the way we do that

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.128
is we actually use a wire that tracks
that plane as it comes in,

00:13:36.152 --> 00:13:37.965
with centimeter-level accuracy.

00:13:37.989 --> 00:13:40.100
We snag the plane out of the sky,

00:13:40.124 --> 00:13:43.632
and then we gently plop it
onto an actively inflated cushion.

00:13:44.419 --> 00:13:47.070
This is basically a combination
of an aircraft carrier

00:13:47.094 --> 00:13:48.262
and a bouncy castle.

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:49.436
(Laughter)

00:13:50.063 --> 00:13:51.497
So let me show you.

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:00.100
(Laughter)

00:14:00.773 --> 00:14:04.055
(Applause)

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:10.226
And it might be obvious to you
why I wanted to end with this video.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:12.457
I wanted to show you the kids
and the teenagers

00:14:12.481 --> 00:14:14.716
who line up on the fence every day.

00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:18.195
They cheer every launch and every landing.

00:14:18.219 --> 00:14:19.529
(Laughter)

00:14:19.553 --> 00:14:21.971
(Applause)

00:14:24.436 --> 00:14:27.310
Sometimes I actually show up
at the distribution center early

00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:28.498
because I'm jet-lagged.

00:14:28.522 --> 00:14:30.815
I'll show up an hour before
we begin operation.

00:14:30.839 --> 00:14:33.479
And there will be kids on the fence
getting good seats.

00:14:33.503 --> 00:14:34.713
(Laughter)

00:14:34.737 --> 00:14:36.263
And you go up and you ask them,

00:14:36.287 --> 00:14:38.106
"What do you think about the planes?"

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.259
And they'll say, "Oh,
it's a sky ambulance."

00:14:41.757 --> 00:14:42.908
So they get it.

00:14:42.932 --> 00:14:44.963
I mean, they get it more than most adults.

00:14:45.917 --> 00:14:47.185
So I was asking earlier:

00:14:47.209 --> 00:14:52.967
Who is going to be creating the disruptive
technology companies of Africa

00:14:52.991 --> 00:14:54.473
over the next decade?

00:14:54.987 --> 00:14:57.516
Ultimately, it's going
to be up to these kids.

00:14:58.694 --> 00:15:02.587
They are the engineers
of Rwanda and Africa.

00:15:02.997 --> 00:15:05.685
They are the engineers
of our shared future.

00:15:07.326 --> 00:15:11.084
But the only way they can build
that future is if we realize

00:15:11.108 --> 00:15:14.591
that world-changing companies
can scale in Africa,

00:15:14.615 --> 00:15:18.242
and that disruptive technology
can start here first.

00:15:18.822 --> 00:15:19.973
Thanks.

00:15:19.997 --> 00:15:23.886
(Applause)
