00:00:06.891 --> 00:00:08.119
Can you read in the car?

00:00:08.143 --> 00:00:09.969
If so, consider yourself pretty lucky.

00:00:09.993 --> 00:00:11.589
For one-third of the population,

00:00:11.613 --> 00:00:13.720
looking at a book
while moving along in a car

00:00:13.744 --> 00:00:15.043
or a boat or train or plane

00:00:15.067 --> 00:00:17.026
quickly makes them sick to their stomach.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.574
But why do we get motion sickness
in the first place?

00:00:19.598 --> 00:00:22.272
Well, believe it or not,
scientists aren't exactly sure.

00:00:22.296 --> 00:00:23.842
The most common theory has to do

00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:25.447
with mismatched sensory signals.

00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:28.571
When you travel in a car, your body
gets two different messages.

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:30.692
Your eyes are seeing
the inside of a vehicle,

00:00:30.716 --> 00:00:32.241
which doesn't seem to be moving.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.272
Meanwhile, your ear is telling
your brain you're accelerating.

00:00:35.296 --> 00:00:36.435
Wait, your ear?

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:39.571
Your ear has another
important function besides hearing.

00:00:39.595 --> 00:00:43.402
In its innermost part lies a group of
structures known as the vestibular system,

00:00:43.426 --> 00:00:45.713
which gives us our sense
of balance and movement.

00:00:45.737 --> 00:00:47.797
Inside there are
three semicircular tubules

00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:50.543
that can sense rotation,
one for each dimension of space.

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:53.412
And there are also two hair-lined
sacks filled with fluid.

00:00:53.436 --> 00:00:55.976
When you move, the fluid
shifts and tickles the hairs,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.960
telling your brain if you're moving
horizontally or vertically.

00:00:58.984 --> 00:01:01.780
All this tells your body
which direction you're moving in,

00:01:01.804 --> 00:01:04.069
how much you've accelerated,
even at what angle.

00:01:04.093 --> 00:01:05.150
In a car,

00:01:05.175 --> 00:01:07.721
your vestibular system correctly
senses your movement,

00:01:07.745 --> 00:01:10.611
but your eyes don't see it,
especially when glued to a book.

00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:11.782
The opposite can happen.

00:01:11.806 --> 00:01:14.849
You're at the movies, and the camera
makes a sweeping move.

00:01:14.873 --> 00:01:16.860
This time, your eyes think you're moving

00:01:16.884 --> 00:01:18.944
while your ear knows you're sitting still.

00:01:18.968 --> 00:01:22.189
But why does this conflicting information
make us feel so terrible?

00:01:22.213 --> 00:01:23.382
Scientists aren't sure,

00:01:23.406 --> 00:01:25.809
but they think there's
an evolutionary explanation.

00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:27.849
Fast moving vehicles and video recordings

00:01:27.873 --> 00:01:30.264
have only existed
in the last couple of centuries,

00:01:30.288 --> 00:01:31.706
a blink in evolutionary time.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.966
For most of our history,
there wasn't that much

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.784
that could cause this sensory mix-up,

00:01:35.808 --> 00:01:36.879
except for poisons.

00:01:36.903 --> 00:01:40.113
And because poisons
are not the best thing for survival,

00:01:40.137 --> 00:01:43.145
our bodies evolved a direct
but unpleasant way

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.869
to get rid of what we ate
that was causing the confusion.

00:01:45.893 --> 00:01:49.016
It's a pretty reasonable theory,
but it leaves things unexplained,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.912
like why women are more affected
by motion sickness than men,

00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:54.234
or why passengers
get more nauseous than drivers.

00:01:54.258 --> 00:01:56.751
Another theory suggests
that the cause is more about

00:01:56.775 --> 00:01:58.434
the way some unfamiliar situations

00:01:58.458 --> 00:02:00.952
make it harder to maintain
our natural body posture.

00:02:00.976 --> 00:02:04.282
Studies show that being immersed in water
or just changing your stance

00:02:04.306 --> 00:02:06.677
can greatly reduce the effects
of motion sickness.

00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:08.749
But we don't really know what's going on.

00:02:08.773 --> 00:02:11.482
We know the more common remedies
for car queasiness --

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:14.341
looking at the horizon,
over-the-counter pills, chewing gum,

00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:15.832
but none are totally reliable

00:02:15.856 --> 00:02:17.902
nor can they handle
intense motion sickness

00:02:17.926 --> 00:02:20.978
and sometimes the stakes
are far higher than just not being bored

00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:22.102
during a long car ride.

00:02:22.126 --> 00:02:25.666
At NASA, where astronauts are hurled
into space at 17,000 miles per hour,

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.588
motion sickness is a serious problem.

00:02:27.612 --> 00:02:30.595
In addition to researching
the latest space-age technologies,

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:32.060
NASA also spends a lot of time

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:36.353
figuring out how to keep astronauts
from vomiting up their space rations.

00:02:36.377 --> 00:02:39.582
Like understanding the mysteries of sleep
or curing the common cold,

00:02:39.606 --> 00:02:42.634
motion sickness is one of those
seemingly simple problems that,

00:02:42.658 --> 00:02:46.253
despite amazing scientific progress,
we still know very little about.

00:02:46.277 --> 00:02:49.331
Perhaps one day the exact cause
of motion sickness will be found,

00:02:49.355 --> 00:02:51.891
and with it, a completely
effective way to prevent it,

00:02:51.915 --> 00:02:54.017
but that day is still on the horizon.
