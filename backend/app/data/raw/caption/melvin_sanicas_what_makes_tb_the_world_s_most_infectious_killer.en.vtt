00:00:07.818 --> 00:00:14.080
In 2008, archeologists uncovered two 
9,000-year old skeletons.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.731
There’s no definitive way of knowing what 
killed these ancient people,

00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:24.131
but we do know their bones were infected 
by an all too familiar bacterium.

00:00:24.131 --> 00:00:28.352
The ancient Greeks knew its consumptive 
effects as phthisis;

00:00:28.352 --> 00:00:34.451
the Incans called it chaky oncay; 
and the English called it tuberculosis.

00:00:34.451 --> 00:00:37.313
Today, tuberculosis, or TB,

00:00:37.313 --> 00:00:40.344
is still one of the world’s biggest 
infectious killers,

00:00:40.344 --> 00:00:45.104
causing more deaths than malaria or 
even HIV and AIDS.

00:00:45.104 --> 00:00:51.183
But what exactly is this disease, and how 
has this pathogen persisted for so long?

00:00:51.183 --> 00:00:57.201
Typically, TB bacteria called 
mycobacterium tuberculosis, are airborne.

00:00:57.201 --> 00:01:00.618
They travel into our airways and 
infect our lungs.

00:01:00.618 --> 00:01:05.318
Here, immune cells called macrophages 
rush to the infection site,

00:01:05.318 --> 00:01:09.687
attempting to absorb and break down 
the bacterial invaders.

00:01:09.687 --> 00:01:13.593
In many cases, this response is enough 
to remove the bacteria.

00:01:13.593 --> 00:01:16.401
But in individuals with other 
medical conditions–

00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:20.796
ranging from malnutrition and HIV to 
diabetes and pregnancy

00:01:20.796 --> 00:01:25.696
–the immune response may not be 
strong enough to destroy the intruder.

00:01:25.696 --> 00:01:31.908
If so, mycobacterium tuberculosis will 
reproduce inside those macrophages,

00:01:31.908 --> 00:01:35.143
and form colonies in the 
surrounding lung tissue.

00:01:35.143 --> 00:01:36.908
As they infect more cells,

00:01:36.908 --> 00:01:42.318
the bacteria employ cell-degrading enzymes
that destroy the infected tissue,

00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:46.515
triggering chest pain, and causing 
patients to cough up blood.

00:01:46.515 --> 00:01:50.061
The damage to the lungs leads to 
oxygen deprivation.

00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:52.634
This begins a flood of hormonal changes–

00:01:52.634 --> 00:01:56.611
including a decrease in appetite and 
iron production.

00:01:56.611 --> 00:01:59.993
From here, microbes can spread to the 
skeletal system,

00:01:59.993 --> 00:02:02.638
causing back pain and difficulty moving;

00:02:02.638 --> 00:02:05.945
to the kidneys and intestines, 
causing abdominal pain;

00:02:05.945 --> 00:02:10.735
and to the brain, causing headaches 
and even impaired consciousness.

00:02:10.735 --> 00:02:14.348
These symptoms produce the 
classic image of TB:

00:02:14.348 --> 00:02:19.088
weight loss, a hacking, bloody cough, 
and ashen skin.

00:02:19.088 --> 00:02:23.341
This ghostly appearance earned TB 
the title of the ‘White Plague’

00:02:23.341 --> 00:02:25.749
in Victorian-era England.

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:29.785
During this period, tuberculosis was 
considered a ‘romantic disease,'

00:02:29.785 --> 00:02:33.803
because it tended to affect poverty-
stricken artists and poets–

00:02:33.803 --> 00:02:36.393
those with weaker immune systems.

00:02:36.393 --> 00:02:42.771
TB’s outward symptoms even helped 
fuel the popular myth of vampirism.

00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:47.651
In spite of– or perhaps because of 
these less than scientific concerns,

00:02:47.651 --> 00:02:52.682
this period also marked the first strides 
toward curing TB.

00:02:52.682 --> 00:02:56.373
In 1882, the German physician Robert Koch

00:02:56.373 --> 00:02:59.451
identified the disease’s 
bacterial origins.

00:02:59.451 --> 00:03:04.361
13 years later, physicist Wilhelm 
Roentgen  discovered the X-ray,

00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:09.659
enabling physicians to diagnose and track 
its progression through the body.

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.453
These techniques allowed researchers to 
develop reliable and effective vaccines–

00:03:14.453 --> 00:03:18.035
first for smallpox, and again in 1921,

00:03:18.035 --> 00:03:23.375
when scientists developed the BCG 
vaccine to battle TB.

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:27.906
These developments laid the groundwork 
for the modern field of antibiotics–

00:03:27.906 --> 00:03:31.025
currently home to our most effective 
TB treatments.

00:03:31.025 --> 00:03:36.095
But, antibiotics fail to address a major 
diagnostic complication:

00:03:36.095 --> 00:03:41.866
about 90% of people infected with TB 
don’t show any symptoms.

00:03:41.866 --> 00:03:46.576
In these latent infections, the TB 
bacterium may be dormant,

00:03:46.576 --> 00:03:51.851
only activating when someone’s immune 
system is too weak to mount a defense.

00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:54.774
This makes TB much harder to diagnose.

00:03:54.774 --> 00:03:56.984
And even when properly identified,

00:03:56.984 --> 00:04:00.318
traditional treatments can take 
up to 9 months,

00:04:00.318 --> 00:04:04.775
requiring multiple drugs and a high 
potential for side effects.

00:04:04.775 --> 00:04:07.904
This discourages people from finishing 
the full course,

00:04:07.904 --> 00:04:13.244
and partial treatment enables bacteria to 
develop resistance to these drugs.

00:04:13.244 --> 00:04:17.310
Today, the disease is still prevalent 
in 30 countries,

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.737
most of which face other health crises

00:04:19.737 --> 00:04:24.078
that exacerbate TB and 
trigger latent cases.

00:04:24.078 --> 00:04:28.633
Worse still, accessing treatment can 
be difficult in many of these countries,

00:04:28.633 --> 00:04:33.443
and the stigma towards TB can discourage 
people from getting the help they need.

00:04:33.443 --> 00:04:37.136
Health experts agree we need to 
develop better diagnostics,

00:04:37.136 --> 00:04:41.606
faster acting antibiotics, and more 
effective vaccines.

00:04:41.606 --> 00:04:46.628
Researchers have already developed a urine
test that yields results in 12 hours,

00:04:46.628 --> 00:04:52.838
as well as a new oral treatment that could
cut treatment time by 75%.

00:04:52.838 --> 00:04:54.988
Hopefully, with advancements like these,

00:04:54.988 --> 00:04:59.848
we’ll finally be able to make TB 
exclusively a thing of the past.
