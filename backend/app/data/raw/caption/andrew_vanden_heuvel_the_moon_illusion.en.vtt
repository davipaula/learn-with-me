00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.172
Have you ever noticed

00:00:11.172 --> 00:00:12.570
how the full moon looks bigger

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.042
when it's near the horizon

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:15.976
than when it's high over head?

00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:17.530
If so, you're not alone.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.730
People have wondered about this strange effect

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.105
since ancient times,

00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:23.600
and surprisingly, we still don't have

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.315
a great explanation,

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:26.358
but that's not for lack of trying.

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:28.626
Some of the greatest minds in history -

00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:29.395
Aristotle,

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:30.084
Ptolemy,

00:00:30.084 --> 00:00:30.816
Da Vinci,

00:00:30.816 --> 00:00:31.560
Decartes

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.286
- have all wrestled with this problem

00:00:33.286 --> 00:00:36.645
and failed to generate an adequate explanation.

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:38.317
One of the first ideas suggested

00:00:38.317 --> 00:00:40.426
was that the image of the moon in the sky

00:00:40.426 --> 00:00:42.797
really is bigger near the horizon.

00:00:42.797 --> 00:00:45.728
Perhaps the Earth's atmosphere acts like a giant lens,

00:00:45.728 --> 00:00:48.343
magnifying the moon as it rises and sets.

00:00:48.343 --> 00:00:50.680
But this explanation doesn't cut it.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.816
If anything, the refraction of the atmosphere

00:00:52.816 --> 00:00:55.100
would make the moon look slightly smaller.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.561
Plus, if you actually measure

00:00:56.561 --> 00:00:57.926
the size of the visible moon

00:00:57.926 --> 00:00:59.940
at different positions,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.594
it doesn't change at all.

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:02.438
But then, why does it still seem bigger

00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:03.822
when it's rising?

00:01:03.822 --> 00:01:06.141
This must be some kind of optical illusion.

00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:08.207
The question is, which one?

00:01:08.207 --> 00:01:11.113
One explanation is the Ebbinghaus Illusion,

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:13.327
where two identical objects look different

00:01:13.327 --> 00:01:14.796
because of the relative size

00:01:14.796 --> 00:01:17.100
of the objects they're surrounded by.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.295
Here the two center circles are actually the same size.

00:01:21.295 --> 00:01:23.323
Maybe the moon looks bigger near the horizon

00:01:23.323 --> 00:01:25.206
because it's next to tiny trees,

00:01:25.206 --> 00:01:25.843
houses,

00:01:25.843 --> 00:01:27.680
and towers in the distance.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.143
But when the moon is higher up,

00:01:29.143 --> 00:01:31.648
it's surrounded by the vast darkness of the night sky

00:01:31.648 --> 00:01:34.128
and looks tiny by comparison.

00:01:34.128 --> 00:01:37.096
Another possibility is the famous Ponzo Illusion.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:39.515
If you've ever tried to draw in perspective,

00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:41.864
you know that the closer something is to the horizon,

00:01:41.864 --> 00:01:43.818
the smaller you should draw it.

00:01:43.818 --> 00:01:46.593
Our brain compensates automatically for this

00:01:46.593 --> 00:01:48.706
by perceiving objects near the horizon

00:01:48.706 --> 00:01:50.876
as larger than they actually appear.

00:01:50.876 --> 00:01:52.787
The two yellow lines in this drawing

00:01:52.787 --> 00:01:53.904
are the same size,

00:01:53.904 --> 00:01:55.572
but the upper one seems bigger

00:01:55.572 --> 00:01:57.412
because we interpret it as receding

00:01:57.412 --> 00:01:59.042
farther into the horizon.

00:01:59.042 --> 00:02:01.379
So, between Ponzo and Ebbinghaus,

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:02.911
it seems like we've solved the mystery

00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:03.995
of the moon illusion,

00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:06.375
but, unfortunately, there are a few details

00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:08.354
that complicate things.

00:02:08.385 --> 00:02:11.352
For one thing, if this was just the Ebbinghaus effect,

00:02:11.352 --> 00:02:12.884
then we would expect the moon illusion

00:02:12.884 --> 00:02:16.112
to disappear for pilots flying high above the clouds

00:02:16.112 --> 00:02:18.066
since there wouldn't be any other smaller objects

00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:19.599
near the horizon.

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.603
But in fact, pilots and sailors out on the ocean

00:02:22.603 --> 00:02:24.825
still claim to see the moon illusion.

00:02:24.825 --> 00:02:27.525
On the other hand, if it's just our brain's autocorrecting

00:02:27.525 --> 00:02:29.663
the size of objects near the horizon,

00:02:29.663 --> 00:02:31.196
then we'd expect the moon illusion

00:02:31.196 --> 00:02:33.488
to be visible inside a planetarium,

00:02:33.488 --> 00:02:34.449
where the whole sky,

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:35.619
including the horizon,

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:38.789
is displayed on a spherical dome overhead.

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:40.430
Studies have shown, though,

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.141
that this is not the case.

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:43.257
To make matters worse,

00:02:43.257 --> 00:02:45.929
it seems the moon illusion disappears entirely

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:47.011
if you just bend over

00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:49.071
and look at the moon between your legs.

00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:51.379
Now, this is just getting ridiculous!

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.551
One of the most promising explanations today

00:02:54.551 --> 00:02:57.384
is known as Convergence Micropsia.

00:02:57.384 --> 00:02:59.568
Our brains judge the distance to objects

00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:01.108
and their apparent size

00:03:01.108 --> 00:03:03.064
by the focus of our eyes.

00:03:03.064 --> 00:03:04.528
When looking at the horizon,

00:03:04.528 --> 00:03:06.861
your eyes focus far off into the distance

00:03:06.861 --> 00:03:09.200
so your brain knows you're looking far away.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.178
The moon appears a certain size.

00:03:11.178 --> 00:03:12.860
Your brain thinks it's far away,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.705
which it is,

00:03:13.705 --> 00:03:16.585
so you naturally conclude the moon must be big.

00:03:16.585 --> 00:03:18.619
But when looking up at the night sky,

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:20.505
there's nothing for your eyes to focus on,

00:03:20.505 --> 00:03:22.344
so they default to their rest focus,

00:03:22.344 --> 00:03:25.261
which is a point just a few meters away.

00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:27.185
Now your brain thinks the moon is much closer

00:03:27.185 --> 00:03:28.343
than it really is,

00:03:28.343 --> 00:03:29.430
so you naturally conclude

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.169
the moon's not as big as you thought it was.

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:33.811
Rather than explain why the moon

00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:35.639
looks so big near the horizon,

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.432
Convergence Microspia explains

00:03:37.432 --> 00:03:40.312
why the moon looks so small when overhead.

00:03:40.312 --> 00:03:42.125
Still not satisfied?

00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:44.851
Well, frankly, neither are many scientists,

00:03:44.851 --> 00:03:47.841
so the debate over the moon illusion still rages on

00:03:47.841 --> 00:03:50.346
and may continue as long as we still see it

00:03:50.346 --> 00:03:51.440
in the night sky.
