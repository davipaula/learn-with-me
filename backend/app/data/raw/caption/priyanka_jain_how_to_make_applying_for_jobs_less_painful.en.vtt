00:00:00.141 --> 00:00:01.557
Applying for jobs online

00:00:01.581 --> 00:00:04.197
is one of the worst
digital experiences of our time.

00:00:04.221 --> 00:00:06.917
And applying for jobs in person
really isn't much better.

00:00:06.942 --> 00:00:08.662
[The Way We Work]

00:00:11.181 --> 00:00:13.637
Hiring as we know it
is broken on many fronts.

00:00:13.661 --> 00:00:15.517
It's a terrible experience for people.

00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:17.357
About 75 percent of people

00:00:17.381 --> 00:00:20.237
who applied to jobs
using various methods in the past year

00:00:20.261 --> 00:00:22.917
said they never heard anything back
from the employer.

00:00:22.941 --> 00:00:25.117
And at the company level
it's not much better.

00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:27.917
46 percent of people get fired or quit

00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:30.117
within the first year
of starting their jobs.

00:00:30.141 --> 00:00:31.357
It's pretty mind-blowing.

00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:32.837
It's also bad for the economy.

00:00:32.861 --> 00:00:34.317
For the first time in history,

00:00:34.341 --> 00:00:37.197
we have more open jobs
than we have unemployed people,

00:00:37.221 --> 00:00:39.397
and to me that screams
that we have a problem.

00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:43.397
I believe that at the crux of all of this
is a single piece of paper: the résumé.

00:00:43.421 --> 00:00:45.757
A résumé definitely has
some useful pieces in it:

00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:47.877
what roles people have had,
computer skills,

00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:49.157
what languages they speak,

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:52.237
but what it misses is
what they have the potential to do

00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:55.237
that they might not have had
the opportunity to do in the past.

00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:58.517
And with such a quickly changing economy
where jobs are coming online

00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:00.597
that might require skills that nobody has,

00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:03.397
if we only look at what someone
has done in the past,

00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:06.677
we're not going to be able
to match people to the jobs of the future.

00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:09.437
So this is where I think technology
can be really helpful.

00:01:09.461 --> 00:01:12.317
You've probably seen
that algorithms have gotten pretty good

00:01:12.341 --> 00:01:13.877
at matching people to things,

00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:16.157
but what if we could use
that same technology

00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:19.277
to actually help us find jobs
that we're really well-suited for?

00:01:19.301 --> 00:01:20.877
But I know what you're thinking.

00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:23.677
Algorithms picking your next job
sounds a little bit scary,

00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:25.757
but there is one thing that has been shown

00:01:25.781 --> 00:01:28.677
to be really predictive
of someone's future success in a job,

00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:30.837
and that's what's called
a multimeasure test.

00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:33.037
Multimeasure tests
really aren't anything new,

00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:34.797
but they used to be really expensive

00:01:34.821 --> 00:01:36.837
and required a PhD sitting across from you

00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:39.317
and answering lots of questions
and writing reports.

00:01:39.341 --> 00:01:41.037
Multimeasure tests are a way

00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:43.517
to understand someone's inherent traits --

00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:45.317
your memory, your attentiveness.

00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:48.197
What if we could take multimeasure tests

00:01:48.221 --> 00:01:50.757
and make them scalable and accessible,

00:01:50.781 --> 00:01:54.157
and provide data to employers
about really what the traits are

00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:57.077
of someone who can make
them a good fit for a job?

00:01:57.101 --> 00:01:58.397
This all sounds abstract.

00:01:58.421 --> 00:02:00.156
Let's try one of the games together.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.037
You're about to see a flashing circle,

00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:05.021
and your job is going to be
to clap when the circle is red

00:02:05.878 --> 00:02:07.374
and do nothing when it's green.

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:08.775
[Ready?]

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.160
[Begin!]

00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:12.301
[Green circle]

00:02:13.301 --> 00:02:14.341
[Green circle]

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:16.301
[Red circle]

00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:18.381
[Green circle]

00:02:19.301 --> 00:02:20.301
[Red circle]

00:02:21.521 --> 00:02:23.117
Maybe you're the type of person

00:02:23.141 --> 00:02:25.637
who claps the millisecond
after a red circle appears.

00:02:25.661 --> 00:02:27.317
Or maybe you're the type of person

00:02:27.341 --> 00:02:30.076
who takes just a little bit longer
to be 100 percent sure.

00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:33.037
Or maybe you clap on green
even though you're not supposed to.

00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:36.037
The cool thing here is that
this isn't like a standardized test

00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:38.717
where some people are employable
and some people aren't.

00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:41.997
Instead it's about understanding
the fit between your characteristics

00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:44.037
and what would make you
good a certain job.

00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:47.797
We found that if you clap late on red
and you never clap on the green,

00:02:47.821 --> 00:02:50.997
you might be high in attentiveness
and high in restraint.

00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:54.597
People in that quadrant tend to be
great students, great test-takers,

00:02:54.621 --> 00:02:56.757
great at project management or accounting.

00:02:56.781 --> 00:03:00.117
But if you clap immediately on red
and sometimes clap on green,

00:03:00.141 --> 00:03:02.797
that might mean that
you're more impulsive and creative,

00:03:02.821 --> 00:03:06.696
and we've found that top-performing
salespeople often embody these traits.

00:03:06.721 --> 00:03:08.737
The way we actually use this in hiring

00:03:08.761 --> 00:03:12.457
is we have top performers in a role
go through neuroscience exercises

00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:13.697
like this one.

00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:15.097
Then we develop an algorithm

00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:17.777
that understands what makes
those top performers unique.

00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:19.737
And then when people apply to the job,

00:03:19.761 --> 00:03:23.897
we're able to surface the candidates
who might be best suited for that job.

00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:26.297
So you might be thinking
there's a danger in this.

00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:28.457
The work world today
is not the most diverse

00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:31.577
and if we're building algorithms
based on current top performers,

00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:32.817
how do we make sure

00:03:32.841 --> 00:03:35.817
that we're not just perpetuating
the biases that already exist?

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:39.897
For example, if we were building
an algorithm based on top performing CEOs

00:03:39.921 --> 00:03:43.137
and use the S&amp;P 500 as a training set,

00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:44.417
you would actually find

00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:48.257
that you're more likely to hire
a white man named John than any woman.

00:03:48.281 --> 00:03:50.977
And that's the reality
of who's in those roles right now.

00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:54.377
But technology actually poses
a really interesting opportunity.

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.657
We can create algorithms
that are more equitable

00:03:56.681 --> 00:03:58.937
and more fair than human beings
have ever been.

00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:02.657
Every algorithm that we put
into production has been pretested

00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:05.777
to ensure that it doesn't favor
any gender or ethnicity.

00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:08.537
And if there's any population
that's being overfavored,

00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:11.681
we can actually alter the algorithm
until that's no longer true.

00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:14.257
When we focus on the inherent
characteristics

00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:16.377
that can make somebody
a good fit for a job,

00:04:16.401 --> 00:04:19.977
we can transcend racism,
classism, sexism, ageism --

00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:21.417
even good schoolism.

00:04:21.441 --> 00:04:24.337
Our best technology and algorithms
shouldn't just be used

00:04:24.361 --> 00:04:28.097
for helping us find our next movie binge
or new favorite Justin Bieber song.

00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:30.777
Imagine if we could harness
the power of technology

00:04:30.801 --> 00:04:33.097
to get real guidance
on what we should be doing

00:04:33.121 --> 00:04:35.057
based on who we are at a deeper level.
