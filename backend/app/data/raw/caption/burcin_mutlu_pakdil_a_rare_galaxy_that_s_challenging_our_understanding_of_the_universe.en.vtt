00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.149
There are more than a trillion
galaxies in the universe.

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:21.238
And my team discovered
an extremely rare one,

00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:26.375
a galaxy that doesn't look
quite like anything observed before.

00:00:27.077 --> 00:00:29.712
This galaxy is so peculiar,

00:00:29.736 --> 00:00:33.410
that it challenges our theories
and our assumptions

00:00:33.434 --> 00:00:35.632
about how the universe works.

00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:40.473
The majority of the galaxies are spiral,

00:00:40.497 --> 00:00:42.430
similar to our own Milky Way.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.132
We have strong theories about how
these common galaxies form and evolve.

00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:54.708
But we don't understand
how rare galaxies form and evolve.

00:00:55.965 --> 00:00:59.432
An especially puzzling rare case
is Hoag's Object.

00:01:00.434 --> 00:01:07.006
It has a very symmetric central body
surrounded by a circular outer ring,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.926
with nothing visible connecting them.

00:01:10.974 --> 00:01:16.058
Hoag-type galaxies are among the rarest
types of galaxies currently known.

00:01:16.538 --> 00:01:20.418
There are fewer than one
in 1,000 galaxies.

00:01:22.072 --> 00:01:28.001
It's a mystery how the stars
in the outer ring are just floating there

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:30.152
in such an orderly manner.

00:01:30.898 --> 00:01:32.631
That's interesting, right?

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.255
Hold on.

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:36.946
Things are about to get more mysterious.

00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:41.042
The galaxy that my team
discovered is even rarer

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:43.170
and much more complex than that.

00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:48.220
You know, sometimes, you search
and search for these objects,

00:01:48.244 --> 00:01:49.783
and you find nothing.

00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:54.227
But sometimes, it just appears
in the background,

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:57.585
when you are not even looking for it.

00:01:58.395 --> 00:02:01.696
This system looks very similar
to Hoag's Object,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.164
with its central body
and circular outer ring.

00:02:05.188 --> 00:02:09.743
We got very excited and thought
we discovered another Hoag's Object.

00:02:10.427 --> 00:02:16.865
But my research showed
this is an entirely new galaxy type,

00:02:17.417 --> 00:02:20.859
now commonly referred to
as "Burçin's Galaxy."

00:02:21.957 --> 00:02:23.108
(Laughs)

00:02:23.132 --> 00:02:26.657
(Cheers) (Applause)

00:02:27.072 --> 00:02:31.213
We will not be visiting
this galaxy anytime soon.

00:02:31.237 --> 00:02:37.677
It is approximately 359 million
light years away from Earth.

00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:40.065
You may think this is far.

00:02:40.545 --> 00:02:44.011
Well, actually, this is one
of the nearby galaxies.

00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:48.069
I study this object in different light --

00:02:48.796 --> 00:02:52.290
in ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared.

00:02:53.448 --> 00:02:57.678
Small details on our body,
like a scar or wrinkles,

00:02:57.702 --> 00:02:59.321
tell the story of our lives.

00:02:59.773 --> 00:03:03.869
Similarly, a galaxy's structure
in different light

00:03:03.893 --> 00:03:07.424
can help us trace back
their origin and evolution.

00:03:07.927 --> 00:03:09.894
How do I look for these details?

00:03:10.592 --> 00:03:13.141
I model the bright central body

00:03:13.165 --> 00:03:15.649
and remove my model from the image

00:03:15.673 --> 00:03:18.022
to check for any hidden features,

00:03:18.046 --> 00:03:24.022
because a bright structure in a galaxy
may blind our views of faint features,

00:03:24.046 --> 00:03:28.814
just like using sunglasses
when you are blinded by the intense light.

00:03:30.297 --> 00:03:32.751
The result was a big surprise.

00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:37.042
This galaxy doesn't just
have an outer ring,

00:03:37.066 --> 00:03:40.788
it has an additional, diffused inner ring.

00:03:41.616 --> 00:03:46.354
We were having a hard time
explaining the origin of the outer ring

00:03:46.378 --> 00:03:47.915
in Hoag-type galaxies.

00:03:48.314 --> 00:03:52.266
Now we also need to explain
this mysterious second ring.

00:03:53.611 --> 00:03:56.246
There is currently no known mechanism

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.993
that can explain the existence of an inner
ring in such a peculiar galaxy.

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.093
So the discovery of Burçin's Galaxy
clearly highlights the gap

00:04:06.117 --> 00:04:08.646
in our knowledge of galaxy evolution.

00:04:09.601 --> 00:04:14.339
Further research into how
this extremely rare galaxy was formed

00:04:14.363 --> 00:04:18.966
can provide us with new clues
on how the universe works.

00:04:21.257 --> 00:04:25.915
This discovery tells us
that we still have a lot to learn,

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:29.849
and we should keep looking
deeper and deeper in space

00:04:29.873 --> 00:04:32.206
and keep searching for the unknown.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.120
Thank you.

00:04:34.144 --> 00:04:38.109
(Applause)
