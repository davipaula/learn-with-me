00:00:07.313 --> 00:00:09.327
When you hear the word symmetry,

00:00:09.327 --> 00:00:11.627
maybe you picture a simple geometric shape

00:00:11.627 --> 00:00:13.138
like a square or a triangle,

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:16.148
or the complex pattern on a butterfly's wings.

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:17.731
If you are artistically inclined,

00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:20.516
you might think of the subtle modulations of a Mozart concerto,

00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:23.836
or the effortless poise of a prima ballerina.

00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:25.093
When used in every day life,

00:00:25.093 --> 00:00:27.450
the word symmetry represents vague notions of

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.860
beauty, harmony and balance.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.004
In math and science, symmetry has a different,

00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:35.165
and very specific, meaning.

00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:36.294
In this technical sense,

00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:39.397
a symmetry is the property of an object.

00:00:39.397 --> 00:00:42.058
Pretty much any type of object can have symmetry,

00:00:42.058 --> 00:00:44.234
from tangible things like butterflies,

00:00:44.234 --> 00:00:46.994
to abstract entities like geometric shapes.

00:00:46.994 --> 00:00:50.390
So, what does it mean for an object to be symmetric?

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.794
Here's the definition:

00:00:51.794 --> 00:00:56.842
a symmetry is a transformation that leaves that object unchanged.

00:00:56.842 --> 00:01:00.261
Okay, that sounds a bit abstract, so let's unpack it.

00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:02.344
It will help to look at a particular example,

00:01:02.344 --> 00:01:04.827
like this equilateral triangle.

00:01:04.827 --> 00:01:07.874
If we rotate our triangle through 120 degrees,

00:01:07.874 --> 00:01:09.723
around an access through its center,

00:01:09.723 --> 00:01:12.808
we end up with a triangle that's identical to the original.

00:01:12.808 --> 00:01:15.354
In this case, the object is the triangle,

00:01:15.354 --> 00:01:17.797
and the transformation that leaves the object unchanged

00:01:17.797 --> 00:01:20.513
is rotation through 120 degrees.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:23.633
So we can say an equilateral triangle is symmetric

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:28.254
with respect to rotations of 120 degrees around its center.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:32.208
If we rotated the triangle by, say, 90 degrees instead,

00:01:32.208 --> 00:01:35.157
the rotated triangle would look different to the original.

00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:38.324
In other words, an equilateral triangle is not symmetric

00:01:38.324 --> 00:01:41.993
with respect to rotations of 90 degrees around its center.

00:01:41.993 --> 00:01:45.639
But why do mathematicians and scientists care about symmetries?

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:48.924
Turns out, they're essential in many fields of math and science.

00:01:48.924 --> 00:01:52.350
Let's take a close look at one example: symmetry in biology.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.622
You might have noticed that there's a very familiar kind of symmetry

00:01:55.622 --> 00:01:56.908
we haven't mentioned yet:

00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:59.573
the symmetry of the right and left sides of the human body.

00:01:59.573 --> 00:02:02.545
The transformation that gives this symmetry is reflection

00:02:02.545 --> 00:02:06.235
by an imaginary mirror that slices vertically through the body.

00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:09.991
Biologists call this bilateral symmetry.

00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:11.996
As with all symmetries found in living things,

00:02:11.996 --> 00:02:13.157
it's only approximate,

00:02:13.157 --> 00:02:16.639
but still a striking feature of the human body.

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:20.121
We humans aren't the only bilaterally symmetric organisms.

00:02:20.121 --> 00:02:22.784
Many other animals, foxes, sharks, beetles,

00:02:22.784 --> 00:02:24.830
that butterfly we mentioned earlier,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.286
have this kind of symmetry,

00:02:26.286 --> 00:02:29.190
as do some plants like orchid flowers.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.239
Other organisms have different symmetries,

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.395
ones that only become apparent

00:02:32.395 --> 00:02:35.601
when you rotate the organism around its center point.

00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:38.833
It's a lot like the rotational symmetry of the triangle we watched earlier.

00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:40.136
But when it occurs in animals,

00:02:40.136 --> 00:02:43.397
this kind of symmetry is known as radial symmetry.

00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:45.889
For instance, some sea urchins and starfish

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.417
have pentaradial or five-fold symmetry,

00:02:48.417 --> 00:02:53.110
that is, symmetry with respect to rotations of 72 degrees around their center.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.194
This symmetry also appears in plants,

00:02:55.194 --> 00:02:58.954
as you can see for yourself by slicing through an apple horizontally.

00:02:58.954 --> 00:03:02.069
Some jellyfish are symmetric with respect to rotations of 90 degrees,

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.767
while sea anemones are symmetric when you rotate them at any angle.

00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:08.406
Some corals, on the other hand, have no symmetry at all.

00:03:08.406 --> 00:03:10.568
They are completely asymmetric.

00:03:10.568 --> 00:03:13.796
But why do organisms exhibit these different symmetries?

00:03:13.796 --> 00:03:17.284
Does body symmetry tell us anything about an animal's lifestyle?

00:03:17.284 --> 00:03:18.882
Let's look at one particular group:

00:03:18.882 --> 00:03:20.729
bilaterally symmetric animals.

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:24.354
In this camp, we have foxes, beetles, sharks, butterflies,

00:03:24.354 --> 00:03:26.706
and, of course, humans.

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:29.473
The thing that unites bilaterally symmetric animals

00:03:29.473 --> 00:03:32.489
is that their bodies are designed around movement.

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.613
If you want to pick one direction and move that way,

00:03:34.613 --> 00:03:36.368
it helps to have a front end

00:03:36.368 --> 00:03:38.155
where you can group your sensory organs--

00:03:38.155 --> 00:03:40.449
your eyes, ears and nose.

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.272
It helps to have your mouth there too

00:03:42.272 --> 00:03:44.187
since you're more likely to run into food

00:03:44.187 --> 00:03:46.217
or enemies from this end.

00:03:46.217 --> 00:03:48.720
You're probably familiar with a name for a group of organs,

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.699
plus a mouth, mounted on the front of an animal's body.

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.526
It's called a head.

00:03:53.526 --> 00:03:57.257
Having a head leads naturally to the development of bilateral symmetry.

00:03:57.257 --> 00:04:00.378
And it also helps you build streamlined fins if you're a fish,

00:04:00.378 --> 00:04:02.313
aerodynamic wings if you're a bird,

00:04:02.313 --> 00:04:05.953
or well coordinated legs for running if you're a fox.

00:04:05.953 --> 00:04:08.730
But, what does this all have to do with evolution?

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.514
Turns out, biologists can use these various body symmetries

00:04:11.514 --> 00:04:14.193
to figure out which animals are related to which.

00:04:14.193 --> 00:04:18.037
For instance, we saw that starfish and sea urchins have five-fold symmetry.

00:04:18.037 --> 00:04:20.157
But really what we should have said was

00:04:20.157 --> 00:04:21.880
adult starfish and sea urchins.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.772
In their larval stage, they're bilateral, just like us humans.

00:04:25.772 --> 00:04:27.817
For biologists, this is strong evidence

00:04:27.817 --> 00:04:29.836
that we're more closely related to starfish

00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:31.620
than we are, to say, corals,

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.876
or other animals that don't exhibit bilateral symmetry

00:04:33.876 --> 00:04:35.938
at any stage in their development.

00:04:35.938 --> 00:04:38.782
One of the most fascinating and important problems in biology

00:04:38.782 --> 00:04:40.793
is reconstructing the tree of life,

00:04:40.793 --> 00:04:44.210
discovering when and how the different branches diverged.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.529
Thinking about something as simple as body symmetry

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:49.128
can help us dig far into our evolutionary past

00:04:49.128 --> 00:04:52.531
and understand where we, as a species, have come from.
