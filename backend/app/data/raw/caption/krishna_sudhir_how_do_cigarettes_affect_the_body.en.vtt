00:00:06.898 --> 00:00:09.219
Cigarettes aren’t good for us.

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.865
That’s hardly news--we’ve known 
about the dangers of smoking for decades.

00:00:13.865 --> 00:00:16.860
But how exactly do cigarettes harm us?

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.192
Let’s look at what happens 
as their ingredients

00:00:19.192 --> 00:00:20.851
make their way through our bodies,

00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:25.478
and how we benefit physically 
when we finally give up smoking.

00:00:25.478 --> 00:00:27.358
With each inhalation,

00:00:27.358 --> 00:00:31.158
smoke brings its more than 5,000 
chemical substances

00:00:31.158 --> 00:00:33.766
into contact with the body’s tissues.

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:37.444
From the start, tar, 
a black, resinous material,

00:00:37.444 --> 00:00:39.825
begins to coat the teeth and gums,

00:00:39.825 --> 00:00:43.708
damaging tooth enamel, 
and eventually causing decay.

00:00:43.708 --> 00:00:47.721
Over time, smoke also damages 
nerve-endings in the nose,

00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:50.006
causing loss of smell.

00:00:50.006 --> 00:00:51.815
Inside the airways and lungs,

00:00:51.815 --> 00:00:54.604
smoke increases 
the likelihood of infections,

00:00:54.604 --> 00:00:59.277
as well as chronic diseases
like&nbsp;bronchitis and&nbsp;emphysema.

00:00:59.277 --> 00:01:01.707
It does this by damaging the&nbsp;cilia,

00:01:01.707 --> 00:01:07.067
tiny hairlike structures whose job it is 
to keep the airways clean.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.504
It then fills the alveoli,

00:01:09.504 --> 00:01:13.654
tiny air sacs that enable the exchange 
of oxygen and carbon dioxide

00:01:13.654 --> 00:01:15.258
between the lungs and blood.

00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:20.251
A toxic gas called carbon monoxide 
crosses that membrane into the blood,

00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:21.958
binding to hemoglobin

00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:23.561
and displacing the oxygen

00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:26.771
it would usually have transported
around the body.

00:01:26.771 --> 00:01:30.380
That’s one of the reasons smoking 
can lead to oxygen deprivation

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.954
and shortness of breath.

00:01:32.954 --> 00:01:35.121
Within about 10 seconds,

00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:38.897
the bloodstream carries a stimulant 
called nicotine to the brain,

00:01:38.897 --> 00:01:42.413
triggering the release of dopamine 
and other neurotransmitters

00:01:42.413 --> 00:01:43.689
including endorphins

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.684
that create the pleasurable sensations 
which make smoking highly addictive.

00:01:47.684 --> 00:01:50.043
Nicotine and other chemicals 
from the cigarette

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:53.006
simultaneously cause constriction 
of blood vessels

00:01:53.006 --> 00:01:55.942
and damage their delicate 
endothelial lining,

00:01:55.942 --> 00:01:57.675
restricting blood flow.

00:01:57.675 --> 00:02:00.957
These vascular effects lead 
to thickening of blood vessel walls

00:02:00.957 --> 00:02:03.471
and enhance blood platelet stickiness,

00:02:03.471 --> 00:02:06.055
increasing the likelihood 
that clots will form

00:02:06.055 --> 00:02:08.929
and trigger heart attacks and strokes.

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.689
Many of the chemicals inside cigarettes 
can trigger dangerous mutations

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.965
in the body’s DNA that make cancers form.

00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:18.955
Additionally, ingredients like arsenic 
and nickel

00:02:18.955 --> 00:02:21.524
may disrupt the process of DNA repair,

00:02:21.524 --> 00:02:25.443
thus compromising the body’s ability 
to fight many cancers.

00:02:25.443 --> 00:02:29.175
In fact, about one of every three 
cancer deaths in the United States

00:02:29.175 --> 00:02:31.218
is caused by smoking.

00:02:31.218 --> 00:02:33.571
And it’s not just lung cancer.

00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:36.938
Smoking can cause cancer 
in multiple tissues and organs,

00:02:36.938 --> 00:02:38.745
as well as damaged eyesight

00:02:38.745 --> 00:02:40.901
and weakened bones.

00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:43.110
It makes it harder 
for women to get pregnant.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.088
And in men,
it can cause erectile dysfunction.

00:02:46.088 --> 00:02:47.785
But for those who quit smoking,

00:02:47.785 --> 00:02:49.763
there’s a huge positive upside

00:02:49.763 --> 00:02:53.328
with almost immediate 
and long-lasting physical benefits.

00:02:53.328 --> 00:02:57.010
Just 20 minutes after 
a smoker’s final cigarette,

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.841
their heart rate and blood pressure
begin to return to normal.

00:03:00.841 --> 00:03:04.259
After 12 hours, 
carbon monoxide levels stabilize,

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:07.023
increasing the blood’s 
oxygen-carrying capacity.

00:03:07.023 --> 00:03:08.540
A day after ceasing,

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.894
heart attack risk begins to decrease as
blood pressure and heart rates normalize.

00:03:13.894 --> 00:03:15.170
After two days,

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.094
the nerve endings responsible 
for smell and taste start to recover.

00:03:20.094 --> 00:03:23.520
Lungs become healthier 
after about one month,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.875
with less coughing 
and shortness of breath.

00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:28.999
The delicate hair-like cilia 
in the airways and lungs

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:31.077
start recovering within weeks,

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:35.340
and are restored after 9 months, 
improving resistance to infection.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.717
By the one-year anniversary of quitting,

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:42.761
heart disease risk plummets to half
as blood vessel function improves.

00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:44.025
Five years in,

00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:46.845
the chance of a clot forming
dramatically declines,

00:03:46.845 --> 00:03:49.751
and the risk of stroke 
continues to reduce.

00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:53.352
After ten years, the chances 
of developing fatal lung cancer

00:03:53.352 --> 00:03:55.398
go down by 50%,

00:03:55.398 --> 00:04:00.169
probably because the body’s ability 
to repair DNA is once again restored.

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:04.008
Fifteen years in, the likelihood 
of developing coronary heart disease

00:04:04.008 --> 00:04:07.522
is essentially the same 
as that of a non-smoker.

00:04:07.522 --> 00:04:10.818
There’s no point pretending 
this is all easy to achieve.

00:04:10.818 --> 00:04:13.640
Quitting can lead to anxiety 
and depression,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.582
resulting from nicotine withdrawal.

00:04:15.582 --> 00:04:19.292
But fortunately, 
such effects are usually temporary.

00:04:19.292 --> 00:04:23.980
And quitting is getting easier,
thanks to a growing arsenal of tools.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.426
Nicotine replacement therapy through gum,

00:04:26.426 --> 00:04:27.655
skin patches,

00:04:27.655 --> 00:04:28.439
lozenges,

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:29.352
and sprays

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:32.345
may help wean smokers off cigarettes.

00:04:32.345 --> 00:04:35.458
They work by stimulating 
nicotine receptors in the brain

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:37.850
and thus preventing withdrawal symptoms,

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.758
without the addition 
of other harmful chemicals.

00:04:40.758 --> 00:04:42.470
Counselling and support groups,

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.413
cognitive behavioral therapy,

00:04:44.413 --> 00:04:46.606
and moderate intensity exercise

00:04:46.606 --> 00:04:50.061
also help smokers stay cigarette-free.

00:04:50.061 --> 00:04:51.608
That’s good news,

00:04:51.608 --> 00:04:56.256
since quitting puts you and your body 
on the path back to health.
