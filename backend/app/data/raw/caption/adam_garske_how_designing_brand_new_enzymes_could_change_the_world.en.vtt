00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:16.016
Growing up in central Wisconsin,
I spent a lot of time outside.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.087
In the spring, I'd smell
the heady fragrance of lilacs.

00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:22.331
In the summer, I loved
the electric glow of fireflies

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.529
as they would zip around on muggy nights.

00:00:24.553 --> 00:00:28.029
In the fall, the bogs were brimming
with the bright red of cranberries.

00:00:28.776 --> 00:00:30.553
Even winter had its charms,

00:00:30.577 --> 00:00:33.149
with the Christmassy bouquet
emanating from pine trees.

00:00:33.173 --> 00:00:36.339
For me, nature has always been
a source of wonder and inspiration.

00:00:37.292 --> 00:00:40.347
As I went on to graduate school
in chemistry, and in later years,

00:00:40.371 --> 00:00:43.497
I came to better understand
the natural world in molecular detail.

00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:45.291
All the things that I just mentioned,

00:00:45.315 --> 00:00:47.514
from the scents of lilacs and pines

00:00:47.538 --> 00:00:50.307
to the bright red of cranberries
and the glow of fireflies,

00:00:50.331 --> 00:00:52.156
have at least one thing in common:

00:00:52.482 --> 00:00:54.615
they're manufactured by enzymes.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.330
As I said, I grew up in Wisconsin,
so of course, I like cheese

00:00:58.354 --> 00:01:00.069
and the Green Bay Packers.

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:02.061
But let's talk about cheese for a minute.

00:01:02.085 --> 00:01:03.712
For at least the last 7,000 years,

00:01:03.736 --> 00:01:06.014
humans have extracted a mixture of enzymes

00:01:06.038 --> 00:01:08.760
from the stomachs of cows
and sheep and goats

00:01:08.784 --> 00:01:09.998
and added it to milk.

00:01:10.022 --> 00:01:13.451
This causes the milk to curdle --
it's part of the cheese-making process.

00:01:13.475 --> 00:01:15.855
The key enzyme in this mixture
is called chymosin.

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:17.704
I want to show you how that works.

00:01:17.728 --> 00:01:19.626
Right here, I've got two tubes,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.856
and I'm going to add chymosin
to one of these.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.147
Just a second here.

00:01:23.744 --> 00:01:27.206
Now my son Anthony,
who is eight years old,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.508
was very interested in helping me
figure out a demo for the TED Talk,

00:01:30.532 --> 00:01:34.652
and so we were in the kitchen,
we were slicing up pineapples,

00:01:34.676 --> 00:01:38.610
extracting enzymes from red potatoes

00:01:38.634 --> 00:01:40.713
and doing all kinds of demos
in the kitchen.

00:01:40.737 --> 00:01:41.896
And in the end, though,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.086
we thought the chymosin demo
was pretty cool.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.506
And so what's happening here

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.529
is the chymosin
is swimming around in the milk,

00:01:49.553 --> 00:01:52.672
and it's binding to a protein
there called casein.

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:54.974
What it does then
is it clips the casein --

00:01:54.998 --> 00:01:56.800
it's like a molecular scissors.

00:01:57.102 --> 00:02:01.141
It's that clipping action
that causes the milk to curdle.

00:02:01.165 --> 00:02:03.935
So here we are in the kitchen,
working on this.

00:02:04.332 --> 00:02:05.506
OK.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.664
So let me give this a quick zip.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.657
And then we'll set these to the side
and let these simmer for a minute.

00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:12.831
OK.

00:02:15.506 --> 00:02:17.085
If DNA is the blueprint of life,

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:19.985
enzymes are the laborers
that carry out its instructions.

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:22.055
An enzyme is a protein that's a catalyst,

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.898
it speeds up or accelerates
a chemical reaction,

00:02:24.922 --> 00:02:28.398
just as the chymosin over here
is accelerating the curdling of the milk.

00:02:28.914 --> 00:02:30.669
But it's not just about cheese.

00:02:30.693 --> 00:02:34.010
While enzymes do play an important role
in the foods that we eat,

00:02:34.034 --> 00:02:37.478
they also are involved in everything
from the health of an infant

00:02:37.502 --> 00:02:39.812
to attacking the biggest
environmental challenges

00:02:39.836 --> 00:02:40.986
we have today.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.093
The basic building blocks of enzymes
are called amino acids.

00:02:45.482 --> 00:02:47.054
There are 20 common amino acids,

00:02:47.078 --> 00:02:50.435
and we typically designate them
with single-letter abbreviations,

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.887
so it's really an alphabet of amino acids.

00:02:53.236 --> 00:02:55.776
In an enzyme, these amino acids
are strung together,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.239
like pearls on a necklace.

00:02:57.263 --> 00:02:59.815
And it's really the identity
of the amino acids,

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:01.525
which letters are in that necklace,

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.819
and in what order they are,
what they spell out,

00:03:03.843 --> 00:03:07.926
that gives an enzyme its unique properties
and differentiates it from other enzymes.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.266
Now, this string of amino acids,

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.456
this necklace,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.356
folds up into a higher-order structure.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.688
And if you were to zoom in
at the molecular level

00:03:15.712 --> 00:03:18.908
and take a look at chymosin,
which is the enzyme working over here,

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:20.545
you would see it looks like this.

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.680
It's all these strands and loops
and helices and twists and turns,

00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:26.612
and it has to be in just
this conformation to work properly.

00:03:27.038 --> 00:03:29.768
Nowadays, we can make enzymes in microbes,

00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:32.627
and that can be like a bacteria
or a yeast, for example.

00:03:32.982 --> 00:03:35.411
And the way we do this
is we get a piece of DNA

00:03:35.435 --> 00:03:37.800
that codes for an enzyme
that we're interested in,

00:03:37.824 --> 00:03:39.387
we insert that into the microbe,

00:03:39.411 --> 00:03:42.871
and we let the microbe use
its own machinery, its own wherewithal,

00:03:42.895 --> 00:03:45.029
to produce that enzyme for us.

00:03:45.053 --> 00:03:48.460
So if you wanted chymosin,
you wouldn't need a calf, nowadays --

00:03:48.484 --> 00:03:50.198
you could get this from a microbe.

00:03:50.222 --> 00:03:51.761
And what's even cooler, I think,

00:03:51.785 --> 00:03:54.277
is we can now dial in
completely custom DNA sequences

00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:55.888
to make whatever enzymes we want,

00:03:55.912 --> 00:03:57.732
stuff that's not out there in nature.

00:03:57.756 --> 00:03:59.608
And, to me, what's really the fun part

00:03:59.632 --> 00:04:02.283
is trying to design an enzyme
for a new application,

00:04:02.307 --> 00:04:04.617
arranging the atoms just so.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.570
The act of taking an enzyme from nature
and playing with those amino acids,

00:04:09.594 --> 00:04:11.006
tinkering with those letters,

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.371
putting some letters in,
taking some letters out,

00:04:13.395 --> 00:04:15.140
maybe rearranging them a little bit,

00:04:15.164 --> 00:04:16.855
is a little bit like finding a book

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:19.997
and editing a few chapters
or changing the ending.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.696
In 2018, the Nobel prize in chemistry

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.911
was given for the development
of this approach,

00:04:24.935 --> 00:04:27.030
which is known as directed evolution.

00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:31.799
Nowadays, we can harness
the powers of directed evolution

00:04:31.823 --> 00:04:33.910
to design enzymes for custom purposes,

00:04:33.934 --> 00:04:38.887
and one of these is designing enzymes
for doing applications in new areas,

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:40.069
like laundry.

00:04:40.093 --> 00:04:41.592
So just as enzymes in your body

00:04:41.616 --> 00:04:44.236
can help you to break down
the food that you eat,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.856
enzymes in your laundry detergent

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.109
can help you to break down
the stains on your clothes.

00:04:49.515 --> 00:04:52.125
It turns out that about
90 percent of the energy

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:53.626
that goes into doing the wash

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.800
is from water heating.

00:04:55.165 --> 00:04:56.591
And that's for good reason --

00:04:56.615 --> 00:04:58.947
the warmer water
helps to get your clothes clean.

00:04:58.971 --> 00:05:01.998
But what if you were able
to do the wash in cold water instead?

00:05:02.022 --> 00:05:03.768
You certainly would save some money,

00:05:03.792 --> 00:05:04.967
and in addition to that,

00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:07.720
according to some calculations
done by Procter and Gamble,

00:05:07.744 --> 00:05:10.831
if all households in the US
were to do the laundry in cold water,

00:05:10.855 --> 00:05:15.870
we would save the emissions
of 32 metric tons of CO2 each year.

00:05:15.894 --> 00:05:17.077
That's a lot,

00:05:17.101 --> 00:05:18.417
that's about the equivalent

00:05:18.441 --> 00:05:21.616
of the carbon dioxide
emitted by 6.3 million cars.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.996
So, how would we go
about designing an enzyme

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.338
to realize these changes?

00:05:25.362 --> 00:05:28.123
Enzymes didn't evolve
to clean dirty laundry,

00:05:28.147 --> 00:05:29.747
much less in cold water.

00:05:30.282 --> 00:05:33.347
But we can go to nature,
and we can find a starting point.

00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:35.982
We can find an enzyme
that has some starting activity,

00:05:36.006 --> 00:05:37.687
some clay that we can work with.

00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:40.807
So this is an example of such an enzyme,
right here on the screen.

00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:43.688
And we can start playing
with those amino acids, as I said,

00:05:43.712 --> 00:05:46.149
putting some letters in,
taking some letters out,

00:05:46.173 --> 00:05:47.340
rearranging those.

00:05:47.364 --> 00:05:50.434
And in doing so, we can generate
thousands of enzymes.

00:05:50.458 --> 00:05:52.966
And we can take those enzymes,

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.566
and we can test them
in little plates like this.

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:59.220
So this plate that I'm holding in my hands

00:05:59.244 --> 00:06:00.855
contains 96 wells,

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:04.966
and in each well is a piece of fabric
with a stain on it.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.331
And we can measure
how well each of these enzymes

00:06:07.355 --> 00:06:10.014
are able to remove the stains
from the pieces of fabric,

00:06:10.038 --> 00:06:12.060
and in that way see how well it's working.

00:06:12.084 --> 00:06:13.807
And we can do this using robotics,

00:06:13.831 --> 00:06:16.345
like you'll see
in just a second on the screen.

00:06:19.427 --> 00:06:21.744
OK, so we do this, and it turns out

00:06:21.768 --> 00:06:24.220
that some of the enzymes
are sort of in the ballpark

00:06:24.244 --> 00:06:25.434
of the starting enzyme.

00:06:25.458 --> 00:06:27.149
That's nothing to write home about.

00:06:27.173 --> 00:06:29.561
Some are worse, so we get rid of those.

00:06:29.585 --> 00:06:30.910
And then some are better.

00:06:30.934 --> 00:06:33.569
Those improved ones
become our version 1.0s.

00:06:33.593 --> 00:06:36.033
Those are the enzymes
that we want to carry forward,

00:06:36.037 --> 00:06:38.133
and we can repeat this cycle
again and again.

00:06:38.157 --> 00:06:41.936
And it's the repetition of this cycle
that lets us come up with a new enzyme,

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.782
something that can do what we want.

00:06:43.806 --> 00:06:45.394
And after several cycles of this,

00:06:45.418 --> 00:06:47.068
we did come up with something new.

00:06:47.092 --> 00:06:50.632
So you can go to the supermarket today,
and you can buy a laundry detergent

00:06:50.656 --> 00:06:54.553
that lets you do the wash in cold water
because of enzymes like this here.

00:06:54.577 --> 00:06:57.037
And I want to show you
how this one works too.

00:06:57.061 --> 00:06:59.761
So I've got two more tubes here,

00:06:59.785 --> 00:07:02.185
and these are both milk again.

00:07:02.518 --> 00:07:03.669
And let me show you,

00:07:03.693 --> 00:07:06.010
I've got one that I'm going
to add this enzyme to

00:07:06.034 --> 00:07:08.343
and one that I'm going
to add some water to.

00:07:08.367 --> 00:07:09.519
And that's the control,

00:07:09.543 --> 00:07:11.371
so nothing should happen in that tube.

00:07:11.395 --> 00:07:14.617
You might find it curious
that I'm doing this with milk.

00:07:14.641 --> 00:07:16.283
But the reason that I'm doing this

00:07:16.307 --> 00:07:19.196
is because milk
is just loaded with proteins,

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.939
and it's very easy to see
this enzyme working in a protein solution,

00:07:22.963 --> 00:07:25.601
because it's a master protein chopper,

00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:26.775
that's its job.

00:07:27.133 --> 00:07:28.933
So let me get this in here.

00:07:30.323 --> 00:07:34.307
And you know, as I said,
it's a master protein chopper

00:07:34.331 --> 00:07:38.243
and what you can do is you can extrapolate
what it's doing in this milk

00:07:38.267 --> 00:07:40.283
to what it would be doing in your laundry.

00:07:40.307 --> 00:07:43.286
So this is kind of a way to visualize
what would be happening.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.044
OK, so those both went in.

00:07:46.081 --> 00:07:50.168
And I'm going to give this
a quick zip as well.

00:07:55.017 --> 00:07:58.787
OK, so we'll let these sit over here
with the chymosin sample,

00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:01.192
so I'm going to come back
to those toward the end.

00:08:03.152 --> 00:08:06.085
Well, what's on the horizon
for enzyme design?

00:08:06.109 --> 00:08:07.789
Certainly, it will get it faster --

00:08:07.813 --> 00:08:09.924
there are now approaches
for evolving enzymes

00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:12.440
that allow researchers to go
through far more samples

00:08:12.464 --> 00:08:14.084
than I just showed you.

00:08:14.108 --> 00:08:16.494
And in addition to tinkering
with natural enzymes,

00:08:16.518 --> 00:08:17.950
like we've been talking about,

00:08:17.974 --> 00:08:20.918
some scientists are now trying to design
enzymes from scratch,

00:08:20.942 --> 00:08:24.682
using machine learning,
an approach from artificial intelligence,

00:08:24.706 --> 00:08:26.664
to inform their enzyme designs.

00:08:26.688 --> 00:08:30.791
Still others are adding
unnatural amino acids to the mix.

00:08:30.815 --> 00:08:33.030
We talked about
the 20 natural amino acids,

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:34.637
the common amino acids, before --

00:08:34.661 --> 00:08:36.416
they're adding unnatural amino acids

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.050
to make enzymes with properties unlike
those that could be found in nature.

00:08:40.074 --> 00:08:41.728
That's a pretty neat area.

00:08:42.211 --> 00:08:46.848
How will designed enzymes affect you
in years to come?

00:08:46.872 --> 00:08:48.872
Well, I want to focus on two areas:

00:08:48.896 --> 00:08:51.096
human health and the environment.

00:08:52.142 --> 00:08:53.563
Some pharmaceutical companies

00:08:53.587 --> 00:08:56.933
now have teams that are dedicated
to designing enzymes

00:08:56.957 --> 00:09:00.825
to make drugs more efficiently
and with fewer toxic catalysts.

00:09:00.849 --> 00:09:02.445
For example, Januvia,

00:09:02.469 --> 00:09:04.707
which is a medication to treat
type 2 diabetes,

00:09:04.731 --> 00:09:06.262
is made partially with enzymes.

00:09:06.286 --> 00:09:09.630
The number of drugs made with enzymes
is sure to grow in the future.

00:09:10.536 --> 00:09:11.694
In another area,

00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:13.004
there are certain disorders

00:09:13.028 --> 00:09:16.147
in which a single enzyme
in a person's body doesn't work properly.

00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:18.393
An example of this
is called phenylketonuria,

00:09:18.417 --> 00:09:19.631
or PKU for short.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.303
People with PKU are unable to properly
metabolize or digest phenylalanine,

00:09:24.327 --> 00:09:27.961
which is one of the 20 common amino acids
that we've been talking about.

00:09:27.985 --> 00:09:31.802
The consequence of ingesting phenylalanine
for people with PKU

00:09:31.826 --> 00:09:36.357
is that they are subject
to permanent intellectual disabilities,

00:09:36.381 --> 00:09:38.228
so it's a scary thing to have.

00:09:38.252 --> 00:09:40.046
Now, those of you with kids --

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.617
do you guys have kids, here,
which ones have kids?

00:09:42.641 --> 00:09:43.799
A lot of you.

00:09:43.823 --> 00:09:45.609
So may be familiar with PKUs,

00:09:45.633 --> 00:09:50.553
because all infants in the US
are required to be tested for PKU.

00:09:50.577 --> 00:09:53.941
I remember when Anthony, my son,
had his heel pricked to test for it.

00:09:54.639 --> 00:09:57.219
The big challenge with this
is: What do you eat?

00:09:57.243 --> 00:10:00.743
Phenylalanine is in so many foods,
it's incredibly hard to avoid.

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:03.688
Now, Anthony has a nut allergy,
and I thought that was tough,

00:10:03.712 --> 00:10:06.172
but PKU's on another level of toughness.

00:10:06.196 --> 00:10:09.323
However, new enzymes
may soon enable PKU patients

00:10:09.347 --> 00:10:11.141
to eat whatever they want.

00:10:11.165 --> 00:10:15.355
Recently, the FDA approved an enzyme
designed to treat PKU.

00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:17.006
This is big news for patients,

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.522
and it's actually very big news

00:10:18.546 --> 00:10:21.339
for the field of enzyme-replacement
therapy more generally,

00:10:21.363 --> 00:10:25.275
because there are other targets out there
where this would be a good approach.

00:10:26.726 --> 00:10:28.544
So that was a little bit about health.

00:10:28.568 --> 00:10:30.726
Now I'm going to move to the environment.

00:10:31.155 --> 00:10:33.845
When I read about
the Great Pacific Garbage Patch --

00:10:33.869 --> 00:10:37.117
by the way, that's, like,
this huge island of plastic,

00:10:37.141 --> 00:10:39.410
somewhere between California and Hawaii --

00:10:39.434 --> 00:10:42.682
and about microplastics
pretty much everywhere,

00:10:42.706 --> 00:10:43.872
it's upsetting.

00:10:43.896 --> 00:10:45.918
Plastics aren't going away anytime soon.

00:10:45.942 --> 00:10:48.474
But enzymes may help us
in this area as well.

00:10:48.498 --> 00:10:52.363
Recently, bacteria producing
plastic-degrading enzymes were discovered.

00:10:52.387 --> 00:10:55.022
Efforts are already underway
to design improved versions

00:10:55.046 --> 00:10:56.196
of these enzymes.

00:10:56.585 --> 00:10:59.450
At the same time, there are enzymes
that have been discovered

00:10:59.474 --> 00:11:00.839
and that are being optimized

00:11:00.863 --> 00:11:03.878
to make non-petroleum-derived
biodegradable plastics.

00:11:05.171 --> 00:11:08.845
Enzymes may also offer some help
in capturing greenhouse gases,

00:11:08.869 --> 00:11:12.512
such as carbon dioxide, methane
and nitrous oxide.

00:11:12.536 --> 00:11:14.948
Now, there is no doubt,
these are major challenges,

00:11:14.972 --> 00:11:16.815
and none of them are easy.

00:11:16.839 --> 00:11:20.990
But our ability to harness enzymes
may help us to tackle these in the future,

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.530
so I think that's another area
to be looking forward.

00:11:23.554 --> 00:11:25.561
So now I'm going to get back
to the demo --

00:11:25.585 --> 00:11:26.799
this is the fun part.

00:11:26.823 --> 00:11:30.236
So we'll start with the chymosin samples.

00:11:31.863 --> 00:11:33.593
So let me get these over here.

00:11:33.617 --> 00:11:35.022
And you can see here,

00:11:35.046 --> 00:11:36.951
this is the one that got the water,

00:11:36.975 --> 00:11:38.815
so nothing should happen to this milk.

00:11:38.839 --> 00:11:40.990
This is the one that got the chymosin.

00:11:41.014 --> 00:11:43.641
So you can see that it totally
clarified up here.

00:11:43.665 --> 00:11:45.840
There's all this curdled stuff,
that's cheese,

00:11:45.864 --> 00:11:48.147
we just made cheese
in the last few minutes.

00:11:48.171 --> 00:11:49.324
So this is that reaction

00:11:49.348 --> 00:11:52.664
that people have been doing
for thousands and thousands of years.

00:11:52.688 --> 00:11:55.851
I'm thinking about doing this one
at our next Kids to Work Day demo

00:11:55.875 --> 00:11:57.943
but they can be
a tough crowd, so we'll see.

00:11:57.967 --> 00:11:59.006
(Laughter)

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.339
And then the other one
I want to look at is this one.

00:12:02.363 --> 00:12:06.323
So this is the enzyme
for doing your laundry.

00:12:06.347 --> 00:12:09.855
And you can see that it's different
than the one that has the water added.

00:12:09.879 --> 00:12:11.095
It's kind of clarifying,

00:12:11.119 --> 00:12:13.934
and that's just what you want
for an enzyme in your laundry,

00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:16.141
because you want to be able
to have an enzyme

00:12:16.165 --> 00:12:19.117
that can be a protein chowhound,
just chew them up,

00:12:19.141 --> 00:12:22.397
because you're going to get
different protein stains on your clothes,

00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:24.734
like chocolate milk
or grass stains, for example,

00:12:24.758 --> 00:12:27.552
and something like this
is going to help you get them off.

00:12:27.576 --> 00:12:30.165
And this is also going to be
the thing that allows you

00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:32.961
to do the wash in cold water,
reduce your carbon footprint

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:34.244
and save you some money.

00:12:36.713 --> 00:12:38.308
Well, we've come a long way,

00:12:38.332 --> 00:12:43.078
considering this 7,000-year journey
from enzymes in cheese making

00:12:43.102 --> 00:12:45.355
to the present day and enzyme design.

00:12:45.689 --> 00:12:47.570
We're really at a creative crossroads,

00:12:47.594 --> 00:12:51.856
and with enzymes,
can edit what nature wrote

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.413
or write our own stories with amino acids.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.041
So next time you're outdoors
on a muggy night

00:12:58.065 --> 00:12:59.478
and you see a firefly,

00:12:59.502 --> 00:13:01.136
I hope you think of enzymes.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.533
They're doing amazing things for us today.

00:13:03.557 --> 00:13:05.160
And by design,

00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:07.714
they could be doing
even more amazing things tomorrow.

00:13:07.738 --> 00:13:08.889
Thank you.

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:10.944
(Applause)
