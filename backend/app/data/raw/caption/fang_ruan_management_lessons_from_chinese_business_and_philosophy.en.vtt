00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.222
I love dumplings.

00:00:15.246 --> 00:00:18.936
But I seldom have dumplings
in a restaurant,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.698
because my mom's cooking is the best.

00:00:22.476 --> 00:00:26.942
One day, I happened to take a bite
of Dumpling Xi's dish.

00:00:26.966 --> 00:00:28.316
To my surprise,

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.734
they had a flavor of going home.

00:00:31.458 --> 00:00:34.979
Fresh, chewy and unexpected.

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.948
In addition to being a dumpling lover,

00:00:37.972 --> 00:00:40.361
I actually have a full-time job.

00:00:40.385 --> 00:00:42.440
I am a management consultant,

00:00:42.464 --> 00:00:45.239
so naturally, I was keen to understand

00:00:45.263 --> 00:00:48.330
the reasons behind
those delicious dumplings.

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:50.326
What I didn't expect

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.437
is that this dumpling
triggered my exploration

00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:55.793
of new ways of management in China.

00:00:56.327 --> 00:01:01.397
A change that is deeply rooted
in ancient Chinese philosophies.

00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:05.009
But first, let's go back to the dumplings.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.823
Gāo Défú founded Dumpling Xi 17 years ago.

00:01:09.847 --> 00:01:14.706
Today, the company enjoys 500 stores
with 8,000 employees.

00:01:15.077 --> 00:01:17.077
But it wasn't always the case.

00:01:17.514 --> 00:01:18.783
Three years ago,

00:01:18.807 --> 00:01:21.267
the demand for his dumplings was soaring

00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:24.211
due to consumers' craving
for healthy food.

00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:28.179
But the strong growth
of online food delivery services

00:01:28.203 --> 00:01:31.633
had pulled the consumers away
from store visits,

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:34.180
causing a huge concern for Gāo.

00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:37.482
If I were to advise Gāo back then,

00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:40.743
I would go directly
with the classical approach,

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.482
hiring venture managers,

00:01:42.506 --> 00:01:46.260
providing training on how to integrate
online-offline sales,

00:01:46.284 --> 00:01:50.299
or having some high potentials
fully dedicated to the new job,

00:01:50.323 --> 00:01:52.672
such as a Chief Digital Officer.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.653
But Gāo did something totally different.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.886
He invented a two-hat model.

00:02:00.514 --> 00:02:03.005
Instead of recruiting new executives,

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:06.259
he invited five successful regional heads

00:02:06.283 --> 00:02:09.199
to take on a second role at headquarters.

00:02:10.222 --> 00:02:14.936
The catch was, they had to do it
while still being the frontline managers.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.231
Keep in mind that these people
had no formal training

00:02:19.255 --> 00:02:21.942
or related experience in this field.

00:02:22.307 --> 00:02:25.379
What they did have, though,
was natural strengths

00:02:25.403 --> 00:02:27.347
and a growth mindset.

00:02:29.014 --> 00:02:31.609
When Gāo first told me the idea, I said,

00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:32.878
"Are you sure?

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:35.823
I have seldom seen companies
as large as yours

00:02:35.847 --> 00:02:38.314
having part-time senior executives."

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.315
But Gāo smiled.

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:42.073
"This is my dumpling way."

00:02:43.292 --> 00:02:45.775
Gāo's team was also puzzled.

00:02:46.252 --> 00:02:49.474
In the first three months,
the sales fluctuated,

00:02:49.498 --> 00:02:51.950
some even dropped by 20 percent.

00:02:51.974 --> 00:02:53.847
But Gāo didn't blink.

00:02:54.704 --> 00:02:59.283
The regional heads had to learn new skills
while still doing their job.

00:02:59.307 --> 00:03:02.712
Things like what kinds of dumplings
can be sold online,

00:03:02.736 --> 00:03:05.553
how to digitalize their supply chain.

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.403
After the transition period,

00:03:08.427 --> 00:03:10.133
something magical happened.

00:03:10.157 --> 00:03:11.696
The sales came back.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.022
One year later,

00:03:13.046 --> 00:03:17.339
the company began to launch
its fresh and spicy dumplings online.

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:18.672
Two years later,

00:03:18.696 --> 00:03:22.410
more talents with
start-up dreams were attracted.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.092
More importantly,

00:03:25.116 --> 00:03:29.163
the company began to translate
these individual new capabilities

00:03:29.187 --> 00:03:30.670
into company policies,

00:03:30.694 --> 00:03:32.069
and roll them out.

00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:35.938
A true differentiator
compared with his peers.

00:03:36.427 --> 00:03:38.645
Because most Chinese entrepreneurs

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.423
are very good at growth strategies.

00:03:41.744 --> 00:03:45.457
In Chinese, we call it kāi jiāng kuò tǔ,

00:03:45.481 --> 00:03:47.203
expanding territories,

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:51.298
but not so good at 
what we call zhì guó ān bāng,

00:03:51.322 --> 00:03:53.727
converting individual best practices

00:03:53.751 --> 00:03:56.457
into company policies for the long run.

00:03:57.984 --> 00:04:00.412
The nature of Gāo's approach,

00:04:00.436 --> 00:04:03.491
such as having tolerance
for frontline managers

00:04:03.515 --> 00:04:05.102
to make mistakes,

00:04:05.126 --> 00:04:08.804
or having some new ideas
not coming from the top,

00:04:08.828 --> 00:04:11.724
is not common in China.

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.809
Because they go against our traditions.

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:17.498
In the past 2,000 years,

00:04:17.522 --> 00:04:21.379
Confucianism has been dominant in China,

00:04:21.403 --> 00:04:24.974
which values seniority and authority.

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:29.078
For a nation, this is
a time-tested formula

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.427
to ensure order and harmony.

00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:33.190
For a company,

00:04:33.214 --> 00:04:37.364
this ensures precise execution
at a large scale.

00:04:38.237 --> 00:04:41.841
But with business environments
constantly changing,

00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:44.349
internet disrupting
traditional industries,

00:04:44.373 --> 00:04:47.552
new millennials becoming 
a major workforce,

00:04:47.556 --> 00:04:50.293
new ways of management emerge.

00:04:51.046 --> 00:04:55.466
I feel so lucky to study this
in such a dynamic age,

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.656
while at the same time

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.672
to satisfy my stomach
with delicious dumplings.

00:05:02.117 --> 00:05:05.243
Gāo's two-hat approach
is just one example.

00:05:05.675 --> 00:05:08.761
Another example comes from Miranda Qu,

00:05:08.785 --> 00:05:10.834
the founder of Xiaohongshu.

00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:16.986
Xiaohongshu is a thriving internet company
with 300 million users.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.772
It is an online community
where young fans can get together

00:05:20.796 --> 00:05:24.320
to talk about their favorite
soap opera, "Go Go Squid!"

00:05:24.344 --> 00:05:27.097
Or buy the cool shoes
that the lead actress wears

00:05:27.121 --> 00:05:28.387
in a running scene.

00:05:29.435 --> 00:05:30.966
From the early days,

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.651
Qu wanted the whole organization
to be ready to spot things

00:05:34.675 --> 00:05:35.855
that need to change

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:37.746
and challenge the authority.

00:05:38.554 --> 00:05:39.720
But one day,

00:05:39.744 --> 00:05:44.457
she noticed her interns
were calling senior staff "teachers."

00:05:45.268 --> 00:05:47.371
This may sound innocent,

00:05:47.395 --> 00:05:49.528
but it signaled a problem to Qu.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.077
Because if the teacher
phenomenon becomes a norm,

00:05:53.101 --> 00:05:57.288
it will encourage hierarchy
and discourage ownership.

00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.942
This is also something
related to Confucian thinking.

00:06:00.966 --> 00:06:03.609
In Chinese, we call it "benfen."

00:06:04.113 --> 00:06:06.652
"Ben" means me, myself.

00:06:06.676 --> 00:06:09.327
"Fen" means the share of the job.

00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:12.335
"I will just focus on my job
and not cross any lines,"

00:06:12.359 --> 00:06:15.687
which is totally the opposite
to Qu's thinking.

00:06:16.487 --> 00:06:21.160
So Qu created a unique initiative
called "Signature Program."

00:06:22.098 --> 00:06:23.368
In the program,

00:06:23.392 --> 00:06:26.530
each employee chooses an avatar character

00:06:26.554 --> 00:06:30.066
that pops up alongside
digital communication channels.

00:06:30.395 --> 00:06:34.474
Some common ideas include
Captain Hook, Harry Potter

00:06:34.498 --> 00:06:38.098
and many well-known characters
in Chinese literature.

00:06:38.427 --> 00:06:43.541
The way these characters interact
proved to be the answer to Qu's problem.

00:06:44.323 --> 00:06:47.367
Avatars from the same story
would get together

00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:50.040
to talk about their favorite characters.

00:06:50.064 --> 00:06:53.675
In the community called "Slam Dunk,"

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:57.037
people from different cities,
different departments,

00:06:57.061 --> 00:06:59.077
different levels of the organization,

00:06:59.101 --> 00:07:03.085
they would talk about how these characters
inspired them at work.

00:07:04.307 --> 00:07:08.347
An employee with a signature 
called Coach Anzai

00:07:08.371 --> 00:07:11.831
was facing some difficulty
in leading a very young team.

00:07:12.252 --> 00:07:14.713
Other Dunk fans will share
the best practices

00:07:14.737 --> 00:07:17.921
on how to motivate a diversified team

00:07:17.945 --> 00:07:21.279
and inspire them to work
to their full potential.

00:07:22.253 --> 00:07:25.768
The signature program plays a pivotal role

00:07:25.792 --> 00:07:29.424
in fostering a collaborative
environment at Xiaohongshu.

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:33.466
Not only the teacher issue
has disappeared,

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.330
the company has been ranked

00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:39.233
as one of the most innovative
Chinese companies by Forbes

00:07:39.257 --> 00:07:41.331
in the past two years.

00:07:43.157 --> 00:07:46.791
Gāo's two-hat approach
and Qu's signature program

00:07:46.815 --> 00:07:50.443
are just two examples of empowering
the frontline staff.

00:07:51.133 --> 00:07:54.834
But these methods may not always be right.

00:07:55.302 --> 00:07:57.617
Let's take Ping An, for example.

00:07:57.641 --> 00:07:59.907
Very successful insurance company.

00:08:00.378 --> 00:08:02.276
The company couldn't adopt

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.379
such an approach
for the whole organization,

00:08:04.403 --> 00:08:09.852
because, one, the company has
400,000 employees,

00:08:09.876 --> 00:08:15.800
and the line between innovative chaos
and chaotic chaos is very thin.

00:08:16.979 --> 00:08:21.783
Two, the company has five ecosystems
and 10-plus sectors --

00:08:21.807 --> 00:08:24.498
health care, insurance,

00:08:24.522 --> 00:08:26.458
real estate, smart city.

00:08:26.482 --> 00:08:30.807
Very difficult to apply
a bottom-up innovation to all.

00:08:31.284 --> 00:08:34.403
But the company
still needs to be innovating.

00:08:35.188 --> 00:08:37.220
Ma Mingzhe, the founder,

00:08:37.244 --> 00:08:40.037
positions the headquarters
as the steering wheel.

00:08:40.569 --> 00:08:43.198
Steering innovations and new ideas,

00:08:43.222 --> 00:08:46.085
cascading them down to its subsidiaries.

00:08:47.133 --> 00:08:50.283
One of the ideas
that headquarters came up with

00:08:50.307 --> 00:08:52.950
is AI-enabled loss assessment.

00:08:54.069 --> 00:08:56.522
For a not-so-complicated case,

00:08:56.546 --> 00:09:00.078
the car owner can take a picture
of the damaged car,

00:09:00.102 --> 00:09:01.768
upload it online.

00:09:01.792 --> 00:09:05.719
The insurance center
can decide a claim amount right away

00:09:05.743 --> 00:09:08.831
by AI-enabled loss assessment.

00:09:09.434 --> 00:09:12.633
Facial recognition, ID verification.

00:09:12.657 --> 00:09:15.926
The car owner can get a payment
in a few minutes,

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.217
which could have taken a few days.

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:25.000
So, for companies that [find it] difficult
to conduct grassroots innovation,

00:09:25.024 --> 00:09:28.380
a centralized approach is also an option.

00:09:30.007 --> 00:09:34.634
The more I see these unconventional
management mechanisms --

00:09:34.658 --> 00:09:36.483
Gāo with two hats,

00:09:36.507 --> 00:09:38.928
Qu with the signature program

00:09:38.952 --> 00:09:40.666
and Ma with the steering wheel --

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:44.878
the more I ponder where
do these mechanisms come from.

00:09:45.665 --> 00:09:48.212
They're definitely not Confucian.

00:09:48.538 --> 00:09:51.855
They are very similar
to another Asian school of thought,

00:09:51.879 --> 00:09:53.029
Taoism.

00:09:54.276 --> 00:09:58.109
Confucianism believes
the way to achieve perfection

00:09:58.133 --> 00:10:00.857
is to organize and regulate things.

00:10:01.286 --> 00:10:06.532
But Taoism believes in letting things
work to their perfection naturally,

00:10:06.556 --> 00:10:08.484
to support their natural state

00:10:08.508 --> 00:10:11.175
and to let them transform spontaneously.

00:10:11.561 --> 00:10:15.291
In other words, leaders
should not impose their will.

00:10:15.315 --> 00:10:18.633
Leaders should act by shaping the context

00:10:18.657 --> 00:10:19.990
rather than control.

00:10:20.831 --> 00:10:25.685
Confucianism works best
in winning a stable context,

00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:29.392
whereas Taoism, with its power
to shape the context,

00:10:29.416 --> 00:10:32.749
is more effective
in dealing with uncertainty.

00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:38.256
A leader is best when people
barely know he exists.

00:10:38.927 --> 00:10:41.845
When work is done, people say,

00:10:41.869 --> 00:10:44.010
"We did it ourselves."

00:10:45.389 --> 00:10:46.539
Thank you.

00:10:46.563 --> 00:10:49.371
(Applause)
