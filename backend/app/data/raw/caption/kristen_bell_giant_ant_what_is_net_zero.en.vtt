00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.245
What is net zero?

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:08.466
We release 55 gigatons of greenhouse gases
into the air every year.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.976
To stop global warming,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.856
we have to get our greenhouse
gas emissions down to zero.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.736
But for every country
to immediately shut down

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.966
all greenhouse gas-releasing activities

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.051
would be an enormous challenge,

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:22.626
especially since some countries

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.269
have built up an economic head start
with no restrictions.

00:00:26.293 --> 00:00:30.586
So instead, we can use
an approach called net zero.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.590
Net zero means that for every molecule
of greenhouse gas we put into the air,

00:00:35.614 --> 00:00:37.478
we also take one out,

00:00:37.502 --> 00:00:40.184
making our net emissions zero.

00:00:40.208 --> 00:00:43.266
Net zero requires us
to make big changes today,

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.206
use less more efficiently,

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.266
and even bigger technological
changes for the future,

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.396
like replacing all greenhouse gas-emitting
activities with clean ones.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.136
We'll also have to capture
greenhouse gases from the air

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.957
and store them permanently.

00:00:57.672 --> 00:01:02.553
And yet, net zero is our best chance
for a sustainable future.
