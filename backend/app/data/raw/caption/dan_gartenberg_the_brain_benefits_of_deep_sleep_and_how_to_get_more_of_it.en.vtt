00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.376
What if you could make
your sleep more efficient?

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.136
As a sleep scientist,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.056
this is the question
that has captivated me

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.640
for the past 10 years.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.936
Because while the lightbulb
and technology have brought about a world

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.416
of 24-hour work and productivity,

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.096
it has come at the cost

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.416
of our naturally occurring
circadian rhythm

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.640
and our body's need for sleep.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.456
The circadian rhythm dictates
our energy level throughout the day,

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:49.336
and only recently we've been conducting
a global experiment on this rhythm,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.416
which is putting our sleep health

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.840
and ultimately
our life quality in jeopardy.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.496
Because of this,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.656
we aren't getting the sleep we need,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.416
with the average American
sleeping a whole hour less

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.936
than they did in the 1940s.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.216
For some reason,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.496
we decided to wear it as a badge of honor

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.760
that we can get by on not enough sleep.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.120
This all adds up to a real health crisis.

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:20.536
Most of us know that poor sleep
is linked to diseases

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.296
like Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.360
stroke and diabetes.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.696
And if you go untreated
with a sleep disorder like sleep apnea,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.480
you're more likely
to get many of these illnesses.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.480
But did you know about sleep's impact
on your mental states?

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.736
Poor sleep makes us
make risky, rash decisions

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.720
and is a drain
on our capacity for empathy.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.136
When sleep deprivation literally makes us
more sensitive to our own pain,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.176
it's not so surprising that we have
a hard time relating to others

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.416
and just generally
being a good and healthy person

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.920
when we're sleep-deprived.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.296
Scientists are now starting to understand

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.496
how not only the quantity

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.320
but also the quality of sleep
impacts our health and well-being.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.176
My research focuses

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.216
on what many scientists believe
is the most regenerative stage of sleep:

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.440
deep sleep.

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:23.256
We now know that generally speaking,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.896
there are three stages of sleep:

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.256
light sleep,

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.296
rapid eye movement or REM

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.520
and deep sleep.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.760
We measure these stages by connecting
electrodes to the scalp, chin and chest.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.056
In light sleep and REM,

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.320
our brain waves are very similar
to our brain waves in waking life.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.816
But our brain waves in deep sleep
have these long-burst brain waves

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.976
that are very different
from our waking life brain waves.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.400
These long-burst brain waves
are called delta waves.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.056
When we don't get the deep sleep we need,

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.256
it inhibits our ability to learn

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.080
and for our cells and bodies to recover.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.096
Deep sleep is how we convert
all those interactions

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.816
that we make during the day

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.560
into our long-term memory
and personalities.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.456
As we get older,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.976
we're more likely to lose
these regenerative delta waves.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.816
So in way, deep sleep and delta waves

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.480
are actually a marker
for biological youth.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.216
So naturally, I wanted to get
more deep sleep for myself

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:34.936
and I literally tried almost every gadget,
gizmo, device and hack out there --

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.896
consumer-grade, clinical-grade,

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.120
what have you.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.536
I learned a lot, and I found
I really do need, like most people,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.216
eight hours of sleep.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.296
I even shifted my circadian component

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.016
by changing my meals,
exercise and light exposure,

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.296
but I still couldn't find a way
to get a deeper night of sleep ...

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.376
that is until I met
Dr. Dmitry Gerashchenko

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.696
from Harvard Medical School.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.896
Dmitry told me about
a new finding in the literature,

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.336
where a lab out of Germany showed
that if you could play certain sounds

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.896
at the right time in people's sleep,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.360
you could actually make sleep
deeper and more efficient.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.736
And what's more, is that this lab showed

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.256
that you actually could improve
next-day memory performance

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.480
with this sound.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.456
Dmitry and I teamed up,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.976
and we began working on a way
to build this technology.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.079
With our research lab
collaborators at Penn State,

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.856
we designed experiments
in order to validate our system.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.496
And we've since received grant funding
from the National Science Foundation

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.536
and the National Institute of Health

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.480
to develop this deep-sleep
stimulating technology.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.056
Here's how it works.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.336
People came into the lab

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.736
and we hooked them up
to a number of devices,

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.536
two of which I have on right here --

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.816
not a fashion statement.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.360
(Laughter)

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.016
When we detected
that people were in deep sleep,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.696
we played the deep-sleep
stimulating sounds

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.376
that were shown
to make them have deeper sleep.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.680
I'm going to demo this sound
for you right now.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.040
(Repeating sound waves)

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.816
Pretty weird, right?

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.576
(Laughter)

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:25.056
So that sound is actually at the same
burst frequency as your brain waves

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.416
when your brain is in deep sleep.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.696
That sound pattern
actually primes your mind

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.360
to have more of these
regenerative delta waves.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.016
When we asked participants
the next day about the sounds,

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.936
they were completely unaware
that we played the sounds,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.840
yet their brains responded
with more of these delta waves.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.176
Here's an image of someone's brain waves
from the study that we conducted.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.896
See the bottom panel?

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.416
This shows the sound being played
at that burst frequency.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.536
Now look at the brain waves
in the upper part of the graph.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.496
You can see from the graph

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.000
that the sound is actually producing
more of these regenerative delta waves.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.936
We learned that we could
accurately track sleep

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.656
without hooking people up to electrodes

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.776
and make people sleep deeper.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.216
We're continuing to develop

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.656
the right sound environment
and sleep habitat

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.000
to improve people's sleep health.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.256
Our sleep isn't
as regenerative as it could be,

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.096
but maybe one day soon,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.536
we could wear a small device

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.640
and get more out of our sleep.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.256
Thank you.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.040
(Applause)
