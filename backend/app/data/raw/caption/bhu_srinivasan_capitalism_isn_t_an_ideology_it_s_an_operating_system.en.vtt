00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:14.047
So, what is capitalism?

00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:17.261
Capitalism, fundamentally,
is a series of marketplaces.

00:00:17.285 --> 00:00:19.199
You can have a marketplace for lemonade,

00:00:19.223 --> 00:00:20.508
a marketplace for lemons,

00:00:20.532 --> 00:00:22.911
a marketplace for trucks
that transport lemons,

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:25.490
a marketplace that fuels those trucks,

00:00:25.514 --> 00:00:28.902
marketplaces that sell wood
to build lemonade stands.

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:31.371
However, capitalism of course, as we know,

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:33.831
is this either celebrated term

00:00:33.855 --> 00:00:35.006
or condemned term.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.270
It's either revered or it's reviled.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.004
And I'm here to argue
that this is because capitalism,

00:00:41.028 --> 00:00:44.229
in the modern iteration,
is largely misunderstood.

00:00:44.982 --> 00:00:46.141
In my view,

00:00:46.165 --> 00:00:48.974
capitalism should not
be thought of as an ideology,

00:00:48.998 --> 00:00:52.276
but instead should be thought of
as an operating system.

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:54.117
Think of your iPhone.

00:00:54.762 --> 00:00:58.659
Your iPhone merges hardware with software.

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:00.047
Apps and hardware.

00:01:00.071 --> 00:01:03.808
Now think about all the hardware
as the physical reality all around you,

00:01:03.832 --> 00:01:06.600
and think of the apps
as entrepreneurial activity,

00:01:06.624 --> 00:01:07.774
creative energy.

00:01:08.188 --> 00:01:10.863
And in-between,
you have an operating system.

00:01:11.307 --> 00:01:13.537
As you have advances in hardware,

00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:15.537
you have advances in software.

00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:17.569
And the operating system needs to keep up.

00:01:17.593 --> 00:01:20.529
It needs to be patched,
it needs to be updated,

00:01:20.553 --> 00:01:22.458
new releases have to happen.

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:25.441
And all of these things
have to happen symbiotically.

00:01:25.465 --> 00:01:28.767
The operating system needs
to keep getting more and more advanced

00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:30.591
to keep up with innovation.

00:01:31.728 --> 00:01:34.109
And this is why, fundamentally,

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:36.339
when you think about it
as an operating system,

00:01:36.363 --> 00:01:38.512
it devolves the language of ideology

00:01:38.536 --> 00:01:42.212
away from what traditional
defenders of capitalism think.

00:01:42.236 --> 00:01:44.103
But even if you go to the constitution,

00:01:44.127 --> 00:01:47.374
you'll notice, before the founders
even got to the First Amendment --

00:01:47.398 --> 00:01:50.673
with free speech,
free religion, free press,

00:01:50.697 --> 00:01:53.071
they thought about patents and copyright.

00:01:53.095 --> 00:01:57.267
They talked about the government's role
in promoting arts and sciences.

00:01:57.645 --> 00:02:02.058
It's the reason why I could not start
a search engine tomorrow called Goggle.

00:02:02.082 --> 00:02:03.440
(Laughter)

00:02:03.464 --> 00:02:05.140
Google doesn't own Gs,

00:02:05.164 --> 00:02:07.943
but I couldn't do it
because there could be some confusion.

00:02:07.967 --> 00:02:10.582
So even property rights
have ambiguity built into them.

00:02:11.173 --> 00:02:12.482
And on and on.

00:02:12.506 --> 00:02:16.862
And by 1900, you have other types
of property that come into being.

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:20.743
For instance, imagine that in 1900,
you owned 100 acres of land

00:02:20.767 --> 00:02:22.186
someplace in the Midwest.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.804
It's very easy to see
where your fence ends,

00:02:24.828 --> 00:02:26.462
your neighbor's property begins.

00:02:26.486 --> 00:02:27.649
Now let me ask you,

00:02:27.673 --> 00:02:30.047
where in the sky does your property end?

00:02:30.071 --> 00:02:31.752
Does it end at 1,000 feet,

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:34.117
5,000 feet, 10,000 feet?

00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:35.324
It makes no difference,

00:02:35.348 --> 00:02:38.363
because other than the novelty
of a few hot-air balloons,

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:39.537
man couldn't fly.

00:02:40.053 --> 00:02:41.798
But within three years, he could.

00:02:41.822 --> 00:02:44.752
Now all of a sudden,
it was very much relevant

00:02:44.776 --> 00:02:47.450
whether your land ends
at 1,000 feet in the sky,

00:02:47.474 --> 00:02:49.243
5,000 feet, 10,000 feet.

00:02:49.665 --> 00:02:52.283
And you have to have
someone arbitrate that.

00:02:53.116 --> 00:02:55.077
And indeed, that's exactly what happened.

00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:56.614
And five or ten years from now,

00:02:56.638 --> 00:03:00.226
when Amazon wants to deliver a package
over your house to your neighbor

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.894
from that UPS truck,

00:03:01.918 --> 00:03:05.180
we're going to have to decide:
Does you property end at five feet,

00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:07.912
10 feet, 50 feet, 100 feet?

00:03:07.936 --> 00:03:09.111
Where does it end?

00:03:09.135 --> 00:03:10.858
And there is no ideology

00:03:10.882 --> 00:03:13.447
that will tell you
where your property ends.

00:03:14.132 --> 00:03:15.632
It's an operating system.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.180
And similarly,

00:03:17.205 --> 00:03:19.283
we're going to see this with automobiles.

00:03:19.386 --> 00:03:22.108
A few years after the Wright brothers
figured out flight,

00:03:22.132 --> 00:03:24.304
human beings started using
more and more cars.

00:03:24.328 --> 00:03:25.479
And all of a sudden,

00:03:25.503 --> 00:03:27.789
the regulatory system --
the operating system --

00:03:27.813 --> 00:03:32.387
had to be patched to all of a sudden
address the safety of consumers.

00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:35.538
That the consumers of vehicles
were presenting danger to horses,

00:03:35.562 --> 00:03:38.495
other pedestrians, trolleys,
what have you.

00:03:38.957 --> 00:03:40.108
And all of a sudden,

00:03:40.132 --> 00:03:43.966
the drivers of these automobiles
had to have driver's licenses, eye exams,

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.696
registered motor vehicles, speed limits,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.934
rules of the road,

00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:52.950
so that horses, pedestrians,
could coexist with cars.

00:03:52.974 --> 00:03:55.175
It had to be backwards compatible.

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:59.697
So a new invention had to basically fit
advances from the past.

00:04:00.355 --> 00:04:02.180
Similarly, five or ten years from now,

00:04:02.204 --> 00:04:04.995
we're going to see the same thing
with self-driving cars --

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.149
coexisting with human-driven cars.

00:04:07.173 --> 00:04:09.497
The reason why this is important,
is in 10 years,

00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:12.970
another thing is going to happen
beyond drones and self-driving cars,

00:04:12.994 --> 00:04:16.161
but you're going to see
the most valuable economy in the world --

00:04:16.185 --> 00:04:17.883
the largest economy in the world --

00:04:17.907 --> 00:04:20.175
is going to be a country
run by communists.

00:04:20.558 --> 00:04:23.433
The Chinese seem to be
very good at capitalism.

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:27.946
And this is going to have
fundamental problems

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.548
and present an identity crisis
for the United States.

00:04:31.572 --> 00:04:33.237
Because for a long time,

00:04:33.261 --> 00:04:39.118
free markets coincided with liberties
such as free speech, free press,

00:04:39.204 --> 00:04:40.506
free religion.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.997
And all of a sudden,
this equation is going to be decoupled.

00:04:44.644 --> 00:04:46.004
And when it gets decoupled,

00:04:46.028 --> 00:04:49.696
we might find that democracy,
the multitude of voices,

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.156
actually impedes capitalism

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.186
because a state that does not have
any pretense of limited government

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.752
can very quickly mandate
a regulatory framework for drones,

00:04:59.776 --> 00:05:02.219
for electric cars, for self-driving cars,

00:05:02.243 --> 00:05:04.038
for any new innovation

00:05:04.062 --> 00:05:07.789
where they feel that they can leapfrog
Western societies.

00:05:08.792 --> 00:05:12.672
And this is a very unique thing
in the American experience.

00:05:13.236 --> 00:05:17.133
And this is why it's very important
to think of American capitalism

00:05:17.157 --> 00:05:20.307
as an operating system
and not as an ideology.

00:05:20.331 --> 00:05:22.529
Because when you think about it
as an ideology,

00:05:22.553 --> 00:05:27.666
you can have good politics
make for very, very bad policy.

00:05:28.371 --> 00:05:31.799
That market outcomes and democratic voices

00:05:31.823 --> 00:05:33.474
and battles for votes

00:05:33.498 --> 00:05:35.942
can end up stifling progress.

00:05:37.006 --> 00:05:38.982
So over the next few years,

00:05:39.006 --> 00:05:41.791
as this political cycle plays out,

00:05:41.815 --> 00:05:45.451
you're going to see American democracy

00:05:45.475 --> 00:05:50.973
rise to meet the challenges
that capitalism poses and modernity poses.

00:05:50.997 --> 00:05:54.394
And I ask policymakers to think about --

00:05:55.573 --> 00:05:59.079
decoupling ideology from economics,

00:05:59.103 --> 00:06:03.440
and think about how good policy
can ultimately become good politics.

00:06:03.793 --> 00:06:04.976
Thank you.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.407
(Applause)
