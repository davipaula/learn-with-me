If you look at a carpenter,
they have a toolbox;

00:00:14.762 --> 00:00:16.498
a dentist, they have their drills.

00:00:16.522 --> 00:00:19.188
In our era and the type of work
most of us are doing,

00:00:19.212 --> 00:00:21.888
the tool we most need is actually centered

00:00:21.912 --> 00:00:25.187
around being able to give
and receive feedback well.

00:00:25.211 --> 00:00:27.977
[The Way We Work]

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:32.136
Humans have been talking
about feedback for centuries.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.262
In fact, Confucius, way back in 500 BC,

00:00:35.286 --> 00:00:39.018
talked about how important it is
to be able to say difficult messages well.

00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:41.778
But to be honest,
we're still pretty bad at it.

00:00:41.802 --> 00:00:44.078
In fact, a recent Gallup survey found

00:00:44.102 --> 00:00:48.218
that only 26 percent of employees 
strongly agree

00:00:48.242 --> 00:00:51.608
that the feedback they get
actually improves their work.

00:00:51.632 --> 00:00:53.198
Those numbers are pretty dismal.

00:00:53.222 --> 00:00:54.724
So what's going on?

00:00:54.748 --> 00:00:56.820
The way that most people
give their feedback

00:00:56.844 --> 00:00:58.298
actually isn't brain-friendly.

00:00:58.322 --> 00:01:00.498
People fall into one of two camps.

00:01:00.522 --> 00:01:04.148
Either they're of the camp
that is very indirect and soft

00:01:04.172 --> 00:01:07.443
and the brain doesn't even recognize
that feedback is being given

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:09.178
or it's just simply confused,

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:11.938
or they fall into the other
camp of being too direct,

00:01:11.962 --> 00:01:16.448
and with that, it tips the other person
into the land of being defensive.

00:01:16.472 --> 00:01:18.938
There's this part of the brain
called the amygdala,

00:01:18.962 --> 00:01:21.084
and it's scanning
at all times to figure out

00:01:21.108 --> 00:01:23.878
whether the message
has a social threat attached to it.

00:01:23.902 --> 00:01:26.339
With that, we'll move forward
to defensiveness,

00:01:26.363 --> 00:01:28.308
we'll move backwards in retreat,

00:01:28.332 --> 00:01:32.578
and what happens is the feedback giver
then starts to disregulate as well.

00:01:32.602 --> 00:01:35.348
They add more ums and ahs
and justifications,

00:01:35.372 --> 00:01:38.428
and the whole thing
gets wonky really fast.

00:01:38.452 --> 00:01:39.929
It doesn't have to be this way.

00:01:39.953 --> 00:01:43.318
I and my team have spent many years
going into different companies

00:01:43.342 --> 00:01:46.628
and asking who here
is a great feedback giver.

00:01:46.652 --> 00:01:48.638
Anybody who's named again and again,

00:01:48.662 --> 00:01:52.165
we actually bring into our labs
to see what they're doing differently.

00:01:52.544 --> 00:01:55.618
And what we find
is that there's a four-part formula

00:01:55.642 --> 00:01:58.638
that you can use to say
any difficult message well.

00:01:58.662 --> 00:02:00.671
OK, are you ready for it? Here we go.

00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:03.758
The first part of the formula
is what we call the micro-yes.

00:02:03.782 --> 00:02:06.108
Great feedback givers begin their feedback

00:02:06.132 --> 00:02:09.908
by asking a question
that is short but important.

00:02:09.932 --> 00:02:13.628
It lets the brain know
that feedback is actually coming.

00:02:13.652 --> 00:02:15.657
It would be something, for example, like,

00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:19.101
"Do you have five minutes to talk
about how that last conversation went"

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:21.568
or "I have some ideas
for how we can improve things.

00:02:21.592 --> 00:02:22.914
Can I share them with you?"

00:02:22.938 --> 00:02:25.198
This micro-yes question
does two things for you.

00:02:25.222 --> 00:02:27.609
First of all, it's going to be
a pacing tool.

00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:30.948
It lets the other person know
that feedback is about to be given.

00:02:30.972 --> 00:02:34.148
And the second thing it does
is it creates a moment of buy-in.

00:02:34.172 --> 00:02:36.888
I can say yes or no
to that yes or no question.

00:02:36.912 --> 00:02:39.288
And with that,
I get a feeling of autonomy.

00:02:39.312 --> 00:02:43.070
The second part of the feedback formula
is going to be giving your data point.

00:02:43.094 --> 00:02:46.368
Here, you should name specifically
what you saw or heard,

00:02:46.392 --> 00:02:49.288
and cut out any words
that aren't objective.

00:02:49.312 --> 00:02:51.668
There's a concept we call blur words.

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:55.350
A blur word is something that can mean
different things to different people.

00:02:55.374 --> 00:02:56.928
Blur words are not specific.

00:02:56.952 --> 00:03:00.397
So for example, if I say
"You shouldn't be so defensive"

00:03:00.421 --> 00:03:02.418
or "You could be more proactive."

00:03:02.442 --> 00:03:04.938
What we see great feedback
givers doing differently

00:03:04.962 --> 00:03:08.268
is they'll convert their blur words
into actual data points.

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:10.668
So for example, instead of saying,

00:03:10.692 --> 00:03:12.218
"You aren't reliable,"

00:03:12.242 --> 00:03:15.858
we would say, "You said you'd get
that email to me by 11,

00:03:15.882 --> 00:03:17.368
and I still don't have it yet."

00:03:17.392 --> 00:03:20.858
Specificity is also important
when it comes to positive feedback,

00:03:20.882 --> 00:03:24.378
and the reason for that is that we want
to be able to specify exactly

00:03:24.402 --> 00:03:27.958
what we want the other person
to increase or diminish.

00:03:27.982 --> 00:03:29.568
And if we stick with blur words,

00:03:29.592 --> 00:03:31.782
they actually won't have
any clue particularly

00:03:31.806 --> 00:03:34.528
what to do going forward
to keep repeating that behavior.

00:03:34.552 --> 00:03:37.528
The third part of the feedback
formula is the impact statement.

00:03:37.552 --> 00:03:40.488
Here, you name exactly
how that data point impacted you.

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:43.568
So, for example, I might say,
"Because I didn't get the message,

00:03:43.592 --> 00:03:46.058
I was blocked on my work
and couldn't move forward"

00:03:46.082 --> 00:03:48.418
or "I really liked
how you added those stories,

00:03:48.442 --> 00:03:50.848
because it helped me
grasp the concepts faster."

00:03:50.872 --> 00:03:52.349
It gives you a sense of purpose

00:03:52.373 --> 00:03:55.168
and meaning and logic between the points,

00:03:55.192 --> 00:03:57.518
which is something
the brain really craves.

00:03:57.542 --> 00:04:01.098
The fourth part of the feedback
formula is a question.

00:04:01.122 --> 00:04:05.338
Great feedback givers wrap
their feedback message with a question.

00:04:05.362 --> 00:04:06.648
They'll ask something like,

00:04:06.672 --> 00:04:08.068
"Well, how do you see it?"

00:04:08.092 --> 00:04:10.868
Or "This is what I'm thinking
we should do,

00:04:10.892 --> 00:04:12.588
but what are your thoughts on it?"

00:04:12.612 --> 00:04:15.868
What it does is it creates commitment
rather than just compliance.

00:04:15.892 --> 00:04:18.738
It makes the conversation
no longer be a monologue,

00:04:18.762 --> 00:04:22.458
but rather becomes a joint
problem-solving situation.

00:04:22.482 --> 00:04:23.768
But there's one last thing.

00:04:23.792 --> 00:04:26.708
Great feedback givers
not only can say messages well,

00:04:26.732 --> 00:04:29.368
but also, they ask for feedback regularly.

00:04:29.392 --> 00:04:31.687
In fact, our research
on perceived leadership

00:04:31.711 --> 00:04:35.348
shows that you shouldn't
wait for feedback to be given to you --

00:04:35.372 --> 00:04:37.258
what we call push feedback --

00:04:37.282 --> 00:04:39.938
but rather, you should
actively ask for feedback,

00:04:39.962 --> 00:04:41.748
what we call pulling feedback.

00:04:41.772 --> 00:04:45.238
Pulling feedback establishes you
as a continual learner

00:04:45.262 --> 00:04:47.408
and puts the power in your hands.

00:04:47.432 --> 00:04:49.085
The most challenging situations

00:04:49.109 --> 00:04:52.088
are actually the ones
that call for the most skillful feedback.

00:04:52.112 --> 00:04:53.808
But it doesn't have to be hard.

00:04:53.832 --> 00:04:55.808
Now that you know this four-part formula,

00:04:55.832 --> 00:05:00.039
you can mix and match it to make it work
for any difficult conversation.
