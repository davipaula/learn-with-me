00:00:12.755 --> 00:00:16.686
So many of us who care
about sustainable development

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.757
and the livelihood of local people

00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:20.476
do so for deeply personal reasons.

00:00:22.507 --> 00:00:23.897
I grew up in Cameroon,

00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:27.510
a country of enchanting beauty
and rich biodiversity,

00:00:27.534 --> 00:00:31.351
but plagued by poor governance,
environmental destruction, and poverty.

00:00:32.444 --> 00:00:37.504
As a child, like we see with most children
in sub-Saharan Africa today,

00:00:37.528 --> 00:00:39.438
I regularly suffered from malaria.

00:00:39.462 --> 00:00:44.190
To this day, more than one million people
die from malaria every year,

00:00:44.214 --> 00:00:46.582
mostly children under the age of five,

00:00:46.606 --> 00:00:49.566
with 90 percent occurring
in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:54.259
When I was 18, I left Cameroon

00:00:54.283 --> 00:00:56.497
in search of better
educational opportunities.

00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:00.338
At the time, there was
just one university in Cameroon,

00:01:00.362 --> 00:01:02.886
but Nigeria next door
offered some opportunities

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.544
for Cameroonians of English extraction
to be trained in various fields.

00:01:07.082 --> 00:01:08.938
So I moved there,

00:01:08.962 --> 00:01:10.829
but practicing my trade,

00:01:10.853 --> 00:01:13.035
upon graduation
as an ecologist in Nigeria,

00:01:13.059 --> 00:01:14.512
was an even bigger challenge.

00:01:14.856 --> 00:01:16.416
So I left the continent

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.316
when I was offered a scholarship
to Boston University for my PhD.

00:01:23.014 --> 00:01:24.928
It is disheartening to see that,

00:01:24.952 --> 00:01:26.619
with all our challenges,

00:01:26.643 --> 00:01:28.024
with all the talents,

00:01:28.048 --> 00:01:30.968
with all the skills we have
in Africa as a continent,

00:01:30.992 --> 00:01:33.206
we tend to solve our problems

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.945
by parachuting in experts
from the West for short stays,

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.373
exporting the best
and brightest out of Africa,

00:01:40.397 --> 00:01:43.618
and treating Africa as a continent
in perpetual need of handouts.

00:01:45.368 --> 00:01:47.710
After my training at Boston University,

00:01:47.734 --> 00:01:48.924
I joined a research team

00:01:48.948 --> 00:01:50.566
at the University of California's

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.788
Institute of the Environment
and Sustainability

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:55.495
because of its reputation
for groundbreaking research

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:57.638
and the development
of policies and programs

00:01:57.662 --> 00:02:00.639
that save the lives
of millions of people the world over,

00:02:00.663 --> 00:02:02.357
including in the developing world.

00:02:02.858 --> 00:02:04.016
And it has been shown

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.401
that for every skilled African
that returns home,

00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:09.425
nine new jobs are created
in the formal and informal sectors.

00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:14.688
So as part of our program, therefore,
to build a sustainable Africa together,

00:02:14.712 --> 00:02:18.926
we are leading a multi-initiative
to develop the Congo Basin Institute,

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.608
a permanent base

00:02:20.632 --> 00:02:24.900
where Africans can work in partnership
with international researchers,

00:02:24.924 --> 00:02:27.692
but working out their own solutions
to their own problems.

00:02:29.042 --> 00:02:33.836
We are using our interdisciplinary
approach to show how universities,

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.471
NGOs and private business

00:02:36.495 --> 00:02:38.558
can partner in international development.

00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:43.869
So instead of parachuting in experts
from the West for short stays,

00:02:43.893 --> 00:02:46.354
we are building a permanent
presence in Africa,

00:02:46.378 --> 00:02:49.988
a one-stop shop for logistics, housing

00:02:50.012 --> 00:02:52.026
and development of collaborative projects

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.272
between Africans
and international researchers.

00:02:54.825 --> 00:02:57.815
So this has allowed students like Michel

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:59.853
to receive high-quality
training in Africa.

00:03:00.588 --> 00:03:03.085
Michel is currently working in our labs

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.348
to investigate the effects
of climate change on insects, for his PhD,

00:03:06.372 --> 00:03:09.284
and has already secured
his post-doctorate fellowship

00:03:09.308 --> 00:03:11.789
that will enable him
to stay on the continent.

00:03:12.605 --> 00:03:15.898
Also through our local help program,

00:03:15.922 --> 00:03:19.057
Dr. Gbenga Abiodun,
a young Nigerian scientist,

00:03:19.081 --> 00:03:21.470
can work as a post-doctoral fellow

00:03:21.494 --> 00:03:23.868
with the Foundation
for Professional Development

00:03:23.892 --> 00:03:26.510
in the University of Western Cape
in South Africa

00:03:26.534 --> 00:03:28.869
and the University of California
at the same time,

00:03:28.893 --> 00:03:32.365
investigating the effects
of climate variability and change

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.425
on malaria transmission in Africa.

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.830
Indeed, Gbenga is currently
developing models

00:03:36.854 --> 00:03:40.116
that will be used
as an early warning system

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.314
to predict malaria transmission in Africa.

00:03:43.603 --> 00:03:47.397
So rather than exporting
our best and brightest out of Africa,

00:03:47.421 --> 00:03:50.503
we are nurturing and supporting
local talent in Africa.

00:03:50.527 --> 00:03:52.475
For example, like me,

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.872
Dr. Eric Fokam was trained in the US.

00:03:56.472 --> 00:03:59.806
He returned home to Cameroon,
but couldn't secure the necessary grants,

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.371
and he found it incredibly challenging

00:04:02.395 --> 00:04:05.879
to practice and learn
the science he knew he could.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.448
So when I met Eric,

00:04:08.472 --> 00:04:10.568
he was on the verge
of returning to the US.

00:04:10.592 --> 00:04:13.052
But we convinced him
to start collaborating

00:04:13.076 --> 00:04:14.928
with the Congo Basin Institute.

00:04:14.952 --> 00:04:19.569
Today, his lab in Buea
has over half a dozen collaborative grants

00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:22.167
with researchers from the US and Europe

00:04:22.191 --> 00:04:25.752
supporting 14 graduate students,
nine of them women,

00:04:25.776 --> 00:04:27.792
all carrying out groundbreaking research

00:04:27.816 --> 00:04:30.221
understanding biodiversity
under climate change,

00:04:30.245 --> 00:04:31.649
human health and nutrition.

00:04:32.367 --> 00:04:38.198
(Applause)

00:04:38.222 --> 00:04:42.540
So rather than buy into the ideas
of Africa taking handouts,

00:04:42.564 --> 00:04:45.436
we are using our
interdisciplinary approach

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.086
to empower Africans
to find their own solutions.

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:52.819
Right now, we are working
with local communities and students,

00:04:52.843 --> 00:04:54.638
a US entrepreneur,

00:04:54.662 --> 00:04:57.304
scientists from the US and Africa

00:04:57.328 --> 00:05:02.161
to find a way to sustainably grow ebony,
the iconic African hardwood.

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.106
Ebonies, like most African hardwood,
are exploited for timber,

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.867
but we know very little
about their ecology,

00:05:09.891 --> 00:05:11.459
what disperses them,

00:05:11.483 --> 00:05:14.792
how they survive in our forest
80 to 200 years.

00:05:16.044 --> 00:05:17.914
This is Arvin,

00:05:17.938 --> 00:05:20.977
a young PhD student working in our labs,

00:05:21.001 --> 00:05:24.589
conducting what is turning out to be
some cutting-edge tissue culture work.

00:05:25.549 --> 00:05:27.510
Arvin is holding in her hands

00:05:27.534 --> 00:05:31.001
the first ebony tree that was produced
entirely from tissues.

00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:33.462
This is unique in Africa.

00:05:33.486 --> 00:05:36.271
We can now show that you can
produce African timber

00:05:36.295 --> 00:05:37.787
from different plant tissues --

00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:39.994
leaves, stems, roots --

00:05:40.018 --> 00:05:42.733
in addition from generating
them from seeds,

00:05:42.757 --> 00:05:44.287
which is a very difficult task.

00:05:45.608 --> 00:05:49.189
(Applause)

00:05:49.213 --> 00:05:51.592
So other students will take
the varieties of ebony

00:05:51.616 --> 00:05:54.205
which Arvin identifies in our lab,

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.301
graft them to produce saplings,

00:05:56.325 --> 00:05:59.261
and work with local communities
to co-produce ebony

00:05:59.285 --> 00:06:02.222
with local fruit tree species
in their various farms

00:06:02.246 --> 00:06:04.381
using our own tree farm approach,

00:06:04.405 --> 00:06:06.555
whereby we invite all the farmers

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:09.404
to choose their own tree species
they want in their farms.

00:06:10.243 --> 00:06:12.159
So in addition to the ebony,

00:06:12.183 --> 00:06:14.508
the species which the farmers
choose themselves

00:06:14.532 --> 00:06:16.887
will be produced
using our modern techniques

00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:19.007
and incorporated into
their land-use systems,

00:06:19.031 --> 00:06:21.356
so that they start benefiting
from these products

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.558
while waiting for the ebony to mature.

00:06:24.736 --> 00:06:27.975
Today we are planting
15,000 ebony trees in Cameroon,

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:29.514
and for the first time,

00:06:29.538 --> 00:06:32.906
ebony won't be harvested
from the middle of a pristine forest.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.187
This is the model
for our African hardwoods,

00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:38.145
and we are extending this
to include sapele and bubinga,

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:39.691
other highly prized hardwoods.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.273
So if these examples existed
when I was 18,

00:06:45.297 --> 00:06:47.586
I would never have left,

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.521
but because of initiatives
by the Congo Basin Institute,

00:06:50.545 --> 00:06:52.459
I am coming back,

00:06:52.483 --> 00:06:53.959
but I'm not coming back alone.

00:06:54.335 --> 00:06:56.809
I'm bringing with me Western scientists,

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.528
entrepreneurs and students,

00:06:58.552 --> 00:07:01.694
the best science from the best
universities in the world,

00:07:01.718 --> 00:07:03.622
to work and to live in Africa.

00:07:04.908 --> 00:07:09.201
But we all need to scale up this local,
powerful and empowering approach.

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:13.868
So far we have half a dozen
universities and NGOs as partners.

00:07:15.366 --> 00:07:17.065
We are planning to build

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:20.185
a green facility that will expand
on our existing laboratory space

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:22.446
and add more housing
and conference facilities

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.684
to promote a long-term
disciplinary approach.

00:07:25.366 --> 00:07:28.629
I want it to offer more opportunities
to young African scholars,

00:07:28.653 --> 00:07:31.248
and would scale it up by leveraging

00:07:31.272 --> 00:07:34.639
the International Institute
of Tropical Agriculture's existing network

00:07:34.663 --> 00:07:37.113
of 17 research stations
across sub-Saharan Africa.

00:07:38.676 --> 00:07:40.414
The tables are starting to turn ...

00:07:41.494 --> 00:07:43.770
and I hope they keep turning,

00:07:43.794 --> 00:07:45.772
to reach several African nations

00:07:45.796 --> 00:07:49.677
like Côte d'Ivoire, Tanzania and Senegal,

00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:52.184
among the top fastest growing economies

00:07:52.208 --> 00:07:56.297
that can attract several opportunities
for private-sector investment.

00:07:59.153 --> 00:08:02.210
We want to give more opportunities
to African scholars,

00:08:02.234 --> 00:08:04.011
and I long to see a day

00:08:04.035 --> 00:08:07.399
when the most intelligent Africans
will stay on this continent

00:08:07.423 --> 00:08:09.869
and receive high-quality education

00:08:09.893 --> 00:08:12.345
through initiatives
like the Congo Basin Institute,

00:08:12.369 --> 00:08:13.719
and when that happens,

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:17.076
Africa will be on the way
to solving Africa's problems.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.857
And in 50 years, I hope
someone will be giving a TED Talk

00:08:20.881 --> 00:08:24.755
on how to stop the brain drain
of Westerners leaving your homes

00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:26.342
to work and live in Africa.

00:08:26.366 --> 00:08:27.367
(Applause)

00:08:27.391 --> 00:08:28.549
Thank you.

00:08:28.573 --> 00:08:34.177
(Applause)
