00:00:13.206 --> 00:00:14.476
Hello.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.706
My name is Herman,

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.831
and I've always been struck
by how the most important, impactful,

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.855
tsunami-like changes
to our culture and our society

00:00:24.879 --> 00:00:26.609
always come from those things

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:29.577
that we least think
are going to have that impact.

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:31.164
I mean, as a computer scientist,

00:00:31.188 --> 00:00:34.752
I remember when Facebook
was just image-sharing in dorm rooms,

00:00:34.776 --> 00:00:36.975
and depending upon who you ask,

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:39.330
it's now involved in toppling elections.

00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:42.887
I remember when cryptocurrency
or automated trading

00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:45.756
were sort of ideas by a few renegades

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.831
in the financial institutions
in the world for automated trading,

00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:50.284
or online, for cryptocurrency,

00:00:50.308 --> 00:00:53.304
and they're now coming to quickly shape
the way that we operate.

00:00:53.328 --> 00:00:55.490
And I think each of you
can recall that moment

00:00:55.514 --> 00:00:59.835
where one of these ideas felt
like some ignorable, derisive thing,

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.740
and suddenly, oh, crap,
the price of Bitcoin is what it is.

00:01:02.764 --> 00:01:05.706
Or, oh, crap, guess who's been elected.

00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:10.578
The reality is that, you know,
from my perspective,

00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:12.903
I think that we're about
to encounter that again.

00:01:12.927 --> 00:01:14.443
And I think one of the biggest,

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:16.903
most impactful changes
in the way we live our lives,

00:01:16.927 --> 00:01:18.244
to the ways we're educated,

00:01:18.268 --> 00:01:20.831
probably even to how we end up
making an income,

00:01:20.855 --> 00:01:22.426
is about to come not from AI,

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.736
not from space travel or biotech --

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.046
these are all very important
future inventions --

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.514
but in the next five years,

00:01:28.538 --> 00:01:30.728
I think it's going to come
from video games.

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.863
So that's a bold claim, OK.

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:38.125
I see some skeptical faces
in the audience.

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:39.332
But if we take a moment

00:01:39.356 --> 00:01:42.895
to try to look at what video games
are already becoming in our lives today,

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:46.339
and what just a little bit
of technological advancement

00:01:46.363 --> 00:01:47.537
is about to create,

00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:49.680
it starts to become
more of an inevitability.

00:01:49.704 --> 00:01:52.228
And I think the possibilities
are quite electrifying.

00:01:52.252 --> 00:01:54.547
So let's just take a moment
to think about scale.

00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:57.372
I mean, there's already
2.6 billion people who play games.

00:01:57.737 --> 00:02:00.888
And the reality is that's a billion more
than five years ago.

00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:02.801
A billion more people in that time.

00:02:02.825 --> 00:02:06.301
No religion, no media,
nothing has spread like that.

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:08.458
And there's likely to be a billion more

00:02:08.482 --> 00:02:11.464
when Africa and India
gain the infrastructure

00:02:11.488 --> 00:02:13.977
to sort of fully realize
the possibilities of gaming.

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:17.634
But what I find really special is --
and this often shocks a lot of people --

00:02:17.658 --> 00:02:21.018
is that the average age of a gamer,
like, have a guess, think about it.

00:02:21.042 --> 00:02:23.564
It's not six, it's not 18, it's not 12.

00:02:24.983 --> 00:02:26.173
It's 34.

00:02:26.197 --> 00:02:27.909
[Average age of an American gamer]

00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:29.123
It's older than me.

00:02:29.577 --> 00:02:30.943
And that tells us something,

00:02:30.967 --> 00:02:33.395
that this isn't entertainment
for children anymore.

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:36.093
This is already a medium
like literature or anything else

00:02:36.117 --> 00:02:38.382
that's becoming a fundamental
part of our lives.

00:02:38.406 --> 00:02:41.287
One stat I like is that people
who generally picked up gaming

00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:42.906
in the last sort of 15, 20 years

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.096
generally don't stop.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.934
Something changed in the way
that this medium is organized.

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:50.090
And more than that,
it's not just play anymore, right?

00:02:50.114 --> 00:02:51.768
You've heard some examples today,

00:02:51.792 --> 00:02:54.506
but people are earning
an income playing games.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.880
And not in the obvious ways.

00:02:55.904 --> 00:02:57.729
Yes, there's e-sports, there's prizes,

00:02:57.753 --> 00:03:00.538
there's the opportunity to make money
in a competitive way.

00:03:00.562 --> 00:03:04.403
But there's also people earning incomes
modding games, building content in them,

00:03:04.427 --> 00:03:05.609
doing art in them.

00:03:05.633 --> 00:03:09.768
I mean, there's something at a scale
akin to the Florentine Renaissance,

00:03:09.792 --> 00:03:12.181
happening on your kid's iPhone
in your living room.

00:03:12.205 --> 00:03:13.738
And it's being ignored.

00:03:14.085 --> 00:03:17.307
Now, what's even more exciting for me
is what's about to happen.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.300
And when you think about gaming,

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:20.911
you're probably already imagining

00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:23.196
that it features these massive,
infinite worlds,

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.371
but the truth is,

00:03:24.395 --> 00:03:26.831
games have been deeply limited
for a very long time

00:03:26.855 --> 00:03:28.808
in a way that kind of we in the industry

00:03:28.832 --> 00:03:31.998
have tried very hard to cover up
with as much trickery as possible.

00:03:32.022 --> 00:03:35.141
The metaphor I like to use,
if you'd let me geek out for a moment,

00:03:35.165 --> 00:03:36.473
is the notion of a theater.

00:03:36.497 --> 00:03:37.649
For the last 10 years,

00:03:37.673 --> 00:03:40.990
games have massively advanced
the visual effects,

00:03:41.014 --> 00:03:43.656
the physical immersion,
the front end of games.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.006
But behind the scenes,

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.014
the actual experiential reality
of a game world

00:03:48.038 --> 00:03:49.910
has remained woefully limited.

00:03:49.934 --> 00:03:51.974
I'll put that in perspective for a moment.

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:53.863
I could leave this theater right now,

00:03:53.887 --> 00:03:57.061
I could do some graffiti,
get in a fight, fall in love.

00:03:57.085 --> 00:03:59.482
I might actually do
all of those things after this,

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:02.196
but the point is that all of that
would have consequence.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.908
It would ripple through reality --

00:04:03.932 --> 00:04:06.416
all of you could interact with that
at the same time.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.630
It would be persistent.

00:04:07.654 --> 00:04:11.180
And those are very important qualities
to what makes the real world real.

00:04:11.204 --> 00:04:12.768
Now, behind the scenes in games,

00:04:12.792 --> 00:04:14.681
we've had a limit for a very long time.

00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:16.506
And the limit is, behind the visuals,

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.467
the actual information being exchanged
between players or entities

00:04:20.491 --> 00:04:21.768
in a single game world

00:04:21.792 --> 00:04:23.753
has been deeply bounded

00:04:23.777 --> 00:04:27.244
by the fact that games
mostly take place on a single server

00:04:27.268 --> 00:04:28.466
or a single machine.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.331
Even The World of Warcraft
is actually thousands of smaller worlds.

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:34.418
When you hear about concerts in Fortnite,

00:04:34.442 --> 00:04:37.367
you're actually hearing
about thousands of small concerts.

00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:39.752
You know, individual,
as was said earlier today,

00:04:39.776 --> 00:04:41.209
campfires or couches.

00:04:41.695 --> 00:04:44.569
There isn't really this possibility
to bring it all together.

00:04:44.593 --> 00:04:47.544
Let's take a moment to just
really understand what that means.

00:04:47.568 --> 00:04:50.536
When you look at a game,
you might see this, beautiful visuals,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.729
all of these things
happening in front of you.

00:04:52.753 --> 00:04:54.698
But behind the scenes in an online game,

00:04:54.722 --> 00:04:56.025
this is what it looks like.

00:04:56.049 --> 00:04:57.232
To a computer scientist,

00:04:57.256 --> 00:04:59.472
all you see is just
a little bit of information

00:04:59.496 --> 00:05:02.755
being exchanged by a tiny handful
of meaningful entities or objects.

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:05.833
You might be thinking,
"I've played in an infinite world."

00:05:05.857 --> 00:05:08.255
Well it's more that you've played
on a treadmill.

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:10.279
As you've been walking through that world,

00:05:10.303 --> 00:05:14.397
we've been cleverly causing the parts
of it that you're not in to vanish,

00:05:14.421 --> 00:05:16.567
and the parts of it
in front of you to appear.

00:05:16.591 --> 00:05:18.958
A good trick, but not the basis
for the revolution

00:05:18.982 --> 00:05:21.341
that I promised you
in the beginning of this talk.

00:05:21.365 --> 00:05:24.374
But the reality is, for those of you
that are passionate gamers

00:05:24.398 --> 00:05:25.940
and might be excited about this,

00:05:25.964 --> 00:05:28.418
and for those of you
that are afraid and may not be,

00:05:28.442 --> 00:05:29.973
all of that is about to change.

00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:32.053
Because finally,
the technology is in place

00:05:32.077 --> 00:05:34.785
to go well beyond the limits
that we've previously seen.

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:36.414
I've dedicated my career to this,

00:05:36.438 --> 00:05:38.636
there are many others
working on the problem --

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.463
I'd hardly take credit for it myself,

00:05:40.487 --> 00:05:42.711
but we're at the point now
where we can finally

00:05:42.735 --> 00:05:44.447
do this impossible hard thing

00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:47.463
of weaving together thousands
of disparate machines

00:05:47.487 --> 00:05:49.164
into single simulations

00:05:49.188 --> 00:05:51.657
that are convenient enough
to not be one-offs,

00:05:51.681 --> 00:05:53.322
but to be buildable by anybody.

00:05:53.346 --> 00:05:54.530
And to be at the point

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:57.904
where we can start to experience
those things that we can't yet fathom.

00:05:57.928 --> 00:06:00.097
Let's just take a moment
to visualize that.

00:06:00.121 --> 00:06:03.003
I'm talking about not individual
little simulations

00:06:03.027 --> 00:06:07.079
but a massive possibility
of huge networks of interaction.

00:06:07.103 --> 00:06:09.452
Massive global events
that can happen inside that.

00:06:09.476 --> 00:06:11.102
Things that even in the real world

00:06:11.126 --> 00:06:13.569
become challenging to produce
at that kind of scale.

00:06:13.593 --> 00:06:15.291
And I know some of you are gamers,

00:06:15.315 --> 00:06:17.840
so I'm going to show you
some footage of some things

00:06:17.864 --> 00:06:21.006
that I'm pretty sure I'm allowed to do,
from some of our partners.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.959
TED and me had a back-and-forth on this.

00:06:22.983 --> 00:06:25.873
These are a few things
that not many people have seen before,

00:06:25.897 --> 00:06:28.581
some new experiences
powered by this type of technology.

00:06:28.605 --> 00:06:31.330
I'll just [take] a moment
to show you some of this stuff.

00:06:31.354 --> 00:06:32.665
This is a single game world

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:36.322
with thousands of simultaneous
people participating in a conflict.

00:06:36.346 --> 00:06:39.426
It also has its own ecosystem,

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.181
its own sense of predator and prey.

00:06:41.205 --> 00:06:44.014
Every single object you see here
is simulated in some way.

00:06:44.038 --> 00:06:47.445
This is a game being built by one
of the biggest companies in the world,

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:49.048
NetEase, a huge Chinese company.

00:06:49.072 --> 00:06:51.421
And they've made
an assistant creative simulation

00:06:51.445 --> 00:06:53.715
where groups of players
can cocreate together,

00:06:53.739 --> 00:06:54.910
across multiple devices,

00:06:54.934 --> 00:06:57.205
in a world that doesn't vanish
when you're done.

00:06:57.229 --> 00:06:59.598
It's a place to tell stories
and have adventures.

00:06:59.622 --> 00:07:01.062
Even the weather is simulated.

00:07:01.086 --> 00:07:02.858
And that's kind of awesome.

00:07:02.882 --> 00:07:04.486
And this is my personal favorite.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.668
This is a group of people,
pioneers in Berlin,

00:07:06.692 --> 00:07:08.001
a group called Klang Games,

00:07:08.025 --> 00:07:11.191
and they're completely insane,
and they'll love me for saying that.

00:07:11.215 --> 00:07:13.977
And they found a way to model,
basically, an entire planet.

00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:17.468
They're going to have a simulation
with millions of non-player characters

00:07:17.492 --> 00:07:18.701
and players engaging.

00:07:18.725 --> 00:07:20.560
They actually grabbed Lawrence Lessig

00:07:20.584 --> 00:07:22.734
to help understand
the political ramifications

00:07:22.758 --> 00:07:24.242
of the world they're creating.

00:07:24.266 --> 00:07:26.632
This is the sort of astounding
set of experiences,

00:07:26.656 --> 00:07:28.624
well beyond what we might have imagined,

00:07:28.648 --> 00:07:30.299
that are now going to be possible.

00:07:30.323 --> 00:07:32.688
And that's just the first step
in this technology.

00:07:32.712 --> 00:07:34.762
So if we step beyond that, what happens?

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.544
Well, computer science
tends to be all exponential,

00:07:38.568 --> 00:07:40.433
once we crack the really hard problems.

00:07:40.457 --> 00:07:42.147
And I'm pretty sure that very soon,

00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:44.378
we're going to be in a place
where we can make

00:07:44.402 --> 00:07:46.783
this type of computational power
look like nothing.

00:07:46.807 --> 00:07:49.887
And when that happens,
the opportunities ...

00:07:49.911 --> 00:07:53.365
It's worth taking a moment to try
to imagine what I'm talking about here.

00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:55.465
Hundreds of thousands
or millions of people

00:07:55.489 --> 00:07:57.355
being able to coinhabit the same space.

00:07:57.379 --> 00:07:59.713
The last time any of us as a species

00:07:59.737 --> 00:08:02.246
had the opportunity
to build or do something together

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.454
with that may people was in antiquity.

00:08:04.478 --> 00:08:07.446
And the circumstances
were less than optimal, shall we say.

00:08:08.064 --> 00:08:10.081
Mostly conflicts or building pyramids.

00:08:10.105 --> 00:08:13.343
Not necessarily the best thing for us
to be spending our time doing.

00:08:13.367 --> 00:08:15.387
But if you bring together
that many people,

00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:18.339
the kind of shared experience
that can create ...

00:08:18.363 --> 00:08:21.204
I think it exercises a social muscle in us

00:08:21.228 --> 00:08:22.871
that we've lost and forgotten.

00:08:22.895 --> 00:08:24.077
Going even beyond that,

00:08:24.101 --> 00:08:26.553
I want to take a moment
to think about what it means

00:08:26.577 --> 00:08:28.112
for relationships, for identity.

00:08:28.136 --> 00:08:31.088
If we can give each other worlds,
experiences at scale

00:08:31.112 --> 00:08:33.522
where we can spend
a meaningful amount of our time,

00:08:33.546 --> 00:08:35.823
we can change what it means
to be an individual.

00:08:35.847 --> 00:08:37.482
We can go beyond a single identity

00:08:37.506 --> 00:08:39.982
to a diverse set of personal identities.

00:08:40.006 --> 00:08:43.783
The gender, the race,
the personality traits you were born with

00:08:43.807 --> 00:08:46.902
might be something you want
to experiment differently with.

00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:49.712
You might be someone
that wants to be more than one person.

00:08:49.736 --> 00:08:51.799
We all are, inside, multiple people.

00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:53.958
We rarely get
the opportunity to flex that.

00:08:53.982 --> 00:08:55.433
It's also about empathy.

00:08:55.457 --> 00:08:56.617
I have a grandmother

00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:58.696
who I have literally
nothing in common with.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.895
I love her to bits,

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:03.897
but every story she has begins in 1940
and ends sometime in 1950.

00:09:03.921 --> 00:09:06.268
And every story I have
is like 50 years later.

00:09:06.292 --> 00:09:07.780
But if we could coinhabit,

00:09:07.804 --> 00:09:09.664
co-experience things together,

00:09:09.688 --> 00:09:12.521
that undiminished by physical frailty
or by lack of context,

00:09:12.545 --> 00:09:14.220
create opportunities together,

00:09:14.244 --> 00:09:17.291
that changes things,
that bonds people in different ways.

00:09:17.315 --> 00:09:21.514
I'm struck by how social media
has amplified our many differences,

00:09:21.538 --> 00:09:24.698
and really made us more who we are
in the presence of other people.

00:09:24.722 --> 00:09:27.174
I think games could really start to create

00:09:27.198 --> 00:09:29.151
an opportunity for us to empathize again.

00:09:29.175 --> 00:09:31.397
To have shared adversity,
shared opportunity.

00:09:31.421 --> 00:09:33.889
I mean, statistically,
at this moment in time,

00:09:33.913 --> 00:09:37.652
there are people who are
on the opposite sides of a conflict,

00:09:37.676 --> 00:09:40.009
who have been matchmade
together into a game

00:09:40.033 --> 00:09:41.802
and don't even know it.

00:09:41.826 --> 00:09:45.097
That's an incredible opportunity
to change the way we look at things.

00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:48.560
Finally, for those of you who perhaps are
more cynical about all of this,

00:09:48.584 --> 00:09:51.977
who maybe don't think that virtual worlds
and games are your cup of tea.

00:09:52.001 --> 00:09:53.786
There's a reality you have to accept,

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.739
and that is that the economic impact
of what I'm talking about

00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:57.921
will be profound.

00:09:57.945 --> 00:10:00.820
Right now, thousands of people
have full-time jobs in gaming.

00:10:00.844 --> 00:10:03.585
Soon, it will be millions of people.

00:10:03.609 --> 00:10:06.149
Wherever there's a mobile phone,
there will be a job.

00:10:06.173 --> 00:10:09.069
An opportunity for something
that is creative and rich

00:10:09.093 --> 00:10:11.823
and gives you an income,
no matter what country you're in,

00:10:11.847 --> 00:10:15.220
no matter what skills or opportunities
you might think you have.

00:10:15.244 --> 00:10:17.887
Probably the first dollar
most kids born today make

00:10:17.911 --> 00:10:19.093
might be in a game.

00:10:19.117 --> 00:10:20.728
That will be the new paper route,

00:10:20.752 --> 00:10:22.927
that will be the new
opportunity for an income

00:10:22.951 --> 00:10:24.574
at the earliest time in your life.

00:10:24.598 --> 00:10:28.462
So I kind of want to end
with almost a plea,

00:10:28.486 --> 00:10:30.438
really, more than thoughts.

00:10:30.836 --> 00:10:33.711
A sense of, I think, how we need
to face this new opportunity

00:10:33.735 --> 00:10:36.078
a little differently
to some we have in the past.

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:38.434
It's so hypocritical
for yet another technologist

00:10:38.458 --> 00:10:39.864
to stand up on stage and say,

00:10:39.888 --> 00:10:42.281
"The future will be great,
technology will fix it."

00:10:42.305 --> 00:10:44.804
And the reality is,
this is going to have downsides.

00:10:44.828 --> 00:10:46.974
But those downsides will only be amplified

00:10:46.998 --> 00:10:50.371
if we approach, once again,
with cynicism and derision,

00:10:50.395 --> 00:10:52.228
the opportunities that this presents.

00:10:52.252 --> 00:10:54.299
The worst thing that we could possibly do

00:10:54.323 --> 00:10:56.318
is let the same four or five companies

00:10:56.342 --> 00:10:59.339
end up dominating
yet another adjacent space.

00:10:59.363 --> 00:11:01.728
(Applause)

00:11:01.752 --> 00:11:05.918
Because they're not just going to define
how and who makes money from this.

00:11:05.942 --> 00:11:09.878
The reality is, we're now talking
about defining how we think,

00:11:09.902 --> 00:11:12.498
what the rules are
around identity and collaboration,

00:11:12.522 --> 00:11:14.196
the rules of the world we live in.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.156
This has got to be something we all own,

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.330
we all cocreate.

00:11:17.807 --> 00:11:20.799
So, my final plea
is really to those engineers,

00:11:20.823 --> 00:11:24.061
those scientists, those artists
in the audience today.

00:11:24.085 --> 00:11:27.156
Maybe some of you dreamed
of working on space travel.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.672
The reality is, there are worlds
you can build right here, right now,

00:11:30.696 --> 00:11:32.672
that can transform people's lives.

00:11:32.696 --> 00:11:35.379
There are still huge
technological frontiers

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:36.847
that need to be overcome here,

00:11:36.871 --> 00:11:39.506
akin to those we faced
when building the early internet.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.101
All the technology
behind virtual worlds is different.

00:11:42.125 --> 00:11:43.737
So, my plea to you is this.

00:11:43.761 --> 00:11:45.904
Let's engage, let's all engage,

00:11:45.928 --> 00:11:49.754
let's actually try to make this something
that we shape in a positive way,

00:11:49.778 --> 00:11:52.793
rather than once again have be done to us.

00:11:52.817 --> 00:11:53.968
Thank you.

00:11:53.992 --> 00:11:59.150
(Applause)
