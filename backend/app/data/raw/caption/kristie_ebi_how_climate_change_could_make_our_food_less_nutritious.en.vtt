00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.696
Yogi Berra, a US baseball player
and philosopher, said,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.287
"If we don't know where we're going,
we might not get there."

00:00:23.525 --> 00:00:27.571
Accumulating scientific knowledge
is giving us greater insights,

00:00:27.595 --> 00:00:32.767
greater clarity, into what our future
might look like in a changing climate

00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:35.000
and what that could mean for our health.

00:00:35.714 --> 00:00:39.419
I'm here to talk about a related aspect,

00:00:39.443 --> 00:00:44.105
on how our emissions of greenhouse gases
from burning of fossil fuels

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.159
is reducing the nutritional
quality of our food.

00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:51.150
We'll start with the food pyramid.

00:00:51.174 --> 00:00:52.936
You all know the food pyramid.

00:00:53.348 --> 00:00:55.786
We all need to eat a balanced diet.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.327
We need to get proteins,

00:00:57.351 --> 00:00:59.062
we need to get micronutrients,

00:00:59.086 --> 00:01:00.394
we need to get vitamins.

00:01:00.418 --> 00:01:03.148
And so, this is a way
for us to think about

00:01:03.172 --> 00:01:06.166
how to make sure we get
what we need every day

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.308
so we can grow and thrive.

00:01:08.332 --> 00:01:10.917
But we eat not just because we need to,

00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:12.881
we also eat for enjoyment.

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:15.508
Bread, pasta, pizza --

00:01:15.532 --> 00:01:19.613
there's a whole range of foods
that are culturally important.

00:01:19.637 --> 00:01:21.429
We enjoy eating these.

00:01:22.088 --> 00:01:24.479
And so they're important for our diet,

00:01:24.503 --> 00:01:27.173
but they're also important
for our cultures.

00:01:27.757 --> 00:01:33.261
Carbon dioxide has been increasing since
the start of the Industrial Revolution,

00:01:33.285 --> 00:01:38.647
increasing from about
280 parts per million to over 410 today,

00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:40.914
and it continues to increase.

00:01:40.938 --> 00:01:45.364
The carbon that plants need to grow
comes from this carbon dioxide.

00:01:45.388 --> 00:01:46.850
They bring it into the plant,

00:01:46.874 --> 00:01:50.121
they break it apart
into the carbon itself,

00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:51.929
and they use that to grow.

00:01:52.542 --> 00:01:55.475
They also need nutrients from the soil.

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:59.672
And so yes, carbon dioxide is plant food.

00:02:01.186 --> 00:02:06.152
And this should be good news,
of rising carbon dioxide concentrations,

00:02:06.176 --> 00:02:09.132
for food security around the world,

00:02:09.156 --> 00:02:12.814
making sure that people
get enough to eat every day.

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:18.621
About 820 million people in the world
don't get enough to eat every day.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.692
So there's a fair amount written
about how higher CO2

00:02:22.716 --> 00:02:25.487
is going to help with
our food security problem.

00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:30.593
We need to accelerate our progress
in agricultural productivity

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:35.452
to feed the nine to 10 billion people
who will be alive in 2050

00:02:35.476 --> 00:02:37.997
and to achieve the Sustainable
Development Goals,

00:02:38.021 --> 00:02:39.759
particularly the Goal Number 2,

00:02:39.783 --> 00:02:42.939
that is on reducing food insecurity,

00:02:42.963 --> 00:02:44.487
increasing nutrition,

00:02:44.511 --> 00:02:48.171
increasing access to the foods
that we need for everyone.

00:02:48.195 --> 00:02:52.935
We know that climate change
is affecting agricultural productivity.

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.365
The earth has warmed
about one degree centigrade

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.680
since preindustrial times.

00:02:57.704 --> 00:03:01.513
That is changing local temperature
and precipitation patterns,

00:03:01.537 --> 00:03:05.971
and that has consequences
for the agricultural productivity

00:03:05.995 --> 00:03:07.617
in many parts of the world.

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:11.583
And it's not just local changes
in temperature and precipitation,

00:03:11.607 --> 00:03:12.833
it's the extremes.

00:03:13.553 --> 00:03:17.224
Extremes in terms of heat waves,
floods and droughts

00:03:17.248 --> 00:03:21.018
are significantly affecting productivity.

00:03:22.677 --> 00:03:25.013
And that carbon dioxide,

00:03:25.037 --> 00:03:27.994
besides making plants grow,

00:03:28.018 --> 00:03:30.795
has other consequences as well,

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.885
that plants, when they have
higher carbon dioxide,

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.954
increase the synthesis of carbohydrates,
sugars and starches,

00:03:37.978 --> 00:03:43.238
and they decrease the concentrations
of protein and critical nutrients.

00:03:43.262 --> 00:03:49.775
And this is very important for how we
think about food security going forward.

00:03:50.532 --> 00:03:54.438
A couple of nights ago
in the table talks on climate change,

00:03:54.462 --> 00:03:58.427
someone said that they're
a five-sevenths optimist:

00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:01.282
that they're an optimist
five days of the week,

00:04:01.306 --> 00:04:04.021
and this is a topic
for the other two days.

00:04:05.227 --> 00:04:07.386
When we think about micronutrients,

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.827
almost all of them are affected
by higher CO2 concentrations.

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:14.260
Two in particular are iron and zinc.

00:04:14.284 --> 00:04:18.291
When you don't have enough iron,
you can develop iron deficiency anemia.

00:04:18.315 --> 00:04:21.369
It's associated with fatigue,
shortness of breath

00:04:21.393 --> 00:04:24.726
and some fairly serious
consequences as well.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.466
When you don't have enough zinc,

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.021
you can have a loss of appetite.

00:04:29.045 --> 00:04:31.172
It is a significant
problem around the world.

00:04:31.196 --> 00:04:34.271
There's about one billion people
who are zinc deficient.

00:04:34.295 --> 00:04:37.235
It's very important
for maternal and child health.

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.166
It affects development.

00:04:39.788 --> 00:04:43.605
The B vitamins are critical
for a whole range of reasons.

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:46.623
They help convert our food into energy.

00:04:46.647 --> 00:04:48.365
They're important for the functions

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.960
of many of the physiologic
activities in our bodies.

00:04:51.984 --> 00:04:54.688
And when you have
higher carbon in a plant,

00:04:54.712 --> 00:04:56.370
you have less nitrogen,

00:04:56.394 --> 00:04:58.310
and you have less B vitamins.

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:00.295
And it's not just us.

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:02.058
Cattle are already being affected

00:05:02.082 --> 00:05:05.704
because the quality
of their forage is declining.

00:05:05.728 --> 00:05:09.189
In fact, this affects
every consumer of plants.

00:05:09.213 --> 00:05:13.085
And give a thought to, for example,
our pet cats and dogs.

00:05:13.109 --> 00:05:16.577
If you look on the label
of most of the pet and dog food,

00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:21.246
there's a significant amount
of grain in those foods.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.357
So this affects everyone.

00:05:23.381 --> 00:05:25.687
How do we know that this is a problem?

00:05:25.711 --> 00:05:27.588
We know from field studies

00:05:27.612 --> 00:05:30.943
and we know from experimental
studies in laboratories.

00:05:30.967 --> 00:05:32.447
In the field studies --

00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:36.916
and I'll focus primarily
on wheat and on rice --

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.346
there's fields, for example, of rice

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.460
that are divided into different plots.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.564
And the plots are all the same:

00:05:44.588 --> 00:05:46.459
the soil's the same,

00:05:46.483 --> 00:05:48.192
the precipitation's the same --

00:05:48.216 --> 00:05:50.152
everything's the same.

00:05:50.176 --> 00:05:54.193
Except carbon dioxide
is blown over some of the plots.

00:05:54.637 --> 00:05:57.058
And so you can compare

00:05:57.082 --> 00:06:00.352
what it looks like
under today's conditions

00:06:00.376 --> 00:06:04.563
and under carbon dioxide conditions
later in the century.

00:06:05.032 --> 00:06:08.097
I was part of one of the few studies
that have done this.

00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:12.692
We looked at 18 rice lines
in China and in Japan

00:06:12.716 --> 00:06:15.538
and grew them under conditions
that you would expect

00:06:15.562 --> 00:06:17.185
later in the century.

00:06:19.185 --> 00:06:21.233
And when you look at the results,

00:06:21.257 --> 00:06:24.349
the white bar is today's conditions,

00:06:24.373 --> 00:06:28.409
the red bar is conditions
later in the century.

00:06:28.741 --> 00:06:32.735
So protein declines about 10 percent,

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:36.602
iron about eight percent,
zinc about five percent.

00:06:37.404 --> 00:06:39.950
These don't sound like really big changes,

00:06:39.974 --> 00:06:43.878
but when you start thinking
about the poor in every country

00:06:43.902 --> 00:06:46.347
who primarily eat starch,

00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:49.297
that this will put people
who are on the edge

00:06:49.321 --> 00:06:51.558
over the edge into frank deficiencies,

00:06:51.582 --> 00:06:54.239
creating all kinds of health problems.

00:06:54.263 --> 00:06:58.124
The situation is more significant
for the B vitamins.

00:06:58.148 --> 00:07:01.777
When you look at
vitamin B1 and vitamin B2,

00:07:01.801 --> 00:07:04.470
there's about a 17 percent decline.

00:07:04.494 --> 00:07:09.513
Pantothenic acid, vitamin B5,
is about a 13 percent decline.

00:07:09.537 --> 00:07:12.864
Folate is about a 30 percent decline.

00:07:12.888 --> 00:07:17.162
And these are averages over
the various experiments that were done.

00:07:17.186 --> 00:07:20.758
Folate is critical for child development.

00:07:20.782 --> 00:07:22.891
Pregnant women who don't get enough folate

00:07:22.915 --> 00:07:26.091
are at much higher risk
of having babies with birth defects.

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:31.845
So these are very serious
potential consequences for our health

00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:34.190
as CO2 continues to rise.

00:07:35.636 --> 00:07:36.917
In another example,

00:07:36.941 --> 00:07:41.316
this is modeling work that was done
by Chris Weyant and his colleagues,

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.972
taking a look at this chain
from higher CO2 to lower iron and zinc --

00:07:45.996 --> 00:07:48.428
and they only looked at iron and zinc --

00:07:48.452 --> 00:07:50.409
to various health outcomes.

00:07:50.433 --> 00:07:53.771
They looked at malaria,
diarrheal disease, pneumonia,

00:07:53.795 --> 00:07:55.559
iron deficiency anemia,

00:07:55.583 --> 00:07:59.730
and looked at what
the consequences could be in 2050.

00:07:59.754 --> 00:08:01.974
And the darker the color in this,

00:08:01.998 --> 00:08:03.958
the larger the consequences.

00:08:03.982 --> 00:08:06.681
So you can see the major impacts

00:08:06.705 --> 00:08:09.614
in Asia and in Africa,

00:08:09.638 --> 00:08:12.503
but also note that in countries
such as the United States

00:08:12.527 --> 00:08:14.033
and countries in Europe,

00:08:14.057 --> 00:08:16.472
the populations also could be affected.

00:08:17.075 --> 00:08:21.349
They estimated about
125 million people could be affected.

00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:26.088
They also modeled what would be
the most effective interventions,

00:08:26.112 --> 00:08:30.617
and their conclusion was
reducing our greenhouse gases:

00:08:30.641 --> 00:08:33.719
getting our greenhouse gas emissions
down by mid-century

00:08:33.743 --> 00:08:37.046
so we don't have to worry so much
about these consequences

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.584
later in the century.

00:08:40.568 --> 00:08:43.074
These experiments, these modeling studies

00:08:43.098 --> 00:08:45.656
did not take climate change
itself into account.

00:08:46.082 --> 00:08:49.206
They just focused on
the carbon dioxide component.

00:08:49.584 --> 00:08:51.714
So when you put the two together,

00:08:51.738 --> 00:08:55.197
it's expected the impact is much larger
than what I've told you.

00:08:56.108 --> 00:08:59.127
I'd love to be able to tell you right now

00:08:59.151 --> 00:09:03.965
how much the food you had for breakfast,
the food you're going to have for lunch,

00:09:03.989 --> 00:09:06.868
has shifted from what
your grandparents ate

00:09:06.892 --> 00:09:09.236
in terms of its nutritional quality.

00:09:10.312 --> 00:09:11.469
But I can't.

00:09:11.493 --> 00:09:13.506
We don't have the research on that.

00:09:14.253 --> 00:09:17.404
I'd love to tell you how much
current food insecurity

00:09:17.428 --> 00:09:19.161
is affected by these changes.

00:09:19.851 --> 00:09:21.097
But I can't.

00:09:21.121 --> 00:09:23.430
We don't have the research
on that, either.

00:09:24.437 --> 00:09:27.879
There's a lot that needs
to be known in this area,

00:09:27.903 --> 00:09:31.962
including what the possible
solutions could be.

00:09:31.986 --> 00:09:34.740
We don't know exactly
what those solutions are,

00:09:34.764 --> 00:09:37.497
but we've got a range of options.

00:09:37.521 --> 00:09:40.032
We've got advancements in technologies.

00:09:40.056 --> 00:09:43.412
We've got plant breeding.
We've got biofortification.

00:09:43.436 --> 00:09:45.238
Soils could make a difference.

00:09:45.262 --> 00:09:48.255
And, of course, it will be
very helpful to know

00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:51.760
how these changes could affect
our future health

00:09:51.784 --> 00:09:55.119
and the health of our children
and the health of our grandchildren.

00:09:56.111 --> 00:09:58.474
And these investments take time.

00:09:59.053 --> 00:10:02.237
It will take time to sort
all of these issues out.

00:10:03.427 --> 00:10:07.074
There is no national entity
or business group

00:10:07.098 --> 00:10:08.952
that is funding this research.

00:10:09.799 --> 00:10:15.249
We need these investments critically
so that we do know where we're going.

00:10:16.048 --> 00:10:18.657
In the meantime, what we can do

00:10:18.681 --> 00:10:24.849
is ensure that all people
have access to a complete diet,

00:10:24.873 --> 00:10:28.902
not just those in the wealthy parts
of the world but everywhere in the world.

00:10:29.552 --> 00:10:34.371
We also individually and collectively need
to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions

00:10:34.395 --> 00:10:37.643
to reduce the challenges
that will come later in the century.

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:45.175
It's been said that if you think
education is expensive, try ignorance.

00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:47.331
Let's not.

00:10:47.977 --> 00:10:50.763
Let's invest in ourselves,

00:10:50.787 --> 00:10:51.945
in our children
