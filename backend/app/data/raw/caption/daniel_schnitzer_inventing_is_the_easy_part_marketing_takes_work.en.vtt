00:00:10.225 --> 00:00:12.708
So, without romanticizing this too much,

00:00:12.708 --> 00:00:14.495
imagine that you light your home with

00:00:14.495 --> 00:00:16.237
kerosene and candles every night

00:00:16.237 --> 00:00:19.145
and that you do all of your cooking with charcoal.

00:00:19.145 --> 00:00:22.452
This is how the world's 2 billion poorest people

00:00:22.452 --> 00:00:24.380
cook and light their homes every day.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.605
This isn't just inconvenient,

00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:29.313
this is inefficient, it's expensive,

00:00:29.313 --> 00:00:31.806
it's harmful to human health, to the environment,

00:00:31.806 --> 00:00:34.765
and it's unproductive. And that's energy poverty.

00:00:34.765 --> 00:00:36.520
So let me give you a couple of examples:

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.919
I worked in Haiti where about

00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:42.057
80% of the population lives in energy poverty.

00:00:42.057 --> 00:00:45.887
The average household spends 10% of its income

00:00:45.887 --> 00:00:48.298
on kerosene for lighting – that's an order

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.544
of magnitude greater than what the average

00:00:50.544 --> 00:00:56.049
US household spends on electricity to light their homes.

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:58.012
The 2008 hurricane season in Haiti caused about

00:00:58.012 --> 00:01:02.981
1 billion dollars in damage, that was a sixth of their GDP.

00:01:02.981 --> 00:01:05.326
The damage was so severe because the primary

00:01:05.326 --> 00:01:07.686
energy fuel in Haiti is charcoal, which is made from trees,

00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:09.317
which is made from trees,

00:01:09.317 --> 00:01:12.217
and it's left the country almost completely deforested.

00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:13.976
Without trees, the country can't absorb

00:01:13.976 --> 00:01:17.554
heavy rains and massive flooding, as a result.

00:01:17.554 --> 00:01:19.059
So in the industrialized world,

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:23.326
we build walls to protect us from the externalities of our energy use,

00:01:23.326 --> 00:01:27.488
we can afford to clean up acute environmental disasters

00:01:27.488 --> 00:01:29.564
and we can also afford to adapt

00:01:29.564 --> 00:01:32.004
to chronic conditions like climate change.

00:01:32.004 --> 00:01:35.017
That's not the case for Haiti, they can't afford this.

00:01:35.017 --> 00:01:37.639
The only way that they're going to let themselves out of energy poverty

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:40.488
is by adopting fuels that are more efficient,

00:01:40.488 --> 00:01:42.291
that are less expensive,

00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:44.019
that are better for human health,

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:46.243
that are better for the environment, and that are more productive.

00:01:46.243 --> 00:01:49.040
So it turns out that those fuels and technologies exist,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.084
and this is an example of that:

00:01:51.084 --> 00:01:54.051
this is a solar LED light bulb that we sell

00:01:54.051 --> 00:01:59.032
for a retail price of about 10 dollars in rural Haiti.

00:01:59.032 --> 00:02:01.726
That's a payback period of less than 3 months

00:02:01.726 --> 00:02:04.023
for the average Haitian household.

00:02:05.685 --> 00:02:08.022
The prescriptions to solve energy poverty

00:02:08.022 --> 00:02:11.652
seems pretty straightforward -- you develop these technologies,

00:02:11.652 --> 00:02:13.132
that have a great return on investment,

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:15.263
and people should be snatching them up.

00:02:15.263 --> 00:02:16.643
But that's not the case.

00:02:16.643 --> 00:02:18.578
The first time I ever went down to Haiti

00:02:18.578 --> 00:02:20.805
was in August 2008, sort of on a whim,

00:02:20.805 --> 00:02:22.664
and I was fielding surveys in the rural

00:02:22.664 --> 00:02:26.130
south of the country to assess the extent of energy poverty.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.050
And at night I would go around sometimes

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.009
and I would speak with the street vendors

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:34.142
and see if they were interested in buying these solar LED lamps.

00:02:34.142 --> 00:02:36.506
And so one woman who I encountered turned down

00:02:36.506 --> 00:02:39.583
my offer, and she said, “Mon chéri, c'est trop cher.”

00:02:39.583 --> 00:02:42.294
Which basically means, “My dear, it's too expensive.”

00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:44.010
But I tried to explain to her, you know:

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.510
“Look, this is going to save you a lot

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.867
of money, and it's going to give you

00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:50.243
even better light than what you're using now with the kerosene.”

00:02:50.243 --> 00:02:52.017
So I didn't make the sale,

00:02:52.017 --> 00:02:54.054
but I did learn a really important lesson

00:02:54.054 --> 00:02:56.037
which is that technology, products

00:02:56.037 --> 00:02:59.027
were not going to end energy poverty.

00:02:59.027 --> 00:03:01.042
Instead access was going to,

00:03:01.042 --> 00:03:03.981
and specifically there are 2 types of access

00:03:03.981 --> 00:03:06.008
that are going to end energy poverty:

00:03:06.008 --> 00:03:09.190
there's physical access, and there is financial access.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.084
So, physical access -- what does that mean?

00:03:12.084 --> 00:03:16.034
It's very expensive for low-income households

00:03:16.034 --> 00:03:17.684
in developing countries to reach major

00:03:17.684 --> 00:03:20.022
centers of commerce, and it's basically impossible

00:03:20.022 --> 00:03:23.027
for them to order something off amazon.com

00:03:23.027 --> 00:03:25.602
“the last mile” is a phrase that is normally associated

00:03:25.602 --> 00:03:27.467
with the telecommunications industry,

00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:29.324
it means that last bit of wire that's necessary

00:03:29.324 --> 00:03:31.957
to connect the customer to the provider.

00:03:31.957 --> 00:03:35.042
What we need for ending energy poverty

00:03:35.042 --> 00:03:38.002
are “last mile retailers” that bring these

00:03:38.002 --> 00:03:40.984
clean energy products to the people.

00:03:40.984 --> 00:03:44.143
The kerosene and charcoal value chains already figured this out:

00:03:44.143 --> 00:03:47.065
those fuels are ubiquitous across the entire country.

00:03:47.065 --> 00:03:50.036
You can go to the most remote village in Haiti

00:03:50.036 --> 00:03:53.545
and you will find somebody selling kerosene and charcoal.

00:03:53.545 --> 00:03:56.007
So the other type of access: financial.

00:03:56.007 --> 00:03:58.302
We all know that clean energy products,

00:03:58.302 --> 00:04:00.649
technologies, tend to be characterized

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:03.671
by a higher upfront costs, but very low operating costs.

00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:05.495
And so in the industrialized world,

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:07.035
we have very generous subsidies that are

00:04:07.035 --> 00:04:11.133
specifically designed to bring down those upfront costs.

00:04:11.133 --> 00:04:13.052
Those subsidies don't exist in Haiti.

00:04:13.052 --> 00:04:16.012
What they do have is micro-finance,

00:04:16.012 --> 00:04:17.520
but you're going to severely diminish

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.404
the value proposition of your clean energy product

00:04:19.404 --> 00:04:21.374
if you expect somebody in Haiti

00:04:21.374 --> 00:04:24.092
to go out, get a micro-loan, go back to the retailer,

00:04:24.092 --> 00:04:28.020
and then buy the clean energy product.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.069
So the prescription to end energy poverty

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.041
is much more complicated than simply products.

00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:36.031
We need to integrate financial access

00:04:36.031 --> 00:04:40.091
directly into new, innovative, distribution models.

00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:42.040
What does that mean?

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.271
That means bundling consumer credit with the retailer.

00:04:45.271 --> 00:04:48.044
This is really easy for Bloomingdale’s to do,

00:04:48.044 --> 00:04:52.033
but it's not so easy for a rural sales-agent in Haiti to do.

00:04:52.033 --> 00:04:55.003
We need to redirect cash flows that

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:57.981
are going now from the diaspora in the US

00:04:57.981 --> 00:05:01.271
to Western Union wire transfers in cash

00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:03.535
directly into clean energy products

00:05:03.535 --> 00:05:07.088
that can be delivered to, or picked up, by their friends or family in Haiti.

00:05:07.088 --> 00:05:11.321
So the next time you hear about a technology or product that's going

00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:12.849
to change the world, be a little bit skeptical.

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.811
The inventor Dean Kamen, the guy who invented the Segway,

00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:22.117
a genius by any standards, once said that his job is easy,

00:05:22.117 --> 00:05:24.010
inventing things is easy,

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.218
the hard part is technology dissemination

00:05:27.218 --> 00:05:30.159
-- it's getting those technologies and products to the people who need it most.

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:31.814
Thank you.

00:05:31.814 --> 00:05:35.166
(Applause)
