00:00:14.801 --> 00:00:17.618
Chris Anderson: So two months ago,
something crazy happened.

00:00:17.643 --> 00:00:21.269
Can you talk us through this, because
this caught so many people's attention?

00:00:21.294 --> 00:00:23.682
Gwynne Shotwell: I'll stay quiet
for the beginning,

00:00:23.707 --> 00:00:25.048
and then I'll start talking.

00:00:25.073 --> 00:00:29.412
(Video) Voices: Five, four,
three, two, one.

00:00:29.436 --> 00:00:31.556
(Cheering)

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.316
Woman: Liftoff. Go Falcon Heavy.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.192
GS: So this was such
an important moment for SpaceX.

00:00:38.216 --> 00:00:40.972
With the Falcon 9
and now the Falcon Heavy,

00:00:40.996 --> 00:00:43.711
we can launch into orbit

00:00:43.735 --> 00:00:48.607
any payload that has previously
been conceived or is conceived right now.

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:51.584
We've got a couple of launches
of Falcon Heavy later this year,

00:00:51.608 --> 00:00:53.264
so this had to go right.

00:00:53.288 --> 00:00:55.646
It was the first time we flew it,

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.469
and the star of the show, of course,

00:00:57.493 --> 00:01:00.017
brother and sister side boosters landing.

00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:01.192
I was excited.

00:01:01.216 --> 00:01:02.819
(Laughter)

00:01:02.843 --> 00:01:03.994
Thanking my team.

00:01:04.018 --> 00:01:06.066
By the way, there's maybe
a thousand people

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.709
standing around me right there.

00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:09.832
And Starman.

00:01:10.357 --> 00:01:12.310
Starman did not steal the show, though --

00:01:12.334 --> 00:01:13.580
the boosters did.

00:01:13.604 --> 00:01:14.615
CA: (Laughter)

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:17.956
CA: There had to be some payload --
why not put a Tesla into space?

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.933
GS: Exactly. It was perfect.

00:01:19.957 --> 00:01:22.422
CA: Gwynne, let's wind the clock back.

00:01:22.446 --> 00:01:26.790
I mean, how did you end up an engineer
and President of SpaceX?

00:01:26.814 --> 00:01:29.083
Were you supernerdy as a girl?

00:01:29.107 --> 00:01:30.605
GS: I don't think I was nerdy,

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:33.945
but I was definitely doing the things
that the girls weren't doing.

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:36.981
I asked my mom, who was an artist,
when I was in third grade,

00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:38.246
how a car worked,

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.960
so she had no idea so she gave me
a book, and I read it,

00:01:41.984 --> 00:01:46.157
and sure enough, my first job
out of my mechanical engineering degree

00:01:46.181 --> 00:01:49.653
was with Chrysler Motors
in the automotive industry.

00:01:49.677 --> 00:01:52.563
But I actually got into engineering
not because of that book

00:01:52.587 --> 00:01:55.671
but because my mom took me
to a Society of Women Engineers event,

00:01:55.695 --> 00:01:58.476
and I fell in love with
the mechanical engineer that spoke.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.293
She was doing really critical work,

00:02:00.317 --> 00:02:02.359
and I loved her suit.

00:02:02.383 --> 00:02:03.384
(Laughter)

00:02:03.408 --> 00:02:05.717
And that's what a 15-year-old
girl connects with.

00:02:05.741 --> 00:02:08.215
And I used to shy away
from telling that story,

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.525
but if that's what caused me
to be an engineer --

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.407
hey, I think we should talk about that.

00:02:12.431 --> 00:02:18.307
CA: Sixteen years ago, you became
employee number seven at SpaceX,

00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:20.133
and then over the next years,

00:02:20.157 --> 00:02:25.509
you somehow built a multi-billion-dollar
relationship with NASA,

00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:29.358
despite the fact that SpaceX's
first three launches blew up.

00:02:29.382 --> 00:02:31.258
I mean, how on earth did you do that?

00:02:31.282 --> 00:02:35.162
GS: So actually, selling rockets
is all about relationships

00:02:35.186 --> 00:02:37.820
and making a connection
with these customers.

00:02:37.844 --> 00:02:39.661
When you don't have a rocket to sell,

00:02:39.685 --> 00:02:41.811
what's really important
is selling your team,

00:02:41.835 --> 00:02:44.003
selling the business savvy of your CEO --

00:02:44.027 --> 00:02:46.393
that's not really hard
to sell these days --

00:02:46.417 --> 00:02:49.681
and basically, making sure
that any technical issue that they have

00:02:49.705 --> 00:02:51.824
or any concern,
you can address right away.

00:02:51.848 --> 00:02:55.260
So I think it was helpful
for me to be an engineer.

00:02:55.284 --> 00:02:58.855
I think it was helpful to my role
of running sales for Elon.

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.284
CA: And currently,
a big focus of the company

00:03:01.308 --> 00:03:03.543
is, I guess, kind of a race with Boeing

00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:06.884
to be the first to provide
the service to NASA

00:03:06.908 --> 00:03:11.186
of actually putting humans into orbit.

00:03:12.702 --> 00:03:15.935
Safety considerations obviously
come to the fore, here.

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.482
How are you sleeping?

00:03:18.506 --> 00:03:22.479
GS: I actually sleep really well.
I'm a good sleeper, that's my best thing.

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:26.740
But I think the days leading up
to our flying crew

00:03:26.764 --> 00:03:28.676
will probably be a little sleepless.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.076
But really, fundamentally,
safety comes in the design

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.386
of the system that you're going
to fly people on,

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.349
and so we've been working for years,

00:03:36.373 --> 00:03:38.758
actually, almost a decade,
on this technology.

00:03:38.782 --> 00:03:41.014
We're taking the Dragon cargo spaceship

00:03:41.038 --> 00:03:43.776
and we're upgrading it
to be able to carry crew.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.823
And as I said, we've been
engineering in these safety systems

00:03:47.847 --> 00:03:49.435
for quite some time.

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.815
CA: So isn't it that there's one system
that actually allows instant escape

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:55.021
if there's a problem.

00:03:55.045 --> 00:03:57.657
GS: That's right. It's called
the launch escape system.

00:03:57.681 --> 00:03:59.681
CA: I think we have that. Let's show that.

00:03:59.705 --> 00:04:02.156
GS: We've got a video
of a test that we ran in 2015.

00:04:03.062 --> 00:04:07.168
So this simulated having
a really bad day on the pad.

00:04:07.192 --> 00:04:09.891
Basically, you want the capsule
to get out of Dodge.

00:04:09.915 --> 00:04:11.923
You want it to get away from the rocket

00:04:11.947 --> 00:04:14.700
that had a bad day right below it.

00:04:14.724 --> 00:04:16.752
This is if there was an issue on the pad.

00:04:16.776 --> 00:04:19.538
We also will be doing
another demonstration later this year

00:04:19.562 --> 00:04:22.681
on if we have an issue
with the rocket during flight.

00:04:23.228 --> 00:04:27.411
CA: And those rockets have another
potential function as well, eventually.

00:04:27.435 --> 00:04:30.742
GS: Yeah, so the launch escape system
for Dragon is pretty unique.

00:04:30.766 --> 00:04:32.671
It's an integrated launch escape system.

00:04:32.695 --> 00:04:33.973
It's basically a pusher,

00:04:33.997 --> 00:04:38.333
so the propellant system and the thrusters
are integrated into the capsule,

00:04:38.357 --> 00:04:42.464
and so if it detects a rocket problem,
it pushes the capsule away.

00:04:42.488 --> 00:04:46.289
Capsule safety systems in the past
have been like tractor pullers,

00:04:46.313 --> 00:04:48.289
and the reason we didn't want to do that

00:04:48.313 --> 00:04:51.964
is that puller needs to come off before
you can safely reenter that capsule,

00:04:51.988 --> 00:04:56.461
so we wanted to eliminate, in design,
that possibility of failure.

00:04:57.084 --> 00:05:01.513
CA: I mean, SpaceX has made
the regular reusability of rockets

00:05:01.537 --> 00:05:03.702
seem almost routine,

00:05:03.726 --> 00:05:05.378
which means you've done something

00:05:05.402 --> 00:05:08.062
that no national
space program, for example,

00:05:08.086 --> 00:05:10.098
has been able to achieve.

00:05:10.122 --> 00:05:11.756
How was that possible?

00:05:12.423 --> 00:05:15.129
GS: I think there's a couple of things --

00:05:15.153 --> 00:05:17.216
there's a million things, actually --

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.160
that have allowed SpaceX to be successful.

00:05:20.184 --> 00:05:23.826
The first is that we're kind of standing
on the shoulders of giants. Right?

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.406
We got to look at the rocket industry
and the developments to date,

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.857
and we got to pick the best ideas,

00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:32.688
leverage them.

00:05:32.712 --> 00:05:36.739
We also didn't have technology
that we had to include

00:05:36.763 --> 00:05:38.179
in our vehicle systems.

00:05:38.203 --> 00:05:42.035
So we didn't have to design
around legacy components

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:45.250
that maybe weren't the most reliable
or were particularly expensive,

00:05:45.274 --> 00:05:49.334
so we really were able to let physics
drive the design of these systems.

00:05:49.358 --> 00:05:52.073
CA: I mean, there are other programs
started from scratch.

00:05:52.097 --> 00:05:55.445
That last phrase you said there,
you let physics drive the design,

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:57.841
what's an example of that?

00:05:57.865 --> 00:06:00.984
GS: There's hundreds of examples,
actually, of that,

00:06:01.008 --> 00:06:05.388
but basically, we got to construct
the vehicle design

00:06:05.412 --> 00:06:07.476
from, really, a clean sheet of paper,

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.356
and we got to make decisions
that we wanted to make.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.149
The tank architecture --
it's a common dome design.

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:16.744
Basically it's like two beer cans
stacked together,

00:06:16.768 --> 00:06:18.378
one full of liquid oxygen,

00:06:18.402 --> 00:06:20.521
one full of RP,

00:06:20.545 --> 00:06:23.179
and that basically saved weight.

00:06:23.203 --> 00:06:27.847
It allowed us to basically take
more payload for the same design.

00:06:27.871 --> 00:06:31.266
One of the other elements of the vehicle
that we're flying right now

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.626
is we do use densified
liquid oxygen and densified RP,

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.091
so it's ultracold,

00:06:36.115 --> 00:06:40.843
and it allows you to pack
more propellent into the vehicle.

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:42.348
It is done elsewhere,

00:06:42.372 --> 00:06:44.650
probably not to the degree that we do it,

00:06:44.674 --> 00:06:46.675
but it adds a lot
of margin to the vehicle,

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:48.917
which obviously adds reliability.

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:53.377
CA: Gwynne, you became President
of SpaceX 10 years ago, I think.

00:06:53.401 --> 00:06:56.916
What's it been like to work
so closely with Elon Musk?

00:06:57.408 --> 00:06:59.855
GS: So I love working for Elon.

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:02.340
I've been doing it for 16 years
this year, actually.

00:07:02.364 --> 00:07:05.799
I don't think I'm dumb enough
to do something for 16 years

00:07:05.823 --> 00:07:07.799
that I don't like doing.

00:07:07.823 --> 00:07:09.743
He's funny

00:07:09.767 --> 00:07:12.915
and fundamentally without
him saying anything

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:15.705
he drives you to do your best work.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.743
He doesn't have to say a word.

00:07:17.767 --> 00:07:19.623
You just want to do great work.

00:07:20.101 --> 00:07:23.112
CA: You might be the person
best placed to answer this question,

00:07:23.136 --> 00:07:24.629
which has puzzled me,

00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:28.135
which is to shed light
on this strange unit of time

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:30.935
called "Elon time."

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:34.120
For example, last year,
I asked Elon, you know,

00:07:34.144 --> 00:07:37.588
when Tesla would
auto-drive across America,

00:07:37.612 --> 00:07:39.937
and he said by last December,

00:07:39.961 --> 00:07:44.265
which is definitely true,
if you take Elon time into account.

00:07:44.289 --> 00:07:48.868
So what's the conversion ratio
between Elon time and real time?

00:07:48.892 --> 00:07:49.899
(Laughter)

00:07:49.923 --> 00:07:51.933
GS: You put me
in a unique position, Chris.

00:07:51.957 --> 00:07:53.825
Thanks for that.

00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:56.945
There's no question that Elon
is very aggressive on his timelines,

00:07:56.969 --> 00:08:01.502
but frankly, that drives us
to do things better and faster.

00:08:01.526 --> 00:08:03.914
I think all the time
and all the money in the world

00:08:03.938 --> 00:08:05.803
does not yield the best solution,

00:08:05.827 --> 00:08:10.573
and so putting that pressure on the team
to move quickly is really important.

00:08:11.531 --> 00:08:14.549
CA: It feels like you play
kind of a key intermediary role here.

00:08:14.573 --> 00:08:19.060
I mean, he sets these crazy goals
that have their impact,

00:08:19.084 --> 00:08:22.578
but, in other circumstances,
might blow up a team

00:08:22.602 --> 00:08:24.688
or set impossible expectations.

00:08:24.823 --> 00:08:28.252
It feels like you've found a way
of saying, "Yes, Elon,"

00:08:28.648 --> 00:08:31.125
and then making it happen
in a way that is acceptable

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.077
both to him and to your company,
to your employees.

00:08:34.296 --> 00:08:37.949
GS: There is two really important
realizations for that.

00:08:37.973 --> 00:08:42.583
First of all, when Elon says something,
you have to pause

00:08:42.607 --> 00:08:46.682
and not immediately blurt out,
"Well, that's impossible,"

00:08:46.706 --> 00:08:49.671
or, "There's no way we're going
to do that. I don't know how."

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:51.537
So you zip it, and you think about it,

00:08:51.561 --> 00:08:53.409
and you find ways to get that done.

00:08:53.801 --> 00:08:56.058
And the other thing I realized,

00:08:56.082 --> 00:08:59.117
and it made my job satisfaction
substantially harder.

00:08:59.141 --> 00:09:04.101
So I always felt like my job
was to take these ideas

00:09:04.125 --> 00:09:07.608
and kind of turn them into company goals,
make them achievable,

00:09:07.632 --> 00:09:12.234
and kind of roll the company over
from this steep slope, get it comfortable.

00:09:12.258 --> 00:09:15.297
And I noticed every time
I felt like we were there,

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:18.634
we were rolling over,
people were getting comfortable,

00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:20.420
Elon would throw something out there,

00:09:20.444 --> 00:09:22.587
and all of a sudden, we're not comfortable

00:09:22.611 --> 00:09:24.928
and we're climbing that steep slope again.

00:09:24.952 --> 00:09:27.578
But then once I realized
that that's his job,

00:09:27.602 --> 00:09:30.924
and my job is to get the company
close to comfortable

00:09:30.948 --> 00:09:33.657
so he can push again
and put us back on that slope,

00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:35.652
then I started liking my job a lot more,

00:09:35.676 --> 00:09:37.765
instead of always being frustrated.

00:09:37.789 --> 00:09:41.090
CA: So if I estimated
that the conversation ratio

00:09:41.114 --> 00:09:43.407
for Elon time to your time is about 2x,

00:09:43.431 --> 00:09:46.351
am I a long way out there?

00:09:46.375 --> 00:09:48.939
GS: That's not terrible,
and you said it, I didn't.

00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:50.954
(Laughter)

00:09:50.978 --> 00:09:52.977
CA: You know, looking ahead,

00:09:53.001 --> 00:09:54.669
one huge initiative

00:09:54.693 --> 00:09:57.699
SpaceX is believed to be,
rumored to be working on,

00:09:57.723 --> 00:10:04.278
is a massive network of literally
thousands of low earth orbit satellites

00:10:04.302 --> 00:10:07.817
to provide high-bandwidth,
low-cost internet connection

00:10:07.841 --> 00:10:10.206
to every square foot of planet earth.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.464
Is there anything
you can tell us about this?

00:10:12.488 --> 00:10:16.590
GS: We actually don't chat very much
about this particular project,

00:10:16.614 --> 00:10:18.304
not because we're hiding anything,

00:10:18.328 --> 00:10:20.574
but this is probably
one of the most challenging

00:10:20.598 --> 00:10:23.136
if not the most challenging
project we've undertaken.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.002
No one has been successful

00:10:25.026 --> 00:10:28.607
deploying a huge constellation
for internet broadband,

00:10:28.631 --> 00:10:30.930
or basically for satellite internet,

00:10:30.954 --> 00:10:33.569
and I don't think physics
is the difficulty here.

00:10:33.593 --> 00:10:36.469
I think we can come up
with the right technology solution,

00:10:36.493 --> 00:10:38.753
but we need to make a business out of it,

00:10:38.777 --> 00:10:42.364
and it'll cost the company
about 10 billion dollars or more

00:10:42.388 --> 00:10:44.149
to deploy this system.

00:10:44.173 --> 00:10:48.234
And so we're marching steadily along

00:10:48.258 --> 00:10:50.623
but we're certainly
not claiming victory yet.

00:10:50.647 --> 00:10:54.076
CA: I mean, the impact of that,
obviously, if that happened to the world,

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.488
of connectivity everywhere,
would be pretty radical,

00:10:57.512 --> 00:10:59.005
and perhaps mainly for good --

00:10:59.029 --> 00:11:02.844
I mean, it changes a lot
if suddenly everyone can connect cheaply.

00:11:02.868 --> 00:11:05.345
GS: Yeah, there's no question
it'll change the world.

00:11:05.369 --> 00:11:07.217
CA: How much of a worry is it,

00:11:07.241 --> 00:11:09.424
and how much of a drag
on the planning is it,

00:11:09.448 --> 00:11:11.433
are concerns just about space junk?

00:11:11.457 --> 00:11:12.925
People worry a lot about this.

00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:16.292
This would a huge increase in the total
number of satellites in orbit.

00:11:16.316 --> 00:11:17.467
Is that a concern?

00:11:17.491 --> 00:11:21.172
GS: So space debris is a concern,
there's no question --

00:11:21.196 --> 00:11:23.711
not because it's so likely to happen,

00:11:23.735 --> 00:11:27.629
but the consequences of it happening
are pretty devastating.

00:11:27.653 --> 00:11:31.419
You could basically spew
a bunch of particles in orbit

00:11:31.443 --> 00:11:36.601
that could take out that orbit
from being useful for decades or longer.

00:11:36.625 --> 00:11:38.443
So as a matter of fact,

00:11:38.467 --> 00:11:42.346
we are required to bring down
our second stage after every mission

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:46.497
so it doesn't end up being
a rocket carcass orbiting earth.

00:11:46.521 --> 00:11:49.337
So you really need to be
a good steward of that.

00:11:50.398 --> 00:11:54.498
CA: So despite
the remarkable success there

00:11:54.522 --> 00:11:57.869
of that Falcon Heavy rocket,

00:11:57.893 --> 00:12:01.141
you're actually not focusing on that
as your future development plan.

00:12:01.165 --> 00:12:04.156
You're doubling down
to a much bigger rocket

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.688
called the BFR,

00:12:05.712 --> 00:12:07.482
which stands for ...

00:12:07.506 --> 00:12:11.839
GS: It's the Big Falcon Rocket.
CA: The Big Falcon Rocket, that's right.

00:12:11.863 --> 00:12:13.529
(Laughter)

00:12:13.553 --> 00:12:16.223
What's the business logic of doing this

00:12:16.247 --> 00:12:19.545
when you invested all that
in that incredible technology,

00:12:19.569 --> 00:12:22.397
and now you're just going
to something much bigger. Why?

00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:24.333
GS: Actually, we've learned some lessons

00:12:24.357 --> 00:12:28.044
over the duration where we've
been developing these launch systems.

00:12:28.068 --> 00:12:32.948
What we want to do is not introduce
a new product before we've been able

00:12:32.972 --> 00:12:36.551
to convince the customers that this
is the product that they should move to,

00:12:36.575 --> 00:12:39.947
so we're working on
the Big Falcon Rocket now,

00:12:39.971 --> 00:12:42.986
but we're going to continue
flying Falcon 9s and Falcon Heavies

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:46.081
until there is absolute
widespread acceptance of BFR.

00:12:46.867 --> 00:12:48.795
But we are working on it right now,

00:12:48.819 --> 00:12:52.049
we're just not going to cancel
Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy

00:12:52.073 --> 00:12:54.977
and just put in place BFR.

00:12:55.001 --> 00:12:59.500
CA: The logic is that BFR is what you need
to take humanity to Mars?

00:12:59.524 --> 00:13:00.753
GS: That's correct.

00:13:00.777 --> 00:13:04.887
CA: But somehow, you've also found
other business ideas for this.

00:13:04.911 --> 00:13:08.383
GS: Yes. BFR can take the satellites
that we're currently taking to orbit

00:13:08.407 --> 00:13:09.640
to many orbits.

00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:14.989
It allows for even a new class
of satellites to be delivered to orbit.

00:13:15.013 --> 00:13:18.639
Basically, the width, the diameter
of the fairing is eight meters,

00:13:18.663 --> 00:13:21.012
so you can think about
what giant telescopes

00:13:21.036 --> 00:13:24.456
you can put in that fairing,
in that cargo bay,

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.575
and see really incredible things

00:13:26.599 --> 00:13:28.868
and discover incredible things in space.

00:13:28.892 --> 00:13:31.074
But then there are some
residual capabilities

00:13:31.098 --> 00:13:33.406
that we have out of BFR as well.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.202
CA: A residual capability?
GS: It's a residual capability.

00:13:36.226 --> 00:13:39.335
CA: Is that what you call this?
Talk about what the heck this is.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.511
Oh wait a sec --

00:13:40.535 --> 00:13:41.706
GS: That's Falcon Heavy.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:43.541
That's worth pointing out, by the way.

00:13:43.565 --> 00:13:44.976
What a beautiful rocket,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.960
and that hangar could just fit
the Statue of Liberty in it,

00:13:49.984 --> 00:13:54.380
so you get a sense of size
of that Falcon Heavy Rocket.

00:13:54.404 --> 00:13:56.880
CA: And the fact that
there are 27 engines there.

00:13:56.904 --> 00:13:58.571
That's part of the design principle

00:13:58.595 --> 00:14:01.824
that you, rather than just
inventing ever bigger rockets,

00:14:01.848 --> 00:14:02.998
you team them up.

00:14:03.014 --> 00:14:05.100
GS: It's exactly this residual capability.

00:14:05.124 --> 00:14:08.142
We developed the Merlin engine
for the Falcon 1 launch vehicle.

00:14:08.166 --> 00:14:09.932
We could have tossed that engine

00:14:09.956 --> 00:14:12.917
and built an entirely new engine
for the Falcon 9.

00:14:12.941 --> 00:14:15.119
It would have been called
something different,

00:14:15.143 --> 00:14:17.048
because Falcon 9 is nine Merlin engines,

00:14:17.072 --> 00:14:20.111
but instead of spending a billion dollars
on a brand new engine,

00:14:20.135 --> 00:14:23.321
we put nine of them together
on the back end of Falcon 9.

00:14:23.345 --> 00:14:26.425
Residual capability:
glue three Falcon 9s together

00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:29.568
and you have the largest
operational rocket flying.

00:14:29.592 --> 00:14:31.401
And so it was expensive to do,

00:14:31.425 --> 00:14:34.651
but it was a much more efficient path
than starting from scratch.

00:14:34.675 --> 00:14:38.536
CA: And the BFR is the equivalent
of how much bigger than that,

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.711
in terms of its power?

00:14:39.735 --> 00:14:42.855
GS: BFR is about, I believe,
two and half times the size of this.

00:14:42.879 --> 00:14:44.856
CA: Right, and so that allows you --

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.567
I mean, I still don't really believe
this video that we're about to play here.

00:14:48.591 --> 00:14:50.442
What on earth is this?

00:14:50.863 --> 00:14:53.722
GS: So it currently is on earth,

00:14:53.746 --> 00:14:56.878
but this is basically
space travel for earthlings.

00:14:56.903 --> 00:14:59.124
I can't wait for this residual capability.

00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:03.804
Basically, what we're going to do
is we're going to fly BFR like an aircraft

00:15:03.828 --> 00:15:06.414
and do point-to-point travel on earth,

00:15:06.438 --> 00:15:10.465
so you can take off
from New York City or Vancouver

00:15:10.489 --> 00:15:12.527
and fly halfway across the globe.

00:15:12.551 --> 00:15:16.566
You'll be on the BFR for roughly
half an hour or 40 minutes,

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:19.034
and the longest part --
yeah, it's so awesome.

00:15:19.058 --> 00:15:20.150
(Applause)

00:15:20.174 --> 00:15:24.367
The longest part of that flight
is actually the boat out and back.

00:15:24.391 --> 00:15:25.392
(Laughter)

00:15:25.416 --> 00:15:28.818
CA: I mean. Gwynne, come on,
this is awesome, but it's crazy, right?

00:15:28.842 --> 00:15:31.692
This is never going to actually happen.

00:15:31.716 --> 00:15:33.735
GS: Oh no, it's definitely
going to happen.

00:15:33.759 --> 00:15:35.426
This is definitely going to happen.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:36.601
CA: How?

00:15:36.625 --> 00:15:40.759
(Applause)

00:15:40.783 --> 00:15:45.039
So first of all, countries are going
to accept this incoming missile --

00:15:45.063 --> 00:15:46.064
(Laughter)

00:15:46.088 --> 00:15:50.429
GS: Chris, so can you imagine
us trying to convince a federal range,

00:15:50.453 --> 00:15:52.596
Air Force bases to take the incomers?

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.800
Because we're doing it now,
regularly, right?

00:15:54.824 --> 00:15:56.625
We're bringing the first stages back,

00:15:56.649 --> 00:15:59.656
and we're landing them
on federal property on an Air Force base.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.425
So I think doing it, I don't know,

00:16:01.449 --> 00:16:05.178
10 kilometers out from a city, maybe
it's only five kilometers out from a city.

00:16:05.202 --> 00:16:08.017
CA: So how many passengers
can possibly afford the fortune

00:16:08.041 --> 00:16:09.060
of flying by space?

00:16:09.132 --> 00:16:14.140
GS: So the first BFR is going to have
roughly a hundred passengers.

00:16:14.165 --> 00:16:16.363
And let's talk a little bit
about the business.

00:16:16.387 --> 00:16:18.529
Everyone thinks rockets
are really expensive,

00:16:18.554 --> 00:16:20.093
and to a large degree they are,

00:16:20.463 --> 00:16:23.273
and how could we possibly compete
with airline tickets here?

00:16:23.298 --> 00:16:25.613
But if you think about it,
if I can do this trip

00:16:25.638 --> 00:16:28.567
in half an hour to an hour,

00:16:28.591 --> 00:16:31.547
I can do dozens of these a day, right?

00:16:31.571 --> 00:16:35.193
And yet, a long-haul aircraft
can only make one of those flights a day.

00:16:35.217 --> 00:16:37.526
So even if my rocket
was slightly more expensive

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.586
and the fuel is
a little bit more expensive,

00:16:39.611 --> 00:16:42.511
I can run 10x at least
what they're running in a day,

00:16:42.536 --> 00:16:46.027
and really make the revenue
that I need to out of that system.

00:16:46.051 --> 00:16:49.325
CA: So you really believe this is going
to be deployed at some point

00:16:49.349 --> 00:16:51.018
in our amazing future. When?

00:16:51.042 --> 00:16:52.885
GS: Within a decade, for sure.

00:16:53.495 --> 00:16:56.113
CA: And this is Gwynne time or Elon time?

00:16:56.137 --> 00:16:59.209
GS: That's Gwynne time.
I'm sure Elon will want us to go faster.

00:16:59.233 --> 00:17:00.478
(Laughter)

00:17:01.056 --> 00:17:05.167
CA: OK, that's certainly amazing.

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:06.812
(Laughter)

00:17:06.836 --> 00:17:09.880
GS: I'm personally invested in this one,
because I travel a lot

00:17:09.904 --> 00:17:11.272
and I do not love to travel,

00:17:11.296 --> 00:17:14.883
and I would love to get to see
my customers in Riyadh,

00:17:14.907 --> 00:17:18.125
leave in the morning
and be back in time to make dinner.

00:17:18.149 --> 00:17:19.918
CA: So we're going to test this out.

00:17:19.942 --> 00:17:22.712
So within 10 years,
an economy price ticket,

00:17:22.736 --> 00:17:28.386
or, like, a couple thousand dollars
per person to fly New York to Shanghai.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:31.520
GS: Yeah, I think it'll be between
economy and business,

00:17:31.544 --> 00:17:32.942
but you do it in an hour.

00:17:32.966 --> 00:17:35.743
CA: Yeah, well, OK,
that is definitely something.

00:17:35.767 --> 00:17:36.768
(Laughter)

00:17:36.792 --> 00:17:40.131
And meanwhile, the other use
of BFR is being developed

00:17:40.155 --> 00:17:43.344
to go a little bit further than Shanghai.

00:17:43.368 --> 00:17:44.610
Talk about this.

00:17:44.634 --> 00:17:48.627
You guys have actually developed
quite a detailed, sort of, picture

00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:52.071
of how humans might fly to Mars,

00:17:52.095 --> 00:17:53.687
and what that would look like.

00:17:53.711 --> 00:17:56.283
GS: Yeah. So we've got a video,
this is a cropped video

00:17:56.307 --> 00:17:59.616
from others we've shown, and then
there's a couple of new bits to it.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.958
But basically, you're going
to lift off from a pad,

00:18:02.982 --> 00:18:06.923
you've got a booster as well as the BFS,
the Big Falcon Spaceship.

00:18:07.535 --> 00:18:08.717
It's going to take off.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:14.941
The booster is going to drop
the spaceship off in orbit,

00:18:14.965 --> 00:18:16.115
low earth orbit,

00:18:16.139 --> 00:18:19.345
and then return just like
we're returning boosters right now.

00:18:19.369 --> 00:18:22.091
So it sounds incredible,
but we're working on the pieces,

00:18:22.115 --> 00:18:24.083
and you can see us achieve these pieces.

00:18:24.107 --> 00:18:25.310
So booster comes back.

00:18:25.334 --> 00:18:26.485
The new thing here

00:18:26.509 --> 00:18:29.828
is that we're going to actually land
on the pad that we launched from.

00:18:29.852 --> 00:18:32.820
Currently, we land on a separate pad,
or we land out on a boat.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:35.063
Fast, quick connect.

00:18:35.087 --> 00:18:37.756
You take a cargo ship full of fuel,

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:38.953
or a fuel depot,

00:18:38.977 --> 00:18:41.451
put it on that booster, get that in orbit,

00:18:41.475 --> 00:18:44.399
do a docking maneuver,
refuel the spaceship,

00:18:45.979 --> 00:18:47.853
and head on to your destination,

00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:49.990
and this one is Mars.

00:18:51.131 --> 00:18:56.432
CA: So, like, a hundred people
go to Mars at one time,

00:18:56.456 --> 00:18:59.146
taking, what, six months? Two months?

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.796
GS: It ends up depending
on how big the rocket is.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.002
I think this first version,
and we'll continue to make

00:19:05.026 --> 00:19:07.184
even bigger BFRs,

00:19:07.208 --> 00:19:09.239
I think it's a three-month trip.

00:19:09.263 --> 00:19:11.178
Right now, the average is six to eight,

00:19:11.202 --> 00:19:13.164
but we're going to try to do it faster.

00:19:13.188 --> 00:19:17.643
CA: When do you believe SpaceX
will land the first human on Mars?

00:19:17.667 --> 00:19:20.429
GS: It's a very similar time frame
from the point-to-point.

00:19:20.453 --> 00:19:21.698
It's the same capability.

00:19:21.722 --> 00:19:25.931
It will be within a decade --
not this decade.

00:19:25.955 --> 00:19:28.165
CA: In real time, again, within a decade.

00:19:28.189 --> 00:19:30.988
Well, that would also be amazing.

00:19:31.012 --> 00:19:32.162
(Laughter)

00:19:32.186 --> 00:19:34.701
Why, though? Seriously, why?

00:19:34.725 --> 00:19:38.479
I mean, you've got a company
where this is the official stated mission.

00:19:38.503 --> 00:19:41.010
Has everyone actually
bought into that mission,

00:19:41.034 --> 00:19:43.726
given that, I mean,
there's a lot of people around

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.908
who think, come on,
you've got so much talent,

00:19:45.932 --> 00:19:47.629
so much technology capability.

00:19:47.653 --> 00:19:50.964
There are so many things on earth
that need urgent attention.

00:19:50.988 --> 00:19:53.933
Why would you have this escape trip
off to another planet?

00:19:53.957 --> 00:19:55.592
(Applause)

00:19:55.616 --> 00:19:57.296
GS: So I am glad you asked that,

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.964
but I think we need
to expand our minds a little bit.

00:19:59.988 --> 00:20:02.067
There are plenty of things to do on earth,

00:20:02.091 --> 00:20:04.662
but there are lots of companies
working on that.

00:20:04.686 --> 00:20:08.981
I think we're working on one of
the most important things we possibly can,

00:20:09.005 --> 00:20:13.732
and that's to find another place
for humans to live and survive and thrive.

00:20:13.756 --> 00:20:17.065
If something happened on earth,

00:20:17.089 --> 00:20:19.184
you need humans living somewhere else.

00:20:20.896 --> 00:20:22.668
(Applause)

00:20:22.692 --> 00:20:25.449
It's the fundamental risk reduction
for the human species.

00:20:25.473 --> 00:20:27.696
And this does not subvert

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:32.529
making our planet here better
and doing a better job taking care of it,

00:20:32.553 --> 00:20:35.663
but I think you need
multiple paths to survival,

00:20:35.687 --> 00:20:37.830
and this is one of them.

00:20:37.854 --> 00:20:39.953
And let's not talk about the downer piece,

00:20:39.977 --> 00:20:43.365
like, you go to Mars to make sure
all earthlings don't die.

00:20:43.389 --> 00:20:47.039
That's terrible, actually,
that's a terrible reason to go do it.

00:20:47.063 --> 00:20:49.991
Fundamentally,
it's another place to explore,

00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:53.413
and that's what makes humans
different from animals,

00:20:53.437 --> 00:20:55.914
it's our sense of exploration
and sense of wonderment

00:20:55.938 --> 00:20:57.315
and learning something new.

00:20:57.339 --> 00:20:59.854
And then I also have to say,

00:20:59.878 --> 00:21:03.719
this is the first step
in us moving to other solar systems

00:21:03.743 --> 00:21:05.327
and potentially other galaxies,

00:21:05.351 --> 00:21:08.496
and I think this is the only time
I ever out-vision Elon,

00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:11.369
because I want to meet other people
in other solar systems.

00:21:11.393 --> 00:21:13.662
Mars is fine, but it is
a fixer-upper planet.

00:21:13.686 --> 00:21:15.870
There's work to do there
to make it habitable.

00:21:15.894 --> 00:21:16.895
(Laughter)

00:21:16.919 --> 00:21:19.906
I want to find people,
or whatever they call themselves,

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:21.549
in another solar system.

00:21:21.573 --> 00:21:23.801
CA: That is a big vision.

00:21:23.825 --> 00:21:25.595
Gwynne Shotwell, thank you.

00:21:25.619 --> 00:21:28.049
You have one of the most
amazing jobs on the planet.

00:21:28.073 --> 00:21:30.407
GS: Thank you very much. Thanks, Chris.
