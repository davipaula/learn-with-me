00:00:10.085 --> 00:00:16.620
The month of September 1942
is etched in my memory.

00:00:16.989 --> 00:00:20.459
It was a few weeks
before my twelfth birthday,

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.950
and my father had just died.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.554
My mother, who had
no professional training,

00:00:27.044 --> 00:00:33.340
found it very hard to spend
the fees for our school fees.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.833
And my three brothers and me,

00:00:36.993 --> 00:00:41.355
she took the help of friends
and scholarships

00:00:41.695 --> 00:00:43.460
in order to educate us.

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:48.670
She didn't make a difference 
between my brothers and me.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.842
All she wanted was that
all of us should excel.

00:00:54.126 --> 00:00:57.913
When I was 20, I had
a semi-arranged marriage,

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.465
and my husband was posted,
in 1954, to England,

00:01:03.465 --> 00:01:04.978
and I went with him.

00:01:05.763 --> 00:01:10.740
And I took advantage of being there
for three years and studied law.

00:01:11.796 --> 00:01:14.104
When I returned to India,

00:01:14.404 --> 00:01:20.405
I was required to train with a senior 
before I could practice law.

00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:23.856
So I decided I should get the best lawyer,

00:01:23.856 --> 00:01:25.569
join the best lawyer,

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:29.130
and I zeroed down on someone 
called Sachin Chaudhary.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.930
But it was extremely difficult
to get an appointment with him.

00:01:34.124 --> 00:01:36.077
After great difficulty, I did,

00:01:37.217 --> 00:01:44.233
and I was full of trepidation
when I went to meet him.

00:01:45.252 --> 00:01:48.508
But I put on a brave front, 
just as I am doing now.

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:49.877
(Laughter)

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:52.018
(Applause)

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.665
He had some idea why I had come,

00:01:59.665 --> 00:02:01.748
but he wanted to be completely clear.

00:02:01.748 --> 00:02:05.355
So I told him that I wanted
to practice law

00:02:05.355 --> 00:02:07.506
and I wanted to join his chambers.

00:02:08.284 --> 00:02:12.594
He was not in favor
of women joining the law,

00:02:12.594 --> 00:02:14.125
so he tried to dissuade me.

00:02:14.652 --> 00:02:15.778
He said,

00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:19.956
"Young woman, instead of joining 
the legal profession,

00:02:19.956 --> 00:02:21.231
go and get married."

00:02:21.231 --> 00:02:22.268
(Laughter)

00:02:22.268 --> 00:02:23.281
So I said to him,

00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:25.453
"Sir, I am already married."

00:02:25.453 --> 00:02:26.685
(Laughter)

00:02:26.685 --> 00:02:29.676
"Then go and have a child," he advised.

00:02:29.676 --> 00:02:32.042
"I already have a child."

00:02:32.042 --> 00:02:33.223
(Laughter)

00:02:33.223 --> 00:02:36.531
"It's not fair to the child to be alone,

00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:38.757
so you should have a second child."

00:02:38.757 --> 00:02:40.088
(Laughter)

00:02:40.088 --> 00:02:43.528
I said, "Mr. Chaudhary,
I have two children."

00:02:43.528 --> 00:02:46.618
(Laughter)

00:02:46.618 --> 00:02:49.982
So, taken aback
for the third time, he said,

00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:51.810
"Come and join my chambers.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.719
You're a persistent young woman,
and you will do well at the bar."

00:02:57.616 --> 00:03:00.235
After about 20 years of practice,

00:03:00.235 --> 00:03:03.550
I was appointed a judge
at the Delhi High Court,

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.927
and in 1991,

00:03:06.307 --> 00:03:11.113
I was the first woman to be chief justice
of a state high court.

00:03:11.113 --> 00:03:13.442
(Applause)

00:03:18.292 --> 00:03:19.527
As I mentioned earlier,

00:03:19.527 --> 00:03:21.862
I was 20 when I got married,

00:03:22.742 --> 00:03:29.489
and my fiancee and his family 
never demanded a dowry or anything else.

00:03:30.423 --> 00:03:32.215
We had a simple celebration.

00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:38.254
We served vanilla ice cream
and salted cashew nuts.

00:03:38.254 --> 00:03:42.317
But we still had fun,
and we enjoyed ourselves.

00:03:42.317 --> 00:03:46.264
So, you can see, that you
don't need anything extra.

00:03:46.264 --> 00:03:52.238
But I, now, I'm happily married
for the last 64 years.

00:03:52.238 --> 00:03:54.039
(Applause)

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.199
Every woman, every mother,
wants her daughter to be married.

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:08.333
And when she meets a young man,

00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:13.150
she tries to size him up
to find out if he's a suitable boy.

00:04:14.567 --> 00:04:17.663
But at the back of her mind is worry.

00:04:17.663 --> 00:04:19.349
Does he want a dowry?

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:21.893
If so, how much?

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.745
In fact, it's the curse of dowry

00:04:26.095 --> 00:04:30.780
that makes parents not want to have girls.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.480
In the old days, when girls and boys
didn't have equal inheritance,

00:04:38.052 --> 00:04:42.692
a young girl was given stridhan, 
which is bride's wealth,

00:04:43.252 --> 00:04:45.022
at the time of her marriage.

00:04:45.992 --> 00:04:49.452
It was something that was passed 
from a mother to her daughter

00:04:49.452 --> 00:04:50.934
and consisted of jewelry.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.985
It was her personal property.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.085
But even that was often taken away
by the bride-groom's parents

00:04:59.085 --> 00:05:02.465
and given to the groom's sister 
when she was getting married.

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.059
So the bride had nothing.

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.289
Slowly, the prevalence of dowries started.

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:11.415
This meant gifts were given

00:05:11.415 --> 00:05:13.175
not only to the bride

00:05:13.392 --> 00:05:17.128
but to the bride-groom and to his family.

00:05:17.664 --> 00:05:20.242
And demands, dowry demands,

00:05:20.242 --> 00:05:23.696
were negotiated at the time
of an arranged marriage.

00:05:24.826 --> 00:05:29.531
Parents were worried as to how 
they would meet these demands,

00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:34.669
which sometimes increased
from day to day and from hour to hour

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.693
as the wedding date approached.

00:05:36.693 --> 00:05:41.003
Sometimes, just as the wedding ceremony
was about to take place,

00:05:41.003 --> 00:05:42.846
a fresh demand would be made.

00:05:43.447 --> 00:05:45.298
It was a great trauma for parents,

00:05:45.298 --> 00:05:47.918
especially those who had
more than one daughter.

00:05:47.918 --> 00:05:51.864
They were bankrupt,
spent more than they had,

00:05:51.864 --> 00:05:57.736
and the extortion sometimes 
continued even after the wedding.

00:05:58.192 --> 00:06:01.648
So instead of loving their daughters
and wanting to have them,

00:06:01.953 --> 00:06:03.535
they considered them a curse.

00:06:04.913 --> 00:06:09.710
And they resorted to something
like female feticide

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.818
or female infanticide.

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:17.638
In order to prevent this evil of dowry,

00:06:17.981 --> 00:06:19.183
an act was passed.

00:06:19.183 --> 00:06:21.214
It was called the Dowry Prohibition Act,

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:22.566
1961.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.622
Before the act,
dowries were displayed openly.

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:29.369
After the act, the displays stopped.

00:06:30.498 --> 00:06:33.893
But the giving and taking
of dowry continued,

00:06:34.464 --> 00:06:40.148
and the demand for ostentatious
functions and feasts

00:06:40.148 --> 00:06:42.365
by the bride-groom's family,

00:06:42.365 --> 00:06:45.683
to be paid for by the bride's family,

00:06:45.683 --> 00:06:47.122
continued.

00:06:48.316 --> 00:06:51.511
This was really terrible.

00:06:51.511 --> 00:06:54.735
And very few parents

00:06:54.735 --> 00:06:58.620
would reject a young man

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.768
if he or his family demanded a dowry.

00:07:01.768 --> 00:07:03.355
Most would not,

00:07:03.355 --> 00:07:08.576
even though they knew
it was illegal to give or take a dowry.

00:07:08.576 --> 00:07:10.547
Let me give you an example.

00:07:11.368 --> 00:07:13.338
The year was 1991.

00:07:13.703 --> 00:07:17.367
A very senior Supreme Court of India judge

00:07:17.367 --> 00:07:19.561
had arranged his daughter's wedding.

00:07:20.998 --> 00:07:22.021
I asked him,

00:07:22.021 --> 00:07:23.888
"Are you going to give a dowry?"

00:07:25.098 --> 00:07:26.139
Remember,

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:30.830
this was 30 years after the passing
of the Dowry Prohibition Act.

00:07:31.067 --> 00:07:32.632
He was quiet.

00:07:33.116 --> 00:07:34.938
And then he said,

00:07:35.258 --> 00:07:37.213
"I'll tell you the honest truth.

00:07:37.892 --> 00:07:40.789
I will indeed give a dowry for my daughter

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:46.099
because I cannot sacrifice
her happiness and her life.

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:51.226
In my community, she cannot
get married without a dowry.

00:07:52.457 --> 00:07:56.577
But I promise you,
I will not take a dowry for my son."

00:07:58.248 --> 00:08:00.578
This is not what I wanted to hear,

00:08:00.634 --> 00:08:05.184
but at least it was half a step forward.

00:08:06.193 --> 00:08:07.621
So what do you think?

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:11.947
Can the passing of laws change attitudes?

00:08:14.114 --> 00:08:19.873
In India, with a very patriarchal society,

00:08:19.873 --> 00:08:25.013
changing attitudes and changing
mindsets is extremely difficult,

00:08:25.013 --> 00:08:28.473
and it's a slow process,
but we need to fast-forward it.

00:08:29.184 --> 00:08:30.612
I had hoped

00:08:30.982 --> 00:08:34.190
that with the succession laws
being changed

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.070
and daughters getting
some inheritance rights,

00:08:37.866 --> 00:08:41.792
the law would have had
some effect on the evil of dowry.

00:08:43.578 --> 00:08:45.498
In 1956,

00:08:46.028 --> 00:08:48.498
the Hindu Succession Act was passed,

00:08:48.727 --> 00:08:50.387
and in that year,

00:08:50.387 --> 00:08:54.827
it was provided in the act
that daughters and sons

00:08:55.108 --> 00:08:57.386
would get equally

00:08:57.386 --> 00:09:01.547
from their father's property
which was self-acquired.

00:09:03.946 --> 00:09:06.854
This, of course, 
should have made a difference.

00:09:07.543 --> 00:09:09.943
But it didn't seem to have done that.

00:09:10.975 --> 00:09:14.705
In fact, women
were not willing to assert.

00:09:15.401 --> 00:09:17.091
Let me tell you of an incident.

00:09:18.462 --> 00:09:20.492
I was a judge at the Delhi High Court.

00:09:20.492 --> 00:09:23.864
Three young men
came for me and wanted -

00:09:23.864 --> 00:09:25.030
their father had died,

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.017
he hadn't left a will,

00:09:27.017 --> 00:09:30.717
and they wanted their property
to be divided into three parts.

00:09:31.085 --> 00:09:33.071
I found they had three sisters.

00:09:33.474 --> 00:09:34.637
So I said to them,

00:09:34.637 --> 00:09:39.211
"I will divide it into six parts
because that's what the law says,

00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:41.748
and each sibling should get one share."

00:09:43.456 --> 00:09:44.527
They protested.

00:09:44.527 --> 00:09:45.837
They said,

00:09:45.837 --> 00:09:47.633
"Our sisters are married,

00:09:47.633 --> 00:09:50.009
our sisters have got dowries,

00:09:50.699 --> 00:09:55.154
and they have given us 
relinquishment deeds."

00:09:56.133 --> 00:10:00.641
I was not happy, so I insisted
they bring the sisters to court

00:10:00.641 --> 00:10:01.907
because I was not sure

00:10:01.907 --> 00:10:06.137
whether the sisters had been coerced
into giving their relinquishment deeds

00:10:06.137 --> 00:10:07.903
or they didn't know the law.

00:10:08.763 --> 00:10:10.748
When the women came, I asked them,

00:10:10.748 --> 00:10:12.385
"Do you know the law?"

00:10:12.539 --> 00:10:15.721
And they said, "Yes."

00:10:15.721 --> 00:10:17.809
"So then why are you
giving up your share?"

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.491
And this is what they said:

00:10:21.397 --> 00:10:27.214
"We do not want to have
any problems with our brothers

00:10:27.214 --> 00:10:30.239
or spoil our relationships
with our brothers

00:10:30.239 --> 00:10:34.943
because if in the future
we need anything of any sort,

00:10:34.943 --> 00:10:39.746
to whom shall we turn
except our brothers, our natal family?"

00:10:41.537 --> 00:10:45.872
So they knew what was happening.

00:10:46.252 --> 00:10:48.950
And I said to the young men,

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.468
"If you were six brothers,

00:10:51.468 --> 00:10:54.959
you would have happily shared 
and got one-sixth each,

00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:57.559
so why are you depriving your sisters?"

00:10:58.058 --> 00:10:59.975
But they were adamant,

00:10:59.975 --> 00:11:06.073
and their sisters also were not willing
to withdraw their relinquishment deeds.

00:11:06.906 --> 00:11:11.956
So, though they were aware,
they were not willing to assert.

00:11:14.293 --> 00:11:19.103
Many people are not aware
that since 2005 -

00:11:19.325 --> 00:11:21.045
that's almost 10 years ago -

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:26.480
the daughters' rights of inheritance
have been widened

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.146
and now include not only
the self-acquired property of the father

00:11:31.486 --> 00:11:34.776
but also the ancestral property -

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:42.146
unless, of course, the father
wills away the property to someone else.

00:11:42.287 --> 00:11:45.075
So fathers, we tell you,

00:11:45.075 --> 00:11:48.118
do not will the property away
to your sons or daughters.

00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:52.701
Make sure your daughters
get their legitimate share.

00:11:52.989 --> 00:11:55.377
(Applause)

00:11:58.497 --> 00:12:05.378
You know, it reminds me
of the story of Sudha Goel

00:12:05.479 --> 00:12:09.407
because daughters need
to have control of their property,

00:12:09.407 --> 00:12:10.981
they need to feel secure,

00:12:11.534 --> 00:12:14.698
and Sudha Goel had been given a dowry.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.478
One December night,
the neighbors heard her screaming:

00:12:21.798 --> 00:12:24.430
"Bachao! Bachao! Save me! Save me!"

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.900
So they rushed and forced
their way into the flat

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.903
and found her in flames.

00:12:33.135 --> 00:12:37.250
Her mother-in-law and her husband
were simply sitting there.

00:12:38.606 --> 00:12:42.606
She said, "These people have killed me.

00:12:42.876 --> 00:12:45.858
They have taken my gold and everything."

00:12:47.621 --> 00:12:53.148
There are hundreds of such cases
in India every year.

00:12:55.343 --> 00:12:56.589
How do we do it?

00:12:56.589 --> 00:12:59.222
How do we take steps to stop this?

00:13:01.222 --> 00:13:06.404
I think that I can
summarize it in four words.

00:13:07.786 --> 00:13:10.073
First, awareness.

00:13:10.715 --> 00:13:13.127
Second, assertion.

00:13:13.599 --> 00:13:15.865
Third, attitude change.

00:13:16.357 --> 00:13:18.876
And fourth, action.

00:13:20.255 --> 00:13:22.626
So, sisters,

00:13:22.626 --> 00:13:26.617
don't be blackmailed by -
emotionally blackmailed by your brothers.

00:13:27.147 --> 00:13:30.130
Don't take dowries;
don't take after dowries.

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:31.956
Demand your inheritance.

00:13:32.636 --> 00:13:37.420
Brothers, husbands, and fathers,

00:13:37.879 --> 00:13:42.682
make sure that your daughter
gets her legitimate share.

00:13:43.581 --> 00:13:48.861
And make sure that she has
that confidence that is important for her.

00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:51.601
Do the legal thing, not the illegal.

00:13:52.773 --> 00:13:54.796
So when you look forward,

00:13:55.171 --> 00:13:57.982
make sure your daughters get
what they deserve.

00:13:58.449 --> 00:14:01.021
You should not let your daughters down,

00:14:02.206 --> 00:14:04.559
and they will not let you down.

00:14:05.773 --> 00:14:07.581
(Applause)

00:14:10.791 --> 00:14:12.914
So this is the mantra:

00:14:13.265 --> 00:14:15.585
Inheritance, not dowry.

00:14:16.061 --> 00:14:18.437
Inheritance, not dowry.

00:14:18.803 --> 00:14:24.483
Repeat it, act upon it,
and get others to act upon it as well.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:34.600
I'd like to end with an appeal
by a daughter to her parents.

00:14:35.745 --> 00:14:39.730
"Father, why do you
discriminate against me

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:42.123
when I can be as good as my brother?

00:14:42.123 --> 00:14:46.573
Mother, nurture, nourish, and educate me,

00:14:46.573 --> 00:14:50.622
and you will see
that I will not be a burden

00:14:50.622 --> 00:14:53.652
but will control my own destiny.

00:14:54.001 --> 00:14:58.098
And you will have nothing to fear
when Brother is not there.

00:14:58.098 --> 00:15:01.448
I will look after both of you
in your old age.

00:15:01.448 --> 00:15:04.606
I ask only to be treated equally.

00:15:04.606 --> 00:15:06.532
Will you not dare?

00:15:06.532 --> 00:15:09.742
So that I have the freedom to choose
and the right to care

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:13.867
and am no longer
the prisoner of my own gender,

00:15:13.867 --> 00:15:18.972
unable to resist or retaliate
against injustice.

00:15:21.075 --> 00:15:23.314
Oh Father, give me a chance.

00:15:23.314 --> 00:15:25.105
Just give me a chance.

00:15:25.253 --> 00:15:28.550
Oh Mother, break the bonds of tradition

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:33.806
and let me into the sunlight
to dance, to dance, to dance."

00:15:33.806 --> 00:15:35.606
(Applause)
