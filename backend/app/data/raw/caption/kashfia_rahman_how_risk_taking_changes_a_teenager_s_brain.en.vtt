00:00:12.542 --> 00:00:16.851
Have you ever tried
to understand a teenager?

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:18.976
It's exhausting, right?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.518
You must be puzzled by the fact
that some teens do well in school,

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:25.434
lead clubs and teams

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.809
and volunteer in their communities,

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:31.768
but they eat Tide Pods
for an online challenge,

00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:34.226
speed and text while driving,

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.250
binge drink and experiment
with illicit drugs.

00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:43.476
How can so many teens
be so smart, skilled and responsible --

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.101
and careless risk-takers at the same time?

00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:48.809
When I was 16,

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:51.518
while frequently observing
my peers in person

00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:53.684
as well as on social media,

00:00:53.708 --> 00:00:57.750
I began to wonder why so many teens
took such crazy risks.

00:00:58.583 --> 00:01:02.434
It seems like getting a certificate
from DARE class in the fifth grade

00:01:02.458 --> 00:01:03.768
can't stop them.

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:04.851
(Laughter)

00:01:04.875 --> 00:01:06.476
What was even more alarming to me

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.226
was that the more they exposed
themselves to these harmful risks,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.518
the easier it became for them
to continue taking risks.

00:01:14.542 --> 00:01:16.559
Now this confused me,

00:01:16.583 --> 00:01:19.125
but it also made me incredibly curious.

00:01:20.083 --> 00:01:21.643
So, as someone with a name

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:24.601
that literally means
"to explore knowledge,"

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:27.292
I started searching
for a scientific explanation.

00:01:28.458 --> 00:01:31.518
Now, it's no secret
that teens ages 13 to 18

00:01:31.542 --> 00:01:35.226
are more prone to risk-taking
than children or adults,

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.625
but what makes them so daring?

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:40.309
Do they suddenly become reckless,

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:43.893
or is this just a natural phase
that they're going through?

00:01:43.917 --> 00:01:46.226
Well neuroscientists
have already found evidence

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.184
that the teen brain
is still in the process of maturation --

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:52.684
and that this makes them
exceptionally poor at decision-making,

00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:55.208
causing them to fall prey
to risky behaviors.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.684
But in that case,
if the maturing brain is to blame,

00:01:59.708 --> 00:02:02.393
then why are teens
more vulnerable than children,

00:02:02.417 --> 00:02:05.601
even though their brains
are more developed than those of children?

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:09.476
Also, not all teens in the world
take risks at the same level.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.976
Are there some other underlying
or unintentional causes

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.458
driving them to risk-taking?

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:18.875
Well, this is exactly
what I decided to research.

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:23.559
So, I founded my research
on the basis of a psychological process

00:02:23.583 --> 00:02:25.518
known as "habituation,"

00:02:25.542 --> 00:02:28.625
or simply what we refer to
as "getting used to it."

00:02:29.417 --> 00:02:33.143
Habituation explains how our brains
adapt to some behaviors,

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:36.476
like lying, with repeated exposures.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.768
And this concept inspired me
to design a project

00:02:38.792 --> 00:02:41.184
to determine if the same principle

00:02:41.208 --> 00:02:46.101
could be applied to the relentless
rise of risk-taking in teenagers.

00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:49.434
So I predicted that
habituation to risk-taking

00:02:49.458 --> 00:02:53.393
may have the potential to change
the already-vulnerable teenage brain

00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:55.559
by blunting or even eradicating

00:02:55.583 --> 00:02:58.268
the negative emotions
associated with risk,

00:02:58.292 --> 00:02:59.625
like fear or guilt.

00:03:00.292 --> 00:03:03.643
I also thought because they
would feel less fearful and guilty,

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:07.167
this desensitization would lead them
to even more risk-taking.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.351
In short, I wanted to conduct
a research study

00:03:10.375 --> 00:03:12.934
to answer one big question:

00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.559
Why do teens keep making
outrageous choices

00:03:15.583 --> 00:03:18.375
that are harmful
to their health and well-being?

00:03:19.292 --> 00:03:22.059
But there was one big obstacle in my way.

00:03:22.083 --> 00:03:24.018
To investigate this problem,

00:03:24.042 --> 00:03:26.726
I needed teenagers to experiment on,

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.476
laboratories and devices
to measure their brain activity,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.059
and teachers or professors to supervise me
and guide me along the way.

00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:36.625
I needed resources.

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:40.434
But, you see, I attended
a high school in South Dakota

00:03:40.458 --> 00:03:44.184
with limited opportunity
for scientific exploration.

00:03:44.208 --> 00:03:46.309
My school had athletics,

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:50.101
band, choir, debate and other clubs,

00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:53.434
but there were no STEM programs
or research mentors.

00:03:53.458 --> 00:03:55.059
And the notion of high schoolers

00:03:55.083 --> 00:03:59.792
doing research or participating
in a science fair was completely foreign.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.643
Simply put, I didn't exactly
have the ingredients

00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:05.875
to make a chef-worthy dish.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.184
And these obstacles were frustrating,

00:04:09.208 --> 00:04:12.184
but I was also a stubborn teenager.

00:04:12.208 --> 00:04:14.726
And as the daughter
of Bangladeshi immigrants

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.851
and one of just a handful
of Muslim students

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:19.059
in my high school in South Dakota,

00:04:19.083 --> 00:04:21.309
I often struggled to fit in.

00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:25.768
And I wanted to be someone
with something to contribute to society,

00:04:25.792 --> 00:04:28.559
not just be deemed
the scarf-wearing brown girl

00:04:28.583 --> 00:04:30.791
who was an anomaly
in my homogenous hometown.

00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:33.434
I hoped that by doing this research,

00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:34.893
I could establish this

00:04:34.917 --> 00:04:39.309
and how valuable scientific exploration
could be for kids like me

00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:41.833
who didn't necessarily
find their niche elsewhere.

00:04:42.833 --> 00:04:45.351
So with limited research opportunities,

00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:50.518
inventiveness allowed me to overcome
seemingly impossible obstacles.

00:04:50.542 --> 00:04:54.726
I became more creative in working
with a variety of methodologies,

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.309
materials and subjects.

00:04:57.333 --> 00:05:00.476
I transformed my unassuming school library

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.268
into a laboratory

00:05:02.292 --> 00:05:04.559
and my peers into lab rats.

00:05:04.583 --> 00:05:05.768
(Laughter)

00:05:05.792 --> 00:05:08.559
My enthusiastic geography teacher,

00:05:08.583 --> 00:05:11.726
who also happens to be
my school's football coach,

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.726
ended up as my cheerleader,

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.309
becoming my mentor
to sign necessary paperwork.

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:19.393
And when it became logistically impossible

00:05:19.417 --> 00:05:22.518
to use a laboratory
electroencephalography,

00:05:22.542 --> 00:05:23.851
or EEG,

00:05:23.875 --> 00:05:28.101
which are those electrode devices
used to measure emotional responses,

00:05:28.125 --> 00:05:31.268
I bought a portable EEG headset
with my own money,

00:05:31.292 --> 00:05:32.934
instead of buying the new iPhone X

00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:35.250
that a lot of kids my age
were saving up for.

00:05:35.917 --> 00:05:38.434
So finally I started the research

00:05:38.458 --> 00:05:41.792
with 86 students,
ages 13 to 18, from my high school.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.309
Using the computer cubicles
in my school library,

00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:48.893
I had them complete a computerized
decision-making simulation

00:05:48.917 --> 00:05:53.101
to measure their risk-taking behaviors
comparable to ones in the real world,

00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:56.893
like alcohol use, drug use and gambling.

00:05:56.917 --> 00:05:58.726
Wearing the EEG headset,

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.684
the students completed the test
12 times over three days

00:06:02.708 --> 00:06:05.559
to mimic repeated risk exposures.

00:06:05.583 --> 00:06:08.059
A control panel on the EEG headset

00:06:08.083 --> 00:06:10.726
measured their various
emotional responses:

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.976
like attention, interest,
excitement, frustration,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.875
guilt, stress levels and relaxation.

00:06:17.542 --> 00:06:19.101
They also rated their emotions

00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:22.351
on well-validated
emotion-measuring scales.

00:06:22.375 --> 00:06:25.226
This meant that I had measured
the process of habituation

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.250
and its effects on decision-making.

00:06:28.167 --> 00:06:31.268
And it took 29 days
to complete this research.

00:06:31.292 --> 00:06:34.518
And with months of frantically
drafting proposals,

00:06:34.542 --> 00:06:39.018
meticulously computing data
in a caffeinated daze at 2am,

00:06:39.042 --> 00:06:40.917
I was able to finalize my results.

00:06:41.708 --> 00:06:44.684
And the results showed
that habituation to risk-taking

00:06:44.708 --> 00:06:48.851
could actually change a teen's brain
by altering their emotional levels,

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:50.500
causing greater risk-taking.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.893
The students' emotions
that were normally associated with risks,

00:06:54.917 --> 00:06:58.309
like fear, stress, guilt and nervousness,

00:06:58.333 --> 00:06:59.976
as well as attention,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.250
were high when they were first
exposed to the risk simulator.

00:07:04.167 --> 00:07:07.643
This curbed their temptations
and enforced self-control,

00:07:07.667 --> 00:07:10.000
which prevented them
from taking more risks.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.684
However, the more they were exposed
to the risks through the simulator,

00:07:14.708 --> 00:07:17.583
the less fearful, guilty
and stressed they became.

00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:20.226
This caused a situation

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.226
in which they were no longer able to feel

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.851
the brain's natural
fear and caution instincts.

00:07:25.875 --> 00:07:30.768
And also, because they are teenagers
and their brains are still underdeveloped,

00:07:30.792 --> 00:07:34.542
they became more interested and excited
in thrill-seeking behaviors.

00:07:35.708 --> 00:07:37.167
So what were the consequences?

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.309
They lacked self-control
for logical decision-making,

00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:43.059
took greater risks

00:07:43.083 --> 00:07:45.184
and made more harmful choices.

00:07:45.208 --> 00:07:48.726
So the developing brain alone
isn't to blame.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.434
The process of habituation
also plays a key role in risk-taking

00:07:52.458 --> 00:07:54.476
and risk escalation.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.893
Although a teen's willingness to seek risk

00:07:56.917 --> 00:08:00.143
is largely a result of the structural
and functional changes

00:08:00.167 --> 00:08:02.934
associated with their developing brains,

00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:06.184
the dangerous part
that my research was able to highlight

00:08:06.208 --> 00:08:08.226
was that a habituation to risks

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:10.934
can actually physically
change a teen's brain

00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.458
and cause greater risk-taking.

00:08:13.333 --> 00:08:16.309
So it's the combination
of the immature teen brain

00:08:16.333 --> 00:08:18.309
and the impact of habituation

00:08:18.333 --> 00:08:21.708
that is like a perfect storm
to create more damaging effects.

00:08:22.917 --> 00:08:26.518
And this research can help parents
and the general public

00:08:26.542 --> 00:08:29.684
understand that teens aren't just
willfully ignoring warnings

00:08:29.708 --> 00:08:34.851
or simply defying parents by engaging
in increasingly more dangerous behavior.

00:08:34.875 --> 00:08:38.893
The biggest hurdle they're facing
is their habituation to risks:

00:08:38.917 --> 00:08:43.268
all the physical, detectable
and emotional functional changes

00:08:43.292 --> 00:08:47.625
that drive and control and influence
their over-the-top risk-taking.

00:08:48.667 --> 00:08:52.393
So yes, we need policies
that provide safer environments

00:08:52.417 --> 00:08:55.018
and limit exposures to high risks,

00:08:55.042 --> 00:08:58.292
but we also need policies
that reflect this insight.

00:08:59.458 --> 00:09:02.476
These results are
a wake-up call for teens, too.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.976
It shows them that the natural
and necessary fear and guilt

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.851
that protect them from unsafe situations

00:09:08.875 --> 00:09:12.667
actually become numb when they
repeatedly choose risky behaviors.

00:09:13.917 --> 00:09:18.893
So with this hope to share my findings
with fellow teenagers and scientists,

00:09:18.917 --> 00:09:20.226
I took my research

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.601
to the Intel International
Science and Engineering Fair, or ISEF,

00:09:24.625 --> 00:09:26.976
a culmination of over 1,800 students

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.643
from 75 countries,
regions and territories,

00:09:30.667 --> 00:09:34.393
who showcase their cutting-edge
research and inventions.

00:09:34.417 --> 00:09:36.893
It's like the Olympics of science fair.

00:09:36.917 --> 00:09:38.101
(Laughter)

00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:43.268
There, I was able to present my research
to experts in neuroscience and psychology

00:09:43.292 --> 00:09:45.809
and garner valuable feedback.

00:09:45.833 --> 00:09:48.809
But perhaps the most
memorable moment of the week

00:09:48.833 --> 00:09:51.976
was when the booming speakers
suddenly uttered my name

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.542
during the awards ceremony.

00:09:54.125 --> 00:09:57.434
I was in such disbelief
that I questioned myself:

00:09:57.458 --> 00:10:00.101
Was this just another "La La Land" blunder

00:10:00.125 --> 00:10:01.393
like at the Oscars?

00:10:01.417 --> 00:10:02.851
(Laughter)

00:10:02.875 --> 00:10:05.143
Luckily, it wasn't.

00:10:05.167 --> 00:10:07.101
I really had won first place

00:10:07.125 --> 00:10:09.643
in the category "Behavioral
and Social Sciences."

00:10:09.667 --> 00:10:14.375
(Applause)

00:10:16.042 --> 00:10:17.393
Needless to say,

00:10:17.417 --> 00:10:20.184
I was not only thrilled
to have this recognition,

00:10:20.208 --> 00:10:25.143
but also the whole experience
of science fair that validated my efforts

00:10:25.167 --> 00:10:27.268
keeps my curiosity alive

00:10:27.292 --> 00:10:29.268
and strengthens my creativity,

00:10:29.292 --> 00:10:31.917
perseverance and imagination.

00:10:32.792 --> 00:10:36.518
This still image of me
experimenting in my school library

00:10:36.542 --> 00:10:38.518
may seem ordinary,

00:10:38.542 --> 00:10:42.351
but to me, it represents
a sort of inspiration.

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:46.351
It reminds me that this process
taught me to take risks.

00:10:46.375 --> 00:10:49.476
And I know that might sound
incredibly ironic.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.434
But I took risks realizing

00:10:51.458 --> 00:10:55.518
that unforeseen opportunities
often come from risk-taking --

00:10:55.542 --> 00:10:58.684
not the hazardous,
negative type that I studied,

00:10:58.708 --> 00:11:00.059
but the good ones,

00:11:00.083 --> 00:11:02.226
the positive risks.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.976
The more risks I took,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.726
the more capable I felt of withstanding
my unconventional circumstances,

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.601
leading to more tolerance,
resilience and patience

00:11:11.625 --> 00:11:13.768
for completing my project.

00:11:13.792 --> 00:11:16.851
And these lessons
have led me to new ideas

00:11:16.875 --> 00:11:20.434
like: Is the opposite
of negative risk-taking also true?

00:11:20.458 --> 00:11:24.434
Can positive risk-taking
escalate with repeated exposures?

00:11:24.458 --> 00:11:28.643
Does positive action
build positive brain functioning?

00:11:28.667 --> 00:11:32.226
I think I just might have
my next research idea.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:38.458
