00:00:06.716 --> 00:00:10.397
The coldest materials in the world 
aren’t in Antarctica.

00:00:10.397 --> 00:00:12.521
They’re not at the top of Mount Everest

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:14.376
or buried in a glacier.

00:00:14.376 --> 00:00:15.897
They’re in physics labs:

00:00:15.897 --> 00:00:20.382
clouds of gases held just fractions
of a degree above absolute zero.

00:00:20.382 --> 00:00:25.367
That’s 395 million times colder 
than your refrigerator,

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:28.073
100 million times colder 
than liquid nitrogen,

00:00:28.073 --> 00:00:31.240
and 4 million times colder
than outer space.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.901
Temperatures this low give scientists a
window into the inner workings of matter,

00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:39.437
and allow engineers to build 
incredibly sensitive instruments

00:00:39.437 --> 00:00:41.292
that tell us more about everything

00:00:41.292 --> 00:00:43.130
from our exact position on the planet

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.135
to what’s happening in 
the farthest reaches of the universe.

00:00:46.135 --> 00:00:48.928
How do we create such 
extreme temperatures?

00:00:48.928 --> 00:00:51.989
In short, by slowing down 
moving particles.

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.951
When we’re talking about temperature,
what we’re really talking about is motion.

00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:57.716
The atoms that make up solids,

00:00:57.716 --> 00:00:58.458
liquids,

00:00:58.458 --> 00:00:59.338
and gases

00:00:59.338 --> 00:01:00.869
are moving all the time.

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:05.616
When atoms are moving more rapidly,
we perceive that matter as hot.

00:01:05.616 --> 00:01:09.147
When they’re moving more
slowly, we perceive it as cold.

00:01:09.147 --> 00:01:12.563
To make a hot object 
or gas cold in everyday life,

00:01:12.563 --> 00:01:15.960
we place it in a colder environment, 
like a refrigerator.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.498
Some of the atomic motion in the hot
object is transferred to the surroundings,

00:01:20.498 --> 00:01:22.251
and it cools down.

00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:23.788
But there’s a limit to this:

00:01:23.788 --> 00:01:27.865
even outer space is too warm
to create ultra-low temperatures.

00:01:27.865 --> 00:01:32.823
So instead, scientists figured out a way 
to slow the atoms down directly –

00:01:32.823 --> 00:01:34.204
with a laser beam.

00:01:34.204 --> 00:01:35.751
Under most circumstances,

00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:38.464
the energy in a laser beam 
heats things up.

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:40.533
But used in a very precise way,

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:44.813
the beam’s momentum can stall 
moving atoms, cooling them down.

00:01:44.813 --> 00:01:49.403
That’s what happens in a device 
called a magneto-optical trap.

00:01:49.403 --> 00:01:51.954
Atoms are injected into a vacuum chamber,

00:01:51.954 --> 00:01:55.415
and a magnetic field 
draws them towards the center.

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:58.090
A laser beam aimed 
at the middle of the chamber

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.623
is tuned to just the right frequency

00:02:00.623 --> 00:02:06.170
that an atom moving towards it will absorb
a photon of the laser beam and slow down.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.089
The slow down effect comes from
the transfer of momentum

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:11.108
between the atom and the photon.

00:02:11.108 --> 00:02:14.208
A total of six beams, 
in a perpendicular arrangement,

00:02:14.208 --> 00:02:18.375
ensure that atoms traveling 
in all directions will be intercepted.

00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:21.018
At the center, where the beams intersect,

00:02:21.018 --> 00:02:24.840
the atoms move sluggishly, 
as if trapped in a thick liquid —

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.924
an effect the researchers who invented it 
described as “optical molasses.”

00:02:29.924 --> 00:02:32.315
A magneto-optical trap like this

00:02:32.315 --> 00:02:35.405
can cool atoms down 
to just a few microkelvins —

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:38.785
about -273 degrees Celsius.

00:02:38.785 --> 00:02:41.609
This technique was developed in the 1980s,

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.913
and the scientists 
who'd contributed to it

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:47.931
won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997
for the discovery.

00:02:47.931 --> 00:02:52.751
Since then, laser cooling has been 
improved to reach even lower temperatures.

00:02:52.751 --> 00:02:55.990
But why would you want 
to cool atoms down that much?

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.786
First of all, cold atoms can make
very good detectors.

00:02:59.786 --> 00:03:01.530
With so little energy,

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.961
they’re incredibly sensitive 
to fluctuations in the environment.

00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:09.562
So they’re used in devices that find 
underground oil and mineral deposits,

00:03:09.562 --> 00:03:12.203
and they also make 
highly accurate atomic clocks,

00:03:12.203 --> 00:03:15.093
like the ones used 
in global positioning satellites.

00:03:15.093 --> 00:03:18.152
Secondly, cold atoms hold 
enormous potential

00:03:18.152 --> 00:03:20.243
for probing the frontiers of physics.

00:03:20.243 --> 00:03:22.662
Their extreme sensitivity 
makes them candidates

00:03:22.662 --> 00:03:27.300
to be used to detect gravitational waves 
in future space-based detectors.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.624
They’re also useful for the study 
of atomic and subatomic phenomena,

00:03:31.624 --> 00:03:35.894
which requires measuring incredibly 
tiny fluctuations in the energy of atoms.

00:03:35.894 --> 00:03:38.046
Those are drowned out 
at normal temperatures,

00:03:38.046 --> 00:03:41.090
when atoms speed around 
at hundreds of meters per second.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.265
Laser cooling can slow atoms to just 
a few centimeters per second—

00:03:45.265 --> 00:03:49.122
enough for the motion caused by
atomic quantum effects to become obvious.

00:03:49.122 --> 00:03:53.599
Ultracold atoms have already 
allowed scientists to study phenomena

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.150
like Bose-Einstein condensation,

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.631
in which atoms are cooled almost 
to absolute zero

00:03:59.631 --> 00:04:02.200
and become a rare new state of matter.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.791
So as researchers continue in their quest 
to understand the laws of physics

00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:07.925
and unravel the mysteries of the universe,

00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:12.161
they’ll do so with the help 
of the very coldest atoms in it.
