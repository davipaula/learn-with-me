00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:18.021
Oh, there's a lot of it.

00:00:18.532 --> 00:00:20.882
This is seaweed.

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.455
It's pretty humble stuff.

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:30.852
But it does have
some remarkable qualities.

00:00:31.328 --> 00:00:33.939
For one, it grows really fast.

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:38.450
So the carbon that is part
of that seaweed,

00:00:38.474 --> 00:00:39.991
just a few weeks ago,

00:00:40.015 --> 00:00:43.577
was floating in the atmosphere
as atmospheric CO2,

00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:47.315
driving all the adverse consequences
of climate change.

00:00:48.244 --> 00:00:51.861
For the moment, it's locked
safely away in the seaweed,

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:53.303
but when that seaweed rots --

00:00:53.327 --> 00:00:56.441
and by the smell of it,
it's not far away --

00:00:56.465 --> 00:01:00.820
when it rots, that CO2 will be released
back to the atmosphere.

00:01:01.482 --> 00:01:05.393
Wouldn't it be fantastic
if we could find a way

00:01:05.417 --> 00:01:09.315
of keeping that CO2 locked up long-term,

00:01:09.339 --> 00:01:14.445
and thereby significantly contributing
to solving the climate problem?

00:01:15.684 --> 00:01:18.446
What I'm talking about here is drawdown.

00:01:18.803 --> 00:01:22.133
It's now become the other half
of the climate challenge.

00:01:22.157 --> 00:01:26.109
And that's because
we have delayed so long,

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:28.006
in terms of addressing climate change,

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.696
that we now have to do two very big
and very difficult things at once.

00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:36.481
We have to cut our emissions
and clean our energy supply

00:01:36.505 --> 00:01:39.854
at the same time that we draw
significant volumes

00:01:39.878 --> 00:01:42.625
of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.339
If we don't do that, about 25 percent
of the CO2 we put in the air

00:01:47.363 --> 00:01:50.496
will remain there,
by human standards, forever.

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:52.119
So we have to act.

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:57.903
This is really a new phase
in addressing the climate crisis

00:01:57.927 --> 00:01:59.883
and it demands new thinking.

00:02:00.221 --> 00:02:04.451
So, ideas like carbon offsets
really don't make sense

00:02:04.475 --> 00:02:05.641
in the modern era.

00:02:05.665 --> 00:02:07.435
You know, when you offset something,

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.166
you say, "I'll permit myself to put
some greenhouse gas into the atmosphere,

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.468
but then I'll offset it
by drawing it down."

00:02:13.492 --> 00:02:15.769
When you've got to both cut your emissions

00:02:15.793 --> 00:02:17.412
and draw down CO2,

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:19.587
that thinking doesn't make sense anymore.

00:02:19.982 --> 00:02:21.863
And when we're talking about drawdown,

00:02:21.887 --> 00:02:26.776
we're talking about putting large volumes
of greenhouses gases, particularly CO2,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.585
out of circulation.

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:31.236
And to do that, we need a carbon price.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.942
We need a significant price
that we'll pay for that service

00:02:34.966 --> 00:02:36.833
that we'll all benefit from.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.484
We've made almost no progress so far

00:02:40.508 --> 00:02:42.691
with the second half
of the climate challenge.

00:02:42.715 --> 00:02:44.848
It's not on most people's radar.

00:02:45.722 --> 00:02:50.060
And, you know, I must say,
at times, I hear people saying,

00:02:50.084 --> 00:02:53.839
"I've lost hope that we can do anything
about the climate crisis."

00:02:53.863 --> 00:02:56.842
And look, I've had my sleepless
nights too, I can tell you.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.432
But I'm here today as an ambassador
for this humble weed, seaweed.

00:03:02.972 --> 00:03:06.575
I think it has the potential

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.645
to be a big part of addressing
the challenge of climate change

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.935
and a big part of our future.

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:18.486
Now, what the scientists are telling us
we need to do over the next 80-odd years

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.034
to the end of this century,

00:03:20.058 --> 00:03:22.691
is to cut our greenhouse gas emissions

00:03:22.715 --> 00:03:25.834
by three percent every year,

00:03:25.858 --> 00:03:30.061
and draw three gigatons of CO2
out of the atmosphere every year.

00:03:30.366 --> 00:03:33.934
Those numbers are so large
that they baffle us.

00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:36.450
But that's what the scientists
tell us we need to do.

00:03:37.157 --> 00:03:39.164
I really hate showing this graph,

00:03:39.188 --> 00:03:41.339
but I'm sorry, I have to do it.

00:03:41.363 --> 00:03:44.316
It is very eloquent
in terms of telling the story

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.141
of my personal failure

00:03:46.165 --> 00:03:49.371
in terms of all the advocacy I've done
in climate change work

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:52.571
and in fact, our collective failure
to address climate change.

00:03:52.958 --> 00:03:55.258
You can see our trajectory there

00:03:55.282 --> 00:03:58.283
in terms of warming
and greenhouse gas concentrations.

00:03:58.307 --> 00:04:02.014
You can see all of the great
scientific announcements that we've made,

00:04:02.038 --> 00:04:04.736
saying how much danger
we face with climate change.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.938
You can see the political meetings.

00:04:06.962 --> 00:04:09.875
None of it has changed the trajectory.

00:04:10.344 --> 00:04:12.924
And this is why we need new thinking,

00:04:12.948 --> 00:04:15.074
we need a new approach.

00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:21.786
So how might we go about drawing down
greenhouse gases at a large scale?

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.128
There's really only two ways of doing it,

00:04:25.152 --> 00:04:28.428
and I've done a very deep dive
into drawdown.

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:31.906
And I'll preempt my --

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.141
And I would say this stuff comes up
smelling like roses at the end of the day.

00:04:37.165 --> 00:04:38.989
It does, it's one of the best options,

00:04:39.013 --> 00:04:41.660
but there are many, many possibilities.

00:04:42.442 --> 00:04:45.625
There are chemical pathways
and biological pathways.

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:48.553
So two ways, really,
of getting the job done.

00:04:48.577 --> 00:04:50.744
The biological pathways are fantastic

00:04:50.768 --> 00:04:54.514
because the energy source
that's needed to drive them, the sun,

00:04:54.538 --> 00:04:55.958
is effectively free.

00:04:55.982 --> 00:04:59.022
We use the sun to drive
photosynthesis in plants,

00:04:59.046 --> 00:05:01.593
break apart that CO2
and capture the carbon.

00:05:01.617 --> 00:05:03.447
There are also chemical pathways.

00:05:03.471 --> 00:05:06.235
They sound ominous, but actually,
they're not bad at all.

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.672
The difficulty they face is
that we have to actually pay

00:05:09.696 --> 00:05:11.871
for the energy
that's required to do the job

00:05:11.895 --> 00:05:13.736
or pay to facilitate that energy.

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:17.458
Direct air capture is a great example
of a chemical pathway,

00:05:17.482 --> 00:05:20.903
and people are using that right now
to take CO2 out of the atmosphere

00:05:20.927 --> 00:05:23.926
and manufacture biofuels
or manufacture plastics.

00:05:24.498 --> 00:05:26.189
Great progress is being made,

00:05:26.213 --> 00:05:28.029
but it will be many decades

00:05:28.053 --> 00:05:33.116
before those chemical pathways
are drawing down a gigaton of CO2 a year.

00:05:33.489 --> 00:05:36.387
The biological pathways offer us
a lot more hope, I think,

00:05:36.411 --> 00:05:37.611
in the short term.

00:05:38.061 --> 00:05:42.045
You've probably heard
about reforestation, planting trees,

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:44.490
as a solution to the climate problem.

00:05:44.514 --> 00:05:46.054
You know, it's a fair question:

00:05:46.078 --> 00:05:49.347
Can we plant our way out
of this problem by using trees?

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.609
I'm skeptical about that
for a number of reasons.

00:05:52.633 --> 00:05:55.006
One is just the scale of the problem.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.053
All trees start as seeds,
little tiny things,

00:05:58.077 --> 00:06:00.192
and it's many decades
before they've reached

00:06:00.216 --> 00:06:02.942
their full carbon-capture potential.

00:06:02.966 --> 00:06:04.117
And secondly,

00:06:04.141 --> 00:06:08.014
if you look at the land surface,
you see that it's so heavily utilized.

00:06:08.038 --> 00:06:11.756
We get our food from it,
we get our forestry products from it,

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.760
biodiversity protection
and water and everything else.

00:06:14.784 --> 00:06:17.862
To expect that we'll find enough space
to deal with this problem,

00:06:17.886 --> 00:06:20.450
I think is going to be quite problematic.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.315
But if we look offshore,

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:26.688
wee see a solution where there's already
an existing industry,

00:06:26.712 --> 00:06:28.958
and where there's a clearer way forward.

00:06:28.982 --> 00:06:32.355
The oceans cover
about 70 percent of our planet.

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:35.856
They play a really big role
in regulating our climate,

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.704
and if we can enhance
the growth of seaweed in them,

00:06:38.728 --> 00:06:42.387
we can use them, I think,
to develop a climate-altering crop.

00:06:43.347 --> 00:06:45.458
There are so many
different kinds of seaweed,

00:06:45.482 --> 00:06:48.125
there's unbelievable
genetic diversity in seaweed,

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:49.395
and they're very ancient;

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:53.276
they were some of the first
multicellular organisms ever to evolve.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.998
People are using special
kinds of seaweed now

00:06:56.022 --> 00:06:57.213
for particular purposes,

00:06:57.237 --> 00:07:00.998
like developing very high-quality
pharmaceutical products.

00:07:01.022 --> 00:07:04.085
But you can also use seaweed
to take a seaweed bath,

00:07:04.109 --> 00:07:05.982
it's supposed to be good for your skin;

00:07:06.006 --> 00:07:08.156
I can't testify to that,
but you can do it.

00:07:08.815 --> 00:07:11.848
The scalability is the big thing
about seaweed farming.

00:07:11.872 --> 00:07:15.920
You know, if we could cover
nine percent of the world's ocean

00:07:15.944 --> 00:07:17.452
in seaweed farms,

00:07:17.476 --> 00:07:20.585
we could draw down the equivalent
of all of the greenhouse gases

00:07:20.609 --> 00:07:22.102
we put up in any one year,

00:07:22.126 --> 00:07:23.831
more than 50 gigatons.

00:07:24.212 --> 00:07:26.807
Now, I thought that was fantastic
when I first read it,

00:07:26.831 --> 00:07:30.687
but I thought I'd better calculate how big
nine percent of the world's oceans is.

00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:33.163
It turns out, it's about
four and a half Australias,

00:07:33.187 --> 00:07:34.437
the place I live in.

00:07:34.461 --> 00:07:36.573
And how close are we
to that at the moment?

00:07:36.597 --> 00:07:40.617
How many ocean-going seaweed farms
do we actually have out there?

00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:41.792
Zero.

00:07:41.816 --> 00:07:45.449
But we do have some prototypes,
and therein lies some hope.

00:07:45.473 --> 00:07:50.346
This little drawing here of a seaweed farm
that's currently under construction

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.895
tells you some very interesting
things about seaweed.

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:55.029
You can see the seaweed
growing on that rack,

00:07:55.053 --> 00:07:57.117
25 meters down in the ocean there.

00:07:57.141 --> 00:08:00.626
It's really different
from anything you see on land.

00:08:00.928 --> 00:08:04.666
And the reason being that, you know,
seaweed is not like trees,

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.617
it doesn't have nonproductive parts

00:08:07.641 --> 00:08:10.641
like roots and trunks
and branches and bark.

00:08:10.966 --> 00:08:14.109
The whole of the plant
is pretty much photosynthetic,

00:08:14.133 --> 00:08:15.458
so it grows fast.

00:08:15.482 --> 00:08:18.085
Seaweed can grow a meter a day.

00:08:18.553 --> 00:08:21.342
And how do we sequester the carbon?

00:08:21.366 --> 00:08:23.276
Again, it's very different from on land.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:26.077
All you need to do
is cut that seaweed off --

00:08:26.101 --> 00:08:27.688
drifts into the ocean abyss,

00:08:27.712 --> 00:08:29.307
Once it's down a kilometer,

00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:33.625
the carbon in that seaweed is effectively
out of the atmospheric system

00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:35.382
for centuries or millennia.

00:08:35.853 --> 00:08:37.314
Whereas if you plant a forest,

00:08:37.338 --> 00:08:40.138
you've got to worry
about forest fires, bugs, etc.,

00:08:40.162 --> 00:08:42.118
releasing that carbon.

00:08:42.932 --> 00:08:44.439
The key to this farm, though,

00:08:44.463 --> 00:08:48.006
is that little pipe
going down into the depths.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:52.315
You know, the mid-ocean is basically
a vast biological desert.

00:08:52.339 --> 00:08:54.990
There's no nutrients there
that were used up long ago.

00:08:55.014 --> 00:08:57.077
But just 500 meters down,

00:08:57.101 --> 00:08:59.768
there is cool, very nutrient-rich water.

00:09:00.173 --> 00:09:03.052
And with just a little bit
of clean, renewable energy,

00:09:03.076 --> 00:09:04.791
you can pump that water up

00:09:04.815 --> 00:09:09.042
and use the nutrients in it
to irrigate your seaweed crop.

00:09:09.532 --> 00:09:14.769
So I think this really has
so many benefits.

00:09:14.793 --> 00:09:18.653
It's changing a biological desert,

00:09:18.677 --> 00:09:19.828
the mid-ocean,

00:09:19.852 --> 00:09:23.767
into a productive, maybe even
planet-saving solution.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.615
So what could go wrong?

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:30.111
Well, anything we're talking
about at this scale

00:09:30.135 --> 00:09:32.670
involves a planetary-scale intervention.

00:09:32.694 --> 00:09:34.482
And we have to be very careful.

00:09:34.506 --> 00:09:36.555
I think that piles of stinking seaweed

00:09:36.579 --> 00:09:38.982
are probably going to be
the least of our problems.

00:09:39.006 --> 00:09:41.307
There's other unforeseen things
that will happen.

00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:44.402
One of the things that really worries me,
when I talk about this,

00:09:44.426 --> 00:09:47.323
is the fate of biodiversity
in the deep ocean.

00:09:47.347 --> 00:09:50.132
If we are putting gigatons of seaweed
into the deep ocean,

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:51.806
we're affecting life down there.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.532
The good news is that we know

00:09:53.556 --> 00:09:56.707
that a lot of seaweed
already reaches the deep ocean,

00:09:56.731 --> 00:09:59.747
after storms or through submarine canyons.

00:09:59.771 --> 00:10:02.286
So we're not talking
about a novel process here;

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.393
we are talking about
enhancing a natural process.

00:10:07.552 --> 00:10:09.242
And we'll learn as we go.

00:10:09.266 --> 00:10:13.290
I mean, it may be that these ocean-going
seaweed farms will need to be mobile,

00:10:13.314 --> 00:10:16.113
to distribute the seaweed
across vast areas of the ocean,

00:10:16.137 --> 00:10:19.306
rather than creating
a big stinking pile in one place.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.304
It may be that we'll need
to char the seaweed --

00:10:23.328 --> 00:10:26.734
so create a sort of an inert,
mineral biochar

00:10:26.758 --> 00:10:28.839
before we dispatch it into the deep.

00:10:28.863 --> 00:10:31.204
We won't know until we start the process,

00:10:31.228 --> 00:10:34.109
and we will learn effectively by doing.

00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:38.164
I just want to take you
to contemporary seaweed farming.

00:10:38.188 --> 00:10:39.339
It's a big business --

00:10:39.363 --> 00:10:41.704
it's a six-billion-dollar-a-year business.

00:10:41.728 --> 00:10:43.606
These seaweed farms off South Korea --

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:46.081
you can see them from space,
they are huge.

00:10:46.105 --> 00:10:48.930
And they're increasingly
not just seaweed farms.

00:10:48.954 --> 00:10:53.168
What people are doing in places like this
is something called ocean permaculture.

00:10:53.192 --> 00:10:55.041
And in ocean permaculture,

00:10:55.065 --> 00:10:58.558
you grow fish, shellfish
and seaweed all together.

00:10:58.582 --> 00:11:00.505
And the reason it works so well

00:11:00.529 --> 00:11:04.330
is that the seaweed
makes the seawater less acid.

00:11:04.354 --> 00:11:08.418
It provides an ideal environment
for growing marine protein.

00:11:08.442 --> 00:11:10.693
If we covered nine percent
of the world's oceans

00:11:10.717 --> 00:11:12.236
in ocean permaculture,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.558
we would be producing enough protein
in the form of fish and shellfish

00:11:16.582 --> 00:11:20.077
to give every person
in a population of 10 billion

00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:24.353
200 kilograms of high-quality
protein per year.

00:11:24.853 --> 00:11:26.900
So, we've got a multipotent solution here.

00:11:26.924 --> 00:11:29.448
We can address climate change,
we can feed the world,

00:11:29.472 --> 00:11:31.339
we can deacidify the oceans.

00:11:32.345 --> 00:11:34.983
The economics of all of this
is going to be challenging.

00:11:35.007 --> 00:11:38.276
We'll be investing many,
many billions of dollars

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.570
into these solutions,

00:11:39.594 --> 00:11:42.520
and they will take decades
to get to the gigaton scale.

00:11:42.951 --> 00:11:46.146
The reason that I'm convinced
that this is going to happen

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.987
is that unless we get the gas
out of the air,

00:11:49.011 --> 00:11:51.852
it is going to keep driving
adverse consequences.

00:11:51.876 --> 00:11:53.701
It will flood our cities,

00:11:53.725 --> 00:11:55.212
it will deprive us of food,

00:11:55.236 --> 00:11:58.547
it will cause all sorts of civil unrest.

00:11:58.571 --> 00:12:01.801
So anyone who's got a solution
to dealing with this problem

00:12:01.825 --> 00:12:03.225
has a valuable asset.

00:12:03.587 --> 00:12:06.380
And already, as I've explained,

00:12:06.404 --> 00:12:11.231
ocean permaculture is well on the road
to being economically sustainable.

00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:14.938
You know, in the next 30 years,

00:12:14.962 --> 00:12:19.239
we have to go from being
a carbon-emitting economy

00:12:19.263 --> 00:12:21.263
to a carbon-absorbing economy.

00:12:21.861 --> 00:12:24.328
And that doesn't seem like very long.

00:12:24.766 --> 00:12:28.527
But half of the greenhouse gases
that we've put into the atmosphere,

00:12:28.551 --> 00:12:31.257
we've put there in the last 30 years.

00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:32.810
My argument is,

00:12:32.834 --> 00:12:35.612
if we can put the gas in in 30 years,

00:12:35.636 --> 00:12:38.437
we can pull it out in 30 years.

00:12:38.461 --> 00:12:41.120
And if you doubt how much
can be done over 30 years,

00:12:41.144 --> 00:12:44.708
just cast your mind back
a century, to 1919,

00:12:44.732 --> 00:12:46.621
compare it with 1950.

00:12:46.645 --> 00:12:49.171
Now, in 1919, here in Edinburgh,

00:12:49.195 --> 00:12:52.193
you might have seen
a canvas and wood biplane.

00:12:52.217 --> 00:12:54.629
Thirty years later,
you'd be seeing jet aircraft.

00:12:55.109 --> 00:12:58.069
Transport in the street
were horses in 1919.

00:12:58.093 --> 00:13:00.792
By 1950, they're motor vehicles.

00:13:01.093 --> 00:13:03.276
1919, we had gun powder;

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.714
1950, we had nuclear power.

00:13:06.038 --> 00:13:08.958
We can do a lot in a short period of time.

00:13:08.982 --> 00:13:12.454
But it all depends upon us believing
that we can find a solution.

00:13:13.577 --> 00:13:16.975
Now what I would love to do
is bring together all of the people

00:13:16.999 --> 00:13:19.228
with knowledge in this space.

00:13:19.252 --> 00:13:22.204
The engineers who know
how to build structures offshore,

00:13:22.228 --> 00:13:24.410
the seaweed farmers, the financiers,

00:13:24.434 --> 00:13:25.831
the government regulators,

00:13:25.855 --> 00:13:28.743
the people who understand
how things are done.

00:13:29.165 --> 00:13:30.776
And chart a way forward,

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.607
say: How do we go from the existing
six-billion-dollar-a-year,

00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:36.631
inshore seaweed industry,

00:13:36.655 --> 00:13:40.514
to this new form of industry,
which has got so much potential,

00:13:40.538 --> 00:13:43.604
but will require large
amounts of investment?

00:13:45.077 --> 00:13:47.252
I'm not a betting man, you know.

00:13:47.276 --> 00:13:48.545
But if I were,

00:13:48.569 --> 00:13:50.852
I'll tell you, my money
would be on that stuff,

00:13:50.876 --> 00:13:52.236
it would be on seaweed.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.698
It's my hero.

00:13:53.722 --> 00:13:54.873
Thank you.

00:13:54.897 --> 00:13:58.865
(Applause)
