00:00:12.652 --> 00:00:17.848
I could fit all movies ever made
inside of this tube.

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:20.125
If you can't see it,
that's kind of the point.

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:21.165
(Laughter)

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.432
Before we understand how this is possible,

00:00:24.456 --> 00:00:28.202
it's important to understand
the value of this feat.

00:00:29.075 --> 00:00:31.341
All of our thoughts
and actions these days,

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:33.351
through photos and videos --

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:35.254
even our fitness activities --

00:00:35.278 --> 00:00:37.411
are stored as digital data.

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:39.626
Aside from running out of space

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.801
on our phones,

00:00:40.825 --> 00:00:43.139
we rarely think about
our digital footprint.

00:00:43.536 --> 00:00:47.064
But humanity has collectively
generated more data

00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:48.961
in the last few years

00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:51.515
than all of preceding human history.

00:00:51.902 --> 00:00:54.800
Big data has become a big problem.

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.046
Digital storage is really expensive,

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.793
and none of these devices that we have
really stand the test of time.

00:01:03.256 --> 00:01:07.006
There's this nonprofit website
called the Internet Archive.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.675
In addition to free books and movies,

00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:14.063
you can access web pages
as far back as 1996.

00:01:14.087 --> 00:01:15.771
Now, this is very tempting,

00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:21.784
but I decided to go back and look at
the TED website's very humble beginnings.

00:01:21.808 --> 00:01:25.720
As you can see, it's changed
quite a bit in the last 30 years.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.544
So this led me to the first-ever TED,

00:01:29.568 --> 00:01:31.748
back in 1984,

00:01:31.772 --> 00:01:34.297
and it just so happened
to be a Sony executive

00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:37.379
explaining how a compact disk works.

00:01:37.403 --> 00:01:38.482
(Laughter)

00:01:38.506 --> 00:01:42.770
Now, it's really incredible
to be able to go back in time

00:01:42.794 --> 00:01:45.080
and access this moment.

00:01:45.548 --> 00:01:50.911
It's also really fascinating
that after 30 years, after that first TED,

00:01:50.935 --> 00:01:53.714
we're still talking about digital storage.

00:01:54.827 --> 00:01:57.614
Now, if we look back another 30 years,

00:01:57.638 --> 00:02:00.823
IBM released the first-ever hard drive

00:02:00.847 --> 00:02:02.974
back in 1956.

00:02:02.998 --> 00:02:07.195
Here it is being loaded for shipping
in front of a small audience.

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.679
It held the equivalent of one MP3 song

00:02:11.354 --> 00:02:13.358
and weighed over one ton.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.751
At 10,000 dollars a megabyte,

00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:20.362
I don't think anyone in this room
would be interested in buying this thing,

00:02:20.386 --> 00:02:22.146
except maybe as a collector's item.

00:02:22.817 --> 00:02:25.805
But it's the best we could do at the time.

00:02:26.832 --> 00:02:29.948
We've come such a long way
in data storage.

00:02:29.972 --> 00:02:32.870
Devices have evolved dramatically.

00:02:32.894 --> 00:02:36.918
But all media eventually wear out
or become obsolete.

00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:41.818
If someone handed you a floppy drive today
to back up your presentation,

00:02:41.842 --> 00:02:44.782
you'd probably look at them
kind of strange, maybe laugh,

00:02:44.806 --> 00:02:47.221
but you'd have no way
to use the damn thing.

00:02:47.854 --> 00:02:50.995
These devices can no longer meet
our storage needs,

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.721
although some of them can be repurposed.

00:02:54.682 --> 00:02:57.791
All technology eventually dies or is lost,

00:02:57.815 --> 00:02:59.666
along with our data,

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.230
all of our memories.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.326
There's this illusion that
the storage problem has been solved,

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.843
but really, we all just externalize it.

00:03:08.867 --> 00:03:12.344
We don't worry about storing
our emails and our photos.

00:03:12.368 --> 00:03:14.091
They're just in the cloud.

00:03:15.231 --> 00:03:18.168
But behind the scenes,
storage is problematic.

00:03:18.192 --> 00:03:22.172
After all, the cloud is just
a lot of hard drives.

00:03:23.156 --> 00:03:27.196
Now, most digital data,
we could argue, is not really critical.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.343
Surely, we could just delete it.

00:03:29.957 --> 00:03:33.492
But how can we really know
what's important today?

00:03:34.132 --> 00:03:36.668
We've learned so much about human history

00:03:36.692 --> 00:03:39.518
from drawings and writings in caves,

00:03:39.542 --> 00:03:41.156
from stone tablets.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.577
We've deciphered languages
from the Rosetta Stone.

00:03:45.841 --> 00:03:49.450
You know, we'll never really have
the whole story, though.

00:03:49.474 --> 00:03:51.368
Our data is our story,

00:03:51.392 --> 00:03:53.127
even more so today.

00:03:53.508 --> 00:03:56.769
We won't have our record
recorded on stone tablets.

00:03:57.692 --> 00:04:00.390
But we don't have to choose
what is important now.

00:04:00.847 --> 00:04:02.740
There's a way to store it all.

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.117
It turns out that there's
a solution that's been around

00:04:06.141 --> 00:04:08.584
for a few billion years,

00:04:08.608 --> 00:04:10.448
and it's actually in this tube.

00:04:12.044 --> 00:04:15.766
DNA is nature's oldest storage device.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.161
After all, it contains
all the information necessary

00:04:19.185 --> 00:04:22.015
to build and maintain a human being.

00:04:22.583 --> 00:04:24.787
But what makes DNA so great?

00:04:25.493 --> 00:04:27.249
Well, let's take our own genome

00:04:27.273 --> 00:04:28.833
as an example.

00:04:28.857 --> 00:04:33.627
If we were to print out
all three billion A's, T's, C's and G's

00:04:33.651 --> 00:04:37.282
on a standard font, standard format,

00:04:37.306 --> 00:04:40.046
and then we were
to stack all of those papers,

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.730
it would be about 130 meters high,

00:04:42.754 --> 00:04:46.413
somewhere between the Statue of Liberty
and the Washington Monument.

00:04:46.437 --> 00:04:48.884
Now, if we converted
all those A's, T's, C's and G's

00:04:48.898 --> 00:04:51.454
to digital data, to zeroes and ones,

00:04:51.478 --> 00:04:53.247
it would total a few gigs.

00:04:53.786 --> 00:04:56.125
And that's in each cell of our body.

00:04:56.516 --> 00:04:59.354
We have more than 30 trillion cells.

00:04:59.757 --> 00:05:01.257
You get the idea:

00:05:01.281 --> 00:05:05.956
DNA can store a ton of information
in a minuscule space.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.445
DNA is also very durable,

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:12.303
and it doesn't even require
electricity to store it.

00:05:12.327 --> 00:05:16.603
We know this because scientists
have recovered DNA from ancient humans

00:05:16.627 --> 00:05:19.379
that lived hundreds
of thousands of years ago.

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:22.366
One of those is Ötzi the Iceman.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.073
Turns out, he's Austrian.

00:05:24.097 --> 00:05:25.697
(Laughter)

00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:27.351
He was found high, well-preserved,

00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:30.189
in the mountains
between Italy and Austria,

00:05:30.213 --> 00:05:34.197
and it turns out that he has living
genetic relatives here in Austria today.

00:05:34.221 --> 00:05:36.563
So one of you could be a cousin of Ötzi.

00:05:36.587 --> 00:05:37.642
(Laughter)

00:05:38.043 --> 00:05:41.896
The point is that we have a better chance
of recovering information

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.145
from an ancient human

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.211
than we do from an old phone.

00:05:45.783 --> 00:05:50.428
It's also much less likely
that we'll lose the ability to read DNA

00:05:50.452 --> 00:05:52.886
than any single man-made device.

00:05:53.567 --> 00:05:57.679
Every single new storage format
requires a new way to read it.

00:05:57.703 --> 00:05:59.836
We'll always be able to read DNA.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.928
If we can no longer sequence,
we have bigger problems

00:06:02.952 --> 00:06:05.233
than worrying about data storage.

00:06:05.725 --> 00:06:08.796
Storing data on DNA is not new.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.919
Nature's been doing it
for several billion years.

00:06:11.943 --> 00:06:15.835
In fact, every living thing
is a DNA storage device.

00:06:16.397 --> 00:06:19.183
But how do we store data on DNA?

00:06:19.725 --> 00:06:21.516
This is Photo 51.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.167
It's the first-ever photo of DNA,

00:06:24.191 --> 00:06:26.443
taken about 60 years ago.

00:06:26.467 --> 00:06:30.849
This is around the time that
that same hard drive was released by IBM.

00:06:31.246 --> 00:06:36.738
So really, our understanding of digital
storage and of DNA have coevolved.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.916
We first learned to sequence, or read DNA,

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.952
and very soon after, how to write it,

00:06:42.976 --> 00:06:44.535
or synthesize it.

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:48.123
This is much like how we learn
a new language.

00:06:48.812 --> 00:06:53.425
And now we have the ability
to read, write and copy DNA.

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:55.529
We do it in the lab all the time.

00:06:56.283 --> 00:07:00.165
So anything, really anything,
that can be stored as zeroes and ones

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:01.908
can be stored in DNA.

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:05.774
To store something digitally,
like this photo,

00:07:05.798 --> 00:07:09.104
we convert it to bits, or binary digits.

00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:13.339
Each pixel in a black-and-white photo
is simply a zero or a one.

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:18.673
And we can write DNA much like an inkjet
printer can print letters on a page.

00:07:18.697 --> 00:07:22.521
We just have to convert our data,
all of those zeroes and ones,

00:07:22.545 --> 00:07:24.683
to A's, T's, C's and G's,

00:07:24.707 --> 00:07:26.965
and then we send this
to a synthesis company.

00:07:26.989 --> 00:07:28.936
So we write it, we can store it,

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.194
and when we want to recover our data,
we just sequence it.

00:07:32.218 --> 00:07:36.299
Now, the fun part of all of this
is deciding what files to include.

00:07:36.323 --> 00:07:39.700
We're serious scientists,
so we had to include a manuscript

00:07:39.724 --> 00:07:41.467
for good posterity.

00:07:41.491 --> 00:07:44.324
We also included a $50 Amazon gift card --

00:07:44.348 --> 00:07:47.879
don't get too excited, it's already
been spent, someone decoded it --

00:07:47.903 --> 00:07:50.113
as well as an operating system,

00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:52.508
one of the first movies ever made

00:07:52.532 --> 00:07:54.270
and a Pioneer plaque.

00:07:54.294 --> 00:07:55.963
Some of you might have seen this.

00:07:55.987 --> 00:07:59.443
It has a depiction of a typical --
apparently -- male and female,

00:07:59.467 --> 00:08:02.029
and our approximate location
in the Solar System,

00:08:02.053 --> 00:08:06.055
in case the Pioneer spacecraft
ever encounters extraterrestrials.

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:09.790
So once we decided what sort of files
we want to encode,

00:08:09.814 --> 00:08:11.282
we package up the data,

00:08:11.306 --> 00:08:14.960
convert those zeroes and ones
to A's, T's, C's and G's,

00:08:14.984 --> 00:08:18.261
and then we just send this file off
to a synthesis company.

00:08:18.285 --> 00:08:20.055
And this is what we got back.

00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:21.998
Our files were in this tube.

00:08:22.022 --> 00:08:24.120
All we had to do was sequence it.

00:08:24.525 --> 00:08:27.056
This all sounds pretty straightforward,

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.058
but the difference between
a really cool, fun idea

00:08:30.082 --> 00:08:32.237
and something we can actually use

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:34.757
is overcoming these practical challenges.

00:08:35.453 --> 00:08:39.425
Now, while DNA is more robust
than any man-made device,

00:08:39.449 --> 00:08:40.734
it's not perfect.

00:08:40.758 --> 00:08:42.708
It does have some weaknesses.

00:08:43.364 --> 00:08:46.795
We recover our message
by sequencing the DNA,

00:08:46.819 --> 00:08:48.832
and every time data is retrieved,

00:08:48.856 --> 00:08:50.642
we lose the DNA.

00:08:50.666 --> 00:08:53.080
That's just part
of the sequencing process.

00:08:53.104 --> 00:08:55.039
We don't want to run out of data,

00:08:55.063 --> 00:08:58.159
but luckily, there's a way to copy the DNA

00:08:58.183 --> 00:09:02.768
that's even cheaper and easier
than synthesizing it.

00:09:03.275 --> 00:09:08.133
We actually tested a way to make
200 trillion copies of our files,

00:09:08.157 --> 00:09:10.889
and we recovered
all the data without error.

00:09:11.556 --> 00:09:15.423
So sequencing also introduces
errors into our DNA,

00:09:15.447 --> 00:09:17.754
into the A's, T's, C's and G's.

00:09:18.135 --> 00:09:21.113
Nature has a way
to deal with this in our cells.

00:09:21.137 --> 00:09:27.027
But our data is stored
in synthetic DNA in a tube,

00:09:27.051 --> 00:09:30.303
so we had to find our own way
to overcome this problem.

00:09:30.724 --> 00:09:34.967
We decided to use an algorithm
that was used to stream videos.

00:09:35.452 --> 00:09:36.905
When you're streaming a video,

00:09:36.929 --> 00:09:41.390
you're essentially trying to recover
the original video, the original file.

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:44.323
When we're trying to recover
our original files,

00:09:44.347 --> 00:09:46.195
we're simply sequencing.

00:09:46.219 --> 00:09:50.307
But really, both of these processes are
about recovering enough zeroes and ones

00:09:50.331 --> 00:09:52.124
to put our data back together.

00:09:52.711 --> 00:09:54.752
And so, because of our coding strategy,

00:09:54.776 --> 00:09:57.327
we were able to package up all of our data

00:09:57.351 --> 00:10:01.123
in a way that allowed us to make
millions and trillions of copies

00:10:01.147 --> 00:10:04.123
and still always recover
all of our files back.

00:10:04.708 --> 00:10:06.458
This is the movie we encoded.

00:10:06.482 --> 00:10:09.062
It's one of the first movies ever made,

00:10:09.086 --> 00:10:13.845
and now the first to be copied
more than 200 trillion times on DNA.

00:10:14.377 --> 00:10:16.507
Soon after our work was published,

00:10:16.531 --> 00:10:20.278
we participated in an "Ask Me Anything"
on the website reddit.

00:10:20.302 --> 00:10:23.477
If you're a fellow nerd,
you're very familiar with this website.

00:10:23.501 --> 00:10:25.446
Most questions were thoughtful.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:27.342
Some were comical.

00:10:27.366 --> 00:10:31.494
For example, one user wanted to know
when we would have a literal thumb drive.

00:10:32.091 --> 00:10:34.367
Now, the thing is,

00:10:34.391 --> 00:10:38.533
our DNA already stores everything
needed to make us who we are.

00:10:38.557 --> 00:10:42.375
It's a lot safer to store data on DNA

00:10:42.399 --> 00:10:45.220
in synthetic DNA in a tube.

00:10:46.704 --> 00:10:52.130
Writing and reading data from DNA
is obviously a lot more time-consuming

00:10:52.154 --> 00:10:55.249
than just saving all your files
on a hard drive --

00:10:55.273 --> 00:10:56.564
for now.

00:10:57.159 --> 00:11:00.940
So initially, we should focus
on long-term storage.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.940
Most data are ephemeral.

00:11:04.964 --> 00:11:07.552
It's really hard to grasp
what's important today,

00:11:07.576 --> 00:11:10.828
or what will be important
for future generations.

00:11:10.852 --> 00:11:13.415
But the point is,
we don't have to decide today.

00:11:14.065 --> 00:11:19.053
There's this great program by UNESCO
called the "Memory of the World" program.

00:11:19.077 --> 00:11:22.344
It's been created to preserve
historical materials

00:11:22.368 --> 00:11:25.495
that are considered of value
to all of humanity.

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.187
Items are nominated
to be added to the collection,

00:11:29.211 --> 00:11:31.466
including that film that we encoded.

00:11:32.188 --> 00:11:35.770
While a wonderful way
to preserve human heritage,

00:11:35.794 --> 00:11:37.706
it doesn't have to be a choice.

00:11:38.088 --> 00:11:41.542
Instead of asking
the current generation -- us --

00:11:41.566 --> 00:11:43.788
what might be important in the future,

00:11:43.812 --> 00:11:46.146
we could store everything in DNA.

00:11:47.543 --> 00:11:49.983
Storage is not just about how many bytes

00:11:50.007 --> 00:11:53.508
but how well we can actually
store the data and recover it.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.371
There's always been this tension
between how much data we can generate

00:11:57.395 --> 00:11:59.110
and how much we can recover

00:11:59.134 --> 00:12:00.903
and how much we can store.

00:12:01.841 --> 00:12:05.880
Every advance in writing data
has required a new way to read it.

00:12:05.904 --> 00:12:08.247
We can no longer read old media.

00:12:08.271 --> 00:12:12.012
How many of you even have
a disk drive in your laptop,

00:12:12.036 --> 00:12:13.760
never mind a floppy drive?

00:12:14.151 --> 00:12:16.703
This will never be the case with DNA.

00:12:16.727 --> 00:12:19.904
As long as we're around, DNA is around,

00:12:19.928 --> 00:12:22.108
and we'll find a way to sequence it.

00:12:23.214 --> 00:12:26.673
Archiving the world around us
is part of human nature.

00:12:27.172 --> 00:12:31.796
This is the progress we've made
in digital storage in 60 years,

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.196
at a time when we were only
beginning to understand DNA.

00:12:35.725 --> 00:12:40.570
Yet, we've made similar progress
in half that time with DNA sequencers,

00:12:40.594 --> 00:12:45.537
and as long as we're around,
DNA will never be obsolete.

00:12:46.107 --> 00:12:47.288
Thank you.

00:12:47.312 --> 00:12:52.293
