00:00:13.087 --> 00:00:15.421
Four hundred parts per million:

00:00:15.445 --> 00:00:20.233
that's the approximate concentration
of CO2 in the air today.

00:00:20.257 --> 00:00:21.680
What does this even mean?

00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:25.507
For every 400 molecules of carbon dioxide,

00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:30.044
we have another million molecules
of oxygen and nitrogen.

00:00:30.068 --> 00:00:33.969
In this room today,
there are about 1,800 of us.

00:00:33.993 --> 00:00:37.826
Imagine just one of us
was wearing a green shirt,

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.664
and you're asked to find
that single person.

00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:44.943
That's the challenge we're facing
when capturing CO2

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:46.545
directly out of the air.

00:00:47.357 --> 00:00:48.783
Sounds pretty easy,

00:00:48.807 --> 00:00:51.199
pulling CO2 out of the air.

00:00:51.223 --> 00:00:52.766
It's actually really difficult.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.610
But I'll tell you what is easy:

00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:58.065
avoiding CO2 emissions to begin with.

00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:00.317
But we're not doing that.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.290
So now what we have to think
about is going back;

00:01:05.314 --> 00:01:08.284
pulling CO2 back out of the air.

00:01:08.663 --> 00:01:12.538
Even though it's difficult,
it's actually possible to do this.

00:01:12.983 --> 00:01:16.552
And I'm going to share with you today
where this technology is at

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:19.265
and where it just may be heading
in the near future.

00:01:20.106 --> 00:01:24.936
Now, the earth naturally
removes CO2 from the air

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.613
by seawater, soils, plants and even rocks.

00:01:29.637 --> 00:01:34.355
And although engineers and scientists
are doing the invaluable work

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:37.631
to accelerate these natural processes,

00:01:37.655 --> 00:01:39.695
it simply won't be enough.

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.073
The good news is, we have more.

00:01:42.097 --> 00:01:45.911
Thanks to human ingenuity,
we have the technology today

00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:49.223
to remove CO2 out of the air

00:01:49.247 --> 00:01:51.852
using a chemically manufactured approach.

00:01:51.876 --> 00:01:55.141
I like to think of this
as a synthetic forest.

00:01:55.165 --> 00:02:00.485
There are two basic approaches
to growing or building such a forest.

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.613
One is using CO2-grabbing chemicals
dissolved in water.

00:02:05.637 --> 00:02:09.491
Another is using solid materials
with CO2-grabbing chemicals.

00:02:09.515 --> 00:02:12.998
No matter which approach you choose,
they basically look the same.

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.592
So what I'm showing you here
is what a system might look like

00:02:17.616 --> 00:02:19.077
to do just this.

00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:21.338
This is called an air contactor.

00:02:21.362 --> 00:02:23.648
You can see it has to be
really, really wide

00:02:23.672 --> 00:02:25.830
in order to have
a high enough surface area

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:28.570
to process all of the air required,

00:02:28.594 --> 00:02:29.746
because remember,

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.748
we're trying to capture
just 400 molecules out of a million.

00:02:34.293 --> 00:02:37.264
Using the liquid-based
approach to do this,

00:02:37.288 --> 00:02:39.654
you take this high surface area
packing material,

00:02:39.678 --> 00:02:42.499
you fill the contactor
with the packing material,

00:02:42.523 --> 00:02:47.195
you use pumps to distribute liquid
across the packing material,

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.130
and you can use fans,
as you can see in the front,

00:02:50.154 --> 00:02:52.595
to bubble the air through the liquid.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:56.985
The CO2 in the air
is separated [by] the liquid

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:03.668
by reacting with the really strong-binding
CO2 molecules in solution.

00:03:03.692 --> 00:03:06.354
And in order to capture a lot of CO2,

00:03:06.378 --> 00:03:08.947
you have to make this contactor deeper.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.801
But there's an optimization,

00:03:10.825 --> 00:03:12.871
because the deeper
you make that contactor,

00:03:12.895 --> 00:03:16.580
the more energy you're spending
on bubbling all that air through.

00:03:17.055 --> 00:03:21.409
So air contactors for direct air capture
have this unique characteristic design,

00:03:21.433 --> 00:03:25.755
where they have this huge surface area,
but a relatively thin thickness.

00:03:26.178 --> 00:03:28.805
And now once you've captured the CO2,

00:03:29.527 --> 00:03:33.408
you have to be able to recycle
that material that you used to capture it,

00:03:33.432 --> 00:03:34.971
over and over again.

00:03:34.995 --> 00:03:37.982
The scale of carbon capture is so enormous

00:03:38.006 --> 00:03:40.214
that the capture process
must be sustainable,

00:03:40.238 --> 00:03:42.318
and you can't use a material just once.

00:03:42.758 --> 00:03:46.981
And so recycling the material requires
an enormous amount of heat,

00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:50.261
because think about it:
CO2 is so dilute in the air,

00:03:50.285 --> 00:03:53.135
that material is binding it really strong,

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.996
and so you need a lot of heat
in order to recycle the material.

00:03:57.407 --> 00:04:00.070
And to recycle the material
with that heat,

00:04:00.094 --> 00:04:05.887
what happens is that concentrated CO2
that you got from dilute CO2 in the air

00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:07.504
is now released,

00:04:07.528 --> 00:04:10.002
and you produce high-purity CO2.

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:12.140
And that's really important,

00:04:12.164 --> 00:04:16.366
because high-purity CO2
is easier to liquify,

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.554
easier to transport, whether
it's in a pipeline or a truck,

00:04:19.578 --> 00:04:21.799
or even easier to use directly,

00:04:21.823 --> 00:04:24.411
say, as a fuel or a chemical.

00:04:25.033 --> 00:04:28.811
So I want to talk a little bit more
about that energy.

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:33.048
The heat required to regenerate
or recycle these materials

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:39.525
absolutely dictates the energy
and the subsequent cost of doing this.

00:04:40.834 --> 00:04:42.762
So I ask a question:

00:04:42.786 --> 00:04:45.644
How much energy do you think it takes

00:04:45.668 --> 00:04:49.409
to remove a million tons
of CO2 from the air

00:04:49.433 --> 00:04:50.791
in a given year?

00:04:51.343 --> 00:04:53.154
The answer is: a power plant.

00:04:53.178 --> 00:04:56.847
It takes a power plant
to capture CO2 directly from the air.

00:04:56.871 --> 00:04:58.755
Depending on which approach you choose,

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:03.197
the power plant could be on the order
of 300 to 500 megawatts.

00:05:03.847 --> 00:05:07.656
And you have to be careful about
what kind of power plant you choose.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.357
If you choose coal,

00:05:09.381 --> 00:05:12.959
you end up emitting more CO2
than you capture.

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:15.332
Now let's talk about costs.

00:05:15.356 --> 00:05:18.830
An energy-intensive version
of this technology

00:05:18.854 --> 00:05:21.945
could cost you as much
as $1,000 a ton

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:23.318
just to capture it.

00:05:24.183 --> 00:05:25.543
Let's translate that.

00:05:26.128 --> 00:05:30.143
If you were to take that very expensive
CO2 and convert it to a liquid fuel,

00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:32.504
that comes out to 50 dollars a gallon.

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:35.713
That's way too expensive;
it's not feasible.

00:05:35.737 --> 00:05:38.148
So how could we bring these costs down?

00:05:38.172 --> 00:05:40.644
That's, in part, the work that I do.

00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:44.490
There's a company today,
a commercial-scale company,

00:05:44.514 --> 00:05:47.203
that can do this as low
as 600 dollars a ton.

00:05:47.227 --> 00:05:51.008
There are several other companies
that are developing technologies

00:05:51.032 --> 00:05:53.157
that can do this even cheaper than that.

00:05:53.583 --> 00:05:55.352
I'm going to talk to you a little bit

00:05:55.376 --> 00:05:57.349
about a few of these different companies.

00:05:57.373 --> 00:05:59.041
One is called Carbon Engineering.

00:05:59.065 --> 00:06:00.533
They're based out of Canada.

00:06:00.557 --> 00:06:03.450
They use a liquid-based
approach for separation

00:06:03.474 --> 00:06:07.739
combined with burning
super-abundant, cheap natural gas

00:06:07.763 --> 00:06:10.098
to supply the heat required.

00:06:10.122 --> 00:06:11.806
They have a clever approach

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:16.120
that allows them to co-capture
the CO2 from the air

00:06:16.144 --> 00:06:20.103
and the CO2 that they generate
from burning the natural gas.

00:06:20.127 --> 00:06:21.929
And so by doing this,

00:06:21.953 --> 00:06:25.371
they offset excess pollution
and they reduce costs.

00:06:26.006 --> 00:06:30.052
Switzerland-based Climeworks
and US-based Global Thermostat

00:06:30.076 --> 00:06:31.679
use a different approach.

00:06:31.703 --> 00:06:34.312
They use solid materials for capture.

00:06:34.336 --> 00:06:37.119
Climeworks uses heat from the earth,

00:06:37.143 --> 00:06:38.556
or geothermal,

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.692
or even excess steam
from other industrial processes

00:06:41.716 --> 00:06:44.075
to cut down on pollution and costs.

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:46.959
Global Thermostat
takes a different approach.

00:06:46.983 --> 00:06:49.830
They focus on the heat required

00:06:49.854 --> 00:06:53.527
and the speed in which it moves
through the material

00:06:53.551 --> 00:06:58.230
so that they're able to release
and produce that CO2

00:06:58.254 --> 00:07:00.029
at a really fast rate,

00:07:00.053 --> 00:07:03.408
which allows them to have
a more compact design

00:07:03.432 --> 00:07:05.433
and overall cheaper costs.

00:07:06.806 --> 00:07:08.700
And there's more still.

00:07:08.724 --> 00:07:14.216
A synthetic forest has a significant
advantage over a real forest: size.

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:18.708
This next image that I'm showing you
is a map of the Amazon rainforest.

00:07:18.732 --> 00:07:24.811
The Amazon is capable of capturing
1.6 billion tons of CO2 each year.

00:07:24.835 --> 00:07:28.214
This is the equivalent
of roughly 25 percent

00:07:28.238 --> 00:07:30.533
of our annual emissions in the US.

00:07:31.007 --> 00:07:33.942
The land area required
for a synthetic forest

00:07:33.966 --> 00:07:36.263
or a manufactured direct air capture plant

00:07:36.287 --> 00:07:37.719
to capture the same

00:07:37.743 --> 00:07:39.831
is 500 times smaller.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.227
In addition, for a synthetic forest,

00:07:44.251 --> 00:07:47.116
you don't have to build it on arable land,

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.411
so there's no competition
with farmland or food,

00:07:51.435 --> 00:07:56.429
and there's also no reason
to have to cut down any real trees

00:07:56.453 --> 00:07:57.714
to do this.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.350
I want to step back,

00:08:00.374 --> 00:08:03.940
and I want to bring up the concept
of negative emissions again.

00:08:04.394 --> 00:08:07.963
Negative emissions require
that the CO2 separated

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:12.374
be permanently removed
from the atmosphere forever,

00:08:12.398 --> 00:08:15.120
which means putting it back underground,

00:08:15.144 --> 00:08:17.513
where it came from in the first place.

00:08:17.537 --> 00:08:21.076
But let's face it, nobody
gets paid to do that today --

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.458
at least not enough.

00:08:23.009 --> 00:08:26.497
So the companies that are developing
these technologies

00:08:26.521 --> 00:08:28.998
are actually interested in taking the CO2

00:08:29.022 --> 00:08:32.169
and making something useful
out of it, a marketable product.

00:08:32.193 --> 00:08:35.773
It could be liquid fuels, plastics

00:08:35.797 --> 00:08:37.543
or even synthetic gravel.

00:08:38.043 --> 00:08:41.209
And don't get me wrong --
these carbon markets are great.

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.268
But I also don't want you
to be disillusioned.

00:08:45.292 --> 00:08:49.021
These are not large enough
to solve our climate crisis,

00:08:49.045 --> 00:08:52.878
and so what we need to do
is we need to actually think about

00:08:52.902 --> 00:08:54.379
what it could take.

00:08:54.403 --> 00:08:58.382
One thing I'll absolutely say
is positive about the carbon markets

00:08:58.406 --> 00:09:02.998
is that they allow for new
capture plants to be built,

00:09:03.022 --> 00:09:04.925
and with every capture plant built,

00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:06.401
we learn more.

00:09:06.425 --> 00:09:07.936
And when we learn more,

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.684
we have an opportunity
to bring costs down.

00:09:11.914 --> 00:09:15.441
But we also need to be willing to invest

00:09:15.465 --> 00:09:17.121
as a global society.

00:09:18.534 --> 00:09:21.908
We could have all of the clever thinking
and technology in the world,

00:09:21.932 --> 00:09:23.567
but it's not going to be enough

00:09:23.591 --> 00:09:28.470
in order for this technology
to have a significant impact on climate.

00:09:28.494 --> 00:09:30.676
We really need regulation,

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.233
we need subsidies,

00:09:32.257 --> 00:09:34.450
taxes on carbon.

00:09:34.474 --> 00:09:39.284
There are a few of us that would
absolutely be willing to pay more,

00:09:39.308 --> 00:09:41.702
but what will be required

00:09:41.726 --> 00:09:44.419
is for carbon-neutral,
carbon-negative paths

00:09:44.443 --> 00:09:47.132
to be affordable for
the majority of society

00:09:47.156 --> 00:09:48.933
in order to impact climate.

00:09:49.403 --> 00:09:51.976
In addition to those kinds of investments,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.608
we also need investments
in research and development.

00:09:55.632 --> 00:09:57.189
So what might that look like?

00:09:57.865 --> 00:10:04.145
In 1966, the US invested about
a half a percent of gross domestic product

00:10:04.169 --> 00:10:05.664
in the Apollo program.

00:10:06.568 --> 00:10:09.420
It got people safely to the moon

00:10:09.444 --> 00:10:10.891
and back to the earth.

00:10:11.464 --> 00:10:14.993
Half a percent of GDP today
is about 100 billion dollars.

00:10:15.522 --> 00:10:18.251
So knowing that direct air capture

00:10:18.275 --> 00:10:21.478
is one front in our fight
against climate change,

00:10:21.502 --> 00:10:25.110
imagine that we could invest
20 percent, 20 billion dollars.

00:10:25.848 --> 00:10:28.729
Further, let's imagine
that we could get the costs down

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:30.426
to a 100 dollars a ton.

00:10:31.274 --> 00:10:35.046
That's going to be hard,
but it's part of what makes my job fun.

00:10:35.897 --> 00:10:37.438
And so what does that look like,

00:10:37.462 --> 00:10:39.783
20 billion dollars,100 dollars a ton?

00:10:39.807 --> 00:10:42.931
That requires us to build
200 synthetic forests,

00:10:42.955 --> 00:10:48.641
each capable of capturing
a million tons of CO2 per year.

00:10:48.665 --> 00:10:52.717
That adds up to about five percent
of US annual emissions.

00:10:53.235 --> 00:10:54.694
It doesn't sound like much.

00:10:55.226 --> 00:10:57.340
Turns out, it's actually significant.

00:10:57.364 --> 00:11:00.818
If you look at the emissions
associated with long-haul trucking

00:11:00.842 --> 00:11:02.574
and commercial aircraft,

00:11:02.598 --> 00:11:04.656
they add up to about five percent.

00:11:05.458 --> 00:11:09.123
Our dependence on liquid fuels
makes these emissions

00:11:09.147 --> 00:11:11.720
really difficult to avoid.

00:11:11.744 --> 00:11:16.559
So this investment
could absolutely be significant.

00:11:17.496 --> 00:11:20.599
Now, what would it take
in terms of land area to do this,

00:11:20.623 --> 00:11:21.961
200 plants?

00:11:22.406 --> 00:11:26.717
It turns out that they would take up
about half the land area of Vancouver.

00:11:26.741 --> 00:11:28.837
That's if they were fueled by natural gas.

00:11:28.861 --> 00:11:33.533
But remember the downside
of natural gas -- it also emits CO2.

00:11:33.557 --> 00:11:36.454
So if you use natural gas
to do direct air capture,

00:11:36.478 --> 00:11:40.239
you only end up capturing
about a third of what's intended,

00:11:40.263 --> 00:11:42.826
unless you have that
clever approach of co-capture

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.468
that Carbon Engineering does.

00:11:45.253 --> 00:11:47.432
And so if we had an alternative approach

00:11:47.456 --> 00:11:50.287
and used wind or solar to do this,

00:11:50.311 --> 00:11:53.899
the land area would be
about 15 times larger,

00:11:53.923 --> 00:11:55.933
looking at the state of New Jersey now.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.892
One of the things that I think about
in my work and my research

00:11:59.916 --> 00:12:03.841
is optimizing and figuring out
where we should put these plants

00:12:03.865 --> 00:12:06.518
and think about
the local resources available --

00:12:06.542 --> 00:12:10.217
whether it's land, water,
cheap and clean electricity --

00:12:10.241 --> 00:12:12.943
because, for instance,
you can use clean electricity

00:12:12.967 --> 00:12:15.152
to split water to produce hydrogen,

00:12:15.176 --> 00:12:19.057
which is an excellent, carbon-free
replacement for natural gas,

00:12:19.081 --> 00:12:20.831
to supply the heat required.

00:12:22.212 --> 00:12:25.984
But I want us to reflect a little bit
again on negative emissions.

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:29.973
Negative emissions should not be
considered a silver bullet,

00:12:29.997 --> 00:12:32.500
but they may help us
if we continue to stall

00:12:32.524 --> 00:12:35.783
at cutting down on CO2
pollution worldwide.

00:12:36.441 --> 00:12:39.475
But that's also why we have to be careful.

00:12:39.499 --> 00:12:42.476
This approach is so alluring
that it can even be risky,

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:47.474
as some may cling onto it as some kind
of total solution to our climate crisis.

00:12:47.982 --> 00:12:53.437
It may tempt people to continue
to burn fossil fuels 24 hours a day,

00:12:53.461 --> 00:12:55.635
365 days a year.

00:12:55.659 --> 00:12:58.865
I argue that we should not
see negative emissions

00:12:58.889 --> 00:13:00.817
as a replacement for stopping pollution,

00:13:00.841 --> 00:13:06.612
but rather, as an addition to an existing
portfolio that includes everything,

00:13:06.636 --> 00:13:08.411
from increased energy efficiency

00:13:08.435 --> 00:13:10.149
to low-energy carbon

00:13:10.173 --> 00:13:11.806
to improved farming --

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:16.831
will all collectively get us on a path
to net-zero emissions one day.

00:13:17.909 --> 00:13:19.735
A little bit of self-reflection:

00:13:20.481 --> 00:13:22.989
my husband is an emergency physician.

00:13:23.727 --> 00:13:27.272
And I find myself amazed
by the lifesaving work

00:13:27.296 --> 00:13:30.593
that he and his colleagues
do each and every day.

00:13:31.235 --> 00:13:35.168
Yet when I talk to them
about my work on carbon capture,

00:13:35.192 --> 00:13:37.454
I find that they're equally amazed,

00:13:37.896 --> 00:13:42.669
and that's because combatting
climate change by capturing carbon

00:13:42.693 --> 00:13:44.751
isn't just about saving a polar bear

00:13:44.775 --> 00:13:45.941
or a glacier.

00:13:45.965 --> 00:13:47.635
It's about saving human lives.

00:13:49.905 --> 00:13:54.922
A synthetic forest may not ever be
as pretty as a real one,

00:13:54.946 --> 00:13:58.565
but it could just enable us
to preserve not only the Amazon,

00:13:58.589 --> 00:14:00.049
but all of the people

00:14:00.073 --> 00:14:02.443
that we love and cherish,

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:07.129
as well as all of our future generations

00:14:07.153 --> 00:14:08.815
and modern civilization.

00:14:08.839 --> 00:14:09.992
Thank you.

00:14:10.016 --> 00:14:14.239
(Applause)
