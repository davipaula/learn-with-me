00:00:06.836 --> 00:00:11.726
The full scope of a nuclear detonation 
is almost unimaginable.

00:00:11.726 --> 00:00:16.726
Hopefully, no one will ever experience 
another of these catastrophic incidents.

00:00:16.726 --> 00:00:20.621
But there is a scientifically supported 
plan of action

00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:22.931
that could save hundreds 
of thousands of lives

00:00:22.931 --> 00:00:25.911
in the area surrounding 
a nuclear explosion.

00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:27.411
So what is this plan,

00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:30.241
and what exactly would it protect us from?

00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:32.491
To create their destructive blast,

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:35.951
these weapons harness 
the power of nuclear fission–

00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:39.431
in which an atom’s nucleus 
is split in two.

00:00:39.431 --> 00:00:42.871
This process produces an incredible 
amount of energy,

00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:46.871
and in some materials the neutrons 
produced by one fission

00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:49.331
are absorbed by nearby atoms,

00:00:49.331 --> 00:00:51.581
splitting additional nuclei.

00:00:51.581 --> 00:00:55.641
These chain reactions can produce 
a range of explosive yields,

00:00:55.641 --> 00:01:01.141
but let’s consider an explosion 
equivalent to 10,000 tons of TNT.

00:01:01.147 --> 00:01:02.997
An explosion like this would create

00:01:02.997 --> 00:01:06.777
a fireball capable of decimating 
a few city blocks

00:01:06.777 --> 00:01:10.877
and a shockwave damaging buildings 
several kilometers away.

00:01:10.877 --> 00:01:12.998
There is tragically nothing 
that can be done

00:01:12.998 --> 00:01:15.938
to save those in the fireball’s radius.

00:01:15.938 --> 00:01:19.347
However, for those in the 
shockwave and beyond,

00:01:19.347 --> 00:01:23.357
our scientifically supported protocol 
could be life saving.

00:01:23.357 --> 00:01:25.297
And though it may sound surprising,

00:01:25.297 --> 00:01:30.567
the best way to stay protected before, 
during, and after a nuclear detonation,

00:01:30.567 --> 00:01:32.688
is getting inside.

00:01:32.688 --> 00:01:36.408
Similar to protecting yourself 
from tornadoes or hurricanes,

00:01:36.408 --> 00:01:40.328
getting and staying inside a sturdy 
building would offer protection

00:01:40.328 --> 00:01:43.928
from the explosion’s shockwave, 
heat, and radiation.

00:01:43.928 --> 00:01:45.858
The shockwave of energy would travel

00:01:45.858 --> 00:01:50.708
several kilometers beyond the fireball’s 
radius in the first few seconds.

00:01:50.708 --> 00:01:55.238
Sturdy buildings within that range should
be able to withstand the shockwave,

00:01:55.238 --> 00:01:58.791
and staying in the centers and basements 
of these buildings

00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:02.951
also helps provide protection from 
heat and flying objects.

00:02:03.758 --> 00:02:08.828
Finding shelter is especially important 
if the fireball occurs close to the earth,

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:12.290
as it will pull thousands of tons of dirt 
and debris

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.270
several kilometers into the atmosphere.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.050
As the fireball cools,

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.600
unstable atoms created by the nuclear 
fission mix with the debris

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.800
to produce the most dangerous long-term 
effect of a nuclear detonation:

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.303
radioactive particles called fallout.

00:02:29.303 --> 00:02:33.413
These sand-sized particles emit 
ionizing radiation,

00:02:33.413 --> 00:02:37.291
capable of separating electrons from 
molecules and atoms.

00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:41.851
Exposure to massive amounts of this 
radiation can result in cell damage,

00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:47.058
radiation burns, radiation sickness, 
cancer, and even death.

00:02:47.058 --> 00:02:49.298
Created several kilometers up,

00:02:49.298 --> 00:02:51.768
dangerous concentrations of this material

00:02:51.768 --> 00:02:54.798
would be driven by upper 
atmospheric winds,

00:02:54.798 --> 00:02:57.768
potentially leading to hazardous 
levels of fallout

00:02:57.768 --> 00:03:01.728
in areas up to tens of 
kilometers downwind.

00:03:01.738 --> 00:03:05.466
Thankfully, the same buildings that offer
protection from the blast

00:03:05.466 --> 00:03:08.796
are even better at 
guarding against fallout.

00:03:08.796 --> 00:03:12.993
Radiation is reduced as it travels 
through space and mass.

00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:15.473
So while a broken window and sealed window

00:03:15.473 --> 00:03:18.493
both have the same minimal 
effect on radiation,

00:03:18.493 --> 00:03:22.393
thick layers of steel, concrete, 
and packed earth

00:03:22.393 --> 00:03:24.733
can offer serious protection.

00:03:24.733 --> 00:03:28.562
And since fallout gives off half of its 
energy in the first hour

00:03:28.562 --> 00:03:30.992
and 80% in the first day,

00:03:30.992 --> 00:03:35.072
staying inside for 24 hours could 
dramatically improve the odds

00:03:35.072 --> 00:03:38.752
of avoiding the most serious 
effects of radiation.

00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:43.012
Following the blast there would be at 
least 15 minutes to find shelter

00:03:43.012 --> 00:03:45.092
before the fallout begins.

00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:48.432
Since the most hazardous fallout particles
are the heaviest,

00:03:48.432 --> 00:03:49.962
they sink through the air

00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:52.322
and collect on streets and rooftops,

00:03:52.322 --> 00:03:57.842
making ideal shelters underground 
or in the middle of high-rise buildings.

00:03:57.842 --> 00:04:00.562
But if someone were to get 
caught in the fallout,

00:04:00.562 --> 00:04:02.842
there are still measures they could take.

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:04.472
After finding a safe space,

00:04:04.472 --> 00:04:07.252
they should remove their shoes 
and outer layers,

00:04:07.252 --> 00:04:09.092
wash any exposed skin,

00:04:09.092 --> 00:04:12.582
and store the contaminated 
clothing far away.

00:04:12.582 --> 00:04:13.612
Once inside,

00:04:13.612 --> 00:04:16.522
plan on staying there 
for at least 24 hours.

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:20.792
If the shelter is poor, or someone 
inside needs urgent medical attention,

00:04:20.792 --> 00:04:24.049
try seeking outside help after an hour.

00:04:24.049 --> 00:04:24.899
But ideally,

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:29.909
stay inside and stay tuned for more 
information from first responders.

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:33.712
While electric power, cell service, and
Internet would be down,

00:04:33.712 --> 00:04:36.152
most radios would likely survive.

00:04:36.152 --> 00:04:38.612
So listen in for emergency responders

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:41.572
to determine the safest course forward.

00:04:41.572 --> 00:04:45.652
Nuclear weapons are some of the most 
powerful tools of destruction on Earth,

00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:49.944
and it may seem naive to put faith in
these straightforward protective measures.

00:04:49.944 --> 00:04:53.494
But studies and simulations have 
repeatedly shown the benefits

00:04:53.494 --> 00:04:55.294
of getting inside.

00:04:55.294 --> 00:04:57.494
So while we’ll hopefully never need to,

00:04:57.494 --> 00:05:02.394
remember to Get Inside, Stay Inside, 
and Stay Tuned.
