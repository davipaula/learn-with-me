00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:15.560
If you told me five years ago

00:00:15.584 --> 00:00:18.147
that today I'd be delivering a talk

00:00:18.171 --> 00:00:22.174
about our individual power
to make a difference,

00:00:22.198 --> 00:00:24.621
I would have cringed.

00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:28.978
It was my job to study
huge global systems.

00:00:29.336 --> 00:00:34.838
I was a researcher at NASA using
satellite data to study the big picture.

00:00:36.053 --> 00:00:38.875
You can see a lot of things from space,

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.133
like every ecosystem on Earth

00:00:42.157 --> 00:00:45.742
being threatened
from pretty much every angle

00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:50.727
and global inequality
in air and water safety.

00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:53.470
These kinds of things
would keep me up at night.

00:00:53.494 --> 00:00:56.896
And then outside of work,
I'd use this bird's-eye view

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.248
while thinking about
our huge social structures

00:00:59.272 --> 00:01:03.109
like education and media and health care,

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:06.226
and it looked to me like
they were all really struggling, too.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.316
So I felt like the world was just trapped
in this huge self-amplifying system

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.213
that was just spiraling
towards destruction.

00:01:15.237 --> 00:01:18.732
And of course I wanted
to do something about this,

00:01:18.756 --> 00:01:22.319
and I felt so small and utterly powerless.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.165
But I started to feel a little differently
as my perspective shifted

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.349
from the macro towards the micro.

00:01:30.974 --> 00:01:32.947
It began with bumblebees.

00:01:33.463 --> 00:01:36.509
I was using satellite imagery
and field research

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:40.226
to study these amazing, cute pollinators

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.810
to see how they were doing in the midst
of their own environmental crisis

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:45.366
in Southern California.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.940
And from the macro view,
I saw 22-lane freeways,

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:51.811
endless suburban sprawl

00:01:51.835 --> 00:01:55.325
and water being diverted
from parched rivers

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:58.871
to grow lawns in the desert.

00:01:59.204 --> 00:02:00.980
It was pretty grim.

00:02:01.652 --> 00:02:03.465
But on the ground,

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:06.690
there were actually some small
opportunities for optimism,

00:02:06.714 --> 00:02:08.511
these tiny patches of resources

00:02:08.535 --> 00:02:10.762
known as "habitat fragments."

00:02:11.355 --> 00:02:15.853
If the right kinds of plants were growing
along the edges of a Costco parking lot,

00:02:15.877 --> 00:02:17.731
and if in the neighborhoods nearby

00:02:17.755 --> 00:02:20.050
there were native plants
in people's gardens,

00:02:20.074 --> 00:02:24.194
and in the canyons that were too steep
for people to put their suburbs in,

00:02:24.218 --> 00:02:26.747
there were native plants
instead of grasses

00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:29.117
then all of these in-between spaces

00:02:29.141 --> 00:02:33.823
would actually add up to create
a network of habitat fragments.

00:02:33.847 --> 00:02:38.572
And this network meant that the bees
could traverse through the concrete desert

00:02:38.596 --> 00:02:41.488
feeding from and pollinating
the native plants.

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:47.896
And these plants that the bees depend on
and that the bees sustain are essential.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.422
They stabilize our steep hillsides.

00:02:50.446 --> 00:02:55.483
They provide food and homes to thousands
of amazing species of animals,

00:02:55.507 --> 00:03:02.095
and, critically, they are helping
to curb our devastating cycle of wildfires

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:06.214
by preventing the growth
of those invasive grasses

00:03:06.238 --> 00:03:10.599
that fuel the vicious flames
that we're all too familiar with.

00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:13.741
It's a really vital
and interconnected system,

00:03:13.765 --> 00:03:17.043
and some people could see
how they were a part of it,

00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:20.982
and so they acted
as habitat fragment gardeners.

00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:23.386
They planted native plants in their yards,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.737
and they even were tending
to the land in corporate parks

00:03:26.761 --> 00:03:28.223
and in public canyons.

00:03:28.247 --> 00:03:31.133
In my research, I could
actually see the impact

00:03:31.157 --> 00:03:33.847
that even one passionate
gardener could make.

00:03:33.871 --> 00:03:36.174
And then, repeated across the region,

00:03:36.198 --> 00:03:41.034
their habitat fragments were adding up
to make a more resilient ecosystem --

00:03:41.058 --> 00:03:44.263
not a perfect system, not by a long shot,

00:03:44.287 --> 00:03:47.983
but at least a system that was
less likely to totally collapse

00:03:48.007 --> 00:03:51.921
under impending pressures
like further development and drought.

00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:55.234
So I was looking at the world
through this lens

00:03:55.258 --> 00:03:59.112
when I found myself in the waiting room
of a public hospital in Brooklyn

00:03:59.136 --> 00:04:00.935
with my partner, Charles.

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.933
We were sitting across
from a group of teenagers

00:04:03.957 --> 00:04:05.699
who were slumped in their chairs

00:04:05.723 --> 00:04:08.005
and bored out of their minds

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:11.523
and just refreshing their phones
over and over again.

00:04:11.547 --> 00:04:13.272
And in a neighborhood

00:04:13.296 --> 00:04:16.951
with some of the lowest high school
graduation rates in the city,

00:04:16.975 --> 00:04:20.260
this waiting room felt like
a social habitat fragment

00:04:20.284 --> 00:04:21.943
just waiting to happen.

00:04:22.445 --> 00:04:26.371
So, we did some research to see
what kinds of resources could we add

00:04:26.395 --> 00:04:27.831
to spaces like this one

00:04:27.855 --> 00:04:29.719
that would make an impact.

00:04:29.743 --> 00:04:32.385
And we settled on museums.

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.866
Museums are the most trusted source
of public information,

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.400
more than the media
and more than the government,

00:04:39.424 --> 00:04:42.517
but they also cluster
in wealthier neighborhoods.

00:04:43.017 --> 00:04:46.824
New York has 85 museums in Manhattan,

00:04:46.848 --> 00:04:49.434
and the Bronx has eight,

00:04:49.458 --> 00:04:53.109
even though these two boroughs
have almost the same size population.

00:04:53.728 --> 00:04:57.427
And then expensive tickets mean
that a lot of people can't go to museums

00:04:57.451 --> 00:04:58.876
even if they live nearby.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.677
And these little injustices,
they just go on and on

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:04.421
and they add up to create
sweeping inequalities

00:05:04.445 --> 00:05:06.356
in knowledge and empowerment.

00:05:07.346 --> 00:05:08.682
Across the US,

00:05:08.706 --> 00:05:12.909
almost 90 percent of visitors
to art museums are white,

00:05:12.933 --> 00:05:16.438
and even at the Smithsonian's
network of free museums,

00:05:16.462 --> 00:05:19.860
almost half of their adult visitors
have graduate degrees,

00:05:19.884 --> 00:05:23.515
which, like, 10 percent
of the broader population has.

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.287
So it became clear to us

00:05:25.311 --> 00:05:31.253
that even though museums are these amazing
educational and social resources,

00:05:31.277 --> 00:05:33.243
they're not reaching everyone.

00:05:33.267 --> 00:05:36.931
And a lot of museums are aware of this,
and they're trying to change it,

00:05:36.955 --> 00:05:40.843
but there's all these structural hurdles
that are slowing them down.

00:05:40.867 --> 00:05:43.368
So we set out to create
a distributed network

00:05:43.392 --> 00:05:45.561
of museum habitat fragments.

00:05:46.295 --> 00:05:48.745
Working from a donated shipping container

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:51.945
with the volunteer help of our friends

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:53.868
and dozens of very generous scientists

00:05:53.892 --> 00:05:55.706
from all across the globe,

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.464
we built our first prototype:

00:05:58.488 --> 00:06:00.440
the Smallest Mollusk Museum.

00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:02.183
(Laughter)

00:06:02.207 --> 00:06:06.207
Mollusks are these tentacled,
slimy shape-shifters

00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:09.427
like oysters and octopuses
and the giant squid,

00:06:09.451 --> 00:06:12.793
and if you've ever seen
an alien in a movie,

00:06:12.817 --> 00:06:15.499
then I'll bet you
it was inspired by a mollusk.

00:06:15.975 --> 00:06:18.152
Their slimy sci-fi vibes

00:06:18.176 --> 00:06:21.541
make them really fun tour guides
for a biology museum,

00:06:21.565 --> 00:06:24.400
and they can teach us
about the systems that we all share,

00:06:24.424 --> 00:06:26.032
with a wake-up call.

00:06:26.467 --> 00:06:30.596
Of all the animal extinctions
documented since the 1500s,

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.765
more than 40 percent have been
our friends, the mollusks.

00:06:36.302 --> 00:06:38.958
So we tested this museum across the city

00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:41.561
to see if it resonated
with all kinds of visitors,

00:06:41.585 --> 00:06:42.845
and it did.

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:45.958
People really liked learning from it.

00:06:45.982 --> 00:06:49.788
So we built a fleet
of tiny science museums,

00:06:49.812 --> 00:06:53.801
each one small enough to fit
into preexisting locations

00:06:53.825 --> 00:06:56.969
with information dense enough
that they could still pack a punch.

00:06:56.993 --> 00:06:59.291
And they're modular,
so they can be distributed

00:06:59.315 --> 00:07:01.779
at a scale that can reach everyone.

00:07:01.803 --> 00:07:04.228
And then we partnered with libraries

00:07:04.252 --> 00:07:06.508
and community centers and transit hubs

00:07:06.532 --> 00:07:08.316
and the public hospitals

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.179
so that we could transform
their in-between spaces

00:07:11.203 --> 00:07:14.035
into habitat fragments
for social learning.

00:07:14.553 --> 00:07:18.874
And, fittingly, we named
our fleet of museums "MICRO."

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:22.536
Even though each
habitat fragment is small,

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.878
it provides the essentials.

00:07:23.902 --> 00:07:27.226
It draws people in
so that they can explore

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.702
and learn together in a social way.

00:07:29.726 --> 00:07:31.972
And then, distributed
across the landscape,

00:07:31.996 --> 00:07:33.822
we're able to invite people everywhere

00:07:33.846 --> 00:07:36.097
into conversations around science.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.294
When we partnered with
a public hospital in the South Bronx,

00:07:40.318 --> 00:07:45.156
we became the Bronx's first
and only science museum.

00:07:46.329 --> 00:07:49.207
Yeah, that's really weird. (Laughs)

00:07:49.231 --> 00:07:50.324
(Laughter)

00:07:50.348 --> 00:07:52.143
And really quickly,

00:07:52.167 --> 00:07:54.924
families started coming by with their kids

00:07:54.948 --> 00:07:57.748
and schools started arranging field trips,

00:07:57.772 --> 00:08:02.280
all to this tiny museum in the front lobby
of the public hospital.

00:08:02.304 --> 00:08:03.851
(Laughter)

00:08:03.875 --> 00:08:05.765
And the museum became so popular

00:08:05.789 --> 00:08:09.794
that we started hiring local students
to be museum docents,

00:08:09.818 --> 00:08:13.888
so they could lead tours and activities
for all the talented kids.

00:08:14.293 --> 00:08:19.808
And every spark of curiosity
that we're able to fuel

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:22.121
and each new fact learned

00:08:22.145 --> 00:08:24.836
and every new friend made at the museum

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.457
and every kid who can have a meaningful
and important after-school job,

00:08:29.481 --> 00:08:32.133
it all contributes to a stronger system.

00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:36.312
So today, I try to keep
the MICRO view in mind.

00:08:36.336 --> 00:08:40.095
I'm always examining
how small actions can add up

00:08:40.119 --> 00:08:42.247
to create shifts

00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:45.160
at the macro scale of systems.

00:08:45.668 --> 00:08:48.945
And honestly, I'm seeing
a lot of really good things.

00:08:48.969 --> 00:08:54.026
There are habitat fragments everywhere,
nurtured by talented, passionate,

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.593
strategic individuals
in groups of all sizes,

00:08:56.617 --> 00:09:00.764
who are building towards systems
with more equal access to food

00:09:00.788 --> 00:09:03.981
and employment, health care, housing,

00:09:04.005 --> 00:09:08.143
political empowerment, education
and healthy environments.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.796
One by one, together,

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.558
we're filling gaps,

00:09:12.582 --> 00:09:15.733
strengthening the systems
that we're all a part of.

00:09:16.182 --> 00:09:19.427
We have to work on
the big institutions too, of course.

00:09:19.451 --> 00:09:21.025
It's just that they're so slow,

00:09:21.049 --> 00:09:23.836
and we're living in the midst
of rapid change.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.366
It's a defining feature of our time.

00:09:26.834 --> 00:09:29.712
So maybe in some cases our small actions

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:32.494
can be Band-Aids
until the big guys catch up.

00:09:32.518 --> 00:09:36.185
But without us, what are they going
to be catching up to?

00:09:37.342 --> 00:09:40.201
Am I still scared about the world?

00:09:40.225 --> 00:09:42.485
Yes. (Laughs)

00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:44.775
That's why I'm talking to you.

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:48.278
The world needs so many
more habitat fragments.

00:09:48.302 --> 00:09:52.933
So, if you've been feeling overwhelmed
or powerless lately,

00:09:52.957 --> 00:09:57.638
then I'm asking you to please try
this very small strategy on for size,

00:09:57.662 --> 00:09:59.350
and let's see how it goes.

00:09:59.973 --> 00:10:02.554
Step one: zoom in.

00:10:02.578 --> 00:10:04.415
It's not one huge system

00:10:04.439 --> 00:10:07.359
that's just barreling unstoppably
towards destruction.

00:10:07.383 --> 00:10:10.555
What we have are many overlapping systems,

00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:13.574
and the ways that they interact
determine everything.

00:10:14.225 --> 00:10:16.966
Step two: look for the resource gaps,

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.790
because that's where you
can make the biggest difference.

00:10:20.437 --> 00:10:25.395
And do some research to understand
how your ideas are going to interact

00:10:25.419 --> 00:10:27.774
with the systems that are
already on the ground.

00:10:28.327 --> 00:10:31.764
Step three: find the other
habitat fragments.

00:10:31.788 --> 00:10:35.272
Find out how they can support you
and how you can support them,

00:10:35.296 --> 00:10:37.617
because we're building a network together.

00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:42.255
And step four: transform your fragment.

00:10:43.255 --> 00:10:49.449
You might not have the leverage
to change multiple systems at once,

00:10:49.473 --> 00:10:54.032
but there are so many small,
meaningful and strategic things

00:10:54.056 --> 00:10:56.246
that each of us can do.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.894
And there are a lot of us,

00:10:58.918 --> 00:11:00.996
so it will add up.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:02.905
Thank you.

00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:05.698
