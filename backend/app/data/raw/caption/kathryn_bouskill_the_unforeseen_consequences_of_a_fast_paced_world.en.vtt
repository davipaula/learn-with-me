00:00:12.686 --> 00:00:16.584
Do you ever wonder why we're surrounded
with things that help us do everything

00:00:16.608 --> 00:00:19.611
faster and faster and faster?

00:00:20.294 --> 00:00:21.535
Communicate faster,

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:24.505
but also work faster, bank faster,

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.463
travel faster, find a date faster,

00:00:27.487 --> 00:00:32.319
cook faster, clean faster
and do all of it all at the same time?

00:00:32.803 --> 00:00:37.317
How do you feel about cramming
even more into every waking hour?

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.903
Well, to my generation of Americans,

00:00:40.927 --> 00:00:43.176
speed feels like a birthright.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.543
Sometimes I think
our minimum speed is Mach 3.

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:49.964
Anything less, and we fear
losing our competitive edge.

00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:53.261
But even my generation
is starting to question

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:55.772
whether we're the masters of speed

00:00:55.796 --> 00:00:58.322
or if speed is mastering us.

00:00:59.475 --> 00:01:01.897
I'm an anthropologist
at the Rand Corporation,

00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:04.696
and while many anthropologists
study ancient cultures,

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.738
I focus on modern day cultures
and how we're adapting

00:01:07.762 --> 00:01:10.959
to all of this change
happening in the world.

00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:16.985
Recently, I teamed up with an engineer,
Seifu Chonde, to study speed.

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.043
We were interested both in how people
are adapting to this age of acceleration

00:01:22.067 --> 00:01:25.073
and its security and policy implications.

00:01:25.556 --> 00:01:28.016
What could our world look like in 25 years

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.923
if the current pace of change
keeps accelerating?

00:01:30.947 --> 00:01:32.812
What would it mean for transportation,

00:01:32.836 --> 00:01:35.232
or learning, communication,

00:01:35.256 --> 00:01:37.693
manufacturing, weaponry

00:01:37.717 --> 00:01:39.639
or even natural selection?

00:01:40.253 --> 00:01:43.844
Will a faster future make us
more secure and productive?

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:46.617
Or will it make us more vulnerable?

00:01:47.203 --> 00:01:51.207
In our research, people accepted
acceleration as inevitable,

00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:53.900
both the thrills and the lack of control.

00:01:53.924 --> 00:01:56.061
They fear that if they were to slow down,

00:01:56.085 --> 00:01:58.743
they might run the risk
of becoming obsolete.

00:01:58.767 --> 00:02:01.590
They say they'd rather
burn out than rust out.

00:02:02.285 --> 00:02:03.576
Yet at the same time,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.793
they worry that speed could
erode their cultural traditions

00:02:06.817 --> 00:02:08.533
and their sense of home.

00:02:09.524 --> 00:02:11.876
But even people who are winning
at the speed game

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.784
admit to feeling a little uneasy.

00:02:13.808 --> 00:02:17.407
They see acceleration as widening
the gap between the haves,

00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:19.926
the jet-setters who are buzzing around,

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.316
and the have-nots,

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.722
who are left in the digital dust.

00:02:24.984 --> 00:02:29.048
Yes, we have good reason to forecast
that the future will be faster,

00:02:29.072 --> 00:02:30.795
but what I've come to realize

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.342
is that speed is paradoxical,

00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:35.174
and like all good paradoxes,

00:02:35.198 --> 00:02:37.897
it teaches us about the human experience,

00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:41.009
as absurd and complex as it is.

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:44.311
The first paradox is that we love speed,

00:02:44.335 --> 00:02:46.416
and we're thrilled by its intensity.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.112
But our prehistoric brains
aren't really built for it,

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:54.603
so we invent roller coasters
and race cars and supersonic planes,

00:02:54.627 --> 00:02:57.752
but we get whiplash, carsick,

00:02:57.776 --> 00:02:58.936
jet-lagged.

00:02:59.584 --> 00:03:01.861
We didn't evolve to multitask.

00:03:01.885 --> 00:03:05.989
Rather, we evolved to do one thing
with incredible focus,

00:03:06.013 --> 00:03:08.907
like hunt -- not necessarily
with great speed

00:03:08.931 --> 00:03:11.681
but with endurance for great distance.

00:03:11.705 --> 00:03:15.851
But now there's a widening gap
between our biology and our lifestyles,

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:20.527
a mismatch between what our bodies are
built for and what we're making them do.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.215
It's a phenomenon my mentors have called
"Stone Agers in the fast lane."

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.466
(Laughter)

00:03:28.087 --> 00:03:31.585
A second paradox of speed is that
it can be measured objectively. Right?

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.499
Miles per hour, gigabytes per second.

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:37.179
But how speed feels,

00:03:37.203 --> 00:03:38.655
and whether we like it,

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:40.339
is highly subjective.

00:03:40.717 --> 00:03:42.480
So we can document

00:03:42.504 --> 00:03:46.763
that the pace at which we are adopting
new technologies is increasing.

00:03:46.787 --> 00:03:51.969
For example, it took 85 years
from the introduction of the telephone

00:03:51.993 --> 00:03:54.943
to when the majority of Americans
had phones at home.

00:03:55.438 --> 00:04:00.151
In contrast, it only took 13 years
for most of us to have smartphones.

00:04:00.627 --> 00:04:03.226
And how people act and react to speed

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.227
varies by culture and among
different people within the same culture.

00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:11.408
Interactions that could be seen
as pleasantly brisk and convenient

00:04:11.432 --> 00:04:12.751
in some cultures

00:04:12.775 --> 00:04:14.800
could be seen as horribly rude in others.

00:04:14.824 --> 00:04:19.231
I mean, you wouldn't go asking
for a to-go cup at a Japanese tea ceremony

00:04:19.255 --> 00:04:21.767
so you could jet off
to your next tourist stop.

00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:22.984
Would you?

00:04:23.968 --> 00:04:28.240
A third paradox
is that speed begets speed.

00:04:28.264 --> 00:04:30.520
The faster I respond,
the more responses I get,

00:04:30.544 --> 00:04:32.527
the faster I have to respond again.

00:04:33.241 --> 00:04:35.191
Having more communication

00:04:35.215 --> 00:04:37.454
and information at our fingertips

00:04:37.478 --> 00:04:39.097
at any given moment

00:04:39.121 --> 00:04:43.002
was supposed to make decision-making
easier and more rational.

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:46.553
But that doesn't really
seem to be happening.

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.894
Here's just one more paradox:

00:04:50.601 --> 00:04:56.071
If all of these faster technologies
were supposed to free us from drudgery,

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:58.966
why do we all feel so pressed for time?

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.725
Why are we crashing our cars
in record numbers,

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:05.147
because we think we have
to answer that text right away?

00:05:05.878 --> 00:05:09.374
Shouldn't life in the fast lane
feel a little more fun

00:05:09.398 --> 00:05:11.005
and a little less anxious?

00:05:11.464 --> 00:05:13.948
German speakers even have a word for this:

00:05:13.972 --> 00:05:15.416
"Eilkrankheit."

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.454
In English, that's "hurry sickness."

00:05:19.055 --> 00:05:21.744
When we have to make fast decisions,

00:05:21.768 --> 00:05:23.590
autopilot brain kicks in,

00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:26.252
and we rely on our learned behaviors,

00:05:26.276 --> 00:05:30.098
our reflexes, our cognitive biases,

00:05:30.122 --> 00:05:33.034
to help us perceive and respond quickly.

00:05:33.502 --> 00:05:35.503
Sometimes that saves our lives, right?

00:05:35.527 --> 00:05:36.721
Fight or flight.

00:05:37.134 --> 00:05:40.479
But sometimes, it leads us astray
in the long run.

00:05:41.443 --> 00:05:44.934
Oftentimes, when our society
has major failures,

00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.856
they're not technological failures.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.701
They're failures that happen
when we made decisions too quickly

00:05:51.725 --> 00:05:53.240
on autopilot.

00:05:53.264 --> 00:05:56.075
We didn't do the creative
or critical thinking required

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:57.494
to connect the dots

00:05:57.518 --> 00:05:59.335
or weed out false information

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.573
or make sense of complexity.

00:06:02.352 --> 00:06:05.689
That kind of thinking can't be done fast.

00:06:05.713 --> 00:06:07.595
That's slow thinking.

00:06:08.218 --> 00:06:11.280
Two psychologists,
Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky,

00:06:11.304 --> 00:06:14.529
started pointing this out back in 1974,

00:06:14.553 --> 00:06:17.999
and we're still struggling
to do something with their insights.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.770
All of modern history can be thought of as
one spurt of acceleration after another.

00:06:23.794 --> 00:06:26.131
It's as if we think
if we just speed up enough,

00:06:26.155 --> 00:06:28.166
we can outrun our problems.

00:06:28.797 --> 00:06:30.330
But we never do.

00:06:30.354 --> 00:06:32.155
We know this in our own lives,

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:34.390
and policymakers know it, too.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.247
So now we're turning
to artificial intelligence

00:06:37.271 --> 00:06:39.680
to help us make faster
and smarter decisions

00:06:39.704 --> 00:06:43.208
to process this ever-expanding
universe of data.

00:06:44.412 --> 00:06:47.824
But machines crunching data
are no substitute

00:06:47.848 --> 00:06:50.290
for critical and sustained thinking

00:06:50.314 --> 00:06:51.524
by humans,

00:06:51.548 --> 00:06:56.409
whose Stone Age brains need a little time
to let their impulses subside,

00:06:56.433 --> 00:06:58.140
to slow the mind

00:06:58.164 --> 00:06:59.876
and let the thoughts flow.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.212
If you're starting to think
that we should just hit the brakes,

00:07:04.236 --> 00:07:07.389
that won't always be the right solution.

00:07:07.413 --> 00:07:11.510
We all know that a train that's going
too fast around a bend can derail,

00:07:11.534 --> 00:07:13.496
but Seifu, the engineer,

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.241
taught me that a train that's going
too slowly around a bend can also derail.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.813
So managing this spurt of acceleration
starts with the understanding

00:07:23.837 --> 00:07:27.373
that we have more control over speed
than we think we do,

00:07:27.397 --> 00:07:30.578
individually and as a society.

00:07:30.602 --> 00:07:33.880
Sometimes, we'll need to engineer
ourselves to go faster.

00:07:33.904 --> 00:07:35.711
We'll want to solve gridlock,

00:07:35.735 --> 00:07:38.390
speed up disaster relief
for hurricane victims

00:07:38.414 --> 00:07:41.832
or use 3-D printing to produce
what we need on the spot,

00:07:41.856 --> 00:07:43.279
just when we need it.

00:07:43.955 --> 00:07:47.896
Sometimes, though, we'll want
to make our surroundings feel slower

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.307
to engineer the crash
out of the speedy experience.

00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:55.737
And it's OK not to be
stimulated all the time.

00:07:55.761 --> 00:07:57.267
It's good for adults

00:07:57.291 --> 00:07:58.568
and for kids.

00:07:59.043 --> 00:08:02.626
Maybe it's boring,
but it gives us time to reflect.

00:08:03.258 --> 00:08:06.738
Slow time is not wasted time.

00:08:08.142 --> 00:08:11.891
And we need to reconsider
what it means to save time.

00:08:12.318 --> 00:08:16.195
Culture and rituals around the world
build in slowness,

00:08:16.219 --> 00:08:20.781
because slowness helps us reinforce
our shared values and connect.

00:08:20.805 --> 00:08:24.062
And connection is
a critical part of being human.

00:08:25.387 --> 00:08:27.031
We need to master speed,

00:08:27.055 --> 00:08:31.234
and that means thinking carefully about
the trade-offs of any given technology.

00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:36.046
Will it help you reclaim time that you
can use to express your humanity?

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.856
Will it give you hurry sickness?
Will it give other people hurry sickness?

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.402
If you're lucky enough to decide the pace
that you want to travel through life,

00:08:44.426 --> 00:08:45.831
it's a privilege.

00:08:46.464 --> 00:08:47.615
Use it.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.967
You might decide that you need
both to speed up

00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:52.994
and to create slow time:

00:08:53.869 --> 00:08:55.599
time to reflect,

00:08:55.623 --> 00:08:57.252
to percolate

00:08:57.276 --> 00:08:58.718
at your own pace;

00:08:59.688 --> 00:09:00.943
time to listen,

00:09:01.611 --> 00:09:02.951
to empathize,

00:09:03.517 --> 00:09:05.059
to rest your mind,

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:07.818
to linger at the dinner table.

00:09:09.402 --> 00:09:11.387
So as we zoom into the future,

00:09:11.411 --> 00:09:15.172
let's consider setting
the technologies of speed,

00:09:15.196 --> 00:09:17.077
the purpose of speed

00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:19.796
and our expectations of speed

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.079
to a more human pace.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.913
Thank you.

00:09:23.937 --> 00:09:25.452
(Applause)
