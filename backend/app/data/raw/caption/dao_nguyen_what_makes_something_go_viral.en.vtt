00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:16.410
Last year, some BuzzFeed
employees were scheming

00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:18.764
to prank their boss, Ze Frank,

00:00:19.415 --> 00:00:20.657
on his birthday.

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:25.523
They decided to put a family
of baby goats in his office.

00:00:25.547 --> 00:00:26.952
(Laughter)

00:00:26.976 --> 00:00:31.397
Now, BuzzFeed had recently signed on
to the Facebook Live experiment,

00:00:31.421 --> 00:00:32.792
and so naturally,

00:00:32.816 --> 00:00:36.698
we decided to livestream
the whole event on the internet

00:00:36.722 --> 00:00:40.022
to capture the moment
when Ze would walk in

00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:43.008
and discover livestock in his office.

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.183
We thought the whole thing
would last maybe 10 minutes,

00:00:47.207 --> 00:00:51.731
and a few hundred company employees
would log in for the inside joke.

00:00:52.132 --> 00:00:53.395
But what happened?

00:00:53.977 --> 00:00:55.695
Ze kept on getting delayed:

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.205
he went to get a drink,

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:58.677
he was called to a meeting,

00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:00.444
the meeting ran long,

00:01:00.468 --> 00:01:01.633
he went to the bathroom.

00:01:01.657 --> 00:01:05.877
More and more people
started logging in to watch the goats.

00:01:06.493 --> 00:01:10.506
By the time Ze walked in
more than 30 minutes later,

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.636
90,000 viewers were watching
the livestream.

00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:20.558
Now, our team had a lot
of discussion about this video

00:01:20.582 --> 00:01:22.558
and why it was so successful.

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:25.458
It wasn't the biggest live video
that we had done to date.

00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:29.124
The biggest one that we had done
involved a fountain of cheese.

00:01:30.063 --> 00:01:33.888
But it performed so much better
than we had expected.

00:01:33.912 --> 00:01:38.175
What was it about the goats in the office
that we didn't anticipate?

00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:42.839
Now, a reasonable person could have
any number of hypotheses.

00:01:42.863 --> 00:01:45.281
Maybe people love baby animals.

00:01:45.751 --> 00:01:47.475
Maybe people love office pranks.

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:50.244
Maybe people love stories
about their bosses

00:01:50.268 --> 00:01:51.801
or birthday surprises.

00:01:52.382 --> 00:01:56.082
But our team wasn't really thinking
about what the video was about.

00:01:56.106 --> 00:01:57.378
We were thinking about

00:01:57.402 --> 00:02:01.478
what the people watching the video
were thinking and feeling.

00:02:01.502 --> 00:02:06.285
We read some of the 82,000 comments
that were made during the video,

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:10.101
and we hypothesized that they were excited

00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:13.299
because they were participating
in the shared anticipation

00:02:13.323 --> 00:02:16.053
of something that was about to happen.

00:02:16.077 --> 00:02:19.289
They were part of a community,
just for an instant,

00:02:19.313 --> 00:02:20.666
and it made them happy.

00:02:21.102 --> 00:02:24.446
So we decided that we needed
to test this hypothesis.

00:02:24.793 --> 00:02:28.275
What could we do to test
this very same thing?

00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:30.386
The following week,

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.085
armed with the additional knowledge
that food videos are very popular,

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.680
we dressed two people in hazmat suits

00:02:38.704 --> 00:02:42.965
and wrapped rubber bands
around a watermelon until it exploded.

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.570
(Laughter)

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:48.261
Eight hundred thousand people watched

00:02:48.285 --> 00:02:52.316
the 690th rubber band
explode the watermelon,

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.793
marking it as the biggest
Facebook Live event to date.

00:02:56.483 --> 00:02:59.093
The question I get most frequently is:

00:02:59.117 --> 00:03:00.950
How do you make something go viral?

00:03:01.713 --> 00:03:03.919
The question itself is misplaced;

00:03:03.943 --> 00:03:05.636
it's not about the something.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.957
It's about what the people
doing the something,

00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:10.184
reading or watching --

00:03:10.208 --> 00:03:11.488
what are they thinking?

00:03:11.841 --> 00:03:15.187
Now, most media companies,
when they think about metadata,

00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:17.594
they think about subjects or formats.

00:03:18.412 --> 00:03:19.562
It's about goats,

00:03:19.586 --> 00:03:21.362
it's about office pranks,

00:03:21.386 --> 00:03:22.683
it's about food,

00:03:22.707 --> 00:03:24.561
it's a list or a video or a quiz,

00:03:24.585 --> 00:03:25.844
it's 2,000 words long,

00:03:25.868 --> 00:03:27.021
it's 15 minutes long,

00:03:27.045 --> 00:03:30.167
it has 23 embedded tweets or 15 images.

00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:33.203
Now, that kind of metadata
is mildly interesting,

00:03:33.227 --> 00:03:36.193
but it doesn't actually get at
what really matters.

00:03:36.217 --> 00:03:40.375
What if, instead of tagging
what articles or videos are about,

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:41.589
what if we asked:

00:03:41.613 --> 00:03:45.166
How is it helping our users
do a real job in their lives?

00:03:46.173 --> 00:03:48.993
Last year, we started a project

00:03:49.017 --> 00:03:51.949
to formally categorize
our content in this way.

00:03:51.973 --> 00:03:54.720
We called it, "cultural cartography."

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.722
It formalized an informal practice
that we've had for a really long time:

00:03:59.746 --> 00:04:01.972
don't just think about the subject matter;

00:04:01.996 --> 00:04:05.164
think also about, and in fact,
primarily about,

00:04:05.188 --> 00:04:08.927
the job that your content is doing
for the reader or the viewer.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.956
Let me show you the map
that we have today.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.822
Each bubble is a specific job,

00:04:14.846 --> 00:04:19.616
and each group of bubbles
in a specific color are related jobs.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.118
First up: humor.

00:04:21.918 --> 00:04:23.079
"Makes me laugh."

00:04:23.103 --> 00:04:25.891
There are so many ways
to make somebody laugh.

00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:27.432
You can be laughing at someone,

00:04:27.456 --> 00:04:29.611
you could laugh
at specific internet humor,

00:04:29.635 --> 00:04:33.027
you could be laughing at some good,
clean, inoffensive dad jokes.

00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:36.006
"This is me." Identity.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.838
People are increasingly using media
to explain, "This is who I am.

00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:42.061
This is my upbringing, this is my culture,

00:04:42.085 --> 00:04:44.423
this is my fandom,
this is my guilty pleasure,

00:04:44.447 --> 00:04:46.630
and this is how I laugh about myself."

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.482
"Helps me connect with another person."

00:04:50.506 --> 00:04:52.917
This is one of the greatest
gifts of the internet.

00:04:52.941 --> 00:04:55.132
It's amazing when you find
a piece of media

00:04:55.156 --> 00:04:57.688
that precisely describes
your bond with someone.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.618
This is the group of jobs
that helps me do something --

00:05:01.642 --> 00:05:03.019
helps me settle an argument,

00:05:03.043 --> 00:05:05.716
helps me learn something
about myself or another person,

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.596
or helps me explain my story.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.309
This is the group of jobs
that makes me feel something --

00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:13.490
makes me curious or sad
or restores my faith in humanity.

00:05:13.514 --> 00:05:17.233
Many media companies
and creators do put themselves

00:05:17.257 --> 00:05:18.725
in their audiences' shoes.

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:21.453
But in the age of social media,
we can go much farther.

00:05:22.056 --> 00:05:26.118
People are connected to each other
on Facebook, on Twitter,

00:05:26.142 --> 00:05:30.405
and they're increasingly using media
to have a conversation

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:31.883
and to talk to each other.

00:05:31.907 --> 00:05:37.743
If we can be a part of establishing
a deeper connection between two people,

00:05:37.767 --> 00:05:40.956
then we will have done
a real job for these people.

00:05:41.394 --> 00:05:43.983
Let me give you some examples
of how this plays out.

00:05:44.578 --> 00:05:46.469
This is one of my favorite lists:

00:05:46.493 --> 00:05:49.796
"32 Memes You Should
Send Your Sister Immediately" --

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.122
immediately.

00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:54.687
For example, "When you're going
through your sister's stuff,

00:05:54.711 --> 00:05:56.690
and you hear her coming up the stairs."

00:05:56.714 --> 00:05:58.504
Absolutely, I've done that.

00:05:58.528 --> 00:06:01.683
"Watching your sister get in trouble
for something that you did

00:06:01.707 --> 00:06:02.899
and blamed on her."

00:06:02.923 --> 00:06:04.531
Yes, I've done that as well.

00:06:04.555 --> 00:06:06.354
This list got three million views.

00:06:06.378 --> 00:06:07.543
Why is that?

00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:10.543
Because it did, very well, several jobs:

00:06:10.567 --> 00:06:12.087
"This is us."

00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:13.376
"Connect with family."

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.581
"Makes me laugh."

00:06:14.605 --> 00:06:17.739
Here are some of the thousands
and thousands of comments

00:06:17.763 --> 00:06:20.612
that sisters sent to each other
using this list.

00:06:21.508 --> 00:06:25.019
Sometimes we discover
what jobs do after the fact.

00:06:25.592 --> 00:06:30.730
This quiz, "Pick an Outfit and We'll Guess
Your Exact Age and Height,"

00:06:30.754 --> 00:06:32.817
went very viral: 10 million views.

00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:34.017
Ten million views.

00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:38.567
I mean -- did we actually determine
the exact age and height

00:06:38.591 --> 00:06:40.175
of 10 million people?

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:42.461
That's incredible. It's incredible.

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:43.729
In fact, we didn't.

00:06:43.753 --> 00:06:44.882
(Laughter)

00:06:44.906 --> 00:06:48.999
Turns out that this quiz
went extremely viral

00:06:49.023 --> 00:06:52.586
among a group of 55-and-up women --

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.782
(Laughter)

00:06:53.806 --> 00:06:57.455
who were surprised and delighted

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:03.197
that BuzzFeed determined
that they were 28 and 5'9".

00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:04.831
(Laughter)

00:07:04.855 --> 00:07:08.063
"They put me at 34 years younger
and seven inches taller.

00:07:08.087 --> 00:07:11.035
I dress for comfort and do not give
a damn what anyone says.

00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:12.838
Age is a state of mind."

00:07:12.862 --> 00:07:15.912
This quiz was successful
not because it was accurate,

00:07:15.936 --> 00:07:19.990
but because it allowed these ladies
to do a very important job --

00:07:20.014 --> 00:07:21.218
the humblebrag.

00:07:22.478 --> 00:07:27.461
Now, we can even apply
this framework to recipes and food.

00:07:27.887 --> 00:07:33.460
A recipe's normal job is to tell you
what to make for dinner or for lunch.

00:07:34.205 --> 00:07:37.613
And this is how you would normally
brainstorm for a recipe:

00:07:37.637 --> 00:07:39.960
you figure out what ingredients
you want to use,

00:07:39.984 --> 00:07:41.152
what recipe that makes,

00:07:41.176 --> 00:07:44.421
and then maybe you slap a job on
at the end to sell it.

00:07:44.445 --> 00:07:48.812
But what if we flipped it around
and thought about the job first?

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:54.395
One brainstorming session
involved the job of bonding.

00:07:54.976 --> 00:07:59.276
So, could we make a recipe
that brought people together?

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.721
This is not a normal brainstorming
process at a food publisher.

00:08:05.532 --> 00:08:08.247
So we know that people
like to bake together,

00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:11.556
and we know that people
like to do challenges together,

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:16.313
so we decided to come up with a recipe
that involved those two things,

00:08:16.337 --> 00:08:18.248
and we challenged ourselves:

00:08:18.272 --> 00:08:20.078
Could we get people to say,

00:08:20.102 --> 00:08:24.188
"Hey, BFF, let's see
if we can do this together"?

00:08:24.807 --> 00:08:28.142
The resulting video was
the "Fudgiest Brownies Ever" video.

00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:31.090
It was enormously successful
in every metric possible --

00:08:31.114 --> 00:08:32.478
70 million views.

00:08:32.935 --> 00:08:36.635
And people said the exact things
that we were going after:

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:39.759
"Hey, Colette, we need to make these,
are you up for a challenge?"

00:08:39.783 --> 00:08:40.936
"Game on."

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.230
It did the job that it set out to do,

00:08:43.254 --> 00:08:47.370
which was to bring people together
over baking and chocolate.

00:08:49.294 --> 00:08:53.218
I'm really excited about
the potential for this project.

00:08:53.242 --> 00:08:56.384
When we talk about this framework
with our content creators,

00:08:56.408 --> 00:08:57.573
they instantly get it,

00:08:57.597 --> 00:09:00.330
no matter what beat they cover,
what country they’re in,

00:09:00.354 --> 00:09:01.719
or what language they speak.

00:09:01.743 --> 00:09:06.120
So cultural cartography has helped us
massively scale our workforce training.

00:09:06.621 --> 00:09:10.271
When we talk about this project
and this framework

00:09:10.295 --> 00:09:11.667
with advertisers and brands,

00:09:11.691 --> 00:09:13.269
they also instantly get it,

00:09:13.293 --> 00:09:18.919
because advertisers,
more often than media companies,

00:09:18.943 --> 00:09:22.465
understand how important it is
to understand the job

00:09:22.489 --> 00:09:24.935
that their products
are doing for customers.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.323
But the reason I'm the most excited
about this project

00:09:30.347 --> 00:09:34.218
is because it changes the relationship
between media and data.

00:09:35.051 --> 00:09:38.485
Most media companies
think of media as "mine."

00:09:39.547 --> 00:09:40.754
How many fans do I have?

00:09:40.778 --> 00:09:42.375
How many followers have I gained?

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:44.106
How many views have I gotten?

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.907
How many unique IDs do I have
in my data warehouse?

00:09:47.372 --> 00:09:51.320
But that misses the true value of data,
which is that it's yours.

00:09:53.166 --> 00:09:59.264
If we can capture in data
what really matters to you,

00:09:59.288 --> 00:10:03.776
and if we can understand more
the role that our work plays

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.189
in your actual life,

00:10:05.213 --> 00:10:08.076
the better content we can create for you,

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.957
and the better that we can reach you.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.035
Who are you?

00:10:13.293 --> 00:10:14.873
How did you get there?

00:10:14.897 --> 00:10:16.106
Where are you going?

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:17.399
What do you care about?

00:10:17.423 --> 00:10:18.802
What can you teach us?

00:10:19.151 --> 00:10:20.611
That's cultural cartography.

00:10:21.146 --> 00:10:22.302
Thank you.

00:10:22.326 --> 00:10:25.706
