00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:15.572
The creative process -- you know this --

00:00:15.596 --> 00:00:17.807
from the first idea to the final product,

00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:19.624
is a long process.

00:00:19.648 --> 00:00:22.387
It's super-iterative, lots of refinement,

00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:24.484
blood, sweat, tears and years.

00:00:24.508 --> 00:00:27.067
And we're not saying
you're going to go out for a walk

00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:29.782
and come back with the Sistine Chapel
in your left hand.

00:00:29.806 --> 00:00:32.494
So what frame of the creative
process did we focus on?

00:00:32.518 --> 00:00:33.984
Just this first part.

00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:36.577
Just brainstorming,
coming up with a new idea.

00:00:38.178 --> 00:00:41.984
We actually ran four studies
with a variety of people.

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:44.426
You were either walking
indoors or outdoors.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.038
And all of these studies
found the same conclusion.

00:00:48.062 --> 00:00:50.716
I'm only going to tell you
about one of them today.

00:00:51.156 --> 00:00:55.321
One of the tests we used for creativity
was alternate uses.

00:00:55.345 --> 00:00:57.080
In this test, you have four minutes.

00:00:57.104 --> 00:01:00.981
Your job is to come up with as many other
ways to use common everyday objects

00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:02.216
as you can think of.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.152
So, for example,
what else would you do with a key,

00:01:05.176 --> 00:01:07.593
other than to use it
for opening up a lock?

00:01:08.238 --> 00:01:12.226
Clearly, you could use it
as a third eyeball for a giraffe, right?

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:17.327
Maybe. That's sort of interesting,
kind of new. But is it creative?

00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:20.452
So people came up with
as many ideas as they could,

00:01:20.476 --> 00:01:21.641
and we had to decide:

00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:23.265
Is this creative or not?

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:27.723
The definition of creativity
that a lot of people go with

00:01:27.747 --> 00:01:29.392
is "appropriate novelty."

00:01:29.416 --> 00:01:32.487
For something to be appropriate,
it has to be realistic,

00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:36.376
so unfortunately, you can't use
a key as an eyeball.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.568
Boo!

00:01:37.592 --> 00:01:42.439
But "novel," the second thing,
is that nobody had to have said it.

00:01:42.463 --> 00:01:45.367
So for us, it had to be appropriate first,

00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:46.934
and then for novelty,

00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:50.743
nobody else in the entire population
that we surveyed could have said it.

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:54.466
So you might think you could use
a key to scratch somebody's car,

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.405
but if somebody else said that,
you didn't get credit for it.

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:58.604
Neither of you did.

00:01:58.628 --> 00:02:01.607
However, only one person said this:

00:02:02.592 --> 00:02:05.474
"If you were dying
and it were a murder mystery,

00:02:05.498 --> 00:02:08.492
and you had to carve the name
of the murderer into the ground

00:02:08.516 --> 00:02:10.103
with your dying words."

00:02:10.127 --> 00:02:11.810
One person said this.

00:02:11.834 --> 00:02:12.935
(Laughter)

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.244
And it's a creative idea,
because it's appropriate and it's novel.

00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:19.672
You either did this test and came up
with ideas while you were seated

00:02:19.696 --> 00:02:22.248
or while you were walking on a treadmill.

00:02:22.272 --> 00:02:23.540
(Laughter)

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:26.940
They did the test twice,
with different objects.

00:02:26.964 --> 00:02:30.047
Three groups: the first group sat first

00:02:30.071 --> 00:02:32.914
and then sat again for the second test.

00:02:32.938 --> 00:02:35.496
The second group sat first

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.863
and then did the second test
while walking on a treadmill.

00:02:38.887 --> 00:02:41.036
The third group --
and this is interesting --

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.008
they walked on the treadmill first,
and then they sat.

00:02:44.762 --> 00:02:48.520
OK, so the two groups
that sat together for the first test,

00:02:48.544 --> 00:02:50.605
they looked pretty similar to each other,

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.578
and they averaged
about 20 creative ideas per person.

00:02:54.157 --> 00:02:56.574
The group that was walking
on the treadmill

00:02:56.598 --> 00:02:58.411
did almost twice as well.

00:02:59.071 --> 00:03:02.419
And they were just walking
on a treadmill in a windowless room.

00:03:04.556 --> 00:03:06.788
Remember, they took the test twice.

00:03:06.812 --> 00:03:10.506
The people who sat twice for that second
test didn't get any better;

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.738
practice didn't help.

00:03:12.313 --> 00:03:15.648
But these same people who were sitting
and then went on the treadmill

00:03:15.672 --> 00:03:17.301
got a boost from walking.

00:03:17.325 --> 00:03:18.852
Here's the interesting thing.

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:21.623
The people who were
walking on the treadmill

00:03:21.647 --> 00:03:24.408
still had a residue effect of the walking,

00:03:24.432 --> 00:03:26.338
and they were still creative afterwards.

00:03:26.362 --> 00:03:29.487
So the implication of this
is that you should go for a walk

00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:33.168
before your next big meeting
and just start brainstorming right away.

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:36.185
We have five tips for you

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.968
that will help make this
the best effect possible.

00:03:39.992 --> 00:03:44.512
First, you want to pick a problem
or a topic to brainstorm.

00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:46.645
So, this is not the shower effect,

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.861
when you're in the shower
and all of a sudden,

00:03:48.885 --> 00:03:50.924
a new idea pops out of the shampoo bottle.

00:03:50.948 --> 00:03:53.527
This is something
you're thinking about ahead of time.

00:03:53.551 --> 00:03:57.114
They're intentionally thinking about
brainstorming a different perspective

00:03:57.138 --> 00:03:58.468
on the walk.

00:03:58.492 --> 00:04:00.358
Secondly -- I get asked this a lot:

00:04:00.382 --> 00:04:02.353
Is this OK while running?

00:04:02.377 --> 00:04:05.195
Well, the answer for me
is that if I were running,

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:09.545
the only new idea I would have
would be to stop running, so ...

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:10.861
(Laughter)

00:04:10.885 --> 00:04:14.006
But if running for you
is a comfortable pace, good.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.588
It turns out, whatever physical
activity is not taking a lot of attention.

00:04:18.612 --> 00:04:21.411
So just walking at a comfortable
pace is a good choice.

00:04:22.576 --> 00:04:25.342
Also, you want to come up with
as many ideas as you can.

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:28.814
One key of creativity
is to not lock on that first idea.

00:04:28.838 --> 00:04:30.089
Keep going.

00:04:30.113 --> 00:04:33.849
Keep coming up with new ones,
until you pick one or two to pursue.

00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:38.104
You might worry that you don't want
to write them down,

00:04:38.128 --> 00:04:39.963
because what if you forget them?

00:04:39.987 --> 00:04:41.872
So the idea here is to speak them.

00:04:41.896 --> 00:04:43.848
Everybody was speaking their new ideas.

00:04:43.872 --> 00:04:47.612
So you can put your headphones on
and record through your phone

00:04:47.636 --> 00:04:50.899
and then just pretend you're having
a creative conversation, right?

00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:53.985
Because the act of writing
your idea down is already a filter.

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:56.953
You're going to be like,
"Is this good enough to write down?"

00:04:56.977 --> 00:04:58.304
And then you write it down.

00:04:58.328 --> 00:05:01.888
So just speak as many as you can,
record them and think about them later.

00:05:01.912 --> 00:05:04.354
And finally: don't do this forever. Right?

00:05:04.378 --> 00:05:07.264
If you're on the walk
and that idea's not coming to you,

00:05:07.288 --> 00:05:09.304
come back to it later at another time.

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:12.841
I think we're coming up
on a break right now,

00:05:12.865 --> 00:05:14.306
so I have an idea:

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.040
Why don't you grab a leash

00:05:16.064 --> 00:05:18.275
and take your thoughts for a walk?

00:05:19.775 --> 00:05:20.937
Thank you.

00:05:20.961 --> 00:05:23.641
(Applause)
