00:00:12.643 --> 00:00:14.691
How many of you
have ever heard someone say

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:15.881
privacy is dead?

00:00:15.905 --> 00:00:17.055
Raise your hand.

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.309
How many of you have heard someone say

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:24.267
they don't care about their privacy
because they don't have anything to hide?

00:00:24.665 --> 00:00:25.825
Go on.

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:27.291
(Laughter)

00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:31.977
Now, how many of you
use any kind of encryption software?

00:00:32.283 --> 00:00:33.434
Raise your hand.

00:00:33.458 --> 00:00:36.805
Or a password
to protect an online account?

00:00:37.529 --> 00:00:41.449
Or curtains or blinds
on your windows at home?

00:00:41.473 --> 00:00:43.029
(Laughter)

00:00:43.053 --> 00:00:45.086
OK, so that's everyone, I think.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.260
(Laughter)

00:00:46.752 --> 00:00:48.752
So why do you do these things?

00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:50.316
My guess is,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.728
it's because you care about your privacy.

00:00:52.752 --> 00:00:55.751
The idea that privacy is dead is a myth.

00:00:55.775 --> 00:00:58.513
The idea that people
don't care about their privacy

00:00:58.537 --> 00:01:00.237
because "they have nothing to hide"

00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:01.903
or they've done nothing wrong

00:01:01.927 --> 00:01:03.170
is also a myth.

00:01:04.433 --> 00:01:08.496
I'm guessing that you would not want
to publicly share on the internet,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.932
for the world to see,

00:01:09.956 --> 00:01:11.758
all of your medical records.

00:01:11.782 --> 00:01:15.218
Or your search histories
from your phone or your computer.

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:17.495
And I bet

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:20.193
that if the government
wanted to put a chip in your brain

00:01:20.217 --> 00:01:24.855
to transmit every one of your thoughts
to a centralized government computer,

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:26.364
you would balk at that.

00:01:26.388 --> 00:01:28.823
(Laughter)

00:01:28.847 --> 00:01:30.855
That's because you care
about your privacy,

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:32.412
like every human being.

00:01:33.347 --> 00:01:36.091
So, our world has changed fast.

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:40.228
And today, there is understandably
a lot of confusion

00:01:40.252 --> 00:01:43.394
about what privacy is and why it matters.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.124
Privacy is not secrecy.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.656
It's control.

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:52.737
I share information with my doctor
about my body and my health,

00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:55.237
expecting that she is not
going to turn around

00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:58.371
and share that information
with my parents,

00:01:58.395 --> 00:02:00.521
or my boss or my kids.

00:02:01.585 --> 00:02:04.124
That information is private, not secret.

00:02:05.085 --> 00:02:08.342
I'm in control over how
that information is shared.

00:02:09.686 --> 00:02:12.845
You've probably heard people say
that there's a fundamental tension

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:14.631
between privacy on the one hand

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:16.678
and safety on the other.

00:02:17.963 --> 00:02:20.495
But the technologies
that advance our privacy

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.098
also advance our safety.

00:02:22.122 --> 00:02:24.543
Think about fences, door locks,

00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:27.320
curtains on our windows, passwords,

00:02:27.344 --> 00:02:28.677
encryption software.

00:02:29.522 --> 00:02:31.013
All of these technologies

00:02:31.037 --> 00:02:35.362
simultaneously protect
our privacy and our safety.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.403
Dragnet surveillance,
on the other hand, protects neither.

00:02:41.486 --> 00:02:42.652
In recent years,

00:02:42.676 --> 00:02:45.597
the federal government
tasked a group of experts

00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:48.557
called The Privacy and Civil Liberties
Oversight Board

00:02:48.581 --> 00:02:51.903
with examining post-9/11
government surveillance programs,

00:02:51.927 --> 00:02:53.883
dragnet surveillance programs.

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:57.442
Those experts could not find
a single example

00:02:57.466 --> 00:03:01.250
of that dragnet surveillance
advancing any safety --

00:03:01.274 --> 00:03:04.141
didn't identify or stop
a single terrorist attack.

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:08.250
You know what that information
was useful for, though?

00:03:08.274 --> 00:03:11.431
Helping NSA employees
spy on their romantic interests.

00:03:11.455 --> 00:03:12.596
(Laughter)

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.921
(Audience: Wow.)

00:03:14.892 --> 00:03:16.582
Another example is closer to home.

00:03:16.606 --> 00:03:19.464
So millions of people
across the United States and the world

00:03:19.488 --> 00:03:21.776
are adopting so-called
"smart home" devices,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.363
like internet-connected
surveillance cameras.

00:03:24.712 --> 00:03:27.974
But we know that any technology
connected to the internet

00:03:27.998 --> 00:03:29.148
can be hacked.

00:03:30.514 --> 00:03:32.228
And so if a hacker

00:03:32.252 --> 00:03:35.554
gets into your internet-connected
surveillance camera at home,

00:03:35.578 --> 00:03:38.276
they can watch you
and your family coming and going,

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.748
finding just the right time to strike.

00:03:41.553 --> 00:03:43.862
You know what can't be hacked remotely?

00:03:44.418 --> 00:03:45.574
Curtains.

00:03:45.598 --> 00:03:46.599
(Laughter)

00:03:46.623 --> 00:03:48.037
Fences.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.221
Door locks.

00:03:49.245 --> 00:03:50.386
(Laughter)

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.756
Privacy is not the enemy of safety.

00:03:53.113 --> 00:03:54.565
It is its guarantor.

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.114
Nonetheless, we daily face
a propaganda onslaught

00:04:00.138 --> 00:04:04.228
telling us that we have to give up
some privacy in exchange for safety

00:04:04.252 --> 00:04:06.252
through surveillance programs.

00:04:07.085 --> 00:04:11.084
Face surveillance is the most dangerous
of these technologies.

00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:17.133
There are two primary ways today
governments use technologies like this.

00:04:17.157 --> 00:04:18.910
One is face recognition.

00:04:19.243 --> 00:04:21.514
That's to identify someone in an image.

00:04:21.538 --> 00:04:24.371
The second is face surveillance,

00:04:24.395 --> 00:04:26.450
which can be used in concert

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:29.330
with surveillance-camera
networks and databases

00:04:29.354 --> 00:04:32.831
to create records of all people's
public movements,

00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:35.260
habits and associations,

00:04:35.284 --> 00:04:38.196
effectively creating a digital panopticon.

00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:40.760
This is a panopticon.

00:04:40.784 --> 00:04:45.006
It's a prison designed to allow
a few guards in the center

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.974
to monitor everything happening
in the cells around the perimeter.

00:04:49.482 --> 00:04:54.149
The people in those prison cells
can't see inside the guard tower,

00:04:54.173 --> 00:04:57.839
but the guards can see
into every inch of those cells.

00:04:59.268 --> 00:05:01.323
The idea here

00:05:01.347 --> 00:05:03.942
is that if the people
in those prison cells

00:05:03.966 --> 00:05:05.895
know they're being watched all the time,

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.379
or could be,

00:05:07.403 --> 00:05:09.371
they'll behave accordingly.

00:05:09.395 --> 00:05:13.169
Similarly, face surveillance
enables a centralized authority --

00:05:13.193 --> 00:05:15.077
in this case, the state --

00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:18.458
to monitor the totality
of human movement and association

00:05:18.482 --> 00:05:19.632
in public space.

00:05:20.053 --> 00:05:21.450
And here's what it looks like

00:05:21.474 --> 00:05:22.846
in real life.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.672
In this case, it's not a guard in a tower,

00:05:25.696 --> 00:05:28.974
but rather a police analyst
in a spy center.

00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:32.656
The prison expands beyond its walls,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.562
encompassing everyone,

00:05:34.586 --> 00:05:37.077
everywhere, all the time.

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:39.498
In a free society,

00:05:39.522 --> 00:05:41.926
this should terrify us all.

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:46.317
For decades now, we've watched cop shows

00:05:46.341 --> 00:05:48.063
that push a narrative that says

00:05:48.087 --> 00:05:51.827
technologies like face surveillance
ultimately serve the public good.

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.619
But real life is not a cop drama.

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:58.117
The bad guy didn't always do it,

00:05:58.141 --> 00:06:01.410
the cops definitely
aren't always the good guys

00:06:01.434 --> 00:06:04.034
and the technology doesn't always work.

00:06:04.602 --> 00:06:06.498
Take the case of Steve Talley,

00:06:06.522 --> 00:06:09.014
a financial analyst from Colorado.

00:06:09.038 --> 00:06:12.943
In 2015, Talley was arrested,
and he was charged with bank robbery

00:06:12.967 --> 00:06:16.255
on the basis of an error
in a facial recognition system.

00:06:16.985 --> 00:06:18.168
Talley fought that case

00:06:18.192 --> 00:06:20.414
and he eventually was cleared
of those charges,

00:06:20.438 --> 00:06:23.032
but while he was being
persecuted by the state,

00:06:23.056 --> 00:06:26.567
he lost his house, his job and his kids.

00:06:27.941 --> 00:06:29.618
Steve Talley's case is an example

00:06:29.642 --> 00:06:32.143
of what can happen
when the technology fails.

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:37.467
But face surveillance is just as dangerous
when it works as advertized.

00:06:38.875 --> 00:06:41.693
Just consider how trivial it would be

00:06:41.717 --> 00:06:44.160
for a government agency
to put a surveillance camera

00:06:44.184 --> 00:06:48.128
outside a building where people meet
for Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.

00:06:49.194 --> 00:06:50.716
They could connect that camera

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.392
to a face-surveillance algorithm
and a database,

00:06:53.416 --> 00:06:55.343
press a button and sit back and collect

00:06:55.367 --> 00:06:58.587
a record of every person
receiving treatment for alcoholism.

00:07:00.204 --> 00:07:02.511
It would be just as easy
for a government agency

00:07:02.535 --> 00:07:05.164
to use this technology
to automatically identify

00:07:05.188 --> 00:07:07.569
every person who attended
the Women's March

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:09.726
or a Black Lives Matter protest.

00:07:11.163 --> 00:07:15.044
Even the technology industry
is aware of the gravity of this problem.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.300
Microsoft's president Brad Smith
has called on Congress to intervene.

00:07:21.188 --> 00:07:22.570
Google, for its part,

00:07:22.594 --> 00:07:26.196
has publicly declined
to ship a face surveillance product,

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.767
in part because of these grave
human and civil rights concerns.

00:07:30.514 --> 00:07:32.114
And that's a good thing.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.451
Because ultimately,

00:07:34.475 --> 00:07:37.976
protecting our open society
is much more important

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.467
than corporate profit.

00:07:41.078 --> 00:07:43.420
The ACLU's nationwide campaign

00:07:43.444 --> 00:07:45.372
to get the government to pump the brakes

00:07:45.396 --> 00:07:47.727
on the adoption
of this dangerous technology

00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:50.680
has prompted reasonable questions
from thoughtful people.

00:07:51.807 --> 00:07:55.473
What makes this technology
in particular so dangerous?

00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:58.028
Why can't we just regulate it?

00:07:58.052 --> 00:08:00.220
In short, why the alarm?

00:08:01.236 --> 00:08:05.648
Face surveillance is uniquely dangerous
for two related reasons.

00:08:06.133 --> 00:08:09.307
One is the nature
of the technology itself.

00:08:09.331 --> 00:08:11.603
And the second is that our system

00:08:11.627 --> 00:08:16.037
fundamentally lacks the oversight
and accountability mechanisms

00:08:16.061 --> 00:08:17.467
that would be necessary

00:08:17.491 --> 00:08:21.093
to ensure it would not be abused
in the government's hands.

00:08:22.562 --> 00:08:27.474
First, face surveillance enables
a totalizing form of surveillance

00:08:27.498 --> 00:08:28.965
never before possible.

00:08:30.006 --> 00:08:33.966
Every single person's every visit
to a friend's house,

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.553
a government office,

00:08:35.577 --> 00:08:37.664
a house of worship,

00:08:37.688 --> 00:08:39.101
a Planned Parenthood,

00:08:39.125 --> 00:08:40.625
a cannabis shop,

00:08:40.649 --> 00:08:42.116
a strip club;

00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:47.275
every single person's public movements,
habits and associations

00:08:47.299 --> 00:08:48.934
documented and catalogued,

00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:51.323
not on one day, but on every day,

00:08:51.347 --> 00:08:53.292
merely with the push of a button.

00:08:54.276 --> 00:08:57.418
This kind of totalizing mass surveillance

00:08:57.442 --> 00:09:00.474
fundamentally threatens
what it means to live in a free society.

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:03.227
Our freedom of speech,
freedom of association,

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:04.586
freedom of religion,

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:05.863
freedom of the press,

00:09:05.887 --> 00:09:07.101
our privacy,

00:09:07.125 --> 00:09:08.925
our right to be left alone.

00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:11.927
You may be thinking,

00:09:11.951 --> 00:09:15.286
"OK, come on, but there are tons
of ways the government can spy on us."

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:16.507
And yes, it's true,

00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:18.984
the government can track us
through our cell phones,

00:09:19.008 --> 00:09:22.640
but if I want to go to get an abortion,

00:09:22.664 --> 00:09:24.450
or attend a political meeting,

00:09:24.474 --> 00:09:28.752
or even just call in sick
and play hooky and go to the beach ...

00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:30.117
(Laughter)

00:09:30.141 --> 00:09:32.074
I can leave my phone at home.

00:09:33.101 --> 00:09:35.355
I cannot leave my face at home.

00:09:37.165 --> 00:09:39.704
And that brings me
to my second primary concern:

00:09:39.728 --> 00:09:43.055
How we might meaningfully
regulate this technology.

00:09:44.315 --> 00:09:48.029
Today, if the government wants to know
where I was last week,

00:09:48.053 --> 00:09:52.577
they can't just hop into a time machine
and go back in time and follow me.

00:09:53.585 --> 00:09:56.321
And they also, the local police right now,

00:09:56.345 --> 00:09:59.638
don't maintain any centralized
system of tracking,

00:09:59.662 --> 00:10:03.028
where they're cataloging every person's
public movements all the time,

00:10:03.052 --> 00:10:06.435
just in case that information
some day becomes useful.

00:10:06.783 --> 00:10:09.885
Today, if the government
wants to know where I was last week,

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:11.514
or last month or last year,

00:10:11.538 --> 00:10:13.898
they have to go to a judge, get a warrant

00:10:13.922 --> 00:10:16.212
and then serve that warrant
on my phone company,

00:10:16.236 --> 00:10:19.848
which by the way, has a financial interest
in protecting my privacy.

00:10:21.027 --> 00:10:22.654
With face surveillance,

00:10:22.678 --> 00:10:24.733
no such limitations exist.

00:10:25.226 --> 00:10:29.846
This is technology that is 100 percent
controlled by the government itself.

00:10:31.363 --> 00:10:35.330
So how would a warrant requirement
work in this context?

00:10:36.307 --> 00:10:38.307
Is the government going to go to a judge

00:10:38.331 --> 00:10:39.497
and get a warrant,

00:10:39.521 --> 00:10:41.536
and then serve the warrant on themselves?

00:10:42.109 --> 00:10:44.125
That would be like me giving you my diary,

00:10:44.149 --> 00:10:46.744
and saying, "Here,
you can hold on to this forever,

00:10:46.768 --> 00:10:49.406
but you can't read it
until I say it's OK."

00:10:50.102 --> 00:10:51.302
So what can we do?

00:10:53.221 --> 00:10:55.353
The only answer to the threat

00:10:55.377 --> 00:10:58.808
posed by the government's use
of face surveillance

00:10:58.832 --> 00:11:03.790
is to deny the government the capacity
to violate the public's trust,

00:11:03.814 --> 00:11:05.878
by denying the government the ability

00:11:05.902 --> 00:11:09.137
to build these in-house
face-surveillance networks.

00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:11.719
And that's exactly what we're doing.

00:11:12.567 --> 00:11:15.836
The ACLU is part of a nationwide campaign

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.566
to pump the brakes on the government's use
of this dangerous technology.

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:21.583
We've already been successful,

00:11:21.607 --> 00:11:24.721
from San Francisco
to Somerville, Massachusetts,

00:11:24.745 --> 00:11:26.872
we have passed municipal bans

00:11:26.896 --> 00:11:29.142
on the government's
use of this technology.

00:11:29.166 --> 00:11:31.714
And plenty of other communities
here in Massachusetts

00:11:31.738 --> 00:11:32.927
and across the country

00:11:32.951 --> 00:11:34.396
are debating similar measures.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.934
Some people have told me
that this movement is bound to fail.

00:11:38.625 --> 00:11:40.256
That ultimately,

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.355
merely because the technology exists,

00:11:42.379 --> 00:11:45.466
it will be deployed in every context

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.934
by every government everywhere.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.603
Privacy is dead, right?

00:11:52.388 --> 00:11:53.854
So the narrative goes.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:57.340
Well, I refuse to accept that narrative.

00:11:57.364 --> 00:11:58.630
And you should, too.

00:12:00.214 --> 00:12:04.007
We can't allow Jeff Bezos or the FBI

00:12:04.031 --> 00:12:08.190
to determine the boundaries
of our freedoms in the 21st century.

00:12:09.413 --> 00:12:11.562
If we live in a democracy,

00:12:11.586 --> 00:12:13.585
we are in the driver's seat,

00:12:13.609 --> 00:12:15.609
shaping our collective future.

00:12:16.704 --> 00:12:18.815
We are at a fork in the road right now.

00:12:19.379 --> 00:12:21.823
We can either continue
with business as usual,

00:12:21.847 --> 00:12:25.854
allowing governments to adopt and deploy
these technologies unchecked,

00:12:25.878 --> 00:12:29.195
in our communities, our streets
and our schools,

00:12:29.219 --> 00:12:34.108
or we can take bold action now

00:12:34.132 --> 00:12:38.465
to press pause on the government's use
of face surveillance,

00:12:38.489 --> 00:12:40.076
protect our privacy

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.187
and to build a safer, freer future

00:12:43.211 --> 00:12:44.568
for all of us.

00:12:44.592 --> 00:12:45.743
Thank you.

00:12:45.767 --> 00:12:48.194
(Applause and cheers)
