00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:14.492
Take a minute

00:00:14.516 --> 00:00:17.326
and think of yourself
as the leader of a country.

00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:21.325
And let's say one
of your biggest priorities

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.081
is to provide your citizens
with high-quality healthcare.

00:00:26.047 --> 00:00:27.928
How would you go about it?

00:00:27.952 --> 00:00:29.809
Build more hospitals?

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:31.904
Open more medical colleges?

00:00:31.928 --> 00:00:33.928
Invest in clinical innovation?

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.607
But what if your country's health system
was fundamentally broken?

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:41.679
Whether it's doctor absenteeism,

00:00:41.703 --> 00:00:44.718
drug stock-outs or poor quality of care.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.250
Where would you start then?

00:00:48.387 --> 00:00:50.188
I'm a management consultant,

00:00:50.212 --> 00:00:52.046
and for the last three years,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.045
I've been working on a project

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:57.569
to improve the public heath
system of Rajasthan,

00:00:57.593 --> 00:00:59.267
a state in India.

00:01:00.287 --> 00:01:02.572
And during the course of the project,

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:05.396
we actually discovered something profound.

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:11.490
More doctors, better facilities,
clinical innovation --

00:01:11.514 --> 00:01:13.047
they are all important.

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:17.847
But nothing changes
without one key ingredient.

00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:19.489
Motivation.

00:01:21.157 --> 00:01:23.450
But motivation is a tricky thing.

00:01:23.474 --> 00:01:29.807
If you've led a team, raised a child
or tried to change a personal habit,

00:01:29.831 --> 00:01:32.898
you know that motivation
doesn't just appear.

00:01:33.665 --> 00:01:36.660
Something has to change to make you care.

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.599
And if there's one thing
that all of us humans care about,

00:01:42.623 --> 00:01:47.033
it's an inherent desire
to shine in front of society.

00:01:47.992 --> 00:01:49.992
So that's exactly what we did.

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:53.524
We decided to focus on the citizen:

00:01:54.223 --> 00:01:58.868
the people who the system
was supposed to serve in the first place.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.593
And today, I'd like to tell you

00:02:02.617 --> 00:02:07.720
how Rajasthan has transformed
its public health system dramatically

00:02:07.744 --> 00:02:11.546
by using the citizen
to trigger motivation.

00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:17.093
Now, Rajasthan is one
of India's largest states,

00:02:17.117 --> 00:02:20.116
with a population of nearly 80 million.

00:02:20.927 --> 00:02:23.460
That's larger than the United Kingdom.

00:02:24.863 --> 00:02:27.530
But the similarities probably end there.

00:02:28.434 --> 00:02:31.689
In 2016, when my team was called in

00:02:31.713 --> 00:02:35.760
to start working with the public
health system of Rajasthan,

00:02:35.784 --> 00:02:38.450
we found it in a state of crisis.

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:42.900
For example, the neonatal
mortality rate --

00:02:42.924 --> 00:02:48.154
that's the number of newborns who die
before their first month birthday --

00:02:48.178 --> 00:02:51.767
was 10 times higher than that of the UK.

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.029
No wonder then that citizens were saying,

00:02:55.053 --> 00:02:58.225
"Hey, I don't want to go
to a public health facility."

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:03.795
In India, if you wanted to see a doctor
in a public health facility,

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.620
you would go to a "PHC,"
or "primary health center."

00:03:08.573 --> 00:03:13.799
And at least 40 patients
are expected to go to a PHC every day.

00:03:14.673 --> 00:03:18.760
But in Rajasthan,
only one out of four PHCs

00:03:18.784 --> 00:03:21.450
was seeing this minimum
number of patients.

00:03:21.474 --> 00:03:25.455
In other words, people
had lost faith in the system.

00:03:27.352 --> 00:03:29.519
When we delved deeper,

00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:34.209
we realized that lack of accountability
is at the core of it.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:36.660
Picture this.

00:03:37.153 --> 00:03:39.804
Sudha, a daily-wage earner,

00:03:39.828 --> 00:03:42.724
realizes that her one-year-old daughter

00:03:42.748 --> 00:03:45.548
is suffering from
uncontrollable dysentery.

00:03:46.337 --> 00:03:48.567
So she decides to take the day off.

00:03:48.591 --> 00:03:52.821
That's a loss of about
350 rupees or five dollars.

00:03:53.377 --> 00:03:56.180
And she picks up her daughter in her arms

00:03:56.204 --> 00:03:59.738
and walks for five kilometers
to the government PHC.

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:02.449
But the doctor isn't there.

00:04:03.903 --> 00:04:06.799
So she takes the next day off, again,

00:04:06.823 --> 00:04:08.557
and comes back to the PHC.

00:04:09.244 --> 00:04:11.312
This time, the doctor is there,

00:04:11.336 --> 00:04:13.062
but the pharmacist tells her

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:16.434
that the free drugs
that she's entitled to have run out,

00:04:16.458 --> 00:04:19.093
because they forgot
to reorder them on time.

00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:22.545
So now, she rushes
to the private medical center,

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:23.910
and as she's rushing there,

00:04:23.934 --> 00:04:28.101
looking at her daughter's condition
worsening with every passing hour,

00:04:28.125 --> 00:04:30.125
she can't help but wonder

00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:32.663
if she should have gone
to the private medical center

00:04:32.687 --> 00:04:33.863
in the first place

00:04:33.887 --> 00:04:38.621
and payed the 350 rupees
for the consultation and drugs.

00:04:40.654 --> 00:04:47.042
No one is held accountable
for this incredible failure of the system.

00:04:48.273 --> 00:04:53.512
Costing time, money
and heartache to Sudha.

00:04:55.945 --> 00:04:58.676
And this is something
that just had to be fixed.

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:02.318
Now, as all good consultants,

00:05:02.342 --> 00:05:05.763
we decided that data-driven reviews

00:05:05.787 --> 00:05:08.987
had to be the answer
to improve accountability.

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.397
So we created these fancy
performance dashboards

00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:16.318
to help make the review meetings
of the health department

00:05:16.342 --> 00:05:18.365
much more effective.

00:05:19.255 --> 00:05:20.588
But nothing changed.

00:05:21.604 --> 00:05:23.633
Discussion after discussion,

00:05:23.657 --> 00:05:26.077
meeting after meeting,

00:05:26.101 --> 00:05:28.373
nothing changed.

00:05:29.244 --> 00:05:31.331
And that's when it struck me.

00:05:31.355 --> 00:05:33.339
You see, public systems

00:05:33.363 --> 00:05:36.889
have always been governed
through internal mechanisms,

00:05:36.913 --> 00:05:39.135
like review meetings.

00:05:39.683 --> 00:05:41.119
And over time,

00:05:41.143 --> 00:05:44.793
their accountability to the citizen
has been diluted.

00:05:45.564 --> 00:05:49.091
So why not bring the citizen
back into the equation,

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:52.535
perhaps by using the citizen promises?

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:54.693
Couldn't that trigger motivation?

00:05:56.464 --> 00:06:00.699
We started with what I like to call
the coffee shop strategy.

00:06:01.454 --> 00:06:05.049
You've probably seen
one of these signs in a coffee shop,

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:06.319
which says,

00:06:06.343 --> 00:06:10.152
"If you don't get your receipt,
the coffee is free."

00:06:11.235 --> 00:06:14.473
Now, the cashier has no option

00:06:14.497 --> 00:06:17.425
but to give you a receipt each time.

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:23.027
So we took this strategy
and applied it to Rajasthan.

00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:25.710
We worked with the government

00:06:25.734 --> 00:06:31.154
on a program to revive 300 PHCs
across the state,

00:06:31.178 --> 00:06:36.583
and we got them to paint very clear
citizen promises along the wall.

00:06:37.718 --> 00:06:41.535
"We assure you that you will have
a doctor each time."

00:06:42.297 --> 00:06:45.564
"We assure you that you will get
your free drugs each time."

00:06:46.299 --> 00:06:47.529
"We assure you

00:06:47.553 --> 00:06:50.474
that you will get
your free diagnostics each time."

00:06:51.211 --> 00:06:54.609
And finally, we worked
with elected representatives

00:06:54.633 --> 00:06:57.829
to launch these revived PHCs,

00:06:57.853 --> 00:07:01.186
who shared the citizen promises
with the community

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.170
with a lot of fanfare.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.991
Now, the promise
was out there in the open.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.823
Failure would be embarrassing.

00:07:12.073 --> 00:07:14.406
The system had to start delivering.

00:07:16.207 --> 00:07:17.919
And deliver it did.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.188
Doctor availability went up,

00:07:21.212 --> 00:07:23.074
medicines came on hand,

00:07:23.098 --> 00:07:24.585
and as a result,

00:07:24.609 --> 00:07:29.053
patient visits went up by 20 percent
in less than a year.

00:07:30.252 --> 00:07:34.242
The public health system
was getting back into business.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:38.479
But there was still a long distance to go.

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:40.482
Change isn't that easy.

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:44.617
An exasperated doctor once told me,

00:07:44.641 --> 00:07:48.578
"I really want to transform
the maternal health in my community,

00:07:48.602 --> 00:07:51.069
but I just don't have enough nurses."

00:07:51.426 --> 00:07:53.845
Now, resources like nurses

00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:57.361
are actually controlled
by administrative officers

00:07:57.385 --> 00:07:59.119
who the doctors report to.

00:07:59.734 --> 00:08:02.163
And while the doctors were now motivated,

00:08:02.187 --> 00:08:06.052
the administrative officers
simply weren't motivated enough

00:08:06.076 --> 00:08:07.703
to help the doctors.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.227
This is where the head
of the public health department,

00:08:12.251 --> 00:08:15.393
Ms. Veenu Gupta, came up
with a brilliant idea.

00:08:16.188 --> 00:08:19.807
A monthly ranking of all districts.

00:08:20.304 --> 00:08:24.294
And this ranking would assess
the performance of every district

00:08:24.318 --> 00:08:26.180
on each major disease

00:08:26.204 --> 00:08:28.188
and each major procedure.

00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:30.844
But here's the best part.

00:08:30.868 --> 00:08:33.107
We made the ranking go public.

00:08:33.654 --> 00:08:35.718
We put the ranking on the website,

00:08:35.742 --> 00:08:38.082
we put the ranking on social media,

00:08:38.106 --> 00:08:41.006
and before you knew it,
the media got involved,

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.625
with newspaper articles
on which districts were doing well

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:46.182
and which ones weren't.

00:08:47.402 --> 00:08:49.919
And we didn't just want the rankings

00:08:49.943 --> 00:08:52.910
to impact the best-
and the worst-performing districts.

00:08:52.934 --> 00:08:56.678
We wanted the rankings
to motivate every district.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.601
So we took inspiration
from soccer leagues,

00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:04.244
and created a three-tiered ranking system,

00:09:04.268 --> 00:09:06.803
whereby every quarter,

00:09:06.827 --> 00:09:09.732
if a district's performance
were to decline,

00:09:09.756 --> 00:09:12.556
you could get relegated to the lower tier.

00:09:12.938 --> 00:09:15.799
But if the district's performance
were to improve,

00:09:15.823 --> 00:09:18.863
you could get promoted
to the premiere league.

00:09:19.538 --> 00:09:21.671
The rankings were a big success.

00:09:22.077 --> 00:09:24.458
It generated tremendous excitement,

00:09:24.482 --> 00:09:29.109
and districts began vying with each other
to be known as exemplars.

00:09:30.292 --> 00:09:33.001
It's actually very simple,
if you think about it.

00:09:33.329 --> 00:09:38.218
If the performance data
is only being reviewed by your manager

00:09:38.242 --> 00:09:40.298
in internal settings,

00:09:40.322 --> 00:09:42.588
it simply isn't motivating enough.

00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:46.061
But if that data is out there,

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:49.506
in the open, for the community to see,

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.663
that's a very different picture.

00:09:52.847 --> 00:09:55.577
That just unlocks a competitive spirit

00:09:55.601 --> 00:09:58.734
which is inherent
in each and every one of us.

00:09:59.727 --> 00:10:02.552
So now, when you put these two together,

00:10:02.576 --> 00:10:06.624
the coffee shop strategy
and public competition,

00:10:06.648 --> 00:10:09.327
you now had a public health system

00:10:09.351 --> 00:10:14.171
which was significantly more motivated
to improve citizen health.

00:10:15.565 --> 00:10:19.090
And now that you had
a more motivated health system,

00:10:19.114 --> 00:10:22.878
it was actually a system
that was now much more ready for support.

00:10:23.228 --> 00:10:25.783
Because now, there is a pull
for the support,

00:10:25.807 --> 00:10:29.714
whether it's resources,
data or skill building.

00:10:30.667 --> 00:10:32.267
Let me share an example.

00:10:32.921 --> 00:10:37.323
I was once at a district meeting
in the district of Ajmer.

00:10:37.347 --> 00:10:40.483
This is one of the districts
that had been rising rapidly

00:10:40.507 --> 00:10:41.657
in the rankings.

00:10:42.346 --> 00:10:44.466
And there were a group
of passionate doctors

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:48.571
who were discussing ideas
on how to better support their teams.

00:10:49.485 --> 00:10:52.921
One of the doctors
had up-skilled health workers

00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:55.678
to tackle the problem of nurse shortages.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.918
Another doctor was using WhatsApp
in creative ways

00:10:59.942 --> 00:11:04.077
to share information and ideas
with his frontline workers.

00:11:04.101 --> 00:11:05.307
For example,

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:09.149
where are the children
who are missing from immunization?

00:11:09.173 --> 00:11:11.062
And how do you convince the mothers

00:11:11.086 --> 00:11:13.798
to actually bring their children
for immunization?

00:11:14.514 --> 00:11:18.355
And because their teams
were now significantly motivated,

00:11:18.379 --> 00:11:20.887
they were simply lapping up the support,

00:11:20.911 --> 00:11:24.244
because they wanted to perform
better and better.

00:11:26.204 --> 00:11:32.156
Broken systems certainly need
more resources and tools.

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:35.418
But they won't drive much impact

00:11:35.442 --> 00:11:38.976
if you don't first address
the motivation challenge.

00:11:39.768 --> 00:11:43.204
Once the motivation tide begins to shift,

00:11:43.228 --> 00:11:48.240
that's when you get the real returns
off resources and tools.

00:11:50.274 --> 00:11:52.635
But I still haven't answered
a key question.

00:11:53.328 --> 00:11:57.178
What happened to the performance
of Rajasthan's public health system?

00:11:58.535 --> 00:12:01.974
In 2016, when our work began,

00:12:01.998 --> 00:12:05.085
the government of India and the World Bank

00:12:05.109 --> 00:12:07.509
came out with a public health index.

00:12:08.371 --> 00:12:13.408
Rajasthan was ranked 20th
out of 21 large states.

00:12:14.353 --> 00:12:16.051
But in 2018,

00:12:16.075 --> 00:12:18.217
when the next ranking came out,

00:12:18.241 --> 00:12:21.045
Rajasthan showed
one of the highest improvements

00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:23.466
among all large states in India,

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.180
leapfrogging four positions.

00:12:26.204 --> 00:12:29.658
For example, it showed
one of the highest reductions

00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:31.942
in neonatal mortality,

00:12:31.966 --> 00:12:36.576
with 3,000 additional newborn lives
being saved every year.

00:12:37.751 --> 00:12:43.552
Typically, public health transformations
take a long time, even decades.

00:12:44.052 --> 00:12:46.847
But this approach had delivered results

00:12:46.871 --> 00:12:48.609
in two years.

00:12:50.387 --> 00:12:52.140
But here's the best part.

00:12:52.164 --> 00:12:56.491
There is actually nothing
Rajasthan-specific about what we learned.

00:12:57.198 --> 00:13:02.484
In fact, this approach
of using the citizen to trigger motivation

00:13:02.508 --> 00:13:05.574
is not even limited
to public health systems.

00:13:06.969 --> 00:13:11.778
I sincerely believe
that if there is any public system,

00:13:11.802 --> 00:13:13.397
in any country,

00:13:13.421 --> 00:13:15.308
that is in inertia,

00:13:15.332 --> 00:13:18.132
then we need to bring back the motivation.

00:13:18.601 --> 00:13:21.744
And a great way to trigger the motivation

00:13:21.768 --> 00:13:25.061
is to increase transparency
to the citizen.

00:13:26.379 --> 00:13:28.291
We can do this with education

00:13:28.315 --> 00:13:31.649
and sanitation and even
political representation.

00:13:32.863 --> 00:13:37.402
Government schools can compete publicly
on the basis of student enrollment.

00:13:38.144 --> 00:13:41.216
Cities and towns,
on the basis of cleanliness.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.906
And politicians on the basis
of a scorecard

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.130
of how exactly they're
improving citizen lives.

00:13:49.117 --> 00:13:52.717
There are many broken systems
out there in the world.

00:13:53.236 --> 00:13:55.836
We need to bring back their motivation.

00:13:56.841 --> 00:13:58.888
The citizen is waiting.

00:13:59.397 --> 00:14:01.556
We must act today.

00:14:02.095 --> 00:14:03.444
Thank you very much.

00:14:03.468 --> 00:14:05.880
