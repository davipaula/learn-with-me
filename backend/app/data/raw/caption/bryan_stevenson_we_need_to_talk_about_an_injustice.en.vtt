00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.141
Well, this is a really
extraordinary honor for me.

00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:23.831
I spend most of my time in jails,
in prisons, on death row.

00:00:23.855 --> 00:00:26.459
I spend most of my time
in very low-income communities,

00:00:26.483 --> 00:00:30.196
in the projects and places where
there's a great deal of hopelessness.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.772
And being here at TED
and seeing the stimulation, hearing it,

00:00:33.796 --> 00:00:35.590
has been very, very energizing to me.

00:00:35.614 --> 00:00:38.527
And one of the things that's emerged
in my short time here

00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:40.545
is that TED has an identity.

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.975
And you can actually say things here
that have impacts around the world.

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:49.841
And sometimes when it comes through TED,
it has meaning and power

00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:52.760
that it doesn't have when it doesn't.

00:00:52.784 --> 00:00:56.053
And I mention that because I think
identity is really important.

00:00:56.077 --> 00:00:58.991
And we've had some
fantastic presentations.

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:02.099
And I think what we've learned
is that, if you're a teacher,

00:01:02.123 --> 00:01:03.522
your words can be meaningful,

00:01:03.546 --> 00:01:07.037
but if you're a compassionate teacher,
they can be especially meaningful.

00:01:07.061 --> 00:01:09.306
If you're a doctor,
you can do some good things,

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.160
but if you're a caring doctor,
you can do some other things.

00:01:12.184 --> 00:01:15.224
So I want to talk about
the power of identity.

00:01:15.248 --> 00:01:18.116
And I didn't learn about this
actually practicing law

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.558
and doing the work that I do.

00:01:19.582 --> 00:01:21.991
I actually learned about this
from my grandmother.

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:26.163
I grew up in a house that was
the traditional African American home

00:01:26.187 --> 00:01:27.815
that was dominated by a matriarch,

00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:30.176
and that matriarch was my grandmother.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.309
She was tough, she was strong,
she was powerful.

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:37.394
She was the end
of every argument in our family.

00:01:37.418 --> 00:01:38.419
(Laughter)

00:01:38.443 --> 00:01:41.384
She was the beginning
of a lot of arguments in our family.

00:01:41.408 --> 00:01:42.409
(Laughter)

00:01:42.433 --> 00:01:45.169
She was the daughter of people
who were actually enslaved.

00:01:45.193 --> 00:01:47.971
Her parents were born in slavery
in Virginia in the 1840s.

00:01:47.995 --> 00:01:49.527
She was born in the 1880s,

00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:50.986
and the experience of slavery

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.333
very much shaped
the way she saw the world.

00:01:53.644 --> 00:01:56.175
And my grandmother was tough,
but she was also loving.

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:57.986
When I would see her as a little boy,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.080
she'd come up to me
and give me these hugs.

00:02:00.104 --> 00:02:02.651
And she'd squeeze me so tight
I could barely breathe,

00:02:02.675 --> 00:02:04.277
and then she'd let me go.

00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:06.207
And an hour or two later, if I saw her,

00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:09.696
she'd come over to me and say,
"Bryan, do you still feel me hugging you?"

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.652
If I said, "No," she'd assault me again,

00:02:11.676 --> 00:02:13.709
and if I said, "Yes,"
she'd leave me alone.

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:17.005
And she just had this quality
that you always wanted to be near her.

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:19.507
And the only challenge
was that she had 10 children.

00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:21.477
My mom was the youngest of her 10 kids.

00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:24.069
And sometimes when I would go
and spend time with her,

00:02:24.093 --> 00:02:26.533
it would be difficult to get
her time and attention.

00:02:26.557 --> 00:02:28.782
My cousins would be
running around everywhere.

00:02:28.806 --> 00:02:31.510
And I remember, when I was
about eight or nine years old,

00:02:31.534 --> 00:02:33.932
waking up one morning,
going into the living room,

00:02:33.956 --> 00:02:36.002
and all of my cousins were running around.

00:02:36.026 --> 00:02:38.229
And my grandmother
was sitting across the room,

00:02:38.253 --> 00:02:39.427
staring at me.

00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:41.677
And at first, I thought
we were playing a game.

00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:44.986
And I would look at her, and I'd smile,
but she was very serious.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.986
And after about 15 or 20 minutes of this,

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.375
she got up and she came across the room,

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:51.319
and she took me by the hand,

00:02:51.343 --> 00:02:54.517
and she said, "Come on, Bryan.
You and I are going to have a talk."

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:57.821
And I remember this
just like it happened yesterday.

00:02:57.845 --> 00:02:59.740
I never will forget it.

00:02:59.764 --> 00:03:03.122
She took me out back and said,
"Bryan, I'm going to tell you something,

00:03:03.146 --> 00:03:05.203
but you don't tell anybody
what I tell you."

00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:06.382
I said, "OK, Mama."

00:03:06.406 --> 00:03:08.721
She said, "Now, you make sure
you don't do that."

00:03:08.745 --> 00:03:09.899
I said, "Sure."

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:12.470
Then she sat me down and she looked at me,

00:03:12.494 --> 00:03:15.744
and she said, "I want you to know
I've been watching you."

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:19.422
And she said, "I think you're special."

00:03:19.928 --> 00:03:24.196
She said, "I think you can do
anything you want to do."

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.841
I will never forget it.

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.899
And then she said, "I just need you
to promise me three things, Bryan."

00:03:29.923 --> 00:03:31.083
I said, "OK, Mama."

00:03:31.107 --> 00:03:33.524
She said, "The first thing
I want you to promise me

00:03:33.548 --> 00:03:35.642
is that you'll always love your mom."

00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:37.147
She said, "That's my baby girl,

00:03:37.171 --> 00:03:40.161
and you have to promise me now
you'll always take care of her."

00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:43.003
Well, I adored my mom,
so I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."

00:03:43.027 --> 00:03:45.759
Then she said, "The second thing
I want you to promise me

00:03:45.783 --> 00:03:47.836
is that you'll always do the right thing,

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.351
even when the right thing
is the hard thing."

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:53.448
And I thought about it, and I said,
"Yes, Mama. I'll do that."

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.136
Then finally, she said, "The third thing
I want you to promise me

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.368
is that you'll never drink alcohol."

00:03:59.392 --> 00:04:00.986
(Laughter)

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.152
Well, I was nine years old,
so I said, "Yes, Mama. I'll do that."

00:04:04.176 --> 00:04:06.264
I grew up in the country
in the rural South,

00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:09.694
and I have a brother a year older than me
and a sister a year younger.

00:04:09.718 --> 00:04:10.967
When I was about 14 or 15,

00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:14.022
one day, my brother came home
and he had this six-pack of beer;

00:04:14.046 --> 00:04:15.453
I don't know where he got it.

00:04:15.477 --> 00:04:18.225
He grabbed me and my sister,
and we went out in the woods,

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:21.003
and we were just out there
doing the stuff we crazily did,

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:23.674
and he had a sip of this beer
and gave some to my sister

00:04:23.698 --> 00:04:25.761
and she had some,
and they offered it to me.

00:04:25.785 --> 00:04:28.946
I said, "No, that's OK. Y'all go ahead.
I'm not going to have any."

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.552
My brother said, "Come on. We're doing
this today; you always do what we do.

00:04:32.576 --> 00:04:34.915
I had some, your sister had some.
Have some beer."

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:37.761
I said, "No, I don't feel right
about that. Y'all go ahead."

00:04:37.785 --> 00:04:41.695
And then my brother stared at me and said,
"What's wrong with you? Have some beer."

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:43.641
Then he looked at me real hard and said,

00:04:43.665 --> 00:04:47.308
"Oh, I hope you're not still hung up on
that conversation Mama had with you."

00:04:47.332 --> 00:04:48.334
(Laughter)

00:04:48.358 --> 00:04:50.139
I said, "What are you talking about?"

00:04:50.163 --> 00:04:53.316
He said, "Oh, Mama tells
all the grandkids that they're special."

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.462
(Laughter)

00:04:55.486 --> 00:04:57.986
I was devastated.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.898
(Laughter)

00:05:00.416 --> 00:05:02.355
And I'm going to admit something to you.

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:04.922
I'm going to tell you something
I probably shouldn't.

00:05:04.946 --> 00:05:06.826
I know this might be broadcast broadly.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.028
But I'm 52 years old,

00:05:08.052 --> 00:05:09.491
and I'm going to admit to you

00:05:09.515 --> 00:05:12.575
that I've never had a drop of alcohol.

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.700
(Applause)

00:05:14.724 --> 00:05:17.368
I don't say that because
I think that's virtuous;

00:05:17.392 --> 00:05:21.010
I say that because
there is power in identity.

00:05:21.557 --> 00:05:23.622
When we create the right kind of identity,

00:05:23.646 --> 00:05:25.599
we can say things to the world around us

00:05:25.623 --> 00:05:28.153
that they don't actually
believe make sense.

00:05:28.177 --> 00:05:31.922
We can get them to do things
that they don't think they can do.

00:05:32.359 --> 00:05:34.110
When I thought about my grandmother,

00:05:34.134 --> 00:05:36.868
of course she would think
all her grandkids were special.

00:05:36.892 --> 00:05:39.212
My grandfather was in prison
during prohibition.

00:05:39.236 --> 00:05:41.542
My male uncles died
of alcohol-related diseases.

00:05:41.566 --> 00:05:44.445
And these were the things
she thought we needed to commit to.

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:48.057
Well, I've been trying to say something
about our criminal justice system.

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:51.636
This country is very different today
than it was 40 years ago.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.148
In 1972, there were 300,000 people
in jails and prisons.

00:05:55.172 --> 00:05:58.924
Today, there are 2.3 million.

00:05:59.898 --> 00:06:02.709
The United States now has
the highest rate of incarceration

00:06:02.733 --> 00:06:03.919
in the world.

00:06:03.943 --> 00:06:06.697
We have seven million people
on probation and parole.

00:06:06.721 --> 00:06:09.544
And mass incarceration, in my judgment,

00:06:09.568 --> 00:06:12.277
has fundamentally changed our world.

00:06:13.444 --> 00:06:15.643
In poor communities,
in communities of color,

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:16.986
there is this despair,

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:18.853
there is this hopelessness

00:06:18.877 --> 00:06:20.985
that is being shaped by these outcomes.

00:06:21.383 --> 00:06:24.515
One out of three Black men
between the ages of 18 and 30

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:27.986
is in jail, in prison,
on probation or parole.

00:06:28.714 --> 00:06:30.729
In urban communities
across this country --

00:06:30.753 --> 00:06:33.207
Los Angeles, Philadelphia,
Baltimore, Washington --

00:06:33.231 --> 00:06:36.081
50 to 60 percent of all young men of color

00:06:36.105 --> 00:06:37.415
are in jail or prison

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:39.231
or on probation or parole.

00:06:39.255 --> 00:06:41.581
Our system isn't just
being shaped in these ways

00:06:41.605 --> 00:06:43.645
that seem to be distorting around race,

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.311
they're also distorted by poverty.

00:06:45.335 --> 00:06:47.986
We have a system of justice
in this country

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.936
that treats you much better
if you're rich and guilty

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.533
than if you're poor and innocent.

00:06:53.557 --> 00:06:57.160
Wealth, not culpability, shapes outcomes.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.051
And yet, we seem to be very comfortable.

00:07:01.726 --> 00:07:04.657
The politics of fear and anger
have made us believe

00:07:04.681 --> 00:07:07.168
that these are problems
that are not our problems.

00:07:07.668 --> 00:07:09.315
We've been disconnected.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.435
It's interesting to me.

00:07:11.459 --> 00:07:14.484
We're looking at some very interesting
developments in our work.

00:07:14.508 --> 00:07:16.624
My state of Alabama,
like a number of states,

00:07:16.648 --> 00:07:20.192
actually permanently disenfranchises you
if you have a criminal conviction.

00:07:20.216 --> 00:07:21.380
Right now in Alabama,

00:07:21.404 --> 00:07:26.668
34 percent of the Black male population
has permanently lost the right to vote.

00:07:26.692 --> 00:07:29.107
We're actually projecting
that in another 10 years,

00:07:29.131 --> 00:07:31.966
the level of disenfranchisement
will be as high as it's been

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.448
since prior to the passage
of the Voting Rights Act.

00:07:34.472 --> 00:07:36.988
And there is this stunning silence.

00:07:38.384 --> 00:07:40.114
I represent children.

00:07:40.138 --> 00:07:41.837
A lot of my clients are very young.

00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:44.202
The United States
is the only country in the world

00:07:44.226 --> 00:07:46.124
where we sentence 13-year-old children

00:07:46.148 --> 00:07:47.448
to die in prison.

00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:51.269
We have life imprisonment without parole
for kids in this country.

00:07:51.293 --> 00:07:53.370
And we're actually doing some litigation.

00:07:53.394 --> 00:07:54.924
The only country in the world.

00:07:55.369 --> 00:07:56.933
I represent people on death row.

00:07:56.957 --> 00:07:59.769
It's interesting, this question
of the death penalty.

00:07:59.793 --> 00:08:03.088
In many ways, we've been taught to think
that the real question is:

00:08:03.112 --> 00:08:05.874
Do people deserve to die
for the crimes they've committed?

00:08:05.898 --> 00:08:07.984
And that's a very sensible question.

00:08:08.388 --> 00:08:12.118
But there's another way of thinking
about where we are in our identity.

00:08:12.142 --> 00:08:14.159
The other way of thinking about it is not:

00:08:14.183 --> 00:08:16.679
Do people deserve to die
for the crimes they commit?,

00:08:16.703 --> 00:08:18.565
but: Do we deserve to kill?

00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:20.247
I mean, it's fascinating.

00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:22.779
Death penalty in America
is defined by error.

00:08:22.803 --> 00:08:24.947
For every nine people
who have been executed,

00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:27.169
we've actually identified
one innocent person

00:08:27.193 --> 00:08:30.127
who's been exonerated
and released from death row.

00:08:30.754 --> 00:08:33.065
A kind of astonishing error rate --

00:08:33.089 --> 00:08:35.545
one out of nine people, innocent.

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:37.986
I mean, it's fascinating.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.667
In aviation, we would never
let people fly on airplanes

00:08:40.691 --> 00:08:42.668
if, for every nine planes that took off,

00:08:42.692 --> 00:08:43.842
one would crash.

00:08:43.866 --> 00:08:44.867
(Laughter)

00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:48.212
But somehow, we can insulate ourselves
from this problem.

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:49.837
It's not our problem.

00:08:49.861 --> 00:08:51.214
It's not our burden.

00:08:51.238 --> 00:08:52.833
It's not our struggle.

00:08:53.732 --> 00:08:55.308
I talk a lot about these issues.

00:08:55.332 --> 00:08:57.349
I talk about race

00:08:57.373 --> 00:08:59.646
and this question
of whether we deserve to kill.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:00.821
And it's interesting,

00:09:00.845 --> 00:09:03.499
when I teach my students
about African American history,

00:09:03.523 --> 00:09:04.790
I tell them about slavery.

00:09:04.814 --> 00:09:06.155
I tell them about terrorism,

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:08.423
the era that began
at the end of reconstruction

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:09.872
that went on to World War II.

00:09:09.896 --> 00:09:11.819
We don't really know very much about it.

00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:13.902
But for African Americans in this country,

00:09:13.926 --> 00:09:16.159
that was an era defined by terror.

00:09:16.183 --> 00:09:19.057
In many communities,
people had to worry about being lynched.

00:09:19.081 --> 00:09:20.882
They had to worry about being bombed.

00:09:20.906 --> 00:09:23.375
It was the threat of terror
that shaped their lives.

00:09:23.399 --> 00:09:25.699
And these older people
come up to me now and say,

00:09:25.723 --> 00:09:28.084
"Mr. Stevenson, you give talks,
you make speeches,

00:09:28.108 --> 00:09:30.981
you tell people to stop saying
we're dealing with terrorism

00:09:31.005 --> 00:09:33.888
for the first time
in our nation's history after 9/11."

00:09:33.912 --> 00:09:37.001
They tell me to say, "No, tell
them that we grew up with that."

00:09:37.025 --> 00:09:41.364
And that era of terrorism, of course,
was followed by segregation

00:09:41.388 --> 00:09:43.159
and decades of racial subordination

00:09:43.183 --> 00:09:44.953
and apartheid.

00:09:45.555 --> 00:09:47.120
And yet, we have in this country

00:09:47.144 --> 00:09:51.179
this dynamic where we really don't like
to talk about our problems.

00:09:51.203 --> 00:09:53.689
We don't like to talk about our history.

00:09:53.713 --> 00:09:56.690
And because of that,
we really haven't understood

00:09:56.714 --> 00:09:59.690
what it's meant to do the things
we've done historically.

00:10:00.069 --> 00:10:02.097
We're constantly running into each other.

00:10:02.121 --> 00:10:04.434
We're constantly creating
tensions and conflicts.

00:10:04.458 --> 00:10:07.321
We have a hard time talking about race,

00:10:07.345 --> 00:10:10.626
and I believe it's because we are
unwilling to commit ourselves

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.723
to a process of truth and reconciliation.

00:10:12.747 --> 00:10:14.734
In South Africa,

00:10:14.758 --> 00:10:17.359
people understood
that we couldn't overcome apartheid

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:19.696
without a commitment
to truth and reconciliation.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.695
In Rwanda, even after the genocide,
there was this commitment.

00:10:22.719 --> 00:10:24.727
But in this country, we haven't done that.

00:10:24.751 --> 00:10:27.885
I was giving some lectures in Germany
about the death penalty.

00:10:27.909 --> 00:10:29.098
It was fascinating,

00:10:29.122 --> 00:10:31.986
because one of the scholars
stood up after the presentation

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.289
and said, "Well, you know,
it's deeply troubling

00:10:34.313 --> 00:10:36.232
to hear what you're talking about."

00:10:36.256 --> 00:10:38.819
He said, "We don't have
the death penalty in Germany,

00:10:38.843 --> 00:10:42.374
and of course, we can never
have the death penalty in Germany."

00:10:42.398 --> 00:10:43.756
And the room got very quiet,

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.685
and this woman said,

00:10:45.709 --> 00:10:48.986
"There's no way, with our history,

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:53.095
we could ever engage
in the systematic killing of human beings.

00:10:53.484 --> 00:10:56.047
It would be unconscionable for us

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.986
to, in an intentional and deliberate way,

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.133
set about executing people."

00:11:02.077 --> 00:11:03.444
And I thought about that.

00:11:04.222 --> 00:11:06.839
What would it feel like
to be living in a world

00:11:07.954 --> 00:11:10.540
where the nation-state of Germany
was executing people,

00:11:10.564 --> 00:11:12.993
especially if they were
disproportionately Jewish?

00:11:13.017 --> 00:11:14.212
I couldn't bear it.

00:11:14.724 --> 00:11:16.922
It would be unconscionable.

00:11:16.946 --> 00:11:19.026
And yet, in this country,

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:21.217
in the states of the Old South,

00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:22.986
we execute people --

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.803
where you're 11 times more likely
to get the death penalty

00:11:25.827 --> 00:11:28.241
if the victim is white
than if the victim is Black,

00:11:28.265 --> 00:11:29.701
22 times more likely to get it

00:11:29.725 --> 00:11:32.165
if the defendant is Black
and the victim is white --

00:11:32.189 --> 00:11:34.909
in the very states where there are,
buried in the ground,

00:11:34.933 --> 00:11:36.757
the bodies of people who were lynched.

00:11:36.781 --> 00:11:38.534
And yet, there is this disconnect.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.140
Well, I believe
that our identity is at risk,

00:11:43.339 --> 00:11:48.196
that when we actually don't care
about these difficult things,

00:11:49.363 --> 00:11:52.773
the positive and wonderful things
are nonetheless implicated.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:55.907
We love innovation.

00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:58.546
We love technology. We love creativity.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.546
We love entertainment.

00:12:01.696 --> 00:12:02.986
But ultimately,

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:07.799
those realities are shadowed by suffering,

00:12:07.823 --> 00:12:10.668
abuse, degradation,

00:12:10.692 --> 00:12:11.986
marginalization.

00:12:12.625 --> 00:12:16.424
And for me, it becomes necessary
to integrate the two,

00:12:16.448 --> 00:12:20.589
because ultimately, we are talking about
a need to be more hopeful,

00:12:20.613 --> 00:12:22.791
more committed, more dedicated

00:12:22.815 --> 00:12:26.139
to the basic challenges
of living in a complex world.

00:12:26.163 --> 00:12:29.335
And for me, that means

00:12:29.359 --> 00:12:33.438
spending time thinking and talking
about the poor, the disadvantaged,

00:12:33.462 --> 00:12:35.690
those who will never get to TED,

00:12:36.222 --> 00:12:39.986
but thinking about them in a way
that is integrated in our own lives.

00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:43.827
You know, ultimately, we all
have to believe things we haven't seen.

00:12:43.851 --> 00:12:45.039
We do.

00:12:45.063 --> 00:12:47.884
As rational as we are,
as committed to intellect as we are,

00:12:47.908 --> 00:12:50.845
innovation, creativity, development

00:12:50.869 --> 00:12:54.256
comes not from the ideas
in our mind alone.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.706
They come from the ideas in our mind

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.930
that are also fueled
by some conviction in our heart.

00:13:00.526 --> 00:13:05.154
And it's that mind-heart connection
that I believe compels us

00:13:05.178 --> 00:13:09.986
to not just be attentive
to all the bright and dazzly things,

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:12.509
but also the dark and difficult things.

00:13:13.248 --> 00:13:15.892
Václav Havel, the great Czech leader,
talked about this.

00:13:15.916 --> 00:13:19.221
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe
and dealing with oppression,

00:13:19.245 --> 00:13:20.711
we wanted all kinds of things.

00:13:20.735 --> 00:13:22.798
But mostly what we needed was hope,

00:13:22.822 --> 00:13:24.681
an orientation of the spirit,

00:13:24.705 --> 00:13:26.992
a willingness to sometimes
be in hopeless places

00:13:27.016 --> 00:13:28.256
and be a witness."

00:13:28.748 --> 00:13:33.986
Well, that orientation of the spirit
is very much at the core of what I believe

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:37.879
even TED communities
have to be engaged in.

00:13:38.355 --> 00:13:42.519
There is no disconnect
around technology and design

00:13:42.543 --> 00:13:45.233
that will allow us to be fully human

00:13:45.257 --> 00:13:47.472
until we pay attention to suffering,

00:13:47.496 --> 00:13:51.102
to poverty, to exclusion,
to unfairness, to injustice.

00:13:51.126 --> 00:13:52.712
Now, I will warn you

00:13:52.736 --> 00:13:57.739
that this kind of identity
is a much more challenging identity

00:13:57.763 --> 00:13:59.908
than ones that don't
pay attention to this.

00:14:00.686 --> 00:14:01.850
It will get to you.

00:14:01.874 --> 00:14:04.370
I had the great privilege,
when I was a young lawyer,

00:14:04.394 --> 00:14:05.565
of meeting Rosa Parks.

00:14:05.589 --> 00:14:08.675
And Ms. Parks used to come back
to Montgomery every now and then,

00:14:08.699 --> 00:14:11.509
and she would get together
with two of her dearest friends,

00:14:11.533 --> 00:14:12.693
these older women,

00:14:12.717 --> 00:14:15.986
Johnnie Carr, who was the organizer
of the Montgomery bus boycott --

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:17.880
amazing African American woman --

00:14:17.904 --> 00:14:19.563
and Virginia Durr, a white woman,

00:14:19.587 --> 00:14:22.273
whose husband, Clifford Durr,
represented Dr. King.

00:14:22.297 --> 00:14:24.642
And these women
would get together and just talk.

00:14:24.666 --> 00:14:26.826
And every now and then
Ms. Carr would call me,

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.247
and she'd say, "Bryan,
Ms. Parks is coming to town.

00:14:29.271 --> 00:14:32.824
We're going to get together and talk.
Do you want to come over and listen?"

00:14:32.848 --> 00:14:34.385
And I'd say, "Yes, ma'am, I do."

00:14:34.409 --> 00:14:37.050
She'd say, "What are you going to do
when you get here?"

00:14:37.074 --> 00:14:38.513
I said, "I'm going to listen."

00:14:38.537 --> 00:14:40.943
And I'd go over there
and I would, I'd just listen.

00:14:40.967 --> 00:14:43.042
It would be so energizing
and so empowering.

00:14:43.066 --> 00:14:45.879
And one time I was over there
listening to these women talk,

00:14:45.903 --> 00:14:48.770
and after a couple of hours,
Ms. Parks turned to me and said,

00:14:48.794 --> 00:14:51.282
"Bryan, tell me what
the Equal Justice Initiative is.

00:14:51.306 --> 00:14:52.930
Tell me what you're trying to do."

00:14:52.954 --> 00:14:54.392
And I began giving her my rap.

00:14:54.416 --> 00:14:56.195
"We're trying to challenge injustice.

00:14:56.219 --> 00:14:59.067
We're trying to help people
who have been wrongly convicted.

00:14:59.091 --> 00:15:01.332
We're trying to confront
bias and discrimination

00:15:01.356 --> 00:15:03.380
in the administration of criminal justice.

00:15:03.404 --> 00:15:06.381
We're trying to end life without parole
sentences for children.

00:15:06.405 --> 00:15:08.889
We're trying to do something
about the death penalty.

00:15:08.913 --> 00:15:11.025
We're trying to reduce
the prison population.

00:15:11.049 --> 00:15:12.970
We're trying to end mass incarceration."

00:15:12.994 --> 00:15:15.900
I gave her my whole rap,
and when I finished she looked at me

00:15:15.924 --> 00:15:17.245
and she said, "Mmm mmm mmm.

00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:19.427
That's going to make
you tired, tired, tired."

00:15:19.451 --> 00:15:20.685
(Laughter)

00:15:20.709 --> 00:15:24.079
And that's when Ms. Carr leaned forward,
she put her finger in my face,

00:15:24.103 --> 00:15:28.152
she said, "That's why you've got to be
brave, brave, brave."

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.345
And I actually believe
that the TED community

00:15:31.369 --> 00:15:33.694
needs to be more courageous.

00:15:34.551 --> 00:15:38.039
We need to find ways
to embrace these challenges,

00:15:38.063 --> 00:15:40.374
these problems, the suffering.

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:44.728
Because ultimately, our humanity
depends on everyone's humanity.

00:15:44.752 --> 00:15:47.465
I've learned very simple things
doing the work that I do.

00:15:47.489 --> 00:15:49.406
It's just taught me very simple things.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.986
I've come to understand and to believe

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:55.894
that each of us is more
than the worst thing we've ever done.

00:15:55.918 --> 00:15:58.975
I believe that
for every person on the planet.

00:15:59.355 --> 00:16:02.556
I think if somebody tells a lie,
they're not just a liar.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.594
I think if somebody takes something
that doesn't belong to them,

00:16:05.618 --> 00:16:06.828
they're not just a thief.

00:16:06.852 --> 00:16:09.641
I think even if you kill someone,
you're not just a killer.

00:16:09.665 --> 00:16:12.187
And because of that,
there's this basic human dignity

00:16:12.211 --> 00:16:13.970
that must be respected by law.

00:16:14.484 --> 00:16:16.183
I also believe

00:16:16.207 --> 00:16:18.128
that in many parts of this country,

00:16:18.152 --> 00:16:20.688
and certainly in many parts of this globe,

00:16:21.705 --> 00:16:24.228
that the opposite of poverty
is not wealth.

00:16:25.013 --> 00:16:26.324
I don't believe that.

00:16:26.348 --> 00:16:28.986
I actually think, in too many places,

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:31.658
the opposite of poverty is justice.

00:16:32.357 --> 00:16:34.129
And finally, I believe

00:16:35.262 --> 00:16:38.973
that, despite the fact that it is
so dramatic and so beautiful

00:16:38.997 --> 00:16:41.543
and so inspiring and so stimulating,

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:45.643
we will ultimately not be judged
by our technology,

00:16:45.667 --> 00:16:47.921
we won't be judged by our design,

00:16:47.945 --> 00:16:50.294
we won't be judged
by our intellect and reason.

00:16:50.318 --> 00:16:53.890
Ultimately, you judge
the character of a society

00:16:53.914 --> 00:16:57.179
not by how they treat their rich
and the powerful and the privileged,

00:16:57.203 --> 00:16:58.925
but by how they treat the poor,

00:16:58.949 --> 00:17:00.286
the condemned,

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.581
the incarcerated.

00:17:01.605 --> 00:17:02.986
Because it's in that nexus

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.256
that we actually begin to understand
truly profound things

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.930
about who we are.

00:17:09.795 --> 00:17:11.296
I sometimes get out of balance.

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.532
I'll end with this story.

00:17:12.556 --> 00:17:13.938
I sometimes push too hard.

00:17:13.962 --> 00:17:15.986
I do get tired, as we all do.

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.241
Sometimes those ideas
get ahead of our thinking

00:17:19.265 --> 00:17:20.702
in ways that are important.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.070
And I've been representing these kids

00:17:23.094 --> 00:17:25.650
who have been sentenced
to these very harsh sentences.

00:17:25.674 --> 00:17:28.533
And I go to the jail and I see
my client, who's 13 and 14,

00:17:28.557 --> 00:17:30.946
and he's been certified
to stand trial as an adult.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.044
I start thinking, well,
how did that happen?

00:17:33.068 --> 00:17:36.135
How can a judge turn you
into something that you're not?

00:17:36.658 --> 00:17:39.673
And the judge has certified him
as an adult, but I see this kid.

00:17:39.697 --> 00:17:42.288
And I was up too late one night
and I started thinking,

00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:45.063
well, if the judge can turn you
into something you're not,

00:17:45.087 --> 00:17:46.646
the judge must have magic power.

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.739
Yeah, Bryan, the judge
has some magic power.

00:17:48.763 --> 00:17:50.501
You should ask for some of that.

00:17:50.525 --> 00:17:53.540
And because I was up too late
and wasn't thinking real straight,

00:17:53.564 --> 00:17:55.038
I started working on a motion.

00:17:55.062 --> 00:17:58.243
I had a client who was 14 years old,
a young, poor Black kid.

00:17:58.267 --> 00:18:01.536
And I started working on this motion,
and the head of the motion was:

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.083
"Motion to try my poor,
14-year-old Black male client

00:18:04.107 --> 00:18:07.459
like a privileged, white,
75-year-old corporate executive."

00:18:07.483 --> 00:18:08.586
(Laughter)

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:13.083
(Applause and cheers)

00:18:13.107 --> 00:18:16.040
And I put in my motion
that there was prosecutorial misconduct

00:18:16.064 --> 00:18:18.239
and police misconduct
and judicial misconduct.

00:18:18.263 --> 00:18:19.757
There was a crazy line in there

00:18:19.781 --> 00:18:22.850
about how there's no conduct
in this county, it's all misconduct.

00:18:22.874 --> 00:18:25.044
And the next morning,
I woke up and I thought,

00:18:25.068 --> 00:18:28.037
now, did I dream that crazy motion,
or did I actually write it?

00:18:28.061 --> 00:18:30.126
And to my horror,
not only had I written it,

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.482
but I had sent it to court.

00:18:31.506 --> 00:18:33.795
(Applause)

00:18:34.303 --> 00:18:36.517
A couple months went by,

00:18:36.541 --> 00:18:39.041
and I just had forgotten all about it.

00:18:39.065 --> 00:18:40.986
And I finally decided,

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:43.868
"Gosh, I've got to go to the court
and do this crazy case."

00:18:43.892 --> 00:18:47.334
And I got in my car, and I was feeling
really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed.

00:18:47.358 --> 00:18:49.624
And I got in my car
and went to this courthouse.

00:18:49.648 --> 00:18:52.721
And I was thinking, this is going
to be so difficult, so painful.

00:18:52.745 --> 00:18:56.273
And I finally got out of the car
and started walking up to the courthouse.

00:18:56.297 --> 00:18:57.965
And as I was walking up the steps,

00:18:57.989 --> 00:19:01.181
there was an older Black man
who was the janitor in this courthouse.

00:19:01.205 --> 00:19:04.111
When this man saw me, he came over
and said, "Who are you?"

00:19:04.135 --> 00:19:07.487
I said, "I'm a lawyer." He said,
"You're a lawyer?" I said, "Yes, sir."

00:19:07.511 --> 00:19:09.875
And this man came over to me,
and he hugged me.

00:19:10.711 --> 00:19:12.229
And he whispered in my ear.

00:19:12.253 --> 00:19:14.551
He said, "I'm so proud of you."

00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:17.904
And I have to tell you, it was energizing.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.112
It connected deeply with something in me

00:19:21.136 --> 00:19:22.624
about identity,

00:19:22.648 --> 00:19:26.623
about the capacity of every person
to contribute to community,

00:19:26.647 --> 00:19:28.446
to a perspective that is hopeful.

00:19:28.922 --> 00:19:30.480
Well, I went into the courtroom.

00:19:30.504 --> 00:19:32.953
And as soon as I walked in,
the judge saw me coming.

00:19:32.977 --> 00:19:35.713
He said, "Mr. Stevenson,
did you write this crazy motion?"

00:19:35.737 --> 00:19:38.143
I said, "Yes, sir. I did."
And we started arguing.

00:19:38.167 --> 00:19:39.572
And people started coming in,

00:19:39.596 --> 00:19:41.770
just outraged
I'd written these crazy things.

00:19:41.794 --> 00:19:43.426
And police officers were coming in

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.520
and assistant prosecutors
and clerk workers.

00:19:45.544 --> 00:19:48.085
Before I knew it,
the courtroom was filled with people

00:19:48.109 --> 00:19:49.923
angry that we were talking about race,

00:19:49.947 --> 00:19:53.178
that we were talking about poverty,
talking about inequality.

00:19:53.202 --> 00:19:57.045
And out of the corner of my eye, I could
see this janitor pacing back and forth.

00:19:57.069 --> 00:20:00.131
He kept looking through the window
and could hear all the holler.

00:20:00.155 --> 00:20:03.464
And finally, this older Black man
with a very worried look on his face

00:20:03.488 --> 00:20:06.964
came into the courtroom and sat behind me,
almost at counsel table.

00:20:07.947 --> 00:20:10.388
Ten minutes later,
the judge said we'd take a break.

00:20:10.412 --> 00:20:13.279
During the break, there was
a deputy sheriff who was offended

00:20:13.303 --> 00:20:15.070
that the janitor had come into court.

00:20:15.094 --> 00:20:17.815
The deputy jumped up
and ran over to this older Black man.

00:20:17.839 --> 00:20:20.443
He said, "Jimmy, what are you doing
in this courtroom?"

00:20:20.467 --> 00:20:23.236
And this older Black man stood up
and looked at that deputy

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.740
and he looked at me,

00:20:24.764 --> 00:20:28.986
and he said, "I came into this courtroom
to tell this young man,

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.845
'Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on.'"

00:20:32.459 --> 00:20:33.610
I've come to TED

00:20:33.634 --> 00:20:36.541
because I believe
that many of you understand

00:20:36.565 --> 00:20:38.590
that the moral arc
of the universe is long,

00:20:38.614 --> 00:20:40.454
but it bends toward justice;

00:20:40.478 --> 00:20:42.986
that we cannot be
full, evolved human beings

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.801
until we care about human rights
and basic dignity;

00:20:45.825 --> 00:20:49.851
that all of our survival
is tied to the survival of everyone;

00:20:49.875 --> 00:20:52.385
that our visions of technology and design

00:20:52.409 --> 00:20:53.986
and entertainment and creativity

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:59.391
have to be married with visions
of humanity, compassion and justice.

00:20:59.415 --> 00:21:02.592
And more than anything,
for those of you who share that,

00:21:02.616 --> 00:21:04.715
I've simply come to tell you

00:21:04.739 --> 00:21:07.331
to keep your eyes on the prize, hold on.

00:21:07.355 --> 00:21:08.552
Thank you very much.

00:21:08.576 --> 00:21:15.576
(Applause and cheers)

00:21:28.794 --> 00:21:31.589
Chris Anderson: Brian,
so you heard and saw

00:21:31.613 --> 00:21:34.591
an obvious desire
by this audience, this community,

00:21:34.615 --> 00:21:37.787
to help you on your way
and to do something on this issue.

00:21:37.811 --> 00:21:40.129
Other than writing a check,

00:21:40.153 --> 00:21:42.656
what could we do?

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.931
BS: Well, there are
opportunities all around us.

00:21:44.955 --> 00:21:47.441
If you live in the state
of California, for example,

00:21:47.465 --> 00:21:49.485
there's a referendum coming up this spring

00:21:49.509 --> 00:21:53.005
where there's going to be an effort
to redirect some of the money we spend

00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:54.493
on the politics of punishment.

00:21:54.517 --> 00:21:56.057
For example, here in California,

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:58.301
we're going to spend one billion dollars

00:21:58.325 --> 00:22:00.480
on the death penalty
in the next five years --

00:22:00.504 --> 00:22:02.470
one billion dollars.

00:22:02.494 --> 00:22:06.851
And yet, 46 percent of all homicide cases
don't result in arrest,

00:22:06.875 --> 00:22:08.986
56 percent of all rape cases don't result.

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.986
So there's an opportunity to change that.

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:12.595
And this referendum would propose

00:22:12.619 --> 00:22:16.085
having those dollars go to
law enforcement and safety.

00:22:16.109 --> 00:22:18.451
And I think that opportunity
exists all around us.

00:22:18.475 --> 00:22:22.066
CA: There's been this huge decline
in crime in America

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:23.426
over the last three decades.

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:25.430
And part of the narrative of that

00:22:25.454 --> 00:22:29.491
is sometimes that it's about increased
incarceration rates.

00:22:29.515 --> 00:22:31.759
What would you say to someone
who believed that?

00:22:31.783 --> 00:22:35.270
BS: Well, actually, the violent crime rate
has remained relatively stable.

00:22:35.294 --> 00:22:37.944
The great increase
in mass incarceration in this country

00:22:37.968 --> 00:22:40.004
wasn't really in violent crime categories.

00:22:40.028 --> 00:22:41.791
It was this misguided war on drugs.

00:22:41.815 --> 00:22:43.927
That's where the dramatic
increases have come

00:22:43.951 --> 00:22:45.375
in our prison population.

00:22:45.399 --> 00:22:46.899
(Applause)

00:22:46.923 --> 00:22:49.900
And we got carried away
with the rhetoric of punishment.

00:22:49.924 --> 00:22:51.606
And so we have "Three Strikes" laws

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:53.607
that put people in prison forever

00:22:53.631 --> 00:22:56.177
for stealing a bicycle,
for low-level property crimes,

00:22:56.201 --> 00:22:58.669
rather than making them
give those resources back

00:22:58.693 --> 00:23:00.418
to the people who they victimized.

00:23:00.442 --> 00:23:01.841
I believe we need to do more

00:23:01.865 --> 00:23:03.869
to help people
who are victimized by crime,

00:23:03.893 --> 00:23:05.044
not do less.

00:23:05.068 --> 00:23:07.393
And I think our current
punishment philosophy

00:23:07.417 --> 00:23:08.765
does nothing for no one.

00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:11.610
And I think that's the orientation
that we have to change.

00:23:11.634 --> 00:23:13.140
(Applause)

00:23:13.164 --> 00:23:16.121
CA: Bryan, you've struck
a massive chord here.

00:23:16.145 --> 00:23:17.566
You're an inspiring person.

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:19.800
Thank you so much
for coming to TED. Thank you.

00:23:19.824 --> 00:23:26.824
(Applause and cheers)

00:23:29.783 --> 00:23:31.522
BS: Thank you. Thank you.

00:23:31.546 --> 00:23:35.220
(Applause and cheers)
