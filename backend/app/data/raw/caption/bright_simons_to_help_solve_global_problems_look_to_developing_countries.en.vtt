00:00:13.451 --> 00:00:16.553
I am an ideas activist.

00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:22.422
That means I fight
for ideas I believe in

00:00:23.406 --> 00:00:25.748
to have their place in the sun,

00:00:25.772 --> 00:00:30.304
regardless of which side
of the equator they were born.

00:00:30.946 --> 00:00:32.345
As well I should.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.809
I myself am from that part of the world

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:38.881
often euphemistically referred to
as either "the Global South"

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:40.316
or "the developing world."

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.269
But let's be blunt about it:

00:00:42.293 --> 00:00:46.040
when we say those words,
what we really mean is the poor world --

00:00:46.064 --> 00:00:49.987
those corners of the world
with ready-made containers

00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:54.268
for the hand-me-down ideas
of other places and other people.

00:00:57.026 --> 00:01:00.884
But I'm here to depart
a little bit from the script

00:01:00.908 --> 00:01:03.158
and to try and convince you

00:01:03.182 --> 00:01:06.395
that these places are actually
alive and bubbling with ideas.

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:09.639
My real issue is: Where do I even start?

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:14.467
So maybe Egypt, Alexandria,

00:01:15.147 --> 00:01:16.503
where we meet Rizwan.

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:18.807
When he walks outside his souk,

00:01:18.831 --> 00:01:21.982
walks into a pharmacy for heart medicine

00:01:22.006 --> 00:01:25.195
that can prevent the blood
in his arteries from clotting,

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:26.610
he confronts the fact that,

00:01:28.508 --> 00:01:32.023
despite a growing epidemic

00:01:32.047 --> 00:01:37.787
that currently accounts for 82 percent
of all deaths in Egypt,

00:01:37.811 --> 00:01:41.236
it is the medicines that
can address these conditions

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.535
that counterfeiters,
ever the evil geniuses they are,

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:46.088
have decided to target.

00:01:47.413 --> 00:01:50.312
Counterfeiters making knockoff medicines.

00:01:52.073 --> 00:01:54.134
Luckily for Rizwan,

00:01:54.158 --> 00:01:55.697
my team and I,

00:01:55.721 --> 00:02:00.629
working in partnership with the largest
pharmaceutical company in Africa,

00:02:01.883 --> 00:02:06.920
have placed unique codes --
think of them like one-time passwords --

00:02:06.944 --> 00:02:11.793
on each pack of the best-selling
heart medicine in Egypt.

00:02:12.421 --> 00:02:16.551
So when Rizwan buys heart medicine,

00:02:16.575 --> 00:02:19.845
he can key in these one-time passwords

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:21.741
to a toll-free short code

00:02:21.765 --> 00:02:26.720
that we've set up on all
the telecom companies in Egypt

00:02:26.744 --> 00:02:28.239
for free.

00:02:28.263 --> 00:02:31.103
He gets a message --
call it the message of life --

00:02:31.913 --> 00:02:34.059
which reassures him

00:02:34.083 --> 00:02:39.373
that this medicine is not one of the 12
percent of all medicines in Egypt

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.917
that are counterfeits.

00:02:43.338 --> 00:02:45.899
From the gorgeous banks of the Nile,

00:02:45.923 --> 00:02:50.902
we glide into the beautiful
Rift Valley of Kenya.

00:02:50.926 --> 00:02:54.884
In Narok Town, we meet Ole Lenku,
salt-of-the-earth fellow.

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:56.824
When he walks into an agrodealer's shop,

00:02:56.848 --> 00:03:00.530
all he wants is certified
and proper cabbage seeds

00:03:00.554 --> 00:03:02.243
that, if he were to plant them,

00:03:02.267 --> 00:03:04.667
will yield a harvest rich enough

00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:07.446
that he can pay for
the school fees of his children.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.681
That's all he wants.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.712
Unfortunately,

00:03:10.736 --> 00:03:13.635
by the reckoning of most
international organizations,

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:18.677
40 percent of all the seeds
sold in Eastern and Southern Africa

00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:20.176
are of questionable quality,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.796
sometimes outrightly fake.

00:03:22.836 --> 00:03:24.324
Luckily for Ole,

00:03:24.348 --> 00:03:27.685
once again, our team has been at work,

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.141
and, working with the leading
agriculture regulator in Kenya,

00:03:32.165 --> 00:03:35.570
we've digitized the entire
certification process

00:03:35.594 --> 00:03:37.072
for seeds in that country,

00:03:37.096 --> 00:03:41.085
every seed -- millet, sorghum, maize --

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:47.693
such that when Ole Lenku
keys in a code on a packet of millet,

00:03:47.717 --> 00:03:52.594
he's able to retrieve
a digital certificate

00:03:52.618 --> 00:03:56.482
that assures him that the seed
is properly certified.

00:03:57.175 --> 00:04:00.445
From Kenya, we head to Noida in India,

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:02.641
where the irrepressible Ambika

00:04:02.665 --> 00:04:07.728
is holding on very fast to her dream
of becoming an elite athlete,

00:04:07.752 --> 00:04:09.661
safe in the knowledge that

00:04:09.685 --> 00:04:12.214
because of our ingredients
rating technology,

00:04:12.238 --> 00:04:14.923
she's not going to ingest
something accidentally,

00:04:14.947 --> 00:04:17.336
which will mess up her doping tests

00:04:18.593 --> 00:04:22.072
and kick her out of the sports she loves.

00:04:23.084 --> 00:04:26.335
Finally, we alight in Ghana,

00:04:26.359 --> 00:04:28.122
my own home country,

00:04:28.146 --> 00:04:30.960
where another problem needs addressing --

00:04:30.984 --> 00:04:34.125
the problem of under-vaccination
or poor-quality vaccination.

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:39.623
You see, when you put some vaccines
into the bloodstream of an infant,

00:04:39.647 --> 00:04:42.517
you are giving them a lifetime insurance

00:04:42.541 --> 00:04:46.530
against dangerous diseases
that can cripple them or kill them.

00:04:46.554 --> 00:04:48.459
Sometimes, this is for a lifetime.

00:04:48.483 --> 00:04:53.564
The problem is that vaccines
are delicate organisms really,

00:04:53.588 --> 00:04:56.751
and they need to be stored
between two degrees and eight degrees.

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.577
And if you don't do that,
they lose their potency,

00:05:00.601 --> 00:05:03.108
and they no longer confer the immunity

00:05:03.132 --> 00:05:04.966
the child deserves.

00:05:05.704 --> 00:05:08.441
Working with computer vision scientists,

00:05:08.465 --> 00:05:13.067
we've converted simple markers
on the vials of vaccines

00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:15.535
into what you might regard
as crude thermometers.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.769
So then, these patterns change slowly
over time in response to temperature

00:05:19.793 --> 00:05:23.475
until they leave a distinct pattern
on the surface of the vaccine,

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:26.928
such that a nurse,
with a scan of the phone,

00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:31.111
can detect if the vaccine was stored
properly in the right temperature

00:05:31.135 --> 00:05:33.124
and therefore is still good for use

00:05:33.148 --> 00:05:35.360
before administering this to the child --

00:05:36.514 --> 00:05:39.183
literally securing the next generation.

00:05:39.207 --> 00:05:45.082
These are some of the solutions at work
saving lives, redeeming societies,

00:05:45.106 --> 00:05:46.808
in these parts of the world.

00:05:46.832 --> 00:05:48.468
But I would remind you

00:05:48.492 --> 00:05:51.065
that there are powerful ideas behind them,

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:52.328
and I'll recap a few.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.359
One, that social trust
is not the same as interpersonal trust.

00:05:58.128 --> 00:06:01.319
Two, that the division between
consumption and regulation

00:06:01.343 --> 00:06:03.571
in an increasingly interdependent world

00:06:03.595 --> 00:06:04.826
is no longer viable.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.077
And three, that decentralized autonomy,

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:11.023
regardless of what our blockchain
enthusiasts in the West --

00:06:11.047 --> 00:06:12.391
whom I respect a lot -- say,

00:06:12.415 --> 00:06:17.555
are not as important as reinforcing
social accountability feedback loops.

00:06:17.579 --> 00:06:18.985
These are some of the ideas.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.701
Now, every time I go somewhere
and I give this speech

00:06:22.725 --> 00:06:26.849
and I make these comments
and I provide these examples,

00:06:26.873 --> 00:06:29.234
people say, "If these ideas
are so damn brilliant,

00:06:29.258 --> 00:06:30.588
why aren't they everywhere?

00:06:30.612 --> 00:06:31.946
I've never heard of them."

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.171
I want to assure you,

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:36.547
the reason why you have not
heard of these ideas

00:06:36.571 --> 00:06:39.467
is exactly the point I made
in the beginning.

00:06:40.142 --> 00:06:43.514
And that is that there are
parts of the world

00:06:43.538 --> 00:06:46.337
whose good ideas simply don't scale

00:06:46.361 --> 00:06:48.629
because of the latitude
on which they were born.

00:06:48.653 --> 00:06:51.256
I call that "mental latitude imperialism."

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.280
(Laughter)

00:06:53.652 --> 00:06:55.441
That really is the reason.

00:06:55.465 --> 00:06:58.689
But you may counter and say, "Well,
maybe it's an important problem,

00:06:58.713 --> 00:07:01.452
but it's sort of an obscure problem
in parts of the world.

00:07:01.476 --> 00:07:03.534
Why do you want
to globalize such problems?

00:07:03.558 --> 00:07:05.070
I mean, they are better local."

00:07:05.094 --> 00:07:06.664
What if, in response, I told you

00:07:07.982 --> 00:07:11.921
that actually, underlying each
of these problems that I've described

00:07:11.945 --> 00:07:14.391
is a fundamental issue
of the breakdown of trust

00:07:14.415 --> 00:07:16.090
in markets and institutions,

00:07:16.114 --> 00:07:19.571
and that there's nothing more global,
more universal, closer to you and I

00:07:19.595 --> 00:07:20.917
than the problem of trust.

00:07:21.502 --> 00:07:27.940
For example, a quarter of all the seafood
marketed in the US is falsely labeled.

00:07:27.964 --> 00:07:30.579
So when you buy a tuna
or salmon sandwich in Manhattan,

00:07:30.603 --> 00:07:34.016
you are eating something that could be
banned for being toxic in Japan.

00:07:34.575 --> 00:07:35.936
Literally.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.654
Most of you have heard of a time
when horsemeat was masquerading as beef

00:07:40.678 --> 00:07:42.242
in burger patties in Europe?

00:07:42.266 --> 00:07:43.432
You have.

00:07:43.456 --> 00:07:49.171
What you don't know is that a good chunk
of these fake meat patties

00:07:49.195 --> 00:07:53.121
were also contaminated with cadmium,
which can damage your kidneys.

00:07:53.145 --> 00:07:54.400
This was Europe.

00:07:55.026 --> 00:07:58.558
Many of you are aware of plane crashes
and you worry about plane crashes,

00:07:58.582 --> 00:08:02.237
because every now and then, one of them
intrudes into your consciousness.

00:08:02.261 --> 00:08:04.213
But I bet you don't know

00:08:04.237 --> 00:08:08.559
that a single investigation uncovered
one million counterfeit incidents

00:08:08.583 --> 00:08:11.254
in the aeronautical
supply chain in the US.

00:08:11.278 --> 00:08:14.472
So this is a global problem, full stop.

00:08:14.934 --> 00:08:16.085
It's a global problem.

00:08:16.109 --> 00:08:19.369
The only reason we are not addressing it
with the urgency it deserves

00:08:19.393 --> 00:08:20.695
is that the best solutions,

00:08:20.719 --> 00:08:23.570
the most advanced solutions,
the most progressive solutions,

00:08:23.594 --> 00:08:26.948
are, unfortunately, in parts of the world
where solutions don't scale.

00:08:26.972 --> 00:08:28.715
And that is why it is not surprising

00:08:28.739 --> 00:08:32.196
that attempts to create this same
verification models for pharmaceuticals

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.578
are now a decade behind
in the USA and Europe,

00:08:35.602 --> 00:08:37.547
while it's already available in Nigeria.

00:08:37.571 --> 00:08:39.679
A decade, and costing
a hundred times more.

00:08:39.703 --> 00:08:42.533
And that is why, when you walk
into a Walgreens in New York,

00:08:42.557 --> 00:08:44.661
you cannot check the source
of your medicine,

00:08:44.685 --> 00:08:46.846
but you can in Maiduguri
in Northern Nigeria.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.023
That is the reality.

00:08:48.047 --> 00:08:49.131
(Applause)

00:08:49.155 --> 00:08:50.336
That is the reality.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.488
(Applause)

00:08:52.512 --> 00:08:54.611
So we go back to the issue of ideas.

00:08:55.222 --> 00:08:58.704
Remember, solutions are merely
packaged ideas,

00:08:58.728 --> 00:09:00.846
so it is the ideas
that are most important.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.977
In a world where we marginalize the
ideas of the Global South,

00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:08.661
we cannot create globally inclusive
problem-solving models.

00:09:08.685 --> 00:09:11.665
Now, you might say, "Well, that's bad,

00:09:11.689 --> 00:09:15.979
but in such a world
where we have so many other problems,

00:09:16.003 --> 00:09:17.533
do we need another cause?"

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.184
I say yes, we need another cause.

00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:22.706
Actually, that cause will surprise you:
the cause of intellectual justice.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:26.206
You say, "What? Intellectual justice?
In a world of human rights abuses?"

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:27.593
And I explain this way:

00:09:27.617 --> 00:09:31.943
all the solutions to the other problems
that affect us and confront us

00:09:31.967 --> 00:09:33.140
need solutions.

00:09:33.164 --> 00:09:35.414
So you need the best ideas
to address them.

00:09:35.438 --> 00:09:37.434
And that is why today I ask you,

00:09:37.458 --> 00:09:40.760
can we all give it one time
for intellectual justice?

00:09:42.034 --> 00:09:45.531
(Applause)
