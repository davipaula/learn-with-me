00:00:06.828 --> 00:00:09.738
We know about our universe’s past:

00:00:09.738 --> 00:00:14.258
the Big Bang theory predicts that all 
matter, time, and space

00:00:14.258 --> 00:00:20.598
began in an incredibly tiny, compact 
state about 14 billion years ago.

00:00:20.598 --> 00:00:22.433
And we know about the present:

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:25.993
scientists’ observations of the movement 
of galaxies

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:30.083
tell us that the universe is expanding 
at an accelerated rate.

00:00:30.085 --> 00:00:31.695
But what about the future?

00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:35.095
Do we know how our universe 
is going to end?

00:00:35.095 --> 00:00:38.685
Cosmologists have three 
possible answers for this question,

00:00:38.685 --> 00:00:40.415
called the Big Freeze,

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:43.855
the Big Rip and the Big Crunch.

00:00:43.855 --> 00:00:46.215
To understand these three scenarios,

00:00:46.215 --> 00:00:49.885
imagine two objects representing galaxies.

00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:53.425
A short, tight rubber band is 
holding them together—

00:00:53.425 --> 00:00:56.235
that’s the attractive force of gravity.

00:00:56.235 --> 00:00:59.725
Meanwhile, two hooks are 
pulling them apart—

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:03.495
that’s the repulsive force 
expanding the universe.

00:01:03.495 --> 00:01:06.215
Copy this system over and over again,

00:01:06.215 --> 00:01:09.525
and you have something 
approximating the real universe.

00:01:09.525 --> 00:01:13.095
The outcome of the battle between 
these two opposing forces

00:01:13.095 --> 00:01:16.725
determines how the end of the 
universe will play out.

00:01:16.725 --> 00:01:22.035
The Big Freeze scenario is what happens 
if the force pulling the objects apart

00:01:22.035 --> 00:01:27.565
is just strong enough to stretch the 
rubber band until it loses its elasticity.

00:01:27.565 --> 00:01:30.771
The expansion wouldn’t be able to 
accelerate anymore,

00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:33.191
but the universe would keep 
getting bigger.

00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:36.091
Clusters of galaxies would separate.

00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:38.341
The objects within the galaxies–

00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:41.041
suns, planets, and solar systems

00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:42.671
would move away from each other,

00:01:42.671 --> 00:01:45.581
until galaxies dissolved into 
lonely objects

00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:48.551
floating separately in the vast space.

00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:51.961
The light they emit would be redshifted 
to long wavelengths

00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:54.581
with very low, faint energies,

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:59.281
and the gas emanating from them 
would be too thin to create new stars.

00:01:59.281 --> 00:02:02.270
The universe would become 
darker and colder,

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.650
approaching a frozen state

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.500
also known as the Big Chill,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.380
or the Heat Death of the Universe.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.340
But what if the repulsive force 
is so strong

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.080
that it stretches the rubber band 
past its elastic limit,

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.870
and actually tears it?

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.990
If the expansion of the universe 
continues to accelerate,

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.760
it will eventually overcome not only 
the gravitational force –

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.480
tearing apart galaxies and solar systems–

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.960
but also the electromagnetic, weak, 
and strong nuclear forces

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.716
which hold atoms and nuclei together.

00:02:33.716 --> 00:02:34.566
As a result,

00:02:34.566 --> 00:02:38.806
the matter that makes up stars 
breaks into tiny pieces.

00:02:38.806 --> 00:02:42.227
Even atoms and subatomic particles 
will be destroyed.

00:02:42.227 --> 00:02:44.967
That’s the Big Rip.

00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:46.607
What about the third scenario,

00:02:46.607 --> 00:02:48.877
where the rubber band wins out?

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:51.577
That corresponds to a possible future

00:02:51.577 --> 00:02:55.917
in which the force of gravity brings the 
universe’s expansion to a halt—

00:02:55.917 --> 00:02:58.195
and then reverses it.

00:02:58.195 --> 00:03:01.005
Galaxies would start rushing 
towards each other,

00:03:01.005 --> 00:03:02.495
and as they clumped together

00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:06.015
their gravitational pull would 
get even stronger.

00:03:06.015 --> 00:03:09.205
Stars too would hurtle 
together and collide.

00:03:09.205 --> 00:03:13.205
Temperatures would rise as space 
would get tighter and tighter.

00:03:13.205 --> 00:03:15.485
The size of the universe would plummet

00:03:15.485 --> 00:03:19.165
until everything compressed into such 
a small space

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:24.165
that even atoms and subatomic particles 
would have to crunch together.

00:03:24.165 --> 00:03:29.666
The result would be an incredibly dense,
hot, compact universe —

00:03:29.666 --> 00:03:32.346
a lot like the state that 
preceded the Big Bang.

00:03:32.346 --> 00:03:35.276
This is the Big Crunch.

00:03:35.276 --> 00:03:39.576
Could this tiny point of matter explode 
in another Big Bang?

00:03:39.576 --> 00:03:43.419
Could the universe expand and contract
over and over again,

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.729
repeating its entire history?

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:50.119
The theory describing such a universe 
is known as the Big Bounce.

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:54.829
In fact, there’s no way to tell how many 
bounces could’ve already happened—

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.447
or how many might happen in the future.

00:03:57.447 --> 00:04:03.037
Each bounce would wipe away any record
of the universe’s previous history.

00:04:03.037 --> 00:04:06.023
Which one of those scenarios 
will be the real one?

00:04:06.023 --> 00:04:09.253
The answer depends on the exact shape 
of the universe,

00:04:09.253 --> 00:04:11.543
the amount of dark energy it holds,

00:04:11.543 --> 00:04:14.133
and changes in its expansion rate.

00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:18.953
As of now, our observations suggest 
that we’re heading for a Big Freeze.

00:04:18.953 --> 00:04:24.443
But the good news is that we’ve probably 
got about 10 to the 100th power years

00:04:24.443 --> 00:04:26.233
before the chill sets in —

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:30.233
so don’t start stocking up 
on mittens just yet.
