00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.959
I'm here to talk about climate change,

00:00:14.983 --> 00:00:18.129
but I'm not really an environmentalist.

00:00:18.563 --> 00:00:21.880
In fact, I've never really
thought of myself as a nature person.

00:00:21.904 --> 00:00:25.106
I have never gone camping,
never gone hiking,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.597
never even owned a pet.

00:00:27.546 --> 00:00:29.299
I've lived my whole life in cities,

00:00:29.323 --> 00:00:31.022
actually just one city.

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:33.942
And while I like to take trips
to visit nature,

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:37.442
I always thought it was something
that was happening elsewhere,

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:38.815
far away,

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:43.833
with all of modern life
a fortress against its forces.

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:45.840
In other words,

00:00:45.864 --> 00:00:48.594
like just about everybody I knew,

00:00:48.618 --> 00:00:51.665
I lived my life complacent

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:53.150
and deluded

00:00:53.174 --> 00:00:55.641
about the threat from global warming.

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:59.305
Which I took to be happening slowly,

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.448
happening at a distance

00:01:01.472 --> 00:01:05.940
and representing only a modest threat
to the way that I lived.

00:01:07.165 --> 00:01:08.982
In each of these ways,

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:12.085
I was very, very wrong.

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:16.356
Now most people, if they were telling you
about climate change,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.259
will tell you a story about the future.

00:01:18.283 --> 00:01:19.942
If I was doing that, I would say,

00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:22.327
"According to the UN,
if we don't change course,

00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:23.593
by the end of the century,

00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:26.379
we're likely to get about four degrees
Celsius of warming."

00:01:26.403 --> 00:01:29.359
That would mean, some scientists believe,

00:01:29.383 --> 00:01:31.041
twice as much war,

00:01:31.065 --> 00:01:32.418
half as much food,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.101
a global GDP possibly 20 percent smaller
than it would be without climate change.

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:42.283
That's an impact that's deeper
than the Great Depression,

00:01:42.307 --> 00:01:44.041
and it would be permanent.

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:48.308
But the impacts are actually happening
a lot faster than 2100.

00:01:48.332 --> 00:01:50.301
By just 2050, it's estimated,

00:01:50.325 --> 00:01:53.761
many of the biggest cities
in South Asia and the Middle East

00:01:53.785 --> 00:01:57.340
will be almost literally
unlivably hot in summer.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.410
These are cities that today are
home to 10, 12, 15 million people.

00:02:04.887 --> 00:02:07.110
And in just three decades,

00:02:07.134 --> 00:02:09.532
you wouldn't be able
to walk around outside in them

00:02:09.556 --> 00:02:12.531
without risking heatstroke
or possibly death.

00:02:13.088 --> 00:02:16.207
The planet is now
1.1 degrees Celsius warmer

00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:18.592
than it was before industrialization.

00:02:18.616 --> 00:02:20.751
That may not sound like a lot,

00:02:20.775 --> 00:02:24.695
but it actually puts us entirely
outside the window of temperatures

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.431
that enclose all of human history.

00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:32.650
That means that everything
we have ever known as a species,

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.204
the evolution of the human animal,

00:02:36.228 --> 00:02:38.276
the development of agriculture,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.332
the development
of rudimentary civilization

00:02:40.356 --> 00:02:43.363
and modern civilization
and industrial civilization,

00:02:43.387 --> 00:02:47.871
everything we know about ourselves
as biological creatures,

00:02:47.895 --> 00:02:51.037
as social creatures,
as political creatures,

00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:53.728
all of it is the result
of climate conditions

00:02:53.752 --> 00:02:56.434
we have already left behind.

00:02:57.752 --> 00:03:02.331
It's like we've landed
on an entirely different planet,

00:03:02.355 --> 00:03:04.696
with an entirely different climate.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.332
And we now have to figure out

00:03:06.356 --> 00:03:09.410
what of the civilization
that we've brought with us

00:03:09.434 --> 00:03:12.371
can endure these new conditions

00:03:12.395 --> 00:03:13.545
and what can't.

00:03:14.947 --> 00:03:17.034
And things will get worse from here.

00:03:17.812 --> 00:03:19.860
Now for a very long time,

00:03:19.884 --> 00:03:22.978
we were told that climate change
was a slow saga.

00:03:23.455 --> 00:03:25.720
It started with the industrial revolution,

00:03:25.744 --> 00:03:27.315
and it had fallen to us

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:29.450
to clean up the mess
left by our grandparents

00:03:29.474 --> 00:03:32.196
so our grandchildren
wouldn't be dealing with the results.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.087
It was a story of centuries.

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:37.943
In fact, half of all of the emissions

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:41.165
that have ever been produced
from the burning of fossil fuels

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:43.624
in the entire history of humanity

00:03:43.648 --> 00:03:47.101
have been produced
in just the last 30 years.

00:03:47.942 --> 00:03:51.164
That's since Al Gore published
his first book on warming.

00:03:51.506 --> 00:03:54.997
It's since the UN established
its IPCC climate change body.

00:03:55.363 --> 00:03:58.101
We've done more damage since then

00:03:58.125 --> 00:04:01.648
than in all the centuries,
all the millennia before.

00:04:02.355 --> 00:04:04.331
Now I'm 37 years old,

00:04:04.355 --> 00:04:07.402
which means my life contains
this entire story.

00:04:07.863 --> 00:04:12.180
When I was born,
the planet's climate seemed stable.

00:04:13.447 --> 00:04:15.320
Today,

00:04:15.344 --> 00:04:17.677
we are on the brink of catastrophe.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.709
The climate crisis
is not the legacy of our ancestors.

00:04:23.387 --> 00:04:26.471
It is the work of a single generation.

00:04:27.609 --> 00:04:28.759
Ours.

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:31.699
This may all sound like bad news.

00:04:31.723 --> 00:04:33.643
Which it is, really bad news.

00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:36.048
But it also contains, I think,

00:04:36.072 --> 00:04:39.405
some good news,
at least relatively speaking.

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:41.896
These impacts are terrifyingly large.

00:04:42.322 --> 00:04:45.885
But they are also, I think, exhilarating.

00:04:47.268 --> 00:04:49.760
Because they are ultimately a reflection

00:04:49.784 --> 00:04:53.243
of how much power we have
over the climate.

00:04:53.807 --> 00:04:56.260
If we get to those hellish scenarios,

00:04:56.284 --> 00:04:58.871
it will be because
we have made them happen,

00:04:58.895 --> 00:05:01.828
because we have chosen
to make them happen.

00:05:02.657 --> 00:05:07.037
Which means we can choose
to make other scenarios happen, too.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.822
Now that may seem too rosy to believe

00:05:10.846 --> 00:05:14.246
and the political obstacles
are in fact enormous.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.271
But it is a simple fact --

00:05:16.295 --> 00:05:18.629
the main driver of global warming
is human action:

00:05:18.653 --> 00:05:20.704
How much carbon
we put into the atmosphere.

00:05:20.728 --> 00:05:22.728
Our hands are on those levers.

00:05:23.046 --> 00:05:27.543
And we can write the story
of the planet's climate future ourselves.

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:30.667
Not just can -- but are.

00:05:30.691 --> 00:05:33.714
Since inaction is a kind of action,

00:05:33.738 --> 00:05:37.548
we'll be writing that story ourselves
whether we like it or not.

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.468
This is not just any story,

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:45.061
all of us holding the future
of the planet in our hands.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.429
It's the kind of story
we used to recognize only in mythology

00:05:50.453 --> 00:05:51.603
and theology.

00:05:51.982 --> 00:05:53.363
A single generation

00:05:53.387 --> 00:05:56.219
that has brought the future
of humanity into doubt

00:05:56.243 --> 00:05:59.514
now tasked with securing a new future.

00:06:01.657 --> 00:06:03.243
So what would that look like?

00:06:03.791 --> 00:06:08.009
It could mean solar arrays
barnacling the planet,

00:06:08.033 --> 00:06:09.771
really everywhere you looked.

00:06:10.105 --> 00:06:12.977
It could mean if we developed
better technology,

00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:15.763
we wouldn't even need
to deploy them that broadly,

00:06:15.787 --> 00:06:19.206
because it's been estimated
that just a sliver of the Sahara desert

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.504
absorbs enough solar power
to provide all the world's energy needs.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.976
But we'd probably need
a new electric grid,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.984
one that doesn't lose
two-thirds of its power to waste heat,

00:06:29.008 --> 00:06:31.458
as is today the case in the US.

00:06:31.482 --> 00:06:34.299
We could use some more
nuclear power, perhaps,

00:06:34.323 --> 00:06:37.768
although it would have to be an entirely
different kind of nuclear power,

00:06:37.792 --> 00:06:40.434
because today's technology
simply isn't cost-competitive

00:06:40.458 --> 00:06:43.504
with renewable energy
whose costs are falling so rapidly.

00:06:44.402 --> 00:06:46.291
We'd need a new kind of plane,

00:06:46.315 --> 00:06:48.957
because I don't think
it's particularly practical

00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:51.290
to ask the entire world
to give up on air travel,

00:06:51.314 --> 00:06:53.274
especially as so much of the global South

00:06:53.298 --> 00:06:55.486
is, for the very first time,
able to afford it.

00:06:56.558 --> 00:06:58.828
We need planes that won't produce carbon.

00:06:58.852 --> 00:07:01.209
We need a new kind of agriculture.

00:07:01.233 --> 00:07:05.003
Because we probably can't ask people
to entirely give up on meat and go vegan,

00:07:05.027 --> 00:07:06.950
it would mean a new way of raising beef.

00:07:06.974 --> 00:07:08.767
Or perhaps an old way,

00:07:08.791 --> 00:07:12.077
since we already know
that traditional pasturing practices

00:07:12.101 --> 00:07:13.986
can turn cattle farms

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.157
from what are called carbon sources,
which produce CO2,

00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:19.243
into carbon sinks, which absorb them.

00:07:19.658 --> 00:07:21.190
If you prefer a techno solution,

00:07:21.214 --> 00:07:23.737
maybe we can grow
some of that mean in the lab.

00:07:23.761 --> 00:07:26.349
Probably, we could also feed
some real cattle seaweed,

00:07:26.373 --> 00:07:30.563
because that cuts their methane emissions
by as much as 95 or 99 percent.

00:07:31.841 --> 00:07:34.020
Probably, we'd have to do
all of these things,

00:07:34.044 --> 00:07:36.777
because as with every aspect
of this puzzle,

00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:39.793
the problem is simply
too vast and complicated

00:07:39.817 --> 00:07:42.925
to solve in any single silver-bullet way.

00:07:44.212 --> 00:07:46.894
And no matter how many
solutions we deploy,

00:07:46.918 --> 00:07:50.251
we probably won't be able
to decarbonize in time.

00:07:50.743 --> 00:07:52.712
That's the terrifying math that we face.

00:07:53.538 --> 00:07:56.863
We won't be able to beat climate change,

00:07:56.887 --> 00:07:58.953
only live with it and limit it.

00:07:59.776 --> 00:08:01.379
And that means we'd probably need

00:08:01.403 --> 00:08:03.744
some amount of what are called
negative emissions,

00:08:03.768 --> 00:08:06.514
which take carbon
out of the atmosphere as well.

00:08:06.538 --> 00:08:09.879
Billions of new trees,
maybe trillions of new trees.

00:08:10.385 --> 00:08:13.821
And whole plantations
of carbon-capture machines.

00:08:13.845 --> 00:08:17.076
Perhaps an industry
twice or four times the size

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.281
of today's oil and gas business

00:08:19.305 --> 00:08:23.582
to undo the damage that was done
by those businesses in past decades.

00:08:24.202 --> 00:08:26.884
We would need a new kind
of infrastructure,

00:08:26.908 --> 00:08:29.040
poured by a different kind of cement,

00:08:29.064 --> 00:08:30.982
because today, if cement were a country,

00:08:31.006 --> 00:08:33.609
it would be the world's
third biggest emitter.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.879
And China is pouring as much cement
every three years

00:08:36.903 --> 00:08:40.325
as the US poured
in the entire 20th century.

00:08:40.349 --> 00:08:42.975
We would need to build seawalls and levees

00:08:42.999 --> 00:08:45.952
to protect those people
living on the coast,

00:08:45.976 --> 00:08:48.498
many of whom are too poor
to build them today,

00:08:48.522 --> 00:08:55.116
which is why it must mean an end
to a narrowly nationalistic geopolitics

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.022
that allows us to define the suffering
of those living elsewhere in the world

00:08:59.046 --> 00:09:00.196
as insignificant,

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:02.133
when we even acknowledge it.

00:09:02.157 --> 00:09:04.325
This better future won't be easy.

00:09:05.472 --> 00:09:08.368
But the only obstacles are human ones.

00:09:08.789 --> 00:09:10.575
That may not be much of a comfort,

00:09:10.599 --> 00:09:13.736
if you know what I know
about human brutality and indifference,

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.553
but I promise you,
it is better than the alternative.

00:09:16.577 --> 00:09:18.900
Science isn't stopping us
from taking action,

00:09:18.924 --> 00:09:20.658
and neither is technology.

00:09:21.593 --> 00:09:24.632
We have the tools we need today to begin.

00:09:25.585 --> 00:09:29.125
Of course, we also have the tools we need
to end global poverty,

00:09:29.149 --> 00:09:30.631
epidemic disease

00:09:30.655 --> 00:09:32.722
and the abuse of women as well.

00:09:33.093 --> 00:09:37.514
Which is why more than new tools,
we need a new politics,

00:09:37.538 --> 00:09:40.903
a way of overcoming
all those human obstacles --

00:09:40.927 --> 00:09:42.855
our culture, our economics,

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:44.315
our status quo bias,

00:09:44.339 --> 00:09:47.767
our disinterest in taking seriously
anything that really scares us.

00:09:48.149 --> 00:09:49.549
Our shortsightedness.

00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:51.655
Our sense of self-interest.

00:09:51.974 --> 00:09:55.323
And the selfishness
of the world's rich and powerful

00:09:55.347 --> 00:09:57.947
who have the least incentive
to change anything.

00:09:58.717 --> 00:10:00.590
Now, they will suffer too,

00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:04.153
but not as much as those with the least,

00:10:04.177 --> 00:10:06.907
who have done the least 
to produce warming

00:10:06.931 --> 00:10:08.586
and have benefited the least

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.760
from the processes that have brought us
to this crisis point

00:10:11.784 --> 00:10:14.282
but will be burdened most
in the decades ahead.

00:10:15.077 --> 00:10:16.410
A new politics

00:10:16.434 --> 00:10:18.738
would make the matter
of managing that burden,

00:10:19.768 --> 00:10:22.348
where it falls and how heavily,

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:25.135
the top priority of our time.

00:10:26.768 --> 00:10:31.612
No matter what we do,
climate change will transform modern life.

00:10:33.776 --> 00:10:37.649
Some amount of warming
is already baked in and is inevitable,

00:10:37.673 --> 00:10:40.918
which means probably some amount
of additional suffering is, too.

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.307
And even if we take dramatic action

00:10:43.331 --> 00:10:46.696
and avoid some of these
truly terrifying worst-case scenarios,

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:50.565
it would mean living
on an entirely different planet.

00:10:51.193 --> 00:10:54.162
With a new politics, a new economics,

00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:56.376
a new relationship to technology

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.709
and a new relationship to nature --

00:10:58.733 --> 00:11:01.462
a whole new world.

00:11:02.336 --> 00:11:04.270
But a relatively livable one.

00:11:05.074 --> 00:11:06.860
Relatively prosperous.

00:11:07.987 --> 00:11:09.137
And green.

00:11:10.392 --> 00:11:12.587
Why not choose that one?

00:11:13.929 --> 00:11:15.079
Thank you.

00:11:15.103 --> 00:11:19.992
(Applause)
