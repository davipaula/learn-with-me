00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:17.656
Let me tell you a story.

00:00:18.228 --> 00:00:21.975
It's my first year as a new
high school science teacher,

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:23.295
and I'm so eager.

00:00:23.787 --> 00:00:27.795
I'm so excited, I'm pouring
myself into my lesson plans.

00:00:28.953 --> 00:00:33.786
But I'm slowly coming
to this horrifying realization

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.341
that my students just might
not be learning anything.

00:00:38.865 --> 00:00:40.572
This happens one day:

00:00:40.596 --> 00:00:43.730
I'd just assigned my class
to read this textbook chapter

00:00:43.754 --> 00:00:46.804
about my favorite subject
in all of biology:

00:00:47.495 --> 00:00:50.177
viruses and how they attack.

00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:53.315
And so I'm so excited
to discuss this with them,

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:56.686
and I come in and I say,
"Can somebody please explain

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.805
the main ideas and why this is so cool?"

00:01:01.072 --> 00:01:02.247
There's silence.

00:01:04.612 --> 00:01:07.572
Finally, my favorite student,
she looks me straight in the eye,

00:01:07.596 --> 00:01:10.144
and she says, "The reading sucked."

00:01:10.517 --> 00:01:11.969
(Laughter)

00:01:12.785 --> 00:01:14.080
And then she clarified.

00:01:14.104 --> 00:01:16.603
She said, "You know what,
I don't mean that it sucks.

00:01:16.627 --> 00:01:18.665
I mean I didn't understand a word of it.

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.252
It's boring, who cares, and it sucks."

00:01:22.713 --> 00:01:24.569
(Laughter)

00:01:24.593 --> 00:01:29.459
These sympathetic smiles
spread all throughout the room now,

00:01:29.483 --> 00:01:34.292
and I realize that all of my other
students are in the same boat,

00:01:34.316 --> 00:01:38.204
that maybe they took notes or memorized
definitions from the textbook,

00:01:38.228 --> 00:01:43.307
but not one of them
really understood the main ideas.

00:01:43.331 --> 00:01:45.981
Not one of them can tell me
why this stuff is so cool,

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:47.338
why it's so important.

00:01:49.497 --> 00:01:51.417
I'm totally clueless.

00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:54.036
I have no idea what to do next.

00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:57.623
So the only thing I can think of is say,

00:01:57.647 --> 00:02:00.337
"Listen. Let me tell you a story.

00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:07.591
The main characters in the story
are bacteria and viruses.

00:02:07.615 --> 00:02:10.417
These guys are blown up
a couple million times.

00:02:11.091 --> 00:02:14.233
The real bacteria and viruses are so small

00:02:14.257 --> 00:02:16.511
we can't see them without a microscope,

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:18.645
and you guys might know
bacteria and viruses

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:20.233
because they both make us sick.

00:02:20.796 --> 00:02:22.692
But what a lot of people don't know

00:02:22.716 --> 00:02:26.478
is that viruses
can also make bacteria sick."

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.795
Now, the story
that I start telling my kids,

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.906
it starts out like a horror story.

00:02:34.147 --> 00:02:37.140
Once upon a time,
there's this happy little bacterium.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.217
Don't get too attached to him.

00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:40.933
(Laughter)

00:02:40.957 --> 00:02:43.623
Maybe he's floating around in your stomach

00:02:43.647 --> 00:02:45.821
or in some spoiled food somewhere,

00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:49.449
and all of a sudden,
he starts to not feel so good.

00:02:49.473 --> 00:02:52.051
Maybe he ate something bad for lunch.

00:02:52.075 --> 00:02:54.614
And then things get really horrible,

00:02:54.638 --> 00:02:56.235
as his skin rips apart,

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:59.753
and he sees a virus
coming out from his insides.

00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:04.311
And then it gets horrible
when he bursts open

00:03:04.335 --> 00:03:08.058
and an army of viruses
floods out from his insides.

00:03:09.896 --> 00:03:11.833
"Ouch" is right.

00:03:12.903 --> 00:03:15.427
If you see this, and you're a bacterium,

00:03:15.451 --> 00:03:18.265
this is like your worst nightmare.

00:03:18.673 --> 00:03:21.029
But if you're a virus and you see this,

00:03:21.053 --> 00:03:24.069
you cross those little legs
of yours and you think,

00:03:24.093 --> 00:03:25.600
"We rock."

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.346
Because it took a lot of crafty work
to infect this bacterium.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.676
Here's what had to happen.

00:03:33.247 --> 00:03:36.429
A virus grabbed onto a bacterium

00:03:36.453 --> 00:03:38.961
and it slipped its DNA into it.

00:03:40.063 --> 00:03:43.420
The next thing
is that virus DNA made stuff

00:03:43.444 --> 00:03:46.428
that chopped up the bacteria DNA.

00:03:47.705 --> 00:03:50.141
And now that we've gotten rid
of the bacteria DNA,

00:03:50.165 --> 00:03:53.970
the virus DNA takes control of the cell

00:03:53.994 --> 00:03:57.470
and it tells it to start
making more viruses.

00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:01.795
Because, you see, DNA is like a blueprint

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.168
that tells living things what to make.

00:04:05.423 --> 00:04:08.803
So this is kind of like going
into a car factory

00:04:08.827 --> 00:04:13.779
and replacing the blueprints
with blueprints for killer robots.

00:04:14.525 --> 00:04:17.469
The workers still come
the next day, they do their job,

00:04:17.493 --> 00:04:20.056
but they're following
different instructions.

00:04:20.784 --> 00:04:24.537
So replacing the bacteria
DNA with virus DNA

00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:29.383
turns the bacteria into a factory
for making viruses --

00:04:29.407 --> 00:04:33.161
that is, until it's so filled
with viruses that it bursts.

00:04:34.156 --> 00:04:37.536
But that's not the only way
that viruses infect bacteria.

00:04:38.085 --> 00:04:41.543
Some are much more crafty.

00:04:41.567 --> 00:04:42.717
(Laughter)

00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:49.036
When a secret agent virus
infects a bacterium,

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.822
they do a little espionage.

00:04:51.495 --> 00:04:55.596
Here, this cloaked, secret agent virus

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.383
is slipping his DNA
into the bacterial cell,

00:04:58.407 --> 00:05:00.002
but here's the kicker:

00:05:00.026 --> 00:05:03.899
It doesn't do anything
harmful -- not at first.

00:05:04.303 --> 00:05:09.858
Instead, it silently slips
into the bacteria's own DNA,

00:05:09.882 --> 00:05:14.580
and it just stays there
like a terrorist sleeper cell,

00:05:14.604 --> 00:05:16.728
waiting for instructions.

00:05:17.474 --> 00:05:23.172
And what's interesting about this is now,
whenever this bacteria has babies,

00:05:23.196 --> 00:05:28.315
the babies also have
the virus DNA in them.

00:05:29.013 --> 00:05:32.846
So now we have a whole
extended bacteria family,

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.671
filled with virus sleeper cells.

00:05:36.366 --> 00:05:41.111
They're just happily living together
until a signal happens

00:05:41.135 --> 00:05:45.579
and bam! -- all of the DNA pops out.

00:05:45.603 --> 00:05:49.245
It takes control of these cells,
turns them into virus-making factories,

00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:51.061
and they all burst,

00:05:51.085 --> 00:05:53.783
a huge, extended bacteria family,

00:05:53.807 --> 00:05:56.928
all dying with viruses
spilling out of their guts,

00:05:56.952 --> 00:05:59.944
the viruses taking over the bacterium.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.491
So now you understand
how viruses can attack cells.

00:06:06.015 --> 00:06:07.619
There are two ways:

00:06:07.643 --> 00:06:10.602
On the left is what we call the lytic way,

00:06:10.626 --> 00:06:13.935
where the viruses go right in
and take over the cells.

00:06:14.538 --> 00:06:17.609
On the [right] is the lysogenic way

00:06:17.633 --> 00:06:20.021
that uses secret agent viruses.

00:06:21.204 --> 00:06:23.458
So this stuff is not that hard, right?

00:06:23.482 --> 00:06:25.481
And now all of you understand it.

00:06:25.505 --> 00:06:27.496
But if you've graduated from high school,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.306
I can almost guarantee
you've seen this information before.

00:06:30.806 --> 00:06:35.813
But I bet it was presented in a way
that it didn't exactly stick in your mind.

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:40.847
So when my students
were first learning this,

00:06:40.871 --> 00:06:42.609
why did they hate it so much?

00:06:43.212 --> 00:06:45.346
Well, there were a couple of reasons.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.521
First of all, I can guarantee you

00:06:47.545 --> 00:06:50.927
you that their textbooks
didn't have secret agent viruses,

00:06:50.951 --> 00:06:53.417
and they didn't have horror stories.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.646
You know, in the communication of science,

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.694
there is this obsession with seriousness.

00:07:00.718 --> 00:07:02.820
It kills me. I'm not kidding.

00:07:02.844 --> 00:07:05.073
I used to work
for an educational publisher,

00:07:05.097 --> 00:07:08.756
and as a writer, I was always told
never to use stories

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.668
or fun, engaging language,

00:07:10.692 --> 00:07:15.660
because then my work might not be viewed
as "serious" and "scientific."

00:07:16.108 --> 00:07:19.179
I mean, because God
forbid somebody have fun

00:07:19.203 --> 00:07:20.971
when they're learning science.

00:07:20.995 --> 00:07:25.833
So we have this field of science
that's all about slime

00:07:25.857 --> 00:07:28.200
and color changes.

00:07:28.224 --> 00:07:29.428
Check this out.

00:07:39.756 --> 00:07:43.517
And then we have, of course,
as any good scientist has to have ...

00:07:44.375 --> 00:07:45.732
explosions!

00:07:47.163 --> 00:07:51.829
But if a textbook seems too much fun,

00:07:51.853 --> 00:07:54.449
it's somehow unscientific.

00:07:55.771 --> 00:07:58.574
Now another problem

00:07:58.598 --> 00:08:04.430
was that the language in their textbook
was truly incomprehensible.

00:08:04.978 --> 00:08:07.763
If we want to summarize that story
that I told you earlier,

00:08:07.787 --> 00:08:09.073
we could start by saying,

00:08:09.097 --> 00:08:11.239
"These viruses make copies of themselves

00:08:11.263 --> 00:08:13.597
by slipping their DNA into a bacterium."

00:08:14.263 --> 00:08:17.604
The way this showed up in the textbook,
it looked like this:

00:08:17.628 --> 00:08:20.842
"Bacteriophage replication is initiated

00:08:20.866 --> 00:08:25.508
through the introduction of viral
nucleic acid into a bacterium."

00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:30.296
That's great, perfect for 13-year-olds.

00:08:31.312 --> 00:08:32.493
But here's the thing:

00:08:32.517 --> 00:08:35.067
There are plenty of people
in science education

00:08:35.091 --> 00:08:37.247
who would look
at this and say there's no way

00:08:37.271 --> 00:08:39.688
that we could ever give that to students,

00:08:39.712 --> 00:08:44.164
because it contains some language
that isn't completely accurate.

00:08:44.926 --> 00:08:47.759
For example, I told you
that viruses have DNA.

00:08:47.783 --> 00:08:50.386
Well, a very tiny fraction of them don't.

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.354
They have something called RNA instead.

00:08:52.725 --> 00:08:56.027
So a professional science writer
would say, "That has to go.

00:08:56.051 --> 00:08:58.641
We have to change it to something
much more technical."

00:08:58.665 --> 00:09:01.393
And after a team
of professional science editors

00:09:01.417 --> 00:09:05.226
went over this really simple explanation,

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:09.654
they'd find fault
with almost every word I've used,

00:09:09.678 --> 00:09:12.583
and they'd have to change anything
that wasn't serious enough,

00:09:12.607 --> 00:09:14.322
and they'd have to change everything

00:09:14.346 --> 00:09:16.828
that wasn't 100 percent perfect.

00:09:17.804 --> 00:09:19.668
Then it would be accurate,

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:24.065
but it would be completely
impossible to understand.

00:09:24.565 --> 00:09:26.263
This is horrifying.

00:09:26.813 --> 00:09:31.682
You know, I keep talking
about this idea of telling a story,

00:09:31.706 --> 00:09:36.277
and it's like science communication
has taken on this idea

00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:39.356
of what I call the tyranny of precision,

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.511
where you can't just tell a story.

00:09:41.535 --> 00:09:47.153
It's like science has become
that horrible storyteller that we all know

00:09:47.177 --> 00:09:49.772
who gives us all the details
nobody cares about,

00:09:49.796 --> 00:09:53.621
where you're like, "Oh, I met
my friend for lunch the other day,

00:09:53.645 --> 00:09:55.438
and she was wearing these ugly jeans.

00:09:55.462 --> 00:09:58.462
I mean, they weren't really jeans,
they were more like leggings,

00:09:58.486 --> 00:10:01.120
but I guess they're actually
kind of more like jeggings,

00:10:01.144 --> 00:10:05.457
and you're just like,
"Oh my God. What is the point?"

00:10:06.036 --> 00:10:09.996
Or even worse,
science education is becoming

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.020
like that guy who always says, "Actually."

00:10:13.995 --> 00:10:15.851
You want to be like,

00:10:15.875 --> 00:10:18.986
"Oh, dude, we had to get up
in the middle of the night

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.692
and drive a hundred miles
in total darkness."

00:10:21.716 --> 00:10:26.374
And that guy's like,
"Actually, it was 87.3 miles."

00:10:26.398 --> 00:10:30.763
And you're like, "Actually, shut up!
I'm just trying to tell a story."

00:10:33.731 --> 00:10:38.540
Because good storytelling
is all about emotional connection.

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.797
We have to convince our audience

00:10:41.821 --> 00:10:44.082
that what we're talking about matters.

00:10:44.805 --> 00:10:50.036
But just as important is knowing
which details we should leave out

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.690
so that the main point still comes across.

00:10:53.539 --> 00:10:56.522
I'm reminded of what the architect
Mies van der Rohe said,

00:10:56.546 --> 00:10:59.911
and I paraphrase,
when he said that sometimes,

00:10:59.935 --> 00:11:02.863
you have to lie
in order to tell the truth.

00:11:03.498 --> 00:11:08.013
I think this sentiment is particularly
relevant to science education.

00:11:10.212 --> 00:11:16.978
Now, finally, I am often so disappointed

00:11:17.002 --> 00:11:21.549
when people think that I'm advocating
a dumbing down of science.

00:11:22.208 --> 00:11:23.358
That's not true at all.

00:11:23.906 --> 00:11:26.683
I'm currently a Ph.D. student at MIT,

00:11:26.707 --> 00:11:31.689
and I absolutely understand
the importance of detailed,

00:11:31.713 --> 00:11:36.582
specific scientific
communication between experts,

00:11:36.606 --> 00:11:40.034
but not when we're trying
to teach 13-year-olds.

00:11:41.116 --> 00:11:46.188
If a young learner
thinks that all viruses have DNA,

00:11:46.212 --> 00:11:50.242
that's not going to ruin
their chances of success in science.

00:11:51.726 --> 00:11:55.281
But if a young learner
can't understand anything in science

00:11:55.305 --> 00:11:59.240
and learns to hate it because it
all sounds like this,

00:11:59.264 --> 00:12:02.233
that will ruin their chances of success.

00:12:04.025 --> 00:12:05.331
This needs to stop ...

00:12:06.378 --> 00:12:10.172
and I wish that the change could come
from the institutions at the top

00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:11.958
that are perpetuating these problems,

00:12:11.982 --> 00:12:15.402
and I beg them,
I beseech them to just stop it.

00:12:16.788 --> 00:12:18.293
But I think that's unlikely.

00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:22.308
So we are so lucky that we have resources

00:12:22.332 --> 00:12:25.466
like the Internet, where we can
circumvent these institutions

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.546
from the bottom up.

00:12:28.853 --> 00:12:31.741
There's a growing number
of online resources

00:12:31.765 --> 00:12:35.067
that are dedicated
to just explaining science

00:12:35.091 --> 00:12:37.757
in simple, understandable ways.

00:12:38.194 --> 00:12:40.550
I dream of a Wikipedia-like website

00:12:40.574 --> 00:12:44.273
that would explain
any scientific concept you can think of

00:12:44.297 --> 00:12:47.908
in simple language
any middle schooler can understand.

00:12:48.781 --> 00:12:52.225
And I myself spend most of my free time

00:12:52.249 --> 00:12:55.352
making these science videos
that I put on YouTube.

00:12:55.873 --> 00:12:58.083
I explain chemical equilibrium

00:12:58.107 --> 00:13:01.587
using analogies to awkward
middle school dances,

00:13:01.611 --> 00:13:03.317
and I talk about fuel cells

00:13:03.341 --> 00:13:06.444
with stories about boys and girls
at a summer camp.

00:13:07.506 --> 00:13:10.910
The feedback that I get
is sometimes misspelled

00:13:10.934 --> 00:13:13.077
and it's often written in LOLcats,

00:13:13.101 --> 00:13:14.315
(Laughter)

00:13:14.339 --> 00:13:20.259
but nonetheless,
it's so appreciative, so thankful

00:13:20.283 --> 00:13:26.505
that I know this is the right way
we should be communicating science.

00:13:27.333 --> 00:13:30.380
There's still so much work
left to be done, though,

00:13:30.404 --> 00:13:33.642
and if you're involved
with science in any way,

00:13:33.666 --> 00:13:35.935
I urge you to join me.

00:13:36.356 --> 00:13:41.716
Pick up a camera, start
to write a blog, whatever,

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.168
but leave out the seriousness,
leave out the jargon.

00:13:45.589 --> 00:13:48.960
Make me laugh. Make me care.

00:13:48.984 --> 00:13:52.539
Leave out those annoying details
that nobody cares about

00:13:52.563 --> 00:13:54.912
and just get to the point.

00:13:56.309 --> 00:13:57.492
How should you start?

00:13:58.174 --> 00:14:01.886
Why don't you say,
"Listen, let me tell you a story."

00:14:03.323 --> 00:14:04.474
Thank you.
