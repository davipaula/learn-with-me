00:00:07.745 --> 00:00:11.880
In 2009, two researchers ran 
a simple experiment.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.055
They took everything we know 
about our solar system

00:00:15.055 --> 00:00:21.107
and calculated where every planet would be
up to 5 billion years in the future.

00:00:21.107 --> 00:00:25.107
To do so they ran over 2,000 
numerical simulations

00:00:25.107 --> 00:00:29.829
with the same exact initial conditions
except for one difference:

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.136
the distance between Mercury and the Sun,
modified by less than a millimeter

00:00:35.136 --> 00:00:37.796
from one simulation to the next.

00:00:37.796 --> 00:00:41.074
Shockingly, in about 1 percent 
of their simulations,

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:46.420
Mercury’s orbit changed so drastically 
that it could plunge into the Sun

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.780
or collide with Venus.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.500
Worse yet,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.983
in one simulation it destabilized
the entire inner solar system.

00:00:54.983 --> 00:00:58.983
This was no error; 
the astonishing variety in results

00:00:58.983 --> 00:01:05.058
reveals the truth that our solar system 
may be much less stable than it seems.

00:01:05.058 --> 00:01:10.239
Astrophysicists refer to this astonishing
property of gravitational systems

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:12.419
as the n-body problem.

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:15.239
While we have equations 
that can completely predict

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:17.949
the motions of two gravitating masses,

00:01:17.949 --> 00:01:23.600
our analytical tools fall short 
when faced with more populated systems.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.861
It’s actually impossible to write down
all the terms of a general formula

00:01:28.861 --> 00:01:34.771
that can exactly describe the motion
of three or more gravitating objects.

00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:41.876
Why? The issue lies in how many unknown
variables an n-body system contains.

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:45.186
Thanks to Isaac Newton, 
we can write a set of equations

00:01:45.186 --> 00:01:49.186
to describe the gravitational force 
acting between bodies.

00:01:49.186 --> 00:01:53.863
However, when trying to find a general 
solution for the unknown variables

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:55.153
in these equations,

00:01:55.153 --> 00:01:58.002
we’re faced with 
a mathematical constraint:

00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:01.833
for each unknown, 
there must be at least one equation

00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:04.043
that independently describes it.

00:02:04.043 --> 00:02:08.934
Initially, a two-body system appears 
to have more unknown variables

00:02:08.934 --> 00:02:12.724
for position and velocity 
than equations of motion.

00:02:12.724 --> 00:02:14.680
However, there’s a trick:

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.915
consider the relative position 
and velocity of the two bodies

00:02:18.915 --> 00:02:22.625
with respect to the center 
of gravity of the system.

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:27.353
This reduces the number of unknowns
and leaves us with a solvable system.

00:02:27.353 --> 00:02:33.079
With three or more orbiting objects 
in the picture, everything gets messier.

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.461
Even with the same mathematical trick 
of considering relative motions,

00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:42.088
we’re left with more unknowns 
than equations describing them.

00:02:42.088 --> 00:02:46.340
There are simply too many variables
for this system of equations

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.610
to be untangled into a general solution.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.520
But what does it actually look like 
for objects in our universe

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.631
to move according to analytically 
unsolvable equations of motion?

00:02:58.631 --> 00:03:01.881
A system of three stars—
like Alpha Centauri—

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:05.359
could come crashing
into one another or, more likely,

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.471
some might get flung out of orbit 
after a long time of apparent stability.

00:03:10.471 --> 00:03:14.471
Other than a few highly improbable 
stable configurations,

00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:20.571
almost every possible case 
is unpredictable on long timescales.

00:03:20.571 --> 00:03:24.768
Each has an astronomically large range
of potential outcomes,

00:03:24.768 --> 00:03:29.576
dependent on the tiniest of differences
in position and velocity.

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:33.742
This behaviour is known 
as chaotic by physicists,

00:03:33.742 --> 00:03:37.472
and is an important characteristic 
of n-body systems.

00:03:37.472 --> 00:03:42.201
Such a system is still deterministic—
meaning there’s nothing random about it.

00:03:42.201 --> 00:03:45.791
If multiple systems start 
from the exact same conditions,

00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:48.241
they’ll always reach the same result.

00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:53.980
But give one a little shove at the start,
and all bets are off.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.240
That’s clearly relevant 
for human space missions,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.489
when complicated orbits need 
to be calculated with great precision.

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.489
Thankfully, continuous advancements
in computer simulations

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.379
offer a number of ways
to avoid catastrophe.

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.695
By approximating the solutions 
with increasingly powerful processors,

00:04:13.695 --> 00:04:19.565
we can more confidently predict the motion
of n-body systems on long time-scales.

00:04:19.565 --> 00:04:22.755
And if one body in a group 
of three is so light

00:04:22.755 --> 00:04:25.885
it exerts no significant force 
on the other two,

00:04:25.885 --> 00:04:30.727
the system behaves, with very good 
approximation, as a two-body system.

00:04:30.727 --> 00:04:34.727
This approach is known 
as the “restricted three-body problem.”

00:04:34.727 --> 00:04:38.097
It proves extremely useful 
in describing, for example,

00:04:38.097 --> 00:04:41.607
an asteroid in the Earth-Sun 
gravitational field,

00:04:41.607 --> 00:04:46.700
or a small planet in the field 
of a black hole and a star.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.480
As for our solar system, 
you’ll be happy to hear

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.650
that we can have reasonable confidence
in its stability

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.330
for at least the next 
several hundred million years.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.020
Though if another star,

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.000
launched from across the galaxy, 
is on its way to us,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.850
all bets are off.
