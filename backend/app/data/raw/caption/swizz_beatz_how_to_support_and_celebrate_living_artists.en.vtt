00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:14.434
Swizz Beatz: I got it.

00:00:14.458 --> 00:00:16.434
So are you guys going to mute when I talk

00:00:16.458 --> 00:00:18.059
so nothing interrupts it?

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:19.351
Voice: Uhh, yes.

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:22.434
SB: Because once I'm in the flow,
I like to stay in the flow.

00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:24.809
Having some type of support

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:27.184
is very necessary when you are creative.

00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:31.851
You know, there has to be something
that's fueling that creativity,

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:34.309
that's fueling that fire
that you have inside.

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:38.434
My love for music and creativity
starts way back, way back.

00:00:38.458 --> 00:00:41.059
Back in the South Bronx where I grew up,

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:43.768
building 700, apartment 2E.

00:00:43.792 --> 00:00:47.184
I would go outside
and all I would hear is music.

00:00:47.208 --> 00:00:50.143
You go around to the back park,
the DJs are playing,

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:51.851
there's a basketball game going on,

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:54.143
but then you would look
at the handball court,

00:00:54.167 --> 00:00:57.309
and that handball court
would have an amazing graffiti mural,

00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:00.726
I don't know if it's from
Keith Haring or Fab 5 Freddy.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.601
I was instantly attracted to the creative.

00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:06.976
Music has been my therapy since day one.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.226
Anytime I get stressed out,

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.143
I go to the arts,
I go to creativity, I go to music.

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:16.726
Music makes people feel hugged,
people feel loved.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.101
And then I remember
one of my uncles saying,

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:22.059
"You should get into producing,"
I'm like, "What's producing?"

00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:24.351
You know, it started
as a family-owned business,

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:26.518
because Ruff Ryders
was created by my family.

00:01:26.542 --> 00:01:28.309
It gave you DMX, it gave you Eve,

00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.851
it gave you Drag-On, it gave you The LOX.

00:01:30.875 --> 00:01:34.518
I've gotten every accolade
in music that one can get.

00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:37.726
It just came to the point
where it's like, "You know what?

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.309
I'm no longer going to have fun with this
unless I'm able to give back."

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:46.934
You know, The Dean Collection started
for me to create a museum for my family

00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:48.268
and our name.

00:01:48.292 --> 00:01:50.893
Something that my kids
would have to be responsible

00:01:50.917 --> 00:01:52.684
to pass through generations.

00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:53.976
I said, "Wait a minute,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.643
The Dean Collection is not just
for The Dean Collection,

00:01:56.667 --> 00:01:58.476
The Dean Collection is for everyone."

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.976
There are some galleries now
and places you walk in,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.268
if you don't have 50,000,
there's nothing to talk about.

00:02:04.292 --> 00:02:08.184
And I felt that a lot of people
were using that as an excuse

00:02:08.208 --> 00:02:09.476
to exit art.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.059
They feel that art
is only for rich people.

00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:13.351
Whoa.

00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:15.559
We've got to stop this,
we've got to fix this.

00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:17.809
And that's what made me and my wife say,

00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:21.309
you know, we have to create an entry point
to the younger generation

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:23.184
that didn't understand the art world,

00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:24.934
didn't have their seat at the table,

00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.184
and then we started "No Commissions."

00:02:27.208 --> 00:02:28.476
It's a big event,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.476
you got 30-something-thousand
RSVPs a night.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.434
The drinks are free, the food is free,

00:02:33.458 --> 00:02:34.917
the concert's free.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.143
The education is free,

00:02:37.167 --> 00:02:40.059
and I feel that education should be free.

00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:43.434
We went to Shanghai, we went to London,

00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:45.018
we went to Berlin,

00:02:45.042 --> 00:02:48.226
we did it right in my backyard
in the South Bronx.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.934
You can come in to "No Commissions"

00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:52.893
and get something for a couple of bucks,

00:02:52.917 --> 00:02:54.976
or a couple hundred thousand.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.684
There's a tier for every person
that has love for art.

00:02:58.708 --> 00:03:01.893
And what we're doing is something
totally different from a gallery.

00:03:01.917 --> 00:03:05.059
The artists keep 100 percent of the sales.

00:03:05.083 --> 00:03:06.934
But what about after "No Commissions,"

00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:10.726
how can you sustain,
how can you move forward

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.018
without having to be trapped
to sell your soul?

00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:16.893
I was a part of the sale with my brother
Sean "Diddy" Combs,

00:03:16.917 --> 00:03:18.559
the 21-million-dollar purchase,

00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:20.559
which made Kerry James Marshall

00:03:20.583 --> 00:03:25.351
the highest-selling African American
living artist to today.

00:03:25.375 --> 00:03:27.393
I'm like, "Man,
you just broke the record,"

00:03:27.417 --> 00:03:28.726
and the artist was like,

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.351
"Yeah, I don't know whether
to be happy or to be sad."

00:03:31.375 --> 00:03:35.101
He first sold that work,
it was under 100,000.

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:39.226
So imagine a work that you made
for under 100,000

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.351
is now being sold for 21 million,

00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:45.809
and you had to sit home and watch this.

00:03:45.833 --> 00:03:48.768
And you couldn't even
participate five percent.

00:03:48.792 --> 00:03:50.143
When you look at it,

00:03:50.167 --> 00:03:53.059
I'm a producer, I'm a songwriter,

00:03:53.083 --> 00:03:55.226
every time it's played on the radio,

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.684
I get paid.

00:03:56.708 --> 00:03:59.726
Every time it's played in a movie,

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.018
I get paid.

00:04:01.042 --> 00:04:05.684
Every time it plays, period,

00:04:05.708 --> 00:04:06.976
I get paid.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.143
Visual artists, they only get paid once.

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:14.476
How, when paintings are sold
and traded multiple times?

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.893
And that's that artist's lifetime work,

00:04:16.917 --> 00:04:19.309
that other people are making 10, 15,

00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:23.976
sometimes 100 times more
than the artist that created it.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.684
So I created something
called the Dean's Choice,

00:04:27.708 --> 00:04:30.934
where if you're a seller,

00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.559
or a collector,

00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:35.768
and you bring in your work
into, let's say, Sotheby's,

00:04:35.792 --> 00:04:38.684
there's a paper that's there
that says, "Hey, guys, you know,

00:04:38.708 --> 00:04:40.684
this artist is still living.

00:04:40.708 --> 00:04:44.351
You've made 300 percent on your investment

00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:46.726
by working with this artist.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.101
You can choose to give the artist
whatever you want of the sale."

00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:52.684
I think that even if five people did it,

00:04:52.708 --> 00:04:55.018
it'll start to change
everything in the arts.

00:04:55.042 --> 00:04:56.976
And this is happening in Europe already.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.893
It happens in the music industry,

00:04:58.917 --> 00:05:00.226
it's called publishing.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.143
And artists are able to survive,

00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:04.351
musicians are able to survive,

00:05:04.375 --> 00:05:05.643
years after years,

00:05:05.667 --> 00:05:08.268
off of the residual income
of their publishing.

00:05:08.292 --> 00:05:14.059
So how can we take something
that brings creatives together,

00:05:14.083 --> 00:05:15.518
and celebrate each other?

00:05:15.542 --> 00:05:18.018
Myself and Timbaland
have been working on this idea

00:05:18.042 --> 00:05:22.059
called Verzuz for about three years now.

00:05:22.083 --> 00:05:23.434
Then this trying time came,

00:05:23.458 --> 00:05:25.934
and everybody started
going to social media

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:27.268
to express themselves.

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:32.768
So what we did was I played my top songs,

00:05:32.792 --> 00:05:35.268
he played his top songs,

00:05:35.292 --> 00:05:37.018
and we went on Instagram Live.

00:05:37.042 --> 00:05:38.684
(Video) (Laughter)

00:05:38.708 --> 00:05:39.976
Timbaland: You having fun?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.671
This is so good for the culture.

00:05:41.705 --> 00:05:43.923
SB: A lot of people like to say "battle,"

00:05:43.927 --> 00:05:45.893
we pulled back off of that word "battle,"

00:05:45.917 --> 00:05:48.226
because we're battling enough
in the world today.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.976
We call it educational celebration.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.393
I think we're on our ninth or tenth one.

00:05:52.417 --> 00:05:55.500
Me and Timbaland started out
with 20,000 people.

00:05:56.333 --> 00:06:03.226
As of yesterday,
750,000 people in one room.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.708
So, we have this thing
called the "Verzuz Effect."

00:06:07.792 --> 00:06:10.893
And the "Verzuz Effect"
is what happens to the artist

00:06:10.917 --> 00:06:14.601
after they contribute to Verzuz.

00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:17.268
We can go to the Babyface
and Teddy Riley.

00:06:17.292 --> 00:06:19.625
They both went up millions of views.

00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:23.851
Both of their songs reentered the charts.

00:06:23.875 --> 00:06:27.934
And then we look
at the first ladies Verzuz,

00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:30.184
and both Erykah Badu and Jill Scott

00:06:30.208 --> 00:06:34.684
have seven positions in the top 20 charts.

00:06:34.708 --> 00:06:36.226
This is the Verzuz Effect.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.018
You know, billions and billions
and billions of impressions.

00:06:40.042 --> 00:06:42.143
This is something I've never seen before.

00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:46.934
And I felt that these artists
are getting their flowers today,

00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:49.684
which is a great thing,
while they can smell them.

00:06:49.708 --> 00:06:50.976
This was personal for me,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.851
because many a times
I've been counted out,

00:06:53.875 --> 00:06:56.143
I've been hot and cold 100 times.

00:06:56.167 --> 00:07:00.393
You still have to understand
the business as an artist,

00:07:00.417 --> 00:07:04.851
to elevate to your level
that you deserve to be.

00:07:04.875 --> 00:07:08.434
Because most creatives,
we're very emotional,

00:07:08.458 --> 00:07:12.851
we're very "let somebody else handle that,
I want to stick to this."

00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:16.559
But not only creativity is key,
education is key,

00:07:16.583 --> 00:07:18.684
which is the reason
why I went back to school

00:07:18.708 --> 00:07:22.143
to sharpen my pencil in my mid-30s.

00:07:22.167 --> 00:07:24.059
We have to know our business.

00:07:24.083 --> 00:07:28.101
But it's going to take us
digging in a little deeper

00:07:28.125 --> 00:07:31.143
and pulling out the knowledge
that we need to prepare ourselves

00:07:31.167 --> 00:07:34.309
for this world that's waiting
to take advantage of the creatives.

00:07:34.333 --> 00:07:35.857
Then we can make better choices,

00:07:35.881 --> 00:07:39.768
then we can end that conversation
of artists dying poor.

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:41.364
If we're not protecting the arts,

00:07:41.388 --> 00:07:43.184
we're not protecting our future,

00:07:43.208 --> 00:07:45.268
we're not protecting this world.

00:07:45.292 --> 00:07:46.875
Creativity heals us.

00:07:48.625 --> 00:07:51.476
What's these shades closing for?

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.059
Time out.

00:07:53.083 --> 00:07:54.333
(Scoffs)

00:07:55.167 --> 00:07:57.118
Voice: I kind of like that.
That was cool.

00:07:57.122 --> 00:07:58.372
SB: (Laughs)
