00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.628
Consider throwing a ball
straight into the air.

00:00:10.628 --> 00:00:13.852
Can you predict the motion
of the ball after it leaves your hand?

00:00:13.852 --> 00:00:15.176
Sure, that's easy.

00:00:15.176 --> 00:00:18.730
The ball will move upward
until it gets to some highest point,

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.668
then it will come back down
and land in your hand again.

00:00:21.668 --> 00:00:23.386
Of course, that's what happens,

00:00:23.386 --> 00:00:26.765
and you know this because you have
witnessed events like this countless times.

00:00:26.765 --> 00:00:31.417
You've been observing the physics
of everyday phenomena your entire life.

00:00:31.417 --> 00:00:35.884
But suppose we explore a question
about the physics of atoms,

00:00:35.884 --> 00:00:37.950
like what does the motion of an electron

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.906
around the nucleus of a 
hydrogen atom look like?

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:45.045
Could we answer that question based on
our experience with everyday physics?

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.872
Definietly not. Why?

00:00:46.872 --> 00:00:51.474
Because the physics that governs the
behavior of systems at such small scales

00:00:51.474 --> 00:00:55.224
is much different than the physics
of the macroscopic objects

00:00:55.224 --> 00:00:57.690
you see around you all the time.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.703
The everyday world you know and love

00:00:59.703 --> 00:01:03.702
behaves according to the laws 
of classical mechanics.

00:01:03.702 --> 00:01:05.880
But systems on the scale of atoms

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.870
behave according to the laws 
of quantum mechanics.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.432
This quantum world turns out to be
a very strange place.

00:01:13.432 --> 00:01:17.932
An illustration of quantum strangeness
is given by a famous thought experiment:

00:01:17.932 --> 00:01:20.090
Schrödinger's cat.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.449
A physicist, who doesn't particularly 
like cats, puts a cat in a box,

00:01:24.449 --> 00:01:30.148
along with a bomb that has a 50% chance
of blowing up after the lid is closed.

00:01:30.148 --> 00:01:32.756
Until we reopen the lid,
there is no way of knowing

00:01:32.756 --> 00:01:35.281
whether the bomb exploded or not,

00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:40.531
and thus, no way of knowing
if the cat is alive or dead.

00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:43.834
In quantum physics,
we could say that before our observation

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:46.606
the cat was in a superposition state.

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:51.656
It was neither alive nor dead but
rather in a mixture of both possibilities,

00:01:51.656 --> 00:01:54.678
with a 50% chance for each.

00:01:54.678 --> 00:01:58.842
The same sort of thing happens
to physical systems at quantum scales,

00:01:58.842 --> 00:02:01.611
like an electron orbiting
in a hydrogen atom.

00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:04.186
The electron isn't really orbiting at all.

00:02:04.186 --> 00:02:07.144
It's sort of everywhere in space,
all at once,

00:02:07.144 --> 00:02:10.920
with more of a probability of being
at some places than others,

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.000
and it's only after 
we measure its position

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.876
that we can pinpoint where it is
at that moment.

00:02:15.876 --> 00:02:18.971
A lot like how we didn't know
whether the cat was alive or dead

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:20.831
until we opened the box.

00:02:20.831 --> 00:02:23.576
This brings us to the strange
and beautiful phenomenon

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:25.871
of quantum entanglement.

00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:31.157
Suppose that instead of one cat in a box,
we have two cats in two different boxes.

00:02:31.157 --> 00:02:34.820
If we repeat the Schrödinger's cat experiment
with this pair of cats,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.780
the outcome of the experiment
can be one of four possibilities.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.869
Either both cats will be alive,
or both will be dead,

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:45.700
or one will be alive 
and the other dead, or vice versa.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.117
The system of both cats
is again in a superposition state,

00:02:49.117 --> 00:02:53.644
with each outcome having a 25% chance
rather than 50%.

00:02:53.644 --> 00:02:55.897
But here's the cool thing:

00:02:55.897 --> 00:02:58.508
quantum mechanics tells us
it's possible to erase

00:02:58.508 --> 00:03:03.984
the both cats alive and both cats dead
outcomes from the superposition state.

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:06.819
In other words,
there can be a two cat system,

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:12.502
such that the outcome will always be
one cat alive and the other cat dead.

00:03:12.502 --> 00:03:17.395
The technical term for this is that the
states of the cats are entangled.

00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:21.022
But there's something truly mindblowing
about quantum entanglement.

00:03:21.022 --> 00:03:25.011
If you prepare the system of two cats
in boxes in this entangled state,

00:03:25.011 --> 00:03:28.957
then move the boxes to opposite 
ends of the universe,

00:03:28.957 --> 00:03:32.752
the outcome of the experiment
will still always be the same.

00:03:32.752 --> 00:03:37.617
One cat will always come out alive,
and the other cat will always end up dead,

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:42.221
even though which particular cat
lives or dies is completely undetermined

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:44.609
before we measure the outcome.

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.196
How is this possible?

00:03:46.196 --> 00:03:49.647
How is it that the states of cats
on opposite sides of the universe

00:03:49.647 --> 00:03:51.822
can be entangled in this way?

00:03:51.822 --> 00:03:54.325
They're too far away to communicate
with each other in time,

00:03:54.325 --> 00:03:57.526
so how do the two bombs always 
conspire such that

00:03:57.526 --> 00:04:00.350
one blows up and the other doesn't?

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.496
You might be thinking,

00:04:01.496 --> 00:04:03.806
"This is just some theoretical
mumbo jumbo.

00:04:03.806 --> 00:04:06.388
This sort of thing can't happen
in the real world."

00:04:06.388 --> 00:04:08.923
But it turns out that quantum entanglement

00:04:08.923 --> 00:04:12.157
has been confirmed in 
real world lab experiments.

00:04:12.157 --> 00:04:15.794
Two subatomic particles entangled
in a superposition state,

00:04:15.794 --> 00:04:19.663
where if one spins one way
then the other must spin the other way,

00:04:19.663 --> 00:04:22.450
will do just that,
even when there's no way

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.986
for information to pass
from one particle to the other

00:04:25.986 --> 00:04:30.007
indicating which way to spin
to obey the rules of entanglement.

00:04:30.007 --> 00:04:32.960
It's not surprising then that
entanglement is at the core

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.301
of quantum information science,

00:04:35.301 --> 00:04:39.486
a growing field studying how to use
the laws of the strange quantum world

00:04:39.486 --> 00:04:41.549
in our macroscopic world,

00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:46.372
like in quantum cryptography, so spies
can send secure messages to each other,

00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:49.479
or quantum computing,
for cracking secret codes.

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.743
Everyday physics may start to look
a bit more like the strange quantum world.

00:04:53.743 --> 00:04:56.992
Quantum teleportation 
may even progress so far,

00:04:56.992 --> 00:05:00.323
that one day your cat will 
escape to a safer galaxy,

00:05:00.323 --> 00:05:03.169
where there are no physicists
and no boxes.
