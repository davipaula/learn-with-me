00:00:14.218 --> 00:00:18.376
Myths and misconceptions about evolution.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.761
Let's talk about evolution.

00:00:20.785 --> 00:00:21.462
You've probably heard

00:00:21.486 --> 00:00:23.534
that some people consider
it controversial,

00:00:23.558 --> 00:00:26.090
even though most scientists don't.

00:00:26.114 --> 00:00:27.693
But even if you aren't one of those people

00:00:27.717 --> 00:00:30.765
and you think you have a pretty
good understanding of evolution,

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.170
chances are you still believe
some things about it

00:00:33.194 --> 00:00:35.194
that aren't entirely right,

00:00:35.218 --> 00:00:36.603
things like,

00:00:36.627 --> 00:00:41.377
"Evolution is organisms
adapting to their environment."

00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:42.464
This was an earlier,

00:00:42.488 --> 00:00:43.671
now discredited,

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:45.533
theory of evolution.

00:00:45.557 --> 00:00:48.968
Almost 60 years before Darwin
published his book,

00:00:48.992 --> 00:00:50.523
Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed

00:00:50.547 --> 00:00:52.346
that creatures evolve by developing

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.771
certain traits over their lifetimes

00:00:54.795 --> 00:00:57.881
and then passing those
on to their offspring.

00:00:57.905 --> 00:00:59.778
For example, he thought

00:00:59.802 --> 00:01:01.727
that because giraffes spent their lives

00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:05.114
stretching to reach leaves
on higher branches,

00:01:05.138 --> 00:01:07.887
their children would be
born with longer necks.

00:01:07.911 --> 00:01:11.527
But we know now that's not
how genetic inheritance works.

00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:15.912
In fact, individual organisms
don't evolve at all.

00:01:15.936 --> 00:01:18.858
Instead, random genetic mutations cause

00:01:18.882 --> 00:01:21.667
some giraffes to be
born with longer necks,

00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:23.905
and that gives them
a better chance to survive

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.038
than the ones who weren't so lucky,

00:01:26.062 --> 00:01:27.990
which brings us to

00:01:28.014 --> 00:01:31.034
"survival of the fittest".

00:01:31.058 --> 00:01:34.282
This makes it sound
like evolution always favors

00:01:34.306 --> 00:01:35.198
the biggest,

00:01:35.222 --> 00:01:36.245
strongest,

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:37.580
or fastest creatures,

00:01:37.604 --> 00:01:39.642
which is not really the case.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:43.279
For one thing, evolutionary
fitness is just a matter

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:46.939
of how well-suited
they are to their current environment.

00:01:46.963 --> 00:01:48.821
If all the tall trees suddenly died out

00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:50.721
and only short grass was left,

00:01:50.745 --> 00:01:52.340
all those long-necked giraffes

00:01:52.364 --> 00:01:54.641
would be at a disadvantage.

00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:58.730
Secondly, survival is not
how evolution occurs,

00:01:58.754 --> 00:02:00.821
reproduction is.

00:02:00.845 --> 00:02:02.465
And the world if full of creatures

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.241
like the male anglerfish,

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:07.119
which is so small and ill-suited
for survival at birth

00:02:07.143 --> 00:02:10.783
that it has to quickly find
a mate before it dies.

00:02:10.807 --> 00:02:11.733
But at least we can say

00:02:11.757 --> 00:02:14.034
that if an organism dies
without reproducing,

00:02:14.058 --> 00:02:16.670
it's evolutionarily useless, right?

00:02:16.694 --> 00:02:17.918
Wrong!

00:02:17.942 --> 00:02:20.081
Remember, natural selection happens

00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:21.748
not at the organism level,

00:02:21.772 --> 00:02:23.200
but at the genetic level,

00:02:23.224 --> 00:02:25.657
and the same gene
that exists in one organism

00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:28.003
will also exist in its relatives.

00:02:28.027 --> 00:02:31.411
So, a gene that makes an animal
altruistically sacrifice itself

00:02:31.435 --> 00:02:34.261
to help the survival
and future reproduction

00:02:34.285 --> 00:02:35.793
of its siblings or cousins,

00:02:35.817 --> 00:02:37.303
can become more widespread

00:02:37.327 --> 00:02:40.929
than one that is solely concerned
with self-preservation.

00:02:40.953 --> 00:02:43.205
Anything that lets more copies of the gene

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:44.658
pass on to the next generation

00:02:44.682 --> 00:02:47.223
will serve its purpose,

00:02:47.247 --> 00:02:49.005
except

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:51.613
evolutionary purpose.

00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:55.231
One of the most difficult things
to keep in mind about evolution

00:02:55.255 --> 00:02:57.086
is that when we say things like,

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.527
"Genes want to make more
copies of themselves,"

00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:01.394
or even,

00:03:01.418 --> 00:03:03.386
"natural selection,"

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.011
we're actually using metaphors.

00:03:06.035 --> 00:03:08.474
A gene doesn't want anything,

00:03:08.498 --> 00:03:10.192
and there's no outside mechanism

00:03:10.216 --> 00:03:14.096
that selects which genes
are best to preserve.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.955
All that happens is that random
genetic mutations

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:18.650
cause the organisms carrying them

00:03:18.674 --> 00:03:20.777
to behave or develop in different ways.

00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:22.736
Some of those ways result in more copies

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.691
of the mutated gene being passed on,

00:03:24.715 --> 00:03:25.741
and so forth.

00:03:25.765 --> 00:03:27.432
Nor is there any predetermined plan

00:03:27.456 --> 00:03:30.871
progressing towards an ideal form.

00:03:30.895 --> 00:03:33.419
It's not ideal for the human
eye to have a blind spot

00:03:33.443 --> 00:03:35.321
where the optic nerve exits the retina,

00:03:35.345 --> 00:03:37.496
but that's how it developed,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.298
starting from a simple photoreceptor cell.

00:03:40.322 --> 00:03:41.894
In retrospect, it would have been

00:03:41.918 --> 00:03:43.918
much more advantageous for humans to crave

00:03:43.942 --> 00:03:45.176
nutrients and vitamins

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.188
rather than just calories.

00:03:47.212 --> 00:03:48.310
But over the millenia,

00:03:48.334 --> 00:03:50.001
during which our ancestors evolved,

00:03:50.025 --> 00:03:51.423
calories were scarce,

00:03:51.447 --> 00:03:53.114
and there was nothing to anticipate

00:03:53.138 --> 00:03:56.080
that this would later change so quickly.

00:03:56.104 --> 00:03:58.706
So, evolution proceeds blindly,

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.863
step

00:03:59.887 --> 00:04:01.504
by step

00:04:01.528 --> 00:04:03.213
by step,

00:04:03.237 --> 00:04:06.729
creating all of the diversity
we see in the natural world.
