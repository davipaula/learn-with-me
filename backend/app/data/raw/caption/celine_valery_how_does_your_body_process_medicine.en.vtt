00:00:07.054 --> 00:00:10.208
Have you ever wondered what
happens to a painkiller, like ibuprofen,

00:00:10.208 --> 00:00:11.964
after you swallow it?

00:00:11.964 --> 00:00:14.972
Medicine that slides down
your throat can help treat a headache,

00:00:14.972 --> 00:00:16.054
a sore back,

00:00:16.054 --> 00:00:17.934
or a throbbing sprained ankle.

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:20.833
But how does it get where it needs
to go in the first place?

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:24.715
The answer is that it hitches
a ride in your circulatory blood stream,

00:00:24.715 --> 00:00:27.445
cycling through your body in a race
to do its job

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:31.145
before it's snared by organs
and molecules designed to neutralize

00:00:31.145 --> 00:00:33.926
and expel foreign substances.

00:00:33.926 --> 00:00:36.605
This process starts 
in your digestive system.

00:00:36.605 --> 00:00:40.845
Say you swallow an ibuprofen tablet
for a sore ankle.

00:00:40.845 --> 00:00:44.125
Within minutes, the tablet starts
disintegrating in the acidic fluids

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:45.736
of your stomach.

00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:48.552
The dissolved ibuprofen travels
into the small intestine

00:00:48.552 --> 00:00:53.276
and then across the intestinal wall
into a network of blood vessels.

00:00:53.276 --> 00:00:56.005
These blood vessels feed into a vein,

00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:59.845
which carries the blood,
and anything in it, to the liver.

00:00:59.845 --> 00:01:02.526
The next step is to make 
it through the liver.

00:01:02.526 --> 00:01:07.775
As the blood and the drug molecules
in it travel through liver blood vessels,

00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:11.195
enzymes attempt to react with 
the ibuprofen molecules

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:13.305
to neutralize them.

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:16.769
The damaged ibuprofen molecules,
called metabolites,

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:19.837
may no longer be effective as painkillers.

00:01:19.837 --> 00:01:24.396
At this stage, most of the ibuprofen
makes it through the liver unscathed.

00:01:24.396 --> 00:01:26.527
It continues its journey out of the liver,

00:01:26.527 --> 00:01:27.766
through veins,

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:30.206
into the body's circulatory system.

00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:32.176
Half an hour after you swallow the pill,

00:01:32.176 --> 00:01:36.987
some of the dose has already made it
into the circulatory blood stream.

00:01:36.987 --> 00:01:39.698
This blood loop travels through every
limb and organ,

00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:44.674
including the heart, brain, kidneys,
and back through the liver.

00:01:44.674 --> 00:01:47.218
When ibuprofen molecules 
encounter a location

00:01:47.218 --> 00:01:50.084
where the body's pain 
response is in full swing,

00:01:50.084 --> 00:01:54.611
they bind to specific target molecules
that are a part of that reaction.

00:01:54.611 --> 00:01:57.681
Painkillers, like ibuprofen, block the
production of compounds

00:01:57.681 --> 00:02:00.859
that help the body transmit pain signals.

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:02.758
As more drug molecules accumulate,

00:02:02.758 --> 00:02:05.388
the pain-cancelling affect increases,

00:02:05.388 --> 00:02:09.084
reaching a maximum within about
one or two hours.

00:02:09.084 --> 00:02:11.948
Then the body starts efficiently 
eliminating ibuprofen,

00:02:11.948 --> 00:02:16.299
with the blood dose decreasing by half
every two hours on average.

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.238
When the ibuprofen molecules detach
from their targets,

00:02:19.238 --> 00:02:22.828
the systemic blood stream carries
them away again.

00:02:22.828 --> 00:02:26.412
Back in the liver, another small fraction
of the total amount of the drug

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:29.169
gets transformed into metabolites,

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.728
which are eventually filtered out
by the kidneys in the urine.

00:02:32.728 --> 00:02:35.530
The loop from liver to body to kidneys
continues at a rate

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.220
of about one blood cycle per minute,

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.398
with a little more of the drug neutralized
and filtered out in each cycle.

00:02:42.398 --> 00:02:45.570
These basic steps are the same for
any drug that you take orally,

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.119
but the speed of the process

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:50.086
and the amount of medicine that makes
it into your blood stream

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:51.538
varies based on drug,

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:52.456
person,

00:02:52.456 --> 00:02:54.709
and how it gets into the body.

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.320
The dosing instructions 
on medicine labels can help,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.109
but they're averages based on 
a sample population

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.933
that doesn't represent every consumer.

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:05.201
And getting the dose right is important.

00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:07.989
If it's too low, 
the medicine won't do its job.

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.210
If it's too high, the drug 
and its metabolites can be toxic.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.151
That's true of any drug.

00:03:14.151 --> 00:03:18.350
One of the hardest groups of patients
to get the right dosage for are children.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.930
That's because how they process medicine
changes quickly, as do their bodies.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.629
For instance, the level of liver enzymes
that neutralize medication

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:29.781
highly fluctuates 
during infancy and childhood.

00:03:29.781 --> 00:03:32.590
And that's just one 
of many complicating factors.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.461
Genetics,

00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:34.201
age,

00:03:34.201 --> 00:03:34.941
diet,

00:03:34.941 --> 00:03:35.685
disease,

00:03:35.685 --> 00:03:40.700
and even pregnancy influence the body's
efficiency of processing medicine.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.841
Some day, routine DNA tests may be able
to dial in the precise dose of medicine

00:03:45.841 --> 00:03:49.570
personalized to your liver efficiency
and other factors,

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.702
but in the meantime,

00:03:50.702 --> 00:03:52.341
your best bet is reading the label

00:03:52.341 --> 00:03:54.263
or consulting your doctor
or pharmacist,

00:03:54.263 --> 00:03:57.922
and taking the recommended amounts
with the recommended timing.
