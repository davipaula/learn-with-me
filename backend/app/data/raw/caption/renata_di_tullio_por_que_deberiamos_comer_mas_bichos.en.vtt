00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.834
I'm passionate about insects
for two reasons.

00:00:14.364 --> 00:00:18.568
For one, I'm mad about
the infinite diversity

00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:20.288
of this kind of little beings.

00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:24.469
30 million; not of insects but of species.

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:29.710
We say that humans invented the wheel.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.298
But dung beetles would move
balls of dung way before

00:00:34.298 --> 00:00:37.578
we would even think of 
standing up straight.

00:00:38.768 --> 00:00:41.743
"Humans invented compost."

00:00:41.743 --> 00:00:43.968
Ants would make compost

00:00:43.968 --> 00:00:47.835
long before any ecologist would
in their balcony.

00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:51.196
And just in case you used to think

00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:53.802
that we have invented air conditioning

00:00:54.302 --> 00:00:56.608
you are absolutely wrong.

00:00:56.808 --> 00:00:59.326
Of course, termites did it before.

00:01:00.376 --> 00:01:03.359
And there are bugs 
that serve as thermometers.

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:10.747
Here you are: the crickets.

00:01:12.837 --> 00:01:16.459
The more they crick, the higher
the ambient temperature.

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.806
It obviously varies with the species,
but it's quite accurate.

00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:25.768
And these are just some facts
about four insects.

00:01:26.198 --> 00:01:31.077
Figure this multiplied by 30 million!

00:01:32.707 --> 00:01:34.068
Incredible!

00:01:34.068 --> 00:01:35.328
(Laughter)

00:01:36.048 --> 00:01:40.658
Besides, insects are delicious.

00:01:40.658 --> 00:01:41.898
(Laughter)

00:01:42.138 --> 00:01:45.119
And this is the second thing
I wanted to talk to you about.

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:54.549
(Applause)

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:58.381
When I was 11 years old,
I was eating a hamburger

00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:00.303
at a fast food restaurant

00:02:00.303 --> 00:02:03.298
when a kid approaches me and says:

00:02:03.298 --> 00:02:07.450
"Do you know that hamburgers
are made of insects?"

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.087
Hold on for a second! Are insects edible?

00:02:12.087 --> 00:02:14.966
I later found out that
the hamburgers thing was a myth

00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:19.416
but at the time it kept me wondering
and I started searching.

00:02:19.416 --> 00:02:23.145
And in effect, not only insects are edible

00:02:23.145 --> 00:02:27.956
but they have a lot of advantages to them.

00:02:28.926 --> 00:02:33.048
Compared specially with agriculture
and the livestock industry,

00:02:33.048 --> 00:02:37.696
they create more food in less space
and using less natural resources.

00:02:38.826 --> 00:02:44.145
A grass-fed cow needs, give or take
one hectare to move.

00:02:44.595 --> 00:02:49.027
Whereas insects don't need more place
than what they already take.

00:02:49.807 --> 00:02:54.790
Now, if you feed that cow 8 kg of food,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.364
it will generate 1 kg of meat;
approximately an 8-to-1 ratio.

00:03:02.354 --> 00:03:06.849
If I feed the 8 kg of food to insects

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.808
they will generate 4 kg: a 8-to-4 ratio.

00:03:11.028 --> 00:03:16.819
Besides, insects in general have
more protein per 100 g than cows.

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:21.718
For instance, crickets have 
22 percent more protein.

00:03:22.648 --> 00:03:26.669
And if this was not enough,
the livestock industry is responsible

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:31.088
for the release of 37 percent methane
due to human activities

00:03:31.088 --> 00:03:33.257
that contributes to the greenhouse effect.

00:03:33.257 --> 00:03:34.848
And, guess what?

00:03:34.848 --> 00:03:39.019
Insects create in between 
10 and 100 time less methane

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.577
than, say, pork.

00:03:42.987 --> 00:03:47.439
Great, well, but if insects are so cool

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:50.747
why don't we have them
in the market shelves?

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:58.296
Precisely, for the faces
I saw in most of you

00:03:58.296 --> 00:04:00.417
when I ate a cricket.

00:04:02.387 --> 00:04:05.665
We don't have it in mind here,

00:04:05.665 --> 00:04:10.216
but in the world today, 2 billion people

00:04:10.216 --> 00:04:12.819
eat insects on daily basis.

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.056
As Latinamericans we used to as well,
until not so long ago --

00:04:17.446 --> 00:04:22.976
Our pre-Columbian diet was made
of an important variety of insects:

00:04:22.976 --> 00:04:27.746
ant larvae, worms, crickets, etc.

00:04:28.706 --> 00:04:34.526
Until the Spaniards came in and put
the same face you just put.

00:04:35.826 --> 00:04:38.199
Probably, when you think about
eating an insect,

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.147
you will imagine yourselves
biting a cockroach like this

00:04:41.537 --> 00:04:45.136
or cutting with your knife
a tarantula this big,

00:04:46.026 --> 00:04:47.629
but you need not to worry.

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:50.686
A product that's becoming widespread

00:04:50.686 --> 00:04:52.974
is insect flour.

00:04:53.354 --> 00:04:56.168
It has all the benefits I mentioned before

00:04:56.168 --> 00:04:59.035
plus, you don't even realize
you are eating crickets

00:04:59.035 --> 00:05:00.607
in a slice of bread.

00:05:02.747 --> 00:05:08.304
So, how can we get the most of
what insects can give to us?

00:05:09.084 --> 00:05:12.926
In 2017, we went to Chile
with a group of friends.

00:05:13.286 --> 00:05:18.017
We attended the first Latinamerican
Summit for Young Leaders in Biotech.

00:05:18.617 --> 00:05:21.748
There we introduced and idea
I think it can work.

00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:27.879
We suggested creating insects to produce
food with added value

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:31.285
in urban areas as a way to solve
the problem of the lack of space

00:05:31.285 --> 00:05:33.298
and the cost of resources.

00:05:34.568 --> 00:05:40.859
We did this thinking that if we youngsters
don't tear down cultural barriers,

00:05:40.859 --> 00:05:42.797
nobody will do it.

00:05:42.797 --> 00:05:45.635
In fact, we are already doing this
regarding genders.

00:05:45.635 --> 00:05:47.541
And also in Latinamerica

00:05:47.541 --> 00:05:51.807
the production of food
is a neural part of our economy

00:05:51.807 --> 00:05:54.553
and we cannot stay behind
amidst these changes.

00:05:55.123 --> 00:05:58.598
And to do this it's not required
a huge warehouse

00:05:58.598 --> 00:06:00.719
or a big investment.

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:05.678
For instance, I try to contribute
in my own house

00:06:05.678 --> 00:06:09.797
breeding insects,
studying how to cook them

00:06:09.797 --> 00:06:12.792
and transform them
so they can be more edible.

00:06:13.532 --> 00:06:17.179
And if they look at insects beyond
our preconceptions?

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:22.467
What if we see them as thermometers,
or as great inventors,

00:06:22.467 --> 00:06:24.540
and also as food?

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.887
Nature provides with a solution that is
profitable, viable and sustainable.

00:06:30.887 --> 00:06:32.736
And it's even delicious!

00:06:34.386 --> 00:06:39.223
Let's grab this chance and try to change
the lens we look to insects with.

00:06:39.723 --> 00:06:41.466
(Applause)
