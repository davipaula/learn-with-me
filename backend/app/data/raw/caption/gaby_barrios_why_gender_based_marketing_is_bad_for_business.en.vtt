00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:15.518
Like a lot of people around the world,

00:00:15.542 --> 00:00:18.143
earlier this summer
my friends and I were obsessed

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:20.643
with the Women's World Cup held in France.

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:23.518
Here we are, watching
these incredible athletes,

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:27.101
the goals were amazing,
the games were clean and engaging,

00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:29.893
and at the same time, outside the field,

00:00:29.917 --> 00:00:31.893
these women are talking about equal pay,

00:00:31.917 --> 00:00:35.518
and in the case of some countries,
any pay at all for their sport.

00:00:35.542 --> 00:00:39.059
So because we were mildly obsessed,
we wanted to watch the games live,

00:00:39.083 --> 00:00:42.851
and we decided that one of
the Spanish-speaking networks in the US

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:44.893
was the best place for us to start.

00:00:44.917 --> 00:00:47.851
And it wasn't until a few games
into the tournament

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:50.393
that a friend of mine
talks to me and says,

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:52.559
"Why does it feel
like everything I'm seeing

00:00:52.583 --> 00:00:55.833
is commercials for makeup and
household cleaning products and diets?"

00:00:56.917 --> 00:00:58.768
It did feel a little bit too obvious,

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:01.018
and I don't know if
we were sensitive about it

00:01:01.042 --> 00:01:04.184
or the fact that we were watching
with men and boys in our lives,

00:01:04.208 --> 00:01:06.184
but it did feel a little bit too obvious

00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:09.226
that we're being targeted for being women.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.809
And to be honest there's nothing
necessarily wrong with that.

00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:16.018
Someone sat down and looked
at the tournament and said,

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:19.684
"Well, this thing is likely
to be seen by more women,

00:01:19.708 --> 00:01:22.601
these women are Hispanic
because they're watching in Spanish,

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:23.893
and this is women content.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:27.268
Therefore, this is a great place
for me to place all these commercials

00:01:27.292 --> 00:01:30.393
that are female-centric
and maybe not other things."

00:01:30.417 --> 00:01:32.101
If I think about it as a marketer,

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:34.768
I know that I absolutely
should not be annoyed about it,

00:01:34.792 --> 00:01:38.059
because this is what marketers
are tasked with doing.

00:01:38.083 --> 00:01:41.726
Marketers are tasked with building brands
with very limited budget,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.184
so there's a little bit of an incentive

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:46.184
to categorize people in buckets

00:01:46.208 --> 00:01:48.059
so they can reach their target faster.

00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:49.434
So if you think about this,

00:01:49.458 --> 00:01:50.934
it's kind of like a shortcut.

00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:54.167
They're using gender as a shortcut
to get to their target consumer.

00:01:55.292 --> 00:01:59.226
The issue is that as logical
as that argument seems,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.559
gender as a shortcut
is actually not great.

00:02:02.583 --> 00:02:05.809
In this day and age,
if you still blindly use a gender view

00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:07.393
for your marketing activities,

00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:09.542
actually it's just plain bad business.

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:13.893
I'm not talking even about the backlash
on stereotypes in advertising,

00:02:13.917 --> 00:02:17.101
which is a very real thing
that has to be addressed.

00:02:17.125 --> 00:02:20.434
I'm saying it's bad business because
you're leaving money on the table

00:02:20.458 --> 00:02:22.226
for your brands and your products.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.351
Because gender is such an easy thing
to find in the market

00:02:25.375 --> 00:02:27.268
and to target and to talk about,

00:02:27.292 --> 00:02:29.601
it actually distracts you
from the fun things

00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:31.851
that could be driving growth
from your brands

00:02:31.875 --> 00:02:33.184
and, at the same time,

00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:35.851
it continues to create
separation around genders

00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:37.643
and perpetuate stereotypes.

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:40.851
So at the same time
this activity is bad for your business

00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:43.125
and bad for society, so double whammy.

00:02:43.875 --> 00:02:47.393
And gender is one of those things
like other demographics

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:50.101
that have historically been
good marketing shortcuts.

00:02:50.125 --> 00:02:51.726
At some point, however,

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.226
we forgot that at the core
we were targeting needs

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.976
around cooking and cleaning
and personal care and driving and sports

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.726
and we just made it all a bucket

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.851
and we said, "Men and women
are different."

00:03:02.875 --> 00:03:05.476
We got used to it and
we never challenged it again,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.101
and it's fascinating to me,

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:09.851
and by fascinating I mean
a little bit insane,

00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:12.393
that we still talk about this as a segment

00:03:12.417 --> 00:03:15.601
when it's most likely carryover bias.

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:18.434
In fact, I don't come
to this conclusion lightly.

00:03:18.458 --> 00:03:22.226
We have enough data to suggest
that gender is not the best place

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.684
to start for you to design
and target your brands.

00:03:25.708 --> 00:03:27.726
And I would even go one step further:

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.226
unless you are working in
a very gender-specific product category,

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.559
probably anything else

00:03:33.583 --> 00:03:36.143
you're hypothesizing
about your consumer right now

00:03:36.167 --> 00:03:38.083
is going to be more useful than gender.

00:03:39.917 --> 00:03:42.851
We did not set up to draw
this conclusion specifically.

00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:44.143
We found it.

00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:46.643
As consultants, our job
is to go with our clients

00:03:46.667 --> 00:03:48.143
and understand their business

00:03:48.167 --> 00:03:51.684
and try to help them find spaces
for their brands to grow.

00:03:51.708 --> 00:03:56.059
And it is our belief that if you want
to find disruptive growth in the market,

00:03:56.083 --> 00:03:57.851
you have to go to the consumer

00:03:57.875 --> 00:04:00.101
and take a very agnostic view
of the consumer.

00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:02.393
You have to go and look
at them from scratch,

00:04:02.417 --> 00:04:06.809
remove yourself from biases and segments
that you thought were important,

00:04:06.833 --> 00:04:09.809
just take a look to see
where the growth is.

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:12.768
And we built ourselves
an algorithm precisely for that.

00:04:12.792 --> 00:04:15.351
So imagine that we have a person

00:04:15.375 --> 00:04:17.643
and we know a person is making a choice

00:04:17.667 --> 00:04:19.601
about a product or service,

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:22.684
and from this person,
I can know their gender, of course,

00:04:22.708 --> 00:04:25.934
other demographics, where they live,
their income, other things.

00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:29.143
I know the context where
this person is making a decision,

00:04:29.167 --> 00:04:31.184
where they are, who they're with,

00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:33.018
the energy, anything,

00:04:33.042 --> 00:04:35.101
and I can also put
other things in the mix.

00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:36.476
I can know their attitudes,

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.143
how they feel about the category,

00:04:38.167 --> 00:04:39.559
their behaviors.

00:04:39.583 --> 00:04:44.184
So if you imagine this kind of blob
of big data about a person --

00:04:44.208 --> 00:04:46.268
I'm going to oversimplify the science here

00:04:46.292 --> 00:04:49.684
but we basically built an algorithm
for statistical tournaments.

00:04:49.708 --> 00:04:54.143
So a statistical tournament
is like asking this big thing of data,

00:04:54.167 --> 00:04:58.768
"So, data, from everything
you know about consumers at this point,

00:04:58.792 --> 00:05:01.476
what is the most
useful thing I need to know

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.518
that tells me more
about what consumers need?"

00:05:04.542 --> 00:05:07.101
So the tournament is going
to have winners and losers.

00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:09.518
The winners are those variables,
those dimensions,

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:11.893
that actually teach you a lot
about your consumer,

00:05:11.917 --> 00:05:14.184
that if you know that,
you know what they need.

00:05:14.208 --> 00:05:17.184
And there's losing variables
that are just not that practical,

00:05:17.208 --> 00:05:20.393
and this matters because
in a world of limited resources,

00:05:20.417 --> 00:05:23.809
you don't want to waste it on people
that actually have the same needs.

00:05:23.833 --> 00:05:25.893
So why treat them differently?

00:05:25.917 --> 00:05:28.518
So at this point, I know,
suspense is not killing you,

00:05:28.542 --> 00:05:30.434
because I told you what the output is,

00:05:30.458 --> 00:05:32.893
but what we found over time

00:05:32.917 --> 00:05:37.434
is after 200 projects around the world --
this is covering 20 countries or more --

00:05:37.458 --> 00:05:41.309
in essence we ran about
a hundred thousand of these tournaments,

00:05:41.333 --> 00:05:46.393
and, no surprise, gender was very rarely
the most predictive thing

00:05:46.417 --> 00:05:48.167
to understand consumer needs.

00:05:49.292 --> 00:05:51.184
From a hundred thousand tournaments,

00:05:51.208 --> 00:05:53.601
gender only came out
as the winning variable

00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:55.125
in about five percent of them.

00:05:55.958 --> 00:05:58.018
This is true around the world, by the way.

00:05:58.042 --> 00:06:00.559
We did this in places
where traditional gender roles

00:06:00.583 --> 00:06:02.934
are a little more pronounced,

00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:05.018
and the conclusions were exactly the same.

00:06:05.042 --> 00:06:07.976
It was a little bit more important,
gender, than five percent,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.268
but not material.

00:06:09.292 --> 00:06:11.476
So let's let that sink in for a second.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.851
No matter how you're looking
at a consumer,

00:06:13.875 --> 00:06:18.226
most likely anything else is going
to be more interesting to you than gender.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.643
There's probably something very important
you need to know about them,

00:06:21.667 --> 00:06:25.351
and you're getting distracted because
you're doing everything based on gender.

00:06:25.375 --> 00:06:27.976
And that's why I say you're leaving
money on the table.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.059
Gender is easy. It's easy to design
advertising based on gender,

00:06:31.083 --> 00:06:35.476
it's easy to target people online
and on TV based on gender.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.851
But at the end, that's not where
the exciting growth will come from.

00:06:38.875 --> 00:06:43.101
If you're a food company, for example,
it's actually much more interesting to you

00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:46.726
to know where people are eating,
who they are eating with,

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.184
are they very nutritionally oriented.

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:52.934
All of those things are actually
significantly more powerful and useful

00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:55.393
than knowing if a person
is a man or a woman.

00:06:55.417 --> 00:06:56.809
And that matters, of course,

00:06:56.833 --> 00:07:00.101
because then if you're putting
your limited budget into action,

00:07:00.125 --> 00:07:03.184
then you're better off creating
solutions for different occasions

00:07:03.208 --> 00:07:05.375
than trying to target women
versus young men.

00:07:06.917 --> 00:07:09.226
Another example is alcoholic beverages.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.601
Thirty-five percent to 40 percent
of consumption in alcoholic beverages

00:07:12.625 --> 00:07:14.768
around the world
actually happens with women,

00:07:14.792 --> 00:07:16.768
but, you know, "women don't drink beer."

00:07:16.792 --> 00:07:19.583
Those are the things
that we typically hear.

00:07:20.583 --> 00:07:24.601
But actually, when a man and a woman are,
for the most part, in the same location,

00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:27.559
the emotional and functional needs
they have at that moment

00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:29.143
are very similar.

00:07:29.167 --> 00:07:31.268
There's only one exception, by the way,

00:07:31.292 --> 00:07:33.059
and the exceptions exist,

00:07:33.083 --> 00:07:34.809
where if you have a man and a woman

00:07:34.833 --> 00:07:36.143
on a date,

00:07:36.167 --> 00:07:38.518
the man is trying to impress the woman

00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:40.851
and the woman is trying
to connect with the man,

00:07:40.875 --> 00:07:43.101
so there's going to be
a little bit of tension,

00:07:43.125 --> 00:07:44.601
but that's important to know.

00:07:44.625 --> 00:07:45.893
We'll take a few dates.

00:07:45.917 --> 00:07:48.976
Financial institutions:
that's something where we've heard a lot

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.059
about the difference
between men and women,

00:07:51.083 --> 00:07:53.601
but actually talking about
men and women as different

00:07:53.625 --> 00:07:56.226
is distracting you
from the thing that is underneath.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:59.476
We made it so simple
as "women don't like to invest,"

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.184
"women hate managing their money,"

00:08:01.208 --> 00:08:03.601
"men are great and aggressive
and risk-takers,"

00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:05.768
but at the end it's not
about men and women.

00:08:05.792 --> 00:08:07.601
It is actually a different narrative.

00:08:07.625 --> 00:08:10.893
It is about, there are people
that are excited and energized

00:08:10.917 --> 00:08:13.476
and educated to manage their finances

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.934
versus people that are not.

00:08:14.958 --> 00:08:16.684
So if you change the conversation

00:08:16.708 --> 00:08:19.518
from men and women
to actually what's underneath

00:08:19.542 --> 00:08:22.851
then probably you'll stop being
so condescending to women

00:08:22.875 --> 00:08:24.559
and you may start serving some men

00:08:24.583 --> 00:08:27.643
that are actually shy
about managing their finances.

00:08:27.667 --> 00:08:29.268
I'll leave one more example.

00:08:29.292 --> 00:08:32.476
If I go back to the women
that were playing sport at the beginning,

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.101
one of the fascinating things we found
over different countries,

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:38.434
exploring sportswear,

00:08:38.458 --> 00:08:40.518
that if a person is a competitive person

00:08:40.542 --> 00:08:42.768
and they are in the moment of action,

00:08:42.792 --> 00:08:45.393
the needs are not different
between a man and a woman.

00:08:45.417 --> 00:08:46.726
An athlete is an athlete.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:50.184
It doesn't matter for men and women,
it doesn't matter for old and young,

00:08:50.208 --> 00:08:51.476
you are an athlete,

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.976
and in the moment of action
and extreme competition,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.726
you need this gear to work for you.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.309
So these soccer-playing women have
a lot in common with their counterparts.

00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:01.143
Out of the field, it doesn't matter.

00:09:01.167 --> 00:09:04.101
Out of the field, they may be
into fashion, into other things,

00:09:04.125 --> 00:09:06.684
but on the field,
the needs are not different.

00:09:06.708 --> 00:09:10.434
So these are just a few examples
on categories where we found

00:09:10.458 --> 00:09:13.226
that gender was not the best place to go,

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.559
and actually the argument is

00:09:15.583 --> 00:09:17.934
that at this point
it's not even a feminist push,

00:09:17.958 --> 00:09:19.434
it's just we got used to it.

00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:20.851
We got used to using gender,

00:09:20.875 --> 00:09:24.018
and it's important for us
to start finding ways

00:09:24.042 --> 00:09:26.226
to measure other things about consumers

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.684
so that we don't revert back to gender.

00:09:28.708 --> 00:09:30.018
I am not naïve,

00:09:30.042 --> 00:09:32.226
and I know there's still
going to be appetite

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.101
and certain ease around using gender,

00:09:34.125 --> 00:09:36.184
but at least this warrants a conversation.

00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:38.101
In your business, you have to inquire,

00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:41.101
is this really the best lens
for me to grow.

00:09:41.125 --> 00:09:44.643
So, if you are, like me,
a person that is in business,

00:09:44.667 --> 00:09:48.643
that I am constantly worried
about what is my role

00:09:48.667 --> 00:09:51.726
in the broader societal discussions,

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.726
if you're listening to your business
and you hear things like,

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.893
"Oh, my target are women,
my target are men,

00:09:56.917 --> 00:09:59.601
this goes to young girls, young boys,"

00:09:59.625 --> 00:10:01.518
when it's that gender conversation,

00:10:01.542 --> 00:10:03.059
unless you are working, again,

00:10:03.083 --> 00:10:07.226
in a very specific,
gender-specific product category,

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.726
take this as a warning sign,

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.601
because if you keep
having these conversations,

00:10:11.625 --> 00:10:14.143
you will keep perpetuating
stereotypes of people

00:10:14.167 --> 00:10:16.851
and making people think
that men and women are different.

00:10:16.875 --> 00:10:19.684
But because this is business,
and we're running a business,

00:10:19.708 --> 00:10:21.018
and we want to grow it,

00:10:21.042 --> 00:10:23.851
at least kind of challenge
your own instinct to use gender,

00:10:23.875 --> 00:10:27.393
because statistics say that you're
probably not choosing the best variable

00:10:27.417 --> 00:10:29.309
to target your product or service.

00:10:29.333 --> 00:10:31.559
Growth is not easy at all.

00:10:31.583 --> 00:10:33.934
What makes you think
that growth is going to come

00:10:33.958 --> 00:10:37.351
from going into market
with such an outdated lens like gender?

00:10:37.375 --> 00:10:40.059
So let's stop doing what's easy
and go for what's right.

00:10:40.083 --> 00:10:43.601
At this point, it's not just
for your business, it's for society.

00:10:43.625 --> 00:10:45.018
Thank you.

00:10:45.042 --> 00:10:48.042
(Applause)
