00:00:12.706 --> 00:00:15.184
So if you live on planet Earth

00:00:15.208 --> 00:00:18.768
and you're one of seven billion people
that eats food every day,

00:00:18.792 --> 00:00:20.184
I need you to pay attention,

00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:22.351
because over the next three decades,

00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:23.809
we will need to address

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:27.809
one of the most critical
global challenges of our generation.

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:30.059
And I'm not talking about climate change.

00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:32.458
I'm talking about food and agriculture.

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:38.726
In 2050, our global population
is projected to reach 9.8 billion,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.643
with 68 percent of us
living in urban city centers.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:45.518
In order to feed this massive population,

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:47.934
we will need to increase
our agricultural output

00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:50.333
by 70 percent over current levels.

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:53.101
Just to put this number into perspective,

00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:56.518
we will need to grow more food
in the next 35 to 40 years

00:00:56.542 --> 00:01:00.309
than the previous 10,000 years combined.

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:04.309
Put simply, not only is our global
population becoming bigger,

00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.226
but it's also getting denser,

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.851
and we will need to grow
significantly more food

00:01:08.875 --> 00:01:11.750
using significantly less
land and resources.

00:01:13.042 --> 00:01:18.601
Complicating our current efforts
to address these major demographic shifts

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:21.667
are the challenges facing
the agricultural industry today.

00:01:22.917 --> 00:01:26.976
Globally, one third of all the food
that we produce is wasted,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.309
acquitting to 1.6 billion tons of food

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.684
that spoiled on the way to the market

00:01:32.708 --> 00:01:35.101
or expired in our refrigerators

00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:37.851
or were simply thrown out
by supermarkets and restaurants

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:39.559
at the end of the day.

00:01:39.583 --> 00:01:42.726
Every single year,
up to 600 million people

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.184
will get sick eating contaminated food,

00:01:45.208 --> 00:01:49.268
highlighting the challenge that we have
of maintaining global food safety.

00:01:49.292 --> 00:01:51.351
And, maybe unsurprisingly,

00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:53.018
the agricultural industry

00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:55.809
is the single largest
consumer of fresh water,

00:01:55.833 --> 00:01:58.708
accounting for 70 percent of global usage.

00:01:59.875 --> 00:02:02.018
Now, you'll be relieved to know

00:02:02.042 --> 00:02:04.351
that the agricultural industry

00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:09.601
and that the global movement
by universities, companies and NGOs

00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:11.643
is putting together comprehensive research

00:02:11.667 --> 00:02:13.559
and developing novel technology

00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:15.333
to address all of these issues.

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:18.518
And many have been doing it for decades.

00:02:18.542 --> 00:02:22.143
But one of the more recent
innovations in food production

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:25.726
being deployed in industrial parks
in North America,

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.976
in the urban city centers of Asia,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.393
and even in the arid deserts
of the Middle East

00:02:30.417 --> 00:02:32.292
is controlled environment agriculture.

00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:36.934
Controlled environment agriculture
is actually just a fancy way of saying

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:38.934
weather- or climate-proof farming,

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:42.809
and many of these farms grow food
three-dimensionally in vertical racks,

00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:46.184
as opposed to the two dimensions
of conventional farms.

00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:49.143
And so this type of food production
is also referred to

00:02:49.167 --> 00:02:51.125
as indoor vertical farming.

00:02:52.167 --> 00:02:54.809
I've been involved
in the indoor vertical farming space

00:02:54.833 --> 00:02:56.559
for the past five and a half years,

00:02:56.583 --> 00:02:59.351
developing technology
to make this type of food production

00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:01.476
more efficient and affordable.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.059
This picture was taken outside
of a decommissioned shipping container

00:03:05.083 --> 00:03:07.893
that we converted into an indoor farm

00:03:07.917 --> 00:03:11.333
and then launched into the heart
and the heat of Dubai.

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:15.643
Indoor vertical farming
is a relatively recent phenomena,

00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:16.934
commercially speaking,

00:03:16.958 --> 00:03:20.268
and the reason for this is that consumers
care more about food safety

00:03:20.292 --> 00:03:21.893
and where their food comes from,

00:03:21.917 --> 00:03:25.643
and also, the necessary technology
to make this possible

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:28.726
is more readily available and lower cost,

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.393
and the overall cost of food production
globally is actually increasing,

00:03:33.417 --> 00:03:35.934
making this type of food production
more competitive.

00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:39.018
So if you want to build
an indoor vertical farm,

00:03:39.042 --> 00:03:42.518
you will need to replace some of
the conventional elements of farming

00:03:42.542 --> 00:03:44.309
with artificial substitutes,

00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:46.083
starting with sunlight.

00:03:47.208 --> 00:03:48.851
In indoor vertical farms,

00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:52.476
natural sunlight is replaced
with artificial lighting like LEDs.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.601
While there are many different types
of LEDs being used,

00:03:55.625 --> 00:03:57.643
the one that we decided to install here

00:03:57.667 --> 00:03:59.851
is called "full spectrum LEDs,"

00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:03.476
which was optimized for the type
of vegetables that we were growing.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.309
Also, in order to maximize
production for a given space,

00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:11.434
indoor vertical farms also utilize
and install racking systems

00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:13.351
to grow vegetables vertically,

00:04:13.375 --> 00:04:15.101
and some of the biggest facilities

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:18.042
stack their production
14 to 16 floors high.

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:22.809
Now most of these farms are hydroponic
or aeroponic systems,

00:04:22.833 --> 00:04:24.768
which means that instead of using soil,

00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:28.351
they use a substitute material
like polyurethane sponges,

00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:30.184
biodegradable peat moss

00:04:30.208 --> 00:04:33.750
and even use inorganic materials
like perlite and clay pellets.

00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:37.101
Another unique aspects about these farms

00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:39.601
is that they use
a precise nutrient formula

00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:42.893
that is circulated and recycled
throughout the facility,

00:04:42.917 --> 00:04:45.601
and this is pumped directly
to the vegetables' root zone

00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:46.875
to promote plant growth.

00:04:47.917 --> 00:04:49.893
And lastly, these farms use

00:04:49.917 --> 00:04:52.643
a sophisticated monitoring
and automation system

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:55.101
to significantly increase productivity,

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:57.434
efficiency and consistency,

00:04:57.458 --> 00:04:59.934
and these tools also provide
the added benefit

00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:03.292
of producing food that is
more traceable and safe.

00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:08.226
Some of the obvious benefits
of growing food in this way

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.976
is that you have year-round
vegetable production,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.559
you have consistent quality
and you have predictable output.

00:05:14.583 --> 00:05:16.518
Some of the other major benefits

00:05:16.542 --> 00:05:20.059
include significant
resource use efficiencies,

00:05:20.083 --> 00:05:21.792
particularly water.

00:05:22.667 --> 00:05:25.393
For every kilogram of vegetables
grown in this way,

00:05:25.417 --> 00:05:30.059
hundreds of liters of water is conserved
compared to conventional farming methods.

00:05:30.083 --> 00:05:31.393
And with the water savings

00:05:31.417 --> 00:05:34.059
come similar savings
in the use of fertilizer.

00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:35.893
One of the highest-yielding farms

00:05:35.917 --> 00:05:41.375
grows over 350 times more food
per square meter than a conventional farm.

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:43.934
And weatherproofing

00:05:43.958 --> 00:05:47.809
means complete control
of incoming contaminants and pests,

00:05:47.833 --> 00:05:51.125
completely eliminating the need
for the use of chemical pesticides.

00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:53.809
And not to be mistaken,

00:05:53.833 --> 00:05:56.851
these farms can produce
enormous amounts of food,

00:05:56.875 --> 00:05:58.559
with one of the biggest facilities

00:05:58.583 --> 00:06:01.976
producing 30,000 heads
of vegetables a day.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.101
However, as with any
new technology or innovation,

00:06:05.125 --> 00:06:06.518
there are some drawbacks.

00:06:06.542 --> 00:06:07.809
As you would imagine,

00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:11.059
growing food in this way
can be incredibly energy-intensive.

00:06:11.083 --> 00:06:15.059
Also, these farms can only produce
a small variety of vegetables commercially

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:19.101
and the overall cost of the production
still is quite high.

00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:21.268
And in order to address these issues,

00:06:21.292 --> 00:06:24.268
some of the biggest
and most sophisticated farms

00:06:24.292 --> 00:06:28.000
are making significant investments,
starting with energy efficiency.

00:06:29.458 --> 00:06:32.393
In order to reduce the high energy usage,

00:06:32.417 --> 00:06:35.601
there are efforts to develop
higher-efficiency LEDs,

00:06:35.625 --> 00:06:38.476
to develop lasers
optimized for plant growth

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.643
and using even
fiber-optic cables like these

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:45.143
to channel sunlight directly
into an indoor vertical farm

00:06:45.167 --> 00:06:47.958
during the day to reduce the need
for artificial lighting.

00:06:49.208 --> 00:06:53.976
Also, to reduce the labor costs associated
with hiring a more sophisticated,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.351
more urban and also
more high-skilled labor force,

00:06:57.375 --> 00:07:01.292
robotics in automation is used extensively
in large-scale facilities.

00:07:02.583 --> 00:07:06.018
And you can never really be
too resource-efficient.

00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:10.226
Building indoor vertical farms
in and around urban city centers

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.101
can help to shorten
the agricultural supply chain

00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:16.476
and also help to maintain
the nutritional content in vegetables.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.309
Also, there are food deserts
in many countries

00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:24.101
that have little to no access
to nutritious vegetables,

00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:25.851
and as this industry matures,

00:07:25.875 --> 00:07:29.476
it will become possible
to provide more equitable access

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.434
to high-quality,
highly nutritious vegetables

00:07:32.458 --> 00:07:35.000
in even the most
underprivileged of communities.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.643
And finally, and this is
really exciting for me personally,

00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:43.351
indoor vertical farming
can actually be integrated seamlessly

00:07:43.375 --> 00:07:44.768
into the cityscape

00:07:44.792 --> 00:07:51.351
to help repurpose idle, underutilized
and unused urban infrastructure.

00:07:51.375 --> 00:07:53.375
In fact, this is already happening today.

00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:58.809
Ride-sharing services have taken
hundreds of thousands of cars off the road

00:07:58.833 --> 00:08:02.167
and they have significantly reduced
the need for parking.

00:08:02.833 --> 00:08:05.351
This is a farm that we installed
in central Beijing

00:08:05.375 --> 00:08:08.351
in an underutilized
underground parking structure

00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:11.000
to grow vegetables for the nearby hotels.

00:08:11.458 --> 00:08:12.851
Underutilized infrastructure

00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:16.559
is not simply limited
to large-scale civil engineering projects,

00:08:16.583 --> 00:08:20.292
and they can also include smaller spaces
like idle restaurant corners.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:23.393
This is an example
of a farm that we installed

00:08:23.417 --> 00:08:26.601
directly into the partition
of a hotel entrance

00:08:26.625 --> 00:08:30.083
in order to grow fresh herbs
and microgreens on-site for the chefs.

00:08:31.583 --> 00:08:33.351
Honestly, if you look around,

00:08:33.375 --> 00:08:36.143
you will find underutilized
space everywhere,

00:08:36.167 --> 00:08:39.917
under, around and inside
of urban developments.

00:08:40.542 --> 00:08:43.434
This is a farm that we installed
into an empty office corner

00:08:43.458 --> 00:08:46.542
to grow fresh vegetables
for the employees in nearby cafes.

00:08:48.167 --> 00:08:51.101
I get to be a part
of all these cool projects

00:08:51.125 --> 00:08:53.268
and working in the agricultural industry

00:08:53.292 --> 00:08:56.476
to improve access and affordability

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.309
to fresh and nutritious produce,

00:08:58.333 --> 00:09:00.684
hopefully soon by anyone anywhere,

00:09:00.708 --> 00:09:04.059
has been the greatest joy
and also the most humbling

00:09:04.083 --> 00:09:06.625
and intellectually challenging
thing I've ever done.

00:09:07.792 --> 00:09:11.851
And now that I've convinced you
that agriculture can be quite sexy,

00:09:11.875 --> 00:09:14.434
you'll be surprised and shocked to know

00:09:14.458 --> 00:09:16.684
that I still have trouble

00:09:16.708 --> 00:09:21.643
fully articulating how and why
I decided to work, and continue to work,

00:09:21.667 --> 00:09:23.643
in the agricultural industry.

00:09:23.667 --> 00:09:27.101
But a couple of years ago,
I found a rather unique answer

00:09:27.125 --> 00:09:29.143
hiding in plain sight.

00:09:29.167 --> 00:09:31.309
You see, I read an article

00:09:31.333 --> 00:09:33.351
about how your name,

00:09:33.375 --> 00:09:35.434
particularly your last name,

00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:36.768
can have a strong influence

00:09:36.792 --> 00:09:40.000
on everything from your personality
to your professional career.

00:09:40.667 --> 00:09:43.059
This is my Japanese last name:

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.809
Oda.

00:09:44.833 --> 00:09:47.708
And the characters translate literally

00:09:48.667 --> 00:09:49.934
into "small farm."

00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:51.226
(Laughter)

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:52.518
Thank you.

00:09:52.542 --> 00:09:55.792
(Applause)
