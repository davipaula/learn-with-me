00:00:13.028 --> 00:00:14.731
As you've probably noticed,

00:00:14.755 --> 00:00:17.932
in recent years, a lot
of western forests have burned

00:00:17.956 --> 00:00:21.568
in large and destructive wildfires.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.063
If you're like me --

00:00:24.087 --> 00:00:28.599
this western landscape
is actually why my family and I live here.

00:00:29.558 --> 00:00:31.848
And as a scientist and a father,

00:00:31.872 --> 00:00:35.943
I've become deeply concerned
about what we're leaving behind

00:00:35.967 --> 00:00:39.376
for our kids, and now my five grandkids.

00:00:40.756 --> 00:00:45.629
In the US, an area that's larger
than the state of Oregon has burned

00:00:45.653 --> 00:00:47.453
in just the last 10 years,

00:00:48.342 --> 00:00:52.192
and tens of thousands of homes
have been destroyed.

00:00:53.098 --> 00:00:57.862
Acres burned and homes destroyed
have steadily increased

00:00:57.886 --> 00:01:00.845
over the last three decades,

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:07.784
and individual fires that are bigger
than 100,000 acres --

00:01:07.808 --> 00:01:09.436
they're actually on the rise.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.230
These are what we call "megafires."

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.999
Megafires are the result of the way
we've managed this western landscape

00:01:18.023 --> 00:01:20.639
over the last 150 years

00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:22.776
in a steadily warming climate.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.576
Much of the destruction
that we are currently seeing

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.535
could actually have been avoided.

00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:34.138
I've spent my entire career
studying these western landscapes,

00:01:34.162 --> 00:01:36.130
and the science is pretty clear:

00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:40.929
if we don't change a few
of our fire-management habits,

00:01:41.996 --> 00:01:45.377
we're going to lose many more
of our beloved forests.

00:01:46.062 --> 00:01:48.753
Some won't recover in our lifetime

00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:51.579
or my kids' lifetime.

00:01:51.603 --> 00:01:55.982
It's time we confront
some tough truths about wildfires,

00:01:56.006 --> 00:02:00.113
and come to understand that we need
to learn to better live with them

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:04.112
and change how they come to our forests,

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.242
our homes

00:02:07.047 --> 00:02:08.591
and our communities.

00:02:09.654 --> 00:02:11.484
So why is this happening?

00:02:11.508 --> 00:02:14.134
Well, that's what I want
to talk to you about today.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.808
You see this forest?

00:02:20.536 --> 00:02:22.161
Isn't it beautiful?

00:02:29.877 --> 00:02:32.116
Well, the forests that we see today

00:02:33.108 --> 00:02:38.531
look nothing like the forests
of 100 or 150 years ago.

00:02:39.318 --> 00:02:42.981
Thankfully, panoramic photos
were taken in the 1930s

00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:46.893
from thousands of western
mountaintop lookouts,

00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:49.356
and they show a fair approximation

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.224
of the forest that we inherited.

00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:56.558
The best word to describe
these forests of old is "patchy."

00:02:57.303 --> 00:03:01.301
The historical forest landscape
was this constantly evolving patchwork

00:03:01.325 --> 00:03:05.084
of open and closed
canopy forests of all ages,

00:03:05.108 --> 00:03:08.600
and there was so much evidence of fire.

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:13.467
And most fires were pretty small
by today's standards.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.078
And it's important to understand
that this landscape was open,

00:03:18.102 --> 00:03:20.624
with meadows and open canopy forests,

00:03:20.648 --> 00:03:22.924
and it was the grasses of the meadows

00:03:22.948 --> 00:03:26.420
and in the grassy understories
of the open forest

00:03:26.444 --> 00:03:29.424
that many of the wildfires were carried.

00:03:31.797 --> 00:03:35.859
There were other forces at work, too,
shaping this historical patchwork:

00:03:35.883 --> 00:03:39.703
for example, topography,
whether a place faces north or south

00:03:39.727 --> 00:03:42.425
or it's on a ridge top
or in a valley bottom;

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.294
elevation, how far up the mountain it is;

00:03:45.318 --> 00:03:49.914
and weather, whether a place
gets a lot of snow and rain,

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:51.986
sunlight and warmth.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.079
These things all worked together

00:03:55.103 --> 00:03:57.006
to shape the way the forest grew.

00:03:57.974 --> 00:04:03.139
And the way the forest grew
shaped the way fire behaved

00:04:03.163 --> 00:04:04.511
on the landscape.

00:04:05.431 --> 00:04:10.680
There was crosstalk
between the patterns and the processes.

00:04:10.704 --> 00:04:12.601
You can see the new dry forest.

00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:15.827
Trees were open grown
and fairly far apart.

00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:18.296
Fires were frequent here,
and when they occurred,

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.898
they weren't that severe,

00:04:19.922 --> 00:04:21.352
while further up the mountain,

00:04:21.376 --> 00:04:23.499
in the moist and the cold forests,

00:04:23.523 --> 00:04:26.761
trees were more densely grown
and fires were less frequent,

00:04:26.785 --> 00:04:30.103
but when they occurred,
they were quite a bit more severe.

00:04:30.127 --> 00:04:33.770
These different forest types,
the environments that they grew in

00:04:33.794 --> 00:04:36.857
and fire severity --
they all worked together

00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:39.529
to shape this historical patchwork.

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:43.813
And there was so much power

00:04:43.837 --> 00:04:45.340
in this patchwork.

00:04:45.904 --> 00:04:48.431
It provided a natural mechanism

00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:52.004
to resist the spread of future fires
across the landscape.

00:04:53.002 --> 00:04:55.148
Once a patch of forest burned,

00:04:55.172 --> 00:04:58.447
it helped to prevent the flow
of fire across the landscape.

00:04:59.046 --> 00:05:00.537
A way to think about it is,

00:05:00.561 --> 00:05:05.124
the burned patches
helped the rest of the forest

00:05:05.148 --> 00:05:07.176
to be forest.

00:05:08.677 --> 00:05:10.528
Let's add humans to the mix.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:14.869
For 10,000 years, Native Americans
lived on this landscape,

00:05:14.893 --> 00:05:18.426
and they intentionally burned it -- a lot.

00:05:19.284 --> 00:05:23.176
They used fire to burn meadows
and to thin certain forests

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.245
so they could grow more food.

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:28.274
They used fire to increase graze

00:05:28.298 --> 00:05:32.134
for the deer and the elk
and the bison that they hunted.

00:05:32.158 --> 00:05:34.671
And most importantly, they figured out

00:05:34.695 --> 00:05:37.321
if they burned in the spring and the fall,

00:05:37.345 --> 00:05:40.884
they could avoid the out-of-control
fires of summer.

00:05:41.508 --> 00:05:45.992
European settlement -- it occurred
much later, in the mid-1800s,

00:05:46.016 --> 00:05:50.291
and by the 1880s, livestock
grazing was in high gear.

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:54.096
I mean, if you think about it,
the cattle and the sheep ate the grasses

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.161
which had been the conveyer belt
for the historical fires,

00:05:58.185 --> 00:06:02.279
and this prevented once-frequent fires
from thinning out trees

00:06:02.303 --> 00:06:03.924
and burning up dead wood.

00:06:04.634 --> 00:06:09.713
Later came roads and railroads,
and they acted as potent firebreaks,

00:06:09.737 --> 00:06:13.709
interrupting further the flow of fire
across this landscape.

00:06:13.733 --> 00:06:17.593
And then something happened
which caused a sudden pivot

00:06:17.617 --> 00:06:19.038
in our society.

00:06:19.489 --> 00:06:23.562
In 1910, we had a huge wildfire.

00:06:23.586 --> 00:06:26.302
It was the size
of the state of Connecticut.

00:06:27.275 --> 00:06:29.915
We called it "the Big Burn."

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:33.888
It stretched from eastern Washington
to western Montana,

00:06:33.912 --> 00:06:37.595
and it burned, in a few days,
three million acres,

00:06:37.619 --> 00:06:42.080
devoured several towns,
and it killed 87 people.

00:06:42.104 --> 00:06:43.853
Most of them were firefighters.

00:06:45.178 --> 00:06:49.161
Because of the Big Burn, wildfire
became public enemy number one,

00:06:49.185 --> 00:06:52.606
and this would shape the way
that we would think about wildfire

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:53.911
in our society

00:06:53.935 --> 00:06:55.766
for the next hundred years.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.311
Thereafter, the Forest Service,
just five years young at the time,

00:07:00.335 --> 00:07:05.467
was tasked with the responsibility
of putting out all wildfires

00:07:05.491 --> 00:07:09.033
on 193 million acres of public lands,

00:07:09.057 --> 00:07:10.997
and they took this responsibility

00:07:11.021 --> 00:07:12.184
very seriously.

00:07:12.872 --> 00:07:16.822
They developed this unequaled
ability to put fires out,

00:07:16.846 --> 00:07:20.098
and they put out 95 to 98 percent

00:07:20.122 --> 00:07:25.096
of all fires every single year in the US.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.522
And from this point on,
it was now fire suppression

00:07:29.387 --> 00:07:30.917
and not wildfires

00:07:30.941 --> 00:07:34.927
that would become a prime
shaper of our forests.

00:07:35.943 --> 00:07:39.443
After World War II, timber harvesting
got going in the west,

00:07:39.467 --> 00:07:42.590
and the logging removed
the large and the old trees.

00:07:42.614 --> 00:07:47.895
These were survivors
of centuries of wildfires.

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:49.851
And the forest filled in.

00:07:49.875 --> 00:07:54.796
Thin-barked, fire-sensitive
small trees filled in the gaps,

00:07:54.820 --> 00:08:00.766
and our forests became dense,
with trees so layered and close together

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.772
that they were touching each other.

00:08:03.357 --> 00:08:07.275
So fires were unintentionally blocked
by roads and railroads,

00:08:07.299 --> 00:08:09.734
the cattle and sheep ate the grass,

00:08:09.758 --> 00:08:14.078
then along comes fire suppression
and logging, removing the big trees,

00:08:14.102 --> 00:08:15.427
and you know what happened?

00:08:15.451 --> 00:08:17.705
All these factors worked together

00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:20.614
to allow the forest to fill in,

00:08:20.638 --> 00:08:24.617
creating what I call
the current epidemic of trees.

00:08:25.163 --> 00:08:27.146
(Laughter)

00:08:28.678 --> 00:08:29.854
Go figure.

00:08:29.878 --> 00:08:30.925
(Laughter)

00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:34.545
More trees than the landscape can support.

00:08:35.506 --> 00:08:40.266
So when you compare what forests
looked like 100 years ago and today,

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.776
the change is actually remarkable.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.210
Notice how the patchwork has filled in.

00:08:45.234 --> 00:08:46.782
Dry south slopes --

00:08:46.806 --> 00:08:49.099
they're now covered with trees.

00:08:49.843 --> 00:08:52.822
A patchwork that was once
sculptured by mostly small

00:08:52.846 --> 00:08:54.604
and sort of medium-sized fires

00:08:54.628 --> 00:08:56.121
has filled in.

00:08:56.145 --> 00:08:58.133
Do you see the blanket of trees?

00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:00.950
After just 150 years,

00:09:00.974 --> 00:09:03.531
we have a dense carpet of forest.

00:09:03.555 --> 00:09:05.288
But there's more.

00:09:05.312 --> 00:09:08.267
Because trees are growing
so close together,

00:09:08.291 --> 00:09:11.619
and because tree species,
tree sizes and ages

00:09:11.643 --> 00:09:15.290
are so similar across large areas,

00:09:15.314 --> 00:09:18.341
fires not only move easily
from acre to acre,

00:09:18.365 --> 00:09:22.462
but now, so do diseases
and insect outbreaks,

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:27.224
which are killing or reducing the vitality

00:09:27.248 --> 00:09:30.045
of really large sections of forest now.

00:09:30.488 --> 00:09:33.347
And after a century without fire,

00:09:33.371 --> 00:09:36.950
dead branches and downed trees
on the forest floor,

00:09:36.974 --> 00:09:39.001
they're at powder-keg levels.

00:09:39.956 --> 00:09:42.581
What's more, our summers
are getting hotter

00:09:42.605 --> 00:09:44.760
and they're getting drier

00:09:44.784 --> 00:09:46.606
and they're getting windier.

00:09:47.163 --> 00:09:52.656
And the fire season is now
40 to 80 days longer each year.

00:09:53.168 --> 00:09:55.668
Because of this,
climatologists are predicting

00:09:55.692 --> 00:09:58.912
that the area burned since 2000

00:09:58.936 --> 00:10:01.721
will double or triple

00:10:01.745 --> 00:10:03.649
in the next three decades.

00:10:05.015 --> 00:10:08.389
And we're building houses
in the middle of this.

00:10:08.413 --> 00:10:10.522
Two recently published studies tell us

00:10:10.546 --> 00:10:15.083
that more than 60 percent
of all new housing starts are being built

00:10:15.107 --> 00:10:17.725
in this flammable and dangerous mess.

00:10:19.145 --> 00:10:20.987
So when we do get a fire,

00:10:21.722 --> 00:10:25.772
large areas can literally go up in smoke.

00:10:28.363 --> 00:10:29.948
How do you feel now

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.271
about the forest image

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:35.749
that I first showed you?

00:10:35.773 --> 00:10:37.722
It scares the heck out of me.

00:10:39.729 --> 00:10:41.119
So what do we do?

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:45.520
We need to restore
the power of the patchwork.

00:10:45.544 --> 00:10:48.693
We need to put the right kind of fire

00:10:48.717 --> 00:10:50.619
back into the system again.

00:10:50.643 --> 00:10:56.805
It's how we can resize
the severity of many of our future fires.

00:10:57.277 --> 00:10:59.746
And the silver lining is
that we have tools

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:02.244
and we have know-how to do this.

00:11:02.268 --> 00:11:04.407
Let's look at some of the tools.

00:11:04.431 --> 00:11:09.198
We can use prescribed burning
to intentionally thin out trees

00:11:09.222 --> 00:11:11.048
and burn up dead fuels.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.829
We do this to systematically
reduce them and keep them reduced.

00:11:16.785 --> 00:11:18.167
And what is that going to do?

00:11:18.191 --> 00:11:21.065
It's going to create already-burned
patches on the landscape

00:11:21.089 --> 00:11:23.961
that will resist the flow of future fires.

00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:27.701
We can combine mechanical thinning
with some of these treatments

00:11:27.725 --> 00:11:29.416
where it's appropriate to do so,

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.214
and capture some commercial value

00:11:31.238 --> 00:11:34.169
and perhaps underwrite
some of these treatments,

00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:36.742
especially around urban areas.

00:11:36.766 --> 00:11:39.997
And the best news of all
is that prescribed burning produces

00:11:40.021 --> 00:11:43.677
so much less smoke than wildfires do.

00:11:43.701 --> 00:11:45.050
It's not even close.

00:11:45.074 --> 00:11:46.301
But there's a hitch:

00:11:46.962 --> 00:11:51.951
prescribed burning smoke is currently
regulated under air quality rules

00:11:51.975 --> 00:11:53.910
as an avoidable nuisance.

00:11:54.557 --> 00:11:56.238
But wildfire smoke?

00:11:56.262 --> 00:11:58.304
It simply gets a pass.

00:12:00.153 --> 00:12:02.718
Makes sense, doesn't it? (Laughs)

00:12:02.742 --> 00:12:04.017
So you know what happens?

00:12:04.041 --> 00:12:07.288
We do far too little prescribed burning,

00:12:07.312 --> 00:12:11.123
and we continually eat smoke
in the summers

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:12.548
from megafires.

00:12:12.572 --> 00:12:16.237
We all need to work together
to get this changed.

00:12:16.711 --> 00:12:18.672
And finally, there's managed wildfires.

00:12:18.696 --> 00:12:21.323
Instead of putting all the fires out,

00:12:21.903 --> 00:12:24.432
we need to put some of them back to work

00:12:24.456 --> 00:12:27.447
thinning forests and reducing dead fuels.

00:12:28.005 --> 00:12:30.672
We can herd them around the landscape

00:12:30.696 --> 00:12:32.609
when it's appropriate to do so

00:12:32.633 --> 00:12:36.536
to help restore the power
of the patchwork.

00:12:38.623 --> 00:12:42.362
And as you've probably figured out by now,

00:12:42.386 --> 00:12:44.592
this is actually a social problem.

00:12:44.616 --> 00:12:47.599
It's got ecological
and climate explanations,

00:12:47.623 --> 00:12:52.319
but it's a social problem,
and it will take us humans to solve it.

00:12:53.026 --> 00:12:55.458
Public support for these tools is poor.

00:12:55.482 --> 00:12:59.164
Prescribed burning and managed wildfires
are not well-supported.

00:12:59.188 --> 00:13:03.836
We actually all simply want fires
to magically go away

00:13:04.455 --> 00:13:07.670
and take that pesky smoke
with them, don't we?

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:14.150
But there is no future
without lots of fire and lots of smoke.

00:13:14.174 --> 00:13:16.753
That option is actually not on the table.

00:13:19.038 --> 00:13:24.219
Until we, the owners of public lands,
make it our high priority

00:13:24.243 --> 00:13:26.956
to do something about
the current situation,

00:13:28.002 --> 00:13:31.623
we're going to experience
continued losses to megafires.

00:13:31.647 --> 00:13:33.164
So it's up to us.

00:13:33.569 --> 00:13:36.288
We can spread this message
to our lawmakers,

00:13:36.312 --> 00:13:39.751
folks who can help us manage our fires

00:13:40.265 --> 00:13:42.137
and our forests.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.502
If we're unsuccessful,

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:51.196
where will you go to play

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.802
when your favorite places
are burned black?

00:13:57.096 --> 00:13:58.530
Where will you go

00:13:59.298 --> 00:14:00.762
to breathe deep

00:14:02.052 --> 00:14:03.375
and slow?

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.254
Thank you.

00:14:05.278 --> 00:14:09.289
(Applause)
