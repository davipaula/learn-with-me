00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:13.759
When you think of 
Archimedes' "Eureka!" moment,

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.294
you probably think of this.

00:00:16.294 --> 00:00:19.998
As it turns out, it may 
have been more like this.

00:00:19.998 --> 00:00:25.457
In the third century BC, Hieron,
king of the Sicilian city of Syracuse,

00:00:25.457 --> 00:00:26.907
chose Archimedes to supervise

00:00:26.907 --> 00:00:30.925
an engineering project 
of unprecedented scale.

00:00:30.925 --> 00:00:33.010
Hieron commissioned a sailing vessel

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.219
50 times bigger than a standard
ancient warship,

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.759
named the Syracusia after his city.

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:42.745
Hieron wanted to construct
the largest ship ever,

00:00:42.745 --> 00:00:45.443
which was destined 
to be given as a present

00:00:45.443 --> 00:00:48.334
for Egypt's ruler, Ptolemy.

00:00:48.334 --> 00:00:51.845
But could a boat the size
of a palace possibly float?

00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:55.752
In Archimedes's day, 
no one had attempted anything like this.

00:00:55.752 --> 00:00:58.994
It was like asking, "Can a mountain fly?"

00:00:58.994 --> 00:01:01.895
King Hieron had a lot 
riding on that question.

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:06.038
Hundreds of workmen were to labor
for years on constructing the Syracusia

00:01:06.038 --> 00:01:09.728
out of beams of pine 
and fir from Mount Etna,

00:01:09.728 --> 00:01:11.820
ropes from hemp grown in Spain,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.040
and pitch from France.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.379
The top deck, on which 
eight watchtowers were to stand,

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:19.621
was to be supported not by columns,

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:25.506
but by vast wooden images of Atlas
holding the world on his shoulders.

00:01:25.506 --> 00:01:27.053
On the ship's bow,

00:01:27.053 --> 00:01:33.469
a massive catapult would be able 
to fire 180 pound stone missiles.

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.233
For the enjoyment of its passengers,

00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:38.220
the ship was to feature 
a flower-lined promenade,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.121
a sheltered swimming pool,

00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:42.791
and bathhouse with heated water,

00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:46.350
a library filled with books and statues,

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.954
a temple to the goddess Aphrodite,

00:01:48.954 --> 00:01:52.069
and a gymnasium.

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.896
And just to make things 
more difficult for Archimedes,

00:01:54.896 --> 00:01:58.661
Hieron intended to pack 
the vessel full of cargo:

00:01:58.661 --> 00:02:00.803
400 tons of grain,

00:02:00.803 --> 00:02:03.470
10,000 jars of pickled fish,

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.074
74 tons of drinking water,

00:02:06.074 --> 00:02:09.199
and 600 tons of wool.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.982
It would have carried well over
a thousand people on board,

00:02:12.982 --> 00:02:15.393
including 600 soldiers.

00:02:15.393 --> 00:02:19.773
And it housed 20 horses 
in separate stalls.

00:02:19.773 --> 00:02:21.430
To build something of this scale,

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.132
only for that to sink 
on its maiden voyage?

00:02:24.132 --> 00:02:26.107
Well, let's just say that failure

00:02:26.107 --> 00:02:29.432
wouldn't have been a pleasant 
option for Archimedes.

00:02:29.432 --> 00:02:32.614
So he took on the problem: will it sink?

00:02:32.614 --> 00:02:34.929
Perhaps he was sitting 
in the bathhouse one day,

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:37.853
wondering how a heavy bathtub can float,

00:02:37.853 --> 00:02:40.324
when inspiration came to him.

00:02:40.324 --> 00:02:44.952
An object partially immersed in a fluid
is buoyed up by a force

00:02:44.952 --> 00:02:49.711
equal to the weight of the fluid
displaced by the object.

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:55.747
In other words, if a 2,000 ton Syracusia
displaced exactly 2,000 tons of water,

00:02:55.747 --> 00:02:58.243
it would just barely float.

00:02:58.243 --> 00:03:02.469
If it displaced 4,000 tons of water,
it would float with no problem.

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:05.895
Of course, if it only displaced 
1,000 tons of water,

00:03:05.895 --> 00:03:09.752
well, Hieron wouldn't be too happy.

00:03:09.752 --> 00:03:12.644
This is the law of buoyancy,

00:03:12.644 --> 00:03:16.085
and engineers still 
call it Archimedes' Principle.

00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:20.932
It explains why a steel supertanker
can float as easily as a wooden rowboat

00:03:20.932 --> 00:03:22.636
or a bathtub.

00:03:22.636 --> 00:03:25.780
If the weight of water displaced
by the vessel below the keel

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.088
is equivalent to the vessel's weight,

00:03:28.088 --> 00:03:32.425
whatever is above the keel
will remain afloat above the waterline.

00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:36.441
This sounds a lot like another story
involving Archimedes and a bathtub,

00:03:36.441 --> 00:03:39.691
and it's possible that's because
they're actually the same story,

00:03:39.691 --> 00:03:42.253
twisted by the vagaries of history.

00:03:42.253 --> 00:03:47.131
The classical story of Archimedes' Eureka!
and subsequent streak through the streets

00:03:47.131 --> 00:03:50.767
centers around a crown, 
or corona in Latin.

00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:56.771
At the core of the Syracusia story
is a keel, or korone in Greek.

00:03:56.771 --> 00:03:58.951
Could one have been 
mixed up for the other?

00:03:58.951 --> 00:04:00.659
We may never know.

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:05.507
On the day the Syracusia arrived in Egypt
on its first and only voyage,

00:04:05.507 --> 00:04:09.333
we can only imagine how residents
of Alexandria thronged the harbor

00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:14.084
to marvel at the arrival 
of this majestic, floating castle.

00:04:14.084 --> 00:04:18.515
This extraordinary vessel was the Titanic
of the ancient world,

00:04:18.515 --> 00:04:23.240
except without the sinking,
thanks to our pal, Archimedes.
