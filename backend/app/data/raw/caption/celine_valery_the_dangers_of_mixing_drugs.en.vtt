00:00:07.078 --> 00:00:10.538
Which of these three people 
is doing something risky?

00:00:10.538 --> 00:00:15.008
Is it the one who takes their cholesterol 
medication with grapefruit juice?

00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:17.489
The one who takes Acetaminophen pain 
relievers

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:20.440
for a sore ankle before 
going out for drinks?

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.209
Or the one who’s on a blood-thinning 
medication

00:00:23.209 --> 00:00:26.659
and takes an aspirin for a headache?

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.229
Actually, all of them are.

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:34.608
Each has inadvertently created a drug 
interaction that could, in extreme cases,

00:00:34.608 --> 00:00:37.128
lead to kidney failure; liver damage;

00:00:37.128 --> 00:00:38.688
or internal bleeding.

00:00:38.688 --> 00:00:40.318
Drug interactions happen

00:00:40.318 --> 00:00:43.718
when the combination of a drug 
with another substance

00:00:43.718 --> 00:00:47.398
causes different effects than either 
would individually.

00:00:47.398 --> 00:00:52.208
Foods, herbal supplements, legal drugs, 
and illicit substances

00:00:52.208 --> 00:00:54.528
can all cause drug interactions.

00:00:54.528 --> 00:00:57.938
Most drug interactions
fall into two categories.

00:00:57.938 --> 00:01:02.830
Some take place when two substances’ 
effects influence each other directly.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.223
In other cases, one substance effects 
how the body processes another,

00:01:07.223 --> 00:01:11.810
like how it is absorbed, metabolized, 
or transported around the body.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.670
Blood thinners and aspirin, for example,

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.510
have similar effects that become 
dangerous when combined.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.790
Both prevent blood clots from forming—

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.220
blood thinners by preventing the formation
of the clotting factors

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.930
that hold clots together,

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.640
and aspirin by preventing blood cells 
from clumping into groups

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.600
that become clots.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.570
Individually, these effects 
are usually safe,

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.550
but taken together, they can prevent blood
clotting to a dangerous extent,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.930
possibly causing internal bleeding.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.010
While blood thinners and aspirin are 
generally harmless

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.590
when taken individually,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.840
interactions where one substance 
exacerbates the effects of another

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.900
can also take place between drugs that
are independently harmful.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.650
Cocaine and heroin are each dangerous,

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.090
and those dangers compound when the 
two drugs are combined—

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.057
even though their behavioral effects may 
feel like they cancel each other out.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:08.899
Cocaine is a stimulant, and many of its 
effects, like increased heart rate,

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.599
cause the body to need more oxygen.

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.029
But heroin, a depressant, 
slows breathing—

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:19.054
reducing the body’s oxygen supply just 
when it needs more.

00:02:19.054 --> 00:02:24.326
This combination strains the organs and 
can cause respiratory failure and death.

00:02:24.326 --> 00:02:28.566
The interaction between grapefruit juice 
and certain medications

00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:32.276
in class of cholesterol-lowering drugs 
called statins,

00:02:32.276 --> 00:02:34.556
has to do with drug metabolism.

00:02:34.556 --> 00:02:39.780
The liver produces enzymes, molecules that
facilitate the breakdown of substances

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.800
that enter the body.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.180
Enzymes can both activate drugs,

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.180
by breaking them down into their 
therapeutic ingredients

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.623
from more complex molecules, 
and deactivate them,

00:02:50.623 --> 00:02:55.075
by breaking harmful compounds down 
into harmless metabolites.

00:02:55.075 --> 00:02:57.475
There are many, many different enzymes,

00:02:57.475 --> 00:03:01.420
each of which has a binding site that 
fits a specific molecule.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.680
Grapefruit binds to the same enzyme 
as statins,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.660
making less of that enzyme available 
to break down statins.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.550
So combining the two means that a 
greater concentration of the drug

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.834
stays in the bloodstream for a longer 
period of time,

00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:19.275
potentially causing kidney failure.

00:03:19.275 --> 00:03:24.354
Alcohol can also alter the function of the
enzyme that breaks down Acetaminophen,

00:03:24.354 --> 00:03:28.794
the active ingredient in pain relievers 
like Tylenol and paracetamol.

00:03:28.794 --> 00:03:33.744
When someone takes Acetaminophen, some
of it is converted into a toxic substance.

00:03:33.744 --> 00:03:35.454
At the recommended dose,

00:03:35.454 --> 00:03:39.134
there isn’t usually enough of this toxic 
byproduct to cause harm.

00:03:39.134 --> 00:03:41.994
But heavy drinking can alter enzyme 
activity

00:03:41.994 --> 00:03:44.674
so more of that byproduct is produced,

00:03:44.674 --> 00:03:46.424
potentially causing liver damage

00:03:46.424 --> 00:03:50.094
even with what’s usually a safe dose of 
acetominophen.

00:03:50.094 --> 00:03:54.880
Meanwhile, the herbal remedy Saint John’s
Wort increases the liver’s production

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.580
of a particular enzyme.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.560
That means the drugs this enzyme is 
responsible for breaking down

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.260
get metabolized faster—

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.378
sometimes too fast, before they can 
have their therapeutic effects.

00:04:07.378 --> 00:04:11.217
In spite of the dizzying number of 
possible interactions,

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:15.636
most of the dangerous interactions 
with commonly used drugs are well known.

00:04:15.636 --> 00:04:19.026
And new developments in science are 
helping us keep better track

00:04:19.026 --> 00:04:21.566
of drug interactions than ever.

00:04:21.566 --> 00:04:26.066
Some researchers are developing AI 
programs that can predict the side effects

00:04:26.066 --> 00:04:28.936
of drug interactions before they occur,

00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:33.558
using information about the landscape 
of protein interactions within your body.

00:04:33.558 --> 00:04:36.528
For the new drugs that are being developed
all the time,

00:04:36.528 --> 00:04:40.108
supercomputers are being used to find 
potential interactions

00:04:40.108 --> 00:04:43.108
while those drugs 
are still in development.
