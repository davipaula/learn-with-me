00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:15.874
My son was born in January 2020,

00:00:15.898 --> 00:00:18.145
shortly before the lockdown in Paris.

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:20.212
He was never scared
of people wearing masks,

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:21.752
because that's all he knows.

00:00:22.306 --> 00:00:26.458
My three-year-old daughter knows
how to say "gel hydro-alcoolique."

00:00:26.482 --> 00:00:29.507
That's the French word
for hydroalcoholic gel.

00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:31.841
She actually pronounces it
better than I do.

00:00:32.763 --> 00:00:34.927
But no one wants to be wearing a mask

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:38.605
or wash their hands
with hand sanitizer every 20 seconds.

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.567
We're all desperately looking at R and D
to find us a solution: a vaccine.

00:00:44.157 --> 00:00:46.167
It's interesting that in our minds,

00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:49.760
we keep thinking of the vaccine discovery
like it's the Holy Grail.

00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:54.253
But there are a couple of shortcuts here
that I'd like to unpack.

00:00:54.277 --> 00:00:56.950
I'm not a doctor, I'm just a consultant.

00:00:56.974 --> 00:00:58.672
My clients focus on health care --

00:00:58.696 --> 00:01:02.997
biopharma companies, providers,
global health institutions --

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:04.746
and they've educated me.

00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:08.465
We need to find the tools to fight COVID,

00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:11.050
and we need to make them
accessible to all.

00:01:11.796 --> 00:01:15.584
First, one single vaccine
will not get us out of this.

00:01:15.988 --> 00:01:18.253
What we need is an arsenal of tools.

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:22.070
We need vaccines, we need therapeutics,
we need diagnostics

00:01:22.094 --> 00:01:26.788
to make sure that we can prevent,
identify and treat COVID cases

00:01:26.812 --> 00:01:28.932
in a variety of populations.

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:32.826
Second, it's not just
about finding a tool.

00:01:33.798 --> 00:01:36.819
What do you think will happen
when one of those clinical trials

00:01:36.843 --> 00:01:39.154
demonstrates that the tool is effective?

00:01:39.178 --> 00:01:41.747
Do you think we can all
run to the pharmacy next door,

00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:43.766
we get the product,
we take off our masks

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.706
and we go back to French kissing?

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.731
No.

00:01:48.557 --> 00:01:52.177
Finding an effective tool
is just one step in this big fight,

00:01:52.201 --> 00:01:55.276
because there is a difference
between the existence of a product

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.201
and access to that product.

00:01:58.058 --> 00:01:59.303
And now you're thinking,

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:02.328
"Oh -- she means other countries
will have to wait."

00:02:02.741 --> 00:02:04.544
Well, no, that's not my point.

00:02:04.568 --> 00:02:06.647
Not only others may have to wait,

00:02:06.671 --> 00:02:08.587
but any of us may have to.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.894
The humbling thing about COVID

00:02:10.918 --> 00:02:13.820
is that because of its speed
and magnitude,

00:02:13.844 --> 00:02:16.463
it's exposing all of us
to the same challenges

00:02:16.487 --> 00:02:19.561
and giving us a flavor
of challenges we're not used to.

00:02:20.064 --> 00:02:22.634
Remember when China got into lockdown?

00:02:22.658 --> 00:02:25.278
Did you imagine that you
would be in the same situation

00:02:25.302 --> 00:02:26.507
a few weeks after?

00:02:27.016 --> 00:02:28.612
I certainly didn't.

00:02:29.057 --> 00:02:32.617
Let's go to the theoretical moment
when we have a vaccine.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.406
In this case, the next access challenge

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.846
will be supply.

00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:39.486
The current estimate
of the global community

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.743
is that by the end of 2021 --

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:44.843
so that's over a year after
the discovery of the vaccine --

00:02:44.867 --> 00:02:47.821
we would have enough doses
to cover one to two billion

00:02:47.845 --> 00:02:50.139
of the eight billion of us on the planet.

00:02:50.798 --> 00:02:52.450
So who will have to wait?

00:02:53.157 --> 00:02:55.941
How do you think about access
when supply is short?

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:58.140
Scenario number one:

00:02:58.164 --> 00:03:00.122
we let the market forces play,

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:03.865
and those who can pay the highest price
or be the fastest to negotiate deals

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:05.807
will get access to the product first.

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:07.793
It's not equitable at all,

00:03:07.817 --> 00:03:09.619
but it's a very likely scenario.

00:03:10.444 --> 00:03:11.785
Scenario number two:

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:14.433
we could all agree,
based on public health rationale,

00:03:14.457 --> 00:03:16.139
who gets the product first.

00:03:16.163 --> 00:03:19.183
Let's say we agree that
health care workers would get it first,

00:03:19.207 --> 00:03:20.683
and then the elderly

00:03:20.707 --> 00:03:22.663
and then the general population.

00:03:22.687 --> 00:03:24.737
Now let me be a bit more provocative.

00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:26.317
Scenario number three:

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:31.118
countries who have demonstrated
that they can manage the pandemic well

00:03:31.142 --> 00:03:33.368
would get access to the product first.

00:03:34.055 --> 00:03:35.937
It's a little bit extrapolated,

00:03:35.961 --> 00:03:38.209
but it's not complete science fiction.

00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:42.968
Years ago, when the supply of high-quality
second-line tuberculosis drug was scarce,

00:03:42.992 --> 00:03:44.692
a special committee was established

00:03:44.716 --> 00:03:48.133
to determine which countries
had health systems that were strong enough

00:03:48.157 --> 00:03:51.247
to ensure that the products
would be distributed properly

00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:54.600
and that patients would follow
their treatment plans properly.

00:03:54.624 --> 00:03:56.996
Those select countries got access first.

00:03:58.782 --> 00:04:00.225
Or, scenario number four:

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:02.042
we could decide on a random rule,

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:05.434
for instance, that people get
to be vaccinated on their birthday.

00:04:06.108 --> 00:04:07.542
Now let me ask you this:

00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:12.613
How does it feel to think of a future
where the vaccine exists,

00:04:12.637 --> 00:04:17.021
but you would still have to wear a mask
and keep your kids home from school,

00:04:17.045 --> 00:04:19.684
and you would not be able
to go to work the way you want

00:04:19.708 --> 00:04:22.331
because you wouldn't
have access to that product?

00:04:23.593 --> 00:04:26.763
Every day that passed
would feel unacceptable, right?

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:28.600
But guess what?

00:04:29.067 --> 00:04:33.219
There are many diseases for which
we have treatments and even cures,

00:04:33.243 --> 00:04:37.409
and yet people keep being infected
and die every year.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.907
Let's take tuberculosis:

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.963
10 million people infected every year,

00:04:42.987 --> 00:04:45.073
1.5 million people dying,

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:48.072
although we've had a cure for years.

00:04:48.096 --> 00:04:50.924
And that's just because
we haven't completely figured out

00:04:50.948 --> 00:04:52.757
some of the key access issues.

00:04:54.495 --> 00:04:57.126
Equitable access is the right thing to do,

00:04:57.801 --> 00:05:00.393
but beyond this humanitarian argument

00:05:00.417 --> 00:05:02.159
that I hope we are more sensitive to

00:05:02.183 --> 00:05:04.566
now that we've
experienced it in our flesh,

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.877
there is a health and an economic argument

00:05:06.901 --> 00:05:08.398
to equitable access.

00:05:09.104 --> 00:05:12.688
The health argument is that
as long as the virus is active somewhere,

00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:15.219
we're all at risk of reimported cases.

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:19.588
The economic argument is that
because of the interdependencies

00:05:19.612 --> 00:05:20.915
in our economies,

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:26.207
no domestic economy can fully restart
if others are not picking up as well.

00:05:26.977 --> 00:05:29.386
Think of the sectors
that rely on global mobility,

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.102
like aerospace or travel and tourism.

00:05:32.126 --> 00:05:34.635
Think of the supply chains
that cut across the globe,

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:36.515
like textiles or automotive.

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.409
Think of the share of the economic growth
that is coming from emerging markets.

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:46.211
The reality is that we need all countries
to be able to crush the pandemic in sync.

00:05:47.155 --> 00:05:50.140
So not only is equitable access
the right thing to do,

00:05:50.164 --> 00:05:52.168
it is also the smart thing to do.

00:05:53.263 --> 00:05:54.693
But how do we do that?

00:05:56.058 --> 00:05:59.443
Let's make sure we're on the same page
in terms of what "access" means.

00:05:59.467 --> 00:06:01.931
It would actually mean
that the product exists;

00:06:01.955 --> 00:06:04.544
that it's working sufficiently well;

00:06:04.568 --> 00:06:07.422
that it's been approved
by the local authorities;

00:06:07.446 --> 00:06:09.231
that it is affordable;

00:06:09.255 --> 00:06:12.488
but also that there is evidence
that it works in all the populations

00:06:12.512 --> 00:06:13.695
that need it,

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:18.229
and that can include pregnant women
or immunodepressed people, or children;

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:20.788
that it can be distributed
in a variety of settings,

00:06:20.812 --> 00:06:26.344
like hospitals or rural clinics,
or hot climate or cold climate;

00:06:26.368 --> 00:06:28.647
and that we can produce it
at the right scale.

00:06:29.266 --> 00:06:31.321
It's a very long checklist, I know,

00:06:31.345 --> 00:06:33.280
and in a non-crisis situation,

00:06:33.304 --> 00:06:37.634
we would likely address these issues
one after the other in a sequential way,

00:06:37.658 --> 00:06:39.241
which takes a lot of time.

00:06:40.423 --> 00:06:41.844
So what do we do?

00:06:42.609 --> 00:06:45.124
Access is far from being a new challenge,

00:06:45.148 --> 00:06:46.659
and in the case of COVID,

00:06:46.683 --> 00:06:49.986
I have to say, we're seeing
extraordinary collaboration

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.727
of international organizations,
civil society, industry and others

00:06:53.751 --> 00:06:55.356
to accelerate access:

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.208
working things in parallel,

00:06:57.232 --> 00:06:59.302
speeding up regulatory processes,

00:06:59.326 --> 00:07:01.045
engineering supply mechanisms,

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:04.149
securing procurement,
mobilizing resources, etc.

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:09.072
Yet we are likely to face a situation
where, for instance,

00:07:09.096 --> 00:07:12.053
the vaccine would need to be
constantly stored at, let's say,

00:07:12.077 --> 00:07:14.245
minus 80 Celsius degrees;

00:07:14.269 --> 00:07:16.788
or where the treatment
would need to be administered

00:07:16.812 --> 00:07:19.228
by a highly specialized
health care worker;

00:07:19.252 --> 00:07:21.561
or where the diagnostic
would need to be analyzed

00:07:21.585 --> 00:07:23.003
by a sophisticated lab.

00:07:23.873 --> 00:07:25.685
So what more can we do?

00:07:27.265 --> 00:07:30.018
Pushing further the logic
that the global health community

00:07:30.042 --> 00:07:31.695
has advocated for for years,

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:34.977
there is one additional thing
I can think of that might help.

00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:38.688
There is a concept
in product development and manufacturing

00:07:38.712 --> 00:07:40.561
that's called "design to cost."

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:43.588
The basic idea is that
the cost management conversation

00:07:43.612 --> 00:07:46.476
happens at the same time
as the product being designed,

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.942
as opposed to the product
being designed first

00:07:48.966 --> 00:07:51.457
and then reworked to bring the cost down.

00:07:51.854 --> 00:07:53.678
It's a simple method that helps ensure

00:07:53.702 --> 00:07:58.655
that when cost has been identified
as a priority criteria for a product,

00:07:58.679 --> 00:08:00.663
it's made a target from day one.

00:08:01.386 --> 00:08:04.519
Now, in the context of health and access,

00:08:04.543 --> 00:08:06.775
I think there is untapped potential

00:08:06.799 --> 00:08:08.296
in R and D to access,

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.477
the same way that
manufacturers design to cost.

00:08:12.012 --> 00:08:15.995
This would mean that,
instead of developing a product

00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:20.382
and then working to adapt it
to ensure equitable access later,

00:08:20.406 --> 00:08:22.559
all of the items
on the checklist I mentioned

00:08:22.583 --> 00:08:25.898
would be built into the R and D process
from the beginning,

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:28.453
and this would actually benefit us all.

00:08:28.477 --> 00:08:30.098
Let's take an example.

00:08:30.122 --> 00:08:33.633
If we develop a product
with equitable access in mind,

00:08:33.657 --> 00:08:36.908
we might be able to optimize
for scale-up faster.

00:08:37.616 --> 00:08:42.272
In my experience, drug developers
often focus on finding a dose that works,

00:08:42.296 --> 00:08:45.888
and only after do they optimize
the dosage or make adjustments.

00:08:46.555 --> 00:08:49.101
Now imagine that we're talking
of a candidate product

00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:51.620
for which the active ingredient
is a scarce resource.

00:08:52.044 --> 00:08:55.635
What if instead we focused
on developing a treatment

00:08:55.659 --> 00:08:59.371
that uses the lowest possible amount
of that active ingredient?

00:08:59.802 --> 00:09:02.065
It could help us produce more doses.

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:04.768
Let's take another example.

00:09:04.792 --> 00:09:07.655
If we develop a product
with equitable access in mind,

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:10.838
we might be able to optimize
for mass distribution faster.

00:09:11.788 --> 00:09:13.251
In high-income countries,

00:09:13.275 --> 00:09:15.412
we have strong health systems capacity.

00:09:15.436 --> 00:09:18.015
We can always distribute
products the way we want.

00:09:18.039 --> 00:09:20.750
So we often take for granted
that products can be stored

00:09:20.774 --> 00:09:22.739
in temperature-controlled environments

00:09:22.763 --> 00:09:27.084
or requires a highly skilled
health care worker for administration.

00:09:27.698 --> 00:09:28.875
Of course,

00:09:28.899 --> 00:09:32.407
temperature-controlled environments
and highly skilled health care workers

00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:33.877
are not available everywhere.

00:09:33.901 --> 00:09:35.888
If we were to approach R and D

00:09:35.912 --> 00:09:39.004
with the constraints
of weaker health systems in mind,

00:09:39.028 --> 00:09:40.542
we might get creative

00:09:40.566 --> 00:09:44.486
and develop sooner, for instance,
temperature-agnostic products

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.354
or products that can be taken
as easily as a vitamin

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:50.777
or long-lasting formulations
instead of repeat doses.

00:09:51.832 --> 00:09:57.136
If we were able to produce and develop
such simplified tools,

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.782
it would have the added benefit

00:09:58.806 --> 00:10:02.034
of putting less strains
on hospitals and health systems

00:10:02.058 --> 00:10:04.974
for both high- and low-income countries.

00:10:05.894 --> 00:10:07.310
Given the speed of the virus

00:10:07.334 --> 00:10:10.085
and the magnitude
of the consequences we're facing,

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:12.480
I think we have to continue
challenging ourselves

00:10:12.504 --> 00:10:15.705
to find the fastest way
to make products to fight COVID

00:10:15.729 --> 00:10:18.049
and future pandemics accessible to all.

00:10:18.501 --> 00:10:19.852
In my perspective,

00:10:19.876 --> 00:10:21.738
unless the virus disappears,

00:10:21.762 --> 00:10:23.655
there are two ways this story ends.

00:10:24.288 --> 00:10:26.148
Either the scales tip one way --

00:10:26.172 --> 00:10:28.371
only some of us get access to the product

00:10:28.395 --> 00:10:30.918
and COVID remains a threat to all of us --

00:10:30.942 --> 00:10:32.696
or we balance the scales,

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.085
we all get access to the right weapons,

00:10:35.109 --> 00:10:37.104
and we all move on together.

00:10:38.501 --> 00:10:41.183
Innovative R and D can't beat COVID alone,

00:10:41.207 --> 00:10:43.905
but innovative management
of R and D might help.

00:10:44.341 --> 00:10:45.540
Thank you.
