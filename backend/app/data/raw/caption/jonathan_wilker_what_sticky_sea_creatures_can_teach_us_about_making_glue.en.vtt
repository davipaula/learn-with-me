00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.760
So I'd like you to join me
on a field trip,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.586
and I want to go to the beach
and take you all to the beach

00:00:18.586 --> 00:00:20.826
and so enjoy the sea air
and the salt spray.

00:00:20.826 --> 00:00:23.060
And let's go down to the water's edge,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.864
and you'll notice we're getting
knocked around by the waves,

00:00:25.864 --> 00:00:28.441
and it's really difficult
to stay in place, right?

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:30.699
But now, look down,

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.095
and what you're going to see

00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:35.041
is that the rocks are covered
by all sorts of sea creatures

00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:37.351
that are just staying
there in place, no problem.

00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:41.630
It turns out that if you want to survive
in this really demanding environment,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.736
your very existence is dependent
upon your ability to make glue, actually.

00:00:46.736 --> 00:00:50.040
So let me introduce you
to some of the heroes of our story,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.500
just a few of them.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.623
So these are mussels,

00:00:52.623 --> 00:00:54.937
and you'll notice
they're covering the rocks,

00:00:54.937 --> 00:00:56.960
and what they've done
is made adhesives,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.939
and they're sticking down on the rocks,

00:00:58.939 --> 00:01:01.058
and they're sticking
to each other, actually.

00:01:01.058 --> 00:01:03.667
So they're hunkered down
together as a group.

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:06.431
This is a close-up photograph
of an oyster reef,

00:01:06.431 --> 00:01:08.581
and oysters, they're amazing.

00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:11.427
What they do is they cement to each other,

00:01:11.707 --> 00:01:14.523
and they build these huge,
extensive reef systems.

00:01:14.523 --> 00:01:17.115
They can be kilometers long,
they can be meters deep,

00:01:17.115 --> 00:01:20.751
and arguably, they are
the most dominant influence

00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:23.601
on how healthy any coastal
marine ecosystem is going to be

00:01:23.601 --> 00:01:26.558
because what they do
is they're filtering the water constantly,

00:01:26.558 --> 00:01:28.439
they're holding sand and dirt in place.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.461
Actually, other species
live inside of these reefs.

00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:34.843
And then, if you think about
what happens when a storm comes in,

00:01:34.843 --> 00:01:38.861
if the storm surge first has to hit
miles of these reefs,

00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:40.981
the coast behind it
is going to be protected.

00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:43.279
So they're really quite influential.

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.929
If you've been to any rocky beach
pretty much anywhere in the world,

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.510
you're probably familiar
with what barnacles look like.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.944
And so what these animals do -

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:53.621
and there's many others,
these are just three of them -

00:01:53.621 --> 00:01:54.752
is they make adhesives,

00:01:54.752 --> 00:01:57.992
they stick to each other and to the rocks
and they build communities,

00:01:57.992 --> 00:02:01.631
and by doing this, there's a lot
of survival advantages they get.

00:02:01.631 --> 00:02:07.540
So one of them is that just any individual
is subjected to less of the turbulence

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.203
and all the damaging features
that can happen from that environment.

00:02:11.203 --> 00:02:12.940
So they're all hunkered down there.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.049
Then, also, there's a safety
in numbers thing

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.241
because it also helps you
keep away the predators,

00:02:19.241 --> 00:02:22.073
because if, say, a seagull
wants to pick you up and eat you,

00:02:22.073 --> 00:02:24.994
it's more difficult for the seagull
if they're stuck together.

00:02:24.994 --> 00:02:28.690
And then another thing is it also helps
with reproductive efficiency.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.147
So you can imagine that
when Mr. and Mrs. Barnacle decide,

00:02:32.147 --> 00:02:34.350
"OK, it's time to have
little baby barnacles" -

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.769
I won't tell you
how they do that just yet -

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.170
but when they decide it's time to do that,

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.300
it's a lot easier,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.911
and their reproductive efficiency's higher
if they're all living close together.

00:02:44.918 --> 00:02:48.722
So we want to understand
how they do this:

00:02:48.722 --> 00:02:49.766
How do they stick?

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:51.819
And I can't really tell you
all the details,

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.918
because we're still trying
to figure it out,

00:02:53.918 --> 00:02:56.070
but let me give you a little flavor

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.262
of some of the things
that we're trying to do.

00:02:58.262 --> 00:03:02.221
This is a picture of one of the aquarium
systems we have in our lab,

00:03:02.221 --> 00:03:05.379
and everything in the image
is part of the system,

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.361
and so what we do is we keep -

00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:10.890
and you can see in the glass tank there,
at the bottom, a bunch of mussels.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.549
We have the water chilled,
we have the lights cycled,

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.581
we actually have turbulence in the system

00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:17.900
because the animals make
more adhesives for us

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.440
when the water is turbulent.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.340
So we induce them to make the adhesive,

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.240
we collect it, we study it.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.870
They're here in Indiana;

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.673
as far as they know,
they're in Maine in February,

00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:30.790
and they seem to be pretty happy,
as far as we can tell.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.770
And then we also work with oysters,

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.759
and up top, it's a photo
of a small reef in South Carolina,

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:41.080
and what we're most interested in
is how they attach to each other,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.090
how they connect.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.731
So what you can see in the bottom image
is two oysters cementing to each other.

00:03:46.731 --> 00:03:48.361
We want to know what's in between,

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.923
and so a lot of times,
we'll cut them and look down,

00:03:50.923 --> 00:03:53.520
and in the next series
of images we have here,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.130
you can see, on the bottom,
we'll have two shells,

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.773
the shell of one animal
and the shell of another animal,

00:03:58.773 --> 00:04:00.150
and the cement's in between.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.958
If you look at the image on the right,

00:04:01.958 --> 00:04:03.490
what you can maybe see

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.980
is that there's structure
in the shell of each animal,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.137
but then, the cement
actually looks different.

00:04:09.137 --> 00:04:13.115
And so we're using all sorts
of fancy biology and chemistry tools

00:04:13.115 --> 00:04:14.991
to understand what's going on in there,

00:04:14.991 --> 00:04:17.527
and what we're finding
is the structures are different

00:04:17.527 --> 00:04:21.841
and the chemistry is actually different,
and it's quite interesting.

00:04:22.731 --> 00:04:24.161
And in this picture -

00:04:24.161 --> 00:04:27.309
I guess, let me step back
before I tell you what this is.

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:32.380
So do you know the cartoon
"The Magic School Bus"?

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.490
Or if you're a little bit older,
"Fantastic Voyage," right?

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.299
And you remember, they had characters

00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:39.920
that they would shrink down
to these microscopic levels,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.960
and then they would sort of swirl in

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.063
and swim around and fly around
all these biological structures?

00:04:45.063 --> 00:04:49.280
I think of this as like that,
except for it's real in this case.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.040
And so what we did is we have
two oysters that are stuck together,

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.271
and this area used to be
completely filled in with the cement,

00:04:57.271 --> 00:05:01.231
and what we're finding is that the cement
has lots of different components in there,

00:05:01.231 --> 00:05:04.440
but broadly speaking,
there are hard, non-sticky parts

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.031
and there are soft, sticky parts,

00:05:06.031 --> 00:05:09.019
and what we did is we removed
the non-sticky parts selectively

00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:10.389
to see what's left -

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.600
for what's actually
attaching the animals -

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.759
and what we got is this,

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.360
and we can see there's a sticky adhesive
that's holding them together.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.389
And I just think it's a really cool image

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.459
because you can imagine yourself
flying in and going back there.

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:25.619
Anyways, those are some of the things
we're doing to understand

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:28.610
how marine biology
is making these materials.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.018
And from a fundamental perspective,
it's really exciting to learn.

00:05:32.018 --> 00:05:34.271
But what do we want
to do with this information?

00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:36.650
Well, there's a lot
of technological applications

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.340
if we can harness
what the animals are doing.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.182
So let me give you one example.

00:05:41.182 --> 00:05:43.185
So imagine you're at home

00:05:43.185 --> 00:05:46.817
and you break your favorite figurine
or a mug or something like that.

00:05:46.817 --> 00:05:48.440
You want to put it back together.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.560
So where do you go?

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.183
You go to my favorite place in town,

00:05:52.183 --> 00:05:54.983
which is the glue aisle
of the hardware store.

00:05:54.983 --> 00:05:56.951
I know where you spend your nights

00:05:56.951 --> 00:05:59.631
because you're all hip, cool people,
because you're here,

00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:01.960
and you're going to bars and concerts -

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.730
this is where I hang out every night.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:04.744
So anyways,

00:06:04.744 --> 00:06:08.496
so what I want you to do is get one
of every adhesive that's on the shelf,

00:06:08.496 --> 00:06:09.544
bring it home,

00:06:09.544 --> 00:06:12.470
but before you try
to put things back together,

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.369
I want you to try to do it
in a bucket of water.

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:17.491
It's won't work, right?
We all know this.

00:06:17.491 --> 00:06:19.890
So obviously, marine biology
has solved this,

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:24.811
so what we need to do is figure out ways
to be able to copy this ourselves.

00:06:24.811 --> 00:06:26.364
And one of the issues here

00:06:26.364 --> 00:06:29.290
is you can't just go and get
the materials from the beach,

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.727
because if you get some mussels
and try to milk them for their adhesive,

00:06:32.727 --> 00:06:34.450
you'll get a little bit of material,

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.149
but you're never going to have enough
to do anything with, just enough to see.

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:41.722
We need to scale this up,
ideally maybe train-car scale.

00:06:41.722 --> 00:06:45.709
So on the top is an image
of one of the types of molecules

00:06:45.709 --> 00:06:47.729
that the animals use to make their glue,

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:50.927
and what they are is very long
molecules called proteins,

00:06:50.927 --> 00:06:54.956
and these proteins happen to have
some fairly unique parts in them

00:06:54.956 --> 00:06:57.744
that bring about the adhesive properties.

00:06:57.744 --> 00:07:00.742
What we want to do is take
those little parts of that chemistry,

00:07:00.742 --> 00:07:04.173
and we want to put it into
other long molecules that we can get,

00:07:04.173 --> 00:07:06.563
but that we can make
on a really large scale,

00:07:06.563 --> 00:07:08.756
so you might know them
as plastics or polymers,

00:07:08.756 --> 00:07:11.093
and so we're sort of
simplifying what they do

00:07:11.093 --> 00:07:14.377
but then putting that adhesion chemistry
into these large molecules.

00:07:14.377 --> 00:07:17.494
And we've developed many different
adhesive systems in doing this.

00:07:17.504 --> 00:07:20.713
When you make a new adhesive
that looks pretty good, what do you do?

00:07:20.713 --> 00:07:23.773
You start running around the lab,
just sticking stuff together.

00:07:23.773 --> 00:07:27.633
In this case, we took a bit of a glue
and glued together two pieces of metal.

00:07:27.633 --> 00:07:30.132
We hung something from it
to see what it looked like,

00:07:30.132 --> 00:07:33.614
so we used a pot of live mussels,
and we thought we were very clever.

00:07:33.614 --> 00:07:34.621
(Laughs)

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:37.623
We're obviously much more
quantitative about this most often,

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:39.992
and so we benchmark
against commercial adhesives,

00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:44.013
and we actually have some materials now
that are stronger than superglue.

00:07:44.013 --> 00:07:45.419
So to me, that's really cool.

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:48.428
That's a good day in the lab:
it's stronger than superglue.

00:07:48.428 --> 00:07:50.994
And here's something else that we can do.

00:07:51.084 --> 00:07:53.219
So this is a tank of seawater,

00:07:53.219 --> 00:07:56.992
and then in that syringe
is one of our adhesive formulations.

00:07:56.992 --> 00:08:00.302
What we're doing is we're dispensing it
completely underwater

00:08:00.302 --> 00:08:01.612
on a piece of metal.

00:08:01.612 --> 00:08:04.153
And then we want to make
an adhesive bond, or joint.

00:08:04.153 --> 00:08:06.596
So we take another piece of metal,

00:08:06.596 --> 00:08:09.543
and we put it on there
and just position it.

00:08:09.543 --> 00:08:13.321
And you want to let it set up
for a while, give it a chance,

00:08:13.321 --> 00:08:15.570
so we'll just put a weight
on it, nothing fancy.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.753
This is a tube with lead shot
in it, nothing fancy.

00:08:18.753 --> 00:08:20.692
And then you let it sit for a while.

00:08:20.692 --> 00:08:23.397
So this has never seen air;
it's completely underwater.

00:08:23.397 --> 00:08:24.711
And you pick it up.

00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:27.932
I never know what's going to happen;
I'm always very anxious here.

00:08:28.042 --> 00:08:29.602
You pick it up ...

00:08:29.892 --> 00:08:31.277
and it stuck.

00:08:31.277 --> 00:08:32.822
To me, this is really cool.

00:08:32.822 --> 00:08:36.522
So we can actually get
very strong underwater adhesion.

00:08:36.522 --> 00:08:40.087
Possibly, it's the strongest or
one of the strongest underwater adhesives

00:08:40.087 --> 00:08:41.572
that's ever been seen.

00:08:41.572 --> 00:08:44.528
It's even stronger than the materials
that the animals produce,

00:08:44.538 --> 00:08:47.223
so for us, it's pretty exciting,
it's pretty cool.

00:08:47.223 --> 00:08:49.922
So what do we want to do
with these things?

00:08:49.922 --> 00:08:53.257
Well, here are some products
that you're probably really familiar with.

00:08:53.257 --> 00:08:58.043
So think about your cell phone,
your laptop, plywood in most structures,

00:08:58.043 --> 00:09:01.469
the interior of your car, shoes,
phone books - things like this.

00:09:01.469 --> 00:09:04.058
They're all held together with adhesives,

00:09:04.058 --> 00:09:05.662
and there's two main problems

00:09:05.662 --> 00:09:07.702
with the adhesives
used in these materials.

00:09:07.702 --> 00:09:09.762
The first one is that they're toxic.

00:09:09.762 --> 00:09:12.122
So the worst offender here is plywood.

00:09:12.122 --> 00:09:16.343
Plywood or a lot of furniture
or wood laminate in floors -

00:09:17.163 --> 00:09:20.451
a main component of the adhesives
here is formaldehyde,

00:09:20.451 --> 00:09:22.465
and it's maybe a compound you've heard of.

00:09:22.465 --> 00:09:25.298
It's a gas, and it's also a carcinogen,

00:09:25.298 --> 00:09:29.201
and so we're constructing
a lot of structures from these adhesives,

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:31.567
and we're also breathing
a lot of this carcinogen.

00:09:31.567 --> 00:09:33.312
So not good, obviously, right?

00:09:33.312 --> 00:09:36.118
The other issue is that
these adhesives are all permanent.

00:09:36.118 --> 00:09:39.386
And so what do you do with your shoes
or your car or even your laptop

00:09:39.386 --> 00:09:41.598
at the end of life,
when you're done using it?

00:09:41.598 --> 00:09:43.656
For the most part,
they end up in landfills.

00:09:43.656 --> 00:09:45.372
There's precious materials in there

00:09:45.372 --> 00:09:47.692
we'd love to be able to get out
and recycle them,

00:09:47.692 --> 00:09:49.153
but we can't do it so easily,

00:09:49.153 --> 00:09:51.695
because they're all stuck together
permanently, right?

00:09:51.695 --> 00:09:55.942
So here's one approach we're taking
to try and solve some of these problems,

00:09:55.942 --> 00:10:00.782
and what we've done here
is we've taken another long molecule

00:10:00.782 --> 00:10:02.519
that we can actually get from corn,

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:03.947
and then into that molecule,

00:10:03.947 --> 00:10:06.655
we've put some of the adhesion
chemistry from the mussels.

00:10:06.655 --> 00:10:09.282
So because we've got the corn
and we've got the mussels,

00:10:09.282 --> 00:10:11.681
we call this our surf-and-turf polymer.

00:10:11.681 --> 00:10:13.830
And it sticks. It sticks really well.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.022
It's very strong.

00:10:15.022 --> 00:10:16.922
It's also bio-based. That's nice.

00:10:16.922 --> 00:10:20.026
But maybe more importantly, here,
it's also degradable;

00:10:20.026 --> 00:10:22.299
we can degrade it
under very mild conditions,

00:10:22.299 --> 00:10:23.313
just with water.

00:10:23.313 --> 00:10:25.483
And so what we can do
is we can set things up

00:10:25.483 --> 00:10:27.654
and we can bond them
strongly when we want,

00:10:27.654 --> 00:10:29.921
but we can also
take them apart when we want.

00:10:29.921 --> 00:10:31.657
It's something we're thinking about.

00:10:31.657 --> 00:10:35.230
And here is a place
where a lot of us want to be.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:38.594
Actually, in this specific case,
this is a place we do not want to be,

00:10:38.594 --> 00:10:40.043
but we'd like to replace this.

00:10:40.043 --> 00:10:42.674
So sutures, staples, screws:

00:10:42.674 --> 00:10:46.292
this is how we put you back together
if you've had some surgery or an injury.

00:10:46.292 --> 00:10:48.148
It's just awful. It hurts.

00:10:48.468 --> 00:10:50.100
In the case of the sutures,

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:55.193
look at how much you're making
concentrated, mechanical stresses

00:10:55.193 --> 00:10:56.524
as you pull things together;

00:10:56.524 --> 00:10:58.268
you're making sites for infection;

00:10:58.888 --> 00:11:01.630
poke holes in healthy tissue -
it's not so good.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.433
Or if you need a plate
to hold together your bones,

00:11:04.433 --> 00:11:06.815
look at how much healthy bone
you have to drill out

00:11:06.815 --> 00:11:09.192
just to hold the plate in place -
so this is awful.

00:11:09.192 --> 00:11:12.502
To me, it looks like these were devised
in a medieval torture chamber,

00:11:12.502 --> 00:11:14.413
but it's our modern surgical joinery.

00:11:14.413 --> 00:11:18.146
So I'd love it if we'd get to a place
where we can replace systems like this

00:11:18.146 --> 00:11:19.769
with adhesives, right?

00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:21.439
It's not easy.

00:11:21.439 --> 00:11:23.486
We're working on this,
but this is not easy.

00:11:23.486 --> 00:11:26.566
So think about what you would need
for adhesives in these cases.

00:11:26.566 --> 00:11:28.004
So first of all,

00:11:28.004 --> 00:11:31.042
you would need an adhesive
that will set in a wet environment.

00:11:31.042 --> 00:11:33.419
And if you look at the silly
little picture there,

00:11:33.419 --> 00:11:38.089
it's just to illustrate that our bodies
are about 60 percent water,

00:11:38.089 --> 00:11:39.342
so it's a wet environment.

00:11:39.342 --> 00:11:43.942
It's also to illustrate that this is why
I am a scientist and not an artist.

00:11:43.952 --> 00:11:45.902
I did not miss my calling at all.

00:11:46.632 --> 00:11:50.130
So then, the other requirements you need
for a good biomedical adhesive:

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.950
it needs to bond strongly, of course,

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.458
and it needs to not be toxic.

00:11:54.458 --> 00:11:56.170
You don't want to hurt the patients.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:00.183
And getting any two of those requirements
in a material is pretty easy.

00:12:00.183 --> 00:12:01.497
It's been done many times.

00:12:01.497 --> 00:12:04.092
But getting all three
hasn't been done; it's very hard.

00:12:04.092 --> 00:12:06.753
And then if you talk to surgeons,
they get really picky:

00:12:06.753 --> 00:12:10.592
"Oh, actually I want the adhesive to set
on the same time frame as the surgery."

00:12:10.592 --> 00:12:11.602
Oh, okay.

00:12:11.602 --> 00:12:13.832
Or, "Oh, I want the adhesive to degrade

00:12:13.832 --> 00:12:16.852
so the patient's tissues
can remodel the site."

00:12:16.852 --> 00:12:19.722
So this is really hard.
We're working on it.

00:12:20.282 --> 00:12:21.874
This is just one image we have.

00:12:21.874 --> 00:12:26.153
So we're getting all sorts of bones
and skin and soft tissue and hard tissue,

00:12:26.153 --> 00:12:28.161
and sometimes we'll whack it
with a hammer.

00:12:28.161 --> 00:12:30.448
Usually, we're cutting it
in very precise shapes;

00:12:30.448 --> 00:12:32.003
then we glue them back together.

00:12:32.003 --> 00:12:34.624
We've got some exciting results,
some strong materials,

00:12:34.624 --> 00:12:36.730
some things that look
like they're not toxic.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.282
They set wet, looks pretty good,

00:12:38.282 --> 00:12:41.060
but I won't tell you we've solved
the wet-adhesion problem,

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.252
because we haven't,

00:12:42.252 --> 00:12:44.696
but it's certainly
in our sights for the future.

00:12:44.696 --> 00:12:49.833
So that's one place that we'd like
to see things go farther down the road.

00:12:49.833 --> 00:12:52.212
There's lots of other places,
too, you can imagine,

00:12:52.212 --> 00:12:55.163
we might be better off
if we could get more adhesives in there.

00:12:55.163 --> 00:12:56.565
So one thing is cosmetics.

00:12:56.565 --> 00:13:00.973
So if you think about people putting
on fake nails or eyelash extensions here -

00:13:00.973 --> 00:13:02.184
like this -

00:13:02.425 --> 00:13:03.367
what do they use?

00:13:03.367 --> 00:13:05.642
They use very toxic
adhesives right now.

00:13:05.642 --> 00:13:07.423
So it's just ripe for replacement.

00:13:07.423 --> 00:13:09.002
That's something we'd like to do.

00:13:09.002 --> 00:13:10.493
And there are other places too.

00:13:10.493 --> 00:13:12.332
So think about cars and planes.

00:13:12.332 --> 00:13:13.789
The lighter you can make them,

00:13:13.789 --> 00:13:15.841
the more fuel efficient
they're going to be.

00:13:15.841 --> 00:13:18.542
And so if we can get away
from rivets and from welding

00:13:18.542 --> 00:13:20.142
to put more adhesives in there,

00:13:20.142 --> 00:13:21.472
then we might be better off

00:13:21.472 --> 00:13:24.215
with our future generation
of transportation.

00:13:24.215 --> 00:13:28.713
So for us, this all
comes back to the beach.

00:13:28.713 --> 00:13:32.433
So we look around and we wonder,
"How do these sea creatures stick?

00:13:32.433 --> 00:13:34.502
And what can we do with the technology?"

00:13:34.502 --> 00:13:38.567
And I would argue that we have
really a lot of things we can still learn

00:13:38.567 --> 00:13:40.010
from biology and from nature.

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:42.683
So what I'd like to encourage
you all to do in the future

00:13:42.683 --> 00:13:48.423
is put down your nonrecyclable
laptops and cell phones

00:13:48.423 --> 00:13:50.431
and go out and explore the natural world

00:13:50.431 --> 00:13:52.992
and then start asking
some of your own questions.

00:13:52.992 --> 00:13:54.272
Thanks very much.

00:13:54.272 --> 00:13:56.572
(Applause)
