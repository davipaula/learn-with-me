00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.899
Meet Odontochelys semitestacea.

00:00:09.899 --> 00:00:14.079
This little creature spends its days 
splashing in Late Triassic swamps

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:16.500
with a host of other reptiles.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.500
Under the surface lies its best 
defense against attack:

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.520
a hard shell on its belly.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.990
Odontochelys is an early ancestor 
of the turtle.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.540
Its half-shelled body illustrates an 
important point about the modern turtle:

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.965
it actually has two shells that develop 
totally separately

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:37.375
while the turtle is still an embryo.

00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:39.785
Both are extensions of the animal’s 
skeleton,

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:43.299
and together they are made 
of almost 60 bones.

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:45.009
Like other embryos,

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:48.279
turtle embryos are made of 
undifferentiated cells

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:50.209
that become specific cell types,

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:52.179
and then organs and tissues,

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.949
through gene activity and communication
between cells.

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.849
At first, turtle embryos look very similar
to those of other reptiles,

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:02.281
birds, and mammals,

00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:06.151
except for a bulge of cells called 
the carapacial ridge.

00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:10.301
The ridge expands around the body 
between the neck and lower back,

00:01:10.301 --> 00:01:12.231
creating a disc shape.

00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:15.841
It guides the formation of the upper part
of the turtle’s shell,

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:20.741
called the carapace, likely by attracting 
the cells that will become ribs.

00:01:20.741 --> 00:01:24.221
Instead of curving downwards 
to make a regular rib cage,

00:01:24.221 --> 00:01:28.201
the ribs move outwards towards the 
carapacial ridge.

00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:30.481
They then secrete a signaling protein

00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:34.371
that converts surrounding cells 
into bone-forming cells.

00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:38.761
These fifty bones grow until they meet 
and connect with sutures.

00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:42.565
A ring of bone solidifies 
the carapace’s edges.

00:01:42.565 --> 00:01:47.085
The outer layer of skin cells produces 
the scales, known as scutes,

00:01:47.085 --> 00:01:49.532
that cover the carapace.

00:01:49.532 --> 00:01:53.362
The development of the bottom half 
of the shell, the plastron,

00:01:53.362 --> 00:01:55.552
is driven by neural crest cells,

00:01:55.552 --> 00:02:00.032
which can produce a variety of different 
cell types including neurons,

00:02:00.032 --> 00:02:01.905
cartilage and bone.

00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:05.745
A thick shield of these cells 
spreads across the belly,

00:02:05.745 --> 00:02:10.605
coming together in regions that produce
nine plate-like bones.

00:02:10.605 --> 00:02:14.981
Eventually, these connect to the 
carapace by sutures.

00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:19.043
A turtle’s shell has obvious advantages
for guarding against predators,

00:02:19.043 --> 00:02:22.757
but the rigid casing also presents 
some challenges.

00:02:22.757 --> 00:02:24.277
As the turtle grows,

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:28.407
the sutures between the bones 
of the carapace and plastron spread.

00:02:28.407 --> 00:02:32.107
Most mammals and reptiles rely on a
flexible rib cage

00:02:32.107 --> 00:02:34.477
that expands to allow them to breathe,

00:02:34.477 --> 00:02:38.607
but turtles use abdominal muscles 
attached to the shell instead:

00:02:38.607 --> 00:02:41.817
one to breathe in, 
and one to breathe out.

00:02:41.817 --> 00:02:44.027
So how did the shell evolve?

00:02:44.027 --> 00:02:46.357
Though there are still gaps in the 
fossil record,

00:02:46.357 --> 00:02:49.957
the first step seems to have been 
a thickening of the ribs.

00:02:49.957 --> 00:02:52.557
The oldest known turtle ancestor,

00:02:52.557 --> 00:02:55.767
a creature called Eunotosaurus africanus,

00:02:55.767 --> 00:03:01.927
lived 260 million years ago and looked 
almost nothing like a modern turtle,

00:03:01.927 --> 00:03:04.717
but it had a set of broad, flat ribs

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:08.017
that anchored the muscles 
of its powerful forearms.

00:03:08.017 --> 00:03:11.087
Eunotosaurus was likely 
a burrowing creature,

00:03:11.087 --> 00:03:15.657
digging homes for itself in what’s 
now southern Africa.

00:03:15.657 --> 00:03:21.145
Odontochelys semitestacea illustrates 
another, later step in turtle evolution,

00:03:21.145 --> 00:03:25.555
with thick ribs like Eunotosaurus 
plus a belly plate for protection.

00:03:25.555 --> 00:03:30.171
Our first fossil evidence of the full 
shell characteristic of modern turtles

00:03:30.171 --> 00:03:33.291
is about 210 million years old,

00:03:33.291 --> 00:03:37.741
and belongs to a species called 
Proganochelys quenstedti,

00:03:37.741 --> 00:03:39.861
whose ribs had fused.

00:03:39.861 --> 00:03:43.501
Proganochelys could move 
between water and land.

00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:47.771
Unlike modern turtles, it couldn’t retract
its head into its shell,

00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:51.514
but had defensive spines on its neck.

00:03:51.514 --> 00:03:56.284
Modern turtle shells are almost as diverse
as the turtles themselves.

00:03:56.284 --> 00:04:02.466
Sea turtles have flatter, lighter shells 
for streamlined gliding through the water.

00:04:02.466 --> 00:04:04.816
Land-dwelling tortoises, meanwhile,

00:04:04.816 --> 00:04:08.856
have domed shells that can slip free of
predators’ jaws

00:04:08.856 --> 00:04:13.536
and help them turn right-side up if 
they fall on their backs.

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:15.816
Leatherback and softshell turtles

00:04:15.816 --> 00:04:19.266
have shells without the ring of bone 
around the edge of the carapace

00:04:19.266 --> 00:04:21.536
or the tough scutes covering it,

00:04:21.536 --> 00:04:25.536
making it easier for them to 
squeeze into tight spaces.
