00:00:12.797 --> 00:00:15.707
I'd like to take you back
about seven years in my life.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:17.412
Friday afternoon,

00:00:17.436 --> 00:00:20.602
a few days before Christmas 2009,

00:00:20.626 --> 00:00:22.419
I was the director of operations

00:00:22.443 --> 00:00:25.776
at a consumer products company
in San Francisco,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.010
and I was called into a meeting
that was already in progress.

00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:32.483
That meeting turned out
to be my exit interview.

00:00:32.507 --> 00:00:35.517
I was fired, along with several others.

00:00:36.288 --> 00:00:38.467
I was 64 years old at the time.

00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:41.986
It wasn't completely unexpected.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.464
I signed a stack of papers,

00:00:44.488 --> 00:00:46.218
gathered my personal effects,

00:00:46.242 --> 00:00:48.059
and left to join my wife

00:00:48.083 --> 00:00:50.648
who was waiting for me
at a nearby restaurant,

00:00:50.672 --> 00:00:52.482
completely unaware.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.668
Fast-forward several hours,

00:00:55.692 --> 00:00:57.732
we both got really silly drunk.

00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:00.527
(Laughter)

00:01:00.551 --> 00:01:05.106
So, 40 plus years of continuous employment

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.566
for a variety of companies,
large and small,

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.026
was over.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.047
I had a good a network,
a good reputation --

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:13.504
I thought I'd be just fine.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.996
I was an engineer
in manufacturing and packaging,

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.473
I had a good background.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.319
Retirement was, like for so many people,

00:01:24.343 --> 00:01:26.271
simply not an option for me,

00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:29.136
so I turned to consulting
for the next couple of years

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.318
without any passion whatsoever.

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:35.407
And then an idea began to take root,

00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:38.652
born from my concern for our environment.

00:01:39.566 --> 00:01:41.986
I wanted to build my own business,

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.328
designing and manufacturing
biodegradable packaging from waste --

00:01:46.352 --> 00:01:49.352
paper, agricultural, even textile waste --

00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:54.343
replacing the toxic,
disposable plastic packaging

00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:56.692
to which we've all become addicted.

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:58.672
This is called clean technology,

00:01:58.696 --> 00:02:00.706
and it felt really meaningful to me.

00:02:01.153 --> 00:02:05.518
A venture that could help to reduce
the billions of pounds

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:09.216
of single-use plastic packaging
dumped each year,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.446
and polluting our land,
our rivers and our oceans,

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.660
and left for future
generations to resolve --

00:02:15.684 --> 00:02:17.047
our grandchildren,

00:02:17.071 --> 00:02:18.294
my grandchildren.

00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:22.551
And so now at the age of 66,

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:24.670
with 40 years of experience,

00:02:24.694 --> 00:02:27.116
I became an entrepreneur
for the very first time.

00:02:27.465 --> 00:02:28.562
(Cheers)

00:02:28.586 --> 00:02:31.243
(Applause)

00:02:31.267 --> 00:02:32.417
Thank you.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.461
But there's more.

00:02:35.485 --> 00:02:39.644
(Laughter)

00:02:39.668 --> 00:02:41.763
Lots of issues to deal with:

00:02:41.787 --> 00:02:46.167
manufacturing, outsourcing, job creation,

00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:50.076
patents, partnerships, funding --

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.790
these are all typical
issues for a start-up,

00:02:52.814 --> 00:02:55.053
but hardly typical for me.

00:02:55.077 --> 00:02:56.639
And a word about funding.

00:02:57.107 --> 00:02:59.702
I live and work in San Francisco,

00:02:59.726 --> 00:03:01.432
and if you're looking for funding,

00:03:01.456 --> 00:03:05.265
you are typically going to compete
with some very young people

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:07.079
from the high-tech industry,

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:10.614
and it can be very discouraging
and intimidating.

00:03:11.296 --> 00:03:13.709
I have shoes older
than most of these people.

00:03:13.733 --> 00:03:19.526
(Laughter)

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.701
I do.

00:03:20.725 --> 00:03:21.728
(Laughter)

00:03:21.752 --> 00:03:23.626
But five years later,

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.716
I'm thrilled and proud to share with you

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.531
that our revenues have doubled every year,

00:03:29.555 --> 00:03:31.063
we have no debt,

00:03:31.087 --> 00:03:33.756
we have several marquee clients,

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.080
our patent was issued,

00:03:35.104 --> 00:03:36.508
I have a wonderful partner

00:03:36.532 --> 00:03:38.595
who's been with me
right from the beginning,

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:41.678
and we've won more than 20 awards
for the work that we've done.

00:03:41.702 --> 00:03:43.459
But best of all,

00:03:43.483 --> 00:03:44.904
we've made a small dent --

00:03:44.928 --> 00:03:46.127
a very small dent --

00:03:46.151 --> 00:03:49.523
in the worldwide plastic pollution crisis.

00:03:50.552 --> 00:03:54.671
(Applause)

00:03:55.503 --> 00:04:01.393
And I am doing the most rewarding
and meaningful work of my life right now.

00:04:02.182 --> 00:04:07.227
I can tell you there's lots of resources
available to entrepreneurs of all ages,

00:04:07.251 --> 00:04:10.440
but what I really yearned for
five years ago

00:04:10.464 --> 00:04:13.677
was to find other first-time entrepreneurs

00:04:13.701 --> 00:04:14.852
who were my age.

00:04:14.876 --> 00:04:17.726
I wanted to connect with them.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.485
I had no role models, absolutely none.

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.734
That 20-something app developer
from Silicon Valley

00:04:23.758 --> 00:04:25.328
was not my role model.

00:04:25.352 --> 00:04:26.353
(Laughter)

00:04:26.377 --> 00:04:27.880
I'm sure he was very clever --

00:04:27.904 --> 00:04:29.309
(Laughter)

00:04:29.333 --> 00:04:31.000
I want to do something about that,

00:04:31.024 --> 00:04:33.303
and I want all of us
to do something about that.

00:04:33.327 --> 00:04:34.817
I want us to start talking more

00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:38.810
about people who don't become
entrepreneurs until they are seniors.

00:04:39.345 --> 00:04:42.263
Talking about these bold
men and women who are checking in

00:04:42.287 --> 00:04:44.883
when their peers, in essence,
are checking out.

00:04:45.523 --> 00:04:49.371
And then connecting all these people
across industries, across regions,

00:04:49.395 --> 00:04:51.038
across countries --

00:04:51.062 --> 00:04:52.227
building a community.

00:04:52.549 --> 00:04:55.036
You know, the Small Business
Administration tells us

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.269
that 64 percent of new jobs
created in the private sector in the USA

00:05:00.293 --> 00:05:02.974
are thanks to small businesses like mine.

00:05:03.596 --> 00:05:06.142
And who's to say
that we'll stay forever small?

00:05:06.567 --> 00:05:08.536
We have an interesting culture

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.936
that really expects
when you reach a certain age,

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.221
you're going to be golfing,
or playing checkers,

00:05:13.245 --> 00:05:15.798
or babysitting the grandkids
all of the time.

00:05:15.822 --> 00:05:18.726
And I adore my grandchildren --

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:19.800
(Laughter)

00:05:20.557 --> 00:05:22.564
and I'm also passionate

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:25.962
about doing something meaningful
in the global marketplace.

00:05:27.286 --> 00:05:29.126
And I'm going to have lots of company.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.549
The Census Bureau says that by 2050,

00:05:31.573 --> 00:05:34.852
there will be 84 million seniors
in this country.

00:05:35.577 --> 00:05:37.801
That's an amazing number.

00:05:37.825 --> 00:05:40.463
That's almost twice as many
as we have today.

00:05:40.487 --> 00:05:43.547
Can you imagine how many
first-time entrepreneurs there will be

00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:45.611
among 84 million people?

00:05:46.073 --> 00:05:48.652
And they'll all have
four decades of experience.

00:05:48.676 --> 00:05:50.471
(Laughter)

00:05:50.495 --> 00:05:55.911
So when I say, "Let's start talking more
about these wonderful entrepreneurs,"

00:05:55.935 --> 00:05:59.075
I mean, let's talk about their ventures,

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.663
just as we do the ventures
of their much younger counterparts.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.457
The older entrepreneurs in this country
have a 70 percent success rate

00:06:09.481 --> 00:06:10.923
starting new ventures.

00:06:10.947 --> 00:06:12.951
70 percent success rate.

00:06:13.407 --> 00:06:16.424
We're like the Golden State Warriors
of entrepreneurs --

00:06:16.448 --> 00:06:17.666
(Laughter)

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.121
(Applause)

00:06:20.145 --> 00:06:24.970
And that number plummets to 28 percent
for younger entrepreneurs.

00:06:24.994 --> 00:06:28.468
This is according to a UK-based
group called CMI.

00:06:29.013 --> 00:06:31.847
Aren't the accomplishments
of a 70-year-old entrepreneur

00:06:31.871 --> 00:06:33.508
every bit as meaningful,

00:06:33.532 --> 00:06:34.870
every bit as newsworthy,

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:38.011
as the accomplishments
of a 30-year-old entrepreneur?

00:06:38.035 --> 00:06:39.422
Of course they are.

00:06:39.446 --> 00:06:44.302
That's why I'd like to make the phrase
"70 over 70" just as --

00:06:44.326 --> 00:06:45.327
(Laughter)

00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:49.278
just as commonplace
as the phrase "30 under 30."

00:06:49.302 --> 00:06:50.303
(Applause)

00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:51.478
Thank you.

00:06:51.502 --> 00:06:52.786
(Cheers)

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.680
(Applause)
