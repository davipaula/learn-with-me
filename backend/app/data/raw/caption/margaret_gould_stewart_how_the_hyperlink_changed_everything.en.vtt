00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:14.048
I remember thinking to myself,

00:00:14.072 --> 00:00:17.389
"This is going to change everything
about how we communicate."

00:00:17.413 --> 00:00:18.564
[Small thing.]

00:00:18.588 --> 00:00:19.738
[Big idea.]

00:00:21.016 --> 00:00:23.579
[Margaret Gould Stewart on the Hyperlink]

00:00:23.603 --> 00:00:26.111
A hyperlink is an interface element,

00:00:26.135 --> 00:00:27.531
and what I mean by that is,

00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:31.071
when you're using software
on your phone or your computer,

00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:33.269
there's a lot of code behind the interface

00:00:33.293 --> 00:00:36.674
that's giving all the instructions
for the computer on how to manage it,

00:00:36.698 --> 00:00:39.729
but that interface is the thing
that humans interact with:

00:00:39.753 --> 00:00:42.601
when we press on this,
then something happens.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.408
When they first came around,
they were pretty simple

00:00:45.432 --> 00:00:47.504
and not particularly glamorous.

00:00:47.528 --> 00:00:51.098
Designers today have
a huge range of options.

00:00:51.956 --> 00:00:56.230
The hyperlink uses what's called
a markup language -- HTML.

00:00:56.254 --> 00:00:58.136
There's a little string of code.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.183
And then you put the address
of where you want to send the person.

00:01:02.207 --> 00:01:04.849
It's actually remarkably easy
to learn how to do.

00:01:04.873 --> 00:01:10.260
And so, the whole range of references
to information elsewhere on the internet

00:01:10.284 --> 00:01:12.246
is the domain of the hyperlink.

00:01:12.903 --> 00:01:14.410
Back when I was in school --

00:01:14.434 --> 00:01:17.894
this is before people had
wide access to the internet --

00:01:17.918 --> 00:01:19.735
if I was going to do a research paper,

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.504
I would have to physically walk
to the library,

00:01:22.528 --> 00:01:24.821
and if they had the book
that you needed, great.

00:01:24.845 --> 00:01:26.678
You sometimes had to send out for it,

00:01:26.702 --> 00:01:28.567
so the process could take weeks.

00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:31.496
And it's kind of crazy
to think about that now,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.755
because, like all great innovations,

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:36.969
it's not long after
we get access to something

00:01:36.993 --> 00:01:39.263
that we start to take it for granted.

00:01:39.287 --> 00:01:40.707
Back in 1945,

00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:43.310
there was this guy, Vannevar Bush.

00:01:43.334 --> 00:01:45.327
He was working for the US government,

00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:47.524
and one of the ideas
that he put forth was,

00:01:47.548 --> 00:01:50.195
"Wow, humans are creating
so much information,

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:53.458
and we can't keep track
of all the books that we've read

00:01:53.482 --> 00:01:56.172
or the connections
between important ideas."

00:01:56.196 --> 00:01:58.153
And he had this idea called the "memex,"

00:01:58.177 --> 00:02:00.519
where you could put together
a personal library

00:02:00.543 --> 00:02:04.606
of all of the books and articles
that you have access to.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.359
And that idea of connecting sources
captured people's imaginations.

00:02:09.383 --> 00:02:11.112
Later, in the 1960s,

00:02:11.136 --> 00:02:14.287
Ted Nelson launches Project Xanadu,

00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:15.621
and he said,

00:02:15.645 --> 00:02:18.674
"Well, what if it wasn't just limited
to the things that I have?

00:02:18.698 --> 00:02:22.132
What if I could connect ideas
across a larger body of work?"

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.758
In 1982, researchers
at the University of Maryland

00:02:25.782 --> 00:02:28.131
developed a system they called HyperTIES.

00:02:28.155 --> 00:02:31.600
They were the first
to use text itself as a link marker.

00:02:31.624 --> 00:02:34.827
They figured out that this blue link
on a gray background

00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:37.280
was going to work really well
in terms of contrast,

00:02:37.304 --> 00:02:39.090
and people would be able to see it.

00:02:39.114 --> 00:02:42.051
Apple invented HyperCard in 1987.

00:02:42.716 --> 00:02:44.651
You had these stacks of cards,

00:02:44.675 --> 00:02:46.961
and you could create links
in between the cards.

00:02:46.985 --> 00:02:52.444
HyperCard actually created the ability
to jump around in a story.

00:02:52.468 --> 00:02:55.356
These kinds of notions
of nonlinear storytelling

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.914
got a huge boost
when the hyperlink came along,

00:02:57.938 --> 00:03:02.073
because it gave people the opportunity
to influence the narrative.

00:03:02.097 --> 00:03:04.477
These ideas and inventions, among others,

00:03:04.501 --> 00:03:07.950
inspired Tim Berners-Lee,
the inventor of the World Wide Web.

00:03:09.246 --> 00:03:11.516
The hyperlink almost feels
like a LEGO block,

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.198
this very basic building block
to a very complex web of connections

00:03:16.222 --> 00:03:17.806
that exists all around the world.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.555
Because of the way
that hyperlinks were first constructed,

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.459
they were intended
to be not only used by many people,

00:03:24.483 --> 00:03:26.523
but created by many people.

00:03:26.547 --> 00:03:30.711
To me, it's one of the most democratic
designs ever created.
