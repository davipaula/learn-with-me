00:00:11.305 --> 00:00:16.814
Where in the world
is it easiest to get ...

00:00:18.134 --> 00:00:19.264
rich?

00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:25.893
That's the question I asked my professor
when I studied sociology in the early 90s

00:00:25.893 --> 00:00:28.270
because he was having a lecture

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.676
about social democracies,
the Scandinavian welfare state,

00:00:33.997 --> 00:00:39.229
and he was a classical
left-wing sociology professor,

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:42.224
and he could not hide his enthusiasm

00:00:43.062 --> 00:00:47.298
when he talked about
these egalitarian societies

00:00:47.298 --> 00:00:50.019
with no rich people and no poor people.

00:00:51.246 --> 00:00:56.578
But I, on the other hand, I was writing
my master's thesis about rich people.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:06.498
When I interviewed my informants
from the upper classes,

00:01:06.498 --> 00:01:08.305
they all said the same thing:

00:01:09.255 --> 00:01:12.335
"Life in Scandinavia is tough."

00:01:12.335 --> 00:01:14.575
(Laughter)

00:01:14.575 --> 00:01:18.583
"We have to work twice
as hard to earn money

00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:21.093
because we have to struggle against:

00:01:21.093 --> 00:01:22.125
high taxes,

00:01:24.415 --> 00:01:27.465
strong unions controlling the wages

00:01:27.465 --> 00:01:31.655
and a generous welfare state
that makes people lazy."

00:01:32.914 --> 00:01:35.244
As one rich guy told me,

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.696
he said, "They call it
a social security net.

00:01:40.206 --> 00:01:42.116
Well, I call it a hammock."

00:01:42.506 --> 00:01:45.486
(Laughter)

00:01:47.187 --> 00:01:52.841
And as every aspiring social scientist,
I started to go native;

00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:56.431
I started to feel sympathy
for these rich people.

00:01:57.375 --> 00:02:00.785
And that's why I raised my hand
and asked my professor,

00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:04.857
"Well, what if you don't care
so much about equality?

00:02:06.556 --> 00:02:10.156
What if your dream is to become rich?

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:16.159
Where in the world should I have been born
to become really rich?"

00:02:17.734 --> 00:02:21.544
I still remember the puzzled look
on my professor's face.

00:02:22.177 --> 00:02:23.891
But he answered the best he could.

00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:27.109
Something like,
"Well, if that's your goal in life,

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.533
you should probably
have been born in a society

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:33.300
with free markets, low taxes,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.090
and minimal government intervention.

00:02:37.534 --> 00:02:40.389
And he added, "If you want to become rich,

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.112
you should probably not study sociology."

00:02:43.112 --> 00:02:45.882
(Laughter)

00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:51.661
That was a good answer
and the best guess we had back then.

00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:58.357
That is until I saw that the University
of Oslo professor in Economy, Karl Moene,

00:02:58.357 --> 00:03:00.339
actually had checked the facts:

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:03.509
"Where in the world
is it easiest to get rich?"

00:03:05.347 --> 00:03:07.266
And before I share with you

00:03:08.246 --> 00:03:10.458
where you should go to earn money,

00:03:10.458 --> 00:03:12.761
we have to define "rich."

00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:16.461
The UN talks about the poverty line.

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.029
You know, if you earn
less than one dollar a day,

00:03:20.522 --> 00:03:21.923
maybe two dollars a day.

00:03:21.923 --> 00:03:25.163
But we have to define the richness line.

00:03:25.663 --> 00:03:27.913
It's a more fun line, actually.

00:03:29.427 --> 00:03:33.206
And the most reliable report,
when it comes to rich people,

00:03:33.836 --> 00:03:35.526
the Wealth Report,

00:03:36.496 --> 00:03:38.726
they set the richness line

00:03:38.726 --> 00:03:44.796
at individuals with net worth
more than 30 million USD.

00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:52.045
In the consultant jargon,
these people are called UHNWI's.

00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:55.821
That is Ultra High Net Worth Individuals.

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:00.669
That guy, by the way, is not rich.
He is just a model.

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.945
(Laughter)

00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:08.410
Actually, on the lower part of the model.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.880
(Laughter)

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.919
And I have saved some money
by keeping the watermark there as well.

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.489
(Laughter)

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.446
Smart.

00:04:19.446 --> 00:04:22.406
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:22.406 --> 00:04:25.712
So, according to The Wealth Report,

00:04:25.712 --> 00:04:31.540
there are more than 170, 000

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.810
UHNWI's in the world.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.756
And here is the top five list
of countries with the richest people.

00:04:39.756 --> 00:04:43.043
Number five: China, with more than 8,000.

00:04:43.043 --> 00:04:45.645
UK, Germany, Japan,

00:04:45.645 --> 00:04:49.207
and on top, of course, the United States
with more than 40,000 rich people.

00:04:49.527 --> 00:04:53.577
But of course, we are not interested 
in the absolute numbers here.

00:04:54.334 --> 00:04:59.674
We are interested in rich people
per capita, per million inhabitants.

00:05:00.567 --> 00:05:03.967
And if we leave out the pure tax havens,

00:05:04.386 --> 00:05:09.656
like Cyprus, and Switzerland,
Hong Kong, Singapore, Monaco -

00:05:10.137 --> 00:05:13.487
where we have an artificially
huge share of rich people -

00:05:13.844 --> 00:05:17.844
it turns out that we have
on number 5 Denmark -

00:05:17.844 --> 00:05:22.347
with 179 rich people
per one million inhabitants -

00:05:22.347 --> 00:05:26.147
Canada, New Zealand, Sweden
and on top: Norway.

00:05:26.147 --> 00:05:27.745
(Laughter)

00:05:29.598 --> 00:05:31.478
But where's the US?

00:05:32.458 --> 00:05:34.048
On place 13.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.412
So what happened to my old professor's,
you know, social democracies?

00:05:40.412 --> 00:05:42.072
There are no rich people there.

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:45.169
But OK. 30 million dollars,

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.625
that's just pocket money
in a country like the US,

00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:51.275
where people can get insanely rich.

00:05:51.786 --> 00:05:53.326
(Laughter)

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.810
Look at the watermark again?

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.873
(Laughter)

00:05:58.633 --> 00:06:04.003
So, let's raise the richness line
up from 30 million dollars up to ...

00:06:04.853 --> 00:06:07.333
1 billion dollars.

00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:14.684
And the most reliable source here
is the Forbes billionaires list.

00:06:15.785 --> 00:06:17.645
And according to the Forbes,

00:06:17.645 --> 00:06:20.700
if you look at billionaires
per million inhabitants.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.800
Number 5, Germany: 1.2 billionaires.

00:06:25.946 --> 00:06:30.956
1.2 billionaires per million inhabitants.

00:06:32.002 --> 00:06:35.552
The United States 1.7, Norway 2, Sweden,

00:06:35.552 --> 00:06:37.486
and on top Iceland with 3.1

00:06:37.486 --> 00:06:39.480
(Laughter)

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:43.250
With a single billionaire:
Thor Björgólfsson.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.251
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:06:50.745 --> 00:06:52.455
He could have been a model.

00:06:52.455 --> 00:06:54.505
(Laughter)

00:06:54.966 --> 00:07:01.284
But the point is, the United States: 1.7
Scandinavia taken as a whole: 2.1

00:07:01.284 --> 00:07:03.766
And the big mystery is ...

00:07:03.766 --> 00:07:04.975
How can this be?

00:07:04.975 --> 00:07:08.394
How can Bernie Sanders' dream societies,

00:07:08.394 --> 00:07:11.224
these socialist paradises

00:07:11.704 --> 00:07:14.424
be such a breeding place for rich people?

00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:16.789
(Laughter)

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:18.324
That's a mystery.

00:07:18.324 --> 00:07:20.611
(Laughter)

00:07:21.991 --> 00:07:23.523
There are two reasons.

00:07:23.523 --> 00:07:26.863
Reason number one is free education.

00:07:27.575 --> 00:07:33.334
Social democracies give free
higher education to everybody,

00:07:33.334 --> 00:07:36.316
and cheap student loans, and grants.

00:07:37.436 --> 00:07:42.686
That enables more people
to use their talents and earn money.

00:07:43.308 --> 00:07:46.938
We can see this
in the social mobility numbers.

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:49.949
Imagine all fathers in a society,

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:54.137
and we divide them into five groups
based on income:

00:07:54.137 --> 00:07:56.959
from the bottom fifth up to the top fifth.

00:07:56.959 --> 00:07:58.849
Then we look at their sons,

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.630
and divide their income into five steps,

00:08:03.689 --> 00:08:08.629
and we see how many sons of the fathers
from the bottom income

00:08:09.053 --> 00:08:11.073
end up on top.

00:08:11.073 --> 00:08:15.554
How many sons go from rags to riches?

00:08:17.544 --> 00:08:20.814
If it was perfect social mobility,

00:08:21.775 --> 00:08:26.325
if talents and opportunities
were equally distributed,

00:08:26.727 --> 00:08:31.157
20% from the bottom would end up
on each of these five ladders.

00:08:32.505 --> 00:08:35.898
So let's look at the numbers
for the different countries.

00:08:35.898 --> 00:08:39.195
In Denmark, they are pretty close
to perfect social mobility

00:08:39.195 --> 00:08:42.225
with 14% that goes from rags to riches.

00:08:42.775 --> 00:08:46.815
In Norway 12, Sweden 11,
the United States 8.

00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:50.033
Because of free education,

00:08:50.603 --> 00:08:55.313
there are more self-made men
in Scandinavia than in the US.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:09:02.493
And if we look at those sons who don't
end up on top but stay at the bottom,

00:09:03.065 --> 00:09:05.395
that go from rags to rags.

00:09:06.448 --> 00:09:10.728
Again, 20% would be perfect mobility.

00:09:10.728 --> 00:09:16.474
In Denmark, 25% ends up at the bottom,

00:09:16.474 --> 00:09:18.549
Sweden a bit more. Norway.

00:09:18.549 --> 00:09:20.639
And look at the United States.

00:09:21.726 --> 00:09:26.736
This is because education
in the United States is very expensive.

00:09:29.428 --> 00:09:32.708
But the second and
most important explanation

00:09:32.708 --> 00:09:37.808
for Scandinavia being such
a breeding place for rich people is this:

00:09:38.508 --> 00:09:41.402
Have you ever noticed
if you have been to the United States,

00:09:41.402 --> 00:09:45.912
when you drive around
and drive through a toll plaza,

00:09:45.912 --> 00:09:49.257
there are actually people sitting there
taking your money.

00:09:50.463 --> 00:09:53.786
Compare that to my local toll plaza.

00:09:55.046 --> 00:09:56.236
(Laughter)

00:09:56.236 --> 00:09:58.796
Just a sign with some
gizmo attached to it.

00:10:00.059 --> 00:10:03.689
And when you go to a supermarket
in the United States,

00:10:04.025 --> 00:10:07.635
there are actually people there helping
to pack your things into your bags.

00:10:07.635 --> 00:10:11.454
It's very friendly and convenient
compared to my local grocery store.

00:10:11.853 --> 00:10:12.963
Like this.

00:10:12.963 --> 00:10:14.222
(Laughter)

00:10:14.222 --> 00:10:15.962
There's nobody there.

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:20.641
(Laughter)

00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:24.060
The biggest shock I had
when I went to the US for the first time,

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.711
when I went to the restroom,

00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:28.311
there were actually people working there.

00:10:28.942 --> 00:10:31.692
Compare that to my local public toilet.

00:10:32.174 --> 00:10:34.553
(Laughter)

00:10:34.553 --> 00:10:38.944
There's not even a cleaner there;
it cleans itself automatically.

00:10:39.437 --> 00:10:41.706
And the reason for this difference

00:10:41.706 --> 00:10:46.566
is that Scandinavian unions
are pressing up the minimum wages.

00:10:47.477 --> 00:10:51.507
It's so expensive to have
these people working there.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:56.101
In Norway, tollbooth operators,
supermarket packers,

00:10:56.101 --> 00:10:58.112
and a restroom janitor

00:10:58.112 --> 00:11:01.632
would earn almost three times
as much as in the US.

00:11:02.089 --> 00:11:05.829
And that's why we have replaced
these people with machines.

00:11:07.643 --> 00:11:12.406
That is why I was surprised
when I saw this article

00:11:12.406 --> 00:11:15.266
in The New York Times in 2014.

00:11:16.016 --> 00:11:19.498
Preparing for Chip-and-PIN Cards
in the United States.

00:11:19.498 --> 00:11:21.078
(Laughter)

00:11:22.338 --> 00:11:27.078
Because in the United States
people are still using paper checks

00:11:27.078 --> 00:11:28.599
as a method of payment,

00:11:28.599 --> 00:11:34.769
while Scandinavian banks have made us 
start using Chip-and-PIN cards long ago.

00:11:35.822 --> 00:11:38.461
Because the minimum wages
here are so high.

00:11:38.461 --> 00:11:44.701
So Scandinavian banks can't afford
having people manually control the checks.

00:11:46.431 --> 00:11:48.611
So Scandinavian companies,

00:11:49.074 --> 00:11:52.184
because of the unions
pressing up the wages,

00:11:52.184 --> 00:11:57.331
they have to downsize
and introduce new technology or else ...

00:11:58.141 --> 00:11:59.861
they will go broke.

00:12:00.206 --> 00:12:05.734
And new technology increases
the productivity in a society,

00:12:05.734 --> 00:12:09.484
which in the long run
also increases profit.

00:12:11.375 --> 00:12:15.245
And on the upper end of the wage ladder,

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:18.159
in the name of solidarity,

00:12:18.984 --> 00:12:25.004
Scandinavian unions hold back the highest
salaries of the skilled workers.

00:12:25.004 --> 00:12:30.428
So for example,
a Norwegian senior engineer -

00:12:31.182 --> 00:12:32.752
it's my uncle, by the way.

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:35.222
(Laughter)

00:12:36.762 --> 00:12:38.882
That's why there's no watermark there.

00:12:38.882 --> 00:12:41.512
(Laughter)

00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:45.344
Actually, he would look cooler
with a watermark, better.

00:12:45.345 --> 00:12:46.872
(Laughter)

00:12:46.872 --> 00:12:51.032
He earns, on average per year,
76,000 dollars,

00:12:51.032 --> 00:12:56.042
while his American colleague earns
more than 100,000 dollars.

00:12:56.682 --> 00:13:00.222
So American engineers ...

00:13:00.222 --> 00:13:02.742
(Laughter)

00:13:02.742 --> 00:13:08.455
They are not only more good-looking,
but they are more expensive.

00:13:10.515 --> 00:13:16.365
Of course, this wage restraint
on high-skilled work is good for profit.

00:13:17.346 --> 00:13:23.276
So, the unions are in effect
subsidizing the capitalists.

00:13:24.431 --> 00:13:28.217
I wish I knew all this when I gave up
a career in social science

00:13:28.217 --> 00:13:34.217
because the beauty and the irony
of these findings, I think, is amazing.

00:13:34.919 --> 00:13:38.499
On the one hand,
you have my rich informants

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:44.860
that complain about how hard
it is to get rich in Scandinavia.

00:13:45.239 --> 00:13:47.269
They had it all wrong.

00:13:47.581 --> 00:13:52.331
Not only is it easier to get rich
in a social democracy,

00:13:53.144 --> 00:13:57.202
but they are critical
to the very institutions

00:13:57.202 --> 00:13:59.362
that have helped them get rich.

00:14:00.124 --> 00:14:06.054
High taxes, which gives free education
and more talent into the economy.

00:14:06.617 --> 00:14:12.667
Strong unions that are helping
to increase productivity,

00:14:13.824 --> 00:14:19.253
and a generous welfare state
that makes the unions accept downsizing

00:14:19.253 --> 00:14:23.528
because they know that their members
will be well taken care of.

00:14:23.528 --> 00:14:27.518
So the unions cooperate
because of the safety net.

00:14:28.755 --> 00:14:33.435
So rich people are a bit like
Immanuel Kant's famous bird,

00:14:34.287 --> 00:14:39.667
who thinks she could fly
even faster in airless space,

00:14:40.311 --> 00:14:44.251
forgetting that it's the air itself
that gives her lift.

00:14:46.847 --> 00:14:49.192
On the other part
of the political spectrum,

00:14:49.192 --> 00:14:53.660
when Bernie Sanders is praising
Scandinavian societies,

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:59.790
he forgets that these are not anti-rich
or anti-capitalist systems.

00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:05.761
Because the welfare state and the unions
work in tandem with capitalist dynamics.

00:15:06.271 --> 00:15:09.641
And I think that is the most
important lesson here.

00:15:10.434 --> 00:15:13.205
The economy is not a zero-sum game.

00:15:13.205 --> 00:15:14.885
We are in this together.

00:15:15.523 --> 00:15:18.873
And that is why Scandinavia
is a better place

00:15:18.873 --> 00:15:21.395
to fulfill the American dream ...

00:15:21.395 --> 00:15:22.567
(Laughter)

00:15:22.567 --> 00:15:24.416
than America itself.

00:15:24.416 --> 00:15:25.767
Thank you so much.

00:15:25.767 --> 00:15:28.286
(Applause) (Cheering)
