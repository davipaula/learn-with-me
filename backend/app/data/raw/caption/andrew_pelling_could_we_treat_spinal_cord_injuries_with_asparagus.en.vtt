00:00:12.917 --> 00:00:16.101
So I'm here today surrounded
by all these fruits and vegetables,

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:19.726
because these are the subjects
of my experiments.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.393
Now, bear with me for just a second,

00:00:22.417 --> 00:00:23.851
but about a decade ago

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:27.601
my team started to rethink
how we make materials

00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:31.351
for reconstructing
damaged or diseased human tissues,

00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:34.143
and we made the totally
unexpected discovery

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:37.768
that plants could be used
for this purpose.

00:00:37.792 --> 00:00:40.643
In fact, we invented a way
to take these plants

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:43.351
and strip them of all their DNA
and their cells,

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:46.226
leaving behind natural fibers.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.018
And these fibers
could then be used as a scaffold

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:51.184
for reconstructing living tissue.

00:00:51.208 --> 00:00:53.143
Now I know this is a little weird,

00:00:53.167 --> 00:00:56.059
but in our very first
proof-of-concept experiment,

00:00:56.083 --> 00:00:57.518
we took an apple,

00:00:57.542 --> 00:01:00.393
carved it into the shape of a human ear,

00:01:00.417 --> 00:01:03.101
and then we took that ear-shaped scaffold,

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:04.726
sterilized it, processed it

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.893
and coaxed human cells
to grow inside of it.

00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:10.643
We then took the next step
and implanted it,

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:12.226
and we were able to demonstrate

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.601
that the scaffolds stimulated
the formation of blood vessels,

00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:18.809
allowing the heart to keep them alive.

00:01:18.833 --> 00:01:21.893
So not too long after
these discoveries were taking place,

00:01:21.917 --> 00:01:24.393
I was at home cooking
asparagus for dinner,

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:26.268
and after cutting the ends off,

00:01:26.292 --> 00:01:30.768
I was noticing that the stalks were full
of these microchanneled vascular bundles.

00:01:30.792 --> 00:01:32.101
And it really reminded me

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:36.542
of a whole body of bioengineering effort
aimed at treating spinal cord injury.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.726
Up to half a million people per year
suffer from this type of injury,

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.601
and the symptoms can range
from pain and numbness

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:46.226
to devastating traumas

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.976
that lead to a complete loss
of motor function and independence.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.809
And in these forms of paralysis,

00:01:51.833 --> 00:01:54.851
there's no accepted treatment strategy,

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:57.059
but one possible solution

00:01:57.083 --> 00:02:00.476
might be the use of a scaffold
that has microchannels

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.143
which may guide regenerating neurons.

00:02:03.167 --> 00:02:07.726
So, could we use the asparagus
and its vascular bundles

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.018
to repair a spinal cord?

00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:13.643
This is a really dumb idea.

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:16.309
First of all, humans aren't plants.

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:19.268
Our cells have not evolved
to grow on plant polymers,

00:02:19.292 --> 00:02:23.559
and plant tissues have no business
being found in your spinal cord.

00:02:23.583 --> 00:02:24.851
And secondly,

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:27.768
ideally these types of scaffolds
should disappear over time,

00:02:27.792 --> 00:02:30.726
leaving behind natural, healthy tissue.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.684
But plant-based scaffolds don't do that,

00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:35.601
because we lack the enzymes
to break them down.

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:36.934
Funnily enough,

00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:40.934
these properties were exactly why
we were having so much success.

00:02:40.958 --> 00:02:43.351
Over the course of many experiments,

00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:44.726
we were able to demonstrate

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.476
that the inertness of plant tissue
is exactly why it's so biocompatible.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.643
In a way, the body
almost doesn't even see it,

00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:57.226
but regenerating cells
benefit from its shape and stability.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.851
Now this is all well and good,

00:02:58.875 --> 00:03:01.018
but I constantly felt this weight of doubt

00:03:01.042 --> 00:03:03.559
when it came to thinking
about spinal cords.

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:07.434
So many scientists were using
materials from traditional sources,

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:09.934
like synthetic polymers
and animal products --

00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:11.684
even human cadavers.

00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:13.643
I felt like a complete outsider

00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:17.559
with no real right
to work on such a hard problem.

00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:19.059
But because of this doubt,

00:03:19.083 --> 00:03:21.976
I surrounded myself
with neurosurgeons and clinicians,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.059
biochemists and bioengineers,

00:03:24.083 --> 00:03:26.601
and we started to plan experiments.

00:03:26.625 --> 00:03:29.768
The basic idea is that we
would take an animal,

00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:31.226
anesthetize it,

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.726
expose its spinal cord

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.851
and sever it in the thoracic region,

00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:37.559
rendering the animal a paraplegic.

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:39.976
We would then implant
an asparagus scaffold

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.059
between the severed
ends of the spinal cord

00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:43.934
to act as a bridge.

00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:46.309
Now this is crucially important.

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:48.601
We're only using asparagus.

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:51.643
We're not adding stem cells
or electrical stimulation

00:03:51.667 --> 00:03:53.018
or exoskeletons

00:03:53.042 --> 00:03:54.351
or physical therapy

00:03:54.375 --> 00:03:55.893
or pharmaceuticals.

00:03:55.917 --> 00:03:57.434
We're simply investigating

00:03:57.458 --> 00:04:00.434
if the microchannels in the scaffold alone

00:04:00.458 --> 00:04:03.184
are enough to guide
the regeneration of neurons.

00:04:03.208 --> 00:04:05.184
And here are the main results.

00:04:05.208 --> 00:04:09.976
In this video, you can see an animal
about eight weeks after being paralyzed.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.976
You can see she can't move her back legs,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.309
and she can't lift herself up.

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:17.851
Now I know how difficult
this video is to watch.

00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:22.518
My team struggled every day
with these types of experiments,

00:04:22.542 --> 00:04:27.018
and we constantly asked ourselves
why we were doing this ...

00:04:27.042 --> 00:04:30.292
until we started to observe
something extraordinary.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.934
This is an animal
that received an implant.

00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:35.559
Now she's not walking perfectly,

00:04:35.583 --> 00:04:37.393
but she's moving those back legs

00:04:37.417 --> 00:04:39.976
and she's even starting
to lift herself up.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.268
And on a treadmill,

00:04:41.292 --> 00:04:44.309
you can see those legs moving
in a coordinated fashion.

00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:47.417
These are crucial signs of recovery.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.893
Now we still have a lot of work to do,

00:04:50.917 --> 00:04:53.893
and there are a lot
of questions to answer,

00:04:53.917 --> 00:04:57.268
but this is the first time
anyone has shown

00:04:57.292 --> 00:05:01.583
that plant tissues can be used
to repair such a complex injury.

00:05:02.458 --> 00:05:07.059
Even so, we've been sitting
on this data for over five years.

00:05:07.083 --> 00:05:11.476
Doubt drove us to repeat
these experiments again and again,

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.184
to the point of almost bankrupting my lab.

00:05:14.208 --> 00:05:15.559
But I kept pushing,

00:05:15.583 --> 00:05:19.417
because I knew these results could be
the start of something extraordinary.

00:05:20.708 --> 00:05:22.059
And what's just as exciting

00:05:22.083 --> 00:05:25.893
is that my company is now translating
these discoveries into the clinic --

00:05:25.917 --> 00:05:27.934
into the real world.

00:05:27.958 --> 00:05:33.518
This technology has just been designated
a breakthrough medical device by the FDA.

00:05:33.542 --> 00:05:34.851
And this designation means

00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:38.393
that right now we're in the midst
of planning human clinical trials

00:05:38.417 --> 00:05:40.792
set to begin in about two years.

00:05:41.583 --> 00:05:43.351
So I'd like to show you a prototype

00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:46.143
of one of our state-of-the-art
spinal cord implants.

00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:47.684
It's still made from asparagus

00:05:47.708 --> 00:05:49.768
and contains all of those microchannels.

00:05:49.792 --> 00:05:51.851
And you can see that it moves and bends

00:05:51.875 --> 00:05:54.542
and has the same feel as human tissue.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.268
And you know,

00:05:57.292 --> 00:06:00.809
I think the real innovation
is that we're now able to design

00:06:00.833 --> 00:06:05.226
or program the architecture and structure
of plant tissues in such a way

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.934
that they could direct cell growth
to address an unmet medical need.

00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.226
As scientists,

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.476
we spend our lives
living on a knife's edge.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.768
On the one hand,

00:06:14.792 --> 00:06:17.143
it's our job to fundamentally
broaden the horizons

00:06:17.167 --> 00:06:18.476
of human knowledge,

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.768
but at the same time,
we're trained to doubt --

00:06:20.792 --> 00:06:23.559
to doubt our data,
to doubt our experiments,

00:06:23.583 --> 00:06:25.476
to doubt our own conclusions.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.809
We spend our lives
crushed under the weight

00:06:27.833 --> 00:06:34.059
of constant, unrelenting, never-ending
anxiety, uncertainty and self-doubt.

00:06:34.083 --> 00:06:37.351
And this is something
I really struggle with.

00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:39.643
But I think almost every
scientist can tell you

00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:41.643
about the time they ignored those doubts

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:43.893
and did the experiment
that would never work.

00:06:43.917 --> 00:06:45.934
And the thing is, every now and then,

00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:48.601
one of those experiments works out.

00:06:48.625 --> 00:06:51.851
The challenge we face
is that while doubt can be destructive

00:06:51.875 --> 00:06:53.476
to your mental health,

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:58.268
it's also the reason why scientific rigor
is such a potent tool for discovery.

00:06:58.292 --> 00:07:01.268
It forces us to ask
the difficult questions

00:07:01.292 --> 00:07:02.976
and repeat experiments.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.101
Nothing about that is easy.

00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:08.143
And often it becomes our responsibility

00:07:08.167 --> 00:07:13.083
to bear the burden of the hard
and sometimes heart-wrenching experiment.

00:07:13.708 --> 00:07:17.184
This ultimately leads
to the creation of new knowledge,

00:07:17.208 --> 00:07:19.351
and in some really rare cases,

00:07:19.375 --> 00:07:22.750
the type of innovation
that just might change a person's life.

00:07:24.042 --> 00:07:25.292
Thank you.
