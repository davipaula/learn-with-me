00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.135
I've spent nearly two decades

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:18.712
observing what makes people
luckier than others

00:00:18.736 --> 00:00:22.299
and trying to help people
increase their luck.

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:25.747
You see, I teach entrepreneurship,

00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:29.320
and we all know
that most new ventures fail,

00:00:29.344 --> 00:00:32.977
and innovators and entrepreneurs
need all the luck they can get.

00:00:34.026 --> 00:00:35.316
So what is luck?

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.380
Luck is defined as success or failure
apparently caused by chance.

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:43.842
Apparently.

00:00:43.866 --> 00:00:45.501
That's the operative word.

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.542
It looks like it's chance

00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:53.724
because we rarely see all the levers
that come into play to make people lucky.

00:00:53.748 --> 00:00:56.741
But I've realized, by watching so long,

00:00:56.765 --> 00:01:00.098
that luck is rarely a lightning strike,

00:01:00.122 --> 00:01:01.876
isolated and dramatic.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.815
It's much more like the wind,

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.405
blowing constantly.

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:07.998
Sometimes it's calm,

00:01:08.022 --> 00:01:10.123
and sometimes it blows in gusts,

00:01:10.147 --> 00:01:14.372
and sometimes it comes from directions
that you didn't even imagine.

00:01:14.396 --> 00:01:16.869
So how do you catch the winds of luck?

00:01:17.796 --> 00:01:20.375
It's easy, but it's not obvious.

00:01:20.845 --> 00:01:23.795
So I'm going to share
three things with you

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:29.003
that you can do to build a sail
to capture the winds of luck.

00:01:29.831 --> 00:01:31.586
The first thing you want to do

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.115
is to change your relationship
with yourself.

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:38.251
Be willing to take small risks
that get you out of your comfort zone.

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:41.671
Now, when we're children,
we do this all the time.

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:45.878
We have to do this if we're going
to learn how to walk or talk

00:01:45.902 --> 00:01:47.060
or ride a bike

00:01:47.084 --> 00:01:49.028
or even quantum mechanics. Right?

00:01:49.052 --> 00:01:51.976
We need to go from someone one week
who doesn't ride a bike

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.783
to, next week, someone who does.

00:01:53.807 --> 00:01:56.361
And this requires us to get
out of our comfort zone

00:01:56.385 --> 00:01:58.188
and take some risks.

00:01:58.212 --> 00:02:00.331
The problem is, as we get older,

00:02:00.355 --> 00:02:02.236
we rarely do this.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.507
We sort of lock down
the sense of who we are

00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:06.329
and don't stretch anymore.

00:02:06.353 --> 00:02:07.951
Now, with my students,

00:02:07.975 --> 00:02:10.831
I spend a lot of time
giving them encouragement

00:02:10.855 --> 00:02:13.363
to get out of their comfort zone
and take some risks.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.132
How do I do this?

00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:19.028
Well, I start out by having them
fill out a risk-o-meter.

00:02:19.052 --> 00:02:21.832
Now, it's basically a fun thing
we developed in our class

00:02:21.856 --> 00:02:24.886
where they map out what risks
they're willing to take.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.814
And it becomes clear very quickly to them

00:02:27.838 --> 00:02:29.914
that risk-taking is not binary.

00:02:30.422 --> 00:02:34.073
There are intellectual risks
and physical risks and financial risks

00:02:34.097 --> 00:02:38.085
and emotional risks and social risks
and ethical risks and political risks.

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.894
And once they do this, they compare
their risk profiles with others,

00:02:41.918 --> 00:02:45.220
and they quickly realize
that they're all really different.

00:02:46.186 --> 00:02:48.742
I then encourage them to stretch,

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:51.655
to take some risks that get them
out of their comfort zone.

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:55.034
For example, I might ask them
to do an intellectual risk

00:02:55.058 --> 00:02:58.122
and try to tackle a problem
they haven't tried before;

00:02:58.146 --> 00:03:02.645
or a social risk, talking to someone
sitting next to them on the train;

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:04.400
or an emotional risk,

00:03:04.424 --> 00:03:07.365
maybe telling someone
they really care about how they feel.

00:03:08.486 --> 00:03:10.931
I do this myself all the time.

00:03:11.466 --> 00:03:13.871
About a dozen years ago,
I was on an airplane,

00:03:13.895 --> 00:03:16.656
early, early morning flight
on my way to Ecuador.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.402
And normally, I would just
put on my headphones

00:03:22.426 --> 00:03:24.357
and go to sleep, wake up, do some work,

00:03:24.381 --> 00:03:26.140
but I decided to take a little risk,

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:29.022
and I started a conversation
with the man sitting next to me.

00:03:29.046 --> 00:03:32.253
I introduced myself,
and I learned that he was a publisher.

00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:35.036
Interesting.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.308
We ended up having
a fascinating conversation.

00:03:37.332 --> 00:03:40.125
I learned all about the future
of the publishing industry.

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:43.340
So about three quarters
of the way through the flight,

00:03:43.364 --> 00:03:45.145
I decided to take another risk,

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.129
and I opened up my laptop
and I shared with him a book proposal

00:03:49.153 --> 00:03:53.129
I put together for something
I was doing in my class.

00:03:53.153 --> 00:03:54.877
And he was very polite, he read it,

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.663
and he said, "You know what, Tina,
this isn't right for us,

00:03:57.687 --> 00:03:59.354
but thank you so much for sharing."

00:03:59.378 --> 00:04:01.411
It's OK. That risk didn't work out.

00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:03.201
I shut my laptop.

00:04:03.225 --> 00:04:06.226
At the end of the flight,
we exchanged contact information.

00:04:07.774 --> 00:04:10.186
A couple of months later,
I reached out to him,

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.852
and I said, "Mark, would you
like to come to my class?

00:04:12.876 --> 00:04:15.630
I'm doing a project
on reinventing the book,

00:04:15.654 --> 00:04:16.963
the future of publishing."

00:04:16.987 --> 00:04:18.845
And he said, "Great. I'd love to come."

00:04:18.869 --> 00:04:21.204
So he came to my class.
We had a great experience.

00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:23.327
A few months later, I wrote to him again.

00:04:23.351 --> 00:04:26.017
This time, I sent him
a bunch of video clips

00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:28.279
from another project my students had done.

00:04:29.128 --> 00:04:31.694
He was so intrigued

00:04:31.718 --> 00:04:33.900
by one of the projects
the students had done,

00:04:33.924 --> 00:04:35.898
he thought there might be a book in it,

00:04:35.922 --> 00:04:38.065
and he wanted to meet those students.

00:04:38.404 --> 00:04:40.587
I have to tell you,
I was a little bit hurt.

00:04:40.611 --> 00:04:41.612
(Laughter)

00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:44.661
I mean, he wanted to do a book
with my students and not with me,

00:04:44.685 --> 00:04:45.836
but OK, it's all right.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.367
So I invited him to come down,
and he and his colleagues came to Stanford

00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:52.835
and met with the students,
and afterwards, we had lunch together.

00:04:53.667 --> 00:04:55.463
And one of his editors said to me,

00:04:55.487 --> 00:04:58.288
"Hey, have you ever
considered writing a book?"

00:04:59.098 --> 00:05:00.915
I said, "Funny you should ask."

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:04.034
And I pulled out the exact same proposal

00:05:04.058 --> 00:05:07.422
that I had showed his boss a year earlier.

00:05:07.446 --> 00:05:09.866
Within two weeks, I had a contract,

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:13.771
and within two years, the book had sold
over a million copies around the world.

00:05:14.295 --> 00:05:16.381
(Applause)

00:05:16.405 --> 00:05:18.437
Now, you might say,

00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:19.810
"Oh, you're so lucky."

00:05:19.834 --> 00:05:21.105
But of course I was lucky,

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:25.453
but that luck resulted
from a series of small risks I took,

00:05:25.477 --> 00:05:27.747
starting with saying hello.

00:05:27.771 --> 00:05:30.160
And anyone can do this,

00:05:30.184 --> 00:05:31.947
no matter where you are in your life,

00:05:31.971 --> 00:05:33.831
no matter where you are in the world --

00:05:33.855 --> 00:05:37.141
even if you think
you're the most unlucky person,

00:05:37.165 --> 00:05:41.454
you can do this by taking little risks
that get you out of your comfort zone.

00:05:41.478 --> 00:05:43.807
You start building a sail to capture luck.

00:05:44.785 --> 00:05:46.528
The second thing you want to do

00:05:46.552 --> 00:05:49.261
is to change your relationship
with other people.

00:05:49.285 --> 00:05:54.651
You need to understand that everyone
who helps you on your journey

00:05:54.675 --> 00:05:58.556
is playing a huge role
in getting you to your goals.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.191
And if you don't show appreciation,

00:06:01.215 --> 00:06:03.500
not only are you not closing the loop,

00:06:03.524 --> 00:06:05.262
but you're missing an opportunity.

00:06:06.572 --> 00:06:08.604
When someone does something for you,

00:06:08.628 --> 00:06:09.890
they're taking that time

00:06:09.914 --> 00:06:13.114
that they could be spending
on themselves or someone else,

00:06:13.138 --> 00:06:15.619
and you need to acknowledge
what they're doing.

00:06:16.672 --> 00:06:20.941
Now, I run three fellowship
programs at Stanford,

00:06:20.965 --> 00:06:23.062
and they are very competitive to get into,

00:06:23.086 --> 00:06:26.327
and when I send out the letters
to those students who don't get in,

00:06:26.351 --> 00:06:29.352
I always know there are going to be
people who are disappointed.

00:06:29.376 --> 00:06:32.556
Some of the people who are disappointed
send me notes, complaining.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.183
Some of them send notes

00:06:34.207 --> 00:06:37.655
saying what could I do to make myself
more successful next time around?

00:06:37.679 --> 00:06:38.990
And every once in a while,

00:06:39.014 --> 00:06:42.353
someone sends me a note
thanking me for the opportunity.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.776
This happened about seven years ago.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.529
A young man named Brian
sent me a beautiful note saying,

00:06:47.553 --> 00:06:50.808
"I know I've been rejected
from this program twice,

00:06:50.832 --> 00:06:52.932
but I want to thank you
for the opportunity.

00:06:52.956 --> 00:06:55.603
I learned so much
through the process of applying."

00:06:56.385 --> 00:07:00.260
I was so taken by
the graciousness of his message

00:07:00.284 --> 00:07:02.370
that I invited him to come and meet me.

00:07:02.394 --> 00:07:05.181
And we spent some time chatting
and cooked up an idea

00:07:05.205 --> 00:07:07.228
for an independent study project together.

00:07:08.252 --> 00:07:10.221
He was on the football team at Stanford,

00:07:10.245 --> 00:07:14.174
and he decided to do a project
on looking at leadership in that context.

00:07:14.546 --> 00:07:18.165
We got to know each other
incredibly well through that quarter,

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:20.594
and he took the project
that he started working on

00:07:20.618 --> 00:07:21.928
in the independent study

00:07:21.952 --> 00:07:26.432
and turned it, ultimately,
into a company called Play for Tomorrow,

00:07:26.456 --> 00:07:29.427
where he teaches kids
from disadvantaged backgrounds

00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:32.257
how to, essentially,
craft the lives they dream to live.

00:07:33.329 --> 00:07:36.178
Now, the important thing about this story

00:07:36.202 --> 00:07:39.322
is that we both ended up catching
the winds of luck

00:07:39.346 --> 00:07:41.558
as a result of his thank-you note.

00:07:41.582 --> 00:07:45.097
But it was the winds
that we didn't expect in the first place.

00:07:46.325 --> 00:07:48.374
Over the course
of the last couple of years,

00:07:48.398 --> 00:07:51.406
I've come up with
some tactics for my own life

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.707
to help me really foster appreciation.

00:07:54.287 --> 00:07:57.835
My favorite is that at the end
of every single day,

00:07:57.859 --> 00:08:01.605
I look at my calendar
and I review all the people I met with,

00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:04.685
and I send thank-you notes
to every single person.

00:08:04.709 --> 00:08:06.883
It only takes a few minutes,

00:08:06.907 --> 00:08:08.686
but at the end of every day,

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.979
I feel incredibly grateful
and appreciative,

00:08:12.003 --> 00:08:14.523
and I promise you
it has increased my luck.

00:08:15.387 --> 00:08:18.986
So first, you need to take some risks
and get out of your comfort zone.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.476
Second, you need to show appreciation.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.396
And third, you want to change
your relationship with ideas.

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.698
Most people look at new ideas
that come there way and they judge them.

00:08:29.722 --> 00:08:32.478
"That's a great idea"
or "That's a terrible idea."

00:08:32.502 --> 00:08:35.486
But it's actually much more nuanced.

00:08:36.211 --> 00:08:38.058
Ideas are neither good or bad.

00:08:38.082 --> 00:08:42.888
And in fact, the seeds of terrible ideas
are often something truly remarkable.

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:47.418
One of my favorite exercises
in my classes on creativity

00:08:47.442 --> 00:08:51.504
is to help students foster an attitude
of looking at terrible ideas

00:08:51.528 --> 00:08:54.683
through the lens of possibilities.

00:08:55.337 --> 00:08:57.474
So I give them a challenge:

00:08:57.498 --> 00:09:00.723
to create an idea
for a brand new restaurant.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.174
They have to come up
with the best ideas for a new restaurant

00:09:04.198 --> 00:09:06.767
and the worst ideas for a new restaurant.

00:09:06.791 --> 00:09:10.250
So the best ideas are things like
a restaurant on a mountaintop

00:09:10.274 --> 00:09:11.809
with a beautiful sunset,

00:09:11.833 --> 00:09:14.729
or a restaurant on a boat
with a gorgeous view.

00:09:14.753 --> 00:09:19.539
And the terrible ideas are things like
a restaurant in a garbage dump,

00:09:19.563 --> 00:09:23.807
or a restaurant with terrible service
that's really dirty,

00:09:23.831 --> 00:09:27.253
or a restaurant that serves
cockroach sushi.

00:09:27.277 --> 00:09:28.601
(Laughter)

00:09:28.625 --> 00:09:30.745
So they hand all the ideas to me,

00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:33.012
I read the great ideas out loud,

00:09:33.036 --> 00:09:35.101
and then I rip them up
and throw them away.

00:09:36.593 --> 00:09:39.735
I then take the horrible ideas
and redistribute them.

00:09:40.339 --> 00:09:44.902
Each team now has an idea
that another team thought was horrible,

00:09:44.926 --> 00:09:47.743
and their challenge is to turn it
into something brilliant.

00:09:49.164 --> 00:09:50.359
Here's what happens.

00:09:51.084 --> 00:09:55.992
Within about 10 seconds, someone says,
"This is a fabulous idea."

00:09:56.016 --> 00:10:00.658
And they have about three minutes
before they pitch the idea to the class.

00:10:00.682 --> 00:10:03.969
So the restaurant in the garbage dump?
What does that turn into?

00:10:03.993 --> 00:10:08.153
Well, they collect all the extra food
from Michelin star restaurants

00:10:08.177 --> 00:10:10.481
that was going to get thrown out,

00:10:10.505 --> 00:10:13.085
and they have another restaurant
at a much lower price,

00:10:13.109 --> 00:10:14.260
with all the leftovers.

00:10:14.284 --> 00:10:15.441
Pretty cool?

00:10:15.465 --> 00:10:18.413
Or the restaurant that's dirty
with terrible service?

00:10:18.869 --> 00:10:22.588
Well, that turns into a restaurant
that's a training ground

00:10:22.612 --> 00:10:26.707
for future restauranteurs to figure out
how to avoid all the pitfalls.

00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:29.478
And the restaurant with cockroach sushi?

00:10:29.502 --> 00:10:31.632
It turns into a sushi bar

00:10:31.656 --> 00:10:34.739
with all sorts of really interesting
and exotic ingredients.

00:10:36.102 --> 00:10:39.190
If you look around at the companies,

00:10:39.214 --> 00:10:42.261
the ventures that are
really innovative around you,

00:10:42.285 --> 00:10:45.911
the ones that we now take for granted
that have changed our life,

00:10:45.935 --> 00:10:47.205
well, you know what?

00:10:47.229 --> 00:10:50.110
They all started out as crazy ideas.

00:10:50.134 --> 00:10:52.863
They started ideas
that when they pitched to other people,

00:10:52.887 --> 00:10:56.014
most people said, "That's crazy,
it will never work."

00:10:58.275 --> 00:11:04.043
So, yes, sometimes people
were born into terrible circumstances,

00:11:04.067 --> 00:11:06.352
and sometimes, luck is a lightning bolt

00:11:06.376 --> 00:11:09.336
that hits us with something wonderful
or something terrible.

00:11:10.288 --> 00:11:14.240
But the winds of luck are always there,

00:11:14.264 --> 00:11:17.319
and if you're willing to take some risks,

00:11:17.343 --> 00:11:20.851
if you're willing to really go out
and show appreciation

00:11:20.875 --> 00:11:25.296
and willing to really look at ideas,
even if they're crazy,

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.089
through the lens of possibilities,

00:11:27.113 --> 00:11:31.515
you can build a bigger and bigger sail
to catch the winds of luck.

00:11:31.872 --> 00:11:33.023
Thank you.

00:11:33.047 --> 00:11:38.095
(Applause)
