00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:13.792
I am a translator.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:17.705
I translate from biology into mathematics

00:00:17.729 --> 00:00:18.879
and vice versa.

00:00:19.588 --> 00:00:21.378
I write mathematical models

00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:24.249
which, in my case, are systems
of differential equations,

00:00:24.273 --> 00:00:26.220
to describe biological mechanisms,

00:00:26.244 --> 00:00:27.402
such as cell growth.

00:00:28.122 --> 00:00:29.970
Essentially, it works like this.

00:00:30.573 --> 00:00:33.042
First, I identify the key elements

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.843
that I believe may be driving
behavior over time

00:00:35.867 --> 00:00:37.406
of a particular mechanism.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.121
Then, I formulate assumptions

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:43.031
about how these elements
interact with each other

00:00:43.055 --> 00:00:44.392
and with their environment.

00:00:44.916 --> 00:00:46.688
It may look something like this.

00:00:46.712 --> 00:00:50.029
Then, I translate
these assumptions into equations,

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.434
which may look something like this.

00:00:53.434 --> 00:00:55.324
Finally, I analyze my equations

00:00:55.348 --> 00:00:58.449
and translate the results back
into the language of biology.

00:01:00.156 --> 00:01:02.576
A key aspect of mathematical modeling

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.508
is that we, as modelers,
do not think about what things are;

00:01:06.532 --> 00:01:08.387
we think about what they do.

00:01:08.411 --> 00:01:10.900
We think about relationships
between individuals,

00:01:10.924 --> 00:01:13.810
whether they be cells, animals or people,

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:16.882
and how they interact with each other
and with their environment.

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:18.979
Let me give you an example.

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:23.522
What do foxes and immune cells
have in common?

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:26.252
They're both predators,

00:01:26.744 --> 00:01:29.467
except foxes feed on rabbits,

00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:32.821
and immune cells feed on invaders,
such as cancer cells.

00:01:33.273 --> 00:01:35.618
But from a mathematical point of view,

00:01:35.642 --> 00:01:39.798
a qualitatively same system
of predator-prey type equations

00:01:39.822 --> 00:01:43.067
will describe interactions
between foxes and rabbits

00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:44.865
and cancer and immune cells.

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:48.317
Predator-prey type systems
have been studied extensively

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:49.610
in scientific literature,

00:01:49.634 --> 00:01:52.012
describing interactions
of two populations,

00:01:52.036 --> 00:01:54.811
where survival of one depends
on consuming the other.

00:01:55.485 --> 00:01:58.105
And these same equations
provide a framework

00:01:58.129 --> 00:02:00.440
for understanding
cancer-immune interactions,

00:02:00.464 --> 00:02:02.305
where cancer is the prey,

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.701
and the immune system is the predator.

00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:08.757
And the prey employs all sorts of tricks
to prevent the predator from killing it,

00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:10.601
ranging from camouflaging itself

00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:12.464
to stealing the predator's food.

00:02:13.352 --> 00:02:15.914
This can have some very
interesting implications.

00:02:15.938 --> 00:02:20.760
For example, despite enormous successes
in the field of immunotherapy,

00:02:20.784 --> 00:02:23.245
there still remains
somewhat limited efficacy

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.811
when it comes solid tumors.

00:02:25.423 --> 00:02:27.982
But if you think about it ecologically,

00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:30.096
both cancer and immune cells --

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.720
the prey and the predator --

00:02:31.744 --> 00:02:34.775
require nutrients
such as glucose to survive.

00:02:35.358 --> 00:02:40.147
If cancer cells outcompete
the immune cells for shared nutrients

00:02:40.171 --> 00:02:41.964
in the tumor microenvironment,

00:02:41.988 --> 00:02:45.402
then the immune cells will physically
not be able to do their job.

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:49.159
This predator-prey-shared
resource type model

00:02:49.183 --> 00:02:51.480
is something I've worked on
in my own research.

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:54.228
And it was recently shown experimentally

00:02:54.252 --> 00:02:58.306
that restoring the metabolic balance
in the tumor microenvironment --

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.861
that is, making sure
immune cells get their food --

00:03:01.885 --> 00:03:07.130
can give them, the predators, back
their edge in fighting cancer, the prey.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.779
This means that if you abstract a bit,

00:03:10.803 --> 00:03:13.758
you can think about cancer itself
as an ecosystem,

00:03:13.782 --> 00:03:18.069
where heterogeneous populations of cells
compete and cooperate

00:03:18.093 --> 00:03:20.110
for space and nutrients,

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:22.806
interact with predators --
the immune system --

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.071
migrate -- metastases --

00:03:25.095 --> 00:03:27.562
all within the ecosystem
of the human body.

00:03:28.221 --> 00:03:32.090
And what do we know about most
ecosystems from conservation biology?

00:03:32.643 --> 00:03:35.495
That one of the best ways
to extinguish species

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.471
is not to target them directly

00:03:37.495 --> 00:03:39.934
but to target their environment.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.950
And so, once we have identified
the key components

00:03:43.974 --> 00:03:45.618
of the tumor environment,

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.590
we can propose hypotheses

00:03:47.614 --> 00:03:50.908
and simulate scenarios
and therapeutic interventions

00:03:50.932 --> 00:03:54.357
all in a completely safe
and affordable way

00:03:54.381 --> 00:03:57.750
and target different components
of the microenvironment

00:03:57.774 --> 00:04:01.770
in such a way as to kill the cancer
without harming the host,

00:04:01.794 --> 00:04:03.364
such as me or you.

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:08.031
And so while the immediate
goal of my research

00:04:08.055 --> 00:04:10.321
is to advance research and innovation

00:04:10.345 --> 00:04:12.241
and to reduce its cost,

00:04:12.265 --> 00:04:14.782
the real intent, of course,
is to save lives.

00:04:15.278 --> 00:04:17.049
And that's what I try to do

00:04:17.073 --> 00:04:19.820
through mathematical modeling
applied to biology,

00:04:19.844 --> 00:04:22.315
and in particular,
to the development of drugs.

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:26.951
It's a field that until relatively
recently has remained somewhat marginal,

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:28.427
but it has matured.

00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:31.600
And there are now very well-developed
mathematical methods,

00:04:31.624 --> 00:04:33.523
a lot of preprogrammed tools,

00:04:33.547 --> 00:04:35.043
including free ones,

00:04:35.067 --> 00:04:39.114
and an ever-increasing amount
of computational power available to us.

00:04:40.718 --> 00:04:44.117
The power and beauty
of mathematical modeling

00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:46.782
lies in the fact
that it makes you formalize,

00:04:46.806 --> 00:04:48.893
in a very rigorous way,

00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:50.382
what we think we know.

00:04:50.904 --> 00:04:52.348
We make assumptions,

00:04:52.372 --> 00:04:53.940
translate them into equations,

00:04:53.964 --> 00:04:55.275
run simulations,

00:04:55.299 --> 00:04:57.072
all to answer the question:

00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:59.342
In a world where my assumptions are true,

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:00.936
what do I expect to see?

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.976
It's a pretty simple conceptual framework.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.226
It's all about asking the right questions.

00:05:06.603 --> 00:05:10.698
But it can unleash numerous opportunities
for testing biological hypotheses.

00:05:11.696 --> 00:05:14.296
If our predictions match our observations,

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.347
great! -- we got it right,
so we can make further predictions

00:05:17.371 --> 00:05:19.931
by changing this or that
aspect of the model.

00:05:20.733 --> 00:05:24.433
If, however, our predictions
do not match our observations,

00:05:24.457 --> 00:05:27.042
that means that some
of our assumptions are wrong,

00:05:27.066 --> 00:05:29.499
and so our understanding
of the key mechanisms

00:05:29.523 --> 00:05:30.962
of underlying biology

00:05:30.986 --> 00:05:32.256
is still incomplete.

00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:35.191
Luckily, since this is a model,

00:05:35.215 --> 00:05:37.104
we control all the assumptions.

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:39.268
So we can go through them, one by one,

00:05:39.292 --> 00:05:43.121
identifying which one or ones
are causing the discrepancy.

00:05:43.637 --> 00:05:46.993
And then we can fill this newly
identified gap in knowledge

00:05:47.017 --> 00:05:49.732
using both experimental
and theoretical approaches.

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.520
Of course, any ecosystem
is extremely complex,

00:05:53.544 --> 00:05:57.387
and trying to describe all the moving
parts is not only very difficult,

00:05:57.411 --> 00:05:59.073
but also not very informative.

00:05:59.518 --> 00:06:01.584
There's also the issue of timescales,

00:06:01.608 --> 00:06:05.276
because some processes take place
on a scale of seconds, some minutes,

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.248
some days, months and years.

00:06:07.272 --> 00:06:10.471
It may not always be possible
to separate those out experimentally.

00:06:11.143 --> 00:06:14.527
And some things happen
so quickly or so slowly

00:06:14.551 --> 00:06:17.271
that you may physically
never be able to measure them.

00:06:17.295 --> 00:06:19.583
But as mathematicians,

00:06:19.607 --> 00:06:25.252
we have the power to zoom in
on any subsystem in any timescale

00:06:25.276 --> 00:06:27.400
and simulate effects of interventions

00:06:27.424 --> 00:06:30.125
that take place in any timescale.

00:06:31.942 --> 00:06:34.876
Of course, this isn't the work
of a modeler alone.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.189
It has to happen in close
collaboration with biologists.

00:06:38.213 --> 00:06:41.217
And it does demand
some capacity of translation

00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:42.445
on both sides.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.338
But starting with a theoretical
formulation of a problem

00:06:47.362 --> 00:06:50.859
can unleash numerous opportunities
for testing hypotheses

00:06:50.883 --> 00:06:54.122
and simulating scenarios
and therapeutic interventions,

00:06:54.146 --> 00:06:56.216
all in a completely safe way.

00:06:56.977 --> 00:07:02.152
It can identify gaps in knowledge
and logical inconsistencies

00:07:02.176 --> 00:07:05.015
and can help guide us
as to where we should keep looking

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:06.934
and where there may be a dead end.

00:07:07.632 --> 00:07:08.879
In other words:

00:07:08.903 --> 00:07:12.397
mathematical modeling
can help us answer questions

00:07:12.421 --> 00:07:14.809
that directly affect people's health --

00:07:15.942 --> 00:07:18.646
that affect each
person's health, actually --

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.346
because mathematical modeling will be key

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.204
to propelling personalized medicine.

00:07:24.112 --> 00:07:27.179
And it all comes down
to asking the right question

00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:29.786
and translating it
to the right equation ...

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:31.820
and back.

00:07:32.533 --> 00:07:33.684
Thank you.

00:07:33.708 --> 00:07:37.007
(Applause)
