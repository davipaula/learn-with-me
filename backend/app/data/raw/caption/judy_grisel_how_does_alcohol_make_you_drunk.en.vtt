00:00:07.014 --> 00:00:12.249
Ethanol: this molecule, made of little 
more than a few carbon atoms,

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.089
is responsible for drunkenness.

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.750
Often simply referred to as alcohol,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.120
ethanol is the active ingredient 
in alcoholic beverages.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.840
Its simplicity helps it 
sneak across membranes

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.160
and nestle into a many different nooks,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.369
producing a wide range of effects 
compared to other, clunkier molecules.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.979
So how exactly does it cause drunkenness,

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:38.510
and why does it have dramatically 
different effects on different people?

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.058
To answer these questions,

00:00:40.058 --> 00:00:43.905
we’ll need to follow alcohol 
on its journey through the body.

00:00:43.905 --> 00:00:47.293
Alcohol lands in the stomach 
and is absorbed into the blood

00:00:47.293 --> 00:00:51.300
through the digestive tract,
especially the small intestine.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.820
The contents of the stomach 
impact alcohol’s ability

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.563
to get into the blood because 
after eating, the pyloric sphincter,

00:00:57.563 --> 00:01:01.231
which separates the stomach 
from the small intestine, closes.

00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:04.443
So the level of alcohol that reaches 
the blood after a big meal

00:01:04.443 --> 00:01:09.066
might only be a quarter that
from the same drink on an empty stomach.

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:11.756
From the blood, 
alcohol goes to the organs,

00:01:11.756 --> 00:01:14.073
especially those that get 
the most blood flow:

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:16.673
the liver and the brain.

00:01:16.673 --> 00:01:19.583
It hits the liver first, 
and enzymes in the liver

00:01:19.583 --> 00:01:22.953
break down the alcohol molecule 
in two steps.

00:01:22.953 --> 00:01:29.427
First, an enzyme called ADH turns alcohol 
into acetaldehyde, which is toxic.

00:01:29.427 --> 00:01:36.090
Then, an enzyme called ALDH converts the 
toxic acetaldehyde to non-toxic acetate.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.210
As the blood circulates, the liver 
eliminates alcohol continuously—

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.026
but this first pass of elimination 
determines how much alcohol

00:01:44.026 --> 00:01:47.269
reaches the brain and other organs.

00:01:47.269 --> 00:01:51.199
Brain sensitivity is responsible 
for the emotional, cognitive,

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:56.623
and behavioral effects of alcohol— 
otherwise known as drunkenness.

00:01:56.623 --> 00:02:01.360
Alcohol turns up the brain’s 
primary brake, the neurotransmitter GABA,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.081
and turns down its primary gas, 
the neurotransmitter glutamate.

00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:08.631
This makes neurons 
much less communicative,

00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:13.375
and users feel relaxed at moderate doses, 
fall asleep at higher doses,

00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:19.330
and can impede the brain activity 
necessary for survival at toxic doses.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.100
Alcohol also stimulates 
a small group of neurons

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.574
that extends from the midbrain 
to the nucleus accumbens,

00:02:25.574 --> 00:02:28.164
a region important for motivation.

00:02:28.164 --> 00:02:29.854
Like all addictive drugs,

00:02:29.854 --> 00:02:32.944
it prompts a squirt of dopamine 
in the nucleus accumbens

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:36.004
which gives users a surge of pleasure.

00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:40.746
Alcohol also causes some neurons 
to synthesize and release endorphins.

00:02:40.746 --> 00:02:44.566
Endorphins help us to calm down 
in response to stress or danger.

00:02:44.566 --> 00:02:47.354
Elevated levels of endorphins 
contribute to the euphoria

00:02:47.354 --> 00:02:51.104
and relaxation associated 
with alcohol consumption.

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:51.970
Finally,

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.776
as the liver’s breakdown of alcohol 
outpaces the brain’s absorption,

00:02:55.776 --> 00:02:58.006
drunkenness fades away.

00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:00.616
Individual differences 
at any point in this journey

00:03:00.616 --> 00:03:03.966
can cause people 
to act more or less drunk.

00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:07.846
For example, a man and a woman who weigh 
the same and drink the same amount

00:03:07.846 --> 00:03:12.781
during an identical meal will still have 
different blood alcohol concentrations,

00:03:12.781 --> 00:03:14.731
or BACs.

00:03:14.731 --> 00:03:17.656
This is because women 
tend to have less blood—

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:20.056
women generally have 
a higher percentage of fat,

00:03:20.056 --> 00:03:22.466
which requires less blood than muscle.

00:03:22.466 --> 00:03:25.816
A smaller blood volume, 
carrying the same amount of alcohol,

00:03:25.816 --> 00:03:29.356
means the concentration 
will be higher for women.

00:03:29.356 --> 00:03:34.908
Genetic differences in the liver’s alcohol
processing enzymes also influence BAC.

00:03:34.908 --> 00:03:37.938
And regular drinking can 
increase production of these enzymes,

00:03:37.938 --> 00:03:40.103
contributing to tolerance.

00:03:40.103 --> 00:03:43.693
On the other hand, those who drink 
excessively for a long time

00:03:43.693 --> 00:03:48.252
may develop liver damage,
which has the opposite effect.

00:03:48.252 --> 00:03:52.092
Meanwhile, genetic differences 
in dopamine, GABA,

00:03:52.092 --> 00:03:54.723
and endorphin transmission 
may contribute to risk

00:03:54.723 --> 00:03:57.743
for developing an alcohol use disorder.

00:03:57.743 --> 00:04:01.253
Those with naturally low endorphin 
or dopamine levels may self-medicate

00:04:01.253 --> 00:04:02.574
through drinking.

00:04:02.574 --> 00:04:05.183
Some people have a higher risk 
for excessive drinking

00:04:05.183 --> 00:04:08.873
due to a sensitive endorphin response 
that increases the pleasurable effects

00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:10.243
of alcohol.

00:04:10.243 --> 00:04:12.803
Others have a variation 
in GABA transmission

00:04:12.803 --> 00:04:16.593
that makes them especially sensitive 
to the sedative effects of alcohol,

00:04:16.593 --> 00:04:20.873
which decreases their risk of developing 
disordered drinking.

00:04:20.873 --> 00:04:25.575
Meanwhile, the brain adapts to chronic 
alcohol consumption by reducing GABA,

00:04:25.575 --> 00:04:30.423
dopamine, and endorphin transmission, 
and enhancing glutamate activity.

00:04:30.423 --> 00:04:34.413
This means regular drinkers tend 
to be anxious, have trouble sleeping,

00:04:34.413 --> 00:04:37.513
and experience less pleasure.

00:04:37.513 --> 00:04:41.103
These structural and functional changes 
can lead to disordered use

00:04:41.103 --> 00:04:45.053
when drinking feels normal, 
but not drinking is uncomfortable,

00:04:45.053 --> 00:04:47.587
establishing a vicious cycle.

00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:53.333
So both genetics and previous experience 
impact how a person experiences alcohol—

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:55.543
which means that some people 
are more prone

00:04:55.543 --> 00:04:58.247
to certain patterns 
of drinking than others,

00:04:58.247 --> 00:05:02.847
and a history of consumption leads 
to neural and behavioral changes.
