00:00:07.993 --> 00:00:11.142
Has anyone ever told you,
"Stand up straight!"

00:00:11.142 --> 00:00:14.762
or scolded you for slouching
at a family dinner?

00:00:14.762 --> 00:00:18.644
Comments like that might be annoying,
but they're not wrong.

00:00:18.644 --> 00:00:22.883
Your posture, the way you hold your body
when you're sitting or standing,

00:00:22.883 --> 00:00:26.126
is the foundation for every movement
your body makes,

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:30.597
and can determine how well your body
adapts to the stresses on it.

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:33.589
These stresses can be things 
like carrying weight,

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:35.766
or sitting in an awkward position.

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:41.292
And the big one we all experience 
all day every day: gravity.

00:00:41.292 --> 00:00:42.926
If your posture isn't optimal,

00:00:42.926 --> 00:00:46.916
your muscles have to work harder
to keep you upright and balanced.

00:00:46.916 --> 00:00:49.651
Some muscles will become tight
and inflexbile.

00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:51.691
Others will be inhibited.

00:00:51.691 --> 00:00:54.487
Over time, these dysfunctional adaptations

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:58.882
impair your body's ability 
to deal with the forces on it.

00:00:58.882 --> 00:01:02.967
Poor posture inflicts extra wear and tear
on your joints and ligaments,

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:05.441
increases the likelihood of accidents,

00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:09.582
and makes some organs, 
like your lungs, less efficient.

00:01:09.582 --> 00:01:12.277
Researchers have linked 
poor posture to scoliosis,

00:01:12.277 --> 00:01:13.877
tension headaches,

00:01:13.877 --> 00:01:15.164
and back pain,

00:01:15.164 --> 00:01:18.660
though it isn't the exclusive 
cause of any of them.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.679
Posture can even influence 
your emotional state

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:23.997
and your sensitivity to pain.

00:01:23.997 --> 00:01:27.781
So there are a lot of reasons
to aim for good posture.

00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:29.643
But it's getting harder these days.

00:01:29.643 --> 00:01:33.889
Sitting in an awkward position 
for a long time can promote poor posture,

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:37.004
and so can using computers 
or mobile devices,

00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:39.279
which encourage you to look downward.

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:43.873
Many studies suggest that, on average,
posture is getting worse.

00:01:43.873 --> 00:01:46.247
So what does good posture look like?

00:01:46.247 --> 00:01:48.877
When you look at the spine 
from the front or the back,

00:01:48.877 --> 00:01:53.429
all 33 vertebrae should appear stacked
in a straight line.

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.226
From the side, the spine
should have three curves:

00:01:56.226 --> 00:02:01.170
one at your neck, one at your shoulders,
and one at the small of your back.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.483
You aren't born with this s-shaped spine.

00:02:03.483 --> 00:02:06.789
Babies' spines just have one curve like a "c."

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.398
The other curves usually develop
by 12-18 months

00:02:10.398 --> 00:02:12.827
as the muscles strengthen.

00:02:12.827 --> 00:02:16.323
These curves help us stay upright
and absorb some of the stress

00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:19.406
from activities like walking and jumping.

00:02:19.406 --> 00:02:20.950
If they are aligned properly,

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.097
when you're standing up,

00:02:22.097 --> 00:02:24.301
you should be able to draw a straight line

00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:26.453
from a point just in front 
of your shoulders,

00:02:26.453 --> 00:02:27.813
to behind your hip,

00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:29.449
to the front of your knee,

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.344
to a few inches in front of your ankle.

00:02:32.344 --> 00:02:36.098
This keeps your center of gravity
directly over your base of support,

00:02:36.098 --> 00:02:38.209
which allows you to move efficiently

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.006
with the least amount of fatigue
and muscle strain.

00:02:41.006 --> 00:02:43.735
If you're sitting, 
your neck should be vertical,

00:02:43.735 --> 00:02:45.444
not tilted forward.

00:02:45.444 --> 00:02:49.295
Your shoulders should be relaxed
with your arms close to your trunk.

00:02:49.295 --> 00:02:53.663
Your knees should be at a right angle
with your feet flat on the floor.

00:02:53.663 --> 00:02:56.449
But what if your posture isn't that great?

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:59.279
Try redesigning your environment.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:03.744
Adjust your screen so it's at
or slightly below eyelevel.

00:03:03.744 --> 00:03:05.540
Make sure all parts of your body,

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.815
like your elbows and wrists, 
are supported,

00:03:08.815 --> 00:03:11.512
using ergonomic aids if you need to.

00:03:11.512 --> 00:03:14.009
Try sleeping on your side
with your neck supported

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:16.584
and with a pillow between your legs.

00:03:16.584 --> 00:03:20.079
Wear shoes with low heels
and good arch support,

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.332
and use a headset for phone calls.

00:03:22.332 --> 00:03:25.761
It's also not enough 
to just have good posture.

00:03:25.761 --> 00:03:30.197
Keeping your muscles and joints moving
is extremely important.

00:03:30.197 --> 00:03:34.440
In fact, being stationary for long periods
with good posture

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.773
can be worse than regular movement
with bad posture.

00:03:38.773 --> 00:03:41.084
When you do move, move smartly.

00:03:41.084 --> 00:03:43.930
Keep anything you're carrying
close to your body.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.653
Backpacks should be in contact 
with your back carried symetrically.

00:03:48.653 --> 00:03:52.384
If you sit a lot, get up and move around
on occassion,

00:03:52.384 --> 00:03:54.559
and be sure to exercise.

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:58.384
Using your muscles will keep them
strong enough to support you effectively,

00:03:58.384 --> 00:04:03.970
on top of all the other benefits 
to your joints, bones, brain and heart.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.178
And if you're really worried,
check with a physical therapist,

00:04:07.178 --> 00:04:10.552
because yes, 
you really should stand up straight.
