00:00:06.983 --> 00:00:11.265
A handful of species on Earth 
share a seemingly mysterious trait:

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:13.132
a menstrual cycle.

00:00:13.132 --> 00:00:15.152
We're one of the select few.

00:00:15.152 --> 00:00:19.545
Monkeys, apes, bats, humans,
and possibly elephant shrews

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:22.998
are the only mammals on Earth
that menstruate.

00:00:22.998 --> 00:00:25.426
We also do it more than any other animal,

00:00:25.426 --> 00:00:29.509
even though its a waste of nutrients
and can be a physical inconvenience.

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.649
So where's the sense in this
uncommon biological process?

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.968
The answer begins with pregnancy.

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:39.563
During this process, the body's resources
are cleverly used to shape

00:00:39.563 --> 00:00:42.297
a suitable environment for a fetus,

00:00:42.297 --> 00:00:46.920
creating an internal haven for a mother
to nurture her growing child.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.427
In this respect, 
pregnancy is awe-inspiring,

00:00:50.427 --> 00:00:53.312
but that's only half the story.

00:00:53.312 --> 00:00:58.294
The other half reveals that pregnancy
places a mother and her child at odds.

00:00:58.294 --> 00:01:00.193
As for all living creatures,

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:03.787
the human body evolved to promote
the spread of its genes.

00:01:03.787 --> 00:01:06.805
For the mother, that means
she should try to provide equally

00:01:06.805 --> 00:01:09.048
for all her offspring.

00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:13.042
But a mother and her fetus don't share
exactly the same genes.

00:01:13.042 --> 00:01:15.672
The fetus inherits genes
from its father, as well,

00:01:15.672 --> 00:01:19.201
and those genes can promote their own
survival by extracting

00:01:19.201 --> 00:01:23.065
more than their fair share 
of resources from the mother.

00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:25.005
This evolutionary conflict of interests

00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:28.735
places a woman and her unborn child
in a biological tug-of-war

00:01:28.735 --> 00:01:32.372
that plays out inside the womb.

00:01:32.372 --> 00:01:35.249
One factor contributing 
to this internal tussle

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:39.488
is the placenta, the fetal organ that
connects to the mother's blood supply

00:01:39.488 --> 00:01:42.129
and nourishes the fetus while it grows.

00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:47.777
In most mammals, the placenta is confined
behind a barrier of maternal cells.

00:01:47.777 --> 00:01:52.349
This barrier lets the mother control
the supply of nutrients to the fetus.

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:54.503
But in humans and a few other species,

00:01:54.503 --> 00:01:58.731
the placenta actually penetrates right
into the mother's circulatory system

00:01:58.731 --> 00:02:01.716
to directly access her blood stream.

00:02:01.716 --> 00:02:05.323
Through its placenta, the fetus
pumps the mother's arteries with hormones

00:02:05.323 --> 00:02:10.548
that keep them open to provide a permanent
flow of nutrient-rich blood.

00:02:10.548 --> 00:02:14.386
A fetus with such unrestricted access
can manufacture hormones

00:02:14.386 --> 00:02:17.796
to increase the mother's blood sugar,
dilate her arteries,

00:02:17.796 --> 00:02:20.815
and inflate her blood pressure.

00:02:20.815 --> 00:02:25.676
Most mammal mothers can expel
or reabsorb embryos if required,

00:02:25.676 --> 00:02:29.326
but in humans, once the fetus is
connected to the blood supply,

00:02:29.326 --> 00:02:33.252
severing that connection 
can result in hemorrhage.

00:02:33.252 --> 00:02:35.585
If the fetus develops poorly or dies,

00:02:35.585 --> 00:02:38.581
the mother's health is endangered.

00:02:38.581 --> 00:02:43.397
As it grows, a fetus's ongoing need
for resources can cause intense fatigue,

00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:45.138
high blood pressure,

00:02:45.138 --> 00:02:49.022
and conditions 
like diabetes and preeclampsia.

00:02:49.022 --> 00:02:50.465
Because of these risks,

00:02:50.465 --> 00:02:55.814
pregnancy is always a huge, 
and sometimes dangerous, investment.

00:02:55.814 --> 00:02:59.122
So it makes sense that the body 
should screen embryos carefully

00:02:59.122 --> 00:03:01.551
to find out which ones 
are worth the challenge.

00:03:01.551 --> 00:03:04.059
This is where menstruation fits in.

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.889
Pregnancy starts with a process
called implantation,

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:12.049
where the embryo embeds itself
in the endometrium that lines the uterus.

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:15.234
The endometrium evolved to make
implantation difficult

00:03:15.234 --> 00:03:19.084
so that only the healthy embryos
could survive.

00:03:19.084 --> 00:03:20.560
But in doing so,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.223
it also selected for the most 
vigorously invasive embryos,

00:03:24.223 --> 00:03:28.239
creating an evolutionary feedback loop.

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.811
The embryo engages in a complex,
exquisitely timed hormonal dialogue

00:03:32.811 --> 00:03:37.560
that transforms the endometrium 
to allow implantation.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.613
What happens when 
an embryo fails the test?

00:03:40.613 --> 00:03:42.755
It might still manage to attach,

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:45.764
or even get partly 
through the endometrium.

00:03:45.764 --> 00:03:49.524
As it slowly dies, it could leave 
its mother vulnerable to infection,

00:03:49.524 --> 00:03:55.849
and all the time, it may be emitting
hormonal signals that disrupt her tissues.

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.832
The body avoids this problem
by simply removing every possible risk.

00:04:00.832 --> 00:04:04.594
Each time ovulation doesn't result
in a healthy pregnancy,

00:04:04.594 --> 00:04:07.779
the womb gets rid 
of its endometrial lining,

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:12.816
along with any unfertilized eggs,
sick, dying, or dead embryos.

00:04:12.816 --> 00:04:16.127
That protective process 
is known as menstruation,

00:04:16.127 --> 00:04:19.109
leading to the period.

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.316
This biological trait, 
bizarre as it may be,

00:04:22.316 --> 00:04:26.621
sets us on course 
for the continuation of the human race.
