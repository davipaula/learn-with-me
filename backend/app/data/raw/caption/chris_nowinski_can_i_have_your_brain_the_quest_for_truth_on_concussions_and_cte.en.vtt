00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.856
I'm Chris Nowinski, and odds are
if you've met me in the last five years

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.216
I've asked you, after a few minutes,
a bit of an odd question:

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.440
Can I have your brain?

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.776
Now, it only seems like a strange question
if you don't know my story

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.480
so please let me share it with you.

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.496
I grew up outside of Chicago,
and I was an athlete

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.160
and I was very lucky to get recruited
to play football at Harvard University.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.536
So that's me.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.176
And then after graduating,
like most Harvard graduates,

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.536
I decided I wanted to join the WWE.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.776
So that's also me.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.216
(Laughter)

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.936
Sure you remember me
from Monday Night Raw in 2002 and 2003,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.416
and I had a blast

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.976
playing what people
affectionately like to call

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.176
Chris Harvard, the Ivy League snob.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.976
(Laughter)

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.296
It was perfect for me.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.416
But unfortunately,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.296
I got kicked in the head
by my colleague Bubba Ray Dudley,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.296
and I suffered a severe concussion.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.656
And it led to what became
permanent postconcussion symptoms:

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.336
constant headaches, inability to sleep,
depression, feeling in a fog.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.616
And in that first year,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.096
I tried to figure out
how could I make this pain go away.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.736
And I wasn't getting
the answers I needed from doctors,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.416
and so I started digging
into the medical literature.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.016
And I found there's
this whole story about concussions

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.696
that we weren't really being told.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.576
So I decided to write a book about it,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.936
called "Head Games:
Football's Concussion Crisis"

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.176
that came out in 2006.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.496
But in that process, I learned
it's not really just about concussions.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.736
I learned about a disease called
chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.896
What we used to call punch-drunk,
because we only knew about it from boxers.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.536
We knew that getting hit in the head
too many times with boxers

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.656
would cause their brain to essentially
start to rot, to degenerate.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.896
And they'd have symptoms

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.336
like memory problems
and problems with cognition,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.640
depression, impulse
control issues, aggression.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.640
So basically, I got ...

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.336
I got injured at the right time,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.896
in which the first two NFL players
were studied for this disease.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.656
And it turned out they both had it.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.496
The first was Mike Webster,
50 years old, already had dementia.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.400
The second, Terry Long,
45 years old when he took his life.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.216
The medical examiner in Pittsburgh
decided to look at their brains

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.776
and found this disease.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.576
I wrote a chapter about it,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.096
and I thought people would make
a big deal out of it.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.176
But shockingly, even when
the first two cases came in positive,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.176
there was never a national
news story about this,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.056
what's going on in football
with these cases of CTE.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.296
So the book comes out,

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.936
not a whole lot is happening,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.416
and one day I read the newspaper --
November 20, 2006.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.056
I find out that Andre Waters
just took his life.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.616
Those of you who know football,

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.736
Andre Waters was someone
I grew up watching.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.736
Former Philadelphia Eagles strong safety,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.536
[44] years old,
a Division II football coach

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.520
when he decided to put a gun to his head.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.256
In the article they reminded me,
his nickname was Dirty Waters.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.176
He was known for leading with his head,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.056
so I thought I'm just going to look up

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.256
did he ever talk
about the concussions he had.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.576
And I found a quote from 1994
where Andre Waters said,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.056
"I stopped counting my concussions at 15.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.776
I wouldn't say anything, I'd just sniff
smelling salts and go back out there."

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.416
And I thought, I wonder
if he might have CTE, too.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.336
If that might have contributed to whatever
made him choose to end his life.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.896
So I ended up calling the doctor
who did the first two studies, and I said,

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.336
"Hey, I think you should
study Andre Waters."

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.176
And he said, "I'd be happy to.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.696
The problem is, the first two cases
died in the county in which I work,

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.736
and I could study them as part of my job.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.696
I can't do that with Andre Waters,
he died in Florida.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.696
If you want me to study him,
you're going to have to figure out

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.736
how to get me the brain."

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.976
So I said, "OK.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.720
How does one get a brain?"

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.296
(Laughter)

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.376
So I racked my brain

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.856
and I thought, why don't I call
the medical examiner

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.616
who I think has the brain right now?

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.416
So I called up the medical examiner
in Florida, and I said,

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.416
"Hey, you don't know me, but do you still
have the brain of Andre Waters?"

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.896
(Laughter)

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.216
And he said, "Yes, I do."

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.296
I said, "OK, are you going to
study him for CTE?"

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.416
And he said no, in fact at that time
he didn't believe that was a real disease.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.120
I said, "OK, if you're not,
do you mind if I have it?"

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.736
And he said, "Well, young man,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.256
I can't give you the brain.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.896
You need his family's permission.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.176
But if you do get the permission
of his next of kin,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.880
I will release the brain to you."

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.376
And I said, "Great!"

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.056
And then I realized I had to figure out
who his next of kin was and ask them,

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.880
and it turned out it was
Andre Waters's 88-year-old mother.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.096
And I sat there, and I took
a breath and I thought,

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.336
"Am I really going to cold-call
an 88-year-old grieving mother

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.200
who just lost her son to suicide?"

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.856
And almost everything in me
said, "Don't do it.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.256
It's too much to put
this poor woman through,

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.416
she's been through so much already."

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.696
But then this other voice in my head said,

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.976
"You know what?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.816
If guys are killing themselves
from this disease

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.776
and we could study it to maybe
prevent this from happening in the future,

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.376
sometimes you've just got to suck it up
and do something that's very hard."

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.600
So I called her.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.336
First time, nobody answered.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.296
Second time, no one answered,
third... no voice mails.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.736
The fifth time, I got an answer.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.296
And thank God that Andre Waters's family
was so gracious about the call and said,

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.936
"You know what, we want to know
what happened to Andre.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.496
We want to know why he changed so much
in the last five years of his life."

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.976
And so we studied the brain,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.176
and it turned out that he did have CTE.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.016
He became the third NFL player
diagnosed with the disease.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.616
This is what it looks like.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.816
He was somewhere between mild and severe.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.976
OK, we have three
of three NFL players here.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.696
Maybe this needs to get
a little bit more serious.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.336
Maybe something's happening here.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.016
So I ended up starting
the Concussion Legacy Foundation,

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.456
actually formalized the work,

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.816
so it wasn't just
some guy calling for brains.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.440
And I searched the world.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.536
And I put together
the best research team I could find.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.456
So we partnered with Boston University,

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.576
we partnered with scientists
at the VA here in Boston,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.976
and we started a brain bank.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.336
Turns out, if you want to know
how to cure degenerative brain disease,

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.736
you have to start
by actually studying the brains.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.016
At this point, we were the first center
in the world focused on CTE.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.976
It just had not been studied formally.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.536
And so we start this brain bank,
and it's my job to get the brains

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.656
for Dr. Ann McKee
and her brain bank, right in the middle.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.976
We also work with Dr. Bob Stern,
Dr. Robert Cantu,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.496
truly my dream team
of scientists that I support.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.336
So my job is to get the brains.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.856
And I was very successful
in those early years.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.816
Since 2007 I've started every day
by reading the obituaries.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.656
And it's a tough way to live.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.056
And it's hard on me

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.096
and it's even worse on these
poor families that I've been calling

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.176
for the last 10 years,
to ask for their brains.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.576
And so early on in the process,
as it started to really eat away at me,

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.576
I decided, you know what,
can I find another way

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.656
to get people to donate
their brains to this research?

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.136
And I figured out,
what if we could create a culture

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.816
of brain donation in this country?

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.416
What if it became normal for athletes
to donate their brain after they died?

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.096
And so what I started
was a brain donation registry.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.176
And I started asking athletes

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.056
if they would publicly pledge
to donate their brain to science.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.656
And it started with, actually,
a hockey player in 2009.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.096
One of my first pledges
was a former Harvard hockey player,

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.776
Noah Welch, who was
in the NHL at the time.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.696
It was a slow start people understanding
what this was about.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.456
So when the news hit the front page,

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.496
"Noah Welch pledging
his brain to science,"

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.776
he said he went
to the locker room the next day,

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.016
one of his teammates
pulled him aside and said,

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.536
"Hey, I heard you're donating
your brain to science."

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.776
And he said, "Yep."

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.576
And he said, "Wow.
How many games are you going to miss?"

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.376
(Laughter)

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.616
True story.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.200
(Laughter)

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.016
But we've been remarkably successful --

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.496
over 2,500 athletes have signed up.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.856
They get a brain-donation card
they keep in their wallet.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.600
This is mine, I was
obviously first, it says 01.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.096
And I will donate my brain to this.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.856
We've also been lucky
to have people like Brandi Chastain,

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.135
the women's soccer icon,

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:46.535
NASCAR's Dale Earnhardt Jr.

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:48.936
Just two weeks ago,
Hall-of-Famer Nick Buoniconti

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.176
who had been diagnosed with dementia,
signed up to pledge his brain.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.655
So it's been wonderful,
and the great thing about it

00:08:54.679 --> 00:08:58.416
is that it has worked
in changing how we're able to get brains.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.416
So now, instead of me having to call,
more families call us.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.456
And our phones ring off the hook.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.576
And so I can now focus
on taking this information,

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.296
figuring out how do we work
towards a cure,

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.176
how do we work towards prevention,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.776
and so my life has gotten a lot easier.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.776
This is just some of the headlines
that we've able to get over the years

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.480
from athletes pledging their brain.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.216
The problem has been what we learned.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.456
So when we started this,

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.776
only 45 cases existed
in the world of this disease

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.016
that had been studied in brain banks.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.296
Since then, we have acquired 500 brains

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.016
and found over 300 of them had CTE.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.336
To put that in perspective,

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.080
the rest of the world has not studied
100 brains since we started this.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.136
What we've seen though
is very frightening.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.976
So some of you might have seen
the headline in July

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.856
in the "New York Times."

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.456
And a recent study we published,

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.616
that of the first 111
NFL players we looked at

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.080
110 were positive for this disease.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.216
Of the first 53 college
football players we looked at,

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.160
48 had this disease.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.656
That's something
that's a very big concern to me.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.736
And so now, I'm very much focused

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.480
on what can we do
to actually treat this disease?

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.656
We still can't diagnose
CTE in living people,

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.736
we have no treatments
that are going to be coming

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.496
out of the pharmaceutical industry
in the next five years.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.576
This is a long, long fight.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.296
But our Concussion Legacy Foundation
is here to not only facilitate this work,

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.536
and that's the long game,

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.799
but the short game is,
hey, we can prevent this.

00:10:33.823 --> 00:10:35.136
We can prevent this disease

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.736
if we just stopped hitting people
in the head so much.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.616
And frankly, we need to stop
hitting children in the head.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.816
Turns out, it's not a great idea
to hit a five-year-old in the head

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.056
500 times each year.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.816
And it does actually
open up the door to this disease.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.600
And so, we've got
a lot of work ahead of us.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.120
But I have great hope that we're
on our way to curing this disease.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.976
But I hope you understand
my story a little more now.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.096
And now that we've gotten
to know each other a little bit better,

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.376
this is the time where I ask you,

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.016
"Can I have your brain?"

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.416
Thank you very much.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.376
(Applause)

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.616
Thank you.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.480
(Applause)
