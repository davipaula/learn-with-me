00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.527
I am an astrodynamicist --

00:00:15.551 --> 00:00:19.011
you know, like that guy Rich Purnell
in the movie "The Martian."

00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:25.762
And it's my job to study and predict
motion of objects in space.

00:00:27.172 --> 00:00:32.924
Currently we track about one percent
of hazardous objects on orbit --

00:00:33.714 --> 00:00:36.831
hazardous to services like location,

00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:39.205
agriculture, banking,

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:41.196
television and communications,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.086
and soon -- very soon --

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.783
even the internet itself.

00:00:45.892 --> 00:00:52.089
Now these services are not protected
from, roughly, half a million objects

00:00:52.113 --> 00:00:54.233
the size of a speck of paint

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.210
all the way to a school bus in size.

00:00:58.398 --> 00:01:00.272
A speck of paint,

00:01:00.296 --> 00:01:03.151
traveling at the right speed,

00:01:03.175 --> 00:01:04.733
impacting one of these objects,

00:01:04.757 --> 00:01:06.976
could render it absolutely useless.

00:01:08.394 --> 00:01:12.319
But we can't track things
as small as a speck of paint.

00:01:12.694 --> 00:01:16.858
We can only track things
as small as say, a smartphone.

00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:22.471
So of this half million objects
that we should be concerned about,

00:01:22.495 --> 00:01:26.652
we can only track
about 26,000 of these objects.

00:01:26.676 --> 00:01:32.318
And of these 26,000,
only 2,000 actually work.

00:01:33.805 --> 00:01:34.955
Everything else

00:01:35.764 --> 00:01:36.914
is garbage.

00:01:38.481 --> 00:01:39.849
That's a lot of garbage.

00:01:40.227 --> 00:01:42.155
To make things a little bit worse,

00:01:43.356 --> 00:01:47.425
most of what we launch into orbit
never comes back.

00:01:49.496 --> 00:01:52.107
We send the satellite in orbit,

00:01:52.131 --> 00:01:55.099
it stops working, it runs out of fuel,

00:01:55.123 --> 00:01:57.758
and we send something else up ...

00:01:57.782 --> 00:02:00.147
and then we send up something else ...

00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:01.662
and then something else.

00:02:01.686 --> 00:02:03.215
And every once in a while,

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:05.769
two of these things
will collide with each other

00:02:05.793 --> 00:02:07.564
or one of these things will explode,

00:02:07.588 --> 00:02:08.783
or even worse,

00:02:08.807 --> 00:02:12.492
somebody might just happen to destroy
one of their satellites on orbit,

00:02:13.595 --> 00:02:17.254
and this generates many, many more pieces,

00:02:17.278 --> 00:02:19.880
most of which also never come back.

00:02:20.748 --> 00:02:24.508
Now these things are not
just randomly scattered in orbit.

00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:28.960
It turns out that given
the curvature of space-time,

00:02:28.984 --> 00:02:30.946
there are ideal locations

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.956
where we put some of these satellites --

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.731
think of these as space highways.

00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:39.233
Very much like highways on earth,

00:02:39.257 --> 00:02:43.976
these space highways can only take up
a maximum capacity of traffic

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.780
to sustain space-safe operations.

00:02:49.014 --> 00:02:51.350
Unlike highways on earth,

00:02:51.374 --> 00:02:53.586
there are actually no space traffic rules.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.543
None whatsoever, OK?

00:02:57.662 --> 00:02:58.812
Wow.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.395
What could possibly go wrong with that?

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:03.786
(Laughter)

00:03:04.482 --> 00:03:06.797
Now, what would be really nice

00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:10.459
is if we had something
like a space traffic map,

00:03:10.483 --> 00:03:13.506
like a Waze for space that I could look up

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.297
and see what the current
traffic conditions are in space,

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:17.755
maybe even predict these.

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:19.882
The problem with that, however,

00:03:19.906 --> 00:03:23.268
is that ask five different people,

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:25.740
"What's going on in orbit?

00:03:25.764 --> 00:03:26.979
Where are things going?"

00:03:27.003 --> 00:03:29.676
and you're probably going to get
10 different answers.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.082
Why is that?

00:03:31.106 --> 00:03:35.916
It's because information about things
on orbit is not commonly shared either.

00:03:37.187 --> 00:03:39.682
So what if we had a globally accessible,

00:03:39.706 --> 00:03:43.054
open and transparent
space traffic information system

00:03:43.078 --> 00:03:46.093
that can inform the public
of where everything is located

00:03:46.117 --> 00:03:49.097
to try to keep space safe and sustainable?

00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:52.725
And what if the system could be used

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:55.726
to form evidence-based
norms of behavior --

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.322
these space traffic rules?

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.989
So I developed ASTRIAGraph,

00:04:00.013 --> 00:04:03.778
the world's first crowdsourced,
space traffic monitoring system

00:04:03.802 --> 00:04:05.596
at the University of Texas at Austin.

00:04:06.694 --> 00:04:11.976
ASTRIAGraph combines multiple sources
of information from around the globe --

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.917
government, industry and academia --

00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:17.958
and represents this in a common framework
that anybody can access today.

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:23.759
Here, you can see 26,000 objects
orbiting the earth,

00:04:23.783 --> 00:04:25.612
multiple opinions,

00:04:25.636 --> 00:04:28.109
and it gets updated in near real time.

00:04:28.447 --> 00:04:32.053
But back to my problem
of space traffic map:

00:04:32.077 --> 00:04:35.446
What if you only had information
from the US government?

00:04:36.018 --> 00:04:39.392
Well, in that case, that's what
your space traffic map would look like.

00:04:39.989 --> 00:04:42.379
But what do the Russians think?

00:04:45.343 --> 00:04:47.293
That looks significantly different.

00:04:47.881 --> 00:04:50.034
Who's right? Who's wrong?

00:04:50.058 --> 00:04:51.463
What should I believe?

00:04:51.487 --> 00:04:52.847
What could I trust?

00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:54.335
This is part of the issue.

00:04:55.864 --> 00:05:02.641
In the absence of this framework
to monitor space-actor behavior,

00:05:03.421 --> 00:05:05.694
to monitor activity in space --

00:05:05.718 --> 00:05:07.469
where these objects are located --

00:05:07.493 --> 00:05:10.430
to reconcile these inconsistencies

00:05:10.454 --> 00:05:12.910
and make this knowledge commonplace,

00:05:12.934 --> 00:05:16.555
we actually risk losing the ability

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.626
to use space for humanity's benefit.

00:05:22.393 --> 00:05:23.552
Thank you very much.

00:05:23.576 --> 00:05:28.206
(Applause and cheers)
