00:00:12.786 --> 00:00:14.547
It's 2008,

00:00:14.571 --> 00:00:18.071
and I'm just finishing
my first year of design school.

00:00:19.074 --> 00:00:21.931
And I'm at my first year-end review,

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:28.822
which is a form of ritual torture
for design students,

00:00:28.846 --> 00:00:32.569
where they make you take everything
you made over the course of the year

00:00:32.593 --> 00:00:34.933
and lay it out on a table

00:00:34.957 --> 00:00:37.818
and stand next to it
while a bunch of professors,

00:00:37.842 --> 00:00:40.563
most of whom you've never seen before,

00:00:40.587 --> 00:00:43.206
give you their unfiltered opinions of it.

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.890
So it's my turn and I'm standing
next to my table,

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:50.710
everything neatly lined up,

00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:54.534
and I'm just hoping
that my professors can see

00:00:54.558 --> 00:01:00.131
how much effort I've put
into making my designs practical

00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:03.810
and ergonomic and sustainable.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.290
And I'm starting to get really nervous,

00:01:07.314 --> 00:01:10.605
because for a long time,
no one says anything.

00:01:10.629 --> 00:01:12.580
It's just completely silent.

00:01:13.067 --> 00:01:15.947
And then one of the professors
starts to speak, and he says,

00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:18.448
"Your work gives me a feeling of joy."

00:01:19.407 --> 00:01:20.557
Joy?

00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:24.850
I wanted to be a designer
because I wanted to solve real problems.

00:01:24.874 --> 00:01:29.232
Joy is nice, I guess,
but it's kind of light --

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:30.695
not substantial.

00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:33.493
But I was also kind of intrigued,

00:01:33.517 --> 00:01:38.004
because joy is this intangible feeling,

00:01:38.028 --> 00:01:41.579
and how does that come
from the stuff on the table next to me?

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:43.686
I asked the professors,

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.119
"How do things make us feel joy?

00:01:46.143 --> 00:01:51.106
How do tangible things
make us feel intangible joy?"

00:01:52.306 --> 00:01:56.490
They hemmed and hawed
and gestured a lot with their hands.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.782
"They just do," they said.

00:01:59.907 --> 00:02:01.735
I packed up my things for the summer,

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.911
but I couldn't stop thinking
about this question ...

00:02:06.107 --> 00:02:07.576
and this launched a journey --

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.732
one that I didn't know at the time
would take me 10 years --

00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:14.219
to understand the relationship
between the physical world

00:02:14.243 --> 00:02:19.223
and the mysterious,
quixotic emotion we call "joy."

00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:24.137
And what I discovered
is that not only are they linked,

00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:27.795
but that the physical world
can be a powerful resource to us

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.424
in creating happier, healthier lives.

00:02:32.362 --> 00:02:33.541
After my review,

00:02:33.565 --> 00:02:36.038
I thought, "I know what joy feels like,

00:02:36.062 --> 00:02:38.371
but what is it, exactly?"

00:02:38.717 --> 00:02:42.144
And I found that even scientists
don't always agree,

00:02:42.168 --> 00:02:45.643
and they sometimes use the words "joy"
and "happiness" and "positivity"

00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:47.461
more or less interchangeably.

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.878
But broadly speaking,
when psychologists use the word joy,

00:02:51.902 --> 00:02:55.307
what they mean is an intense,
momentary experience

00:02:55.331 --> 00:02:56.774
of positive emotion --

00:02:56.798 --> 00:03:00.795
one that makes us smile and laugh
and feel like we want to jump up and down.

00:03:01.152 --> 00:03:03.011
And this is actually a technical thing.

00:03:03.035 --> 00:03:05.036
That feeling of wanting
to jump up and down

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.321
is one of the ways
that scientists measure joy.

00:03:09.387 --> 00:03:11.005
It's different than happiness,

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:13.664
which measures how good we feel over time.

00:03:13.688 --> 00:03:16.672
Joy is about feeling good in the moment,

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:17.846
right now.

00:03:19.007 --> 00:03:20.481
And this was interesting to me

00:03:20.505 --> 00:03:24.023
because as a culture, we are obsessed
with the pursuit of happiness,

00:03:24.047 --> 00:03:27.907
and yet in the process,
we kind of overlook joy.

00:03:30.737 --> 00:03:33.904
So this got me thinking:

00:03:33.928 --> 00:03:35.866
Where does joy come from?

00:03:36.797 --> 00:03:38.370
I started asking everyone I knew,

00:03:38.394 --> 00:03:41.335
and even people I just met on the street,

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.219
about the things that brought them joy.

00:03:43.243 --> 00:03:46.156
On the subway, in a café, on an airplane,

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.425
it was, "Hi, nice to meet you.
What brings you joy?"

00:03:50.544 --> 00:03:52.320
I felt like a detective.

00:03:52.867 --> 00:03:54.792
I was like, "When did you last see it?

00:03:54.816 --> 00:03:56.603
Who were you with? What color was it?

00:03:56.627 --> 00:03:57.802
Did anyone else see it?"

00:03:58.353 --> 00:04:00.607
I was the Nancy Drew of joy.

00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:01.781
(Laughter)

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.960
And after a few months of this,
I noticed that there were certain things

00:04:05.984 --> 00:04:09.037
that started to come up again
and again and again.

00:04:09.061 --> 00:04:12.344
They were things like cherry blossoms

00:04:12.368 --> 00:04:13.672
and bubbles ...

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.929
swimming pools and tree houses ...

00:04:19.728 --> 00:04:23.446
hot air balloons and googly eyes --

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.549
(Laughter)

00:04:24.573 --> 00:04:27.678
and ice cream cones,
especially the ones with the sprinkles.

00:04:29.172 --> 00:04:34.037
These things seemed to cut across lines
of age and gender and ethnicity.

00:04:34.543 --> 00:04:36.020
I mean, if you think about it,

00:04:36.044 --> 00:04:38.004
we all stop and turn our heads to the sky

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:40.831
when the multicolored arc
of a rainbow streaks across it.

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:43.448
And fireworks --

00:04:43.472 --> 00:04:45.560
we don't even need to know
what they're for,

00:04:45.584 --> 00:04:48.451
and we feel like we're celebrating, too.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.608
These things aren't joyful
for just a few people;

00:04:53.632 --> 00:04:56.461
they're joyful for nearly everyone.

00:04:56.485 --> 00:04:58.546
They're universally joyful.

00:05:00.504 --> 00:05:02.883
And seeing them all together,

00:05:02.907 --> 00:05:06.588
it gave me this indescribably
hopeful feeling.

00:05:08.012 --> 00:05:11.101
The sharply divided,
politically polarized world we live in

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:16.155
sometimes has the effect
of making our differences feel so vast

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:18.080
as to be insurmountable.

00:05:18.104 --> 00:05:19.396
And yet underneath it all,

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.052
there's a part of each of us
that finds joy in the same things.

00:05:24.156 --> 00:05:28.283
And though we're often told
that these are just passing pleasures,

00:05:28.307 --> 00:05:30.861
in fact, they're really important,

00:05:30.885 --> 00:05:34.337
because they remind us
of the shared humanity we find

00:05:34.361 --> 00:05:37.173
in our common experience
of the physical world.

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:39.754
But I still needed to know:

00:05:39.778 --> 00:05:44.433
What is it about these things
that makes them so joyful?

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:48.207
I had pictures of them
up on my studio wall,

00:05:48.231 --> 00:05:51.548
and every day, I would come in
and try to make sense of it.

00:05:52.662 --> 00:05:55.294
And then one day, something just clicked.

00:05:56.144 --> 00:05:58.302
I saw all these patterns:

00:05:59.422 --> 00:06:00.715
round things ...

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:03.905
pops of bright color ...

00:06:05.512 --> 00:06:07.211
symmetrical shapes ...

00:06:08.636 --> 00:06:11.433
a sense of abundance and multiplicity ...

00:06:12.877 --> 00:06:16.261
a feeling of lightness or elevation.

00:06:17.328 --> 00:06:18.479
When I saw it this way,

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:22.582
I realized that though the feeling of joy
is mysterious and elusive,

00:06:22.606 --> 00:06:25.924
we can access it through tangible,
physical attributes,

00:06:25.948 --> 00:06:28.762
or what designers call aesthetics,

00:06:28.786 --> 00:06:32.432
a word that comes from the same root
as the Greek word "aísthomai,"

00:06:32.456 --> 00:06:36.452
which means, "I feel,"
"I sense," "I perceive."

00:06:37.668 --> 00:06:42.119
And since these patterns were telling me
that joy begins with the senses,

00:06:42.143 --> 00:06:44.986
I began calling them "Aesthetics of Joy";

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.959
the sensations of joy.

00:06:48.484 --> 00:06:50.112
And in the wake of this discovery,

00:06:50.136 --> 00:06:52.281
I noticed something
that as I walked around,

00:06:52.305 --> 00:06:57.396
I began spotting little moments
of joy everywhere I went --

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:58.776
a vintage yellow car

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.722
or a clever piece of street art.

00:07:00.746 --> 00:07:05.479
It was like I had a pair
of rose-colored glasses,

00:07:05.503 --> 00:07:08.363
and now that I knew what to look for,

00:07:08.387 --> 00:07:09.741
I was seeing it everywhere.

00:07:09.765 --> 00:07:13.194
It was like these little moments of joy
were hidden in plain sight.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.448
And at the same time,

00:07:16.472 --> 00:07:17.805
I had another realization,

00:07:17.829 --> 00:07:20.878
that if these are the things
that bring us joy,

00:07:20.902 --> 00:07:23.377
then why does so much
of the world look like this?

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:24.990
(Laughter)

00:07:25.014 --> 00:07:26.545
Why do we go to work here?

00:07:27.476 --> 00:07:30.165
Why do we send our kids to schools
that look like this?

00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:33.402
Why do our cities look like this?

00:07:34.256 --> 00:07:39.067
And this is most acute for the places
that house the people

00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:41.219
that are most vulnerable among us:

00:07:41.243 --> 00:07:42.576
nursing homes,

00:07:43.312 --> 00:07:44.512
hospitals,

00:07:45.413 --> 00:07:46.806
homeless shelters,

00:07:47.473 --> 00:07:48.848
housing projects.

00:07:49.925 --> 00:07:53.139
How did we end up in a world
that looks like this?

00:07:54.992 --> 00:07:57.070
We all start out joyful,

00:07:57.094 --> 00:08:00.668
but as we get older,

00:08:00.692 --> 00:08:05.205
being colorful or exuberant
opens us up to judgment.

00:08:05.883 --> 00:08:11.058
Adults who exhibit genuine joy
are often dismissed as childish

00:08:11.082 --> 00:08:13.142
or too feminine

00:08:13.166 --> 00:08:15.328
or unserious

00:08:15.352 --> 00:08:17.316
or self-indulgent,

00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:21.734
and so we hold ourselves back from joy,

00:08:21.758 --> 00:08:24.341
and we end up in a world
that looks like this.

00:08:25.936 --> 00:08:27.842
But if the aesthetics of joy can be used

00:08:27.866 --> 00:08:30.128
to help us find more joy
in the world around us,

00:08:30.152 --> 00:08:32.838
then couldn't they also be used
to create more joy?

00:08:33.537 --> 00:08:35.971
I spent that last two years
scouring the planet,

00:08:35.995 --> 00:08:39.954
looking for different ways
that people have answered this question.

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:43.232
And this led me to the work
of the artist Arakawa

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:44.987
and the poet Madeline Gins,

00:08:45.011 --> 00:08:49.803
who believed that these kinds
of environments are literally killing us.

00:08:50.686 --> 00:08:54.519
And so they set out the create
an apartment building

00:08:54.543 --> 00:08:57.058
that they believed would reverse aging.

00:08:58.313 --> 00:08:59.483
And this is it.

00:09:00.026 --> 00:09:03.241
(Laughter)

00:09:03.265 --> 00:09:06.758
(Applause)

00:09:06.782 --> 00:09:09.751
It's a real place, just outside Tokyo.

00:09:09.775 --> 00:09:13.402
I spent a night there, and it's a lot.

00:09:13.426 --> 00:09:16.125
(Laughter)

00:09:16.149 --> 00:09:17.886
The floors undulate,

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.175
so you don't end up walking around

00:09:20.199 --> 00:09:22.701
so much as kind of bouncing
around the apartment,

00:09:22.725 --> 00:09:26.957
and there are bright colors
in every direction.

00:09:28.265 --> 00:09:30.602
I'm not sure I left any younger,

00:09:30.626 --> 00:09:34.830
but it's as if, by trying
to create an apartment

00:09:34.854 --> 00:09:36.926
that would make us feel youthful,

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.280
they ended up creating
one that was joyful.

00:09:41.277 --> 00:09:43.809
And yes, this is a bit much
for everyday life,

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:47.239
but it made me wonder:
What about the rest of us?

00:09:47.263 --> 00:09:51.674
How do we bring these ideas
back into the real world?

00:09:52.621 --> 00:09:55.309
So I started finding people
who were doing just that.

00:09:55.939 --> 00:09:59.943
For example, this hospital, designed
by the Danish artist Poul Gernes.

00:10:00.674 --> 00:10:02.154
Or these schools,

00:10:02.178 --> 00:10:04.626
transformed by the non-profit Publicolor.

00:10:05.195 --> 00:10:08.734
What's interesting is that Publicolor
has heard from school administrators

00:10:08.758 --> 00:10:11.888
who say that attendance improves,

00:10:11.912 --> 00:10:13.788
graffiti disappears

00:10:13.812 --> 00:10:17.553
and kids actually say they feel safer
in these painted schools.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.087
And this aligns with research
conducted in four countries,

00:10:21.111 --> 00:10:24.738
which shows that people
working in more colorful offices

00:10:24.762 --> 00:10:26.417
are actually more alert,

00:10:26.441 --> 00:10:27.698
more confident

00:10:27.722 --> 00:10:30.669
and friendlier than those
working in drab spaces.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.212
Why would this be the case?

00:10:34.236 --> 00:10:38.227
Well, as I started to trace back
our love of color,

00:10:38.251 --> 00:10:42.553
I found that some researchers
see a connection to our evolution.

00:10:43.292 --> 00:10:48.563
Color, in a very primal way,
is a sign of life, a sign of energy.

00:10:49.063 --> 00:10:51.092
And the same is true of abundance.

00:10:51.116 --> 00:10:54.466
We evolved in a world
where scarcity is dangerous,

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.175
and abundance meant survival.

00:10:58.091 --> 00:11:01.314
So, one confetto --

00:11:01.338 --> 00:11:03.568
which happens to be
the singular of confetti,

00:11:03.592 --> 00:11:04.989
in case you were wondering --

00:11:05.013 --> 00:11:06.378
(Laughter)

00:11:06.402 --> 00:11:08.463
isn't very joyful,

00:11:08.487 --> 00:11:09.910
but multiply it,

00:11:09.934 --> 00:11:12.697
and you have a handful
of one of the most joyful substances

00:11:12.721 --> 00:11:13.871
on the planet.

00:11:14.494 --> 00:11:18.479
The architect Emmanuelle Moureaux
uses this idea in her work a lot.

00:11:18.503 --> 00:11:20.295
This is a nursing home she designed,

00:11:20.319 --> 00:11:24.756
where she uses these multicolored spheres
to create a feeling of abundance.

00:11:25.752 --> 00:11:28.016
And what about all those
round things I noticed?

00:11:29.159 --> 00:11:32.451
Well, it turns out neuroscientists
have studied this, too.

00:11:32.475 --> 00:11:34.896
They put people into fMRI machines,

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.267
and they showed them pictures
of angular objects and round ones.

00:11:40.011 --> 00:11:42.417
And what they found is that the amygdala,

00:11:42.441 --> 00:11:46.067
a part of the brain associated
in part with fear and anxiety,

00:11:46.091 --> 00:11:48.280
lit up when people
looked at angular objects,

00:11:48.304 --> 00:11:50.304
but not when they looked
at the round ones.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.830
They speculate that because
angles in nature

00:11:54.854 --> 00:11:58.387
are often associated with objects
that might be dangerous to us,

00:11:58.411 --> 00:12:03.426
that we evolved an unconscious
sense of caution around these shapes,

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:06.045
whereas curves set us at ease.

00:12:06.637 --> 00:12:10.513
You can see this in action
in the new Sandy Hook Elementary School.

00:12:11.257 --> 00:12:13.260
After the mass shooting there in 2012,

00:12:13.284 --> 00:12:15.253
the architects Svigals + Partners

00:12:15.277 --> 00:12:18.540
knew that they needed to create
a building that was secure,

00:12:18.564 --> 00:12:20.811
but they wanted to create
one that was joyful,

00:12:20.835 --> 00:12:22.528
and so they filled it with curves.

00:12:22.552 --> 00:12:25.393
There are waves running
along the side of the building,

00:12:25.417 --> 00:12:28.758
and these squiggly canopies
over the entryway,

00:12:28.782 --> 00:12:31.686
and the whole building bends
toward the entrance

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.366
in a welcoming gesture.

00:12:35.726 --> 00:12:38.349
Each moment of joy is small,

00:12:38.373 --> 00:12:42.583
but over time, they add up to more
than the sum of their parts.

00:12:44.553 --> 00:12:47.892
And so maybe instead
of chasing after happiness,

00:12:47.916 --> 00:12:51.094
what we should be doing is embracing joy

00:12:51.118 --> 00:12:56.063
and finding ways to put ourselves
in the path of it more often.

00:12:57.697 --> 00:12:58.886
Deep within us,

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:03.808
we all have this impulse
to seek out joy in our surroundings.

00:13:04.453 --> 00:13:06.552
And we have it for a reason.

00:13:07.223 --> 00:13:10.675
Joy isn't some superfluous extra.

00:13:11.573 --> 00:13:16.693
It's directly connected to our fundamental
instinct for survival.

00:13:17.885 --> 00:13:20.129
On the most basic level,

00:13:20.153 --> 00:13:24.881
the drive toward joy
is the drive toward life.

00:13:25.534 --> 00:13:26.684
Thank you.

00:13:26.708 --> 00:13:28.592
(Applause)

00:13:28.616 --> 00:13:29.767
Thank you.

00:13:29.791 --> 00:13:30.977
Thank you,

00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:32.152
thank you.

00:13:32.176 --> 00:13:37.603
(Applause)
