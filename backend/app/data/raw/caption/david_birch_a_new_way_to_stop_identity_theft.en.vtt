00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:15.603
So I thought I'd talk about identity.

00:00:15.627 --> 00:00:18.148
That's sort of an interesting
enough topic to me.

00:00:18.172 --> 00:00:21.556
And the reason was,
because when I was asked to do this,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.008
I'd just read in one of the papers,
I can't remember,

00:00:25.032 --> 00:00:27.904
something from someone at Facebook saying,

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:30.513
"Well, we need to make everybody
use their real names,

00:00:30.537 --> 00:00:32.981
and then that's basically
all the problems solved."

00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:34.460
And that's so wrong,

00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:38.207
that's such a fundamentally
reactionary view of identity,

00:00:38.231 --> 00:00:40.629
and it's going to get us
into all sorts of trouble.

00:00:40.653 --> 00:00:42.196
And so what I thought I'd do is,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.177
I'll explain four sort of
problems about it,

00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:47.999
and then I'll suggest a solution,

00:00:48.023 --> 00:00:50.140
which, hopefully,
you might find interesting.

00:00:50.164 --> 00:00:51.920
So just to frame the problem:

00:00:51.944 --> 00:00:53.709
What does "authenticity" mean?

00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:55.274
That's me,

00:00:55.298 --> 00:00:59.918
that's a camera phone picture
of me looking at a painting.

00:00:59.942 --> 00:01:01.004
[What's the Problem?]

00:01:01.028 --> 00:01:03.810
That's a painting that was painted
by a very famous forger,

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:06.040
and because I'm not very good
at presentations,

00:01:06.064 --> 00:01:08.804
I already can't remember the name
that I wrote on my card.

00:01:08.828 --> 00:01:12.435
And he was incarcerated in,
I think, Wakefield Prison,

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:16.231
for forging masterpieces by,
I think, French Impressionists.

00:01:16.255 --> 00:01:19.144
And he's so good at it
that when he was in prison,

00:01:19.168 --> 00:01:21.364
everybody in prison,
the governor and whatever,

00:01:21.388 --> 00:01:23.827
wanted him to paint masterpieces
to put on the walls

00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:25.096
because they were so good.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.297
And so that's a masterpiece,
which is a fake of a masterpiece,

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:35.007
and bonded into the canvas is a chip
which identifies that as a real fake,

00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:36.191
if you see what I mean.

00:01:36.215 --> 00:01:37.268
(Laughter)

00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:39.575
So when we're talking about authenticity,

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.897
it's a little more fractal
than it appears,

00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:44.105
and that's a good example to show it.

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:49.432
I tried to pick four problems
that will frame the issue properly.

00:01:49.456 --> 00:01:51.946
So the first problem, I thought,
chip and PIN, right?

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.667
[Banks and legacies
bringing down the system from within]

00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:56.512
[Offline solutions do not work online]

00:01:56.536 --> 00:01:58.536
Everyone's got a chip and PIN card, right?

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.003
So why is that a good example?

00:02:00.027 --> 00:02:02.804
That's the example
of how legacy thinking about identity

00:02:02.828 --> 00:02:05.679
subverts the security
of a well-constructed system.

00:02:05.703 --> 00:02:08.767
That chip-and-PIN card
that's in your pocket

00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:11.812
has a little chip on it
that cost millions of pounds to develop,

00:02:11.836 --> 00:02:13.261
is extremely secure,

00:02:13.285 --> 00:02:15.653
you can put scanning
electron microscopes on it,

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:17.847
you can try and grind it down,
blah blah blah.

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:21.258
Those chips have never been broken,
whatever you read in the paper.

00:02:21.282 --> 00:02:24.541
And for a joke,
we take that supersecure chip,

00:02:24.565 --> 00:02:28.216
and we bond it to a trivially
counterfeitable magnetic stripe.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.431
And for very lazy criminals,
we still emboss the card.

00:02:31.455 --> 00:02:35.106
So if you're a criminal in a hurry
and you need to copy someone's card,

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.271
you can just stick a piece of paper on it
and rub a pencil over it

00:02:38.295 --> 00:02:39.474
just to speed things up.

00:02:39.498 --> 00:02:42.332
And even more amusingly,
and on my debit card, too,

00:02:42.356 --> 00:02:45.634
we print the name and the sort code
and everything else on the front.

00:02:45.658 --> 00:02:47.208
Why?

00:02:47.754 --> 00:02:51.867
There is no earthly reason why your name
is printed on a chip-and-PIN card.

00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:53.788
And if you think about it,

00:02:53.812 --> 00:02:56.812
it's even more insidious and perverse
than it seems at first.

00:02:56.836 --> 00:03:00.349
Because the only people that benefit
from having the name on the card

00:03:00.373 --> 00:03:01.528
are criminals.

00:03:01.552 --> 00:03:03.173
You know what your name is, right?

00:03:03.197 --> 00:03:04.204
(Laughter)

00:03:04.228 --> 00:03:06.553
And when you go into a shop
and buy something,

00:03:06.577 --> 00:03:08.972
it's a PIN -- he doesn't care
what the name is.

00:03:08.996 --> 00:03:11.774
The only place you ever have to write
your name on the back

00:03:11.798 --> 00:03:12.953
is in America.

00:03:12.977 --> 00:03:14.178
Whenever I go to America,

00:03:14.202 --> 00:03:17.035
and I have to pay with a magstripe
on the back of the card,

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:20.414
I always sign it "Carlos Tethers" anyway,
just as a security mechanism,

00:03:20.438 --> 00:03:22.498
because if a transaction
ever gets disputed,

00:03:22.522 --> 00:03:24.528
and it comes back
and it says "Dave Birch,"

00:03:24.552 --> 00:03:26.279
I know it must have been a criminal,

00:03:26.303 --> 00:03:28.527
because I would never
sign it "Dave Birch."

00:03:28.551 --> 00:03:29.805
(Laughter)

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:31.872
So if you drop your card in the street,

00:03:31.896 --> 00:03:34.101
it means a criminal
can pick it up and read it.

00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:36.983
They know the name,
from the name, they can find the address,

00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:39.178
and then they can go off
and buy stuff online.

00:03:39.202 --> 00:03:40.881
Why do we put the name on the card?

00:03:40.905 --> 00:03:44.486
Because we think identity
is something to do with names,

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.552
and because we're rooted
in the idea of the identity card,

00:03:48.576 --> 00:03:49.754
which obsesses us.

00:03:49.778 --> 00:03:52.370
And I know it crashed and burned
a couple of years ago,

00:03:52.394 --> 00:03:56.304
but if you're someone in politics
or the Home Office or whatever,

00:03:56.328 --> 00:03:57.752
and you think about identity,

00:03:57.776 --> 00:04:00.992
you can only think of identity
in terms of cards with names on.

00:04:01.016 --> 00:04:03.831
And that's very subversive
in a modern world.

00:04:04.427 --> 00:04:06.680
So the second example I thought I'd use

00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:08.499
is chat rooms.

00:04:08.523 --> 00:04:09.679
[Chatrooms and Children]

00:04:09.703 --> 00:04:11.191
I'm very proud of that picture.

00:04:11.215 --> 00:04:13.709
That's my son playing
in his band with his friends

00:04:13.733 --> 00:04:17.668
for the first-ever gig,
I believe you call it, where he got paid.

00:04:17.692 --> 00:04:18.733
(Laughter)

00:04:18.757 --> 00:04:20.484
And I love that picture.

00:04:20.508 --> 00:04:23.800
I'll like the picture of him
getting into medical school a lot better,

00:04:23.824 --> 00:04:24.840
(Laughter)

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:26.360
I like that one for the moment.

00:04:26.384 --> 00:04:27.635
Why do I use that picture?

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:32.145
Because that was very interesting,
watching that experience as an old person.

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:33.524
So him and his friends,

00:04:33.548 --> 00:04:36.403
they get together, they booked a room,
like a church hall,

00:04:36.427 --> 00:04:39.490
and they got all their friends
who had bands, got them together,

00:04:39.514 --> 00:04:40.992
and they do it all on Facebook,

00:04:41.016 --> 00:04:44.604
and then they sell tickets,
and the first band on the --

00:04:44.628 --> 00:04:48.229
I was going to say "menu," that's
probably the wrong word for it, isn't it?

00:04:48.253 --> 00:04:50.159
The first band on the list of bands

00:04:50.183 --> 00:04:54.000
that appears at some
public music performance of some kind

00:04:54.024 --> 00:04:56.603
gets the sales from the first 20 tickets,

00:04:56.627 --> 00:04:58.348
then the next band gets the next 20,

00:04:58.372 --> 00:04:59.541
and so on.

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:01.851
They were at the bottom
of the menu, like, fifth,

00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:03.259
I thought they had no chance.

00:05:03.283 --> 00:05:05.341
He actually got 20 quid. Fantastic, right?

00:05:05.365 --> 00:05:07.399
But my point is,
that all worked perfectly,

00:05:07.423 --> 00:05:09.727
except on the web.

00:05:09.751 --> 00:05:12.343
So they're sitting on Facebook,

00:05:12.367 --> 00:05:15.007
and they're sending these messages
and arranging things,

00:05:15.031 --> 00:05:17.616
and they don't know who anybody is, right?

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.606
That's the problem we're trying to solve.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.301
If only they were using real names,

00:05:21.325 --> 00:05:23.952
then you wouldn't be worried
about them on the internet.

00:05:23.976 --> 00:05:25.136
So when he says to me,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.205
"Oh, I want to go to a chat room
to talk about guitars" or something,

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.354
I'm like, "Oh, well,
I don't want you to go into a chat room

00:05:32.378 --> 00:05:34.062
to talk about guitars,

00:05:34.086 --> 00:05:36.111
because they might
not all be your friends,

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:38.408
and some of the people
that are in the chat room

00:05:38.432 --> 00:05:41.653
might be, you know, perverts
and teachers and vicars --"

00:05:41.677 --> 00:05:43.447
(Laughter)

00:05:43.471 --> 00:05:46.742
I mean, they generally are,
when you look in the paper, right?

00:05:46.766 --> 00:05:49.747
"So I want to know who all the people
in the chat room are.

00:05:49.771 --> 00:05:51.534
So, OK, you can go in the chat room,

00:05:51.558 --> 00:05:54.658
but only if everybody in the chat room
is using their real names,

00:05:54.682 --> 00:05:57.646
and they submit full copies
of their police report."

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:58.824
(Laughter)

00:05:58.848 --> 00:06:02.043
But of course, if anybody
in the chat room asked for his real name,

00:06:02.067 --> 00:06:04.587
I'd say, "No. You can't
give them your real name,

00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:07.109
because what happens
if they turn out to be perverts

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:09.317
and teachers and whatever?"

00:06:09.341 --> 00:06:11.152
So you have this odd sort of paradox

00:06:11.176 --> 00:06:13.327
where I'm happy for him
to go into this space

00:06:13.351 --> 00:06:15.193
if I know who everybody else is,

00:06:15.217 --> 00:06:17.820
but I don't want anybody else
to know who he is.

00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:20.257
And so you get this sort of
logjam around identity,

00:06:20.281 --> 00:06:22.683
where you want full disclosure
from everybody else,

00:06:22.707 --> 00:06:23.863
but not from yourself.

00:06:23.887 --> 00:06:25.735
And there's no progress, we get stuck.

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:27.876
So the chat room thing
doesn't work properly,

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.506
and it's a very bad way
of thinking about identity.

00:06:30.937 --> 00:06:34.762
Cheerleading ... so, on my RSS feed,
I saw this thing about --

00:06:34.786 --> 00:06:37.358
I just said something bad
about my RSS feed, didn't I?

00:06:37.382 --> 00:06:39.008
I should stop saying it like that.

00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:40.892
For some random reason I can't imagine,

00:06:40.916 --> 00:06:43.357
something about cheerleaders
turned up in my in-box.

00:06:43.381 --> 00:06:46.735
And I read this story about cheerleaders,
and it's a fascinating story.

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:48.913
This happened a couple
of years ago in the US.

00:06:48.937 --> 00:06:52.240
There were some cheerleaders
in a team at a high school in the US,

00:06:52.264 --> 00:06:55.046
and they said mean things
about their cheerleading coach,

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.842
as I'm sure kids do about
all of their teachers all of the time,

00:06:58.866 --> 00:07:01.545
and somehow, the cheerleading coach
found out about this.

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:02.728
She was very upset.

00:07:02.752 --> 00:07:04.738
So she went to one of the girls and said,

00:07:04.762 --> 00:07:06.875
"You have to give me
your Facebook password."

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:08.106
I read this all the time,

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.800
where even at some universities
and places of education,

00:07:10.824 --> 00:07:13.363
kids are forced to hand over
their Facebook passwords.

00:07:13.387 --> 00:07:15.637
So you have to give them
your Facebook password.

00:07:15.661 --> 00:07:18.533
So the kid -- she was a kid! --
what she should have said is,

00:07:18.557 --> 00:07:21.294
"My lawyer will be calling
you first thing in the morning.

00:07:21.318 --> 00:07:24.628
It's an outrageous imposition
on my Fourth Amendment right to privacy.

00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:26.794
You'll be sued
for all the money you've got!"

00:07:26.818 --> 00:07:28.398
That's what she should have said.

00:07:28.422 --> 00:07:30.681
But she's a kid,
so she hands over the password.

00:07:30.705 --> 00:07:32.112
The teacher can't log in,

00:07:32.136 --> 00:07:34.533
because the school
has blocked access to Facebook.

00:07:34.557 --> 00:07:37.340
So the teacher can't log into Facebook
till she gets home.

00:07:37.364 --> 00:07:38.801
So the girl tells her friends,

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:41.516
"Guess what happened?
The teacher logged in. She knows."

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.675
So the girls all logged into Facebook
and deleted their profiles.

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:47.289
So when the teacher logged in,
there was nothing there.

00:07:47.313 --> 00:07:51.295
My point is: those identities,
they don't think about them the same way.

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:55.169
Identity is -- especially when
you're a teenager -- a fluid thing.

00:07:55.193 --> 00:07:57.729
You have lots of identities,
you experiment with them.

00:07:57.753 --> 00:08:01.433
And if you have an identity you don't
like because it's subverted in some way

00:08:01.457 --> 00:08:03.315
or it's insecure or it's inappropriate,

00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:05.207
you just delete it and get another one.

00:08:05.231 --> 00:08:08.458
The idea that you have an identity
that's given to you by someone,

00:08:08.482 --> 00:08:09.781
the government or whatever,

00:08:09.805 --> 00:08:12.869
and you have to stick with that identity
and use it in all places

00:08:12.893 --> 00:08:14.046
is absolutely wrong.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.997
Why would you want to really know
who someone was on Facebook,

00:08:17.021 --> 00:08:19.846
unless you wanted to abuse them
and harass them in some way?

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.766
It just doesn't work properly.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.240
And my fourth example is,

00:08:23.264 --> 00:08:26.470
there are some cases
where you really want to be --

00:08:26.494 --> 00:08:30.041
in case you're wondering,
that's me at the G20 protest.

00:08:30.065 --> 00:08:31.827
I wasn't actually at the G20 protest,

00:08:31.851 --> 00:08:35.907
but I had a meeting at a bank
on the day of the G20 protest.

00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:37.913
And I got an email from the bank, saying,

00:08:37.937 --> 00:08:41.215
"Please don't wear a suit,
because it'll inflame the protesters."

00:08:41.239 --> 00:08:43.579
I look pretty good in a suit, frankly,

00:08:43.603 --> 00:08:46.897
so you can see why it would drive them
into an anticapitalist frenzy.

00:08:46.921 --> 00:08:47.929
(Laughter)

00:08:47.953 --> 00:08:51.196
So I thought, "Well, if I don't
want to inflame the protesters,

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.825
the obvious thing to do
is go dressed as a protester."

00:08:53.849 --> 00:08:57.230
So I went dressed completely in black,
you know, black balaclava ...

00:08:57.254 --> 00:09:00.416
I had black gloves on but took them off
to sign the visitors' book.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.442
(Laughter)

00:09:01.466 --> 00:09:04.764
I'm wearing black trousers and boots,
I'm dressed completely in black.

00:09:04.788 --> 00:09:07.378
I go into the bank at 10am
and go, "Hi, I'm Dave Birch,

00:09:07.402 --> 00:09:09.172
I've got a 3 o'clock with so-and-so."

00:09:09.196 --> 00:09:11.868
"Sure!" And they sign me in.
There's my visitor's badge.

00:09:11.892 --> 00:09:12.894
(Laughter)

00:09:12.918 --> 00:09:16.766
So this nonsense about "you've got to have
real names on Facebook" and whatever,

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.566
that gets you that kind of security.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.691
That gets you "security theater,"

00:09:20.715 --> 00:09:22.662
where there's no actual security,

00:09:22.686 --> 00:09:25.988
but people are sort of playing parts
in a play about security,

00:09:26.012 --> 00:09:28.111
and as long as everybody
learns their lines,

00:09:28.135 --> 00:09:29.288
everyone's happy.

00:09:29.312 --> 00:09:31.284
But it's not real security, right?

00:09:32.036 --> 00:09:35.073
Especially because I hate banks
more than the G20 protesters do,

00:09:35.097 --> 00:09:36.258
because I work for them.

00:09:36.282 --> 00:09:39.465
I know that things are actually worse
than these guys think.

00:09:39.489 --> 00:09:41.532
(Laughter)

00:09:42.472 --> 00:09:47.353
But suppose I worked
next to somebody in a bank

00:09:47.377 --> 00:09:48.764
who was doing something --

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:53.487
you know, they were like people who take
the money from banks and don't ...

00:09:53.511 --> 00:09:55.095
you know, they take the money ...

00:09:55.119 --> 00:09:57.505
Oh -- "traders."
That's the word I was thinking of.

00:09:57.529 --> 00:09:59.633
Suppose I was sitting
next to a rogue trader,

00:09:59.657 --> 00:10:01.917
and I want to report it
to the boss of the bank.

00:10:01.941 --> 00:10:03.947
So I log on to do a little whistleblowing.

00:10:03.971 --> 00:10:06.128
I send a message,
"This guy's a rogue trader."

00:10:06.152 --> 00:10:07.484
That message is meaningless

00:10:07.508 --> 00:10:10.076
if you don't know
that I'm a trader at the bank.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.037
If that message just comes from anybody,

00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:14.695
it has zero information value.

00:10:14.719 --> 00:10:16.750
There's no point in sending that message.

00:10:16.774 --> 00:10:18.841
You have to know that I'm ...

00:10:18.865 --> 00:10:21.283
But if I have to prove who I am,

00:10:21.307 --> 00:10:23.052
I'll never send that message.

00:10:23.076 --> 00:10:26.665
It's just like the nurse in the hospital
reporting the drunk surgeon.

00:10:26.689 --> 00:10:29.770
That message will only happen
if I'm anonymous.

00:10:29.794 --> 00:10:34.218
So the system has to have ways
of providing anonymity in it,

00:10:34.242 --> 00:10:36.520
otherwise, we don't get
where we want to get to.

00:10:36.544 --> 00:10:38.628
So, four issues.

00:10:38.652 --> 00:10:40.963
So what are we going to do about it?

00:10:40.987 --> 00:10:44.087
Well, what we tend to do about it

00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:46.681
is we think about Orwell-space.

00:10:46.705 --> 00:10:50.545
And we try to make electronic versions
of the identity card

00:10:50.569 --> 00:10:52.141
that we got rid of in 1953.

00:10:52.165 --> 00:10:54.696
So we think if we had a card --

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.134
call it a Facebook login --

00:10:56.158 --> 00:10:57.354
which proves who you are,

00:10:57.378 --> 00:10:59.159
and I make you carry it all the time,

00:10:59.183 --> 00:11:00.339
that solves the problem.

00:11:00.363 --> 00:11:03.593
And of course, for all those
reasons I've just outlined, it doesn't,

00:11:03.617 --> 00:11:05.443
and it might make some problems worse.

00:11:05.467 --> 00:11:08.069
The more times you're forced
to use your real identity,

00:11:08.093 --> 00:11:09.672
certainly in transactional terms,

00:11:09.696 --> 00:11:12.593
the more likely that identity
is to get stolen and subverted.

00:11:12.617 --> 00:11:14.770
The goal is to stop people
from using identity

00:11:14.794 --> 00:11:16.815
in transactions which don't need identity,

00:11:16.839 --> 00:11:19.097
which is actually almost all transactions.

00:11:19.121 --> 00:11:23.175
Almost all of the transactions you do
are not "Who are you?"

00:11:23.199 --> 00:11:25.269
They're "Are you allowed
to drive the car?"

00:11:25.293 --> 00:11:27.807
"Are you allowed in the building?"
"Are you over 18?"

00:11:27.831 --> 00:11:29.784
etcetera, etcetera.

00:11:29.808 --> 00:11:31.495
So my suggestion -- I, like James,

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:34.540
think that there should be
a resurgence of interest in R and D.

00:11:34.564 --> 00:11:36.238
I think this is a solvable problem.

00:11:36.262 --> 00:11:37.746
It's something we can do about.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.799
Naturally, in these circumstances,
I turn to Doctor Who.

00:11:40.823 --> 00:11:41.976
Because in this --

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.001
(Laughter)

00:11:43.025 --> 00:11:44.690
as in so many other walks of life,

00:11:44.714 --> 00:11:47.413
Doctor Who has already
shown us the answer.

00:11:47.437 --> 00:11:50.610
So I should say,
for some of our foreign visitors:

00:11:50.634 --> 00:11:54.390
Doctor Who is the greatest
living scientist in England --

00:11:54.414 --> 00:11:56.079
(Laughter)

00:11:56.103 --> 00:11:58.909
and a beacon of truth
and enlightenment to all of us.

00:11:58.933 --> 00:12:01.948
And this is Doctor Who
with his "psychic paper."

00:12:01.972 --> 00:12:04.919
Come on, you guys must have seen
Doctor Who's "psychic paper."

00:12:04.943 --> 00:12:06.886
You're not nerds if you say yes.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.196
Who's seen Doctor Who's psychic paper?

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:12.429
Oh right, you were in the library
the whole time studying, I guess.

00:12:12.453 --> 00:12:14.234
Is that what you're going to tell us?

00:12:14.258 --> 00:12:15.702
Doctor Who's psychic paper is:

00:12:15.726 --> 00:12:17.393
when you hold up the psychic paper,

00:12:17.417 --> 00:12:18.764
the person, in their brain,

00:12:18.788 --> 00:12:20.915
sees the thing that they need to see.

00:12:20.939 --> 00:12:23.341
So I want to show you a British passport,

00:12:23.365 --> 00:12:24.717
I hold up the psychic paper,

00:12:24.741 --> 00:12:26.056
you see a British passport.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.707
I want to get into a party,

00:12:27.731 --> 00:12:29.115
I hold up the psychic paper,

00:12:29.139 --> 00:12:30.569
I show you a party invitation.

00:12:30.593 --> 00:12:32.526
You see what you want to see.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:35.840
So what I'm saying is, we need
to make an electronic version of that,

00:12:35.864 --> 00:12:38.070
but with one tiny, tiny change,

00:12:38.094 --> 00:12:40.667
which is that it'll only show you
the British passport

00:12:40.691 --> 00:12:41.884
if I've actually got one.

00:12:41.908 --> 00:12:44.911
It'll only show you the party invitation
if I actually have one.

00:12:44.935 --> 00:12:47.981
It will only show you that I'm over 18
if I actually am over 18.

00:12:48.005 --> 00:12:49.237
But nothing else.

00:12:49.998 --> 00:12:54.804
So you're the bouncer at the pub,
you need to know that I'm over 18.

00:12:54.828 --> 00:12:56.849
Instead of showing you my driving license,

00:12:56.873 --> 00:12:58.598
which shows you I know how to drive,

00:12:58.622 --> 00:13:01.392
what my name is, my address,
all these kind of things,

00:13:01.416 --> 00:13:02.905
I show you my psychic paper,

00:13:02.929 --> 00:13:05.362
and all it tells you is,
am I over 18 or not.

00:13:06.051 --> 00:13:07.395
Right.

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:08.893
Is that just a pipe dream?

00:13:08.917 --> 00:13:11.495
Of course not, otherwise
I wouldn't be here talking.

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:13.575
So, in order to build that
and make it work,

00:13:13.599 --> 00:13:16.362
I'm only going to name these things,
I'll not go into them:

00:13:16.386 --> 00:13:17.825
we need a plan,

00:13:17.849 --> 00:13:20.484
which is, we're going to build
this as an infrastructure

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:22.959
for everybody to use
to solve all of these problems.

00:13:22.983 --> 00:13:24.611
We're going to make a utility.

00:13:24.635 --> 00:13:27.412
The utility has to be universal,
you can use it everywhere.

00:13:27.436 --> 00:13:30.647
I'm just giving you little flashes
of the technology as we go along.

00:13:30.671 --> 00:13:31.831
That's a Japanese ATM,

00:13:31.855 --> 00:13:34.633
the fingerprint template
is stored inside the mobile phone.

00:13:34.657 --> 00:13:36.363
So when you want to draw money out,

00:13:36.387 --> 00:13:38.793
you put the phone on the ATM
and touch your finger,

00:13:38.817 --> 00:13:40.828
your fingerprint
goes through to the phone,

00:13:40.852 --> 00:13:42.662
the phone says, "Yes, that's whoever,"

00:13:42.686 --> 00:13:44.508
and the ATM then gives you some money.

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:47.543
It has to be a utility
that you can use everywhere.

00:13:47.567 --> 00:13:49.406
It has to be absolutely convenient.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:52.574
That's me going into the pub.

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:55.487
All the device on the door
of the pub is allowed is:

00:13:55.511 --> 00:13:59.161
Is this person over 18
and not barred from the pub?

00:13:59.185 --> 00:14:02.339
And so the idea is,
you touch your ID card to the door,

00:14:02.363 --> 00:14:04.377
and if I'm allowed in,
it shows my picture,

00:14:04.401 --> 00:14:05.974
if I'm not, it shows a red cross.

00:14:05.998 --> 00:14:08.001
It doesn't disclose any other information.

00:14:08.025 --> 00:14:09.648
It has to have no special gadgets.

00:14:09.672 --> 00:14:12.727
That can only mean one thing,
following on from Ross's statement,

00:14:12.751 --> 00:14:15.664
which I agree with completely:
if it means no special gadgets,

00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:17.214
it has to run on a mobile phone.

00:14:17.238 --> 00:14:20.287
That's the only choice we have,
to make it work on mobile phones.

00:14:20.311 --> 00:14:22.613
There are 6.6 billion
mobile phone subscriptions.

00:14:22.637 --> 00:14:26.231
My favorite statistic of all time:
only 4 billion toothbrushes in the world.

00:14:26.255 --> 00:14:28.160
That means something. I don't know what.

00:14:28.184 --> 00:14:29.252
(Laughter)

00:14:29.276 --> 00:14:31.476
I rely on our futurologists to tell me.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.581
It has to be a utility
which is extensible.

00:14:33.605 --> 00:14:36.138
So it has to be something
that anybody could build on.

00:14:36.162 --> 00:14:38.505
Anybody should be able
to use this infrastructure;

00:14:38.529 --> 00:14:40.783
you don't need permissions,
licenses, whatever.

00:14:40.807 --> 00:14:44.539
Anyone should be able
to write some code to do this.

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:48.656
Well, you know what symmetry is,
so you don't need a picture of it.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.262
This is how we're going to do it.

00:14:50.286 --> 00:14:52.872
We're going to do it using phones
and mobile proximity.

00:14:52.896 --> 00:14:54.361
I'm going to suggest to you

00:14:54.385 --> 00:14:57.857
the technology to implement Doctor Who's
psychic paper is already here,

00:14:57.881 --> 00:15:00.846
and if any of you have got
one of the new Barclay's debit cards

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.641
with the contactless interface on it,

00:15:02.665 --> 00:15:04.865
you've already got that technology.

00:15:04.889 --> 00:15:07.825
Have you ever been up to the big city
and used an Oyster card?

00:15:07.849 --> 00:15:09.003
Does that ring a bell?

00:15:09.027 --> 00:15:10.465
The technology already exists.

00:15:10.489 --> 00:15:12.973
The first phones that have
the technology built in --

00:15:12.997 --> 00:15:15.550
the Google Nexus, the S II,
the Samsung Wave 578 --

00:15:15.574 --> 00:15:19.503
the first phones that have the technology
built into them are already in the shops.

00:15:19.527 --> 00:15:22.421
So the idea that the gasman
can turn up at my mum's door,

00:15:22.445 --> 00:15:24.376
and he can show my mum his phone,

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.110
and she can tap it with her phone,

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:29.003
and it'll come up with green
if he really is from British Gas

00:15:29.027 --> 00:15:30.183
and allowed in,

00:15:30.207 --> 00:15:32.644
and will come up with red
if he isn't, end of story.

00:15:32.668 --> 00:15:34.294
We have the technology to do that.

00:15:34.318 --> 00:15:35.471
And what's more,

00:15:35.495 --> 00:15:38.262
although some of those things
sound a bit counterintuitive,

00:15:38.286 --> 00:15:40.631
like proving I'm over 18
without proving who I am,

00:15:40.655 --> 00:15:42.711
the cryptography to do that
not only exists,

00:15:42.735 --> 00:15:44.889
it's extremely well-known
and well-understood.

00:15:44.913 --> 00:15:47.840
Digital signatures, the blinding
of public key certificates --

00:15:47.864 --> 00:15:50.118
these technologies
have been around for a while,

00:15:50.142 --> 00:15:52.152
we've just had no way
of packaging them up.

00:15:52.176 --> 00:15:53.760
So the technology already exists.

00:15:53.784 --> 00:15:57.084
We know it works.

00:15:57.108 --> 00:15:59.591
There are a few examples
of the technology being used

00:15:59.615 --> 00:16:00.850
in experimental places.

00:16:00.874 --> 00:16:02.179
That's London Fashion Week,

00:16:02.203 --> 00:16:04.054
where we built a system with O2.

00:16:04.078 --> 00:16:06.694
That's for the Wireless
Festival in Hyde Park.

00:16:06.718 --> 00:16:09.382
You can see the person's
walking in with their VIP band,

00:16:09.406 --> 00:16:12.321
it's being checked by the Nokia phone
that's reading the band.

00:16:12.345 --> 00:16:15.326
I'm only putting those up to show you
these things are prosaic,

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.209
this stuff works in these environments.

00:16:17.233 --> 00:16:18.663
They don't need to be special.

00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:24.168
So finally, I know that you can do this,

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:28.789
because if you saw
the Easter special of Doctor Who,

00:16:28.813 --> 00:16:32.352
where he went to Mars in a bus --

00:16:32.376 --> 00:16:34.553
I should say, again,
for our foreign students:

00:16:34.577 --> 00:16:36.344
that doesn't happen in every episode.

00:16:36.368 --> 00:16:37.782
This was a very special case.

00:16:37.806 --> 00:16:40.730
So in the episode where he goes
to Mars in a London bus --

00:16:40.754 --> 00:16:42.002
I can't show you the clip,

00:16:42.026 --> 00:16:45.104
due to the outrageous restrictions
of Queen Anne-style copyright

00:16:45.128 --> 00:16:46.414
by the BBC --

00:16:46.438 --> 00:16:49.360
but in the episode where he goes
to Mars in a London bus,

00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:53.419
Doctor Who is clearly shown
getting onto the bus

00:16:53.443 --> 00:16:54.885
with the Oyster card reader

00:16:54.909 --> 00:16:56.471
using his psychic paper.

00:16:56.495 --> 00:16:59.947
Which proves that psychic paper
has an NFC interface.

00:16:59.971 --> 00:17:01.146
Thank you very much.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:02.396
(Applause)
