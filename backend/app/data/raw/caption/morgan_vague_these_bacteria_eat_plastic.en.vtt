00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:17.351
Plastics: you know about them,
you may not love them,

00:00:17.375 --> 00:00:21.000
but chances are
you use them every single day.

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:24.893
By 2050, researchers estimate

00:00:24.917 --> 00:00:27.958
that there will be more plastic
in the ocean than fish.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.893
Despite our best efforts,

00:00:30.917 --> 00:00:36.625
only nine percent of all plastic we use
winds up being recycled.

00:00:37.417 --> 00:00:38.934
And even worse,

00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.851
plastic is incredibly tough and durable

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.393
and researchers estimate

00:00:43.417 --> 00:00:47.518
that it can take anywhere
from 500 to 5,000 years

00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:49.726
to fully break down.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.268
It leaches harmful chemical contaminants
into our oceans, our soil,

00:00:55.292 --> 00:00:59.833
our food, our water, and into us.

00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:04.601
So how did we wind up
with so much plastic waste?

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:06.643
Well, it's simple.

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:12.333
Plastic is cheap, durable,
adaptable, and it's everywhere.

00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:14.184
But the good news is

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:18.809
there's something else that's cheap,
durable, adaptable and everywhere.

00:01:18.833 --> 00:01:22.184
And my research shows
it may even be able to help us

00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:24.333
with our plastic pollution problem.

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:27.875
I'm talking about bacteria.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.643
Bacteria are microscopic living beings
invisible to the naked eye

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:35.351
that live everywhere,

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:38.601
in all sorts of diverse
and extreme environments,

00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:42.226
from the human gut, to soil, to skin,

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.768
to vents in the ocean floor, reaching
temperatures of 700 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:46.792 --> 00:01:49.059
Bacteria live everywhere,

00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:52.268
in all sorts of diverse
and extreme environments.

00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:56.833
And as such, they have to get
pretty creative with their food sources.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.101
There's also a lot of them.

00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:05.184
Researchers estimate that there are
roughly five million trillion trillion --

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:10.542
that's a five with 30 zeros after it --
bacteria on the planet.

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:14.976
Now, considering that we humans produce

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.393
300 million tons of new plastic each year,

00:02:19.417 --> 00:02:21.934
I'd say that our plastic numbers

00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:24.667
are looking pretty
comparable to bacteria's.

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:28.309
So, after noticing this

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:30.643
and after learning
about all of the creative ways

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:32.684
that bacteria find food,

00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:34.893
I started to think:

00:02:34.917 --> 00:02:37.809
could bacteria in
plastic-polluted environments

00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:41.250
have figured out
how to use plastic for food?

00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:47.309
Well, this is the question that I decided
to pursue a couple of years ago.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.351
Now, fortunately for me,

00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:52.518
I'm from one of the most
polluted cities in America,

00:02:52.542 --> 00:02:54.393
Houston, Texas.

00:02:54.417 --> 00:02:55.601
(Laughs)

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:56.893
In my hometown alone,

00:02:56.917 --> 00:03:00.792
there are seven EPA-designated
Superfund sites.

00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:04.768
These are sites that are so polluted,

00:03:04.792 --> 00:03:08.917
that the government has deemed
their cleanup a national priority.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.309
So I decided to trek around to these sites

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:16.684
and collect soil samples
teeming with bacteria.

00:03:16.708 --> 00:03:19.018
I started toying with a protocol,

00:03:19.042 --> 00:03:22.101
which is fancy science talk for a recipe.

00:03:22.125 --> 00:03:26.309
And what I was trying to cook up
was a carbon-free media,

00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:29.101
or a food-free environment.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.934
An environment without the usual
carbons, or food,

00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:35.000
that bacteria, like us humans,
need to live.

00:03:36.083 --> 00:03:37.351
Now, in this environment,

00:03:37.375 --> 00:03:41.208
I would provide my bacteria
with a sole carbon, or food, source.

00:03:42.042 --> 00:03:46.393
I would feed my bacteria
polyethylene terephthalate,

00:03:46.417 --> 00:03:48.708
or PET plastic.

00:03:49.917 --> 00:03:54.934
PET plastic is the most widely produced
plastic in the world.

00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:58.018
It's used in all sorts
of food and drink containers,

00:03:58.042 --> 00:04:02.018
with the most notorious example
being plastic water bottles,

00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:07.708
of which we humans currently go through
at a rate of one million per minute.

00:04:10.042 --> 00:04:12.268
So, what I would be doing,

00:04:12.292 --> 00:04:17.184
is essentially putting my bacteria
on a forced diet of PET plastic

00:04:17.208 --> 00:04:21.750
and seeing which, if any,
might survive or, hopefully, thrive.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.518
See, this type of experiment
would act as a screen

00:04:25.542 --> 00:04:29.517
for bacteria that had adapted
to their plastic-polluted environment

00:04:29.541 --> 00:04:34.208
and evolved the incredibly cool
ability to eat PET plastic.

00:04:35.167 --> 00:04:36.809
And using this screen,

00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:40.500
I was able to find some bacteria
that had done just that.

00:04:41.375 --> 00:04:46.125
These bacteria had figured out
how to eat PET plastic.

00:04:48.583 --> 00:04:50.750
So how do these bacteria do this?

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:54.351
Well, it's actually pretty simple.

00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:58.434
Just as we humans digest carbon or food
into chunks of sugar

00:04:58.458 --> 00:05:00.309
that we then use for energy,

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.250
so too do my bacteria.

00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:07.726
My bacteria, however, have figured out
how to do this digestion process

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.875
to big, tough, durable PET plastic.

00:05:12.292 --> 00:05:15.059
Now, to do this,
my bacteria use a special version

00:05:15.083 --> 00:05:17.143
of what's called an enzyme.

00:05:17.167 --> 00:05:21.476
Now, enzymes are simply compounds
that exist in all living things.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.518
There are many different types of enzymes,

00:05:23.542 --> 00:05:26.684
but basically, they make
processes go forward,

00:05:26.708 --> 00:05:29.375
such as the digestion of food into energy.

00:05:30.417 --> 00:05:33.851
For instance, we humans
have an enzyme called an amylase

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:37.518
that helps us digest
complex starches, such as bread,

00:05:37.542 --> 00:05:40.958
into small chunks of sugar
that we can then use for energy.

00:05:42.042 --> 00:05:45.934
Now, my bacteria have
a special enzyme called a lipase

00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:49.643
that binds to big, tough,
durable PET plastic

00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:52.351
and helps break it
into small chunks of sugar

00:05:52.375 --> 00:05:55.083
that my bacteria can then use for energy.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.518
So basically,

00:05:57.542 --> 00:06:02.184
PET plastic goes from being
a big, tough, long-lasting pollutant

00:06:02.208 --> 00:06:04.542
to a tasty meal for my bacteria.

00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:08.667
Sounds pretty cool, right?

00:06:10.458 --> 00:06:15.059
And I think, given the current scope
of our plastic pollution problem,

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:16.917
I think it sounds pretty useful.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.018
The statistics I shared with you

00:06:20.042 --> 00:06:24.393
on just how much plastic waste
has accumulated on our planet

00:06:24.417 --> 00:06:25.934
are daunting.

00:06:25.958 --> 00:06:27.643
They're scary.

00:06:27.667 --> 00:06:29.143
And I think they highlight

00:06:29.167 --> 00:06:33.476
that while reducing, reusing
and recycling are important,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.167
they alone are not going to be enough
to solve this problem.

00:06:38.417 --> 00:06:42.875
And this is where I think bacteria
might be able to help us out.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.518
But I do understand
why the concept of bacterial help

00:06:47.542 --> 00:06:50.476
might make some people a little nervous.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:56.059
After all, if plastic is everywhere
and these bacteria eat plastic,

00:06:56.083 --> 00:06:59.268
isn't there a risk of these bacteria
getting out in the environment

00:06:59.292 --> 00:07:00.625
and wreaking havoc?

00:07:02.292 --> 00:07:06.143
Well, the short answer is no,
and I'll tell you why.

00:07:06.167 --> 00:07:09.542
These bacteria are already
in the environment.

00:07:10.375 --> 00:07:14.625
The bacteria in my research
are not genetically modified frankenbugs.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.559
These are naturally occurring bacteria

00:07:18.583 --> 00:07:22.351
that have simply adapted
to their plastic-polluted environment

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:27.083
and evolved the incredibly gnarly
ability to eat PET plastic.

00:07:28.167 --> 00:07:33.601
So the process of bacteria eating plastic
is actually a natural one.

00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:36.434
But it's an incredibly slow process.

00:07:36.458 --> 00:07:38.934
And there remains a lot of work to be done

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.833
to figure out how to speed up
this process to a useful pace.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.726
My research is currently
looking at ways of doing this

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.851
through a series of UV,
or ultraviolet, pretreatments,

00:07:50.875 --> 00:07:54.750
which basically means
we blast PET plastic with sunlight.

00:07:56.292 --> 00:08:00.893
We do this because sunlight
acts a bit like tenderizer on a steak,

00:08:00.917 --> 00:08:04.893
turning the big, tough,
durable bonds in PET plastic

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:08.875
a bit softer and a bit easier
for my bacteria to chew on.

00:08:10.208 --> 00:08:12.684
Ultimately, what my research hopes to do

00:08:12.708 --> 00:08:17.309
is create an industrial-scale
contained carbon-free system,

00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:19.559
similar to a compost heap,

00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:23.184
where these bacteria can thrive
in a contained system,

00:08:23.208 --> 00:08:27.375
where their sole food source
is PET plastic waste.

00:08:28.458 --> 00:08:33.143
Imagine one day being able to dispose
of all of your plastic waste

00:08:33.167 --> 00:08:34.601
in a bin at the curb

00:08:34.625 --> 00:08:40.375
that you knew was bound for a dedicated
bacteria-powered plastic waste facility.

00:08:41.542 --> 00:08:46.332
I think with some hard work
this is an achievable reality.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.643
Plastic-eating bacteria is not a cure-all.

00:08:50.667 --> 00:08:54.933
But given the current statistics,
it's clear that we humans,

00:08:54.957 --> 00:08:57.458
we could use a little help
with this problem.

00:08:58.292 --> 00:08:59.559
Because people,

00:08:59.583 --> 00:09:03.268
we possess a pressing problem
of plastic pollution.

00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:07.726
And bacteria might be
a really important part of the solution.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.018
Thank you.

00:09:09.042 --> 00:09:12.000
(Applause)
