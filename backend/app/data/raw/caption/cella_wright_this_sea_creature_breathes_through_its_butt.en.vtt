00:00:06.842 --> 00:00:09.292
Can you guess what you’re looking at?

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:16.585
Is it a fuzzy sock? An overripe banana? 
A moldy tube of toothpaste?

00:00:16.585 --> 00:00:21.176
In fact, this is the humble sea cucumber, 
and while it might look odd,

00:00:21.176 --> 00:00:26.913
its daily toil paves the way 
for entire ecosystems to thrive.

00:00:26.913 --> 00:00:30.980
Sea cucumbers are members 
of the phylum Echinodermata,

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.597
along with sea urchins, starfish 
and other radially symmetrical,

00:00:35.597 --> 00:00:38.640
“spiny-skinned” marine invertebrates.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.427
Some sea cucumbers have feathery tentacles
flowing from their mouths,

00:00:42.427 --> 00:00:45.147
some are puffed like bloated balloons,

00:00:45.147 --> 00:00:48.477
and others simply look like 
Headless Chicken Monsters—

00:00:48.477 --> 00:00:52.518
the actual name given 
to a rare deep-sea species.

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:56.518
But they are generally characterized 
by their long, cylindrical shape.

00:00:56.518 --> 00:01:02.255
A sea cucumber is essentially a brainless,
fleshy form surrounding a digestive tract,

00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:05.975
bookended by a mouth and an anus.

00:01:05.975 --> 00:01:08.895
Adhesive tube feet 
run the length of their bodies

00:01:08.895 --> 00:01:12.095
and allow them to scoot along 
the seafloor.

00:01:12.095 --> 00:01:15.680
Specialized tube feet can be used 
for feeding and respiration,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.183
though many sea cucumbers actually 
breathe through their anuses.

00:01:20.183 --> 00:01:23.063
Rhythmically contracting and relaxing 
their muscles,

00:01:23.063 --> 00:01:27.640
they draw water in and out 
over an internal lung-like structure

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.102
called a respiratory tree
that extracts oxygen from seawater.

00:01:32.102 --> 00:01:34.372
Certain species of crabs and pearlfish

00:01:34.372 --> 00:01:37.132
take advantage of this 
rhythmic action and,

00:01:37.132 --> 00:01:42.361
once the sea cucumber’s anus is dilated,
they shimmy in and take shelter.

00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:48.648
The rear end of a single sea cucumber can 
harbor up to fifteen pearlfish at a time.

00:01:48.648 --> 00:01:51.328
However, it seems that not all 
sea cucumbers

00:01:51.328 --> 00:01:53.948
put up with this intrusive behavior.

00:01:53.948 --> 00:01:57.438
Some species are equipped with five teeth
around their anus,

00:01:57.438 --> 00:02:00.728
suggesting that they may have taken
an evolutionary stand

00:02:00.728 --> 00:02:03.239
against unwanted guests.

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:05.839
But even sea cucumbers 
that lack anal teeth

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:08.559
are outfitted with tools 
to defend themselves.

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:10.809
They evade threats 
and launch counter-attacks

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:14.920
using their mutable collagenous tissue, 
or MCT.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.719
This gel-like tissue contains 
bundles of collagen, called “fibrils.”

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.509
Proteins can interact with these fibrils 
to slide them together,

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:27.409
stiffening the tissue, or apart, 
softening it.

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.489
This versatile tissue has many advantages:

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.619
it aids in efficient locomotion,

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.569
enables sea cucumbers 
to fit into small spaces,

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.339
and allows them to reproduce 
asexually by splitting apart.

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:45.276
But MCT’s most explosive application 
is employed when a predator attacks.

00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:48.036
By loosening the attachments 
of internal tissues

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:50.616
then quickly softening 
and contracting their muscles,

00:02:50.616 --> 00:02:54.046
many species are capable of shooting 
a wide range of organs

00:02:54.046 --> 00:02:55.638
out of their anuses.

00:02:55.638 --> 00:02:57.638
This act is called “evisceration”

00:02:57.638 --> 00:03:01.058
and it’s a surprisingly effective 
defense mechanism.

00:03:01.058 --> 00:03:03.988
In addition to startling 
and distracting predators,

00:03:03.988 --> 00:03:08.229
the innards of some sea cucumber 
species are sticky and toxic.

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.809
Evisceration may seem drastic,

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:14.919
but sea cucumbers are able to regenerate 
what they’ve lost to their gut reaction

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.729
in just a few weeks’ time.

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.889
Aside from the few species 
that have evolved to swim

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.719
and those that feed without moving,

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:26.132
many of these cumbersome creatures 
pass their time grazing the seabed.

00:03:26.132 --> 00:03:29.422
Sea cucumbers are found everywhere 
from shallow shores

00:03:29.422 --> 00:03:33.222
to abyssal trenches 6,000 meters 
below sea level.

00:03:33.222 --> 00:03:37.753
On the deep sea floor, they comprise 
the majority of animal biomass,

00:03:37.753 --> 00:03:41.569
reaching up to 95% in some areas.

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.154
As these sausage-shaped wonders 
trudge along, they vacuum up sand,

00:03:46.154 --> 00:03:50.456
digest the organic matter it contains, 
and excrete the byproduct.

00:03:50.456 --> 00:03:54.763
In this process, sea cucumbers clean 
and oxygenate the seafloor

00:03:54.763 --> 00:03:58.043
by breaking down detritus 
and recycling nutrients.

00:03:58.043 --> 00:04:02.790
This creates the conditions for sea grass 
beds and shellfish to thrive.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.790
Sea cucumber excretions can also aid 
in coral formation

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.585
and may play a role in buffering marine 
environments from ocean acidification.

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:15.365
As the ocean’s vacuum cleaners, 
they are very good at their job:

00:04:15.365 --> 00:04:17.295
about half of the sandy seafloor

00:04:17.295 --> 00:04:21.460
is thought to have passed through 
the digestive tract of a sea cucumber.

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.653
So next time you’re rejoicing 
in the feeling of sand

00:04:24.653 --> 00:04:27.940
crunching between your toes, 
consider this:

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.118
those very grains of sand might have, 
at one point or another,

00:04:32.118 --> 00:04:35.778
been excreted by a pickle 
that breathes through its butt.
