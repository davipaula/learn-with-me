00:00:13.063 --> 00:00:14.841
In 1989,

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:17.095
an artist by the name of Dread Scott,

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.030
who has also graced the TED stage,

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:22.453
created a piece of art in Chicago,

00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:26.109
where he simply placed
an American flag on the ground

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:30.498
and then invited you the viewer
to go and stand on that flag

00:00:30.522 --> 00:00:33.227
and record how it felt in a journal.

00:00:34.232 --> 00:00:38.756
And to me, one of the most powerful things
written in that journal, in essence, says,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.967
"Why are we so OK

00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:42.600
with homeless people,

00:00:42.624 --> 00:00:45.377
with human beings laying on the ground,

00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:47.241
but not flags?"

00:00:48.994 --> 00:00:52.119
And to some of you,
this piece of art is quite disturbing.

00:00:52.844 --> 00:00:55.322
And that's kind of the point
of this talk --

00:00:55.346 --> 00:00:58.107
not to upset you or to make you mad

00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:03.255
but to prove to you that flags
have an incredible power,

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:06.237
and that even if you think
you don't care about flags, you do.

00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:07.555
You know you do.

00:01:08.111 --> 00:01:09.262
Alright.

00:01:09.286 --> 00:01:11.588
By the end of it,
I hope that you're inspired

00:01:11.612 --> 00:01:15.090
to go out and harness this power of flags
and fight for a better world.

00:01:15.114 --> 00:01:16.954
But before we get there,

00:01:16.978 --> 00:01:19.688
we're going to start
on the opposite end of the spectrum.

00:01:20.254 --> 00:01:24.153
And before I show you the next stuff,
I need to say that anything I show here

00:01:24.177 --> 00:01:25.780
is not an endorsement,

00:01:25.804 --> 00:01:27.734
it's usually quite the opposite.

00:01:27.758 --> 00:01:31.735
But more than anything,
what I want to do is create a space here

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.850
where we can look
at these flags, these designs,

00:01:34.874 --> 00:01:37.500
and examine how they make us feel.

00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:39.915
We're going to talk about our emotions.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.567
Is that OK with everybody?

00:01:41.591 --> 00:01:42.896
OK.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.650
Are you ready for your first flag?

00:01:46.698 --> 00:01:48.476
Cool, we'll start with an easy one.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.358
That was a joke. (Laughs)

00:01:51.382 --> 00:01:56.121
So, some of you may be a little bit uneasy
sitting in a room with this.

00:01:56.145 --> 00:01:58.817
I'm certainly feeling uneasy
standing in front of it.

00:01:59.495 --> 00:02:02.303
Some of you may be feeling
a little bit of pride.

00:02:02.677 --> 00:02:07.006
And that's understandable. This is Texas.
This is not a rare sight, is it?

00:02:07.832 --> 00:02:09.395
But let's start with the facts.

00:02:09.735 --> 00:02:13.441
So this is not the Confederate flag. OK?

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:16.661
This is the battle flag
of the Army of Northern Virginia

00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:18.665
led by General Robert E. Lee.

00:02:19.244 --> 00:02:22.263
So next time someone tells you
that this is their heritage,

00:02:22.287 --> 00:02:25.247
unless their family fought
for that very specific militia,

00:02:25.271 --> 00:02:26.522
they're wrong, alright?

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:29.414
And you have a flag expert's
permission to tell them so.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.937
This flag rose into prominence
during the mid-1950s and '60s

00:02:34.961 --> 00:02:37.758
as a response to the growing
Civil Rights Movement.

00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:39.926
And then of course today,

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.222
it has come to represent
the Confederacy to most of us.

00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:48.674
But I shouldn't have to remind you
what the Confederacy is.

00:02:48.698 --> 00:02:50.150
It was a rogue nation

00:02:50.174 --> 00:02:52.961
that rose up against the United States,

00:02:52.985 --> 00:02:55.045
waged war on the US,

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.293
and at one point in time,

00:02:56.317 --> 00:02:59.687
this was one of the most
un-American things you could have.

00:03:00.248 --> 00:03:03.318
But yet, this flag is protected

00:03:03.342 --> 00:03:06.918
by the same laws that protect
the United States flag

00:03:06.942 --> 00:03:08.996
in the states of Florida, Georgia,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.495
South Carolina, Mississippi and Louisiana.

00:03:13.573 --> 00:03:16.130
But let's pick on Georgia
for a second, shall we?

00:03:16.831 --> 00:03:18.474
So in 1956,

00:03:18.498 --> 00:03:22.211
a few years after desegregation
was mandated in public schools,

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:24.620
Georgia changed their state flag to this.

00:03:26.636 --> 00:03:29.537
I think everyone watching can agree

00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:33.425
that this was not meant to be a flag
that every Georgian was proud to fly

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.000
outside of their home, was it?

00:03:35.643 --> 00:03:36.991
No.

00:03:37.015 --> 00:03:41.620
Just like all of the Confederate statues
erected in the mid-1950s and '60s,

00:03:41.644 --> 00:03:45.278
this was meant to be a symbol
of who was in charge

00:03:45.302 --> 00:03:46.792
and who was not.

00:03:47.916 --> 00:03:49.649
This remained the flag of Georgia

00:03:49.673 --> 00:03:51.892
until the year 2001,

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.294
and in that year, they changed their flag

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:56.476
to this.

00:03:57.051 --> 00:04:01.011
Now, as a flag expert, I can tell you:
this is officially ugly.

00:04:01.416 --> 00:04:03.226
OK? It's OK to laugh at this flag.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.945
It's ugly, and because it's so ugly,

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:08.936
that's one of the reasons
they changed it just two years later.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.120
They had a referendum

00:04:10.144 --> 00:04:12.299
where they got to choose
between that thing

00:04:12.323 --> 00:04:15.128
and then what is now
the current flag of Georgia.

00:04:16.194 --> 00:04:17.886
Now some of you might be wondering,

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.199
"Wait a second, Michael --

00:04:19.223 --> 00:04:21.740
if that before wasn't
the Confederate flag,

00:04:21.764 --> 00:04:24.134
what was the Confederate flag?"

00:04:26.174 --> 00:04:30.482
Georgia flies the first flag
of the Confederate States of America

00:04:30.506 --> 00:04:31.731
to this day.

00:04:32.094 --> 00:04:34.484
They just slapped their state seal on it.

00:04:35.345 --> 00:04:37.663
Well, let's go back
to our emotions for a second.

00:04:37.687 --> 00:04:41.726
That didn't punch you in the gut
as much as the other one did, did it?

00:04:42.351 --> 00:04:43.505
Right?

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:45.813
And that's why I love flags.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.026
They are the simplest pieces of design,

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.528
usually just two or three colors,

00:04:51.552 --> 00:04:53.726
just some bars or stripes.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.720
But yet, they can invoke
the deepest emotions within us.

00:04:57.744 --> 00:05:00.543
They'll make us swell with pride

00:05:00.567 --> 00:05:02.250
or burn with hatred.

00:05:03.055 --> 00:05:05.050
We will die for a flag

00:05:05.617 --> 00:05:07.334
or even kill for one.

00:05:08.873 --> 00:05:11.901
One of my favorite designers,
his name is Wally Olins,

00:05:11.925 --> 00:05:14.689
they call him the father
of nation branding,

00:05:14.713 --> 00:05:16.402
and he's quoted as saying

00:05:16.426 --> 00:05:19.299
that "Everyone wants to belong,

00:05:19.323 --> 00:05:22.420
and then they want to display
symbols of belonging."

00:05:23.403 --> 00:05:27.867
And it's crazy that these pieces of cloth
that are just sewn together or dyed

00:05:27.891 --> 00:05:30.916
come to be such a sacred item,

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.857
and that's because they become
parts of our identity.

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:37.230
They are powerful tools to unify

00:05:38.047 --> 00:05:40.779
but equally powerful tools to divide.

00:05:42.056 --> 00:05:43.487
You ready for the next flag?

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.769
Right.

00:05:46.793 --> 00:05:48.196
Take a moment.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.433
Really examine how you felt
when this hit the screen.

00:05:52.488 --> 00:05:54.569
I'm going to change
the slide pretty quickly

00:05:54.593 --> 00:05:57.151
so you don't take pictures of me
in front of this one.

00:05:57.175 --> 00:05:58.176
(Laughter)

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.351
Alright?

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:02.293
So Germany after World War I,

00:06:02.317 --> 00:06:04.323
it was in a pretty bad state,

00:06:04.347 --> 00:06:09.171
and a young Adolf Hitler had a lot of --
let's call them -- "ideas,"

00:06:09.195 --> 00:06:12.006
of how Germany got to where they'd gotten

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.415
and how to get them out.

00:06:13.861 --> 00:06:16.999
He spent entire chapters
in his book "Mein Kampf,"

00:06:17.023 --> 00:06:18.722
which I don't recommend reading,

00:06:18.746 --> 00:06:20.796
about how Germany lost World War I

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.780
partially because the British
had better graphic design

00:06:24.804 --> 00:06:26.365
and better propaganda.

00:06:27.318 --> 00:06:29.702
So, as the Nazi Party rose,

00:06:29.726 --> 00:06:33.735
Hitler created one of the thickest
brand guides I've ever seen.

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:36.159
It's thicker than most
company brand guides today,

00:06:36.183 --> 00:06:39.572
and in it, he details titles and uniforms

00:06:39.596 --> 00:06:41.853
and lots and lots of flags.

00:06:42.716 --> 00:06:44.316
Hitler knew the power of flags.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.328
He says in "Mein Kampf,"

00:06:46.352 --> 00:06:49.169
"The new flag ... should prove
effective as a large poster,

00:06:49.193 --> 00:06:51.590
[because] in hundreds
of thousands of cases

00:06:51.614 --> 00:06:54.437
a really striking emblem
may be the first cause

00:06:54.461 --> 00:06:57.195
of awakening interest
in a movement."

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:00.038
He was an artist, after all.

00:07:00.062 --> 00:07:04.148
He knew the power
of visual identity and uniforms

00:07:04.172 --> 00:07:06.885
could reignite the German identity.

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:10.814
And to millions of Germans,
this was a welcome sign.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:15.720
But of course, this was also
a mark of death to others.

00:07:16.897 --> 00:07:20.293
We don't often think of flags as weapons,

00:07:21.233 --> 00:07:23.169
but like the Confederate battle flag,

00:07:23.193 --> 00:07:25.205
the Germans used their flag

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:28.895
to make an out-group feel unwelcome

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:30.195
and less than.

00:07:31.151 --> 00:07:34.185
You see, when you create a flag,
you immediately do two things:

00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:35.662
you create an in-group,

00:07:35.686 --> 00:07:38.164
a group that's meant
to be represented by the symbol,

00:07:38.188 --> 00:07:40.350
but then, inevitably,
you create an out-group.

00:07:40.374 --> 00:07:42.124
And usually, that's subtle.

00:07:42.148 --> 00:07:43.348
It's a byproduct.

00:07:43.372 --> 00:07:45.149
It's usually not the intent.

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:49.699
But the Germans were very clear
as to who was represented by the swastika

00:07:49.723 --> 00:07:51.053
and who was not.

00:07:51.945 --> 00:07:56.920
In 1935, Jewish people were banned
from flying German flags.

00:07:58.246 --> 00:07:59.866
And in this way,

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.587
the Germans, maybe more than
any other time in history,

00:08:03.611 --> 00:08:05.661
used the dual power of flags

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:09.328
to unite but also to divide.

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:12.207
Flags were used as identity weapons.

00:08:12.969 --> 00:08:17.240
And now, in 2019, the Nazi flag
is banned from being flown

00:08:17.264 --> 00:08:18.943
by anyone in Germany

00:08:18.967 --> 00:08:22.279
and anyone in Austria, in Hungary,
in Russia and in Ukraine.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.187
Think about that.

00:08:24.211 --> 00:08:26.334
It's a piece of cloth, but it's banned.

00:08:27.031 --> 00:08:28.925
On its face, that sounds crazy.

00:08:29.846 --> 00:08:32.469
But I don't think anyone
in this room would disagree

00:08:32.493 --> 00:08:33.922
that it's probably good.

00:08:34.796 --> 00:08:36.480
Sounds a lot like a weapon.

00:08:38.383 --> 00:08:39.839
As a vexillologist,

00:08:39.863 --> 00:08:42.544
sometimes the most interesting
thing about a flag

00:08:42.568 --> 00:08:44.329
is not so much its design,

00:08:45.184 --> 00:08:47.955
but it's those laws around the flag.

00:08:48.453 --> 00:08:49.953
For instance,

00:08:49.977 --> 00:08:53.318
in India, to create an Indian flag,

00:08:53.342 --> 00:08:56.771
you must use a hand-spun
cloth named "khadi."

00:08:57.312 --> 00:08:59.554
If you make a flag out of anything else,

00:08:59.578 --> 00:09:02.569
you could go to jail
for up to three years.

00:09:03.212 --> 00:09:04.389
It's crazy.

00:09:04.413 --> 00:09:06.254
Here in Texas,

00:09:06.278 --> 00:09:08.255
we've all heard

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:11.807
that the Texas flag is the only state flag
that can fly at the same height

00:09:11.831 --> 00:09:13.006
as the US, flag, right?

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.434
Because we were a nation
before we were a state.

00:09:15.458 --> 00:09:16.709
Who here has heard that?

00:09:17.225 --> 00:09:18.376
Yeah.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:22.095
Well, I'm here to tell you
that is completely false. OK?

00:09:22.119 --> 00:09:26.746
First of all, we were not the only state
that was a nation before joining up.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.824
And secondly, all state flags can fly
at the same height as the US flag

00:09:30.848 --> 00:09:33.015
according to the US flag code.

00:09:34.295 --> 00:09:37.292
And I don't have to ask you
how you feel about this one, right?

00:09:37.316 --> 00:09:40.452
Most of us grew up pledging allegiance
to this every morning,

00:09:40.476 --> 00:09:43.649
knowing we should never
let it touch the ground, etc.

00:09:43.673 --> 00:09:47.953
We take our flag code very seriously
here in the United States.

00:09:48.978 --> 00:09:53.166
You remember, recently some NFL players
kneeling during the national anthem.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.557
It was a big controversy.

00:09:54.986 --> 00:09:56.899
They were breaking the flag code.

00:09:56.923 --> 00:09:58.796
It states during the national anthem,

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.275
stand at attention,
hand at the heart, etc.

00:10:01.299 --> 00:10:04.088
But what was fascinating to me
as a vexillologist

00:10:04.112 --> 00:10:07.445
is that I didn't see
anyone getting upset

00:10:07.469 --> 00:10:09.069
when something like this happens.

00:10:09.597 --> 00:10:13.665
The flag code says, "The flag should never
be carried flat or horizontally,

00:10:13.689 --> 00:10:15.643
but always aloft and free."

00:10:15.667 --> 00:10:18.283
So sometimes during
the exact same national anthem,

00:10:18.307 --> 00:10:20.201
this was being done,
and no one's upset.

00:10:21.071 --> 00:10:23.399
Or this. This happens all the time.

00:10:23.423 --> 00:10:24.588
The flag code is clear:

00:10:24.612 --> 00:10:29.600
"No part of the flag should ever be used
as a costume or on an athletic uniform."

00:10:30.299 --> 00:10:32.027
This is Texas A&amp;M baseball,

00:10:32.051 --> 00:10:34.976
not to get them in trouble,
but this happens all the time,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.795
especially in November.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.508
I'm sure, I can almost guarantee
when you leave here tonight,

00:10:40.532 --> 00:10:42.911
you will see on the back
of someone's car or truck

00:10:42.935 --> 00:10:45.353
a black and white American flag
with a blue stripe,

00:10:45.377 --> 00:10:46.550
a thin blue line, right?

00:10:46.574 --> 00:10:48.142
Blue Lives Matter.

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:51.289
That breaks the flag code
in multiple ways.

00:10:51.313 --> 00:10:54.933
But all of these things are done
with the best intent.

00:10:54.957 --> 00:10:56.696
No one's here to argue that.

00:10:57.352 --> 00:10:59.805
But of course they break
a section of the flag code

00:10:59.829 --> 00:11:02.011
titled "Respect for the Flag,"

00:11:02.035 --> 00:11:03.759
so by putting this on your uniform,

00:11:03.783 --> 00:11:07.580
you are legally disrespecting the flag.

00:11:08.973 --> 00:11:10.335
And what I find interesting

00:11:10.359 --> 00:11:12.844
is that those NFL players
kneeling during the anthem

00:11:12.868 --> 00:11:16.142
and the people who would put
Blue Lives Matters stickers on their car

00:11:16.166 --> 00:11:18.982
are both on the opposite end
of a very big issue,

00:11:19.777 --> 00:11:22.692
but they're both breaking
the exact same law,

00:11:23.707 --> 00:11:27.962
a law that is 100 percent unenforceable.

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:33.639
In fact, it was Dread Scott's
piece of art in 1989

00:11:33.663 --> 00:11:37.681
that led the Supreme Court to rule
that the flag code is just a guideline.

00:11:37.705 --> 00:11:40.194
You cannot be prosecuted
for breaking the flag code.

00:11:40.218 --> 00:11:42.680
You cannot be forced to be patriotic.

00:11:44.091 --> 00:11:49.016
So why, then, have all of these
little laws around how we use our flag

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.724
if you can't enforce them?

00:11:51.966 --> 00:11:55.012
And that's because a nation

00:11:55.036 --> 00:11:57.166
is a fragile collective idea.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.880
It only exists in our minds.

00:12:00.798 --> 00:12:02.401
Can I see this? Thank you.

00:12:03.945 --> 00:12:09.741
Sometimes a flag is the only
tangible symbol of that idea.

00:12:10.393 --> 00:12:15.628
Right? Our unity is sometimes
only held together by literal threads.

00:12:16.648 --> 00:12:17.973
And that's powerful.

00:12:18.591 --> 00:12:22.912
The flag code is meant to preserve
and protect that fragile idea,

00:12:22.936 --> 00:12:26.056
while also protecting
your right to break it.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.002
And that's what's special
about the United States, right?

00:12:30.026 --> 00:12:31.970
And that's what's unique about our flag.

00:12:31.994 --> 00:12:33.702
Our flag is amazing.

00:12:33.726 --> 00:12:37.253
It has changed more than
any other flag in the world.

00:12:37.277 --> 00:12:40.770
It's the flag code that says
when a new state is created,

00:12:40.794 --> 00:12:43.042
a star shall be added
to the union of the flag,

00:12:43.066 --> 00:12:47.280
and such addition shall take place
on the fourth day of July.

00:12:48.216 --> 00:12:52.710
Our flag is unique because
it is meant to grow as we grow.

00:12:53.218 --> 00:12:55.126
By design and by law,

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:57.508
it is meant to change with us.

00:12:57.532 --> 00:13:00.410
It's a living symbol of our individuality,

00:13:00.434 --> 00:13:02.879
our diversity in the stars

00:13:02.903 --> 00:13:04.219
and our unity.

00:13:04.916 --> 00:13:10.142
We have a gift in the United States
to have a flag that is inclusive.

00:13:10.166 --> 00:13:12.996
If the Nazi flag was an identity weapon,

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:18.350
the United States flag, by design alone,
stands in direct contrast.

00:13:19.053 --> 00:13:22.514
And I have to say,
as a vexillologist in 2019,

00:13:22.538 --> 00:13:24.102
using this flag

00:13:24.126 --> 00:13:27.099
as an identity weapon against anyone

00:13:27.123 --> 00:13:30.477
disrespects it far more
than letting it touch the ground

00:13:30.501 --> 00:13:33.969
or any one of the other little laws
that we break every day.

00:13:34.706 --> 00:13:35.987
Right?

00:13:38.058 --> 00:13:41.619
This flag is a symbol of our unity.

00:13:42.253 --> 00:13:45.531
We should never use this as a weapon
against someone else.

00:13:45.555 --> 00:13:50.258
I resonate so deeply with the person
who wrote in Dread Scott's journal,

00:13:50.282 --> 00:13:54.698
"We should never value the symbol
over the thing that it symbolizes.

00:13:54.722 --> 00:13:58.916
We should never value a piece of cloth
over a human life."

00:14:00.032 --> 00:14:02.907
And if you're ever going to use
a piece of cloth as a weapon,

00:14:02.931 --> 00:14:04.618
you should never use this one,

00:14:04.642 --> 00:14:08.361
not when it has always
had room for more stars.

00:14:08.822 --> 00:14:12.009
Hopefully by now, you've felt
the power of flags,

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:15.031
and you can see what they can do.

00:14:15.583 --> 00:14:17.850
So what if we harnessed that power,

00:14:17.874 --> 00:14:20.639
and we used it to fight
for something greater?

00:14:22.679 --> 00:14:25.096
This is the flag of Earth,

00:14:25.986 --> 00:14:28.861
designed by Oskar Pernefeldt of Sweden.

00:14:29.653 --> 00:14:32.256
Just imagine with me for a second:

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.853
What if we celebrated our humanity

00:14:35.877 --> 00:14:37.744
as much if not more

00:14:37.768 --> 00:14:40.392
than we celebrate our nationalities?

00:14:40.999 --> 00:14:45.420
As we become a spacefaring civilization
and we go off into the stars,

00:14:45.444 --> 00:14:47.385
what do our nations mean anyway

00:14:47.409 --> 00:14:50.706
when you're standing on the surface
of Mars or any other planet?

00:14:51.682 --> 00:14:53.593
And then of course, back here on Earth,

00:14:54.696 --> 00:14:57.601
as our planet is facing a climate crisis,

00:14:57.625 --> 00:15:02.174
as our climate could be unlivable in
our children or grandchildren's lifetime,

00:15:02.198 --> 00:15:06.400
I believe we need a strong symbol, a flag,

00:15:06.424 --> 00:15:08.507
to unite us to fight,

00:15:08.531 --> 00:15:10.439
not just as nations,

00:15:10.463 --> 00:15:12.317
but as a species.

00:15:13.349 --> 00:15:14.612
Thank you.

00:15:14.636 --> 00:15:16.962
(Applause)
