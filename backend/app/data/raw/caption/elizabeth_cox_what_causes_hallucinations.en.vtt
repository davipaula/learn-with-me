00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.020
An elderly woman named Rosalie 
was sitting in her nursing home

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.291
when her room suddenly burst 
to life with twirling fabrics.

00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:16.022
Through the elaborate drapings,

00:00:16.022 --> 00:00:17.457
she could make out animals,

00:00:17.457 --> 00:00:18.213
children,

00:00:18.213 --> 00:00:20.035
and costumed characters.

00:00:20.035 --> 00:00:22.709
Rosalie was alarmed,
not by the intrusion,

00:00:22.709 --> 00:00:27.800
but because she knew this entourage 
was an extremely detailed hallucination.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.163
Her cognitive function was excellent,

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:34.642
and she had not taken any medications 
that might cause hallucinations.

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:39.662
Strangest of all, had a real-life crowd 
of circus performers burst into her room,

00:00:39.662 --> 00:00:41.741
she wouldn’t have been able to see them:

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:44.249
she was completely blind.

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:48.439
Rosalie had developed a condition known 
as Charles Bonnet Syndrome,

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:52.127
in which patients with either impaired 
vision or total blindness

00:00:52.127 --> 00:00:55.545
suddenly hallucinate whole scenes 
in vivid color.

00:00:55.545 --> 00:00:57.987
These hallucinations appear suddenly,

00:00:57.987 --> 00:01:02.107
and can last for mere minutes 
or recur for years.

00:01:02.107 --> 00:01:05.621
We still don’t fully understand 
what causes them to come and go,

00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:08.778
or why certain patients develop them 
when others don’t.

00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:13.011
We do know from fMRI studies 
that these hallucinations

00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:15.519
activate the same brain areas as sight,

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:20.023
areas that are not activated 
by imagination.

00:01:20.023 --> 00:01:22.905
Many other hallucinations, 
including smells,

00:01:22.905 --> 00:01:23.785
sights,

00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:24.758
and sounds,

00:01:24.758 --> 00:01:29.428
also involve the same brain areas 
as real sensory experiences.

00:01:29.428 --> 00:01:35.626
Because of this, the cerebral cortex is
thought to play a part in hallucinations.

00:01:35.626 --> 00:01:39.533
This thin layer of grey matter 
covers the entire cerebrum,

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:44.169
with different areas processing 
information from each of our senses.

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:47.110
But even in people
with completely unimpaired senses,

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.840
the brain constructs the world we perceive
from incomplete information.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.130
For example, our eyes have blind spots

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.091
where the optic nerve 
blocks part of the retina.

00:01:57.091 --> 00:02:00.893
When the visual cortex processes light 
into coherent images,

00:02:00.893 --> 00:02:05.529
it fills in these blind spots with 
information from the surrounding area.

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:10.462
Occasionally, we might notice a glitch,
but most of the time we’re none the wiser.

00:02:10.462 --> 00:02:15.678
When the visual cortex is deprived 
of input from the eyes, even temporarily,

00:02:15.678 --> 00:02:18.810
the brain still tries 
to create a coherent picture,

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.953
but the limits of its abilities 
become a lot more obvious.

00:02:22.953 --> 00:02:27.971
The full-blown hallucinations of
Charles Bonnet Syndrome are one example.

00:02:27.971 --> 00:02:30.595
Because Charles Bonnet Syndrome 
only occurs in people

00:02:30.595 --> 00:02:33.572
who had normal vision 
and then lost their sight,

00:02:33.572 --> 00:02:35.311
not those who were born blind,

00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:38.299
scientists think the brain uses
remembered images

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.922
to compensate for 
the lack of new visual input.

00:02:41.922 --> 00:02:44.067
And the same is true for other senses.

00:02:44.067 --> 00:02:47.978
People with hearing loss 
often hallucinate music or voices,

00:02:47.978 --> 00:02:52.929
sometimes as elaborate as the cacophony 
of an entire marching band.

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:55.662
In addition to sensory deprivation,

00:02:55.662 --> 00:02:57.941
recreational and therapeutic drugs,

00:02:57.941 --> 00:03:00.859
conditions like epilepsy and narcolepsy,

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.635
and psychiatric disorders 
like schizophrenia,

00:03:03.635 --> 00:03:06.996
are a few of the many known causes 
of hallucinations,

00:03:06.996 --> 00:03:09.229
and we’re still finding new ones.

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:11.619
Some of the most notorious hallucinations

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:15.472
are associated with drugs 
like LSD and psilocybin.

00:03:15.472 --> 00:03:20.399
Their hallmark effects include 
the sensation that dry objects are wet

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:23.068
and that surfaces are breathing.

00:03:23.068 --> 00:03:26.978
At higher doses, the visual world 
can appear to melt,

00:03:26.978 --> 00:03:28.318
dissolve into swirls,

00:03:28.318 --> 00:03:31.340
or burst into fractal-like patterns.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.521
Evidence suggests these drugs also 
act on the cerebral cortex.

00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:39.900
But while visual impairment typically 
only causes visual hallucinations,

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.794
and hearing loss auditory ones,

00:03:41.794 --> 00:03:48.390
substances like LSD cause perceptual
disturbances across all the senses.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.115
That’s likely because they activate 
receptors in a broad range of brain areas,

00:03:53.115 --> 00:03:56.653
including the cortical regions 
for all the senses.

00:03:56.653 --> 00:04:00.679
LSD and psilocybin both function 
like serotonin in the brain,

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:05.063
binding directly to one type of
serotonin receptor in particular.

00:04:05.063 --> 00:04:08.990
While serotonin’s role in the brain 
is complex and poorly understood,

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.596
it likely plays an important part 
in integrating information

00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:13.378
from the eyes,

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:14.111
nose,

00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:14.881
ears,

00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:16.743
and other sensory organs.

00:04:16.743 --> 00:04:21.022
So one theory is that LSD and psilocybin
cause hallucinations

00:04:21.022 --> 00:04:25.243
by disrupting the signaling 
involved in sensory integration.

00:04:25.243 --> 00:04:27.943
Hallucinations associated 
with schizophrenia

00:04:27.943 --> 00:04:33.374
may share a similar mechanism with those
caused by LSD and psilocybin.

00:04:33.374 --> 00:04:35.031
Patients with schizophrenia

00:04:35.031 --> 00:04:38.008
often have elevated levels 
of serotonin in the brain.

00:04:38.008 --> 00:04:42.209
And antipsychotic drugs relieve 
symptoms of schizophrenia

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:47.612
by blocking the same serotonin 
receptors LSD and psilocybin bind to.

00:04:47.612 --> 00:04:49.117
And, in some cases,

00:04:49.117 --> 00:04:51.684
these drugs can even relieve 
the hallucinations

00:04:51.684 --> 00:04:54.282
of patients with Charles Bonnet Syndrome.

00:04:54.282 --> 00:04:57.848
We’re still a long way from understanding 
all the different causes

00:04:57.848 --> 00:05:01.234
and interconnected mechanisms 
of hallucinations.

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:03.698
But it’s clear that 
hallucinatory experiences

00:05:03.698 --> 00:05:08.361
are much more closely tied to ordinary
perception than we once thought.

00:05:08.361 --> 00:05:09.871
And by studying hallucinations,

00:05:09.871 --> 00:05:11.453
we stand to learn a great deal

00:05:11.453 --> 00:05:14.377
about how our brains construct 
the world we see,

00:05:14.377 --> 00:05:15.086
hear,

00:05:15.086 --> 00:05:15.918
smell,

00:05:15.918 --> 00:05:17.220
and touch.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.147
As we learn more,

00:05:18.147 --> 00:05:22.248
we’ll likely come to appreciate
just how subjective and individual

00:05:22.248 --> 00:05:26.435
each person’s island universe 
of perception really is.
