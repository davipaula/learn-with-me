00:00:07.052 --> 00:00:10.572
It’s June, just after a heavy rainfall,

00:00:10.572 --> 00:00:16.364
and the sky is filling with creatures 
we wouldn’t normally expect to find there.

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:19.444
At first glance,
this might be a disturbing sight.

00:00:19.444 --> 00:00:23.925
But for the lucky males and females 
of Solenopsis invicta,

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:29.077
otherwise known as fire ants, 
it’s a day of romance.

00:00:29.077 --> 00:00:31.007
This is the nuptial flight,

00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:34.925
when thousands of reproduction-capable 
male and female ants,

00:00:34.925 --> 00:00:39.492
called alates, 
take wing for the first and last time.

00:00:39.492 --> 00:00:44.032
But even for successful males 
who manage to avoid winged predators,

00:00:44.032 --> 00:00:47.197
this mating frenzy will prove lethal.

00:00:47.197 --> 00:00:52.541
And for a successfully mated female, 
her work is only beginning.

00:00:52.541 --> 00:00:57.069
Having secured a lifetime supply of sperm 
from her departed mate,

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:02.047
our new queen must now single-handedly 
start an entire colony.

00:01:02.047 --> 00:01:03.497
Descending to the ground,

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:06.674
she searches for a suitable spot 
to build her nest.

00:01:06.674 --> 00:01:10.868
Ideally, she can find somewhere 
with loose, easy-to-dig soil—

00:01:10.868 --> 00:01:14.616
like farmland 
already disturbed by human activity.

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:18.864
Once she finds the perfect spot, 
she breaks off her wings—

00:01:18.864 --> 00:01:22.916
creating the stubs 
that establish her royal status.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:27.956
Then, she starts digging 
a descending tunnel ending in a chamber.

00:01:27.956 --> 00:01:32.337
Here the queen begins laying her eggs, 
about ten per day,

00:01:32.337 --> 00:01:35.707
and the first larvae hatch within a week.

00:01:35.707 --> 00:01:37.240
Over the next three weeks,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.740
the new queen relies on a separate batch 
of unfertilized eggs

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.497
to nourish both herself and her brood,

00:01:44.497 --> 00:01:47.820
losing half her body weight 
in the process.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.260
Thankfully, after about 20 days,

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.290
these larvae grow 
into the first generation of workers,

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.610
ready to forage for food 
and sustain their shrunken queen.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.007
Her daughters 
will have to work quickly though—

00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:04.220
returning their mother 
to good health is urgent.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.780
In the surrounding area,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.651
dozens of neighboring queens 
are building their own ant armies.

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:14.101
These colonies 
have peacefully coexisted so far,

00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:16.205
but once workers appear,

00:02:16.205 --> 00:02:20.075
a phenomenon known as brood-raiding 
begins.

00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:23.269
Workers from nests 
up to several meters away

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.055
begin to steal offspring 
from our queen.

00:02:26.055 --> 00:02:27.905
Our colony retaliates,

00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:31.235
but new waves of raiders 
from even further away

00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:33.235
overwhelm the workers.

00:02:33.235 --> 00:02:37.866
Within hours, the raiders have taken 
our queen’s entire brood supply

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:40.076
to the largest nearby nest—

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:44.145
and the queen’s surviving daughters 
abandon her.

00:02:44.145 --> 00:02:46.410
Chasing her last chance of survival,

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.155
the queen follows the raiding trail 
to the winning nest.

00:02:50.155 --> 00:02:54.792
She fends off other losing queens 
and the defending nest’s workers,

00:02:54.792 --> 00:02:58.013
fighting her way 
to the top of the brood pile.

00:02:58.013 --> 00:03:01.872
Her daughters help their mother succeed 
where other queens fail—

00:03:01.872 --> 00:03:05.972
defeating the reigning monarch, 
and usurping the brood pile.

00:03:05.972 --> 00:03:08.630
Eventually, 
all the remaining challengers fail,

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.262
until only one queen— 
and one brood pile— remains.

00:03:13.262 --> 00:03:18.466
Now presiding over several hundred workers
in the neighborhood’s largest nest,

00:03:18.466 --> 00:03:23.283
our victorious queen begins 
aiding her colony in its primary goal:

00:03:23.283 --> 00:03:24.763
reproduction.

00:03:24.763 --> 00:03:30.006
For the next several years, 
the colony only produces sterile workers.

00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:33.996
But once their population 
exceeds about 23,000,

00:03:33.996 --> 00:03:35.675
it changes course.

00:03:35.675 --> 00:03:37.722
From now on, every spring,

00:03:37.722 --> 00:03:41.692
the colony will produce 
fertile alate males and females.

00:03:41.692 --> 00:03:45.875
The colony spawns these larger ants 
throughout the early summer,

00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:48.966
and returns to worker production 
in the fall.

00:03:48.966 --> 00:03:52.792
After heavy rainfalls, 
these alates take to the skies,

00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:57.782
and spread their queen’s genes 
up to a couple hundred meters downwind.

00:03:57.782 --> 00:04:01.122
But to contribute 
to this annual mating frenzy,

00:04:01.122 --> 00:04:06.036
the colony must continue to thrive 
as one massive super-organism.

00:04:06.036 --> 00:04:10.126
Every day, younger ants feed the queen 
and tend to the brood,

00:04:10.126 --> 00:04:14.311
while older workers 
forage for food and defend the nest.

00:04:14.311 --> 00:04:15.905
When intruders strike,

00:04:15.905 --> 00:04:20.087
these older warriors fend them off 
using poisonous venom.

00:04:20.087 --> 00:04:22.659
After rainfalls, 
the colony comes together,

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:26.067
using the wet dirt to expand their nest.

00:04:26.067 --> 00:04:28.887
And when a disastrous flood 
drowns their home,

00:04:28.887 --> 00:04:32.957
the sisters band together 
into a massive living raft—

00:04:32.957 --> 00:04:35.622
carrying their queen to safety.

00:04:35.622 --> 00:04:37.247
But no matter how resilient,

00:04:37.247 --> 00:04:40.234
the life of a colony must come to an end.

00:04:40.234 --> 00:04:43.585
After about 8 years, 
our queen runs out of sperm

00:04:43.585 --> 00:04:46.986
and can no longer replace dying workers.

00:04:46.986 --> 00:04:49.626
The nest’s population dwindles, 
and eventually,

00:04:49.626 --> 00:04:52.396
they’re taken over 
by a neighboring colony.

00:04:52.396 --> 00:04:57.036
Our queen’s reign is over, 
but her genetic legacy lives on.
