00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:13.969
I was only nine

00:00:13.993 --> 00:00:18.916
when my grandfather first described to me
the horrors he witnessed six years earlier

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.844
when human stampedes killed 39 people

00:00:21.868 --> 00:00:23.884
in our hometown of Nashik, India.

00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:27.750
It was during the 2003 Nashik Kumbh Mela,

00:00:27.774 --> 00:00:30.746
one of the world's largest
religious gatherings.

00:00:31.213 --> 00:00:34.943
Every 12 years,
over 30 million Hindu worshippers

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:36.546
descend upon our city --

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.410
which is built
only for 1.5 million people --

00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:41.077
and stay for 45 days.

00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:44.672
The main purpose
is to wash away all their sins

00:00:44.696 --> 00:00:47.021
by bathing in the river Godavari.

00:00:47.807 --> 00:00:50.045
And stampedes may easily happen

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:53.346
because a high-density crowd
moves at a slow pace.

00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:58.311
Apart from Nashik, this event happens
in three other places in India,

00:00:58.335 --> 00:01:00.054
with varying frequency,

00:01:00.078 --> 00:01:02.847
and between 2001 and 2014,

00:01:02.871 --> 00:01:08.369
over 2,400 lives have been lost
in stampedes at these events.

00:01:09.362 --> 00:01:11.219
What saddened me the most

00:01:11.243 --> 00:01:15.758
is seeing people around me
resigning to the city's fate

00:01:15.782 --> 00:01:19.607
in witnessing the seemingly
inevitable deaths of dozens

00:01:19.631 --> 00:01:20.908
at every Kumbh Mela.

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:22.878
I sought to change this,

00:01:22.902 --> 00:01:25.877
and I thought, why can't I try
to find a solution to this?

00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:27.389
Because I knew it is wrong.

00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:31.153
Having learned coding at an early age
and being a maker,

00:01:31.177 --> 00:01:32.845
I considered the wild idea --

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.057
(Laughter)

00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:35.466
[Makers always find a way]

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.555
I considered the wild idea
of building a system

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.041
that would help regulate
the flow of people

00:01:41.065 --> 00:01:44.054
and use it in the next Kumbh Mela in 2015,

00:01:44.078 --> 00:01:47.683
to have fewer stampedes
and, hopefully, fewer deaths.

00:01:48.177 --> 00:01:50.648
It seemed like a mission impossible,

00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:52.440
a dream too big,

00:01:52.464 --> 00:01:54.645
especially for a 15-year-old,

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:58.208
yet that dream came true in 2015,

00:01:58.232 --> 00:02:01.925
when not only did we succeed

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:04.901
in reducing the stampedes
and their intensity,

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:07.102
but we marked 2015

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:11.133
as the first Nashik Kumbh Mela
to have zero stampedes.

00:02:11.596 --> 00:02:16.934
(Applause)

00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.444
It was the first time in recorded history

00:02:19.468 --> 00:02:22.214
that this event
passed without any casualties.

00:02:22.888 --> 00:02:24.038
How did we do it?

00:02:24.623 --> 00:02:27.654
It all started when I joined
an innovation workshop

00:02:27.678 --> 00:02:30.354
by MIT Media Lab in 2014

00:02:30.378 --> 00:02:32.347
called the Kumbhathon

00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:36.775
that aimed at solving challenges
faced at the grand scale of Kumbh Mela.

00:02:37.784 --> 00:02:42.292
Now, we figured out to solve
the stampede problem,

00:02:42.316 --> 00:02:44.480
we wanted to know only three things:

00:02:44.504 --> 00:02:47.243
the number of people, the location,

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:50.726
and the rate of the flow
of people per minute.

00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:55.370
So we started to look for technologies
that would help us get these three things.

00:02:56.091 --> 00:03:00.345
Can we distribute radio-frequency tokens
to identify people?

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:03.782
We figured out that it would
be too expensive and impractical

00:03:03.806 --> 00:03:05.742
to distribute 30 million tags.

00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:09.926
Can you use CCTV cameras
with image-processing techniques?

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.997
Again, too expensive for that scale,

00:03:12.021 --> 00:03:14.899
along with the disadvantages
of being non-portable

00:03:14.923 --> 00:03:17.741
and being completely useless
in the case of rain,

00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:20.147
which is a common thing
to happen in Kumbh Mela.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.445
Can we use cell phone tower data?

00:03:23.806 --> 00:03:26.273
It sounds like the perfect solution,

00:03:26.297 --> 00:03:28.070
but the funny part is,

00:03:28.094 --> 00:03:30.839
most of the people
do not carry cell phones

00:03:30.863 --> 00:03:32.347
in events like Kumbh Mela.

00:03:32.887 --> 00:03:36.601
Also, the data wouldn't have been
granular enough for us.

00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:39.078
So we wanted something that was real-time,

00:03:39.102 --> 00:03:42.419
low-cost, sturdy and waterproof,

00:03:42.443 --> 00:03:44.854
and it was easy to get
the data for processing.

00:03:45.672 --> 00:03:48.028
So we built Ashioto,

00:03:48.052 --> 00:03:50.137
meaning "footstep" in Japanese,

00:03:50.161 --> 00:03:54.346
as it consists of a portable mat
which has pressure sensors

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.861
which can count the number
of people walking on it,

00:03:56.885 --> 00:03:59.317
and sends the data over the internet

00:03:59.341 --> 00:04:01.888
to the advanced data analysis
software we created.

00:04:02.483 --> 00:04:05.771
The possible errors,
like overcounting or double-stepping,

00:04:05.795 --> 00:04:08.445
were overcome using design interventions.

00:04:08.803 --> 00:04:12.329
The optimum breadth of the mat
was determined to be 18 inches,

00:04:12.353 --> 00:04:14.592
after we tested many different versions

00:04:14.616 --> 00:04:17.203
and observed the average
stride length of a person.

00:04:18.111 --> 00:04:21.016
Otherwise, people might step
over the sensor.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.612
We started with a proof of concept
built in three days,

00:04:23.636 --> 00:04:26.510
made out of cardboard and aluminum foil.

00:04:26.534 --> 00:04:27.535
(Laughter)

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:29.933
It worked, for real.

00:04:29.957 --> 00:04:32.647
We built another one
with aluminum composite panels

00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:34.309
and piezoelectric plates,

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:37.904
which are plates that generate a small
pulse of electricity under pressure.

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:42.228
We tested this at 30 different
pilots in public,

00:04:42.252 --> 00:04:45.974
in crowded restaurants,
in malls, in temples, etc.,

00:04:45.998 --> 00:04:47.632
to see how people reacted.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.743
And people let us run these pilots

00:04:50.767 --> 00:04:57.243
because they were excited to see localites
work on problems for the city.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.799
I was 15 and my team members
were in their early 20s.

00:05:01.736 --> 00:05:06.227
When the sensors were colored,

00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:09.092
people would get scared
and would ask us questions like,

00:05:09.116 --> 00:05:11.323
"Will I get electrocuted
if I step on this?"

00:05:11.347 --> 00:05:12.348
(Laughter)

00:05:12.372 --> 00:05:16.744
Or, if it was very obvious that it was
an electronic sensor on the ground,

00:05:16.768 --> 00:05:18.261
they would just jump over it.

00:05:18.285 --> 00:05:19.361
(Laughter)

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:22.449
So we decided to design
a cover for the sensor

00:05:22.473 --> 00:05:25.530
so that people don't have to worry
what it is on the ground.

00:05:25.554 --> 00:05:27.530
So after some experimentation,

00:05:27.554 --> 00:05:30.364
we decided to use an industrial sensor,

00:05:30.388 --> 00:05:33.357
used as a safety trigger
in hazardous areas

00:05:33.381 --> 00:05:34.532
as the sensor,

00:05:34.556 --> 00:05:36.637
and a black neoprene rubber sheet

00:05:36.661 --> 00:05:37.903
as the cover.

00:05:38.374 --> 00:05:41.191
Now, another added benefit
of using black rubber

00:05:41.215 --> 00:05:44.842
was that dust naturally
accumulates over the surface,

00:05:44.866 --> 00:05:47.516
eventually camouflaging it
with the ground.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.652
We also had to make sure that the sensor
is no higher than 12 millimeters.

00:05:53.206 --> 00:05:55.435
Otherwise, people might trip over it,

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:57.364
which in itself would cause stampedes.

00:05:57.792 --> 00:06:01.579
(Laughter)

00:06:01.603 --> 00:06:02.965
We don't want that.

00:06:02.989 --> 00:06:04.778
(Laughter)

00:06:04.802 --> 00:06:08.881
So we were able to design a sensor
which was only 10 millimeters thick.

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.709
Now the data is sent
to the server in real time,

00:06:11.733 --> 00:06:13.381
and a heat map is plotted,

00:06:13.405 --> 00:06:16.748
taking into account
all the active devices on the ground.

00:06:16.772 --> 00:06:21.057
The authorities could be alerted
if the crowd movement slowed down

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:24.216
or if the crowd density
moved beyond a desired threshold.

00:06:24.992 --> 00:06:29.984
We installed five of these mats
in the Nashik Kumbh Mela 2015,

00:06:30.008 --> 00:06:32.398
and counted over half a million people

00:06:32.422 --> 00:06:34.104
in 18 hours,

00:06:34.128 --> 00:06:38.505
ensuring that the data was available
in real time at various checkpoints,

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:40.405
ensuring a safe flow of people.

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:43.874
Now, this system, eventually,
with other innovations,

00:06:43.898 --> 00:06:47.050
is what helped prevent stampedes
altogether at that festival.

00:06:47.585 --> 00:06:50.458
The code used by Ashioto during Kumbh Mela

00:06:50.482 --> 00:06:53.894
will soon be made publicly available,
free to use for anyone.

00:06:53.918 --> 00:06:55.895
I would be glad if someone used this code

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:58.131
to make many more gatherings safer.

00:06:58.878 --> 00:07:00.804
Having succeeded at Kumbh Mela

00:07:00.828 --> 00:07:04.740
has inspired me to help others
who may also suffer from stampedes.

00:07:04.764 --> 00:07:07.573
The design of the system
makes it adaptable

00:07:07.597 --> 00:07:09.591
to pretty much any event

00:07:09.615 --> 00:07:13.411
that involves an organized
gathering of people.

00:07:13.435 --> 00:07:17.745
And my new dream is to improve,
adapt and deploy the system

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:23.238
all over the world to prevent loss of life
and ensure a safe flow of people,

00:07:23.262 --> 00:07:26.049
because every human soul is precious,

00:07:26.073 --> 00:07:28.451
whether at concerts or sporting events,

00:07:28.475 --> 00:07:30.362
the Maha Kumbh Mela in Allahabad,

00:07:30.386 --> 00:07:31.837
the Hajj in Mecca,

00:07:31.861 --> 00:07:33.758
the Shia procession to Karbala

00:07:33.782 --> 00:07:35.266
or at the Vatican City.

00:07:35.893 --> 00:07:37.770
So what do you all think, can we do it?

00:07:37.794 --> 00:07:38.945
(Audience) Yes!

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:40.120
Thank you.

00:07:40.144 --> 00:07:41.145
(Cheers)

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:44.439
(Applause)
