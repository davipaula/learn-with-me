00:00:13.192 --> 00:00:14.769
"It gets easier, right?"

00:00:15.307 --> 00:00:18.270
These are the words
I often hear from young parents

00:00:18.294 --> 00:00:20.981
who are new to the game
of worrying about their children.

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:22.954
I tell them that it doesn't.

00:00:23.582 --> 00:00:25.152
It gets different,

00:00:25.176 --> 00:00:28.285
but there's always something
to worry about as parents.

00:00:29.275 --> 00:00:32.089
I remember how I would lie
half-awake at night

00:00:32.113 --> 00:00:33.868
listening to my son breathe

00:00:33.892 --> 00:00:36.474
when he was young and had asthma,

00:00:36.498 --> 00:00:37.895
and then, when he was a teen,

00:00:37.919 --> 00:00:40.071
until I heard the front door chime open,

00:00:40.095 --> 00:00:41.896
and I knew that he was home safe.

00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:45.454
Worrying about our kids
comes with the territory.

00:00:46.318 --> 00:00:49.662
Now, many of these worries
are about basic issues,

00:00:49.686 --> 00:00:53.469
like what they eat,
where they are, who they're with.

00:00:53.493 --> 00:00:57.345
But we also need to keep an eye on
new behaviors and fads.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.748
The latest craze is something
that may not yet be on everyone's radar

00:01:02.772 --> 00:01:04.859
as a serious health concern,

00:01:04.883 --> 00:01:08.002
and that is the newfound
popularity of vaping,

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:10.127
or inhaling sweet aerosols

00:01:10.151 --> 00:01:13.519
produced by vaporizing
e-liquids in e-cigarettes.

00:01:14.835 --> 00:01:17.634
E-cigarettes, or "vapes,"
as they are commonly called,

00:01:17.658 --> 00:01:19.866
are flying off the shelves like candy.

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:23.082
This year, the e-cigarette
market is expected to drive

00:01:23.106 --> 00:01:26.276
26 billion dollars in sales worldwide.

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:28.232
Over the next six years,

00:01:28.256 --> 00:01:30.255
that volume is expected to double.

00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:35.067
We have a lot of serious concerns
about the health impact of vaping,

00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:37.914
and unfortunately,
not nearly enough answers.

00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:42.836
This becomes even more concerning
when you think of who uses e-cigarettes.

00:01:43.558 --> 00:01:46.007
E-cigarette use, at least in the US,

00:01:46.031 --> 00:01:49.703
has grown rapidly among youth
and young adults --

00:01:49.727 --> 00:01:50.943
our kids,

00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:52.883
our most vulnerable population.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.376
There was a 900 percent growth
in the use of e-cigarettes by youth

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.565
between 2012 and 2015.

00:02:01.415 --> 00:02:03.546
The most recent estimates suggest

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.063
that approximately 3.6 million
high school and middle school students

00:02:08.087 --> 00:02:10.318
have used e-cigarettes in the US.

00:02:11.635 --> 00:02:14.486
Now, e-cigarettes were originally created

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.728
to offer smokers a cleaner
form of nicotine

00:02:16.752 --> 00:02:18.669
to help with their cigarette addiction.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.421
In the US, these devices
come under the FDA's jurisdiction

00:02:23.445 --> 00:02:25.163
as a tobacco product.

00:02:25.187 --> 00:02:28.570
But the science on these devices
has not been able to keep up

00:02:28.594 --> 00:02:30.948
with the rapid market growth,

00:02:30.972 --> 00:02:35.373
so regulations on the components
of these devices and e-liquids

00:02:35.397 --> 00:02:36.606
are lagging.

00:02:37.586 --> 00:02:40.927
Current regulations do restrict
sales of these devices

00:02:40.951 --> 00:02:43.645
to anyone under the age of 18,

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:46.553
but these do not seem
to have had much of an impact

00:02:46.577 --> 00:02:49.816
on the explosion in the use
of these devices by teens.

00:02:51.052 --> 00:02:54.174
You know, the first time
I heard of and saw an e-cigarette,

00:02:54.198 --> 00:02:56.763
I knew right away
that teens would love it.

00:02:57.335 --> 00:03:00.154
These devices are technology on a stick,

00:03:00.178 --> 00:03:03.245
a perfect fit for
the smartphone generation --

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.391
small, rechargeable, easy to use,
easy to modify, nice smelling --

00:03:09.415 --> 00:03:13.190
some even sync with your smartphone
to let you know how much you have vaped.

00:03:13.214 --> 00:03:16.458
Even I was very drawn
to these very clever devices.

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:21.978
And since I had spent a long time
researching teen and adult addictions,

00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:27.389
I immediately realized that these devices
fit perfectly into the teen psyche.

00:03:28.622 --> 00:03:32.208
Teens are impulsive,
and they love to try new things.

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:36.434
They're also craving independence,
and they love to make things their own.

00:03:37.086 --> 00:03:39.666
E-cigarettes meet these needs perfectly

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.490
by allowing them the chance
to both innovate and personalize

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:44.950
their vape experience.

00:03:45.624 --> 00:03:50.522
They can choose from over 15,000
different e-liquid flavors

00:03:50.546 --> 00:03:52.799
and multiple nicotine concentrations.

00:03:52.823 --> 00:03:57.384
They can even create their own
nicotine flavor combination.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.856
They can change how much vapor
is produced from these devices

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.843
by modifying the puff volume
and the constituents

00:04:04.867 --> 00:04:07.140
and the power and temperature
of the devices.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.284
They can even use these devices
for "cloud chasing."

00:04:12.317 --> 00:04:15.145
Cloud chasing, also called vape tricks

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:16.455
or smoke tricks,

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.599
involves producing large vape clouds
with quirky shapes and names,

00:04:20.623 --> 00:04:23.438
like rings, dragons, ghosts ...

00:04:23.462 --> 00:04:26.804
Cloud chasers can even participate
in cloud competitions

00:04:26.828 --> 00:04:30.451
and win prizes for creating
the most innovative shaped clouds.

00:04:31.884 --> 00:04:35.665
Teens can also change the strength
and throat hit from the vapor

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:39.150
by either vaporizing the e-liquid
at higher temperatures

00:04:39.174 --> 00:04:42.216
or dripping the e-liquid
directly onto a heated coil.

00:04:43.423 --> 00:04:46.282
They can even use these devices
for marijuana vaping.

00:04:46.941 --> 00:04:49.308
And since the devices
use lower temperatures

00:04:49.332 --> 00:04:52.353
and do not combust or burn the marijuana,

00:04:52.377 --> 00:04:54.182
they can do this very discreetly,

00:04:54.206 --> 00:04:56.797
without the distinctive smell
of burnt marijuana.

00:04:57.577 --> 00:05:00.804
So they can really make these vape
experiences their own,

00:05:00.828 --> 00:05:05.013
which may explain the astounding rise
in the use of these devices by youth.

00:05:06.723 --> 00:05:09.710
E-cigarettes are technically
a very simple device.

00:05:10.388 --> 00:05:16.266
There is a receptacle for the e-liquid
which can be a tank, a pod or a plug.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.823
There is a battery that charges the coil,
which then vaporizes the e-liquid.

00:05:20.847 --> 00:05:22.341
And then there is a mouthpiece,

00:05:22.365 --> 00:05:24.936
where the user can actually draw
from the e-cigarette.

00:05:25.624 --> 00:05:31.654
In 2017, there were 466 e-cigarette
devices in the marketplace.

00:05:32.594 --> 00:05:37.173
These range from cigarette-like devices
which are also called "cigalikes"

00:05:37.197 --> 00:05:40.868
to tank systems,
which are also called "pens."

00:05:40.892 --> 00:05:44.820
And then there are modified devices,
which are also called "mods."

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:47.300
Mods look nothing like a cigarette,

00:05:47.324 --> 00:05:50.462
and they come in various shapes and sizes,

00:05:50.486 --> 00:05:53.790
with different kinds of attachments
and user adjustments.

00:05:53.814 --> 00:05:55.904
They're very popular for cloud chasing.

00:05:56.772 --> 00:05:59.157
The most recent entrance
into the marketplace

00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:00.715
are the pod devices,

00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:03.126
which contain the e-liquid in a pod.

00:06:03.713 --> 00:06:06.015
These are very popular,
by the way, among teens.

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:08.389
An example of this is the Juul,

00:06:08.413 --> 00:06:11.016
which not only looks like a USB device

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.362
but can also be plugged
into a USB outlet to charge.

00:06:15.142 --> 00:06:17.809
Many teens do not even think
that these are e-cigarettes,

00:06:17.833 --> 00:06:22.042
which has led to the use of terms
like "juuling" instead of "vaping."

00:06:22.897 --> 00:06:26.985
Many of these devices are so discreet
and produce so little vapor

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:29.171
that teens are using them in classrooms

00:06:29.195 --> 00:06:32.874
and hiding them in objects
like Sharpie pens, their clothes,

00:06:32.898 --> 00:06:34.048
their books.

00:06:34.452 --> 00:06:37.473
Now, many teens think
that these devices produce water vapor,

00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:39.303
and therefore, they are safe to use.

00:06:39.327 --> 00:06:41.698
But this could not be
further from the truth.

00:06:42.285 --> 00:06:44.479
What is produced is not even a vapor,

00:06:44.503 --> 00:06:45.746
it's an aerosol,

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.525
and let me tell you, the difference
is quite pronounced.

00:06:49.237 --> 00:06:53.995
Aerosols contain many finely suspended
particles of liquids and gases

00:06:54.019 --> 00:06:56.650
that are created
from whatever is in the e-liquid.

00:06:57.338 --> 00:07:00.670
So an aerosol could contain
propylene glycol and glycerin,

00:07:00.694 --> 00:07:02.382
which are solvents in the e-liquid.

00:07:02.883 --> 00:07:05.990
Now, these solvents are known
to be safe for edible use,

00:07:06.014 --> 00:07:08.828
so for use in products that you eat,

00:07:08.852 --> 00:07:13.678
but we know very little about their safety
following long-term inhalational exposure.

00:07:14.918 --> 00:07:16.922
The e-liquids can also contain alcohol,

00:07:16.946 --> 00:07:18.689
sometimes in high levels,

00:07:18.713 --> 00:07:22.552
and inhaling alcohol is known
to have toxic effects on the brain.

00:07:23.957 --> 00:07:28.178
I told you earlier that the e-liquids
contain over 15,000 different flavors.

00:07:28.202 --> 00:07:29.614
Here are some examples,

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:35.115
some with very catchy but familiar names
like "Skittles" and "Fruit Loops,"

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:39.585
and others with more exotic names
like "Dragon's Milk" and "Tiger's Blood"

00:07:39.609 --> 00:07:41.107
and "Unicorn Puke."

00:07:41.522 --> 00:07:46.010
The e-liquid or the aerosol
can also contain metallic particles

00:07:46.034 --> 00:07:48.085
like chromium, cadmium and lead.

00:07:48.521 --> 00:07:51.887
These are generated
from the heating coil in the devices

00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:55.445
and are also known to have
many toxic effects on vital organs.

00:07:55.973 --> 00:07:58.589
So no, let me make this very clear:

00:07:58.613 --> 00:08:01.666
what is produced is definitely
not water vapor.

00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:07.427
Exposure of the teen brain to nicotine
through e-cigarettes

00:08:07.451 --> 00:08:08.889
is also very concerning.

00:08:09.833 --> 00:08:12.971
The teen brain is very sensitive
to even low levels of nicotine

00:08:12.995 --> 00:08:14.698
and gets very easily addicted.

00:08:15.174 --> 00:08:17.891
In fact, we have known for a long time

00:08:17.915 --> 00:08:22.637
that 90 percent of smokers start smoking
cigarettes prior to the age of 18.

00:08:23.256 --> 00:08:27.547
Those who start early are more addicted
and have a harder time quitting smoking.

00:08:28.269 --> 00:08:32.274
In other words, and to quote
a past FDA commissioner,

00:08:32.298 --> 00:08:35.166
"Nicotine addiction ...
is a pediatric disease."

00:08:36.435 --> 00:08:39.531
E-cigarettes can expose teens
to a lot of nicotine.

00:08:40.043 --> 00:08:42.514
Many of these devices contain
the amount of nicotine

00:08:42.538 --> 00:08:44.383
that is in a full pack of cigarettes.

00:08:45.165 --> 00:08:48.894
The more recent pod devices
contain a nicotine salt,

00:08:48.918 --> 00:08:51.873
which has a smoother taste
and is much easier to use

00:08:51.897 --> 00:08:55.174
and can produce rapid increases
in brain nicotine levels.

00:08:56.487 --> 00:09:00.294
Teens who use e-cigarettes regularly
report symptoms of craving --

00:09:00.318 --> 00:09:03.120
feeling anxious when they don't
have their e-cigarettes.

00:09:03.144 --> 00:09:05.829
All these are hallmarks
of a behavioral addiction.

00:09:07.087 --> 00:09:11.935
E-cigarettes are not only addictive

00:09:11.959 --> 00:09:14.927
but they also affect
many other organs in the body.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.832
So nicotine, which is
in e-cigarettes, for example,

00:09:17.856 --> 00:09:21.909
binds to a receptor called
the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor,

00:09:21.933 --> 00:09:25.756
which plays a key role in the functioning
of almost all organ systems

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.063
in the human body.

00:09:27.415 --> 00:09:31.547
And chronic exposure to nicotine
changes the functioning of these systems.

00:09:32.016 --> 00:09:33.764
So as an example,

00:09:33.788 --> 00:09:37.653
chronic exposure to nicotine decreases
the flexibility of the blood vessels

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:41.983
and changes how the heart responds
to acute challenges like stress.

00:09:43.221 --> 00:09:46.938
The teen brain is not only sensitive
to the addictive effects of nicotine

00:09:46.962 --> 00:09:49.105
but also to its toxic effects.

00:09:49.605 --> 00:09:54.207
In adolescent animals, nicotine
is a very well-established neurotoxin,

00:09:54.231 --> 00:09:57.471
and it decreases learning,
memory and attention processes

00:09:57.495 --> 00:09:59.927
and increases hyperactivity symptoms.

00:09:59.951 --> 00:10:02.852
Teens who use tobacco products
are more likely to use

00:10:02.876 --> 00:10:04.396
marijuana and alcohol

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:09.179
and also develop depression and anxiety
as a teen or as an adult.

00:10:10.648 --> 00:10:14.912
So nicotine addiction through e-cigarettes
could be leading them down the path

00:10:14.936 --> 00:10:18.416
of other addictions
and other mental health problems.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:23.611
Now, in adolescent animals, nicotine
also produces epigenetic changes,

00:10:23.635 --> 00:10:26.043
or heritable changes in gene expression,

00:10:26.067 --> 00:10:28.667
for example, in the genes
involved in asthma.

00:10:29.385 --> 00:10:33.011
So teens who use nicotine may not only
be harming themselves

00:10:33.035 --> 00:10:35.800
but they could be harming
their future generations.

00:10:37.141 --> 00:10:39.747
You know, the very existence
of e-cigarettes

00:10:39.771 --> 00:10:43.721
could have led to an entire generation
of nicotine-addicted youth.

00:10:44.861 --> 00:10:48.255
Easy access to these devices
could have led to more experimentation

00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:52.133
with marijuana and many other
vaporizable substances by youth.

00:10:53.308 --> 00:10:57.917
While there is no doubt that providing
smokers with a cleaner form of nicotine

00:10:57.941 --> 00:11:01.341
is and should continue
to be a critical goal,

00:11:01.365 --> 00:11:05.226
we still do not know if these devices
help smokers quit smoking,

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.959
and we know very little about
the long-term effects of these devices.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:15.132
What we do know is that youth --
lots of youth -- are using these devices.

00:11:15.489 --> 00:11:19.493
In fact, the FDA commissioner
recently used the term "epidemic"

00:11:19.517 --> 00:11:21.934
to describe e-cigarette use in the US.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.527
While trying to solve one huge
public health problem, cigarette smoking,

00:11:27.551 --> 00:11:29.720
we may have created another colossal one.

00:11:30.759 --> 00:11:34.359
Our lack of vigilance in the earlier years
around cigarette smoking

00:11:34.383 --> 00:11:38.331
led to a cigarette epidemic and many,
many cigarette-related diseases.

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:41.980
We do not want to repeat
the same mistakes with e-cigarettes.

00:11:43.092 --> 00:11:46.452
So now is the time for action,

00:11:46.476 --> 00:11:51.202
for regulations that address the appeal
and access of these devices to youth.

00:11:52.405 --> 00:11:57.886
Do smokers really need 15,000
kid-friendly flavors to quit smoking?

00:11:58.736 --> 00:12:01.670
Do they need so many different
kinds of devices?

00:12:02.458 --> 00:12:06.249
Is it a good idea to have devices
which are so easy to hide

00:12:06.273 --> 00:12:07.973
and so easy to use?

00:12:09.292 --> 00:12:13.902
We recently heard that the FDA plans
to introduce stricter regulations

00:12:13.926 --> 00:12:17.851
on sales of these devices
that contain e-liquid flavors

00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:21.420
in retail locations like convenience
stores and gas stations,

00:12:21.444 --> 00:12:23.370
and also introduce stricter regulations

00:12:23.394 --> 00:12:26.085
on sales of devices
to minors over the internet.

00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:31.416
Is this going to be sufficient to change
this rapid increase in youth uptake?

00:12:32.411 --> 00:12:35.343
We need to ask and answer
such critical questions.

00:12:36.684 --> 00:12:40.398
Now is also the time for a serious
public education campaign.

00:12:40.946 --> 00:12:43.263
Teens and their parents need to know

00:12:43.287 --> 00:12:46.976
that while e-cigarettes may contain
less toxins than cigarettes,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.763
they're certainly not benign.

00:12:49.773 --> 00:12:53.384
Exposure of their bodies to the chemicals
produced by these devices

00:12:53.408 --> 00:12:56.152
could be changing them in ways
they may not like

00:12:56.176 --> 00:12:59.823
and setting them up for future
unknown toxicities and health problems.

00:13:01.526 --> 00:13:02.922
You know, when I said earlier

00:13:02.946 --> 00:13:06.126
that e-cigarettes were a perfect fit
for the smartphone generation,

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.300
I was not kidding.

00:13:07.911 --> 00:13:10.802
We live in a technology-crazed world,

00:13:10.826 --> 00:13:14.950
where the latest device
and technology gets a lot of attention

00:13:14.974 --> 00:13:18.531
just because it is technology
and because it is the latest thing.

00:13:19.414 --> 00:13:23.064
More and more over the next few years
and for the rest of our lives,

00:13:23.088 --> 00:13:26.122
we are going to see technologies
coming into the marketplace

00:13:26.146 --> 00:13:28.722
that may not raise
any health flags at first,

00:13:28.746 --> 00:13:31.306
simply because they don't look unhealthy

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.275
or they're not a medical device.

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:35.909
For example, we could see devices

00:13:35.933 --> 00:13:39.308
that may make it easier
to go longer without sleep

00:13:39.332 --> 00:13:40.619
or help us lose weight --

00:13:40.643 --> 00:13:42.194
a personal goal of mine --

00:13:42.218 --> 00:13:44.484
or achieve any number of other goals

00:13:44.508 --> 00:13:47.694
that we as consumers
are very, very interested in.

00:13:48.832 --> 00:13:54.039
But many of these devices may come
with unacceptable risks to our own health.

00:13:54.904 --> 00:13:58.779
So if we want to protect our health
and the health of our children,

00:13:58.803 --> 00:14:00.949
perhaps we should get out of the habit

00:14:00.973 --> 00:14:04.516
of automatically celebrating
such new technology

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:08.740
and get into the habit of looking
at them with a critical eye,

00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:10.594
perhaps even through a medical lens.

00:14:11.331 --> 00:14:13.013
Because, you know something?

00:14:13.037 --> 00:14:17.438
Our health, the health of our children
and our future generations

00:14:17.462 --> 00:14:21.474
is far too valuable
to let it go up in smoke --

00:14:21.498 --> 00:14:23.029
or even in aerosol.

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:24.513
Thank you.

00:14:24.537 --> 00:14:27.167
(Applause)
