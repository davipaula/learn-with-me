00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:09.349
Think about all the things that need to happen

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:11.776
for a human settlement to thrive:

00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:13.174
obtaining food,

00:00:13.174 --> 00:00:14.344
building shelter,

00:00:14.344 --> 00:00:16.676
raising children and more.

00:00:16.676 --> 00:00:18.815
There needs to be a way to divide resources,

00:00:18.815 --> 00:00:20.542
organize major efforts

00:00:20.542 --> 00:00:23.111
and distribute labor efficiently.

00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:26.240
Now imagine having to do this without any sort of planning

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.455
or higher level communication.

00:00:28.455 --> 00:00:30.267
Welcome to the ant colony.

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:33.564
Ants have some of the most complex social organization

00:00:33.564 --> 00:00:35.319
in the animal kingdom,

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:36.639
living in structured colonies

00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:38.697
containing different types of members

00:00:38.697 --> 00:00:40.934
who perform specific roles.

00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:44.126
But although this may sound similar to some human societies,

00:00:44.126 --> 00:00:47.966
this organization doesn't arise from any higher level decisions,

00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:51.712
but is part of a biologically programmed cycle.

00:00:51.712 --> 00:00:53.305
In many species,

00:00:53.305 --> 00:00:56.215
all the winged males and winged virgin queens

00:00:56.215 --> 00:00:58.950
from all the nearby colonies in the population

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.253
each leave from their different nests

00:01:01.253 --> 00:01:03.932
and meet at a central place to mate,

00:01:03.932 --> 00:01:07.655
using pheromones to guide each other to a breeding ground.

00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:10.177
After mating, the males die off,

00:01:10.177 --> 00:01:13.236
while females try to establish a new colony.

00:01:13.236 --> 00:01:16.349
The few that are successful settle down in a suitable spot,

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:17.739
lose their wings,

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:19.659
and begin laying eggs,

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.251
selectively fertilizing some using stored sperm they've saved up from mating.

00:01:25.253 --> 00:01:27.980
Fertilized eggs grow into female workers

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.455
who care for the queen and her eggs.

00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:31.951
They will then defend the colony

00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:33.652
and forage for food,

00:01:33.652 --> 00:01:36.524
while unfertilized eggs grow into males

00:01:36.524 --> 00:01:40.055
whose only job is to wait until they are ready to leave the nest

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:42.852
and reproduce, beginning the cycle again.

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:46.241
So how do worker ants decide what to do and when?

00:01:46.241 --> 00:01:48.054
Well, they don't really.

00:01:48.054 --> 00:01:50.813
Although they have no methods of intentional communication,

00:01:50.813 --> 00:01:53.600
individual ants do interact with one another

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.850
through touch, sound and chemical signals.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.241
These stimuli accomplish many things

00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:02.674
from serving as an alarm to other ants if one is killed,

00:02:02.674 --> 00:02:06.778
to signaling when a queen is nearing the end of her reproductive life.

00:02:06.778 --> 00:02:10.673
But one of the most impressive collective capabilities of an ant colony

00:02:10.673 --> 00:02:14.231
is to thoroughly and efficiently explore large areas

00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:16.917
without any predetermined plan.

00:02:16.917 --> 00:02:19.815
Most species of ants have little or no sense of sight

00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:22.613
and can only smell things in their vicinity.

00:02:22.613 --> 00:02:24.852
Combined with their lack of high level coordination,

00:02:24.852 --> 00:02:28.024
this would seem to make them terrible explorers,

00:02:28.024 --> 00:02:29.927
but there is an amazingly simple way

00:02:29.927 --> 00:02:32.680
that ants maximize their searching efficiency;

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.358
by changing their movement patterns

00:02:34.358 --> 00:02:37.099
based on individual interactions.

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.567
When two ants meet,

00:02:38.567 --> 00:02:40.913
they sense each other by touching antennae.

00:02:40.913 --> 00:02:44.652
If there are many ants in a small area this will happen more often

00:02:44.652 --> 00:02:46.698
causing them to respond by moving

00:02:46.698 --> 00:02:51.761
in more convoluted, random paths in order to search more thoroughly.

00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:55.757
But in a larger area, with less ants, where such meetings happen less often,

00:02:55.757 --> 00:02:59.007
they can walk in straight lines to cover more ground.

00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:01.330
While exploring their environment in this way,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:03.879
an ant may come across any number of things,

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.835
from threats or enemies, to alternate nesting sites.

00:03:06.835 --> 00:03:11.707
And some species have another capability known as recruitment.

00:03:11.707 --> 00:03:14.216
When one of these ants happens to find food,

00:03:14.216 --> 00:03:18.266
it will return with it, marking its path with a chemical scent.

00:03:18.266 --> 00:03:20.863
Other ants will then follow this pheromone trail,

00:03:20.863 --> 00:03:24.516
renewing it each time they manage to find food and return.

00:03:24.516 --> 00:03:26.998
Once the food in that spot is depleted,

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:29.382
the ants stop marking their return.

00:03:29.382 --> 00:03:33.875
The scent dissipates and ants are no longer attracted to that path.

00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:36.772
These seemingly crude methods of search and retrieval

00:03:36.772 --> 00:03:40.654
are, in fact, so useful that they are applied in computer models

00:03:40.654 --> 00:03:44.813
to obtain optimal solutions from decentralized elements,

00:03:44.813 --> 00:03:48.079
working randomly and exchanging simple information.

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.134
This has many theoretical and practical applications,

00:03:51.134 --> 00:03:53.967
from solving the famous traveling salesman problem,

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:58.177
to scheduling computing tasks and optimizing Internet searches,

00:03:58.177 --> 00:04:01.072
to enabling groups of robots to search a minefield

00:04:01.072 --> 00:04:04.807
or a burning building collectively, without any central control.

00:04:04.807 --> 00:04:09.160
But you can observe these fascinatingly simple, yet effective, processes directly

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.994
through some simple experiments,

00:04:10.994 --> 00:04:14.717
by allowing ants to enter empty spaces of various sizes

00:04:14.717 --> 00:04:17.135
and paying attention to their behavior.

00:04:17.135 --> 00:04:21.026
Ants may not be able to vote, hold meetings or even make any plans,

00:04:21.026 --> 00:04:23.830
but we humans may still be able to learn something

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.938
from the way that such simple creatures

00:04:25.938 --> 00:04:30.468
are able to function so effectively in such complex ways.
