00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.816
If you ask evolutionary biologists

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.136
when did humans become humans,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.256
some of them will say that,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.176
well, at some point
we started standing on our feet,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.520
became biped and became
the masters of our environment.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.176
Others will say that because our brain
started growing much bigger,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.280
that we were able to have
much more complex cognitive processes.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.056
And others might argue
that it's because we developed language

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.360
that allowed us to evolve as a species.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.496
Interestingly, those three
phenomena are all connected.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.296
We are not sure how or in which order,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.856
but they are all linked

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.640
with the change of shape of a little bone
in the back of your neck

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.000
that changed the angle
between our head and our body.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.816
That means we were able to stand upright

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.976
but also for our brain
to evolve in the back

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.616
and for our voice box to grow
from seven centimeters for primates

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.760
to 11 and up to 17 centimetres for humans.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.480
And this is called
the descent of the larynx.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.240
And the larynx is the site of your voice.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.320
When baby humans are born today,
their larynx is not descended yet.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.480
That only happens
at about three months old.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.296
So, metaphorically, each of us here

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.560
has relived the evolution
of our whole species.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.136
And talking about babies,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.800
when you were starting to develop
in your mother's womb,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.816
the first sensation that you had
coming from the outside world,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.776
at only three weeks old,
when you were about the size of a shrimp,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.496
were through the tactile sensation

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.320
coming from the vibrations
of your mother's voice.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.416
So, as we can see, the human voice
is quite meaningful and important

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.416
at the level of the species,

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.976
at the level of the society --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.936
this is how we communicate
and create bonds,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.416
and at the personal
and interpersonal levels --

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.576
with our voice, we share much more
than words and data,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.736
we share basically who we are.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.136
And our voice is indistinguishable
from how other people see us.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.080
It is a mask that we wear in society.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.810
But our relationship with our own voice
is far from obvious.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.616
We rarely use our voice for ourselves;
we use it as a gift to give to others.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.816
It is how we touch each other.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.776
It's a dialectical grooming.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.216
But what do we think about our own voice?

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.976
So please raise your hand

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.016
if you don't like the sound of your voice
when you hear it on a recording machine.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.256
(Laughter)

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.496
Yeah, thank you, indeed,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.416
most people report not liking
the sound of their voice recording.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.656
So what does that mean?

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.376
Let's try to understand that
in the next 10 minutes.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.496
I'm a researcher at the MIT Media Lab,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.360
part of the Opera of the Future group,

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.256
and my research
focuses on the relationship

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.360
people have with their own voice
and with the voices of others.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.816
I study what we can learn
from listening to voices,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.216
from the various fields,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.120
from neurology to biology,
cognitive sciences, linguistics.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.736
In our group we create
tools and experiences

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.496
to help people gain a better
applied understanding of their voice

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.576
in order to reduce the biases,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.696
to become better listeners,

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.696
to create more healthy relationships

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.720
or just to understand themselves better.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.520
And this really has to come
with a holistic approach on the voice.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.256
Because, think about all
the applications and implications

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.160
that the voice may have,
as we discover more about it.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.296
Your voice is a very complex phenomenon.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.640
It requires a synchronization
of more than 100 muscles in your body.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.856
And by listening to the voice,

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.656
we can understand possible failures
of what happens inside.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.880
For example:

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.336
listening to very specific
types of turbulences

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.656
and nonlinearity of the voice

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.136
can help predict
very early stages of Parkinson's,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.560
just through a phone call.

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:34.140
Listening to the breathlessness
of the voice

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.950
can help detect heart disease.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.496
And we also know that the changes of tempo
inside individual words

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.800
is a very good marker of depression.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.376
Your voice is also very linked
with your hormone levels.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.016
Third parties listening to female voices

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.056
were able to very accurately
place the speaker

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.400
on their menstrual cycle.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.080
Just with acoustic information.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.376
And now with technology
listening to us all the time,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.376
Alexa from Amazon Echo

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.816
might be able to predict
if you're pregnant

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.536
even before you know it.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.896
So think about --

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.096
(Laughter)

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.280
Think about the ethical
implications of that.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.816
Your voice is also very linked
to how you create relationships.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.216
You have a different voice
for every person you talk to.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.736
If I take a little snippet
of your voice and I analyze it,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.136
I can know whether you're talking
to your mother, to your brother,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.776
your friend or your boss.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.976
We can also use, as a predictor,
the vocal posture.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.936
Meaning, how you decide to place
your voice when you talk to someone.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.176
And you vocal posture,
when you talk to your spouse,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.880
can help predict not only if,
but also when you will divorce.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.000
So there is a lot to learn
from listening to voices.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.456
And I believe this has to start
with understanding

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.496
that we have more than one voice.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.376
So, I'm going to talk
about three voices that most of us posses,

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.720
in a model of what I call the mask.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.496
So when you look at the mask,

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.800
what you see is a projection
of a character.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.496
Let's call that your outward voice.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.336
This is also the most classic way
to think about the voice,

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.256
it's a way of projecting
yourself in the world.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.536
The mechanism for this projection
is well understood.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.896
Your lungs contract your diaphragm

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.176
and that creates a self-sustained
vibration of your vocal fold,

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.696
that creates a sound.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.896
And then the way you open and close
the cavities in you mouth,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.616
your vocal tract is going to
transform the sound.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.856
So everyone has the same mechanism.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.656
But voices are quite unique.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.456
It's because very subtle differences
in size, physiology, in hormone levels

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.120
are going to make very subtle
differences in your outward voice.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.856
And your brain is very good

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.680
at picking up those subtle differences
from other people's outward voices.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.016
In our lab, we are working
on teaching machines

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.456
to understand those subtle differences.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:07.336
And we use deep learning to create
a real-time speaker identification system

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.136
to help raise awareness
on the use of the shared vocal space --

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.560
so who talks and who never
talks during meetings --

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.280
to increase group intelligence.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.080
And one of the difficulties with that
is that your voice is also not static.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.136
We already said that it changes
with every person you talk to

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.096
but it also changes generally
throughout your life.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.336
At the beginning
and at the end of the journey,

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:34.056
male and female voices are very similar.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.616
It's very hard to distinguish

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.760
the voice of a very young girl
from the voice of a very young boy.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:45.376
But in between, your voice
becomes a marker of your fluid identity.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.336
Generally, for male voices
there's a big change at puberty.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.696
And then for female voices,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.960
there is a change at each pregnancy
and a big change at menopause.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.456
So all of that is the voice
other people hear when you talk.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.680
So why is it that we're so
unfamiliar with it?

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.016
Why is it that it's not
the voice that we hear?

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.256
So, let's think about it.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.800
When you wear a mask,
you actually don't see the mask.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.560
And when you try to observe it,
what you will see is inside of the mask.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.920
And that's your inward voice.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.576
So to understand why it's different,

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.280
let's try to understand the mechanism
of perception of this inward voice.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.496
Because your body has many ways
of filtering it differently

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.536
from the outward voice.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.056
So to perceive this voice,
it first has to travel to your ears.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.656
And your outward voice
travels through the air

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.176
while your inward voice
travels through your bones.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.800
This is called bone conduction.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:49.655
Because of this, your inward voice
is going to sound in a lower register

00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:54.400
and also more musically harmonical
than your outward voice.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.296
Once it travels there,
it has to access your inner ear.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.736
And there's this other mechanism
taking place here.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.856
It's a mechanical filter,

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.416
it's a little partition
that comes and protects your inner ear

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.176
each time you produce a sound.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.400
So it also reduces what you hear.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.200
And then there is a third filter,
it's a biological filter.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.136
Your cochlea -- it's a part of your
inner ear that processes the sound --

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.216
is made out of living cells.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.336
And those living cells
are going to trigger differently

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.936
according to how often
they hear the sound.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.360
It's a habituation effect.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.936
So because of this,

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.016
as your voice is the sound
you hear the most in your life,

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.520
you actually hear it less
than other sounds.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.296
Finally, we have a fourth filter.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.840
It's a neurological filter.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.216
Neurologists found out recently

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.016
that when you open your mouth
to create a sound,

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.840
your own auditory cortex shuts down.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.296
So you hear your voice

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:01.600
but your brain actually never listens
to the sound of your voice.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.576
Well, evolutionarily
that might make sense,

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.576
because we know cognitively
what we are going to sound like

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.760
so maybe we don't need
to spend energy analyzing the signal.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.216
And this is called a corollary discharge

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.736
and it happens for every motion
that your body does.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.976
The exact definition
of a corollary discharge

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.256
is a copy of a motor command
that is sent by the brain.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.976
This copy doesn't create any motion itself

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.976
but instead is sent
to other regions of the brain

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.160
to inform them of the impending motion.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.600
And for the voice, this corollary
discharge also has a different name.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.576
It is your inner voice.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.416
So let's recapitulate.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.496
We have the mask, the outward voice,

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.616
the inside of the mask, your inward voice,

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.656
and then you have your inner voice.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.736
And I like to see this one
as the puppeteer

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.200
that holds the strings
of the whole system.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.056
Your inner voice is

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.920
the one you hear
when you read a text silently,

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.560
when you rehearse
for an important conversation.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.376
Sometimes is hard to turn it off,

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.456
it's really hard to look at the text
written in your native language,

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.560
without having this inner voice read it.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.136
It's also the voice
that refuse to stop singing

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.976
the stupid song you have in your head.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.200
(Laughter)

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.976
And for some people
it's actually impossible to control it.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.736
And that's the case
of schizophrenic patients,

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.776
who have auditory hallucinations.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.136
Who can't distinguish at all
between voices coming from inside

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.656
and outside their head.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.056
So in our lab, we are also
working on small devices

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.616
to help those people
make those distinctions

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.280
and know if a voice
is internal or external.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:53.096
You can also think about the inner voice
as the voice that speaks in your dream.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.216
This inner voice can take many forms.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.456
And in your dreams, you actually unleash
the potential of this inner voice.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.536
That's another work
we are doing in our lab:

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.720
trying to access
this inner voice in dreams.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:08.576
So even if you can't always control it,

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.136
the inner voice --
you can always engage with it

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.496
through dialogue, through inner dialogues.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.336
And you can even see this inner voice

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.000
as the missing link
between thought and actions.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.776
So I hope I've left you
with a better appreciation,

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.256
a new appreciation of all of your voices

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.816
and the role it plays
inside and outside of you --

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:34.256
as your voice is a very critical
determinant of what makes you humans

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.560
and of how you interact with the world.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.336
Thank you.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.200
(Applause)
