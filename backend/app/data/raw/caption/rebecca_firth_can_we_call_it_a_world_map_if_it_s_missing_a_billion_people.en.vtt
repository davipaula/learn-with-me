00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:16.374
When Hurricane Maria
hit Puerto Rico in 2017,

00:00:16.398 --> 00:00:19.471
we all watched as a disaster
played out on our screens.

00:00:19.495 --> 00:00:22.112
At least 160,000 people were displaced,

00:00:22.136 --> 00:00:24.211
and nearly 3,000 people died.

00:00:24.235 --> 00:00:26.707
Electricity was cut off
to the entire island,

00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:29.896
and some neighborhoods
didn't get power back for 11 months.

00:00:30.326 --> 00:00:32.838
Many of those watching
didn't know how to help.

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:35.879
Some donated to international NGOs.

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:38.072
Some lobbied their elected officials.

00:00:38.096 --> 00:00:39.664
But as with so many crises,

00:00:39.688 --> 00:00:42.449
so many of us simply gave in
and felt helpless.

00:00:42.838 --> 00:00:44.815
At the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team,

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:46.252
also known as HOT,

00:00:46.276 --> 00:00:47.728
we did something different.

00:00:47.752 --> 00:00:50.641
We mobilized 6,000 volunteers
across the world

00:00:50.665 --> 00:00:53.859
who mapped every home
and every road in Puerto Rico.

00:00:53.883 --> 00:00:57.396
And here you can see the maps
those volunteers made taking shape.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.040
Responders then used those maps
to assess the state of buildings and roads

00:01:01.064 --> 00:01:04.649
and to provide emergency funds,
WiFi and phone-charging points

00:01:04.673 --> 00:01:06.701
to people whose homes were damaged.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.393
All crises,

00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:11.501
including the COVID-19 pandemic
we're living through right now,

00:01:11.525 --> 00:01:13.447
have devastating characteristics.

00:01:14.038 --> 00:01:16.518
But many of them have one thing in common:

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:20.176
the people hit the hardest are often
literally not on the map.

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:24.755
Right now, more than one billion people
live in places that are not mapped.

00:01:25.246 --> 00:01:27.042
If you look those places up online,

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.943
you'll see nothing but a blank.

00:01:28.967 --> 00:01:32.256
And that blank isn't just
a huge statement of disrespect

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.239
to our fellow human beings,

00:01:34.263 --> 00:01:35.896
it's an injustice,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.424
causing very direct, very real
and very avoidable human suffering.

00:01:40.448 --> 00:01:44.007
So what does not being
on the digital map actually look like?

00:01:44.515 --> 00:01:46.488
I live in Peru, and a few months ago,

00:01:46.512 --> 00:01:49.210
some community health workers
asked us to help them map.

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:51.220
Obviously, where they were wasn't mapped,

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:54.012
so to get there, we asked
a local mayor to draw the route.

00:01:54.036 --> 00:01:55.351
This is what he drew.

00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:57.666
This piece of paper
was hard to follow. (Laughs)

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.761
We didn't really know
what these lines were.

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:02.899
He put some numbers on there
that he assured us were travel times,

00:02:02.923 --> 00:02:04.321
but as we were driving along,

00:02:04.345 --> 00:02:06.453
these did not correspond to our reality.

00:02:06.477 --> 00:02:08.986
But this isn't about me getting lost

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.252
or about shaming
someone's bad drawing skills.

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:13.794
Think how inefficient it is
to manage a team

00:02:13.818 --> 00:02:15.369
who need to work in this place

00:02:15.393 --> 00:02:17.801
without a map to tell them
where they need to go.

00:02:18.214 --> 00:02:20.166
Then, once they're in the right village,

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.161
how can they collect some data
and associate it to that place?

00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:26.598
Those community health workers
know that needs in this region are high,

00:02:26.622 --> 00:02:29.091
particularly anemia
and malnutrition among children.

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:31.290
They just don't know
where those children are,

00:02:31.314 --> 00:02:32.871
or what is causing that problem.

00:02:32.895 --> 00:02:36.033
They want to be able to locate
the home of every child under five,

00:02:36.057 --> 00:02:38.106
but how can they do that without a map?

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.733
After a brief training,
we went out to make a map,

00:02:40.757 --> 00:02:43.476
and this is what those community
health workers produced.

00:02:43.873 --> 00:02:45.985
This map has everything
you need to navigate,

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:47.408
like the rivers and bridges,

00:02:47.432 --> 00:02:51.253
but it also has every local landmark,
the school, the football pitch, the plaza.

00:02:51.277 --> 00:02:53.350
And I'm pleased to say
that a few weeks ago,

00:02:53.374 --> 00:02:55.732
we got a call from
those community health workers,

00:02:55.756 --> 00:02:58.863
and they're using this map
in their response containing COVID-19.

00:02:59.593 --> 00:03:00.953
So you might be thinking:

00:03:00.977 --> 00:03:03.247
Why aren't these places
on commercial maps?

00:03:03.866 --> 00:03:06.762
In short, mapping the most
vulnerable places in our world

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:09.384
just hasn't been a priority
for for-profit companies,

00:03:09.408 --> 00:03:13.255
whose business models typically rely
on advertising and data sales.

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:15.699
This leaves out the poorest communities

00:03:15.723 --> 00:03:18.350
and means that individual
aid organizations create maps

00:03:18.374 --> 00:03:20.447
for the small areas
that they're working in

00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:25.247
in offline systems which rapidly
become out-of-date when a project ends.

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:27.932
So what we have here
is a lack of easily shareable

00:03:27.956 --> 00:03:29.710
and easily updatable data.

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.738
But we also have a solution.

00:03:32.158 --> 00:03:34.224
We map with a tool
called OpenStreetMap,

00:03:34.248 --> 00:03:36.013
which was founded in 2006

00:03:36.037 --> 00:03:39.522
and is a free, open-source tool
which anyone can use to map the world.

00:03:39.998 --> 00:03:43.080
Just as anyone can read or edit
an article on Wikipedia,

00:03:43.104 --> 00:03:45.415
anyone can use or edit
the map in OpenStreetMap,

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.224
and the resulting map is public good,

00:03:47.248 --> 00:03:48.850
free and open for anyone to use,

00:03:48.874 --> 00:03:51.144
creating one map for all of us.

00:03:51.168 --> 00:03:53.006
It works in two phases.

00:03:53.847 --> 00:03:56.125
Buildings and roads might not
be on the map yet,

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:58.588
but you can see them clearly
in satellite imagery.

00:03:58.612 --> 00:04:02.321
Volunteers working anywhere in the world
turn satellite images into maps

00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:04.227
through drawing the buildings and roads

00:04:04.251 --> 00:04:05.402
on top of them.

00:04:05.426 --> 00:04:06.687
We call this a base map.

00:04:07.354 --> 00:04:09.380
On average, each time a volunteer logs in,

00:04:09.404 --> 00:04:11.966
they map an area less than
10 kilometers squared,

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.961
but add all those contributions together,

00:04:13.985 --> 00:04:16.914
and you can map entire cities
in just a couple of days.

00:04:17.936 --> 00:04:20.028
And second, local mapping.

00:04:20.447 --> 00:04:22.981
People living and working
in the places we're mapping

00:04:23.005 --> 00:04:24.897
take that base map and color it in,

00:04:24.921 --> 00:04:28.725
for example, identifying:
Is this building a school or a hospital?

00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:32.153
Those people add information
you can't see in a satellite image.

00:04:32.177 --> 00:04:34.008
We found people able and eager to map

00:04:34.032 --> 00:04:36.405
in even the most challenging
situations worldwide,

00:04:36.429 --> 00:04:38.897
and we've optimized the tools
to work on smartphones

00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:40.807
costing as little as 30 dollars.

00:04:40.831 --> 00:04:42.722
Additionally, the tools work offline,

00:04:42.746 --> 00:04:46.377
so people without regular access
to cell service can still contribute,

00:04:46.401 --> 00:04:49.261
adding things to the map
as they go about their daily lives,

00:04:49.285 --> 00:04:52.526
and then uploading when they get access
to cell service or WiFi.

00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:56.561
In 10 years, we've seen people
from all walks of life take part.

00:04:57.022 --> 00:04:59.221
Refugees have mapped broken water points.

00:04:59.245 --> 00:05:02.743
Rural women have added place names
in Indigenous languages.

00:05:02.767 --> 00:05:05.779
And, in doing so, people become
active agents of change

00:05:05.803 --> 00:05:07.461
in their communities.

00:05:07.485 --> 00:05:12.161
Since 2010, HOT has engaged
over 200,000 volunteers

00:05:12.185 --> 00:05:15.175
who have mapped an area
home to more than 150 million people

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.380
in OpenStreetMap.

00:05:16.404 --> 00:05:19.138
Those maps have been used
by search and rescue operations

00:05:19.162 --> 00:05:21.861
to free hundreds of people
trapped in collapsed buildings

00:05:21.885 --> 00:05:23.686
after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.599
They've been used to provide
polio vaccinations to children

00:05:26.623 --> 00:05:28.213
across all of rural Nigeria.

00:05:28.237 --> 00:05:31.256
And they've mapped the camps,
routes and new homes

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.258
of more than eight million refugees
fleeing South Sudan, Syria and Venezuela.

00:05:36.282 --> 00:05:39.304
We work with the biggest
humanitarian organizations in the world

00:05:39.328 --> 00:05:41.261
to make sure these maps have impact --

00:05:41.285 --> 00:05:44.675
the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières,
UNICEF to name a few --

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:47.316
and we currently have a queue
of more than 2,000 places

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.675
needing to be mapped.

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:51.419
So that's the story so far.

00:05:51.443 --> 00:05:54.097
But wouldn't it be great
if these places were on the map

00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:55.439
before they were in crisis?

00:05:55.463 --> 00:05:57.252
Now we're ready for a step change.

00:05:57.796 --> 00:05:59.174
Over the past few years,

00:05:59.198 --> 00:06:02.856
we've gained access to global,
regularly updated satellite imagery.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.255
Machine learning and AI
are helping human mappers

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:06.587
to work more efficiently.

00:06:06.942 --> 00:06:10.088
And worldwide, more and more people
are willing and able

00:06:10.112 --> 00:06:11.707
to map their communities.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.600
Over the next five years,

00:06:13.624 --> 00:06:16.988
we'll engage one million volunteers
who will map an area

00:06:17.012 --> 00:06:19.866
home to the one billion
most vulnerable people

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.660
across 94 countries.

00:06:22.026 --> 00:06:23.191
To achieve this,

00:06:23.215 --> 00:06:24.923
we need to do three things.

00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:28.996
First, we need to grow our community
to one million mappers,

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.612
who will build a world
where everyone everywhere is represented.

00:06:33.049 --> 00:06:34.940
We'll set up a network of regional hubs

00:06:34.964 --> 00:06:37.245
to train and support those volunteers

00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:40.208
to map the vulnerable places
in their own countries.

00:06:40.232 --> 00:06:42.921
Second, we need to invest in technology.

00:06:42.945 --> 00:06:46.316
Right now, you can add something
like a building or a local landmark

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.090
to the map in just a few seconds,

00:06:48.114 --> 00:06:49.365
but learning to map

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:51.577
and mapping easily
and quickly on a mobile

00:06:51.601 --> 00:06:52.784
can be a problem.

00:06:53.286 --> 00:06:55.155
We need to invest in technologies

00:06:55.179 --> 00:06:58.799
to make mobile edits to the map
possible at a massive scale.

00:06:59.341 --> 00:07:01.842
And third, we need to raise awareness.

00:07:01.866 --> 00:07:04.216
Aid projects across the world need to know

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.137
that these maps are free
and available for them to use

00:07:07.161 --> 00:07:10.724
and that they can request maps
for the areas that they're working in.

00:07:10.748 --> 00:07:13.962
For me, this is one of the most
wonderful things about this project.

00:07:13.986 --> 00:07:16.837
It isn't really about HOT
or any single organization.

00:07:16.861 --> 00:07:18.441
It's about creating a foundation

00:07:18.465 --> 00:07:21.555
on which so many
organizations will thrive.

00:07:21.992 --> 00:07:23.262
Whatever we do,

00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:26.091
disasters and crises will still happen,

00:07:26.115 --> 00:07:29.001
and humanitarians
will still respond to them.

00:07:29.413 --> 00:07:31.344
Development programs will continue,

00:07:31.368 --> 00:07:33.782
but without maps,
they'll lack critical information

00:07:33.806 --> 00:07:36.636
about what to expect in the community
before they get there.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.406
With open, free, up-to-date maps,

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.544
those programs will have more impact
than they would do otherwise,

00:07:42.568 --> 00:07:46.328
leading to a meaningful difference
in lives saved or improved.

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:50.169
But it's so much more than that.

00:07:50.704 --> 00:07:55.683
It's 2020, and one billion people
in our world are not visible.

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:57.533
That's wrong.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.783
This is a tool through which
every citizen of Planet Earth

00:08:00.807 --> 00:08:02.679
can become known and seen,

00:08:02.703 --> 00:08:04.803
to literally be put on the map.

00:08:05.263 --> 00:08:07.786
My peers complain about being
too overconnected,

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.448
so how can it be possible
for more than a billion people

00:08:10.472 --> 00:08:11.723
to remain invisible?

00:08:11.747 --> 00:08:14.622
Luckily, this is a problem
even the laziest among us

00:08:14.646 --> 00:08:16.085
can help to solve.

00:08:16.109 --> 00:08:18.477
If you can swipe left or right,

00:08:18.501 --> 00:08:19.671
you can help.

00:08:20.235 --> 00:08:21.416
Map this morning

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.454
and influence life-changing
decisions this afternoon.

00:08:24.478 --> 00:08:28.731
Frontline health workers and humanitarians
are literally waiting for you.

00:08:29.155 --> 00:08:30.373
Thank you.
