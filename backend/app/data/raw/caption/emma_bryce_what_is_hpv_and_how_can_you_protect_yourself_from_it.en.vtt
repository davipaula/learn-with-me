00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:08.307
At some point,

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:12.207
most sexually active people will be 
infected with human papillomavirus,

00:00:12.207 --> 00:00:13.937
or ‘HPV.’

00:00:13.937 --> 00:00:16.347
There are over 100 types of HPV,

00:00:16.347 --> 00:00:20.247
and most of the time the body 
eliminates infections without symptoms–

00:00:20.247 --> 00:00:23.947
but some strains can pose serious 
health risks down the line.

00:00:23.947 --> 00:00:26.937
HPV causes contact infections,

00:00:26.937 --> 00:00:30.147
which means the virus stays in the cells
near the point of infection

00:00:30.147 --> 00:00:32.727
rather than spreading throughout
the whole body.

00:00:32.727 --> 00:00:36.207
Since HPV is often transmitted through 
sexual activity,

00:00:36.207 --> 00:00:40.287
this usually means the cells of the 
vagina, vulva, penis, anus,

00:00:40.287 --> 00:00:41.797
mouth and throat.

00:00:41.797 --> 00:00:44.927
We can test for HPV in cells from 
these areas,

00:00:44.927 --> 00:00:47.797
but while testing for the virus 
is scientifically possible,

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:49.347
it isn’t common.

00:00:49.347 --> 00:00:50.767
The main reason is that,

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:54.407
while there are treatments for the 
adverse health effects caused by HPV,

00:00:54.407 --> 00:00:56.757
there’s no treatment for the virus itself.

00:00:56.757 --> 00:01:00.067
So testing for HPV would yield many, 
many positives,

00:01:00.067 --> 00:01:02.737
and although most of them won’t 
be cause for concern,

00:01:02.737 --> 00:01:07.247
there is still no treatment plan for 
clearing the body of the virus.

00:01:07.247 --> 00:01:10.823
But there are other good ways to 
protect yourself from HPV.

00:01:10.823 --> 00:01:13.813
We’re going to walk through how 
HPV can cause harm,

00:01:13.813 --> 00:01:17.233
who’s at risk, and how to 
minimize those risks.

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:21.393
The body’s immune system is able to
eradicate most strains of HPV

00:01:21.393 --> 00:01:23.478
before they cause any harm—

00:01:23.478 --> 00:01:26.808
and without people even knowing 
they’ve been infected.

00:01:26.808 --> 00:01:28.138
Certain other strains–

00:01:28.138 --> 00:01:30.338
like HPV 6 and 11–

00:01:30.338 --> 00:01:33.588
cause abnormalities in the cells of the 
infected tissue,

00:01:33.588 --> 00:01:36.228
which can develop into genital warts.

00:01:36.228 --> 00:01:39.148
While these are infectious 
and require treatment,

00:01:39.148 --> 00:01:41.068
usually with topical creams,

00:01:41.068 --> 00:01:45.068
wart-causing strains don’t create 
longer-term damage.

00:01:45.068 --> 00:01:49.788
But another 13 strains can cause DNA
mutations that cause cells to divide

00:01:49.788 --> 00:01:52.033
at a much faster pace than normal,

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:55.033
propelling the development of 
cancerous growths.

00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:57.863
The cells of the cervix are 
especially at risks.

00:01:57.863 --> 00:01:59.133
Two in particular–

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:01.393
HPV 16 and 18–

00:02:01.393 --> 00:02:05.103
are responsible for the majority of 
cases of cervical cancer,

00:02:05.103 --> 00:02:08.983
which is now the fourth most common
type of cancer in women.

00:02:08.983 --> 00:02:12.383
It can take up to 20 years for cancer 
symptoms to appear,

00:02:12.383 --> 00:02:13.753
but with regular screening,

00:02:13.753 --> 00:02:16.783
we can discover cellular abnormalities
in the cervix

00:02:16.783 --> 00:02:19.123
before they develop into cancer.

00:02:19.123 --> 00:02:22.493
Women over 21 can undergo a regular 
pap smear,

00:02:22.493 --> 00:02:25.923
where a sample of tissue is gently 
scraped from the lining of the cervix

00:02:25.923 --> 00:02:28.023
to test for abnormal cells.

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:31.743
A positive test doesn’t mean the person
has cervical cancer,

00:02:31.743 --> 00:02:34.363
but rather that there are irregular 
cells in the cervix

00:02:34.363 --> 00:02:37.663
that could develop into cancer
in the future.

00:02:37.663 --> 00:02:40.943
Patients are then either monitored 
with more frequent pap smears,

00:02:40.943 --> 00:02:43.243
or, for more severe irregularities,

00:02:43.243 --> 00:02:45.923
undergo a procedure called a colposcopy.

00:02:45.923 --> 00:02:49.873
This involves a doctor examining the 
cervix through a microscope,

00:02:49.873 --> 00:02:54.023
and possibly taking a small biopsy of 
tissue for closer examination.

00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:58.023
In some cases, the affected tissue 
may be removed.

00:02:58.023 --> 00:03:02.173
HPV infections of the throat may lead to
head and neck cancers,

00:03:02.173 --> 00:03:05.788
but for now there’s no equivalent of the 
pap smear for the throat.

00:03:05.788 --> 00:03:09.698
Using condoms helps prevent 
the spread of HPV during sex.

00:03:09.698 --> 00:03:15.438
And there are three safe, effective 
vaccines that all target HPV 16 and 18.

00:03:15.438 --> 00:03:19.038
The vaccine comes in two or three doses 
a few months apart,

00:03:19.038 --> 00:03:22.258
and it’s only beneficial if you 
receive them all.

00:03:22.258 --> 00:03:27.158
Right now the vaccine is part of standard 
care for girls aged 11 to 18

00:03:27.158 --> 00:03:28.596
in many countries–

00:03:28.596 --> 00:03:31.896
though it’s increasingly becoming 
available to boys as well.

00:03:31.896 --> 00:03:36.466
Adult women and men in countries including
the United States and the United Kingdom

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:38.442
can opt to receive the vaccine,

00:03:38.442 --> 00:03:41.262
and evidence suggests that vaccination of
women and men

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:46.902
could reduce the worldwide incidence of
cervical cancer by almost 90%.

00:03:46.902 --> 00:03:49.341
Researchers are also 
developing an injection

00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:52.981
for people who are already infected 
with HPV 16 and 18,

00:03:52.981 --> 00:03:54.791
which would target the infected cells

00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:57.821
to stop them from developing 
into cancerous ones.

00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:00.541
So while there’s still room for 
improvement in screening,

00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:02.461
treatment, and access to each,

00:04:02.461 --> 00:04:05.241
condom use, vaccination, 
and cervical screening

00:04:05.241 --> 00:04:09.351
can each reduce the harm caused by HPV.
