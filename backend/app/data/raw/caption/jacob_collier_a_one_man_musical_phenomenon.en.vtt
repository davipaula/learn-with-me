00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.240
(Music)

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.080
(Singing) I was walking down the line,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.360
trying to find some peace of mind.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.200
Then I saw you.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.880
You were takin' it slow
and walkin' it one step at a time.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.400
I said, "Listen, stranger,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.840
I'm feeling low now.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.160
I don't know which way to go."

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.359
I said, "If you're lost now,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.536
maybe I could help you along
and sing you a song,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.880
and move you on and on and on."

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.520
Singing down the line.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.560
Where shall we go? Where shall we go?

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.856
She said, "I'm looking
for a kind of shelter.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.760
A place for me to call my own.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.696
I've been walking all night long,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.480
but I don't know where to call my home."

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.456
"The only way to find that place

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.360
is close to where my heart is.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.976
I know I'm gonna get there,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.680
but I've got to keep on
walking down the line."

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.960
Down the line.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:52.720
Down the line.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.936
Thank you so much.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.920
(Applause)

00:04:08.937 --> 00:04:11.176
How's everybody feeling today?
You feeling good?

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.216
(Cheers)

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.456
Fantastic. Would everybody mind
singing with me for just one second?

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.616
Could you sing something?
Could you sing a D?

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.096
Sing "Ooh."

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.080
(Audience hums)

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.880
Oh -- louder for me, louder for me.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.959
(Singing) Oh.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.456
Now, please, if you could sing,

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.416
"Oh oh oh."

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.376
Audience: Oh oh oh.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.296
Jacob Collier: Whoa oh oh.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.016
Audience: Whoa oh oh.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.440
JC: Sing, "Whoa oh."

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.440
Audience: Whoa oh.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.000
JC: Oh oh oh.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.216
Audience: Oh oh oh.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.416
JC: Sing, "Whoa oh oh."

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.896
Audience: Whoa oh oh.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.056
JC: Sing, "Whoa oh oh."

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.896
Audience: Whoa oh oh.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.656
JC: Whoa oh oh.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.296
Audience: Whoa oh oh.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.240
JC: Sing, "Whoa oh oh."

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.440
Audience: Whoa oh oh.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.416
Thank you so much.
That's beautiful. Thank you.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.576
(Applause)

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.816
Thank you.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.176
So do you feel that motion?

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.296
Do you feel yourself
as part of that motion,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.119
things moving underneath the surface?

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.413
So the language of musical harmony
is an absolutely extraordinary one.

00:05:42.414 --> 00:05:44.858
It's a way of navigating
one's emotional frameworks,

00:05:44.859 --> 00:05:47.025
but without the need
to put things into words,

00:05:47.026 --> 00:05:49.238
and I think that,
as with many other languages,

00:05:49.263 --> 00:05:51.719
it doesn't matter how much
you know about a language.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.856
It doesn't matter
how many words you can say,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.176
how many phrases you know.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.319
What matters is the emotional choices
you make with this language.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.844
So I encourage us to embrace
this idea as a community,

00:06:00.868 --> 00:06:03.416
which is the thing which in time
may grow us towards

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.393
as opposed to away from our own humanity.

00:06:05.417 --> 00:06:06.656
Thank you so much.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.736
(Applause)

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.280
(Music)

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.280
(Singing) Take me

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:38.520
anywhere you want to go.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.720
You know that my love is strong.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.280
In my hideaway.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.640
Softly,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.480
like the calm that follows storms,

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.296
Find what I've been
searching for all along.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.880
In my hideaway.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:33.656
Even when I close my eyes,

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:39.880
darling, if you've gone astray,
I'm on my way to my hideaway.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.880
Touch me

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:01.440
like I've never loved before,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.200
in the place that I adore,

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.880
in my hideaway.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:21.400
I know

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:28.280
whichever way the wind may blow,

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.640
there will be a place for me to go

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.240
in my hideaway.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.360
My hideaway.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.896
Sticks and stones

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.560
I won't hide from you no more.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.376
And in time

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.960
I find what I've been searching for.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.336
Heard your voice

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.240
calling out to me.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.736
I'm on my way

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.480
to where I can be free.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.976
And if she won't wait for me,
do it right, don't look back,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.880
keep my heart on the future.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.599
On the soles of my shoes
all the places I've been

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.520
that I've known since I knew her.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.856
'Cause it's you, don't you know
that you're making me guess

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.176
that you're the one for me.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.440
That it's you that I guess
that I wanted to know all along.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.376
Girl, it's you that I want,
that makes me complete,

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.576
cause you're the one for me.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.000
It's thanks to you that I guess
that I want you to know I belong.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.680
One, two, three, four, five.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.216
(Applause)

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.776
Thank you so much. Thank you.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.880
(Applause)

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.280
Thank you.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.840
Thanks so much. Thank you guys.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.520
Kelly Stoetzel: OK, Jacob. Wow.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.896
OK, we have some questions.
JC: OK.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.816
KS: That was spectacular.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.576
JC: Thank you, Kelly. Thank you.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.696
KS: Those
visualizations we just saw,

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.656
those were happening in real time, yeah?

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.096
JC: Yeah, so everything visual

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.501
takes cues from things which are audial,
or something, if that's a word,

00:12:54.525 --> 00:12:56.016
and so everything is real time.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.976
I cue the loops, I play the instruments

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.376
and then the tree, for example,
that you saw grow,

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.896
grows in such a way
that it takes low long notes

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.336
and grows thick long branches,

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.576
and it takes high, quiet notes, whatever,
and then it grows thin, small branches.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.599
And then my singing voice

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.736
sort of blows wind against the tree.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.456
KS: So you're 22 years old.
JC: Yes, indeed.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.736
Moderator: You played
all of that by yourself.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.976
How did you get started
and how did this all evolve?

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.176
JC: I have this magical room in my house

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.616
in North London,
which is, like, over there.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.656
(Cheers)

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.376
Thank you. Represent North London.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.016
And this room --
I mean, this is my family home.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.456
I grew up in this room
filled with musical instruments,

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.376
but most importantly, I had a family

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.776
who encouraged me
to invest in my own imagination,

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.736
and so things I created, things I built
were good things to be building

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.256
just because I was making them,
and I think that's such an important idea.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.336
But this room was
my paradise, essentially,

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.336
and when I came to tour my album,
which is called "In My Room,"

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.616
I thought I'd try and tour
the room on the road,

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.216
and that's quite a strange idea,

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.416
but it's something that I've been
working on for a couple of years,

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.816
and it's quite exciting
to be inside the circle.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.856
KS: So this is really
like the setup in your room, here.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.976
JC: It kind of is.
It's similar to the room

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.416
in the sense that I can
generate things on the spot

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.696
and I can be spontaneous,

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.896
which is what I think both music
and all of the best ideas are all about.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:18.816
KS: So you won two Grammys

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.496
for a record that you made
in your room by yourself.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.536
And how is that even possible?
We couldn't have done that,

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.816
that couldn't have happened
five years ago even.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.176
JC: It's a brand new world.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.416
The power is now
in the hands of the creator,

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.056
as I'm sure you guys would agree,

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.256
as opposed to the big
record company executive

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.136
or the big man or something like that.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.656
It's somebody with a good idea.

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.656
Here I am at TED saying this
to you guys who know this already,

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.376
but it's somebody with a good idea
who can sow that seed.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.016
That's the person who carries
the torch into the world.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.296
And yeah, I made this album
completely on my own

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.176
and I didn't wait for somebody to say,

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.576
"Hey Jacob, you should
make an album on your own."

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.791
I just went ahead and made it
and I didn't mind what people thought,

00:14:58.815 --> 00:15:00.496
and two Grammys is a massive bonus.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:05.000
(Applause)

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.696
KS: Thank you so much, Jacob.
JC: Thanks, Kelly. Thanks so much.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.280
(Applause)
