00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:14.937
There's something
really incredible happening.

00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:17.595
So there's over a billion people

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.809
who have no access to energy
whatsoever across the world,

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:23.710
620 million of them here in Africa.

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:27.999
It costs about 1,500 dollars to connect
each household up to the grid.

00:00:28.663 --> 00:00:31.997
If you are going to wait for it,
it takes about nine years, on average,

00:00:32.021 --> 00:00:35.307
and that feels like a lifetime
when you're trying to make that happen.

00:00:35.331 --> 00:00:36.736
That's kind of unbelievable,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.061
and it's also unacceptable.

00:00:39.744 --> 00:00:41.236
So let's do something about it.

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.952
The lightbulb comes from this idea
that you have an energy system

00:00:45.976 --> 00:00:49.800
that's made up of the ideas of Tesla

00:00:49.824 --> 00:00:52.266
and the ideas of Thomas Edison.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.436
There was an evolution that said
it's not just about the lightbulb,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.795
it's about the whole system,

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:59.353
the whole energy system
that goes with that lightbulb,

00:00:59.377 --> 00:01:02.781
and what happened in that gilded age

00:01:02.805 --> 00:01:05.051
was the creation of an industrial system

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:08.028
that every country around the world
has now started to emulate.

00:01:08.052 --> 00:01:11.131
So to get to the appliances,
you need to have power stations.

00:01:11.155 --> 00:01:13.639
From power stations,
you need to have infrastructure,

00:01:13.663 --> 00:01:16.946
and that infrastructure takes you
to the point of having electricity,

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.209
and you get to the lightbulbs
and the appliances

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:20.973
that we all take for granted.

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:24.979
But the amazing thing, in a way,
is that there's a revolution happening

00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:28.052
in the villages and towns
all around us here in East Africa.

00:01:28.894 --> 00:01:33.449
And the revolution is an echo
of the cell phone revolution.

00:01:34.457 --> 00:01:36.022
It's wireless,

00:01:36.046 --> 00:01:39.610
and that revolution is about solar
and it's about distributed solar.

00:01:39.634 --> 00:01:40.912
Photons are wireless,

00:01:40.936 --> 00:01:42.972
they fall on every rooftop,

00:01:42.996 --> 00:01:47.789
and they generate enough power
to be sufficient for every household need.

00:01:49.123 --> 00:01:50.965
So that's an incredible thing.

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:52.607
There's also a problem with it.

00:01:53.408 --> 00:01:56.504
Up until now, the technology
hasn't been there to make it happen,

00:01:56.528 --> 00:02:02.322
and the mindset has been
that we have to have the grid

00:02:02.346 --> 00:02:04.109
to provide industrial growth

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:08.061
and let countries develop
and create jobs and industrialize.

00:02:09.243 --> 00:02:12.601
So we've gotten ourselves to the point

00:02:12.625 --> 00:02:15.659
where actually the costs
of building these grids

00:02:15.683 --> 00:02:17.641
and following that pattern of development

00:02:17.665 --> 00:02:19.204
are really unsustainable.

00:02:20.065 --> 00:02:25.959
If you add up the deficits
that all of the utilities run in Africa,

00:02:25.983 --> 00:02:28.359
sub-Saharan Africa,

00:02:28.383 --> 00:02:32.336
you get to a number
of 21 billion dollars every year

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.192
to maintain that system and keep it going.

00:02:35.907 --> 00:02:37.899
So an extraordinary amount of resources

00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:40.201
that's been put in to creating a system

00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:44.432
that ultimately we will have
to wait a very long time for,

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:46.941
and when it comes,

00:02:46.965 --> 00:02:49.949
it often doesn't come
with sufficient robustness

00:02:49.973 --> 00:02:52.347
to allow us to go down
that path to development.

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:54.299
So what a shame.

00:02:54.323 --> 00:02:55.854
But here's what's happening,

00:02:55.878 --> 00:02:59.290
and here's the opportunity that I think
we should all get excited about.

00:02:59.696 --> 00:03:01.546
So there's a group of companies

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.125
that have been chipping away
at this problem over the last 10 years,

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:07.220
and this group of companies

00:03:07.244 --> 00:03:11.245
have recognized the reality
that there's a great big nuclear reactor

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.439
up there in the sky,

00:03:12.463 --> 00:03:18.114
and that Africa is more endowed
with that solar power

00:03:18.138 --> 00:03:20.741
that comes from the sky, the sun,

00:03:20.765 --> 00:03:22.633
than almost any other continent.

00:03:22.657 --> 00:03:27.448
So the opportunity has come
to convert some of that solar power,

00:03:27.472 --> 00:03:31.620
wireless power, into energy
at the household level.

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:34.129
And three things have happened
at the same time.

00:03:34.153 --> 00:03:37.398
First, the costs of solar
productivity have come down.

00:03:37.422 --> 00:03:40.338
So putting a panel on your roof
and generating power from it,

00:03:40.362 --> 00:03:43.417
that cost has absolutely collapsed
over the last 30 years,

00:03:43.441 --> 00:03:46.107
and it's gone down by 95 percent.

00:03:46.583 --> 00:03:49.219
Second, the appliance network.

00:03:49.243 --> 00:03:51.942
So the group of appliances
that we've all gotten used to,

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:55.347
we all want and we all need,
we all see as part of our everyday lives

00:03:55.371 --> 00:03:57.204
that give us health and security,

00:03:57.228 --> 00:03:59.291
those appliances have come down in cost.

00:03:59.315 --> 00:04:02.492
So if you take the LED lightbulb,
for example, a very simple thing,

00:04:02.516 --> 00:04:07.269
they're now 85 percent less
than they were five years ago,

00:04:07.293 --> 00:04:12.881
and their efficiency, when you
compare them to an incandescent bulb,

00:04:12.905 --> 00:04:16.170
like the lightbulb I showed
in the previous slide,

00:04:16.194 --> 00:04:17.360
is incredible.

00:04:17.384 --> 00:04:20.572
They give you 10 times
the amount of light,

00:04:20.596 --> 00:04:22.431
and they last 30 times as long.

00:04:22.455 --> 00:04:26.192
And then the last thing that's happened
is of course the cell phone revolution,

00:04:26.216 --> 00:04:28.669
so we're piggybacking
off the cell phone revolution,

00:04:28.693 --> 00:04:32.248
and we can now make decentralized
customers make small payments

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.328
for bits of equipment and appliances

00:04:35.352 --> 00:04:38.024
where actually they're now affordable.

00:04:38.048 --> 00:04:40.968
We can pay them off
over a daily or a weekly schedule.

00:04:40.992 --> 00:04:44.030
So this is an incredible change
in the economy that's happening,

00:04:44.054 --> 00:04:47.348
and it's really opened up
something very, very innovative.

00:04:47.372 --> 00:04:50.583
So I'm going to introduce you
to a lady I met with last week.

00:04:50.607 --> 00:04:51.758
Her name's Susan.

00:04:51.782 --> 00:04:53.275
It may not look like it,

00:04:53.299 --> 00:04:57.718
but Susan is a representative
of a $27 billion market.

00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:02.559
27 billion dollars is what people
like Susan spend every year

00:05:02.583 --> 00:05:05.622
on cell phone charging,

00:05:05.646 --> 00:05:10.286
flashlight batteries and kerosene
to light their homes.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.522
So Susan is a proud owner
of a small solar system.

00:05:14.546 --> 00:05:16.889
It's a kit rather than a planetary thing,

00:05:16.913 --> 00:05:18.470
so a small solar system,

00:05:18.494 --> 00:05:22.382
and her small solar system
allows her to have a couple of lightbulbs,

00:05:22.406 --> 00:05:26.629
and she's made this transition,
this jump, from kerosene into light.

00:05:26.653 --> 00:05:28.559
She has four or five lights and a radio.

00:05:28.583 --> 00:05:30.483
It's fantastic, and she talks about it.

00:05:30.507 --> 00:05:34.225
She talks about her kids doing homework
at night because she has light.

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:36.249
I'm not sure what
the kids feel about that.

00:05:36.273 --> 00:05:41.808
She talks about the fact that she can
go out at 4am and look after the cows,

00:05:41.832 --> 00:05:43.083
and she's not so worried,

00:05:43.107 --> 00:05:46.108
but also, with a little
twinkle in her eye,

00:05:46.132 --> 00:05:50.933
she talks about how light
turns her house into a home at night.

00:05:50.957 --> 00:05:53.028
She's not scared
of her own house at night,

00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:55.861
because it has light in it,
and I thought that was amazing.

00:05:56.687 --> 00:06:00.140
So Susan does something
that many customers of these companies

00:06:00.164 --> 00:06:01.715
that I talked about do,

00:06:01.739 --> 00:06:03.938
and she forces us to innovate.

00:06:03.962 --> 00:06:07.439
She challenges companies, saying,
"I've got the radio and the lights.

00:06:07.463 --> 00:06:08.889
You know what? I'd like a TV.

00:06:08.913 --> 00:06:14.754
I'd like to entertain,
educate me and my kids.

00:06:14.778 --> 00:06:17.690
And then I would like to have
some hair clippers for my kids,

00:06:17.714 --> 00:06:20.652
you know, to cut my kids' hair,
and I'd love to have a fridge.

00:06:20.676 --> 00:06:22.645
And she's coined something

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:27.082
that the energy world
is really hungry to do.

00:06:27.106 --> 00:06:29.714
The idea that she's coined
is the energy ladder.

00:06:29.738 --> 00:06:32.047
It starts, again, with a lightbulb. Right?

00:06:32.714 --> 00:06:37.477
And the lightbulb is an idea
that we can get our kids to do homework,

00:06:37.501 --> 00:06:40.056
and very cheap, about five dollars,

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.906
and we can get it distributed.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.613
But then let's go up from there.

00:06:43.637 --> 00:06:45.879
This is the kit that Susan has:

00:06:45.903 --> 00:06:49.505
four lightbulbs, radio,
maybe a little flashlight,

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:51.554
a little solar panel on the roof.

00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:52.998
And then let's go up again.

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:57.994
We can get maybe at about 500 dollars,

00:06:58.018 --> 00:07:01.010
the previous kit was maybe $150,

00:07:01.034 --> 00:07:02.986
again, paid for over time,

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.495
two years to pay it all off,

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:05.844
you can get the TV,

00:07:05.868 --> 00:07:08.241
so the lightbulbs and the TV.

00:07:08.265 --> 00:07:11.374
And you start to ask yourself,
"So where is this headed?"

00:07:11.398 --> 00:07:13.733
Is this headed here,

00:07:13.757 --> 00:07:16.430
where we can have distributed systems

00:07:16.454 --> 00:07:18.783
with the right infrastructure
to provide power

00:07:18.807 --> 00:07:20.656
for our hospitals and our schools?

00:07:21.268 --> 00:07:23.531
And really how far can this go?

00:07:23.555 --> 00:07:27.293
And this is the mindset shift
that I think is really exciting.

00:07:27.317 --> 00:07:28.467
How far can we go?

00:07:29.258 --> 00:07:31.132
Could it get up to here?

00:07:31.156 --> 00:07:35.703
You know, this is the conceptual design
for one of the world's biggest factories,

00:07:35.727 --> 00:07:38.869
designed to be fully solar-powered
and fully off grid.

00:07:40.032 --> 00:07:41.223
Maybe we can get that.

00:07:42.794 --> 00:07:46.342
So there's a generation of these companies

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:52.637
that are out there doing this work
and creating thousands of jobs,

00:07:52.661 --> 00:07:56.515
creating, selling, tens of thousands
of these solar systems,

00:07:56.539 --> 00:07:59.462
so bringing tens of thousands
of families into light,

00:07:59.486 --> 00:08:03.246
and tackling that big $1 billion problem
that I talked about at the beginning,

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.651
and really innovating.

00:08:05.675 --> 00:08:09.635
And what they're doing is,
they're not only energy companies,

00:08:09.659 --> 00:08:11.588
they're also credit finance companies,

00:08:11.612 --> 00:08:13.682
so they're bringing
people into an economy.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.185
They're retail companies,

00:08:17.209 --> 00:08:20.499
so they're taking products out
to people in the connecting markets.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.655
And they're appliance companies,

00:08:23.679 --> 00:08:25.761
so they're developing
extraordinary products

00:08:25.785 --> 00:08:27.682
that are very efficient and very cheap.

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:31.936
So an extraordinary thing
is happening out there

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.927
that's worth recognizing.

00:08:35.126 --> 00:08:36.472
And where does it take us?

00:08:36.496 --> 00:08:40.959
From a governmental perspective,
from a social perspective,

00:08:40.983 --> 00:08:44.123
it takes us out to two really big goals.

00:08:44.147 --> 00:08:47.664
We aspire towards
energy access for everybody,

00:08:47.688 --> 00:08:54.011
and we aspire towards
a fully-functioning low-carbon economy.

00:08:54.035 --> 00:08:56.336
And we're getting to the point
where we're seeing

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.266
the fully-functioning low-carbon economy

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:03.276
is not just about
getting people onto the grid,

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.180
it's about getting people onto electricity

00:09:06.204 --> 00:09:08.942
and doing it in a way
that's really dignified.

00:09:13.248 --> 00:09:16.370
So I want us all
to picture it for a moment,

00:09:16.394 --> 00:09:18.700
really picture what this could mean:

00:09:18.724 --> 00:09:20.959
[New energy ecosystem]

00:09:20.983 --> 00:09:23.948
an energy system that's not
just about subsistence power,

00:09:23.972 --> 00:09:26.649
getting the family off the kerosene,

00:09:26.673 --> 00:09:33.180
but it's actually the full suite
of appliances and tools

00:09:33.204 --> 00:09:36.514
and productivity
that we've all gotten used to,

00:09:36.538 --> 00:09:40.267
so actually energy at a scale
that can drive industrial development.

00:09:41.274 --> 00:09:47.386
And it's the ability to have
powerful tools.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:50.982
It's the ability to be productive
in the households, as a farmer,

00:09:51.006 --> 00:09:53.913
or as a carpenter or as a tailor

00:09:53.937 --> 00:09:57.453
and get your businesses to work
and bring you into the economy.

00:09:57.477 --> 00:10:00.636
And I was working again
a couple of days ago with a farmer

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.466
just outside of Nairobi, small field,

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:06.975
and he has an irrigation pump
that's run off solar,

00:10:06.999 --> 00:10:10.418
and he was bragging about
how much of a difference it made

00:10:10.442 --> 00:10:12.800
to his productivity.

00:10:12.824 --> 00:10:15.445
When we were listening to him,
we were asking ourselves,

00:10:15.469 --> 00:10:17.541
at what point will it be

00:10:17.565 --> 00:10:21.325
that actually, you will be charging
an electric scooter off your rooftop

00:10:21.349 --> 00:10:23.356
and taking your crops to market

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:29.983
with mobility that you've charged
yourself, using your own power?

00:10:30.516 --> 00:10:32.976
And that's an extraordinary thing
that's happening,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.882
and if you listen to Susan and Francis,

00:10:34.906 --> 00:10:36.904
you get to this point where you say,

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:41.143
"These guys have
this extraordinary sense of dignity

00:10:41.167 --> 00:10:43.309
about the way they're
achieving their power,

00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:46.213
the sense of ownership
and the sense of pride,

00:10:46.237 --> 00:10:49.202
and I'm going to flip
into a little tiny video clip,

00:10:49.226 --> 00:10:52.846
which is from a distributor of one
of these companies that I'm talking about.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.378
And he puts it better
than anyone I've ever heard it.

00:10:55.402 --> 00:10:58.719
So just listen to this.

00:10:58.743 --> 00:11:01.703
Martin: So if it does happen
that we get to a point

00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:06.792
where every home has their own
independent supply of energy,

00:11:06.816 --> 00:11:09.229
that will give us the democracy of energy.

00:11:09.253 --> 00:11:10.490
That's it.

00:11:10.514 --> 00:11:12.286
And everybody has that choice,

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:15.342
and everybody knows
when they want to switch it on or off,

00:11:15.366 --> 00:11:18.905
whether they want to sell access
or whether they want to store it.

00:11:18.929 --> 00:11:22.352
That freedom getting back
into the hands of the consumer,

00:11:22.376 --> 00:11:24.460
that would be the most exciting thing.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.281
Amar Inamdar: Brilliant, right?
That was Martin,

00:11:30.305 --> 00:11:32.432
and he has a really
wonderful turn of phrase,

00:11:32.456 --> 00:11:35.464
and what a sense of vision
that he captures.

00:11:36.467 --> 00:11:38.868
So picture that for a moment:

00:11:38.892 --> 00:11:45.411
every household a proud producer
as well as consumer of energy ...

00:11:47.905 --> 00:11:51.414
the ability to generate power,
to share power, to sell power,

00:11:51.438 --> 00:11:55.357
all coming from your own generating asset
sitting on your own property.

00:11:56.255 --> 00:11:59.057
Maybe even think about
crowdsourcing with your neighbors

00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:01.287
the grid from the ground up,

00:12:01.311 --> 00:12:04.628
rather than waiting for the government
to bring it from the top down.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:11.194
So in Africa, we have this
extraordinary opportunity right now,

00:12:11.218 --> 00:12:13.652
an extraordinary opportunity,

00:12:13.676 --> 00:12:16.168
to change the world
and create an energy system

00:12:16.192 --> 00:12:19.687
that everybody will be jealous of,

00:12:19.711 --> 00:12:22.878
and everybody will look to us
as the innovators of.

00:12:23.834 --> 00:12:26.227
And that's the democracy of energy.

00:12:27.937 --> 00:12:29.088
Thank you very much.

00:12:29.112 --> 00:12:33.325
(Applause)

00:12:33.349 --> 00:12:34.905
Chris Anderson: Quick question.

00:12:34.929 --> 00:12:36.850
So it's a really exciting vision.

00:12:36.874 --> 00:12:39.857
Help us understand,
what are the key roadblocks right now?

00:12:39.881 --> 00:12:42.973
Like, what could make this go faster?

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:47.500
AI: So the first one, I think, is really
the intermittency of solar power.

00:12:47.524 --> 00:12:51.254
So the problem is that the sun
only shines for 12 hours a day,

00:12:51.278 --> 00:12:54.014
so you've got darkness for 12 hours a day,

00:12:54.038 --> 00:12:56.174
and we need to have storage solutions

00:12:56.198 --> 00:12:58.575
that are better to help us
take us down that path.

00:12:58.599 --> 00:13:00.249
So storage is really one.

00:13:00.273 --> 00:13:02.079
CA: And those prices are coming down.

00:13:02.103 --> 00:13:04.453
AI: And those prices
are coming down very quickly.

00:13:04.477 --> 00:13:06.250
Second, the appliance set.

00:13:06.274 --> 00:13:07.981
So it needs to get more efficient,

00:13:08.005 --> 00:13:09.941
and it needs to get more diverse.

00:13:09.965 --> 00:13:11.520
We need to do more of the things

00:13:11.544 --> 00:13:13.778
we in Africa want to do
with the appliance set.

00:13:13.802 --> 00:13:14.974
CA: DC appliances.

00:13:14.998 --> 00:13:16.174
AI: DC appliances,

00:13:16.198 --> 00:13:18.628
and I think there's a real
opportunity there, Chris.

00:13:18.652 --> 00:13:20.564
I think the opportunity

00:13:20.588 --> 00:13:25.119
is that we could shift some of these
21 billion dollars of subsidies

00:13:25.143 --> 00:13:28.365
that governments are spending
on the current electricity system

00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:32.317
and we could promote R&amp;D here in Africa

00:13:32.341 --> 00:13:33.999
to create some of these products,

00:13:34.023 --> 00:13:36.826
to be some of these entrepreneurs,
and make this happen.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:38.475
So create this new system here.

00:13:39.272 --> 00:13:41.476
CA: And some of the companies themselves,

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.359
I mean, there's plenty of demand there.

00:13:43.383 --> 00:13:46.302
What's holding them back
from supplying that demand?

00:13:46.326 --> 00:13:47.850
I mean, some of them talk about,

00:13:47.874 --> 00:13:50.625
they would like to sell 10x
what they can currently sell.

00:13:50.649 --> 00:13:53.367
AI: Exactly. So for many
of these capitals,

00:13:53.391 --> 00:13:56.660
it's that markets don't price
consumer risk very well,

00:13:56.684 --> 00:13:58.916
and particularly in markets like ours,

00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:02.046
in emerging markets and here in Africa.

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:05.510
So there's not enough working capital
coming into this space

00:14:05.534 --> 00:14:08.135
because the big financiers
look at this space and say,

00:14:08.159 --> 00:14:11.643
"I don't know how to price that risk,
so I'm going to stay away from it."

00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:14.028
And that's holding
a lot of these companies back.

00:14:14.052 --> 00:14:18.195
CA: Well, it's incredibly exciting
to picture what could happen here.

00:14:18.219 --> 00:14:21.983
In my mind, this might be
the biggest leapfrog of them all.

00:14:22.007 --> 00:14:24.989
And thank you for all you're doing
and for sharing that vision

00:14:25.013 --> 00:14:26.179
so powerfully.
