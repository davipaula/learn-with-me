00:00:12.731 --> 00:00:16.356
So what I'm going to talk about here is,
this is a power station.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.619
So if you've ever wondered

00:00:17.643 --> 00:00:20.176
what a couple of million
horsepower looked like,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.010
that's pretty much what it looks like.

00:00:22.034 --> 00:00:24.310
And for me, it's always
been about the rocket.

00:00:24.334 --> 00:00:26.766
In fact so much so
that when I was growing up,

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.746
the school called in my parents
to have a bit of a discussion,

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.396
because they believed that my aspirations

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.180
were unrealistic for what I wanted to do.

00:00:37.204 --> 00:00:38.205
(Laughter)

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:42.356
And they suggested that I take up a job
at the local aluminium smelter,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.476
because I was very good with my hands.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.610
But for me, aluminium,
or as you Canadians say, "aluminum,"

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:50.886
was not part of my plan at all.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.296
So I started building
rockets when I was at school.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.617
They got bigger and bigger.

00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:56.946
I actually hold an unofficial
land speed record

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.236
for a rocket bike and roller blades

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.647
while wearing a rocket pack.

00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:02.132
(Laughter)

00:01:02.156 --> 00:01:04.186
But as the rockets got larger and larger,

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.449
and more and more complex,

00:01:05.473 --> 00:01:08.516
I started to be able to think
I could do something with this.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.866
Now today we hear about very large rockets

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.190
taking humans to,
or aspiring to take humans to,

00:01:15.214 --> 00:01:17.186
the Moon, and Mars and beyond.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.906
And that's really important,

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.550
but there's a revolution going
on in the space industry,

00:01:21.574 --> 00:01:23.336
and it's not a revolution of the big,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.726
it's a revolution of the small.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.106
So here we have an average-to-large-sized
spacecraft in 1990.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.916
We can tell it's 1990
because of the powder blue smocks

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.131
for all the trained
in the clean rooms in 1990.

00:01:35.155 --> 00:01:38.896
But that was your average-to-large-sized
spacecraft in 1990.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.397
Here's a spacecraft
that's going to launch this year.

00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:44.336
This particular spacecraft
has four high-resolution cameras,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.196
a whole lot of senors,
a CoMP communication system.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.177
We're going to launch thousands
of these into the solar system

00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:51.994
to look for extraterrestrial life.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.860
Quite different.

00:01:54.586 --> 00:01:57.596
You see that Moore's law
really applied itself to spacecraft.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.826
However, the rockets
that we've been building

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.386
have been designed
for carrying these very large,

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.096
school-bus-sized spacecraft to orbit.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.686
But this kind of launch vehicle here
is not very practical

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.686
for launching something
that will fit on the tip of my finger.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.566
And to give you a sense of scale here,

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.646
this rocket is so large
that I inserted a picture of myself

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.696
in my underpants, in complete confidence,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.816
knowing that you will
not be able to find me.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.731
That's how big this rocket actually is.

00:02:23.755 --> 00:02:25.926
(Laughter)

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.189
Moving on.

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:28.986
(Laughter)

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.886
So this is our rocket --
it's called the Electron.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.206
It's a small launch vehicle

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.708
for lifting these small
payloads into orbit.

00:02:36.732 --> 00:02:39.156
And the key here
is not the size of the rocket --

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.616
the key here is frequency.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.066
If you actually wanted
to democratize space

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.379
and enable access to space,

00:02:44.403 --> 00:02:47.240
launch frequency is
the absolute most important thing

00:02:47.264 --> 00:02:48.726
out of all of this.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.168
Now in order to really democratize space,
there's three things you have to do.

00:02:53.192 --> 00:02:57.506
And each one of these three things
has kind of the equivalent amount of work.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.125
So the first is, obviously,
you have to build a rocket.

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:04.009
The second is regulatory,
and the third is infrastructure.

00:03:05.057 --> 00:03:07.296
So let's talk a little bit
about infrastructure.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.316
So this is our launch site --

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.176
it's obviously not Cape Canaveral,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.770
but it's a little launch site --

00:03:12.794 --> 00:03:15.128
in fact, it's the only private
orbiter launch site

00:03:15.152 --> 00:03:17.170
in the entire world, down in New Zealand.

00:03:17.194 --> 00:03:19.440
And you may think
that's a bit of an odd place

00:03:19.464 --> 00:03:21.796
to build a rocket company
and a launch site.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.392
But the thing is that every time
you launch a rocket,

00:03:24.416 --> 00:03:27.558
you have to close down
around about 2,000 kilometers of airspace,

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:30.436
2,000 kilometers
of marine and shipping space,

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.746
and ironically, it's one
of the things in America

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.166
that doesn't scale very well,

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.619
because every time
you close down all that airspace,

00:03:36.643 --> 00:03:40.586
you disrupt all these travelers
trying to get to their destination.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.610
The airlines really hate rocket companies,

00:03:42.634 --> 00:03:46.416
because it costs them
around $70,000 a minute, and so on.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.626
So what you really need,

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.176
if you want to truly have
rapid access to space,

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.976
is a reliable and frequent
access to space,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.266
is you need, basically,
a small island nation

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.396
in the middle of nowhere,
with no neighbors and no air traffic.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.373
And that just happened to be New Zealand.

00:04:00.397 --> 00:04:02.076
(Laughter)

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.096
So, that's kind of the infrastructure bit.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.836
Now the next bit of that is regulatory.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.036
So, believe it or not,

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.622
New Zealand is not known
for its space prowess,

00:04:11.646 --> 00:04:13.006
or at least it wasn't.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.126
And you can't just rock on up to a country

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.046
with what is essentially
considered an ICBM,

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.928
because unfortunately,
if you can put a satellite into orbit,

00:04:22.952 --> 00:04:26.496
you can use that rocket
for doing significantly nasty things.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.622
So quickly, you run afoul
of a whole lot of rules and regulations,

00:04:29.646 --> 00:04:31.476
and international treaties

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.416
of the nonproliferation of weapons
of mass destruction and whatnot.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.296
So it becomes quite complex.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.654
So in order for us
to launch down in New Zealand,

00:04:39.678 --> 00:04:43.153
we had to get the United States government
and the New Zealand government

00:04:43.177 --> 00:04:45.096
to agree to sign a bilateral treaty.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.263
And then once that bilateral
treaty was signed

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:49.516
to safeguard the technology,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.286
the New Zealand government
had a whole lot of obligations.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.886
And they had to create
a lot of rules and regulations.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.577
In fact, they had to pass laws
through a select committee

00:04:57.601 --> 00:05:00.346
and through Parliament,
ultimately, and to complete laws.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.132
Once you have laws,
you need somebody who administers them.

00:05:03.156 --> 00:05:04.941
So they had to create a space agency.

00:05:04.965 --> 00:05:07.136
And once they did,
the Aussies felt left out,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.426
so they had to create a space agency.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.856
And on and on it goes.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.452
So you see, there's a massive
portion of this, in fact,

00:05:13.476 --> 00:05:16.189
two thirds of it, that does not
even involve the rocket.

00:05:16.864 --> 00:05:18.226
(Laughter)

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.822
Now, let's talk about the rocket.

00:05:19.846 --> 00:05:23.016
You know, what I didn't say

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.486
is that we're actually licensed to launch
every 72 hours for the next 30 years.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.646
So we have more launch
availability as a private company

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.116
than America does as an entire country.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.140
And if you've got a launch every 72 hours,

00:05:35.164 --> 00:05:38.076
then that means you have to build
a rocket every 72 hours.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.537
And unfortunately, there's no such thing
as just a one-stop rocket shop.

00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:44.396
You can't go and buy
bits to build a rocket.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:46.796
Every rocket is absolutely bespoke,

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.161
every component is absolutely bespoke.

00:05:49.185 --> 00:05:51.926
And you're in a constant
battle with physics every day.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.646
Every single day,
I wake up and I battle physics.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.496
And I'll give you an example of this.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.166
So on the side of our rocket,
there's a silver stripe.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.286
The reason is because there's avionic
components behind there.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.406
We needed to lower
the emissivity of the skin

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.196
so we didn't cook
the components from the sunlight.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.616
So we paint a silver stripe.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.640
Unfortunately, as you're
sailing through the Earth's atmosphere,

00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:14.626
you generate a lot of static electricity.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.586
And if you don't have conductive paint,

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.296
you'll basically send lightning
bolts down to the Earth.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.576
So even the silver paint
has to be triboelectrificated

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.083
and certified and applied and everything,

00:06:25.107 --> 00:06:27.299
and the stickers,
they're a whole nother story.

00:06:27.323 --> 00:06:32.623
But even the simplest thing
is always, always a real struggle.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.706
Now, to the heart of any
launch vehicle is the engine.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.766
This is our Rutherford rocket engine.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.056
And usually, you measure rocket engines

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.066
in terms of time to manufacture,
in terms of sort of months

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.976
or even sometimes years,
on really big engines.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.958
But if you're launching every 72 hours --

00:06:49.982 --> 00:06:51.537
there's 10 engines per rocket --

00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:54.066
then you need to produce
an engine very quickly.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.276
We needed to come up
with a whole new process

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.406
and a whole new cycle
for the rocket engine.

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.460
We came up with a new cycle
called the electric turbo pump,

00:07:02.484 --> 00:07:05.626
but we also managed to be able
to 3D-print these rocket engines.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.420
So each one of these engines
is 3D-printed out of Inconel superalloy,

00:07:09.444 --> 00:07:14.116
and right now, we can print round
about one engine every 24 hours.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.402
Now, the electric turbo pump cycle

00:07:16.426 --> 00:07:19.316
is a totally different
way to pump propellant

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.796
into the rocket engine.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.026
So we carry about one megawatt
where the battery is on board.

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.636
And we have little electric turbo pumps,
about the size of a Coke can,

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.184
not much bigger than a Coke can.

00:07:29.208 --> 00:07:31.016
They spin at 42,000 RPM,

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.726
and each one of those
Coke-can-sized turbo pumps

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.798
produces about the same
amount of horsepower

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:37.256
as your average family car,

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.366
and we have 20 of them on the rocket.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.445
So you can see even the simplest thing,
like pumping propellants,

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:45.076
always pretty much drives you insane.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.373
This is Electron, it works.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.000
(Laughter)

00:07:49.024 --> 00:07:54.698
(Applause)

00:07:55.151 --> 00:07:58.106
Not only does it work once,
it seems to work quite frequently,

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.276
which is handy when you've got
a lot of customers to put on orbit.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.606
So far, we've put 25 satellites in orbit.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:04.869
And the really cool thing

00:08:04.893 --> 00:08:07.049
is we're able to do it
very, very accurately.

00:08:07.073 --> 00:08:11.586
In fact, we insert the satellites
to within an accuracy of 1.4 kilometers.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.492
And I guess if you're riding in a cab,

00:08:13.516 --> 00:08:15.247
1.4 kilometers is not very accurate.

00:08:15.271 --> 00:08:17.196
But in, kind of, space terms,

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.066
that equates to around
about 180 milliseconds.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.476
We travel 1.4 kilometers
in about 180 milliseconds.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.253
So, it's actually quite hard to do.

00:08:25.836 --> 00:08:26.986
(Laughter)

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.596
Now, what I want to talk
about here is space junk.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.668
We've talked a lot during
this talk about, you know,

00:08:34.692 --> 00:08:37.367
how we want to launch really
frequently, every 72 hours,

00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:38.542
and all the rest of it.

00:08:38.566 --> 00:08:40.567
However, I don't want
to go down in history

00:08:40.591 --> 00:08:43.896
as the guy that put the most
amount of space junk in orbit.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.986
This is kind of the industry's
dirty little secret here,

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:50.715
what most people don't realize
is that the majority of space junk by mass

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:54.106
is not actually satellites,
it's dead rockets.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.706
Because as you ascend to orbit,

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.016
you have to shed
bits of the rocket to get there,

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.336
with the battle of physics.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.116
So I'm going to give a little
Orbital Mechanics 101 here,

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.792
and talk about how we go to orbit,

00:09:03.816 --> 00:09:07.196
and how we do it really,
really differently from everybody else.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:09.251
So the second stage cruises along

00:09:09.275 --> 00:09:12.396
and then we separate off
a thing at the top called the kick stage,

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.376
but we leave the second stage
in this highly elliptical orbit.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.877
And at the perigee
of the orbit, or the lowest point,

00:09:17.901 --> 00:09:21.316
it dips into the Earth's atmosphere
and basically burns back up.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.566
So now we're left
with this little kick stage,

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.819
that white thing
on the corner of the screen.

00:09:25.843 --> 00:09:27.566
It's got its own propulsion system,

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.046
and we use it to raise and trim the orbit

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.776
and then deploy the spacecraft.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.167
And then because it's got its own engine,
we put it into a retro orbit,

00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:37.235
put it back into a highly
elliptical orbit,

00:09:37.259 --> 00:09:39.846
reenter it into the atmosphere
and burn it back up,

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.106
and leave absolutely nothing behind.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:45.017
Now everybody else in the industry
is just downright filthy,

00:09:45.041 --> 00:09:47.405
they just leave their crap
everywhere out there.

00:09:47.429 --> 00:09:48.430
(Laughter)

00:09:48.454 --> 00:09:52.546
(Applause)

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.770
So I want to tell you
a little bit of a story,

00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:56.180
and this is going to date me,

00:09:56.204 --> 00:10:00.499
but I went to a school at the very bottom
of the South Island in New Zealand,

00:10:00.523 --> 00:10:01.681
tiny little school,

00:10:01.705 --> 00:10:04.306
and we had a computer
not dissimilar to this one.

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.544
And attached to that computer
was a little black box called a modem,

00:10:07.568 --> 00:10:10.424
and every Friday, the class would gather
around the computer

00:10:10.448 --> 00:10:13.683
and we would send an email
to another school in America

00:10:13.707 --> 00:10:16.207
that was lucky enough
to have the same kind of setup,

00:10:16.231 --> 00:10:18.032
and we would receive an email back.

00:10:18.056 --> 00:10:21.726
And we thought that was just incredible,
absolutely incredible.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:22.996
Now I often wonder

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.136
what would happen
if I traveled back in time

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.645
and I sat down with myself

00:10:26.669 --> 00:10:29.476
and I explained all of the things
that were going to occur

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.262
because of that little black box
connected to the computer.

00:10:32.286 --> 00:10:35.176
You would largely think
that it would be complete fantasy.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.566
But the reality is that is where we are
right now with space.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:41.176
We're right on the verge
of democratizing space,

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.099
and we have essentially sent
our first email to space.

00:10:44.423 --> 00:10:46.026
Now I'll give you some examples.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.407
So last year, we flew a small satellite

00:10:48.431 --> 00:10:51.706
for a bunch of high school
students who had built it.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.886
And the high school students were studying
the atmosphere of Venus.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.772
Those are high school students
launching their own satellite.

00:10:57.796 --> 00:10:58.947
Another great example,

00:10:58.971 --> 00:11:02.050
there's a number of really big
programs right now

00:11:02.074 --> 00:11:05.012
to place large constellations,
of small satellites in orbit

00:11:05.036 --> 00:11:08.716
to deliver internet
to every square millimeter on the planet.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.740
And for pretty much
everybody in this room,

00:11:10.764 --> 00:11:11.915
that's just handy,

00:11:11.939 --> 00:11:14.546
because we can stream Netflix
anywhere we want.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.480
But if you think about the developing
countries of the world,

00:11:17.504 --> 00:11:20.320
you've just disseminated
the entire knowledge of the world

00:11:20.344 --> 00:11:22.346
to every single person in the world.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:25.396
And that's going to have
a pretty major effect.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.571
Thanks very much.

00:11:26.595 --> 00:11:31.253
(Applause)
