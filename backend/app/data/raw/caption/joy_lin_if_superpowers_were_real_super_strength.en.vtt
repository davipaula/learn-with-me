00:00:13.692 --> 00:00:15.579
If you wake up one morning

00:00:15.603 --> 00:00:19.606
with 1,000 times the strength
you had the night before,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.885
how will you handle
delicate day-to-day tasks?

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:26.258
Everything must seem so fragile to you

00:00:26.282 --> 00:00:27.806
since the scale of your strength

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.148
has expanded one thousand times.

00:00:31.172 --> 00:00:32.844
You'd have to be very careful

00:00:32.868 --> 00:00:34.488
when you're shaking someone's hand

00:00:34.512 --> 00:00:36.417
so you don't end up breaking their bones

00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:39.421
or crushing everyone you hug.

00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:43.320
And using a fork to pick
up a piece of broccoli

00:00:43.344 --> 00:00:44.412
from a Styrofoam plate

00:00:44.436 --> 00:00:46.436
without driving the fork through the plate

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.252
is going to be as difficult
as brain surgery.

00:00:51.276 --> 00:00:52.396
Say the day comes

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.259
and you get the chance
to save a damsel in distress

00:00:55.283 --> 00:00:57.659
falling from a helicopter.

00:01:00.424 --> 00:01:01.710
So, you hold out your arms,

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:02.970
hoping to catch her.

00:01:02.994 --> 00:01:04.992
Seconds later, you will find yourself

00:01:05.016 --> 00:01:07.664
holding her lifeless body.

00:01:07.688 --> 00:01:08.657
What happened?

00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:11.528
Well, pressure is force divided by area.

00:01:11.552 --> 00:01:12.767
The smaller the area,

00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:13.972
the bigger the pressure.

00:01:13.996 --> 00:01:15.859
This is why we can lift heavy objects

00:01:15.883 --> 00:01:17.405
without breaking our skin,

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:19.145
but a tiny needle can make us bleed

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:21.865
with just a little poke.

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:24.032
The pressure that will be
exerted on her body

00:01:24.056 --> 00:01:25.821
can be calculated by force

00:01:25.845 --> 00:01:28.454
divided by the area
on the top of your arms

00:01:28.478 --> 00:01:29.955
that comes in contact with her.

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.707
It doesn't matter if your arms
are strong enough

00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:34.044
to catch her body
without breaking your bones.

00:01:34.068 --> 00:01:35.497
Her spine is not strong enough

00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:37.915
to be caught by you without being damaged.

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.654
Even if you rip off the nearest door

00:01:39.678 --> 00:01:41.931
to provide a bigger
area to catch her with,

00:01:43.932 --> 00:01:46.893
you still wouldn't be
able to save her anyway.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.120
Remember, it's not
the fall that kills her,

00:01:50.144 --> 00:01:52.820
but the sudden stop at the bottom.

00:01:52.844 --> 00:01:55.178
Let's say she's falling
from a 32 story building,

00:01:55.202 --> 00:01:56.205
about 300 feet,

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.526
and you are 6 feet tall,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.204
maybe 10 feet on your tippy-toes,

00:01:59.228 --> 00:02:00.393
with your arms above your head

00:02:00.417 --> 00:02:01.228
holding a door,

00:02:01.252 --> 00:02:03.014
in hopes of distributing the pressure

00:02:03.038 --> 00:02:04.654
across a larger surface area,

00:02:04.678 --> 00:02:06.678
but all you're doing is essentially moving

00:02:06.702 --> 00:02:08.623
the ground up by 10 feet.

00:02:08.647 --> 00:02:10.908
So, she's now falling from 290 feet,

00:02:10.932 --> 00:02:12.415
instead of 300 feet,

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.675
reaching the speed of 173 feet per second

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:16.491
just before impact,

00:02:16.515 --> 00:02:18.429
not counting air resistance.

00:02:18.453 --> 00:02:21.073
It's the equivalent of crashing
at 94 miles per hour

00:02:21.097 --> 00:02:24.347
into a wall with a door in front of it.

00:02:27.684 --> 00:02:30.514
The only thing that could
save her is flying.

00:02:30.538 --> 00:02:34.134
But that power comes with its
own host of scientific issues.

00:02:34.158 --> 00:02:36.310
If you could fly,

00:02:36.334 --> 00:02:38.578
what you must do is fly up to her,

00:02:38.602 --> 00:02:40.824
start flying down at the speed
she is falling,

00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:42.063
hold on to her,

00:02:42.087 --> 00:02:43.760
then gradually slow down

00:02:43.784 --> 00:02:45.842
until you come to a complete stop.

00:02:48.272 --> 00:02:50.376
This process requires
a lot of cushion space

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.165
between the point she starts
falling and the ground.

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.195
Every second you waste

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:56.812
on changing into your superhero costume

00:02:56.836 --> 00:02:58.228
and flying up to her height,

00:02:58.252 --> 00:03:01.044
her head is getting that much
closer to the pavement!

00:03:01.068 --> 00:03:02.505
If she's falling from a high place,

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:03.671
and you can't get to her

00:03:03.695 --> 00:03:05.838
until she's only a few feet
above the ground,

00:03:05.862 --> 00:03:07.685
there's really nothing you can do

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.008
other than magically turn the pavement

00:03:10.032 --> 00:03:10.988
into marshmellow

00:03:11.012 --> 00:03:14.340
to allow her enough time
to slowly come to a stop.

00:03:16.894 --> 00:03:19.228
Then, break out the chocolate
and graham crackers

00:03:19.252 --> 00:03:21.124
and you've got s'mores.

00:03:21.148 --> 00:03:22.949
Mmmm, delicious!

00:03:26.642 --> 00:03:29.258
Now, which superpower physics lesson

00:03:29.282 --> 00:03:31.527
will you explore next?

00:03:31.551 --> 00:03:35.921
Shifting body size and content,

00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:37.317
super speed,

00:03:37.341 --> 00:03:39.067
flight,

00:03:39.091 --> 00:03:41.833
super strength,

00:03:41.857 --> 00:03:44.432
immortality,

00:03:44.456 --> 00:03:46.232
and

00:03:46.256 --> 00:03:49.252
invisibility.
