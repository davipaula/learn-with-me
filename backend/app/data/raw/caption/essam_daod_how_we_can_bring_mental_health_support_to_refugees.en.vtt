00:00:13.437 --> 00:00:15.817
For the last two and a half years,

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:19.262
I'm one of the few, if not the only,
child psychiatrist

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:22.791
operating in refugee camps,
shorelines and rescue boats

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:24.974
in Greece and the Mediterranean Sea.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.649
And I can say, with great confidence,

00:00:27.673 --> 00:00:31.125
that we are witnessing
a mental-health catastrophe

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:34.712
that will affect most of us,
and it will change our world.

00:00:35.784 --> 00:00:39.772
I live in Haifa, but nowadays,
I spend most of my time abroad.

00:00:40.204 --> 00:00:43.180
During my time
on the Greek island of Lesbos

00:00:43.204 --> 00:00:45.593
and on the rescue boats
in the Mediterranean,

00:00:45.617 --> 00:00:48.672
thousands of refugee boats
arrived to the shoreline,

00:00:48.696 --> 00:00:52.149
crowded with more
than 1.5 million refugees.

00:00:52.173 --> 00:00:54.235
One-fourth of them are children,

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:55.859
fleeing war and hardship.

00:00:56.331 --> 00:00:59.799
Each boat carries
different sufferings and traumas

00:00:59.823 --> 00:01:03.597
from Syria, Iraq, Afganistan
and different countries in Africa.

00:01:04.116 --> 00:01:05.952
In the last three years alone,

00:01:05.976 --> 00:01:09.355
more than 12,000 refugees
lost their lives.

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:13.212
And hundreds of thousands
lost their souls and their mental health

00:01:13.236 --> 00:01:15.839
due to this cruel
and traumatic experience.

00:01:17.203 --> 00:01:19.204
I want to tell you about Omar,

00:01:19.522 --> 00:01:21.545
a five-year-old Syrian refugee boy

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:24.911
who arrived to the shore on Lesbos
on a crowded rubber boat.

00:01:26.204 --> 00:01:29.593
Crying, frightened, unable to understand
what's happening to him,

00:01:29.617 --> 00:01:32.728
he was right on the verge
of developing a new trauma.

00:01:33.077 --> 00:01:35.926
I knew right away
that this was a golden hour,

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.482
a short period of time
in which I could change his story,

00:01:39.506 --> 00:01:41.006
I could change the story

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.934
that he would tell himself
for the rest of his life.

00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:47.601
I could reframe his memories.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.487
I quickly held out my hands
and said to his shaking mother in Arabic,

00:01:52.527 --> 00:01:54.467
(Arabic) "Ateeni elwalad o khudi nafas."

00:01:54.507 --> 00:01:56.351
"Give me the boy,
and take a breath."

00:01:56.887 --> 00:01:58.620
His mother gave him to me.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.664
Omar looked at me with scared,
tearful eyes and said,

00:02:03.688 --> 00:02:06.536
(Arabic) "Ammo (uncle in Arabic),
shu hada?"

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.737
"What is this?"

00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:11.250
as he pointed out to the police
helicopter hovering above us.

00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:13.442
"It's a helicopter!

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:15.832
It's here to photograph you
with big cameras,

00:02:15.856 --> 00:02:18.667
because only the great
and the powerful heroes,

00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:20.920
like you, Omar, can cross the sea."

00:02:22.413 --> 00:02:27.027
Omar looked at me,
stopped crying and asked me,

00:02:27.657 --> 00:02:28.827
(Arabic) "Ana batal?"

00:02:28.872 --> 00:02:31.131
"I'm a hero?"

00:02:32.061 --> 00:02:34.553
I talked to Omar for 15 minutes.

00:02:34.577 --> 00:02:37.276
And I gave his parents
some guidance to follow.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.205
This short psychological intervention

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:42.641
decreases the prevalence
of post-traumatic stress disorder

00:02:42.665 --> 00:02:45.149
and other mental health
issues in the future,

00:02:45.173 --> 00:02:47.601
preparing Omar to get an education,

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:50.664
join the workforce,
raise a family and beyond.

00:02:50.688 --> 00:02:51.842
How?

00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:55.122
By stimulating the good memories
that will be stored in the amygdala,

00:02:55.146 --> 00:02:57.266
the emotional storage of the human brain.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.418
These memories
will fight the traumatic ones,

00:02:59.442 --> 00:03:01.976
if they are reactivated in the future.

00:03:02.532 --> 00:03:05.295
To Omar, the smell of the sea
will not just remind him

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.477
of his traumatic journey from Syria.

00:03:07.501 --> 00:03:11.818
Because to Omar, this story
is now a story of bravery.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.593
This is the power of the golden hour,

00:03:14.617 --> 00:03:18.236
which can reframe the trauma
and establish a new narrative.

00:03:19.442 --> 00:03:25.650
But Omar is only one
out of more than 350,000 children

00:03:25.674 --> 00:03:29.705
without the proper mental health support
in this crisis alone.

00:03:30.284 --> 00:03:33.967
Three hundred and fifty
thousand children and me.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.610
We need mental health professionals

00:03:38.634 --> 00:03:42.034
to join rescue teams
during times of active crisis.

00:03:42.563 --> 00:03:47.227
This is why my wife and I and friends
co-founded "Humanity Crew."

00:03:48.193 --> 00:03:50.321
One of the few aid
organizations in the world

00:03:50.345 --> 00:03:52.964
that specializes in providing
psychosocial aid

00:03:52.988 --> 00:03:55.569
and first-response
mental health interventions

00:03:55.593 --> 00:03:58.228
to refugees and displaced populations.

00:03:58.252 --> 00:04:01.006
To provide them
with a suitable intervention,

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.458
we create the four-step approach,
a psychosocial work plan

00:04:04.482 --> 00:04:07.918
that follows the refugees
on each step of their journey.

00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:12.601
Starting inside the sea,
on the rescue boats,

00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:14.720
as mental health lifeguards.

00:04:14.744 --> 00:04:19.514
Later in the camps, hospitals
and through our online clinic

00:04:19.538 --> 00:04:22.434
that breaks down borders
and overcomes languages.

00:04:22.792 --> 00:04:26.037
And ending in the asylum countries,
helping them integrate.

00:04:26.514 --> 00:04:29.442
Since our first mission in 2015,

00:04:29.466 --> 00:04:32.283
"Humanity Crew" had 194 delegations

00:04:32.307 --> 00:04:34.847
of qualified, trained
volunteers and therapists.

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:39.434
We have provided 26,000 hours
of mental health support

00:04:39.458 --> 00:04:41.347
to over 10,000 refugees.

00:04:42.006 --> 00:04:46.815
We can all do something
to prevent this mental health catastrophe.

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:52.028
We need to acknowledge that first aid
is not just needed for the body,

00:04:52.052 --> 00:04:55.171
but it has also to include
the mind, the soul.

00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:57.703
The impact on the soul is hardly visible,

00:04:57.727 --> 00:05:00.193
but the damage can be there for life.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.065
Let's not forget that what
distinguishes us humans from machines

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:08.866
is the beautiful
and the delicate soul within us.

00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:13.259
Let's try harder to save more Omars.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.881
Thank you.

00:05:14.905 --> 00:05:18.227
(Applause)

00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:20.340
(Cheers)

00:05:20.364 --> 00:05:22.857
(Applause)
