00:00:12.952 --> 00:00:14.770
As fashion designers,

00:00:14.794 --> 00:00:18.095
our decisions have the power
to change our culture.

00:00:18.937 --> 00:00:22.966
We choose who is cast
in our runway shows and campaigns,

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.029
and ultimately, who is celebrated
and considered beautiful,

00:00:27.053 --> 00:00:28.203
and who is not.

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:32.204
Having this platform is a responsibility.

00:00:32.228 --> 00:00:34.974
One that can be utilized to exclude people

00:00:34.998 --> 00:00:36.569
or to empower others.

00:00:38.707 --> 00:00:41.651
Growing up, I was obsessed with fashion.

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:45.397
I pored over all different types
of fashion magazines

00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:47.355
at my local Barnes and Noble.

00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:52.839
To be fashionable was to be tall,
skinny, with long, shiny hair.

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:55.276
That's what I saw as the ideal,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.664
and it was reinforced everywhere I looked.

00:00:57.688 --> 00:00:59.688
And to be honest, it still is.

00:01:01.657 --> 00:01:05.216
I wanted to be like the models,
so I stopped eating.

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:07.926
It was a dark time in my life;

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.760
my eating disorder consumed me.

00:01:09.784 --> 00:01:12.871
All I could think about
was counting every single calorie,

00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:15.055
and waking up early
before school every day

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.846
so I could run a few miles.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.164
It took me years
to finally release the grip

00:01:19.188 --> 00:01:21.529
that the eating disorder had over my life.

00:01:21.927 --> 00:01:23.085
But when it did,

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:24.688
it freed up so much brain space

00:01:24.712 --> 00:01:27.339
to think about what I was truly
passionate about.

00:01:27.363 --> 00:01:28.529
For so long,

00:01:28.553 --> 00:01:31.498
the fashion industry has worked hard
to set an ideal of beauty

00:01:31.522 --> 00:01:34.887
that celebrates thin,
young, white, cisgender,

00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:37.994
able-bodied models as the ideal.

00:01:38.617 --> 00:01:40.649
It's impossible not to be bombarded

00:01:40.673 --> 00:01:42.983
with images of models
that have been photoshopped

00:01:43.007 --> 00:01:44.681
to where there's not a single pore,

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:46.657
fat roll or stretch mark in sight.

00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:49.748
You don't need to look hard
to find examples.

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:54.954
This definition of beauty is damaging,
dangerous and destructive,

00:01:54.978 --> 00:01:57.511
and we need to explode it immediately.

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:02.592
(Applause)

00:02:02.616 --> 00:02:03.957
I'm glad you agree.

00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:05.131
(Laughter)

00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:08.235
One of the worst things
I've realized over the years

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.330
is that my experience
with disordered eating

00:02:10.354 --> 00:02:11.608
is not an anomaly.

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:13.910
In fact, it's par for the course.

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:16.482
I think there's a study that says
91 percent of women,

00:02:16.506 --> 00:02:18.958
and likely those of all gender identities,

00:02:18.982 --> 00:02:21.109
are unhappy with the way they look.

00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:23.974
It's unforgivable

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:26.895
that we live in a society
where it's normal or expected

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:29.561
for teenagers to grow up
hating themselves.

00:02:31.022 --> 00:02:35.546
We've been fighting for fat acceptance
and women's body autonomy since the '60s.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.403
And there has been headway.

00:02:37.427 --> 00:02:39.808
We have plus-size models
like Ashley Graham

00:02:39.832 --> 00:02:41.847
and musicians with body-positive messages,

00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:44.482
like Lizzo, breaking into the mainstream.

00:02:44.506 --> 00:02:45.704
Thank God.

00:02:45.728 --> 00:02:46.878
(Laughter)

00:02:47.974 --> 00:02:49.164
There's brands like Area

00:02:49.188 --> 00:02:52.486
that have released campaigns
without any Photoshop retouching.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.970
But we're still inundated
with unrealistic expectations.

00:02:56.454 --> 00:02:58.732
I love this quote by Lizzo, who said,

00:02:58.756 --> 00:03:03.319
"Body positivity only exists
because body negativity is the norm."

00:03:05.668 --> 00:03:08.482
So how do we change the stigma
around looking different

00:03:08.506 --> 00:03:11.847
or not fitting into this narrow
definition of beauty?

00:03:12.462 --> 00:03:15.528
I believe it's by celebrating beauty
in all different forms,

00:03:15.552 --> 00:03:17.647
bold and unapologetically.

00:03:18.481 --> 00:03:20.734
But many fashion designers
continue to reinforce

00:03:20.758 --> 00:03:22.908
this narrow definition of beauty.

00:03:22.932 --> 00:03:24.807
From the way they are taught in school

00:03:24.831 --> 00:03:26.125
and into the real world,

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:28.791
they drape on mannequins
that are only size four,

00:03:28.815 --> 00:03:31.651
or sketch on bodies
that are super stretched out

00:03:31.675 --> 00:03:33.500
and not anatomically proportioned.

00:03:33.524 --> 00:03:35.814
Different-size bodies
aren't taken into account

00:03:35.838 --> 00:03:37.108
during the design process.

00:03:37.132 --> 00:03:38.754
They're not thought of.

00:03:38.778 --> 00:03:41.524
So who are these designers designing for?

00:03:42.968 --> 00:03:46.174
But the conversation
around exclusivity in fashion

00:03:46.198 --> 00:03:48.380
doesn't begin and end with size.

00:03:48.404 --> 00:03:51.388
It's about seeing people
of all different gender expressions,

00:03:51.412 --> 00:03:54.062
different ability levels, different ages,

00:03:54.086 --> 00:03:55.633
different races and ethnicities,

00:03:55.657 --> 00:03:57.752
celebrated for their own unique beauty.

00:03:57.776 --> 00:03:59.553
In my own work as a fashion designer,

00:03:59.577 --> 00:04:01.268
I started a brand called Chromat,

00:04:01.292 --> 00:04:05.617
and we're committed to empowering
women, femmes and nonbinary #ChromatBABES,

00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:07.641
of all shapes and sizes,

00:04:07.665 --> 00:04:10.547
through perfectly fit garments
for every body.

00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:13.364
Swimwear has become a huge focus for me,

00:04:13.388 --> 00:04:15.920
because of the power
that this single garment can have

00:04:15.944 --> 00:04:18.084
over the way people feel about themselves.

00:04:18.476 --> 00:04:21.891
We wanted to take our focus
on celebrating all body types

00:04:21.915 --> 00:04:24.756
to a garment that's fraught
with insecurity.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.620
On our runways, you see curves,
cellulite and scars worn proudly.

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:31.514
We're a runway show, yes,

00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:33.471
but we're also a celebration.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.141
I didn't start designing 10 years ago

00:04:36.165 --> 00:04:38.641
with the mission to change
the entire industry.

00:04:38.665 --> 00:04:40.418
But the models we cast at the time,

00:04:40.442 --> 00:04:43.831
who just happened to be my friends
who had begged to be in my shows,

00:04:43.855 --> 00:04:45.887
were so radical to some people,

00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:48.847
and, unfortunately,
still are different or strange to some,

00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:51.776
that it became a huge part
of what we're known for.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.091
However, inclusivity means nothing
if it's only surface level.

00:04:58.473 --> 00:04:59.639
Behind the scenes,

00:04:59.663 --> 00:05:01.901
from the photographer,
to the casting director,

00:05:01.925 --> 00:05:03.082
to the interns,

00:05:03.106 --> 00:05:05.981
who is making the decisions
behind the scenes

00:05:06.005 --> 00:05:07.822
is just as important.

00:05:08.601 --> 00:05:12.344
It's imperative to include
diverse decision-makers in the process,

00:05:12.368 --> 00:05:15.955
and it's always better
to collaborate with different communities,

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:18.246
rather than trying to speak for them.

00:05:19.868 --> 00:05:21.942
And this is an important
piece of the puzzle

00:05:21.966 --> 00:05:24.077
that many young designers
may not think about

00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:26.132
when they're first starting their careers,

00:05:26.156 --> 00:05:28.640
but hiring a plus-size
or a transgender photographer,

00:05:28.664 --> 00:05:30.783
or a woman of color
as your casting director,

00:05:30.807 --> 00:05:33.868
or a black makeup artist --
hey, Fatima Thomas --

00:05:33.892 --> 00:05:37.196
who intimately understands
how important it is

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.410
to be able to work with all skin tones:

00:05:39.434 --> 00:05:43.490
it's essential to creating
a holistically inclusive output,

00:05:43.514 --> 00:05:44.671
like this one.

00:05:44.695 --> 00:05:47.450
As a fashion designers
that do a lot of swim,

00:05:47.474 --> 00:05:50.807
we wanted to rewrite the rules
around having a bikini body.

00:05:51.132 --> 00:05:53.307
So we cast a team of babe guards

00:05:53.331 --> 00:05:57.399
to enforce guidelines around inclusion
and acceptance at the pool.

00:05:58.947 --> 00:06:01.296
Instead of "no diving" and "no running,"

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.788
how about "celebrate cellulite,"

00:06:03.812 --> 00:06:05.371
"body policing prohibited,"

00:06:05.395 --> 00:06:07.450
and "intolerance not tolerated."

00:06:07.474 --> 00:06:11.609
And this was enforced by babe guards
Mama Cax, Denise Bidot,

00:06:11.633 --> 00:06:15.034
Geena Rocero, Ericka Hart and Emme,

00:06:15.058 --> 00:06:17.447
all activists in their own right.

00:06:17.471 --> 00:06:20.724
I've always felt it was important
to show a range of different bodies

00:06:20.748 --> 00:06:22.447
in our runway shows and campaigns.

00:06:22.471 --> 00:06:24.403
But it actually wasn't until recently

00:06:24.427 --> 00:06:27.466
that we were able to expand
our size range in a major way.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.355
We first launched our curve collection

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:30.537
five years ago;

00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:31.974
we were so excited.

00:06:31.998 --> 00:06:34.434
But when it launched, it fell flat.

00:06:34.458 --> 00:06:36.093
Nobody was interested.

00:06:36.117 --> 00:06:39.323
None of our department stores
stocked above a size large,

00:06:39.347 --> 00:06:42.511
and if they did, it was somewhere else
in the building entirely.

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:44.730
In fact, one time our sales team said,

00:06:44.754 --> 00:06:46.877
"You know, it's so cool
you have trans models

00:06:46.901 --> 00:06:48.540
and curve models on the runway --

00:06:48.564 --> 00:06:49.810
I love what you're doing.

00:06:49.834 --> 00:06:52.788
But when the buyers come in
to see the collection for market,

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:54.201
they want to be sold a dream,

00:06:54.225 --> 00:06:56.887
they want to see something
that they aspire to be."

00:06:56.911 --> 00:06:59.444
Implying that our models weren't that.

00:07:01.058 --> 00:07:03.264
But I've realized
it's so much more important

00:07:03.288 --> 00:07:05.755
to open up this dream to more people.

00:07:06.527 --> 00:07:07.828
I want the consumer to know

00:07:07.852 --> 00:07:10.442
that it's not your body
that needs to change --

00:07:10.466 --> 00:07:11.616
it's the clothes.

00:07:12.413 --> 00:07:18.085
(Applause)

00:07:18.109 --> 00:07:22.576
There needs to be more fashion options
at all sizes and in all retailers.

00:07:24.546 --> 00:07:26.297
So finally, in 2018,

00:07:26.321 --> 00:07:29.537
Nordstrom actually
placed an order up to 3X.

00:07:29.561 --> 00:07:31.505
And this was a huge game changer for us

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:35.094
to have a major retailer invest
in adding these units,

00:07:35.118 --> 00:07:37.275
so we could go to the factory --

00:07:37.299 --> 00:07:41.376
now we go up to 4X,
which is about a size 32.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.709
Having that investment

00:07:42.733 --> 00:07:46.264
helped us to change and realign
our entire design process.

00:07:46.288 --> 00:07:49.783
We now have different-sized bodies
to sketch and drape on in the studio.

00:07:50.244 --> 00:07:52.872
And if more fashion schools
taught these skills,

00:07:52.896 --> 00:07:56.370
more designers would have the ability
to design for all bodies.

00:07:56.672 --> 00:08:01.595
(Applause)

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:06.985
So as fashion designers,
it's our job to utilize our platform

00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:10.918
to explode this narrow
and restrictive definition of beauty.

00:08:10.942 --> 00:08:12.236
My goal is that one day,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.522
teenagers growing up don't feel
the same pressure that I did to conform.

00:08:17.174 --> 00:08:20.635
And I hope that our work contributes
to the fashion industry's opening up

00:08:20.659 --> 00:08:23.334
to celebrate many different identities.

00:08:23.358 --> 00:08:24.508
Thank you.

00:08:24.532 --> 00:08:28.738
(Applause and cheers)
