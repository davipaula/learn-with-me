00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:14.869
I will lend books to people,
but of course, the rule is

00:00:14.893 --> 00:00:19.156
"Don't do that unless you never
intend to see that book again."

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.331
[Small thing.]

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:21.624
[Big idea.]

00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:28.569
The physical object of a book
is almost like a person.

00:00:28.593 --> 00:00:30.769
I mean, it has a spine
and it has a backbone.

00:00:30.793 --> 00:00:32.189
It has a face.

00:00:32.213 --> 00:00:34.729
Actually, it can sort of be your friend.

00:00:34.753 --> 00:00:37.919
Books record the basic human experience

00:00:37.943 --> 00:00:39.859
like no other medium can.

00:00:39.883 --> 00:00:41.389
Before there were books,

00:00:41.413 --> 00:00:43.999
ancient civilizations would record things

00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:47.609
by notches on bones
or rocks or what have you.

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:52.299
The first books as we know them
originated in ancient Rome.

00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:54.269
We go by a term called the codex,

00:00:54.293 --> 00:00:56.669
where they would have
two heavy pieces of wood

00:00:56.693 --> 00:00:57.940
which become the cover,

00:00:57.964 --> 00:01:02.279
and then the pages in between
would then be stitched along one side

00:01:02.303 --> 00:01:06.199
to make something that was relatively
easily transportable.

00:01:06.223 --> 00:01:08.649
They all had to completely
be done by hand,

00:01:08.673 --> 00:01:11.399
which became the work
of what we know as a scribe.

00:01:11.423 --> 00:01:14.609
And frankly, they were luxury items.

00:01:14.633 --> 00:01:18.069
And then a printer
named Johannes Gutenberg,

00:01:18.093 --> 00:01:23.763
in the mid-fifteenth century,
created the means to mass-produce a book,

00:01:23.787 --> 00:01:25.449
the modern printing press.

00:01:25.473 --> 00:01:26.763
It wasn't until then

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:31.269
that there was any kind of consumption
of books by a large audience.

00:01:31.293 --> 00:01:36.269
Book covers started to come into use
in the early nineteenth century,

00:01:36.293 --> 00:01:38.669
and they were called dust wrappers.

00:01:38.693 --> 00:01:40.839
They usually had advertising on them.

00:01:40.863 --> 00:01:43.319
So people would take them off
and throw them away.

00:01:43.343 --> 00:01:47.223
It wasn't until the turn of the nineteenth
into the twentieth century

00:01:47.247 --> 00:01:51.868
that book jackets could be seen
as interesting design

00:01:51.892 --> 00:01:53.479
in and of themselves.

00:01:53.503 --> 00:01:55.959
Such that I look at that and I think,

00:01:55.983 --> 00:01:57.489
"I want to read that.

00:01:57.513 --> 00:01:59.179
That interests me."

00:01:59.203 --> 00:02:03.427
The physical book itself represents
both a technological advance

00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:06.309
but also a piece of technology
in and of itself.

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:09.119
It delivered a user interface

00:02:09.143 --> 00:02:12.809
that was unlike anything
that people had before.

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:16.079
And you could argue
that it's still the best way

00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:18.493
to deliver that to an audience.

00:02:18.517 --> 00:02:22.109
I believe that the core purpose
of a physical book

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:25.209
is to record our existence

00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:30.706
and to leave it behind
on a shelf, in a library, in a home,

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.919
for generations down the road
to understand where they came from,

00:02:35.943 --> 00:02:39.359
that people went through
some of the same things

00:02:39.383 --> 00:02:40.699
that they're going through,

00:02:40.723 --> 00:02:43.933
and it's like a dialogue
that you have with the author.

00:02:43.957 --> 00:02:47.815
I think you have a much more human
relationship to a printed book

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:50.739
than you do to one that's on a screen.

00:02:50.763 --> 00:02:54.419
People want the experience of holding it,

00:02:54.443 --> 00:02:58.729
of turning the page,
of marking their progress in a story.

00:02:58.753 --> 00:03:02.305
And then you have, of all things,
the smell of a book.

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.489
Fresh ink on paper
or the aging paper smell.

00:03:06.513 --> 00:03:08.999
You don't really get that
from anything else.

00:03:09.023 --> 00:03:13.059
The book itself, you know,
can't be turned off with a switch.

00:03:13.083 --> 00:03:15.909
It's a story that you can
hold in your hand

00:03:15.933 --> 00:03:17.296
and carry around with you

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.449
and that's part of what makes
them so valuable,

00:03:20.473 --> 00:03:24.542
and I think will make them valuable
for the duration.

00:03:25.293 --> 00:03:26.562
A shelf of books, frankly,

00:03:26.586 --> 00:03:28.459
is made to outlast you, (Laughs)

00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:29.923
no matter who you are.
