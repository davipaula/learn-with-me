00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.236
Imagine the brain could reboot,

00:00:09.236 --> 00:00:14.414
updating its withered and damaged cells
with new, improved units.

00:00:14.414 --> 00:00:16.657
That may sound like science fiction,

00:00:16.657 --> 00:00:20.936
but it's a potential reality
scientists are investigating right now.

00:00:20.936 --> 00:00:24.504
Will our brains one day 
be able to self-repair?

00:00:24.504 --> 00:00:28.319
It's well known that embryonic cells
in our young developing brains

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.335
produce new neurons,

00:00:30.335 --> 00:00:33.777
the microscopic units 
that make up the brain's tissue.

00:00:33.777 --> 00:00:39.242
Those newly generated neurons migrate
to various parts of the developing brain,

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:43.132
making it self-organize 
into different structures.

00:00:43.132 --> 00:00:44.445
But until recently,

00:00:44.445 --> 00:00:50.037
scientists thought cell production came to
an abrupt halt soon after this initial growth,

00:00:50.037 --> 00:00:52.793
leading them to conclude 
that neurological diseases,

00:00:52.793 --> 00:00:54.977
like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's,

00:00:54.977 --> 00:00:59.760
and damaging events, like strokes,
are irreversible.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.623
But a series of recent discoveries

00:01:01.623 --> 00:01:06.604
has revealed that adult brains 
actually do continue to produce new cells

00:01:06.604 --> 00:01:09.465
in at least three specialized locations.

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:12.421
This process, known as neurogenesis,

00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:16.083
involves dedicated brain cells,
called neural stem cells

00:01:16.083 --> 00:01:17.915
and progenitor cells,

00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:22.250
which manufacture new neurons
or replace the old ones.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.209
The three regions where neurogenesis
has been discovered

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:29.351
are the dentate gyrus,
associated with learning and memory,

00:01:29.351 --> 00:01:33.936
the subventricular zone, which may
supply neurons to the olfactory bulb

00:01:33.936 --> 00:01:36.856
for communication 
between the nose and brain,

00:01:36.856 --> 00:01:40.170
and the striatum, 
which helps manage movement.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.992
Scientists don't yet have a good grasp
on exactly what role

00:01:43.992 --> 00:01:47.622
neurogenesis plays 
in any of these regions,

00:01:47.622 --> 00:01:51.989
or why they have this ability 
that's absent from the rest of the brain,

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:56.739
but the mere presence of a mechanism
to grown new neurons in the adult brain

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:59.596
opens up an amazing possibility.

00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:04.657
Could we harness that mechanism
to get the brain to heal its scars

00:02:04.657 --> 00:02:07.876
similar to how new skin
grows to patch up a wound,

00:02:07.876 --> 00:02:11.889
or a broken bone 
stitches itself back together?

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:13.779
So here's where we stand.

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:18.050
Certain proteins and other small molecules
that mimick those proteins

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.136
can be administered to the brain

00:02:20.136 --> 00:02:22.934
to make neural stem cells 
and progenitor cells

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:26.595
produce more neurons 
in those three locations.

00:02:26.595 --> 00:02:28.742
This technique still needs improvement

00:02:28.742 --> 00:02:31.156
so that the cells 
reproduce more efficiently

00:02:31.156 --> 00:02:33.077
and more cells survive.

00:02:33.077 --> 00:02:36.416
But research shows that progenitor cells
from these areas

00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:40.019
can actually migrate to places where
injury has occurred

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.195
and give rise to new neurons there.

00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:45.313
And another promising possible approach

00:02:45.313 --> 00:02:48.307
is to transplant healthy 
human neural stem cells,

00:02:48.307 --> 00:02:51.842
which are cultured in a laboratory,
to injured tissue,

00:02:51.842 --> 00:02:53.760
like we can do with skin.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.668
Scientists are currently experimenting

00:02:55.668 --> 00:03:00.820
to determine whether transplanted
donor cells can divide, differentiate

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.153
and successfully give rise 
to new neurons in a damaged brain.

00:03:06.153 --> 00:03:07.345
They've also discovered

00:03:07.345 --> 00:03:10.397
that we might be able to teach
other kinds of brain cells,

00:03:10.397 --> 00:03:13.738
such as astrocytes
or oligodendrocytes

00:03:13.738 --> 00:03:18.653
to behave like neural stem cells
and start generating neurons, too.

00:03:18.653 --> 00:03:22.990
So, a couple of decades from now
will our brains be able to self-repair?

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.719
We can't say for sure,

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:29.066
but that has become one of the major 
goals of regenerative medicine.

00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:31.850
The human brain has 100 billion neurons

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.762
and we're still figuring out the wiring
behind this huge biological motherboard.

00:03:37.762 --> 00:03:44.476
But everyday, research on neurogenesis
brings us closer to that reboot switch.
