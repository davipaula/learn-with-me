00:00:12.515 --> 00:00:17.643
I want you to travel back in time with me,

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:21.143
to the before time, to 2017.

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:22.893
I don't know if you can remember it,

00:00:22.917 --> 00:00:24.809
dinosaurs were roaming the earth.

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:26.559
I was a security researcher,

00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:29.351
I had spent about five or six years

00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:32.434
doing research on the ways in which APTs,

00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:36.833
which is short for advanced
persistent threats,

00:00:37.417 --> 00:00:40.684
which stands for nation-state actors,

00:00:40.708 --> 00:00:44.726
spy on journalists and activists

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.976
and lawyers and scientists

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.684
and just generally people
who speak truth to power.

00:00:50.708 --> 00:00:53.101
And I'd been doing this for a while

00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:57.393
when I discovered
that one of my fellow researchers,

00:00:57.417 --> 00:01:00.143
with whom I had been
doing this all this time,

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:05.208
was allegedly a serial rapist.

00:01:06.542 --> 00:01:08.976
So the first thing that I did

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.976
was I read a bunch of articles about this.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.018
And in January of 2018,

00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:20.101
I read an article
with some of his alleged victims.

00:01:20.125 --> 00:01:24.226
And one of the things
that really struck me about this article

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.059
is how scared they were.

00:01:26.083 --> 00:01:27.768
They were really frightened,

00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:32.934
they had, you know,
tape over the cameras on their phones

00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.226
and on their laptops,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.101
and what they were worried about
was that he was a hacker

00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:39.078
and he was going to hack into their stuff

00:01:39.102 --> 00:01:41.268
and he was going to ruin their lives.

00:01:41.292 --> 00:01:44.476
And this had kept them silent
for a really long time.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.583
So, I was furious.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:52.893
And I didn't want anyone
to ever feel that way again.

00:01:52.917 --> 00:01:55.809
So I did what I usually do when I'm angry:

00:01:55.833 --> 00:01:57.101
I tweeted.

00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:59.309
(Laughter)

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:00.768
And the thing that I tweeted

00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:04.768
was that if you are a woman
who has been sexually abused by a hacker

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:08.226
and that hacker has threatened
to break into your devices,

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.893
that you could contact me

00:02:09.917 --> 00:02:11.809
and I would try to make sure

00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:16.601
that your device got a full,
sort of, forensic look over.

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:19.101
And then I went to lunch.

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:20.708
(Laughter)

00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:23.643
Ten thousand retweets later,

00:02:23.667 --> 00:02:25.101
(Laughter)

00:02:25.125 --> 00:02:28.542
I had accidentally started a project.

00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:34.518
So every morning,
I woke up and my mailbox was full.

00:02:34.542 --> 00:02:40.351
It was full of the stories
of men and women

00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:45.226
telling me the worst thing
that had ever happened to them.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.018
I was contacted by women
who were being spied on by men,

00:02:50.042 --> 00:02:52.268
by men who were being spied on by men,

00:02:52.292 --> 00:02:54.393
by women who were being spied on by women,

00:02:54.417 --> 00:02:56.976
but the vast majority
of the people contacting me

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.809
were women who had been
sexually abused by men

00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:03.268
who were now spying on them.

00:03:03.292 --> 00:03:05.101
The one particularly interesting case

00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:07.143
involved a man who came to me,

00:03:07.167 --> 00:03:12.268
because his boyfriend had outed him as gay

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:15.518
to his extremely
conservative Korean family.

00:03:15.542 --> 00:03:20.667
So this is not just
men-spying-on-women issue.

00:03:22.292 --> 00:03:25.434
And I'm here to share

00:03:25.458 --> 00:03:27.875
what I learned from this experience.

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:32.184
What I learned is that data leaks.

00:03:32.208 --> 00:03:34.143
It's like water.

00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:35.893
It gets in places you don't want it.

00:03:35.917 --> 00:03:37.184
Human leaks.

00:03:37.208 --> 00:03:39.351
Your friends give away
information about you.

00:03:39.375 --> 00:03:42.268
Your family gives away
information about you.

00:03:42.292 --> 00:03:43.559
You go to a party,

00:03:43.583 --> 00:03:46.684
somebody tags you as having been there.

00:03:46.708 --> 00:03:48.309
And this is one of the ways

00:03:48.333 --> 00:03:50.476
in which abusers pick up
information about you

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.518
that you don't otherwise
want them to know.

00:03:52.542 --> 00:03:57.934
It is not uncommon for abusers
to go to friends and family

00:03:57.958 --> 00:04:01.101
and ask for information
about their victims

00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:04.292
under the guise of being concerned
about their "mental health."

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.476
A form of leak that I saw

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.934
was actually what we call
account compromise.

00:04:11.958 --> 00:04:14.893
So your Gmail account,

00:04:14.917 --> 00:04:17.559
your Twitter account,

00:04:17.583 --> 00:04:19.809
your Instagram account,

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:21.976
your iCloud,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.643
your Apple ID,

00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:25.268
your Netflix, your TikTok --

00:04:25.292 --> 00:04:27.125
I had to figure out what a TikTok was.

00:04:28.417 --> 00:04:30.309
If it had a login,

00:04:30.333 --> 00:04:33.101
I saw it compromised.

00:04:33.125 --> 00:04:37.768
And the reason for that is because
your abuser is not always your abuser.

00:04:37.792 --> 00:04:42.226
It is really common for people
in relationships to share passwords.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.851
Furthermore, people who are intimate,

00:04:44.875 --> 00:04:46.434
who know a lot about each other,

00:04:46.458 --> 00:04:48.476
can guess each other's security questions.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.559
Or they can look over
each other's shoulders

00:04:50.583 --> 00:04:53.559
to see what code they're using
in order to lock their phones.

00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:56.226
They frequently have
physical access to the phone,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.976
or they have physical access
to the laptop.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.976
And this gives them a lot of opportunity

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.309
to do things to people's accounts,

00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:08.143
which is very dangerous.

00:05:08.167 --> 00:05:11.101
The good news is that we have advice

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:13.434
for people to lock down their accounts.

00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:17.434
This advice already exists,
and it comes down to this:

00:05:17.458 --> 00:05:22.292
Use strong, unique passwords
for all of your accounts.

00:05:23.542 --> 00:05:26.768
Use more strong, unique passwords

00:05:26.792 --> 00:05:30.018
as the answers to your security questions,

00:05:30.042 --> 00:05:33.893
so that somebody who knows
the name of your childhood pet

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:35.542
can't reset your password.

00:05:36.542 --> 00:05:41.018
And finally, turn on the highest level
of two-factor authentication

00:05:41.042 --> 00:05:43.184
that you're comfortable using.

00:05:43.208 --> 00:05:47.226
So that even if an abuser
manages to steal your password,

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.309
because they don't have the second factor,

00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:52.059
they will not be able
to log into your account.

00:05:52.083 --> 00:05:54.268
The other thing that you should do

00:05:54.292 --> 00:05:59.684
is you should take a look
at the security and privacy tabs

00:05:59.708 --> 00:06:01.018
for most of your accounts.

00:06:01.042 --> 00:06:03.268
Most accounts have
a security or privacy tab

00:06:03.292 --> 00:06:07.393
that tells you
what devices are logging in,

00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:10.059
and it tells you where
they're logging in from.

00:06:10.083 --> 00:06:11.601
For example, here I am,

00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:13.684
logging in to Facebook from the La Quinta,

00:06:13.708 --> 00:06:15.280
where we are having this meeting,

00:06:15.304 --> 00:06:17.268
and if for example,

00:06:17.292 --> 00:06:19.559
I took a look at my Facebook logins

00:06:19.583 --> 00:06:22.184
and I saw somebody logging in from Dubai,

00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:24.184
I would find that suspicious,

00:06:24.208 --> 00:06:26.833
because I have not been
to Dubai in some time.

00:06:28.125 --> 00:06:31.018
But sometimes, it really is a RAT.

00:06:31.042 --> 00:06:34.143
If by RAT you mean remote access tool.

00:06:34.167 --> 00:06:37.226
And remote access tool

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.934
is essentially what we mean
when we say stalkerware.

00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:45.643
So one of the reasons why
getting full access to your device

00:06:45.667 --> 00:06:47.976
is really tempting for governments

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.893
is the same reason why
getting full access to your device

00:06:50.917 --> 00:06:56.000
is tempting for abusive partners
and former partners.

00:06:57.042 --> 00:07:01.143
We carry tracking devices
around in our pockets all day long.

00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:04.809
We carry devices
that contain all of our passwords,

00:07:04.833 --> 00:07:07.184
all of our communications,

00:07:07.208 --> 00:07:09.851
including our end-to-end
encrypted communications.

00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:13.101
All of our emails, all of our contacts,

00:07:13.125 --> 00:07:16.726
all of our selfies are all in one place,

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.268
often our financial information
is also in this place.

00:07:20.292 --> 00:07:23.393
And so, full access to a personâ€™s phone

00:07:23.417 --> 00:07:27.542
is the next best thing
to full access to a person's mind.

00:07:28.375 --> 00:07:33.559
And what stalkerware does
is it gives you this access.

00:07:33.583 --> 00:07:37.559
So, you may ask, how does it work?

00:07:37.583 --> 00:07:39.184
The way stalkerware works

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:42.934
is that it's a commercially
available program,

00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:46.476
which an abuser purchases,

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.476
installs on the device
that they want to spy on,

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.476
usually because they have physical access

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:56.809
or they can trick their target
into installing it themselves,

00:07:56.833 --> 00:07:58.101
by saying, you know,

00:07:58.125 --> 00:08:01.809
"This is a very important program
you should install on your device."

00:08:01.833 --> 00:08:06.101
And then they pay the stalkerware company

00:08:06.125 --> 00:08:08.893
for access to a portal,

00:08:08.917 --> 00:08:12.184
which gives them all
of the information from that device.

00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:15.559
And you're usually paying
something like 40 bucks a month.

00:08:15.583 --> 00:08:19.042
So this kind of spying
is remarkably cheap.

00:08:21.875 --> 00:08:23.476
Do these companies know

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.226
that their tools

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.684
are being used as tools of abuse?

00:08:30.708 --> 00:08:31.976
Absolutely.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.809
If you take a look
at the marketing copy for Cocospy,

00:08:34.833 --> 00:08:36.351
which is one of these products,

00:08:36.375 --> 00:08:39.518
it says right there on the website

00:08:39.542 --> 00:08:43.351
that Cocospy allows you
to spy on your wife with ease,

00:08:43.375 --> 00:08:45.601
"You do not have to worry
about where she goes,

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:48.559
who she talks to
or what websites she visits."

00:08:48.583 --> 00:08:49.833
So that's creepy.

00:08:50.583 --> 00:08:54.143
HelloSpy, which is another such product,

00:08:54.167 --> 00:08:58.809
had a marketing page
in which they spent most of their copy

00:08:58.833 --> 00:09:00.809
talking about the prevalence of cheating

00:09:00.833 --> 00:09:03.518
and how important it is
to catch your partner cheating,

00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:06.559
including this fine picture of a man

00:09:06.583 --> 00:09:09.059
who has clearly just caught
his partner cheating

00:09:09.083 --> 00:09:10.351
and has beaten her.

00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:12.893
She has a black eye,
there is blood on her face.

00:09:12.917 --> 00:09:17.018
And I don't think that there is
really a lot of question

00:09:17.042 --> 00:09:21.934
about whose side HelloSpy is on
in this particular case.

00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:24.500
And who they're trying to sell
their product to.

00:09:26.625 --> 00:09:32.601
It turns out that if you have stalkerware
on your computer or on your phone,

00:09:32.625 --> 00:09:36.643
it can be really difficult to know
whether or not it's there.

00:09:36.667 --> 00:09:38.226
And one of the reasons for that

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.851
is because antivirus companies

00:09:40.875 --> 00:09:47.476
often don't recognize
stalkerware as malicious.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.768
They don't recognize it as a Trojan

00:09:49.792 --> 00:09:52.851
or as any of the other stuff
that you would normally find

00:09:52.875 --> 00:09:54.393
that they would warn you about.

00:09:54.417 --> 00:09:58.226
These are some results
from earlier this year from VirusTotal.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.934
I think that for one sample
that I looked at

00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:05.643
I had something like
a result of seven out of 60

00:10:05.667 --> 00:10:09.059
of the platforms recognized
the stalkerware that I was testing.

00:10:09.083 --> 00:10:12.559
And here is another one
where I managed to get 10,

00:10:12.583 --> 00:10:14.226
10 out of 61.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.958
So this is still some very bad results.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.351
I have managed to convince
a couple of antivirus companies

00:10:23.375 --> 00:10:26.518
to start marking stalkerware as malicious.

00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:27.809
So that all you have to do

00:10:27.833 --> 00:10:30.601
if you're worried about having
this stuff on your computer

00:10:30.625 --> 00:10:33.684
is you download the program,

00:10:33.708 --> 00:10:36.101
you run a scan and it tells you

00:10:36.125 --> 00:10:39.768
"Hey, there's some potentially
unwanted program on your device."

00:10:39.792 --> 00:10:42.101
It gives you the option of removing it,

00:10:42.125 --> 00:10:44.059
but it does not remove it automatically.

00:10:44.083 --> 00:10:45.601
And one of the reasons for that

00:10:45.625 --> 00:10:47.518
is because of the way that abuse works.

00:10:47.542 --> 00:10:50.768
Frequently, victims of abuse aren't sure

00:10:50.792 --> 00:10:53.268
whether or not they want
to tip off their abuser

00:10:53.292 --> 00:10:55.059
by cutting off their access.

00:10:55.083 --> 00:11:01.184
Or they're worried that their abuser
is going to escalate to violence

00:11:01.208 --> 00:11:03.518
or perhaps even greater violence

00:11:03.542 --> 00:11:06.083
than they've already been engaging in.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:10.143
Kaspersky was one
of the very first companies

00:11:10.167 --> 00:11:13.434
that said that they were going to start
taking this seriously.

00:11:13.458 --> 00:11:16.559
And in November of this year,

00:11:16.583 --> 00:11:18.643
they issued a report in which they said

00:11:18.667 --> 00:11:23.018
that since they started tracking
stalkerware among their users

00:11:23.042 --> 00:11:27.875
that they had seen
an increase of 35 percent.

00:11:29.708 --> 00:11:32.893
Likewise, Lookout came out
with a statement

00:11:32.917 --> 00:11:36.059
saying that they were going to take this
much more seriously.

00:11:36.083 --> 00:11:40.768
And finally, a company called Malwarebytes
also put out such a statement

00:11:40.792 --> 00:11:45.309
and said that they had found
2,500 programs

00:11:45.333 --> 00:11:47.226
in the time that they had been looking,

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.500
which could be classified as stalkerware.

00:11:50.875 --> 00:11:56.684
Finally, in November
I helped to launch a coalition

00:11:56.708 --> 00:11:59.768
called the Coalition Against Stalkerware,

00:11:59.792 --> 00:12:04.184
made up of academics,

00:12:04.208 --> 00:12:07.309
people who are doing
this sort of thing on the ground --

00:12:07.333 --> 00:12:13.643
the practitioners of helping people to
escape from intimate partner violence --

00:12:13.667 --> 00:12:16.059
and antivirus companies.

00:12:16.083 --> 00:12:21.726
And our goal is both to educate people
about these programs,

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.226
but also to convince
the antivirus companies

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:26.934
to change the norm

00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:32.268
in how they act around
this very scary software,

00:12:32.292 --> 00:12:35.018
so that soon, if I get up in front of you

00:12:35.042 --> 00:12:37.309
and I talk to you about this next year,

00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:40.143
I could tell you that the problem
has been solved,

00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:42.893
and all you have to do
is download any antivirus

00:12:42.917 --> 00:12:47.059
and it is considered normal
for it to detect stalkerware.

00:12:47.083 --> 00:12:48.893
That is my hope.

00:12:48.917 --> 00:12:50.226
Thank you very much.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:55.250
