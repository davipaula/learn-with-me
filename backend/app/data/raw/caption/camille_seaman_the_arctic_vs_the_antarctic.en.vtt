00:00:06.835 --> 00:00:07.905
On our planet,

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:09.608
we have two polar regions:

00:00:09.608 --> 00:00:11.370
the Arctic, whose name comes from

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.488
the Greek Arktikos, of the North,

00:00:13.488 --> 00:00:14.804
and the Antarctic

00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:16.160
from Antarktikos,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.726
opposite of the North.

00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:19.978
But there's an easier way to remember them

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:22.082
if you just remember what surrounds them.

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:25.749
The Arctic, situated in the Northern hemisphere of our planet,

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.003
is an ocean entirely surrounded by land.

00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:30.547
On the other side of the world,

00:00:30.547 --> 00:00:32.215
the Antarctic is a continent

00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:34.755
entirely surrounded by ocean.

00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:37.730
So, the Arctic has polar bears but no penguins,

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.713
and the Antarctic has penguins but no polar bears.

00:00:41.357 --> 00:00:43.551
Let's talk about the Arctic first.

00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:47.016
The Arctic region consists of a vast, ice-covered ocean

00:00:47.016 --> 00:00:49.627
surrounded by treeless permafrost.

00:00:49.627 --> 00:00:51.194
The area can be defined

00:00:51.194 --> 00:00:53.129
as the region between the Arctic Circle

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.586
and the North Pole.

00:00:54.586 --> 00:00:56.215
If you were to stand at the North Pole,

00:00:56.215 --> 00:00:58.836
everywhere you looked, in all directions,

00:00:58.836 --> 00:00:59.960
would be south.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.323
But standing at the North Pole

00:01:01.323 --> 00:01:03.255
is difficult to do for very long

00:01:03.255 --> 00:01:05.400
because it's in the middle of an ocean,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.420
covered by constantly shifting, frozen sea ice.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.169
If you were to fall into the water at the North Pole,

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:15.634
you'd fall into water that's 13,980 feet deep.

00:01:15.634 --> 00:01:18.174
Above the water, average winter temperatures

00:01:18.174 --> 00:01:21.593
can be as low as -40 degrees Celsius,

00:01:21.593 --> 00:01:23.349
and the coldest recorded temperature

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:27.930
is approximately -68 degrees Celsius.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.263
Despite these incredibly harsh conditions,

00:01:29.263 --> 00:01:31.575
humans have populated areas in the Arctic

00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:33.804
for thousands of years.

00:01:33.804 --> 00:01:37.483
Life in the Arctic includes organisms living in the ice,

00:01:37.483 --> 00:01:39.456
zooplankton and phytoplankton,

00:01:39.456 --> 00:01:41.041
fish and marine mammals,

00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:41.730
birds,

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.367
land animals,

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:42.985
plants,

00:01:42.985 --> 00:01:45.084
and human societies.

00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:47.183
Okay, what about Antarctica?

00:01:47.183 --> 00:01:50.224
Antarctica is Earth's southernmost continent,

00:01:50.224 --> 00:01:52.885
and it contains the geographic South Pole.

00:01:52.885 --> 00:01:55.588
It's the fifth largest continent on the planet

00:01:55.588 --> 00:01:57.836
at nearly twice the size of Australia.

00:01:57.836 --> 00:02:01.335
Almost 98% of Anarctica is covered by ice

00:02:01.335 --> 00:02:03.778
at least one mile in thickness.

00:02:03.778 --> 00:02:06.859
Conditions in Antarctica are some of the most extreme

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.305
in the entire world.

00:02:08.305 --> 00:02:10.157
On average, it's the coldest,

00:02:10.157 --> 00:02:10.974
windiest,

00:02:10.974 --> 00:02:12.352
driest continent

00:02:12.352 --> 00:02:14.183
and has the highest average elevation

00:02:14.183 --> 00:02:15.725
of all the continents.

00:02:15.725 --> 00:02:18.689
You might think that it snows all the time at the Poles,

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.526
but Antarctica is so dry,

00:02:20.526 --> 00:02:21.996
it's considered a desert

00:02:21.996 --> 00:02:23.111
with annual precipitation

00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:26.252
of only 200 millimeters along the coast

00:02:26.252 --> 00:02:27.614
and far less inland.

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:29.164
The temperature in Antarctica

00:02:29.164 --> 00:02:32.564
has reached -89 degrees Celsius.

00:02:32.564 --> 00:02:34.995
Because it's so harsh and hard to get to,

00:02:34.995 --> 00:02:37.969
there are no permanent human residents on Antarctica,

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.498
but anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people

00:02:40.498 --> 00:02:41.752
reside throughout the year

00:02:41.752 --> 00:02:44.916
at the research stations scattered across the continent.

00:02:44.916 --> 00:02:48.297
Even the most extreme animals fight for survival,

00:02:48.297 --> 00:02:51.100
and only cold-adapted organisms survive there,

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.092
including many types of algae,

00:02:53.092 --> 00:02:54.242
animals,

00:02:54.242 --> 00:02:55.331
bacteria,

00:02:55.331 --> 00:02:56.288
fungi,

00:02:56.288 --> 00:02:57.114
plants,

00:02:57.114 --> 00:02:58.080
and protista.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.850
But why is Antarctica colder than its northern cousin?

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.468
Well, first, much of the continent

00:03:04.468 --> 00:03:07.075
is more than three kilometers above sea level,

00:03:07.075 --> 00:03:09.431
and temperature decreases with elevation.

00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:12.058
That's why mountaintops have snow on them.

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:13.853
Second, remember that the Arctic

00:03:13.853 --> 00:03:16.306
is really a frozen ocean.

00:03:16.306 --> 00:03:17.847
The water in the ocean beneath it

00:03:17.847 --> 00:03:20.819
is warmer than the frozen ground in the Antarctic,

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.657
and that warmth is transferred through the ice pack.

00:03:23.657 --> 00:03:26.069
This prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.489
from reaching the extremes

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.686
typical of the land surface of Antarctica.

00:03:30.686 --> 00:03:34.573
Third, the seasons are conspiring against the Antarctic.

00:03:34.573 --> 00:03:36.616
During the aphelion in July,

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:38.736
when the Earth is the farthest away from the Sun,

00:03:38.736 --> 00:03:41.546
it also happens to be winter in the Antarctic,

00:03:41.546 --> 00:03:43.454
which creates a double-whammy of cold

00:03:43.454 --> 00:03:44.751
for the southern pole.

00:03:44.751 --> 00:03:46.906
But despite being inhospitable,

00:03:46.906 --> 00:03:49.327
the North and South Pole are a big reason

00:03:49.327 --> 00:03:51.431
why our planet is the way it is.

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:52.940
Both of our polar regions

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.158
are very important climate controllers.

00:03:55.158 --> 00:03:56.886
They help moderate the temperature

00:03:56.886 --> 00:03:58.654
in our temperate zones

00:03:58.654 --> 00:04:00.347
and give us stable weather.

00:04:00.347 --> 00:04:02.475
As sea ice in the Arctic declines

00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:04.558
due to climate change and global warming,

00:04:04.558 --> 00:04:05.908
weather around the globe

00:04:05.908 --> 00:04:08.234
becomes increasing more unstable.
