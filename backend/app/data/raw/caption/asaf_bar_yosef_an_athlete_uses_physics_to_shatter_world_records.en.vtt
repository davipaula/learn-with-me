00:00:06.954 --> 00:00:08.678
In the early 1960s,

00:00:08.678 --> 00:00:12.127
Dick Fosbury tried his hand at almost every sport,

00:00:12.127 --> 00:00:14.252
but never excelled at anything,

00:00:14.252 --> 00:00:17.964
until, at the age of 16, he turned to the high jump.

00:00:17.964 --> 00:00:19.799
But when he couldn't compete against

00:00:19.799 --> 00:00:21.846
the strong athletes at his college

00:00:21.846 --> 00:00:24.596
using the standard high jump techniques of the time,

00:00:24.596 --> 00:00:28.180
Fosbury tried to jump a different way: backwards.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.723
Instead of jumping with his face towards the bar,

00:00:30.723 --> 00:00:32.261
bringing each leg over in the

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:33.653
traditional straddle method,

00:00:33.653 --> 00:00:36.898
he jumped with his back towards the bar.

00:00:36.898 --> 00:00:40.512
Fosbury improved his record by over half a foot,

00:00:40.512 --> 00:00:42.197
and left his coaches amazed

00:00:42.197 --> 00:00:45.032
by this strange new style of high jumping.

00:00:45.032 --> 00:00:46.451
During the next few years,

00:00:46.451 --> 00:00:48.931
Fosbury perfected his high jump style,

00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:50.846
won the U.S. National trials,

00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:55.211
and assured his place in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico.

00:00:55.211 --> 00:00:57.763
In the Olympic Games, Fosbury amazed the world

00:00:57.763 --> 00:01:00.476
with his new technique, winning a gold metal

00:01:00.476 --> 00:01:04.344
with an Olympic record leap of 2.24 meters.

00:01:04.344 --> 00:01:05.659
By the next Olympic Games,

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.889
almost all of the competing of high jumpers

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:09.976
had adopted what came to be known as

00:01:09.976 --> 00:01:11.930
the Fosbury Flop.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.892
What's the secret behind the technique?

00:01:13.892 --> 00:01:15.645
It lies in a physics concept

00:01:15.645 --> 00:01:17.483
called the center of mass.

00:01:17.483 --> 00:01:18.788
For every object,

00:01:18.788 --> 00:01:21.762
we can locate the average position of all of its mass

00:01:21.762 --> 00:01:23.846
by taking into account how the mass

00:01:23.846 --> 00:01:26.033
is spread around the object.

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:27.974
For instance, the center of mass

00:01:27.974 --> 00:01:31.119
of a flat, rectangular object of uniform density

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.790
will be in the intersection of both diagonals,

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.028
in equal distance from each corner.

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:38.430
We can find the center of mass for other objects

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.085
by similar calculations,

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:42.678
or by finding the object's balancing point,

00:01:42.678 --> 00:01:45.717
which lies right underneath its center of mass.

00:01:45.717 --> 00:01:47.590
Try balancing a broom by holding it

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.931
and slowly bringing your hands together until they meet.

00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:53.394
This balancing point lies right underneath

00:01:53.394 --> 00:01:55.728
the broom's center of mass.

00:01:55.728 --> 00:01:57.930
We humans also have a center of mass.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.429
When most people stand up,

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.513
their center of mass is around the belly,

00:02:01.513 --> 00:02:03.097
but what happens to your center of mass

00:02:03.097 --> 00:02:04.945
when you lift your hands in the air?

00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:06.906
Your center of mass moves upwards.

00:02:06.906 --> 00:02:09.366
It moves all the time as you move through the day,

00:02:09.366 --> 00:02:11.526
based on how your body is positioned.

00:02:11.526 --> 00:02:13.538
It can even move outside of your body.

00:02:13.538 --> 00:02:15.957
When you bend forward, your center of mass

00:02:15.957 --> 00:02:18.251
is located below your bent belly

00:02:18.251 --> 00:02:20.295
in a place where there is no mass at all.

00:02:20.295 --> 00:02:23.048
Weird to think about, but that's the average position

00:02:23.048 --> 00:02:24.411
of all your mass.

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:25.865
Many objects' center of mass

00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:27.192
are outside their bodies.

00:02:27.192 --> 00:02:29.117
Think of doughnuts or boomerangs.

00:02:29.117 --> 00:02:32.528
Now look at the Fosbury Flop, and follow the position

00:02:32.528 --> 00:02:34.719
of the center of mass of the jumper.

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.491
The jumper runs very fast,

00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:38.679
so he can divert his horizontal velocity

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:41.316
to vertical velocity, and jumps.

00:02:41.316 --> 00:02:43.513
Wait for it...there.

00:02:43.513 --> 00:02:45.323
Look at the jumper's center of mass

00:02:45.323 --> 00:02:47.279
as his body bends backward.

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:48.781
It's below the bar.

00:02:48.781 --> 00:02:51.015
That is the secret behind the jump.

00:02:51.015 --> 00:02:53.493
With the old, pre-Fosbury techniques,

00:02:53.493 --> 00:02:55.539
the jumper had to apply enough force

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:58.096
to lift his center of mass above the bar

00:02:58.096 --> 00:03:00.458
by a few inches in order to clear it.

00:03:00.458 --> 00:03:03.263
The Fosbury Flopper doesn't have to do that.

00:03:03.263 --> 00:03:05.524
The genius of the Fosbury Flop is that the jumper

00:03:05.524 --> 00:03:07.763
can apply the same amount of force,

00:03:07.763 --> 00:03:10.555
but raise his body much higher than before.

00:03:10.555 --> 00:03:12.735
That means he can raise the bar so high

00:03:12.735 --> 00:03:14.565
that even when his center of mass

00:03:14.565 --> 00:03:18.331
can't go any higher, his arching body can.

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:19.642
Fosbury's technique brought

00:03:19.642 --> 00:03:21.231
the high jump to new heights

00:03:21.231 --> 00:03:22.733
by splitting the jumper's body

00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:24.345
away from his center of mass,

00:03:24.345 --> 00:03:26.099
giving it that much more room

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.513
to clear higher and higher bars.

00:03:28.513 --> 00:03:30.948
So the Fosbury Flop may be sports history's

00:03:30.948 --> 00:03:32.949
only great leap forward,

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:36.949
that is also a great leap backward.
