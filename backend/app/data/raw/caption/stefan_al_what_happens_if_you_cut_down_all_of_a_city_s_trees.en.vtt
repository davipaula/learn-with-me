00:00:07.484 --> 00:00:10.461
This is the tale of two ancient cities

00:00:10.461 --> 00:00:14.071
and the trees 
that determined their destinies.

00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:19.930
In 3,000 BC Uruk was more densely 
populated than modern day New York City.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.802
This crowded capital had to continually
expand their irrigation system

00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:26.902
to feed its growing population.

00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:33.784
2,500 years later in Sri Lanka, the city 
of Anuradhapura had a similar problem.

00:00:33.784 --> 00:00:36.246
They were also growing constantly,

00:00:36.246 --> 00:00:42.019
and like Uruk, their city relied heavily 
on an elaborate irrigation system.

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:48.290
As Uruk grew, its farmers began chopping 
down trees to make space for more crops.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.543
In Anuradhapura, however, 
trees were sacred.

00:00:51.543 --> 00:00:54.843
Their city housed an offshoot 
of the Bodhi tree

00:00:54.843 --> 00:00:59.112
under which Buddha himself 
was said to have attained enlightenment.

00:00:59.112 --> 00:01:02.212
Religious reverence 
slowed farmer’s axes

00:01:02.212 --> 00:01:06.947
and even led the city to plant 
additional trees in urban parks.

00:01:06.947 --> 00:01:10.146
Initially, Uruk’s expansion worked well.

00:01:10.146 --> 00:01:13.326
But without trees to filter 
their water supply,

00:01:13.326 --> 00:01:16.706
Uruk’s irrigation system 
became contaminated.

00:01:16.706 --> 00:01:19.556
Evaporating water left mineral deposits,

00:01:19.556 --> 00:01:23.080
which rendered the soil 
too salty for agriculture.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.390
Conversely, Anuradhapura’s 
irrigation system was designed to work

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.890
in concert with the surrounding forest.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.120
Their city eventually grew to more than 
twice Uruk’s population,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.773
and today, Anuradhapura still cares 
for a tree planted over 2,000 years ago.

00:01:40.773 --> 00:01:44.912
We may think of nature as being 
unconnected to our urban spaces,

00:01:44.912 --> 00:01:49.657
but trees have always been 
an essential part of successful cities.

00:01:49.657 --> 00:01:53.974
Trees act like a natural sponge, 
absorbing storm water runoff

00:01:53.974 --> 00:01:56.782
before releasing it back 
into the atmosphere.

00:01:56.782 --> 00:01:59.562
The webs of their roots protect against 
mudslides

00:01:59.562 --> 00:02:03.639
while allowing soil to retain water 
and filter out toxins.

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:05.669
Roots help prevent floods,

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:09.598
while reducing the need for storm 
drains and water treatment plants.

00:02:09.598 --> 00:02:14.761
Their porous leaves purify the air 
by trapping carbon and other pollutants,

00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:18.351
making them essential 
in the fight against climate change.

00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:23.026
Humanity has been uncovering 
these arboreal benefits for centuries.

00:02:23.026 --> 00:02:27.132
But trees aren’t just crucial 
to the health of a city’s infrastructure;

00:02:27.132 --> 00:02:30.602
they play a vital role in the health 
of its citizens as well.

00:02:30.602 --> 00:02:36.225
In the 1870’s, Manhattan had few trees 
outside the island’s parks.

00:02:36.225 --> 00:02:38.215
Without trees to provide shade,

00:02:38.215 --> 00:02:42.311
buildings absorbed up to nine times 
more solar radiation

00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:44.630
during deadly summer heat waves.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.780
Combined with the period’s 
poor sanitation standards,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.229
the oppressive heat made the city a 
breeding ground for bacteria like cholera.

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:57.943
In modern day Hong Kong, tall skyscrapers
and underground infrastructure

00:02:57.943 --> 00:03:00.343
make it difficult for trees to grow.

00:03:00.343 --> 00:03:04.223
This contributes to the city’s 
dangerously poor air quality,

00:03:04.223 --> 00:03:07.903
which can cause bronchitis 
and diminished lung function.

00:03:07.903 --> 00:03:10.213
Trees affect our mental health as well.

00:03:10.213 --> 00:03:15.492
Research indicates that the presence 
of green foliage increases attention spans

00:03:15.492 --> 00:03:17.910
and decreases stress levels.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.056
It’s even been shown that hospital 
patients with views of brick walls

00:03:22.056 --> 00:03:26.056
recover more slowly than 
those with views of trees.

00:03:26.056 --> 00:03:29.452
Fortunately, many cities 
are full of views like this—

00:03:29.452 --> 00:03:30.902
and that’s no accident.

00:03:30.902 --> 00:03:32.884
As early as the 18th century,

00:03:32.884 --> 00:03:37.619
city planners began to embrace 
the importance of urban trees.

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:43.290
In 1733, Colonel James Oglethorpe 
planned the city of Savannah, Georgia

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.241
to ensure that no neighborhood 
was more than a 2-minute walk from a park.

00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:53.879
After World War II, Copenhagen directed 
all new development along five arteries—

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.509
each sandwiched between a park.

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:58.849
This layout increased 
the city’s resilience

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.272
to pollution and natural disasters.

00:04:01.272 --> 00:04:04.262
And urban trees don’t just benefit people.

00:04:04.262 --> 00:04:08.421
Portland’s Forest Park preserves 
the region’s natural biodiversity,

00:04:08.421 --> 00:04:11.271
making the city home to various 
local plants,

00:04:11.271 --> 00:04:16.237
112 bird species, 
and 62 species of mammals.

00:04:16.237 --> 00:04:20.007
No city is more committed to trees 
than Singapore.

00:04:20.007 --> 00:04:26.353
Since 1967, Singapore’s government
has planted over 1.2 million trees,

00:04:26.353 --> 00:04:32.070
including those within 50-meter tall 
vertical gardens called supertrees.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.070
These structures sustain themselves 
and nearby conservatories

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.180
with solar energy and collected rainwater.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.129
Trees and vegetation currently cover 
over 50% of Singapore’s landmass,

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:46.259
reducing the need for air conditioning

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.409
and encouraging low-pollution 
transportation.

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:55.331
By 2050, it’s estimated that over 65% of
the world will be living in cities.

00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:58.968
City planners can lay an eco-friendly
foundation,

00:04:58.968 --> 00:05:02.068
but it’s up to the people who live 
in these urban forests

00:05:01.806 --> 00:05:04.940
to make them homes for more than humans.
