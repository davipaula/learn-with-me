00:00:08.163 --> 00:00:12.313
The evolutionary tango 
of animal genitalia.

00:00:12.313 --> 00:00:14.704
Can you guess what you're looking at?

00:00:14.704 --> 00:00:18.465
If you answered "duck vagina,"
you'd be right.

00:00:18.465 --> 00:00:22.115
Although the bird's outward appearance
may not strike you as especially odd,

00:00:22.115 --> 00:00:24.155
it uses this strange, intricate,

00:00:24.155 --> 00:00:28.150
cork-screw shaped contraption 
to reproduce.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.084
We see similarly unbelievable genitalia
in insects,

00:00:31.084 --> 00:00:32.005
mammals,

00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:32.883
reptiles,

00:00:32.883 --> 00:00:33.785
fish,

00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:34.583
spiders,

00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:36.576
and even snails.

00:00:36.576 --> 00:00:40.915
Apparently, no organs evolve
faster and into more variable shapes

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:44.055
than those involved in procreation.

00:00:44.055 --> 00:00:49.550
Superficially, it makes sense
because evolution works via reproduction.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.536
When an animal leaves more offspring,
its genes will spread.

00:00:53.536 --> 00:00:57.284
And since genitalia are an animal's tools
for reproduction,

00:00:57.284 --> 00:01:01.579
any improvement there 
will have immediate effect.

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.946
And yet, what's the point of having
such decorative nether regions?

00:01:05.946 --> 00:01:08.986
After all, the function 
of genitalia seems simple.

00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:11.107
A penis deposits a bit of sperm

00:01:11.107 --> 00:01:15.156
and a vagina receives it 
and delivers it to the egg.

00:01:15.156 --> 00:01:17.126
A pipette-like thingy on the male

00:01:17.126 --> 00:01:22.507
and a funnel-like gizmo on the female
should do just fine for any animal.

00:01:22.507 --> 00:01:25.686
And yet, that's not what we see.

00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:30.078
The penis of a chicken flea, for example,
looks nothing like a pipette,

00:01:30.078 --> 00:01:33.014
more like an exploded grandfather clock.

00:01:33.014 --> 00:01:35.647
And the vagina of a featherwing beetle

00:01:35.647 --> 00:01:39.387
resembles something you'd find
in a Dr. Seuss book.

00:01:39.387 --> 00:01:40.837
Throughout the animal kingdom,

00:01:40.837 --> 00:01:43.679
genitalia are very complex things,

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.049
much more complicated than seems
necessary for what they're meant to do.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.036
That's because genitalia do more than just
deposit and receive sperm.

00:01:53.036 --> 00:02:00.607
Many male animals also use the penis
as courtship device, like crane flies.

00:02:00.607 --> 00:02:02.587
In some South American species,

00:02:02.587 --> 00:02:05.668
males have a tiny washboard and scraper
on their penis,

00:02:05.668 --> 00:02:09.989
which produces a song that reverberates
throughout the female's body

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.828
when they mate.

00:02:11.828 --> 00:02:15.459
It's thought that if female crane flies
enjoy this unusual serenade,

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.876
they'll allow the male 
to father their offspring.

00:02:18.876 --> 00:02:22.718
This way, the genes of the most
musical penises spread,

00:02:22.718 --> 00:02:27.509
leading to rapid evolution
of insects' phalluses.

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:31.820
Similarly, some beetles have two little
drumsticks on either side of the penis.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.680
During mating, they'll rub, slap, or tap
the female with these.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.429
And some hoofed mammals,
like rams and bulls,

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:43.519
use a whip-like extension 
on the penis's left side

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.820
to create a sensation during mating.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.277
But how can females really choose
between males

00:02:50.277 --> 00:02:53.688
if she can only assess them after mating?

00:02:53.688 --> 00:02:57.978
This is where the power
of female adaptation comes into play.

00:02:57.978 --> 00:03:00.968
In fact, insemination is different
to conception,

00:03:00.968 --> 00:03:04.481
and the female genitalia exploit
this distinction.

00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:06.159
For instance, in some dung flies,

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:11.050
the vagina contains pockets
for separating sperm from different males

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.630
depending on how appealing they were.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.739
Males using their penises for courtship

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.610
and females controlling 
their own sperm management

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.855
are two reasons why genitalia evolve
into such complex shapes.

00:03:24.855 --> 00:03:25.971
But there are others

00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:30.370
because genitalia are also where
a sexual conflict is played out.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.031
A female's interests are best served if
she fertilizes her eggs

00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:36.860
with the sperm of the best fathers

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.901
and creates genetic variability amongst
her offspring.

00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:44.381
For a male, on the other hand,
this is bad news.

00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:47.524
For him, it would be best if a female
used his sperm

00:03:47.524 --> 00:03:51.334
to fertilize all of her eggs.

00:03:51.334 --> 00:03:55.514
So we see cycles of adaptation
in an evolutionary arms race

00:03:55.514 --> 00:03:57.975
to retain control.

00:03:57.975 --> 00:04:00.977
Black widow spiders 
have a disposable penis tip

00:04:00.977 --> 00:04:06.011
that breaks off inside the vagina
blocking the attempts of his rivals,

00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:09.522
and bed bug males bypass a female's
genitalia altogether

00:04:09.522 --> 00:04:16.762
using a syringe-like penis to inject
sperm cells directly into her belly.

00:04:16.762 --> 00:04:18.137
Not to be outdone,

00:04:18.137 --> 00:04:21.254
females have evolved 
their own countermeasures.

00:04:21.254 --> 00:04:22.772
In some bed bug species,

00:04:22.772 --> 00:04:26.002
the females have evolved an entirely
new set of genitalia

00:04:26.002 --> 00:04:30.914
on their right hand flanks
where the males usually pierce them.

00:04:30.914 --> 00:04:35.244
That allows them to maintain
the power to filter out unwanted sperm

00:04:35.244 --> 00:04:37.404
with their genitalia.

00:04:37.404 --> 00:04:40.698
And duck vaginas are shaped
like a clockwise spiral

00:04:40.698 --> 00:04:46.604
so that when the male inflates his long,
counterclockwise coiled penis into her,

00:04:46.604 --> 00:04:48.202
and she disapproves,

00:04:48.202 --> 00:04:51.364
all she needs to do 
is flex her vaginal muscles

00:04:51.364 --> 00:04:55.061
and the penis just flubs out.

00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:59.425
So, genitalia differs so much,
not just to fascinate us,

00:04:59.425 --> 00:05:01.334
but because in every species,

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:05.405
they're the result of 
a furious evolutionary tango of sex

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:08.375
that has been going on
for millions of years

00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:11.446
and will continue for millions 
of years to come.
