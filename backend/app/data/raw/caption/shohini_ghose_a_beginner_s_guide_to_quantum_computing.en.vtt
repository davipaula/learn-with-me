00:00:12.917 --> 00:00:14.238
Let's play a game.

00:00:14.825 --> 00:00:17.701
Imagine that you are in Las Vegas,

00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:19.076
in a casino,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.116
and you decide to play a game
on one of the casino's computers,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.726
just like you might play
solitaire or chess.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.670
The computer can make moves
in the game, just like a human player.

00:00:30.438 --> 00:00:32.138
This is a coin game.

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:35.787
It starts with a coin showing heads,

00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:37.612
and the computer will play first.

00:00:37.636 --> 00:00:40.492
It can choose to flip the coin or not,

00:00:40.516 --> 00:00:42.325
but you don't get to see the outcome.

00:00:43.144 --> 00:00:44.325
Next, it's your turn.

00:00:44.862 --> 00:00:47.704
You can also choose
to flip the coin or not,

00:00:47.728 --> 00:00:51.188
and your move will not be revealed
to your opponent, the computer.

00:00:51.737 --> 00:00:55.736
Finally, the computer plays again,
and can flip the coin or not,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.451
and after these three rounds,

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.404
the coin is revealed,

00:01:00.428 --> 00:01:03.236
and if it is heads, the computer wins,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.975
if it's tails, you win.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.923
So it's a pretty simple game,

00:01:07.947 --> 00:01:11.340
and if everybody plays honestly,
and the coin is fair,

00:01:11.364 --> 00:01:15.126
then you have a 50 percent chance
of winning this game.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.424
And to confirm that,

00:01:17.448 --> 00:01:20.583
I asked my students to play
this game on our computers,

00:01:20.607 --> 00:01:22.591
and after many, many tries,

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:26.655
their winning rate ended up
being 50 percent, or close to 50 percent,

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.330
as expected.

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:30.390
Sounds like a boring game, right?

00:01:30.414 --> 00:01:33.631
But what if you could play this game
on a quantum computer?

00:01:34.665 --> 00:01:37.745
Now, Las Vegas casinos
do not have quantum computers,

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:39.510
as far as I know,

00:01:39.534 --> 00:01:42.970
but IBM has built
a working quantum computer.

00:01:42.994 --> 00:01:44.191
Here it is.

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:46.089
But what is a quantum computer?

00:01:46.534 --> 00:01:49.343
Well, quantum physics describes

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:53.137
the behavior of atoms
and fundamental particles,

00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:55.644
like electrons and photons.

00:01:55.668 --> 00:01:57.392
So a quantum computer operates

00:01:57.416 --> 00:02:00.023
by controlling the behavior
of these particles,

00:02:00.047 --> 00:02:03.713
but in a way that is completely different
from our regular computers.

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:08.175
So a quantum computer
is not just a more powerful version

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.304
of our current computers,

00:02:10.328 --> 00:02:14.335
just like a light bulb
is not a more powerful candle.

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.478
You cannot build a light bulb
by building better and better candles.

00:02:19.048 --> 00:02:21.263
A light bulb is a different technology,

00:02:21.287 --> 00:02:23.941
based on deeper scientific understanding.

00:02:23.965 --> 00:02:27.702
Similarly, a quantum computer
is a new kind of device,

00:02:27.726 --> 00:02:30.475
based on the science of quantum physics,

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:33.649
and just like a light bulb
transformed society,

00:02:33.673 --> 00:02:36.333
quantum computers
have the potential to impact

00:02:36.357 --> 00:02:38.234
so many aspects of our lives,

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:42.186
including our security needs,
our health care and even the internet.

00:02:42.837 --> 00:02:47.138
So companies all around the world
are working to build these devices,

00:02:47.162 --> 00:02:49.497
and to see what
the excitement is all about,

00:02:49.521 --> 00:02:51.671
let's play our game on a quantum computer.

00:02:52.862 --> 00:02:57.635
So I can log into IBM's
quantum computer from right here,

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.134
which means I can play the game remotely,

00:03:00.158 --> 00:03:01.308
and so can you.

00:03:02.151 --> 00:03:07.573
To make this happen, you may remember
getting an email ahead of time, from TED,

00:03:07.597 --> 00:03:11.322
asking you whether you would choose
to flip the coin or not,

00:03:11.346 --> 00:03:13.041
if you played the game.

00:03:13.065 --> 00:03:17.933
Well, actually, we asked you to choose
between a circle or a square.

00:03:17.957 --> 00:03:21.799
You didn't know it, but your choice
of circle meant "flip the coin,"

00:03:21.823 --> 00:03:23.980
and your choice of square
was "don't flip."

00:03:24.723 --> 00:03:27.564
We received 372 responses.

00:03:27.588 --> 00:03:28.778
Thank you.

00:03:28.802 --> 00:03:33.270
That means we can play 372 games
against the quantum computer

00:03:33.294 --> 00:03:34.922
using your choices.

00:03:34.946 --> 00:03:37.191
And it's a pretty fast game to play,

00:03:37.215 --> 00:03:39.422
so I can show you the results right here.

00:03:40.231 --> 00:03:42.537
Unfortunately, you didn't do very well.

00:03:42.561 --> 00:03:44.634
(Laughter)

00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:47.714
The quantum computer won
almost every game.

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:51.881
It lost a few only because
of operational errors in the computer.

00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:53.867
(Laughter)

00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:57.192
So how did it achieve
this amazing winning streak?

00:03:58.224 --> 00:04:00.717
It seems like magic or cheating,

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:03.119
but actually, it's just
quantum physics in action.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.356
Here's how it works.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.832
A regular computer simulates
heads or tails of a coin as a bit,

00:04:10.856 --> 00:04:12.511
a zero or a one,

00:04:12.535 --> 00:04:16.415
or a current flipping on and off
inside your computer chip.

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:18.519
A quantum computer
is completely different.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.763
A quantum bit has a more fluid,
nonbinary identity.

00:04:24.511 --> 00:04:30.353
It can exist in a superposition,
or a combination of zero and one,

00:04:30.377 --> 00:04:35.083
with some probability of being zero
and some probability of being one.

00:04:35.545 --> 00:04:38.076
In other words,
its identity is on a spectrum.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.593
For example, it could have
a 70 percent chance of being zero

00:04:42.617 --> 00:04:44.953
and a 30 percent chance of being one

00:04:44.977 --> 00:04:48.992
or 80-20 or 60-40.

00:04:49.016 --> 00:04:51.629
The possibilities are endless.

00:04:51.653 --> 00:04:53.019
The key idea here

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:57.263
is that we have to give up
on precise values of zero and one

00:04:57.287 --> 00:04:59.128
and allow for some uncertainty.

00:04:59.737 --> 00:05:01.388
So during the game,

00:05:01.412 --> 00:05:06.159
the quantum computer creates
this fluid combination of heads and tails,

00:05:06.183 --> 00:05:07.334
zero and one,

00:05:07.358 --> 00:05:09.626
so that no matter what the player does,

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.838
flip or no flip,

00:05:10.862 --> 00:05:13.238
the superposition remains intact.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.306
It's kind of like stirring
a mixture of two fluids.

00:05:17.714 --> 00:05:22.099
Whether or not you stir,
the fluids remain in a mixture,

00:05:22.123 --> 00:05:24.544
but in its final move,

00:05:24.568 --> 00:05:28.508
the quantum computer
can unmix the zero and one,

00:05:28.532 --> 00:05:32.270
perfectly recovering heads
so that you lose every time.

00:05:32.294 --> 00:05:33.864
(Laughter)

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:37.647
If you think this is all a bit weird,
you are absolutely right.

00:05:38.608 --> 00:05:42.687
Regular coins do not exist
in combinations of heads and tails.

00:05:43.056 --> 00:05:47.260
We do not experience
this fluid quantum reality

00:05:47.284 --> 00:05:48.754
in our everyday lives.

00:05:49.247 --> 00:05:51.501
So if you are confused by quantum,

00:05:51.525 --> 00:05:53.431
don't worry, you're getting it.

00:05:53.455 --> 00:05:56.619
(Laughter)

00:05:56.643 --> 00:06:00.899
But even though we don't experience
quantum strangeness,

00:06:00.923 --> 00:06:04.081
we can see its very real
effects in action.

00:06:04.105 --> 00:06:05.859
You've seen the data for yourself.

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:07.990
The quantum computer won

00:06:08.014 --> 00:06:12.802
because it harnessed
superposition and uncertainty,

00:06:12.826 --> 00:06:15.182
and these quantum properties are powerful,

00:06:15.206 --> 00:06:17.484
not just to win coin games,

00:06:17.508 --> 00:06:21.126
but also to build
future quantum technologies.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.666
So let me give you three examples
of potential applications

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.150
that could change our lives.

00:06:27.147 --> 00:06:32.448
First of all, quantum uncertainty
could be used to create private keys

00:06:32.472 --> 00:06:36.262
for encrypting messages
sent from one location to another

00:06:36.286 --> 00:06:41.415
so that hackers could not
secretly copy the key perfectly,

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:42.992
because of quantum uncertainty.

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:47.595
They would have to break
the laws of quantum physics

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:48.888
to hack the key.

00:06:49.531 --> 00:06:54.405
So this kind of unbreakable encryption
is already being tested by banks

00:06:54.429 --> 00:06:56.364
and other institutions worldwide.

00:06:57.357 --> 00:07:02.806
Today, we use more than 17 billion
connected devices globally.

00:07:03.619 --> 00:07:07.119
Just imagine the impact quantum encryption
could have in the future.

00:07:08.171 --> 00:07:13.901
Secondly, quantum technologies could also
transform health care and medicine.

00:07:14.427 --> 00:07:19.728
For example, the design and analysis
of molecules for drug development

00:07:19.752 --> 00:07:22.147
is a challenging problem today,

00:07:22.171 --> 00:07:27.123
and that's because
exactly describing and calculating

00:07:27.147 --> 00:07:31.249
all of the quantum properties
of all the atoms in the molecule

00:07:31.273 --> 00:07:34.924
is a computationally difficult task,
even for our supercomputers.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.686
But a quantum computer could do better,

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.964
because it operates using
the same quantum properties

00:07:40.988 --> 00:07:43.540
as the molecule it's trying to simulate.

00:07:43.564 --> 00:07:48.341
So future large-scale quantum
simulations for drug development

00:07:48.365 --> 00:07:51.651
could perhaps lead to treatments
for diseases like Alzheimer's,

00:07:51.675 --> 00:07:53.817
which affects thousands of lives.

00:07:54.355 --> 00:07:57.392
And thirdly, my favorite
quantum application

00:07:57.416 --> 00:08:02.075
is teleportation of information
from one location to another

00:08:02.099 --> 00:08:05.141
without physically transmitting
the information.

00:08:05.847 --> 00:08:09.276
Sounds like sci-fi, but it is possible,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.019
because these fluid identities
of the quantum particles

00:08:13.043 --> 00:08:16.401
can get entangled across space and time

00:08:16.425 --> 00:08:20.035
in such a way that when you change
something about one particle,

00:08:20.059 --> 00:08:21.515
it can impact the other,

00:08:21.539 --> 00:08:24.197
and that creates
a channel for teleportation.

00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:27.648
It's already been demonstrated
in research labs

00:08:27.672 --> 00:08:30.593
and could be part
of a future quantum internet.

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:34.566
We don't have such a network as yet,

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.494
but my team is working
on these possibilities,

00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:41.367
by simulating a quantum network
on a quantum computer.

00:08:42.052 --> 00:08:46.050
So we have designed and implemented
some interesting new protocols

00:08:46.074 --> 00:08:51.756
such as teleportation
among different users in the network

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.002
and efficient data transmission

00:08:54.026 --> 00:08:55.629
and even secure voting.

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:59.381
So it's a lot of fun for me,
being a quantum physicist.

00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:00.898
I highly recommend it.

00:09:00.922 --> 00:09:02.880
(Laughter)

00:09:02.904 --> 00:09:05.785
We get to be explorers
in a quantum wonderland.

00:09:05.809 --> 00:09:08.693
Who knows what applications
we will discover next.

00:09:09.222 --> 00:09:12.047
We must tread carefully and responsibly

00:09:12.071 --> 00:09:14.007
as we build our quantum future.

00:09:14.809 --> 00:09:16.607
And for me, personally,

00:09:16.631 --> 00:09:22.100
I don't see quantum physics as a tool
just to build quantum computers.

00:09:22.124 --> 00:09:27.258
I see quantum computers as a way
for us to probe the mysteries of nature

00:09:27.282 --> 00:09:31.194
and reveal more about this hidden world
outside of our experiences.

00:09:31.218 --> 00:09:33.320
How amazing that we humans,

00:09:33.344 --> 00:09:36.336
with our relatively limited
access to the universe,

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.994
can still see far beyond our horizons

00:09:39.018 --> 00:09:41.598
just using our imagination
and our ingenuity.

00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:44.528
And the universe rewards us

00:09:44.552 --> 00:09:48.480
by showing us how incredibly
interesting and surprising it is.

00:09:49.171 --> 00:09:52.547
The future is fundamentally uncertain,

00:09:52.571 --> 00:09:55.750
and to me, that is certainly exciting.

00:09:56.344 --> 00:09:57.495
Thank you.

00:09:57.519 --> 00:10:03.626
(Applause)
