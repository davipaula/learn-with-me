00:00:13.208 --> 00:00:18.643
I guess all of you have
a smartphone or an iPhone,

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:22.643
and this morning, probably
you checked on the weather,

00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:26.476
if its going to be rainy
to carry your umbrella,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.643
if it is going to be sunny
to use your sunglasses,

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:32.875
or if it is going to be cold
to have an extra coat.

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:39.893
It's going to give you, sometime,
good information and sometime not.

00:00:39.917 --> 00:00:42.143
Let me tell you,

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:45.934
my best app is my grandmother.

00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.875
(Laughter)

00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:51.184
She's called Mamadda.

00:00:51.208 --> 00:00:55.309
She can tell you not only today's weather

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:58.309
but she can predict the next 12 months,

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:03.184
if it's going to be
a good rain season or not.

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:07.059
She can tell you just
by observing her environment,

00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:09.851
by observing the wind direction,

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:11.559
the cloud position,

00:01:11.583 --> 00:01:13.476
the bird migration,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.434
the size of fruits,

00:01:15.458 --> 00:01:17.268
the plant flowers.

00:01:17.292 --> 00:01:23.000
She can tell you by observing
the behavior of her own cattle.

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:28.393
That's how she knows better
the weather and the ecosystem

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:30.042
that she's living in.

00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:35.518
I'm coming from a pastoralist community

00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:37.351
who are cattle herders.

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:39.434
We are nomadic.

00:01:39.458 --> 00:01:42.268
We move from one place to another one

00:01:42.292 --> 00:01:44.434
to find water and pasture.

00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:50.500
We can move up to a thousand kilometers,
the size of California, within one year.

00:01:51.792 --> 00:01:57.542
And this life helps us to live
in harmony with our ecosystem.

00:01:58.583 --> 00:02:00.250
We understand each other.

00:02:01.208 --> 00:02:04.643
For us, the nature is our supermarket,

00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:06.559
where we can collect our food,

00:02:06.583 --> 00:02:07.851
our water.

00:02:07.875 --> 00:02:12.143
It's our pharmacy where we can
collect our medicinal plants.

00:02:12.167 --> 00:02:13.643
But it's our school,

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:17.476
where we can learn better
how to protect it

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.542
and how it can give us back what we need.

00:02:22.333 --> 00:02:24.375
But with the climate change impact,

00:02:25.542 --> 00:02:29.958
we are experiencing a different impact.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.500
In my community,

00:02:35.208 --> 00:02:40.434
we have one of the top five
fresh waters in Africa.

00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:42.333
It's Lake Chad.

00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:45.768
When my mother was born,

00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:52.768
Lake Chad used to be
about 25,000 kilometers square of water.

00:02:52.792 --> 00:02:59.018
When I was born, 30 years ago,
it was 10,000 kilometers square.

00:02:59.042 --> 00:03:01.601
And actually now,

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:06.518
it's about 1,200 kilometers
square of water.

00:03:06.542 --> 00:03:11.625
Ninety percent of this water
just evaporated, disappeared.

00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:16.101
And you have more than 40 million people

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:20.184
living around this lake
and depending on it.

00:03:20.208 --> 00:03:21.601
They are pastoralists.

00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:23.309
They are fishermen.

00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:25.643
And they are farmers.

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:29.184
They do not depend on
the end of the month's salary.

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:31.434
They depend on the rainfall.

00:03:31.458 --> 00:03:34.184
They depend on the crops that are growing

00:03:34.208 --> 00:03:37.000
or the pasture for their cattle.

00:03:38.583 --> 00:03:40.934
The shrinking resources,

00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:46.351
you have many communities
that are fighting to get access.

00:03:46.375 --> 00:03:48.684
The first come is the first served.

00:03:48.708 --> 00:03:52.750
The second have to fight unto death.

00:03:54.708 --> 00:03:59.768
So climate change
is impacting our environment

00:03:59.792 --> 00:04:02.625
by changing our social life,

00:04:04.167 --> 00:04:10.184
because the role of man and woman
in this region, it's different.

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:13.601
Man is supposed to feed his family,

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:16.143
take care of his community,

00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:18.125
and if he cannot do that,

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.292
his dignity is under threat.

00:04:24.708 --> 00:04:28.417
He cannot do anything else to pay it back.

00:04:29.958 --> 00:04:35.601
So climate change takes our men
far away from us.

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:37.417
That is the migration.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.018
They can migrate to a big city
where they can stay for six or 12 months,

00:04:44.042 --> 00:04:48.125
where they get a job,
they can send back money.

00:04:49.042 --> 00:04:50.351
If they didn't get it,

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:52.934
they have to jump into the Mediterranean

00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.601
and migrate to Europe.

00:04:55.625 --> 00:05:00.208
Some of them die there,
but none of them stop going.

00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:05.434
Of course, it's sad
for the hosting country,

00:05:05.458 --> 00:05:06.792
who are developed countries,

00:05:08.167 --> 00:05:10.958
who have to adapt
to host the migrants coming.

00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:16.143
But how about those who are left behind,

00:05:16.167 --> 00:05:20.726
the women and the children
who have to play the role of men,

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.018
the role of women,

00:05:22.042 --> 00:05:23.934
who have to take care of the security,

00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:27.726
of the food, of the health
of the entire family,

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.625
children and old people?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.583
So those women for me, they are my heroes,

00:05:37.667 --> 00:05:41.750
because they are innovators,
they are solution makers,

00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:45.684
they are changing
the little of the resources

00:05:45.708 --> 00:05:48.851
into the big for the community.

00:05:48.875 --> 00:05:50.833
So those are my people.

00:05:52.458 --> 00:05:57.851
So we use our indigenous people's
traditional knowledge

00:05:57.875 --> 00:06:03.417
to get better resilience
to what we need to survive.

00:06:05.208 --> 00:06:08.684
Our knowledge is not only
for our communities.

00:06:08.708 --> 00:06:14.184
It's to share with each
and others who are living with us.

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:16.893
And indigenous peoples around the world

00:06:16.917 --> 00:06:20.792
are saving 80 percent
of the world's biodiversity.

00:06:22.292 --> 00:06:24.107
That's the scientists who say that.

00:06:25.917 --> 00:06:27.958
Indigenous peoples in the Amazon,

00:06:29.292 --> 00:06:34.875
you can find the most diverse ecosystem,
better than the national park.

00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:39.184
The indigenous peoples from the Pacific,

00:06:39.208 --> 00:06:42.309
the grandma and the grandpa,

00:06:42.333 --> 00:06:47.542
they know where to get food
after the hurricane hits them.

00:06:49.417 --> 00:06:52.893
So the knowledge that our peoples know

00:06:52.917 --> 00:06:56.934
is helping us to survive and helping
other peoples also to survive

00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.851
the climate change impact.

00:06:58.875 --> 00:07:00.643
The world is losing.

00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:05.684
We lost already 60 percent of the species,

00:07:05.708 --> 00:07:08.125
and it's increasing every day.

00:07:09.208 --> 00:07:14.101
So one day, I took a scientist
to my community.

00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:19.500
I said, you are giving the good weather
information through the TV and radio,

00:07:20.875 --> 00:07:23.393
but how about coming to my people?

00:07:23.417 --> 00:07:24.667
And then they come,

00:07:26.042 --> 00:07:27.559
they sit around,

00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:32.351
and suddenly, as we are nomadic,
we just start packing our stuff,

00:07:32.375 --> 00:07:34.601
and then they say, like, "Are we moving?"

00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:37.934
I'm like, "No, we are not moving.
It's going to rain."

00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.643
And they're like, "Oh, there's no cloud.
How do you know it's going to rain?"

00:07:41.667 --> 00:07:45.059
We're like, "Yeah, it's going to rain."
We pack our stuff.

00:07:45.083 --> 00:07:49.434
Suddenly, heavy rain starts coming,

00:07:49.458 --> 00:07:53.184
and we are seeing the scientist
running around, hiding under trees

00:07:53.208 --> 00:07:54.726
and protecting their stuff.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.268
We already packed ours.

00:07:56.292 --> 00:07:57.792
(Laughter)

00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:03.101
After the end of the rain,
the serious discussion starts.

00:08:03.125 --> 00:08:06.042
They say, "How do you know
that it's going to rain?"

00:08:06.792 --> 00:08:11.393
We say, "Well, the old woman
observed the insects

00:08:11.417 --> 00:08:13.976
taking the eggs inside their homes,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.351
and while the insect
cannot talk or watch TV,

00:08:18.375 --> 00:08:22.559
they know how to predict
to protect their generations,

00:08:22.583 --> 00:08:24.601
how to protect their food.

00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:28.059
So for us it's the sign
that it's going to rain

00:08:28.083 --> 00:08:30.726
in at maximum a couple of hours."

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.226
And then they say,

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:35.393
well, we do have knowledge,

00:08:35.417 --> 00:08:40.708
but we do not combine ecological knowledge
and weather knowledge all together.

00:08:41.833 --> 00:08:44.768
So that's how I started working

00:08:44.792 --> 00:08:49.726
with meteorological scientists
and my communities

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:54.458
to give better information
to get peoples adapted to climate change.

00:08:57.042 --> 00:09:03.268
I think, if we put together
all the knowledge systems that we have --

00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:06.101
science, technology,

00:09:06.125 --> 00:09:08.018
traditional knowledge --

00:09:08.042 --> 00:09:13.184
we can give the best of us
to protect our peoples,

00:09:13.208 --> 00:09:15.101
to protect our planet,

00:09:15.125 --> 00:09:18.125
to restore the ecosystem
that we are losing.

00:09:19.042 --> 00:09:20.958
I did that in another way, also.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.601
I used a tool that I really love a lot.

00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:29.809
It's called a 3D participatory mapping:

00:09:29.833 --> 00:09:35.268
participatory, because it can bring
women, men,

00:09:35.292 --> 00:09:37.476
youth, elders,

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.684
all the intergenerational peoples.

00:09:40.708 --> 00:09:44.059
Then they use science-based knowledge,

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:47.309
and the community comes together,
they build this map,

00:09:47.333 --> 00:09:50.143
they figure out all
the knowledge that we have

00:09:50.167 --> 00:09:53.976
about where is our sacred forest,
where is our water point,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.518
where is our corridor,

00:09:55.542 --> 00:09:59.875
where is the place that we move
during each season.

00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:06.434
And these tools are amazing,
because it's building capacity of women,

00:10:06.458 --> 00:10:08.976
because in our communities

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.143
women and men cannot sit together.

00:10:11.167 --> 00:10:14.893
Men talk always, women just sitting there,

00:10:14.917 --> 00:10:16.184
but in the back.

00:10:16.208 --> 00:10:18.143
They are not there to take any decision.

00:10:18.167 --> 00:10:21.893
So after the men figure out
all the knowledge,

00:10:21.917 --> 00:10:25.226
we say, well, you call the women,
"Come and have a look."

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.559
They say, "Yes, sure,"

00:10:26.583 --> 00:10:28.681
because they've already done 
the first work.

00:10:28.685 --> 00:10:29.976
(Laughter)

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.768
When the women come,

00:10:31.792 --> 00:10:34.518
and they look at the map,
they're like, "Mm, no."

00:10:34.542 --> 00:10:36.018
(Laughter)

00:10:36.042 --> 00:10:37.309
"This is wrong.

00:10:37.333 --> 00:10:40.601
Here's where I collect the medicine.
Here's where I collect the food.

00:10:40.625 --> 00:10:42.226
Here's where I collect --"

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.684
So we changed the knowledge in the map,

00:10:44.708 --> 00:10:46.375
and we called the men.

00:10:47.208 --> 00:10:49.393
Well, they think about what women said.

00:10:49.417 --> 00:10:51.018
All of them shaking their heads.

00:10:51.042 --> 00:10:53.393
"They are right. They are right.

00:10:53.417 --> 00:10:54.809
They are right."

00:10:54.833 --> 00:10:58.434
So that's how we build
the capacity of the women

00:10:58.458 --> 00:10:59.893
in giving them a voice

00:10:59.917 --> 00:11:02.059
in this 3D participatory mapping,

00:11:02.083 --> 00:11:04.268
so women get the detailed knowledge

00:11:04.292 --> 00:11:07.059
that can help the community to adapt.

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:10.101
And man have the bigger picture knowledge.

00:11:10.125 --> 00:11:12.684
So when we put it together,

00:11:12.708 --> 00:11:17.018
this map helps them to discuss

00:11:17.042 --> 00:11:20.226
but to mitigate the conflict
between the communities

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.018
to access the resources,

00:11:22.042 --> 00:11:23.976
to share better these resources,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.417
to restore it

00:11:26.833 --> 00:11:29.333
and to manage it for the long term.

00:11:31.833 --> 00:11:34.726
Our knowledge is very useful.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.934
Indigenous peoples' knowledge

00:11:36.958 --> 00:11:40.976
are very crucial for our planet.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.917
It's crucial for all the peoples.

00:11:46.042 --> 00:11:51.851
Science knowledge
was discovered 200 years ago,

00:11:51.875 --> 00:11:54.309
technology 100 years ago,

00:11:54.333 --> 00:11:58.750
but indigenous peoples' knowledge,
it's thousands of years ago.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:03.143
So why we cannot put
all of these together,

00:12:03.167 --> 00:12:06.143
combine those three knowledges

00:12:06.167 --> 00:12:07.768
and give the better resilience

00:12:07.792 --> 00:12:13.643
to the peoples who are getting
the impact of climate change?

00:12:13.667 --> 00:12:16.393
And now it's not only
the developing countries.

00:12:16.417 --> 00:12:18.101
It's the developed countries also.

00:12:18.125 --> 00:12:21.934
We saw the hurricane.
We saw the flood around all the places.

00:12:21.958 --> 00:12:25.351
We saw the fire, even here in California.

00:12:25.375 --> 00:12:27.893
So we need all this knowledge
to come together.

00:12:27.917 --> 00:12:30.226
We need the people in the center.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.768
And we need the decision makers to change,

00:12:32.792 --> 00:12:34.208
scientists tell them,

00:12:35.417 --> 00:12:37.268
and we tell them,

00:12:37.292 --> 00:12:39.809
and we do have this knowledge.

00:12:39.833 --> 00:12:43.083
We have 10 years to change it.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:45.601
Ten years is nothing,

00:12:45.625 --> 00:12:48.143
so we need to act all together

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:50.809
and we need to act right now.

00:12:50.833 --> 00:12:52.351
Thank you.

00:12:52.375 --> 00:12:56.167
(Applause)
