00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.788
(Singing) I see the moon.
The moon sees me.

00:00:20.788 --> 00:00:26.858
The moon sees somebody that I don't see.

00:00:26.858 --> 00:00:33.393
God bless the moon, and god bless me,

00:00:33.393 --> 00:00:40.368
and God bless that somebody
that I don't see.

00:00:40.368 --> 00:00:46.050
If I get to heaven, before you do,

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.891
I'll make a hole and pull you through.

00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:57.782
And I'll write your name, on every star,

00:00:57.782 --> 00:01:02.005
and that way the world,

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:05.887
won't seem so far.

00:01:05.887 --> 00:01:09.602
The astronaut will not be at work today.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.497
He has called in sick.

00:01:11.497 --> 00:01:16.887
He has turned off his cell phone,
his laptop, his pager, his alarm clock.

00:01:16.887 --> 00:01:19.846
There is a fat yellow cat
asleep on his couch,

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:21.799
rain drops against the window,

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.014
and not even the hint
of coffee in the kitchen air.

00:01:25.014 --> 00:01:26.768
Everybody is in a tizzy.

00:01:26.768 --> 00:01:30.708
The engineers on the 15th floor have
stopped working on their particle machine.

00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:32.711
The anti gravity room is leaking

00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:34.619
and even the freckled kid with glasses,

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.135
whose only job is to take
out the trash, is nervous,

00:01:37.135 --> 00:01:39.777
fumbles the bag, spills
a banana peel and a paper cup.

00:01:39.777 --> 00:01:41.383
Nobody notices.

00:01:41.383 --> 00:01:44.479
They are too busy recalculating
what this all mean for lost time.

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:46.866
How many galaxies
are we losing per second.

00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:49.486
How long before next rocket
can be launched, somewhere.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.743
An electron flies off its energy cloud.

00:01:51.743 --> 00:01:53.024
A black hole has erupted.

00:01:53.024 --> 00:01:56.216
A mother finishes setting
the table for dinner.

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:57.883
A Law &amp; Order marathon is starting.

00:01:57.907 --> 00:02:00.037
The astronaut is asleep.

00:02:00.037 --> 00:02:01.959
He has forgotten to turn off his watch,

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:04.759
which ticks, like a metal
pulse against his wrist.

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.510
He does not hear it.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.673
He dreams of coral reefs and plankton.

00:02:09.673 --> 00:02:12.675
His fingers find
the pillowcase's sailing masts.

00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:15.399
He turns on his side.
Opens his eyes at once.

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:20.668
He thinks that scuba divers must have
the most wonderful job in the world.

00:02:20.668 --> 00:02:24.335
So much water to glide through!

00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:30.687
(Applause)

00:02:30.687 --> 00:02:32.879
Thank you.

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.004
When I was little, I could
not understand the concept

00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:39.771
that you could only live one life.

00:02:39.771 --> 00:02:41.637
I don't mean this metaphorically.

00:02:41.637 --> 00:02:44.966
I mean, I literally thought
that I was going to get to do

00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:47.512
everything that there was to do

00:02:47.512 --> 00:02:50.027
and be everything there was to be.

00:02:50.027 --> 00:02:51.899
It was only a matter of time.

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:54.709
Ad there was no limitation
based on age, or gender,

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.659
or race or even appropriate time period.

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.009
I was sure that I was going
to actually experience

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:05.523
what it felt like to be a leader
of the civil right movement,

00:03:05.523 --> 00:03:08.441
or a ten-year old boy living
on a farm during the dust bowl,

00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:12.086
or an emperor of the Tang
dynasty in China.

00:03:12.086 --> 00:03:14.739
My mom says that when people asked me what

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.140
I wanted to be when I grew up, my typical
response was princess-ballerina-astronaut.

00:03:20.164 --> 00:03:23.293
And what she doesn't understand
is that I wasn't trying to invent

00:03:23.318 --> 00:03:25.441
some combined
super profession.

00:03:25.442 --> 00:03:28.869
I was listing things I thought
I was gonna get to be:

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:31.953
a princess, and a ballerina,
and an astronaut.

00:03:31.953 --> 00:03:34.668
and I'm pretty sure the list
probably went on from there.

00:03:34.692 --> 00:03:36.592
I usually just got cut off.

00:03:36.592 --> 00:03:39.359
It was never a question
of if I was going to do something

00:03:39.384 --> 00:03:41.875
so much of a question of when.

00:03:41.876 --> 00:03:44.700
And I was sure that if I was going
to do everything,

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.208
that it probably meant I had
to move pretty quickly,

00:03:47.208 --> 00:03:49.458
because there was a lot
of stuff I needed to do.

00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:51.808
So my life was constantly
in a state of rushing.

00:03:51.808 --> 00:03:53.999
I was always scared
that I was falling behind.

00:03:54.023 --> 00:03:56.940
And since I grew up in New York
City, as far as I could tell,

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.112
rushing was pretty normal.

00:04:00.112 --> 00:04:03.926
But, as I grew up, I had
this sinking realization,

00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:08.021
that I wasn't gonna get to live
any more than one life

00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:11.016
I only knew what it felt
like to be a teenage girl

00:04:11.016 --> 00:04:12.046
in New York City,

00:04:12.046 --> 00:04:14.934
not a teenage boy in New Zealand,

00:04:14.934 --> 00:04:17.821
not a prom queen in Kansas.

00:04:17.821 --> 00:04:21.012
I only got to see through my lens
and it was around this time

00:04:21.012 --> 00:04:23.089
that I became obsessed with stories,

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:25.613
because it was through stories
that I was able to see

00:04:25.637 --> 00:04:30.021
through someone else's lens,
however briefly or imperfectly.

00:04:30.021 --> 00:04:33.849
And I started craving hearing
other people's experiences

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:37.052
because I was so jealous
that there were entire lives

00:04:37.052 --> 00:04:39.906
that I was never going to get
to live, and I wanted to hear

00:04:39.906 --> 00:04:41.711
about everything that I was missing.

00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:43.528
And by transitive property, I realized

00:04:43.528 --> 00:04:46.957
that some people were never going
to get to experience what it felt like

00:04:46.981 --> 00:04:49.052
to be a teenage girl in New York city.

00:04:49.052 --> 00:04:51.100
Which meant that they werenâ€™t
going to know

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:54.180
what the subway ride
after your first kiss feels like,

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.062
or how quiet it gets when its snows,

00:04:57.062 --> 00:04:59.348
and I wanted them to know,
I wanted to tell them

00:04:59.372 --> 00:05:01.669
and this became the focus of my obsession.

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.464
I busied myself telling stories
and sharing stories and collecting them.

00:05:05.464 --> 00:05:08.487
And it's not until recently
that I realized

00:05:08.487 --> 00:05:11.952
that I can't always rush poetry.

00:05:11.952 --> 00:05:16.108
In April for National Poetry Month
there's this challenge that,

00:05:16.108 --> 00:05:18.669
many poets in the poetry
community participate in,

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.057
and its called the 30/30 Challenge.

00:05:21.223 --> 00:05:23.978
The idea is you write
a new poem

00:05:24.003 --> 00:05:26.798
every single day
for the entire month of April.

00:05:27.552 --> 00:05:30.545
And last year I tried it for the first
time, and I was thrilled

00:05:30.545 --> 00:05:34.001
by the efficiency at which I was able
to produce poetry.

00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:38.309
But at the end of the month I looked
back at these 30 poems I had written,

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:42.402
and discovered that they were
all trying to tell the same story,

00:05:42.402 --> 00:05:46.829
it had just taken me 30 tries to figure
out the way that it wanted to be told.

00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:50.782
And I realized that this is probably true
of other stories on an even larger scale.

00:05:50.782 --> 00:05:53.211
I have stories that I have
tried to tell for years,

00:05:53.235 --> 00:05:57.062
rewriting and rewriting and constantly
searching for the right words.

00:05:57.062 --> 00:06:01.016
There's a French poet, an essayist
by the name of Paul Valery

00:06:01.016 --> 00:06:04.743
who said a poem is never
finished, it is only abandoned.

00:06:04.743 --> 00:06:07.263
And this terrifies me
because it implies that

00:06:07.263 --> 00:06:11.002
I could keep reediting and rewriting
forever and its up to me to decide

00:06:11.002 --> 00:06:15.763
when a poem is finished and when
I can walk away from it.

00:06:15.763 --> 00:06:18.716
And this goes directly against my very
obsessive nature to try

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.313
to find the right answer, and the perfect
words, and the right form.

00:06:22.313 --> 00:06:24.138
And I use poetry in my life,

00:06:24.163 --> 00:06:27.011
as a way to help me navigate
and work through things.

00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:30.047
But just because I end the poem,
doesn't mean that I've solved

00:06:30.047 --> 00:06:33.144
whatever I was puzzling through.

00:06:33.144 --> 00:06:34.764
I like to revisit old poetry,

00:06:34.764 --> 00:06:38.611
because it shows me exactly
where I was at that moment.

00:06:38.611 --> 00:06:41.197
And what it was I was trying
to navigate and the words

00:06:41.197 --> 00:06:43.090
that I chose to help me.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.542
Now, I have a story

00:06:44.567 --> 00:06:47.098
that I've been stumbling
over for years and years

00:06:47.098 --> 00:06:50.034
and I'm not sure if I've found
the prefect form,

00:06:50.034 --> 00:06:52.064
or whether this is just one attempt

00:06:52.064 --> 00:06:53.973
and I will try to rewrite it later

00:06:53.973 --> 00:06:55.827
in search of a better way to tell it.

00:06:55.827 --> 00:06:59.106
But I do know that later, when I look back

00:06:59.106 --> 00:07:01.735
I will be able to know
that this is where I was

00:07:01.735 --> 00:07:05.009
at this moment, and this
is what I was trying to navigate,

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:09.686
with these words, here,
in this room, with you.

00:07:10.732 --> 00:07:12.925
So -- Smile.

00:07:19.864 --> 00:07:22.521
It didn't always work this way.

00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:25.011
There is a time you have
to get your hands dirty.

00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:29.029
When you were in the dark,
for most of it, fumbling was a given,

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:32.076
and you needed more
contrast, more saturation,

00:07:32.076 --> 00:07:35.004
darker darks, and brighter brights.

00:07:35.004 --> 00:07:38.049
They called it extended development.
It meant you spent

00:07:38.049 --> 00:07:40.901
longer inhaling chemicals,
longer up to your wrist.

00:07:40.901 --> 00:07:42.363
It wasn't always easy.

00:07:42.363 --> 00:07:45.041
Grandpa Stewart was a navy photographer.

00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:48.311
Young, red-faced
with the sleeves rolled up,

00:07:48.311 --> 00:07:51.412
fists of fingers like fat rolls of coins,

00:07:51.412 --> 00:07:54.513
he looked like Popeye
the sailor man, come to life.

00:07:54.513 --> 00:07:56.245
Crooked smile, tuft of chest hair,

00:07:56.245 --> 00:07:59.771
he showed up at World War II,
with a smirk and a hobby.

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:02.420
When they asked him if he knew
much about photography,

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:06.280
he lied, learned to read
Europe like a map,

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.018
upside down, from the height
of a fighter plane,

00:08:09.018 --> 00:08:12.086
camera snapping, eyelids
flapping, the darkest darks

00:08:12.086 --> 00:08:14.009
and brightest brights.

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:17.019
He learned war like he could
read his way home.

00:08:17.019 --> 00:08:20.146
When other men returned,
they would put their weapons out to rest,

00:08:20.203 --> 00:08:22.967
but he, brought the lenses
and the cameras home with him.

00:08:22.967 --> 00:08:25.650
Opened a shop, turned it
into a family affair.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:29.043
My father was born into this
world of black and white.

00:08:29.043 --> 00:08:32.604
His basketball hands learned
the tiny clicks and slides

00:08:32.604 --> 00:08:35.063
of lens into frame, film into camera,

00:08:35.063 --> 00:08:37.000
chemical into plastic bin.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.014
His father knew the equipment
but not the art.

00:08:40.014 --> 00:08:42.001
He knew the darks but not the brights.

00:08:42.001 --> 00:08:46.024
My father learned the magic,
spent his time following light.

00:08:46.024 --> 00:08:48.990
Once he traveled across the country
to follow a forest fire,

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.968
hunted it with his camera for a week.

00:08:51.968 --> 00:08:54.299
"Follow the light," he said.

00:08:54.299 --> 00:08:55.830
"Follow the light."

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.497
There are parts of me
I only recognize from photographs.

00:08:58.521 --> 00:09:01.512
The loft on Wooster street
with the creaky hallways,

00:09:01.512 --> 00:09:04.517
the twelve-foot ceilings,
the white walls and cold floors.

00:09:04.517 --> 00:09:07.293
This was my mothers home,
before she was mother.

00:09:07.293 --> 00:09:10.237
Before she was wife, she was artist.

00:09:10.237 --> 00:09:11.960
And the only two rooms in the house,

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.532
with walls that reached
all the way up to the ceiling,

00:09:14.532 --> 00:09:16.159
and doors that opened and closed,

00:09:16.159 --> 00:09:18.711
were the bathroom and the dark room.

00:09:18.711 --> 00:09:21.045
The dark room she built
herself, with custom made

00:09:21.069 --> 00:09:25.010
stainless steel sinks,
an 8 by 10 bed enlarger

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.153
that moved up and down by a giant
hand crank,

00:09:27.177 --> 00:09:29.056
a bank of color balanced lights,

00:09:29.056 --> 00:09:31.408
a white glass wall for viewing prints,

00:09:31.408 --> 00:09:33.863
a drying rack that moved
in and out from the wall.

00:09:33.863 --> 00:09:35.930
My mother built herself a dark room.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.076
Made it her home.

00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:39.985
Fell in love with a man
with basketball hands,

00:09:39.985 --> 00:09:42.265
with the way he looked at light.

00:09:42.265 --> 00:09:44.364
They got married. Had a baby.

00:09:44.364 --> 00:09:46.013
Moved to a house near a park.

00:09:46.013 --> 00:09:49.008
But they kept the loft at Wooster street

00:09:49.008 --> 00:09:50.913
for birthday parties and treasure hunts.

00:09:50.937 --> 00:09:53.611
The baby tipped the gray scale.

00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:56.083
Filled her parents' photo
albums with red balloons

00:09:56.083 --> 00:09:57.173
and yellow icing.

00:09:57.173 --> 00:09:59.535
The baby grew into a girl
without freckles,

00:09:59.535 --> 00:10:01.002
with a crooked smile,

00:10:01.002 --> 00:10:05.711
who didnâ€™t understand why her friends did
not have dark rooms in their houses,

00:10:05.711 --> 00:10:07.490
who never saw her parents kiss,

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.449
who never saw them hold hands.

00:10:09.449 --> 00:10:11.164
But one day, another baby showed up.

00:10:11.188 --> 00:10:14.856
This one with perfect straight
hair and bubble gum cheeks.

00:10:14.856 --> 00:10:16.570
They named him sweet potato.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.423
When he laughed, he laughed so loudly,

00:10:18.423 --> 00:10:20.361
he scared the pigeons on the fire escape

00:10:20.361 --> 00:10:23.262
And the four of them lived
in that house near the park.

00:10:23.262 --> 00:10:25.903
The girl with no freckles,
and the sweet potato boy,

00:10:25.903 --> 00:10:28.142
the basketball father,
and the dark room mother

00:10:28.166 --> 00:10:30.872
and they lit their candles,
and they said their prayers,

00:10:30.872 --> 00:10:33.698
and the corners of the photographs curled.

00:10:33.698 --> 00:10:35.750
One day some towers fell

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.853
and the house near the park became
a house under ash, so they escaped.

00:10:39.853 --> 00:10:45.008
In backpacks, on bicycles to darkrooms
but the loft of Wooster street

00:10:45.008 --> 00:10:48.812
was built for an artist,
not a family of pigeons

00:10:48.812 --> 00:10:50.775
and walls that do not reach the ceiling

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:52.090
do not hold in the yelling

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:56.745
and a man with basketball hands
put his weapons out to rest.

00:10:56.745 --> 00:11:00.008
He could not fight this war
and no maps pointed home.

00:11:00.008 --> 00:11:01.678
His hands no longer fit his camera,

00:11:01.678 --> 00:11:03.360
no longer fit his wife's,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.858
no longer fit his body.

00:11:05.858 --> 00:11:08.713
The sweet potato boy mashed
his fists into his mouth

00:11:08.713 --> 00:11:10.285
until he had nothing more to say.

00:11:10.309 --> 00:11:14.022
So, the girl without freckles
went treasure hunting on her own.

00:11:14.022 --> 00:11:17.638
And on Wooster street, in a building
with a creaky hallways,

00:11:17.638 --> 00:11:19.490
and a loft of the 12-foot ceiling

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.482
and a darkroom with too many sinks

00:11:21.482 --> 00:11:24.028
under the color balance
light, she found a note,

00:11:24.028 --> 00:11:28.941
tacked to the wall thumb-tacked, left
over from the times before towers,

00:11:28.941 --> 00:11:31.485
from the time before babies.

00:11:31.485 --> 00:11:37.007
And the note said: "A guy sure loves
the girl who works in the darkroom."

00:11:37.007 --> 00:11:40.944
It was a year before my father
picked up a camera again.

00:11:40.944 --> 00:11:43.578
His first time out, he followed
the Christmas lights,

00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:46.013
dotting their way through New
York City's trees.

00:11:46.013 --> 00:11:50.967
Tiny dots of light, blinking out of him
from out of the darkest darks.

00:11:50.967 --> 00:11:53.030
A year later he traveled
across the country

00:11:53.055 --> 00:11:54.873
to follow a forest fire,

00:11:54.873 --> 00:11:57.527
stayed for a week hunting
it with his camera,

00:11:57.527 --> 00:11:59.497
it was ravaging the West Coast

00:11:59.497 --> 00:12:01.481
eating 18-wheeler trucks in its stride.

00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:03.062
On the other side of the country,

00:12:03.062 --> 00:12:06.062
I went to class and wrote a poem
on the margins of my notebook.

00:12:06.086 --> 00:12:08.765
We have both learned the art of capture.

00:12:08.765 --> 00:12:11.398
Maybe we are learning
the art of embracing.

00:12:11.448 --> 00:12:14.873
Maybe we are learning
the art of letting go.

00:12:16.005 --> 00:12:21.166
Thank You. (Applause)
