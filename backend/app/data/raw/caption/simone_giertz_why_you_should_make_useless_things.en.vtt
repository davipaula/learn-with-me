00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.096
Hello.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.320
My name is Simone.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.576
You know how people tell you
if you get nervous when onstage,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.096
picture people in the audience naked?

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.496
Like it's this thing that's supposed
to make you feel better.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.776
But I was thinking --

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.216
picturing all of you naked in 2018
feels kind of weird and wrong.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.256
Like, we're working really hard
on moving past stuff like that,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.896
so we need a new method of dealing with

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.056
if you get nervous onstage.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.216
And I realized that what I'd really like

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.296
is that I can look at you
as much as you're looking at me --

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.736
just to even things out a little bit.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.496
So if I had way more eyeballs,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.296
then we'd all be
really comfortable, right?

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.056
So in preparation for this talk,
I made myself a shirt.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.230
(Rattling)

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.920
(Laughter)

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.776
It's googly eyes.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.896
It took me 14 hours

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.616
and 227 googly eyes to make this shirt.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.696
And being able to look at you
as much as you're looking at me

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.216
is actually only half
of the reason I made this.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.176
The other half is being able to do this.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.536
(Googly eyes rattle)

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.816
(Laughter)

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.576
So I do a lot of things like this.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.416
I see a problem and I invent
some sort of solution to it.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.256
For example, brushing your teeth.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.216
Like, it's this thing we all have to do,
it's kind of boring,

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.336
and nobody really likes it.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.736
If there were any
seven-year-olds in the audience,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.256
they'd be like, "Yes!"

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.120
So what about if you had
a machine that could do it for you?

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.920
(Laughter)

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.960
I call it ...

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.320
I call it "The Toothbrush Helmet."

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.680
(Laughter)

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.216
(Robot arm buzzing)

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.456
(Laughter)

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.976
(Applause)

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.536
So my toothbrush helmet is recommended
by zero out of 10 dentists,

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.736
and it definitely did not
revolutionize the world of dentistry,

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.936
but it did completely change my life.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.416
Because I finished making this toothbrush
helmet three years ago

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.976
and after I finished making it,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.656
I went into my living room
and I put up a camera,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.160
and I filmed a seven-second
clip of it working.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.976
And by now,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.896
this is a pretty standard
modern-day fairy tale

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.136
of girl posting on the internet,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.736
the internet takes the girl by storm,

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.576
thousands of men voyage
into the comment sections

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.296
to ask for her hand in marriage --

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.336
(Laughter)

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.696
She ignores all of them,
starts a YouTube channel

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.360
and keeps on building robots.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.056
Since then, I've carved out this little
niche for myself on the internet

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.576
as an inventor of useless machines,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.256
because as we all know,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.936
the easiest way
to be at the top of your field

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.056
is to choose a very small field.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.296
(Laughter)

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.656
(Applause)

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.856
So I run a YouTube channel
about my machines,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.656
and I've done things
like cutting hair with drones --

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.376
(Drone buzzes)

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.776
(Laughter)

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.856
(Drone crashes)

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.296
(Laughter)

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.416
(Drone buzzes)

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.336
(Laughter)

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.456
(Applause)

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.216
To a machine that helps me
wake up in the morning --

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.176
(Alarm)

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.600
(Laughter)

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.936
(Video) Simone: Ow!

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.536
To this machine
that helps me chop vegetables.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.000
(Knives chop)

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.456
I'm not an engineer.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.816
I did not study engineering in school.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.416
But I was a super ambitious
student growing up.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.936
In middle school and high school,
I had straight A's,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.176
and I graduated at the top of my year.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.456
On the flip side of that,

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.176
I struggled with very severe
performance anxiety.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.216
Here's an email I sent
to my brother around that time.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.136
"You won't understand
how difficult it is for me to tell you,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.376
to confess this.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.776
I'm so freaking embarrassed.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.016
I don't want people
to think that I'm stupid.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.616
Now I'm starting to cry too.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.096
Damn."

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.656
And no, I did not accidentally burn
our parents' house down.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.976
The thing I'm writing about in the email
and the thing I'm so upset about

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.240
is that I got a B on a math test.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.680
So something obviously happened
between here and here.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.016
(Laughter)

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.216
One of those things was puberty.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.616
(Laughter)

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.016
Beautiful time indeed.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.376
But moreover,

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.536
I got interested in building robots,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.816
and I wanted to teach myself
about hardware.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.336
But building things with hardware,
especially if you're teaching yourself,

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.736
is something that's really
difficult to do.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.656
It has a high likelihood of failure

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.896
and moreover,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.696
it has a high likelihood
of making you feel stupid.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.840
And that was my biggest fear at the time.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.896
So I came up with a setup that would
guarantee success 100 percent of the time.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.296
With my setup, it would be
nearly impossible to fail.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.296
And that was that instead
of trying to succeed,

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.880
I was going to try to build
things that would fail.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.616
And even though I didn't
realize it at the time,

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.576
building stupid things
was actually quite smart,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.256
because as I kept on
learning about hardware,

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.736
for the first time in my life,

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.280
I did not have to deal
with my performance anxiety.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.576
And as soon as I removed
all pressure and expectations from myself,

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.976
that pressure quickly
got replaced by enthusiasm,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.760
and it allowed me to just play.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.136
So as an inventor,

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.576
I'm interested in things
that people struggle with.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.176
It can be small things or big things
or medium-sized things

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.736
and something like giving a TED talk
presents this whole new set of problems

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.256
that I can solve.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.376
And identifying a problem
is the first step in my process

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.880
of building a useless machine.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.056
So before I came here,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.656
I sat down and I thought of some
of the potential problems I might have

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.960
in giving this talk.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.000
Forgetting what to say.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.776
That people won't laugh --

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.000
that's you.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.296
Or even worse,

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.240
that you'll laugh at the wrong things --

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.056
that was an OK part to laugh at,

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.296
thank you.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.336
(Laughter)

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.736
Or that when I get nervous,
my hands start shaking

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.816
and I'm really self-conscious about it.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.976
Or that my fly has been
open this entire time

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.056
and all of you noticed but I didn't,

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.136
but it's closed so we're
all good on that one.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.616
But one thing I'm actually really
nervous about is my hands shaking.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.816
I remember when I was a kid,

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.536
giving presentations in school,

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.656
I would have my notes on a piece of paper,

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.136
and I would put a notebook
behind the paper

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.416
so that people wouldn't be able
to see the paper quivering.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.160
And I give a lot of talks.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.056
I know that about half of you
in the audience are probably like,

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.056
"Building useless machines is really fun,

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.736
but how is this in any way
or form a business?"

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.696
And giving talks is a part of it.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.776
And the arrangers always put out
a glass of water for you onstage

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.136
so you have something to drink
if you get thirsty,

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.056
and I always so badly
want to drink that water,

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.936
but I don't dare to pick the glass up

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.256
because then people might be able
to see that my hands are shaking.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.376
So what about a machine
that hands you a glass of water?

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.576
Sold to the nervous girl
in the googly-eye shirt.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.600
Actually, I need to take this off
because I have a thing --

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.320
(Googly eyes rattle)

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.816
Oh.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.336
(Clanking)

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.120
(Laughter)

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.456
I still don't know what to call this,

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.016
but I think some sort of
"head orbit device,"

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.056
because it rotates
this platform around you

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.576
and you can put anything on it.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.416
You can have a camera;
you can get photos of your entire head.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:24.336
Like it's really --
it's a very versatile machine.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.056
(Laughter)

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.976
OK, and I have --

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.416
I mean, you can put
some snacks on it, for example,

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.696
if you want to.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.536
I have some popcorn here.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.040
And you just put a little bit like that.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.536
And then you want to --

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.376
there's some sacrifices for science --

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.456
just some popcorn falling on the floor.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.895
Let's do the long way around.

00:08:47.919 --> 00:08:49.616
(Robot buzzes)

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.416
(Laughter)

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.015
And then you have a little hand.

00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:54.856
You need to adjust the height of it,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.456
and you just do it by shrugging.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.376
(Laughter)

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.616
(Applause)

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.896
It has a little hand.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.136
(Hand thwacks)

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.376
(Laughter)

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.960
(Applause)

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.176
I just bumped my mic off,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.120
but I think we're all good.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.656
OK, also I need to chew this popcorn,

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.616
so if you guys could
just clap your hands a little bit more --

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.736
(Applause)

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.576
OK, so it's like your own
little personal solar system,

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.496
because I'm a millennial,

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.976
so I want everything to revolve around me.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.056
(Laughter)

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.696
Back to the glass of water,
that's what we're here for.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.776
So, I promise -- I mean, it still has --

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.376
it doesn't have any water in it,

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.896
I'm sorry.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:49.496
But I still need to work
on this machine a little bit

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.776
because I still need to pick up the glass
and put it on the platform,

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.816
but if your hands
are shaking a little bit,

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.096
nobody's going to notice

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.016
because you're wearing
a very mesmerizing piece of equipment.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.456
So, we're all good.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.680
OK.

00:10:02.146 --> 00:10:03.296
(Robot buzzes)

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.760
(Singing)

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.296
Oh no, it got stuck.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.480
Isn't it comforting that even robots
sometimes get stage fright?

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.040
It just gets stuck a little bit.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.960
It's very human of them.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.496
Oh wait, let's go back a little bit,

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.736
and then --

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.976
(Glass falls)

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.176
(Laughter)

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.656
Isn't it a beautiful time to be alive?

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.936
(Laughter)

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:34.560
(Applause)

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:41.296
So as much as my machines can seem
like simple engineering slapstick,

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.736
I realize that I stumbled
on something bigger than that.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.656
It's this expression of joy and humility
that often gets lost in engineering,

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.216
and for me it was a way
to learn about hardware

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.040
without having my performance
anxiety get in the way.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:59.656
I often get asked if I think I'm ever
going to build something useful,

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.200
and maybe someday I will.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.736
But the way I see it,

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.056
I already have

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.440
because I've built myself this job

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.176
and it's something that I could
never have planned for,

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.416
or that I could --

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.560
(Applause)

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.416
It's something that I could
never have planned for.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.976
Instead it happened just because
I was enthusiastic about what I was doing,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.736
and I was sharing that enthusiasm
with other people.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.136
To me that's the true beauty
of making useless things,

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.176
because it's this acknowledgment

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.600
that you don't always know
what the best answer is.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.496
And it turns off that voice in your head

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.976
that tells you that you know
exactly how the world works.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.336
And maybe a toothbrush helmet
isn't the answer,

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.296
but at least you're asking the question.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.536
Thank you.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.600
(Applause)
