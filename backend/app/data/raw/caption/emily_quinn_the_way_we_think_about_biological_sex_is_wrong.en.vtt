00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:14.515
[This talk contains mature content]

00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:17.349
I have a vagina.

00:00:17.373 --> 00:00:18.643
(Laughter)

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:20.600
Just thought you should know.

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.675
That might not come
as a surprise to some of you.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.452
I look like a woman.

00:00:26.054 --> 00:00:27.852
I'm dressed like one, I guess.

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:31.326
The thing is, I also have balls.

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.278
And it does take a lot of nerve

00:00:34.302 --> 00:00:37.863
to come up here and talk to you
about my genitalia.

00:00:37.887 --> 00:00:39.161
Just a little.

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:42.530
But I'm not talking
about bravery or courage.

00:00:42.554 --> 00:00:44.754
I mean literally -- I have balls.

00:00:45.268 --> 00:00:46.569
Right here,

00:00:46.593 --> 00:00:48.601
right where a lot of you have ovaries.

00:00:49.157 --> 00:00:51.116
I'm not male or female.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.290
I'm intersex.

00:00:53.316 --> 00:00:57.141
Most people assume that you're
biologically either a man or a woman,

00:00:57.165 --> 00:00:59.992
but it's actually a lot more
complex than that.

00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:03.911
There are so many ways
somebody could be intersex.

00:01:03.935 --> 00:01:06.982
In my case, it means
I was born with XY chromosomes,

00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:09.202
which you probably know
as male chromosomes.

00:01:09.562 --> 00:01:13.938
And I was born with a vagina
and balls inside my body.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.784
I don't respond to testosterone,

00:01:16.808 --> 00:01:19.839
so during puberty, I grew breasts,

00:01:19.863 --> 00:01:24.196
but I never got acne
or body hair, body oil.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.830
You can be jealous of that.

00:01:25.854 --> 00:01:27.879
(Laughter)

00:01:27.903 --> 00:01:30.292
But even though I don't
actually have a uterus --

00:01:30.316 --> 00:01:31.466
I was born without one,

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.856
so I don't menstruate,
I can't have biological children.

00:01:36.308 --> 00:01:39.346
We put people in boxes
based on their genitalia.

00:01:39.695 --> 00:01:43.465
Before a baby's even born,
we ask whether it's a boy or a girl,

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:45.505
as if it actually matters;

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:48.251
as if you're going to be less excited
about having a baby

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:50.426
if it doesn't have
the genitals you wanted;

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.591
as if what's between somebody's legs
tells you anything about that person.

00:01:55.212 --> 00:01:58.156
Are they kind, generous, funny?

00:01:58.712 --> 00:02:00.038
Smart?

00:02:00.062 --> 00:02:02.109
Who do they want to be when they grow up?

00:02:02.546 --> 00:02:05.085
Genitals don't actually tell you anything.

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:07.685
Yet, we define ourselves by them.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.306
In this society, we love
putting people into boxes

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.567
and labeling each other.

00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:15.194
It kind of gives us a sense of belonging

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:19.096
and teaches us how to interact
with one another.

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:22.050
But there's one really big problem:

00:02:22.074 --> 00:02:25.307
biological sex is not black or white.

00:02:26.114 --> 00:02:27.380
It's on a spectrum.

00:02:28.098 --> 00:02:31.588
Besides your genitalia,
you also have your chromosomes,

00:02:31.612 --> 00:02:34.207
your gonads, like ovaries or testicles.

00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:36.080
You have your internal sex organs,

00:02:36.104 --> 00:02:39.398
your hormone production,
your hormone response

00:02:39.422 --> 00:02:43.919
and your secondary sex characteristics,
like breast development, body hair, etc.

00:02:44.538 --> 00:02:49.586
Those seven areas of biological sex
all have so much variation,

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.536
yet we only get two options:

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.876
male or female.

00:02:53.435 --> 00:02:55.125
Which is kind of absurd to me,

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:57.855
because I can't think
of a single other human trait

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.117
that there's only two options for:

00:03:00.141 --> 00:03:03.434
skin color, hair, height, eyes.

00:03:03.866 --> 00:03:08.047
You can either have nose A or nose B,
that's it, no other options.

00:03:08.866 --> 00:03:12.017
If there are infinite ways
for our bodies to look,

00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:13.692
our minds to think,

00:03:13.716 --> 00:03:15.605
personalities to act,

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.121
wouldn't it make sense
that there's that much variety

00:03:18.145 --> 00:03:19.678
in biological sex, too?

00:03:22.141 --> 00:03:26.093
Did you know that besides
XX or XY chromosomes,

00:03:26.117 --> 00:03:29.799
you could have XX and XY chromosomes?

00:03:29.823 --> 00:03:32.284
Or you could have an extra X -- XXY.

00:03:32.308 --> 00:03:34.394
Or two extra -- XXXY.

00:03:34.854 --> 00:03:36.062
Goes on from there.

00:03:36.086 --> 00:03:38.773
And for those "normal"
people with XX or XY,

00:03:38.797 --> 00:03:39.950
what does that mean?

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.077
I have XY chromosomes.

00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:45.455
If my DNA is found
at the scene of a crime --

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.988
not saying it will,
but, you know, we'll see.

00:03:48.012 --> 00:03:49.772
(Laughter)

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:53.886
If my skeleton is discovered
thousands of years from now,

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.310
I'll be labeled male.

00:03:56.125 --> 00:03:57.325
Is that the truth?

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.457
My balls would say so.

00:04:00.093 --> 00:04:01.871
But what about the rest of me?

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:06.926
And what if a woman has ovarian cancer
and has to have her ovaries removed?

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.961
Does she still qualify as a woman?

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.085
What about other intersex people
who are born without balls or ovaries

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.901
or with just one
or a combination of the two?

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:17.529
Where do they go?

00:04:18.647 --> 00:04:20.710
Do you have to have a uterus
to be a woman?

00:04:20.734 --> 00:04:22.874
There's a lot of us
who are born without one.

00:04:23.726 --> 00:04:26.646
And everyone's favorite part, genitalia:

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.617
you either have one or the other, right?

00:04:28.641 --> 00:04:31.752
You either have a six-inch-long penis
that's exactly this thick,

00:04:31.776 --> 00:04:34.411
jutting straight out of the body
at a 90-degree angle,

00:04:34.435 --> 00:04:36.768
or you have a vagina
that's this wide internally

00:04:36.792 --> 00:04:39.657
and a clitoris that's half an inch
above the vaginal opening

00:04:39.681 --> 00:04:42.641
and labia that look exactly
like they're supposed to look like,

00:04:42.665 --> 00:04:45.506
according to that one porn video
you watched that one time.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.699
You know the one.

00:04:46.723 --> 00:04:50.077
If you've been with more than one
sexual partner in your lifetime,

00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:52.038
and you line them up, one by one,

00:04:52.062 --> 00:04:55.547
I guarantee you can identify them
just by their genitalia.

00:04:55.571 --> 00:04:56.750
(Laughter)

00:04:56.774 --> 00:04:58.187
Think about it.

00:04:58.211 --> 00:04:59.363
Go on.

00:04:59.387 --> 00:05:00.753
(Laughter)

00:05:00.777 --> 00:05:01.927
I see you.

00:05:02.253 --> 00:05:03.403
No judging.

00:05:04.253 --> 00:05:05.625
Just notice.

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:07.049
All different, right?

00:05:08.633 --> 00:05:12.799
The sex and gender binary
are both so ingrained in our society,

00:05:12.823 --> 00:05:14.871
that we never stop to think about it.

00:05:14.895 --> 00:05:18.514
We just automatically place each other
into one box or the other,

00:05:18.538 --> 00:05:21.412
as if it actually matters.

00:05:21.436 --> 00:05:24.761
Until somebody comes along
to make you question it.

00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:31.520
And if you're thinking that
I'm the exception, an anomaly, an outlier:

00:05:31.544 --> 00:05:35.765
intersex people represent
around two percent of the population.

00:05:36.673 --> 00:05:40.008
That's the same percentage
as genetic redheads.

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:44.768
It's about 150 million people, roughly,

00:05:44.792 --> 00:05:47.454
which is more than
the entire population of Russia.

00:05:48.474 --> 00:05:51.976
So there's a lot of us, needless to say.

00:05:52.558 --> 00:05:54.256
We're not new or rare.

00:05:54.984 --> 00:05:56.303
We're just invisible.

00:05:57.587 --> 00:06:01.071
We've existed throughout
every culture in history.

00:06:01.373 --> 00:06:03.479
Yet, we never talk about it.

00:06:04.437 --> 00:06:07.468
In fact, a lot of people might not know
that they're intersex.

00:06:07.831 --> 00:06:11.196
Have you had a karyotype test
to determine your chromosomes?

00:06:12.632 --> 00:06:15.759
What about a full blood panel
for all of your hormone levels?

00:06:16.428 --> 00:06:19.547
A friend of mine found out
last year, in his 50s.

00:06:20.254 --> 00:06:21.928
The executive director of interACT,

00:06:21.952 --> 00:06:26.482
which is the leading organization
for intersex human rights here in the US,

00:06:26.506 --> 00:06:29.239
she found out she was intersex at age 41.

00:06:30.188 --> 00:06:33.498
Her doctors found out when she was 15,

00:06:33.522 --> 00:06:35.189
but they didn't tell her.

00:06:35.855 --> 00:06:39.156
They lied and said that she had cancer,

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.172
because that seemed like an easier option

00:06:41.196 --> 00:06:43.900
than finding out
she wasn't "fully" a woman.

00:06:45.006 --> 00:06:46.593
This kind of thing happens a lot,

00:06:46.617 --> 00:06:51.187
where intersex people are lied to
or kept in the dark about our bodies,

00:06:51.211 --> 00:06:53.342
which comes as a surprise
to a lot of people.

00:06:53.366 --> 00:06:57.798
But we live in a society that doesn't talk
about sex or bodies at all,

00:06:57.822 --> 00:07:00.245
unless it's to mock or shame each other.

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:03.832
I found out I was intersex at age 10,

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:07.674
and for the most part,
I was fine with that information.

00:07:08.055 --> 00:07:09.300
It didn't really faze me;

00:07:09.324 --> 00:07:12.480
I was still developing
my understanding of the world.

00:07:13.186 --> 00:07:15.416
It wasn't until I got older

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.424
and realized I didn't fit
society's expectations of me,

00:07:19.448 --> 00:07:22.518
that I didn't belong, that I was abnormal.

00:07:22.542 --> 00:07:24.517
And that's when the shame started.

00:07:25.522 --> 00:07:28.372
How many times have you seen kids
play with the "wrong" toys

00:07:28.396 --> 00:07:29.555
for their gender?

00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:31.101
Or try on the "wrong" clothes?

00:07:31.634 --> 00:07:32.834
All the time, right?

00:07:33.269 --> 00:07:36.306
Kids don't have these ideas
about gender norm,

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.496
they don't have shame
about who they're supposed to be

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.045
or what they're supposed to like or love.

00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:46.133
They don't care about any of this stuff.

00:07:46.157 --> 00:07:48.934
They don't have shame
until we put it on them.

00:07:50.626 --> 00:07:52.681
I also had doctors lie to me.

00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:57.371
At age 10, they told me
that I would also get cancer

00:07:57.395 --> 00:07:59.014
unless I removed my balls.

00:07:59.911 --> 00:08:02.529
Then they proceeded
to tell me that every year.

00:08:02.942 --> 00:08:06.255
Until today, there are still doctors
who want me to remove them.

00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:08.965
But there's literally no reason.

00:08:09.847 --> 00:08:14.657
If a typical XY male,
like yourself, has testicles,

00:08:14.681 --> 00:08:16.665
and one is undescended,

00:08:16.689 --> 00:08:19.157
there's a high chance of it
becoming cancerous --

00:08:19.181 --> 00:08:21.863
or a higher chance
of it becoming cancerous.

00:08:21.887 --> 00:08:23.298
They need to thermoregulated.

00:08:23.322 --> 00:08:26.712
So they drop down
away from the body to cool off,

00:08:26.736 --> 00:08:29.299
or they shrink back up to get warm.

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:31.149
Mine don't need to do that.

00:08:31.173 --> 00:08:35.379
They're not responding to testosterone,
they're not producing sperm.

00:08:35.403 --> 00:08:37.752
They're fine right here inside my body.

00:08:38.355 --> 00:08:42.228
Yet, because there's such a lack
of information about intersex people,

00:08:42.252 --> 00:08:44.347
my doctors never understood
the difference.

00:08:44.371 --> 00:08:46.364
They never really understood my body.

00:08:47.466 --> 00:08:48.633
As I got older,

00:08:48.657 --> 00:08:52.344
I had another doctor tell me that
I needed to have surgery on my vagina.

00:08:52.909 --> 00:08:56.673
She said that until I had an operation,
until she operated,

00:08:56.697 --> 00:09:02.188
I would not be able to have
"normal sex" with my husband one day.

00:09:02.212 --> 00:09:03.362
Her words.

00:09:05.212 --> 00:09:07.577
I didn't end up going through
with the operation,

00:09:07.601 --> 00:09:09.802
and I'm incredibly grateful for that.

00:09:11.855 --> 00:09:13.905
I'm not here to talk about my sex life.

00:09:13.929 --> 00:09:15.109
(Laughter)

00:09:15.133 --> 00:09:18.236
But let's just say it's fine.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.625
(Laughter)

00:09:20.622 --> 00:09:22.784
I'm fine, my body is fine.

00:09:22.808 --> 00:09:25.284
You actually wouldn’t be able
to tell the difference

00:09:25.308 --> 00:09:28.425
between me and another person
unless I told you;

00:09:28.449 --> 00:09:31.778
you wouldn't be able to tell
that I was intersex unless I told you.

00:09:32.223 --> 00:09:35.707
But again, because of the lack
of understanding about bodies,

00:09:35.731 --> 00:09:37.834
my doctor didn't understand
the difference.

00:09:38.723 --> 00:09:41.456
And for the most part,
my sex life is fine.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.799
The only issue that really comes up

00:09:43.823 --> 00:09:49.426
is that sometimes, sexual situations
bring up memories of doctors touching me,

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:51.966
over and over again since I was 10.

00:09:53.435 --> 00:09:56.863
I've been really lucky to escape --

00:09:56.887 --> 00:09:59.522
I didn't think I would get emotional --

00:09:59.546 --> 00:10:03.688
I've been really lucky to escape
the physical harm

00:10:03.712 --> 00:10:06.410
that comes from these
unnecessary surgeries.

00:10:07.792 --> 00:10:11.561
But no intersex person is free
from the emotional harm

00:10:11.585 --> 00:10:16.082
that comes from living in a society
that tries to cover up your existence.

00:10:17.752 --> 00:10:21.189
Most of my intersex friends
have had operations like these.

00:10:21.669 --> 00:10:24.967
Oftentimes, they will remove
testes like mine,

00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:31.022
even though my risk of testicular cancer
is lower than the risk of breast cancer

00:10:31.046 --> 00:10:36.161
in a typical woman with
no predisposition, no family history.

00:10:36.538 --> 00:10:39.764
But we don't tell her
to remove her breasts, do we?

00:10:42.149 --> 00:10:45.537
It's rare to meet an intersex person
that hasn't been operated on.

00:10:48.385 --> 00:10:53.476
Oftentimes, these surgeries are done
to improve intersex kids' lives,

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.760
but they usually end up
doing the opposite,

00:10:55.784 --> 00:10:59.745
causing more harm and complications,

00:10:59.769 --> 00:11:01.541
both physical and emotional.

00:11:04.689 --> 00:11:07.915
I'm not saying that
doctors are bad or evil.

00:11:07.939 --> 00:11:12.678
It's just that we live in a society
that causes some doctors to "fix"

00:11:12.702 --> 00:11:15.776
those of us who don't fit
their definition of normal.

00:11:17.546 --> 00:11:20.617
We're not problems that need to be fixed.

00:11:21.125 --> 00:11:25.167
We just live in a society
that needs to be enlightened.

00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:27.819
One of the ways I'm doing that

00:11:27.843 --> 00:11:31.194
is by creating a genderless
puberty guidebook

00:11:31.218 --> 00:11:34.479
that can teach kids
about their bodies as they grow up.

00:11:34.503 --> 00:11:36.814
Not their girl bodies
or their boy bodies --

00:11:36.838 --> 00:11:38.461
just their bodies.

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:42.649
We often place unrealistic expectations
on the things that our bodies do

00:11:42.673 --> 00:11:44.411
that are outside of our control.

00:11:44.982 --> 00:11:48.450
I mean, if one man can grow
a full, luxurious, hipster beard,

00:11:48.474 --> 00:11:52.061
and the other can only grow
a few mustache hairs,

00:11:52.085 --> 00:11:54.286
what does that mean
about who they are as men?

00:11:55.442 --> 00:11:56.592
Nothing.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.840
It literally, most likely, just means

00:11:58.864 --> 00:12:02.218
that their hair follicles
respond to testosterone in different ways.

00:12:03.212 --> 00:12:07.073
Yet, how many times have you heard
a man ashamed about something like this?

00:12:10.519 --> 00:12:13.621
Imagine a world where
we could live in a society

00:12:13.645 --> 00:12:16.952
that teaches us not to have shame

00:12:16.976 --> 00:12:20.309
about the things
that our bodies do or do not do.

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:28.664
I want to change the way that we think
about biological sex in this society --

00:12:29.458 --> 00:12:31.192
which is a lot to ask for.

00:12:31.935 --> 00:12:33.800
You could say it's ballsy, I guess.

00:12:33.824 --> 00:12:36.072
(Laughter)

00:12:36.987 --> 00:12:40.319
But eventually we accepted
the world as round, right?

00:12:40.795 --> 00:12:43.898
We no longer diagnose gay people
with mental disorders

00:12:43.922 --> 00:12:45.668
or women with hysteria.

00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:51.112
We don't think epilepsy is caused
by the devil anymore, so that's cool.

00:12:51.136 --> 00:12:52.311
(Laughter)

00:12:52.335 --> 00:12:56.260
We constantly change and evolve,
the more we understand as a society.

00:12:57.223 --> 00:12:59.336
And biological sex is on a spectrum.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.684
It's not black or white.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.018
Not only could that knowledge
save intersex kids

00:13:04.042 --> 00:13:06.159
from physical and emotional harm,

00:13:06.183 --> 00:13:08.444
I think it would help everyone else, too.

00:13:09.532 --> 00:13:13.159
Who here has ever felt
inadequate or ashamed

00:13:13.183 --> 00:13:16.799
because you weren't girly enough,
you were too girly,

00:13:16.823 --> 00:13:19.357
you weren't manly enough, or too manly?

00:13:19.998 --> 00:13:23.060
We constantly shame people
for not fitting into a box,

00:13:23.084 --> 00:13:24.284
but the reality is,

00:13:24.308 --> 00:13:28.283
I think we shame others
because it prevents them from seeing

00:13:28.307 --> 00:13:30.894
that we don't fit
inside our boxes, either.

00:13:31.689 --> 00:13:35.688
And the truth is that
nobody actually fits in a box,

00:13:35.712 --> 00:13:37.378
because they don't exist.

00:13:37.966 --> 00:13:43.506
This binary, this false male-female facade
is something we constructed,

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:44.779
we built ourselves.

00:13:44.803 --> 00:13:46.887
But it doesn't have to exist.

00:13:48.514 --> 00:13:50.355
We can break it down.

00:13:50.379 --> 00:13:53.179
And that's what I want to do.

00:13:54.282 --> 00:13:55.432
Will you join me?

00:13:57.129 --> 00:13:58.280
Thanks.

00:13:58.304 --> 00:14:03.026
(Applause)
