00:00:12.995 --> 00:00:16.243
My subject is the future of life on Earth.

00:00:16.253 --> 00:00:19.448
This is a very large and complex topic.

00:00:19.448 --> 00:00:22.004
It's the subject of futurology.

00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:25.924
And in fact, I am a palaeontologist,
I study dinosaurs,

00:00:25.924 --> 00:00:27.018
and you might wonder

00:00:27.018 --> 00:00:30.909
why a palaeontologist would have
something to say about the future.

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:34.575
However, there are some shared aspects
which I will talk about,

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:39.147
and this can provide some evidence
to help us in making decisions.

00:00:39.357 --> 00:00:41.324
Iâ€™m a palaeontologist, as I say.

00:00:41.324 --> 00:00:44.595
I decided on this career
when I was seven years old.

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:46.956
I loved dinosaurs at the age of seven,

00:00:46.956 --> 00:00:50.704
and I think these days,
young people still do.

00:00:51.204 --> 00:00:52.947
And I haven't changed my view since.

00:00:52.947 --> 00:00:55.655
I love the job, teaching students,

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:59.930
going to exotic parts of the world
to dig up dinosaurs,

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.135
finding new facts
about the history of life.

00:01:03.255 --> 00:01:06.683
However, this kind of subject,
studying the past,

00:01:06.683 --> 00:01:08.613
like studying the future,

00:01:08.613 --> 00:01:12.788
could be said by some
not to be truly scientific.

00:01:12.788 --> 00:01:15.137
And I want to explore that
a little bit first,

00:01:15.137 --> 00:01:16.754
how do we do this,

00:01:16.754 --> 00:01:21.474
before we get to the point of beginning
to establish some facts and figures

00:01:21.474 --> 00:01:24.266
about life and current threats.

00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:27.166
And this has been criticised
by other scientists.

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.586
For example, 100 years ago,

00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:30.803
Sir Ernest Rutherford,

00:01:30.803 --> 00:01:33.703
a very famous physicist,
Nobel Prize winner,

00:01:33.703 --> 00:01:39.117
said, 'All of science is physics,
and the rest is stamp collecting.'

00:01:39.117 --> 00:01:42.705
By which he meant that if you cannot
make it into mathematics or physics,

00:01:42.705 --> 00:01:44.215
it doesn't count.

00:01:44.215 --> 00:01:49.397
That excludes then the natural sciences,
medicine and a lot of other areas.

00:01:49.427 --> 00:01:53.977
And I think at the far end of the spectrum
would be my subject, palaeontology.

00:01:54.457 --> 00:01:56.336
I'd like to give you an example though,

00:01:56.336 --> 00:01:59.926
to show you how 
we apply scientific methods

00:01:59.926 --> 00:02:04.326
to achieve a certain level 
of understanding and certainty.

00:02:04.356 --> 00:02:08.476
And this is something that has been
developing during my career

00:02:08.476 --> 00:02:09.707
so that when I started,

00:02:09.707 --> 00:02:13.640
a lot of what we did would be called
a speculation or guesswork,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.434
whereas now, a lot of what
we do can be tested

00:02:16.434 --> 00:02:18.668
and can be called scientific.

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:23.725
The example I'm going to take 
is the question I asked when I was seven,

00:02:23.725 --> 00:02:27.346
'Could T. rex bite a car in half?'

00:02:27.816 --> 00:02:32.336
This is a question about the most
famous dinosaur, Tyrannosaurus Rex,

00:02:32.336 --> 00:02:36.728
which was huge, five tons in weight,
enormous jaws and teeth.

00:02:36.728 --> 00:02:38.585
Could it bite a car in half?

00:02:38.585 --> 00:02:40.614
Well, there were no cars
in the Cretaceous,

00:02:40.614 --> 00:02:42.659
but let's forget that for the moment.

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:46.597
When I started, you could only 
answer that question by guesswork,

00:02:46.597 --> 00:02:50.697
or you could make some very
simple models of the skull, like levers,

00:02:50.697 --> 00:02:52.765
and try to calculate things.

00:02:53.325 --> 00:02:55.855
If you were going
to make a realistic model

00:02:55.855 --> 00:03:00.696
that had all the properties of the
original bone and flesh of the dinosaur,

00:03:00.696 --> 00:03:02.134
you could not do it.

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:06.636
But now, with the power of computing,
we can do this kind of thing.

00:03:06.656 --> 00:03:10.067
So the way you calculate
the bite force of T. rex,

00:03:10.067 --> 00:03:12.047
and the way people have done it,

00:03:12.047 --> 00:03:14.536
is they scan a skull

00:03:14.536 --> 00:03:19.076
and make a three-dimensional,
digital model inside the computer.

00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:22.666
You then divide that model into a mesh,

00:03:22.666 --> 00:03:26.116
or into a framework of elements

00:03:26.116 --> 00:03:28.465
or small components.

00:03:28.635 --> 00:03:32.655
And each of these elements
can be given physical properties

00:03:32.655 --> 00:03:37.105
so that we know the physical properties
of bone of living animals.

00:03:37.105 --> 00:03:38.576
These are material properties,

00:03:38.576 --> 00:03:42.576
like how far can you twist
the bone before it breaks,

00:03:42.576 --> 00:03:45.537
how much compression can that bone take.

00:03:45.787 --> 00:03:48.819
And so all of those properties
are mapped into the skull.

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.246
And then you apply imaginary forces

00:03:51.246 --> 00:03:54.753
and increase those pressures
until the thing breaks.

00:03:54.783 --> 00:03:57.565
And so the bite force of T. rex is huge.

00:03:57.565 --> 00:03:59.468
Let me lead you to the figure.

00:03:59.468 --> 00:04:03.884
Our bite force is about
800 newtons at most.

00:04:03.884 --> 00:04:07.884
The biggest bite force of any 
living animal is the great white shark,

00:04:07.884 --> 00:04:10.545
and that is about 5,000 newtons.

00:04:11.075 --> 00:04:14.685
T. rex, 50,000 newtons, ten times.

00:04:14.935 --> 00:04:19.228
And that's equivalent
to five tons of weight, acting.

00:04:19.228 --> 00:04:21.056
So it could bite a car in half.

00:04:21.056 --> 00:04:22.646
Why do we believe this method?

00:04:22.646 --> 00:04:27.474
Because this method is a standard
in design and architecture.

00:04:27.474 --> 00:04:31.478
Finite element analysis is used
for designing buildings like this one.

00:04:31.478 --> 00:04:34.732
You don't simply build it
and hope it doesn't fall down.

00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:37.398
The thing is designed in a computer,

00:04:37.398 --> 00:04:42.572
it is stress-tested using this program
we apply to the dinosaur.

00:04:42.572 --> 00:04:44.197
I think we can believe it.

00:04:44.197 --> 00:04:45.456
But let's move on.

00:04:45.456 --> 00:04:48.899
That was just a brief word about
how you can actually apply science,

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:50.494
I would argue,

00:04:50.494 --> 00:04:52.956
to questions that are not
happening at our time,

00:04:52.956 --> 00:04:55.705
in the past, or maybe in the future.

00:04:55.705 --> 00:04:58.186
And in palaeontology,
we don't just find fossils.

00:04:58.186 --> 00:05:02.297
We also care about evolution
and diversification,

00:05:02.297 --> 00:05:05.765
how groups have become diverse,
how groups go extinct.

00:05:05.765 --> 00:05:10.499
And at the moment, we are crucially
concerned about extinction.

00:05:10.876 --> 00:05:13.185
So let's have a look at that,
let's explore that.

00:05:13.185 --> 00:05:15.016
What are the current views?

00:05:15.016 --> 00:05:17.559
And these views are expressed
not by scientists,

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:20.397
but also by very important politicians.

00:05:20.397 --> 00:05:23.774
So some of you may recall,
a number of years ago, Al Gore,

00:05:23.774 --> 00:05:26.754
who was then vice president
of the United States -

00:05:26.764 --> 00:05:32.814
He quoted a figure of 100 species
are going extinct every day.

00:05:32.814 --> 00:05:34.843
So this is a very high rate of extinction,

00:05:34.843 --> 00:05:36.663
100 per day,

00:05:36.663 --> 00:05:40.583
which is equivalent to 40,000 per year.

00:05:40.613 --> 00:05:45.272
At the other end, other politicians,
perhaps in President Trump's camp,

00:05:45.272 --> 00:05:50.393
would say, 'Don't worry about it.
Extinction happens. Look at the dinosaurs.

00:05:50.393 --> 00:05:52.217
We've got nothing to do.'

00:05:52.217 --> 00:05:55.684
So how do you connect
between these two positions

00:05:55.684 --> 00:05:58.802
because of course we have
to think about these points.

00:05:59.402 --> 00:06:03.155
The first approach that we use
is to look at history.

00:06:03.155 --> 00:06:07.194
We have recent history 
recorded of extinction.

00:06:07.194 --> 00:06:12.575
So many of you will be familiar
with the extinct bird called the dodo.

00:06:12.575 --> 00:06:17.015
This lived on the island of Mauritius
in the Indian Ocean.

00:06:17.015 --> 00:06:21.786
The dodo was a kind of fat,
flightless bird related to pigeons,

00:06:21.786 --> 00:06:23.914
and a very famous image of the dodo

00:06:23.914 --> 00:06:27.795
was in the famous children's book
'Alice in Wonderland',

00:06:27.795 --> 00:06:31.703
where the dodo, who is a wise,
old gentleman with a walking stick

00:06:31.703 --> 00:06:34.022
organises Alice and all the animals

00:06:34.022 --> 00:06:36.823
and says to them,
'We will have a Caucus race.'

00:06:36.823 --> 00:06:40.294
And a Caucus race is one
where people start when they like

00:06:40.294 --> 00:06:41.774
and they finish when they like,

00:06:41.774 --> 00:06:44.064
and everybody gets a prize.

00:06:44.064 --> 00:06:48.713
So that was very nice, but unfortunately
the dodo in real life didn't get a prize.

00:06:48.713 --> 00:06:54.144
Because some of you may know
the first records of dodos were in 1598

00:06:54.144 --> 00:06:57.044
when seamen reported
they had seen this bird.

00:06:57.044 --> 00:07:01.083
They could go on the island
and catch it very easily and eat it.

00:07:01.083 --> 00:07:04.684
And within 60 years it was extinct.

00:07:04.684 --> 00:07:08.696
Another example of recorded
extinction is the great auk.

00:07:08.696 --> 00:07:12.414
This was a large bird
that lived in the North Atlantic,

00:07:12.414 --> 00:07:16.234
and the great auk went extinct in 1844.

00:07:16.234 --> 00:07:17.624
How do we know that?

00:07:17.624 --> 00:07:22.464
Because collectors sent by a museum
shot the last example.

00:07:22.464 --> 00:07:23.552
They were concerned

00:07:23.552 --> 00:07:27.583
that their museum did not have
a stuffed specimen of this bird.

00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:29.163
They heard it was going extinct,

00:07:29.163 --> 00:07:32.638
so they thought, 'We'd better get one
before it dies out.'

00:07:32.638 --> 00:07:38.293
So these are two examples
of data about extinction.

00:07:38.313 --> 00:07:41.324
And indeed through the last 500 years,

00:07:41.324 --> 00:07:45.834
mankind has killed many species
which are recorded like that.

00:07:45.864 --> 00:07:49.103
And this is the basis of the figure
that Al Gore gave.

00:07:49.103 --> 00:07:50.655
Let me explain it.

00:07:50.655 --> 00:07:55.483
He gave that figure of 100 species
per day going extinct.

00:07:55.483 --> 00:07:57.722
This was based on the bird data.

00:07:58.002 --> 00:08:03.873
But we know something like 100 or two
or three hundred species of birds

00:08:03.873 --> 00:08:08.174
have been killed by human activity
in the last 500 years.

00:08:08.524 --> 00:08:10.775
And the figures are debated.

00:08:10.775 --> 00:08:16.452
It's something like from half a species
to four species each year on average.

00:08:16.452 --> 00:08:20.202
We don't know for sure because
of course people didn't record everything.

00:08:20.202 --> 00:08:24.303
Now, how do we scale this up
to get a global figure,

00:08:24.303 --> 00:08:27.403
from birds on the one hand to all of life?

00:08:27.403 --> 00:08:29.417
And the way it was done was simply to say,

00:08:29.417 --> 00:08:32.356
'We know how many species
or birds there are alive today.'

00:08:32.356 --> 00:08:34.573
There are 10,000,

00:08:34.573 --> 00:08:40.254
and the initial estimate for the diversity
of all of life were 100 million.

00:08:40.574 --> 00:08:44.102
So you scale from four a day upwards,

00:08:44.102 --> 00:08:46.773
and that brings you up
to this figure of 100 per day

00:08:46.773 --> 00:08:49.282
by multiplying up many times;

00:08:49.292 --> 00:08:55.525
40,000 lost per year, 100 per day,
based on that extreme high bird figure.

00:08:55.525 --> 00:08:59.536
At the other end, the lowest estimate
is something like one species per day.

00:08:59.536 --> 00:09:02.254
This is because we are not sure
about that bird figure,

00:09:02.254 --> 00:09:04.632
so we could take a lower estimate,

00:09:04.632 --> 00:09:09.514
and also we are actually not sure
about the diversity of life today either.

00:09:09.694 --> 00:09:14.565
Some of you will know that you might think
we would have named every species,

00:09:14.565 --> 00:09:16.214
we would know that - we don't.

00:09:16.214 --> 00:09:17.884
You can look at Wikipedia.

00:09:17.884 --> 00:09:21.705
There are thousands and thousands of pages
describing all the living species,

00:09:21.705 --> 00:09:24.793
but there are so many living species
that we have never discovered,

00:09:24.793 --> 00:09:26.063
never described,

00:09:26.063 --> 00:09:27.993
aren't there in Wikipedia.

00:09:28.013 --> 00:09:29.413
So there is that uncertainty.

00:09:29.413 --> 00:09:31.764
One hundred million?
Ten million? We don't know.

00:09:31.764 --> 00:09:35.335
Those are the estimates of numbers 
of species going extinct each day.

00:09:35.335 --> 00:09:37.243
One per day, one hundred per day.

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:38.913
Do we worry about that?

00:09:38.913 --> 00:09:41.312
This is where palaeontology
comes in first,

00:09:41.312 --> 00:09:43.824
because fossil data allows us

00:09:43.824 --> 00:09:47.434
to calculate what would be
the normal rate of extinction.

00:09:47.434 --> 00:09:48.924
Species do go extinct,

00:09:48.924 --> 00:09:52.374
so this politician over here
was quite right.

00:09:52.374 --> 00:09:54.322
But was Al Gore right? We don't know.

00:09:54.322 --> 00:09:57.638
You know, he was giving that high figure -
maybe somewhere in between.

00:09:57.638 --> 00:09:59.024
But what is the norm?

00:09:59.024 --> 00:10:01.893
Is one a day okay?
It doesn't sound too many.

00:10:01.893 --> 00:10:05.898
If there are millions and millions
of species, it is far too high.

00:10:05.898 --> 00:10:10.744
We know that the average duration
of a species is two million years.

00:10:10.744 --> 00:10:12.807
They originate, they go extinct.

00:10:12.807 --> 00:10:14.514
Two million years.

00:10:14.514 --> 00:10:16.613
And that means, as they come and go,

00:10:16.613 --> 00:10:21.663
on average, we would expect
the extinction of five million species

00:10:21.663 --> 00:10:23.455
every million years,

00:10:23.455 --> 00:10:27.633
which is five species per year.

00:10:27.633 --> 00:10:32.843
So that does contrast remarkably even
at the lowest estimate of human impact -

00:10:32.843 --> 00:10:38.974
500 species per year is 100 times
the normal rate of 5 per year.

00:10:38.974 --> 00:10:40.712
And at the bottom there is the dodo,

00:10:40.712 --> 00:10:43.272
just in case you weren't sure
what it looked like.

00:10:43.272 --> 00:10:47.147
So I want to look
at two other topics briefly.

00:10:47.327 --> 00:10:48.822
One is risk.

00:10:48.822 --> 00:10:53.317
And so, one of the questions we would have
estimating the total numbers is one thing.

00:10:53.317 --> 00:10:57.356
We have learned that we are impacting life
harder than we should be.

00:10:57.356 --> 00:10:59.603
Human activity is causing extinction.

00:11:00.013 --> 00:11:01.082
What about risk?

00:11:01.082 --> 00:11:03.353
It's easy to say of course,
the dodo was stupid,

00:11:03.353 --> 00:11:05.274
it lived on one island,

00:11:05.274 --> 00:11:08.901
it just stood around and allowed itself
to be hit on the head.

00:11:09.171 --> 00:11:10.513
To an extent.

00:11:10.513 --> 00:11:12.933
We worry about elephants,
we worry about pandas,

00:11:12.933 --> 00:11:15.633
we worry about many individual species.

00:11:15.653 --> 00:11:18.597
Many of those have high-risk factors.

00:11:18.597 --> 00:11:21.173
So for example, an elephant is very large.

00:11:21.173 --> 00:11:23.033
This means they need a lot of food,

00:11:23.033 --> 00:11:26.145
they need a lot of territory
to walk around.

00:11:26.145 --> 00:11:27.692
And so it's much harder

00:11:27.692 --> 00:11:32.277
to keep a sufficiently large
population of elephants breeding

00:11:32.277 --> 00:11:34.542
and successfully in the wild.

00:11:34.542 --> 00:11:36.863
We don't need to worry
about rats, for example.

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:38.913
They're small and there's lots of them.

00:11:38.913 --> 00:11:41.260
So body size is one risk factor.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.543
Being big is not a good thing
if you want to survive as a species.

00:11:45.543 --> 00:11:47.214
What about the panda?

00:11:47.214 --> 00:11:49.746
They're not so huge.
They're about human size.

00:11:50.046 --> 00:11:52.284
They have a specialised diet.

00:11:52.914 --> 00:11:55.477
They have evolved into a crazy position.

00:11:55.477 --> 00:11:57.575
As you know, they are eating bamboo

00:11:57.575 --> 00:12:00.964
without the real ability
to consume it properly.

00:12:00.964 --> 00:12:03.152
If that food supply disappears,

00:12:03.152 --> 00:12:04.202
they're stuck.

00:12:04.202 --> 00:12:07.813
So, secondly, restricted
diet is a problem.

00:12:08.083 --> 00:12:09.933
The third one is shown by the dodo.

00:12:09.933 --> 00:12:13.433
If you live in only a very
small geographic area

00:12:13.433 --> 00:12:15.353
rather than over the whole world,

00:12:15.353 --> 00:12:16.734
you are at risk.

00:12:16.734 --> 00:12:18.923
So there are three things to be:

00:12:18.923 --> 00:12:22.442
medium-sized or small,
if you want to survive;

00:12:22.442 --> 00:12:24.917
broad diet, willing to eat everything;

00:12:24.917 --> 00:12:26.974
and living over the whole world.

00:12:26.974 --> 00:12:30.777
So that includes human beings
and rats and cockroaches.

00:12:30.777 --> 00:12:36.133
They will survive and many other species
will not survive whatever we do.

00:12:36.133 --> 00:12:39.186
So risk is something we can 
determine from the present day,

00:12:39.186 --> 00:12:43.142
but also we can test when we look
at mass extinctions in the past.

00:12:43.172 --> 00:12:45.522
So this is where 
we come back to palaeontology,

00:12:45.522 --> 00:12:47.933
because I think most people here know

00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:52.002
that the end of the dinosaurs 
was marked by a mass extinction.

00:12:52.002 --> 00:12:57.038
Many millions or thousands 
of species died out rather rapidly.

00:12:57.058 --> 00:13:02.572
The cause of that extinction definitely
was largely the impact of a meteorite,

00:13:02.572 --> 00:13:04.419
a huge asteroid,

00:13:04.419 --> 00:13:06.779
maybe ten kilometres across,

00:13:06.779 --> 00:13:11.253
and the model for extinction 
of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago

00:13:11.253 --> 00:13:12.852
was the asteroid hit the Earth -

00:13:12.852 --> 00:13:16.462
this is unpredictable,
when this may happen or not -

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:18.788
it penetrated into the crust,

00:13:18.788 --> 00:13:20.553
it vaporised,

00:13:20.553 --> 00:13:24.893
and all that rock of the asteroid
plus the crust that it had penetrated

00:13:24.893 --> 00:13:27.543
turned into rocks and dust, mainly dust.

00:13:27.543 --> 00:13:29.693
This was thrown up high
into the atmosphere

00:13:29.693 --> 00:13:33.003
and went all round the Earth,
blacking out the sun,

00:13:33.003 --> 00:13:36.556
and so that you get two effects
there, no light, no heat.

00:13:36.556 --> 00:13:39.422
So there was a cessation 
of photosynthesis.

00:13:39.422 --> 00:13:42.415
The plants died.
There was darkness and cold.

00:13:42.415 --> 00:13:44.343
So this was not good for dinosaurs

00:13:44.343 --> 00:13:47.773
and other groups that enjoyed
the warm climates,

00:13:47.773 --> 00:13:49.383
and so you get extinction.

00:13:49.383 --> 00:13:52.248
And you might think, of course,
'What do we learn from this?'

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:56.803
Yes, that's all very well, but that's not 
something we can do anything about really.

00:13:56.803 --> 00:14:00.382
And indeed, asteroids do come close
to the Earth from time to time.

00:14:00.382 --> 00:14:04.134
Earlier this week, one did.
Luckily it didn't hit the Earth.

00:14:04.624 --> 00:14:06.466
We can't really prepare.

00:14:06.466 --> 00:14:10.343
But the key point is that the other
mass extinctions in the history of life

00:14:10.343 --> 00:14:12.503
were not caused by impact.

00:14:12.503 --> 00:14:15.133
They were caused by climate change.

00:14:15.133 --> 00:14:18.773
Immediately, you can see now
how that matters.

00:14:18.773 --> 00:14:21.903
I will briefly characterise one of them
that I have worked upon.

00:14:21.903 --> 00:14:25.583
At the end of the Permian Period,
250 million years ago,

00:14:25.583 --> 00:14:27.255
there was another major extinction.

00:14:27.255 --> 00:14:29.386
This was before the dinosaurs.

00:14:29.386 --> 00:14:34.293
And the sequence of events was 
that massive volcanoes errupted in Russia.

00:14:34.593 --> 00:14:39.445
They were so huge that they poured out
enormous amounts of lava, of course,

00:14:39.445 --> 00:14:43.503
but more importantly, they poured out
gases into the atmosphere,

00:14:43.503 --> 00:14:45.783
including carbon dioxide.

00:14:46.143 --> 00:14:50.863
And carbon dioxide is famous
as a greenhouse gas,

00:14:50.863 --> 00:14:52.844
meaning it heats the atmosphere.

00:14:52.844 --> 00:14:55.462
We have primary evidence
that around the equator,

00:14:55.462 --> 00:14:59.863
ocean temperatures 
warmed up to 40 degrees plus.

00:14:59.863 --> 00:15:02.213
So this is like a very warm shower.

00:15:02.213 --> 00:15:04.303
You might think that's OK.

00:15:04.303 --> 00:15:08.843
Maybe for 10 minutes
but not for day after day after day.

00:15:08.843 --> 00:15:12.873
And so life had to progressively
flee out of the equatorial zones.

00:15:12.873 --> 00:15:16.561
It became crowded at the poles
and there was great extinction.

00:15:16.561 --> 00:15:17.932
So we learnt from that

00:15:17.932 --> 00:15:21.440
that carbon dioxide and global warming
can cause extinction

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.773
whatever the cause of that carbon dioxide,

00:15:23.773 --> 00:15:26.804
whether it comes from volcanoes
or human activity.

00:15:26.804 --> 00:15:28.254
So we've learnt three things

00:15:28.254 --> 00:15:32.023
that we can illustrate
and use for predicting into the future,

00:15:32.023 --> 00:15:34.143
what may happen to life.

00:15:34.143 --> 00:15:36.833
We've learnt that we can
calculate the rate of extinction

00:15:36.833 --> 00:15:39.344
by looking at historical extinctions

00:15:39.344 --> 00:15:43.013
and at that rate of extinction,
even at the minimal figures,

00:15:43.013 --> 00:15:46.971
it's at least one hundred times
what it ought to be.

00:15:47.191 --> 00:15:49.793
Secondly, we've learnt
something about risk,

00:15:49.793 --> 00:15:52.242
which species are
most at risk of extinction,

00:15:52.242 --> 00:15:54.733
and I think that's fairly straightforward.

00:15:54.733 --> 00:15:58.733
But we need the evidence
to be able to argue the case.

00:15:58.733 --> 00:16:01.666
And thirdly, we've learnt 
that the whole history of the Earth

00:16:01.666 --> 00:16:05.303
records a rich record of climate change.

00:16:05.303 --> 00:16:08.443
We don't need to do experiments,
we don't need to imagine

00:16:08.443 --> 00:16:12.123
what a world would be like
without the polar ice caps.

00:16:12.123 --> 00:16:14.767
It has existed and we can study it.

00:16:15.737 --> 00:16:20.984
So to conclude, my aim has not been
simply to spread doom and gloom,

00:16:20.984 --> 00:16:24.524
but to indicate that we have
the power to change.

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:28.124
And in order to change,
we have to accept reality

00:16:28.124 --> 00:16:30.095
along the lines that we're mentioning.

00:16:30.095 --> 00:16:33.833
And we have to ask the right questions
about what we should do.

00:16:33.833 --> 00:16:38.642
And in order to decide what we should do,
we need to use evidence.

00:16:38.642 --> 00:16:41.733
And some great evidence comes
from the history of the Earth

00:16:41.733 --> 00:16:43.102
and the history of life.

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:44.423
Thank you very much.

00:16:44.423 --> 00:16:46.159
(Applause)
