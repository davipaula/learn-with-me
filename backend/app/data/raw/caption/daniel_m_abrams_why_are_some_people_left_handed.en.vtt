00:00:06.674 --> 00:00:09.301
If you know an older left-handed person,

00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:14.103
chances are they had to learn to write
or eat with their right hand.

00:00:14.103 --> 00:00:15.635
And in many parts of the world,

00:00:15.635 --> 00:00:20.036
it's still common practice to force
children to use their "proper" hand.

00:00:20.615 --> 00:00:24.378
Even the word for right
also means correct or good,

00:00:24.378 --> 00:00:27.557
not just in English,
but many other languages, too.

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.838
But if being left-handed is so wrong,

00:00:30.838 --> 00:00:32.962
then why does it happen
in the first place?

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:37.618
Today, about 1/10 of the world's
population are left-handed.

00:00:37.618 --> 00:00:40.127
Archeological evidence shows
that it's been that way

00:00:40.127 --> 00:00:43.400
for as long as 500,000 years,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.216
with about 10% of human remains

00:00:45.216 --> 00:00:49.925
showing the associated differences
in arm length and bone density,

00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:54.542
and some ancient tools and artifacts
showing evidence of left-hand use.

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:59.496
And despite what many may think,
handedness is not a choice.

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:04.175
It can be predicted even before birth
based on the fetus' position in the womb.

00:01:04.861 --> 00:01:08.349
So, if handedness is inborn,
does that mean it's genetic?

00:01:08.823 --> 00:01:10.127
Well, yes and no.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.294
Identical twins, who have the same genes,
can have different dominant hands.

00:01:15.294 --> 00:01:19.357
In fact, this happens as often as it does
with any other sibling pair.

00:01:20.185 --> 00:01:22.689
But the chances of being
right or left-handed

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.810
are determined by the handedness
of your parents

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.639
in surprisingly consistent ratios.

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:31.947
If your father was left-handed
but your mother was right-handed,

00:01:31.947 --> 00:01:36.063
you have a 17% chance
of being born left-handed,

00:01:36.063 --> 00:01:39.769
while two righties will have
a left-handed child only 10% of the time.

00:01:40.522 --> 00:01:43.678
Handedness seems to be determined
by a roll of the dice,

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:45.811
but the odds are set by your genes.

00:01:46.354 --> 00:01:48.077
All of this implies there's a reason

00:01:48.077 --> 00:01:51.582
that evolution has produced
this small proportion of lefties,

00:01:51.582 --> 00:01:53.821
and maintained it
over the course of millennia.

00:01:54.236 --> 00:01:56.304
And while there have been several theories

00:01:56.304 --> 00:01:59.830
attempting to explain why handedness
exists in the first place,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.928
or why most people are right-handed,

00:02:01.928 --> 00:02:03.434
a recent mathematical model

00:02:03.434 --> 00:02:06.899
suggests that the actual ratio
reflects a balance

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.181
between competitive and cooperative
pressures on human evolution.

00:02:11.697 --> 00:02:13.489
The benefits of being left-handed

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.409
are clearest in activities
involving an opponent,

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.205
like combat or competitive sports.

00:02:20.205 --> 00:02:25.285
For example, about 50% of top hitters
in baseball have been left-handed.

00:02:25.285 --> 00:02:26.286
Why?

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.278
Think of it as a surprise advantage.

00:02:28.836 --> 00:02:31.584
Because lefties are a minority
to begin with,

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:34.220
both right-handed
and left-handed competitors

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.846
will spend most of their time
encountering

00:02:36.846 --> 00:02:39.679
and practicing against righties.

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:41.223
So when the two face each other,

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:45.430
the left-hander will be better prepared
against this right-handed opponent,

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.577
while the righty will be thrown off.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.897
This fighting hypothesis,

00:02:49.897 --> 00:02:51.699
where an imbalance in the population

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:55.228
results in an advantage for left-handed
fighters or athletes,

00:02:55.228 --> 00:02:58.787
is an example of negative
frequency-dependent selection.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.599
But according to the principles
of evolution,

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.361
groups that have a relative advantage

00:03:03.385 --> 00:03:06.556
tend to grow until
that advantage disappears.

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.553
If people were only fighting and competing
throughout human evolution,

00:03:10.553 --> 00:03:14.434
natural selection would lead to more
lefties being the ones that made it

00:03:14.434 --> 00:03:16.014
until there were so many of them,

00:03:16.014 --> 00:03:18.438
that it was no longer a rare asset.

00:03:18.962 --> 00:03:21.094
So in a purely competitive world,

00:03:21.094 --> 00:03:23.731
50% of the population
would be left-handed.

00:03:24.345 --> 00:03:29.068
But human evolution has been shaped
by cooperation, as well as competition.

00:03:29.068 --> 00:03:30.223
And cooperative pressure

00:03:30.223 --> 00:03:33.627
pushes handedness distribution
in the opposite direction.

00:03:34.786 --> 00:03:38.449
In golf, where performance
doesn't depend on the opponent,

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.562
only 4% of top players are left-handed,

00:03:41.562 --> 00:03:44.620
an example of the wider phenomenon
of tool sharing.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.338
Just as young potential golfers

00:03:47.338 --> 00:03:50.489
can more easily find
a set of right-handed clubs,

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.796
many of the important instruments
that have shaped society

00:03:53.796 --> 00:03:56.945
were designed for
the right-handed majority.

00:03:56.945 --> 00:03:59.227
Because lefties are worse
at using these tools,

00:03:59.227 --> 00:04:01.737
and suffer from higher accident rates,

00:04:01.737 --> 00:04:04.913
they would be less successful
in a purely cooperative world,

00:04:04.913 --> 00:04:08.251
eventually disappearing
from the population.

00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:10.251
So by correctly predicting
the distribution

00:04:10.275 --> 00:04:12.846
of left-handed people
in the general population,

00:04:12.846 --> 00:04:15.653
as well as matching data
from various sports,

00:04:15.653 --> 00:04:16.699
the model indicates

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.499
that the persistence of lefties
as a small but stable minority

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:22.458
reflects an equilibrium

00:04:22.458 --> 00:04:24.990
that comes from competitive
and cooperative effects

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.071
playing out simultaneously over time.

00:04:28.071 --> 00:04:29.738
And the most intriguing thing

00:04:29.738 --> 00:04:33.477
is what the numbers can tell us
about various populations.

00:04:33.477 --> 00:04:37.457
From the skewed distribution of pawedness
in cooperative animals,

00:04:37.457 --> 00:04:39.666
to the slightly larger
percentage of lefties

00:04:39.666 --> 00:04:42.592
in competitive hunter-gatherer societies,

00:04:42.592 --> 00:04:47.636
we may even find that the answers
to some puzzles of early human evolution

00:04:47.636 --> 00:04:49.639
are already in our hands.
