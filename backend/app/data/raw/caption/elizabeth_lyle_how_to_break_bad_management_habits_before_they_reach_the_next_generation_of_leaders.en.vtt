00:00:13.002 --> 00:00:15.837
I am guilty of stacking
my dishes in the sink

00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:17.782
and leaving them there for hours.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.600
I fact-checked this with my boyfriend.

00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:23.251
He says it's less like hours
and more like days,

00:00:23.275 --> 00:00:24.496
but that's not the point.

00:00:25.035 --> 00:00:27.909
The point is sometimes
I don't finish the job

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:31.743
until the stack has gotten high enough
that it's peaking over the lip of the sink

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:33.524
and my inner clean freak loses it.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.172
This charming habit developed
when I was in college,

00:00:37.196 --> 00:00:38.460
and I had tons of excuses.

00:00:39.117 --> 00:00:40.489
"I'm running to class!"

00:00:40.513 --> 00:00:42.604
"What's one more dirty dish in the sink?"

00:00:42.628 --> 00:00:46.184
Or my favorite, "I think
I can save time and water

00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:48.510
if I do them all together later."

00:00:48.534 --> 00:00:49.598
(Laughter)

00:00:49.622 --> 00:00:53.294
But it's not like I needed those excuses,
because nobody was calling me on it.

00:00:54.132 --> 00:00:55.282
I wish they had.

00:00:55.673 --> 00:00:56.824
I look back now

00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:59.897
and realize that every time
I didn't put a dish in the dishwasher

00:00:59.921 --> 00:01:01.190
and finish what I started,

00:01:01.214 --> 00:01:03.146
it became more second nature to me,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.777
and I grew less likely
to question why I was doing it.

00:01:06.352 --> 00:01:10.384
Today, I'm a 30-something,
certified dirty-dish leaver,

00:01:10.408 --> 00:01:12.257
and breaking this habit is hard.

00:01:13.497 --> 00:01:16.276
So when I'm not at home avoiding the sink,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.183
I work with large, complex organizations
on leadership transformation

00:01:20.207 --> 00:01:21.470
in times of change.

00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:25.018
My job is to work
with the most senior leaders

00:01:25.042 --> 00:01:26.605
to examine how they lead today

00:01:26.629 --> 00:01:29.214
and establish habits
better suited for the future.

00:01:30.293 --> 00:01:33.119
But what interests me more
than senior leaders these days

00:01:33.143 --> 00:01:35.074
is what's going on with the junior ones.

00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:37.450
We call them "middle managers,"

00:01:37.474 --> 00:01:39.340
but it's a term I wish we could change

00:01:39.364 --> 00:01:42.969
because what they are is our pipeline
of future talent for the C-suite,

00:01:42.993 --> 00:01:45.626
and they are starting to leave
their dishes in the sink.

00:01:46.353 --> 00:01:48.955
While organizations
are hiring people like me

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.772
to redevelop their senior
leaders for the future,

00:01:51.796 --> 00:01:55.189
outdated leadership habits
are forming right before our eyes

00:01:55.213 --> 00:01:58.060
among the middle managers
who will one day take their place.

00:01:59.488 --> 00:02:03.752
We need middle managers
and senior leaders to work together,

00:02:03.776 --> 00:02:05.802
because this is a big problem.

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:09.216
Organizations are evolving rapidly,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.295
and they're counting
on their future leaders

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.468
to lead with more speed, flexibility,
trust and cooperation than they do today.

00:02:18.622 --> 00:02:22.106
I believe there is a window of time
in the formative middle-manager years

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.893
when we can lay the groundwork
for that kind of leadership,

00:02:24.917 --> 00:02:26.273
but we're missing it.

00:02:26.297 --> 00:02:27.536
Why?

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.664
Because our future leaders
are learning from senior role models

00:02:30.688 --> 00:02:32.781
who just aren't ready to role model yet,

00:02:32.805 --> 00:02:36.351
much less change the systems
that made them so successful.

00:02:37.637 --> 00:02:40.414
We need middle managers
and senior leaders to work together

00:02:40.438 --> 00:02:41.979
to define a new way of leading

00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:44.436
and develop each other
to rise to the occasion.

00:02:45.946 --> 00:02:47.774
One of my favorite senior clients --

00:02:47.798 --> 00:02:49.050
we'll call her Jane --

00:02:49.074 --> 00:02:52.219
is a poster child for what's
old-fashioned in leadership today.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.033
She rose to her C-level position

00:02:55.057 --> 00:02:57.851
based on exceptional
individual performance.

00:02:57.875 --> 00:03:00.977
Come hell or high water,
Jane got the job done,

00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:03.203
and today, she leads like it.

00:03:03.545 --> 00:03:05.125
She is tough to please,

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:08.631
she doesn't have a lot of time
for things that's aren't mission-critical,

00:03:08.641 --> 00:03:11.714
and she really doesn't trust
anyone's judgment more than her own.

00:03:11.738 --> 00:03:14.678
Needless to say,
Jane's in behavior boot camp.

00:03:15.693 --> 00:03:17.392
Those deeply ingrained habits

00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:20.912
are deeply inconsistent
with where her organization is heading.

00:03:21.348 --> 00:03:24.302
The command-and-control behavior
that she was once rewarded for

00:03:24.326 --> 00:03:25.967
just isn't going to work

00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:29.992
in a faster-moving, flatter, more
digitally interconnected organization.

00:03:30.446 --> 00:03:32.828
What got her here won't get her there.

00:03:34.348 --> 00:03:35.812
But I want to talk about John,

00:03:35.836 --> 00:03:38.995
a supertalented, up-and-coming
manager who works for Jane,

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.206
because her habits are rubbing off on him.

00:03:41.968 --> 00:03:44.176
Recently, he and I were strategizing

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.557
about a decision we needed to put
in front of the CEO, Jane's boss,

00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:49.084
and the rest of Jane's peers.

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:52.958
He said to me, "Liz,
you're not going to like this,

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:55.062
but the way decisions
get made around here

00:03:55.086 --> 00:03:57.389
is with a bunch of meetings
before the meeting."

00:03:58.223 --> 00:03:59.602
I counted.

00:03:59.626 --> 00:04:03.197
That was going to mean
eight one-on-ones, exec by exec,

00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:06.189
to make sure each one of them
was individually on board enough

00:04:06.213 --> 00:04:08.761
that things would go smoothly
in the actual meeting.

00:04:10.356 --> 00:04:13.381
He promised, "It's not how
we'll do things in the future,

00:04:13.405 --> 00:04:15.335
but it's how we have to do them today."

00:04:16.504 --> 00:04:18.362
John wasn't wrong on either count.

00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:21.300
Meetings before the meeting
are a necessary evil

00:04:21.324 --> 00:04:22.475
in his company today,

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:24.014
and I didn't like it at all.

00:04:24.739 --> 00:04:28.148
Sure, it was going
to be inefficient and annoying,

00:04:28.172 --> 00:04:30.356
but what bothered me most
was his confidence

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.748
that it's not how
they'll do things in the future.

00:04:33.323 --> 00:04:34.663
How could he be sure?

00:04:35.263 --> 00:04:38.923
Who was going to change it and when,
if it wasn't him and now?

00:04:39.994 --> 00:04:41.349
What would the trigger be?

00:04:41.373 --> 00:04:42.616
And when it happened,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.499
would he even know how to have
effective meetings without pre-meetings?

00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:49.707
He was confidently implying
that when he's the boss,

00:04:49.731 --> 00:04:52.239
he'll change the rules
and do things differently,

00:04:52.263 --> 00:04:55.256
but all I could see were dishes
stacking in the sink

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.184
and a guy with a lot of good excuses.

00:04:57.793 --> 00:05:00.722
Worse, a guy who might be
out of a job one day

00:05:00.746 --> 00:05:02.948
because he learned too late how to lead

00:05:02.972 --> 00:05:04.760
in the organizations of tomorrow.

00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:09.026
These stories really get to me

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.196
when it's the fast-track,
high-potential managers like John

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.455
because they're probably
the most capable of making waves

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.448
and redefining how leaders
lead from the inside.

00:05:18.472 --> 00:05:22.861
But what we find is that they're often
doing the best job at not rocking the boat

00:05:22.885 --> 00:05:25.090
and challenging the system

00:05:25.114 --> 00:05:26.734
because they're trying to impress

00:05:26.758 --> 00:05:29.943
and make life easier on the senior leaders
who will promote them.

00:05:30.515 --> 00:05:32.707
As someone who also likes to get promoted,

00:05:32.731 --> 00:05:34.227
I can hardly blame him.

00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:35.710
It's a catch-22.

00:05:36.617 --> 00:05:38.548
But they're also so self-assured

00:05:38.572 --> 00:05:40.731
that they'll be able
to change their behavior

00:05:40.755 --> 00:05:43.518
once they've earned the authority
to do things differently,

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:44.941
and that is a trap.

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:47.960
Because if I've learned anything
from working with Jane,

00:05:47.984 --> 00:05:49.596
it's that when that day comes,

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.597
John will wonder how he could
possibly do anything differently

00:05:52.621 --> 00:05:55.727
in his high-stakes,
high-pressure executive job

00:05:55.751 --> 00:05:59.307
without risking his own success
and the organization's,

00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:03.128
and he'll wish it didn't feel
so safe and so easy

00:06:03.152 --> 00:06:06.021
to keep doing things
the way they've always been done.

00:06:07.353 --> 00:06:10.346
So the leadership development
expert in me asks:

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.216
How can we better intervene
in the formative years

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.977
of our soon-to-be senior leaders?

00:06:15.825 --> 00:06:19.523
How can we use the fact that John
and his peers want to take charge

00:06:19.547 --> 00:06:21.213
of their professional destinies

00:06:21.237 --> 00:06:24.264
and get them ready to lead
the organizations of the future,

00:06:24.288 --> 00:06:27.155
rather than let them
succumb to the catch-22

00:06:27.179 --> 00:06:31.272
that will perfectly prepare them
to lead the organizations of the past?

00:06:32.956 --> 00:06:36.053
We'll have to start by coming to terms
with a very real paradox,

00:06:36.077 --> 00:06:37.367
which is this:

00:06:37.391 --> 00:06:39.791
the best form of learning
happens on the job --

00:06:39.815 --> 00:06:42.438
not in a classroom, not via e-modules.

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:46.282
And the two things we rely on
to shape on-the-job learning

00:06:46.306 --> 00:06:48.943
are role models and work environments.

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:50.999
And as we just talked about,

00:06:51.023 --> 00:06:54.665
our role models are in behavior
boot camp right now,

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:58.853
and our work environments
are undergoing unprecedented disruption.

00:06:58.877 --> 00:07:02.113
We are systematically changing
just about everything

00:07:02.137 --> 00:07:04.176
about how organizations work,

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.514
but by and large, still measuring
and rewarding behavior

00:07:07.538 --> 00:07:09.307
based on old metrics,

00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:11.460
because changing those systems takes time.

00:07:12.113 --> 00:07:17.896
So, if we can't fully count on role models
or the system right now,

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.258
it's on John to not miss
this critical development window.

00:07:21.817 --> 00:07:24.381
Yes, he'll need Jane's help to do it,

00:07:24.405 --> 00:07:28.166
but the responsibility is his
because the risks are actually his.

00:07:28.582 --> 00:07:31.921
Either he inherits
an organization that is failing

00:07:31.945 --> 00:07:34.667
because of stubbornly
old-fashioned leadership,

00:07:34.691 --> 00:07:38.338
or he himself fails to build
the capabilities to lead one

00:07:38.362 --> 00:07:40.965
that transformed
while he was playing it safe.

00:07:42.677 --> 00:07:45.933
So now the question is,
where does John start?

00:07:47.114 --> 00:07:50.372
If I were John, I'd ask
to start flying the plane.

00:07:51.474 --> 00:07:54.865
For my 13th birthday,
my grandpa, a former Navy pilot,

00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:57.949
gave me the gift of being able
to fly a very small plane.

00:07:59.433 --> 00:08:01.376
Once we were safely airborne,

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.205
the pilot turned over the controls,
folded his hands,

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:05.661
and he let me fly.

00:08:07.016 --> 00:08:08.510
It was totally terrifying.

00:08:09.215 --> 00:08:13.588
It was exhilarating, but it was also
on-the-job learning with a safety net.

00:08:14.106 --> 00:08:15.793
And because it was real,

00:08:15.817 --> 00:08:17.880
I really learned how to do it myself.

00:08:19.017 --> 00:08:22.398
Likewise, in the workplace,
every meeting to be led,

00:08:22.422 --> 00:08:23.919
every decision to be made

00:08:23.943 --> 00:08:25.354
can be a practice flight

00:08:25.378 --> 00:08:27.999
for someone who could really
use the learning experience

00:08:28.023 --> 00:08:30.909
and the chance to figure out
how to do it their own way.

00:08:31.412 --> 00:08:35.400
So instead of caving,
John needs to knock on Jane's door,

00:08:35.424 --> 00:08:37.075
propose a creative strategy

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:40.363
for having the meeting
without the eight pre-meetings,

00:08:40.387 --> 00:08:43.099
show her he's thought
through the trade-offs

00:08:43.123 --> 00:08:45.417
and ask for her support
to do it differently.

00:08:47.117 --> 00:08:48.923
This isn't going to be easy for Jane.

00:08:49.772 --> 00:08:52.572
Not only does she need to trust John,

00:08:52.596 --> 00:08:58.089
she needs to accept that with a little bit
of room to try his hand at leading,

00:08:58.113 --> 00:09:00.684
John will inevitably start
leading in some ways

00:09:00.708 --> 00:09:03.399
that are far more John than Jane.

00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:06.527
And this won't be an indictment of her.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.955
Rather, it will be individualism.

00:09:08.979 --> 00:09:10.325
It will be progress.

00:09:10.349 --> 00:09:13.368
And it might even be a chance
for Jane to learn a thing or two

00:09:13.392 --> 00:09:15.799
to take her own leadership game
to the next level.

00:09:17.678 --> 00:09:21.059
I work with another senior client
who summed up this dilemma beautifully

00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:23.289
when we were talking
about why he and his peers

00:09:23.313 --> 00:09:26.718
haven't empowered the folks below them
with more decision rights.

00:09:26.742 --> 00:09:27.892
He said,

00:09:28.925 --> 00:09:31.117
"We haven't done it
because we just don't trust

00:09:31.141 --> 00:09:33.586
that they're going to make
the right decisions.

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.341
But then again, how could they?

00:09:35.365 --> 00:09:37.987
We've just never given them
decisions to practice with."

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:42.533
So I'm not advocating that Jane
hands over the controls

00:09:42.557 --> 00:09:44.647
and folds her hands indefinitely,

00:09:44.671 --> 00:09:45.848
but what I am saying

00:09:45.872 --> 00:09:48.444
is that if she doesn't engineer
learning and practice

00:09:48.468 --> 00:09:50.831
right into John's day today,

00:09:50.855 --> 00:09:53.181
he'll never be able to do what she does,

00:09:53.205 --> 00:09:56.142
much less do it any differently
than she does it.

00:09:57.534 --> 00:10:01.615
Finally, since we're going to be pushing
both of them outside their comfort zones,

00:10:01.639 --> 00:10:03.053
we need some outside coaches

00:10:03.077 --> 00:10:06.135
to make sure this isn't a case
of the blind leading the blind.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.095
But what if instead of using coaches

00:10:09.119 --> 00:10:12.508
to coach each one of them
to individually be more effective,

00:10:12.532 --> 00:10:15.498
we started coaching
the interactions between them?

00:10:16.114 --> 00:10:18.287
If I could wave my magic wand,

00:10:18.311 --> 00:10:21.074
I would have coaches sitting
in the occasional team meeting

00:10:21.098 --> 00:10:22.962
of Jane and her direct reports,

00:10:22.986 --> 00:10:26.565
debriefing solely
on how well they cooperated that day.

00:10:27.646 --> 00:10:32.435
I would put a coach in the periodic
feedback session between Jane and John,

00:10:32.459 --> 00:10:35.595
and just like a couples' therapist
coaches on communication,

00:10:35.619 --> 00:10:37.753
they would offer advice and observations

00:10:37.777 --> 00:10:40.412
on how that conversation
can go better in the future.

00:10:41.021 --> 00:10:44.065
Was Jane simply reinforcing
what Jane would have done?

00:10:44.089 --> 00:10:45.739
Or was Jane really helping John

00:10:45.763 --> 00:10:48.657
think through what to do
for the organization?

00:10:49.174 --> 00:10:51.710
That is seriously hard
mentorship to provide,

00:10:51.734 --> 00:10:54.220
and even the best leaders
need help doing it,

00:10:54.244 --> 00:10:57.548
which is why we need more coaches
coaching more leaders,

00:10:57.572 --> 00:10:59.127
more in real time

00:10:59.151 --> 00:11:01.823
versus any one leader behind closed doors.

00:11:03.649 --> 00:11:07.161
Around 20 years ago,
Warren Buffet gave a school lecture

00:11:07.185 --> 00:11:11.704
in which he said, "The chains
of habit are too light to be felt

00:11:11.728 --> 00:11:14.312
until they're too heavy to be broken."

00:11:15.061 --> 00:11:16.546
I couldn't agree more,

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:19.961
and I see it happening
with our future leaders in training.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:25.333
Can we and they be doing more
to build their leadership capabilities

00:11:25.357 --> 00:11:27.560
while they're still open, eager

00:11:27.584 --> 00:11:32.243
and not too far gone down a path
of bad habits we totally saw coming?

00:11:33.377 --> 00:11:36.470
I wish my college roommates
and I called each other out back then

00:11:36.494 --> 00:11:37.735
for the dishes.

00:11:37.759 --> 00:11:41.542
It would have been so much easier
to nip that habit in the bud

00:11:41.566 --> 00:11:43.280
than it is to change it today.

00:11:43.841 --> 00:11:47.586
But I still believe in a future for myself
full of gleaming sinks

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:48.975
and busy dishwashers,

00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:50.367
and so we're working on it,

00:11:50.391 --> 00:11:53.620
every day, together, moment to moment,

00:11:53.644 --> 00:11:55.295
one dirty dish at a time.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.151
Thank you.

00:11:57.175 --> 00:12:02.096
