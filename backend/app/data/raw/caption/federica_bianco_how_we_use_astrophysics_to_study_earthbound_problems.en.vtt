00:00:13.317 --> 00:00:15.809
I am an astrophysicist.

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:18.888
I research stellar explosions
across the universe.

00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:20.803
But I have a flaw:

00:00:21.325 --> 00:00:23.808
I'm restless, and I get bored easily.

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:27.552
And although as an astrophysicist,
I have the incredible opportunity

00:00:27.576 --> 00:00:29.508
to study the entire universe,

00:00:29.532 --> 00:00:32.880
the thought of doing
only that, always that,

00:00:32.904 --> 00:00:35.135
makes me feel caged and limited.

00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:40.676
What if my issues with
keeping attention and getting bored

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.182
were not a flaw, though?

00:00:42.206 --> 00:00:44.873
What if I could turn them into an asset?

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.475
An astrophysicist cannot
touch or interact with

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:50.037
the things that she studies.

00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:53.774
No way to explode a star in a lab
to figure out why or how it blew up.

00:00:54.164 --> 00:00:56.694
Just pictures and movies of the sky.

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.560
Everything we know about the universe,

00:00:59.584 --> 00:01:02.675
from the big bang
that originated space and time,

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.493
to the formation and evolution
of stars and galaxies,

00:01:05.517 --> 00:01:07.977
to the structure of our own solar system,

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.801
we figured out studying images of the sky.

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:15.958
And to study a system
as complex as the entire universe,

00:01:15.982 --> 00:01:20.687
astrophysicists are experts
at extracting simple models and solutions

00:01:20.711 --> 00:01:23.050
from large and complex data sets.

00:01:23.705 --> 00:01:26.130
So what else can I do with this expertise?

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.125
What if we turned the camera
around towards us?

00:01:33.057 --> 00:01:36.048
At the Urban Observatory,
that is exactly what we are doing.

00:01:36.072 --> 00:01:38.564
Greg Dobler, also an astrophysicist

00:01:38.588 --> 00:01:39.755
and my husband,

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:43.739
created the first urban observatory
in New York University in 2013,

00:01:43.763 --> 00:01:45.319
and I joined in 2015.

00:01:45.752 --> 00:01:47.681
Here are some of the things that we do.

00:01:48.196 --> 00:01:50.466
We take pictures of the city at night

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.079
and study city lights like stars.

00:01:53.514 --> 00:01:55.526
By studying how light changes over time

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.624
and the color of astronomical lights,

00:01:57.648 --> 00:02:00.461
I gain insight about the nature
of exploding stars.

00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:03.204
By studying city lights the same way,

00:02:03.228 --> 00:02:07.910
we can measure and predict how much energy
the city needs and consumes

00:02:07.934 --> 00:02:09.781
and help build a resilient grid

00:02:09.805 --> 00:02:13.104
that will support the needs
of growing urban environments.

00:02:14.283 --> 00:02:17.640
In daytime images,
we capture plumes of pollution.

00:02:18.274 --> 00:02:21.744
Seventy-five percent
of greenhouse gases in New York City

00:02:21.768 --> 00:02:25.400
come from a building like this one,
burning oil for heat.

00:02:26.477 --> 00:02:28.872
You can measure pollution
with air quality sensors.

00:02:28.896 --> 00:02:32.738
But imagine putting a sensor
on each New York City building,

00:02:32.762 --> 00:02:35.468
reading in data from a million monitors.

00:02:35.492 --> 00:02:36.818
Imagine the cost.

00:02:38.048 --> 00:02:41.476
With a team of NYU students,
we built a mathematical model,

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.889
a neural network that can detect
and track these plumes

00:02:44.913 --> 00:02:46.603
over the New York City skyline.

00:02:46.627 --> 00:02:48.109
We can classify them --

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:51.148
harmless steam plumes,
white and evanescent;

00:02:51.172 --> 00:02:54.688
polluting smokestacks,
dark and persistent --

00:02:54.712 --> 00:02:58.471
and provide policy makers
with a map of neighborhood pollution.

00:02:59.777 --> 00:03:03.666
This cross-disciplinary project
created transformational solutions.

00:03:05.942 --> 00:03:08.855
But the data analysis methodologies
we use in astrophysics

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.840
can be applied to all sorts of data,

00:03:10.864 --> 00:03:12.014
not just images.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.934
We were asked to help
a California district attorney

00:03:14.958 --> 00:03:18.379
understand prosecutorial delays
in their jurisdiction.

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:21.506
There are people on probation
or sitting in jail,

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.141
awaiting for trial sometimes for years.

00:03:24.165 --> 00:03:26.609
They wanted to know
what kind of cases dragged on,

00:03:26.633 --> 00:03:29.757
and they had a massive data set
to explore to understand it,

00:03:29.781 --> 00:03:31.193
but didn't have the expertise

00:03:31.217 --> 00:03:33.765
or the instruments
in their office to do so.

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:35.535
And that's where we came in.

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:38.956
I worked with my colleague,
public policy professor Angela Hawken,

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.466
and our team first created
a visual dashboard

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.390
for DAs to see and better understand
the prosecution process.

00:03:46.997 --> 00:03:49.926
But also, we ourselves
analyzed their data,

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.470
looking to see if the duration
of the process

00:03:52.494 --> 00:03:55.684
suffered from social inequalities
in their jurisdiction.

00:03:56.367 --> 00:03:57.909
We did so using methods

00:03:57.933 --> 00:04:00.906
that I would use to classify
thousands of stellar explosions,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.585
applied to thousands of court cases.

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:04.760
And in doing so,

00:04:04.784 --> 00:04:07.617
we built a model that can be applied
to other jurisdictions

00:04:07.641 --> 00:04:09.831
who are willing to explore their biases.

00:04:09.855 --> 00:04:13.101
These collaborations between
domain experts and astrophysicists

00:04:13.125 --> 00:04:15.180
created transformational solutions

00:04:15.204 --> 00:04:17.604
to help improve people's quality of life.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:20.910
But it is a two-way road.

00:04:20.934 --> 00:04:23.477
I bring my astrophysics background
to urban science,

00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:27.342
and I bring what I learn in urban science
back to astrophysics.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.782
Light echoes:

00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:35.028
the reflections of stellar explosions
onto interstellar dust.

00:04:36.046 --> 00:04:41.831
In our images, these reflections appear
as white, evanescent, moving features,

00:04:41.855 --> 00:04:43.005
just like plumes.

00:04:43.363 --> 00:04:47.258
I am adapting the same models
that detect plumes in city images

00:04:47.282 --> 00:04:50.210
to detect light echoes
in images of the sky.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.583
By exploring the things
that interest and excite me,

00:04:55.607 --> 00:04:57.403
reaching outside of my domain,

00:04:57.427 --> 00:05:00.303
I did turn my restlessness into an asset.

00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:06.078
We, you, all have a unique perspective
that can generate new insight

00:05:06.102 --> 00:05:10.285
and lead to new, unexpected,
transformational solutions.

00:05:10.944 --> 00:05:12.106
Thank you.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.288
(Applause)
