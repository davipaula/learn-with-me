00:00:12.793 --> 00:00:16.963
Pollinator decline is a grand challenge
in the modern world.

00:00:16.987 --> 00:00:19.896
Of the 200,000 species of pollinators,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.756
honeybees are the most well-understood,

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.973
partly because of our long history
with them dating back 8,000 years ago

00:00:26.997 --> 00:00:30.165
to our cave drawings
in what is now modern-day Spain.

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.519
And yet we know that
this indicator species is dying off.

00:00:34.543 --> 00:00:39.818
Last year alone, we lost 40 percent
of all beehives in the United States.

00:00:39.842 --> 00:00:42.541
That number is even higher
in areas with harsh winters,

00:00:42.565 --> 00:00:43.925
like here in Massachusetts,

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.817
where we lost 47 percent of beehives

00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:48.436
in one year alone.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.825
Can you imagine if we lost
half of our people last year?

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:54.938
And if those were
the food-producing people?

00:00:55.544 --> 00:00:56.694
It's untenable.

00:00:57.241 --> 00:01:00.689
And I predict that in 10 years,

00:01:00.713 --> 00:01:03.100
we will lose our bees.

00:01:04.027 --> 00:01:08.340
If not for the work of beekeepers
replacing these dead beehives,

00:01:08.364 --> 00:01:11.279
we would be without foods
that we rely upon:

00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:13.125
fruits, vegetables,

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.410
crunchy almonds and nuts,

00:01:15.434 --> 00:01:16.838
tart apples,

00:01:16.862 --> 00:01:18.838
sour lemons.

00:01:18.862 --> 00:01:24.116
Even the food that our cattle rely
upon to eat, hay and alfalfa -- gone,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.105
causing global hunger,

00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:27.931
economic collapse,

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:30.397
a total moral crisis across earth.

00:01:31.417 --> 00:01:34.151
Now, I first started keeping bees
here in Cape Cod

00:01:34.175 --> 00:01:37.560
right after I finished my doctorate
in honeybee immunology.

00:01:37.584 --> 00:01:40.016
(Laughter)

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.547
(Applause)

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.530
Imagine getting such a degree
in a good economy --

00:01:49.554 --> 00:01:51.315
and it was 2009:

00:01:52.242 --> 00:01:53.762
the Great Recession.

00:01:54.456 --> 00:01:56.017
And I was onto something.

00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:59.714
I knew that I could find out
how to improve bee health.

00:01:59.738 --> 00:02:03.093
And so the community
on Cape Cod here in Provincetown

00:02:03.117 --> 00:02:04.783
was ripe for citizen science,

00:02:04.807 --> 00:02:07.647
people looking for ways
to get involved and to help.

00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:10.008
And so we met with people in coffee shops.

00:02:10.032 --> 00:02:13.595
A wonderful woman named Natalie
got eight beehives at her home in Truro,

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:15.705
and she introduced us
to her friend Valerie,

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:21.307
who let us set up 60 beehives at
an abandoned tennis court on her property.

00:02:21.902 --> 00:02:25.063
And so we started testing
vaccines for bees.

00:02:25.087 --> 00:02:27.606
We were starting to look at probiotics.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.246
We called it "bee yogurt" --

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.316
ways to make bees healthier.

00:02:31.798 --> 00:02:34.708
And our citizen science project
started to take off.

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:38.057
Meanwhile, back in my apartment here,

00:02:38.081 --> 00:02:40.517
I was a bit nervous about my landlord.

00:02:40.968 --> 00:02:43.316
I figured I should tell him
what we were doing.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.369
(Laughter)

00:02:44.393 --> 00:02:47.855
I was terrified; I really thought
I was going to get an eviction notice,

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.189
which really was
the last thing we needed, right?

00:02:50.213 --> 00:02:52.341
I must have caught him
on a good day, though,

00:02:52.365 --> 00:02:54.381
because when I told him what we were doing

00:02:54.405 --> 00:02:57.289
and how we started our nonprofit
urban beekeeping laboratory,

00:02:57.313 --> 00:03:01.212
he said, "That's great!
Let's get a beehive in the back alley."

00:03:01.236 --> 00:03:02.621
I was shocked.

00:03:02.645 --> 00:03:04.443
I was completely surprised.

00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:06.634
I mean, instead of getting
an eviction notice,

00:03:06.658 --> 00:03:08.342
we got another data point.

00:03:08.366 --> 00:03:10.691
And in the back alley of this image,

00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:13.320
what you see here, this hidden beehive --

00:03:13.344 --> 00:03:15.914
that beehive produced
more honey that first year

00:03:15.938 --> 00:03:19.096
than we have ever experienced
in any beehive we had managed.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.744
It shifted our research
perspective forever.

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:26.635
It changed our research question away from
"How do we save the dead and dying bees?"

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.978
to "Where are bees doing best?"

00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:31.941
And we started to be able
to put maps together,

00:03:31.965 --> 00:03:34.287
looking at all of these
citizen science beehives

00:03:34.311 --> 00:03:36.739
from people who had
beehives at home decks,

00:03:36.763 --> 00:03:38.840
gardens, business rooftops.

00:03:38.864 --> 00:03:40.434
We started to engage the public,

00:03:40.458 --> 00:03:43.045
and the more people who got
these little data points,

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.722
the more accurate our maps became.

00:03:44.746 --> 00:03:47.921
And so when you're sitting here thinking,
"How can I get involved?"

00:03:47.945 --> 00:03:50.214
you might think about a story
of my friend Fred,

00:03:50.238 --> 00:03:52.223
who's a commercial real estate developer.

00:03:52.247 --> 00:03:54.323
He was thinking the same thing.

00:03:54.347 --> 00:03:55.736
He was at a meeting,

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.310
thinking about what he could do
for tenant relations

00:03:58.334 --> 00:04:00.143
and sustainability at scale.

00:04:00.167 --> 00:04:01.913
And while he was having a tea break,

00:04:01.937 --> 00:04:05.101
he put honey into his tea
and noticed on the honey jar

00:04:05.125 --> 00:04:08.933
a message about corporate sustainability
from the host company of that meeting.

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:10.927
And it sparked an idea.

00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:12.614
He came back to his office.

00:04:12.638 --> 00:04:15.932
An email, a phone call later,
and -- boom! --

00:04:15.956 --> 00:04:17.913
we went national together.

00:04:18.322 --> 00:04:21.592
We put dozens of beehives
on the rooftops of their skyscrapers

00:04:21.616 --> 00:04:24.605
across nine cities nationwide.

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:25.935
Nine years later --

00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:31.716
(Applause)

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.554
Nine years later, we have raised
over a million dollars for bee research.

00:04:36.578 --> 00:04:41.739
We have a thousand beehives
as little data points across the country,

00:04:41.763 --> 00:04:43.152
18 states and counting,

00:04:43.176 --> 00:04:47.458
where we have created paying jobs
for local beekeepers, 65 of them,

00:04:47.482 --> 00:04:50.212
to manage beehives
in their own communities,

00:04:50.236 --> 00:04:53.053
to connect with people, everyday people,

00:04:53.077 --> 00:04:57.357
who are now data points
together making a difference.

00:04:57.866 --> 00:05:00.487
So in order to explain
what's actually been saving bees,

00:05:00.511 --> 00:05:01.673
where they're thriving,

00:05:01.697 --> 00:05:04.124
I need to first tell you
what's been killing them.

00:05:04.148 --> 00:05:06.028
The top three killers of bees

00:05:06.052 --> 00:05:09.921
are agricultural chemicals such as
pesticides, herbicides, fungicides;

00:05:09.945 --> 00:05:12.318
diseases of bees, of which there are many;

00:05:12.342 --> 00:05:13.878
and habitat loss.

00:05:13.902 --> 00:05:15.973
So what we did is we looked on our maps

00:05:15.997 --> 00:05:18.359
and we identified areas
where bees were thriving.

00:05:18.383 --> 00:05:21.149
This was mostly in cities, we found.

00:05:21.173 --> 00:05:24.128
Data are now showing that urban
beehives produce more honey

00:05:24.152 --> 00:05:26.813
than rural beehives and suburban beehives.

00:05:26.837 --> 00:05:31.758
Urban beehives have a longer life span
than rural and suburban beehives,

00:05:31.782 --> 00:05:34.195
and bees in the city are more biodiverse;

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:36.962
there are more bee species in urban areas.

00:05:36.986 --> 00:05:38.437
(Laughter)

00:05:38.461 --> 00:05:39.700
Right?

00:05:39.724 --> 00:05:41.048
Why is this?

00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:43.011
That was our question.

00:05:43.035 --> 00:05:45.243
So we started with
these three killers of bees,

00:05:45.267 --> 00:05:46.422
and we flipped it:

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:48.581
Which of these is different in the cities?

00:05:48.605 --> 00:05:50.151
So the first one, pesticides.

00:05:50.175 --> 00:05:52.853
We partnered up with
the Harvard School of Public Health.

00:05:52.877 --> 00:05:54.370
We shared our data with them.

00:05:54.394 --> 00:05:56.976
We collected samples
from our citizen science beehives

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.946
at people's homes and business rooftops.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.417
We looked at pesticide levels.

00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:04.243
We thought there would be less pesticides
in areas where bees are doing better.

00:06:04.267 --> 00:06:05.430
That's not the case.

00:06:05.454 --> 00:06:09.504
So what we found here in our study
is -- the orange bars are Boston,

00:06:09.528 --> 00:06:11.783
and we thought those bars
would be the lowest,

00:06:11.807 --> 00:06:14.041
there would be the lowest
levels of pesticides.

00:06:14.065 --> 00:06:18.074
And, in fact, there are
the most pesticides in cities.

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:21.361
So the pesticide hypothesis
for what's saving bees --

00:06:21.385 --> 00:06:22.784
less pesticides in cities --

00:06:22.808 --> 00:06:24.213
is not it.

00:06:24.237 --> 00:06:28.107
And this is very typical
of my life as a scientist.

00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:30.021
Anytime I've had a hypothesis,

00:06:30.045 --> 00:06:33.365
not only is it not supported,
but the opposite is true.

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:34.410
(Laughter)

00:06:34.434 --> 00:06:36.569
Which is still an interesting
finding, right?

00:06:36.593 --> 00:06:37.753
We moved on.

00:06:37.777 --> 00:06:38.951
The disease hypothesis.

00:06:38.975 --> 00:06:41.270
We looked at diseases
all over our beehives.

00:06:41.294 --> 00:06:45.407
And what we found in a similar study
to this one with North Carolina State is:

00:06:45.431 --> 00:06:47.557
there's no difference
between disease in bees

00:06:47.581 --> 00:06:49.332
in urban, suburban and rural areas.

00:06:49.356 --> 00:06:51.958
Diseases are everywhere;
bees are sick and dying.

00:06:51.982 --> 00:06:54.448
In fact, there were more diseases
of bees in cities.

00:06:54.472 --> 00:06:56.504
This was from Raleigh, North Carolina.

00:06:56.528 --> 00:07:00.515
So again, my hypothesis was not supported.
The opposite was true.

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:01.988
We're moving on.

00:07:02.012 --> 00:07:04.270
(Laughter)

00:07:04.294 --> 00:07:06.388
The habitat hypothesis.

00:07:06.412 --> 00:07:10.063
This said that areas where bees
are thriving have a better habitat --

00:07:10.087 --> 00:07:11.702
more flowers, right?

00:07:11.726 --> 00:07:13.524
But we didn't know how to test this.

00:07:13.548 --> 00:07:15.608
So I had a really interesting meeting.

00:07:15.632 --> 00:07:18.749
An idea sparked with my friend
and colleague Anne Madden,

00:07:18.773 --> 00:07:19.956
fellow TED speaker.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.632
We thought about genomics,
kind of like AncestryDNA or 23andMe.

00:07:24.656 --> 00:07:25.991
Have you done these?

00:07:26.015 --> 00:07:28.651
You spit in a tube and
you find out, "I'm German!"

00:07:28.675 --> 00:07:29.778
(Laughter)

00:07:29.802 --> 00:07:31.651
Well, we developed this for honey.

00:07:31.675 --> 00:07:35.221
So we have a sample of honey
and we look at all the plant DNA,

00:07:35.245 --> 00:07:37.090
and we find out, "I'm sumac!"

00:07:37.114 --> 00:07:38.384
(Laughter)

00:07:38.408 --> 00:07:40.792
And that's what we found
here in Provincetown.

00:07:40.816 --> 00:07:43.355
So for the first time ever,
I'm able to report to you

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:46.169
what type of honey is from right here
in our own community.

00:07:46.193 --> 00:07:48.626
HoneyDNA, a genomics test.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.286
Spring honey in Provincetown
is from privet.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.681
What's privet? Hedges.

00:07:53.705 --> 00:07:54.860
What's the message?

00:07:54.884 --> 00:07:57.456
Don't trim your hedges to save the bees.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.590
(Laughter)

00:07:58.614 --> 00:08:01.062
I know we're getting crunchy
and it's controversial,

00:08:01.086 --> 00:08:02.712
so before you throw your tomatoes,

00:08:02.736 --> 00:08:05.472
we'll move to the summer honey,
which is water lily honey.

00:08:05.496 --> 00:08:08.376
If you have honey from Provincetown
right here in the summer,

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.169
you're eating water lily juice;

00:08:10.193 --> 00:08:12.608
in the fall, sumac honey.

00:08:12.632 --> 00:08:15.781
We're learning about our food
for the first time ever.

00:08:15.805 --> 00:08:19.285
And now we're able to report,
if you need to do any city planning:

00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:21.012
What are good things to plant?

00:08:21.036 --> 00:08:24.919
What do we know the bees are going to
that's good for your garden?

00:08:24.943 --> 00:08:28.267
For the first time ever for any community,
we now know this answer.

00:08:28.291 --> 00:08:31.673
What's more interesting for us
is deeper in the data.

00:08:31.697 --> 00:08:35.063
So, if you're from the Caribbean
and you want to explore your heritage,

00:08:35.087 --> 00:08:37.801
Bahamian honey is from the laurel family,

00:08:37.825 --> 00:08:40.460
cinnamon and avocado flavors.

00:08:40.484 --> 00:08:43.432
But what's more interesting is
85 different plant species

00:08:43.456 --> 00:08:45.122
in one teaspoon of honey.

00:08:45.146 --> 00:08:47.657
That's the measure we want, the big data.

00:08:47.681 --> 00:08:50.656
Indian honey: that is oak.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.134
Every sample we've tested
from India is oak,

00:08:53.158 --> 00:08:57.611
and that's 172 different flavors
in one taste of Indian honey.

00:08:57.635 --> 00:09:01.185
Provincetown honey goes from
116 plants in the spring

00:09:01.209 --> 00:09:04.150
to over 200 plants in the summer.

00:09:04.174 --> 00:09:07.622
These are the numbers that we need
to test the habitat hypothesis.

00:09:07.646 --> 00:09:09.395
In another citizen science approach,

00:09:09.419 --> 00:09:12.687
you find out about your food
and we get some interesting data.

00:09:12.711 --> 00:09:14.945
We're finding out now that in rural areas,

00:09:14.969 --> 00:09:18.480
there are 150 plants on average
in a sample of honey.

00:09:18.504 --> 00:09:20.024
That's a measure for rural.

00:09:20.048 --> 00:09:22.114
Suburban areas, what might you think?

00:09:22.138 --> 00:09:26.268
Do they have less or more plants
in suburban areas with lawns

00:09:26.292 --> 00:09:30.302
that look nice for people
but they're terrible for pollinators?

00:09:30.326 --> 00:09:32.916
Suburbs have very low plant diversity,

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.819
so if you have a beautiful lawn,

00:09:34.843 --> 00:09:37.822
good for you, but you can do more.

00:09:37.846 --> 00:09:40.958
You can have a patch of your lawn
that's a wildflower meadow

00:09:40.982 --> 00:09:42.414
to diversify your habitat,

00:09:42.438 --> 00:09:44.659
to improve pollinator health.

00:09:44.683 --> 00:09:46.597
Anybody can do this.

00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:50.714
Urban areas have
the most habitat, best habitat,

00:09:50.738 --> 00:09:53.296
as you can see here:
over 200 different plants.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.900
We have, for the first time ever,
support for the habitat hypothesis.

00:09:57.407 --> 00:10:00.630
We also now know
how we can work with cities.

00:10:00.654 --> 00:10:03.059
The City of Boston has
eight times better habitat

00:10:03.083 --> 00:10:04.393
than its nearby suburbs.

00:10:04.417 --> 00:10:08.171
And so when we work
with governments, we can scale this.

00:10:08.195 --> 00:10:10.204
You might think
on my tombstone, it'll say,

00:10:10.228 --> 00:10:12.565
"Here lies Noah. Plant a flower." Right?

00:10:12.589 --> 00:10:15.715
I mean -- it's exhausting
after all of this.

00:10:16.255 --> 00:10:17.888
But when we scale together,

00:10:17.912 --> 00:10:20.107
when we go to governments
and city planners --

00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:22.457
like in Boston, the honey
is mostly linden trees,

00:10:22.481 --> 00:10:25.907
and we say, "If a dead tree
needs to be replaced, consider linden."

00:10:25.931 --> 00:10:29.352
When we take this information
to governments, we can do amazing things.

00:10:29.376 --> 00:10:31.225
This is a rooftop from Fred's company.

00:10:31.249 --> 00:10:34.963
We can plant those things
on top of rooftops worldwide

00:10:34.987 --> 00:10:38.048
to start restoring habitat
and securing food systems.

00:10:38.072 --> 00:10:39.604
We've worked with the World Bank

00:10:39.628 --> 00:10:42.370
and the presidential delegation
from the country of Haiti.

00:10:42.394 --> 00:10:46.148
We've worked with wonderful graduate
students at Yale University and Ethiopia.

00:10:46.172 --> 00:10:48.585
In these countries,
we can add value to their honey

00:10:48.609 --> 00:10:49.881
by identifying what it is,

00:10:49.905 --> 00:10:51.893
but informing the people of what to plant

00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:55.099
to restore their habitat
and secure their food systems.

00:10:55.123 --> 00:10:58.991
But what I think is even more important
is when we think about natural disasters.

00:10:59.015 --> 00:11:00.166
For the first time,

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.242
we now know how we can have
a baseline measure of any habitat

00:11:03.266 --> 00:11:05.258
before it might be destroyed.

00:11:05.282 --> 00:11:06.959
Think about your hometown.

00:11:06.983 --> 00:11:10.410
What risks does
the environment pose to it?

00:11:10.434 --> 00:11:13.953
This is how we're going to save
Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.

00:11:14.541 --> 00:11:17.390
We now have a baseline measure of honey,

00:11:17.414 --> 00:11:20.169
honey DNA from before and after the storm.

00:11:20.193 --> 00:11:22.203
We started in Humacao.

00:11:22.227 --> 00:11:24.750
This is right where
Hurricane Maria made landfall.

00:11:24.774 --> 00:11:28.583
And we know what plants to replace
and in what quantity and where

00:11:28.607 --> 00:11:31.422
by triangulating honey DNA samples.

00:11:32.112 --> 00:11:34.112
You might even think about right here,

00:11:34.136 --> 00:11:36.803
the beautiful land
that connected us, that primed us,

00:11:36.827 --> 00:11:38.694
all the citizen science to begin with,

00:11:38.718 --> 00:11:40.867
the erosion, the winter storms

00:11:40.891 --> 00:11:43.145
that are getting more violent every year.

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:45.044
What are we going to do about this,

00:11:45.068 --> 00:11:46.847
our precious land?

00:11:46.871 --> 00:11:48.210
Well, looking at honey DNA,

00:11:48.234 --> 00:11:51.534
we can see what plants are good
for pollinators that have deep roots,

00:11:51.558 --> 00:11:53.369
that can secure the land,

00:11:53.393 --> 00:11:55.602
and together, everybody can participate.

00:11:55.626 --> 00:11:57.992
And the solution fits in a teaspoon.

00:11:58.506 --> 00:12:03.300
If your hometown might get swept away
or destroyed by a natural disaster,

00:12:03.324 --> 00:12:06.621
we now have a blueprint suspended in time

00:12:06.645 --> 00:12:09.173
for how to restore that on Earth,

00:12:09.197 --> 00:12:13.390
or perhaps even in a greenhouse on Mars.

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:17.520
I know it sounds crazy,
but think about this:

00:12:17.544 --> 00:12:19.377
a new Provincetown,

00:12:19.401 --> 00:12:21.043
a new hometown,

00:12:21.067 --> 00:12:24.545
a place that might be familiar
that's also good for pollinators

00:12:24.569 --> 00:12:25.933
for a stable food system,

00:12:25.957 --> 00:12:28.008
when we're thinking about the future.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.522
Now, together, we know
what's saving bees --

00:12:32.546 --> 00:12:34.284
by planting diverse habitat.

00:12:34.741 --> 00:12:38.856
Now, together, we know how bees
are going to save us --

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.061
by being barometers
for environmental health,

00:12:42.085 --> 00:12:44.760
by being blueprints,
sources of information,

00:12:44.784 --> 00:12:47.613
little data factories suspended in time.

00:12:48.148 --> 00:12:49.313
Thank you.

00:12:49.337 --> 00:12:53.050
(Applause)
