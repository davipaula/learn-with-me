00:00:13.451 --> 00:00:14.601
Human origins.

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:16.375
Who are we?

00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:18.325
Where do we come from,

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:19.560
and how do we know?

00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:22.936
In my field, paleoanthropology,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.732
we explore human origins --

00:00:24.756 --> 00:00:26.819
the "who" and "where" questions --

00:00:26.843 --> 00:00:30.602
by analyzing fossils that date back
thousands and even millions of years.

00:00:32.085 --> 00:00:37.681
In 2015, a team of colleagues and I
named a new species in the genus Homo --

00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:39.305
our genus --

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.479
Homo naledi.

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:45.133
Let's take a step back
and put that into context.

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.980
The last common ancestors
between humans and chimps

00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:52.635
date somewhere between six
and eight million years.

00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:55.996
The earliest hominins,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.961
or earliest human ancestors,

00:00:57.985 --> 00:01:00.700
evolved into a group
known as the australopithecines.

00:01:01.844 --> 00:01:05.187
The australopithecines
evolved into the genus Homo

00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:08.010
and eventually modern humans -- us.

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:11.496
With each new fossil discovery,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.509
we get a little bit closer
to better understanding who we are

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:16.832
and where we came from.

00:01:17.653 --> 00:01:19.665
With these new fossil finds,

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.344
we realize we now have to make
changes to this tree.

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:26.505
Until this discovery,

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:30.295
we thought we had a pretty good idea
about the patterns of evolutionary change.

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:33.153
Current fossil evidence suggests

00:01:33.177 --> 00:01:36.928
that the earliest populations
of the genus Homo evolved in Africa

00:01:36.952 --> 00:01:39.182
somewhere between two
and three million years.

00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:43.750
Fast-forward to approximately
300,000 years to where we see the origins

00:01:43.774 --> 00:01:45.360
of the first modern humans.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:49.061
While the fossil record
between these time frames in Africa

00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:51.253
is relatively sparse,

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:54.780
the fossils nonetheless
demonstrated certain trends

00:01:54.804 --> 00:01:57.780
from our earliest ancestors
to modern humans.

00:01:58.822 --> 00:02:01.267
For example, our brains
were becoming larger

00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:02.821
relative the rest of our body.

00:02:03.417 --> 00:02:06.137
Our pelves were becoming more bowl-shaped,

00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:09.197
and our hand-wrist morphology, or form,

00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:13.576
suggested a change in our grip
as we began to make and use stone tools

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.375
and spend less time in the trees.

00:02:16.777 --> 00:02:22.400
These new fossils disrupt everything
we thought we knew about these trends

00:02:22.424 --> 00:02:25.988
and force us to change the way
that we think about human evolution.

00:02:28.745 --> 00:02:30.236
South Africa in general,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.303
but the Cradle of Humankind in particular,

00:02:32.327 --> 00:02:36.071
contains numerous sites where hundreds
of thousands of fossils have been found.

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:40.235
As an undergraduate student,
I fell in love with one of them ...

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:41.412
Mrs. Ples.

00:02:41.436 --> 00:02:44.769
The skull of a 2.1-million-year-old
early human ancestor.

00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:46.719
From that point on,

00:02:46.743 --> 00:02:49.854
I was determined to go to South Africa
and study human evolution.

00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:52.799
I first traveled there in 2003,

00:02:52.823 --> 00:02:55.347
and I did get to see my beloved Mrs. Ples.

00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:56.511
(Laughter)

00:02:56.535 --> 00:02:59.536
But words can hardly convey my excitement

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.958
when I was chosen
as an early career scientist

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:04.269
by Lee Berger,

00:03:04.293 --> 00:03:06.720
a world-renowned paleoanthropologist,

00:03:06.744 --> 00:03:12.545
to be one of the primary analysts
of recently excavated unpublished fossils.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.170
This treasure trove of fossils
was being recovered from a new site

00:03:18.194 --> 00:03:21.536
called the Dinaledi Chamber
in the Rising Star cave system.

00:03:23.094 --> 00:03:27.109
Species are often named
based on a skull, a lower jaw,

00:03:27.133 --> 00:03:28.490
or, very rarely,

00:03:28.514 --> 00:03:32.119
a handful of postcranial,
or below-the-neck, elements.

00:03:32.838 --> 00:03:35.766
The fossils from Dinaledi
were another story altogether.

00:03:36.462 --> 00:03:40.056
An unprecedented
approximately 1800 specimens --

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.490
so far --

00:03:41.514 --> 00:03:44.227
have been excavated
from the Rising Star system,

00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:47.044
representing at least
15 individual skeletons.

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:52.339
The research team
that I was invited to join

00:03:52.363 --> 00:03:56.131
was tasked with describing,
comparing and analyzing the fossils,

00:03:56.155 --> 00:04:00.614
with the difficult goal of identifying
to what species the fossils belonged.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.434
We were divided up
into our different areas of expertise.

00:04:04.925 --> 00:04:07.468
We were divided up
in different areas of the lab, too.

00:04:07.492 --> 00:04:10.990
So there was "Hand Land,"
for the fossil hand people,

00:04:11.014 --> 00:04:12.704
"Hip Heaven" for the pelvis ...

00:04:13.457 --> 00:04:15.130
I was in the "Tooth Booth."

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:16.682
(Laughter)

00:04:16.706 --> 00:04:19.406
And after long, intense days in the lab,

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.665
the different teams would meet up at night
and discuss our findings,

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:25.765
still consumed by questions
from our analyses.

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.518
It was incredible how different
the interpretations were.

00:04:29.137 --> 00:04:32.323
Each body part seemed to come
from a different species,

00:04:32.347 --> 00:04:34.515
based on what we knew
from the fossil record.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.990
The suite of characteristics we were
seeing didn't match any known species.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.115
And if we had only recovered the skull,
we might have called it one thing;

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.542
if we had only recovered the pelvis,
we might have called it another.

00:04:48.388 --> 00:04:51.269
The anatomy of the skeletons
didn't make sense

00:04:51.293 --> 00:04:54.697
with the framework of what we thought
we knew of human evolution.

00:04:55.898 --> 00:04:57.497
Did it belong in the genus Homo?

00:04:58.108 --> 00:05:00.017
Should it be an australopithecine?

00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:02.516
Those bipedal, more apelike ancestors?

00:05:03.036 --> 00:05:05.099
Or perhaps it should be its own species.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.058
Ultimately, after much deliberation,

00:05:09.082 --> 00:05:13.200
we decided the Rising Star specimens
did indeed warrant a new species,

00:05:13.224 --> 00:05:15.137
which we called "Homo naledi."

00:05:16.934 --> 00:05:18.490
From the head to the feet,

00:05:18.514 --> 00:05:22.115
the fossils present a mosaic
of primitive, or ancestral,

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:24.494
and derived or more modern-like features.

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.142
The skull is quite derived,

00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:31.806
appearing most similar to early
representatives of the genus Homo,

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.178
like Homo habilis and Homo erectus.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:39.175
However, the brain is scarcely
half the size of a modern human one.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.610
One that is smaller than any other
early Homo that has ever been found.

00:05:45.437 --> 00:05:47.268
As someone who studies teeth,

00:05:47.292 --> 00:05:50.197
I might argue these are the coolest
fossils found at the site.

00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:51.271
(Laughter)

00:05:51.295 --> 00:05:54.559
The assemblage consists of 190
whole or fragmentary teeth

00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:57.066
that range in age
from very old to very young.

00:05:58.501 --> 00:05:59.753
Like the skeletons,

00:05:59.777 --> 00:06:02.540
the teeth present a mix
of primitive and derived traits.

00:06:03.444 --> 00:06:04.937
In modern humans,

00:06:04.961 --> 00:06:09.600
the third molar is typically the smallest,
while the first molar is the biggest,

00:06:09.624 --> 00:06:11.765
but Homo naledi
has the primitive condition

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:15.317
where the third molar is the biggest
and the first molar is the smallest.

00:06:16.111 --> 00:06:17.262
The anterior teeth,

00:06:17.286 --> 00:06:19.387
or the incisors and canines,

00:06:19.411 --> 00:06:22.284
are small for the genus Homo,

00:06:22.308 --> 00:06:25.447
and the lower canine
has a cuspulid on it --

00:06:25.471 --> 00:06:29.527
an extra cuspule that gives it
a distinct mitten-like shape

00:06:29.551 --> 00:06:34.432
that it shares with some specimens
of the early human, Homo erectus.

00:06:35.744 --> 00:06:38.970
The overall shape of the teeth
looked odd to me,

00:06:38.994 --> 00:06:41.520
so I performed crown-shape analysis

00:06:41.544 --> 00:06:46.091
on the occlusal surfaces
of deciduous teeth, or baby teeth --

00:06:46.115 --> 00:06:47.530
on your left --

00:06:47.554 --> 00:06:50.316
and the permanent premolars
and molars on your right.

00:06:51.672 --> 00:06:54.982
The deciduous teeth are especially narrow,

00:06:55.006 --> 00:06:58.418
and the premolars are unique
in their outline shape

00:06:58.442 --> 00:06:59.944
compared to other hominids.

00:07:00.577 --> 00:07:03.031
In fact, when I compare the outlines,

00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:04.943
when I lay them on top of each other,

00:07:04.967 --> 00:07:06.589
they look very similar.

00:07:07.203 --> 00:07:10.088
We say they have
"low intraspecific variations,"

00:07:10.112 --> 00:07:12.371
so the variation
within the species is low.

00:07:12.395 --> 00:07:15.322
When I compare this to groups
like the australopithecines,

00:07:15.346 --> 00:07:18.108
the intraspecific variation
is much larger.

00:07:20.172 --> 00:07:22.407
Postcranially, the team concluded

00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:25.821
that the position of the shoulders
suggesting naledi was a climber;

00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:30.785
the flared pelvis and curved fingers
are all primitive for the genus Homo.

00:07:31.554 --> 00:07:33.015
On the other hand,

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:37.450
the humanlike wrist,
long slender legs and modern feet

00:07:37.474 --> 00:07:40.042
are all consistent
with other members of the genus.

00:07:42.992 --> 00:07:47.713
In 2017, we announced
more specimens of Homo naledi

00:07:47.737 --> 00:07:49.733
from the nearby Lesedi Chamber,

00:07:49.757 --> 00:07:51.750
also in the Rising Star cave system.

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:56.306
In addition, our geology team
managed to produce an age estimate.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.144
The date's a big deal
because, up until now,

00:08:00.168 --> 00:08:04.928
we had based our analysis solely
on the morphology of the specimens,

00:08:04.952 --> 00:08:07.552
without previous knowledge
of how old something is --

00:08:07.576 --> 00:08:10.933
something which could unconsciously
bias our interpretations.

00:08:11.623 --> 00:08:14.648
With its small brain and flared pelvis,

00:08:14.672 --> 00:08:16.197
we would not have been surprised

00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:18.758
if the fossils turned out to be
two million years old.

00:08:19.171 --> 00:08:21.448
Instead, the fossils dated

00:08:21.472 --> 00:08:26.278
to 235 to 336 thousand years,

00:08:26.302 --> 00:08:29.180
an incredibly young date
for such a small-brained individual.

00:08:29.889 --> 00:08:31.652
So think back to what I said earlier:

00:08:31.676 --> 00:08:35.540
we thought that our brains were becoming
larger relative to the rest of our body.

00:08:35.564 --> 00:08:40.051
Now we have a small-brained,
young individual complicating this idea.

00:08:41.122 --> 00:08:42.785
What does all this mean?

00:08:44.097 --> 00:08:45.467
Homo naledi has taught us

00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:48.806
that we need to reassess
what it means to be in the genus Homo.

00:08:49.217 --> 00:08:51.394
We need to rethink
what it means to be human.

00:08:51.986 --> 00:08:56.230
In fact, most of the characteristics
that we use to define the genus Homo,

00:08:56.254 --> 00:08:58.903
such as brain size and hip morphology,

00:08:58.927 --> 00:09:00.343
are no longer valid.

00:09:01.235 --> 00:09:05.818
No other species exists with this mix
of primitive and derived traits.

00:09:07.127 --> 00:09:10.249
Why is there so much morphological
variation in the genus Homo?

00:09:10.273 --> 00:09:12.516
And what force is driving that variation?

00:09:14.172 --> 00:09:17.795
Another implication for these fossils
is that for the first time,

00:09:17.819 --> 00:09:21.767
we have concrete evidence
of a species coexisting in Africa,

00:09:21.791 --> 00:09:23.030
at 300,000 years,

00:09:23.054 --> 00:09:24.361
with modern humans.

00:09:25.029 --> 00:09:26.351
Until this discovery,

00:09:26.375 --> 00:09:31.329
we only had large-brained
modern humans that existed in Africa.

00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:34.837
Did they interbreed with each other?

00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:36.806
Did they compete with each other?

00:09:38.906 --> 00:09:42.315
Another implication
that these fossils have

00:09:42.339 --> 00:09:45.357
is for the archaeologists
studying stone tools in South Africa.

00:09:45.924 --> 00:09:49.180
Keep in mind that neither the Dinaledi
nor the Lesedi Chambers

00:09:49.204 --> 00:09:51.073
have any artifacts in them.

00:09:51.489 --> 00:09:55.995
However, they do overlap in time
with several stone-tool industries,

00:09:56.019 --> 00:09:59.912
the makers of which are considered
to be either modern humans

00:09:59.936 --> 00:10:01.673
or direct human ancestors.

00:10:02.645 --> 00:10:04.237
This begs the question:

00:10:04.261 --> 00:10:06.370
Who made the stone tools of South Africa?

00:10:07.369 --> 00:10:09.548
Brain size has historically
played a key role

00:10:09.572 --> 00:10:12.101
in identifying a species as a tool user.

00:10:12.125 --> 00:10:14.316
The idea is that you need
to have a large brain

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.029
to have even the capacity
to make stone tools.

00:10:17.053 --> 00:10:18.832
But that notion has been questioned.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.763
Furthermore, Homo naledi,
even with its small brain size,

00:10:22.787 --> 00:10:25.940
has a hand-wrist morphology
similar to other species

00:10:25.964 --> 00:10:28.588
that did make and use stone tools,

00:10:28.612 --> 00:10:30.454
suggesting it had the capability.

00:10:31.314 --> 00:10:35.921
With two species coexisting
in Africa at 300,000 years,

00:10:35.945 --> 00:10:38.520
we can no longer assume
we know the maker of tools

00:10:38.544 --> 00:10:41.922
at sites with no associated species.

00:10:43.771 --> 00:10:46.796
So where does Homo naledi fit
in our human evolutionary lineage?

00:10:47.217 --> 00:10:49.328
Who is it most closely related to?

00:10:49.352 --> 00:10:50.753
Who did it evolve from?

00:10:51.255 --> 00:10:53.269
We're still trying to figure all that out.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:56.313
It's ironic, because
paleoanthropologists are renowned

00:10:56.337 --> 00:10:58.337
for having small sample sizes.

00:10:58.361 --> 00:11:00.314
We now have a large sample size,

00:11:00.338 --> 00:11:02.066
and more questions than answers.

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:04.596
Homo naledi has taught us,

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.306
has brought us a little bit closer

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.361
to better understanding
our evolutionary past.

00:11:10.466 --> 00:11:14.305
So while Mrs. Ples will always hold
a special place in my heart,

00:11:14.329 --> 00:11:16.945
she now shares that space
with several thousand others.

00:11:16.969 --> 00:11:17.999
(Laughter)

00:11:18.023 --> 00:11:19.175
Thank you.

00:11:19.199 --> 00:11:21.855
(Applause)
