00:00:07.867 --> 00:00:11.598
Imagine, for a second,
a duck teaching a French class,

00:00:11.598 --> 00:00:15.167
a ping-pong match in orbit 
around a black hole,

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:17.788
a dolphin balancing a pineapple.

00:00:17.788 --> 00:00:21.277
You probably haven't actually seen
any of these things,

00:00:21.277 --> 00:00:23.937
but you could imagine them instantly.

00:00:23.937 --> 00:00:27.618
How does your brain produce an image
of something you've never seen?

00:00:27.618 --> 00:00:28.978
That may not seem hard,

00:00:28.978 --> 00:00:31.948
but that's only because 
we're so used to doing it.

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:34.629
It turns out that this is actually
a complex problem

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.818
that requires sophisticated coordination
inside your brain.

00:00:38.818 --> 00:00:41.758
That's because to create 
these new, weird images,

00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:46.667
your brain takes familiar pieces 
and assembles them in new ways,

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:49.789
like a collage made 
from fragments of photos.

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.329
The brain has to juggle a sea of thousands
of electrical signals

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.059
getting them all to their destination
at precisely the right time.

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.779
When you look at an object,

00:00:59.779 --> 00:01:03.658
thousands of neurons 
in your posterior cortex fire.

00:01:03.658 --> 00:01:07.018
These neurons encode various 
characteristics of the object:

00:01:07.018 --> 00:01:11.159
spiky, fruit, brown, green, and yellow.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.540
This synchronous firing strengthens the
connections between that set of neurons,

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.095
linking them together into what's known
as a neuronal ensemble,

00:01:20.095 --> 00:01:22.300
in this case the one for pineapple.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.329
In neuroscience, this is called
the Hebbian principle,

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.839
neurons that fire together wire together.

00:01:28.839 --> 00:01:30.949
If you try to imagine a pineapple later,

00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:35.850
the whole ensemble will light up,
assembling a complete mental image.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.029
Dolphins are encoded by a different
neuronal ensemble.

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:41.050
In fact, every object that you've seen

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.290
is encoded by a neuronal ensemble 
associated with it,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.240
the neurons wired together
by that synchronized firing.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.510
But this principle doesn't explain
the infinite number of objects

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.240
that we can conjure up in our imaginations
without ever seeing them.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.480
The neuronal ensemble for a dolphin
balancing a pineapple doesn't exist.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.922
So how come you can imagine it anyway?

00:02:04.922 --> 00:02:07.760
One hypothesis, 
called the Mental Synthesis Theory,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.130
says that, again, timing is key.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.941
If the neuronal ensembles 
for the dolphin and pineapple

00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:16.172
are activated at the same time,

00:02:16.172 --> 00:02:20.761
we can perceive the two separate objects
as a single image.

00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:24.041
But something in your brain 
has to coordinate that firing.

00:02:24.041 --> 00:02:27.521
One plausible candidate 
is the prefrontal cortex,

00:02:27.521 --> 00:02:31.301
which is involved in 
all complex cognitive functions.

00:02:31.301 --> 00:02:35.172
Prefrontal cortex neurons are connected
to the posterior cortex

00:02:35.172 --> 00:02:40.040
by long, spindly cell extensions
called neural fibers.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.339
The mental synthesis theory proposes
that like a puppeteer pulling the strings,

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:47.869
the prefrontal cortex neurons send
electrical signals

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.582
down these neural fibers

00:02:49.582 --> 00:02:53.410
to multiple ensembles
in the posterior cortex.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.292
This activates them in unison.

00:02:56.292 --> 00:02:59.409
If the neuronal ensembles are turned on
at the same time,

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:04.342
you experience the composite image
just as if you'd actually seen it.

00:03:04.342 --> 00:03:06.551
This conscious purposeful synchronization

00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:09.852
of different neuronal ensembles
by the prefrontal cortex

00:03:09.852 --> 00:03:12.052
is called mental synthesis.

00:03:12.052 --> 00:03:13.813
In order for mental sythesis to work,

00:03:13.813 --> 00:03:19.303
signals would have to arrive at both
neuronal ensembles at the same time.

00:03:19.303 --> 00:03:21.073
The problem is that some neurons

00:03:21.073 --> 00:03:25.083
are much farther away 
from the prefrontal cortex than others.

00:03:25.083 --> 00:03:28.453
If the signals travel down both fibers
at the same rate,

00:03:28.453 --> 00:03:31.163
they'd arrive out of sync.

00:03:31.163 --> 00:03:33.583
You can't change the length 
of the connections,

00:03:33.583 --> 00:03:37.044
but your brain, 
especially as it develops in childhood,

00:03:37.044 --> 00:03:40.884
does have a way to change 
the conduction velocity.

00:03:40.884 --> 00:03:45.534
Neural fibers are wrapped in a fatty
substance called myelin.

00:03:45.534 --> 00:03:47.343
Myelin is an insulator

00:03:47.343 --> 00:03:51.554
and speeds up the electrical signals 
zipping down the nerve fiber.

00:03:51.554 --> 00:03:55.850
Some neural fibers have 
as many as 100 layers of myelin.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.754
Others only have a few.

00:03:57.754 --> 00:04:00.055
And fibers with thicker layers of myelin

00:04:00.055 --> 00:04:04.154
can conduct signals 
100 times faster or more

00:04:04.154 --> 00:04:06.565
than those with thinner ones.

00:04:06.565 --> 00:04:09.995
Some scientists now think that this
difference in myelination

00:04:09.995 --> 00:04:13.835
could be the key 
to uniform conduction time in the brain,

00:04:13.835 --> 00:04:16.925
and consequently, 
to our mental synthesis ability.

00:04:16.925 --> 00:04:20.255
A lot of this myelination 
happens in childhood,

00:04:20.255 --> 00:04:21.814
so from an early age,

00:04:21.814 --> 00:04:26.115
our vibrant imaginations may have a lot
to do with building up brains

00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:28.381
whose carefully myelinated connections

00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:31.824
can craft creative symphonies
throughout our lives.
