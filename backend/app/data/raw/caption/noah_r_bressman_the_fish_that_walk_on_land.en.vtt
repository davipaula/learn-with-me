00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.940
This pond is the only home 
this fish has ever known.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.357
But lately, it’s gotten crowded 
and food is scarce.

00:00:15.357 --> 00:00:18.457
Luckily, it has an option many don’t:

00:00:18.457 --> 00:00:22.475
as a walking catfish, it can dance 
its way out of the water

00:00:22.475 --> 00:00:25.400
and onto bigger and better things.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.975
However, it faces many challenges 
on its terrestrial journey:

00:00:29.975 --> 00:00:32.916
it’s now in danger of suffocating, 
drying up,

00:00:32.916 --> 00:00:35.636
suffering physical damage 
from rough terrain,

00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:37.905
and being hunted by land predators.

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:43.365
We think of fish 
as completely aquatic animals.

00:00:43.365 --> 00:00:48.257
But the walking catfish is just one 
of hundreds of fish species

00:00:48.257 --> 00:00:50.867
that are actually amphibious,

00:00:50.867 --> 00:00:56.371
meaning that they possess adaptations 
that enable them to survive on land.

00:00:56.371 --> 00:01:00.221
Fish amphibiousness is a spectrum.

00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:03.552
At one end are species 
like the mosquitofish

00:01:03.552 --> 00:01:06.410
that’ll only move on land when forced.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.810
And at the other end 
are species like mudskippers

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.470
that nonchalantly hop around mudflats 
for days at a time.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.670
But why do fish make the exodus 
from water to land?

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.112
And how do they cope 
with this drastic transition?

00:01:23.676 --> 00:01:27.786
If temperatures get too high 
for the mangrove rivulus

00:01:27.786 --> 00:01:31.182
in the shallow tropical pools 
it inhabits,

00:01:31.182 --> 00:01:35.988
it’ll flip itself onto a bank 
and cool off in the shade.

00:01:35.988 --> 00:01:37.458
During the dry period,

00:01:37.458 --> 00:01:40.669
it can survive for two months 
out of the water

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:43.609
by staying in moist environments.

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:48.109
Meanwhile, the eel catfish 
makes its onshore voyage

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:51.889
to satisfy its hearty craving for beetles.

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:56.559
And for others, the terrestrial draw 
is more ritualistic.

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:59.089
Every year under the cover of night,

00:01:59.089 --> 00:02:04.879
masses of California grunion flop 
their way onto sandy beaches,

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:09.160
where females deposit thousands of eggs 
into the sand

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.140
before re-entering the ocean.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.223
Underwater, fish breathe with gills,

00:02:15.223 --> 00:02:18.529
which are feathery organs 
packed with blood vessels

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:22.223
that absorb dissolved oxygen 
from the water.

00:02:22.223 --> 00:02:27.144
But in the open air, their gills collapse 
and are rendered useless,

00:02:27.144 --> 00:02:30.724
so amphibious fishes need 
other ways to breathe.

00:02:30.724 --> 00:02:34.873
The armored catfish’s stomach 
is packed with blood vessels,

00:02:34.873 --> 00:02:39.813
so it can gulp down air 
and breathe through its stomach lining.

00:02:39.813 --> 00:02:44.742
And lungfish, being related 
to the ancestors of all tetrapods,

00:02:44.742 --> 00:02:49.353
or four-limbed vertebrates, 
are equipped with true lungs.

00:02:49.353 --> 00:02:53.392
They’ll actually drown 
if they’re kept underwater too long.

00:02:55.312 --> 00:03:00.601
Fish have thin, permeable skin 
that allows for essential compounds

00:03:00.601 --> 00:03:05.163
to diffuse into and out of their bodies 
while they’re underwater.

00:03:05.163 --> 00:03:09.533
But this works against them on land 
as their bodily moisture

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:11.764
diffuses into the air.

00:03:11.764 --> 00:03:16.975
To dodge dehydration, mudskippers 
roll in the mud like puppies.

00:03:16.975 --> 00:03:19.705
But the lungfish takes the cake:

00:03:19.705 --> 00:03:23.697
the rivers it inhabits disappear 
during dry seasons,

00:03:23.697 --> 00:03:29.752
so it buries itself in the earth
and coats its body in a mucus cocoon.

00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:34.242
It can survive like this for years 
until being resuscitated

00:03:34.242 --> 00:03:37.226
by the next big rainstorm.

00:03:37.226 --> 00:03:41.730
Amphibious fishes use powerful fins 
to move on land

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.380
and clever tools to navigate as they go.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.118
The Nopoli rock-climbing goby, 
no bigger than a few centimeters,

00:03:50.118 --> 00:03:54.078
scales hundred-meter-tall 
Hawaiian waterfalls,

00:03:54.078 --> 00:03:58.281
inching its way up by alternately 
attaching the suction cups

00:03:58.281 --> 00:04:01.441
on its mouth and pelvic fins.

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:04.602
To find water while on land, 
the mummichog,

00:04:04.602 --> 00:04:10.302
like most amphibious fishes, 
is on the lookout for reflective surfaces.

00:04:10.302 --> 00:04:12.982
Other species, like mosquitofish,

00:04:12.982 --> 00:04:18.200
exercise their inner ear to determine 
where they’re oriented on a slope,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.842
relying on the probability that they’ll 
find water by moving downhill.

00:04:23.842 --> 00:04:26.192
Our walking catfish, meanwhile,

00:04:26.192 --> 00:04:30.796
uses the taste buds that coat 
its body for navigation.

00:04:30.796 --> 00:04:33.996
These taste buds are concentrated 
in its whiskers,

00:04:33.996 --> 00:04:35.602
which whip through the air,

00:04:35.602 --> 00:04:39.842
sensing compounds that signal 
the proximity and quality

00:04:39.842 --> 00:04:42.930
of nearby water— and prey.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.309
The walking catfish will shimmy towards 
attractive volatile amino acids

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:54.026
while steering clear of foul waters 
emanating hydrogen sulfide.

00:04:54.026 --> 00:04:59.331
While amphibious fishes face a multitude 
of new challenges upon leaving the water,

00:04:59.331 --> 00:05:02.831
they’ve evolved ingenious ways 
to overcome them.

00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:06.225
They’re resilient in the face 
of droughts and floods

00:05:06.225 --> 00:05:10.115
and have access to new prey 
as well as a plan B

00:05:10.115 --> 00:05:15.663
if they need to escape competitive, 
polluted, or unhealthy environments.

00:05:15.663 --> 00:05:19.893
While being a “fish out of water” 
is generally regarded as a bad thing,

00:05:19.893 --> 00:05:24.029
for these species, 
it offers an undisputed edge.
