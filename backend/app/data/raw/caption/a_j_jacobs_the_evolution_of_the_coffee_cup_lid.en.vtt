00:00:12.073 --> 00:00:13.540
You never give it any thought,

00:00:13.564 --> 00:00:15.845
and there are billions of them out there,

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.416
but the amount of design
and passion and creativity

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.296
that goes into this
little disc is remarkable.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.553
[Small thing.]

00:00:25.577 --> 00:00:27.449
[Big idea.]

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:34.350
The coffee cup lid
is a lid for your coffee cup.

00:00:34.374 --> 00:00:35.711
It snaps on.

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:36.958
It has an opening.

00:00:36.982 --> 00:00:40.479
You've got lids with a little
latch that opens and closes.

00:00:40.503 --> 00:00:43.110
You've got ones that
are in creative shapes.

00:00:43.134 --> 00:00:45.836
Coffee cup lids have their own vocabulary.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.226
People talk about the "peripheral skirts,"

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.206
the "press-in dimples,"
the "fragrance outlets,"

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.596
the "slosh factor."

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.906
But you need these words,

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.066
because so much thought and innovation

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.176
goes into these coffee cup lids.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.196
Our society is just more and more mobile.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.686
Everything is on the move.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.213
The good part: it's convenient.

00:01:04.237 --> 00:01:07.440
You can drink coffee anywhere,
you don't have the stay in the diner.

00:01:07.464 --> 00:01:09.535
It can be in the subway.
You can be walking.

00:01:09.559 --> 00:01:12.606
The bad part is, it's
harder to savor a coffee

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.256
when you're taking it on the road.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.891
The first patent for a lid on a cup

00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:19.196
was in 1934,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.846
but it was for cold beverages.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.206
And in 1950, this guy
named James Reifsnyder

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.146
invented the first snap-on lid.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.906
But it didn't have
an opening for drinking.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.386
In the '60s there was
this huge cultural shift,

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.936
where people started
drinking coffee on the move.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.526
And 7-Eleven was the first
to sell coffee to go.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.819
And then came this revolution in 1967.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.686
A man named
Alan Frank invented a lid

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.696
that you could peel a tab off,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.476
like in the shape of a guitar pick,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.866
and drink it from there.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.316
In 1975, another big advance:

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.946
you could peel back a tab
and attach it to the lid itself.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.540
So, more and more people
started drinking coffee on the go.

00:02:00.564 --> 00:02:06.126
In 1984, a watershed moment
in the history of coffee cup lids:

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.067
the birth of the traveler lid.

00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:11.856
And it is iconic --
you've seen it a million times.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.486
And it solved a whole host of problems.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.406
It's designed so that you
don't splash your face,

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.332
because it's higher than
any of the other ones.

00:02:21.356 --> 00:02:23.576
And it's got this protruding rim,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.686
so it slightly cools the coffee
before it hits your lips.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.326
It's got a small depression
in the center for your nose,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.546
so you can really get in there
and get maximum aroma.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.586
It's got this tiny air hole
that lets the steam out

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.336
and stops it from creating a vacuum.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.186
This is one of those objects
where you just don't notice it

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.726
until it dribbles on your lap.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.007
So I think the coffee cup lid
will just continue to evolve,

00:02:48.031 --> 00:02:51.078
and you're going to see a move
away from single-use plastic lids

00:02:51.102 --> 00:02:53.820
to lids that are
a little more sustainable.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.314
We're not going to stop moving.

00:02:55.314 --> 00:02:57.246
We're not going to stop drinking coffee.

00:02:57.246 --> 00:03:01.202
And I think that's what these coffee
lid engineers are trying to do,

00:03:01.202 --> 00:03:05.988
is to make it so that
the experience of taking it on the road

00:03:05.988 --> 00:03:10.284
is as good as sitting in a restaurant,
drinking from a ceramic cup.

00:03:10.284 --> 00:03:13.192
Because, you know,
coffee is serious business.
