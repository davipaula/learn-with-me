00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:15.096
There is a narrative,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.416
an idea that with resilience,
grit and personal responsibility

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.680
people can pull themselves up
and achieve economic success.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.216
In the United States
we call it the American dream.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.280
A similar narrative
exists all over the world.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.416
But the truth is that the challenges
of making this happen

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.536
have less to do with what we do

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.736
and more to do with the wealth position
in which we are born.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.096
So I'm going to make the case
that the United States government,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.976
actually that any government,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.376
should create a trust account
for every newborn

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.936
of up to 60,000 dollars,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.240
calibrated to the wealth
of the family in which they are born.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.496
I'm talking about an endowment.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.056
Personal seed capital,
a publicly established baby trust,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.536
what my colleague William Darity
at Duke University and I

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.736
have referred to as baby bonds,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.775
a term that was coined by the late
historian from Columbia University,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.496
Manning Marable.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.856
The reason why we should create
these trusts is simple.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.360
Wealth is the paramount indicator
of economic security and well-being.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.256
It provides financial agency,
economic security to take risk

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.416
and shield against loss.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.656
Without capital, inequality is locked in.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.936
We use words like choice, freedom
to describe the benefits of the market,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.720
but it is literally wealth that gives us
choice, freedom and optionality.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.176
Wealthier families are better positioned
to finance an elite, independent school

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.936
and college education,

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.496
access capital to start a business,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.576
finance expensive medical procedures,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.696
reside in neighborhoods
with higher amenities,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.136
exert political influence
through campaign finance,

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.696
purchase better legal counsel

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.176
if confronted with an expensive
criminal justice system,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.696
leave a bequest

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.856
and/or withstand financial hardship
resulting from any number of emergencies.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.376
Basically, when it comes
to economic security,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.080
wealth is both the beginning and the end.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.616
I will frame this conversation
in the context of the United States,

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.016
but this discussion
applies virtually to any country

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.680
facing increasing inequality.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.936
In the US, the top
10 percent of households

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.736
hold about 80 percent
of the nation's wealth

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.960
while the bottom 60 percent
owns only about one percent.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.896
But when it comes to wealth,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.736
race is an even stronger predictor
than class itself.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.216
Blacks and Latinos collectively
make up 30 percent

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.416
of the United States population,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.200
but collectively own about seven percent
of the nation's wealth.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.256
The 2016 survey of consumer finance

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.776
indicates that the typical black family
has about 17,000 dollars in wealth,

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.976
and that's inclusive of home equity,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.936
while the typical white family
has about 170,000.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.136
That is indicative
of an absolute racial wealth gap

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.216
where the typical black household
has about 10 cents for every dollar

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.360
held by the typical white family.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.776
But regardless of race,

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.536
the market alone has been inadequate
to address these inequalities.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.296
Even in times of economic
expansion, inequality grows.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.296
Over the last 45 years,

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.936
wealth disparity
has increased dramatically,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.816
and essentially, all the economic gains
from America's increase in productivity

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.600
have gone to the elite
or the upper middle class.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.216
Yet, much of the framing
around economic disparity

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.576
focuses on the poor choices

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.136
of black, Latino and poor borrowers.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.016
This framing is wrong.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.016
The directional emphasis is wrong.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.256
It is more likely that meager
economic circumstance,

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.176
not poor decision making
or deficient knowledge,

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.096
constrains choice itself
and leaves people with no options

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.656
but to turn to predatory finance.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.856
In essence, education
is not the magic antidote

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.856
for the enormous inherited disparities

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.600
that result from laws,
policies and economic arrangement.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.736
This does not diminish
the value of education.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.136
Indeed, I'm a university professor.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.176
There are clear
intrinsic values to education,

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.616
along with a public responsibility

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.776
to expose everyone
to a high-quality education,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.216
from grade school
all the way through college.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.376
But education is not the panacea.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.296
In fact, blacks who live in families
where the head graduated from college

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.096
typically have less wealth

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.040
than white families
where the head dropped out of high school.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.736
Perhaps we overstate
the functional role of education

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.216
at the detriment of understanding
the functional role of wealth.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.880
Basically, it is wealth
that begets more wealth.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.456
That's why we advocate for baby trust.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.456
An economic birthright
to capital for everyone.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.016
These accounts
would be held in public trust

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.440
to be used as a foundation
to an economically secure life.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.176
The concept of economic rights
is not new nor is it radical.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.536
In 1944, President Franklin Roosevelt

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.096
introduced the idea
of an economic Bill of Rights.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.456
Roosevelt called for physical security,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.720
economic security,
social security and moral security.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.536
Unfortunately, since
the Nixon administration,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.736
the political sentiment
regarding social mobility

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.976
has radically shifted away from
government mandates to economic security

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.696
to a neoliberal approach

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.496
in which the market is presumed
to be the solution for all our problems,

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.240
economic or otherwise.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.000
As a result, the onus of social mobility
has shifted on to the individual.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.056
The pervasive narrative is
that even if your lot in life is subpar,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.576
with perseverance and hard work
and the virtues of the free market,

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.160
you can turn your
proverbial rags into riches.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.656
Of course, the flip side
is that the virtues of the market

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.616
will likewise sanction those
that are not astute,

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.456
those that lack motivation
or those that are simply lazy.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.240
In other words, the deserving poor
will receive their just rewards.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.696
What is glaringly missing
from this narrative

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.376
is the role of power and capital,

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.736
and how that power and capital

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.376
can be used to alter the rules
and structure of transactions and markets

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.816
in the first place.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.296
Power and capital become self-reinforcing.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.256
And without government intervention,

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.576
they generate an iterative cycle
of both stratification and inequality.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.576
The capital finance provided by baby trust

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.176
is intended to deliver a more
egalitarian and an authentic pathway

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.736
to economic security,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.696
independent of the family
financial position

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.856
in which individuals are born.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.376
The program would complement
the economic rights to old-age pensions

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.256
and provide a more comprehensive
social security program,

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.280
designed to provide capital finance
from cradle all the way through grave.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.656
We envision endowing American newborns
with an average account of 25,000 dollars

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.296
that gradually rises
upwards to 60,000 dollars

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.696
for babies born into the poorest families.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.056
Babies born into the wealthiest families

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.856
would be included as well
in the social contract,

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.840
but they would receive a more
nominal account of about 500 dollars.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.056
The accounts would be federally managed,

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.816
and they would grow at a guaranteed
annual interest rate

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.096
of about two percent per year
in order to curtail inflation cost,

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.176
and be used when the child
reaches adulthood

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.696
for some asset-enhancing activity,

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:30.296
like financing a debt-free
university education,

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.656
a down payment to purchase a home,

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.840
or some seed capital to start a business.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.816
With approximately four million babies
born each year in the US,

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.576
if the average endowment of a baby trust
is set at 25,000 dollars,

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.496
the program would crudely cost
about 100 billion dollars a year.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.096
This would constitute

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.616
only about two percent
of current federal expenditures

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.576
and be far less than
the 500-plus billion dollars

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.256
that's already being spent
by the federal government

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.576
on asset promotion
through tax credits and subsidies.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.496
At issue is not the amount
of that allocation

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.296
but to whom it's distributed.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.616
Currently, the top
one percent of households,

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.776
those earning above 100 million dollars,

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.336
receive only about one third
of this entire allocation,

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.600
while the bottom 60 percent
receive only five percent.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.896
If the federal asset-promoting budget

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.536
were allocated
in a more progressive manner,

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.760
federal policies could be
transformative for all Americans.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.416
This is a work in progress.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.776
There are obviously many details
to be worked out,

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.416
but it is a policy proposal
grounded in the functional roles

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.856
and the inherited advantages of wealth

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.976
that moves us away
from the reinforcing status quo

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.576
behavioral explanations for inequality

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.760
towards more structural solutions.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.696
Our existing tax policy
that privileges existing wealth

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.000
rather than establishing
new wealth is a choice.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:12.096
The extent of our dramatic inequality
is at least as much a problem of politics

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.080
as it is a problem of economics.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.656
It is time to get beyond
the false narratives

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.776
that attribute inequality
to individual personal deficits

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.480
while largely ignoring
the advantages of wealth.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.896
Instead, public provisions of a baby trust

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.576
could go a long way towards eliminating

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.616
the transmission of economic advantage
or disadvantage across generations

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.296
and establishing a more moral
and decent economy

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.336
that facilitates assets, economic security

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.056
and social mobility for all its citizens.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.976
Regardless of the race

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.176
and the family positions
in which they are born.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.536
Thank you very much.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.976
(Applause)

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.976
Chris Anderson: Darrick.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.456
I mean, there's so much
to like in this idea.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.256
There's one piece of branding around it
that I worry about,

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.856
which is just that right now,
trust-fund kids have a really bad rap.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.136
You know, they're the sort of
eyeball-rolling poster children

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.296
for how money, kind of,
takes away motivation.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.696
So, these trusts are different.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:34.216
So how do you show people in this proposal
that it's not going to do that?

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.896
Darrick Hamilton: If you know
you have limited resources

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.778
or you're going to face discrimination,

00:11:38.802 --> 00:11:40.416
there's a narrative that, well,

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.696
the economic returns
to investing in myself

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.496
are lower than that of someone else,

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.256
so I might as well enjoy my leisure.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.416
Of course, there's another
narrative as well,

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.576
so we shouldn't get caught up on that,

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.416
you know, somebody who's poor
and going to face discrimination,

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.256
they also might pursue
a resume-building strategy.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.816
The old adage, "I have to be
twice as good as someone else."

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.296
Now, when we say that,
we never ask at what cost,

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.656
are there health costs
associated with that.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.816
I haven't answered your question,
but coming back to you question,

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:14.056
if you know you're going to receive
a transfer at a later point in life,

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.176
that only increases the incentive
for you to invest in yourself

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.040
so that you can better use that trust.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.416
CA: You're giving people
possibilities of life

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.976
they currently cannot imagine having.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.936
And therefore the motivation to do that.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.976
I could talk with you
for hours about this.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.896
I'm really glad you're working on this.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.136
Thank you.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.600
(Applause)
