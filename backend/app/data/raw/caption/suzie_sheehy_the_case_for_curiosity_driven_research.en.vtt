00:00:12.873 --> 00:00:17.633
In the late 19th century,
scientists were trying to solve a mystery.

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:21.768
They found that if they had
a vacuum tube like this one

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:24.419
and applied a high voltage across it,

00:00:24.443 --> 00:00:26.158
something strange happened.

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.086
They called them cathode rays.

00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:42.329
But the question was:
What were they made of?

00:00:42.858 --> 00:00:46.731
In England, the 19th-century
physicist J.J. Thompson

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:51.022
conducted experiments using
magnets and electricity, like this.

00:00:57.552 --> 00:01:00.218
And he came to an incredible revelation.

00:01:00.956 --> 00:01:04.490
These rays were made
of negatively charged particles

00:01:04.514 --> 00:01:08.506
around 2,000 times lighter
than the hydrogen atom,

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.339
the smallest thing they knew.

00:01:10.673 --> 00:01:14.887
So Thompson had discovered
the first subatomic particle,

00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:16.777
which we now call electrons.

00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:21.394
Now, at the time, this seemed to be
a completely impractical discovery.

00:01:21.418 --> 00:01:24.990
I mean, Thompson didn't think
there were any applications of electrons.

00:01:25.653 --> 00:01:29.926
Around his lab in Cambridge,
he used to like to propose a toast:

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.299
"To the electron.

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:33.473
May it never be of use to anybody."

00:01:33.497 --> 00:01:35.528
(Laughter)

00:01:36.085 --> 00:01:40.006
He was strongly in favor of doing research
out of sheer curiosity,

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.363
to arrive at a deeper
understanding of the world.

00:01:43.696 --> 00:01:47.680
And what he found
did cause a revolution in science.

00:01:47.704 --> 00:01:52.605
But it also caused a second,
unexpected revolution in technology.

00:01:53.582 --> 00:01:57.915
Today, I'd like to make a case
for curiosity-driven research,

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.375
because without it,

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.895
none of the technologies
I'll talk about today

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:03.585
would have been possible.

00:02:04.077 --> 00:02:08.768
Now, what Thompson found here
has actually changed our view of reality.

00:02:08.792 --> 00:02:11.680
I mean, I think I'm standing on a stage,

00:02:11.704 --> 00:02:13.744
and you think you're sitting in a seat.

00:02:13.768 --> 00:02:15.792
But that's just the electrons in your body

00:02:15.816 --> 00:02:18.585
pushing back against
the electrons in the seat,

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:20.609
opposing the force of gravity.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.990
You're not even really touching the seat.

00:02:24.014 --> 00:02:27.855
You're hovering ever so slightly above it.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.061
But in many ways, our modern society
was actually built on this discovery.

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:35.585
I mean, these tubes
were the start of electronics.

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.103
And then for many years,

00:02:37.127 --> 00:02:40.839
most of us actually had one of these,
if you remember, in your living room,

00:02:40.863 --> 00:02:42.996
in cathode-ray tube televisions.

00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:46.609
But -- I mean, how impoverished
would our lives be

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:50.143
if the only invention that had come
from here was the television?

00:02:50.167 --> 00:02:52.363
(Laughter)

00:02:52.387 --> 00:02:55.069
Thankfully, this tube was just a start,

00:02:55.093 --> 00:02:57.828
because something else happens
when the electrons here

00:02:57.852 --> 00:03:00.188
hit the piece of metal inside the tube.

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:01.362
Let me show you.

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.999
Pop this one back on.

00:03:07.163 --> 00:03:10.194
So as the electrons
screech to a halt inside the metal,

00:03:10.218 --> 00:03:12.393
their energy gets thrown out again

00:03:12.417 --> 00:03:16.063
in a form of high-energy light,
which we call X-rays.

00:03:16.087 --> 00:03:18.697
(Buzzing)

00:03:19.793 --> 00:03:20.943
(Buzzing)

00:03:21.661 --> 00:03:24.887
And within 15 years
of discovering the electron,

00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:29.506
these X-rays were being used
to make images inside the human body,

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.822
helping soldiers' lives
being saved by surgeons,

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:37.458
who could then find pieces of bullets
and shrapnel inside their bodies.

00:03:38.236 --> 00:03:41.221
But there's no way we could have
come up with that technology

00:03:41.245 --> 00:03:44.618
by asking scientists to build
better surgical probes.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.101
Only research done out of sheer curiosity,
with no application in mind,

00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:54.021
could have given us the discovery
of the electron and X-rays.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.061
Now, this tube also threw open the gates
for our understanding of the universe

00:04:00.085 --> 00:04:02.283
and the field of particle physics,

00:04:02.307 --> 00:04:06.860
because it's also the first,
very simple particle accelerator.

00:04:07.785 --> 00:04:11.959
Now, I'm an accelerator physicist,
so I design particle accelerators,

00:04:11.983 --> 00:04:14.493
and I try and understand how beams behave.

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:16.953
And my field's a bit unusual,

00:04:16.977 --> 00:04:20.649
because it crosses between
curiosity-driven research

00:04:20.673 --> 00:04:23.949
and technology with
real-world applications.

00:04:24.586 --> 00:04:26.689
But it's the combination
of those two things

00:04:26.713 --> 00:04:29.920
that gets me really excited
about what I do.

00:04:30.704 --> 00:04:32.435
Now, over the last 100 years,

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:35.368
there have been far too many examples
for me to list them all.

00:04:35.392 --> 00:04:37.545
But I want to share with you just a few.

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:43.300
In 1928, a physicist named Paul Dirac
found something strange in his equations.

00:04:43.938 --> 00:04:48.343
And he predicted, based purely
on mathematical insight,

00:04:48.367 --> 00:04:51.137
that there ought to be
a second kind of matter,

00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:53.339
the opposite to normal matter,

00:04:53.363 --> 00:04:56.830
that literally annihilates
when it comes in contact:

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:58.529
antimatter.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.974
I mean, the idea sounded ridiculous.

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:04.823
But within four years, they'd found it.

00:05:04.847 --> 00:05:07.133
And nowadays, we use it
every day in hospitals,

00:05:07.157 --> 00:05:11.876
in positron emission tomography,
or PET scans, used for detecting disease.

00:05:13.655 --> 00:05:15.321
Or, take these X-rays.

00:05:15.861 --> 00:05:18.385
If you can get these electrons
up to a higher energy,

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:21.136
so about 1,000 times higher
than this tube,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.985
the X-rays that those produce

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:27.886
can actually deliver enough
ionizing radiation to kill human cells.

00:05:28.588 --> 00:05:32.045
And if you can shape and direct
those X-rays where you want them to go,

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:35.053
that allows us to do an incredible thing:

00:05:35.077 --> 00:05:38.156
to treat cancer without drugs or surgery,

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.244
which we call radiotherapy.

00:05:40.268 --> 00:05:42.990
In countries like Australia and the UK,

00:05:43.014 --> 00:05:47.450
around half of all cancer patients
are treated using radiotherapy.

00:05:47.474 --> 00:05:51.489
And so, electron accelerators
are actually standard equipment

00:05:51.513 --> 00:05:52.713
in most hospitals.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.998
Or, a little closer to home:

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:58.556
if you have a smartphone or a computer --

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.881
and this is TEDx, so you've got
both with you right now, right?

00:06:03.855 --> 00:06:05.915
Well, inside those devices

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.956
are chips that are made
by implanting single ions into silicon,

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.252
in a process called ion implantation.

00:06:13.617 --> 00:06:16.664
And that uses a particle accelerator.

00:06:18.546 --> 00:06:22.268
Without curiosity-driven research, though,

00:06:22.292 --> 00:06:26.021
none of these things would exist at all.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:33.485
So, over the years, we really learned
to explore inside the atom.

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:37.672
And to do that, we had to learn
to develop particle accelerators.

00:06:37.696 --> 00:06:41.085
The first ones we developed
let us split the atom.

00:06:41.474 --> 00:06:44.980
And then we got to higher
and higher energies;

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:49.307
we created circular accelerators
that let us delve into the nucleus

00:06:49.331 --> 00:06:52.851
and then create new elements, even.

00:06:53.717 --> 00:06:58.077
And at that point, we were no longer
just exploring inside the atom.

00:06:58.542 --> 00:07:01.280
We'd actually learned
how to control these particles.

00:07:01.304 --> 00:07:03.926
We'd learned how to interact
with our world

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.513
on a scale that's too small
for humans to see or touch

00:07:08.537 --> 00:07:10.839
or even sense that it's there.

00:07:12.276 --> 00:07:16.011
And then we built larger
and larger accelerators,

00:07:16.035 --> 00:07:19.609
because we were curious
about the nature of the universe.

00:07:19.633 --> 00:07:24.307
As we went deeper and deeper,
new particles started popping up.

00:07:24.823 --> 00:07:27.744
Eventually, we got to huge
ring-like machines

00:07:27.768 --> 00:07:31.175
that take two beams of particles
in opposite directions,

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:33.667
squeeze them down
to less than the width of a hair

00:07:33.691 --> 00:07:35.452
and smash them together.

00:07:35.476 --> 00:07:38.068
And then, using Einstein's E=mc2,

00:07:38.092 --> 00:07:42.252
you can take all of that energy
and convert it into new matter,

00:07:42.276 --> 00:07:47.736
new particles which we rip
from the very fabric of the universe.

00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:53.199
Nowadays, there are
about 35,000 accelerators in the world,

00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:54.772
not including televisions.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.990
And inside each one of these
incredible machines,

00:07:59.014 --> 00:08:02.633
there are hundreds of billions
of tiny particles,

00:08:02.657 --> 00:08:06.379
dancing and swirling in systems
that are more complex

00:08:06.403 --> 00:08:08.695
than the formation of galaxies.

00:08:08.719 --> 00:08:12.120
You guys, I can't even begin to explain
how incredible it is

00:08:12.144 --> 00:08:13.614
that we can do this.

00:08:14.125 --> 00:08:16.125
(Laughter)

00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:19.440
(Applause)

00:08:23.531 --> 00:08:27.592
So I want to encourage you
to invest your time and energy

00:08:27.616 --> 00:08:31.386
in people that do
curiosity-driven research.

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:34.599
It was Jonathan Swift who once said,

00:08:34.623 --> 00:08:37.783
"Vision is the art
of seeing the invisible."

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.195
And over a century ago,
J.J. Thompson did just that,

00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:44.632
when he pulled back the veil
on the subatomic world.

00:08:45.965 --> 00:08:49.568
And now we need to invest
in curiosity-driven research,

00:08:49.592 --> 00:08:52.537
because we have so many
challenges that we face.

00:08:52.561 --> 00:08:54.472
And we need patience;

00:08:54.496 --> 00:08:58.028
we need to give scientists the time,
the space and the means

00:08:58.052 --> 00:09:00.338
to continue their quest,

00:09:00.362 --> 00:09:02.490
because history tells us

00:09:02.514 --> 00:09:05.672
that if we can remain
curious and open-minded

00:09:05.696 --> 00:09:08.061
about the outcomes of research,

00:09:08.085 --> 00:09:10.998
the more world-changing
our discoveries will be.

00:09:11.397 --> 00:09:12.547
Thank you.

00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:15.309
(Applause)
