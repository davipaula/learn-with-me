00:00:07.063 --> 00:00:09.943
Imagine a future where nobody dies—

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:13.943
instead, our minds are uploaded 
to a digital world.

00:00:13.943 --> 00:00:18.473
They might live on in a realistic,
simulated environment with avatar bodies,

00:00:18.473 --> 00:00:23.153
and could still call in and contribute 
to the biological world.

00:00:23.153 --> 00:00:26.244
Mind uploading has powerful appeal—

00:00:26.244 --> 00:00:31.674
but what would it actually take to scan a 
person’s brain and upload their mind?

00:00:31.674 --> 00:00:36.226
The main challenges are scanning a brain 
in enough detail to capture the mind

00:00:36.226 --> 00:00:40.634
and perfectly recreating 
that detail artificially.

00:00:40.634 --> 00:00:43.314
But first, we have to know what to scan.

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:46.684
The human brain contains 
about 86 billion neurons,

00:00:46.684 --> 00:00:50.314
connected by at least a 
hundred trillion synapses.

00:00:50.314 --> 00:00:53.384
The pattern of connectivity 
among the brain’s neurons,

00:00:53.384 --> 00:00:57.504
that is, all of the neurons and 
all their connections to each other,

00:00:57.504 --> 00:00:59.703
is called the connectome.

00:00:59.703 --> 00:01:01.913
We haven’t yet mapped 
the connectome,

00:01:01.913 --> 00:01:04.933
and there’s also a lot more 
to neural signaling.

00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:08.663
There are hundreds, possibly thousands 
of different kinds of connections,

00:01:08.663 --> 00:01:10.263
or synapses.

00:01:10.263 --> 00:01:12.903
Each functions in a slightly 
different way.

00:01:12.903 --> 00:01:14.943
Some work faster, some slower.

00:01:14.943 --> 00:01:18.713
Some grow or shrink rapidly in 
the process of learning;

00:01:18.713 --> 00:01:20.903
some are more stable over time.

00:01:20.903 --> 00:01:25.593
And beyond the trillions of precise, 
1-to-1 connections between neurons,

00:01:25.593 --> 00:01:28.956
some neurons also spray out 
neurotransmitters

00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:31.726
that affect many other neurons at once.

00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:33.966
All of these different kinds of 
interactions

00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:37.876
would need to be mapped in order to 
copy a person’s mind.

00:01:37.876 --> 00:01:40.866
There are also a lot of influences on 
neural signaling

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:44.206
that are poorly understood 
or undiscovered.

00:01:44.206 --> 00:01:45.776
To name just one example,

00:01:45.776 --> 00:01:48.086
patterns of activity between neurons

00:01:48.086 --> 00:01:52.156
are likely influenced by a type 
of cell called glia.

00:01:52.156 --> 00:01:55.853
Glia surround neurons and, 
according to some scientists,

00:01:55.853 --> 00:01:59.503
may even outnumber them 
by as many as ten to one.

00:01:59.503 --> 00:02:03.133
Glia were once thought to be purely 
for structural support,

00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:05.983
and their functions are still 
poorly understood,

00:02:05.983 --> 00:02:09.133
but at least some of them can generate 
their own signals

00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:11.753
that influence information processing.

00:02:11.753 --> 00:02:14.893
Our understanding of the brain isn’t good 
enough to determine

00:02:14.893 --> 00:02:17.933
what we’d need to scan in order 
to replicate the mind,

00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:20.943
but assuming our knowledge does 
advance to that point,

00:02:20.943 --> 00:02:22.373
how would we scan it?

00:02:22.373 --> 00:02:25.863
Currently, we can accurately scan a living
human brain

00:02:25.863 --> 00:02:28.423
with resolutions of about half a 
millimeter

00:02:28.423 --> 00:02:32.243
using our best non-invasive 
scanning method, MRI.

00:02:32.243 --> 00:02:37.733
To detect a synapse, we’ll need to scan 
at a resolution of about a micron—

00:02:37.733 --> 00:02:39.693
a thousandth of a millimeter.

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:44.693
To distinguish the kind of synapse and 
precisely how strong each synapse is,

00:02:44.693 --> 00:02:47.074
we’ll need even better resolution.

00:02:47.074 --> 00:02:50.044
MRI depends on powerful magnetic fields.

00:02:50.044 --> 00:02:51.924
Scanning at the resolution required

00:02:51.924 --> 00:02:55.114
to determine the details of 
individual synapses

00:02:55.114 --> 00:02:59.734
would requires a field strength high 
enough to cook a person’s tissues.

00:02:59.734 --> 00:03:01.766
So this kind of leap in resolution

00:03:01.766 --> 00:03:05.056
would require fundamentally 
new scanning technology.

00:03:05.056 --> 00:03:09.636
It would be more feasible to scan a dead
brain using an electron microscope,

00:03:09.636 --> 00:03:13.236
but even that technology is nowhere 
near good enough–

00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:16.526
and requires killing the subject first.

00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:20.676
Assuming we eventually understand the 
brain well enough to know what to scan

00:03:20.676 --> 00:03:24.126
and develop the technology to safely 
scan at that resolution,

00:03:24.126 --> 00:03:28.536
the next challenge would be to recreate 
that information digitally.

00:03:28.536 --> 00:03:33.266
The main obstacles to doing so are 
computing power and storage space,

00:03:33.266 --> 00:03:35.764
both of which are improving every year.

00:03:35.764 --> 00:03:39.524
We’re actually much closer to attaining 
this technological capacity

00:03:39.524 --> 00:03:43.794
than we are to understanding or scanning 
our own minds.

00:03:43.794 --> 00:03:47.834
Artificial neural networks already run 
our internet search engines,

00:03:47.834 --> 00:03:52.418
digital assistants, self-driving cars, 
Wall Street trading algorithms,

00:03:52.418 --> 00:03:53.792
and smart phones.

00:03:53.792 --> 00:03:57.902
Nobody has yet built an artificial network
with 86 billion neurons,

00:03:57.902 --> 00:04:00.332
but as computing technology improves,

00:04:00.332 --> 00:04:04.712
it may be possible to keep track 
of such massive data sets.

00:04:04.712 --> 00:04:08.170
At every step in the scanning and 
uploading process,

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.840
we’d have to be certain we were capturing 
all the necessary information accurately—

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.297
or there’s no telling what ruined 
version of a mind might emerge.

00:04:18.297 --> 00:04:21.083
While mind uploading is 
theoretically possible,

00:04:21.083 --> 00:04:22.933
we’re likely hundreds of years away

00:04:22.933 --> 00:04:25.823
from the technology
and scientific understanding

00:04:25.823 --> 00:04:27.273
that would make it a reality.

00:04:27.273 --> 00:04:31.523
And that reality would come with ethical 
and philosophical considerations:

00:04:31.523 --> 00:04:34.333
who would have access to mind uploading?

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:37.213
What rights would be accorded to 
uploaded minds?

00:04:37.213 --> 00:04:39.973
How could this technology be abused?

00:04:39.636 --> 00:04:42.436
Even if we can eventually upload 
our minds,

00:04:42.436 --> 00:04:45.546
whether we should remains 
an open question.
