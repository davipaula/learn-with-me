00:00:06.984 --> 00:00:09.319
Wars are a tragic part of our history

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:12.502
and will almost certainly be a tragic part of our future.

00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:16.058
Since the establishment of the United Nations,

00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:17.765
wars of aggression have been outlawed

00:00:17.765 --> 00:00:20.909
and multilateral conventions refer to armed conflict

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:22.964
instead of war.

00:00:22.964 --> 00:00:24.449
But the wars of the future

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.661
won't be like the wars of our past.

00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:28.389
Alongside traditional warfare,

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:30.933
our future will include cyberwarfare,

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:32.547
remotely fighting our enemies

00:00:32.547 --> 00:00:34.813
through the use of a new class of weapons,

00:00:34.813 --> 00:00:36.342
including computer viruses

00:00:36.342 --> 00:00:39.928
and programs to alter the enemy's ability to operate.

00:00:39.928 --> 00:00:42.354
And not only is cyberwarfare not covered

00:00:42.354 --> 00:00:44.392
by existing legal frameworks,

00:00:44.392 --> 00:00:47.642
but the question of what exactly constitutes cyberwarfare

00:00:47.642 --> 00:00:49.645
is still highly debated.

00:00:49.645 --> 00:00:51.646
So, how can we deal with cyberwarfare

00:00:51.646 --> 00:00:54.358
if we can't even agree on what it means?

00:00:54.358 --> 00:00:56.733
One way forward is to envision situations

00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:59.644
where new international laws may be needed.

00:00:59.644 --> 00:01:01.564
Imagine a new kind of assassin,

00:01:01.564 --> 00:01:03.308
one that could perpetrate a crime

00:01:03.308 --> 00:01:04.920
without firing a single shot

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.026
or even being in the same country.

00:01:07.026 --> 00:01:09.830
For example, an individual working for the government

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.258
uses a wireless device to send a signal

00:01:12.258 --> 00:01:14.500
to another foreign leader's pacemaker.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.065
This device directs the pacemaker to malfunction,

00:01:17.065 --> 00:01:20.230
ultimately resulting in the foreign leader's death.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.719
Would this cyber assassination

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:23.764
constitute an act of war?

00:01:23.764 --> 00:01:25.114
As a second example,

00:01:25.114 --> 00:01:27.202
imagine an allied group of nations

00:01:27.202 --> 00:01:29.577
cooperatively infiltrating the computer systems

00:01:29.577 --> 00:01:32.143
of an enemy nation's nuclear warship.

00:01:32.143 --> 00:01:35.517
This attack results in a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier

00:01:35.517 --> 00:01:36.816
almost melting down,

00:01:36.816 --> 00:01:38.327
which was stopped just short

00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:41.187
of killing thousands of soldiers and civilians.

00:01:41.187 --> 00:01:42.407
As a defensive measure,

00:01:42.407 --> 00:01:43.878
the enemy country responds

00:01:43.878 --> 00:01:46.187
by unleashing a defensive cyberattack

00:01:46.187 --> 00:01:49.871
that results in the allied nations' power grids going down.

00:01:49.871 --> 00:01:52.042
Hospitals can no longer treat patients,

00:01:52.042 --> 00:01:54.967
entire regions without heat or clean water,

00:01:54.967 --> 00:01:59.462
all ultimately causing tens of thousands civilian deaths.

00:01:59.462 --> 00:02:01.016
The origin of the power failure

00:02:01.016 --> 00:02:02.227
was the counterattack,

00:02:02.227 --> 00:02:03.892
but the fragile infrastructure,

00:02:03.892 --> 00:02:05.393
feeble cybersecurity,

00:02:05.393 --> 00:02:07.682
and the antiquated state of the power grid

00:02:07.682 --> 00:02:10.475
all contributed to the deaths of the civilians.

00:02:10.475 --> 00:02:11.813
Could the country fight back?

00:02:11.813 --> 00:02:13.403
Who would they fight?

00:02:13.403 --> 00:02:16.598
And would their retaliation be considered an act of war?

00:02:16.598 --> 00:02:19.812
Do they constitute war crimes against humanity?

00:02:19.812 --> 00:02:21.826
Who is to be held responsible?

00:02:21.826 --> 00:02:24.585
The computer programmers who wrote the code?

00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:26.362
The military project manager

00:02:26.362 --> 00:02:28.704
who oversaw the creation of the code?

00:02:28.704 --> 00:02:30.395
The commander who hit the button,

00:02:30.395 --> 00:02:32.248
setting off the event?

00:02:32.248 --> 00:02:34.635
The hardware engineer who created the computers,

00:02:34.635 --> 00:02:37.850
knowing that they were intended to enable an attack?

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.297
Because war has been with us for so long,

00:02:40.297 --> 00:02:42.144
we have laws to deal with figuring out

00:02:42.144 --> 00:02:43.562
who should be held accountable

00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:45.178
for their actions in combat.

00:02:46.116 --> 00:02:48.223
These legal frameworks aim to contain

00:02:48.223 --> 00:02:51.503
and prevent atrocities from being more atrocious.

00:02:51.503 --> 00:02:53.224
Commandeering civilian planes

00:02:53.224 --> 00:02:54.771
and using them as weapons,

00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:56.794
dropping atomic bombs,

00:02:56.794 --> 00:03:00.419
the use of gas chambers or poisonous gas in conflict,

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.361
all of these actions, if committed,

00:03:02.361 --> 00:03:04.784
constitute acts of war and war crimes

00:03:04.784 --> 00:03:07.092
under customary international law

00:03:07.092 --> 00:03:08.840
and the Hague conventions.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.587
Again, the current legal framework stays silent

00:03:11.587 --> 00:03:14.069
on hypothetical questions and countless others

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.433
because there are no easy answers,

00:03:16.433 --> 00:03:17.628
and there are only two ways

00:03:17.628 --> 00:03:19.640
to make progress on these questions:

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.724
peace or new laws.

00:03:21.724 --> 00:03:24.200
So, what hypothetical but plausible scenarios

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.925
can you imagine falling under

00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:28.336
the burgeoning definition of cyberwarfare,

00:03:28.336 --> 00:03:29.558
and how might you design

00:03:29.558 --> 00:03:31.229
an international legal framework

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:33.342
to deter these activities?
