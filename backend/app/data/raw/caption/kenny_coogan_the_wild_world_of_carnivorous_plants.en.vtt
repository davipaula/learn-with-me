00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:09.281
Little do they know it,

00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:15.721
but these six creatures are each about to
experience a very unusual death.

00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:16.621
One-by-one,

00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:20.451
they will fall prey to the remarkable, 
predatory antics of...

00:00:20.451 --> 00:00:22.921
a carnivorous plant.

00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:26.391
Around the world there are more than 
600 plant species

00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:30.571
that supplement a regular 
diet of sunlight, water, and soil

00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:35.758
with insects, microbes, 
or even frogs and rats.

00:00:35.758 --> 00:00:40.338
Scientists believe that carnivory in 
plants evolved separately

00:00:40.338 --> 00:00:42.923
at least six times on our planet,

00:00:42.923 --> 00:00:45.943
suggesting that this flesh-munching 
adaptation

00:00:45.943 --> 00:00:48.873
holds a major benefit for plants.

00:00:48.873 --> 00:00:53.413
Carnivorous plants tend to grow in places 
with highly acidic soil,

00:00:53.413 --> 00:00:59.411
which is poor in crucial nutrients 
like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.

00:00:59.411 --> 00:01:01.728
In these hostile conditions,

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:05.918
plants that are able to lure, trap, 
and digest prey

00:01:05.918 --> 00:01:10.667
have an advantage over those that rely 
on soil for their nutrients.

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:13.285
Take this inhospitable bog,

00:01:13.285 --> 00:01:15.795
where pitcher plants reign supreme.

00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:19.385
Drawn to the pitcher’s vivid colors 
and alluring scent,

00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:22.715
the fly closes in and slurps its nectar.

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:27.655
But this pitcher species has an ingredient
called coniine in its nectar,

00:01:27.655 --> 00:01:30.705
a powerful narcotic to insects.

00:01:30.705 --> 00:01:32.735
As the coniine takes effect,

00:01:32.735 --> 00:01:37.235
the fly grows sluggish, stumbles, 
and falls down the funnel

00:01:37.235 --> 00:01:39.691
into a pool of liquid at the base,

00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:41.981
where he drowns.

00:01:41.981 --> 00:01:46.261
Enzymes and bacteria in the liquid slowly
break his body down

00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:51.899
into microscopic particles the pitcher 
plant can consume through its leaves.

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:52.646
Occasionally,

00:01:52.646 --> 00:01:57.726
larger prey also tumbles into the 
fatal funnel of the pitcher plant.

00:01:57.726 --> 00:02:02.113
The second victim faces off with the 
sticky sundew plant.

00:02:02.113 --> 00:02:08.034
The sundew’s tiny leaves are equipped with
a viscous secretion called mucilage.

00:02:08.034 --> 00:02:11.094
The ant is swiftly trapped in this goo.

00:02:11.094 --> 00:02:15.134
As she struggles, enzymes begin 
to digest her body.

00:02:15.138 --> 00:02:19.428
Special tentacles sense her movement 
and curl around her,

00:02:19.428 --> 00:02:22.004
clenching her in their suffocating grip.

00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:23.484
Once she asphyxiates,

00:02:23.484 --> 00:02:25.784
which can happen in under an hour,

00:02:25.784 --> 00:02:30.384
the tentacles unfurl again 
to snare their next victim.

00:02:30.384 --> 00:02:32.188
Two down, four to go.

00:02:32.188 --> 00:02:35.478
The next target meets his end underground,

00:02:35.478 --> 00:02:38.298
in the coils of the corkscrew plant.

00:02:38.298 --> 00:02:42.398
He enters the roots through a tiny slit
in search of food.

00:02:42.398 --> 00:02:47.260
But inside, he quickly loses his way 
through the tangled labyrinth.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.936
A forest of curved hairs 
prevents his escape,

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:55.606
guiding him into a central chamber
with flesh-digesting enzymes

00:02:55.606 --> 00:02:59.777
and deadly low levels of oxygen.

00:02:59.777 --> 00:03:02.369
In the murky depths of a nearby pond,

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:07.289
a tadpole unwittingly swims into the path
of the bladderwort,

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:10.374
the speediest of all carnivorous plants.

00:03:10.374 --> 00:03:13.274
She treads on the bladderwort’s trigger,

00:03:13.274 --> 00:03:14.454
and in milliseconds,

00:03:14.454 --> 00:03:17.974
a trapdoor swings open and sucks her in.

00:03:17.974 --> 00:03:20.114
Trapped half in and half out,

00:03:20.114 --> 00:03:22.294
she struggles to free herself

00:03:22.294 --> 00:03:27.304
while the part of her body inside 
the plant gets digested.

00:03:27.304 --> 00:03:28.935
Over the next few hours,

00:03:28.935 --> 00:03:31.655
her writhing sets the trap off repeatedly,

00:03:31.655 --> 00:03:34.295
each time bringing her deeper 
into the plant

00:03:34.295 --> 00:03:38.135
to be digested alive bit by bit.

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:42.375
Meanwhile, this beetle is bewitched by 
sweet-smelling nectar.

00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:44.735
The scent draws him closer and closer

00:03:44.735 --> 00:03:50.145
until he lands on the leaves of the 
world’s most infamous carnivorous plant.

00:03:50.145 --> 00:03:54.335
His landing triggers tiny hairs on the 
surface of the leaves,

00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:58.725
and the jaws of the venus fly trap 
snap shut around him.

00:03:58.725 --> 00:04:01.795
The spikes interlock to seal his fate.

00:04:01.795 --> 00:04:02.825
Once closed,

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:08.915
the leaves act like an external stomach
that digests the beetle’s soft tissues.

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.195
When they open again a few days later,

00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:15.385
only the dry husk of his 
exoskeleton remains.

00:04:15.385 --> 00:04:18.854
The mayfly is the last creature standing.

00:04:18.854 --> 00:04:21.504
As she approaches the butterwort plant,

00:04:21.504 --> 00:04:27.374
she heads for the flowers that wave high
above the plant’s globs of adhesive goo.

00:04:27.374 --> 00:04:32.600
She alights on the petals, drinks the 
nectar, and takes off unscathed.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.814
These long flower stalks keep certain 
insects away from the carnivore’s traps—

00:04:37.814 --> 00:04:41.864
a way of separating pollinators from food.

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:46.816
Off the mayfly buzzes 
to live a long and fruitful life–

00:04:46.816 --> 00:04:48.286
oh.
