00:00:12.626 --> 00:00:15.393
Now, people have a lot
of misconceptions about science --

00:00:15.417 --> 00:00:17.768
about how it works and what it is.

00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:21.226
A big one is that science
is just a big old pile of facts.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.250
But that's not true --
that's not even the goal of science.

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:27.393
Science is a process.

00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:29.601
It's a way of thinking.

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:32.518
Gathering facts is just a piece of it,
but it's not the goal.

00:00:32.542 --> 00:00:37.309
The ultimate goal of science
is to understand objective reality

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:38.768
the best way we know how,

00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:41.309
and that's based on evidence.

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:44.018
The problem here
is that people are flawed.

00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:45.351
We can be fooled --

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:47.684
we're really good at fooling ourselves.

00:00:47.708 --> 00:00:52.208
And so baked into this process
is a way of minimizing our own bias.

00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:56.434
So sort of boiled down
more than is probably useful,

00:00:56.458 --> 00:00:57.750
here's how this works.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.268
If you want to do some science,

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:02.934
what you want to do
is you want to observe something ...

00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.976
say, "The sky is blue. Hey, I wonder why?"

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.393
You question it.

00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:10.726
The next thing you do is you come up
with an idea that may explain it:

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.018
a hypothesis.

00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:13.934
Well, you know what? Oceans are blue.

00:01:13.958 --> 00:01:16.917
Maybe the sky is reflecting
the colors from the ocean.

00:01:17.917 --> 00:01:19.934
Great, but now you have to test it

00:01:19.958 --> 00:01:22.601
so you predict what that might mean.

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:23.893
Your prediction would be,

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:26.226
"Well, if the sky is reflecting
the ocean color,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.268
it will be bluer on the coasts

00:01:28.292 --> 00:01:30.726
than it will be
in the middle of the country."

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.309
OK, that's fair enough,

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:34.184
but you've got to test that prediction

00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:37.976
so you get on a plane,
you leave Denver on a nice gray day,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.601
you fly to LA, you look up
and the sky is gloriously blue.

00:01:41.625 --> 00:01:43.750
Hooray, your thesis is proven.

00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:46.434
But is it really? No.

00:01:46.458 --> 00:01:48.184
You've made one observation.

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:51.393
You need to think about your hypothesis,
think about how to test it

00:01:51.417 --> 00:01:53.059
and do more than just one.

00:01:53.083 --> 00:01:55.643
Maybe you could go
to a different part of the country

00:01:55.667 --> 00:01:57.184
or a different part of the year

00:01:57.208 --> 00:01:59.268
and see what the weather's like then.

00:01:59.292 --> 00:02:01.976
Another good idea
is to talk to other people.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.601
They have different ideas,
different perspectives,

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:05.851
and they can help you.

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:08.268
This is what we call peer review.

00:02:08.292 --> 00:02:11.976
And in fact that will probably also
save you a lot of money and a lot of time,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.292
flying coast-to-coast
just to check the weather.

00:02:15.542 --> 00:02:21.809
Now, what happens if your hypothesis
does a decent job but not a perfect job?

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:23.101
Well, that's OK,

00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:25.934
because what you can do
is you can modify it a little bit

00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.351
and then go through
this whole process again --

00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:30.268
make predictions, test them --

00:02:30.292 --> 00:02:33.351
and as you do that over and over again,
you will hone this idea.

00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:34.768
And if it gets good enough,

00:02:34.792 --> 00:02:37.143
it may be accepted
by the scientific community,

00:02:37.167 --> 00:02:38.434
at least provisionally,

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:41.393
as a good explanation of what's going on,

00:02:41.417 --> 00:02:43.434
at least until a better idea

00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:45.625
or some contradictory
evidence comes along.

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:51.042
Now, part of this process
is admitting when you're wrong.

00:02:51.792 --> 00:02:54.125
And that can be really, really hard.

00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:56.893
Science has its strengths and weaknesses

00:02:56.917 --> 00:02:59.101
and they depend on this.

00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:02.351
One of the strengths of science
is that it's done by people,

00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:04.601
and it's proven itself
to do a really good job.

00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:07.393
We understand the universe
pretty well because of science.

00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:10.934
One of science's weaknesses
is that it's done by people,

00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:15.226
and we bring a lot of baggage
along with us when we investigate things.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.268
We are egotistical,

00:03:17.292 --> 00:03:19.809
we are stubborn, we're superstitious,

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:22.143
we're tribal, we're humans --

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:25.601
these are all human traits
and scientists are humans.

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:30.101
And so we have to be aware of that
when we're studying science

00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:32.583
and when we're trying
to develop our theses.

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:35.768
But part of this whole thing,

00:03:35.792 --> 00:03:37.434
part of this scientific process,

00:03:37.458 --> 00:03:39.559
part of the scientific method,

00:03:39.583 --> 00:03:41.542
is admitting when you're wrong.

00:03:42.458 --> 00:03:44.476
I know, I've been there.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.143
Many years ago I was working
on Hubble Space Telescope,

00:03:47.167 --> 00:03:50.976
and a scientist I worked with
came to me with some data,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.059
and he said, "I think
there may be a picture

00:03:54.083 --> 00:03:56.958
of a planet orbiting
another star in this data."

00:03:58.417 --> 00:04:02.601
We had not had any pictures taken
of planets orbiting other stars yet,

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.809
so if this were true,

00:04:04.833 --> 00:04:06.476
then this would be the first one

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.559
and we would be the ones who found it.

00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:10.351
That's a big deal.

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.101
I was very excited,

00:04:12.125 --> 00:04:14.518
so I just dug right into this data.

00:04:14.542 --> 00:04:18.458
I spent a long time trying to figure out
if this thing were a planet or not.

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:22.559
The problem is planets are faint
and stars are bright,

00:04:22.583 --> 00:04:24.684
so trying to get
the signal out of this data

00:04:24.708 --> 00:04:28.309
was like trying to hear a whisper
in a heavy metal concert --

00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:29.767
it was really hard.

00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:32.101
I tried everything I could,

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:34.768
but after a month of working on this,

00:04:34.792 --> 00:04:37.726
I came to a realization ...
couldn't do it.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.059
I had to give up.

00:04:39.083 --> 00:04:41.143
And I had to tell this other scientist,

00:04:41.167 --> 00:04:42.434
"The data's too messy.

00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:45.184
We can't say whether
this is a planet or not."

00:04:45.208 --> 00:04:47.143
And that was hard.

00:04:47.167 --> 00:04:49.976
Then later on we got
follow-up observations with Hubble,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.726
and it showed that it wasn't a planet.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.458
It was a background star
or galaxy, something like that.

00:04:56.375 --> 00:04:59.101
Well, not to get too technical,
but that sucked.

00:04:59.125 --> 00:05:00.143
(Laughter)

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:02.667
I was really unhappy about this.

00:05:03.917 --> 00:05:05.184
But that's part of it.

00:05:05.208 --> 00:05:09.184
You have to say, "Look, you know,
we can't do this with the data we have."

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:11.018
And then I had to face up to the fact

00:05:11.042 --> 00:05:13.417
that even the follow-up data
showed we were wrong.

00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:18.208
Emotionally I was pretty unhappy.

00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:21.559
But if a scientist
is doing their job correctly,

00:05:21.583 --> 00:05:24.268
being wrong is not so bad

00:05:24.292 --> 00:05:26.934
because that means
there's still more stuff out there --

00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:28.476
more things to figure out.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.351
Scientists don't love being wrong
but we love puzzles,

00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:35.333
and the universe is
the biggest puzzle of them all.

00:05:36.042 --> 00:05:37.518
Now having said that,

00:05:37.542 --> 00:05:41.101
if you have a piece and it doesn't fit
no matter how you move it,

00:05:41.125 --> 00:05:44.226
jamming it in harder isn't going to help.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.476
There's going to be a time
when you have to let go of your idea

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.226
if you want to understand
the bigger picture.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.684
The price of doing science
is admitting when you're wrong,

00:05:53.708 --> 00:05:56.643
but the payoff is the best there is:

00:05:56.667 --> 00:05:58.976
knowledge and understanding.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.809
And I can give you a thousand
examples of this in science,

00:06:01.833 --> 00:06:03.309
but there's one I really like.

00:06:03.333 --> 00:06:04.726
It has to do with astronomy,

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.393
and it was a question
that had been plaguing astronomers

00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:08.934
literally for centuries.

00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:11.018
When you look at the Sun,
it seems special.

00:06:11.042 --> 00:06:13.893
It is the brightest object in the sky,

00:06:13.917 --> 00:06:18.976
but having studied astronomy, physics,
chemistry, thermodynamics for centuries,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.143
we learned something
very important about it.

00:06:21.167 --> 00:06:22.434
It's not that special.

00:06:22.458 --> 00:06:25.393
It's a star just like
millions of other stars.

00:06:25.417 --> 00:06:27.851
But that raises an interesting question.

00:06:27.875 --> 00:06:29.768
If the Sun is a star

00:06:29.792 --> 00:06:32.018
and the Sun has planets,

00:06:32.042 --> 00:06:34.250
do these other stars have planets?

00:06:34.917 --> 00:06:38.393
Well, like I said with my own failure
in the "planet" I was looking for,

00:06:38.417 --> 00:06:40.184
finding them is super hard,

00:06:40.208 --> 00:06:43.101
but scientists tend to be
pretty clever people

00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:45.226
and they used a lot
of different techniques

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:46.643
and started observing stars.

00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:47.934
And over the decades

00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:50.893
they started finding some things
that were pretty interesting,

00:06:50.917 --> 00:06:53.911
right on the thin, hairy edge
of what they were able to detect.

00:06:53.935 --> 00:06:56.030
But time and again,
it was shown to be wrong.

00:06:56.875 --> 00:06:59.143
That all changed in 1991.

00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:01.143
A couple of astronomers --

00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:03.309
Alexander Lyne --
Andrew Lyne, pardon me --

00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:04.601
and Matthew Bailes,

00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:06.101
had a huge announcement.

00:07:06.125 --> 00:07:09.309
They had found a planet
orbiting another star.

00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:12.143
And not just any star, but a pulsar,

00:07:12.167 --> 00:07:16.351
and this is the remnant of a star
that has previously exploded.

00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:18.476
It's blasting out radiation.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.059
This is the last place in the universe
you would expect to find a planet,

00:07:23.083 --> 00:07:25.559
but they had very methodically
looked at this pulsar,

00:07:25.583 --> 00:07:30.434
and they detected the gravitational tug
of this planet as it orbited the pulsar.

00:07:30.458 --> 00:07:32.018
It looked really good.

00:07:32.042 --> 00:07:35.643
The first planet orbiting
another star had been found ...

00:07:35.667 --> 00:07:38.101
except not so much.

00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:39.143
(Laughter)

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:40.768
After they made the announcement,

00:07:40.792 --> 00:07:42.893
a bunch of other astronomers
commented on it,

00:07:42.917 --> 00:07:45.143
and so they went back
and looked at their data

00:07:45.167 --> 00:07:47.934
and realized they had made
a very embarrassing mistake.

00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:51.018
They had not accounted
for some very subtle characteristics

00:07:51.042 --> 00:07:53.226
of the Earth's motion around the Sun,

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:57.101
which affected how they measured
this planet going around the pulsar.

00:07:57.125 --> 00:08:00.351
And it turns out that when they did
account for it correctly,

00:08:00.375 --> 00:08:02.351
poof -- their planet disappeared.

00:08:02.375 --> 00:08:03.625
It wasn't real.

00:08:04.458 --> 00:08:07.309
So Andrew Lyne had a very formidable task.

00:08:07.333 --> 00:08:09.518
He had to admit this.

00:08:09.542 --> 00:08:13.601
So in 1992 at the American
Astronomical Society meeting,

00:08:13.625 --> 00:08:16.851
which is one of the largest gatherings
of astronomers on the planet,

00:08:16.875 --> 00:08:20.893
he stood up and announced
that he had made a mistake

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:23.184
and that the planet did not exist.

00:08:23.208 --> 00:08:25.643
And what happened next --

00:08:25.667 --> 00:08:26.976
oh, I love this --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.583
what happened next was wonderful.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.434
He got an ovation.

00:08:31.458 --> 00:08:34.101
The astronomers weren't angry at him;

00:08:34.125 --> 00:08:35.726
they didn't want to chastise him.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.851
They praised him
for his honesty and his integrity.

00:08:38.875 --> 00:08:40.143
I love that!

00:08:40.167 --> 00:08:41.434
Scientists are people.

00:08:41.458 --> 00:08:42.476
(Laughter)

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.809
And it gets better!

00:08:43.833 --> 00:08:44.976
(Laughter)

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.476
Lyne steps off the podium.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.643
The next guy to come up
is a man named Aleksander Wolszczan

00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:51.643
He takes the microphone and says,

00:08:51.667 --> 00:08:55.143
"Yeah, so Lyne's team
didn't find a pulsar planet,

00:08:55.167 --> 00:08:57.851
but my team found not just one

00:08:57.875 --> 00:09:00.643
but two planets
orbiting a different pulsar.

00:09:00.667 --> 00:09:02.726
We knew about the problem that Lyne had,

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:06.184
we checked for it,
and yeah, ours are real."

00:09:06.208 --> 00:09:08.309
And it turns out he was right.

00:09:08.333 --> 00:09:09.976
And in fact, a few months later,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.434
they found a third planet
orbiting this pulsar

00:09:12.458 --> 00:09:16.851
and it was the first
exoplanet system ever found --

00:09:16.875 --> 00:09:19.542
what we call alien worlds -- exoplanets.

00:09:20.375 --> 00:09:23.351
That to me is just wonderful.

00:09:23.375 --> 00:09:25.976
At that point the floodgates were opened.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.434
In 1995 a planet was found
around a star more like the Sun,

00:09:31.458 --> 00:09:34.143
and then we found another and another.

00:09:34.167 --> 00:09:38.083
This is an image of an actual planet
orbiting an actual star.

00:09:39.042 --> 00:09:40.476
We kept getting better at it.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.726
We started finding them by the bucketload.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.851
We started finding thousands of them.

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:48.351
We built observatories
specifically designed to look for them.

00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:50.184
And now we know of thousands of them.

00:09:50.208 --> 00:09:52.893
We even know of planetary systems.

00:09:52.917 --> 00:09:57.667
That is actual data, animated, showing
four planets orbiting another star.

00:09:58.375 --> 00:10:00.601
This is incredible. Think about that.

00:10:00.625 --> 00:10:02.476
For all of human history,

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:07.018
you could count all the known planets
in the universe on two hands --

00:10:07.042 --> 00:10:08.559
nine -- eight?

00:10:08.583 --> 00:10:09.893
Nine? Eight -- eight.

00:10:09.917 --> 00:10:13.143
(Laughter)

00:10:13.167 --> 00:10:14.434
Eh.

00:10:14.458 --> 00:10:15.518
(Laughter)

00:10:15.542 --> 00:10:17.893
But now we know they're everywhere.

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:19.184
Every star --

00:10:19.208 --> 00:10:22.768
for every star you see in the sky
there could be three, five, ten planets.

00:10:22.792 --> 00:10:24.458
The sky is filled with them.

00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:29.351
We think that planets
may outnumber stars in the galaxy.

00:10:29.375 --> 00:10:31.851
This is a profound statement,

00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:33.809
and it was made because of science.

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:37.518
And it wasn't made just because of science
and the observatories and the data;

00:10:37.542 --> 00:10:40.684
it was made because of the scientists
who built the observatories,

00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:41.976
who took the data,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.858
who made the mistakes and admitted them

00:10:43.882 --> 00:10:47.101
and then let other scientists
build on their mistakes

00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:49.101
so that they could do what they do

00:10:49.125 --> 00:10:52.083
and figure out where
our place is in the universe.

00:10:53.542 --> 00:10:56.559
That is how you find the truth.

00:10:56.583 --> 00:11:00.375
Science is at its best
when it dares to be human.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:02.518
Thank you.

00:11:02.542 --> 00:11:05.750
(Applause and cheers)
