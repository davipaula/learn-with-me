00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:17.101
The periodic table is instantly recognizable.

00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:19.699
It's not just in every chemistry lab worldwide,

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.499
it's found on t-shirts, coffee mugs, and shower curtains.

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.316
But the periodic table isn't just another trendy icon.

00:00:26.316 --> 00:00:29.383
It's a massive slab of human genius,

00:00:29.383 --> 00:00:34.566
up there with the Taj Mahal, the Mona Lisa, and the ice cream sandwich --

00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:40.249
and the table's creator, Dmitri Mendeleev, is a bonafide science hall-of-famer.

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:42.934
But why? What's so great about him and his table?

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:46.050
Is it because he made a comprehensive list of the known elements?

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.267
Nah, you don't earn a spot in science Valhalla just for making a list.

00:00:50.267 --> 00:00:54.518
Besides, Mendeleev was far from the first person to do that.

00:00:54.518 --> 00:00:58.583
Is it because Mendeleev arranged elements with similar properties together?

00:00:58.583 --> 00:01:01.416
Not really, that had already been done too.

00:01:01.416 --> 00:01:03.999
So what was Mendeleev's genius?

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:08.034
Let's look at one of the first versions of the periodic table from around 1870.

00:01:08.034 --> 00:01:12.317
Here we see elements designated by their two-letter symbols arranged in a table.

00:01:12.317 --> 00:01:15.483
Check out the entry of the third column, fifth row.

00:01:15.483 --> 00:01:17.316
There's a dash there.

00:01:17.316 --> 00:01:22.100
From that unassuming placeholder springs the raw brilliance of Mendeleev.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.583
That dash is science.

00:01:25.583 --> 00:01:28.600
By putting that dash there, Dmitri was making a bold statement.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.100
He said -- and I'm paraphrasing here --

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.735
Y'all haven't discovered this element yet. In the meantime, I'm going to give it a name.

00:01:35.735 --> 00:01:39.749
It's one step away from aluminum, so we'll call it eka-aluminum,

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:41.816
"eka" being Sanskrit for one.

00:01:41.816 --> 00:01:45.815
Nobody's found eka-aluminum yet, so we don't know anything about it, right?

00:01:45.815 --> 00:01:51.066
Wrong! Based on where it's located, I can tell you all about it.

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:55.716
First of all, an atom of eka-aluminum has an atomic weight of 68,

00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:58.366
about 68 times heavier than a hydrogen atom.

00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:02.966
When eka-aluminum is isolated, you'll see it's a solid metal at room temperature.

00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:04.967
It's shiny, it conducts heat really well,

00:02:04.967 --> 00:02:07.358
it can be flattened into a sheet, stretched into a wire,

00:02:07.404 --> 00:02:11.616
but its melting point is low. Like, freakishly low.

00:02:11.616 --> 00:02:15.566
Oh, and a cubic centimeter of it will weigh six grams.

00:02:15.566 --> 00:02:20.133
Mendeleev could predict all of these things simply from where the blank spot was,

00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:23.799
and his understanding of how the elements surrounding it behave.

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.533
A few years after this prediction,

00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:29.082
a French guy named Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran

00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:31.316
discovered a new element in ore samples

00:02:31.316 --> 00:02:35.100
and named it gallium after Gaul, the historical name for France.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.883
Gallium is one step away from aluminum on the periodic table.

00:02:38.883 --> 00:02:43.449
It's eka-aluminum. So were Mendeleev's predictions right?

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.915
Gallium's atomic weight is 69.72.

00:02:46.915 --> 00:02:50.750
A cubic centimeter of it weighs 5.9 grams.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.966
it's a solid metal at room temperature,

00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:56.132
but it melts at a paltry 30 degrees Celcius,

00:02:56.132 --> 00:02:58.517
85 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:58.517 --> 00:03:01.049
It melts in your mouth and in your hand.

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.966
Not only did Mendeleev completely nail gallium,

00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:06.716
he predicted other elements that were unknown at the time:

00:03:06.716 --> 00:03:09.749
scandium, germanium, rhenium.

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:13.899
The element he called eka-manganese is now called technetium.

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:21.748
Technetium is so rare it couldn't be isolated until it was synthesized in a cyclotron in 1937,

00:03:21.748 --> 00:03:26.198
almost 70 years after Dmitri predicted its existence,

00:03:26.198 --> 00:03:28.749
30 years after he died.

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:34.883
Dmitri died without a Nobel Prize in 1907, but he wound up receiving a much more exclusive honor.

00:03:34.883 --> 00:03:43.399
In 1955, scientists at UC Berkeley successfully created 17 atoms of a previously undiscovered element.

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:48.235
This element filled an empty spot in the perodic table at number 101,

00:03:48.235 --> 00:03:52.616
and was officially named Mendelevium in 1963.

00:03:52.616 --> 00:03:55.816
There have been well over 800 Nobel Prize winners,

00:03:55.816 --> 00:03:59.551
but only 15 scientists have an element named after them.

00:03:59.551 --> 00:04:02.215
So the next time you stare at a periodic table,

00:04:02.215 --> 00:04:06.782
whether it's on the wall of a university classroom or on a five-dollar coffee mug,

00:04:06.782 --> 00:04:10.549
Dmitri Mendeleev, the architect of the periodic table,

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.799
will be staring back.
