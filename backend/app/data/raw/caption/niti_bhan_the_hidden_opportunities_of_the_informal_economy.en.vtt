00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:16.832
The informal markets of Africa
are stereotypically seen

00:00:16.856 --> 00:00:18.703
as chaotic and lackadaisical.

00:00:19.234 --> 00:00:21.887
The downside of hearing
the word "informal"

00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:24.580
is this automatic grand
association we have,

00:00:24.604 --> 00:00:26.230
which is very negative,

00:00:26.254 --> 00:00:30.763
and it's had significant consequences
and economic losses,

00:00:30.787 --> 00:00:36.273
easily adding -- or subtracting --
40 to 60 percent of the profit margin

00:00:36.297 --> 00:00:39.133
for the informal markets alone.

00:00:39.157 --> 00:00:43.459
As part of a task of mapping
the informal trade ecosystem,

00:00:43.483 --> 00:00:46.016
we've done an extensive literature review

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.991
of all the reports and research
on cross-border trade in East Africa,

00:00:51.015 --> 00:00:52.826
going back 20 years.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.184
This was to prepare us for fieldwork
to understand what was the problem,

00:00:57.208 --> 00:01:01.370
what was holding back informal trade
in the informal sector.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.494
What we discovered
over the last 20 years was,

00:01:05.518 --> 00:01:09.271
nobody had distinguished
between illicit --

00:01:09.295 --> 00:01:13.740
which is like smuggling or contraband
in the informal sector --

00:01:13.764 --> 00:01:16.104
from the legal but unrecorded,

00:01:16.128 --> 00:01:19.133
such as tomatoes, oranges, fruit.

00:01:19.697 --> 00:01:22.017
This criminalization --

00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:27.239
what in Swahili refers to as "biashara,"
which is the trade or the commerce,

00:01:27.263 --> 00:01:30.697
versus "magendo," which is
the smuggling or contraband --

00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:34.242
this criminalization
of the informal sector,

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:38.135
in English, by not distinguishing
between these aspects,

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.752
easily can cost each African economy
between 60 to 80 percent addition

00:01:43.776 --> 00:01:46.544
on the annual GDP growth rate,

00:01:46.568 --> 00:01:50.302
because we are not recognizing the engine

00:01:50.326 --> 00:01:52.900
of what keeps the economies running.

00:01:52.924 --> 00:01:56.401
The informal sector is growing jobs
at four times the rate

00:01:56.425 --> 00:01:58.367
of the traditional formal economy,

00:01:58.391 --> 00:02:00.948
or "modern" economy, as many call it.

00:02:00.972 --> 00:02:04.438
It offers employment and income
generation opportunities

00:02:04.462 --> 00:02:08.159
to the most "unskilled"
in conventional disciplines.

00:02:08.183 --> 00:02:11.819
But can you make a french fry
machine out of an old car?

00:02:12.403 --> 00:02:15.864
So, this, ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:15.888 --> 00:02:19.104
is what so desperately needs
to be recognized.

00:02:19.128 --> 00:02:23.386
As long as the current assumptions
hold that this is criminal,

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.637
this is shadow,

00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:26.279
this is illegal,

00:02:26.303 --> 00:02:30.763
there will be no attempt at integrating
the informal economic ecosystem

00:02:30.787 --> 00:02:33.735
with the formal or even the global one.

00:02:34.968 --> 00:02:37.772
I'm going to tell you a story of Teresia,

00:02:37.796 --> 00:02:41.872
a trader who overturned
all our assumptions,

00:02:41.896 --> 00:02:45.246
made us question all the stereotypes
that we'd gone in on,

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.176
based on 20 years of literature review.

00:02:49.675 --> 00:02:55.164
Teresia sells clothes under a tree
in a town called Malaba,

00:02:55.188 --> 00:02:57.284
on the border of Uganda and Kenya.

00:02:57.876 --> 00:03:00.045
You think it's very simple, don't you?

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.467
We'll go hang up new clothes
from the branches,

00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:06.423
put out the tarp, settle down,
wait for customers,

00:03:06.447 --> 00:03:07.792
and there we have it.

00:03:07.816 --> 00:03:11.201
She was everything we were expecting
according to the literature,

00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:12.493
to the research,

00:03:12.517 --> 00:03:16.294
right down to she was a single
mom driven to trade,

00:03:16.318 --> 00:03:17.806
supporting her kids.

00:03:19.092 --> 00:03:21.702
So what overturned our assumptions?

00:03:21.726 --> 00:03:23.245
What surprised us?

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.991
First, Teresia paid the county
government market fees

00:03:27.015 --> 00:03:28.846
every single working day

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.123
for the privilege of setting
up shop under her tree.

00:03:32.147 --> 00:03:34.198
She's been doing it for seven years,

00:03:34.222 --> 00:03:36.144
and she's been getting receipts.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.037
She keeps records.

00:03:38.061 --> 00:03:41.228
We're seeing not a marginal,

00:03:41.252 --> 00:03:42.599
underprivileged,

00:03:42.623 --> 00:03:48.439
vulnerable African woman trader
by the side of the road -- no.

00:03:48.463 --> 00:03:52.562
We were seeing somebody
who's keeping sales records for years;

00:03:52.586 --> 00:03:58.907
somebody who had an entire ecosystem
of retail that comes in from Uganda

00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:01.246
to pick up inventory;

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.132
someone who's got handcarts
bringing the goods in,

00:04:05.156 --> 00:04:08.072
or the mobile money agent
who comes to collect cash

00:04:08.096 --> 00:04:09.524
at the end of the evening.

00:04:09.548 --> 00:04:13.956
Can you guess how much
Teresia spends, on average,

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.577
each month on inventory --

00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:19.274
stocks of new clothes
that she gets from Nairobi?

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:22.009
One thousand five hundred US dollars.

00:04:22.525 --> 00:04:27.965
That's around 20,000 US dollars
invested in trade goods and services

00:04:27.989 --> 00:04:29.544
every year.

00:04:29.568 --> 00:04:31.018
This is Teresia,

00:04:31.042 --> 00:04:32.439
the invisible one,

00:04:32.463 --> 00:04:33.743
the hidden middle.

00:04:34.442 --> 00:04:38.535
And she's only the first rung
of the small entrepreneurs,

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:42.650
the micro-businesses that can be found
in these market towns.

00:04:42.674 --> 00:04:47.558
At least in the larger Malaba border,
she's at the first rung.

00:04:48.523 --> 00:04:51.159
The people further up the value chain

00:04:51.183 --> 00:04:54.228
are easily running
three lines of business,

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:59.343
investing 2,500 to 3,000
US dollars every month.

00:04:59.772 --> 00:05:03.752
So the problem turned out
that it wasn't the criminalization;

00:05:03.776 --> 00:05:08.421
you can't really criminalize someone
you're charging receipts from.

00:05:08.957 --> 00:05:14.347
It's the lack of recognition
of their skilled occupations.

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:19.044
The bank systems and structures
have no means to recognize them

00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:20.556
as micro-businesses,

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.158
much less the fact that, you know,

00:05:23.182 --> 00:05:25.390
her tree doesn't have
a forwarding address.

00:05:25.912 --> 00:05:28.238
So she's trapped in the middle.

00:05:28.262 --> 00:05:30.693
She's falling through the cracks
of our assumptions.

00:05:30.717 --> 00:05:34.256
You know all those microloans
to help African women traders?

00:05:34.646 --> 00:05:37.476
They're going to loan her
50 dollars or 100 dollars.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.106
What's she going to do with it?

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.472
She spends 10 times
that amount every month

00:05:41.496 --> 00:05:43.098
just on inventory --

00:05:43.122 --> 00:05:45.409
we're not talking about
the additional services

00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:47.267
or the support ecosystem.

00:05:47.864 --> 00:05:51.452
These are the ones who fit
neither the policy stereotype

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:53.880
of the low-skilled and the marginalized,

00:05:53.904 --> 00:05:56.775
nor the white-collar,
salaried office worker

00:05:56.799 --> 00:05:58.660
or civil servant with a pension

00:05:58.684 --> 00:06:02.056
that the middle classes
are allegedly composed of.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.632
Instead, what we have here
are the proto-SMEs

00:06:06.656 --> 00:06:10.451
these are the fertile seeds
of businesses and enterprises

00:06:10.475 --> 00:06:12.418
that keep the engines running.

00:06:12.442 --> 00:06:14.177
They put food on your table.

00:06:14.201 --> 00:06:17.274
Even here in this hotel,
the invisible ones --

00:06:17.298 --> 00:06:20.750
the butchers, the bakers
the candlestick makers --

00:06:20.774 --> 00:06:23.167
they make the machines
that make your french fries

00:06:23.191 --> 00:06:24.417
and they make your beds.

00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:27.846
These are the invisible businesswomen
trading across borders,

00:06:29.037 --> 00:06:31.406
all on the side of the road,

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.348
and so they're invisible
to data gatherers.

00:06:34.704 --> 00:06:38.360
And they're mashed together
with the vast informal sector

00:06:38.384 --> 00:06:43.457
that doesn't bother to distinguish
between smugglers and tax evaders

00:06:43.481 --> 00:06:46.089
and those running illegal whatnot,

00:06:46.113 --> 00:06:48.144
and the ladies who trade,

00:06:48.168 --> 00:06:52.313
and who put food on the table
and send their kids to university.

00:06:52.337 --> 00:06:55.562
So that's really what I'm asking here.

00:06:55.586 --> 00:06:58.421
That's all that we need to start by doing.

00:06:58.868 --> 00:07:03.477
Can we start by recognizing
the skills, the occupations?

00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:08.125
We could transform the informal economy
by beginning with this recognition

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:12.830
and then designing the customized
doorways for them to enter

00:07:12.854 --> 00:07:15.063
or integrate with the formal,

00:07:15.087 --> 00:07:16.391
with the global,

00:07:16.415 --> 00:07:18.126
with the entire system.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.714
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

00:07:19.738 --> 00:07:23.459
(Applause)
