00:00:06.832 --> 00:00:11.992
If you were to take any everyday object, 
say a coffee cup, and break it in half,

00:00:11.992 --> 00:00:16.412
then in half again, and keep carrying on, 
where would you end up?

00:00:16.412 --> 00:00:18.143
Could you keep on going forever?

00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:21.157
Or would you find a set of 
indivisible building blocks

00:00:21.157 --> 00:00:23.679
out of which everything is made?

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:28.400
Physicists have found the latter- that 
matter is made of fundamental particles,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.683
the smallest things in the universe.

00:00:30.683 --> 00:00:35.742
Particles interact with each other according
to a theory called the “Standard Model”.

00:00:35.742 --> 00:00:39.040
The Standard Model is a remarkably 
elegant encapsulation

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.397
of the strange quantum world of
indivisible, infinitely small particles.

00:00:44.397 --> 00:00:47.593
It also covers the forces that govern
how particles move,

00:00:47.593 --> 00:00:52.216
interact, and bind together to give shape
to the world around us.

00:00:52.216 --> 00:00:53.726
So how does it work?

00:00:53.726 --> 00:00:55.941
Zooming in on the fragments of the cup,

00:00:55.941 --> 00:00:59.637
we see molecules, made of atoms
bound up together.

00:00:59.637 --> 00:01:03.965
A molecule is the smallest unit 
of any chemical compound.

00:01:03.965 --> 00:01:08.419
An atom is the smallest unit of any 
element in the periodic table.

00:01:08.419 --> 00:01:11.873
But the atom is not the 
smallest unit of matter.

00:01:11.873 --> 00:01:15.842
Experiments found that each atom 
has a tiny, dense nucleus,

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:20.114
surrounded by a cloud 
of even tinier electrons.

00:01:20.114 --> 00:01:22.267
The electron is, as far as we know,

00:01:22.267 --> 00:01:26.031
one of the fundamental, indivisible 
building blocks of the universe.

00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:30.102
It was the first Standard Model
particle ever discovered.

00:01:30.102 --> 00:01:34.235
Electrons are bound to an atom’s 
nucleus by electromagnetism.

00:01:34.235 --> 00:01:38.066
They attract each other by exchanging 
particles called photons,

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:42.130
which are quanta of light that carry 
the electromagnetic force,

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.401
one of the fundamental 
forces of the Standard Model.

00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:50.882
The nucleus has more secrets to reveal, 
as it contains protons and neutrons.

00:01:50.882 --> 00:01:55.039
Though once thought to be fundamental 
particles on their own, in 1968

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.369
physicists found that protons and neutrons
are actually made of quarks,

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.673
which are indivisible.

00:02:01.673 --> 00:02:05.732
A proton contains two “up” quarks 
and one “down” quark.

00:02:05.732 --> 00:02:09.652
A neutron contains two down 
quarks and one up.

00:02:09.652 --> 00:02:12.803
The nucleus is held together
by the strong force, 

00:02:12.803 --> 00:02:15.979
another fundamental force 
of the Standard Model.

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:18.573
Just as photons carry
the electromagnetic force,

00:02:18.573 --> 00:02:22.302
particles called gluons
carry the strong force.

00:02:22.302 --> 00:02:24.862
Electrons, together with up
and down quarks,

00:02:24.862 --> 00:02:29.754
seem to be all we need to build atoms 
and therefore describe normal matter.

00:02:29.754 --> 00:02:34.252
However, high energy experiments reveal 
that there are actually six quarks–

00:02:34.252 --> 00:02:39.693
down &amp; up, strange &amp; charm,
and bottom &amp; top

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:42.245
- and they come in a wide range of masses.

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:44.101
The same was found for electrons,

00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:48.187
which have heavier siblings
called the muon and the tau.

00:02:48.187 --> 00:02:51.459
Why are there three (and only three) 
different versions

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.469
of each of these particles?

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:55.281
This remains a mystery.

00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:59.316
These heavy particles are only produced, 
for very brief moments,

00:02:59.316 --> 00:03:03.757
in high energy collisions,
and are not seen in everyday life.

00:03:03.757 --> 00:03:07.423
This is because they decay very 
quickly into the lighter particles.

00:03:07.423 --> 00:03:11.839
Such decays involve the exchange 
of force-carrying particles,

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:16.338
called the W and Z, which
– unlike the photon – have mass.

00:03:16.338 --> 00:03:21.171
They carry the weak force, 
the final force of the Standard Model.

00:03:21.171 --> 00:03:25.928
This same force allows protons and 
neutrons to transform into each other,

00:03:25.928 --> 00:03:30.227
a vital part of the fusion interactions 
that drive the Sun.

00:03:30.227 --> 00:03:32.586
To observe the W and Z directly,

00:03:32.586 --> 00:03:36.972
we needed the high energy collisions
provided by particle accelerators.

00:03:36.972 --> 00:03:40.467
There’s another kind of Standard Model 
particle, called neutrinos.

00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:44.915
These only interact with other particles
through the weak force.

00:03:44.915 --> 00:03:50.962
Trillions of neutrinos, many generated
by the sun, fly through us every second.

00:03:50.962 --> 00:03:54.920
Measurements of weak interactions found that
there are different kinds of neutrinos

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.744
associated with the electron, 
muon, and tau.

00:03:58.744 --> 00:04:02.008
All these particles also have 
antimatter versions,

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:05.547
which have the opposite charge 
but are otherwise identical.

00:04:05.547 --> 00:04:10.150
Matter and antimatter particles are 
produced in pairs in high-energy collisions,

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.505
and they annihilate each other
when they meet.

00:04:12.505 --> 00:04:16.226
The final particle of the Standard Model
is the Higgs boson

00:04:16.226 --> 00:04:20.019
– a quantum ripple in the background 
energy field of the universe.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.584
Interacting with this field is how all the
fundamental matter particles acquire mass,

00:04:25.584 --> 00:04:27.759
according to the Standard Model.

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.788
The ATLAS Experiment on 
the Large Hadron Collider

00:04:30.788 --> 00:04:33.589
is studying the Standard Model in-depth.

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:37.913
By taking precise measurements of the particles
and forces that make up the universe, 

00:04:37.913 --> 00:04:40.911
ATLAS physicists can look for
answers to mysteries

00:04:40.911 --> 00:04:43.421
not explained by the Standard Model.

00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:46.135
For example, how does gravity fit in?

00:04:46.135 --> 00:04:50.456
What is the real relationship between 
force carriers and matter particles?

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:52.389
How can we describe “Dark Matter”,

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.649
which makes up most of the mass in the 
universe but remains unaccounted for?

00:04:56.649 --> 00:05:01.240
While the Standard Model provides a beautiful 
explanation for the world around us,

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.439
there is still a universe’s worth of 
mysteries left to explore.
