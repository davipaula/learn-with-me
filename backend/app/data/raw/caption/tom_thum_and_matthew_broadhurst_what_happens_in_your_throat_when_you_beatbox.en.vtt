00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.536
(Beatboxing) Yo, what up?

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.536
My name is Tom Thum,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.696
and I've got to say
it's a pleasure to be back at TEDx.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.056
When I first stepped
upon the Sydney stage in 2013

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.136
as a starry-eyed boy from Brisbane,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.056
I had no idea that I was about to deliver
the most watched TEDx presentation ever.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.176
(Laughter)

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.696
(Applause)

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.136
But you know, I was stoked
because it was completely unexpected.

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:46.376
However, standing before you today

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.976
as a slightly inflated, time-battered
version of myself five years later,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.216
I'm very confident.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.816
(Laughter)

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.056
Confident that I'm about deliver

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.976
the most instantly switched off
and walked-out-on,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
vomit-inducing talk of all time.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.136
I'm about to show you things

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.736
that I think you'll find hard to unsee,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.416
but all in the name of science.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.416
First, for those unfamiliar
with what I do,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.936
I guess if you distilled it
right down to its essence,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.856
you would call me a beatboxer.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.216
(Beatboxing) Yo, for example ...

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.456
here's a sample:

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.880
(Beatboxing)

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.720
(Rhythm changes)

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.416
(Hums a tune)

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.376
(Applause and cheers)

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.616
Thank you.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.416
(Applause)

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.176
And being a beatboxer,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.736
it means that professionally,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.216
I am 100 percent reliant on the --

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.496
(Beatboxing) flexibility
of the unfiltered human voice.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.456
And for years, my contemporaries and I
have been fielding questions like,

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.496
"Oh my God, that's so cool.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.536
When did you figure out
you could do that?"

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.056
After I practiced for thousands
and thousands of hours --

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.336
(Laughter)

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.376
"And what do you do for a real job?"

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.736
"I'm a full-time beatboxer, Your Honor."

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.616
But there is one question
that I get quite a lot

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.936
that's a little bit
more difficult to answer,

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.656
and that is how are you doing it --

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.456
how are you making those noises?

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.336
And I mean, I know muscle memory
dictates where I position my lips

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.576
in order to --

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.656
(Beatboxing)

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.456
but I have no idea about the inner
mechanics of everything.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.696
You know, all the flappy bits
and kind of dangly things

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.616
and how they interact in --

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.656
(Laughter)

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.096
in a way that allows me to --

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.040
(Beatboxing)

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.096
To put it metaphorically,

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.216
I know how to drive,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.216
I just don't know what's under the hood.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.336
So I decided to find out

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.576
and invite 5,000 captive strangers,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.136
a few uncomfortable cameras,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.016
everybody watching online
and their browser history

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.176
into a place where not even the most
intimate of encounters have been ...

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.576
my throat.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.456
And to help me do that,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.176
I'd like to introduce to the stage
a very specialist guest

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.016
from the Queensland Voice Center,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.216
a man that's been in my mouth
more times than I'd care to admit,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.496
a legend of the larynx,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.976
ENT doctor and laryngeal surgeon,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.496
Matthew Broadhurst.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.736
(Applause and cheers)

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.856
MB: Thank you, Tom, thank you.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.536
And a very good evening everyone.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.416
It is a pleasure to be here
on the TEDx stage tonight.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.056
(Laughter)

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.296
Whoo.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.816
(Laughter)

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.376
TT: He's not warming up his hands.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.920
It doesn't get that intimate.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.856
MB: We set out a little while ago
to try to go deep into the world --

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.096
and the throat --

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.416
of this beatboxer extraordinaire

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.936
to try to understand how such a vast
array of sounds are humanly possible.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.576
And what we found --

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.656
these are going in the mouth by the way --

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.720
and what we found
was something absolutely amazing.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.576
Even after my two years
of laryngeal surgery

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.856
in Harvard Medical School

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.896
with world-renowned professor
Steven Zeitels,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.976
we never saw anything
as extraordinary or fascinating as this,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.240
and that's what we're going
to show you tonight.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.920
(Laughter)

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.616
Alright, so for those of you
who might be a little squeamish,

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.816
the next 10 minutes or so
will get incrementally more graphic

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.296
and stomach-churning,

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.576
so let's get into it --

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.176
TT: Feel free to use the bucket.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.896
(Laughter)

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.096
MB: So when we make sound,

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.056
we use the vocal cords
to take air from the lungs

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.776
and then turn it into a vibrating
air column in the throat.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.536
If you think of it like a trumpet,

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.456
we've got the mouthpiece --
that's the vocal folds --

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.416
and then the horn section is the throat.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.776
If we took your head off,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.216
took a bit of your neck off

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.136
and left you as a torso
with just your vocal folds vibrating,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.896
this is what you'd sound like.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.296
(Flatulent sound)

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.536
TT: (High pitch)

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.736
MB: Pretty hard to communicate,
but fortunately we've got a throat.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.296
We've got all the soft tissues,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.616
and that actually gives you
all the incredible dynamics of sound

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.200
that you'll hear tonight.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.360
Now, this is a rigid laryngoscope.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.856
TT: Hmm, spicy boy.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.896
(Laughter)

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.136
MB: I know, I know.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.656
(Laughter)

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.016
10 millimeters in diameter,

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.656
it gives us the highest resolution
image of the larynx we can get.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.856
And we teed up with a stroboscope here

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.960
and a trigger microphone.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.656
The mic will pick up the frequency

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.296
and that will allow us
to show you how this all works.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.040
So, if we can have the lights down?

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.336
TT: (Low pitch)

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.760
MB: Turn the light on here.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.216
TT: (High and low pitches)

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.136
MB: So I've got the frequency of sound
matched with the stroboscope.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.656
That's the light you're seeing
flickering in the cup.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.416
TT: (Low pitch)

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.936
MB: And that's at about 80 hertz or so.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.336
So what we can do then is we can take that

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.536
and put the phase of the strobe
and the sound just out of sync.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.336
That lets us capture real-time,
slow-motion activity of vibrating tissues.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.456
When we apply that to the larynx,

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.816
we get this fluid, slow-motion
of the vibrating vocal folds.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.920
So that's what we're going
to get on and do.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.576
Alright, you ready?

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.816
TT: Yup.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.856
(Laughter)

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.136
MB: OK, so here we go.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.240
We're going to have
a look at the voice box.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.120
(Laughter)

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.096
It's very hard not to gag with this.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.696
Say, "e."

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.976
TT: (Singing) E --

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.336
MB: So down the bottom
you see the vocal cords,

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.936
the little cord-like structures.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.680
(Laughter)

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.216
And now just look at the skin on the neck

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.880
and you'll see how strong
the light is to penetrate the skin.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.640
Alright, so if you'll have
the lights back on?

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.976
(Laughter)

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.136
(Applause)

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.176
Alright, so just give us
a comfortable "e."

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.176
TT: (Singing) E.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.416
(Laughter)

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.096
TT: (Singing) E.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.136
(Audience gasps)

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.376
MB: So that's the vibrating vocal folds;

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.616
about 120 hertz.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.536
Means they've collided 120 times a second

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.320
just to make that sound.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.416
And we can also see that they're
absolutely, perfectly normal.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.456
So all his beatboxing,
all those sounds for years

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.176
with Tom's way of doing it --

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.416
absolutely no damage whatsoever.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.120
That's really remarkable.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.816
Well done.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.056
OK.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.296
TT: (High pitch)

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.536
We've got this.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.096
MB: So watch now as the vocal cords
go from high pitch to low pitch.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.440
You'll see them go from long
and skinny to short and fat.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.616
Really think "e."

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:44.240
TT: (High to low pitch) E.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.696
MB: Right.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:53.135
TT: (High to low pitch) E.

00:08:53.159 --> 00:08:56.656
MB: And what you can see
is that his vocal range is so extreme --

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.816
much more extreme than any other
performer I've worked with --

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.456
the machine actually can't capture
the really high pitches.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.096
TT: (High pitch)

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:10.256
MB: So we know that whistle register
is somewhere around 2,092 hertz.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.816
That means the vocal cords,

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.256
well over 2,000 times a second,

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.536
are banging together
just to make that sound.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.456
That's really extraordinary.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.976
If you think about them,
they're only 15 millimeters long,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.136
so that's barely the width of your thumb.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.376
That's incred --

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.176
(Laughter)

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.080
That's amazing this organ
can do such a thing.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:36.136
So now we're going to swap
over to the flexible laryngoscope.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.856
This is a little more graphic.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.336
TT: He bought it at SEXPO.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.960
(Laughter)

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.416
MB: That wasn't in the script.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.656
(Laughter)

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.880
(Applause)

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.296
TT: Secondhand.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.880
(Laughter)

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.936
MB: Now, we've had to time
this bit perfectly

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.216
because of the requirement
for local anesthetic.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.896
You've got to numb the nose,
get the camera in.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.576
It doesn't help for producing
a lot of the sounds,

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.416
but it gives us a really cool view
of what's happening.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.976
So hold onto the stomachs,
and let's see what we can do.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.440
(Audience gasps)

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.480
So we're going to the back of the nose.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.936
And there you can see the soft palate.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.096
A lot of the sounds
we make from day to day,

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.536
even the simple ones,

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.016
are incredibly complex.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.616
The sound "kh" for example.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.736
It's the soft palate sealing up
precisely against the back of the nose.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.616
So if you say it loudly five times,

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.536
feel your own soft palate
snapping against the back of the throat.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.256
Kh, kh, kh, kh, kh, kh.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.256
Alright, so this is what
it looks like when Tom does it.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.416
TT: Kh, kh, kh, kh, kh.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.856
A cacophony of cackling kookaburras
and cockatoos in Kakadu

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.776
couldn't quite quit ketamine.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.816
(Laughter)

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.656
(Applause)

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.656
MB: Alright, now in the beatboxing world,

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.040
of course, they can use that
for all sorts of different effects.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.000
I can help you.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.016
TT: This is fine, we're professionals.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.320
(Laughter)

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.480
(Beatboxing)

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.816
MB: Alright.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.456
(Applause and cheers)

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.056
Now we're going to slide down
a little further.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.456
If you'll just have the lights off

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.376
and just see if you can see
the light in the mouth somewhere.

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.880
You'll be able to see exactly
where the camera is at.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.536
(Laughter)

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.816
TT: (Singing)

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.056
Surprise.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.376
(Laughter)

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.656
MB: Alright.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.216
(Audience gasps)

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.896
So what you can see there,
that's the base of the tongue.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.736
The side walls of the screen,

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.256
that's the pharynx.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.536
All muscle walls,

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.096
and in the deep, dark decks is the larynx.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.176
TT: Oh, should we have the lights back on?

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.456
I think it's a good idea.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.416
It's getting a bit creepy with them off.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.976
MB: Turn the lights on, thanks.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.216
Good.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.096
Now having examined over 15,000
larynxes and throats in my time,

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.536
I can tell you that Tom's
is as anatomically normal

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.976
as anyone else's.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.776
It's just his unique use
of all the muscles and soft tissues

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.576
which lets him do all these amazing
sounds that you're going to hear.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.160
So we will dissect some
of these sounds for you now.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.056
TT: It's in there really. Definitely.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.176
(Laughter)

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.440
OK.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.640
(High-pitched sounds)

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.720
(High-pitched sounds)

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.856
(Hooting)

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.216
MB: So what he's doing
is he's changing the shape

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.256
and the length of the vibrating air column

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.776
using rhythmic contractions
of all the muscles

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.160
to generate all those sounds
that you're hearing.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.016
(Beatboxing)

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.190
(Laughter)

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.960
(Low pitch)

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.216
MB: And now there's
rhythmic movements of the --

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.479
they're the arytenoid
cartilages way down there,

00:13:27.503 --> 00:13:30.027
rocking back and forth
to create that different sound.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:37.056
TT: (Low pitch)

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.896
MB: And we like to call
this "sphincter bass."

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.656
(Laughter)

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.816
And what you can see
is that collapsing all the tissue down --

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.776
(Laughter)

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.296
allows a different kind
of really deep bass note.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.536
Alright, so with local
anesthetic on board,

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.536
a big black hose in the nose,

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.976
we're going to let loose
a sliver of his repertoire

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.240
and see all this in play.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.576
And we'll move --

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.200
careful.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.136
TT: Can you pull it up just a smidgeon.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.600
(Laughter)

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.536
TT: (Beatboxing)

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.136
Maybe just a little more --

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.176
(Laughter)

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.840
Alright, cool, I think we're good.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.496
(Beatboxing) To all my peeps
who came to get deep,

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.176
deep as the abyss --

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.416
check this.

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.720
(Beatboxing)

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.776
(Cheers)

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.240
(Applause)

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.376
(Beatboxing)

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.976
We start from the basics
and build from scratch.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.496
(Record scratch)

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.936
Yeah, like that.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:55.320
(Beatboxing)

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.880
(Trumpet sound)

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.360
(Beatboxing)

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.240
(Beatboxing) Back to basics.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.480
(Beatboxing)

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.840
(Beatboxing) You know the sound.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.456
(Beatboxing) Make some noise.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.896
(Applause and cheers)

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.256
(Whistling)

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.760
(Applause and cheers)

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:17.760
TT: Thank you so much.
