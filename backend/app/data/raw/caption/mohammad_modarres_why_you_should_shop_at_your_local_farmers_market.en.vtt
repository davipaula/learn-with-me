00:00:13.507 --> 00:00:16.752
It's been about a decade
since the last financial crisis,

00:00:16.776 --> 00:00:19.102
yet this industry has never been bigger.

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:23.265
Legislation that was meant
to better regulate its largest players

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.850
has hurt its smaller ones,

00:00:24.874 --> 00:00:29.945
resulting in most of the industry's assets
to be controlled by the top one percent.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.144
They've become too big to fail.

00:00:33.386 --> 00:00:35.589
I'm not referring to big banks,

00:00:35.613 --> 00:00:38.107
but the world of Big Agriculture.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.966
As a public health practitioner

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.698
who has worked with
small-scale farmers in Rwanda

00:00:43.722 --> 00:00:46.226
and now as a small food business owner

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.177
who sits at the intersection
between our consumers and producers,

00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:51.936
I've been exposed to one of the most

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.384
ecologically and economically
intensive industries in the world,

00:00:55.408 --> 00:00:56.688
and throughout my work,

00:00:56.712 --> 00:00:58.451
I've witnessed a chilling irony.

00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:04.771
Our farmers, who feed our communities,
cannot afford the very foods they grow.

00:01:06.927 --> 00:01:10.767
Today, a handful of corporations
continue to consolidate

00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:12.416
the entire food supply chain,

00:01:13.095 --> 00:01:16.894
from the intellectual property of seeds
to produce and livestock

00:01:16.918 --> 00:01:20.326
all the way to the financial institutions
who lend to these farmers.

00:01:21.268 --> 00:01:25.893
And the recent results have been
rising bankruptcies for family farms

00:01:25.917 --> 00:01:29.742
and little control for those who are just
trying to survive in the industry.

00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:35.071
Left unchecked, we will head
into another economic collapse,

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:38.440
one very similar to
the farm crisis of the 1980s,

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:40.697
when commodity market prices crashed,

00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:42.359
interest rates doubled,

00:01:42.383 --> 00:01:44.408
and many farmers lost everything.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.105
Fortunately, there's a very simple,
three-part solution

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:52.854
you can be part of right now

00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:56.536
to help us transform our food industry
from the bottom up.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.186
Step one: shop at
your local farmers markets.

00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:04.738
Buying from your local market

00:02:04.762 --> 00:02:09.322
and subscribing to a community-supported
agricultural produce box,

00:02:09.346 --> 00:02:11.251
better known as a CSA,

00:02:11.275 --> 00:02:14.249
may be the single greatest
purchasing decision you can make

00:02:14.273 --> 00:02:15.645
as a consumer today.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.512
Last year, American farmers
made the least they have

00:02:19.536 --> 00:02:21.819
in almost three decades,

00:02:21.843 --> 00:02:24.874
because they now own
fewer parts of the supply chain

00:02:24.898 --> 00:02:26.531
than ever before.

00:02:27.018 --> 00:02:30.646
Under exclusive contracts
with Big Ag and big box stores,

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.811
farmers are not offered
a fair price for their goods.

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:37.277
In fact, the average farmer in America

00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:43.622
makes less than 15 cents of every dollar
on a product that you purchase at a store.

00:02:44.877 --> 00:02:48.943
On the other hand, farmers who sell
their goods at a farmers market

00:02:48.967 --> 00:02:51.716
take home closer to
90 cents of every dollar.

00:02:52.412 --> 00:02:54.995
But beyond taking home a larger share,

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.543
farmers use markets as an opportunity

00:02:57.567 --> 00:03:00.280
to cultivate the next generation
of agriculturalists

00:03:00.304 --> 00:03:03.369
who shepherd our farmlands
and our pastures.

00:03:03.393 --> 00:03:07.415
In our fight against climate change,
we need them now more than ever

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:10.262
to promote and preserve diverse land use.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.901
When multigenerational farms
are lost to Big Ag consolidation,

00:03:14.925 --> 00:03:17.310
our communities suffer in countless ways.

00:03:17.814 --> 00:03:22.644
Rural America has now jumped above
the national average in violent crime.

00:03:23.153 --> 00:03:26.752
Three out four farmworkers surveyed
have been directly impacted

00:03:26.776 --> 00:03:28.620
by our opioid epidemic.

00:03:28.644 --> 00:03:31.526
Now oftentimes disguised as accidents,

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.649
farmer suicide is now on the rise.

00:03:35.971 --> 00:03:40.606
Step two: shop at
your local farmers markets.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.319
(Laughter)

00:03:43.454 --> 00:03:47.816
Produce from a large retail store
is harvested before it's ripe

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.699
to travel more than a thousand miles
before it ultimately sits on your shelf

00:03:51.723 --> 00:03:53.478
roughly two weeks later.

00:03:53.502 --> 00:03:55.797
Alternatively, because
most farmers markets

00:03:55.821 --> 00:03:58.622
have proximity and
production requirements,

00:03:58.646 --> 00:04:03.380
farmers travel less than 50 miles
to offer you local produce

00:04:03.404 --> 00:04:05.780
with minimal packaging waste.

00:04:06.363 --> 00:04:11.052
With the advent of online grocers
and trending meal kits,

00:04:11.076 --> 00:04:13.603
consumers are increasingly disconnected

00:04:13.627 --> 00:04:16.385
with their farmers and the economics
of food production.

00:04:16.906 --> 00:04:19.221
Since the rise of
the smartphone revolution,

00:04:19.245 --> 00:04:22.058
direct-to-consumer goods have stagnated.

00:04:24.081 --> 00:04:29.208
While local and sustainable foods
have been trending for almost a decade,

00:04:29.232 --> 00:04:31.209
terms like "healthy" and "natural"

00:04:31.233 --> 00:04:33.721
have no legal framework
in the United States.

00:04:34.371 --> 00:04:38.088
Your best bet for fresh,
nutrient-rich foods

00:04:38.112 --> 00:04:39.675
without the marketing jargon?

00:04:40.378 --> 00:04:41.733
Go to your farmers market.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.358
Buying local is not a new idea,

00:04:45.382 --> 00:04:48.667
but turning it into a habit
in today's world still is.

00:04:49.136 --> 00:04:52.334
If we want to avoid
the high costs of cheap food,

00:04:53.321 --> 00:04:54.952
protect our environment,

00:04:54.976 --> 00:04:57.300
rebuild our communities

00:04:57.324 --> 00:05:00.354
and save our farmers -- literally --

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:04.243
we're going to need to vote
with our food purchases.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.202
The success of our food systems
is directly attached to us.

00:05:09.961 --> 00:05:14.251
If we want to break up Big Ag's hold
on our food supply chain,

00:05:14.275 --> 00:05:17.546
then we're going to need
to connect with our farmers.

00:05:17.993 --> 00:05:20.457
We're going to need
to rebuild relationships

00:05:20.481 --> 00:05:23.704
with the hands that feed us
three times a day.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.448
Plus, two more for snacks.

00:05:27.465 --> 00:05:28.641
Come on.

00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:35.121
With a government online database
of more than 8,600 farmers markets

00:05:35.145 --> 00:05:36.310
across the country,

00:05:36.334 --> 00:05:38.670
you can easily find
the nearest one to you.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.436
Just think of yourself
as an investor in food,

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:47.135
where your purchasing power helps create
a more equitable society for everyone.

00:05:48.062 --> 00:05:49.229
Oh!

00:05:49.788 --> 00:05:51.225
Almost forgot step three,

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.744
which may surprise you:

00:05:55.595 --> 00:05:57.875
shop at your local farmers markets.

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:58.969
(Laughter)

00:05:58.993 --> 00:06:00.051
Thank you.

00:06:00.075 --> 00:06:04.613
(Applause)
