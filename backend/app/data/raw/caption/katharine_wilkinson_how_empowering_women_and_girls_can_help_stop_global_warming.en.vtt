00:00:12.944 --> 00:00:17.470
There are two powerful phenomena
unfolding on earth:

00:00:18.111 --> 00:00:20.289
the rise of global warming

00:00:20.313 --> 00:00:22.807
and the rise of women and girls.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.974
The link between them is often overlooked,

00:00:26.998 --> 00:00:31.821
but gender equity is a key answer
to our planetary challenge.

00:00:32.486 --> 00:00:33.800
Let me explain.

00:00:34.857 --> 00:00:36.096
For the last few years,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.691
I have been working on an effort
called "Project Drawdown."

00:00:40.323 --> 00:00:43.301
Our team has scoured humanity's wisdom

00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:49.317
for solutions to draw down
heat-trapping, climate-changing emissions

00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:51.103
in the atmosphere --

00:00:51.127 --> 00:00:55.212
not "someday, maybe,
if we're lucky" solutions,

00:00:55.236 --> 00:00:58.770
the 80 best practices and technologies

00:00:58.794 --> 00:01:00.849
already in hand:

00:01:00.873 --> 00:01:05.819
clean, renewable energy,
including solar and wind;

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:10.486
green buildings, both new and retrofitted;

00:01:11.542 --> 00:01:15.244
efficient transportation
from Brazil to China;

00:01:15.902 --> 00:01:21.482
thriving ecosystems through
protection and restoration;

00:01:21.506 --> 00:01:25.872
reducing waste and reclaiming its value;

00:01:25.896 --> 00:01:30.449
growing food in good ways
that regenerates soil;

00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:35.875
shifting diets to less meat, more plants;

00:01:36.426 --> 00:01:39.804
and equity for women and girls.

00:01:40.524 --> 00:01:44.029
Gender and climate
are inextricably linked.

00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:49.012
Drawing down emissions
depends on rising up.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.572
First, a bit of context.

00:01:53.492 --> 00:01:57.919
We are in a situation of urgency,
severity and scope

00:01:57.943 --> 00:02:00.495
never before faced by humankind.

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:06.416
So far, our response isn't
anywhere close to adequate.

00:02:07.762 --> 00:02:09.463
But you already know that.

00:02:10.155 --> 00:02:12.509
You know it in your gut,

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:14.233
in your bones.

00:02:15.117 --> 00:02:18.246
We are each part
of the planet's living systems,

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.505
knitted together with almost
7.7 billion human beings

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:27.001
and 1.8 million known species.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.795
We can feel the connections between us.

00:02:31.712 --> 00:02:33.796
We can feel the brokenness

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.992
and the closing window to heal it.

00:02:37.028 --> 00:02:39.818
This earth, our home,

00:02:40.615 --> 00:02:45.047
is telling us that a better way of being
must emerge, and fast.

00:02:47.504 --> 00:02:50.487
In my experience, to have eyes wide open

00:02:50.511 --> 00:02:52.800
is to hold a broken heart every day.

00:02:53.617 --> 00:02:55.930
It's a grief that I rarely speak,

00:02:56.758 --> 00:03:00.392
though my work calls
on the power of voice.

00:03:02.256 --> 00:03:07.589
I remind myself that the heart
can simply break, or it can break open.

00:03:08.672 --> 00:03:13.894
A broken-open heart is awake
and alive and calls for action.

00:03:14.782 --> 00:03:17.633
It is regenerative, like nature,

00:03:18.562 --> 00:03:21.520
reclaiming ruined ground, growing anew.

00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:26.091
Life moves inexorably toward more life,

00:03:26.115 --> 00:03:27.723
toward healing,

00:03:27.747 --> 00:03:29.027
toward wholeness.

00:03:29.734 --> 00:03:32.282
That's a fundamental ecological truth.

00:03:33.001 --> 00:03:35.471
And we, all of us,

00:03:36.222 --> 00:03:38.107
we are life force.

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.049
On the face of it, the primary link
between women, girls and a warming world

00:03:44.073 --> 00:03:45.829
is not life but death.

00:03:46.813 --> 00:03:51.776
Awareness is growing that climate impacts
hit women and girls hardest,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.800
given existing vulnerabilities.

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.572
There is greater risk of displacement,

00:03:57.123 --> 00:04:00.988
higher odds of being injured
or killed during a natural disaster.

00:04:01.944 --> 00:04:05.002
Prolonged drought
can precipitate early marriage

00:04:05.026 --> 00:04:07.418
as families contend with scarcity.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.472
Floods can force last-resort prostitution

00:04:11.496 --> 00:04:14.005
as women struggle to make ends meet.

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:16.504
The list goes on and goes wide.

00:04:17.262 --> 00:04:20.697
These dynamics are most acute
under conditions of poverty,

00:04:20.721 --> 00:04:23.229
from New Orleans to Nairobi.

00:04:24.907 --> 00:04:27.169
Too often, the story ends here.

00:04:27.193 --> 00:04:28.382
But not today.

00:04:29.177 --> 00:04:32.204
Another empowering truth begs to be seen.

00:04:32.228 --> 00:04:35.500
If we gain ground on gender equity,

00:04:35.524 --> 00:04:39.210
we also gain ground
on addressing global warming.

00:04:40.268 --> 00:04:43.945
This connection comes to light
in three key areas,

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:48.112
three areas where we can secure
the rights of women and girls,

00:04:48.136 --> 00:04:49.742
shore up resilience

00:04:49.766 --> 00:04:52.566
and avert emissions at the same time.

00:04:53.268 --> 00:04:56.883
Women are the primary
farmers of the world.

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.128
They produce 60 to 80 percent
of food in lower-income countries,

00:05:01.152 --> 00:05:04.282
often operating on fewer than five acres.

00:05:04.306 --> 00:05:06.882
That's what the term "smallholder" means.

00:05:07.705 --> 00:05:12.801
Compared with men, women smallholders
have less access to resources,

00:05:12.825 --> 00:05:15.023
including land rights,

00:05:15.047 --> 00:05:17.432
credit and capital, training,

00:05:17.456 --> 00:05:18.999
tools and technology.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.287
They farm as capably
and efficiently as men,

00:05:23.088 --> 00:05:26.818
but this well-documented disparity
in resources and rights

00:05:26.842 --> 00:05:30.785
means women produce less food
on the same amount of land.

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:32.950
Close those gaps,

00:05:33.702 --> 00:05:37.041
and farm yields rise by 20 to 30 percent.

00:05:37.065 --> 00:05:42.793
That means 20 to 30 percent more food
from the same garden or the same field.

00:05:43.857 --> 00:05:47.925
The implications for hunger,
for health, for household income --

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:49.173
they're obvious.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.276
Let's follow the thread to climate.

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:55.919
We humans need land to grow food.

00:05:56.836 --> 00:06:00.183
Unfortunately, forests are often
cleared to supply it,

00:06:00.207 --> 00:06:03.198
and that causes emissions
from deforestation.

00:06:03.866 --> 00:06:07.401
But if existing farms produce enough food,

00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:10.250
forests are less likely to be lost.

00:06:10.274 --> 00:06:11.998
So there's a ripple effect.

00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:14.948
Support women smallholders,

00:06:14.972 --> 00:06:17.066
realize higher yields,

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.712
avoid deforestation

00:06:18.736 --> 00:06:22.925
and sustain the life-giving
power of forests.

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:26.556
Project Drawdown estimates
that addressing inequity in agriculture

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.790
could prevent two billion tons
of emissions between now and 2050.

00:06:32.445 --> 00:06:36.708
That's on par with the impact
household recycling can have globally.

00:06:37.765 --> 00:06:40.868
Addressing this inequity
can also help women cope

00:06:40.892 --> 00:06:43.313
with the challenges of growing food

00:06:43.337 --> 00:06:45.182
as the climate changes.

00:06:46.193 --> 00:06:49.018
There is life force in cultivation.

00:06:49.947 --> 00:06:51.586
At last count,

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.639
130 million girls are still denied
their basic right to attend school.

00:06:57.234 --> 00:07:00.345
Gaps are greatest
in secondary school classrooms.

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:04.887
Too many girls are missing
a vital foundation for life.

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:09.418
Education means better health
for women and their children,

00:07:09.989 --> 00:07:11.601
better financial security,

00:07:12.172 --> 00:07:15.389
greater agency at home and in society,

00:07:16.216 --> 00:07:19.806
more capacity to navigate
a climate-changing world.

00:07:20.614 --> 00:07:25.599
Education can mean options,
adaptability, strength.

00:07:26.177 --> 00:07:28.593
It can also mean lower emissions.

00:07:29.433 --> 00:07:31.018
For a variety of reasons,

00:07:31.042 --> 00:07:33.879
when we have more years of education,

00:07:33.903 --> 00:07:36.511
we typically choose to marry later

00:07:36.535 --> 00:07:38.210
and to have fewer children.

00:07:38.234 --> 00:07:41.255
So our families end up being smaller.

00:07:41.631 --> 00:07:46.717
What happens at the individual level
adds up across the world and over time.

00:07:46.741 --> 00:07:48.946
One by one by one,

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:54.270
the right to go to school impacts
how many human beings live on this planet

00:07:54.294 --> 00:07:56.573
and impacts its living systems.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.240
That's not why girls should be educated.

00:08:00.991 --> 00:08:02.886
It's one meaningful outcome.

00:08:04.354 --> 00:08:06.946
Education is one side of a coin.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:08.699
The other is family planning:

00:08:09.505 --> 00:08:14.112
access to high-quality,
voluntary reproductive health care.

00:08:15.169 --> 00:08:17.775
To have children by choice
rather than chance

00:08:17.799 --> 00:08:20.068
is a matter of autonomy and dignity.

00:08:21.478 --> 00:08:24.215
Yet in the US,

00:08:24.239 --> 00:08:27.103
45 percent of pregnancies are unintended.

00:08:27.834 --> 00:08:31.212
Two hundred and fourteen million women
in lower-income countries

00:08:31.236 --> 00:08:34.559
say they want to decide whether
and when to become pregnant

00:08:34.583 --> 00:08:36.610
but aren't using contraception.

00:08:36.634 --> 00:08:38.472
Listening to women's needs,

00:08:38.496 --> 00:08:40.525
addressing those needs,

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:42.999
advancing equity and well-being:

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:46.426
those must be the aims
of family planning, period.

00:08:47.096 --> 00:08:49.758
Curbing the growth of our human population

00:08:49.782 --> 00:08:52.573
is a side effect, though a potent one.

00:08:53.255 --> 00:08:58.503
It could dramatically reduce demand
for food, transportation, electricity,

00:08:58.527 --> 00:09:01.411
buildings, goods and all the rest,

00:09:01.435 --> 00:09:03.481
thereby reducing emissions.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.391
Close the gaps on access
to education and family planning,

00:09:08.415 --> 00:09:13.450
and by mid-century, we may find
one billion fewer people inhabiting earth

00:09:13.474 --> 00:09:15.298
than we would if we do nothing more.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.555
According to Project Drawdown,

00:09:18.579 --> 00:09:21.345
one billion fewer people
could mean we avoid

00:09:21.369 --> 00:09:25.272
nearly 120 billion tons of emissions.

00:09:25.685 --> 00:09:27.362
At that level of impact,

00:09:27.386 --> 00:09:32.742
gender equity is a top solution
to restore a climate fit for life.

00:09:33.651 --> 00:09:35.449
At that level of impact,

00:09:35.473 --> 00:09:39.070
gender equity is on par with wind turbines

00:09:39.094 --> 00:09:41.862
and solar panels and forests.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.370
There is life force in learning

00:09:45.394 --> 00:09:47.862
and life force in choice.

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.494
Now, let me be clear:

00:09:50.518 --> 00:09:54.382
this does not mean women and girls
are responsible for fixing everything.

00:09:54.406 --> 00:09:56.022
(Laughter)

00:09:56.046 --> 00:09:57.891
Though we probably will.

00:09:57.915 --> 00:09:59.281
(Laughter)

00:09:59.305 --> 00:10:03.617
(Applause)

00:10:04.363 --> 00:10:09.487
Equity for women in agriculture,
education and family planning:

00:10:09.511 --> 00:10:13.344
these are solutions within a system
of drawdown solutions.

00:10:13.901 --> 00:10:17.470
Together, they comprise
a blueprint of possibility.

00:10:18.419 --> 00:10:20.753
And let me be even clearer about this:

00:10:21.404 --> 00:10:27.260
population cannot be seen in isolation
from production or consumption.

00:10:28.365 --> 00:10:32.378
Some segments of the human family
cause exponentially greater harm,

00:10:33.131 --> 00:10:35.974
while others suffer outsized injustice.

00:10:37.044 --> 00:10:38.469
The most affluent --

00:10:39.089 --> 00:10:40.744
we are the most accountable.

00:10:41.465 --> 00:10:43.877
We have the most to do.

00:10:46.496 --> 00:10:49.806
The gender-climate connection
extends beyond negative impacts

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.008
and beyond powerful solutions.

00:10:52.438 --> 00:10:58.056
Women are vital voices
and agents for change on this planet,

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:03.104
and yet we're too often missing
or even barred from the proverbial table.

00:11:03.883 --> 00:11:06.712
We're too often ignored
or silenced when we speak.

00:11:06.736 --> 00:11:08.454
We are too often passed over

00:11:08.931 --> 00:11:11.712
when plans are laid or investments made.

00:11:12.526 --> 00:11:14.894
According to one analysis,

00:11:14.918 --> 00:11:18.750
just 0.2 percent of philanthropic funds

00:11:18.774 --> 00:11:21.591
go specifically towards women
and the environment,

00:11:22.228 --> 00:11:25.241
merely 110 million dollars globally,

00:11:25.972 --> 00:11:31.190
the sum spent by one man
on a single Basquiat painting last year.

00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:36.685
These dynamics are not only unjust,
they are setting us up for failure.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.582
To rapidly, radically reshape society,

00:11:40.606 --> 00:11:43.121
we need every solution and every solver,

00:11:44.186 --> 00:11:45.743
every mind,

00:11:45.767 --> 00:11:47.341
every bit of heart,

00:11:47.365 --> 00:11:49.048
every set of hands.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.693
We often crave a simple call to action,

00:11:53.447 --> 00:11:56.650
but this challenge demands
more than a fact sheet

00:11:56.674 --> 00:11:58.350
and more than a checklist.

00:11:58.978 --> 00:12:02.128
We need to function
more like an ecosystem,

00:12:02.152 --> 00:12:04.543
finding strength in our diversity.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.681
You know what your superpowers are.

00:12:08.356 --> 00:12:14.420
You're an educator, farmer, healer,
creator, campaigner, wisdom-keeper.

00:12:15.456 --> 00:12:18.733
How might you link arms where you are

00:12:18.757 --> 00:12:20.509
to move solutions forward?

00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:24.460
There is one role I want to ask
that all of you play:

00:12:24.484 --> 00:12:26.151
the role of messenger.

00:12:27.341 --> 00:12:29.723
This is a time of great awakening.

00:12:30.507 --> 00:12:34.833
We need to break the silence
around the condition of our planet;

00:12:35.524 --> 00:12:40.143
move beyond manufactured debates
about climate science;

00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:41.999
share solutions;

00:12:43.038 --> 00:12:46.731
speak truth with a broken-open heart;

00:12:47.483 --> 00:12:52.795
teach that to address climate change,
we must make gender equity a reality.

00:12:52.819 --> 00:12:56.500
And in the face of
a seemingly impossible challenge,

00:12:56.524 --> 00:13:00.172
women and girls are
a fierce source of possibility.

00:13:02.307 --> 00:13:04.852
It is a magnificent thing to be alive

00:13:05.845 --> 00:13:08.746
in a moment that matters so much.

00:13:11.063 --> 00:13:12.274
This earth,

00:13:13.144 --> 00:13:14.361
our home,

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.602
is calling for us to be bold,

00:13:20.142 --> 00:13:23.215
reminding us we are all
in this together --

00:13:23.907 --> 00:13:25.320
women, men,

00:13:25.344 --> 00:13:27.435
people of all gender identities,

00:13:27.459 --> 00:13:28.681
all beings.

00:13:29.964 --> 00:13:31.700
We are life force,

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.148
one earth,

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.363
one chance.

00:13:37.182 --> 00:13:38.628
Let's seize it.

00:13:38.652 --> 00:13:40.082
Thank you.

00:13:40.106 --> 00:13:44.329
(Applause)
