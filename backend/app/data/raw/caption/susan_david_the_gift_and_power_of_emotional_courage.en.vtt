00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:14.357
Hello, everyone.

00:00:15.531 --> 00:00:16.681
Sawubona.

00:00:20.412 --> 00:00:22.618
In South Africa, where I come from,

00:00:22.642 --> 00:00:25.197
"sawubona" is the Zulu word for "hello."

00:00:26.122 --> 00:00:28.844
There's a beautiful and powerful
intention behind the word

00:00:28.868 --> 00:00:31.098
because "sawubona"
literally translated means,

00:00:31.122 --> 00:00:34.413
"I see you, and by seeing you,
I bring you into being."

00:00:35.538 --> 00:00:38.458
So beautiful, imagine
being greeted like that.

00:00:40.093 --> 00:00:43.013
But what does it take
in the way we see ourselves?

00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:45.783
Our thoughts, our emotions and our stories

00:00:45.807 --> 00:00:47.139
that help us to thrive

00:00:47.163 --> 00:00:50.113
in an increasingly complex
and fraught world?

00:00:50.958 --> 00:00:54.783
This crucial question has been
at the center of my life's work.

00:00:54.807 --> 00:00:58.117
Because how we deal
with our inner world drives everything.

00:00:58.593 --> 00:01:01.783
Every aspect of how we love, how we live,

00:01:01.807 --> 00:01:03.807
how we parent and how we lead.

00:01:04.696 --> 00:01:08.481
The conventional view
of emotions as good or bad,

00:01:08.505 --> 00:01:10.172
positive or negative,

00:01:10.196 --> 00:01:11.346
is rigid.

00:01:11.768 --> 00:01:15.051
And rigidity in the face
of complexity is toxic.

00:01:16.093 --> 00:01:19.387
We need greater levels
of emotional agility

00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:21.611
for true resilience and thriving.

00:01:23.302 --> 00:01:24.985
My journey with this calling

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.627
began not in the hallowed halls
of a university,

00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:30.919
but in the messy, tender business of life.

00:01:31.728 --> 00:01:35.363
I grew up in the white suburbs
of apartheid South Africa,

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:38.910
a country and community
committed to not seeing.

00:01:38.934 --> 00:01:40.084
To denial.

00:01:40.578 --> 00:01:45.126
It's denial that makes 50 years
of racist legislation possible

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.522
while people convince themselves
that they are doing nothing wrong.

00:01:49.461 --> 00:01:53.267
And yet, I first learned
of the destructive power of denial

00:01:53.291 --> 00:01:54.624
at a personal level,

00:01:55.117 --> 00:01:59.132
before I understood what it was doing
to the country of my birth.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.650
My father died on a Friday.

00:02:04.564 --> 00:02:06.764
He was 42 years old and I was 15.

00:02:07.802 --> 00:02:10.635
My mother whispered to me to go
and say goodbye to my father

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.210
before I went to school.

00:02:12.234 --> 00:02:15.805
So I put my backpack down
and walked the passage that ran through

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.726
to where the heart of our home
my father lay dying of cancer.

00:02:19.526 --> 00:02:22.316
His eyes were closed,
but he knew I was there.

00:02:22.997 --> 00:02:25.628
In his presence, I had always felt seen.

00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:27.783
I told him I loved him,

00:02:27.807 --> 00:02:30.407
said goodbye and headed off for my day.

00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:36.072
At school, I drifted from science
to mathematics to history to biology,

00:02:36.096 --> 00:02:38.292
as my father slipped from the world.

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.687
From May to July to September to November,

00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:43.911
I went about with my usual smile.

00:02:44.251 --> 00:02:46.184
I didn't drop a single grade.

00:02:46.673 --> 00:02:50.339
When asked how I was doing,
I would shrug and say, "OK."

00:02:51.292 --> 00:02:53.358
I was praised for being strong.

00:02:54.108 --> 00:02:56.902
I was the master of being OK.

00:02:58.673 --> 00:03:00.255
But back home, we struggled --

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:03.045
my father hadn't been able
to keep his small business going

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:04.228
during his illness.

00:03:04.252 --> 00:03:07.283
And my mother, alone,
was grieving the love of her life

00:03:07.307 --> 00:03:08.784
trying to raise three children,

00:03:08.808 --> 00:03:10.685
and the creditors were knocking.

00:03:11.355 --> 00:03:15.020
We felt, as a family, financially
and emotionally ravaged.

00:03:15.553 --> 00:03:19.525
And I began to spiral down,
isolated, fast.

00:03:20.798 --> 00:03:23.916
I started to use food to numb my pain.

00:03:24.733 --> 00:03:26.147
Binging and purging.

00:03:26.893 --> 00:03:30.093
Refusing to accept
the full weight of my grief.

00:03:31.125 --> 00:03:35.363
No one knew, and in a culture
that values relentless positivity,

00:03:35.387 --> 00:03:37.424
I thought that no one wanted to know.

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:43.606
But one person did not buy into
my story of triumph over grief.

00:03:44.751 --> 00:03:48.268
My eighth-grade English teacher
fixed me with burning blue eyes

00:03:48.292 --> 00:03:50.753
as she handed out blank notebooks.

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:54.131
She said, "Write what you're feeling.

00:03:55.106 --> 00:03:56.256
Tell the truth.

00:03:56.876 --> 00:03:58.876
Write like nobody's reading."

00:04:00.093 --> 00:04:01.307
And just like that,

00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:04.953
I was invited to show up
authentically to my grief and pain.

00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:07.720
It was a simple act

00:04:07.744 --> 00:04:10.354
but nothing short of a revolution for me.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.341
It was this revolution
that started in this blank notebook

00:04:15.365 --> 00:04:17.604
30 years ago

00:04:17.628 --> 00:04:19.500
that shaped my life's work.

00:04:20.117 --> 00:04:23.405
The secret, silent
correspondence with myself.

00:04:24.656 --> 00:04:25.832
Like a gymnast,

00:04:25.856 --> 00:04:30.387
I started to move beyond
the rigidity of denial

00:04:30.411 --> 00:04:32.515
into what I've now come to call

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.071
emotional agility.

00:04:38.187 --> 00:04:41.409
Life's beauty is inseparable
from its fragility.

00:04:43.036 --> 00:04:44.969
We are young until we are not.

00:04:45.807 --> 00:04:47.680
We walk down the streets sexy

00:04:47.704 --> 00:04:50.573
until one day we realize
that we are unseen.

00:04:53.488 --> 00:04:55.709
We nag our children and one day realize

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:57.990
that there is silence
where that child once was,

00:04:58.014 --> 00:04:59.983
now making his or her way in the world.

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:05.937
We are healthy until a diagnosis
brings us to our knees.

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:09.351
The only certainty is uncertainty,

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:12.977
and yet we are not navigating
this frailty successfully or sustainably.

00:05:14.164 --> 00:05:17.172
The World Health Organization
tells us that depression

00:05:17.196 --> 00:05:20.805
is now the single leading cause
of disability globally --

00:05:21.585 --> 00:05:23.386
outstripping cancer,

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.079
outstripping heart disease.

00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:30.505
And at a time of greater complexity,

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:34.077
unprecedented technological,
political and economic change,

00:05:34.895 --> 00:05:36.672
we are seeing how people's tendency

00:05:36.696 --> 00:05:40.807
is more and more to lock down
into rigid responses to their emotions.

00:05:42.371 --> 00:05:45.438
On the one hand we might
obsessively brood on our feelings.

00:05:46.387 --> 00:05:48.220
Getting stuck inside our heads.

00:05:48.735 --> 00:05:50.204
Hooked on being right.

00:05:51.085 --> 00:05:53.212
Or victimized by our news feed.

00:05:55.124 --> 00:05:57.148
On the other, we might
bottle our emotions,

00:05:57.172 --> 00:05:59.156
pushing them aside

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.316
and permitting only those emotions
deemed legitimate.

00:06:04.068 --> 00:06:07.238
In a survey I recently conducted
with over 70,000 people,

00:06:07.262 --> 00:06:08.996
I found that a third of us --

00:06:09.704 --> 00:06:10.854
a third --

00:06:11.466 --> 00:06:16.366
either judge ourselves for having
so-called "bad emotions,"

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.184
like sadness,

00:06:18.208 --> 00:06:20.167
anger or even grief.

00:06:22.057 --> 00:06:25.804
Or actively try to push aside
these feelings.

00:06:27.273 --> 00:06:28.923
We do this not only to ourselves,

00:06:28.947 --> 00:06:31.201
but also to people we love,
like our children --

00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:35.823
we may inadvertently shame them
out of emotions seen as negative,

00:06:35.847 --> 00:06:37.871
jump to a solution,

00:06:37.895 --> 00:06:39.375
and fail to help them

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:42.489
to see these emotions
as inherently valuable.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.442
Normal, natural emotions
are now seen as good or bad.

00:06:52.474 --> 00:06:56.662
And being positive has become
a new form of moral correctness.

00:06:59.522 --> 00:07:03.393
People with cancer are automatically told
to just stay positive.

00:07:06.434 --> 00:07:09.237
Women, to stop being so angry.

00:07:11.191 --> 00:07:12.591
And the list goes on.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.414
It's a tyranny.

00:07:16.303 --> 00:07:18.450
It's a tyranny of positivity.

00:07:20.752 --> 00:07:22.061
And it's cruel.

00:07:23.021 --> 00:07:24.171
Unkind.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.641
And ineffective.

00:07:27.728 --> 00:07:30.260
And we do it to ourselves,

00:07:30.284 --> 00:07:31.817
and we do it to others.

00:07:33.373 --> 00:07:36.070
If there's one common feature

00:07:36.094 --> 00:07:39.745
of brooding, bottling
or false positivity, it's this:

00:07:40.666 --> 00:07:43.079
they are all rigid responses.

00:07:44.586 --> 00:07:46.666
And if there's a single
lesson we can learn

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.483
from the inevitable fall of apartheid

00:07:49.507 --> 00:07:52.192
it is that rigid denial doesn't work.

00:07:53.642 --> 00:07:54.992
It's unsustainable.

00:07:55.967 --> 00:07:58.831
For individuals, for families,

00:07:58.855 --> 00:08:00.005
for societies.

00:08:00.783 --> 00:08:04.863
And as we watch the ice caps melt,

00:08:04.887 --> 00:08:07.593
it is unsustainable for our planet.

00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:11.696
Research on emotional suppression shows

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.688
that when emotions
are pushed aside or ignored,

00:08:14.712 --> 00:08:15.912
they get stronger.

00:08:16.664 --> 00:08:18.878
Psychologists call this amplification.

00:08:18.902 --> 00:08:22.154
Like that delicious chocolate cake
in the refrigerator --

00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:24.995
the more you try to ignore it ...

00:08:26.124 --> 00:08:29.728
(Laughter)

00:08:30.744 --> 00:08:32.902
the greater its hold on you.

00:08:34.619 --> 00:08:38.191
You might think you're in control
of unwanted emotions when you ignore them,

00:08:38.215 --> 00:08:40.857
but in fact they control you.

00:08:42.127 --> 00:08:44.306
Internal pain always comes out.

00:08:45.068 --> 00:08:46.218
Always.

00:08:46.863 --> 00:08:48.395
And who pays the price?

00:08:49.244 --> 00:08:50.649
We do.

00:08:50.673 --> 00:08:51.823
Our children,

00:08:52.696 --> 00:08:53.846
our colleagues,

00:08:55.354 --> 00:08:56.504
our communities.

00:09:01.354 --> 00:09:02.766
Now, don't get me wrong.

00:09:03.203 --> 00:09:04.841
I'm not anti-happiness.

00:09:06.213 --> 00:09:07.522
I like being happy.

00:09:07.546 --> 00:09:09.133
I'm a pretty happy person.

00:09:10.181 --> 00:09:15.958
But when we push aside normal emotions
to embrace false positivity,

00:09:15.982 --> 00:09:20.982
we lose our capacity to develop skills
to deal with the world as it is,

00:09:22.013 --> 00:09:23.696
not as we wish it to be.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.209
I've had hundreds of people tell me
what they don't want to feel.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.878
They say things like,

00:09:30.902 --> 00:09:34.044
"I don't want to try because
I don't want to feel disappointed."

00:09:35.022 --> 00:09:38.490
Or, "I just want this feeling to go away."

00:09:41.235 --> 00:09:43.102
"I understand," I say to them.

00:09:44.061 --> 00:09:46.261
"But you have dead people's goals."

00:09:47.187 --> 00:09:52.537
(Laughter)

00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:58.854
(Applause)

00:09:58.878 --> 00:10:00.918
Only dead people

00:10:00.942 --> 00:10:04.577
never get unwanted or inconvenienced
by their feelings.

00:10:04.601 --> 00:10:05.910
(Laughter)

00:10:05.934 --> 00:10:08.230
Only dead people never get stressed,

00:10:09.101 --> 00:10:10.701
never get broken hearts,

00:10:11.196 --> 00:10:15.140
never experience the disappointment
that comes with failure.

00:10:17.195 --> 00:10:20.695
Tough emotions are part
of our contract with life.

00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:24.274
You don't get to have a meaningful career

00:10:24.298 --> 00:10:26.093
or raise a family

00:10:26.117 --> 00:10:28.895
or leave the world a better place

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:31.037
without stress and discomfort.

00:10:32.173 --> 00:10:37.053
Discomfort is the price of admission
to a meaningful life.

00:10:39.561 --> 00:10:42.133
So, how do we begin to dismantle rigidity

00:10:42.157 --> 00:10:44.157
and embrace emotional agility?

00:10:45.791 --> 00:10:47.450
As that young schoolgirl,

00:10:47.474 --> 00:10:50.841
when I leaned into those blank pages,

00:10:50.865 --> 00:10:53.254
I started to do away with feelings

00:10:53.278 --> 00:10:56.396
of what I should be experiencing.

00:10:57.254 --> 00:11:00.600
And instead started to open my heart
to what I did feel.

00:11:01.103 --> 00:11:02.290
Pain.

00:11:02.679 --> 00:11:03.829
And grief.

00:11:04.838 --> 00:11:06.377
And loss.

00:11:06.401 --> 00:11:07.551
And regret.

00:11:09.972 --> 00:11:12.553
Research now shows

00:11:12.577 --> 00:11:15.910
that the radical acceptance
of all of our emotions --

00:11:15.934 --> 00:11:17.593
even the messy, difficult ones --

00:11:17.617 --> 00:11:20.364
is the cornerstone
to resilience, thriving,

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:23.529
and true, authentic happiness.

00:11:25.268 --> 00:11:30.205
But emotional agility is more
that just an acceptance of emotions.

00:11:30.229 --> 00:11:32.379
We also know that accuracy matters.

00:11:33.228 --> 00:11:37.751
In my own research,
I found that words are essential.

00:11:37.775 --> 00:11:40.807
We often use quick and easy labels
to describe our feelings.

00:11:40.831 --> 00:11:43.466
"I'm stressed" is the most
common one I hear.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:46.871
But there's a world of difference
between stress and disappointment

00:11:46.895 --> 00:11:50.563
or stress and that knowing dread
of "I'm in the wrong career."

00:11:51.804 --> 00:11:53.709
When we label our emotions accurately,

00:11:53.733 --> 00:11:57.142
we are more able to discern
the precise cause of our feelings.

00:11:57.692 --> 00:12:00.680
And what scientists call
the readiness potential in our brain

00:12:00.704 --> 00:12:03.906
is activated, allowing us
to take concrete steps.

00:12:04.513 --> 00:12:07.418
But not just any steps --
the right steps for us.

00:12:07.442 --> 00:12:09.442
Because our emotions are data.

00:12:10.109 --> 00:12:14.058
Our emotions contain flashing lights
to things that we care about.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.791
We tend not to feel strong emotion

00:12:17.815 --> 00:12:21.036
to stuff that doesn't mean
anything in our worlds.

00:12:22.251 --> 00:12:24.863
If you feel rage when you read the news,

00:12:24.887 --> 00:12:29.136
that rage is a signpost, perhaps,
that you value equity and fairness --

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.736
and an opportunity to take active steps

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.966
to shape your life in that direction.

00:12:35.093 --> 00:12:37.276
When we are open
to the difficult emotions,

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.736
we are able to generate responses
that are values-aligned.

00:12:41.957 --> 00:12:43.942
But there's an important caveat.

00:12:43.966 --> 00:12:46.386
Emotions are data,
they are not directives.

00:12:46.752 --> 00:12:49.894
We can show up to and mine
our emotions for their values

00:12:49.918 --> 00:12:51.846
without needing to listen to them.

00:12:52.419 --> 00:12:57.712
Just like I can show up to my son
in his frustration with his baby sister --

00:12:58.673 --> 00:13:01.239
but not endorse his idea
that he gets to give her away

00:13:01.263 --> 00:13:03.589
to the first stranger
he sees in a shopping mall.

00:13:03.613 --> 00:13:05.141
(Laughter)

00:13:05.165 --> 00:13:08.196
We own our emotions, they don't own us.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.323
When we internalize the difference
between how I feel in all my wisdom

00:13:13.347 --> 00:13:17.260
and what I do in a values-aligned action,

00:13:17.284 --> 00:13:20.475
we generate the pathway to our best selves

00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:21.906
via our emotions.

00:13:24.466 --> 00:13:27.199
So, what does this look like in practice?

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:30.292
When you feel a strong, tough emotion,

00:13:30.316 --> 00:13:32.291
don't race for the emotional exits.

00:13:33.203 --> 00:13:36.847
Learn its contours, show up
to the journal of your hearts.

00:13:37.625 --> 00:13:39.569
What is the emotion telling you?

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:45.371
And try not to say "I am,"
as in, "I'm angry" or "I'm sad."

00:13:45.395 --> 00:13:46.554
When you say "I am"

00:13:46.578 --> 00:13:49.125
it makes you sound
as if you are the emotion.

00:13:49.149 --> 00:13:51.878
Whereas you are you,
and the emotion is a data source.

00:13:52.577 --> 00:13:55.022
Instead, try to notice
the feeling for what it is:

00:13:55.046 --> 00:13:56.734
"I'm noticing that I'm feeling sad"

00:13:56.758 --> 00:13:58.780
or "I'm noticing that I'm feeling angry."

00:14:00.037 --> 00:14:02.155
These are essential skills for us,

00:14:02.179 --> 00:14:04.434
our families, our communities.

00:14:04.458 --> 00:14:06.708
They're also critical to the workplace.

00:14:08.132 --> 00:14:09.300
In my research,

00:14:09.324 --> 00:14:12.863
when I looked at what helps people
to bring the best of themselves to work,

00:14:12.887 --> 00:14:14.561
I found a powerful key contributor:

00:14:14.585 --> 00:14:16.519
individualized consideration.

00:14:17.084 --> 00:14:20.846
When people are allowed
to feel their emotional truth,

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:24.337
engagement, creativity and innovation
flourish in the organization.

00:14:25.661 --> 00:14:27.169
Diversity isn't just people,

00:14:27.193 --> 00:14:29.534
it's also what's inside people.

00:14:29.558 --> 00:14:31.625
Including diversity of emotion.

00:14:34.425 --> 00:14:38.313
The most agile, resilient
individuals, teams,

00:14:38.337 --> 00:14:40.649
organizations, families, communities

00:14:40.673 --> 00:14:43.421
are built on an openness
to the normal human emotions.

00:14:44.189 --> 00:14:46.498
It's this that allows us to say,

00:14:46.522 --> 00:14:48.600
"What is my emotion telling me?"

00:14:48.624 --> 00:14:51.681
"Which action will bring me
towards my values?"

00:14:51.705 --> 00:14:54.093
"Which will take me away from my values?"

00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:59.165
Emotional agility is the ability
to be with your emotions

00:14:59.189 --> 00:15:02.165
with curiosity, compassion,

00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:05.955
and especially the courage
to take values-connected steps.

00:15:07.891 --> 00:15:09.057
When I was little,

00:15:09.081 --> 00:15:11.891
I would wake up at night
terrified by the idea of death.

00:15:11.915 --> 00:15:14.947
My father would comfort me
with soft pats and kisses.

00:15:15.677 --> 00:15:17.211
But he would never lie.

00:15:18.738 --> 00:15:20.856
"We all die, Susie," he would say.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.625
"It's normal to be scared."

00:15:24.483 --> 00:15:28.024
He didn't try to invent
a buffer between me and reality.

00:15:29.037 --> 00:15:30.887
It took me a while to understand

00:15:30.911 --> 00:15:33.499
the power of how he guided me
through those nights.

00:15:34.228 --> 00:15:38.361
What he showed me is that courage
is not an absence of fear;

00:15:39.579 --> 00:15:42.523
courage is fear walking.

00:15:44.791 --> 00:15:47.030
Neither of us knew that in 10 short years,

00:15:47.054 --> 00:15:48.266
he would be gone.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.854
And that time for each of us
is all too precious

00:15:51.878 --> 00:15:53.078
and all too brief.

00:15:54.494 --> 00:15:57.287
But when our moment comes

00:15:57.311 --> 00:15:59.509
to face our fragility,

00:15:59.533 --> 00:16:01.232
in that ultimate time,

00:16:01.256 --> 00:16:02.517
it will ask us,

00:16:03.359 --> 00:16:04.659
"Are you agile?"

00:16:05.421 --> 00:16:06.571
"Are you agile?"

00:16:07.738 --> 00:16:11.182
Let the moment be an unreserved "yes."

00:16:12.381 --> 00:16:16.682
A "yes" born of a lifelong
correspondence with your own heart.

00:16:17.784 --> 00:16:19.500
And in seeing yourself.

00:16:20.839 --> 00:16:23.228
Because in seeing yourself,

00:16:23.252 --> 00:16:25.719
you are also able to see others, too:

00:16:27.218 --> 00:16:30.641
the only sustainable way forward

00:16:30.665 --> 00:16:33.291
in a fragile, beautiful world.

00:16:34.972 --> 00:16:36.418
Sawubona.

00:16:36.442 --> 00:16:37.609
And thank you.

00:16:37.633 --> 00:16:38.666
(Laughter)

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:39.841
Thank you.

00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:42.135
(Applause)

00:16:42.159 --> 00:16:43.420
Thank you.

00:16:43.444 --> 00:16:47.420
(Applause)
