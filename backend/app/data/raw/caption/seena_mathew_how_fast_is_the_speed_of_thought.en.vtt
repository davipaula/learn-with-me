00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:12.686
Your mortal enemy has captured you
and hooked you up to a bizarre experiment.

00:00:12.686 --> 00:00:17.254
He’s extended your nervous system 
with one very long neuron

00:00:17.254 --> 00:00:20.844
to a target about 70 meters away.

00:00:20.844 --> 00:00:24.122
At some point, 
he’s going to fire an arrow.

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:28.439
If you can then think a thought 
to the target before the arrow hits it,

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.079
he’ll let you go.

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.469
So who wins that race?

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.009
In order to answer, we have to examine
the hardware of thought: neurons.

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:43.264
The human brain has about 86 billion 
of these cells.

00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:47.571
They transmit signals down their axons 
by way of electrical impulses,

00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:49.561
or action potentials.

00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:53.411
One neuron can then pass that signal 
to the next at a synapse

00:00:53.411 --> 00:00:56.171
by way of chemical neurotransmitters.

00:00:56.171 --> 00:00:59.331
The signal is received 
by the next neuron’s dendrites,

00:00:59.331 --> 00:01:03.081
propagated down its axon,
and passed further along.

00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:07.001
So, the key factors that determine 
how quickly you think

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:10.851
include how long it takes to generate 
an initial action potential;

00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:15.274
propagate it down the length of the axon;
and transport it through the synapse.

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:18.154
We must also factor in the number 
of neurons involved

00:01:18.154 --> 00:01:21.024
and the distance the signal has to travel.

00:01:21.024 --> 00:01:25.512
Let’s see what this looks like in a simple
pathway— your knee-jerk reflex.

00:01:25.512 --> 00:01:29.372
A strike to your patellar tendon 
triggers an electrical impulse

00:01:29.372 --> 00:01:32.562
that travels up a sensory neuron 
to your spine.

00:01:32.562 --> 00:01:35.522
There the signal branches, 
and for the sake of simplicity,

00:01:35.522 --> 00:01:38.372
we’ll consider the segment that jumps
into a motor neuron

00:01:38.372 --> 00:01:40.432
to journey back down your leg.

00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:42.712
The total length of the neurons 
in that pathway

00:01:42.712 --> 00:01:46.712
is about 1 meter in someone 
who is 5 foot 5 inches,

00:01:46.712 --> 00:01:51.382
and on average it takes 
15 to 30 milliseconds from strike to kick.

00:01:51.382 --> 00:01:53.992
Speed is distance divided by time,

00:01:53.992 --> 00:01:59.920
so this signal travels somewhere 
between 120 to 240 kilometers per hour.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.570
The initial action potential accounts 
for 1 to 5 milliseconds

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.437
and synaptic transmissions only take 
.1 to .5 milliseconds,

00:02:08.437 --> 00:02:12.177
so the bulk of that time
is spent within the axons.

00:02:12.177 --> 00:02:14.217
This is consistent with research findings

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:19.923
that the average individual neuron sends
signals at around 180 kilometers per hour.

00:02:19.923 --> 00:02:24.176
But speeds can be boosted with myelination
and increased axon diameter.

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:27.356
Myelin is a fatty sheath 
that insulates an axon,

00:02:27.356 --> 00:02:30.016
preventing electrical currents
from leaking out.

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:34.985
Meanwhile, axons with larger diameters
offer less internal resistance.

00:02:34.985 --> 00:02:38.985
These compounded factors can raise
the speed of an action potential

00:02:38.985 --> 00:02:43.304
as high as 432 kilometers per hour.

00:02:43.304 --> 00:02:46.884
There’s plenty of variation: 
some people think faster than others,

00:02:46.884 --> 00:02:49.934
and your own speed of thought changes
throughout your lifetime.

00:02:49.934 --> 00:02:52.464
In particular, as you reach old age,

00:02:52.464 --> 00:02:55.444
the myelin sheath covering your axons
wears down,

00:02:55.444 --> 00:02:58.794
and other neuronal structures degrade.

00:02:58.794 --> 00:03:01.384
Back to the dastardly experiment.

00:03:01.384 --> 00:03:04.644
Arrows shot from recurve bows fly,
on average,

00:03:04.644 --> 00:03:07.644
around 240 kilometers per hour.

00:03:07.644 --> 00:03:12.568
Which means that given a sufficiently
long, myelinated or large-diameter neuron,

00:03:12.568 --> 00:03:15.428
your thoughts actually could win the race.

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:17.408
But… there’s a wrinkle.

00:03:17.408 --> 00:03:21.218
The arrow and thought don’t leave 
the gate at the same time;

00:03:21.218 --> 00:03:25.038
first the arrow fires, 
then once you perceive it,

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.958
your signal can start down its path.

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:31.686
Processing images or music, 
participating in inner speech,

00:03:31.686 --> 00:03:35.686
and recalling memories all require
complicated neural pathways

00:03:35.686 --> 00:03:39.686
that are nowhere close to the linearity
of the knee-jerk reflex.

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:43.006
The speed at which these thoughts
occur is mostly consistent,

00:03:43.006 --> 00:03:47.246
with variations based on myelination
and axon diameter.

00:03:47.246 --> 00:03:52.786
But the duration of a thought will vary
significantly depending on its routes,

00:03:52.786 --> 00:03:55.446
pitstops, and destination.

00:03:55.446 --> 00:03:58.961
In this case, when you perceive
a threatening stimulus,

00:03:58.961 --> 00:04:01.591
you’ll invoke a fear startle response.

00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:03.420
Similar to the knee-jerk response,

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.695
a startle can be involuntary 
and quite fast.

00:04:06.695 --> 00:04:08.650
If the string twangs loud enough,

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.770
you might react 
in less than 65 milliseconds.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.770
More likely though, your startle reaction
will be based on sight.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.770
Our eyes can process an image 
as quickly as 13 milliseconds,

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.770
but computation of what you’re seeing
and determining the danger it poses

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.770
can take as long 
as 180 to 200 milliseconds.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.420
In that time the arrow will have gained
a head start of about 13 meters.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.596
The target is far enough away

00:04:34.596 --> 00:04:37.696
that you’ve got just enough 
of a chance to catch up,

00:04:37.696 --> 00:04:41.766
if you can quickly, and quite literally,
think your way out.
