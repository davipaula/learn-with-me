00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:11.001
A new virus emerges 
and spreads like wildfire.

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:12.481
In order to contain it,

00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:17.777
researchers must first collect data 
about who’s been infected.

00:00:17.777 --> 00:00:20.794
Two main viral testing techniques 
are critical:

00:00:20.794 --> 00:00:22.891
one tells you if you have the virus

00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:25.501
and the other shows 
if you’ve already had it.

00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:28.891
So, how exactly do these tests work?

00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:32.631
PCR, or polymerase chain 
reaction testing,

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:35.781
targets the virus’s genetic material 
in the body

00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:40.201
and is used to diagnose someone 
who is currently infected.

00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:44.714
Yet, this genetic material may be present 
in such imperceptible amounts

00:00:44.714 --> 00:00:47.504
that actually detecting it is difficult.

00:00:47.504 --> 00:00:49.954
This is where PCR comes in:

00:00:49.954 --> 00:00:54.061
it’s widely used to amplify genetic 
information to large enough quantities

00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:56.615
that it can be readily observed.

00:00:56.615 --> 00:01:00.105
To develop a PCR test 
for a never-before-seen virus,

00:01:00.105 --> 00:01:04.105
researchers first sequence 
its genetic material, or genome,

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:08.634
and identify regions that are unique 
to that specific virus.

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:12.762
PCR then targets 
these particular segments.

00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:16.216
A PCR test begins by collecting a sample:

00:01:16.216 --> 00:01:20.825
this can be blood for hepatitis viruses, 
feces for poliovirus,

00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:24.825
and samples from the nose or throat 
for coronaviruses.

00:01:24.825 --> 00:01:27.215
The sample is taken 
to a central laboratory

00:01:27.215 --> 00:01:31.736
where PCR is performed to test 
for the presence of the virus’ genome.

00:01:31.736 --> 00:01:36.105
Genetic information can be encoded 
via DNA or RNA.

00:01:36.105 --> 00:01:42.693
HPV, for example, uses DNA, 
while SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19,

00:01:42.693 --> 00:01:45.163
uses RNA.

00:01:45.163 --> 00:01:49.457
Before running the PCR, 
the viral RNA— if present—

00:01:49.457 --> 00:01:53.665
must be reverse transcribed 
to make a strand of complementary DNA.

00:01:53.665 --> 00:01:56.775
Researchers then run the PCR.

00:01:56.775 --> 00:02:00.872
If the virus is present in the sample, 
its unique regions of genetic code

00:02:00.872 --> 00:02:05.429
will be identified by complementary 
primers and copied by enzymes.

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.859
One strand of DNA becomes 
hundreds of millions,

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:12.519
which are detected using probes marked
with fluorescent dye.

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.148
If the PCR machine senses fluorescence,

00:02:15.148 --> 00:02:17.948
the sample has tested positive 
for the virus,

00:02:17.948 --> 00:02:21.948
meaning the individual is infected.

00:02:21.948 --> 00:02:23.678
Immunoassays, on the other hand,

00:02:23.678 --> 00:02:26.678
tap into the immune system’s 
memory of the virus,

00:02:26.678 --> 00:02:29.828
showing if someone has previously 
been infected.

00:02:29.828 --> 00:02:34.458
They work by targeting virus-specific
antibodies generated by the immune system

00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:35.618
during infection.

00:02:35.618 --> 00:02:37.808
These are specialized classes of proteins

00:02:37.808 --> 00:02:42.222
that identify and fight foreign 
substances, like viruses.

00:02:42.222 --> 00:02:46.712
Immunoassays may detect IgG antibodies, 
the most abundant class,

00:02:46.712 --> 00:02:52.223
and IgM antibodies, the type that’s first 
produced in response to a new infection.

00:02:52.223 --> 00:02:55.833
The presence of IgM antibodies suggests 
a recent infection,

00:02:55.833 --> 00:02:59.543
but since it can take the body over 
a week to produce a detectable amount,

00:02:59.543 --> 00:03:03.303
they’re unreliable in diagnosing 
current infections.

00:03:03.303 --> 00:03:08.516
Meanwhile, IgG antibodies circulate 
for an extended period after infection;

00:03:08.516 --> 00:03:13.425
their presence usually indicates 
that someone was exposed and recovered.

00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:15.183
Before the immunoassay,

00:03:15.183 --> 00:03:18.083
health professionals draw blood 
from an individual.

00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:23.230
This sample then comes into contact 
with a portion of the virus of interest.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.873
If the body has, in fact, been exposed 
to the virus in the past,

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:31.236
the body’s virus-specific antibodies 
will bind to it during the test.

00:03:31.236 --> 00:03:35.912
This reaction produces a change in color, 
indicating that the sample tested positive

00:03:35.912 --> 00:03:39.668
and that the individual has been 
exposed to the virus.

00:03:39.668 --> 00:03:41.628
Immunoassays are especially important

00:03:41.628 --> 00:03:44.378
when it comes to retroactively 
diagnosing people

00:03:44.378 --> 00:03:47.288
who were infected but went untested.

00:03:47.288 --> 00:03:51.384
And there’s exciting potential for those
who have developed immunity to a virus:

00:03:51.384 --> 00:03:54.824
in some cases, their blood plasma 
could be used as treatment

00:03:54.824 --> 00:03:58.076
in people who are currently fighting it.

00:03:59.211 --> 00:04:02.008
PCR and immunoassays are always 
in the process

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:04.618
of becoming more accurate and efficient.

00:04:04.618 --> 00:04:05.678
For example,

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:10.054
innovations in PCR have led to the use
of self-contained testing devices

00:04:10.054 --> 00:04:13.064
that relay results within one hour.

00:04:13.064 --> 00:04:17.410
Digital PCR, which quantifies individual 
pieces of target DNA,

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.297
shows promise in further
boosting accuracy.

00:04:20.297 --> 00:04:23.459
And although immunoassays are difficult 
to develop quickly,

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:27.708
researchers in Singapore were able 
to create one for SARS-CoV-2

00:04:27.708 --> 00:04:31.278
even before COVID-19 was declared 
a pandemic.

00:04:31.278 --> 00:04:34.268
These tests— along with the scientists 
who develop them

00:04:34.268 --> 00:04:36.738
and the health professionals 
who administer them—

00:04:36.738 --> 00:04:39.028
are absolutely essential.

00:04:39.028 --> 00:04:43.258
And when deployed early, 
they can save millions of lives.
