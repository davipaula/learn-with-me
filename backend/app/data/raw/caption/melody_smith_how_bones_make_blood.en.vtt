00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.050
At any given moment, trillions of cells 
are traveling through your blood vessels,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.604
sometimes circling the body 
in just one minute.

00:00:14.604 --> 00:00:18.535
Each of these cells 
has its origins deep in your bones.

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:22.985
Bones might seem rock-solid, 
but they’re actually quite porous inside.

00:00:22.985 --> 00:00:26.022
Large and small blood vessels 
enter through these holes.

00:00:26.022 --> 00:00:29.575
And inside most of the large bones 
of your skeleton is a hollow core

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:32.075
filled with soft bone marrow.

00:00:32.075 --> 00:00:34.655
Marrow contains fat 
and other supportive tissue,

00:00:34.655 --> 00:00:38.245
but its most essential elements 
are blood stem cells.

00:00:38.245 --> 00:00:40.952
These stem cells are constantly dividing.

00:00:40.952 --> 00:00:43.305
They can differentiate 
into red blood cells,

00:00:43.305 --> 00:00:45.505
white blood cells, and platelets,

00:00:45.505 --> 00:00:48.145
and send about hundreds of billions 
of new blood cells

00:00:48.145 --> 00:00:50.775
into circulation every day.

00:00:50.775 --> 00:00:52.805
These new cells enter the bloodstream

00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:56.071
through holes 
in small capillaries in the marrow.

00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:57.351
Through the capillaries,

00:00:57.351 --> 00:01:01.021
they reach larger blood vessels 
and exit the bone.

00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:02.828
If there’s a problem with your blood,

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:05.871
there’s a good chance 
it can be traced back to the bone marrow.

00:01:05.871 --> 00:01:09.861
Blood cancers often begin 
with genetic mutations in the stem cells.

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:12.357
The stem cells themselves 
are not cancerous,

00:01:12.357 --> 00:01:15.941
but these mutations can interfere 
with the process of differentiation

00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:18.731
and result in malignant blood cells.

00:01:18.731 --> 00:01:22.655
So for patients with advanced 
blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma,

00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:26.904
the best chance for a cure is often 
an allogeneic bone marrow transplant,

00:01:26.904 --> 00:01:30.461
which replaces the patient’s bone marrow 
with a donor’s.

00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:32.431
Here’s how it works.

00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:35.786
First, blood stem cells 
are extracted from the donor.

00:01:35.786 --> 00:01:36.916
Most commonly,

00:01:36.916 --> 00:01:39.776
blood stem cells are filtered out 
of the donor’s bloodstream

00:01:39.776 --> 00:01:41.846
by circulating the blood 
through a machine

00:01:41.846 --> 00:01:44.606
that separates it 
into different components.

00:01:44.606 --> 00:01:47.430
In other cases, 
the marrow is extracted directly

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.706
from a bone in the hip, the iliac crest, 
with a needle.

00:01:51.706 --> 00:01:54.964
Meanwhile, the recipient 
prepares for the transplant.

00:01:54.964 --> 00:01:59.352
High doses of chemotherapy or radiation 
kill the patient’s existing marrow,

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:02.892
destroying both malignant cells 
and blood stem cells.

00:02:02.892 --> 00:02:05.118
This also weakens the immune system,

00:02:05.118 --> 00:02:09.026
making it less likely 
to attack the transplanted cells.

00:02:09.026 --> 00:02:13.505
Then the donor cells are infused into 
the patient’s body through a central line.

00:02:13.505 --> 00:02:17.087
They initially circulate 
in the recipient’s peripheral bloodstream,

00:02:17.087 --> 00:02:21.647
but molecules on the stem cells, 
called chemokines, act as homing devices

00:02:21.647 --> 00:02:24.634
and quickly traffic them 
back to the marrow.

00:02:24.634 --> 00:02:26.317
Over the course of a few weeks,

00:02:26.317 --> 00:02:30.657
they begin to multiply and start producing
new, healthy blood cells.

00:02:30.657 --> 00:02:32.962
Just a small population 
of blood stem cells

00:02:32.962 --> 00:02:36.577
can regenerate a whole body’s 
worth of healthy marrow.

00:02:36.577 --> 00:02:39.347
A bone marrow transplant 
can also lead to something

00:02:39.347 --> 00:02:42.377
called graft-versus-tumor activity,

00:02:42.377 --> 00:02:45.187
when new immune cells 
generated by the donated marrow

00:02:45.187 --> 00:02:49.670
can wipe out cancer cells the recipient’s 
original immune system couldn’t.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.320
This phenomenon can help eradicate 
stubborn blood cancers.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.306
But bone marrow transplants 
also come with risks,

00:02:56.306 --> 00:02:59.176
including graft-versus-host disease.

00:02:59.176 --> 00:03:02.336
It happens when the immune system 
generated by the donor cells

00:03:02.336 --> 00:03:04.726
attacks the patient’s organs.

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:09.176
This life-threatening condition 
occurs in about 30–50% of patients

00:03:09.176 --> 00:03:13.417
who receive donor cells 
from anyone other than an identical twin,

00:03:13.417 --> 00:03:15.652
particularly when the stem cells 
are collected

00:03:15.652 --> 00:03:17.986
from the blood 
as opposed to the bone marrow.

00:03:17.986 --> 00:03:20.806
Patients may take 
immunosuppressant medications

00:03:20.806 --> 00:03:24.006
or certain immune cells may be removed 
from the donated sample

00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:27.436
in order to reduce the risk 
of graft-versus-host disease.

00:03:27.436 --> 00:03:30.781
But even if a patient 
avoids graft-versus-host disease,

00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:33.660
their immune system 
may reject the donor cells.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.970
So it’s crucial to find the best match 
possible in the first place.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.025
Key regions of the genetic code 
determine how the immune system

00:03:41.025 --> 00:03:43.060
identifies foreign cells.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.998
If these regions are similar 
in the donor and the recipient,

00:03:45.998 --> 00:03:50.260
the recipient’s immune system 
is more likely to accept the donor cells.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.803
Because these genes are inherited, 
the best matches are often siblings.

00:03:54.803 --> 00:03:57.616
But many patients 
who need a bone marrow transplant

00:03:57.616 --> 00:04:00.473
don’t have a matched family member.

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:03.403
Those patients 
turn to donor registries of volunteers

00:04:03.403 --> 00:04:05.883
willing to offer their bone marrow.

00:04:05.883 --> 00:04:10.193
All it takes to be on the registry is 
a cheek swab to test for a genetic match.

00:04:10.193 --> 00:04:12.452
And in many cases, 
the donation itself

00:04:12.452 --> 00:04:15.423
isn’t much more complicated 
than giving blood.

00:04:15.423 --> 00:04:17.293
It’s a way to save someone’s life

00:04:17.293 --> 00:04:20.163
with a resource 
that’s completely renewable.
