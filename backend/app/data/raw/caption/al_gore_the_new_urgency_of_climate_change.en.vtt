00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.642
Chris Anderson: Al, welcome.

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:16.146
So look, just six months ago --

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:20.481
it seems a lifetime ago,
but it really was just six months ago --

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:26.535
climate seemed to be on the lips
of every thinking person on the planet.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:30.824
Recent events seem to have swept it
all away from our attention.

00:00:30.848 --> 00:00:33.150
How worried are you about that?

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.855
Al Gore: Well, first of all Chris,
thank you so much for inviting me

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:39.126
to have this conversation.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.917
People are reacting differently

00:00:42.941 --> 00:00:44.307
to the climate crisis

00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:46.948
in the midst of these
other great challenges

00:00:46.972 --> 00:00:50.268
that have taken over our awareness,

00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:51.460
appropriately.

00:00:52.175 --> 00:00:55.852
One reason is something
that you mentioned.

00:00:55.876 --> 00:00:59.465
People get the fact
that when scientists are warning us

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.677
in ever more dire terms

00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:03.827
and setting their hair
on fire, so to speak,

00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:06.812
it's best to listen
to what they're saying,

00:01:06.836 --> 00:01:11.254
and I think that lesson
has begun to sink in in a new way.

00:01:11.278 --> 00:01:13.372
Another similarity, by the way,

00:01:13.396 --> 00:01:18.478
is that the climate crisis,
like the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:01:18.502 --> 00:01:21.341
has revealed in a new way

00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:26.221
the shocking injustices
and inequalities and disparities

00:01:26.245 --> 00:01:29.644
that affect communities of color

00:01:29.668 --> 00:01:32.277
and low-income communities.

00:01:32.874 --> 00:01:34.453
There are differences.

00:01:34.477 --> 00:01:39.464
The climate crisis has effects
that are not measured in years,

00:01:39.488 --> 00:01:41.572
as the pandemic is,

00:01:41.596 --> 00:01:45.942
but consequences that are measured
in centuries and even longer.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.826
And the other difference is that
instead of depressing economic activity

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.517
to deal with the climate crisis,

00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:59.200
as nations around the world
have had to do with COVID-19,

00:01:59.224 --> 00:02:03.107
we have the opportunity to create
tens of millions of new jobs.

00:02:03.131 --> 00:02:06.199
That sounds like a political phrasing,

00:02:06.223 --> 00:02:08.680
but it's literally true.

00:02:08.704 --> 00:02:10.096
For the last five years,

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.494
the fastest-growing job in the US
has been solar installer.

00:02:13.518 --> 00:02:17.527
The second-fastest has been
wind turbine technician.

00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:23.055
And the "Oxford Review of Economics,"
just a few weeks ago,

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:28.326
pointed the way to
a very jobs-rich recovery

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.463
if we emphasize renewable energy
and sustainability technology.

00:02:32.487 --> 00:02:35.986
So I think we are crossing
a tipping point,

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.237
and you need only look
at the recovery plans

00:02:39.261 --> 00:02:42.178
that are being presented
in nations around the world

00:02:42.202 --> 00:02:46.579
to see that they're very much
focused on a green recovery.

00:02:47.078 --> 00:02:49.634
CA: I mean, one obvious impact
of the pandemic

00:02:49.658 --> 00:02:53.456
is that it's brought the world's economy
to a shuddering halt,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.482
thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

00:02:57.506 --> 00:03:00.288
I mean, how big an effect has that been,

00:03:00.312 --> 00:03:04.029
and is it unambiguously good news?

00:03:04.943 --> 00:03:07.706
AG: Well, it's a little bit
of an illusion, Chris,

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.341
and you need only look back
to the Great Recession in 2008 and '09,

00:03:14.365 --> 00:03:17.639
when there was a one percent
decline in emissions,

00:03:17.663 --> 00:03:19.624
but then in 2010,

00:03:19.648 --> 00:03:22.645
they came roaring back during the recovery

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.208
with a four percent increase.

00:03:25.232 --> 00:03:30.051
The latest estimates are that emissions
will go down by at least five percent

00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:33.152
during this induced coma,

00:03:33.176 --> 00:03:38.607
as the economist Paul Krugman
perceptively described it,

00:03:38.631 --> 00:03:42.799
but whether it goes back the way it did
after the Great Recession

00:03:42.823 --> 00:03:45.615
is in part up to us,

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:50.292
and if these green recovery plans
are actually implemented,

00:03:50.316 --> 00:03:54.205
and I know many countries
are determined to implement them,

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:57.723
then we need not repeat that pattern.

00:03:57.747 --> 00:04:00.994
After all, this whole process is occurring

00:04:01.018 --> 00:04:07.938
during a period when
the cost of renewable energy

00:04:07.962 --> 00:04:09.924
and electric vehicles, batteries

00:04:09.948 --> 00:04:13.068
and a range of other
sustainability approaches

00:04:13.092 --> 00:04:16.695
are continuing to fall in price,

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:20.167
and they're becoming
much more competitive.

00:04:20.191 --> 00:04:24.854
Just a quick reference
to how fast this is:

00:04:24.878 --> 00:04:27.903
five years ago, electricity
from solar and wind

00:04:27.927 --> 00:04:31.087
was cheaper than electricity
from fossil fuels

00:04:31.111 --> 00:04:32.891
in only one percent of the world.

00:04:32.915 --> 00:04:36.048
This year, it's cheaper
in two-thirds of the world,

00:04:36.072 --> 00:04:38.093
and five years from now,

00:04:38.117 --> 00:04:42.667
it will be cheaper in virtually
100 percent of the world.

00:04:42.691 --> 00:04:46.821
EVs will be cost-competitive
within two years,

00:04:46.845 --> 00:04:50.266
and then will continue falling in price.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.154
And so there are changes underway

00:04:53.178 --> 00:04:57.472
that could interrupt the pattern
we saw after the Great Recession.

00:04:58.193 --> 00:05:02.050
CA: The reason those pricing differentials
happen in different parts of the world

00:05:02.074 --> 00:05:05.851
is obviously because there's different
amounts of sunshine and wind there

00:05:05.875 --> 00:05:08.051
and different building costs and so forth.

00:05:08.624 --> 00:05:13.150
AG: Well, yes, and government policies
also account for a lot.

00:05:13.174 --> 00:05:16.633
The world is continuing
to subsidize fossil fuels

00:05:16.657 --> 00:05:18.578
at a ridiculous amount,

00:05:18.602 --> 00:05:23.653
more so in many developing countries
than in the US and developed countries,

00:05:23.677 --> 00:05:27.972
but it's subsidized here as well.

00:05:27.996 --> 00:05:30.288
But everywhere in the world,

00:05:30.312 --> 00:05:34.702
wind and solar will be cheaper
as a source of electricity

00:05:34.726 --> 00:05:36.277
than fossil fuels,

00:05:36.301 --> 00:05:37.814
within a few years.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.872
CA: I think I've heard it said
that the fall in emissions

00:05:41.896 --> 00:05:44.019
caused by the pandemic

00:05:44.043 --> 00:05:47.291
isn't that much more than, actually,
the fall that we will need

00:05:47.315 --> 00:05:49.132
every single year

00:05:49.156 --> 00:05:52.406
if we're to meet emissions targets.

00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:54.840
Is that true, and, if so,

00:05:54.864 --> 00:05:57.080
doesn't that seem impossibly daunting?

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.445
AG: It does seem daunting,
but first look at the number.

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:03.769
That number came from a study
a little over a year ago

00:06:03.793 --> 00:06:06.483
released by the IPCC

00:06:06.507 --> 00:06:11.755
as to what it would take to keep
the Earth's temperatures from increasing

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:14.941
more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.

00:06:14.965 --> 00:06:20.001
And yes, the annual reductions
would be significant,

00:06:20.025 --> 00:06:22.912
on the order of what we've seen
with the pandemic.

00:06:22.936 --> 00:06:24.698
And yes, that does seem daunting.

00:06:24.722 --> 00:06:31.707
However, we do have the opportunity
to make some fairly dramatic changes,

00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:34.331
and the plan is not a mystery.

00:06:34.355 --> 00:06:39.806
You start with the two sectors that are
closest to an effective transition --

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.688
electricity generation, as I mentioned --

00:06:42.712 --> 00:06:45.304
and last year, 2019,

00:06:45.328 --> 00:06:49.270
if you look at all of the new
electricity generation built

00:06:49.294 --> 00:06:50.770
all around the world,

00:06:50.794 --> 00:06:55.141
72 percent of it was from solar and wind.

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:59.986
And already, without the continuing
subsidies for fossil fuels,

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.510
we would see many more of these plants

00:07:02.534 --> 00:07:03.908
being shut down.

00:07:03.932 --> 00:07:06.051
There are some new
fossil plants being built,

00:07:06.075 --> 00:07:09.004
but many more are being shut down.

00:07:09.028 --> 00:07:11.139
And where transportation is concerned,

00:07:11.163 --> 00:07:13.850
the second sector ready to go,

00:07:13.874 --> 00:07:19.515
in addition to the cheaper prices
for EVs that I made reference to before,

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:24.078
there are some 45 jurisdictions
around the world --

00:07:24.102 --> 00:07:28.886
national, regional and municipal --

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.313
where laws have been passed
beginning a phaseout

00:07:32.337 --> 00:07:33.880
of internal combustion engines.

00:07:33.904 --> 00:07:38.243
Even India said that by 2030,
less than 10 years from now,

00:07:38.267 --> 00:07:43.039
it will be illegal to sell
any new internal combustion engines

00:07:43.063 --> 00:07:44.364
in India.

00:07:44.388 --> 00:07:46.661
There are many other examples.

00:07:46.685 --> 00:07:51.051
So the past small reductions

00:07:51.075 --> 00:07:55.023
may not be an accurate guide
to the kind we can achieve

00:07:55.047 --> 00:07:58.100
with serious national plans

00:07:58.124 --> 00:08:00.592
and a focused global effort.

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:05.077
CA: So help us understand
just the big picture here, Al.

00:08:05.101 --> 00:08:08.324
I think before the pandemic,

00:08:08.348 --> 00:08:10.927
the world was emitting

00:08:10.951 --> 00:08:15.154
about 55 gigatons of what
they call "CO2 equivalent,"

00:08:15.178 --> 00:08:17.062
so that includes other greenhouse gases

00:08:17.086 --> 00:08:21.193
like methane dialed up
to be the equivalent of CO2.

00:08:21.217 --> 00:08:23.859
And am I right in saying that the IPCC,

00:08:23.883 --> 00:08:27.044
which is the global
organization of scientists,

00:08:27.068 --> 00:08:31.991
is recommending that
the only way to fix this crisis

00:08:32.015 --> 00:08:34.726
is to get that number from 55 to zero

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.845
by 2050 at the very latest,

00:08:37.869 --> 00:08:42.237
and that even then, there's a chance
that we will end up with temperature rises

00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:46.678
more like two degrees Celsius
rather than 1.5?

00:08:46.702 --> 00:08:49.775
I mean, is that approximately
the big picture

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:52.077
of what the IPCC is recommending?

00:08:52.803 --> 00:08:54.083
AG: That's correct.

00:08:54.107 --> 00:08:58.872
The global goal established
in the Paris Conference

00:08:58.896 --> 00:09:01.821
is to get to net zero on a global basis

00:09:01.845 --> 00:09:03.359
by 2050,

00:09:03.383 --> 00:09:05.104
and many people quickly add

00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:10.456
that that really means a 45
to 50 percent reduction by 2030

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:15.101
to make that pathway
to net zero feasible.

00:09:15.902 --> 00:09:18.398
CA: And that kind of timeline
is the kind of timeline

00:09:18.422 --> 00:09:20.296
where people couldn't even imagine it.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.568
It's just hard to think
of policy over 30 years.

00:09:22.592 --> 00:09:24.570
So that's actually a very good shorthand,

00:09:24.594 --> 00:09:28.954
that humanity's task is to cut
emissions in half by 2030,

00:09:28.978 --> 00:09:31.410
approximately speaking,

00:09:31.434 --> 00:09:36.921
which I think boils down to about
a seven or eight percent reduction a year,

00:09:36.945 --> 00:09:38.816
something like that, if I'm not wrong.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.750
AG: Not quite. Not quite that large

00:09:40.774 --> 00:09:42.768
but close, yes.

00:09:43.806 --> 00:09:48.926
CA: So it is something like the effect
that we've experienced this year

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.166
may be necessary.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.247
This year, we've done it
by basically shutting down the economy.

00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:57.321
You're talking about a way of doing it
over the coming years

00:09:57.345 --> 00:10:01.217
that actually gives some
economic growth and new jobs.

00:10:01.241 --> 00:10:02.948
So talk more about that.

00:10:02.972 --> 00:10:06.131
You've referred to
changing our energy sources,

00:10:06.155 --> 00:10:07.969
changing how we transport.

00:10:07.993 --> 00:10:09.680
If we did those things,

00:10:09.704 --> 00:10:12.467
how much of the problem does that solve?

00:10:13.284 --> 00:10:14.787
AG: Well, we can get to --

00:10:14.811 --> 00:10:17.826
well, in addition to doing
the two sectors that I mentioned,

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:22.883
we also have to deal with manufacturing
and all the use cases

00:10:22.907 --> 00:10:26.601
that require temperatures
of a thousand degrees Celsius,

00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:28.908
and there are solutions there as well.

00:10:28.932 --> 00:10:34.562
I'll come back and mention an exciting one
that Germany has just embarked upon.

00:10:34.586 --> 00:10:38.482
We also have to tackle
regenerative agriculture.

00:10:38.506 --> 00:10:44.091
There is the opportunity
to sequester a great deal of carbon

00:10:44.115 --> 00:10:46.497
in topsoils around the world

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:49.875
by changing the agricultural techniques.

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:53.074
There is a farmer-led movement to do that.

00:10:53.098 --> 00:10:56.956
We need to also retrofit buildings.

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:02.359
We need to change our management
of forests and the ocean.

00:11:02.383 --> 00:11:05.688
But let me just mention
two things briefly.

00:11:05.712 --> 00:11:08.995
First of all, the high
temperature use cases.

00:11:09.423 --> 00:11:12.726
Angela Merkel, just 10 days ago,

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.288
with the leadership of
her minister Peter Altmaier,

00:11:16.312 --> 00:11:19.188
who is a good friend
and a great public servant,

00:11:19.212 --> 00:11:23.560
have just embarked on
a green hydrogen strategy

00:11:23.584 --> 00:11:26.180
to make hydrogen

00:11:26.204 --> 00:11:29.761
with zero marginal cost renewable energy.

00:11:29.785 --> 00:11:32.339
And just a word on that, Chris:

00:11:32.363 --> 00:11:37.045
you've heard about the intermittency
of wind and solar --

00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:40.223
solar doesn't produce electricity
when the sun's not shining,

00:11:40.247 --> 00:11:43.251
and wind doesn't
when the wind's not blowing --

00:11:43.275 --> 00:11:45.618
but batteries are getting better,

00:11:45.642 --> 00:11:49.711
and these technologies are becoming
much more efficient and powerful,

00:11:49.735 --> 00:11:53.598
so that for an increasing number
of hours of each day,

00:11:53.622 --> 00:11:58.825
they're producing often way more
electricity than can be used.

00:11:58.849 --> 00:12:00.298
So what to do with it?

00:12:00.322 --> 00:12:04.641
The marginal cost
for the next kilowatt-hour is zero.

00:12:04.665 --> 00:12:05.826
So all of a sudden,

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:11.007
the very energy-intensive process
of cracking hydrogen from water

00:12:11.031 --> 00:12:13.490
becomes economically feasible,

00:12:13.514 --> 00:12:19.309
and it can be substituted
for coal and gas,

00:12:19.333 --> 00:12:20.876
and that's already being done.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:25.454
There's a Swedish company
already making steel with green hydrogen,

00:12:25.478 --> 00:12:30.329
and, as I say, Germany has just embarked
on a major new initiative to do that.

00:12:30.353 --> 00:12:33.695
I think they're pointing the way
for the rest of the world.

00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:37.001
Now, where building retrofits
are concerned, just a moment on this,

00:12:37.025 --> 00:12:41.637
because about 20 to 25 percent
of the global warming pollution

00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:44.152
in the world and in the US

00:12:44.176 --> 00:12:47.254
comes from inefficient buildings

00:12:47.278 --> 00:12:51.715
that were constructed
by companies and individuals

00:12:51.739 --> 00:12:54.212
who were trying to be competitive
in the marketplace

00:12:54.236 --> 00:12:56.933
and keep their margins acceptably high

00:12:56.957 --> 00:13:00.596
and thereby skimping on insulation
and the right windows

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.728
and LEDs and the rest.

00:13:02.752 --> 00:13:06.537
And yet the person or company
that buys that building

00:13:06.561 --> 00:13:08.014
or leases that building,

00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:10.946
they want their monthly
utility bills much lower.

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:12.833
So there are now ways

00:13:12.857 --> 00:13:15.931
to close that so-called
agent-principal divide,

00:13:15.955 --> 00:13:19.901
the differing incentives
for the builder and occupier,

00:13:19.925 --> 00:13:24.850
and we can retrofit buildings with
a program that literally pays for itself

00:13:24.874 --> 00:13:26.728
over three to five years,

00:13:26.752 --> 00:13:29.993
and we could put tens of millions
of people to work

00:13:30.017 --> 00:13:33.180
in jobs that by definition
cannot be outsourced

00:13:33.204 --> 00:13:36.753
because they exist
in every single community.

00:13:36.777 --> 00:13:39.771
And we really ought to get serious
about doing this,

00:13:39.795 --> 00:13:42.690
because we're going to need all those jobs

00:13:42.714 --> 00:13:47.498
to get sustainable prosperity
in the aftermath of this pandemic.

00:13:49.192 --> 00:13:51.202
CA: Just going back
to the hydrogen economy

00:13:51.226 --> 00:13:52.905
that you referred to there,

00:13:52.929 --> 00:13:54.227
when some people hear that,

00:13:54.251 --> 00:13:57.497
they think, "Oh, are you talking
about hydrogen-fueled cars?"

00:13:57.521 --> 00:14:00.648
And they've heard that that
probably won't be a winning strategy.

00:14:00.672 --> 00:14:03.374
But you're thinking much more
broadly than that, I think,

00:14:03.398 --> 00:14:07.835
that it's not just hydrogen
as a kind of storage mechanism

00:14:07.859 --> 00:14:11.029
to act as a buffer for renewable energy,

00:14:11.053 --> 00:14:12.777
but also hydrogen could be essential

00:14:12.801 --> 00:14:17.715
for some of the other processes
in the economy like making steel,

00:14:17.739 --> 00:14:18.912
making cement,

00:14:18.936 --> 00:14:23.458
that are fundamentally
carbon-intensive processes right now

00:14:23.482 --> 00:14:26.860
but could be transformed if we had
much cheaper sources of hydrogen.

00:14:26.884 --> 00:14:28.050
Is that right?

00:14:28.377 --> 00:14:32.652
AG: Yes, I was always skeptical
about hydrogen, Chris,

00:14:32.676 --> 00:14:37.099
principally because it's been
so expensive to make it,

00:14:37.123 --> 00:14:39.948
to "crack it out of water," as they say.

00:14:39.972 --> 00:14:42.455
But the game-changer has been

00:14:42.479 --> 00:14:48.010
the incredible abundance
of solar and wind electricity

00:14:48.034 --> 00:14:52.255
in volumes and amounts
that people didn't expect,

00:14:52.279 --> 00:14:55.027
and all of a sudden,
it's cheap enough to use

00:14:55.051 --> 00:14:58.204
for these very energy-intensive processes

00:14:58.228 --> 00:15:00.464
like creating green hydrogen.

00:15:00.488 --> 00:15:03.853
I'm still a bit skeptical
about using it in vehicles.

00:15:03.877 --> 00:15:10.298
Toyota's been betting on that for 25 years
and it hasn't really worked for them.

00:15:10.322 --> 00:15:12.066
Never say never, maybe it will,

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:17.186
but I think it's most useful for these
high-temperature industrial processes,

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:22.532
and we already have a pathway
for decarbonizing transportation

00:15:22.556 --> 00:15:23.985
with electricity

00:15:24.009 --> 00:15:26.292
that's working extremely well.

00:15:26.316 --> 00:15:31.591
Tesla's going to be soon the most valuable
automobile company in the world,

00:15:31.615 --> 00:15:32.905
already in the US,

00:15:32.929 --> 00:15:35.691
and they're about to overtake Toyota.

00:15:35.715 --> 00:15:42.558
There is now a semitruck company
that's been stood up by Tesla

00:15:42.582 --> 00:15:48.126
and another that is going to be a hybrid
with electricity and green hydrogen,

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:51.834
so we'll see whether or not
they can make it work in that application.

00:15:51.858 --> 00:15:55.539
But I think electricity is preferable
for cars and trucks.

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:59.220
CA: We're coming to some
community questions in a minute.

00:15:59.244 --> 00:16:01.540
Let me ask you, though, about nuclear.

00:16:01.564 --> 00:16:05.080
Some environmentalists
believe that nuclear,

00:16:05.104 --> 00:16:07.885
or maybe new generation nuclear power

00:16:07.909 --> 00:16:10.936
is an essential part of the equation

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.475
if we're to get to a truly clean future,

00:16:14.499 --> 00:16:15.794
a clean energy future.

00:16:15.818 --> 00:16:19.625
Are you still pretty skeptical
on nuclear, Al?

00:16:20.441 --> 00:16:23.727
AG: Well, the market's skeptical
about it, Chris.

00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:28.540
It's been a crushing disappointment
for me and for so many.

00:16:28.564 --> 00:16:32.150
I used to represent Oak Ridge,
where nuclear energy began,

00:16:32.174 --> 00:16:34.405
and when I was a young congressman,

00:16:34.429 --> 00:16:35.761
I was a booster.

00:16:35.785 --> 00:16:38.007
I was very enthusiastic about it.

00:16:38.031 --> 00:16:40.074
But the cost overruns

00:16:40.098 --> 00:16:44.096
and the problems in building these plants

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.525
have become so severe

00:16:46.549 --> 00:16:50.549
that utilities just don't have
an appetite for them.

00:16:50.573 --> 00:16:55.358
It's become the most expensive
source of electricity.

00:16:55.382 --> 00:17:01.051
Now, let me hasten to add
that there are some older nuclear reactors

00:17:01.075 --> 00:17:07.146
that have more useful time
that could be added onto their lifetimes.

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:08.972
And like a lot of environmentalists,

00:17:08.996 --> 00:17:14.534
I've come to the view
that if they can be determined to be safe,

00:17:14.558 --> 00:17:21.296
they should be allowed to continue
operating for a time.

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.809
But where new nuclear
power plants are concerned,

00:17:23.833 --> 00:17:25.534
here's a way to look at it.

00:17:25.558 --> 00:17:28.036
If you are -- you've been a CEO, Chris.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:32.341
If you were the CEO of --
I guess you still are.

00:17:32.365 --> 00:17:35.514
If you were the CEO
of an electric utility,

00:17:35.538 --> 00:17:37.387
and you told your executive team,

00:17:37.411 --> 00:17:40.341
"I want to build a nuclear power plant,"

00:17:40.365 --> 00:17:43.987
two of the first questions
you would ask are, number one:

00:17:44.011 --> 00:17:45.985
How much will it cost?

00:17:46.009 --> 00:17:49.253
And there's not a single
engineering consulting firm

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:51.577
that I've been able to find
anywhere in the world

00:17:51.601 --> 00:17:55.019
that will put their name on an opinion

00:17:55.043 --> 00:17:57.002
giving you a cost estimate.

00:17:57.026 --> 00:17:58.642
They just don't know.

00:17:58.666 --> 00:18:00.688
A second question you would ask is:

00:18:00.712 --> 00:18:05.350
How long will it take to build it,
so we can start selling the electricity?

00:18:05.374 --> 00:18:07.323
And again, the answer you will get is,

00:18:07.347 --> 00:18:08.826
"We have no idea."

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.480
So if you don't know
how much it's going to cost,

00:18:11.504 --> 00:18:14.204
and you don't know
when it's going to be finished,

00:18:14.228 --> 00:18:17.521
and you already know that
the electricity is more expensive

00:18:17.545 --> 00:18:20.782
than the alternate ways to produce it,

00:18:20.806 --> 00:18:22.816
that's going to be a little discouraging,

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.361
and, in fact, that's been the case
for utilities around the world.

00:18:27.715 --> 00:18:28.885
CA: OK.

00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:31.510
So there's definitely
an interesting debate there,

00:18:31.534 --> 00:18:34.349
but we're going to come on
to some community questions.

00:18:34.373 --> 00:18:36.909
Let's have the first
of those questions up, please.

00:18:38.306 --> 00:18:40.785
From Prosanta Chakrabarty:

00:18:40.809 --> 00:18:43.437
"People who are skeptical
of COVID and of climate change

00:18:43.461 --> 00:18:45.505
seem to be skeptical
of science in general.

00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:47.932
It may be that the singular
message from scientists

00:18:47.956 --> 00:18:49.339
gets diluted and convoluted.

00:18:49.363 --> 00:18:51.026
How do we fix that?"

00:18:51.757 --> 00:18:55.879
AG: Yeah, that's
a great question, Prosanta.

00:18:56.609 --> 00:19:01.815
Boy, I'm trying to put this
succinctly and shortly.

00:19:01.839 --> 00:19:04.276
I think that there has been

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:09.163
a feeling that experts in general

00:19:09.187 --> 00:19:12.736
have kind of let the US down,

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:19.750
and that feeling is much more pronounced
in the US than in most other countries.

00:19:19.774 --> 00:19:26.726
And I think that the considered opinion
of what we call experts

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:30.747
has been diluted over the last few decades

00:19:30.771 --> 00:19:36.790
by the unhealthy dominance
of big money in our political system,

00:19:36.814 --> 00:19:43.371
which has found ways
to really twist economic policy

00:19:43.395 --> 00:19:45.604
to benefit elites.

00:19:45.628 --> 00:19:47.268
And this sounds a little radical,

00:19:47.292 --> 00:19:50.356
but it's actually what has happened.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:54.266
And we have gone for more than 40 years

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:57.671
without any meaningful increase
in middle-income pay,

00:19:57.695 --> 00:20:02.871
and where the injustice experienced
by African Americans

00:20:02.895 --> 00:20:05.526
and other communities
of color are concerned,

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:10.560
the differential in pay between
African Americans and majority Americans

00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:13.868
is the same as it was in 1968,

00:20:13.892 --> 00:20:16.626
and the family wealth,

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.042
the net worth --

00:20:18.066 --> 00:20:23.141
it takes 11 and a half so-called
"typical" African American families

00:20:23.165 --> 00:20:28.569
to make up the net worth of one
so-called "typical" White American family.

00:20:28.593 --> 00:20:32.588
And you look at the soaring incomes

00:20:32.612 --> 00:20:36.153
in the top one
or the top one-tenth of one percent,

00:20:36.177 --> 00:20:37.723
and people say, "Wait a minute.

00:20:37.747 --> 00:20:41.865
Whoever the experts were
that designed these policies,

00:20:41.889 --> 00:20:45.966
they haven't been doing
a good job for me."

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.060
A final point, Chris:

00:20:48.084 --> 00:20:51.147
there has been an assault on reason.

00:20:51.171 --> 00:20:54.380
There has been a war against truth.

00:20:54.404 --> 00:20:57.585
There has been a strategy,

00:20:57.609 --> 00:21:03.060
maybe it was best known as a strategy
decades ago by the tobacco companies

00:21:03.084 --> 00:21:08.064
who hired actors and dressed them up
as doctors to falsely reassure people

00:21:08.088 --> 00:21:11.505
that there were no health consequences
from smoking cigarettes,

00:21:11.529 --> 00:21:14.882
and a hundred million people
died as a result.

00:21:14.906 --> 00:21:20.854
That same strategy of diminishing
the significance of truth,

00:21:20.878 --> 00:21:25.152
diminishing, as someone said,
the authority of knowledge,

00:21:25.176 --> 00:21:29.509
I think that has made it
kind of open season

00:21:29.533 --> 00:21:34.096
on any inconvenient truth --
forgive another buzz phrase,

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.426
but it is apt.

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:42.880
We cannot abandon our devotion
to the best available evidence

00:21:42.904 --> 00:21:45.952
tested in reasoned discourse

00:21:45.976 --> 00:21:48.464
and used as the basis

00:21:48.488 --> 00:21:51.708
for the best policies we can form.

00:21:51.732 --> 00:21:55.298
CA: Is it possible, Al,
that one consequence of the pandemic

00:21:55.322 --> 00:21:58.093
is actually a growing number of people

00:21:58.117 --> 00:22:01.406
have revisited their opinions
on scientists?

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.190
I mean, you've had a chance
in the last few months to say,

00:22:04.214 --> 00:22:07.502
"Do I trust my political leader
or do I trust this scientist

00:22:07.526 --> 00:22:09.470
in terms of what they're saying

00:22:09.494 --> 00:22:11.921
about this virus?"

00:22:11.945 --> 00:22:14.646
Maybe lessons from that
could be carried forward?

00:22:15.646 --> 00:22:19.408
AG: Well, you know, I think
if the polling is accurate,

00:22:19.432 --> 00:22:25.231
people do trust their doctors
a lot more than some of the politicians

00:22:25.255 --> 00:22:30.564
who seem to have a vested interest
in pretending the pandemic isn't real.

00:22:30.588 --> 00:22:34.419
And if you look at the incredible bust

00:22:34.443 --> 00:22:37.927
at President Trump's rally in Tulsa,

00:22:37.951 --> 00:22:44.942
a stadium of 19,000 people
with less than one-third filled,

00:22:44.966 --> 00:22:46.496
according to the fire marshal,

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:50.057
you saw all the empty seats
if you saw the news clips,

00:22:50.081 --> 00:22:54.727
so even the most loyal Trump supporters

00:22:54.751 --> 00:23:00.310
must have decided to trust their doctors
and the medical advice

00:23:00.334 --> 00:23:04.017
rather than Dr. Donald Trump.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:08.104
CA: With a little help from
the TikTok generation, perchance.

00:23:08.128 --> 00:23:10.693
AG: Well, but that didn't
affect the turnout.

00:23:10.717 --> 00:23:14.776
What they did, very cleverly,
and I'm cheering them on,

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:21.367
what they did was affect
the Trump White House's expectations.

00:23:21.391 --> 00:23:25.759
They're the reason why he went out
a couple days beforehand

00:23:25.783 --> 00:23:28.192
and said, "We've had
a million people sign up."

00:23:28.216 --> 00:23:29.829
But they didn't prevent --

00:23:29.853 --> 00:23:34.175
they didn't take seats that others
could have otherwise taken.

00:23:34.199 --> 00:23:37.047
They didn't affect the turnout,
just the expectations.

00:23:37.071 --> 00:23:39.982
CA: OK, let's have our next question here.

00:23:42.848 --> 00:23:46.343
"Are you concerned the world will rush
back to the use of the private car

00:23:46.367 --> 00:23:49.458
out of fear of using
shared public transportation?"

00:23:50.923 --> 00:23:57.792
AG: Well, that could actually be
one of the consequences, absolutely.

00:23:57.816 --> 00:24:01.236
Now, the trends on mass transit

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:04.713
were already inching
in the wrong direction

00:24:04.737 --> 00:24:09.706
because of Uber and Lyft
and the ridesharing services,

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:16.420
and if autonomy ever reaches the goals
that its advocates have hoped for

00:24:16.444 --> 00:24:20.434
then that may also have a similar effect.

00:24:20.458 --> 00:24:24.314
But there's no doubt that some people

00:24:24.338 --> 00:24:29.821
are going to be probably
a little more reluctant

00:24:29.845 --> 00:24:32.446
to take mass transportation

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:39.448
until the fear of this pandemic
is well and truly gone.

00:24:39.472 --> 00:24:42.267
CA: Yeah. Might need
a vaccine on that one.

00:24:42.291 --> 00:24:43.808
AG: (Laughs) Yeah.

00:24:43.832 --> 00:24:45.060
CA: Next question.

00:24:48.233 --> 00:24:50.855
Sonaar Luthra, thank you
for this question from LA.

00:24:50.879 --> 00:24:53.558
"Given the temperature rise
in the Arctic this past week,

00:24:53.582 --> 00:24:55.939
seems like the rate
we are losing our carbon sinks

00:24:55.963 --> 00:24:57.208
like permafrost or forests

00:24:57.232 --> 00:24:59.436
is accelerating faster than we predicted.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.898
Are our models too focused
on human emissions?"

00:25:02.922 --> 00:25:04.073
Interesting question.

00:25:04.097 --> 00:25:09.362
AG: Well, the models are focused
on the factors that have led

00:25:09.386 --> 00:25:12.863
to these incredible temperature spikes

00:25:12.887 --> 00:25:14.888
in the north of the Arctic Circle.

00:25:14.912 --> 00:25:18.003
They were predicted,
they have been predicted,

00:25:18.027 --> 00:25:20.845
and one of the reasons for it

00:25:20.869 --> 00:25:24.498
is that as the snow and ice cover melts,

00:25:24.522 --> 00:25:29.355
the sun's incoming rays are no longer
reflected back into space

00:25:29.379 --> 00:25:31.514
at a 90 percent rate,

00:25:31.538 --> 00:25:35.825
and instead, when they fall on
the dark tundra or the dark ocean,

00:25:35.849 --> 00:25:38.179
they're absorbed at a 90 percent rate.

00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:44.050
So that's a magnifier
of the warming in the Arctic,

00:25:44.074 --> 00:25:45.828
and this has been predicted.

00:25:45.852 --> 00:25:49.978
There are a number of other consequences
that are also in the models,

00:25:50.002 --> 00:25:53.776
but some of them
may have to be recalibrated.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.441
The scientists are freshly concerned

00:25:57.465 --> 00:26:02.579
that the emissions of both CO2 and methane

00:26:02.603 --> 00:26:05.415
from the thawing tundra

00:26:05.439 --> 00:26:10.200
could be larger than they
had hoped they would be.

00:26:10.224 --> 00:26:14.124
There's also just been a brand-new study.

00:26:14.148 --> 00:26:15.731
I won't spend time on this,

00:26:15.755 --> 00:26:19.769
because it deals with a kind of geeky term
called "climate sensitivity,"

00:26:19.793 --> 00:26:24.999
which has been a factor in the models
with large error bars

00:26:25.023 --> 00:26:27.312
because it's so hard to pin down.

00:26:27.336 --> 00:26:30.529
But the latest evidence
indicates, worryingly,

00:26:30.553 --> 00:26:34.164
that the sensitivity may be
greater than they had thought,

00:26:34.188 --> 00:26:38.007
and we will have
an even more daunting task.

00:26:38.031 --> 00:26:40.091
That shouldn't discourage us.

00:26:40.115 --> 00:26:43.744
I truly believe that once
we cross this tipping point,

00:26:43.768 --> 00:26:45.830
and I do believe we're doing it now,

00:26:45.854 --> 00:26:47.066
as I've said,

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:50.388
then I think we're going
to find a lot of ways

00:26:50.412 --> 00:26:52.979
to speed up the emissions reductions.

00:26:54.369 --> 00:26:56.850
CA: We'll take one more question
from the community.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:02.153
Haha. "Geoengineering
is making extraordinary progress.

00:27:02.177 --> 00:27:07.163
Exxon is investing in technology
from Global Thermostat

00:27:07.187 --> 00:27:08.810
that seems promising.

00:27:08.834 --> 00:27:13.181
What do you think of these air and water
carbon capture technologies?"

00:27:13.205 --> 00:27:14.638
Stephen Petranek.

00:27:15.331 --> 00:27:19.360
AG: Yeah. Well, you and I have
talked about this before, Chris.

00:27:19.384 --> 00:27:23.366
I've been strongly opposed

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:29.853
to conducting an unplanned
global experiment

00:27:29.877 --> 00:27:34.063
that could go wildly wrong,

00:27:34.087 --> 00:27:37.825
and most are really
scared of that approach.

00:27:37.849 --> 00:27:43.758
However, the term "geoengineering"
is a nuanced term that covers a lot.

00:27:43.782 --> 00:27:49.696
If you want to paint roofs white
to reflect more energy

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:53.591
from the cityscapes,

00:27:53.615 --> 00:27:58.210
that's not going to bring a danger
of a runaway effect,

00:27:58.234 --> 00:27:59.828
and there are some other things

00:27:59.852 --> 00:28:03.707
that are loosely called "geoengineering"
like that, which are fine.

00:28:03.731 --> 00:28:09.034
But the idea of blocking out
the sun's rays --

00:28:09.058 --> 00:28:11.430
that's insane in my opinion.

00:28:11.454 --> 00:28:15.049
Turns out plants need sunlight
for photosynthesis

00:28:15.073 --> 00:28:17.404
and solar panels need sunlight

00:28:17.428 --> 00:28:23.053
for producing electricity
from the sun's rays.

00:28:23.077 --> 00:28:28.023
And the consequences of changing
everything we know

00:28:28.047 --> 00:28:34.515
and pretending that the consequences
are going to precisely cancel out

00:28:34.539 --> 00:28:40.401
the unplanned experiment of global warming
that we already have underway,

00:28:40.425 --> 00:28:42.774
you know, there are
glitches in our thinking.

00:28:42.798 --> 00:28:45.107
One of them is called
the "single solution bias,"

00:28:45.131 --> 00:28:48.813
and there are people
who just have a hunger to say,

00:28:48.837 --> 00:28:52.368
"Well, that one solution, we just need
to latch on to that and do that,

00:28:52.392 --> 00:28:54.029
and damn the consequences."

00:28:54.053 --> 00:28:55.750
Well, it's nuts.

00:28:55.774 --> 00:28:58.358
CA: But let me push back on this
just a little bit.

00:28:58.382 --> 00:29:01.458
So let's say that we agree
that a single solution,

00:29:01.482 --> 00:29:05.999
all-or-nothing attempt
at geoengineering is crazy.

00:29:06.023 --> 00:29:11.191
But there are scenarios where the world
looks at emissions and just sees,

00:29:11.215 --> 00:29:12.964
in 10 years' time, let's say,

00:29:12.988 --> 00:29:15.778
that they are just not
coming down fast enough

00:29:15.802 --> 00:29:19.844
and that we are at risk
of several other liftoff events

00:29:19.868 --> 00:29:22.583
where this train will just
get away from us,

00:29:22.607 --> 00:29:27.801
and we will see temperature rises
of three, four, five, six, seven degrees,

00:29:27.825 --> 00:29:31.485
and all of civilization is at risk.

00:29:31.509 --> 00:29:35.496
Surely, there is an approach
to geoengineering

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:39.296
that could be modeled, in a way,
on the way that we approach medicine.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.728
Like, for hundreds of years,
we don't really understand the human body,

00:29:42.752 --> 00:29:45.101
people would try interventions,

00:29:45.125 --> 00:29:49.536
and some of them would work,
and some of them wouldn't.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.518
No one says in medicine, "You know,

00:29:52.542 --> 00:29:57.058
go in and take an all-or-nothing decision

00:29:57.082 --> 00:29:58.634
on someone's life,"

00:29:58.658 --> 00:30:00.595
but they do say, "Let's try some stuff."

00:30:00.619 --> 00:30:03.353
If an experiment can be reversible,

00:30:03.377 --> 00:30:05.178
if it's plausible in the first place,

00:30:05.202 --> 00:30:07.837
if there's reason to think
that it might work,

00:30:07.861 --> 00:30:12.810
we actually owe it to
the future health of humanity

00:30:12.834 --> 00:30:16.623
to try at least some types of tests
to see what could work.

00:30:16.647 --> 00:30:20.607
So, small tests to see
whether, for example,

00:30:20.631 --> 00:30:23.210
seeding of something in the ocean

00:30:23.234 --> 00:30:27.400
might create, in a nonthreatening way,

00:30:27.424 --> 00:30:28.881
carbon sinks.

00:30:28.905 --> 00:30:33.488
Or maybe, rather than filling
the atmosphere with sulfur dioxide,

00:30:33.512 --> 00:30:37.861
a smaller experiment
that was not that big a deal

00:30:37.885 --> 00:30:41.756
to see whether, cost-effectively, you
could reduce the temperature a little bit.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.205
Surely, that isn't completely crazy

00:30:44.229 --> 00:30:46.745
and is at least something
we should be thinking about

00:30:46.769 --> 00:30:49.101
in case these other measures don't work?

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:53.631
AG: Well, there've already been
such experiments

00:30:53.655 --> 00:30:55.048
to seed the ocean

00:30:55.072 --> 00:30:59.793
to see if that can increase
the uptake of CO2.

00:30:59.817 --> 00:31:03.830
And the experiments
were an unmitigated failure,

00:31:03.854 --> 00:31:07.122
as many predicted they would be.

00:31:07.146 --> 00:31:11.066
But that, again, is the kind of approach

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:12.247
that's very different

00:31:12.271 --> 00:31:16.493
from putting tinfoil strips
in the atmosphere orbiting the Earth.

00:31:16.517 --> 00:31:22.295
That was the way that solar
geoengineering proposal started.

00:31:22.319 --> 00:31:25.683
Now they're focusing on chalk,

00:31:25.707 --> 00:31:29.669
so we have chalk dust all over everything.

00:31:29.693 --> 00:31:36.174
But more serious than that is the fact
that it might not be reversible.

00:31:36.198 --> 00:31:38.926
CA: But, Al, that's the rhetoric response.

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:42.077
The amount of dust that you need

00:31:42.101 --> 00:31:45.383
to drop by a degree or two

00:31:45.407 --> 00:31:47.926
wouldn't result in chalk dust
over everything.

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:49.753
It would be unbelievably --

00:31:49.777 --> 00:31:55.083
like, it would be less than the dust
that people experience every day, anyway.

00:31:55.107 --> 00:31:56.842
I mean, I just --

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:02.680
AG: First of all, I don't know
how you do a small experiment

00:32:02.704 --> 00:32:04.224
in the atmosphere.

00:32:04.248 --> 00:32:06.283
And secondly,

00:32:06.307 --> 00:32:09.672
if we were to take that approach,

00:32:09.696 --> 00:32:13.621
we would have to steadily
increase the amount

00:32:13.645 --> 00:32:15.770
of whatever substance they decided.

00:32:15.794 --> 00:32:19.385
We'd have to increase
it every single year,

00:32:19.409 --> 00:32:21.197
and if we ever stopped,

00:32:21.221 --> 00:32:26.701
then there would be a sudden snapback,

00:32:26.725 --> 00:32:32.045
like "The Picture of Dorian Gray,"
that old book and movie,

00:32:32.069 --> 00:32:36.985
where suddenly all of the things
caught up with you at once.

00:32:37.009 --> 00:32:41.401
The fact that anyone is even
considering these approaches, Chris,

00:32:41.425 --> 00:32:45.855
is a measure of a feeling of desperation

00:32:45.879 --> 00:32:50.137
that some have begun to feel,

00:32:50.161 --> 00:32:52.105
which I understand,

00:32:52.129 --> 00:32:59.129
but I don't think it should drive us
toward these reckless experiments.

00:32:59.153 --> 00:33:03.496
And by the way, using your analogy
to experimental cancer treatments,

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.787
for example,

00:33:04.811 --> 00:33:08.049
you usually get informed consent
from the patient.

00:33:08.073 --> 00:33:11.592
Getting informed consent
from 7.8 billion people

00:33:11.616 --> 00:33:14.296
who have no voice and no say,

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:19.397
who are subject to the potentially
catastrophic consequences

00:33:19.421 --> 00:33:23.841
of this wackadoodle proposal
that somebody comes up with

00:33:23.865 --> 00:33:27.805
to try to rearrange
the entire Earth's atmosphere

00:33:27.829 --> 00:33:31.042
and hope and pretend
that it's going to cancel out,

00:33:31.066 --> 00:33:36.002
the fact that we're putting
152 million tons

00:33:36.026 --> 00:33:38.645
of heat-trapping, manmade
global warming pollution

00:33:38.669 --> 00:33:40.683
into the sky every day.

00:33:40.707 --> 00:33:43.793
That's what's really insane.

00:33:43.817 --> 00:33:46.361
A scientist decades ago

00:33:46.385 --> 00:33:47.810
compared it this way.

00:33:47.834 --> 00:33:51.110
He said, if you had two people
on a sinking boat

00:33:51.134 --> 00:33:53.530
and one of them says,

00:33:53.554 --> 00:33:58.527
"You know, we could probably use
some mirrors to signal to shore

00:33:58.551 --> 00:34:00.242
to get them to build

00:34:00.266 --> 00:34:02.725
a sophisticated wave-generating machine

00:34:02.749 --> 00:34:06.872
that will cancel out
the rocking of the boat

00:34:06.896 --> 00:34:08.772
by these guys in the back of the boat."

00:34:08.796 --> 00:34:11.219
Or you could get them
to stop rocking the boat.

00:34:11.243 --> 00:34:16.135
And that's what we need to do.
We need to stop what's causing the crisis.

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:17.676
CA: Yeah, that's a great story,

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:21.581
but if the effort to stop the people
rocking in the back of the boat

00:34:21.605 --> 00:34:25.871
is as complex as the scientific
proposal you just outlined,

00:34:25.895 --> 00:34:28.902
whereas the experiment to stop the waves

00:34:28.926 --> 00:34:32.326
is actually as simple as telling
the people to stop rocking the boat,

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:33.609
that story changes.

00:34:33.633 --> 00:34:38.010
And I think you're right that
the issue of informed consent

00:34:38.034 --> 00:34:39.575
is a really challenging one,

00:34:39.599 --> 00:34:41.580
but, I mean, no one gave informed consent

00:34:41.604 --> 00:34:46.009
to do all of the other things
we're doing to the atmosphere.

00:34:46.033 --> 00:34:49.526
And I agree that the moral hazard issue

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:51.471
is worrying,

00:34:51.495 --> 00:34:55.677
that if we became dependent
on geoengineering

00:34:55.701 --> 00:34:58.690
and took away our efforts to do the rest,

00:34:58.714 --> 00:35:00.034
that would be tragic.

00:35:00.058 --> 00:35:01.341
It just seems like,

00:35:01.365 --> 00:35:03.829
I wish it was possible
to have a nuanced debate

00:35:03.853 --> 00:35:05.482
of people saying, you know what,

00:35:05.506 --> 00:35:07.966
there's multiple dials
to a very complex problem.

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:11.098
We're going to have to adjust
several of them very, very carefully

00:35:11.122 --> 00:35:14.170
and keep talking to each other.

00:35:14.194 --> 00:35:15.754
Wouldn't that be a goal

00:35:15.778 --> 00:35:18.333
to just try and have
a more nuanced debate about this,

00:35:18.357 --> 00:35:20.797
rather than all of that geoengineering

00:35:20.821 --> 00:35:22.058
can't work?

00:35:22.995 --> 00:35:26.171
AG: Well, I've said some of it,

00:35:26.195 --> 00:35:28.651
you know, the benign forms
that I've mentioned,

00:35:28.675 --> 00:35:30.696
I'm not ruling those out.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:34.801
But blocking the Sun's rays
from the Earth,

00:35:34.825 --> 00:35:40.639
not only do you affect 7.8 billion people,

00:35:40.663 --> 00:35:42.658
you affect the plants

00:35:42.682 --> 00:35:44.215
and the animals

00:35:44.239 --> 00:35:45.928
and the ocean currents

00:35:45.952 --> 00:35:47.637
and the wind currents

00:35:47.661 --> 00:35:50.555
and natural processes

00:35:50.579 --> 00:35:57.417
that we're in danger
of disrupting even more.

00:35:57.441 --> 00:36:04.304
Techno-optimism is something
I've engaged in in the past,

00:36:04.328 --> 00:36:11.328
but to latch on to some
brand-new technological solution

00:36:11.352 --> 00:36:15.467
to rework the entire Earth's
natural system

00:36:15.491 --> 00:36:18.444
because somebody thinks he's clever enough

00:36:18.468 --> 00:36:22.391
to do it in a way
that precisely cancels out

00:36:22.415 --> 00:36:26.281
the consequences of using
the atmosphere as an open sewer

00:36:26.305 --> 00:36:28.684
for heat-trapping manmade gases.

00:36:28.708 --> 00:36:32.542
It's much more important to stop using
the atmosphere as an open sewer.

00:36:32.566 --> 00:36:34.523
That's what the problem is.

00:36:34.547 --> 00:36:38.369
CA: All right, well, we'll agree that that
is the most important thing, for sure,

00:36:38.393 --> 00:36:39.564
and speaking of which,

00:36:39.588 --> 00:36:42.999
do you believe the world
needs carbon pricing,

00:36:43.023 --> 00:36:45.973
and is there any prospect
for getting there?

00:36:47.263 --> 00:36:51.744
AG: Yes. Yes to both questions.

00:36:51.768 --> 00:36:55.109
For decades, almost every economist

00:36:55.133 --> 00:36:57.626
who is asked about the climate crisis

00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:00.163
says, "Well, we just need
to put a price on carbon."

00:37:00.187 --> 00:37:05.076
And I have certainly been
in favor of that approach.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.296
But it is daunting.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:11.104
Nevertheless, there are
43 jurisdictions around the world

00:37:11.128 --> 00:37:14.757
that already have a price on carbon.

00:37:14.781 --> 00:37:16.064
We're seeing it in Europe.

00:37:16.088 --> 00:37:19.612
They finally straightened out
their carbon pricing mechanism.

00:37:19.636 --> 00:37:22.717
It's an emissions trading version of it.

00:37:22.741 --> 00:37:25.902
We have places that have put
a tax on carbon.

00:37:25.926 --> 00:37:29.533
That's the approach the economists prefer.

00:37:29.557 --> 00:37:33.819
China is beginning to implement
its national emissions trading program.

00:37:33.843 --> 00:37:39.172
California and quite a few other states
in the US are already doing it.

00:37:39.196 --> 00:37:44.834
It can be given back to people
in a revenue-neutral way.

00:37:44.858 --> 00:37:48.947
But the opposition to it, Chris,
which you've noted,

00:37:48.971 --> 00:37:54.263
is impressive enough
that we do have to take other approaches,

00:37:54.287 --> 00:37:58.129
and I would say most climate activists
are now saying, look,

00:37:58.153 --> 00:38:00.998
let's don't make the best
the enemy of the better.

00:38:01.022 --> 00:38:03.050
There are other ways to do this as well.

00:38:03.074 --> 00:38:08.069
We need every solution
we can rationally employ,

00:38:08.093 --> 00:38:12.322
including by regulation.

00:38:12.346 --> 00:38:19.156
And often, when the political difficulty
of a proposal becomes too difficult

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:21.595
in a market-oriented approach,

00:38:21.619 --> 00:38:25.161
the fallback is with regulation,

00:38:25.185 --> 00:38:28.764
and it's been given
a bad name, regulation,

00:38:28.788 --> 00:38:31.333
but many places are doing it.

00:38:31.357 --> 00:38:34.139
I mentioned phasing out
internal combustion engines.

00:38:34.163 --> 00:38:36.258
That's an example.

00:38:36.282 --> 00:38:40.474
There are 160 cities in the US

00:38:40.498 --> 00:38:45.226
that have already by regulation ordered
that within a date certain,

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:50.573
100 percent of all their electricity
will have to come from renewable sources.

00:38:50.597 --> 00:38:56.044
And again, the market forces that
are driving the cost of renewable energy

00:38:56.068 --> 00:38:59.919
and sustainability solutions
ever downward,

00:38:59.943 --> 00:39:02.488
that gives us the wind at our back.

00:39:02.512 --> 00:39:04.631
This is working in our favor.

00:39:05.779 --> 00:39:08.147
CA: I mean, the pushback on carbon pricing

00:39:08.171 --> 00:39:11.447
often goes further from parts
of the environmental movement,

00:39:11.471 --> 00:39:14.564
which is to a pushback
on the role of business in general.

00:39:14.588 --> 00:39:17.291
Business is actually -- well,
capitalism -- is blamed

00:39:17.315 --> 00:39:19.370
for the climate crisis

00:39:19.394 --> 00:39:23.182
because of unrelenting growth,

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:29.153
to the point where many people
don't trust business

00:39:29.177 --> 00:39:31.793
to be part of the solution.

00:39:31.817 --> 00:39:34.790
The only way to go forward
is to regulate,

00:39:34.814 --> 00:39:36.834
to force businesses to do the right thing.

00:39:36.858 --> 00:39:40.823
Do you think that business
has to be part of the solution?

00:39:42.371 --> 00:39:43.535
AG: Well, definitely,

00:39:43.559 --> 00:39:49.064
because the allocation of capital
needed to solve this crisis

00:39:49.088 --> 00:39:53.664
is greater than what
governments can handle.

00:39:53.688 --> 00:39:56.822
And businesses are beginning,

00:39:56.846 --> 00:40:01.891
many businesses are beginning
to play a very constructive role.

00:40:01.915 --> 00:40:05.617
They're getting a demand that they do so

00:40:05.641 --> 00:40:07.841
from their customers,
from their investors,

00:40:07.865 --> 00:40:09.815
from their boards,

00:40:09.839 --> 00:40:12.555
from their executive teams,
from their families.

00:40:12.579 --> 00:40:14.083
And by the way,

00:40:14.107 --> 00:40:18.297
the rising generation is demanding
a brighter future,

00:40:18.321 --> 00:40:21.844
and when CEOs interview
potential new hires,

00:40:21.868 --> 00:40:25.804
they find that the new hires
are interviewing them.

00:40:25.828 --> 00:40:28.466
They want to make a nice income,

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:32.121
but they want to be able to tell
their family and friends and peers

00:40:32.145 --> 00:40:36.061
that they're doing something
more than just making money.

00:40:36.085 --> 00:40:41.255
One illustration of how
this new generation is changing, Chris:

00:40:41.279 --> 00:40:45.007
there are 65 colleges in the US right now

00:40:45.031 --> 00:40:49.655
where the College Young Republican Clubs
have joined together

00:40:49.679 --> 00:40:52.955
to jointly demand that
the Republican National Committee

00:40:52.979 --> 00:40:54.926
change its policy on climate,

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:58.156
lest they lose that entire generation.

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.649
This is a global phenomenon.

00:41:00.673 --> 00:41:04.479
The Greta Generation is now leading this

00:41:04.503 --> 00:41:07.076
in so many ways,

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.805
and if you look at the polling,

00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:13.807
again, the vast majority
of young Republicans

00:41:13.831 --> 00:41:17.115
are demanding a change on climate policy.

00:41:17.139 --> 00:41:20.906
This is really a movement

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:23.441
that is building still.

00:41:24.302 --> 00:41:26.131
CA: I was going to ask you about that,

00:41:26.155 --> 00:41:29.322
because one of the most painful things
over the last 20 years

00:41:29.346 --> 00:41:32.172
has just been how climate
has been politicized,

00:41:32.196 --> 00:41:34.907
certainly in the US.

00:41:34.931 --> 00:41:38.212
You've probably felt yourself
at the heart of that a lot of the time,

00:41:38.236 --> 00:41:40.023
with people attacking you personally

00:41:40.047 --> 00:41:44.086
in the most merciless,
and unfair ways, often.

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:48.785
Do you really see signs
that that might be changing,

00:41:48.809 --> 00:41:50.460
led by the next generation?

00:41:51.285 --> 00:41:54.206
AG: Yeah, there's no question about it.

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:56.101
I don't want to rely on polls too much.

00:41:56.125 --> 00:41:57.544
I've mentioned them already.

00:41:57.568 --> 00:41:59.353
But there was a new one that came out

00:41:59.377 --> 00:42:04.044
that looked at the wavering
Trump supporters,

00:42:04.068 --> 00:42:06.272
those who supported him
strongly in the past

00:42:06.296 --> 00:42:07.580
and want to do so again.

00:42:07.604 --> 00:42:11.037
The number one issue,
surprisingly to some,

00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:12.842
that is giving them pause,

00:42:12.866 --> 00:42:18.129
is the craziness of President Trump
and his administration on climate.

00:42:18.153 --> 00:42:23.686
We're seeing big majorities
of the Republican Party overall

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:27.721
saying that they're ready
to start exploring some real solutions

00:42:27.745 --> 00:42:29.043
to the climate crisis.

00:42:29.067 --> 00:42:32.136
I think that we're really getting there,
no question about it.

00:42:32.866 --> 00:42:35.915
CA: I mean, you've been
the figurehead for raising this issue,

00:42:35.939 --> 00:42:38.992
and you happen to be a Democrat.

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:43.564
Is there anything
that you can personally do

00:42:43.588 --> 00:42:46.434
to -- I don't know -- to open the tent,
to welcome people,

00:42:46.458 --> 00:42:49.680
to try and say, "This is
beyond politics, dear friends"?

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:53.733
AG: Yeah. Well, I've tried
all of those things,

00:42:53.757 --> 00:42:59.919
and maybe it's made a little
positive difference.

00:42:59.943 --> 00:43:02.717
I've worked with
the Republicans extensively.

00:43:02.741 --> 00:43:07.005
And, you know, well after
I left the White House,

00:43:07.029 --> 00:43:10.883
I had Newt Gingrich and Pat Robertson

00:43:10.907 --> 00:43:13.028
and other prominent Republicans

00:43:13.052 --> 00:43:15.667
appear on national TV ads with me

00:43:15.691 --> 00:43:18.510
saying we've got to solve
the climate crisis.

00:43:18.534 --> 00:43:22.996
But the petroleum industry

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:26.912
has really doubled down

00:43:26.936 --> 00:43:30.329
enforcing discipline
within the Republican Party.

00:43:30.353 --> 00:43:33.778
I mean, look at the attacks
they've launched against the Pope

00:43:33.802 --> 00:43:37.080
when he came out with his encyclical

00:43:37.104 --> 00:43:39.322
and was demonized,

00:43:39.346 --> 00:43:40.693
not by all for sure,

00:43:40.717 --> 00:43:45.355
but there were hawks
in the anti-climate movement

00:43:45.379 --> 00:43:51.329
who immediately started
training their guns on Pope Francis,

00:43:51.353 --> 00:43:54.126
and there are many other examples.

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:55.552
They enforce discipline

00:43:55.576 --> 00:43:58.637
and try to make it a partisan issue,

00:43:58.661 --> 00:44:00.665
even as Democrats reach out

00:44:00.689 --> 00:44:03.350
to try to make it bipartisan.

00:44:03.374 --> 00:44:07.441
I totally agree with you
that it should not be a partisan issue.

00:44:07.465 --> 00:44:09.566
It didn't use to be,

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:13.580
but it's been artificially
weaponized as an issue.

00:44:13.604 --> 00:44:16.106
CA: I mean, the CEOs
of oil companies also have kids

00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:18.882
who are talking to them.

00:44:18.906 --> 00:44:20.987
It feels like some of them are moving

00:44:21.011 --> 00:44:22.891
and are trying to invest

00:44:22.915 --> 00:44:26.339
and trying to find ways
of being part of the future.

00:44:26.363 --> 00:44:27.722
Do you see signs of that?

00:44:28.992 --> 00:44:30.152
AG: Yeah.

00:44:30.176 --> 00:44:35.236
I think that business leaders,
including in the oil and gas companies,

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:38.781
are hearing from their families.

00:44:38.805 --> 00:44:40.931
They're hearing from their friends.

00:44:40.955 --> 00:44:43.785
They're hearing from their employees.

00:44:43.809 --> 00:44:47.422
And, by the way, we've seen
in the tech industry

00:44:47.446 --> 00:44:50.861
some mass walkouts by employees

00:44:50.885 --> 00:44:54.991
who are demanding
that some of the tech companies

00:44:55.015 --> 00:44:56.769
do more and get serious.

00:44:56.793 --> 00:44:58.234
I'm so proud of Apple.

00:44:58.258 --> 00:45:01.291
Forgive me for parenthetically
praising Apple.

00:45:01.315 --> 00:45:04.415
You know, I'm on the board,
but I'm such a big fan of Tim Cook

00:45:04.439 --> 00:45:06.690
and my colleagues at Apple.

00:45:06.714 --> 00:45:09.255
It's an example of a tech company

00:45:09.279 --> 00:45:11.549
that's really doing fantastic things.

00:45:11.573 --> 00:45:13.279
And there's some others as well.

00:45:13.303 --> 00:45:16.744
There are others in many industries.

00:45:16.768 --> 00:45:20.668
But the pressures on
the oil and gas companies

00:45:20.692 --> 00:45:22.707
are quite extraordinary.

00:45:22.731 --> 00:45:27.337
You know, BP just wrote down
12 and a half billion dollars' worth

00:45:27.361 --> 00:45:31.112
of oil and gas assets

00:45:31.136 --> 00:45:35.084
and said that they're never
going to see the light of day.

00:45:35.108 --> 00:45:40.564
Two-thirds of the fossil fuels
that have already been discovered

00:45:40.588 --> 00:45:44.545
cannot be burned and will not be burned.

00:45:44.569 --> 00:45:50.322
And so that's a big economic risk
to the global economy,

00:45:50.346 --> 00:45:52.126
like the subprime mortgage crisis.

00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:56.849
We've got 22 trillion dollars
of subprime carbon assets,

00:45:56.873 --> 00:45:59.277
and just yesterday,
there was a major report

00:45:59.301 --> 00:46:02.222
that the fracking industry in the US

00:46:02.246 --> 00:46:05.834
is seeing now a wave of bankruptcies

00:46:05.858 --> 00:46:09.473
because the price
of the fracked gas and oil

00:46:09.497 --> 00:46:15.113
has fallen below levels
that make them economic.

00:46:15.137 --> 00:46:17.276
CA: Is the shorthand
of what's happened there

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:22.263
that electric cars and electric
technologies and solar and so forth

00:46:22.287 --> 00:46:25.139
have helped drive down the price of oil

00:46:25.163 --> 00:46:27.365
to the point where
huge amounts of the reserves

00:46:27.389 --> 00:46:30.700
just can't be developed profitably?

00:46:31.509 --> 00:46:33.383
AG: Yes, that's it.

00:46:33.407 --> 00:46:35.583
That's mainly it.

00:46:35.607 --> 00:46:42.590
The projections for energy sources
in the next several years

00:46:42.614 --> 00:46:46.166
uniformly predict that electricity
from wind and solar

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:49.477
is going to continue to plummet in price,

00:46:49.501 --> 00:46:54.360
and therefore using gas or coal

00:46:54.384 --> 00:47:00.044
to make steam to turn the turbines

00:47:00.068 --> 00:47:01.876
is just not going to be economical.

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:05.406
Similarly, the electrification
of the transportation sector

00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:08.383
is having the same effect.

00:47:08.407 --> 00:47:13.012
Some are also looking at the trend

00:47:13.036 --> 00:47:16.274
in national, regional
and local governance.

00:47:16.298 --> 00:47:17.660
I mentioned this before,

00:47:17.684 --> 00:47:22.076
but they're predicting
a very different energy future.

00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:24.262
But let me come back, Chris,

00:47:24.286 --> 00:47:26.288
because we talked about business leaders.

00:47:26.312 --> 00:47:30.256
I think you were getting in a question
a moment ago about capitalism itself,

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.066
and I do want to say a word on that,

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:34.257
because there are a lot of people who say

00:47:34.281 --> 00:47:37.796
maybe capitalism is the basic problem.

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:44.323
I think the current form of capitalism
we have is desperately in need of reform.

00:47:44.347 --> 00:47:47.895
The short-term outlook is often mentioned,

00:47:47.919 --> 00:47:52.191
but the way we measure
what is of value to us

00:47:52.215 --> 00:47:57.239
is also at the heart of the crisis
of modern capitalism.

00:47:57.263 --> 00:48:01.123
Now, capitalism is at the base
of every successful economy,

00:48:01.147 --> 00:48:02.959
and it balances supply and demand,

00:48:02.983 --> 00:48:05.645
unlocks a higher fraction
of the human potential,

00:48:05.669 --> 00:48:07.915
and it's not going anywhere,

00:48:07.939 --> 00:48:11.074
but it needs to be reformed,

00:48:11.098 --> 00:48:13.519
because the way we measure
what's valuable now

00:48:13.543 --> 00:48:16.587
ignores so-called negative externalities

00:48:16.611 --> 00:48:18.274
like pollution.

00:48:18.298 --> 00:48:21.420
It also ignores positive externalities

00:48:21.444 --> 00:48:24.179
like investments
in education and health care,

00:48:24.203 --> 00:48:26.402
mental health care, family services.

00:48:26.426 --> 00:48:32.780
It ignores the depletion of resources
like groundwater and topsoil

00:48:32.804 --> 00:48:35.422
and the web of living species.

00:48:35.446 --> 00:48:39.934
And it ignores the distribution
of incomes and net worths,

00:48:39.958 --> 00:48:44.487
so when GDP goes up, people cheer,

00:48:44.511 --> 00:48:49.033
two percent, three percent -- wow! --
four percent, and they think, "Great!"

00:48:49.057 --> 00:48:52.479
But it's accompanied
by vast increases in pollution,

00:48:52.503 --> 00:48:56.769
chronic underinvestment in public goods,

00:48:56.793 --> 00:49:01.160
the depletion of irreplaceable
natural resources,

00:49:01.184 --> 00:49:06.628
and the worst inequality crisis we've seen
in more than a hundred years

00:49:06.652 --> 00:49:10.458
that is threatening the future
of both capitalism and democracy.

00:49:10.482 --> 00:49:12.879
So we have to change it.
We have to reform it.

00:49:13.776 --> 00:49:16.647
CA: So reform capitalism,
but don't throw it out.

00:49:16.671 --> 00:49:19.388
We're going to need it as a tool
as we go forward

00:49:19.412 --> 00:49:21.051
if we're to solve this.

00:49:21.075 --> 00:49:23.772
AG: Yeah, I think that's right,
and just one other point:

00:49:23.796 --> 00:49:27.701
the worst environmental abuses
in the last hundred years

00:49:27.725 --> 00:49:31.807
have been in jurisdictions
that experimented during the 20th century

00:49:31.831 --> 00:49:35.877
with the alternatives to capitalism
on the left and right.

00:49:36.408 --> 00:49:38.121
CA: Interesting. All right.

00:49:38.145 --> 00:49:40.409
Two last community questions quickly.

00:49:44.063 --> 00:49:45.672
Chadburn Blomquist:

00:49:45.696 --> 00:49:49.137
"As you are reading the tea leaves
of the impact of the current pandemic,

00:49:49.161 --> 00:49:52.604
what do you think in regard to
our response to combatting climate change

00:49:52.628 --> 00:49:54.833
will be the most impactful
lesson learned?"

00:49:55.878 --> 00:49:58.199
AG: Boy, that's a very
thoughtful question,

00:49:58.223 --> 00:50:02.869
and I wish my answer could rise
to the same level on short notice.

00:50:02.893 --> 00:50:05.060
I would say first,

00:50:05.084 --> 00:50:07.491
don't ignore the scientists.

00:50:07.515 --> 00:50:10.033
When there is virtual unanimity

00:50:10.057 --> 00:50:13.468
among the scientific and medical experts,

00:50:13.492 --> 00:50:14.688
pay attention.

00:50:14.712 --> 00:50:17.746
Don't let some politician dissuade you.

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:20.680
I think President Trump is slowly learning

00:50:20.704 --> 00:50:24.425
that's it's kind of difficult
to gaslight a virus.

00:50:24.449 --> 00:50:26.801
He tried to gaslight the virus in Tulsa.

00:50:26.825 --> 00:50:29.007
It didn't come off very well,

00:50:29.031 --> 00:50:34.872
and tragically, he decided
to recklessly roll the dice a month ago

00:50:34.896 --> 00:50:39.027
and ignore the recommendations
for people to wear masks

00:50:39.051 --> 00:50:40.291
and to socially distance

00:50:40.315 --> 00:50:42.072
and to do the other things,

00:50:42.096 --> 00:50:46.388
and I think that lesson
is beginning to take hold

00:50:46.412 --> 00:50:47.691
in a much stronger way.

00:50:47.715 --> 00:50:49.271
But beyond that, Chris,

00:50:49.295 --> 00:50:53.715
I think that this period of time
has been characterized

00:50:53.739 --> 00:50:59.252
by one of the most profound opportunities

00:50:59.276 --> 00:51:02.923
for people to rethink
the patterns of their lives

00:51:02.947 --> 00:51:08.864
and to consider whether or not
we can't do a lot of things better

00:51:08.888 --> 00:51:10.393
and differently.

00:51:10.417 --> 00:51:14.834
And I think that this rising
generation I mentioned before

00:51:14.858 --> 00:51:17.141
has been even more profoundly affected

00:51:17.165 --> 00:51:18.479
by this interlude,

00:51:18.503 --> 00:51:20.360
which I hope ends soon,

00:51:20.384 --> 00:51:22.108
but I hope the lessons endure.

00:51:22.132 --> 00:51:23.635
I expect they will.

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:28.123
CA: Yeah, it's amazing how many things
you can do without emitting carbon,

00:51:28.147 --> 00:51:29.869
that we've been forced to do.

00:51:29.893 --> 00:51:31.879
Let's have one more question here.

00:51:35.052 --> 00:51:38.064
Frank Hennessy: "Are you encouraged
by the ability of people

00:51:38.088 --> 00:51:40.980
to quickly adapt to the new
normal due to COVID-19

00:51:41.004 --> 00:51:44.221
as evidence that people can and will
change their habits

00:51:44.245 --> 00:51:46.225
to respond to climate change?"

00:51:47.898 --> 00:51:54.018
AG: Yes, but I think we have
to keep in mind

00:51:54.042 --> 00:51:57.357
that there is a crisis within this crisis.

00:51:57.381 --> 00:52:03.871
The impact on the African American
community, which I mentioned before,

00:52:03.895 --> 00:52:07.182
on the Latinx community,

00:52:07.206 --> 00:52:08.487
Indigenous peoples.

00:52:08.511 --> 00:52:11.463
The highest infection rate
is in the Navajo Nation right now.

00:52:11.487 --> 00:52:16.582
So some of these questions
appear differently

00:52:16.606 --> 00:52:22.464
to those who are really
getting the brunt of this crisis,

00:52:22.488 --> 00:52:29.441
and it is unacceptable
that we allow this to continue.

00:52:29.853 --> 00:52:33.333
It feels one way to you and me

00:52:33.357 --> 00:52:36.888
and perhaps to many in our audience today,

00:52:36.912 --> 00:52:39.724
but for low-income communities of color,

00:52:39.748 --> 00:52:41.818
it's an entirely different crisis,

00:52:41.842 --> 00:52:43.887
and we owe it to them

00:52:43.911 --> 00:52:46.097
and to all of us

00:52:46.121 --> 00:52:49.994
to get busy and to start
using the best science

00:52:50.018 --> 00:52:52.188
and solve this pandemic.

00:52:52.212 --> 00:52:54.988
You know the phrase "pandemic economics."

00:52:55.012 --> 00:52:57.724
Somebody said, the first principle
of pandemic economics

00:52:57.748 --> 00:52:59.433
is take care of the pandemic,

00:52:59.457 --> 00:53:02.558
and we're not doing that yet.

00:53:02.582 --> 00:53:05.310
We're seeing the president
try to goose the economy

00:53:05.334 --> 00:53:06.653
for his reelection,

00:53:06.677 --> 00:53:08.185
never mind the prediction

00:53:08.209 --> 00:53:11.852
of tens of thousands
of additional American deaths,

00:53:11.876 --> 00:53:14.574
and that is just
unforgivable in my opinion.

00:53:15.472 --> 00:53:17.856
CA: Thank you, Frank.

00:53:18.336 --> 00:53:22.455
So Al, you, along with others
in the community played a key role

00:53:22.479 --> 00:53:28.950
in encouraging TED to launch
this initiative called "Countdown."

00:53:28.974 --> 00:53:30.760
Thank you for that,

00:53:30.784 --> 00:53:34.196
and I guess this conversation
is continuing among many of us.

00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:37.837
If you're interested
in climate, watching this,

00:53:37.861 --> 00:53:42.164
check out the Countdown website,

00:53:42.188 --> 00:53:43.942
countdown.ted.com,

00:53:43.966 --> 00:53:47.616
and be part of 10/10/2020,

00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:52.226
when we are trying
to put out an alert to the world

00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:53.536
that climate can't wait,

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:55.265
that it really matters,

00:53:55.289 --> 00:53:57.969
and there's going to be
some amazing content

00:53:57.993 --> 00:54:00.364
free to the world on that day.

00:54:00.388 --> 00:54:04.901
Thank you, Al, for your inspiration
and support in doing that.

00:54:04.925 --> 00:54:07.272
I wonder whether you
could end today's session

00:54:07.296 --> 00:54:09.990
just by painting us a picture,

00:54:10.014 --> 00:54:14.948
like how might things roll out
over the next decade or so?

00:54:14.972 --> 00:54:18.836
Just tell us whether there is still
a story of hope here.

00:54:19.604 --> 00:54:20.935
AG: I'd be glad to.

00:54:20.959 --> 00:54:23.838
I've got to get one plug in.
I'll make it brief.

00:54:23.862 --> 00:54:27.632
July 18 through July 26,

00:54:27.656 --> 00:54:31.951
The Climate Reality Project
is having a global training.

00:54:31.975 --> 00:54:34.559
We've already had 8,000 people register.

00:54:34.583 --> 00:54:37.534
You can go to climatereality.com.

00:54:37.558 --> 00:54:39.386
Now, a bright future.

00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:42.973
It begins with all of the kinds of efforts

00:54:42.997 --> 00:54:46.187
that you've thrown yourself into
in organizing Countdown.

00:54:46.211 --> 00:54:49.385
Chris, you and your team have been amazing

00:54:49.409 --> 00:54:52.228
to work with,

00:54:52.252 --> 00:54:56.666
and I'm so excited
about the Countdown project.

00:54:56.690 --> 00:55:00.355
TED has an unparalleled ability

00:55:00.379 --> 00:55:02.756
to spread ideas that are worth spreading,

00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:04.718
to raise consciousness,

00:55:04.742 --> 00:55:06.831
to enlighten people around the world,

00:55:06.855 --> 00:55:11.104
and it's needed for climate
and the solutions to the climate crisis

00:55:11.128 --> 00:55:13.388
like it's never been needed before,

00:55:13.412 --> 00:55:17.095
and I just want to thank you
for what you personally are doing

00:55:17.119 --> 00:55:20.979
to organize this fantastic
Countdown program.

00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:24.312
CA: Thank you.

00:55:24.336 --> 00:55:26.241
And the world? Are we going to do this?

00:55:26.265 --> 00:55:28.747
Do you think that humanity
is going to pull this off

00:55:28.771 --> 00:55:32.345
and that our grandchildren

00:55:32.369 --> 00:55:34.192
are going to have beautiful lives

00:55:34.216 --> 00:55:36.788
where they can celebrate nature
and not spend every day

00:55:36.812 --> 00:55:40.374
in fear of the next tornado or tsunami?

00:55:41.303 --> 00:55:44.893
AG: I am optimistic that we will do it,

00:55:44.917 --> 00:55:48.532
but the answer is in our hands.

00:55:48.556 --> 00:55:53.299
We have seen dark times
in periods of the past,

00:55:53.323 --> 00:55:56.593
and we have risen to meet the challenge.

00:55:56.617 --> 00:56:01.763
We have limitations of our long
evolutionary heritage

00:56:01.787 --> 00:56:03.512
and elements of our culture,

00:56:03.536 --> 00:56:07.423
but we also have the ability
to transcend our limitations,

00:56:07.447 --> 00:56:08.796
and when the chips are down,

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:11.355
and when survival is at stake

00:56:11.379 --> 00:56:14.153
and when our children
and future generations are at stake,

00:56:14.177 --> 00:56:19.463
we're capable of more than we sometimes
allow ourselves to think we can do.

00:56:19.487 --> 00:56:21.509
This is such a time.

00:56:21.533 --> 00:56:24.729
I believe we will rise to the occasion,

00:56:24.753 --> 00:56:26.905
and we will create a bright,

00:56:26.929 --> 00:56:30.991
clean, prosperous, just and fair future.

00:56:31.015 --> 00:56:33.048
I believe it with all my heart.

00:56:34.339 --> 00:56:37.989
CA: Al Gore, thank you
for your life of work,

00:56:38.013 --> 00:56:40.054
for all you've done to elevate this issue

00:56:40.078 --> 00:56:41.977
and for spending this time with us now.

00:56:42.001 --> 00:56:43.167
Thank you.

00:56:43.191 --> 00:56:44.477
AG: Back at you. Thank you.
