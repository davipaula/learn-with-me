00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:17.063
I'm going to start by saying something
you think you know to be true.

00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:21.992
Your brain creates
all facets of your mind.

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:26.784
So then why do we treat
mental and physical illnesses

00:00:26.808 --> 00:00:27.982
so differently,

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.737
if we think we know
that the mind comes from the brain?

00:00:32.197 --> 00:00:34.078
As a neuroscientist, I'm often told

00:00:34.102 --> 00:00:37.090
that I'm not allowed to study
how internal states

00:00:37.114 --> 00:00:40.592
like anxiety or craving or loneliness

00:00:40.616 --> 00:00:42.409
are represented by the brain,

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:45.894
and so I decided to set out
and do exactly that.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.943
My research program is designed
to understand the mind

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:53.323
by investigating brain circuits.

00:00:53.347 --> 00:00:57.014
Specifically, how does our brain
give rise to emotion.

00:00:57.847 --> 00:01:00.791
It's really hard to study
feelings and emotions,

00:01:00.815 --> 00:01:02.882
because you can't measure them.

00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:07.610
Behavior is still the best and only window

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:10.184
into the emotional experience of another.

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:13.664
For both animals and people,

00:01:13.688 --> 00:01:16.355
yes, self-report is a behavioral output.

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:20.839
Motivated behaviors
fall into two general classes:

00:01:20.863 --> 00:01:23.313
seeking pleasure and avoiding pain.

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:26.528
The ability to approach things
that are good for you

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:28.345
and avoid things that are bad for you

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:29.678
is fundamental to survival.

00:01:29.702 --> 00:01:31.337
And in our modern-day society,

00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:34.779
trouble telling the difference
can be labeled as a mental illness.

00:01:35.653 --> 00:01:38.454
If I was having car trouble,

00:01:38.478 --> 00:01:40.319
and I took my car to the mechanic,

00:01:40.343 --> 00:01:43.911
the first thing they do
is look under the hood.

00:01:44.593 --> 00:01:47.021
But with mental health research,

00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:50.069
you can't just pop open the hood
with the press of a button.

00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:53.624
So this is why we do
experiments on animals.

00:01:53.648 --> 00:01:56.482
Specifically, in my lab, mice.

00:01:57.585 --> 00:02:01.328
To understand the brain, well,
we need to study brains.

00:02:01.752 --> 00:02:04.562
And for the first time, we actually can.

00:02:04.586 --> 00:02:06.205
We can pop open the hood.

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.681
We can look inside

00:02:07.705 --> 00:02:10.494
and do an experiment
and see what comes out.

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:16.727
Technology has opened new windows
into the black box that is our minds.

00:02:17.363 --> 00:02:20.966
The development of optogenetic tools

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.443
has allowed us unprecedented control
over specific neurons in the brain

00:02:25.467 --> 00:02:29.034
and how they talk to each other
by firing electrical signals.

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:33.324
We can genetically engineer neurons
to be light sensitive

00:02:33.348 --> 00:02:37.402
and then use light to control
how neurons fire.

00:02:37.426 --> 00:02:39.553
This can change an animal's behavior,

00:02:39.577 --> 00:02:43.212
giving us insight
into what that neural circuit can do.

00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:46.704
Want to know how scientists
figure this out?

00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:51.323
Scientists developed optogenetic tools
by borrowing knowledge

00:02:51.347 --> 00:02:53.480
from other basic science fields.

00:02:53.887 --> 00:02:58.759
Algae are single-celled organisms
that have evolved to swim towards light.

00:02:58.783 --> 00:03:03.236
And when blue light shines
onto the eyespot of an algae cell,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.514
a channel opens,
sending an electrical signal

00:03:05.538 --> 00:03:07.387
that makes little flagella flap

00:03:07.411 --> 00:03:09.910
and propels the algae towards sunlight.

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:13.545
If we clone this light-sensitive
part of the algae

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.255
and then add it to neurons
through genetic modification,

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:19.946
we can make neurons light-sensitive, too.

00:03:20.755 --> 00:03:22.692
Except, with neurons,

00:03:22.716 --> 00:03:26.236
when we shine light down
an optical fiber deep into the brain,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.204
we change how they send electrical signals
to other neurons in the brain

00:03:30.228 --> 00:03:33.053
and thus change the animal's behavior.

00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:35.712
With the help of my colleagues,

00:03:35.736 --> 00:03:38.585
I pioneered the use of optogenetic tools

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.407
to selectively target neurons
that are living in point A,

00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:46.105
sending messages down wires
aimed at point B,

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:51.153
leaving neighboring neurons
going other places unaffected.

00:03:52.347 --> 00:03:56.442
This approach allowed us to test
the function of each wire

00:03:56.466 --> 00:03:59.037
within the tangled mess that is our brain.

00:03:59.775 --> 00:04:01.585
A brain region called the amygdala

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.125
has long been thought
to be important for emotion,

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:05.839
and my laboratory discovered

00:04:05.863 --> 00:04:08.156
that the amygdala
resembles a fork in the road

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.323
where activating one path
can drive positive emotion and approach,

00:04:12.347 --> 00:04:16.763
and activating another path
can drive negative emotion and avoidance.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.696
I'm going to show you
a couple of examples --

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.942
a taste of raw data --

00:04:22.966 --> 00:04:26.974
of how we can use optogenetics
to target specific neurons in the brain

00:04:26.998 --> 00:04:29.798
and get very specific changes in behavior.

00:04:30.117 --> 00:04:33.475
Anxiety patients
have abnormal communication

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:35.641
between two parts of the amygdala,

00:04:35.665 --> 00:04:40.549
but in people, it's hard to know
if this abnormality is cause or effect

00:04:40.573 --> 00:04:41.723
of the disease.

00:04:42.787 --> 00:04:47.509
We can use optogenetics
to target the same pathway in a mouse,

00:04:47.533 --> 00:04:48.723
and see what happens.

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:51.546
So this is the elevated plus maze.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.348
It's a widely used anxiety test

00:04:53.372 --> 00:04:55.316
that measures the amount of time

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.070
that the mouse spends in the safety
of the closed arms

00:04:58.094 --> 00:05:00.494
relative to exploring the open arms.

00:05:01.046 --> 00:05:04.031
Mice have evolved to prefer
enclosed spaces,

00:05:04.055 --> 00:05:06.008
like the safety of their burrows,

00:05:06.032 --> 00:05:08.374
but to find food, water, mates,

00:05:08.398 --> 00:05:10.945
they need to go out into the open

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:13.529
where they're more vulnerable
to predatory threats.

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.047
So I'm sitting in the background here,

00:05:16.071 --> 00:05:18.134
and I'm about to flip the switch.

00:05:18.158 --> 00:05:20.890
And now, when I flip the switch
and turn the light on,

00:05:20.914 --> 00:05:25.355
you can see the mouse begins to explore
the open arms of the maze more.

00:05:25.843 --> 00:05:29.692
And in contrast
to drug treatments for anxiety,

00:05:29.716 --> 00:05:33.113
there's no sedation,
no locomotor impairment,

00:05:33.137 --> 00:05:36.989
just coordinated,
natural-looking exploration.

00:05:37.406 --> 00:05:40.826
So not only is the effect
almost immediate,

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.584
but there are no detectable side effects.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.819
Now, when I flip the switch off,

00:05:45.843 --> 00:05:49.652
you can see that the mouse goes back
to its normal brain function

00:05:49.676 --> 00:05:51.210
and back to its corner.

00:05:52.427 --> 00:05:56.053
When I was in the lab
and I was taking these data,

00:05:56.077 --> 00:05:58.997
I was all by myself, and I was so excited.

00:05:59.632 --> 00:06:02.029
I was so excited,
I did one of these quiet screams.

00:06:02.053 --> 00:06:03.554
(Silently) Aah!

00:06:03.578 --> 00:06:05.577
(Laughter)

00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:06.791
Why was I so excited?

00:06:06.815 --> 00:06:10.603
I mean, yeah, theoretically,
I knew that the brain controlled the mind,

00:06:10.627 --> 00:06:13.132
but to flip the switch with my hand

00:06:13.156 --> 00:06:15.452
and see the mouse
change its behavioral state

00:06:15.476 --> 00:06:17.950
so rapidly and so reversibly,

00:06:17.974 --> 00:06:21.172
it was really the first time
that I truly believed it.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.291
Since that first breakthrough,

00:06:24.315 --> 00:06:26.822
there have been a number
of other discoveries.

00:06:26.846 --> 00:06:30.377
Finding specific neural circuits
that can elicit dramatic changes

00:06:30.401 --> 00:06:31.884
in animal behavior.

00:06:32.956 --> 00:06:35.761
Here's another example:
compulsive overeating.

00:06:36.633 --> 00:06:38.625
We can eat for two reasons.

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:41.188
Seeking pleasure, like tasty food,

00:06:41.212 --> 00:06:43.736
or avoiding pain, like being hungry.

00:06:44.603 --> 00:06:48.254
How can we find a treatment
for compulsive overeating

00:06:48.278 --> 00:06:50.326
without messing up
the hunger-driven feeding

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.950
that we need to survive?

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.485
The first step is to understand

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:57.648
how the brain gives rise
to feeding behavior.

00:06:58.165 --> 00:07:02.450
This fully-fed mouse
is just exploring a space

00:07:02.474 --> 00:07:05.021
completely devoid of any food.

00:07:05.736 --> 00:07:09.268
Here we're using optogenetics to target
neurons living in the hypothalamus,

00:07:09.292 --> 00:07:13.101
sending messages down wires
aimed at the midbrain.

00:07:13.736 --> 00:07:17.117
When I turn the light on, right here,

00:07:17.141 --> 00:07:20.823
you can see that the mouse
immediately begins licking the floor.

00:07:20.847 --> 00:07:22.799
(Laughter)

00:07:25.048 --> 00:07:27.143
This seemingly frenzied behavior

00:07:27.167 --> 00:07:30.818
is about to escalate into something
I find really incredible.

00:07:31.151 --> 00:07:32.857
It's kind of trippy, actually.

00:07:33.532 --> 00:07:34.682
Ready?

00:07:35.006 --> 00:07:37.482
It's right here.

00:07:37.856 --> 00:07:41.720
See, he picks up his hands
as if he is eating a piece of food,

00:07:41.744 --> 00:07:44.245
but there's nothing there,
he's not holding anything.

00:07:44.269 --> 00:07:48.364
So this circuit is sufficient
to drive feeding behavior

00:07:48.388 --> 00:07:50.126
in the absence of hunger,

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.474
even in the absence of food.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.185
I can't know for sure
how this mouse is feeling,

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:59.274
but I speculate
these neurons drive craving

00:07:59.298 --> 00:08:03.297
based on the behaviors we elicit
when we target this pathway.

00:08:04.655 --> 00:08:06.417
Turn the light back off --

00:08:06.441 --> 00:08:08.041
animal's back to normal.

00:08:08.743 --> 00:08:11.711
When we silence this pathway,

00:08:11.735 --> 00:08:15.132
we can suppress and reduce
compulsive overeating

00:08:15.156 --> 00:08:18.028
without altering hunger-driven feeding.

00:08:20.593 --> 00:08:22.664
What did you take away
from these two videos

00:08:22.688 --> 00:08:23.936
that I just showed you?

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.912
That making a very specific change
to neural circuits in the brain

00:08:27.936 --> 00:08:30.737
can have specific changes to behavior.

00:08:30.761 --> 00:08:34.244
That every conscious
experience that we have

00:08:34.268 --> 00:08:36.534
is governed by cells in our brain.

00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:42.783
I am the daughter
of a physicist and a biologist,

00:08:42.807 --> 00:08:45.895
who literally met on the boat
coming to America

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:47.719
in pursuit of an education.

00:08:48.714 --> 00:08:49.874
So naturally,

00:08:49.898 --> 00:08:53.056
since there was "no pressure"
to be a scientist ...

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.246
(Laughter)

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.449
as a college student,

00:08:57.473 --> 00:09:02.434
I had to decide whether I wanted to focus
on psychology, the study of the mind,

00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:04.945
or neuroscience, the study of the brain.

00:09:04.969 --> 00:09:06.498
And I chose neuroscience,

00:09:06.522 --> 00:09:09.392
because I wanted to understand
how the mind is born

00:09:09.416 --> 00:09:11.272
out of biological tissue.

00:09:11.296 --> 00:09:13.883
But really, I've come
full circle to do both.

00:09:13.907 --> 00:09:15.645
And now my research program

00:09:15.669 --> 00:09:18.256
bridges the gap between
the mind and the brain.

00:09:19.315 --> 00:09:20.609
Research from my laboratory

00:09:20.633 --> 00:09:24.180
suggests that we can begin
to tie specific neural circuits

00:09:24.204 --> 00:09:26.029
to emotional states.

00:09:26.053 --> 00:09:27.897
And we have found a number of circuits

00:09:27.921 --> 00:09:30.522
that control anxiety-related behavior,

00:09:30.546 --> 00:09:32.022
compulsive overeating,

00:09:32.046 --> 00:09:34.688
social interaction, avoidance

00:09:34.712 --> 00:09:36.773
and many other types
of motivated behaviors

00:09:36.797 --> 00:09:40.208
that may reflect internal
emotional states.

00:09:41.899 --> 00:09:46.335
We used to think of functions of the mind
as being defined by brain regions.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.191
But my work shows
that within a given brain region,

00:09:49.215 --> 00:09:52.024
there are many different neurons
doing different things.

00:09:52.414 --> 00:09:56.807
And these functions
are partly defined by the paths they take.

00:09:58.033 --> 00:10:00.232
Here's a metaphor to help illustrate

00:10:00.256 --> 00:10:04.164
how these discoveries change the way
that we think about the brain.

00:10:05.069 --> 00:10:08.807
Let's say that the brain
is analogous to the world

00:10:08.831 --> 00:10:11.434
and that neurons are analogous to people.

00:10:11.458 --> 00:10:16.331
And we want to understand how information
is transmitted across the planet.

00:10:17.073 --> 00:10:18.819
Sure, it's useful to know

00:10:18.843 --> 00:10:22.017
where a given person is located
when recording what they're saying.

00:10:22.581 --> 00:10:24.719
But I would argue
that it's equally important

00:10:24.743 --> 00:10:27.664
to know who this person is talking to,

00:10:27.688 --> 00:10:29.283
who is listening

00:10:29.307 --> 00:10:33.379
and how the people listening respond
to the information that they receive.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.450
The current state
of mental health treatment

00:10:36.474 --> 00:10:39.220
is essentially a strategy
of trial and error.

00:10:40.236 --> 00:10:42.212
And it is not working.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.800
The development of new drug therapies
for mental health disorders

00:10:46.824 --> 00:10:48.149
has hit a brick wall,

00:10:48.173 --> 00:10:52.387
with scarcely any real progress
since the 1950s.

00:10:52.927 --> 00:10:54.860
So what does the future hold?

00:10:55.474 --> 00:10:56.807
In the near future,

00:10:56.831 --> 00:11:00.093
I expect to see a mental health
treatment revolution,

00:11:00.117 --> 00:11:03.291
where we focus on specific
neural circuits in the brain.

00:11:03.315 --> 00:11:07.276
Diagnoses will be made
based on both behavioral symptoms

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.300
and measurable brain activity.

00:11:10.339 --> 00:11:12.331
Further in the future,

00:11:12.355 --> 00:11:15.654
by combining our ability
to make acute changes to the brain

00:11:15.678 --> 00:11:17.704
and get acute changes to behavior

00:11:17.728 --> 00:11:22.053
with our knowledge of synaptic plasticity
to make more permanent changes,

00:11:22.077 --> 00:11:25.684
we could push the brain
into a state of fixing itself

00:11:25.708 --> 00:11:28.116
by reprogramming neural circuits.

00:11:28.927 --> 00:11:31.706
Exposure therapy at the circuit level.

00:11:33.238 --> 00:11:36.381
Once we switch the brain
into a state of self-healing,

00:11:36.405 --> 00:11:38.913
this could potentially have
long-lasting effects

00:11:38.937 --> 00:11:40.952
with no side effects.

00:11:41.831 --> 00:11:45.331
I can envision a future
where neural circuit reprogramming

00:11:45.355 --> 00:11:49.323
represents a potential cure,
not just a treatment.

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:54.701
OK, but what about right now?

00:11:55.702 --> 00:11:58.130
If from this very moment forward,

00:11:58.154 --> 00:12:00.490
each and every one of you left this talk

00:12:00.514 --> 00:12:06.149
and truly believed that the mind
comes entirely from cells in your brain,

00:12:06.173 --> 00:12:09.672
then we could immediately get rid
of negative perceptions and stigmas

00:12:09.696 --> 00:12:10.990
that prevent so many people

00:12:11.014 --> 00:12:13.585
from getting the mental health
support that they need.

00:12:13.998 --> 00:12:15.371
Mental health professionals,

00:12:15.395 --> 00:12:18.371
we're always thinking
about what's the next new treatment.

00:12:18.395 --> 00:12:20.847
But before we can apply new treatments,

00:12:20.871 --> 00:12:23.624
we need people to feel
comfortable seeking them.

00:12:24.522 --> 00:12:29.355
Imagine how dramatically
we could reduce the rates of suicides

00:12:29.379 --> 00:12:30.815
and school shootings

00:12:30.839 --> 00:12:34.680
if everyone who needed
mental health support actually got it.

00:12:36.486 --> 00:12:41.613
When we truly understand
exactly how the mind comes from the brain,

00:12:41.637 --> 00:12:43.915
we will improve the lives of everyone

00:12:43.939 --> 00:12:46.613
who will have a mental illness
in their lifetime --

00:12:46.637 --> 00:12:48.444
half the population --

00:12:48.468 --> 00:12:52.017
as well as everyone else
with whom they share the world.

00:12:53.198 --> 00:12:54.349
Thank you.

00:12:54.373 --> 00:12:58.666
(Applause)
