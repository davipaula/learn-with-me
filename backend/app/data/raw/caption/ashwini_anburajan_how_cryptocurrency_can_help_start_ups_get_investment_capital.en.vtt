00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.096
When I was raising investment
for my startup,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.216
a venture capitalist said to me,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.416
"Ashwini, I think you're going to raise
a few million dollars.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.496
And your company --
it's going to sell for 50 to 70 million.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.976
You're going to be really excited.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.496
Your early investors
are going to be really excited.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.896
And I'm going to be really upset.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.880
So I'm not going to invest in this deal."

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.000
I remember just being dumbstruck.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.176
Who would be unhappy

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.856
with putting four or five
million dollars into a company

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.680
and having it sell for 50 to 70 million?

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.976
I was a first-time founder.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.456
I didn't have a wealthy network
of individuals to turn to for investment,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.056
so I went to venture capitalists

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.440
the most common form of investor
in a technology company.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.616
But I'd never taken the time to understand

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.440
what was motivating that VC to invest.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.016
I believe we're living
in a golden era of entrepreneurship.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.240
There is more opportunity
to build companies than ever before.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.416
But the financial systems
designed to fund that innovation,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.296
venture capital,

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.056
they haven't evolved
in the past 20 to 30 years.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.976
Venture capital was designed
to pour large sums of money

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.536
into a small number of companies
that can sell for over a billion dollars.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.736
It was not designed to sprinkle capital
across many companies

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.616
that have the potential to succeed
but for less, like my own.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.096
That limits the number
of ideas that get funded,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.256
the number of companies that are created

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.456
and who can actually receive
that funding to grow.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.136
And I think it inspires a tough question:

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.256
What's our goal with entrepreneurship?

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.816
If our goal is to create a tiny number
of billion-dollar companies,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.736
let's stick with venture
capital, it's working.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.696
But if our goal is to inspire innovation

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.696
and empower more people
to build companies of all sizes,

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.776
we need a new way to fund those ideas.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.736
We need a more flexible system

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.416
that doesn't squeeze
entrepreneurs and investors

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.040
into one rigid financial outcome.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.800
We need to democratize access to capital.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.056
In the summer of 2017,
I went out to San Francisco,

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.376
to join a tech accelerator
with 30 other companies.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.616
The accelerator was supposed to teach us
how to raise venture capital.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.096
But when I got out there,

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.896
the startup community was buzzing
about ICOs, or Initial Coin Offerings.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.896
For the first time, ICOs had raised
more money for young startups

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.600
than venture capital had.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.416
It was the first week of the program.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.016
Tequila Friday.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.056
And the founders couldn't stop talking.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.496
"I'm going to raise an ICO."

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.056
"I'm going to raise an ICO."

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.696
Until one guy goes,

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.536
"How cool if we did this all together?

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.136
We should do an ICO that combines
the value of all of our companies

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.296
and raise money as a group."

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.656
At that point, I had to ask
the obvious question,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.296
"Guys, what's an ICO?"

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.296
ICOs were a way for young
companies to raise money

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.776
by issuing a digital currency

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.096
tied to the value and services
that the company provides.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.616
The currency acts similar
to shares in a company,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.576
like on the public stock market,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.400
increasing in value as it's traded online.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.736
Most important,
ICOs expanded the investor pool,

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.176
from a few hundred venture capital firms

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.480
to millions of everyday people,
excited to invest.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.096
This market represented more money.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.296
It represented more investors.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.760
Which meant a greater
likelihood to get funded.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.960
I was sold.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.256
The idea, though, of doing it together
still seemed a little crazy.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.816
Startups compete
with each other for investment,

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.640
it takes hundreds of meetings
to get a check.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.495
That I would spend my precious 15 minutes
in front of an investor

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:33.536
talking not just about my own company,
but all the companies in the batch,

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.760
was unprecedented.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.496
But the idea caught on.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.800
And we decided to cooperate,
rather than compete.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.376
Every company put 10 percent
of their equity into a communal pool

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.536
that we then split
into tradable cryptocurrency

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.240
that investors could buy and sell.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.976
Six months and four law firms later --

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.656
(Laughter)

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.816
in January 2018,
we launched the very first ICO

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.176
that represented the value
of nearly 30 companies

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.160
and an entirely new way to raise capital.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.976
We got a lot of press.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.176
My favorite headline about us read,

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.456
"VCs, read this and weep."

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.176
(Laughter)

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.256
Our fund was naturally more diverse.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.496
Twenty percent of the founders were women.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.896
Fifty percent were international.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.496
The investors were more excited, too.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.456
They had a chance to get better returns,

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.296
because we took out
the middleman fees of venture capital.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.296
And they could take their money
and reinvest it,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.240
potentially funding more new ideas faster.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.776
I believe this creates
a virtuous cycle of capital

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.536
that allows many more
entrepreneurs to succeed.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.096
Because access to capital
is access to opportunity.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.096
And we have only just begun to imagine

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.200
what democratizing
access to capital will do.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.056
I would have never thought
that my own search for funding

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.896
would lead me to this stage,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.520
having helped nearly
30 companies get investment.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.536
Imagine if other entrepreneurs tried
to invent new ways to access capital

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.296
rather than following
the traditional route.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.376
It would change
what gets built, who builds it

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.176
and the long-term impact on the economy.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.136
And I believe that's way more exciting

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.096
than just trying to invest
in the next billion-dollar startup.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.336
Thank you.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.080
(Applause)
