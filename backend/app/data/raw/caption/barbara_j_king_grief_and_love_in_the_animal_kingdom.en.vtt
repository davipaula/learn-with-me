00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.742
I'd like to tell you today
about an orca named Tahlequah.

00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:21.234
Tahlequah is also known
as J35 to scientists,

00:00:21.258 --> 00:00:24.661
because she swims with the J Pod
in the Salish Sea.

00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:28.424
These are the waters off of
British Columbia and Washington State.

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:32.151
Now, last year, in July 2018,

00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:36.391
she was well along
in her 17-month pregnancy,

00:00:36.415 --> 00:00:38.406
and scientists were very excited

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.615
because no baby had survived
in this pod for three long years.

00:00:44.464 --> 00:00:47.431
Now, orcas are also
known as killer whales.

00:00:47.455 --> 00:00:51.681
They're profoundly social
and profoundly intelligent beings.

00:00:52.354 --> 00:00:55.834
And scientists are very interested
in their behavior,

00:00:55.858 --> 00:00:59.636
because in their social networks,
they share habits, information

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.858
and even affection.

00:01:00.882 --> 00:01:04.068
They create true cultures of the ocean.

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.401
But this pod has been in trouble.

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:12.723
The Chinook salmon that the orcas favor
has been way down in the region,

00:01:12.747 --> 00:01:14.529
and pollution has been up.

00:01:15.344 --> 00:01:20.730
But on July 24th, Tahlequah
gave birth to a daughter,

00:01:20.754 --> 00:01:24.259
and scientists were so excited
by this development.

00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:28.666
But unfortunately, the same day --
in fact, shortly after birth --

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:29.972
the calf died.

00:01:31.077 --> 00:01:34.122
Well, what happened next
electrified animal lovers

00:01:34.146 --> 00:01:35.794
across the world,

00:01:35.818 --> 00:01:40.429
because Tahlequah refused
to let her baby slip off into the water.

00:01:40.453 --> 00:01:43.721
She kept it on her body
and she swam with it.

00:01:43.745 --> 00:01:47.878
If it did fall off,
she would dive and rescue it,

00:01:47.902 --> 00:01:50.782
and she battled stiff currents to do this.

00:01:51.218 --> 00:01:53.371
Now, she kept this behavior up

00:01:53.395 --> 00:01:56.092
for 17 days,

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:59.494
and during this time,
she swam over 1,000 miles.

00:02:00.024 --> 00:02:03.964
At that point, she let the little baby
slip off into the water.

00:02:04.876 --> 00:02:09.255
So today, Tahlequah
swims on with the J Pod,

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:12.573
but her grief still moves me.

00:02:12.597 --> 00:02:16.176
And I do believe that "grief"
is the right word to use.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.810
I believe that grief
is the right word to use

00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:21.774
for numerous animals who mourn the dead.

00:02:21.798 --> 00:02:24.734
They may be friends or mates or relatives.

00:02:25.127 --> 00:02:28.449
Because these visible cues,
these behavioral cues,

00:02:28.473 --> 00:02:31.739
tell us something about
an animal's emotional state.

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:34.045
Now, for the last seven years,

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.713
I've been working to document
examples of animal grief --

00:02:37.737 --> 00:02:39.875
in birds, in mammals,

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:42.875
in domesticated animals
and in wild animals --

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:45.882
and I believe in the reality
of animal grief.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.423
Now, I say it this way

00:02:48.447 --> 00:02:50.882
because I need to acknowledge
to you right up front

00:02:50.906 --> 00:02:52.881
that not all scientists agree with me.

00:02:53.287 --> 00:02:55.440
And part of the reason, I think,

00:02:55.464 --> 00:02:58.095
is because of what I call the "a-word."

00:02:58.592 --> 00:03:00.351
The a-word is anthropomorphism,

00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:02.376
and historically,
it's been a big deterrent

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.652
to recognizing animal emotions.

00:03:05.095 --> 00:03:09.295
So, anthropomorphism is when
we project onto other animals

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.123
our capacities or our emotions.

00:03:12.634 --> 00:03:16.169
And we can all probably
think of examples of this.

00:03:16.193 --> 00:03:18.541
Let's say we have a friend who tells us,

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:21.748
"My cat understands everything I say."

00:03:22.355 --> 00:03:25.171
Or, "My dog, he's so sweet.

00:03:25.195 --> 00:03:28.133
he ran right across the yard this morning
towards a squirrel,

00:03:28.157 --> 00:03:29.856
and I know he just wants to play."

00:03:30.435 --> 00:03:31.981
Well, maybe.

00:03:32.744 --> 00:03:33.909
Or maybe not.

00:03:33.933 --> 00:03:36.251
I'm skeptical about claims like those.

00:03:37.202 --> 00:03:39.197
But animal grief is different,

00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:42.087
because we're not trying
to read an animal's mind.

00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:44.514
We're looking at visible cues of behavior

00:03:44.538 --> 00:03:46.935
and trying to interpret them
with some meaning.

00:03:47.406 --> 00:03:50.289
Now, it's true -- scientists
often push back at me,

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:51.465
and they'll say,

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.733
"Ah, look, the animal might be stressed,

00:03:53.757 --> 00:03:55.534
or maybe the animal's just confused

00:03:55.558 --> 00:03:58.202
because his or her routine
has been disrupted."

00:03:58.935 --> 00:04:03.277
But I think that this overworry
about anthropomorphism

00:04:03.301 --> 00:04:05.804
misses a fundamental point.

00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:09.635
And that is that animals
can care very deeply for each other,

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.352
maybe they even love each other.

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:12.739
And when they do,

00:04:12.763 --> 00:04:16.296
a survivor's heart
can be pierced by a death.

00:04:17.013 --> 00:04:18.250
Let's face it:

00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:21.083
if we deny evolutionary continuity,

00:04:21.107 --> 00:04:24.827
we are really missing out
on embracing part of ourselves.

00:04:25.603 --> 00:04:28.270
So yes, I believe in the reality
of animal grief,

00:04:28.294 --> 00:04:30.773
and I also think that if we recognize it,

00:04:30.797 --> 00:04:33.443
we can make the world
a better place for animals,

00:04:33.467 --> 00:04:35.630
a kinder place for animals.

00:04:36.362 --> 00:04:39.464
So let me tell you a little bit more
about animal grief.

00:04:40.341 --> 00:04:42.559
I'm going to start in Kenya.

00:04:43.027 --> 00:04:45.955
You see here there's
an elephant named Eleanor

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.957
who came one day with bruised legs,

00:04:48.981 --> 00:04:50.862
and she collapsed.

00:04:50.886 --> 00:04:52.083
You see on the left

00:04:52.107 --> 00:04:55.844
that another female named Grace
came to her right away

00:04:55.868 --> 00:04:58.371
and, using her own trunk, propped her up,

00:04:58.395 --> 00:05:00.183
tried to get her up on her feet.

00:05:00.207 --> 00:05:01.402
And she did succeed,

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:03.684
but then Eleanor collapsed again.

00:05:04.236 --> 00:05:07.610
At this point, Grace became
visibly distressed,

00:05:07.634 --> 00:05:10.893
and she prodded the body,
and she vocalized.

00:05:11.906 --> 00:05:13.297
Eleanor collapsed again,

00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:15.593
and unfortunately, she did die.

00:05:16.036 --> 00:05:20.681
What you see on the right is a female
from another family named Maui,

00:05:20.705 --> 00:05:23.578
who came after the death,
and she stayed at the body.

00:05:23.602 --> 00:05:27.014
She held a vigil there,
and she even rocked in distress

00:05:27.038 --> 00:05:28.640
over the body.

00:05:28.664 --> 00:05:31.167
So the scientists watching the elephants

00:05:31.191 --> 00:05:34.655
kept close observation on Eleanor's body

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:36.284
for seven days.

00:05:36.308 --> 00:05:37.794
And during those seven days,

00:05:37.818 --> 00:05:39.869
a parade of elephants came

00:05:39.893 --> 00:05:41.823
from five different families.

00:05:42.266 --> 00:05:44.191
Now, some were just curious,

00:05:44.215 --> 00:05:45.757
but others carried out behaviors

00:05:45.781 --> 00:05:49.220
that I really believe
should be classified as grief.

00:05:50.447 --> 00:05:52.252
So what does grief look like?

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.892
It can be rocking, as I said, in distress.

00:05:55.916 --> 00:05:57.826
It can also be social withdrawal,

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.895
when an animal just takes
himself or herself away from friends

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.506
and stays by themselves,

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.141
or a failure to eat or sleep properly,

00:06:07.165 --> 00:06:10.597
sometimes a depressed posture
or vocalization.

00:06:11.311 --> 00:06:14.205
It can be very helpful
for those of us studying this

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:18.583
to be able to compare the behavior
of a survivor before death

00:06:18.607 --> 00:06:19.828
and after death,

00:06:19.852 --> 00:06:23.166
because that increases the rigor
of our interpretation.

00:06:23.722 --> 00:06:25.126
And I can explain this to you

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.596
by talking about two ducks
named Harper and Kohl.

00:06:30.217 --> 00:06:31.848
So we're into birds now.

00:06:32.403 --> 00:06:35.621
So Harper and Kohl were raised
at a foie gras factory,

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:37.586
and they were treated cruelly.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.518
Foie gras does involve
force-feeding of birds.

00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:44.638
So this hurt their bodies, and their
spirits were not in good shape, either.

00:06:44.662 --> 00:06:49.324
But thankfully, they were rescued
by a farm sanctuary in upstate New York.

00:06:49.348 --> 00:06:53.063
And for four years, they stabilized,
and they were fast friends.

00:06:53.087 --> 00:06:56.574
They often took themselves
to a small pond on the property.

00:06:57.711 --> 00:07:01.761
Then, Kohl started to have
really intractable pain in his legs,

00:07:01.785 --> 00:07:05.864
and it was clear to the sanctuary
that he had to be euthanized humanely,

00:07:05.888 --> 00:07:07.317
and he was.

00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:09.928
But then the sanctuary workers
did a brilliant thing,

00:07:09.952 --> 00:07:13.574
because they brought Harper
to the body to see.

00:07:14.015 --> 00:07:17.050
And at first, Harper prodded
the body of his friend,

00:07:17.074 --> 00:07:20.303
but then he laid himself over it,

00:07:20.327 --> 00:07:23.359
and he stayed there
for over an hour with his friend.

00:07:23.996 --> 00:07:26.937
And in the weeks after,

00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:28.657
he had a hard time.

00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:31.829
He would go back to that same pond
where he had been with Kohl,

00:07:31.853 --> 00:07:33.968
and he didn't want any other friends.

00:07:34.536 --> 00:07:37.070
And within two months, he died as well.

00:07:38.307 --> 00:07:39.613
Now, I'm happy to say

00:07:39.637 --> 00:07:43.458
that not all grieving animals
have this sorrowful outcome.

00:07:43.482 --> 00:07:47.906
Last summer, I flew to Boston
to visit my adult daughter, Sarah.

00:07:48.375 --> 00:07:49.888
I was with my husband Charlie.

00:07:49.912 --> 00:07:52.722
I really needed a break from work.

00:07:53.508 --> 00:07:56.982
But I succumbed,
and I checked my work email.

00:07:57.006 --> 00:07:58.163
You know how that is.

00:07:58.187 --> 00:08:02.508
And there was a communication
about a dejected donkey.

00:08:03.153 --> 00:08:05.848
Now, as an anthropologist,
this wasn't what I expected,

00:08:05.872 --> 00:08:07.900
but there it was, and I'm glad I read it.

00:08:07.924 --> 00:08:12.086
Because a donkey named Lena
had gone to another farm sanctuary,

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.304
this one in Alberta, Canada,

00:08:14.328 --> 00:08:16.372
as the only donkey there,

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.840
and had trouble making friends
for that reason.

00:08:19.864 --> 00:08:23.067
But she eventually did make friends
with an older horse named Jake,

00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:26.085
and for three years they were inseparable.

00:08:26.109 --> 00:08:29.983
But the reason the email came
was that Jake, at age 32, the horse,

00:08:30.007 --> 00:08:33.322
had become gravely ill
and had to be put down,

00:08:33.765 --> 00:08:36.828
and this is what was going on.

00:08:36.852 --> 00:08:39.423
This is Lena standing on Jake's grave.

00:08:39.447 --> 00:08:42.923
She didn't want to come in at night.
She didn't want to come in for food.

00:08:42.947 --> 00:08:44.802
She didn't want to come in for water.

00:08:44.826 --> 00:08:47.811
She pawed at the grave,
she brayed in distress,

00:08:47.835 --> 00:08:49.517
and there she stood.

00:08:50.292 --> 00:08:52.770
So we talked and we brainstormed.

00:08:52.794 --> 00:08:55.156
What do you do for an animal like this?

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.495
And we talked about the role of time,

00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:00.186
of extra love and kindness from people

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.024
and of urging her to make a new friend.

00:09:03.048 --> 00:09:07.773
And here's where her trajectory does
diverge from that of Harper the duck,

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:09.698
because she did make a new friend,

00:09:09.722 --> 00:09:12.702
and sanctuary workers wrote back
and said it worked out well.

00:09:14.052 --> 00:09:17.477
Now sometimes, scientists
supplement observation

00:09:17.501 --> 00:09:19.381
with hormonal analysis.

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:22.807
There's an example of a group
of scientists in Botswana,

00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:27.380
who took fecal material from baboons
and compared two different groups.

00:09:27.404 --> 00:09:31.512
The first group were females
who had witnessed a predator attack

00:09:31.536 --> 00:09:34.025
and lost someone in that attack,

00:09:34.049 --> 00:09:36.908
and the second group were females
who had witnessed an attack

00:09:36.932 --> 00:09:38.721
but had not lost someone.

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:41.484
And the stress hormones
were way up in that first group.

00:09:41.895 --> 00:09:43.137
But here's the thing:

00:09:43.161 --> 00:09:45.900
the scientists didn't just
call them "stressed baboons,"

00:09:45.924 --> 00:09:48.151
they called them "bereaved baboons,"

00:09:48.175 --> 00:09:52.160
and in part, that's because
of the observations that they made.

00:09:52.184 --> 00:09:55.154
For example, this mother-daughter
pair were very close,

00:09:55.178 --> 00:09:57.398
and then the daughter
was killed by a lion.

00:09:58.118 --> 00:10:00.804
The mother removed herself
from all her friends,

00:10:00.828 --> 00:10:04.451
from her grooming networks,
and just stayed by herself for weeks --

00:10:05.298 --> 00:10:06.726
bereavement --

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.474
and she then slowly recovered.

00:10:11.055 --> 00:10:13.517
So we have bereaved baboons.

00:10:13.918 --> 00:10:17.728
Will science tell us someday
about bereaved bees?

00:10:17.752 --> 00:10:20.815
Will we hear about frogs who mourn?

00:10:21.443 --> 00:10:25.003
I don't think so, and I think the reason
is because animals really need

00:10:25.027 --> 00:10:28.216
one-to-one, close relationships
for that to happen.

00:10:28.763 --> 00:10:33.365
I also know that circumstance matters,
and personality matters.

00:10:33.389 --> 00:10:36.127
I have documented
cats and dogs who grieve,

00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:37.981
our companion animals,

00:10:38.005 --> 00:10:40.904
but I also interacted with a woman
who was extremely bothered

00:10:40.928 --> 00:10:43.151
because her dog wasn't grieving.

00:10:43.888 --> 00:10:47.051
She said to me, "The first dog
in the house has died.

00:10:47.075 --> 00:10:50.133
The second animal does not
seem concerned, the second dog.

00:10:50.157 --> 00:10:51.870
What is wrong with him?"

00:10:51.894 --> 00:10:53.342
(Laughter)

00:10:53.366 --> 00:10:55.392
And as I listened to her,

00:10:55.416 --> 00:10:59.115
I realized that this dog was now
the only animal in the household,

00:10:59.139 --> 00:11:02.318
and as far as he was concerned,
that was a pretty good deal.

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:05.368
So circumstances matter.

00:11:06.716 --> 00:11:09.382
Now, in any case, animals
are not going to grieve

00:11:09.406 --> 00:11:11.255
exactly like we do.

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:13.036
We have human creativity.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:16.713
We paint our grief, dance our grief,

00:11:16.737 --> 00:11:18.538
write our grief.

00:11:18.562 --> 00:11:21.435
We also can grieve for people
we've never met,

00:11:21.459 --> 00:11:23.506
across space and time.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.191
I felt this strongly when I went to Berlin

00:11:26.215 --> 00:11:28.741
and I stood at the Holocaust Memorial.

00:11:29.428 --> 00:11:31.740
Animals don't grieve exactly like we do,

00:11:31.764 --> 00:11:34.516
but this doesn't mean
that their grief isn't real.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.657
It is real, and it's searing,

00:11:37.681 --> 00:11:40.082
and we can see it if we choose.

00:11:41.495 --> 00:11:43.911
Now, I've lost both my parents.

00:11:43.935 --> 00:11:47.609
I lost a very dear friend
at a young age from AIDS.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.934
I believe most likely most of you
here have lost someone.

00:11:52.958 --> 00:11:56.044
And I have found it a genuine comfort,

00:11:56.068 --> 00:12:00.806
a solace, to know that we aren't
the only beings on this earth

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.251
who feel love and grief.

00:12:04.058 --> 00:12:05.635
And I think this is important.

00:12:06.173 --> 00:12:08.586
I also think we can take
this a step further,

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:11.374
and we can realize
that the reality of animal grief

00:12:11.398 --> 00:12:15.271
can help us be better
and do better for animals.

00:12:15.295 --> 00:12:17.798
This is already happening with Tahlequah,

00:12:17.822 --> 00:12:22.933
because the United States and Canada have
renewed their talks with greater urgency

00:12:22.957 --> 00:12:24.481
for how to help the orcas,

00:12:24.505 --> 00:12:26.558
how to restore the Chinook salmon

00:12:26.582 --> 00:12:28.610
and how to help with the water pollution.

00:12:29.057 --> 00:12:31.785
We can also see that if grief is real,

00:12:31.809 --> 00:12:34.359
there's tremendous
plausibility to the notion

00:12:34.383 --> 00:12:37.347
that animals feel a whole range of things.

00:12:37.868 --> 00:12:41.784
So we could look at joy,
sadness, even hope.

00:12:42.292 --> 00:12:44.224
And if we do that,

00:12:44.248 --> 00:12:46.535
here's how we can start
to think about the world.

00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:48.938
We can look at orcas and say,

00:12:48.962 --> 00:12:51.668
we know they grieve,
we know they feel their lives,

00:12:51.692 --> 00:12:57.109
and we can refuse to confine them
to small tanks in theme parks

00:12:57.133 --> 00:13:00.312
and make them perform
for our entertainment.

00:13:00.336 --> 00:13:02.495
(Applause)

00:13:02.519 --> 00:13:04.809
Thank you.

00:13:04.833 --> 00:13:07.884
We can look at elephants
and say, yes, they grieve,

00:13:07.908 --> 00:13:11.652
and we can renew our efforts
against international trophy hunting

00:13:11.676 --> 00:13:13.215
and against poaching.

00:13:13.239 --> 00:13:15.277
(Applause)

00:13:15.301 --> 00:13:16.855
Thank you.

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:20.295
And we can look at our closest
living relatives, monkeys and apes,

00:13:20.319 --> 00:13:23.285
and know yes they grieve,
they feel their lives,

00:13:23.309 --> 00:13:25.806
so they don't deserve to be confined

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:29.139
in highly invasive biomedical experiments

00:13:29.163 --> 00:13:30.774
year after year.

00:13:31.393 --> 00:13:32.546
And, you know --

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:33.808
(Applause)

00:13:33.832 --> 00:13:37.310
the ducks Harper and Kohl,
they tell us something too.

00:13:37.334 --> 00:13:40.980
They help us connect the dots
and realize that what we eat

00:13:41.004 --> 00:13:43.246
affects how animals live.

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:46.766
And it's not just foie gras,
and it's not just ducks.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:52.234
We can think about pigs and chickens
and cows in factory farms,

00:13:52.258 --> 00:13:53.416
and we can know.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.388
I can tell you the science is real
that these animals feel, too.

00:13:57.412 --> 00:14:01.932
So every single time
we choose a plant-based meal,

00:14:01.956 --> 00:14:05.693
we are contributing
to reducing animal suffering.

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:09.270
(Applause)

00:14:09.294 --> 00:14:13.929
So yes, I believe in the reality
of animal grief.

00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:16.138
I believe in the reality of animal love,

00:14:16.162 --> 00:14:18.672
and I think it is time for us humans

00:14:18.696 --> 00:14:21.369
to recognize that
we don't own these things.

00:14:21.836 --> 00:14:23.366
And when we see that,

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:27.204
we have an opportunity to make the world
so much better for animals,

00:14:27.228 --> 00:14:29.531
a kinder world, a gentler world,

00:14:29.555 --> 00:14:34.052
and along the way, we might
just save ourselves, too.

00:14:34.076 --> 00:14:35.568
Thank you so much.

00:14:35.592 --> 00:14:37.193
(Applause)

00:14:37.217 --> 00:14:38.980
Thank you. Thank you.

00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:40.833
(Applause)
