00:00:07.761 --> 00:00:11.079
If you ever find yourself 
gazing at falling snow,

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:15.342
why not catch a few snowflakes 
on your glove and examine their shapes?

00:00:15.342 --> 00:00:17.438
You might notice 
that they look symmetrical,

00:00:17.438 --> 00:00:18.783
and if you look closely,

00:00:18.783 --> 00:00:21.124
you'll see they have six sides.

00:00:21.124 --> 00:00:24.217
You could say a snowflake 
is simply frozen water,

00:00:24.217 --> 00:00:26.873
but compare one 
with an ice cube from the freezer,

00:00:26.873 --> 00:00:29.802
and you'll realize 
they're very different things.

00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:34.007
Unlike ice cubes, formed when liquid
freezes into a solid,

00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:38.691
snowflakes form when water vapor
turns straight into ice.

00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:42.420
But that still doesn't explain why
snowflakes have six sides.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.128
To understand that,

00:00:44.128 --> 00:00:47.756
we need to delve deeper 
into the physics of water.

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:52.349
Water is made out of two hydrogen atoms
and one oxygen atom.

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:57.512
A single water molecule 
thus has ten protons and ten electrons,

00:00:57.512 --> 00:01:00.948
eight from oxygen 
and one from each hydrogen atom.

00:01:00.948 --> 00:01:03.350
The two electrons 
from oxygen's outer shell

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.549
are shared with two electrons
from both hydrogens as they bond together,

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.728
and the remaining 
four outer shell electrons from oxygen

00:01:11.728 --> 00:01:13.844
form two pairs.

00:01:13.844 --> 00:01:17.863
We call the bonds between these atoms
covalent bonds.

00:01:17.863 --> 00:01:20.812
The pairs of electrons 
are all negatively charged.

00:01:20.812 --> 00:01:22.644
Similar charges repel,

00:01:22.644 --> 00:01:26.719
so they tend to stay as far away
from each other as possible.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.358
The pairs form four electron clouds,

00:01:29.358 --> 00:01:33.919
two of which are where the hydrogen
and oxygen share electrons.

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:36.228
The repulsion between the unbonded pairs

00:01:36.228 --> 00:01:39.817
is even stronger than repulsion
between the shared pairs,

00:01:39.817 --> 00:01:43.186
so the two hydrogens 
get pushed a little further

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:47.204
to an angle of 104.5 degrees.

00:01:47.204 --> 00:01:50.447
The water molecule as a whole
is electrically neutral,

00:01:50.447 --> 00:01:53.266
but oxygen gets 
a larger share of electrons,

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:57.860
making it slightly negative
and the hydrogens slightly positive.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.302
Due to its negative charge,

00:01:59.302 --> 00:02:01.292
the oxygen in one molecule

00:02:01.292 --> 00:02:06.427
is attracted to the positive charge
of the hydrogen in another molecule.

00:02:06.427 --> 00:02:08.957
And so a weak bond 
between the two molecules,

00:02:08.957 --> 00:02:11.551
called a hydrogen bond,
is formed.

00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:15.629
When water freezes, this bonding
occurs on repeat,

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.978
ultimately forming a hexagonal structure

00:02:17.978 --> 00:02:22.865
due to the angle between hydrogens
and oxygen within each molecule.

00:02:22.865 --> 00:02:25.493
This is the seed of a snowflake,

00:02:25.493 --> 00:02:28.709
and it retains a hexagonal shape
as it grows.

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.801
As the snowflake moves through the air,

00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:35.126
water vapor molecules 
stick to the six sharp edges

00:02:35.126 --> 00:02:39.234
and expand the snowflake outwards,
bit by bit.

00:02:39.234 --> 00:02:43.094
A snowflake's developing shape depends
on atmospheric conditions,

00:02:43.094 --> 00:02:45.732
like humidity and temperature.

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:47.105
As a snowflake falls,

00:02:47.105 --> 00:02:50.565
changes in weather conditions
can affect how it grows,

00:02:50.565 --> 00:02:54.463
and even small differences in the paths
two snowflakes take

00:02:54.463 --> 00:02:56.858
will differentiate their shapes.

00:02:56.858 --> 00:03:01.706
However, since conditions at the six 
sharp edges of one snowflake are similar,

00:03:01.706 --> 00:03:04.437
a symmetric snowflake can grow.

00:03:04.437 --> 00:03:07.552
Weather conditions 
affect snow on the ground, as well.

00:03:07.552 --> 00:03:12.047
Warmer ground temperatures produce
a wetter snow that is easier to pack

00:03:12.047 --> 00:03:16.796
because liquid water molecules
help snowflakes stick to each other.

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:22.648
Melted snow also plays a critical role
in another wintry activity, skiing.

00:03:22.648 --> 00:03:26.206
Completely dry snow 
is very difficult to ski on

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:31.338
because there's too much friction between
the jagged snowflakes and the ski surface.

00:03:31.338 --> 00:03:33.974
So what's happening is that as skis move,

00:03:33.974 --> 00:03:37.504
they rub the surface of the snow
and warm it up,

00:03:37.504 --> 00:03:41.521
creating a thin layer of water,
which helps them slide along.

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:44.534
So technically, 
it's not really snow skiing,

00:03:44.534 --> 00:03:46.784
but water skiing.

00:03:46.784 --> 00:03:49.416
But it is true that 
no matter how hard you look,

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:54.065
you're almost definitely not going to find
two identical snowflakes,

00:03:54.065 --> 00:03:57.761
and that's a mystery that scientists
are still trying to solve,

00:03:57.761 --> 00:03:59.337
though we know that it has to do

00:03:59.337 --> 00:04:03.251
with the many possible 
branching points in snowflake formation,

00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:06.195
and the differences 
in temperature and humidity,

00:04:06.195 --> 00:04:08.054
and while we wait for the answer,

00:04:08.054 --> 00:04:13.120
we can enjoy watching these tiny fractals
falling from the sky.
