00:00:14.526 --> 00:00:18.007
So, today, I want to start by going back,

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.629
to be specific, about 2,000 years.

00:00:21.956 --> 00:00:24.286
Now, I want you to picture ancient Rome.

00:00:24.985 --> 00:00:26.411
What images come to mind?

00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:30.201
The gladiators, Colosseum, Julius Caesar?

00:00:30.221 --> 00:00:33.625
Or maybe armies wearing scale mail,
perhaps a bit like this.

00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:39.686
Now, I want to change your focus
to a modern-day oncology unit,

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:44.224
specifically women who are undergoing
radiotherapy breast cancer treatment.

00:00:44.718 --> 00:00:46.292
Can you see a connection?

00:00:47.337 --> 00:00:49.725
Now, there's nothing obvious;
I can grant you that,

00:00:49.743 --> 00:00:54.048
but today I would like to talk to you
about two of my major science projects,

00:00:54.048 --> 00:00:57.006
both of which were inspired by the past:

00:00:57.244 --> 00:01:00.576
scale mail and ancient
Egyptian water clocks,

00:01:00.602 --> 00:01:03.550
to help solve two very different problems.

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:07.635
I'm 16 years old, and I love
science and engineering,

00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:09.994
in case you hadn't guessed
from the T-shirt.

00:01:11.568 --> 00:01:14.887
As a scientist, I am,
along with so many others,

00:01:14.887 --> 00:01:18.014
constantly thinking about
where we'll be in five years,

00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:20.663
in 10 years, even in 50 years' time,

00:01:21.092 --> 00:01:25.059
the question which constantly drives
our curiosity and our imagination

00:01:25.076 --> 00:01:28.602
to help solve global problems
with simple answers.

00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:31.327
Whether this be clean energy or health,

00:01:31.347 --> 00:01:34.818
there are major concerns
facing our planet today.

00:01:35.532 --> 00:01:38.640
Now, not only is our generation
going to inherit these problems,

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.685
but we're also creating
new ones for ourselves.

00:01:42.072 --> 00:01:46.523
But I believe that when it comes
to coming up with solutions,

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:47.693
we can look to the past.

00:01:47.703 --> 00:01:50.663
We can use the past to change the future,

00:01:50.683 --> 00:01:53.383
taking things that have been used before

00:01:53.403 --> 00:01:55.960
and repurposing them in a different way.

00:01:57.234 --> 00:01:59.709
Now, if you've ever gone
to the dentist for an X-ray,

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.434
you'll be familiar with this scene:

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:03.211
the dentist comes into the room,

00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:05.740
they place a lead apron
over the top of you

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.814
whilst they quickly jump out,
and you get your X-ray.

00:02:09.407 --> 00:02:12.145
Well, this is a similar type shield
that might be used

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:15.614
if you're undergoing radiotherapy
breast cancer treatment,

00:02:15.634 --> 00:02:17.660
but it isn't failsafe.

00:02:17.927 --> 00:02:19.893
The lead that they use is toxic,

00:02:19.913 --> 00:02:21.770
it costs a lot of money,

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.787
and it costs a lot of time
for the centers,

00:02:23.807 --> 00:02:26.698
which is why they tend
to opt out of this decision.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.309
However, this means that the women
who are undergoing this treatment

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.889
will receive harmful unwanted radiation
to their contralateral breast,

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.276
which is just a fancy word
for the breast that's not being treated,

00:02:39.296 --> 00:02:43.067
and this is an unwanted byproduct
of being free of cancer.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.588
Studies have shown that one in 14 women
who undergo this treatment

00:02:48.608 --> 00:02:54.098
will develop a second primary cancer
in this breast later in their lifetime,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.739
which is where my idea
for scale mail comes in,

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.321
something which I've learned about
in movies and museums.

00:03:00.651 --> 00:03:03.336
Could this ancient shielding technique

00:03:03.356 --> 00:03:05.779
be more effective
than what we're using today?

00:03:06.834 --> 00:03:10.370
Now, some early forms of scale mail
were documented by the Chinese,

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.161
who used them to protect
their horses during battle.

00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:16.583
The Japanese samurai
used to beat individual leaves,

00:03:16.603 --> 00:03:18.753
replicating that of fish scales,

00:03:18.773 --> 00:03:21.271
[which] was also found
in Roman and Persian armies

00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:24.931
and is also found on this very cute
animal called the pangolin,

00:03:24.951 --> 00:03:27.714
which is very effective for protection.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.723
So this is my device
called the SMART armor,

00:03:31.743 --> 00:03:35.400
which stands for "Scale Mail Armor
for Radiation Therapy."

00:03:36.113 --> 00:03:37.664
So I made this

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:43.430
by meticulously and painfully interweaving
these individual scales together,

00:03:43.466 --> 00:03:47.660
using pliers and jump rings
for what felt like an eternity.

00:03:48.543 --> 00:03:50.715
So, to test my device,

00:03:50.735 --> 00:03:54.880
I used what we would consider
a typical breast cancer treatment.

00:03:55.078 --> 00:03:57.068
And this was found

00:03:57.088 --> 00:04:02.301
that I could reduce doses
to the contralateral breast by up to 80%,

00:04:02.682 --> 00:04:07.657
reducing the radiation levels
to this breast by 80%.

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:12.370
Now, what makes this device different,
which you may have already noticed,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.329
is not only the use of scale mail,
but also the use of copper.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.884
Now, I found that copper
was 20% more effective

00:04:20.884 --> 00:04:22.514
at the skin level than lead,

00:04:22.994 --> 00:04:25.635
something that contradicts
global standards

00:04:25.655 --> 00:04:27.499
that we should be using lead.

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:33.160
Now, I've performed all of my testing
at the Chris O'Brien Lifehouse,

00:04:33.182 --> 00:04:37.042
and I'm overwhelmed and absolutely
ecstatic at the response.

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:42.745
It has approval from the Therapeutic
Goods Administration of Australia,

00:04:42.765 --> 00:04:45.029
which means that it's ready
for clinical use.

00:04:45.613 --> 00:04:47.238
I have a provisional patent on it,

00:04:47.258 --> 00:04:49.809
so don't go thinking you can steal it.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.444
And my paper is soon to be published
in the Journal of Applied Medical Physics,

00:04:54.464 --> 00:04:56.643
which is based in North America.

00:04:57.605 --> 00:05:00.525
Now, there's still, of course,
a lot of work to be done,

00:05:00.545 --> 00:05:03.491
but through experimentation,
through curiosity,

00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:05.992
and a bit of imagination,

00:05:06.012 --> 00:05:08.971
this just shows how an ancient technology

00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:12.509
can be refocused for future
scientific breakthrough.

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:17.062
The ancient curving,
conforming nature of this material

00:05:17.082 --> 00:05:21.434
made it ideal for its new purpose,
potentially saving lives.

00:05:22.876 --> 00:05:25.894
Now, I'd like to change
your focus a bit to a problem

00:05:25.904 --> 00:05:28.194
where I've also focused my thinking:

00:05:28.214 --> 00:05:29.585
solar panels,

00:05:29.605 --> 00:05:32.513
which are expensive to buy,
difficult to install,

00:05:32.533 --> 00:05:35.329
and thus become almost impractical

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:39.195
when helping to solve the developing
world's great energy crisis.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.233
Many millions of dollars and thousands
of researchers across the world

00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:48.727
are looking to improve solar panel
efficiency by one or two percent.

00:05:49.645 --> 00:05:55.683
I discovered that I could improve
a solar panel's power output by up to 72%

00:05:55.713 --> 00:05:57.116
through the combination

00:05:57.136 --> 00:06:00.625
of ancient technology
and the modern solar panels.

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:03.682
Now, on a different note for a second,

00:06:03.702 --> 00:06:07.620
71% of our world is covered in water;

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.855
96.5% of this is found in the oceans.

00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:14.846
Now, of all of this water
that covers our planet,

00:06:14.866 --> 00:06:18.193
only one percent is able to be drunk,

00:06:18.213 --> 00:06:21.636
and only one percent
holds the basic properties

00:06:21.656 --> 00:06:23.600
needed to make it consumable.

00:06:25.241 --> 00:06:27.055
Now, I want you guys to remember this

00:06:27.073 --> 00:06:29.564
because this becomes important
a little bit later.

00:06:29.584 --> 00:06:34.646
But for centuries, humans have used water
to scientifically aid our existence.

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:39.331
In 1500 BC, the ancient Egyptians
created the first clock,

00:06:39.331 --> 00:06:40.475
which was a water clock

00:06:40.485 --> 00:06:43.602
where they used a water-dripping vessel

00:06:43.622 --> 00:06:46.395
which was calibrated
against the movements of the Sun

00:06:46.415 --> 00:06:47.770
to tell the time.

00:06:48.442 --> 00:06:49.683
Now, interestingly enough,

00:06:49.703 --> 00:06:53.528
it was the most accurate time measurement
until the 17th century,

00:06:53.548 --> 00:06:56.391
when the pendulum clock was invented.

00:06:56.411 --> 00:07:00.371
Water has also been used
to further exemplify beauty

00:07:00.388 --> 00:07:05.875
and magnify what we know
as beautiful and as nature.

00:07:06.681 --> 00:07:12.504
So my idea was to apply this ancient
water-dropping technique to solar panels

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:17.340
in order to make a solar panel
mechanically track the Sun.

00:07:17.362 --> 00:07:20.198
It's called "The Solar System."

00:07:21.208 --> 00:07:25.092
Now, this water-drip system works
by matching the water tanks

00:07:25.112 --> 00:07:27.175
on one side of the solar panel

00:07:27.195 --> 00:07:30.274
to the force and strength
applied by a spring system

00:07:30.294 --> 00:07:31.525
on the other side.

00:07:31.545 --> 00:07:35.446
Now, this means that I'm able
to control the drip amount

00:07:35.446 --> 00:07:38.265
and slowly rotate the panel
throughout the day,

00:07:38.285 --> 00:07:40.211
matching the path of the Sun.

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:45.274
The Solar System could be an exciting tool
for developing communities

00:07:45.274 --> 00:07:49.533
as it's able to provide
both water and power

00:07:49.553 --> 00:07:50.664
by filtering the water

00:07:50.684 --> 00:07:52.888
once it comes out
of this water-drip system.

00:07:52.908 --> 00:07:55.262
We can provide developing communities

00:07:55.282 --> 00:08:00.223
with a safe access, a safe reliable
water source and power.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.753
A 72% increase in power output shows you

00:08:05.753 --> 00:08:09.175
how ancient technology can be refocused,

00:08:09.195 --> 00:08:12.451
and how we can bring
the past into the future.

00:08:14.062 --> 00:08:16.125
When Thomas Edison was asked,

00:08:16.135 --> 00:08:18.741
"How did it feel to fail countless times?"

00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:19.904
he replied,

00:08:20.804 --> 00:08:23.184
"I didn't fail 1,000 times.

00:08:23.204 --> 00:08:26.561
The light bulb was an invention
with 1,000 steps."

00:08:27.358 --> 00:08:29.322
Now, I know that I'm going to fail,

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.966
and I'm going to be
disappointed constantly,

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:35.452
but when this happens, it just means
that you need to get up,

00:08:35.905 --> 00:08:38.057
it means that you need to try harder,

00:08:38.077 --> 00:08:40.784
and it means that you need
to try something different.

00:08:41.197 --> 00:08:43.486
We need to start experimenting

00:08:43.486 --> 00:08:46.565
with a childlike
curiosity and imagination,

00:08:46.585 --> 00:08:49.342
which can be inspired by the past.

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:52.996
And don't let anyone tell you
that your age matters.

00:08:53.016 --> 00:08:56.004
Don't let anyone tell you
that your gender matters.

00:08:56.024 --> 00:09:00.139
Anyone can find simple solutions
to global problems.

00:09:00.158 --> 00:09:01.729
The answers are out there.

00:09:01.749 --> 00:09:04.442
Someone just needs to go
and rediscover them.

00:09:04.456 --> 00:09:08.048
Start by using the past
to change the future.

00:09:08.065 --> 00:09:09.073
Thank you.

00:09:09.086 --> 00:09:12.075
(Cheers) (Applause)
