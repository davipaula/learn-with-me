00:00:13.507 --> 00:00:15.396
In 2003,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.333
when we sequenced the human genome,

00:00:18.357 --> 00:00:22.279
we thought we would have the answer
to treat many diseases.

00:00:22.974 --> 00:00:25.631
But the reality is far from that,

00:00:26.782 --> 00:00:28.703
because in addition to our genes,

00:00:28.727 --> 00:00:33.297
our environment and lifestyle
could have a significant role

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:35.869
in developing many major diseases.

00:00:35.893 --> 00:00:39.473
One example is fatty liver disease,

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:43.580
which is affecting over 20 percent
of the population globally,

00:00:43.604 --> 00:00:46.638
and it has no treatment
and leads to liver cancer

00:00:46.662 --> 00:00:48.085
or liver failure.

00:00:49.517 --> 00:00:54.261
So sequencing DNA alone
doesn't give us enough information

00:00:54.285 --> 00:00:56.517
to find effective therapeutics.

00:00:56.541 --> 00:01:00.297
On the bright side, there are
many other molecules in our body.

00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:04.301
In fact, there are
over 100,000 metabolites.

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:08.621
Metabolites are any molecule
that is supersmall in their size.

00:01:09.193 --> 00:01:14.165
Known examples are glucose,
fructose, fats, cholesterol --

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.699
things we hear all the time.

00:01:16.273 --> 00:01:19.256
Metabolites are involved
in our metabolism.

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:24.094
They are also downstream of DNA,

00:01:24.118 --> 00:01:29.200
so they carry information
from both our genes as well as lifestyle.

00:01:29.224 --> 00:01:34.873
Understanding metabolites is essential
to find treatments for many diseases.

00:01:34.897 --> 00:01:37.109
I've always wanted to treat patients.

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:41.792
Despite that, 15 years ago,
I left medical school,

00:01:41.816 --> 00:01:43.781
as I missed mathematics.

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:47.955
Soon after, I found the coolest thing:

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:51.455
I can use mathematics to study medicine.

00:01:53.026 --> 00:01:58.239
Since then, I've been developing
algorithms to analyze biological data.

00:01:59.092 --> 00:02:01.375
So, it sounded easy:

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.000
let's collect data from all
the metabolites in our body,

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:10.152
develop mathematical models to describe
how they are changed in a disease

00:02:10.176 --> 00:02:13.164
and intervene in those
changes to treat them.

00:02:14.488 --> 00:02:17.960
Then I realized why no one
has done this before:

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.917
it's extremely difficult.

00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:22.028
(Laughter)

00:02:22.052 --> 00:02:24.464
There are many metabolites in our body.

00:02:24.783 --> 00:02:27.283
Each one is different from the other one.

00:02:27.307 --> 00:02:31.035
For some metabolites,
we can measure their molecular mass

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:33.652
using mass spectrometry instruments.

00:02:33.676 --> 00:02:38.069
But because there could be, like,
10 molecules with the exact same mass,

00:02:38.093 --> 00:02:39.900
we don't know exactly what they are,

00:02:39.924 --> 00:02:42.698
and if you want to clearly
identify all of them,

00:02:42.722 --> 00:02:45.826
you have to do more experiments,
which could take decades

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.564
and billions of dollars.

00:02:48.207 --> 00:02:53.770
So we developed an artificial
intelligence, or AI, platform, to do that.

00:02:53.794 --> 00:02:56.638
We leveraged the growth of biological data

00:02:56.662 --> 00:03:01.086
and built a database of any existing
information about metabolites

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.238
and their interactions
with other molecules.

00:03:04.262 --> 00:03:07.686
We combined all this data
as a meganetwork.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.106
Then, from tissues or blood of patients,

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.881
we measure masses of metabolites

00:03:13.905 --> 00:03:17.164
and find the masses
that are changed in a disease.

00:03:17.188 --> 00:03:20.378
But, as I mentioned earlier,
we don't know exactly what they are.

00:03:20.402 --> 00:03:25.537
A molecular mass of 180 could be
either the glucose, galactose or fructose.

00:03:25.561 --> 00:03:27.580
They all have the exact same mass

00:03:27.604 --> 00:03:29.691
but different functions in our body.

00:03:29.715 --> 00:03:33.302
Our AI algorithm considered
all these ambiguities.

00:03:33.326 --> 00:03:36.062
It then mined that meganetwork

00:03:36.086 --> 00:03:40.439
to find how those metabolic masses
are connected to each other

00:03:40.463 --> 00:03:42.421
that result in disease.

00:03:42.445 --> 00:03:44.683
And because of the way they are connected,

00:03:44.707 --> 00:03:49.030
then we are able to infer
what each metabolite mass is,

00:03:49.054 --> 00:03:51.978
like that 180 could be glucose here,

00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:54.553
and, more importantly, to discover

00:03:54.577 --> 00:03:57.944
how changes in glucose
and other metabolites

00:03:57.968 --> 00:03:59.473
lead to a disease.

00:03:59.497 --> 00:04:02.492
This novel understanding
of disease mechanisms

00:04:02.516 --> 00:04:07.008
then enable us to discover
effective therapeutics to target that.

00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:11.446
So we formed a start-up company
to bring this technology to the market

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.275
and impact people's lives.

00:04:13.722 --> 00:04:17.267
Now my team and I at ReviveMed
are working to discover

00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:22.396
therapeutics for major diseases
that metabolites are key drivers for,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.317
like fatty liver disease,

00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:27.265
because it is caused
by accumulation of fats,

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.762
which are types
of metabolites in the liver.

00:04:29.786 --> 00:04:33.726
As I mentioned earlier,
it's a huge epidemic with no treatment.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.474
And fatty liver disease
is just one example.

00:04:36.498 --> 00:04:40.676
Moving forward, we are going to tackle
hundreds of other diseases

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.193
with no treatment.

00:04:42.217 --> 00:04:46.771
And by collecting more and more
data about metabolites

00:04:46.795 --> 00:04:50.339
and understanding
how changes in metabolites

00:04:50.363 --> 00:04:52.765
leads to developing diseases,

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.278
our algorithms will get
smarter and smarter

00:04:56.302 --> 00:05:00.498
to discover the right therapeutics
for the right patients.

00:05:00.522 --> 00:05:04.292
And we will get closer to reach our vision

00:05:04.316 --> 00:05:08.179
of saving lives with every line of code.

00:05:08.203 --> 00:05:09.524
Thank you.

00:05:09.548 --> 00:05:13.375
(Applause)
