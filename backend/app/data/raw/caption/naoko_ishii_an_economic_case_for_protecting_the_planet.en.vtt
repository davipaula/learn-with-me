00:00:13.672 --> 00:00:15.068
Good evening, everyone.

00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:18.098
I am from Japan,

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:23.550
so I'd like to start with a story
about Japanese fishing villages.

00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:31.075
In the past, every fisherman was tempted
to catch as many as fish as possible,

00:00:32.027 --> 00:00:35.431
but if everybody did that,

00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:40.724
the fish, common shared resource
in the community, would disappear.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.601
The result would be hardship
and poverty for everyone.

00:00:47.927 --> 00:00:51.228
This happened in some cases,

00:00:51.252 --> 00:00:55.934
but it did not happen in other cases.

00:00:56.694 --> 00:00:58.662
In these communities,

00:00:58.686 --> 00:01:03.124
the fishermen developed
a kind of social contract

00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:08.799
that told each one of them
to hold back a bit to prevent overfishing.

00:01:09.772 --> 00:01:13.208
The fisherman would keep
an eye on each other.

00:01:13.896 --> 00:01:18.048
There would be a penalty
if you were caught cheating.

00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:25.553
But once the benefit of a social contract
became clear to everyone,

00:01:25.577 --> 00:01:29.086
the incentive to cheat
dramatically dropped.

00:01:30.606 --> 00:01:33.170
We find the same story around the world.

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:38.412
This is how villagers in medieval Europe

00:01:38.436 --> 00:01:41.626
managed pasture and forests.

00:01:42.353 --> 00:01:46.930
This is how communities in Asia
managed water,

00:01:46.954 --> 00:01:52.525
and this is how indigenous peoples
in the Amazon managed wildlife.

00:01:53.858 --> 00:01:59.913
These communities realized
they relied on a finite, shared resource.

00:02:01.318 --> 00:02:07.402
They developed rules and practices
on how to manage those resources,

00:02:07.426 --> 00:02:09.855
and they changed their behavior

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:16.426
so that they could continue
to rely on those shared resources tomorrow

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.997
by not overfishing,

00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:20.974
not overgrazing,

00:02:20.998 --> 00:02:25.672
not polluting or depleting
water streams today.

00:02:26.572 --> 00:02:29.604
This is a story of the commons,

00:02:29.628 --> 00:02:36.223
and also how to avoid
the so-called tragedy of the commons.

00:02:37.462 --> 00:02:40.816
But this is also a story of an economy

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.071
that was mainly local,

00:02:43.095 --> 00:02:47.436
where everybody had
a very strong sense of belonging.

00:02:49.032 --> 00:02:51.746
Our economies are no longer local.

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.708
When we moved away from being local,

00:02:55.732 --> 00:02:59.906
we started to lose
our connection to the commons.

00:03:00.675 --> 00:03:06.508
We carried economic objectives,
goals and systems beyond the local,

00:03:06.532 --> 00:03:11.444
but we did not carry the notion
of taking care of the commons.

00:03:13.365 --> 00:03:17.356
So our oceans, forests,

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.314
once very close to us
as our local commons,

00:03:21.338 --> 00:03:24.210
moved very far away from us.

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:31.434
So today, we pump millions of tons
of greenhouse gases into the air,

00:03:33.098 --> 00:03:38.383
we dump plastics, fertilizers
and industrial waste

00:03:38.407 --> 00:03:40.890
into the rivers and oceans,

00:03:40.914 --> 00:03:44.351
and we cut down forests that absorb CO2.

00:03:45.486 --> 00:03:49.629
We make the wild biodiversity
much more fragile.

00:03:51.163 --> 00:03:53.839
We seem to have totally forgotten

00:03:53.863 --> 00:03:58.465
that there is such a thing
as global commons:

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.749
air, water, forests and biodiversity.

00:04:05.664 --> 00:04:08.829
Now, it is modern science

00:04:08.853 --> 00:04:13.140
that reminds us how vital
the global commons are.

00:04:14.536 --> 00:04:19.533
In 2009, a group of scientists proposed

00:04:19.557 --> 00:04:22.818
how to assess the health
of the global commons.

00:04:23.726 --> 00:04:29.798
They defined nine planetary boundaries
vital to our survival,

00:04:29.822 --> 00:04:33.275
then they measured how far we could go

00:04:33.299 --> 00:04:37.879
before we cross over
the tipping points or thresholds

00:04:37.903 --> 00:04:43.164
that would lead us to the irreversible
or even catastrophic change.

00:04:45.716 --> 00:04:49.621
This is where we were in the 1950s.

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:56.007
We broadly remained
within safe operating space,

00:04:56.031 --> 00:04:58.235
marked by the green line.

00:05:00.196 --> 00:05:02.394
But look at where we are now.

00:05:04.892 --> 00:05:09.170
We have crossed four of those boundaries,

00:05:09.194 --> 00:05:11.948
and we will be crossing others
in the future.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:16.461
How did we end up in this situation?

00:05:17.957 --> 00:05:21.258
Well, my personal story
may tell us something.

00:05:23.167 --> 00:05:25.317
Five years ago, I was appointed

00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:29.985
as CEO of the GEF,
Global Environment Facility,

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.748
but I am not a conservationist

00:05:33.772 --> 00:05:36.437
or an environmental activist.

00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:39.188
I am an economist,

00:05:39.212 --> 00:05:41.561
and for the last 30 years,

00:05:41.585 --> 00:05:47.045
I had worked for public finance
in my home country and around the world.

00:05:48.616 --> 00:05:51.450
I can tell you one thing for sure:

00:05:51.474 --> 00:05:53.815
during these 30 years,

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:57.888
the notion of the global commons
never crossed my mind.

00:05:58.657 --> 00:06:02.722
I didn't have a single conversation
about the global commons

00:06:02.746 --> 00:06:04.004
with my colleagues.

00:06:05.244 --> 00:06:09.118
This tells me that the notion
of the global commons

00:06:09.142 --> 00:06:13.074
was not really entering
into the big money decisions

00:06:13.098 --> 00:06:16.383
like state budgets or investment plans.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.914
And I'm wondering,
why do we have this sheer ignorance

00:06:21.938 --> 00:06:23.858
about the global commons,

00:06:23.882 --> 00:06:25.961
including me, myself?

00:06:27.835 --> 00:06:31.676
One possible explanation might be

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.840
that until recently,
it didn't really matter too much.

00:06:36.394 --> 00:06:40.524
Even if we mess up
some part of the environment,

00:06:40.548 --> 00:06:46.036
we were not fundamentally changing
the functions of the earth system.

00:06:47.072 --> 00:06:51.063
The global commons
had still enough capacity

00:06:51.087 --> 00:06:53.595
to take the punches we gave them.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.555
In fact, the fish were still plentiful,

00:06:59.325 --> 00:07:03.055
the fields for grazing were still vast.

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:07.397
Our mistake was to assume

00:07:07.421 --> 00:07:10.620
that the capacity
of the earth for self-repair

00:07:10.644 --> 00:07:11.952
had no limits.

00:07:12.752 --> 00:07:14.705
It does have limits.

00:07:15.812 --> 00:07:19.189
The message from
the science is very clear:

00:07:19.213 --> 00:07:22.443
we humans have become
an overwhelming force

00:07:22.467 --> 00:07:26.634
to determine the future
living conditions on earth,

00:07:26.658 --> 00:07:29.959
and what's more,
we are running out of time.

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:34.656
If we don't act on them,

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.038
we will be losing the global commons.

00:07:37.062 --> 00:07:40.720
It's only our generation
who are able to preserve it --

00:07:40.744 --> 00:07:42.847
preserve the commons as we know them.

00:07:44.193 --> 00:07:49.313
Now is the time we start managing
the global commons

00:07:49.337 --> 00:07:54.908
as our parents or our grandparents
managed their local commons.

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:59.298
The first thing we need to do

00:07:59.322 --> 00:08:05.357
is to simply recognize
that we do have the global commons

00:08:05.381 --> 00:08:07.944
and they are very, very important.

00:08:09.393 --> 00:08:13.291
Then we need to build
the stewardship of the global commons

00:08:13.315 --> 00:08:15.394
into all of our thinking,

00:08:15.418 --> 00:08:17.537
our business, our economy,

00:08:17.561 --> 00:08:19.077
our policy-making --

00:08:19.101 --> 00:08:20.838
in all of our actions.

00:08:21.567 --> 00:08:26.991
We need to recreate the social contract
of the fishing villages

00:08:27.015 --> 00:08:29.135
on the global scale.

00:08:31.539 --> 00:08:33.822
But what does it mean in practice?

00:08:34.875 --> 00:08:36.203
Where to start with?

00:08:37.375 --> 00:08:41.430
I see there are four key economic systems

00:08:41.454 --> 00:08:43.557
that fundamentally need to change.

00:08:44.396 --> 00:08:47.570
First, we need to change our cities.

00:08:48.298 --> 00:08:53.711
By 2050, two thirds of our population
will live in cities.

00:08:54.298 --> 00:08:56.433
We need green cities.

00:08:57.092 --> 00:09:00.854
Second, we need to change
our energy system.

00:09:00.878 --> 00:09:04.584
The world economy
must sharply decarbonize,

00:09:04.608 --> 00:09:06.861
essentially in one generation.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:12.700
Third, we need to change
our production-consumption system.

00:09:13.376 --> 00:09:19.725
We need to break away from current
take-make-waste consumption patterns.

00:09:20.686 --> 00:09:25.524
And finally, we need
to change our food system,

00:09:25.548 --> 00:09:28.114
what to eat and how to produce it.

00:09:28.644 --> 00:09:31.486
And all of those four systems

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:35.708
are putting enormous pressure
on the global commons,

00:09:35.732 --> 00:09:38.422
and it's also very difficult to flip them.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.918
They are extremely complex,

00:09:40.942 --> 00:09:43.610
with many decision-makers,
actors involved.

00:09:45.753 --> 00:09:48.641
Let's take the example of the food system.

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:54.199
Food production is currently responsible

00:09:54.223 --> 00:09:57.381
for one quarter
of greenhouse gas emissions.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:02.205
It is also a main user
of the world's water resources.

00:10:02.775 --> 00:10:08.767
In fact, 70 percent of today's water
is used to grow crops.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.447
Vast areas of tropical forest
are used for agriculture.

00:10:15.055 --> 00:10:18.757
This deforestation drives extinction.

00:10:18.781 --> 00:10:23.741
In fact, we are losing species
1,000 times faster

00:10:23.765 --> 00:10:24.979
than the natural rate.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.923
And on top of all of that bad news,

00:10:29.947 --> 00:10:34.127
one third of food produced today globally

00:10:34.151 --> 00:10:35.341
is not eaten.

00:10:35.768 --> 00:10:37.485
It's wasted.

00:10:39.449 --> 00:10:42.402
But there is the good news,

00:10:42.426 --> 00:10:43.576
good signs.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.580
Coalitions of stakeholders

00:10:47.604 --> 00:10:52.481
are now coming together
to try to transform the food system

00:10:52.505 --> 00:10:54.890
with one shared goal:

00:10:54.914 --> 00:10:59.466
how to produce enough
healthy food for everyone,

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:00.986
at the same time,

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.130
to try to cut, to sharply reduce,

00:11:04.154 --> 00:11:08.395
the footprint from the food system
on the global commons.

00:11:10.983 --> 00:11:12.682
I had an opportunity

00:11:12.706 --> 00:11:17.066
to fly over the Indonesian
island of Sumatra,

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:19.758
and I saw with my own eyes

00:11:19.782 --> 00:11:21.939
the massive deforestation

00:11:21.963 --> 00:11:26.162
to make room for palm oil plantations.

00:11:27.178 --> 00:11:31.879
By the way, palm oil is included
in thousands of food products

00:11:31.903 --> 00:11:33.504
we eat every day.

00:11:33.528 --> 00:11:36.599
The global demand for palm oil
is just increasing.

00:11:38.168 --> 00:11:42.304
In Sumatra, I met smallholder farmers

00:11:42.328 --> 00:11:46.946
who need to make a day-to-day living
from growing oil palm.

00:11:47.803 --> 00:11:50.652
I met global food companies,

00:11:50.676 --> 00:11:52.527
financial institutions

00:11:52.551 --> 00:11:54.606
and local government officials.

00:11:56.035 --> 00:12:01.846
All of them told me that they can't
make the change by themselves,

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:07.339
and only by working together
under a kind of new contract,

00:12:07.363 --> 00:12:08.926
or a new practice,

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:12.418
do they have a chance
to protect tropical forests.

00:12:13.891 --> 00:12:18.935
So it's so encouraging to see,
at least for the last few years,

00:12:18.959 --> 00:12:24.667
this new coalition among these committed
actors along the supply chain

00:12:24.691 --> 00:12:28.801
come together to try
to transform the food system.

00:12:29.392 --> 00:12:32.497
In fact, what they are trying to do

00:12:32.521 --> 00:12:38.941
is to create a new kind of social contract
to manage the global commons.

00:12:41.697 --> 00:12:45.039
All changes start at home,

00:12:45.063 --> 00:12:47.641
at your place and at my place.

00:12:48.626 --> 00:12:52.292
At GEF, Global Environment Facility,

00:12:52.316 --> 00:12:54.753
we have now a new strategy,

00:12:54.777 --> 00:12:58.283
and we put the global commons
at its center.

00:13:00.552 --> 00:13:03.257
I hope we won't be the only ones.

00:13:04.273 --> 00:13:09.877
If everybody stays on the sidelines,
waiting for others to step in,

00:13:09.901 --> 00:13:13.560
the global commons
will continue to deteriorate,

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:17.567
and everybody will be much worse off.

00:13:18.388 --> 00:13:22.904
We need to save ourselves
from the tragedy of the commons.

00:13:24.451 --> 00:13:30.093
So, I invite all of you
to embrace the global commons.

00:13:30.801 --> 00:13:34.641
Please do remember
that global commons do exist

00:13:34.665 --> 00:13:37.050
and are waiting for your stewardship.

00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:41.807
We all share one planet in common.

00:13:42.546 --> 00:13:44.871
We breathe the same air,

00:13:44.895 --> 00:13:46.887
we drink the same water,

00:13:46.911 --> 00:13:51.752
we depend on the same oceans,
forests, and biodiversity.

00:13:52.974 --> 00:13:56.379
There is no space
left on earth for egoism.

00:13:57.144 --> 00:14:02.659
The global commons must be kept
within their safe operating space,

00:14:02.683 --> 00:14:06.889
and we can only do it together.

00:14:08.071 --> 00:14:09.317
Thank you so much.

00:14:09.341 --> 00:14:12.920
(Applause)
