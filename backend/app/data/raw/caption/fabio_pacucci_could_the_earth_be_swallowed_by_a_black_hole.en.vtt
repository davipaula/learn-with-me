00:00:06.848 --> 00:00:10.735
From asteroids capable 
of destroying entire species,

00:00:10.735 --> 00:00:16.670
to gamma-ray bursts and supernovae 
that could exterminate life on Earth,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.989
outer space has no shortage of forces
that could wreak havoc on our tiny planet.

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:24.724
But there’s something in space

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:28.222
that seems more terrifying 
than any of these –

00:00:28.222 --> 00:00:31.765
something that wipes out 
everything it comes near.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:36.862
Could the Earth 
be swallowed by a black hole?

00:00:36.862 --> 00:00:39.300
A black hole is an object so dense

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.298
that space and time around it 
are inescapably modified,

00:00:44.298 --> 00:00:46.370
warped into an infinite sink.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.441
Nothing, not even light,
can move fast enough

00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:53.798
to escape a black hole’s 
gravitational pull

00:00:53.798 --> 00:00:56.230
once it passes a certain boundary,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.905
known as the event horizon.

00:00:58.905 --> 00:01:03.993
Thus, a black hole is like a cosmic
vacuum cleaner with infinite capacity,

00:01:03.993 --> 00:01:08.923
gobbling up everything in its path, 
and letting nothing out.

00:01:08.923 --> 00:01:12.102
To determine whether a black hole 
could swallow the Earth,

00:01:12.102 --> 00:01:15.032
we first have to figure out 
where they are.

00:01:15.032 --> 00:01:18.623
But since they don’t emit light, 
how’s that possible?

00:01:18.623 --> 00:01:23.358
Fortunately, we’re able to observe 
their effect on the space around them.

00:01:23.358 --> 00:01:25.730
When matter approaches a black hole,

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.203
the immense gravitational field
accelerates it to high speed.

00:01:30.203 --> 00:01:33.101
This emits an enormous amount of light.

00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:35.786
And for objects too far away 
to be sucked in,

00:01:35.786 --> 00:01:40.254
the massive gravitational force 
still affects their orbits.

00:01:40.254 --> 00:01:45.069
If we observe several stars orbiting
around an apparently empty point,

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.173
a black hole could be leading the dance.

00:01:48.173 --> 00:01:52.238
Similarly, light that passes
close enough to an event horizon

00:01:52.238 --> 00:01:57.803
will be deflected in a phenomenon 
known as gravitational lensing.

00:01:57.803 --> 00:02:02.361
Most of the black holes that we’ve found 
can be thought of as two main types.

00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:05.698
The smaller ones, 
called stellar mass black holes,

00:02:05.698 --> 00:02:10.361
have a mass up to 100 times larger 
than that of our sun.

00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:14.442
They’re formed when a massive star 
consumes all its nuclear fuel

00:02:14.442 --> 00:02:17.692
and its core collapses.

00:02:17.692 --> 00:02:22.878
We’ve observed several of these
objects as close as 3000 light-years away,

00:02:22.878 --> 00:02:26.533
and there could be up to 100 million 
small black holes

00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:29.441
just in the Milky Way galaxy.

00:02:29.441 --> 00:02:31.163
So should we be worried?

00:02:31.163 --> 00:02:32.631
Probably not.

00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:34.257
Despite their large mass,

00:02:34.257 --> 00:02:40.214
stellar black holes only have a radius 
of around 300 kilometers or less,

00:02:40.214 --> 00:02:44.036
making the chances 
of a direct hit with us miniscule.

00:02:44.036 --> 00:02:46.229
Although because 
their gravitational fields

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:48.544
can affect a planet from a large distance,

00:02:48.544 --> 00:02:52.166
they could be dangerous 
even without a direct collision.

00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:57.502
If a typical stellar-mass black hole 
were to pass in the region of Neptune,

00:02:57.502 --> 00:03:01.061
the orbit of the Earth 
would be considerably modified,

00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:03.431
with dire results.

00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:08.096
Still, the combination of how small 
they are and how vast the galaxy is

00:03:08.096 --> 00:03:11.821
means that stellar black holes
don’t give us much to worry about.

00:03:11.821 --> 00:03:14.667
But we still have to meet the second type:

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:17.423
supermassive black holes.

00:03:17.423 --> 00:03:22.648
These have masses millions or billions
times greater than that of our sun

00:03:22.648 --> 00:03:27.484
and have event horizons that
could span billions of kilometers.

00:03:27.484 --> 00:03:30.214
These giants have grown 
to immense proportions

00:03:30.214 --> 00:03:34.561
by swallowing matter 
and merging with other black holes.

00:03:34.561 --> 00:03:36.316
Unlike their stellar cousins,

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:39.887
supermassive black holes aren’t
wandering through space.

00:03:39.887 --> 00:03:45.374
Instead, they lie at the center 
of galaxies, including our own.

00:03:45.374 --> 00:03:50.318
Our solar system is in a stable orbit 
around a supermassive black hole

00:03:50.318 --> 00:03:53.344
that resides 
at the center of the Milky Way,

00:03:53.344 --> 00:03:57.150
at a safe distance of 25,000 light-years.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.863
But that could change.

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:01.129
If our galaxy collides with another,

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:04.239
the Earth could be thrown towards 
the galactic center,

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.803
close enough 
to the supermassive black hole

00:04:06.803 --> 00:04:09.478
to be eventually swallowed up.

00:04:09.478 --> 00:04:12.585
In fact, a collision 
with the Andromeda Galaxy

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:16.359
is predicted to happen 
4 billion years from now,

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.338
which may not be great news
for our home planet.

00:04:19.338 --> 00:04:22.120
But before we judge them too harshly,

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.417
black holes aren’t simply agents 
of destruction.

00:04:25.417 --> 00:04:28.696
They played a crucial role 
in the formation of galaxies,

00:04:28.696 --> 00:04:31.422
the building blocks of our universe.

00:04:31.422 --> 00:04:35.160
Far from being shadowy characters 
in the cosmic play,

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.713
black holes have fundamentally contributed

00:04:37.713 --> 00:04:41.885
in making the universe 
a bright and astonishing place.
