00:00:12.752 --> 00:00:14.928
I'm a scientist,

00:00:14.952 --> 00:00:18.040
and I'm a big fan of Star Trek,

00:00:18.064 --> 00:00:20.540
especially of Mr. Spock.

00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:23.807
Mr. Spock is a scientist as well,

00:00:23.831 --> 00:00:25.988
and at the same time,
he's the first [officer]

00:00:26.012 --> 00:00:28.980
of the starship Enterprise,

00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:32.124
and during the adventures
of the Enterprise crew,

00:00:32.148 --> 00:00:34.274
he and his colleagues are dealing a lot

00:00:34.298 --> 00:00:38.940
with the presence or absence
of Mr. Spock's emotions.

00:00:39.924 --> 00:00:43.631
Mr. Spock is half-human and half-Vulcan,

00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:46.313
and Vulcans are an alien race

00:00:46.337 --> 00:00:49.052
who learn to control
and suppress their feelings

00:00:49.076 --> 00:00:51.090
and to act purely out of logic.

00:00:51.995 --> 00:00:54.710
As Mr. Spock is only half-Vulcan,

00:00:54.734 --> 00:01:00.291
he sees himself constantly in conflict
in between logic and emotions,

00:01:00.315 --> 00:01:02.339
and as he's part of a team,

00:01:02.363 --> 00:01:05.243
the whole crew is struggling with,

00:01:05.267 --> 00:01:07.038
is analyzing,

00:01:07.062 --> 00:01:08.887
and is making fun of this conflict.

00:01:09.566 --> 00:01:12.473
And also the fans of Star Trek
watch with amusement

00:01:12.497 --> 00:01:14.728
this seemingly contradictory behavior.

00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:18.268
They find it quite fascinating.

00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:21.028
And the matter is a golden thread

00:01:21.052 --> 00:01:24.715
through the whole Star Trek series
and movies from the '60s until today.

00:01:25.091 --> 00:01:27.916
And that's actually
what I want to talk about today:

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.266
the role of emotions in science.

00:01:31.353 --> 00:01:35.696
We tend to think that science
is all about facts and logic

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.029
and human feelings are often neglected
or considered an obstacle to get rid of.

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:45.300
I would like to suggest that emotions
are as important in science

00:01:45.324 --> 00:01:47.585
as they are in any other part
of our lives.

00:01:48.195 --> 00:01:50.378
Science is made by humans,

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:52.107
and as human beings,

00:01:52.131 --> 00:01:55.945
even if we try hard,
we cannot get rid of our emotions.

00:01:56.704 --> 00:01:58.883
So instead of fighting them,

00:01:58.907 --> 00:02:02.455
I believe that even in science,
we should make use of our feelings,

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.685
because for breakthroughs and innovation,

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.320
they are equally important
as facts and logic.

00:02:09.256 --> 00:02:11.216
I will come back to Mr. Spock,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.392
but first let me share my experience
on the role of emotions in science,

00:02:16.416 --> 00:02:19.305
and one story in particular
kept me thinking about it

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.026
for the last couple of years.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.195
I'm working in research
on organic light-emitting diodes,

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:27.742
so-called OLEDs.

00:02:28.233 --> 00:02:30.238
This is how you might know them,

00:02:30.262 --> 00:02:32.516
as new generation of displays.

00:02:33.262 --> 00:02:37.587
OLEDs are more and more used
in smartphone displays and TV screens.

00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:42.318
They make them appear bright,
truly colorful and bendable.

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:45.214
This is how they look like

00:02:45.238 --> 00:02:47.846
in the research lab
of my physicist colleagues.

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:51.170
And this is what I, as a chemist,

00:02:51.194 --> 00:02:53.638
have in mind when I think about them.

00:02:53.662 --> 00:02:56.527
I've loved it ever since
I started to work on it.

00:02:57.415 --> 00:02:59.611
So I didn't really like the news

00:02:59.635 --> 00:03:01.953
when the company I had been working for --

00:03:01.977 --> 00:03:04.179
that was my previous employer --

00:03:04.203 --> 00:03:07.004
announced that they wanted
to stop OLED research.

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.090
At the time, the management
had reasons for this decision,

00:03:11.114 --> 00:03:13.532
and the company handled it
very well, actually.

00:03:13.556 --> 00:03:15.336
Nobody lost their jobs,

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.106
and everybody was rewarded
for their performed work.

00:03:19.043 --> 00:03:20.457
What I want to show you today

00:03:20.481 --> 00:03:23.403
is what happened
with my scientist colleagues and me

00:03:23.427 --> 00:03:26.164
during the time in between
the announcement

00:03:26.188 --> 00:03:28.466
and the last working day on our project.

00:03:29.067 --> 00:03:32.916
Consider it a small case study
on emotions in science.

00:03:34.454 --> 00:03:39.231
In 2015, our research team
had grown to more than 80 people,

00:03:39.255 --> 00:03:42.724
and even after the announcement
that our project was discontinued,

00:03:42.748 --> 00:03:45.236
we could not stop working
from one day to another.

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:49.690
It took several months
to bring all activities to a sound end

00:03:49.714 --> 00:03:52.602
and to find new jobs
within the company for everyone.

00:03:53.088 --> 00:03:54.421
Here's what happened.

00:03:54.445 --> 00:03:57.092
Even though we knew
that we were working on a project

00:03:57.116 --> 00:03:59.112
that was to be stopped,

00:03:59.136 --> 00:04:02.218
during those months
our output hit the roof.

00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:06.757
We were actually working
on two different OLED projects:

00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:10.774
first, the development of materials
for blue-shining OLEDs,

00:04:10.798 --> 00:04:13.434
which had started in 2001;

00:04:13.458 --> 00:04:19.131
and second, materials for green OLEDs,
which had started in 2014.

00:04:19.155 --> 00:04:22.472
And the results I show you here
concern the green OLED project.

00:04:23.297 --> 00:04:26.029
In the graph, you can see
how the lifetime,

00:04:26.053 --> 00:04:29.840
which is a crucial measure
for the durability of our devices,

00:04:29.864 --> 00:04:31.521
developed over time.

00:04:32.677 --> 00:04:36.748
In 2015, just half a year
into the project,

00:04:36.772 --> 00:04:39.178
we were told to scale down,

00:04:39.202 --> 00:04:42.377
to stop working on the project
as soon as possible

00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:44.194
and to start over in other jobs.

00:04:44.987 --> 00:04:47.528
Nevertheless, from this time on,

00:04:47.552 --> 00:04:50.555
our results continued to improve rapidly.

00:04:52.097 --> 00:04:53.247
How did that happen?

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.333
After the announcement, pretty quickly,
colleagues started leaving the team,

00:04:59.357 --> 00:05:01.793
and soon, we were left in a small group,

00:05:01.817 --> 00:05:04.861
all pretty much sharing
the same attitude of,

00:05:04.885 --> 00:05:07.448
"I'm going to be the last person
leaving the ship."

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:09.882
What I mean is,

00:05:09.906 --> 00:05:13.935
while the number of scientists
working on the project was decreasing,

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:17.642
the dedication of people remaining
grew dramatically.

00:05:19.054 --> 00:05:22.634
And also, a new and more intense
team spirit formed.

00:05:23.543 --> 00:05:26.770
We all shared the same
passion for our work,

00:05:26.794 --> 00:05:30.071
we all were sad that it was about to end,

00:05:30.095 --> 00:05:33.865
and we all wanted to show
that we could turn our ideas into reality.

00:05:34.647 --> 00:05:37.488
We felt that we belonged
to something bigger.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.369
And furthermore,

00:05:40.393 --> 00:05:44.085
our project was less and less
in the focus of the management,

00:05:44.109 --> 00:05:46.816
because they started
to think about new projects,

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.537
restructuring and so on.

00:05:49.434 --> 00:05:52.157
This resulted in additional freedom

00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:56.203
and the possibility to take
a few things into our own hands.

00:05:57.001 --> 00:06:01.747
Of course, more freedom
also means more responsibility,

00:06:01.771 --> 00:06:05.637
which we were happy to take,
because we believed in our work.

00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:07.661
We felt empowered.

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:10.385
And these three pillars --

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:15.237
dedication, belonging and empowerment --

00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:18.706
worked together in a kind
of self-reinforcing cycle,

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.879
and the closer we got to shutdown,

00:06:20.903 --> 00:06:22.562
the better our output became.

00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:25.797
So we were working
with such personal engagement

00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:28.107
on a project already sentenced to death

00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:31.531
because we felt connected
to something meaningful.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.401
Of course, it was also a hard
and sometimes frustrating time,

00:06:38.425 --> 00:06:40.441
but we were sitting together in the lab,

00:06:40.465 --> 00:06:42.545
or occasionally in the cafÃ©,

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:45.926
sharing our sadness
about the end of our project

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.481
as well as the joy in our work.

00:06:48.505 --> 00:06:53.954
So overall, we had a very intense
and mesmerizingly exciting time.

00:06:54.466 --> 00:06:58.370
And the lifetime we finally obtained
for our materials

00:06:58.394 --> 00:07:01.933
was on one level with already
commercialized materials

00:07:01.957 --> 00:07:04.074
for green OLEDs at the time,

00:07:04.098 --> 00:07:06.637
and we achieved this within just one year.

00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:10.479
And those results helped our employer

00:07:10.503 --> 00:07:12.796
to sell the patents for real value.

00:07:14.923 --> 00:07:18.109
Now, let me tell you the same story

00:07:18.133 --> 00:07:21.856
with different characters
and a slightly different operation.

00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:24.051
The story is part of Star Trek.

00:07:24.602 --> 00:07:27.215
And sorry for those of you
who haven't seen the movies,

00:07:27.239 --> 00:07:29.205
but I need to introduce a spoiler here.

00:07:30.643 --> 00:07:35.331
After Mr. Spock sacrificed himself
to save the starship Enterprise

00:07:35.355 --> 00:07:37.655
at the end of Star Trek II,

00:07:37.679 --> 00:07:39.246
Captain Kirk and his core team

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.473
were determined to hunt
through the universe to search for Spock,

00:07:43.497 --> 00:07:46.081
even though they could see
only very little chance

00:07:46.105 --> 00:07:47.504
in finding him alive.

00:07:48.393 --> 00:07:51.194
And Starfleet Command
did not give them permission

00:07:51.218 --> 00:07:53.327
nor a starship to do so,

00:07:53.351 --> 00:07:56.772
so they took it very passionately
into their own hands

00:07:56.796 --> 00:07:58.684
to travel out to find Spock.

00:07:59.657 --> 00:08:03.575
And after dealing with great challenges,
they eventually found Spock,

00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:06.933
and he happily and gratefully
joined the team again.

00:08:08.235 --> 00:08:11.783
He could feel the dedication
and the connection of his team

00:08:11.807 --> 00:08:15.251
towards their project,
which was to save him

00:08:15.275 --> 00:08:16.807
and to hold the crew together.

00:08:18.172 --> 00:08:22.088
And over the years,
over the episodes of the saga,

00:08:22.112 --> 00:08:23.700
Mr. Spock came to realize

00:08:23.724 --> 00:08:28.743
that the combination
of both logic and emotions

00:08:28.767 --> 00:08:33.568
is crucial for facing challenges
and exploring new worlds,

00:08:33.592 --> 00:08:35.647
and there was no contradiction anymore.

00:08:37.151 --> 00:08:42.214
So the storyline here
for both our OLED story and Star Trek

00:08:42.238 --> 00:08:45.437
is actually the basic setting
for a lot of breakthrough stories,

00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:47.182
in and out of science.

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:51.882
The main characters
are all part of a great team.

00:08:52.915 --> 00:08:57.352
All team members show a huge dedication
towards reaching their goal.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.147
They strive to seize
all the freedom they can get,

00:09:02.171 --> 00:09:05.336
and they take the responsibility
they need to take.

00:09:07.299 --> 00:09:10.617
During the time our OLED project
was nearing the end,

00:09:10.641 --> 00:09:14.029
I received one piece of advice
several times.

00:09:15.218 --> 00:09:16.869
"Don't take it to your heart.

00:09:17.591 --> 00:09:19.361
You can work on something else."

00:09:20.456 --> 00:09:21.949
If I had followed it,

00:09:21.973 --> 00:09:25.663
it would have saved me
several depressed evenings

00:09:25.687 --> 00:09:26.852
and many tears,

00:09:28.095 --> 00:09:29.508
but at the same time,

00:09:29.532 --> 00:09:35.008
I would have failed to gain a great deal
in personal development and happiness.

00:09:36.375 --> 00:09:39.710
And as the same is true
for my colleagues and our whole project,

00:09:39.734 --> 00:09:41.463
we would have achieved far less.

00:09:42.614 --> 00:09:46.772
So of course, science
should be based on facts and logic.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.172
When I say we should use
our emotions in science,

00:09:51.196 --> 00:09:54.554
I do not suggest we should use
feelings instead of facts.

00:09:55.321 --> 00:09:58.659
But I say we should not be afraid
of using our feelings

00:09:58.683 --> 00:10:02.447
to implement and to catalyze
fact-based science and innovation.

00:10:03.229 --> 00:10:06.482
Emotions and logic
do not oppose each other.

00:10:06.967 --> 00:10:09.076
They complement each other,

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.949
and they reinforce each other.

00:10:12.317 --> 00:10:16.577
The feeling of being dedicated
to something meaningful,

00:10:16.601 --> 00:10:19.766
of belonging to something bigger

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:21.760
and of being empowered

00:10:21.784 --> 00:10:24.545
is crucial for creativity and innovation.

00:10:26.063 --> 00:10:27.563
Whatever you are working on,

00:10:28.643 --> 00:10:30.111
make sure that it matters,

00:10:31.254 --> 00:10:33.515
and take it to your heart
as much as you like.

00:10:34.642 --> 00:10:35.793
Thank you.

00:10:35.817 --> 00:10:40.563
(Applause)
