00:00:13.548 --> 00:00:17.286
So, let me thank you
for the opportunity to talk about

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.378
the biggest international story
of your professional lifetime,

00:00:22.402 --> 00:00:26.303
which is also the most important
international challenge

00:00:26.327 --> 00:00:29.490
the world will face
for as far as the eye can see.

00:00:29.514 --> 00:00:31.653
The story, of course,
is the rise of China.

00:00:32.106 --> 00:00:35.915
Never before have so many people
risen so far so fast,

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:37.750
on so many different dimensions.

00:00:38.336 --> 00:00:42.086
The challenge is the impact
of China's rise --

00:00:42.497 --> 00:00:46.776
the discombobulation
this will cause the Unites States

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.593
and the international order,

00:00:48.617 --> 00:00:52.898
of which the US has been
the principal architect and guardian.

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.152
The past 100 years have been what
historians now call an "American Century."

00:00:58.568 --> 00:01:01.069
Americans have become
accustomed to their place

00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:03.110
at the top of every pecking order.

00:01:03.862 --> 00:01:06.776
So the very idea of another country

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.815
that could be as big and strong
as the US -- or bigger --

00:01:10.839 --> 00:01:14.759
strikes many Americans
as an assault on who they are.

00:01:18.212 --> 00:01:22.633
For perspective on what
we're now seeing in this rivalry,

00:01:22.657 --> 00:01:26.323
it's useful to locate it
on the larger map of history.

00:01:27.089 --> 00:01:30.831
The past 500 years have seen 16 cases

00:01:30.855 --> 00:01:34.283
in which a rising power
threatened to displace a ruling power.

00:01:34.918 --> 00:01:37.476
Twelve of those ended in war.

00:01:39.434 --> 00:01:45.831
So just in November, we'll all pause
to mark the 100th anniversary

00:01:45.855 --> 00:01:50.363
of the final day of a war
that became so encompassing,

00:01:50.387 --> 00:01:54.699
that it required historians to create
an entirely new category: world war.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.345
So, on the 11th hour of the 11th day

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.061
of the 11th month in 1918,

00:02:03.085 --> 00:02:06.267
the guns of World War I fell silent,

00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:10.037
but 20 million individuals lay dead.

00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:14.932
I know that this
is a sophisticated audience,

00:02:14.956 --> 00:02:16.947
so you know about the rise of China.

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:21.815
I'm going to focus, therefore,
on the impact of China's rise,

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:25.196
on the US, on the international order

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.633
and on the prospects for war and peace.

00:02:28.402 --> 00:02:30.545
But having taught at Harvard
over many years,

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.570
I've learned that from time to time,
it's useful to take a short pause,

00:02:34.594 --> 00:02:37.230
just to make sure we're all
on the same page.

00:02:37.254 --> 00:02:39.602
The way I do this is, I call a time-out,

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:43.117
I give students a pop quiz --
ungraded, of course.

00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:45.646
So, let's try this. Time-out, pop quiz.

00:02:46.173 --> 00:02:47.783
Question:

00:02:47.807 --> 00:02:52.506
forty years ago, 1978, China sets out
on its march to the market.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.005
At that point, what percentage
of China's one billion citizens

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:02.174
were struggling to survive
on less than two dollars a day?

00:03:02.704 --> 00:03:04.634
Take a guess -- 25 percent?

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.410
Fifty?

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:08.203
Seventy-five?

00:03:09.998 --> 00:03:11.148
Ninety.

00:03:12.284 --> 00:03:13.484
What do you think?

00:03:14.895 --> 00:03:16.101
Ninety.

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:20.264
Nine out of every 10
on less than two dollars a day.

00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:23.817
Twenty eighteen, 40 years later.

00:03:24.427 --> 00:03:25.871
What about the numbers?

00:03:25.895 --> 00:03:27.045
What's your bet?

00:03:27.442 --> 00:03:28.592
Take a look.

00:03:33.125 --> 00:03:35.642
Fewer than one in 100 today.

00:03:36.498 --> 00:03:39.707
And China's president has promised
that within the next three years,

00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:42.914
those last tens of millions
will have been raised up

00:03:42.938 --> 00:03:44.404
above that threshold.

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.285
So it's a miracle, actually,
in our lifetime.

00:03:48.188 --> 00:03:49.378
Hard to believe.

00:03:49.402 --> 00:03:52.155
But brute facts are even harder to ignore.

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.555
A nation that didn't even appear
on any of the international league tables

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:57.895
25 years ago

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.371
has soared,

00:03:59.395 --> 00:04:02.664
to rival -- and in some areas,
surpass -- the United States.

00:04:06.964 --> 00:04:10.060
Thus, the challenge
that will shape our world:

00:04:10.924 --> 00:04:14.418
a seemingly unstoppable rising China

00:04:14.442 --> 00:04:19.053
accelerating towards an apparently
immovable ruling US,

00:04:19.077 --> 00:04:22.511
on course for what could be
the grandest collision in history.

00:04:24.323 --> 00:04:27.251
To help us get our minds
around this challenge,

00:04:27.275 --> 00:04:30.007
I'm going to introduce you
to a great thinker,

00:04:31.132 --> 00:04:33.133
I'm going to present a big idea,

00:04:33.887 --> 00:04:36.921
and I'm going to pose a most
consequential question.

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:40.982
The great thinker is Thucydides.

00:04:41.006 --> 00:04:43.320
Now, I know his name is a mouthful,

00:04:43.344 --> 00:04:45.462
and some people
have trouble pronouncing it.

00:04:45.486 --> 00:04:47.506
So, let's do it, one,
two, three, together:

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:48.903
Thucydides.

00:04:48.927 --> 00:04:51.839
One more time: Thucydides.

00:04:51.863 --> 00:04:53.529
So who was Thucydides?

00:04:53.942 --> 00:04:56.879
He was the father and founder of history.

00:04:56.903 --> 00:04:59.045
He wrote the first-ever history book.

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:03.180
It's titled "The History
of the Peloponnesian War,"

00:05:03.204 --> 00:05:06.526
about the war in Greece, 2500 years ago.

00:05:07.276 --> 00:05:10.466
So if nothing else today,
you can tweet your friends,

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.212
"I met a great thinker.

00:05:12.236 --> 00:05:15.594
And I can even pronounce
his name: Thucydides."

00:05:16.546 --> 00:05:21.244
So, about this war
that destroyed classical Greece,

00:05:21.268 --> 00:05:23.640
Thucydides wrote famously:

00:05:24.561 --> 00:05:31.459
"It was the rise of Athens
and the fear that this instilled in Sparta

00:05:31.483 --> 00:05:33.200
that made the war inevitable."

00:05:34.618 --> 00:05:36.855
So the rise of one

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:39.160
and the reaction of the other

00:05:39.184 --> 00:05:43.183
create a toxic cocktail of pride,

00:05:43.207 --> 00:05:46.001
arrogance, paranoia,

00:05:46.025 --> 00:05:48.467
that drug them both to war.

00:05:50.177 --> 00:05:52.080
Which brings me to the big idea:

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.558
Thucydides's Trap.

00:05:55.701 --> 00:05:58.982
"Thucydides's Trap" is a term
I coined several years ago,

00:05:59.006 --> 00:06:01.593
to make vivid Thucydides's insight.

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:06.799
Thucydides's Trap is the dangerous
dynamic that occurs

00:06:06.823 --> 00:06:10.656
when a rising power threatens
to displace a ruling power,

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.404
like Athens --

00:06:12.428 --> 00:06:16.926
or Germany 100 years ago,
or China today --

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.331
and their impact on Sparta,

00:06:19.355 --> 00:06:23.182
or Great Britain 100 years ago,
or the US today.

00:06:24.205 --> 00:06:26.125
As Henry Kissinger has said,

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:30.974
once you get this idea, this concept
of Thucydides's Trap in your head,

00:06:30.998 --> 00:06:32.677
it will provide a lens

00:06:32.701 --> 00:06:36.260
for helping you look through
the news and noise of the day

00:06:36.284 --> 00:06:38.884
to understand what's actually going on.

00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:45.450
So, to the most consequential question
about our world today:

00:06:46.863 --> 00:06:50.276
Are we going to follow
in the footsteps of history?

00:06:51.466 --> 00:06:57.481
Or can we, through a combination
of imagination and common sense

00:06:57.505 --> 00:06:58.862
and courage

00:06:58.886 --> 00:07:03.302
find a way to manage this rivalry

00:07:03.326 --> 00:07:06.294
without a war nobody wants,

00:07:06.318 --> 00:07:09.185
and everybody knows would be catastrophic?

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.403
Give me five minutes to unpack this,

00:07:12.427 --> 00:07:17.403
and later this afternoon, when the next
news story pops up for you

00:07:17.427 --> 00:07:20.837
about China doing this,
or the US reacting like that,

00:07:20.861 --> 00:07:24.280
you will be able to have a better
understanding of what's going on

00:07:24.304 --> 00:07:26.781
and even to explain it to your friends.

00:07:27.678 --> 00:07:32.179
So as we saw with this flipping
the pyramid of poverty,

00:07:32.203 --> 00:07:33.914
China has actually soared.

00:07:34.456 --> 00:07:35.606
It's meteoric.

00:07:36.354 --> 00:07:39.417
Former Czech president, Vaclav Havel,
I think, put it best.

00:07:39.441 --> 00:07:44.204
He said, "All this has happened so fast,
we haven't yet had time to be astonished."

00:07:44.228 --> 00:07:46.648
(Laughter)

00:07:46.672 --> 00:07:50.442
To remind myself
how astonished I should be,

00:07:50.466 --> 00:07:54.656
I occasionally look out the window
in my office in Cambridge

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.426
at this bridge, which goes
across the Charles River,

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.331
between the Kennedy School
and Harvard Business School.

00:08:00.933 --> 00:08:04.864
In 2012, the State of Massachusetts said
they were going to renovate this bridge,

00:08:04.888 --> 00:08:06.443
and it would take two years.

00:08:07.053 --> 00:08:09.520
In 2014, they said it wasn't finished.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.339
In 2015, they said
it would take one more year.

00:08:13.363 --> 00:08:15.141
In 2016, they said it's not finished,

00:08:15.165 --> 00:08:18.004
we're not going to tell you
when it's going to be finished.

00:08:18.004 --> 00:08:21.168
Finally, last year, it was finished --
three times over budget.

00:08:22.307 --> 00:08:27.815
Now, compare this to a similar bridge
that I drove across last month in Beijing.

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:29.587
It's called the Sanyuan Bridge.

00:08:30.284 --> 00:08:33.940
In 2015, the Chinese decided
they wanted to renovate that bridge.

00:08:33.964 --> 00:08:36.638
It actually has twice as many
lanes of traffic.

00:08:37.354 --> 00:08:40.095
How long did it take for them
to complete the project?

00:08:40.663 --> 00:08:42.415
Twenty fifteen, what do you bet?

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:46.688
Take a guess -- OK, three --

00:08:46.712 --> 00:08:47.997
Take a look.

00:08:52.748 --> 00:08:56.080
(Laughter)

00:09:00.236 --> 00:09:02.680
The answer is 43 hours.

00:09:02.704 --> 00:09:03.905
(Audience: Wow!)

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.658
(Laughter)

00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:19.172
Graham Allison: Now, of course,
that couldn't happen in New York.

00:09:19.196 --> 00:09:20.753
(Laughter)

00:09:21.482 --> 00:09:26.653
Behind this speed in execution
is a purpose-driven leader

00:09:26.677 --> 00:09:28.544
and a government that works.

00:09:29.657 --> 00:09:32.755
The most ambitious
and most competent leader

00:09:32.779 --> 00:09:36.260
on the international stage today
is Chinese President Xi Jinping.

00:09:36.284 --> 00:09:39.410
And he's made no secret
about what he wants.

00:09:39.434 --> 00:09:42.410
As he said when he became
president six years ago,

00:09:42.434 --> 00:09:46.288
his goal is to make China great again --

00:09:46.312 --> 00:09:48.149
(Laughter)

00:09:48.173 --> 00:09:52.486
a banner he raised long before
Donald Trump picked up a version of this.

00:09:53.919 --> 00:10:00.773
To that end, Xi Jinping has announced
specific targets for specific dates:

00:10:00.797 --> 00:10:05.483
2025, 2035, 2049.

00:10:06.257 --> 00:10:12.577
By 2025, China means to be
the dominant power

00:10:12.601 --> 00:10:16.886
in the major market
in 10 leading technologies,

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.934
including driverless cars, robots,

00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:22.810
artificial intelligence,
quantum computing.

00:10:23.204 --> 00:10:28.076
By 2035, China means to be
the innovation leader

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:30.567
across all the advanced technologies.

00:10:31.427 --> 00:10:35.445
And by 2049, which is
the 100th anniversary

00:10:35.469 --> 00:10:37.910
of the founding of the People's Republic,

00:10:37.934 --> 00:10:40.998
China means to be
unambiguously number one,

00:10:41.022 --> 00:10:45.956
including, [says] Xi Jinping,
an army that he calls "Fight and Win."

00:10:47.498 --> 00:10:50.228
So these are audacious goals,
but as you can see,

00:10:50.252 --> 00:10:53.339
China is already well on its way

00:10:53.363 --> 00:10:54.696
to these objectives.

00:10:55.387 --> 00:10:58.161
And we should remember
how fast our world is changing.

00:10:59.054 --> 00:11:00.641
Thirty years ago,

00:11:00.665 --> 00:11:04.012
the World Wide Web had not
yet even been invented.

00:11:05.086 --> 00:11:09.795
Who will feel the impact
of this rise of China most directly?

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:12.317
Obviously, the current number one.

00:11:13.185 --> 00:11:15.566
As China gets bigger
and stronger and richer,

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.590
technologically more advanced,

00:11:17.614 --> 00:11:22.428
it will inevitably bump up against
American positions and prerogatives.

00:11:23.495 --> 00:11:26.246
Now, for red-blooded Americans --

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:30.683
and especially for red-necked Americans
like me; I'm from North Carolina --

00:11:30.707 --> 00:11:33.041
there's something wrong with this picture.

00:11:33.689 --> 00:11:36.661
The USA means number one,
that's who we are.

00:11:38.721 --> 00:11:42.664
But again, to repeat:
brute facts are hard to ignore.

00:11:43.673 --> 00:11:47.585
Four years ago, Senator John McCain
asked me to testify about this

00:11:47.609 --> 00:11:50.743
to his Senate Armed Services Committee.

00:11:51.299 --> 00:11:55.036
And I made for them a chart
that you can see,

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.109
that said, compare the US and China

00:11:58.133 --> 00:12:02.649
to kids on opposite ends
of a seesaw on a playground,

00:12:02.673 --> 00:12:05.696
each represented by the size
of their economy.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.844
As late as 2004,
China was just half our size.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.886
By 2014, its GDP was equal to ours.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:20.218
And on the current trajectory,
by 2024, it will be half again larger.

00:12:22.744 --> 00:12:27.293
The consequences of this tectonic change
will be felt everywhere.

00:12:27.317 --> 00:12:29.609
For example, in the current
trade conflict,

00:12:29.633 --> 00:12:32.241
China is already
the number one trading partner

00:12:32.265 --> 00:12:35.577
of all the major Asian countries.

00:12:36.776 --> 00:12:39.144
Which brings us back
to our Greek historian.

00:12:40.331 --> 00:12:46.053
Harvard's "Thucydides's Trap Case File"
has reviewed the last 500 years of history

00:12:46.077 --> 00:12:49.831
and found 16 cases in which a rising power

00:12:49.855 --> 00:12:51.785
threatened to displace a ruling power.

00:12:52.344 --> 00:12:54.576
Twelve of these ended in war.

00:12:57.938 --> 00:13:03.231
And the tragedy of this
is that in very few of these

00:13:03.255 --> 00:13:06.035
did either of the protagonists want a war;

00:13:07.236 --> 00:13:10.538
few of these wars were initiated
by either the rising power

00:13:10.562 --> 00:13:11.921
or the ruling power.

00:13:11.945 --> 00:13:13.633
So how does this work?

00:13:13.657 --> 00:13:17.902
What happens is,
a third party's provocation

00:13:17.926 --> 00:13:20.379
forces one or the other to react,

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.235
and that sets in motion a spiral,

00:13:24.259 --> 00:13:27.128
which drags the two somewhere
they don't want to go.

00:13:27.152 --> 00:13:29.342
If that seems crazy, it is.

00:13:29.366 --> 00:13:30.607
But it's life.

00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:32.695
Remember World War I.

00:13:33.953 --> 00:13:36.815
The provocation in that case

00:13:36.839 --> 00:13:40.188
was the assassination
of a second-level figure,

00:13:40.212 --> 00:13:42.137
Archduke Franz Ferdinand,

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.204
which then led
the Austro-Hungarian emperor

00:13:46.228 --> 00:13:48.315
to issue an ultimatum to Serbia,

00:13:48.339 --> 00:13:50.093
they dragged in the various allies,

00:13:50.117 --> 00:13:52.893
within two months,
all of Europe was at war.

00:13:54.823 --> 00:13:58.753
So imagine if Thucydides were watching
planet Earth today.

00:13:58.777 --> 00:13:59.977
What would he say?

00:14:01.118 --> 00:14:05.959
Could he find a more appropriate
leading man for the ruling power

00:14:05.983 --> 00:14:07.418
than Donald J Trump?

00:14:07.442 --> 00:14:08.807
(Laughter)

00:14:08.831 --> 00:14:14.069
Or a more apt lead for the rising
power than Xi Jinping?

00:14:15.228 --> 00:14:17.236
And he would scratch his head

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:22.624
and certainly say he couldn't think
of more colorful provocateur

00:14:22.648 --> 00:14:24.907
than North Korea's Kim Jong-un.

00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:30.271
Each seems determined
to play his assigned part

00:14:30.295 --> 00:14:31.829
and is right on script.

00:14:33.311 --> 00:14:37.815
So finally, we conclude again
with the most consequential question,

00:14:37.839 --> 00:14:40.728
the question that will have
the gravest consequences

00:14:40.752 --> 00:14:42.783
for the rest of our lives:

00:14:45.211 --> 00:14:51.045
Are Americans and Chinese going to let
the forces of history drive us to a war

00:14:51.069 --> 00:14:53.281
that would be catastrophic for both?

00:14:54.099 --> 00:14:57.236
Or can we summon
the imagination and courage

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.242
to find a way to survive together,

00:15:00.355 --> 00:15:03.362
to share the leadership
in the 21st century,

00:15:03.386 --> 00:15:07.917
or, as Xi Jinping [said], to create
a new form of great power relations?

00:15:08.371 --> 00:15:10.903
That's the issue I've been
pursuing passionately

00:15:10.927 --> 00:15:12.506
for the last two years.

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.474
I've had the opportunity to talk
and, indeed, to listen

00:15:15.498 --> 00:15:17.656
to leaders of all
the relevant governments --

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.609
Beijing, Washington, Seoul, Tokyo --

00:15:21.633 --> 00:15:26.186
and to thought leaders across the spectrum
of both the arts and business.

00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.376
I wish I had more to report.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.448
The good news is that leaders
are increasingly aware

00:15:32.472 --> 00:15:34.822
of this Thucydidean dynamic

00:15:34.846 --> 00:15:36.406
and the dangers that it poses.

00:15:37.227 --> 00:15:39.945
The bad news is that
nobody has a feasible plan

00:15:39.969 --> 00:15:42.103
for escaping history as usual.

00:15:43.299 --> 00:15:45.910
So it's clear to me
that we need some ideas

00:15:45.934 --> 00:15:49.424
outside the box
of conventional statecraft --

00:15:49.919 --> 00:15:53.047
indeed, from another page
or another space --

00:15:54.707 --> 00:15:56.929
which is what brings me to TED today

00:15:56.953 --> 00:15:59.651
and which brings me to a request.

00:16:01.326 --> 00:16:06.695
This audience includes many
of the most creative minds on the planet,

00:16:06.719 --> 00:16:08.402
who get up in the morning and think

00:16:08.426 --> 00:16:11.171
not only about how to manage
the world we have,

00:16:11.195 --> 00:16:13.569
but how to create worlds that should be.

00:16:14.633 --> 00:16:19.752
So I'm hopeful that as this sinks in
and as you reflect on it,

00:16:19.776 --> 00:16:23.805
some of you are going to have
some bold ideas, actually some wild ideas,

00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:27.089
that when we find, will make
a difference in this space.

00:16:27.498 --> 00:16:29.910
And just to remind you if you do,

00:16:29.934 --> 00:16:31.545
this won't be the first time.

00:16:32.518 --> 00:16:35.480
Let me remind you of what happened
right after World War II.

00:16:36.875 --> 00:16:40.494
A remarkable group of Americans
and Europeans and others,

00:16:40.518 --> 00:16:44.259
not just from government, but from
the world of culture and business,

00:16:44.283 --> 00:16:47.350
engaged in a collective
surge of imagination.

00:16:48.498 --> 00:16:51.418
And what they imagined
and what they created

00:16:51.442 --> 00:16:53.816
was a new international order,

00:16:54.711 --> 00:16:58.497
the order that's allowed you and me
to live our lives, all of our lives,

00:16:58.521 --> 00:17:00.250
without great power war

00:17:01.307 --> 00:17:04.536
and with more prosperity
than was ever seen before on the planet.

00:17:05.804 --> 00:17:07.474
So, a remarkable story.

00:17:08.041 --> 00:17:13.931
Interestingly, every pillar of this
project that produced these results,

00:17:13.955 --> 00:17:15.545
when first proposed,

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:18.260
was rejected by the foreign
policy establishment

00:17:18.284 --> 00:17:21.432
as naive or unrealistic.

00:17:21.919 --> 00:17:23.903
My favorite is the Marshall Plan.

00:17:24.838 --> 00:17:27.536
After World War II,
Americans felt exhausted.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.578
They had demobilized 10 million troops,

00:17:29.602 --> 00:17:32.783
they were focused on
an urgent domestic agenda.

00:17:32.807 --> 00:17:37.003
But as people began to appreciate
how devastated Europe was

00:17:37.027 --> 00:17:39.781
and how aggressive Soviet communism was,

00:17:39.805 --> 00:17:43.725
Americans eventually decided
to tax themselves

00:17:43.749 --> 00:17:47.562
a percent and a half of GDP
every year for four years

00:17:47.586 --> 00:17:51.444
and send that money to Europe
to help reconstruct these countries,

00:17:51.468 --> 00:17:54.317
including Germany and Italy,

00:17:54.341 --> 00:17:56.848
whose troops had just
been killing Americans.

00:17:57.737 --> 00:17:58.887
Amazing.

00:17:59.792 --> 00:18:02.126
This also created the United Nations.

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:03.300
Amazing.

00:18:03.896 --> 00:18:06.882
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

00:18:06.906 --> 00:18:08.207
The World Bank.

00:18:08.231 --> 00:18:09.416
NATO.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.341
All of these elements of an order
for peace and prosperity.

00:18:13.365 --> 00:18:16.670
So, in a word, what we need
to do is do it again.

00:18:17.919 --> 00:18:23.078
And I think now we need a surge
of imagination, creativity,

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.272
informed by history,

00:18:26.077 --> 00:18:30.562
for, as the philosopher
Santayana reminded us,

00:18:30.586 --> 00:18:34.642
in the end, only those
who refuse to study history

00:18:34.666 --> 00:18:36.254
are condemned to repeat it.

00:18:37.087 --> 00:18:38.246
Thank you.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:42.201
(Applause)
