00:00:12.698 --> 00:00:16.302
About 200 years ago,

00:00:16.326 --> 00:00:19.917
Napoleon famously warned ...

00:00:21.595 --> 00:00:25.934
He said, "Let China sleep,

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.018
for when she wakes,

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:29.792
she will shake the world."

00:00:31.208 --> 00:00:33.976
Despite this early warning,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.101
the West chose to go to sleep

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:41.851
at precisely the moment
when China and India

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.333
and the rest of Asia woke up.

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:46.917
Why did this happen?

00:00:47.792 --> 00:00:50.792
I'm here to address this great mystery.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.875
Now what do I mean when I say
the West chose to go to sleep?

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.018
Here I'm referring
to the failure of the West

00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:03.476
to react intelligently and thoughtfully

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.059
to a new world environment
that's obviously been created

00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:08.417
by the return of Asia.

00:01:09.292 --> 00:01:13.018
As a friend of the West
I feel anguished by this,

00:01:13.042 --> 00:01:16.750
so my goal to today
is to try to help the West.

00:01:17.542 --> 00:01:20.226
But I have to begin the story first

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.226
by talking about how the West
actually woke up the rest of the world.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.875
Look at chart one.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.476
From the year one through the year 1820,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.625
the two largest economies of the world
were always those of China and India.

00:01:42.375 --> 00:01:47.684
So it's only in the last 200 years
that Europe took off,

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:49.375
followed by North America.

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:54.476
So the past 200 years of world history

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.458
have therefore been
a major historical aberration.

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:04.351
All aberrations come to a natural end

00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:06.434
and this is what we are seeing.

00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:08.726
And if you look at chart two,

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.518
you'll see how quickly and how forcefully

00:02:13.542 --> 00:02:17.667
China and India are coming back.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.934
The big question is:

00:02:20.958 --> 00:02:24.167
Who woke up China and India?

00:02:25.292 --> 00:02:30.768
The only honest answer to this question
is that it was Western civilization

00:02:30.792 --> 00:02:32.559
that did so.

00:02:32.583 --> 00:02:35.726
We all know that the West was the first
to successfully modernize,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.184
transform itself;

00:02:37.208 --> 00:02:41.309
initially it used its power
to colonize and dominate the world.

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:46.101
But over time, it shared the gifts
of Western wisdom

00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:48.184
with the rest of the world.

00:02:48.208 --> 00:02:52.434
Let me add here that I have
personally benefited

00:02:52.458 --> 00:02:55.059
from the sharing of Western wisdom.

00:02:55.083 --> 00:02:57.393
When I was born in Singapore,

00:02:57.417 --> 00:02:59.976
which was then a poor British colony,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.768
in 1948,

00:03:01.792 --> 00:03:06.143
I experienced, like three-quarters
of humanity then,

00:03:06.167 --> 00:03:08.059
extreme poverty.

00:03:08.083 --> 00:03:11.309
Indeed, on the first day
when I went to school

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:12.768
at the age of six,

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:15.184
I was put in a special feeding program

00:03:15.208 --> 00:03:19.643
because I was technically undernourished.

00:03:19.667 --> 00:03:21.684
Now as you can see I'm overnourished.

00:03:21.708 --> 00:03:23.684
(Laughter)

00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:29.208
But the greatest gift I got
was that of Western education.

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:34.309
Now since I've personally
traveled this journey

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:40.601
from third world poverty
to a comfortable middle-class existence,

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:45.684
I can speak with great conviction
about the impact of Western wisdom

00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:49.226
and the sharing of Western
wisdom with the world.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.226
And one particular gift
that the West shared

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.643
was the art of reasoning.

00:03:55.667 --> 00:03:58.518
Now reasoning was not
invented by the West.

00:03:58.542 --> 00:04:02.559
It's inherent in all cultures
and civilizations.

00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:09.333
Amartya Sen has described how deeply
embedded it is in Indian civilization.

00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:12.684
Yet there's also no doubt

00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:16.309
that it was the West
that carried the art of reasoning

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:18.851
to a much higher level.

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:20.768
And through the Scientific Revolution,

00:04:20.792 --> 00:04:22.309
the Enlightenment,

00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:24.768
the Industrial Revolution,

00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:28.601
the West really raised it forcefully,

00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:31.684
and equally importantly used this,

00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:37.309
applied it to solve
many major practical problems.

00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:41.393
And the West then shared
this art of applied reasoning

00:04:41.417 --> 00:04:43.184
with the rest of the world,

00:04:43.208 --> 00:04:46.059
and I can tell you that it led

00:04:46.083 --> 00:04:50.167
to what I call three silent revolutions.

00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:52.851
And as an Asian,

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:59.375
I can describe how these silent
revolutions transformed Asia.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.643
The first revolution was in economics.

00:05:04.667 --> 00:05:09.601
The main reason
why so many Asian economies,

00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:14.601
including the communist societies
of China and Vietnam,

00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:19.268
have performed so spectacularly well
in economic development,

00:05:19.292 --> 00:05:23.518
is because they finally understood,
absorbed and are implementing

00:05:23.542 --> 00:05:25.976
free market economics --

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.268
a gift from the West.

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:28.875
Adam Smith was right.

00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:32.309
If you let markets decide,

00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:34.250
productivity goes up.

00:05:35.625 --> 00:05:39.184
The second gift was psychological.

00:05:39.208 --> 00:05:42.000
Here too I can speak
from personal experience.

00:05:43.708 --> 00:05:45.101
When I was young,

00:05:45.125 --> 00:05:49.643
my mother and her generation believed

00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:53.059
that life was determined by fate.

00:05:53.083 --> 00:05:55.083
You couldn't do anything about it.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.934
My generation

00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.684
and the generation of Asians after me,

00:06:00.708 --> 00:06:02.809
believe that we can take charge

00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:04.917
and we can improve our lives.

00:06:05.708 --> 00:06:07.768
And this may explain, for example,

00:06:07.792 --> 00:06:13.726
the spike of entrepreneurship
you see all throughout Asia today.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.601
And if you travel through Asia today,

00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:23.184
you will also see the results
of the third revolution:

00:06:23.208 --> 00:06:27.393
the revolution of good governance.

00:06:27.417 --> 00:06:30.518
Now as a result of good governance --

00:06:30.542 --> 00:06:31.934
travel in Asia,

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.101
you see better health care,

00:06:34.125 --> 00:06:36.059
better education,

00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:38.101
better infrastructure,

00:06:38.125 --> 00:06:40.268
better public policies.

00:06:40.292 --> 00:06:41.542
It's a different world.

00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:45.643
Now having transformed the world

00:06:45.667 --> 00:06:49.351
through the sharing of Western wisdom
with the rest of the world,

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:54.018
the logical and rational response
of the West should have been

00:06:54.042 --> 00:06:58.792
to say, "Hey, we have to adjust
and adapt to this new world."

00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:03.333
Instead, the West chose to go to sleep.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.750
Why did it happen?

00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:09.268
I believe it happened

00:07:09.292 --> 00:07:15.667
because the West became distracted
with two major events.

00:07:16.625 --> 00:07:21.208
The first event
was the end of the Cold War.

00:07:21.917 --> 00:07:27.018
Yes, the end of the Cold War
was a great victory.

00:07:27.042 --> 00:07:32.726
The West defeated the mighty Soviet Union
without firing a shot.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.000
Amazing.

00:07:34.667 --> 00:07:38.184
But you know, when you have
a great victory like this,

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:43.059
it also leads to arrogance and hubris.

00:07:43.083 --> 00:07:48.643
And this hubris was best captured
in a very famous essay

00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:50.809
by Francis Fukuyama

00:07:50.833 --> 00:07:53.083
called "The End of History?"

00:07:54.083 --> 00:08:00.059
Now, Fukuyama was putting across
a very sophisticated message,

00:08:00.083 --> 00:08:03.643
but all that the West
heard from this essay

00:08:03.667 --> 00:08:07.559
was that we, the liberal democracies,

00:08:07.583 --> 00:08:09.434
we have succeeded,

00:08:09.458 --> 00:08:11.143
we don't have to change,

00:08:11.167 --> 00:08:12.434
we don't have to adapt,

00:08:12.458 --> 00:08:16.792
it's only the rest of the world
that has to change and adapt.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.559
Unfortunately, like a dangerous opiate,

00:08:22.583 --> 00:08:26.101
this essay did a lot
of brain damage to the West

00:08:26.125 --> 00:08:28.268
because it put them to sleep

00:08:28.292 --> 00:08:33.226
just at precisely the moment
when China and India were waking up

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.083
and the West didn't adjust and adapt.

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:41.643
The second major event was 9/11,

00:08:41.667 --> 00:08:45.433
which happened in 2001.

00:08:45.457 --> 00:08:51.601
And as we know, 9/11 caused
a lot of shock and grief.

00:08:51.625 --> 00:08:54.976
I personally experienced
the shock and grief

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.583
because I was in Manhattan
when 9/11 happened.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.851
9/11 also generated a lot of anger,

00:09:04.875 --> 00:09:09.559
and in this anger, the United States
decided to invade Afghanistan

00:09:09.583 --> 00:09:11.542
and later, Iraq.

00:09:12.625 --> 00:09:14.833
And unfortunately,

00:09:16.875 --> 00:09:19.309
partly as a result of this anger,

00:09:19.333 --> 00:09:24.101
the West didn't notice
the significance of another event

00:09:24.125 --> 00:09:27.458
that happened also in 2001.

00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:32.083
China joined the World Trade Organization.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:36.226
Now, when you suddenly inject

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:40.476
900 million new workers

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.101
into the global capitalist system,

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:45.851
it would naturally lead

00:09:45.875 --> 00:09:52.958
to what the economist Joseph Schumpeter
called creative destruction.

00:09:53.917 --> 00:09:57.893
Western workers lost their jobs,

00:09:57.917 --> 00:10:01.101
they saw their incomes stagnate,

00:10:01.125 --> 00:10:05.559
clearly people had to think
about new competitive policies,

00:10:05.583 --> 00:10:07.434
workers needed retraining,

00:10:07.458 --> 00:10:09.476
workers needed new skills.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.458
None of this was done.

00:10:12.542 --> 00:10:15.268
So partly as a result of this,

00:10:15.292 --> 00:10:17.393
the United States of America became

00:10:17.417 --> 00:10:23.809
the only major developed society

00:10:23.833 --> 00:10:29.601
where the average income
of the bottom 50 percent --

00:10:29.625 --> 00:10:32.976
yes, 50 percent --

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.101
average income went down
over a 30-year period,

00:10:38.125 --> 00:10:41.167
from 1980 to 2010.

00:10:43.875 --> 00:10:47.809
So partly, as a result of this,

00:10:47.833 --> 00:10:53.768
it led eventually to the election
of Donald Trump in 2016,

00:10:53.792 --> 00:10:56.809
who exploited the anger
of the working classes,

00:10:56.833 --> 00:10:58.851
who are predominantly white.

00:10:58.875 --> 00:11:03.518
It also contributed
to the rise of populism in Europe.

00:11:03.542 --> 00:11:05.226
And one wonders,

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.726
could this populism have been avoided

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:13.250
if the West had not been distracted
by the end of the Cold War and by 9/11?

00:11:14.792 --> 00:11:17.542
But the big question
we face today is this:

00:11:18.875 --> 00:11:20.768
Is it too late?

00:11:20.792 --> 00:11:22.958
Has the West lost everything?

00:11:23.917 --> 00:11:27.518
And my answer is that it's not too late.

00:11:27.542 --> 00:11:31.684
It is possible for the West to recover

00:11:31.708 --> 00:11:34.268
and come back in strength.

00:11:34.292 --> 00:11:36.625
And using the Western art of reasoning,

00:11:38.167 --> 00:11:43.768
I would recommend that the West
adopt a new "three-m" strategy:

00:11:43.792 --> 00:11:48.750
minimalist, multilateral
and Machiavellian.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.851
(Laughter)

00:11:50.875 --> 00:11:52.476
Why minimalist?

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.809
Now even though
Western domination has ended,

00:11:56.833 --> 00:12:00.809
the West continues to intervene
and interfere in the affairs

00:12:00.833 --> 00:12:02.684
of many other societies.

00:12:02.708 --> 00:12:04.309
This is unwise.

00:12:04.333 --> 00:12:07.018
This is generating anger and resentment,

00:12:07.042 --> 00:12:09.351
especially in Islamic societies.

00:12:09.375 --> 00:12:15.309
It's also draining the resources
and spirits of Western societies.

00:12:15.333 --> 00:12:18.559
Now I know that the Islamic world

00:12:18.583 --> 00:12:22.726
is having difficulties modernizing.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.268
It will have to find its way,

00:12:26.292 --> 00:12:31.059
but it's more likely to do so
if it is left alone to do so.

00:12:31.083 --> 00:12:35.684
Now I can say this with some conviction
because I come from a region,

00:12:35.708 --> 00:12:37.434
Southeast Asia,

00:12:37.458 --> 00:12:42.018
which has almost as many Muslims
as the Arab world.

00:12:42.042 --> 00:12:44.268
266 million Muslims.

00:12:44.292 --> 00:12:47.851
Southeast Asia is also one of the most
diverse continents on planet earth,

00:12:47.875 --> 00:12:50.559
because you also have
146 million Christians,

00:12:50.583 --> 00:12:52.393
149 million Buddhists --

00:12:52.417 --> 00:12:55.476
Mahayana Buddhists
and Hinayana Buddhists --

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.476
and you also have millions of Taoists
and Confucianists and Hindus

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.083
and even communists.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.393
And once known as "the Balkans of Asia,"

00:13:05.417 --> 00:13:10.226
southeast Asia today should
be experiencing a clash of civilizations.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.976
Instead, what you see in southeast Asia

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.184
is one of the most peaceful
and prosperous corners of planet earth

00:13:18.208 --> 00:13:22.351
with the second-most successful
regional multilateral organization,

00:13:22.375 --> 00:13:23.934
ASEAN.

00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.809
So clearly, minimalism can work.

00:13:26.833 --> 00:13:28.351
The West should try it out.

00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:30.726
(Laughter)

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.125
(Applause)

00:13:35.292 --> 00:13:39.143
But I'm also aware that minimalism
cannot solve all the problems.

00:13:39.167 --> 00:13:42.559
There are some hard problems
that have to be dealt with:

00:13:42.583 --> 00:13:44.643
Al-Qaeda, ISIS --

00:13:44.667 --> 00:13:47.101
they remain dangerous threats.

00:13:47.125 --> 00:13:50.143
They must be found,
they must be destroyed.

00:13:50.167 --> 00:13:53.976
The question is, is it wise for the West,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.226
which represents 12 percent
of the world's population --

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.184
yes, 12 percent --

00:13:59.208 --> 00:14:01.684
to fight these threats on its own

00:14:01.708 --> 00:14:05.893
or to fight with the remaining
88 percent of the world's population?

00:14:05.917 --> 00:14:08.268
And the logical and rational answer is

00:14:08.292 --> 00:14:11.643
that you should work
with the remaining 88 percent.

00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:12.976
Now where does one go

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.143
if you want to get
the support of humanity?

00:14:15.167 --> 00:14:16.976
There's only one place:

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.375
the United Nations.

00:14:19.042 --> 00:14:22.393
Now I've been ambassador to the UN twice.

00:14:22.417 --> 00:14:25.434
Maybe that makes me a bit biased,

00:14:25.458 --> 00:14:30.518
but I can tell you that working
with the UN can lead to success.

00:14:30.542 --> 00:14:32.768
Why is it that the first Iraq war,

00:14:32.792 --> 00:14:35.018
fought by President George H. W. Bush,

00:14:35.042 --> 00:14:36.684
succeeded?

00:14:36.708 --> 00:14:38.309
While the second Iraq war,

00:14:38.333 --> 00:14:41.226
fought by his son,
President George W. Bush,

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.601
failed?

00:14:42.625 --> 00:14:47.018
One key reason is that
the senior Bush went to the UN

00:14:47.042 --> 00:14:49.601
to get the support of the global community

00:14:49.625 --> 00:14:52.226
before fighting the war in Iraq.

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:54.976
So multilateralism works.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.934
There's another reason
why we have to work with the UN.

00:14:57.958 --> 00:14:59.851
The world is shrinking.

00:14:59.875 --> 00:15:05.393
We are becoming a small,
interdependent, global village.

00:15:05.417 --> 00:15:09.018
All villages need village councils.

00:15:09.042 --> 00:15:11.726
And the only global
village counsel we have,

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:15.226
as the late UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said,

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:16.500
is the UN.

00:15:18.583 --> 00:15:21.643
Now as a geopolitical analyst,

00:15:21.667 --> 00:15:27.518
I do know that it's often considered naive

00:15:27.542 --> 00:15:29.601
to work with the UN.

00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:33.042
So now let me inject
my Machiavellian point.

00:15:34.458 --> 00:15:39.559
Now Machiavelli is a figure
who's often derided in the West,

00:15:39.583 --> 00:15:45.351
but the liberal philosopher
Isaiah Berlin reminded us

00:15:45.375 --> 00:15:51.768
that the goal of Machiavelli
was to promote virtue, not evil.

00:15:51.792 --> 00:15:54.559
So what is the Machiavellian point?

00:15:54.583 --> 00:15:58.976
It's this: what is
the best way for the West

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.434
to constrain the new rising powers

00:16:02.458 --> 00:16:04.309
that are emerging?

00:16:04.333 --> 00:16:08.893
And the answer is
that the best way to constrain them

00:16:08.917 --> 00:16:13.434
is through multilateral rules
and multilateral norms,

00:16:13.458 --> 00:16:15.518
multilateral institutions

00:16:15.542 --> 00:16:18.375
and multilateral processes.

00:16:20.542 --> 00:16:25.351
Now let me conclude
with one final, big message.

00:16:25.375 --> 00:16:27.934
As a longtime friend of the West,

00:16:27.958 --> 00:16:34.559
I'm acutely aware of how pessimistic
Western societies have become.

00:16:34.583 --> 00:16:40.684
Many in the West don't believe
that a great future lies ahead for them,

00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:44.143
that their children
will not have better lives.

00:16:44.167 --> 00:16:50.958
So please do not fear the future
or the rest of the world.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:54.934
Now I can say this with some conviction,

00:16:54.958 --> 00:16:59.059
because as a Hindu Sindhi,

00:16:59.083 --> 00:17:03.684
I actually feel
a direct cultural connection

00:17:03.708 --> 00:17:06.768
with society's diverse cultures

00:17:06.792 --> 00:17:11.917
and societies all the way
from Tehran to Tokyo.

00:17:14.042 --> 00:17:19.309
And more than half of humanity
lives in this space,

00:17:19.333 --> 00:17:22.268
so with this direct cultural connection,

00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:25.059
I can say with great conviction

00:17:25.083 --> 00:17:31.101
that if the West chooses
to adopt a wiser strategy

00:17:31.125 --> 00:17:36.143
of being minimalist,
multilateral and Machiavellian,

00:17:36.166 --> 00:17:40.559
the rest of the world
will be happy to work with the West.

00:17:40.583 --> 00:17:45.226
So a great future lies ahead for humanity.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.601
Let's embrace it together.

00:17:47.625 --> 00:17:48.893
Thank you.

00:17:48.917 --> 00:17:52.000
(Applause)
