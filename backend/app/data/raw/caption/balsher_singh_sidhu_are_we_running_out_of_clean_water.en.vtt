00:00:07.088 --> 00:00:11.775
From space, our planet appears
to be more ocean than Earth.

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:15.831
But despite the water covering 71%
of the planet’s surface,

00:00:15.831 --> 00:00:20.962
more than half the world’s population
endures extreme water scarcity

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.676
for at least one month a year.

00:00:23.676 --> 00:00:26.735
And current estimates predict
that by 2040,

00:00:26.735 --> 00:00:31.961
up to 20 more countries could be 
experiencing water shortages.

00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:36.233
Taken together, these bleak statistics
raise a startling question:

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:39.253
are we running out of clean water?

00:00:39.253 --> 00:00:41.512
Well yes, and no.

00:00:41.512 --> 00:00:46.534
At a planetary scale, Earth can’t run out 
of freshwater thanks to the water cycle,

00:00:46.534 --> 00:00:50.409
a system that continuously produces 
and recycles water,

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.994
morphing it from vapour, to liquid, 
to ice as it circulates around the globe.

00:00:55.994 --> 00:00:59.197
So this isn’t really a question of 
how much water there is,

00:00:59.197 --> 00:01:02.615
but of how much of it 
is accessible to us.

00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:05.920
97% of earth’s liquid is saltwater,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.505
too loaded with minerals for humans
to drink or use in agriculture.

00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:14.594
Of the remaining 3% of potentially 
usable freshwater,

00:01:14.594 --> 00:01:19.073
more than two-thirds is frozen
in ice caps and glaciers.

00:01:19.073 --> 00:01:23.874
That leaves less than 1% available 
for sustaining all life on Earth,

00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:26.571
spread across our planet
in rivers, lakes,

00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:31.152
underground aquifers, ground ice
and permafrost.

00:01:31.152 --> 00:01:35.764
It’s these sources of water that are being
rapidly depleted by humans,

00:01:35.764 --> 00:01:39.097
but slowly replenished 
by rain and snowfall.

00:01:39.097 --> 00:01:43.436
And this limited supply isn’t distributed
evenly around the globe.

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:46.875
Diverse climates and geography
provide some regions

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:52.152
with more rainfall and natural water sources,
while other areas have geographic features

00:01:52.152 --> 00:01:55.608
that make transporting water 
much more difficult.

00:01:55.608 --> 00:01:58.695
And supplying the infrastructure 
and energy it would take

00:01:58.695 --> 00:02:03.405
to move water across these 
regions is extremely expensive.

00:02:03.405 --> 00:02:08.097
In many of these water-poor areas, as well
as some with greater access to water,

00:02:08.097 --> 00:02:13.013
humanity is guzzling up the local water
supply faster than it can be replenished.

00:02:13.013 --> 00:02:16.570
And when more quickly renewed 
sources can’t meet the demand,

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.604
we start pumping it out of our 
finite underground reserves.

00:02:20.604 --> 00:02:27.943
Of Earth’s 37 major underground reservoirs,
21 are on track to be irreversibly emptied.

00:02:27.943 --> 00:02:31.598
So while it’s true that our planet 
isn’t actually losing water,

00:02:31.598 --> 00:02:36.655
we are depleting the water sources
we rely on at an unsustainable pace.

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:38.232
This might seem surprising –

00:02:38.232 --> 00:02:42.690
after all, on average, people only drink 
about two liters of water a day.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.029
But water plays a hidden role in our daily
lives, and in that same 24 hours,

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:53.172
most people will actually consume
an estimated 3000 liters of water.

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:57.929
In fact, household water – which we use
to drink, cook, and clean –

00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:03.141
accounts for only 3.6% of humanity’s
water consumption.

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:07.432
Another 4.4% goes to the wide 
range of factories

00:03:07.432 --> 00:03:10.295
which make the products we buy each day.

00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:16.100
But the remaining 92% of our water
consumption is all spent on a single industry:

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.670
agriculture.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.696
Our farms drain the equivalent of
3.3 billion

00:03:21.696 --> 00:03:25.800
Olympic-sized swimming pools every year,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.583
all of it swallowed up by 
crops and livestock

00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:31.566
to feed Earth’s growing population.

00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:35.718
Agriculture currently covers 37% 
of Earth’s land area,

00:03:35.718 --> 00:03:39.036
posing the biggest threat to our 
regional water supplies.

00:03:39.036 --> 00:03:41.504
And yet, it’s also a necessity.

00:03:41.504 --> 00:03:47.718
So how do we limit agriculture’s thirst
while still feeding those who rely on it?

00:03:47.718 --> 00:03:51.676
Farmers are already finding ingenious
ways to reduce their impact,

00:03:51.676 --> 00:03:56.482
like using special irrigation techniques 
to grow “more crop per drop”,

00:03:56.482 --> 00:03:59.387
and breeding new crops 
that are less thirsty.

00:03:59.387 --> 00:04:01.415
Other industries are following suit,

00:04:01.415 --> 00:04:05.984
adopting production processes 
that reuse and recycle water.

00:04:05.984 --> 00:04:11.276
On a personal level, reducing food waste 
is the first step to reducing water use,

00:04:11.276 --> 00:04:16.135
since one-third of the food that leaves 
farms is currently wasted or thrown away.

00:04:16.135 --> 00:04:19.899
You might also want to consider 
eating less water-intensive foods

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:23.008
like shelled nuts and red meat.

00:04:23.008 --> 00:04:25.546
Adopting a vegetarian lifestyle 
could reduce

00:04:25.546 --> 00:04:28.674
up to one third of your water footprint.

00:04:28.674 --> 00:04:30.934
Our planet may never run out of water, 

00:04:30.934 --> 00:04:33.977
but it doesn’t have to for 
individuals to go thirsty.

00:04:33.977 --> 00:04:37.523
Solving this local problem 
requires a global solution,

00:04:37.523 --> 00:04:42.424
and small day-to-day decisions can 
affect reservoirs around the world.
