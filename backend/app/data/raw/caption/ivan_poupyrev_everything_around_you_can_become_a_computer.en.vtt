00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:15.714
Computers have become truly incredible.

00:00:16.523 --> 00:00:19.464
We are walking around
with supercomputers in our pocket.

00:00:19.488 --> 00:00:21.642
How amazing is that?

00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:23.651
So it is disappointing

00:00:23.675 --> 00:00:27.064
that the way we use computers,
the way we interact with them,

00:00:27.088 --> 00:00:30.124
hasn't really changed
in the last 50 years.

00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:34.305
We still use a mouse and keyboards.
We're clicking on screens and buttons.

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.502
Mobile phones are the same.

00:00:36.526 --> 00:00:39.370
We're just using fingers
instead of a mouse.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.617
So is that it?

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.446
Is that what the future looks like?

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.515
We're going to be stuck in the screens

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.664
with our faces not seeing
the world around us?

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.019
That's not the future I imagine,
or the future I'm attracted to.

00:00:53.043 --> 00:00:55.876
What I've been always
interested in is things,

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.034
physical things we use every day,
like things on this table

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:01.534
that the family doesn't pay attention to.

00:01:01.558 --> 00:01:03.693
Things tell our story.
They tell who we are.

00:01:03.717 --> 00:01:05.315
They tell a lot about us.

00:01:05.938 --> 00:01:07.740
Let me give you an example.

00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:13.083
These are photographs of things
a person touched during 24 hours.

00:01:13.107 --> 00:01:14.945
What can you tell about him?

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.265
He loves his motorcycle. Right?

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.374
The biggest thing in his picture.

00:01:19.398 --> 00:01:21.018
What can you tell about this girl?

00:01:21.774 --> 00:01:23.552
She spends all her time on the beach.

00:01:23.576 --> 00:01:24.989
There's a surfboard.

00:01:25.013 --> 00:01:26.599
She lives by the sea.

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:29.503
What can you tell about this guy?

00:01:29.527 --> 00:01:31.005
He's a chef.

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:33.730
Look at all the ingredients
he touched during the day,

00:01:33.754 --> 00:01:35.343
while he was preparing the food,

00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:38.410
and the computer
is a tiny part of his life,

00:01:38.434 --> 00:01:40.542
this sad thing in the corner.

00:01:41.804 --> 00:01:44.717
So if we are using things all the time,

00:01:44.741 --> 00:01:46.836
and this is a big part of our lives,

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.463
can things become the way for us
to interact with our digital life?

00:01:52.795 --> 00:01:55.429
Can the world become your interface?

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:58.055
That was my idea.

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.748
I've been working for 20 years on it.

00:02:00.772 --> 00:02:03.757
My idea is that in order
to interact in digital life,

00:02:03.781 --> 00:02:08.533
you don't need to have
screens and keyboards and mouses.

00:02:08.557 --> 00:02:10.739
You can interact with your digital life

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:13.501
just by using the things
you use every day.

00:02:14.057 --> 00:02:17.231
And to realize this idea,
I need to solve three big challenges.

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.207
Let me tell you about them.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.554
The first one, obviously:
Is it even possible?

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:28.412
How can you take an everyday thing
you use every day

00:02:28.436 --> 00:02:30.768
and turn it into a computer interface?

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.588
Now I was inspired by the book "Hackers."

00:02:33.612 --> 00:02:35.269
I read it when I was a teenager,

00:02:35.293 --> 00:02:39.307
and one of the essential
ideas of this book

00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:42.586
is that you can change
the purpose of things

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.895
by inventing new technology
and then hacking into things

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:47.137
and changing them.

00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:51.335
So I've been thinking
what kind of technology I can invent

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.335
so that I can hack into things
you use every day

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:56.732
and make them interactive.

00:02:57.763 --> 00:03:00.526
So when I was working on this thing,
I invented this sensor

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.478
which injects structured
electric fields into objects

00:03:03.502 --> 00:03:05.422
and turns them into gesture interfaces.

00:03:05.446 --> 00:03:08.981
So this doorknob, unmodified,
can become a gesture sensor.

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:12.339
It can know how you're touching it.
It can feel how you're touching it.

00:03:12.363 --> 00:03:14.557
It makes a circle, or can I grasp.

00:03:15.377 --> 00:03:16.981
And this doorknob isn't modified.

00:03:17.005 --> 00:03:18.961
There's nothing special about doorknobs.

00:03:18.985 --> 00:03:20.659
Anything can become interactive.

00:03:20.683 --> 00:03:22.183
What about plants?

00:03:22.948 --> 00:03:25.177
So plants are interesting,
because with plants,

00:03:25.201 --> 00:03:26.917
they can know where you're touching.

00:03:26.941 --> 00:03:29.495
You can see the line moving
up and down on the image.

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.679
And that can turn
into a musical interface.

00:03:31.703 --> 00:03:35.431
(Musical tones)

00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:39.793
Now, we do have also
practical applications:

00:03:39.817 --> 00:03:44.350
a calendar plant for those
who are obsessed about practicality.

00:03:44.374 --> 00:03:45.555
(Laughter)

00:03:48.114 --> 00:03:51.352
We can give things a personality.

00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:53.169
(Low notes changing in pitch)

00:03:53.193 --> 00:03:55.939
So in this particular example,

00:03:55.963 --> 00:03:59.033
the orchid can communicate to you

00:03:59.057 --> 00:04:02.287
through images and sounds.

00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:05.572
It doesn't like to be touched,
so it's created these electric images

00:04:05.596 --> 00:04:08.818
that are hissing at you.

00:04:08.842 --> 00:04:10.833
This plant, for example,

00:04:10.857 --> 00:04:13.605
is more robust, it's a snake plant,

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.772
and it likes playing with you.
It engages you.

00:04:16.146 --> 00:04:17.969
So every thing can be different,

00:04:17.993 --> 00:04:21.437
and every thing can represent
what it feels.

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:26.892
So everything can be hacked,
all the things, including your body.

00:04:26.916 --> 00:04:29.171
In this example, we hacked your body

00:04:29.195 --> 00:04:31.874
so you can measure
how you're folding your hands

00:04:31.898 --> 00:04:34.751
and then using your hand gestures
to control something else,

00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:37.827
so if you don't want to listen
to some music thousands of times,

00:04:37.851 --> 00:04:40.624
you simply can cover your ears
to turn it off.

00:04:40.978 --> 00:04:43.915
So everything can be hacked,
and research is important,

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:46.017
but the second challenge we have

00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:50.891
is how can we go from R and D,
and prototypes, to real products?

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:54.860
How can we make real things
that are also interfaces?

00:04:56.138 --> 00:04:58.646
And you may ask yourself,
who would do this?

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:59.952
Silicon Valley?

00:04:59.976 --> 00:05:01.510
Is it through Shenzhen?

00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:05.253
Now the challenge there
is that the world of things is huge.

00:05:05.757 --> 00:05:09.811
Every year, the apparel industry
produces 150 billion garments.

00:05:10.597 --> 00:05:15.939
In comparison, the technology industry
only makes 1.4 billion phones.

00:05:15.963 --> 00:05:20.126
The world of things is much bigger
than the world of technology.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.641
The technology world cannot change
the world of things.

00:05:23.665 --> 00:05:28.960
Instead, we need to create technology
which changes makers of things,

00:05:28.984 --> 00:05:31.795
people who make your chairs
and clothes and everything else,

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:33.836
into makers of smart things,

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.404
enable them to do that.

00:05:37.207 --> 00:05:42.129
So to test this challenge, we came up
with a very simple idea and challenge:

00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:45.968
Can a tailor make a wearable?

00:05:46.603 --> 00:05:48.348
Now we don't want to take a tailor

00:05:48.372 --> 00:05:50.717
and turn the tailor
into an electrical engineer.

00:05:51.182 --> 00:05:53.333
We still want to have some tailors around.

00:05:54.214 --> 00:05:56.555
But what we would like to do
is create technology

00:05:56.579 --> 00:06:02.456
which looks, feels and behaves
like a raw material used by the tailor

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.015
to make their clothes.

00:06:06.791 --> 00:06:10.935
For example, a touch panel
made for a tailor would look like this,

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:14.718
made out of textiles, so you can cut it
with scissors and sew it in.

00:06:15.618 --> 00:06:18.000
At the same time,
it has to retain the performance.

00:06:18.024 --> 00:06:20.680
The way to make this textile touch panel

00:06:20.704 --> 00:06:24.371
also requires a very different approach
than for making consumer electronics.

00:06:24.395 --> 00:06:27.125
In our case, we have to go
to the mountains of Tokyo

00:06:28.109 --> 00:06:31.339
to a small factory which was making
kimono garments for generations.

00:06:31.799 --> 00:06:34.267
We worked with my collaborators,

00:06:34.291 --> 00:06:36.063
who were not engineers.

00:06:36.806 --> 00:06:40.184
It was an artisan who knows
how to make things

00:06:40.208 --> 00:06:43.466
and an artist who knows
how to make things beautiful.

00:06:44.121 --> 00:06:49.042
Working with them, we created
one of the best yarns in the world,

00:06:49.066 --> 00:06:51.508
which consists of thin metallic alloys

00:06:51.532 --> 00:06:54.764
wrapped around with polyester fibers
and cotton fibers.

00:06:54.788 --> 00:06:57.249
These yarns were made in the same machines

00:06:57.273 --> 00:07:00.605
which were making yarns
for kimonos for generations.

00:07:01.374 --> 00:07:03.953
We then took these yarns
and gave them to the factory,

00:07:03.977 --> 00:07:05.865
which is making textiles,

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:09.310
and we wove our smart textile
using regular machines

00:07:09.334 --> 00:07:11.215
in a variety of colors and materials,

00:07:11.239 --> 00:07:14.345
and we gave those textiles to a tailor

00:07:14.369 --> 00:07:16.389
in Savile Row in London.

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:20.937
So tailors are traditionalists,
particularly in Savile Row.

00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:22.310
They don't use computers.

00:07:23.093 --> 00:07:25.796
They don't use machines.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.559
They use hands and they cut.

00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:29.686
They fit their products on the human body,

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:31.272
not on 3-D avatars.

00:07:33.084 --> 00:07:35.267
Technology is not
a part of their vocabulary,

00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:37.164
but they are modern people.

00:07:37.188 --> 00:07:39.283
They know how to use technology.

00:07:39.307 --> 00:07:41.593
So if technology can be formed and shaped

00:07:41.617 --> 00:07:44.990
like a button, like a textile,
like something they can use,

00:07:45.014 --> 00:07:47.554
they absolutely can make a wearable,

00:07:47.578 --> 00:07:50.546
a garment which can place a phone call.

00:07:50.967 --> 00:07:52.514
(Phone rings)

00:07:53.489 --> 00:07:56.363
So now we've proven
that you can actually make a wearable,

00:07:56.387 --> 00:08:00.894
not by an electronic company,
but by a tailor.

00:08:00.918 --> 00:08:03.750
We worked and collaborated with Levi's,

00:08:03.774 --> 00:08:06.756
our partners and our neighbors,

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.453
to make a real product,

00:08:08.477 --> 00:08:11.283
and this product is this jacket
I'm wearing right now.

00:08:12.381 --> 00:08:14.468
You can buy it. It's on sale.

00:08:14.492 --> 00:08:18.731
It was made in the same factories
which make all their products,

00:08:18.755 --> 00:08:20.049
and you have noticed

00:08:20.073 --> 00:08:23.894
I've been controlling my presentation
from the sleeve of the jacket.

00:08:23.918 --> 00:08:27.064
I go like this, it goes forward.
Like this, it goes backward.

00:08:28.905 --> 00:08:30.650
And of course, I can do more things.

00:08:30.674 --> 00:08:32.579
It's not just to control a presentation.

00:08:32.603 --> 00:08:35.849
I can now control my navigation,
control my music,

00:08:35.873 --> 00:08:39.870
but most importantly,
it stays a jacket, it stays a thing,

00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:42.493
which makes me look great.

00:08:42.517 --> 00:08:44.538
(Laughter)

00:08:44.562 --> 00:08:49.101
(Applause)

00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:51.601
And that's the most important thing.

00:08:51.625 --> 00:08:54.886
(Laughter)

00:08:55.425 --> 00:08:58.332
So OK, we proved we can turn
things into interfaces.

00:08:58.356 --> 00:09:02.355
We proved that these things
can be made by makers of things

00:09:02.379 --> 00:09:03.975
and not by technology companies.

00:09:03.999 --> 00:09:06.038
I look awesome. Are we done?

00:09:06.062 --> 00:09:07.292
(Laughter)

00:09:07.316 --> 00:09:08.474
Not yet.

00:09:08.498 --> 00:09:10.031
The third challenge:

00:09:10.055 --> 00:09:12.225
How can we scale?

00:09:12.249 --> 00:09:15.474
How can we go from one product
to many products?

00:09:15.498 --> 00:09:17.512
And that's what
we're working on right now.

00:09:17.536 --> 00:09:19.631
Let me tell you
how we're going to do this.

00:09:19.655 --> 00:09:21.718
First of all, I want
to make myself clear --

00:09:21.742 --> 00:09:24.399
I am not talking about
the Internet of Things.

00:09:24.423 --> 00:09:27.852
I'm not talking about
creating another gadget

00:09:27.876 --> 00:09:30.764
you get bored with and throw
in the back of your drawer

00:09:30.788 --> 00:09:31.939
and forget about.

00:09:31.963 --> 00:09:36.383
I am talking about the foundational,
important principle which guides my work:

00:09:36.693 --> 00:09:40.732
"Technology has to make
existing things better."

00:09:41.299 --> 00:09:46.089
It makes them better
by connecting them to your digital life

00:09:46.113 --> 00:09:50.163
and adds new usefulness
and new functionality

00:09:50.187 --> 00:09:52.656
while remaining the same original purpose,

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.862
not changing it.

00:09:54.824 --> 00:09:59.193
This jacket I am wearing can control
my mobile phone and presentation,

00:10:00.084 --> 00:10:01.560
but it still remains a jacket.

00:10:02.828 --> 00:10:07.941
That means that once we start making
all things interactive and connected,

00:10:07.965 --> 00:10:12.083
every thing would have its own set
of actuators, displays and sensors

00:10:12.107 --> 00:10:14.190
specific for those things.

00:10:14.214 --> 00:10:17.073
A pair of running shoes
does not need to have a touch sensor.

00:10:17.097 --> 00:10:18.921
Why would it have one?

00:10:18.945 --> 00:10:20.278
If you have a sensor,

00:10:20.302 --> 00:10:22.357
it should measure your running performance

00:10:22.381 --> 00:10:23.532
or knee impact,

00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:25.645
while remaining a great pair of shoes.

00:10:26.309 --> 00:10:29.364
Makers of things
will have to start thinking

00:10:29.388 --> 00:10:34.143
what kind of digital functionality
they have to offer to their consumers.

00:10:35.002 --> 00:10:37.897
They will have to become
service providers,

00:10:38.755 --> 00:10:40.271
or they may become irrelevant.

00:10:41.262 --> 00:10:44.763
We will have to provide and create
a service ecosystem

00:10:44.787 --> 00:10:46.921
just like we've done for mobile phones,

00:10:46.945 --> 00:10:49.421
where you have apps and services
and everything else,

00:10:49.445 --> 00:10:51.762
and sometimes,
you're still making a phone call.

00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:56.437
Now to make this ecosystem possible,
we have to avoid fragmentation.

00:10:56.461 --> 00:11:00.319
We have to avoid different interfaces
for different people for different things.

00:11:00.343 --> 00:11:02.430
We have to create uniform user experience

00:11:02.454 --> 00:11:06.832
and, for that reason, we have to create
a single computing platform

00:11:06.856 --> 00:11:08.777
which powers all those things.

00:11:08.801 --> 00:11:10.681
What is the platform going to be?

00:11:10.705 --> 00:11:12.417
And I think the answer is obvious:

00:11:12.441 --> 00:11:15.318
it's a cloud, cloud computing.

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:18.442
Now you cannot connect things
directly to the cloud, obviously.

00:11:18.466 --> 00:11:23.896
So you have to develop a small device
which can be plugged into all the things

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.636
and make them connected to the cloud

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.299
to unlock their potential
and add new functionality.

00:11:29.323 --> 00:11:33.113
So let me show, for the first time,
the real device which we've built.

00:11:33.137 --> 00:11:35.692
We are showing this for the first time.

00:11:35.716 --> 00:11:37.032
That's what it looks like,

00:11:38.223 --> 00:11:39.373
and it's a small device

00:11:39.397 --> 00:11:43.549
which will be connected
to things we want to make smart

00:11:43.573 --> 00:11:45.007
and connected and interactive.

00:11:45.031 --> 00:11:46.182
How is it going to work?

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:50.294
So on the back, you have a few electrodes.

00:11:50.318 --> 00:11:53.318
So when you plug them
into different things,

00:11:53.342 --> 00:11:54.995
like here,

00:11:55.019 --> 00:11:57.790
the device will recognize
where you're plugging them

00:11:57.814 --> 00:12:01.791
and then reconfigure itself
to enable specific functionality

00:12:01.815 --> 00:12:03.995
for this particular thing.

00:12:04.019 --> 00:12:06.575
We would like to give this device
to makers of things,

00:12:06.599 --> 00:12:08.926
the people who make
your clothing and furniture,

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:12.924
so they can use it just like they use
a button or a zipper.

00:12:13.239 --> 00:12:15.811
And what they're going
to make with them is up to them.

00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:17.733
We don't want to dictate the use cases.

00:12:17.757 --> 00:12:20.882
We would like to let
people who make those things --

00:12:20.906 --> 00:12:24.247
artists and designers,
brands and craftsmen --

00:12:24.271 --> 00:12:27.469
to imagine and create this new world

00:12:27.493 --> 00:12:29.389
where things are connected

00:12:29.413 --> 00:12:32.124
and have all this new,
exciting digital functionality.

00:12:32.148 --> 00:12:37.319
We don't need keyboards and screens
and mouses to interact with your computer.

00:12:37.886 --> 00:12:40.441
So I've been working
on this idea for 20 years,

00:12:40.465 --> 00:12:42.108
and now it's taking shape,

00:12:42.132 --> 00:12:44.956
and as it's taking shape,
what we are realizing

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:47.901
is that I always thought
I was working on computer interfaces,

00:12:47.925 --> 00:12:50.449
I always thought of myself
as an interaction designer,

00:12:50.473 --> 00:12:54.211
but I'm realizing
that I'm not building interfaces.

00:12:54.235 --> 00:12:57.239
What I realized is that me and my team,

00:12:58.861 --> 00:13:01.160
we're building a new kind of computer,

00:13:01.184 --> 00:13:02.879
an ambient computer.

00:13:02.903 --> 00:13:04.054
Thank you.

00:13:04.078 --> 00:13:10.333
(Applause)
