00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.333
So, asking for help
is basically the worst, right?

00:00:18.357 --> 00:00:22.309
I've actually never seen it
on one of those top ten lists

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.008
of things people fear,

00:00:24.032 --> 00:00:26.135
like public speaking

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.831
and death,

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:30.456
but I'm pretty sure
it actually belongs there.

00:00:31.146 --> 00:00:36.022
Even though in many ways it's foolish
for us to be afraid to admit we need help,

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:40.780
whether it's from a loved one
or a friend or from a coworker

00:00:40.804 --> 00:00:42.787
or even from a stranger,

00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:47.943
somehow it always feel just a little bit
uncomfortable and embarrassing

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:50.010
to actually ask for help,

00:00:50.034 --> 00:00:53.236
which is, of course, why most of us
try to avoid asking for help

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.911
whenever humanly possible.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.832
My father was one of those
legions of fathers

00:00:58.856 --> 00:01:04.239
who, I swear, would rather drive
through an alligator-infested swamp

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:07.669
than actually ask someone for help
getting back to the road.

00:01:07.693 --> 00:01:10.787
When I was a kid,
we took a family vacation.

00:01:10.811 --> 00:01:14.473
We drove from our home in South Jersey
to Colonial Williamsburg.

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.703
And I remember we got really badly lost.

00:01:17.727 --> 00:01:20.278
My mother and I pleaded with him

00:01:20.302 --> 00:01:24.797
to please just pull over and ask someone
for directions back to the highway,

00:01:24.821 --> 00:01:26.954
and he absolutely refused,

00:01:26.978 --> 00:01:29.886
and, in fact, assured us
that we were not lost,

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.878
he had just always wanted to know
what was over here.

00:01:32.902 --> 00:01:34.867
(Laughter)

00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:37.261
So if we're going to ask for help --

00:01:37.285 --> 00:01:41.825
and we have to, we all do,
practically every day --

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:45.031
the only way we're going to even begin
to get comfortable with it

00:01:45.055 --> 00:01:46.924
is to get good at it,

00:01:46.948 --> 00:01:50.495
to actually increase the chances
that when you ask for help from someone,

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:52.860
they're actually going to say yes.

00:01:52.884 --> 00:01:56.274
And not only that, but they're going
to find it actually satisfying

00:01:56.298 --> 00:01:57.948
and rewarding to help you,

00:01:57.972 --> 00:02:02.217
because that way, they'll be motivated
to continue to help you into the future.

00:02:02.902 --> 00:02:05.519
So research that I
and some of my colleagues have done

00:02:05.543 --> 00:02:09.580
has shed a lot of light on why it is
that sometimes people say yes

00:02:09.604 --> 00:02:10.938
to our requests for help

00:02:10.962 --> 00:02:13.064
and why sometimes they say no.

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:16.494
Now let me just start by saying right now:

00:02:16.518 --> 00:02:18.064
if you need help,

00:02:18.088 --> 00:02:21.241
you are going to have to ask for it.

00:02:21.265 --> 00:02:22.541
Out loud.

00:02:22.565 --> 00:02:23.718
OK?

00:02:23.742 --> 00:02:27.044
We all, to some extent, suffer
from something that psychologists call

00:02:27.068 --> 00:02:29.331
"the illusion of transparency" --

00:02:29.355 --> 00:02:31.025
basically, the mistaken belief

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.948
that our thoughts
and our feelings and our needs

00:02:33.972 --> 00:02:36.359
are really obvious to other people.

00:02:37.348 --> 00:02:39.198
This is not true, but we believe it.

00:02:39.222 --> 00:02:43.257
And so, we just mostly stand around
waiting for someone to notice our needs

00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:46.214
and then spontaneously offer
to help us with it.

00:02:46.238 --> 00:02:48.717
This is a really, really bad assumption.

00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:52.399
In fact, not only is it very difficult
to tell what your needs are,

00:02:52.423 --> 00:02:55.720
but even the people close to you
often struggle to understand

00:02:55.744 --> 00:02:57.793
how they can support you.

00:02:57.817 --> 00:03:00.496
My partner has actually
had to adopt a habit

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.248
of asking me multiple times a day,

00:03:03.272 --> 00:03:05.274
"Are you OK? Do you need anything?"

00:03:05.298 --> 00:03:10.061
because I am so, so bad at signaling
when I need someone's help.

00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:12.645
Now, he is more patient than I deserve

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:16.451
and much more proactive,
much more, about helping

00:03:16.475 --> 00:03:19.572
than any of us have any right
to expect other people to be.

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.956
So if you need help, you're going
to have to ask for it.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.400
And by the way, even when someone
can tell that you need help,

00:03:26.424 --> 00:03:28.573
how do they know that you want it?

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.955
Did you ever try to give unsolicited help
to someone who, it turns out,

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.416
did not actually want your help
in the first place?

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.260
They get nasty real quick, don't they?

00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:40.860
The other day -- true story --

00:03:40.884 --> 00:03:43.309
my teenage daughter
was getting dressed for school,

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:46.390
and I decided to give her
some unsolicited help about that.

00:03:46.414 --> 00:03:47.444
(Laughter)

00:03:47.468 --> 00:03:50.428
I happen to think she looks amazing
in brighter colors.

00:03:50.452 --> 00:03:54.183
She tends to prefer sort of darker,
more neutral tones.

00:03:54.207 --> 00:03:56.644
And so I said, very helpfully,

00:03:56.668 --> 00:03:59.200
that I thought maybe
she could go back upstairs

00:03:59.224 --> 00:04:02.147
and try to find something
a little less somber.

00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:04.119
(Laughter)

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:06.891
So, if looks could kill,

00:04:06.915 --> 00:04:09.341
I would not be standing here right now.

00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:14.595
We really can't blame other people for not
just spontaneously offering to help us

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:17.814
when we don't actually know
that that's what is wanted.

00:04:17.838 --> 00:04:19.592
In fact, actually, research shows

00:04:19.616 --> 00:04:24.219
that 90 percent of the help that coworkers
give one another in the workplace

00:04:24.243 --> 00:04:28.028
is in response
to explicit requests for help.

00:04:28.052 --> 00:04:31.483
So you're going to have to say
the words "I need your help." Right?

00:04:31.507 --> 00:04:33.134
There's no getting around it.

00:04:33.158 --> 00:04:34.396
Now, to be good at it,

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.621
to make sure that people actually do
help you when you ask for it,

00:04:37.645 --> 00:04:41.023
there are a few other things
that are very helpful to keep in mind.

00:04:41.047 --> 00:04:44.099
First thing: when you ask for help,

00:04:44.123 --> 00:04:49.020
be very, very specific
about the help you want and why.

00:04:49.718 --> 00:04:53.300
Vague, sort of indirect requests for help

00:04:53.324 --> 00:04:56.487
actually aren't very helpful
to the helper, right?

00:04:56.511 --> 00:04:59.524
We don't actually know
what it is you want from us,

00:04:59.548 --> 00:05:01.204
and, just as important,

00:05:01.228 --> 00:05:03.869
we don't know whether or not
we can be successful

00:05:03.893 --> 00:05:05.077
in giving you the help.

00:05:05.101 --> 00:05:07.004
Nobody wants to give bad help.

00:05:07.512 --> 00:05:10.379
Like me, you probably get
some of these requests

00:05:10.403 --> 00:05:13.660
from perfectly pleasant
strangers on LinkedIn

00:05:13.684 --> 00:05:18.632
who want to do things like
"get together over coffee and connect"

00:05:18.656 --> 00:05:20.756
or "pick your brain."

00:05:21.327 --> 00:05:24.743
I ignore these requests
literally every time.

00:05:24.767 --> 00:05:26.962
And it's not that I'm not a nice person.

00:05:26.986 --> 00:05:29.883
It's just that when I don't know
what it is you want from me,

00:05:29.907 --> 00:05:32.666
like the kind of help
you're hoping that can I provide,

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.326
I'm not interested.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.705
Nobody is.

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.068
I'd have been much more interested
if they had just come out and said

00:05:39.092 --> 00:05:41.541
whatever it is was
they were hoping to get from me,

00:05:41.565 --> 00:05:44.465
because I'm pretty sure they had
something specific in mind.

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:45.659
So go ahead and say,

00:05:45.683 --> 00:05:48.767
"I'm hoping to discuss opportunities
to work in your company,"

00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:51.772
or, "I'd like to propose
a joint research project

00:05:51.796 --> 00:05:54.341
in an area I know you're interested in,"

00:05:54.365 --> 00:05:57.653
or, "I'd like your advice
on getting into medical school."

00:05:58.343 --> 00:06:00.643
Technically, I can't help you
with that last one

00:06:00.667 --> 00:06:02.414
because I'm not that kind of doctor,

00:06:02.438 --> 00:06:05.617
but I could point you in the direction
of someone who could.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.849
OK, second tip.

00:06:07.873 --> 00:06:09.149
This is really important:

00:06:10.054 --> 00:06:14.682
please avoid disclaimers,
apologies and bribes.

00:06:15.214 --> 00:06:16.460
Really, really important.

00:06:16.484 --> 00:06:18.606
Do any of these sound familiar?

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:19.882
(Clears throat)

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:25.313
'I'm so, so sorry
that I have to ask you for this."

00:06:25.337 --> 00:06:28.820
"I really hate bothering you with this."

00:06:28.844 --> 00:06:34.156
"If I had any way of doing this
without your help, I would."

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.203
(Laughter)

00:06:35.227 --> 00:06:38.351
Sometimes it feels like people
are so eager to prove

00:06:38.375 --> 00:06:41.488
that they're not weak and greedy
when they ask your for help,

00:06:41.512 --> 00:06:44.347
they're completely missing out
on how uncomfortable

00:06:44.371 --> 00:06:45.929
they're making you feel.

00:06:45.953 --> 00:06:49.300
And by the way -- how am I supposed
to find it satisfying to help you

00:06:49.324 --> 00:06:52.356
if you really hated
having to ask me for help?

00:06:53.198 --> 00:06:56.155
And while it is perfectly,
perfectly acceptable

00:06:56.179 --> 00:06:59.602
to pay strangers to do things for you,

00:06:59.626 --> 00:07:03.511
you need to be very, very careful
when it comes to incentivizing

00:07:03.535 --> 00:07:05.743
your friends and coworkers.

00:07:05.767 --> 00:07:07.864
When you have a relationship with someone,

00:07:07.888 --> 00:07:11.280
helping one another is actually
a natural part of that relationship.

00:07:11.304 --> 00:07:13.912
It's how we show one another that we care.

00:07:13.936 --> 00:07:17.588
If you introduce incentives
or payments into that,

00:07:17.612 --> 00:07:21.288
what can happen is, it starts to feel
like it isn't a relationship,

00:07:21.312 --> 00:07:22.676
it's a transaction.

00:07:23.128 --> 00:07:25.672
And that actually
is experienced as distancing,

00:07:25.696 --> 00:07:29.678
which, ironically, makes people
less likely to help you.

00:07:29.702 --> 00:07:31.650
So a spontaneous gift

00:07:31.674 --> 00:07:35.515
after someone gives you some help
to show your appreciation and gratitude --

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:37.019
perfectly fine.

00:07:37.043 --> 00:07:40.978
An offer to pay your best friend
to help you move into your new apartment

00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:42.216
is not.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.067
OK, third rule,

00:07:44.091 --> 00:07:45.801
and I really mean this one:

00:07:45.825 --> 00:07:48.503
please do not ask for help

00:07:48.527 --> 00:07:50.819
over email or text.

00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:53.964
Really, seriously, please don't.

00:07:53.988 --> 00:07:56.182
Email and text are impersonal.

00:07:56.206 --> 00:07:58.972
I realize sometimes
there's no alternative,

00:07:58.996 --> 00:08:01.488
but mostly what happens is,

00:08:01.512 --> 00:08:04.485
we like to ask for help
over email and text

00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:08.026
because it feels less awkward
for us to do so.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.475
You know what else feels
less awkward over email and text?

00:08:12.499 --> 00:08:14.313
Telling you no.

00:08:14.337 --> 00:08:17.190
And it turns out, there's
research to support this.

00:08:17.214 --> 00:08:22.956
In-person requests for help
are 30 times more likely to get a yes

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.846
than a request made by email.

00:08:25.313 --> 00:08:28.831
So when something is really important
and you really need someone's help,

00:08:28.855 --> 00:08:31.679
make face time to make the request,

00:08:31.703 --> 00:08:34.843
or use your phone as a phone --

00:08:34.867 --> 00:08:36.707
(Laughter)

00:08:36.731 --> 00:08:39.055
to ask for the help that you need.

00:08:39.079 --> 00:08:40.261
OK.

00:08:40.775 --> 00:08:44.501
Last one, and this is actually
a really, really important one

00:08:44.525 --> 00:08:46.617
and probably the one
that is most overlooked

00:08:46.641 --> 00:08:48.277
when it comes to asking for help:

00:08:48.301 --> 00:08:51.409
when you ask someone
for their help and they say yes,

00:08:51.433 --> 00:08:53.641
follow up with them afterward.

00:08:54.109 --> 00:08:57.858
There's a common misconception
that what's rewarding about helping

00:08:57.882 --> 00:09:00.225
is the act of helping itself.

00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:01.667
This is not true.

00:09:01.691 --> 00:09:05.804
What is rewarding about helping
is knowing that your help landed,

00:09:05.828 --> 00:09:07.256
that it had impact,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.940
that you were effective.

00:09:09.358 --> 00:09:13.096
If I have no idea
how my help affected you,

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.802
how am I supposed to feel about it?

00:09:14.826 --> 00:09:17.652
This happened; I was a university
professor for many years,

00:09:17.676 --> 00:09:20.100
I wrote lots and lots
of letters of recommendation

00:09:20.124 --> 00:09:22.883
for people to get jobs
or to go into graduate school.

00:09:22.907 --> 00:09:25.218
And probably about 95 percent of them,

00:09:25.242 --> 00:09:27.323
I have no idea what happened.

00:09:27.347 --> 00:09:30.902
Now, how do I feel about the time
and effort I took to do that,

00:09:30.926 --> 00:09:33.479
when I really have no idea
if I helped you,

00:09:33.503 --> 00:09:36.383
if it actually helped you
get the thing that you wanted?

00:09:36.407 --> 00:09:38.946
In fact, this idea of feeling effective

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:44.604
is part of why certain kinds
of donor appeals are so, so persuasive --

00:09:44.628 --> 00:09:47.359
because they allow you
to really vividly imagine

00:09:47.383 --> 00:09:49.545
the effect that your help
is going to have.

00:09:49.569 --> 00:09:52.044
Take something like DonorsChoose.

00:09:52.068 --> 00:09:55.696
You go online, you can choose
the individual teacher by name

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.212
whose classroom you're going
to be able to help

00:09:58.236 --> 00:10:01.428
by literally buying the specific
items they've requested,

00:10:01.452 --> 00:10:05.724
like microscopes or laptops
or flexible seating.

00:10:05.748 --> 00:10:09.195
An appeal like that makes it
so easy for me to imagine

00:10:09.219 --> 00:10:10.767
the good that my money will do,

00:10:10.791 --> 00:10:13.398
that I actually get
an immediate sense of effectiveness

00:10:13.422 --> 00:10:15.294
the minute I commit to giving.

00:10:15.318 --> 00:10:16.849
But you know what else they do?

00:10:16.873 --> 00:10:18.475
They follow up.

00:10:18.499 --> 00:10:22.024
Donors actually get letters
from the kids in the classroom.

00:10:22.048 --> 00:10:23.524
They get pictures.

00:10:23.548 --> 00:10:26.041
They get to know
that they made a difference.

00:10:26.065 --> 00:10:29.332
And this is something we need
to all be doing in our everyday lives,

00:10:29.356 --> 00:10:32.425
especially if we want people
to continue to give us help

00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:33.825
over the long term.

00:10:34.341 --> 00:10:37.718
Take time to tell your colleague
that the help that they gave you

00:10:37.742 --> 00:10:39.802
really helped you land that big sale,

00:10:39.826 --> 00:10:43.289
or helped you get that interview
that you were really hoping to get.

00:10:43.313 --> 00:10:46.470
Take time to tell your partner
that the support they gave you

00:10:46.494 --> 00:10:49.404
really made it possible for you
to get through a tough time.

00:10:50.096 --> 00:10:52.429
Take time to tell your catsitter

00:10:52.453 --> 00:10:55.352
that you're super happy
that for some reason,

00:10:55.376 --> 00:10:58.505
this time the cats didn't break
anything while you were away,

00:10:58.529 --> 00:11:01.160
and so they must have done
a really good job.

00:11:02.149 --> 00:11:03.500
The bottom line is:

00:11:03.524 --> 00:11:05.961
I know -- believe me, I know --

00:11:05.985 --> 00:11:08.467
that it is not easy to ask for help.

00:11:09.348 --> 00:11:11.426
We are all a little bit afraid to do it.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.286
It makes us feel vulnerable.

00:11:13.921 --> 00:11:17.994
But the reality of modern work
and modern life

00:11:18.018 --> 00:11:20.348
is that nobody does it alone.

00:11:20.372 --> 00:11:22.375
Nobody succeeds in a vacuum.

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:26.471
More than ever, we actually do
have to rely on other people,

00:11:26.495 --> 00:11:30.214
on their support and collaboration,
in order to be successful.

00:11:30.993 --> 00:11:35.148
So when you need help,
ask for it out loud.

00:11:35.172 --> 00:11:38.430
And when you do, do it in a way
that increases your chances

00:11:38.454 --> 00:11:39.944
that you'll get a yes

00:11:39.968 --> 00:11:44.530
and makes the other person
feel awesome for having helped you,

00:11:44.554 --> 00:11:46.116
because you both deserve it.

00:11:46.604 --> 00:11:47.882
Thank you.

00:11:47.906 --> 00:11:50.641
(Applause)
