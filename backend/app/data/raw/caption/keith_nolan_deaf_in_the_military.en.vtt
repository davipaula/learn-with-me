00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:14.412
(Interpreter voice-over) Hello, everyone.
My name is Keith Nolan.

00:00:14.944 --> 00:00:16.451
I’m a cadet private.

00:00:19.668 --> 00:00:22.863
My talk today is on the topic
of the military.

00:00:23.457 --> 00:00:27.026
How many of you out there thought
you’d ever like to join the military?

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.992
I see a number of you nodding.

00:00:29.016 --> 00:00:31.691
And I thought the same thing
ever since I was young.

00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:34.464
Growing up, I’d always wanted
to join the military.

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:36.976
I loved military history

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.459
and I’ve read a great deal on the subject.

00:00:39.483 --> 00:00:43.730
Also, I have various family members,
such as my grandfather and great uncle,

00:00:43.754 --> 00:00:45.068
who fought in World War II.

00:00:45.092 --> 00:00:48.473
And like them, I wanted the same thing:
to serve my country.

00:00:48.497 --> 00:00:50.084
So the question is: Can I?

00:00:50.108 --> 00:00:51.362
No, I can’t.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.775
Why? Simply because I’m deaf.

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.413
Regardless of that fact, I still had
that longing to join the military.

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:03.901
For example, after I graduated
from high school,

00:01:03.925 --> 00:01:06.268
three months before 9/11 occurred,

00:01:06.292 --> 00:01:10.409
I went to a naval recruiting center
with high hopes of joining the navy.

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:14.353
I went in and a strapping naval man
stood up and addressed me.

00:01:14.377 --> 00:01:18.556
As he was speaking to me,
it was impossible for me to read his lips,

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.242
so I said, “I'm sorry, I’m deaf.”

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.603
He tore off a little piece of paper
and wrote down three words:

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:27.707
“Bad ear. Disqual.”

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:30.609
He didn't even fully
spell out "Disqualified,"

00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:32.356
just: “Bad ear. Disqual.”

00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:35.993
So I went on my way.

00:01:36.017 --> 00:01:39.738
I tried various locations a number
of different times, trying to join,

00:01:39.762 --> 00:01:42.285
but over and over again,
I got the same response:

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:44.462
“Sorry, you’re deaf. We can’t accept you.”

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.385
So I shifted gears
and decided to become a teacher.

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.436
I completed a master's in deaf education
and taught for almost two years,

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.920
until this past spring,
when three things occurred

00:01:53.944 --> 00:01:55.585
that changed that course,

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:59.414
the first of which, while I was teaching
a high school history class.

00:01:59.438 --> 00:02:01.812
I’d lectured on the Mexican-American War.

00:02:01.836 --> 00:02:04.283
The bell had rung,
and I was seated at my desk,

00:02:04.307 --> 00:02:07.087
when one of my students,
who is deaf, approached me

00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:09.270
and said that he’d like
to join the military.

00:02:09.294 --> 00:02:11.447
I said, “Ah, sorry.
You can’t. You're deaf.”

00:02:12.026 --> 00:02:13.478
Then I caught myself.

00:02:13.502 --> 00:02:16.841
It struck me that all along
I had been told no, I can’t,

00:02:16.865 --> 00:02:19.024
and now I was perpetuating
that same message

00:02:19.048 --> 00:02:21.713
to the next generation, to my own student.

00:02:21.737 --> 00:02:25.431
That realization had a large impact
that really resonated with me.

00:02:25.455 --> 00:02:28.934
Now, the second thing that happened,
my friend had just moved to Israel.

00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.325
Did you know that in Israel
they accept deaf people into the military?

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.515
How can deaf people be
in the military, right?

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:36.645
Could this really be true? Come on!

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.789
Well, I went to Israel last summer
to see for myself.

00:02:39.813 --> 00:02:42.672
I interviewed 10 deaf Israeli soldiers,

00:02:42.696 --> 00:02:45.458
all of those video interviews
and questions I’ve compiled,

00:02:45.482 --> 00:02:47.666
and the findings,
I’ll share with you later.

00:02:48.341 --> 00:02:51.251
Thirdly, CSUN here, my alma mater,

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:54.182
had recently started up
an Army ROTC program.

00:02:54.914 --> 00:02:59.767
ROTC, which stands for
Reserve Officer Training Corps,

00:02:59.791 --> 00:03:02.091
allows students working on
their college majors

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:04.736
to concurrently participate
in the ROTC program.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.225
Upon graduation, ROTC students
have a military career

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:09.869
ready and waiting for them.

00:03:09.893 --> 00:03:13.333
So if one joined the army, one could
commission as a second lieutenant.

00:03:13.357 --> 00:03:15.741
That's generally the ROTC
program here at CSUN.

00:03:16.217 --> 00:03:18.174
Having learned that, I was intrigued.

00:03:18.628 --> 00:03:20.650
I already had a profession as a teacher,

00:03:20.674 --> 00:03:23.627
but I went ahead anyway
and sent an email off to the program,

00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:25.784
explaining that I was
a teacher of the deaf,

00:03:25.808 --> 00:03:28.141
wondering if I could take
a few classes with them

00:03:28.165 --> 00:03:30.813
and perhaps share their lessons
with my students.

00:03:30.837 --> 00:03:32.585
I got an email response back,

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:36.189
and surprisingly, it was the first
time that I wasn't told,

00:03:36.213 --> 00:03:38.370
"Sorry, no, you can’t. You’re deaf."

00:03:38.394 --> 00:03:40.419
It said, "Well, that's interesting.

00:03:40.443 --> 00:03:42.363
I think maybe we can work something out

00:03:42.387 --> 00:03:44.488
and you can take a few classes with us."

00:03:45.111 --> 00:03:46.578
This was unprecedented.

00:03:47.113 --> 00:03:49.063
So naturally, I was shocked.

00:03:49.087 --> 00:03:52.726
Although I was teaching, I decided I had
to grab the opportunity right away

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.108
and get my foot in the door.

00:03:54.132 --> 00:03:55.982
Altogether, that's how it transpired.

00:03:56.752 --> 00:03:59.006
Now, with all my life experiences,

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.753
having talked with all the people I had,
and given everything I’ve read,

00:04:02.777 --> 00:04:06.563
I decided to write a research paper
called “Deaf in the Military.”

00:04:06.587 --> 00:04:09.206
I'll share with you
what those 98 pages entail.

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.375
Here in America, we’ve actually had
deaf soldiers serving in the past.

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:18.276
In fact, during
the Texas War of Independence,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.323
there was a key character
named Deaf Smith,

00:04:20.347 --> 00:04:22.818
who made a large contribution
to that war effort.

00:04:23.484 --> 00:04:25.061
For the American Civil War,

00:04:25.085 --> 00:04:29.177
Gallaudet University actually has archived
a list of deaf soldiers in that war

00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:30.891
from the North and the South,

00:04:30.915 --> 00:04:34.042
showing that deaf soldiers
were even fighting against each other.

00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:36.892
During World War II,
there are a few rare examples

00:04:36.916 --> 00:04:39.766
of deaf people who made it
into the military at that time

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.039
and were able to serve
their country as well.

00:04:42.063 --> 00:04:45.142
History illustrates the fact
that America has had deaf soldiers,

00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:46.446
in contrast to today.

00:04:46.776 --> 00:04:50.144
In my paper, I also discuss
the deaf Israeli soldiers.

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:53.405
I learned that they serve
in non-combat roles.

00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:56.467
The deaf soldiers are not
on the front lines engaged in fire,

00:04:56.491 --> 00:04:59.741
but rather, are behind the lines
serving in supportive roles.

00:04:59.765 --> 00:05:03.233
There are a plethora of various
non-combat jobs accessible to the deaf:

00:05:03.257 --> 00:05:06.663
intelligence, computer technology,
map drawing, supply,

00:05:06.687 --> 00:05:07.933
military dog training --

00:05:07.957 --> 00:05:09.131
the list goes on.

00:05:09.916 --> 00:05:12.150
The communication
between deaf Israeli soldiers

00:05:12.174 --> 00:05:13.833
and other soldiers who are hearing

00:05:13.857 --> 00:05:17.040
is carried out with the same approaches
deaf people in general use

00:05:17.064 --> 00:05:19.028
with the hearing public on a daily basis.

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:21.143
You can use your voice,
lip-read, gestures,

00:05:21.167 --> 00:05:24.591
sometimes another soldier knows
sign language and that can be utilized,

00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:27.808
pen and paper, texts, computers, emails --

00:05:27.832 --> 00:05:30.134
seriously, there’s no
magic wand necessary.

00:05:30.158 --> 00:05:31.995
It's the same thing we do every day.

00:05:32.395 --> 00:05:35.569
Interpreters are used there primarily
for boot camp training.

00:05:35.593 --> 00:05:39.362
For the average work, it’s not necessary
to have an interpreter by your side.

00:05:39.386 --> 00:05:41.784
The Israeli Army is comprised
of small groups.

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:44.343
Each of these units with deaf
soldiers have developed

00:05:44.367 --> 00:05:46.594
their own way of communicating
with each other,

00:05:46.618 --> 00:05:48.406
so there’s no need for interpreters.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.028
The top picture is of one soldier I met.

00:05:52.052 --> 00:05:54.294
The bottom photo
is of Prime Minister Begin

00:05:54.318 --> 00:05:56.146
with a deaf soldier in Israel.

00:05:58.415 --> 00:06:02.789
Another part of my paper touches on
disabled soldiers in the US Military.

00:06:02.813 --> 00:06:06.451
Obviously, military work can be dangerous
and involve injury.

00:06:06.475 --> 00:06:09.386
One example here is Captain Luckett.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.985
Due to an explosion, he lost his leg.

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:14.851
He’s recovered and currently has
a prosthetic leg.

00:06:15.535 --> 00:06:20.758
Now that he’s strong, he's back in combat,
still fighting in Afghanistan.

00:06:21.313 --> 00:06:22.757
It’s remarkable.

00:06:22.781 --> 00:06:25.465
And guess what? He’s not the only one.

00:06:25.489 --> 00:06:27.678
There are 40 other soldiers like him,

00:06:27.702 --> 00:06:31.083
amputees who are serving in combat zones.

00:06:31.107 --> 00:06:32.267
Incredible.

00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:34.405
Also, we have a blind soldier here.

00:06:34.429 --> 00:06:35.833
While he was in Iraq,

00:06:35.857 --> 00:06:40.101
an explosion from a suicide car bomber
destroyed his eyesight.

00:06:40.795 --> 00:06:43.515
He’s recovered and hasn’t left the army.

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:46.065
The army has retained him on active duty,

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:49.307
and he’s currently running a hospital
for wounded soldiers.

00:06:49.331 --> 00:06:51.739
I also found out online
about another soldier,

00:06:51.763 --> 00:06:53.121
who is deaf in one ear.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.914
He’s developed civil programs in Iraq,

00:06:55.938 --> 00:06:59.460
one of which actually started
a school for the deaf in Iraq.

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:03.314
All of this is incredible.

00:07:03.862 --> 00:07:06.116
But I am going to ask all of you:

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.548
If the US Military can retain
their disabled soldiers,

00:07:09.572 --> 00:07:12.372
why can’t they accept
disabled citizens as well?

00:07:15.033 --> 00:07:20.933
Moreover, out of all the US Military jobs,
80% are non-combat positions.

00:07:21.268 --> 00:07:24.941
There are many jobs that we
in the Deaf community can do.

00:07:24.965 --> 00:07:28.305
If I were to be in the military,
I’d like to do intelligence work.

00:07:28.329 --> 00:07:30.593
But there is an array
of other things we can do,

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:33.312
such as mechanics, finance, medicine, etc.

00:07:33.904 --> 00:07:37.596
So to summarize, I’ve presented
three premises to support my argument,

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.177
the first being, Israeli defense
openly accepts deaf soldiers.

00:07:41.201 --> 00:07:44.376
If you have the qualities
and skills required, they’ll take you.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.032
Secondly, the US Military
has accommodations

00:07:47.056 --> 00:07:49.004
for retaining their disabled soldiers.

00:07:49.028 --> 00:07:53.828
And lastly, 80% of occupations
in the military are non-combat.

00:07:54.405 --> 00:07:57.318
Now, can we Deaf Americans
serve our country?

00:07:57.342 --> 00:08:00.152
Yes! Of course!
Absolutely, without a doubt!

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:06.363
Now I’ll explain a bit
about my experience in the Army ROTC,

00:08:06.387 --> 00:08:07.742
which began last fall.

00:08:08.106 --> 00:08:11.431
I have been involved with that thus far
and it’s still going on now.

00:08:11.455 --> 00:08:13.514
Really, I need to preface this

00:08:13.538 --> 00:08:18.273
by saying that this is the first time
my battalion had ever had a deaf cadet.

00:08:18.297 --> 00:08:20.228
They had never experienced that before.

00:08:20.252 --> 00:08:24.420
So of course, they were taken aback,
wondering, initially,

00:08:24.444 --> 00:08:27.667
how I would do this or that,
how would we communicate and such,

00:08:27.691 --> 00:08:29.036
which is a natural reaction,

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.336
considering that many of them
had never interacted with a deaf person

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.511
prior to me.

00:08:33.535 --> 00:08:37.964
Plus, I was taken aback by this --
it was the real thing, the army.

00:08:37.988 --> 00:08:41.190
I had to learn a whole new world,
full of military jargon,

00:08:41.214 --> 00:08:43.282
with its own culture and everything.

00:08:44.634 --> 00:08:47.475
So we started out slow,
getting to know each other

00:08:47.499 --> 00:08:50.575
and learning how
to work together, progressively.

00:08:51.198 --> 00:08:55.263
For example, on the first day
of class, I had no uniform.

00:08:55.287 --> 00:08:56.962
So I showed up in regular clothes,

00:08:56.986 --> 00:08:59.239
while the other cadets
were all in uniform.

00:08:59.263 --> 00:09:04.900
I found out that every morning at 5:30,
there was physical training, PT.

00:09:04.924 --> 00:09:08.610
On Fridays, there would be
field training -- labs -- off-campus,

00:09:08.634 --> 00:09:12.493
and occasionally, we would have
weekend training at a military base.

00:09:12.517 --> 00:09:14.714
So I showed up, ready,
each morning at 5:30,

00:09:14.738 --> 00:09:17.822
with all the cadets in uniform
and me in civilian clothes.

00:09:17.846 --> 00:09:20.563
They told me, “Hey, you know,
you don't need to work out.

00:09:20.587 --> 00:09:22.234
You can just simply take classes.”

00:09:22.258 --> 00:09:23.805
I told them I wanted to, anyway.

00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:27.330
They acknowledged that, and I continued
to show up every morning to train.

00:09:27.354 --> 00:09:30.134
When Friday came,
I asked if I could do the field training.

00:09:30.158 --> 00:09:32.404
I was told no, just stick with class.

00:09:32.428 --> 00:09:34.479
I insisted that I wanted to try.

00:09:34.503 --> 00:09:37.506
Somewhat reluctantly,
they let me attend the lab,

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:38.917
but only as an observer;

00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:42.540
I would only be allowed
to sit and watch, not participate.

00:09:43.028 --> 00:09:44.928
Alright, so, I showed up on Friday,

00:09:44.952 --> 00:09:47.914
and watched as the cadets learned
marching drill commands,

00:09:47.938 --> 00:09:50.594
like how to stand at attention,
how to properly salute,

00:09:50.618 --> 00:09:51.779
and all the basics.

00:09:51.803 --> 00:09:54.134
I had to ask again if I could join.

00:09:54.158 --> 00:09:55.494
Finally, I got the go-ahead.

00:09:55.518 --> 00:09:57.262
I went to get in formation.

00:09:57.286 --> 00:09:59.369
I figured I better stand
in the second line,

00:09:59.393 --> 00:10:02.672
so I could watch what the cadets
were doing in the row ahead of me.

00:10:02.696 --> 00:10:06.526
But the officer who opened the door
for me to join the ROTC program

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:10.921
spotted me in the back and said,
“Hey! Uh-uh. I want you in the front.

00:10:10.945 --> 00:10:12.172
You want to be a soldier?

00:10:12.196 --> 00:10:15.092
You've got to learn the commands
just like the rest of them.

00:10:15.116 --> 00:10:17.965
You’re not going to follow other people.
Learn it yourself!”

00:10:17.989 --> 00:10:19.148
I thought, "Wow.

00:10:19.172 --> 00:10:22.083
He’s viewing me like any person,
giving dignity to who I am."

00:10:22.107 --> 00:10:23.804
I was impressed by that.

00:10:23.828 --> 00:10:26.964
So as the weeks went by,
I still didn’t have a uniform.

00:10:26.988 --> 00:10:30.468
I asked if it would be possible
to get one, but I was told it wasn't.

00:10:30.492 --> 00:10:32.048
So I continued on that way,

00:10:32.072 --> 00:10:36.303
until one day, I was informed
that I’d be getting a uniform.

00:10:36.835 --> 00:10:39.910
"Please!" I said, “Really?
Why? What changed?”

00:10:39.934 --> 00:10:43.916
I was told, “We see your motivation,
you show up every morning, dedicated,

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.920
and always gave a 110% effort.”

00:10:45.944 --> 00:10:47.650
They wanted to give me the uniform.

00:10:47.674 --> 00:10:48.932
It was remarkable.

00:10:49.329 --> 00:10:51.373
We went to the warehouse
to get my uniform.

00:10:51.397 --> 00:10:54.576
I assumed I’d just get a uniform
and a pair of boots, nothing more.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:57.787
But they filled two duffel bags
chock-full of gear:

00:10:57.811 --> 00:11:01.002
helmet, ammo vest, shovel,
sleeping bag -- the whole nine yards.

00:11:01.026 --> 00:11:02.375
I was astonished.

00:11:03.842 --> 00:11:05.208
And I have to tell you,

00:11:06.415 --> 00:11:09.633
each morning that I get up
and put on my uniform,

00:11:09.657 --> 00:11:11.229
I feel privileged.

00:11:12.236 --> 00:11:14.656
It’s truly an honor to wear the uniform.

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:18.266
So, moving along,

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.589
when it came time to train
at the garrison base,

00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:22.537
at first, I was told I couldn’t go.

00:11:22.561 --> 00:11:24.680
There was concern on the ROTC's part

00:11:24.704 --> 00:11:27.750
that if the interpreter
were to get injured during the training,

00:11:27.774 --> 00:11:29.205
it would be a liability issue.

00:11:29.229 --> 00:11:31.834
So we had to figure out
all those issues and confusion,

00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:34.346
but we worked it out,
and in the end, they let me go.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.748
That's how events were unfolding;
I was permitted to do more and more.

00:11:37.772 --> 00:11:41.311
Once, at the garrison base,
during one of the training days,

00:11:41.335 --> 00:11:45.894
a huge Chinook helicopter with its
tandem rotors landed right down to us,

00:11:45.918 --> 00:11:48.087
forcefully spinning
exhilaration in the air.

00:11:48.456 --> 00:11:51.013
All of us cadets were supposed
to be getting on board.

00:11:51.037 --> 00:11:53.107
Everyone was geared up and ready.

00:11:53.131 --> 00:11:54.871
However, the cadre had decided

00:11:54.895 --> 00:11:57.558
I wasn’t going to be able
to ride the Chinook.

00:11:57.582 --> 00:11:59.964
They were afraid
if the pilot shouted out orders,

00:11:59.988 --> 00:12:02.220
how would I be able
to follow the instructions?

00:12:02.244 --> 00:12:04.143
I’d potentially cause a disruption.

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:06.161
So I had to stand aside,

00:12:06.185 --> 00:12:09.195
while the others were filing
toward the helicopter.

00:12:09.219 --> 00:12:12.174
I could see the cadre huddled up,
discussing, mulling it over.

00:12:12.198 --> 00:12:15.615
At the last minute, one of them said,
“Come on! Get on the helicopter!”

00:12:15.639 --> 00:12:18.082
I rushed over and got in.
It was such a thrill.

00:12:19.609 --> 00:12:23.063
And that was the spirit of learning about
and supporting one another

00:12:23.087 --> 00:12:24.238
that carried over.

00:12:24.262 --> 00:12:27.021
And since then, I’ve been involved
in everything they do,

00:12:27.045 --> 00:12:28.268
without any separation.

00:12:28.792 --> 00:12:30.960
This is where my passion lies.

00:12:30.984 --> 00:12:33.774
I love them. I’ll show you
some pictures here.

00:12:35.019 --> 00:12:38.739
Bruin Battalion, Bravo Company --
that’s the name of the group I belong to.

00:12:38.763 --> 00:12:43.229
The cadre are the officers and sergeants
who oversee the ROTC program.

00:12:43.727 --> 00:12:46.852
In the beginning, you can see,
it was a bit of an awkward phase.

00:12:46.876 --> 00:12:50.021
But once they learned more about me
and what I’m capable of doing,

00:12:50.045 --> 00:12:52.067
there's been tremendous support and unity.

00:12:52.091 --> 00:12:55.462
The cadets, my fellow peers --
well, when you train and sweat together,

00:12:55.486 --> 00:12:57.661
you feel the bond
of camaraderie right away.

00:12:57.685 --> 00:13:00.570
A brother- or sisterly cohesiveness
makes them like family.

00:13:01.035 --> 00:13:04.772
In training and military science classes,
we learn theories of warfare,

00:13:04.796 --> 00:13:07.921
how to lead soldiers,
how to do reconnaissance,

00:13:07.945 --> 00:13:10.015
strategies, how to knock out a bunker

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:14.075
and land navigation, where you’re finding
your way out in the mountains.

00:13:15.916 --> 00:13:19.795
As far as accommodations,
I’ve been provided with interpreters

00:13:19.819 --> 00:13:23.768
through the National Center on Deafness,
NCOD, here at CSUN.

00:13:23.792 --> 00:13:25.340
And I really have to thank them,

00:13:25.364 --> 00:13:27.277
because it's hard to find interpreters

00:13:27.301 --> 00:13:29.685
who are willing to wake up
at 4:30 in the morning,

00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:31.594
or sometimes even 3:30 in the morning.

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.074
That's the officer who emailed me back,

00:13:34.098 --> 00:13:36.611
saying I think you can have
a few classes with us.

00:13:36.635 --> 00:13:38.394
That's Lieutenant Mendoza.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.650
That’s my interpreter there,
before class starts.

00:13:41.974 --> 00:13:45.528
This is a picture from last fall,
when we were new to training.

00:13:46.435 --> 00:13:48.753
This is Lieutenant Colonel Phelps,

00:13:49.274 --> 00:13:51.036
this being his name sign.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.274
He's the commanding officer
of the entire Bruin Battalion.

00:13:55.067 --> 00:13:58.896
Every time I see him walk by,
it’s rather inspiring.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:04.424
I mean, the way he presents himself,
you can see he’s the epitome of a soldier.

00:14:04.849 --> 00:14:07.019
Plus, he doesn't view me as a deaf person.

00:14:07.043 --> 00:14:09.692
He looks at my skills
and capabilities instead.

00:14:09.716 --> 00:14:12.902
He’s really pushed for me,
and I respect him for all that.

00:14:12.926 --> 00:14:14.782
That’s me during one of the exercises.

00:14:14.806 --> 00:14:17.581
This is that Chinook helicopter
I almost didn’t get on.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.119
Every cadet has a mentor.

00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:23.318
My mentor is Cinatl.

00:14:23.809 --> 00:14:25.675
He’s a really sharp soldier.

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:29.399
He teaches me all the finer points
and how to execute them ideally.

00:14:30.224 --> 00:14:33.879
This top picture is when
a group of us went to Las Vegas

00:14:33.903 --> 00:14:35.228
to compete in a test,

00:14:35.252 --> 00:14:39.151
to see if we could match the German
troops' physical training standards.

00:14:39.175 --> 00:14:43.150
It involved swimming, timed sprints,
marksmanship and numerous fitness events.

00:14:43.174 --> 00:14:45.310
I passed them
and satisfied the requirements

00:14:45.334 --> 00:14:49.550
to be awarded the gold German Armed Forces
Proficiency Badge right here.

00:14:51.087 --> 00:14:53.894
This is one of the sergeants,
Sergeant Richardson.

00:14:53.918 --> 00:14:57.606
I love this guy. He doesn't take baloney
from any of us cadets.

00:14:59.955 --> 00:15:01.572
Here I am one morning,

00:15:01.596 --> 00:15:04.914
when we trekked seven and a half miles
with a 40-pound rucksack

00:15:04.938 --> 00:15:06.477
in less than two hours.

00:15:07.061 --> 00:15:09.233
Here are a few of my fellow cadets.

00:15:10.471 --> 00:15:15.126
I've been with them long enough
that I’ve developed name signs for them.

00:15:15.696 --> 00:15:17.748
On the right, here, is Trinidad.

00:15:17.772 --> 00:15:21.210
I gave him this name sign
because he's always very sarcastic.

00:15:21.234 --> 00:15:24.549
He's a veteran, having served
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:15:24.573 --> 00:15:27.641
The female is Frigo,
whose nickname is "Refrigerator,"

00:15:27.665 --> 00:15:28.886
hence her name sign.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:31.337
We’re always competing
intellectually in class.

00:15:31.361 --> 00:15:35.481
The cadet on the end is Jarvy.
He's a top athlete.

00:15:35.505 --> 00:15:38.515
I've given him this sign
because of the scar he has here.

00:15:39.038 --> 00:15:40.467
Do you know who this is?

00:15:40.491 --> 00:15:43.885
This is the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:46.105
He is the highest-ranking military officer

00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:49.064
and principal military advisor
to President Obama

00:15:49.088 --> 00:15:50.987
and Secretary of Defense Gates.

00:15:51.418 --> 00:15:54.022
He gave a talk at UCLA to a full house.

00:15:54.046 --> 00:15:56.048
Afterwards, I lined up to shake his hand.

00:15:56.072 --> 00:15:59.259
Having done so, I greeted him,
“It’s a great pleasure to meet you.”

00:15:59.283 --> 00:16:01.329
I signed and my interpreter voiced for me.

00:16:01.353 --> 00:16:04.906
Admiral Mullen turned to the interpreter
and said, “It’s nice to meet you,”

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.528
addressing the interpreter,
who refrained to clarify.

00:16:07.552 --> 00:16:10.047
He seemed a little confused
and just quickly moved on

00:16:10.071 --> 00:16:12.181
to shake hands
with the rest of the soldiers.

00:16:12.205 --> 00:16:15.076
So I’m not sure whether he really knew
that I'm deaf or not.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.191
So everything’s been moving along,
gung-ho, full speed ahead,

00:16:19.215 --> 00:16:22.820
until two weeks ago,

00:16:23.266 --> 00:16:24.701
when something occurred.

00:16:25.599 --> 00:16:28.418
Well, the ROTC has four levels.

00:16:28.442 --> 00:16:32.926
I’m currently doing the first two levels,
which finishes up this May.

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.851
The third level will begin in the fall.

00:16:34.875 --> 00:16:37.940
But in order to move up,
you need to pass a medical exam.

00:16:38.589 --> 00:16:43.079
Obviously, I’m deaf,
so I’d fail a hearing test.

00:16:44.921 --> 00:16:46.960
So we sat down,

00:16:46.984 --> 00:16:51.097
and I was told that if I wanted
to continue to the third level,

00:16:51.121 --> 00:16:54.883
I couldn’t do any
of the PT workouts in the morning,

00:16:54.907 --> 00:16:59.921
nor the Friday lab field trainings,
nor the army base trainings.

00:16:59.945 --> 00:17:02.337
My uniform, I would have to
give back as well.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.997
I could take the classes,
audit them, and that’s all.

00:17:07.418 --> 00:17:10.322
It really hit me. It was a huge blow.

00:17:13.487 --> 00:17:16.663
Many of the officers
and cadets have empathized

00:17:16.687 --> 00:17:19.016
with this sudden shock of disappointment,

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.553
and are wondering
why this has to be the case.

00:17:22.037 --> 00:17:25.029
Colonel Phelps has tried
to speak with the higher-ups

00:17:25.053 --> 00:17:26.378
in the chain of command

00:17:26.402 --> 00:17:28.994
and explain to them
that I’m one of the top cadets,

00:17:29.018 --> 00:17:32.378
having passed all the events
and receiving high marks on my exams.

00:17:32.402 --> 00:17:34.037
But their response is unwavering:

00:17:34.061 --> 00:17:37.027
policy is policy, and if you’re deaf,
you’re disqualified.

00:17:38.167 --> 00:17:42.387
I know that the cadre has tried
to find various ways.

00:17:42.411 --> 00:17:46.010
They found out that
there's a deaf cadet at The Citadel,

00:17:47.005 --> 00:17:49.235
a military college in South Carolina.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.446
That particular cadet will be completing
his fourth year there

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:54.637
and graduating this May.

00:17:54.661 --> 00:17:56.931
Yet, he's in the same
predicament that I'm in --

00:17:56.955 --> 00:17:59.168
unable to join the army because he’s deaf.

00:18:00.955 --> 00:18:03.708
Yet, all of my fellow cadets
and the officers have told me

00:18:03.732 --> 00:18:05.872
not to give up; the policy must change.

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:08.540
I was advised to talk with my congressman.

00:18:08.564 --> 00:18:11.797
And I've brought this issue
to Henry Waxman,

00:18:11.821 --> 00:18:13.872
the district congressman here in LA,

00:18:13.896 --> 00:18:16.540
to get the ball rolling
with his advocacy for my cause.

00:18:16.564 --> 00:18:18.944
However, I need your help
and support to lobby.

00:18:18.968 --> 00:18:20.181
All of us, you know?

00:18:20.752 --> 00:18:23.899
If you remember back in US history,
African-Americans were told

00:18:23.923 --> 00:18:25.467
they couldn’t join the military,

00:18:25.491 --> 00:18:26.642
and now they serve.

00:18:26.666 --> 00:18:29.289
Women as well were banned,
but now they've been allowed.

00:18:29.313 --> 00:18:30.954
The military has and is changing.

00:18:30.978 --> 00:18:33.353
