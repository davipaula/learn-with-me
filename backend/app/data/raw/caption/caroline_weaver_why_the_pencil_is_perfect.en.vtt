00:00:12.198 --> 00:00:15.563
The sound is a really big part, I think,
of the experience of using a pencil,

00:00:15.588 --> 00:00:19.064
and it has this really
audible scratchiness.

00:00:19.088 --> 00:00:21.290
(Scratching)

00:00:22.286 --> 00:00:24.806
[Small thing. Big idea.]

00:00:25.985 --> 00:00:28.313
[Caroline Weaver on
the Pencil]

00:00:28.556 --> 00:00:30.926
The pencil is a very simple object.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.435
It's made of wood
with some layers of paint

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:34.975
an eraser and a core,

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:37.395
which is made out of graphite,
clay and water.

00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:39.951
Yeah, it took hundreds
of people over centuries

00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:41.651
to come to this design.

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:44.956
And it's that long history
of collaboration

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.638
that, to me, makes it
a very perfect object.

00:00:48.075 --> 00:00:50.349
The story of the pencil
starts with graphite.

00:00:50.373 --> 00:00:53.290
People started finding
really useful applications

00:00:53.314 --> 00:00:54.925
for this new substance.

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.107
They cut it into small sticks

00:00:57.131 --> 00:00:59.599
and wrapped it in string
or sheepskin or paper

00:00:59.623 --> 00:01:01.617
and sold it on the streets of London

00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:03.797
to be used for writing or for drawing

00:01:03.821 --> 00:01:06.313
or, a lot of times,
by farmers and shepherds,

00:01:06.337 --> 00:01:07.996
who used it to mark their animals.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.263
Over in France,

00:01:09.287 --> 00:01:13.441
Nicolas-Jacques Conté figured out a method
of grinding the graphite,

00:01:13.465 --> 00:01:16.584
mixing it with powdered clay
and water to make a paste.

00:01:16.608 --> 00:01:19.777
From there, this paste was filled
into a mold and fired in a kiln,

00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:22.751
and the result was
a really strong graphite core

00:01:22.775 --> 00:01:25.894
that wasn't breakable,
that was smooth, usable --

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:29.014
it was so much better than anything else
that existed at the time,

00:01:29.038 --> 00:01:32.848
and to this day, that's the method
that's still used in making pencils.

00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:36.588
Meanwhile, over in America,
in Concord, Massachusetts,

00:01:36.612 --> 00:01:39.660
it was Henry David Thoreau
who came up with the grading scale

00:01:39.684 --> 00:01:41.770
for different hardnesses of pencil.

00:01:41.794 --> 00:01:43.717
It was graded one through four,

00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:47.392
number two being the ideal
hardness for general use.

00:01:47.416 --> 00:01:49.966
The softer the pencil,
the more graphite it had in it,

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.355
and the darker and smoother
the line will be.

00:01:53.495 --> 00:01:55.782
The firmer the pencil,
the more clay it had in it

00:01:55.806 --> 00:01:57.816
and the lighter and finer it will be.

00:01:58.607 --> 00:02:01.774
Originally, when pencils were handmade,
they were made round.

00:02:01.798 --> 00:02:03.472
There was no easy way to make them,

00:02:03.496 --> 00:02:06.758
and it was the Americans
who really mechanized the craft.

00:02:06.782 --> 00:02:08.728
A lot of people credit Joseph Dixon

00:02:08.752 --> 00:02:12.440
for being one of the first people
to start developing actual machines

00:02:12.464 --> 00:02:16.371
to do things like cut wood slats,
cut grooves into the wood,

00:02:16.395 --> 00:02:17.604
apply glue to them ...

00:02:17.628 --> 00:02:20.439
And they figured out
it was easier and less wasteful

00:02:20.463 --> 00:02:22.091
to do a hexagonal pencil,

00:02:22.115 --> 00:02:23.973
and so that became the standard.

00:02:24.558 --> 00:02:26.121
Since the early days of pencils,

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:28.210
people have loved that they can be erased.

00:02:29.942 --> 00:02:31.510
Originally, it was bread crumbs

00:02:31.534 --> 00:02:33.617
that were used
to scratch away pencil marks

00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:35.210
and later, rubber and pumice.

00:02:35.675 --> 00:02:38.967
The attached eraser happened in 1858,

00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:42.948
when American stationer
Hymen Lipman patented the first pencil

00:02:42.972 --> 00:02:44.354
with an attached eraser,

00:02:44.378 --> 00:02:46.250
which really changed the pencil game.

00:02:46.965 --> 00:02:50.359
The world's first yellow pencil
was the KOH-I-NOOR 1500.

00:02:50.383 --> 00:02:51.888
KOH-I-NOOR did this crazy thing

00:02:51.912 --> 00:02:54.825
where they painted this pencil
with 14 coats of yellow paint

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.782
and dipped the end in 14-carat gold.

00:02:57.442 --> 00:02:59.016
There is a pencil for everyone,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.447
and every pencil has a story.

00:03:02.046 --> 00:03:06.425
The Blackwing 602 is famous
for being used by a lot of writers,

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:09.409
especially John Steinbeck
and Vladimir Nabokov.

00:03:09.433 --> 00:03:12.037
And then, you have
the Dixon pencil company.

00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:14.998
They're responsible
for the Dixon Ticonderoga.

00:03:15.022 --> 00:03:16.173
It's an icon,

00:03:16.197 --> 00:03:18.724
it's what people think of
when they think of a pencil

00:03:18.748 --> 00:03:21.171
and what they think of
when they think of school.

00:03:21.195 --> 00:03:23.409
And the pencil's really
a thing that, I think,

00:03:23.433 --> 00:03:25.910
the average user
has never thought twice about,

00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:28.079
how it's made or why it's made
the way it is,

00:03:28.103 --> 00:03:30.047
because it's just always been that way.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.284
In my opinion, there's nothing
that can be done

00:03:33.308 --> 00:03:35.172
to make the pencil better than it is.

00:03:36.267 --> 00:03:37.417
It's perfect.
