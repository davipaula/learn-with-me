00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.496
How can we get people to do more good,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.856
to go to the polls,
give to charity, conserve resources,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.216
or even to do something as simple
as washing their mugs at work

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.621
so that the sink isn't
always full of dirty dishes?

00:00:26.645 --> 00:00:28.656
(Laughter)

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.016
(Applause)

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.176
When I first started
working on this problem,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.096
I collaborated with a power company

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.656
to recruit customers for a program
that prevents blackouts

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.680
by reducing energy demand during peaks.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.216
The program is based
on a tried-and-true technology.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.616
It's one the Obama
administration even called

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.760
"the cornerstone to modernizing
America's electrical grid."

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.376
But, like so many
great technological solutions,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.840
it has a key weakness:

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.960
people.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.960
People need to sign up.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.536
To try to get people to sign up,
the power company sent them a nice letter,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.576
told them about
all the program's benefits,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.656
and it asked them to call
into a hotline if they were interested.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.376
Those letters went out,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.160
but the phones, they were silent.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.840
So when we got involved,
we suggested one small change.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.256
Instead of that hotline,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.896
we suggested that they use sign-up sheets
that they'd post near the mailboxes

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.160
in people's buildings.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.880
This tripled participation.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.360
Why?

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.896
Well, we all know people care deeply
about what others think of them,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.576
that we try to be seen
as generous and kind,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.320
and we try to avoid
being seen as selfish or a mooch.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.536
Whether we are aware of it or not,
this is a big part of why people do good,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.776
and so small changes that give people
more credit for doing good,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.136
those changes can make
a really big difference.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.056
Small changes like
switching from a hotline,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.096
where nobody will ever find out
about your good deed,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.856
to a sign-up sheet

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.000
where anyone who walks by
can see your name.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.696
In our collaborations with governments,
nonprofits, companies,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.536
when we're trying to get people
to do more good,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.960
we harness the power of reputations.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.376
And we have a simple checklist for this.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.640
And in fact, you already know
the first item on that checklist.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.256
It's to increase observability,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.000
to make sure people find out
about good deeds.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.336
Now, wait a minute, I know
some of you are probably thinking,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.056
there's no way people here thought,

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.736
"Oh, well, now that
I'm getting credit for my good deed,

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.096
now it's totally worth it."

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.576
And you're right.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.840
Usually, people don't.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.816
Rather, when they're making
decisions in private,

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.576
they worry about their own problems,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.736
about what to put on the table for dinner
or how to pay their bills on time.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.856
But, when we make
their decision more observable,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.960
they start to attend more
to the opportunity to do good.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.576
In other words, what's
so powerful about our approach

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.456
is that it could turn on
people's existing desire to do good,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.560
in this case, to help
to prevent a blackout.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.816
Back to observability.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.696
I want to give you another example.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.456
This one is from a collaboration

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.856
with a nonprofit that gets out the vote,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.456
and it does this by sending hundreds
of thousands of letters every election

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.800
in order to remind people and try
to motivate them to go to the polls.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.920
We suggested adding
the following sentence:

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.840
"Someone may call you to find out
about your experience at the polls."

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.920
This sentence makes it feel
more observable when you go to the polls,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.080
and it increased the effect
of the letter by 50 percent.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.416
Making the letter more effective reduced
the cost of getting an additional vote

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.400
from 70 dollars down to about 40 dollars.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.136
Observability has been used to do things

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.816
like get people
to donate blood more frequently

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.816
by listing the names of donors
on local newsletters,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.480
or to pay their taxes on time

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.256
by listing the names of delinquents
on a public website.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.120
(Laughter)

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.400
What about this example?

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.616
Toyota got hundreds of thousands of people
to buy a more fuel-efficient car

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.256
by making the Prius so unique ...

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.880
(Laughter)

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.480
that their good deed
was observable from a mile away.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.856
(Laughter)

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.255
Alright, so observability is great,

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:36.816
but we all know, we've all seen

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.000
people walk by an opportunity to do good.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.376
They'll see somebody
asking for money on the sidewalk

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.016
and they'll pull out their phones
and look really busy,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.600
or they'll go to the museum and they'll
waltz right on by the donation box.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.416
Imagine it's the holiday season

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.136
and you're going to the supermarket,
and there's a Salvation Army volunteer,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.416
and he's ringing his bell.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.416
A few years ago, researchers in San Diego

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.896
teamed up with a local chapter
from the Salvation Army

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.120
to try to find ways to increase donations.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.860
What they found was kind of funny.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.080
When the volunteer
stood in front of just one door,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.600
people would avoid giving
by going out the other door.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.080
Why?

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.776
Well, because they can always claim,
"Oh, I didn't see the volunteer,"

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.056
or, "I wanted to get
something from over there,"

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.480
or, "That's where my car is."

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.480
In other words, there's lots of excuses.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.616
And that brings us
to the second item on our checklist:

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.360
to eliminate excuses.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.456
In the case of the Salvation Army,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.736
eliminating excuses just means
standing in front of both doors,

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.816
and sure enough, when they did this,

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.040
donations rose.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.456
But that's when things got kind of funny,

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.680
even funnier.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.496
The researchers
were out in the parking lot,

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.696
and they were counting people
as they came in and out of the store,

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.536
and they noticed that when the volunteers
stood in front of both doors,

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.736
people stopped coming
out of the store at all.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.816
(Laughter)

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.976
Obviously, they were surprised by this,
so they decided to look into it further,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.096
and that's when they found that there
was actually a third, smaller utility door

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.096
usually used to take out the recycling --

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.656
(Laughter)

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.176
and now people were going out that door
in order to avoid the volunteers.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.560
(Laughter)

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.640
This teaches us
an important lesson though.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.016
When we're trying to eliminate excuses,
we need to be very thorough,

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.416
because people are
really creative in making them.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.640
(Laughter)

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.616
Alright, I want to switch to a setting

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.840
where excuses can have
deadly consequences.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.880
What if I told you that the world's
deadliest infectious disease has a cure,

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.896
in fact, that it's had one for 70 years,

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.120
a good one, one that works
almost every time?

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.480
It's incredible, but it's true.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.376
The disease is tuberculosis.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.696
It infects some 10 million people a year,

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.840
and it kills almost two million of them.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.736
Like the blackout prevention program,
we've got the solution.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.000
The problem is people.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.736
People need to take their medication

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.656
so that they're cured,

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.840
and so that they don't
get other people sick.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.656
For a few years now,
we've been collaborating

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.976
with a mobile health startup
called Keheala

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.680
to support TB patients
as they undergo treatment.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.376
Now, you have to understand,
TB treatment, it's really tough.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.976
We're talking about taking
a really strong antibiotic

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.336
every single day for six months or more.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.256
That antibiotic is so strong
that it will make you feel sick.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.256
It will make you feel nauseous and dizzy.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.200
It will make your pee turn funny colors.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.616
It's also a problem because
you have to go back to the clinic

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.056
about every week
in order to get more pills,

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.536
and in sub-Saharan Africa
or other places where TB is common,

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.016
now you're talking
about going someplace pretty far,

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:01.056
taking tough and slow public transport,

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.136
maybe the clinic is inefficient.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.376
So now you're talking about taking
a half day off of work every week

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.280
from a job you desperately
can't afford to lose.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:13.416
It's even worse when you consider the fact
that there's a terrible stigma,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.856
and you desperately don't want people
to find that you have the disease.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.736
Some of the toughest stories we hear
are actually from women

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.296
who, in these places where
domestic violence can be kind of common,

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.056
they tell us that they have to
hide it from their husbands

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.720
that they're coming to the clinic.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.600
So it's no surprise
that people don't complete treatment.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.976
Can our approach really help them?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.880
Can we really get them to stick it out?

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.240
Yeah.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.176
Every day, we text patients
to remind them to take their medication,

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.736
but if we stopped there,

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.816
there'd be lots of excuses.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.296
"Well, I didn't see the text."

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.015
Or, "You know, I saw the text,
but then I totally forgot,

00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:56.256
put the phone down
and I just forgot about it."

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.080
Or, "I lent the phone out to my mom."

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.616
We have to eliminate these excuses

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.656
and we do that by asking patients

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.640
to log in and verify
that they've taken their medication.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.936
If they don't log in, we text them again.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.056
If they don't log in,
we text them yet again.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.096
If, after three times,
they still haven't verified,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.936
we notify a team of supporters

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.216
and that team will call and text them

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.040
to try to get them back on the wagon.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.160
No excuses.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.296
Our approach, which, admittedly,
uses all sorts of behavioral techniques,

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.536
including, as you've
probably noticed, observability,

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.800
it was very effective.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.976
Patients without access to our platform

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.160
were three times more likely
not to complete treatment.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.896
Alright,

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.456
you've increased observability,

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.696
you've eliminated excuses,

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.360
but there's still a third thing
you need to be aware of.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.056
If you've been to Washington, DC
or Japan or London,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.776
you know that metro riders there

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.256
will be very careful to stand
on the right-hand side of the escalator

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.200
so that people can go by on the left.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.536
But unfortunately,
not everywhere is that the norm,

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.736
and there's plenty of places
where you can just stand on both sides

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.016
and block the escalator.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.656
Obviously, it's better for others

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.976
when we stand on the right
and let them go by,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.720
but we're only expected
to do that some places.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.136
This is a general phenomenon.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.216
Sometimes we're expected to do good

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.056
and sometimes not,

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.456
and it means that people
are really sensitive to cues

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.440
that they're expected to do good
in a particular situation,

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.296
which brings us to the third
and final item on our checklist:

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.096
to communicate expectations,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.536
to tell people,

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.640
"Do the good deed right now."

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.936
Here's a simple way
to communicate expectations;

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.136
simply tell them, "Hey, everybody else
is doing the good deed."

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.336
The company Opower
sends people in their electricity bill

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.136
a small insert that compares
their energy consumption

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.400
with that of people
with similarly sized homes.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.456
And when people find out that their
neighbors are using less electricity,

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.376
they start to consume less.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.056
That same approach, it's been used
to get people to vote or give to charity

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.200
or even reuse their towels in hotels.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.440
What about this one?

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.736
Here's another way
to communicate expectations;

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.840
simply do it by saying, "Do the good deed"
just at the right time.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.040
What about this one?

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.936
This ticker reframes

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.776
the kind of mundane task
of turning off the lights

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.640
and turns it instead
into an environmental contribution.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.136
The bottom line is,
lots of different ways to do this,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.216
lots of ways to communicate expectations.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.526
Just don't forget to do it.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:44.616
And that's it.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.840
That's our checklist.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.776
Many of you are working on problems
with important social consequences,

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.200
and sometimes you might need
to motivate people to do more good.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.536
The tools you learned today
can help you with this.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.736
And these tools, they don't require
that you raise additional funds

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.656
or that you develop
any more fancy technologies.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.456
They just require harnessing reputations

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.896
by increasing observability,
eliminating excuses

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.520
and communicating expectations.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.336
Thank you.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.800
(Applause)
