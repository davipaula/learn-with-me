00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:14.375
My name is Jon Gray.

00:00:14.417 --> 00:00:16.125
They call me "The Dishwasher."

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:20.101
I cofounded Ghetto Gastro,

00:00:20.125 --> 00:00:22.268
a Bronx-based collective

00:00:22.292 --> 00:00:26.708
that works at the intersection
of food, design and art.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.393
We create experiences that challenge
people's perceptions of the Bronx,

00:00:33.417 --> 00:00:35.125
the place that I call home.

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:39.601
It's a funny thing.

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:43.601
I just touched down in Vancouver
from Paris a few days ago.

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:48.018
We took over the Place Vendôme
with the Bronx Brasserie.

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:50.226
Oui oui, chérie.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.934
(Laughter)

00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:56.809
It's wild, because in Paris,
they have this saying,

00:00:56.833 --> 00:00:58.309
"le Bronx,"

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:03.518
which means something
is in disarray or a problem.

00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:05.101
That's the Place Vendôme.

00:01:05.125 --> 00:01:06.559
We shut it down one time.

00:01:06.583 --> 00:01:08.643
(Laughter)

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:12.559
This lingo came into play
when the Bronx was burning,

00:01:12.583 --> 00:01:16.018
and movies like "The Warriors"
and "Fort Apache"

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:17.583
still make an impression.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.351
Some may disagree,

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:22.583
but I believe the Bronx
was designed to fail.

00:01:24.458 --> 00:01:27.167
The power broker was a joker.

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:31.893
Robert Moses, instead of
parting the Red Sea,

00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:34.518
he parted the Bronx
with a six-lane highway

00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:36.083
and redlined my community.

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:39.958
My great-grandparents
had a home on Featherbed Lane,

00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:42.893
and contrary to the name,

00:01:42.917 --> 00:01:44.976
they couldn't get a good night's rest

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.851
due to the constant blasting
and drilling that was necessary

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:51.351
to build the cross-Bronx expressway

00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:53.101
a block away.

00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:56.309
I consider these policy decisions

00:01:56.333 --> 00:01:58.268
design crimes.

00:01:58.292 --> 00:02:02.042
(Applause)

00:02:02.542 --> 00:02:05.643
Being the resilient people
that we are uptown,

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:08.559
out of the systematic oppression

00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:14.518
hip-hop culture rose from the rubble
and the ashes like a phoenix.

00:02:14.542 --> 00:02:17.143
Hip-hop is now a trillion-dollar industry,

00:02:17.167 --> 00:02:20.518
but this economic activity
doesn't make it back to the Bronx

00:02:20.542 --> 00:02:22.042
or communities like it.

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:26.476
Let's take it back to 1986.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.393
I was born in the heart
of the AIDS crisis,

00:02:29.417 --> 00:02:31.184
the crack epidemic

00:02:31.208 --> 00:02:32.833
and the War on Drugs.

00:02:33.833 --> 00:02:38.601
The only thing that trickled down
from Reaganomics was ghettonomics:

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:43.083
pain, prison and poverty.

00:02:44.292 --> 00:02:50.684
I was raised by brilliant, beautiful
and accomplished black women.

00:02:50.708 --> 00:02:54.101
Even so, my pops wasn't in the picture,

00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:57.601
and I couldn't resist
the allure of the streets.

00:02:57.625 --> 00:02:59.059
Like Biggie said,

00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:02.708
you're either slinging crack rock
or you got a wicked jump shot.

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:06.000
Don't get it twisted, my jumper was wet.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.559
(Laughter)

00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:09.851
My shit was wet.

00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:13.809
(Applause)

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:16.768
But when I turned 15,
I started selling weed,

00:03:16.792 --> 00:03:18.559
I didn't finish high school,

00:03:18.583 --> 00:03:21.768
the New York Board of Education
banned me from all of those,

00:03:21.792 --> 00:03:25.268
but I did graduate
to selling cocaine when I turned 18.

00:03:25.292 --> 00:03:26.934
I did well.

00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:31.893
That was until I got jammed up,
caught a case, when I was 20.

00:03:31.917 --> 00:03:33.458
I was facing 10 years.

00:03:34.417 --> 00:03:38.518
I posted bail, signed up
at the Fashion Institute,

00:03:38.542 --> 00:03:40.934
I applied the skills
that I learned in the streets

00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:42.809
to start my own fashion brand.

00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:45.476
My lawyer peeked my ambition,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.500
so he suggested that the judge
grant me a suspended sentence.

00:03:49.292 --> 00:03:51.809
For once in my life,
a suspension was a good thing.

00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:54.000
(Laughter)

00:03:55.292 --> 00:03:58.833
Over the course of two years
and many court dates,

00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:01.458
my case got dismissed.

00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:05.726
Both of my brothers have done jail time,

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.809
so escaping the clutches
of the prison industrial system

00:04:08.833 --> 00:04:10.851
didn't seem realistic to me.

00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:13.458
Right now, one of my brothers
is facing 20 years.

00:04:15.042 --> 00:04:18.684
My mother put in great effort
in taking me out to eat,

00:04:18.708 --> 00:04:20.726
making sure we visited museums

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.684
and traveled abroad,

00:04:22.708 --> 00:04:25.667
basically exposing me
to as much culture as she could.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.726
I remembered how as a kid,

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.976
I used to take over the dinner table
and order food for everybody.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.059
Breaking bread has always
allowed me to break the mold

00:04:37.083 --> 00:04:38.458
and connect with people.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.601
Me and my homie Les,

00:04:40.625 --> 00:04:42.684
we grew up on the same block in the Bronx,

00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:44.018
two street dudes.

00:04:44.042 --> 00:04:45.351
He happened to be a chef.

00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:48.768
We always discussed the possibility
of doing something in the food game

00:04:48.792 --> 00:04:50.542
for the benefit of our neighborhood.

00:04:51.083 --> 00:04:53.792
Les had just won the food show "Chopped."

00:04:54.667 --> 00:04:58.809
Our homie Malcolm was gearing up
to run a pastry kitchen at Noma,

00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:01.792
yeah, world's best Noma in Copenhagen,
you know the vibes.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.143
My man P had just
finished training in I-I-Italy,

00:05:07.167 --> 00:05:08.833
Milano to be exact.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.101
We decided the world needed
some Bronx steasoning on it,

00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:16.250
so we mobbed up and formed Ghetto Gastro.

00:05:16.875 --> 00:05:20.125
(Applause)

00:05:26.167 --> 00:05:29.434
While I'm aware our name
makes a lot of people uncomfortable,

00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:30.875
for us "ghetto" means home.

00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:34.851
Similar to the way
someone in Mumbai or Nairobi

00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:37.143
might use the word "slum,"

00:05:37.167 --> 00:05:38.851
it's to locate our people

00:05:38.875 --> 00:05:42.417
and to indict the systems of neglect
that created these conditions.

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:47.833
(Applause)

00:05:48.583 --> 00:05:50.518
So what is Ghetto Gastro?

00:05:50.542 --> 00:05:54.309
Ultimately, it's a movement
and a philosophy.

00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:57.851
We view the work we do as gastrodiplomacy,

00:05:57.875 --> 00:06:00.268
using food and finesse

00:06:00.292 --> 00:06:03.167
to open borders and connect culture.

00:06:04.458 --> 00:06:06.559
Last year in Tokyo,

00:06:06.583 --> 00:06:09.809
we did a Caribbean patty,

00:06:09.833 --> 00:06:12.226
we do jerk wagyu beef,

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.684
shio kombu.

00:06:13.708 --> 00:06:17.667
We remixed the Bronx classic
with the Japanese elements.

00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:20.601
And for Kwanzaa,

00:06:20.625 --> 00:06:23.601
we had to pay homage to our Puerto Ricans,

00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:30.809
and we did a coconut charcoal
cognac coquito. Dímelo!

00:06:30.833 --> 00:06:33.601
(Laughter)

00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:36.893
This here is our Black Power waffle

00:06:36.917 --> 00:06:40.726
with some gold leaf syrup.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.601
Make sure you don't slip on the drip.

00:06:42.625 --> 00:06:44.518
(Laughter)

00:06:44.542 --> 00:06:48.583
Here we got the 36 Brix
plant-based velato.

00:06:49.292 --> 00:06:51.292
Strawberry fields, you know the deal.

00:06:53.292 --> 00:06:55.184
Compressed watermelon,

00:06:55.208 --> 00:06:56.684
basil seeds,

00:06:56.708 --> 00:06:59.184
a little bit of strawberries up there.

00:06:59.208 --> 00:07:01.976
Back to the Bronx Brasserie,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.601
you know we had to hit them in the head
with that caviar and cornbread.

00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:08.393
(Laughter)

00:07:08.417 --> 00:07:11.000
(Applause)

00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:16.809
We also practice du-rag diplomacy.

00:07:16.833 --> 00:07:18.393
(Laughter)

00:07:18.417 --> 00:07:22.518
Because, we don't edit who we are
when we do our thing.

00:07:22.542 --> 00:07:23.851
Due to our appearance,

00:07:23.875 --> 00:07:26.684
we often get mistaken
for rappers or athletes.

00:07:26.708 --> 00:07:28.976
It happened here last year at TED.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.643
This dude ran down on me

00:07:30.667 --> 00:07:32.667
and asked me when I was going to perform.

00:07:33.458 --> 00:07:34.893
How about now?

00:07:34.917 --> 00:07:39.583
(Applause)

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.434
So you see,

00:07:44.458 --> 00:07:46.809
we've been bringing the Bronx to the world

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:49.542
but now we focus on bringing
the world to the Bronx.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.643
We just opened our spot,

00:07:52.667 --> 00:07:54.476
an idea kitchen

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.500
where we make and design products,

00:07:57.958 --> 00:07:59.393
create content --

00:07:59.417 --> 00:08:05.750
(Music)

00:08:12.083 --> 00:08:14.518
and host community events.

00:08:14.542 --> 00:08:17.226
The intention is
to build financial capital

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.208
and creative capital in our hood.

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:23.601
We're also collaborating
with world-renowned chef

00:08:23.625 --> 00:08:26.226
Massimo Bottura

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.601
on a refettorio in the Bronx.

00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:33.434
A refettorio is a design-focused
soup kitchen and community center.

00:08:33.458 --> 00:08:34.726
You see the vibes.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.208
(Applause)

00:08:40.917 --> 00:08:44.143
The recent outpouring of grief
about the murder

00:08:44.167 --> 00:08:47.101
of rapper and entrepreneur Nipsey Hussle

00:08:47.125 --> 00:08:52.351
is largely due to the fact that he decided
to stay and evolve in place,

00:08:52.375 --> 00:08:54.518
rather than leave his hood.

00:08:54.542 --> 00:08:57.768
After his death, some may see
this decision as foolish,

00:08:57.792 --> 00:09:00.309
but I'm making that same
decision every day:

00:09:00.333 --> 00:09:01.726
to live in the Bronx,

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.309
to create in the Bronx,

00:09:03.333 --> 00:09:05.309
to invest in the Bronx.

00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:09.667
(Applause)

00:09:14.333 --> 00:09:17.184
At Ghetto Gastro, we don't run
from the word "ghetto,"

00:09:17.208 --> 00:09:19.559
and we don't run from the ghetto.

00:09:19.583 --> 00:09:21.393
Because at the end of the day,

00:09:21.417 --> 00:09:24.643
Ghetto Gastro is about showing you
what we already know:

00:09:24.667 --> 00:09:26.643
the hood

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:27.917
is good.

00:09:28.583 --> 00:09:33.018
(Applause)

00:09:33.042 --> 00:09:34.643
Thank you.

00:09:34.667 --> 00:09:37.101
(Applause)
