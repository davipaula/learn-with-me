00:00:12.126 --> 00:00:14.397
Chris Anderson: OK, Stewart,

00:00:14.421 --> 00:00:18.792
in the '60s, you -- I think it was '68 --
you founded this magazine.

00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:21.959
Stewart Brand: Bravo!
It's the original one.

00:00:21.983 --> 00:00:23.152
That's hard to find.

00:00:23.176 --> 00:00:24.540
CA: Right. Issue One, right?

00:00:24.564 --> 00:00:25.716
SB: Mm hmm.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.241
CA: Why did that make so much impact?

00:00:29.381 --> 00:00:32.750
SB: Counterculture was the main event
that I was part of at the time,

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:36.949
and it was made up
of hippies and New Left.

00:00:37.797 --> 00:00:39.701
That was sort of my contemporaries,

00:00:39.725 --> 00:00:41.977
the people I was just slightly older than.

00:00:42.381 --> 00:00:47.582
And my mode is to look
at where the interesting flow is

00:00:47.606 --> 00:00:49.571
and then look in the other direction.

00:00:49.595 --> 00:00:50.985
CA: (Laughs)

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.653
SB: Partly, I was trained to do that
as an army officer,

00:00:53.677 --> 00:00:56.710
but partly, it's just a cheap heuristic
to find originalities:

00:00:56.734 --> 00:00:59.203
don't look where everybody
else is looking,

00:00:59.227 --> 00:01:00.492
look the opposite way.

00:01:00.516 --> 00:01:04.357
So the deal with counterculture is,
the hippies were very romantic

00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:06.228
and kind of against technology,

00:01:06.252 --> 00:01:08.422
except very good LSD from Sandoz,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.942
and the New Left was against technology

00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.191
because they thought
it was a power device.

00:01:15.654 --> 00:01:18.992
Computers were: do not spindle,
fold, or mutilate.

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:20.248
Fight that.

00:01:20.684 --> 00:01:25.910
And so, the Whole Earth Catalog
was kind of a counter-counterculture thing

00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:29.092
in the sense that I bought
Buckminster Fuller's idea

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:32.462
that tools of are of the essence.

00:01:33.053 --> 00:01:38.326
Science and engineers basically
define the world in interesting ways.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.188
If all the politicians
disappeared one week,

00:01:41.212 --> 00:01:42.963
it would be ... a nuisance.

00:01:43.582 --> 00:01:46.876
But if all the scientists
and engineers disappeared one week,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.731
it would be way more than a nuisance.

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:51.033
CA: We still believe that, I think.

00:01:51.057 --> 00:01:53.354
SB: So focus on that.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.046
And then the New Left was talking
about power to the people.

00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:02.173
And people like Steve Jobs
and Steve Wozniak

00:02:02.847 --> 00:02:05.217
cut that and just said, power to people,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.916
tools that actually work.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.365
And so, where Fuller was saying
don't try to change human nature,

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:17.527
people have been trying for a long time
and it does not even bend,

00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:19.351
but you can change tools very easily.

00:02:19.375 --> 00:02:22.456
So the efficient thing to do
if you want to make the world better

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.942
is not try to make people behave
differently like the New Left was,

00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:28.900
but just give them tools
that go in the right direction.

00:02:28.924 --> 00:02:30.754
That was the Whole Earth Catalog.

00:02:30.778 --> 00:02:34.151
CA: And Stewart, the central image --
this is one of the first images,

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:36.781
the first time people had seen
Earth from outer space.

00:02:36.805 --> 00:02:38.094
That had an impact, too.

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:42.323
SB: It was kind of a chance
that in the spring of '66,

00:02:42.347 --> 00:02:45.244
thanks to an LSD experience
on a rooftop in San Francisco,

00:02:45.268 --> 00:02:48.346
I got thinking about, again,
something that Fuller talked about,

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.749
that a lot of people assume
that the Earth is flat

00:02:50.773 --> 00:02:53.012
and kind of infinite
in terms of its resources,

00:02:53.036 --> 00:02:55.276
but once you really grasp
that it's a sphere

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.536
and that there's only so much of it,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.003
then you start husbanding your resources

00:03:00.027 --> 00:03:02.017
and thinking about it as a finite system.

00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:04.211
"Spaceship Earth" was his metaphor.

00:03:04.235 --> 00:03:07.175
And I wanted that to be the case,

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:11.848
but on LSD I was getting higher and higher
on my hundred micrograms

00:03:11.872 --> 00:03:13.913
on the roof of San Francisco,

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:19.449
and noticed that the downtown buildings
which were right in front of me

00:03:19.473 --> 00:03:22.709
were not all parallel,
they were sort of fanned out like this.

00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:26.215
And that's because
they are on a curved surface.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.205
And if I were even higher,
I would see that even more clearly,

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:31.011
higher than that, more clearly still,

00:03:31.035 --> 00:03:32.685
higher enough, and it would close,

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.043
and you would get
the circle of Earth from space.

00:03:35.067 --> 00:03:37.984
And I thought, you know, we've been
in space for 10 years --

00:03:38.008 --> 00:03:40.022
at that time, this is '66 --

00:03:40.046 --> 00:03:41.986
and the cameras had never looked back.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.512
They'd always been looking out
or looking at just parts of the Earth.

00:03:45.536 --> 00:03:50.009
And so I said, why haven't we seen
a photograph of the whole Earth yet?

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:53.497
And it went around and NASA got it
and senators, secretaries got it,

00:03:53.521 --> 00:03:55.639
and various people
in the Politburo got it,

00:03:55.663 --> 00:03:57.152
and it went around and around.

00:03:57.176 --> 00:03:58.766
And within two and a half years,

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.067
about the time the Whole Earth
Catalog came out,

00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:02.648
these images started to appear,

00:04:02.672 --> 00:04:04.813
and indeed, they did transform everything.

00:04:04.837 --> 00:04:08.839
And my idea of hacking civilization

00:04:09.514 --> 00:04:13.718
is that you try to do something
lazy and ingenious

00:04:13.742 --> 00:04:16.444
and just sort of trick the situation.

00:04:16.468 --> 00:04:18.482
So all of these photographs
that you see --

00:04:18.506 --> 00:04:20.588
and then the march for science last week,

00:04:20.612 --> 00:04:23.446
they were carrying these
Whole Earth banners and so on --

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.164
I did that with no work.

00:04:26.188 --> 00:04:28.440
I sold those buttons for 25 cents apiece.

00:04:28.464 --> 00:04:31.893
So, you know, tweaking the system

00:04:32.945 --> 00:04:36.144
is, I think, not only the most efficient
way to make the system go

00:04:36.168 --> 00:04:37.335
in interesting ways,

00:04:37.359 --> 00:04:39.027
but in some ways, the safest way,

00:04:39.051 --> 00:04:42.526
because when you try to horse
the whole system around in a big way,

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.503
you can get into big
horsing-around problems,

00:04:45.527 --> 00:04:48.355
but if you tweak it,
it will adjust to the tweak.

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:50.485
CA: So since then,
among many other things,

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:53.836
you've been regarded as a leading voice
in the environmental movement,

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.796
but you are also a counterculturalist,

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.246
and recently, you've been
taking on a lot of,

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.616
well, you've been declaring

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.492
what a lot of environmentalists
almost believe are heresies.

00:05:03.516 --> 00:05:05.642
I kind of want to explore
a couple of those.

00:05:05.666 --> 00:05:07.529
I mean, tell me about this image here.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.996
SB: Ha-ha!

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.943
That's a National Geographic image

00:05:12.967 --> 00:05:16.086
of what is called the mammoth steppe,

00:05:16.635 --> 00:05:20.394
what the far north, the sub-Arctic
and Arctic region, used to look like.

00:05:20.824 --> 00:05:23.720
In fact, the whole world
used to look like that.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.596
What we find in South Africa
and the Serengeti now,

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.254
lots of big animals,

00:05:29.278 --> 00:05:32.650
was the case in this part of Canada,

00:05:32.674 --> 00:05:35.614
throughout the US, throughout Eurasia,
throughout the world.

00:05:35.638 --> 00:05:36.841
This was the norm

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.588
and can be again.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.311
So in a sense,

00:05:42.335 --> 00:05:47.969
my long-term goal at this point
is to not only bring back those animals

00:05:47.993 --> 00:05:50.079
and the grassland they made,

00:05:50.103 --> 00:05:55.479
which could be a climate
stabilization system over the long run,

00:05:55.503 --> 00:05:57.803
but even the mammoths
there in the background

00:05:57.827 --> 00:05:59.574
that are part of the story.

00:05:59.598 --> 00:06:03.566
And I think that's probably
a 200-year goal.

00:06:04.183 --> 00:06:06.712
Maybe in 100, by the end of this century,

00:06:06.736 --> 00:06:09.098
we should be able to dial down
the extinction rate

00:06:09.122 --> 00:06:11.188
to sort of what it's been
in the background.

00:06:11.212 --> 00:06:14.049
Bringing back this amount
of bio-abundance will take longer,

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:15.230
but it's worth doing.

00:06:15.254 --> 00:06:16.997
CA: We'll come back to the mammoths,

00:06:17.021 --> 00:06:20.765
but explain how we
should think of extinctions.

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:24.058
Obviously, one of the huge
concerns right now

00:06:24.082 --> 00:06:28.928
is that extinction is happening
at a faster rate than ever in history.

00:06:28.952 --> 00:06:31.357
That's the meme that's out there.

00:06:31.381 --> 00:06:32.745
How should we think of it?

00:06:33.145 --> 00:06:34.681
SB: The story that's out there

00:06:34.705 --> 00:06:37.367
is that we're in the middle
of the Sixth Extinction

00:06:37.391 --> 00:06:39.891
or maybe in the beginning
of the Sixth Extinction.

00:06:39.915 --> 00:06:42.142
Because we're in
the de-extinction business,

00:06:42.166 --> 00:06:45.231
the preventing-extinction business
with Revive &amp; Restore,

00:06:45.255 --> 00:06:48.322
we started looking at what's actually
going on with extinction.

00:06:48.346 --> 00:06:52.678
And it turns out, there's a very confused
set of data out there

00:06:52.702 --> 00:06:55.095
which gets oversimplified

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:58.171
into the narrative of we're becoming ...

00:06:58.195 --> 00:07:03.849
Here are five mass extinctions that are
indicated by the yellow triangles,

00:07:03.873 --> 00:07:06.836
and we're now next.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.713
The last one there on the far right

00:07:08.737 --> 00:07:11.888
was the meteor that struck
66 million years ago

00:07:11.912 --> 00:07:13.361
and did in the dinosaurs.

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:16.250
And the story is, we're the next meteor.

00:07:17.494 --> 00:07:18.673
Well, here's the deal.

00:07:18.697 --> 00:07:21.612
I wound up researching this
for a paper I wrote,

00:07:21.636 --> 00:07:27.513
that a mass extinction is when
75 percent of all the species

00:07:27.537 --> 00:07:29.059
in the world go extinct.

00:07:31.163 --> 00:07:34.320
Well, there's on the order
of five-and-a-half-million species,

00:07:34.344 --> 00:07:36.852
of which we've identified
one and a half million.

00:07:36.876 --> 00:07:39.812
Another 14,000 are being
identified every year.

00:07:39.836 --> 00:07:42.071
There's a lot of biology
going on out there.

00:07:42.584 --> 00:07:44.396
Since 1500,

00:07:45.587 --> 00:07:48.178
about 500 species have gone extinct,

00:07:49.077 --> 00:07:53.055
and you'll see the term "mass extinction"
kind of used in strange ways.

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:55.810
So there was, about a year and a half ago,

00:07:55.834 --> 00:07:58.883
a front-page story by Carl Zimmer
in the New York Times,

00:07:58.907 --> 00:08:01.993
"Mass Extinction in the Oceans,
Broad Studies Show."

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.283
And then you read into the article,
and it mentions that since 1500,

00:08:06.307 --> 00:08:11.266
15 species -- one, five --
have gone extinct in the oceans,

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.026
and, oh, by the way,
none in the last 50 years.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.599
And you read further
into the story, and it's saying,

00:08:16.623 --> 00:08:18.384
the horrifying thing that's going on

00:08:18.408 --> 00:08:22.264
is that the fisheries
are so overfishing the wild fishes,

00:08:22.288 --> 00:08:25.826
that it is taking down
the fish populations in the oceans

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.139
by 38 percent.

00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:29.554
That's the serious thing.

00:08:29.578 --> 00:08:32.398
None of those species
are probably going to go extinct.

00:08:32.422 --> 00:08:36.371
So you've just put, that headline writer

00:08:36.395 --> 00:08:38.616
put a panic button

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.137
on the top of the story.

00:08:40.161 --> 00:08:41.932
It's clickbait kind of stuff,

00:08:41.956 --> 00:08:45.046
but it's basically saying,
"Oh my God, start panicking,

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.564
we're going to lose
all the species in the oceans."

00:08:47.588 --> 00:08:50.203
Nothing like that is in prospect.

00:08:50.842 --> 00:08:54.554
And in fact, what I then started
looking into in a little more detail,

00:08:55.379 --> 00:08:59.483
the Red List shows about 23,000 species
that are considered threatened

00:08:59.507 --> 00:09:00.837
at one level or another,

00:09:00.861 --> 00:09:04.745
coming from the International Union
for the Conservation of Nature, the IUCN.

00:09:04.769 --> 00:09:09.790
And Nature Magazine had a piece
surveying the loss of wildlife,

00:09:09.814 --> 00:09:10.982
and it said,

00:09:11.006 --> 00:09:14.147
"If all of those 23,000 went extinct

00:09:14.171 --> 00:09:16.110
in the next century or so,

00:09:16.134 --> 00:09:21.019
and that rate of extinction carried on
for more centuries and millennia,

00:09:21.043 --> 00:09:25.296
then we might be at the beginning
of a sixth extinction.

00:09:25.945 --> 00:09:27.949
So the exaggeration is way out of hand.

00:09:27.973 --> 00:09:29.890
But environmentalists always exaggerate.

00:09:29.914 --> 00:09:31.083
That's a problem.

00:09:31.107 --> 00:09:34.263
CA: I mean, they probably feel
a moral responsibility to,

00:09:34.287 --> 00:09:37.488
because they care so much about
the thing that they are looking at,

00:09:37.512 --> 00:09:40.447
and unless you bang the drum for it,
maybe no one listens.

00:09:40.471 --> 00:09:43.568
SB: Every time somebody says
moral this or moral that --

00:09:43.592 --> 00:09:46.531
"moral hazard,"
"precautionary principle" --

00:09:46.555 --> 00:09:50.623
these are terms that are used
to basically say no to things.

00:09:51.486 --> 00:09:55.192
CA: So the problem isn't so much
fish extinction, animal extinction,

00:09:55.216 --> 00:09:58.007
it's fish flourishing, animal flourishing,

00:09:58.031 --> 00:10:00.533
that we're crowding them to some extent?

00:10:00.557 --> 00:10:04.816
SB: Yeah, and I think we are crowding,
and there is losses going on.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.884
The major losses
are caused by agriculture,

00:10:07.908 --> 00:10:13.525
and so anything that improves agriculture
and basically makes it more condensed,

00:10:13.549 --> 00:10:15.251
more highly productive,

00:10:15.275 --> 00:10:17.254
including GMOs, please,

00:10:17.278 --> 00:10:19.814
but even if you want to do
vertical farms in town,

00:10:19.838 --> 00:10:21.101
including inside farms,

00:10:21.125 --> 00:10:24.756
all the things that have been learned
about how to grow pot in basements,

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.961
is now being applied to growing
vegetables inside containers --

00:10:27.985 --> 00:10:29.853
that's great, that's all good stuff,

00:10:29.877 --> 00:10:33.909
because land sparing is the main thing
we can do for nature.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.086
People moving to cities is good.

00:10:36.424 --> 00:10:41.186
Making agriculture less
of a destruction of the landscape is good.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:44.415
CA: There people talking about
bringing back species, rewilding ...

00:10:44.439 --> 00:10:47.965
Well, first of all, rewilding species:
What's the story with these guys?

00:10:47.989 --> 00:10:49.702
SB: Ha-ha! Wolves.

00:10:50.433 --> 00:10:53.618
Europe, connecting to the previous point,

00:10:53.642 --> 00:10:56.001
we're now at probably peak farmland,

00:10:56.025 --> 00:10:57.965
and, by the way, in terms of population,

00:10:57.989 --> 00:11:00.565
we are already
at peak children being alive.

00:11:00.589 --> 00:11:03.074
Henceforth, there will be
fewer and fewer children.

00:11:03.098 --> 00:11:06.709
We are in the last doubling
of human population,

00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:10.837
and it will get to nine,
maybe nine and a half billion,

00:11:10.861 --> 00:11:14.256
and then start not just leveling off,
but probably going down.

00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:17.631
Likewise, farmland has now peaked,

00:11:17.655 --> 00:11:21.175
and one of the ways
that plays out in Europe

00:11:21.199 --> 00:11:24.251
is there's a lot
of abandoned farmland now,

00:11:24.275 --> 00:11:26.028
which immediately reforests.

00:11:26.052 --> 00:11:28.463
They don't do wildlife
corridors in Europe.

00:11:28.923 --> 00:11:32.021
They don't need to, because
so many of these farms are connected

00:11:32.045 --> 00:11:35.032
that they've made
reforested wildlife corridors,

00:11:35.056 --> 00:11:38.151
that the wolves are coming back,
in this case, to Spain.

00:11:38.175 --> 00:11:40.717
They've gotten all the way
to the Netherlands.

00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:44.297
There's bears coming back.
There's lynx coming back.

00:11:44.321 --> 00:11:47.502
There's the European jackal.
I had no idea such a thing existed.

00:11:47.526 --> 00:11:50.093
They're coming back from Italy
to the rest of Europe.

00:11:50.117 --> 00:11:53.608
And unlike here, these are all predators,
which is kind of interesting.

00:11:53.632 --> 00:11:57.047
They are being welcomed by Europeans.
They've been missed.

00:11:57.071 --> 00:12:00.068
CA: And counterintuitively,
when you bring back the predators,

00:12:00.092 --> 00:12:02.204
it actually increases rather than reduces

00:12:02.228 --> 00:12:04.491
the diversity of the underlying
ecosystem often.

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:08.271
SB: Yeah, generally predators
and large animals --

00:12:08.295 --> 00:12:11.537
large animals and large animals
with sharp teeth and claws --

00:12:11.561 --> 00:12:16.667
are turning out to be highly important
for a really rich ecosystem.

00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:20.639
CA: Which maybe brings us to this rather
more dramatic rewilding project

00:12:20.663 --> 00:12:22.552
that you've got yourself involved in.

00:12:22.576 --> 00:12:25.972
Why would someone want to bring back
these terrifying woolly mammoths?

00:12:25.996 --> 00:12:28.870
SB: Hmm. Asian elephants
are the closest relative

00:12:28.894 --> 00:12:31.187
to the woolly mammoth,

00:12:31.211 --> 00:12:34.100
and they're about the same size,
genetically very close.

00:12:34.124 --> 00:12:38.177
They diverged quite recently
in evolutionary history.

00:12:38.201 --> 00:12:40.584
The Asian elephants
are closer to woolly mammoths

00:12:40.608 --> 00:12:42.403
than they are to African elephants,

00:12:42.427 --> 00:12:44.634
but they're close enough
to African elephants

00:12:44.658 --> 00:12:46.707
that they have successfully hybridized.

00:12:47.486 --> 00:12:51.144
So we're working
with George Church at Harvard,

00:12:51.168 --> 00:12:55.237
who has already moved the genes
for four major traits

00:12:55.261 --> 00:13:01.333
from the now well-preserved, well-studied
genome of the woolly mammoth,

00:13:01.357 --> 00:13:04.305
thanks to so-called
"ancient DNA analysis."

00:13:05.178 --> 00:13:10.961
And in the lab, he has moved those genes
into living Asian elephant cell lines,

00:13:10.985 --> 00:13:14.276
where they're taking up
their proper place thanks to CRISPR.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.135
I mean, they're not shooting the genes in
like you did with genetic engineering.

00:13:18.159 --> 00:13:21.448
Now with CRISPR you're editing,
basically, one allele,

00:13:21.472 --> 00:13:24.792
and replacing it in the place
of another allele.

00:13:25.352 --> 00:13:31.655
So you're now getting basically
Asian elephant germline cells

00:13:31.679 --> 00:13:35.529
that are effectively in terms
of the traits that you're going for

00:13:35.553 --> 00:13:38.057
to be comfortable in the Arctic,

00:13:38.899 --> 00:13:40.346
you're getting them in there.

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:41.970
So we go through the process

00:13:41.994 --> 00:13:44.678
of getting that through
a surrogate mother,

00:13:44.702 --> 00:13:46.245
an Asian elephant mother.

00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:50.967
You can get a proxy, as it's being called
by conservation biologists,

00:13:50.991 --> 00:13:52.392
of the woolly mammoth,

00:13:52.416 --> 00:13:57.603
that is effectively a hairy,
curly-trunked, Asian elephant

00:13:57.627 --> 00:14:00.572
that is perfectly comfortable
in the sub-Arctic.

00:14:00.596 --> 00:14:02.687
Now, it's the case, so many people say,

00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:04.719
"Well, how are you going
to get them there?

00:14:04.743 --> 00:14:07.110
And Asian elephants,
they don't like snow, right?"

00:14:07.134 --> 00:14:09.018
Well, it turns out, they do like snow.

00:14:09.042 --> 00:14:10.582
There's some in an Ontario zoo

00:14:10.606 --> 00:14:12.889
that have made snowballs
bigger than people.

00:14:12.913 --> 00:14:16.383
They just love -- you know, with a trunk,
you can start a little thing,

00:14:16.407 --> 00:14:18.049
roll it and make it bigger.

00:14:18.749 --> 00:14:20.024
And then people say,

00:14:20.048 --> 00:14:23.518
"Yeah, but it's 22 months of gestation.

00:14:25.733 --> 00:14:30.274
This kind of cross-species cloning
is tricky business, anyway.

00:14:30.298 --> 00:14:33.563
Are you going to lose some of
the surrogate Asian elephant mothers?"

00:14:33.587 --> 00:14:35.790
And then George Church
says, "That's all right.

00:14:35.814 --> 00:14:38.382
We'll do an artificial uterus
and grow them that way."

00:14:38.406 --> 00:14:40.676
Then people say, "Yeah,
next century, maybe,"

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.954
except the news came out
this week in Nature

00:14:42.978 --> 00:14:47.301
that there's now an artificial uterus
in which they've grown a lamb

00:14:47.325 --> 00:14:48.762
to four weeks.

00:14:48.786 --> 00:14:51.510
That's halfway through
its gestation period.

00:14:52.067 --> 00:14:54.339
So this stuff is moving right along.

00:14:54.363 --> 00:14:57.112
CA: But why should we
want a world where --

00:14:57.136 --> 00:14:59.855
Picture a world where there are
thousands of these things

00:14:59.879 --> 00:15:01.836
thundering across Siberia.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:03.134
Is that a better world?

00:15:03.158 --> 00:15:04.959
SB: Potentially. It's --

00:15:04.983 --> 00:15:06.602
(Laughter)

00:15:06.626 --> 00:15:11.621
There's three groups, basically,
working on the woolly mammoth seriously:

00:15:11.645 --> 00:15:13.931
Revive &amp; Restore,
we're kind of in the middle;

00:15:13.955 --> 00:15:17.646
George Church and the group at Harvard
that are doing the genetics in the lab;

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:23.827
and then there's an amazing
old scientist named Zimov

00:15:23.851 --> 00:15:28.091
who works in northern Siberia,

00:15:28.115 --> 00:15:31.239
and his son Nikita,
who has bought into the system,

00:15:31.263 --> 00:15:37.573
and they are, Sergey and Nikita
Zimov have been, for 25 years,

00:15:37.597 --> 00:15:40.004
creating what they call
"Pleistocene Park,"

00:15:40.028 --> 00:15:44.913
which is a place in a really tough part
of Siberia that is pure tundra.

00:15:45.858 --> 00:15:48.226
And the research that's been done shows

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:53.579
that there's probably one one-hundredth
of the animals on the landscape there

00:15:53.603 --> 00:15:54.976
that there used to be.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.456
Like that earlier image,
we saw lots of animals.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.778
Now there's almost none.

00:15:59.199 --> 00:16:02.748
The tundra is mostly moss,
and then there's the boreal forest.

00:16:02.772 --> 00:16:05.900
And that's the way it is, folks.
There's just a few animals there.

00:16:05.924 --> 00:16:08.070
So they brought in
a lot of grazing animals:

00:16:08.094 --> 00:16:11.199
musk ox, Yakutian horses,
they're bringing in some bison,

00:16:11.223 --> 00:16:13.011
they're bringing in some more now,

00:16:13.035 --> 00:16:16.211
and put them in at the density
that they used to be.

00:16:16.235 --> 00:16:19.227
And grasslands are made by grazers.

00:16:19.251 --> 00:16:22.842
So these animals are there, grazing away,

00:16:22.866 --> 00:16:24.722
and they're doing a couple of things.

00:16:24.746 --> 00:16:28.418
First of all, they're turning the tundra,
the moss, back into grassland.

00:16:28.442 --> 00:16:30.263
Grassland fixes carbon.

00:16:30.287 --> 00:16:35.097
Tundra, in a warming world, is thawing
and releasing a lot of carbon dioxide

00:16:35.121 --> 00:16:36.820
and also methane.

00:16:36.844 --> 00:16:39.741
So already in their little
25 square miles,

00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:42.055
they're doing a climate
stabilization thing.

00:16:42.596 --> 00:16:44.608
Part of that story, though,

00:16:44.632 --> 00:16:49.501
is that the boreal forest is
very absorbent to sunlight,

00:16:49.525 --> 00:16:52.120
even in the winter
when snow is on the ground.

00:16:52.144 --> 00:16:53.800
And the way the mammoth steppe,

00:16:53.824 --> 00:16:56.447
which used to wrap all the way
around the North Pole --

00:16:56.471 --> 00:16:58.859
there's a lot of landmass
around the North Pole --

00:16:58.883 --> 00:17:01.634
that was all this grassland.

00:17:01.658 --> 00:17:04.279
And the steppe was magnificent,

00:17:04.303 --> 00:17:08.609
probably one of the most productive
biomes in the world,

00:17:08.633 --> 00:17:10.291
the biggest biome in the world.

00:17:11.052 --> 00:17:15.210
The forest part of it, right now,
Sergey Zimov and Nikita

00:17:15.234 --> 00:17:18.476
go out with this old military tank
they got for nothing,

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.248
and they knock down the trees.

00:17:20.272 --> 00:17:23.274
And that's a bore, and it's tiresome,

00:17:23.298 --> 00:17:26.121
and as Sergey says,
"... and they make no dung!"

00:17:26.145 --> 00:17:29.854
which, by the way, these big
animals do, including mammoths.

00:17:29.878 --> 00:17:32.800
So mammoths become
what conservation biologists call

00:17:32.824 --> 00:17:34.287
an umbrella species.

00:17:34.311 --> 00:17:37.973
It's an exciting animal --
pandas in China or wherever --

00:17:37.997 --> 00:17:42.324
that the excitement that goes on
of making life good for that animal

00:17:42.348 --> 00:17:44.560
is making a habitat, an ecosystem,

00:17:44.584 --> 00:17:47.405
which is good for a whole lot
of creatures and plants,

00:17:47.429 --> 00:17:50.723
and it ideally gets to the point
of being self-managing,

00:17:50.747 --> 00:17:53.334
where the conservation biologists
can back off and say,

00:17:53.358 --> 00:17:56.333
"All we have to do is keep out
the destructive invasives,

00:17:56.357 --> 00:17:57.997
and this thing can just cook."

00:17:58.585 --> 00:18:02.386
CA: So there's many other species
that you're dreaming of de-extincting

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:03.644
at some point,

00:18:03.668 --> 00:18:06.684
but I think what I'd actually
like to move on to

00:18:06.708 --> 00:18:10.132
is this idea you talked about
how mammoths might help

00:18:10.156 --> 00:18:12.562
green Siberia in a sense,

00:18:12.586 --> 00:18:18.495
or at least, I'm not talking about
tropical rainforest,

00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:22.400
but this question of greening the planet
you've thought about a lot.

00:18:22.424 --> 00:18:24.592
And the traditional story is

00:18:24.616 --> 00:18:30.874
that deforestation
is one of the most awful curses

00:18:30.898 --> 00:18:32.471
of modern times,

00:18:32.495 --> 00:18:36.350
and that it's a huge contributor
to climate change.

00:18:36.374 --> 00:18:39.856
And then you went and sent me
this graph here, or this map.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.242
What is this map?

00:18:41.266 --> 00:18:42.674
SB: Global greening.

00:18:43.284 --> 00:18:47.699
The thing to do with any narrative
that you get from headlines

00:18:47.723 --> 00:18:49.602
and from short news stories

00:18:49.626 --> 00:18:51.599
is to look for what else is going on,

00:18:52.327 --> 00:18:56.921
and look for what Marc Andreessen
calls "narrative violation."

00:18:57.416 --> 00:19:02.655
So the narrative -- and Al Gore
is master of putting it out there --

00:19:02.679 --> 00:19:06.766
is that there's this
civilization-threatening

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.912
climate change coming on very rapidly.

00:19:08.936 --> 00:19:14.998
We have to cease all extra production
of greenhouse gases, especially CO2,

00:19:15.022 --> 00:19:16.178
as soon as possible,

00:19:16.202 --> 00:19:18.741
otherwise, we're in deep, deep trouble.

00:19:18.765 --> 00:19:21.183
All of that is true,
but it's not the whole story,

00:19:21.207 --> 00:19:24.763
and the whole story is more interesting
than these fragmentary stories.

00:19:25.548 --> 00:19:27.847
Plants love CO2.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:32.220
What plants are made of is CO2
plus water via sunshine.

00:19:32.985 --> 00:19:37.830
And so in many greenhouses,
industrialized greenhouses,

00:19:37.854 --> 00:19:41.120
they add CO2 because the plants
turn that into plant matter.

00:19:41.144 --> 00:19:44.174
So the studies have been done
with satellites and other things,

00:19:44.198 --> 00:19:48.270
and what you're seeing here is a graph of,
over the last 33 years or so,

00:19:48.294 --> 00:19:54.458
there's 14 percent more
leaf action going on.

00:19:54.482 --> 00:19:56.086
There's that much more biomass.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:59.252
There's that much more
what ecologists call "primary production."

00:19:59.276 --> 00:20:01.221
There's that much more life happening,

00:20:01.245 --> 00:20:02.541
thanks to climate change,

00:20:02.565 --> 00:20:05.417
thanks to all of our goddam coal plants.

00:20:05.441 --> 00:20:08.211
So -- whoa, what's going on here?

00:20:08.235 --> 00:20:11.850
By the way, crop production
goes up with this.

00:20:11.874 --> 00:20:16.152
This is a partial counter

00:20:16.176 --> 00:20:19.436
to the increase of CO2,

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.821
because there's that much more plant
that is sucking it down

00:20:22.845 --> 00:20:24.180
into plant matter.

00:20:24.204 --> 00:20:26.502
Some of that then decays
and goes right back up,

00:20:26.526 --> 00:20:28.468
but some of it is going down into roots

00:20:28.492 --> 00:20:30.538
and going into the soil and staying there.

00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:34.425
So these counter things are part
of what you need to bear in mind,

00:20:34.449 --> 00:20:36.166
and the deeper story is

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:41.047
that thinking about and dealing with
and engineering climate

00:20:41.071 --> 00:20:43.288
is a pretty complex process.

00:20:43.857 --> 00:20:45.563
It's like medicine.

00:20:45.587 --> 00:20:48.807
You're always, again,
tweaking around with the system

00:20:48.831 --> 00:20:50.807
to see what makes an improvement.

00:20:50.831 --> 00:20:53.519
Then you do more of that,
see it's still getting better,

00:20:53.543 --> 00:20:56.000
then -- oop! -- that's enough,
back off half a turn.

00:20:56.024 --> 00:20:59.032
CA: But might some people say,
"Not all green is created equal."

00:20:59.056 --> 00:21:02.589
Possibly what we're doing is trading off
the magnificence of the rainforest

00:21:02.613 --> 00:21:03.765
and all that diversity

00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:06.989
for, I don't know, green pond scum
or grass or something like that.

00:21:07.013 --> 00:21:10.661
SB: In this particular study, it turns out
every form of plant is increasing.

00:21:10.685 --> 00:21:12.939
Now, what's interestingly
left out of this study

00:21:12.963 --> 00:21:14.989
is what the hell is going on
in the oceans.

00:21:15.013 --> 00:21:16.831
Primary production in the oceans,

00:21:16.855 --> 00:21:19.987
the biota of the oceans, mostly microbial,

00:21:20.011 --> 00:21:22.695
what they're up to is probably
the most important thing.

00:21:22.719 --> 00:21:24.767
They're the ones
that create the atmosphere

00:21:24.791 --> 00:21:26.598
that we're happily breathing,

00:21:26.622 --> 00:21:28.443
and they're not part of this study.

00:21:29.051 --> 00:21:31.957
This is one of the things
James Lovelock has been insisting;

00:21:31.981 --> 00:21:35.412
basically, our knowledge of the oceans,
especially of ocean life,

00:21:35.436 --> 00:21:37.563
is fundamentally vapor, in this sense.

00:21:37.587 --> 00:21:39.627
So we're in the process of finding out

00:21:39.651 --> 00:21:44.890
by inadvertent bad geoengineering
of too much CO2 in the atmosphere,

00:21:44.914 --> 00:21:47.245
finding out, what is
the ocean doing with that?

00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:49.167
Well, the ocean, with the extra heat,

00:21:49.191 --> 00:21:50.492
is swelling up.

00:21:50.516 --> 00:21:53.054
That's most of where we're getting
the sea level rise,

00:21:53.078 --> 00:21:55.710
and there's a lot more coming
with more global warming.

00:21:55.734 --> 00:22:00.152
We're getting terrible harm
to some of the coral reefs,

00:22:00.176 --> 00:22:01.977
like off of Australia.

00:22:02.509 --> 00:22:06.818
The great reef there is just
a lot of bleaching from overheating.

00:22:06.842 --> 00:22:13.297
And this is why I and Danny Hillis,
in our previous session on the main stage,

00:22:13.321 --> 00:22:17.687
was saying, "Look, geoengineering
is worth experimenting with enough

00:22:17.711 --> 00:22:19.197
to see that it works,

00:22:19.221 --> 00:22:23.696
to see if we can buy time
in the warming aspect of all of this,

00:22:24.264 --> 00:22:29.031
tweak the system with small
but usable research,

00:22:29.055 --> 00:22:31.367
and then see if we should
do more than tweak.

00:22:32.119 --> 00:22:34.512
CA: OK, so this is what
we're going to talk about

00:22:34.536 --> 00:22:35.971
for the last few minutes here

00:22:35.995 --> 00:22:38.041
because it's such an important discussion.

00:22:38.065 --> 00:22:41.810
First of all, this book
was just published by Yuval Harari.

00:22:41.834 --> 00:22:45.979
He's basically saying the next evolution
of humans is to become as gods.

00:22:46.003 --> 00:22:47.154
I think he --

00:22:47.178 --> 00:22:50.490
SB: Now, you've talked to him.
And you've probably finished the book.

00:22:50.514 --> 00:22:51.800
I haven't finished it yet.

00:22:51.824 --> 00:22:53.286
Where does he come out on --

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:57.472
CA: I mean, it's a pretty radical view.

00:22:57.496 --> 00:23:00.920
He thinks that we will
completely remake ourselves

00:23:00.944 --> 00:23:04.419
using data, using bioengineering,

00:23:04.443 --> 00:23:06.583
to become completely new creatures

00:23:06.607 --> 00:23:08.633
that have, kind of, superpowers,

00:23:08.657 --> 00:23:11.889
and that there will be huge inequality.

00:23:11.913 --> 00:23:17.186
But we're about to write a very radical,
brand-new chapter of history.

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:18.782
That's what he believes.

00:23:18.806 --> 00:23:20.749
SB: Is he nervous about that? I forget.

00:23:20.773 --> 00:23:23.214
CA: He's nervous about it,

00:23:23.238 --> 00:23:26.130
but I think he also
likes provoking people.

00:23:26.154 --> 00:23:28.139
SB: Are you nervous about that?

00:23:28.163 --> 00:23:29.581
CA: I'm nervous about that.

00:23:29.605 --> 00:23:33.670
But, you know, with so much at TED,
I'm excited and nervous.

00:23:33.694 --> 00:23:37.450
And the optimist in me
is trying hard to lean towards

00:23:37.474 --> 00:23:39.562
"This is awesome and really exciting,"

00:23:39.586 --> 00:23:42.025
while the sort of responsible
part of me is saying,

00:23:42.049 --> 00:23:44.388
"But, uh, maybe we should
be a little bit careful

00:23:44.412 --> 00:23:45.735
as to how we think of it."

00:23:45.759 --> 00:23:48.131
SB: That's your secret sauce,
isn't it, for TED?

00:23:48.155 --> 00:23:49.731
Staying nervous and excited.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:54.098
CA: It's also the recipe for being
a little bit schizophrenic.

00:23:54.122 --> 00:23:58.807
But he didn't quote you.

00:23:58.831 --> 00:24:01.571
What I thought was an astonishing
statement that you made

00:24:01.595 --> 00:24:05.848
right back in the original
Whole Earth Catalog,

00:24:05.872 --> 00:24:09.072
you ended it with this powerful phrase:

00:24:09.096 --> 00:24:12.537
"We are as gods,
and might as well get good at it."

00:24:12.561 --> 00:24:15.233
And then more recently,
you've upgraded that statement.

00:24:15.257 --> 00:24:17.081
I want you talk about this philosophy.

00:24:17.105 --> 00:24:20.720
SB: Well, one of the things I'm learning
is that documentation

00:24:20.744 --> 00:24:23.736
is better than memory -- by far.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.725
And one of the things I've learned
from somebody --

00:24:26.749 --> 00:24:29.404
I actually got on Twitter.

00:24:29.428 --> 00:24:33.128
It changed my life --
it hasn't forgiven me yet!

00:24:33.152 --> 00:24:37.154
And I took ownership of this phrase
when somebody quoted it,

00:24:37.178 --> 00:24:38.734
and somebody else said,

00:24:38.758 --> 00:24:41.221
"Oh by the way, that isn't
what you originally wrote

00:24:41.245 --> 00:24:44.012
in that first 1968 Whole Earth Catalog.

00:24:44.036 --> 00:24:47.104
You wrote, 'We are as gods
and might as well get used to it.'"

00:24:47.128 --> 00:24:49.389
I'd forgotten that entirely.

00:24:49.413 --> 00:24:52.776
The stories -- these goddam stories --
the stories we tell ourselves

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.616
become lies over time.

00:24:55.076 --> 00:24:57.869
So, documentation helps cut through that.

00:24:57.893 --> 00:25:01.132
It did move on to "We are as gods
and might as well get good at it,"

00:25:01.156 --> 00:25:03.041
and that was the Whole Earth Catalog.

00:25:03.065 --> 00:25:06.129
By the time I was doing a book
called "Whole Earth Discipline:

00:25:06.153 --> 00:25:08.519
An Ecopragmatist Manifesto,"

00:25:08.543 --> 00:25:11.735
and in light of climate change,
basically saying that we are as gods

00:25:11.759 --> 00:25:13.358
and have to get good at it.

00:25:13.382 --> 00:25:15.646
CA: We are as gods
and have to get good at it.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:19.229
So talk about that, because
the psychological reaction

00:25:19.253 --> 00:25:22.407
from so many people as soon
as you talk about geoengineering

00:25:22.431 --> 00:25:25.692
is that the last thing they believe
is that humans should be gods --

00:25:25.716 --> 00:25:27.600
some of them for religious reasons,

00:25:27.624 --> 00:25:30.545
but most just for humility reasons,

00:25:30.569 --> 00:25:32.190
that the systems are too complex,

00:25:32.214 --> 00:25:34.873
we should not be dabbling that way.

00:25:35.642 --> 00:25:39.581
SB: Well, this is the Greek
narrative about hubris.

00:25:39.605 --> 00:25:42.872
And once you start getting
really sure of yourself,

00:25:42.896 --> 00:25:45.553
you wind up sleeping with your mother.

00:25:45.577 --> 00:25:48.195
(Laughter)

00:25:48.219 --> 00:25:50.220
CA: I did not expect you would say that.

00:25:50.244 --> 00:25:51.911
(Laughter)

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.188
SB: That's the Oedipus story.

00:25:56.212 --> 00:26:01.566
Hubris is a really important
cautionary tale to always have at hand.

00:26:03.734 --> 00:26:07.516
One of the guidelines
I've kept for myself is:

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:12.059
every day I ask myself how many things
I am dead wrong about.

00:26:13.393 --> 00:26:16.482
And I'm a scientist by training

00:26:16.506 --> 00:26:18.825
and getting to work
with scientists these days,

00:26:18.849 --> 00:26:20.096
which is pure joy.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.192
Science is organized skepticism.

00:26:24.042 --> 00:26:27.578
So you're always insisting

00:26:27.602 --> 00:26:31.001
that even when something
looks pretty good,

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:35.212
you maintain a full set
of not only suspicions

00:26:35.236 --> 00:26:37.331
about whether it's as good as it looks,

00:26:37.355 --> 00:26:38.952
but: What else is going on?

00:26:38.976 --> 00:26:42.298
So this "What else is going?" on query,

00:26:42.322 --> 00:26:46.425
I think, is how you get
away from fake news.

00:26:46.449 --> 00:26:48.953
It's not necessarily real news,

00:26:50.274 --> 00:26:54.323
but it's welcomely more complex news

00:26:54.347 --> 00:26:55.884
that you're trying to take on.

00:26:55.908 --> 00:26:59.369
CA: But coming back to the application
of this just for the environment:

00:26:59.393 --> 00:27:02.833
it seems like the philosophy of this
is that, whether we like it or not,

00:27:02.857 --> 00:27:06.300
we are already dominating so many aspects
of what happens on planets,

00:27:06.324 --> 00:27:08.016
and we're doing it unintentionally,

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:12.421
so we really should start
doing it intentionally.

00:27:12.445 --> 00:27:16.428
What would it look like to start
getting good at being a god?

00:27:16.452 --> 00:27:18.472
How should we start doing that?

00:27:18.496 --> 00:27:22.392
Are there small-scale experiments
or systems we can nudge and play with?

00:27:22.416 --> 00:27:24.375
How on earth do we think about it?

00:27:24.399 --> 00:27:26.202
SB: The mentor that sort of freed me

00:27:26.226 --> 00:27:28.506
from total allegiance
to Buckminster Fuller

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.306
was Gregory Bateson.

00:27:30.857 --> 00:27:37.379
And Gregory Bateson was an epistemologist
and anthropologist and biologist

00:27:37.403 --> 00:27:39.292
and psychologist and many other things,

00:27:39.316 --> 00:27:44.415
and he looked at how systems
basically look at themselves.

00:27:44.439 --> 00:27:49.954
And that is, I think, part of how
you want to always be looking at things.

00:27:49.978 --> 00:27:53.506
And what I like about David Keith's
approach to geoengineering

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:55.415
is you don't just haul off and do it.

00:27:56.093 --> 00:27:57.380
David Keith's approach --

00:27:57.404 --> 00:28:00.501
and this is what Danny Hillis
was talking about earlier --

00:28:00.525 --> 00:28:02.970
is that you do it really,
really incrementally,

00:28:02.994 --> 00:28:06.863
you do some stuff to tweak the system,
see how it responds,

00:28:06.887 --> 00:28:08.908
that tells you something about the system.

00:28:08.932 --> 00:28:13.345
That's responding to the fact
that people say, quite rightly,

00:28:13.369 --> 00:28:14.958
"What are we talking about here?

00:28:14.982 --> 00:28:17.359
We don't understand
how the climate system works.

00:28:17.383 --> 00:28:20.054
You can't engineer a system
you don't understand."

00:28:20.569 --> 00:28:23.752
And David says, "Well, that certainly
applies to the human body,

00:28:23.776 --> 00:28:27.558
and yet medicine goes ahead,
and we're kind of glad that it has."

00:28:27.582 --> 00:28:31.595
The way you engineer a system
that is so large and complex

00:28:31.619 --> 00:28:33.639
that you can't completely understand it

00:28:33.663 --> 00:28:34.857
is you tweak it,

00:28:34.881 --> 00:28:37.482
and this is kind of
an anti-hubristic approach.

00:28:37.506 --> 00:28:39.423
This is: try a little bit here,

00:28:39.447 --> 00:28:41.551
back the hell off if it's an issue,

00:28:41.575 --> 00:28:43.382
expand it if it seems to go OK,

00:28:43.406 --> 00:28:45.408
meanwhile, have other paths going forward.

00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:49.515
This is the whole argument for diversity
and dialogue and all these other things

00:28:49.539 --> 00:28:52.774
and the things we were hearing
about earlier with Sebastian [Thrun].

00:28:53.393 --> 00:28:59.883
So the non-hubristic approach
is looking for social license,

00:28:59.907 --> 00:29:02.448
which is a terminology
that I think is a good one,

00:29:02.472 --> 00:29:04.619
of including society enough

00:29:04.643 --> 00:29:08.644
in these interesting,
problematic, deep issues

00:29:08.668 --> 00:29:12.488
that they get to have a pretty good idea

00:29:12.512 --> 00:29:15.303
and have people that they trust
paying close attention

00:29:15.327 --> 00:29:19.151
to the sequence of experiments
as it's going forward,

00:29:19.175 --> 00:29:22.194
the public dialogue
as it's going forward --

00:29:22.218 --> 00:29:25.313
which is more public than ever,
which is fantastic --

00:29:25.337 --> 00:29:27.762
and you feel your way,

00:29:28.653 --> 00:29:30.336
you just ooze your way along,

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:34.970
and this is the muddle-through approach
that has worked pretty well so far.

00:29:34.994 --> 00:29:38.603
The reason that Sebastian
and I are optimistic is we read

00:29:38.627 --> 00:29:42.100
people like Steven Pinker,
"The Better Angels of Our Nature,"

00:29:42.124 --> 00:29:44.665
and so far, so good.

00:29:45.078 --> 00:29:48.179
Now, that can always change,

00:29:48.203 --> 00:29:53.818
but you can build a lot on that sense
of: things are capable of getting better,

00:29:54.587 --> 00:29:57.788
figure out the tools that made
that happen and apply those further.

00:29:57.812 --> 00:29:59.451
That's the story.

00:29:59.475 --> 00:30:01.780
CA: Stewart, I think
on that optimistic note,

00:30:01.804 --> 00:30:03.466
we're actually going to wrap up.

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:08.607
I am in awe of how you always
are willing to challenge yourself

00:30:08.631 --> 00:30:09.986
and other people.

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:15.791
I feel like this recipe for never
allowing yourself to be too certain

00:30:15.815 --> 00:30:17.218
is so powerful.

00:30:17.242 --> 00:30:19.173
I want to learn it more for myself,

00:30:19.197 --> 00:30:23.274
and it's been very insightful
and inspiring, actually,

00:30:23.298 --> 00:30:24.479
listening to you today.

00:30:24.503 --> 00:30:26.104
Stewart Brand, thank you so much.

00:30:26.128 --> 00:30:27.286
SB: Thank you.

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:30.429
(Applause)
