00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:08.894
We like to think of romantic feelings

00:00:08.918 --> 00:00:13.033
as spontaneous and indescribable
things that come from the heart.

00:00:13.057 --> 00:00:14.622
But it's actually your brain

00:00:14.646 --> 00:00:18.745
running a complex series of calculations
within a matter of seconds

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.483
that's responsible
for determining attraction.

00:00:21.507 --> 00:00:23.610
Doesn't sound quite as poetic, does it?

00:00:23.634 --> 00:00:26.788
But just because the calculations
are happening in your brain

00:00:26.812 --> 00:00:30.134
doesn't mean those warm,
fuzzy feelings are all in your head.

00:00:30.158 --> 00:00:32.651
In fact, all five
of your senses play a role,

00:00:32.674 --> 00:00:36.230
each able to vote for,
or veto, a budding attraction.

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.299
The eyes are the first
components in attraction.

00:00:39.323 --> 00:00:43.092
Many visual beauty standards vary
between cultures and eras,

00:00:43.116 --> 00:00:45.641
and signs of youth,
fertility and good health,

00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:47.458
such as long lustrous hair,

00:00:47.482 --> 00:00:49.827
or smooth, scar-free skin,

00:00:49.851 --> 00:00:51.288
are almost always in demand

00:00:51.312 --> 00:00:54.209
because they're associated
with reproductive fitness.

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:56.432
And when the eyes spot
something they like,

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:58.574
our instinct is to move closer

00:00:58.598 --> 00:01:00.618
so the other senses can investigate.

00:01:00.642 --> 00:01:02.795
The nose's contribution to romance

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:05.588
is more than noticing perfume or cologne.

00:01:05.612 --> 00:01:08.213
It's able to pick up
on natural chemical signals

00:01:08.237 --> 00:01:09.779
known as pheromones.

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.080
These not only convey

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:14.529
important physical or genetic information
about their source

00:01:14.553 --> 00:01:19.548
but are able to activate a physiological
or behavioral response in the recipient.

00:01:19.572 --> 00:01:21.926
In one study, a group of women

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.172
at different points
in their ovulation cycles

00:01:24.196 --> 00:01:26.501
wore the same T-shirts for three nights.

00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:28.981
After male volunteers
were randomly assigned

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:32.973
to smell either one of the worn shirts,
or a new unworn one,

00:01:32.997 --> 00:01:36.741
saliva samples showed
an increase in testosterone

00:01:36.765 --> 00:01:40.507
in those who had smelled a shirt worn
by an ovulating woman.

00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:42.175
Such a testosterone boost

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:44.744
may give a man the nudge to pursue a woman

00:01:44.768 --> 00:01:46.507
he might not have otherwise noticed.

00:01:47.028 --> 00:01:49.159
A woman's nose is particularly attuned

00:01:49.183 --> 00:01:53.116
to MHC molecules,
which are used to fight disease.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.593
In this case, opposites attract.

00:01:55.617 --> 00:02:00.032
When a study asked women to smell T-shirts
that had been worn by different men,

00:02:00.056 --> 00:02:05.152
they preferred the odors of those
whose MHC molecules differed from theirs.

00:02:05.176 --> 00:02:06.378
This makes sense.

00:02:06.402 --> 00:02:09.085
Genes that result in a greater
variety of immunities

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:11.719
may give offspring
a major survival advantage.

00:02:12.552 --> 00:02:14.636
Our ears also determine attraction.

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:18.520
Men prefer females
with high-pitched, breathy voices,

00:02:18.544 --> 00:02:22.840
and wide formant spacing,
correlated with smaller body size.

00:02:22.864 --> 00:02:27.292
While women prefer low-pitched voices
with a narrow formant spacing

00:02:27.316 --> 00:02:28.972
that suggest a larger body size.

00:02:29.694 --> 00:02:30.989
And not surprisingly,

00:02:31.013 --> 00:02:33.506
touch turns out to be crucial for romance.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.196
In this experiment,
not realizing the study had begun,

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.974
participants were asked
to briefly hold the coffee,

00:02:40.998 --> 00:02:42.722
either hot or iced.

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:46.250
Later, the participants read a story
about a hypothetical person,

00:02:46.274 --> 00:02:48.382
and were asked to rate their personality.

00:02:48.406 --> 00:02:50.819
Those who had held the hot cup of coffee

00:02:50.843 --> 00:02:53.714
perceived the person
in the story as happier,

00:02:53.738 --> 00:02:57.532
more social, more generous
and better-natured

00:02:57.556 --> 00:03:00.246
than those who had held
the cup of iced coffee,

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.794
who rated the person as cold,
stoic, and unaffectionate.

00:03:04.761 --> 00:03:07.847
If a potential mate has managed
to pass all these tests,

00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:09.354
there's still one more:

00:03:09.378 --> 00:03:11.955
the infamous first kiss,

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:16.484
a rich and complex exchange
of tactile and chemical cues,

00:03:16.508 --> 00:03:18.186
such as the smell of one's breath,

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.602
and the taste of their mouth.

00:03:20.094 --> 00:03:24.028
This magical moment is so critical
that a majority of men and women

00:03:24.052 --> 00:03:26.353
have reported losing
their attraction to someone

00:03:26.377 --> 00:03:28.040
after a bad first kiss.

00:03:28.762 --> 00:03:31.672
Once attraction is confirmed,
your bloodstream is flooded

00:03:31.696 --> 00:03:33.205
with norepinephrine,

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:35.517
activating your fight or flight system.

00:03:35.541 --> 00:03:37.139
Your heart beats faster,

00:03:37.163 --> 00:03:38.509
your pupils dilate,

00:03:38.533 --> 00:03:41.623
and your body releases glucose
for additional energy,

00:03:41.647 --> 00:03:44.775
not because you're in danger
but because your body is telling you

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.609
that something important is happening.

00:03:46.633 --> 00:03:47.804
To help you focus,

00:03:47.828 --> 00:03:50.306
norepinephrine creates
a sort of tunnel vision,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.601
blocking out surrounding distractions,

00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:55.023
possibly even warping your sense of time,

00:03:55.047 --> 00:03:57.129
and enhancing your memory.

00:03:57.153 --> 00:04:00.111
This might explain why people
never forget their first kiss.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.034
The idea of so much of our attraction

00:04:03.058 --> 00:04:06.299
being influenced by chemicals
and evolutionary biology

00:04:06.323 --> 00:04:09.015
may seem cold and scientific
rather than romantic,

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:11.335
but the next time
you see someone you like,

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.320
try to appreciate how your entire body
is playing matchmaker

00:04:15.344 --> 00:04:18.242
to decide if that beautiful
stranger is right for you.
