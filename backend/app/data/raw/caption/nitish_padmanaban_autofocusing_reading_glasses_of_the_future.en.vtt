00:00:12.875 --> 00:00:14.809
Every single one of us will lose

00:00:14.833 --> 00:00:18.684
or has already lost something
we rely on every single day.

00:00:18.708 --> 00:00:21.518
I am of course talking about our keys.

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:23.184
(Laughter)

00:00:23.208 --> 00:00:24.476
Just kidding.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.309
What I actually want to talk about is one
of our most important senses: vision.

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:31.143
Every single day we each lose
a little bit of our ability

00:00:31.167 --> 00:00:32.476
to refocus our eyes

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.809
until we can't refocus at all.

00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:36.809
We call this condition presbyopia,

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:39.351
and it affects two billion
people worldwide.

00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:41.518
That's right, I said billion.

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:43.268
If you haven't heard of presbyopia,

00:00:43.292 --> 00:00:46.101
and you're wondering,
"Where are these two billion people?"

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:48.226
here's a hint before
I get into the details.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.518
It's the reason why people wear
reading glasses or bifocal lenses.

00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:54.400
I'll get started by describing
the loss in refocusing ability

00:00:54.424 --> 00:00:55.934
leading up to presbyopia.

00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.184
As a newborn, you would have
been able to focus

00:00:58.208 --> 00:01:00.351
as close as six and a half centimeters,

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:01.643
if you wished to.

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:04.809
By your mid-20s, you have about
half of that focusing power left.

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:06.101
10 centimeters or so,

00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:08.684
but close enough that you never
notice the difference.

00:01:08.708 --> 00:01:09.976
By your late 40s though,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.351
the closest you can focus
is about 25 centimeters,

00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:13.643
maybe even farther.

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:15.768
Losses in focusing ability
beyond this point

00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:18.018
start affecting near-vision
tasks like reading,

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:19.643
and by the time you reach age 60,

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:22.018
nothing within a meter
radius of you is clear.

00:01:22.042 --> 00:01:24.309
Right now some of you
are probably thinking,

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:27.643
that sounds bad but he means
you in a figurative sense,

00:01:27.667 --> 00:01:31.101
only for the people that actually
end up with presbyopia.

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:35.559
But no, when I say you, I literally mean
that every single one of you

00:01:35.583 --> 00:01:38.809
will someday be presbyopic
if you aren't already.

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:40.226
That sounds a bit troubling.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.934
I want to remind you that presbyopia
has been with us for all of human history

00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.768
and we've done a lot
of different things to try and fix it.

00:01:46.792 --> 00:01:50.684
So to start, let's imagine
that you're sitting at a desk, reading.

00:01:50.708 --> 00:01:52.059
If you were presbyopic,

00:01:52.083 --> 00:01:54.143
it might look a little
something like this.

00:01:54.167 --> 00:01:57.059
Anything close by,
like the magazine, will be blurry.

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:58.434
Moving on to solutions.

00:01:58.458 --> 00:02:00.101
First, reading glasses.

00:02:00.125 --> 00:02:02.184
These have lenses
with a single focal power

00:02:02.208 --> 00:02:04.601
tuned so that near objects
come into focus.

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:07.226
But far objects
necessarily go out of focus,

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.726
meaning you have to constantly
switch back and forth

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.518
between wearing and not wearing them.

00:02:11.542 --> 00:02:12.809
To solve this problem

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:16.101
Benjamin Franklin invented
what he called "double spectacles."

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:18.226
Today we call those bifocals,

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.684
and what they let him do
was see far when he looked up

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:23.434
and see near when he looked down.

00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:26.434
Today we also have progressive lenses
which get rid of the line

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:29.059
by smoothly varying the focal power
from top to bottom.

00:02:29.083 --> 00:02:30.518
The downside to both of these

00:02:30.542 --> 00:02:33.143
is that you lose field of vision
at any given distance,

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:35.768
because it gets split up
from top to bottom like this.

00:02:35.792 --> 00:02:37.184
To see why that's a problem,

00:02:37.208 --> 00:02:40.059
imagine that you're climbing
down a ladder or stairs.

00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:43.684
You look down to get
your footing but it's blurry.

00:02:43.708 --> 00:02:45.101
Why would it be blurry?

00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:48.559
Well, you look down
and that's the near part of the lens,

00:02:48.583 --> 00:02:51.143
but the next step was past arm's reach,

00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:53.268
which for your eyes counts as far.

00:02:53.292 --> 00:02:56.184
The next solution I want to point out
is a little less common

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:58.601
but comes up in contact lenses
or LASIK surgeries,

00:02:58.625 --> 00:02:59.976
and it's called monovision.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.518
It works by setting up
the dominant eye to focus far

00:03:02.542 --> 00:03:04.143
and the other eye to focus near.

00:03:04.167 --> 00:03:06.976
Your brain does the work
of intelligently putting together

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.976
the sharpest parts from each eye's view,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.268
but the two eyes see
slightly different things,

00:03:11.292 --> 00:03:13.934
and that makes it harder
to judge distances binocularly.

00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.351
So where does that leave us?

00:03:15.375 --> 00:03:17.226
We've come up with a lot of solutions

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.851
but none of them quite restore
natural refocusing.

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:21.934
None of them let you
just look at something

00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.434
and expect it to be in focus.

00:03:23.458 --> 00:03:24.809
But why?

00:03:24.833 --> 00:03:26.101
Well, to explain that

00:03:26.125 --> 00:03:28.851
we'll want to take a look
at the anatomy of the human eye.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:32.101
The part of the eye that allows us
to refocus to different distances

00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:33.684
is called the crystalline lens.

00:03:33.708 --> 00:03:37.559
There are muscles surrounding the lens
that can deform it into different shapes,

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:39.684
which in turn changes its focusing power.

00:03:39.708 --> 00:03:42.184
What happens when someone
becomes presbyopic?

00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:44.434
It turns out that
the crystalline lens stiffens

00:03:44.458 --> 00:03:47.143
to the point that it doesn't
really change shape anymore.

00:03:47.167 --> 00:03:50.893
Now, thinking back
on all the solutions I listed earlier,

00:03:50.917 --> 00:03:54.643
we can see that they all have
something in common with the others

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:56.143
but not with our eyes,

00:03:56.167 --> 00:03:58.184
and that is that they're all static.

00:03:58.208 --> 00:04:01.101
It's like the optical equivalent
of a pirate with a peg leg.

00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:04.268
What is the optical equivalent
of a modern prosthetic leg?

00:04:04.292 --> 00:04:07.559
The last several decades have seen
the creation and rapid development

00:04:07.583 --> 00:04:10.268
of what are called "focus-tunable lenses."

00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:11.976
There are several different types.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.809
Mechanically-shifted Alvarez lenses,

00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:15.268
deformable liquid lenses

00:04:15.292 --> 00:04:17.851
and electronically-switched,
liquid crystal lenses.

00:04:17.875 --> 00:04:19.684
Now these have their own trade-offs,

00:04:19.708 --> 00:04:22.309
but what they don't skimp on
is the visual experience.

00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:25.601
Full-field-of-view vision that can be
sharp at any desired distance.

00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:27.768
OK, great. The lenses we need
already exist.

00:04:27.792 --> 00:04:29.684
Problem solved, right?

00:04:29.708 --> 00:04:31.143
Not so fast.

00:04:31.167 --> 00:04:34.143
Focus-tunable lenses add a bit
of complexity to the equation.

00:04:34.167 --> 00:04:38.018
The lenses don't have any way of knowing
what distance they should be focused to.

00:04:38.042 --> 00:04:39.351
What we need are glasses

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:41.934
that, when you're looking far,
far objects are sharp,

00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:43.268
and when you look near,

00:04:43.292 --> 00:04:45.726
near objects come into focus
in your field of view,

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.601
without you having to think about it.

00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:50.143
What I've worked on
these last few years at Stanford

00:04:50.167 --> 00:04:52.768
is building that exact intelligence
around the lenses.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:56.393
Our prototype borrows technology
from virtual and augmented reality systems

00:04:56.417 --> 00:04:57.934
to estimate focusing distance.

00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:01.601
We have an eye tracker that can tell
what direction our eyes are focused in.

00:05:01.625 --> 00:05:04.434
Using two of these, we can
triangulate your gaze direction

00:05:04.458 --> 00:05:05.768
to get a focus estimate.

00:05:05.792 --> 00:05:07.976
Just in case though,
to increase reliability,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.559
we also added a distance sensor.

00:05:09.583 --> 00:05:11.976
The sensor is a camera
that looks out at the world

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.601
and reports distances to objects.

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:16.601
We can again use your gaze direction
to get a distance estimate

00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:17.893
for a second time.

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:19.893
We then fuse those two distance estimates

00:05:19.917 --> 00:05:22.393
and update the focus-tunable
lens power accordingly.

00:05:22.417 --> 00:05:25.351
The next step for us was
to test our device on actual people.

00:05:25.375 --> 00:05:28.518
So we recruited about 100 presbyopes
and had them test our device

00:05:28.542 --> 00:05:30.351
while we measured their performance.

00:05:30.375 --> 00:05:33.643
What we saw convinced us right then
that autofocals were the future.

00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:37.018
Our participants could see more clearly,
they could focus more quickly

00:05:37.042 --> 00:05:40.059
and they thought it was an easier
and better focusing experience

00:05:40.083 --> 00:05:41.559
than their current correction.

00:05:41.583 --> 00:05:43.643
To put it simply, when it comes to vision,

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:46.893
autofocals don't compromise
like static corrections in use today do.

00:05:46.917 --> 00:05:48.851
But I don't want to get ahead of myself.

00:05:48.875 --> 00:05:51.601
There's a lot of work
for my colleagues and me left to do.

00:05:51.625 --> 00:05:53.893
For example, our glasses are a bit --

00:05:53.917 --> 00:05:54.934
(Laughter)

00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:56.309
bulky, maybe?

00:05:56.333 --> 00:05:59.684
And one reason for this
is that we used bulkier components

00:05:59.708 --> 00:06:02.518
that are often intended
for research use or industrial use.

00:06:02.542 --> 00:06:04.809
Another is that we need
to strap everything down

00:06:04.833 --> 00:06:08.643
because current eye-tracking algorithms
don't have the robustness that we need.

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:09.976
So moving forward,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.476
as we move from a research
setting into a start-up,

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.434
we plan to make future autofocals

00:06:14.458 --> 00:06:17.018
eventually look a little bit more
like normal glasses.

00:06:17.042 --> 00:06:20.393
For this to happen,
we'll need to significantly improve

00:06:20.417 --> 00:06:22.559
the robustness
of our eye-tracking solution.

00:06:22.583 --> 00:06:26.768
We'll also need to incorporate smaller
and more efficient electronics and lenses.

00:06:26.792 --> 00:06:28.976
That said, even with
our current prototype,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.726
we've shown that today's
focus-tunable lens technology

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.309
is capable of outperforming
traditional forms of static correction.

00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:36.976
So it's only a matter of time.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.059
It's pretty clear that in the near future,

00:06:39.083 --> 00:06:42.143
instead of worrying about which pair
of glasses to use and when,

00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:44.708
we'll be able to just focus
on the important things.

00:06:45.667 --> 00:06:46.934
Thank you.

00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:48.583
(Applause)
