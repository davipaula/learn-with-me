00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:09.797
Symmetry is everywhere in nature,

00:00:09.797 --> 00:00:12.184
and we usually associate it with beauty:

00:00:12.184 --> 00:00:13.831
a perfectly shaped leaf,

00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:17.571
or a butterfly with intricate patterns
mirrored on each wing.

00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:21.197
But it turns out that asymmetry
is pretty important, too,

00:00:21.197 --> 00:00:23.130
and more common than you might think,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.707
from crabs with one giant pincer claw

00:00:25.707 --> 00:00:30.629
to snail species whose shells'
always coil in the same direction.

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:34.944
Some species of beans only climb up
their trellises clockwise,

00:00:34.944 --> 00:00:37.200
others, only counterclockwise,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.062
and even though the human body
looks pretty symmetrical on the outside,

00:00:41.062 --> 00:00:43.735
it's a different story on the inside.

00:00:43.735 --> 00:00:47.404
Most of your vital organs 
are arranged asymmetrically.

00:00:47.404 --> 00:00:51.939
The heart, stomach, spleen, and pancreas
lie towards the left.

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:55.676
The gallbladder and most of your liver
are on the right.

00:00:55.676 --> 00:00:57.568
Even your lungs are different.

00:00:57.568 --> 00:01:00.534
The left one has two lobes,
and the right one has three.

00:01:00.534 --> 00:01:05.301
The two sides of your brain look similar,
but function differently.

00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:10.159
Making sure this asymmetry is distributed
the right way is critical.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.152
If all your internal organs are flipped,
a condition called situs inversus,

00:01:15.152 --> 00:01:16.692
it's often harmless.

00:01:16.692 --> 00:01:19.038
But incomplete reversals can be fatal,

00:01:19.038 --> 00:01:22.099
especially if the heart is involved.

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:24.030
But where does this asymmetry come from,

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.564
since a brand-new embryo looks identical
on the right and left.

00:01:28.564 --> 00:01:31.751
One theory focuses 
on a small pit on the embryo

00:01:31.751 --> 00:01:33.045
called a node.

00:01:33.045 --> 00:01:36.000
The node is lined with tiny hairs
called cilia,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.189
while tilt away from the head
and whirl around rapidly,

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.437
all in the same direction.

00:01:42.437 --> 00:01:46.751
This synchronized rotation pushes fluid
from the right side of the embryo

00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:48.301
to the left.

00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:50.201
On the node's left-hand rim,

00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:52.610
other cilia sense this fluid flow

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.958
and activate specific genes
on the embryo's left side.

00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.724
These genes direct the cells
to make certain proteins,

00:02:00.724 --> 00:02:02.079
and in just a few hours,

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.337
the right and left sides of the embryo
are chemically different.

00:02:06.337 --> 00:02:08.126
Even though they still look the same,

00:02:08.126 --> 00:02:14.053
these chemical differences are eventually
translated into asymmetric organs.

00:02:14.053 --> 00:02:17.812
Asymmetry shows up in the heart first.

00:02:17.812 --> 00:02:21.645
It begins as a straight tube
along the center of the embryo,

00:02:21.645 --> 00:02:24.215
but when the embryo 
is around three weeks old,

00:02:24.215 --> 00:02:27.180
the tube starts to bend into a c-shape

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.115
and rotate towards 
the right side of the body.

00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:32.942
It grows different 
structures on each side,

00:02:32.942 --> 00:02:36.459
eventually turning into the familiar
asymmetric heart.

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.829
Meanwhile, the other major organs
emerge from a central tube

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.664
and grow towards their ultimate positions.

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:48.299
But some organisms, like pigs,
don't have those embryonic cilia

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.288
and still have asymmetric internal organs.

00:02:51.288 --> 00:02:54.570
Could all cells be 
intrinsically asymmetric?

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.702
Probably.

00:02:55.702 --> 00:03:00.950
Bacterial colonies grow lacy branches
that all curl in the same direction,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.423
and human cells cultured 
inside a ring-shaped boundary

00:03:04.423 --> 00:03:08.032
tend to line up 
like the ridges on a cruller.

00:03:08.032 --> 00:03:09.867
If we zoom in even more,

00:03:09.867 --> 00:03:12.562
we see that many 
of cells' basic building blocks,

00:03:12.562 --> 00:03:17.905
like nucleic acids, proteins, and sugars,
are inherently asymmetric.

00:03:17.905 --> 00:03:20.676
Proteins have complex asymmetric shapes,

00:03:20.676 --> 00:03:23.860
and those proteins control 
which way cells migrate

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.726
and which way embryonic cilia twirl.

00:03:26.726 --> 00:03:30.401
These biomolecules 
have a property called chirality,

00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:34.652
which means that a molecule 
and its mirror image aren't identical.

00:03:34.652 --> 00:03:37.652
Like your right and left hands, 
they look the same,

00:03:37.652 --> 00:03:42.342
but trying to put your right
in your left glove proves they're not.

00:03:42.342 --> 00:03:47.621
This asymmetry at the molecular level
is reflected in asymmetric cells,

00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:49.073
asymmetric embryos,

00:03:49.073 --> 00:03:51.929
and finally asymmetric organisms.

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:53.926
So while symmetry may be beautiful,

00:03:53.926 --> 00:03:57.085
asymmetry holds an allure of its own,

00:03:57.085 --> 00:03:58.728
found in its graceful whirls,

00:03:58.728 --> 00:04:00.656
its organized complexity,

00:04:00.656 --> 00:04:02.647
and its striking imperfections.
