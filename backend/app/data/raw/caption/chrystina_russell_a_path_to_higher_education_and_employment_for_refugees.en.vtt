00:00:14.753 --> 00:00:18.008
Saida Aden Said: I still have
this horrific image in my mind.

00:00:18.032 --> 00:00:20.322
I could see people falling down,

00:00:20.346 --> 00:00:21.510
gunshots.

00:00:21.534 --> 00:00:22.862
I was so terrified.

00:00:22.886 --> 00:00:25.095
Really, I was crying a lot.

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.455
Someone who knew my father and my mom
grabbed my hand, and he said,

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:30.443
"Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!"

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:33.324
And I was like, "Where's my mom?
My mom? My mom?"

00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:37.341
Noria Dambrine Dusabireme:
During nights we would hear shots,

00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:38.558
we would hear guns.

00:00:38.582 --> 00:00:40.276
Elections were supposed to happen.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.847
We had young people going in the street,

00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:44.697
they were having strikes.

00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:46.738
And most of the young people died.

00:00:47.627 --> 00:00:49.428
SAS: We boarded a vehicle.

00:00:49.452 --> 00:00:50.652
It was overloaded.

00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:53.181
People were running for their lives.

00:00:53.205 --> 00:00:55.662
That is how I fled from Somalia.

00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:57.685
My mom missed me.

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:59.780
Nobody told her where I went.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.554
NDD: The fact that
we did not go to school,

00:01:02.578 --> 00:01:05.309
we couldn't go to the market,
we were just stuck home

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:09.937
made me realize that if I got an option
to go for something better,

00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:12.855
I could just go for it
and have a better future.

00:01:13.448 --> 00:01:14.540
(Music)

00:01:14.564 --> 00:01:17.274
Ignazio Matteini: Globally,
displaced people in the world

00:01:17.298 --> 00:01:18.452
have been increasing.

00:01:18.476 --> 00:01:22.414
Now there are almost 60 million
people displaced in the world.

00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:24.791
And unfortunately, it doesn't stop.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.984
Chrystina Russell: I think
the humanitarian community

00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:30.273
is starting to realize
from research and reality

00:01:30.297 --> 00:01:32.981
that we're talking about
a much more permanent problem.

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:36.386
Baylie Damtie Yeshita: These students,
they need a tertiary education,

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.900
a degree that they can use.

00:01:38.924 --> 00:01:41.268
If the students are living now in Rwanda,

00:01:41.292 --> 00:01:44.579
if they get relocated,
still they can continue their study.

00:01:44.603 --> 00:01:48.806
Still, their degree is useful,
wherever they are.

00:01:49.778 --> 00:01:52.537
CR: Our audacious project
was to really test

00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:55.662
Southern New Hampshire University's
Global Education Movement's

00:01:55.686 --> 00:01:57.720
ability to scale,

00:01:57.744 --> 00:02:00.979
to bring bachelor's degrees
and pathways to employment

00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:05.577
to refugees and those who would otherwise
not have access to higher education.

00:02:06.402 --> 00:02:09.543
SAS: It was almost impossible,
as a refugee person,

00:02:09.567 --> 00:02:13.330
to further my education
and to make my career.

00:02:13.354 --> 00:02:15.231
My name is Saida Aden Said,

00:02:15.255 --> 00:02:17.824
and I am from Somalia.

00:02:17.848 --> 00:02:20.550
I was nine years old
when I came to Kakuma,

00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:23.635
and I started going to school at 17.

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.510
Now I am doing my bachelor degree

00:02:26.534 --> 00:02:28.360
with SNHU.

00:02:29.896 --> 00:02:33.165
NDD: My name is Noria Dambrine Dusabireme.

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:37.583
I'm doing my bachelor of arts
in communications

00:02:37.607 --> 00:02:39.971
with a concentration in business.

00:02:39.995 --> 00:02:43.694
CR: We are serving students
across five different countries:

00:02:43.718 --> 00:02:48.021
Lebanon, Kenya, Malawi,
Rwanda and South Africa.

00:02:48.045 --> 00:02:53.615
Really proud to have 800 AA grads
to over 400 bachelor's graduates

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.051
and nearly 1,000 students
enrolled right now.

00:02:59.391 --> 00:03:04.563
So, the magic of this is that we're
addressing refugee lives as they exist.

00:03:04.587 --> 00:03:06.004
There are no classes.

00:03:06.028 --> 00:03:07.735
There are no lectures.

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:09.239
There are no due dates.

00:03:09.263 --> 00:03:10.976
There are no final exams.

00:03:11.573 --> 00:03:15.503
This degree is competency-based
and not time-bound.

00:03:15.527 --> 00:03:17.928
You choose when you start your project.

00:03:17.952 --> 00:03:20.475
You choose how
you're going to approach it.

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:23.977
NDD: When you open the platform,
that's where you can see the goals.

00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:27.253
Under each goal, we can find projects.

00:03:27.277 --> 00:03:30.358
When you open a project,
you get the competencies

00:03:30.382 --> 00:03:32.235
that you have to master,

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:33.584
directions

00:03:33.608 --> 00:03:35.191
and overview of the project.

00:03:35.754 --> 00:03:37.953
CR: The secret sauce of SNHU

00:03:37.977 --> 00:03:42.197
is combining that
competency-based online learning

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:45.379
with the in-person learning
that we do with partners

00:03:45.403 --> 00:03:47.793
to provide all the wraparound supports.

00:03:47.817 --> 00:03:50.123
That includes academic coaching.

00:03:50.147 --> 00:03:51.969
It means psychosocial support,

00:03:51.993 --> 00:03:53.586
medical support,

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.630
and it's also that back-end
employment support

00:03:56.654 --> 00:04:00.138
that's really resulting
in the 95 percent graduation,

00:04:00.162 --> 00:04:02.257
the 88 percent employment.

00:04:02.281 --> 00:04:05.214
NDD: I'm a social media management intern.

00:04:05.238 --> 00:04:08.937
It's related to the communications
degree I'm doing.

00:04:08.961 --> 00:04:14.229
I've learned so many things
out of the project and in the real world.

00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:16.832
CR: The structured internship
is really an opportunity

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:19.118
for students to practice their skills,

00:04:19.142 --> 00:04:22.493
for us to create connections
between that internship

00:04:22.517 --> 00:04:25.038
and a later job opportunity.

00:04:25.703 --> 00:04:27.693
(Music)

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.091
This is a model that really
stops putting time

00:04:32.115 --> 00:04:34.791
and university policies
and procedures at the center

00:04:34.815 --> 00:04:37.354
and instead puts the student
at the center.

00:04:38.158 --> 00:04:42.730
IM: The SNHU model
is a big way to shake the tree.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:44.922
Huge.

00:04:44.946 --> 00:04:49.899
It's a huge shake to the traditional way
of having tertiary education here.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.525
BDY: It can transform
the lives of students

00:04:55.549 --> 00:04:58.545
from these vulnerable
and refugee communities.

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.006
NDD: If I get the degree,

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.541
I can just come back and work
everywhere that I want.

00:05:03.565 --> 00:05:07.060
I can go for a masters
confidently in English,

00:05:07.084 --> 00:05:10.384
which is something that
I would not have dreamt of before.

00:05:10.408 --> 00:05:13.795
And I have the confidence
and the skills required

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:17.356
to actually go out
and just tackle the workplace

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.239
without having to fear
that I can't make it.

00:05:21.263 --> 00:05:23.779
SAS: I always wanted
to work with the community.

00:05:23.803 --> 00:05:26.420
I want to establish a nonprofit.

00:05:26.444 --> 00:05:29.725
We advocate for women's education.

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:33.227
I want to be someone
who is, like, an ambassador

00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:35.968
and encourage them to learn

00:05:35.992 --> 00:05:39.086
and tell them it is never too late.

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:41.777
It's a dream.
