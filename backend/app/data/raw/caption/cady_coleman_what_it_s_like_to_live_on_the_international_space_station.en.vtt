00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.142
I'm an astronaut.

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:16.920
I flew on the space shuttle twice,

00:00:16.944 --> 00:00:21.271
and I lived on the International
Space Station for almost six months.

00:00:21.295 --> 00:00:27.032
People often ask me the same question,
which is, "What's it like in space?"

00:00:27.056 --> 00:00:28.835
as if it was a secret.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.116
Space belongs to all of us,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.865
and I'd like to help you understand why
it's a place that is magic for all of us.

00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:41.642
The day after my 50th birthday,

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:45.164
I climbed aboard a Russian capsule,

00:00:45.188 --> 00:00:46.561
in Russia,

00:00:46.585 --> 00:00:48.698
and launched into space.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.506
Launching is the most
dangerous thing that we do,

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.405
and it's also the most thrilling.

00:00:55.214 --> 00:00:58.801
Three, two, one ... liftoff!

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:03.987
I felt every single bit of the controlled
fury of those rocket engines

00:01:04.011 --> 00:01:06.774
as they blasted us off the Earth.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.172
We went faster and faster and faster,

00:01:10.196 --> 00:01:15.347
until, after eight and a half minutes,
on purpose, those engines stop --

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.204
kabunk! --

00:01:17.228 --> 00:01:19.386
and we are weightless.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.806
And the mission and the magic begin.

00:01:23.174 --> 00:01:26.516
Dmitry and Paolo and I
are circling the Earth

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.365
in our tiny spacecraft,

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:30.873
approaching the space station carefully.

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:35.647
It's an intricate dance
at 17,500 miles an hour

00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:39.427
between our capsule,
the size of a Smart Car,

00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:42.838
and the space station,
the size of a football field.

00:01:42.862 --> 00:01:49.577
We arrive when those two craft dock
with a gentle thunk.

00:01:50.405 --> 00:01:52.596
We open the hatches,

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.114
have sloppy zero-G hugs with each other,

00:01:56.138 --> 00:01:58.367
and now we're six.

00:01:58.391 --> 00:02:01.444
We're a space family, an instant family.

00:02:02.618 --> 00:02:05.911
My favorite part about living up there

00:02:05.935 --> 00:02:07.623
was the flying.

00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:09.420
I loved it.

00:02:09.444 --> 00:02:11.174
It was like being Peter Pan.

00:02:11.198 --> 00:02:12.598
It's not about floating.

00:02:12.622 --> 00:02:14.558
Just the touch of a finger

00:02:14.582 --> 00:02:18.357
can actually push you across
the entire space station,

00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:21.122
and then you sort of
tuck in with your toes.

00:02:21.146 --> 00:02:25.331
One of my favorite things
was drifting silently

00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:26.745
through the space station,

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.914
which was humming along at night.

00:02:28.938 --> 00:02:32.447
I wondered sometimes
if it knew I was there,

00:02:32.471 --> 00:02:34.035
just silent.

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:37.579
But sharing the wonder
of that with the crew

00:02:37.603 --> 00:02:40.645
was also part of what was important to me.

00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:48.277
A typical day in space
starts with the perfect commute.

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:51.424
I wake up, cruise down the lab

00:02:51.448 --> 00:02:55.463
and say hello to the best
morning view ever.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.525
It's a really fast commute,
only 30 seconds,

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.038
and we never get tired
of looking out that window.

00:03:03.062 --> 00:03:07.852
I think it reminds us that we're
actually still very close to Earth.

00:03:08.426 --> 00:03:12.104
Our crew was the second ever
to use the Canadian robotic arm

00:03:12.128 --> 00:03:15.721
to capture a supply ship
the size of a school bus

00:03:15.745 --> 00:03:18.469
containing about a dozen
different experiments

00:03:18.493 --> 00:03:22.494
and the only chocolate that we would see
for the next four months.

00:03:22.518 --> 00:03:25.552
Now, chocolate aside,
every single one of those experiments

00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:29.829
enables yet one more
scientific question answered

00:03:29.853 --> 00:03:33.086
that we can't do down here on Earth.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.468
And so, it's like a different lens,

00:03:35.492 --> 00:03:38.500
allowing us to see the answers
to questions like,

00:03:38.524 --> 00:03:39.736
"What about combustion?"

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.609
"What about fluid dynamics?"

00:03:42.633 --> 00:03:45.232
Now, sleeping is delightful.

00:03:45.256 --> 00:03:48.364
My favorite -- I mean, you could be
upside down, right side up --

00:03:48.388 --> 00:03:51.360
my favorite: curled up
in a little ball and floating freely.

00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:54.335
Laundry? Nope.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.987
We load our dirty clothes
into an empty supply ship

00:03:58.011 --> 00:04:00.276
and send it off into space.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.471
The bathroom.

00:04:01.495 --> 00:04:02.887
Everyone wants to know.

00:04:02.911 --> 00:04:05.635
It's hard to understand,
so I made a little video,

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.119
because I wanted kids to understand

00:04:08.143 --> 00:04:11.040
that the principle of vacuum saves the day

00:04:11.064 --> 00:04:14.143
and that just a gentle breeze
helps everything go

00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:16.380
where it is supposed to.

00:04:16.404 --> 00:04:18.303
Well, in real life it does.

00:04:18.327 --> 00:04:19.405
(Laughter)

00:04:19.429 --> 00:04:20.620
Recycling? Of course.

00:04:20.644 --> 00:04:25.891
So we take our urine, we store it,
we filter it and then we drink it.

00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:27.450
And it's actually delicious.

00:04:27.474 --> 00:04:28.489
(Laughter)

00:04:28.513 --> 00:04:30.635
Sitting around the table,

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:33.481
eating food that looks bad
but actually tastes pretty good.

00:04:33.505 --> 00:04:36.319
But it's the gathering around
the table that's important,

00:04:36.343 --> 00:04:39.619
I think both in space and on Earth,

00:04:39.643 --> 00:04:42.374
because that's what cements
a crew together.

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:46.733
For me, music was a way to stay connected
to the rest of the world.

00:04:46.757 --> 00:04:49.995
I played a duet between Earth and space

00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:52.965
with Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull

00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:56.080
on the 50th anniversary
of human spaceflight.

00:04:56.644 --> 00:04:59.199
Connecting to family was so important.

00:04:59.223 --> 00:05:03.533
I talked with my family almost every day
the whole time I was up there,

00:05:03.557 --> 00:05:08.608
and I would actually read books to my son
as a way for us just to be together.

00:05:08.632 --> 00:05:09.923
So important.

00:05:09.947 --> 00:05:12.593
Now, when the space station
would go over Massachusetts,

00:05:12.617 --> 00:05:14.266
my family would run outside,

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.956
and they would watch the brightest star
sailing across the sky.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.629
And when I looked down,
I couldn't see my house,

00:05:21.653 --> 00:05:25.576
but it meant a lot to me to know
that the people I loved the most

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.580
were looking up while I was looking down.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.952
So the space station, for me, is the place
where mission and magic come together.

00:05:34.976 --> 00:05:37.606
The mission, the work are vital steps

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.856
in our quest to go further than our planet

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.951
and imperative for understanding
sustainability here on Earth.

00:05:43.975 --> 00:05:45.693
I loved being a part of that,

00:05:45.717 --> 00:05:48.493
and if I could have taken
my family with me,

00:05:48.517 --> 00:05:50.279
I never would have come home.

00:05:50.853 --> 00:05:54.044
And so my view from the station showed me

00:05:54.068 --> 00:05:57.160
that we are all from the same place.

00:05:57.184 --> 00:06:00.112
We all have our roles to play.

00:06:00.136 --> 00:06:03.699
Because, the Earth is our ship.

00:06:03.723 --> 00:06:06.237
Space is our home.

00:06:07.086 --> 00:06:11.671
And we are the crew of Spaceship Earth.

00:06:12.687 --> 00:06:13.864
Thank you.

00:06:13.888 --> 00:06:15.439
(Applause)
