00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:17.221
I grew up in the late '70s in rural China

00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:21.810
during the final years of my country's
pursuit of absolute equality

00:00:21.834 --> 00:00:24.402
at the expense of liberty.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.194
At that time, everybody had a job,

00:00:27.218 --> 00:00:29.288
but everyone was struggling.

00:00:29.312 --> 00:00:32.188
In the early '80s,
my dad was an electrician,

00:00:32.212 --> 00:00:35.084
and my mom worked two shifts
in the local hospital.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.730
But still, we didn't have enough food,

00:00:38.754 --> 00:00:41.071
and our living conditions were dismal.

00:00:41.095 --> 00:00:43.086
We were undoubtedly equal --

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.649
we were equally poor.

00:00:45.114 --> 00:00:47.122
The state owned everything.

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:48.602
We owned nothing.

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.981
The story I'm going to share with you
is about my struggles

00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:55.205
of overcoming adversity

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:00.267
with my resilience, grit
and sheer determination.

00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:03.677
No, I'm just kidding,
I'm not going to do that to you.

00:01:03.701 --> 00:01:06.070
(Laughter)

00:01:06.094 --> 00:01:10.044
Instead, I'm going to tell you,

00:01:10.068 --> 00:01:14.214
what I'm going to talk about today
is about a new form of collective poverty

00:01:14.238 --> 00:01:16.167
that many of us don't recognize

00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:18.345
and that urgently needs to be understood.

00:01:18.822 --> 00:01:21.280
I'm sure you've noticed
that in the past 20 years,

00:01:21.304 --> 00:01:23.080
that asset has emerged.

00:01:23.104 --> 00:01:26.562
It's been generating wealth
at a breakneck pace.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:30.663
As a tool, it has brought businesses
deep customer insights,

00:01:30.687 --> 00:01:32.325
operational efficiency

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:34.541
and enormous top-line growth.

00:01:35.018 --> 00:01:36.646
But for some,

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.467
it has also provided a device
to manipulate a democratic election

00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:46.660
or perform surveillance
for profit or political purposes.

00:01:47.287 --> 00:01:49.333
What is this miracle asset?

00:01:49.357 --> 00:01:51.270
You've guessed it: it's data.

00:01:52.308 --> 00:01:56.874
Seven out of the top 10 most valuable
companies in the world are tech companies

00:01:56.898 --> 00:01:59.865
that either directly generate
profit from data

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:02.321
or are empowered by data from the core.

00:02:03.352 --> 00:02:04.617
Multiple surveys show

00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:07.127
that the vast majority
of business decision makers

00:02:07.151 --> 00:02:10.522
regard data as an essential
asset for success.

00:02:10.546 --> 00:02:16.484
We have all experienced how data
is shifting this major paradigm shift

00:02:16.508 --> 00:02:20.393
for our personal, economic
and political lives.

00:02:20.764 --> 00:02:23.115
Whoever owns the data owns the future.

00:02:23.553 --> 00:02:25.278
But who's producing the data?

00:02:26.004 --> 00:02:28.968
I assume everyone in this room
has a smartphone,

00:02:28.992 --> 00:02:30.484
several social media accounts

00:02:30.508 --> 00:02:33.458
and has done a Google search
or two in the past week.

00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:36.281
We are all producing data. Yes.

00:02:36.948 --> 00:02:40.356
It is estimated that by 2030,
10 years from now,

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.579
there will be about 125 billion
connected devices in the world.

00:02:44.603 --> 00:02:49.027
That's an average of about
15 devices per person.

00:02:49.511 --> 00:02:51.538
We are already producing data every day.

00:02:51.562 --> 00:02:54.720
We'll be producing exponentially more.

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:59.540
Google, Facebook and Tencent's
combined revenue in 2018

00:02:59.564 --> 00:03:02.848
was 236 billion US dollars.

00:03:02.872 --> 00:03:05.409
Now, how many of you
have received payment from them

00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:07.141
for the data you generate for them?

00:03:07.165 --> 00:03:08.546
None, right?

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.531
Data has immense value
but is centrally controlled and owned.

00:03:12.555 --> 00:03:17.418
You are all walking raw materials
for those large data companies,

00:03:17.442 --> 00:03:18.877
but none of you are paid.

00:03:19.703 --> 00:03:20.876
Not only that,

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.270
you're not even considered
as part of this equation for income.

00:03:25.651 --> 00:03:27.344
So once again,

00:03:27.368 --> 00:03:29.105
we are undoubtedly equal:

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:30.592
we're equally poor.

00:03:31.004 --> 00:03:34.043
Somebody else owns everything,
and we own nothing.

00:03:34.067 --> 00:03:35.620
Sounds familiar, doesn't it?

00:03:36.747 --> 00:03:38.134
So what should we do?

00:03:38.158 --> 00:03:40.571
There might be some clues
in how my life turned out

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:41.933
after that difficult start.

00:03:41.957 --> 00:03:44.376
Things began to look up
for my family in the '80s.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.879
The system evolved,

00:03:45.903 --> 00:03:49.635
and people began to be allowed
to own a piece of what we created.

00:03:50.118 --> 00:03:51.836
"People diving into the ocean,"

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.208
or "xia hai," the Chinese term,

00:03:54.232 --> 00:03:57.531
described those who left
state-owned enterprise jobs

00:03:57.555 --> 00:03:59.330
and started their own businesses.

00:03:59.814 --> 00:04:01.801
Private ownership of a business

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:04.905
became personal ownership of cars,

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:08.366
properties, food, clothes and things.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.261
The economic machine started rolling,

00:04:11.285 --> 00:04:13.485
and people's lives began to improve.

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:14.753
For the first time,

00:04:14.777 --> 00:04:17.385
to get rich was glorious.

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:22.472
So in the '90s, when I went
to study in Chengdu in west China,

00:04:22.496 --> 00:04:24.124
many young individuals like myself

00:04:24.148 --> 00:04:26.927
were well-positioned
to take advantage of the new system.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.034
After I graduated from my university,

00:04:30.058 --> 00:04:33.241
I cofounded my first business
and moved to Shenzhen,

00:04:33.265 --> 00:04:37.744
the brand-new special economic zone
that used to be a fishing village.

00:04:37.768 --> 00:04:38.937
Twenty years later,

00:04:38.961 --> 00:04:43.366
Shenzhen has become
a global innovation powerhouse.

00:04:44.667 --> 00:04:48.745
Private ownership was a form of liberty
we didn't have before.

00:04:49.276 --> 00:04:54.199
It created unprecedented opportunities
for our generations,

00:04:54.223 --> 00:04:57.851
motivating us to work
and study incredibly hard.

00:04:58.317 --> 00:05:04.203
The result was that more than
850 million people rose out of poverty.

00:05:04.227 --> 00:05:06.195
According to the World Bank,

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:12.580
China's extreme poverty rate in 1981,
when I was a little kid, was 88 percent.

00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:16.031
By 2015, 0.7 percent.

00:05:16.832 --> 00:05:18.576
I am a product of that success,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.692
and I am very happy to share that today,
I have my own AI business,

00:05:22.716 --> 00:05:25.414
and I lead a very worldly
and dynamic life,

00:05:25.438 --> 00:05:29.483
a path that was unimaginable
when I was a kid in west China.

00:05:30.252 --> 00:05:34.096
Of course, this prosperity
came with a trade-off,

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.510
with equality,
the environment and freedom.

00:05:38.534 --> 00:05:42.267
And obviously I'm not here to argue
that China has it all figured out.

00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:43.497
We haven't.

00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:47.707
Nor that data is fully comparable
to physical assets.

00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:48.996
It is not.

00:05:49.726 --> 00:05:54.709
But my life experience allowed me
to see what's hiding in plain sight.

00:05:54.733 --> 00:05:56.328
Currently, the public discourse

00:05:56.352 --> 00:06:00.359
is so focused on the regulatory
and privacy issue

00:06:00.383 --> 00:06:02.114
when it comes to data ownership.

00:06:02.138 --> 00:06:03.813
But I want to ask:

00:06:03.837 --> 00:06:07.053
What if we look at data ownership
in completely different ways?

00:06:07.561 --> 00:06:10.216
What if data ownership is, in fact,

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.568
a personal, individual and economic issue?

00:06:15.183 --> 00:06:17.537
What if, in the new digital economy,

00:06:17.561 --> 00:06:20.617
we are allowed to own
a piece of what we create

00:06:20.641 --> 00:06:24.781
and give people the liberty
of private data ownership?

00:06:26.111 --> 00:06:30.313
The legal concept of ownership
is when you can possess,

00:06:30.337 --> 00:06:34.648
use, gift, pass on, destroy

00:06:34.672 --> 00:06:38.585
or trade it or sell your asset

00:06:38.609 --> 00:06:40.621
at a price accepted by you.

00:06:41.446 --> 00:06:45.545
What if we give that same definition
to individuals' data,

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:49.027
so individuals can use or destroy our data

00:06:49.051 --> 00:06:51.531
or we trade it at our chosen price?

00:06:52.013 --> 00:06:53.687
Now, I know some of you might say,

00:06:53.711 --> 00:06:57.139
"I would never, ever trade my data
for any amount of money."

00:06:57.163 --> 00:07:00.448
But that, let me remind you,
is exactly what you're doing now,

00:07:00.472 --> 00:07:02.910
except you're giving
your data away for free.

00:07:03.576 --> 00:07:07.618
Plus, privacy is a very personal
and nuanced issue.

00:07:07.642 --> 00:07:12.033
You might have the privilege
to prioritize your privacy over money,

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:15.078
but for millions of small
business owners in China

00:07:15.102 --> 00:07:17.441
who can't get bank loans easily,

00:07:17.465 --> 00:07:22.228
using their data to gain rapid loan
approval from AI-powered lenders

00:07:22.252 --> 00:07:24.391
can answer their more pressing needs.

00:07:24.867 --> 00:07:26.271
What's private to you

00:07:26.295 --> 00:07:29.027
is different from
what's private to others.

00:07:29.051 --> 00:07:31.492
What's private to you now

00:07:31.516 --> 00:07:35.041
is different from what was private
when you were in college.

00:07:35.065 --> 00:07:36.463
Or, at least, I hope so.

00:07:36.487 --> 00:07:38.404
(Laughter)

00:07:38.428 --> 00:07:42.629
We are always,
although often subconsciously,

00:07:42.653 --> 00:07:43.997
making such trade-offs

00:07:44.021 --> 00:07:48.072
based on our diverse personal beliefs
and life priorities.

00:07:48.096 --> 00:07:52.017
That is why data ownership
would be incomplete

00:07:52.041 --> 00:07:53.800
without a pricing power.

00:07:54.665 --> 00:07:57.335
By assigning pricing power to individuals,

00:07:57.359 --> 00:08:01.590
we gain a tool to reflect
our personal and nuanced preferences.

00:08:01.614 --> 00:08:05.053
So, for example, you could choose
to donate your data for free

00:08:05.077 --> 00:08:08.722
if a contribution
to a particular medical research

00:08:08.746 --> 00:08:10.532
is very meaningful for you.

00:08:11.068 --> 00:08:14.006
Or, if we had the tools
to set our behavior data

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:17.313
at a price of, say,
100,000 US dollars,

00:08:17.337 --> 00:08:19.767
I doubt any political group
would be able to target

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.663
or manipulate your vote.

00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:24.490
You control. You decide.

00:08:25.403 --> 00:08:27.950
Now, I know this sounds
probably implausible,

00:08:27.974 --> 00:08:29.654
but trends are already pointing to

00:08:29.678 --> 00:08:34.459
a growing and very powerful
individual data ownership movement.

00:08:34.483 --> 00:08:36.947
First, start-ups
are already creating tools

00:08:36.971 --> 00:08:39.337
to allow us to take back some control.

00:08:39.361 --> 00:08:42.434
A new browser called Brave

00:08:42.458 --> 00:08:45.970
empowers users with "Brave Shields" --
they literally call it that --

00:08:45.994 --> 00:08:50.995
by aggressively blocking
data-grabbing ads and trackers,

00:08:51.019 --> 00:08:53.503
and avoid leaking data
like other browsers.

00:08:53.527 --> 00:08:58.470
In return, users can take back
some bargaining and pricing power.

00:08:58.494 --> 00:09:01.704
When users opt in to accept ads,

00:09:01.728 --> 00:09:05.105
Brave rewards users
with "basic attention tokens"

00:09:05.129 --> 00:09:09.350
that can redeem content
behind paywalls from publishers.

00:09:10.686 --> 00:09:12.739
And I've been using Brave
for a few months.

00:09:12.763 --> 00:09:16.715
It has already blocked
more than 200,000 ads and trackers

00:09:16.739 --> 00:09:19.366
and saved hours of my time.

00:09:19.695 --> 00:09:22.320
Now, I know some of you
interact with your browser

00:09:22.344 --> 00:09:24.560
more than with your partners, so --

00:09:24.584 --> 00:09:25.624
(Laughter)

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:30.301
you should at least find one that doesn't
waste your time and is not creepy.

00:09:30.325 --> 00:09:31.943
(Laughter)

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.700
Do you think Google is indispensable?

00:09:37.351 --> 00:09:38.607
Think again.

00:09:38.631 --> 00:09:41.650
A search engine is indispensable.

00:09:41.674 --> 00:09:43.343
Google just has the monopoly --

00:09:43.367 --> 00:09:44.520
for now.

00:09:44.544 --> 00:09:48.734
A search engine called DuckDuckGo
doesn't store your personal information

00:09:48.758 --> 00:09:50.277
or follow you around with ads

00:09:50.301 --> 00:09:52.960
or track your personal browsing history.

00:09:52.984 --> 00:09:55.796
Instead, it gives all users
the same search results

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:59.715
instead of based on
your personal browsing records.

00:10:00.565 --> 00:10:03.339
In London, a company called digi.me

00:10:03.363 --> 00:10:06.241
offers an app you can download
on your smartphone

00:10:06.265 --> 00:10:11.007
that helps to import and consolidate
your data generated by you

00:10:11.031 --> 00:10:13.212
from your Fitbit, Spotify,

00:10:13.236 --> 00:10:14.810
social media accounts ...

00:10:15.405 --> 00:10:18.415
And you can choose
where to store your data,

00:10:18.439 --> 00:10:22.782
and digi.me will help you
to make your data work for you

00:10:22.806 --> 00:10:25.967
by providing insights that used
to be exclusively accessible

00:10:25.991 --> 00:10:27.645
by large data companies.

00:10:28.584 --> 00:10:33.481
In DC, a new initiative
called UBDI, U-B-D-I,

00:10:33.505 --> 00:10:35.922
Universal Basic Data Income,

00:10:35.946 --> 00:10:37.935
helps people to make money

00:10:37.959 --> 00:10:41.978
by sharing anonymous insights
through their data

00:10:42.002 --> 00:10:44.677
for companies that can use them
for market research.

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:48.357
And whenever a company purchases a study,

00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:52.469
users get paid in cash and UBDI points
to track their contribution,

00:10:52.493 --> 00:10:55.639
potentially as much
as 1,000 US dollars per year

00:10:55.663 --> 00:10:57.928
per their estimation.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.305
UBDI could be a very feasible path
for universal basic income

00:11:03.329 --> 00:11:04.793
in the AI economy.

00:11:05.642 --> 00:11:11.379
Further, individual awareness
of privacy and data ownership

00:11:11.403 --> 00:11:12.641
is growing fast

00:11:13.424 --> 00:11:17.938
as we all become aware of this monster
we have unleashed in our pocket.

00:11:18.684 --> 00:11:21.150
I'm a mother of two preteen girls,

00:11:21.174 --> 00:11:22.769
and trust me,

00:11:22.793 --> 00:11:27.988
the single biggest source of stress
and anxiety as a parent,

00:11:28.012 --> 00:11:31.776
for me, is my children's
relationship with technology.

00:11:33.161 --> 00:11:37.000
This is a three-page agreement
my husband and I make them sign

00:11:37.024 --> 00:11:39.301
before they receive
their first [mobile phone].

00:11:39.325 --> 00:11:40.993
(Laughter)

00:11:41.619 --> 00:11:43.937
We want to help them to become

00:11:45.191 --> 00:11:47.772
digital citizens,

00:11:47.796 --> 00:11:53.489
but only if we can make them
become smart and responsible ones.

00:11:53.513 --> 00:11:57.654
I help them to understand
what kind of data should never be shared.

00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:00.500
So if you Google me,

00:12:00.524 --> 00:12:03.989
in fact -- actually, sorry --
if you DuckDuckGo me,

00:12:04.013 --> 00:12:07.293
you will find maybe a lot
about me and my work,

00:12:07.317 --> 00:12:10.022
but you may find no information
about my daughters.

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:11.865
When they grow up,

00:12:11.889 --> 00:12:15.187
if they want to put themselves out there,
it's their choice, not mine,

00:12:15.211 --> 00:12:17.786
despite that I insist
they're the most beautiful,

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:21.761
smartest and most extraordinary
kids in the world, of course.

00:12:23.474 --> 00:12:26.217
And I know many people
are having similar conversations

00:12:26.241 --> 00:12:28.014
and making similar decisions,

00:12:28.038 --> 00:12:29.331
which gives me hope

00:12:29.355 --> 00:12:32.478
that a truly smart data-rich future
will be here soon.

00:12:33.592 --> 00:12:36.976
But I want to highlight
the Clause 6 of this agreement.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.634
It says, "I will never, ever search
for any information online

00:12:40.658 --> 00:12:44.121
if I would be embarrassed
if seen by Grandma Dawnie."

00:12:44.145 --> 00:12:45.213
(Laughter)

00:12:45.237 --> 00:12:47.102
Try it. It's really effective.

00:12:47.126 --> 00:12:48.501
(Laughter)

00:12:49.588 --> 00:12:51.549
Throughout history,

00:12:51.573 --> 00:12:57.588
there has always been a trade-off
between liberty and equality

00:12:57.612 --> 00:13:00.198
in the pursuit of prosperity.

00:13:00.657 --> 00:13:07.023
The world has constantly been going
through the circle of wealth accumulation

00:13:07.047 --> 00:13:08.994
to wealth redistribution.

00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:12.673
As the tension between
the haves and have-nots

00:13:12.697 --> 00:13:14.892
is breaking so many countries,

00:13:14.916 --> 00:13:17.327
it is in everyone's interest,

00:13:17.351 --> 00:13:19.851
including the large data companies,

00:13:19.875 --> 00:13:23.173
to prevent this new form of inequality.

00:13:23.997 --> 00:13:29.301
Of course, individual data ownership
is not the perfect nor the complete answer

00:13:29.325 --> 00:13:31.746
to this profoundly complex question

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.792
of what makes a good digital society.

00:13:36.991 --> 00:13:38.551
But according to McKinsey,

00:13:40.321 --> 00:13:46.383
AI will add 13 trillion US dollars
of economic output in the next 10 years.

00:13:46.883 --> 00:13:50.096
Data generated by individuals
will no doubt contribute

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.555
to this enormous growth.

00:13:53.716 --> 00:13:56.662
Shouldn't we at least consider
an economic model

00:13:56.686 --> 00:13:58.556
that empowers the people?

00:13:59.055 --> 00:14:03.754
And if private ownership helped
to lift more than 850 million people

00:14:03.778 --> 00:14:05.706
out of poverty,

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.727
it is our duty

00:14:07.751 --> 00:14:10.795
and we owe it to future generations

00:14:10.819 --> 00:14:14.335
to create a more inclusive AI economy

00:14:14.359 --> 00:14:18.782
that will empower the people
in addition to businesses.

00:14:18.806 --> 00:14:19.984
Thank you.

00:14:20.008 --> 00:14:23.152
(Applause)
