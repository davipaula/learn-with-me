00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.229
Muscles and joints shift and jostle.

00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:16.658
The heart’s pounding rhythm speeds up. 
Blood roars through arteries and veins.

00:00:16.658 --> 00:00:21.028
Over the course of a pregnancy, 
every organ in the body changes.

00:00:21.028 --> 00:00:23.514
Ignited by a range of hormones,

00:00:23.514 --> 00:00:26.937
these changes begin 
as soon as pregnancy begins.

00:00:30.384 --> 00:00:36.238
Just days after fertilization, the embryo 
implants in the lining of the uterus.

00:00:36.238 --> 00:00:39.608
Because its DNA doesn’t exactly match 
the mother’s,

00:00:39.608 --> 00:00:43.510
the immune system should theoretically 
recognize it as an invader,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.417
attack, and destroy it, like it would 
bacteria or other harmful microbes.

00:00:48.417 --> 00:00:51.577
That’s the challenge: 
the mother’s immune system

00:00:51.577 --> 00:00:57.083
needs to protect both her and the fetus, 
but can’t act as it usually does.

00:00:57.083 --> 00:01:01.053
What happens is not as simple 
as decreasing the immune response.

00:01:01.053 --> 00:01:06.144
Instead, it’s a complex interaction 
we’re just beginning to understand,

00:01:06.144 --> 00:01:08.984
involving many different types 
of immune cells—

00:01:08.984 --> 00:01:13.523
some of which seem to protect the fetus 
from attack by other immune cells.

00:01:15.977 --> 00:01:20.537
The body also creates an antibacterial 
plug made of mucus on the cervix,

00:01:20.537 --> 00:01:24.512
which keeps germs away 
and stays sealed until labor.

00:01:24.512 --> 00:01:26.096
As a pregnancy progresses,

00:01:26.096 --> 00:01:30.076
the uterus expands upward and outward 
with the growing fetus.

00:01:30.076 --> 00:01:33.806
To make room, hormones 
called progesterone and relaxin

00:01:33.806 --> 00:01:36.347
signal muscles to loosen.

00:01:36.347 --> 00:01:41.208
The muscles that propel food and waste 
through the digestive tract also loosen,

00:01:41.208 --> 00:01:42.638
which makes them sluggish,

00:01:42.638 --> 00:01:46.777
causing constipation as passage 
through the tract slows down.

00:01:46.777 --> 00:01:48.826
Loosened muscles 
at the top of the stomach

00:01:48.826 --> 00:01:52.147
might allow acid to escape 
into the esophagus and throat,

00:01:52.147 --> 00:01:54.347
causing heartburn and reflux.

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:56.607
These changes can worsen morning sickness,

00:01:56.607 --> 00:02:03.121
which is caused in part by hormone HCG— 
and can also happen at other times of day.

00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:06.091
As the uterus grows, 
it pushes on the diaphragm,

00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:10.487
the muscle that expands and contracts 
the chest with each breath.

00:02:10.487 --> 00:02:12.917
This limits the diaphragm’s range.

00:02:12.917 --> 00:02:17.592
To compensate, the hormone progesterone 
acts as a respiratory stimulant,

00:02:17.592 --> 00:02:21.317
making the pregnant woman breathe 
faster so both she and the baby

00:02:21.317 --> 00:02:25.122
can both get enough oxygen 
with less lung capacity.

00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:29.222
This all may leave the pregnant woman 
feeling short of breath.

00:02:29.222 --> 00:02:32.702
Meanwhile, the kidneys 
make more erythropoietin,

00:02:32.702 --> 00:02:35.812
a hormone that increases 
red blood cell production.

00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:43.690
The kidneys also keep extra water and salt
rather than filtering it out into urine

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.420
to build up the volume of the blood.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.892
A pregnant woman’s blood volume 
increases by 50% or more.

00:02:50.892 --> 00:02:52.399
But it’s also a bit diluted,

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:56.384
because it only has 25% 
more red blood cells.

00:02:56.384 --> 00:03:00.214
Usually, the body makes blood cells 
using iron from our food.

00:03:00.214 --> 00:03:04.154
But during pregnancy, the fetus 
is also building its own blood supply

00:03:04.154 --> 00:03:06.014
from nutrients in the mother’s food—

00:03:06.014 --> 00:03:09.284
leaving less iron and other nutrients 
for the mother.

00:03:09.284 --> 00:03:12.304
The heart has to work extra hard 
to pump all this blood

00:03:12.304 --> 00:03:14.444
through the body and placenta.

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:16.834
A pregnant woman’s heart rate increases,

00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:21.334
but we don’t fully understand how blood 
pressure changes in a healthy pregnancy—

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:23.401
an important area of research,

00:03:23.401 --> 00:03:25.904
because some of the most serious 
complications

00:03:25.904 --> 00:03:29.274
are related to the heart 
and blood pressure.

00:03:29.274 --> 00:03:31.921
The expanding uterus may press on veins—

00:03:31.921 --> 00:03:35.191
causing fluid buildup 
in the legs and feet.

00:03:35.191 --> 00:03:38.851
If it presses on a large vein 
called the inferior vena cava,

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:41.949
it might interfere with blood 
returning to the heart,

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:46.608
causing a dizzying drop in blood pressure 
after standing for too long.

00:03:46.608 --> 00:03:51.220
Some of these changes start 
to reverse even before birth.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.670
Shortly before delivery, 
the fetus drops down,

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.941
decreasing the pressure on the diaphragm

00:03:56.941 --> 00:04:00.911
and allowing the pregnant woman 
to take deeper breaths.

00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:02.491
During labor and birth,

00:04:02.491 --> 00:04:05.721
much of the extra fluid in the body 
is lost when the water breaks.

00:04:08.612 --> 00:04:13.232
The uterus shrinks back down 
in the weeks after birth.

00:04:13.232 --> 00:04:16.545
Like the rest of the body, 
pregnancy affects the brain—

00:04:16.545 --> 00:04:20.246
but its effects here are some 
of the least understood.

00:04:20.246 --> 00:04:23.096
Recent studies show differences 
in brain scans

00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:25.606
after pregnancy and early parenting,

00:04:25.606 --> 00:04:28.706
and suggest that these changes 
are adaptive.

00:04:28.706 --> 00:04:31.736
That means they could help 
with parenting skills,

00:04:31.736 --> 00:04:37.505
such as an increased ability to read 
facial cues since babies can’t talk.

00:04:37.505 --> 00:04:41.085
The lack of information about pregnancy’s 
effects on the brain

00:04:41.085 --> 00:04:47.174
highlights a general truth: historically, 
almost all the research around pregnancy

00:04:47.174 --> 00:04:51.044
has focused on the fetus, 
rather than pregnant women.

00:04:51.044 --> 00:04:53.775
Experiences of pregnancy vary widely,

00:04:53.775 --> 00:04:56.245
both within the range 
of healthy pregnancies

00:04:56.245 --> 00:05:01.711
and due to complicating health conditions—
new research will help us understand why,

00:05:01.711 --> 00:05:05.271
and develop effective treatments 
where necessary.

00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:08.545
In the meantime, 
every pregnancy is different,

00:05:08.545 --> 00:05:12.269
and it’s important to consult a doctor 
with any specific questions.

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:16.779
Today, we’re turning an exciting corner,

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:21.723
as more research is devoted 
to the astounding biology of pregnancy.
