00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:23.352
Ideas worth spreading.

00:00:23.552 --> 00:00:26.643
When is an idea worth spreading?

00:00:26.643 --> 00:00:30.098
Is an idea good by itself?

00:00:31.528 --> 00:00:35.468
Can inappropriate context ruin an idea?

00:00:37.288 --> 00:00:38.676
Can a simple idea work

00:00:38.676 --> 00:00:42.994
within a very motivating context?

00:00:44.774 --> 00:00:45.953
Here I have a piano.

00:00:47.773 --> 00:00:49.492
And within music there are ideas.

00:00:49.492 --> 00:00:51.198
For example, if I play this,

00:00:51.198 --> 00:00:57.479
(Music)

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:00.645
I can see ladies in the audience sighing

00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:02.371
because it is a wonderful idea.

00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:05.078
Who doesn't know Beethoven's 'Fur Elise'?

00:01:05.078 --> 00:01:07.401
Now, this idea needs a context.

00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:11.016
On the piano, the context
is played by the left hand.

00:01:11.016 --> 00:01:12.831
The left hand plays this.

00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:18.027
(Music)

00:01:18.027 --> 00:01:20.735
Perfect. I have an idea
and a context.

00:01:20.735 --> 00:01:23.257
Then, I just have to put them together,

00:01:23.257 --> 00:01:24.654
So it sounds like this.

00:01:24.654 --> 00:01:32.754
(Music)

00:01:32.754 --> 00:01:33.886
Something is wrong.

00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:35.917
You may notice that this

00:01:35.917 --> 00:01:36.578
(Music)

00:01:36.578 --> 00:01:38.144
can't be Beethoven.

00:01:38.984 --> 00:01:41.218
It is wrong because the melody, the idea,

00:01:41.728 --> 00:01:43.001
(Music)

00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:46.163
is in one tone
but the context is in another.

00:01:46.163 --> 00:01:47.037
(Music)

00:01:47.037 --> 00:01:49.705
This happens often in real life too.
You feel like you have an idea

00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:52.342
but the context is in
a different tone.

00:01:52.342 --> 00:01:54.001
If I take the context and do this.

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:55.614
(Music)

00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:56.705
I change it

00:01:56.705 --> 00:01:57.994
(Music)

00:01:58.454 --> 00:02:02.006
and I put it in the same frequency
and tone as the idea.

00:02:02.976 --> 00:02:07.033
(Music)

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:11.298
Then, everything starts to work.

00:02:11.298 --> 00:02:13.740
But this example is easy,

00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:17.406
if the idea is as wonderful
as Beethoven's idea.

00:02:17.756 --> 00:02:21.106
But imagine that a boy says to me

00:02:21.986 --> 00:02:23.445
"Hi Fefe" --

00:02:23.445 --> 00:02:25.266
they call me Fefe, I don't know why.

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:30.879
"Hi Fefe. I want to be a composer
and I have composed my first piece,

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.171
this is the idea I have.

00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:40.149
(Music)

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:43.006
And I say, "Yes, yes, very nice."

00:02:43.006 --> 00:02:47.611
It reminds me of the story of the father
that makes his son study violin

00:02:48.015 --> 00:02:49.626
and takes him to a friend and says:

00:02:49.626 --> 00:02:52.081
"Look, Juan, listen how my son
plays the violin."

00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:54.685
The son plays the violin...
very badly. (Laughter)

00:02:55.105 --> 00:02:57.606
And he says: "what do you think
about the execution?"

00:02:57.686 --> 00:03:01.497
"Well, executing him is excessive,
a couple of slaps would be enough."

00:03:01.497 --> 00:03:04.096
(Laughter)

00:03:04.096 --> 00:03:05.995
But, that wasn't the case.

00:03:05.995 --> 00:03:09.603
(Applause)

00:03:09.603 --> 00:03:12.624
Without going that far
it occurred to me to say

00:03:12.624 --> 00:03:15.001
"If this is your idea... (Music)

00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:17.058
you'd better do something else, son".

00:03:17.058 --> 00:03:19.665
But, if that child was Frédéric Chopin,

00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:21.689
a Polish composer
of the nineteenth century,

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:22.821
he could have written

00:03:22.821 --> 00:03:33.597
(Music)

00:03:33.597 --> 00:03:36.432
And with this very simple idea,
which could deserve a slap,

00:03:36.432 --> 00:03:37.638
he composed a prelude,

00:03:37.638 --> 00:03:38.923
"Prelude in E Minor"

00:03:38.923 --> 00:03:42.589
a wonderful piece that is played
in piano recitals everywhere.

00:03:43.855 --> 00:03:45.365
So we had these two examples.

00:03:45.365 --> 00:03:48.149
But, what happens if I say
I have an idea,

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:50.873
I'm going to be a composer,
and this is my idea.

00:03:51.733 --> 00:03:52.321
(Note)

00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:56.312
Ha! (Laughter)
What do you think?

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.047
I hear laughs. But be careful,
because laughter can be disrespectful

00:04:01.047 --> 00:04:02.814
because this note, (Note)

00:04:02.814 --> 00:04:04.774
this idea, can be repeated.

00:04:04.774 --> 00:04:05.897
(Two notes)

00:04:05.897 --> 00:04:08.254
Ha! It starts to sound different.

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.431
I can even change the rhythm --

00:04:10.431 --> 00:04:12.321
rhythm is the duration of a note.

00:04:12.321 --> 00:04:15.609
I can do this. (Notes)

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.541
If I am Tom Jobim, for example,

00:04:17.541 --> 00:04:19.611
a Brazilian composer, I can do this.

00:04:19.611 --> 00:04:29.850
(Music)

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.624
This is "One-note Samba."

00:04:31.624 --> 00:04:34.201
you may have noticed
why it's called that.

00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:35.665
(Laughter)

00:04:35.665 --> 00:04:38.318
Now, this one-note samba

00:04:38.488 --> 00:04:42.769
makes the most of
the idea of one idea

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:44.522
- the redundancy is intended -

00:04:44.522 --> 00:04:48.323
reduced to the expression
of a single note.

00:04:48.446 --> 00:04:50.982
But, speaking of reducing ideas,

00:04:50.982 --> 00:04:54.534
there is one example
which is pretty average.

00:04:54.534 --> 00:04:58.883
The most interesting example
of synthesizing an idea

00:04:58.883 --> 00:05:00.809
was invented by John Cage,

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:03.215
who composed a piece for piano

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.230
called "4 Minutes 33 Seconds."

00:05:08.674 --> 00:05:11.011
And in this case,
to be faithful to the piece,

00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:15.497
I'm going to use a score
if you don't mind.

00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:20.104
And I'm going to play just a fragment,

00:05:20.104 --> 00:05:23.429
because, you know, time is...

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.486
(Laughter)

00:05:44.505 --> 00:05:48.915
We could keep going,
but I think you get the picture.

00:05:48.915 --> 00:05:53.154
(Applause)

00:05:53.958 --> 00:05:56.782
There must be, perhaps,
a more intense version somewhere,

00:05:56.782 --> 00:05:59.514
but it's less interesting
for an orchestra.

00:05:59.514 --> 00:06:01.485
You can listen to it if you want.
(Laughter)

00:06:01.485 --> 00:06:03.328
And, speaking of ideas in music,

00:06:03.328 --> 00:06:07.361
I'm thinking, to what extent
is an idea our own?

00:06:07.361 --> 00:06:10.142
Really our own.

00:06:10.746 --> 00:06:14.037
And when does an idea
begin to be shared?

00:06:14.037 --> 00:06:16.718
There is an aria by Mozart
from the Don Giovanni opera

00:06:16.718 --> 00:06:17.707
--Don Juan--

00:06:17.707 --> 00:06:22.971
it's the story of a man
who is a womanizer and even though

00:06:24.494 --> 00:06:28.103
he seduces one woman after another,
he is never satisfied.

00:06:28.103 --> 00:06:30.544
This aria is "Là ci darem la mano"

00:06:30.544 --> 00:06:33.683
where Don Giovanni sings
to one of his lovers

00:06:33.683 --> 00:06:36.799
"come I'll give you my hand,
we will go far away,

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:38.906
you will accept this, etc."

00:06:38.906 --> 00:06:40.547
It sounds like this.

00:06:40.547 --> 00:06:41.563
(Music)

00:06:41.563 --> 00:06:44.952
Là ci darem la mano,

00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:49.055
Là mi dirai di sì:

00:06:49.896 --> 00:06:52.940
Vedi, non è lontano...

00:06:53.022 --> 00:06:58.001
'El Reino del Reves' (Spanish
nursery rhyme) (Laughter)

00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:02.968
It's very similar to that
nursery rhyme! (Applause)

00:07:02.968 --> 00:07:06.432
Now, this example is less clear
because we can think

00:07:06.433 --> 00:07:09.619
has this idea been done before?
Is it new?

00:07:09.764 --> 00:07:13.373
A composer, we could say,

00:07:13.646 --> 00:07:18.275
found things before they were lost.

00:07:18.275 --> 00:07:20.473
This is a euphemism for stealing.

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:21.861
This composer,

00:07:21.861 --> 00:07:22.582
(Laughter)

00:07:22.582 --> 00:07:24.943
let's say he is a popular composer,

00:07:24.943 --> 00:07:28.075
ran out of inspiration.

00:07:28.075 --> 00:07:30.435
He didn't show inspiration
in other work either,

00:07:30.435 --> 00:07:31.678
but in this case

00:07:31.678 --> 00:07:35.099
he wanted inspiration,
so he searched his old jukebox

00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:37.160
and his old vinyl discs.

00:07:37.344 --> 00:07:38.646
To the youngest among you,

00:07:38.646 --> 00:07:43.027
back then, we didn't have pendrives
or CDs. We had vinyl discs, you know.

00:07:43.027 --> 00:07:47.799
And he played this vinyl disc in search
for inspiration; it was a tango.

00:07:47.799 --> 00:07:50.799
(Music)

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.950
It was broken. It didn't work.
So he threw it away

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:01.412
and looked for another
and he read on the cover

00:08:01.719 --> 00:08:03.452
"Muzio Clementi",

00:08:03.452 --> 00:08:06.481
"Sonatina en sol mayor".

00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:10.374
Who knows Muzio Clementi?

00:08:10.374 --> 00:08:12.605
Well, Muzio Clementi
was a great composer.

00:08:12.605 --> 00:08:16.478
He was much less famous
than his genius deserved.

00:08:16.478 --> 00:08:18.642
He was Beethoven's teacher,
among others.

00:08:18.642 --> 00:08:22.212
And in the third movement of that sonata

00:08:22.212 --> 00:08:24.968
- the one that the composer
was using for inspiration -

00:08:24.968 --> 00:08:25.879
he wrote this.

00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:33.514
(Music)

00:08:33.514 --> 00:08:35.405
But the composer thought:

00:08:35.405 --> 00:08:37.371
"I don't like this.
Something is wrong."

00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:38.881
"And, what is this button for?"

00:08:38.881 --> 00:08:40.457
There was a button,
metronome, that had

00:08:40.457 --> 00:08:44.618
three numbers: 33, 45 and 78.

00:08:44.618 --> 00:08:45.633
(Laughter)

00:08:45.826 --> 00:08:47.678
It was set in 78.

00:08:47.678 --> 00:08:50.422
So he thought: "This is wrong.
Let me put it in 45."

00:08:50.422 --> 00:08:55.136
(Music)

00:08:55.136 --> 00:08:56.994
"No. I don't like this either."

00:08:56.994 --> 00:09:00.103
"Let's see what happens in 33."

00:09:00.103 --> 00:09:04.007
(Music)

00:09:04.007 --> 00:09:06.210
I have a hit!

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:11.022
(Music)

00:09:11.022 --> 00:09:13.778
And who, who's going to complain?

00:09:13.778 --> 00:09:19.006
(Applause)

00:09:19.006 --> 00:09:23.346
Muzio Clementi died
more than 300 years ago.

00:09:23.346 --> 00:09:25.731
Who is going to remember?
Who knows?

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:28.539
Only the idiots
who go and listen to TED talks

00:09:28.539 --> 00:09:29.992
and investigate those things.

00:09:29.992 --> 00:09:31.016
(Laughter)

00:09:31.016 --> 00:09:33.023
Now, in an unprecedented effort

00:09:33.023 --> 00:09:35.249
because the sonatina doesn't end there.

00:09:35.249 --> 00:09:36.304
(Music)

00:09:36.304 --> 00:09:37.547
It goes on...

00:09:37.547 --> 00:09:41.000
(Music)

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.001
This is the next hit.

00:09:43.001 --> 00:09:43.937
It says:

00:09:43.937 --> 00:09:49.241
"When I'm feeling happy,
when I'm feeling honey.

00:09:49.241 --> 00:09:53.645
All I have to do
is steal another tune".

00:09:53.645 --> 00:09:54.700
(Laughter)

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.475
Done! Now I just have to publish it.

00:09:56.475 --> 00:09:58.797
And we all get rich.

00:09:58.797 --> 00:10:01.289
Now, I once heard --

00:10:01.996 --> 00:10:04.248
whilst we're on the topic of ideas --

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.102
I heard Alejandro Dolina say

00:10:07.769 --> 00:10:11.630
that the genius was not the guy
who invented the first phone.

00:10:12.409 --> 00:10:15.044
The genius was the one
who invented the second phone.

00:10:15.044 --> 00:10:18.321
Because one phone alone
is not worth it.

00:10:18.321 --> 00:10:20.118
(Laughter)

00:10:20.118 --> 00:10:23.208
In the case of ideas it's the same.

00:10:23.208 --> 00:10:25.805
Some composers have great ideas.

00:10:25.805 --> 00:10:28.995
But the really brilliant composers

00:10:28.995 --> 00:10:32.919
are those who find
the second phone for each idea.

00:10:32.919 --> 00:10:36.411
And that is why one of my favorite
and most popular

00:10:36.411 --> 00:10:38.009
composers is undoubtedly Mozart.

00:10:38.009 --> 00:10:39.933
We were listening to him before

00:10:39.933 --> 00:10:42.574
- I mean, I quoted him before -

00:10:42.574 --> 00:10:44.366
in "Là ci darem la mano."

00:10:44.366 --> 00:10:46.478
He composed a Sonata in C Major

00:10:46.478 --> 00:10:52.447
a piano sonata that
could be used to tell a story.

00:10:52.447 --> 00:10:56.172
And the idea sounds like this:

00:10:56.172 --> 00:10:57.775
it begins when we are born

00:10:57.775 --> 00:11:00.164
(Music)

00:11:00.164 --> 00:11:02.105
and then we go to kindergarten.

00:11:02.105 --> 00:11:04.806
(Music)

00:11:04.806 --> 00:11:07.129
We play

00:11:07.141 --> 00:11:09.016
with other children

00:11:09.446 --> 00:11:11.471
with our friends.

00:11:14.898 --> 00:11:16.200
Then we grow older,

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.541
we finish school

00:11:18.541 --> 00:11:19.841
- elementary school -

00:11:20.578 --> 00:11:23.786
and then, all of a sudden
there she is.

00:11:24.719 --> 00:11:26.858
Ahh!

00:11:27.402 --> 00:11:29.240
When I first met my wife, I asked her

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.748
- I just met her and,
playing the piano, I asked -

00:11:31.963 --> 00:11:33.135
"Do you like music?"

00:11:33.135 --> 00:11:35.471
She said: "Yes, but never mind,
keep playing."

00:11:35.471 --> 00:11:36.833
(Laughter)

00:11:37.145 --> 00:11:38.485
She appears...

00:11:38.485 --> 00:11:44.385
(Music)

00:11:44.385 --> 00:11:47.499
All is well.
"Would you like to go out?" "Yes!"

00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:52.061
"To have a cup of coffee...
have a great time together."

00:11:52.737 --> 00:11:56.222
There we are, very happy. And this
is the time when you have to ask:

00:11:57.493 --> 00:11:59.666
"Do you like me being a musician?"

00:11:59.779 --> 00:12:00.939
"Yes!"

00:12:01.047 --> 00:12:03.878
"Do you like me being a bohemian,
not interested in things?"

00:12:03.878 --> 00:12:04.585
"Love it"

00:12:04.585 --> 00:12:05.789
"Sign it!"

00:12:05.789 --> 00:12:07.048
(Laughter)

00:12:07.048 --> 00:12:09.247
Because I want to have that
on the record,

00:12:09.247 --> 00:12:10.114
because that...

00:12:10.114 --> 00:12:12.936
(Music)

00:12:12.936 --> 00:12:15.028
is about to end.

00:12:15.028 --> 00:12:18.462
"How nice. How about living together?

00:12:19.066 --> 00:12:22.350
How about getting married?" "OK!"

00:12:24.494 --> 00:12:26.149
"Let's fix a date."

00:12:26.149 --> 00:12:29.742
(Music)

00:12:30.163 --> 00:12:32.030
And then the marriage begins...

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:34.079
Oh!
(Laughter)

00:12:35.196 --> 00:12:37.268
This is Mozart, eh?

00:12:37.268 --> 00:12:38.057
It's Mozart.

00:12:38.057 --> 00:12:39.894
(Applause)

00:12:39.894 --> 00:12:41.067
This is Mozart.

00:12:41.077 --> 00:12:42.563
(Music)

00:12:42.563 --> 00:12:43.977
The kids.

00:12:43.977 --> 00:12:46.052
Work.

00:12:47.857 --> 00:12:49.404
The house.

00:12:49.404 --> 00:12:52.697
(Music)

00:12:52.697 --> 00:12:56.339
And then...
Is this the life I want?

00:12:56.339 --> 00:12:58.868
(Music)

00:12:58.868 --> 00:13:02.201
All you want is to go back
to the beginning

00:13:03.119 --> 00:13:04.879
when you were a child

00:13:04.879 --> 00:13:07.495
(Music)

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:09.145
Ah! There we are --

00:13:09.988 --> 00:13:12.729
This is like the beginning.
But the beginning was like this.

00:13:12.729 --> 00:13:13.524
(Music)

00:13:13.524 --> 00:13:15.146
And now it's like this.

00:13:15.146 --> 00:13:16.493
(Music)

00:13:16.493 --> 00:13:18.677
It's not the same... it's alike
but it's not the same.

00:13:18.677 --> 00:13:21.632
Now we have gained a few kilos,

00:13:22.812 --> 00:13:23.812
lost some hair...

00:13:24.897 --> 00:13:27.001
The other day I was sitting
and my son said to me:

00:13:27.001 --> 00:13:29.009
"Dad, you are getting bald."

00:13:29.009 --> 00:13:31.587
(Laughter)

00:13:31.587 --> 00:13:35.195
And I said: "It's true." because now
we're going through the same thing.

00:13:35.195 --> 00:13:39.058
(Music)

00:13:39.058 --> 00:13:42.470
But we still enjoy it, right?

00:13:43.014 --> 00:13:45.861
And you are looking forward
- the kids are grown up -

00:13:45.861 --> 00:13:50.318
to meeting that person
that you once knew...

00:13:50.318 --> 00:13:56.024
(Music)

00:13:56.024 --> 00:13:59.461
and you feel that you have found her.

00:14:02.015 --> 00:14:03.242
Ah!

00:14:03.518 --> 00:14:04.944
But, how was she before?

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.846
(Music)

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:07.951
And now she is...

00:14:07.951 --> 00:14:10.801
(Music)

00:14:10.801 --> 00:14:12.246
That's okay, it's close enough.

00:14:12.246 --> 00:14:13.821
(Laughter)

00:14:13.821 --> 00:14:15.295
What can you do?

00:14:15.295 --> 00:14:17.196
I've gained some weight too...

00:14:17.196 --> 00:14:19.598
(Laughter)

00:14:19.598 --> 00:14:23.473
"Will we play? Will we go out?
"No, let's stay here."

00:14:23.473 --> 00:14:25.336
(Laughter)

00:14:25.336 --> 00:14:27.235
"Dr. House isn't that bad"

00:14:27.235 --> 00:14:30.091
(Laughter)

00:14:31.054 --> 00:14:34.010
"And Utilísima is so useful,

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.577
it has recipes and everything!

00:14:35.577 --> 00:14:36.991
(Laughter)

00:14:36.991 --> 00:14:40.149
"I like that roast beef with potatoes."

00:14:43.278 --> 00:14:44.697
And I will end there.

00:14:44.697 --> 00:14:56.990
(Applause)

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:01.708
And now that we're talking about
ideas in music that go together,

00:15:02.087 --> 00:15:05.637
and since we all trust each other
and won't tell anyone else

00:15:06.507 --> 00:15:08.456
I propose that together,

00:15:08.456 --> 00:15:10.062
we write a hit.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:14.412
Let's write a song that could sell

00:15:14.412 --> 00:15:18.441
and then we'll distribute the profits.
Nobody will know.

00:15:18.441 --> 00:15:22.308
But, to make a hit we need an idea.

00:15:22.564 --> 00:15:24.874
An idea could have three notes.

00:15:24.874 --> 00:15:26.820
There are 7 musical notes, right?

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:28.221
C, D, E, F, G, A, B.

00:15:29.236 --> 00:15:32.400
There are some alterations: flat,
sharp... But that doesn't matter.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:36.606
Together, let's create an idea
with three notes.

00:15:36.606 --> 00:15:38.812
Now, over here, give me a note.

00:15:38.812 --> 00:15:40.190
C, D, E, F, G, A, B?
A note?

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:41.189
F.

00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:42.503
F, perfect, F.

00:15:42.503 --> 00:15:43.336
F.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.707
F, what a good idea!

00:15:48.353 --> 00:15:52.530
People will say, F!
Come on! F!

00:15:53.371 --> 00:15:54.207
F.

00:15:54.207 --> 00:15:56.802
And you over there?
Give me a note.

00:15:58.022 --> 00:15:59.887
OK. OK. Let's say B.

00:15:59.887 --> 00:16:01.773
Flat? Sharp?

00:16:01.773 --> 00:16:02.856
Just B?

00:16:02.856 --> 00:16:05.224
Flat. B flat.

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:09.578
It's getting there, eh? Getting there.

00:16:09.578 --> 00:16:11.251
Let's see over there, another note?

00:16:11.251 --> 00:16:12.416
D.

00:16:12.416 --> 00:16:14.068
Flat? Sharp?

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.278
D flat.

00:16:19.253 --> 00:16:22.059
Now. We already have the idea!

00:16:22.059 --> 00:16:24.988
And in order to make it a hit,
- because that's all we want -

00:16:24.988 --> 00:16:27.389
to be able to sell it very well,

00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:30.770
and make a lot of money, we have
to make something popular.

00:16:32.122 --> 00:16:34.171
A "bolero" for example,
what do you think?

00:16:34.171 --> 00:16:48.285
(Music)

00:16:48.285 --> 00:16:51.965
Ah! But - sorry, I have to make
the cameramen move a bit -

00:16:51.965 --> 00:16:53.695
You know what?

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.879
If this is a bolero, we need lyrics.

00:16:57.002 --> 00:17:00.159
Boleros have words.

00:17:00.159 --> 00:17:03.012
This idea needs words.

00:17:03.012 --> 00:17:07.055
What word can we use? Let's see.

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:10.365
You know what?
I'm going to tell you

00:17:10.365 --> 00:17:13.141
something that I learned
after many years of studying.

00:17:13.141 --> 00:17:17.557
If the idea has three notes
the text needs three syllables.

00:17:17.557 --> 00:17:20.079
If you tell me "TEDxRíodelaPlata"

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:22.944
there is no way I could do it.
Let's see, Max?

00:17:22.944 --> 00:17:24.895
Could you give me a word?

00:17:25.038 --> 00:17:25.943
What?

00:17:25.943 --> 00:17:27.309
Give me a word for a bolero?

00:17:27.309 --> 00:17:28.797
We are creating a hit here.

00:17:28.797 --> 00:17:29.786
"So you were..."

00:17:29.786 --> 00:17:30.939
I was playing the piano

00:17:30.939 --> 00:17:33.053
Give me something to make a hit.

00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:34.325
Three notes, one word.

00:17:34.325 --> 00:17:35.581
This is a bolero.

00:17:35.581 --> 00:17:37.482
"Ambition"

00:17:38.036 --> 00:17:40.065
That's it: Ambition!

00:17:40.065 --> 00:17:43.541
Ambition to love you, to have you
ambition for whatever you want!

00:17:43.541 --> 00:17:46.157
So, let's do something.
You remember the idea, right?

00:17:46.157 --> 00:17:47.249
(Music)

00:17:47.249 --> 00:17:48.830
Let's see if we can sing this.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:52.822
Please sing "Ambition"
in these three notes.

00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:55.745
(Singing) Ambition.

00:17:55.745 --> 00:17:57.653
(Laughter)

00:17:57.653 --> 00:17:59.613
We have a problem here.
Let's see.

00:17:59.613 --> 00:18:02.042
Breathe properly, let's do it again.

00:18:02.042 --> 00:18:06.045
(Singing) Ambition.

00:18:06.045 --> 00:18:07.174
Again.

00:18:07.174 --> 00:18:09.065
(Singing) Ambition.

00:18:09.065 --> 00:18:11.236
Great! I'm going to fill in the gaps

00:18:11.236 --> 00:18:13.027
but when the theme comes back

00:18:13.027 --> 00:18:16.057
we'll sing it loudly. Ready?

00:18:16.057 --> 00:18:18.689
Let's go. We begin with Ambition

00:18:18.689 --> 00:18:22.492
(Singing) Ambition.

00:18:22.492 --> 00:18:24.093
Stop, stop, stop.

00:18:24.698 --> 00:18:26.983
Now go!

00:18:26.983 --> 00:18:28.111
Right now.

00:18:28.111 --> 00:18:31.967
(Singing) Ambition.

00:18:31.967 --> 00:18:32.979
Louder, louder.

00:18:32.979 --> 00:18:36.790
(Singing) Ambition.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:37.586
And...

00:18:37.586 --> 00:18:39.816
(Singing) Ambition.

00:18:39.816 --> 00:18:43.498
And to make it a real hit,
it needs to end with an ovation

00:18:43.498 --> 00:18:45.181
because, people will think...

00:18:45.181 --> 00:18:48.682
We're recording this live, right now,
so you can buy it at the exit,

00:18:48.682 --> 00:18:49.889
you can digitalize it.

00:18:49.889 --> 00:18:51.628
So, over here.

00:18:51.628 --> 00:18:53.839
Let's do a rehearsal of the ovation

00:18:56.839 --> 00:18:57.837
like this.

00:18:57.837 --> 00:18:59.078
(Applause)

00:18:59.078 --> 00:19:00.013
Everyone over there.

00:19:00.013 --> 00:19:01.301
(Applause)

00:19:01.301 --> 00:19:04.369
More, more, right at the back!

00:19:04.369 --> 00:19:05.595
Great! Very good!

00:19:05.595 --> 00:19:07.140
You'll do that.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.744
And you begin to sing,

00:19:08.744 --> 00:19:11.763
as the applause grows
you stop singing

00:19:11.763 --> 00:19:13.383
and start clapping.

00:19:13.383 --> 00:19:17.808
And that's how we finish
this TEDxRíodelaPlata.

00:19:17.808 --> 00:19:19.082
Let's see how it goes, eh?

00:19:19.082 --> 00:19:20.203
Everybody sing, okay?

00:19:20.203 --> 00:19:23.032
When I give the signal,
we give an ovation.

00:19:23.032 --> 00:19:25.032
We are recording this,
so, be serious.

00:19:25.032 --> 00:19:26.162
And... three...

00:19:26.408 --> 00:19:29.170
(Singing) Ambition.

00:19:31.395 --> 00:19:34.370
(Singing) Ambition.

00:19:36.032 --> 00:19:40.574
(Singing) Ambition.
(Applause)

00:19:40.574 --> 00:19:45.188
(Singing) Ambition.
(Applause)

00:19:45.188 --> 00:19:52.426
(Music)

00:19:53.091 --> 00:19:55.936
(Ovation)
