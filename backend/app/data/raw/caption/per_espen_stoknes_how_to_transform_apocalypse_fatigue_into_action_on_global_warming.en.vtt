00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.240
How do we get people engaged
in solving global warming?

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.480
I'd like to start with running
two short experiments with you all.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.776
So your task is to notice
if you feel any difference as I speak.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.000
OK?

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.320
Here we go.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.416
We are seeing rising
carbon dioxide levels,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.720
now about 410 ppms.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.816
To avoid the RCP 8.5 scenario,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.320
we need rapid decarbonization.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.296
The global carbon budget

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.816
for 66 percent likelihood
to meet the two-degree target

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.480
is approximately 800 gigatons.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.176
(Laughter)

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.440
OK, now let me try something else.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.640
We are heading for an uninhabitable earth:

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.616
monster storms,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.376
killer floods,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.696
devastating wildfires,

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.239
crazy heat waves that will cook us
under a blazing sun.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.496
2017 is already so unexpectedly warm,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.816
it's freaking out climate scientists.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.776
We have a three-year window
to cut emissions, three years.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.720
If not, we will soon live
in a boiling earth, a hellhole.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.296
OK. So --

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.816
(Applause)

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.160
Now your task:

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.536
How did these ways
of speaking make you feel?

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.656
The first, detached maybe
or just confused?

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.109
What's this guy talking about?

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.360
The other, fearful or just numb?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.456
So again, the question I asked:

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.976
How do we get people engaged
in solving global warming?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.680
And why don't these two ways
of communicating work?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.336
You see, the biggest obstacle
to dealing with climate disruptions

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.960
lies between your ears.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.336
Building on a rapidly growing body
of psychology and social science,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.336
I spent years looking
into the five inner defenses

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.120
that stop people from engaging.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.616
When people hear news about the climate
coming straight at them,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.160
the first defense comes up rapidly:

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.480
distance.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.576
When we hear about the climate,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.696
we hear about something
far away in space --

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.376
think Arctic ice, polar bears --

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.800
far away in time -- think 2100.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.880
It's huge and slow-moving --
think gigatons and centuries.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.440
So it's not here. It's not now.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.696
Since it feels so far away from me,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.400
it seems outside my circle of influence,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.416
so I feel helpless about it.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.800
There's nothing I can do.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.416
In our everyday lives,

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.296
most of us prefer to think
about nearer things,

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.536
such as our jobs, our kids,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.376
how many likes we get on Facebook.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.000
Now, that, that's real.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.000
Next defense is doom.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.016
Climate change is usually framed

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.096
as a looming disaster,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.896
bringing losses, cost and sacrifice.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.400
That makes us fearful.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.696
But after the first fear is gone,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.520
my brain soon wants
to avoid this topic altogether.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.736
After 30 years of scary
climate change communications,

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.576
more than 80 percent of media articles
still use disaster framings,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.120
but people habituate to and then --

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.816
desensitize

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.336
to doom overuse.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.880
So many of us are now suffering
a kind of apocalypse fatigue,

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.840
getting numb from too much collapse porn.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.776
The third defense is dissonance.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.696
Now, if what we know,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.136
that fossil fuel use
contributes to global warming,

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.856
conflicts with what we do --
drive, fly, eat beef --

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.200
then so-called
cognitive dissonance sets in.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.176
This is felt as an inner discomfort.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.760
We may feel like hypocrites.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.160
To get rid of this discomfort,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.136
our brain starts coming up
with justifications.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.176
So I can say, for instance,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.000
"My neighbor, he has
a much bigger car than I do."

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.296
Or, "Changing my diet
doesn't amount to anything

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.480
if I am the only one to do it."

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.376
Or, I could even want
to doubt climate science itself.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.040
I could say, "You know,
climate is always changing."

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.936
So these justifications
make us all feel better,

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.576
but at the expense

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.696
of dismissing what we know.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.080
Thus, behavior drives attitudes.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.656
My personal cognitive dissonance comes up

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.016
when I recognize that I've been
flying from Oslo to New York

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.296
and back to Oslo

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.216
in order to speak about the climate.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.976
(Laughter)

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.256
For 14 minutes.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.176
(Laughter)

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.896
So that makes me
want to move on to denial.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.176
(Laughter)

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.976
So if we keep silent,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.056
ignore or ridicule facts
about climate disruptions,

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.896
then we might find inner refuge

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.360
from fear and guilt.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.896
Denial doesn't really come
from lack of intelligence or knowledge.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.216
No, denial is a state of mind

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.096
in which I may be aware
of some troubling knowledge,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.400
but I live and act as if I don't know.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.680
So you could call it
a kind of double life,

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.776
both knowing and not knowing,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.136
and often this is reinforced by others,

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.576
my family or community,

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.720
agreeing not to raise this tricky topic.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.920
Finally, identity.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.160
Alarmed climate activists

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.976
demand that government takes action,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.696
either with regulation or carbon taxes.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.576
But consider what happens

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.336
when people who hold
conservative values, for instance,

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.160
hear from an activist that government
ought to expand even further.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.776
Particularly in rich Western democracies,

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.720
they are then less likely
to believe that science.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.656
How is that?

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.096
Well, if I hold conservative
values, for instance,

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.856
I probably prefer big proper cars
and small government

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.880
over tiny, tiny cars and huge government.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.616
And if climate science comes and then says

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.656
government should expand further,

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.440
then I probably
will trust that science less.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.400
In this way, cultural identity

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.296
starts to override the facts.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.496
The values eat the facts,

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.360
and my identity trumps truth any day.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.256
So, after recognizing
how these five D's kill engagement,

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.960
how can we move beyond them?

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.816
New research shows
how we can flip these five defenses

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.976
over into key success criteria

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.440
for a more brain-friendly
climate communication.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.976
So this is where it gets really exciting

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.840
and where we find the five S's,

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.920
the five evidence-based solutions
for what does work.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.920
First, we can flip distance to social.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.416
We can make climate feel
near, personal and urgent

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.496
by bringing it home,

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.616
and we can do that
by spreading social norms

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.776
that are positive to solutions.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.136
If I believe my friends or neighbors,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.816
you guys, will do something,

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.040
then I will, too.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.840
We can see, for instance,
this from rooftop solar panels.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.136
They are spreading from neighbor
to neighbor like a virus.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.656
It's contagious.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.160
This is the power of peer-to-peer
creating the new normal.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.200
Next, we can flip doom to supportive.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.696
Rather than backfiring frames

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.760
such as disaster and cost,

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.440
we can reframe climate
as being really about human health,

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.536
for instance, with plant-based
delicious burgers,

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.256
good for you and good for the climate.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.736
We can also reframe climate
as being about new tech opportunities,

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:41.880
about safety and about new jobs.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.616
Solar jobs, for instance,
are seeing an amazing growth.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.200
They just passed
the three million jobs mark.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.015
Psychology says,
in order to create engagement,

00:08:52.039 --> 00:08:54.616
we should present, on balance,

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.056
three positive or supportive framings

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.800
for each climate threat we mention.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.400
Then we can flip dissonance

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.496
to simpler actions.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.976
This is often called nudging.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.360
The idea is, by better
choice architecture,

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.496
we can make the climate-friendly behaviors

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.440
default and convenient.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.680
Let me illustrate this. Take food waste.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.816
Food waste at buffets goes way down

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.416
if the plate or the box size
is reduced a little,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.696
because on the smaller plate it looks full

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.416
but in the big box it looks half empty,

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.896
so we put more in.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.456
So smaller plates make
a big difference for food waste.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.176
And there are hundreds
of smart nudges like this.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.240
The point is, dissonance goes down
as more behaviors are nudged.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.456
Then we can flip denial

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.176
by tailoring signals
that visualize our progress.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.616
We can provide motivating feedback

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.960
on how well we're doing
with our problem-solving.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.296
Say you improved your transport footprint

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.840
or cut energy waste in your buildings.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.720
Then one app that can
share this well is called Ducky.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.176
The idea is, you log your actions there,

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.016
and then you can see how well
your team or company is doing,

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.880
so you get real-time signals.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.720
Finally, identity.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.320
We can flip identity with better stories.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.520
Our brain loves stories.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.386
So we need better stories
of where we all want to go,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.216
and we need more stories
of the heroes and heroines

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:37.640
of all stripes that are
making real change happen.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.296
I'm proud that my hometown of Oslo

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.656
is now embarking on a bold journey
of electrifying all transport,

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.520
whether cars, bikes or buses.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.120
One of the people
spearheading this is Christina Bu.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.496
She is heading the Electric
Vehicle Association for years

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.536
and she has been fighting every day.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.056
Now, the UK and France, India and China
have also announced plans

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.896
for ending the sales of fossil cars.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.776
Now, that's massive.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:14.776
And in Oslo, we can see
how enthusiastic EV owners

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.256
go and tell their electric stories
to friends and neighbors

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:19.576
and bring them along.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.470
So we come full circle
from story back to social.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.696
So thousands of climate communicators

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.136
are now starting to use these solutions

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.360
all over the world.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.016
It is clear, however,
that individual solutions

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.880
are not sufficient
to solving climate alone,

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:44.680
but they do build
stronger bottom-up support

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.216
for policies and solutions that can.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.070
That is why engaging people is so crucial.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.296
I started this talk

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.920
with testing two ways
of communicating climate with you.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.656
There is another way, too,

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.000
I'd like to share with you.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.536
It starts with reimagining climate itself

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.320
as the living air.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.976
Climate isn't really
about some abstract, distant climate

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.256
far, far away from us.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.800
It's about this air that surrounds us.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.776
This air, you can feel in this room, too,

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.640
the air that moves
right now in your nostrils.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.480
This air is our earth's skin.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.416
It's amazingly thin,

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.096
compared to the size of the earth
and the cosmos it shields us from,

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.616
far thinner than the skin of an apple

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.560
compared to its diameter.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.880
It may look infinite when we look up,

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:50.416
but the beautiful, breathable air
is only like five to seven miles thin,

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.120
a fragile wrapping around a massive ball.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.496
Inside this skin,

00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.680
we're all closely connected.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.336
The breath that you just took

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:08.096
contained around 400,000
of the same argon atoms

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.120
that Gandhi breathed during his lifetime.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.416
Inside this thin,
fluctuating, unsettled film,

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:20.240
all of life is nourished,
protected and held.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.376
It insulates and regulates temperatures

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.416
in a range that is just right
for water and for life as we know it,

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.480
and mediating between
the blue ocean and black eternity,

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.456
the clouds carry
all the billions of tons of water

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.680
needed for the soils.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.376
The air fills the rivers,

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.016
stirs the waters,

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.240
waters the forests.

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.016
With a global weirding of the weather,

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.400
there are good reasons
for feeling fear and despair,

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:56.456
yet we may first grieve
today's sorry state and losses

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:01.200
and then turn to face the future
with sober eyes and determination.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.560
The new psychology of climate action

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.536
lies in letting go, not of science,

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.600
but of the crutches
of abstractions and doomism,

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.760
and then choosing to tell the new stories.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.456
These are the stories

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.816
of how we achieve drawdown,
the reversing of global warming.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.880
These are the stories of the steps we take

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.896
as peoples, cities, companies

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.296
and public bodies

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.216
in caring for the air

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.040
in spite of strong headwinds.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.136
These are the stories of the steps we take

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.880
because they ground us
in what we are as humans:

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:47.360
earthlings inside this living air.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.856
Thank you.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.160
(Applause)
