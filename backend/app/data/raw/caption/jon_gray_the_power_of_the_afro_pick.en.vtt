00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:14.538
You don't really look
at a toothbrush and say,

00:00:14.562 --> 00:00:15.713
"I'm great!"

00:00:15.737 --> 00:00:18.574
But when you look at an Afro pick,
which is a grooming tool,

00:00:18.598 --> 00:00:20.849
it can remind you in your
subconscious to, like,

00:00:20.873 --> 00:00:23.683
really be proud and, like, "All right."

00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:25.240
[Small thing.]

00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:27.414
[Big idea.]

00:00:29.492 --> 00:00:32.889
An Afro pick is a utilitarian tool

00:00:32.913 --> 00:00:36.763
used to maintain the Afro hairstyle.

00:00:36.787 --> 00:00:39.254
I think the Afro pick was designed

00:00:39.278 --> 00:00:41.717
for the ergonomics of creating something

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:44.478
that felt like you were running
fingers through your hair.

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:47.808
The shape, even the depth
that it goes in -- it's like a hand.

00:00:47.832 --> 00:00:51.194
You have plastic or nylon teeth,

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:54.434
and then you have the stainless
steel or the nickel teeth.

00:00:54.458 --> 00:00:56.681
I always prefer the metal tooth

00:00:56.705 --> 00:00:58.409
just 'cause I like the sound

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:01.897
and the ones I know have
the black power fist on the handle.

00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:04.097
When I think of black hair in America,

00:01:04.121 --> 00:01:06.547
I think of something that's been policed.

00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:09.177
Back in the days, it was
expected for black people

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:10.865
to chemically treat their hair.

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:15.058
Whether that's healthy for them
is a secondary thing to blending in.

00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:18.539
In the 50s, dancer Ruth Beckford
and a lot of jazz singers

00:01:18.563 --> 00:01:20.448
were tired of straightening their hair,

00:01:20.472 --> 00:01:23.649
so they said, all right,
we're going to just let it grow naturally

00:01:23.673 --> 00:01:26.533
and started rocking natural,
close-cropped hair.

00:01:26.557 --> 00:01:29.567
And in the 60s, that style evolved

00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:31.317
with the formation of the Afro,

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:34.470
which was the cropped hair,
natural, picked out

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:37.227
into a more spherical shape.

00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:42.066
You had civil rights leaders, activists,
that adopted the hairstyle

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.919
as a means of rebellion and black pride.

00:01:44.943 --> 00:01:47.008
And then you had musicians
like James Brown,

00:01:47.032 --> 00:01:50.178
who was infamously known
for chemically straightening his hair,

00:01:50.202 --> 00:01:51.727
reject that and go natural.

00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:53.495
It went hand-in-hand with his music,

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:56.393
so he had songs like
"Say it Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud."

00:01:56.417 --> 00:01:58.148
The black is beautiful movement

00:01:58.172 --> 00:02:01.111
is just rejecting the notion
that to be black

00:02:01.135 --> 00:02:04.730
or to have darker skin,
to have a curlier grade of hair,

00:02:04.754 --> 00:02:06.897
was something to be ashamed of.

00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:09.398
I have one of my favorite
pictures of my mother

00:02:09.422 --> 00:02:10.710
and my grandmother,

00:02:10.734 --> 00:02:13.119
and my grandmother had a small 'fro,

00:02:13.143 --> 00:02:14.797
and that was in the 60s.

00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:18.847
African hair combs date back to 3500 BCE.

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:23.682
The oldest African combs are found
in ancient Egypt and Sudan,

00:02:23.706 --> 00:02:26.374
so they were making pyramids and combs.

00:02:26.398 --> 00:02:29.435
The way the ancient African
combs were embellished

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.899
represented status or tribal affiliation.

00:02:32.923 --> 00:02:37.381
It's no coincidence that the fist
on the modern Afro pick

00:02:37.405 --> 00:02:39.928
also sets the tone for affiliation

00:02:39.952 --> 00:02:41.991
and what set you claim.

00:02:42.015 --> 00:02:44.231
And then there's the Black Power movement.

00:02:44.255 --> 00:02:46.365
Most movements need their icons, right?

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:48.707
You have the fist, you have the 'fro.

00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:51.415
These things coincide with
the Black Panther aesthetic,

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.045
where you could kind of
spot your tribe from afar,

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.118
because you're not just keeping
a pick in, like, your beauty kit.

00:02:57.142 --> 00:02:58.672
It's in your back pocket,

00:02:58.696 --> 00:03:01.067
purposely with the first
outside of it,

00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:03.465
and in your hair,
you'll rock it in your 'fro.

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.400
If I think about iconic Afros,

00:03:05.424 --> 00:03:07.686
I definitely think about Angela Davis.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.764
Her 'fro personifies elegance, style,

00:03:10.788 --> 00:03:12.547
freedom, rebellion.

00:03:12.571 --> 00:03:14.427
You feel all of these feelings at once

00:03:14.451 --> 00:03:17.707
when you see Angela Davis
fighting for her life in federal court.

00:03:17.731 --> 00:03:21.289
By the 80s, the Afro style
became less radical.

00:03:21.313 --> 00:03:23.784
The Afro picks are still
produced to this day

00:03:23.808 --> 00:03:24.959
with the clenched fist,

00:03:24.983 --> 00:03:26.924
so it's the remnants of the movement

00:03:26.948 --> 00:03:28.745
in the everyday object.

00:03:29.193 --> 00:03:31.927
When I was young, it was
just, like, another object.

00:03:31.951 --> 00:03:33.144
It was a comb.

00:03:33.168 --> 00:03:35.384
But as I became more enlightened

00:03:35.408 --> 00:03:37.864
to really understand
the roots and the origin

00:03:37.888 --> 00:03:40.456
and the intentionality of the design

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.233
and why the fist
and all of these things ...

00:03:44.716 --> 00:03:46.161
I woke up.
