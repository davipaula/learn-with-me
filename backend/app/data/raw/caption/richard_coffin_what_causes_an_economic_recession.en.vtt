00:00:06.824 --> 00:00:08.004
For millennia,

00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:12.414
the people of Britain had been using 
bronze to make tools and jewelry,

00:00:12.414 --> 00:00:15.060
and as a currency for trade.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.100
But around 800 BCE, that began to change:

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.120
the value of bronze declined, causing 
social upheaval and an economic crisis—

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.766
what we would call a recession today.

00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:30.646
What causes recessions?

00:00:30.646 --> 00:00:35.066
This question has long been the subject 
of heated debate among economists,

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.546
and for good reason.

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:39.866
A recession can be a mild decline in 
economic activity

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:42.596
in a single country that lasts months,

00:00:42.596 --> 00:00:47.406
a long-lasting downturn with global 
ramifications that last years,

00:00:47.406 --> 00:00:49.846
or anything in between.

00:00:49.846 --> 00:00:51.376
Complicating matters further,

00:00:51.376 --> 00:00:55.026
there are countless variables that 
contribute to an economy’s health,

00:00:55.026 --> 00:00:59.026
making it difficult to pinpoint 
specific causes.

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:01.666
So it helps to start with the big picture:

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.776
recessions occur when there is a negative 
disruption

00:01:04.776 --> 00:01:07.636
to the balance between supply and demand.

00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:11.116
There’s a mismatch between how many 
goods people want to buy,

00:01:11.116 --> 00:01:14.256
how many products and services producers 
can offer,

00:01:14.256 --> 00:01:19.966
and the price of the goods and services 
sold, which prompts an economic decline.

00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:23.156
An economy’s relationship between supply 
and demand

00:01:23.156 --> 00:01:27.236
is reflected in its inflation rates 
and interest rates.

00:01:27.236 --> 00:01:31.686
Inflation happens when goods and services 
get more expensive.

00:01:31.686 --> 00:01:35.080
Put another way, the value 
of money decreases.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.950
Still, inflation isn’t necessarily 
a bad thing.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.570
In fact, a low inflation rate is thought 
to encourage economic activity.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.770
But high inflation that isn’t accompanied 
with high demand

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.520
can both cause problems for an economy 
and eventually lead to a recession.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.020
Interest rates, meanwhile,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.390
reflect the cost of taking on debt for 
individuals and companies.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.600
The rate is typically an annual percentage
of a loan

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.720
that borrowers pay to their creditors 
until the loan is repaid.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.790
Low interest rates mean that companies 
can afford to borrow more money,

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.490
which they can use to invest 
in more projects.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.290
High interest rates, meanwhile, increase 
costs for producers and consumers,

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.565
slowing economic activity.

00:02:19.565 --> 00:02:22.555
Fluctuations in inflation and interest 
rates

00:02:22.555 --> 00:02:25.385
can give us insight into the health 
of the economy,

00:02:25.385 --> 00:02:29.385
but what causes these fluctuations 
in the first place?

00:02:29.385 --> 00:02:33.605
The most obvious causes are shocks 
like natural disaster, war,

00:02:33.605 --> 00:02:35.717
and geopolitical factors.

00:02:35.717 --> 00:02:37.237
An earthquake, for example,

00:02:37.237 --> 00:02:42.247
can destroy the infrastructure needed to 
produce important commodities such as oil.

00:02:42.247 --> 00:02:47.557
That forces the supply side of the economy
to charge more for products that use oil,

00:02:47.557 --> 00:02:51.935
discouraging demand and potentially 
prompting a recession.

00:02:51.935 --> 00:02:55.624
But some recessions occur in times of 
economic prosperity—

00:02:55.624 --> 00:02:59.044
possibly even because 
of economic prosperity.

00:02:59.044 --> 00:03:03.344
Some economists believe that business 
activity from a market’s expansion

00:03:03.344 --> 00:03:06.608
can occasionally reach 
an unsustainable level.

00:03:06.608 --> 00:03:10.548
For example, corporations and consumers 
may borrow more money

00:03:10.548 --> 00:03:14.828
with the assumption that economic growth 
will help them handle the added burden.

00:03:14.828 --> 00:03:18.381
But if the economy doesn’t grow as 
quickly as expected,

00:03:18.381 --> 00:03:21.341
they may end up with more debt 
than they can manage.

00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:25.051
To pay it off, they’ll have to redirect 
funds from other activities,

00:03:25.051 --> 00:03:27.471
reducing business activity.

00:03:27.471 --> 00:03:30.391
Psychology can also contribute 
to a recession.

00:03:30.391 --> 00:03:34.551
Fear of a recession can become a 
self-fulfilling prophecy

00:03:34.551 --> 00:03:38.550
if it causes people to pull back investing
and spending.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.850
In response, producers might 
cut operating costs

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.930
to help weather the expected 
decline in demand.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.810
That can lead to a vicious cycle as cost 
cuts eventually lower wages,

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.800
leading to even lower demand.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.610
Even policy designed to help prevent 
recessions can contribute.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.740
When times are tough, governments and 
central banks may print money,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.500
increase spending, and lower central bank
interest rates.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.960
Smaller lenders can in turn lower their 
interest rates,

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.470
effectively making debt “cheaper” 
to boost spending.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.620
But these policies are not sustainable 
and eventually need to be reversed

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.822
to prevent excessive inflation.

00:04:18.822 --> 00:04:23.272
That can cause a recession if people have 
become too reliant on cheap debt

00:04:23.272 --> 00:04:25.202
and government stimulus.

00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:30.032
The Bronze recession in Britain eventually
ended when the adoption of iron

00:04:30.032 --> 00:04:33.256
helped revolutionize farming 
and food production.

00:04:33.256 --> 00:04:35.416
Modern markets are more complex,

00:04:35.416 --> 00:04:39.166
making today’s recessions far 
more difficult to navigate.

00:04:39.166 --> 00:04:43.486
But each recession provides new data to 
help anticipate and respond

00:04:43.486 --> 00:04:46.504
to future recessions more effectively.
