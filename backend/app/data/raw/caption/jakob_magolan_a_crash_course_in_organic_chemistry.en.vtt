00:00:12.623 --> 00:00:14.055
I'd like you to ask yourself,

00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:18.762
what do you feel when you hear
the words "organic chemistry?"

00:00:18.786 --> 00:00:19.952
What comes to mind?

00:00:20.763 --> 00:00:24.406
There is a course offered
at nearly every university,

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.319
and it's called Organic Chemistry,

00:00:26.343 --> 00:00:29.112
and it is a grueling, heavy
introduction to the subject,

00:00:30.252 --> 00:00:33.226
a flood of content
that overwhelms students,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.440
and you have to ace it if you want
to become a doctor or a dentist

00:00:37.464 --> 00:00:38.826
or a veterinarian.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.786
And that is why so many students
perceive this science like this ...

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:46.097
as an obstacle in their path,

00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:48.285
and they fear it and they hate it

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.452
and they call it a weed-out course.

00:00:50.476 --> 00:00:53.301
What a cruel thing for a subject
to do to young people,

00:00:53.325 --> 00:00:54.514
weed them out.

00:00:55.538 --> 00:00:59.318
And this perception spread
beyond college campuses long ago.

00:00:59.342 --> 00:01:03.014
There is a universal anxiety
about these two words.

00:01:04.963 --> 00:01:07.389
I happen to love this science,

00:01:07.413 --> 00:01:09.913
and I think this position
in which we have placed it

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:11.678
is inexcusable.

00:01:11.702 --> 00:01:15.563
It's not good for science,
and it's not good for society,

00:01:15.587 --> 00:01:18.154
and I don't think it has to be this way.

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:22.860
And I don't mean that this class
should be easier. It shouldn't.

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:27.636
But your perception of these two words

00:01:28.884 --> 00:01:33.273
should not be defined
by the experiences of premed students

00:01:33.297 --> 00:01:36.457
who frankly are going through
a very anxious time of their lives.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.175
So I'm here today because I believe

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:42.832
that a basic knowledge
of organic chemistry is valuable,

00:01:42.856 --> 00:01:47.468
and I think that it can be made
accessible to everybody,

00:01:47.492 --> 00:01:49.905
and I'd like to prove that to you today.

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:51.310
Would you let me try?

00:01:51.334 --> 00:01:52.862
Audience: Yeah!

00:01:52.886 --> 00:01:55.949
Jakob Magolan: All right, let's go for it.

00:01:55.973 --> 00:01:57.227
(Laughter)

00:01:57.251 --> 00:02:00.044
Here I have one of these
overpriced EpiPens.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.821
Inside it is a drug called epinephrine.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.384
Epinephrine can restart
the beat of my heart,

00:02:06.408 --> 00:02:08.973
or it could stop a life-threatening
allergic reaction.

00:02:08.997 --> 00:02:12.361
An injection of this
right here will do it.

00:02:13.076 --> 00:02:15.171
It would be like turning
the ignition switch

00:02:15.195 --> 00:02:17.225
in my body's fight-or-flight machinery.

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:21.066
My heart rate, my blood pressure would
go up so blood could rush to my muscles.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.026
My pupils would dilate.
I would feel a wave of strength.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.200
Epinephrine has been the difference
between life and death for many people.

00:02:29.224 --> 00:02:32.419
This is like a little miracle
that you can hold in your fingers.

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.761
Here is the chemical structure
of epinephrine.

00:02:37.753 --> 00:02:39.960
This is what organic chemistry looks like.

00:02:39.984 --> 00:02:42.245
It looks like lines and letters ...

00:02:43.362 --> 00:02:44.959
No meaning to most people.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.590
I'd like to show you what I see
when I look at that picture.

00:02:49.645 --> 00:02:51.484
I see a physical object

00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:55.421
that has depth and rotating parts,

00:02:55.445 --> 00:02:56.674
and it's moving.

00:02:58.864 --> 00:03:00.968
We call this a compound or a molecule,

00:03:00.992 --> 00:03:06.738
and it is 26 atoms that are stitched
together by atomic bonds.

00:03:07.443 --> 00:03:11.911
The unique arrangement of these atoms
gives epinephrine its identity,

00:03:11.935 --> 00:03:14.246
but nobody has ever
actually seen one of these,

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.724
because they're very small,

00:03:15.748 --> 00:03:18.896
so we're going to call this
an artistic impression,

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.150
and I want to explain to you
how small this is.

00:03:22.618 --> 00:03:26.762
In here, I have less than
half a milligram of it dissolved in water.

00:03:26.786 --> 00:03:28.359
It's the mass of a grain of sand.

00:03:28.383 --> 00:03:32.319
The number of epinephrine
molecules in here is one quintillion.

00:03:33.528 --> 00:03:34.987
That's 18 zeroes.

00:03:35.011 --> 00:03:36.583
That number is hard to visualize.

00:03:37.336 --> 00:03:40.021
Seven billion of us on this planet?

00:03:40.877 --> 00:03:45.632
Maybe 400 billion stars in our galaxy?

00:03:45.656 --> 00:03:46.807
You're not even close.

00:03:46.831 --> 00:03:48.928
If you wanted to get
into the right ballpark,

00:03:48.952 --> 00:03:51.669
you'd have to imagine every grain of sand

00:03:51.693 --> 00:03:55.289
on every beach,
under all the oceans and lakes,

00:03:55.313 --> 00:03:58.035
and then shrink them all
so they fit in here.

00:03:59.821 --> 00:04:02.671
Epinephrine is so small
we will never see it,

00:04:02.695 --> 00:04:05.051
not through any microscope ever,

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:07.544
but we know what it looks like,

00:04:07.568 --> 00:04:11.377
because it shows itself
through some sophisticated machines

00:04:11.401 --> 00:04:13.533
with fancy names

00:04:13.557 --> 00:04:15.962
like "nuclear magnetic
resonance spectrometers."

00:04:17.398 --> 00:04:20.669
So visible or not, we know
this molecule very well.

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:23.136
We know it is made
of four different types of atoms,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.073
hydrogen, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen.

00:04:25.097 --> 00:04:27.864
These are the colors
we typically use for them.

00:04:27.888 --> 00:04:30.515
Everything in our universe
is made of little spheres

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:31.715
that we call atoms.

00:04:31.739 --> 00:04:34.141
There's about a hundred
of these basic ingredients,

00:04:34.165 --> 00:04:36.524
and they're all made
from three smaller particles:

00:04:36.548 --> 00:04:38.184
protons, neutrons, electrons.

00:04:38.208 --> 00:04:41.120
We arrange these atoms
into this familiar table.

00:04:42.755 --> 00:04:44.978
We give them each a name and a number.

00:04:45.002 --> 00:04:47.328
But life as we know it
doesn't need all of these,

00:04:47.352 --> 00:04:49.867
just a smaller subset, just these.

00:04:50.671 --> 00:04:53.974
And there are four atoms in particular
that stand apart from the rest

00:04:53.998 --> 00:04:56.031
as the main building blocks of life,

00:04:56.055 --> 00:04:59.421
and they are the same ones
that are found in epinephrine:

00:04:59.445 --> 00:05:02.483
hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:07.427
Now what I tell you next
is the most important part.

00:05:08.443 --> 00:05:11.299
When these atoms
connect to form molecules,

00:05:11.323 --> 00:05:13.052
they follow a set of rules.

00:05:13.076 --> 00:05:15.338
Hydrogen makes one bond,

00:05:15.362 --> 00:05:17.108
oxygen always makes two,

00:05:17.132 --> 00:05:18.564
nitrogen makes three

00:05:18.588 --> 00:05:20.112
and carbon makes four.

00:05:20.857 --> 00:05:22.278
That's it.

00:05:22.302 --> 00:05:23.987
HONC -- one, two, three, four.

00:05:25.962 --> 00:05:29.678
If you can count to four,
and you can misspell the word "honk,"

00:05:29.702 --> 00:05:32.370
you're going to remember this
for the rest of your lives.

00:05:32.394 --> 00:05:34.046
(Laughter)

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.493
Now here I have four bowls
with these ingredients.

00:05:36.517 --> 00:05:39.281
We can use these to build molecules.

00:05:40.828 --> 00:05:42.407
Let's start with epinephrine.

00:05:43.464 --> 00:05:47.645
Now, these bonds between atoms,
they're made of electrons.

00:05:48.454 --> 00:05:51.747
Atoms use electrons like arms
to reach out and hold their neighbors.

00:05:51.771 --> 00:05:53.893
Two electrons in each bond,
like a handshake,

00:05:53.917 --> 00:05:56.014
and like a handshake,
they are not permanent.

00:05:56.038 --> 00:05:58.181
They can let go of one atom
and grab another.

00:05:58.205 --> 00:06:00.111
That's what we call a chemical reaction,

00:06:00.135 --> 00:06:02.996
when atoms exchange partners
and make new molecules.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.605
The backbone of epinephrine
is made mostly of carbon atoms,

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:07.787
and that's common.

00:06:07.811 --> 00:06:10.494
Carbon is life's favorite
structural building material,

00:06:10.518 --> 00:06:13.691
because it makes
a good number of handshakes

00:06:13.715 --> 00:06:15.723
with just the right grip strength.

00:06:15.747 --> 00:06:19.468
That's why we define organic chemistry
as the study of carbon molecules.

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:25.522
Now, if we build the smallest molecules
we can think of that follow our rules,

00:06:25.546 --> 00:06:28.118
they highlight our rules,
and they have familiar names:

00:06:28.142 --> 00:06:31.927
water, ammonia and methane,
H20 and NH3 and CH4.

00:06:33.739 --> 00:06:36.200
The words "hydrogen,"
"oxygen" and "nitrogen" --

00:06:36.224 --> 00:06:38.492
we use the same words

00:06:38.516 --> 00:06:41.167
to name these three molecules
that have two atoms each.

00:06:41.191 --> 00:06:42.532
They still follow the rules,

00:06:42.556 --> 00:06:45.224
because they have one, two
and three bonds between them.

00:06:45.248 --> 00:06:46.973
That's why oxygen gets called O2.

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.394
I can show you combustion.

00:06:51.323 --> 00:06:53.744
Here's carbon dioxide, CO2.

00:06:53.768 --> 00:06:58.672
Above it, let's place water and oxygen,
and beside it, some flammable fuels.

00:06:58.696 --> 00:07:00.998
These fuels are made
of just hydrogen and carbon.

00:07:01.022 --> 00:07:03.738
That's why we call them hydrocarbons.
We're very creative.

00:07:03.762 --> 00:07:05.218
(Laughter)

00:07:05.242 --> 00:07:07.385
So when these crash
into molecules of oxygen,

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:11.123
as they do in your engine
or in your barbecues,

00:07:12.091 --> 00:07:14.084
they release energy and they reassemble,

00:07:14.108 --> 00:07:17.100
and every carbon atom
ends up at the center of a CO2 molecule,

00:07:17.124 --> 00:07:18.366
holding on to two oxygens,

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.839
and all the hydrogens end up
as parts of waters,

00:07:20.863 --> 00:07:22.855
and everybody follows the rules.

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:24.197
They are not optional,

00:07:24.221 --> 00:07:26.699
and they're not optional
for bigger molecules either,

00:07:26.723 --> 00:07:28.141
like these three.

00:07:29.347 --> 00:07:31.522
This is our favorite vitamin

00:07:31.546 --> 00:07:33.196
sitting next to our favorite drug,

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.466
(Laughter)

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.229
and morphine is one of the most
important stories in medical history.

00:07:38.253 --> 00:07:41.165
It marks medicine's first
real triumph over physical pain,

00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:43.193
and every molecule has a story,

00:07:43.217 --> 00:07:44.801
and they are all published.

00:07:44.825 --> 00:07:48.291
They're written by scientists,
and they're read by other scientists,

00:07:48.315 --> 00:07:51.390
so we have handy representations
to do this quickly on paper,

00:07:51.414 --> 00:07:53.273
and I need to teach you how to do that.

00:07:53.297 --> 00:07:56.072
So we lay epinephrine flat on a page,

00:07:56.096 --> 00:07:58.776
and then we replace all the spheres
with simple letters,

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.295
and then the bonds
that lie in the plane of the page,

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:03.128
they just become regular lines,

00:08:03.152 --> 00:08:05.405
and the bonds that point
forwards and backwards,

00:08:05.429 --> 00:08:06.827
they become little triangles,

00:08:06.851 --> 00:08:08.990
either solid or dashed to indicate depth.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.561
We don't actually draw these carbons.

00:08:11.585 --> 00:08:14.396
We save time by just hiding them.

00:08:14.897 --> 00:08:18.033
They're represented
by corners between the bonds,

00:08:18.057 --> 00:08:21.690
and we also hide every hydrogen
that's bonded to a carbon.

00:08:22.583 --> 00:08:23.741
We know they're there

00:08:23.765 --> 00:08:26.663
whenever a carbon is showing us
any fewer than four bonds.

00:08:27.853 --> 00:08:30.789
The last thing that's done
is the bonds between OH and NH.

00:08:31.432 --> 00:08:33.520
We just get rid of those
to make it cleaner,

00:08:33.544 --> 00:08:35.021
and that's all there is to it.

00:08:35.045 --> 00:08:37.625
This is the professional way
to draw molecules.

00:08:37.649 --> 00:08:40.060
This is what you see on Wikipedia pages.

00:08:42.793 --> 00:08:46.555
It takes a little bit of practice,
but I think everyone here could do it,

00:08:46.579 --> 00:08:49.305
but for today, this is epinephrine.

00:08:49.886 --> 00:08:52.814
This is also called adrenaline.
They're one and the same.

00:08:52.838 --> 00:08:54.450
It's made by your adrenal glands.

00:08:54.474 --> 00:08:57.426
You have this molecule swimming
through your body right now.

00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.140
It's a natural molecule.

00:08:59.164 --> 00:09:03.408
This EpiPen would just give you
a quick quintillion more of them.

00:09:03.432 --> 00:09:05.082
(Laughter)

00:09:05.106 --> 00:09:08.297
We can extract epinephrine

00:09:08.321 --> 00:09:11.741
from the adrenal glands
of sheep or cattle,

00:09:11.765 --> 00:09:14.099
but that's not
where this stuff comes from.

00:09:14.123 --> 00:09:16.991
We make this epinephrine in a factory

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:22.254
by stitching together smaller molecules
that come mostly from petroleum.

00:09:23.322 --> 00:09:25.031
And this is 100 percent synthetic.

00:09:25.862 --> 00:09:29.115
And that word, "synthetic,"
makes some of us uncomfortable.

00:09:29.964 --> 00:09:33.259
It's not like the word "natural,"
which makes us feel safe.

00:09:33.283 --> 00:09:36.925
But these two molecules,
they cannot be distinguished.

00:09:38.263 --> 00:09:42.159
We're not talking about two cars
that are coming off an assembly line here.

00:09:42.183 --> 00:09:44.224
A car can have a scratch on it,

00:09:44.248 --> 00:09:46.103
and you can't scratch an atom.

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:50.675
These two are identical in a surreal,
almost mathematical sense.

00:09:50.699 --> 00:09:53.800
At this atomic scale,
math practically touches reality.

00:09:54.128 --> 00:09:55.747
And a molecule of epinephrine ...

00:09:56.779 --> 00:09:58.478
it has no memory of its origin.

00:09:58.502 --> 00:09:59.907
It just is what it is,

00:09:59.931 --> 00:10:01.082
and once you have it,

00:10:01.106 --> 00:10:05.517
the words "natural" and "synthetic,"
they don't matter,

00:10:06.284 --> 00:10:09.496
and nature synthesizes
this molecule just like we do,

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.807
except nature is much better
at this than we are.

00:10:11.831 --> 00:10:14.209
Before there was life on earth,

00:10:14.233 --> 00:10:17.240
all the molecules were small, simple:

00:10:17.264 --> 00:10:18.915
carbon dioxide, water, nitrogen,

00:10:20.018 --> 00:10:21.168
just simple things.

00:10:21.192 --> 00:10:23.140
The emergence of life changed that.

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:26.400
Life brought biosynthetic factories
that are powered by sunlight,

00:10:26.424 --> 00:10:29.939
and inside these factories,
small molecules crash into each other

00:10:29.963 --> 00:10:33.271
and become large ones:
carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids,

00:10:33.295 --> 00:10:35.748
multitudes of spectacular creations.

00:10:37.613 --> 00:10:39.938
Nature is the original organic chemist,

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:44.355
and her construction also fills our sky
with the oxygen gas we breathe,

00:10:44.379 --> 00:10:45.847
this high-energy oxygen.

00:10:47.597 --> 00:10:50.858
All of these molecules are infused
with the energy of the sun.

00:10:50.882 --> 00:10:52.350
They store it like batteries.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:55.652
So nature is made of chemicals.

00:10:56.251 --> 00:10:59.188
Maybe you guys can help me
to reclaim this word, "chemical,"

00:10:59.212 --> 00:11:01.711
because it has been stolen from us.

00:11:01.735 --> 00:11:04.434
It doesn't mean toxic,
and it doesn't mean harmful,

00:11:04.458 --> 00:11:07.093
and it doesn't mean man-made or unnatural.

00:11:07.117 --> 00:11:10.370
It just means "stuff," OK?

00:11:10.394 --> 00:11:11.915
(Laughter)

00:11:11.939 --> 00:11:15.975
You can't have
chemical-free lump charcoal.

00:11:15.999 --> 00:11:17.209
That is ridiculous.

00:11:17.233 --> 00:11:18.234
(Laughter)

00:11:18.258 --> 00:11:20.091
And I'd like to do one more word.

00:11:20.932 --> 00:11:23.607
The word "natural" doesn't mean "safe,"

00:11:23.631 --> 00:11:26.139
and you all know that.

00:11:26.163 --> 00:11:30.646
Plenty of nature's
chemicals are quite toxic,

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.273
and others are delicious,

00:11:33.297 --> 00:11:35.219
and some are both ...

00:11:35.243 --> 00:11:36.614
(Laughter)

00:11:36.638 --> 00:11:38.328
toxic and delicious.

00:11:38.813 --> 00:11:41.591
The only way to tell
whether something is harmful

00:11:41.615 --> 00:11:43.487
is to test it,

00:11:43.511 --> 00:11:45.669
and I don't mean you guys.

00:11:45.693 --> 00:11:48.502
Professional toxicologists:
we have these people.

00:11:48.526 --> 00:11:50.040
They're well-trained,

00:11:50.064 --> 00:11:52.066
and you should trust them like I do.

00:11:52.893 --> 00:11:54.663
So nature's molecules are everywhere,

00:11:54.687 --> 00:11:56.560
including the ones that have decomposed

00:11:56.584 --> 00:11:58.894
into these black mixtures
that we call petroleum.

00:11:58.918 --> 00:12:01.148
We refine these molecules.

00:12:01.695 --> 00:12:03.514
There's nothing unnatural about them.

00:12:03.538 --> 00:12:04.688
We purify them.

00:12:06.228 --> 00:12:09.196
Now, our dependence on them for energy --

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.229
that means that every one of those carbons
gets converted into a molecule of CO2.

00:12:13.253 --> 00:12:16.197
That's a greenhouse gas
that is messing up our climate.

00:12:16.221 --> 00:12:19.912
Maybe knowing this chemistry
will make that reality easier to accept

00:12:19.936 --> 00:12:21.406
for some people, I don't know,

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:23.713
but these molecules
are not just fossil fuels.

00:12:24.523 --> 00:12:27.165
They're also the cheapest
available raw materials

00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:29.523
for doing something
that we call synthesis.

00:12:30.195 --> 00:12:32.297
We're using them like pieces of LEGO.

00:12:33.083 --> 00:12:37.370
We have learned how to connect them
or break them apart with great control.

00:12:37.394 --> 00:12:39.000
I have done a lot of this myself,

00:12:39.024 --> 00:12:41.373
and I still think it's amazing
it's even possible.

00:12:41.397 --> 00:12:44.699
What we do is kind of like assembling LEGO

00:12:44.723 --> 00:12:47.755
by dumping boxes of it
into washing machines,

00:12:47.779 --> 00:12:49.084
but it works.

00:12:49.108 --> 00:12:53.321
We can make molecules that are
exact copies of nature, like epinephrine,

00:12:53.345 --> 00:12:57.337
or we can make creations of our own
from scratch, like these two.

00:12:57.361 --> 00:13:01.631
One of these eases the symptoms
of multiple sclerosis;

00:13:01.655 --> 00:13:05.442
the other one cures a type of blood cancer
that we call T-cell lymphoma.

00:13:05.466 --> 00:13:09.698
A molecule with the right size and shape,
it's like a key in a lock,

00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:13.197
and when it fits, it interferes
with the chemistry of a disease.

00:13:13.221 --> 00:13:14.514
That's how drugs work.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.200
Natural or synthetic,

00:13:17.224 --> 00:13:20.684
they're all just molecules that happen
to fit snugly somewhere important.

00:13:20.708 --> 00:13:23.388
But nature is much better
at making them than we are,

00:13:23.412 --> 00:13:25.524
so hers look more impressive than ours,

00:13:25.548 --> 00:13:27.126
like this one.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.095
This is called vancomycin.

00:13:29.119 --> 00:13:32.182
She gave this majestic beast
two chlorine atoms

00:13:32.206 --> 00:13:34.391
to wear like a pair of earrings.

00:13:34.415 --> 00:13:39.582
We found vancomycin in a puddle of mud
in a jungle in Borneo in 1953.

00:13:39.606 --> 00:13:41.422
It's made by a bacteria.

00:13:42.355 --> 00:13:45.101
We can't synthesize this
cost-efficiently in a lab.

00:13:45.798 --> 00:13:50.117
It's too complicated for us, but we
can harvest it from its natural source,

00:13:50.141 --> 00:13:54.324
and we do, because this is
one of our most powerful antibiotics.

00:13:54.348 --> 00:13:57.303
And new molecules are reported
in our literature every day.

00:13:57.327 --> 00:14:00.557
We make them or we find them
in every corner of this planet.

00:14:01.982 --> 00:14:03.673
And that's where drugs come from,

00:14:03.697 --> 00:14:05.942
and that's why your doctors
have amazing powers ...

00:14:05.966 --> 00:14:06.988
(Laughter)

00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:09.218
to cure deadly infections
and everything else.

00:14:09.242 --> 00:14:12.957
Being a physician today
is like being a knight in shining armor.

00:14:13.948 --> 00:14:16.849
They fight battles
with courage and composure,

00:14:16.873 --> 00:14:18.493
but also with good equipment.

00:14:18.517 --> 00:14:22.535
So let's not forget the role
of the blacksmith in this picture,

00:14:22.559 --> 00:14:26.022
because without the blacksmith,
things would look a little different ...

00:14:26.046 --> 00:14:28.139
(Laughter)

00:14:28.163 --> 00:14:30.496
But this science is bigger than medicine.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:36.739
It is oils and solvents and flavors,
fabrics, all plastics,

00:14:36.763 --> 00:14:39.033
the cushions that
you're sitting on right now --

00:14:39.057 --> 00:14:41.517
they're all manufactured,
and they're mostly carbon,

00:14:41.541 --> 00:14:43.575
so that makes all of it organic chemistry.

00:14:43.599 --> 00:14:45.788
This is a rich science.

00:14:45.812 --> 00:14:47.666
I left out a lot today:

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:50.875
phosphorus and sulfur and the other atoms,

00:14:51.812 --> 00:14:54.097
and why they all bond the way they do,

00:14:54.121 --> 00:14:55.376
and symmetry

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.221
and non-bonding electrons,

00:14:57.245 --> 00:14:58.789
and atoms that are charged,

00:14:58.813 --> 00:15:01.909
and reactions and their mechanisms,
and it goes on and on and on,

00:15:01.933 --> 00:15:03.943
and synthesis takes a long time to learn.

00:15:03.967 --> 00:15:06.848
But I didn't come here to teach
you guys organic chemistry --

00:15:06.872 --> 00:15:08.714
I just wanted to show it to you,

00:15:08.738 --> 00:15:13.777
and I had a lot of help with that today
from a young man named Weston Durland,

00:15:13.801 --> 00:15:15.277
and you've already seen him.

00:15:16.427 --> 00:15:18.578
He's an undergraduate
student in chemistry,

00:15:18.602 --> 00:15:21.880
and he also happens to be
pretty good with computer graphics.

00:15:21.904 --> 00:15:23.641
(Laughter)

00:15:23.665 --> 00:15:27.753
So Weston designed
all the moving molecules

00:15:27.777 --> 00:15:29.189
that you saw today.

00:15:29.213 --> 00:15:32.453
He and I wanted to demonstrate
through the use of graphics like these

00:15:32.477 --> 00:15:34.935
to help someone talk
about this intricate science.

00:15:35.316 --> 00:15:37.657
But our main goal was just to show you

00:15:37.681 --> 00:15:40.640
that organic chemistry
is not something to be afraid of.

00:15:41.418 --> 00:15:44.608
It is, at its core, a window

00:15:44.632 --> 00:15:48.341
through which the beauty
of the natural world looks richer.

00:15:48.365 --> 00:15:49.516
Thank you.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.807
(Applause)
