00:00:12.865 --> 00:00:14.465
Let's talk about thrift.

00:00:15.206 --> 00:00:19.744
Thrift is a concept where you
reduce, reuse and recycle,

00:00:19.768 --> 00:00:23.326
but yet with an economic aspect
I think has a real potential for change.

00:00:25.209 --> 00:00:27.343
My grandmother, she knew about thrift.

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:29.058
This is her string jar.

00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:30.478
She never bought any string.

00:00:30.502 --> 00:00:32.218
Basically, she would collect string.

00:00:32.242 --> 00:00:35.163
It would come from the butcher's,
it would come from presents.

00:00:35.187 --> 00:00:38.182
She would put it in the jar
and then use it when it was needed.

00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:40.780
When it was finished,
whether it was tying up the roses

00:00:40.804 --> 00:00:41.955
or a part of my bike,

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:44.362
once finished with that,
it'd go back into the jar.

00:00:44.386 --> 00:00:47.017
This is a perfect idea of thrift;
you use what you need,

00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:49.732
you don't actually purchase anything,
so you save money.

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:52.676
Kids also inherently know this idea.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.707
When you want to throw out
a cardboard box,

00:00:54.731 --> 00:00:57.900
the average kid will say, "Don't!
I want to use it for a robot head

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:00.164
or for a canoe to paddle down a river."

00:01:00.188 --> 00:01:03.622
They understand the value
of the second life of products.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.783
So, I think thrift is
a perfect counterpoint

00:01:07.807 --> 00:01:09.553
to the current age which we live in.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.214
All of our current products
are replaceable.

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.592
When we get that bright, new, shiny toy,

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:17.078
it's because, basically,
we got rid of the old one.

00:01:17.807 --> 00:01:21.789
The idea of that is, of course,
it's great in the moment,

00:01:21.813 --> 00:01:24.727
but the challenge is,
as we keep doing this,

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.457
we're going to cause a problem.

00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:29.791
That problem is that
there is really no way.

00:01:29.815 --> 00:01:33.248
When you throw something away,
it typically goes into a landfill.

00:01:33.903 --> 00:01:37.482
Now, a landfill is basically something
which is not going to go away,

00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:38.672
and it's increasing.

00:01:38.696 --> 00:01:43.139
At the moment, we have about
1.3 billion tons of material every year

00:01:43.163 --> 00:01:44.616
going into landfills.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.336
By 2100, it's going to be
about four billion tons.

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:50.663
See, instead, I'd prefer
if we started thrifting.

00:01:51.122 --> 00:01:56.234
What that means is, we consider materials
when they go into products

00:01:56.258 --> 00:01:57.649
and also when they get used,

00:01:57.673 --> 00:02:00.457
and, at the end of their life:
When can they be used again?

00:02:00.481 --> 00:02:03.594
It's the idea of completely changing
the way we think about waste,

00:02:03.618 --> 00:02:05.391
so waste is no longer a dirty word --

00:02:05.415 --> 00:02:07.550
we almost remove
the word "waste" completely.

00:02:07.574 --> 00:02:09.473
All we're looking to is resources.

00:02:09.497 --> 00:02:10.831
Resource goes into a product

00:02:10.855 --> 00:02:13.251
and then can basically go
into another product.

00:02:15.228 --> 00:02:16.861
We used to be good at thrifting.

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:19.942
My grandmother, again,
used to use old seed packets

00:02:19.966 --> 00:02:21.369
to paper the bathroom walls.

00:02:21.393 --> 00:02:24.830
I think, though, there are companies
out there who understand this value

00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:26.060
and are promoting it.

00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:29.879
And a lot of the technologies
that have been developed for the smart age

00:02:29.903 --> 00:02:33.900
can also be adapted to reduce,
reuse and also thrift more proficiently.

00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:36.323
And as a materials scientist,

00:02:36.347 --> 00:02:38.942
what I've been tracking
over the last couple of decades

00:02:38.966 --> 00:02:41.245
is how companies
are getting smart at thrifting,

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.300
how they're able
to understand this concept

00:02:43.324 --> 00:02:44.498
and profit from it.

00:02:45.341 --> 00:02:47.067
I'm going to give you two examples.

00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:49.711
The first one, a good one;
the second one, not so good.

00:02:49.735 --> 00:02:51.797
The first is the automotive industry.

00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:54.938
Not always known as the most
innovative or creative of industries,

00:02:54.962 --> 00:02:58.490
but it turns out, they're really,
really good at recycling their products.

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:01.727
Ninety-five percent of every single car
that goes on the road

00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:03.061
gets recycled here.

00:03:03.085 --> 00:03:06.418
And of that car, about
75 percent of the entire car

00:03:06.442 --> 00:03:08.109
actually gets used again.

00:03:08.584 --> 00:03:11.154
That includes, of course,
the old steel and aluminum

00:03:11.178 --> 00:03:14.991
but then also the plastics
from the fender and the interiors,

00:03:15.015 --> 00:03:17.006
glass from the windows and the windshield

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.498
and also the tires.

00:03:18.522 --> 00:03:22.514
There's a mature and successful industry
that deals with these old cars

00:03:22.538 --> 00:03:25.561
and basically recycles them
and puts them back into use

00:03:25.585 --> 00:03:27.711
as new cars or other new products.

00:03:28.165 --> 00:03:30.910
Even as we move towards
battery-powered cars,

00:03:31.496 --> 00:03:34.553
there are companies that claim
they can recycle up to 90 percent

00:03:34.577 --> 00:03:38.318
of the 11 million tons of batteries
that are going to be with us in 2020.

00:03:39.117 --> 00:03:40.602
That, I think, is not perfect,

00:03:40.626 --> 00:03:42.982
but it's certainly good,
and it's getting better.

00:03:43.403 --> 00:03:46.700
The industry that's not doing so well
is the architecture industry.

00:03:48.045 --> 00:03:50.648
One of the challenges
with architecture has always been

00:03:50.672 --> 00:03:53.077
when we build up, we don't think
about taking down.

00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:56.466
We don't dismantle,
we don't disassemble, we demolish.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.649
That's a challenge,

00:03:57.673 --> 00:04:00.953
because it ends up that about a third
of all landfill waste in the US

00:04:00.977 --> 00:04:02.142
is architecture.

00:04:02.911 --> 00:04:04.895
We need to think differently about this.

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:08.053
There are programs that can actually
reduce some of this material.

00:04:08.077 --> 00:04:09.323
A good example is this.

00:04:09.347 --> 00:04:12.688
These are actually bricks that are made
from old demolition waste,

00:04:12.712 --> 00:04:16.101
which includes the glass,
the rubble, the concrete.

00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:18.707
You put up a grinder,
put it all together, heat it up

00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:21.810
and make these bricks we can
basically build more buildings from.

00:04:21.834 --> 00:04:23.805
But it's only a fraction of what we need.

00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:28.410
My hope is that with big data
and geotagging,

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:29.776
we can actually change that,

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.053
and be more thrifty
when it comes to buildings.

00:04:32.077 --> 00:04:35.212
If there's a building down the block
which is being demolished,

00:04:35.236 --> 00:04:36.664
are there materials there

00:04:36.688 --> 00:04:39.140
that the new building
being built here can use?

00:04:39.482 --> 00:04:42.165
Can we use that, the ability to understand

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:45.372
that all the materials available
in that building are still usable?

00:04:45.396 --> 00:04:48.085
Can we then basically put them
into a new building,

00:04:48.752 --> 00:04:51.512
without actually losing
any value in the process?

00:04:53.068 --> 00:04:55.164
So now let's think about other industries.

00:04:55.188 --> 00:04:57.715
What are other industries doing
to create thrift?

00:04:57.739 --> 00:05:00.301
Well, it turns out
that there are plenty of industries

00:05:00.325 --> 00:05:02.386
that are also thinking
about their own waste

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.701
and what we can do with it.

00:05:03.725 --> 00:05:06.609
A simple example is the waste
that they basically belch out

00:05:06.633 --> 00:05:08.202
as part of industrial processes.

00:05:08.226 --> 00:05:11.397
Most metal smelters give off
an awful lot of carbon dioxide.

00:05:11.704 --> 00:05:14.228
Turns out, there's a company
called Land Detector

00:05:14.252 --> 00:05:17.255
that's actually working in China
and also soon in South Africa,

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:20.178
that's able to take that waste gas --

00:05:20.202 --> 00:05:23.474
about 700,000 tons per smelter --

00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:27.048
and then turn it into
about 400,000 tons of ethanol,

00:05:27.072 --> 00:05:31.615
which is equivalent to basically powering
250,000, or quarter of a million, cars

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:32.790
for a year.

00:05:32.814 --> 00:05:34.694
That's a very effective use of waste.

00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:38.589
How about products more close to home?

00:05:38.613 --> 00:05:40.276
This is a simple solution.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.164
And it, again, takes the idea
of reducing, reusing,

00:05:43.188 --> 00:05:45.331
but then also with economic advantage.

00:05:45.355 --> 00:05:48.260
So it's a simple process
of changing from a cut and sew,

00:05:48.284 --> 00:05:51.435
where typically between
20 and 30 materials are used

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:55.418
which are cut from a large cloth and then
sewn together or even sometimes glued,

00:05:55.442 --> 00:05:58.118
they changed it and said
that they just knitted the shoe.

00:05:58.142 --> 00:06:01.403
The advantage with this is not just
a simplification of the process,

00:06:01.427 --> 00:06:04.594
it's also, "I've got one material.
I have zero waste,"

00:06:04.618 --> 00:06:08.474
and then also, "I'm able to potentially
recycle that at the end of its life."

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.569
Digital manufacturing is also allowing us
to do this more effectively.

00:06:13.593 --> 00:06:16.904
In this case, it's actually creating
the theoretical limit of strength

00:06:16.928 --> 00:06:18.080
for a material:

00:06:18.104 --> 00:06:20.686
you cannot get any stronger
for the amount of material

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.879
than this shape.

00:06:22.624 --> 00:06:24.244
So it's a basic simple block,

00:06:24.268 --> 00:06:27.851
but the idea is, I can extrapolate this,
I can make it into large formats,

00:06:27.875 --> 00:06:29.869
I can make it into buildings, bridges,

00:06:29.893 --> 00:06:31.829
but also airplane wings and shoes.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.094
The idea here is, I'm minimizing
the amount of material.

00:06:36.101 --> 00:06:38.138
Here's a good example from architecture.

00:06:38.895 --> 00:06:43.030
Typically, these sorts of metal nodes
are used to hold up large tent structures.

00:06:43.054 --> 00:06:45.991
In this case, it in was in the Hague,
along a shopping center.

00:06:46.015 --> 00:06:48.470
They used 1600
of the materials on the left.

00:06:48.982 --> 00:06:51.530
The difference is, by using
the solution on the right,

00:06:51.554 --> 00:06:54.371
they cut down the number of steps
from seven to one,

00:06:54.395 --> 00:06:56.672
because the one on the left
is currently welded,

00:06:56.696 --> 00:06:58.746
the one on the right
is simply just printed.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.961
And it was able to reduce waste to zero,

00:07:00.985 --> 00:07:02.548
cost less money

00:07:02.572 --> 00:07:04.738
and also, because it's made out of steel,

00:07:04.762 --> 00:07:07.237
can be eventually recycled
at the end of its life.

00:07:09.824 --> 00:07:12.497
Nature also is very effective at thrift.

00:07:12.521 --> 00:07:14.728
Think about it: nature has zero waste.

00:07:14.752 --> 00:07:16.887
Everything is useful for another process.

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:19.664
So, in this case, nanocellulose,

00:07:19.688 --> 00:07:22.943
which is basically one of the very fine
building blocks of cellulose,

00:07:22.967 --> 00:07:26.637
which is one of the materials
that makes trees strong,

00:07:27.053 --> 00:07:30.339
you can isolate it, and it works
very much like carbon fiber.

00:07:30.363 --> 00:07:33.141
So, take that from a tree,
form it into fibers,

00:07:33.165 --> 00:07:35.356
and then those fibers
can strengthen things,

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.980
such as airplanes, buildings, cars.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:41.095
The advantage of this, though,
is it's not just bioderived,

00:07:41.119 --> 00:07:42.745
comes from a renewable resource,

00:07:42.769 --> 00:07:44.609
but also that it is transparent,

00:07:44.633 --> 00:07:48.013
so it can be used in consumer electronics,
as well as food packaging.

00:07:48.363 --> 00:07:51.406
Not bad for something that basically
comes from the backyard.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.260
Another one from the biosource
is synthetic spider silk.

00:07:54.921 --> 00:07:58.514
Now, it's very hard to actually
create spider silk naturally.

00:07:58.538 --> 00:08:00.358
You can basically get it from spiders,

00:08:00.382 --> 00:08:03.539
but in large numbers, they tend
to kill each other, eat each other,

00:08:03.563 --> 00:08:05.524
so you've got a problem with creating it,

00:08:05.548 --> 00:08:07.504
in the same way you do with regular silk.

00:08:07.528 --> 00:08:10.324
So what you can do is instead
take the DNA from the spider,

00:08:10.348 --> 00:08:12.333
and put it into various different things.

00:08:12.357 --> 00:08:15.046
You can put it into bacteria,
you can put it into yeast,

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:16.276
you can put it into milk.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.236
And what you can do then is,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.188
the milk or the bacteria produce
in much larger volumes

00:08:21.212 --> 00:08:25.297
and then from that, spin a yarn
and then create a fabric or a rope.

00:08:25.677 --> 00:08:29.240
Again, bioderived, has incredible
strength -- about the same as Kevlar --

00:08:29.264 --> 00:08:32.344
so they're using it in things like
bulletproof vests and helmets

00:08:32.368 --> 00:08:33.521
and outdoor jackets.

00:08:33.545 --> 00:08:34.848
It has a great performance.

00:08:34.872 --> 00:08:37.469
But again, it's bioderived,
and at the end of its life,

00:08:37.493 --> 00:08:40.232
it potentially can go back
into the soil and get composted

00:08:40.256 --> 00:08:42.552
to again be potentially used
as a new material.

00:08:44.201 --> 00:08:46.979
I'd like to leave you with one
last form which is biobased,

00:08:47.003 --> 00:08:49.217
but this, I think,
is like the ultimate thrift.

00:08:49.241 --> 00:08:51.955
Think about the poster child
for conspicuous consumption.

00:08:51.979 --> 00:08:53.248
It's the water bottle.

00:08:53.712 --> 00:08:56.595
We have too many of them,
they're basically going everywhere,

00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.457
they're a problem in the ocean.

00:08:58.481 --> 00:09:00.014
What do we do with them?

00:09:00.038 --> 00:09:02.617
This process is able
not just to recycle them,

00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:04.139
but to recycle them infinitely.

00:09:04.163 --> 00:09:05.420
Why is that interesting?

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:07.945
Because when we think
about reusing and recycling,

00:09:08.538 --> 00:09:13.680
metals, glass, things like that,
can be recycled as many times as you like.

00:09:13.704 --> 00:09:15.266
There's metal in your car

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.084
that may well have come
from a 1950s Oldsmobile,

00:09:18.108 --> 00:09:21.259
because you can recycle it infinitely
with no loss of performance.

00:09:21.283 --> 00:09:23.990
Plastics offer about
once or twice of recycling,

00:09:24.014 --> 00:09:26.188
whether it's a bottle,
whether it's a chair --

00:09:26.212 --> 00:09:27.809
whatever it is, if it's carpet --

00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:31.403
after two times of recycling, whether
it goes back into another chair, etc,

00:09:31.427 --> 00:09:33.921
it tends to lose strength,
it's no longer of any use.

00:09:33.945 --> 00:09:37.436
This, though, just using a few enzymes,
is able to recycle it infinitely.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.905
I take a bottle or a chair
or some other plastic product,

00:09:40.929 --> 00:09:44.228
I basically put it in with a few enzymes,
they break it apart,

00:09:44.252 --> 00:09:46.866
they basically put it back
into its original molecules.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:48.341
And then from those molecules,

00:09:48.365 --> 00:09:51.247
you can build another chair
or carpet or bottle.

00:09:51.673 --> 00:09:53.406
So, the cycle is infinite.

00:09:53.966 --> 00:09:55.664
The advantage with that, of course,

00:09:55.688 --> 00:09:58.942
is that you have potentially
zero loss of material resources.

00:09:58.966 --> 00:10:00.890
Again, the perfect idea of thrift.

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:06.682
So in conclusion, I just want to have
you think about -- if you make anything,

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:08.475
if you're any part of a design firm,

00:10:08.499 --> 00:10:11.101
if you basically
are refurbishing your house --

00:10:11.125 --> 00:10:13.736
any aspect where you make something,

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.974
think about how that product
could potentially be used

00:10:16.998 --> 00:10:19.394
as a second life, or third life
or fourth life.

00:10:19.418 --> 00:10:22.182
Design in the ability for it
to be taken apart.

00:10:23.466 --> 00:10:25.236
That, to me, is the ultimate thrift,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.349
and I think that's basically
what my grandmother would love.

00:10:28.373 --> 00:10:32.986
(Applause)
