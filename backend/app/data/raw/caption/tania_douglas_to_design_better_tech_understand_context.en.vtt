00:00:12.818 --> 00:00:15.040
This is an equipment graveyard.

00:00:15.064 --> 00:00:17.292
It's a typical final resting place

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:20.102
for medical equipment
from hospitals in Africa.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.135
Now, why is this?

00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:26.828
Most of the medical devices
used in Africa are imported,

00:00:26.852 --> 00:00:30.496
and quite often, they're not suitable
for local conditions.

00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:34.345
They may require trained staff

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:38.024
that aren't available to operate
and maintain and repair them;

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.508
they may not be able to withstand
high temperatures and humidity;

00:00:42.532 --> 00:00:46.994
and they usually require a constant
and reliable supply of electricity.

00:00:48.104 --> 00:00:50.203
An example of a medical device

00:00:50.227 --> 00:00:54.429
that may have ended up
in an equipment graveyard at some point

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.609
is an ultrasound monitor
to track the heart rate of unborn babies.

00:01:00.447 --> 00:01:03.878
This is the standard of care
in rich countries.

00:01:03.902 --> 00:01:07.648
In low-resource settings,
the standard of care is often

00:01:07.672 --> 00:01:10.881
a midwife listening
to the baby's heart rate

00:01:10.905 --> 00:01:12.059
through a horn.

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.660
Now, this approach has been around
for more than a century.

00:01:16.684 --> 00:01:21.169
It's very much dependent on the skill
and the experience of the midwife.

00:01:22.528 --> 00:01:25.333
Two young inventors from Uganda

00:01:25.357 --> 00:01:29.889
visited an antenatal clinic
at a local hospital a few years ago,

00:01:29.913 --> 00:01:32.745
when they were students
in information technology.

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:36.093
They noticed that quite often,

00:01:36.117 --> 00:01:39.201
the midwife was not able
to hear any heart rate

00:01:39.225 --> 00:01:41.913
when trying to listen to it
through this horn.

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:47.202
So they invented their own
fetal heart rate monitor.

00:01:48.156 --> 00:01:52.755
They adapted the horn
and connected it to a smartphone.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:57.272
An app on the smartphone
records the heart rate, analyzes it

00:01:57.296 --> 00:02:00.200
and provides the midwife
with a range of information

00:02:00.224 --> 00:02:01.979
on the status of the baby.

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:04.841
These inventors --

00:02:04.865 --> 00:02:06.087
(Applause)

00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:09.214
are called Aaron Tushabe
and Joshua Okello.

00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:13.954
Another inventor, Tendekayi Katsiga,

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.327
was working for an NGO in Botswana
that manufactured hearing aids.

00:02:20.738 --> 00:02:25.835
Now, he noticed that
these hearing aids needed batteries

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.056
that needed replacement,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.714
very often at a cost
that was not affordable

00:02:29.738 --> 00:02:31.840
for most of the users that he knew.

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:37.240
In response, and being an engineer,
Tendekayi invented

00:02:37.264 --> 00:02:40.874
a solar-powered battery charger
with rechargeable batteries,

00:02:40.898 --> 00:02:43.217
that could be used in these hearing aids.

00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:47.527
He cofounded a company called Deaftronics,

00:02:47.551 --> 00:02:50.211
which now manufactures the Solar Ear,

00:02:50.727 --> 00:02:53.976
which is a hearing aid powered
by his invention.

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:01.066
My colleague, Sudesh Sivarasu,
invented a smart glove

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.256
for people who have suffered from leprosy.

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.804
Even though their disease
may have been cured,

00:03:06.828 --> 00:03:09.984
the resulting nerve damage
will have left many of them

00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:12.546
without a sense of touch in their hands.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.628
This puts them at risk of injury.

00:03:16.017 --> 00:03:20.042
The glove has sensors
to detect temperature and pressure

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:21.447
and warn the user.

00:03:22.581 --> 00:03:26.090
It effectively serves
as an artificial sense of touch

00:03:26.114 --> 00:03:27.580
and prevents injury.

00:03:28.032 --> 00:03:32.721
Sudesh invented this glove
after observing former leprosy patients

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:35.691
as they carried out
their day-to-day activities,

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:39.304
and he learned about the risks
and the hazards in their environment.

00:03:41.774 --> 00:03:43.954
Now, the inventors that I've mentioned

00:03:43.978 --> 00:03:46.657
integrated engineering with healthcare.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.495
This is what biomedical engineers do.

00:03:50.558 --> 00:03:52.463
At the University of Cape Town,

00:03:52.487 --> 00:03:55.644
we run a course called
Health Innovation and Design.

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:59.615
It's taken by many of our graduate
students in biomedical engineering.

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:03.703
The aim of the course
is to introduce these students

00:04:03.727 --> 00:04:06.282
to the philosophy of the design world.

00:04:06.306 --> 00:04:09.327
The students are encouraged
to engage with communities

00:04:09.351 --> 00:04:12.594
as they search for solutions
to health-related problems.

00:04:13.055 --> 00:04:16.324
One of the communities that we work with
is a group of elderly people

00:04:16.348 --> 00:04:17.572
in Cape Town.

00:04:17.596 --> 00:04:21.736
A recent class project had the task
of addressing hearing loss

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.210
in these elderly people.

00:04:23.886 --> 00:04:26.658
The students, many of them
being engineers,

00:04:26.682 --> 00:04:31.533
set out believing that they
would design a better hearing aid.

00:04:31.557 --> 00:04:33.165
They spent time with the elderly,

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.437
chatted to their healthcare providers
and their caregivers.

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:42.153
They soon realized that, actually,
adequate hearing aids already existed,

00:04:42.177 --> 00:04:46.173
but many of the elderly who needed them
and had access to them

00:04:46.197 --> 00:04:47.610
didn't have them.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.066
And many of those who had hearing aids

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.323
wouldn't wear them.

00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:54.311
The students realized

00:04:54.335 --> 00:04:58.272
that many of these elderly people
were in denial of their hearing loss.

00:04:58.296 --> 00:05:00.796
There's a stigma attached
to wearing a hearing aid.

00:05:01.757 --> 00:05:06.515
They also discovered that the environment
in which these elderly people lived

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.562
did not accommodate their hearing loss.

00:05:08.586 --> 00:05:12.367
For example, their homes
and their community center

00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:15.459
were filled with echoes
that interfered with their hearing.

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:21.107
So instead of developing and designing
a new and better hearing aid,

00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:23.814
the students did an audit
of the environment,

00:05:23.838 --> 00:05:26.237
with a view to improving the acoustics.

00:05:27.196 --> 00:05:31.030
They also devised a campaign
to raise awareness of hearing loss

00:05:31.054 --> 00:05:34.630
and to counter the stigma
attached to wearing a hearing aid.

00:05:35.603 --> 00:05:38.987
Now, this often happens
when one pays attention to the user --

00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:40.661
in this case, the elderly --

00:05:40.685 --> 00:05:42.650
and their needs and their context.

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:46.065
One often has to move away
from the focus of technology

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:47.927
and reformulate the problem.

00:05:48.861 --> 00:05:52.838
This approach to understanding a problem
through listening and engaging

00:05:52.862 --> 00:05:54.090
is not new,

00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:57.213
but it often isn't followed by engineers,

00:05:57.237 --> 00:06:00.347
who are intent on developing technology.

00:06:01.704 --> 00:06:05.152
One of our students has a background
in software engineering.

00:06:05.176 --> 00:06:07.853
He had often created products for clients

00:06:07.877 --> 00:06:10.266
that the client ultimately did not like.

00:06:10.902 --> 00:06:13.079
When a client would reject a product,

00:06:13.103 --> 00:06:14.988
it was common at his company

00:06:15.012 --> 00:06:18.720
to proclaim that the client
just didn't know what they wanted.

00:06:19.384 --> 00:06:22.946
Having completed the course,
the student fed back to us

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.168
that he now realized
that it was he who hadn't understood

00:06:26.192 --> 00:06:27.613
what the client wanted.

00:06:28.254 --> 00:06:30.827
Another student gave us feedback

00:06:30.851 --> 00:06:33.319
that she had learned
to design with empathy,

00:06:33.343 --> 00:06:36.333
as opposed to designing for functionality,

00:06:36.357 --> 00:06:39.088
which is what her engineering
education had taught her.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.962
So what all of this illustrates is that
we're often blinded to real needs

00:06:43.986 --> 00:06:45.579
in our pursuit of technology.

00:06:45.936 --> 00:06:47.517
But we need technology.

00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:50.510
We need hearing aids.
We need fetal heart rate monitors.

00:06:51.385 --> 00:06:56.168
So how do we create more medical device
success stories from Africa?

00:06:56.967 --> 00:06:58.945
How do we create more inventors,

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:02.216
rather than relying on
a few exceptional individuals

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.348
who are able to perceive real needs

00:07:04.372 --> 00:07:06.214
and respond in ways that work?

00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:10.178
Well, we focus on needs
and people and context.

00:07:10.497 --> 00:07:12.329
"But this is obvious," you might say,

00:07:12.353 --> 00:07:14.631
"Of course context is important."

00:07:15.486 --> 00:07:17.894
But Africa is a diverse continent,

00:07:17.918 --> 00:07:22.789
with vast disparities in health and wealth
and income and education.

00:07:22.813 --> 00:07:27.840
If we assume that our engineers
and inventors already know enough

00:07:27.864 --> 00:07:30.450
about the different African contexts

00:07:30.474 --> 00:07:34.315
to be able to solve the problems
of our different communities

00:07:34.339 --> 00:07:36.278
and our most marginalized communities,

00:07:36.302 --> 00:07:37.750
then we might get it wrong.

00:07:38.907 --> 00:07:41.502
But then, if we on the African continent

00:07:41.526 --> 00:07:44.798
don't necessarily know enough about it,

00:07:44.822 --> 00:07:48.952
then perhaps anybody with the right level
of skill and commitment could fly in,

00:07:48.976 --> 00:07:51.445
spend some time listening and engaging

00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:54.726
and fly out knowing enough
to invent for Africa.

00:07:55.953 --> 00:08:00.268
But understanding context is not about
a superficial interaction.

00:08:00.292 --> 00:08:02.252
It's about deep engagement

00:08:02.276 --> 00:08:06.914
and an immersion in the realities
and the complexities of our context.

00:08:07.877 --> 00:08:11.019
And we in Africa are already immersed.

00:08:11.522 --> 00:08:15.195
We already have a strong and rich
base of knowledge

00:08:15.219 --> 00:08:18.897
from which to start finding solutions
to our own problems.

00:08:19.873 --> 00:08:22.889
So let's not rely too much on others

00:08:23.548 --> 00:08:27.642
when we live on a continent
that is filled with untapped talent.

00:08:28.124 --> 00:08:29.310
Thank you.

00:08:29.334 --> 00:08:32.305
(Applause)
