00:00:13.928 --> 00:00:17.993
So ... we're in a real live war
at the moment,

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:20.431
and it's a war that we're truly losing.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.815
It's a war on superbugs.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:27.523
So you might wonder,

00:00:27.547 --> 00:00:29.605
if I'm going to talk about superbugs,

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:33.861
why I'm showing you a photograph
of some soccer fans --

00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:37.106
Liverpool soccer fans
celebrating a famous victory

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.232
in Istanbul, a decade ago.

00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:42.393
In the back, in the red shirt,

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:44.004
well, that's me,

00:00:44.028 --> 00:00:48.559
and next to me in the red hat,
that's my friend Paul Rice.

00:00:49.168 --> 00:00:52.590
So a couple of years
after this picture was taken,

00:00:52.614 --> 00:00:56.451
Paul went into hospital
for some minor surgery,

00:00:56.475 --> 00:01:00.748
and he developed
a superbug-related infection,

00:01:00.772 --> 00:01:02.076
and he died.

00:01:02.425 --> 00:01:05.174
And I was truly shocked.

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:07.612
He was a healthy guy in the prime of life.

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:09.904
So there and then,

00:01:09.928 --> 00:01:13.484
and actually with a lot of encouragement
from a couple of TEDsters,

00:01:13.508 --> 00:01:16.719
I declared my own
personal war on superbugs.

00:01:18.365 --> 00:01:20.711
So let's talk about superbugs
for a moment.

00:01:20.735 --> 00:01:24.119
The story actually starts in the 1940s

00:01:24.143 --> 00:01:27.214
with the widespread
introduction of antibiotics.

00:01:27.925 --> 00:01:29.324
And since then,

00:01:29.348 --> 00:01:33.884
drug-resistant bacteria
have continued to emerge,

00:01:33.908 --> 00:01:37.329
and so we've been forced to develop
newer and newer drugs

00:01:37.353 --> 00:01:39.225
to fight these new bacteria.

00:01:40.061 --> 00:01:45.956
And this vicious cycle
actually is the origin of superbugs,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.414
which is simply bacteria
for which we don't have effective drugs.

00:01:51.474 --> 00:01:55.028
I'm sure you'll recognize
at least some of these superbugs.

00:01:55.052 --> 00:01:57.416
These are the more
common ones around today.

00:01:58.158 --> 00:02:02.605
Last year, around 700,000 people died

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:05.369
from superbug-related diseases.

00:02:05.983 --> 00:02:09.292
Looking to the future,

00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:12.452
if we carry on on the path we're going,

00:02:12.476 --> 00:02:16.102
which is basically a drugs-based
approach to the problem,

00:02:16.126 --> 00:02:18.722
the best estimate
by the middle of this century

00:02:18.746 --> 00:02:23.596
is that the worldwide death toll
from superbugs will be 10 million.

00:02:24.126 --> 00:02:25.563
10 million.

00:02:25.947 --> 00:02:28.758
Just to put that in context,
that's actually more

00:02:28.782 --> 00:02:32.317
than the number of people
that died of cancer worldwide last year.

00:02:32.954 --> 00:02:37.010
So it seems pretty clear
that we're not on a good road,

00:02:37.034 --> 00:02:40.947
and the drugs-based approach
to this problem is not working.

00:02:42.247 --> 00:02:44.708
I'm a physicist,

00:02:44.732 --> 00:02:48.669
and so I wondered, could we take
a physics-based approach --

00:02:48.693 --> 00:02:50.584
a different approach to this problem.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.122
And in that context,

00:02:53.146 --> 00:02:55.797
the first thing we know for sure,

00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:59.154
is that we actually know how to kill
every kind of microbe,

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:00.767
every kind of virus,

00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:02.422
every kind of bacteria.

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:05.037
And that's with ultraviolet light.

00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:08.326
We've actually known this
for more than 100 years.

00:03:08.933 --> 00:03:11.569
I think you all know
what ultraviolet light is.

00:03:11.593 --> 00:03:14.632
It's part of a spectrum
that includes infrared,

00:03:14.656 --> 00:03:16.102
it includes visible light,

00:03:16.126 --> 00:03:20.058
and the short-wavelength part
of this group is ultraviolet light.

00:03:21.607 --> 00:03:24.696
The key thing from our perspective here

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.908
is that ultraviolet light kills bacteria
by a completely different mechanism

00:03:29.932 --> 00:03:31.805
from the way drugs kill bacteria.

00:03:32.605 --> 00:03:38.393
So ultraviolet light is just as capable
of killing a drug-resistant bacteria

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:40.641
as any other bacteria,

00:03:40.665 --> 00:03:45.143
and because ultraviolet light
is so good at killing all bugs,

00:03:45.167 --> 00:03:48.302
it's actually used a lot these days
to sterilize rooms,

00:03:48.326 --> 00:03:51.374
sterilize working surfaces.

00:03:51.398 --> 00:03:54.226
What you see here is a surgical theater

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.581
being sterilized with germicidal
ultraviolet light.

00:03:59.578 --> 00:04:02.055
But what you don't see
in this picture, actually,

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.744
is any people,

00:04:03.768 --> 00:04:06.004
and there's a very good reason for that.

00:04:06.028 --> 00:04:09.615
Ultraviolet light
is actually a health hazard,

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.964
so it can damage cells in our skin,

00:04:11.988 --> 00:04:13.419
cause skin cancer,

00:04:13.443 --> 00:04:14.954
it can damage cells in our eye,

00:04:14.978 --> 00:04:18.466
cause eye diseases like cataract.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.945
So you can't use conventional,
germicidal, ultraviolet light

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:23.698
when there are people are around.

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:24.937
And of course,

00:04:24.961 --> 00:04:27.991
we want to sterilize mostly
when there are people around.

00:04:28.929 --> 00:04:31.596
So the ideal ultraviolet light

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.303
would actually be able
to kill all bacteria,

00:04:35.327 --> 00:04:36.863
including superbugs,

00:04:36.887 --> 00:04:39.401
but would be safe for human exposure.

00:04:40.312 --> 00:04:44.559
And actually that's where my physics
background kicked into this story.

00:04:45.296 --> 00:04:47.488
Together with my physics colleagues,

00:04:47.512 --> 00:04:53.587
we realized there actually is a particular
wavelength of ultraviolet light

00:04:53.611 --> 00:04:56.104
that should kill all bacteria,

00:04:56.128 --> 00:04:58.288
but should be safe for human exposure.

00:04:58.928 --> 00:05:02.246
That wavelength is called far-UVC light,

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.564
and it's just the short-wavelength part
of the ultraviolet spectrum.

00:05:07.375 --> 00:05:09.506
So let's see how that would work.

00:05:10.426 --> 00:05:14.235
What you're seeing here
is the surface of our skin,

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:18.602
and I'm going to superimpose on that
some bacteria in the air above the skin.

00:05:19.536 --> 00:05:21.203
Now we're going to see what happens

00:05:21.227 --> 00:05:26.370
when conventional, germicidal,
ultraviolet light impinges on this.

00:05:27.631 --> 00:05:28.781
So what you see is,

00:05:28.805 --> 00:05:34.091
as we know, germicidal light
is really good at killing bacteria,

00:05:34.115 --> 00:05:35.425
but what you also see

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:38.792
is that it penetrates
into the upper layers of our skin,

00:05:38.816 --> 00:05:41.368
and it can damage
those key cells in our skin

00:05:41.392 --> 00:05:44.597
which ultimately, when damaged,
can lead to skin cancer.

00:05:46.108 --> 00:05:48.956
So let's compare now with far-UVC light --

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.140
same situation,

00:05:50.164 --> 00:05:52.646
skin and some bacteria
in the air above them.

00:05:54.342 --> 00:05:55.594
So what you're seeing now

00:05:55.618 --> 00:06:00.414
is that again, far-UVC light's
perfectly fine at killing bacteria,

00:06:00.438 --> 00:06:04.525
but what far-UVC light can't do
is penetrate into our skin.

00:06:05.318 --> 00:06:08.033
And there's a good,
solid physics reason for that:

00:06:08.057 --> 00:06:13.421
far-UVC light is incredibly, strongly
absorbed by all biological materials,

00:06:13.445 --> 00:06:15.357
so it simply can't go very far.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.637
Now, viruses and bacteria
are really, really, really small,

00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:25.527
so the far-UVC light can certainly
penetrate them and kill them,

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:28.935
but what it can't do
is penetrate into skin,

00:06:28.959 --> 00:06:31.361
and it can't even penetrate
the dead-cell area

00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:33.207
right at the very surface of our skin.

00:06:33.815 --> 00:06:40.137
So far-UVC light
should be able to kill bacteria,

00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:41.431
but kill them safely.

00:06:43.397 --> 00:06:44.563
So that's the theory.

00:06:44.587 --> 00:06:47.299
It should work, should be safe.

00:06:47.921 --> 00:06:49.516
What about in practice?

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.691
Does it really work?

00:06:50.715 --> 00:06:52.093
Is it really safe?

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:55.005
So that's actually what our lab
has been working on

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:57.246
the past five or six years,

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:00.119
and I'm delighted to say the answer
to both these questions

00:07:00.143 --> 00:07:01.324
is an emphatic yes.

00:07:01.348 --> 00:07:02.628
Yes, it does work,

00:07:02.652 --> 00:07:04.031
but yes, it is safe.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.233
So I'm delighted to say that,

00:07:06.257 --> 00:07:08.496
but actually I'm not very
surprised to say that,

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.791
because it's purely the laws
of physics at work.

00:07:13.911 --> 00:07:16.046
So let's look to the future.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:21.828
I'm thrilled that we now have
a completely new weapon,

00:07:21.852 --> 00:07:25.316
and I should say an inexpensive weapon,

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.839
in our fight against superbugs.

00:07:28.447 --> 00:07:29.695
For example,

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:32.555
I see far-UVC lights in surgical theaters.

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:36.958
I see far-UVC lights
in food preparation areas.

00:07:38.046 --> 00:07:40.906
And in terms of preventing
the spread of viruses,

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.102
I see far-UVC lights in schools,

00:07:44.126 --> 00:07:46.649
preventing the spread of influenza,

00:07:46.673 --> 00:07:48.638
preventing the spread of measles,

00:07:48.662 --> 00:07:52.642
and I see far-UVC lights
in airports or airplanes,

00:07:52.666 --> 00:07:56.794
preventing the global spread
of viruses like H1N1 virus.

00:07:58.015 --> 00:08:00.182
So back to my friend Paul Rice.

00:08:00.206 --> 00:08:04.101
He was actually a well-known
and well-loved local politician

00:08:04.125 --> 00:08:06.797
in his and my hometown of Liverpool,

00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:11.025
and they put up a statue in his memory
in the center of Liverpool,

00:08:11.049 --> 00:08:12.344
and there it is.

00:08:12.368 --> 00:08:14.558
But me,

00:08:14.582 --> 00:08:19.317
I want Paul's legacy to be a major advance
in this war against superbugs.

00:08:20.002 --> 00:08:22.067
Armed with the power of light,

00:08:22.091 --> 00:08:24.129
that's actually within our grasp.

00:08:25.297 --> 00:08:26.448
Thank you.

00:08:26.472 --> 00:08:31.368
(Applause)

00:08:31.392 --> 00:08:34.511
Chris Anderson: Stay up here, David,
I've got a question for you.

00:08:34.535 --> 00:08:35.948
(Applause)

00:08:37.343 --> 00:08:41.928
David, tell us where you're up to
in developing this,

00:08:41.952 --> 00:08:44.899
and what are the remaining obstacles
to trying to roll out

00:08:44.923 --> 00:08:46.303
and realize this dream?

00:08:46.678 --> 00:08:49.869
David Brenner: Well, I think we now know
that it kills all bacteria,

00:08:49.893 --> 00:08:51.948
but we sort of knew
that before we started,

00:08:51.972 --> 00:08:54.150
but we certainly tested that.

00:08:54.174 --> 00:08:56.888
So we have to do lots and lots
of tests about safety,

00:08:56.912 --> 00:09:00.435
and so it's more about safety
than it is about efficacy.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.244
And we need to do short-term tests,

00:09:03.268 --> 00:09:05.271
and we need to do long-term tests

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:09.178
to make sure you can't develop
melanoma many years on.

00:09:09.494 --> 00:09:13.374
So those studies
are pretty well done at this point.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:19.232
The FDA of course is something
we have to deal with,

00:09:19.256 --> 00:09:20.631
and rightly so,

00:09:20.655 --> 00:09:24.345
because we certainly can't use this
in the real world without FDA approval.

00:09:24.766 --> 00:09:27.964
CA: Are you trying
to launch first in the US,

00:09:27.988 --> 00:09:29.367
or somewhere else?

00:09:29.772 --> 00:09:31.924
DB: Actually, in a couple of countries.

00:09:31.948 --> 00:09:35.384
In Japan and in the US, both.

00:09:35.873 --> 00:09:40.478
CA: Have you been able to persuade
biologists, doctors,

00:09:40.502 --> 00:09:42.152
that this is a safe approach?

00:09:42.612 --> 00:09:45.707
DB: Well, as you can imagine,
there is a certain skepticism

00:09:45.731 --> 00:09:49.299
because everybody knows
that UV light is not safe.

00:09:49.691 --> 00:09:51.676
So when somebody comes along and says,

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.036
"Well, this particular UV light is safe,"

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.702
there is a barrier to be crossed,

00:09:56.726 --> 00:09:58.916
but the data are there,

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.631
and I think that's what
we're going to be standing on.

00:10:02.487 --> 00:10:04.177
CA: Well, we wish you well.

00:10:04.201 --> 00:10:06.106
This is potentially such important work.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.163
Thank you so much
for sharing this with us.

00:10:08.187 --> 00:10:09.338
Thank you, David.

00:10:09.362 --> 00:10:12.563
(Applause)
