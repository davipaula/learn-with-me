00:00:17.422 --> 00:00:21.552
If you've ever had the suspicion
that your vote doesn't really count

00:00:21.552 --> 00:00:25.509
and the deck might be stacked
against you, you might be right.

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.070
In many places in this country,
we don't have a functioning democracy.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.225
People might go to the polls,

00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:35.185
but they might not have a real choice
when they get there.

00:00:35.787 --> 00:00:39.737
In 2010, the people of Florida
were trying to do something about this.

00:00:39.737 --> 00:00:43.258
They passed a ballot initiative
with almost two-thirds of the vote:

00:00:43.258 --> 00:00:45.478
a new state constitutional amendment

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:50.788
requiring that districts be fair
and not biased based on race or party.

00:00:51.672 --> 00:00:52.702
It didn't work.

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:57.784
The state legislature sued to try
and get out of these new requirements,

00:00:57.784 --> 00:00:59.834
and in subsequent court battles,

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.430
the maps they made were found
to be racially and partisan biased.

00:01:06.907 --> 00:01:08.896
Florida is just one example

00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:11.216
of our national problem
with gerrymandering.

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:15.109
Gerrymandering is when you
take a few people from one place

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:19.149
and a few people from another place
and draw a line around them on the map

00:01:19.587 --> 00:01:23.027
to create a district
with some specific demographic goal.

00:01:24.722 --> 00:01:27.392
Here's an example world with 25 people:

00:01:27.982 --> 00:01:31.862
60% green people and 40% purple people.

00:01:32.533 --> 00:01:36.506
If you split that up into five simple
districts of five people each,

00:01:36.506 --> 00:01:39.223
you can preserve that ratio in the outcome

00:01:39.223 --> 00:01:41.639
and have three districts
won by green people

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:43.889
and two districts won by purple people.

00:01:44.744 --> 00:01:48.814
But if you pack enough green people
into just two districts,

00:01:49.144 --> 00:01:51.014
then you can flip that outcome

00:01:51.014 --> 00:01:54.704
and wind up with three districts
where there's a purple majority.

00:01:55.762 --> 00:02:00.609
Or you can crack the purple people
and split them up just right

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:03.299
so that they don't have
a majority anywhere.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.812
These strategies of packing and cracking

00:02:06.812 --> 00:02:10.582
are being used in dozens of districts
throughout the country.

00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:15.217
That bright blue district
in northeast Florida

00:02:15.737 --> 00:02:17.945
was found to be racially biased

00:02:17.945 --> 00:02:21.977
because it packs too many
black people into one district,

00:02:21.977 --> 00:02:23.807
diminishing their influence elsewhere.

00:02:25.042 --> 00:02:27.845
That was Florida in 2012,

00:02:28.195 --> 00:02:31.088
but gerrymandering
has been going on for a long time,

00:02:31.088 --> 00:02:33.086
since at least 1812,

00:02:33.496 --> 00:02:37.539
when Massachusetts governor Elbridge Gerry
signed into law a map

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:43.089
that was drawn into a political cartoon
as a monstrous, dragonesque salamander,

00:02:43.484 --> 00:02:45.564
and thus was born the gerrymander.

00:02:46.327 --> 00:02:48.387
But it's gotten a lot worse lately.

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:52.234
The joke is that instead of voters
picking their politicians,

00:02:52.234 --> 00:02:54.494
politicians are picking their voters.

00:02:55.982 --> 00:02:57.252
Why is this a problem?

00:02:57.765 --> 00:02:59.314
When you have too many seats

00:02:59.314 --> 00:03:02.807
that are gerrymandered
to be safe for one party or another,

00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:05.587
the political process
breaks down in some ways.

00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:08.515
I have one personal example.

00:03:08.515 --> 00:03:11.279
In 2006, I was a webmaster

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:13.689
for a congressional campaign
in California.

00:03:14.232 --> 00:03:15.344
We were in a district

00:03:15.344 --> 00:03:18.664
that was gerrymandered,
say, for the other party.

00:03:19.346 --> 00:03:22.502
And the incumbent in that party

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:25.492
didn't feel the need
to take part in the campaign

00:03:25.492 --> 00:03:27.845
and wouldn't agree
to show up for any debates.

00:03:27.845 --> 00:03:29.525
He just felt he didn't have to.

00:03:30.027 --> 00:03:34.967
And our party wouldn't send any help;
they figured we were a lost cause.

00:03:35.522 --> 00:03:39.772
Come election day, the incumbent
got the expected 60/40 result.

00:03:41.102 --> 00:03:43.072
In other places, it's even worse.

00:03:43.366 --> 00:03:48.287
In 2014, there were 32 congressional
districts that went unopposed -

00:03:48.287 --> 00:03:49.797
no one else on the ballot.

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.143
That's over 20 million Americans

00:03:52.143 --> 00:03:56.423
with no effective choice over
who their representative in Congress is.

00:03:58.143 --> 00:03:59.395
In some places,

00:03:59.745 --> 00:04:03.755
the incumbent faces a more extreme
challenger from within their own party.

00:04:04.053 --> 00:04:09.203
And whether you have an extremist upstart
or a long incumbent safe seat,

00:04:10.647 --> 00:04:14.627
that politician might not feel the need
to reach out across the aisle

00:04:14.627 --> 00:04:17.337
and compromise on anything
because they're safe,

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.123
and the legislative process
grinds to a halt,

00:04:21.123 --> 00:04:22.793
and voters get more cynical.

00:04:23.772 --> 00:04:26.472
What if we could have impartial districts?

00:04:26.856 --> 00:04:30.406
What if we defined what a good
district was mathematically

00:04:30.406 --> 00:04:33.327
and didn't let anyone else's
agenda interfere?

00:04:34.485 --> 00:04:37.885
Florida's map might look
something like this.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.019
About 10 years ago,

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:44.272
computers got powerful enough
to solve for this kind of map

00:04:44.472 --> 00:04:50.582
that follows the legal requirements
of having equal population per district,

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.011
contiguous districts
that are each all one piece,

00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:57.540
and in this case,
solving for compact districts

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.490
that try to tightly represent
one location or region.

00:05:04.215 --> 00:05:06.725
But I didn't know
it would work when I started.

00:05:06.725 --> 00:05:08.063
Previous work in this area

00:05:08.063 --> 00:05:11.446
had been on tiny toy maps
like the one I showed you earlier,

00:05:11.446 --> 00:05:15.236
and they didn't think it would scale up
to a full state worth of data.

00:05:15.436 --> 00:05:18.596
But I figured I was a pretty good engineer
and I'd give it a shot,

00:05:18.596 --> 00:05:20.662
and I think it worked out pretty well.

00:05:20.912 --> 00:05:24.668
So, when the 2010 census data
starting coming out,

00:05:24.668 --> 00:05:26.632
I set my home computer to work,

00:05:26.632 --> 00:05:31.582
and over the next six months,
it came up with 137 maps

00:05:31.582 --> 00:05:34.451
for state legislature
and congressional districts

00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:35.641
all over the country.

00:05:36.014 --> 00:05:38.104
And I think the results are pretty good.

00:05:38.316 --> 00:05:39.576
Let's see another one.

00:05:39.593 --> 00:05:40.913
First, the old way.

00:05:42.473 --> 00:05:47.013
North Carolina has also been
in almost constant legal battles

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.948
since their maps came out
a little over four years ago.

00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:51.978
Most recently,

00:05:51.978 --> 00:05:56.558
they were thrown out for racial bias
just as primary season was spinning up.

00:05:57.178 --> 00:05:59.214
New maps were hastily drawn up,

00:05:59.214 --> 00:06:02.714
and the primary had to be pushed back
from March until June.

00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:05.921
Voters and candidates
were left in disarray.

00:06:07.272 --> 00:06:09.492
That red district in the northeast

00:06:09.492 --> 00:06:12.572
reaches into and around
three other districts.

00:06:13.544 --> 00:06:17.782
That pink district in the middle
pinches down as narrow as possible

00:06:17.782 --> 00:06:20.132
while reaching out to grab other areas.

00:06:20.696 --> 00:06:21.716
This is nuts.

00:06:22.487 --> 00:06:24.712
These are the visual telltales

00:06:24.712 --> 00:06:28.602
of districts that have been distorted
toward some political end.

00:06:29.634 --> 00:06:34.834
The opposite of a sprawling,
non-local gerrymandered map

00:06:34.834 --> 00:06:37.928
is a compact map, like this.

00:06:39.047 --> 00:06:40.917
I hope you can see the difference.

00:06:41.565 --> 00:06:43.025
You can also measure it.

00:06:43.597 --> 00:06:44.805
I measure compactness

00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:48.565
as the average distance per person
to the center of their district.

00:06:49.355 --> 00:06:53.105
In the old North Carolina map,
that distance was 38 miles;

00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:56.349
in my map, it's 25 miles.

00:06:57.015 --> 00:07:01.305
You can measure how sprawling
and non-local a gerrymandered map is

00:07:01.305 --> 00:07:03.818
and how compact a compact map is.

00:07:05.323 --> 00:07:07.463
So, it's technically possible.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.670
How's the political situation?

00:07:09.901 --> 00:07:13.491
You might expect that there would be
some resistance to this kind of change,

00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:16.321
and there is, but there is
also some demand for it.

00:07:17.622 --> 00:07:22.282
The republican governor of Maryland
has recently called out for national help

00:07:22.282 --> 00:07:25.370
in overturning his state's
democratic gerrymander.

00:07:26.666 --> 00:07:29.430
That is one of the more contorted messes

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:34.230
of tentacled horrors of districts
I have seen in any map.

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.320
(Laughter)

00:07:37.064 --> 00:07:39.164
I don't know if this is the best map,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.895
but I submit that it is
a legally viable map,

00:07:42.895 --> 00:07:46.925
without some of the obvious runaround
and drawbacks of the old map.

00:07:49.083 --> 00:07:52.154
There are a lot of states
with divided government,

00:07:52.154 --> 00:07:54.784
with the two parties
fighting over redistricting.

00:07:55.168 --> 00:07:57.678
But this shouldn't be
something to fight about.

00:07:57.687 --> 00:08:01.647
Redistricting should be
a bureaucratic, boring process,

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:04.943
where you get in new census data,
you turn the crank,

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:07.483
and you get out new maps
for the next 10 years.

00:08:10.272 --> 00:08:11.889
In the last few years,

00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:17.579
California, Arizona, Ohio, and Florida
have passed reform of one kind or another.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.870
That shows that it's possible.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.857
Those reforms might not be perfect,
and they might still need some tinkering,

00:08:23.857 --> 00:08:24.937
but we can do it.

00:08:26.635 --> 00:08:28.325
This is technically possible.

00:08:29.102 --> 00:08:32.202
Open-source software, free and verifiable,

00:08:33.691 --> 00:08:36.451
running on home computers
that anyone can use

00:08:36.878 --> 00:08:39.291
can solve for these kinds
of impartial maps,

00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:41.171
and the results are pretty good.

00:08:41.616 --> 00:08:43.666
This is politically possible.

00:08:43.666 --> 00:08:47.083
People want reform -
even some elected officials want it.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.220
And the legal mechanisms are achievable.

00:08:50.932 --> 00:08:52.911
If we could have a change now,

00:08:52.911 --> 00:08:56.491
we could have a big effect
on the future of our political process.

00:08:57.139 --> 00:08:59.579
If reform comes to enough places,

00:08:59.579 --> 00:09:00.899
enough states,

00:09:00.899 --> 00:09:03.959
we might even be able
to get a national standard.

00:09:04.805 --> 00:09:09.925
And a national standard might let us
really hold up our core value

00:09:09.925 --> 00:09:13.063
of equal protection under the law for all.

00:09:13.063 --> 00:09:14.083
(Applause)
