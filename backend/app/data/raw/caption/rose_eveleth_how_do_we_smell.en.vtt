00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.664
It's the first sense you use
when you're born.

00:00:09.688 --> 00:00:12.855
One out of every fifty of your genes
is dedicated to it.

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.585
It must be important, right?

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.226
Okay, take a deep breath
through your nose.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.759
It's your sense of smell,

00:00:18.783 --> 00:00:20.679
and it's breathtakingly powerful.

00:00:20.703 --> 00:00:24.223
As an adult, you can distinguish
about 10,000 different smells.

00:00:24.247 --> 00:00:25.733
Here's how your nose does it.

00:00:25.757 --> 00:00:29.119
Smell starts when you sniff molecules
from the air into your nostrils.

00:00:29.143 --> 00:00:30.822
95% of your nasal cavity

00:00:30.846 --> 00:00:33.981
is used just to filter that air
before it hits your lungs.

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:35.577
But at the very back of your nose

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:37.956
is a region called
the olfactory epithelium,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.695
a little patch of skin
that's key to everything you smell.

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:43.917
The olfactory epithelium has
a layer of olfactory receptor cells,

00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:45.837
special neurons that sense smells,

00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:47.690
like the taste buds of your nose.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.857
When odor molecules hit
the back of your nose,

00:00:49.881 --> 00:00:53.262
they get stuck in a layer of mucus
covering the olfactory epithelium.

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:56.096
As they dissolve, they bind
to the olfactory receptor cells,

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.764
which fire and send signals
through the olfactory tract

00:00:58.788 --> 00:00:59.918
up to your brain.

00:00:59.942 --> 00:01:01.601
As a side note, you can tell a lot

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:03.687
about how good
an animal's sense of smell is

00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:05.726
by the size of its olfactory epithelium.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.085
A dog's olfactory epithelium

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:09.479
is 20 times bigger
than your puny human one.

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:13.075
But there's still a lot we don't know
about this little patch of cells, too.

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:15.494
For example, our olfactory
epithelium is pigmented,

00:01:15.518 --> 00:01:17.669
and scientists don't really know why.

00:01:17.693 --> 00:01:20.556
But how do you actually tell
the difference between smells?

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.105
It turns out that your brain has

00:01:22.129 --> 00:01:24.538
40 million different
olfactory receptor neurons,

00:01:24.562 --> 00:01:27.038
so odor A might trigger

00:01:27.062 --> 00:01:29.834
neurons 3, 427, and 988,

00:01:29.858 --> 00:01:32.096
and odor B might trigger

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.285
neurons 8, 76, and 2,496,678.

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:37.976
All of these different combinations

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.437
let you detect a staggeringly
broad array of smells.

00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:43.172
Olfactory neurons are always fresh
and ready for action.

00:01:43.196 --> 00:01:46.272
They're the only neuron in the body
that gets replaced regularly,

00:01:46.296 --> 00:01:47.626
every four to eight weeks.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.496
Once they are triggered,
the signal travels through a bundle

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.774
called the olfactory tract

00:01:51.798 --> 00:01:54.916
to destinations all over your brain,
making stops in the amygdala,

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.486
the thalamus, and the neocortex.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.196
This is different from how sight
and sound are processed.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.566
Each of those signals goes first
to a relay center

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.496
in the middle of the cerebral hemisphere

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.536
and then out to other
regions of the brain.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.576
But smell, because it evolved
before most of your other senses,

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.486
takes a direct route
to these different regions of the brain,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.971
where it can trigger
your fight-or-flight response,

00:02:13.995 --> 00:02:16.475
help you recall memories,
or make your mouth water.

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.410
But even though we've all got
the same physiological set-up,

00:02:19.434 --> 00:02:21.629
two nostrils and millions
of olfactory neurons,

00:02:21.653 --> 00:02:23.434
not everybody smells the same things.

00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:25.336
One of the most famous examples of this

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.805
is the ability to smell
so-called "asparagus pee."

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.639
For about a quarter of the population,

00:02:29.663 --> 00:02:31.226
urinating after eating asparagus

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.082
means smelling a distinct odor.

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:35.578
The other 75% of us don't notice.

00:02:35.602 --> 00:02:38.862
And this isn't the only case
of smells differing from nose to nose.

00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:41.909
For some people, the chemical
androstenone smells like vanilla;

00:02:41.933 --> 00:02:44.082
to others, it smells like sweaty urine,

00:02:44.106 --> 00:02:45.130
which is unfortunate

00:02:45.154 --> 00:02:48.566
because androstenone is commonly found
in tasty things like pork.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.718
So with the sweaty urine smellers in mind,

00:02:50.742 --> 00:02:52.959
pork producers will castrate male pigs

00:02:52.983 --> 00:02:55.021
to stop them from making androstenone.

00:02:55.045 --> 00:02:57.791
The inability to smell a scent
is called anosmia,

00:02:57.815 --> 00:02:59.759
and there are about 100 known examples.

00:02:59.783 --> 00:03:03.050
People with allicin anosmia
can't smell garlic.

00:03:03.074 --> 00:03:05.923
Those with eugenol anosmia
can't smell cloves.

00:03:05.947 --> 00:03:08.523
And some people can't smell anything

00:03:08.547 --> 00:03:09.727
at all.

00:03:09.751 --> 00:03:12.279
This kind of full anosmia
could have several causes.

00:03:12.303 --> 00:03:14.494
Some people are born
without a sense of smell.

00:03:14.518 --> 00:03:17.531
Others lose it after an accident
or during an illness.

00:03:17.555 --> 00:03:20.068
If the olfactory epithelium
gets swollen or infected,

00:03:20.092 --> 00:03:21.712
it can hamper your sense of smell,

00:03:21.736 --> 00:03:24.451
something you might have experienced
when you were sick.

00:03:24.475 --> 00:03:27.774
Not being able to smell anything
can mess with your other senses, too.

00:03:27.798 --> 00:03:29.425
Many people who can't smell at all

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:32.031
also can't really taste
the same way the rest of us do.

00:03:32.055 --> 00:03:35.921
It turns out that how something tastes
is closely related to how it smells.

00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:38.836
As you chew your food,
air is pushed up your nasal passage,

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.845
carrying with it the smell of your food.

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:42.947
Those scents hit your olfactory epithelium

00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:45.357
and tell your brain a lot
about what you're eating.

00:03:45.381 --> 00:03:48.161
Without the ability to smell,
you lose the ability to taste

00:03:48.185 --> 00:03:50.346
anything more complicated
than the five tastes

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.965
your taste buds can detect:

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.457
sweet, salty,

00:03:53.481 --> 00:03:55.206
bitter, sour, and savory.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.230
So, the next time you smell exhaust fumes,

00:03:57.254 --> 00:03:58.948
salty sea air, or roast chicken,

00:03:58.972 --> 00:04:00.890
you'll know exactly how you've done it

00:04:00.914 --> 00:04:03.917
and, perhaps, be a little more
thankful that you can.
