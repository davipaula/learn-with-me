00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.936
In 2013, I was an executive
at an international engineering firm

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.336
in San Francisco.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.936
It was my dream job.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.256
A culmination of all the skills
that I've acquired over the years:

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.296
storytelling, social impact,
behavior change.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.216
I was the head of marketing and culture

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.216
and I worked with the nation's
largest health care systems,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.336
using technology and culture change

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.056
to radically reduce
their energy and water use

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.256
and to improve their social impact.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.400
I was creating real change in the world.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.440
And it was the worst
professional experience of my life.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.536
I hit the glass ceiling hard.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.000
It hurt like hell.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.696
While there were bigger issues,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.696
most of what happened
were little behaviors and patterns

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.776
that slowly chipped away
at my ability to do my work well.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.896
They ate away at my confidence,
my leadership, my capacity to innovate.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.856
For example, my first
presentation at the company.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.536
I walk up to the front of the room

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.336
to give a presentation on the strategy
that I believe is right for the company.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.936
The one they hired me to create.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.456
And I look around the room
at my fellow executives.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.736
And I watch as they
pick up their cell phones

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.016
and look down at their laptops.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.976
They're not paying attention.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.496
As soon as I start to speak,
the interruptions begin

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.680
and people talk over me
again and again and again.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.016
Some of my ideas are flat out dismissed

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.280
and then brought up
by somebody else and championed.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.976
I was the only woman in that room.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.560
And I could have used an ally.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.416
Little behaviors and pattern like this,
every day, again and again,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.456
they wear you down.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.080
Pretty soon, my energy
was absolutely tapped.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.456
At a real low point, I read an article

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.936
about toxic workplace culture
and microaggressions.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.016
Microaggressions --
everyday slights, insults,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.376
negative verbal
and nonverbal communication,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.096
whether intentional or not,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.440
that impede your ability
to do your work well.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.256
That sounded familiar.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.976
I started to realize
that I wasn't failing.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.600
The culture around me was failing me.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.456
And I wasn't alone.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.096
Behaviors and patterns like this

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.496
every day affect underrepresented people
of all backgrounds in the workplace.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.736
And that has a real impact

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.016
on our colleagues, on our companies

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.640
and our collective capacity to innovate.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.736
So, in the tech industry,
we want quick solutions.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.976
But there is no magic wand
for correcting diversity and inclusion.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.136
Change happens one person at a time,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.240
one act at a time, one word at a time.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.216
We make a mistake
when we see diversity and inclusion

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.576
as that side project over there
the diversity people are working on,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.440
rather than this work inside all of us
that we need to do together.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.256
And that work begins

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.280
with unlearning what we know
about success and opportunity.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.336
We've been told our whole lives

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.616
that if we work hard,
that hard work pays off,

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.800
we'd get what we deserve,
we'd live our dream.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.256
But that isn't true for everyone.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.256
Some people have to work 10 times as hard

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.976
to get to the same place

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.536
due to many barriers
put in front of them by society.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.776
Your gender, your race, your ethnicity,

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.976
your religion, your disability,
your sexual orientation,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.216
your class, your geography,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.296
all of these can give you more
of fewer opportunities for success.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.656
And that's where allyship comes in.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.296
Allyship is about understanding
that imbalance in opportunity

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.680
and working to correct it.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.936
Allyship is really seeing
the person next to us.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.456
And the person missing,
who should be standing next to us.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.176
And first, just knowing
what they're going through.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.840
And then, helping them succeed
and thrive with us.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.816
When we work together to develop
more diverse and inclusive teams,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.760
data shows we will be more innovative,
more productive and more profitable.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.976
So, who is an ally?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.216
All of us.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.936
We can all be allies for each other.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.456
As a white, cisgendered woman
in the United States,

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.496
there are many ways I'm very privileged.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.616
And some ways I'm not.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.896
And I work hard every day

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.656
to be an ally for people
with less privilege than me.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.200
And I still need allies, too.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.456
In the tech industry,
like in many industries,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.656
there are many people
who are underrepresented,

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.600
or face barriers and discrimination.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.376
Women, people who are nonbinary --

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.496
so people who don't necessarily
identify as man or woman --

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.176
racial and ethnic minorities,

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.536
LGBTQIA, people
with disabilities, veterans,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.736
anybody over age 35.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.920
(Laughter)

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.496
We have a major bias toward youth
in the tech industry.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.736
And many others.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.976
There is always someone
with less privilege than you.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.600
On this stage, in this room.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.360
At your company, on your team,
in your city or town.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.936
So, people are allies
for different reasons.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.416
Find your reason.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.096
It could be for the business case,

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.776
because data shows
diverse and inclusive teams

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.336
will be more productive,
more profitable and more innovative.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.696
It could be for fairness
and social justice.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.696
Because we have a long history
of oppression and inequity

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.800
that we need to work on together.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.056
Or it could be for your kids,

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.656
so your kids grow up
with equal opportunities.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.600
And they grow up creating
equal opportunities for others.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.016
Find your reason.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.256
For me, it's all three.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.560
Find your reason and step up
to be there for someone who needs you.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.376
So, what can you do as an ally?

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.736
Start by doing no harm.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.816
It's our job as allies to know what
microaggressions are and to not do them.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.216
It's our job as allies
to listen, to learn,

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.896
to unlearn and to relearn,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.000
and to make mistakes and to keep learning.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.920
Give me your full attention.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.136
Close your laptops,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.680
put down your cellphones
and pay attention.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.456
If somebody is new or the only
person in the room like them,

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.736
or they're just nervous,

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.136
this is going to make a huge difference
in how they show up.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.376
Don't interrupt.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.136
Underrepresented people
are more likely to be interrupted,

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.976
so just take a step back and listen.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.016
Echo and attribute.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.776
If I have a great idea,

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.400
echo my idea and then attribute it to me,
and we thrive together.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.296
Learn the language I use
to describe my identity.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.336
Know how to pronounce my name.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.656
Know my pronouns -- he, she, they.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.960
Know the language I use to describe
my disability, my ethnicity, my religion.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.720
This really matters to people,
so if you don't know, just ask.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.960
Listen and learn.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.376
An executive told me recently
that after doing allyship on his team,

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.576
the whole team started to normalize
calling themselves out and each other out

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.800
for interrupting.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.696
"I'm so sorry I'm interrupting
you right now, carry on."

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.880
"Hey, she's got
a great idea, let's listen."

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.056
Number two, advocate
for underrepresented people in small ways.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.176
Intervene; you can change
the power dynamics in the room.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.736
If you see somebody is the only
person in the room like them

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.416
and they are being belittled,
they are being interrupted,

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.480
do something, say something.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.936
Invite underrepresented people to speak.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.600
And say no to panels
without underrepresented speakers.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.256
Refer someone for a job

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.336
and encourage them to take that job
and to take new opportunities.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.816
And this one's really important --
help normalize allyship.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.696
If you're a person with privilege,

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.416
it's easier for you
to advocate for allies.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.240
So use that privilege to create change.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.096
Three, change someone's
life significantly.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.176
So, be there for somebody
throughout their career.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.880
Mentor or sponsor them,
give them opportunities as they grow.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.936
Volunteer -- volunteer for a STEM program,
serving underserved youth.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.456
Transform your team
to be more diverse and inclusive.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.576
And make real commitments
to creating change here.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.960
Hold yourself and your team
accountable for creating change.

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.616
And lastly,

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.656
help advocate for change
across your company.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:41.056
When companies teach
their people to be allies,

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.976
diversity and inclusion
programs are stronger.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.135
You and I can be allies for each other,

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:48.520
whether we're inside or outside of work.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.799
So, I realized recently

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.816
that I still have lingering shame and fear

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.176
from that moment in my career
when I felt utterly alone,

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.880
shut out and unsupported.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.016
There are millions of people out there,
like me, right now, feeling that way.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.296
And it doesn't take much
for us to be there for each other.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.376
And when we're there for each other,
when we support one another,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.936
we thrive together.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.936
And when we thrive, we build better teams,

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.200
better products and better companies.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.760
Allyship is powerful.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.800
Try it.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.176
Thank you.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.480
(Applause)
