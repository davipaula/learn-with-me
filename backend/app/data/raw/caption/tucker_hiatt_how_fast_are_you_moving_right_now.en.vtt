00:00:08.996 --> 00:00:12.251
How fast are you moving right now?

00:00:12.251 --> 00:00:13.833
That seems like an easy question.

00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:15.200
The first tempting answer is,

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.868
"I'm not moving."

00:00:16.868 --> 00:00:18.173
Upon further reflection,

00:00:18.173 --> 00:00:21.033
you realize that maybe the Earth's motion counts.

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:23.119
So, a second tempting answer is,

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.804
"19 miles/second around the Sun."

00:00:25.804 --> 00:00:27.681
But then you recall learning that the Sun

00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:30.519
moves around the center of the Milky Way galaxy,

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.982
and the Milky Way moves within the Local Group of galaxies,

00:00:33.982 --> 00:00:36.814
and the Local Group moves within the Virgo Cluster,

00:00:36.814 --> 00:00:39.233
and the Virgo Cluster moves within...

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:40.569
"How fast are you moving?"

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:42.154
is not an easy question.

00:00:42.154 --> 00:00:43.864
When Mission Control tells astronauts

00:00:43.864 --> 00:00:45.240
how fast they're going,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.327
there's always an assumed standard of rest.

00:00:48.327 --> 00:00:49.413
At the start of the voyage,

00:00:49.413 --> 00:00:51.782
speeds are given relative to the launchpad.

00:00:51.782 --> 00:00:53.365
But later, when the launchpad is

00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:54.866
just one more arbritrary place

00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.921
down there on Earth's spinning surface,

00:00:56.921 --> 00:00:58.618
speeds are given relative to

00:00:58.618 --> 00:01:03.341
the idealized, non-spinning pinpoint center of Earth.

00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:04.469
On their way to the Moon,

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:06.424
Apollo astronauts had a hard time

00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:07.592
answering the question,

00:01:07.592 --> 00:01:09.641
"How fast are you moving?"

00:01:09.641 --> 00:01:11.841
Speed away from Earth was one thing,

00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:14.506
and speed toward the Moon was quite another.

00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:16.007
That's because the Earth and the Moon

00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:18.065
move relative to one another.

00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:19.474
Ah, of course!

00:01:19.474 --> 00:01:21.687
Speed is a relative quantity.

00:01:21.687 --> 00:01:24.683
When Captain Kirk ask Lieutenant Sulu

00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:27.839
if the Starship Enterprise has reached a speed of warp 7,

00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:29.409
Sulu should reply, 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.245
"Relative to what, Captain?"

00:01:31.245 --> 00:01:32.749
Such a sassy reply

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:35.124
may get subordinate Starfleet officers in trouble,

00:01:35.124 --> 00:01:36.916
but it is the only good answer

00:01:36.916 --> 00:01:39.380
to the question, "How fast are you moving?"

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.256
This is basic relatively talking.

00:01:41.256 --> 00:01:43.800
Not fancy Einsteinian relativity,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.141
but good old fashioned (and still correct)

00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:48.226
Galilean relativity.

00:01:48.226 --> 00:01:50.222
Galileo seems to have been the first person

00:01:50.222 --> 00:01:52.006
to realize that there is no such thing

00:01:52.006 --> 00:01:54.061
as an absolute speed.

00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:56.311
Speeds are relative.

00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:58.467
This means that speeds only have meaning

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:01.443
when they are referred to a reference frame.

00:02:01.443 --> 00:02:05.433
Presumably that reference frame is itself at rest.

00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:07.365
But then we have to ask again,

00:02:07.365 --> 00:02:09.367
"At rest relative to what?"

00:02:09.367 --> 00:02:11.119
Because even the concept of rest

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:14.036
has lost any hint of absolute meaning.

00:02:14.036 --> 00:02:16.840
Speed is relative, and rest is relative.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.395
Earth's speed is 19 miles/second relative to the Sun.

00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:23.506
The Enterprise's speed is warp 7

00:02:23.506 --> 00:02:26.469
relative to the center of the Milky Way galaxy.

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:30.415
Your speed is zero relative to your easy chair.

00:02:30.415 --> 00:02:32.018
But depending on where you sit,

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:35.922
it is hundreds of miles/hour relative to Earth's center.

00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:37.589
When we furrow a brow and ask,

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:39.813
"But how fast is Earth really moving?"

00:02:39.813 --> 00:02:41.858
we imagine Spaceship Earth

00:02:41.858 --> 00:02:43.483
plowing through the ocean of space

00:02:43.483 --> 00:02:45.278
as it orbits the Sun.

00:02:45.278 --> 00:02:46.859
But space is not an ocean.

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.156
It has no substance as water does.

00:02:49.156 --> 00:02:51.451
Space is not a thing;

00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:53.827
space is nothing.

00:02:53.827 --> 00:02:55.329
Space is no thing.

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.505
You can move between two points in space,

00:02:57.505 --> 00:02:59.208
say between Earth and Mars,

00:02:59.208 --> 00:03:01.461
but you can't move through space.

00:03:01.461 --> 00:03:03.011
There's nothing to move through.

00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:05.598
It's like trying to say how much a hole weighs.

00:03:05.598 --> 00:03:08.089
A hole weighs exactly nothing

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:10.005
because a hole is nothing.

00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:12.546
It's a void, and so is space.

00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:15.724
To move relative to nothing is meaningless.

00:03:15.724 --> 00:03:18.340
The concepts of speed and of rest

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.963
have only relative meaning.

00:03:19.963 --> 00:03:21.856
They are absolutely meaningless.

00:03:21.856 --> 00:03:23.512
They mean something

00:03:23.512 --> 00:03:25.444
only with respect to arbitrarily chosen,

00:03:25.444 --> 00:03:28.190
artificial frames of reference.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.653
If, someday, you are buckled into your spaceship,

00:03:30.653 --> 00:03:32.699
and you see from the side window, say,

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:35.655
a space station whizz by at constant speed,

00:03:35.655 --> 00:03:38.543
there is no way to know which of you is really moving.

00:03:38.543 --> 00:03:40.291
Neither of you is really moving

00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:42.854
because there is no deep reality about constant speed.

00:03:42.854 --> 00:03:45.024
Constant speed in a straight line

00:03:45.024 --> 00:03:46.922
has only relative meaning,

00:03:46.922 --> 00:03:49.175
a kind of relative reality.

00:03:49.175 --> 00:03:51.595
Does this mean that all motion is relative?

00:03:51.595 --> 00:03:54.765
No! Some motions have only relative meaning,

00:03:54.765 --> 00:03:56.907
but some motions have absolute meaning,

00:03:56.907 --> 00:03:59.019
are absolutely real.

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.276
For example, constant speed is relative,

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:04.691
but change in speed is absolute.

00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:06.792
Calling something absolute in science

00:04:06.792 --> 00:04:09.781
means that arbitrary standards are not used

00:04:09.781 --> 00:04:10.947
in its measurement.

00:04:10.947 --> 00:04:13.115
It is unambiguously measurable.

00:04:13.115 --> 00:04:15.404
When your spaceship fires its engines,

00:04:15.404 --> 00:04:18.402
your change in speed is beyond doubt.

00:04:18.402 --> 00:04:19.872
You feel it in your stomach,

00:04:19.872 --> 00:04:21.972
and your ship's sensors can measure it.

00:04:21.972 --> 00:04:23.250
Outside your window,

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.303
the passing space station

00:04:24.303 --> 00:04:26.255
may seem to be changing speed,

00:04:26.255 --> 00:04:29.005
but the beings inside the station will not feel it.

00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:30.671
And no sensors can measure it.

00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:32.738
You are really changing speed,

00:04:32.738 --> 00:04:34.721
and they are really are not.

00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:36.306
There's something absolutely real

00:04:36.306 --> 00:04:38.588
about changes in speed.

00:04:38.588 --> 00:04:40.589
The same goes for rotation.

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:42.172
If your spaceship is spinning,

00:04:42.172 --> 00:04:43.172
you can feel it,

00:04:43.172 --> 00:04:44.730
and your ship's sensors can measure it.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.065
The space station outside

00:04:46.065 --> 00:04:47.817
may seem to be going around you,

00:04:47.817 --> 00:04:49.483
but it is you who feels queasy,

00:04:49.483 --> 00:04:51.361
not the folks in the space station.

00:04:51.361 --> 00:04:52.949
You are really spinning,

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.556
and they really are not.

00:04:54.556 --> 00:04:57.367
There's something absolutely real about rotation.

00:04:57.367 --> 00:05:00.287
So, some motions are relative, and some are not.

00:05:00.287 --> 00:05:02.844
There is no deep reality about constant speed,

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:05.710
but changes in speed are deeply real,

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.090
and so are rotations.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.254
We have to be thoughtful

00:05:08.254 --> 00:05:09.755
in our analysis of everyday experience

00:05:09.755 --> 00:05:12.422
in order to identify what is deeply real.

00:05:12.422 --> 00:05:14.645
Since we can be fooled by perceptions

00:05:14.645 --> 00:05:16.006
as basic as speed,

00:05:16.006 --> 00:05:18.589
maybe every perception deserves careful scrutiny.

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:20.537
This is what inspired Einstein

00:05:20.537 --> 00:05:21.949
to his incredible insights

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:24.278
about the speed of light and forward time travel.

00:05:24.278 --> 00:05:25.979
Knowing how to identify

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.565
what is deeply real

00:05:27.565 --> 00:05:30.191
is tough and important work.

00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:33.322
If a police officer ever pulls you over for speeding

00:05:33.322 --> 00:05:35.858
and asks, &amp;quot;Do you know how fast you were going?&amp;quot;

00:05:35.858 --> 00:05:39.272
an insightful, though perhaps unwise, reply

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:41.775
would be, "Relative to what?"

00:05:41.775 --> 00:05:44.499
And then, as you sit in the backseat of the police car

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:46.358
and feel it accelerate toward jail,

00:05:46.358 --> 00:05:48.194
you can add,

00:05:48.194 --> 00:05:52.194
&amp;quot;But some things are absolute!&amp;quot;
