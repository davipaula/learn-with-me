00:00:06.821 --> 00:00:12.921
In 1796, Thomas Jefferson received
a box of bones he couldn't identify.

00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:16.232
A long, sharp claw reminded him of a lion,

00:00:16.232 --> 00:00:19.433
but the arm bones 
suggested a larger animal,

00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:22.322
one about three meters long.

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:26.661
Thinking it might be huge unknown
species of North American lion,

00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:30.003
Jefferson warned explorers Lewis and Clark

00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:34.562
to keep an eye out 
for this mysterious predator.

00:00:34.562 --> 00:00:38.102
But Jefferson's box of bones didn't
come from a lion.

00:00:38.102 --> 00:00:42.203
They came from an extinct giant sloth.

00:00:42.203 --> 00:00:47.554
Prehistoric ground sloths first appeared
around 35 million years ago.

00:00:47.554 --> 00:00:51.923
Dozens of species lived across
North, Central and South America,

00:00:51.923 --> 00:00:54.653
alongside other ancient creatures
like mastodons

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:57.434
and giant armadillos.

00:00:57.434 --> 00:01:01.633
Some ground sloths, like the megalonychid,
were cat-sized,

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:03.824
but many were massive.

00:01:03.824 --> 00:01:07.634
Jefferson's sloth, Megalonyx,
weighed about a ton,

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:10.334
and that was small 
compared to megatherium,

00:01:10.334 --> 00:01:15.157
which could reach six metric tons,
as much as an elephant.

00:01:15.157 --> 00:01:19.174
They ambled through the forests
and savannas using their strong arms

00:01:19.174 --> 00:01:20.525
and sharp claws

00:01:20.525 --> 00:01:23.394
to uproot plants and climb trees,

00:01:23.394 --> 00:01:28.695
grazing on grasses, leaves,
and prehistoric avocados.

00:01:28.695 --> 00:01:34.745
In fact, we might not have avocados
today if not for the giant sloths.

00:01:34.745 --> 00:01:38.626
Smaller animals couldn't swallow
the avocado's huge seed,

00:01:38.626 --> 00:01:40.136
but the sloths could,

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:44.555
and they spread avocado trees
far and wide.

00:01:44.555 --> 00:01:47.476
Ground sloths flourished for millions
of years,

00:01:47.476 --> 00:01:51.115
but around 10,000 years ago,
they started disappearing

00:01:51.115 --> 00:01:55.674
along with the Western Hemisphere's
other giant mammals.

00:01:55.674 --> 00:01:58.816
Researchers think that ground sloths
could have been pushed out

00:01:58.816 --> 00:02:01.106
by an oncoming ice age,

00:02:01.106 --> 00:02:04.586
or competition with other species,
maybe humans,

00:02:04.586 --> 00:02:09.405
who arrived in the region around the time
most of the sloths went extinct.

00:02:09.405 --> 00:02:13.577
Some of the smaller sloths did survive
and migrated to the treetops.

00:02:13.577 --> 00:02:18.317
Today, there are six species left
living in the rainforest canopies

00:02:18.317 --> 00:02:21.358
of Central and South America.

00:02:21.358 --> 00:02:24.468
Hanging out in the trees is a good way
to avoid predators,

00:02:24.468 --> 00:02:27.187
and there are plenty of leaves to eat.

00:02:27.187 --> 00:02:29.576
But this diet has its drawbacks.

00:02:29.576 --> 00:02:33.927
Animals extract energy from food
and use that energy to move around,

00:02:33.927 --> 00:02:35.588
maintain their body temperature,

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:36.947
keep their organs working,

00:02:36.947 --> 00:02:40.609
and all the other activities necessary
for survival.

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.748
But leaves don't contain much energy,

00:02:43.748 --> 00:02:47.498
and that which they do have
is tough to extract.

00:02:47.498 --> 00:02:51.818
Most herbivores supplement a leafy diet
with higher energy foods

00:02:51.818 --> 00:02:54.439
like fruit and seeds.

00:02:54.439 --> 00:03:01.118
But sloths, especially three-toed sloths,
rely on leaves almost exclusively.

00:03:01.118 --> 00:03:06.427
They've evolved finely tuned strategies
for coping with this restricted diet.

00:03:06.427 --> 00:03:12.628
First, they extract as much energy from
their food as possible.

00:03:12.628 --> 00:03:17.071
Sloths have a multi-chambered stomach
that takes up a third of their body,

00:03:17.071 --> 00:03:18.748
and depending on the species,

00:03:18.748 --> 00:03:25.098
they can spend five to seven days,
or even weeks, processing a meal.

00:03:25.098 --> 00:03:29.457
The other piece of the puzzle
is to use as little energy as possible.

00:03:29.457 --> 00:03:34.450
One way sloths do this is, of course,
by not moving very much.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.959
They spend most of their time eating,
resting, or sleeping.

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.809
They descend from the canopy just once
a week for a bathroom break.

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:46.350
When sloths do move, it's not very fast.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.819
It would take a sloth about five minutes
to cross an average neighborhood street.

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:57.480
This unhurried approach to life means
that sloths don't need very much muscle.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.110
In fact, they have about 30% less
muscle mass than other animals their size.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.400
Sloths also use less energy 
to keep themselves warm

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.281
because their body temperature
can fluctuate by about five degrees Celsius,

00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:17.023
less than a cold-blooded reptile,
but more than most mammals.

00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:22.131
These physical and behavioral adaptations 
minimize the sloth's energy expenditure,

00:04:22.131 --> 00:04:24.890
or metabolic rate.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.560
Three-toed sloths have the slowest 
metabolism of any mammal.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.922
The giant panda is second slowest,

00:04:32.922 --> 00:04:35.972
and two-toed sloths come in third.

00:04:35.972 --> 00:04:41.781
Moving slowly has allowed sloths
to thrive in their treetop habitat.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:46.982
But it's also made the sloths themselves
a great habitat for other organisms,

00:04:46.982 --> 00:04:54.243
including algae, which provides a little
extra camouflage, and maybe even a snack.

00:04:54.243 --> 00:04:56.922
Sloths may not be giant anymore,

00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:59.582
but that doesn't make 
them any less remarkable.
