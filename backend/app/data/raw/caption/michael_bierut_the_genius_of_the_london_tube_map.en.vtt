00:00:12.444 --> 00:00:16.261
The history of civilization,
in some ways, is a history of maps:

00:00:16.285 --> 00:00:18.984
How have we come to understand
the world around us?

00:00:19.008 --> 00:00:23.264
One of the most famous maps works
because it really isn't a map at all.

00:00:23.288 --> 00:00:25.991
[Small thing. Big idea.]

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.452
[Michael Bierut on
the London Tube Map]

00:00:29.707 --> 00:00:32.541
The London Underground
came together in 1908,

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:35.337
when eight different
independent railways merged

00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:37.080
to create a single system.

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:39.335
They needed a map to represent that system

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:41.081
so people would know where to ride.

00:00:41.105 --> 00:00:44.162
The map they made is complicated.

00:00:44.186 --> 00:00:47.138
You can see rivers,
bodies of water, trees and parks --

00:00:47.162 --> 00:00:50.221
the stations were all crammed together
at the center of the map,

00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:53.846
and out in the periphery, there were some
that couldn't even fit on the map.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.042
So the map was geographically accurate,
but maybe not so useful.

00:00:58.066 --> 00:00:59.484
Enter Harry Beck.

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:03.360
Harry Beck was a 29-year-old
engineering draftsman

00:01:03.384 --> 00:01:06.176
who had been working on and off
for the London Underground.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.445
And he had a key insight,

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:11.097
and that was that people
riding underground in trains

00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:13.787
don't really care
what's happening aboveground.

00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:16.296
They just want to get
from station to station --

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.304
"Where do I get on? Where do I get off?"

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:21.066
It's the system that's important,
not the geography.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.978
He's taken this complicated
mess of spaghetti,

00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:25.485
and he's simplified it.

00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:27.753
The lines only go in three directions:

00:01:27.777 --> 00:01:31.097
they're horizontal, they're vertical,
or they're 45 degrees.

00:01:31.121 --> 00:01:34.089
Likewise, he spaced the stations equally,

00:01:34.113 --> 00:01:38.049
he's made every station color
correspond to the color of the line,

00:01:38.073 --> 00:01:42.223
and he's fixed it all
so that it's not really a map anymore.

00:01:42.247 --> 00:01:44.144
What it is is a diagram,

00:01:44.168 --> 00:01:45.403
just like circuitry,

00:01:45.427 --> 00:01:49.120
except the circuitry here
isn't wires conducting electrons,

00:01:49.144 --> 00:01:53.486
it's tubes containing trains
conducting people from place to place.

00:01:53.835 --> 00:01:59.152
In 1933, the Underground decided, at last,
to give Harry Beck's map a try.

00:01:59.176 --> 00:02:02.612
The Underground did a test run
of a thousand of these maps, pocket-size.

00:02:02.636 --> 00:02:03.993
They were gone in one hour.

00:02:04.017 --> 00:02:05.930
They realized they were onto something,

00:02:05.954 --> 00:02:08.446
they printed 750,000 more,

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.909
and this is the map that you see today.

00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:13.435
Beck's design really became the template

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.907
for the way we think of metro maps today.

00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:20.765
Tokyo, Paris, Berlin, SÃ£o Paulo,
Sydney, Washington, D.C. --

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:23.363
all of them convert complex geography

00:02:23.387 --> 00:02:25.055
into crisp geometry.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.516
All of them use different colors
to distinguish between lines,

00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:32.688
all of them use simple symbols
to distinguish between types of stations.

00:02:32.773 --> 00:02:35.712
They all are part
of a universal language, seemingly.

00:02:35.804 --> 00:02:39.498
I bet Harry Beck wouldn't have known
what a user interface was,

00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:41.779
but that's really what he designed

00:02:41.803 --> 00:02:45.142
and he really took that challenge
and broke it down to three principles

00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:47.838
that I think can be applied
in nearly any design problem.

00:02:47.863 --> 00:02:49.013
First one is focus.

00:02:49.143 --> 00:02:51.143
Focus on who you're doing this for.

00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:53.501
The second principle is simplicity.

00:02:53.553 --> 00:02:56.381
What's the shortest way
to deliver that need?

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.313
Finally, the last thing is:

00:02:58.338 --> 00:03:00.541
Thinking in a cross-disciplinary way.

00:03:00.642 --> 00:03:03.435
Who would've thought
that an electrical engineer

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.779
would be the person to hold the key

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.873
to unlock what was then one of the most
complicated systems in the world --

00:03:10.028 --> 00:03:12.790
all started by one guy
with a pencil and an idea.
