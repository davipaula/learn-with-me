00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.056
The most astounding place I've ever been

00:00:13.056 --> 00:00:15.461
is the Mosquitia rainforest in Honduras.

00:00:15.461 --> 00:00:18.048
I've done archaeological fieldwork
all over the world,

00:00:18.048 --> 00:00:21.229
so I thought I knew what to expect
venturing into the jungle,

00:00:21.335 --> 00:00:22.742
but I was wrong -

00:00:23.283 --> 00:00:25.335
for the first time in my life, 
I might add.

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:27.582
(Laughter)

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:30.200
First of all, it's freezing.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.369
It's 90 degrees,

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.474
but you're soaking wet
from the humidity,

00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:35.688
and the canopy of trees is so thick

00:00:35.688 --> 00:00:37.976
that sunlight never reaches the surface.

00:00:38.155 --> 00:00:39.563
You can't get dry.

00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:40.938
Immediately,

00:00:40.938 --> 00:00:43.278
I knew that I hadn't brought
enough clothing.

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:45.594
That first night,

00:00:45.652 --> 00:00:48.486
I kept feeling things moving
underneath my hammock,

00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:53.451
unknown creatures brushing and poking 
against the thin nylon fabric.

00:00:53.907 --> 00:00:56.704
And I could barely sleep 
through all the noise.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.238
The jungle is loud. 
It's shockingly loud.

00:00:59.238 --> 00:01:02.068
It's like being downtown
in a bustling city.

00:01:02.861 --> 00:01:04.216
As the night wore on,

00:01:04.216 --> 00:01:07.593
I became increasingly frustrated
with my sleeplessness,

00:01:07.698 --> 00:01:09.973
knowing I had a full day ahead.

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:12.147
When I finally got up at dawn,

00:01:12.557 --> 00:01:15.330
my sense of unseen things
was all too real.

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:17.910
There were hoofprints, paw prints,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.621
linear snake tracks everywhere.

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:23.438
And what's even more shocking,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.704
we saw those same animals in the daylight,

00:01:25.704 --> 00:01:28.140
and they were completely unafraid of us.

00:01:28.556 --> 00:01:30.946
They had no experience with people.

00:01:31.336 --> 00:01:33.456
They had no reason to be afraid.

00:01:34.804 --> 00:01:37.255
As I walked towards the undocumented city,

00:01:37.255 --> 00:01:38.845
my reason for being there,

00:01:38.845 --> 00:01:41.863
I realized that this was the only place
that I'd ever been

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.665
where I didn't see
a single shred of plastic.

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:47.192
That's how remote it was.

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:52.247
Perhaps it's surprising to learn
that there are still places on our planet

00:01:52.685 --> 00:01:54.964
that are so untouched by people,

00:01:54.964 --> 00:01:56.265
but it's true.

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:58.647
There are still hundreds of places

00:01:58.647 --> 00:02:01.067
where people haven't stepped
for centuries,

00:02:01.067 --> 00:02:02.539
or maybe forever.

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.132
It's an awesome time 
to be an archaeologist.

00:02:06.257 --> 00:02:08.827
We have the tools and the technology

00:02:09.084 --> 00:02:11.899
to understand our planet
like never before.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.701
And yet we're running out of time.

00:02:15.175 --> 00:02:20.839
The climate crisis threatens to destroy
our ecological and cultural patrimony.

00:02:21.882 --> 00:02:26.011
I feel an urgency to my work
that I didn't feel 20 years ago.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.128
How can we document everything
before it's too late?

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:33.879
I was trained
as a traditional archaeologist

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.051
using methodologies 
that have been around since the '50s.

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:40.609
That all changed in July of 2009

00:02:41.134 --> 00:02:42.894
in Michoacán, Mexico.

00:02:43.068 --> 00:02:45.188
I was studying the ancient
Purépecha empire,

00:02:45.243 --> 00:02:46.497
which is a lesser known

00:02:46.497 --> 00:02:49.519
but equally important
contemporary of the Aztec.

00:02:50.107 --> 00:02:51.193
Two weeks earlier,

00:02:51.193 --> 00:02:53.841
my team had documented
an unknown settlement,

00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:59.891
so we were painstakingly mapping
building foundations by hand -

00:03:00.453 --> 00:03:02.073
hundreds of them.

00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:06.337
Basic archaeological protocol
is to find the edge of a settlement

00:03:06.337 --> 00:03:08.187
so you know 
what you're dealing with.

00:03:08.425 --> 00:03:11.425
And my graduate students
convinced me to do just that.

00:03:12.397 --> 00:03:15.787
So I grabbed a couple of CLIF Bars,
some water, a walkie,

00:03:16.283 --> 00:03:18.125
and I set out alone on foot,

00:03:18.308 --> 00:03:21.938
expecting to encounter the edge 
in just a few minutes.

00:03:22.306 --> 00:03:25.267
A few minutes passed,
and then an hour.

00:03:25.783 --> 00:03:28.593
Finally, I reached
the other side of the malpais.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.319
Oh, there were ancient
building foundations all the way across.

00:03:33.422 --> 00:03:35.811
It's a city? Oh, shit.

00:03:35.811 --> 00:03:36.913
(Laughter)

00:03:36.913 --> 00:03:38.137
It's a city.

00:03:39.977 --> 00:03:42.867
Turns out that this
seemingly small settlement

00:03:42.984 --> 00:03:46.004
was actually an ancient urban megalopolis,

00:03:46.187 --> 00:03:48.627
26 square kilometers in size,

00:03:48.964 --> 00:03:52.653
with as many building foundations 
as modern-day Manhattan,

00:03:53.195 --> 00:03:56.117
an archaeological settlement so large

00:03:56.148 --> 00:03:58.654
that it would take me decades
to survey fully,

00:03:59.373 --> 00:04:01.283
the entire rest of my career,

00:04:02.124 --> 00:04:07.590
which was exactly how I didn't want
to spend the entire rest of my career ...

00:04:07.644 --> 00:04:08.838
(Laughter)

00:04:09.393 --> 00:04:11.620
sweating, exhausted,

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.883
placating stressed-out
graduate students ...

00:04:14.883 --> 00:04:16.209
(Laughter)

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.852
tossing scraps of PB&amp;J sandwiches

00:04:18.852 --> 00:04:20.356
to feral dogs,

00:04:20.356 --> 00:04:22.454
which is pointless, by the way,

00:04:22.487 --> 00:04:25.431
because Mexican dogs
really don't like peanut butter.

00:04:25.545 --> 00:04:28.752
(Laughter)

00:04:28.812 --> 00:04:31.840
Just the thought of it bored me to tears.

00:04:32.382 --> 00:04:34.230
So I returned home to Colorado,

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.489
and I poked my head 
through a colleague's door.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.958
Dude! There's got to be a better way!

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.144
He asked if I had heard 
of this new technology called LiDAR -

00:04:43.144 --> 00:04:44.765
Light Detection and Ranging.

00:04:44.835 --> 00:04:46.115
I looked it up.

00:04:46.278 --> 00:04:49.478
LiDAR involves shooting 
a dense grid of laser pulses

00:04:49.577 --> 00:04:52.160
from an airplane to the ground's surface.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.261
What you end up with
is a high resolution scan

00:04:55.392 --> 00:04:57.492
of the earth's surface
and everything on it.

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.411
It's not an image,

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:02.689
but instead it's a dense, 
three dimensional plot of points.

00:05:03.444 --> 00:05:06.764
We had enough money in to scan,

00:05:08.116 --> 00:05:09.456
so we did just that.

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:12.659
The company went to Mexico,
they flew the LiDAR,

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:14.709
and they sent back the data.

00:05:15.035 --> 00:05:16.428
Over the next several months,

00:05:16.428 --> 00:05:18.867
I learned to practice 
digital deforestation,

00:05:19.174 --> 00:05:22.734
filtering away trees, brush
and other vegetation

00:05:22.907 --> 00:05:25.887
to reveal the ancient
cultural landscape below.

00:05:26.734 --> 00:05:28.952
When I looked at my first visualization,

00:05:29.226 --> 00:05:31.214
I began to cry,

00:05:31.404 --> 00:05:33.365
which I know comes
as quite a shock to you

00:05:33.365 --> 00:05:35.550
given how manly I must seem.

00:05:35.567 --> 00:05:37.684
(Laughter)

00:05:38.685 --> 00:05:41.097
In just 45 minutes of flying,

00:05:41.097 --> 00:05:43.606
the LiDAR had collected 
the same amount of data

00:05:43.606 --> 00:05:45.942
as what would have taken decades by hand:

00:05:46.536 --> 00:05:52.019
every house foundation, building, 
road and pyramid, incredible detail,

00:05:52.588 --> 00:05:55.545
representing the lives 
of thousands of people

00:05:56.142 --> 00:05:59.372
who lived and loved and died
in these spaces.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.343
And what's more, the quality of the data

00:06:02.655 --> 00:06:05.933
wasn't comparable to traditional
archaeological research.

00:06:06.735 --> 00:06:08.735
It was much, much better.

00:06:09.645 --> 00:06:11.557
I knew that this technology

00:06:11.557 --> 00:06:15.009
would change the entire field
of archaeology in the coming years.

00:06:15.597 --> 00:06:16.777
And it did.

00:06:18.764 --> 00:06:21.897
Our work came to the attention
of a group of filmmakers

00:06:21.897 --> 00:06:24.677
who were searching 
for a legendary lost city in Honduras.

00:06:25.386 --> 00:06:27.011
They failed in their quest, 

00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:30.010
but they instead 
documented an unknown culture

00:06:30.287 --> 00:06:33.759
now buried under a pristine 
wilderness rainforest,

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:35.197
using LiDAR.

00:06:36.426 --> 00:06:38.315
I agreed to help interpret their data,

00:06:38.315 --> 00:06:42.007
which is how I found myself
deep in that Mosquitia jungle,

00:06:42.474 --> 00:06:45.544
plastic-free and filled
with curious animals.

00:06:46.417 --> 00:06:48.411
Our goal was to verify

00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:51.713
that the archaeological features 
we identified in our LiDAR

00:06:51.885 --> 00:06:54.455
were actually there on the ground,
and they were.

00:06:55.438 --> 00:06:59.663
Eleven months later, I returned 
with a crack team of archaeologists,

00:06:59.788 --> 00:07:02.365
sponsored by
the National Geographic Society

00:07:02.766 --> 00:07:04.596
and the Honduran government.

00:07:04.635 --> 00:07:07.267
In a month, we excavated over 400 objects

00:07:07.614 --> 00:07:10.211
from what we now call
the City of the Jaguar.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:15.699
We felt a moral and ethical responsibility
to protect the site as it was,

00:07:16.102 --> 00:07:18.685
but in the short time that we were there,

00:07:18.685 --> 00:07:20.745
things inevitably changed.

00:07:21.062 --> 00:07:24.165
The tiny gravel bar
where we first landed our helicopter

00:07:24.368 --> 00:07:25.563
was gone.

00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:28.871
The brush had been cleared away
and the trees were moved

00:07:29.075 --> 00:07:32.535
to create a large landing zone
for several helicopters at once.

00:07:33.094 --> 00:07:36.521
Without it, after just one rainy season,

00:07:36.765 --> 00:07:39.667
the ancient canals 
that we had seen in our LiDAR scan

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:42.089
were damaged or destroyed.

00:07:42.586 --> 00:07:47.274
And the Eden I described
soon had a large clearing, central camp,

00:07:47.712 --> 00:07:50.519
lights and an outdoor chapel.

00:07:50.836 --> 00:07:52.046
In other words, 

00:07:52.096 --> 00:07:55.351
despite our best efforts 
to protect the site as it was,

00:07:56.003 --> 00:07:57.500
things changed.

00:07:58.034 --> 00:08:02.238
Our initial LiDAR scan 
of this City of the Jaguar

00:08:02.495 --> 00:08:07.604
is the only record of this place
as it existed just a few years ago.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:11.640
And broadly speaking,
this is a problem for archaeologists.

00:08:11.998 --> 00:08:15.189
We can't study an area
without changing it somehow,

00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:18.276
and regardless, the earth is changing.

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:20.882
Archaeological sites are destroyed,

00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:23.869
history is lost.

00:08:24.105 --> 00:08:26.260
Just this year, we watched in horror

00:08:26.431 --> 00:08:29.149
as the Notre Dame Cathedral
went up in flames.

00:08:29.538 --> 00:08:33.757
The iconic spire collapsed,
and the roof was all but destroyed.

00:08:34.266 --> 00:08:35.719
Miraculously,

00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:38.625
the art historian Andrew Tallon
and colleagues

00:08:38.625 --> 00:08:41.436
scanned the cathedral in 2010 using LiDAR.

00:08:42.288 --> 00:08:46.083
At the time, their goal was to understand
how the building was constructed.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.460
Now, their LiDAR scan

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:51.447
is the most comprehensive record 
of the cathedral,

00:08:51.466 --> 00:08:54.508
and it will prove invaluable
in the reconstruction.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.700
They couldn't have anticipated the fire
or how their scan would be used,

00:08:59.783 --> 00:09:01.863
but we are lucky to have it.

00:09:02.323 --> 00:09:05.429
We take for granted that our cultural
and ecological patrimony

00:09:05.459 --> 00:09:07.081
will be around forever.

00:09:07.299 --> 00:09:08.568
It won't.

00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:12.051
Organizations like SCI-Arc 
and Virtual Wonders

00:09:12.138 --> 00:09:17.089
are doing incredible work to record
the world's historic monuments,

00:09:18.122 --> 00:09:21.342
but nothing similar exists
for the earth's landscapes.

00:09:22.023 --> 00:09:24.703
We've lost 50 percent of our rainforest.

00:09:24.824 --> 00:09:27.737
We lose 18 million acres
of forest every year.

00:09:28.279 --> 00:09:33.528
And rising sea levels will make cities,
countries and continents

00:09:33.787 --> 00:09:35.927
completely unrecognizable.

00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:38.811
Unless we have a record of these places,

00:09:39.135 --> 00:09:41.615
no one in the future
will know they existed.

00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:46.583
If the earth is the Titanic,
we've struck the iceberg,

00:09:46.583 --> 00:09:49.722
everyone's on deck,
and the orchestra is playing.

00:09:50.382 --> 00:09:54.882
The climate crisis threatens to destroy
our cultural and ecological patrimony

00:09:55.239 --> 00:09:56.854
within decades.

00:09:57.236 --> 00:10:01.382
But sitting on our hands 
and doing nothing is not an option.

00:10:02.023 --> 00:10:04.820
Shouldn't we save everything
we can on the lifeboats?

00:10:04.873 --> 00:10:08.189
(Applause)

00:10:12.708 --> 00:10:16.034
Looking at my scans
from Honduras and Mexico,

00:10:16.116 --> 00:10:19.020
it's clear that we need
to scan, scan, scan

00:10:19.451 --> 00:10:21.531
now as much as possible,

00:10:21.999 --> 00:10:23.369
while we still can.

00:10:23.991 --> 00:10:26.414
That's what inspired the Earth Archive,

00:10:26.471 --> 00:10:31.489
an unprecedented scientific effort
to LiDAR-scan the entire planet,

00:10:31.942 --> 00:10:34.279
starting with areas
that are most threatened.

00:10:35.129 --> 00:10:37.235
Its purpose is threefold.

00:10:37.751 --> 00:10:39.101
Number one:

00:10:39.335 --> 00:10:43.135
create a baseline record
of the earth as it exists today

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:45.869
to more effectively mitigate
the climate crisis.

00:10:46.887 --> 00:10:49.477
To measure change,
you need two sets of data:

00:10:49.762 --> 00:10:51.759
a before and an after.

00:10:52.256 --> 00:10:56.106
Right now, we don't have
a high-resolution before-data set

00:10:56.422 --> 00:10:57.966
for much of the planet,

00:10:58.364 --> 00:11:00.352
so we can't measure change,

00:11:00.352 --> 00:11:01.762
and we can't evaluate

00:11:01.762 --> 00:11:05.114
which of our current efforts
to combat the climate crisis

00:11:05.114 --> 00:11:07.292
are making a positive impact.

00:11:08.679 --> 00:11:09.849
Number two:

00:11:10.231 --> 00:11:14.081
create a virtual planet

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:17.972
so that any number of scientists
can study our earth today.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:22.418
Archaeologists like me
can look for undocumented settlements.

00:11:23.217 --> 00:11:27.505
Ecologists can study tree size,
forest composition and age.

00:11:28.215 --> 00:11:32.352
Geologists can study hydrology,
faults, disturbance.

00:11:33.046 --> 00:11:35.046
The possibilities are endless.

00:11:35.759 --> 00:11:36.961
Number three:

00:11:37.124 --> 00:11:41.381
preserve a record of the planet
for our grandchildren's grandchildren

00:11:41.765 --> 00:11:47.003
so they can reconstruct and study
lost cultural patrimony in the future.

00:11:48.413 --> 00:11:54.063
As science and technology advance,
they'll apply new tools, algorithms,

00:11:54.375 --> 00:11:57.815
even AI to LiDAR scans done today

00:11:58.135 --> 00:12:01.767
and ask questions 
that we can't currently conceive of.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:08.686
Like Notre Dame, we can't imagine
how these records will be used,

00:12:09.539 --> 00:12:12.065
but we know that they'll be
critically important.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.802
The Earth Archive is the ultimate gift
to future generations.

00:12:18.457 --> 00:12:20.910
Because the truth be told,

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.890
I won't live long enough
to see its full impact

00:12:24.459 --> 00:12:25.999
and neither will you.

00:12:27.178 --> 00:12:29.678
That's exactly why it's worth doing.

00:12:30.456 --> 00:12:34.400
The Earth Archive is a bet
on the future of humanity.

00:12:34.602 --> 00:12:38.012
It's a bet that together, collectively,

00:12:38.306 --> 00:12:40.896
as people and as scientists,

00:12:41.494 --> 00:12:44.309
that we'll face the climate crisis,

00:12:44.318 --> 00:12:47.036
and that we'll choose
to do the right thing,

00:12:47.489 --> 00:12:49.510
not just for us today,

00:12:50.296 --> 00:12:52.877
but to honor those who came before us

00:12:53.369 --> 00:12:56.759
and to pay it forward
to future generations

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.161
who will carry on our legacy.

00:13:00.841 --> 00:13:02.031
Thank you.

00:13:02.127 --> 00:13:05.432
(Applause)
