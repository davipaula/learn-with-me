00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:08.239
You're lifting weights.

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:10.099
The first time feels easy,

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.879
but each lift takes more and more effort 
until you can’t continue.

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:16.184
Inside your arms,

00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:21.074
the muscles responsible for the lifting
have become unable to contract.

00:00:21.074 --> 00:00:23.311
Why do our muscles get fatigued?

00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:26.991
We often blame lactic acid 
or running out of energy,

00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:30.351
but these factors alone don’t account 
for muscle fatigue.

00:00:30.351 --> 00:00:32.371
There’s another major contributor:

00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:36.671
the muscle’s ability to respond 
to signals from the brain.

00:00:36.671 --> 00:00:38.741
To understand the roots of muscle fatigue,

00:00:38.741 --> 00:00:43.461
it helps to know how a muscle contracts 
in response to a signal from a nerve.

00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:47.659
These signals travel from the brain to the
muscles in a fraction of a second

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:51.476
via long, thin cells called motor neurons.

00:00:51.476 --> 00:00:55.616
The motor neuron and the muscle cell 
are separated by a tiny gap,

00:00:55.616 --> 00:01:00.230
and the exchange of particles 
across this gap enables the contraction.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.780
On one side of the gap,

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.020
the motor neuron contains a 
neurotransmitter called acetylcholine.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.264
On the other side,

00:01:07.264 --> 00:01:09.764
charged particles, or ions,

00:01:09.764 --> 00:01:11.854
line the muscle cell’s membrane:

00:01:11.854 --> 00:01:16.074
potassium on the inside, 
and sodium on the outside.

00:01:16.074 --> 00:01:18.224
In response to a signal from the brain,

00:01:18.224 --> 00:01:20.904
the motor neuron releases acetylcholine,

00:01:20.904 --> 00:01:24.714
which triggers pores on the muscle 
cell membrane to open.

00:01:24.714 --> 00:01:28.214
Sodium flows in, and potassium flows out.

00:01:28.214 --> 00:01:33.364
The flux of these charged particles 
is a crucial step for muscle contraction:

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:38.306
the change in charge creates an electrical
signal called an action potential

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:40.346
that spreads through the muscle cell,

00:01:40.346 --> 00:01:44.416
stimulating the release of calcium
that’s stored inside it.

00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:47.466
This flood of calcium causes 
the muscle to contract

00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:51.774
by enabling proteins buried in the muscle 
fibers to lock together

00:01:51.774 --> 00:01:53.664
and ratchet towards each other,

00:01:53.664 --> 00:01:55.284
pulling the muscle tight.

00:01:55.284 --> 00:02:00.914
The energy used to power the contraction
comes from a molecule called ATP.

00:02:00.914 --> 00:02:05.694
ATP also helps pump the ions back 
across the membrane afterward,

00:02:05.694 --> 00:02:10.207
resetting the balance of sodium 
and potassium on either side.

00:02:10.207 --> 00:02:13.987
This whole process repeats 
every time a muscle contracts.

00:02:13.987 --> 00:02:15.217
With each contraction,

00:02:15.217 --> 00:02:18.437
energy in the form of ATP gets used up,

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:21.307
waste products like lactic 
acid are generated,

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:24.727
and some ions drift away from the muscle’s
cell membrane,

00:02:24.727 --> 00:02:27.907
leaving a smaller and 
smaller group behind.

00:02:27.907 --> 00:02:31.867
Though muscle cells use up ATP as they 
contract repeatedly,

00:02:31.867 --> 00:02:33.917
they are always making more,

00:02:33.917 --> 00:02:34.927
so most of the time

00:02:34.927 --> 00:02:39.877
even heavily fatigued muscles still 
have not depleted this energy source.

00:02:39.877 --> 00:02:42.587
And though many waste products are acidic,

00:02:42.587 --> 00:02:46.437
fatigued muscles still maintain pH 
within normal limits,

00:02:46.437 --> 00:02:50.337
indicating that the tissue is effectively
clearing these wastes.

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:53.607
But eventually, over the course of 
repeated contractions

00:02:53.607 --> 00:02:59.027
there may not be sufficient concentrations
of potassium, sodium or calcium ions

00:02:59.027 --> 00:03:01.757
immediately available near 
the muscle cell membrane

00:03:01.757 --> 00:03:04.157
to reset the system properly.

00:03:04.157 --> 00:03:06.187
So even if the brain sends a signal,

00:03:06.187 --> 00:03:11.057
the muscle cell can’t generate the action
potential necessary to contract.

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:14.187
Even when ions like sodium, 
potassium or calcium

00:03:14.187 --> 00:03:16.967
are depleted in or around the muscle cell,

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:19.957
these ions are plentiful 
elsewhere in the body.

00:03:19.957 --> 00:03:20.847
With a little time,

00:03:20.847 --> 00:03:23.427
they will flow back to the areas 
where they’re needed,

00:03:23.427 --> 00:03:27.517
sometimes with the help of active sodium
and potassium pumps.

00:03:27.517 --> 00:03:29.283
So if you pause and rest,

00:03:29.283 --> 00:03:34.363
muscle fatigue will subside as these ions
replenish throughout the muscle.

00:03:34.363 --> 00:03:36.190
The more regularly you exercise,

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.960
the longer it takes for muscle fatigue 
to set in each time.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.790
That’s because the stronger you are,

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.990
the fewer times this cycle of nerve signal
from the brain

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.910
to contraction in the muscle
has to be repeated

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.830
to lift a certain amount of weight.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.080
Fewer cycles means slower ion depletion,

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.380
so as your physical fitness improves,

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.100
you can exercise for longer 
at the same intensity.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.350
Many muscles grow with exercise,

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.160
and larger muscles also 
have bigger stores of ATP

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.500
and a higher capacity to clear waste,

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.500
pushing fatigue even 
farther into the future.
