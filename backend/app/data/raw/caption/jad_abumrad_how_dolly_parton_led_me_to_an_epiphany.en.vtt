00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.690
I want to tell you about my search
for purpose as a journalist

00:00:20.714 --> 00:00:24.134
and how Dolly Parton
helped me figure it out.

00:00:25.038 --> 00:00:27.649
So I've been telling audio stories
for about 20 years,

00:00:27.673 --> 00:00:29.594
first on the radio and then in podcasts.

00:00:29.981 --> 00:00:33.195
When I started the radio show
"Radiolab" in 2002,

00:00:33.883 --> 00:00:36.620
here was the quintessential
story move we would do.

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:38.178
We'd bring on somebody --

00:00:38.203 --> 00:00:40.797
(Audio) Steven Strogatz:
It's one of the most hypnotic

00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:43.265
and spellbinding spectacles in nature,

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:46.384
because, you have to keep in mind,
it is absolutely silent.

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:49.068
Jad Abumrad: Like this guy,
mathematician, Steve Strogatz,

00:00:49.092 --> 00:00:50.504
and he would paint a picture.

00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:52.827
SS: Picture it.
There's a riverbank in Thailand,

00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:54.424
in the remote part of the jungle,

00:00:54.438 --> 00:00:56.861
you're in a canoe,
slipping down the river.

00:00:57.535 --> 00:00:58.956
There's no sound of anything,

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.273
maybe the occasional, you know,
exotic jungle bird or something.

00:01:02.297 --> 00:01:04.622
JA: So you're in this imaginary
canoe with Steve,

00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:08.177
and in the air all around you
are millions of fireflies.

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:12.296
And what you see is sort of
a randomized starry-night effect.

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:15.566
Because all the fireflies
are blinking at different rates.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.091
Which is what you would expect.

00:01:17.487 --> 00:01:20.178
But according to Steve, in this one place,

00:01:20.202 --> 00:01:22.884
for reasons no scientist
can fully explain --

00:01:22.908 --> 00:01:24.058
SS: Whoop.

00:01:24.996 --> 00:01:26.177
Whoop.

00:01:26.924 --> 00:01:28.121
Whoop.

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:31.073
With thousands of lights on
and then off, all in sync.

00:01:31.097 --> 00:01:38.097
(Music and electric sounds)

00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:39.763
JA: Now it's around this time

00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:42.978
that I would generally bring in
the beautiful music, as I just did,

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.010
and you'd start to get that warm feeling.

00:01:45.034 --> 00:01:46.816
A feeling, that we know from science,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.760
kind of localizes in your head and chest

00:01:48.784 --> 00:01:50.237
and spreads through your body.

00:01:50.261 --> 00:01:51.879
It's that feeling of wonder.

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:55.143
From 2002 to 2010,
I did hundreds of these stories.

00:01:56.693 --> 00:02:00.138
Sciency, neurosciency,
very heady, brainy stories

00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:02.860
that would always resolve
into that feeling of wonder.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.419
And I began to see that as my job,

00:02:05.443 --> 00:02:07.817
to lead people to moments of wonder.

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:09.753
What that sounded like was:

00:02:09.777 --> 00:02:13.585
(Various voices) "Huh!" "Wow!" "Wow!"

00:02:14.094 --> 00:02:15.259
"That's amazing."

00:02:15.283 --> 00:02:17.316
"Whoa!" "Wow!"

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.371
JA: But I began to get
kind of tired of these stories.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.673
I mean, partially, it was the repetition.

00:02:22.697 --> 00:02:25.387
I remember there was a day
I was sitting at the computer,

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:26.807
making the sound of a neuron.

00:02:26.831 --> 00:02:27.982
(Crackling sound)

00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:31.325
You know, take some white noise,
chop it up, very easy sound to make.

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.214
I remember thinking,
"I have made this sound 25 times."

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:37.252
But it was more than that --

00:02:37.276 --> 00:02:39.443
there was a familiar path
to these stories.

00:02:39.467 --> 00:02:41.959
You walk the path of truth,
which is made of science,

00:02:41.983 --> 00:02:43.133
and you get to wonder.

00:02:43.157 --> 00:02:45.185
Now, I love science, don't get me wrong.

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.332
My parents emigrated
from a war-torn country,

00:02:47.356 --> 00:02:48.578
came to America,

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:53.427
and science for them was, like,
more their identity than anything else,

00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:55.518
and I inherited that from them.

00:02:56.268 --> 00:02:58.737
But there was something
about that simple movement

00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:00.047
from science to wonder

00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:01.908
that just started to feel wrong to me.

00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:04.051
Like, is that the only path
a story can take?

00:03:04.945 --> 00:03:06.599
Around 2012,

00:03:06.823 --> 00:03:11.076
I ran into a bunch of different stories
that made me think, "No."

00:03:11.466 --> 00:03:12.632
One story in particular,

00:03:12.656 --> 00:03:16.673
where we interviewed
a guy who described chemical weapons

00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:19.325
being used against him
and his fellow villagers

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.587
in the mountains of Laos.

00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:22.547
Western scientists went there,

00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:25.140
measured for chemical weapons,
didn't find any.

00:03:25.164 --> 00:03:26.791
We interviewed the man about this,

00:03:26.815 --> 00:03:28.449
he said the scientists were wrong.

00:03:28.473 --> 00:03:29.878
We said, "But they tested."

00:03:29.902 --> 00:03:32.362
He said, "I don't care,
I know what happened to me."

00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:34.537
And we went back and forth
and back and forth,

00:03:34.561 --> 00:03:36.449
and make a long story short,

00:03:36.473 --> 00:03:38.167
the interview ended in tears.

00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:40.131
I felt ...

00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:41.901
I felt horrible.

00:03:43.036 --> 00:03:46.249
Like, hammering at a scientific truth,
when someone has suffered.

00:03:47.045 --> 00:03:48.997
That wasn't going to heal anything.

00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:53.589
And maybe I was relying
too much on science to find the truth.

00:03:53.918 --> 00:03:55.776
And it really did feel, at that moment,

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.879
that there were a lot
of truths in the room,

00:03:57.903 --> 00:03:59.838
and we were only looking at one of them.

00:03:59.862 --> 00:04:02.053
So I thought, "I've got to get
better at this."

00:04:02.077 --> 00:04:03.648
And so for the next eight years,

00:04:03.672 --> 00:04:07.230
I committed myself to doing stories
where you heard truths collide.

00:04:07.254 --> 00:04:09.394
We did stories
about the politics of consent,

00:04:09.418 --> 00:04:12.299
where you heard the perspective
of survivors and perpetrators

00:04:12.323 --> 00:04:13.530
whose narratives clashed.

00:04:13.554 --> 00:04:14.807
We did stories about race,

00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:17.457
how black men are systematically
eliminated from juries,

00:04:17.481 --> 00:04:20.305
and yet, the rules that try
and prevent that from happening

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.529
only make things worse.

00:04:21.553 --> 00:04:24.093
Stories about counter terrorism,
Guantanamo detainees,

00:04:24.117 --> 00:04:25.893
stories where everything is disputed,

00:04:25.917 --> 00:04:28.258
all you can do is struggle
to try and make sense.

00:04:28.282 --> 00:04:30.964
And this struggle
kind of became the point.

00:04:32.031 --> 00:04:34.427
I began to think, "Maybe that's my job."

00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:36.444
To lead people to moments of struggle.

00:04:37.015 --> 00:04:38.483
Here's what that sounded like:

00:04:38.507 --> 00:04:40.594
(Various voices) "But I see -- I, like --"

00:04:40.618 --> 00:04:41.919
"Uh, I --" (Sighs)

00:04:41.943 --> 00:04:43.935
"Well, so, like, huh --"

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:45.379
"That, I mean, I --"

00:04:45.403 --> 00:04:49.546
"You know -- golly -- I --" (Sighs)

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.355
JA: And that sigh right there,

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:55.119
I wanted to hear that sound
in every single story,

00:04:55.143 --> 00:04:58.176
because that sound
is kind of our current moment, right?

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.566
We live in a world where truth
is no longer just a set of facts

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.751
to be captured.

00:05:03.775 --> 00:05:04.942
It's become a process.

00:05:04.966 --> 00:05:07.312
It's gone from being a noun
to being a verb.

00:05:07.336 --> 00:05:09.419
But how do you end that story?

00:05:09.443 --> 00:05:13.300
Like, what literally kept happening
is we'd be, you know, telling a story,

00:05:13.324 --> 00:05:15.507
cruising along,
two viewpoints in conflict,

00:05:15.531 --> 00:05:18.229
you get to the end and it's just like --

00:05:18.253 --> 00:05:19.404
No, let me see.

00:05:19.428 --> 00:05:20.721
What do I say at the end?

00:05:20.745 --> 00:05:21.896
Oh, my God.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.951
What do you -- how do you end that story?

00:05:23.975 --> 00:05:25.745
You can't just happily-ever-after it,

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:27.277
because that doesn't feel real.

00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:28.451
At the same time,

00:05:28.475 --> 00:05:30.864
if you just leave people
in that stuck place,

00:05:30.888 --> 00:05:32.729
like, "Why did I just listen to that?"

00:05:32.753 --> 00:05:35.309
Like, it felt like there had to be
another move there.

00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:37.943
Had to be a way beyond the struggle.

00:05:37.967 --> 00:05:41.772
And this is what brings me to Dolly.

00:05:42.254 --> 00:05:44.777
Or Saint Dolly, as we like
to call her in the South.

00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:48.445
I want to tell you about one little
glimmer of an epiphany that I had,

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:51.631
doing a nine-part series
called "Dolly Parton's America" last year.

00:05:51.655 --> 00:05:53.336
It was a bit of a departure for me,

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.539
but I just had this intuition
that Dolly could help me

00:05:56.563 --> 00:05:58.316
figure out this ending problem.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.094
And here was the basic intuition:

00:06:00.118 --> 00:06:01.396
You go to a Dolly concert,

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.118
you see men in trucker hats
standing next to men in drag,

00:06:04.142 --> 00:06:06.031
Democrats standing next to Republicans,

00:06:06.055 --> 00:06:07.206
women holding hands,

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.483
every different kind of person
smashed together.

00:06:09.507 --> 00:06:12.372
All of these people that we are told
should hate each other

00:06:12.396 --> 00:06:14.126
are there singing together.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.570
She somehow carved out
this unique space in America,

00:06:17.594 --> 00:06:19.983
and I wanted to know, how did she do that?

00:06:20.007 --> 00:06:24.705
So I interviewed Dolly 12 times,
two separate continents.

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:26.500
She started every interview this way:

00:06:26.524 --> 00:06:28.864
(Audio) Dolly Parton: Ask me
whatever you ask me,

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:31.217
and I'm going to tell you
what I want you to hear.

00:06:31.231 --> 00:06:32.119
(Laughter)

00:06:32.143 --> 00:06:34.800
JA: She is undeniably a force of nature.

00:06:34.824 --> 00:06:37.102
But the problem that I ran into

00:06:37.126 --> 00:06:41.617
is that I had chosen
a conceit for this series

00:06:41.641 --> 00:06:44.054
that my soul had trouble with.

00:06:44.078 --> 00:06:46.014
Dolly sings a lot about the South.

00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:47.673
If you go through her discography,

00:06:47.697 --> 00:06:49.967
you will hear song after song
about Tennessee.

00:06:49.991 --> 00:06:52.879
(Music) DP: (Singing, various songs)
Tennessee, Tennessee...

00:06:52.903 --> 00:06:54.369
Tennessee homesick ...

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.617
I've got those Tennessee homesick blues
runnin' through my head.

00:07:00.682 --> 00:07:01.796
Tennessee.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.678
JA: "Tennessee Mountain Home,"
"Tennessee Mountain Memories."

00:07:04.682 --> 00:07:06.419
Now I grew up in Tennessee,

00:07:06.443 --> 00:07:08.459
and I felt no nostalgia for that place.

00:07:08.483 --> 00:07:11.478
I was the scrawny Arab kid

00:07:11.502 --> 00:07:14.784
who came from the place
that invented suicide bombing.

00:07:14.808 --> 00:07:17.069
I spent a lot of time in my room.

00:07:17.093 --> 00:07:18.689
When I left Nashville,

00:07:18.713 --> 00:07:20.848
I left.

00:07:20.872 --> 00:07:22.324
I remember being at Dollywood,

00:07:22.348 --> 00:07:26.149
standing in front of a replica,
replica of her Tennessee Mountain Home.

00:07:26.173 --> 00:07:27.912
People all around me were crying.

00:07:27.936 --> 00:07:30.309
This is a set.

00:07:30.705 --> 00:07:31.872
Why are you crying?

00:07:31.896 --> 00:07:34.185
I couldn't understand
why they were so emotional,

00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:36.759
especially given
my relationship to the South.

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:39.991
And I started to honestly have
panic attacks about this.

00:07:40.015 --> 00:07:42.154
"Am I not the right person
for this project?"

00:07:43.491 --> 00:07:44.641
But then ...

00:07:45.297 --> 00:07:46.447
twist of fate.

00:07:46.471 --> 00:07:48.301
We meet this guy, Bryan Seaver,

00:07:48.325 --> 00:07:50.562
Dolly's nephew and bodyguard.

00:07:50.586 --> 00:07:53.959
And on a whim, he drives
producer Shima Oliaee and I

00:07:53.983 --> 00:07:55.261
out of Dollywood,

00:07:55.285 --> 00:07:57.269
round the back side of the mountains,

00:07:57.293 --> 00:07:58.697
up the mountains 20 minutes,

00:07:58.721 --> 00:08:00.150
down a narrow dirt road,

00:08:00.174 --> 00:08:03.366
through giant wooden gates
that look right out of "Game of Thrones,"

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.921
and into the actual
Tennessee Mountain Home.

00:08:09.048 --> 00:08:10.397
But the real place.

00:08:10.421 --> 00:08:11.575
Valhalla.

00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:13.176
The real Tennessee Mountain Home.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.356
And I'm going to score
this part with Wagner,

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.007
because you've got to understand,

00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:18.197
in Tennessee lore,

00:08:18.221 --> 00:08:21.007
this is like hallowed ground,
the Tennessee Mountain Home.

00:08:21.031 --> 00:08:23.785
So I remember standing
there, on the grass,

00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:25.650
next to the Pigeon River,

00:08:25.674 --> 00:08:28.044
butterflies doing loopty loops in the air,

00:08:28.068 --> 00:08:30.334
and I had my own moment of wonder.

00:08:31.012 --> 00:08:33.758
Dolly's Tennessee Mountain Home

00:08:33.782 --> 00:08:37.545
looks exactly like my dad's home
in the mountains of Lebanon.

00:08:38.023 --> 00:08:41.705
Her house looks just like
the place that he left.

00:08:42.276 --> 00:08:45.575
And that simple bit of layering
led me to have a conversation with him

00:08:45.599 --> 00:08:46.857
that I'd never had before,

00:08:46.881 --> 00:08:48.991
about the pain he felt leaving his home.

00:08:49.015 --> 00:08:51.058
And how he hears that in Dolly's music.

00:08:51.082 --> 00:08:54.900
Then I had a conversation with Dolly
where she described her songs

00:08:54.924 --> 00:08:56.186
as migration music.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.098
Even that classic song,

00:08:58.122 --> 00:09:00.669
"Tennessee Mountain Home,"
if you listen to it --

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.571
(Dolly Parton "Tennessee Mountain Home")

00:09:03.595 --> 00:09:07.816
"Sittin' on the front porch
on a summer afternoon

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.324
In a straight-backed chair on two legs,

00:09:12.348 --> 00:09:15.888
leaned against the wall."

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:21.737
It's about trying to capture a moment
that you know is already gone.

00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:24.507
But if you can paint it, vividly,

00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:28.150
maybe you can freeze it in place,
almost like in resin,

00:09:28.174 --> 00:09:30.374
trapped between past and present.

00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:33.239
That is the immigrant experience.

00:09:33.801 --> 00:09:36.952
And that simple thought
led me to a million conversations.

00:09:36.976 --> 00:09:40.928
I started talking to musicologists
about country music as a whole.

00:09:40.952 --> 00:09:43.365
This genre that I've always felt so

00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:45.460
having nothing to do
with where I came from

00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:48.332
is actually made up of instruments
and musical styles

00:09:48.356 --> 00:09:50.285
that came directly from the Middle East.

00:09:50.309 --> 00:09:54.086
In fact, there were trade routes
that ran from what is now Lebanon

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.534
right up into the mountains
of East Tennessee.

00:09:57.007 --> 00:10:00.816
I can honestly say, standing there,
looking at her home,

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.967
was the first time I felt
like I'm a Tennessean.

00:10:04.957 --> 00:10:06.424
That is honestly true.

00:10:06.802 --> 00:10:08.489
And this wasn't a one-time thing,

00:10:08.513 --> 00:10:09.877
I mean, over and over again,

00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:13.830
she would force me
beyond the simple categories

00:10:13.854 --> 00:10:15.380
I had constructed for the world.

00:10:15.404 --> 00:10:18.225
I remember talking with her
about her seven-year partnership

00:10:18.249 --> 00:10:19.427
with Porter Wagoner.

00:10:19.451 --> 00:10:23.658
1967, she joins his band,
he is the biggest thing in country music,

00:10:23.682 --> 00:10:26.119
she is a backup singer, a nobody.

00:10:26.143 --> 00:10:28.602
Within a short time, she gets huge,

00:10:28.626 --> 00:10:29.785
he gets jealous,

00:10:29.809 --> 00:10:32.602
he then sues her for three million dollars

00:10:32.626 --> 00:10:33.840
when she tries to leave.

00:10:33.864 --> 00:10:36.785
Now it would be really easy
to see Porter Wagoner

00:10:36.809 --> 00:10:40.070
as, like, a type: classic,
patriarchal jackass,

00:10:40.094 --> 00:10:41.406
trying to hold her back.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.464
But any time I would suggest that to her,

00:10:43.488 --> 00:10:44.645
like, come on.

00:10:44.669 --> 00:10:47.495
(Audio) This is a guy, I mean,
you see it in the videos too,

00:10:47.519 --> 00:10:49.383
he's got his arm around you.

00:10:49.407 --> 00:10:53.343
There's a power thing happening, for sure.

00:10:53.367 --> 00:10:55.904
DP: Well, it's more complicated than that.

00:10:55.928 --> 00:10:57.689
I mean, just think about it.

00:10:57.713 --> 00:10:59.301
He had had this show for years,

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:02.451
he didn't need me to have his hit show.

00:11:02.475 --> 00:11:06.009
He wasn't expecting me
to be all that I was, either.

00:11:06.348 --> 00:11:09.312
I was a serious entertainer,
he didn't know that.

00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:12.586
He didn't know how many dreams I had.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.285
JA: In effect, she kept telling me,

00:11:14.309 --> 00:11:17.332
"Don't bring your stupid way
of seeing the world into my story,

00:11:17.356 --> 00:11:18.856
because that's not what it was.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.824
Yeah, there was power,
but that's not all there was.

00:11:21.848 --> 00:11:23.582
You can't summarize this."

00:11:25.501 --> 00:11:27.017
Alright, just to zoom out.

00:11:27.041 --> 00:11:28.318
What do I make of this?

00:11:28.342 --> 00:11:32.533
Well, I think there's something in here
that's a clue, a way forward.

00:11:32.557 --> 00:11:34.263
As journalists, we love difference.

00:11:34.287 --> 00:11:35.888
We love to fetishize difference.

00:11:35.912 --> 00:11:38.348
But increasingly, in this confusing world,

00:11:38.372 --> 00:11:41.213
we need to be the bridge
between those differences.

00:11:41.237 --> 00:11:42.770
But how do you do that?

00:11:43.261 --> 00:11:46.070
I think for me, now, the answer is simple.

00:11:46.094 --> 00:11:48.443
You interrogate those differences,

00:11:48.467 --> 00:11:50.991
you hold them for as long as you can,

00:11:51.015 --> 00:11:54.189
until, like up on that mountain,

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:55.414
something happens,

00:11:55.438 --> 00:11:57.105
something reveals itself.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.705
Story cannot end in difference.

00:11:59.729 --> 00:12:01.544
It's got to end in revelation.

00:12:02.277 --> 00:12:04.999
And coming back
from that trip on the mountain,

00:12:05.023 --> 00:12:08.435
a friend of mine gave me a book
that gave this whole idea a name.

00:12:08.856 --> 00:12:11.450
In psychotherapy,
there's this idea called the third,

00:12:11.474 --> 00:12:13.064
which essentially goes like this.

00:12:13.406 --> 00:12:16.667
Typically, we think of ourselves
as these autonomous units.

00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:19.356
I do something to you,
you do something to me.

00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:22.197
But according to this theory,
when two people come together

00:12:22.221 --> 00:12:24.769
and really commit to seeing each other,

00:12:24.793 --> 00:12:27.427
in that mutual act of recognition,

00:12:27.451 --> 00:12:29.539
they actually make something new.

00:12:29.563 --> 00:12:32.229
A new entity that is their relationship.

00:12:33.006 --> 00:12:37.095
You can think of Dolly's concerts
as sort of a cultural third space.

00:12:37.119 --> 00:12:39.825
The way she sees all the different
parts of her audience,

00:12:39.849 --> 00:12:41.039
the way they see her,

00:12:41.063 --> 00:12:43.927
creates the spiritual
architecture of that space.

00:12:45.293 --> 00:12:47.626
And I think now that is my calling.

00:12:48.237 --> 00:12:49.816
That as a journalist,

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.729
as a storyteller,

00:12:51.753 --> 00:12:53.681
as just an American,

00:12:53.705 --> 00:12:57.094
living in a country struggling to hold,

00:12:57.118 --> 00:13:00.094
that every story I tell
has got to find the third.

00:13:01.001 --> 00:13:04.342
That place where the things
we hold as different

00:13:04.366 --> 00:13:06.504
resolve themselves into something new.

00:13:07.792 --> 00:13:08.942
Thank you.
