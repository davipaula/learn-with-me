00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.834
In fact, I'm a science disseminator 
out of curiosity,

00:00:18.655 --> 00:00:21.256
that extreme curiosity

00:00:21.257 --> 00:00:24.827
in understanding the way nature works,

00:00:24.828 --> 00:00:28.727
our body, the universe, the brain,

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:33.904
these 87 billion of interconnected neurons

00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:37.455
that encode this strange behavior we have,

00:00:37.456 --> 00:00:41.395
that we don't know 
if we should follow reason or feelings.

00:00:41.396 --> 00:00:47.061
Science, actually, gives us 
a different perspective of the reality

00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:49.063
and opens up our minds

00:00:49.064 --> 00:00:52.298
and amazes us even 
in the most ordinary events.

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:56.541
In fact, one of the most 
revolutionary days

00:00:56.542 --> 00:00:59.269
in my career as a science disseminator

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.750
was at a neuroscience congress

00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:04.458
where, walking by the posters section,

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.598
I read the following work:

00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:16.502
"Clitoral stimulation induces 
Fos activation in the rat brain."

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:20.511
Sure, you keep staring at the poster

00:01:20.512 --> 00:01:23.666
and get closer to the researcher and say:

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:25.917
"Do you stimulate the rats' clitoris?"

00:01:25.926 --> 00:01:26.998
(Laughter)

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:29.126
"Yes, I do."

00:01:29.127 --> 00:01:30.599
"And how do you do it?"

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.128
"With a brush; I do three 
or four repetitions and stop.

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:35.798
Three or four repetitions and stop.

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.376
Because that is the way rats copulate."

00:01:38.377 --> 00:01:42.868
I kept thinking and she noticed
I was somewhat skeptical.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.043
And I said: "Hey, it is very important
that we investigate the sexual function.

00:01:47.044 --> 00:01:50.800
We, scientists, investigate the 
complete functioning of the body,

00:01:50.801 --> 00:01:53.495
why aren't we going to research
on sexuality?"

00:01:53.496 --> 00:01:55.283
I thought for a while, and it's true:

00:01:55.283 --> 00:01:57.993
after so much time working
as a communicator,

00:01:57.994 --> 00:02:00.264
Why haven't I written about sexuality?

00:02:00.265 --> 00:02:01.406
Out of taboo?

00:02:01.417 --> 00:02:04.626
The same taboo society has about sex,

00:02:04.627 --> 00:02:07.672
is shared by medicine and science.

00:02:08.098 --> 00:02:09.869
But she said something very curious:

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.162
"I study the hormones that encode desire.

00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:16.289
And I'm convinced about it
because neurophysiologically,

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.378
we are not that different from rats --

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.156
and it's true; psychologically, yes; 
but neurophysiologically, no --

00:02:22.156 --> 00:02:25.419
I'm convinced that behind that

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.211
there could also be an explanation

00:02:28.212 --> 00:02:32.977
for some male and female issues
related to desire.

00:02:32.978 --> 00:02:36.509
There are many sexual problems."

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.092
"More than you think," she told me.

00:02:39.093 --> 00:02:40.869
And I was wondering, is it true?

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:42.539
I searched for scientific material,

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:43.886
and, indeed,

00:02:45.346 --> 00:02:48.874
I found in "The Lancet,"

00:02:48.874 --> 00:02:51.049
one of the greatest science magazines,

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.492
data that show that approximately

00:02:53.493 --> 00:02:56.672
40 percent of men and more 
than 50 percent of women,

00:02:56.673 --> 00:02:58.668
even excepting old age,

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:00.095
at a certain moment

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:03.058
will have a problem related to sexuality.

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:06.910
Clearly, it was something
I had to investigate about.

00:03:07.522 --> 00:03:08.743
And where to start?

00:03:09.172 --> 00:03:11.479
To see the researcher then

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.402
and learn about all this hormone issue;

00:03:13.403 --> 00:03:15.415
testosterone and desire increase,

00:03:15.415 --> 00:03:19.374
dopamine and pleasure stimulation,

00:03:19.375 --> 00:03:20.981
prolactin and pleasure decrease,

00:03:20.982 --> 00:03:24.168
oxytocin segregated after orgasm

00:03:24.175 --> 00:03:26.584
is the love hormone keeping us together,

00:03:26.585 --> 00:03:29.654
but also, let's see something --
I teach you right now

00:03:29.654 --> 00:03:32.694
because, surely, 
you have never seen it before --

00:03:35.623 --> 00:03:36.958
(Laughter)

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.613
clitorial stimulation of rats.

00:03:39.613 --> 00:03:41.703
It's curious, because a lot of people say:

00:03:43.042 --> 00:03:45.709
"I had no idea rats had clitoris."

00:03:46.632 --> 00:03:48.341
And some women say:

00:03:48.342 --> 00:03:50.662
"Well, there are some men
that seem to ignore

00:03:50.662 --> 00:03:52.481
women have it too!!

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:53.501
(Laughter)

00:03:53.502 --> 00:03:56.541
But many of us don't know --

00:03:56.542 --> 00:03:59.242
I didn't know it, at least
when I started this research --

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.001
is that clitoris is much bigger
than we think.

00:04:03.002 --> 00:04:05.281
It is internal, in most of the cases;

00:04:05.282 --> 00:04:09.151
on the exterior, the glans
is like the tip of the iceberg

00:04:09.152 --> 00:04:14.702
Actually, these images you see in grey,
with a triangular shape,

00:04:15.501 --> 00:04:18.750
is the internal part of the clitoris,
it is like a penis,

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:21.759
that grows inside, has an erection

00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:27.540
and it is so big that gets closer 
to the front wall of the vagina

00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:30.374
and sometimes, you've heard about

00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:32.542
G spot...

00:04:32.542 --> 00:04:35.709
the G spot none of you know about;

00:04:35.721 --> 00:04:38.480
you know it's a spot that
generates more sexual arousal,

00:04:38.481 --> 00:04:39.750
but you don't know why.

00:04:39.751 --> 00:04:42.543
It is because the clitoris gets 
so close to the vagina

00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:46.990
that when you touch
2 to 3 centimeters upwards,

00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:49.450
you get in contact with its internal part,

00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:52.610
and, at that moment, pleasure increases.

00:04:52.611 --> 00:04:56.124
But truly, what is an orgasm?

00:04:56.125 --> 00:05:00.584
Orgasm, physiologically,

00:05:00.584 --> 00:05:04.634
is the activation of the sympathetic
nervous system.

00:05:04.634 --> 00:05:08.052
That is, to experience
sexual arousal, to be normal,

00:05:08.053 --> 00:05:10.334
we have a parasympathetic nervous system

00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:12.050
which keeps us relaxed.

00:05:12.051 --> 00:05:16.121
But during sexual arousal
there is a moment of explosion

00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:18.092
when the pupils dilate,

00:05:18.093 --> 00:05:19.959
the blood flows to the muscles,

00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:23.205
a series of secretions 
are released in the body

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:26.784
that activate this orgasmic response.

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:30.785
A piece of advice: for example,
now you know this,

00:05:31.402 --> 00:05:35.402
if you are having sexual intercourse
and someone groans with pleasure,

00:05:35.417 --> 00:05:39.401
but pupils are not dilated, 
there is no tachycardia,

00:05:39.402 --> 00:05:44.191
or no blushing of the upper part of 
the chest or chins,

00:05:44.192 --> 00:05:45.842
that person may be faking it.

00:05:46.398 --> 00:05:48.217
It's really important to know that,

00:05:48.218 --> 00:05:53.057
because these sympathetic nerves 
regulate the coming of the orgasm.

00:05:53.058 --> 00:05:56.928
For example, when someone is nervous
and has the fibers excited,

00:05:56.929 --> 00:05:59.228
has premature ejaculation.

00:05:59.228 --> 00:06:01.208
Or when wine relaxes us,

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:05.239
if we drink a lot of wine that slows down
the sympathetic nervous system,

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:07.277
women, particularly,

00:06:07.278 --> 00:06:09.973
take longer to reach orgasm.

00:06:09.973 --> 00:06:11.959
Or dominance and submission

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:15.583
that generate tension in the body
and facilitate orgasm.

00:06:15.584 --> 00:06:21.791
Or the tantra, that wonderful species 
of sexual behavior

00:06:21.791 --> 00:06:25.656
that allows the body to feel 
relaxed and excited at the same time

00:06:25.657 --> 00:06:27.390
and entirely sensitive.

00:06:28.207 --> 00:06:32.094
I had to move a step forward, because
eventually, when we talk about orgasm,

00:06:32.095 --> 00:06:35.163
people say: "Yes, they are clitoral 
or vaginal orgasms."

00:06:35.163 --> 00:06:36.961
Actually, they are all brain orgasms.

00:06:36.962 --> 00:06:41.772
The order to begin orgasm comes 
from the brain.

00:06:42.584 --> 00:06:44.502
I interviewed Barry Komisaruk.

00:06:44.503 --> 00:06:51.145
Barry Komisaruk is a researcher
of the Rutgers University

00:06:51.145 --> 00:06:55.467
who asked women to stimulate different
areas of their genitals

00:06:55.468 --> 00:07:00.238
to see which areas of their brains 
were activated in order to study

00:07:00.239 --> 00:07:01.663
the sexual response.

00:07:01.664 --> 00:07:05.526
It was really interesting, because 
he even saw different types of orgasms.

00:07:05.527 --> 00:07:08.344
If you haven't felt 
different kind of orgasms

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:10.899
it means you haven't experienced enough.

00:07:11.125 --> 00:07:14.258
Because they are real, different nerves
send the information

00:07:14.258 --> 00:07:17.815
from the internal part of the vagina, 
from the external part,

00:07:17.816 --> 00:07:19.496
so it is worth the exploration.

00:07:19.497 --> 00:07:21.419
But Barry told me something.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.142
He said: "I'm going to start
a research with men.

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:26.868
Would you like to be a volunteer?"

00:07:28.018 --> 00:07:32.099
And my first answer was: "No."

00:07:33.732 --> 00:07:38.358
And I realized this social restrain
we have regarding sex.

00:07:38.359 --> 00:07:40.993
I had taken part in a lot of studies;

00:07:40.994 --> 00:07:44.927
why did I repressed myself from
participation on a study on sexuality?

00:07:44.928 --> 00:07:46.777
So then I rebelled,

00:07:46.778 --> 00:07:50.329
and became the first man in the world

00:07:50.334 --> 00:07:54.751
having an orgasm under a functional
magnetic resonance imaging scan

00:07:54.752 --> 00:07:55.766
(Laughter)

00:07:55.766 --> 00:07:58.766
(Applause)

00:08:03.548 --> 00:08:05.969
And this is my brain

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:11.583
from the beginning of the stimulation 
to the end, and it was interesting

00:08:11.584 --> 00:08:13.876
as it perceived the areas that started;

00:08:13.876 --> 00:08:17.079
the limbic system, the hypothalamus,
the cortex.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.573
Well, in fact, a part of the brain cortex

00:08:20.574 --> 00:08:23.333
related to control,

00:08:23.334 --> 00:08:26.417
is the only one off during orgasm.

00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:28.684
All the rest of the brain was...

00:08:28.684 --> 00:08:32.957
is the activity that activates most areas
of the brain at the same time;

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.666
except for this cortex.

00:08:34.666 --> 00:08:40.793
And it was fantastic, 20 seconds later,
the brain was completely off.

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:44.962
And it is very similar to
what happened with women.

00:08:44.962 --> 00:08:48.716
Actually, the scans were the same; 
men and women.

00:08:48.717 --> 00:08:51.624
Men and women are more alike

00:08:51.625 --> 00:08:53.406
than we believe.

00:08:53.407 --> 00:08:55.998
There is much more diversity 
within the men group

00:08:55.998 --> 00:08:57.477
and within the women group,

00:08:57.478 --> 00:08:59.513
than in the opposite sex cases.

00:08:59.513 --> 00:09:04.035
But this takes place when we move forward
and take the psychological part

00:09:04.036 --> 00:09:07.714
and here comes the complexity,
because sexuality, indeed,

00:09:07.715 --> 00:09:11.251
has an endocrine, physiological,
neuroscientific,

00:09:11.252 --> 00:09:13.602
psychological and cultural side.

00:09:13.602 --> 00:09:17.014
And now, one of the most peculiar cases

00:09:17.014 --> 00:09:19.053
is the attraction.

00:09:19.054 --> 00:09:23.419
Why are we attracted to a certain person 
and not to another?

00:09:24.626 --> 00:09:26.377
Surely there is a biological aspect.

00:09:26.378 --> 00:09:28.894
It's said the symmetry is a beauty trait.

00:09:28.894 --> 00:09:32.386
Surely, there's a cultural part: 
in a culture, we like ones and others.

00:09:32.387 --> 00:09:34.344
But through experiments you realize

00:09:34.345 --> 00:09:37.982
that even, the emotional part
plays a relevant role.

00:09:37.983 --> 00:09:41.099
When we are sad,
we don't like the same people

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.050
than when we are happy.

00:09:43.691 --> 00:09:47.825
When you go to a party and feel 
the most attractive woman there,

00:09:47.826 --> 00:09:49.684
you'll check out certain kind of guys.

00:09:49.685 --> 00:09:55.176
If you are not that self confident,
and see other women you consider prettier,

00:09:55.177 --> 00:09:57.011
you will check out other guys.

00:09:57.012 --> 00:10:00.703
Even hunger affects your choices.

00:10:00.704 --> 00:10:03.630
And this is a very funny experiment.

00:10:03.631 --> 00:10:08.303
Half of the students were asked
to come to the experiment satisfied,

00:10:08.304 --> 00:10:11.448
after having eaten a lot.

00:10:11.449 --> 00:10:12.547
They had no idea.

00:10:12.548 --> 00:10:15.830
And other students came hungry, 
with a 10 hours fast.

00:10:16.235 --> 00:10:19.206
They were shown these images
of the same girl,

00:10:19.207 --> 00:10:24.041
but they distorted her shape
from a slimmer to a more plump body.

00:10:24.042 --> 00:10:25.698
And you know what?

00:10:25.698 --> 00:10:28.513
They were asked which they liked best.

00:10:28.514 --> 00:10:34.223
and the hungry group liked 
more plump figures.

00:10:35.265 --> 00:10:37.614
Our inner emotional state

00:10:37.615 --> 00:10:41.293
conditions our likes in each moment.

00:10:44.514 --> 00:10:48.083
Talking about attraction, 
there is a very important issue.

00:10:48.083 --> 00:10:53.693
If I tell you, we should respect 
any sexual diversity

00:10:53.694 --> 00:10:55.155
it's rather obvious.

00:10:55.156 --> 00:10:57.428
A lot more people say so.

00:10:57.429 --> 00:11:00.566
But, I had a question from 
a scientific point of view

00:11:00.566 --> 00:11:03.312
which is valid from that approach.

00:11:03.313 --> 00:11:05.946
Can the sexual orientation be changed?

00:11:05.947 --> 00:11:10.862
It's absurd, we know that, to ask people
to try to change their nature,

00:11:10.863 --> 00:11:12.406
but, is it possible?

00:11:12.407 --> 00:11:17.258
And I ran into this scientific study
from 1968

00:11:17.258 --> 00:11:20.259
where it was intended,
through electroshocks,

00:11:20.259 --> 00:11:23.193
and aversive chemical therapy,

00:11:23.194 --> 00:11:26.455
when they were watching homosexual images,

00:11:26.459 --> 00:11:28.621
to change gays' sexual orientation.

00:11:28.622 --> 00:11:32.007
And I interviewed, since he's still alive,
the author, John Bancroft,

00:11:32.008 --> 00:11:33.959
once the director of Kings Institute.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.142
You know what he said?
It was quite revealing.

00:11:36.142 --> 00:11:39.658
He said, "We, at that time -- 
now we know it's atrocious --

00:11:39.659 --> 00:11:42.125
but we thought we were doing them a favor,

00:11:42.126 --> 00:11:46.361
because at that time, homosexuality
was not approved and they suffered a lot

00:11:46.362 --> 00:11:48.321
and we thought we could change them.

00:11:48.321 --> 00:11:49.411
You know what?

00:11:49.411 --> 00:11:52.527
Despite their intentions,
and electroshocks,

00:11:52.527 --> 00:11:54.841
aversive therapy, they didn't change.

00:11:55.562 --> 00:12:00.524
And the ones who tried it,
bore a great suffering for not changing.

00:12:01.022 --> 00:12:03.272
So, the conclusion is pretty obvious:

00:12:03.272 --> 00:12:06.288
the ones to be cured are not homosexuals.

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:07.918
The ones are homophobes.

00:12:07.926 --> 00:12:09.121
(Applause)

00:12:09.122 --> 00:12:10.180
We...

00:12:10.181 --> 00:12:12.935
(Applause)

00:12:12.936 --> 00:12:14.072
Thank you.

00:12:14.073 --> 00:12:15.588
(Applause)

00:12:19.708 --> 00:12:23.017
It is essential to accept diversity

00:12:23.018 --> 00:12:25.937
and we have to be the first ones 
to accept it.

00:12:25.938 --> 00:12:30.358
For instance, each person lives sexuality
as desired.

00:12:31.152 --> 00:12:34.713
Kiko is a boy who uses a wheelchair.

00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:37.212
And has no sensitivity in his genitals.

00:12:37.213 --> 00:12:40.901
I'm treated as if I were asexual;
as if I had no desire,

00:12:40.902 --> 00:12:43.896
and of course I have it, 
of course I get aroused,

00:12:43.897 --> 00:12:46.735
and of course I have 
a different sexuality."

00:12:46.736 --> 00:12:51.300
Actually, Kiko is a very sexual person,
who has his partners.

00:12:51.301 --> 00:12:52.817
Opposite to Rebeca;

00:12:52.818 --> 00:12:56.265
she is asexual and has no desire.

00:12:56.266 --> 00:12:58.911
She has never felt desire;
not even as a teenager,

00:12:58.912 --> 00:13:04.527
and she doesn't feel attracted to anybody
either, neither boys nor girls.

00:13:04.528 --> 00:13:06.489
This is called an asexual person.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.608
And Rebeca told me: "And you know what?
I'm really happy."

00:13:09.609 --> 00:13:12.939
But the key is not about having
more or less sex,

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:18.211
it's about having the sex quantity
and quality you want.

00:13:18.212 --> 00:13:20.063
That's the important thing.

00:13:20.931 --> 00:13:25.577
Then, we get into this
scientific-sexual adventure

00:13:25.578 --> 00:13:27.878
into something even more complicated.

00:13:27.879 --> 00:13:31.532
The couple; it's not about one but two.

00:13:31.533 --> 00:13:36.849
And here there is a constant interplay
between nature and culture.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:42.512
Because if we look at our nature,
we do have a monogamy tendency,

00:13:42.513 --> 00:13:44.208
since we are primates --

00:13:44.209 --> 00:13:48.835
actually, in this aspect, we are 
more similar to birds than to cats --

00:13:48.836 --> 00:13:54.114
because our offspring needs
both progenitors

00:13:54.115 --> 00:13:55.562
to survive.

00:13:55.563 --> 00:13:59.781
That's why nature has codified monogamy;

00:13:59.782 --> 00:14:03.095
that is, the tendency to fall in love 
and have a couple.

00:14:03.095 --> 00:14:04.685
Monogamy is natural.

00:14:04.686 --> 00:14:07.865
But not fidelity.

00:14:07.865 --> 00:14:11.376
There is no animal species that is 
faithful to a partner, even birds,

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.524
that are such a romantic couple.

00:14:13.525 --> 00:14:16.555
If they get lost, when going for food

00:14:16.556 --> 00:14:20.742
and find better genes, they definitely
take the most of it.

00:14:20.751 --> 00:14:24.740
So, here we have the culture pressure

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:26.688
in our relationships with a partner.

00:14:26.688 --> 00:14:31.458
And it's ok, we have to obey culture
not biology.

00:14:31.459 --> 00:14:33.918
But, there are people

00:14:33.919 --> 00:14:38.170
who start looking for other couple models,

00:14:38.171 --> 00:14:41.680
they look for broadening this behavior

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.162
to polyamory or swinging

00:14:45.163 --> 00:14:47.877
in order to adapt them to their needs.

00:14:47.878 --> 00:14:51.651
I, after all this adventure, realized that

00:14:52.125 --> 00:14:55.084
there are five steps to have 
a complete sexual life.

00:14:55.085 --> 00:14:58.656
The first one, to eliminate traumas.

00:14:59.817 --> 00:15:02.869
Possibly, most of you have no traumas,

00:15:02.869 --> 00:15:05.934
but the ones who unconsciously have them

00:15:05.934 --> 00:15:09.024
and are a little haunted 
and not fully aware of them,

00:15:09.024 --> 00:15:11.834
should have a psychological cleanse.

00:15:11.837 --> 00:15:13.983
Be at ease with yourselves.

00:15:13.984 --> 00:15:15.539
Then, health.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.545
People always ask me:
"Is sex good for health?"

00:15:18.546 --> 00:15:23.708
I say: "Yes, but health 
has to be good for sex."

00:15:23.709 --> 00:15:26.700
That is, the cardiovascular 
and the nervous system,

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:30.710
they have to be in very good condition
to have satisfying sexual intercourses.

00:15:30.711 --> 00:15:34.214
Then, after knowing yourself;
self awareness seems a cliché

00:15:34.215 --> 00:15:37.249
but I mean knowing how our body works

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.996
and also our couple;

00:15:38.997 --> 00:15:42.872
men have the feeling that they
already know a lot of themselves, and...

00:15:42.873 --> 00:15:43.974
No, no, no.

00:15:43.975 --> 00:15:45.799
We have to know ourselves better.

00:15:45.792 --> 00:15:50.209
With these three things: psychological
cleanse, health and self-awareness,

00:15:50.207 --> 00:15:53.240
we have a satisfactory sex life.

00:15:53.241 --> 00:15:57.112
Now, if we want to have
a great sex life,

00:15:57.113 --> 00:16:03.393
it's the turn to open our minds,
read, explore,

00:16:03.394 --> 00:16:06.900
and, finally, experiment.

00:16:07.938 --> 00:16:11.251
I wish you a joyful sex life

00:16:11.252 --> 00:16:15.531
and, above all, enjoy science 
and knowledge as well.

00:16:15.532 --> 00:16:16.771
Thank you very much.

00:16:16.772 --> 00:16:18.422
(Applause)
