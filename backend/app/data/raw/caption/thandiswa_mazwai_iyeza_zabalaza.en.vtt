00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.360
(Applause)

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.936
Thandiswa Mazwai: Hello everybody.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.616
Thank you so much for having us here.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.440
My name is Thandiswa Mazwai.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.200
I am a wild woman,
a rebel singer, a conduit.

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:33.216
My music is about memory

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.360
and struggling between
oppresion and freedom.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.096
After over 20 years in South Africa

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.520
we find ourselves as the black masses

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.560
still suffering and fighting
for our freedom and humanity.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.480
This first song was called "Iyeza"
which means "medicine."

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.240
Medicine for our madness,
medicine for our rage.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.376
This song we're doing now
is called "Zabalaza,"

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.200
and it means "rebel."

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.576
I'd like to dedicate this to the valiant
student movement in South Africa

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.816
who came up with the #FeesMustFall.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.936
(Applause)

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.296
Rhodes Must Fall.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.296
(Applause)

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.896
But more importantly,

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.896
the new vigor that has been brought
into the feminist movement

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.440
so patriarchy must fall.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.016
(Applause)

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.840
(Music)

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.080
Gogo bek' umthwalo

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.280
Kunin' uhlupheka?

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.336
Little ghetto child

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.720
Ungazibulali sana

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.720
Oh ...

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.960
If you take my hand,

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.976
I'll show you

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.336
how to be free.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:37.296
Ayifanelang' ub' iyenzeka lento

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.240
Emzini kabawo

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.760
kunge kudala

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.376
Sizozabalaza.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.456
Zabalaza, zabalaza.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.736
Zabalaza.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.336
Sizozabalaza.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.880
Zabalaza, zabalaza.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.800
Zabalaza.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.216
Zabalaza, zabalaza.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.376
Zabalaza.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.816
Zabalaza.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.216
Zabalaza.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.440
Zabalaza.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.120
(Vocalizing)

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.760
(Improvising)

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:57.360
It's my people in Soweto,

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.920
my people in Mozambique,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.600
my people in Senegal.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.520
These are my people in the ghettos.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.936
Zabalaza, zabalaza.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.480
Zabalaza.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.960
Zabalaza.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.336
(Music ends)

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.296
(Applause)

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.696
(Cheering)

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.936
Thank you very much.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.560
(Applause)
