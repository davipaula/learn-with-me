00:00:06.983 --> 00:00:10.684
As the story goes, 
the legendary marksman William Tell

00:00:10.684 --> 00:00:15.430
was forced into a cruel challenge
by a corrupt lord.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.652
William's son was to be executed

00:00:17.652 --> 00:00:21.959
unless William could shoot 
an apple off his head.

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:26.933
William succeeded, but let's imagine
two variations on the tale.

00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.573
In the first variation,

00:00:28.573 --> 00:00:33.070
the lord hires a bandit to steal
William's trusty crossbow,

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.341
so he is forced to borrow
an inferior one from a peasant.

00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:41.357
However, the borrowed crossbow
isn't adjusted perfectly,

00:00:41.357 --> 00:00:43.446
and William finds that his practice shots

00:00:43.446 --> 00:00:47.752
cluster in a tight spread 
beneath the bullseye.

00:00:47.752 --> 00:00:52.608
Fortunately, he has time 
to correct for it before it's too late.

00:00:52.608 --> 00:00:54.372
Variation two:

00:00:54.372 --> 00:00:58.805
William begins to doubt his skills
in the long hours before the challenge

00:00:58.805 --> 00:01:01.502
and his hand develops a tremor.

00:01:01.502 --> 00:01:04.619
His practice shots still cluster
around the apple

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.677
but in a random pattern.

00:01:06.677 --> 00:01:08.732
Occasionally, he hits the apple,

00:01:08.732 --> 00:01:12.619
but with the wobble,
there is no guarantee of a bullseye.

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.512
He must settle his nervous hand

00:01:14.512 --> 00:01:19.201
and restore the certainty in his aim
to save his son.

00:01:19.201 --> 00:01:23.639
At the heart of these variations
are two terms often used interchangeably:

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:26.369
accuracy and precision.

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.942
The distinction between the two

00:01:27.942 --> 00:01:31.517
is actually critical 
for many scientific endeavours.

00:01:31.517 --> 00:01:35.501
Accuracy involves how close you come
to the correct result.

00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:39.636
Your accuracy improves with tools
that are calibrated correctly

00:01:39.636 --> 00:01:42.013
and that you're well-trained on.

00:01:42.013 --> 00:01:43.714
Precision, on the other hand,

00:01:43.714 --> 00:01:48.212
is how consistently you can get 
that result using the same method.

00:01:48.212 --> 00:01:52.034
Your precision improves 
with more finely incremented tools

00:01:52.034 --> 00:01:54.511
that require less estimation.

00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:59.327
The story of the stolen crossbow
was one of precision without accuracy.

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:02.888
William got the same wrong result
each time he fired.

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:08.065
The variation with the shaky hand
was one of accuracy without precision.

00:02:08.065 --> 00:02:11.241
William's bolts clustered 
around the correct result,

00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:15.449
but without certainty of a bullseye
for any given shot.

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:18.179
You can probably get away 
with low accuracy

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:21.076
or low precision in everyday tasks.

00:02:21.076 --> 00:02:24.580
But engineers and researchers
often require accuracy

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.262
on microscopic levels with 
a high certainty of being right every time.

00:02:30.262 --> 00:02:32.772
Factories and labs increase precision

00:02:32.772 --> 00:02:36.333
through better equipment 
and more detailed procedures.

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:39.170
These improvements can be expensive,
so managers must decide

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.013
what the acceptable uncertainty 
for each project is.

00:02:44.013 --> 00:02:46.098
However, investments in precision

00:02:46.098 --> 00:02:49.317
can take us beyond 
what was previously possible,

00:02:49.317 --> 00:02:51.532
even as far as Mars.

00:02:51.532 --> 00:02:54.551
It may surprise you that NASA
does not know exactly where

00:02:54.551 --> 00:02:58.535
their probes are going to touch down
on another planet.

00:02:58.535 --> 00:03:02.484
Predicting where they will land
requires extensive calculations

00:03:02.484 --> 00:03:06.247
fed by measurements 
that don't always have a precise answer.

00:03:06.247 --> 00:03:11.254
How does the Martian atmosphere's density
change at different elevations?

00:03:11.254 --> 00:03:14.049
What angle will the probe
hit the atmosphere at?

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.227
What will be the speed 
of the probe upon entry?

00:03:17.227 --> 00:03:20.764
Computer simulators run thousands
of different landing scenarios,

00:03:20.764 --> 00:03:24.391
mixing and matching values
for all of the variables.

00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:26.058
Weighing all the possibilities,

00:03:26.058 --> 00:03:29.439
the computer spits out 
the potential area of impact

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.840
in the form of a landing ellipse.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.528
In 1976, the landing ellipse
for the Mars Viking Lander

00:03:37.528 --> 00:03:44.336
was 62 x 174 miles,
nearly the area of New Jersey.

00:03:44.336 --> 00:03:45.918
With such a limitation,

00:03:45.918 --> 00:03:50.608
NASA had to ignore many interesting
but risky landing areas.

00:03:50.608 --> 00:03:53.975
Since then, new information 
about the Martian atmosphere,

00:03:53.975 --> 00:03:56.451
improved spacecraft technology,

00:03:56.451 --> 00:04:02.333
and more powerful computer simulations
have drastically reduced uncertainty.

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:06.186
In 2012, the landing ellipse 
for the Curiosity Lander

00:04:06.186 --> 00:04:10.046
was only 4 miles wide by 12 miles long,

00:04:10.046 --> 00:04:14.251
an area more than 200 times 
smaller than Viking's.

00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:18.492
This allowed NASA to target 
a specific spot in Gale Crater,

00:04:18.492 --> 00:04:23.341
a previously un-landable area 
of high scientific interest.

00:04:23.341 --> 00:04:26.199
While we ultimately strive for accuracy,

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.480
precision reflects our certainty
of reliably achieving it.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.501
With these two principles in mind,

00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:34.202
we can shoot for the stars

00:04:34.202 --> 00:04:37.121
and be confident 
of hitting them every time.
