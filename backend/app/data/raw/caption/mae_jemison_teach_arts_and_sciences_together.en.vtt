00:00:18.725 --> 00:00:22.377
What I want to do today is spend
some time talking about some stuff

00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:25.986
that's giving me a little bit
of existential angst,

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.306
for lack of a better word,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.416
over the past couple of years.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.668
And basically, these three quotes
tell what's going on.

00:00:34.692 --> 00:00:37.956
"When God made the color purple,
God was just showing off,"

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.499
Alice Walker wrote in "The Color Purple."

00:00:40.523 --> 00:00:44.306
And Zora Neale Hurston wrote
in "Dust Tracks On A Road,"

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.156
"Research is a formalized curiosity.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.832
It's poking and prying with a purpose."

00:00:50.274 --> 00:00:52.767
And then finally,
when I think about the near future,

00:00:52.791 --> 00:00:56.073
we have this attitude, "Well,
whatever happens, happens."

00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:57.258
Right?

00:00:57.282 --> 00:00:59.820
So that goes along with
the Cheshire Cat saying,

00:00:59.844 --> 00:01:02.202
"If you don't care much
where you want to get to,

00:01:02.226 --> 00:01:04.368
it doesn't much matter which way you go."

00:01:04.392 --> 00:01:08.686
But I think it does matter which way
we go and what road we take,

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.554
because when I think
about design in the near future,

00:01:11.578 --> 00:01:13.885
what I think are the most
important issues,

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.882
what's really crucial and vital,

00:01:15.906 --> 00:01:20.692
is that we need to revitalize
the arts and sciences right now,

00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:22.220
in 2002.

00:01:22.673 --> 00:01:25.364
(Applause)

00:01:27.182 --> 00:01:31.548
If we describe the near future
as 10, 20, 15 years from now,

00:01:31.572 --> 00:01:35.391
that means that what we do today
is going to be critically important,

00:01:35.415 --> 00:01:39.396
because in the year 2015,
in the year 2020, 2025,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.090
the world our society
is going to be building on,

00:01:42.114 --> 00:01:44.586
the basic knowledge and abstract ideas,

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.711
the discoveries
that we came up with today,

00:01:47.735 --> 00:01:50.699
just as all these wonderful things
we're hearing about

00:01:50.723 --> 00:01:51.979
here at the TED conference

00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:54.790
that we take for granted
in the world right now,

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:57.377
were really knowledge
and ideas that came up

00:01:57.401 --> 00:01:59.728
in the 50s, the 60s and the 70s.

00:02:00.176 --> 00:02:02.557
That's the substrate
that we're exploiting today.

00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:03.905
Whether it's the internet,

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:05.772
genetic engineering, laser scanners,

00:02:05.796 --> 00:02:09.045
guided missiles, fiber optics,
high-definition television,

00:02:09.984 --> 00:02:14.165
remote sensing from space
and the wonderful remote-sensing photos

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:18.996
that we see in 3D weaving, TV programs
like Tracker and Enterprise,

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.415
CD-rewrite drives, flat-screen,
Alvin Ailey's "Suite Otis,"

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.020
or Sarah Jones's "Your Revolution Will
Not [Happen] Between These Thighs,"

00:02:27.044 --> 00:02:29.014
which, by the way, was banned by the FCC,

00:02:29.038 --> 00:02:30.189
or ska --

00:02:30.213 --> 00:02:34.489
all of these things, without question,
almost without exception,

00:02:34.513 --> 00:02:38.269
are really based on ideas
and abstract and creativity

00:02:38.293 --> 00:02:39.884
from years before.

00:02:39.908 --> 00:02:41.378
So we have to ask ourselves:

00:02:41.402 --> 00:02:44.411
What are we contributing
to that legacy right now?

00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:45.988
And when I think about it,

00:02:46.012 --> 00:02:47.166
I'm really worried.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.319
To be quite frank, I'm concerned.

00:02:49.343 --> 00:02:52.162
I'm skeptical that we're doing
very much of anything.

00:02:52.593 --> 00:02:54.356
We're, in a sense,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.006
failing to act in the future.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.189
We're purposefully,
consciously being laggards.

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:01.648
We're lagging behind.

00:03:02.097 --> 00:03:05.055
Frantz Fanon, who was a psychiatrist
from Martinique, said,

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.001
"Each generation must,
out of relative obscurity,

00:03:08.025 --> 00:03:09.719
discover its mission

00:03:09.743 --> 00:03:11.804
and fulfill or betray it."

00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:15.663
What is our mission?
What do we have to do?

00:03:15.687 --> 00:03:19.159
I think our mission is
to reconcile, to reintegrate

00:03:19.183 --> 00:03:21.532
science and the arts,

00:03:21.556 --> 00:03:26.283
because right now, there's a schism
that exists in popular culture.

00:03:26.307 --> 00:03:30.553
People have this idea that science
and the arts are really separate;

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:32.930
we think of them as separate
and different things.

00:03:32.954 --> 00:03:36.139
And this idea was probably
introduced centuries ago,

00:03:36.163 --> 00:03:38.220
but it's really becoming critical now,

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.567
because we're making decisions
about our society every day

00:03:43.591 --> 00:03:48.800
that, if we keep thinking that the arts
are separate from the sciences,

00:03:48.824 --> 00:03:50.681
and we keep thinking it's cute to say,

00:03:50.705 --> 00:03:52.777
"I don't understand
anything about this one,

00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:55.182
I don't understand anything
about the other one,"

00:03:55.206 --> 00:03:56.858
then we're going to have problems.

00:03:56.882 --> 00:03:58.921
Now, I know no one
here at TED thinks this.

00:03:58.945 --> 00:04:01.561
All of us, we already know
that they're very connected.

00:04:01.585 --> 00:04:04.780
But I'm going to let you know
that some folks in the outside world,

00:04:04.804 --> 00:04:07.148
believe it or not,
think it's neat when they say,

00:04:07.172 --> 00:04:10.442
"Scientists and science is not creative.

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:13.332
Maybe scientists are ingenious,
but they're not creative."

00:04:13.803 --> 00:04:15.296
And then we have this tendency,

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.844
the career counselors
and various people say things

00:04:17.868 --> 00:04:20.481
like, "Artists are not analytical.

00:04:20.505 --> 00:04:22.176
They're ingenious, perhaps,

00:04:23.109 --> 00:04:24.447
but not analytical."

00:04:25.401 --> 00:04:27.783
And when these concepts
underlie our teaching

00:04:27.807 --> 00:04:29.703
and what we think about the world,

00:04:29.727 --> 00:04:31.053
then we have a problem,

00:04:31.077 --> 00:04:33.187
because we stymie support for everything.

00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:34.831
By accepting this dichotomy,

00:04:34.855 --> 00:04:36.966
whether it's tongue-in-cheek,

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.531
when we attempt
to accommodate it in our world,

00:04:39.555 --> 00:04:41.910
and we try to build
our foundation for the world,

00:04:41.934 --> 00:04:43.472
we're messing up the future,

00:04:43.496 --> 00:04:45.864
because: Who wants to be uncreative?

00:04:46.394 --> 00:04:48.084
Who wants to be illogical?

00:04:48.108 --> 00:04:50.172
Talent would run
from either of these fields

00:04:50.196 --> 00:04:51.969
if you said you had to choose either.

00:04:51.993 --> 00:04:54.206
Then they'll go to something
where they think,

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.836
"Well, I can be creative
and logical at the same time."

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.523
Now, I grew up in the '60s
and I'll admit it --

00:04:59.547 --> 00:05:02.599
actually, my childhood spanned the '60s,

00:05:02.623 --> 00:05:04.273
and I was a wannabe hippie,

00:05:04.297 --> 00:05:08.822
and I always resented the fact
that I wasn't old enough to be a hippie.

00:05:08.846 --> 00:05:11.717
And I know there are people here,
the younger generation,

00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:13.205
who want to be hippies.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.283
People talk about the '60s all the time.

00:05:15.307 --> 00:05:17.514
And they talk about the anarchy
that was there.

00:05:17.538 --> 00:05:19.134
But when I think about the '60s,

00:05:19.158 --> 00:05:22.896
what I took away from it was
that there was hope for the future.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.970
We thought everyone could participate.

00:05:24.994 --> 00:05:29.019
There were wonderful, incredible ideas
that were always percolating,

00:05:29.043 --> 00:05:32.081
and so much of what's cool or hot today

00:05:32.105 --> 00:05:34.153
is really based on some of those concepts,

00:05:34.177 --> 00:05:37.717
whether it's people trying to use
the Prime Directive from Star Trek,

00:05:37.741 --> 00:05:39.588
being involved in things,

00:05:39.612 --> 00:05:42.678
or, again, that three-dimensional
weaving and fax machines

00:05:42.702 --> 00:05:44.560
that I read about in my weekly readers

00:05:44.584 --> 00:05:47.511
that the technology and engineering
was just getting started.

00:05:47.535 --> 00:05:49.291
But the '60s left me with a problem.

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:53.960
You see, I always assumed
I would go into space,

00:05:53.984 --> 00:05:55.650
because I followed all of this.

00:05:55.674 --> 00:05:58.473
But I also loved the arts and sciences.

00:05:58.497 --> 00:06:01.621
You see, when I was growing up
as a little girl and as a teenager,

00:06:01.645 --> 00:06:04.100
I loved designing and making doll clothes

00:06:04.124 --> 00:06:05.915
and wanting to be a fashion designer.

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:07.237
I took art and ceramics.

00:06:07.261 --> 00:06:12.853
I loved dance: Lola Falana,
Alvin Ailey, Jerome Robbins.

00:06:13.442 --> 00:06:17.587
And I also avidly followed
the Gemini and the Apollo programs.

00:06:17.611 --> 00:06:20.978
I had science projects
and tons of astronomy books.

00:06:21.002 --> 00:06:22.612
I took calculus and philosophy.

00:06:22.636 --> 00:06:26.372
I wondered about infinity
and the Big Bang theory.

00:06:26.396 --> 00:06:29.603
And when I was at Stanford,
I found myself, my senior year,

00:06:29.627 --> 00:06:30.933
chemical engineering major,

00:06:30.957 --> 00:06:34.489
half the folks thought I was a political
science and performing arts major,

00:06:34.513 --> 00:06:37.752
which was sort of true, because I was
Black Student Union President,

00:06:37.776 --> 00:06:39.553
and I did major in some other things.

00:06:39.577 --> 00:06:41.261
And I found myself the last quarter

00:06:41.285 --> 00:06:43.690
juggling chemical engineering
separation processes,

00:06:43.714 --> 00:06:46.892
logic classes, nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy,

00:06:46.916 --> 00:06:50.437
and also producing and choreographing
a dance production.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.590
And I had to do the lighting
and the design work,

00:06:53.614 --> 00:06:55.898
and I was trying to figure out:

00:06:55.922 --> 00:06:59.157
Do I go to New York City
to try to become a professional dancer,

00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:00.839
or to go to medical school?

00:07:00.863 --> 00:07:03.100
Now, my mother helped
me figure that one out.

00:07:03.124 --> 00:07:06.219
(Laughter)

00:07:06.243 --> 00:07:10.897
But when I went into space,
I carried a number of things up with me.

00:07:10.921 --> 00:07:12.699
I carried a poster by Alvin Ailey --

00:07:12.723 --> 00:07:15.166
you can figure out now,
I love the dance company --

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.570
an Alvin Ailey poster of Judith Jamison
performing the dance "Cry,"

00:07:18.594 --> 00:07:20.631
dedicated to all black women everywhere;

00:07:20.655 --> 00:07:24.394
a Bundu statue, which was from
the women's society in Sierra Leone;

00:07:24.418 --> 00:07:27.057
and a certificate for the Chicago
Public School students

00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:30.234
to work to improve their science and math.

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:32.195
And folks asked me,

00:07:32.816 --> 00:07:35.066
"Why did you take up what you took up?"

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:36.863
And I had to say,

00:07:36.887 --> 00:07:39.440
"Because it represents human creativity;

00:07:39.464 --> 00:07:41.911
the creativity that allowed us,

00:07:41.935 --> 00:07:44.861
that we were required to have
to conceive and build and launch

00:07:44.885 --> 00:07:46.051
the space shuttle,

00:07:46.075 --> 00:07:49.183
which springs from the same source
as the imagination and analysis

00:07:49.207 --> 00:07:51.304
that it took to carve a Bundu statue,

00:07:51.328 --> 00:07:56.644
or the ingenuity it took to design,
choreograph and stage "Cry."

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.842
Each one of them are different
manifestations, incarnations,

00:08:00.866 --> 00:08:04.662
of creativity --
avatars of human creativity.

00:08:05.114 --> 00:08:07.468
And that's what we have to
reconcile in our minds,

00:08:07.492 --> 00:08:08.946
how these things fit together.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:13.344
The difference between arts and sciences
is not analytical versus intuitive.

00:08:13.368 --> 00:08:14.519
Right?

00:08:14.543 --> 00:08:18.335
E = mc2 required an intuitive leap,

00:08:18.359 --> 00:08:20.699
and then you had to do
the analysis afterwards.

00:08:21.514 --> 00:08:22.832
Einstein said, in fact,

00:08:22.856 --> 00:08:25.020
"The most beautiful thing
we can experience

00:08:25.044 --> 00:08:26.348
is the mysterious.

00:08:26.372 --> 00:08:29.174
It is the source
of all true art and science."

00:08:29.673 --> 00:08:32.618
Dance requires us to express
and want to express

00:08:32.642 --> 00:08:33.809
the jubilation in life,

00:08:33.833 --> 00:08:35.412
but then you have to figure out:

00:08:35.436 --> 00:08:36.853
Exactly what movement do I do

00:08:36.877 --> 00:08:38.994
to make sure it comes across correctly?

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:40.958
The difference between arts and sciences

00:08:40.982 --> 00:08:44.499
is also not constructive
versus deconstructive.

00:08:44.523 --> 00:08:47.182
A lot of people think of the sciences
as deconstructive,

00:08:47.206 --> 00:08:48.807
you have to pull things apart.

00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:51.893
And yeah, subatomic physics
is deconstructive --

00:08:51.917 --> 00:08:54.521
you literally try to tear atoms apart

00:08:54.545 --> 00:08:56.581
to understand what's inside of them.

00:08:56.605 --> 00:09:00.156
But sculpture, from what I understand
from great sculptors,

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.361
is deconstructive,

00:09:01.385 --> 00:09:04.706
because you see a piece and you remove
what doesn't need to be there.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.497
Biotechnology is constructive.

00:09:07.006 --> 00:09:09.457
Orchestral arranging is constructive.

00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:12.592
So, in fact, we use constructive
and deconstructive techniques

00:09:12.616 --> 00:09:13.771
in everything.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.739
The difference
between science and the arts

00:09:17.763 --> 00:09:21.194
is not that they are different sides
of the same coin, even,

00:09:21.218 --> 00:09:23.516
or even different parts
of the same continuum,

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.911
but rather, they're manifestations
of the same thing.

00:09:27.499 --> 00:09:30.297
Different quantum states of an atom?

00:09:30.321 --> 00:09:32.368
Or maybe if I want to be
more 21st century,

00:09:32.392 --> 00:09:35.800
I could say that they're different
harmonic resonances of a superstring.

00:09:35.824 --> 00:09:37.168
But we'll leave that alone.

00:09:37.192 --> 00:09:38.870
They spring from the same source.

00:09:39.384 --> 00:09:42.602
The arts and sciences are avatars
of human creativity.

00:09:42.626 --> 00:09:44.102
It's our attempt as humans

00:09:44.126 --> 00:09:47.603
to build an understanding
of the universe, the world around us.

00:09:47.627 --> 00:09:50.133
It's our attempt to influence things,

00:09:50.157 --> 00:09:52.288
the universe internal to ourselves

00:09:52.312 --> 00:09:53.807
and external to us.

00:09:53.831 --> 00:09:59.437
The sciences, to me, are manifestations
of our attempt to express or share

00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:02.149
our understanding, our experience,

00:10:02.173 --> 00:10:05.007
to influence the universe
external to ourselves.

00:10:05.412 --> 00:10:08.143
It doesn't rely on us as individuals.

00:10:08.167 --> 00:10:10.977
It's the universe,
as experienced by everyone.

00:10:11.577 --> 00:10:13.906
The arts manifest our desire,

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.237
our attempt to share or influence others

00:10:16.261 --> 00:10:19.875
through experiences
that are peculiar to us as individuals.

00:10:20.719 --> 00:10:22.267
Let me say it again another way:

00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:26.716
science provides an understanding
of a universal experience,

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.956
and arts provide a universal understanding

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.879
of a personal experience.

00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:34.867
That's what we have to think about,

00:10:34.891 --> 00:10:37.801
that they're all part of us,
they're all part of a continuum.

00:10:37.825 --> 00:10:41.027
It's not just the tools,
it's not just the sciences,

00:10:41.051 --> 00:10:44.025
the mathematics and the numerical stuff
and the statistics,

00:10:44.049 --> 00:10:46.094
because we heard, very much on this stage,

00:10:46.118 --> 00:10:48.537
people talked about music
being mathematical.

00:10:49.923 --> 00:10:51.546
Arts don't just use clay,

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:54.751
aren't the only ones that use clay,
light and sound and movement.

00:10:55.776 --> 00:10:59.497
They use analysis as well.

00:10:59.973 --> 00:11:01.136
So people might say,

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.043
"Well, I still like that intuitive
versus analytical thing,"

00:11:04.067 --> 00:11:07.098
because everybody wants to do
the right brain, left brain thing.

00:11:07.122 --> 00:11:10.011
We've all been accused of being
right-brained or left-brained

00:11:10.035 --> 00:11:11.195
at some point in time,

00:11:11.219 --> 00:11:13.039
depending on who we disagreed with.

00:11:13.063 --> 00:11:14.387
(Laughter)

00:11:14.411 --> 00:11:16.305
You know, people say "intuitive" --

00:11:16.329 --> 00:11:18.264
that's like you're in touch with nature,

00:11:18.288 --> 00:11:20.273
in touch with yourself and relationships;

00:11:20.297 --> 00:11:22.530
analytical, you put your mind to work.

00:11:22.554 --> 00:11:25.623
I'm going to tell you a little secret.
You all know this, though.

00:11:25.647 --> 00:11:27.746
But sometimes people use
this analysis idea,

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.602
that things are outside of ourselves,

00:11:29.626 --> 00:11:33.080
to say, this is what
we're going to elevate

00:11:33.104 --> 00:11:36.158
as the true, most important
sciences, right?

00:11:36.182 --> 00:11:39.641
Then you have artists -- and you all know
this is true as well --

00:11:39.665 --> 00:11:42.976
artists will say things about scientists

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.036
because they say they're too concrete,
they're disconnected from the world.

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.638
But, we've even had that here on stage,

00:11:49.662 --> 00:11:52.403
so don't act like you don't know
what I'm talking about.

00:11:52.427 --> 00:11:53.621
(Laughter)

00:11:53.645 --> 00:11:55.985
We had folks talking
about the Flat Earth Society

00:11:56.009 --> 00:11:57.184
and flower arrangers,

00:11:57.208 --> 00:11:59.122
so there's this whole dichotomy

00:11:59.146 --> 00:12:02.083
that we continue to carry along,
even when we know better.

00:12:02.841 --> 00:12:05.444
And folks say we need to choose either-or.

00:12:06.492 --> 00:12:09.398
But it would really be foolish
to choose either one,

00:12:09.422 --> 00:12:11.436
intuitive versus analytical.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.647
That's a foolish choice.

00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:17.174
It's foolish just like trying to choose
between being realistic or idealistic.

00:12:17.198 --> 00:12:18.743
You need both in life.

00:12:19.167 --> 00:12:20.323
Why do people do this?

00:12:20.347 --> 00:12:23.052
I'm going to quote
a molecular biologist, Sydney Brenner,

00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:24.959
who's 70 years old, so he can say this.

00:12:24.983 --> 00:12:28.196
He said, "It's always important
to distinguish between chastity

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.444
and impotence."

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.015
Now --

00:12:31.039 --> 00:12:33.142
(Laughter)

00:12:33.166 --> 00:12:38.976
I want to share with you
a little equation, OK?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.197
How does understanding science
and the arts fit into our lives

00:12:44.221 --> 00:12:45.376
and what's going on

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.503
and the things we're talking about
here at the design conference?

00:12:48.527 --> 00:12:50.605
And this is a little thing I came up with:

00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:51.796
understanding

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.663
and our resources and our will

00:12:54.174 --> 00:12:55.485
cause us to have outcomes.

00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:58.593
Our understanding is our science,
our arts, our religion;

00:12:58.617 --> 00:13:00.952
how we see the universe around us;

00:13:00.976 --> 00:13:03.673
our resources, our money,
our labor, our minerals --

00:13:03.697 --> 00:13:06.861
those things that are out there
in the world we have to work with.

00:13:06.885 --> 00:13:08.861
But more importantly, there's our will.

00:13:09.532 --> 00:13:10.701
This is our vision,

00:13:10.725 --> 00:13:13.314
our aspirations of the future,
our hopes, our dreams,

00:13:13.338 --> 00:13:14.719
our struggles and our fears.

00:13:14.743 --> 00:13:18.442
Our successes and our failures influence
what we do with all of those.

00:13:18.466 --> 00:13:22.587
And to me, design and engineering,
craftsmanship and skilled labor,

00:13:22.611 --> 00:13:25.785
are all the things that work
on this to have our outcome,

00:13:25.809 --> 00:13:27.617
which is our human quality of life.

00:13:28.397 --> 00:13:30.373
Where do we want the world to be?

00:13:30.776 --> 00:13:31.943
And guess what?

00:13:31.967 --> 00:13:33.615
Regardless of how we look at this,

00:13:33.639 --> 00:13:36.596
whether we look at arts and sciences
as separate or different,

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.845
they're both being influenced now
and they're both having problems.

00:13:39.869 --> 00:13:41.958
I did a project called
S.E.E.ing the Future:

00:13:41.982 --> 00:13:43.679
Science, Engineering and Education.

00:13:43.703 --> 00:13:45.409
It was looking at how to shed light

00:13:45.433 --> 00:13:47.702
on the most effective use
of government funding.

00:13:47.726 --> 00:13:50.592
We got a bunch of scientists
in all stages of their careers.

00:13:50.616 --> 00:13:53.114
They came to Dartmouth College,
where I was teaching.

00:13:53.138 --> 00:13:55.774
And they talked about,
with theologians and financiers:

00:13:55.798 --> 00:13:57.923
What are some of the issues
of public funding

00:13:57.947 --> 00:13:59.771
for science and engineering research?

00:13:59.795 --> 00:14:01.396
What's most important about it?

00:14:02.068 --> 00:14:03.672
There are some ideas that emerged

00:14:03.696 --> 00:14:06.344
that I think have really
powerful parallels to the arts.

00:14:06.368 --> 00:14:08.868
The first thing they said
was that the circumstances

00:14:08.892 --> 00:14:12.290
that we find ourselves in today
in the sciences and engineering

00:14:12.314 --> 00:14:13.893
that made us world leaders

00:14:13.917 --> 00:14:19.174
are very different than the '40s,
the '50s, and the '60s and the '70s,

00:14:19.198 --> 00:14:20.810
when we emerged as world leaders,

00:14:20.834 --> 00:14:23.287
because we're no longer
in competition with fascism,

00:14:23.311 --> 00:14:24.706
with Soviet-style communism.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:28.102
And by the way, that competition
wasn't just military;

00:14:28.126 --> 00:14:32.559
it included social competition
and political competition as well,

00:14:32.583 --> 00:14:36.191
that allowed us to look at space
as one of those platforms

00:14:36.215 --> 00:14:38.556
to prove that our social
system was better.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.897
Another thing they talked
about was that the infrastructure

00:14:41.921 --> 00:14:43.266
that supports the sciences

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.588
is becoming obsolete.

00:14:44.612 --> 00:14:47.108
We look at universities and colleges --

00:14:47.132 --> 00:14:50.290
small, mid-sized community colleges
across the country --

00:14:50.314 --> 00:14:52.728
their laboratories are becoming obsolete.

00:14:52.752 --> 00:14:55.402
And this is where we train
most of our science workers

00:14:55.426 --> 00:14:58.660
and our researchers --
and our teachers, by the way.

00:14:58.684 --> 00:15:03.437
And there's a media that doesn't support
the dissemination of any more than

00:15:03.461 --> 00:15:06.349
the most mundane and inane of information.

00:15:06.373 --> 00:15:09.791
There's pseudoscience, crop circles,
alien autopsy, haunted houses,

00:15:09.815 --> 00:15:11.033
or disasters.

00:15:11.057 --> 00:15:12.431
And that's what we see.

00:15:12.455 --> 00:15:15.778
This isn't really the information you need
to operate in everyday life

00:15:15.802 --> 00:15:18.194
and figure out how to participate
in this democracy

00:15:18.218 --> 00:15:19.920
and determine what's going on.

00:15:19.944 --> 00:15:22.709
They also said there's a change
in the corporate mentality.

00:15:22.733 --> 00:15:24.895
Whereas government money
had always been there

00:15:24.919 --> 00:15:27.010
for basic science
and engineering research,

00:15:27.034 --> 00:15:30.796
we also counted on some companies
to do some basic research.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.641
But what's happened now
is companies put more energy

00:15:33.665 --> 00:15:36.200
into short-term product development

00:15:36.967 --> 00:15:40.175
than they do in basic engineering
and science research.

00:15:41.738 --> 00:15:44.413
And education is not keeping up.

00:15:44.437 --> 00:15:48.096
In K through 12, people
are taking out wet labs.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.196
They think if we put
a computer in the room,

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:53.492
it's going to take the place
of actually mixing the acids

00:15:53.516 --> 00:15:55.015
or growing the potatoes.

00:15:55.039 --> 00:15:57.347
And government funding
is decreasing in spending,

00:15:57.371 --> 00:16:00.166
and then they're saying,
let's have corporations take over,

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:01.346
and that's not true.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:04.556
Government funding
should at least do things

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:08.511
like recognize cost benefits
of basic science and engineering research.

00:16:08.535 --> 00:16:11.628
We have to know that we have
a responsibility as global citizens

00:16:11.652 --> 00:16:12.810
in this world.

00:16:12.834 --> 00:16:14.880
We have to look at
the education of humans.

00:16:14.904 --> 00:16:18.239
We need to build our resources today
to make sure that they're trained

00:16:18.263 --> 00:16:20.637
so they understand
the importance of these things.

00:16:20.661 --> 00:16:23.885
And we have to support
the vitality of science.

00:16:23.909 --> 00:16:27.832
That doesn't mean that everything has
to have one thing that's going to go on,

00:16:27.856 --> 00:16:30.730
or that we know exactly what's going
to be the outcome of it,

00:16:30.754 --> 00:16:33.813
but that we support the vitality
and the intellectual curiosity

00:16:33.837 --> 00:16:35.085
that goes along [with it].

00:16:35.109 --> 00:16:37.632
And if you think about
those parallels to the arts --

00:16:37.656 --> 00:16:41.726
the competition
with the Bolshoi Ballet spurred

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.999
the Joffrey and the New York
City Ballet to become better.

00:16:45.023 --> 00:16:49.225
Infrastructure, museums, theaters,
movie houses across the country

00:16:49.249 --> 00:16:50.401
are disappearing.

00:16:50.425 --> 00:16:52.864
We have more television stations
with less to watch,

00:16:52.888 --> 00:16:56.647
we have more money spent on rewrites

00:16:56.671 --> 00:16:58.556
to get old television programs

00:16:58.580 --> 00:16:59.937
in the movies.

00:17:00.731 --> 00:17:03.103
We have corporate funding now that,

00:17:03.127 --> 00:17:06.488
when it goes to support the arts,

00:17:06.512 --> 00:17:09.691
it almost requires that the product
be part of the picture

00:17:09.715 --> 00:17:11.012
that the artist draws.

00:17:11.036 --> 00:17:14.941
We have stadiums that are named
over and over again by corporations.

00:17:14.965 --> 00:17:18.747
In Houston, we're trying to figure out
what to do with that Enron Stadium thing.

00:17:18.771 --> 00:17:19.790
(Laughter)

00:17:19.814 --> 00:17:22.695
Fine arts and education
in the schools is disappearing,

00:17:22.719 --> 00:17:26.449
And we have a government
that seems like it's gutting the NEA

00:17:26.473 --> 00:17:27.636
and other programs.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.759
So we have to really stop and think:

00:17:29.783 --> 00:17:32.815
What are we trying to do
with the sciences and the arts?

00:17:32.839 --> 00:17:34.712
There's a need to revitalize them.

00:17:34.736 --> 00:17:36.307
We have to pay attention to it.

00:17:36.331 --> 00:17:39.088
I just want to tell you quickly
what I'm doing --

00:17:39.421 --> 00:17:45.301
(Applause)

00:17:46.369 --> 00:17:49.777
I want to tell you what I've been doing
a little bit since ...

00:17:50.318 --> 00:17:53.760
I feel this need to sort of
integrate some of the ideas

00:17:53.784 --> 00:17:56.184
that I've had and run across over time.

00:17:56.208 --> 00:18:00.556
One of the things that I found out
is that there's a need to repair

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.143
the dichotomy between the mind
and body as well.

00:18:03.167 --> 00:18:05.816
My mother always told me,
you have to be observant,

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.082
know what's going on
in your mind and your body.

00:18:08.106 --> 00:18:11.780
And as a dancer, I had this tremendous
faith in my ability to know my body,

00:18:11.804 --> 00:18:13.780
just as I knew how to sense colors.

00:18:14.286 --> 00:18:15.945
Then I went to medical school,

00:18:16.627 --> 00:18:20.818
and I was supposed to just go on
what the machine said about bodies.

00:18:20.842 --> 00:18:24.390
You know, you would ask patients questions
and some people would tell you,

00:18:24.414 --> 00:18:26.322
"Don't listen to what the patient said."

00:18:26.346 --> 00:18:29.290
We know that patients know
and understand their bodies better,

00:18:29.314 --> 00:18:32.824
but these days we're trying
to divorce them from that idea.

00:18:32.848 --> 00:18:36.740
We have to reconcile
the patient's knowledge of their body

00:18:36.764 --> 00:18:38.357
with physicians' measurements.

00:18:39.658 --> 00:18:42.575
We had someone talk about
measuring emotions

00:18:42.599 --> 00:18:46.556
and getting machines to figure out
what to keep us from acting crazy.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.745
No, we shouldn't measure.

00:18:48.769 --> 00:18:51.078
We shouldn't use machines
to measure road rage

00:18:51.102 --> 00:18:53.611
and then do something to keep
us from engaging in it.

00:18:53.635 --> 00:18:57.603
Maybe we can have machines help us
to recognize that we have road rage,

00:18:57.627 --> 00:19:00.808
and then we need to know
how to control that without the machines.

00:19:00.832 --> 00:19:04.093
We even need to be able to recognize that
without the machines.

00:19:04.117 --> 00:19:06.619
What I'm very concerned about is:

00:19:06.643 --> 00:19:12.292
How do we bolster our self-awareness
as humans, as biological organisms?

00:19:12.316 --> 00:19:15.125
Michael Moschen spoke of having to teach

00:19:15.149 --> 00:19:19.726
and learn how to feel with my eyes,
to see with my hands.

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:23.737
We have all kinds of possibilities
to use our senses by,

00:19:23.761 --> 00:19:25.910
and that's what we have to do.

00:19:25.934 --> 00:19:27.765
That's what I want to do --

00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:31.166
to try to use bioinstrumentation,
those kind of things,

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:34.275
to help our senses in what we do.

00:19:34.299 --> 00:19:36.018
That's the work I've been doing now,

00:19:36.042 --> 00:19:38.104
as a company called
BioSentient Corporation.

00:19:38.128 --> 00:19:41.051
I figured I'd have to do that ad,
because I'm an entrepreneur,

00:19:41.075 --> 00:19:45.226
and "entrepreneur" says "somebody
who does what they want to do,

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.427
because they're not broke enough
that they have to get a real job."

00:19:48.451 --> 00:19:49.453
(Laughter)

00:19:49.477 --> 00:19:52.067
But that's the work I'm doing,
BioSentient Corporation,

00:19:52.091 --> 00:19:54.687
trying to figure out:
How do we integrate these things?

00:19:54.711 --> 00:19:59.388
Let me finish by saying that
my personal design issue for the future

00:19:59.412 --> 00:20:01.374
is really about integrating;

00:20:01.398 --> 00:20:04.215
to think about that intuitive
and that analytical.

00:20:04.239 --> 00:20:06.544
The arts and sciences are not separate.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.860
High school physics
lesson before you leave:

00:20:09.884 --> 00:20:12.274
high school physics teacher
used to hold up a ball.

00:20:12.298 --> 00:20:15.018
She would say, "This ball
has potential energy.

00:20:15.042 --> 00:20:17.545
But nothing will happen to it,
it can't do any work,

00:20:17.569 --> 00:20:19.616
until I drop it and it changes states."

00:20:20.411 --> 00:20:23.068
I like to think of ideas
as potential energy.

00:20:23.092 --> 00:20:24.928
They're really wonderful,

00:20:24.952 --> 00:20:29.222
but nothing will happen
until we risk putting them into action.

00:20:29.246 --> 00:20:33.037
This conference is filled
with wonderful ideas.

00:20:33.452 --> 00:20:35.959
We're going to share
lots of things with people.

00:20:35.983 --> 00:20:37.696
But nothing's going to happen

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.838
until we risk putting
those ideas into action.

00:20:40.862 --> 00:20:43.590
We need to revitalize
the arts and sciences today.

00:20:43.614 --> 00:20:46.109
We need to take responsibility
for the future.

00:20:46.133 --> 00:20:49.757
We can't hide behind saying
it's just for company profits,

00:20:49.781 --> 00:20:51.008
or it's just a business,

00:20:51.032 --> 00:20:53.277
or I'm an artist or an academician.

00:20:54.039 --> 00:20:56.071
Here's how you judge what you're doing:

00:20:56.095 --> 00:20:59.556
I talked about that balance
between intuitive, analytical.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.388
Fran Lebowitz, my favorite cynic,

00:21:03.412 --> 00:21:05.995
said, "The three questions
of greatest concern ..." --

00:21:06.019 --> 00:21:07.886
now I'm going to add on to design --

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:10.086
"... are: Is it attractive?"

00:21:11.299 --> 00:21:12.993
That's the intuitive.

00:21:13.017 --> 00:21:15.608
"Is it amusing?" -- the analytical,

00:21:15.632 --> 00:21:18.317
and, "Does it know
its place?" -- the balance.

00:21:18.341 --> 00:21:19.513
Thank you very much.

00:21:19.537 --> 00:21:22.195
(Applause)
