00:00:12.355 --> 00:00:14.782
Greg Gage: It's an age-old
pursuit of all parents,

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:16.808
getting their kids
to eat their vegetables.

00:00:16.832 --> 00:00:18.881
But getting them to eat
cookies or ice cream

00:00:18.905 --> 00:00:20.056
is relatively easy,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.321
and that's because our brains
prefer sweetness.

00:00:22.345 --> 00:00:24.760
Now, there's a new technology
called optogenetics

00:00:24.784 --> 00:00:26.806
which may be able to trick our taste buds,

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.443
for instance preferring
vegetables over sweets.

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:32.084
We're going to try this today
using fruit flies.

00:00:32.108 --> 00:00:34.752
[DIY Neuroscience]

00:00:35.086 --> 00:00:37.196
The reason why we experiment
with fruit flies

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.231
is they have a small enough nervous system

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:42.497
that gives us a fighting chance
to really understand what's going on.

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:45.600
And believe it or not, their taste buds
are very similar to ours.

00:00:45.624 --> 00:00:48.283
But before we try to manipulate
their taste preferences,

00:00:48.307 --> 00:00:51.161
we need to establish:
What is the baseline of the fruit fly?

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:52.336
What does it prefer?

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.248
We call this a control experiment.

00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:56.475
Spencer's been hard at work doing this.

00:00:56.499 --> 00:00:58.563
OK, Spencer, let's do
our first experiment.

00:00:58.587 --> 00:01:01.881
We want to test to see if fruit flies
prefer bananas or broccoli.

00:01:01.905 --> 00:01:03.452
So what do we need?

00:01:03.476 --> 00:01:07.073
Spencer Brown: So we need the fly pad,
which is basically an iPad for flies.

00:01:07.097 --> 00:01:08.280
It measures the touch.

00:01:08.304 --> 00:01:09.940
GG: You put a fly in each chamber?

00:01:10.288 --> 00:01:13.187
SB: Yeah. Inside, we'll offer them
banana and broccoli

00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:14.597
to see which one they prefer.

00:01:14.621 --> 00:01:16.400
GG: In order to count how many times

00:01:16.424 --> 00:01:18.902
the fruit fly eats a banana
versus the broccoli,

00:01:18.926 --> 00:01:21.638
these chambers have been outfitted
with a small electrode

00:01:21.662 --> 00:01:23.252
that sends data to a computer.

00:01:23.276 --> 00:01:26.418
And so what were your findings
on banana versus broccoli?

00:01:26.442 --> 00:01:28.979
SB: I found that the flies
visited banana the most.

00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:30.927
GG: Both were there, but like most kids,

00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:35.234
they choose not to eat the broccoli,
and they go switch to something sweeter.

00:01:35.258 --> 00:01:37.440
GG: Now a quick background
on how taste works.

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:39.645
Taste buds are made up
of specialized neurons

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:40.837
called taste receptors.

00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:43.511
When we eat something
that triggers a particular taste,

00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:46.034
those taste neurons will fire
a signal to the brain.

00:01:46.058 --> 00:01:48.978
This allows our brain to know
what's sweet and what's bitter.

00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:52.338
So when a fruit fly eats a banana,
its sweet taste neurons will fire.

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:55.843
But when it eats broccoli,
those same neurons stay pretty quiet.

00:01:55.867 --> 00:01:58.841
But what if we could force
those sweet-tasting neurons to fire

00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:00.731
every time the fruit fly eats broccoli?

00:02:00.755 --> 00:02:02.473
We may be able to get the fruit fly

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:04.244
to like broccoli as much as banana.

00:02:04.268 --> 00:02:05.505
Enter optogenetics.

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:08.901
This is the revolutionary new tool
that's taking neuroscience by storm,

00:02:08.925 --> 00:02:11.243
and in this case, "opto" means light

00:02:11.267 --> 00:02:14.798
and "genetic" refers to the fact
that these fruit flies have been modified

00:02:14.822 --> 00:02:18.647
to contain a special gene that makes
only certain neurons respond to light.

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:22.365
In our case, we've added the special gene
to the sweet taste receptors.

00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:23.916
Now here's the fun part.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.994
Optogenetics means that we
can control these special neurons

00:02:27.018 --> 00:02:29.627
whenever they're exposed
to a bright-colored light,

00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:31.840
causing them to send
messages to the brain.

00:02:31.864 --> 00:02:35.003
In this experiment, we're going to have
these modified fruit flies

00:02:35.027 --> 00:02:37.042
choose between banana and broccoli again,

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:39.907
only this time, every time
the fruit fly eats the broccoli,

00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:42.122
we're going to trigger
a big bright red light.

00:02:42.146 --> 00:02:45.296
And when the channels see that red light,
they're going to open up,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.460
and they're going to cause
that neuron to fire,

00:02:47.484 --> 00:02:50.008
and the sweet taste message
will be sent to the brain.

00:02:50.032 --> 00:02:51.276
How do you get them out?

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.674
SB: So we're going to be using
a mouth aspirator,

00:02:53.698 --> 00:02:55.539
so it's just two straws put together.

00:02:55.563 --> 00:02:57.372
GG: So it's a fancy name for a straw.

00:02:57.396 --> 00:02:58.547
SB: Basically.

00:02:58.571 --> 00:03:00.399
GG: So you're going to suck those out.

00:03:01.822 --> 00:03:03.654
Have you ever sucked up a fly before?

00:03:03.678 --> 00:03:05.597
SB: Once or twice.

00:03:10.432 --> 00:03:12.082
GG: There we go. You got all four.

00:03:12.106 --> 00:03:13.257
OK, perfect.

00:03:13.281 --> 00:03:15.701
So you're going to turn on
your OptoStimmers here.

00:03:15.725 --> 00:03:18.859
You're going to park the light
right on top of the chambers.

00:03:18.883 --> 00:03:21.708
So now we sit here and we wait
for them to eat broccoli,

00:03:21.732 --> 00:03:23.692
and then when the light fires,

00:03:23.716 --> 00:03:26.231
they're going to think
it's tasting something sweet.

00:03:26.255 --> 00:03:28.217
Come on. Oh, he's getting closer.

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:30.169
Come on. It tastes good now.

00:03:30.193 --> 00:03:31.343
SB: It's about to.

00:03:31.736 --> 00:03:33.244
GG: Oh, he's back. All right!

00:03:33.268 --> 00:03:36.562
All right, so now we see
that some of these flies

00:03:36.586 --> 00:03:39.411
are switching over from
the banana to the broccoli.

00:03:39.435 --> 00:03:40.601
SB: Exactly, yeah.

00:03:40.625 --> 00:03:42.308
GG: Every time this light goes off,

00:03:42.332 --> 00:03:45.119
that means that they think
they're tasting something sweet.

00:03:45.143 --> 00:03:47.314
SB: Yeah. So this guy's
really going after it.

00:03:47.338 --> 00:03:49.512
GG: So we saw that we were able
to rescue broccoli

00:03:49.536 --> 00:03:52.409
and make it just as appealing
as banana to our fruit flies.

00:03:52.433 --> 00:03:54.687
And we're able to replicate
these same results

00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:56.044
in all of our experiments.

00:03:56.068 --> 00:03:58.668
So the question is: Can we
do the same thing in humans?

00:03:58.692 --> 00:04:00.597
Well, that depends on a number of items.

00:04:00.621 --> 00:04:04.083
First, do optogenetic tools
even work in humans?

00:04:04.107 --> 00:04:06.110
And that looks like the answer is yes,

00:04:06.134 --> 00:04:08.716
and in fact, clinical trials
are already being planned

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.270
that will treat chronic pain
and blindness using optogenetics.

00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:15.285
And the next question is,
can we easily trigger a light source

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:17.833
so that every time we eat
vegetables, it will go off?

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:21.295
For that, I'm afraid at least
at this time, the answer is still no.

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:24.648
But today, we got to witness
just a taste of optogenetics

00:04:24.672 --> 00:04:26.086
and its amazing potential.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.523
