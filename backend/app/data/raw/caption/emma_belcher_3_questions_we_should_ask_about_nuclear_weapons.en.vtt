00:00:13.496 --> 00:00:16.391
So you know when
you're doubled over in pain

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:18.613
and you're wondering, is it your appendix

00:00:18.637 --> 00:00:20.353
or maybe you ate something funny?

00:00:21.472 --> 00:00:25.185
Well, when that happens to me,
I call my friend Sasha --

00:00:25.209 --> 00:00:26.376
Sasha is a doctor --

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.096
and I say, "Should I rush
to the nearest emergency room

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.491
in a panic?

00:00:30.515 --> 00:00:33.813
Or am I OK to relax and just wait it out?"

00:00:33.837 --> 00:00:36.900
Yes, I am that annoying friend.

00:00:39.011 --> 00:00:41.416
But in September 2017,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.726
friends of mine were suddenly calling me

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.305
for my professional opinion.

00:00:47.868 --> 00:00:49.630
And no, I'm not a doctor,

00:00:49.654 --> 00:00:52.209
but they were asking me
questions of life and death.

00:00:53.444 --> 00:00:56.519
So what was going on in September of 2017?

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.806
Well, North Korea was suddenly
and scarily all over the news.

00:01:02.752 --> 00:01:04.997
Kim Jong-un had tested missiles

00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:08.943
potentially capable of hitting
major US cities,

00:01:08.967 --> 00:01:12.862
and President Trump had responded
with tweets of "fire and fury."

00:01:14.097 --> 00:01:18.161
And there was real concern
that tensions would escalate

00:01:18.185 --> 00:01:19.661
to a potential war

00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:21.993
or even nuclear weapons use.

00:01:23.067 --> 00:01:25.821
So what my friends
were calling and asking was:

00:01:25.845 --> 00:01:29.297
Should they panic or were the OK to relax?

00:01:30.615 --> 00:01:34.813
But really, they were asking me
a fundamental question:

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.059
"Am I safe?"

00:01:40.396 --> 00:01:44.872
While I was reassuring them that,
no, they didn't need to worry just yet,

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:47.015
the irony of their question dawned on me.

00:01:48.094 --> 00:01:51.043
What they hadn't really thought about

00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:54.814
is that we've all been living
under a much larger cloud for decades --

00:01:54.838 --> 00:01:56.964
potentially a mushroom cloud --

00:01:56.988 --> 00:01:58.748
without giving it much thought.

00:02:00.114 --> 00:02:02.194
Now it's not surprising
that friends of mine

00:02:02.218 --> 00:02:05.249
and many others like them
don't know much about nuclear weapons

00:02:05.273 --> 00:02:06.813
and don't think about them.

00:02:06.837 --> 00:02:09.756
After all, the end of the Cold War,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.611
the United States and Russia,
tension abated,

00:02:13.635 --> 00:02:15.507
we started dismantling nuclear weapons,

00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:18.554
and they started to become
a relic of the past.

00:02:19.177 --> 00:02:22.329
Generations didn't have to grow up
with the specter of nuclear war

00:02:22.353 --> 00:02:23.558
hanging over their heads.

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:28.884
And there other reasons people don't like
to think about nuclear weapons.

00:02:28.908 --> 00:02:31.358
It's scary, overwhelming.

00:02:31.382 --> 00:02:32.725
I get it.

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:35.916
Sometimes I wish I could have chosen
a cheerier field to study.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.986
(Laughter)

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.240
Perhaps tax law would
have been more uplifting.

00:02:39.264 --> 00:02:40.755
(Laughter)

00:02:42.557 --> 00:02:44.812
But in addition to that,

00:02:44.836 --> 00:02:48.224
people have so many other things
to think about in their busy lives,

00:02:48.248 --> 00:02:51.034
and they'd much prefer to think
about something over which

00:02:51.058 --> 00:02:53.710
they feel they have
some semblance of control,

00:02:53.734 --> 00:02:57.273
and they assume that other people,
smarter than they on this topic,

00:02:57.297 --> 00:02:59.726
are working away to keep us all safe.

00:03:01.317 --> 00:03:04.658
And then, there are other reasons
people don't talk about this,

00:03:04.682 --> 00:03:07.468
and one is because we, as nuclear experts,

00:03:07.492 --> 00:03:10.863
use a whole lot of convoluted
jargon and terminology

00:03:10.887 --> 00:03:12.482
to talk about these issues:

00:03:13.227 --> 00:03:16.834
CVID, ICBM, JCPOA.

00:03:17.782 --> 00:03:20.909
It's really inaccessible
for a lot of people.

00:03:21.678 --> 00:03:25.312
And, in reality, it actually sometimes
I think makes us numb

00:03:25.336 --> 00:03:27.614
to what we're really talking about here.

00:03:28.843 --> 00:03:31.494
And what we are really talking about here

00:03:31.518 --> 00:03:32.669
is the fact that,

00:03:32.693 --> 00:03:35.933
while we've made dramatic reductions
in the number of nuclear weapons

00:03:35.957 --> 00:03:37.344
since the Cold War,

00:03:37.368 --> 00:03:42.693
right now, there are almost 15,000
in the world today.

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:45.463
15,000.

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.403
The United States and Russia have
over 90 percent of these nuclear weapons.

00:03:53.034 --> 00:03:56.422
If you're wondering, these are
the countries that have the rest.

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:59.074
But they have far fewer,

00:03:59.098 --> 00:04:02.272
ranging in the sort of
300-ish range and below.

00:04:05.112 --> 00:04:08.678
Adding to this situation is the fact
that we have new technologies

00:04:08.702 --> 00:04:11.154
that potentially bring us new challenges.

00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:17.250
Could you imagine, one day,
countries like ours and others

00:04:17.274 --> 00:04:21.932
potentially ceding decisions
about a nuclear strike to a robot,

00:04:22.688 --> 00:04:24.789
based on algorithms?

00:04:24.813 --> 00:04:27.432
And what data do they use
to inform those algorithms?

00:04:28.438 --> 00:04:30.145
This is pretty terrifying.

00:04:31.098 --> 00:04:35.820
So adding to this are terrorism potential,

00:04:35.844 --> 00:04:38.710
cyberattacks, miscalculation,
misunderstanding.

00:04:38.734 --> 00:04:42.249
The list of nuclear nightmares
tends to grow longer by the day.

00:04:42.273 --> 00:04:45.011
And there are a number
of former officials,

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:46.774
as well as experts,

00:04:46.798 --> 00:04:50.051
who worry that right now,
we're in greater danger

00:04:50.075 --> 00:04:53.304
than we were in various points
in the Cold War.

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.197
So this is scary.

00:04:56.877 --> 00:04:58.179
What can we do?

00:04:58.958 --> 00:05:00.108
Well, thankfully,

00:05:00.132 --> 00:05:01.298
["Duck and Cover"]

00:05:01.322 --> 00:05:04.695
we don't have to rely
on the advice from the 1950s.

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:05.727
(Laughter)

00:05:05.751 --> 00:05:07.736
We can take some control,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.504
and the way we do that

00:05:09.528 --> 00:05:12.759
is by starting to ask
some fundamental questions

00:05:12.783 --> 00:05:14.787
about the status quo

00:05:14.811 --> 00:05:17.535
and whether we are happy
with the way it is.

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:20.735
We need to begin asking
questions of ourselves

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:22.503
and of our elected officials,

00:05:22.527 --> 00:05:24.790
and I'd like to share
three with you today.

00:05:26.798 --> 00:05:28.996
The first one is,

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.099
"How much nuclear risk
are you willing to take or tolerate?"

00:05:34.805 --> 00:05:38.701
Right now, nuclear policy
depends on deterrence theory.

00:05:39.336 --> 00:05:41.058
Developed in the 1950s,

00:05:41.082 --> 00:05:43.750
the idea is that one
country's nuclear weapons

00:05:43.774 --> 00:05:46.761
prevents another country
from using theirs.

00:05:46.785 --> 00:05:50.511
So you nuke me, I nuke you,

00:05:50.535 --> 00:05:51.828
and we both lose.

00:05:52.794 --> 00:05:55.474
So in a way, there's a stalemate.

00:05:55.498 --> 00:05:58.028
No one uses their weapons,
and we're all safe.

00:05:59.487 --> 00:06:04.686
But this theory has real questions.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.511
There are experts
who challenge this theory

00:06:07.535 --> 00:06:10.662
and wonder: Does it really work
this way in practice?

00:06:11.516 --> 00:06:16.492
It certainly doesn't allow
for mistakes or miscalculations.

00:06:17.918 --> 00:06:19.968
Now, I don't know about you,

00:06:19.992 --> 00:06:25.110
but I feel pretty uncomfortable
gambling my future survival,

00:06:25.134 --> 00:06:28.659
yours, and our future generations',

00:06:28.683 --> 00:06:31.302
on a theory that is questionable

00:06:32.275 --> 00:06:34.706
and doesn't allow any room for a mistake.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.506
It makes me even more uncomfortable

00:06:39.386 --> 00:06:42.244
to be threatening the evaporation

00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:44.799
of millions of people
on the other side of the Earth.

00:06:46.267 --> 00:06:49.379
Surely we can do better for ourselves,

00:06:49.403 --> 00:06:52.967
drawing on our ingenuity
to solve complex problems,

00:06:52.991 --> 00:06:55.008
as we have in the past.

00:06:55.032 --> 00:06:57.705
After all, this is a man-made,

00:06:57.729 --> 00:06:58.950
human-made --

00:06:58.974 --> 00:07:01.497
I shouldn't say "man,"
because women were involved --

00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:03.157
a human-made problem.

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:07.657
We have human solutions
that should be possible.

00:07:09.238 --> 00:07:13.038
So, next question: "Who do you think
should make nuclear decisions?"

00:07:14.221 --> 00:07:18.834
Right now, in this democracy,
in the United States,

00:07:18.858 --> 00:07:20.635
one person

00:07:21.588 --> 00:07:25.040
gets to decide whether or not
to launch a nuclear strike.

00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:28.596
They don't have to consult anybody.

00:07:30.108 --> 00:07:31.984
So that's the president.

00:07:32.742 --> 00:07:35.639
He or she can decide --

00:07:35.663 --> 00:07:37.798
within a very limited amount of time,

00:07:37.822 --> 00:07:41.155
under great pressure, potentially,
depending on the scenario,

00:07:42.204 --> 00:07:45.649
maybe based on a miscalculation
or a misunderstanding --

00:07:46.197 --> 00:07:49.046
they can decide the fate
of millions of lives:

00:07:49.805 --> 00:07:52.475
yours, mine, our community's.

00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:58.303
And they can do this
and launch a nuclear strike,

00:07:58.327 --> 00:08:02.908
potentially setting in motion
the annihilation of the human race.

00:08:05.566 --> 00:08:06.716
Wow.

00:08:08.392 --> 00:08:11.494
This doesn't have to be
our reality, though, and in fact,

00:08:11.518 --> 00:08:14.838
in a number of other countries
that have nuclear weapons, it's not,

00:08:14.862 --> 00:08:17.582
including countries
that are not democracies.

00:08:19.595 --> 00:08:21.841
We created this system. We can change it.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.546
And there's actually a movement
underway to do so.

00:08:25.991 --> 00:08:28.810
So this leads me to my third question:

00:08:28.834 --> 00:08:32.602
"What do your elected officials
know about nuclear weapons,

00:08:32.626 --> 00:08:36.119
and what types of decisions
are they likely to take on your behalf?"

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:40.606
Well, Congress has
a very important role to play

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:44.900
in oversight of and interrogating
US nuclear weapons policy.

00:08:45.397 --> 00:08:47.993
They can decide what to fund,
what not to fund,

00:08:48.017 --> 00:08:49.388
and they represent you.

00:08:50.515 --> 00:08:53.524
Now unfortunately,
since the end of the Cold War,

00:08:53.548 --> 00:08:57.037
we've seen a real decline
in the level of understanding,

00:08:57.061 --> 00:08:59.687
on Capitol Hill, about these issues.

00:08:59.711 --> 00:09:03.759
While we are starting to see
some terrific new champions emerge,

00:09:03.783 --> 00:09:06.632
the reality is that the general
lack of awareness

00:09:06.656 --> 00:09:08.228
is highly concerning,

00:09:08.252 --> 00:09:12.124
given that these people need to make
critically important decisions.

00:09:14.076 --> 00:09:15.227
To make matters worse,

00:09:15.251 --> 00:09:18.979
the political partisanship
that currently grips Washington

00:09:19.003 --> 00:09:20.591
also affects this issue.

00:09:21.814 --> 00:09:23.577
This wasn't always the case, though.

00:09:23.601 --> 00:09:26.846
At the end of the Cold War,
members from both sides of the aisle

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.997
had a really good understanding about
the nuclear challenges we were facing

00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:34.053
and worked together
on cooperative programs.

00:09:34.847 --> 00:09:37.982
They recognized
that nuclear risk reduction

00:09:38.006 --> 00:09:42.196
was far too important to allow it
to succumb to political partisanship.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.548
They created programs

00:09:44.572 --> 00:09:47.895
such as the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative
Threat Reduction Program,

00:09:47.919 --> 00:09:50.438
which sought to lock down and eliminate

00:09:50.462 --> 00:09:53.445
vulnerable nuclear material
in the former Soviet Union.

00:09:54.828 --> 00:09:58.788
So we need to return to this era
of bipartisanship,

00:09:58.812 --> 00:10:01.462
mutual problem-solving

00:10:01.486 --> 00:10:05.407
that's based on understanding
and awareness about the challenges we face

00:10:05.431 --> 00:10:07.399
and the real nuclear dangers.

00:10:08.273 --> 00:10:10.103
And that's where you come in.

00:10:10.469 --> 00:10:12.311
Public pressure is important.

00:10:13.018 --> 00:10:16.270
Leaders need a constituent base to act.

00:10:16.294 --> 00:10:18.724
So create that constituent base,

00:10:18.748 --> 00:10:21.713
by asking them some simple questions.

00:10:22.325 --> 00:10:25.831
Ask them, "What do you know
about nuclear weapons?"

00:10:25.855 --> 00:10:28.498
"Do you have a nuclear expert
on your staff?

00:10:28.522 --> 00:10:31.759
Or, if not, do you know
somebody you could refer to

00:10:31.783 --> 00:10:33.989
if you need to make
an important decision?"

00:10:34.713 --> 00:10:36.972
Start to find out what they believe

00:10:36.996 --> 00:10:39.798
and whether it aligns
with your own views and values.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:44.637
Ask them, "How would you choose
to spend US national treasure?

00:10:46.266 --> 00:10:48.369
On a new nuclear arms race

00:10:48.393 --> 00:10:50.601
or another national security priority,

00:10:50.625 --> 00:10:54.008
such as cybersecurity or climate change?"

00:10:54.032 --> 00:10:57.959
Ask them, "Are you willing
to put aside partisanship

00:10:57.983 --> 00:11:02.904
to address this existential threat
that affects my survival

00:11:02.928 --> 00:11:04.643
and your constituents' survival?"

00:11:06.305 --> 00:11:10.940
Now, people will tell you nuclear policy
is far too difficult to understand

00:11:10.964 --> 00:11:14.844
and complexed and nuanced
for the general public to understand,

00:11:14.868 --> 00:11:16.463
let alone debate.

00:11:16.487 --> 00:11:19.083
After all, this is "national security."

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.391
There needs to be secrets.

00:11:22.677 --> 00:11:24.581
Don't let that put you off.

00:11:24.605 --> 00:11:26.416
We debate all sorts of issues

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.701
that are critically important
to our lives --

00:11:28.725 --> 00:11:31.113
why should nuclear weapons
be any different?

00:11:31.137 --> 00:11:34.153
We debate health care,
education, the environment.

00:11:34.177 --> 00:11:37.195
Surely congressional oversight,

00:11:37.605 --> 00:11:41.615
civic participation that are
such hallmarks of US democracy,

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:43.590
surely they apply here.

00:11:44.573 --> 00:11:48.922
After all, these are cases of life
and death that we're talking about.

00:11:50.021 --> 00:11:52.295
And we won't all agree,

00:11:52.319 --> 00:11:55.993
but whether or not you believe
nuclear weapons keep us safe

00:11:56.017 --> 00:11:59.207
or that nuclear weapons are a liability,

00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:04.715
I urge you to put aside
partisan, ideological issues

00:12:04.739 --> 00:12:06.695
and listen to each other.

00:12:08.254 --> 00:12:12.643
So I'll tell you now what I didn't have
the guts to tell my friends at the time.

00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:15.737
No, you're not safe --

00:12:16.273 --> 00:12:17.988
not just because of North Korea.

00:12:18.798 --> 00:12:21.616
But there is something
you can do about it.

00:12:23.266 --> 00:12:26.743
Demand that your elected representatives

00:12:26.767 --> 00:12:29.774
can give you answers to your questions,

00:12:29.798 --> 00:12:32.465
and answers that you can live with

00:12:32.489 --> 00:12:35.099
and that billions of others
can live with too.

00:12:36.644 --> 00:12:37.925
And if they can't,

00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:40.186
stay on them until they can.

00:12:41.284 --> 00:12:43.042
And if that doesn't work,

00:12:43.066 --> 00:12:47.609
find others, who are able
to represent your views.

00:12:48.895 --> 00:12:54.338
Because by doing so, we can begin
to change the answer to the question

00:12:54.362 --> 00:12:55.512
"Am I safe?"

00:12:57.111 --> 00:13:01.095
(Applause)
