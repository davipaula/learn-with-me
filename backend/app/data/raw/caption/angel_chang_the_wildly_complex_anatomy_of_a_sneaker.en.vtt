00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:13.253
Australians call them “runners." 
The British know them as “trainers."

00:00:13.253 --> 00:00:17.323
Americans refer to them as “tennis shoes” 
or “sneakers."

00:00:17.323 --> 00:00:20.871
Whatever you call them, 
these rubber-soled, casual shoes

00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:24.280
are worn by billions of people 
around the world.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.320
Originally invented 
in the late 19th century,

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.109
these simple canvas and rubber creations 
have changed a lot

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.270
since they first hit the pavement.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.090
Today, sneaker consumption 
is at an all-time high.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.566
No country buys more sneakers 
than the United States,

00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:44.050
where people purchase 3 pairs 
a year on average.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.139
To meet this demand, roughly 23 billion 
shoes are produced each year,

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:52.839
mostly in factories 
across China and Southeast Asia.

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.888
But making shoes has become 
more complicated, more labor-intensive,

00:00:56.888 --> 00:00:59.258
and in some ways, more dangerous,

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:02.603
for the workers involved 
and for our planet.

00:01:02.603 --> 00:01:05.433
Shoe manufacturing 
accounts for roughly one-fifth

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:08.683
of the fashion industry’s 
carbon emissions.

00:01:08.683 --> 00:01:15.682
Sneakers alone generate 313 million 
metric tons of carbon dioxide every year,

00:01:15.682 --> 00:01:20.523
which is equivalent to the annual 
emissions of 66 million cars.

00:01:20.523 --> 00:01:23.833
To better understand 
your shoe’s carbon footprint,

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:27.063
let’s dive into the anatomy of a sneaker.

00:01:27.063 --> 00:01:31.736
For starters, the heel, insole, 
midsole, and upper layer

00:01:31.736 --> 00:01:37.030
are usually made from synthetic textiles 
like polyester, nylon, latex,

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.660
and polyurethane.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.108
Mining the fossil fuels that make up these
materials emits tons of greenhouse gases.

00:01:44.108 --> 00:01:48.098
And processing those raw ingredients 
into synthetic textiles

00:01:48.098 --> 00:01:52.738
also uses a lot of energy,
further compounding that pollution.

00:01:52.738 --> 00:01:56.168
Some sneaker tops are made from 
natural sources like leather,

00:01:56.168 --> 00:01:59.473
but tanning this material 
relies on chromium;

00:01:59.473 --> 00:02:04.143
a carcinogenic chemical that can damage 
freshwater ecosystems.

00:02:04.143 --> 00:02:07.133
The outer soles of most shoes 
are made of rubber

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:10.213
that’s gone through a process 
called vulcanization.

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:14.940
This technique adds sulfur to superheated 
raw rubber to create a material

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.707
that’s both elastic and sturdy.

00:02:17.707 --> 00:02:21.630
Until recently, sneakers used 
natural rubber for this process.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.625
But today, most outer soles are made 
with a synthetic blend of natural rubber

00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:30.135
and byproducts from coal and oil.

00:02:30.135 --> 00:02:35.370
Producing these materials accounts 
for 20% of a sneaker’s carbon footprint.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.004
But more than two-thirds of the shoe’s 
carbon impact comes from the next step:

00:02:40.004 --> 00:02:41.914
manufacturing.

00:02:41.914 --> 00:02:46.090
A typical sneaker is comprised 
of 65 discrete parts,

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.269
each of which is produced 
by specialized machinery.

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.572
This means it’s cheaper for factories 
to mass-produce each piece separately

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:57.334
rather than manufacturing 
every part under one roof.

00:02:57.334 --> 00:03:00.589
But the transportation 
required to ship these pieces

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:05.262
to one assembly plant emits even more CO2.

00:03:05.262 --> 00:03:07.702
Once the components arrive 
at the assembly line,

00:03:07.702 --> 00:03:12.984
they undergo cutting, pouring, melting, 
baking, cooling, and gluing,

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:16.544
before the final products 
can be stitched together.

00:03:16.544 --> 00:03:21.022
The assembly of a typical sneaker 
requires more than 360 steps,

00:03:21.022 --> 00:03:26.537
and accounts for the remaining 20% 
of a sneaker’s environmental impact.

00:03:26.537 --> 00:03:32.518
The dispersion of factories fuels 
another problem as well: labor abuse.

00:03:32.518 --> 00:03:36.218
Most brands don’t own 
or operate their factories,

00:03:36.218 --> 00:03:38.735
so the plants they work with 
are in countries

00:03:38.735 --> 00:03:41.855
with little to no worker protection laws.

00:03:41.855 --> 00:03:45.555
As a result, many laborers 
earn below the living wage,

00:03:45.555 --> 00:03:49.945
and are exposed to harmful chemicals, 
like toxic glue fumes.

00:03:49.945 --> 00:03:51.859
When manufacturing is complete,

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.165
the shoes are packaged and transported 
to stores around the globe.

00:03:56.165 --> 00:03:59.028
For many, these shoes could last years.

00:03:59.028 --> 00:04:01.715
But for someone running 20 miles a week,

00:04:01.715 --> 00:04:06.327
a pair of running shoes will start 
wearing out after roughly 6 months.

00:04:06.327 --> 00:04:09.527
Since the shoes are made of 
so many different materials,

00:04:09.527 --> 00:04:13.979
they’re almost impossible to break down 
into recyclable components.

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:18.891
20% of these shoes are incinerated, 
while the rest are tossed into landfills

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:22.871
where they can take up to 1,000 years 
to degrade.

00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:25.942
So, how can we balance 
our love of sneakers

00:04:25.942 --> 00:04:27.979
with the need for sustainability?

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.013
First, designers should streamline 
design elements

00:04:31.013 --> 00:04:33.999
and focus on eco-friendly materials.

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:37.679
Factories need to develop energy efficient
manufacturing processes

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:40.709
that consolidate steps and sneaker parts.

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:44.229
And consumers should support 
companies using clean energy

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.992
and ethical manufacturing processes.

00:04:46.992 --> 00:04:50.472
We can also buy fewer shoes, 
wear them for longer,

00:04:50.472 --> 00:04:53.152
and donate those we no longer need.

00:04:53.152 --> 00:04:58.352
So no matter what your style, we can all 
take steps towards a sustainable future.
