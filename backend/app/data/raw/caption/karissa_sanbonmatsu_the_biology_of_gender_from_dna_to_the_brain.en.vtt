00:00:14.595 --> 00:00:18.141
So what does it mean to be a woman?

00:00:19.341 --> 00:00:21.821
We all have XX chromosomes, right?

00:00:22.496 --> 00:00:24.016
Actually, that's not true.

00:00:25.016 --> 00:00:26.752
Some women are mosaics.

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:32.176
They have a mix of chromosome types
with X, with XY or with XXX.

00:00:33.056 --> 00:00:35.472
If it's not just
about our chromosomes,

00:00:35.496 --> 00:00:37.736
then what is being a woman about?

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:40.032
Being feminine?

00:00:40.056 --> 00:00:41.512
Getting married?

00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:42.736
Having kids?

00:00:43.553 --> 00:00:47.231
You don't have to look far
to find fantastic exceptions

00:00:47.256 --> 00:00:48.872
to these rules,

00:00:48.896 --> 00:00:52.536
but we all share something
that makes us women.

00:00:53.536 --> 00:00:56.336
Maybe that something is in our brains.

00:00:57.376 --> 00:01:00.472
You might have heard theories
from last century

00:01:00.496 --> 00:01:03.352
about how men are better
at math than women

00:01:03.376 --> 00:01:04.936
because they have bigger brains.

00:01:05.656 --> 00:01:07.912
These theories have been debunked.

00:01:07.937 --> 00:01:10.831
The average man has a brain
about three times smaller

00:01:10.856 --> 00:01:12.632
than the average elephant,

00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:13.912
but that doesn't mean

00:01:13.936 --> 00:01:16.672
the average man is three times
dumber than an elephant ...

00:01:16.696 --> 00:01:17.912
or does it?

00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:20.472
(Laughter)

00:01:20.496 --> 00:01:25.672
There's a new wave
of female neuroscientists

00:01:25.696 --> 00:01:29.672
that are finding important differences
between female and male brains

00:01:29.696 --> 00:01:31.432
in neuron connectivity,

00:01:31.456 --> 00:01:34.216
in brain structure, in brain activity.

00:01:34.936 --> 00:01:38.752
They're finding that the brain
is like a patchwork mosaic --

00:01:38.776 --> 00:01:40.072
a mixture.

00:01:40.096 --> 00:01:43.736
Women have mostly female patches
and a few male patches.

00:01:44.776 --> 00:01:48.256
With all this new data,
what does it mean to be a woman?

00:01:49.296 --> 00:01:52.856
This is something that I've been
thinking about almost my entire life.

00:01:53.896 --> 00:01:57.752
When people learn that I'm a woman
who happens to be transgender,

00:01:57.776 --> 00:01:59.272
they always ask,

00:01:59.296 --> 00:02:00.896
"How do you know you're a woman?"

00:02:02.056 --> 00:02:07.472
As a scientist, I'm searching
for a biological basis of gender.

00:02:07.496 --> 00:02:10.776
I want to understand what makes me me.

00:02:12.656 --> 00:02:15.632
New discoveries
at the front edge of science

00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:19.912
are shedding light
on the biomarkers that define gender.

00:02:19.936 --> 00:02:26.072
My colleagues and I in genetics,
neuroscience, physiology and psychology,

00:02:26.096 --> 00:02:29.152
we're trying to figure out
exactly how gender works.

00:02:29.176 --> 00:02:33.032
These vastly different fields
share a common connection --

00:02:33.056 --> 00:02:34.416
epigenetics.

00:02:35.576 --> 00:02:41.672
In epigenetics,
we're studying how DNA activity

00:02:41.696 --> 00:02:44.672
can actually radically
and permanently change,

00:02:44.696 --> 00:02:47.176
even though the sequence stays the same.

00:02:48.216 --> 00:02:53.703
DNA is the long, string-like molecule
that winds up inside our cells.

00:02:53.728 --> 00:02:54.764
There's so much DNA

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:57.679
that it actually gets tangled
into these knot-like things --

00:02:57.704 --> 00:02:59.024
we'll just call them knots.

00:03:00.201 --> 00:03:05.241
So external factors change
how those DNA knots are formed.

00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:08.397
You can think of it like this:

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:14.029
inside our cells, there's different
contraptions building things,

00:03:14.077 --> 00:03:15.773
connecting circuits,

00:03:15.797 --> 00:03:18.557
doing all the things they need
to make life happen.

00:03:19.797 --> 00:03:24.317
Here's one that's sort of reading
the DNA and making RNA.

00:03:25.477 --> 00:03:29.093
And then this one is carrying
a huge sac of neurotransmitters

00:03:29.117 --> 00:03:30.933
from one end of the brain cell

00:03:30.957 --> 00:03:32.333
to the other.

00:03:32.357 --> 00:03:34.613
Don't they get hazard pay
for this kind of work?

00:03:34.637 --> 00:03:35.837
(Laughter)

00:03:36.757 --> 00:03:38.893
This one is an entire molecular factory --

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:40.693
some say it's the secret to life.

00:03:40.717 --> 00:03:42.093
It's call the ribosome.

00:03:42.117 --> 00:03:44.557
I've been studying this since 2001.

00:03:46.237 --> 00:03:49.453
One of the stunning
things about our cells

00:03:49.477 --> 00:03:53.733
is that the components inside them
are actually biodegradable.

00:03:53.757 --> 00:03:55.013
They dissolve,

00:03:55.037 --> 00:03:57.373
and then they're rebuilt each day,

00:03:57.397 --> 00:03:59.933
kind of like a traveling carnival

00:03:59.957 --> 00:04:03.677
where the rides are taken down
and then rebuilt every single day.

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:08.213
A big difference between our cells
and the traveling carnival

00:04:08.237 --> 00:04:10.412
is that in the carnival,

00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:14.237
there are skilled craftsmen
that rebuild the rides each day.

00:04:15.197 --> 00:04:17.813
In our cells, there are
no such skilled craftsmen,

00:04:17.837 --> 00:04:19.373
only dumb builder machines

00:04:19.397 --> 00:04:21.693
that build whatever's
written in the plans,

00:04:21.717 --> 00:04:23.317
no matter what those plans say.

00:04:24.437 --> 00:04:27.253
Those plans are the DNA.

00:04:27.277 --> 00:04:30.837
The instructions for every
nook and cranny inside our cells.

00:04:32.197 --> 00:04:35.053
If everything in, say,
our brain cells

00:04:35.077 --> 00:04:37.173
dissolves almost every day,

00:04:37.197 --> 00:04:40.037
then how can the brain remember
anything past one day?

00:04:40.917 --> 00:04:42.893
That's where DNA comes in.

00:04:42.917 --> 00:04:46.173
DNA is one of the those things
that does not dissolve.

00:04:46.197 --> 00:04:48.893
But for DNA to remember
that something happened,

00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:50.517
it has to change somehow.

00:04:51.477 --> 00:04:53.573
We know the change
can't be in the sequence;

00:04:53.597 --> 00:04:55.693
if it changed sequence all the time,

00:04:55.717 --> 00:05:00.613
then we might be growing like, a new ear
or a new eyeball every single day.

00:05:00.637 --> 00:05:01.653
(Laughter)

00:05:01.677 --> 00:05:03.653
So, instead it changes shape,

00:05:03.677 --> 00:05:05.653
and that's where those DNA knots come in.

00:05:05.677 --> 00:05:07.637
You can think of them like DNA memory.

00:05:09.317 --> 00:05:11.613
When something big
in our life happens,

00:05:11.637 --> 00:05:14.133
like a traumatic childhood event,

00:05:14.157 --> 00:05:16.037
stress hormones flood our brain.

00:05:16.877 --> 00:05:19.773
The stress hormones
don't affect the sequence of DNA,

00:05:19.797 --> 00:05:21.933
but they do change the shape.

00:05:21.957 --> 00:05:24.293
They affect that part of DNA

00:05:24.317 --> 00:05:28.077
with the instructions for molecular
machines that reduce stress.

00:05:28.797 --> 00:05:31.173
That piece of DNA
gets wound up into a knot,

00:05:31.197 --> 00:05:35.133
and now the dumb builder machines
can't read the plans they need

00:05:35.157 --> 00:05:37.237
to build the machines that reduce stress.

00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:41.013
That's a mouthful, but it's
what's happening on the microscale.

00:05:41.037 --> 00:05:44.453
On the macroscale, you practically lose
the ability to deal with stress,

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:46.013
and that's bad.

00:05:46.037 --> 00:05:49.237
And that's how DNA can remember
what happens in the past.

00:05:51.357 --> 00:05:53.933
This is what I think
was happening to me

00:05:53.957 --> 00:05:56.037
when I first started my gender transition.

00:05:57.277 --> 00:05:59.493
I knew I was a woman on the inside,

00:05:59.517 --> 00:06:02.493
and I wore women's clothes on the outside,

00:06:02.517 --> 00:06:05.437
but everyone saw me as a man in a dress.

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:12.133
I felt like no matter
how many things I try,

00:06:12.157 --> 00:06:14.773
no one would ever
really see me as a woman.

00:06:14.797 --> 00:06:17.853
In science, your credibility
is everything,

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:21.117
and people were
snickering in the hallways,

00:06:21.997 --> 00:06:23.453
giving me stares,

00:06:23.477 --> 00:06:25.293
looks of disgust --

00:06:25.317 --> 00:06:26.957
afraid to be near me.

00:06:28.197 --> 00:06:31.133
I remember my first big talk
after transition.

00:06:31.157 --> 00:06:32.373
It was in Italy.

00:06:32.397 --> 00:06:34.813
I'd given prestigious talks before,

00:06:34.837 --> 00:06:37.653
but this one, I was terrified.

00:06:37.677 --> 00:06:39.453
I looked out into the audience,

00:06:39.477 --> 00:06:42.333
and the whispers started --

00:06:42.357 --> 00:06:43.733
the stares,

00:06:43.757 --> 00:06:45.677
the smirks, the chuckles.

00:06:46.677 --> 00:06:52.037
To this day, I still have social anxiety
around my experience eight years ago.

00:06:53.917 --> 00:06:55.117
I lost hope.

00:06:56.877 --> 00:06:59.773
Don't worry,
I've had therapy so I'm OK --

00:06:59.797 --> 00:07:01.013
I'm OK now.

00:07:01.037 --> 00:07:02.853
(Laughter)

00:07:02.877 --> 00:07:04.693
(Cheers)

00:07:04.717 --> 00:07:08.853
(Applause)

00:07:08.877 --> 00:07:10.773
But I felt enough is enough:

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:12.413
I'm a scientist,

00:07:12.437 --> 00:07:14.293
I have a doctorate in astrophysics,

00:07:14.317 --> 00:07:16.013
I've published in the top journals,

00:07:16.037 --> 00:07:18.693
in wave-particle interactions,
space physics,

00:07:18.717 --> 00:07:20.813
nucleic acid biochemistry.

00:07:20.837 --> 00:07:23.933
I've actually been trained
to get to the bottom of things, so --

00:07:23.957 --> 00:07:25.053
(Laughter)

00:07:25.077 --> 00:07:26.333
I went online --

00:07:26.357 --> 00:07:30.677
(Applause)

00:07:31.437 --> 00:07:35.253
So I went online, and I found
fascinating research papers.

00:07:35.277 --> 00:07:38.573
I learned that these DNA knot things
are not always bad.

00:07:38.597 --> 00:07:40.933
Actually, the knotting and unknotting --

00:07:40.957 --> 00:07:43.293
it's like a complicated computer language.

00:07:43.317 --> 00:07:46.277
It programs our bodies
with exquisite precision.

00:07:47.477 --> 00:07:49.333
So when we get pregnant,

00:07:49.357 --> 00:07:52.437
our fertilized eggs grow
into newborn babies.

00:07:53.317 --> 00:07:57.373
This process requires
thousands of DNA decisions to happen.

00:07:57.397 --> 00:08:00.133
Should an embryo cell become a blood cell?

00:08:00.157 --> 00:08:02.037
A heart cell? A brain cell?

00:08:02.877 --> 00:08:06.093
And the decisions happen
at different times during pregnancy.

00:08:06.117 --> 00:08:09.293
Some in the first trimester,
some in the second trimester

00:08:09.317 --> 00:08:10.877
and some in the third trimester.

00:08:14.277 --> 00:08:17.333
To truly understand
DNA decision-making,

00:08:17.357 --> 00:08:21.117
we need to see the process
of knot formation in atomic detail.

00:08:21.877 --> 00:08:24.597
Even the most powerful
microscopes can't see this.

00:08:26.196 --> 00:08:28.917
What if we tried
to simulate these on a computer?

00:08:29.716 --> 00:08:33.196
For that we'd need
a million computers to do that.

00:08:34.037 --> 00:08:37.293
That's exactly what we have
at Los Alamos Labs --

00:08:37.317 --> 00:08:40.437
a million computers
connected in a giant warehouse.

00:08:42.237 --> 00:08:46.253
So here we're showing the DNA
making up an entire gene

00:08:46.277 --> 00:08:49.742
folded into very specific shapes of knots.

00:08:50.517 --> 00:08:51.853
For the first time,

00:08:51.877 --> 00:08:55.573
my team has simulated
an entire gene of DNA --

00:08:55.597 --> 00:08:58.637
the largest biomolecular simulation
performed to date.

00:09:00.477 --> 00:09:03.933
For the first time, we're beginning
to understand the unsolved problem

00:09:03.957 --> 00:09:07.277
of how hormones trigger
the formation of these knots.

00:09:09.557 --> 00:09:14.133
DNA knot formation
can be seen beautifully in calico cats.

00:09:14.157 --> 00:09:16.733
The decision between orange and black

00:09:16.757 --> 00:09:18.517
happens early on in the womb,

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.846
so that orange-and-black patchy pattern,

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.166
it's an exact readout of what happened

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:26.566
when that cat was
just a tiny little kitten embryo

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.030
inside her mom's womb.

00:09:28.795 --> 00:09:34.091
And the patchy pattern actually happens
in our brains and in cancer.

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:37.595
It's directly related to intellectual
disability and breast cancer.

00:09:39.955 --> 00:09:44.131
These DNA decisions
also happen in other parts of the body.

00:09:44.155 --> 00:09:49.171
It turns out that the precursor genitals
transform into either female or male

00:09:49.195 --> 00:09:51.115
during the first trimester of pregnancy.

00:09:51.795 --> 00:09:54.051
The precursor brains, on the other hand,

00:09:54.075 --> 00:09:57.555
transform into female or male
during the second trimester of pregnancy.

00:09:58.675 --> 00:10:00.731
So the current working model

00:10:00.755 --> 00:10:04.611
is that a unique mix in my mom's womb

00:10:04.635 --> 00:10:08.171
caused the precursor genitals
to transform one way,

00:10:08.195 --> 00:10:10.955
but the precursor brain
to transform the other way.

00:10:15.035 --> 00:10:17.011
Most of epigenetic research

00:10:17.035 --> 00:10:20.411
has really focused
on stress, anxiety, depression --

00:10:20.435 --> 00:10:21.891
kind of a downer,

00:10:21.915 --> 00:10:23.131
kind of bad things.

00:10:23.155 --> 00:10:24.171
(Laughter)

00:10:24.195 --> 00:10:25.771
But nowadays --

00:10:25.795 --> 00:10:27.011
the latest stuff --

00:10:27.035 --> 00:10:28.651
people are looking at relaxation.

00:10:28.675 --> 00:10:30.915
Can that have a positive
effect on your DNA?

00:10:32.195 --> 00:10:35.315
Right now we're missing
key data from mice models.

00:10:36.675 --> 00:10:38.091
We know that mice relax,

00:10:38.115 --> 00:10:42.091
but could they meditate
like the Dalai Lama?

00:10:42.115 --> 00:10:43.891
Achieve enlightenment?

00:10:43.915 --> 00:10:47.611
Could they move stones with their mind
like Jedi Master Yoda?

00:10:47.635 --> 00:10:51.491
(Yoda voice): Hm, a Jedi mouse
must feel the force flow, hm.

00:10:51.515 --> 00:10:53.451
(Laughter)

00:10:53.475 --> 00:10:56.555
(Applause)

00:10:57.755 --> 00:11:01.411
I wonder if the support I've had
since that talk back in Italy

00:11:01.435 --> 00:11:03.435
has tried to unwind my DNA.

00:11:04.635 --> 00:11:07.491
Having a great circle of friends,
supportive parents

00:11:07.515 --> 00:11:09.491
and being in a loving relationship

00:11:09.515 --> 00:11:12.915
has actually given me strength
and hope to help others.

00:11:13.875 --> 00:11:16.411
At work I wear a rainbow bracelet.

00:11:16.435 --> 00:11:19.795
Sometimes it raises eyebrows,
but it also raises awareness.

00:11:20.355 --> 00:11:22.651
There's so many transgender people --

00:11:22.675 --> 00:11:24.571
especially women of color --

00:11:24.595 --> 00:11:29.435
that are just one demeaning comment
away from taking their own lives.

00:11:31.195 --> 00:11:33.635
Forty percent of us attempt suicide.

00:11:35.235 --> 00:11:40.331
If you're listening and you feel
like you have no other option,

00:11:40.355 --> 00:11:42.131
try to call a friend,

00:11:42.155 --> 00:11:44.275
go online or try to get
in a support group.

00:11:45.755 --> 00:11:50.931
If you're a woman who's not transgender
but you know pain of isolation,

00:11:50.955 --> 00:11:52.571
of sexual assault --

00:11:52.595 --> 00:11:53.795
reach out.

00:11:56.795 --> 00:11:59.555
So what does it mean to be a woman?

00:12:00.715 --> 00:12:02.491
The latest research is showing

00:12:02.515 --> 00:12:06.611
that female and male brains
do develop differently in the womb,

00:12:06.635 --> 00:12:10.395
possibly giving us females
this innate sense of being a woman.

00:12:11.395 --> 00:12:12.651
On the other hand,

00:12:12.675 --> 00:12:17.075
maybe it's our shared sense
of commonality that makes us women.

00:12:18.195 --> 00:12:20.531
We come in so many different
shapes and sizes

00:12:20.555 --> 00:12:24.971
that asking what it means to be a woman
may not be the right question.

00:12:24.995 --> 00:12:28.715
It's like asking a calico cat
what it means to be a calico cat.

00:12:29.622 --> 00:12:34.451
Maybe becoming a woman
means accepting ourselves

00:12:34.475 --> 00:12:36.291
for who we really are

00:12:36.315 --> 00:12:38.875
and acknowledging the same in each other.

00:12:39.875 --> 00:12:41.611
I see you.

00:12:41.635 --> 00:12:43.755
And you've just seen me.

00:12:44.635 --> 00:12:49.875
(Applause and cheers)
