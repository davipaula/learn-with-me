00:00:00.163 --> 00:00:01.606
HR jargon makes me crazy.

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.635
We have to have all these stupid acronyms

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.624
that describe things that nobody
understands: OKRs and PIPs.

00:00:07.648 --> 00:00:09.283
I think we can run our businesses

00:00:09.307 --> 00:00:11.997
by just talking to each other
like regular human beings.

00:00:12.021 --> 00:00:13.464
We might actually get more done.

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:16.272
[The Way We Work]

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:20.375
I really always wanted to be
an HR professional,

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:23.142
I wanted to be able to speak
the language of management.

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.579
And you know what I've learned
after all this time?

00:00:25.603 --> 00:00:27.134
I don't think any of it matters.

00:00:27.158 --> 00:00:30.132
There's all kinds of things
that we call "best practices"

00:00:30.156 --> 00:00:32.054
that aren't best practices at all.

00:00:32.078 --> 00:00:34.830
How do we know it's best?
We don't measure this stuff.

00:00:34.854 --> 00:00:38.237
In fact, I've learned
that "best practices" usually means

00:00:38.261 --> 00:00:39.855
copying what everybody else does.

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.751
Our world is changing
and evolving all the time.

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:44.918
Here are some lessons to help you adapt.

00:00:44.942 --> 00:00:47.489
Lesson one: Your employees are adults.

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:49.624
You know, we've created so many layers

00:00:49.648 --> 00:00:52.442
and so many processes
and so many guidelines

00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.345
to keep those employees in place

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:58.049
that we've ended up with systems
that treat people like they're children.

00:00:58.073 --> 00:00:59.275
And they're not.

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:01.846
Fully formed adults
walk in the door every single day.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.426
They have rent payments,
they have obligations,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.799
they're members of society,

00:01:05.823 --> 00:01:07.989
they want to create
a difference in the world.

00:01:08.013 --> 00:01:09.696
So if we start with the assumption

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.068
that everybody comes to work
to do an amazing job,

00:01:12.092 --> 00:01:13.679
you'd be surprised what you get.

00:01:13.703 --> 00:01:17.151
Lesson two: The job of management
isn't to control people,

00:01:17.175 --> 00:01:18.532
it's to build great teams.

00:01:18.556 --> 00:01:22.127
When managers build great teams,
here's how you know it.

00:01:22.151 --> 00:01:23.468
They've done amazing stuff.

00:01:23.492 --> 00:01:24.965
Customers are really happy.

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:27.275
Those are the metrics that really matter.

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.886
Not the metrics of:
"Do you come to work on time?"

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.608
"Did you take your vacation?"
"Did you follow the rules?"

00:01:32.632 --> 00:01:34.044
"Did you ask for permission?"

00:01:34.068 --> 00:01:37.274
Lesson three: People want to do work
that means something.

00:01:37.298 --> 00:01:39.756
After they do it,
they should be free to move on.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.055
Careers are journeys.

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.820
Nobody's going to want to do
the same thing for 60 years.

00:01:43.844 --> 00:01:47.097
So the idea of keeping people
for the sake of keeping them

00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:48.630
really hurts both of us.

00:01:48.654 --> 00:01:53.554
Instead, what if we created companies
that were great places to be from?

00:01:53.578 --> 00:01:55.188
And everyone who leaves you

00:01:55.212 --> 00:01:58.466
becomes an ambassador
for not only your product,

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.521
but who you are and how you operate.

00:02:00.545 --> 00:02:04.354
And when you spread that kind
of excitement throughout the world,

00:02:04.378 --> 00:02:06.616
then we make all of our companies better.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.727
Lesson four: Everyone in your company
should understand the business.

00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:13.767
Now, based on the assumption
that we've got smart adults here,

00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:17.045
the most important thing we can teach them
is how our business works.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.448
When I look at companies
that are moving fast,

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:20.850
that are really innovative

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:25.306
and that are doing amazing things
with agility and speed,

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.021
it's because they're collaborative.

00:02:27.045 --> 00:02:31.627
The best thing that we can do
is constantly teach each other what we do,

00:02:31.782 --> 00:02:35.592
what matters to us, what we measure,
what goodness looks like,

00:02:35.616 --> 00:02:38.425
so that we can all drive
towards achieving the same thing.

00:02:38.894 --> 00:02:43.091
Lesson five: Everyone in your company
should be able to handle the truth.

00:02:43.115 --> 00:02:46.076
You know why people say
giving feedback is so hard?

00:02:46.412 --> 00:02:47.711
They don't practice.

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:49.862
Let's take the annual performance review.

00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:52.998
What else do you do in your whole life
that you're really good at

00:02:53.022 --> 00:02:54.719
that you only do once a year?

00:02:54.743 --> 00:02:56.243
Here's what I found:

00:02:56.267 --> 00:02:59.497
humans can hear anything if it's true.

00:02:59.521 --> 00:03:03.187
So let's rethink the word "feedback,"

00:03:03.211 --> 00:03:07.868
and think about it as telling people
the truth, the honest truth,

00:03:07.892 --> 00:03:10.727
about what they're doing right
and what they're doing wrong,

00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:12.482
in the moment when they're doing it.

00:03:12.506 --> 00:03:14.283
That good thing you just did, whoo!

00:03:14.307 --> 00:03:16.140
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

00:03:16.164 --> 00:03:17.322
Go do that again.

00:03:17.346 --> 00:03:20.154
And people will do that again,
today, three more times.

00:03:20.751 --> 00:03:24.584
Lesson six: Your company needs
to live out its values.

00:03:24.608 --> 00:03:27.894
I was talking to a company
not long ago, to the CEO.

00:03:27.918 --> 00:03:31.441
He was having trouble
because the company was rocky

00:03:31.465 --> 00:03:33.460
and things weren't getting done on time,

00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:35.332
and he felt like things were sloppy.

00:03:35.862 --> 00:03:38.179
This also was a man who, I observed,

00:03:38.203 --> 00:03:40.989
never showed up to any meeting on time.

00:03:41.013 --> 00:03:42.172
Ever.

00:03:42.196 --> 00:03:43.926
If you're part of a leadership team,

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.918
the most important thing that you can do
to "uphold your values" is to live them.

00:03:48.942 --> 00:03:51.313
People can't be what they can't see.

00:03:51.337 --> 00:03:53.877
We say, "Yes, we're here for equality,"

00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:56.427
and then we proudly pound our chest

00:03:56.451 --> 00:03:59.587
because we'd achieved 30 percent
representation of women

00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:00.974
on an executive team.

00:04:00.998 --> 00:04:03.830
Well that's not equal, that's 30 percent.

00:04:03.854 --> 00:04:06.789
Lesson seven: All start-up
ideas are stupid.

00:04:07.171 --> 00:04:09.566
I spend a lot of time with start-ups,

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.171
and I have a lot of friends that work
in larger, more established companies.

00:04:13.195 --> 00:04:16.024
They are always pooh-poohing
the companies that I work with.

00:04:16.048 --> 00:04:17.453
"That is such a stupid idea."

00:04:17.477 --> 00:04:19.775
Well, guess what:
all start-up ideas are stupid.

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.362
If they were reasonable, somebody else
would have already been doing them.

00:04:23.386 --> 00:04:26.519
Lesson eight: Every company
needs to be excited for change.

00:04:26.543 --> 00:04:29.132
Beware of the smoke of nostalgia.

00:04:29.156 --> 00:04:32.949
If you find yourself saying,
"Remember the way it used to be?"

00:04:32.973 --> 00:04:35.345
I want you to shift your thinking to say,

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:37.267
"Think about the way it's going to be."

00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:39.926
If I had a dream company,

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.982
I would walk in the door and I would say,

00:04:42.006 --> 00:04:43.926
"Everything's changed, all bets are off.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.208
We were running
as fast as we can to the right,

00:04:46.232 --> 00:04:47.796
and now we'll take a hard left."

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.297
And everybody would go "Yes!"

00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:52.655
It's a pretty exciting world out there,
and it's changing all the time.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.988
The more we embrace it
and get excited about it,

00:04:55.013 --> 00:04:56.591
the more fun we're going to have.
