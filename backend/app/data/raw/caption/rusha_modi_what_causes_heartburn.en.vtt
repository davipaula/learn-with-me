00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.410
Just between your chest and abdomen

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.340
is where you’ll find one of the most
important muscles

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.930
you probably didn't know you had:

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.860
the lower esophageal sphincter, or LES.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.210
When functioning properly,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.950
this ring of tissue plays a crucial
role in helping us eat.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.950
But when the LES malfunctions,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.150
it becomes the main player in heartburn

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.930
--a searing, sometimes sour-tasting
chest-spasm

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.950
that many people will experience
at some point in their lives.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.490
We know that humans have
been battling heartburn

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.070
for hundreds, if not thousands of years.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.650
But recently the incidence has risen,

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.480
making it a common stomach 
complaint worldwide.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.130
When the symptoms of heartburn become more
more regular and intense

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.170
—such as twice a week or more--

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.020
it’s diagnosed as Gastroesophageal
Reflux Disease, or GERD.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.970
But what causes this problem,

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.480
and how can it be stopped?

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.470
Heartburn starts in an area called

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.530
the gastroesophageal junction, 
where the LES resides.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.320
This smooth, muscular ring of the LES

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.190
is moderated by an intricate 
tree of nerve roots

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.770
that connect to the brain, 
the heart, and the lungs.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.620
After food enters the stomach
from the esophagus,

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.830
the muscle’s task is to stop it

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.030
from surging back up again.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.260
The LES contracts, squeezing 
the stomach entrance

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.830
and creating a high pressure zone

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.730
that prevents digestive acids 
from seeping out.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.860
But if the LES relaxes at the
wrong moment or gradually weakens,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.440
it becomes like a faulty, ill-fitting lid,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.570
causing the area to depressurize.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.290
That allows burning stomach acid--

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.410
and even chunks of food--to spurt into the

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.070
esophagus, sometimes going 
as far up as the mouth.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.800
The cause of all this internal drama

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.130
has long been put down to diet.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.380
Foods like caffeine and peppermint contain

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.430
ingredients that may have a
relaxing affect on the LES,

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.120
which makes it incapable of doing its job.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.970
Other acidic foods, 
like citrus and tomatoes,

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.700
can worsen irritation of the esophagus

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.650
when they leach out with stomach acid.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.780
Carbonated beverages can similarly

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.430
bubble up in the stomach,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.130
forcing open the valve.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.320
But researchers have discovered
that food isn’t the only trigger.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.160
Smoking poses a risk, because the nicotine
in cigarettes relaxes the LES.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.610
Consuming excessive amounts of alcohol

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.680
may have a similar effect.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.030
Pregnant women often experience
more heartburn

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.180
due to the pressure of a growing baby
on their stomachs.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.970
and the levels of certain hormones 
in their bodies.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.090
Obesity can cause hernias that disrupt

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.940
the anti-reflux barrier of
the gastroesophageal junction

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.530
that normally protects 
against heartburn.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.340
Numerous medications, 
including those for asthma,

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.770
high blood pressure, birth control, 
and depression

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.350
can also have unintended 
effects on the LES.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.300
An occasional bout of heartburn isn't

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.370
necessarily something to worry about.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.840
But, if heartburn starts happening regularly,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.850
it can weaken the LES muscle over time,

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.560
letting more and more acid escape.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.590
And if it goes untreated,

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.330
this can cause bigger problems.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.280
Over time, constant acid 
leakage from heartburn

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.090
may form scar tissue which narrows the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.740
esophageal tube, making it 
harder to swallow food.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.980
Ongoing reflux can also damage the cells

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.430
lining the esophagus--a rare
condition called

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.000
Barrett’s esophagus, which can elevate

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.440
the risk of esophageal cancer.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.790
Luckily, heartburn is often treatable with

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.740
a range of medicines that can help

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.680
neutralize or reduce stomach acid.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.700
In extreme cases, some people have surgery

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.660
to tighten the LES to 
minimize their distress.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.750
But we can often stop heartburn

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.520
before it reaches that point.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.810
Reducing the consumption 
of certain foods,

00:04:24.815 --> 00:04:27.755
not smoking, and maintaining 
a healthy weight

00:04:27.755 --> 00:04:31.085
can all dramatically reduce reflux.

00:04:31.085 --> 00:04:34.175
With proper care we can 
help our LES’s keep

00:04:34.175 --> 00:04:37.245
the chemical fountain of 
our stomachs in proper order

00:04:37.245 --> 00:04:39.825
and avoid having to feel the burn.
