Reviewer: Denise RQ

00:00:09.148 --> 00:00:13.528
Indeed, for 20 years, 
I worked in finance.

00:00:13.528 --> 00:00:16.303
I knew everything about finance, for sure.

00:00:16.308 --> 00:00:19.745
I knew the global economy
because it was my life.

00:00:19.745 --> 00:00:23.608
All the topics that you could bring up
about ecology, the end of the world, etc.,

00:00:23.608 --> 00:00:26.875
that I knew like the back of my hand
I didn't really believe in them.

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:29.855
In 2007, an extremely unusual event
occurred, you may remember,

00:00:29.855 --> 00:00:32.787
the subprime crisis, the collapse
of big American banks.

00:00:32.787 --> 00:00:34.660
It was an electric shock.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.101
I had a fair few stormy conversations
with my wife about the matter,

00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:40.796
about my job, on the limits of the model.

00:00:40.796 --> 00:00:45.772
Besides the crisis, I realized
that I was completely wrong,

00:00:45.772 --> 00:00:47.488
that we were heading for disaster.

00:00:47.488 --> 00:00:51.812
The whole conception I had of the world,
all the certainties that I had until then,

00:00:51.812 --> 00:00:54.694
were all fallen apart within a few months.

00:00:54.694 --> 00:00:59.765
That's why I'm here tonight, I've realized
that, finally, it wasn't all so bad,

00:00:59.765 --> 00:01:01.458
and that it was an opportunity

00:01:01.458 --> 00:01:03.745
because we have
the exceptional opportunity

00:01:03.745 --> 00:01:06.647
of living in an exceptional period
of human history:

00:01:06.647 --> 00:01:08.303
we are going to change the world.

00:01:08.303 --> 00:01:11.177
But before changing the world,
we have to do something,

00:01:11.177 --> 00:01:14.699
we have to do some grieving,
we have to turn the page -

00:01:14.699 --> 00:01:18.274
turning the page 
of the world we live in today.

00:01:18.274 --> 00:01:20.979
To do so, I need some help
from an American who goes

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.725
by the name of Jared Diamond
and who published "Collapse,"

00:01:23.725 --> 00:01:25.303
and soon you will see

00:01:25.303 --> 00:01:29.428
that the 5 factors of the collapse
of civilizations are reunited today.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.850
Jared Diamond has identified 5 factors

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.736
in which we find the collapse
of the Mayas, the Vikings,

00:01:35.736 --> 00:01:38.244
and all of the great
Mesopotamian civilizations.

00:01:38.244 --> 00:01:40.427
And every time,
those 5 factors were reunited.

00:01:40.427 --> 00:01:41.650
The bad news is

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.177
that the 5 factors are reunited only
at the beginning of the 21st century,

00:01:45.177 --> 00:01:48.028
but this time not only
a single civilization is threatened

00:01:48.028 --> 00:01:50.675
but the global village,
humanity, all of us.

00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:53.168
It's extremely important
to be aware of this.

00:01:53.168 --> 00:01:56.099
The first factor of the collapse
is the environmental factor.

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:59.811
For two centuries, especially
the last 50 years,

00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:03.386
we have done environmental damage,
sometimes irreversible.

00:02:03.386 --> 00:02:06.322
The second factor is climate change.

00:02:06.322 --> 00:02:09.453
All the great civilizations did face
those changes in climate.

00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:11.157
This weakens the ecosystems,

00:02:11.157 --> 00:02:15.302
that weakening also results in shortage
of resources, destabilization of a society

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:19.375
economical, geopolitical,
social consequences, you name it.

00:02:19.375 --> 00:02:23.832
Third factor, still reunited today,
the revival of military conflicts.

00:02:23.832 --> 00:02:25.877
These two first factors result in:

00:02:25.877 --> 00:02:29.423
when the ecosystems are destabilized
and there is a shortage of resources,

00:02:29.423 --> 00:02:32.401
we continue having conflicts, we make war.

00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:35.800
And let me remind you, at the moment
France is at war in Mali;

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.322
let's not forget that.

00:02:37.322 --> 00:02:42.333
Fourth factor, equally important
than the last one,

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:45.403
the cancellation of diplomatic
and commercial alliances.

00:02:45.403 --> 00:02:48.767
Things look bad, and the alliances
concluded yesterday are undermined.

00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:50.505
Today, we are all aware of the fact

00:02:50.505 --> 00:02:53.853
that the future of Europe is unknown,
we don't know what will come.

00:02:53.853 --> 00:02:58.063
And the fifth factor, not the least
worrisome: the blindness of our elites.

00:02:58.063 --> 00:03:01.379
In this whole collapse
of the civilization, the elites are not able

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.663
to evaluate the fall of their world.

00:03:03.663 --> 00:03:06.533
They are incapable of changing
their prism for the analysis.

00:03:06.533 --> 00:03:07.924
And the result?

00:03:07.924 --> 00:03:11.588
The result is simple: we will have
a political caste system

00:03:11.588 --> 00:03:15.064
which emphasizes, which accelerates
the collapse of a world.

00:03:15.064 --> 00:03:18.399
After everything I just told you,
you have to know

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.516
that the end of a world is not the same
as the end of the world.

00:03:21.516 --> 00:03:24.372
If I told you that we live
in an extraordinary time,

00:03:24.372 --> 00:03:26.357
extraordinary in the sense of etymology,

00:03:26.357 --> 00:03:30.026
there is no doubt, we live in
a transition period, between two worlds.

00:03:30.026 --> 00:03:33.045
In the world of today,
we are about to turn the page.

00:03:33.045 --> 00:03:35.184
And the world of tomorrow,
the world to come,

00:03:35.184 --> 00:03:37.776
the sustainable world,
about which I am talking today,

00:03:37.776 --> 00:03:41.525
starts to slighty assume its shape
but there is still nothing precise.

00:03:41.525 --> 00:03:42.890
How do we live?

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.384
We live in a historical period
inspiring enough

00:03:45.384 --> 00:03:47.170
that we have to reinvent things.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.964
The nearest time period,
in which man reinvented everything,

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:54.051
is the Renaissance.

00:03:54.051 --> 00:03:58.269
The question which comes up
in the 21st century is,

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.429
"Do we experience a new Renaissance?"

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:04.180
Let's see if the factors
of a renaissance are reunited.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.832
First factor of a renaissance is
a new understanding of the world.

00:04:07.832 --> 00:04:10.622
In the 15th century, Columbus
discovered the Americas,

00:04:10.622 --> 00:04:12.956
man discovered the immensity
of planet Earth,

00:04:12.956 --> 00:04:14.983
we discovered the immensity of the world.

00:04:14.983 --> 00:04:17.904
What happens at the moment,
for some decades, for some years?

00:04:17.904 --> 00:04:20.346
We discover the finiteness of the world.

00:04:20.346 --> 00:04:23.885
The planet is very small
in terms of resources, capacity,

00:04:23.885 --> 00:04:26.501
if we look at the current economic model.

00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:27.708
New understanding.

00:04:27.708 --> 00:04:28.943
Second factor:

00:04:28.943 --> 00:04:31.798
The Renaissance is a period
of very much creativity.

00:04:31.798 --> 00:04:35.388
We all know Leonardo da Vinci,
the Flemish painters.

00:04:35.388 --> 00:04:37.256
2012, 2013, what has happened?

00:04:37.256 --> 00:04:38.608
Very much creativity.

00:04:38.608 --> 00:04:42.023
3D printing is only one example.
There are lots of others.

00:04:42.023 --> 00:04:43.958
Third factor of the Renaissance:

00:04:43.958 --> 00:04:45.668
Contrary to common beliefs,

00:04:45.668 --> 00:04:48.422
the Renaissance was not
only a period of creativity,

00:04:48.422 --> 00:04:53.301
but also of much violence:
religious wars, civil wars,

00:04:53.301 --> 00:04:56.619
extermination of 
the Native Americans, slavery.

00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:58.931
And how is it in 2012, 2013?

00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:00.838
Violence on a daily basis,

00:05:00.838 --> 00:05:04.397
and children which get killed
in school by automatic weapons.

00:05:05.137 --> 00:05:08.054
Fourth factor of a renaissance:

00:05:08.054 --> 00:05:11.760
The whole world knows Gutenberg
the inventor of the printing press

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.247
who fundamentally changed
the distribution of knowledge in Europe,

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:17.011
and later in the rest of the world.

00:05:17.011 --> 00:05:19.578
Imagine, today, there is
a new technological tool

00:05:19.578 --> 00:05:22.455
which allows us to distribute
knowledge in a whole new way.

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:26.132
This tool, which we have in our hands,
provides instantaneous information.

00:05:26.132 --> 00:05:28.607
We hold the knowledge
of the world in our hands.

00:05:28.607 --> 00:05:30.948
Soon, we will see
how this is going to change.

00:05:30.948 --> 00:05:34.785
And finally, a renaissance 
- that brings me to the subject of today -

00:05:34.785 --> 00:05:38.522
it's the fact that all the certainties
of humanity have fallen apart.

00:05:38.522 --> 00:05:39.984
Let me remind you,

00:05:39.984 --> 00:05:45.340
from Aristoteles through Ptolemy
in the 2nd century to the Renaissance,

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.301
the Earth was flat,
man was the center of the world,

00:05:48.301 --> 00:05:50.573
and the stars turned around us.

00:05:50.573 --> 00:05:54.266
And those who dared
to question this unique thought,

00:05:54.266 --> 00:05:57.886
those who dared to dispute
this received, non-negotiable truth,

00:05:57.886 --> 00:06:00.943
- you know what came next -
had to deal with the Inquisition.

00:06:00.943 --> 00:06:03.363
At the stake, they had
to answer the question.

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:07.416
Copernicus and Galilee had nearly paid
with their lives because they dared to say

00:06:07.416 --> 00:06:11.359
that the Earth was not flat
and it was not the center of the universe.

00:06:11.359 --> 00:06:16.038
So today, the question presenting itself
to us in the 21st century is:

00:06:16.038 --> 00:06:18.914
"Are we committing 
the same mistake as our ancestors?

00:06:18.914 --> 00:06:22.286
Are we, also in making the mistake,
or in our certainties,

00:06:22.286 --> 00:06:25.210
the ones who will fall apart
over the next few years?"

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:29.264
The next question which follows is:

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:33.268
"What are those certainties which are
of received and non-negotiable value,

00:06:33.273 --> 00:06:37.303
which could fall apart
in 10, 15, 20, or 50 years?"

00:06:37.303 --> 00:06:38.604
There are a lot of them.

00:06:38.604 --> 00:06:40.200
As a former economist,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.551
there are at least
three certainties in economy.

00:06:42.551 --> 00:06:48.526
At first, there is the truth that growth
is the only motor of the economy.

00:06:48.526 --> 00:06:51.445
Let me remind you what
the word 'economy' means in Greek.

00:06:51.445 --> 00:06:55.240
Economy means resource management,
domain and household management.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.745
So it doesn't necessarily 
mean growth. It's not a synonym.

00:06:58.745 --> 00:07:03.592
Second truth which could fall apart
is that growth is infinite.

00:07:03.592 --> 00:07:07.202
That's our consumption model in
a finite and increasingly shrinking world

00:07:07.202 --> 00:07:10.271
as the population grows more
and more but with less resources.

00:07:10.271 --> 00:07:12.201
And we don't question this dogma.

00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:14.297
Third dogma, third received truth

00:07:14.297 --> 00:07:18.719
is the necessary sacrifice 
of the living in favor of this growth.

00:07:19.965 --> 00:07:24.206
But still, we have authorized the right
to pollute, to right to poison,

00:07:24.206 --> 00:07:26.001
the right to intoxicate.

00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:27.078
Why?

00:07:27.078 --> 00:07:28.729
Because growth demands it.

00:07:29.859 --> 00:07:32.810
The question that we are
confronted with today is:

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:38.513
If we continue like this, 
if we continue to sacrify the living,

00:07:38.514 --> 00:07:42.949
do we challenge this, 
will we authorize this dialogue?

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:47.250
The answer is also not that evident 
because we can ask ourselves

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.449
if the people who question these dogmas
of growth as motor of the economy,

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:53.130
and of the myth of infinite growth

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:57.531
are today maybe still seen
like yesterday's heretics.

00:07:57.542 --> 00:08:01.262
I must say that I am not sure,
that at this time, in the 21st century,

00:08:01.262 --> 00:08:04.708
we show a great wisdom to those who dare

00:08:04.708 --> 00:08:07.551
to question a system
which we all benefit from.

00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:10.670
It should be extremely important
for us to keep an open mind.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.586
And yet, we become more and more people.

00:08:13.586 --> 00:08:15.757
All here, I think, 
are convinced of the fact

00:08:15.757 --> 00:08:18.563
that we know that the road
we have taken for two centuries

00:08:18.563 --> 00:08:21.969
leads us directly to - how did
the philosopher Jonas say?

00:08:21.969 --> 00:08:23.214
To a tragic impasse.

00:08:23.214 --> 00:08:27.937
The economic development on which we base
our model leads us to a tragic impasse.

00:08:27.937 --> 00:08:30.320
Hans Jonas adds
a very beautiful expression:

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.543
"Nature will eventually make its ultimate
veto, anyway, and it will be over."

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:43.032
After what I just said, another question
arises I am concerned with personally:

00:08:43.032 --> 00:08:46.895
"What will our children and descendants
think of our behavior,

00:08:46.895 --> 00:08:50.743
our stubbornness of our obsession
of a destructive economic model?"

00:08:50.743 --> 00:08:55.887
It is very likely that they will call us
perhaps barbarians of the living world,

00:08:55.887 --> 00:08:58.725
and maybe they will feel
the same contempt,

00:08:58.725 --> 00:09:01.489
the same indignation
which we can feel today

00:09:01.489 --> 00:09:05.374
about those who developed slavery
two or three centuries ago.

00:09:05.374 --> 00:09:11.151
Our behavior today is not any better
than that of those we despise today.

00:09:11.151 --> 00:09:14.822
Why? Because three centuries ago,
slavery was non-negotiable.

00:09:14.822 --> 00:09:18.618
The European and American
economic model was based on slavery.

00:09:18.618 --> 00:09:21.248
And today, in 2013, what happens?

00:09:21.248 --> 00:09:24.391
Our entire economic model,
our entire society is based on what?

00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:27.990
On exploitation,
on the sacrifice of the living.

00:09:30.772 --> 00:09:34.988
The question, which, of course,
arises is, "What are we going to do?"

00:09:34.988 --> 00:09:38.931
But before we know what we will do
we have to know why we got there

00:09:38.931 --> 00:09:41.929
in order not to commit
the same mistake in tomorrow's world.

00:09:41.929 --> 00:09:43.516
And how did we get there?

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:46.061
The answer is simple
and can be said in a few words.

00:09:46.061 --> 00:09:49.509
The philosopher Descartes
already said it four centuries ago:

00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:52.158
"Man is the only master
and owner of nature."

00:09:52.158 --> 00:09:53.315
Period.

00:09:53.315 --> 00:09:57.535
We dominate nature, we shape
and form it. We do what we want.

00:09:57.535 --> 00:10:00.128
But what has happened
since this Cartesian thought?

00:10:00.128 --> 00:10:02.829
We consider nature as a bottomless pit,

00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:05.548
as a mine where we
draw from and throw things.

00:10:05.548 --> 00:10:08.295
And that's the problem.

00:10:08.295 --> 00:10:10.662
We consider this kind of nature as what?

00:10:10.662 --> 00:10:14.204
Finally, that puts man outside of nature.

00:10:14.204 --> 00:10:17.291
And this exteriority is our problem.

00:10:17.291 --> 00:10:22.454
In 1990, Michel Serres had an extremely
truthful thought, like always, he said:

00:10:22.454 --> 00:10:26.406
"But finally, the notion of nature
is a problem for us

00:10:26.406 --> 00:10:30.671
because nature assumes that man
is put into, surrounded by a living world.

00:10:30.671 --> 00:10:32.773
We are disconnected from nature.

00:10:32.773 --> 00:10:35.066
As long as we haven't solved that problem,

00:10:35.066 --> 00:10:38.957
as long as we haven't reconciled
with nature, it won't work.

00:10:38.957 --> 00:10:41.096
It's not about sacralizing nature,

00:10:41.096 --> 00:10:43.351
or putting it on an altar
like a sacred goddess,

00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:47.340
it's just about including nature
and not acting against or without it."

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.005
Well, how are we going to do that?

00:10:49.005 --> 00:10:54.239
The conclusion of my talk is 
we'll have to organize it, really simple.

00:10:54.239 --> 00:10:56.625
It's extremely simple,
we need a new controversy.

00:10:56.625 --> 00:10:59.612
What is a controversy?
It's a dispute, a global debate.

00:10:59.612 --> 00:11:03.894
What happened in Valladolid
in the 16th century, in 1550?

00:11:03.894 --> 00:11:07.245
A dispute took place in Spain

00:11:07.245 --> 00:11:10.302
as to whether Native Americans
are living beings or not.

00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:13.425
Because if we exploited
this tame workforce for free,

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.069
we would develop the New World.

00:11:15.069 --> 00:11:17.948
If they were human beings
we couldn't make them slaves.

00:11:17.948 --> 00:11:19.253
That would be intolerable.

00:11:19.253 --> 00:11:21.928
So, we discussed about
the humanity of Native Americans.

00:11:21.928 --> 00:11:25.124
In the 21st century, we need
to organize a new controversy.

00:11:25.124 --> 00:11:28.448
But this time it will be about determining

00:11:28.448 --> 00:11:31.802
where are the tolerance limits

00:11:31.802 --> 00:11:34.475
towards nature compared to human activity.

00:11:34.475 --> 00:11:38.175
What can nature bear?
What kind of economic model can it bear?

00:11:38.175 --> 00:11:39.878
Do we have the right to pollute,

00:11:39.878 --> 00:11:43.518
the right to destroy the future
of our children and their common heritage?

00:11:43.518 --> 00:11:46.050
This new controversy allows us to draft

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:50.176
the Universal Declaration 
on the Duties of Man towards Nature.

00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:52.041
Yes, I said duties. Why?

00:11:52.041 --> 00:11:55.401
The Declaration on Human Rights
has been the corner stone

00:11:55.401 --> 00:11:57.796
of the modern world, of today's world.

00:11:57.796 --> 00:12:00.342
The Universal Declaration
on the Duties of Man

00:12:00.342 --> 00:12:03.338
will be the cornerstone
of the new tomorrow.

00:12:03.338 --> 00:12:06.635
The declaration will fix
the limits of our activity.

00:12:06.635 --> 00:12:08.570
But how to launch this new controversy?

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:10.090
It needs to be organized.

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:12.955
But before organizing 
and launching it, you will tell me:

00:12:12.955 --> 00:12:16.236
"Roudaut has taken drugs. He's a utopian.
He lives in an ivory tower.

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:17.580
it's all in his fantasy."

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.322
Once more, I go back to history.

00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:22.720
Who would have thought
before Constantin and Theodosius I

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.232
that the Romans would see their empire
destroyed by a handful of people

00:12:26.232 --> 00:12:27.881
from inside called Christians?

00:12:27.881 --> 00:12:29.306
Who would have thought

00:12:29.306 --> 00:12:32.031
before the French Revolution
and the end of the monarchy

00:12:32.031 --> 00:12:35.727
that a handful of men would write
the Universal Declaration on Human Rights?

00:12:35.727 --> 00:12:38.006
Today, those who reflect
about another world,

00:12:38.006 --> 00:12:39.720
who strive for new values,

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.586
are perhaps
- perhaps you and I are -

00:12:42.586 --> 00:12:44.957
the first Christians of the Roman Empire.

00:12:44.957 --> 00:12:48.117
We may be about to change
the things from inside

00:12:48.117 --> 00:12:50.972
through the only aspiration
of our values to another world.

00:12:50.972 --> 00:12:52.922
How to organize this new controversy?

00:12:52.922 --> 00:12:55.885
That's very simple because
of an unprecedented challenge,

00:12:55.885 --> 00:12:59.068
we have a new tool in our hands,
and that's connection.

00:12:59.068 --> 00:13:02.161
We are all connected,
and that will change everything.

00:13:02.161 --> 00:13:05.638
The fact that we are connected
allows us to launch a controversy

00:13:05.638 --> 00:13:07.516
to consider the world of tomorrow.

00:13:07.516 --> 00:13:09.571
I finish my talk with this connection,

00:13:09.571 --> 00:13:14.119
as from tonight on, I suggest to launch
the first tweet about the new controversy.

00:13:14.119 --> 00:13:17.074
Here and now in Nantes, here we go, sent.

00:13:17.074 --> 00:13:20.366
I invite you to continue the debate
without me, after or with me.

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:21.429
Thank you.

00:13:21.429 --> 00:13:23.062
(Applause)
