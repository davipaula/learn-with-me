00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:16.541
Hi.

00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:18.071
I've got a question for you:

00:00:18.071 --> 00:00:21.351
how many people here
would say they can draw?

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:23.751
(Laughter)

00:00:23.751 --> 00:00:27.291
I think we've got about one or two percent
of the hands going up,

00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:28.801
and it's interesting, isn't it?

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:33.311
It's a little bit like people think
of spelling or singing.

00:00:33.311 --> 00:00:36.771
They think,"You can either
do it, or you can't."

00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:38.651
But I think you can.

00:00:38.651 --> 00:00:40.565
Because when people say they can't draw,

00:00:40.565 --> 00:00:44.285
I think it's more to do with beliefs
rather than talent and ability.

00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:48.065
So I think when you say you can't draw,
that's just an illusion,

00:00:48.065 --> 00:00:50.785
and today I'd like to prove that to you.

00:00:50.785 --> 00:00:52.295
When I say "draw",

00:00:52.295 --> 00:00:55.265
I'm not saying we're all going
to draw like Michelangelo.

00:00:55.265 --> 00:00:58.765
We are not going to be painting
the Sistine Chapel's ceiling.

00:00:58.765 --> 00:01:02.225
But would you be happy if,
by the end of this session,

00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:05.525
you could draw pictures
a little bit like this?

00:01:05.525 --> 00:01:06.955
(Audience murmuring) Oh, yes!

00:01:06.955 --> 00:01:07.855
(Laughter)

00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:11.485
Or even a little bit like this?

00:01:11.485 --> 00:01:12.465
(Laughter)

00:01:12.465 --> 00:01:16.335
Actually, there are only two things
you need to do to be able to achieve this.

00:01:16.335 --> 00:01:18.545
One is have an open mind.
Are you up for that?

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:19.475
(Audience) Yes!

00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:22.035
And two, just be prepared to have a go.

00:01:22.035 --> 00:01:24.245
So grab a pen and a piece of paper.

00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:40.811
OK, so here's how it's going to work:

00:01:41.336 --> 00:01:43.676
I’ll show you the first cartoon
we're going to do,

00:01:43.676 --> 00:01:45.496
so just watch to begin with.

00:01:45.496 --> 00:01:46.900
Here we go.

00:01:47.227 --> 00:01:48.527
Just watching.

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:56.949
That's going to be our first cartoon.

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:58.549
It's a character called Spike.

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.509
I'd like you to draw along with me.

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.929
I'll draw the first line, you draw,
and when you've done that, look up,

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.279
and I'll know you're ready
for the next line.

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:08.026
Okay, here we go.

00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:10.256
Start with the nose.

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:16.949
Now the eyes.

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:20.748
They're like 66s or speech marks.

00:02:24.233 --> 00:02:26.023
That's it.

00:02:26.461 --> 00:02:29.521
Next, the mouth. Nice, big smile.

00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:35.791
Now, over here, the ear.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.480
Next, some spiky hair.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.270
Next, put the pen to the left
to the mouth, little line like that.

00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:55.301
Pen under the ear, drop a line like that.

00:02:57.031 --> 00:03:00.411
Pen to the left of the neck,
top of the T-shirt.

00:03:01.487 --> 00:03:04.497
Line to the left, line to the right.

00:03:04.497 --> 00:03:06.677
Just hold your drawings up
and show everyone.

00:03:06.677 --> 00:03:07.527
(Laughter)

00:03:07.527 --> 00:03:08.757
How are we all doing?

00:03:08.757 --> 00:03:10.807
(Laughter)

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:14.488
OK.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.760
OK, fantastic.

00:03:22.122 --> 00:03:26.542
So, it looks like you've just learned
to draw one cartoon,

00:03:26.542 --> 00:03:28.722
but you've actually learned
more than that;

00:03:28.722 --> 00:03:30.922
you've learned a sequence
that would enable you

00:03:30.922 --> 00:03:33.742
to draw hundreds and thousands
of different cartoons,

00:03:33.742 --> 00:03:37.542
because we're just going to do
little variations on that sequence.

00:03:37.542 --> 00:03:38.542
Have a go at this.

00:03:38.542 --> 00:03:40.272
Draw along with me.

00:03:40.272 --> 00:03:41.942
Nose.

00:03:45.944 --> 00:03:48.024
Eyes.

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:56.323
Smile.

00:03:57.527 --> 00:03:58.787
That's it.

00:03:58.787 --> 00:04:00.802
Now some hair.

00:04:05.724 --> 00:04:08.024
Pen to the left of the mouth,

00:04:10.671 --> 00:04:12.841
under the hair,

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.599
little V-shape for the top,

00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:19.508
line to the left, line to the right.

00:04:19.508 --> 00:04:22.208
So we've got another character.
Let's call her Thelma.

00:04:22.208 --> 00:04:23.258
(Laughter)

00:04:23.258 --> 00:04:24.818
So, we've got Spike and Thelma.

00:04:24.818 --> 00:04:27.248
Let's try another one. Here we go.

00:04:27.248 --> 00:04:29.818
Another little variation.
You're getting the idea.

00:04:29.818 --> 00:04:32.048
Starting with the nose.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.980
But this time we'll change
the eyes slightly.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.490
Look, two circles together like that.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.280
That's it.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.490
Then, two little dots in for the eyes.

00:04:46.524 --> 00:04:49.684
And this time we'll change
the mouth slightly. Watch.

00:04:49.692 --> 00:04:51.522
Little circle colored in there.

00:04:52.197 --> 00:04:54.177
Have a go at that.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.860
Next, the ear.

00:05:00.271 --> 00:05:03.231
Now, we'll have some fun
with the hair, watch.

00:05:03.441 --> 00:05:05.201
Nice curly hair.

00:05:09.201 --> 00:05:13.521
Then same thing: pen to the left
to the mouth, little line like that.

00:05:14.251 --> 00:05:16.721
Under the ear, drop a line.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.160
Top of the T-shirt.

00:05:19.893 --> 00:05:22.543
Line to the left, line to the right.

00:05:22.543 --> 00:05:24.223
I think we'll call him Jeff.

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:25.790
(Laughter)

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.570
We'll do one more.

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:30.481
One more go. Here we go.

00:05:30.481 --> 00:05:31.751
You're getting the idea.

00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:32.531
(Laughter)

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:35.241
So we'll start with a nose again.

00:05:36.952 --> 00:05:38.722
Notice we're doing little variations.

00:05:38.722 --> 00:05:41.152
Now we'll change the eyes,
so we've got them apart.

00:05:41.152 --> 00:05:43.642
We'll put some little dots in like that.

00:05:47.463 --> 00:05:49.193
Next, the mouth slightly different.

00:05:49.193 --> 00:05:52.303
Let's put a little V-shape like that.

00:05:53.071 --> 00:05:54.531
Triangle.

00:05:54.531 --> 00:05:57.860
And a little line across,
and we'll just color this a little bit in.

00:06:01.996 --> 00:06:04.236
Now, watch this bit carefully;
some hair, watch.

00:06:04.236 --> 00:06:06.376
Here we go, little line like that.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.770
Next, a bit more there.

00:06:15.211 --> 00:06:18.951
And watch, a couple of triangles
to make a little bow.

00:06:23.018 --> 00:06:26.058
Triangle at the bottom, rest of the hair.

00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:32.501
Pen to the left of the mouth again.
You get the idea.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.200
Drop a line for the neck.

00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:39.511
Now the V-shape.

00:06:41.238 --> 00:06:44.548
Line to the left, line to the right.

00:06:44.938 --> 00:06:46.138
There we go.

00:06:46.485 --> 00:06:47.945
Let's call her Pam.

00:06:47.945 --> 00:06:49.015
(Laughter)

00:06:49.015 --> 00:06:50.005
So you've done...

00:06:50.005 --> 00:06:52.045
(Laughter)

00:06:53.065 --> 00:06:56.615
So you've done four cartoons.
You can have a little rest now.

00:06:56.615 --> 00:06:57.565
(Laughter)

00:06:57.565 --> 00:06:58.735
Take a rest.

00:06:58.735 --> 00:07:01.645
You're getting the idea.
All we're doing is little variations.

00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:03.535
I'll just demonstrate a couple to you.

00:07:03.535 --> 00:07:05.285
We could go on all day, couldn't we?

00:07:05.285 --> 00:07:07.825
You could do someone
looking unhappy, a bit like that,

00:07:07.825 --> 00:07:11.525
or you could experiment with,
perhaps, someone who is…

00:07:11.525 --> 00:07:14.755
just draw a straight line,
someone looking a bit fed up.

00:07:14.755 --> 00:07:18.165
Or perhaps, you could do anything
you like, really, just try things out.

00:07:18.165 --> 00:07:21.535
Look at this. Little squiggle.
There we are.

00:07:21.535 --> 00:07:23.515
So, all sorts of things we could do.

00:07:23.515 --> 00:07:25.985
Actually, one more I'll let you do,
one more idea.

00:07:25.985 --> 00:07:28.845
This is a great little technique.

00:07:29.203 --> 00:07:31.513
Have a go at this: people with glasses on.

00:07:31.513 --> 00:07:34.763
Just draw a nose a bit like Spike's.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.030
Next, draw some frames,

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:42.010
so two circles like that
with a little bit in between.

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:47.496
Now, just put some dots
inside for the eyes like that.

00:07:49.068 --> 00:07:51.258
Next, the ear.

00:07:51.258 --> 00:07:56.628
So it's little bit like we did before,
but this time we'll join up the frames.

00:07:57.065 --> 00:07:58.665
That's it. Watch this bit.

00:08:01.513 --> 00:08:03.303
(Laughter)

00:08:03.718 --> 00:08:06.118
And this bit I really like. Watch.

00:08:07.024 --> 00:08:09.504
(Laughter)

00:08:09.504 --> 00:08:12.044
And then, little bit there.

00:08:13.252 --> 00:08:16.522
Pencil under the mustache, line down,

00:08:18.497 --> 00:08:20.537
top of the shirt, left and right.

00:08:20.922 --> 00:08:23.752
So there we have it.
We could carry on, couldn't we?

00:08:23.752 --> 00:08:25.982
Hopefully, we've done enough
to convince you

00:08:25.982 --> 00:08:29.502
that in fact we can all draw.

00:08:29.502 --> 00:08:33.502
And not just people here.
I've worked with…

00:08:33.502 --> 00:08:38.522
I'm going to give you three examples
of other people who've learned to draw,

00:08:38.522 --> 00:08:40.762
and that actually surprised them, too.

00:08:40.762 --> 00:08:43.752
I'm going to save
what I think is my favorite,

00:08:43.752 --> 00:08:46.302
most surprising example until last.

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:48.782
The first example is:

00:08:48.782 --> 00:08:51.752
I've worked a lot with children
and students in schools.

00:08:51.752 --> 00:08:54.002
Actually the little ones,
they just draw fine,

00:08:54.002 --> 00:08:57.582
but when they get to about 15 or 16,
most of them think they can't draw.

00:08:57.582 --> 00:08:58.782
But I worked with them.

00:08:58.782 --> 00:09:00.912
I worked this week in a school

00:09:00.912 --> 00:09:04.242
where I was coaching them
on using pictures for memory.

00:09:04.242 --> 00:09:08.262
A girl was trying to remember
what red blood cells do,

00:09:08.262 --> 00:09:09.862
and she drew this little picture

00:09:09.862 --> 00:09:13.242
of a red blood cell
carrying a handbag with O2 on it

00:09:13.242 --> 00:09:17.802
to remind her that the red blood cells
carry oxygen to all parts of the body.

00:09:17.802 --> 00:09:19.252
That was a great one.

00:09:19.252 --> 00:09:22.552
The other people I worked with
are many adults in all walks of life,

00:09:22.552 --> 00:09:24.782
and particularly in business,

00:09:24.782 --> 00:09:28.232
and they often will want
to make presentations memorable.

00:09:28.232 --> 00:09:32.242
So again, a quick cartoon or sketch
could be really good for that.

00:09:32.242 --> 00:09:36.282
And again, most people think
they can't draw, but take this example.

00:09:36.282 --> 00:09:38.022
Couple of wavy lines,

00:09:41.062 --> 00:09:46.942
little boat could be a metaphor
to represent we're all in this together.

00:09:46.942 --> 00:09:49.782
So that, if that was just drawn
in the presentation,

00:09:49.782 --> 00:09:52.242
would really stay
in the memory, wouldn't it?

00:09:52.242 --> 00:09:53.082
Yeah.

00:09:53.082 --> 00:09:56.292
But the third example is -
you shouldn't have favorites, should you?

00:09:56.292 --> 00:09:58.042
This is my favorite.

00:09:58.042 --> 00:10:01.262
Have you ever been at the party
when someone asks you what you do?

00:10:01.262 --> 00:10:03.852
It gets a little bit skeptical
when people ask me that.

00:10:03.852 --> 00:10:05.772
This lady said to me, well -

00:10:05.772 --> 00:10:09.012
I said, "I do a little bit of training,
and I teach people to draw,"

00:10:09.012 --> 00:10:13.472
and she said, "Would you come along
and do some for our group?"

00:10:13.472 --> 00:10:16.542
She said, "I work with some people"
- she was a volunteer -

00:10:16.542 --> 00:10:19.292
a group of people
who have suffered strokes.

00:10:19.292 --> 00:10:22.472
So I said, "Sure, I could spare
some time for that."

00:10:22.472 --> 00:10:24.532
So I said I would,
and I booked the time in.

00:10:24.532 --> 00:10:25.682
Have you ever done that?

00:10:25.682 --> 00:10:26.882
You get near of that time

00:10:26.882 --> 00:10:29.362
and you think,
"What have I let myself in for here?"

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:30.772
"Will I be able to do it?"

00:10:30.772 --> 00:10:33.772
I thought, "What could I
do with them?" you see.

00:10:33.772 --> 00:10:37.882
"I know. I'll do my cartoon drawing.
They'll like that."

00:10:37.882 --> 00:10:40.802
But then, as I got near of the time,
I got more apprehensive,

00:10:40.802 --> 00:10:42.162
because then I was thinking,

00:10:42.162 --> 00:10:44.662
"I've worked with children,
with all sorts of adults;

00:10:44.662 --> 00:10:46.672
I've never worked with a group like this."

00:10:46.672 --> 00:10:50.512
It turns out it was all part
of a charity called TALK.

00:10:50.512 --> 00:10:55.492
This TALK charity is a wonderful charity
that helps people who've suffered strokes,

00:10:55.492 --> 00:10:59.492
but have a particular condition
known as aphasia.

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:03.062
You might have heard of aphasia,
sometimes called dysphasia.

00:11:03.062 --> 00:11:07.252
The key thing is it affects
their ability to communicate.

00:11:07.252 --> 00:11:09.512
So, for example, they might have trouble

00:11:09.512 --> 00:11:13.062
reading, writing, speaking,
or understanding.

00:11:13.062 --> 00:11:16.292
It can be quite an isolating condition;

00:11:16.292 --> 00:11:20.642
it can be very, very frustrating
and can lead to a loss of confidence.

00:11:20.642 --> 00:11:24.772
Anyway, so I prepared all this stuff,
what to do for this session

00:11:24.772 --> 00:11:27.132
- for a couple of hours,
tea break in the middle -

00:11:27.132 --> 00:11:29.962
and I got more apprehensive.

00:11:29.962 --> 00:11:31.832
But actually, I needn't have worried,

00:11:31.832 --> 00:11:34.542
because I'm going to show you now
the work that they did.

00:11:34.542 --> 00:11:37.292
It was one of the best things
I've ever done.

00:11:37.292 --> 00:11:39.754
I'm going to show you the first slide.

00:11:39.754 --> 00:11:42.644
I taught them Spike,
just like I did for you,

00:11:42.644 --> 00:11:46.204
and I want you to see the reaction
on their faces when they did this.

00:11:46.745 --> 00:11:49.505
(Audience) Oh.

00:11:49.505 --> 00:11:52.065
What you can see here
are two of the stroke recoverers

00:11:52.065 --> 00:11:53.195
on the left and right,

00:11:53.195 --> 00:11:55.505
and one of the volunteer
helpers in the center.

00:11:56.252 --> 00:12:00.602
Each stroke recoverer, there are about 36
in the room with volunteers as well,

00:12:00.602 --> 00:12:02.812
there's one-to-one helpers.

00:12:02.812 --> 00:12:05.512
You can just see the delight
on their faces, can't you?

00:12:05.512 --> 00:12:07.732
Let's look at another picture.

00:12:08.746 --> 00:12:12.056
This is a gentleman called David,
and he's holding up his picture,

00:12:12.056 --> 00:12:14.786
and you can tell it was the picture
of Spike, can't you?

00:12:14.786 --> 00:12:18.046
In fact, I think he's drawn Spike
even better there.

00:12:18.046 --> 00:12:21.536
But what I didn't realize
until even after the session

00:12:21.536 --> 00:12:24.706
was that the number of the people
in this session, including David,

00:12:24.706 --> 00:12:27.246
were drawing with their wrong hand.

00:12:27.922 --> 00:12:31.752
David's stroke meant that it affected
the right side of his body,

00:12:31.752 --> 00:12:34.542
and he drew with his left hand,
as many did.

00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:37.232
Nobody mentioned it to me,
nobody complained.

00:12:37.232 --> 00:12:39.032
They just got on with it.

00:12:39.032 --> 00:12:41.172
It was an inspirational session for me.

00:12:41.172 --> 00:12:43.232
It was quite a humbling session,

00:12:43.232 --> 00:12:45.512
one of the best things
I felt I've ever done.

00:12:45.512 --> 00:12:49.512
At the end of it, I had a lovely email
from doctor Mike Jordan,

00:12:49.512 --> 00:12:51.772
and he's the chair of the TALK group;

00:12:51.772 --> 00:12:54.822
happens to be a medical doctor,
but he's the chair of the group.

00:12:54.822 --> 00:12:56.772
He wrote to me, and I'm quoting, he said,

00:12:56.772 --> 00:13:01.012
"Our recoverers learned today
that they can draw.

00:13:01.012 --> 00:13:02.532
It's a bit more than that;

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:05.792
this sort of activity
really builds their confidence."

00:13:05.792 --> 00:13:08.542
So I was happy, he was happy,
everyone was happy,

00:13:08.542 --> 00:13:09.972
they've invited me back again,

00:13:09.972 --> 00:13:13.062
and I go in there now
about every three or four months.

00:13:13.062 --> 00:13:16.112
So it's great. I thought
that was a lovely example to share.

00:13:16.112 --> 00:13:17.382
Fancy one more drawing?

00:13:17.382 --> 00:13:18.302
(Audience) Yes.

00:13:18.302 --> 00:13:20.502
Here we go. Grab your pens.

00:13:24.121 --> 00:13:26.561
Here we go. Right.

00:13:26.561 --> 00:13:29.521
I'm going to get you to draw someone
that you would recognize.

00:13:29.521 --> 00:13:34.021
So start with a big nose,
a bit like Spike's.

00:13:35.791 --> 00:13:40.501
Next, we'll do some eyes,
and you might be thinking,

00:13:42.511 --> 00:13:44.941
"This is also a bit like Spike."

00:13:44.941 --> 00:13:46.741
Watch the next bit.

00:13:51.461 --> 00:13:53.061
You're getting warm.

00:13:56.956 --> 00:13:58.976
There you go.

00:14:00.754 --> 00:14:03.324
Little line down there.

00:14:04.986 --> 00:14:07.076
Down here.

00:14:07.076 --> 00:14:11.076
Little V-shape,
line to the left, line to the right.

00:14:11.076 --> 00:14:12.866
And you've got Albert Einstein.

00:14:12.866 --> 00:14:13.826
(Laughter)

00:14:13.826 --> 00:14:16.556
So you've got the pens with you,

00:14:16.556 --> 00:14:21.006
you've proved that you can draw.

00:14:21.006 --> 00:14:23.106
You're very welcome
to take the pens with you

00:14:23.106 --> 00:14:24.506
and have a practice at home,

00:14:24.506 --> 00:14:25.676
even show somebody else.

00:14:25.676 --> 00:14:29.676
But actually, I'd like to leave you
with a final thought.

00:14:30.155 --> 00:14:32.265
When you walked in here today,

00:14:32.265 --> 00:14:35.205
many of you didn't believe
you could draw.

00:14:35.801 --> 00:14:38.991
I've got a question for you about that.

00:14:38.991 --> 00:14:42.781
How many other beliefs
and limiting thoughts

00:14:42.781 --> 00:14:46.491
do we all carry around with us every day?

00:14:46.491 --> 00:14:50.491
Beliefs that we could perhaps
potentially challenge

00:14:50.491 --> 00:14:52.791
and think differently about.

00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:56.271
If we did challenge those beliefs
and think differently about them,

00:14:56.271 --> 00:15:00.691
apart from drawing, what else
would be possible for us all?

00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:01.971
Thank you very much.

00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:02.871
(Applause)
