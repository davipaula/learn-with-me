00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:24.784
Their fall from the tower sends 
Ethic and Hedge

00:00:24.784 --> 00:00:29.024
spinning into the rapids 
of a river of pure energy.

00:00:30.944 --> 00:00:36.881
This torrent flows from the Bradbarrier
all the way to Huxenborg.

00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:39.981
There an entire city’s worth of factories

00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:43.061
build the robots 
and house the Node of Memory,

00:00:43.061 --> 00:00:47.433
the last of the three powerful artifacts 
Ethic needs to collect.

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:49.943
After a long day and a longer night

00:00:49.943 --> 00:00:53.663
they find themselves 
in a canyon of brick and steel.

00:00:58.918 --> 00:01:01.573
Just when they’re about to reach 
the end of the line,

00:01:01.573 --> 00:01:03.323
a rope catches them.

00:01:07.023 --> 00:01:11.137
Their savior, Lemma, 
has been waiting for them.

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:15.089
When Ethic claimed the Node of Creation 
from the forest tower,

00:01:15.089 --> 00:01:18.989
radios all across the land 
came back to life.

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:23.765
Adila, the resistance leader, 
immediately started contacting her allies,

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:26.375
none more important than Lemma,

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:32.268
a brilliant scientist working from within
Huxenborg to bring down the machines.

00:01:32.268 --> 00:01:36.268
Unfortunately, the radios 
also tipped off the robots.

00:01:36.268 --> 00:01:38.528
So they’ve taken defensive measures

00:01:38.528 --> 00:01:43.356
to protect the final artifact in its home 
in the very heart of the city.

00:01:43.356 --> 00:01:48.511
There’s only one way to get there: 
the gauntlet of forking paths.

00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:54.897
It’s a deadly series of luminous conveyors
that wind underneath Huxenborg.

00:01:54.897 --> 00:01:56.717
Starting from the current position,

00:01:56.717 --> 00:02:01.112
each section runs for a distance, 
then splits in two.

00:02:01.112 --> 00:02:04.542
Every branch does the same thing, 
again and again.

00:02:04.542 --> 00:02:06.942
There are thousands of branches.

00:02:06.942 --> 00:02:12.884
Only one path leads to the artifact; 
all the others to destruction.

00:02:12.884 --> 00:02:17.503
Fortunately, the Node of Creation 
has granted Hedge a strange power:

00:02:17.503 --> 00:02:21.223
he can produce slightly smaller versions 
of himself.

00:02:21.223 --> 00:02:26.433
Each version can do only two things: 
radio information back to its parent,

00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:30.173
and produce slightly smaller 
versions of itself…

00:02:30.173 --> 00:02:33.863
which can do the same two things, 
as can their children,

00:02:33.863 --> 00:02:36.803
for as many generations as needed.

00:02:36.803 --> 00:02:41.854
A patrol is closing in on their position, 
so Ethic’s time is limited.

00:02:41.854 --> 00:02:47.057
What instructions should she give 
Hedge to find the one safe path?

00:02:47.057 --> 00:02:53.835
Pause the video to figure it out yourself.

00:02:53.835 --> 00:02:54.825
Hint in 3

00:02:54.825 --> 00:02:56.025
Hint in 2

00:02:56.025 --> 00:02:56.985
Hint in 1

00:02:57.825 --> 00:03:02.987
Programmers have an elegant tool 
in their arsenal called recursion.

00:03:02.987 --> 00:03:08.328
Recursion is when you have a set of 
instructions that refers back to itself.

00:03:08.328 --> 00:03:11.288
It’s like using a word 
in its own definition,

00:03:11.288 --> 00:03:15.848
except where that’s frowned upon,
this is incredibly effective.

00:03:15.848 --> 00:03:20.360
Recursion involves repetition, 
but in a different way than loops.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.360
Where a loop takes one action 
and repeats it again and again,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.662
recursion will start an action, 
and before it’s finished, use it again,

00:03:28.662 --> 00:03:32.662
and before that’s finished, 
use it again, and so on.

00:03:32.662 --> 00:03:36.662
It keeps doing this until 
some end state is reached.

00:03:36.662 --> 00:03:40.824
It then passes the information back up,
layer after layer,

00:03:40.824 --> 00:03:44.444
until it reaches the top 
and ends the cycle.

00:03:44.444 --> 00:03:49.106
Recursion is ideal for problems 
that involve self-similarity,

00:03:49.106 --> 00:03:51.966
where each part resembles 
the larger whole.

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:57.970
Like, for example, a deadly defense 
system designed to end any person or thing

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.860
who dares tread upon it.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.920
Pause the video to figure it out yourself.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.713
Solution in 3

00:04:02.713 --> 00:04:03.633
Solution in 2

00:04:03.633 --> 00:04:04.713
Solution in 1

00:04:04.993 --> 00:04:08.034
Ethic’s conundrum seems sprawling 
on the surface,

00:04:08.034 --> 00:04:12.400
but there’s a remarkably simple
solution to it using recursion.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.150
In order to find it, let’s first look 
at the simplest version of this puzzle:

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.420
what if the entire maze 
were just two paths?

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.038
If Hedge copies himself, the copy 
that goes the wrong way will be destroyed.

00:04:25.038 --> 00:04:27.757
So the other one, 
which will reach the artifact,

00:04:27.757 --> 00:04:32.457
can radio back the path it took,
and then no matter which way is correct,

00:04:32.457 --> 00:04:34.858
that’s the answer Hedge will receive.

00:04:34.858 --> 00:04:38.438
This is called the "base case"
of the recursion.

00:04:38.438 --> 00:04:41.778
Now, suppose the maze 
branches twice from the starting point,

00:04:41.778 --> 00:04:44.760
and at every intersection, 
Hedge’s copies—

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.620
let’s call them Twig 1 and Twig 2—

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.627
make more copies— 
let’s call them Leaves 1 through 4.

00:04:52.627 --> 00:04:55.747
Three Leaves will be destroyed.

00:04:55.747 --> 00:04:59.863
The one that reaches the artifact 
will radio back the right answer,

00:04:59.863 --> 00:05:01.843
but only to its parent.

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:05.723
So if Twig 1 or 2 is waiting 
at an intersection

00:05:05.723 --> 00:05:07.713
and hears something over the radio,

00:05:07.713 --> 00:05:11.273
that’s the right way to go 
to the artifact from where it is.

00:05:11.273 --> 00:05:14.563
To tell Hedge the right answer 
from his perspective,

00:05:14.563 --> 00:05:17.003
the Twig should say which way it went,

00:05:17.003 --> 00:05:20.603
and then the route 
it just heard over the radio.

00:05:20.603 --> 00:05:25.393
This same process will work no matter 
how many times the maze branches.

00:05:25.393 --> 00:05:28.353
Any answer a copy hears on the radio

00:05:28.353 --> 00:05:31.653
must be the way to the control room 
from its location,

00:05:31.653 --> 00:05:34.003
and if it then adds the branch it took,

00:05:34.003 --> 00:05:37.223
it can tell its parent 
how to get there as well.

00:05:37.223 --> 00:05:41.223
We can sum up the instructions 
in an action called Pathfinder

00:05:41.223 --> 00:05:44.353
that every version of Hedge will follow:

00:05:44.353 --> 00:05:46.643
1. If you’ve reached the artifact,

00:05:46.643 --> 00:05:50.737
radio to your parent whether 
you got there by going left or right.

00:05:50.737 --> 00:05:54.567
2. When you reach an intersection, 
move off the conveyor

00:05:54.567 --> 00:05:58.547
and send new copies down the left 
and right paths.

00:05:58.547 --> 00:06:00.827
Have them each run Pathfinder.

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:02.867
This is where recursion comes in,

00:06:02.867 --> 00:06:07.961
and this may happen many times before
the last instruction triggers, which is:

00:06:07.961 --> 00:06:12.948
3. If you hear anything over the radio,
you should radio to your parent

00:06:12.948 --> 00:06:16.577
whether you got to your spot 
by going left or right,

00:06:16.577 --> 00:06:19.427
then repeat everything you just heard.

00:06:19.427 --> 00:06:23.423
Pathfinder is an example 
of what programmers call functions,

00:06:23.423 --> 00:06:26.113
subroutines, or procedures.

00:06:26.113 --> 00:06:29.503
No matter the terminology, 
the idea is the same—

00:06:29.503 --> 00:06:34.297
it’s a set of instructions given a label 
so that it can be easily reused—

00:06:34.297 --> 00:06:36.607
perhaps even by itself.

00:06:36.607 --> 00:06:39.583
And in our case that’ll work perfectly—

00:06:39.583 --> 00:06:44.813
an entire network of paths mapped
using just three instructions.

00:06:46.257 --> 00:06:47.887
So here's what happens.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.537
By the time the patrol rounds the corner,
Ethic and Lemma have improvised disguises.

00:07:15.537 --> 00:07:19.657
They try to confuse the bots 
long enough to buy Hedge time.

00:07:31.473 --> 00:07:36.251
Finally, Hedge’s radio crackles to life 
with a series of directions.

00:07:36.251 --> 00:07:40.101
The three dive onto the conveyor
and flee for their lives,

00:07:40.101 --> 00:07:43.821
with a squadron of enforcer bots 
in hot pursuit.
