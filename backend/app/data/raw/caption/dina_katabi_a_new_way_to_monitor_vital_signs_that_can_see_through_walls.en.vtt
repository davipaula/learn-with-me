00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.325
When I was a kid,

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.249
I was, like many of you in this room,
very much fascinated by Star Wars,

00:00:19.273 --> 00:00:23.749
and what fascinated me the most
is this notion of the Force,

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:26.883
this energy that connects
all people and all objects

00:00:26.907 --> 00:00:30.325
and allows you to feel people
that you can't even see.

00:00:30.753 --> 00:00:33.841
And I remember many nights,
I would be sitting at home,

00:00:33.865 --> 00:00:37.835
just, like, concentrating and focusing,
trying to feel the Force,

00:00:38.624 --> 00:00:41.187
and I didn't feel anything, don't worry.

00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:43.068
(Laughter)

00:00:43.092 --> 00:00:45.942
And later in life, I became a scientist.

00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:50.679
I joined the MIT faculty
and started working on wireless signals.

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:54.327
These are things like Wi-Fi
or cellular systems,

00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:56.703
and I did a lot of work in that domain.

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.078
But then, again, this Force thing
kept nagging me,

00:01:02.102 --> 00:01:04.027
and at some point, I was just like,

00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:08.703
"Wait a minute, these wireless signals --
they are like the Force."

00:01:08.727 --> 00:01:09.921
So if you think about it,

00:01:09.945 --> 00:01:12.576
wireless signals,
they travel through space,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.080
they go through obstacles
and walls and occlusions,

00:01:16.104 --> 00:01:17.345
and some of them,

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.519
they reflect off our bodies,
because our bodies are full of water,

00:01:21.543 --> 00:01:23.749
and some of these minute reflections,

00:01:23.773 --> 00:01:25.031
they come back.

00:01:25.055 --> 00:01:32.026
And if, just if, I had a device that can
just sense these minute reflections,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.034
then I would be able to feel people
that I cannot see.

00:01:36.444 --> 00:01:40.197
So I started working with my students
on building such a device,

00:01:40.221 --> 00:01:43.531
and I want to show you
some of our early results.

00:01:44.584 --> 00:01:46.867
So here, you see my student standing,

00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:48.868
and here is our device.

00:01:48.892 --> 00:01:54.502
And we are going to put the device
in the other office, behind the wall,

00:01:54.526 --> 00:01:57.343
and we are going
to monitor him as he moves.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:01.446
This red dot is tracking him
using wireless signals.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.544
And as you can see, the red dot
is tracking his movements very accurately,

00:02:07.568 --> 00:02:12.322
purely based on how his body interacts
with the surrounding wireless signals.

00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:15.335
Pretty accurate, isn't it?

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:18.575
He has no wearables, nothing.

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.413
(Applause)

00:02:21.437 --> 00:02:23.182
Now you might be wondering,

00:02:23.206 --> 00:02:26.388
how is it possible
that we can sense people

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:30.258
and track them, without
any wearables, through walls,

00:02:30.282 --> 00:02:33.648
and the easiest analogy
to think about is radar.

00:02:33.672 --> 00:02:35.765
I'm sure many of you
have seen this picture.

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:37.947
You transmit a wireless signal to the sky,

00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:40.939
it reflects off some airplane,
comes back to you,

00:02:40.963 --> 00:02:43.304
and you start detecting these airplanes.

00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:46.272
But if it were just radar,

00:02:46.296 --> 00:02:48.549
then we would have this 50 years ago.

00:02:49.272 --> 00:02:50.978
So it's not just radar.

00:02:51.285 --> 00:02:53.475
There are two key differences.

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:55.992
So the first difference, of course --

00:02:56.016 --> 00:02:59.535
you can't, like radar, just blast
wireless power at somebody.

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:02.286
You're going to fry them
like if they were in a microwave.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.460
Don't do that.

00:03:04.595 --> 00:03:09.660
So it means that you have to be able
to deal with very weak signals,

00:03:09.684 --> 00:03:12.810
and that means that your device
has to be very sensitive.

00:03:14.144 --> 00:03:18.275
The second difference is that,
unlike the sky, where it's empty --

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.443
if you are lucky, there is one airplane
that you can catch there.

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:22.809
Like, look at the room

00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:25.721
and look how many objects
and people there are.

00:03:25.745 --> 00:03:29.682
So in indoor environments, the signal
not only reflects off the person,

00:03:29.706 --> 00:03:33.499
if reflects off the person,
off the floor, the ceiling,

00:03:33.523 --> 00:03:35.745
off other people around,

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.752
and you get very complex reflections

00:03:37.776 --> 00:03:40.507
where the same signal reflects
off me and then off you,

00:03:40.531 --> 00:03:42.769
and then off the ceiling,
then off the floor.

00:03:42.793 --> 00:03:45.962
And you have to make sense of that mess.

00:03:47.993 --> 00:03:49.842
But we were lucky.

00:03:49.866 --> 00:03:52.358
We were coming at the right time.

00:03:53.252 --> 00:03:55.124
So two things helped us.

00:03:55.148 --> 00:03:59.204
The first thing is radiotechnologies
have evolved a lot,

00:03:59.228 --> 00:04:01.003
and over the last decade,

00:04:01.027 --> 00:04:03.337
radio technology
became much more powerful,

00:04:03.361 --> 00:04:07.098
so we were able to build
very sensitive radios

00:04:07.122 --> 00:04:10.479
that can sense weak and minute RF signals.

00:04:11.725 --> 00:04:14.764
The second thing: machine learning.

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:16.788
So you keep hearing about machine learning

00:04:16.812 --> 00:04:19.773
and there was a revolution
of machine learning recently,

00:04:19.797 --> 00:04:20.948
in deep learning,

00:04:20.972 --> 00:04:24.741
and that allowed us to build
machine-learning models

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:28.312
that can understand wireless signals
and interpret them

00:04:28.336 --> 00:04:31.841
so they would know what happened
in the environment.

00:04:31.865 --> 00:04:35.675
So if you think of it,
the radio is like the ear of our device

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.278
and the machine learning
is like the brain,

00:04:38.302 --> 00:04:42.125
and together, they have
a very powerful device.

00:04:44.108 --> 00:04:49.131
So what else can we sense about people
using wireless signals?

00:04:50.458 --> 00:04:51.609
Sleep.

00:04:51.633 --> 00:04:54.062
Sleep, actually, is something
very dear to my heart,

00:04:54.086 --> 00:04:56.013
because my sleep is a disaster.

00:04:56.037 --> 00:04:57.385
(Laughter)

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:00.638
So one thing is when you start working
on some physiological signal

00:05:00.662 --> 00:05:03.321
and you discover that yours sucks.

00:05:03.908 --> 00:05:07.003
(Laughter)

00:05:07.344 --> 00:05:09.470
So you can see why we can capture sleep,

00:05:09.494 --> 00:05:12.760
because the person walks and the device
sees him as he walks to bed,

00:05:12.784 --> 00:05:15.059
when he stops tossing around in bed,

00:05:15.083 --> 00:05:16.924
when he steps out of bed,

00:05:16.948 --> 00:05:20.646
and that measure of sleep
is what people call actigraphy.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.924
It's based on motion.

00:05:23.087 --> 00:05:26.381
But it turned out
that we can actually get sleep

00:05:26.405 --> 00:05:28.792
at a much more important level.

00:05:28.816 --> 00:05:32.380
We can understand
the change in the brain waves

00:05:32.404 --> 00:05:33.952
that occur during sleep.

00:05:35.403 --> 00:05:38.356
So, many of you probably know
that as we go to sleep,

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.753
our brainwaves change
and we enter different stages:

00:05:41.777 --> 00:05:45.846
awake, light sleep, deep sleep
and REM, or rapid eye movement.

00:05:46.267 --> 00:05:50.601
These stages are of course
related to sleep disorders,

00:05:50.625 --> 00:05:53.735
but they are also related
to various diseases.

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:59.220
So for example, disturbances in REM
are associated with depression.

00:05:59.718 --> 00:06:03.646
Disturbances in deep sleep
are associated with Alzheimer's.

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:07.153
So if you want to get sleep staging,

00:06:07.177 --> 00:06:09.487
today, you will send the person
to the hospital,

00:06:09.511 --> 00:06:12.065
they put all of these
electrodes on their head,

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:13.919
and they ask them to sleep like that.

00:06:13.943 --> 00:06:16.003
(Laughter)

00:06:16.027 --> 00:06:18.962
It's not really a happy experience.

00:06:20.155 --> 00:06:23.091
So what if I tell you
that I can do the same thing

00:06:23.115 --> 00:06:26.282
but without any of these electrodes
on the person's body?

00:06:27.596 --> 00:06:29.468
So here is our device,

00:06:29.492 --> 00:06:32.254
transmitting very low power
wireless signal,

00:06:32.278 --> 00:06:34.390
analyzes the reflections using AI

00:06:34.414 --> 00:06:37.580
and spits out the sleep stages
throughout the night.

00:06:38.647 --> 00:06:42.229
So we know, for example,
when this person is dreaming.

00:06:44.333 --> 00:06:45.483
Not just that ...

00:06:46.691 --> 00:06:49.778
we can even get your breathing
while you are sitting like that,

00:06:49.802 --> 00:06:51.375
and without touching you.

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:53.001
So he is sitting and reading

00:06:53.025 --> 00:06:55.970
and this is his inhales, exhales.

00:06:55.994 --> 00:06:57.985
We asked him to hold his breath,

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:00.875
and you see the signal
staying at a steady level

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:02.050
because he exhaled.

00:07:02.074 --> 00:07:03.224
He did not inhale.

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:07.763
And I want to zoom in on the signal.

00:07:07.787 --> 00:07:09.850
And this is the same signal as before.

00:07:09.874 --> 00:07:11.555
These are the inhales,

00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:13.223
these are the exhales.

00:07:13.247 --> 00:07:15.334
And you see these blips on the signal?

00:07:15.358 --> 00:07:16.669
These are not noise.

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:18.938
They are his heartbeats.

00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:21.772
And you can see them beat by beat.

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:27.660
So I want to stop here for a moment
and show you a live demo.

00:07:27.684 --> 00:07:29.755
Zach is going to help me with the demo,

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:34.534
and we're going to use the device
to monitor Zach's breathing.

00:07:35.272 --> 00:07:39.040
So this white box
that you see here is the device,

00:07:39.064 --> 00:07:41.405
and Zach is turning it on ...

00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:46.122
and let's see whether he breathes well.

00:07:46.146 --> 00:07:50.748
So we're going to do exactly what we did
in the video with the other guy,

00:07:50.772 --> 00:07:53.463
so the wireless signal is going through,

00:07:53.487 --> 00:07:55.137
it's touching Zach's body,

00:07:55.161 --> 00:07:57.384
and it's reflecting back to the device,

00:07:57.408 --> 00:08:00.779
and we want to monitor his breathing,
his inhale-exhale motion.

00:08:00.803 --> 00:08:03.326
So we see the inhales, exhales --

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.723
so see, these ups and downs
are Zach breathing.

00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:12.342
Inhaling, exhaling.

00:08:12.366 --> 00:08:17.968
(Applause)

00:08:17.992 --> 00:08:20.144
So, he can breathe.

00:08:20.168 --> 00:08:21.589
(Laughter)

00:08:21.613 --> 00:08:23.811
Zach, can you hold your breath, please?

00:08:25.216 --> 00:08:28.279
OK, so now he's holding his breath,

00:08:28.303 --> 00:08:30.557
so you see the signal stays
at a steady level,

00:08:30.581 --> 00:08:32.207
and these are his heartbeats.

00:08:32.231 --> 00:08:35.707
Beat, beat, beat, beat, beat.

00:08:35.731 --> 00:08:36.732
(Applause)

00:08:36.756 --> 00:08:38.923
OK, Zach, you can breathe again.

00:08:38.947 --> 00:08:40.836
(Laughter)

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.280
We don't want accidents here.

00:08:42.304 --> 00:08:43.305
(Laughter)

00:08:43.329 --> 00:08:44.479
OK, thank you.

00:08:45.756 --> 00:08:51.692
(Applause)

00:08:51.716 --> 00:08:54.477
So as you can see, we have this device

00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:58.041
that can monitor so many
physiological signals for you,

00:08:58.065 --> 00:09:01.025
and what is really interesting
about this device

00:09:01.049 --> 00:09:03.612
is that it does all this
without any wearables,

00:09:03.636 --> 00:09:06.334
without asking the person
to change his behavior

00:09:06.358 --> 00:09:08.850
or to wear anything
or charge anything special.

00:09:09.739 --> 00:09:12.707
And that got doctors very excited,

00:09:12.731 --> 00:09:13.882
because doctors,

00:09:13.906 --> 00:09:16.863
they always want to know
more information about their patients,

00:09:16.887 --> 00:09:18.057
particularly at home,

00:09:18.081 --> 00:09:20.715
and this is particularly true
in chronic diseases,

00:09:20.739 --> 00:09:24.894
like pulmonary diseases, like COPD,

00:09:24.918 --> 00:09:29.442
or heart failure or Alzheimer's
and even depression.

00:09:29.466 --> 00:09:31.783
All of these chronic diseases
are very important.

00:09:31.807 --> 00:09:34.275
In fact -- perhaps you know --

00:09:34.299 --> 00:09:37.179
two-thirds of the cost
of health care in the US

00:09:37.203 --> 00:09:39.187
is due to chronic diseases.

00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:42.076
But what is really interesting
about chronic diseases

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.920
is that when the person, for example,

00:09:43.944 --> 00:09:48.681
has a problem that leads
to the hospital and the emergency room,

00:09:48.705 --> 00:09:51.020
this problem doesn't happen overnight.

00:09:51.044 --> 00:09:53.123
Actually, things happen gradually.

00:09:53.147 --> 00:09:56.869
So if we can monitor
chronic disease patients in their home,

00:09:56.893 --> 00:10:01.154
we can detect changes in their breathing,
heartbeat, mobility, sleep --

00:10:01.178 --> 00:10:05.360
and we can detect emergencies
before they occur

00:10:05.384 --> 00:10:07.701
and have the doctor intervene earlier

00:10:07.725 --> 00:10:09.788
so that we can avoid hospitalization.

00:10:10.645 --> 00:10:14.747
And indeed, today we are working
with multiple doctors

00:10:14.771 --> 00:10:16.730
in different disease categories.

00:10:16.754 --> 00:10:17.937
So I'm really excited

00:10:17.961 --> 00:10:20.645
because we have deployed the device
with many patients.

00:10:20.669 --> 00:10:24.001
We have deployed the device
with patients that have COPD,

00:10:24.025 --> 00:10:25.532
which is a pulmonary disease,

00:10:25.556 --> 00:10:27.611
patients that have Alzheimer's,

00:10:27.635 --> 00:10:29.928
patients that have depression and anxiety

00:10:29.952 --> 00:10:31.667
and people that have Parkinson's.

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:35.681
And we are working with the doctors
on improving their life,

00:10:35.705 --> 00:10:37.546
understanding the disease better.

00:10:38.718 --> 00:10:41.289
So when I started, I told you

00:10:41.313 --> 00:10:46.733
that I'm really fascinated with Star Wars
and the Force in Star Wars,

00:10:46.757 --> 00:10:50.083
and indeed, I'm still
very much fascinated,

00:10:50.107 --> 00:10:52.113
even now, as a grown-up, with Star Wars,

00:10:52.137 --> 00:10:54.432
waiting for the next movie.

00:10:54.456 --> 00:10:59.725
But I'm very fascinated now and excited

00:10:59.749 --> 00:11:03.547
about this new Force of wireless signals,

00:11:03.571 --> 00:11:07.577
and the potential of changing
health care with this new force.

00:11:07.601 --> 00:11:10.545
One of the patients with whom
we deployed is actually my aunt.

00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:12.720
She has heart failure,

00:11:12.744 --> 00:11:16.452
and I'm sure many of you guys
in the audience

00:11:16.476 --> 00:11:21.164
have parents, grandparents,
loved ones who have chronic diseases.

00:11:21.188 --> 00:11:24.046
So I want you to imagine with me a future

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.952
where in every home
that has a chronic disease patient,

00:11:26.976 --> 00:11:30.101
there is a device like this device
sitting in the background

00:11:30.125 --> 00:11:32.490
and just monitoring passively

00:11:32.514 --> 00:11:37.180
sleep, breathing, the health
of this chronic disease patient,

00:11:37.204 --> 00:11:39.328
and before an emergency occurs,

00:11:39.352 --> 00:11:42.375
it would detect the degradation
in the physiological signal

00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:43.899
and alert the doctor

00:11:43.923 --> 00:11:45.986
so that we can avoid hospitalization.

00:11:46.652 --> 00:11:49.779
This can change health care
as we know it today,

00:11:49.803 --> 00:11:52.803
improve how we understand
chronic diseases

00:11:52.827 --> 00:11:54.596
and also save many lives.

00:11:54.898 --> 00:11:56.049
Thank you.

00:11:56.073 --> 00:12:01.207
(Applause)

00:12:01.231 --> 00:12:03.118
Helen Walters: Dina, thank you so much.

00:12:03.142 --> 00:12:04.293
Thank you too, Zach.

00:12:04.317 --> 00:12:05.628
So glad you're breathing.

00:12:05.652 --> 00:12:08.349
So Dina, this is amazing.

00:12:08.373 --> 00:12:11.401
The positive applications are incredible.

00:12:11.425 --> 00:12:15.420
What is the framework, though,
like the ethical framework around this?

00:12:15.444 --> 00:12:18.324
What are you doing to prevent
this technology from being used

00:12:18.348 --> 00:12:22.117
for other, perhaps less positive
types of applications?

00:12:22.141 --> 00:12:25.196
Dina Katabi: Yeah, this is
a very important question, of course,

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.389
like, what about misuse,

00:12:26.413 --> 00:12:30.035
or what about, I guess you could say,
about the Dark Side of the Force?

00:12:30.059 --> 00:12:31.233
HW: Right, right.

00:12:31.257 --> 00:12:33.344
(Laughter)

00:12:33.368 --> 00:12:36.867
DK: So we actually have technologies

00:12:36.891 --> 00:12:41.168
that prevent people
from trying to use this device

00:12:41.192 --> 00:12:43.546
to monitor somebody without their consent.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.823
Because the device understands space,

00:12:45.847 --> 00:12:49.268
it will ask you to prove,
by doing certain movements,

00:12:49.292 --> 00:12:51.047
that you have access to the space

00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:54.371
and you are the person
who you are asking the device to monitor.

00:12:54.395 --> 00:12:56.585
So technology-wise,

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:59.997
we have technology
that we integrate to prevent misuse,

00:13:00.021 --> 00:13:03.911
but also, I think there is a role
for policy, like everything else,

00:13:03.935 --> 00:13:09.371
and hopefully, with the two of them,
we can control any misuse.

00:13:09.395 --> 00:13:10.952
HW: Amazing. Thank you so much.

00:13:10.976 --> 00:13:12.127
DK: Thank you.

00:13:12.151 --> 00:13:15.920
(Applause)
