00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:14.960
So, for the first time
in America's modern history,

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:17.555
we have five generations
interacting at work.

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:21.166
The veterans, born between 1922 and 1943,

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.125
are known as the Greatest Generation,
the matures, the silents.

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:27.426
They're known for their self-sacrifice,

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.784
respect for authority
and work as its own reward.

00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:36.557
The boomers came shortly after,
born between 1944 and 1960.

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:39.638
This is a generation
characterized by hard work.

00:00:39.662 --> 00:00:42.906
In fact, we can thank this generation
for the term "workaholic."

00:00:43.795 --> 00:00:47.696
They appreciate competition,
they love effective communication.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.378
And they're thinking towards retirement,
if they haven't retired already.

00:00:52.402 --> 00:00:55.472
Generation X is known
as the lost generation

00:00:55.496 --> 00:00:59.744
the latchkey generation,
born between 1961 and 1980.

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:01.642
This is the smallest generation,

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.926
sandwiched between boomers
and the big millennials.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.053
More parents were divorced
in this generation

00:01:07.077 --> 00:01:09.021
than any generation prior.

00:01:09.045 --> 00:01:12.934
They also were the first generation
to tell us about work-life balance,

00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:16.022
and the first to really
ask for that in the workplace.

00:01:16.647 --> 00:01:20.251
And then millennials -- you know,
the everybody-gets-a-ribbon generation --

00:01:20.275 --> 00:01:22.950
born between 1981 and 2000.

00:01:22.974 --> 00:01:26.422
Never knew a time where technology
wasn't present in the home.

00:01:26.831 --> 00:01:30.094
They're incredibly pragmatic,
they're hopeful and they're determined.

00:01:30.118 --> 00:01:32.236
They think they're going
to change the world,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.275
in fact, I believe they're going to do it.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.696
They might be a little bit
idealistic sometimes,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.748
but in just the last several years,

00:01:38.772 --> 00:01:41.601
we've seen millennials
overtake Generation X

00:01:41.625 --> 00:01:44.482
to be the most represented
generation in the workforce.

00:01:44.506 --> 00:01:48.598
In fact, more than one in three people
in the United States labor force

00:01:48.622 --> 00:01:49.772
is a millennial.

00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:53.891
And soon to join us there,
Generation Z, born since 2000,

00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:57.277
our high school interns
or soon to be high school graduates.

00:01:57.688 --> 00:01:59.903
Now, if you open any internet browser,

00:01:59.927 --> 00:02:01.125
look at Amazon,

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.466
search any of your favorite
search engines,

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.164
you might assume there's a literal war
in the workplace, right?

00:02:07.188 --> 00:02:08.853
We see blog topics like

00:02:08.877 --> 00:02:12.204
"Seventeen reasons why millennials
are the worst generation."

00:02:12.228 --> 00:02:14.791
And "Why baby boomers
have ruined it for everybody."

00:02:14.815 --> 00:02:17.101
Or "Bridging the great
generational divide."

00:02:17.125 --> 00:02:19.283
It's like turning into this
"West Side Story,"

00:02:19.307 --> 00:02:20.800
like, boomers come in one door,

00:02:20.824 --> 00:02:22.911
millennials come in
another door, the lobby,

00:02:22.935 --> 00:02:26.348
they just fight with each other all day,
complain, go home, do the same,

00:02:26.372 --> 00:02:27.572
come back to work, right?

00:02:28.157 --> 00:02:33.723
Well, so what if I told you
these generations may not exist?

00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:37.716
I've been spending some time
thinking about this and researching this,

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.033
and fellow researchers and I
aren't exactly sure

00:02:40.057 --> 00:02:42.191
that these generations are real.

00:02:42.702 --> 00:02:46.064
And in fact, if we can agree
that these groups even exist,

00:02:46.088 --> 00:02:48.942
we certainly don't agree
who belongs in them.

00:02:49.468 --> 00:02:52.175
And they span something like 20 years.

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:53.887
So at whatever point in history,

00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:58.093
a one-year-old and a 20-year-old
are said to share the same value system,

00:02:58.117 --> 00:03:00.276
to want the same things at work,

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.133
to have the same stereotypes
working for and against them.

00:03:04.157 --> 00:03:07.887
And in fact, different areas of the world
define these generations differently.

00:03:07.911 --> 00:03:12.053
So we can't even compare generations
across various areas of the world.

00:03:12.077 --> 00:03:14.094
And these stereotypes
about each generation

00:03:14.118 --> 00:03:17.426
have, in a lot of ways,
created this self-fulfilling prophecy,

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.696
that people begin to act
as if they're part of that generation

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.712
because we've said out loud
that generation is real.

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:25.283
I'm not so sure that it is.

00:03:25.307 --> 00:03:27.636
And in fact, this idea of generations

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.784
has become deeply embedded
in United States culture.

00:03:30.808 --> 00:03:32.237
When we talk generations,

00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:34.990
people know exactly
what we're talking about.

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:37.532
In fact, people have
a lot of thoughts and feelings

00:03:37.556 --> 00:03:39.095
about each of these generations.

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:40.768
And I'll tell you how I know this.

00:03:40.792 --> 00:03:41.951
I did the thing

00:03:41.975 --> 00:03:44.910
that every red-blooded American
and pre-tenure academic does

00:03:44.934 --> 00:03:46.180
when they have a question.

00:03:46.204 --> 00:03:47.410
I Googled some stuff.

00:03:47.434 --> 00:03:49.752
And this is what I learned.

00:03:49.776 --> 00:03:51.475
Google is based on algorithms,

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:53.918
and they provide you
with commonly searched terms,

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.799
or suggested hits, based
on what other people are searching

00:03:56.823 --> 00:03:58.141
surrounding the same topic.

00:03:58.165 --> 00:04:00.744
And it gave me a really good sense
of what people think

00:04:00.768 --> 00:04:02.299
about each of these generations.

00:04:02.323 --> 00:04:03.553
Take a look.

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:06.924
I learned that baby boomers
are conservative,

00:04:06.948 --> 00:04:08.797
that Americans think they're stupid.

00:04:08.821 --> 00:04:10.640
The worst generation, they're angry,

00:04:10.664 --> 00:04:14.000
apparently they're racist
and they're so important.

00:04:14.512 --> 00:04:16.379
Looking at Generation X,

00:04:16.403 --> 00:04:18.871
I learned Generation X is a cynical group,

00:04:18.895 --> 00:04:20.403
they're angry,

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:22.915
they're known as the lost
generation -- we know this;

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:24.809
they're the smallest generation.

00:04:24.833 --> 00:04:26.425
Apparently, they're stupid too.

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:27.450
(Laughter)

00:04:27.474 --> 00:04:30.061
And mostly, they're frustrated
with baby boomers.

00:04:30.664 --> 00:04:33.196
Alright, millennials,
this is what I learned about us.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.664
So, we're obsessed with food.

00:04:34.688 --> 00:04:36.490
(Laughter)

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:40.093
We're also stupid, ah!

00:04:40.117 --> 00:04:42.545
We're lazy, we're sensitive, we're fired,

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:44.770
we're also hated,
and we think we're important.

00:04:44.794 --> 00:04:47.982
And perhaps the most terrifying
search result on the internet --

00:04:48.006 --> 00:04:50.252
Generation Z is screwed.

00:04:50.276 --> 00:04:53.426
(Laughter)

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.121
OK, so, for five years,
I've been talking to leaders and followers

00:04:58.145 --> 00:05:00.640
across a wide variety of organizations.

00:05:00.664 --> 00:05:02.958
And this is what I've come to realize.

00:05:02.982 --> 00:05:05.577
Generations haven't become
part of the conversation --

00:05:05.601 --> 00:05:09.353
generations have become
the conversation at work.

00:05:09.377 --> 00:05:10.527
What I've learned

00:05:10.551 --> 00:05:14.624
is that we're working under the assumption
that those Google results are true.

00:05:15.735 --> 00:05:20.775
And so, what I think
is that organizations are now desperate

00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:24.593
to figure out how to "manage"
the multigenerational workplace.

00:05:24.617 --> 00:05:25.966
"Manage" it.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.783
We manage all sorts of things.

00:05:27.807 --> 00:05:31.212
We're preparing for this
wave of millennials to come to work.

00:05:31.236 --> 00:05:33.418
So we prepare for hurricanes, right?

00:05:33.442 --> 00:05:36.720
We prepare to take the MCAT,
we prepare for natural disasters.

00:05:36.744 --> 00:05:39.474
Why are we preparing
for 23-year-olds to come to work?

00:05:39.498 --> 00:05:40.593
(Laughter)

00:05:40.617 --> 00:05:42.320
I've talked to these organizations,

00:05:42.344 --> 00:05:44.951
and I've heard amazing things
that they're doing

00:05:44.975 --> 00:05:47.707
to create a workspace
for everybody to get along

00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:51.045
and to have autonomy
and to feel like they're thriving.

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:53.943
But I've also heard some
really incredibly harebrained ideas

00:05:53.967 --> 00:05:56.506
about how to navigate
the multigenerational workplace.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.681
Are you ready?

00:05:57.705 --> 00:05:58.870
This is what I saw.

00:05:58.894 --> 00:06:00.147
I visited an organization,

00:06:00.181 --> 00:06:04.244
and they adopted this idea
that if you can see it, you can be it.

00:06:04.268 --> 00:06:06.141
A really important concept.

00:06:06.165 --> 00:06:07.506
But I think they blew it.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.403
The put pictures on the walls
of the ideal multigenerational workplace,

00:06:11.427 --> 00:06:14.160
because if you can see it, you can be it.

00:06:14.767 --> 00:06:17.617
(Laughter)

00:06:17.641 --> 00:06:18.799
Or like this one.

00:06:18.823 --> 00:06:20.966
(Laughter)

00:06:21.528 --> 00:06:23.449
Like, I don't even want to work here.

00:06:23.473 --> 00:06:24.498
(Laughter)

00:06:24.522 --> 00:06:27.696
You don't get to wear
color here, apparently,

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.522
and HR seriously has problems
with people jumping in heels,

00:06:30.546 --> 00:06:32.104
I promise you that, OK?

00:06:32.553 --> 00:06:35.490
I talked to an organization
who recently decided

00:06:35.514 --> 00:06:38.205
against putting a ball pit
in the break room

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:40.829
because that's how you retain millennials.

00:06:41.307 --> 00:06:43.379
We're 30, not three.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:44.768
(Laughter)

00:06:44.792 --> 00:06:49.458
And in fact, I know a young,
at the time, millennial,

00:06:49.482 --> 00:06:53.553
who was told that if she wanted
people to take her seriously,

00:06:53.577 --> 00:06:57.069
just because she was a millennial,
she would have to do this --

00:06:57.093 --> 00:06:58.753
wear shoulder pads.

00:06:59.244 --> 00:07:00.395
Yes.

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:03.847
People younger than her and older than her
wouldn't take her seriously

00:07:03.871 --> 00:07:06.149
unless she wore shoulder pads.

00:07:06.173 --> 00:07:07.323
Straight-out-of-the-80s,

00:07:07.347 --> 00:07:09.926
can't-even-buy-them-anywhere
shoulder pads.

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.750
This young woman had two graduate degrees.

00:07:13.117 --> 00:07:14.717
This young woman was me.

00:07:16.268 --> 00:07:18.530
And this is the best we came up with?

00:07:18.554 --> 00:07:22.712
How to navigate the multigenerational
workplace ... is shoulder pads?

00:07:22.736 --> 00:07:24.561
(Laughter)

00:07:24.585 --> 00:07:27.665
So, this is also what I've learned
talking to organizations

00:07:27.689 --> 00:07:31.164
that employ a wide range
of people of various ages.

00:07:31.498 --> 00:07:34.167
We are so much more similar
than we are different.

00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:36.611
And we're hearing this consistently.

00:07:36.635 --> 00:07:39.373
People want work that matters,
they want flexibility,

00:07:39.397 --> 00:07:41.405
they want support, they want appreciation,

00:07:41.429 --> 00:07:42.595
they want better coffee.

00:07:42.619 --> 00:07:46.029
But none of these things
are tied to a generation.

00:07:46.053 --> 00:07:49.069
Now, sure, we see small differences
in what people want.

00:07:49.093 --> 00:07:52.695
We know 20-year-olds and 60-year-olds
go home and do different things.

00:07:52.719 --> 00:07:54.235
They have different values.

00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:57.313
At least when it comes
to things happening outside of work.

00:07:57.854 --> 00:07:59.390
But I think what's happened

00:07:59.414 --> 00:08:02.053
is that this focus
on generational cohorts,

00:08:02.077 --> 00:08:03.426
these groups of people,

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:07.871
has created a space where we just forgot
that people are people.

00:08:09.061 --> 00:08:12.270
And to know who they really are,
who we really work with,

00:08:12.294 --> 00:08:14.358
we have to figure out
how to better navigate

00:08:14.382 --> 00:08:15.985
this multigenerational workplace

00:08:16.009 --> 00:08:17.606
than ball pits.

00:08:18.437 --> 00:08:21.831
Call me one of those idealist millennials,
but I think we can get there.

00:08:21.855 --> 00:08:25.455
And I don't think the idea
is too terribly difficult.

00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:29.974
What if we radically, simply, not easily,

00:08:29.998 --> 00:08:31.798
meet people where they are?

00:08:32.482 --> 00:08:33.982
Individualize our approach.

00:08:34.006 --> 00:08:35.537
I've never met a generation.

00:08:35.561 --> 00:08:37.085
I've had a lot of conversations

00:08:37.109 --> 00:08:40.775
with people who happened to identify
with a specific generational cohort.

00:08:41.538 --> 00:08:44.307
I know that 80-year-olds text message

00:08:44.331 --> 00:08:46.442
and 23-year-olds crochet blankets.

00:08:46.466 --> 00:08:49.933
None of these things are stereotypical
of that generation, right?

00:08:49.957 --> 00:08:52.768
Nilofer Merchant --
she's a thought leader in innovation --

00:08:52.792 --> 00:08:55.909
she tells us we have to meet people
in their onlyness,

00:08:55.933 --> 00:08:58.672
that is, that spot in the world
where only we stand,

00:08:58.696 --> 00:09:03.097
as a function of our unique history,
our experiences and our hopes.

00:09:03.887 --> 00:09:06.516
But this requires
flexibility and curiosity.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.080
And what happens when we meet
people in their onlyness,

00:09:10.104 --> 00:09:12.262
only the spot in the world
that they stand,

00:09:12.286 --> 00:09:17.212
we learn that that boomer who is just
acting "angry" at work all the time

00:09:17.236 --> 00:09:18.847
is scared.

00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:22.950
Because he's worked every day
since he was 16 years old,

00:09:22.974 --> 00:09:25.768
and on a Monday,
sooner than he can imagine,

00:09:25.792 --> 00:09:27.537
he'll never go to work again.

00:09:27.895 --> 00:09:29.061
He's got plans.

00:09:29.085 --> 00:09:31.061
It's going to take like a week and a half

00:09:31.085 --> 00:09:33.362
to do all the things
on that retirement list.

00:09:33.736 --> 00:09:35.085
But then what?

00:09:35.109 --> 00:09:36.918
What if we give a little bit of grace

00:09:36.942 --> 00:09:39.024
to the person that might be
a little scared?

00:09:40.175 --> 00:09:42.445
Or that Generation X-er

00:09:42.469 --> 00:09:46.159
who has four drop-offs,
three kids, two hands,

00:09:46.183 --> 00:09:48.474
and is just trying to keep
the wheels on the bus.

00:09:48.498 --> 00:09:50.529
Sure, maybe she's a little aloof at work.

00:09:50.553 --> 00:09:53.251
Maybe she's a little independent,
maybe she's exhausted.

00:09:53.577 --> 00:09:54.855
Or that millennial

00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:58.371
who asks for a raise after two months
because they're "entitled?"

00:09:58.395 --> 00:10:00.959
Well, maybe it's because
that generation has more debt

00:10:00.983 --> 00:10:03.863
than any generation before them,
coming out of college,

00:10:03.887 --> 00:10:06.260
and they just need the money

00:10:06.284 --> 00:10:08.084
to keep going, to pay rent.

00:10:08.847 --> 00:10:11.689
And suddenly, when you meet people
in their onlyness,

00:10:11.713 --> 00:10:13.586
that spot in the world only they stand,

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.712
we're not talking
about a generation anymore.

00:10:15.736 --> 00:10:18.900
We're talking about Jim or Jen or Candice.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.493
And so here's my challenge to us.

00:10:21.855 --> 00:10:25.343
Pick a person, just one,
and explore their onlyness.

00:10:25.744 --> 00:10:26.895
And then learn.

00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:29.450
And then in the moments
where it's appropriate, teach.

00:10:29.474 --> 00:10:32.989
And figure out what they bring to work
that no one else can bring to work,

00:10:33.013 --> 00:10:34.871
because that's what makes work richer.

00:10:34.895 --> 00:10:36.296
And then do it again.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.496
And do it again.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.441
And then some day, we're not
working with generations anymore.

00:10:40.465 --> 00:10:42.148
We're working with people.

00:10:42.172 --> 00:10:45.664
And so to really understand the beauty
of the multigenerational workplace,

00:10:45.688 --> 00:10:48.379
I think we just have to meet
people where they are.

00:10:48.403 --> 00:10:52.236
And that doesn't require
that we unpack and live there with them.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.743
But we might find, at least on occasion,
it's a beautiful place to visit.

00:10:56.331 --> 00:10:58.586
And so I think there's just no need

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.386
to argue about which generation
is the most angry

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.404
or the most entitled
or the most so obsessed with food.

00:11:04.966 --> 00:11:07.910
We all come to the classroom,
to work, back to our homes,

00:11:07.934 --> 00:11:10.686
a little bit tired and a little bit
tattered sometimes.

00:11:11.093 --> 00:11:14.202
Maybe let's just do our best
to humbly meet people where they are,

00:11:14.226 --> 00:11:15.863
how they show up that day,

00:11:15.887 --> 00:11:17.154
generation and all.

00:11:17.665 --> 00:11:18.815
And in those moments

00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:22.585
where it can feel a little bit
like intergenerational warfare,

00:11:22.609 --> 00:11:25.270
I think we can at least all agree

00:11:25.294 --> 00:11:27.532
that shoulder pads aren't the solution.

00:11:27.556 --> 00:11:29.095
(Laughter)

00:11:29.119 --> 00:11:30.278
Thank you.

00:11:30.302 --> 00:11:34.031
(Applause)
