00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:16.346
I met 273 start-up founders last year.

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:18.952
And each one was looking for money.

00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:20.413
As a tech investor,

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:23.101
my goal was to sort through
everyone that I met

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:24.760
and make a quick determination

00:00:24.784 --> 00:00:28.267
about which ones had the potential
to make something really big.

00:00:28.887 --> 00:00:30.591
But what makes a great founder?

00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:32.824
This is a question I ask myself daily.

00:00:33.186 --> 00:00:35.043
Some venture capitalists place bets

00:00:35.067 --> 00:00:37.472
based on a founder's previous background.

00:00:37.496 --> 00:00:39.448
Did they go to an Ivy League school?

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:41.395
Have they worked at a blue-chip company?

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:43.363
Have they built out a big vision before?

00:00:43.387 --> 00:00:45.920
Effectively, how smart is this person?

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:50.391
Other VCs asses a founder's
emotional quotient, or EQ.

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:52.742
How well will this person build teams

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:55.670
and build rapport
across customers and clients?

00:00:56.496 --> 00:00:59.639
I have a different methodology
to assess start-up founders, though,

00:00:59.663 --> 00:01:01.228
and it's not complicated.

00:01:01.252 --> 00:01:03.852
I look for signs of one specific trait.

00:01:04.204 --> 00:01:06.341
Not IQ, not EQ.

00:01:06.688 --> 00:01:07.888
It's adaptability:

00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:12.314
how well a person reacts
to the inevitability of change,

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:13.514
and lots of it.

00:01:13.538 --> 00:01:15.967
That's the single most important
determinant for me.

00:01:16.378 --> 00:01:17.903
I subscribe to the belief

00:01:17.927 --> 00:01:21.094
that adaptability itself
is a form of intelligence,

00:01:21.118 --> 00:01:24.054
and our adaptability quotient, or AQ,

00:01:24.078 --> 00:01:27.546
is something that can be measured,
tested and improved.

00:01:28.301 --> 00:01:30.953
AQ isn't just useful
for start-up founders, however.

00:01:31.447 --> 00:01:33.899
I think it's increasingly
important for all of us.

00:01:33.923 --> 00:01:35.749
Because the world is speeding up.

00:01:35.773 --> 00:01:38.963
We know that the rate
of technological change is accelerating,

00:01:38.987 --> 00:01:41.220
which is forcing our brains to react.

00:01:41.244 --> 00:01:43.586
Whether you're navigating
changing job conditions

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.029
brought on by automation,

00:01:45.053 --> 00:01:48.205
shifting geopolitics
in a more globalized world,

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.619
or simply changing family dynamics
and personal relationships.

00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:54.537
Each of us, as individuals, groups,

00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:56.807
corporations and even governments

00:01:56.831 --> 00:01:59.212
are being forced to grapple
with more change

00:01:59.236 --> 00:02:01.503
than ever before in human history.

00:02:02.014 --> 00:02:04.547
So, how do we assess our adaptability?

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:08.043
I use three tricks
when meeting with founders.

00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:09.456
Here's the first.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.154
Think back to your
most recent job interview.

00:02:12.178 --> 00:02:14.416
What kind of questions were you asked?

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.579
Probably some variation of,
"Tell me about a time when," right?

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:22.037
Instead, to interview for adaptability,

00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:24.561
I like to ask "what if" questions.

00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:27.363
What if your main revenue stream
were to dry up overnight?

00:02:27.387 --> 00:02:29.776
What if a heat wave prevented
every single customer

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.752
from being able to visit your store?

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:34.987
Asking "what if," instead
of asking about the past,

00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:36.829
forces the brain to simulate.

00:02:36.853 --> 00:02:39.694
To picture multiple possible
versions of the future.

00:02:39.718 --> 00:02:41.122
The strength of that vision,

00:02:41.146 --> 00:02:45.091
as well as how many distinct scenarios
someone can conjure, tells me a lot.

00:02:46.175 --> 00:02:49.754
Practicing simulations
is a sort of safe testing ground

00:02:49.778 --> 00:02:51.818
for improving adaptability.

00:02:51.842 --> 00:02:55.818
Instead of testing how you take in
and retain information,

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.604
like an IQ test might,

00:02:57.628 --> 00:02:59.993
it tests how you manipulate information,

00:03:00.017 --> 00:03:01.200
given a constraint,

00:03:01.224 --> 00:03:03.215
in order to achieve a specific goal.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.672
The second trick that I use
to assess adaptability in founders

00:03:08.696 --> 00:03:11.030
is to look for signs of unlearning.

00:03:11.538 --> 00:03:15.839
Active unlearners seek to challenge
what they presume to already know,

00:03:15.863 --> 00:03:19.396
and instead, override that data
with new information.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.505
Kind of like a computer
running a disk cleanup.

00:03:23.053 --> 00:03:25.156
Take the example of Destin Sandlin,

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.688
who programed his bicycle
to turn left when he steered it right

00:03:28.712 --> 00:03:30.077
and vice versa.

00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:32.037
He called this his Backwards Brain Bike,

00:03:32.061 --> 00:03:34.006
and it took him nearly eight months

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.030
just to learn how to ride it
kind of, sort of normally.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.910
The fact that Destin was able
to unlearn his regular bike

00:03:40.934 --> 00:03:42.656
in favor of a new one, though,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.206
signals something awesome
about our adaptability.

00:03:45.656 --> 00:03:47.061
It's not fixed.

00:03:47.085 --> 00:03:50.252
Instead, each of us
has the capacity to improve it,

00:03:50.276 --> 00:03:52.688
through dedication and hard work.

00:03:52.712 --> 00:03:56.603
On the last page of Gandhi's
autobiography, he wrote,

00:03:56.627 --> 00:03:59.159
"I must reduce myself to zero."

00:03:59.903 --> 00:04:02.506
At many points in his very full life,

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.807
he was still seeking to return
to a beginner's mindset, to zero.

00:04:06.831 --> 00:04:08.220
To unlearn.

00:04:08.244 --> 00:04:11.077
In this way, I think
it's pretty safe to say

00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:12.949
Gandhi had a high AQ score.

00:04:12.973 --> 00:04:14.125
(Laughter)

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:15.458
The third and final trick

00:04:15.482 --> 00:04:18.149
that I use to assess
a founder's adaptability

00:04:18.173 --> 00:04:21.053
is to look for people
who infuse exploration

00:04:21.077 --> 00:04:23.315
into their life and their business.

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:28.082
There's a sort of natural tension
between exploration and exploitation.

00:04:28.106 --> 00:04:29.360
And collectively,

00:04:29.384 --> 00:04:32.161
all of us tend to overvalue exploitation.

00:04:32.185 --> 00:04:33.452
Here's what I mean.

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:35.363
In the year 2000,

00:04:35.387 --> 00:04:38.617
a man finagled his way
into a meeting with John Antioco,

00:04:38.641 --> 00:04:40.355
the CEO of Blockbuster,

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:41.950
and proposed a partnership

00:04:41.974 --> 00:04:45.109
to manage Blockbuster's
fledgling online business.

00:04:45.133 --> 00:04:48.498
The CEO John laughed him
out of the room, saying,

00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:50.579
"I have millions of existing customers

00:04:50.603 --> 00:04:52.984
and thousands of successful retail stores.

00:04:53.008 --> 00:04:54.969
I really need to focus on the money."

00:04:55.373 --> 00:04:57.191
The other man in the meeting, however,

00:04:57.215 --> 00:05:00.103
turned out to be Reed Hastings,
the CEO of Netflix.

00:05:00.683 --> 00:05:04.696
In 2018, Netflix brought in
15.8 billion dollars,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.061
while Blockbuster
filed for bankruptcy in 2010,

00:05:09.085 --> 00:05:11.117
directly 10 years after that meeting.

00:05:11.736 --> 00:05:13.172
The Blockbuster CEO

00:05:13.196 --> 00:05:16.979
was too focused on exploiting
his already successful business model,

00:05:17.003 --> 00:05:19.868
so much so that he couldn't see
around the next corner.

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.399
In that way, his previous success

00:05:22.423 --> 00:05:25.222
became the enemy
of his adaptability potential.

00:05:25.717 --> 00:05:27.466
For the founders that I work with,

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.855
I frame exploration
as a state of constant seeking.

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:33.023
To never fall too far in love
with your wins

00:05:33.047 --> 00:05:37.224
but rather continue to proactively
seek out what might kill you next.

00:05:38.192 --> 00:05:40.629
When I first started
exploring adaptability,

00:05:40.653 --> 00:05:43.433
the thing I found most exciting
is that we can improve it.

00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:46.610
Each of us has the capacity
to become more adaptable.

00:05:47.109 --> 00:05:48.585
But think of it like a muscle:

00:05:48.609 --> 00:05:50.522
it's got to be exercised.

00:05:50.546 --> 00:05:53.117
And don't get discouraged
if it takes a while.

00:05:53.141 --> 00:05:54.734
Remember Destin Sandlin?

00:05:54.758 --> 00:05:57.774
It took him eight months
just to learn how to ride a bike.

00:05:57.798 --> 00:06:01.131
Over time, using the tricks
that I use on founders --

00:06:01.155 --> 00:06:04.379
asking "what if" questions,
actively unlearning

00:06:04.403 --> 00:06:08.371
and prioritizing exploration
over exploitation

00:06:08.395 --> 00:06:10.085
can put you in the driver's seat --

00:06:10.109 --> 00:06:12.561
so that the next time
something big changes,

00:06:12.585 --> 00:06:14.185
you're already prepared.

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:17.759
We're entering a future where IQ and EQ

00:06:17.783 --> 00:06:21.418
both matter way less
than how fast you're able to adapt.

00:06:21.442 --> 00:06:24.428
So I hope that these tools
help you to raise your own AQ.

00:06:24.982 --> 00:06:26.133
Thank you.

00:06:26.157 --> 00:06:30.079
(Applause)
