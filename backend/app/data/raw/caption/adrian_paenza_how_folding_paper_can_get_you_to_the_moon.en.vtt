00:00:14.335 --> 00:00:17.078
How many times can you
fold a piece of paper?

00:00:17.102 --> 00:00:20.599
Assume that one had a piece
of paper that was very fine,

00:00:20.623 --> 00:00:23.484
like the kind they typically
use to print the Bible.

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:28.332
In reality, it seems like a piece of silk.

00:00:28.356 --> 00:00:29.976
To qualify these ideas,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.444
let's say you have a paper

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:34.551
that's one-thousandth
of a centimeter in thickness.

00:00:35.462 --> 00:00:38.889
That is 10 to the power
of minus three centimeters,

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:42.220
which equals .001 centimeters.

00:00:43.453 --> 00:00:46.362
Let's also assume that you have
a big piece of paper,

00:00:46.386 --> 00:00:47.976
like a page out of the newspaper.

00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:51.679
Now we begin to fold it in half.

00:00:52.514 --> 00:00:55.181
How many times do you think
it could be folded like that?

00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:57.084
And another question:

00:00:57.887 --> 00:01:01.795
If you could fold the paper over and over,
as many times as you wish,

00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:03.116
say 30 times,

00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:06.155
what would you imagine
the thickness of the paper would be then?

00:01:07.155 --> 00:01:08.730
Before you move on,

00:01:08.754 --> 00:01:12.976
I encourage you to actually think
about a possible answer to this question.

00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:15.065
OK.

00:01:15.089 --> 00:01:17.150
After we have folded the paper once,

00:01:17.174 --> 00:01:20.501
it is now two thousandths
of a centimeter in thickness.

00:01:21.425 --> 00:01:23.837
If we fold it in half once again,

00:01:23.861 --> 00:01:26.976
the paper will become
four thousandths of a centimeter.

00:01:27.817 --> 00:01:31.167
With every fold we make,
the paper doubles in thickness.

00:01:32.356 --> 00:01:35.063
And if we continue to fold
it again and again,

00:01:35.087 --> 00:01:38.839
always in half, we would confront
the following situation

00:01:38.863 --> 00:01:39.976
after 10 folds.

00:01:40.839 --> 00:01:42.827
Two to the power of 10,

00:01:42.851 --> 00:01:46.415
meaning that you multiply
two by itself 10 times,

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.968
is one thousand and
24 thousandths of a centimeter,

00:01:50.992 --> 00:01:54.067
which is a little bit over one centimeter.

00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:56.254
Assume we continue folding
the paper in half.

00:01:57.251 --> 00:01:58.976
What will happen then?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.976
If we fold it 17 times,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.976
we'll get a thickness
of two to the power of 17,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.719
which is 131 centimeters,

00:02:07.743 --> 00:02:09.672
and that equals just over four feet.

00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:12.976
If we were able to fold it 25 times,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.976
then we would get two to the power of 25,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.263
which is 33,554 centimeters,

00:02:21.287 --> 00:02:23.115
just over 1,100 feet.

00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:27.976
That would make it almost
as tall as the Empire State Building.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.976
It's worthwhile to stop here
and reflect for a moment.

00:02:32.965 --> 00:02:37.546
Folding a paper in half, even a paper
as fine as that of the Bible,

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.976
25 times would give us a paper
almost a quarter of a mile.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.015
What do we learn?

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.631
This type of growth
is called exponential growth,

00:02:47.655 --> 00:02:49.976
and as you see, just by folding a paper

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.158
we can go very far, but very fast too.

00:02:54.347 --> 00:02:58.709
Summarizing, if we fold a paper 25 times,

00:02:58.733 --> 00:03:00.976
the thickness is almost
a quarter of a mile.

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:06.186
30 times, the thickness reaches 6.5 miles,

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.916
which is about the average
height that planes fly.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.976
40 times, the thickness
is nearly 7,000 miles,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.851
or the average GPS satellite's orbit.

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:19.427
48 times, the thickness
is way over one million miles.

00:03:20.527 --> 00:03:24.228
Now, if you think that the distance
between the Earth and the Moon

00:03:24.252 --> 00:03:27.041
is less than 250,000 miles,

00:03:27.065 --> 00:03:29.473
then starting with a piece of Bible paper

00:03:29.497 --> 00:03:32.976
and folding it 45 times,
we get to the Moon.

00:03:34.108 --> 00:03:36.699
And if we double it one more time,

00:03:36.723 --> 00:03:38.000
we get back to Earth.
