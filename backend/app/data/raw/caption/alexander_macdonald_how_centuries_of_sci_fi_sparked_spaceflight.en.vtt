00:00:12.858 --> 00:00:16.635
I want to tell you a story about stories.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.033
And I want to tell you this story
because I think we need to remember

00:00:21.057 --> 00:00:23.249
that sometimes the stories
we tell each other

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:27.686
are more than just tales
or entertainment or narratives.

00:00:28.482 --> 00:00:30.188
They're also vehicles

00:00:30.212 --> 00:00:34.081
for sowing inspiration
and ideas across our societies

00:00:34.105 --> 00:00:35.608
and across time.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.292
The story I'm about to tell you

00:00:38.316 --> 00:00:41.381
is about how one of the most advanced
technological achievements

00:00:41.405 --> 00:00:42.557
of the modern era

00:00:42.581 --> 00:00:44.185
has its roots in stories,

00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:49.668
and how some of the most important
transformations yet to come might also.

00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:53.065
The story begins over 300 years ago,

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.385
when Galileo Galilei first learned
of the recent Dutch invention

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.079
that took two pieces of shaped glass
and put them in a long tube

00:01:02.103 --> 00:01:04.966
and thereby extended human sight
farther than ever before.

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:09.873
When Galileo turned
his new telescope to the heavens

00:01:09.897 --> 00:01:11.459
and to the Moon in particular,

00:01:12.418 --> 00:01:14.148
he discovered something incredible.

00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:19.843
These are pages from Galileo's book
"Sidereus Nuncius," published in 1610.

00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:23.748
And in them, he revealed to the world
what he had discovered.

00:01:23.772 --> 00:01:27.235
And what he discovered was that the Moon
was not just a celestial object

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.410
wandering across the night sky,

00:01:29.434 --> 00:01:32.294
but rather, it was a world,

00:01:32.318 --> 00:01:35.552
a world with high, sunlit mountains

00:01:35.576 --> 00:01:39.013
and dark "mare," the Latin word for seas.

00:01:40.075 --> 00:01:42.958
And once this new world
and the Moon had been discovered,

00:01:42.982 --> 00:01:47.061
people immediately began
to think about how to travel there.

00:01:47.085 --> 00:01:49.286
And just as importantly,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.395
they began to write stories

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:53.261
about how that might happen

00:01:53.285 --> 00:01:55.179
and what those voyages might be like.

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.126
One of the first people to do so
was actually the Bishop of Hereford,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.811
a man named Francis Godwin.

00:02:00.835 --> 00:02:03.310
Godwin wrote a story
about a Spanish explorer,

00:02:03.334 --> 00:02:04.847
Domingo Gonsales,

00:02:04.871 --> 00:02:07.675
who ended up marooned
on the island of St. Helena

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:09.161
in the middle of the Atlantic,

00:02:09.185 --> 00:02:10.987
and there, in an effort to get home,

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.066
developed a machine, an invention,

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.997
to harness the power
of the local wild geese

00:02:17.021 --> 00:02:18.654
to allow him to fly --

00:02:18.678 --> 00:02:21.596
and eventually to embark
on a voyage to the Moon.

00:02:22.016 --> 00:02:26.397
Godwin's book, "The Man in the Moone,
or a Discourse of a Voyage Thither,"

00:02:26.421 --> 00:02:30.293
was only published posthumously
and anonymously in 1638,

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:34.102
likely on account of the number
of controversial ideas that it contained,

00:02:34.126 --> 00:02:37.160
including an endorsement
of the Copernican view of the universe

00:02:37.184 --> 00:02:39.928
that put the Sun at the center
of the Solar System,

00:02:39.952 --> 00:02:42.535
as well as a pre-Newtonian
concept of gravity

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:45.500
that had the idea
that the weight of an object

00:02:45.524 --> 00:02:48.272
would decrease with increasing
distance from Earth.

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:51.599
And that's to say nothing
of his idea of a goose machine

00:02:51.623 --> 00:02:53.049
that could go to the Moon.

00:02:53.073 --> 00:02:54.708
(Laughter)

00:02:54.732 --> 00:02:57.572
And while this idea of a voyage
to the Moon by goose machine

00:02:57.596 --> 00:03:01.739
might not seem particularly insightful
or technically creative to us today,

00:03:01.763 --> 00:03:06.093
what's important is that Godwin described
getting to the Moon not by a dream

00:03:06.117 --> 00:03:09.498
or by magic, as Johannes Kepler
had written about,

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:12.383
but rather, through human invention.

00:03:12.407 --> 00:03:15.610
And it was this idea
that we could build machines

00:03:15.634 --> 00:03:17.525
that could travel into the heavens,

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.453
that would plant its seed
in minds across the generations.

00:03:22.174 --> 00:03:25.053
The idea was next taken up
by his contemporary, John Wilkins,

00:03:25.077 --> 00:03:26.834
then just a young student at Oxford,

00:03:26.858 --> 00:03:29.423
but later, one of the founders
of the Royal Society.

00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:34.126
John Wilkins took the idea of space travel
in Godwin's text seriously

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.224
and wrote not just another story

00:03:36.248 --> 00:03:39.114
but a nonfiction philosophical treatise,

00:03:39.138 --> 00:03:41.732
entitled, "Discovery
of the New World in the Moon,

00:03:41.756 --> 00:03:44.109
or, a Discourse Tending to Prove

00:03:44.133 --> 00:03:48.068
that 'tis Probable There May Be
Another Habitable World in that Planet."

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.115
And note, by the way,
that word "habitable."

00:03:51.462 --> 00:03:54.129
That idea in itself would have
been a powerful incentive

00:03:54.153 --> 00:03:57.377
for people thinking about how to build
machines that could go there.

00:03:57.795 --> 00:04:01.212
In his books, Wilkins seriously considered
a number of technical methods

00:04:01.236 --> 00:04:02.521
for spaceflight,

00:04:02.545 --> 00:04:06.116
and it remains to this day
the earliest known nonfiction account

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.114
of how we might travel to the Moon.

00:04:08.138 --> 00:04:11.376
Other stories would soon follow,
most notably by Cyrano de Bergerac,

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.799
with his "Lunar Tales."

00:04:12.823 --> 00:04:15.847
By the mid-17th century,
the idea of people building machines

00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:18.034
that could travel to the heavens

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:21.111
was growing in complexity
and technical nuance.

00:04:22.152 --> 00:04:24.986
And yet, in the late 17th century,

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.741
this intellectual progress
effectively ceased.

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.813
People still told stories
about getting to the Moon,

00:04:30.837 --> 00:04:32.540
but they relied on the old ideas

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:35.591
or, once again, on dreams or on magic.

00:04:36.203 --> 00:04:37.646
Why?

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.321
Well, because the discovery
of the laws of gravity by Newton

00:04:41.345 --> 00:04:46.003
and the invention of the vacuum pump
by Robert Hooke and Robert Boyle

00:04:46.027 --> 00:04:47.586
meant that people now understood

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.815
that a condition of vacuum
existed between the planets,

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:53.477
and consequentially
between the Earth and the Moon.

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:55.929
And they had no way of overcoming this,

00:04:55.953 --> 00:04:58.330
no way of thinking about overcoming this.

00:04:58.354 --> 00:05:00.231
And so, for well over a century,

00:05:00.255 --> 00:05:04.025
the idea of a voyage to the Moon
made very little intellectual progress

00:05:04.602 --> 00:05:07.124
until the rise of
the Industrial Revolution

00:05:07.148 --> 00:05:09.899
and the development
of steam engines and boilers

00:05:09.923 --> 00:05:12.236
and most importantly, pressure vessels.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.119
And these gave people the tools to think
about how they could build a capsule

00:05:17.143 --> 00:05:19.352
that could resist the vacuum of space.

00:05:20.371 --> 00:05:23.575
So it was in this context, in 1835,

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.584
that the next great story
of spaceflight was written,

00:05:26.608 --> 00:05:27.907
by Edgar Allan Poe.

00:05:28.452 --> 00:05:31.833
Now, today we think of Poe
in terms of gothic poems

00:05:31.857 --> 00:05:33.734
and telltale hearts and ravens.

00:05:34.084 --> 00:05:36.322
But he considered himself
a technical thinker.

00:05:36.788 --> 00:05:38.271
He grew up in Baltimore,

00:05:38.295 --> 00:05:40.665
the first American city
with gas street lighting,

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:43.208
and he was fascinated
by the technological revolution

00:05:43.232 --> 00:05:45.071
that he saw going on all around him.

00:05:45.095 --> 00:05:48.780
He considered his own greatest work
not to be one of his gothic tales

00:05:48.804 --> 00:05:51.360
but rather his epic prose poem "Eureka,"

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:53.620
in which he expounded
his own personal view

00:05:53.644 --> 00:05:56.346
of the cosmographical nature
of the universe.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.826
In his stories, he would describe
in fantastical technical detail

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.755
machines and contraptions,

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:06.541
and nowhere was he more influential
in this than in his short story,

00:06:06.565 --> 00:06:09.786
"The Unparalleled Adventure
of One Hans Pfaall."

00:06:10.585 --> 00:06:13.279
It's a story of an unemployed
bellows maker in Rotterdam,

00:06:13.303 --> 00:06:16.756
who, depressed and tired of life --
this is Poe, after all --

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.407
and deeply in debt,

00:06:18.431 --> 00:06:22.761
he decides to build a hermetically
enclosed balloon-borne carriage

00:06:22.785 --> 00:06:25.229
that is launched into the air by dynamite

00:06:25.253 --> 00:06:27.935
and from there, floats
through the vacuum of space

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:29.757
all the way to the lunar surface.

00:06:30.575 --> 00:06:33.523
And importantly, he did not
develop this story alone,

00:06:33.547 --> 00:06:35.104
for in the appendix to his tale,

00:06:35.128 --> 00:06:38.819
he explicitly acknowledged Godwin's
"A Man in the Moone"

00:06:38.843 --> 00:06:41.622
from over 200 years earlier

00:06:41.646 --> 00:06:43.234
as an influence,

00:06:43.258 --> 00:06:46.681
calling it "a singular and somewhat
ingenious little book."

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.685
And although this idea of a balloon-borne
voyage to the Moon may seem

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:54.714
not much more technically sophisticated
than the goose machine,

00:06:55.698 --> 00:06:58.812
in fact, Poe was sufficiently detailed

00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:02.028
in the description
of the construction of the device

00:07:02.052 --> 00:07:05.512
and in terms of the orbital
dynamics of the voyage

00:07:05.536 --> 00:07:09.954
that it could be diagrammed
in the very first spaceflight encyclopedia

00:07:09.978 --> 00:07:12.492
as a mission in the 1920s.

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:18.062
And it was this attention to detail,
or to "verisimilitude," as he called it,

00:07:18.086 --> 00:07:20.157
that would influence the next great story:

00:07:20.678 --> 00:07:23.969
Jules Verne's "From the Earth
to the Moon," written in 1865.

00:07:24.545 --> 00:07:27.144
And it's a story that has
a remarkable legacy

00:07:27.168 --> 00:07:30.194
and a remarkable similarity
to the real voyages to the Moon

00:07:30.218 --> 00:07:32.724
that would take place
over a hundred years later.

00:07:32.748 --> 00:07:37.643
Because in the story, the first voyage
to the Moon takes place from Florida,

00:07:37.667 --> 00:07:40.074
with three people on board,

00:07:40.098 --> 00:07:42.169
in a trip that takes three days --

00:07:42.193 --> 00:07:46.325
exactly the parameters that would prevail
during the Apollo program itself.

00:07:47.268 --> 00:07:50.316
And in an explicit tribute
to Poe's influence on him,

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:54.686
Verne situated the group responsible
for this feat in the book in Baltimore,

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.086
at the Baltimore Gun Club,

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.527
with its members shouting,
"Cheers for Edgar Poe!"

00:07:58.551 --> 00:08:02.091
as they began to lay out their plans
for their conquest of the Moon.

00:08:02.115 --> 00:08:04.600
And just as Verne was influenced by Poe,

00:08:04.624 --> 00:08:08.125
so, too, would Verne's own story
go on to influence and inspire

00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:10.374
the first generation of rocket scientists.

00:08:10.398 --> 00:08:13.888
The two great pioneers of liquid fuel
rocketry in Russia and in Germany,

00:08:13.912 --> 00:08:16.367
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and Hermann Oberth,

00:08:16.391 --> 00:08:19.301
both traced their own commitment
to the field of spaceflight

00:08:19.325 --> 00:08:22.105
to their reading "From the Earth
to the Moon" as teenagers,

00:08:22.129 --> 00:08:24.130
and then subsequently
committing themselves

00:08:24.154 --> 00:08:27.400
to trying to make that story a reality.

00:08:27.928 --> 00:08:30.666
And Verne's story was not
the only one in the 19th century

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.360
with a long arm of influence.

00:08:32.384 --> 00:08:34.054
On the other side of the Atlantic,

00:08:34.078 --> 00:08:36.804
H.G. Wells's "War of the Worlds"
directly inspired

00:08:36.828 --> 00:08:39.815
a young man in Massachusetts,
Robert Goddard.

00:08:40.356 --> 00:08:42.478
And it was after reading
"War of the Worlds"

00:08:42.502 --> 00:08:44.070
that Goddard wrote in his diary,

00:08:44.094 --> 00:08:46.092
one day in the late 1890s,

00:08:46.116 --> 00:08:49.874
of resting while trimming
a cherry tree on his family's farm

00:08:49.898 --> 00:08:55.053
and having a vision of a spacecraft
taking off from the valley below

00:08:55.077 --> 00:08:56.953
and ascending into the heavens.

00:08:56.977 --> 00:09:00.934
And he decided then and there
that he would commit the rest of his life

00:09:00.958 --> 00:09:04.439
to the development of the spacecraft
that he saw in his mind's eye.

00:09:05.266 --> 00:09:06.701
And he did exactly that.

00:09:07.238 --> 00:09:09.627
Throughout his career,
he would celebrate that day

00:09:09.651 --> 00:09:12.042
as his anniversary day,
his cherry tree day,

00:09:12.066 --> 00:09:15.679
and he would regularly read and reread
the works of Verne and of Wells

00:09:15.703 --> 00:09:19.273
in order to renew his inspiration
and his commitment

00:09:19.297 --> 00:09:23.103
over the decades of labor
and effort that would be required

00:09:23.127 --> 00:09:25.810
to realize the first part of his dream:

00:09:25.834 --> 00:09:27.687
the flight of a liquid fuel rocket,

00:09:27.711 --> 00:09:30.331
which he finally achieved in 1926.

00:09:30.897 --> 00:09:34.758
So it was while reading "From the Earth
to the Moon" and "The War of the Worlds"

00:09:34.782 --> 00:09:38.430
that the first pioneers of astronautics
were inspired to dedicate their lives

00:09:38.454 --> 00:09:40.325
to solving the problems of spaceflight.

00:09:40.349 --> 00:09:43.301
And it was their treatises
and their works in turn

00:09:43.325 --> 00:09:45.441
that inspired the first
technical communities

00:09:45.465 --> 00:09:47.524
and the first projects of spaceflight,

00:09:47.548 --> 00:09:50.210
thus creating a direct chain of influence

00:09:50.234 --> 00:09:52.645
that goes from Godwin to Poe to Verne

00:09:52.669 --> 00:09:54.040
to the Apollo program

00:09:54.064 --> 00:09:56.699
and to the present-day
communities of spaceflight.

00:09:57.689 --> 00:10:00.269
So why I have told you all this?

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.081
Is it just because I think it's cool,

00:10:03.105 --> 00:10:07.118
or because I'm just
weirdly fascinated by stories

00:10:07.142 --> 00:10:09.427
of 17th- and 19th-century science fiction?

00:10:10.538 --> 00:10:12.165
It is, admittedly, partly that.

00:10:14.085 --> 00:10:16.562
But I also think
that these stories remind us

00:10:16.586 --> 00:10:19.472
of the cultural processes
driving spaceflight

00:10:19.496 --> 00:10:21.896
and even technological
innovation more broadly.

00:10:22.582 --> 00:10:24.149
As an economist working at NASA,

00:10:24.173 --> 00:10:26.770
I spend time thinking about
the economic origins

00:10:26.794 --> 00:10:28.777
of our movement out into the cosmos.

00:10:29.349 --> 00:10:34.526
And when you look before the investments
of billionaire tech entrepreneurs

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.258
and before the Cold War Space Race,

00:10:36.282 --> 00:10:39.795
and even before the military investments
in liquid fuel rocketry,

00:10:39.819 --> 00:10:45.280
the economic origins of spaceflight
are found in stories and in ideas.

00:10:46.431 --> 00:10:50.322
It was in these stories that the first
concepts for spaceflight were articulated.

00:10:50.346 --> 00:10:51.897
And it was through these stories

00:10:51.921 --> 00:10:56.371
that the narrative of a future
for humanity in space

00:10:56.395 --> 00:10:58.901
began to propagate from mind to mind,

00:10:58.925 --> 00:11:02.770
eventually creating an intergenerational
intellectual community

00:11:02.794 --> 00:11:05.705
that would iterate
on the ideas for spacecraft

00:11:05.729 --> 00:11:08.098
until such a time
as they could finally be built.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:13.213
This process has now been going on
for over 300 years,

00:11:13.237 --> 00:11:16.773
and the result is
a culture of spaceflight.

00:11:17.614 --> 00:11:19.884
It's a culture that involves
thousands of people

00:11:19.908 --> 00:11:21.961
over hundreds of years.

00:11:21.985 --> 00:11:25.115
Because for hundreds of years,
some of us have looked at the stars

00:11:25.139 --> 00:11:26.331
and longed to go.

00:11:26.355 --> 00:11:28.028
And because for hundreds of years,

00:11:28.052 --> 00:11:29.895
some of us have dedicated our labors

00:11:29.919 --> 00:11:32.396
to the development
of the concepts and systems

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.357
required to make those voyages possible.

00:11:35.857 --> 00:11:38.484
I also wanted to tell you
about Godwin, Poe and Verne

00:11:38.508 --> 00:11:42.152
because I think their stories
also tell us of the importance

00:11:42.176 --> 00:11:45.908
of the stories that we tell each other
about the future more generally.

00:11:45.932 --> 00:11:49.255
Because these stories don't just
transmit information or ideas.

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:51.281
They can also nurture passions,

00:11:52.136 --> 00:11:54.381
passions that can lead us
to dedicate our lives

00:11:54.405 --> 00:11:56.843
to the realization of important projects.

00:11:56.867 --> 00:11:59.351
Which means that these stories can and do

00:11:59.375 --> 00:12:02.229
influence social and technological forces

00:12:02.253 --> 00:12:04.203
centuries into the future.

00:12:05.314 --> 00:12:08.836
I think we need to realize this
and remember it when we tell our stories.

00:12:09.233 --> 00:12:11.085
We need to work hard to write stories

00:12:11.109 --> 00:12:14.165
that don't just show us the possible
dystopian paths we may take

00:12:14.189 --> 00:12:17.348
for a fear that the more dystopian
stories we tell each other,

00:12:17.372 --> 00:12:20.463
the more we plant seeds
for possible dystopian futures.

00:12:21.343 --> 00:12:23.850
Instead we need to tell stories
that plant the seeds,

00:12:23.874 --> 00:12:25.402
if not necessarily for utopias,

00:12:25.426 --> 00:12:29.013
then at least for great new projects
of technological, societal

00:12:29.037 --> 00:12:30.747
and institutional transformation.

00:12:31.428 --> 00:12:34.665
And if we think of this idea
that the stories we tell each other

00:12:34.689 --> 00:12:36.327
can transform the future

00:12:36.351 --> 00:12:38.708
is fanciful or impossible,

00:12:38.732 --> 00:12:41.243
then I think we need to remember
the example of this,

00:12:41.267 --> 00:12:42.920
our voyage to the Moon,

00:12:42.944 --> 00:12:45.201
an idea from the 17th century

00:12:45.225 --> 00:12:49.106
that propagated culturally
for over 300 years

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:50.971
until it could finally be realized.

00:12:51.842 --> 00:12:54.758
So, we need to write new stories,

00:12:55.615 --> 00:12:57.556
stories that, 300 years in the future,

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.457
people will be able
to look back upon and remark

00:13:00.481 --> 00:13:03.906
how they inspired us
to new heights and to new shores,

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:07.289
how they showed us new paths
and new possibilities,

00:13:07.313 --> 00:13:09.537
and how they shaped
our world for the better.

00:13:09.561 --> 00:13:10.731
Thank you.

00:13:10.755 --> 00:13:14.605
(Applause)
