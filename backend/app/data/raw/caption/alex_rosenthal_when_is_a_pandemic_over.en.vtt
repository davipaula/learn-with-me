00:00:06.488 --> 00:00:10.138
Consider this unfortunately 
familiar scenario.

00:00:10.138 --> 00:00:15.348
Several months ago a highly infectious,
sometimes deadly respiratory virus

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.966
infected humans for the first time.

00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:20.886
It then proliferated faster 
than public health measures

00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:22.526
could contain it.

00:00:22.526 --> 00:00:26.280
Now the World Health Organization (WHO)
has declared a pandemic,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.210
meaning that it’s spreading worldwide.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.210
The death toll is starting to rise 
and everyone is asking the same question:

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.307
when will the pandemic end?

00:00:37.307 --> 00:00:40.457
The WHO will likely declare 
the pandemic over

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:43.117
once the infection is mostly contained

00:00:43.117 --> 00:00:47.432
and rates of transmission drop 
significantly throughout the world.

00:00:47.432 --> 00:00:52.756
But exactly when that happens depends on
what global governments choose to do next.

00:00:52.756 --> 00:00:54.886
They have three main options:

00:00:54.886 --> 00:01:00.071
Race through it, Delay and Vaccinate, 
or Coordinate and Crush.

00:01:00.071 --> 00:01:05.385
One is widely considered best, 
and it may not be the one you think.

00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:09.325
In the first, governments and communities 
do nothing to halt the spread

00:01:09.325 --> 00:01:13.195
and instead allow people to be exposed 
as quickly as possible.

00:01:13.195 --> 00:01:14.965
Without time to study the virus,

00:01:14.965 --> 00:01:17.645
doctors know little about 
how to save their patients,

00:01:17.645 --> 00:01:21.375
and hospitals reach peak capacity 
almost immediately.

00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:26.187
Somewhere in the range of millions 
to hundreds of millions of people die,

00:01:26.187 --> 00:01:30.187
either from the virus 
or the collapse of health care systems.

00:01:30.187 --> 00:01:32.900
Soon the majority of people 
have been infected

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.100
and either perished or survived
by building up their immune responses.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.240
Around this point herd immunity kicks in,

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.440
where the virus can no longer
find new hosts.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.993
So the pandemic fizzles out 
a short time after it began.

00:01:48.993 --> 00:01:51.616
But there’s another way to create 
herd immunity

00:01:51.616 --> 00:01:54.146
without such a high cost of life.

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:59.132
Let’s reset the clock to the moment 
the WHO declared the pandemic.

00:01:59.132 --> 00:02:02.252
This time, governments and communities
around the world

00:02:02.252 --> 00:02:06.252
slow the spread of the virus 
to give research facilities time

00:02:06.252 --> 00:02:08.152
to produce a vaccine.

00:02:08.152 --> 00:02:12.891
They buy this crucial time through tactics
that may include widespread testing

00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:14.481
to identify carriers,

00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:18.061
quarantining the infected 
and people they’ve interacted with,

00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:21.051
and physical distancing.

00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:25.051
Even with these measures in place, 
the virus slowly spreads,

00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:28.291
causing up to hundreds of thousands 
of deaths.

00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:32.736
Some cities get the outbreak under control
and go back to business as usual,

00:02:32.736 --> 00:02:34.406
only to have a resurgence

00:02:34.406 --> 00:02:38.406
and return to physical distancing 
when a new case passes through.

00:02:38.406 --> 00:02:40.479
Within the next several years,

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:46.093
one or possibly several vaccines become 
widely, and hopefully freely, available

00:02:46.093 --> 00:02:48.623
thanks to a worldwide effort.

00:02:48.623 --> 00:02:52.179
Once 40-90% of the population 
has received it—

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:55.119
the precise amount varying 
based on the virus—

00:02:55.119 --> 00:03:00.359
herd immunity kicks in, 
and the pandemic fizzles out.

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:04.810
Let’s rewind the clock one more time, 
to consider the final strategy:

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.900
Coordinate and Crush.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.470
The idea here is to simultaneously starve
the virus, everywhere,

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.579
through a combination of quarantine, 
social distancing, and restricting travel.

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.029
The critical factor 
is to synchronize responses.

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:23.019
In a typical pandemic, 
when one country is peaking,

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.009
another may be getting its first cases.

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:30.437
Instead of every leader responding 
to what’s happening in their jurisdiction,

00:03:30.437 --> 00:03:36.031
here everyone must treat the world 
as the giant interconnected system it is.

00:03:36.031 --> 00:03:41.108
If coordinated properly, this could end 
a pandemic in just a few months,

00:03:41.108 --> 00:03:43.658
with low loss of life.

00:03:43.658 --> 00:03:48.267
But unless the virus is completely 
eradicated— which is highly unlikely—

00:03:48.267 --> 00:03:52.839
there will be risks of it escalating 
to pandemic levels once again.

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:56.839
And factors like animals carrying 
and transmitting the virus

00:03:56.839 --> 00:04:00.699
might undermine 
our best efforts altogether.

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:05.908
So which strategy is best for this deadly,
infectious respiratory virus?

00:04:05.908 --> 00:04:10.105
Racing through it is a quick fix, 
but would be a global catastrophe,

00:04:10.105 --> 00:04:13.905
and may not work at all 
if people can be reinfected.

00:04:13.905 --> 00:04:19.222
Crushing the virus through Coordination 
alone is also enticing for its speed,

00:04:19.222 --> 00:04:24.443
but only reliable with true 
and nearly impossible global cooperation.

00:04:24.443 --> 00:04:30.060
That’s why vaccination, assisted by 
as much global coordination as possible,

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.690
is generally considered to be the winner;

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.027
it’s the slow, steady, 
and proven option in the race.

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:41.505
Even if the pandemic officially ends 
before a vaccine is ready,

00:04:41.505 --> 00:04:47.436
the virus may reappear seasonally, so 
vaccines will continue to protect people.

00:04:47.436 --> 00:04:50.106
And although it may take years to create,

00:04:50.106 --> 00:04:55.481
disruptions to most people’s lives 
won’t necessarily last the full duration.

00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:58.021
Breakthroughs in treatment 
and prevention of symptoms

00:04:58.021 --> 00:05:00.821
can make viruses much less dangerous,

00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:04.821
and therefore require less extreme 
containment measures.

00:05:04.821 --> 00:05:07.961
Take heart: the pandemic will end.

00:05:07.961 --> 00:05:11.481
Its legacy will be long-lasting,
but not all bad;

00:05:11.481 --> 00:05:15.051
the breakthroughs, social services, 
and systems we develop

00:05:15.051 --> 00:05:17.921
can be used to the betterment of everyone.

00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:20.377
And if we take inspiration 
from the successes

00:05:20.377 --> 00:05:22.627
and lessons from the failures,

00:05:22.627 --> 00:05:26.207
we can keep the next potential 
pandemic so contained

00:05:26.207 --> 00:05:29.957
that our children’s children 
won’t even know its name.
