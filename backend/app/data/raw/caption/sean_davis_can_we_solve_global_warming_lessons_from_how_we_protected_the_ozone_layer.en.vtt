00:00:13.101 --> 00:00:16.317
So, I'm a climate scientist,

00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:21.719
and if this room is representative
of the country we live in,

00:00:21.743 --> 00:00:26.234
that means about 60 percent of you,
so maybe from about there over,

00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:30.763
don't strongly trust me for information
on the causes of climate change.

00:00:32.312 --> 00:00:34.375
Now, I promise to tell the truth tonight,

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.281
but just to humor that demographic,

00:00:37.305 --> 00:00:39.543
I've started this talk with a falsehood.

00:00:39.567 --> 00:00:42.321
[The Paris Climate Accord
is a product of the recognition

00:00:42.345 --> 00:00:44.369
that climate change
is a global problem ...]

00:00:44.383 --> 00:00:46.574
This statement was not made
by President Obama.

00:00:46.598 --> 00:00:48.161
It was made by President Reagan,

00:00:48.185 --> 00:00:51.371
and it wasn't about climate change
and the Paris Climate Accord.

00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:53.614
It was actually
about the Montreal Protocol

00:00:53.638 --> 00:00:55.717
and stratospheric ozone depletion.

00:00:57.512 --> 00:01:01.733
Now, I'm sure that many of you aren't
familiar with this environmental problem,

00:01:01.757 --> 00:01:03.098
but you should be,

00:01:03.122 --> 00:01:06.792
because it's a rare
environmental success story.

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:08.733
And it's worth revisiting,

00:01:08.757 --> 00:01:12.289
because sometimes, we need
to examine the world we've avoided

00:01:12.313 --> 00:01:15.749
in order to find guidance
for the choices we make today.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.456
So let's go back to the 1970s,

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.290
when some questionable choices were made:

00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:27.147
first of all -- hoo --
hairstyles. (Laughs)

00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:31.295
Second of all, objectively
terrible quantities of hairspray,

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:36.388
and third, CFCs, chlorofluorocarbons,

00:01:36.412 --> 00:01:40.739
man-made chemicals that were used
as propellant in aerosol spray cans.

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:44.813
And see, it turns out
these CFCs were a problem

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:47.682
because they were destroying
the ozone layer.

00:01:47.706 --> 00:01:50.302
Now I'm sure most of you
have heard of the ozone layer,

00:01:50.326 --> 00:01:51.768
but why does it matter?

00:01:51.792 --> 00:01:56.402
Well, quite simply,
the ozone layer is earth's sunscreen,

00:01:56.426 --> 00:01:57.850
and it's really fragile.

00:01:58.955 --> 00:02:00.654
If you could take all of the ozone,

00:02:00.678 --> 00:02:03.840
which is mostly about
10 to 20 miles up above our heads,

00:02:03.864 --> 00:02:06.766
and compress it down
to the surface of the earth,

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.239
it would form a thin shell
only about two pennies thick,

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:12.332
about an eighth of an inch.

00:02:12.356 --> 00:02:15.787
And that thin shell does
an amazing amount of work, though.

00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:21.072
It filters out more than 90 percent
of the harmful UV radiation

00:02:21.096 --> 00:02:22.246
coming from the sun.

00:02:23.162 --> 00:02:28.519
And while I'm sure many of you
enjoy that suntan that you get

00:02:28.543 --> 00:02:32.344
from the remaining 10 percent,
it causes a lot of problems:

00:02:32.368 --> 00:02:33.518
cataracts,

00:02:34.754 --> 00:02:36.306
damage to crops,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.253
damage to immune systems

00:02:38.627 --> 00:02:39.881
and also skin cancer.

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:42.223
It's not an exaggeration

00:02:42.247 --> 00:02:45.795
to say that a threat to the ozone layer
is a threat to human safety.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.367
And actually, ironically,
it was human safety

00:02:50.391 --> 00:02:53.667
that motivated the invention
of CFCs in the first place.

00:02:53.691 --> 00:02:55.858
You see, in the early days
of refrigeration,

00:02:55.882 --> 00:02:59.524
refrigerators used toxic
and flammable chemicals

00:02:59.548 --> 00:03:00.992
like propane and ammonia.

00:03:01.905 --> 00:03:03.966
For good reason,
the refrigeration industry

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.536
wanted a safe alternative,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.802
and they found that in 1928,

00:03:07.826 --> 00:03:10.080
when a scientist named Thomas Midgley

00:03:10.104 --> 00:03:13.151
synthesized the first
commercially viable CFCs.

00:03:14.143 --> 00:03:20.224
And in fact, Midgley famously
inhaled CFCs and blew out a candle

00:03:20.248 --> 00:03:22.868
to demonstrate,
at a scientific conference,

00:03:22.892 --> 00:03:25.312
that they were safe and nonflammable.

00:03:25.336 --> 00:03:28.098
And in fact, as a scientist,
I can tell you there is no way

00:03:28.122 --> 00:03:30.416
you could get away
with that kind of antic today.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.630
I mean, wow.

00:03:33.084 --> 00:03:34.950
But really, at the time,

00:03:34.974 --> 00:03:38.925
CFCs were a really remarkable invention.

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:42.172
They allowed what we now know
as modern-day refrigeration

00:03:42.196 --> 00:03:44.006
and air-conditioning and other things.

00:03:44.677 --> 00:03:50.391
So it wasn't actually until
over 40 years later, in the 1970s,

00:03:50.415 --> 00:03:55.113
when scientists realized that CFCs
would break down high in the atmosphere

00:03:55.137 --> 00:03:57.443
and damage the ozone layer.

00:03:57.467 --> 00:04:00.117
And this finding really set off
a lot of public concern.

00:04:00.141 --> 00:04:05.289
It led, ultimately, to the banning
of CFC usage in aerosol spray cans

00:04:05.313 --> 00:04:08.561
in the US and a few
other countries in 1978.

00:04:09.788 --> 00:04:11.383
Now, the story doesn't end there,

00:04:11.407 --> 00:04:14.430
because CFCs were used
in much more than just spray cans.

00:04:15.684 --> 00:04:19.890
In 1985, scientists discovered
the Antarctic ozone hole,

00:04:20.905 --> 00:04:23.879
and this was a truly alarming discovery.

00:04:23.903 --> 00:04:26.333
Scientists did not expect this at all.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.794
Before the Antarctic ozone hole,

00:04:29.818 --> 00:04:33.595
scientists expected
maybe a five or 10 percent reduction

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:35.651
in ozone over a century.

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:40.176
But what they found
over the course of less than a decade

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.587
was that more than a third of the ozone
had simply vanished,

00:04:44.611 --> 00:04:47.066
over an area larger
than the size of the US.

00:04:48.645 --> 00:04:52.683
And although we now know that CFCs
are the root cause of this ozone hole,

00:04:52.707 --> 00:04:55.061
at the time, the science
was far from settled.

00:04:56.105 --> 00:04:59.117
Yet despite this uncertainty,

00:04:59.141 --> 00:05:01.648
the crisis helped spur nations to act.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.353
So that quote that I started
this talk with,

00:05:06.377 --> 00:05:09.333
about the Montreal Protocol,
from President Reagan --

00:05:09.357 --> 00:05:13.184
that was his signing statement
when he signed the Montreal Protocol

00:05:13.208 --> 00:05:17.006
after its unanimous ratification
by the US Senate.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.547
And this is something
that's truly worth celebrating.

00:05:19.571 --> 00:05:24.453
In fact, yesterday was the 30th
anniversary of the Montreal Protocol.

00:05:24.477 --> 00:05:30.737
(Applause)

00:05:30.761 --> 00:05:32.503
Because of the protocol,

00:05:32.527 --> 00:05:36.884
ozone-depleting substances
are now declining in our atmosphere,

00:05:36.908 --> 00:05:40.403
and we're starting to see the first signs
of healing in the ozone layer.

00:05:41.118 --> 00:05:45.118
And furthermore, because many
of those ozone-depleting substances

00:05:45.142 --> 00:05:47.860
are also very potent greenhouse gases,

00:05:47.884 --> 00:05:50.662
the Montreal Protocol
has actually delayed global warming

00:05:50.686 --> 00:05:51.971
by more than a decade.

00:05:52.628 --> 00:05:53.895
That's just wonderful.

00:05:54.728 --> 00:05:59.201
But I think it's worth
asking the question,

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:02.827
as we face our current
environmental crisis, global warming,

00:06:02.851 --> 00:06:05.226
what lessons can we learn from Montreal?

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.589
Are there any? I think there are.

00:06:08.765 --> 00:06:13.082
First, we don't need
absolute certainty to act.

00:06:13.742 --> 00:06:15.454
When Montreal was signed,

00:06:15.478 --> 00:06:19.519
we were less certain then
of the risks from CFCs

00:06:19.543 --> 00:06:23.995
than we are now of the risks
from greenhouse gas emissions.

00:06:25.116 --> 00:06:28.894
A common tactic that people
who oppose climate action use

00:06:28.918 --> 00:06:32.981
is to completely ignore risk
and focus only on uncertainty.

00:06:33.648 --> 00:06:35.209
But so what about uncertainty?

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:39.516
We make decisions in the face
of uncertainty all the time,

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.494
literally all the time.

00:06:41.518 --> 00:06:45.958
You know, I'll bet those of you
who drove here tonight,

00:06:45.982 --> 00:06:47.839
you probably wore your seat belt.

00:06:48.807 --> 00:06:50.015
And so ask yourself,

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:52.628
did you wear your seat belt
because someone told you

00:06:52.652 --> 00:06:54.559
with a hundred percent [certainty]

00:06:54.583 --> 00:06:56.991
that you would get
in a car crash on the way here?

00:06:57.711 --> 00:06:59.135
Probably not.

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:01.477
So that's the first lesson.

00:07:01.501 --> 00:07:04.762
Risk management and decision making
always have uncertainty.

00:07:05.494 --> 00:07:09.254
Ignoring risk and focusing
only on uncertainty is a distraction.

00:07:10.372 --> 00:07:14.189
In other words, inaction is an action.

00:07:16.767 --> 00:07:21.727
Second, it takes a village
to raise a healthy environment.

00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:26.908
The Montreal Protocol wasn't just
put together by industry and governments

00:07:26.932 --> 00:07:30.903
or environmental advocacy
groups and scientists.

00:07:30.927 --> 00:07:32.639
It was put together by all of them.

00:07:32.663 --> 00:07:35.066
They all had a seat at the table,

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.015
and they all played
an important role in the solution.

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:39.390
And I think in this regard,

00:07:39.414 --> 00:07:41.796
we're actually seeing
some encouraging signs today.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:46.410
We see not just environmental groups
concerned about climate change

00:07:46.434 --> 00:07:49.024
but also civic and religious groups,

00:07:49.048 --> 00:07:51.381
the military and businesses.

00:07:52.744 --> 00:07:55.567
So wherever you find yourself
on that spectrum,

00:07:55.591 --> 00:07:57.295
we need you at the table,

00:07:57.319 --> 00:07:59.511
because if we're going
to solve global warming,

00:07:59.535 --> 00:08:01.595
it's going to take actions at all levels,

00:08:01.619 --> 00:08:04.313
from the individual to the international

00:08:04.337 --> 00:08:06.042
and everything in between.

00:08:08.621 --> 00:08:09.771
Third lesson:

00:08:10.673 --> 00:08:13.244
don't let the perfect
be the enemy of the good.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:19.650
While Montreal has become the brake pedal
for stopping ozone depletion,

00:08:19.674 --> 00:08:23.253
at its beginning, it was more
just like a tap on the brakes.

00:08:24.524 --> 00:08:27.854
It was actually the later
amendments to the protocol

00:08:27.878 --> 00:08:31.783
that really marked the decision
to hit the brakes on ozone depletion.

00:08:33.061 --> 00:08:34.443
So to those who despair

00:08:34.467 --> 00:08:37.800
that the Paris Climate Accord
didn't go far enough

00:08:37.824 --> 00:08:42.780
or that your limited actions on their own
won't solve global warming,

00:08:42.804 --> 00:08:46.335
I say don't let the perfect
be the enemy of the good.

00:08:48.439 --> 00:08:53.272
And finally, I think it helps us
to contemplate the world we've avoided.

00:08:54.742 --> 00:09:00.510
Indeed, the world we have avoided
by enacting the Montreal Protocol

00:09:00.534 --> 00:09:02.720
is one of catastrophic changes

00:09:02.744 --> 00:09:04.894
to our environment
and to human well-being.

00:09:05.846 --> 00:09:12.086
By the 2030s, we'll be avoiding millions
of new skin cancer cases per year

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.160
with a number that would only grow.

00:09:15.549 --> 00:09:19.955
If I'm lucky, I'll live long enough
to see the end of this animation

00:09:19.979 --> 00:09:23.176
and to see the ozone hole
restored to its natural state.

00:09:24.573 --> 00:09:27.902
So as we write the story
for earth's climate future

00:09:27.926 --> 00:09:29.410
for this century and beyond,

00:09:29.434 --> 00:09:32.895
we need to ask ourselves,
what will our actions be

00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:35.261
so that someone can stand on this stage

00:09:35.285 --> 00:09:39.745
in 30 or 50 or a hundred years

00:09:39.769 --> 00:09:42.109
to celebrate the world
that they've avoided.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.371
Thank you.

00:09:44.395 --> 00:09:48.865
(Applause)
