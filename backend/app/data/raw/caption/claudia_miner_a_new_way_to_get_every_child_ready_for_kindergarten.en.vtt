00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:14.167
I'm an historian.

00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:18.208
And what I love about being an historian
is it gives you perspective.

00:00:18.687 --> 00:00:23.206
Today, I'd like to bring that perspective
to education in the United States.

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:26.493
About the only thing people can agree on

00:00:26.517 --> 00:00:30.374
is that the most strategic time
for a child to start learning

00:00:30.398 --> 00:00:31.871
is early.

00:00:31.895 --> 00:00:33.270
Over 50 years ago,

00:00:33.294 --> 00:00:36.784
there was a watershed moment
in early education in the US

00:00:36.808 --> 00:00:38.120
called "Head Start."

00:00:38.588 --> 00:00:40.668
Now, historians love watersheds

00:00:40.692 --> 00:00:43.899
because it makes it so easy
to talk about what came before

00:00:43.923 --> 00:00:45.648
and what's happened since.

00:00:45.672 --> 00:00:48.291
Before Head Start, basically nothing.

00:00:48.863 --> 00:00:50.258
With Head Start,

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:55.495
we began to get our nation's
most at-risk children ready for school.

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.461
Since Head Start, we've made strides,

00:00:58.485 --> 00:01:02.268
but there are still
2.2 million children in the US

00:01:02.292 --> 00:01:04.632
without access to early learning,

00:01:04.656 --> 00:01:07.844
or more than half of
the four-year-olds in the country.

00:01:08.613 --> 00:01:10.255
That's a problem.

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:13.759
But the bigger problem is what we know
happens to those children.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.650
At-risk children who reach school
without basic skills

00:01:17.674 --> 00:01:20.714
are 25 percent more likely to drop out,

00:01:20.738 --> 00:01:23.447
40 percent more likely
to become teen parents

00:01:23.471 --> 00:01:26.616
and 60 percent less likely
to go to college.

00:01:27.278 --> 00:01:30.187
So if we know how important
early education is,

00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:32.391
why aren't all children getting it?

00:01:33.074 --> 00:01:36.913
There are barriers that the solutions
we've come up with to date

00:01:36.937 --> 00:01:38.806
simply can't overcome.

00:01:39.338 --> 00:01:42.098
Geography: think rural and remote.

00:01:42.122 --> 00:01:46.020
Transportation: think
working parents everywhere.

00:01:46.044 --> 00:01:50.820
Parent choice: no state requires
a four-year-old to go to school.

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:55.940
And cost: the average cost for a state
to educate a preschooler

00:01:55.964 --> 00:01:58.275
is five thousand dollars a year.

00:01:59.674 --> 00:02:02.663
So am I just going
to keep talking about problems?

00:02:02.687 --> 00:02:03.855
No.

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:08.946
Today, I want to tell you about
a cost-effective, technology-delivered,

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.152
kindergarten-readiness program
that can be done in the home.

00:02:13.176 --> 00:02:14.532
It's called UPSTART,

00:02:14.556 --> 00:02:19.047
and more than 60,000 preschoolers
in the US have already used it.

00:02:19.678 --> 00:02:21.635
Now, I know what you might be thinking:

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.590
here's another person throwing tech
at a national problem.

00:02:26.102 --> 00:02:27.749
And you'd be partially right.

00:02:28.102 --> 00:02:33.026
We develop early learning software
designed to individualize instruction,

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.962
so children can learn at their own pace.

00:02:35.986 --> 00:02:41.304
To do that, we rely on experts from fields
ranging from reading to sociology

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:45.245
to brain science development
to all aspects of early learning,

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.772
to tell us what the software
should do and look like.

00:02:48.796 --> 00:02:50.084
Here's an example.

00:02:50.108 --> 00:02:52.854
(Video) Zero (sings
to the tune of "Day-O"): Zero!

00:02:52.878 --> 00:02:55.389
Zero!

00:02:56.245 --> 00:03:00.529
Zero is the number
that's different from the others.

00:03:00.553 --> 00:03:03.633
Seagulls: Zero is a big, round "O."

00:03:03.657 --> 00:03:07.965
Zero: It's not like one,
I'm sure you'll discover.

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.376
Seagulls: Zero is a big, round "O."

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.477
(Laughter)

00:03:12.501 --> 00:03:15.356
Claudia Miner: That is "The Zero Song."

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.075
(Laughter)

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.556
And here are Odd Todd and Even Steven
to teach you some things about numbers.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.926
And here are the Word Birds,

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.359
and they're going to show you
when you blend letter sounds together,

00:03:27.383 --> 00:03:28.890
you can form words.

00:03:29.287 --> 00:03:33.254
You can see that instruction
is short, colorful and catchy,

00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:35.931
designed to capture a child's attention.

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:39.125
But there's another piece to UPSTART

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:41.892
that makes it different
and more effective.

00:03:41.916 --> 00:03:46.216
UPSTART puts parents in charge
of their children's education.

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:49.179
We believe, with the right support,

00:03:49.203 --> 00:03:54.224
all parents can get their children
ready for school.

00:03:55.052 --> 00:03:57.009
Here's how it works.

00:03:57.033 --> 00:04:00.163
This is the kindergarten readiness
checklist from a state.

00:04:00.187 --> 00:04:02.463
And almost every state has one.

00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:05.122
We go to parents wherever they are,

00:04:05.146 --> 00:04:08.060
and we conduct a key
in-person group training.

00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:14.189
And we tell them the software can check
every reading, math and science box,

00:04:14.213 --> 00:04:18.398
but they're going to be responsible
for motor skills and self-help skills,

00:04:18.422 --> 00:04:21.598
and together, we're going to work
on social emotional learning.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.132
Now, we know this is working

00:04:24.156 --> 00:04:27.916
because we have a 90-percent
completion rate for the program.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.294
Last year, that translated
into 13,500 children

00:04:32.318 --> 00:04:36.752
"graduating," with diplomas, from UPSTART.

00:04:37.792 --> 00:04:40.258
And the results have been amazing.

00:04:40.282 --> 00:04:42.095
We have an external evaluation

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:48.486
that shows our children
have two to three times the learning gains

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.568
as children who don't
participate in the program.

00:04:51.592 --> 00:04:55.970
We have a random control trial that shows
strong evidence of effectiveness,

00:04:55.994 --> 00:04:58.148
and we even have a longitudinal study

00:04:58.172 --> 00:05:01.799
that shows our children's gains
last into third and fourth grade,

00:05:01.823 --> 00:05:04.691
the highest grades the children
had achieved at the time.

00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:07.017
Those are academic gains.

00:05:07.041 --> 00:05:11.494
But another study has shown
that our children's social emotional gains

00:05:11.518 --> 00:05:15.251
are equal to those of children
attending public and private preschool.

00:05:16.561 --> 00:05:21.095
The majority of the 60,000 children
who have participated in UPSTART to date

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:22.881
have been from Utah.

00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:24.791
But we have replicated our results

00:05:24.815 --> 00:05:27.644
with African-American
children in Mississippi --

00:05:27.668 --> 00:05:30.255
this is Kingston and his mother;

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:32.922
with English language
learners in Arizona --

00:05:32.946 --> 00:05:35.318
this is Daisy and her family;

00:05:35.342 --> 00:05:41.050
with refugee children in Philadelphia --
this is my favorite graduation photo;

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:43.378
and with Native American children

00:05:43.402 --> 00:05:46.966
from some of the most remote
parts of the United States.

00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:51.498
This is Cherise, and this is
where she lives in Monument Valley.

00:05:52.972 --> 00:05:55.958
Now, there are skeptics about UPSTART.

00:05:55.982 --> 00:05:59.704
Some people don't believe young children
should have screen time.

00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:03.057
To them, we say:

00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:07.460
UPSTART's usage requirement
of 15 minutes a day, five days a week,

00:06:07.484 --> 00:06:12.744
is well within the hour-a-day recommended
by the American Academy of Pediatrics

00:06:12.768 --> 00:06:13.970
for four-year-olds.

00:06:14.501 --> 00:06:18.910
Some people believe
only site-based preschool can work,

00:06:18.934 --> 00:06:22.845
and to them, we say:
site-based preschool is great,

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:27.873
but if you can't get a child there
or if a parent won't send a child there,

00:06:27.897 --> 00:06:33.996
isn't a technology-delivered,
results-based option a great alternative?

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.048
And we love working
with site-based preschools.

00:06:37.072 --> 00:06:40.048
Right now, there are
800 children in Mississippi

00:06:40.072 --> 00:06:42.342
going to Head Start during the day

00:06:42.366 --> 00:06:45.579
and doing UPSTART at night
with their families.

00:06:47.362 --> 00:06:51.508
Our audacious idea is to take UPSTART
across the country --

00:06:52.247 --> 00:06:55.454
not to replace anything;

00:06:55.478 --> 00:07:00.760
we want to serve children who otherwise
would not have access to early education.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.418
We have the guts to take on the skeptics,

00:07:04.442 --> 00:07:06.357
we have the energy to do the work,

00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:07.916
and we have a plan.

00:07:08.524 --> 00:07:12.415
It is the role of the states
to educate their children.

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:15.079
So first we will use philanthropy dollars

00:07:15.103 --> 00:07:18.888
to go into a state to pilot
the program and get data.

00:07:19.451 --> 00:07:22.077
Every state believes it's unique

00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:26.125
and wants to know that the program
will work with its children

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:27.344
before investing.

00:07:27.874 --> 00:07:32.731
Then we identify key leaders in the state
to help us champion UPSTART

00:07:32.755 --> 00:07:35.734
as an option for unserved children.

00:07:35.758 --> 00:07:39.189
And together, we go to state legislatures

00:07:39.213 --> 00:07:41.693
to transition UPSTART from philanthropy

00:07:41.717 --> 00:07:44.837
to sustainable and scalable state funding.

00:07:45.483 --> 00:07:47.066
That plan has worked --

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.312
(Applause)

00:07:49.336 --> 00:07:53.333
Thanks.

00:07:53.357 --> 00:07:54.542
Thank you.

00:07:54.566 --> 00:07:58.174
That plan has worked
in three states to date:

00:07:58.198 --> 00:08:01.038
Utah, Indiana and South Carolina.

00:08:01.062 --> 00:08:04.115
We've also piloted the program
in a number of states

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:06.292
and identified champions.

00:08:06.316 --> 00:08:10.085
Next, we're moving to states
with the greatest geographic barriers

00:08:10.109 --> 00:08:11.550
to work the plan,

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:14.932
and then on to states
that already have early education

00:08:14.956 --> 00:08:17.728
but may not be getting
great academic results

00:08:17.752 --> 00:08:20.606
or great parent buy-in to participate.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:22.388
From there, we go to the states

00:08:22.412 --> 00:08:27.550
that are going to require the most data
and work to convince,

00:08:27.574 --> 00:08:31.017
and we'll hope our momentum
helps turn the tide there.

00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:34.124
We will serve a quarter of a million
children in five years,

00:08:34.148 --> 00:08:39.029
and we will ensure that states continue
to offer UPSTART to their children.

00:08:40.351 --> 00:08:41.996
Here's how you can help:

00:08:42.574 --> 00:08:43.905
for two thousand dollars,

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:47.810
we can provide a child
with UPSTART, a computer and internet,

00:08:47.834 --> 00:08:50.613
and that child will be part of the pilot

00:08:50.637 --> 00:08:53.980
that makes certain other children
get UPSTART in the future.

00:08:54.521 --> 00:08:57.502
We also need engaged citizens
to go to their government

00:08:57.526 --> 00:09:03.324
and say just how easy it can be
to get children ready for school.

00:09:03.667 --> 00:09:06.919
You wouldn't be here
if you weren't an engaged citizen,

00:09:06.943 --> 00:09:08.869
so we're asking for your help.

00:09:10.496 --> 00:09:16.124
Now, will all of us this make UPSTART
a watershed moment in early education?

00:09:16.654 --> 00:09:19.313
I believe together we can make it one.

00:09:19.781 --> 00:09:21.775
But I can tell you without a doubt

00:09:21.799 --> 00:09:23.954
that UPSTART is a watershed moment

00:09:23.978 --> 00:09:28.308
in the life of a child who otherwise
would not be ready for school.

00:09:28.332 --> 00:09:29.498
Thank you.

00:09:29.522 --> 00:09:33.634
(Applause)
