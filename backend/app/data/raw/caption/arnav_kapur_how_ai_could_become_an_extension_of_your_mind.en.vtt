00:00:13.917 --> 00:00:15.684
Ever since computers were invented,

00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:19.309
we've been trying to make them
smarter and more powerful.

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:22.101
From the abacus, to room-sized machines,

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:24.976
to desktops, to computers in our pockets.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.434
And are now designing
artificial intelligence to automate tasks

00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:30.292
that would require human intelligence.

00:00:31.542 --> 00:00:33.476
If you look at the history of computing,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.726
we've always treated computers
as external devices

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.083
that compute and act on our behalf.

00:00:40.167 --> 00:00:46.059
What I want to do is I want to weave
computing, AI and internet as part of us.

00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:48.643
As part of human cognition,

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:50.917
freeing us to interact
with the world around us.

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:54.476
Integrate human and machine intelligence

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.333
right inside our own bodies to augment us,
instead of diminishing us or replacing us.

00:01:00.583 --> 00:01:04.768
Could we combine what people do best,
such as creative and intuitive thinking,

00:01:04.792 --> 00:01:06.184
with what computers do best,

00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:09.976
such as processing information
and perfectly memorizing stuff?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.833
Could this whole be better
than the sum of its parts?

00:01:14.167 --> 00:01:16.976
We have a device
that could make that possible.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.643
It's called AlterEgo,
and it's a wearable device

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:22.684
that gives you the experience
of a conversational AI

00:01:22.708 --> 00:01:24.309
that lives inside your head,

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:27.917
that you could talk to in likeness
to talking to yourself internally.

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:31.518
We have a new prototype
that we're showing here,

00:01:31.542 --> 00:01:34.542
for the first time at TED,
and here's how it works.

00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:37.559
Normally, when we speak,

00:01:37.583 --> 00:01:40.393
the brain sends neurosignals
through the nerves

00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:42.559
to your internal speech systems,

00:01:42.583 --> 00:01:46.042
to activate them and your vocal cords
to produce speech.

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.393
One of the most complex
cognitive and motor tasks

00:01:49.417 --> 00:01:50.875
that we do as human beings.

00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:54.184
Now, imagine talking to yourself

00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:56.809
without vocalizing,
without moving your mouth,

00:01:56.833 --> 00:01:58.434
without moving your jaw,

00:01:58.458 --> 00:02:01.125
but by simply articulating
those words internally.

00:02:02.208 --> 00:02:06.976
Thereby very subtly engaging
your internal speech systems,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.625
such as your tongue
and back of your palate.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.768
When that happens,

00:02:12.792 --> 00:02:17.184
the brain sends extremely weak signals
to these internal speech systems.

00:02:17.208 --> 00:02:18.934
AlterEgo has sensors,

00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:23.184
embedded in a thin plastic,
flexible and transparent device

00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:25.417
that sits on your neck
just like a sticker.

00:02:27.542 --> 00:02:30.184
These sensors pick up
on these internal signals

00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:32.101
sourced deep within the mouth cavity,

00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:33.833
right from the surface of the skin.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.768
An AI program running in the background

00:02:37.792 --> 00:02:41.101
then tries to figure out
what the user's trying to say.

00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:44.518
It then feeds back an answer to the user

00:02:44.542 --> 00:02:46.309
by means of bone conduction,

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:49.976
audio conducted through the skull
into the user's inner ear,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.268
that the user hears,

00:02:51.292 --> 00:02:54.393
overlaid on top of the user's
natural hearing of the environment,

00:02:54.417 --> 00:02:55.667
without blocking it.

00:02:58.542 --> 00:03:02.351
The combination of all these parts,
the input, the output and the AI,

00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:06.184
gives a net subjective experience
of an interface inside your head

00:03:06.208 --> 00:03:09.333
that you could talk to
in likeness to talking to yourself.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.726
Just to be very clear, the device
does not record or read your thoughts.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.684
It records deliberate information
that you want to communicate

00:03:18.708 --> 00:03:21.768
through deliberate engagement
of your internal speech systems.

00:03:21.792 --> 00:03:24.518
People don't want to be read,
they want to write.

00:03:24.542 --> 00:03:26.476
Which is why we designed the system

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.208
to deliberately record
from the peripheral nervous system.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.250
Which is why the control
in all situations resides with the user.

00:03:37.042 --> 00:03:39.792
I want to stop here for a second
and show you a live demo.

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:43.684
What I'm going to do is,
I'm going to ask Eric a question.

00:03:43.708 --> 00:03:45.809
And he's going to search
for that information

00:03:45.833 --> 00:03:49.726
without vocalizing, without typing,
without moving his fingers,

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.018
without moving his mouth.

00:03:51.042 --> 00:03:53.934
Simply by internally asking that question.

00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:57.143
The AI will then figure out the answer
and feed it back to Eric,

00:03:57.167 --> 00:03:58.792
through audio, through the device.

00:03:59.917 --> 00:04:03.018
While you see a laptop
in front of him, he's not using it.

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:05.393
Everything lives on the device.

00:04:05.417 --> 00:04:09.208
All he needs is that sticker device
to interface with the AI and the internet.

00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:15.417
So, Eric, what's the weather
in Vancouver like, right now?

00:04:22.917 --> 00:04:24.601
What you see on the screen

00:04:24.625 --> 00:04:29.142
are the words that Eric
is speaking to himself right now.

00:04:29.166 --> 00:04:30.666
This is happening in real time.

00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:35.268
Eric: It's 50 degrees
and rainy here in Vancouver.

00:04:35.292 --> 00:04:38.018
Arnav Kapur: What happened is
that the AI sent the answer

00:04:38.042 --> 00:04:40.292
through audio, through
the device, back to Eric.

00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:43.667
What could the implications
of something like this be?

00:04:44.542 --> 00:04:47.893
Imagine perfectly memorizing things,

00:04:47.917 --> 00:04:50.870
where you perfectly record information
that you silently speak,

00:04:50.894 --> 00:04:52.934
and then hear them later when you want to,

00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.351
internally searching for information,

00:04:55.375 --> 00:04:57.976
crunching numbers at speeds computers do,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.917
silently texting other people.

00:05:00.917 --> 00:05:03.226
Suddenly becoming multilingual,

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.518
so that you internally
speak in one language,

00:05:05.542 --> 00:05:08.208
and hear the translation
in your head in another.

00:05:09.125 --> 00:05:11.250
The potential could be far-reaching.

00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:14.809
There are millions of people
around the world

00:05:14.833 --> 00:05:17.309
who struggle with using natural speech.

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:20.643
People with conditions such as ALS,
or Lou Gehrig's disease,

00:05:20.667 --> 00:05:22.351
stroke and oral cancer,

00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:24.083
amongst many other conditions.

00:05:25.917 --> 00:05:29.542
For them, communicating is
a painstakingly slow and tiring process.

00:05:30.667 --> 00:05:32.268
This is Doug.

00:05:32.292 --> 00:05:34.601
Doug was diagnosed with ALS
about 12 years ago

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:36.542
and has since lost the ability to speak.

00:05:37.292 --> 00:05:39.268
Today, he uses an on-screen keyboard

00:05:39.292 --> 00:05:42.643
where he types in individual letters
using his head movements.

00:05:42.667 --> 00:05:45.583
And it takes several minutes
to communicate a single sentence.

00:05:46.583 --> 00:05:48.434
So we went to Doug and asked him

00:05:48.458 --> 00:05:52.792
what were the first words
he'd like to use or say, using our system.

00:05:54.292 --> 00:05:57.143
Perhaps a greeting, like,
"Hello, how are you?"

00:05:57.167 --> 00:05:59.375
Or indicate that he needed
help with something.

00:06:01.125 --> 00:06:03.559
What Doug said that he wanted
to use our system for

00:06:03.583 --> 00:06:07.226
is to reboot the old system he had,
because that old system kept on crashing.

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.000
(Laughter)

00:06:10.083 --> 00:06:11.792
We never could have predicted that.

00:06:12.917 --> 00:06:16.667
I'm going to show you a short clip of Doug
using our system for the first time.

00:06:22.417 --> 00:06:24.042
(Voice) Reboot computer.

00:06:26.375 --> 00:06:27.684
AK: What you just saw there

00:06:27.708 --> 00:06:31.309
was Doug communicating or speaking
in real time for the first time

00:06:31.333 --> 00:06:33.167
since he lost the ability to speak.

00:06:34.125 --> 00:06:35.684
There are millions of people

00:06:35.708 --> 00:06:39.101
who might be able to communicate
in real time like Doug,

00:06:39.125 --> 00:06:42.125
with other people, with their friends
and with their families.

00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:46.583
My hope is to be able to help them
express their thoughts and ideas.

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:51.101
I believe computing, AI and the internet

00:06:51.125 --> 00:06:54.851
would disappear into us
as extensions of our cognition,

00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:58.476
instead of being external
entities or adversaries,

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.809
amplifying human ingenuity,

00:07:00.833 --> 00:07:04.708
giving us unimaginable abilities
and unlocking our true potential.

00:07:05.833 --> 00:07:09.667
And perhaps even freeing us
to becoming better at being human.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.768
Thank you so much.

00:07:11.792 --> 00:07:17.559
(Applause)

00:07:17.583 --> 00:07:18.958
Shoham Arad: Come over here.

00:07:23.083 --> 00:07:24.333
OK.

00:07:25.917 --> 00:07:29.434
I want to ask you a couple of questions,
they're going to clear the stage.

00:07:29.458 --> 00:07:32.976
I feel like this is amazing,
it's innovative,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.476
it's creepy, it's terrifying.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.559
Can you tell us what I think ...

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:41.309
I think there are some
uncomfortable feelings around this.

00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:43.643
Tell us, is this reading your thoughts,

00:07:43.667 --> 00:07:44.934
will it in five years,

00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:47.875
is there a weaponized version of this,
what does it look like?

00:07:48.833 --> 00:07:52.101
AK: So our first design principle,
before we started working on this,

00:07:52.125 --> 00:07:55.643
was to not render ethics
as an afterthought.

00:07:55.667 --> 00:07:59.101
So we wanted to bake ethics
right into the design.

00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:00.393
We flipped the design.

00:08:00.417 --> 00:08:02.476
Instead of reading
from the brain directly,

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.726
we're reading from
the voluntary nervous system

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.941
that you deliberately have to engage
to communicate with the device,

00:08:07.965 --> 00:08:11.169
while still bringing the benefits
of a thinking or a thought device.

00:08:11.183 --> 00:08:12.809
The best of both worlds in a way.

00:08:12.833 --> 00:08:16.434
SA: OK, I think people are going to have
a lot more questions for you.

00:08:16.458 --> 00:08:18.143
Also, you said that it's a sticker.

00:08:18.167 --> 00:08:20.143
So right now it sits just right here?

00:08:20.167 --> 00:08:21.851
Is that the final iteration,

00:08:21.875 --> 00:08:25.208
what the final design you hope looks like?

00:08:26.167 --> 00:08:30.893
AK: Our goal is for the technology
to disappear completely.

00:08:30.917 --> 00:08:32.184
SA: What does that mean?

00:08:32.208 --> 00:08:34.851
AK: If you're wearing it,
I shouldn't be able to see it.

00:08:34.875 --> 00:08:38.226
You don't want technology on your face,
you want it in the background,

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.893
to augment you in the background.

00:08:39.917 --> 00:08:42.518
So we have a sticker version
that conforms to the skin,

00:08:42.542 --> 00:08:43.809
that looks like the skin,

00:08:43.833 --> 00:08:46.101
but we're trying to make
an even smaller version

00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:47.417
that would sit right here.

00:08:49.167 --> 00:08:50.433
SA: OK.

00:08:50.457 --> 00:08:53.433
I feel like if anyone has any questions
they want to ask Arnav,

00:08:53.457 --> 00:08:54.726
he'll be here all week.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.183
OK, thank you so much, Arnav.

00:08:56.207 --> 00:08:57.583
AK: Thanks, Shoham.
