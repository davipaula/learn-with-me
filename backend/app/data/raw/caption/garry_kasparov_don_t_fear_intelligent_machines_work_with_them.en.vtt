00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.936
This story begins in 1985,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.936
when at age 22,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.336
I became the World Chess Champion

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.560
after beating Anatoly Karpov.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.736
Earlier that year,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.376
I played what is called
simultaneous exhibition

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.696
against 32 of the world's
best chess-playing machines

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.080
in Hamburg, Germany.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.360
I won all the games,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.736
and then it was not considered
much of a surprise

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.800
that I could beat 32 computers
at the same time.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.056
To me, that was the golden age.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.176
(Laughter)

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.720
Machines were weak,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.016
and my hair was strong.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.240
(Laughter)

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.776
Just 12 years later,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.416
I was fighting for my life
against just one computer

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.640
in a match

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.416
called by the cover of "Newsweek"

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.216
"The Brain's Last Stand."

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.456
No pressure.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.000
(Laughter)

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.616
From mythology to science fiction,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.376
human versus machine

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.160
has been often portrayed
as a matter of life and death.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.536
John Henry,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.256
called the steel-driving man

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.056
in the 19th century
African American folk legend,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.456
was pitted in a race

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.216
against a steam-powered hammer

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.600
bashing a tunnel through mountain rock.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.000
John Henry's legend
is a part of a long historical narrative

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.760
pitting humanity versus technology.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.080
And this competitive rhetoric
is standard now.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.520
We are in a race against the machines,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.440
in a fight or even in a war.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.496
Jobs are being killed off.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.080
People are being replaced
as if they had vanished from the Earth.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.736
It's enough to think that the movies
like "The Terminator" or "The Matrix"

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.960
are nonfiction.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.960
There are very few instances of an arena

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.616
where the human body and mind
can compete on equal terms

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:23.480
with a computer or a robot.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.138
Actually, I wish there were a few more.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.960
Instead,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.496
it was my blessing and my curse

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.216
to literally become the proverbial man

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.336
in the man versus machine competition

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.240
that everybody is still talking about.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.136
In the most famous human-machine
competition since John Henry,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.736
I played two matches

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.200
against the IBM supercomputer, Deep Blue.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.216
Nobody remembers
that I won the first match --

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.576
(Laughter)

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.000
(Applause)

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.896
In Philadelphia, before losing the rematch
the following year in New York.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.680
But I guess that's fair.

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.416
There is no day in history,
special calendar entry

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.936
for all the people
who failed to climb Mt. Everest

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.696
before Sir Edmund Hillary
and Tenzing Norgay

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.920
made it to the top.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.720
And in 1997, I was still
the world champion

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.720
when chess computers finally came of age.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.496
I was Mt. Everest,

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.120
and Deep Blue reached the summit.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.656
I should say of course,
not that Deep Blue did it,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.816
but its human creators --

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.176
Anantharaman, Campbell, Hoane, Hsu.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.400
Hats off to them.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.256
As always, machine's triumph
was a human triumph,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.040
something we tend to forget when humans
are surpassed by our own creations.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.800
Deep Blue was victorious,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.600
but was it intelligent?

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.120
No, no it wasn't,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.256
at least not in the way Alan Turing
and other founders of computer science

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.480
had hoped.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.016
It turned out that chess
could be crunched by brute force,

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.296
once hardware got fast enough

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.280
and algorithms got smart enough.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.456
Although by the definition of the output,

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.696
grandmaster-level chess,

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.000
Deep Blue was intelligent.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.720
But even at the incredible speed,

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.760
200 million positions per second,

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.560
Deep Blue's method

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.960
provided little of the dreamed-of insight
into the mysteries of human intelligence.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.776
Soon,

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.376
machines will be taxi drivers

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.816
and doctors and professors,

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.440
but will they be "intelligent?"

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.336
I would rather leave these definitions

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.920
to the philosophers and to the dictionary.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.320
What really matters is how we humans

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.920
feel about living and working
with these machines.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.416
When I first met Deep Blue
in 1996 in February,

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.040
I had been the world champion
for more than 10 years,

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.096
and I had played 182
world championship games

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.216
and hundreds of games against
other top players in other competitions.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.296
I knew what to expect from my opponents

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.000
and what to expect from myself.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.856
I was used to measure their moves

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.496
and to gauge their emotional state

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.360
by watching their body language
and looking into their eyes.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.880
And then I sat across
the chessboard from Deep Blue.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.816
I immediately sensed something new,

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.160
something unsettling.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.240
You might experience a similar feeling

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.856
the first time you ride
in a driverless car

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.720
or the first time your new computer
manager issues an order at work.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.920
But when I sat at that first game,

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.216
I couldn't be sure

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.920
what is this thing capable of.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.080
Technology can advance in leaps,
and IBM had invested heavily.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.880
I lost that game.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.096
And I couldn't help wondering,

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.680
might it be invincible?

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.960
Was my beloved game of chess over?

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.936
These were human doubts, human fears,

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.640
and the only thing I knew for sure

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.296
was that my opponent Deep Blue
had no such worries at all.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.080
(Laughter)

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.320
I fought back

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.080
after this devastating blow

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.200
to win the first match,

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.600
but the writing was on the wall.

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.536
I eventually lost to the machine

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.616
but I didn't suffer the fate of John Henry

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.680
who won but died
with his hammer in his hand.

00:07:44.718 --> 00:07:47.560
[John Henry Died with a Hammer in His Hand
Palmer C. Hayden]

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.880
[The Museum of African
American Art, Los Angeles]

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.256
It turned out that the world of chess

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.520
still wanted to have
a human chess champion.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.600
And even today,

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.536
when a free chess app
on the latest mobile phone

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.576
is stronger than Deep Blue,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.080
people are still playing chess,

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.920
even more than ever before.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.016
Doomsayers predicted
that nobody would touch the game

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.296
that could be conquered by the machine,

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.536
and they were wrong, proven wrong,

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.016
but doomsaying has always been
a popular pastime

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.400
when it comes to technology.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.096
What I learned from my own experience

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:33.776
is that we must face our fears

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.520
if we want to get the most
out of our technology,

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.736
and we must conquer those fears

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:46.000
if we want to get the best
out of our humanity.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.895
While licking my wounds,

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:51.880
I got a lot of inspiration

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.775
from my battles against Deep Blue.

00:08:55.799 --> 00:08:58.920
As the old Russian saying goes,
if you can't beat them, join them.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.256
Then I thought,

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.616
what if I could play with a computer --

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.800
together with a computer at my side,
combining our strengths,

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.936
human intuition
plus machine's calculation,

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.656
human strategy, machine tactics,

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.096
human experience, machine's memory.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.320
Could it be the perfect game ever played?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.680
My idea came to life

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.296
in 1998 under the name of Advanced Chess

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:34.000
when I played this human-plus-machine
competition against another elite player.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.176
But in this first experiment,

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:43.560
we both failed to combine
human and machine skills effectively.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.160
Advanced Chess found
its home on the internet,

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:55.016
and in 2005, a so-called
freestyle chess tournament

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.400
produced a revelation.

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.776
A team of grandmasters
and top machines participated,

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.536
but the winners were not grandmasters,

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.920
not a supercomputer.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.016
The winners were a pair
of amateur American chess players

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.200
operating three ordinary PCs
at the same time.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.576
Their skill of coaching their machines

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:26.376
effectively counteracted
the superior chess knowledge

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.976
of their grandmaster opponents

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.160
and much greater
computational power of others.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.560
And I reached this formulation.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.936
A weak human player plus a machine

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.216
plus a better process is superior

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.656
to a very powerful machine alone,

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.576
but more remarkably,
is superior to a strong human player

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.560
plus machine

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.520
and an inferior process.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.480
This convinced me that we would need

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.680
better interfaces
to help us coach our machines

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.240
towards more useful intelligence.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.616
Human plus machine isn't the future,

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.856
it's the present.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.016
Everybody that's used online translation

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.336
to get the gist of a news article
from a foreign newspaper,

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.000
knowing its far from perfect.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.776
Then we use our human experience

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.896
to make sense out of that,

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.696
and then the machine
learns from our corrections.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.680
This model is spreading and investing
in medical diagnosis, security analysis.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:40.560
The machine crunches data,

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.056
calculates probabilities,

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.736
gets 80 percent of the way, 90 percent,

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.136
making it easier for analysis

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.760
and decision-making of the human party.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.120
But you are not going to send your kids

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.560
to school in a self-driving car
with 90 percent accuracy,

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.200
even with 99 percent.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.416
So we need a leap forward

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:16.600
to add a few more crucial decimal places.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.200
Twenty years after
my match with Deep Blue,

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.816
second match,

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:32.136
this sensational
"The Brain's Last Stand" headline

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.736
has become commonplace

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.296
as intelligent machines

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.520
move

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.760
in every sector, seemingly every day.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.256
But unlike in the past,

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.920
when machines replaced

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.856
farm animals, manual labor,

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.376
now they are coming
after people with college degrees

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.680
and political influence.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.216
And as someone
who fought machines and lost,

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.880
I am here to tell you
this is excellent, excellent news.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.216
Eventually, every profession

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.336
will have to feel these pressures

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:12.960
or else it will mean humanity
has ceased to make progress.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:15.960
We don't

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.160
get to choose

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.200
when and where
technological progress stops.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.520
We cannot

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.456
slow down.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.296
In fact,

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.240
we have to speed up.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.240
Our technology excels at removing

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.560
difficulties and uncertainties
from our lives,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.816
and so we must seek out

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.696
ever more difficult,

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.800
ever more uncertain challenges.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.400
Machines have

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.696
calculations.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.296
We have understanding.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.360
Machines have instructions.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.696
We have purpose.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.000
Machines have

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.296
objectivity.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.520
We have passion.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:26.576
We should not worry
about what our machines can do today.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:31.176
Instead, we should worry
about what they still cannot do today,

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:36.696
because we will need the help
of the new, intelligent machines

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.800
to turn our grandest dreams into reality.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.320
And if we fail,

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.896
if we fail, it's not because our machines
are too intelligent,

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.320
or not intelligent enough.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.280
If we fail, it's because
we grew complacent

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.240
and limited our ambitions.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.560
Our humanity is not defined by any skill,

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.960
like swinging a hammer
or even playing chess.

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:09.576
There's one thing only a human can do.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.800
That's dream.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.656
So let us dream big.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.896
Thank you.

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.807
(Applause)
