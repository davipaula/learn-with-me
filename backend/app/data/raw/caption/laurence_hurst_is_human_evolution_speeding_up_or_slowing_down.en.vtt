00:00:06.957 --> 00:00:13.088
The Tibetan high plateau lies 
about 4500 meters above sea level,

00:00:13.088 --> 00:00:17.058
with only 60% of the oxygen found below.

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:21.390
While visitors and recent settlers 
struggle with altitude sickness,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.749
native Tibetans sprint up mountains.

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:27.860
This ability comes not from training 
or practice,

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.590
but from changes to a few genes 
that allow their bodies

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.720
to make the most of limited oxygen.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.660
These differences are apparent from birth—

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.510
Tibetan babies have, on average, 
higher birth weights,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.690
higher oxygen saturation,

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.400
and are much likelier to survive than 
other babies born in this environment.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.840
These genetic changes are estimated 
to have evolved

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.167
over the last 3,000 years or so, 
and are ongoing.

00:00:57.167 --> 00:00:59.364
That may sound like a long time,

00:00:59.364 --> 00:01:05.737
but would be the fastest an adaptation 
has ever evolved in a human population.

00:01:05.737 --> 00:01:08.857
It’s clear that human evolution
isn’t over—

00:01:08.857 --> 00:01:10.937
so what are other recent changes?

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:16.562
And will our technological and scientific
innovations impact our evolution?

00:01:16.562 --> 00:01:18.462
In the past few thousand years,

00:01:18.462 --> 00:01:23.345
many populations have evolved genetic 
adaptations to their local environments.

00:01:23.345 --> 00:01:29.943
People in Siberia and the high arctic are 
uniquely adapted to survive extreme cold.

00:01:29.943 --> 00:01:32.013
They’re slower to develop frostbite,

00:01:32.013 --> 00:01:36.097
and can continue to use their hands 
in subzero temperatures

00:01:36.097 --> 00:01:38.517
much longer than most people.

00:01:38.517 --> 00:01:41.817
They’ve undergone selection 
for a higher metabolic rate

00:01:41.817 --> 00:01:44.737
that increases heat production.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:50.418
Further south, the Bajau people 
of southeast Asia can dive 70 meters

00:01:50.418 --> 00:01:54.418
and stay underwater 
for almost fifteen minutes.

00:01:54.418 --> 00:01:58.301
Over thousands of years living 
as nomadic hunters at sea,

00:01:58.301 --> 00:02:05.282
they have genetically-hardwired unusually 
large spleens that act as oxygen stores,

00:02:05.282 --> 00:02:08.522
enabling them to stay underwater 
for longer—

00:02:08.522 --> 00:02:13.482
an adaptation similar 
to that of deep diving seals.

00:02:13.482 --> 00:02:16.232
Though it may seem pedestrian 
by comparison,

00:02:16.232 --> 00:02:20.009
the ability to drink milk 
is another such adaptation.

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:23.159
All mammals can drink 
their mother’s milk as babies.

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:28.128
After weaning they switch off the gene 
that allows them to digest milk.

00:02:28.128 --> 00:02:33.374
But communities in sub-Saharan Africa, 
the middle east and northwest Europe

00:02:33.374 --> 00:02:38.324
that used cows for milk have seen 
a rapid increase in DNA variants

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:44.206
that prevent the gene from switching off 
over the last 7 to 8000 years.

00:02:44.206 --> 00:02:48.876
At least in Europe, milk drinking may 
have given people a source of calcium

00:02:48.876 --> 00:02:53.016
to aid in vitamin D production, 
as they moved north and sunlight,

00:02:53.016 --> 00:02:56.769
the usual source of vitamin D, 
decreased.

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.207
Though not always in obvious ways,

00:02:59.207 --> 00:03:04.223
all of these changes improve people’s 
chance of surviving to reproductive age—

00:03:04.223 --> 00:03:06.463
that’s what drives natural selection,

00:03:06.463 --> 00:03:10.007
the force behind all these 
evolutionary changes.

00:03:10.007 --> 00:03:13.507
Modern medicine removes 
many of these selective pressures

00:03:13.507 --> 00:03:16.207
by keeping us alive when our genes,

00:03:16.207 --> 00:03:19.097
sometimes combined 
with infectious diseases,

00:03:19.097 --> 00:03:20.667
would have killed us.

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:25.057
Antibiotics, vaccines, clean water 
and good sanitation

00:03:25.057 --> 00:03:28.893
all make differences between our genes 
less important.

00:03:28.893 --> 00:03:32.424
Similarly, our ability to cure 
childhood cancers,

00:03:32.424 --> 00:03:36.690
surgically extract inflamed appendixes, 
and deliver babies

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.223
whose mothers have life-threatening 
pregnancy-specific conditions,

00:03:41.223 --> 00:03:46.014
all tend to stop selection by allowing 
more people to survive

00:03:46.014 --> 00:03:48.144
to a reproductive age.

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:52.272
But even if every person on Earth 
has access to modern medicine,

00:03:52.272 --> 00:03:55.246
it won’t spell the end of human evolution.

00:03:55.246 --> 00:04:00.192
That’s because there are other aspects 
of evolution besides natural selection.

00:04:00.192 --> 00:04:02.452
Modern medicine makes genetic variation

00:04:02.452 --> 00:04:05.692
that would have been subject 
to natural selection

00:04:05.692 --> 00:04:09.756
subject to what’s called 
genetic drift instead.

00:04:09.756 --> 00:04:14.902
With genetic drift, genetic differences 
vary randomly within a population.

00:04:14.902 --> 00:04:19.970
On a genetic level, modern medicine 
might actually increase variety,

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.270
because harmful mutations don’t kill 
people and thus aren’t eliminated.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.315
This variation doesn’t necessarily 
translate to observable, or phenotypic,

00:04:29.315 --> 00:04:32.605
differences among people, however.

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:36.338
Researchers have also been investigating 
whether genetic adaptations

00:04:36.338 --> 00:04:40.018
to a specific environment 
could appear very quickly

00:04:40.018 --> 00:04:44.408
through epigenetic modification: 
changes not to genes themselves,

00:04:44.408 --> 00:04:48.685
but to whether and when certain genes 
are expressed.

00:04:48.685 --> 00:04:51.409
These changes can happen 
during a lifetime,

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.030
and may even be passed to offspring—

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.780
but so far researchers are conflicted 
over whether epigenetic modifications

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.296
can really persist over many generations

00:05:02.296 --> 00:05:06.550
and lead to lasting changes 
in populations.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.302
There may also be other contributors 
to human evolution.

00:05:10.302 --> 00:05:12.990
Modern medicine and technology 
are very new,

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.420
even compared to the quickest, 
most recent changes by natural selection—

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.307
so only time can tell how our present 
will shape our future.
