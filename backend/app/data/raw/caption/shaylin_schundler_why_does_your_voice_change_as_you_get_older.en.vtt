00:00:07.244 --> 00:00:08.882
In the mid-16th century,

00:00:08.882 --> 00:00:11.674
Italians were captivated by a type 
of male singer

00:00:11.674 --> 00:00:14.136
whose incredible range contained notes

00:00:14.136 --> 00:00:17.192
previously thought impossible 
for adult men.

00:00:17.192 --> 00:00:19.961
However, this gift came at a high price.

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:22.045
To prevent their voices from breaking,

00:00:22.045 --> 00:00:25.097
these singers had been 
castrated before puberty,

00:00:25.097 --> 00:00:28.830
halting the hormonal processes 
that would deepen their voices.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.791
Known as castrati, their light, angelic 
voices were renowned throughout Europe,

00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:39.283
until the cruel procedure that created 
them was outlawed in the 1800s.

00:00:39.283 --> 00:00:43.483
Though stunting vocal growth can produce 
an extraordinary musical range,

00:00:43.483 --> 00:00:48.347
naturally developing voices 
are already capable of incredible variety.

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:54.734
And as we age, our bodies undergo two
major changes which explore that range.

00:00:54.734 --> 00:01:00.529
So how exactly does our voice box work,
and what causes these shifts in speech?

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:05.586
The specific sound of a speaking voice is
the result of many anatomical variables,

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:09.631
but it’s mostly determined by the age 
and health of our vocal cords

00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:12.227
and the size of our larynxes.

00:01:12.227 --> 00:01:16.237
The larynx is a complex system 
of muscle and cartilage

00:01:16.237 --> 00:01:18.865
that supports and moves the vocal cords,

00:01:18.865 --> 00:01:22.814
or, as they’re more accurately known, 
the vocal folds.

00:01:22.814 --> 00:01:25.857
Strung between the thyroid 
and arytenoid cartilages,

00:01:25.857 --> 00:01:31.636
these two muscles form an elastic curtain
that opens and shuts across the trachea,

00:01:31.636 --> 00:01:34.575
the tube that carries 
air through the throat.

00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:36.804
The folds are apart when we’re breathing,

00:01:36.804 --> 00:01:39.136
but when we speak, they slam shut.

00:01:39.136 --> 00:01:42.497
Our lungs push air 
against the closed folds,

00:01:42.497 --> 00:01:46.481
blowing them open and vibrating
the tissue to produce sound.

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:50.279
Unlike the deliberate focus required 
for playing an external instrument,

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:53.561
we effortlessly change notes as we speak.

00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:55.440
By pushing air faster or slower,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.919
we change the frequency and amplitude 
of these vibrations,

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:03.070
which respectively translate to the pitch 
and volume of our voices.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.605
Rapid and small vibrations create 
high-pitched, quiet tones,

00:02:07.605 --> 00:02:12.743
while slow, large vibrations 
produce deep, bellowing rumbles.

00:02:12.743 --> 00:02:16.339
Finally, by moving the laryngeal muscles 
between the cartilages,

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:19.104
we can stretch and contract those folds

00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:22.644
to intuitively play 
our internal instruments.

00:02:22.644 --> 00:02:26.483
This process is the same from 
your first words to your last,

00:02:26.483 --> 00:02:29.466
but as you age, your larynx ages too.

00:02:29.466 --> 00:02:32.776
During puberty, 
the first major shift starts,

00:02:32.776 --> 00:02:35.477
as your voice begins to deepen.

00:02:35.477 --> 00:02:38.656
This happens when 
your larynx grows in size,

00:02:38.656 --> 00:02:43.556
elongating the vocal folds and
opening up more room for them to vibrate.

00:02:43.556 --> 00:02:47.437
These longer folds have slower, 
larger vibrations,

00:02:47.437 --> 00:02:50.649
which result in a lower baseline pitch.

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.307
This growth is especially dramatic
in many males,

00:02:53.307 --> 00:02:57.053
whose high testosterone levels
lead first to voice cracks,

00:02:57.053 --> 00:03:00.167
and then to deeper, more booming voices,

00:03:00.167 --> 00:03:04.258
and laryngeal protrusions 
called Adam’s apples.

00:03:04.258 --> 00:03:06.793
Another vocal development during puberty

00:03:06.793 --> 00:03:09.714
occurs when the homogenous tissue
covering the folds

00:03:09.714 --> 00:03:13.625
specializes into three distinct 
functional layers:

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:15.121
a central muscle,

00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:19.713
a layer of stiff collagen wrapped 
in stretchy elastin fibers,

00:03:19.713 --> 00:03:23.143
and an outer layer of mucus membrane.

00:03:23.143 --> 00:03:25.924
These layers add nuance 
and depth to the voice,

00:03:25.924 --> 00:03:30.763
giving it a distinct timbre that sets it 
apart from its pre-pubescent tones.

00:03:30.763 --> 00:03:35.587
After puberty, most people’s voices remain
more or less the same

00:03:35.587 --> 00:03:37.713
for about 50 years.

00:03:37.713 --> 00:03:39.633
But we all use our voices differently,

00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:44.440
and eventually we experience the
symptoms associated with aging larynxes,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.928
known as presbyphonia.

00:03:45.928 --> 00:03:48.997
First, the collagen in our folds stiffens

00:03:48.997 --> 00:03:52.717
and the surrounding elastin fibers 
atrophy and decay.

00:03:52.717 --> 00:03:57.809
This decreased flexibility increases 
the pitch of older voices.

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:01.220
But for people who have experienced 
the hormonal effects of menopause,

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.634
the higher pitch is countered
and outweighed by swollen vocal folds.

00:04:06.634 --> 00:04:13.324
The folds' increased mass slows their
vibrations, resulting in deeper voices.

00:04:13.324 --> 00:04:15.397
All these symptoms are further complicated

00:04:15.397 --> 00:04:18.735
by having fewer healthy 
laryngeal nerve endings,

00:04:18.735 --> 00:04:23.996
which reduces precise muscle control 
and causes breathy or rough voices.

00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:28.186
Ultimately, these anatomical changes 
are just a few of the factors

00:04:28.186 --> 00:04:30.072
that can affect your voice.

00:04:30.072 --> 00:04:31.791
But when kept in good condition,

00:04:31.791 --> 00:04:34.596
your voice box 
is a finely tuned instrument,

00:04:34.596 --> 00:04:36.669
capable of operatic arias,

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.091
moody monologues,

00:04:38.091 --> 00:04:39.626
and stirring speeches.
