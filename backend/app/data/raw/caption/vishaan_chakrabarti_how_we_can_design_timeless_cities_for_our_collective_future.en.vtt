00:00:13.603 --> 00:00:14.793
Travel with me

00:00:14.817 --> 00:00:18.681
to some of the most beautiful spots
in cities around the world:

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:21.720
Rome's Spanish steps;

00:00:21.744 --> 00:00:26.655
the historic neighborhoods
of Paris and Shanghai;

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:30.530
the rolling landscape of Central Park;

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.134
the tight-knit blocks of Tokyo or Fez;

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:41.487
the wildly sloping streets
of the favelas of Rio de Janeiro;

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.863
the dizzying step wells of Jaipur;

00:00:48.127 --> 00:00:50.895
the arched pedestrian bridges of Venice.

00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:55.498
Now let's go to some newer cities.

00:00:56.093 --> 00:01:00.970
Six downtowns built across
six continents in the 20th century.

00:01:01.763 --> 00:01:06.717
Why do none of these places
have any of the charming characteristics

00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:08.152
of our older cities?

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.098
Or let's go to six suburbs built
on six continents in the 20th century.

00:01:16.054 --> 00:01:21.197
Why do none of them have
any of the lyrical qualities

00:01:21.221 --> 00:01:25.204
that we associate with the places
that we cherish the most?

00:01:27.196 --> 00:01:30.617
Now, maybe you think
I'm just being nostalgic --

00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:31.805
why does it matter?

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.048
Who cares if there is this creeping
sameness besetting our planet?

00:01:37.442 --> 00:01:42.612
Well, it matters because
most people around the world

00:01:42.636 --> 00:01:45.403
are gravitating to urban areas globally.

00:01:46.434 --> 00:01:50.561
And how we design those urban areas
could well determine

00:01:50.585 --> 00:01:53.084
whether we thrive or not as a species.

00:01:53.934 --> 00:02:00.516
So, we already know that people
who live in transit-rich areas,

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.121
live in apartment buildings,

00:02:02.145 --> 00:02:04.957
have a far lower carbon footprint

00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:06.941
than their suburban counterparts.

00:02:07.276 --> 00:02:10.410
So maybe one lesson from that
is if you love nature,

00:02:10.434 --> 00:02:11.683
you shouldn't live in it.

00:02:11.707 --> 00:02:14.121
(Laughter)

00:02:15.157 --> 00:02:17.307
But I think the dry statistics

00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:19.600
of what's known as
transit-oriented development

00:02:19.624 --> 00:02:21.363
only tells part of the story.

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:26.585
Because cities, if they're
going to attract people,

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:27.853
have to be great.

00:02:28.306 --> 00:02:32.617
They have to be powerful magnets
with distinctive appeal

00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:35.061
to bring in all those new green urbanites.

00:02:36.125 --> 00:02:39.299
And this is not just
an aesthetic issue, mind you.

00:02:39.323 --> 00:02:42.608
This is an issue
of international consequence.

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.958
Because today, every day,

00:02:46.982 --> 00:02:53.379
literally hundreds of thousands of people
are moving into a city somewhere,

00:02:53.403 --> 00:02:55.203
mainly in the Global South.

00:02:56.641 --> 00:02:59.664
And when you think
about that, ask yourself:

00:02:59.688 --> 00:03:02.315
Are they condemned to live
in the same bland cities

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:04.387
we built in the 20th century,

00:03:04.411 --> 00:03:06.683
or can we offer them something better?

00:03:07.736 --> 00:03:09.101
And to answer that question,

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:12.409
you have to unpack
how we got here in the first place.

00:03:13.287 --> 00:03:15.365
First: mass production.

00:03:15.857 --> 00:03:19.310
Just like consumer goods and chain stores,

00:03:19.334 --> 00:03:24.887
we mass-produce glass and steel
and concrete and asphalt and drywall,

00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:29.243
and we deploy them in mind-numbingly
similar ways across the planet.

00:03:31.165 --> 00:03:33.466
Second: regulation.

00:03:33.934 --> 00:03:36.196
So, take cars, for instance.

00:03:36.561 --> 00:03:39.204
Cars travel at very high speeds.

00:03:39.228 --> 00:03:41.164
They're susceptible to human error.

00:03:41.188 --> 00:03:44.792
So when we're asked, as architects,
to design a new street,

00:03:44.816 --> 00:03:46.668
we have to look at drawings like this,

00:03:46.692 --> 00:03:48.768
that tell us how high a curb needs to be,

00:03:48.792 --> 00:03:51.926
that pedestrians need to be over here
and vehicles over there,

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.799
a loading zone here, a drop-off there.

00:03:54.823 --> 00:03:57.561
What the car really did
in the 20th century

00:03:57.585 --> 00:04:01.052
is it created this carved-up,
segregated landscape.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.861
Or take the ladder fire truck --
you know, those big ladder trucks

00:04:06.885 --> 00:04:09.582
that are used to rescue people
from burning buildings?

00:04:11.776 --> 00:04:14.085
Those have such a wide turning radius,

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.942
that we have to deploy an enormous amount
of pavement, of asphalt,

00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:20.233
to accommodate them.

00:04:22.633 --> 00:04:25.633
Or take the critically
important wheelchair.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.172
A wheelchair necessitates
a landscape of minimal slopes

00:04:30.196 --> 00:04:31.887
and redundant vertical circulation.

00:04:31.911 --> 00:04:35.148
So wherever there's a stair,
there has to be an elevator or a ramp.

00:04:36.323 --> 00:04:40.697
Now, don't get me wrong, please --
I am all for pedestrian safety,

00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:42.215
firefighting

00:04:42.239 --> 00:04:43.848
and certainly, wheelchair access.

00:04:43.872 --> 00:04:46.943
Both of my parents were in wheelchairs
at the end of their lives,

00:04:46.967 --> 00:04:48.942
so I understand very much that struggle.

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.637
But we also have to acknowledge
that all of these well-intentioned rules,

00:04:54.608 --> 00:04:57.926
they had the tremendous
unintended consequence

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.588
of making illegal the ways
in which we used to build cities.

00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:08.364
Similarly illegal: at the end
of the 19th century,

00:05:08.388 --> 00:05:10.207
right after the elevator was invented,

00:05:10.231 --> 00:05:13.379
we built these charming urban buildings,

00:05:13.403 --> 00:05:15.593
these lovely buildings,
all over the world,

00:05:15.617 --> 00:05:16.990
from Italy to India.

00:05:17.752 --> 00:05:20.537
And they had maybe
10 or 12 apartments in them.

00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:24.243
They had one small elevator
and a staircase that wrapped them

00:05:24.267 --> 00:05:25.417
and a light well.

00:05:25.903 --> 00:05:29.975
And not only were they charming buildings
that were cost-effective,

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:31.196
they were communal --

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.420
you ran into your neighbor
on that stairwell.

00:05:35.053 --> 00:05:36.820
Well, you can't build this, either.

00:05:37.506 --> 00:05:41.688
By contrast, today, when we have to build
a major new apartment building somewhere,

00:05:41.712 --> 00:05:43.942
we have to build
lots and lots of elevators

00:05:43.966 --> 00:05:45.871
and lots of fire stairs,

00:05:45.895 --> 00:05:51.361
and we have to connect them with these
long, anonymous, dreary corridors.

00:05:52.524 --> 00:05:55.944
Now, developers --
when they're confronted with the cost

00:05:55.968 --> 00:05:58.302
of all of that common infrastructure,

00:05:58.326 --> 00:06:01.443
they have to spread that cost
over more apartments,

00:06:01.467 --> 00:06:03.672
so they want to build bigger buildings.

00:06:04.022 --> 00:06:08.387
What that results in is the thud,

00:06:08.411 --> 00:06:13.490
the dull thud of the same
apartment building being built

00:06:13.514 --> 00:06:16.156
in every city across the world.

00:06:17.166 --> 00:06:20.333
And this is not only creating
physical sameness,

00:06:20.357 --> 00:06:22.626
it's creating social sameness,

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.760
because these buildings
are more expensive to build,

00:06:25.784 --> 00:06:28.418
and it helped to create
an affordability crisis

00:06:28.442 --> 00:06:32.573
in cities all over the world,
including places like Vancouver.

00:06:33.688 --> 00:06:36.625
Now, I said there was a third reason
for all this sameness,

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:38.790
and that's really a psychological one.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.863
It's a fear of difference,

00:06:40.887 --> 00:06:43.687
and architects hear this
all the time from their clients:

00:06:43.711 --> 00:06:47.413
"If I try that new idea, will I be sued?

00:06:48.165 --> 00:06:49.418
Will I be mocked?

00:06:50.546 --> 00:06:52.545
Better safe than sorry."

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.974
And all of these things
have conspired together

00:06:56.998 --> 00:07:02.897
to blanket our planet with a homogeneity
that I think is deeply problematic.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.525
So how can we do the opposite?

00:07:05.549 --> 00:07:07.795
How can we go back to building cities

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:11.545
that are physically
and culturally varied again?

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:14.103
How can we build cities of difference?

00:07:14.823 --> 00:07:17.133
I would argue that we should start

00:07:17.157 --> 00:07:20.366
by injecting into the global the local.

00:07:20.814 --> 00:07:23.742
This is already happening
with food, for instance.

00:07:24.076 --> 00:07:29.315
You just look at the way in which
craft beer has taken on corporate beer.

00:07:30.704 --> 00:07:34.101
Or, how many of you
still eat Wonder Bread?

00:07:35.164 --> 00:07:37.172
I'd bet most of you don't.

00:07:37.196 --> 00:07:39.929
And I bet you don't because
you don't want processed food

00:07:39.953 --> 00:07:41.127
in your life.

00:07:41.151 --> 00:07:43.093
So if you don't want processed food,

00:07:43.117 --> 00:07:45.760
why would you want processed cities?

00:07:45.784 --> 00:07:48.903
Why would you want these
mass-produced, bleached places

00:07:48.927 --> 00:07:51.715
where all of us have to live
and work every day?

00:07:53.498 --> 00:07:58.092
(Applause)

00:07:58.806 --> 00:08:03.504
So, technology was a big part
of the problem in the 20th century.

00:08:03.528 --> 00:08:06.077
When we invented the automobile,
what happened is,

00:08:06.101 --> 00:08:08.834
the world all bent towards the invention.

00:08:09.363 --> 00:08:11.751
And we recreated our landscape around it.

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:14.625
In the 21st century,

00:08:14.649 --> 00:08:17.410
technology can be part of the solution --

00:08:17.434 --> 00:08:20.259
if it bends to the needs of the world.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.014
So what do I mean by that?

00:08:23.038 --> 00:08:24.423
Take the autonomous vehicle.

00:08:24.447 --> 00:08:28.193
I don't think the autonomous vehicle
is exciting because it's a driverless car.

00:08:28.217 --> 00:08:29.831
That, to me, only implies

00:08:29.855 --> 00:08:33.251
that there's even more congestion
on the roads, frankly.

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:37.872
I think what's exciting about
the autonomous vehicle is the promise --

00:08:37.896 --> 00:08:39.854
and I want to stress the word "promise,"

00:08:39.878 --> 00:08:41.848
given the recent accident in Arizona --

00:08:42.577 --> 00:08:45.886
the promise that we could have
these small, urban vehicles

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:50.246
that could safely comingle
with pedestrians and bicycles.

00:08:50.776 --> 00:08:54.712
That would enable us
to design humane streets again,

00:08:54.736 --> 00:08:56.348
streets without curbs,

00:08:56.372 --> 00:08:59.497
maybe streets like the wooden
walkways on Fire Island.

00:09:01.078 --> 00:09:06.174
Or maybe we could design streets
with the cobblestone of the 21st century,

00:09:06.198 --> 00:09:09.667
something that captures
kinetic energy, melts snow,

00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:12.103
helps you with your fitness when you walk.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.268
Or remember those big ladder fire trucks?

00:09:16.292 --> 00:09:20.164
What if we could replace them
and all the asphalt that comes with them

00:09:20.188 --> 00:09:24.188
with drones and robots that could
rescue people from burning buildings?

00:09:24.212 --> 00:09:26.998
And if you think that's outlandish,
you'd be amazed to know

00:09:27.022 --> 00:09:30.466
how much of that technology
is already being used today

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:31.757
in rescue activity.

00:09:33.291 --> 00:09:36.370
But now I'd like you
to really imagine with me.

00:09:36.966 --> 00:09:41.154
Imagine if we could design
the hovercraft wheelchair.

00:09:42.299 --> 00:09:43.464
Right?

00:09:43.488 --> 00:09:47.228
An invention that would
not only allow equal access,

00:09:47.252 --> 00:09:52.766
but would enable us to build
the Italian hill town of the 21st century.

00:09:54.244 --> 00:09:56.545
I think you'd be amazed to know

00:09:56.569 --> 00:10:01.356
that just a few of these inventions,
responsive to human need,

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.083
would completely transform
the way we could build our cities.

00:10:06.253 --> 00:10:08.328
Now, I bet you're also thinking:

00:10:08.352 --> 00:10:12.045
"We don't have kinetic cobblestones
or flying wheelchairs yet,

00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:15.466
so what can we do about this problem
with today's technology?"

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:20.712
And my inspiration for that question
comes from a very different city,

00:10:20.736 --> 00:10:23.077
the city of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:24.264
I have clients there

00:10:24.288 --> 00:10:28.942
who have asked us to design
a 21st-century open-air village

00:10:28.966 --> 00:10:33.244
that's sustainably heated
using today's technology,

00:10:33.268 --> 00:10:35.474
in the heart of their downtown.

00:10:35.498 --> 00:10:38.165
And that's to cope
with their frigid winters.

00:10:38.918 --> 00:10:42.180
And the project is both poetry and prose.

00:10:42.204 --> 00:10:46.061
The poetry is really
about evoking the local:

00:10:46.085 --> 00:10:47.888
the mountainous terrain,

00:10:47.912 --> 00:10:51.490
using colors to pick up
the spectacular light,

00:10:51.514 --> 00:10:55.366
understanding how to interpret
the nomadic traditions

00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.964
that animate the nation of Mongolia.

00:10:59.427 --> 00:11:03.180
The prose has been the development
of a catalogue of buildings,

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:06.093
of small buildings
that are fairly affordable,

00:11:06.117 --> 00:11:09.196
using local construction
materials and technology

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.045
that can still provide
new forms of housing,

00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:13.770
new workspace,

00:11:13.794 --> 00:11:14.949
new shops

00:11:14.973 --> 00:11:17.477
and cultural buildings,
like a theater or a museum --

00:11:17.501 --> 00:11:18.755
even a haunted house.

00:11:21.016 --> 00:11:22.814
While working on this in our office,

00:11:22.838 --> 00:11:26.883
we've realized that we're building upon
the work of our colleagues,

00:11:26.907 --> 00:11:31.191
including architect Tatiana Bilbao,
working in Mexico City;

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.450
Pritzker laureate
Alejandro Aravena, working in Chile;

00:11:36.474 --> 00:11:40.189
and recent Pritzker winner
Balkrishna Doshi, working in India.

00:11:40.506 --> 00:11:45.291
And all of them are building spectacular
new forms of affordable housing,

00:11:45.315 --> 00:11:47.815
but they're also building
cities of difference,

00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:51.910
because they're building cities
that respond to local communities,

00:11:51.934 --> 00:11:53.612
local climates

00:11:53.636 --> 00:11:55.569
and local construction methods.

00:11:57.369 --> 00:12:01.334
We're doubling down on that idea,
we're researching a new model

00:12:01.358 --> 00:12:05.160
for our growing cities
with gentrification pressures,

00:12:05.184 --> 00:12:07.910
that could build upon
that late-19th-century model

00:12:07.934 --> 00:12:09.410
with that center core,

00:12:09.434 --> 00:12:15.129
but a prototype that could shape-shift
in response to local needs

00:12:15.153 --> 00:12:17.319
and local building materials.

00:12:18.906 --> 00:12:22.749
All of these ideas,
to me, are nostalgia-free.

00:12:23.276 --> 00:12:25.283
They all tell me

00:12:25.307 --> 00:12:28.252
that we can build cities that can grow,

00:12:28.276 --> 00:12:31.014
but grow in a way that reflects
the diverse residents

00:12:31.038 --> 00:12:32.569
that live in those cities;

00:12:33.395 --> 00:12:38.355
grow in a way that can accommodate
all income groups,

00:12:38.379 --> 00:12:40.546
all colors, creeds, genders.

00:12:42.022 --> 00:12:46.501
We could build such spectacular cities
that we could disincentivize sprawl

00:12:47.304 --> 00:12:49.293
and actually protect nature.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.810
We can grow cities that are high-tech,

00:12:53.834 --> 00:12:58.448
but also respond to the timeless
cultural needs of the human spirit.

00:12:59.778 --> 00:13:03.214
I'm convinced that we can build
cities of difference

00:13:03.238 --> 00:13:07.384
that help to create the global mosaic
to which so many of us aspire.

00:13:07.786 --> 00:13:08.936
Thank you.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.603
(Applause)
