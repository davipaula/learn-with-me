00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.174
So, on the day after the Brexit vote,

00:00:16.198 --> 00:00:19.151
in June 2016,

00:00:19.175 --> 00:00:21.172
when Britain woke up to the shock

00:00:21.196 --> 00:00:24.125
of discovering that we're leaving
the European Union,

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.982
my editor at the "Observer"
newspaper in the UK

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:31.202
asked me to go back to South Wales,
where I grew up, and to write a report.

00:00:32.075 --> 00:00:34.608
And so I went to a town called Ebbw Vale.

00:00:35.178 --> 00:00:36.455
Here it is.

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:40.109
It's in the South Wales Valleys,
which is this quite special place.

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:45.022
So it's had this very, sort of rich,
working-class culture,

00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:49.647
and it's famous for its Welsh
male voice choirs and rugby and its coal.

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:54.653
But when I was a teenager,
the coal mines and the steelworks closed,

00:00:54.677 --> 00:00:57.010
and the entire area was devastated.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.750
And I went there because it had one of
the highest "Leave" votes in the country.

00:01:01.774 --> 00:01:06.290
Sixty-two percent of the people here
voted to leave the European Union.

00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:08.338
And I wanted to know why.

00:01:09.624 --> 00:01:11.846
When I got there,
I was just a bit taken aback,

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.347
because the last time I went to Ebbw Vale,

00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:15.704
it looked like this.

00:01:16.584 --> 00:01:18.831
And now, it looks like this.

00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:24.442
This is a new 33-million-pound
college of further education

00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:27.624
that was mostly funded
by the European Union.

00:01:28.598 --> 00:01:31.669
And this is the new sports center

00:01:31.693 --> 00:01:36.812
that's at the middle of 350-million-pound
regeneration project

00:01:36.836 --> 00:01:40.296
that's being funded by the European Union.

00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:44.630
And this is the new 77-million-pound
road-improvement scheme,

00:01:44.654 --> 00:01:47.122
and there's a new train line,
a new railway station,

00:01:47.146 --> 00:01:49.550
and they're all being funded
by the European Union.

00:01:49.574 --> 00:01:51.588
And it's not as if
any of this is a secret,

00:01:51.612 --> 00:01:53.843
because there's big signs
like this everywhere.

00:01:53.867 --> 00:01:55.324
[EU Funds: Investing in Wales]

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:56.667
(Laughter)

00:01:57.542 --> 00:01:59.800
I had this sort of
weird sense of unreality,

00:01:59.824 --> 00:02:01.630
walking around the town.

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:03.046
And it came to a head

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.870
when I met this young man
in front of the sports center.

00:02:07.482 --> 00:02:11.117
And he told me that he had voted to leave,

00:02:11.141 --> 00:02:15.537
because the European Union
had done nothing for him.

00:02:17.657 --> 00:02:19.123
He was fed up with it.

00:02:19.736 --> 00:02:22.918
And all around town,
people told me the same thing.

00:02:23.895 --> 00:02:26.649
They said that they wanted
to take back control,

00:02:26.673 --> 00:02:29.029
which was one of the slogans
in the campaign.

00:02:29.665 --> 00:02:31.910
And they told me
that they were most fed up

00:02:31.934 --> 00:02:34.220
with the immigrants and with the refugees.

00:02:34.244 --> 00:02:35.444
They'd had enough.

00:02:36.847 --> 00:02:38.268
Which was odd.

00:02:38.292 --> 00:02:41.592
Because walking around,
I didn't meet any immigrants or refugees.

00:02:41.616 --> 00:02:43.292
I met one Polish woman who told me

00:02:43.316 --> 00:02:45.537
she was practically
the only foreigner in town.

00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:47.203
And when I checked the figures,

00:02:47.227 --> 00:02:49.308
I discovered that Ebbw Vale actually has

00:02:49.332 --> 00:02:52.601
one of the lowest rates
of immigration in the country.

00:02:53.395 --> 00:02:54.974
And so I was just a bit baffled,

00:02:54.998 --> 00:02:56.728
because I couldn't really understand

00:02:56.752 --> 00:02:59.069
where people were getting
their information from.

00:02:59.093 --> 00:03:01.347
Because it was the right-wing
tabloid newspapers

00:03:01.371 --> 00:03:03.744
which printed all these stories
about immigration.

00:03:03.768 --> 00:03:06.488
And this is a very much
left-wing Labour stronghold.

00:03:08.006 --> 00:03:11.260
But then after the article came out,
this woman got in touch with me.

00:03:11.585 --> 00:03:13.805
And she was from Ebbw Vale,

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.892
and she told me about all this stuff
that she'd seen on Facebook.

00:03:16.916 --> 00:03:18.122
I was like, "What stuff?"

00:03:18.146 --> 00:03:21.252
And she said it was all this quite scary
stuff about immigration,

00:03:21.276 --> 00:03:22.649
and especially about Turkey.

00:03:22.673 --> 00:03:24.354
So I tried to find it.

00:03:24.378 --> 00:03:26.483
But there was nothing there.

00:03:26.507 --> 00:03:30.380
Because there's no archive
of ads that people had seen

00:03:30.404 --> 00:03:33.054
or what had been pushed
into their news feeds.

00:03:34.491 --> 00:03:37.308
No trace of anything,
gone completely dark.

00:03:38.956 --> 00:03:44.821
And this referendum that will have
this profound effect forever on Britain --

00:03:44.845 --> 00:03:47.163
it's already had a profound effect:

00:03:47.187 --> 00:03:50.403
the Japanese car manufacturers
that came to Wales and the north east

00:03:50.427 --> 00:03:51.861
to replace the mining jobs --

00:03:51.885 --> 00:03:53.853
they are already going because of Brexit.

00:03:54.316 --> 00:03:59.220
And this entire referendum
took place in darkness,

00:03:59.244 --> 00:04:02.275
because it took place on Facebook.

00:04:03.974 --> 00:04:07.981
And what happens on Facebook
stays on Facebook,

00:04:08.005 --> 00:04:11.172
because only you see your news feed,
and then it vanishes,

00:04:11.196 --> 00:04:13.410
so it's impossible to research anything.

00:04:13.434 --> 00:04:16.188
So we have no idea who saw what ads

00:04:16.212 --> 00:04:18.458
or what impact they had,

00:04:18.482 --> 00:04:20.997
or what data was used
to target these people.

00:04:21.323 --> 00:04:24.576
Or even who placed the ads,
or how much money was spent,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.291
or even what nationality they were.

00:04:28.617 --> 00:04:29.817
But Facebook does.

00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:33.664
Facebook has these answers,

00:04:33.688 --> 00:04:36.088
and it's refused to give them to us.

00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:41.577
Our parliament has asked Mark Zuckerberg
multiple times to come to Britain

00:04:41.601 --> 00:04:43.418
and to give us these answers.

00:04:43.442 --> 00:04:45.776
And every single time, he's refused.

00:04:47.244 --> 00:04:49.044
And you have to wonder why.

00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:53.141
Because what I and other
journalists have uncovered

00:04:53.165 --> 00:04:56.807
is that multiple crimes
took place during the referendum.

00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:59.767
And they took place on Facebook.

00:05:00.966 --> 00:05:03.474
It's because in Britain,
we limit the amount of money

00:05:03.498 --> 00:05:05.878
that you can spend in an election.

00:05:05.902 --> 00:05:07.828
And it's because in the 19th century,

00:05:07.852 --> 00:05:11.172
people would walk around
with literally wheelbarrows of cash

00:05:11.196 --> 00:05:12.775
and just buy voters.

00:05:13.617 --> 00:05:17.313
So we passed these strict laws
to stop that from happening.

00:05:18.257 --> 00:05:20.250
But those laws don't work anymore.

00:05:20.663 --> 00:05:24.258
This referendum took place
almost entirely online.

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:28.867
And you can spend any amount of money
on Facebook or on Google or on YouTube ads

00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:31.593
and nobody will know,
because they're black boxes.

00:05:31.617 --> 00:05:33.351
And this is what happened.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.022
We've actually got no idea
of the full extent of it.

00:05:37.046 --> 00:05:40.167
But we do know that in the last days
before the Brexit vote,

00:05:40.191 --> 00:05:42.564
the official "Vote Leave" campaign

00:05:42.588 --> 00:05:46.667
laundered nearly three quarters
of a million pounds

00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:49.768
through another campaign entity

00:05:49.792 --> 00:05:52.847
that our electoral commission
has ruled was illegal,

00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:54.704
and it's referred it to the police.

00:05:55.315 --> 00:05:58.561
And with this illegal cash,

00:05:59.737 --> 00:06:04.825
"Vote Leave" unleashed
a fire hose of disinformation.

00:06:05.503 --> 00:06:06.686
Ads like this.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.471
[Turkey's 76m people joining the EU]

00:06:08.495 --> 00:06:10.129
This is a lie, it's a total lie.

00:06:10.153 --> 00:06:12.535
Turkey is not joining the European Union.

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:17.769
There's not even any discussions
of it joining the European Union.

00:06:17.793 --> 00:06:20.230
And most of us, we never saw these ads,

00:06:20.254 --> 00:06:22.601
because we were not the target of them.

00:06:22.944 --> 00:06:26.625
"Vote Leave" identified
a tiny sliver of people

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:29.498
who it identified as persuadable,
and they saw them.

00:06:29.522 --> 00:06:31.982
And the only reason
we are seeing these now

00:06:32.006 --> 00:06:36.322
is because parliament forced
Facebook to hand them over.

00:06:37.587 --> 00:06:38.761
And maybe you think,

00:06:38.785 --> 00:06:40.746
"Well, it was just a bit of overspending.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:41.920
It's a few lies."

00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:48.428
But this was the biggest electoral fraud
in Britain for 100 years.

00:06:49.405 --> 00:06:52.674
In a once-in-a-generation vote

00:06:52.698 --> 00:06:57.190
that hinged upon just
one percent of the electorate.

00:06:59.075 --> 00:07:02.646
And it was just one of the crimes
that took place in the referendum.

00:07:03.027 --> 00:07:04.570
There was another group,

00:07:04.594 --> 00:07:08.392
which was headed
by this man, Nigel Farage,

00:07:09.522 --> 00:07:11.299
the one to the right of Trump.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.648
And his group, "Leave.EU" --
it also broke the law.

00:07:15.672 --> 00:07:18.942
It broke British electoral laws
and British data laws,

00:07:18.966 --> 00:07:21.699
and it's also being
referred to the police.

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:27.116
And this man, Arron Banks,
he funded this campaign.

00:07:27.696 --> 00:07:30.434
And in a completely separate case,

00:07:30.458 --> 00:07:34.434
he's being referred
to our National Crime Agency,

00:07:34.458 --> 00:07:36.632
our equivalent of the FBI,

00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:38.657
because our electoral commission

00:07:38.681 --> 00:07:41.719
has concluded they don't know
where his money came from.

00:07:41.743 --> 00:07:44.362
Or if it was even British.

00:07:44.712 --> 00:07:49.682
And I'm not even going to go into
the lies that Arron Banks has told

00:07:49.706 --> 00:07:53.299
about his covert relationship
with the Russian government.

00:07:54.545 --> 00:07:58.656
Or the weird timing of Nigel Farage's
meetings with Julian Assange

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.776
and with Trump's buddy,
Roger Stone, now indicted,

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.220
immediately before
two massive WikiLeaks dumps,

00:08:05.244 --> 00:08:07.950
both of which happened
to benefit Donald Trump.

00:08:07.974 --> 00:08:12.749
But I will tell you that Brexit
and Trump were intimately entwined.

00:08:12.773 --> 00:08:17.557
This man told me that Brexit
was the petri dish for Trump.

00:08:18.099 --> 00:08:20.610
And we know it's the same people,
the same companies,

00:08:20.634 --> 00:08:22.316
the same data, the same techniques,

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.164
the same use of hate and fear.

00:08:24.188 --> 00:08:27.121
This is what they
were posting on Facebook.

00:08:27.538 --> 00:08:30.197
And I don't even want to call this a lie,

00:08:30.221 --> 00:08:32.603
[Immigration without assimilation
equals invasion]

00:08:32.627 --> 00:08:35.030
because it feels more
like a hate crime to me.

00:08:38.033 --> 00:08:40.048
I don't have to tell you

00:08:40.072 --> 00:08:46.056
that hate and fear are being sown online
all across the world.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.562
Not just in Britain and America,
but in France and in Hungary

00:08:49.586 --> 00:08:52.212
and Brazil and Myanmar and New Zealand.

00:08:52.751 --> 00:08:57.631
And we know there is this dark undertow
which is connecting us all globally.

00:08:57.973 --> 00:09:01.830
And it is flowing
via the technology platforms.

00:09:02.314 --> 00:09:05.946
But we only see a tiny amount
of what's going on on the surface.

00:09:07.244 --> 00:09:12.101
And I only found out anything
about this dark underbelly

00:09:12.125 --> 00:09:15.039
because I started looking into
Trump's relationship to Farage,

00:09:15.063 --> 00:09:17.712
into a company called Cambridge Analytica.

00:09:18.853 --> 00:09:22.712
And I spent months tracking down
an ex-employee, Christopher Wiley.

00:09:23.777 --> 00:09:28.698
And he told me how this company,
that worked for both Trump and Brexit,

00:09:28.722 --> 00:09:31.640
had profiled people politically

00:09:31.664 --> 00:09:35.791
in order to understand
their individual fears,

00:09:35.815 --> 00:09:39.565
to better target them with Facebook ads.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:44.844
And it did this by illicitly
harvesting the profiles

00:09:44.868 --> 00:09:48.327
of 87 million people from Facebook.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:55.219
It took an entire year's work
to get Christopher on the record.

00:09:55.243 --> 00:09:57.479
And I had to turn myself 
from a feature writer

00:09:57.496 --> 00:10:00.466
into an investigative reporter to do it.

00:10:00.483 --> 00:10:02.078
And he was extraordinarily brave,

00:10:02.102 --> 00:10:05.855
because the company
is owned by Robert Mercer,

00:10:05.879 --> 00:10:07.696
the billionaire who bankrolled Trump,

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.953
and he threatened
to sue us multiple times,

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:12.688
to stop us from publishing.

00:10:13.077 --> 00:10:16.807
But we finally got there,
and we were one day ahead of publication.

00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:18.698
We got another legal threat.

00:10:19.329 --> 00:10:21.203
Not from Cambridge Analytica this time,

00:10:21.227 --> 00:10:22.427
but from Facebook.

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:27.473
It told us that if we publish,
they would sue us.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.010
We did it anyway.

00:10:30.804 --> 00:10:38.510
(Applause)

00:10:40.736 --> 00:10:44.374
Facebook, you were
on the wrong side of history in that.

00:10:44.752 --> 00:10:48.196
And you were on the wrong side
of history in this --

00:10:48.665 --> 00:10:52.204
in refusing to give us
the answers that we need.

00:10:52.696 --> 00:10:54.648
And that is why I am here.

00:10:55.006 --> 00:10:59.690
To address you directly,
the gods of Silicon Valley.

00:10:59.714 --> 00:11:03.958
(Applause)

00:11:03.982 --> 00:11:05.251
Mark Zuckerberg ...

00:11:05.275 --> 00:11:06.902
(Applause)

00:11:06.926 --> 00:11:13.418
and Sheryl Sandberg and Larry Page
and Sergey Brin and Jack Dorsey,

00:11:15.125 --> 00:11:18.058
and your employees
and your investors, too.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.398
Because 100 years ago,

00:11:21.422 --> 00:11:24.199
the biggest danger in the South Wales
coal mines was gas.

00:11:24.223 --> 00:11:26.627
Silent and deadly and invisible.

00:11:26.651 --> 00:11:29.683
It's why they sent the canaries
down first to check the air.

00:11:29.707 --> 00:11:33.796
And in this massive, global, online
experiment that we are all living through,

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.978
we in Britain are the canary.

00:11:36.668 --> 00:11:39.458
We are what happens to a western democracy

00:11:39.482 --> 00:11:43.974
when a hundred years of electoral laws
are disrupted by technology.

00:11:45.117 --> 00:11:48.942
Our democracy is broken,
our laws don't work anymore,

00:11:48.966 --> 00:11:50.664
and it's not me saying this,

00:11:50.688 --> 00:11:53.918
it's our parliament published
a report saying this.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.528
This technology that you have
invented has been amazing.

00:12:00.696 --> 00:12:03.188
But now, it's a crime scene.

00:12:03.927 --> 00:12:06.386
And you have the evidence.

00:12:07.553 --> 00:12:12.164
And it is not enough to say
that you will do better in the future.

00:12:12.973 --> 00:12:17.283
Because to have any hope
of stopping this from happening again,

00:12:17.307 --> 00:12:19.679
we have to know the truth.

00:12:21.362 --> 00:12:24.091
And maybe you think,
"Well, it was just a few ads.

00:12:24.489 --> 00:12:26.869
And people are smarter than that, right?"

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.576
To which I would say,
"Good luck with that."

00:12:32.314 --> 00:12:35.617
Because what the Brexit vote demonstrates

00:12:35.641 --> 00:12:38.323
is that liberal democracy is broken.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:40.600
And you broke it.

00:12:42.282 --> 00:12:44.655
This is not democracy --

00:12:44.679 --> 00:12:50.647
spreading lies in darkness,
paid for with illegal cash,

00:12:50.671 --> 00:12:52.071
from God knows where.

00:12:53.527 --> 00:12:55.654
It's subversion,

00:12:55.678 --> 00:12:57.375
and you are accessories to it.

00:13:00.201 --> 00:13:07.182
(Applause)

00:13:09.845 --> 00:13:13.075
Our parliament has been
the first in the world

00:13:13.099 --> 00:13:15.608
to try to hold you to account,

00:13:15.632 --> 00:13:16.799
and it's failed.

00:13:17.371 --> 00:13:22.220
You are literally beyond the reach
of British law -- not just British laws,

00:13:22.244 --> 00:13:25.498
this is nine parliaments,
nine countries are represented here,

00:13:25.522 --> 00:13:29.283
who Mark Zuckerberg refused
to come and give evidence to.

00:13:30.497 --> 00:13:35.068
And what you don't seem to understand
is that this is bigger than you.

00:13:35.092 --> 00:13:37.139
And it's bigger than any of us.

00:13:37.163 --> 00:13:42.546
And it is not about left or right
or "Leave" or "Remain" or Trump or not.

00:13:43.101 --> 00:13:45.093
It's about whether it's actually possible

00:13:45.117 --> 00:13:47.760
to have a free and fair
election ever again.

00:13:48.497 --> 00:13:51.139
Because as it stands, I don't think it is.

00:13:52.275 --> 00:13:55.758
And so my question to you is,
is this what you want?

00:13:57.172 --> 00:14:00.238
Is this how you want
history to remember you:

00:14:01.223 --> 00:14:05.032
as the handmaidens to authoritarianism

00:14:05.056 --> 00:14:08.873
that is on the rise all across the world?

00:14:10.387 --> 00:14:13.196
Because you set out to connect people.

00:14:13.807 --> 00:14:15.835
And you are refusing to acknowledge

00:14:15.859 --> 00:14:19.317
that the same technology
is now driving us apart.

00:14:21.038 --> 00:14:23.308
And my question to everybody else is,

00:14:23.332 --> 00:14:24.732
is this what we want:

00:14:25.903 --> 00:14:28.545
to let them get away with it,

00:14:28.569 --> 00:14:32.505
and to sit back and play with our phones,
as this darkness falls?

00:14:34.561 --> 00:14:40.474
The history of the South Wales Valleys
is of a fight for rights.

00:14:40.498 --> 00:14:44.713
And this is not a drill --
it's a point of inflection.

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:49.150
Democracy is not guaranteed,
and it is not inevitable,

00:14:49.174 --> 00:14:51.729
and we have to fight and we have to win

00:14:51.753 --> 00:14:55.986
and we cannot let these tech companies
have this unchecked power.

00:14:56.563 --> 00:14:59.333
It's up to us -- you, me and all of us.

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:03.158
We are the ones
who have to take back control.

00:15:04.619 --> 00:15:07.671
(Applause)

00:15:07.695 --> 00:15:10.175
(Cheers)

00:15:10.199 --> 00:15:14.079
(Applause)
