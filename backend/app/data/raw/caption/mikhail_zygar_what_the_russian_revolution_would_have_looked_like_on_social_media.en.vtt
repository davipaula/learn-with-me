00:00:13.093 --> 00:00:14.243
What is history?

00:00:15.438 --> 00:00:17.960
It is something written by the winners.

00:00:20.203 --> 00:00:24.951
There is a stereotype that history
should be focused on the rulers,

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:26.671
like Lenin or Trotsky.

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:30.765
As a result, people
in many countries, like mine, Russia,

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:35.409
look at history as something
that was predetermined

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:37.162
or determined by the leaders,

00:00:38.075 --> 00:00:40.737
and common people could not
influence it in any way.

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:45.165
Many Russians today do not believe
that Russia could ever have been

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:48.002
or ever will be a truly democratic nation,

00:00:48.026 --> 00:00:50.987
and this is due to the way
history has been framed

00:00:51.011 --> 00:00:52.582
to the citizens of Russia.

00:00:52.606 --> 00:00:54.184
And this is not true.

00:00:55.011 --> 00:01:00.772
To prove it, I spent two years
of my life trying to go 100 years back,

00:01:00.796 --> 00:01:03.138
to the year 1917,

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:05.615
the year of the Russian Revolution.

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:11.345
I asked myself, what if the internet
and Facebook existed 100 years ago?

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:17.446
So last year, we built
a social network for dead people,

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.858
named Project1917.com.

00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:24.683
My team and I created our software,

00:01:24.707 --> 00:01:29.987
digitized and uploaded
all possible real diaries and letters

00:01:30.011 --> 00:01:33.113
written by more than 3,000 people

00:01:33.137 --> 00:01:34.669
100 years ago.

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:38.435
So any user of our website or application

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.460
can follow a news feed
for each day of 1917

00:01:42.484 --> 00:01:46.605
and read what people
like Stravinsky or Trotsky,

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:50.176
Lenin or Pavlova
and others thought and felt.

00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:55.636
We watch all those personalities
being ordinary people like you and me,

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.572
not demigods,

00:01:57.596 --> 00:02:04.580
and we see that history consists
of their mistakes, fears, weaknesses,

00:02:04.604 --> 00:02:07.357
not only their "genius ideas."

00:02:08.643 --> 00:02:10.842
Our project was a shock for many Russians,

00:02:10.866 --> 00:02:16.467
who used to think that our country
has always been an autocratic empire

00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:19.904
and the ideas of freedom and democracy
could never have prevailed,

00:02:19.928 --> 00:02:22.578
just because democracy
was not our destiny.

00:02:23.514 --> 00:02:25.442
But if we take a broader look,

00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:27.879
it's not that black and white.

00:02:29.771 --> 00:02:34.474
Yes, 1917 led to 70 years
of communist dictatorship.

00:02:35.584 --> 00:02:40.233
But with this project, we see that Russia
could have had a different history

00:02:40.257 --> 00:02:44.297
and a democratic future,
as any other country could or still can.

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:49.066
Reading the posts from 1917,

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.057
you learn that Russia
was the first country in the world

00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:54.017
to abolish the death penalty,

00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:58.215
or one of the first ones
to grant women voting rights.

00:02:59.334 --> 00:03:05.559
Knowing history and understanding
how ordinary people influenced history

00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:07.441
can help us create a better future,

00:03:07.465 --> 00:03:11.209
because history is just a rehearsal
of what's happening right now.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.413
We do need new ways of telling history,

00:03:15.437 --> 00:03:17.008
and this year, for example,

00:03:17.032 --> 00:03:22.873
we started a new online project
that is called 1968Digital.com,

00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:28.506
and that is an online documentary series

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.474
that gives you an impression
of that year, 1968,

00:03:32.498 --> 00:03:36.037
a year marked by global social change

00:03:36.061 --> 00:03:39.771
that, in many ways,
created the world as we know it now.

00:03:40.327 --> 00:03:43.437
But we are making that history alive

00:03:43.461 --> 00:03:48.000
by imagining what if all the main
characters could use mobile phones ...

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:50.449
just like that?

00:03:51.906 --> 00:03:56.207
And we see that a lot of individuals

00:03:57.477 --> 00:04:02.725
were facing the same challenges
and were fighting for the same values,

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:07.146
no matter if they lived
in the US or in USSR

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.091
or in France or in China
or in Czechoslovakia.

00:04:11.345 --> 00:04:14.187
By exposing history
in such a democratic way,

00:04:14.211 --> 00:04:15.604
through social media,

00:04:16.762 --> 00:04:21.984
we show that people in power
are not the only ones making choices.

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:26.334
That gives any user a possibility
of reclaiming history.

00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:28.445
Ordinary people matter.

00:04:29.096 --> 00:04:30.350
They have an impact.

00:04:31.476 --> 00:04:32.627
Ideas matter.

00:04:33.471 --> 00:04:37.827
Journalists, scientists,
philosophers matter.

00:04:38.542 --> 00:04:39.915
We shape society.

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.523
We all make history.

00:04:43.436 --> 00:04:44.587
Thank you.

00:04:44.611 --> 00:04:48.380
(Applause)
