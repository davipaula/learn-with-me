00:00:06.368 --> 00:00:07.615
What is love?

00:00:07.615 --> 00:00:09.336
Seriously, though, what is it?

00:00:09.336 --> 00:00:10.336
What is love?

00:00:10.336 --> 00:00:11.201
A verb?

00:00:11.201 --> 00:00:11.838
A noun?

00:00:11.838 --> 00:00:13.245
A universal truth?

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:14.614
An ideal?

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:16.781
A common thread of all religions?

00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:17.760
A cult?

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.032
A neurological phenomenon?

00:00:20.032 --> 00:00:21.552
There's no shortage of answers.

00:00:21.552 --> 00:00:23.555
Some are all-encompassing.

00:00:23.555 --> 00:00:24.571
It conquers all.

00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:25.466
It's all you need.

00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:26.772
It's all there is.

00:00:26.772 --> 00:00:28.573
These are all comparisons, though,

00:00:28.573 --> 00:00:30.733
ways of defining it by contrast,

00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.220
by saying it's more important

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.334
than all other things,

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:35.831
but is it?

00:00:35.831 --> 00:00:37.313
Sure, love matters more

00:00:37.313 --> 00:00:39.027
than your standard turkey sandwich,

00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:41.359
but does it matter more than shelter?

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:42.538
Or sanity?

00:00:42.538 --> 00:00:44.564
Or an exceptional turkey sandwich?

00:00:44.564 --> 00:00:45.906
No matter your answer,

00:00:45.906 --> 00:00:47.262
you're just ranking it,

00:00:47.262 --> 00:00:48.805
not defining it.

00:00:48.805 --> 00:00:50.406
Another challenge to defining love

00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:52.080
is we often try to do so

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.355
while falling into it

00:00:53.355 --> 00:00:54.467
or out of it.

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:56.689
Would you trust someone who just won the lottery

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.525
to accurately define the concept of currency?

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:02.852
Or, I don't know, ask a guy to define bears

00:01:02.852 --> 00:01:04.988
while he's fending them off?

00:01:04.988 --> 00:01:08.040
Or is romance not like winning the lottery?

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.415
Are break ups not like bear attacks?

00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:11.589
Bad comparisons?

00:01:11.589 --> 00:01:12.772
That's my point.

00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:13.846
I'm not thinking right

00:01:13.846 --> 00:01:15.308
because I'm in love,

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:16.625
so ha!

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:17.563
Taking a step back,

00:01:17.563 --> 00:01:19.650
or taking a cold shower,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.758
whatever,

00:01:19.758 --> 00:01:22.723
love is potentially the most intensely thought about thing

00:01:22.723 --> 00:01:24.223
in all of human history.

00:01:24.223 --> 00:01:27.086
And despite centuries upon centuries of obsession,

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:28.797
it still overwhelms us.

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:30.605
Some say it's a feeling,

00:01:30.605 --> 00:01:32.105
a magical emotion,

00:01:32.105 --> 00:01:34.957
a feeling for someone like you've never felt before.

00:01:34.957 --> 00:01:36.724
But feelings are fluid,

00:01:36.724 --> 00:01:39.764
not very concrete foundation for a definition.

00:01:39.764 --> 00:01:42.095
Sometimes you hate the person you love.

00:01:42.095 --> 00:01:45.108
Plus, come on, you've felt feelings like it before,

00:01:45.108 --> 00:01:46.736
sort of in miniature.

00:01:46.736 --> 00:01:48.408
Your relationships with your family

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:50.330
shape your relationships with partners.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.695
And your love for your partner

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:53.862
may be in its own dynamic relationship,

00:01:53.862 --> 00:01:55.495
healthy or totally weird,

00:01:55.495 --> 00:01:57.773
with the love of your parents and siblings.

00:01:57.773 --> 00:01:59.430
Love is also a set of behaviors

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.380
we associate with the feeling:

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.521
Holding hands,

00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:03.245
kissing,

00:02:03.245 --> 00:02:04.000
hugging,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.963
public displays of affection,

00:02:05.963 --> 00:02:06.805
dating,

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:07.673
marriage,

00:02:07.673 --> 00:02:08.749
having kids,

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:10.238
or just sex.

00:02:10.238 --> 00:02:12.533
But these loving actions can be subjective

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:14.249
or culturally relative.

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:17.287
You may love or be someone who can't have kids

00:02:17.287 --> 00:02:18.541
or doesn't want to,

00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:20.793
who believes in marriage but also in divorce,

00:02:20.793 --> 00:02:22.968
who's from a culture where people don't really date

00:02:22.968 --> 00:02:24.748
the way we think of dating,

00:02:24.748 --> 00:02:27.365
or who just doesn't want to make out on the bus.

00:02:27.365 --> 00:02:29.581
But if love is a thing that we can define,

00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:31.148
then how can it mean opposite things

00:02:31.148 --> 00:02:32.663
for so many people?

00:02:32.663 --> 00:02:34.386
So, maybe love's just all in your head,

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:36.938
a personal mystery winding through your neural pathways

00:02:36.938 --> 00:02:39.348
and lighting up pleasing, natural rewards

00:02:39.348 --> 00:02:41.062
in your nervous system.

00:02:41.062 --> 00:02:42.958
Perhaps these rewards are addictive.

00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.325
Perhaps love is a temporary

00:02:44.325 --> 00:02:46.854
or permanent addiction to a person,

00:02:46.854 --> 00:02:49.463
just like a person can be addicted to a drug.

00:02:49.463 --> 00:02:50.611
I don't mean to be edgy

00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:51.671
like some pop song.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.663
Evidence shows that chemicals in your brain

00:02:53.663 --> 00:02:55.163
stimulated by another person

00:02:55.163 --> 00:02:57.743
can make you develop a habit for that person.

00:02:57.743 --> 00:02:58.997
The person comes to satisfy

00:02:58.997 --> 00:03:00.625
a physiological craving,

00:03:00.625 --> 00:03:01.916
and you want more.

00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:02.916
But then sometimes,

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:04.331
slowly or suddenly,

00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:05.391
you don't.

00:03:05.391 --> 00:03:06.652
You've fallen out of love,

00:03:06.652 --> 00:03:07.860
become unaddicted,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.914
for a spell.

00:03:08.914 --> 00:03:09.962
What happened?

00:03:09.962 --> 00:03:12.493
Does one develop a tolerance or hit a limit?

00:03:12.493 --> 00:03:14.138
Why do some lovers stay addicted

00:03:14.138 --> 00:03:15.905
to each other their entire lives?

00:03:15.905 --> 00:03:17.464
Perhaps to create new lives,

00:03:17.464 --> 00:03:19.014
to proliferate their species?

00:03:19.014 --> 00:03:21.500
Maybe love is just human DNA's optimal method

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.914
for bringing about its own replication.

00:03:23.914 --> 00:03:25.251
There are evolutionary arguments

00:03:25.251 --> 00:03:27.164
regarding every human mating behavior,

00:03:27.164 --> 00:03:29.569
from how we display ourselves to potential mates,

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.743
to how we treat each other in relationships,

00:03:31.743 --> 00:03:33.363
to how we raise kids.

00:03:33.363 --> 00:03:35.408
Thus, some argue that the feeling

00:03:35.408 --> 00:03:37.419
you think you feel in your soul

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.611
is just biology's way to make you continue our species.

00:03:40.611 --> 00:03:42.040
Nature has selected you

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.866
to have crushes on hotties,

00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:45.075
just like it makes monkeys

00:03:45.075 --> 00:03:46.657
have crushes on hot monkeys,

00:03:46.657 --> 00:03:48.658
and biology marches on.

00:03:48.658 --> 00:03:50.303
But is that all love is?

00:03:50.303 --> 00:03:52.651
Or, perhaps worse, is it just a construct,

00:03:52.651 --> 00:03:55.106
some fake concept we all convince each other

00:03:55.106 --> 00:03:56.250
to try to live up to

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.659
for a fake sense of purpose?

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:58.827
Maybe it is a construct,

00:03:58.827 --> 00:04:00.132
but let's be more precise

00:04:00.132 --> 00:04:01.581
about what a construct is

00:04:01.581 --> 00:04:04.417
because love is constructed from reality:

00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:05.415
Our experiences,

00:04:05.415 --> 00:04:06.082
feelings,

00:04:06.082 --> 00:04:07.206
brain chemistry,

00:04:07.206 --> 00:04:08.335
cultural expectations,

00:04:08.335 --> 00:04:10.180
our lives.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.512
And this edifice can be viewed

00:04:11.512 --> 00:04:12.818
through countless dimensions:

00:04:12.818 --> 00:04:13.728
scientific,

00:04:13.728 --> 00:04:14.424
emotional,

00:04:14.424 --> 00:04:15.326
historical,

00:04:15.326 --> 00:04:16.221
spiritual,

00:04:16.221 --> 00:04:16.992
legal,

00:04:16.992 --> 00:04:18.795
or just personal.

00:04:18.795 --> 00:04:20.914
If no two people are the same,

00:04:20.914 --> 00:04:23.739
no two people's love is the same either.

00:04:23.739 --> 00:04:25.500
So, in every loving relationship,

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.982
there's a lot to talk about

00:04:26.982 --> 00:04:28.873
and partners should be open to that,

00:04:28.873 --> 00:04:31.445
or the relationship probably won't last.

00:04:31.445 --> 00:04:32.835
Love is always up for discussion

00:04:32.835 --> 00:04:35.111
and, sure, under construction.

00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:36.549
So, if we can't define it,

00:04:36.549 --> 00:04:37.715
that's a good sign.

00:04:37.715 --> 00:04:39.639
It means we're all still making it.

00:04:40.408 --> 00:04:41.638
Wait, I didn't mean,

00:04:41.638 --> 00:04:42.882
you know what I meant.
