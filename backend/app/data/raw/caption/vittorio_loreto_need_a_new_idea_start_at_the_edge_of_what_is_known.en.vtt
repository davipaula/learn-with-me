00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.216
We have all probably wondered

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.416
how great minds achieved
what they achieved, right?

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.096
And the more astonishing
their achievements are,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.656
the more we call them geniuses,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.216
perhaps aliens

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.336
coming from a different planet,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.016
definitely not someone like us.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.816
But is that true?

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.640
So let me start with an example.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.256
You all know the story
of Newton's apple, right? OK.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.216
Is that true? Probably not.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.456
Still, it's difficult to think
that no apple at all was there.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.096
I mean some stepping stone,
some specific conditions

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.136
that made universal gravitation
not impossible to conceive.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.536
And definitely this was not impossible,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.136
at least for Newton.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.416
It was possible,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.496
and for some reason, it was also there,

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.296
available at some point,
easy to pick as an apple.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.936
Here is the apple.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.176
And what about Einstein?

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.496
Was relativity theory another big leap
in the history of ideas

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.176
no one else could even conceive?

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.656
Or rather, was it again
something adjacent and possible,

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.776
to Einstein of course,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.016
and he got there by small steps
and his very peculiar scientific path?

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.496
Of course we cannot conceive this path,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.000
but this doesn't mean
that the path was not there.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.616
So all of this seems very evocative,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.176
but I would say hardly concrete

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.776
if we really want to grasp
the origin of great ideas

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.816
and more generally the way
in which the new enters our lives.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.816
As a physicist, as a scientist,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.016
I have learned that posing
the right questions

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.056
is half of the solution.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.816
But I think now we start having
a great conceptual framework

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.016
to conceive and address
the right questions.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.496
So let me drive you
to the edge of what is known,

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.616
or at least, what I know,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.696
and let me show you that what is known

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.296
could be a powerful
and fascinating starting point

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.416
to grasp the deep meaning
of words like novelty, innovation,

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.000
creativity perhaps.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.216
So we are discussing the "new,"

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.896
and of course, the science behind it.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.896
The new can enter our lives
in many different ways,

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.616
can be very personal,

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.576
like I meet a new person,

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.896
I read a new book,
or I listen to a new song.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.176
Or it could be global,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.256
I mean, something we call innovation.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.456
It could be a new theory,
a new technology,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.056
but it could also be a new book
if you're the writer,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.416
or it could be a new song
if you're the composer.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.736
In all of these global cases,
the new is for everyone,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.576
but experiencing the new
can be also frightening,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.336
so the new can also frighten us.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.536
But still, experiencing the new
means exploring a very peculiar space,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.656
the space of what could be,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.856
the space of the possible,
the space of possibilities.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.336
It's a very weird space,
so I'll try to get you through this space.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.376
So it could be a physical space.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.016
So in this case, for instance,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.096
novelty could be climbing
Machu Picchu for the first time,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.040
as I did in 2016.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.776
It could be a conceptual space,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.216
so acquiring new information,
making sense of it, in a word, learning.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.176
It could be a biological space.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.296
I mean, think about the never-ending
fight of viruses and bacteria

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.256
with our immune system.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.016
And now comes the bad news.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.336
We are very, very bad
at grasping this space.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.376
Think of it. Let's make an experiment.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.280
Try to think about all the possible things
you could do in the next, say, 24 hours.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.976
Here the key word is "all."

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.800
Of course you can conceive a few options,
like having a drink, writing a letter,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.016
also sleeping during this boring talk,

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.736
if you can.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.416
But not all of them.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.376
So think about an alien invasion,
now, here, in Milan,

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.520
or me -- I stopped thinking
for 15 minutes.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.576
So it's very difficult
to conceive this space,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.776
but actually we have an excuse.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.296
So it's not so easy to conceive this space

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.815
because we are trying to conceive
the occurrence of something brand new,

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:35.816
so something that never occurred before,

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.320
so we don't have clues.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.936
A typical solution could be

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.176
looking at the future
with the eyes of the past,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.496
so relying on all
the time series of past events

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.016
and hoping that this is enough
to predict the future.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.216
But we know this is not working.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.456
For instance, this was the first attempt
for weather forecasts, and it failed.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.896
And it failed because
of the great complexity

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.856
of the underlying phenomenon.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.496
So now we know that predictions
had to be based on modeling,

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.016
which means creating
a synthetic model of the system,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.176
simulating this model
and then projecting the system

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.736
into the future through this model.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.696
And now we can do this in a lot of cases

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.600
with the help of a lot of data.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.896
Looking at the future
with the eye of the past

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.656
could be misleading also for machines.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.896
Think about it.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.720
Now picture yourself for a second
in the middle of the Australian Outback.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.160
You stand there under the sun.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.056
So you see something weird happening.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.816
The car suddenly stops

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.896
very, very far from a kangaroo
crossing the street.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.376
You look closer

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.816
and you realize
that the car has no driver.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.856
It is not restarting, even after
the kangaroo is not there anymore.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.776
So for some reasons,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.336
the algorithms driving the car
cannot make sense

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.040
of this strange beast
jumping here and there on the street.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.840
So it just stops.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.856
Now, I should tell you,
this is a true story.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.576
It happened a few months ago
to Volvo's self-driving cars

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.536
in the middle of the Australian Outback.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.256
(Laughter)

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.256
It is a general problem,

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.256
and I guess this will affect
more and more in the near future

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.840
artificial intelligence
and machine learning.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.416
It's also a very old problem,
I would say 17th century,

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.576
but I guess now we have new tools
and new clues to start solving it.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.776
So let me take a step back,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.536
five years back.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.536
Italy. Rome. Winter.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.136
So the winter of 2012
was very special in Rome.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.720
Rome witnessed one of the greatest
snowfalls of its history.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.216
That winter was special also
for me and my colleagues,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.736
because we had an insight
about the possible mathematical scheme --

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.736
again, possible,
possible mathematical scheme,

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.600
to conceive the occurrence of the new.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.936
I remember that day
because it was snowing,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.736
so due to the snowfall,
we were blocked, stuck in my department,

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.176
and we couldn't go home,

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.256
so we got another coffee, we relaxed

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.056
and we kept discussing.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.776
But at some point --
maybe not that date, precisely --

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.696
at some point we made the connection

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.696
between the problem of the new

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.136
and a beautiful concept
proposed years before

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.936
by Stuart Kauffman,

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.000
the adjacent possible.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.776
So the adjacent possible
consists of all those things.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.536
It could be ideas, it could be molecules,
it could be technological products

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.496
that are one step away

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.256
from what actually exists,

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.816
and you can achieve them
through incremental modifications

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.400
and recombinations
of the existing material.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.416
So for instance, if I speak
about the space of my friends,

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.416
my adjacent possible would be
the set of all friends of my friends

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.840
not already my friends.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.976
I hope that's clear.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.816
But now if I meet a new person,

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.536
say Briar,

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.616
all her friends would immediately enter
my adjacent possible,

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.160
pushing its boundaries further.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.376
So if you really want to look
from the mathematical point of view --

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.800
I'm sure you want --

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.176
you can actually look at this picture.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.096
So suppose now this is your universe.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.376
I know I'm asking a lot.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.040
I mean, this is your universe.
Now you are the red spot.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.936
And the green spot
is the adjacent possible for you,

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.056
so something you've never touched before.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.416
So you do your normal life.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.096
You move. You move in the space.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.776
You have a drink.
You meet friends. You read a book.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.696
At some point,
you end up on the green spot,

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.896
so you meet Briar for the first time.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.256
And what happens?

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.576
So what happens is there is a new part,

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.056
a brand new part of the space,

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.336
becoming possible for you
in this very moment,

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.216
even without any possibility
for you to foresee this

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.296
before touching that point.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.016
And behind this there will be
a huge set of points

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.736
that could become possible
at some later stages.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.576
So you see the space
of the possible is very peculiar,

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.816
because it's not predefined.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.136
It's not something we can predefine.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.536
It's something that gets
continuously shaped and reshaped

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.160
by our actions and our choices.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.576
So we were so fascinated
by these connections we made --

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.496
scientists are like this.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.816
And based on this,

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.056
we conceived our mathematical formulation
for the adjacent possible,

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.536
20 years after the original
Kauffman proposals.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.696
In our theory -- this is a key point --

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.256
I mean, it's crucially based
on a complex interplay

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:45.056
between the way in which
this space of possibilities expands

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.616
and gets restructured,

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.136
and the way in which we explore it.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.016
After the epiphany of 2012,

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.696
we got back to work, real work,

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.616
because we had to work out this theory,

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.056
and we came up with
a certain number of predictions

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.336
to be tested in real life.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.256
Of course, we need a testable framework

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.736
to study innovation.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.816
So let me drive you
across a few predictions we made.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.736
The first one concerns
the pace of innovation,

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:16.656
so the rate at which you observe novelties
in very different systems.

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.176
So our theory predicts
that the rate of innovation

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.136
should follow a universal curve,

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.480
like this one.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.880
This is the rate of innovation versus time
in very different conditions.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.336
And somehow, we predict
that the rate of innovation

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.056
should decrease steadily over time.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.176
So somehow, innovation
is predicted to become more difficult

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.120
as your progress over time.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.496
It's neat. It's interesting.
It's beautiful. We were happy.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.696
But the question is, is that true?

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.600
Of course we should check with reality.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.976
So we went back to reality

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.136
and we collected a lot of data,
terabytes of data,

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.496
tracking innovation in Wikipedia, Twitter,

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.736
the way in which we write free software,

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.400
even the way we listen to music.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.896
I cannot tell you, we were
so amazed and pleased and thrilled

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.416
to discover that the same predictions
we made in the theory

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.016
were actually satisfied in real systems,

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.576
many different real systems.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.096
We were so excited.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.936
Of course, apparently,
we were on the right track,

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.456
but of course, we couldn't stop,

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.976
so we didn't stop.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.096
So we kept going on,

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.176
and at some point
we made another discovery

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.736
that we dubbed "correlated novelties."

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.016
It's very simple.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.936
So I guess we all experience this.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.520
So you listen to "Suzanne"
by Leonard Cohen,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.096
and this experience
triggers your passion for Cohen

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.936
so that you start frantically
listening to his whole production.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:46.256
And then you realize
that Fabrizio De André here

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:48.256
recorded an Italian version of "Suzanne,"

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.296
and so on and so forth.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.296
So somehow for some reason,

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.216
the very notion of adjacent possible
is already encoding the common belief

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.800
that one thing leads to another

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.456
in many different systems.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.776
But the reason why we were thrilled

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.324
is because actually
we could give, for the first time,

00:12:06.348 --> 00:12:08.416
a scientific substance to this intuition

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.096
and start making predictions

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.536
about the way in which
we experience the new.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.880
So novelties are correlated.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.376
They are not occurring randomly.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.856
And this is good news,

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:24.616
because it implies
that impossible missions

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.016
might not be so impossible after all,

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.136
if we are guided by our intuition,

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.920
somehow leading us
to trigger a positive chain reaction.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.336
But there is a third consequence
of the existence of the adjacent possible

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.896
that we named "waves of novelties."

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.616
So just to make this simple, so in music,

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.016
without waves of novelties,

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:52.096
we would still be listening
all the time to Mozart or Beethoven,

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.616
which is great,

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.296
but we don't do this all the time.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:00.336
We also listen to the Pet Shop Boys
or Justin Bieber -- well, some of us do.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.536
(Laughter)

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.456
So we could see very clearly
all of these patterns

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.216
in the huge amounts of data
we collected and analyzed.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.896
For instance, we discovered
that popular hits in music

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.816
are continuously born, you know that,

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:19.280
and then they disappear,
still leaving room for evergreens.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.216
So somehow waves of novelties ebb and flow

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.816
while the tides always hold the classics.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.800
There is this coexistence
between evergreens and new hits.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.616
Not only our theory
predicts these waves of novelties.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.096
This would be trivial.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.016
But it also explains why they are there,

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.016
and they are there for a specific reason,

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.256
because we as humans
display different strategies

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.136
in the space of the possible.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.296
So some of us tend to retrace
already known paths.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.640
So we say they exploit.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.216
Some of us always launch
into new adventures.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.936
We say they explore.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.256
And what we discovered is
all the systems we investigated

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.456
are right at the edge
between these two strategies,

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.016
something like 80 percent exploiting,
20 percent exploring,

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.720
something like
blade runners of innovation.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.936
So it seems that the wise balance,
you could also say a conservative balance,

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:22.936
between past and future,
between exploitation and exploration,

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.376
is already in place
and perhaps needed in our system.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.016
But again the good news is
now we have scientific tools

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.776
to investigate this equilibrium,

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.080
perhaps pushing it further
in the near future.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.616
So as you can imagine,

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.800
I was really fascinated by all this.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:48.056
Our mathematical scheme
is already providing cues and hints

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.136
to investigate the space of possibilities

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.176
and the way in which
all of us create it and explore it.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.536
But there is more.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.936
This, I guess, is a starting point
of something that has the potential

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.576
to become a wonderful journey
for a scientific investigation of the new,

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.880
but also I would say
a personal investigation of the new.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.216
And I guess this can have
a lot of consequences

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.376
and a huge impact in key activities

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:19.720
like learning, education,
research, business.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.576
So for instance, if you think
about artificial intelligence,

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.736
I am sure -- I mean,
artificial intelligence,

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.576
we need to rely in the near future

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.416
more and more on the structure
of the adjacent possible,

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.376
to restructure it, to change it,

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.720
but also to cope
with the unknowns of the future.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.256
In parallel, we have a lot of tools,

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.776
new tools now, to investigate
how creativity works

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.400
and what triggers innovation.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.256
And the aim of all this
is to raise a generation of people

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.896
able to come up with new ideas
to face the challenges in front of us.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.136
We all know.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.256
I think it's a long way to go,

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.336
but the questions, and the tools,

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.920
are now there, adjacent and possible.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.936
Thank you.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.840
(Applause)
