00:00:12.562 --> 00:00:15.507
I'd like to tell you
about a patient named Donna.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.704
In this photograph,
Donna was in her mid-70s,

00:00:18.728 --> 00:00:20.103
a vigorous, healthy woman,

00:00:20.127 --> 00:00:22.068
the matriarch of a large clan.

00:00:22.586 --> 00:00:24.991
She had a family history
of heart disease, however,

00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:28.354
and one day, she had the sudden onset
of crushing chest pain.

00:00:28.742 --> 00:00:31.410
Now unfortunately, rather than
seeking medical attention,

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:35.350
Donna took to her bed for about 12 hours
until the pain passed.

00:00:35.374 --> 00:00:37.434
The next time she went
to see her physician,

00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:39.095
he performed an electrocardiogram,

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:41.563
and this showed that she'd had
a large heart attack,

00:00:41.587 --> 00:00:44.551
or a "myocardial infarction"
in medical parlance.

00:00:45.496 --> 00:00:48.546
After this heart attack,
Donna was never quite the same.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.192
Her energy levels progressively waned,

00:00:51.216 --> 00:00:54.874
she couldn't do a lot of the physical
activities she'd previously enjoyed.

00:00:54.898 --> 00:00:58.012
It got to the point where she couldn't
keep up with her grandkids,

00:00:58.036 --> 00:01:01.177
and it was even too much work
to go out to the end of the driveway

00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:02.352
to pick up the mail.

00:01:02.376 --> 00:01:05.429
One day, her granddaughter
came by to walk the dog,

00:01:05.453 --> 00:01:07.876
and she found her grandmother
dead in the chair.

00:01:08.673 --> 00:01:13.020
Doctors said it was a cardiac arrhythmia
that was secondary to heart failure.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.984
But the last thing that I should tell you

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:18.878
is that Donna was not just
an ordinary patient.

00:01:18.902 --> 00:01:20.458
Donna was my mother.

00:01:21.445 --> 00:01:24.889
Stories like ours are,
unfortunately, far too common.

00:01:24.913 --> 00:01:27.872
Heart disease is the number one killer
in the entire world.

00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:29.055
In the United States,

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.207
it's the most common reason
patients are admitted to the hospital,

00:01:32.231 --> 00:01:34.289
and it's our number one
health care expense.

00:01:34.313 --> 00:01:37.241
We spend over a 100 billion dollars --
billion with a "B" --

00:01:37.265 --> 00:01:38.527
in this country every year

00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:40.383
on the treatment of heart disease.

00:01:40.407 --> 00:01:43.284
Just for reference, that's more than
twice the annual budget

00:01:43.308 --> 00:01:44.625
of the state of Washington.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.257
What makes this disease so deadly?

00:01:47.757 --> 00:01:51.643
Well, it all starts with the fact that
the heart is the least regenerative organ

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:53.003
in the human body.

00:01:53.502 --> 00:01:57.470
Now, a heart attack happens when
a blood clot forms in a coronary artery

00:01:57.494 --> 00:01:59.989
that feeds blood to the wall of the heart.

00:02:00.013 --> 00:02:02.111
This plugs the blood flow,

00:02:02.135 --> 00:02:04.550
and the heart muscle
is very metabolically active,

00:02:04.574 --> 00:02:05.922
and so it dies very quickly,

00:02:05.946 --> 00:02:09.734
within just a few hours
of having its blood flow interrupted.

00:02:10.446 --> 00:02:12.845
Since the heart can't
grow back new muscle,

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:15.293
it heals by scar formation.

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:18.113
This leaves the patient with a deficit

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:20.443
in the amount of heart
muscle that they have.

00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:23.383
And in too many people,
their illness progresses to the point

00:02:23.407 --> 00:02:27.265
where the heart can no longer keep up
with the body's demand for blood flow.

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:32.352
This imbalance between supply and demand
is the crux of heart failure.

00:02:34.877 --> 00:02:38.246
So when I talk to people
about this problem,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.079
I often get a shrug
and a statement to the effect of,

00:02:42.103 --> 00:02:44.840
"Well, you know, Chuck,
we've got to die of something."

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:48.287
(Laughter)

00:02:48.311 --> 00:02:51.668
And yeah, but what this also tells me

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:57.286
is that we've resigned ourselves to this
as the status quo because we have to.

00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:00.047
Or do we?

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.152
I think there's a better way,

00:03:02.176 --> 00:03:05.679
and this better way involves the use
of stem cells as medicines.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.351
So what, exactly, are stem cells?

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.997
If you look at them under the microscope,
there's not much going on.

00:03:12.021 --> 00:03:13.917
They're just simple little round cells.

00:03:13.941 --> 00:03:16.454
But that belies two remarkable attributes.

00:03:16.922 --> 00:03:19.237
The first is they can divide like crazy.

00:03:19.261 --> 00:03:22.095
So I can take a single cell,
and in a month's time,

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:24.087
I can grow this up to billions of cells.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.351
The second is they can differentiate
or become more specialized,

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:33.520
so these simple little round cells
can turn into skin, can turn into brain,

00:03:33.544 --> 00:03:35.719
can turn into kidney and so forth.

00:03:36.377 --> 00:03:39.463
Now, some tissues in our bodies
are chock-full of stem cells.

00:03:39.487 --> 00:03:43.384
Our bone marrow, for example, cranks out
billions of blood cells every day.

00:03:43.808 --> 00:03:46.242
Other tissues like the heart
are quite stable,

00:03:46.266 --> 00:03:50.426
and as far as we can tell,
the heart lacks stem cells entirely.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.411
So for the heart, we're going to have
to bring stem cells in from the outside,

00:03:54.435 --> 00:03:57.315
and for this, we turn to
the most potent stem cell type,

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:59.342
the pluripotent stem cell.

00:03:59.366 --> 00:04:01.082
Pluripotent stem cells are so named

00:04:01.106 --> 00:04:04.175
because they can turn into
any of the 240-some cell types

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:06.053
that make up the human body.

00:04:06.684 --> 00:04:08.667
So this is my big idea:

00:04:08.691 --> 00:04:11.445
I want to take human
pluripotent stem cells,

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:13.596
grow them up in large numbers,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.420
differentiate them
into cardiac muscle cells

00:04:16.444 --> 00:04:18.185
and then take them out of the dish

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.113
and transplant them into the hearts
of patients who have had heart attacks.

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:25.656
I think this is going to reseed the wall
with new muscle tissue,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.272
and this will restore
contractile function to the heart.

00:04:29.296 --> 00:04:34.951
(Applause)

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.805
Now, before you applaud too much,
this was my idea 20 years ago.

00:04:39.829 --> 00:04:41.868
(Laughter)

00:04:41.892 --> 00:04:45.792
And I was young,
I was full of it, and I thought,

00:04:45.816 --> 00:04:48.141
five years in the lab,
and we'll crank this out,

00:04:48.165 --> 00:04:50.739
and we'll have this into the clinic.

00:04:50.763 --> 00:04:52.793
Let me tell you what really happened.

00:04:52.817 --> 00:04:53.936
(Laughter)

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.665
We began with the quest to turn these
pluripotent stem cells into heart muscle.

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:01.205
And our first experiments worked, sort of.

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.995
We got these little clumps of beating
human heart muscle in the dish,

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:07.443
and that was cool,
because it said, in principle,

00:05:07.467 --> 00:05:09.729
this should be able to be done.

00:05:09.753 --> 00:05:12.028
But when we got around
to doing the cell counts,

00:05:12.052 --> 00:05:15.083
we found that only one
out of 1,000 of our stem cells

00:05:15.107 --> 00:05:17.525
were actually turning into heart muscle.

00:05:17.937 --> 00:05:23.457
The rest was just a gemisch
of brain and skin and cartilage

00:05:23.481 --> 00:05:25.266
and intestine.

00:05:25.824 --> 00:05:29.153
So how do you coax a cell
that can become anything

00:05:29.177 --> 00:05:31.456
into becoming just a heart muscle cell?

00:05:32.243 --> 00:05:34.838
Well, for this we turned
to the world of embryology.

00:05:34.862 --> 00:05:37.560
For over a century, the embryologists
had been pondering

00:05:37.584 --> 00:05:39.266
the mysteries of heart development.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.647
And they had given us
what was essentially a Google Map

00:05:42.671 --> 00:05:45.151
for how to go from a single fertilized egg

00:05:45.175 --> 00:05:48.276
all the way over to a human
cardiovascular system.

00:05:48.656 --> 00:05:52.387
So we shamelessly absconded
all of this information

00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:56.559
and tried to make human cardiovascular
development happen in a dish.

00:05:57.105 --> 00:05:59.571
It took us about five years, but nowadays,

00:05:59.595 --> 00:06:03.186
we can get 90 percent of our stem cells
to turn into cardiac muscle --

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.283
a 900-fold improvement.

00:06:05.671 --> 00:06:07.171
So this was quite exciting.

00:06:08.112 --> 00:06:11.022
This slide shows you
our current cellular product.

00:06:11.466 --> 00:06:14.755
We grow our heart muscle cells
in little three-dimensional clumps

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:16.289
called cardiac organoids.

00:06:16.313 --> 00:06:19.456
Each of them has 500 to 1,000
heart muscle cells in it.

00:06:20.003 --> 00:06:23.810
If you look closely, you can see these
little organoids are actually twitching;

00:06:23.834 --> 00:06:25.641
each one is beating independently.

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:28.237
But they've got another trick
up their sleeve.

00:06:28.793 --> 00:06:31.964
We took a gene from jellyfish
that live in the Pacific Northwest,

00:06:31.988 --> 00:06:34.388
and we used a technique
called genome editing

00:06:34.412 --> 00:06:37.426
to splice this gene into the stem cells.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.875
And this makes our heart muscle cells
flash green every time they beat.

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:45.588
OK, so now we were finally ready
to begin animal experiments.

00:06:45.612 --> 00:06:47.973
We took our cardiac muscle cells

00:06:47.997 --> 00:06:50.271
and we transplanted them
into the hearts of rats

00:06:50.295 --> 00:06:52.517
that had been given
experimental heart attacks.

00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:56.093
A month later, I peered anxiously
down through my microscope

00:06:56.117 --> 00:06:58.008
to see what we had grown,

00:06:58.032 --> 00:06:59.337
and I saw ...

00:06:59.807 --> 00:07:00.972
nothing.

00:07:01.616 --> 00:07:03.383
Everything had died.

00:07:03.407 --> 00:07:07.355
But we persevered on this,
and we came up with a biochemical cocktail

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:09.683
that we called
our "pro-survival cocktail,"

00:07:09.707 --> 00:07:12.330
and this was enough to allow
our cells to survive

00:07:12.354 --> 00:07:15.432
through the stressful process
of transplantation.

00:07:15.456 --> 00:07:17.606
And now when I looked
through the microscope,

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.145
I could see this fresh, young,
human heart muscle

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:23.218
growing back in the injured wall
of this rat's heart.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.543
So this was getting quite exciting.

00:07:25.567 --> 00:07:27.106
The next question was:

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.747
Will this new muscle beat in synchrony
with the rest of the heart?

00:07:31.453 --> 00:07:32.614
So to answer that,

00:07:32.638 --> 00:07:36.664
we returned to the cells that had
that jellyfish gene in them.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.457
We used these cells essentially
like a space probe

00:07:40.481 --> 00:07:42.721
that we could launch
into a foreign environment

00:07:42.745 --> 00:07:45.065
and then have that flashing
report back to us

00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:47.147
about their biological activity.

00:07:47.171 --> 00:07:49.252
What you're seeing here
is a zoomed-in view,

00:07:49.276 --> 00:07:51.498
a black-and-white image
of a guinea pig's heart

00:07:51.522 --> 00:07:55.123
that was injured and then received
three grafts of our human cardiac muscle.

00:07:55.147 --> 00:07:57.789
So you see those sort of diagonally
running white lines.

00:07:57.813 --> 00:07:59.299
Each of those is a needle track

00:07:59.323 --> 00:08:03.019
that contains a couple of million
human cardiac muscle cells in it.

00:08:03.713 --> 00:08:06.467
And when I start the video,
you can see what we saw

00:08:06.491 --> 00:08:08.511
when we looked through the microscope.

00:08:09.011 --> 00:08:10.574
Our cells are flashing,

00:08:10.598 --> 00:08:12.623
and they're flashing in synchrony,

00:08:12.647 --> 00:08:14.736
back through the walls
of the injured heart.

00:08:15.117 --> 00:08:16.268
What does this mean?

00:08:16.292 --> 00:08:17.776
It means the cells are alive,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.948
they're well, they're beating,

00:08:19.972 --> 00:08:22.201
and they've managed
to connect with one another

00:08:22.225 --> 00:08:24.297
so that they're beating in synchrony.

00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:26.436
But it gets even more
interesting than this.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.903
If you look at that tracing
that's along the bottom,

00:08:28.927 --> 00:08:32.272
that's the electrocardiogram
from the guinea pig's own heart.

00:08:32.296 --> 00:08:35.449
And if you line up the flashing
with the heartbeat

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:36.773
that's shown on the bottom,

00:08:36.797 --> 00:08:39.984
what you can see is there's a perfect
one-to-one correspondence.

00:08:40.008 --> 00:08:44.474
In other words, the guinea pig's
natural pacemaker is calling the shots,

00:08:44.498 --> 00:08:47.482
and the human heart muscle cells
are following in lockstep

00:08:47.506 --> 00:08:48.994
like good soldiers.

00:08:49.922 --> 00:08:54.538
(Applause)

00:08:56.017 --> 00:08:59.017
Our current studies have moved into
what I think is going to be

00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:01.702
the best possible predictor
of a human patient,

00:09:01.726 --> 00:09:03.843
and that's into macaque monkeys.

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:08.446
This next slide shows you
a microscopic image

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.912
from the heart of a macaque that was given
an experimental heart attack

00:09:12.936 --> 00:09:15.015
and then treated with a saline injection.

00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:17.272
This is essentially like
a placebo treatment

00:09:17.296 --> 00:09:19.461
to show the natural history
of the disease.

00:09:19.485 --> 00:09:21.753
The macaque heart muscle is shown in red,

00:09:21.777 --> 00:09:25.281
and in blue, you see the scar tissue
that results from the heart attack.

00:09:25.305 --> 00:09:29.187
So as you look as this, you can see how
there's a big deficiency in the muscle

00:09:29.211 --> 00:09:31.129
in part of the wall of the heart.

00:09:31.153 --> 00:09:34.396
And it's not hard to imagine
how this heart would have a tough time

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.888
generating much force.

00:09:37.105 --> 00:09:40.481
Now in contrast, this is one
of the stem-cell-treated hearts.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:45.225
Again, you can see
the monkey's heart muscle in red,

00:09:45.249 --> 00:09:47.956
but it's very hard to even see
the blue scar tissue,

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.100
and that's because we've
been able to repopulate it

00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:52.988
with the human heart muscle,

00:09:53.012 --> 00:09:55.194
and so we've got this nice, plump wall.

00:09:55.218 --> 00:09:57.336
OK, let's just take a second and recap.

00:09:57.678 --> 00:10:00.212
I've showed you
that we can take our stem cells

00:10:00.236 --> 00:10:02.748
and differentiate them
into cardiac muscle.

00:10:02.772 --> 00:10:05.972
We've learned how to keep them alive
after transplantation,

00:10:05.996 --> 00:10:09.251
we've showed that they beat
in synchrony with the rest of the heart,

00:10:09.275 --> 00:10:11.270
and we've shown that we can scale them up

00:10:11.294 --> 00:10:15.644
into an animal that is the best possible
predictor of a human's response.

00:10:16.592 --> 00:10:22.355
You'd think that we hit all the roadblocks
that lay in our path, right?

00:10:23.141 --> 00:10:24.331
Turns out, not.

00:10:24.982 --> 00:10:27.377
These macaque studies also taught us

00:10:27.401 --> 00:10:32.104
that our human heart muscle cells created
a period of electrical instability.

00:10:32.128 --> 00:10:35.709
They caused ventricular arrhythmias,
or irregular heartbeats,

00:10:35.733 --> 00:10:37.997
for several weeks after
we transplanted them.

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:42.615
This was quite unexpected, because
we hadn't seen this in smaller animals.

00:10:43.266 --> 00:10:45.053
We've studied it extensively,

00:10:45.077 --> 00:10:49.065
and it turns out that it results
from the fact that our cellular graphs

00:10:49.089 --> 00:10:50.627
are quite immature,

00:10:50.651 --> 00:10:54.233
and immature heart muscle cells
all act like pacemakers.

00:10:54.257 --> 00:10:56.652
So what happens is,
we put them into the heart,

00:10:56.676 --> 00:11:00.121
and there starts to be a competition
with the heart's natural pacemaker

00:11:00.145 --> 00:11:01.764
over who gets to call the shots.

00:11:02.502 --> 00:11:03.665
It would be sort of like

00:11:03.689 --> 00:11:08.306
if you brought a whole gaggle of teenagers
into your orderly household all at once,

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:12.467
and they don't want to follow the rules
and the rhythms of the way you run things,

00:11:12.491 --> 00:11:14.463
and it takes a while to rein everybody in

00:11:14.487 --> 00:11:16.964
and get people working
in a coordinated fashion.

00:11:17.471 --> 00:11:18.720
So our plans at the moment

00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:21.887
are to make the cells go through
this troubled adolescence period

00:11:21.911 --> 00:11:23.893
while they're still in the dish,

00:11:23.917 --> 00:11:28.338
and then we'll transplant them in
in the post-adolescent phase,

00:11:28.362 --> 00:11:30.332
where they should be much more orderly

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:33.086
and be ready to listen
to their marching orders.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.914
In the meantime, it turns out
we can actually do quite well

00:11:35.938 --> 00:11:38.342
by treating with
anti-arrhythmia drugs as well.

00:11:39.064 --> 00:11:41.654
So one big question still remains,

00:11:41.678 --> 00:11:44.967
and that is, of course, the whole purpose
that we set out to do this:

00:11:44.991 --> 00:11:48.313
Can we actually restore function
to the injured heart?

00:11:49.218 --> 00:11:50.478
To answer this question,

00:11:50.502 --> 00:11:54.268
we went to something that's called
"left ventricular ejection fraction."

00:11:54.292 --> 00:11:56.622
Ejection fraction is simply
the amount of blood

00:11:56.646 --> 00:11:59.012
that is squeezed
out of the chamber of the heart

00:11:59.036 --> 00:12:00.208
with each beat.

00:12:00.232 --> 00:12:02.691
Now, in healthy macaques,
like in healthy people,

00:12:02.715 --> 00:12:05.185
ejection fractions are about 65 percent.

00:12:05.748 --> 00:12:09.868
After a heart attack, ejection fraction
drops down to about 40 percent,

00:12:09.892 --> 00:12:12.726
so these animals are
well on their way to heart failure.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.025
In the animals that receive
a placebo injection,

00:12:15.049 --> 00:12:16.624
when we scan them a month later,

00:12:16.648 --> 00:12:18.937
we see that ejection
fraction is unchanged,

00:12:18.961 --> 00:12:21.822
because the heart, of course,
doesn't spontaneously recover.

00:12:22.489 --> 00:12:25.272
But in every one of the animals
that received a graft

00:12:25.296 --> 00:12:27.007
of human cardiac muscle cells,

00:12:27.031 --> 00:12:30.029
we see a substantial improvement
in cardiac function.

00:12:30.053 --> 00:12:33.987
This averaged eight points,
so from 40 to 48 percent.

00:12:34.011 --> 00:12:37.067
What I can tell you
is that eight points is better

00:12:37.091 --> 00:12:39.419
than anything that's
on the market right now

00:12:39.443 --> 00:12:41.454
for treating patients with heart attacks.

00:12:41.478 --> 00:12:44.207
It's better than everything
we have put together.

00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:46.384
So if we could do
eight points in the clinic,

00:12:46.408 --> 00:12:49.419
I think this would be a big deal
that would make a large impact

00:12:49.443 --> 00:12:50.629
on human health.

00:12:51.137 --> 00:12:54.718
But it gets more exciting.

00:12:54.742 --> 00:12:57.421
That was just four weeks
after transplantation.

00:12:57.445 --> 00:13:00.345
If we extend these studies
out to three months,

00:13:00.369 --> 00:13:04.431
we get a full 22-point gain
in ejection fraction.

00:13:04.455 --> 00:13:08.453
(Applause)

00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:14.324
Function in these
treated hearts is so good

00:13:14.348 --> 00:13:18.178
that if we didn't know up front
that these animals had had a heart attack,

00:13:18.202 --> 00:13:23.678
we would never be able to tell
from their functional studies.

00:13:24.757 --> 00:13:28.411
Going forward, our plan
is to start phase one,

00:13:28.435 --> 00:13:32.080
first in human trials here at
the University of Washington in 2020 --

00:13:32.104 --> 00:13:34.096
two short years from now.

00:13:34.834 --> 00:13:37.902
Presuming these studies
are safe and effective,

00:13:37.926 --> 00:13:39.872
which I think they're going to be,

00:13:39.896 --> 00:13:44.037
our plan is to scale this up
and ship these cells all around the world

00:13:44.061 --> 00:13:46.361
for the treatment of patients
with heart disease.

00:13:46.996 --> 00:13:48.958
Given the global burden of this illness,

00:13:48.982 --> 00:13:52.530
I could easily imagine this treating
a million or more patients a year.

00:13:52.916 --> 00:13:55.572
So I envision a time,
maybe a decade from now,

00:13:55.596 --> 00:13:58.805
where a patient like my mother
will have actual treatments

00:13:58.829 --> 00:14:02.943
that can address the root cause
and not just manage her symptoms.

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:06.039
This all comes from the fact
that stem cells give us the ability

00:14:06.063 --> 00:14:07.762
to repair the human body

00:14:07.786 --> 00:14:09.996
from its component parts.

00:14:10.774 --> 00:14:12.865
In the not-too-distant future,

00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:15.976
repairing humans is going to go

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.220
from something that is
far-fetched science fiction

00:14:19.244 --> 00:14:21.511
into common medical practice.

00:14:22.043 --> 00:14:23.372
And when this happens,

00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:25.474
it's going to have
a transformational effect

00:14:25.498 --> 00:14:29.267
that rivals the development
of vaccinations and antibiotics.

00:14:30.148 --> 00:14:31.595
Thank you for your attention.

00:14:31.619 --> 00:14:34.232
(Applause)
