00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.440
Three years ago,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.496
I started building a decentralized web

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.800
because I was worried
about the future of our internet.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.296
The current internet we are using
is about gatekeepers.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.696
If you want to reach something on the web,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.096
then you need to go
through multiple middlemen.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.576
First, a domain name server,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.136
then a server hosting company,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.896
which usually points you to a third party,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.880
to a web hosting service.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.600
And this happens every time
you want to reach a website on the web.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.896
But these gatekeepers are
vulnerable to internet attacks

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.720
and also makes the censorship
and the surveillance easier.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.760
And the situation is getting worse.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.536
Everything is moving to the cloud,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.640
where the data is hosted
by giant corporations.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.680
This move creates much,
much more powerful middlemen.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.856
Now, move to the cloud makes sense

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.936
because this way it's easier and cheaper

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.096
for the developers
and the service operators.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.320
They don't have to worry
about maintaining the physical servers.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.936
I can't blame them, but I found
this trend to be very dangerous,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.216
because this way, these giant corporations

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.080
have unlimited control
over the hosting services.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.920
And it's very easy to abuse this power.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.216
For example, last year, a CEO of a company

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.856
that acts as a gatekeeper
for nine million websites

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.976
decided, after some public pressure,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.416
that one of the sites it manages,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.040
a far right page, should be blocked.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.400
He then sent an internal email
to his coworkers.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.200
"This was an arbitrary decision.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.176
I woke up this morning in a bad mood

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.840
and decided to kick them
off the Internet."

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.856
Even he admits,

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.920
"No one should have this power."

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.616
As a response, one of
the employees asked him,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.280
"Is this the day the Internet dies?"

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.216
I don't think we are actually
killing the internet,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.176
but I do think that we are in the middle

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.976
of a kind of irresponsible
centralization process

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.640
that makes our internet more fragile.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.456
The decentralized, people-to-people web

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.536
solves this problem
by removing the central points,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.160
the web-hosting services.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.136
It empowers the users

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.680
to have host sites they want to preserve.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.280
On this network, the sites get downloaded
directly from other visitors.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.456
This means, if you have a site
with 100 visitors,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.680
then it's hosted
[by] 100 computers around the world.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.400
Basically, this is a people-powered
version of the internet.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.736
The security of the network
is provided by public-key cryptography.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.256
This makes sure that no one
can modify the sites

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.960
but only the real owner.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.816
Think of it like instead of getting
electricity from big power plants,

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.896
you put solar panels on top of your house,

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.816
and if your neighbor down the street
needs some extra energy,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.520
then they can just download
some from your house.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.576
So by using the decentralized web,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.920
we can help to keep content
accessible for other visitors.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.496
And by that, it means

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.176
that we can also fight against things

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.840
that we feel are unjust,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.200
like censorship.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.400
In China, the internet
is tightly controlled.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.456
They can't criticize the government,

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.496
organize a protest,

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.256
and it's also forbidden to post

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.840
a kind of emoticon to remember the victims
of the Tiananmen Square Massacre.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.101
With the decentralized web,
it's not the government that decides

00:04:18.126 --> 00:04:20.120
what gets seen and what doesn't.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.096
It's the people,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.280
which makes the web more democratic.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.016
But at the same time,
it's hard to use this network

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.815
to do something that is clearly illegal

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:33.216
everywhere in the world,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.776
as the users probably
don't want to endanger themselves

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.280
hosting these kinds
of problematic content.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.656
Another increasing threat

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.440
to internet freedom

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.840
is overregulation.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.256
I have the impression

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.976
that our delegates

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.856
who vote on the internet regulation laws

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.080
are not fully aware of their decisions.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.416
For example, the European Parliament
has a new law on the table,

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.416
a new copyright protection law,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.080
that has a part called Article 13.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.016
If it passes, it would require
every big website

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.296
to implement a filter

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.616
that automatically blocks content

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.560
based on rules controlled
by big corporations.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.456
The original idea is
to protect copyrighted materials,

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.976
but it would endanger many other things
we do on the internet:

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.520
blogging, criticizing,
discussing, linking and sharing.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.576
Google and YouTube
already have similar systems

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.880
and they are receiving
100,000 takedown requests every hour.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.656
Of course, they can't process
this amount of data by hand,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.336
so they are using machine learning

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.920
to decide if it's really
a copyright violation or not.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.040
But these filters do make mistakes.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.816
They're removing everything
from documentation of human rights abuses,

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.736
lectures about copyrights

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.976
and search results

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.040
that point to criticism
of this new Article 13.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.600
Beside of that, they are also
removing many other things.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.776
And sometimes, these filters
aren't just removing the specific content,

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.576
but it could also lead
to loss of your linked accounts:

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.776
your email address,
your documents, your photos,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.976
or your unfinished book,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.720
which happened
with the writer Dennis Cooper.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.416
It's not hard to see
how a system like this could be abused

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.640
by politicians and corporate competitors.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:02.056
This Article 13, the extension of these
automated filters to the whole internet,

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.216
got strong opposition

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.616
from Wikipedia, Github,
Mozilla, and many others,

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:15.176
including the original founders
of the internet and the World Wide Web,

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.080
Vint Cerf and Tim Berners-Lee.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.016
But despite this strong opposition,

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.416
on the last European Parliament vote,

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.320
two thirds of the representatives
supported this law.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.800
The final vote will be early 2019.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.896
The result is important,

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.616
but whatever happens,

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.936
I'm pretty sure it will be followed
by many other similar proposals

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.160
around the world.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.456
These kinds of regulations
would be very hard to enforce

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.936
through a decentralized web,

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.240
as there is no hosting companies.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.280
The websites are served
by the visitors themselves.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.920
I started to build
this network three years ago.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:07.376
Since then, I've spent thousands,
tens of thousands of hours

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.600
on the development.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.376
Why?

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.176
Why would anyone spend thousands of hours
on something anyone can freely copy,

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.400
rename, or even sell?

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.336
Well, in my case,

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.800
one of the reasons was
to do something meaningful.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.256
During my daily regular job
as a web developer,

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.496
I didn't have the feeling
that I'm working on something

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.160
that had a chance to be a bigger than me.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.816
Simply, I just wanted to make
my short presence in this world

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.400
to be meaningful.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.080
Last year, the Great Firewall of China
started blocking this network I created.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.655
This move officially made me the enemy

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:56.120
of the government-supported
internet censorship.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.696
Since then, it's been really
a game of cat and mouse.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.456
They make new rules in the firewall

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.496
and I try to react to it as fast as I can

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.616
so the users can keep hosting content
and create websites

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:16.000
that otherwise would be censored
by the centralized Chinese internet.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.760
My other motivation
to create this network was worry.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:28.296
I fear that the future of our internet
is out of our control.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.736
The increasing centralization
and the proposed laws

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.296
are threatening our freedom of speech

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.560
and, by that, our democracy.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.776
So for me, building a decentralized web

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.016
means creating a safe harbor,

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:50.856
a space where the rules are not written
by big corporations and political parties,

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.640
but by the people.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.056
Thank you.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.480
(Applause)
