00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:16.826
Say you're at the beach,
and you get sand in your eyes.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.484
How do you know the sand is there?

00:00:18.508 --> 00:00:22.125
You obviously can't see it,
but if you are a normal, healthy human,

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:23.152
you can feel it,

00:00:23.176 --> 00:00:26.976
that sensation of extreme discomfort,
also known as pain.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.976
Now, pain makes you do something,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.976
in this case, rinse your eyes
until the sand is gone.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.789
And how do you know the sand is gone?

00:00:33.813 --> 00:00:35.631
Exactly. Because there's no more pain.

00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:37.898
There are people who don't feel pain.

00:00:37.922 --> 00:00:40.468
Now, that might sound cool, but it's not.

00:00:40.492 --> 00:00:43.976
If you can't feel pain, you could
get hurt, or even hurt yourself

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.654
and never know it.

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:47.816
Pain is your body's early warning system.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.891
It protects you from the world
around you, and from yourself.

00:00:52.103 --> 00:00:55.929
As we grow, we install pain detectors
in most areas of our body.

00:00:55.953 --> 00:00:58.268
These detectors
are specialized nerve cells

00:00:58.292 --> 00:00:59.775
called nociceptors

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:03.371
that stretch from your spinal cord
to your skin, your muscles, your joints,

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:05.447
your teeth and some
of your internal organs.

00:01:06.431 --> 00:01:09.420
Just like all nerve cells,
they conduct electrical signals,

00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:13.192
sending information from wherever
they're located back to your brain.

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:15.822
But, unlike other nerve cells,

00:01:15.846 --> 00:01:19.305
nociceptors only fire if something
happens that could cause

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:20.684
or is causing damage.

00:01:21.717 --> 00:01:24.098
So, gently touch the tip of a needle.

00:01:24.122 --> 00:01:27.075
You'll feel the metal,
and those are your regular nerve cells.

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:28.668
But you won't feel any pain.

00:01:28.692 --> 00:01:30.852
Now, the harder you push
against the needle,

00:01:30.876 --> 00:01:33.776
the closer you get
to the nociceptor threshold.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.134
Push hard enough,
and you'll cross that threshold

00:01:36.158 --> 00:01:37.520
and the nociceptors fire,

00:01:37.544 --> 00:01:40.402
telling your body to stop doing
whatever you're doing.

00:01:40.426 --> 00:01:43.221
But the pain threshold isn't set in stone.

00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:47.976
Certain chemicals can tune nociceptors,
lowering their threshold for pain.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.976
When cells are damaged,
they and other nearby cells

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.976
start producing these tuning
chemicals like crazy,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.976
lowering the nociceptors'
threshold to the point

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.623
where just touch can cause pain.

00:01:59.306 --> 00:02:01.960
And this is where over-the-counter
painkillers come in.

00:02:01.984 --> 00:02:03.576
Aspirin and ibuprofen

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.267
block production of one class
of these tuning chemicals,

00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:07.976
called prostaglandins.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.967
Let's take a look at how they do that.

00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:14.022
When cells are damaged, they release
a chemical called arachidonic acid.

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:16.837
And two enzymes called COX-1 and COX-2

00:02:16.861 --> 00:02:20.596
convert this arachidonic acid
into prostaglandin H2,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.344
which is then converted
into a bunch of other chemicals

00:02:23.368 --> 00:02:24.748
that do a bunch of things,

00:02:24.772 --> 00:02:27.440
including raise your body temperature,
cause inflammation

00:02:27.464 --> 00:02:29.584
and lower the pain threshold.

00:02:30.147 --> 00:02:32.568
Now, all enzymes have an active site.

00:02:32.592 --> 00:02:35.404
That's the place in the enzyme
where the reaction happens.

00:02:35.428 --> 00:02:37.976
The active sites of COX-1 and COX-2

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.869
fit arachidonic acid very cozily.

00:02:40.893 --> 00:02:42.976
As you can see, there is no room to spare.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.976
Now, it's in this active site
that aspirin and ibuprofen do their work.

00:02:47.924 --> 00:02:49.257
So, they work differently.

00:02:49.281 --> 00:02:51.905
Aspirin acts like a spine
from a porcupine.

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:54.072
It enters the active site
and then breaks off,

00:02:54.096 --> 00:02:55.976
leaving half of itself in there,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.576
totally blocking that channel
and making it impossible

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.126
for the arachidonic acid to fit.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.204
This permanently deactivates
COX-1 and COX-2.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.656
Ibuprofen, on the other hand,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.972
enters the active site,

00:03:07.996 --> 00:03:10.788
but doesn't break apart
or change the enzyme.

00:03:10.812 --> 00:03:13.587
COX-1 and COX-2 are free
to spit it out again,

00:03:13.611 --> 00:03:15.976
but for the time
that that ibuprofen is in there,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.465
the enzyme can't bind arachidonic acid,
and can't do its normal chemistry.

00:03:21.241 --> 00:03:24.610
But how do aspirin and ibuprofen
know where the pain is?

00:03:24.634 --> 00:03:25.976
Well, they don't.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.976
Once the drugs are in your bloodstream,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.850
they are carried throughout your body,

00:03:29.874 --> 00:03:32.976
and they go to painful areas
just the same as normal ones.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.521
So that's how aspirin and ibuprofen work.

00:03:36.545 --> 00:03:38.501
But there are other dimensions to pain.

00:03:38.525 --> 00:03:39.976
Neuropathic pain, for example,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.642
is pain caused by damage
to our nervous system itself;

00:03:43.666 --> 00:03:46.190
there doesn't need to be
any sort of outside stimulus.

00:03:46.214 --> 00:03:48.976
And scientists are discovering
that the brain controls

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.976
how we respond to pain signals.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.335
For example, how much pain
you feel can depend on

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.096
whether you're paying attention
to the pain, or even your mood.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.977
Pain is an area of active research.

00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:02.549
If we can understand it better, maybe
we can help people manage it better.
