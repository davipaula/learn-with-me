00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:16.603
Some days, it feels like
the only thing we can agree on

00:00:16.627 --> 00:00:18.960
is that we can't agree on anything.

00:00:20.143 --> 00:00:22.357
Public discourse is broken.

00:00:23.046 --> 00:00:24.760
And we feel that everywhere --

00:00:24.784 --> 00:00:27.204
panelists on TV
are screaming at each other,

00:00:27.228 --> 00:00:30.697
we go online to find
community and connection,

00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:34.121
and we end up leaving
feeling angry and alienated.

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:38.689
In everyday life, probably
because everyone else is yelling,

00:00:38.713 --> 00:00:41.768
we are so scared to get into an argument

00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:44.458
that we're willing not to engage at all.

00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:47.839
Contempt has replaced conversation.

00:00:49.727 --> 00:00:54.378
My mission in life is to help us
disagree productively.

00:00:54.752 --> 00:00:59.299
To find ways to bring truth to light,
to bring new ideas to life.

00:01:00.165 --> 00:01:01.991
I think -- I hope --

00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:04.855
that there is a model
for structured disagreement

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.188
that's kind of mutually respectful

00:01:08.212 --> 00:01:12.037
and assumes a genuine desire
to persuade and be persuaded.

00:01:12.974 --> 00:01:16.283
And to uncover it,
let me take you back a little bit.

00:01:16.307 --> 00:01:20.926
So, when I was 10 years old,
I loved arguing.

00:01:21.442 --> 00:01:23.861
This, like, tantalizing possibility

00:01:23.885 --> 00:01:26.860
that you could convince someone
of your point of view,

00:01:26.884 --> 00:01:29.150
just with the power of your words.

00:01:30.225 --> 00:01:31.710
And perhaps unsurprisingly,

00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:35.209
my parents and teachers
loved this somewhat less.

00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:36.426
(Laughter)

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.484
And in much the same way as they decided

00:01:38.508 --> 00:01:42.712
that four-year-old Julia might benefit
from gymnastics to burn off some energy,

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:45.783
they decided that I might benefit
from joining a debate team.

00:01:45.807 --> 00:01:49.418
That is, kind of, go somewhere
to argue where they were not.

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:51.421
(Laughter)

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:52.993
For the uninitiated,

00:01:53.017 --> 00:01:55.783
the premises of formal debate
are really straightforward:

00:01:55.807 --> 00:01:57.856
there's a big idea on the table --

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.331
that we support civil disobedience,
that we favor free trade --

00:02:02.355 --> 00:02:05.649
and one group of people
who speaks in favor of that idea,

00:02:05.673 --> 00:02:07.061
and one against.

00:02:08.665 --> 00:02:09.876
My first debate

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.847
in the cavernous auditorium
of Canberra Girls Grammar School

00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:16.006
was kind of a bundle
of all of the worst mistakes

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.061
that you see on cable news.

00:02:18.085 --> 00:02:22.425
It felt easier to me to attack
the person making the argument

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:25.315
rather than the substance
of the ideas themselves.

00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:29.093
When that same person challenged my ideas,

00:02:29.117 --> 00:02:32.569
it felt terrible, I felt
humiliated and ashamed.

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:36.744
And it felt to me like
the sophisticated response to that

00:02:36.768 --> 00:02:39.196
was to be as extreme as possible.

00:02:40.736 --> 00:02:45.514
And despite this very shaky entry
into the world of debate, I loved it.

00:02:45.538 --> 00:02:49.982
I saw the possibility, and over many years
worked really hard at it,

00:02:50.006 --> 00:02:53.982
became really skilled
at the technical craft of debate.

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:57.632
I went on to win the World Schools
Debating Championships three times.

00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:00.601
I know, you're just finding out
that this is a thing.

00:03:00.625 --> 00:03:04.133
(Laughter)

00:03:04.157 --> 00:03:07.585
But it wasn't until
I started coaching debaters,

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.069
persuaders who are really
at the top of their game,

00:03:11.093 --> 00:03:12.627
that I actually got it.

00:03:13.188 --> 00:03:18.033
The way that you reach people
is by finding common ground.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.315
It's by separating ideas from identity

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:24.291
and being genuinely open to persuasion.

00:03:24.927 --> 00:03:31.898
Debate is a way to organize conversations
about how the world is, could, should be.

00:03:32.525 --> 00:03:33.735
Or to put it another way,

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:37.028
I would love to offer you
my experience-backed,

00:03:37.052 --> 00:03:40.605
evidence-tested guide
to talking to your cousin about politics

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.633
at your next family dinner;

00:03:42.657 --> 00:03:46.498
reorganizing the way in which your team
debates new proposals;

00:03:46.522 --> 00:03:49.783
thinking about how we change
our public conversation.

00:03:50.617 --> 00:03:52.752
And so, as an entry point into that:

00:03:52.776 --> 00:03:57.133
debate requires that we engage
with the conflicting idea,

00:03:57.157 --> 00:04:00.656
directly, respectfully, face to face.

00:04:01.093 --> 00:04:03.584
The foundation of debate is rebuttal.

00:04:03.608 --> 00:04:07.371
The idea that you make a claim
and I provide a response,

00:04:07.395 --> 00:04:09.461
and you respond to my response.

00:04:10.022 --> 00:04:13.419
Without rebuttal, it's not debate,
it's just pontificating.

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:18.901
And I had originally imagined
that the most successful debaters,

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.829
really excellent persuaders,

00:04:20.853 --> 00:04:24.012
must be great at going to extremes.

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:29.909
They must have some magical ability
to make the polarizing palatable.

00:04:31.101 --> 00:04:34.202
And it took me a really
long time to figure out

00:04:34.226 --> 00:04:37.426
that the opposite is actually true.

00:04:38.014 --> 00:04:43.506
People who disagree the most productively
start by finding common ground,

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.506
no matter how narrow it is.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.458
They identify the thing
that we can all agree on

00:04:48.482 --> 00:04:50.117
and go from there:

00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:54.977
the right to an education,
equality between all people,

00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:57.643
the importance of safer communities.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.759
What they're doing is inviting us

00:04:59.783 --> 00:05:03.366
into what psychologists
call shared reality.

00:05:04.263 --> 00:05:09.141
And shared reality
is the antidote to alternative facts.

00:05:10.438 --> 00:05:13.184
The conflict, of course, is still there.

00:05:13.208 --> 00:05:14.875
That's why it's a debate.

00:05:15.212 --> 00:05:19.612
Shared reality just gives us
a platform to start to talk about it.

00:05:20.465 --> 00:05:24.156
But the trick of debate
is that you end up doing it directly,

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.180
face to face, across the table.

00:05:26.656 --> 00:05:29.954
And research backs up
that that really matters.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.098
Professor Juliana Schroeder
at UC Berkeley and her colleagues

00:05:34.122 --> 00:05:38.051
have research that suggests
that listening to someone's voice

00:05:38.075 --> 00:05:40.519
as they make a controversial argument

00:05:40.543 --> 00:05:42.503
is literally humanizing.

00:05:42.847 --> 00:05:47.047
It makes it easier to engage
with what that person has to say.

00:05:47.617 --> 00:05:51.327
So, step away from the keyboards,
start conversing.

00:05:52.077 --> 00:05:54.729
And if we are to expand
that notion a little bit,

00:05:54.753 --> 00:06:01.609
nothing is stopping us from pressing pause
on a parade of keynote speeches,

00:06:01.633 --> 00:06:05.339
the sequence of very polite
panel discussions,

00:06:05.363 --> 00:06:08.323
and replacing some of that
with a structured debate.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.323
All of our conferences could have,
at their centerpiece,

00:06:12.347 --> 00:06:16.315
a debate over the biggest,
most controversial ideas in the field.

00:06:17.022 --> 00:06:21.067
Each of our weekly team meetings
could devote 10 minutes

00:06:21.091 --> 00:06:25.554
to a debate about a proposal to change
the way in which that team works.

00:06:26.329 --> 00:06:31.523
And as innovative ideas go,
this one is both easy and free.

00:06:31.547 --> 00:06:33.269
You could start tomorrow.

00:06:33.293 --> 00:06:34.443
(Laughter)

00:06:34.872 --> 00:06:37.459
And once we're inside this shared reality,

00:06:37.483 --> 00:06:41.403
debate also requires
that we separate ideas

00:06:41.427 --> 00:06:44.693
from the identity
of the person discussing them.

00:06:45.014 --> 00:06:49.395
So in formal debate, nothing is a topic
unless it is controversial:

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:53.646
that we should raise
the voting age, outlaw gambling.

00:06:54.575 --> 00:06:58.395
But the debaters don't choose their sides.

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:02.474
So that's why it makes no sense
to do what 10-year-old Julia did.

00:07:02.791 --> 00:07:07.197
Attacking the identity of the person
making the argument is irrelevant,

00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:09.196
because they didn't choose it.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.632
Your only winning strategy

00:07:12.656 --> 00:07:18.831
is to engage with the best, clearest,
least personal version of the idea.

00:07:20.292 --> 00:07:24.173
And it might sound impossible
or naive to imagine

00:07:24.197 --> 00:07:28.380
that you could ever take that notion
outside the high school auditorium.

00:07:28.946 --> 00:07:34.829
We spend so much time dismissing ideas
as democrat or republican.

00:07:35.216 --> 00:07:38.918
Rejecting proposals
because they came from headquarters,

00:07:38.942 --> 00:07:41.958
or from a region
that we think is not like ours.

00:07:42.815 --> 00:07:44.082
But it is possible.

00:07:44.482 --> 00:07:48.823
When I work with teams,
trying to come up with the next big idea,

00:07:48.847 --> 00:07:51.371
or solve a really complex problem,

00:07:51.395 --> 00:07:56.850
I start by asking them, all of them,
to submit ideas anonymously.

00:07:57.355 --> 00:07:59.758
So by way of illustration, two years ago,

00:07:59.782 --> 00:08:02.474
I was working with multiple
government agencies

00:08:02.498 --> 00:08:06.416
to generate new solutions
to reduce long-term unemployment.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:08.507
Which is one of those really wicked,

00:08:08.531 --> 00:08:12.209
sticky, well-studied
public policy problems.

00:08:12.543 --> 00:08:15.117
So exactly as I described,
right at the beginning,

00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:18.541
potential solutions were captured
from everywhere.

00:08:18.942 --> 00:08:20.776
We aggregated them,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.434
each of them was produced
on an identical template.

00:08:23.458 --> 00:08:26.863
At this point, they all look the same,
they have no separate identity.

00:08:27.252 --> 00:08:30.990
And then, of course,
they are discussed, picked over,

00:08:31.014 --> 00:08:32.561
refined, finalized.

00:08:33.022 --> 00:08:36.775
And at the end of that process,
more than 20 of those new ideas

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:40.653
are presented to the cabinet ministers
responsible for consideration.

00:08:41.982 --> 00:08:47.506
But more than half of those,
the originator of those ideas

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:51.982
was someone who might have a hard time
getting the ear of a policy advisor.

00:08:52.006 --> 00:08:53.811
Or who, because of their identity,

00:08:53.835 --> 00:08:57.355
might not be taken
entirely seriously if they did.

00:08:57.379 --> 00:09:01.458
Folks who answer the phones,
assistants who manage calendars,

00:09:01.482 --> 00:09:05.349
representatives from agencies
who weren't always trusted.

00:09:07.371 --> 00:09:09.577
Imagine if our news media
did the same thing.

00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:13.289
You can kind of see it now --
a weekly cable news segment

00:09:13.313 --> 00:09:15.968
with a big policy proposal on the table

00:09:15.992 --> 00:09:19.392
that doesn't call it
liberal or conservative.

00:09:19.766 --> 00:09:25.101
Or a series of op-eds
for and against a big idea

00:09:25.125 --> 00:09:28.191
that don't tell you
where the writers worked.

00:09:28.703 --> 00:09:32.386
Our public conversations,
even our private disagreements,

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:38.018
can be transformed by debating ideas,
rather than discussing identity.

00:09:40.041 --> 00:09:43.669
And then, the thing that debate
allows us to do as human beings

00:09:43.693 --> 00:09:47.557
is open ourselves,
really open ourselves up

00:09:47.581 --> 00:09:50.581
to the possibility that we might be wrong.

00:09:50.605 --> 00:09:53.192
The humility of uncertainty.

00:09:54.375 --> 00:09:58.518
One of the reasons it is so hard
to disagree productively

00:09:58.542 --> 00:10:01.383
is because we become
attached to our ideas.

00:10:01.407 --> 00:10:07.216
We start to believe that we own them
and that by extension, they own us.

00:10:08.132 --> 00:10:11.156
But eventually, if you debate long enough,

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.466
you will switch sides,

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:16.220
you'll argue for and against
the expansion of the welfare state.

00:10:16.244 --> 00:10:18.511
For and against compulsory voting.

00:10:19.331 --> 00:10:23.696
And that exercise
flips a kind of cognitive switch.

00:10:24.231 --> 00:10:26.490
The suspicions that you hold

00:10:26.514 --> 00:10:31.490
about people who espouse beliefs
that you don't have, starts to evaporate.

00:10:31.514 --> 00:10:35.164
Because you can imagine yourself
stepping into those shoes.

00:10:35.188 --> 00:10:37.768
And as you're stepping into those,

00:10:37.792 --> 00:10:40.362
you're embracing
the humility of uncertainty.

00:10:40.386 --> 00:10:42.453
The possibility of being wrong.

00:10:43.411 --> 00:10:48.037
And it's that exact humility
that makes us better decision-makers.

00:10:48.061 --> 00:10:53.331
Neuroscientist and psychologist Mark Leary
at Duke University and his colleagues

00:10:53.355 --> 00:10:55.736
have found that people
who are able to practice --

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.196
and it is a skill --

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.514
what those researchers call
intellectual humility

00:11:00.538 --> 00:11:04.339
are more capable of evaluating
a broad range of evidence,

00:11:04.363 --> 00:11:06.616
are more objective when they do so,

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.315
and become less defensive
when confronted with conflicting evidence.

00:11:11.339 --> 00:11:14.549
All attributes that we want in our bosses,

00:11:14.573 --> 00:11:17.736
colleagues, discussion partners,
decision-makers,

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.427
all virtues that we would like
to claim for ourselves.

00:11:22.688 --> 00:11:26.252
And so, as we're embracing
that humility of uncertainty,

00:11:26.276 --> 00:11:30.123
we should be asking each other,
all of us, a question.

00:11:30.696 --> 00:11:34.125
Our debate moderators, our news anchors
should be asking it

00:11:34.149 --> 00:11:37.341
of our elective representatives
and candidates for office, too.

00:11:38.355 --> 00:11:43.171
"What is it that you have changed
your mind about and why?"

00:11:44.982 --> 00:11:48.912
"What uncertainty are you humble about?"

00:11:50.221 --> 00:11:52.251
And this by the way, isn't some fantasy

00:11:52.275 --> 00:11:56.150
about how public life
and public conversations could work.

00:11:56.174 --> 00:11:57.499
It has precedent.

00:11:57.982 --> 00:11:59.816
So, in 1969,

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.452
beloved American children's
television presenter Mister Rogers

00:12:03.476 --> 00:12:04.979
sits impaneled

00:12:05.003 --> 00:12:08.966
before the United States congressional
subcommittee on communications,

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:13.216
chaired by the seemingly very
curmudgeonly John Pastore.

00:12:13.651 --> 00:12:16.786
And Mister Rogers is there
to make a kind of classic debate case,

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.690
a really bold proposal:

00:12:18.714 --> 00:12:22.635
an increase in federal funding
for public broadcasting.

00:12:23.815 --> 00:12:25.006
And at the outset,

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.791
committee disciplinarian
Senator Pastore is not having it.

00:12:27.815 --> 00:12:30.863
This is about to end
really poorly for Mister Rogers.

00:12:31.792 --> 00:12:37.180
But patiently, very reasonably,
Mister Rogers makes the case

00:12:37.204 --> 00:12:40.593
why good quality children's broadcasting,

00:12:40.617 --> 00:12:44.950
the kinds of television programs
that talk about the drama that arises

00:12:44.974 --> 00:12:47.315
in the most ordinary of families,

00:12:47.339 --> 00:12:49.228
matters to all of us.

00:12:49.252 --> 00:12:51.458
Even while it costs us.

00:12:51.927 --> 00:12:54.807
He invites us into a shared reality.

00:12:55.593 --> 00:12:57.531
And on the other side of that table,

00:12:57.555 --> 00:13:04.261
Senator Pastore listens,
engages and opens his mind.

00:13:05.333 --> 00:13:09.560
Out loud, in public, on the record.

00:13:10.604 --> 00:13:13.373
And Senator Pastore
says to Mister Rogers,

00:13:13.397 --> 00:13:15.889
"You know, I'm supposed to be
a pretty tough guy,

00:13:15.913 --> 00:13:19.640
and this is the first time
I've had goosebumps in two days."

00:13:19.664 --> 00:13:25.223
And then, later, "It looks like you
just earned the 20 million dollars."

00:13:26.307 --> 00:13:29.815
We need many more Mister Rogers.

00:13:29.839 --> 00:13:33.187
People with the technical skills
of debate and persuasion.

00:13:33.768 --> 00:13:35.728
But on the other side of that table,

00:13:35.752 --> 00:13:40.957
we need many, many,
many more Senator Pastores.

00:13:41.585 --> 00:13:45.410
And the magic of debate
is that it lets you, it empowers you

00:13:45.434 --> 00:13:50.778
to be both Mister Rogers
and Senator Pastore simultaneously.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.958
When I work with those same teams
that we talked about before,

00:13:54.982 --> 00:13:59.842
I ask them at the outset to pre-commit
to the possibility of being wrong.

00:14:00.323 --> 00:14:05.347
To explain to me and to each other
what it would take to change their minds.

00:14:05.782 --> 00:14:08.964
And that's all about the attitude,
not the exercise.

00:14:09.655 --> 00:14:12.932
Once you start thinking about
what it would take to change your mind,

00:14:12.956 --> 00:14:17.249
you start to wonder why
you were quite so sure in the first place.

00:14:17.996 --> 00:14:21.648
There is so much
that the practice of debate

00:14:21.672 --> 00:14:24.585
has to offer us
for how to disagree productively.

00:14:24.894 --> 00:14:27.069
And we should bring it to our workplaces,

00:14:27.093 --> 00:14:29.561
our conferences,
our city council meetings.

00:14:30.085 --> 00:14:35.267
And the principles of debate can transform
the way that we talk to one another,

00:14:35.815 --> 00:14:40.060
to empower us to stop talking
and to start listening.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:43.753
To stop dismissing
and to start persuading.

00:14:44.156 --> 00:14:48.235
To stop shutting down
and to start opening our minds.

00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:49.981
Thank you so much.

00:14:50.005 --> 00:14:55.000
(Applause)
