00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.835
So now that I was 4,000 dollars
in the hole, I did two things.

00:04:25.859 --> 00:04:28.413
The first is that I unlinked
my credit card

00:04:28.437 --> 00:04:29.902
from my car-sharing apps.

00:04:29.926 --> 00:04:34.022
Instead, I linked a debit card
that only had 300 dollars a month.

00:04:34.046 --> 00:04:35.244
If I needed more,

00:04:35.268 --> 00:04:38.118
I had to go through the whole process
of adding a new card,

00:04:38.142 --> 00:04:42.594
and we know that every click,
every barrier, changes our behavior.

00:00:00.165 --> 00:00:01.924
We all know that saving is important

00:00:01.948 --> 00:00:03.942
and is something that we should be doing.

00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:06.323
And yet, overall, we're doing
less and less of it.

00:00:06.347 --> 00:00:08.949
[The Way We Work]

00:00:10.622 --> 00:00:12.209
We know what we need to do.

00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:14.368
The question is: How do we do it?

00:00:14.392 --> 00:00:16.218
And that's what I'm here to teach you.

00:00:16.242 --> 00:00:19.075
Your savings behavior
isn't a question of how smart you are

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:20.609
or how much willpower you have.

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:23.910
The amount we save depends
on the environmental cues around us.

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:25.347
Let me give you an example.

00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:27.879
We ran a study in which, in one group,

00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:30.799
we showed people
their income on a monthly basis.

00:00:30.823 --> 00:00:34.466
In another group, we showed people
their income on a weekly basis.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.776
And what we found was that people
who saw their income on a weekly basis

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.172
were able to budget better
throughout the month.

00:00:41.196 --> 00:00:42.496
Now, it's important to know

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.297
that we didn't change
how much money people were receiving,

00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:48.635
we just changed the environment
in which they understood their income.

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.104
And environmental cues
like this have an impact.

00:00:51.128 --> 00:00:54.136
So I'm not going to share tricks with you
that you already know.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.922
I'm not going to tell you
how to open up a savings account

00:00:56.946 --> 00:00:58.958
or how to start saving
for your retirement.

00:00:58.982 --> 00:01:01.867
What I am going to share with you
is how to bridge this gap

00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:03.704
from your intentions to save

00:01:03.728 --> 00:01:05.022
and your actions.

00:01:05.046 --> 00:01:06.227
Are you ready?

00:01:06.251 --> 00:01:07.442
Here's number one:

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.213
harness the power of pre-commitment.

00:01:09.237 --> 00:01:12.260
Fundamentally, we think about ourselves
in two different ways:

00:01:12.284 --> 00:01:14.745
our present self and our future self.

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:16.420
In the future, we're perfect.

00:01:16.444 --> 00:01:18.800
In the future, we're going to
save for retirement,

00:01:18.824 --> 00:01:20.119
we're going to lose weight,

00:01:20.143 --> 00:01:21.936
we're going to call our parents more.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.085
But we oftentimes forget
that our future self

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.149
is exactly the same person
as our present self.

00:01:27.173 --> 00:01:30.752
We know that one of the best times to save
is when you get your tax return.

00:01:30.776 --> 00:01:32.410
So we tried an A/B test.

00:01:32.434 --> 00:01:35.823
In the first group, we texted people
in early February,

00:01:35.847 --> 00:01:38.299
hopefully before
they even filed for their taxes.

00:01:38.323 --> 00:01:39.482
And we asked them,

00:01:39.506 --> 00:01:42.843
"If you get a tax refund,
what percentage would you like to save?"

00:01:42.867 --> 00:01:44.565
Now this is a really hard question.

00:01:44.589 --> 00:01:48.165
They didn't know if they would
receive a tax refund or how much.

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:49.882
But we asked the question anyway.

00:01:49.906 --> 00:01:54.095
In the second group, we asked people
right after they received their refund,

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.095
"What percentage would you like to save?"

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.413
Now, here's what happened.

00:01:57.437 --> 00:02:01.372
In that second condition, when people
just received their tax refund,

00:02:01.396 --> 00:02:04.517
they wanted to save about 17 percent
of their tax refund.

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:09.057
But in the condition when we asked people
before they even filed their taxes,

00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:13.534
savings rates increased
from 17 percent to 27 percent

00:02:13.558 --> 00:02:14.936
when we asked in February.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.130
Why?

00:02:16.154 --> 00:02:18.370
Because you're committing
for your future self,

00:02:18.394 --> 00:02:21.093
and of course your future self
can save 27 percent.

00:02:21.117 --> 00:02:23.720
These large changes in savings behavior

00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:26.903
came from the fact that we changed
the decision-making environment.

00:02:26.927 --> 00:02:29.346
We want you to be able
to harness that same power.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.630
So take a moment

00:02:30.654 --> 00:02:34.069
and think about the ways in which
you can sign up your future self

00:02:34.093 --> 00:02:37.069
for something that you know today
will be a little bit hard.

00:02:37.093 --> 00:02:40.752
Sign up for an app that lets you
make savings decisions in advance.

00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:43.982
The trick is, you have to have
that binding contract.

00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:47.608
Number two: use transition moments
to your advantage.

00:02:47.632 --> 00:02:49.516
We did an experiment with a website

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.061
that helps older adults
share their housing.

00:02:52.085 --> 00:02:54.037
We ran two ads on social media,

00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:56.903
targeted to the same
population of 64-year-olds.

00:02:56.927 --> 00:02:59.968
In one group, we said,
"Hey, you're getting older.

00:02:59.992 --> 00:03:01.426
Are you ready for retirement?

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.633
House sharing can help."

00:03:02.657 --> 00:03:05.473
In the second group,
we got a little bit more specific

00:03:05.497 --> 00:03:07.879
and said, "You're 64 turning 65.

00:03:07.903 --> 00:03:09.328
Are you ready for retirement?

00:03:09.352 --> 00:03:10.680
House sharing can help."

00:03:10.704 --> 00:03:12.545
What we're doing in that second group

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.061
is highlighting that
a transition is happening.

00:03:15.085 --> 00:03:16.236
All of a sudden,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.382
we saw click-through rates,
and ultimately sign-up rates, increase

00:03:19.406 --> 00:03:20.566
when we highlight that.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.307
In psychology, we call this
the "fresh start effect."

00:03:23.331 --> 00:03:26.506
Whether it's the start of a new year
or even a new season,

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.964
your motivation to act increases.

00:03:28.988 --> 00:03:31.537
So right now, put a meeting
request on your calendar

00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:33.442
for the day before your next birthday.

00:03:33.466 --> 00:03:36.558
Identify the one financial thing
you most want to do.

00:03:36.863 --> 00:03:38.756
And commit yourself to it.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.497
The third and final trick:

00:03:40.521 --> 00:03:43.712
get a handle on small, frequent purchases.

00:03:43.736 --> 00:03:45.768
We've run a few different studies

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:50.379
and found that the number one purchase
people say they regret, after bank fees,

00:03:50.403 --> 00:03:51.553
is eating out.

00:03:51.577 --> 00:03:54.355
It's a frequent purchase
we make almost every day,

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.550
and it's death by a thousand cuts.

00:03:56.574 --> 00:03:58.933
A coffee here, a burrito there ...

00:03:58.957 --> 00:04:01.803
It adds up and decreases
our ability to save.

00:04:02.513 --> 00:04:04.244
Back when I lived in New York City,

00:04:04.268 --> 00:04:05.649
I looked at my expenses

00:04:05.673 --> 00:04:09.863
and saw that I spent over 2,000 dollars
on ride-sharing apps.

00:04:09.887 --> 00:04:11.902
It was more than my New York City rent.

00:04:11.926 --> 00:04:13.728
I vowed to make a change.

00:04:13.752 --> 00:04:16.714
And the next month,
I spent 2,000 dollars again --

00:04:16.738 --> 00:04:20.553
no change, because the information
alone didn't change my behavior.

00:04:20.577 --> 00:04:22.276
I didn't change my environment.

00:04:42.618 --> 00:04:43.888
We aren't machines.

00:04:43.912 --> 00:04:46.364
We don't carry around an abacus every day,

00:04:46.388 --> 00:04:50.074
adding up what we're spending,
in comparison to what we wanted.

00:04:50.098 --> 00:04:52.352
But what our brains are very good at

00:04:52.376 --> 00:04:55.527
is counting up the number of times
we've done something.

00:04:55.551 --> 00:04:57.336
So I gave myself a limit.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.918
I can only use ride-sharing apps
three times a week.

00:05:00.942 --> 00:05:03.656
It forced me to ration my travels.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.338
I got a handle on my car-sharing expenses
to the benefit of my husband,

00:05:07.362 --> 00:05:09.609
because of the environmental
changes that I did.

00:05:09.633 --> 00:05:12.505
So get a handle on whatever
that purchase is for you,

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:15.502
and change your environment
to make it harder to do so.

00:05:15.895 --> 00:05:17.696
Those are my tips for you.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.855
But I want you to remember one thing.

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:23.806
As human beings, we can be irrational
when it comes to saving

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.704
and spending and budgeting.

00:05:25.728 --> 00:05:27.974
But luckily, we know this about ourselves,

00:05:27.998 --> 00:05:31.617
and we can predict how we'll act
under certain environments.

00:05:31.641 --> 00:05:33.426
Let's do that with saving.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.554
Let's change our environment
to help our future selves.
