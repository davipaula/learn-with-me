00:00:00.222 --> 00:00:01.506
We think of a great leader

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.446
as the unwavering captain
who guides us forward

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.336
through challenge and complexity.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.786
Confident, unwavering leaders,

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.201
armed with data and past experience

00:00:11.225 --> 00:00:14.908
have long been celebrated
in business and politics alike.

00:00:14.932 --> 00:00:17.138
But sometimes and certainly now,

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:20.289
a crisis comes along
that is so new and so urgent

00:00:20.313 --> 00:00:22.607
that it upends everything
we thought we knew.

00:00:22.631 --> 00:00:24.857
[The Way We Work]

[Made possible with 
the support of Dropbox]

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.518
One thing we know for sure

00:00:28.542 --> 00:00:30.327
is that more upheavals are coming.

00:00:30.351 --> 00:00:32.516
In a completely interconnected world

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.628
a single political uprising,

00:00:34.652 --> 00:00:37.716
a viral video, a distant tsunami,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.033
or a tiny virus can send
shock waves around the world.

00:00:42.057 --> 00:00:43.827
Upheaval creates fear,

00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:46.374
and in the midst of it
people crave security,

00:00:46.398 --> 00:00:47.797
which can incline leaders

00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:53.299
toward the usual tropes of strength,
confidence, constancy,

00:00:53.323 --> 00:00:54.481
but it won't work.

00:00:54.505 --> 00:00:56.530
We have to flip the leadership playbook.

00:00:56.554 --> 00:00:58.998
First, this type of leadership requires

00:00:59.022 --> 00:01:02.657
communicating with transparency,
communicating often.

00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:05.703
So how can leaders lead
when there is so little certainty,

00:01:05.727 --> 00:01:07.339
so little clarity?

00:01:07.363 --> 00:01:11.315
Whether you are a CEO,
a prime minister, a middle manager

00:01:11.339 --> 00:01:12.870
or even a head of school,

00:01:12.894 --> 00:01:15.866
upheaval means you have
to ramp up the humility.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.376
When what you know is limited,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.335
pretending that you have
the answers isn't helpful.

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:24.041
Amidst upheaval, leaders
must share what they know

00:01:24.065 --> 00:01:25.946
and admit what they don't know.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.431
Paradoxically, that honesty creates
more psychological safety for people,

00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:31.638
not less.

00:01:31.662 --> 00:01:35.543
For example when the pandemic
devastated the airline industry

00:01:35.567 --> 00:01:36.725
virtually overnight,

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:38.971
CEO of Delta Airlines Ed Bastian

00:01:38.995 --> 00:01:41.311
ramped up employee communication

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:43.186
despite having so little clarity

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.813
about the path ahead,
facing truly dire results.

00:01:46.837 --> 00:01:48.241
At one point in 2020,

00:01:48.265 --> 00:01:50.931
losing over a hundred
million dollars a day,

00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:52.930
it would have been far easier for Bastian

00:01:52.954 --> 00:01:56.058
to wait for more information
before taking action,

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:58.201
but effective leaders during upheaval

00:01:58.225 --> 00:01:59.846
don't hide in the shadows.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.522
In fact, as Bastian put it,

00:02:01.546 --> 00:02:03.887
it is far more important to communicate

00:02:03.911 --> 00:02:06.665
when you don't have the answers
than when you do.

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.760
Second, act with urgency
despite incomplete information.

00:02:10.784 --> 00:02:12.785
Admitting you don't have the answers

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.158
does not mean avoiding action.

00:02:15.182 --> 00:02:18.016
While it's natural to want
more information,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.618
fast action is often the only way
to get more information.

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:25.188
Worse, inaction leaves people
feeling lost and unstable.

00:02:25.212 --> 00:02:27.979
When New Zealand
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern

00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:31.069
laid out a four level
alert system very early

00:02:31.093 --> 00:02:32.672
in the COVID-19 crisis,

00:02:32.696 --> 00:02:35.617
she lacked information
with which to set the level.

00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:39.501
Despite lacking answers,
she did not wait to communicate

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:41.204
about the threat with the nation.

00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:43.421
At first she set the level at two,

00:02:43.445 --> 00:02:47.478
only to change it to four
two days later as cases rose.

00:02:47.502 --> 00:02:50.089
That triggered a national lockdown,

00:02:50.113 --> 00:02:52.854
which no doubt saved countless lives.

00:02:52.878 --> 00:02:55.819
Later, when cases began to dissipate,

00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:57.740
she made subsequent decisions

00:02:57.764 --> 00:02:59.826
reflecting that new information.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.186
Third, leaders must hold
purpose and values steady,

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.654
even as goals and situations change.

00:03:05.678 --> 00:03:07.440
Values can be your guiding light

00:03:07.464 --> 00:03:09.427
when everything else is up in the air.

00:03:09.451 --> 00:03:11.316
If you care about customer experience,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.841
don't let go of that in times of upheaval.

00:03:13.865 --> 00:03:16.480
If a core value is health and safety,

00:03:16.504 --> 00:03:19.465
put that at the center
of every decision you make.

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.322
Now doing this requires
being very transparent

00:03:22.346 --> 00:03:23.987
about what your values are,

00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:26.879
and in this way, your steadfastness shows

00:03:26.903 --> 00:03:29.534
not in your plans but in your values.

00:03:29.558 --> 00:03:32.616
Prime Minister Ardern's
clear purpose all along

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.189
was protecting human life.

00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:37.967
Even as the immediate goal
shifted from preventing illness

00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:39.610
to preparing health systems

00:03:39.634 --> 00:03:42.038
and ultimately to bolstering the economy.

00:03:42.062 --> 00:03:44.583
And finally, give power away.

00:03:44.607 --> 00:03:47.164
Our instincts are to hold
even more tightly

00:03:47.188 --> 00:03:50.368
to control in times of upheaval,
but it backfires.

00:03:50.392 --> 00:03:53.426
One of the most effective
ways to show leadership,

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.943
if counterintuitive,

00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:57.442
is to share power with those around you.

00:03:57.466 --> 00:03:59.793
Doing this requires asking for help,

00:03:59.817 --> 00:04:02.127
being clear that you can't do it alone.

00:04:02.151 --> 00:04:04.206
This also provokes innovation

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.094
while giving people a sense of meaning.

00:04:06.118 --> 00:04:08.095
Nothing is worse in a crisis

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:10.816
than feeling like there's
nothing you can do to help.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.158
We follow this new kind
of leader through upheaval,

00:04:14.182 --> 00:04:15.976
because we have confidence

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.331
not in their map but in their compass.

00:04:19.355 --> 00:04:21.831
We believe they've chosen
the right direction

00:04:21.855 --> 00:04:23.807
given the current information,

00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:25.760
and that they will keep updating.

00:04:25.784 --> 00:04:28.339
Most of all, we trust them

00:04:28.363 --> 00:04:32.374
and we want to help them
in finding and refinding

00:04:32.398 --> 00:04:33.658
the path forward.
