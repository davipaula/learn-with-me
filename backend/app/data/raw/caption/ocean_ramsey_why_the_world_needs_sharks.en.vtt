00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.940
What if we were to redefine
the relationship we have with sharks,

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.470
to one based on scientific fact,
reality, and logic,

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.640
rather than the current one, based off of
limited and biased information?

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.100
I want to talk about how changing the way
we perceive sharks and interact with them

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.880
could change our environment, economies,
and lives for the better.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.385
But first, I want
to introduce you to someone

00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:57.000
who has positively influenced and inspired
my life's work, passion, and focus.

00:00:57.262 --> 00:01:02.210
She's intelligent, she's graceful,
beautiful, efficient,

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.000
but what I admire her most for
is her very important work and role.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.040
What most people don't know
is that without her work and influence,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.800
none of our lives would be the same.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.280
And I wanted to describe her to you first,
before I showed you her photo,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.410
because I've come to find that,
oftentimes, we make snap judgments,

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.380
prejudice, based off of
very little factual information.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.640
I've personally found this
because oftentimes I'm judged solely

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.320
off of my appearance
or work as a professional model,

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.290
rather than my primary work
in science, conservation, and business.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.110
So, please keep in mind the truth

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.971
that often there's more 
than meets the eye,

00:01:42.971 --> 00:01:45.121
and when you take time
to get to know someone

00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:46.430
and better understand them,

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.970
maybe you can better value them.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.025
And sometimes it's a little more
interesting than you think too.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.390
So, without further ado,
my beautiful role model, Bella,

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.600
which means beautiful,

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.590
and yes, she's a great white shark,
or more accurately termed, a white shark,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.580
Carcharodon carcharias.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.138
Now, I know you might just be
noticing her nice teeth

00:02:05.138 --> 00:02:07.651
and thinking something along
the lines of "monster,"

00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:10.449
but tonight, put your prior beliefs
about sharks on hold,

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.810
while I explain why Bella
is an ideal role model,

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.590
why we should seriously take action

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.620
to redefine the relationship
we have with these animals,

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.160
to one based on scientific fact,

00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:20.490
to that or reality,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.880
rather than appearances, snap judgments,
and fictitious Hollywood movies.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.410
Bella and her kind
are extremely intelligent.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.280
I've observed her, and her kind,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.700
outsmarting even humans
within a matter of moments

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.270
by adapting her behavior
even in novel situations.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.590
This ability to quickly adapt

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.950
has likely led to sharks'
resilience over time.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.680
They evolved before dinosaurs,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.080
before trees.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.530
They evolved two more known
sensory systems than we even have

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.720
to aid them a high level of efficiency

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.130
in their very important role
in the ecosystems,

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.300
shaping, influencing them,
and making them stronger, and better.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.600
Now, even though they are
highly cognitive, cautious,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.350
and take in multiple factors
before they take action,

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.980
it is true that on rare, rare, rare,
much more rare, occasions

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.340
than we make mistakes,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.490
sharks do make mistakes, and,
unfortunately, someone does get bit.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.510
Still, considering the millions of people

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.570
that enter the water,
the oceans, every single day,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.710
and the average number
of fatalities is five to seven ...

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.520
Now, I feel extremely lucky.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.940
I get to spend almost every single day
diving with sharks,

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.223
over 30 different species around the world

00:03:37.223 --> 00:03:40.940
on a diversity of research programs
and conservation campaigns.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.642
My work in marine biology
focuses on ethology,

00:03:43.642 --> 00:03:47.480
which is animal behavior and psychology,
and cognitive ecology,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.490
where I study the way the animals interact
with one another and their environment.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.180
I've come to observe and learn
some of the most fascinating things

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.770
I wish I had more time
to share with you tonight.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.390
But in my limited time with you,

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.420
what I've come to appreciate,

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.460
what I feel is most important and urgent,

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.705
and if I could speak up for sharks,
what I'd want to share with you,

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:12.510
is their very important role and work,
and how it affects all of our lives.

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.646
Essentially, imagine sharks
as the ocean's immune system,

00:04:19.646 --> 00:04:20.887
the white blood cells.

00:04:20.887 --> 00:04:23.680
They pick up the dead, dying,
weak, sick, injured animals,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.650
leaving only the healthiest to reproduce,

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.160
keeping lower trophic levels
and populations in balance.

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.370
We all rely on our immune systems,

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.050
and the scientific evidence
for the importance of sharks is mounting.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.190
There are so many studies

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.810
that show one after the other

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.530
that the removal of sharks

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.610
has environmental and economic
negative impacts -

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.250
Ransom A Myers, Bascompete -

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.400
effects all the way down
to coral reef systems.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.580
The removal of sharks has been
attributed with starvation.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.690
Throughout the respected
scientific community,

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.780
there's no denying
the importance of sharks,

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.470
their effects on our environments,

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.670
our economies,

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.390
even the air that we breathe.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.030
70-80% of the air
we rely on to continue living

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.730
comes from our oceans.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.530
Either directly or indirectly,
we all rely on the oceans.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.346
Billions rely on it for seafood,

00:05:17.346 --> 00:05:21.200
over 200 million rely on it
for direct employments.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.570
Our lives, our futures,
are interconnected.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.090
In the words of one
of my human role models,

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.982
the wonderful Dr Sylvia Earle,

00:05:28.982 --> 00:05:32.272
"With every drop of water that you drink,
every breath that you take,

00:05:32.272 --> 00:05:33.614
you're connected to the sea.

00:05:33.614 --> 00:05:36.510
No matter where on the planet you live."

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.270
But sharks are still scary, right?

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.700
So that's kind of the problem.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.420
Most peoples don't know
many factual things about sharks,

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.691
except they have teeth,

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.060
and many more people don't know

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.042
that sharks are actually being
decimated, globally,

00:05:51.042 --> 00:05:55.866
at a rate of over 11,000
every single hour.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.365
That's more than three sharks
every single second.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.020
That translates to 70-100 million
sharks killed every year.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.280
That's like killing everyone in Spain,
Austria and France every single year.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:13.230
Now, according to fishing records,
over 90% of sharks have been depleted.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.900
According to the International Union
for Conservation of Nature,

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.887
over a third of all large sharks
have been wiped out,

00:06:21.887 --> 00:06:24.651
or are facing extinction,
or are vulnerable to extinction.

00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:29.450
So, why such a mass slaughter
of such an important and keystone species?

00:06:29.662 --> 00:06:34.160
Well, some of it is due to silly things
like souvenirs and pharmaceuticals.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.550
Some of it is due to men
and their inferiority complexes ...

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:39.750
I'm guessing.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.040
(Laughter)

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.984
(Applause)

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:52.820
80% of long-lining is bycatch,
and most of it is sharks.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:59.361
Culling, which is probably this least
intelligent reaction a country can have

00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:01.590
to an adverse shark-human interaction;

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.830
basically, like shooting
yourself in the foot,

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.711
from a behavioral standpoint,

00:07:05.717 --> 00:07:08.136
also a waste and indiscriminate killer.

00:07:08.193 --> 00:07:11.733
But the number one killer
of sharks, globally:

00:07:12.868 --> 00:07:14.360
a bowl of soup.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.839
Yes, we are trading
the health and productivity

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:26.798
of our oceans-reliant environment
and economies for a bowl of soup.

00:07:27.971 --> 00:07:32.410
What's worse, it's not even nutritious;
it's actually toxic.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.420
It's merely for the Chinese culture belief

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.910
that when they serve that soup,

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.690
it means that they're
prestigious or important.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:42.360
But what is classy about catching a shark,

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.047
hacking off its fins,
oftentimes while it's still alive,

00:07:45.047 --> 00:07:46.500
wasting 95% of the animal

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.840
just to make yourself feel better
about your social status.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.020
Consider: sharks have been evolving
for over 400 million years;

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.590
humans, 200,000,
and their culturals, far less.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.430
We can live without culture,
but not without our oceans,

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.470
and our oceans cannot live
without their immune systems.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:07.190
Like rhinos killed just for their horns,
and elephants killed just for their tusks,

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:12.380
sharks are being killed, slaughtered,
globally, just for their fins.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.800
Now, I love traveling the world

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.980
and experiencing
the diversity of cultures,

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.583
but there has to be a point

00:08:18.583 --> 00:08:21.740
when we re-evaluate the relationship

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.550
that we have with sharks and animals,

00:08:24.565 --> 00:08:29.820
and look at how our cultures
can adapt and evolve honorably.

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.351
An ancient Chinese proverb says

00:08:31.362 --> 00:08:35.400
when you do not change your direction,
you may end up where you are heading.

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.730
So what if we were to adopt this idea

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.419
and change the way
we interact with sharks?

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:42.740
What would that look like?

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:45.500
Well, the great news is
we already have concrete examples,

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:50.350
places like Palau, Bahamas,
areas like Cabo Pulmo, and Palmyra.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:51.692
In those areas,

00:08:51.692 --> 00:08:54.033
reef and fish stocks are thriving.

00:08:54.191 --> 00:09:01.190
Ecotourism is bringing in
over US $314 million to local economies,

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.710
directly employing over 10,000 jobs.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.050
This study by Dr Michele Barnes
and the University of British Columbia

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.894
is actually showing that that number
will increase, more than double,

00:09:10.894 --> 00:09:12.202
in less than 20 years.

00:09:12.202 --> 00:09:14.456
So $780 million,

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:18.290
far outweighing the global fin trade.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.834
So put at the most basic terms,
even on just the monetary level,

00:09:21.888 --> 00:09:24.210
which is usually
what politicians care about,

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.779
a live shark is worth more
than a dead shark.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.454
And what's great is,
these shark ecotourism programs,

00:09:30.454 --> 00:09:31.950
they can support research.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.010
I was working out with Dr Mauricio Hoyos,

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.770
we were tagging, taking biopsies,

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:36.790
and I was wondering:

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.908
Is any of this conservation-based research

00:09:38.908 --> 00:09:40.258
going to make a difference

00:09:40.258 --> 00:09:42.810
before these guys are
just wiped out off the planet?

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.590
Then one day, 20 meters underwater,

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.550
doing a population count
surrounded by these beautiful sharks,

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:52.040
I was realizing by the time I gather,
process and publish my studies,

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.310
another 3-6 million sharks will be killed.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:57.820
So why study something that's being
eradicated the rate the sharks are

00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:59.230
and not do anything about it.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.090
So I opened my research to the public.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.700
I developed a program,

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.890
where people could come to learn about
sharks from a scientific perspective.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:11.550
I collaborated with @juansharks,

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:14.820
who is a well-known
shark and marine photographer

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.170
and shark specialist.

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:20.080
We developed this program
that's research- and conservation-based,

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.420
and opened it to the public

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.470
so they could learn about
their biology, physiology, behavior,

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.100
how to interact with them safely,

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.030
answers all those questions
people don't know about sharks.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.130
The cool thing is people actually
get to get in the water with us

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.370
and see for themselves, eye to eye,
what sharks are really like.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:37.027
It's such a successful program

00:10:37.027 --> 00:10:40.039
as people can speak up for sharks
from a first-hand perspective

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:43.970
and also influence their networks,
and change people's minds.

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.920
We are also able to fund
educational outreach through this,

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.670
reef and beach cleanups,
local conservation campaigns,

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:52.090
and international conservation campaigns,

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.750
like stopping the cull
in Western Australia,

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.330
a story for another time

00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:00.590
I'm honestly rather glad I don't have time
to share tonight as I'd end up crying.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:06.890
But we were able to save
one of the juvenile sharks.

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:10.140
She was under three meters,
and she would have just died,

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.840
even though she was
cattle tagged improperly,

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:17.340
and, you know, for 90 minutes,
I swam with her, looking her in the eye,

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.020
and trying to tell her
it was going to be okay

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.840
as blood was spilling out of her head,

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.700
and kind of trying to tell myself
it was going to be okay.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.180
After 90 minutes, she swam off:
and it was that effort.

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:31.470
This is another conservation campaign,
a little better known.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.890
It reached over 2 million people in 2 days

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:38.190
and featured none other
than the lovely role model, Bella,

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:42.050
who is so great for her species,
a great representative.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:43.840
At the time when we released it,

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.110
it was because there was a study put out

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.510
showing there were less
than 350 great whites,

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:51.570
in the area from California to Alaska
to Hawaii to Mexico,

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.480
an area where juansharks and I
grew up diving with sharks,

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.150
with white sharks specifically.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.640
We knew many of them,
had spent much time with them,

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.430
studying behavior, working with them.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.260
So what do you do when you hear
someone you love, care about, understand,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.560
is being eradicated?

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.610
Something.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.690
So, we thought, with Water Inspired

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.560
we'd try and use inspiring photography
and videography to inspire people to care.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.960
We needed people to give white sharks
a second look, a second chance.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.680
They don't make the news very often.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.490
When they do, I'm sure you guys all know,
it's not usually good press.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.070
So we were successful.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:27.700
We wanted to show
the natural beauty of sharks.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.570
But most often, when people see
a beautiful image like this,

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.800
they just think it's just on its way
to eat the next person, right?

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.080
So, we want to do the anti-Jaws.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.370
The little blond girl, she gets eaten
in the fictitious movie, right?

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.080
So what's it like in reality?

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.490
Well, I've been working with them
for a long time, right?

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:47.240
We dive to get receivers
and other things like that,

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.135
so I wanted to show a connection,

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:52.631
I wanted people to be able to connect,
see another side of these animals,

00:12:52.631 --> 00:12:54.631
realize that we can coexist.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:59.270
But in order to coexist,
they have to exist,

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:03.860
and there's so much more
to these animals than meets the eye.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.510
When you take the time
to get to know somebody,

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:10.880
you know, you can understand
that maybe there's more to them.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.310
And so I wanted
to share that with the world.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.830
And I have to give the disclaimer -

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.650
I mean, there's just so many things that
I would love to share with you guys --

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.576
but I do have to give the disclaimer

00:13:22.576 --> 00:13:27.597
that they deserve
a lot of respect ... not fear,

00:13:27.597 --> 00:13:30.352
but they are apex predators,
they do have a role ...

00:13:30.352 --> 00:13:32.292
and we need them for that role,

00:13:32.292 --> 00:13:33.750
it's very important.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.420
I mean, I could cite study
after study after study,

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.230
showing the importance of that.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:43.540
You know, if I wanted to go out
into the African savanna and pat a lion,

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:44.770
you know what I would do?

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:48.250
I would call up the lion whisperer,
and I'd go hang out with him,

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.417
and I'd learn, and I'd study from him,

00:13:50.417 --> 00:13:53.424
out of respect for the animal
because of its reputation.

00:13:53.582 --> 00:13:55.417
So, while I understand that,

00:13:55.417 --> 00:13:58.530
especially the way that they are
portrayed in the media,

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.520
that people are afraid of them,

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.163
you shouldn't be afraid of them;

00:14:02.163 --> 00:14:04.425
you should just respect them.

00:14:04.425 --> 00:14:07.440
they are beautiful animals,
there's so much more to them.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.810
So if there's one thing
that Bella has taught me,

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.350
it's that, like Bella,

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:15.850
we can all positively change and influence
our environments for the better.

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:19.020
All we need to do is take action.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.569
In the words of Jane Goodall:

00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:21.990
Every day we make an impact.

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:26.347
It's up to us what kind of an impact
we want that to be.

00:14:27.464 --> 00:14:30.434
Now, this was just one successful
collaborative program

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:32.230
that we collaborated with GoPro on.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.690
They were very true to the message
and released a beautiful piece,

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:39.550
but there are so many other things,
other media pieces we could do,

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:43.520
even just writing to a restaurant,
asking them not to serve shark fin soup.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.600
New campaigns, political policies,
the ideas are endless.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.000
What it comes down to is:

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.070
Yeah, knowledge is powerful,
but it's nothing without action.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.280
I love Nike.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.090
I get up every morning and go running.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.300
It's like, just do it.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.450
You may not feel like it,
but any effort is better than no effort.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.500
[We may feel like what we are doing
is just a drop in the ocean,

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.740
but the ocean would be less
without that drop.]

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.820
So I want to ask you guys tonight,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.850
(Laughter)

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:12.410
to take action for your future.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.690
Sharks and the oceans affect us all.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.480
I'd like to see a raise of hands

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:22.800
for all those that are willing to take
a small, small action for a better future.

00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.300
Raise your hands if you are
willing to take that action.

00:15:26.366 --> 00:15:27.760
Oh, I so see all those hands.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.580
Okay, I'm going to call you out on it.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.780
I want you guys to use that hand
and grab your phones.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:33.880
I'll do it with you.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.890
Grab your phones.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:37.700
I know it's usually rude to grab
your phones during a talk,

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.330
but you'll be helping me.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.490
This is really good. This is good.
This is your call to action.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.080
Let's do it!
(Laughter)

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.490
So I want you guys to grab your phone,

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:51.090
and we're going to spread
great ideas globally.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:55.900
I want you guys to Tweet,
Facebook, Instagram, something.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.871
Spread an idea,

00:15:57.871 --> 00:15:59.979
share a fact about a shark.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.600
I'm going to do it with you
because it's actually really fun.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.550
Even though you guys are kind of dark -

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:07.900
Okay, ready? Smile!

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.985
Okay. So don't get distracted
with the missed call or text.

00:16:10.985 --> 00:16:13.705
This'll only take a minute,
and I'm off the stage, so ...

00:16:13.705 --> 00:16:15.480
All right, let's do this together.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:19.560
We're going to make a difference,
a measurable impact for sharks.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.650
So I'm going to Instagram.

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:25.239
This is how the world is now, right?
We all just walk around on our phones.

00:16:25.239 --> 00:16:27.330
I think I saw that on a talk earlier.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.510
This is all good. Okay next.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:31.870
So I'm going to use a hashtag.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.502
#HelpSaveSharks.

00:16:35.521 --> 00:16:37.521
Okay. #HelpSaveBella.

00:16:37.521 --> 00:16:40.240
Here with the amazing group
at TEDx conference in Europe,

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.990
helping spread great ideas and ways
we can help save sharks and our future.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:45.303
Sharks are important.

00:16:45.303 --> 00:16:47.649
Redefining the relationships
we have with sharks.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:52.250
#SharkConservation, #HelpSaveSharks,
#NoSharkFinSoup, #TEDSavesSharks,

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.753
#TEDTalksonSharks.

00:16:53.753 --> 00:16:54.842
Okay.

00:16:54.842 --> 00:16:56.383
And I will share that.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:57.880
Awesome!

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.640
And this is the best part.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.510
I get to thank you all

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:04.734
for being a part of the force

00:17:04.734 --> 00:17:09.040
that redefines the relationship 
we have with sharks for a better future.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.390
Thank you, guys.

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:13.530
(Applause)
