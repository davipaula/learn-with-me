00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.630
I have two passions:

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.686
first football.

00:00:16.686 --> 00:00:20.396
I am a super fan, let's see 
if you can guess the team.

00:00:20.396 --> 00:00:22.806
(Laughter)

00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:25.627
I am of course, a Real Madrid fan.

00:00:25.627 --> 00:00:29.765
I am also a goalkeeper
at the Villanubla football club.

00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:36.265
My other passion are computers,
video games and programming,

00:00:36.265 --> 00:00:39.388
which is what I am going 
to talk about today.

00:00:39.388 --> 00:00:42.644
During playtime, 
we kids go crazy about

00:00:42.644 --> 00:00:46.494
Wii, PSP and Nintendo.

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:51.320
We always try to play a little more

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.388
by finishing our home works faster

00:00:53.388 --> 00:00:55.874
by cleaning up our bedroom,

00:00:55.874 --> 00:00:58.134
whatever it takes in order 
to pass the level,

00:00:58.134 --> 00:01:00.884
or to beat our previous scores.

00:01:00.884 --> 00:01:02.710
One day I thought:

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.876
What if instead of just playing,

00:01:05.876 --> 00:01:10.302
I could create my own screens, 
heroes and bad guys,

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:13.753
punches, pirouettes and extra lives?

00:01:13.753 --> 00:01:17.138
Unattainable? No, no.

00:01:17.138 --> 00:01:20.523
A child my age can do it!

00:01:20.523 --> 00:01:24.172
While new technologies are everywhere,

00:01:24.172 --> 00:01:28.571
and grownups use them for their stuff,

00:01:28.571 --> 00:01:31.531
such as computers in the cars --

00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:34.688
although my parents still get lost --

00:01:34.688 --> 00:01:38.831
cell phones, checking up emails, shopping,

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:40.386
going through the internet;

00:01:40.386 --> 00:01:43.056
children use them to play.

00:01:43.056 --> 00:01:44.565
Because we are children,

00:01:44.565 --> 00:01:47.235
and that's what we like the most.

00:01:47.235 --> 00:01:50.454
We all know that for us children,

00:01:50.454 --> 00:01:53.306
it is second nature to handle

00:01:53.306 --> 00:01:57.117
those tech devices that many adults --

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:59.587
Maybe because we're not afraid to touch,

00:01:59.587 --> 00:02:02.606
to try things out and see 
what is in there,

00:02:02.606 --> 00:02:06.244
or even break them, because 
parents can later fix everything up.

00:02:06.244 --> 00:02:08.442
(Laughter)

00:02:08.442 --> 00:02:13.184
This childlike curiosity helped me 
create my own games.

00:02:13.184 --> 00:02:16.420
I realized that I could learn by playing

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.910
and play while learning.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.264
I could experiment, create,

00:02:20.264 --> 00:02:23.264
share, understand and reason

00:02:23.264 --> 00:02:25.790
how things are made, and then use that

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.757
with everything else I was learning.

00:02:27.757 --> 00:02:31.471
Turns out that all that learning

00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:36.518
is what adults call Creative Computing.

00:02:36.933 --> 00:02:41.535
I was once told that 
programming is like a play.

00:02:41.535 --> 00:02:45.505
We have a scenario with our actors

00:02:45.505 --> 00:02:48.741
who will interact upon our instructions.

00:02:49.093 --> 00:02:52.336
We can disguise them to create animations

00:02:52.336 --> 00:02:55.755
or add up images, sounds, etc.

00:02:57.446 --> 00:03:01.925
You probably think: 
this sounds good, but a little kid,

00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:06.733
alone in his room, programming --

00:03:07.507 --> 00:03:09.800
Not exactly social.

00:03:09.803 --> 00:03:11.832
Well, there is more to it than that.

00:03:11.832 --> 00:03:16.062
It's an open, public community worldwide,

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:20.061
where we can belong and where
we can publish our programs,

00:03:20.061 --> 00:03:24.011
or download programs and play with them,

00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:27.638
see how they were made, 
modify or improve them.

00:03:27.638 --> 00:03:31.186
Nowadays, this community shares

00:03:31.186 --> 00:03:34.526
more than 10,000 programs,

00:03:34.526 --> 00:03:38.193
in a community of children, grownups,

00:03:38.193 --> 00:03:42.219
and professors of colleges, 
institutes and universities.

00:03:42.524 --> 00:03:44.834
As I became more and more passionate,

00:03:44.834 --> 00:03:48.496
I made new friends 
with whom I shared creations,

00:03:48.496 --> 00:03:52.414
then I thought that if 
I taught my schoolmates

00:03:52.414 --> 00:03:55.498
they could also enjoy as much as I.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.617
Besides, programming helps me 
learn in a very fun way

00:04:01.617 --> 00:04:03.939
what we were learning at school.

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:06.148
It was an aha moment.

00:04:06.148 --> 00:04:10.498
Last year, when we were learning 
about human bones in class

00:04:10.498 --> 00:04:14.794
I came up with a Q&amp;A game, this is it:

00:04:14.794 --> 00:04:15.582
(Video)

00:04:15.582 --> 00:04:19.882
I'll show you the game I created 
to learn the human skeleton bones

00:04:19.882 --> 00:04:23.318
for a class I had last year.

00:04:23.318 --> 00:04:27.171
In this game the human body

00:04:27.891 --> 00:04:31.011
asks you where the bones are.

00:04:31.011 --> 00:04:32.390
I'll click the green check

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.960
I'll display it full screen,

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.150
and it asks you where the jaw is?

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.568
you have to answer with the right number

00:04:39.568 --> 00:04:42.592
if it is 10, 11, 1, 2 or 3.

00:04:42.592 --> 00:04:46.832
I answer 10 which is the right one 
and it says "Correeeect!"

00:04:47.784 --> 00:04:50.695
but if your answer is wrong it says:

00:04:52.117 --> 00:04:55.117
"Wah, wah, wah".

00:04:55.117 --> 00:04:59.153
I recorded and added 
every sound to the game,

00:04:59.842 --> 00:05:02.371
I added right and wrong answers.

00:05:02.371 --> 00:05:06.056
The program scores right 
and deducts wrong answers

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:10.144
so I can now play 
and compete with my friends,

00:05:10.144 --> 00:05:13.222
to see who knows the human bones better.

00:05:13.222 --> 00:05:17.752
(Applauses)

00:05:21.813 --> 00:05:24.501
I had so much fun programming the game

00:05:24.501 --> 00:05:28.303
and it became so helpful for my learning,

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:32.001
that I asked my teacher
if we could use it in class.

00:05:32.001 --> 00:05:34.884
I wanted to show everybody, and so I did.

00:05:34.884 --> 00:05:39.611
We picked a day for me to show 
my classmates all those projects,

00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:46.409
I showed them how they were 
as capable as me to do the same.

00:05:47.043 --> 00:05:50.561
Of course, they loved it.

00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:54.250
Children and teachers liked it so much,
that this year we founded

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.690
The Programming Club 
"El páramo de Villanubla"

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.950
a group of 26 children, so far,

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:05.089
who enjoy programming 
individually or as a team.

00:06:05.726 --> 00:06:09.425
Now I am working on a game about space

00:06:09.425 --> 00:06:13.635
(Video) I am going to show you the game 
I created with the video sensor,

00:06:13.635 --> 00:06:16.236
about planets and the solar system.

00:06:16.236 --> 00:06:19.404
You have to head punch the planets

00:06:19.404 --> 00:06:21.424
so they don't fall into the sea.

00:06:21.424 --> 00:06:23.314
I switch to full screen

00:06:23.314 --> 00:06:26.812
I added right and wrong answers, 
and here is the sea.

00:06:26.812 --> 00:06:28.562
The planets start to fall,

00:06:28.562 --> 00:06:34.001
You aim the camera towards you 
so it follows your head movements

00:06:34.983 --> 00:06:38.392
to head punch the planets 
on the screen, if you hit them,

00:06:38.392 --> 00:06:41.262
you hear the name and the planet shape 
switches into a label on the screen.

00:06:41.262 --> 00:06:44.392
and it scores points for every head punch.

00:06:44.392 --> 00:06:47.688
But if you fail to punch the planet,

00:06:48.703 --> 00:06:52.256
you hear them fall into the sea 
and a point gets deducted from the score.

00:06:54.784 --> 00:06:57.649
Well, I think you get the idea.

00:06:57.649 --> 00:07:00.503
(Applause)

00:07:04.277 --> 00:07:08.401
Isn't it cool? And knowing 
that I did it, makes it better!

00:07:08.401 --> 00:07:12.722
Besides I'm going to show it
to the 5-year-old kids at school

00:07:12.722 --> 00:07:17.824
who are learning about the solar system,

00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:21.158
and I bet this game 
will help them learn better.

00:07:21.158 --> 00:07:22.968
This makes me even happier,

00:07:22.968 --> 00:07:27.651
knowing that my games 
are not just fun, but useful.

00:07:28.058 --> 00:07:32.227
Yet, it's not the first time I program
something for the little kids at school.

00:07:32.574 --> 00:07:37.414
Since my parents noticed that I liked it 
and I was doing well at school,

00:07:37.414 --> 00:07:40.495
when I turned 7, I got a present.

00:07:40.495 --> 00:07:44.735
When I first saw it, I was like,
What is this, some cables?

00:07:45.211 --> 00:07:48.775
And they told me: 
"With this you'll do magic."

00:07:48.775 --> 00:07:52.194
They were right, I'm going to show you.

00:07:52.194 --> 00:07:55.293
It was a Makey Makey board.

00:07:55.293 --> 00:07:57.482
By connecting it to a computer,

00:07:57.482 --> 00:08:00.826
you can plug cables 
to anything as original as

00:08:00.826 --> 00:08:05.146
gummies, play dough, fruit, pencils, water

00:08:05.146 --> 00:08:07.488
or just by touching them,

00:08:07.488 --> 00:08:11.813
make programs and games
work as if it is magic.

00:08:11.813 --> 00:08:16.699
I told this to Marga, the teacher
of the 4 year olds at my school

00:08:16.699 --> 00:08:19.866
and she asked me if we 
could do a special project

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:23.198
about music and orchestra instruments.

00:08:23.525 --> 00:08:25.090
Both teachers and students

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:29.416
would make instruments 
with cardboard and foamy.

00:08:29.938 --> 00:08:33.042
meanwhile, I had to build 
the necessary programs

00:08:33.042 --> 00:08:36.749
so that the instruments would 
come to life and sound real.

00:08:36.749 --> 00:08:39.991
So I told this to Juanje, 
a friend of mine,

00:08:39.991 --> 00:08:43.261
and we both started working.

00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:46.140
For us this was an interesting project

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.208
but it was challenging:

00:08:48.208 --> 00:08:52.572
because little kids 
were supposed to listen to us,

00:08:52.572 --> 00:08:54.243
and we are children too!

00:08:54.557 --> 00:08:59.348
When everything was set, 
we gather all the kids

00:08:59.348 --> 00:09:02.725
and showed them the sound 
of their instruments.

00:09:02.986 --> 00:09:06.735
We even taught them that 
they too had music within.

00:09:06.735 --> 00:09:09.712
It was mind blowing!
Little kids were great.

00:09:09.712 --> 00:09:14.316
We organized groups so everyone 
could play their instruments.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.850
We were truly seen as magicians

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.085
who had used some cables and a computer

00:09:21.085 --> 00:09:25.565
to impress both adults and kids.

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:28.819
Well, do you want to se how we did it?

00:09:28.819 --> 00:09:31.108
I'm going to show you

00:09:31.108 --> 00:09:33.964
I brought some of those instruments.

00:09:33.964 --> 00:09:36.994
By the way, I want to thank my school

00:09:36.994 --> 00:09:39.466
for letting me show you 
a bit of that magic,

00:09:39.466 --> 00:09:41.826
something any kid can do

00:09:41.826 --> 00:09:46.238
just with a little of imagination, 
cables and a computer

00:09:48.585 --> 00:09:52.723
To play this super piano
made by four year olds,

00:09:52.723 --> 00:09:55.490
I have to remove my shoes.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:57.880
My feet are clean, eh!

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.087
(Laughter)

00:10:00.692 --> 00:10:04.012
Let's see if you know this song.

00:10:04.891 --> 00:10:07.341
(Music)

00:10:48.719 --> 00:10:51.236
(Applause)

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.504
Now I'm going to show you 
how water makes more sounds

00:11:04.504 --> 00:11:07.105
than those made when 
it comes out of the faucet.

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:11.200
This song is dedicated to my grandma

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.954
because next week is her birthday

00:11:13.954 --> 00:11:15.982
(Laughter)

00:11:15.982 --> 00:11:20.032
(Applause)

00:11:22.756 --> 00:11:24.865
(Music)

00:11:32.002 --> 00:11:33.907
(Applause)

00:11:36.549 --> 00:11:40.285
I will now need four volunteers.

00:11:40.285 --> 00:11:44.118
Here and now we are 
going to hear their sound.

00:11:44.959 --> 00:11:47.666
Let's see, the four guys over there.

00:11:47.666 --> 00:11:50.036
(Laughter)

00:11:50.036 --> 00:11:52.703
(Applause)

00:11:58.143 --> 00:11:59.728
Pick this one.

00:12:01.079 --> 00:12:03.600
You pick that one.

00:12:21.456 --> 00:12:23.936
Let's hear what instrument you sound like.

00:12:29.513 --> 00:12:31.685
(Noise)

00:12:31.685 --> 00:12:33.725
Wow! you sound like a noise!

00:12:33.725 --> 00:12:35.045
(Battery dish)

00:12:35.045 --> 00:12:36.973
You sound like battery dishes

00:12:37.247 --> 00:12:38.637
You have no sound.

00:12:38.637 --> 00:12:40.348
(Laughter)

00:12:40.348 --> 00:12:43.590
(Drum roll)

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:44.750
You sound like a drum.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.904
And you, let's see what do you sound like.

00:12:47.929 --> 00:12:49.546
(Neighing)

00:12:49.546 --> 00:12:51.448
Oh we have a horse!!

00:12:51.448 --> 00:12:52.876
(Laughter)

00:12:52.876 --> 00:12:55.610
(Applause)

00:13:01.735 --> 00:13:05.120
I hope you enjoyed what I brought to you.

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:07.890
See how I was not fooling you?

00:13:07.897 --> 00:13:09.785
You can imagine, create and share

00:13:09.785 --> 00:13:14.077
just with some cables,
a bit of imagination and a computer.

00:13:14.764 --> 00:13:18.119
Try it out kids! Stop just being gamers,

00:13:18.119 --> 00:13:22.440
and become creators of stories, 
game programs and musical projects.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.084
Our imagination is the limit.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.825
But go beyond!

00:13:28.825 --> 00:13:32.406
Show it to the world, upload it
to the web for others to see,

00:13:32.406 --> 00:13:36.002
and more people can play,

00:13:36.002 --> 00:13:39.334
but knowing that we as kids,

00:13:39.334 --> 00:13:42.947
can decide too how 
we want things done.

00:13:43.488 --> 00:13:47.616
And I ask all the parents 
that please help us put together

00:13:47.616 --> 00:13:52.599
programming workshops 
at schools so every kid can learn this.

00:13:52.609 --> 00:13:55.579
It is important for your kids.

00:13:56.493 --> 00:13:59.879
(Applause)

00:14:01.459 --> 00:14:05.102
Never forget that nothing is impossible,

00:14:05.102 --> 00:14:08.574
It's all up to our effort and 
desire of self-improvement,

00:14:08.574 --> 00:14:13.742
even if we are young, 
we have a lot to teach in return.

00:14:13.742 --> 00:14:16.787
Thank you so much for your attention, 
see you soon.

00:14:16.787 --> 00:14:19.428
(Applause)
