00:00:13.928 --> 00:00:15.500
Mark Miskin: This is a rotifer.

00:00:15.524 --> 00:00:18.698
It's a microorganism
about a hair's width in size.

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:22.408
They live everywhere on earth --
saltwater, freshwater, everywhere --

00:00:22.432 --> 00:00:24.673
and this one is out looking for food.

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.635
I remember the first time
I saw this thing,

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:30.389
I was like eight years old
and it completely blew me away.

00:00:30.413 --> 00:00:32.676
I mean, here is this
incredible little creature,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.300
it's hunting, swimming,

00:00:34.324 --> 00:00:35.589
going about its life,

00:00:35.613 --> 00:00:39.063
but its whole universe fits
within a drop of pond water.

00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:43.653
Paul McEuen: So this little rotifer
shows us something really amazing.

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:45.725
It says that you can build a machine

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:49.134
that is functional, complex, smart,

00:00:49.158 --> 00:00:51.676
but all in a tiny little package,

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.785
one so small that
it's impossible to see it.

00:00:56.134 --> 00:00:59.479
Now, the engineer in me
is just blown away by this thing,

00:00:59.503 --> 00:01:01.640
that anyone could make such a creature.

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.248
But right behind that wonder,
I have to admit, is a bit of envy.

00:01:06.578 --> 00:01:09.692
I mean, nature can do it. Why can't we?

00:01:10.518 --> 00:01:12.488
Why can't we build tiny robots?

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:15.587
Well, I'm not the only one
to have this idea.

00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:18.270
In fact, in the last, oh, few years,

00:01:18.294 --> 00:01:21.247
researchers around the world
have taken up the task

00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:23.346
of trying to build robots

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.200
that are so small that they can't be seen.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.878
And what we're going
to tell you about today

00:01:28.902 --> 00:01:30.750
is an effort at Cornell University

00:01:30.774 --> 00:01:33.082
and now at the University of Pennsylvania

00:01:33.106 --> 00:01:35.461
to try to build tiny robots.

00:01:36.064 --> 00:01:37.896
OK, so that's the goal.

00:01:38.523 --> 00:01:39.875
But how do we do it?

00:01:40.503 --> 00:01:42.699
How do we go about building tiny robots?

00:01:43.348 --> 00:01:47.115
Well, Pablo Picasso, of all people,
gives us our first clue.

00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:48.804
Picasso said --

00:01:48.828 --> 00:01:50.848
["Good artists copy,
great artists steal."]

00:01:50.872 --> 00:01:51.841
(Laughter)

00:01:51.865 --> 00:01:54.332
"Good artists copy. Great artists steal."

00:01:54.356 --> 00:01:55.764
(Laughter)

00:01:55.788 --> 00:01:58.255
OK. But steal from what?

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:59.527
Well, believe it or not,

00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:03.626
most of the technology you need
to build a tiny robot already exists.

00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:07.121
The semiconductor industry
has been getting better and better

00:02:07.145 --> 00:02:09.275
at making tinier and tinier devices,

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.176
so at this point they could put
something like a million transistors

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.019
into the size of a package
that is occupied by, say,

00:02:16.043 --> 00:02:18.067
a single-celled paramecium.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.260
And it's not just electronics.

00:02:21.284 --> 00:02:23.108
They can also build little sensors,

00:02:23.132 --> 00:02:24.303
LEDs,

00:02:24.327 --> 00:02:28.058
whole communication packages
that are too small to be seen.

00:02:28.961 --> 00:02:30.551
So that's what we're going to do.

00:02:30.575 --> 00:02:32.420
We're going to steal that technology.

00:02:32.762 --> 00:02:33.937
Here's a robot.

00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:35.583
(Laughter)

00:02:35.607 --> 00:02:37.783
Robot's got two parts, as it turns out.

00:02:37.807 --> 00:02:39.830
It's got a head, and it's got legs.

00:02:39.854 --> 00:02:41.066
[Steal these: Brains]

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.553
(Laughter)

00:02:44.512 --> 00:02:47.389
We're going to call this a legless robot,

00:02:47.413 --> 00:02:49.045
which may sound exotic,

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.775
but they're pretty cool all by themselves.

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.064
In fact, most of you have
a legless robot with you right now.

00:02:55.571 --> 00:02:59.533
Your smartphone is the world's
most successful legless robot.

00:03:00.204 --> 00:03:03.599
In just 15 years, it has
taken over the entire planet.

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:05.242
And why not?

00:03:05.266 --> 00:03:07.525
It's such a beautiful little machine.

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.145
It's incredibly intelligent,

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:11.197
it's got great communication skills,

00:03:11.221 --> 00:03:14.057
and it's all in a package
that you can hold in your hand.

00:03:14.517 --> 00:03:17.244
So we would like to be able
to build something like this,

00:03:17.268 --> 00:03:19.351
only down at the cellular scale,

00:03:19.375 --> 00:03:20.823
the size of a paramecium.

00:03:21.165 --> 00:03:22.587
And here it is.

00:03:22.611 --> 00:03:25.240
This is our cell-sized smartphone.

00:03:25.264 --> 00:03:27.349
It even kind of looks like a smartphone,

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:30.437
only it's about 10,000 times smaller.

00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:32.350
We call it an OWIC.

00:03:32.374 --> 00:03:35.283
[Optical Wireless Integrated Circuits]

00:03:35.307 --> 00:03:37.245
OK, we're not advertisers, all right?

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.681
(Laughter)

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.222
But it's pretty cool all by itself.

00:03:42.246 --> 00:03:44.472
In fact, this OWIC has a number of parts.

00:03:44.496 --> 00:03:46.009
So up near the top,

00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:49.548
there are these cool little solar cells
that you shine light on the device

00:03:49.572 --> 00:03:52.400
and it wakes up a little circuit
that's there in the middle.

00:03:52.424 --> 00:03:54.543
And that circuit can drive
a little tiny LED

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:58.038
that can blink at you and allows
the OWIC to communicate with you.

00:03:58.062 --> 00:03:59.454
So unlike your cell phone,

00:03:59.478 --> 00:04:01.206
the OWIC communicates with light,

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.775
sort of like a tiny firefly.

00:04:04.342 --> 00:04:06.779
Now, one thing that's pretty cool
about these OWICs

00:04:06.803 --> 00:04:08.546
is we don't make them one at a time,

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.298
soldering all the pieces together.

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.886
We make them in massive parallel.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.286
For example, about a million
of these OWICs

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.266
can fit on a single four-inch wafer.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.395
And just like your phone
has different apps,

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.245
you can have different kinds of OWICs.

00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:24.394
There can be ones that, say,
measure voltage,

00:04:24.418 --> 00:04:25.876
some that measure temperature,

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.621
or just have a little light that can blink
at you to tell you that it's there.

00:04:29.645 --> 00:04:32.886
So that's pretty cool,
these tiny little devices.

00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:36.420
And I'd like to tell you about them
in a little more detail.

00:04:36.444 --> 00:04:39.310
But first, I have to tell you
about something else.

00:04:39.334 --> 00:04:42.798
I'm going to tell you a few things
about pennies that you might not know.

00:04:42.822 --> 00:04:44.789
So this one is a little bit older penny.

00:04:44.813 --> 00:04:47.413
It's got a picture of
the Lincoln Memorial on the back.

00:04:47.437 --> 00:04:49.310
But the first thing you might not know,

00:04:49.334 --> 00:04:52.274
that if you zoom in, you'll find
in the center of this thing

00:04:52.298 --> 00:04:54.154
you can actually see Abraham Lincoln,

00:04:54.178 --> 00:04:57.050
just like in the real Lincoln Memorial
not so far from here.

00:04:57.074 --> 00:04:58.861
What I'm sure you don't know,

00:04:58.885 --> 00:05:01.111
that if you zoom in even further --

00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:02.579
(Laughter)

00:05:02.603 --> 00:05:06.660
you'll see that there's actually
an OWIC on Abe Lincoln's chest.

00:05:06.684 --> 00:05:09.258
(Laughter)

00:05:09.282 --> 00:05:10.948
But the cool thing is,

00:05:10.972 --> 00:05:14.301
you could stare at this all day long
and you would never see it.

00:05:15.377 --> 00:05:17.208
It's invisible to the naked eye.

00:05:17.232 --> 00:05:18.814
These OWICs are so small,

00:05:18.838 --> 00:05:21.329
and we make them in such parallel fashion,

00:05:21.353 --> 00:05:24.319
that each OWIC costs actually
less than a penny.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.672
In fact, the most expensive thing
in this demo is that little sticker

00:05:28.696 --> 00:05:30.013
that says "OWIC."

00:05:30.037 --> 00:05:32.994
(Laughter)

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:36.932
That cost about eight cents.

00:05:36.956 --> 00:05:38.596
(Laughter)

00:05:40.266 --> 00:05:43.565
Now, we're very excited about
these things for all sorts of reasons.

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:46.756
For example, we can use them
as little tiny secure smart tags,

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.732
more identifying than a fingerprint.

00:05:48.756 --> 00:05:51.738
We're actually putting them inside
of other medical instruments

00:05:51.762 --> 00:05:53.008
to give other information,

00:05:53.032 --> 00:05:55.798
and even starting to think about
putting them in the brain

00:05:55.822 --> 00:05:57.567
to listen to neurons one at a time.

00:05:57.591 --> 00:06:00.444
In fact, there's only one thing
wrong with these OWICs:

00:06:01.574 --> 00:06:02.880
it's not a robot.

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:04.240
It's just a head.

00:06:04.264 --> 00:06:05.383
(Laughter)

00:06:05.407 --> 00:06:07.256
And I think we'll all agree

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.459
that half a robot
really isn't a robot at all.

00:06:11.553 --> 00:06:14.314
Without the legs,
we've got basically nothing.

00:06:14.837 --> 00:06:18.136
MM: OK, so you need the legs, too,
if you want to build a robot.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.584
Now, here it turns out
you can't just steal

00:06:20.608 --> 00:06:22.528
some preexisting technology.

00:06:22.552 --> 00:06:26.970
If you want legs for your tiny robot,
you need actuators, parts that move.

00:06:26.994 --> 00:06:29.472
They have to satisfy
a lot of different requirements.

00:06:29.486 --> 00:06:31.416
They need to be low voltage.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.955
They need to be low power, too.

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:35.040
But most importantly,
they have to be small.

00:06:35.064 --> 00:06:38.764
If you want to build a cell-sized robot,
you need cell-sized legs.

00:06:38.788 --> 00:06:40.518
Now, nobody knows how to build that.

00:06:40.542 --> 00:06:43.919
There was no preexisting technology
that meets all of those demands.

00:06:43.943 --> 00:06:46.405
To make our legs for our tiny robots,

00:06:46.429 --> 00:06:47.929
we had to make something new.

00:06:47.953 --> 00:06:49.595
So here's what we built.

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:52.576
This is one of our actuators,
and I'm applying a voltage to it.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.586
When I do, you can see
the actuator respond by curling up.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.305
Now, this might not look like much,

00:06:57.329 --> 00:07:01.114
but if we were to put a red blood cell
up on the screen, it'd be about that big,

00:07:01.138 --> 00:07:03.111
so these are unbelievably tiny curls.

00:07:03.135 --> 00:07:04.437
They're unbelievably small,

00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:08.249
and yet this device can just bend
and unbend, no problem, nothing breaks.

00:07:08.273 --> 00:07:09.426
So how do we do it?

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.847
Well, the actuator is made
from a layer of platinum

00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:13.362
just a dozen atoms or so thick.

00:07:13.386 --> 00:07:16.174
Now it turns out, if you take
platinum and put it in water

00:07:16.198 --> 00:07:17.447
and apply a voltage to it,

00:07:17.471 --> 00:07:19.972
atoms from the water
will attach or remove themselves

00:07:19.996 --> 00:07:21.580
from the surface of the platinum,

00:07:21.604 --> 00:07:23.429
depending on how much voltage you use.

00:07:23.453 --> 00:07:24.620
This creates a force,

00:07:24.644 --> 00:07:27.524
and you can use that force
for voltage-controlled actuation.

00:07:27.548 --> 00:07:30.435
The key here was to make
everything ultrathin.

00:07:30.459 --> 00:07:32.227
Then your actuator is flexible enough

00:07:32.251 --> 00:07:34.403
to bend to these small
sizes without breaking,

00:07:34.427 --> 00:07:36.386
and it can use the forces that come about

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.038
from just attaching or removing
a single layer of atoms.

00:07:39.062 --> 00:07:41.699
Now, we don't have to build these
one at a time, either.

00:07:41.723 --> 00:07:43.120
In fact, just like the OWICs,

00:07:43.144 --> 00:07:45.480
we can build them massively
in parallel as well.

00:07:45.504 --> 00:07:47.931
So here's a couple thousand
or so actuators,

00:07:47.955 --> 00:07:50.198
and all I'm doing is applying a voltage,

00:07:50.222 --> 00:07:51.862
and they all wave,

00:07:51.886 --> 00:07:55.443
looking like nothing more than the legs
of a future robot army.

00:07:55.467 --> 00:07:57.551
(Laughter)

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.913
So now we've got the brains
and we've got the brawn.

00:08:00.937 --> 00:08:03.376
We've got the smarts and the actuators.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.733
The OWICs are the brains.

00:08:04.737 --> 00:08:07.173
They give us sensors,
they give us power supplies,

00:08:07.197 --> 00:08:10.052
and they give us a two-way
communication system via light.

00:08:10.076 --> 00:08:11.766
The platinum layers are the muscle.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:13.951
They're what's going
to move the robot around.

00:08:13.975 --> 00:08:16.425
Now we can take those two pieces,
put them together

00:08:16.449 --> 00:08:18.532
and start to build our tiny, tiny robots.

00:08:18.556 --> 00:08:21.533
The first thing we wanted to build
was something really simple.

00:08:21.557 --> 00:08:23.560
This robot walks around
under user control.

00:08:23.584 --> 00:08:26.686
In the middle are some solar cells
and some wiring attached to it.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:27.861
That's the OWIC.

00:08:27.885 --> 00:08:30.811
They're connected to a set of legs
which have a platinum layer

00:08:30.835 --> 00:08:32.801
and these rigid panels that we put on top

00:08:32.825 --> 00:08:35.832
that tell the legs how to fold up,
which shape they should take.

00:08:35.856 --> 00:08:38.979
The idea is that by shooting a laser
at the different solar cells,

00:08:39.003 --> 00:08:40.978
you can choose which leg you want to move

00:08:41.002 --> 00:08:42.628
and make the robot walk around.

00:08:42.652 --> 00:08:45.419
Now, of course, we don't build those
one at a time, either.

00:08:45.443 --> 00:08:47.525
We build them massively
in parallel as well.

00:08:47.549 --> 00:08:51.114
We can build something like one million
robots on a single four-inch wafer.

00:08:51.138 --> 00:08:53.822
So, for example, this image
on the left, this is a chip,

00:08:53.846 --> 00:08:56.415
and this chip has something like
10,000 robots on it.

00:08:56.439 --> 00:08:58.120
Now, in our world, the macro world,

00:08:58.144 --> 00:09:01.372
this thing looks like it might be
a new microprocessor or something.

00:09:01.396 --> 00:09:04.271
But if you take that chip
and you put it under a microscope,

00:09:04.295 --> 00:09:07.898
what you're going to see are
thousands and thousands of tiny robots.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.301
Now, these robots are still stuck down.

00:09:10.325 --> 00:09:13.164
They're still attached to the surface
that we built them on.

00:09:13.188 --> 00:09:15.925
In order for them to walk around,
we have to release them.

00:09:15.949 --> 00:09:19.415
We wanted to show you how we do that live,
how we release the robot army,

00:09:19.439 --> 00:09:22.339
but the process involves
highly dangerous chemicals,

00:09:22.363 --> 00:09:25.120
like, really nasty stuff,

00:09:25.144 --> 00:09:27.677
and we're like a mile
from the White House right now?

00:09:27.701 --> 00:09:30.109
Yeah. They wouldn't let us do it.

00:09:30.133 --> 00:09:31.291
So --

00:09:31.315 --> 00:09:33.245
(Laughter)

00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:36.464
so we're going to show you
a movie instead. (Laughs)

00:09:37.072 --> 00:09:40.387
What you're looking at here
are the final stages of robot deployment.

00:09:40.411 --> 00:09:41.566
We're using chemicals

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:44.114
to etch the substrate
out from underneath the robots.

00:09:44.138 --> 00:09:47.665
When it dissolves, the robots are free
to fold up into their final shapes.

00:09:47.689 --> 00:09:50.152
Now, you can see here,
the yield's about 90 percent,

00:09:50.176 --> 00:09:52.809
so almost every one of those
10,000 robots we build,

00:09:52.833 --> 00:09:55.681
that's a robot that we can
deploy and control later.

00:09:55.705 --> 00:09:58.724
And we can take those robots
and we can put them places as well.

00:09:58.748 --> 00:10:02.011
So if you look at the movie on the left,
that's some robots in water.

00:10:02.035 --> 00:10:03.993
I'm going to come along with a pipette,

00:10:04.017 --> 00:10:05.629
and I can vacuum them all up.

00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:09.259
Now when you inject the robots
back out of that pipette,

00:10:09.283 --> 00:10:10.436
they're just fine.

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.138
In fact, these robots are so small,

00:10:12.162 --> 00:10:15.318
they're small enough to pass through
the thinnest hypodermic needle

00:10:15.342 --> 00:10:16.496
you can buy.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.244
Yeah, so if you wanted to,

00:10:18.268 --> 00:10:20.597
you could inject yourself full of robots.

00:10:20.621 --> 00:10:22.287
(Laughter)

00:10:22.733 --> 00:10:24.388
I think they're into it.

00:10:24.412 --> 00:10:26.087
(Laughter)

00:10:27.274 --> 00:10:29.980
On the right is a robot
that we put in some pond water.

00:10:30.004 --> 00:10:32.285
I want you to wait for just one second.

00:10:32.309 --> 00:10:34.133
Ooop!

00:10:34.157 --> 00:10:38.385
You see that? That was no shark.
That was a paramecium.

00:10:38.409 --> 00:10:40.886
So that's the world
that these things live in.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.527
OK, so this is all well and good,

00:10:42.551 --> 00:10:44.570
but you might be wondering at this point,

00:10:44.594 --> 00:10:46.410
"Well, do they walk?"

00:10:46.434 --> 00:10:50.726
Right? That's what they're supposed to do.
They better. So let's find out.

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.743
So here's the robot and here
are its solar cells in the middle.

00:10:53.767 --> 00:10:55.397
Those are those little rectangles.

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:58.715
I want you to look at the solar cell
closest to the top of the slide.

00:10:58.739 --> 00:11:00.953
See that little white dot?
That's a laser spot.

00:11:00.977 --> 00:11:03.692
Now watch what happens
when we start switching that laser

00:11:03.716 --> 00:11:05.758
between different
solar cells on the robot.

00:11:09.567 --> 00:11:11.000
Off it goes!

00:11:11.024 --> 00:11:13.497
(Applause)

00:11:13.521 --> 00:11:14.697
Yeah!

00:11:14.721 --> 00:11:18.756
(Applause)

00:11:20.469 --> 00:11:23.137
Off goes the robot
marching around the microworld.

00:11:23.613 --> 00:11:26.272
Now, one of the things
that's cool about this movie is:

00:11:26.296 --> 00:11:28.771
I'm actually piloting
the robot in this movie.

00:11:28.795 --> 00:11:33.999
In fact, for six months, my job was
to shoot lasers at tiny cell-sized robots

00:11:34.023 --> 00:11:36.186
to pilot them around the microworld.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.729
This was actually my job.

00:11:37.753 --> 00:11:40.769
As far as I could tell, that is
the coolest job in the world.

00:11:40.793 --> 00:11:42.068
(Laughter)

00:11:42.092 --> 00:11:44.409
It was just the feeling
of total excitement,

00:11:44.433 --> 00:11:46.153
like you're doing the impossible.

00:11:46.614 --> 00:11:50.139
It's a feeling of wonder like that first
time I looked through a microscope

00:11:50.163 --> 00:11:52.368
as a kid staring at that rotifer.

00:11:52.392 --> 00:11:56.065
Now, I'm a dad, I have a son of my own,
and he's about three years old.

00:11:56.089 --> 00:11:59.486
But one day, he's going to look
through a microscope like that one.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:00.913
And I often wonder:

00:12:01.715 --> 00:12:03.216
What is he going to see?

00:12:03.716 --> 00:12:05.781
Instead of just watching the microworld,

00:12:05.805 --> 00:12:08.991
we as humans can now build
technology to shape it,

00:12:09.015 --> 00:12:11.549
to interact with it, to engineer it.

00:12:12.169 --> 00:12:16.231
In 30 years, when my son is my age,
what will we do with that ability?

00:12:17.334 --> 00:12:20.590
Will microrobots live in our bloodstream,

00:12:20.614 --> 00:12:22.196
as common as bacteria?

00:12:22.888 --> 00:12:25.220
Will they live on our crops
and get rid of pests?

00:12:25.878 --> 00:12:30.093
Will they tell us when we have infections,
or will they fight cancer cell by cell?

00:12:31.952 --> 00:12:33.349
PM: And one cool part is,

00:12:33.373 --> 00:12:36.133
you're going to be able to participate
in this revolution.

00:12:36.157 --> 00:12:37.376
Ten years or so from now,

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.701
when you buy your new iPhone 15x Moto
or whatever it's called --

00:12:41.725 --> 00:12:42.741
(Laughter)

00:12:42.765 --> 00:12:46.131
it may come with a little jar
with a few thousand tiny robots in it

00:12:46.155 --> 00:12:48.853
that you can control
by an app on your cell phone.

00:12:49.424 --> 00:12:52.620
So if you want to ride
a paramecium, go for it.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.480
If you want to -- I don't know --
DJ the world's smallest robot dance party,

00:12:57.504 --> 00:12:58.664
make it happen.

00:12:58.688 --> 00:12:59.713
(Laughter)

00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:03.591
And I, for one, am very excited
about that day coming.

00:13:03.615 --> 00:13:04.852
MM: Thank you.

00:13:04.876 --> 00:13:09.064
(Applause)
