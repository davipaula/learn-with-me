00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.280
You know who I'm envious of?

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.456
People who work in a job
that has to do with their college major.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.376
(Laughter)

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.976
Journalists who studied journalism,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.960
engineers who studied engineering.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.335
The truth is, these folks
are no longer the rule,

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.616
but the exception.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.816
A 2010 study found that
only a quarter of college graduates

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.080
work in a field
that relates to their degree.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.920
I graduated with not one
but two degrees in biology.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.536
To my parents' dismay,
I am neither a doctor nor a scientist.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.576
(Laughter)

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.696
Years of studying DNA replication
and photosynthesis

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.360
did little to prepare me
for a career in technology.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.456
I had to teach myself everything
from sales, marketing, strategy,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.880
even a little programming, on my own.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.536
I had never held the title
of Product Manager

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.480
before I sent my resume in to Etsy.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.976
I had already been turned down
by Google and several other firms

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.400
and was getting frustrated.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.056
The company had recently gone public,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.856
so as part of my job application,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.456
I read the IPO filings from cover to cover

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.176
and built a website from scratch
which included my analysis of the business

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.120
and four ideas for new features.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.776
It turned out the team was actively
working on two of those ideas

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.840
and had seriously considered a third.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.360
I got the job.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.896
We all know people who were ignored
or overlooked at first

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.920
but went on to prove their critics wrong.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.000
My favorite story?

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.976
Brian Acton, an engineering manager

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.856
who was rejected
by both Twitter and Facebook

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.496
before cofounding WhatsApp,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.160
the mobile messaging platform
that would sell for 19 billion dollars.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.736
The hiring systems we built
in the 20th century are failing us

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.040
and causing us to miss out
on people with incredible potential.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.456
The advances in robotics
and machine learning

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.456
and transforming the way we work,

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.496
automating routine tasks
in many occupations

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.600
while augmenting and amplifying
human labor in others.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.496
At this rate, we should all be expecting
to do jobs we've never done before

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.039
for the rest of our careers.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.856
So what are the tools
and strategies we need

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.840
to identify tomorrow's high performers?

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.896
In search for answers, I've consulted
with leaders across many sectors,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.536
read dozens of reports and research papers

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.280
and conducted some of my own
talent experiments.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.896
My quest is far from over,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.560
but here are three ideas to take forward.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.840
One: expand your search.

00:02:48.278 --> 00:02:51.136
If we only look for talent
in the same places we always do --

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.416
gifted child programs, Ivy League schools,

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.336
prestigious organizations --

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.976
we're going to get
the same results we always have.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.696
Baseball was transformed
when the cash-strapped Oakland Athletics

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.096
started recruiting players
who didn't score highly

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.696
on traditionally valued metrics,
like runs batted in,

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.776
but who had the ability
to help the team score points

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.000
and win games.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.640
This idea is taking hold
outside of sports.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.776
The Head of Design
and Research at Pinterest

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.176
told me that they've built
one of the most diverse

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.296
and high-performing teams
in Silicon Valley

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.696
because they believe
that no one type of person

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.560
holds a monopoly on talent.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.136
They've worked hard
to look beyond major tech hubs

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.416
and focus on designers' portfolios,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.760
not their pedigrees.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.480
Two: hire for performance.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.336
Inspired by my own job experience,

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.056
I cofounded a hiring platform
called Headlight,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.720
which gives candidates
an opportunity to shine.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.216
Just as teams have tryouts
and plays have auditions,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.816
candidates should be asked
to demonstrate their skills

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.256
before they're hired.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.656
Our clients are benefiting
from 85 years of employment research,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.256
which shows that work samples

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.840
are one of the best predictors
of success on the job.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.376
If you're hiring a data analyst,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.136
give them a spreadsheet of historical data
and ask them for their key insights.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.976
If you're hiring a marketing manager,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.416
have them plan a launch campaign
for a new product.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.616
And if you're a candidate,
don't wait for an employer to ask.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.896
Seek out ways to showcase
your unique skills and abilities

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.400
outside of just the standard
resume and cover letter.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.080
Three: get the bigger picture.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.176
I've heard about recruiters who are quick
to label a candidate a job-hopper

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.896
based on a single
short stint on their resume;

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.160
read about professors who are more likely
to ignore identical messages from students

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.040
because their name
was black or Asian instead of white.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.320
I was almost put on
a special needs track as a child.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.736
A month into kindergarten,

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.376
my teacher wrote a page-long memo

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.296
noting that I was impulsive,

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.056
had a short attention span,

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.176
and despite my wonderful curiosity,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.216
I was exhausting to work with.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.840
(Laughter)

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.856
The principal asked
my parents into a meeting,

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.736
asked my mother if there
had been complications at birth

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.736
and suggested I meet
with a school psychologist.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.336
My father saw what was happening

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.440
and quickly explained
our family situation.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.776
As recent immigrants,
we lived in the attic

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.800
of a home that cared for adults
with mental disabilities.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.616
My parents worked nights
to make ends meet,

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.680
and I had little opportunity
to spend time with kids my own age.

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.536
Is it really a surprise
that an understimulated five-year-old boy

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.096
might be a little excited
in a kindergarten classroom

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.880
after an entire summer by himself?

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.416
Until we get a holistic view of someone,

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.720
our judgment of them
will always be flawed.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.056
Let's stop equating
experience with ability,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.880
credentials with competence.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.096
Let's stop settling
for the safe, familiar choice

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.080
and leave the door open
for someone who could be amazing.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.776
We need employers to let go
of outdated hiring practices

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.360
and embrace new ways
of identifying and cultivating talent,

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.176
and candidates can help
by learning to tell their story

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.760
in powerful and compelling ways.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.720
We could live in a world where people
are seen for what they're truly capable of

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.080
and have the opportunity
to realize their full potential.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.280
So let's go out and build it.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.456
Thank you.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:29.240
(Applause)
