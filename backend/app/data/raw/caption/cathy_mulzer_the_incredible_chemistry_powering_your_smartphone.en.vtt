00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:17.268
When I waltzed off to high school
with my new Nokia phone,

00:00:17.292 --> 00:00:19.684
I thought I just had
the new, coolest replacement

00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:22.684
for my old pink princess walkie-talkie.

00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:26.559
Except now, my friends and I
could text or talk to each other

00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:27.851
wherever we were,

00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:29.143
instead of pretending,

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:32.393
when we were running around
each other's backyards.

00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:34.143
Now, I'll be honest.

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:38.434
Back then, I didn't think a lot
about how these devices were made.

00:00:38.458 --> 00:00:40.809
They tended to show up
on Christmas morning,

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:43.667
so maybe they were made
by the elves in Santa's workshop.

00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:47.018
Let me ask you a question.

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:50.208
Who do you think the real elves
that make these devices are?

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.476
If I ask a lot of the people I know,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.143
they would say it's the hoodie-wearing
software engineers in Silicon Valley,

00:00:57.167 --> 00:00:58.583
hacking away at code.

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:01.768
But a lot has to happen to these devices

00:01:01.792 --> 00:01:04.101
before they're ready for any kind of code.

00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:07.643
These devices start at the atomic level.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:09.351
So if you ask me,

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:11.958
the real elves are the chemists.

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:15.125
That's right, I said the chemists.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.184
Chemistry is the hero
of electronic communications.

00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:22.976
And my goal today is to convince you

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.250
to agree with me.

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:27.559
OK, let's start simple,

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:32.018
and take a look inside
these insanely addictive devices.

00:01:32.042 --> 00:01:34.059
Because without chemistry,

00:01:34.083 --> 00:01:37.976
what is an information
superhighway that we love,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.292
would just be a really expensive,
shiny paperweight.

00:01:42.708 --> 00:01:45.250
Chemistry enables all of these layers.

00:01:46.167 --> 00:01:48.351
Let's start at the display.

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:50.934
How do you think we get
those bright, vivid colors

00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.143
that we love so much?

00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:54.434
Well, I'll tell you.

00:01:54.458 --> 00:01:57.268
There's organic polymers
embedded within the display,

00:01:57.292 --> 00:02:01.476
that can take electricity
and turn it into the blue, red and green

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.500
that we enjoy in our pictures.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.976
What if we move down to the battery?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.309
Now there's some intense research.

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:13.184
How do we take the chemical principles
of traditional batteries

00:02:13.208 --> 00:02:16.601
and pair it with new,
high surface area electrodes,

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:20.268
so we can pack more charge
in a smaller footprint of space,

00:02:20.292 --> 00:02:22.643
so that we could power
our devices all day long,

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:24.351
while we're taking selfies,

00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:26.309
without having to recharge our batteries

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:28.583
or sit tethered to an electrical outlet?

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:33.643
What if we go to the adhesives
that bind it all together,

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:36.518
so that it could withstand
our frequent usage?

00:02:36.542 --> 00:02:38.518
After all, as a millennial,

00:02:38.542 --> 00:02:42.476
I have to take my phone out
at least 200 times a day to check it,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.333
and in the process,
drop it two to three times.

00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:50.226
But what are the real brains
of these devices?

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.059
What makes them work
the way that we love them so much?

00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:57.184
Well that all has to do
with electrical components and circuitry

00:02:57.208 --> 00:03:00.643
that are tethered
to a printed circuit board.

00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:03.184
Or maybe you prefer a biological metaphor --

00:03:03.208 --> 00:03:05.417
the motherboard,
you might have heard of that.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.309
Now, the printed circuit board
doesn't really get talked about a lot.

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:12.559
And I'll be honest,
I don't know why that is.

00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:14.809
Maybe it's because
it's the least sexy layer

00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:18.518
and it's hidden beneath all of those
other sleek-looking layers.

00:03:18.542 --> 00:03:21.851
But it's time to finally give this
Clark Kent layer

00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:25.643
the Superman-worthy praise it deserves.

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:28.184
And so I ask you a question.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.333
What do you think
a printed circuit board is?

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.601
Well, consider a metaphor.

00:03:33.625 --> 00:03:35.851
Think about the city that you live in.

00:03:35.875 --> 00:03:39.184
You have all these points of interest
that you want to get to:

00:03:39.208 --> 00:03:42.101
your home, your work, restaurants,

00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:44.375
a couple of Starbucks on every block.

00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:48.458
And so we build roads
that connect them all together.

00:03:49.833 --> 00:03:52.351
That's what a printed circuit board is.

00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:55.143
Except, instead of having
things like restaurants,

00:03:55.167 --> 00:03:58.934
we have transistors on chips,

00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.268
capacitors, resistors,

00:04:00.292 --> 00:04:02.768
all of these electrical components

00:04:02.792 --> 00:04:05.976
that need to find a way
to talk to each other.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.750
And so what are our roads?

00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:11.417
Well, we build tiny copper wires.

00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:13.934
So the next question is,

00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:16.226
how do we make these tiny copper wires?

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.893
They're really small.

00:04:17.917 --> 00:04:20.393
Could it be that we go
to the hardware store,

00:04:20.417 --> 00:04:22.393
pick up a spool of copper wire,

00:04:22.417 --> 00:04:25.393
get some wire cutters, a little clip-clip,

00:04:25.417 --> 00:04:28.792
saw it all up and then, bam --
we have our printed circuit board?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.268
No way.

00:04:31.292 --> 00:04:33.726
These wires are way too small for that.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.375
And so we have to rely
on our friend: chemistry.

00:04:38.708 --> 00:04:41.809
Now, the chemical process
to make these tiny copper wires

00:04:41.833 --> 00:04:43.851
is seemingly simple.

00:04:43.875 --> 00:04:45.643
We start with a solution

00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:49.059
of positively charged copper spheres.

00:04:49.083 --> 00:04:53.518
We then add to it an insulating
printed circuit board.

00:04:53.542 --> 00:04:56.934
And we feed those
positively charged spheres

00:04:56.958 --> 00:04:58.726
negatively charged electrons

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.143
by adding formaldehyde to the mix.

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:02.934
So you might remember formaldehyde.

00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.726
Really distinct odor,

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.059
used to preserve frogs in biology class.

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:10.851
Well it turns out it can do
a lot more than just that.

00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:12.934
And it's a really key component

00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:15.208
to making these tiny copper wires.

00:05:16.208 --> 00:05:19.559
You see, the electrons
on formaldehyde have a drive.

00:05:19.583 --> 00:05:23.375
They want to jump over to those
positively charged copper spheres.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.768
And that's all because of a process
known as redox chemistry.

00:05:28.792 --> 00:05:30.059
And when that happens,

00:05:30.083 --> 00:05:33.768
we can take these positively
charged copper spheres

00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:36.226
and turn them into bright,

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.684
shiny, metallic and conductive copper.

00:05:40.708 --> 00:05:42.934
And once we have conductive copper,

00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:44.434
now we're cooking with gas.

00:05:44.458 --> 00:05:46.768
And we can get all
of those electrical components

00:05:46.792 --> 00:05:48.059
to talk to each other.

00:05:48.083 --> 00:05:50.500
So thank you once again to chemistry.

00:05:51.625 --> 00:05:53.226
And let's take a thought

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.458
and think about how far
we've come with chemistry.

00:05:57.583 --> 00:06:00.268
Clearly, in electronic communications,

00:06:00.292 --> 00:06:01.976
size matters.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.434
So let's think about
how we can shrink down our devices,

00:06:05.458 --> 00:06:09.018
so that we can go from our 1990s
Zack Morris cell phone

00:06:09.042 --> 00:06:10.893
to something a little bit more sleek,

00:06:10.917 --> 00:06:13.934
like the phones of today
that can fit in our pockets.

00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.476
Although, let's be real here:

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.351
absolutely nothing can fit
into ladies' pants pockets,

00:06:19.375 --> 00:06:22.351
if you can find a pair of pants
that has pockets.

00:06:22.375 --> 00:06:23.393
(Laughter)

00:06:23.417 --> 00:06:26.542
And I don't think chemistry
can help us with that problem.

00:06:28.833 --> 00:06:32.059
But more important
than shrinking the actual device,

00:06:32.083 --> 00:06:34.476
how do we shrink
the circuitry inside of it,

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.434
and shrink it by 100 times,

00:06:36.458 --> 00:06:39.851
so that we can take the circuitry
from the micron scale

00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:41.833
all the way down to the nanometer scale?

00:06:42.833 --> 00:06:44.101
Because, let's face it,

00:06:44.125 --> 00:06:47.726
right now we all want
more powerful and faster phones.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.917
Well, more power and faster
requires more circuitry.

00:06:53.333 --> 00:06:55.018
So how do we do this?

00:06:55.042 --> 00:06:58.768
It's not like we have some magic
electromagnetic shrink ray,

00:06:58.792 --> 00:07:01.851
like professor Wayne Szalinski used
in "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"

00:07:01.875 --> 00:07:03.226
to shrink his children.

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.542
On accident, of course.

00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:07.042
Or do we?

00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:09.726
Well, actually, in the field,

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.476
there's a process
that's pretty similar to that.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.393
And it's name is photolithography.

00:07:15.417 --> 00:07:18.768
In photolithography,
we take electromagnetic radiation,

00:07:18.792 --> 00:07:20.768
or what we tend to call light,

00:07:20.792 --> 00:07:23.434
and we use it to shrink down
some of that circuitry,

00:07:23.458 --> 00:07:27.125
so that we could cram more of it
into a really small space.

00:07:29.583 --> 00:07:31.167
Now, how does this work?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.934
Well, we start with a substrate

00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:36.893
that has a light-sensitive film on it.

00:07:36.917 --> 00:07:40.476
We then cover it with a mask
that has a pattern on top of it

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.059
of fine lines and features

00:07:42.083 --> 00:07:45.893
that are going to make the phone work
the way that we want it to.

00:07:45.917 --> 00:07:49.643
We then expose a bright light
and shine it through this mask,

00:07:49.667 --> 00:07:52.958
which creates a shadow
of that pattern on the surface.

00:07:53.875 --> 00:07:56.809
Now, anywhere that the light
can get through the mask,

00:07:56.833 --> 00:08:00.101
it's going to cause
a chemical reaction to occur.

00:08:00.125 --> 00:08:04.684
And that's going to burn the image
of that pattern into the substrate.

00:08:04.708 --> 00:08:06.809
So the question you're probably asking is,

00:08:06.833 --> 00:08:08.768
how do we go from a burned image

00:08:08.792 --> 00:08:11.851
to clean fine lines and features?

00:08:11.875 --> 00:08:14.476
And for that, we have to use
a chemical solution

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.101
called the developer.

00:08:16.125 --> 00:08:18.143
Now the developer is special.

00:08:18.167 --> 00:08:21.726
What it can do is take
all of the nonexposed areas

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.684
and remove them selectively,

00:08:23.708 --> 00:08:26.643
leaving behind clean
fine lines and features,

00:08:26.667 --> 00:08:29.250
and making our miniaturized devices work.

00:08:30.417 --> 00:08:34.101
So, we've used chemistry now
to build up our devices,

00:08:34.125 --> 00:08:37.476
and we've used it
to shrink down our devices.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.684
So I've probably convinced you
that chemistry is the true hero,

00:08:40.708 --> 00:08:42.167
and we could wrap it up there.

00:08:42.701 --> 00:08:43.851
(Applause)

00:08:43.875 --> 00:08:45.393
Hold on, we're not done.

00:08:45.417 --> 00:08:47.018
Not so fast.

00:08:47.042 --> 00:08:48.893
Because we're all human.

00:08:48.917 --> 00:08:51.518
And as a human, I always want more.

00:08:51.542 --> 00:08:54.226
And so now I want to think
about how to use chemistry

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:56.500
to extract more out of a device.

00:08:57.833 --> 00:09:01.809
Right now, we're being told
that we want something called 5G,

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:04.625
or the promised
fifth generation of wireless.

00:09:05.458 --> 00:09:07.559
Now, you might have heard of 5G

00:09:07.583 --> 00:09:09.625
in commercials
that are starting to appear.

00:09:10.708 --> 00:09:12.684
Or maybe some of you even experienced it

00:09:12.708 --> 00:09:14.875
in the 2018 winter Olympics.

00:09:15.875 --> 00:09:18.226
What I'm most excited about for 5G

00:09:18.250 --> 00:09:21.934
is that, when I'm late,
running out of the house to catch a plane,

00:09:21.958 --> 00:09:25.101
I can download movies
onto my device in 40 seconds

00:09:25.125 --> 00:09:26.792
as opposed to 40 minutes.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.809
But once true 5G is here,

00:09:29.833 --> 00:09:32.101
it's going to be a lot more
than how many movies

00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:33.458
we can put on our device.

00:09:34.458 --> 00:09:37.458
So the question is,
why is true 5G not here?

00:09:38.375 --> 00:09:40.351
And I'll let you in on a little secret.

00:09:40.375 --> 00:09:42.851
It's pretty easy to answer.

00:09:42.875 --> 00:09:44.708
It's just plain hard to do.

00:09:45.833 --> 00:09:48.684
You see, if you use
those traditional materials and copper

00:09:48.708 --> 00:09:50.601
to build 5G devices,

00:09:50.625 --> 00:09:53.625
the signal can't make it
to its final destination.

00:09:55.833 --> 00:10:00.351
Traditionally, we use
really rough insulating layers

00:10:00.375 --> 00:10:02.893
to support copper wires.

00:10:02.917 --> 00:10:04.976
Think about Velcro fasteners.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
It's the roughness of the two pieces
that make them stick together.

00:10:10.208 --> 00:10:12.643
That's pretty important
if you want to have a device

00:10:12.667 --> 00:10:13.976
that's going to last longer

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.018
than it takes you to rip it out of the box

00:10:16.042 --> 00:10:18.090
and start installing
all of your apps on it.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:21.167
But this roughness causes a problem.

00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:25.393
You see, at the high speeds for 5G

00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:29.184
the signal has to travel
close to that roughness.

00:10:29.208 --> 00:10:33.000
And it makes it get lost
before it reaches its final destination.

00:10:34.292 --> 00:10:36.018
Think about a mountain range.

00:10:36.042 --> 00:10:39.518
And you have a complex system of roads
that goes up and over it,

00:10:39.542 --> 00:10:42.268
and you're trying
to get to the other side.

00:10:42.292 --> 00:10:43.559
Don't you agree with me

00:10:43.583 --> 00:10:46.976
that it would probably take
a really long time,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.059
and you would probably get lost,

00:10:49.083 --> 00:10:51.726
if you had to go up and down
all of the mountains,

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.143
as opposed to if you just
drilled a flat tunnel

00:10:54.167 --> 00:10:56.601
that could go straight on through?

00:10:56.625 --> 00:10:59.309
Well it's the same thing
in our 5G devices.

00:10:59.333 --> 00:11:01.684
If we could remove this roughness,

00:11:01.708 --> 00:11:03.559
then we can send the 5G signal

00:11:03.583 --> 00:11:05.601
straight on through uninterrupted.

00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:06.875
Sounds pretty good, right?

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:09.059
But hold on.

00:11:09.083 --> 00:11:11.559
Didn't I just tell you
that we needed that roughness

00:11:11.583 --> 00:11:12.976
to keep the device together?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.976
And if we remove it,
we're in a situation where now the copper

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.334
isn't going to stick
to that underlying substrate.

00:11:19.583 --> 00:11:22.434
Think about building
a house of Lego blocks,

00:11:22.458 --> 00:11:26.684
with all of the nooks and crannies
that latch together,

00:11:26.708 --> 00:11:29.351
as opposed to smooth building blocks.

00:11:29.375 --> 00:11:32.684
Which of the two is going to have
more structural integrity

00:11:32.708 --> 00:11:35.559
when the two-year-old comes
ripping through the living room,

00:11:35.583 --> 00:11:37.917
trying to play Godzilla
and knock everything down?

00:11:39.375 --> 00:11:41.583
But what if we put glue
on those smooth blocks?

00:11:43.125 --> 00:11:45.851
And that's what
the industry is waiting for.

00:11:45.875 --> 00:11:48.976
They're waiting for the chemists
to design new, smooth surfaces

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.518
with increased inherent adhesion

00:11:51.542 --> 00:11:53.583
for some of those copper wires.

00:11:54.457 --> 00:11:55.934
And when we solve this problem,

00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:57.643
and we will solve the problem,

00:11:57.667 --> 00:11:59.893
and we'll work
with physicists and engineers

00:11:59.917 --> 00:12:03.101
to solve all of the challenges of 5G,

00:12:03.125 --> 00:12:06.601
well then the number of applications
is going to skyrocket.

00:12:06.625 --> 00:12:09.518
So yeah, we'll have things
like self-driving cars,

00:12:09.542 --> 00:12:13.184
because now our data networks
can handle the speeds

00:12:13.208 --> 00:12:16.643
and the amount of information
required to make that work.

00:12:16.667 --> 00:12:19.518
But let's start to use imagination.

00:12:19.542 --> 00:12:23.684
I can imagine going into a restaurant
with a friend that has a peanut allergy,

00:12:23.708 --> 00:12:25.476
taking out my phone,

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.851
waving it over the food

00:12:26.875 --> 00:12:29.059
and having the food tell us

00:12:29.083 --> 00:12:32.309
a really important answer to a question --

00:12:32.333 --> 00:12:35.042
deadly or safe to consume?

00:12:35.875 --> 00:12:38.851
Or maybe our devices will get so good

00:12:38.875 --> 00:12:41.893
at processing information about us,

00:12:41.917 --> 00:12:44.893
that they'll become
like our personal trainers.

00:12:44.917 --> 00:12:48.184
And they'll know the most efficient way
for us to burn calories.

00:12:48.208 --> 00:12:49.518
I know come November,

00:12:49.542 --> 00:12:52.309
when I'm trying to burn off
some of these pregnancy pounds,

00:12:52.333 --> 00:12:55.208
I would love a device
that could tell me how to do that.

00:12:56.542 --> 00:12:58.976
I really don't know
another way of saying it,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.143
except chemistry is just cool.

00:13:01.167 --> 00:13:05.018
And it enables all of these
electronic devices.

00:13:05.042 --> 00:13:09.018
So the next time you send a text
or take a selfie,

00:13:09.042 --> 00:13:11.559
think about all those atoms
that are hard at work

00:13:11.583 --> 00:13:13.958
and the innovation that came before them.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.268
Who knows,

00:13:16.292 --> 00:13:18.601
maybe even some of you
listening to this talk,

00:13:18.625 --> 00:13:20.684
perhaps even on your mobile device,

00:13:20.708 --> 00:13:23.143
will decide that you too
want to play sidekick

00:13:23.167 --> 00:13:24.476
to Captain Chemistry,

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:28.309
the true hero of electronic devices.

00:13:28.333 --> 00:13:29.934
Thank you for your attention,

00:13:29.958 --> 00:13:31.559
and thank you chemistry.

00:13:31.583 --> 00:13:34.833
(Applause)
