00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:16.269
People use the internet
for various reasons.

00:00:17.765 --> 00:00:21.569
It turns out that one of the most
popular categories of website

00:00:21.593 --> 00:00:24.465
is something that people
typically consume in private.

00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:28.149
It involves curiosity,

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:31.969
non-insignificant levels
of self-indulgence

00:00:31.993 --> 00:00:35.253
and is centered around recording
the reproductive activities

00:00:35.277 --> 00:00:36.586
of other people.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.642
(Laughter)

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:39.916
Of course, I'm talking about genealogy --

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.154
(Laughter)

00:00:41.178 --> 00:00:42.880
the study of family history.

00:00:43.353 --> 00:00:45.390
When it comes to detailing family history,

00:00:45.414 --> 00:00:49.357
in every family, we have this person
that is obsessed with genealogy.

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.094
Let's call him Uncle Bernie.

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:54.900
Uncle Bernie is exactly the last person
you want to sit next to

00:00:54.924 --> 00:00:56.523
in Thanksgiving dinner,

00:00:56.547 --> 00:00:59.361
because he will bore you to death
with peculiar details

00:00:59.385 --> 00:01:01.351
about some ancient relatives.

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:03.724
But as you know,

00:01:03.748 --> 00:01:06.620
there is a scientific side for everything,

00:01:06.644 --> 00:01:09.622
and we found that Uncle Bernie's stories

00:01:09.646 --> 00:01:12.814
have immense potential
for biomedical research.

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:16.020
We let Uncle Bernie
and his fellow genealogists

00:01:16.044 --> 00:01:20.712
document their family trees through
a genealogy website called geni.com.

00:01:21.198 --> 00:01:23.326
When users upload
their trees to the website,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.040
it scans their relatives,

00:01:25.064 --> 00:01:27.139
and if it finds matches to existing trees,

00:01:27.163 --> 00:01:30.773
it merges the existing
and the new tree together.

00:01:31.768 --> 00:01:34.718
The result is that large
family trees are created,

00:01:34.742 --> 00:01:38.221
beyond the individual level
of each genealogist.

00:01:38.808 --> 00:01:42.937
Now, by repeating this process
with millions of people

00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:44.778
all over the world,

00:01:44.802 --> 00:01:50.334
we can crowdsource the construction
of a family tree of all humankind.

00:01:51.292 --> 00:01:52.876
Using this website,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.713
we were able to connect 125 million people

00:01:57.737 --> 00:02:00.258
into a single family tree.

00:02:00.967 --> 00:02:03.755
I cannot draw the tree
on the screens over here

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:05.944
because they have less pixels

00:02:05.968 --> 00:02:08.481
than the number of people in this tree.

00:02:08.505 --> 00:02:13.515
But here is an example of a subset
of 6,000 individuals.

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.521
Each green node is a person.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.909
The red nodes represent marriages,

00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:22.191
and the connections represent parenthood.

00:02:22.557 --> 00:02:24.929
In the middle of this tree,
you see the ancestors.

00:02:24.953 --> 00:02:27.557
And as we go to the periphery,
you see the descendants.

00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:30.683
This tree has seven
generations, approximately.

00:02:31.692 --> 00:02:34.926
Now, this is what happens
when we increase the number of individuals

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.778
to 70,000 people --

00:02:36.802 --> 00:02:41.132
still a tiny subset
of all the data that we have.

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.442
Despite that, you can already see
the formation of gigantic family trees

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:49.121
with many very distant relatives.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.744
Thanks to the hard work
of our genealogists,

00:02:52.768 --> 00:02:55.871
we can go back in time
hundreds of years ago.

00:02:56.418 --> 00:02:59.859
For example, here is Alexander Hamilton,

00:02:59.883 --> 00:03:02.358
who was born in 1755.

00:03:02.872 --> 00:03:06.636
Alexander was the first
US Secretary of the Treasury,

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.491
but mostly known today
due to a popular Broadway musical.

00:03:11.137 --> 00:03:16.059
We found that Alexander has deeper
connections in the showbiz industry.

00:03:16.083 --> 00:03:18.194
In fact, he's a blood relative of ...

00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:20.001
Kevin Bacon!

00:03:20.025 --> 00:03:22.057
(Laughter)

00:03:22.081 --> 00:03:24.687
Both of them are descendants
of a lady from Scotland

00:03:24.711 --> 00:03:27.025
who lived in the 13th century.

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.151
So you can say that Alexander Hamilton

00:03:30.175 --> 00:03:33.363
is 35 degrees of Kevin Bacon genealogy.

00:03:33.387 --> 00:03:34.828
(Laughter)

00:03:34.852 --> 00:03:38.082
And our tree has millions
of stories like that.

00:03:40.113 --> 00:03:45.003
We invested significant efforts
to validate the quality of our data.

00:03:45.027 --> 00:03:50.418
Using DNA, we found that .3 percent of
the mother-child connections in our data

00:03:50.442 --> 00:03:51.692
are wrong,

00:03:51.716 --> 00:03:55.307
which could match the adoption rate
in the US pre-Second World War.

00:03:56.847 --> 00:03:58.632
For the father's side,

00:03:58.656 --> 00:04:00.617
the news is not as good:

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:07.749
1.9 percent of the father-child
connections in our data are wrong.

00:04:07.773 --> 00:04:10.136
And I see some people smirk over here.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.877
It is what you think --

00:04:11.901 --> 00:04:13.690
there are many milkmen out there.

00:04:13.714 --> 00:04:14.778
(Laughter)

00:04:14.802 --> 00:04:18.791
However, this 1.9 percent error rate
in patrilineal connections

00:04:18.815 --> 00:04:20.584
is not unique to our data.

00:04:20.608 --> 00:04:23.677
Previous studies found
a similar error rate

00:04:23.701 --> 00:04:25.722
using clinical-grade pedigrees.

00:04:26.254 --> 00:04:28.779
So the quality of our data is good,

00:04:28.803 --> 00:04:30.936
and that should not be a surprise.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.736
Our genealogists have
a profound, vested interest

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.428
in correctly documenting
their family history.

00:04:40.594 --> 00:04:45.185
We can leverage this data to learn
quantitative information about humanity,

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:47.805
for example, questions about demography.

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:51.686
Here is a look at all our profiles
on the map of the world.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.731
Each pixel is a person
that lived at some point.

00:04:56.755 --> 00:04:58.435
And since we have so much data,

00:04:58.459 --> 00:05:01.240
you can see the contours
of many countries,

00:05:01.264 --> 00:05:03.363
especially in the Western world.

00:05:03.387 --> 00:05:06.935
In this clip, we stratified
the map that I've showed you

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:12.031
based on the year of births of individuals
from 1400 to 1900,

00:05:12.055 --> 00:05:14.821
and we compared it
to known migration events.

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:18.647
The clip is going to show you
that the deepest lineages in our data

00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:20.298
go all the way back to the UK,

00:05:20.322 --> 00:05:22.130
where they had better record keeping,

00:05:22.154 --> 00:05:25.436
and then they spread along
the routes of Western colonialism.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.782
Let's watch this.

00:05:27.143 --> 00:05:28.752
(Music)

00:05:28.776 --> 00:05:31.117
[Year of birth: ]

00:05:31.705 --> 00:05:33.541
[1492 - Columbus sails the ocean blue]

00:05:35.661 --> 00:05:37.661
[1620 - Mayflower lands in Massachusetts]

00:05:38.726 --> 00:05:40.501
[1652 - Dutch settle in South Africa]

[1788 - Great Britain penal

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:53.332
[all activity]

00:05:55.851 --> 00:05:57.394
I love this movie.

00:05:57.418 --> 00:06:02.511
Now, since these migration events
are giving the context of families,

00:06:02.535 --> 00:06:04.718
we can ask questions such as:

00:06:04.742 --> 00:06:08.212
What is the typical distance
between the birth locations

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:11.048
of husbands and wives?

00:06:11.072 --> 00:06:14.749
This distance plays
a pivotal role in demography,

00:06:14.773 --> 00:06:18.454
because the patterns in which
people migrate to form families

00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:22.191
determine how genes spread
in geographical areas.

00:06:22.706 --> 00:06:25.034
We analyzed this distance using our data,

00:06:25.058 --> 00:06:27.348
and we found that in the old days,

00:06:27.372 --> 00:06:28.602
people had it easy.

00:06:28.626 --> 00:06:31.220
They just married someone
in the village nearby.

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.663
But the Industrial Revolution
really complicated our love life.

00:06:35.687 --> 00:06:40.247
And today, with affordable flights
and online social media,

00:06:40.271 --> 00:06:45.099
people typically migrate more than
100 kilometers from their place of birth

00:06:45.123 --> 00:06:46.627
to find their soul mate.

00:06:48.524 --> 00:06:49.711
So now you might ask:

00:06:49.735 --> 00:06:54.231
OK, but who does the hard work
of migrating from places to places

00:06:54.255 --> 00:06:55.524
to form families?

00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:59.275
Are these the males or the females?

00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:01.907
We used our data to address this question,

00:07:01.931 --> 00:07:04.525
and at least in the last 300 years,

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:08.432
we found that the ladies do the hard work

00:07:08.456 --> 00:07:11.452
of migrating from places
to places to form families.

00:07:11.476 --> 00:07:14.577
Now, these results
are statistically significant,

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:18.072
so you can take it as scientific fact
that males are lazy.

00:07:18.096 --> 00:07:21.252
(Laughter)

00:07:21.276 --> 00:07:23.812
We can move from questions
about demography

00:07:23.836 --> 00:07:26.749
and ask questions about human health.

00:07:26.773 --> 00:07:28.260
For example, we can ask

00:07:28.284 --> 00:07:33.247
to what extent genetic variations
account for differences in life span

00:07:33.271 --> 00:07:34.465
between individuals.

00:07:34.988 --> 00:07:39.518
Previous studies analyzed the correlation
of longevity between twins

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:40.984
to address this question.

00:07:41.411 --> 00:07:44.078
They estimated that the genetic
variations account for

00:07:44.102 --> 00:07:48.142
about a quarter of the differences
in life span between individuals.

00:07:48.688 --> 00:07:51.286
But twins can be correlated
due to so many reasons,

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.614
including various environmental effects

00:07:53.638 --> 00:07:55.260
or a shared household.

00:07:56.411 --> 00:08:00.164
Large family trees give us the opportunity
to analyze both close relatives,

00:08:00.188 --> 00:08:01.395
such as twins,

00:08:01.419 --> 00:08:04.336
all the way to distant relatives,
even fourth cousins.

00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:07.438
This way we can build robust models

00:08:07.462 --> 00:08:11.170
that can tease apart the contribution
of genetic variations

00:08:11.194 --> 00:08:12.911
from environmental factors.

00:08:13.379 --> 00:08:16.278
We conducted this analysis using our data,

00:08:16.302 --> 00:08:22.093
and we found that genetic variations
explain only 15 percent

00:08:22.117 --> 00:08:24.923
of the differences in life span
between individuals.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.516
That is five years, on average.

00:08:30.316 --> 00:08:35.024
So genes matter less than
what we thought before to life span.

00:08:35.675 --> 00:08:37.811
And I find it great news,

00:08:38.438 --> 00:08:41.731
because it means that
our actions can matter more.

00:08:42.533 --> 00:08:46.807
Smoking, for example, determines
10 years of our life expectancy --

00:08:46.831 --> 00:08:49.477
twice as much as what genetics determines.

00:08:50.236 --> 00:08:52.525
We can even have more surprising findings

00:08:52.549 --> 00:08:54.041
as we move from family trees

00:08:54.065 --> 00:08:58.797
and we let our genealogists
document and crowdsource DNA information.

00:08:58.821 --> 00:09:00.845
And the results can be amazing.

00:09:01.255 --> 00:09:05.170
It might be hard to imagine,
but Uncle Bernie and his friends

00:09:05.194 --> 00:09:07.840
can create DNA forensic capabilities

00:09:07.864 --> 00:09:11.423
that even exceed
what the FBI currently has.

00:09:12.862 --> 00:09:15.266
When you place the DNA
on a large family tree,

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.407
you effectively create a beacon

00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:20.065
that illuminates the hundreds
of distant relatives

00:09:20.089 --> 00:09:23.579
that are all connected to the person
that originated the DNA.

00:09:24.505 --> 00:09:27.418
By placing multiple beacons
on a large family tree,

00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:31.162
you can now triangulate the DNA
of an unknown person,

00:09:31.186 --> 00:09:35.124
the same way that the GPS system
uses multiple satellites

00:09:35.148 --> 00:09:36.472
to find a location.

00:09:37.226 --> 00:09:40.850
The prime example
of the power of this technique

00:09:40.874 --> 00:09:43.549
is capturing the Golden State Killer,

00:09:44.612 --> 00:09:49.140
one of the most notorious criminals
in the history of the US.

00:09:49.164 --> 00:09:55.056
The FBI had been searching
for this person for over 40 years.

00:09:55.588 --> 00:09:57.423
They had his DNA,

00:09:57.447 --> 00:10:00.797
but he never showed up
in any police database.

00:10:01.447 --> 00:10:06.159
About a year ago, the FBI
consulted a genetic genealogist,

00:10:06.183 --> 00:10:10.133
and she suggested that they submit
his DNA to a genealogy service

00:10:10.157 --> 00:10:12.555
that can locate distant relatives.

00:10:13.117 --> 00:10:14.273
They did that,

00:10:14.297 --> 00:10:17.989
and they found a third cousin
of the Golden State Killer.

00:10:18.013 --> 00:10:20.357
They built a large family tree,

00:10:20.381 --> 00:10:22.483
scanned the different
branches of that tree,

00:10:22.507 --> 00:10:25.072
until they found a profile
that exactly matched

00:10:25.096 --> 00:10:27.677
what they knew about
the Golden State Killer.

00:10:27.701 --> 00:10:31.293
They obtained DNA from this person
and found a perfect match

00:10:31.317 --> 00:10:33.342
to the DNA they had in hand.

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:35.716
They arrested him
and brought him to justice

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.164
after all these years.

00:10:38.172 --> 00:10:41.413
Since then, genetic genealogists
have started working with

00:10:41.437 --> 00:10:44.105
local US law enforcement agencies

00:10:44.129 --> 00:10:47.491
to use this technique
in order to capture criminals.

00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:50.202
And only in the past six months,

00:10:50.226 --> 00:10:54.522
they were able to solve
over 20 cold cases with this technique.

00:10:56.203 --> 00:11:00.839
Luckily, we have people like Uncle
Bernie and his fellow genealogists

00:11:01.045 --> 00:11:04.039
These are not amateurs
with a self-serving hobby.

00:11:04.602 --> 00:11:11.021
These are citizen scientists
with a deep passion to tell us who we are.

00:11:11.065 --> 00:11:15.523
And they know that the past
can hold a key to the future.

00:11:16.067 --> 00:11:17.250
Thank you very much.

00:11:17.314 --> 00:11:20.783
