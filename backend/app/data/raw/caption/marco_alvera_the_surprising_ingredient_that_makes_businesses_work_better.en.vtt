00:00:13.087 --> 00:00:16.507
For me, it was not being invited
to a friend's wedding.

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:19.334
At first, I didn't really mind.

00:00:19.358 --> 00:00:22.020
I thought he was having a small reception.

00:00:22.044 --> 00:00:25.497
But then I kept meeting people
who were going to the same wedding,

00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:27.965
and they weren't as close
to the groom as I was ...

00:00:29.192 --> 00:00:30.679
and I felt left out.

00:00:30.703 --> 00:00:31.989
That really sucked.

00:00:32.013 --> 00:00:33.552
It felt really unfair.

00:00:34.813 --> 00:00:39.312
For my daughters, Lipsi
and Greta, it was last week.

00:00:40.124 --> 00:00:42.702
They were taking turns
massaging their mom's back

00:00:42.726 --> 00:00:44.814
with a toy for back rubs,

00:00:44.838 --> 00:00:48.130
and then one of the girls felt
that the other girl had a longer go.

00:00:48.604 --> 00:00:50.411
That's when I walk into the room

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:53.685
to find Greta in a rage,
shouting, "That's not fair!"

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:55.674
and Lipsi in tears,

00:00:55.698 --> 00:00:57.656
and my wife holding a stopwatch

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.158
to make sure that each girl
had precisely one minute on the toy.

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:08.740
So if you're anything like me or my girls,

00:01:08.764 --> 00:01:11.471
the last thing that upset you

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:13.764
probably also had to do with unfairness.

00:01:14.756 --> 00:01:18.288
That's because unfairness
triggers us so strongly

00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:19.820
that we can't think straight.

00:01:20.446 --> 00:01:22.469
We become afraid and suspicious.

00:01:23.826 --> 00:01:25.938
Our unfairness antennae stick up.

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:29.438
We feel pain, and we walk away.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.290
Unfairness is one of the defining
issues of our society,

00:01:34.314 --> 00:01:37.450
it's one of the root causes
of polarization,

00:01:37.474 --> 00:01:39.137
and it's bad news for business.

00:01:40.477 --> 00:01:44.589
At work, unfairness makes people
defensive and disengaged.

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:52.380
A study shows that 70 percent
of workers in the US are disengaged,

00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:54.016
and this is costing the companies

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.552
550 billion dollars a year every year.

00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:02.917
This is, like, half the total
spent on education in the US.

00:02:03.476 --> 00:02:06.041
This is the size of the GDP
of a country like Austria.

00:02:08.255 --> 00:02:11.582
So removing unfairness
and promoting fairness

00:02:11.606 --> 00:02:12.811
should be our priority.

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:15.741
But what does it mean in practice?

00:02:15.765 --> 00:02:18.716
Is it about more rules?
Is it about systems?

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.496
Is it about equality?

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.932
Well, partly, but fairness is more
interesting than rules and equality.

00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:27.677
Fairness works in surprising ways.

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:33.757
15 years ago, I left a US investment bank

00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:38.678
to join a large Italian
state-owned oil company.

00:02:38.702 --> 00:02:39.955
It was a different world.

00:02:40.487 --> 00:02:42.835
I thought the key to getting
the best performance

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.757
was a risk-reward system

00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:48.964
where you could give the high performers
bonuses and promotions

00:02:48.988 --> 00:02:51.591
and give the underperformers
something to worry about.

00:02:52.435 --> 00:02:56.442
But in this company, we had fixed salaries

00:02:56.466 --> 00:02:57.656
and lifelong jobs.

00:02:58.903 --> 00:03:00.382
Careers were set,

00:03:00.406 --> 00:03:02.840
so my toolkit wasn't very effective,

00:03:02.864 --> 00:03:04.116
and I was frustrated.

00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:10.058
But then I saw that this company
was producing some pockets of excellence,

00:03:10.082 --> 00:03:12.201
areas in which they beat the competition

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:14.646
in very tough, competitive sectors.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.384
This was true in trading,

00:03:16.408 --> 00:03:18.527
in project management --

00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:20.400
it was very true in exploration.

00:03:20.926 --> 00:03:24.195
Our exploration team
was finding more oil and gas

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:26.098
than any other company in the world.

00:03:26.878 --> 00:03:28.028
It was a phenomenon.

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:31.537
Everyone was trying
to figure out how this was possible.

00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:33.778
I thought it was luck,

00:03:33.802 --> 00:03:37.651
but after each new discovery,
that became less and less likely.

00:03:38.215 --> 00:03:41.500
So did we have a special tool? No.

00:03:42.635 --> 00:03:45.721
Did we have a killer application
that no one else had? No.

00:03:46.844 --> 00:03:50.095
Was it one genius who was finding oil
for the whole team?

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:52.547
No, we hadn't hired a senior guy in years.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.658
So what was our secret sauce?

00:03:57.723 --> 00:03:59.845
I started looking at them
really carefully.

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:01.256
I looked at my friend,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.686
who drilled seven dry wells,

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.495
writing off more than a billion
dollars for the company,

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.200
and found oil on the eighth.

00:04:08.865 --> 00:04:10.190
I was nervous for him ...

00:04:12.491 --> 00:04:14.047
but he was so relaxed.

00:04:14.611 --> 00:04:16.891
I mean, these guys
knew what they were doing.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.338
And then it hit me: it was about fairness.

00:04:21.502 --> 00:04:23.217
These guys were working in a company

00:04:23.241 --> 00:04:26.036
where they didn't need to worry
about short-term results.

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.063
They weren't going to be penalized
for bad luck or for an honest mistake.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.762
They knew they were valued
for what they were trying to do,

00:04:34.786 --> 00:04:36.032
not the outcome.

00:04:36.056 --> 00:04:39.056
They were valued as human beings.
They were part of a community.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.691
Whatever happened,
the company would stand by them.

00:04:41.715 --> 00:04:44.688
And for me, this is
the definition of fairness.

00:04:44.712 --> 00:04:48.513
It's when you can lower those
unfairness antennae, put them at rest.

00:04:48.537 --> 00:04:49.968
Then great things follow.

00:04:50.376 --> 00:04:54.097
These guys could be true to their purpose,
which was finding oil and gas.

00:04:54.645 --> 00:04:58.248
They didn't have to worry
about company politics or greed or fear.

00:04:59.814 --> 00:05:02.339
They could be good risk-takers,

00:05:02.363 --> 00:05:04.862
because they weren't too defensive

00:05:04.886 --> 00:05:07.592
and they weren't gambling
to take huge rewards.

00:05:08.583 --> 00:05:11.059
And they were excellent team workers.

00:05:11.528 --> 00:05:13.149
They could trust their colleagues.

00:05:13.173 --> 00:05:15.313
They didn't need to look
behind their backs.

00:05:16.293 --> 00:05:18.627
And they were basically having fun.

00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.452
They were having so much fun,

00:05:20.476 --> 00:05:22.660
one guy even confessed

00:05:22.684 --> 00:05:26.034
that he was having more fun
at the company Christmas dinner

00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:27.866
than at his own Christmas dinner.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.111
(Laughter)

00:05:30.135 --> 00:05:35.216
But these guys, essentially,
were working in a fair system

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.802
where they could do
what they felt was right

00:05:37.826 --> 00:05:40.636
instead of what's selfish,
what's quick, what's convenient,

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.537
and to be able to do what we feel is right

00:05:43.561 --> 00:05:47.457
is a key ingredient for fairness,
but it is also a great motivator.

00:05:49.187 --> 00:05:52.084
And it wasn't just explorers
who were doing the right thing.

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:58.723
There was an HR director who proposed
that I hire someone internally

00:05:58.747 --> 00:06:00.661
and give him a managerial job.

00:06:00.685 --> 00:06:03.502
This guy was very good,
but he didn't finish high school,

00:06:03.526 --> 00:06:05.780
so formally, he had no qualifications.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.725
But he was so good, it made sense,
and so we gave him the job.

00:06:10.451 --> 00:06:15.325
Or the other guy, who asked me
for a budget to build a cheese factory

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:18.931
next to our plant in Ecuador,
in the village.

00:06:18.955 --> 00:06:21.813
It didn't make any sense:
no one ever built a cheese factory.

00:06:21.837 --> 00:06:25.399
But this is what the village wanted,
because the milk they had would spoil

00:06:25.423 --> 00:06:28.018
before they could sell it,
so that's what they needed.

00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:29.646
And so we built it.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.654
So in these examples and many others,

00:06:31.678 --> 00:06:34.654
I learned that to be fair,

00:06:34.678 --> 00:06:38.259
my colleagues and I, we needed
to take a risk and stick our head out,

00:06:38.283 --> 00:06:40.162
but in a fair system, you can do that.

00:06:40.186 --> 00:06:41.397
You can dare to be fair.

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:46.951
So I realized that these guys
and other colleagues

00:06:46.975 --> 00:06:51.872
were achieving great results,
doing great things,

00:06:51.896 --> 00:06:53.856
in a way that no bonus could buy.

00:06:54.716 --> 00:06:55.955
So I was fascinated.

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:58.170
I wanted to learn
how this thing really worked,

00:06:58.194 --> 00:07:01.791
and I wanted to learn it also for myself,
to become a better leader.

00:07:01.815 --> 00:07:04.644
So I started talking
to colleagues, to coaches,

00:07:04.668 --> 00:07:07.170
to headhunters and neuroscientists,

00:07:07.194 --> 00:07:08.786
and what I discovered

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.936
is that what these guys were up to
and the way they worked

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.681
is really supported
by recent brain science.

00:07:15.263 --> 00:07:18.628
And I've also discovered
that this can work at all levels

00:07:18.652 --> 00:07:19.882
in any type of company.

00:07:19.906 --> 00:07:23.310
You don't need the fixed salaries
or the stable careers.

00:07:24.254 --> 00:07:27.803
This is because science shows

00:07:27.827 --> 00:07:31.794
that humans have
an innate sense of fairness.

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:35.841
We know what is right and what is wrong

00:07:35.865 --> 00:07:37.793
before we can talk or think about it.

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:41.468
My favorite experiment

00:07:41.492 --> 00:07:44.221
has six-month old babies

00:07:44.245 --> 00:07:48.054
watching a ball
trying to struggle up a hill.

00:07:48.943 --> 00:07:52.970
And there's a helpful, friendly square
that pushes the ball up the hill,

00:07:52.994 --> 00:07:56.239
and then a mean triangle
pushes the ball back down.

00:07:57.042 --> 00:07:59.424
After watching this several times,

00:07:59.448 --> 00:08:01.518
they ask the babies to pick,

00:08:01.542 --> 00:08:02.884
to choose what to play with.

00:08:02.908 --> 00:08:06.201
They can pick a ball,
a square or a triangle.

00:08:07.265 --> 00:08:09.456
They never pick up the triangle.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.344
All the babies want to be the square.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.662
And science also shows

00:08:15.686 --> 00:08:18.448
that when we see or perceive fairness,

00:08:18.472 --> 00:08:22.165
our brain releases a substance
that gives us pleasure,

00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:23.339
proper joy.

00:08:24.225 --> 00:08:27.177
But when we perceive
unfairness, we feel pain ...

00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:29.805
even greater pain

00:08:29.829 --> 00:08:32.446
than the same type of pain
as if I really hurt myself.

00:08:33.275 --> 00:08:37.411
That's because unfairness triggers
the primitive, reptile part of our brain,

00:08:37.435 --> 00:08:40.917
the part that deals
with threats and survival,

00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:44.449
and when unfairness triggers a threat,
that's all we can think about.

00:08:44.473 --> 00:08:47.497
Motivation, creativity, teamwork,

00:08:47.521 --> 00:08:49.044
they all go way back.

00:08:50.119 --> 00:08:52.302
And it makes sense
that we're wired this way,

00:08:52.326 --> 00:08:53.841
because we're social animals.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.484
We need to be part
of a community to survive.

00:08:58.134 --> 00:09:00.222
We're born so helpless

00:09:00.246 --> 00:09:03.452
that someone needs to look after us
until we're maybe 10 years old,

00:09:03.476 --> 00:09:05.722
so our brain evolves towards food.

00:09:05.746 --> 00:09:07.635
We need to be in that community.

00:09:07.659 --> 00:09:10.236
So whether I like it or not,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.130
not being invited to the friend's wedding,

00:09:13.154 --> 00:09:16.147
my lizard brain is generating
the same response

00:09:16.171 --> 00:09:19.019
as if I'm about to be pushed out
from my community.

00:09:20.763 --> 00:09:25.065
So science explains quite nicely
why fairness is good

00:09:25.089 --> 00:09:27.462
and why unfairness
makes us really defensive,

00:09:27.486 --> 00:09:31.001
but science also shows
that in a fair environment,

00:09:31.025 --> 00:09:34.100
not only do we all want to be the square,

00:09:34.124 --> 00:09:36.209
but we tend to be the square,

00:09:36.233 --> 00:09:39.734
and this allows other people
to be fair in turn.

00:09:39.758 --> 00:09:42.264
This creates a beautiful fairness circle.

00:09:43.934 --> 00:09:45.616
But while we start off fair ...

00:09:46.934 --> 00:09:51.997
one drop of unfairness
contaminates the whole pool,

00:09:52.021 --> 00:09:55.140
and unfortunately,
there's plenty of drops in that pool.

00:09:56.606 --> 00:10:00.567
So our effort should be to filter out

00:10:00.591 --> 00:10:02.687
as much unfairness
as we can from everywhere,

00:10:02.711 --> 00:10:05.473
starting from our communities,
starting from our companies.

00:10:06.687 --> 00:10:12.235
I worry about this a lot because I lead
a team of 3,000 excellent people,

00:10:12.259 --> 00:10:16.529
and the difference between
3,000 happy, motivated team workers

00:10:16.553 --> 00:10:19.536
and 3,000 clock-watchers is everything.

00:10:21.154 --> 00:10:26.507
So the first thing I try to do
in my fairness crusade

00:10:26.531 --> 00:10:29.877
is to try to take myself
out of the equation.

00:10:29.901 --> 00:10:31.997
That means being aware of my own biases.

00:10:32.021 --> 00:10:34.671
For example, I really like
people who say yes

00:10:34.695 --> 00:10:35.933
to whatever I suggest.

00:10:35.957 --> 00:10:37.302
(Laughter)

00:10:37.326 --> 00:10:39.354
But that's not very good for the company

00:10:39.378 --> 00:10:41.856
and not very good
for anyone who has different ideas.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.120
So we try to actively promote
a culture of diversity of opinions

00:10:46.144 --> 00:10:47.829
and diversity of character.

00:10:47.853 --> 00:10:50.235
The second thing we do
is a little more procedural.

00:10:50.259 --> 00:10:53.963
We look at all the rules, the processes,
the systems in the company,

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:57.583
the ones we use to take decisions
and allocate resources,

00:10:57.607 --> 00:11:00.970
and we try to get rid
of anything that's not very clear,

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:02.844
not very rational, doesn't make sense,

00:11:02.868 --> 00:11:05.179
and we also try to fix
anything that's limiting

00:11:05.203 --> 00:11:07.866
the transfer of information
within the company.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.178
We then look at the culture
and the motivation for the same reasons.

00:11:11.202 --> 00:11:13.917
But my point is that however hard
you look at the rules,

00:11:13.941 --> 00:11:16.564
the processes, the systems --
and we have to do that --

00:11:16.588 --> 00:11:18.258
but however hard we look,

00:11:18.282 --> 00:11:21.742
we're never going to do enough
to get to the real essence of fairness.

00:11:21.766 --> 00:11:25.924
That's because the last mile of fairness
requires something else.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.600
It's about what people's emotions are,

00:11:29.624 --> 00:11:31.187
what their needs are,

00:11:31.211 --> 00:11:33.830
what's going on in their private lives,

00:11:33.854 --> 00:11:35.289
what society needs.

00:11:36.994 --> 00:11:39.757
These are all questions and elements

00:11:39.781 --> 00:11:43.631
that are very hard to put
into a spreadsheet, into an algorithm.

00:11:43.655 --> 00:11:46.878
It's very hard to make them
part of our rational decision.

00:11:46.902 --> 00:11:50.538
But if we miss these,
we're missing key important points,

00:11:50.562 --> 00:11:52.861
and the outcome is likely to feel unfair.

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.347
So we should cross-check our decisions
with our fairness center switched on.

00:11:59.502 --> 00:12:02.858
Is it right that this guy should get
the job he's really hoping to get?

00:12:03.414 --> 00:12:05.716
Is it right that this guy should be fired?

00:12:07.273 --> 00:12:10.471
Is it right that we should be charging
so much for this product?

00:12:12.129 --> 00:12:13.629
These are tough questions.

00:12:15.241 --> 00:12:19.122
But if we take the time to ask ourselves

00:12:19.146 --> 00:12:23.248
whether the rational answer
is the right one ...

00:12:24.529 --> 00:12:27.386
we all know deep inside
what the answer is.

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:29.021
We've known since we were babies.

00:12:30.975 --> 00:12:33.315
And to know what the right answer is

00:12:33.339 --> 00:12:35.227
is pretty cool for decision-making.

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:39.847
And if we turn on our hearts,

00:12:39.871 --> 00:12:42.514
that's the key to getting
the real best out of people,

00:12:42.538 --> 00:12:45.181
because they can smell it if you care,

00:12:45.205 --> 00:12:48.302
and only when you really care
will they leave their fears behind

00:12:48.326 --> 00:12:50.133
and bring their true selves to work.

00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:54.340
So if fairness is a keystone of life,

00:12:54.364 --> 00:12:57.291
why isn't every leader
making it their priority?

00:12:58.019 --> 00:13:00.947
Wouldn't it be cool to work
in a company that was more fair?

00:13:02.492 --> 00:13:05.067
Wouldn't it be great to have
colleagues and bosses

00:13:05.091 --> 00:13:09.183
that were selected and trained
for fairness and for character

00:13:09.207 --> 00:13:11.440
and not based on 60-year-old GMATs?

00:13:13.225 --> 00:13:15.630
Wouldn't it be nice to be able
to knock on the door

00:13:15.654 --> 00:13:17.375
of a Chief Fairness Officer?

00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:20.899
We'll get there,
but why is it not happening now?

00:13:21.502 --> 00:13:23.837
Well, partly, it's because of inertia,

00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:27.018
partly, it's because fairness
isn't always easy.

00:13:27.042 --> 00:13:28.843
It requires judgment and risk.

00:13:29.741 --> 00:13:32.241
Drilling that eighth well was a risk.

00:13:33.336 --> 00:13:36.415
Promoting the guy who didn't finish
high school was a risk.

00:13:37.164 --> 00:13:39.997
Building a cheese factory
in Ecuador was a risk.

00:13:41.354 --> 00:13:45.173
But fairness is a risk worth taking,

00:13:45.197 --> 00:13:47.753
so we should be asking ourselves,

00:13:47.777 --> 00:13:50.093
where can we take this risk?

00:13:51.031 --> 00:13:55.278
Where can we push ourselves
a little bit further,

00:13:55.302 --> 00:13:58.261
to go beyond what's rational
and do what's right?

00:13:59.865 --> 00:14:01.016
Thank you.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:06.658
(Applause)
