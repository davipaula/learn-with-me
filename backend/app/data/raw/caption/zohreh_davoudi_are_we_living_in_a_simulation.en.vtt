00:00:07.837 --> 00:00:11.207
We live in a vast universe, 
on a small wet planet,

00:00:11.207 --> 00:00:12.677
where billions of years ago

00:00:12.677 --> 00:00:16.017
single-celled life forms evolved
from the same elements

00:00:16.017 --> 00:00:18.722
as all non-living material 
around them,

00:00:18.722 --> 00:00:23.312
proliferating and radiating into an 
incredible ray of complex life forms.

00:00:23.312 --> 00:00:27.242
All of this— living and inanimate, 
microscopic and cosmic—

00:00:27.242 --> 00:00:31.402
is governed by mathematical laws with 
apparently arbitrary constants.

00:00:31.402 --> 00:00:33.313
And this opens up a question:

00:00:33.313 --> 00:00:36.263
If the universe is completely governed 
by these laws,

00:00:36.263 --> 00:00:39.853
couldn’t a powerful enough computer 
simulate it exactly?

00:00:39.853 --> 00:00:43.853
Could our reality actually be an 
incredibly detailed simulation

00:00:43.853 --> 00:00:47.243
set in place by a much more 
advanced civilization?

00:00:47.243 --> 00:00:49.453
This idea may sound like science fiction,

00:00:49.453 --> 00:00:51.933
but it has been the subject 
of serious inquiry.

00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:55.023
Philosopher Nick Bostrom advanced 
a compelling argument

00:00:55.023 --> 00:00:57.313
that we’re likely living in a simulation,

00:00:57.313 --> 00:01:00.203
and some scientists also think 
it’s a possibility.

00:01:00.203 --> 00:01:03.323
These scientists have started thinking 
about experimental tests

00:01:03.323 --> 00:01:06.463
to find out whether our 
universe is a simulation.

00:01:06.463 --> 00:01:10.663
They are hypothesizing about what the 
constraints of the simulation might be,

00:01:10.663 --> 00:01:14.732
and how those constraints could lead 
to detectable signs in the world.

00:01:14.732 --> 00:01:17.409
So where might we look for those glitches?

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.109
One idea is that as a simulation runs,

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:22.749
it might accumulate errors over time.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.169
To correct for these errors

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:27.739
the simulators could adjust the constants
in the laws of nature.

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:29.419
These shifts could be tiny—

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:30.259
for instance,

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.889
certain constants we’ve measured 
with accuracies of parts per million

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:35.569
have stayed steady for decades,

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:39.189
so any drift would have to be 
on an even smaller scale.

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.479
But as we gain more precision in our 
measurements of these constants,

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.419
we might detect slight changes over time.

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:49.769
Another possible place to look comes from 
the concept that finite computing power,

00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:53.119
no matter how huge, 
can’t simulate infinities.

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.962
If space and time are continuous,

00:01:54.962 --> 00:01:58.402
then even a tiny piece of the universe 
has infinite points

00:01:58.402 --> 00:02:02.092
and becomes impossible to simulate 
with finite computing power.

00:02:02.092 --> 00:02:07.212
So a simulation would have to represent 
space and time in very small pieces.

00:02:07.212 --> 00:02:09.980
These would be almost 
incomprehensibly tiny.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.840
But we might be able to search for them

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.160
by using certain subatomic 
particles as probes.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.500
The basic principle is this: 
the smaller something is,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.910
the more sensitive it will 
be to disruption—

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.200
think of hitting a pothole on a skateboard
versus in a truck.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.870
Any unit in space-time would be so small

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.810
that most things would travel through it 
without disruption—

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.870
not just objects large enough to be 
visible to the naked eye,

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.450
but also molecules, atoms, 
and even electrons

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.750
and most of the other subatomic 
particles we’ve discovered.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.060
If we do discover a tiny unit in 
space-time

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.690
or a shifting constant in a natural law,

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.360
would that prove the universe 
is a simulation?

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.280
No— it would only be the 
first of many steps.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.210
There could be other explanations 
for each of those findings.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.990
And a lot more evidence would be needed 
to establish the simulation hypothesis

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.140
as a working theory of nature.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.780
However many tests we design,

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.780
we’re limited by some assumptions 
they all share.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.460
Our current understanding of the natural 
world on the quantum level

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.390
breaks down at what’s known 
as the planck scale.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.040
If the unit of space-time is 
on this scale,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.760
we wouldn’t be able to look for it 
with our current scientific understanding.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.500
There’s still a wide range of things

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.840
that are smaller than what’s 
currently observable

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.790
but larger than the planck 
scale to investigate.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.410
Similarly, shifts in the constants of 
natural laws could occur so slowly

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.762
that they would only be observable 
over the lifetime of the universe.

00:03:32.762 --> 00:03:35.142
So they could exist even if we don’t 
detect them

00:03:35.142 --> 00:03:38.092
over centuries or millennia 
of measurements.

00:03:38.092 --> 00:03:42.482
We're also biased towards thinking that 
our universe’s simulator, if it exists,

00:03:42.482 --> 00:03:44.772
makes calculations the same way we do,

00:03:44.772 --> 00:03:47.362
with similar computational limitations.

00:03:47.362 --> 00:03:49.052
Really, we have no way of knowing

00:03:49.052 --> 00:03:52.452
what an alien civilization’s constraints 
and methods would be—

00:03:52.452 --> 00:03:54.382
but we have to start somewhere.

00:03:54.382 --> 00:03:58.362
It may never be possible to prove 
conclusively that the universe either is,

00:03:58.362 --> 00:04:00.256
or isn’t, a simulation,

00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:03.066
but we’ll always be pushing science and 
technology forward

00:04:03.066 --> 00:04:04.746
in pursuit of the question:

00:04:04.746 --> 00:04:07.306
what is the nature of reality?
