00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:15.928
We do not choose where to be born.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.215
We do not choose who our parents are.

00:00:21.264 --> 00:00:25.499
But we do choose how we are going
to live our lives.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.527
I did not choose to be born
in South Sudan,

00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:31.687
a country rife with conflict.

00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:34.534
I did not choose my name --

00:00:35.304 --> 00:00:36.842
Nyiriak,

00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.348
which means "war."

00:00:39.308 --> 00:00:41.271
I've always rejected it

00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:44.730
and all the legacy it was born into.

00:00:44.754 --> 00:00:46.973
I choose to be called Mary.

00:00:48.154 --> 00:00:51.837
As a teacher, I've stood
in front of 120 students,

00:00:51.861 --> 00:00:54.860
so this stage does not intimidate me.

00:00:55.996 --> 00:00:59.545
My students come from war-torn countries.

00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:02.638
They're so different from each other,

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:05.480
but they have one thing in common:

00:01:05.504 --> 00:01:09.369
they fled their homes
in order to stay alive.

00:01:10.616 --> 00:01:14.127
Some of them belong to parents
back home in South Sudan

00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:15.473
who are killing each other

00:01:15.497 --> 00:01:19.947
because they belong to a different tribe
or they have a different belief.

00:01:20.922 --> 00:01:25.209
Others come from other African countries
devastated by war.

00:01:25.823 --> 00:01:28.858
But when they enter my class,
they make friends,

00:01:28.882 --> 00:01:30.519
they walk home together,

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.050
they do their homework together.

00:01:33.711 --> 00:01:36.739
There is no hatred allowed in my class.

00:01:38.078 --> 00:01:42.211
My story is like that
of so many other refugees.

00:01:43.063 --> 00:01:45.137
The war came when I was still a baby.

00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:47.348
And my father,

00:01:47.372 --> 00:01:50.227
who had been absent
in most of my early childhood,

00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:52.827
was doing what other men were doing:

00:01:52.851 --> 00:01:54.578
fighting for the country.

00:01:55.283 --> 00:01:58.403
He had two wives and many children.

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.788
My mother was his second wife,

00:02:02.812 --> 00:02:05.091
married to him at the age of 16.

00:02:05.588 --> 00:02:09.610
This is simply because my mother
came from a poor background,

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:12.079
and she had no choice.

00:02:12.103 --> 00:02:15.045
My father, on the other hand, was rich.

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.402
He had many cows.

00:02:18.987 --> 00:02:22.174
Gunshots were the order of the day.

00:02:24.713 --> 00:02:27.605
My community was constantly under attack.

00:02:28.526 --> 00:02:33.166
Communities would fight each other
as they took water along the Nile.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.482
But that was not all.

00:02:35.257 --> 00:02:39.161
Planes would drop the spinning
and terrifying bombs

00:02:39.185 --> 00:02:41.411
that chopped off people's limbs.

00:02:41.435 --> 00:02:44.711
But the most terrifying thing
for every single parent

00:02:44.735 --> 00:02:50.949
was to see their children being abducted
and turned into young soldiers.

00:02:51.877 --> 00:02:54.198
My mother dug a trench

00:02:54.222 --> 00:02:56.371
that soon became our home.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.503
But yet, we did not feel protected.

00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:04.405
She had to flee in search
of a safe place for us.

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:07.851
I was four years old,
and my younger sister was two.

00:03:09.267 --> 00:03:11.280
We joined a huge mass of people,

00:03:11.304 --> 00:03:15.220
and together we walked
for many agonizing days

00:03:15.244 --> 00:03:17.166
in search of a secure place.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.863
But we could barely rest

00:03:19.954 --> 00:03:22.863
before we were attacked again.

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.603
I remember my mother was pregnant,

00:03:26.627 --> 00:03:29.678
when she would take turns
to carry me and my younger sister.

00:03:30.362 --> 00:03:33.236
We finally made it across
the Kenyan border, yes.

00:03:33.887 --> 00:03:39.034
But that was the longest journey
that I have ever had in my whole life.

00:03:40.028 --> 00:03:43.551
My feet were raw with blisters.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.186
To our surprise,

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.521
we found other family members
who had fled into the camp earlier on,

00:03:50.545 --> 00:03:52.212
where you all are today,

00:03:52.236 --> 00:03:53.942
the Kakuma camp.

00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:57.646
Now, I want you all to be very quiet
just for a moment.

00:04:00.574 --> 00:04:02.153
Do you hear that?

00:04:04.022 --> 00:04:07.206
The sound of silence.

00:04:08.268 --> 00:04:09.642
No gunshots.

00:04:11.157 --> 00:04:13.500
Peace, at last.

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:17.734
That was my first memory of this camp.

00:04:19.154 --> 00:04:21.507
When you move from a war zone

00:04:21.531 --> 00:04:24.054
and come to a secure place like Kakuma,

00:04:24.078 --> 00:04:25.529
you've really gone far.

00:04:27.655 --> 00:04:30.556
I only stayed in the camp
for three years, though.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.644
My father, who had been absent
in most of my early childhood,

00:04:33.668 --> 00:04:35.055
came back into my life.

00:04:35.697 --> 00:04:39.086
And he organized for me
to move with my uncle

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.670
to our family in Nakuru.

00:04:41.328 --> 00:04:43.771
There, I found my father's first wife,

00:04:43.795 --> 00:04:47.376
my half sisters and my half brothers.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.479
I got enrolled in school.

00:04:49.503 --> 00:04:54.081
I remember my first day in school --
I could sing and laugh again --

00:04:54.105 --> 00:04:57.403
and my first set of school
uniforms, you bet.

00:04:58.317 --> 00:04:59.678
It was amazing.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.765
But then I came to realize

00:05:04.622 --> 00:05:08.884
that my uncle did not find it fit
for me to go to school,

00:05:10.194 --> 00:05:12.873
simply because I was a girl.

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:17.590
My half brothers were his first priority.

00:05:18.622 --> 00:05:22.383
He would say, "Educating a girl
is a waste of time."

00:05:22.773 --> 00:05:27.734
And for that reason, I missed
many days of school,

00:05:27.758 --> 00:05:29.735
because the fees were not paid.

00:05:31.364 --> 00:05:33.281
My father stepped in

00:05:33.305 --> 00:05:36.428
and organized for me
to go to boarding school.

00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:41.313
I remember the faith that he put in me
over the couple of years to come.

00:05:41.337 --> 00:05:47.000
He would say, "Education is an animal
that you have to overcome.

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:51.101
With an education, you can survive.

00:05:51.838 --> 00:05:55.924
Education shall be your first husband."

00:05:56.557 --> 00:06:01.633
And with these words came in
his first big investment.

00:06:01.657 --> 00:06:02.932
I felt lucky!

00:06:03.627 --> 00:06:06.806
But I was missing something:

00:06:08.462 --> 00:06:09.613
my mother.

00:06:11.064 --> 00:06:13.555
My mother had been left
behind in the camp,

00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:17.024
and I had not seen her since I left it.

00:06:18.197 --> 00:06:22.816
Six years without seeing her
was really long.

00:06:24.245 --> 00:06:25.488
I was alone,

00:06:26.178 --> 00:06:27.417
in school,

00:06:28.117 --> 00:06:29.735
when I heard of her death.

00:06:32.128 --> 00:06:34.704
I've seen many people back in South Sudan

00:06:36.316 --> 00:06:37.977
lose their lives.

00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:39.924
I've heard from neighbors

00:06:39.948 --> 00:06:42.425
lose their sons, their husbands,

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:44.435
their children.

00:06:45.104 --> 00:06:48.573
But I never thought that that
would ever come into my life.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.396
A month earlier, my stepmother,

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.439
who had been so good to me
back in Nakuru, died first.

00:06:59.764 --> 00:07:05.202
Then I came to realize that
after giving birth to four girls,

00:07:05.226 --> 00:07:08.541
my mother had finally
given birth to something

00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:12.276
that could have made her
be accepted into the community --

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.847
a baby boy,

00:07:13.871 --> 00:07:15.451
my baby brother.

00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:18.718
But he, too,

00:07:18.742 --> 00:07:21.354
joined the list of the dead.

00:07:23.982 --> 00:07:25.891
The most hurting part for me

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:31.349
was the fact that I wasn't able
to attend my mother's burial.

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:33.270
I wasn't allowed.

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:39.354
They said her family did not find it fit

00:07:39.378 --> 00:07:43.162
for her children, who are all girls,
to attend her burial,

00:07:44.016 --> 00:07:45.764
simply because we were girls.

00:07:46.806 --> 00:07:48.835
They would lament to me and say,

00:07:49.634 --> 00:07:51.630
"We are sorry, Mary, for your loss.

00:07:52.689 --> 00:07:57.848
We are sorry that your parents
never left behind any children."

00:07:59.415 --> 00:08:00.850
And I would wonder:

00:08:01.792 --> 00:08:02.976
What are we?

00:08:04.061 --> 00:08:05.385
Are we not children?

00:08:06.858 --> 00:08:09.760
In the mentality of my community,

00:08:09.784 --> 00:08:11.690
only the boy child counted.

00:08:13.419 --> 00:08:16.706
And for that reason,
I knew this was the end of me.

00:08:19.606 --> 00:08:21.242
But I was the eldest girl.

00:08:21.794 --> 00:08:23.730
I had to take care of my siblings.

00:08:23.754 --> 00:08:25.790
I had to ensure they went to school.

00:08:26.674 --> 00:08:29.178
I was 13 years old.

00:08:29.745 --> 00:08:32.017
How could I have made that happen?

00:08:33.208 --> 00:08:36.811
I came back to the camp
to take care of my siblings.

00:08:36.835 --> 00:08:38.390
I've never felt so stuck.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:44.177
But then, one of my aunts, Auntie Okoi,

00:08:44.201 --> 00:08:45.990
decided to take my sisters.

00:08:46.643 --> 00:08:49.992
My father sent me money from Juba
for me to go back to school.

00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:54.519
Boarding school was heaven,
but it was also so hard.

00:08:55.154 --> 00:08:58.727
I remember during the visiting days
when parents would come to school,

00:08:58.751 --> 00:09:00.155
and my father would miss.

00:09:00.179 --> 00:09:01.889
But when he did come,

00:09:01.913 --> 00:09:03.700
he repeated the same faith in me.

00:09:03.724 --> 00:09:05.030
This time he would say,

00:09:05.054 --> 00:09:07.763
"Mary, you cannot go astray,

00:09:07.787 --> 00:09:10.989
because you are the future
of your siblings."

00:09:12.142 --> 00:09:15.764
But then, in 2012,

00:09:15.788 --> 00:09:19.762
life took away the only thing
that I was clinging on.

00:09:20.395 --> 00:09:21.721
My father died.

00:09:23.783 --> 00:09:26.019
My grades in school started to collapse,

00:09:27.643 --> 00:09:33.624
and when I sat for my final
high school exams in 2015,

00:09:33.648 --> 00:09:37.240
I was devastated to receive a C grade.

00:09:37.264 --> 00:09:39.565
OK, I keep telling students in my class,

00:09:39.589 --> 00:09:42.958
"It's not about the A's;
it's about doing your best."

00:09:43.461 --> 00:09:44.640
That was not my best.

00:09:45.887 --> 00:09:47.152
I was determined.

00:09:47.176 --> 00:09:49.556
I wanted to go back and try again.

00:09:50.664 --> 00:09:52.295
But my parents were gone.

00:09:52.972 --> 00:09:54.527
I had no one to take care of me,

00:09:54.551 --> 00:09:56.445
and I had no one to pay that fee.

00:09:56.863 --> 00:09:58.382
I felt so hopeless.

00:10:00.412 --> 00:10:02.562
But then, one of my best friends,

00:10:02.586 --> 00:10:05.939
a beautiful Kenyan lady, Esther Kaecha,

00:10:05.963 --> 00:10:08.027
called me during this devastating moment,

00:10:08.051 --> 00:10:11.412
and she was like, "Mary,
you have a strong will.

00:10:11.436 --> 00:10:13.685
And I have a plan,
and it's going to work."

00:10:14.261 --> 00:10:18.258
OK, when you're in those devastating
moments, you accept anything, right?

00:10:18.282 --> 00:10:21.393
So the plan was, she organized
some travel money

00:10:21.417 --> 00:10:24.528
for us to travel to
Anester Victory Girls High School.

00:10:25.262 --> 00:10:26.693
I remember that day so well.

00:10:26.717 --> 00:10:30.174
It was raining when we entered
the principal's office.

00:10:30.198 --> 00:10:33.294
We were shaking like two chickens
that had been rained on,

00:10:33.318 --> 00:10:34.492
and we looked at him.

00:10:34.516 --> 00:10:36.413
He was asking, "What do you want?"

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.108
And we looked at him with the cat face.

00:10:39.132 --> 00:10:41.233
"We just want to go back to school."

00:10:41.257 --> 00:10:45.596
Well, believe it or not,
he not only paid our school fees

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.733
but also our uniform
and pocket money for food.

00:10:49.757 --> 00:10:50.980
Clap for him.

00:10:51.004 --> 00:10:52.827
(Applause)

00:10:53.766 --> 00:10:55.848
When I finished my high school career,

00:10:55.872 --> 00:10:57.405
I became the head girl.

00:10:57.984 --> 00:11:01.349
And when I sat for the KCSE
for a second time,

00:11:01.373 --> 00:11:04.023
I was able to receive a B minus. Clap.

00:11:04.047 --> 00:11:06.287
(Applause)

00:11:06.311 --> 00:11:07.466
Thank you.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.900
So I really want to say thank you
to Anester Victory, Mr. Gatimu

00:11:11.924 --> 00:11:15.607
and the whole Anester fraternity
for giving me that chance.

00:11:17.084 --> 00:11:18.743
From time to time,

00:11:18.767 --> 00:11:23.570
members of my family will insist
that my sister and I should get married

00:11:23.594 --> 00:11:25.692
so that somebody will take care of us.

00:11:26.722 --> 00:11:28.025
They will say,

00:11:28.049 --> 00:11:29.397
"We have a man for you."

00:11:30.153 --> 00:11:35.593
I really hate the fact that people
took us as property rather than children.

00:11:36.092 --> 00:11:38.087
Sometimes they will jokingly say,

00:11:38.111 --> 00:11:40.223
"You are going to lose your market value

00:11:40.247 --> 00:11:41.925
the more educated you become."

00:11:42.457 --> 00:11:44.439
But the truth is,

00:11:44.463 --> 00:11:47.892
an educated woman is feared
in my community.

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:49.915
But I told them, this is not what I want.

00:11:51.056 --> 00:11:54.049
I don't want to get kids at 16
like my mother did.

00:11:55.494 --> 00:11:57.091
This is not my life.

00:11:57.528 --> 00:11:59.604
Even though my sisters
and I are suffering,

00:11:59.628 --> 00:12:02.156
there's no way we are
heading in that direction.

00:12:02.528 --> 00:12:04.964
I refuse to repeat history.

00:12:06.094 --> 00:12:11.242
Educating a girl will create
equal and stable societies.

00:12:11.266 --> 00:12:15.569
And educated refugees will be the hope

00:12:15.593 --> 00:12:18.458
of rebuilding their countries someday.

00:12:18.956 --> 00:12:22.709
Girls and women have
a part to play in this

00:12:22.733 --> 00:12:24.554
just as much as men.

00:12:24.578 --> 00:12:28.259
Well, we have men in my family
that encourage me to move on:

00:12:28.283 --> 00:12:31.239
my half brothers and also my half sisters.

00:12:32.726 --> 00:12:34.644
When I finished my high school career,

00:12:35.285 --> 00:12:40.802
I moved my sisters to Nairobi,
where they live with my stepsister.

00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:43.504
They live 17 people in a house.

00:12:44.138 --> 00:12:45.333
But don't pity us.

00:12:45.935 --> 00:12:51.363
The most important thing
is that they all get a decent education.

00:12:53.534 --> 00:12:55.080
The winners of today

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.997
are the losers of yesterday,

00:12:58.557 --> 00:13:00.137
but who never gave up.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.709
And that is who we are,

00:13:02.733 --> 00:13:04.126
my sisters and I.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.151
And I'm so proud of that.

00:13:06.175 --> 00:13:07.956
My biggest investment in life --

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.020
(Applause)

00:13:09.044 --> 00:13:11.923
is the education of my sisters.

00:13:12.868 --> 00:13:17.536
Education creates an equal and fair chance
for everyone to make it.

00:13:18.128 --> 00:13:21.419
I personally believe education
is not all about the syllabus.

00:13:21.841 --> 00:13:23.188
It's about friendship.

00:13:23.746 --> 00:13:25.981
It's about discovering our talents.

00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:29.238
It's about discovering our destiny.

00:13:29.914 --> 00:13:32.468
I will, for example, not forget
the joy that I had

00:13:32.492 --> 00:13:34.730
when I first had singing
lessons in school,

00:13:34.754 --> 00:13:36.397
which is still a passion of mine.

00:13:36.421 --> 00:13:38.478
But I wouldn't have gotten that

00:13:38.502 --> 00:13:39.759
anywhere else.

00:13:41.061 --> 00:13:45.468
As a teacher, I see
my classroom as a laboratory

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:48.437
that not only generates
skills and knowledge

00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:51.315
but also understanding and hope.

00:13:51.881 --> 00:13:53.166
Let's take a tree.

00:13:53.894 --> 00:13:55.939
A tree may have its branches cut,

00:13:57.022 --> 00:14:01.451
but give it water, and it will
grow new branches.

00:14:01.475 --> 00:14:03.078
For the child of war,

00:14:03.102 --> 00:14:09.129
an education can turn their tears of loss
into a passion for peace.

00:14:09.153 --> 00:14:14.163
And for that reason, I refuse to give up
on a single student in my class.

00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:16.503
(Applause)

00:14:16.527 --> 00:14:17.969
Education heals.

00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:21.105
The school environment

00:14:21.129 --> 00:14:24.170
gives you a focus to focus ahead.

00:14:25.245 --> 00:14:26.568
Let's take it this way:

00:14:26.592 --> 00:14:29.055
when you're busy solving
mathematical equations,

00:14:29.079 --> 00:14:31.364
and you are memorizing poetry,

00:14:31.388 --> 00:14:35.459
you forget the violence
that you witnessed back home.

00:14:35.931 --> 00:14:39.416
And that is the power of education.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.290
It creates this place for peace.

00:14:42.856 --> 00:14:44.825
Kakuma is teeming with learners.

00:14:44.849 --> 00:14:50.026
Over 85,000 students
are enrolled in schools here,

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:53.597
which makes up 40 percent
of the refugee population.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:15:00.945
It includes children who lost years
of education because of the war back home.

00:15:01.584 --> 00:15:03.479
And I want to ask you a question:

00:15:04.568 --> 00:15:08.922
If education is about
building a generation of hope,

00:15:09.754 --> 00:15:14.398
why are there 120 students
packed in my classroom?

00:15:16.288 --> 00:15:20.307
Why is it that only six percent
of the primary school students

00:15:20.331 --> 00:15:22.067
are making it to high school,

00:15:22.091 --> 00:15:25.754
simply because we do not have
enough places for them?

00:15:26.376 --> 00:15:31.435
And why is it that only one percent
of the secondary school graduates

00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:33.120
are making it to university?

00:15:34.458 --> 00:15:36.833
I began by saying that I am a teacher.

00:15:37.692 --> 00:15:41.010
But once again, I have become a student.

00:15:42.247 --> 00:15:44.313
In March, I moved to Rwanda

00:15:45.192 --> 00:15:48.775
on a scholarship program
called "Bridge2Rwanda."

00:15:49.503 --> 00:15:52.491
It prepares scholars for universities.

00:15:53.173 --> 00:15:57.523
They are able to get a chance to compete
for universities abroad.

00:15:57.961 --> 00:16:00.772
I am now having teachers
telling me what to do,

00:16:00.796 --> 00:16:02.845
instead of the other way round.

00:16:02.869 --> 00:16:06.507
People are once again investing in me.

00:16:07.587 --> 00:16:12.128
So I want to ask you all
to invest in young refugees.

00:16:12.818 --> 00:16:15.094
Think of the tree
that we mentioned earlier.

00:16:15.995 --> 00:16:18.659
We are the generation to plant it,

00:16:19.422 --> 00:16:22.910
so that the next generation can water it,

00:16:23.498 --> 00:16:27.594
and the one that follows
will enjoy the shade.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.242
They will reap the benefits.

00:16:31.016 --> 00:16:33.457
And the greatest benefit of them all

00:16:34.263 --> 00:16:37.482
is an education that will last.

00:16:38.084 --> 00:16:39.314
Thank you.

00:16:39.648 --> 00:16:45.751
(Applause)
