00:00:07.646 --> 00:00:09.840
Oh, excuse me!

00:00:10.642 --> 00:00:13.394
Have you ever yawned
because somebody else yawned?

00:00:13.418 --> 00:00:15.144
You aren't especially tired,

00:00:15.168 --> 00:00:18.185
yet suddenly your mouth opens wide

00:00:18.209 --> 00:00:21.211
and a big yawn

00:00:22.475 --> 00:00:23.479
comes out.

00:00:24.305 --> 00:00:27.213
This phenomenon is known
as contagious yawning.

00:00:27.237 --> 00:00:29.571
And while scientists still
don't fully understand

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:30.615
why it happens,

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:33.123
there are many hypotheses
currently being researched.

00:00:33.782 --> 00:00:36.557
Let's take a look at a few
of the most prevalent ones,

00:00:36.581 --> 00:00:38.975
beginning with two
physiological hypotheses

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:41.189
before moving to a psychological one.

00:00:42.436 --> 00:00:44.730
Our first physiological hypothesis

00:00:44.754 --> 00:00:48.501
states that contagious yawning
is triggered by a specific stimulus,

00:00:48.525 --> 00:00:49.988
an initial yawn.

00:00:50.012 --> 00:00:52.617
This is called fixed action pattern.

00:00:53.228 --> 00:00:55.919
Think of fixed action pattern
like a reflex.

00:00:55.943 --> 00:00:58.668
Your yawn makes me yawn.

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:02.091
Similar to a domino effect,
one person's yawn triggers a yawn

00:01:02.115 --> 00:01:04.974
in a person nearby
that has observed the act.

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:08.506
Once this reflex is triggered,
it must run its course.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.519
Have you ever tried to stop
a yawn once it has begun?

00:01:11.543 --> 00:01:14.531
Basically impossible!

00:01:15.268 --> 00:01:17.154
Another physiological hypothesis

00:01:17.178 --> 00:01:20.276
is known as non-conscious mimicry,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.988
or the chameleon effect.

00:01:22.012 --> 00:01:24.560
This occurs when you
imitate someone's behavior

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:25.919
without knowing it,

00:01:25.943 --> 00:01:28.289
a subtle and unintentional
copycat maneuver.

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:31.139
People tend to mimic
each other's postures.

00:01:31.163 --> 00:01:34.695
If you are seated across from someone
that has their legs crossed,

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.584
you might cross your own legs.

00:01:37.458 --> 00:01:38.891
This hypothesis suggests

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:41.372
that we yawn when we see someone else yawn

00:01:41.396 --> 00:01:44.248
because we are unconsciously copying
his or her behavior.

00:01:45.148 --> 00:01:48.306
Scientists believe that this chameleon
effect is possible

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.215
because of a special set of neurons
known as mirror neurons.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.562
Mirror neurons are a type of brain cell

00:01:55.586 --> 00:01:58.123
that responds equally
when we perform an action

00:01:58.147 --> 00:02:01.213
as when we see someone else
perform the same action.

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:04.747
These neurons are important
for learning and self-awareness.

00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:07.898
For example, watching someone
do something physical,

00:02:07.922 --> 00:02:10.627
like knitting or putting on lipstick,

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:14.566
can help you do those same
actions more accurately.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.677
Neuroimaging studies using fMRI,
functional magnetic resonance imaging,

00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:23.897
show us that when we seem someone yawn
or even hear their yawn,

00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:27.368
a specific area of the brain
housing these mirror neurons

00:02:27.392 --> 00:02:28.563
tends to light up,

00:02:28.587 --> 00:02:32.555
which, in turn, causes us to respond
with the same action:

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:33.601
a yawn!

00:02:34.227 --> 00:02:38.942
Our psychological hypothesis also involves
the work of these mirror neurons.

00:02:38.966 --> 00:02:41.434
We will call it the empathy yawn.

00:02:42.227 --> 00:02:45.346
Empathy is the ability to understand
what someone else is feeling

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.818
and partake in their emotion,

00:02:46.842 --> 00:02:49.035
a crucial ability
for social animals like us.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.067
Recently, neuroscientists have found
that a subset of mirror neurons

00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:56.385
allows us to empathize
with others' feelings

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:57.573
at a deeper level.

00:02:57.597 --> 00:02:58.598
(Yawn)

00:02:58.622 --> 00:03:01.338
Scientists discovered
this empathetic response to yawning

00:03:01.362 --> 00:03:03.616
while testing the first
hypothesis we mentioned,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.125
fixed action pattern.

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:08.942
This study was set up to show
that dogs would enact a yawn reflex

00:03:08.966 --> 00:03:11.597
at the mere sound of a human yawn.

00:03:12.127 --> 00:03:15.971
While their study showed this to be true,
they found something else interesting.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.773
Dogs yawned more frequently
at familiar yawns,

00:03:19.797 --> 00:03:21.273
such as from their owners,

00:03:21.297 --> 00:03:23.698
than at unfamiliar yawns from strangers.

00:03:24.397 --> 00:03:27.318
Following this research,
other studies on humans and primates

00:03:27.342 --> 00:03:29.224
have also shown that contagious yawning

00:03:29.248 --> 00:03:32.218
occurs more frequently
among friends than strangers.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.684
In fact, contagious
yawning starts occurring

00:03:35.708 --> 00:03:38.315
when we are about four or five years old,

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:39.711
at the point when children

00:03:39.735 --> 00:03:42.574
develop the ability to identify
others' emotions properly.

00:03:43.513 --> 00:03:47.409
Still, while newer scientific studies aim
to prove that contagious yawning

00:03:47.433 --> 00:03:49.389
is based on this capacity for empathy,

00:03:49.413 --> 00:03:52.861
more research is needed to shed light
on what exactly is going on.

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:56.888
It's possible that the answer lies
in another hypothesis altogether.

00:03:57.498 --> 00:03:59.440
The next time you get caught in a yawn,

00:03:59.464 --> 00:04:01.787
take a second to think
about what just happened.

00:04:02.653 --> 00:04:04.229
Were you thinking about a yawn?

00:04:05.026 --> 00:04:06.554
Did someone near you yawn?

00:04:07.015 --> 00:04:09.995
Was that person a stranger
or someone close?

00:04:11.182 --> 00:04:14.145
And are you yawning right now?

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:18.983
(Yawn)

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:20.889
(Lip smacking)
