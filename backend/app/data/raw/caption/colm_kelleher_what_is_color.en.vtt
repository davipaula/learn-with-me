00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:18.115
One of the most striking properties
about life is that it has color.

00:00:18.115 --> 00:00:22.440
To understand the phenomenon of color,
it helps to think about light as a wave.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.545
But, before we get to that,

00:00:24.545 --> 00:00:27.546
let's talk a little bit
about waves in general.

00:00:27.546 --> 00:00:33.085
Imagine you're sitting on a boat on the ocean
watching a cork bob up and down in the water.

00:00:33.085 --> 00:00:36.279
The first thing you notice about
the motion is that it repeats itself.

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:41.930
The cork traces the same path over and
over again... up and down, up and down.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.000
This repetitive or periodic motion
is characteristic of waves.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.430
Then you notice something else...

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.917
using a stopwatch, you measure
the time it takes for the piece of cork

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:56.381
to go over its highest position down
to its lowest and then back up again.

00:00:56.381 --> 00:00:58.234
Suppose this takes two seconds.

00:00:58.234 --> 00:01:02.746
To use the physics jargon, you've measured
the period of the waves that cork is bobbing on.

00:01:02.746 --> 00:01:06.613
That is, how long it takes a wave to go
through its full range of motion once.

00:01:06.613 --> 00:01:12.530
The same information can be expressed
in a different way by calculating the wave's frequency.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.683
Frequency, as the name suggest, tells you
how frequent the waves are.

00:01:16.683 --> 00:01:19.746
That is, how many of them
go by in one second.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:22.631
If you know how many seconds
one full wave takes,

00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:26.188
then it's easy to work out
how many waves go by in one second.

00:01:26.188 --> 00:01:32.653
In this case, since each wave takes 2 seconds,
the frequency is 0.5 waves per second.

00:01:32.653 --> 00:01:36.515
So enough about bobbing corks...
What about light and color?

00:01:36.515 --> 00:01:39.229
If light is a wave, then it must
have a frequency. Right?

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.942
Well... yes, it does.

00:01:40.942 --> 00:01:45.288
And it turns out that we already have a name for the frequency of the light that our eyes detect.

00:01:45.288 --> 00:01:46.982
It's called color.

00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:51.396
That's right. Color is nothing more than a measure
of how quickly the light waves are waving.

00:01:51.396 --> 00:01:55.731
If our eyes were quick enough, we might be able to observe this periodic motion directly,

00:01:55.731 --> 00:01:57.897
like we can with the cork and the ocean.

00:01:57.897 --> 00:02:00.161
But the frequency of the light
we see is so high,

00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:04.386
it waves up and down about
400 million million times a second,

00:02:04.387 --> 00:02:10.814
that we can't possibly see it as a wave. But we can tell, by looking at its color, what its frequency is.

00:02:10.814 --> 00:02:14.975
The lowest frequency light that we can see
is red and the highest frequency is purple.

00:02:14.975 --> 00:02:20.914
In between all the other frequencies form a continuous band of color, called the visible spectrum.

00:02:20.914 --> 00:02:24.139
So, what if you had a yellow pencil
sitting on your desk?

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:29.151
Well, the sun emits all colors of light,
so light of all colors is hitting your pencil.

00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:34.079
The pencil looks yellow because it reflects yellow light more than it reflects the other colors.

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.665
What happens to the blue,
purple and red light?

00:02:36.665 --> 00:02:40.766
They get absorbed and the energy
they are carrying is turned into heat.

00:02:40.766 --> 00:02:42.847
It is similar with objects
of other colors.

00:02:42.847 --> 00:02:46.606
Blue things reflect blue light,
red things reflect red light and so on.

00:02:46.606 --> 00:02:48.867
White objects reflect all colors of light,

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:52.945
while black things do exactly the opposite
and absorb at all frequencies.

00:02:52.945 --> 00:02:58.871
This - by the way - is why it's uncomfortable
to wear your favorite Metallica t-shirt on a sunny day.
