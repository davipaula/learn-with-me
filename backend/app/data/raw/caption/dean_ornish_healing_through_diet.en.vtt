00:00:12.548 --> 00:00:14.231
This session is on natural wonders,

00:00:14.255 --> 00:00:17.041
and the bigger conference
is on the pursuit of happiness.

00:00:17.065 --> 00:00:18.688
I want to try to combine them all,

00:00:18.712 --> 00:00:21.960
because to me, healing is really
the ultimate natural wonder.

00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:25.874
Your body has a remarkable
capacity to begin healing itself,

00:00:25.898 --> 00:00:28.553
and much more quickly
than people had once realized,

00:00:28.577 --> 00:00:31.470
if you simply stop doing
what's causing the problem.

00:00:31.494 --> 00:00:35.521
And so, really, so much of what we do
in medicine and life in general

00:00:35.545 --> 00:00:39.618
is focused on mopping up the floor
without also turning off the faucet.

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:41.366
I love doing this work,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.232
because it really gives many people
new hope and new choices

00:00:44.256 --> 00:00:45.853
that they didn't have before,

00:00:45.877 --> 00:00:50.533
and it allows us to talk
about things that -- not just diet,

00:00:50.557 --> 00:00:52.786
but that happiness is not --

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.918
we're talking about
the pursuit of happiness,

00:00:54.942 --> 00:00:57.624
but when you really look
at all the spiritual traditions,

00:00:57.648 --> 00:00:59.945
what Aldous Huxley called
the "perennial wisdom,"

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.227
when you get past the names and forms
and rituals that divide people,

00:01:03.251 --> 00:01:05.710
it's really about --
our nature is to be happy;

00:01:05.734 --> 00:01:08.496
our nature is to be peaceful,
our nature is to be healthy.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.344
And so happiness is not something you get,

00:01:11.368 --> 00:01:13.731
health is generally not
something that you get,

00:01:13.755 --> 00:01:16.334
but rather, all of these
different practices --

00:01:16.358 --> 00:01:19.842
you know, the ancient swamis and rabbis
and priests and monks and nuns

00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.454
didn't develop these techniques
to just manage stress

00:01:22.478 --> 00:01:24.969
or lower your blood pressure
or unclog your arteries,

00:01:24.993 --> 00:01:26.878
even though it can do all those things.

00:01:26.902 --> 00:01:28.935
They're powerful tools for transformation,

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:31.258
for quieting down our mind and bodies

00:01:31.282 --> 00:01:34.371
to allow us to experience
what it feels like to be happy,

00:01:34.395 --> 00:01:36.351
to be peaceful, to be joyful

00:01:36.375 --> 00:01:39.541
and to realize that it's not
something that you pursue and get,

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:43.195
but rather, it's something that you
have already, until you disturb it.

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.158
I studied yoga for many years
with a teacher named Swami Satchidananda.

00:01:47.182 --> 00:01:49.191
People would say, "What are you, a Hindu?"

00:01:49.215 --> 00:01:50.566
He'd say, "No, I'm an undo."

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.591
(Laughter)

00:01:51.615 --> 00:01:52.784
It's about identifying

00:01:52.808 --> 00:01:55.797
what's causing us to disturb
our innate health and happiness

00:01:55.821 --> 00:01:58.639
and then to allow
that natural healing to occur.

00:01:58.663 --> 00:02:00.854
To me, that's the real natural wonder.

00:02:00.878 --> 00:02:03.561
So, within that larger context,

00:02:03.585 --> 00:02:06.136
we can talk about diet,
stress management --

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.274
which are really
these spiritual practices --

00:02:08.298 --> 00:02:10.926
moderate exercise, smoking cessation,

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.645
support groups and community,
which I'll talk more about,

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:15.371
and some vitamins and supplements.

00:02:15.395 --> 00:02:16.547
And it's not a diet.

00:02:16.571 --> 00:02:18.700
When people think
about the diet I recommend,

00:02:18.724 --> 00:02:20.157
they think it's really strict.

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:22.249
For reversing disease,
that's what it takes.

00:02:22.273 --> 00:02:25.674
But if you're just trying to be healthy,
you have a spectrum of choices.

00:02:25.698 --> 00:02:28.301
To the degree that you can move
in a healthy direction,

00:02:28.325 --> 00:02:31.397
you're going to live longer,
feel better, lose weight, and so on.

00:02:31.421 --> 00:02:33.593
And in our studies,
what we've been able to do

00:02:33.617 --> 00:02:36.807
is to use very expensive, high-tech,
state-of-the-art measures

00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:40.566
to prove how powerful these very simple
and low-tech and low-cost --

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.576
and in many ways, ancient --
interventions can be.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.615
We first began by looking
at heart disease.

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.781
When I began doing this work
26 or 27 years ago,

00:02:48.805 --> 00:02:52.175
it was thought that once you have
heart disease, it can only get worse.

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:54.729
What we found was,
instead of getting worse and worse,

00:02:54.753 --> 00:02:56.907
in many cases,
it could get better and better,

00:02:56.931 --> 00:02:59.370
and much more quickly
than people had once realized.

00:02:59.394 --> 00:03:02.752
This is a representative patient
who, at the time, was 73,

00:03:02.776 --> 00:03:05.956
told he needed to have a bypass,
decided to do this instead.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.697
We used quantitative arteriography,
showing the narrowing.

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:11.274
This is one of the main arteries
that feeds the heart,

00:03:11.298 --> 00:03:12.978
and you can see the narrowing here.

00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:16.452
A year later, it's not as clogged;
normally, it goes the other direction.

00:03:16.476 --> 00:03:18.136
These minor changes in blockages

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.717
caused a 300 percent
improvement in blood flow,

00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:24.292
and using cardiac positron-emission
tomography, or PET, scans --

00:03:24.316 --> 00:03:26.097
blue and black is no blood flow,

00:03:26.121 --> 00:03:27.716
orange and white is maximal --

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.225
huge differences can occur
without drugs, without surgery.

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:33.394
Clinically, he couldn't walk
across the street

00:03:33.418 --> 00:03:35.041
without getting severe chest pain.

00:03:35.065 --> 00:03:37.506
Within a month, like most people,
he was pain-free,

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.921
and within a year, climbing more
than 100 floors a day on a StairMaster.

00:03:40.945 --> 00:03:42.098
This is not unusual,

00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:45.521
and it's part of what enables people
to maintain these kinds of changes,

00:03:45.545 --> 00:03:48.315
because it makes a big difference
in their quality of life.

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:50.876
If you looked at all the arteries
in all the patients,

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.549
they got worse and worse from one year
to five years in the comparison group.

00:03:54.573 --> 00:03:56.674
This is the natural history
of heart disease.

00:03:56.698 --> 00:03:59.966
But it's really not natural; we found
it could get better and better,

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.038
and much more quickly than people thought.

00:04:02.062 --> 00:04:04.836
We also found the more people changed,
the better they got.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.281
It wasn't a function
of how old or sick they were,

00:04:07.305 --> 00:04:09.023
but of how much they changed.

00:04:09.047 --> 00:04:11.639
The oldest patients improved
as much as the young ones.

00:04:11.663 --> 00:04:15.595
I got this Christmas card a few years ago
from patients in one of our programs.

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:18.461
The younger brother is 86;
the older one is 95.

00:04:18.485 --> 00:04:21.131
They wanted to show me
how much more flexible they were.

00:04:21.155 --> 00:04:24.017
The following year they sent this,
which I thought was funny.

00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:25.042
(Laughter)

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:26.236
You just never know.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.750
And what we found
was that 99 percent of the patients

00:04:28.774 --> 00:04:31.631
stopped or reversed the progression
of their heart disease.

00:04:31.655 --> 00:04:33.663
Now, I thought if we just
did good science,

00:04:33.687 --> 00:04:35.362
that would change medical practice.

00:04:35.386 --> 00:04:36.537
But that was naive.

00:04:36.561 --> 00:04:38.103
It's important, but not enough,

00:04:38.127 --> 00:04:40.184
because we doctors do
what we get paid to do

00:04:40.208 --> 00:04:42.166
and trained to do what we get paid to do,

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.008
so if we change insurance, then we change
medical practice and medical education.

00:04:46.032 --> 00:04:48.327
Insurance will cover the bypass
and angioplasty

00:04:48.351 --> 00:04:50.797
but won't, until recently,
cover diet and lifestyle.

00:04:50.821 --> 00:04:53.851
So we began, through our nonprofit
institute, training hospitals

00:04:53.875 --> 00:04:55.027
around the country,

00:04:55.051 --> 00:04:57.401
and we found that most people
could avoid surgery.

00:04:57.425 --> 00:05:00.648
And not only was it medically
effective, it was also cost-effective.

00:05:00.672 --> 00:05:03.160
The insurance companies found
that they began to save

00:05:03.184 --> 00:05:04.725
almost 30,000 dollars a patient,

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:07.950
and Medicare is now in the middle
of doing a demonstration project,

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:10.384
paying for 1,800 people
to go through the program

00:05:10.408 --> 00:05:11.563
in the sites we train.

00:05:11.587 --> 00:05:14.026
The fortuneteller says,
"I give smokers a discount,

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.839
because there's not as much to tell."

00:05:15.863 --> 00:05:17.017
(Laughter)

00:05:17.041 --> 00:05:18.192
I like this slide,

00:05:18.216 --> 00:05:21.802
because it's a chance to talk about
what really motivates people to change

00:05:21.826 --> 00:05:22.977
and what doesn't.

00:05:23.001 --> 00:05:26.199
What doesn't work is fear of dying,
and that's what's normally used.

00:05:26.223 --> 00:05:28.525
Everybody who smokes
knows it's not good for you.

00:05:28.549 --> 00:05:32.145
Still, 30 percent of Americans smoke,
80 percent in some parts of the world.

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.743
Why do people do it?

00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:36.016
Well, because it helps them
get through the day.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.284
I'll talk more about this,

00:05:37.308 --> 00:05:40.559
but the real epidemic isn't just
heart disease or obesity or smoking,

00:05:40.583 --> 00:05:42.078
it's loneliness and depression.

00:05:42.102 --> 00:05:45.110
One woman said, "I've got 20 friends
in this pack of cigarettes.

00:05:45.134 --> 00:05:47.378
They're always there for me,
and nobody else is.

00:05:47.402 --> 00:05:50.799
You're going to take away my 20 friends?
What are you going to give me?"

00:05:50.823 --> 00:05:54.014
Or they eat when they get depressed
or use alcohol to numb the pain

00:05:54.038 --> 00:05:55.859
or work too hard or watch too much TV.

00:05:55.883 --> 00:05:59.386
There are lots of ways we have of avoiding
and numbing and bypassing pain,

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.713
but the point of all of this
is to deal with the cause of the problem.

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:04.894
The pain is not the problem,
it's the symptom.

00:06:04.918 --> 00:06:08.122
And telling people they're going to die
is too scary to think about,

00:06:08.146 --> 00:06:11.011
or that they'll get emphysema
or a heart attack is too scary,

00:06:11.035 --> 00:06:13.514
and they don't want to think
about it, so they don't.

00:06:13.538 --> 00:06:16.352
The most effective
anti-smoking ad was this one.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.108
You'll notice the limp cigarette
hanging out of his mouth.

00:06:19.132 --> 00:06:21.734
And the headline is "Impotent,"
it's not "Emphysema."

00:06:21.758 --> 00:06:23.968
What was the biggest-selling
drug of all time,

00:06:23.992 --> 00:06:25.882
when it was introduced a few years ago?

00:06:25.906 --> 00:06:28.257
Viagra, right? Why?
Because a lot of guys need it.

00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:31.932
It's not like you say, "Joe, I'm having
erectile dysfunction. How about you?"

00:06:31.956 --> 00:06:35.041
And yet, look at the number
of prescriptions that are being sold.

00:06:35.065 --> 00:06:37.210
It's not so much
psychological, it's vascular,

00:06:37.234 --> 00:06:39.246
and nicotine makes
your arteries constrict.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.153
So does cocaine, so does a high-fat diet,
so does emotional stress.

00:06:43.177 --> 00:06:46.816
So the very behaviors that we think of
as being so sexy in our culture

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.569
are the very ones that leave
so many people feeling tired,

00:06:49.593 --> 00:06:51.279
lethargic, depressed and impotent.

00:06:51.303 --> 00:06:52.454
And that's not much fun.

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:55.489
But when you change those behaviors,
your brain gets more blood,

00:06:55.513 --> 00:06:57.495
you think more clearly, have more energy,

00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:59.670
your heart gets more blood,
as I've shown you.

00:06:59.694 --> 00:07:01.132
Your sexual function improves.

00:07:01.156 --> 00:07:02.687
These things occur within hours.

00:07:02.711 --> 00:07:04.284
This is a study: a high-fat meal,

00:07:04.308 --> 00:07:06.892
within one or two hours,
blood flow is measurably less.

00:07:06.916 --> 00:07:09.158
And you've all experienced
this at Thanksgiving.

00:07:09.182 --> 00:07:11.376
When you eat a big fatty meal,
how do you feel?

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.078
You feel kind of sleepy afterwards.

00:07:13.102 --> 00:07:16.351
On a low-fat meal, the blood flow
doesn't go down -- it even goes up.

00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:19.856
Many of you have kids, and you know
that's a big change in your lifestyle.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.411
People are not afraid
to make big changes in lifestyle

00:07:22.435 --> 00:07:23.608
if they're worth it.

00:07:23.632 --> 00:07:27.062
And the paradox is that when you make
big changes, you get big benefits,

00:07:27.086 --> 00:07:29.213
and you feel so much better so quickly.

00:07:29.237 --> 00:07:31.598
For many people,
those are choices worth making --

00:07:31.622 --> 00:07:33.770
not to live longer, but to live better.

00:07:33.794 --> 00:07:36.385
I want to talk a little bit
about the obesity epidemic,

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:38.237
because it really is a problem.

00:07:38.261 --> 00:07:40.931
Two-thirds of adults
are overweight or obese,

00:07:40.955 --> 00:07:43.617
and diabetes in kids and 30-year-olds

00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:45.811
has increased 70 percent
in the last 10 years.

00:07:45.835 --> 00:07:47.358
It's no joke, it's real.

00:07:47.382 --> 00:07:49.960
And just to show you this,
this is from the CDC.

00:07:49.984 --> 00:07:51.464
These are not election returns;

00:07:51.488 --> 00:07:54.014
these are the percentage of people
who are overweight.

00:07:54.038 --> 00:08:00.572
And if you see from '85 to '86
to '87, '88, '89, '90, '91 --

00:08:00.596 --> 00:08:02.957
you get a new category, 15 to 20 percent;

00:08:02.981 --> 00:08:09.102
'92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97 --
you get a new category;

00:08:09.126 --> 00:08:12.593
'98, '99, 2000 and 2001.

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:15.961
Mississippi, more than 25 percent
of people are overweight.

00:08:15.985 --> 00:08:19.417
Why is this? Well, this is one way
to lose weight that works very well --

00:08:19.441 --> 00:08:20.446
(Laughter)

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.471
but it doesn't last, which is the problem.

00:08:22.495 --> 00:08:23.497
(Laughter)

00:08:23.521 --> 00:08:25.713
Now, there's no mystery
in how you lose weight;

00:08:25.737 --> 00:08:27.759
you either burn more calories by exercise

00:08:27.783 --> 00:08:29.079
or you eat fewer calories.

00:08:29.103 --> 00:08:32.080
Now, one way to eat fewer calories
is to eat less food,

00:08:32.104 --> 00:08:35.201
which is why you can lose weight
on any diet if you eat less food,

00:08:35.225 --> 00:08:37.388
or if you restrict
entire categories of foods.

00:08:37.412 --> 00:08:40.425
But the problem is, you get hungry,
so it's hard to keep it off.

00:08:40.449 --> 00:08:42.506
The other way is to change
the type of food.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.220
And fat has nine calories per gram,

00:08:44.244 --> 00:08:46.221
whereas protein and carbs only have four.

00:08:46.245 --> 00:08:50.222
So when you eat less fat, you eat fewer
calories without having to eat less food.

00:08:50.246 --> 00:08:52.110
So you can eat the same amount of food,

00:08:52.134 --> 00:08:53.720
but you're getting fewer calories

00:08:53.744 --> 00:08:55.757
because the food
is less dense in calories.

00:08:55.781 --> 00:08:59.128
And it's the volume of food that affects
satiety, rather than the type.

00:08:59.152 --> 00:09:02.406
I don't like talking about the Atkins
diet, but I get asked about it,

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.396
so thought I'd spend a few minutes on it.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.629
The myth that you hear is,
Americans have been told to eat less fat,

00:09:07.653 --> 00:09:09.631
the percent of calories from fat is down,

00:09:09.655 --> 00:09:12.804
Americans are fatter than ever,
therefore fat doesn't make you fat.

00:09:12.828 --> 00:09:13.980
It's a half-truth.

00:09:14.004 --> 00:09:17.360
Actually, Americans are eating
more fat than ever, and even more carbs.

00:09:17.384 --> 00:09:20.209
So the percentage is lower,
but the actual amount is higher,

00:09:20.233 --> 00:09:21.710
so the goal is to reduce both.

00:09:21.734 --> 00:09:24.737
Dr. Atkins and I debated each other
many times before he died,

00:09:24.761 --> 00:09:28.416
and we agreed that Americans eat
too many simple carbs, the "bad carbs."

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.794
And these are things like --

00:09:29.818 --> 00:09:30.824
(Laughter)

00:09:30.848 --> 00:09:33.122
sugar, white flour, white rice, alcohol.

00:09:33.146 --> 00:09:34.481
And you get a double whammy:

00:09:34.505 --> 00:09:36.804
you get all these calories
that don't fill you up

00:09:36.828 --> 00:09:38.407
because you've removed the fiber,

00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:41.227
and they get absorbed quickly
so your blood sugar zooms up.

00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:44.308
Your pancreas makes insulin
to bring it back down, which is good,

00:09:44.332 --> 00:09:47.146
but insulin accelerates
the conversion of calories into fat.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.060
So the goal is not to go to pork rinds,
bacon and sausages --

00:09:50.084 --> 00:09:51.492
these are not health foods --

00:09:51.516 --> 00:09:53.536
but to go from "bad carbs"
to "good carbs."

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.054
These are things like whole foods
or unrefined carbs.

00:09:56.078 --> 00:09:58.466
Fruits, vegetables,
whole wheat flour, brown rice,

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.801
in their natural forms, are rich in fiber.

00:10:00.825 --> 00:10:03.574
The fiber fills you up
before you get too many calories

00:10:03.598 --> 00:10:04.975
and it slows the absorption,

00:10:04.999 --> 00:10:07.319
so you don't get
that rapid rise in blood sugar.

00:10:07.343 --> 00:10:09.704
And you get all
the disease-protective substances.

00:10:09.728 --> 00:10:11.872
It's not just what you exclude
from your diet,

00:10:11.896 --> 00:10:13.970
but also what you include
that's protective.

00:10:13.994 --> 00:10:17.807
Just as all carbs are not bad for you,
all fats are not bad; there are good fats.

00:10:17.831 --> 00:10:20.650
These are predominantly
what are called omega-3 fatty acids.

00:10:20.674 --> 00:10:22.580
You find them, for example, in fish oil.

00:10:22.604 --> 00:10:25.432
Bad fats are things like
trans-fatty acids in processed food

00:10:25.456 --> 00:10:27.461
and saturated fats, which we find in meat.

00:10:27.485 --> 00:10:29.542
If you remember nothing else
from this talk:

00:10:29.566 --> 00:10:33.475
three grams a day of fish oil can reduce
the risk of heart attack and sudden death

00:10:33.499 --> 00:10:34.651
by 50 to 80 percent.

00:10:34.675 --> 00:10:35.827
Three grams a day.

00:10:35.851 --> 00:10:37.330
They come in one-gram capsules;

00:10:37.354 --> 00:10:39.934
more than that just gives you
extra fat you don't need.

00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:42.628
It also helps reduce the risk
of the most common cancers,

00:10:42.652 --> 00:10:44.208
like breast, prostate and colon.

00:10:44.232 --> 00:10:45.962
The problem with the Atkins diet is,

00:10:45.986 --> 00:10:48.203
everyone knows people
who've lost weight on it,

00:10:48.227 --> 00:10:50.717
but you can lose weight
on amphetamines and fen-phen;

00:10:50.741 --> 00:10:53.805
there are lots of ways of losing weight
that aren't good for you.

00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:56.314
You want to do it
in a way that enhances your health,

00:10:56.338 --> 00:10:57.496
not one that harms it.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.678
The problem is,
it's based on this half-truth:

00:10:59.702 --> 00:11:01.431
Americans eat too many simple carbs,

00:11:01.455 --> 00:11:03.396
so if you eat fewer, you'll lose weight,

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.104
and even more weight
if you eat whole foods and less fat,

00:11:06.128 --> 00:11:08.657
and you'll enhance your health
rather than harming it.

00:11:08.681 --> 00:11:10.068
He says, "I've got good news.

00:11:10.092 --> 00:11:12.476
While your cholesterol level
has remained the same,

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.237
the research findings have changed."

00:11:14.261 --> 00:11:15.264
(Laughter)

00:11:15.288 --> 00:11:18.304
Now what happens to your heart
when you go on an Atkins diet?

00:11:18.328 --> 00:11:20.785
The red is good; at the beginning
and a year later.

00:11:20.809 --> 00:11:24.028
This is from a study in a peer-reviewed
journal called "Angiology."

00:11:24.052 --> 00:11:27.163
There's more red after a year
on a diet like I would recommend,

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:30.610
there's less red, less blood flow
after a year on an Atkins-type diet.

00:11:30.634 --> 00:11:34.403
So, yes, you can lose weight,
but your heart isn't happy.

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:36.815
Now one of the studies
funded by the Atkins Center

00:11:36.839 --> 00:11:39.329
found that 70 percent
of the people were constipated,

00:11:39.353 --> 00:11:40.616
65 percent had bad breath,

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.037
54 percent had headaches --

00:11:42.061 --> 00:11:43.863
this is not a healthy way to eat.

00:11:43.887 --> 00:11:47.368
So you might start to lose weight
and start to attract people towards you,

00:11:47.392 --> 00:11:50.014
but when they get too close,
it's going to be a problem.

00:11:50.038 --> 00:11:51.043
(Laughter)

00:11:51.067 --> 00:11:54.241
And more seriously, there are case
reports now of 16-year-old girls

00:11:54.265 --> 00:11:56.416
who died after a few weeks
on the Atkins diet,

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.451
of bone disease,
kidney disease, and so on.

00:11:58.475 --> 00:12:00.482
And that's how your body excretes waste --

00:12:00.506 --> 00:12:02.624
through your breath,
bowels and perspiration.

00:12:02.648 --> 00:12:05.603
So when you go on these kinds
of diet, they begin to smell bad.

00:12:05.627 --> 00:12:08.533
An optimal diet is low in fat,
low in the bad carbs,

00:12:08.557 --> 00:12:11.441
high in the good carbs
and enough of the good fats.

00:12:11.465 --> 00:12:13.136
And then, again, it's a spectrum:

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:16.044
when you move in this direction,
you're going to lose weight,

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:18.078
you'll feel better,
and you'll gain health.

00:12:18.102 --> 00:12:21.370
There are ecological reasons
for eating lower on the food chain too,

00:12:21.394 --> 00:12:23.466
whether it's the deforestation
in the Amazon

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.016
or making more protein available

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.678
to the four billion people
who live on a dollar a day,

00:12:27.702 --> 00:12:30.627
not to mention whatever
ethical concerns people have.

00:12:30.651 --> 00:12:32.916
So there are lots of reasons
for eating this way

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.484
that go beyond just your health.

00:12:34.508 --> 00:12:36.514
Now, we're about to publish
the first study

00:12:36.538 --> 00:12:39.825
looking at the effects of this program
on prostate cancer,

00:12:39.849 --> 00:12:43.604
in collaboration
with Sloan Kettering and UCSF.

00:12:43.628 --> 00:12:46.753
We took 90 men who had
biopsy-proven prostate cancer,

00:12:46.777 --> 00:12:50.217
who had elected, for reasons unrelated
to the study, not to have surgery.

00:12:50.241 --> 00:12:52.396
We could randomly divide them
into two groups,

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:54.052
and then we could have one group

00:12:54.076 --> 00:12:56.687
that is a nonintervention
control group to compare to,

00:12:56.711 --> 00:12:58.773
which you can't do with,
say, breast cancer,

00:12:58.797 --> 00:13:00.234
because everyone gets treated.

00:13:00.258 --> 00:13:01.557
We found that after a year,

00:13:01.581 --> 00:13:04.976
none of the experimental group patients
who made these lifestyle changes

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.151
needed treatment,

00:13:06.175 --> 00:13:09.367
while six of the control group patients
needed surgery or radiation.

00:13:09.391 --> 00:13:12.869
When we looked at their PSA levels,
which is a marker for prostate cancer,

00:13:12.893 --> 00:13:16.514
they got worse in the control group
but got better in the experimental group.

00:13:16.538 --> 00:13:18.594
And the differences
were highly significant.

00:13:18.618 --> 00:13:20.594
I wondered -- was there any relationship

00:13:20.618 --> 00:13:23.293
between how much people changed
their diet and lifestyle,

00:13:23.317 --> 00:13:24.700
whichever group they were in,

00:13:24.724 --> 00:13:25.875
and the changes in PSA?

00:13:25.899 --> 00:13:28.480
And sure enough, we found
a dose-response relationship,

00:13:28.504 --> 00:13:31.607
just like we did in the arterial
blockages in our cardiac studies.

00:13:31.631 --> 00:13:34.877
And in order for the PSA to go down,
they had to make big changes.

00:13:34.901 --> 00:13:37.290
I then wondered
if they're just changing their PSA,

00:13:37.314 --> 00:13:39.512
but it's not really affecting
the tumor growth.

00:13:39.536 --> 00:13:42.213
So we took some of their blood
serum and sent it to UCLA.

00:13:42.237 --> 00:13:44.864
They added it to a standard line
of prostate tumor cells

00:13:44.888 --> 00:13:46.134
growing in tissue culture,

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:49.453
and it inhibited the growth
seven times more in the experimental group

00:13:49.477 --> 00:13:51.773
than in the control group --
70 versus 9 percent.

00:13:51.797 --> 00:13:53.992
Finally, I wondered
if there's any relationship

00:13:54.016 --> 00:13:55.500
between how much people changed

00:13:55.524 --> 00:13:57.628
and how much it inhibited
their tumor growth,

00:13:57.652 --> 00:13:59.035
whichever group they were in.

00:13:59.059 --> 00:14:01.156
And this really got me
excited because again,

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.522
we found the same pattern:
the more people change,

00:14:03.546 --> 00:14:05.788
the more it affected
the growth of their tumors.

00:14:05.812 --> 00:14:09.199
Finally, we did MRI and MR spectroscopy
scans on some of these patients.

00:14:09.223 --> 00:14:11.606
The tumor activity
is shown in red in this patient,

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:15.394
and you can see clearly it's better a year
later, along with the PSA going down.

00:14:15.418 --> 00:14:16.992
If it's true for prostate cancer,

00:14:17.016 --> 00:14:19.306
it'll almost certainly be true
for breast cancer.

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.720
And whether or not you have
conventional treatment,

00:14:21.744 --> 00:14:25.606
in addition, if you make these changes,
it may help reduce the risk of recurrence.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.348
The last thing I want to talk about,

00:14:27.372 --> 00:14:29.673
apropos of the issue
of the pursuit of happiness,

00:14:29.697 --> 00:14:31.681
is that study after study has shown

00:14:31.705 --> 00:14:33.759
that people who are lonely
and depressed --

00:14:33.783 --> 00:14:36.546
and depression is the other
real epidemic in our culture --

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.333
are many times more likely
to get sick and die prematurely,

00:14:39.357 --> 00:14:42.454
in part because, as we talked about,
they're more likely to smoke,

00:14:42.478 --> 00:14:44.863
overeat, drink too much,
work too hard, and so on.

00:14:44.887 --> 00:14:47.817
But also, through mechanisms
that we don't fully understand,

00:14:47.841 --> 00:14:50.326
people who are lonely
and depressed are many times --

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.447
three to five to ten times
in some studies --

00:14:52.471 --> 00:14:54.527
more likely to get sick
and die prematurely.

00:14:54.551 --> 00:14:57.559
And depression is treatable.
We need to do something about that.

00:14:57.583 --> 00:15:00.728
Now on the other hand, anything
that promotes intimacy is healing.

00:15:00.752 --> 00:15:02.095
It can be sexual intimacy --

00:15:02.119 --> 00:15:04.499
I happen to think healing energy
and erotic energy

00:15:04.523 --> 00:15:06.802
are just different forms
of the same thing.

00:15:06.826 --> 00:15:09.660
Friendship, altruism,
compassion, service --

00:15:09.684 --> 00:15:11.784
all the perennial truths
that we talked about

00:15:11.808 --> 00:15:14.005
that are part of all religion
and all cultures,

00:15:14.029 --> 00:15:16.175
once you stop trying
to see the differences --

00:15:16.199 --> 00:15:18.779
these are the things
that are in our own self-interest,

00:15:18.803 --> 00:15:22.108
because they free us
from our suffering and our disease.

00:15:22.132 --> 00:15:25.612
And it's, in a sense,
the most selfish thing that we can do.

00:15:25.636 --> 00:15:29.053
Just to look at one study,
done by David Spiegel at Stanford.

00:15:29.077 --> 00:15:31.173
He took women with metastatic
breast cancer,

00:15:31.197 --> 00:15:33.033
randomly divided them into two groups.

00:15:33.057 --> 00:15:36.352
One group met for an hour and a half
once a week in a support group.

00:15:36.376 --> 00:15:38.243
It was a nurturing, loving environment,

00:15:38.267 --> 00:15:41.229
where they were encouraged
to let down their emotional defenses

00:15:41.253 --> 00:15:43.691
and talk about how awful it is
to have breast cancer

00:15:43.715 --> 00:15:46.885
with people who understood
because they were going through it too.

00:15:46.909 --> 00:15:48.441
They met once a week for a year.

00:15:48.465 --> 00:15:50.817
Five years later, those women
lived twice as long.

00:15:50.841 --> 00:15:53.276
And that was the only difference
between the groups.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.121
It was a randomized control study
published in "The Lancet."

00:15:56.145 --> 00:15:57.963
Other studies have shown this as well.

00:15:57.987 --> 00:16:00.946
So these simple things
that create intimacy are really healing.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:03.793
Even the word "healing"
comes from the root "to make whole."

00:16:03.817 --> 00:16:06.486
The word "yoga" comes
from the Sanskrit, meaning "union,"

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:07.896
"to yoke, to bring together."

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.316
The last slide I want to show you
is from -- again,

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.661
this swami that I studied
with for so many years.

00:16:12.685 --> 00:16:15.172
I did a combined oncology
and cardiology grand rounds

00:16:15.196 --> 00:16:18.199
at the University of Virginia
medical school a couple years ago.

00:16:18.223 --> 00:16:19.947
And at the end of it, somebody said,

00:16:19.971 --> 00:16:23.564
"Hey, Swami, what's the difference
between wellness and illness?"

00:16:23.588 --> 00:16:26.169
So he went up on the board
and wrote the word "illness"

00:16:26.193 --> 00:16:27.582
and circled the first letter,

00:16:27.606 --> 00:16:29.085
then wrote the word "wellness,"

00:16:29.109 --> 00:16:30.734
and circled the first two letters.

00:16:30.758 --> 00:16:33.386
To me, it's just shorthand
for what we're talking about:

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:36.788
that anything that creates a sense
of connection and community and love

00:16:36.812 --> 00:16:37.968
is really healing.

00:16:37.992 --> 00:16:42.065
And then we can enjoy our lives more fully
without getting sick in the process.

00:16:42.089 --> 00:16:43.248
Thank you.

00:16:43.272 --> 00:16:44.683
(Applause)
