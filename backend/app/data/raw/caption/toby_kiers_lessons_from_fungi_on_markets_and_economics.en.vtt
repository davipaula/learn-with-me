00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:17.792
So I stand before you
as an evolutionary biologist,

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:20.143
a professor of evolutionary biology,

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:25.184
which sounds like a rather fancy title,
if I may say so myself.

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:27.684
And I'm going to talk about two topics

00:00:27.708 --> 00:00:29.833
that aren't normally
talked about together,

00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:34.101
and that's market economies and fungi.

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:38.226
Or is it fun-GUY, or,
as we say in Europe now, fun-GEE?

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.542
There's still no consensus
on how to say this word.

00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:47.976
So I want you to imagine a market economy

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.643
that's 400 million years old,

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:57.476
one that's so ubiquitous that it operates
in almost every ecosystem of the world,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.726
so huge that it can connect
millions of traders simultaneously,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.518
and so persistent

00:01:05.542 --> 00:01:08.351
that it survived mass extinctions.

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:11.851
It's here, right now, under our feet.

00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:13.375
You just can't see it.

00:01:14.083 --> 00:01:17.143
And unlike human economies

00:01:17.167 --> 00:01:20.268
that rely on cognition to make decisions,

00:01:20.292 --> 00:01:24.643
traders in this market,
they beg, borrow, steal, cheat,

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:26.726
all in the absence of thought.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.518
So hidden from our eyes,

00:01:28.542 --> 00:01:32.351
plant roots are colonized by a fungus
called arbuscule mycorrhizae.

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:35.851
Now the fungus forms
these complex networks underground

00:01:35.875 --> 00:01:40.101
of fine filaments
thinner than even threads of cotton.

00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:42.101
So follow one of these fungi,

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:44.958
and it connects multiple
plants simultaneously.

00:01:45.792 --> 00:01:49.559
You can think of it
as an underground subway system,

00:01:49.583 --> 00:01:52.059
where each root is a station,

00:01:52.083 --> 00:01:55.351
where resources are loaded and unloaded.

00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:57.434
And it's also very dense,

00:01:57.458 --> 00:02:02.643
so roughly the length
of many meters, even a kilometer,

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:04.226
in a single gram of dirt.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.309
So that's the length of 10 football fields

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:11.476
in just a thimbleful of soil.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.768
And it's everywhere.

00:02:12.792 --> 00:02:18.768
So if you passed over a tree,
a shrub, a vine, even a tiny weed,

00:02:18.792 --> 00:02:21.726
you passed over a mycorrhizal network.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.434
Roughly 80 percent of all plant species

00:02:25.458 --> 00:02:29.268
are associated with these
mycorrhizal fungi.

00:02:29.292 --> 00:02:33.143
So what does a root covered in fungi

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:35.809
have to do with our global economy?

00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:40.393
And why as an evolutionary biologist
have I spent the last 10 years of my life

00:02:40.417 --> 00:02:42.768
learning economic jargon?

00:02:42.792 --> 00:02:45.208
Well, the first thing
you need to understand

00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:50.684
is that trade deals
made by plant and fungal partners

00:02:50.708 --> 00:02:52.893
are surprisingly similar

00:02:52.917 --> 00:02:55.143
to those made by us,

00:02:55.167 --> 00:02:57.559
but perhaps even more strategic.

00:02:57.583 --> 00:02:59.309
You see, plant and fungal partners,

00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:03.726
they're not exchanging stocks and bonds,

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.184
they're exchanging essential resources,

00:03:06.208 --> 00:03:09.226
and for the fungus,
that's sugars and fats.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.809
It gets all of its carbon
directly from the plant partner.

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:19.143
So much carbon, so every year,
roughly five billion tons of carbon

00:03:19.167 --> 00:03:23.684
from plants go into
this network underground.

00:03:23.708 --> 00:03:28.684
For the root, what they need
is phosphorus and nitrogen,

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:30.518
so by exchanging their carbon

00:03:30.542 --> 00:03:35.708
they get access to all of the nutrients
collected by that fungal network.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.684
So to make the trade,

00:03:38.708 --> 00:03:43.434
the fungus penetrates
into the root cell of the host

00:03:43.458 --> 00:03:47.184
and forms a tiny structure
called an arbuscule,

00:03:47.208 --> 00:03:49.851
which is Latin for "little tree."

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:54.184
Now, you can think of this
as the physical stock exchange

00:03:54.208 --> 00:03:55.476
of the trade market.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.684
So up until now, it seems very harmonious.

00:03:58.708 --> 00:04:01.559
Right? I scratch your back,
you scratch mine,

00:04:01.583 --> 00:04:03.726
both partners get what they need.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.934
But here is where we need to pause

00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:11.851
and understand the power
of evolution and natural selection.

00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:16.934
You see, there's no room
for amateur traders on this market.

00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.726
Making the right trade strategy

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.958
determines who lives and who dies.

00:04:24.417 --> 00:04:27.000
Now, I use the word strategy,

00:04:28.083 --> 00:04:31.559
but of course plant and fungi,
they don't have brains.

00:04:31.583 --> 00:04:33.059
They're making these exchanges

00:04:33.083 --> 00:04:36.708
in the absence of anything
that we would consider as thought.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.851
But, as scientists,
we use behavioral terms

00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:46.143
such as strategy

00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:50.268
to describe behaviors
to certain conditions,

00:04:50.292 --> 00:04:52.393
actions and reactions

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:57.583
that are actually programmed
into the DNA of the organism.

00:04:58.458 --> 00:05:01.226
So I started studying
these trade strategies

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.809
when I was 19 years old

00:05:03.833 --> 00:05:07.351
and I was living in
the tropical rainforests of Panama.

00:05:07.375 --> 00:05:13.518
Now, everybody at the time was interested
in this incredible diversity aboveground.

00:05:13.542 --> 00:05:16.809
And it was hyperdiversity.
These are tropical rainforests.

00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:20.476
But I was interested
in the complexity belowground.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.893
We knew that the networks existed,
and we knew they were important,

00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:26.851
and I'm going to say it again,
by important I mean important,

00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:29.559
so the basis of all plant nutrition

00:05:29.583 --> 00:05:32.792
for all the diversity
that you do see aboveground.

00:05:34.083 --> 00:05:38.601
But at the time, we didn't know
how these networks worked.

00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:40.809
We didn't know how they functioned.

00:05:40.833 --> 00:05:45.893
Why did only certain plants
interact with certain fungi?

00:05:45.917 --> 00:05:48.601
So fast-forward to when
I started my own group,

00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:51.768
and we really began to play
with this trade market.

00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:53.851
You see, we would manipulate conditions.

00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:57.893
We would create a good trading partner
by growing a plant in the sun

00:05:57.917 --> 00:06:00.934
and a poor trading partner
by growing it in the shade.

00:06:00.958 --> 00:06:04.226
We would then connect these
with a fungal network.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.934
And we found that the fungi
were consistently good

00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:12.101
at discriminating among
good and bad trading partners.

00:06:12.125 --> 00:06:17.000
They would allocate more resources
to the host plant giving them more carbon.

00:06:18.042 --> 00:06:20.809
Now, we would run
the reciprocal experiments

00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:24.643
where we would inoculate a host plant
with good and bad fungi,

00:06:24.667 --> 00:06:28.833
and they were also good at discriminating
between these trade partners.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:36.101
So what you have there is the perfect
conditions for a market to emerge.

00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:38.018
It's a simple market,

00:06:38.042 --> 00:06:40.226
but it's a market nonetheless,

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.333
where the better trading partner
is consistently favored.

00:06:45.708 --> 00:06:47.184
But is it a fair market?

00:06:47.208 --> 00:06:50.934
Now this is where you need
to understand that, like humans,

00:06:50.958 --> 00:06:55.167
plants and fungi
are incredibly opportunistic.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:01.268
There's evidence that the fungus,
once it penetrates into the plant cell,

00:07:01.292 --> 00:07:06.393
it can actually hijack the plant's
own nutrient uptake system.

00:07:06.417 --> 00:07:09.476
It does this by suppressing
the plant's own ability

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.601
to take up nutrients from the soil.

00:07:12.625 --> 00:07:17.226
So this creates a dependency
of the plant on the fungus.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.184
It's a false addiction, of sorts,

00:07:20.208 --> 00:07:22.893
whereby the plant has to feed the fungus

00:07:22.917 --> 00:07:27.250
just to get access to the resources
right around its own root.

00:07:28.333 --> 00:07:33.934
There's also evidence that the fungi are
good at inflating the price of nutrients.

00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:38.143
They do this by extracting
the nutrients from the soil,

00:07:38.167 --> 00:07:41.268
but then rather than
trading them with the host,

00:07:41.292 --> 00:07:43.518
they hoard them in their network,

00:07:43.542 --> 00:07:49.042
so this makes them unavailable
to the plant and other competing fungi.

00:07:49.792 --> 00:07:51.309
So basic economics,

00:07:51.333 --> 00:07:55.476
as resource availability goes down,
the value goes up.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.434
The plant is forced to pay more
for the same amount of resources.

00:08:00.458 --> 00:08:03.684
But it's not all in favor of the fungus.

00:08:03.708 --> 00:08:06.976
Plants can be extremely cunning as well.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.309
There are some orchids --

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:11.268
and I always think orchids somehow
seem like the most devious

00:08:11.292 --> 00:08:13.184
of the plant species in the world --

00:08:13.208 --> 00:08:15.559
and there are some orchids

00:08:15.583 --> 00:08:19.393
that just tap directly into the network

00:08:19.417 --> 00:08:21.809
and steal all their carbon.

00:08:21.833 --> 00:08:26.268
So these orchids, they don't even make
green leaves to photosynthesize.

00:08:26.292 --> 00:08:27.643
They're just white.

00:08:27.667 --> 00:08:29.809
So rather than photosynthesizing,

00:08:29.833 --> 00:08:31.268
tap into the network,

00:08:31.292 --> 00:08:32.726
steal the carbon

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.625
and give nothing in return.

00:08:35.583 --> 00:08:38.351
Now I think it's fair to say
that these types of parasites

00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:40.934
also flourish in our human markets.

00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:44.893
So as we began to decode these strategies,

00:08:44.917 --> 00:08:46.768
we learned some lessons.

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:52.101
And the first one was that
there's no altruism in this system.

00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:54.018
There's no trade favors.

00:08:54.042 --> 00:08:57.684
We don't see strong evidence

00:08:57.708 --> 00:09:02.476
of the fungus helping
dying or struggling plants

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:08.875
unless it directly benefits
the fungus itself.

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:13.434
Now I'm not saying
if this is good or bad.

00:09:13.458 --> 00:09:17.976
Unlike humans, a fungus, of course,
cannot judge its own morality.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.268
And as a biologist,

00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:26.059
I'm not advocating for these types
of ruthless neoliberal market dynamics

00:09:26.083 --> 00:09:27.667
enacted by the fungi.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.750
But the trade system,

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.375
it provides us with a benchmark

00:09:36.833 --> 00:09:40.184
to study what an economy looks like

00:09:40.208 --> 00:09:43.018
when it's been shaped by natural selection

00:09:43.042 --> 00:09:46.684
for hundreds of millions of years

00:09:46.708 --> 00:09:49.351
in the absence of morality,

00:09:49.375 --> 00:09:51.934
when strategies are just based

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:56.809
on the gathering and processing
of information,

00:09:56.833 --> 00:09:59.268
uncontaminated by cognition:

00:09:59.292 --> 00:10:01.809
no jealousy, no spite,

00:10:01.833 --> 00:10:03.708
but no hope, no joy.

00:10:04.583 --> 00:10:06.976
So we've made progress

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.559
in decoding the most basic
trade principles at this point,

00:10:11.583 --> 00:10:14.726
but as scientists we always
want to take it one step further,

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:19.500
and we're interested in more complex
economic dilemmas.

00:10:20.417 --> 00:10:24.500
And specifically we're interested
in the effects of inequality.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:31.184
So inequality has really become
a defining feature

00:10:31.208 --> 00:10:33.542
of today's economic landscape.

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:36.809
But the challenges of inequality

00:10:36.833 --> 00:10:39.476
are not unique to the human world.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.268
I think as humans we tend to think
that everything's unique to us,

00:10:43.292 --> 00:10:45.934
but organisms in nature

00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:51.226
must face relentless variation
in their access to resources.

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.518
How does a fungus
that can again be meters long

00:10:54.542 --> 00:10:59.434
change its trade strategy
when it's exposed simultaneously

00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:02.393
to a rich patch and a poor patch?

00:11:02.417 --> 00:11:03.684
And, more generally,

00:11:03.708 --> 00:11:06.976
how do organisms in nature
use trade to their advantage

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.726
when they're faced with uncertainty

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.268
in terms of their access to resources?

00:11:12.292 --> 00:11:14.476
Here's where I have
to let you in on a secret:

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:19.393
studying trade underground
is incredibly difficult.

00:11:19.417 --> 00:11:25.434
You can't see where or when
important trade deals take place.

00:11:25.458 --> 00:11:29.434
So our group helped pioneer
a method, a technology,

00:11:29.458 --> 00:11:34.101
whereby we could tag nutrients
with nanoparticles,

00:11:34.125 --> 00:11:38.059
fluorescing nanoparticles
called quantum dots.

00:11:38.083 --> 00:11:40.476
What the quantum dots allow us to do

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.351
is actually light up the nutrients

00:11:43.375 --> 00:11:46.518
so we can visually track their movements

00:11:46.542 --> 00:11:48.934
across the fungal network

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.101
and into the host root.

00:11:51.125 --> 00:11:54.768
So this allows us finally
to see the unseen,

00:11:54.792 --> 00:12:00.101
so we can study how fungi bargain
at a small scale with their plant hosts.

00:12:00.125 --> 00:12:01.768
So to study inequality,

00:12:01.792 --> 00:12:03.934
we exposed a fungal network

00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:07.851
to these varying concentrations
of fluorescing phosphorus,

00:12:07.875 --> 00:12:11.559
mimicking patches
of abundance and scarcity

00:12:11.583 --> 00:12:13.583
across this artificial landscape.

00:12:14.458 --> 00:12:17.583
We then carefully quantified fungal trade.

00:12:19.167 --> 00:12:20.750
And we found two things.

00:12:21.667 --> 00:12:23.351
The first thing we found

00:12:23.375 --> 00:12:28.125
was that inequality encouraged
the fungus to trade more.

00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:34.059
So I can use the word "encouraged"
or "stimulated" or "forced,"

00:12:34.083 --> 00:12:37.351
but the bottom line is
that compared to control conditions,

00:12:37.375 --> 00:12:41.625
inequality was associated
with higher levels of trade.

00:12:43.292 --> 00:12:45.143
This is important,

00:12:45.167 --> 00:12:50.309
because it suggests that evolving
a trade partnership in nature

00:12:50.333 --> 00:12:54.875
can help organisms cope with
the uncertainty of accessing resources.

00:12:55.833 --> 00:13:01.375
Second, we found that,
exposed to inequality,

00:13:02.792 --> 00:13:07.726
the fungus would move resources
from the rich patch of the network,

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:11.893
actively transport them
to the poor side of the network.

00:13:11.917 --> 00:13:13.559
Now, of course, we could see this

00:13:13.583 --> 00:13:16.476
because the patches
were fluorescing in different colors.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:21.000
So at first, this result
was incredibly puzzling.

00:13:22.042 --> 00:13:25.893
Was it to help
the poor side of the network?

00:13:25.917 --> 00:13:31.768
No. We found that the fungus gained more
by first moving the resources

00:13:31.792 --> 00:13:34.351
to where demand was higher.

00:13:34.375 --> 00:13:40.726
Simply by changing where
across the network the fungus was trading,

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:44.083
it could manipulate
the value of those resources.

00:13:45.375 --> 00:13:51.601
Now this stimulated us to really
dig deeper into how information is shared.

00:13:51.625 --> 00:13:54.309
It suggests a high level
of sophistication,

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:57.476
or at least a medium level
of sophistication

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.601
in an organism with no cognition.

00:14:00.625 --> 00:14:06.018
How is it that a fungus can sense
market conditions across its network

00:14:06.042 --> 00:14:10.059
and then make calculations
of where and when to trade?

00:14:10.083 --> 00:14:14.643
So we wanted to look about information
and how it's shared across this network,

00:14:14.667 --> 00:14:17.292
how the fungus integrates cues.

00:14:19.208 --> 00:14:24.601
So to do that, what you need to do is
dive deep in and get a higher resolution

00:14:24.625 --> 00:14:26.375
into the network itself.

00:14:27.375 --> 00:14:31.768
We began to study complex flows
inside the hyphal network.

00:14:31.792 --> 00:14:35.976
So what you're looking at right now
is a living fungal network

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.101
with the cellular contents
moving across it.

00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:42.059
This is happening in real time,

00:14:42.083 --> 00:14:44.434
so you can see the time stamp up there.

00:14:44.458 --> 00:14:47.143
So this is happening right now.
This video isn't sped up.

00:14:47.167 --> 00:14:49.601
This is what is happening
under our feet right now.

00:14:49.625 --> 00:14:52.934
And there's a couple of things
that I want you to notice.

00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:57.559
It speeds up, it slows down,
it switches directions.

00:14:57.583 --> 00:15:00.351
So we're working now with biophysicists

00:15:00.375 --> 00:15:03.768
to try to dissect this complexity.

00:15:03.792 --> 00:15:07.768
How is the fungus using
these complex flow patterns

00:15:07.792 --> 00:15:10.434
to share and process information

00:15:10.458 --> 00:15:12.625
and make these trade decisions?

00:15:13.875 --> 00:15:19.292
Are fungi better at making
trade calculations than us?

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:24.226
Now here's where we can potentially
borrow models from nature.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.559
We're increasingly reliant
on computer algorithms

00:15:27.583 --> 00:15:32.184
to make us profitable trades
in split-second time scales.

00:15:32.208 --> 00:15:35.768
But computer algorithms and fungi,

00:15:35.792 --> 00:15:39.583
they both operate in similar,
uncognitive ways.

00:15:40.875 --> 00:15:44.101
The fungi just happens to be
a living machine.

00:15:44.125 --> 00:15:47.434
What would happen
if we compare and compete

00:15:47.458 --> 00:15:50.601
the trading strategies of these two?

00:15:50.625 --> 00:15:51.976
Who would win?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.476
The tiny capitalist that's been around

00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:00.851
since before and
the fall of the dinosaurs?

00:16:00.875 --> 00:16:02.708
My money is on the fungus.

00:16:03.417 --> 00:16:04.684
Thank you.

00:16:04.708 --> 00:16:08.000
(Applause)
