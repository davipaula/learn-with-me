00:00:06.857 --> 00:00:08.747
For 3 billion people around the world,

00:00:08.747 --> 00:00:12.457
seafood provides a significant source 
of protein and nutrition.

00:00:12.457 --> 00:00:16.857
But recent studies show that 33% of wild 
fisheries are overfished,

00:00:16.857 --> 00:00:20.987
while another 60% are fished at their 
maximum capacity.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:23.427
In fact, over half the seafood we eat–

00:00:23.427 --> 00:00:26.027
from finfish and shellfish to 
seaweed and algae–

00:00:26.027 --> 00:00:27.687
isn’t caught in the wild.

00:00:27.687 --> 00:00:31.287
It’s grown through aquaculture, 
or aquatic farming.

00:00:31.287 --> 00:00:34.327
Farmed seafood is one of the 
fastest-growing food industries,

00:00:34.327 --> 00:00:38.067
expanding in volume by 5.8% each year.

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:42.137
But different methods of aquaculture come 
with different advantages and issues–

00:00:42.137 --> 00:00:46.697
some of which echo the serious problems 
we’ve seen in industrial agriculture.

00:00:46.697 --> 00:00:51.000
So how can we avoid repeating the mistakes
we’ve made on land, at sea?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.823
What aquaculture approaches are we 
currently using,

00:00:53.823 --> 00:00:57.923
and what does a sustainable way 
to farm the ocean really look like?

00:00:57.923 --> 00:01:02.563
One of the most common aquaculture 
methods involves large pens made of nets,

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:08.283
where fish are farmed offshore in floating
cages roughly 1000 square meters in size.

00:01:08.283 --> 00:01:11.586
Commonly employed off the coast of Chile
and in the fjords of Norway,

00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:14.256
these fish, like many industrially 
farmed animals,

00:01:14.256 --> 00:01:17.186
occupy stressful, overcrowded pens.

00:01:17.186 --> 00:01:19.066
They produce massive amounts of waste,

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.476
polluting the surrounding areas

00:01:20.476 --> 00:01:24.006
and potentially spreading diseases
to wild species.

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:27.386
Worse still, since the antibiotics 
employed to fight disease

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:29.236
aren’t fully absorbed by the fish,

00:01:29.236 --> 00:01:32.496
they get excreted back 
into the environment.

00:01:32.496 --> 00:01:35.636
Net pens are also susceptible to escapes,

00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:39.076
unleashing huge numbers of fish which 
compete for resources

00:01:39.076 --> 00:01:43.166
and weaken the local gene pool 
with genes adapted for captivity.

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:48.186
Escaped fish can even disrupt local 
ecosystems as invasive species.

00:01:48.186 --> 00:01:49.416
Other techniques,

00:01:49.416 --> 00:01:54.026
such as man-made coastal ponds commonly
used for shrimp farming in Southeast Asia,

00:01:54.026 --> 00:01:56.535
create additional environmental problems.

00:01:56.535 --> 00:02:01.245
Just like net pens, these ponds are prone
to spreading pollution and disease.

00:02:01.245 --> 00:02:04.648
Their construction also frequently 
destroys important ecosystems

00:02:04.648 --> 00:02:06.528
like mangroves and marshes,

00:02:06.528 --> 00:02:08.748
which protect coastal areas from storms,

00:02:08.748 --> 00:02:13.008
provide habitats, and absorb tons 
of greenhouse gases.

00:02:13.008 --> 00:02:16.380
One way to solve these problems is to farm
fish on land

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.870
in completely contained systems.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.770
Tanks and raceways can recirculate and 
filter water to prevent pollution.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.976
But even fully contained facilities still 
contend with another major hurdle:

00:02:27.976 --> 00:02:29.180
fishmeal.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.810
About 10% of the seafood caught globally
is used to feed animals,

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.420
including carnivorous farmed fish.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.050
Researchers are working on fish feed made 
of insects and plant-based proteins,

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.880
but for now many inland fish farms 
are connected to overfishing.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.450
All these obstacles can make sustainable 
aquaculture feel a long way off,

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.056
but innovative farmers are finding new 
ways to responsibly farm the seas.

00:02:54.056 --> 00:02:58.468
The most promising solution of all 
may be to look lower on the food chain.

00:02:58.468 --> 00:03:01.898
Instead of cramming large, carnivorous 
fish into pens,

00:03:01.898 --> 00:03:04.238
we can work with natural ocean systems

00:03:04.238 --> 00:03:08.128
to produce huge amounts of shellfish 
and seaweeds.

00:03:08.128 --> 00:03:12.268
These low-maintenance flora and fauna 
don’t need to be fed at all.

00:03:12.268 --> 00:03:15.208
In fact, they naturally improve 
water quality,

00:03:15.208 --> 00:03:19.828
filtering it as they feed off of sunlight 
and nutrients in the seawater.

00:03:19.828 --> 00:03:22.236
By absorbing carbon through 
photosynthesis,

00:03:22.236 --> 00:03:24.286
these farms help battle climate change,

00:03:24.286 --> 00:03:26.746
and reduce local ocean acidification

00:03:26.746 --> 00:03:30.466
while creating habitats for other 
species to thrive.

00:03:30.466 --> 00:03:32.746
Shifting to restorative ocean farming

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:35.526
could provide good jobs for 
coastal communities,

00:03:35.526 --> 00:03:38.713
and support healthy plant and 
shellfish-based diets

00:03:38.713 --> 00:03:41.343
that have an incredibly 
low carbon footprint.

00:03:41.343 --> 00:03:42.553
In just 5 months,

00:03:42.553 --> 00:03:47.573
4,000 square meters of ocean can 
produce 25 tons of seaweed

00:03:47.573 --> 00:03:51.043
and 250,000 of shellfish.

00:03:51.043 --> 00:03:52.813
With the right distribution network,

00:03:52.813 --> 00:03:56.433
a series of small farms, collectively 
the size of Washington State

00:03:56.433 --> 00:03:58.463
could feed the planet.

00:03:58.463 --> 00:04:01.353
Farms like these are already popping up
around the globe,

00:04:01.353 --> 00:04:03.733
and a new generation of farmers is 
stepping up

00:04:03.733 --> 00:04:06.933
to pursue a more sustainable future.

00:04:06.933 --> 00:04:07.983
Done properly,

00:04:07.983 --> 00:04:11.983
regenerative ocean farming could play
a vital role in helping our oceans,

00:04:11.983 --> 00:04:14.613
our climate, and ourselves.
