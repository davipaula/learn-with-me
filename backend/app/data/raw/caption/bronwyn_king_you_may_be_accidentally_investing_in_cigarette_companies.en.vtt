00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.908
In 2001, I was a brand new, shiny doctor,
planning to save the world.

00:00:19.563 --> 00:00:23.830
My first job was working for three months
on a lung cancer unit.

00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:27.637
Nearly all of my patients
were smokers or ex-smokers,

00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:31.177
and most of them had started
smoking when they were children

00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:32.923
or in their early teens.

00:00:33.427 --> 00:00:37.014
And despite living
in a beautiful, wealthy country,

00:00:37.038 --> 00:00:40.776
with access to the most
sophisticated medicines,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.800
nearly every single one
of my patients died.

00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:46.276
Everyone knows tobacco is bad,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.355
but when you see the impact
firsthand, day-by-day,

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.799
it leaves a very deep impression.

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:56.172
Ten years later,
I'm a radiation oncologist,

00:00:56.196 --> 00:00:59.497
fully aware of the suffering
caused by tobacco.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.989
I'm sitting at the hospital cafeteria,
having my first ever meeting

00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:07.085
with a representative
from my superannuation fund.

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:09.180
It was thrilling,
I'm sure you can imagine.

00:01:09.204 --> 00:01:10.744
(Laughter)

00:01:10.768 --> 00:01:13.379
He tells me I'm in the default option.

00:01:13.403 --> 00:01:16.560
And I said, "Option? Does that mean
there are other options?"

00:01:16.584 --> 00:01:20.306
He looked at me,
rolled his eyes, and said,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.306
"Well, there is this one greenie option

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.949
for people who have a problem with
investing in mining, alcohol or tobacco."

00:01:29.307 --> 00:01:31.006
I said, "Did you just say tobacco?"

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.180
He said, "Yes."

00:01:32.673 --> 00:01:36.117
I said, "So, are you telling me
I'm currently investing in tobacco?"

00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:39.069
And he said, "Oh, yes, everyone is."

00:01:40.292 --> 00:01:44.108
When you invest in a company,
you own part of that company.

00:01:44.589 --> 00:01:48.049
You want that company to grow
and succeed and thrive.

00:01:48.073 --> 00:01:50.565
You want that company
to attract new customers,

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:53.232
you want that company
to sell more of its products.

00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:55.601
And when it comes to tobacco,

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:58.892
I couldn't think of anything
that I wanted less.

00:01:59.846 --> 00:02:02.355
Now, I know you can only see
one person standing here

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:05.379
on this big red dot,
on this enormous stage.

00:02:05.942 --> 00:02:09.034
But instead, I would like you to imagine

00:02:09.942 --> 00:02:13.514
that you're looking
at seven million people

00:02:13.538 --> 00:02:16.577
crammed up here beside me today.

00:02:17.538 --> 00:02:24.291
Seven million people across the world
have died as a result of tobacco

00:02:24.315 --> 00:02:26.672
in the past year alone.

00:02:27.776 --> 00:02:30.602
Just imagine, if a brand new industry
were launched today,

00:02:30.626 --> 00:02:32.086
and by the end of next June,

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.016
that industry's products
had killed seven million people.

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:42.160
Would any of us invest
in that new, deadly industry?

00:02:43.186 --> 00:02:47.265
Tobacco is one of the most
pressing global issues of our time,

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:52.148
and most of us are far more complicit
in the problem than we may realize.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.905
So, the super fund representative
explained to me

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:57.897
that tobacco companies would be found

00:02:57.921 --> 00:03:01.966
in the international shares portion
of my portfolio.

00:03:02.386 --> 00:03:05.723
So I asked him, "Well,
which international shares do I have?"

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.268
He got back to me
two weeks later with this list:

00:03:09.292 --> 00:03:13.178
my number one holding
in international shares

00:03:13.202 --> 00:03:15.135
was British American Tobacco.

00:03:15.805 --> 00:03:18.225
Number two, Imperial Tobacco.

00:03:18.575 --> 00:03:20.566
Number four, Philip Morris.

00:03:21.165 --> 00:03:23.886
And number five,
the Swedish Match company.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.609
Four of the top five companies
were tobacco companies,

00:03:26.633 --> 00:03:28.886
my investments, an oncologist.

00:03:29.458 --> 00:03:31.760
And then I realized it wasn't just me.

00:03:31.784 --> 00:03:33.672
It was all members of my super fund.

00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:37.378
And then I realized it wasn't just
my super fund, it was all of them.

00:03:37.402 --> 00:03:40.086
And then I realized,
it wasn't just superannuation funds,

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.204
it was banks, insurers and fund managers.

00:03:43.228 --> 00:03:46.101
And then I realized
it wasn't just Australia.

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:49.037
It was the entire global finance sector,

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:51.696
completely tangled up
with the tobacco industry.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.927
The industry that makes products
that kill seven million people every year.

00:03:57.475 --> 00:04:00.642
So I started discussing the issue
with my superannuation fund,

00:04:00.666 --> 00:04:02.776
and I've been discussing it ever since.

00:04:03.125 --> 00:04:06.863
Finance leaders have many challenging
issues to deal with, these days.

00:04:06.887 --> 00:04:09.688
So I suggest they adopt a framework

00:04:09.712 --> 00:04:12.831
that clearly articulates
why it is reasonable

00:04:12.855 --> 00:04:15.236
to take a strong position on tobacco.

00:04:15.847 --> 00:04:20.449
I suggest finance leaders
ask a suite of three questions

00:04:20.473 --> 00:04:24.006
of any company in which
they might invest our money.

00:04:24.465 --> 00:04:25.989
Question one:

00:04:26.013 --> 00:04:30.630
Can the product made
by the company be used safely?

00:04:31.156 --> 00:04:34.036
"No" is the answer for tobacco companies.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.482
Zero is the only safe number
of cigarettes for a human being.

00:04:37.506 --> 00:04:39.672
It could not be more black and white.

00:04:40.291 --> 00:04:41.815
Question two:

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:46.887
Is the problem caused by the company
so significant on a global level

00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:50.177
that it is subject
to a UN treaty or convention?

00:04:50.974 --> 00:04:53.093
"Yes" is the answer for tobacco.

00:04:53.117 --> 00:04:56.101
Indeed there is a UN tobacco treaty

00:04:56.125 --> 00:04:59.551
that has been ratified by 180 countries.

00:05:00.215 --> 00:05:01.922
The treaty was created

00:05:01.946 --> 00:05:05.613
because of the catastrophic
global impact of tobacco.

00:05:06.192 --> 00:05:10.236
The current forecast
is that the world is on track

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.650
for one billion tobacco-related
deaths this century.

00:05:15.292 --> 00:05:16.558
One billion deaths.

00:05:16.998 --> 00:05:19.198
There's only seven billion of us.

00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:23.968
Question three relates
to the concept of engagement.

00:05:24.355 --> 00:05:28.172
Many financial organizations genuinely
want to be good corporate citizens.

00:05:28.577 --> 00:05:31.323
They want to use their shareholder power

00:05:31.347 --> 00:05:33.657
to sit down with companies,
engage with them,

00:05:33.681 --> 00:05:35.807
and encourage them to do better things.

00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:37.387
So the question is:

00:05:37.411 --> 00:05:42.192
Can engagement with the company
be an effective lever for change?

00:05:43.026 --> 00:05:45.827
"No" is the answer for tobacco companies.

00:05:46.153 --> 00:05:48.774
Engagement with
the tobacco industry is futile.

00:05:49.157 --> 00:05:50.935
The only acceptable outcome would be

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:54.293
if tobacco companies ceased
their primary business.

00:05:54.712 --> 00:05:57.392
In fact, engagement
with the tobacco industry

00:05:57.416 --> 00:06:01.236
has never led to less human death.

00:06:02.387 --> 00:06:05.664
When we consider that framework,
three simple questions,

00:06:05.688 --> 00:06:09.093
we can see that is reasonable
and defensible

00:06:09.117 --> 00:06:14.293
to take a strong position and exclude
investment in the tobacco industry.

00:06:15.663 --> 00:06:18.028
In addition to the UN tobacco treaty,

00:06:18.052 --> 00:06:22.374
there is, in fact, another global treaty
that demands that we act on tobacco.

00:06:22.972 --> 00:06:27.744
In 2015, the UN adopted
the Sustainable Development Goals.

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:29.704
Now, we're talking about tobacco,

00:06:29.728 --> 00:06:32.467
and I know you're going to jump
straight to number three:

00:06:32.491 --> 00:06:33.807
good health and well-being.

00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:36.144
And indeed, ramping up
tobacco control regulation

00:06:36.168 --> 00:06:38.519
is essential if we're going
to achieve that goal.

00:06:38.543 --> 00:06:40.879
However, look a bit more deeply,

00:06:40.903 --> 00:06:45.934
and you will find that 13
of the 17 goals cannot be achieved

00:06:45.958 --> 00:06:49.554
unless there is a major shake-up
of the tobacco industry.

00:06:50.323 --> 00:06:53.312
Personally, my favorite goal is number 17:

00:06:53.336 --> 00:06:55.136
partnerships for the goals.

00:06:55.478 --> 00:07:01.160
At present, we have the entire global
health sector doing everything it can

00:07:01.184 --> 00:07:05.077
to help the tidal wave of patients
suffering as a result of tobacco.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.752
But that said, in the past year alone,
seven million people have died,

00:07:08.776 --> 00:07:10.712
so clearly, that is not enough.

00:07:11.323 --> 00:07:14.887
We also have governments
aligned on tobacco, 180 of them,

00:07:14.911 --> 00:07:18.910
busily trying to implement
the provisions of the UN tobacco treaty.

00:07:18.934 --> 00:07:21.378
But that, too, is not enough.

00:07:22.038 --> 00:07:28.339
If the global finance sector continues
to lend money to tobacco companies,

00:07:28.363 --> 00:07:30.720
to invest in tobacco companies,

00:07:30.744 --> 00:07:33.736
and to strive to profit
from tobacco companies,

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.027
we are working against each other.

00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:38.799
Now, if we are going to disrupt

00:07:38.823 --> 00:07:42.522
what doctors call
"the global tobacco epidemic,"

00:07:42.546 --> 00:07:46.664
we need every sector of society
to stand side by side

00:07:46.688 --> 00:07:48.555
and be part of the solution.

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:51.631
So I call on finance leaders

00:07:51.655 --> 00:07:55.385
to implement a framework
to deal with sensitive issues.

00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:58.749
And I call on them to uphold
global conventions.

00:07:59.307 --> 00:08:01.998
But in addition, there are business risks.

00:08:02.022 --> 00:08:06.720
Pure financial risks, associated with
being invested in the tobacco industry

00:08:06.744 --> 00:08:08.156
over the long term,

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.249
and I ask finance leaders
to consider them.

00:08:12.006 --> 00:08:16.097
The first risk is that fewer
and fewer people will smoke,

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:19.188
as a result of increasing
tobacco regulation.

00:08:19.891 --> 00:08:23.586
When these warnings were put
on cigarette packets in Canada,

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.172
[Tobacco can make you impotent]

00:08:25.196 --> 00:08:28.874
the first response of smokers was
to give them right back to the salespeople

00:08:28.898 --> 00:08:32.481
and say, "Could you please just give me
the ones that say they'll kill me?"

00:08:32.505 --> 00:08:34.058
(Laughter)

00:08:34.082 --> 00:08:37.819
Regulation gets noticed,
regulation reduces consumption,

00:08:37.843 --> 00:08:42.307
and we have 180 countries
committed to more regulation.

00:08:43.061 --> 00:08:46.188
Let's talk about litigation
and the risk that presents.

00:08:46.664 --> 00:08:50.807
At present, it's the business model
of the tobacco industry

00:08:50.831 --> 00:08:52.498
that is being challenged.

00:08:53.133 --> 00:08:58.056
Currently, the tobacco industry
externalizes all of the health costs

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.984
associated with tobacco.

00:09:00.326 --> 00:09:03.714
Governments pay,
communities pay, you pay, I pay.

00:09:04.222 --> 00:09:08.249
The tobacco industry
externalizes all those costs,

00:09:08.273 --> 00:09:12.082
with an estimated one trillion
US dollars per year.

00:09:12.527 --> 00:09:15.727
Yet they internalize
and privatize the profits.

00:09:16.614 --> 00:09:19.520
In 2015, in Quebec province,

00:09:19.544 --> 00:09:21.751
the courts determined
that the tobacco industry

00:09:21.775 --> 00:09:24.575
was indeed responsible
for those health costs,

00:09:24.599 --> 00:09:27.075
and ordered them to pay
15 billion US dollars.

00:09:27.457 --> 00:09:29.236
That case is under appeal.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:35.379
But it begs the question,
why should any of us, in any country,

00:09:35.403 --> 00:09:38.878
be paying for the costs
of the tobacco industry?

00:09:40.301 --> 00:09:44.062
Let's move on to supply chain
and the risk there.

00:09:44.086 --> 00:09:45.959
It is not well known

00:09:45.983 --> 00:09:51.482
that the tobacco industry
significantly relies on child labor.

00:09:53.394 --> 00:09:56.768
In March 2017, the International
Labour Organization

00:09:56.792 --> 00:09:59.578
issued a report which stated:

00:09:59.602 --> 00:10:04.665
"In tobacco-growing communities,
child labor is rampant."

00:10:05.499 --> 00:10:06.991
The US Department of Labor

00:10:07.015 --> 00:10:13.499
currently lists 16 countries
that use children to produce tobacco leaf.

00:10:14.155 --> 00:10:16.623
Scrutiny of supply chains is intensifying,

00:10:16.647 --> 00:10:19.877
and that cannot continue
to escape public attention.

00:10:20.218 --> 00:10:23.395
Finally, there is also
reputation risk to consider

00:10:23.419 --> 00:10:28.410
for individuals and organizations
that continue to maintain an affiliation

00:10:28.434 --> 00:10:29.942
with the tobacco industry.

00:10:29.966 --> 00:10:31.687
In countless surveys,

00:10:31.711 --> 00:10:35.911
the tobacco industry ranks
as the world's least reputable industry.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.919
Let's just look at the impact on children.

00:10:39.355 --> 00:10:42.983
Globally, every single day,

00:10:43.007 --> 00:10:48.426
it is estimated that
100,000 children start smoking.

00:10:48.807 --> 00:10:52.648
That's enough children to fit
inside the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

00:10:53.188 --> 00:10:56.799
And most of those children
are from the poorest communities on earth.

00:10:57.252 --> 00:11:01.950
Here in Australia, the average age
that people start smoking

00:11:01.974 --> 00:11:04.545
is 16 years and two months.

00:11:05.338 --> 00:11:07.879
They look pretty young to me,
but the worst thing here

00:11:07.903 --> 00:11:10.791
is that while we don't have
data from every country on earth,

00:11:10.815 --> 00:11:12.973
we believe that is the oldest age.

00:11:13.427 --> 00:11:15.648
Everywhere else is younger.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.569
Now for the good news.

00:11:18.593 --> 00:11:19.902
Things are changing.

00:11:19.926 --> 00:11:22.601
The finance sector is coming to the party.

00:11:22.974 --> 00:11:26.212
After around 2,000 meetings
with finance leaders,

00:11:26.236 --> 00:11:28.776
primarily in the cafés
of Melbourne and Sydney

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.307
and London and Paris and New York
and all across the globe,

00:11:32.331 --> 00:11:36.302
momentum, moving away from investment
in the tobacco industry,

00:11:36.326 --> 00:11:38.071
is starting to snowball.

00:11:38.095 --> 00:11:41.286
Finance leaders are alarmed
when they're presented with the facts,

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:44.801
and overwhelmingly,
they want to be part of the solution.

00:11:45.357 --> 00:11:48.347
Here, in Australia, we now have

00:11:48.371 --> 00:11:55.022
10,636,101 superannuation accounts

00:11:55.046 --> 00:11:56.386
that are tobacco-free.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.138
That one is mine, by the way.

00:11:58.162 --> 00:12:05.077
(Applause)

00:12:05.101 --> 00:12:07.014
There is still a lot of work to be done,

00:12:07.038 --> 00:12:10.656
but I've watched the conversation go
from "Should we go tobacco-free?"

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.600
to "Why haven't we done it yet?"

00:12:13.174 --> 00:12:14.388
In the past year alone,

00:12:14.412 --> 00:12:18.666
major tobacco-free moves have been made
by leading financial organizations

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.785
in eight different countries.

00:12:20.809 --> 00:12:23.847
In Australia, New Zealand,
the Netherlands, Sweden,

00:12:23.871 --> 00:12:26.934
Denmark, France, Ireland and the USA.

00:12:26.958 --> 00:12:30.260
By sovereign wealth funds,
fund managers, pension funds,

00:12:30.284 --> 00:12:32.585
banks, insurers and reinsurers.

00:12:32.609 --> 00:12:34.744
Since tobacco-free portfolios began,

00:12:34.768 --> 00:12:38.146
more than six billion dollars
has been redirected

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.307
away from investment
in the tobacco industry.

00:12:41.331 --> 00:12:43.998
The case study is well and truly proven.

00:12:45.069 --> 00:12:48.172
When making the tobacco-free
announcement in March this year,

00:12:48.196 --> 00:12:51.069
the CEO of AMP Capital said,

00:12:51.093 --> 00:12:54.799
"We are not prepared to deliver
investment returns

00:12:54.823 --> 00:12:57.148
at any cost to society."

00:12:58.117 --> 00:13:00.656
And that is the question
we need to ask ourselves.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:05.712
Is there no baseline standard
below which we will not sink

00:13:05.736 --> 00:13:06.886
to make profit?

00:13:08.363 --> 00:13:11.331
Along the way, I've had a lot of help
and incredible support.

00:13:11.355 --> 00:13:13.188
Now, if you're trying to do something,

00:13:13.212 --> 00:13:16.101
I highly recommend that you have
a princess on your team.

00:13:16.871 --> 00:13:19.172
Her Royal Highness, Princess Dina Mired,

00:13:19.196 --> 00:13:22.037
is the global ambassador for this work.

00:13:22.061 --> 00:13:24.912
We also have a lord,
a knight, a former premier,

00:13:24.936 --> 00:13:27.941
a former federal minister
and a stack of CEOs.

00:13:28.373 --> 00:13:30.516
But the capacity to change things

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:34.512
does not rest exclusively
with these highly influential people.

00:13:34.992 --> 00:13:38.023
The power to do that is with all of us.

00:13:38.696 --> 00:13:41.339
Everyone here can be part of the solution.

00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:45.263
In fact, everyone here must be
part of the solution.

00:13:45.809 --> 00:13:49.856
Most people in this room own companies

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:54.147
via their superannuation funds,
their banks and their insurers.

00:13:54.483 --> 00:13:57.273
And it is time for us to ask them:

00:13:57.297 --> 00:14:01.549
Are they investing our money
in companies that make products

00:14:01.573 --> 00:14:04.318
that kill seven million people every year?

00:14:04.342 --> 00:14:05.612
It's your money.

00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:07.323
It's my money, it's our money.

00:14:07.347 --> 00:14:10.545
And that is a very reasonable question.

00:14:11.379 --> 00:14:12.974
Pretty cramped up here,

00:14:13.824 --> 00:14:16.382
with seven million people beside me today.

00:14:16.823 --> 00:14:20.092
But if we don't act now, and act together,

00:14:20.116 --> 00:14:23.496
we'll need to make way
for one billion people

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.587
before the end of this century.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.365
And this is a very big stage.

00:14:28.841 --> 00:14:30.801
But there is no more room.

00:14:30.825 --> 00:14:31.992
Thank you.

00:14:32.016 --> 00:14:36.888
(Applause)
