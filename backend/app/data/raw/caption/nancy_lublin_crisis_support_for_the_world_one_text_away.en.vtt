00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:15.032
"I'm 14, and I want to go home."

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:17.524
"My name is Beth, I'm here for you,

00:00:17.548 --> 00:00:18.698
tell me more."

00:00:19.532 --> 00:00:20.731
"I've run away before,

00:00:20.755 --> 00:00:23.283
but I've never been involved
with anything like this.

00:00:23.307 --> 00:00:25.418
I think they put drugs in my liquor."

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:27.768
"It sounds like you feel you're not safe.

00:00:27.792 --> 00:00:30.125
The fastest way for me to get help to you

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:32.640
is for you to call 911."

00:00:33.593 --> 00:00:34.744
"LOL, Beth.

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:36.379
If they hear me, they'll kill me.

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:39.105
They're about to send another man in
to have sex with me,

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:40.279
please hurry."

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.256
"OK, it sounds like you're in danger.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.097
I can call 911 for you and send help.

00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:47.788
You're being very brave."

00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:50.061
"Thanks, Beth.

00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:52.830
Tell the police to be careful,
these men are armed."

00:00:54.337 --> 00:00:55.894
I can share this story with you,

00:00:55.894 --> 00:01:00.446
because it was widely reported
in news outlets throughout the country.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.446
We did call 911.

00:01:03.137 --> 00:01:04.859
The police rescued this girl,

00:01:04.883 --> 00:01:06.041
two other girls,

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:08.434
and arrested three men,

00:01:08.458 --> 00:01:10.799
all at the Motel 6 in San Jose.

00:01:11.887 --> 00:01:14.037
My name is Nancy "Beth" Lublin.

00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:16.807
I'm the cofounder and CEO
of Crisis Text Line,

00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:19.141
the free 24/7 service

00:01:19.165 --> 00:01:21.641
that helps people by text and Messenger,

00:01:21.665 --> 00:01:24.299
with mental health
and behavioral health issues.

00:01:24.323 --> 00:01:26.792
And when I go on the platform
as a crisis counselor,

00:01:26.816 --> 00:01:28.315
I use the alias "Beth."

00:01:28.339 --> 00:01:31.513
I happen to be the crisis counselor
who took that conversation.

00:01:32.093 --> 00:01:33.871
But this is what Crisis Text Line is.

00:01:33.895 --> 00:01:37.324
It's strangers helping strangers
in their darkest moments

00:01:37.348 --> 00:01:40.061
to stay alive, feel less alone,

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:42.597
and to remind them how strong they are.

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:47.185
Crisis Text Line launched
quietly in August 2013

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:49.764
in Chicago and in El Paso,

00:01:49.788 --> 00:01:51.355
and within four months,

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:55.442
we were in all 274 area codes
of the United States,

00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:57.641
because people used the service,

00:01:57.665 --> 00:02:00.514
had a great experience
and shared it with their friends --

00:02:00.538 --> 00:02:02.299
that's organic growth.

00:02:02.323 --> 00:02:03.713
And in six and a half years,

00:02:03.737 --> 00:02:06.950
we've now processed
about 150 million messages.

00:02:07.497 --> 00:02:11.299
The people who use our free 24/7 service

00:02:11.323 --> 00:02:12.506
skew young,

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.347
because it's text, so they skew young.

00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:17.569
45 percent are under the age of 17.

00:02:17.593 --> 00:02:19.760
Also poor, racially diverse.

00:02:19.784 --> 00:02:22.474
17 percent identify as Hispanic,

00:02:22.498 --> 00:02:24.712
and 44 percent LGBTQ.

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:28.244
The top five issues
that we see are relationships,

00:02:28.268 --> 00:02:31.377
depression, anxiety, self-harm

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:33.877
and in approximately one
in four conversations,

00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:35.623
suicidal ideation.

00:02:36.282 --> 00:02:39.250
Everyone texting us is unhappy,

00:02:39.274 --> 00:02:43.880
yet we normally have
about an 86 percent satisfaction rating

00:02:43.904 --> 00:02:45.054
from our texters.

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:47.183
What makes it so good?

00:02:47.207 --> 00:02:50.008
The technology, the data and the people.

00:02:50.334 --> 00:02:51.823
So, the technology.

00:02:51.847 --> 00:02:53.529
It is not an app.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.156
It's not something you have to download.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.331
It's free,

00:02:57.355 --> 00:02:59.662
there's no complicated intake survey,

00:02:59.686 --> 00:03:01.521
so it's really user-friendly.

00:03:01.545 --> 00:03:02.942
You just text us.

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:05.204
We use machine learning
to stack-rank the queue

00:03:05.228 --> 00:03:06.378
based on severity.

00:03:06.696 --> 00:03:11.422
Kind of like a hospital emergency room
would take the gunshot wound

00:03:11.446 --> 00:03:13.371
before the kid with a sprained ankle.

00:03:13.395 --> 00:03:14.728
We work the same way.

00:03:14.752 --> 00:03:17.117
So we take the high-risk cases first.

00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:19.403
So the person who swallowed
a bottle of pills

00:03:19.427 --> 00:03:21.696
would come before someone else.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.053
This is data science to save lives.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.934
But it's humans who do the counseling.

00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:31.343
We've trained over 28,000
volunteer crisis counselors

00:03:31.367 --> 00:03:34.010
who apply online,
go through a background check

00:03:34.034 --> 00:03:36.177
and then about a 30-hour training.

00:03:36.201 --> 00:03:37.406
And if they pass --

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.689
not everybody passes,

00:03:38.713 --> 00:03:41.418
there's only a 33 percent pass rate --

00:03:41.442 --> 00:03:44.418
they can save lives from their couch.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.396
It's a new gig economy for volunteerism,

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.610
like Uber or Lyft for volunteerism.

00:03:50.634 --> 00:03:52.555
And we also have full-time staff

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.015
with a master's degree
in a relevant field.

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:56.450
They're supervisors,

00:03:56.474 --> 00:04:00.149
and they watch every conversation
and step in if needed.

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:02.109
Thanks to this technology and data

00:04:02.133 --> 00:04:04.291
and our volunteer labor model,

00:04:04.315 --> 00:04:07.045
we're able to reach
tons of people in pain.

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.562
People who don't have access
to other resources,

00:04:09.586 --> 00:04:13.862
like the gay teenager
who can't share with his parents,

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:16.550
because they keep telling him
to pray the gay away.

00:04:16.574 --> 00:04:19.139
Or the girl who can't sleep at 2am

00:04:19.163 --> 00:04:21.012
because she's got anxiety about finals

00:04:21.036 --> 00:04:24.137
and she doesn't want to disappoint
people who love her.

00:04:24.468 --> 00:04:25.627
So they text us.

00:04:25.651 --> 00:04:27.809
And we love on them.

00:04:27.833 --> 00:04:29.063
And we support them,

00:04:29.087 --> 00:04:31.444
and we remind them how strong they are.

00:04:31.468 --> 00:04:34.728
And we work on a plan
together to stay safe.

00:04:34.752 --> 00:04:37.260
And we tell them that if this felt good,

00:04:37.284 --> 00:04:38.434
sharing with us --

00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:41.895
and 68 percent of people say
they've shared something with us

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.474
they've never shared with another human,

00:04:44.498 --> 00:04:47.720
so if it feels good to share with us,

00:04:47.744 --> 00:04:51.790
maybe find just one other person
in your life tomorrow to share with.

00:04:51.814 --> 00:04:53.425
And after our conversation,

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.663
they put that safety plan in place.

00:04:56.687 --> 00:04:58.385
And maybe they go to sleep.

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:00.712
Or they journal.

00:05:00.736 --> 00:05:03.387
Or they listen to BTS or Lizzo,

00:05:03.411 --> 00:05:05.323
or they write a letter to their sister

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:08.394
or their boss or to themselves,
to read in 12 months.

00:05:09.323 --> 00:05:10.473
They stay safe.

00:05:11.466 --> 00:05:14.602
Sometimes, people have the ideation,

00:05:14.626 --> 00:05:16.657
the plan, the means and the timing

00:05:16.681 --> 00:05:18.704
to hurt themselves or someone else,

00:05:18.728 --> 00:05:20.401
and we can't deescalate.

00:05:20.763 --> 00:05:25.065
Like the man in Texas,
five years ago on Christmas Eve,

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:28.562
who told us he only felt pleasure
when he inflicted pain

00:05:28.586 --> 00:05:32.028
and he wanted to kill women
and was going to do it that very night.

00:05:32.052 --> 00:05:34.783
In those imminent risk situations,

00:05:34.807 --> 00:05:36.043
we call 911.

00:05:36.067 --> 00:05:37.750
And thank goodness for 911,

00:05:37.774 --> 00:05:39.536
because in that Texas incident,

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.068
as reported in the news,

00:05:41.092 --> 00:05:44.103
they did send help,
they sent the police to his home,

00:05:44.127 --> 00:05:47.413
and they found him with an arsenal
of loaded weapons

00:05:47.437 --> 00:05:51.399
and on record as being
in possession of a human foot.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.998
Now, active rescues
are less than one percent

00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:56.895
of our conversations.

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.887
But still, that's about 26 a day.

00:05:59.911 --> 00:06:04.682
And six of those a week are for homicide.

00:06:04.706 --> 00:06:06.506
Typically school shooters.

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.395
We have now completed
more than 32,000 active rescues.

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.649
Our own data and external studies

00:06:12.673 --> 00:06:15.188
show that we're very good at saving lives,

00:06:15.212 --> 00:06:16.855
and at changing lives.

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:21.894
We use the data to make it possible
for us to change systems.

00:06:22.196 --> 00:06:23.461
So for example,

00:06:23.485 --> 00:06:26.585
we've learned the best way,
the best language to risk-assess

00:06:26.609 --> 00:06:28.458
around suicidal ideation

00:06:28.482 --> 00:06:32.460
isn't to use the words,
"Are you thinking of committing suicide?"

00:06:32.484 --> 00:06:34.810
Instead, it's to use words like,

00:06:34.834 --> 00:06:36.849
"Are you thinking of death or dying?"

00:06:36.873 --> 00:06:39.524
Or "Are you thinking
about killing yourself?"

00:06:39.548 --> 00:06:43.691
And now, we've shared that language
with journalists, to adopt this.

00:06:43.715 --> 00:06:45.771
We've shared that language with activists.

00:06:45.795 --> 00:06:48.636
We're advising the National Emergency
Number Association,

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.557
the 911 Association,

00:06:50.581 --> 00:06:54.151
on best practices
for first responders in suicide.

00:06:54.175 --> 00:06:56.540
And we're working
with the Veterans Administration

00:06:56.564 --> 00:06:59.635
to identify suicidal ideation
and intent in veterans.

00:07:00.016 --> 00:07:02.358
(Sighs)

00:07:02.382 --> 00:07:04.482
Pain isn't an American experience.

00:07:04.506 --> 00:07:06.379
It's a human experience.

00:07:06.403 --> 00:07:08.807
So we've been growing.

00:07:08.831 --> 00:07:12.490
So far, we've been expanding
one country at a time:

00:07:12.514 --> 00:07:17.426
Ireland, the UK, Canada --
which we did in both French and English.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.109
And we could keep growing,
one country at a time.

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:22.185
And it would take us decades

00:07:22.209 --> 00:07:25.875
to reach even just a third
of the people in the world.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.018
And that's just not acceptable.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.633
We've already seen,
since the start of COVID in early March,

00:07:33.657 --> 00:07:36.410
a 40 percent increase in our volume.

00:07:36.434 --> 00:07:38.572
78 percent of our conversations

00:07:38.596 --> 00:07:42.672
include words like "freaked out,"
"scared," "panic."

00:07:42.696 --> 00:07:45.180
People are worried about the COVID virus,

00:07:45.204 --> 00:07:47.022
and so they're nervous about symptoms

00:07:47.046 --> 00:07:49.649
and they're concerned for family
on the front lines.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:53.402
We're also seeing the impact
of the quarantines themselves.

00:07:54.086 --> 00:07:56.634
People are away from their routines,

00:07:56.658 --> 00:07:59.863
perhaps they're quarantined
with abusive people.

00:07:59.887 --> 00:08:03.870
So we've seen a 48 percent
increase in sexual abuse,

00:08:03.894 --> 00:08:07.172
and a 74 percent increase
in domestic violence.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.488
One of the biggest impacts we've seen
of the virus and the lockdowns

00:08:12.512 --> 00:08:14.424
is the financial stress.

00:08:14.448 --> 00:08:17.670
We're seeing more people
reach out with fears of bankruptcy,

00:08:17.694 --> 00:08:20.536
fears of homelessness
and other financial ruin.

00:08:21.004 --> 00:08:22.170
And right now,

00:08:22.194 --> 00:08:24.577
32 percent of our texters

00:08:24.601 --> 00:08:29.871
identify as coming from household incomes
under 20,000 dollars.

00:08:29.895 --> 00:08:33.368
That's up from our typical
19 percent low income.

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:35.482
So we need to grow.

00:08:35.506 --> 00:08:36.656
Quickly.

00:08:37.022 --> 00:08:41.942
For months, we were planning on announcing
that we were going to expand by language:

00:08:41.966 --> 00:08:44.866
Five languages in the next five years,

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.090
covering 32 percent of the globe.

00:08:47.438 --> 00:08:49.104
And then, COVID happened.

00:08:49.462 --> 00:08:50.874
Things changed.

00:08:50.898 --> 00:08:53.498
And now five years feels like a luxury.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.511
So today, right now,

00:08:56.535 --> 00:08:59.503
we are committing
to do it in half the time.

00:08:59.527 --> 00:09:02.484
Five languages in two and a half years.

00:09:02.963 --> 00:09:04.980
We're going to turn on Spanish everywhere,

00:09:05.004 --> 00:09:07.085
English everywhere, Portuguese everywhere,

00:09:07.109 --> 00:09:08.363
French everywhere,

00:09:08.387 --> 00:09:09.831
and the fifth language?

00:09:09.855 --> 00:09:11.006
Arabic.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.307
So we're going to bring our service
to countries and populations

00:09:14.331 --> 00:09:16.633
that have limited mental health services

00:09:16.657 --> 00:09:18.954
and almost no data about what's going on.

00:09:18.978 --> 00:09:22.002
These include immigrant
populations -- who have phones.

00:09:22.026 --> 00:09:25.170
And young people, who are often
not counted in studies,

00:09:25.194 --> 00:09:26.914
but they have phones.

00:09:26.938 --> 00:09:28.682
So we're going to shift to language,

00:09:28.706 --> 00:09:30.914
which makes the technology easier,

00:09:30.938 --> 00:09:32.522
because in addition to text,

00:09:32.546 --> 00:09:34.879
we're going to be using
WhatsApp and Messenger.

00:09:34.903 --> 00:09:38.791
And global expansion helps us
with middle-of-the-night capacity,

00:09:38.815 --> 00:09:40.974
because we'll have time-zone coverage.

00:09:40.998 --> 00:09:42.172
So think about it,

00:09:42.196 --> 00:09:45.982
this will be strangers
helping strangers around the world.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.234
Like a giant global love machine.

00:09:50.369 --> 00:09:53.996
And the fact that the TED community
has supported our audacious dream

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.458
is just deeply, deeply meaningful,

00:09:57.482 --> 00:10:00.314
to me and to everybody on our team.

00:10:00.863 --> 00:10:03.363
And the best way
for us to show our gratitude

00:10:03.387 --> 00:10:07.016
is to just let you know
that we are ready and we are fired up.

00:10:07.508 --> 00:10:09.271
And we're going to use this support

00:10:09.295 --> 00:10:12.361
to impact millions of lives
around the world.

00:10:13.493 --> 00:10:14.961
Times are hard.

00:10:14.985 --> 00:10:17.899
And it's confusing, and it's depressing,

00:10:17.923 --> 00:10:22.327
and sometimes, we all feel alone,
especially in isolation.

00:10:22.796 --> 00:10:24.331
But no matter what age,

00:10:24.355 --> 00:10:26.926
no matter what your situation is
or where you live,

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.204
we'll be at your fingertips,
in your pocket.

00:10:32.522 --> 00:10:34.890
I've been thinking a lot
these last few weeks

00:10:34.914 --> 00:10:37.077
about that trafficked girl

00:10:37.101 --> 00:10:38.501
who I connected with.

00:10:38.895 --> 00:10:41.768
And I hope she's somewhere safe.

00:10:42.172 --> 00:10:43.394
I don't know ...

00:10:44.117 --> 00:10:46.545
I don't know how she's quarantined

00:10:46.569 --> 00:10:47.760
or who she's with,

00:10:47.784 --> 00:10:49.250
but I hope she's safe.

00:10:49.657 --> 00:10:52.625
And I don't know, last year,
how she had our number,

00:10:52.649 --> 00:10:56.033
or even how she had access
to a phone to reach out to us.

00:10:56.057 --> 00:10:57.366
I never asked her.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.898
Because it didn't matter.

00:10:58.922 --> 00:11:02.339
What mattered was
that she could contact us,

00:11:02.363 --> 00:11:05.180
that she did have it,
and we got help to her quickly.

00:11:05.204 --> 00:11:06.625
And that's the goal,

00:11:06.649 --> 00:11:09.545
it's to make it easier
for people to get help

00:11:09.569 --> 00:11:11.169
than avoid getting help.

00:11:12.021 --> 00:11:14.066
That in moments of hardship,

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.315
of danger, of physical distance,

00:11:17.339 --> 00:11:19.906
that nobody is ever alone.

00:11:20.262 --> 00:11:22.389
That thanks to Crisis Text Line,

00:11:22.413 --> 00:11:25.506
none of us is ever actually alone.

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.912
