00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:12.412
Billions of years ago 
on the young planet Earth

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:17.432
simple organic compounds assembled 
into more complex coalitions

00:00:17.432 --> 00:00:20.122
that could grow and reproduce.

00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:23.372
They were the very first life on Earth,

00:00:23.372 --> 00:00:27.512
and they gave rise to every one 
of the billions of species

00:00:27.512 --> 00:00:30.602
that have inhabited our planet since.

00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:33.712
At the time, Earth was almost completely 
devoid

00:00:33.712 --> 00:00:38.282
of what we’d recognize as a suitable 
environment for living things.

00:00:38.282 --> 00:00:41.725
The young planet had widespread 
volcanic activity

00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:45.335
and an atmosphere that created 
hostile conditions.

00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:48.835
So where on Earth could life begin?

00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:51.365
To begin the search for 
the cradle of life,

00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:56.715
it’s important to first understand the 
basic necessities for any life form.

00:00:56.715 --> 00:01:01.940
Elements and compounds essential to life
include hydrogen, methane, nitrogen,

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.468
carbon dioxide, phosphates, and ammonia.

00:01:05.468 --> 00:01:09.828
In order for these ingredients to comingle
and react with each other,

00:01:09.828 --> 00:01:13.260
they need a liquid solvent: water.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.700
And in order to grow and reproduce,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.260
all life needs a source of energy.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.300
Life forms are divided into two camps:

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.030
autotrophs, like plants, that generate 
their own energy,

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.330
and heterotrophs, like animals, that 
consume other organisms for energy.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.920
The first life form wouldn’t have had 
other organisms to consume, of course,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.391
so it must have been an autotroph,

00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:43.241
generating energy either from the sun
or from chemical gradients.

00:01:43.241 --> 00:01:46.641
So what locations meet these criteria?

00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:49.751
Places on land or close to the surface 
of the ocean

00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:52.591
have the advantage of access to sunlight.

00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:57.631
But at the time when life began,
the UV radiation on Earth’s surface

00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:01.221
was likely too harsh for life 
to survive there.

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:04.511
One setting offers protection 
from this radiation

00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:07.221
and an alternative energy source:

00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:11.321
the hydrothermal vents that wind across
the ocean floor,

00:02:11.321 --> 00:02:16.847
covered by kilometers of seawater 
and bathed in complete darkness.

00:02:16.847 --> 00:02:20.771
A hydrothermal vent is a fissure 
in the Earth’s crust

00:02:20.771 --> 00:02:23.891
where seawater seeps into magma 
chambers

00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:27.291
and is ejected back out 
at high temperatures,

00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:32.521
along with a rich slurry of minerals 
and simple chemical compounds.

00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:35.276
Energy is particularly concentrated

00:02:35.276 --> 00:02:39.566
at the steep chemical gradients 
of hydrothermal vents.

00:02:39.566 --> 00:02:42.882
There’s another line of evidence 
that points to hydrothermal vents:

00:02:42.882 --> 00:02:48.952
the Last Universal Common Ancestor 
of life, or LUCA for short.

00:02:48.952 --> 00:02:54.042
LUCA wasn’t the first life form, 
but it’s as far back as we can trace.

00:02:54.042 --> 00:02:57.959
Even so, we don’t actually know what 
LUCA looked like—

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.029
there’s no LUCA fossil, no modern-day 
LUCA still around—

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:07.159
instead, scientists identified genes that
are commonly found in species

00:03:07.161 --> 00:03:11.161
across all three domains 
of life that exist today.

00:03:11.161 --> 00:03:15.501
Since these genes are shared across 
species and domains,

00:03:15.501 --> 00:03:19.488
they must have been inherited from 
a common ancestor.

00:03:19.488 --> 00:03:25.298
These shared genes tell us that LUCA lived
in a hot, oxygen-free place

00:03:25.298 --> 00:03:28.488
and harvested energy from a chemical 
gradient—

00:03:28.488 --> 00:03:31.748
like the ones at hydrothermal vents.

00:03:31.748 --> 00:03:34.718
There are two kinds of hydrothermal vent:

00:03:34.718 --> 00:03:37.398
black smokers and white smokers.

00:03:37.398 --> 00:03:41.488
Black smokers release acidic, 
carbon-dioxide-rich water,

00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:47.268
heated to hundreds of degrees Celsius
and packed with sulphur, iron, copper,

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:50.136
and other metals essential to life.

00:03:50.136 --> 00:03:55.196
But scientists now believe that black 
smokers were too hot for LUCA—

00:03:55.196 --> 00:04:00.163
so now the top candidates for the 
cradle of life are white smokers.

00:04:00.163 --> 00:04:01.637
Among the white smokers,

00:04:01.637 --> 00:04:07.067
a field of hydrothermal vents on the 
Mid-Atlantic Ridge called Lost City

00:04:07.067 --> 00:04:11.157
has become the most favored candidate 
for the cradle of life.

00:04:11.157 --> 00:04:16.607
The seawater expelled here is highly 
alkaline and lacks carbon dioxide,

00:04:16.607 --> 00:04:21.101
but is rich in methane and offers 
more hospitable temperatures.

00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:25.770
Adjacent black smokers may have 
contributed the carbon dioxide necessary

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.122
for life to evolve at Lost City,

00:04:28.122 --> 00:04:31.652
giving it all the components to support 
the first organisms

00:04:31.652 --> 00:04:36.132
that radiated into the incredible 
diversity of life on Earth today.
