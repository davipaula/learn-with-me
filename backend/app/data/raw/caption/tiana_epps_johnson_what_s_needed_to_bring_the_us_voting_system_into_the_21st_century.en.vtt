00:00:13.504 --> 00:00:18.060
OK, I want to take a moment
to let each of you think to yourselves

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:22.118
about the last time
you sent or received a fax.

00:00:22.601 --> 00:00:23.602
(Laughter)

00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:25.746
Well, for me, it was this morning,

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.885
because one piece of my work

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:32.253
is making sure that everyone in the US
has the information that they need

00:00:32.277 --> 00:00:35.290
to make decisions
about the candidates on their ballot.

00:00:35.314 --> 00:00:36.826
And collecting that information

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.188
from the local government offices
responsible for maintaining it

00:00:40.212 --> 00:00:43.920
means sending and receiving
a lot of faxes.

00:00:45.147 --> 00:00:48.043
Voting is one of our most
fundamental rights.

00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:50.051
It's one of the most tangible ways

00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:53.097
that each and every one of us
can shape our communities.

00:00:53.506 --> 00:00:56.032
And as we enter this fourth
industrial revolution,

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:58.942
where technology is changing
everything around us,

00:00:58.966 --> 00:01:03.361
you would think, with something
as important as the right to vote,

00:01:03.385 --> 00:01:06.638
that we would have
the most modern, secure,

00:01:06.662 --> 00:01:09.681
inclusive system that could exist ...

00:01:09.705 --> 00:01:10.855
But we don't.

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:13.769
When we look at comparable democracies,

00:01:13.793 --> 00:01:17.144
the US has one of the lowest
voter turnout rates in the world.

00:01:17.831 --> 00:01:21.019
We have a system where even
the most persistent voters

00:01:21.043 --> 00:01:23.489
come up against exhausting barriers.

00:01:23.513 --> 00:01:26.117
A system where 20th-century technology --

00:01:26.141 --> 00:01:27.603
like fax machines --

00:01:27.627 --> 00:01:32.538
and outdated practices stand in the way
of full, vibrant participation.

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.926
In US presidential elections,
turnout hovers around 60 percent.

00:01:38.603 --> 00:01:40.815
The numbers are even lower
for local elections.

00:01:41.364 --> 00:01:44.421
That means that nearly 40 percent
of Americans aren't voters.

00:01:45.477 --> 00:01:48.662
That's nearly 100 million people.

00:01:50.763 --> 00:01:53.104
I believe in something
very straightforward:

00:01:54.141 --> 00:01:57.962
that everyone should have the information
that they need to become a voter,

00:01:57.986 --> 00:02:01.693
that the voting process
should be seamless and secure

00:02:01.717 --> 00:02:04.610
and that every voter
should have information they trust

00:02:04.634 --> 00:02:07.771
to make decisions
about the candidates on their ballot.

00:02:07.795 --> 00:02:09.971
Because when more people vote,

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:12.653
together, we make better decisions
for our communities.

00:02:13.786 --> 00:02:16.596
So I've spent the last
eight years on a mission

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.152
to push our democracy
into the 21st century.

00:02:20.147 --> 00:02:23.881
Now, one of the most common approaches
to election modernization

00:02:23.905 --> 00:02:26.276
is advocating for policy change,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.469
and that's an incredibly important
piece of the strategy

00:02:29.493 --> 00:02:32.640
for building a system where millions
of more people become voters.

00:02:33.778 --> 00:02:35.530
But I've taken a different approach.

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.635
I focused on a critical
yet largely untapped resource

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.120
for election modernization:

00:02:42.248 --> 00:02:43.832
local election officials.

00:02:44.436 --> 00:02:48.921
I work with thousands of local
election officials across the country

00:02:48.945 --> 00:02:52.753
to build tools and skills
that they can use immediately

00:02:52.777 --> 00:02:55.558
to transform the way
that they're engaging today's voters.

00:02:56.452 --> 00:02:57.959
Folks like Kat and Marie.

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:02.416
Kat and Marie have worked together
for years in a windowless office

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.516
in the basement of the Mercer County
Courthouse in West Virginia.

00:03:06.021 --> 00:03:08.484
Together, they have
a tremendous responsibility.

00:03:09.193 --> 00:03:14.064
They're local election officials serving
Mercer County's 40,000 registered voters.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.567
Local election officials
are the public servants

00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:20.842
that do the day-to-day work
that makes our election system function.

00:03:21.493 --> 00:03:23.581
When you fill out
a voter-registration form,

00:03:23.605 --> 00:03:26.555
they're the folks that process them
and add you to the rolls.

00:03:27.552 --> 00:03:31.559
They're the folks who buy the technology
that we use to cast and count ballots.

00:03:31.997 --> 00:03:35.394
They recruit and train the volunteers
at your local polling place.

00:03:35.418 --> 00:03:38.029
And they're the official
nonpartisan source

00:03:38.053 --> 00:03:40.904
for informing people
in their communities about how to vote.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.902
And unlike other countries

00:03:43.926 --> 00:03:46.871
where there's some form
of centralized election authority,

00:03:46.895 --> 00:03:48.246
in the US,

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:54.226
there are 7,897 different county
and municipal offices,

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.660
like Kat and Marie's,

00:03:55.684 --> 00:03:59.303
that each have an independent role
in administering elections.

00:03:59.327 --> 00:04:02.675
Yes, that's nearly 8,000
slightly different ways

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:05.870
that you might experience voting
based on where you happen to live.

00:04:07.295 --> 00:04:09.565
When I was talking with Kat and Marie,

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:13.228
like so many election officials
that I talk with in rural towns

00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:15.147
and in major cities alike,

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:19.115
they were deeply proud of getting
to help people in their communities,

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.744
but they were also worried.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.498
All of the new tools that people
were using to get information --

00:04:24.522 --> 00:04:26.615
the internet, social media --

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.530
they were difficult to figure out
how to use effectively.

00:04:29.554 --> 00:04:33.393
And they felt like they weren't fully
meeting the needs of Mercer County voters.

00:04:34.254 --> 00:04:37.360
One thing that they really wished
that they had was a website

00:04:37.384 --> 00:04:38.624
so they could create a hub

00:04:38.648 --> 00:04:41.719
with information about
how to register in upcoming elections,

00:04:41.743 --> 00:04:43.610
and a place to put election results.

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:47.257
See, at the time,
when voters had questions,

00:04:47.281 --> 00:04:50.357
they had to either call
or visit their office,

00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:53.002
which meant that Kat and Marie
were inevitably answering

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:55.841
the same questions over and over again,

00:04:55.865 --> 00:04:59.137
which is both a superinefficient
use of their time,

00:04:59.161 --> 00:05:02.137
but also created totally unnecessary
barriers for voters

00:05:02.161 --> 00:05:04.930
when that information
could just live online.

00:05:06.295 --> 00:05:08.184
And Mercer County wasn't alone.

00:05:08.753 --> 00:05:13.106
At the time, they were one
of 966 counties in the US

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.081
that had no voting information online.

00:05:16.366 --> 00:05:17.516
I'll let that sink in.

00:05:19.233 --> 00:05:22.535
They were one of the nearly one-third
of counties in the US

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:23.948
that had no place online

00:05:23.972 --> 00:05:26.612
to find official information
about how to vote.

00:05:28.273 --> 00:05:32.015
To Kat and Marie, not having
and election website was unacceptable,

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:33.956
but they didn't have very many options.

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.014
They didn't have the budget
to hire a web developer,

00:05:37.038 --> 00:05:39.839
they didn't have the expertise
to build a site themselves,

00:05:39.863 --> 00:05:41.135
so they went without.

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:45.047
And 40,000 voters
in Mercer County went without.

00:05:46.765 --> 00:05:50.091
We're in a moment where we have
an unprecedented opportunity

00:05:50.115 --> 00:05:52.222
to transform civic engagement.

00:05:53.476 --> 00:05:56.231
Technology is revolutionizing
science and industry.

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:59.057
It's already transformed
how we connect with one another

00:05:59.081 --> 00:06:01.564
and understand the world around us,

00:06:01.588 --> 00:06:04.238
but our democratic institutions --

00:06:04.262 --> 00:06:05.979
they're being left behind.

00:06:07.198 --> 00:06:10.111
The US is one of the few
major democracies in the world

00:06:10.135 --> 00:06:14.283
that puts the onus of voter registration
on the individual voter,

00:06:14.307 --> 00:06:15.607
rather than the government.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.669
The rules that govern how to vote
vary from state to state,

00:06:19.693 --> 00:06:21.631
and sometimes even county to county.

00:06:22.151 --> 00:06:25.039
And we have ballots
that are pages and pages long.

00:06:25.614 --> 00:06:28.106
This November, on my ballot,

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.682
there are literally over
100 different people and referenda

00:06:31.706 --> 00:06:34.241
for me to make decisions about.

00:06:34.265 --> 00:06:36.866
We have to be using
the best tools we can bring to bear

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.117
to help voters navigate this complexity,

00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:41.077
and right now, we're not.

00:06:42.754 --> 00:06:45.893
One of the most common narratives
I hear in my work

00:06:45.917 --> 00:06:49.490
is that people aren't civically engaged
because they're apathetic --

00:06:49.514 --> 00:06:50.976
because they don't care.

00:06:52.322 --> 00:06:55.411
But as my brilliant friends
at the Center for Civic Design say,

00:06:55.435 --> 00:06:57.092
if there is apathy,

00:06:57.116 --> 00:06:59.145
it comes from the system,

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:00.388
not the voter.

00:07:01.338 --> 00:07:04.960
We can change the system right now

00:07:04.984 --> 00:07:08.506
by connecting local election officials
like Kat and Marie

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.700
with 21st-century tools

00:07:10.724 --> 00:07:15.169
and the training that they need
to use them to better serve voters.

00:07:16.359 --> 00:07:21.316
Tools and training to do things like
use social media for voter engagement,

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.855
or use data to staff
and equip polling places

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:27.301
so that we don't see
hours-long lines at the polls,

00:07:27.325 --> 00:07:29.939
or training on cybersecurity
best practices

00:07:29.963 --> 00:07:33.196
so that we can ensure
that our voting systems are secure.

00:07:34.373 --> 00:07:35.897
When we invest in this approach,

00:07:35.921 --> 00:07:39.170
we see meaningful, lasting results.

00:07:40.403 --> 00:07:41.985
Kat and Marie are online now.

00:07:42.883 --> 00:07:45.581
Inspired by their experience,
we built a website template

00:07:45.605 --> 00:07:49.017
using research-based
best practices in civic design,

00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:50.623
and developed the training

00:07:50.647 --> 00:07:54.471
so that Kat and Marie are able
to maintain their site themselves.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.451
In less than a week,

00:07:56.475 --> 00:08:00.005
they went from having never seen
the back end of a website

00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:02.416
to building a resource
for Mercer County voters

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.238
that they have been independently
keeping up to date since 2014.

00:08:07.359 --> 00:08:10.334
Today, the 40,000 voters in Mercer County

00:08:10.358 --> 00:08:14.086
and over 100,000 voters
in counties across the country

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.460
have everything that they need
to become a voter

00:08:16.484 --> 00:08:18.752
directly from their local
election official,

00:08:18.776 --> 00:08:23.014
on a mobile-friendly,
easy-to-use, accessible website.

00:08:24.782 --> 00:08:28.313
And we can even further scale the impact

00:08:28.337 --> 00:08:30.916
when local election officials
are not only reaching out

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.239
through their own channels,

00:08:32.263 --> 00:08:35.675
but they're extending their reach
by working in partnership with others.

00:08:36.773 --> 00:08:38.854
Efforts like the Ballot
Information Project

00:08:38.878 --> 00:08:43.209
and the Voting Information Project
work with election officials nationwide

00:08:43.233 --> 00:08:47.342
to create a centralized, standard database
of key voting information,

00:08:47.366 --> 00:08:49.750
like what's on your ballot
and where to vote.

00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:55.237
That information powers tools built
by companies like Google and Facebook

00:08:55.261 --> 00:08:58.103
to get information in the places
where people already are,

00:08:58.127 --> 00:09:00.517
like their newsfeed and search.

00:09:02.023 --> 00:09:05.733
In 2016, the Ballot Information Project

00:09:05.757 --> 00:09:09.528
connected the public with information
about candidates and referenda

00:09:09.552 --> 00:09:13.218
over 200 millions times,

00:09:13.242 --> 00:09:18.087
helping between a third and a half
of every single person who cast a ballot.

00:09:19.666 --> 00:09:22.873
And that model has been replicated
for elections around the world.

00:09:24.284 --> 00:09:27.955
When we look at efforts
in other areas of government,

00:09:27.979 --> 00:09:32.075
we can see the opportunity
when we listen to the public's needs

00:09:32.099 --> 00:09:33.949
and we meet them with modern tools.

00:09:34.504 --> 00:09:36.401
I think about my friends at mRelief,

00:09:36.425 --> 00:09:39.965
who have helped 260,000 families

00:09:39.989 --> 00:09:43.979
unlock 42 million dollars in food benefits

00:09:44.003 --> 00:09:46.275
by helping government agencies
transition away

00:09:46.299 --> 00:09:50.911
from a 20-page, paper-based
application for food stamps

00:09:50.935 --> 00:09:56.008
to a process that can happen
in 10 questions over text message

00:09:56.032 --> 00:09:57.859
in fewer than three minutes.

00:09:58.538 --> 00:10:01.678
That kind of transformation
is possible in voting.

00:10:02.537 --> 00:10:04.999
It's happening right now,

00:10:05.023 --> 00:10:06.879
but there's still so much work to do.

00:10:08.402 --> 00:10:12.901
Now, if you have any technical
bone in your body,

00:10:12.925 --> 00:10:14.728
I know what you're thinking.

00:10:14.752 --> 00:10:16.077
This is all solvable.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.981
The technology that we need exists.

00:10:19.486 --> 00:10:21.627
We collectively have the expertise.

00:10:22.503 --> 00:10:24.600
You might even be thinking
about volunteering

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.138
at your local election office.

00:10:26.514 --> 00:10:29.230
I love how solutions-oriented you are,

00:10:29.254 --> 00:10:31.128
but to be clear,

00:10:31.152 --> 00:10:34.582
the work that is needed
to modernize our election system

00:10:34.606 --> 00:10:38.136
isn't something that's going to happen
using 20 percent time,

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.659
or through a hackathon,

00:10:39.683 --> 00:10:42.279
or by doing a one-off technology project.

00:10:42.796 --> 00:10:48.456
What we need is significant,
sustained, long-term investment.

00:10:49.042 --> 00:10:51.027
Investment in technology

00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:53.896
and investment in the skills
of local election officials

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.369
to run 21st-century elections,

00:10:57.393 --> 00:11:00.001
because if we don't
invest in the long game,

00:11:00.025 --> 00:11:02.419
we risk finding ourselves
perpetually behind.

00:11:03.624 --> 00:11:07.072
So if you're ready to help millions,

00:11:07.096 --> 00:11:10.335
if you're ready to close the gap
between the system that we have

00:11:10.359 --> 00:11:12.833
and the system that we deserve,

00:11:12.857 --> 00:11:14.007
we need you.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.712
Organizations that are doing
this work year-round need you.

00:11:18.741 --> 00:11:20.781
Local election offices need you.

00:11:21.873 --> 00:11:23.023
Come join us.

00:11:23.873 --> 00:11:25.024
Thank you.

00:11:25.048 --> 00:11:28.785
(Applause)
