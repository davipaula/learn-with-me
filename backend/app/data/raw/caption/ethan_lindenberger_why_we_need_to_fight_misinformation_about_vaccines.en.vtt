00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:16.018
To start, I want to share with you guys
something about my hometown

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:17.309
of Norwalk, Ohio.

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.476
Now, as this video stated,
I am from Norwalk,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.643
which is an extremely small town,
about 15,000 people.

00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:25.309
And really, in Norwalk,
if you want to do something fun,

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.636
you go to Walmart or drive half an hour
to something more interesting.

00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:31.601
And for Norwalk, I've lived there
for my entire life,

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:34.434
I'm a senior at the local
public high school,

00:00:34.458 --> 00:00:37.851
and you know, it's something
to where I really enjoy my small town.

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:39.851
And I'm just a normal kid, you know,

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:42.268
I lead debate clubs,
I volunteer at my church.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:45.476
And back in November of 2018,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.601
I made a small Reddit post
asking for advice

00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:52.518
on an issue that I was encountering
that I needed some clarification on.

00:00:52.542 --> 00:00:54.893
And this issue, as was stated
in the introduction,

00:00:54.917 --> 00:00:56.684
was something towards vaccinations

00:00:56.708 --> 00:00:59.393
and how I was not immunized
against various diseases,

00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:03.893
including polio and measles,
as well as influenza, HPV, hepatitis --

00:01:03.917 --> 00:01:06.893
the standard vaccine
someone my age would receive.

00:01:06.917 --> 00:01:10.476
Now, this question I asked
was simple and pretty strange,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.643
because, you know,
I wanted to get vaccinated.

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:14.559
That's kind of weird, but it happened,

00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:16.768
and then this turned into a public story,

00:01:16.792 --> 00:01:18.934
because I wanted to get vaccinated.

00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:21.518
So that was kind of strange,
and then it blew up more,

00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:24.066
and I was doing interviews
and talking to more people,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.393
and again, I'm a normal kid,
I'm not a scientist,

00:01:26.417 --> 00:01:29.643
I don't lead a non-profit,
I am a pretty casual person,

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:31.059
I'm wearing a hoodie.

00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:33.143
(Laughter)

00:01:33.167 --> 00:01:36.309
Because of this question and this story,

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.976
because I wanted to get vaccinated

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.934
and this interesting situation I was in,

00:01:39.958 --> 00:01:42.149
I saw that I quickly was
in this public setting

00:01:42.173 --> 00:01:46.059
of an extremely important controversy
and discussion taking place.

00:01:46.083 --> 00:01:50.143
Now, I saw that the stories and headlines
were pretty accurate for most part,

00:01:50.167 --> 00:01:52.434
you know, "After defying anti-vax mom,

00:01:52.458 --> 00:01:54.768
Ohio teen expresses
why he got vaccinated."

00:01:54.792 --> 00:01:56.559
Pretty accurate, pretty true.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:59.393
And, as stated, I testified
in front of a Senate committee,

00:01:59.417 --> 00:02:00.851
so there, they said,

00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:02.309
"This teen who self-vaccinated

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:05.393
just ripped his mom's anti-vaxer beliefs
in front of Congress."

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:08.726
OK, I didn't really do that,
but that's fine.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.143
And certain news outlets
took it a little further.

00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:14.934
"'God knows how I'm still alive':

00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:19.976
Teenager, 18, finally gets vaccinated
and attacks his anti-vax parents."

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.476
So I did not attack my parents,
that's not accurate at all.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.018
And you know, really,
my story was more about controversy.

00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:30.143
It was about how my mom
was bad and I was good,

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:32.018
and I was ripping her a new one.

00:02:32.042 --> 00:02:33.309
Not true.

00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:34.601
Not what was happening.

00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:36.351
I never was rude towards my mother,

00:02:36.375 --> 00:02:38.559
and even in public settings
where I expressed

00:02:38.583 --> 00:02:40.184
how her beliefs were misinformed,

00:02:40.208 --> 00:02:44.018
I said that she was a loving mother,
and that's important to understand.

00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:46.934
Because a lot of people, I think,
in the scientific community

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:49.143
that understand
why vaccines are so important,

00:02:49.167 --> 00:02:51.893
can really be confused
by someone who would not vaccinate.

00:02:51.917 --> 00:02:55.226
Really, we can compare it to someone
not taking their child to the ER.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.250
That's a very dangerous situation to be in

00:02:57.274 --> 00:03:00.655
and it shows some lack of empathy
towards your children in some regards.

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:02.893
And really, I can understand that, I can.

00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:07.101
But my mom, she was misinformed
and misled by sources that convinced her

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:10.893
that if she was a loving parent,
she wouldn't vaccinate.

00:03:10.917 --> 00:03:13.809
Now, when I encountered this
and I talked to my mom,

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:15.643
it didn't obviously go well at first,

00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:17.456
because I was wanting to do something

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.156
that she thought would either cause autism
or maim me for the rest of my life,

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.606
and I said I wanted to do this --
didn't really fly,

00:03:23.626 --> 00:03:24.768
didn't really go well.

00:03:24.792 --> 00:03:26.643
But the thing that I found interesting

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:29.476
was that when I had started
to get into this circumstance,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.768
do these interviews,

00:03:30.792 --> 00:03:32.434
there was one question I proposed.

00:03:32.458 --> 00:03:33.726
Wasn't a positive one:

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.851
What in the world
have I gotten myself into?

00:03:35.875 --> 00:03:37.393
That's what I asked constantly,

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:39.976
because, again, I am not an expert,
I am a normal kid,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.309
and now I'm talking to CNN and Fox News
about a scientific discussion

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:47.559
that really, should I be facilitating,
should I be commenting on?

00:03:47.583 --> 00:03:50.643
And a lot of people questioned that,
and for good reason.

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:52.858
But I never claimed things
I didn't understand,

00:03:52.882 --> 00:03:54.768
I talked about my personal experiences.

00:03:54.792 --> 00:03:56.269
And even at the Senate hearing,

00:03:56.293 --> 00:03:58.768
I just talked about
how misinformation is dangerous.

00:03:58.792 --> 00:04:01.851
My mom got a lot of her beliefs
from social media, from Facebook

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:05.184
and from organizations that were allowing
their platforms to push lies

00:04:05.208 --> 00:04:06.476
that were very dangerous.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.893
Now, I also saw that
as I was doing this --

00:04:08.917 --> 00:04:11.184
and I was doing this
as respectfully as I could,

00:04:11.208 --> 00:04:12.559
as accurately as I could --

00:04:12.583 --> 00:04:15.441
I was getting a lot of criticism,
a lot of very angry people.

00:04:15.465 --> 00:04:17.726
When I was in DC
for that testimony I gave,

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.809
I was looking around the office building

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:21.893
and three ladies
got in an elevator with me

00:04:21.917 --> 00:04:25.143
and said I'm the reason their children
are being maimed and murdered

00:04:25.167 --> 00:04:26.518
and I'm basically Hitler.

00:04:26.542 --> 00:04:27.851
So that was fun.

00:04:27.875 --> 00:04:29.726
(Laughter)

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.434
So really, for most circumstances,
for most teenagers and most people,

00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:36.559
when they get criticized,
it leads to doubt.

00:04:36.583 --> 00:04:40.184
And that doubt leads to questioning,
and that questioning leads to quitting.

00:04:40.208 --> 00:04:43.601
Because, when you have a topic
that you're interested in,

00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:46.101
or a movement that you want
to be a part of,

00:04:46.125 --> 00:04:48.476
and you're taking a stance
and saying what's true,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.226
good ideas don't avoid criticism.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.684
And for especially young people,
they have a hard time dealing with that,

00:04:53.708 --> 00:04:57.184
and these important discussions
that need young people to take a part in,

00:04:57.208 --> 00:04:58.643
it takes a lot of commitment.

00:04:58.667 --> 00:05:01.684
I'm not saying that I'm amazing,
but here's what's important:

00:05:01.708 --> 00:05:05.226
through me joining this movement
and this important scientific discussion,

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.559
here's what happened.

00:05:06.583 --> 00:05:08.143
Facebook changed their platform.

00:05:08.167 --> 00:05:11.101
They were going to change
how they approach anti-vax content.

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:14.184
Amazon even removed misinformed
books about autism and vaccines.

00:05:14.208 --> 00:05:16.768
And recently, GoFundMe took down
anti-vax campaigns.

00:05:16.792 --> 00:05:20.101
We're talking about how movements
like this are causing actual change,

00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:22.351
actually impacting the way
this game is played

00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:24.518
and the misinformation
that's lying to people

00:05:24.542 --> 00:05:26.934
and convincing them
of very dangerous ideas.

00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:30.018
Now, before I leave, because I only have
a short amount of time,

00:05:30.042 --> 00:05:32.684
I want to give you one
important thing to keep in mind.

00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:34.518
One important takeaway from this all.

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:36.893
What you can do and what I did.

00:05:36.917 --> 00:05:40.143
I didn't do amazing research and studies

00:05:40.167 --> 00:05:42.351
and take information
and present it to people;

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:45.768
I didn't have deep, intellectual,
scientific debates with people.

00:05:45.792 --> 00:05:47.643
All I did was share my story.

00:05:47.667 --> 00:05:49.309
And that's enough for most people:

00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:54.143
to understand the anecdotal experiences,
the real people behind the data.

00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:56.184
Because data doesn't resonate with people.

00:05:56.208 --> 00:05:57.601
People resonate with people.

00:05:57.625 --> 00:05:59.268
And you have to keep that in mind,

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:01.393
because when you are talking
about a topic,

00:06:01.417 --> 00:06:04.309
and you're sharing your story,
and sharing what is important,

00:06:04.333 --> 00:06:05.601
you stay authentic.

00:06:05.625 --> 00:06:07.851
Stay authentic to the data,
to the information,

00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:09.559
to the importance of this topic.

00:06:09.583 --> 00:06:11.184
If I was talking to an individual

00:06:11.208 --> 00:06:13.268
and they said,
"Why are vaccines important?"

00:06:13.292 --> 00:06:15.559
I would say nothing alongside
any other answer,

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:19.268
I would not in any way fathomably
give them answer outside of:

00:06:19.292 --> 00:06:21.809
people are dying, and that's important.

00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:24.309
And that children are dying,
and that's important.

00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:27.351
And that we're having disease outbreaks
that should not be here.

00:06:27.375 --> 00:06:29.143
And I believe, as John Boyle put it,

00:06:29.167 --> 00:06:32.406
these diseases should be in history books
and not in our communities.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.156
So because of that, you need to make
a personal decision to stand up for truth.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.559
You need to make
a personal decision for yourself

00:06:38.583 --> 00:06:41.643
to say, "This is accurate,
this is what's real,

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:43.101
and these lies are not OK."

00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:45.851
Because it started with me
doing that on a personal level.

00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:48.268
I wasn't going from small town
to Senate in a day.

00:06:48.292 --> 00:06:50.143
It wasn't like, I go to bed, I wake up

00:06:50.167 --> 00:06:53.226
and there's Senator Isakson,
asking me questions about vaccines.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.893
It was a slow progression
and it started with me saying,

00:06:55.917 --> 00:06:57.226
"This is true,

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.309
my mom doesn't believe it, but that's OK."

00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:01.184
Because that doesn't change the truth,

00:07:01.208 --> 00:07:03.809
doesn't change what's accurate
and what's important.

00:07:03.833 --> 00:07:06.226
And honestly, the biggest thing,

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.518
this whole idea of unbreakable:
remain unbroken.

00:07:09.542 --> 00:07:12.476
When you stand up for what's true
and you have that criticism,

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.559
and you're trying to cause
a movement, don't sway.

00:07:15.583 --> 00:07:16.851
Thank you.

00:07:16.875 --> 00:07:20.250
(Applause)
