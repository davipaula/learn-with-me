00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:16.212
We need to build
a weather service for water.

00:00:16.236 --> 00:00:19.610
Yet, until we collectively
demand accountability,

00:00:19.634 --> 00:00:22.470
the incentives to fund it will not exist.

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:28.744
The first time I spoke at a conference
was here at TED, eight years ago.

00:00:28.768 --> 00:00:31.056
Fresh out of grad school,
little did I know

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.934
that in those few minutes onstage,

00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:35.492
I was framing the questions
I was going to be asked

00:00:35.516 --> 00:00:36.791
for the next decade.

00:00:37.599 --> 00:00:40.111
And, like too many 20-somethings,

00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:42.611
I expected to solve
the world's problems --

00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:45.387
more specifically,
the world's water problems --

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:47.118
with my technology.

00:00:48.044 --> 00:00:49.458
I had a lot to learn.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.114
It was seductive,

00:00:52.138 --> 00:00:56.470
believing that our biggest
water quality problems persist

00:00:56.494 --> 00:00:58.947
because they're so hard to identify.

00:00:59.532 --> 00:01:01.199
And I presumed

00:01:01.223 --> 00:01:06.303
that we just needed simpler, faster
and more affordable sensors.

00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:08.375
I was wrong.

00:01:09.512 --> 00:01:13.635
While it's true that
managing tomorrow's water risk

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.729
is going to require better data
and more technology,

00:01:17.753 --> 00:01:22.294
today we're barely using
the little water data that we have.

00:01:22.814 --> 00:01:27.501
Our biggest water problems persist
because of what we don't do

00:01:27.525 --> 00:01:30.502
and the problems we fail to acknowledge.

00:01:31.151 --> 00:01:32.764
There's actually little question

00:01:32.788 --> 00:01:37.635
about what today's water data
is telling us to do as a species:

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.443
we need to conserve more,

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:41.154
and we need to pollute less.

00:01:42.364 --> 00:01:46.688
But today's data is not going to help us
forecast the emerging risks

00:01:46.712 --> 00:01:48.924
facing businesses and markets.

00:01:48.948 --> 00:01:52.015
It's rapidly becoming useless for that.

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.997
It used to carry more value,

00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:58.016
but it's never actually told us
with any real accuracy

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.582
how much water we have

00:01:59.606 --> 00:02:00.796
or what's in it.

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.282
Let's consider the past decade
of water usage statistics

00:02:06.306 --> 00:02:08.532
from each of the G20 nations.

00:02:08.556 --> 00:02:11.109
Now, what these numbers do not tell you

00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:16.197
is that none of these countries
directly measures how much water they use.

00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:17.505
These are all estimates,

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.152
and they're based on outdated models

00:02:20.176 --> 00:02:23.010
that don't consider the climate crisis,

00:02:23.034 --> 00:02:26.468
nor do they consider its impact on water.

00:02:28.037 --> 00:02:32.079
In 2015, Chennai,
India's sixth-largest city,

00:02:32.103 --> 00:02:35.485
was hit with the worst floods
it had seen in a century.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.362
Today, its water reservoirs
are nearly dry.

00:02:40.862 --> 00:02:43.864
It took three years to get here,

00:02:43.888 --> 00:02:46.207
three years of subaverage rainfall.

00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:50.941
Now, that's faster than most nations
tabulate their national water data,

00:02:50.965 --> 00:02:52.488
including the US.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.808
And although there were forecasts

00:02:55.832 --> 00:03:00.064
that predicted severe shortages
of water in Chennai,

00:03:00.088 --> 00:03:03.596
none of them could actually help us
pinpoint exactly when or where

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.118
this was going to happen.

00:03:05.536 --> 00:03:08.577
This is a new type of water problem,

00:03:08.601 --> 00:03:13.915
because the rate at which
every aspect of our water cycle changes

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:15.368
is accelerating.

00:03:15.392 --> 00:03:18.717
As a recent UN warning
this month revealed,

00:03:18.741 --> 00:03:24.006
we are now facing one new
climate emergency every single week.

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:29.320
There are greater uncertainties
ahead for water quality.

00:03:29.344 --> 00:03:33.141
It's rare in most countries
for most water bodies to be tested

00:03:33.165 --> 00:03:36.016
for more than a handful
of contaminants in a year.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.201
Instead of testing, we use
what's called the "dilution model"

00:03:39.225 --> 00:03:40.987
to manage pollution.

00:03:41.011 --> 00:03:44.679
Now, imagine I took
an Olympic-sized swimming pool,

00:03:44.703 --> 00:03:48.036
I filled it with fresh water
and I added one drop of mercury.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.882
That would dilute down
to one part per billion mercury,

00:03:50.906 --> 00:03:53.479
which is well within what
the World Health Organization

00:03:53.503 --> 00:03:55.037
considers safe.

00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:59.279
But if there was any unforeseen drop
in how much water was available --

00:03:59.303 --> 00:04:04.220
less groundwater, less stream flow,
less water in the pool --

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:06.201
less dilution would take place,

00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:08.428
and things would get more toxic.

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.414
So this is how most countries
are managing pollution.

00:04:12.438 --> 00:04:15.757
They use this model to tell them
how much pollution is safe.

00:04:16.146 --> 00:04:18.271
And it has clear weaknesses,

00:04:18.295 --> 00:04:20.937
but it worked well enough
when we had abundant water

00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:23.318
and consistent weather patterns.

00:04:23.751 --> 00:04:27.787
Now that we don't, we're going to need
to invest and develop

00:04:27.811 --> 00:04:30.137
new data-collection strategies.

00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:34.236
But before we do that, we have to start
acting on the data we already have.

00:04:34.944 --> 00:04:37.066
This is a jet fuel fire.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.926
As many of you may be aware,

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.283
jet fuel emissions play
an enormous role in climate change.

00:04:42.307 --> 00:04:45.941
What you might not be aware of
is that the US Department of Defense

00:04:45.965 --> 00:04:48.748
is the world's largest
consumer of jet fuel.

00:04:48.772 --> 00:04:50.502
And when they consume jet fuel,

00:04:50.526 --> 00:04:54.552
they mandate the use
of the firefighting foam pictured here,

00:04:54.576 --> 00:04:57.803
which contains a class
of chemicals called PFAS.

00:04:57.827 --> 00:05:01.634
Nobody uses more of this foam
than the US Department of Defense,

00:05:01.658 --> 00:05:06.102
and every time it's used, PFAS
finds its way into our water systems.

00:05:06.582 --> 00:05:11.487
Globally, militaries have been using
this foam since the 1970s.

00:05:11.511 --> 00:05:15.057
We know PFAS causes cancer, birth defects,

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:17.928
and it's now so pervasive
in the environment

00:05:17.952 --> 00:05:22.238
that we seem to find it in nearly
every living thing we test,

00:05:22.262 --> 00:05:23.724
including us.

00:05:25.073 --> 00:05:29.235
But so far, the US Department of Defense
has not been held accountable

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:31.021
for PFAS contamination,

00:05:31.045 --> 00:05:32.945
nor has it been held liable.

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:36.932
And although there's an effort underway
to phase out these firefighting foams,

00:05:36.956 --> 00:05:40.469
they're not embracing safer,
effective alternatives.

00:05:40.493 --> 00:05:43.330
They're actually using
other PFAS molecules,

00:05:43.354 --> 00:05:48.565
which may, for all we know,
carry worse health consequences.

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:56.520
So today, government accountability
is eroding to the point of elimination,

00:05:56.544 --> 00:06:01.343
and the risk of liability
from water pollution is vanishing.

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:06.370
What types of incentives does this create
for investing in our water future?

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:12.916
Over the past decade, the average
early stage global investment

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.367
in early stage water technology companies

00:06:15.391 --> 00:06:18.173
has totaled less than
30 million dollars every year.

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:25.257
That's 0.12 percent of global
venture capital for early stage companies.

00:06:27.035 --> 00:06:31.605
And public spending is not going up
nearly fast enough.

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:35.693
And a closer look at it reveals
that water is not a priority.

00:06:36.371 --> 00:06:41.779
In 2014, the US federal government
was spending 11 dollars per citizen

00:06:41.803 --> 00:06:43.693
on water infrastructure,

00:06:43.717 --> 00:06:47.871
versus 251 dollars on IT infrastructure.

00:06:48.478 --> 00:06:51.795
So when we don't use the data we have,

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:54.458
we don't encourage investment
in new technologies,

00:06:54.482 --> 00:06:56.642
we don't encourage more data collection

00:06:56.666 --> 00:07:01.677
and we certainly don't encourage
investment in securing a water future.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.446
So are we doomed?

00:07:05.477 --> 00:07:07.188
Part of what I'm still learning

00:07:07.212 --> 00:07:12.334
is how to balance the doom
and the urgency with things we can do,

00:07:12.358 --> 00:07:15.184
because Greta Thunberg
and the Extinction Rebellion

00:07:15.208 --> 00:07:17.364
don't want our hope --
they want us to act.

00:07:17.388 --> 00:07:18.935
So what can we do?

00:07:19.872 --> 00:07:24.782
It's hard to imagine life
without a weather service,

00:07:24.806 --> 00:07:27.121
but before modern weather forecasting,

00:07:27.145 --> 00:07:29.196
we had no commercial air travel,

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.088
it was common for ships to be lost at sea,

00:07:33.112 --> 00:07:36.388
and a single storm could produce
a food shortage.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.896
Once we had radio and telegraph networks,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.228
all that was necessary
to solve these problems

00:07:43.252 --> 00:07:45.443
was tracking the movement of storms.

00:07:46.705 --> 00:07:51.089
And that laid the foundation
for a global data collection effort,

00:07:51.113 --> 00:07:55.324
one that every household
and every business depends upon today.

00:07:55.987 --> 00:07:59.724
And this was as much the result of
coordinated and consistent data collection

00:07:59.748 --> 00:08:05.155
as it was the result of producing
a culture that saw greater value

00:08:05.179 --> 00:08:10.026
in openly assessing and sharing everything
that it could find out and discover

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.001
about the risks we face.

00:08:13.108 --> 00:08:17.041
A global weather service for water
would help us forecast water shortages.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:23.359
It could help us implement rationing
well before reservoirs run dry.

00:08:23.942 --> 00:08:27.197
It could help us detect
contamination before it spreads.

00:08:27.221 --> 00:08:29.601
It could protect our supply chains,

00:08:29.625 --> 00:08:31.479
secure our food supplies,

00:08:31.503 --> 00:08:33.149
and, perhaps most importantly,

00:08:33.173 --> 00:08:36.611
it would enable
the precise estimation of risk

00:08:36.635 --> 00:08:39.376
necessary to insure against it.

00:08:40.062 --> 00:08:43.259
We know we can do this because
we've already done it with weather.

00:08:43.283 --> 00:08:45.580
But it's going to require resources.

00:08:46.683 --> 00:08:49.489
We need to encourage
greater investment in water.

00:08:49.513 --> 00:08:51.625
Investors, venture capitalists:

00:08:51.649 --> 00:08:55.372
a portion of your funds and portfolios
should be dedicated to water.

00:08:55.715 --> 00:08:57.259
Nothing is more valuable

00:08:57.283 --> 00:09:01.054
and, after all, businesses are going
to need to understand water risks

00:09:01.078 --> 00:09:04.462
in order to remain competitive
in the world we are entering.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.455
Aside from venture capital,

00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:10.758
there are also lots of promising
government programs

00:09:10.782 --> 00:09:14.272
that encourage economic development
through tax incentives.

00:09:14.665 --> 00:09:17.494
A new option in the US
that my company is using

00:09:17.518 --> 00:09:19.107
is called "opportunity zones."

00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:23.557
They offer favorable tax treatment
for investing capital gains

00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:26.916
in designated distressed
and low-income areas.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.737
Now, these are areas

00:09:28.761 --> 00:09:31.375
that are also facing
staggering water risk,

00:09:31.399 --> 00:09:34.952
so this creates crucial incentives
to work directly with the communities

00:09:34.976 --> 00:09:36.756
who need help most.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:41.107
And if you're not looking
to make this type of investment

00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:42.660
but you own land in the US,

00:09:42.684 --> 00:09:46.238
did you know that
you can leverage your land

00:09:46.262 --> 00:09:49.177
to conserve water quality permanently

00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:51.218
with a conservation easement?

00:09:51.242 --> 00:09:54.851
You can assign the perpetual right
to a local land trust

00:09:54.875 --> 00:09:56.488
to conserve your land

00:09:56.512 --> 00:09:58.446
and set specific water quality goals.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:00.180
And if you meet those goals,

00:10:00.204 --> 00:10:04.562
you can be rewarded with
a substantial tax discount every year.

00:10:06.435 --> 00:10:10.845
How many areas could
our global community protect

00:10:10.869 --> 00:10:13.475
through these and other programs?

00:10:14.435 --> 00:10:17.918
They're powerful because they offer
the access to real property

00:10:17.942 --> 00:10:22.131
necessary to lay the foundation
for a global weather service for water.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:28.755
But this can only work if we use
these programs as they are intended

00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:32.066
and not as mere vehicles for tax evasion.

00:10:33.072 --> 00:10:35.333
When the conservation easement
was established,

00:10:35.357 --> 00:10:38.615
nobody could anticipate how ingrained
in environmental movements

00:10:38.639 --> 00:10:40.917
corporate polluters would become.

00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:45.652
And we've become accustomed to companies
talking about the climate crisis

00:10:45.676 --> 00:10:48.048
while doing nothing about it.

00:10:49.738 --> 00:10:54.379
This has undermined the legacy
and the impact of these programs,

00:10:54.403 --> 00:10:57.085
but it also makes them
ripe for reclamation.

00:10:57.109 --> 00:11:00.207
Why not use conservation easements
as they were intended,

00:11:00.231 --> 00:11:04.581
to set and reach
ambitious conservation goals?

00:11:04.605 --> 00:11:08.908
Why not create opportunities
in opportunity zones?

00:11:09.456 --> 00:11:13.826
Because fundamentally,
water security requires accountability.

00:11:14.444 --> 00:11:20.162
Accountability is not corporate polluters
sponsoring environmental groups

00:11:20.186 --> 00:11:21.995
and museums.

00:11:22.019 --> 00:11:24.059
Those are conflicts of interest.

00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:29.204
(Applause)

00:11:30.126 --> 00:11:32.205
Accountability is:

00:11:33.143 --> 00:11:37.403
making the risk of liability too expensive

00:11:37.427 --> 00:11:40.405
to continue polluting
and wasting our water.

00:11:40.429 --> 00:11:44.209
We can't keep settling for words.
It's time to act.

00:11:44.233 --> 00:11:47.701
And where better to start
than with our biggest polluters,

00:11:47.725 --> 00:11:52.804
particularly the US Department
of Defense, which is taxpayer-funded.

00:11:52.828 --> 00:11:56.501
Who and what are we protecting
when US soldiers, their families

00:11:56.525 --> 00:12:00.012
and the people who live near
US military bases abroad

00:12:00.036 --> 00:12:02.308
are all drinking toxic water?

00:12:02.876 --> 00:12:07.323
Global security can no longer remain
at odds with protecting our planet

00:12:07.347 --> 00:12:08.787
or our collective health.

00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:10.958
Our survival depends on it.

00:12:11.404 --> 00:12:12.554
Similarly,

00:12:13.178 --> 00:12:17.054
agriculture in most countries
depends on taxpayer-funded subsidies

00:12:17.078 --> 00:12:20.945
that are paid to farmers to secure
and stabilize food supplies.

00:12:22.039 --> 00:12:26.417
These incentives are
a crucial leverage point for us,

00:12:26.441 --> 00:12:30.971
because agriculture is responsible
for consuming 70 percent

00:12:30.995 --> 00:12:33.353
of all the water we use every year.

00:12:34.061 --> 00:12:36.713
Fertilizer and pesticide runoff

00:12:36.737 --> 00:12:39.436
are the two biggest sources
of water pollution.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:43.225
Let's restructure these subsidies
to demand better water efficiency

00:12:43.249 --> 00:12:44.971
and less pollution.

00:12:44.995 --> 00:12:50.105
(Applause)

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.199
Finally:

00:12:52.223 --> 00:12:53.695
we can't expect progress

00:12:53.719 --> 00:12:56.597
if we're unwilling to confront
the conflicts of interest

00:12:56.621 --> 00:12:58.478
that suppress science,

00:12:58.502 --> 00:13:00.450
that undermine innovation

00:13:00.474 --> 00:13:02.932
and that discourage transparency.

00:13:02.956 --> 00:13:04.756
It is in the public interest

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.728
to measure and to share everything
we can learn and discover

00:13:08.752 --> 00:13:11.341
about the risks we face in water.

00:13:11.881 --> 00:13:15.451
Reality does not exist
until it's measured.

00:13:15.475 --> 00:13:19.274
It doesn't just take
technology to measure it.

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:21.177
It takes our collective will.

00:13:21.201 --> 00:13:22.535
Thank you.

00:13:22.559 --> 00:13:27.603
(Applause)
