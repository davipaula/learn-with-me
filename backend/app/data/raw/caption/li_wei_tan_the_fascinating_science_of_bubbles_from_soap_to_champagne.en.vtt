00:00:12.772 --> 00:00:15.555
Some years ago, I was visiting Paris

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:19.904
and walking along the Seine River
during a beautiful summer afternoon.

00:00:19.928 --> 00:00:23.177
I saw giant bubbles
floating on the riverbank,

00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:24.612
like this one.

00:00:24.636 --> 00:00:27.589
The next moment, it popped and was gone.

00:00:28.273 --> 00:00:32.289
Making them were two street performers
surrounded by a crowd.

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:36.244
They visibly make a living
by asking for donations

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:40.128
and by selling pairs of sticks
tied with two strings.

00:00:40.152 --> 00:00:45.219
When I was there, a man bought
a pair of sticks for 10 euros,

00:00:45.243 --> 00:00:46.995
which surprised me.

00:00:47.773 --> 00:00:51.686
I am a scientist who is
passionate about bubbles.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.066
I know the right trick
to make the giant bubbles

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.491
is the right soapy water mixture itself --

00:00:58.515 --> 00:00:59.946
not the sticks,

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.281
which may be needed,

00:01:01.305 --> 00:01:03.448
but you can easily make them at home.

00:01:03.924 --> 00:01:09.566
Focusing on the sticks makes us not see
that the real tool is the bubble itself.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.102
Bubbles might seem like something
just children make while playing,

00:01:16.117 --> 00:01:18.540
but sometimes it can be really stunning.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.997
However, there are more
fascinating science to bubbles,

00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:26.668
such as problem-solving tools.

00:01:27.192 --> 00:01:29.565
So I would like to share with you

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:33.260
a few stories about
the science of creating bubbles

00:01:33.284 --> 00:01:37.279
and the science of eliminating
the microscopic ones.

00:01:37.742 --> 00:01:41.660
Since it's up on the screen,
let's start with the soap bubble.

00:01:42.478 --> 00:01:45.524
It is made from very common substances:

00:01:45.548 --> 00:01:49.325
air, water, soap, in the right mixture.

00:01:50.214 --> 00:01:53.815
You can see soap bubbles
constantly changing their colors.

00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:58.336
This is due to the interaction with light
at various directions

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.477
and the changes of their thickness.

00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:05.230
One of the common substances,
water molecules,

00:02:05.254 --> 00:02:11.651
are formed by two atoms of hydrogen
and one atom of oxygen -- H2O.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.141
On most surfaces, water droplets
tend to curve inwards,

00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:19.538
forming a semihemisphere shape.

00:02:20.237 --> 00:02:25.007
This is because the water droplet's
surface is like an elastic sheet.

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:29.753
The water molecule on the surface
is constantly being pulled inwards

00:02:29.777 --> 00:02:31.699
by the molecule at the center.

00:02:32.826 --> 00:02:37.850
And the quality of the elasticity
is what we call "surface tension."

00:02:38.422 --> 00:02:40.473
Now by adding soap,

00:02:40.497 --> 00:02:45.041
what happens is the soap molecule
reduces the surface tension of water,

00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:48.989
making it more elastic
and easier to form bubbles.

00:02:50.505 --> 00:02:55.224
You can think of a bubble
as a mathematical problem-solver.

00:02:55.779 --> 00:03:00.821
You see it relentlessly trying
to achieve geometry perfection.

00:03:00.845 --> 00:03:06.657
For instance, a sphere is the shape
with the least surface area

00:03:06.681 --> 00:03:08.298
for a given volume.

00:03:08.322 --> 00:03:12.666
That's why a single bubble
is always in the shape of a sphere.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.526
Let me show you. Check it out.

00:03:30.112 --> 00:03:31.930
This is a single bubble.

00:03:31.954 --> 00:03:34.221
When two bubbles touch each other,

00:03:37.437 --> 00:03:40.671
they can save materials
by sharing a common wall.

00:03:48.385 --> 00:03:51.310
When more and more bubbles
are added together,

00:03:51.334 --> 00:03:53.163
their geometry changes.

00:03:53.556 --> 00:03:55.915
These four bubbles are added together.

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:58.209
They meet at one point at the center.

00:04:42.871 --> 00:04:45.241
When six bubbles are added together,

00:04:45.265 --> 00:04:47.905
a magical cube appears at the center.

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:51.557
(Applause)

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:57.742
That is surface tension at work,

00:04:57.766 --> 00:05:01.704
trying to find the most effective
geometry arrangement.

00:05:03.693 --> 00:05:08.198
Now, let me give you another example.

00:05:09.153 --> 00:05:12.155
This is a very simple prop.

00:05:13.258 --> 00:05:17.166
This is made from two layers of plastic

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.676
with four pins connected to each other.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:25.690
Imagine these four pins represent
four cities that are equally apart,

00:05:25.714 --> 00:05:29.419
and we would like to make roads
to connect these four cities.

00:05:30.426 --> 00:05:34.670
My question is: What is the shortest
length to connect these four cities?

00:05:35.723 --> 00:05:39.624
Let's find out the answer
by dipping it into the soapy water.

00:05:43.775 --> 00:05:49.298
Remember, the soap bubble forms
will always try to minimize

00:05:49.322 --> 00:05:50.922
their surface area

00:05:50.946 --> 00:05:53.652
with a perfect geometry arrangement.

00:05:54.632 --> 00:05:59.741
So the solution might not be
something you expected.

00:06:02.175 --> 00:06:05.583
The shortest length
to connect these four cities

00:06:05.607 --> 00:06:11.471
is 2.73 times the distance
between these two cities.

00:06:11.495 --> 00:06:15.788
(Applause)

00:06:17.401 --> 00:06:19.367
Now you've got the idea.

00:06:19.391 --> 00:06:24.670
The soap bubble forms will always try
to minimize their surface area

00:06:24.694 --> 00:06:27.098
with a perfect geometry arrangement.

00:06:29.416 --> 00:06:35.289
Now, let us look at bubbles
in another perspective.

00:06:36.357 --> 00:06:40.265
My daughter, Zoe, loves visiting zoos.

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:46.218
Her favorite spot is Penguin Cove
at Marwell Zoo in Southern England,

00:06:46.242 --> 00:06:50.674
where she could see penguins
swim at speed under the water.

00:06:51.653 --> 00:06:55.432
One day, she noticed
that the body of penguins

00:06:55.456 --> 00:06:58.456
leaves a trail of bubbles when they swim

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.360
and asked why.

00:07:00.384 --> 00:07:03.351
Animals and birds like penguins

00:07:03.375 --> 00:07:06.873
that spend a lot of their time
under the water

00:07:06.897 --> 00:07:13.312
have evolved an ingenious way
of utilizing the capability of bubbles

00:07:13.336 --> 00:07:15.942
to reduce the density of water.

00:07:17.066 --> 00:07:21.778
Emperor penguins are thought to be able
to dive a few hundred meters

00:07:21.802 --> 00:07:23.909
below the sea surface.

00:07:24.562 --> 00:07:28.254
They are thought to store
the air under their feathers

00:07:28.278 --> 00:07:29.933
before they dive

00:07:29.957 --> 00:07:34.726
and then progressively release it
as a cloud of bubbles.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.968
This reduces the density
of water surrounding them,

00:07:38.992 --> 00:07:41.777
making it easier to swim through

00:07:41.801 --> 00:07:46.630
and speed up their swimming speed
at least 40 percent.

00:07:47.779 --> 00:07:51.508
This feature has been noticed
by the ship manufacturers.

00:07:52.364 --> 00:07:55.853
I am talking about the big ships here,

00:07:55.877 --> 00:08:00.884
the ones that are used to transport
thousands of containers across the ocean.

00:08:01.559 --> 00:08:06.961
Recently, they developed a system
called "air lubricating system,"

00:08:06.985 --> 00:08:08.950
inspired by the penguins.

00:08:09.704 --> 00:08:13.870
In this system, they produce
a lot of air bubbles

00:08:13.894 --> 00:08:17.983
and redistribute them across
the whole of the ship,

00:08:18.007 --> 00:08:22.567
like an air carpet
that reduces the water resistance

00:08:22.591 --> 00:08:24.778
when a ship is moving.

00:08:26.167 --> 00:08:30.185
This feature cuts off the energy
consumption for the ship

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:32.826
up to 15 percent.

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:38.364
Bubbles can also be used for medicines.

00:08:38.388 --> 00:08:41.268
It can also play a role in medicines,

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:49.858
for instance, as a method for noninvasive
delivery systems for drugs and genes

00:08:49.882 --> 00:08:52.388
to a specific part of the body.

00:08:52.412 --> 00:08:54.468
Imagine a microbubble

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:58.589
filled with a mixture
of drugs and magnetic agents

00:08:58.613 --> 00:09:01.058
being injected into our bloodstream.

00:09:02.273 --> 00:09:05.685
The bubbles will move to the target areas.

00:09:05.709 --> 00:09:08.312
But how do they know where to go?

00:09:08.336 --> 00:09:10.452
Because we placed a magnet there.

00:09:10.476 --> 00:09:12.837
For instance, this part of my hand.

00:09:12.861 --> 00:09:16.873
When the microbubbles
move to this part of my hand,

00:09:16.897 --> 00:09:20.688
we can pop it via ultrasound

00:09:20.712 --> 00:09:24.210
and release the drug
exactly where it's needed.

00:09:25.895 --> 00:09:29.369
Now, I mentioned about
the science of creating bubbles.

00:09:29.393 --> 00:09:33.694
But sometimes we also need to remove them.

00:09:33.718 --> 00:09:36.018
That's actually part of my job.

00:09:36.731 --> 00:09:41.609
My exact job title is
"ink formulation scientist."

00:09:41.633 --> 00:09:45.683
But I don't work on the ink
that you use for your writing pens.

00:09:46.366 --> 00:09:49.178
I'm working on some cool applications

00:09:49.202 --> 00:09:53.622
such as organic photovoltaics, OPVs,

00:09:53.646 --> 00:09:57.318
and organic light-emitting diodes, OLEDs.

00:09:57.342 --> 00:10:03.622
Part of my job is to figure out
how and why we want to remove the bubbles

00:10:03.646 --> 00:10:06.132
from the ink that my company produces.

00:10:06.989 --> 00:10:10.251
During the formulation-mixing process,

00:10:10.275 --> 00:10:12.034
or preparation process,

00:10:12.058 --> 00:10:18.253
we mix active ingredients,
solvents and additives

00:10:18.277 --> 00:10:22.806
in order to achieve the formulations
with the properties we want

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.466
when the ink is being used.

00:10:25.196 --> 00:10:28.113
But just like you would make drinks

00:10:28.137 --> 00:10:29.407
or bake cakes,

00:10:29.431 --> 00:10:34.987
it is unavoidable that some air bubbles
will be trapped inside that ink.

00:10:35.686 --> 00:10:38.948
Here, we are talking
about a different space

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:41.841
from the bubbles I'd seen in Paris.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.162
The bubbles that are trapped
inside those inks

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:48.117
vary between a few millimeters,

00:10:48.141 --> 00:10:49.384
a few microns

00:10:49.408 --> 00:10:52.381
or even a few nanometers in size.

00:10:52.405 --> 00:10:54.328
And what we are concerned about

00:10:54.352 --> 00:10:57.351
is the oxygen and the moisture
that is trapped inside.

00:10:58.525 --> 00:11:04.230
At this size scale,
removing them is not easy.

00:11:04.254 --> 00:11:06.186
But it matters,

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:10.325
for instance, for organic
light-emitting diodes inks

00:11:11.772 --> 00:11:18.744
that we can use to produce display
for your smartphone, for example.

00:11:19.674 --> 00:11:21.909
It's supposed to last for many years,

00:11:21.933 --> 00:11:26.953
but if the ink that we use has been
absorbed with oxygen and moisture

00:11:26.977 --> 00:11:29.340
[which] are not being removed,

00:11:29.364 --> 00:11:34.234
then we can quickly see
dark spots appear in the pixels.

00:11:34.943 --> 00:11:41.926
Now, one challenge we face
in removing the microbubbles

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:45.396
is that they are not very cooperative.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.368
They like to sit there,

00:11:47.392 --> 00:11:50.278
bathing in the ink without moving much.

00:11:50.937 --> 00:11:52.899
But how do we kick them out?

00:11:54.741 --> 00:11:56.836
One technology we use

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:02.401
is to force the ink going through
a thin, long and tiny tube

00:12:02.425 --> 00:12:04.556
with a porous wall,

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:07.691
and we place the tubes
inside the vacuum chamber,

00:12:07.715 --> 00:12:12.055
so that the bubbles can be
squeezed out from the ink

00:12:12.079 --> 00:12:13.434
and be removed.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:20.374
Once we manage to remove the bubbles
from the ink that we produce,

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.696
it is time for celebration.

00:12:25.726 --> 00:12:28.741
Let's open a bubbling champagne.

00:12:35.693 --> 00:12:37.881
Ooh, this is going to be fun!

00:12:37.905 --> 00:12:40.890
(Laughter)

00:12:42.327 --> 00:12:44.657
Woooo!

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:48.387
(Applause)

00:12:52.317 --> 00:12:58.045
You could see a lot of bubbles
rushing out from the champagne bottle.

00:12:58.566 --> 00:13:02.909
These are the bubbles
filled with carbon dioxide,

00:13:02.933 --> 00:13:08.471
a gas that's been produced during
the fermentation process of the wine.

00:13:09.226 --> 00:13:10.969
Let me pour some out.

00:13:12.919 --> 00:13:14.656
I can't miss the chance.

00:13:22.292 --> 00:13:24.383
I guess it's enough.

00:13:24.407 --> 00:13:25.614
(Laughter)

00:13:29.178 --> 00:13:34.370
Here, I can see a lot of microbubbles

00:13:34.394 --> 00:13:39.410
moving from the bottom of the glass
to the top of the champagne.

00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:41.889
Before it pops,

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:47.878
it will jet tiny droplets
of aroma molecules

00:13:47.902 --> 00:13:51.573
and intensify the flavor of champagne,

00:13:51.597 --> 00:13:55.296
making us enjoy much more
the flavor of champagne.

00:13:56.226 --> 00:13:59.728
As a scientist who is
passionate about bubbles,

00:13:59.752 --> 00:14:01.462
I love to see them,

00:14:02.306 --> 00:14:04.441
I love to play with them,

00:14:04.465 --> 00:14:06.733
and I love to study them.

00:14:06.757 --> 00:14:09.009
And also, I love to drink them.

00:14:09.033 --> 00:14:10.242
Thank you.

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:14.728
(Applause)
