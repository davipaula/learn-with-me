00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.240
I bet all of you are familiar
with this view of the ocean,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.536
but the thing is,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.760
most of the ocean looks nothing like this.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.856
Below the sunlit surface waters,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.896
there's an otherworldly realm

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.560
known as the twilight zone.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.776
At 200 to 1,000 meters below the surface,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.136
sunlight is barely a glimmer.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.256
Tiny particles swirl down
through the darkness

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.816
while flashes of bioluminescence

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.136
give us a clue that
these waters teem with life:

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:46.576
microbes, plankton, fish.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.856
Everything that lives here
has amazing adaptations

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.000
for the challenges
of such an extreme environment.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.976
These animals help support
top predators such as whales, tuna,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.800
swordfish and sharks.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.496
There could be 10 times
more fish biomass here

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.176
than previously thought.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.120
In fact, maybe more
than all the rest of the ocean combined.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.856
There are countless
undiscovered species in deep waters,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.600
and life in the twilight zone
is intertwined with earth's climate.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.256
Yet the twilight zone
is virtually unexplored.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.920
There are so many things
we still don't know about it.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.760
I think we can change that.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.296
I was drawn to oceanography
by just this kind of challenge.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.496
To me it represents
the perfect intersection

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.656
of science, technology and the unknown,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.640
the spark for so many breakthrough
discoveries about life on our planet.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.816
As a college student,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.536
I went on an expedition
across the Atlantic

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.136
with a team of scientists
using a high-powered laser

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.000
to measure microscopic algae.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.416
The wild thing that happened on that trip

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.960
is that we discovered what everyone
who looked before had completely missed:

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.520
photosynthetic cells
smaller than anyone thought possible.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.616
We now know those tiny cells
are the most abundant

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.880
photosynthetic organisms on earth.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.336
This amazing discovery happened
because we used new technology

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.200
to see life in the ocean in a new way.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.616
I am convinced that the discoveries
awaiting us in the twilight zone

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.840
will be just as breathtaking.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.296
We know so little about the twilight zone
because it's difficult to study.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.136
It's exceedingly large,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.336
spanning from the Arctic
to the Southern Ocean

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.696
and around the globe.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.136
It's different from place to place.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.416
It changes quickly
as the water and animals move.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.600
And it's deep and dark and cold,
and the pressures there are enormous.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.400
What we do know is fascinating.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.200
You may be imagining
huge monsters lurking in the deep sea,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.840
but most of the animals are very small,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.560
like this lantern fish.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.096
And this fierce-looking fish
is called a bristlemouth.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.056
Believe it or not, these are the most
abundant vertebrates on earth

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.880
and many are so small
that a dozen could fit in this one tube.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.056
It gets even more interesting,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.280
because small size does not stop them
from being powerful through sheer number.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.376
Deep, penetrating sonar shows us
that the animals form dense layers.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.856
You can see what I mean
by the red and yellow colors

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.576
around 400 meters in these data.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.576
So much sound bounces off this layer,

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.880
it's been mistaken for the ocean bottom.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.696
But if we look, it can't be,
because the layer is deep during the day,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.736
it rises up at night

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.200
and the pattern repeats day after day.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.656
This is actually the largest
animal migration on earth.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.136
It happens around the globe every day,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.896
sweeping through the world's oceans
in a massive living wave

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.656
as twilight zone inhabitants
travel hundreds of meters

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.296
to surface waters to feed at night

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.480
and return to the relative safety
of deeper, darker waters during the day.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.616
These animals and their movements
help connect the surface and deep ocean

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.920
in important ways.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.696
The animals feed near the surface,

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.495
they bring carbon in their food
into the deep waters,

00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:36.336
where some of that carbon can stay behind

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.280
and remain isolated from the atmosphere
for hundreds or even thousands of years.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.776
In this way, the migration
may help keep carbon dioxide

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.456
out of our atmosphere

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.720
and limit the effects
of global warming on our climate.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.136
But we still have many questions.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.416
We don't know which species are migrating,

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.976
what they're finding to eat,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.776
who is trying to eat them

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.240
or how much carbon
they are able to transport.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.040
So I'm a scientist
who studies life in the ocean.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.480
For me, curiosity about these things
is a powerful driver,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.280
but there's more to the motivation here.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.736
We need to answer these questions
and answer them quickly,

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.360
because the twilight zone is under threat.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.136
Factory ships in the open ocean

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.576
have been vacuuming up

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.520
hundreds of thousands of tons of small,
shrimp-like animals called krill.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.176
The animals are ground into fish meal

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.416
to support increasing demands
for aquaculture

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.416
and for nutraceuticals such as krill oil.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.736
Industry is on the brink
of deepening fisheries such as these

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.456
into the mid-water

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.896
in what could start
a kind of twilight zone gold rush

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.280
operating outside the reach
of national fishing regulations.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.656
This could have irreversible
global-scale impacts

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.080
on marine life and food webs.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.016
We need to get out
ahead of fishing impacts

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.040
and work to understand
this critical part of the ocean.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.776
At Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.000
I'm really fortunate to be surrounded
by colleagues who share this passion.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.336
Together, we are ready
to launch a large-scale exploration

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.600
of the twilight zone.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.216
We have a plan to begin right away

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.136
with expeditions in the North Atlantic,

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.256
where we'll tackle the big challenges

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.440
of observing and studying
the twilight zone's remarkable diversity.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.576
This kind of multiscale,
multidimensional exploration

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.200
means we need to integrate
new technologies.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.280
Let me show you a recent example
that has changed our thinking.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.616
Satellite tracking devices
on animals such as sharks

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.496
are now showing us that many top predators

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.440
regularly dive deep
into the twilight zone to feed.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.136
And when we map their swimming patterns
and compare them to satellite data,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.176
we find that their feeding hot spots

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.120
are linked to ocean currents
and other features.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.840
We used to think these animals
found all of their food in surface waters.

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.760
We now believe they depend
on the twilight zone.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.456
But we still need to figure out
how they find the best areas to feed,

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.976
what they're eating there

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.880
and how much their diets depend
on twilight zone species.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.400
We will also need new technologies
to explore the links with climate.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.760
Remember these particles?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.640
Some of them are produced
by gelatinous animals called salps.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.536
Salps are like superefficient
vacuum cleaners,

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:48.256
slurping up plankton and producing
fast-sinking pellets of poop --

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.416
try saying that 10 times fast --

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.680
pellets of poop that carry carbon
deep into the ocean.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.256
We sometimes find salps
in enormous swarms.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.176
We need to know where
and when and why and whether

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.120
this kind of carbon sink
has a big impact on earth's climate.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.120
To meet these challenges, we will need
to push the limits of technology.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.976
We will deploy cameras
and samplers on smart robots

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.840
to patrol the depths and help us track
the secret lives of animals like salps.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.576
We will use advanced sonar

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.560
to figure out how many fish
and other animals are down there.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.696
We will sequence DNA from the environment
in a kind of forensic analysis

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.936
to figure out which species are there

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.200
and what they are eating.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.936
With so much that's still
unknown about the twilight zone,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.400
there's an almost unlimited
opportunity for new discovery.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.559
Just look at these beautiful,
fascinating creatures.

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:50.256
We barely know them.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.096
And imagine how many more
are just down there waiting

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.200
for our new technologies to see them.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.816
The excitement level about this
could not be higher on our team

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.400
of ocean scientists,
engineers and communicators.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.520
There is also a deep sense of urgency.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.696
We can't turn back the clock
on decades of overfishing

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.256
in countless regions of the ocean

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.160
that once seemed inexhaustible.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.320
How amazing would it be
to take a different path this time?

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.600
The twilight zone
is truly a global commons.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.336
We need to first know and understand it

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.216
before we can be responsible stewards

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.560
and hope to fish it sustainably.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.816
This is not just a journey for scientists,

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.776
it is for all of us,

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.736
because the decisions we collectively make

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.656
over the next decade

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.136
will affect what the ocean looks like

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.760
for centuries to come.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.816
Thank you.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.840
(Applause)
