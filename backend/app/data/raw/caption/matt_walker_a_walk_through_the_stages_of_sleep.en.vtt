00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.936
Sleep is perhaps the
single most effective thing

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.073
that we can do each and every day

00:00:05.097 --> 00:00:08.816
to reset the health
of our brain and our body.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.756
And by understanding a little bit more
about what sleep is,

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.238
perhaps we can get the chance to improve
both the quantity and the quality

00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:18.269
of our sleep.

00:00:18.299 --> 00:00:20.136
[Sleeping with Science]

00:00:20.136 --> 00:00:21.800
(Music)

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.807
So, exactly what is sleep?

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.914
Well, sleep, at least in human beings,

00:00:28.938 --> 00:00:31.926
is subdivided into two main types.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.306
On the one hand, we have
non-rapid eye movement sleep,

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.026
or non-REM sleep for short.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.216
But on the other hand,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.226
we have rapid eye movement
sleep, or REM sleep.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.658
And non-REM sleep has been
further subdivided

00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:47.841
into four separate stages,

00:00:47.865 --> 00:00:51.866
unimaginatively called
stages one through four,

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.406
increasing in their depth of sleep.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.226
And as we go into those light stages
of non-REM sleep,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.026
your heart rate starts to decrease,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.186
your body temperature starts to drop

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.236
and your electrical brain wave activity
starts to slow down.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.416
But as we move into deeper
non-rapid eye movement sleep,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.316
stages three and four,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.326
now all of a sudden the brain erupts

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.065
with these huge, big,
powerful brain waves.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.336
The body is actually recharged
in terms of its immune system.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.912
We also get this beautiful overhaul
of our cardiovascular system.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.706
And, in fact, upstairs in the brain,

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.976
deep non-REM sleep
will help consolidate memories

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.676
and fixate them into the neural
architecture of the brain.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.041
So that's non-REM sleep.

00:01:42.065 --> 00:01:44.526
But let's come on to REM sleep,

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.736
which is the other main type of sleep.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.246
And it's during REM sleep
when we principally have the most vivid,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.136
the most hallucinogenic types of dreams.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.236
The brain wave activity
actually starts to speed up again.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.876
It's during REM sleep that we receive
almost a form of emotional first aid.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.376
And it's also during REM sleep
where we get a boost for creativity,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.176
that it stitches information together

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.709
so that we wake up with solutions

00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:18.176
to previously difficult problems
that we were facing.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.556
Coming back to these two types of sleep,

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.836
it turns out that non-REM
and REM will play out

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.616
in a battle for brain domination
throughout the night,

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.046
and that cerebral war
is going to be won and lost

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.836
every 90 minutes,

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.059
and then it's going to be
replayed every 90 minutes.

00:02:38.544 --> 00:02:44.252
And what this produces is a standard
cycling architecture of human sleep,

00:02:44.276 --> 00:02:46.180
a standard 90-minute cycle.

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:48.486
But what's different, however,

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.356
is that the ratio of non-REM to REM
within those 90-minute cycles

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.356
changes as we move across the night,

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.826
such that in the first half the night,

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.606
the majority of those 90-minute cycles

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.006
are comprised of lots
of deep non-REM sleep,

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.966
particularly stages three and four
of non-REM sleep.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.346
But as we push through
to the second half of the night,

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.476
now that seesaw balance
actually shifts over,

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.796
and instead, most of those
90-minute cycles

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.530
are comprised of a lot more
rapid eye movement sleep, or dream sleep,

00:03:25.554 --> 00:03:28.506
as well as stage-two non-REM sleep,

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.696
that lighter form of non-REM sleep.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.268
And it turns out
that there are implications

00:03:34.292 --> 00:03:38.025
for understanding how sleep
is structured in this way.

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.786
Let's take someone who typically
goes to bed at 10pm,

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.817
and they wake up at 6am,

00:03:44.841 --> 00:03:47.068
so they have an eight-hour sleep window.

00:03:47.488 --> 00:03:49.998
But this morning,
they have to wake up early

00:03:50.022 --> 00:03:52.336
for an early morning meeting,

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.426
or they want to get
a jump start on the day

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.816
to get to the gym.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.796
And as a consequence, they have to wake up
at 4am in the morning,

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.036
rather than 6am in the morning.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.376
How much sleep have they actually lost?

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.026
Two hours out of
an eight-hour night of sleep

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.107
means that they've lost
25 percent of their sleep.

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:13.771
Well, yes and no.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:17.116
They have lost 25 percent
of all of their sleep,

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.530
but because REM sleep comes
mostly in the second half of the night

00:04:21.554 --> 00:04:23.546
and particularly in those last few hours,

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.931
they may have lost perhaps
50, 60, maybe even 70 percent

00:04:28.955 --> 00:04:30.746
of all of their REM sleep.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.040
So there are real consequences
to understanding what sleep is

00:04:36.064 --> 00:04:37.786
and how sleep is structured.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.066
And we'll learn all about the benefits
of these different stages of sleep

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.613
and the detriments that happen
when we don't get enough of them

00:04:45.637 --> 00:04:47.277
in subsequent episodes.
