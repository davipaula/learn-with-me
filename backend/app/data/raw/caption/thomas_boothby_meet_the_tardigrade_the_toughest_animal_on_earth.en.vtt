00:00:07.437 --> 00:00:12.818
Without water, a human can only
survive for about 100 hours.

00:00:12.818 --> 00:00:18.148
But there's a creature so resilient
that it can go without it for decades.

00:00:18.148 --> 00:00:21.458
This one millimeter animal can survive
both the hottest

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:24.708
and coldest environments on Earth,

00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:28.519
and can even withstand high levels
of radiation.

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.420
This is the tardigrade,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.289
and it's one of the toughest creatures
on Earth,

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:38.049
even if it does look more like
a chubby, eight-legged gummy bear.

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:40.749
Most organisms need water to survive.

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.059
Water allows metabolism to occur,

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.080
which is the process that drives
all the biochemical reactions

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.249
that take place in cells.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:53.409
But creatures like the tardigrade,
also known as the water bear,

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:58.069
get around this restriction
with a process called anhydrobiosis,

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:01.100
from the Greek meaning
life without water.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.728
And however extraordinary,
tardigrades aren't alone.

00:01:04.728 --> 00:01:05.780
Bacteria,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.309
single-celled organisms called archaea,

00:01:08.309 --> 00:01:09.090
plants,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.269
and even other animals 
can all survive drying up.

00:01:13.269 --> 00:01:14.671
For many tardigrades,

00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:18.571
this requires that they go through 
something called a tun state.

00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:20.030
They curl up into a ball,

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.620
pulling their head and eight legs
inside their body

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.000
and wait until water returns.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.141
It's thought that as water
becomes scarce

00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:31.501
and tardigrades enter their tun state,

00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:34.351
they start synthesize special molecules,

00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:38.041
which fill the tardigrade's cells
to replace lost water

00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:40.430
by forming a matrix.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.080
Components of the cells that are
sensitive to dryness,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.111
like DNA,

00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:45.101
proteins,

00:01:45.101 --> 00:01:46.191
and membranes,

00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:48.580
get trapped in this matrix.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.973
It's thought that this keeps these
molecules locked in position

00:01:51.973 --> 00:01:53.631
to stop them from unfolding,

00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:54.868
breaking apart,

00:01:54.868 --> 00:01:56.931
or fusing together.

00:01:56.931 --> 00:02:00.421
Once the organism is rehydrated,
the matrix dissolves,

00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:03.887
leaving behind undamaged, 
functional cells.

00:02:03.887 --> 00:02:08.151
Beyond dryness, tardigrades can also
tolerate other extreme stresses:

00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:09.416
being frozen,

00:02:09.416 --> 00:02:11.830
heated up past the boiling point
of water,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.507
high levels of radiation,

00:02:13.507 --> 00:02:17.092
and even the vacuum of outer space.

00:02:17.092 --> 00:02:19.221
This has led to some erroneous speculation

00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:22.562
that tardigrades 
are extraterrestrial beings.

00:02:22.562 --> 00:02:24.150
While that's fun to think about,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.751
scientific evidence places their
origin firmly on Earth

00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:29.772
where they've evolved over time.

00:02:29.772 --> 00:02:32.503
In fact, this earthly evolution 
has given rise

00:02:32.503 --> 00:02:36.322
to over 1100 known species of tardigrades

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.653
and there are probably many others
yet to be discovered.

00:02:39.653 --> 00:02:44.783
And because tardigrades are so hardy,
they exist just about everywhere.

00:02:44.783 --> 00:02:48.463
They live on every continent,
including Antarctica.

00:02:48.463 --> 00:02:51.152
And they're in diverse biomes
including deserts,

00:02:51.152 --> 00:02:52.283
ice sheets,

00:02:52.283 --> 00:02:53.182
the sea,

00:02:53.182 --> 00:02:54.143
fresh water,

00:02:54.143 --> 00:02:55.233
rainforests,

00:02:55.233 --> 00:02:57.242
and the highest mountain peaks.

00:02:57.242 --> 00:03:00.913
But you can find tardigrades
in the most ordinary places, too,

00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:02.904
like moss or lichen found in yards,

00:03:02.904 --> 00:03:03.693
parks,

00:03:03.693 --> 00:03:04.963
and forests.

00:03:04.963 --> 00:03:08.403
All you need to find them is a little
patience and a microscope.

00:03:08.403 --> 00:03:12.323
Scientists are now to trying to find out
whether tardigrades use the tun state,

00:03:12.323 --> 00:03:14.364
their anti-drying technique,

00:03:14.364 --> 00:03:16.293
to survive other stresses.

00:03:16.293 --> 00:03:18.683
If we can understand how they,
and other creatures,

00:03:18.683 --> 00:03:21.852
stabilize their sensitive 
biological molecules,

00:03:21.852 --> 00:03:26.043
perhaps we could apply this knowledge
to help us stabilize vaccines,

00:03:26.043 --> 00:03:31.793
or to develop stress-tolerant crops that 
can cope with Earth's changing climate.

00:03:31.793 --> 00:03:34.214
And by studying how tardigrades survive

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:37.373
prolonged exposure 
to the vacuum of outer space,

00:03:37.373 --> 00:03:42.195
scientists can generate clues about
the environmental limits of life

00:03:42.195 --> 00:03:44.205
and how to safeguard astronauts.

00:03:44.205 --> 00:03:49.164
In the process, tardigrades could even
help us answer a critical question:

00:03:49.164 --> 00:03:53.923
could life survive on planets much
less hospitable than our own?
