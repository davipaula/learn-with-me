00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:14.309
[As of the morning February 27, 2020,

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:17.810
there were at least 82,000 confirmed
cases worldwide of the coronavirus

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:19.135
and 2,810 deaths from it.

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:22.946
TED invited Dr. David Heymann to share
the latest findings about the outbreak.]

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.611
[What happens if you get infected
with the coronavirus?]

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:28.435
This looks like a very mild disease,
like a common cold,

00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:30.228
in the majority of people.

00:00:30.252 --> 00:00:34.752
There are certain people who get infected
and have very serious illness;

00:00:34.776 --> 00:00:36.227
among them are health workers.

00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:38.061
It's a very serious infection in them,

00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:40.410
as they get a higher dose
than normal people,

00:00:40.434 --> 00:00:42.831
and at the same time,
they have no immunity.

00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:46.910
So in the general population,

00:00:46.934 --> 00:00:51.133
it's likely that the dose of virus
that you receive when you are infected

00:00:51.157 --> 00:00:54.371
is much less than the dose
that a health worker would receive,

00:00:54.395 --> 00:00:56.680
health workers having
more serious infections.

00:00:56.704 --> 00:00:59.704
So your infection
would be less serious, hopefully.

00:00:59.728 --> 00:01:03.057
So that leaves the elderly
and those with comorbidities

00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:05.633
to really be the ones
that we have to make sure

00:01:05.657 --> 00:01:07.822
are taken care of in hospitals.

00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:11.863
[Who are the people who should be
most concerned about this?]

00:01:12.395 --> 00:01:14.621
Well, the most concerned are people

00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:17.760
who are, first of all,
in developing countries

00:01:17.784 --> 00:01:20.569
and who don't have access
to good medical care

00:01:20.593 --> 00:01:23.292
and may not have access
at all to a hospital,

00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:26.450
should an epidemic occur in their country.

00:01:26.474 --> 00:01:28.228
Those people would be at great risk,

00:01:28.252 --> 00:01:29.664
especially the elderly.

00:01:29.688 --> 00:01:32.315
Elderly in all populations are at risk,

00:01:32.339 --> 00:01:35.014
but especially those
who can't get to oxygen.

00:01:35.038 --> 00:01:36.670
In industrialized countries,

00:01:36.694 --> 00:01:39.404
it's the very elderly
who have comorbidities,

00:01:39.428 --> 00:01:41.682
who have diabetes,
who have other diseases,

00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:42.918
who are at risk.

00:01:42.942 --> 00:01:45.959
The general population
doesn't appear to be at great risk.

00:01:45.983 --> 00:01:50.126
[What pre-existing medical conditions
put people at higher risk?]

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.309
First of all,

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:55.133
pulmonary disease existing
as a comorbidity is also important.

00:01:55.157 --> 00:01:57.661
In general, the elderly
are at greater risk,

00:01:57.685 --> 00:01:59.768
especially those over 70,

00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:02.860
because their immune systems
are not as effective

00:02:02.884 --> 00:02:04.447
as they might have once been,

00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:07.289
and they are more
susceptible to infections.

00:02:07.313 --> 00:02:10.773
In addition, in some instances in China,

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:14.075
there's been a coinfection with influenza

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.258
and at the same time,

00:02:15.282 --> 00:02:17.575
there have been some
bacterial superinfections

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.508
on the pneumonias that are occurring.

00:02:19.532 --> 00:02:22.535
[Where can we find
up-to-date information?]

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.475
The Center for Disease Control
in Atlanta keeps track

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:29.213
and has updates on a regular
basis on its website.

00:02:29.237 --> 00:02:31.848
Also, the World Health
Organization in Geneva,

00:02:31.872 --> 00:02:33.990
which is coordinating many
of the activities

00:02:34.014 --> 00:02:35.482
going on internationally,

00:02:35.506 --> 00:02:37.862
also has a website with daily updates.

00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:41.466
It's our responsibility
to get that information as individuals,

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.871
so we understand

00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:45.641
and can make sure that we can
contribute in our own way

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.665
to prevention of major spread.

00:02:48.011 --> 00:02:50.776
[You led the global response
to the SARS outbreak in 2003.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.384
How does this outbreak compare?]

00:02:52.408 --> 00:02:54.654
That's the same problem
with all new infections.

00:02:54.678 --> 00:02:57.210
This is an infection
that's coming to humans

00:02:57.234 --> 00:03:00.336
who have never been exposed
to this virus before.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.728
They don't have any antibody protection,

00:03:02.752 --> 00:03:05.282
and it's not clear whether
their immune system

00:03:05.306 --> 00:03:07.268
can handle this virus or not.

00:03:07.292 --> 00:03:11.959
This is a virus that usually finds itself
in bats or in other animals,

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:13.800
and all of a sudden, it's in humans.

00:03:13.824 --> 00:03:16.982
And humans just don't have
experience with this virus.

00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:18.164
But gradually,

00:03:18.188 --> 00:03:20.997
we are beginning to learn a lot,
as we did with SARS.

00:03:21.021 --> 00:03:24.887
And you know, there are certainly
a larger number of deaths

00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:26.728
than there were with SARS.

00:03:26.752 --> 00:03:30.950
But when you divide that by a denominator
of persons who are infected,

00:03:30.974 --> 00:03:34.236
there are many, many more persons infected
than there were with SARS.

00:03:34.577 --> 00:03:36.112
The case fatality ratio,

00:03:36.136 --> 00:03:40.648
that is the ratio of deaths
to the numbers of cases in SARS,

00:03:40.672 --> 00:03:42.276
was about 10 percent.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.355
With the current coronavirus, COVID-19,

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.776
it is two percent or probably less.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.164
So it's a much less virulent virus,

00:03:51.188 --> 00:03:53.625
but it's still a virus
that causes mortality,

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:56.594
and that's what we don't want
entering human populations.

00:03:56.618 --> 00:04:00.383
[Have we responded adequately
at border crossings, such as airports?]

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:04.700
It's clearly understood
that airports or any land borders

00:04:04.724 --> 00:04:06.954
cannot prevent a disease from entering.

00:04:06.978 --> 00:04:09.768
People in the incubation period
can cross that border,

00:04:09.792 --> 00:04:11.117
can enter countries

00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:14.315
and can then infect others
when they become sick.

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:20.323
So borders are not a means of preventing
infections from entering a country

00:04:20.347 --> 00:04:22.014
by checking temperatures.

00:04:22.355 --> 00:04:26.045
Borders are important because
you can provide to people arriving

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:29.697
from areas that might be at risk
of having had infection,

00:04:29.721 --> 00:04:31.776
provide them with an understanding,

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.934
either a printed understanding
or a verbal understanding,

00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:37.823
of what the signs and symptoms are
of this infection,

00:04:37.847 --> 00:04:41.563
and what they should do
if they feel that they might be infected.

00:04:41.587 --> 00:04:44.725
[What's the timeline for a vaccine?]

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:46.813
Vaccines are under development right now,

00:04:46.837 --> 00:04:48.971
there's a lot of research going on.

00:04:48.995 --> 00:04:52.908
That research requires first
that the vaccine be developed,

00:04:52.932 --> 00:04:57.330
then that it be studied for safety
and effectiveness in animals,

00:04:57.354 --> 00:05:00.861
who are challenged with the virus
after they are vaccinated,

00:05:00.885 --> 00:05:03.234
and then it must go into human studies.

00:05:03.258 --> 00:05:05.371
The animal studies have not yet begun,

00:05:05.395 --> 00:05:07.942
but will soon begin for certain vaccines.

00:05:07.966 --> 00:05:10.109
And it's thought
that by the end of the year,

00:05:10.133 --> 00:05:11.291
or early next year,

00:05:11.315 --> 00:05:13.738
there may be some candidate vaccines

00:05:13.762 --> 00:05:18.585
that can then be studied for licensing
by regulatory agencies.

00:05:18.609 --> 00:05:22.728
So we're talking about at least a year
until there's vaccine available

00:05:22.752 --> 00:05:25.314
that can be used in many populations.

00:05:25.338 --> 00:05:28.993
[What questions about the outbreak
are still unanswered?]

00:05:29.347 --> 00:05:31.164
It's clear we know how it transmits,

00:05:31.188 --> 00:05:33.827
we don't know how easily
it transmits in humans,

00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:38.220
in communities or in unenclosed areas.

00:05:38.244 --> 00:05:39.958
We know, for example,

00:05:39.982 --> 00:05:43.847
that in the enclosed area
of a cruise ship, it spread very easily.

00:05:43.871 --> 00:05:45.498
We need to better understand

00:05:45.522 --> 00:05:48.989
how it will spread once it gets
into more open areas

00:05:49.013 --> 00:05:52.367
where people are exposed
to people who might be sick.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.486
[What about the global response
could be improved?]

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.237
A major problem in the world today
is that we look at outbreaks

00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:01.815
in developing countries

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:04.363
as something that we need to go and stop.

00:06:04.728 --> 00:06:06.506
So when there's an outbreak of Ebola,

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.530
we think "How can we go
and stop this outbreak in the country?"

00:06:09.554 --> 00:06:13.117
We don't think about
"How can we help that country

00:06:13.141 --> 00:06:15.044
strengthen its capacity,

00:06:15.068 --> 00:06:18.629
so that it can detect
and respond to infections?"

00:06:18.653 --> 00:06:21.098
So we haven't invested enough

00:06:21.122 --> 00:06:25.061
in helping countries develop
their core capacity in public health.

00:06:25.411 --> 00:06:29.291
What we've done is invested
in many mechanisms globally,

00:06:29.315 --> 00:06:32.252
which can provide support
to other countries

00:06:32.276 --> 00:06:34.307
to go and help stop outbreaks.

00:06:34.331 --> 00:06:36.569
But we want to see a world
where every country

00:06:36.593 --> 00:06:38.810
can do its best to stop its own outbreaks.

00:06:38.834 --> 00:06:41.926
[Will we see more emerging
disease outbreaks in the future?]

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.958
Today, there are over
seven billion people.

00:06:43.982 --> 00:06:46.022
And when those people come into the world,

00:06:46.046 --> 00:06:47.292
they demand more food,

00:06:47.316 --> 00:06:49.101
they demand a whole series of things

00:06:49.125 --> 00:06:50.562
and they live closer together.

00:06:50.586 --> 00:06:54.172
In fact, we're an urban world,
where people live in urban areas.

00:06:54.196 --> 00:06:57.105
And at the same time,
we're growing more animals,

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:01.653
and those animals are contributing
food to humans as well.

00:07:01.677 --> 00:07:02.828
So what we see

00:07:02.852 --> 00:07:07.776
is that that animal-human interface
is becoming closer and closer together.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.679
And this intensive agriculture of animals

00:07:11.703 --> 00:07:14.497
and this intensive increase
in human populations

00:07:14.521 --> 00:07:16.537
living together on the same planet

00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:21.768
is really a melting pot
where outbreaks can occur and do occur.

00:07:21.792 --> 00:07:24.803
We will eventually have
more and more of these outbreaks.

00:07:24.827 --> 00:07:28.741
So an emerging infection today
is just a warning

00:07:28.765 --> 00:07:30.549
of what will happen in the future.

00:07:30.573 --> 00:07:31.778
We have to make sure

00:07:31.802 --> 00:07:34.855
that that technical
collaboration in the world

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:36.903
is there to work together

00:07:36.927 --> 00:07:40.276
to make sure that we can understand
these outbreaks when they occur

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.867
and rapidly provide the information
necessary to control them.

00:07:44.182 --> 00:07:46.431
[Is the worst behind us?]

00:07:46.455 --> 00:07:48.019
I can't predict with accuracy.

00:07:48.043 --> 00:07:51.066
So all I can say
is that we must all be prepared

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:52.950
for the worst-case scenario.

00:07:52.974 --> 00:07:54.617
And at the same time,

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:57.688
learn how we can protect ourselves
and protect others

00:07:57.712 --> 00:08:00.494
should we become a part of that epidemic.

00:08:00.518 --> 00:08:03.618
