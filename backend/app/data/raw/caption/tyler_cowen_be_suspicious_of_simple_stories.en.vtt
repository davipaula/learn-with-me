00:00:01.584 --> 00:00:03.519
In normal times,

00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:08.211
a blog written by an economist
might not get that much attention,

00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:12.638
but our next presenter's blog,
called Marginal Revolution,

00:00:12.638 --> 00:00:16.190
is quite popular, and he writes
a column for the New York Times,

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.239
called the Economic Scene,

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:23.780
here to explain the world to us in terms
of the Great Recession and beyond.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.423
It is Tyler Cowen.

00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:31.405
(Applause)

00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:39.161
I was told to come here
and tell you all stories,

00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:43.374
but what I'd like to do is instead
tell you why I'm suspicious of stories,

00:00:43.374 --> 00:00:45.723
why stories make me nervous.

00:00:45.723 --> 00:00:48.842
In fact, the more inspired
a story makes me feel,

00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:51.102
very often, the more nervous I get.

00:00:51.102 --> 00:00:52.232
(Laughter)

00:00:52.232 --> 00:00:55.022
So the best stories
are often the trickiest ones.

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:58.412
The good and bad things about stories
is that they are a kind of filter.

00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:01.323
They take a lot of information,
and they leave some of it out,

00:01:01.323 --> 00:01:03.067
and they keep some of it in.

00:01:03.067 --> 00:01:07.373
But the thing about this filter is
that it always leaves the same things in.

00:01:07.373 --> 00:01:10.494
You're always left
with the same few simple stories.

00:01:10.494 --> 00:01:12.890
There is the old saying
that just about every story

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.331
can be summed up
as "a stranger came to town."

00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:18.183
There is a book by Christopher Booker,

00:01:18.183 --> 00:01:21.077
where he claims there are really
just seven types of stories.

00:01:21.077 --> 00:01:23.747
There is monster, rags to riches, quest,

00:01:23.747 --> 00:01:27.736
voyage and return,
comedy, tragedy, rebirth.

00:01:27.736 --> 00:01:29.951
You don't have to agree
with that list exactly,

00:01:29.951 --> 00:01:33.281
but the point is this:
if you think in terms of stories,

00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:37.493
you're telling yourself the same things
over and over again.

00:01:37.493 --> 00:01:40.513
There was a study done,
we asked some people--

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.650
people were asked to describe their lives.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.331
When asked to describe their lives,

00:01:51.331 --> 00:01:54.578
what is interesting
is how few people said "mess".

00:01:54.578 --> 00:01:56.030
(Laughter)

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.072
It's probably the best answer,
I don't mean that in a bad way.

00:02:00.072 --> 00:02:02.485
"Mess" can be liberating,
"mess" can be empowering,

00:02:02.485 --> 00:02:06.133
"mess" can be a way
of drawing upon multiple strengths.

00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:10.501
But what people wanted to say was,
"My life is a journey."

00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:15.247
51% wanted to turn
his or her life into a story.

00:02:15.247 --> 00:02:20.085
11% said, "My life is a battle."
Again, that is a kind of story.

00:02:20.085 --> 00:02:24.189
8% said, "My life is a novel."
5% said, "My life is a play."

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:27.515
I don't think anyone said,
"My life is a reality TV show."

00:02:27.515 --> 00:02:28.675
(Laughter)

00:02:28.675 --> 00:02:32.370
But again, we're imposing order
on the mess we observe,

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.000
and it's taking the same patterns,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.066
and the thing is when something
is in the form of a story,

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:39.570
often, we remember it when we shouldn't.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.143
So how many of you know the story

00:02:41.143 --> 00:02:43.914
about George Washington
and the cherry tree?

00:02:43.914 --> 00:02:46.184
It's not obvious that is
exactly what happened.

00:02:46.184 --> 00:02:51.122
The story of Paul Revere, it's not obvious
that that is exactly the way it happened.

00:02:51.122 --> 00:02:54.852
So again, we should be
suspicious of stories.

00:02:54.852 --> 00:02:58.185
We're biologically programmed
to respond to them.

00:02:58.185 --> 00:03:01.127
They contain a lot of information.
They have social power.

00:03:01.127 --> 00:03:03.031
They connect us to other people.

00:03:03.031 --> 00:03:05.756
So they are like a candy that we're fed

00:03:05.756 --> 00:03:09.233
when we consume political information,
when we read novels.

00:03:09.233 --> 00:03:12.629
When we read non-fiction books,
we're really being fed stories.

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.012
Non-fiction is, in a sense,
the new fiction.

00:03:15.012 --> 00:03:17.837
The book may happen to say true things,

00:03:17.837 --> 00:03:22.267
but again, everything's taking
the same form of these stories.

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:26.166
So what are the problems
of relying too heavily on stories?

00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:28.063
You view your life like this

00:03:28.063 --> 00:03:31.413
instead of the mess
that it is or it ought to be.

00:03:31.413 --> 00:03:35.480
But more specifically,
I think of a few major problems

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.518
when we think too much
in terms of narrative.

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:41.172
First, narratives tend to be too simple,

00:03:41.172 --> 00:03:43.613
for the point of a narrative
is to strip it away,

00:03:43.613 --> 00:03:45.219
not just into 18 minutes,

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:48.671
but most narratives 
you can present in a sentence or two.

00:03:48.671 --> 00:03:50.532
When you strip away detail,

00:03:50.532 --> 00:03:54.160
you tend to tell stories
in terms of good versus evil,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.761
whether it's a story about your own life
or a story about politics.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:02.175
I know some things actually are
good versus evil, we all know this, right?

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:03.682
But I think, as a general rule,

00:04:03.682 --> 00:04:07.756
we're too inclined to tell
the good versus evil story.

00:04:07.756 --> 00:04:09.006
As a simple rule of thumb,

00:04:09.006 --> 00:04:13.256
just imagine that every time
you're telling a good versus evil story,

00:04:13.256 --> 00:04:17.432
you're basically lowering your IQ
by ten points or more.

00:04:17.432 --> 00:04:20.769
If you just adopt that
as a kind of inner mental habit,

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.071
it's, in my view, one way to get
a lot smarter pretty quickly.

00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:25.690
You don't have to read any books.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.745
Just imagine yourself pressing a button

00:04:27.745 --> 00:04:30.363
every time you tell
the good versus evil story,

00:04:30.363 --> 00:04:31.940
and by pressing that button,

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.510
you're lowering your IQ
by ten points or more.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.001
Another set of stories that are popular--

00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:40.368
if you know Oliver Stone's movies,
or Michael Moore's movies,

00:04:40.368 --> 00:04:43.970
you can't make a movie and say:
"It was all a big accident."

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.644
No, it has to be a conspiracy,
people plotting together,

00:04:48.644 --> 00:04:52.024
because in a story,
a story is about intention.

00:04:52.024 --> 00:04:56.285
A story is not about spontaneous order
or complex human institutions

00:04:56.285 --> 00:04:59.465
which are the product of human action,
but not of human design.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:03.552
No, a story is about evil people
plotting together.

00:05:03.552 --> 00:05:06.190
So when you hear stories about plots,

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.210
or even stories about good people
plotting things together,

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.334
just like when you're watching movies,

00:05:11.334 --> 00:05:14.073
this, again, is reason to be suspicious.

00:05:14.073 --> 00:05:16.084
As a good rule of thumb, if you're asking:

00:05:16.084 --> 00:05:19.453
"When I hear a story, when should I
be especially suspicious?"

00:05:19.453 --> 00:05:24.409
If you hear a story and you think:
"Wow, that would make a great movie!"

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:25.491
(Laughter)

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:29.349
That's when the "uh-oh" reaction
should pop in a bit more,

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.283
and you should start thinking in terms

00:05:31.283 --> 00:05:34.142
of how the whole thing
is maybe a bit of a mess.

00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:40.200
Another common story or storyline is
the claim that we "have to get tough".

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.251
You'll hear this in so many contexts.

00:05:43.251 --> 00:05:48.518
We have to get tough with the banks.
We had to get tough with the labor unions.

00:05:48.518 --> 00:05:50.654
We need to get tough
with some other country,

00:05:50.654 --> 00:05:54.473
some foreign dictator,
someone we're negotiating with.

00:05:54.473 --> 00:05:56.822
Again, the point is not
against getting tough.

00:05:56.822 --> 00:05:58.582
Sometimes we should get tough.

00:05:58.582 --> 00:06:01.804
That we got tough with the Nazis
was a good thing.

00:06:02.544 --> 00:06:07.898
But this is again a story we fall back
upon all too readily, all too quickly.

00:06:07.898 --> 00:06:10.195
When we don't really know
why something happened,

00:06:10.195 --> 00:06:13.904
we blame someone, and we say:
"We need to get tough with them!"

00:06:13.904 --> 00:06:16.488
As if it had never occurred
to your predecessor,

00:06:16.488 --> 00:06:18.706
this idea of getting tough.

00:06:18.706 --> 00:06:21.812
I view it usually
as a kind of mental laziness.

00:06:21.812 --> 00:06:25.094
It's a simple story you tell:
"We need to get tough,

00:06:25.094 --> 00:06:27.795
we needed to get tough,
we will have to get tough."

00:06:27.795 --> 00:06:30.690
Usually, that is a kind of warning signal.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.501
Another kind of problem with stories is

00:06:34.501 --> 00:06:37.923
you can only fit so many stories
into your mind at once,

00:06:37.923 --> 00:06:40.985
or in the course of a day,
or even over the course of a lifetime.

00:06:40.985 --> 00:06:43.851
So your stories are serving
too many purposes.

00:06:43.851 --> 00:06:46.744
For instance, just to get
out of bed in the morning,

00:06:46.744 --> 00:06:48.827
you tell yourself the story

00:06:48.827 --> 00:06:52.337
that your job is really important,
what you're doing is really important

00:06:52.337 --> 00:06:54.173
(Laughter)

00:06:54.173 --> 00:06:59.711
and maybe it is, but I tell myself
that story even when it's not.

00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:02.673
And you know what? That story works.

00:07:02.673 --> 00:07:04.327
It gets me out of bed.

00:07:04.327 --> 00:07:06.685
It's a kind of self-deception,

00:07:06.685 --> 00:07:09.292
but the problem comes
when I need to change that story.

00:07:09.292 --> 00:07:13.513
The whole point of the story is
that I grab onto it and I hold it,

00:07:13.513 --> 00:07:15.347
and it gets me out of bed.

00:07:15.347 --> 00:07:18.860
So when I'm really doing something
that is actually just a waste of time,

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.675
in my mess of a life,

00:07:20.675 --> 00:07:25.086
I'm too tied into my story
that got me out of bed,

00:07:25.086 --> 00:07:28.824
and ideally, I ought to have some
very complex story map in my mind,

00:07:28.824 --> 00:07:32.679
you know, with combinatorials
and a matrix of computation, and the like,

00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:34.585
but that is not how stories work.

00:07:34.585 --> 00:07:36.644
Stories in order to work 
have to be simple,

00:07:36.644 --> 00:07:40.354
easily grasped, easily told
to others, easily remembered.

00:07:40.354 --> 00:07:43.464
So stories will serve dual
and conflicting purposes,

00:07:43.464 --> 00:07:46.353
and very often they will lead us astray.

00:07:46.353 --> 00:07:49.194
I used to think I was
within the camp of economists,

00:07:49.194 --> 00:07:53.254
I was one of the good guys,
and I was allied with other good guys,

00:07:53.254 --> 00:07:56.383
and we were fighting
the ideas of the bad guys.

00:07:56.383 --> 00:07:57.995
I used to think that!

00:07:58.545 --> 00:08:00.661
And probably, I was wrong.

00:08:00.661 --> 00:08:02.669
Maybe sometimes, I'm one of the good guys,

00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:07.000
but on some issues, I finally realized:
"Hey, I wasn't one of the good guys."

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.422
I'm not sure I was the bad guy
in the sense of having evil intent,

00:08:10.422 --> 00:08:13.676
but it was very hard for me
to get away with that story.

00:08:15.676 --> 00:08:19.470
One interesting thing
about cognitive biases

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.954
is they are the subject
of so many books these days.

00:08:21.954 --> 00:08:26.467
There's the Nudge book,
the Sway book, the Blink book,

00:08:26.467 --> 00:08:28.225
like the one-title book,

00:08:28.225 --> 00:08:31.398
all about the ways in which we screw up.

00:08:31.398 --> 00:08:32.854
And there are so many ways,

00:08:32.854 --> 00:08:36.582
but what I find interesting
is that none of these books identify

00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:40.784
what, to me, is the single, central,
most important way we screw up,

00:08:40.784 --> 00:08:44.479
and that is that we tell
ourselves too many stories,

00:08:44.479 --> 00:08:47.204
or we are too easily seduced by stories.

00:08:47.204 --> 00:08:49.294
Why don't these books tell us that?

00:08:49.294 --> 00:08:52.362
It's because the books themselves
are all about stories.

00:08:52.922 --> 00:08:56.700
The more of these books you read,
you're learning about some of your biases,

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.637
but you're making some
of your other biases essentially worse.

00:09:00.637 --> 00:09:03.979
So the books themselves
are part of your cognitive bias.

00:09:04.539 --> 00:09:07.093
Often, people buy them
as a kind of talisman, like:

00:09:07.093 --> 00:09:10.960
"I bought this book. I won't be
'Predictably Irrational'."

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.620
(Laughter)

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.552
It's like people want to hear the worst,

00:09:15.552 --> 00:09:19.293
so psychologically, they can prepare
for it or defend against it.

00:09:19.293 --> 00:09:22.431
It's why there is
such a market for pessimism.

00:09:22.431 --> 00:09:25.334
But to think that by buying the book
gets you somewhere,

00:09:25.334 --> 00:09:27.252
that's maybe the bigger fallacy.

00:09:27.252 --> 00:09:30.514
It's just like the evidence that shows
that the most dangerous people

00:09:30.514 --> 00:09:33.273
are those who have been taught
some financial literacy.

00:09:33.273 --> 00:09:35.896
They're the ones who go out
and make the worst mistakes.

00:09:35.896 --> 00:09:38.760
It's the people who realize
they don't know anything at all,

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.769
that end up doing pretty well.

00:09:41.309 --> 00:09:42.872
A third problem with stories

00:09:42.872 --> 00:09:46.250
is that outsiders
manipulate us using stories,

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.656
and we all like to think advertising
only works on the other guy,

00:09:49.656 --> 00:09:54.200
but, of course, that's not how it is,
advertising works on all of us.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.513
So if you're too attached to stories,

00:09:56.513 --> 00:10:00.725
what will happen is people
selling products come along,

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:03.103
and they will bundle
their product with a story.

00:10:03.103 --> 00:10:04.750
You're like, "Hey, a free story!"

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.395
And you end up buying the product,

00:10:06.395 --> 00:10:08.585
because the product
and the story go together.

00:10:08.585 --> 00:10:09.623
(Laugther)

00:10:09.623 --> 00:10:11.562
If you think about how capitalism works,

00:10:11.562 --> 00:10:12.915
there is a bias here.

00:10:12.915 --> 00:10:15.649
Let's consider two kinds
of stories about cars.

00:10:16.139 --> 00:10:19.097
Story A is: "Buy this car,

00:10:19.097 --> 00:10:22.715
and you will have beautiful, romantic
partners and a fascinating life."

00:10:22.715 --> 00:10:24.225
(Laughter)

00:10:25.115 --> 00:10:26.345
There are a lot of people

00:10:26.345 --> 00:10:28.840
who have a financial incentive
to promote that story.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.938
But, say, the alternative story is:

00:10:31.388 --> 00:10:35.378
"You don't actually need a car
as nice as your income would indicate.

00:10:35.378 --> 00:10:38.819
What you usually do is look
at what your peers do and copy them.

00:10:38.819 --> 00:10:40.963
That is a good heuristic
for lots of problems,

00:10:40.963 --> 00:10:43.286
but when it comes to cars,
just buy a Toyota."

00:10:43.286 --> 00:10:45.466
(Laughter)

00:10:45.466 --> 00:10:47.207
Maybe Toyota has an incentive there,

00:10:47.207 --> 00:10:50.403
but even Toyota is making
more money off the luxury cars,

00:10:50.403 --> 00:10:52.340
and less money off the cheaper cars.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.020
So if you think which set of stories
you end up hearing,

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.500
you end up hearing the glamor stories,
the seductive stories,

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.777
and again I'm telling you,
don't trust them.

00:11:00.777 --> 00:11:04.998
There are people using
your love of stories to manipulate you.

00:11:06.048 --> 00:11:07.218
Pull back and say:

00:11:07.218 --> 00:11:08.316
"What are the messages,

00:11:08.316 --> 00:11:11.100
what are the stories
that no one has an incentive to tell?"

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:15.687
Start telling yourself those, and then see
if any of your decisions change.

00:11:15.687 --> 00:11:17.363
That is one simple way.

00:11:17.363 --> 00:11:20.824
You can never get out of the pattern
of thinking in terms of stories,

00:11:20.824 --> 00:11:24.460
but you can improve the extent
to which you think in stories,

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.524
and make some better decisions.

00:11:27.234 --> 00:11:30.388
So if I'm thinking about this talk,
I'm wondering, of course,

00:11:30.388 --> 00:11:33.015
what is it you take away from this talk?

00:11:33.015 --> 00:11:36.794
What story do you take away
from Tyler Cowen?

00:11:37.227 --> 00:11:40.403
One story you might be
like the story of the quest.

00:11:40.403 --> 00:11:42.828
"Tyler was a man on a quest.

00:11:42.828 --> 00:11:48.420
Tyler came here, and he told us
not to think so much in terms of stories."

00:11:49.135 --> 00:11:51.625
That would be a story
you could tell about this talk.

00:11:51.625 --> 00:11:53.522
(Laughter)

00:11:53.522 --> 00:11:55.504
It would fit a pretty well-known pattern.

00:11:55.504 --> 00:11:58.393
You might remember it.
You could tell it to other people.

00:11:58.393 --> 00:12:00.113
"This weird guy came, and he said,

00:12:00.113 --> 00:12:03.513
'Don't think in terms of stories.
Let me tell you what happened today!'"

00:12:03.513 --> 00:12:04.516
(Laughter)

00:12:04.516 --> 00:12:06.047
And you tell your story.

00:12:06.047 --> 00:12:07.688
(Laugther)

00:12:08.738 --> 00:12:13.060
Another possibility is
you might tell a story of rebirth.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:17.769
You might say, "I used to think
too much in terms of stories

00:12:17.769 --> 00:12:20.511
(Laughter)

00:12:20.511 --> 00:12:22.629
but then I heard Tyler Cowen

00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:23.595
(Laughter)

00:12:23.595 --> 00:12:26.869
and now I think less in terms of stories!"

00:12:26.869 --> 00:12:29.669
That too is a narrative you will remember,

00:12:29.669 --> 00:12:33.490
you can tell to other people,
and again, it may stick.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:38.223
You also could tell
a story of deep tragedy.

00:12:38.803 --> 00:12:40.738
"This guy Tyler Cowen came

00:12:40.738 --> 00:12:41.988
(Laughter)

00:12:41.988 --> 00:12:44.590
and he told us not to think
in terms of stories,

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.528
but all he could do was tell us stories

00:12:46.528 --> 00:12:47.594
(Laughter)

00:12:47.594 --> 00:12:51.555
about how other people think
too much in terms of stories."

00:12:51.555 --> 00:12:53.514
(Laughter)

00:12:54.171 --> 00:12:58.790
So, today, which is it?
Is it like quest, rebirth, tragedy?

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.733
Or maybe some combination of the three?

00:13:02.343 --> 00:13:05.121
I'm really not sure,
and I'm not here to tell you

00:13:05.121 --> 00:13:09.076
to burn your DVD player
and throw out your Tolstoy.

00:13:09.656 --> 00:13:13.948
To think in terms of stories
is fundamentally human.

00:13:13.948 --> 00:13:19.151
There is a Gabriel Garcia Marquez
memoir "Living to Tell the Tale"

00:13:19.721 --> 00:13:23.182
that we use memory in stories
to make sense of what we've done,

00:13:23.182 --> 00:13:27.675
to give meaning to our lives, to establish
connections with other people.

00:13:27.675 --> 00:13:31.745
None of this will go away,
should go away, or can go away.

00:13:31.745 --> 00:13:36.375
But again, as an economist,
I'm thinking about life on the margin,

00:13:37.055 --> 00:13:38.671
the extra decision.

00:13:38.671 --> 00:13:42.780
Should we think more in terms of stories,
or less in terms of stories?

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:46.912
When we hear stories,
should we be more suspicious?

00:13:46.912 --> 00:13:49.680
And what kind of stories
should we be suspicious of?

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:54.304
Again, I'm telling you it's the stories,
very often, that you like the most,

00:13:54.304 --> 00:13:58.164
that you find the most rewarding,
the most inspiring.

00:13:58.164 --> 00:14:01.865
The stories that don't focus
on opportunity cost,

00:14:01.865 --> 00:14:05.686
or the complex, unintended
consequences of human action,

00:14:05.686 --> 00:14:09.580
because that very often
does not make for a good story.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:14.230
So often a story is a story
of triumph, a story of struggle;

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:18.737
there are opposing forces,
which are either evil or ignorant;

00:14:18.737 --> 00:14:22.027
there is a person on a quest,
someone making a voyage,

00:14:22.027 --> 00:14:24.086
and a stranger coming to town.

00:14:24.766 --> 00:14:29.486
And those are your categories,
but don't let them make you too happy.

00:14:30.587 --> 00:14:31.936
(Laughter)

00:14:33.136 --> 00:14:34.911
As an alternative,

00:14:35.671 --> 00:14:39.000
at the margin
- again, no burning of Tolstoy -

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.956
but just be a little more messy.

00:14:42.456 --> 00:14:46.943
If I actually had to live those journeys,
and quests, and battles,

00:14:46.943 --> 00:14:48.980
that would be so oppressive to me!

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.717
It's like, my goodness,
can't I just have my life

00:14:51.717 --> 00:14:55.362
in its messy, ordinary 
- I hesitate to use the word - glory

00:14:55.362 --> 00:14:57.372
but that it's fun for me?

00:14:57.372 --> 00:14:59.725
Do I really have to follow
some kind of narrative?

00:14:59.725 --> 00:15:00.957
Can't I just live?

00:15:01.497 --> 00:15:04.543
So be more comfortable with messy.

00:15:05.173 --> 00:15:07.893
Be more comfortable with agnostic,

00:15:07.893 --> 00:15:10.588
and I mean this about the things
that make you feel good.

00:15:10.588 --> 00:15:13.361
It's so easy to pick out
a few areas to be agnostic in,

00:15:13.361 --> 00:15:14.714
and then feel good about it,

00:15:14.714 --> 00:15:18.545
like, "I am agnostic
about religion, or politics."

00:15:18.545 --> 00:15:22.757
It's a kind of portfolio move you make
to be more dogmatic elsewhere, right?

00:15:22.757 --> 00:15:24.937
(Laughter)

00:15:24.937 --> 00:15:26.007
Sometimes,

00:15:26.007 --> 00:15:29.553
the most intellectually trustworthy people
are the ones who pick one area,

00:15:29.553 --> 00:15:32.745
and they are totally dogmatic in that,
so pig-headedly unreasonable,

00:15:32.745 --> 00:15:35.395
that you think,
"How can they possibly believe that?"

00:15:35.395 --> 00:15:39.887
But it soaks up their stubbornness,

00:15:39.887 --> 00:15:42.617
and then, on other things,
they can be pretty open-minded.

00:15:43.057 --> 00:15:46.796
So don't fall into the trap of thinking
because you're agnostic on some things,

00:15:46.796 --> 00:15:48.809
that you're being fundamentally reasonable

00:15:48.809 --> 00:15:51.909
about your self-deception, your stories,
and your open-mindedness.

00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:54.056
(Laughter)

00:15:54.606 --> 00:15:58.473
[Think about] this idea of hovering,
of epistemological hovering,

00:15:58.473 --> 00:16:02.130
and messiness, and incompleteness,

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:04.766
[and how] not everything 
ties up into a neat bow,

00:16:04.766 --> 00:16:07.596
and you're really not on a journey here.

00:16:07.596 --> 00:16:10.463
You're here for some
messy reason or reasons,

00:16:10.463 --> 00:16:14.550
and maybe you don't know what it is,
and maybe I don't know what it is,

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.830
but anyway, I'm happy to be invited,
and thank you all for listening.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:18.828
(Laughter)

00:16:18.828 --> 00:16:20.539
(Applause)
