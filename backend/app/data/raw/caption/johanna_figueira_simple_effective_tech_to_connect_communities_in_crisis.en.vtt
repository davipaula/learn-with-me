00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:16.231
I'm an immigrant from Venezuela,

00:00:16.255 --> 00:00:19.246
and I've lived in the US for six years.

00:00:19.884 --> 00:00:22.782
If you ask me about my life
as an expatriate,

00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:24.658
I would say that I've been lucky.

00:00:24.682 --> 00:00:25.982
But it hasn't been easy.

00:00:26.536 --> 00:00:30.314
Growing up, I never thought
that I was going to leave my homeland.

00:00:30.338 --> 00:00:34.710
I participated in my first
student protest in 2007,

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:38.652
when the president shut down
one of the most important news networks.

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:41.959
I was getting my bachelor's degree
in communications,

00:00:41.983 --> 00:00:46.938
and that was the first time I realized
I couldn't take free speech for granted.

00:00:47.977 --> 00:00:51.445
We knew things were getting bad,
but we never saw what was coming:

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.772
an economic crisis,
infrastructure breaking down,

00:00:54.796 --> 00:00:57.254
citywide electrical blackouts,

00:00:57.278 --> 00:01:01.307
the decline of public health care
and shortage of medicines,

00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:03.532
disease outbreaks and starvation.

00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:07.729
I moved to Canada with my husband in 2013,

00:01:07.753 --> 00:01:11.745
and we always thought we'd move back home
when the crisis improved.

00:01:11.769 --> 00:01:13.305
But we never did.

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.367
Nearly all my childhood friends
have left the country,

00:01:16.391 --> 00:01:18.320
but my parents are still there.

00:01:18.843 --> 00:01:21.213
There have been moments
where I've called my mom,

00:01:21.237 --> 00:01:25.497
and I could hear people screaming
and crying in the background

00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:28.517
as teargas bombs exploded in the streets.

00:01:28.541 --> 00:01:32.769
And my mom, as if I couldn't
hear it, would always tell me,

00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:35.565
(Speaking Spanish)

00:01:35.589 --> 00:01:37.535
"We're fine, don't worry."

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:38.921
But of course, I worry.

00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:42.029
It's my parents, and I'm 4,000 miles away.

00:01:42.712 --> 00:01:46.773
Today, I'm just one of more than
four million Venezuelans

00:01:46.797 --> 00:01:48.473
who have left their home country.

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:52.193
A lot of my friends
are Venezuelan immigrants,

00:01:52.217 --> 00:01:53.754
and in the last few years,

00:01:53.778 --> 00:01:57.138
we've begun talking about
how we could make a difference

00:01:57.162 --> 00:01:59.157
when we live so far away.

00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:04.002
That is how Code for Venezuela
was born in 2019.

00:02:04.026 --> 00:02:07.424
It began with a hackathon,
because we are experts in tech,

00:02:07.448 --> 00:02:10.038
and we thought we could use
our tech skills

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:12.958
to create solutions
for people on the ground.

00:02:12.982 --> 00:02:17.950
But first, we needed to find some experts
actually living inside Venezuela

00:02:17.974 --> 00:02:19.365
to guide us.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.360
We'd see so many other hackathons

00:02:21.384 --> 00:02:25.517
that came up with wily, ambitious,
incredible technological solutions

00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:29.359
that sounded great in theory
but ultimately failed to work

00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:32.398
in the actual countries
they were intended to help.

00:02:33.071 --> 00:02:35.678
Many of us have been
living abroad for years,

00:02:35.702 --> 00:02:38.773
and we are detached
from the day-to-day problems

00:02:38.797 --> 00:02:40.898
that people are facing in Venezuela.

00:02:40.922 --> 00:02:44.445
So we turned to the experts
actually living inside of the country.

00:02:45.636 --> 00:02:47.882
For example, Julio Castro,

00:02:47.906 --> 00:02:51.682
a doctor and one of the leaders
of Médicos por la Salud.

00:02:52.545 --> 00:02:57.824
When the government stopped publishing
official health care data in 2015,

00:02:57.848 --> 00:03:01.982
Dr. Julio began collecting
information himself,

00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:05.477
using an informal but coordinated system

00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:07.679
of cell phone communications.

00:03:07.703 --> 00:03:12.326
They track available personnel,
medical supplies, mortality data,

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.904
disease outbreaks;

00:03:13.928 --> 00:03:15.510
compile it into a report;

00:03:15.534 --> 00:03:17.278
and then share that on Twitter.

00:03:17.302 --> 00:03:21.503
He became our go-to expert
on health care in Venezuela.

00:03:21.527 --> 00:03:22.791
Luis Carlos Díaz,

00:03:22.815 --> 00:03:27.263
a widely recognized journalist
who reports acts of censorship

00:03:27.287 --> 00:03:31.972
and human rights violations
suffered by the people of Venezuela,

00:03:31.996 --> 00:03:35.205
he helps us make sense
of what is happening there,

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:37.835
since the news is controlled
by the government.

00:03:38.581 --> 00:03:41.487
We call these people
our heroes on the ground.

00:03:41.511 --> 00:03:45.100
With their expert advice,
we came up with a series of challenges

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:47.182
for hackathon participants.

00:03:47.206 --> 00:03:50.473
In that first hackathon,
we had 300 participants

00:03:50.497 --> 00:03:51.822
from seven countries

00:03:51.846 --> 00:03:55.370
come up with 16 different
project submissions.

00:03:55.394 --> 00:03:57.971
We picked the projects
with the most potential

00:03:57.995 --> 00:04:00.833
and continued working on them
after the event.

00:04:00.857 --> 00:04:04.929
Today, I'll share two of our most
successful projects

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:08.126
to give you a taste of the impact
we are having so far.

00:04:08.524 --> 00:04:11.590
They're called MediTweet
and Blackout Tracker.

00:04:12.065 --> 00:04:14.549
MediTweet is an intelligent Twitter bot

00:04:14.573 --> 00:04:17.678
that helps Venezuelans
find the medicine they need.

00:04:18.178 --> 00:04:20.008
Right now in Venezuela,

00:04:20.032 --> 00:04:22.434
if you get sick and you go to a hospital,

00:04:22.458 --> 00:04:27.481
there is a good chance they won't have
the right medical supplies to treat you.

00:04:27.505 --> 00:04:29.344
The situation is so bad

00:04:29.368 --> 00:04:33.300
that patients often get
a "shopping list" from the doctor

00:04:33.324 --> 00:04:34.870
instead of a prescription.

00:04:36.028 --> 00:04:38.439
I live the need for this firsthand.

00:04:38.463 --> 00:04:42.922
My mom was diagnosed with cancer in 2015.

00:04:42.946 --> 00:04:45.024
She needed to have a lumbar puncture

00:04:45.048 --> 00:04:48.197
to get a final diagnosis
and treatment plan.

00:04:49.197 --> 00:04:51.603
But the needle for this procedure
wasn't available.

00:04:52.055 --> 00:04:54.542
I was in Venezuela at that time,

00:04:54.566 --> 00:04:58.490
and I was seeing my mom
getting worse in front of me every day.

00:04:59.751 --> 00:05:02.788
After looking everywhere,
we found the needle in a site

00:05:02.812 --> 00:05:05.348
that is like the eBay of Latin America.

00:05:05.886 --> 00:05:07.706
I met the seller in a local bakery,

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.425
and it was like buying
something on the black market.

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.280
My mom brought the needle to her doctor,
and he did the procedure.

00:05:14.304 --> 00:05:17.234
Without this, she could have died.

00:05:17.926 --> 00:05:19.859
But it's not just medical supplies,

00:05:19.883 --> 00:05:21.238
it's medicines, too.

00:05:21.262 --> 00:05:22.720
When she was first diagnosed,

00:05:22.744 --> 00:05:25.455
we bought her treatment
in a state pharmacy,

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.594
and it was, like, practically free.

00:05:27.618 --> 00:05:30.298
But then the state pharmacy ran out,

00:05:30.322 --> 00:05:33.838
and we still had six months
of treatment ahead.

00:05:34.576 --> 00:05:36.877
Six months of treatment ahead.

00:05:38.124 --> 00:05:41.822
We bought some medicines online
and the rest in Mexico.

00:05:41.846 --> 00:05:44.408
Now she's in her third year of remission,

00:05:44.432 --> 00:05:45.959
and every time that I call,

00:05:45.983 --> 00:05:48.826
she tells me, "I'm fine, don't worry."

00:05:49.711 --> 00:05:52.301
But not everyone can afford
to leave the country,

00:05:52.325 --> 00:05:55.025
and many aren't healthy enough to travel.

00:05:55.434 --> 00:05:57.526
That is why people turn to Twitter,

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.937
buying and selling medicines
using the hashtag #ServicioPublico,

00:06:01.961 --> 00:06:03.757
meaning "public service."

00:06:04.358 --> 00:06:08.800
Our Twitter bot scans Twitter
for the hashtag #ServicioPublico

00:06:08.824 --> 00:06:12.407
and connects users who are asking
for specific medicines

00:06:12.431 --> 00:06:16.163
with those who are selling
their private leftovers.

00:06:16.187 --> 00:06:19.491
We also pool the location data
of those Twitter users

00:06:19.515 --> 00:06:22.379
and use it for a visualization tool.

00:06:22.403 --> 00:06:26.322
It gives local organizations
like Médicos por la Salud

00:06:26.346 --> 00:06:29.180
a sense of where they have a shortage.

00:06:29.204 --> 00:06:32.307
We can also apply
machine learning algorithms

00:06:32.331 --> 00:06:34.718
to detect clusters of disease.

00:06:34.742 --> 00:06:36.628
If they've received humanitarian aid,

00:06:36.652 --> 00:06:39.482
this could help them
to make better decisions

00:06:39.506 --> 00:06:42.108
about the distributions of the supplies.

00:06:43.239 --> 00:06:46.484
Our second project,
is called Blackout Tracker.

00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:50.894
Venezuela is currently going through
an electricity crisis.

00:06:51.365 --> 00:06:55.173
Last year, Venezuela suffered
what some people consider

00:06:55.197 --> 00:06:58.534
the worst power failures
in Venezuelan history.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.151
I had two long days without
communication with my parents.

00:07:03.175 --> 00:07:06.133
Some cities experienced
blackouts every day.

00:07:06.157 --> 00:07:09.122
But you only know about this
on social media.

00:07:09.532 --> 00:07:12.647
The government won't report
blackouts on the news.

00:07:13.155 --> 00:07:15.090
When the power goes out,

00:07:15.114 --> 00:07:20.612
many Venezuelans, we quickly tweet out
the location with the hashtag #SinLuz,

00:07:20.636 --> 00:07:22.915
meaning "without electricity,"

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:25.394
before their phones ran out of battery,

00:07:25.418 --> 00:07:28.370
so people around the country
know what is happening.

00:07:29.245 --> 00:07:31.041
Like MediTweet,

00:07:31.065 --> 00:07:35.382
Blackout Tracker scans Twitter
for the hashtag #SinLuz

00:07:35.406 --> 00:07:39.402
and creates a map using
the location data of those users.

00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:40.946
You can quickly see

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.239
where the blackouts are happening today

00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:46.792
and how many blackouts
have happened over time.

00:07:47.887 --> 00:07:50.155
People want to know what is happening,

00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:51.654
and this is our answer.

00:07:51.678 --> 00:07:55.403
But it's also a way of holding
the government accountable.

00:07:55.427 --> 00:07:58.073
It's easy for them to deny
that the problem exists

00:07:58.097 --> 00:07:59.352
or make excuses,

00:07:59.376 --> 00:08:01.909
because there is no official data on it.

00:08:01.933 --> 00:08:06.056
Blackout Tracker shows how bad
the problem really is.

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.478
Now, some people in Silicon Valley
may look at these projects

00:08:10.502 --> 00:08:13.870
and say that there are no major
technological innovations.

00:08:13.894 --> 00:08:15.159
But that is the point.

00:08:15.583 --> 00:08:18.255
These projects are not insanely advanced,

00:08:18.279 --> 00:08:20.608
but it's what the people
of Venezuela need,

00:08:20.632 --> 00:08:22.704
and they can have a tremendous impact.

00:08:23.351 --> 00:08:27.626
Beyond these projects, perhaps
our most significant accomplishment

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:30.032
is that a movement has been created,

00:08:30.056 --> 00:08:33.653
one where people around the world
are coming together

00:08:33.677 --> 00:08:38.686
to use their professional skills to create
solutions for the people of Venezuela.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:40.807
And because we are partnering with locals,

00:08:40.831 --> 00:08:44.183
we are creating the solutions
that people want and need.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.541
What is so great about this

00:08:46.565 --> 00:08:49.022
is that we are using
our professional skills,

00:08:49.046 --> 00:08:51.360
so it comes easily and naturally.

00:08:51.384 --> 00:08:54.451
It's not that hard for us
to make a difference.

00:08:54.816 --> 00:08:56.939
If someone from San Francisco

00:08:56.963 --> 00:08:59.381
were to hire professionals
to create solutions

00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:01.676
like MediTweet or Blackout Tracker,

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.923
it would cost a small fortune.

00:09:03.947 --> 00:09:05.362
By donating our services,

00:09:05.386 --> 00:09:09.920
we are making a bigger impact
than if we were just to donate money.

00:09:10.761 --> 00:09:12.333
And you can do the same thing --

00:09:12.357 --> 00:09:13.864
not in Venezuela, necessarily,

00:09:13.888 --> 00:09:15.700
but in your own community.

00:09:16.415 --> 00:09:19.032
In a world that is more
connected than ever,

00:09:19.056 --> 00:09:24.909
we still see how specialized communities
can be living isolated or in silos.

00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:28.000
There are so many great ways to help,

00:09:28.024 --> 00:09:31.176
but I believe that you can use
your professional skills

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.657
to connect diverse communities
and create effective solutions

00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:36.595
through those relationships.

00:09:37.524 --> 00:09:41.674
Anyone with knowledge
and professional skills

00:09:41.698 --> 00:09:45.812
has a powerful force
to bring hope to a community.

00:09:46.248 --> 00:09:49.417
For us at Code for Venezuela,

00:09:49.441 --> 00:09:50.939
this is just the beginning.

00:09:50.963 --> 00:09:52.131
Thank you.

00:09:52.155 --> 00:09:54.670
(Applause)
