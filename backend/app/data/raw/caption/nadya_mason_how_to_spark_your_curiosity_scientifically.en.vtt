00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:15.809
A friend called me a few weeks ago

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:17.768
with bad news.

00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:20.170
She dropped her cell phone
into the toilet.

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:22.934
Anyone here done that before?

00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:24.643
(Laughter)

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:26.226
So it was a bad situation.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.601
You know, without getting into the details
of exactly how that happened

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:31.518
or how she got it out,

00:00:31.542 --> 00:00:34.018
let's just say it was a bad situation.

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:36.768
And she panicked because,
like for many of us,

00:00:36.792 --> 00:00:41.226
her phone is one of the most used
and essential tools in her life.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.268
But, on the other hand,
she had no idea how to fix it,

00:00:44.292 --> 00:00:47.583
because it's a completely
mysterious black box.

00:00:48.083 --> 00:00:50.750
So think about it: what would you do?

00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:54.809
What do you really understand
about how your phone works?

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:58.226
What are you willing to test or fix?

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.059
For most people, the answer is, nothing.

00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:03.893
In fact, one survey found

00:01:03.917 --> 00:01:07.101
that almost 80 percent
of smartphone users in this country

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:09.643
have never even replaced
their phone batteries,

00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:13.375
and 25 percent didn't even know
this was possible.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.643
Now, I'm an experimental physicist,

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:18.292
hence the toys.

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:24.184
I specialize in making new types
of nanoscale electronic devices

00:01:24.208 --> 00:01:27.542
to study their fundamental
quantum mechanical properties.

00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:33.726
But even I wouldn't know where to start
in terms of testing elements on my phone

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.226
if it broke.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.226
And phones are just one example
of the many devices that we depend upon

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.351
but can't test, take apart,
or even fully understand.

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:48.309
Cars, electronics, even toys
are now so complicated and advanced

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:50.917
that we're scared to open and fix them.

00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:54.559
So here's the problem:

00:01:54.583 --> 00:01:59.375
there's a disconnect between us
and the technology that we use.

00:02:00.708 --> 00:02:04.559
We're completely alienated
from the devices that we most depend upon,

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:07.417
which can make us feel helpless and empty.

00:02:08.125 --> 00:02:11.684
In fact, it's not surprising then
that one study found

00:02:11.708 --> 00:02:14.893
that we are now more afraid of technology

00:02:14.917 --> 00:02:17.518
than we are of death.

00:02:17.542 --> 00:02:21.393
(Laughter)

00:02:21.417 --> 00:02:26.101
But I think that we can
reconnect to our devices,

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:28.476
rehumanize them in a sense,

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.458
by doing more hands-on experiments.

00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:37.143
Why? Well, because an experiment
is a procedure to test a hypothesis,

00:02:37.167 --> 00:02:38.458
demonstrate a fact.

00:02:39.417 --> 00:02:42.393
It's the way that we use our senses,

00:02:42.417 --> 00:02:43.726
our hands,

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.393
to connect the world

00:02:45.417 --> 00:02:47.809
and figure out how it works.

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:50.809
And that's the connection
that we're missing.

00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:53.351
So let me give you an example.

00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:55.351
Here's an experiment that I did recently

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.518
to think about how a touchscreen works.

00:02:57.542 --> 00:02:59.434
It's just two metal plates,

00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:03.542
and I can put charge
on one of the plates from a battery.

00:03:07.917 --> 00:03:09.184
OK.

00:03:09.208 --> 00:03:12.351
And I can measure the charge separation
with this voltmeter here.

00:03:12.375 --> 00:03:14.143
Now -- let's make sure it's working.

00:03:14.167 --> 00:03:16.434
So when I wave my hand near the plates,

00:03:16.458 --> 00:03:18.684
you can see that the voltage changes

00:03:18.708 --> 00:03:21.250
just like the touchscreen
responds to my hand.

00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:25.518
But what is it about my hand?
Now I need to do more experiments.

00:03:25.542 --> 00:03:27.851
So I can, say, take a piece of wood

00:03:27.875 --> 00:03:31.434
and touch one of the plates
and see that not much happens,

00:03:31.458 --> 00:03:34.101
but if I take a piece of metal
and touch the plate,

00:03:34.125 --> 00:03:36.000
then the voltage changes dramatically.

00:03:36.958 --> 00:03:40.101
So now I can do further experiments
to see what the difference is

00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:41.684
between the wood and the metal,

00:03:41.708 --> 00:03:44.226
and I should find out
that the wood is not conducting

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.893
but the metal is conducting like my hand.

00:03:46.917 --> 00:03:49.643
And, you see, I build up my understanding.

00:03:49.667 --> 00:03:52.768
Like, now I can see why I can't use
a touchscreen with gloves,

00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:54.458
because gloves aren't conducting.

00:03:55.375 --> 00:04:00.476
But I've also broken down
some of the mystery behind the technology

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.601
and built up my agency,

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:07.333
my personal input and interactions
with the basis of my devices.

00:04:08.875 --> 00:04:12.351
But experimenting is a step
beyond just taking things apart.

00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:16.393
It's testing and doing
hands-on critical thinking.

00:04:16.417 --> 00:04:19.893
And it doesn't really matter whether
I'm testing how a touchscreen works

00:04:19.917 --> 00:04:23.393
or if I'm measuring how conducting
different types of materials are,

00:04:23.417 --> 00:04:26.893
or even if I'm just using my hands
to see how hard it is to break

00:04:26.917 --> 00:04:29.351
different thicknesses of materials.

00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:32.559
In all cases, I'm gaining control
and understanding

00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:34.792
of the basis of the things that I use.

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.601
And there's research behind this.

00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:39.518
For one, I'm using my hands,

00:04:39.542 --> 00:04:41.583
which seem to promote well-being.

00:04:42.417 --> 00:04:44.768
I'm also engaging in hands-on learning,

00:04:44.792 --> 00:04:48.768
which has been shown
to improve understanding and retention,

00:04:48.792 --> 00:04:51.333
and even activate
more parts of your brain.

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:55.518
So hands-on thinking through experiments

00:04:55.542 --> 00:04:57.768
connects our understanding,

00:04:57.792 --> 00:04:59.893
even our sense of vitality,

00:04:59.917 --> 00:05:02.833
to the physical world
and the things that we use.

00:05:03.833 --> 00:05:05.559
Looking things up on the internet

00:05:05.583 --> 00:05:07.208
does not have the same effect.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.268
Now, for me this focus on experiments

00:05:12.292 --> 00:05:13.976
is also personal.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.018
I didn't grow up doing experiments.

00:05:16.042 --> 00:05:17.934
I didn't know what a physicist did.

00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:21.184
I remember my sister had a chemistry set
that I always wanted to use

00:05:21.208 --> 00:05:22.542
but she never let me touch.

00:05:23.708 --> 00:05:26.351
I felt mentally disconnected
from the world

00:05:26.375 --> 00:05:28.393
and didn't know why.

00:05:28.417 --> 00:05:30.268
In fact, when I was nine years old,

00:05:30.292 --> 00:05:32.601
my grandmother called me a solipsist,

00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:34.393
which is something I had to look up.

00:05:34.417 --> 00:05:38.292
It means that you think
that yourself is all that exists.

00:05:39.875 --> 00:05:41.768
And at the time I was pretty offended,

00:05:41.792 --> 00:05:43.893
because whose grandmother calls them that?

00:05:43.917 --> 00:05:46.601
(Laughter)

00:05:46.625 --> 00:05:50.476
But I think that it was true.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.601
And it wasn't until years later,

00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:55.559
when I was in college
and studying basic physics,

00:05:55.583 --> 00:05:56.976
that I had a revelation

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.268
that the world,

00:05:58.292 --> 00:06:00.143
at least the physical world,

00:06:00.167 --> 00:06:02.601
could be tested and understood,

00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:05.059
that I started to gain
a completely different sense

00:06:05.083 --> 00:06:06.393
of how the world worked

00:06:06.417 --> 00:06:08.393
and what my place was in it.

00:06:08.417 --> 00:06:11.601
And then later,
when I was able my own testing

00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:13.434
and understanding through research,

00:06:13.458 --> 00:06:16.208
a big part of my connection
to the world was complete.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.309
Now, I know that not everyone is
an experimental physicist by profession,

00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:25.917
but I think that everyone could
be doing more hands-on experiments.

00:06:26.792 --> 00:06:28.601
And actually I think we sort of --

00:06:28.625 --> 00:06:30.917
I'll give you another example.

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:35.059
I was recently working
with some middle school students,

00:06:35.083 --> 00:06:37.059
helping them learn about magnetism,

00:06:37.083 --> 00:06:41.434
and I gave them
a Magna Doodle to take apart.

00:06:41.458 --> 00:06:43.542
Remember one of these things?

00:06:46.958 --> 00:06:50.809
So at first, none of them
wanted to touch it.

00:06:50.833 --> 00:06:53.601
They'd been told for so long
not to break things

00:06:53.625 --> 00:06:56.768
that they're accustomed
to just passive using.

00:06:56.792 --> 00:06:58.809
But then I started asking them questions.

00:06:58.833 --> 00:07:01.351
You know, how does it work?
What parts are magnetic?

00:07:01.375 --> 00:07:03.476
Can you make a hypothesis and test it?

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.809
But they still didn't want
to break it open.

00:07:05.833 --> 00:07:08.059
They wanted to take it
home with them, really.

00:07:08.083 --> 00:07:13.309
Until, one kid finally sliced it through
and found really cool stuff inside.

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:15.684
And so this is something
we can do here together.

00:07:15.708 --> 00:07:17.375
They're pretty easy to take apart.

00:07:20.958 --> 00:07:26.125
See, there's a magnet inside,
and I can just cut this open.

00:07:29.833 --> 00:07:31.851
Cut it open again, you can split it.

00:07:31.875 --> 00:07:35.393
OK, so when I do that --
I don't know if you can see this,

00:07:35.417 --> 00:07:39.226
but there is sort of -- there it is,
this oozy white stuff in here.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.934
Now you can see it on my finger.

00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:44.542
And when I drag the pen on it,

00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:51.393
you can see that these filaments
are attached to it.

00:07:51.417 --> 00:07:52.976
So the kids saw this,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.434
and at this point they're like,
this is really cool.

00:07:55.458 --> 00:07:56.726
They got excited.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:59.684
They all started ripping them open
and taking them apart

00:07:59.708 --> 00:08:02.559
and yelling out the things
that they discovered,

00:08:02.583 --> 00:08:06.351
how these magnetic filaments
connected to the magnetic pen

00:08:06.375 --> 00:08:07.684
and that's how it wrote.

00:08:07.708 --> 00:08:11.042
Or, how the oozy white stuff
kept things dispersed so it could write.

00:08:12.167 --> 00:08:13.851
And as they were leaving the room,

00:08:13.875 --> 00:08:15.893
two of them turned to me and said,

00:08:15.917 --> 00:08:17.476
"We loved that.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.976
Me and her are going home this weekend
to do more experiments."

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.583
(Laughter)

00:08:26.542 --> 00:08:29.226
Yeah, I know, the parents
in there are worried about it,

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.601
but it's a good thing!

00:08:31.625 --> 00:08:35.143
Experimenting is good, and actually
I found it extremely gratifying,

00:08:35.167 --> 00:08:40.309
and I think hopefully it was
very life-enriching for them.

00:08:40.333 --> 00:08:43.059
Because, even a basic magnet

00:08:43.083 --> 00:08:45.726
is something that we
can experiment with at home.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.559
They're both simple and complex
at the same time.

00:08:49.583 --> 00:08:51.268
For example, you can ask yourself,

00:08:51.292 --> 00:08:54.643
how can the same material
both attract and repel?

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:58.184
If I take a magnet,
is it useful if I can get one of them

00:08:58.208 --> 00:09:01.393
to rotate the other, for example?

00:09:01.417 --> 00:09:04.893
Or, you can take
this dollar bill over here,

00:09:04.917 --> 00:09:06.518
and I can take a set of magnets,

00:09:06.542 --> 00:09:10.976
and you can see that the dollar bill
gets lifted by the magnets.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.309
There's magnetic ink hidden in here
that prevents counterfeiting.

00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:18.684
Or, here I have some
crushed-up bran cereal. OK?

00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:21.601
And that's also magnetic. Right?

00:09:21.625 --> 00:09:24.101
That has iron in it.

00:09:24.125 --> 00:09:25.476
(Laughter)

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.768
And that can be good for you, right?

00:09:27.792 --> 00:09:29.809
OK, here's something else.

00:09:29.833 --> 00:09:31.684
This thing over here is not magnetic.

00:09:31.708 --> 00:09:34.684
I can't lift it up with the magnet.

00:09:34.708 --> 00:09:36.476
But now I'm going to make it cold.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.851
The same thing in here, cold,

00:09:38.875 --> 00:09:40.417
and when I make it cold,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.917
and put it on top of the magnet,

00:09:49.458 --> 00:09:50.851
so --

00:09:50.875 --> 00:09:52.143
(Applause)

00:09:52.167 --> 00:09:53.417
It's amazing.

00:09:57.792 --> 00:09:59.934
That's not magnetic,

00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:02.768
but somehow it's interacting
with a magnet.

00:10:02.792 --> 00:10:06.684
So clearly understanding this
is going to take many more experiments.

00:10:06.708 --> 00:10:10.018
In fact, this is something that I've spent
much of my career studying.

00:10:10.042 --> 00:10:11.500
It's called a superconductor.

00:10:12.083 --> 00:10:15.518
Now, superconductors can be complex,

00:10:15.542 --> 00:10:20.101
but even simple experiments
can connect us better to the world.

00:10:20.125 --> 00:10:24.976
So now if I tell you that flash memory
works by rotating small magnets,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.518
then you can imagine it. You've seen it.

00:10:27.542 --> 00:10:29.768
Or, if I say that MRI machines

00:10:29.792 --> 00:10:34.226
use magnetism to rotate
magnetic particles in your body,

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.101
you've seen it done.

00:10:36.125 --> 00:10:43.250
You've interacted with the technology
and understood the basis of these devices.

00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:51.768
Now, I know that it's hard
to add more things to our lives,

00:10:51.792 --> 00:10:54.143
especially experiments.

00:10:54.167 --> 00:10:57.101
But I think that
the challenge is worth it.

00:10:57.125 --> 00:11:01.226
Think about how something works,
then take it apart to test it.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:05.375
Manipulate something and prove
some physical principle to yourself.

00:11:06.292 --> 00:11:09.333
Put the human back in the technology.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.143
You'll be surprised at
the connections that you make.

00:11:13.167 --> 00:11:15.143
Thank you.

00:11:15.167 --> 00:11:17.333
(Applause)
