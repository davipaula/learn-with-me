00:00:12.782 --> 00:00:16.057
I'm in the business
of safeguarding secrets,

00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:18.253
and this includes your secrets.

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:21.340
Cryptographers are
the first line of defense

00:00:21.364 --> 00:00:24.946
in an ongoing war that's been
raging for centuries:

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.233
a war between code makers

00:00:27.257 --> 00:00:28.509
and code breakers.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.124
And this is a war on information.

00:00:32.227 --> 00:00:35.711
The modern battlefield
for information is digital.

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:37.897
And it wages across your phones,

00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:39.097
your computers

00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:40.290
and the internet.

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:46.278
Our job is to create systems that scramble
your emails and credit card numbers,

00:00:46.302 --> 00:00:48.561
your phone calls and text messages --

00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:50.777
and that includes those saucy selfies --

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:52.023
(Laughter)

00:00:52.047 --> 00:00:54.800
so that all of this information
can only be descrambled

00:00:54.824 --> 00:00:56.945
by the recipient that it's intended for.

00:00:58.017 --> 00:01:00.330
Now, until very recently,

00:01:00.354 --> 00:01:02.909
we thought we'd won this war for good.

00:01:03.694 --> 00:01:06.639
Right now, each of your smartphones
is using encryption

00:01:06.663 --> 00:01:10.363
that we thought was unbreakable
and that was going to remain that way.

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:13.594
We were wrong,

00:01:13.618 --> 00:01:16.004
because quantum computers are coming,

00:01:16.028 --> 00:01:18.818
and they're going to change
the game completely.

00:01:20.445 --> 00:01:22.901
Throughout history,
cryptography and code-breaking

00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:24.995
has always been this game
of cat and mouse.

00:01:25.598 --> 00:01:27.275
Back in the 1500s,

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.478
Queen Mary of the Scots thought
she was sending encrypted letters

00:01:30.502 --> 00:01:32.479
that only her soldiers could decipher.

00:01:33.074 --> 00:01:35.120
But Queen Elizabeth of England,

00:01:35.144 --> 00:01:37.544
she had code breakers
that were all over it.

00:01:38.116 --> 00:01:40.121
They decrypted Mary's letters,

00:01:40.145 --> 00:01:43.318
saw that she was attempting
to assassinate Elizabeth

00:01:43.342 --> 00:01:45.773
and, subsequently,
they chopped Mary's head off.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.081
A few centuries later, in World War II,

00:01:50.987 --> 00:01:53.871
the Nazis communicated
using the Engima code,

00:01:53.895 --> 00:01:57.536
a much more complicated encryption scheme
that they thought was unbreakable.

00:01:58.274 --> 00:02:00.204
But then good old Alan Turing,

00:02:00.228 --> 00:02:03.263
the same guy who invented
what we now call the modern computer,

00:02:03.287 --> 00:02:05.902
he built a machine and used it
to break Enigma.

00:02:06.545 --> 00:02:08.150
He deciphered the German messages

00:02:08.174 --> 00:02:10.889
and helped to bring Hitler
and his Third Reich to a halt.

00:02:11.772 --> 00:02:14.331
And so the story has gone
throughout the centuries.

00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:17.323
Cryptographers improve their encryption,

00:02:17.347 --> 00:02:20.485
and then code breakers fight back
and they find a way to break it.

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:24.356
This war's gone back and forth,
and it's been pretty neck and neck.

00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:28.248
That was until the 1970s,

00:02:28.272 --> 00:02:30.932
when some cryptographers
made a huge breakthrough.

00:02:31.781 --> 00:02:35.342
They discovered an extremely
powerful way to do encryption

00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:37.118
called "public-key cryptography."

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:42.114
Unlike all of the prior methods used
throughout history, it doesn't require

00:02:42.138 --> 00:02:45.745
that the two parties that want to send
each other confidential information

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.828
have exchanged the secret key beforehand.

00:02:48.602 --> 00:02:52.714
The magic of public-key cryptography
is that it allows us to connect securely

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:54.282
with anyone in the world,

00:02:55.481 --> 00:02:58.350
whether we've exchanged
data before or not,

00:02:58.374 --> 00:03:02.036
and to do it so fast that you and I
don't even realize it's happening.

00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:06.239
Whether you're texting your mate
to catch up for a beer,

00:03:06.263 --> 00:03:10.510
or you're a bank that's transferring
billions of dollars to another bank,

00:03:10.534 --> 00:03:13.585
modern encryption enables us
to send data that can be secured

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.630
in a matter of milliseconds.

00:03:17.502 --> 00:03:20.384
The brilliant idea that makes
this magic possible,

00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:22.935
it relies on hard mathematical problems.

00:03:23.623 --> 00:03:27.457
Cryptographers are deeply interested
in things that calculators can't do.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.651
For example, calculators can multiply
any two numbers you like,

00:03:32.675 --> 00:03:34.361
no matter how big the size.

00:03:35.175 --> 00:03:37.116
But going back the other way --

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.358
starting with the product and then asking,

00:03:39.382 --> 00:03:41.747
"Which two numbers multiply
to give this one?" --

00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:44.152
that's actually a really hard problem.

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:49.949
If I asked you to find which two-digit
numbers multiply to give 851,

00:03:51.051 --> 00:03:52.243
even with a calculator,

00:03:52.267 --> 00:03:55.374
most people in this room would have
a hard time finding the answer

00:03:55.398 --> 00:03:57.314
by the time I'm finished with this talk.

00:03:57.338 --> 00:03:59.999
And if I make the numbers a little larger,

00:04:00.023 --> 00:04:03.680
then there's no calculator on earth
that can do this.

00:04:03.704 --> 00:04:06.587
In fact, even the world's
fastest supercomputer

00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:09.101
would take longer
than the life age of the universe

00:04:09.125 --> 00:04:11.997
to find the two numbers
that multiply to give this one.

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:16.370
And this problem,
called "integer factorization,"

00:04:16.394 --> 00:04:20.020
is exactly what each of your smartphones
and laptops is using right now

00:04:20.044 --> 00:04:21.578
to keep your data secure.

00:04:22.254 --> 00:04:24.671
This is the basis of modern encryption.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:30.476
And the fact that all the computing power
on the planet combined can't solve it,

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.373
that's the reason we cryptographers
thought we'd found a way

00:04:33.397 --> 00:04:35.655
to stay ahead of the code
breakers for good.

00:04:37.131 --> 00:04:38.783
Perhaps we got a little cocky

00:04:39.902 --> 00:04:42.248
because just when we thought
the war was won,

00:04:42.272 --> 00:04:45.210
a bunch of 20th-century physicists
came to the party,

00:04:45.234 --> 00:04:47.913
and they revealed
that the laws of the universe,

00:04:47.937 --> 00:04:50.532
the same laws that modern
cryptography was built upon,

00:04:51.422 --> 00:04:53.237
they aren't as we thought they were.

00:04:54.205 --> 00:04:57.716
We thought that one object couldn't be
in two places at the same time.

00:04:58.262 --> 00:04:59.803
It's not the case.

00:04:59.827 --> 00:05:03.539
We thought nothing can possibly spin
clockwise and anticlockwise

00:05:03.563 --> 00:05:04.848
simultaneously.

00:05:05.265 --> 00:05:06.652
But that's incorrect.

00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:10.883
And we thought that two objects
on opposite sides of the universe,

00:05:10.907 --> 00:05:13.208
light years away from each other,

00:05:13.232 --> 00:05:16.798
they can't possibly influence
one another instantaneously.

00:05:17.932 --> 00:05:19.179
We were wrong again.

00:05:20.403 --> 00:05:22.612
And isn't that always the way
life seems to go?

00:05:22.636 --> 00:05:26.032
Just when you think you've got
everything covered, your ducks in a row,

00:05:26.056 --> 00:05:27.611
a bunch of physicists come along

00:05:27.635 --> 00:05:31.327
and reveal that the fundamental laws
of the universe are completely different

00:05:31.351 --> 00:05:32.512
to what you thought?

00:05:32.536 --> 00:05:33.594
(Laughter)

00:05:33.618 --> 00:05:34.974
And it screws everything up.

00:05:34.998 --> 00:05:39.524
See, in the teeny tiny subatomic realm,

00:05:39.548 --> 00:05:42.560
at the level of electrons and protons,

00:05:42.584 --> 00:05:44.406
the classical laws of physics,

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.270
the ones that we all know and love,

00:05:46.294 --> 00:05:47.532
they go out the window.

00:05:48.023 --> 00:05:50.834
And it's here that the laws
of quantum mechanics kick in.

00:05:51.688 --> 00:05:52.874
In quantum mechanics,

00:05:52.898 --> 00:05:57.376
an electron can be spinning clockwise
and anticlockwise at the same time,

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.964
and a proton can be in two places at once.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.063
It sounds like science fiction,

00:06:04.087 --> 00:06:08.282
but that's only because
the crazy quantum nature of our universe,

00:06:08.306 --> 00:06:09.977
it hides itself from us.

00:06:10.884 --> 00:06:14.176
And it stayed hidden from us
until the 20th century.

00:06:15.494 --> 00:06:19.263
But now that we've seen it,
the whole world is in an arms race

00:06:19.287 --> 00:06:21.563
to try to build a quantum computer --

00:06:22.455 --> 00:06:26.794
a computer that can harness the power
of this weird and wacky quantum behavior.

00:06:28.375 --> 00:06:30.831
These things are so revolutionary

00:06:30.855 --> 00:06:32.621
and so powerful

00:06:32.645 --> 00:06:34.998
that they'll make today's
fastest supercomputer

00:06:35.022 --> 00:06:37.102
look useless in comparison.

00:06:37.868 --> 00:06:40.886
In fact, for certain problems
that are of great interest to us,

00:06:41.633 --> 00:06:44.244
today's fastest supercomputer
is closer to an abacus

00:06:44.268 --> 00:06:45.943
than to a quantum computer.

00:06:45.967 --> 00:06:49.503
That's right, I'm talking about
those little wooden things with the beads.

00:06:50.477 --> 00:06:54.745
Quantum computers can simulate
chemical and biological processes

00:06:54.769 --> 00:06:57.675
that are far beyond the reach
of our classical computers.

00:06:58.812 --> 00:07:04.403
And as such, they promise to help us solve
some of our planet's biggest problems.

00:07:05.492 --> 00:07:07.764
They're going to help us
combat global hunger;

00:07:09.074 --> 00:07:11.391
to tackle climate change;

00:07:11.415 --> 00:07:15.375
to find cures for diseases and pandemics
for which we've so far been unsuccessful;

00:07:16.213 --> 00:07:19.122
to create superhuman
artificial intelligence;

00:07:20.034 --> 00:07:22.938
and perhaps even more important
than all of those things,

00:07:22.962 --> 00:07:26.688
they're going to help us understand
the very nature of our universe.

00:07:28.376 --> 00:07:30.590
But with this incredible potential

00:07:31.788 --> 00:07:33.419
comes an incredible risk.

00:07:34.785 --> 00:07:37.169
Remember those big numbers
I talked about earlier?

00:07:38.152 --> 00:07:40.251
I'm not talking about 851.

00:07:40.275 --> 00:07:42.456
In fact, if anyone in here
has been distracted

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.919
trying to find those factors,

00:07:43.943 --> 00:07:47.497
I'm going to put you out of your misery
and tell you that it's 23 times 37.

00:07:47.521 --> 00:07:48.715
(Laughter)

00:07:48.739 --> 00:07:51.474
I'm talking about the much
bigger number that followed it.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.800
While today's fastest supercomputer
couldn't find those factors

00:07:55.824 --> 00:07:58.157
in the life age of the universe,

00:07:58.181 --> 00:08:01.061
a quantum computer
could easily factorize numbers

00:08:01.085 --> 00:08:02.652
way, way bigger than that one.

00:08:03.882 --> 00:08:07.292
Quantum computers will break
all of the encryption currently used

00:08:07.316 --> 00:08:09.294
to protect you and I from hackers.

00:08:09.318 --> 00:08:10.745
And they'll do it easily.

00:08:12.539 --> 00:08:13.872
Let me put it this way:

00:08:13.896 --> 00:08:15.666
if quantum computing was a spear,

00:08:16.666 --> 00:08:18.201
then modern encryption,

00:08:18.225 --> 00:08:21.598
the same unbreakable system
that's protected us for decades,

00:08:21.622 --> 00:08:24.280
it would be like a shield
made of tissue paper.

00:08:25.578 --> 00:08:29.566
Anyone with access to a quantum computer
will have the master key

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.278
to unlock anything they like
in our digital world.

00:08:33.293 --> 00:08:35.105
They could steal money from banks

00:08:35.129 --> 00:08:36.560
and control economies.

00:08:37.303 --> 00:08:40.200
They could power off hospitals
or launch nukes.

00:08:40.224 --> 00:08:43.561
Or they could just sit back
and watch all of us on our webcams

00:08:43.585 --> 00:08:45.943
without any of us knowing
that this is happening.

00:08:49.314 --> 00:08:53.273
Now, the fundamental unit of information
on all of the computers we're used to,

00:08:53.297 --> 00:08:54.802
like this one,

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:56.168
it's called a "bit."

00:08:56.651 --> 00:08:58.874
A single bit can be one of two states:

00:08:58.898 --> 00:09:01.157
it can be a zero or it can be a one.

00:09:02.157 --> 00:09:04.985
When I FaceTime my mum
from the other side of the world --

00:09:05.746 --> 00:09:08.232
and she's going to kill
me for having this slide --

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:09.651
(Laughter)

00:09:09.675 --> 00:09:13.409
we're actually just sending each other
long sequences of zeroes and ones

00:09:13.433 --> 00:09:16.635
that bounce from computer to computer,
from satellite to satellite,

00:09:16.659 --> 00:09:18.805
transmitting our data at a rapid pace.

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:20.832
Bits are certainly very useful.

00:09:20.856 --> 00:09:23.552
In fact, anything
we currently do with technology

00:09:23.576 --> 00:09:25.638
is indebted to the usefulness of bits.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.229
But we're starting to realize

00:09:28.253 --> 00:09:32.768
that bits are really poor at simulating
complex molecules and particles.

00:09:33.394 --> 00:09:35.370
And this is because, in some sense,

00:09:35.394 --> 00:09:38.479
subatomic processes can be doing
two or more opposing things

00:09:38.503 --> 00:09:39.691
at the same time

00:09:39.715 --> 00:09:42.701
as they follow these bizarre rules
of quantum mechanics.

00:09:43.232 --> 00:09:44.776
So, late last century,

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.017
some really brainy physicists
had this ingenious idea:

00:09:48.041 --> 00:09:50.042
to instead build computers
that are founded

00:09:50.066 --> 00:09:52.156
on the principles of quantum mechanics.

00:09:54.557 --> 00:09:57.776
Now, the fundamental unit of information
of a quantum computer,

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.048
it's called a "qubit."

00:09:59.582 --> 00:10:01.382
It stands for "quantum bit."

00:10:02.986 --> 00:10:06.243
Instead of having just two states,
like zero or one,

00:10:06.267 --> 00:10:09.156
a qubit can be an infinite
number of states.

00:10:09.849 --> 00:10:13.515
And this corresponds to it being
some combination of both zero and one

00:10:13.539 --> 00:10:15.326
at the same time,

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.539
a phenomenon that we call "superposition."

00:10:18.569 --> 00:10:21.274
And when we have two qubits
in superposition,

00:10:21.298 --> 00:10:23.680
we're actually working across
all four combinations

00:10:23.704 --> 00:10:26.214
of zero-zero, zero-one,
one-zero and one-one.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.286
With three qubits,

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.551
we're working in superposition
across eight combinations,

00:10:31.575 --> 00:10:32.727
and so on.

00:10:33.294 --> 00:10:37.244
Each time we add a single qubit,
we double the number of combinations

00:10:37.268 --> 00:10:40.870
that we can work with in superposition

00:10:40.894 --> 00:10:42.073
at the same time.

00:10:43.005 --> 00:10:45.634
And so when we scale up
to work with many qubits,

00:10:45.658 --> 00:10:49.280
we can work with an exponential
number of combinations

00:10:49.304 --> 00:10:50.623
at the same time.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.075
And this just hints at where the power
of quantum computing is coming from.

00:10:56.964 --> 00:10:58.291
Now, in modern encryption,

00:10:59.429 --> 00:11:03.357
our secret keys, like the two factors
of that larger number,

00:11:03.381 --> 00:11:05.658
they're just long sequences
of zeroes and ones.

00:11:06.539 --> 00:11:07.783
To find them,

00:11:07.807 --> 00:11:12.251
a classical computer must go through
every single combination,

00:11:12.275 --> 00:11:13.426
one after the other,

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.529
until it finds the one that works
and breaks our encryption.

00:11:18.191 --> 00:11:19.739
But on a quantum computer,

00:11:20.779 --> 00:11:23.972
with enough qubits in superposition,

00:11:25.001 --> 00:11:29.332
information can be extracted
from all combinations at the same time.

00:11:30.912 --> 00:11:32.166
In very few steps,

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:36.164
a quantum computer can brush aside
all of the incorrect combinations,

00:11:36.188 --> 00:11:37.601
home in on the correct one

00:11:37.625 --> 00:11:39.686
and then unlock our treasured secrets.

00:11:44.215 --> 00:11:46.781
Now, at the crazy quantum level,

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.522
something truly incredible
is happening here.

00:11:52.625 --> 00:11:56.299
The conventional wisdom
held by many leading physicists --

00:11:56.323 --> 00:11:58.942
and you've got to stay
with me on this one --

00:11:58.966 --> 00:12:03.389
is that each combination is actually
examined by its very own quantum computer

00:12:03.413 --> 00:12:05.962
inside its very own parallel universe.

00:12:07.303 --> 00:12:11.204
Each of these combinations,
they add up like waves in a pool of water.

00:12:12.085 --> 00:12:14.071
The combinations that are wrong,

00:12:14.095 --> 00:12:16.073
they cancel each other out.

00:12:16.097 --> 00:12:17.857
And the combinations that are right,

00:12:17.881 --> 00:12:19.740
they reinforce and amplify each other.

00:12:20.241 --> 00:12:22.906
So at the end of the quantum
computing program,

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.747
all that's left is the correct answer,

00:12:25.771 --> 00:12:28.324
that we can then observe
here in this universe.

00:12:29.575 --> 00:12:32.711
Now, if that doesn't make
complete sense to you, don't stress.

00:12:32.735 --> 00:12:33.783
(Laughter)

00:12:33.807 --> 00:12:35.030
You're in good company.

00:12:36.205 --> 00:12:39.371
Niels Bohr, one of
the pioneers of this field,

00:12:39.395 --> 00:12:42.402
he once said that anyone
who could contemplate quantum mechanics

00:12:42.426 --> 00:12:44.789
without being profoundly shocked,

00:12:44.813 --> 00:12:46.269
they haven't understood it.

00:12:46.293 --> 00:12:47.720
(Laughter)

00:12:47.744 --> 00:12:49.899
But you get an idea
of what we're up against,

00:12:49.923 --> 00:12:51.985
and why it's now up to us cryptographers

00:12:52.009 --> 00:12:53.372
to really step it up.

00:12:54.674 --> 00:12:56.763
And we have to do it fast,

00:12:56.787 --> 00:12:58.819
because quantum computers,

00:12:58.843 --> 00:13:01.866
they already exist in labs
all over the world.

00:13:03.248 --> 00:13:05.145
Fortunately, at this minute,

00:13:05.169 --> 00:13:07.839
they only exist
at a relatively small scale,

00:13:07.863 --> 00:13:10.928
still too small to break
our much larger cryptographic keys.

00:13:12.127 --> 00:13:13.811
But we might not be safe for long.

00:13:14.968 --> 00:13:17.464
Some folks believe that secret
government agencies

00:13:17.488 --> 00:13:19.401
have already built a big enough one,

00:13:19.425 --> 00:13:21.398
and they just haven't told anyone yet.

00:13:21.961 --> 00:13:24.390
Some pundits say
they're more like 10 years off.

00:13:24.414 --> 00:13:26.274
Some people say it's more like 30.

00:13:27.163 --> 00:13:30.020
You might think that
if quantum computers are 10 years away,

00:13:30.044 --> 00:13:33.108
surely that's enough time
for us cryptographers to figure it out

00:13:33.132 --> 00:13:34.826
and to secure the internet in time.

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:36.737
But unfortunately, it's not that easy.

00:13:37.521 --> 00:13:39.709
Even if we ignore
the many years that it takes

00:13:39.733 --> 00:13:43.399
to standardize and deploy and then
roll out new encryption technology,

00:13:43.423 --> 00:13:45.751
in some ways we may already be too late.

00:13:47.407 --> 00:13:50.579
Smart digital criminals
and government agencies

00:13:50.603 --> 00:13:54.882
may already be storing
our most sensitive encrypted data

00:13:54.906 --> 00:13:57.499
in anticipation for
the quantum future ahead.

00:13:59.069 --> 00:14:00.807
The messages of foreign leaders,

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.455
of war generals

00:14:04.653 --> 00:14:06.815
or of individuals who question power,

00:14:07.936 --> 00:14:09.486
they're encrypted for now.

00:14:10.487 --> 00:14:12.088
But as soon as the day comes

00:14:12.112 --> 00:14:14.888
that someone gets their hands
on a quantum computer,

00:14:14.912 --> 00:14:18.038
they can retroactively break
anything from the past.

00:14:19.078 --> 00:14:21.108
In certain government
and financial sectors

00:14:21.132 --> 00:14:22.535
or in military organizations,

00:14:22.559 --> 00:14:25.633
sensitive data has got to remain
classified for 25 years.

00:14:26.273 --> 00:14:29.453
So if a quantum computer
really will exist in 10 years,

00:14:29.477 --> 00:14:31.767
then these guys are already
15 years too late

00:14:31.791 --> 00:14:33.501
to quantum-proof their encryption.

00:14:34.858 --> 00:14:36.834
So while many scientists around the world

00:14:36.858 --> 00:14:39.761
are racing to try to build
a quantum computer,

00:14:39.785 --> 00:14:43.235
us cryptographers are urgently
looking to reinvent encryption

00:14:43.259 --> 00:14:45.461
to protect us long before that day comes.

00:14:46.718 --> 00:14:49.692
We're looking for new,
hard mathematical problems.

00:14:50.435 --> 00:14:53.446
We're looking for problems that,
just like factorization,

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.479
can be used on our smartphones
and on our laptops today.

00:14:57.596 --> 00:15:01.971
But unlike factorization,
we need these problems to be so hard

00:15:01.995 --> 00:15:04.841
that they're even unbreakable
with a quantum computer.

00:15:06.366 --> 00:15:09.972
In recent years, we've been digging around
a much wider realm of mathematics

00:15:09.996 --> 00:15:11.522
to look for such problems.

00:15:12.205 --> 00:15:14.176
We've been looking at numbers and objects

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.368
that are far more exotic
and far more abstract

00:15:16.392 --> 00:15:18.348
than the ones that you and I are used to,

00:15:18.372 --> 00:15:19.969
like the ones on our calculators.

00:15:19.993 --> 00:15:22.373
And we believe we've found
some geometric problems

00:15:22.397 --> 00:15:23.796
that just might do the trick.

00:15:24.383 --> 00:15:27.446
Now, unlike those two-
and three-dimensional geometric problems

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:31.169
that we used to have to try to solve
with pen and graph paper in high school,

00:15:31.193 --> 00:15:35.422
most of these problems are defined
in well over 500 dimensions.

00:15:36.453 --> 00:15:40.209
So not only are they a little hard
to depict and solve on graph paper,

00:15:40.233 --> 00:15:43.705
but we believe they're even
out of the reach of a quantum computer.

00:15:45.392 --> 00:15:47.089
So though it's early days,

00:15:47.113 --> 00:15:51.618
it's here that we are putting our hope
as we try to secure our digital world

00:15:51.642 --> 00:15:53.612
moving into its quantum future.

00:15:55.171 --> 00:15:57.024
Just like all of the other scientists,

00:15:57.048 --> 00:15:59.211
we cryptographers are tremendously excited

00:15:59.235 --> 00:16:03.092
at the potential of living in a world
alongside quantum computers.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:06.992
They could be such a force for good.

00:16:09.508 --> 00:16:13.756
But no matter what
technological future we live in,

00:16:16.867 --> 00:16:21.723
our secrets will always be
a part of our humanity.

00:16:22.637 --> 00:16:24.871
And that is worth protecting.

00:16:25.559 --> 00:16:26.713
Thanks.

00:16:26.737 --> 00:16:29.843
(Applause)
