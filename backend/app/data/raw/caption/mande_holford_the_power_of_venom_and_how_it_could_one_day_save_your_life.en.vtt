00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.159
How does a sea snail catch a fish?

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:18.706
I mean, it's a snail, so it's slow,

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.645
and the fish is not.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.149
But yet, this happens.

00:00:24.817 --> 00:00:27.419
Hidden under the sand is a cone snail.

00:00:27.443 --> 00:00:30.230
And that orange thing you see
is kind of like a tongue.

00:00:30.254 --> 00:00:32.071
We call it a proboscis.

00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:36.975
It uses that to track and subdue
this unsuspecting fish.

00:00:38.046 --> 00:00:40.022
In this predator-prey interaction,

00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:43.395
these are clearly not
your garden variety escargots.

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:46.482
These are assassins of the sea.

00:00:47.102 --> 00:00:50.045
And their weapon of choice is venom.

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:54.332
Venom, like the venom you find
in venomous snakes and scorpions,

00:00:54.356 --> 00:00:58.935
these sea snails, they use their venom
to subdue fish, worms

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:00.240
and other snails.

00:01:00.264 --> 00:01:01.716
And the venom of these snails,

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.904
it's not just one thing,

00:01:02.928 --> 00:01:06.577
it's actually a cocktail
of toxic molecules

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:11.132
that are packaged and delivered
through a false tooth called a radula.

00:01:11.156 --> 00:01:14.133
You can think of the radulas
as hypodermic needles.

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:15.323
Now, no need to worry,

00:01:15.347 --> 00:01:17.599
these snails are practicing
good needle habits,

00:01:17.623 --> 00:01:20.122
because each radula is only used once.

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:23.249
Now from your own knowledge
about venomous organisms,

00:01:23.273 --> 00:01:27.151
and the keep-you-up-at-night
fish-killing video that I just showed you,

00:01:27.175 --> 00:01:30.944
you might think that venom
is dangerous and all bad.

00:01:30.968 --> 00:01:32.865
Well, yes and no.

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:34.815
A more accurate way of thinking of venom

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:39.426
is to think of it as both
a supervillain and a superhero.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.966
In my lab, we study the evolution
of venom in these sea snails

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.514
as a force for good.

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:46.093
Sounds like a stretch,

00:01:46.117 --> 00:01:47.712
or maybe even snake oil,

00:01:47.736 --> 00:01:48.909
but actually,

00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:51.688
while there are snakes involved,
the product is legit.

00:01:51.712 --> 00:01:54.156
One reason the venom product
is so successful

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.337
is that it transforms a physical warfare
into a biochemical one.

00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:03.535
Where usually the predator-prey
interaction is one of brute force,

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:05.736
venom takes it to a molecular scale.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.879
And it's not size that matters,

00:02:07.903 --> 00:02:10.006
but the mixture of your venom arsenal.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.561
The chemistry of the toxins
in your arsenal

00:02:12.585 --> 00:02:16.030
is what's going to enable David
to conquer Goliath.

00:02:16.054 --> 00:02:19.411
And in our scenario,
David is clearly the snail.

00:02:19.435 --> 00:02:22.578
Another feature of venom
that makes it so successful

00:02:22.602 --> 00:02:26.836
is that the toxins work
with the precision of a Swiss Army knife.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.059
And so these toxins,

00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:31.875
they come for strongholds
that help an organism to function.

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:35.434
So they target blood, brain and membranes.

00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:38.037
Whether it's snail venom or snake venom,

00:02:38.061 --> 00:02:40.537
they each have components
that can do things

00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:42.593
like cause your blood to clot,

00:02:42.617 --> 00:02:44.403
what we call "hemotoxic."

00:02:44.427 --> 00:02:48.467
Or they cause neurons in your brains
to not function normally,

00:02:48.491 --> 00:02:49.951
what we call "neurotoxic."

00:02:49.975 --> 00:02:54.411
Or they have toxins that will poke holes
into the membranes of your cells,

00:02:54.435 --> 00:02:57.708
causing them to rupture
and, basically, explode,

00:02:57.732 --> 00:02:59.439
what we call "cytotoxic."

00:02:59.463 --> 00:03:01.693
Cellular explosion, people.

00:03:01.717 --> 00:03:04.653
Now, if that is not all powerful
and all present,

00:03:04.677 --> 00:03:05.944
nothing is.

00:03:05.968 --> 00:03:07.564
Now a little about me,

00:03:07.588 --> 00:03:09.999
and why I'm so obsessed with venom.

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.347
I grew up in New York City

00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:15.387
with forced access
to the Natural History Museum.

00:03:15.411 --> 00:03:16.799
I say "forced access,"

00:03:16.823 --> 00:03:18.289
because I'm one of five kids,

00:03:18.313 --> 00:03:21.894
and my parents used museums
as a form of childcare.

00:03:22.253 --> 00:03:23.452
There were two rules:

00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:24.737
Don't lose anybody

00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:27.087
and meet Mom and Dad
at the African elephants

00:03:27.111 --> 00:03:29.483
at 5:30, when the museum closes.

00:03:29.507 --> 00:03:35.138
Those totally unsupervised days
running through the halls of the museum

00:03:35.162 --> 00:03:37.974
were full of adventure and exploration.

00:03:37.998 --> 00:03:40.569
And that's how I feel
when I'm studying venom.

00:03:40.593 --> 00:03:42.307
It's a scientific adventure.

00:03:42.331 --> 00:03:47.587
We're boldly exploring this entity
that connects nature and humanity.

00:03:47.611 --> 00:03:49.817
Another reason
that I'm obsessed with venom

00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:51.585
is because of its duality.

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.252
When you inject the components
of a venom arsenal into an organism,

00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:57.633
it can kill or it can cure.

00:03:57.657 --> 00:04:00.299
At a molecular level,
several things can happen.

00:04:00.601 --> 00:04:03.704
You saw one thing, paralysis in the fish.

00:04:04.134 --> 00:04:06.666
Now that was happening
because the toxins in the venom

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.927
were attacking how the fish's cells
communicate with each other,

00:04:09.951 --> 00:04:11.982
preventing it from swimming away.

00:04:12.006 --> 00:04:15.334
Are there other things
that I would like to use venom to attack?

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.926
For sure.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.768
And one of those is cancer.

00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:20.848
Cancer tumors are cells.

00:04:20.872 --> 00:04:22.031
And like all cells,

00:04:22.055 --> 00:04:25.228
they communicate with themselves
and their environment around them.

00:04:25.252 --> 00:04:27.434
So we would like to find venom components

00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:31.354
that are very good at disrupting
how the tumor cells communicate.

00:04:31.378 --> 00:04:36.188
Similar to how the venom disrupted
how the fish cells communicated

00:04:36.212 --> 00:04:38.291
and the fish couldn't swim away.

00:04:38.315 --> 00:04:41.654
In my lab, we study cancer
as a channelopathy.

00:04:41.998 --> 00:04:45.405
What this means is, basically,
we're looking for venom components

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:49.231
that will target channels
that are overexpressed in tumor cells

00:04:49.255 --> 00:04:50.540
versus normal cells.

00:04:50.564 --> 00:04:53.085
The cancer that we're most
focused on right now

00:04:53.109 --> 00:04:54.442
is liver cancer.

00:04:54.466 --> 00:04:56.808
And that's because since the 1980s,

00:04:56.832 --> 00:04:59.537
the death rate of liver
cancer has doubled,

00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:01.942
and it's an emerging threat in the US.

00:05:01.966 --> 00:05:04.260
In a screen in which we had cervical,

00:05:04.284 --> 00:05:07.483
neuroblastoma, prostate
and liver cancer cells,

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:09.998
we found a compound from a terebrid snail

00:05:10.022 --> 00:05:13.315
that seems to attack liver cancer cells,

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:17.022
and only liver cancer cells,
and none of the others that were tested.

00:05:17.046 --> 00:05:20.490
And then, when we took this compound
and we injected it into mouse models

00:05:20.514 --> 00:05:22.507
that were expressing liver cancer cells,

00:05:22.531 --> 00:05:25.766
it significantly inhibited
the growth of the tumors.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.006
We're not quite sure how this works yet,

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.895
we're still investigating the mechanism

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.673
and how we can make
this compound more effective,

00:05:32.697 --> 00:05:34.640
so you can't rush out to the pharmacy

00:05:34.664 --> 00:05:38.847
and order up a killer snail
liver-cancer therapy treatment.

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:40.109
Not yet.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.283
Basically, what we think is happening

00:05:42.307 --> 00:05:45.823
is that the compound is blocking
a specific channel,

00:05:45.847 --> 00:05:48.609
prohibiting the transmission
of a specific chemical

00:05:48.633 --> 00:05:50.846
that leads to downstream signaling

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.132
that enables the tumor to multiply
and draw blood to itself.

00:05:55.156 --> 00:05:58.133
What we're doing in studying
the components of venom

00:05:58.157 --> 00:06:00.848
to find treatments for human
diseases and disorders,

00:06:00.872 --> 00:06:02.156
is not new,

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.950
it's what we call natural
products drug discovery,

00:06:04.974 --> 00:06:06.784
and it's been happening for centuries,

00:06:06.808 --> 00:06:08.990
and in cultures all over the world.

00:06:09.014 --> 00:06:11.474
Venoms are not only giving us
cool new compounds,

00:06:11.498 --> 00:06:14.284
but they're also giving us
new ways of thinking

00:06:14.308 --> 00:06:17.185
about how we treat
human diseases and disorders.

00:06:17.521 --> 00:06:19.267
And I'll give you three examples.

00:06:19.291 --> 00:06:22.117
The first is from killer
snails, of course.

00:06:22.141 --> 00:06:26.037
And so the first drug from these snails
that is on the market

00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:28.863
is called ziconotide, or Prialt,

00:06:28.887 --> 00:06:32.989
and it's used to treat chronic pain
in HIV and cancer patients.

00:06:33.013 --> 00:06:35.790
Prialt is a nonaddictive pain therapy.

00:06:36.227 --> 00:06:40.185
Three magic words when you think
about how we're treating pain currently.

00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:43.550
We're using things that have
a huge cost of addiction.

00:06:43.574 --> 00:06:44.743
So think of morphine

00:06:44.767 --> 00:06:47.609
or think of any of your favorite
opioid out there.

00:06:47.633 --> 00:06:48.895
What the snails have done

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:53.332
is they've shown us a way to treat pain
without the addiction,

00:06:53.356 --> 00:06:54.506
which is huge.

00:06:55.055 --> 00:06:58.364
The next example comes
from the Brazilian pit viper.

00:06:58.388 --> 00:07:01.776
From these snakes, we've derived
a compound called captopril.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.879
Captopril is used to treat
high blood pressure,

00:07:04.903 --> 00:07:07.403
and captopril is a breakthrough drug.

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:09.577
But not only in and of itself,

00:07:09.601 --> 00:07:12.529
but because it advanced
a whole class of drugs,

00:07:12.553 --> 00:07:14.609
what we know as ACE inhibitors,

00:07:14.633 --> 00:07:18.133
which are the most commonly [prescribed]
for treating hypertension

00:07:18.157 --> 00:07:19.585
and heart failure.

00:07:19.609 --> 00:07:23.387
The last example is from the Gila monster.

00:07:23.411 --> 00:07:27.332
And this is a really exciting example
of understanding the ecology

00:07:27.356 --> 00:07:28.705
of these organisms,

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:31.037
and pairing it with efficient
drug discovery.

00:07:31.061 --> 00:07:33.125
And Gila monsters are binge eaters.

00:07:33.149 --> 00:07:35.537
So when they bite into a large meal,

00:07:35.561 --> 00:07:38.955
they release things in their venom
that lower blood sugar.

00:07:38.979 --> 00:07:42.892
So what's the drug that you think
we found from the Gila monster?

00:07:42.916 --> 00:07:47.116
A compound that is used to lower
the blood sugar in diabetic patients.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.188
Now these are three marvelous examples,

00:07:49.212 --> 00:07:51.260
but we've just scratched the surface.

00:07:51.284 --> 00:07:54.077
There's so much more venom
out there for us to study.

00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:57.673
In fact, we think that 15 percent
of all the animals on the planet

00:07:57.697 --> 00:07:58.880
are venomous.

00:07:58.904 --> 00:08:00.594
And I think this is a low estimate,

00:08:00.618 --> 00:08:03.959
given the fact that we haven't surveyed
all the animals on the planet.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:06.630
But nature seems to have found
something that she likes,

00:08:06.654 --> 00:08:09.853
and she's repeated it
over and over and over again,

00:08:09.877 --> 00:08:12.615
leading to the vast array of animals
that we see around us

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:14.576
and all throughout the tree of life.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.156
So whether we're talking
about my fave, killer snails,

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.449
or jellyfish,

00:08:19.473 --> 00:08:22.228
or the larvae of butterflies and moths,

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:24.863
or platypus or slow lorises,

00:08:24.887 --> 00:08:27.887
whether by sea, land or air,

00:08:27.911 --> 00:08:30.633
you're sure to encounter
a venomous creature.

00:08:30.657 --> 00:08:32.069
Remember when I told you

00:08:32.093 --> 00:08:36.188
that venom can be both
a superhero and a supervillain,

00:08:36.212 --> 00:08:37.768
and you doubted me?

00:08:37.792 --> 00:08:38.974
Mhm.

00:08:38.998 --> 00:08:42.086
We're in a race to harness
all of this venom goodness

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.110
before we lose the vast majority
of animals on our planet.

00:08:45.134 --> 00:08:46.840
It's a holistic process.

00:08:46.864 --> 00:08:51.426
You can't have the therapeutic treatments
without having the animals.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:53.085
And you can't have the animals

00:08:53.109 --> 00:08:54.856
without having their ecosystems.

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.539
So for me and the snails,

00:08:56.563 --> 00:08:59.318
what it means is
we have to save the oceans.

00:08:59.342 --> 00:09:01.739
And because venomous animals
are found everywhere,

00:09:01.763 --> 00:09:03.778
we basically have to save the planet.

00:09:03.802 --> 00:09:05.548
So do it for the venomous animals,

00:09:05.572 --> 00:09:07.491
