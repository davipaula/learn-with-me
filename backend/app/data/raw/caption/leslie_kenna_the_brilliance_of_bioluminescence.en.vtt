00:00:14.226 --> 00:00:15.931
Imagine a place so dark

00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:18.149
you can't see the nose on your face.

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:21.217
Eyes opened or closed, it's all the same

00:00:21.217 --> 00:00:23.985
because the sun never shines there.

00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:26.073
Up ahead, you see a light.

00:00:26.073 --> 00:00:27.961
When you creep in to investigate,

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:30.212
a blue light flits around you.

00:00:30.212 --> 00:00:32.396
"I could watch this forever," you think.

00:00:32.396 --> 00:00:33.417
But you can't

00:00:33.417 --> 00:00:36.268
because the mouth of an anglerfish has just sprung open

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:38.471
and eaten you alive.

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:40.046
You are just one of many creatures

00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:42.352
at the bottom of the ocean who learn too late

00:00:42.352 --> 00:00:45.939
to appreciate the power of bioluminescence.

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:48.233
Bioluminescence refers to the ability

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:50.858
of certain living things to create light.

00:00:50.858 --> 00:00:52.535
The human body can make stuff

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:55.626
like ear wax and toe nails,

00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:57.214
but these organisms can turn

00:00:57.214 --> 00:00:59.862
parts of their body into glow sticks.

00:00:59.862 --> 00:01:02.230
It's like nature made them ready to rave.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.203
Why?

00:01:03.203 --> 00:01:04.539
In one way or another,

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:08.601
bioluminescence improves a living thing's chances of survival.

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:10.044
Take the firefly.

00:01:10.044 --> 00:01:11.603
It's ability to glow green

00:01:11.603 --> 00:01:14.434
helps it attract a mate on a warm, summer night,

00:01:14.434 --> 00:01:17.342
but it's just one of many living things that can glow.

00:01:17.342 --> 00:01:20.054
The railroad worm, Phrixothrix hirtus,

00:01:20.054 --> 00:01:21.936
can light up its body in two colors:

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:23.171
red and green.

00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:24.261
Would you eat something

00:01:24.261 --> 00:01:26.561
that looks like an airport runway?

00:01:26.561 --> 00:01:28.813
Neither would any sensible predator.

00:01:28.813 --> 00:01:31.719
The flashing lights keep the worm safe.

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:33.778
Then there's the deep sea shrimp,

00:01:33.778 --> 00:01:35.527
Acantherphyra purpurea.

00:01:35.527 --> 00:01:36.862
When it feels threatened,

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:40.027
it spews a cloud of glowing goo from its mouth.

00:01:40.027 --> 00:01:41.326
Who doesn't run the other way

00:01:41.326 --> 00:01:43.600
when they've just been puked on?

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.143
Plus, that puke attracts bigger predators

00:01:46.143 --> 00:01:48.386
who want to eat the shrimp's enemy.

00:01:48.386 --> 00:01:50.687
So what if you can't bioluminesce?

00:01:50.687 --> 00:01:51.741
No problem!

00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:53.322
There are other ways for living things

00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:55.524
to make bioluminescence work for them,

00:01:55.524 --> 00:01:58.556
even if they weren't born with the equipment to glow.

00:01:58.556 --> 00:02:00.400
Let's revisit the anglerfish

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.402
moments before it tried to eat you.

00:02:02.402 --> 00:02:04.196
That glowing bait on top of its head?

00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:07.181
It comes from a pocket of skin called the esca.

00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:10.035
The esca holds bioluminescent bacteria.

00:02:10.035 --> 00:02:12.290
The anglerfish can't glow there by itself,

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.327
so it holds a sack of glowing bacteria instead.

00:02:16.327 --> 00:02:18.001
Remember the firefly?

00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:20.083
It can actually make itself glow.

00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:22.674
Inside its lantern are two chemicals,

00:02:22.674 --> 00:02:25.190
a luciferin and a luciferase.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.095
When firefly luciferase and luciferin mix together

00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:29.389
in the presence of oxygen

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:31.474
and fuel for the cell, called ATP,

00:02:31.474 --> 00:02:35.184
the chemical reaction gives off energy in the form of light.

00:02:35.184 --> 00:02:36.644
Once scientists figured out

00:02:36.644 --> 00:02:39.606
how the firefly creates its luciferase and luciferin,

00:02:39.606 --> 00:02:41.193
they used genetic engineering

00:02:41.193 --> 00:02:43.110
to make this light-producing reaction

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.259
occur inside other living things that can't glow.

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:48.461
For example, they inserted the genes,

00:02:48.461 --> 00:02:50.123
or instructions, for a cell

00:02:50.123 --> 00:02:54.363
to create firefly luciferase and luciferin into a tobacco plant.

00:02:54.363 --> 00:02:57.216
Once there, the tobacco plant followed the instructions

00:02:57.216 --> 00:03:01.231
slipped into its DNA and lit up like a Christmas tree.

00:03:01.231 --> 00:03:02.794
The beauty of bioluminescence,

00:03:02.794 --> 00:03:05.544
unlike the light from the sun or an incandescent bulb,

00:03:05.544 --> 00:03:07.136
is that it's not hot.

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:09.422
It takes place in a range of temperatures

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:11.406
that don't burn a living thing.

00:03:11.406 --> 00:03:12.844
And unlike a glow stick,

00:03:12.844 --> 00:03:15.720
which fades out as the chemicals inside get used up,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.466
bioluminescent reactions use replenishable resources.

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:20.931
That's one reason engineers

00:03:20.931 --> 00:03:24.221
are trying to develop bioluminescent trees.

00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:26.767
Just think, if planted on the side of highways,

00:03:26.767 --> 00:03:28.817
they could light the way, using only oxygen

00:03:28.817 --> 00:03:32.464
and other freely available, clean resources to run.

00:03:32.464 --> 00:03:34.539
Talk about survival advantage!

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:37.157
That could help our planet live longer.

00:03:37.157 --> 00:03:39.494
Do you find yourself thinking of other ways

00:03:39.494 --> 00:03:42.363
to put bioluminescence to good use?

00:03:42.363 --> 00:03:44.402
That glow stick you swing at a rave

00:03:44.402 --> 00:03:46.001
may help you find a mate,

00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:49.754
but how else can bioluminescence improve your survival?

00:03:49.754 --> 00:03:51.631
If you start thinking in this way,

00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:53.466
you have seen the light.
