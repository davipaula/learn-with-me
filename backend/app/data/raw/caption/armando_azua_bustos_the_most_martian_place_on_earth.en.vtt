00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.576
This is a picture of a sunset on Mars

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.080
taken by NASA's Curiosity rover in 2013.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.816
Mars is a very cold planet,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.096
flooded with high levels of UV radiation

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.016
and extremely dry.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.160
In fact, Mars is considered
to be too dry for life as we know it.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.176
I'm an astrobiologist.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.096
I try to understand
the origin of life on Earth

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.336
and the possibilities of finding life

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.600
elsewhere in the universe.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.656
People sometimes ask me,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.856
how can you be an astrobiologist

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.680
if you don't have your own spaceship?

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.856
Well, what I do is that I study life

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.856
in those environments on Earth

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.200
that most closely resemble
other interesting places in the universe.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.576
All life on Earth requires water,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.136
so in my case I focus
on the intimate relationship

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.656
between water and life

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.256
in order to understand

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.520
if we could find life
in a planet as dry as Mars.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.976
But since I do not have
the 2.5 billion dollars

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.216
to send my own robot to Mars,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.176
I study the most Martian place on Earth,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.736
the Atacama Desert.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.416
Located in northern Chile,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.056
it is the oldest
and driest desert on Earth.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.056
To give you an idea of how dry it is,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.120
consider here in Vancouver it rains
over 1,000 millimeters of rain every year.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.496
In the Atacama, there are places
with no reported rains

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.320
in the last 400 years.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.576
How do I know this?

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.096
Well, because I was born
and raised in the Atacama --

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.736
(Laughter)

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.776
So I had a unique advantage

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.840
when I started studying this desert.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.416
So let me tell you guys
a few fantastic examples

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.096
he has found

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.320
on how life has adapted
to live with almost no water at all.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.216
One of my first findings
was in the entrance of a cave

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.976
facing the Pacific Ocean.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.696
In this place, we reported
a new type of microalgae

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.640
that grew only on top of the spiderwebs
that covered the cave entrance.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.760
Have you ever seen a spiderweb
early in the morning?

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.776
It's covered with dew,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.056
so this microalgae learned
that in order to carry photosynthesis

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.096
in the coast of the driest
desert on Earth,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.616
they could use the spiderwebs.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.056
So here they may access
the water from the fogs

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.320
that regularly cover
these areas in the morning.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.480
In another cave, we found
a different type of microalgae.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.336
This one is able to use ocean mist
as a source of water,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.496
and strikingly lives
in the very bottom of a cave,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.736
so it has adapted to live
with less than 0.1 percent

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.880
of the amount of light
that regular plants need.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.016
These type of findings
suggest to me that on Mars,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.896
we may find even
photosynthetic life inside caves.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.296
And by the way, that's me.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.136
(Laughter)

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.896
Now, for almost 15 years
this region of Yungay, discovered by NASA,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.936
was thought to be
the driest place of this desert,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.696
but I knew that it was not.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.096
How? You already know the answer.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.336
Because I was born
and raised in this desert.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.016
So I remembered that I
usually see fogs in Yungay,

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.256
so after setting sensors
in a number of places,

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.336
where I remember
never seeing fogs or clouds,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.376
I reported four other sites
much drier than Yungay,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.016
with this one, MarÃ­a Elena South,

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.496
being the truly driest place on Earth,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.496
as dry as Mars,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.856
and amazingly, just a 15-minute ride

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.160
from the small mining town
where I was born.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.416
Now, in this search, we were trying
to actually find the dry limit

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.656
for life on Earth,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.536
a place so dry that nothing
was able to survive in it.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.136
But even here, well hidden underground,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.576
we found a number
of different microorganisms,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.056
which suggested to me
that similarly dry places, like Mars,

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.280
may be inhabited.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.656
We even have some preliminary evidences

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.216
that these microorganisms
may still be active

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.176
in the desiccated state,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.016
like walking mummies all around us,

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.160
and that they may be using
UV radiation as a source of energy.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.456
If confirmed, this would have
a huge impact on our definition of life,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.000
on how we look for life
elsewhere in the universe.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.776
Due to its clear skies, by 2020,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.456
60 percent of the biggest
telescopes on Earth

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.696
will be located in the Atacama,

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.616
and while everyone else
will be looking among the stars

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.880
to answer the question, "Are we alone?"

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.696
I will be looking down to the ground

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.296
searching for this same answer

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.520
in my own backyard.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.176
Thank you.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.360
(Applause)
