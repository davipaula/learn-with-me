00:00:13.318 --> 00:00:16.088
At this very moment,

00:00:16.112 --> 00:00:19.011
with every breath we take,

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:23.958
major delta cities
across the globe are sinking,

00:00:23.982 --> 00:00:26.674
including New York, London,

00:00:26.698 --> 00:00:30.344
Tokyo, Shanghai, New Orleans,

00:00:30.368 --> 00:00:33.389
and as well as my city, Bangkok.

00:00:35.017 --> 00:00:39.009
Here is the usual version
of climate change.

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:42.030
This is mine.

00:00:42.594 --> 00:00:43.744
Nothing much,

00:00:43.768 --> 00:00:45.612
just a crocodile on the street.

00:00:45.636 --> 00:00:47.154
(Laughter)

00:00:47.178 --> 00:00:50.499
This is an urgent impact
of climate change:

00:00:50.523 --> 00:00:52.355
over sinking cities.

00:00:54.292 --> 00:00:58.349
Here, you can see
the urbanization of Bangkok,

00:00:58.373 --> 00:01:01.401
growing in every direction,

00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:04.975
shifting from porous, agricultural land --

00:01:05.894 --> 00:01:09.161
the land that can breathe
and absorb water --

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:11.446
to a concrete jungle.

00:01:13.717 --> 00:01:18.222
This is what parts of it look like
after 30 minutes of rainfall.

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.553
And every time it rains,

00:01:20.577 --> 00:01:23.486
I wish my car could turn into a boat.

00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:27.178
This land has no room for water.

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.519
It has lost its absorbent capacity.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.882
The reality of Bangkok's
metropolitan region

00:01:37.906 --> 00:01:43.028
is a city of 15 million people

00:01:43.052 --> 00:01:48.734
living, working and commuting
on top of a shifting, muddy river delta.

00:01:49.883 --> 00:01:54.959
Bangkok is sinking
more than one centimeter per year,

00:01:54.983 --> 00:02:01.949
which is four times faster
than the rate of predicted sea level rise.

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:08.266
And we could be below sea level by 2030,

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.130
which will be here too soon.

00:02:12.946 --> 00:02:19.041
There is no coincidence that I am here
as a landscape architect.

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:23.414
As a child, I grew up in a row house

00:02:23.438 --> 00:02:27.019
next to the busy road
always filled with traffic.

00:02:28.602 --> 00:02:32.809
In front of my house,
there was a concrete parking lot,

00:02:32.833 --> 00:02:34.998
and that was my playground.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.563
The only living creature I would find,

00:02:40.587 --> 00:02:42.257
and had fun with,

00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:47.532
were these sneaky little plants
trying to grow through the crack

00:02:47.556 --> 00:02:49.054
of the concrete pavement.

00:02:49.943 --> 00:02:52.363
My favorite game with friends

00:02:52.387 --> 00:02:58.795
was to dig a bigger
and bigger hole through this crack

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.613
to let this little plant creep out --

00:03:01.637 --> 00:03:03.642
sneak out more and more.

00:03:05.535 --> 00:03:08.901
And yes, landscape architecture

00:03:08.925 --> 00:03:14.012
gives me the opportunity
to continue my cracking ambition --

00:03:14.036 --> 00:03:15.520
(Laughter)

00:03:15.544 --> 00:03:19.879
to connect this concrete land
back to nature.

00:03:22.053 --> 00:03:25.280
Before, Thais -- my people --

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:31.182
we were adapted to the cycle
of the wet and dry season,

00:03:31.206 --> 00:03:34.920
and you could call us amphibious.

00:03:34.944 --> 00:03:35.945
(Laughter)

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:38.245
We lived both on land and on water.

00:03:38.841 --> 00:03:41.254
We were adapted to both.

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:47.319
And flooding was a happy event,
when the water fertilized our land.

00:03:49.115 --> 00:03:50.819
But now, flooding means ...

00:03:52.493 --> 00:03:53.643
disaster.

00:03:54.654 --> 00:03:56.337
In 2011,

00:03:56.361 --> 00:04:03.107
Thailand was hit by the most damaging
and the most expensive flood disaster

00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:04.382
in our history.

00:04:05.094 --> 00:04:09.062
Flooding has turned central Thailand
into an enormous lake.

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.916
Here, you can see the scale of the flood
in the center of the image,

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.662
to the scale of Bangkok,
outlined in yellow.

00:04:20.401 --> 00:04:22.866
The water was overflowing from the north,

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.900
making its way across several provinces.

00:04:28.681 --> 00:04:32.047
Millions of my people,

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:35.311
including me and my family,

00:04:35.335 --> 00:04:37.946
were displaced and homeless.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.318
Some had to escape the city.

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:47.199
Many were terrified of losing
their home and their belongings,

00:04:47.223 --> 00:04:52.838
so they stayed back in the flood
with no electricity and clean water.

00:04:55.392 --> 00:04:57.969
For me, this flood reflects clearly

00:04:57.993 --> 00:05:01.364
that our modern infrastructure,

00:05:02.597 --> 00:05:07.716
and especially our notion
of fighting flood with concrete,

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.517
had made us so extremely vulnerable
to the climate uncertainty.

00:05:15.758 --> 00:05:19.358
But in the heart of this disaster,

00:05:19.382 --> 00:05:20.740
I found my calling.

00:05:21.477 --> 00:05:25.689
I cannot just sit and wait
as my city continues to sink.

00:05:27.171 --> 00:05:29.141
The city needed me,

00:05:29.165 --> 00:05:33.200
and I had the ability to fix this problem.

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:36.393
Six years ago,

00:05:37.574 --> 00:05:39.486
I started my project.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.859
My teams and I won the design competition
for Chulalongkorn Centenary Park.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.548
This was the big, bold mission
of the first university in Thailand

00:05:52.572 --> 00:05:56.597
for celebrating its hundredth anniversary

00:05:56.621 --> 00:06:01.754
by giving this piece of land
as a public park to our city.

00:06:03.493 --> 00:06:08.840
Having a park sounds very normal
to many other cities,

00:06:08.864 --> 00:06:11.992
but not in Bangkok,

00:06:12.016 --> 00:06:17.901
which has one of the lowest
public green space per capita

00:06:17.925 --> 00:06:20.129
among megacities in Asia.

00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:26.664
Our project's become
the first new public park

00:06:26.688 --> 00:06:29.238
in almost 30 years.

00:06:29.712 --> 00:06:32.149
The 11-acre park --

00:06:32.173 --> 00:06:36.258
a big green crack
at the heart of Bangkok --

00:06:36.282 --> 00:06:38.032
opened just last year.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.215
(Applause and cheers)

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:41.434
Thank you.

00:06:41.458 --> 00:06:45.546
(Applause)

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.483
For four years, we have pushed
through countless meetings

00:06:50.507 --> 00:06:54.071
to convince and never
give up to convincing

00:06:54.095 --> 00:06:59.707
that this park isn't just
for beautification or recreation:

00:06:59.731 --> 00:07:02.424
it must help the city deal with water,

00:07:02.448 --> 00:07:05.424
it must help the city
confront climate change.

00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:07.615
And here is how it works.

00:07:08.488 --> 00:07:10.759
Bangkok is a flat city,

00:07:10.783 --> 00:07:15.759
so we harnessed the power of gravity
by inclining the whole park

00:07:15.783 --> 00:07:18.346
to collect every drop of rain.

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.029
The gravity force pulls down
the runoff from the highest point

00:07:24.053 --> 00:07:25.607
to the lowest point.

00:07:26.551 --> 00:07:31.102
This park has three main elements
that work as one system.

00:07:31.854 --> 00:07:33.603
The first -- the green roof.

00:07:34.594 --> 00:07:37.748
This is the biggest
green roof in Thailand,

00:07:37.772 --> 00:07:41.337
with the rainwater tanks
and museum underneath.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.261
In the dry season,

00:07:44.285 --> 00:07:49.775
the collected rain can be used
to water the park for up to a month.

00:07:51.313 --> 00:07:54.733
The runoff on the green roof
then falls through wetlands

00:07:55.646 --> 00:07:59.402
with the native water plants
that can help filter

00:07:59.426 --> 00:08:01.061
and help clean water.

00:08:02.223 --> 00:08:04.049
And at the lower end,

00:08:04.073 --> 00:08:08.366
the retention pond
collects all of the water.

00:08:09.466 --> 00:08:13.014
At this pond, there are water bikes.

00:08:13.604 --> 00:08:17.682
People can pedal and help clean water.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:24.025
Their exercise becomes an active part
of the park water system.

00:08:25.698 --> 00:08:27.619
When life gives you a flood,

00:08:27.643 --> 00:08:29.520
you have fun with the water.

00:08:29.544 --> 00:08:31.293
(Laughter)

00:08:32.608 --> 00:08:36.950
Centenary Park gives room for people
and room for water,

00:08:36.974 --> 00:08:40.488
which is exactly
what we and our cities need.

00:08:43.114 --> 00:08:47.038
This is an amphibious design.

00:08:47.466 --> 00:08:50.336
This park is not
about getting rid of flood.

00:08:50.753 --> 00:08:53.963
It's about creating a way to live with it.

00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:59.194
And not a single drop of rain
is wasted in this park.

00:09:00.133 --> 00:09:06.135
This park can hold and collect
a million gallons of water.

00:09:08.873 --> 00:09:10.023
(Applause)

00:09:10.047 --> 00:09:11.237
Thank you.

00:09:11.261 --> 00:09:15.319
(Applause)

00:09:15.343 --> 00:09:19.207
Every given project, for me,
is an opportunity

00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:23.311
to create more green cracks
through this concrete jungle

00:09:24.441 --> 00:09:28.902
by using landscape architecture
as a solution,

00:09:28.926 --> 00:09:34.041
like turning this concrete roof
into an urban farm,

00:09:34.065 --> 00:09:37.064
which can help absorb rain;

00:09:37.088 --> 00:09:39.248
reduce urban heat island

00:09:39.272 --> 00:09:41.676
and grow food in the middle of the city;

00:09:43.112 --> 00:09:46.684
reuse the abandoned concrete structure

00:09:46.708 --> 00:09:49.961
to become a green pedestrian bridge;

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:55.940
and another flood-proof park
at Thammasat University,

00:09:55.964 --> 00:10:01.780
which nearly completes the biggest
green roof on an academic campus yet

00:10:01.804 --> 00:10:03.426
in Southeast Asia.

00:10:06.807 --> 00:10:11.366
Severe flooding is our new normal,

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:15.306
putting the southeast Asian region --

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.617
the region with the most coastline --

00:10:18.641 --> 00:10:20.329
at extreme risk.

00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:25.128
Creating a park is just one solution.

00:10:26.685 --> 00:10:28.319
The awareness of climate change

00:10:28.343 --> 00:10:34.555
means we, in every profession
we are involved,

00:10:34.579 --> 00:10:39.590
are increasingly obligated
to understand the climate risk

00:10:39.614 --> 00:10:45.251
and put whatever we are working on
as part of the solution.

00:10:46.386 --> 00:10:50.902
Because if our cities continue

00:10:50.926 --> 00:10:52.672
the way they are now,

00:10:53.854 --> 00:10:57.179
a similar catastrophe
will happen again ...

00:10:57.964 --> 00:10:59.452
and again.

00:11:01.531 --> 00:11:04.779
Creating a solution
in these sinking cities

00:11:04.803 --> 00:11:10.429
is like making the impossible possible.

00:11:11.909 --> 00:11:13.059
And for that,

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:19.638
I would like to share one word
that I always keep in mind,

00:11:19.662 --> 00:11:22.277
that is, "tangjai."

00:11:23.968 --> 00:11:30.150
The literal translation
for "tang" is "to firmly stand,"

00:11:31.942 --> 00:11:35.079
and "jai" means "heart."

00:11:36.723 --> 00:11:40.128
Firmly stand your heart at your goal.

00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:45.939
In Thai language,
when you commit to do something,

00:11:45.963 --> 00:11:49.096
you put tangjai in front of your word,

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:53.085
so your heart will be in your action.

00:11:54.023 --> 00:11:56.223
No matter how rough the path,

00:11:56.247 --> 00:11:58.230
how big the crack,

00:11:58.254 --> 00:12:00.119
you push through to your goal,

00:12:00.143 --> 00:12:02.637
because that's where your heart is.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.537
And yes, Thailand is home.

00:12:10.107 --> 00:12:12.180
This land is my only home,

00:12:13.648 --> 00:12:18.826
and that's where I firmly stand my heart.

00:12:19.637 --> 00:12:21.296
Where do you stand yours?

00:12:21.954 --> 00:12:23.105
Thank you.

00:12:23.129 --> 00:12:24.146
(Applause)

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:25.321
Thank you.

00:12:25.345 --> 00:12:26.496
Kòp kun ka.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.738
(Applause and cheers)
