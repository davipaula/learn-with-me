00:00:12.787 --> 00:00:17.014
Have you ever watched
a flock of birds work together?

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.757
Thousands of animals,
flying in perfect synchrony:

00:00:24.142 --> 00:00:25.923
Isn't it fascinating?

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.333
What I find remarkable is that these birds
would not be able to do that

00:00:32.357 --> 00:00:35.339
if they all would have
to follow one leader.

00:00:36.185 --> 00:00:39.100
Their reaction speed
would simply be too low.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.594
Instead, scientists believe
that these birds are aligned on

00:00:44.618 --> 00:00:46.421
a few simple rules,

00:00:47.353 --> 00:00:52.045
allowing every single bird
to make autonomous decisions

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:54.350
while still flying in perfect synchrony.

00:00:55.275 --> 00:00:58.979
Their alignment enables their autonomy,

00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:03.168
and their autonomy
makes them fast and flexible.

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.521
Now, what does this have to do
with any one of us?

00:01:09.248 --> 00:01:15.394
Well, it's one way of illustrating what
I believe to be the most important change

00:01:15.418 --> 00:01:18.314
that is needed in ways of working today.

00:01:19.123 --> 00:01:22.221
The world is getting faster
and more complex,

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:24.598
so we need a new way of working,

00:01:24.622 --> 00:01:28.372
a way that creates
alignment around purpose,

00:01:28.396 --> 00:01:30.265
that takes out bureaucracy

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.789
and that truly empowers people
to make decisions faster.

00:01:35.591 --> 00:01:37.450
But the question is:

00:01:37.474 --> 00:01:38.917
In order to get there,

00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:42.144
what are we willing to give up?

00:01:44.087 --> 00:01:46.997
A few years ago, I was working with a bank

00:01:47.021 --> 00:01:50.318
that wanted to embark
on a digital transformation.

00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:54.770
They wanted their offering to be simpler,
more intuitive, more relevant.

00:01:55.913 --> 00:02:01.054
Now, I'm not sure how many of you
have seen a bank from the inside,

00:02:01.078 --> 00:02:04.894
so let me try to illustrate
what many traditional banks look like.

00:02:05.857 --> 00:02:08.944
You see lots of people in suits

00:02:08.968 --> 00:02:12.205
taking elevators to go
to their department,

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:16.462
marketers sitting with marketers,
engineers with engineers, etc.

00:02:17.526 --> 00:02:19.836
You see meetings with 20 people

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.242
where nothing gets decided.

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:26.031
Great ideas? They end up
in PowerPoint parking lots.

00:02:26.978 --> 00:02:30.846
And there are endless handovers
between departments.

00:02:31.658 --> 00:02:34.864
Getting anything done can take forever.

00:02:35.988 --> 00:02:39.408
So this bank knew
that in order to transform,

00:02:39.432 --> 00:02:42.072
they would have to improve
their time to market

00:02:42.096 --> 00:02:46.024
by drastically changing
their ways of working as well.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.041
But how?

00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:52.776
To get some inspiration, we decided
to go and have a look at companies

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.753
that seem to be more innovative,

00:02:54.777 --> 00:02:58.667
like Google, Netflix, Spotify, Zappos.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.839
And I remember how we were walking
the halls at one of these companies

00:03:02.863 --> 00:03:04.854
in December 2014,

00:03:04.878 --> 00:03:07.686
a management consultant
and a team of bankers.

00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:10.953
We felt like strangers in a strange land,

00:03:10.977 --> 00:03:13.101
surrounded by beanbags and hoodies

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:15.537
and lots of smart, creative employees.

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:19.202
So then we asked,
"How is your company organized?"

00:03:19.808 --> 00:03:21.994
And we expected to get an org chart.

00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:25.506
But instead, they used strange drawings

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.259
with funny names like "squads"
and "chapters" and "tribes"

00:03:29.283 --> 00:03:31.035
to explain how they were organized.

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:35.494
So then we tried to translate
that to our own world.

00:03:35.518 --> 00:03:38.928
We asked, "How many people
are working for you?"

00:03:39.858 --> 00:03:41.509
"It depends."

00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:43.058
"Who do you report to?"

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.247
"It depends."

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.125
"Who decides on your priorities?"

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:50.168
"It depends."

00:03:50.785 --> 00:03:52.573
You can imagine our surprise.

00:03:52.597 --> 00:03:55.957
We were asking for what we thought
were some of the basic principles

00:03:55.981 --> 00:03:57.154
of organizations,

00:03:57.178 --> 00:03:59.968
and their answer was, "It depends."

00:04:01.404 --> 00:04:03.013
Now, over the course of that day,

00:04:03.037 --> 00:04:05.548
we gained a better
understanding of their model.

00:04:05.572 --> 00:04:09.490
They believed in the power
of small, autonomous teams.

00:04:09.514 --> 00:04:11.439
Their teams were like mini-start-ups.

00:04:11.463 --> 00:04:15.069
They had product people
and IT engineers in the same team

00:04:15.093 --> 00:04:18.775
so they could design, build
and test ideas with customers

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.415
independently of others in the company.

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:24.041
They did not need handovers
between departments.

00:04:24.065 --> 00:04:27.478
They had all the skills needed
right there in the team.

00:04:29.033 --> 00:04:31.895
Now, at the end of that day,
we had a session

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.927
to reflect on what we had learned.

00:04:34.644 --> 00:04:36.549
And we had started to like their model,

00:04:36.573 --> 00:04:40.669
so we were already thinking of how
to apply some of these ideas to a bank.

00:04:42.106 --> 00:04:46.272
But then, one of the hosts,
a guy who had not said a word all day,

00:04:46.296 --> 00:04:48.059
he suddenly said,

00:04:48.083 --> 00:04:50.035
"So I see you like our model.

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:51.997
But I have one question for you:

00:04:52.941 --> 00:04:55.009
What are you willing to give up?"

00:04:56.989 --> 00:04:58.731
What were we willing to give up?

00:04:59.627 --> 00:05:03.050
We did not have an answer immediately,
but we knew he was right.

00:05:03.574 --> 00:05:06.368
Change is not only about
embracing the new;

00:05:06.392 --> 00:05:09.646
it's about giving up
on some of the old as well.

00:05:11.013 --> 00:05:13.078
Now, over the past five years,

00:05:13.102 --> 00:05:15.527
I have worked with companies
all over the world

00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:17.162
to change their ways of working.

00:05:17.658 --> 00:05:20.979
And clearly, every company
has their own skeptics

00:05:21.003 --> 00:05:23.876
about why this is not
going to work for them.

00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:26.571
"Our product is more complex,"

00:05:26.595 --> 00:05:29.748
or "They don't have
the legacy IT like we do,"

00:05:29.772 --> 00:05:33.156
or "Regulators just won't allow this
in our industry."

00:05:34.323 --> 00:05:37.133
But for this bank and also
for the other companies

00:05:37.157 --> 00:05:38.841
that I have worked with afterwards,

00:05:38.865 --> 00:05:40.883
change was possible.

00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:45.400
Within a year, we completely
blew up the old silos

00:05:45.424 --> 00:05:48.414
between marketing,
product, channels and IT.

00:05:48.438 --> 00:05:54.511
Three thousand employees were reorganized
into 350 multidisciplinary teams.

00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:58.308
So instead of product people
sitting just with product people

00:05:58.332 --> 00:06:00.217
and engineers with engineers,

00:06:00.241 --> 00:06:04.321
a product person and an engineer
were now members of the same team.

00:06:04.927 --> 00:06:08.048
You could be a member of a team
responsible for account opening

00:06:08.072 --> 00:06:10.557
or for the mobile banking app, etc.

00:06:12.668 --> 00:06:15.001
At the go-live date
of that new organization,

00:06:15.691 --> 00:06:18.993
some people were shaking hands
for the very first time,

00:06:19.844 --> 00:06:24.106
only to find out that they had been
sitting two minutes away from each other

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.905
but they were sending each other emails
and status reports for the last 10 years.

00:06:29.815 --> 00:06:31.245
You would hear someone saying,

00:06:31.269 --> 00:06:34.653
"Ah, so you're the guy that I
was always chasing for answers."

00:06:34.677 --> 00:06:36.034
(Laughter)

00:06:36.058 --> 00:06:39.481
But now, they're having coffee
together every day.

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:43.230
If the product guy has an idea,
he can just raise it

00:06:43.254 --> 00:06:46.873
to get input from the engineer
who is sitting right next to him.

00:06:47.722 --> 00:06:51.353
They can decide to test
with customers immediately --

00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:54.950
no handovers, no PowerPoints, no red tape,

00:06:54.974 --> 00:06:57.049
just getting stuff done.

00:06:58.806 --> 00:07:00.930
Now, getting there is not easy.

00:07:01.636 --> 00:07:03.250
And as it turns out,

00:07:03.274 --> 00:07:04.950
"What are you willing to give up?"

00:07:04.974 --> 00:07:07.237
is exactly the right question to ask.

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:13.434
Autonomous decision-making
requires multidisciplinary teams.

00:07:13.458 --> 00:07:16.554
Instead of decisions going
up and down the organization,

00:07:16.578 --> 00:07:18.405
we want the team to decide.

00:07:18.429 --> 00:07:22.603
But to do so, we need all the skills
and expertise for that decision

00:07:22.627 --> 00:07:24.201
in the team.

00:07:24.225 --> 00:07:26.174
And this brings difficult trade-offs.

00:07:27.077 --> 00:07:30.974
Can we physically co-locate our people
who are working in different buildings,

00:07:30.998 --> 00:07:33.480
different cities or even
different countries today?

00:07:33.504 --> 00:07:35.966
Or should we invest
in better videoconferencing?

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.143
And how do we ensure consistency
in the way we do things

00:07:40.167 --> 00:07:41.468
across these teams?

00:07:42.092 --> 00:07:44.720
We still need some kind
of management matrix.

00:07:46.487 --> 00:07:52.216
Now, all these changes to structure
and process and procedure --

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.523
they are not easy.

00:07:54.515 --> 00:07:56.452
But in the end,

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:59.806
I found that the most
difficult thing to change

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.377
is our own behavior.

00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:04.394
Let me try to illustrate.

00:08:05.216 --> 00:08:09.519
If we want these teams to be fast,
flexible, creative, like a mini-start-up,

00:08:09.543 --> 00:08:12.556
they have to be empowered and autonomous.

00:08:13.321 --> 00:08:17.440
But this means we cannot have leaders
commanding their people what to do,

00:08:17.464 --> 00:08:19.290
when to do, how to do.

00:08:19.314 --> 00:08:20.781
No micromanagers.

00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:26.570
But it also means that each employee
needs to become a leader,

00:08:26.594 --> 00:08:28.746
regardless of their formal title.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:32.606
It's about all of us stepping up
to take initiative.

00:08:34.208 --> 00:08:37.115
Now obviously, we also cannot afford

00:08:37.139 --> 00:08:40.233
to have all these teams
running in different directions,

00:08:40.257 --> 00:08:43.093
because that would
certainly lead to chaos.

00:08:43.704 --> 00:08:48.482
So we need alignment and autonomy
at the same time,

00:08:48.506 --> 00:08:50.193
just like a flock of birds.

00:08:51.594 --> 00:08:53.871
In an organizational setting,

00:08:53.895 --> 00:08:55.665
this requires new behaviors,

00:08:55.689 --> 00:08:57.795
and with each new behavior,

00:08:57.819 --> 00:09:00.640
there is giving up
on something old as well.

00:09:01.751 --> 00:09:05.753
Leaders have to make sure
that everyone in the organization

00:09:05.777 --> 00:09:08.945
is aligned around
the overall purpose -- the why --

00:09:08.969 --> 00:09:11.257
and the overall priorities -- the what.

00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:15.089
But then they have to let go
and trust their teams

00:09:15.113 --> 00:09:18.211
to make the right decisions
on how to get there.

00:09:19.633 --> 00:09:24.968
Now, creating alignment requires
open and transparent communication.

00:09:24.992 --> 00:09:28.217
But you know how they say
that information is a source of power?

00:09:29.189 --> 00:09:30.909
Well, for some managers,

00:09:30.933 --> 00:09:35.434
sharing information may feel as if
they're giving up that source of power.

00:09:36.237 --> 00:09:38.288
And it's not just managers.

00:09:38.312 --> 00:09:41.857
The teams need to communicate
openly and transparently as well.

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:45.976
In these companies, the teams
typically work in short sprints,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.229
and at the end of every sprint,
they organize a demo session

00:09:49.253 --> 00:09:52.373
to share the output
of what they've done, transparently.

00:09:53.587 --> 00:09:55.237
And every day,

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:57.516
each member of the team gives an update

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.904
of what they are working on individually.

00:10:01.225 --> 00:10:05.992
Now, all this transparency
can be uncomfortable for people,

00:10:06.016 --> 00:10:09.975
because suddenly, there is
no place to hide anymore.

00:10:09.999 --> 00:10:13.568
Everything we do
is transparent for everyone.

00:10:14.867 --> 00:10:17.072
So, alignment is not easy,

00:10:17.096 --> 00:10:20.239
and providing autonomy
is not so obvious, either.

00:10:21.157 --> 00:10:23.127
One executive at another company

00:10:23.151 --> 00:10:27.666
likes to explain how he used to be
a master of milestone-tracking.

00:10:28.238 --> 00:10:32.115
Now, today, to know how things are going,

00:10:32.139 --> 00:10:34.205
instead of looking at status reports,

00:10:34.229 --> 00:10:38.576
he needs to walk down to the team floors
to attend one of their sessions.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.672
And instead of telling people what to do,

00:10:40.696 --> 00:10:42.459
he looks for ways to help them.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.770
That is radical change

00:10:44.794 --> 00:10:48.396
for someone who used to be
a master of milestone-tracking.

00:10:49.777 --> 00:10:52.338
But in the old world, this executive said,

00:10:52.362 --> 00:10:54.903
"I only had the illusion of control.

00:10:54.927 --> 00:11:00.476
In reality, many projects would run
over time and over budget, anyway.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.742
Now I have much more transparency,

00:11:02.766 --> 00:11:06.116
and I can course-correct
much earlier if needed."

00:11:07.228 --> 00:11:09.727
And middle managers
need to change as well.

00:11:10.201 --> 00:11:13.267
First of all, without the handovers
and the PowerPoint,

00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:15.839
there's less of a need
for middle managers.

00:11:15.863 --> 00:11:19.728
And in the old world, there was
this idea of thinkers and doers.

00:11:19.752 --> 00:11:21.940
Employees would just follow orders.

00:11:22.554 --> 00:11:26.364
But now, instead of only
managing other people,

00:11:26.388 --> 00:11:29.770
middle managers were expected
to become player-coaches.

00:11:30.408 --> 00:11:33.348
So imagine, for the last 10 years,

00:11:33.372 --> 00:11:36.135
you have just been telling
other people what to do,

00:11:36.159 --> 00:11:38.958
but now you're expected
to do things yourself again.

00:11:40.554 --> 00:11:42.531
Clearly, this model is not for everyone,

00:11:42.555 --> 00:11:45.084
and some great people leave the company.

00:11:45.609 --> 00:11:47.507
But the result is a new culture

00:11:47.531 --> 00:11:48.985
with less hierarchy.

00:11:50.813 --> 00:11:53.116
And all of this is hard work.

00:11:54.272 --> 00:11:55.806
But it's worth it.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.660
The companies that I worked with,

00:11:57.684 --> 00:12:01.983
they were used to deploying
new product features a few times per year.

00:12:02.007 --> 00:12:05.006
Now they have releases every few weeks,

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.489
and without the handovers
and the red tape,

00:12:07.513 --> 00:12:10.272
the whole organization
becomes more efficient.

00:12:10.296 --> 00:12:13.926
And finally, if you walk the halls
of these companies today,

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:16.142
you just feel a new energy.

00:12:16.166 --> 00:12:20.210
It feels as if you're walking
the halls of a very large start-up.

00:12:21.448 --> 00:12:25.330
Now, to be fair, these companies,
they cannot claim victory yet.

00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:28.032
But at least with this new model,

00:12:28.056 --> 00:12:31.615
they are much better prepared
to respond to change.

00:12:33.209 --> 00:12:36.321
The world is getting faster
and more complex,

00:12:36.345 --> 00:12:38.602
so we need to reboot our way of working.

00:12:39.382 --> 00:12:42.778
And the hardest part of that change
is not in structure

00:12:42.802 --> 00:12:45.427
or process or procedure,

00:12:45.451 --> 00:12:48.719
and it's also not just
senior executives taking charge.

00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:52.163
Leaders will be all of those
in the organization

00:12:52.187 --> 00:12:53.804
who embrace the change.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:56.495
We all have to lead the change.

00:12:57.732 --> 00:12:59.177
So the question is:

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:02.305
What are you willing to give up?

00:13:03.503 --> 00:13:04.675
Thank you.

00:13:04.699 --> 00:13:08.388
(Applause)
