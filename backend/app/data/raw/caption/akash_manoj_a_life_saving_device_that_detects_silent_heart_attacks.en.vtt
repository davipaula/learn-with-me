00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.102
When I was 13,

00:00:09.127 --> 00:00:11.967
I lost my grandfather
to a silent heart attack.

00:00:12.877 --> 00:00:16.866
What happened to be more
shocking was that at 75,

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.348
grandpa was really normal,
healthy and energetic,

00:00:21.372 --> 00:00:23.632
but he was diabetic.

00:00:24.347 --> 00:00:26.965
Learning all of this was so painful

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.999
that I decided to go out on a war
against this deadly killer

00:00:31.023 --> 00:00:32.499
and see what could be done.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:36.929
It was shocking to discover
the results of recent studies

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:40.725
that have shown an estimate
of nearly eight million people

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.616
who die from heart attacks every year.

00:00:44.354 --> 00:00:46.912
Heart attacks occur for many reasons,

00:00:46.936 --> 00:00:51.517
but most often, they occur
when arteries get clogged,

00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:53.015
blood flow is cut off

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.280
and oxygen-starved cells
in the heart muscles start to die.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.181
You may know the common
symptoms of a heart attack:

00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:06.340
chest pain, arm pain, shortness
of breath, fatigue, et cetera ...

00:01:06.364 --> 00:01:10.422
but there is a type of heart attack
that is quite common,

00:01:10.446 --> 00:01:11.915
just as deadly,

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:15.674
but harder to detect
because the symptoms are silent.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.554
People having silent heart attacks
just don't realize what's happening,

00:01:22.578 --> 00:01:25.473
so they're not seeking medical attention,

00:01:25.497 --> 00:01:30.422
which means they're less likely
to receive the treatment that they need

00:01:30.446 --> 00:01:31.899
at the critical moment.

00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:36.297
And even if they do
get to the hospital by chance,

00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:40.057
either before or after
they are struck by a heart attack,

00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:45.732
they might have to go through one or more
of these time-consuming, expensive tests

00:01:45.756 --> 00:01:46.907
and treatments,

00:01:46.931 --> 00:01:49.413
which are currently considered
the gold standards

00:01:49.437 --> 00:01:51.206
of heart-attack diagnosis.

00:01:51.648 --> 00:01:53.565
The greater concern, however,

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:57.729
is that these silent heart attacks
account for nearly 45 percent

00:01:57.753 --> 00:01:59.177
of all heart attacks.

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:04.478
Patients with diabetes and similar
disorders suffer from nerve damage

00:02:04.502 --> 00:02:07.795
that prevents them from feeling
the sort of pain

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:10.294
that usually signals to someone

00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:14.021
that he or she may be having
a heart attack.

00:02:15.774 --> 00:02:18.969
Which means they suffer
the damage of a heart attack

00:02:18.993 --> 00:02:21.900
without even knowing or feeling anything.

00:02:23.152 --> 00:02:28.859
These already at-risk patients
suffer from nerve damage,

00:02:28.883 --> 00:02:32.103
and they do not get
immediate medical care.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.990
They do not know anything before
an unlikely event is about to occur.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.460
My grandfather
was an at-risk patient, too.

00:02:42.857 --> 00:02:45.341
I probed this issue further --

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:48.206
read as much as I could
to understand the heart,

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.919
met researchers
and worked across labs in India.

00:02:52.757 --> 00:02:57.204
And finally, after three long years
of persistent research,

00:02:57.228 --> 00:03:01.227
what I have to share with the world today
is a promising solution.

00:03:02.241 --> 00:03:05.879
A noninvasive device that is inexpensive,

00:03:05.903 --> 00:03:11.395
portable, wearable by at-risk
patients at all times.

00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:15.187
It greatly reduces
the need for a blood test

00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:21.200
and works 24/7, collecting
and analyzing data at preset intervals.

00:03:21.782 --> 00:03:25.552
And all this data is collected
for a single purpose:

00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:28.227
detecting heart attacks as they occur.

00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:34.433
This is a very promising solution
that might help us in the future.

00:03:35.604 --> 00:03:38.881
You may not know how intelligent
your heart really is.

00:03:39.923 --> 00:03:44.943
It tries to communicate to your body
multiple times before failing,

00:03:44.967 --> 00:03:47.429
by indicating symptoms like chest pain.

00:03:48.335 --> 00:03:52.100
These symptoms are triggered
when the heart loses out

00:03:52.124 --> 00:03:54.252
on oxygen-rich blood flow.

00:03:55.107 --> 00:03:57.761
But remember I told you
about the nerve damage.

00:03:58.323 --> 00:04:02.467
It silences these symptoms
before a silent heart attack,

00:04:03.565 --> 00:04:06.040
which makes it even deadlier.

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.334
And you may not even know
the common symptoms.

00:04:12.243 --> 00:04:16.616
Meanwhile, the heart also sends out
certain biomarkers --

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.813
cardiac biomarkers or proteins
that are SOS messages --

00:04:21.837 --> 00:04:23.639
in the form of SOS messages --

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:25.242
into your bloodstream,

00:04:25.266 --> 00:04:27.880
indicating that the heart is at risk.

00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:30.584
As it gets riskier and riskier,

00:04:30.608 --> 00:04:34.188
the concentrations
of these cardiac biomarker proteins

00:04:34.212 --> 00:04:36.112
keep increasing abysmally.

00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:39.514
My device solely relies on this data.

00:04:40.423 --> 00:04:43.806
The key is that these cardiac
biomarkers are found

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.603
in one of the earliest
stages of a heart attack,

00:04:46.627 --> 00:04:50.138
when someone is almost sure to survive

00:04:50.162 --> 00:04:53.302
if he or she gets prompt care.

00:04:54.102 --> 00:04:58.125
And my device is solely based
on that basis.

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.941
And here's how my device works.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.848
A silicon patch is worn around your wrist
or placed near your chest.

00:05:06.743 --> 00:05:11.603
Without having to prick your skin
for a biomarker blood test,

00:05:11.627 --> 00:05:18.335
this patch can spot, isolate and track
a heart-attack specific biomarker

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:20.440
called H-FABP,

00:05:20.464 --> 00:05:26.126
and alerts you if and when it reaches
a critical level in your bloodstream --

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.819
a process that's much simpler, easier
and cheaper than conventional methods

00:05:32.153 --> 00:05:34.030
of heart-attack diagnosis.

00:05:35.687 --> 00:05:39.147
By checking on biomarker
concentration data,

00:05:40.242 --> 00:05:44.338
a system like this,
with advanced research in the future,

00:05:44.362 --> 00:05:48.794
could significantly reduce the need
for an at-risk patient to go to a doctor

00:05:48.818 --> 00:05:50.156
for a biomarker blood test,

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.514
because the device
could be worn at all times,

00:05:53.538 --> 00:05:56.671
sensing biomarker elevations in real time.

00:05:57.813 --> 00:06:03.020
Thus, if the device senses the biomarker
levels going beyond the critical point,

00:06:03.044 --> 00:06:07.525
the at-risk patient could be warned
of an impending cardiac arrest

00:06:07.549 --> 00:06:10.335
and that he or she needs
immediate medical attention.

00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:14.753
Although the device may not be able
to provide the patient

00:06:14.777 --> 00:06:17.723
with the complete analysis
of the cardiac injury,

00:06:17.747 --> 00:06:19.841
it might be of immense help

00:06:19.865 --> 00:06:23.747
in actually indicating
that the patient is in danger,

00:06:23.771 --> 00:06:25.843
so that the patient can be alarmed

00:06:25.867 --> 00:06:28.999
and know that immediate care is crucial.

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:34.741
Every at-risk patient will now receive
more time to survive

00:06:34.765 --> 00:06:36.349
and reach out for medical help.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.624
Consequently, they don't have to go

00:06:39.648 --> 00:06:42.942
for expensive and invasive
medical treatments

00:06:42.966 --> 00:06:45.858
that would otherwise be necessary
after a heart attack.

00:06:47.278 --> 00:06:51.111
When I got my device tested
on at-risk patients under observation,

00:06:51.135 --> 00:06:54.120
results from the clinical validation tests

00:06:54.144 --> 00:06:58.244
certified close to a 96 percent
accuracy and sensitivity.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.673
I intend to make my device available
to people in two variants:

00:07:03.697 --> 00:07:07.721
one which gives digital analysis
of the biomarker levels

00:07:07.745 --> 00:07:10.302
and a simpler version
for the people in rural areas

00:07:10.326 --> 00:07:14.031
which simply vibrates when the biomarker
levels go beyond the critical point.

00:07:15.346 --> 00:07:18.723
When we look at our progress
in cardiac health care today,

00:07:18.747 --> 00:07:22.852
it is more of sick care than preventative
self-care and technology.

00:07:23.724 --> 00:07:26.064
We literally wait
for the heart attack to occur

00:07:26.088 --> 00:07:29.852
and put our vast majority of resources
into post-care treatment.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.316
But by then, irreversible damage
will already be done.

00:07:35.565 --> 00:07:38.880
I firmly believe it's time
for us to rethink medicine.

00:07:39.385 --> 00:07:42.257
We must establish proactive
health-care technologies.

00:07:42.679 --> 00:07:45.524
A change must be brought out
not 10 years from now,

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:46.847
not five years from now,

00:07:46.871 --> 00:07:48.026
but today.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:50.439
And so, hopefully, one day,

00:07:50.463 --> 00:07:52.229
with the help of these devices,

00:07:52.253 --> 00:07:56.765
someone else won't lose
his or her grandfather just like I did.

00:07:56.789 --> 00:07:58.039
Thank you so much.

00:07:58.063 --> 00:07:59.524
(Applause)

00:07:59.548 --> 00:08:01.421
Thank you.

00:08:01.445 --> 00:08:03.452
(Applause)

00:08:03.476 --> 00:08:04.626
Thank you.
