00:00:06.862 --> 00:00:10.402
The Vikings came from the rugged, 
inhospitable north

00:00:10.402 --> 00:00:13.015
known today as Scandinavia.

00:00:13.015 --> 00:00:15.975
As the Roman Empire 
flourished further south,

00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:21.703
Scandinavians had small settlements, 
no central government, and no coinage.

00:00:21.703 --> 00:00:23.473
Yet by the 11th century,

00:00:23.473 --> 00:00:26.725
the Vikings 
had spread far from Scandinavia,

00:00:26.725 --> 00:00:29.395
gaining control of trade routes 
throughout Europe,

00:00:29.395 --> 00:00:31.925
conquering kingdoms as far as Africa,

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:35.704
and even building outposts 
in North America.

00:00:35.704 --> 00:00:39.215
The secret to their success 
was their ships.

00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:41.365
The formidable Viking longship

00:00:41.365 --> 00:00:45.979
had its origins 
in the humble dugout canoe, or log boat.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:47.039
For millennia,

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.495
the inhabitants of Scandinavia 
had used these canoes for transportation.

00:00:51.495 --> 00:00:55.848
Dense forests and tall mountains 
made overland travel difficult,

00:00:55.848 --> 00:01:00.178
but long coastlines 
and numerous rivers, lakes, and fjords

00:01:00.178 --> 00:01:02.753
provided a viable alternative.

00:01:02.753 --> 00:01:07.219
The first canoes were simply hollowed out 
logs rowed with paddles.

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:10.289
Over time, they added planks 
to the log boat base

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.199
using the clinker, 
or "lapstrake," technique,

00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:15.015
meaning the planks overlapped

00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:18.539
and were fastened to each other 
along their edges.

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:21.099
As the Roman Empire expanded north,

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:24.699
some Scandinavians 
served in their new neighbors’ armies—

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:28.029
and brought home 
Roman maritime technology.

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:30.929
The Mediterranean cultures 
at the heart of the Roman Empire

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:33.789
had large warships 
that controlled the sea,

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.259
and cargo ships that transported goods 
along the waterways.

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.173
These ships were powered by sail and oars

00:01:41.173 --> 00:01:44.829
and relied on a strong skeleton 
of internal timbers

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.989
fastened to the outer planks 
with copper, iron, and wood nails.

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:53.539
At first, Scandinavians 
incorporated this new technology

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.029
by replacing their loose paddles 
with anchored oars.

00:01:57.029 --> 00:02:00.179
This change 
hugely improved the crew’s efficiency,

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.879
but also required stronger ships.

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:08.051
So boat builders began to use iron nails 
for fasteners rather than sewing.

00:02:08.051 --> 00:02:11.551
They abandoned 
the log boat base for a keel plank,

00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:14.980
and the boats became higher 
and more seaworthy.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.480
But these early ships retained the concept
of the original log boat:

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.800
their strength 
depended on the outer shell of wood,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.580
not internal frames and beams.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.960
They were built as shells— 
thin-walled but strong,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.910
and much lighter than the Roman ships.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.266
Competing chieftains quickly refined 
the new ships to be even more efficient.

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:40.386
The lighter the boat, 
the more versatile it would be

00:02:40.386 --> 00:02:43.910
and the less investment of resources 
it would require—

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.320
an essential advantage 
in a decentralized culture

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.580
without large supplies of people.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.346
These ships still had no sails— 
sails were costly,

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:57.446
and for now the rowed ships 
could meet their needs.

00:02:57.446 --> 00:03:00.476
That changed 
after the Western Roman Empire

00:03:00.476 --> 00:03:02.616
collapsed in the 5th century.

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:05.306
Western Europe 
took a heavy economic blow,

00:03:05.306 --> 00:03:08.546
leveling the playing field a bit 
for the Scandinavians.

00:03:08.546 --> 00:03:10.296
As the region revived,

00:03:10.296 --> 00:03:15.020
new and vigorous trade routes 
extended into and through Scandinavia.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.420
The wealth that flowed along these routes

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.425
helped create a new, more prosperous 
and powerful class of Scandinavians,

00:03:22.425 --> 00:03:25.485
whose members 
competed constantly with each other

00:03:25.485 --> 00:03:28.216
over trade routes and territory.

00:03:28.216 --> 00:03:32.391
By the 8th century, 
a sailing ship began to make sense:

00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:36.922
it could go further, faster, 
in search of newly available plunder.

00:03:36.922 --> 00:03:38.512
With the addition of sails,

00:03:38.512 --> 00:03:43.209
the already light and speedy ships 
became nearly unbeatable.

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.949
The Viking ship was born.

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:50.723
Viking longships could soon carry 
as many as 100 Vikings to battle.

00:03:50.723 --> 00:03:53.323
Fleets of them 
could land on open beaches,

00:03:53.323 --> 00:03:58.596
penetrate deep into river systems, 
and be moved over land if need be.

00:03:58.596 --> 00:03:59.766
When not at war,

00:03:59.766 --> 00:04:04.021
the vessels were used to transport goods 
and make trade journeys.

00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:07.708
There were smaller versions 
for fishing and local excursions,

00:04:07.708 --> 00:04:10.964
and larger adaptations 
for open sea voyages

00:04:10.964 --> 00:04:14.484
capable of carrying 
tens of tons of cargo.

00:04:14.484 --> 00:04:17.514
Thanks to their inventiveness 
in the face of difficult terrain

00:04:17.514 --> 00:04:21.074
and weak economies, 
the Vikings sailed west,

00:04:21.074 --> 00:04:24.874
settled the North Atlantic 
and explored the North American coast

00:04:24.874 --> 00:04:28.916
centuries before any other Europeans 
would set foot there.
