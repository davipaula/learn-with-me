00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.416
This is me at five years old,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.960
shortly before jumping
into this beautifully still pool of water.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.176
I soon find out the hard way
that this pool is completely empty

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.896
because the ice-cold water
is near freezing

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.200
and literally takes my breath away.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.256
Even though I already know how to swim,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.440
I can't get up to the water's surface,
no matter how hard I try.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.520
That's the last thing I remember
trying to do before blacking out.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.776
Turns out, the lifeguard on duty
had been chatting with two girls

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.376
when I jumped in,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.296
and I was soon underwater,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.256
so he couldn't actually
see or hear me struggle.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.856
I was eventually saved
by a girl walking near the pool

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.120
who happened to look down and see me.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.816
The next thing I know,
I'm getting mouth-to-mouth

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.960
and being rushed to the hospital
to determine the extent of my brain loss.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.376
If I had been flailing
at the water's surface,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.640
the lifeguard would have noticed
and come to save me.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.456
I share this near-death experience
because it illustrates

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.720
how dangerous things are
when they're just beneath the surface.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.616
Today, I study implicit
gender bias in start-ups,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.176
which I consider to be
far more insidious than mere overt bias

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.800
for this very same reason.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.496
When we see or hear an investor

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.856
behaving inappropriately
towards an entrepreneur,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.816
we're aware of the problem

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.680
and at least have a chance
to do something about it.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.376
But what if there are subtle differences

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.720
in the interactions
between investors and entrepreneurs

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.936
that can affect their outcomes,

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.056
differences that we're not conscious of,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.160
that we can't directly see or hear?

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.216
Before studying start-ups
at Columbia Business School,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.656
I spent five years running
and raising money for my own start-up.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.976
I remember constantly racing around
to meet with prospective investors

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.735
while trying to manage my actual business.

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:23.656
At one point I joked
that I had reluctantly pitched

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.456
each and every family member,
friend, colleague, angel investor

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.680
and VC this side of the Mississippi.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.296
Well, in the process of speaking
to all these investors,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.536
I noticed something
interesting was happening.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.936
I was getting asked a very different
set of questions than my male cofounder.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.376
I got asked just about everything
that could go wrong with the venture

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.536
to induce investor losses,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.376
while my male cofounder was asked
about our venture's home run potential

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.776
to maximize investor gains,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.656
essentially everything
that could go right with the venture.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.856
He got asked how many new customers
we were going to bring on,

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.816
while I got asked how we were going
to hang on to the ones we already had.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.216
Well, as the CEO of the company,
I found this to be rather odd.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.080
In fact, I felt like
I was taking crazy pills.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.416
But I eventually
rationalized it by thinking,

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.896
maybe this has to do
with how I'm presenting myself,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.480
or it's something
simply unique to my start-up.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.256
Well, years later I made the difficult
decision to leave my start-up

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.176
so I could pursue a lifelong dream
of getting my PhD.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.496
It was at Columbia that I learned
about a social psychological theory

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.976
originated by Professor Tory Higgins
called "regulatory focus,"

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.896
which differentiates between
two distinct motivational orientations

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.480
of promotion and prevention.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.936
A promotion focus is concerned with gains

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.096
and emphasizes hopes, accomplishments
and advancement needs,

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.776
while a prevention focus
is concerned with losses

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.480
and emphasizes safety,
responsibility and security needs.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.256
Since the best-case scenario
for a prevention focus

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.096
is to simply maintain the status quo,

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.776
this has us treading water
just to stay afloat,

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.616
while a promotion focus instead
has us swimming in the right direction.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.640
It's just a matter
of how far we can advance.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.896
Well, I had my very own eureka moment
when it dawned on me

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.376
that this concept of promotion

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.936
sounded a lot like the questions
posed to my male cofounder,

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.920
while prevention resembled
those questions asked of me.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.696
As an entrepreneurship scholar,

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.976
I started digging into the research
on start-up financing

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.336
and discovered there's an enormous gap

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.400
between the amount of funds
that male and female founders raise.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.560
Although women found
38 percent of US companies,

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.640
they only get two percent
of the venture funding.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.656
I got to thinking:

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.656
what if this funding gap is not due
to any fundamental difference

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.800
in the businesses
started by men and women?

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.776
What if women get less funding than men

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.200
due to a simple difference
in the questions that they get asked?

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.736
After all, when it comes
to venture funding,

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.136
entrepreneurs need to convince investors
of their start-up's home run potential.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.976
It's not enough to merely demonstrate

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.296
you're not going to lose
your investors' money.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.656
So it makes sense that women
would be getting less funding than men

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.936
if they're engaging

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.776
in prevention as opposed to
promotion-oriented dialogues.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.336
Well, I got the chance
to test this hypothesis

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.416
on companies with similar quality
and funding needs across all years

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.856
at the funding competition
known as TechCrunch Disrupt

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.576
Startup Battlefield has run
in New York City

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.920
since its inception in 2010.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.016
TechCrunch is widely regarded as
the ideal place for start-ups to launch,

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.536
with participants including start-ups
that have since become household names,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.496
like Dropbox, Fitbit and Mint,

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.280
presenting to some of the world's
most prominent VCs.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.136
Well, despite the comparability
of companies in my sample,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.856
male-led start-ups went on
to raise five times as much funding

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.200
as the female-led ones.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.400
This made me especially curious to see
what's driving this gender disparity.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.656
Well, it took a while,

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.216
but I got my hands on all the videos of
both the pitches and the Q and A sessions

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.840
from TechCrunch,
and I had them transcribed.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.456
I first analyzed the transcripts

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.136
by loading a dictionary
of regulatory-focused terms

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.216
into the Linguistic Inquiry
and Word Count software called LIWC.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.856
This LIWC software
generated the frequencies

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.896
of promotion and prevention words
in the transcribed text.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.416
As a second method,

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.376
I had each of the questions
and answers manually coded

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.200
by the Tory Higgins
Research Lab at Columbia.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.936
Regardless of the topic at hand,

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.816
an intention can be framed
in promotion or prevention.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.400
Let's take that topic of customers
I mentioned briefly earlier.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.416
A promotion-coded question sounds like,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.776
"How many new customers
do you plan to acquire this year?"

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.016
while a prevention-coded one sounds like,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.360
"How do you plan to retain
your existing customers?"

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.576
During the same time,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.016
I also gathered background information

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.096
on the start-ups and entrepreneurs
that can affect their funding outcomes,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.176
like the start-up's age,
quality and funding needs

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.376
and the entrepreneur's past experience,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.040
so I could use these data points
as controls in my analysis.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.976
Well, the very first thing that I found

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.616
is that there's no difference in the way
entrepreneurs present their companies.

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.736
In other words, both male
and female entrepreneurs

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.056
use similar degrees
of promotion and prevention language

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:41.976
in their actual pitches.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.016
So having ruled out this difference
on the entrepreneur's side,

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.336
I then moved on to the investor's side,

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.056
analyzing the six minutes of Q&amp;A sessions

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.320
that entrepreneurs engaged in
with the VCs after pitching.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.336
When examining the nearly 2,000 questions

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.960
and corresponding answers
in these exchanges,

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.456
both of my methods
showed significant support

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.256
for the fact that male entrepreneurs
get asked promotion questions

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.200
and female entrepreneurs
get asked prevention questions.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:17.176
In fact, a whopping 67 percent
of the questions posed

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.696
to male entrepreneurs
were promotion-focused,

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.320
while 66 percent of those posed to female
entrepreneurs were prevention-focused.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.176
What's especially interesting

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.616
is that I expected female VCs

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.320
to behave similarly to male VCs.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.736
Given its prevalence in the popular media
and the venture-funding literature,

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.176
I expected the birds-of-a-feather
theory of homophily to hold here,

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.456
meaning that male VCs
would favor male entrepreneurs

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.216
with promotion questions

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.880
and female VCs would do the same
for female entrepreneurs.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:59.056
But instead, all VCs displayed
the same implicit gender bias

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.656
manifested in the regulatory focus
of the questions they posed

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.720
to male versus female candidates.

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.496
So female VCs asked
male entrepreneurs promotion questions

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.176
and then turned around and asked
female entrepreneurs prevention questions

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.840
just like the male VCs did.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.496
So given the fact
that both male and female VCs

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.576
are displaying this implicit gender bias,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.480
what effect, if any, does this have
on start-up funding outcomes?

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.560
My research shows
it has a significant effect.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.816
The regulatory focus of investor questions

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.496
not only predicted
how well the start-ups would perform

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.176
at the TechCrunch Disrupt competitions

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.560
but also how much funding the start-ups
went on to raise in the open market.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.936
Those start-ups who were asked
predominantly promotion questions

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.056
went on to raise
seven times as much funding

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.040
as those asked prevention questions.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.056
But I didn't stop there.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:01.736
I then moved on to analyze entrepreneurs'
responses to those questions,

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:05.696
and I found that entrepreneurs
are apt to respond in kind

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.296
to the questions they get,

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.456
meaning a promotion question
begets a promotion response

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.616
and a prevention question
begets a prevention response.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.456
Now, this might make
intuitive sense to all of us here,

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.880
but it has some unfortunate consequences
in this context of venture funding.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.056
So what ends up happening

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.416
is that a male entrepreneur
gets asked a promotion question,

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.096
granting him the luxury
to reinforce his association

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.216
with the favorable domain
of gains by responding in kind,

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.576
while a female entrepreneur
gets asked a prevention question

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.376
and inadvertently
aggravates her association

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:45.496
with the unfavorable domain
of losses by doing so.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:50.096
These responses then trigger venture
capitalists' subsequent biased questions,

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.136
and the questions and answers
collectively fuel a cycle of bias

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.176
that merely perpetuates
the gender disparity.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.760
Pretty depressing stuff, right?

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.080
Well, fortunately, there's
a silver lining to my findings.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:07.576
Those plucky entrepreneurs
who managed to switch focus

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.696
by responding to prevention questions
with promotion answers

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.976
went on to raise 14 times more funding

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.256
than those who responded
to prevention questions

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.520
with prevention answers.

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.336
So what this means
is that if you're asked a question

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.136
about defending
your start-up's market share,

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.816
you'd be better served
to frame your response

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.736
around the size and growth potential
of the overall pie

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.016
as opposed to how you merely plan
to protect your sliver of that pie.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.936
So if I get asked this question,

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.216
I would say,

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.976
"We're playing in such a large
and fast-growing market

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.416
that's bound to attract new entrants.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.616
We plan to take
increasing share in this market

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.216
by leveraging our start-up's
unique assets."

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:55.600
I've thus subtly redirected this dialogue
into the favorable domain of gains.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.576
Now, these results are quite compelling
among start-ups that launched at TechCrunch

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.576
but field data can merely tell us
that there's a correlational relationship

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.016
between regulatory focus and funding.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.896
So I sought to see whether
this difference in regulatory focus

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.536
can actually cause funding outcomes

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.776
by running a controlled experiment

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.160
on both angel investors
and ordinary people.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.536
Simulating the TechCrunch
Disrupt environment,

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.816
I had participants listen
to four six-minute audio files

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.536
of 10 question-and-answer exchanges

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.816
that were manipulated
for promotion and prevention language,

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.079
and then asked them
to allocate a sum of funding

00:12:34.103 --> 00:12:35.863
to each venture as they saw fit.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.976
Well, my experimental results
reinforced my findings from the field.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.976
Those scenarios where entrepreneurs
were asked promotion questions

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.536
received twice the funding allocations

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.440
of those where entrepreneurs
were asked prevention questions.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.456
What's especially promising

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.896
is the fact that those scenarios
where entrepreneurs switched

00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.576
as opposed to matched focus
when they received prevention questions

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:04.840
received significantly more funding
from both sets of participants.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.856
So to my female entrepreneurs out there,

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.576
here are a couple
simple things you could do.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.976
The first is to recognize
the question you're being asked.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.776
Are you getting a prevention question?

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.896
If this is the case, answer
the question at hand by all means,

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.656
but merely frame
your response in promotion

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.880
in an effort to garner higher amounts
of funding for your start-ups.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.336
The unfortunate reality, though,

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.256
is that both men and women
evaluating start-ups

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.856
display the same implicit
gender bias in their questioning,

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.320
inadvertently favoring
male entrepreneurs over female ones.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.456
So to my investors out there,

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.296
I would offer that you have
an opportunity here

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.816
to approach Q&amp;A sessions
more even-handedly,

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.296
not just so that you
could do the right thing,

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.280
but so that you can improve
the quality of your decision making.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.176
By flashing the same light
on every start-up's potential

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.056
for gains and losses,

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.016
you enable all deserving
start-ups to shine

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.600
and you maximize returns in the process.

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.936
Today, I get to be that girl

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.936
walking by the pool,

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.496
sounding the alarm

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.120
that something is going on
beneath the surface.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:26.776
Together, we have the power
to break this cycle

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.240
of implicit gender bias
in start-up funding.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.016
Let's give the most promising start-ups,

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.376
regardless of whether
they're led by men or women,

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.136
a fighting chance to grow and thrive.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.456
Thank you.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:47.040
(Applause)
