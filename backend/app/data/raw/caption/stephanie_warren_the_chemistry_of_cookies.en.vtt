00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:10.683
In a time-lapse video,
it looks like a monster coming alive.

00:00:10.707 --> 00:00:13.595
For a moment, it sits there innocuously.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.172
Then, ripples move across its surface.

00:00:16.196 --> 00:00:19.563
It bulges outwards,
bursting with weird boils.

00:00:19.587 --> 00:00:21.195
It triples in volume.

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:24.772
Its color darkens ominously,
and its surface hardens

00:00:24.796 --> 00:00:28.777
into an alien topography
of peaks and craters.

00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:30.741
Then, the kitchen timer dings.

00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:32.116
Your cookie is ready.

00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:33.904
What happened inside that oven?

00:00:33.928 --> 00:00:35.817
Don't let the apron deceive you!

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:38.205
Bakers are mad scientists.

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:40.040
When you slide the pan into the oven,

00:00:40.064 --> 00:00:42.589
you're setting off a series
of chemical reactions

00:00:42.613 --> 00:00:47.344
that transform one substance, dough,
into another, cookies.

00:00:47.368 --> 00:00:50.289
When the dough reaches
92 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:00:50.313 --> 00:00:51.768
the butter inside melts,

00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:54.017
causing the dough to start spreading out.

00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:55.518
Butter is an emulsion,

00:00:55.542 --> 00:00:57.107
or mixture of two substances

00:00:57.131 --> 00:00:58.985
that don't want to stay together,

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:01.014
in this case, water and fat,

00:01:01.038 --> 00:01:04.188
along with some dairy solids
that help hold them together.

00:01:04.212 --> 00:01:07.400
As the butter melts,
its trapped water is released.

00:01:07.424 --> 00:01:10.695
And as the cookie gets hotter,
the water expands into steam.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:13.196
It pushes against the dough
from the inside,

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.654
trying to escape through the cookie walls

00:01:15.678 --> 00:01:18.222
like Ridley Scott's chest-bursting alien.

00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:22.333
Your eggs may have been home
to squirming salmonella bacteria.

00:01:22.357 --> 00:01:27.319
An estimated 142,000 Americans
are infected this way each year.

00:01:27.343 --> 00:01:30.147
Though salmonella can live for weeks
outside a living body

00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:31.764
and even survive freezing,

00:01:31.788 --> 00:01:35.385
136 degrees is too hot for them.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.093
When your dough reaches
that temperature, they die off.

00:01:38.117 --> 00:01:41.179
You'll live to test your fate
with a bite of raw dough

00:01:41.203 --> 00:01:42.888
you sneak from your next batch.

00:01:43.594 --> 00:01:47.069
At 144 degrees,
changes begin in the proteins,

00:01:47.093 --> 00:01:49.489
which come mostly
from the eggs in your dough.

00:01:49.513 --> 00:01:52.460
Eggs are composed of dozens
of different kinds of proteins,

00:01:52.484 --> 00:01:55.016
each sensitive to a different temperature.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.780
In an egg fresh from the hen,

00:01:56.804 --> 00:01:59.731
these proteins look
like coiled up balls of string.

00:01:59.755 --> 00:02:01.571
When they're exposed to heat energy,

00:02:01.595 --> 00:02:05.813
the protein strings unfold
and get tangled up with their neighbors.

00:02:05.837 --> 00:02:07.290
This linked structure

00:02:07.314 --> 00:02:09.197
makes the runny egg nearly solid,

00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:11.824
giving substance to squishy dough.

00:02:11.848 --> 00:02:14.725
Water boils away at 212 degrees,

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:16.474
so like mud baking in the sun,

00:02:16.498 --> 00:02:19.368
your cookie gets dried out
and it stiffens.

00:02:19.392 --> 00:02:21.351
Cracks spread across its surface.

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:24.112
The steam that was bubbling
inside evaporates,

00:02:24.136 --> 00:02:27.776
leaving behind airy pockets
that make the cookie light and flaky.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.848
Helping this along
is your leavening agent,

00:02:29.872 --> 00:02:31.356
sodium bicarbonate,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.576
or baking soda.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.575
The sodium bicarbonate reacts
with acids in the dough

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.116
to create carbon dioxide gas,
which makes airy pockets in your cookie.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.628
Now, it's nearly ready
for a refreshing dunk

00:02:42.652 --> 00:02:44.667
in a cool glass of milk.

00:02:44.691 --> 00:02:47.496
One of science's tastiest reactions

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.882
occurs at 310 degrees.

00:02:49.906 --> 00:02:52.497
This is the temperature
for Maillard reactions.

00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:53.989
Maillard reactions result

00:02:54.013 --> 00:02:57.611
when proteins and sugars break down
and rearrange themselves,

00:02:57.635 --> 00:02:59.134
forming ring-like structures,

00:02:59.158 --> 00:03:00.525
which reflect light in a way

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.680
that gives foods like Thanksgiving turkey

00:03:02.704 --> 00:03:03.764
and hamburgers

00:03:03.788 --> 00:03:06.262
their distinctive, rich brown color.

00:03:06.867 --> 00:03:08.099
As this reaction occurs,

00:03:08.123 --> 00:03:11.009
it produces a range of flavor
and aroma compounds,

00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:12.677
which also react with each other,

00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:15.698
forming even more complex
tastes and smells.

00:03:16.508 --> 00:03:18.393
Caramelization is the last reaction

00:03:18.417 --> 00:03:20.370
to take place inside your cookie.

00:03:20.394 --> 00:03:22.185
Caramelization is what happens

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.953
when sugar molecules
break down under high heat,

00:03:25.977 --> 00:03:27.670
forming the sweet, nutty,

00:03:27.694 --> 00:03:32.013
and slightly bitter flavor compounds
that define, well, caramel.

00:03:32.037 --> 00:03:35.515
And, in fact, if your recipe
calls for a 350 degree oven,

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:36.994
it'll never happen,

00:03:37.018 --> 00:03:40.931
since caramelization
starts at 356 degrees.

00:03:40.955 --> 00:03:43.347
If your ideal cookie is barely browned,

00:03:43.371 --> 00:03:45.599
like a Northeasterner on a beach vacation,

00:03:45.623 --> 00:03:48.478
you could have set
your oven to 310 degrees.

00:03:48.502 --> 00:03:50.761
If you like your cookies
to have a nice tan,

00:03:50.785 --> 00:03:51.876
crank up the heat.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.698
Caramelization continues
up to 390 degrees.

00:03:55.722 --> 00:03:56.913
And here's another trick:

00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:58.931
you don't need that kitchen timer;

00:03:58.955 --> 00:04:01.890
your nose is a sensitive
scientific instrument.

00:04:01.914 --> 00:04:04.284
When you smell the nutty, toasty aromas

00:04:04.308 --> 00:04:07.031
of the Maillard reaction
and caramelization,

00:04:07.055 --> 00:04:08.387
your cookies are ready.

00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:09.701
Grab your glass of milk,

00:04:09.725 --> 00:04:10.793
put your feet up,

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:14.601
and reflect that science
can be pretty sweet.
