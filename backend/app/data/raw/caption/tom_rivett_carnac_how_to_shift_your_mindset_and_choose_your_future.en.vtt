Reviewer: Camille MartÃ­nez

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.113
I never thought that I would be giving 
my TED Talk somewhere like this.

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:19.806
But, like half of humanity,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.780
I've spent the last
four weeks under lockdown

00:00:22.804 --> 00:00:26.394
due to the global pandemic
created by COVID-19.

00:00:27.113 --> 00:00:29.722
I am extremely fortunate
that during this time

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:34.035
I've been able to come here to these woods
near my home in southern England.

00:00:34.512 --> 00:00:36.863
These woods have always inspired me,

00:00:36.887 --> 00:00:41.774
and as humanity now tries to think about
how we can find the inspiration

00:00:41.798 --> 00:00:44.124
to retake control of our actions

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:46.782
so that terrible things
don't come down the road

00:00:46.806 --> 00:00:49.440
without us taking action to avert them,

00:00:49.464 --> 00:00:52.347
I thought this is a good place
for us to talk.

00:00:52.914 --> 00:00:56.285
And I'd like to begin
that story six years ago,

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.278
when I had first joined
the United Nations.

00:00:59.987 --> 00:01:04.281
Now, I firmly believe
that the UN is of unparalleled importance

00:01:04.305 --> 00:01:05.856
in the world right now

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.457
to promote collaboration and cooperation.

00:01:09.278 --> 00:01:11.325
But what they don't tell you when you join

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:13.873
is that this essential work is delivered

00:01:13.897 --> 00:01:17.338
mainly in the form
of extremely boring meetings --

00:01:17.362 --> 00:01:20.286
extremely long, boring meetings.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.466
Now, you may feel that you have attended
some long, boring meetings in your life,

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.728
and I'm sure you have.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.844
But these UN meetings are next-level,

00:01:27.868 --> 00:01:31.307
and everyone who works there
approaches them with a level of calm

00:01:31.331 --> 00:01:33.766
normally only achieved by Zen masters.

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:36.103
But myself, I wasn't ready for that.

00:01:36.127 --> 00:01:39.836
I joined expecting drama
and tension and breakthrough.

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:41.811
What I wasn't ready for

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:45.382
was a process that seemed to move
at the speed of a glacier,

00:01:45.406 --> 00:01:48.153
at the speed that a glacier
used to move at.

00:01:49.074 --> 00:01:51.421
Now, in the middle
of one of these long meetings,

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:52.803
I was handed a note.

00:01:52.827 --> 00:01:56.269
And it was handed to me
by my friend and colleague and coauthor,

00:01:56.293 --> 00:01:57.843
Christiana Figueres.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.003
Christiana was the Executive Secretary

00:02:01.027 --> 00:02:04.185
of the UN Framework Convention
on Climate Change,

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:06.758
and as such, had overall responsibility

00:02:06.782 --> 00:02:10.400
for the UN reaching what would become
the Paris Agreement.

00:02:10.424 --> 00:02:12.944
I was running political strategy for her.

00:02:13.714 --> 00:02:15.258
So when she handed me this note,

00:02:15.282 --> 00:02:19.104
I assumed that it would contain
detailed political instructions

00:02:19.128 --> 00:02:22.009
about how we were going to get out of
this nightmare quagmire

00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:23.776
that we seemed to be trapped in.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.669
I took the note and looked at it.

00:02:25.693 --> 00:02:27.534
It said, "Painful.

00:02:27.558 --> 00:02:29.120
But let's approach with love!"

00:02:29.511 --> 00:02:32.040
Now, I love this note for lots of reasons.

00:02:32.064 --> 00:02:35.544
I love the way the little tendrils
are coming out from the word "painful."

00:02:35.568 --> 00:02:39.040
It was a really good visual depiction
of how I felt at that moment.

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:42.047
But I particularly love it
because as I looked at it,

00:02:42.071 --> 00:02:45.465
I realized that it was
a political instruction,

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.613
and that if we were going
to be successful,

00:02:47.637 --> 00:02:49.457
this was how we were going to do it.

00:02:50.112 --> 00:02:51.563
So let me explain that.

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:56.660
What I'd been feeling in those meetings
was actually about control.

00:02:57.295 --> 00:03:01.564
I had moved my life from Brooklyn
in New York to Bonn in Germany

00:03:01.588 --> 00:03:04.507
with the extremely reluctant
support of my wife.

00:03:04.531 --> 00:03:07.934
My children were now in a school
where they couldn't speak the language,

00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.720
and I thought the deal
for all this disruption to my world

00:03:10.744 --> 00:03:14.355
was that I would have some degree
of control over what was going to happen.

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.152
I felt for years that the climate crisis
is the defining challenge

00:03:18.176 --> 00:03:19.411
of our generation,

00:03:19.435 --> 00:03:23.802
and here I was, ready to play my part
and do something for humanity.

00:03:23.826 --> 00:03:26.796
But I put my hands on the levers
of control that I'd been given

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.971
and pulled them,

00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:29.147
and nothing happened.

00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:33.246
I realized the things I could control
were menial day-to-day things.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.228
"Do I ride my bike to work?"
and "Where do I have lunch?",

00:03:36.252 --> 00:03:38.510
whereas the things
that were going to determine

00:03:38.534 --> 00:03:40.403
whether we were going to be successful

00:03:40.427 --> 00:03:43.492
were issues like, "Will Russia
wreck the negotiations?"

00:03:43.516 --> 00:03:46.011
"Will China take responsibility
for their emissions?"

00:03:46.035 --> 00:03:50.574
"Will the US help poorer countries
deal with their burden of climate change?"

00:03:50.598 --> 00:03:52.340
The differential felt so huge,

00:03:52.364 --> 00:03:54.678
I could see no way I could bridge the two.

00:03:54.702 --> 00:03:56.018
It felt futile.

00:03:56.042 --> 00:03:58.278
I began to feel that I'd made a mistake.

00:03:58.302 --> 00:03:59.749
I began to get depressed.

00:04:00.805 --> 00:04:02.439
But even in that moment,

00:04:02.463 --> 00:04:05.908
I realized that what I was feeling
had a lot of similarities

00:04:05.932 --> 00:04:10.047
to what I'd felt when I first found out
about the climate crisis years before.

00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:14.869
I'd spent many of my most
formative years as a Buddhist monk

00:04:14.893 --> 00:04:16.542
in my early 20s,

00:04:16.566 --> 00:04:20.533
but I left the monastic life,
because even then, 20 years ago,

00:04:20.557 --> 00:04:25.512
I felt that the climate crisis was already
a quickly unfolding emergency

00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:27.231
and I wanted to do my part.

00:04:27.774 --> 00:04:29.786
But once I'd left
and I rejoined the world,

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.539
I looked at what I could control.

00:04:31.563 --> 00:04:35.555
It was the few tons of my own emissions
and that of my immediate family,

00:04:35.579 --> 00:04:38.305
which political party
I voted for every few years,

00:04:38.329 --> 00:04:40.168
whether I went on a march or two.

00:04:40.192 --> 00:04:43.265
And then I looked at the issues
that would determine the outcome,

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.348
and they were big
geopolitical negotiations,

00:04:45.372 --> 00:04:47.563
massive infrastructure spending plans,

00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:49.115
what everybody else did.

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.379
The differential again felt so huge

00:04:51.403 --> 00:04:53.810
that I couldn't see any way
that I could bridge it.

00:04:53.834 --> 00:04:55.461
I kept trying to take action,

00:04:55.485 --> 00:04:57.058
but it didn't really stick.

00:04:57.082 --> 00:04:58.399
It felt futile.

00:04:59.206 --> 00:05:02.660
Now, we know that this can be
a common experience for many people,

00:05:02.684 --> 00:05:05.204
and maybe you have had this experience.

00:05:05.228 --> 00:05:07.270
When faced with an enormous challenge

00:05:07.294 --> 00:05:10.580
that we don't feel we have
any agency or control over,

00:05:10.604 --> 00:05:12.784
our mind can do
a little trick to protect us.

00:05:12.808 --> 00:05:15.049
We don't like to feel
like we're out of control

00:05:15.073 --> 00:05:16.736
facing big forces,

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.495
so our mind will tell us,
"Maybe it's not that important.

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:22.398
Maybe it's not happening
in the way that people say, anyway."

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:24.370
Or, it plays down our own role.

00:05:24.394 --> 00:05:27.237
"There's nothing that you
individually can do, so why try?"

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.266
But there's something odd going on here.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.411
Is it really true that humans will only
take sustained and dedicated action

00:05:38.435 --> 00:05:41.424
on an issue of paramount importance

00:05:41.448 --> 00:05:44.176
when they feel they have
a high degree of control?

00:05:45.192 --> 00:05:46.556
Look at these pictures.

00:05:47.303 --> 00:05:50.768
These people are caregivers and nurses

00:05:50.792 --> 00:05:55.266
who have been helping humanity
face the coronavirus COVID-19

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.845
as it has swept around the world
as a pandemic in the last few months.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.570
Are these people able to prevent
the spread of the disease?

00:06:04.145 --> 00:06:05.295
No.

00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:09.398
Are they able to prevent
their patients from dying?

00:06:09.944 --> 00:06:12.666
Some, they will have been able to prevent,

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:15.554
but others, it will have been
beyond their control.

00:06:16.252 --> 00:06:19.897
Does that make their contribution
futile and meaningless?

00:06:20.556 --> 00:06:23.880
Actually, it's offensive
even to suggest that.

00:06:23.904 --> 00:06:26.707
What they are doing is caring
for their fellow human beings

00:06:26.731 --> 00:06:29.458
at their moment of greatest vulnerability.

00:06:29.482 --> 00:06:31.996
And that work has huge meaning,

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.879
to the point where I only
have to show you those pictures

00:06:34.903 --> 00:06:36.059
for it to become evident

00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:39.730
that the courage and humanity
those people are demonstrating

00:06:39.754 --> 00:06:42.862
makes their work
some of the most meaningful things

00:06:42.886 --> 00:06:45.009
that can be done as human beings,

00:06:45.033 --> 00:06:48.034
even though they can't
control the outcome.

00:06:49.155 --> 00:06:50.428
Now, that's interesting,

00:06:50.452 --> 00:06:52.730
because it shows us
that humans are capable

00:06:52.754 --> 00:06:54.941
of taking dedicated and sustained action,

00:06:54.965 --> 00:06:56.948
even when they can't control the outcome.

00:06:57.597 --> 00:06:59.602
But it leaves us with another challenge.

00:07:00.491 --> 00:07:02.259
With the climate crisis,

00:07:02.283 --> 00:07:06.519
the action that we take
is separated from the impact of it,

00:07:06.543 --> 00:07:08.987
whereas what is happening
with these images

00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:14.328
is these nurses are being sustained not
by the lofty goal of changing the world

00:07:14.352 --> 00:07:18.595
but by the day-to-day satisfaction
of caring for another human being

00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:20.413
through their moments of weakness.

00:07:20.796 --> 00:07:23.339
With the climate crisis,
we have this huge separation.

00:07:23.363 --> 00:07:25.964
It used to be that we were
separated by time.

00:07:25.988 --> 00:07:29.798
The impacts of the climate crisis
were supposed to be way off in the future.

00:07:29.822 --> 00:07:32.822
But right now, the future
has come to meet us.

00:07:32.846 --> 00:07:34.354
Continents are on fire.

00:07:34.378 --> 00:07:35.759
Cities are going underwater.

00:07:35.783 --> 00:07:37.261
Countries are going underwater.

00:07:37.285 --> 00:07:41.358
Hundreds of thousands of people are
on the move as a result of climate change.

00:07:41.382 --> 00:07:44.790
But even if those impacts are no longer
separated from us by time,

00:07:44.814 --> 00:07:48.228
they're still separated from us in a way
that makes it difficult to feel

00:07:48.252 --> 00:07:49.404
that direct connection.

00:07:49.428 --> 00:07:51.604
They happen somewhere else
to somebody else

00:07:51.628 --> 00:07:54.835
or to us in a different way
than we're used to experiencing it.

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:58.870
So even though that story of the nurse
demonstrates something to us

00:07:58.894 --> 00:08:00.335
about human nature,

00:08:00.359 --> 00:08:02.549
we're going to have find a different way

00:08:02.573 --> 00:08:05.320
of dealing with the climate crisis
in a sustained manner.

00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:08.898
There is a way that we can do this,

00:08:08.922 --> 00:08:12.970
a powerful combination
of a deep and supporting attitude

00:08:12.994 --> 00:08:15.508
that when combined
with consistent action

00:08:15.532 --> 00:08:19.968
can enable whole societies to take
dedicated action in a sustained way

00:08:19.992 --> 00:08:21.491
towards a shared goal.

00:08:21.515 --> 00:08:24.447
It's been used to great effect
throughout history.

00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:27.609
So let me give you
a historical story to explain it.

00:08:28.669 --> 00:08:32.708
Right now, I am standing in the woods
near my home in southern England.

00:08:33.256 --> 00:08:36.110
And these particular woods
are not far from London.

00:08:36.134 --> 00:08:38.854
Eighty years ago,
that city was under attack.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.273
In the late 1930s,

00:08:41.297 --> 00:08:45.412
the people of Britain would do anything
to avoid facing the reality

00:08:45.436 --> 00:08:48.106
that Hitler would stop at nothing
to conquer Europe.

00:08:48.517 --> 00:08:50.939
Fresh with memories
from the First World War,

00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:53.781
they were terrified of Nazi aggression

00:08:53.805 --> 00:08:56.792
and would do anything to avoid
facing that reality.

00:08:56.816 --> 00:08:59.305
In the end, the reality broke through.

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:03.598
Churchill is remembered for many things,
and not all of them positive,

00:09:03.622 --> 00:09:06.293
but what he did
in those early days of the war

00:09:06.317 --> 00:09:10.002
was he changed the story
the people of Britain told themselves

00:09:10.026 --> 00:09:12.930
about what they were doing
and what was to come.

00:09:12.954 --> 00:09:16.682
Where previously there had been
trepidation and nervousness and fear,

00:09:16.706 --> 00:09:19.052
there came a calm resolve,

00:09:19.076 --> 00:09:20.626
an island alone,

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.373
a greatest hour,

00:09:22.397 --> 00:09:24.952
a greatest generation,

00:09:24.976 --> 00:09:27.972
a country that would fight them
on the beaches and in the hills

00:09:27.996 --> 00:09:29.149
and in the streets,

00:09:29.173 --> 00:09:31.602
a country that would never surrender.

00:09:32.127 --> 00:09:35.033
That change from fear and trepidation

00:09:35.057 --> 00:09:38.479
to facing the reality, whatever
it was and however dark it was,

00:09:38.503 --> 00:09:41.794
had nothing to do with the likelihood
of winning the war.

00:09:41.818 --> 00:09:44.806
There was no news from the front
that battles were going better

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.010
or even at that point that
a powerful new ally had joined the fight

00:09:48.034 --> 00:09:49.802
and changed the odds in their favor.

00:09:49.826 --> 00:09:51.355
It was simply a choice.

00:09:51.379 --> 00:09:55.209
A deep, determined, stubborn
form of optimism emerged,

00:09:55.233 --> 00:09:58.495
not avoiding or denying the darkness
that was pressing in

00:09:58.519 --> 00:10:00.690
but refusing to be cowed by it.

00:10:01.173 --> 00:10:03.863
That stubborn optimism is powerful.

00:10:03.887 --> 00:10:07.223
It is not dependent on assuming
that the outcome is going to be good

00:10:07.247 --> 00:10:09.992
or having a form of wishful thinking
about the future.

00:10:10.016 --> 00:10:13.248
However, what it does is
it animates action

00:10:13.272 --> 00:10:15.298
and infuses it with meaning.

00:10:15.322 --> 00:10:17.071
We know that from that time,

00:10:17.095 --> 00:10:19.277
despite the risk
and despite the challenge,

00:10:19.301 --> 00:10:21.720
it was a meaningful time full of purpose,

00:10:21.744 --> 00:10:23.674
and multiple accounts have confirmed

00:10:23.698 --> 00:10:26.659
that actions that ranged
from pilots in the Battle of Britain

00:10:26.683 --> 00:10:29.275
to the simple act of pulling
potatoes from the soil

00:10:29.299 --> 00:10:31.353
became infused with meaning.

00:10:31.377 --> 00:10:34.895
They were animated towards
a shared purpose and a shared outcome.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.762
We have seen that throughout history.

00:10:37.786 --> 00:10:42.018
This coupling of a deep and determined
stubborn optimism with action,

00:10:42.042 --> 00:10:44.519
when the optimism leads
to a determined action,

00:10:44.543 --> 00:10:46.554
then they can become self-sustaining:

00:10:46.578 --> 00:10:50.066
without the stubborn optimism,
the action doesn't sustain itself;

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.408
without the action, the stubborn optimism
is just an attitude.

00:10:53.432 --> 00:10:58.236
The two together can transform
an entire issue and change the world.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.011
We saw this at multiple other times.

00:11:00.035 --> 00:11:03.107
We saw it when Rosa Parks
refused to get up from the bus.

00:11:03.131 --> 00:11:06.030
We saw it in Gandhi's
long salt marches to the beach.

00:11:06.054 --> 00:11:10.597
We saw it when the suffragettes said that
"Courage calls to courage everywhere."

00:11:10.621 --> 00:11:13.505
And we saw it when Kennedy said
that within 10 years,

00:11:13.529 --> 00:11:15.037
he would put a man on the moon.

00:11:15.061 --> 00:11:18.400
That electrified a generation
and focused them on a shared goal

00:11:18.424 --> 00:11:20.998
against a dark and frightening adversary,

00:11:21.022 --> 00:11:23.626
even though they didn't know
how they would achieve it.

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.377
In each of these cases,

00:11:25.401 --> 00:11:29.762
a realistic and gritty
but determined, stubborn optimism

00:11:29.786 --> 00:11:31.623
was not the result of success.

00:11:31.647 --> 00:11:33.380
It was the cause of it.

00:11:33.404 --> 00:11:36.180
That is also how
the transformation happened

00:11:36.204 --> 00:11:38.154
on the road to the Paris Agreement.

00:11:38.178 --> 00:11:43.078
Those challenging, difficult,
pessimistic meetings transformed

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:46.985
as more and more people decided
that this was our moment to dig in

00:11:47.009 --> 00:11:49.817
and determine that we would not
drop the ball on our watch,

00:11:49.841 --> 00:11:52.707
and we would deliver the outcome
that we knew was possible.

00:11:52.731 --> 00:11:55.825
More and more people transformed
themselves to that perspective

00:11:55.849 --> 00:11:57.102
and began to work,

00:11:57.126 --> 00:12:00.728
and in the end, that worked its way
up into a wave of momentum

00:12:00.752 --> 00:12:02.355
that crashed over us

00:12:02.379 --> 00:12:04.593
and delivered many
of those challenging issues

00:12:04.617 --> 00:12:07.380
with a better outcome
than we could possibly have imagined.

00:12:07.404 --> 00:12:11.633
And even now, years later and with
a climate denier in the White House,

00:12:11.657 --> 00:12:15.388
much that was put in motion
in those days is still unfolding,

00:12:15.412 --> 00:12:18.516
and we have everything to play for
in the coming months and years

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.420
on dealing with the climate crisis.

00:12:21.135 --> 00:12:25.810
So right now, we are coming through
one of the most challenging periods

00:12:25.834 --> 00:12:27.703
in the lives of most of us.

00:12:27.727 --> 00:12:30.389
The global pandemic has been frightening,

00:12:30.413 --> 00:12:33.511
whether personal tragedy
has been involved or not.

00:12:33.916 --> 00:12:37.624
But it has also shaken our belief
that we are powerless

00:12:37.648 --> 00:12:39.418
in the face of great change.

00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:41.862
In the space of a few weeks,

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:46.613
we mobilized to the point where
half of humanity took drastic action

00:12:46.637 --> 00:12:48.335
to protect the most vulnerable.

00:12:48.797 --> 00:12:50.582
If we're capable of that,

00:12:50.606 --> 00:12:54.769
maybe we have not yet tested
the limits of what humanity can do

00:12:54.793 --> 00:12:57.312
when it rises to meet a shared challenge.

00:12:57.738 --> 00:13:02.069
We now need to move beyond
this narrative of powerlessness,

00:13:02.093 --> 00:13:03.860
because make no mistake --

00:13:03.884 --> 00:13:08.465
the climate crisis will be orders
of magnitude worse than the pandemic

00:13:08.489 --> 00:13:11.708
if we do not take the action
that we can still take

00:13:11.732 --> 00:13:14.924
to avert the tragedy that we see
coming towards us.

00:13:15.472 --> 00:13:19.474
We can no longer afford the luxury
of feeling powerless.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.651
The truth is that future generations

00:13:21.675 --> 00:13:24.166
will look back at this
precise moment with awe

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:27.603
as we stand at the crossroads
between a regenerative future

00:13:27.627 --> 00:13:29.908
and one where we have thrown it all away.

00:13:29.932 --> 00:13:34.006
And the truth is that a lot is going
pretty well for us in this transition.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:35.910
Costs for clean energy are coming down.

00:13:35.934 --> 00:13:38.732
Cities are transforming.
Land is being regenerated.

00:13:38.756 --> 00:13:40.919
People are on the streets
calling for change

00:13:40.943 --> 00:13:42.510
with a verve and tenacity

00:13:42.534 --> 00:13:45.007
we have not seen for a generation.

00:13:45.031 --> 00:13:48.253
Genuine success is possible
in this transition,

00:13:48.277 --> 00:13:50.606
and genuine failure is possible, too,

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.723
which makes this the most
exciting time to be alive.

00:13:53.747 --> 00:13:57.629
We can take a decision right now
that we will approach this challenge

00:13:57.653 --> 00:14:02.070
with a stubborn form of gritty,
realistic and determined optimism

00:14:02.094 --> 00:14:05.797
and do everything within our power
to ensure that we shape the path

00:14:05.821 --> 00:14:09.596
as we come out of this pandemic
towards a regenerative future.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:13.476
We can all decide that we will be
hopeful beacons for humanity

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.773
even if there are dark days ahead,

00:14:15.797 --> 00:14:18.127
and we can decide
that we will be responsible,

00:14:18.151 --> 00:14:20.845
we will reduce our own emissions
by at least 50 percent

00:14:20.869 --> 00:14:22.315
in the next 10 years,

00:14:22.339 --> 00:14:26.609
and we will take action to engage
with governments and corporations

00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:29.822
to ensure they do what is necessary
coming out of the pandemic

00:14:29.846 --> 00:14:32.375
to rebuild the world that we want them to.

00:14:32.839 --> 00:14:35.779
Right now, all of these
things are possible.

00:14:36.572 --> 00:14:40.342
So let's go back
to that boring meeting room

00:14:40.366 --> 00:14:42.818
where I'm looking at that note
from Christiana.

00:14:43.683 --> 00:14:45.814
And looking at it took me back

00:14:45.838 --> 00:14:49.384
to some of the most transformative
experiences of my life.

00:14:49.852 --> 00:14:52.720
One of the many things I learned as a monk

00:14:52.744 --> 00:14:59.010
is that a bright mind and a joyful heart
is both the path and the goal in life.

00:14:59.843 --> 00:15:03.896
This stubborn optimism
is a form of applied love.

00:15:04.626 --> 00:15:07.389
It is both the world we want to create

00:15:07.413 --> 00:15:09.601
and the way in which
we can create that world.

00:15:09.625 --> 00:15:12.033
And it is a choice for all of us.

00:15:12.478 --> 00:15:15.562
Choosing to face this moment
with stubborn optimism

00:15:15.586 --> 00:15:18.726
can fill our lives
with meaning and purpose,

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.608
and in doing so, we can put a hand
on the arc of history

00:15:22.632 --> 00:15:25.497
and bend it towards the future
that we choose.

00:15:26.268 --> 00:15:30.001
Yes, living now feels out of control.

00:15:30.025 --> 00:15:33.055
It feels frightening and scary and new.

00:15:33.682 --> 00:15:37.359
But let's not falter
at this most crucial of transitions

00:15:37.383 --> 00:15:39.210
that is coming at us right now.

00:15:39.784 --> 00:15:43.106
Let's face it with stubborn
and determined optimism.

00:15:43.541 --> 00:15:46.628
Yes, seeing the changes
in the world right now

00:15:46.652 --> 00:15:48.005
can be painful.

00:15:48.627 --> 00:15:50.309
But let's approach it with love.

00:15:50.796 --> 00:15:52.000
Thank you.
