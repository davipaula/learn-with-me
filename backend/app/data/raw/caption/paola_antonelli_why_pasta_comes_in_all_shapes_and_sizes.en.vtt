00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.326
Food is design.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.892
It is design when you compose plates,

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:21.433
but it is amazing, even better
and most delightful design

00:00:21.457 --> 00:00:22.754
when it's about the units.

00:00:22.778 --> 00:00:23.955
[Small thing.]

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:25.182
[Big idea.]

00:00:28.714 --> 00:00:30.290
"Pasta" comes from Latin,

00:00:30.314 --> 00:00:32.180
and it means "paste."

00:00:32.204 --> 00:00:36.130
It's about putting together
water and some powder,

00:00:36.154 --> 00:00:38.660
so that you can actually shape it.

00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:41.700
There are cultures in the world
that use rice powder,

00:00:41.724 --> 00:00:44.131
others use soy powder.

00:00:44.155 --> 00:00:46.340
In Italy, we tend to use durum wheat.

00:00:46.364 --> 00:00:48.210
Pasta existed for centuries,

00:00:48.234 --> 00:00:50.720
but it really blossomed
during the Renaissance.

00:00:50.744 --> 00:00:53.790
And it's only later on in the 17th century

00:00:53.814 --> 00:00:56.022
that it became more mass produced.

00:00:56.046 --> 00:00:59.070
Whenever you design an object of any kind,

00:00:59.094 --> 00:01:01.220
you think of how you want it to perform.

00:01:01.244 --> 00:01:03.920
So think about the same for pasta.

00:01:03.944 --> 00:01:05.691
Do you want it to be ribbed

00:01:05.715 --> 00:01:07.320
or you want it to be smooth?

00:01:07.344 --> 00:01:09.970
The ribbed ones absorb the sauce better.

00:01:09.994 --> 00:01:11.690
Do you want them to be round

00:01:11.714 --> 00:01:13.290
or do you want them to be square?

00:01:13.314 --> 00:01:15.375
They have a different feel on the palate.

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.430
Everything is for a reason.

00:01:17.454 --> 00:01:20.790
In the amazing taxonomy
of the pasta species,

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:22.814
there are many different
ways to divide it,

00:01:22.838 --> 00:01:27.720
but one of the basic divisions
is between fresh pasta and dry pasta.

00:01:27.744 --> 00:01:31.920
Dry pasta is always durum
wheat flour and water.

00:01:31.944 --> 00:01:34.320
Fresh pasta could be either that

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:37.010
or it could be flour and eggs.

00:01:37.034 --> 00:01:39.240
Just think of having a dough

00:01:39.264 --> 00:01:41.510
that you can shape in any way you want.

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:43.920
I mean, really, wouldn't you go crazy?

00:01:43.944 --> 00:01:47.390
So fresh and dry, but then,
there's also long and short.

00:01:47.414 --> 00:01:51.310
And then within those families,
there's even more diversity.

00:01:51.334 --> 00:01:55.190
Let's talk about some really
classical types of short pasta.

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:56.820
Penne -- we all know them, right?

00:01:56.844 --> 00:01:59.380
They are cut at a slanted angle,

00:01:59.404 --> 00:02:01.790
perfect to pick up some of the sauce.

00:02:01.814 --> 00:02:04.866
"Farfalle" means "butterflies,"
or how do you call it here,

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.970
bow ties, because they are,
like, pinched in the middle.

00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:10.730
"Orecchiette" means "little ears,"

00:02:10.754 --> 00:02:13.881
and they're typical from Puglia,
and they are delicious.

00:02:13.905 --> 00:02:16.970
And "conquilla," shells,
and of course, they look like shells.

00:02:16.994 --> 00:02:20.350
They are ribbed, so they scoop
up the sauce on the outside

00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:22.530
and they are smooth on the inside.

00:02:22.554 --> 00:02:24.440
Pasta is definitely gorgeous,

00:02:24.464 --> 00:02:27.970
but the form also is about
how it touches the palate,

00:02:27.994 --> 00:02:29.271
how it touches the tongue,

00:02:29.295 --> 00:02:32.225
so it's never just
about giving it a shape.

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:37.640
When you hone one object across centuries,

00:02:37.664 --> 00:02:39.630
standards become really, really high.

00:02:39.654 --> 00:02:43.100
Many so-called great designers
failed miserably,

00:02:43.124 --> 00:02:47.710
because they tried
to impose a shape onto pasta.

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:50.400
The great Philippe Starck tried mandala.

00:02:50.424 --> 00:02:52.600
Some parts of it, the walls,
were very thick,

00:02:52.624 --> 00:02:53.958
and the others were thinner,

00:02:53.982 --> 00:02:55.620
so when you would boil the pasta,

00:02:55.644 --> 00:02:57.359
some of it would be completely mushy

00:02:57.383 --> 00:02:59.780
while part of it
was too crunchy and uncooked.

00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:04.660
So really wrong, but they
were not women from Bologna,

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:07.740
they were not chefs from Naples,

00:03:07.764 --> 00:03:12.170
they were not centuries
of families of grandmothers

00:03:12.194 --> 00:03:18.517
that were trying to improve
on the thinness of the walls of the pasta.

00:03:18.541 --> 00:03:24.429
There's no way to trace pasta
back to one designer, one inventor,

00:03:24.453 --> 00:03:25.790
and that's the beauty of it.

00:03:25.814 --> 00:03:27.460
It belongs to the people.

00:03:27.484 --> 00:03:28.747
And if you think about it,

00:03:28.771 --> 00:03:31.810
this simple mixture
of a carbohydrate and water

00:03:31.834 --> 00:03:34.755
becomes the scaffold
for a whole culture to be built.
