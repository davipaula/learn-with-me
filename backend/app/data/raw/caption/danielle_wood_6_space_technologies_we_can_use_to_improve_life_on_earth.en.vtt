00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.722
I was 17 when I chose my career.

00:00:17.587 --> 00:00:19.976
I was standing outside

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.277
on a hot summer night in Florida

00:00:23.238 --> 00:00:25.565
and just a few miles from the ocean.

00:00:26.728 --> 00:00:30.125
I was waiting for a miracle to happen.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.362
That summer, I was privileged
to work as an intern

00:00:35.386 --> 00:00:37.269
at NASA's Kennedy Space Center,

00:00:37.919 --> 00:00:40.180
and the miracle I was waiting for

00:00:40.204 --> 00:00:43.725
was the launch
of the Columbia Space Shuttle

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:46.902
carrying the Chandra X-Ray Observatory,

00:00:47.486 --> 00:00:53.818
a telescope that would allow scientists
to peer into the edge of black holes.

00:00:54.712 --> 00:00:57.717
The entire sky filled with light.

00:00:58.998 --> 00:01:02.270
And it was as if it was daytime
in the middle of the night.

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.994
Soon, we could feel the rumble
of the engines vibrating in our chests.

00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:09.584
And it wasn't a miracle;

00:01:10.316 --> 00:01:14.333
it was the combined effort
of a team of thousands of people

00:01:14.357 --> 00:01:15.648
who worked together

00:01:15.672 --> 00:01:18.956
to make was seemed impossible a reality.

00:01:19.991 --> 00:01:23.720
And I wanted to join that team.

00:01:24.872 --> 00:01:29.167
So I decided to apply to a university
where I could study aerospace engineering.

00:01:29.644 --> 00:01:30.984
And the following year,

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:33.572
I started at MIT
in my engineering training

00:01:33.596 --> 00:01:36.338
and joined a student project
building space robots.

00:01:37.146 --> 00:01:39.025
And everything was going as I planned,

00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:44.479
except I was confused
about something important.

00:01:45.768 --> 00:01:48.855
Now, my confusion arose
in my summer breaks.

00:01:49.474 --> 00:01:52.242
I traveled to a school in Kenya,

00:01:52.915 --> 00:01:57.559
and there I volunteered
with girls ages five to 17,

00:01:57.583 --> 00:02:02.268
giving them lessons in English
and math and science.

00:02:03.143 --> 00:02:05.901
And they taught me songs in Swahili.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.844
And mostly, I just spent time
getting to know the girls,

00:02:10.868 --> 00:02:12.125
enjoying their presence.

00:02:12.754 --> 00:02:16.848
And I saw that these girls
and the leaders in their community,

00:02:16.872 --> 00:02:19.778
they were overcoming important barriers

00:02:19.802 --> 00:02:23.639
to allow these girls to have
the best possible chances in life.

00:02:24.556 --> 00:02:28.367
And I wanted to join that team.

00:02:28.931 --> 00:02:31.988
I wanted to be part of a team
that would help break down barriers

00:02:32.012 --> 00:02:34.581
and improve the lives
of girls around the world.

00:02:34.605 --> 00:02:37.673
But I was worried that studying
aerospace engineering

00:02:37.697 --> 00:02:39.178
wasn't the most useful.

00:02:39.202 --> 00:02:42.362
I was worried this team in Kenya
couldn't use the technology

00:02:42.386 --> 00:02:43.987
I was learning about space.

00:02:45.305 --> 00:02:48.449
But thankfully, I still learned
that I was wrong.

00:02:49.457 --> 00:02:51.816
I came back and interned at NASA again,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.998
and this time,

00:02:53.022 --> 00:02:54.847
a mentor taught me

00:02:54.871 --> 00:03:01.046
that countries like Kenya had been using
space technology for decades

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.631
to improve the lives
in their own countries.

00:03:03.655 --> 00:03:07.185
And then I knew that I could have
a career in space

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.783
and in development.

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.217
This idea is not new.

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:16.025
In fact, in 1967, the nations
of the world came together

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.792
to write the Outer Space Treaty.

00:03:19.607 --> 00:03:22.269
This treaty made a bold statement,

00:03:22.293 --> 00:03:26.355
saying, "The exploration
and use of outer space

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.955
should be carried on
for the benefit of all peoples,

00:03:30.573 --> 00:03:35.467
irrespective of their level
of economic or scientific development."

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:39.446
We have not truly lived up to this ideal,

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.689
although people have worked
for decades to make this a reality.

00:03:43.826 --> 00:03:47.332
Forces such as colonialism and racism

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.617
and gender inequality

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.785
have actually excluded many people
from the benefits of space

00:03:54.751 --> 00:03:58.292
and caused us to believe
that space is for the few

00:03:58.316 --> 00:04:00.542
or the rich or elite.

00:04:01.731 --> 00:04:04.185
But we cannot afford this attitude,

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.340
because the world is engaged
in a vital mission

00:04:07.364 --> 00:04:09.368
to improve life for everyone.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.049
Our road map for this mission comes
from the 17 Sustainable Development Goals

00:04:16.073 --> 00:04:17.438
of the United Nations.

00:04:17.808 --> 00:04:20.507
All the member states
of the United Nations have agreed

00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:23.837
that these are priorities
between now and 2030.

00:04:24.526 --> 00:04:29.700
These goals give us our key moments
and opportunities of our time --

00:04:30.323 --> 00:04:33.294
opportunities to end extreme poverty,

00:04:33.318 --> 00:04:37.865
to insure that everyone has access
to food and clean water.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.996
We must pursue these goals
as a global community.

00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:48.331
And technology from space
supports sustainable development.

00:04:48.891 --> 00:04:51.910
In fact, there are six space services

00:04:51.934 --> 00:04:55.727
that can help us pursue
the Sustainable Development Goals.

00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:59.962
Over the next few minutes,
let's explore these six services,

00:04:59.986 --> 00:05:03.505
and see examples of just a few
of the goals they help support.

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:04.714
You ready?

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:06.262
OK.

00:05:06.286 --> 00:05:10.479
Communication satellites provide access
to phone and internet service

00:05:10.503 --> 00:05:12.241
to almost any location on Earth.

00:05:12.622 --> 00:05:16.138
This is particularly important
during times of disaster recovery.

00:05:16.523 --> 00:05:20.041
When Typhoon Haiyan
struck the Philippines,

00:05:20.065 --> 00:05:22.839
the local communication networks
needed to be repaired,

00:05:22.863 --> 00:05:26.171
and teams brought in inflatable
communication antennas

00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:28.185
that could link to satellites.

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:30.786
This was useful during the time
of repair and recovery.

00:05:31.453 --> 00:05:34.783
Positioning satellites
tell us where we are

00:05:34.807 --> 00:05:36.663
by telling us where they are.

00:05:37.835 --> 00:05:42.063
Scientists can use this technology
to track endangered wildlife.

00:05:42.727 --> 00:05:45.237
This turtle has been fitted with a system

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:49.826
that allows it to receive location
information from positioning satellites,

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.423
and they send the location
information to scientists

00:05:52.447 --> 00:05:54.021
via communication satellites.

00:05:55.112 --> 00:05:58.263
Scientists can use this knowledge
to then make better policies

00:05:58.287 --> 00:06:00.697
and help determine
how to keep these animals alive.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.561
Earth observation satellites.

00:06:04.928 --> 00:06:07.522
They tell us what's going on
in our environment.

00:06:07.546 --> 00:06:11.044
Right now, there are about 150 satellites

00:06:11.068 --> 00:06:13.850
operated by over 60 government agencies,

00:06:13.874 --> 00:06:16.093
and these are just
those observing the Earth.

00:06:16.117 --> 00:06:18.512
And meanwhile, companies
are adding to this list.

00:06:19.157 --> 00:06:22.994
Most of the governments provide the data
from the satellites for free online.

00:06:23.018 --> 00:06:26.196
Some of these satellites
provide images like this,

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.632
that show what you would see
from a camera.

00:06:28.656 --> 00:06:31.597
This is an image showing
agricultural land in Kansas.

00:06:32.742 --> 00:06:35.627
However, the majority
of the Earth observation satellites

00:06:35.651 --> 00:06:37.874
don't take pictures at all.

00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:39.425
They take measurements.

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:42.550
And they combine these measurements
with complex computer models

00:06:42.574 --> 00:06:45.853
and make beautiful,
global visualizations such as this one,

00:06:45.877 --> 00:06:47.783
showing the ocean currents

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:49.831
and the temperature
of the ocean, globally.

00:06:51.275 --> 00:06:57.167
Or we can look at the salt and smoke
and dust in the atmosphere,

00:06:59.561 --> 00:07:02.236
or the rainfall and snowfall, globally,

00:07:05.085 --> 00:07:10.086
as well as the annual cycle of vegetation
on land and in the ocean.

00:07:12.065 --> 00:07:16.427
Now, scientists can take this information
about the rainfall and the vegetation

00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:17.841
and use it to understand

00:07:17.865 --> 00:07:21.630
what areas on Earth are in danger
of a famine or a drought

00:07:21.654 --> 00:07:24.296
and provide that information
to aid organizations

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.137
so they can be prepared with food aid
before the hunger becomes severe.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.742
In space, we have an orbiting laboratory
on the International Space Station.

00:07:34.653 --> 00:07:37.681
The vehicle and everything inside
are in a form of free fall

00:07:37.705 --> 00:07:38.856
around the Earth,

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.210
and they don't experience
the effect of gravity.

00:07:42.219 --> 00:07:44.481
And because of this,
we call it "microgravity."

00:07:45.412 --> 00:07:47.875
When astronauts are
in the microgravity environment,

00:07:47.899 --> 00:07:51.411
their bodies react
as if they're aging rapidly.

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:54.304
Their bones and muscles weaken,

00:07:54.328 --> 00:07:57.882
and their cardiovascular system
and their immune system change.

00:07:59.052 --> 00:08:02.300
As scientists study how to keep
astronauts healthy in space,

00:08:02.324 --> 00:08:05.632
we can take the exercises and techniques
we use for astronauts

00:08:05.656 --> 00:08:07.608
and transfer them to people on Earth

00:08:07.632 --> 00:08:09.029
to improve our health here.

00:08:09.465 --> 00:08:12.936
Often, as we develop technology
for astronauts and exploration

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.230
or for spacecraft,

00:08:14.254 --> 00:08:17.813
we can also transfer those inventions
to improve life on Earth.

00:08:17.837 --> 00:08:19.171
Here's one of my favorites.

00:08:19.195 --> 00:08:20.951
It's a water filtration system,

00:08:20.975 --> 00:08:23.998
and a key component of it
is based on the technology

00:08:24.022 --> 00:08:26.085
to filter wastewater on the space station.

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:28.220
It's now being used around the world.

00:08:28.795 --> 00:08:32.213
Space is also an infinite source
of inspiration,

00:08:32.237 --> 00:08:33.418
through education,

00:08:33.442 --> 00:08:35.076
through research and astronomy

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.232
and that age-old experience of stargazing.

00:08:38.818 --> 00:08:42.097
Now, countries around the world
are engaging in advancing

00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:43.297
their own development

00:08:43.321 --> 00:08:47.168
by increasing their local knowledge
of engineering and science and space.

00:08:47.644 --> 00:08:51.511
Let's meet some of the world's
newest satellite engineers.

00:08:52.149 --> 00:08:55.300
This is Elyka Abello, from Venezuela.

00:08:56.264 --> 00:08:59.322
Elyka is training as a satellite engineer

00:08:59.346 --> 00:09:02.162
as part of her national
satellite program in Venezuela.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.572
She has designed a software tool

00:09:04.596 --> 00:09:08.347
that allows her team to better design
the power systems for engineering.

00:09:10.036 --> 00:09:12.851
This is Adel Castillo-Duran,

00:09:12.875 --> 00:09:14.025
from the Philippines.

00:09:14.474 --> 00:09:17.481
Adel is both a meteorologist
and a satellite engineer,

00:09:17.505 --> 00:09:20.881
and she uses data from satellites
in her weather forecasting.

00:09:22.549 --> 00:09:24.122
And finally, meet Hala.

00:09:24.708 --> 00:09:26.326
Hala is from the Sudan,

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.590
and as she was studying electrical
engineering as an undergraduate

00:09:29.614 --> 00:09:30.773
in Khartoum,

00:09:30.797 --> 00:09:33.953
she and several students decided
to build their own satellite.

00:09:33.977 --> 00:09:38.351
And later, Hala earned a scholarship
to study satellite engineering

00:09:38.375 --> 00:09:39.691
at the graduate level.

00:09:41.093 --> 00:09:43.367
These stories that I've shared with you

00:09:43.391 --> 00:09:47.504
all illustrate that space truly is useful
for sustainable development

00:09:47.528 --> 00:09:49.302
for the benefit of all peoples.

00:09:50.016 --> 00:09:51.759
But we have more work to do,

00:09:52.487 --> 00:09:56.217
because there are still barriers
that exclude people from space

00:09:56.241 --> 00:09:58.384
and limit the impact of this technology.

00:09:59.402 --> 00:10:02.997
For many people,
Earth observation data is complex.

00:10:03.576 --> 00:10:06.288
And satellite communication
services are too expensive.

00:10:06.966 --> 00:10:10.441
And microgravity research
just appears to be inaccessible.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:16.409
This is what motivates my work
as a professor at MIT's Media Lab.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:21.995
I've recently founded a new research group
called Space Enabled.

00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:27.168
We are working to tear down these barriers
that limit the benefits of space.

00:10:27.699 --> 00:10:30.347
And we're also going to develop
the future applications

00:10:30.371 --> 00:10:33.651
that will continue to contribute
to sustainable development.

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:36.141
We'll keep on this work

00:10:36.165 --> 00:10:40.341
until we can truly say that space
is for the benefit of all peoples,

00:10:40.834 --> 00:10:43.972
and we are all space enabled.

00:10:44.815 --> 00:10:45.974
Thank you.

00:10:45.998 --> 00:10:48.624
(Applause)
