00:00:13.224 --> 00:00:16.498
My day starts just like yours.

00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:22.546
(Laughter)

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.586
When I wake up in the morning,

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.798
I check my phone,

00:00:26.822 --> 00:00:28.484
and then I have a cup of coffee.

00:00:29.512 --> 00:00:32.001
But then my day truly starts.

00:00:33.154 --> 00:00:38.333
It may not be like yours,
because I live my life as an artwork.

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.612
Picture yourself in a giant jewelry box

00:00:44.636 --> 00:00:47.977
with all the beautiful things
that you have ever seen in your life.

00:00:49.336 --> 00:00:53.186
Then imagine that your body is a canvas.

00:00:54.568 --> 00:00:56.311
And on that canvas,

00:00:56.335 --> 00:01:01.397
you have a mission to create a masterpiece

00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:04.212
using the contents
of your giant jewelry box.

00:01:05.757 --> 00:01:08.766
Once you've created your masterpiece,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.298
you might think, "Wow, I created that.

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:13.998
This is who I am today."

00:01:14.736 --> 00:01:16.691
Then you would pick up your house keys,

00:01:16.715 --> 00:01:18.961
walk out the door into the real world,

00:01:18.985 --> 00:01:22.371
maybe take public transport
to the center of the town ...

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:26.913
Possibly walk along the streets
or even go shopping.

00:01:27.731 --> 00:01:29.458
That's my life, every day.

00:01:30.686 --> 00:01:32.079
When I walk out the door,

00:01:32.103 --> 00:01:33.699
these artworks are me.

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:36.377
I am art.

00:01:38.408 --> 00:01:41.572
I have lived as art my entire adult life.

00:01:42.324 --> 00:01:45.015
Living as art is how I became myself.

00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:50.491
I was brought up in a small village
called Fillongley, in England,

00:01:50.515 --> 00:01:52.802
and it was last mentioned
in the "Domesday Book,"

00:01:52.826 --> 00:01:54.461
so that's the mentality.

00:01:54.485 --> 00:01:55.636
(Laughter)

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.982
I was raised by my grandparents,

00:01:58.006 --> 00:01:59.780
and they were antiques dealers,

00:01:59.804 --> 00:02:04.109
so I grew up surrounded
by history and beautiful things.

00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:06.498
I had the most amazing dress-up box.

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:10.340
So as you can imagine, it started then.

00:02:13.817 --> 00:02:16.455
I moved to London when I was 17
to become a model.

00:02:17.718 --> 00:02:19.610
And then I went to study photography.

00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:23.364
I wasn't really happy
with myself at the time,

00:02:23.388 --> 00:02:25.169
so I was always looking for escapism.

00:02:25.884 --> 00:02:28.516
I studied the works of David LaChapelle

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.826
and Steven Arnold,

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.474
photographers who both curated
and created worlds

00:02:33.498 --> 00:02:35.596
that were mind-blowing to me.

00:02:36.038 --> 00:02:41.887
So I decided one day to cross over
from the superficial fashion world

00:02:41.911 --> 00:02:43.570
to the superficial art world.

00:02:43.594 --> 00:02:44.967
(Laughter)

00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:48.426
I decided to live my life
as a work of art.

00:02:50.178 --> 00:02:53.071
I spend hours, sometimes
months, making things.

00:02:53.807 --> 00:02:57.196
My go-to tool is a safety pin,
like this --

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.226
(Laughter)

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.478
They're never big enough.

00:02:59.502 --> 00:03:00.609
(Laughter)

00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:03.157
And I use my fabrics time and time again,

00:03:03.181 --> 00:03:05.054
so I recycle everything that I use.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.590
When I get dressed I'm guided
by color, texture and shape.

00:03:10.848 --> 00:03:12.203
I rarely have a theme.

00:03:12.865 --> 00:03:15.169
I find beautiful objects
from all over the world,

00:03:15.183 --> 00:03:18.021
and I curate them into 3-D tapestries

00:03:18.045 --> 00:03:20.705
over a base layer that covers
my whole body shape ...

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:22.670
because I'm not very happy with my body.

00:03:22.694 --> 00:03:23.844
(Laughs)

00:03:24.177 --> 00:03:26.177
I ask myself, "Should I take something off

00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:28.395
or should I put something on?

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:29.592
100 pieces, maybe?"

00:03:29.616 --> 00:03:31.062
And sometimes, I do that.

00:03:32.963 --> 00:03:35.767
I promise you it's not
too uncomfortable --

00:03:35.791 --> 00:03:37.333
well, just a little --

00:03:37.357 --> 00:03:38.437
(Laughter)

00:03:38.461 --> 00:03:40.700
I might have a safety pin
poking at me sometimes

00:03:40.724 --> 00:03:42.629
when I'm having a conversation with you,

00:03:42.653 --> 00:03:44.195
so I'll kind of go off --

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:45.643
(Laughter)

00:03:47.091 --> 00:03:50.566
It usually takes me
about 20 minutes to get ready,

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.692
which nobody ever believes.

00:03:53.828 --> 00:03:54.978
It's true --

00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:56.152
sometimes.

00:03:56.942 --> 00:03:59.677
So, it's my version
of a t-shirt and jeans.

00:03:59.701 --> 00:04:01.925
(Laughter)

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.104
When I get dressed,
I build like an architect.

00:04:04.892 --> 00:04:07.546
I carefully place things
till I feel they belong.

00:04:08.157 --> 00:04:10.791
Then, I get a lot of my ideas
from lucid dreaming.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.766
I actually go to sleep
to come up with my ideas,

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.319
and I've taught myself to wake up
to write them down.

00:04:18.002 --> 00:04:19.995
I wear things till they fall apart,

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.200
and then, I give them a new life.

00:04:22.686 --> 00:04:24.423
The gold outfit, for example --

00:04:24.447 --> 00:04:28.486
it was the outfit that I wore
to the Houses of Parliament in London.

00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:32.244
It's made of armor,
sequins and broken jewelry,

00:04:32.268 --> 00:04:35.015
and I was the first person
to wear armor to Parliament

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.719
since Oliver Cromwell
banned it in the 17th century.

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.555
Things don't need
to be expensive to be beautiful.

00:04:42.335 --> 00:04:47.120
Try making outfits out of bin liners
or trash you found out on the streets.

00:04:47.144 --> 00:04:48.295
You never know,

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:50.660
they might end up on the pages of "Vogue."

00:04:51.932 --> 00:04:54.156
There's over 6,000 pieces
in my collection,

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.486
ranging from 2,000-year-old Roman rings
to ancient Buddhist artifacts.

00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:02.084
I believe in sharing what I do
and what I have with others,

00:05:02.108 --> 00:05:05.046
so I decided to create an art exhibition,

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.998
which is currently traveling
to museums around the world.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.305
It contains an army of me --

00:05:11.329 --> 00:05:13.478
life-size sculptures
as you can see behind me,

00:05:13.502 --> 00:05:14.653
they're here --

00:05:14.677 --> 00:05:15.894
they are my life, really.

00:05:15.918 --> 00:05:19.152
They're kind of like 3-D tapestries
of my existence as living as art.

00:05:19.176 --> 00:05:21.652
They contain plastic crystals
mixed with diamonds,

00:05:21.676 --> 00:05:24.267
beer cans and royal silks all in one look.

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.508
I like the fact that the viewer
can never make the assumption

00:05:27.532 --> 00:05:29.191
about what's real and what's fake.

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:34.390
I find it important to explore and share
cultures through my works.

00:05:35.746 --> 00:05:38.156
I use clothing as a means to investigate

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.636
and appreciate people
from all over the world.

00:05:41.557 --> 00:05:46.711
Sometimes, people think
I'm a performer or a drag queen.

00:05:47.704 --> 00:05:49.125
I'm not.

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:52.725
Although my life appears
to be a performance,

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:54.125
it's not.

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:55.844
It's very real.

00:05:56.791 --> 00:05:59.832
People respond to me as they would
any other type of artwork.

00:06:00.272 --> 00:06:03.164
Many people are fascinated and engaged.

00:06:03.536 --> 00:06:06.574
Some people walk around me,
staring, shy at first.

00:06:07.024 --> 00:06:11.446
Then they come up to me and they say
they love or absolutely hate what I do.

00:06:12.242 --> 00:06:15.986
I sometimes respond, and other times
I let the art talk for itself.

00:06:18.187 --> 00:06:21.964
The most annoying thing in the world
is when people want to touch the artwork.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.860
But I understand.

00:06:24.822 --> 00:06:26.531
But like a lot of contemporary art,

00:06:26.555 --> 00:06:28.035
many people are dismissive.

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:29.966
Some people are critical,

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.342
others are abusive.

00:06:31.918 --> 00:06:34.809
I think it comes from
the fear of the different --

00:06:34.833 --> 00:06:36.170
the unknown.

00:06:36.194 --> 00:06:38.671
There are so many reactions to what I do,

00:06:38.695 --> 00:06:41.729
and I've just learned
not to take them personally.

00:06:42.803 --> 00:06:45.336
I've never lived
as Daniel Lismore, the person.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.454
I've lived as Daniel Lismore, the artwork.

00:06:48.174 --> 00:06:50.761
And I've faced every
obstacle as an artwork.

00:06:52.402 --> 00:06:54.294
It can be hard ...

00:06:54.318 --> 00:06:58.459
especially if your wardrobe
takes up a 40-foot container,

00:06:58.483 --> 00:07:01.397
three storage units
and 30 boxes from IKEA --

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:02.936
(Laughter)

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.968
and sometimes, it can be
very difficult, getting into cars,

00:07:06.992 --> 00:07:08.218
and sometimes --

00:07:08.242 --> 00:07:10.910
well, this morning I didn't fit
through my bathroom door,

00:07:10.934 --> 00:07:12.177
so that was a problem.

00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:13.848
(Laughter)

00:07:13.872 --> 00:07:15.847
What does it mean to be yourself?

00:07:16.313 --> 00:07:18.182
People say it all the time,

00:07:18.206 --> 00:07:19.896
but what does it truly mean,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.346
and why does it matter?

00:07:22.257 --> 00:07:26.465
How does life change when you choose
to be unapologetically yourself?

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.466
I've had to face struggles
and triumphs whilst living my life as art.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.730
I've been put on private jets

00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:36.329
and flown around the world.

00:07:36.724 --> 00:07:38.957
My work's been displayed
in prestigious museums,

00:07:38.971 --> 00:07:40.448
and I've had the opportunity --

00:07:40.472 --> 00:07:43.204
that is my grandparents, by the way,

00:07:43.228 --> 00:07:44.943
they're the people that raised me,

00:07:44.967 --> 00:07:46.323
and there I am --

00:07:46.347 --> 00:07:47.348
(Laughs)

00:07:47.372 --> 00:07:52.834
(Applause)

00:07:52.858 --> 00:07:55.611
So I've been put on private jets,
flown around the world,

00:07:55.635 --> 00:07:57.700
and yet, it's not been that easy

00:07:57.724 --> 00:08:00.796
because at times, I've been homeless,

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.182
I've been spat at,

00:08:02.206 --> 00:08:04.096
I've been abused, sometimes daily,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.008
bullied my entire life,

00:08:06.032 --> 00:08:08.494
rejected by countless individuals,

00:08:08.518 --> 00:08:10.404
and I've been stabbed.

00:08:10.428 --> 00:08:12.334
But what hurt the most

00:08:12.358 --> 00:08:14.517
was being put on the "Worst Dressed" list.

00:08:14.541 --> 00:08:17.751
(Laughter)

00:08:17.775 --> 00:08:20.106
It can be hard, being yourself,

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:21.903
but I've found it's the best way.

00:08:21.927 --> 00:08:23.284
There's the "Worst Dressed."

00:08:23.308 --> 00:08:24.854
(Laughs)

00:08:25.768 --> 00:08:28.371
As the quote goes,
"Everyone else is already taken."

00:08:29.128 --> 00:08:32.415
I've come to realize that confidence
is a concept you can choose.

00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:37.121
I've come to realize that authenticity
is necessary, and it's powerful.

00:08:38.206 --> 00:08:41.244
I've tried to spend time
being like other people.

00:08:41.741 --> 00:08:42.981
It didn't work.

00:08:43.362 --> 00:08:45.705
It's a lot of hard work,
not being yourself.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.340
I have a few questions for you all.

00:08:50.612 --> 00:08:51.762
Who are you?

00:08:53.074 --> 00:08:54.878
How many versions of you are there?

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:58.272
And I have one final question:

00:08:59.031 --> 00:09:02.040
Are you using them all to your advantage?

00:09:03.503 --> 00:09:07.163
In reality, everyone is capable
of creating their own masterpiece.

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:09.628
You should try it sometime.

00:09:09.652 --> 00:09:10.802
It's quite fun.

00:09:11.453 --> 00:09:12.604
Thank you.

00:09:12.628 --> 00:09:17.841
(Applause and cheers)
