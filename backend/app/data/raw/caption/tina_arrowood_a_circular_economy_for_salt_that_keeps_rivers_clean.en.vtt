00:00:12.873 --> 00:00:14.817
Growing up in northern Wisconsin,

00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:18.650
I've naturally developed a connection
to the Mississippi River.

00:00:19.167 --> 00:00:20.341
When I was little,

00:00:20.365 --> 00:00:24.512
my sister and I would have contests
to see who could spell

00:00:24.536 --> 00:00:28.250
"M-i-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i" the fastest.

00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:30.679
When I was in elementary school,

00:00:30.703 --> 00:00:35.244
I got to learn about the early explorers
and their expeditions,

00:00:35.268 --> 00:00:39.078
Marquette and Joliet, and how they used
the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River

00:00:39.102 --> 00:00:42.171
and its tributaries
to discover the Midwest,

00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:45.395
and to map a trade route
to the Gulf of Mexico.

00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:47.910
In graduate school,

00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:50.395
I was fortunate to have
the Mississippi River

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:52.823
outside my research laboratory window

00:00:52.847 --> 00:00:54.914
at the University of Minnesota.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.080
During that five-year period,
I got to know the Mississippi River.

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:01.742
I got to know its temperamental nature

00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:04.861
and where it would flood
its banks at one moment,

00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:07.186
and then shortly thereafter,

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.410
you would see its dry shorelines.

00:01:10.218 --> 00:01:12.980
Today, as a physical organic chemist,

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:15.035
I'm committed to use my training

00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:18.245
to help protect rivers,
like the Mississippi,

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:21.399
from excessive salt
that can come from human activity.

00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:23.549
Because, you know,

00:01:23.573 --> 00:01:27.920
salt is something that can contaminate
freshwater rivers.

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:34.264
And freshwater rivers,
they have only salt levels of .05 percent.

00:01:34.677 --> 00:01:37.700
And at this level, it's safe to drink.

00:01:38.296 --> 00:01:42.276
But the majority of the water
on our planet is housed in our oceans,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.322
and ocean water has a salinity level
of more than three percent.

00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:49.506
And if you drank that,
you'd be sick very quick.

00:01:50.427 --> 00:01:55.061
So, if we are to compare
the relative volume of ocean water

00:01:55.085 --> 00:01:58.363
to that of the river water
that's on our planet,

00:01:58.387 --> 00:02:01.331
and let's say we are able
to put the ocean water

00:02:01.355 --> 00:02:04.133
into an Olympic-size swimming pool,

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:08.523
then our planet's river water
would fit in a one-gallon jug.

00:02:09.095 --> 00:02:12.007
So you can see it's a precious resource.

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:14.864
But do we treat it
like a precious resource?

00:02:14.888 --> 00:02:17.157
Or rather, do we treat it
like that old rug

00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:20.394
that you put in your front doorway
and wipe your feet off on it?

00:02:21.244 --> 00:02:25.403
Treating rivers like that old rug
has severe consequences.

00:02:25.427 --> 00:02:26.627
Let's take a look.

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:31.022
Let's see what just one teaspoon
of salt can do.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.794
If we add one teaspoon of salt

00:02:33.818 --> 00:02:37.260
to this Olympic-size
swimming pool of ocean water,

00:02:37.284 --> 00:02:39.550
the ocean water stays ocean water.

00:02:40.085 --> 00:02:42.315
But if we add that same
one teaspoon of salt

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:45.331
to this one-gallon jug
of fresh river water,

00:02:45.355 --> 00:02:48.402
suddenly, it becomes too salty to drink.

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:50.371
So the point here is,

00:02:50.395 --> 00:02:56.061
because rivers, the volume is so small
compared to the oceans,

00:02:56.085 --> 00:02:58.704
it is especially vulnerable
to human activity,

00:02:58.728 --> 00:03:01.461
and we need to take care to protect them.

00:03:02.117 --> 00:03:04.482
So recently, I surveyed the literature

00:03:04.506 --> 00:03:07.585
to look at the river health
around the world.

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.839
And I fully expected to see
ailing river health

00:03:10.863 --> 00:03:15.736
in regions of water scarcity
and heavy industrial development.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.627
And I saw that
in northern China and in India.

00:03:19.736 --> 00:03:24.146
But I was surprised
when I read a 2018 article

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.734
where there's 232 river-sampling sites

00:03:28.758 --> 00:03:31.321
sampled across the United States.

00:03:31.345 --> 00:03:33.000
And of those sites,

00:03:33.024 --> 00:03:36.515
37 percent had increasing salinity levels.

00:03:37.204 --> 00:03:38.926
What was more surprising

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.783
is that the ones
with the highest increases

00:03:41.807 --> 00:03:44.712
were found on the east part
of the United States,

00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:46.767
and not the arid southwest.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.101
The authors of this paper postulate

00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:54.854
that this could be due
to using salt to deice roads.

00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:58.349
Potentially, another source of this salt

00:03:58.373 --> 00:04:01.506
could come from salty
industrial wastewaters.

00:04:02.084 --> 00:04:07.382
So as you see, human activities
can convert our freshwater rivers

00:04:07.406 --> 00:04:09.906
into water that's more like our oceans.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.413
So we need to act and do something
before it's too late.

00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:16.056
And I have a proposal.

00:04:16.942 --> 00:04:21.251
We can take a three-step
river-defense mechanism,

00:04:21.275 --> 00:04:26.335
and if industrial-water users
practice this defense mechanism,

00:04:26.359 --> 00:04:30.533
we can put our rivers
in a much safer position.

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:33.310
This involves, number one,

00:04:33.334 --> 00:04:35.823
extracting less water from our rivers

00:04:35.847 --> 00:04:39.810
by implementing water recycle
and reuse operations.

00:04:40.403 --> 00:04:41.561
Number two,

00:04:41.585 --> 00:04:45.593
we need to take the salt
out of these salty industrial wastewaters

00:04:45.617 --> 00:04:49.132
and recover it and reuse it
for other purposes.

00:04:49.695 --> 00:04:53.760
And number three,
we need to convert salt consumers,

00:04:53.784 --> 00:04:56.839
who currently source our salt from mines

00:04:56.863 --> 00:05:01.447
into salt consumers that source our salt
from recycled salt sources.

00:05:01.942 --> 00:05:05.418
This three-part defense mechanism
is already in play.

00:05:05.442 --> 00:05:08.381
This is what northern China
and India are implementing

00:05:08.405 --> 00:05:10.568
to help to rehabilitate the rivers.

00:05:11.123 --> 00:05:12.647
But the proposal here

00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:16.877
is to use this defense mechanism
to protect our rivers,

00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:19.435
so we don't need to rehabilitate them.

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:23.595
And the good news is,
we have technology that can do this.

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:25.000
It's with membranes.

00:05:25.532 --> 00:05:28.762
Membranes that can separate
salt and water.

00:05:29.593 --> 00:05:32.728
Membranes have been around
for a number of years,

00:05:32.752 --> 00:05:37.714
and they're based on polymeric materials
that separate based on size,

00:05:37.738 --> 00:05:40.029
or they can separate based on charge.

00:05:40.371 --> 00:05:43.895
The membranes that are used
to separate salt and water

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:46.942
typically separate based on charge.

00:05:46.966 --> 00:05:49.569
And these membranes
are negatively charged,

00:05:49.593 --> 00:05:52.434
and help to repel the negatively
charged chloride ions

00:05:52.458 --> 00:05:54.525
that are in that dissolved salt.

00:05:55.974 --> 00:06:00.426
So, as I said, these membranes
have been around for a number of years,

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:07.433
and currently, they are purifying
25 million gallons of water every minute.

00:06:07.457 --> 00:06:09.372
Even more than that, actually.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.170
But they can do more.

00:06:12.254 --> 00:06:16.952
These membranes are based
under the principle of reverse osmosis.

00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:22.426
Now osmosis is this natural process
that happens in our bodies --

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.268
you know, how our cells work.

00:06:24.292 --> 00:06:27.714
And osmosis is where you have two chambers

00:06:27.738 --> 00:06:31.316
that separate two levels
of salt concentration.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.410
One with low salt concentration

00:06:33.434 --> 00:06:35.504
and one with high salt concentration.

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:39.562
And separating the two chambers
is the semipermeable membrane.

00:06:39.871 --> 00:06:42.307
And under the natural osmosis process,

00:06:42.331 --> 00:06:46.341
what happens is the water naturally
transports across that membrane

00:06:46.365 --> 00:06:48.286
from the area of low salt concentration

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.778
to the area of high salt concentration,

00:06:50.802 --> 00:06:53.309
until an equilibrium is met.

00:06:54.437 --> 00:06:58.112
Now reverse osmosis,
it's the reverse of this natural process.

00:06:58.136 --> 00:07:00.260
And in order to achieve this reversal,

00:07:00.284 --> 00:07:05.138
what we do is we apply a pressure
to the high-concentration side

00:07:05.162 --> 00:07:08.741
and in doing so, we drive the water
the opposite direction.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.559
And so the high-concentration side
becomes more salty,

00:07:12.583 --> 00:07:13.963
more concentrated,

00:07:13.987 --> 00:07:17.983
and the low-concentration side
becomes your purified water.

00:07:18.436 --> 00:07:23.253
So using reverse osmosis,
we can take an industrial wastewater

00:07:23.277 --> 00:07:27.879
and convert up to 95 percent of it
into pure water,

00:07:27.903 --> 00:07:32.116
leaving only five percent
as this concentrated salty mixture.

00:07:33.022 --> 00:07:36.339
Now, this five percent
concentrated salty mixture

00:07:36.363 --> 00:07:37.513
is not waste.

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:40.581
So scientists have also
developed membranes

00:07:40.605 --> 00:07:44.948
that are modified to allow
some salts to pass through

00:07:44.972 --> 00:07:46.122
and not others.

00:07:46.939 --> 00:07:48.273
Using these membranes,

00:07:48.297 --> 00:07:51.395
which are commonly referred to
as nanofiltration membranes,

00:07:51.419 --> 00:07:54.752
now this five percent
concentrated salty solution

00:07:54.776 --> 00:07:58.267
can be converted
into a purified salt solution.

00:07:58.863 --> 00:08:03.934
So, in total, using reverse osmosis
and nanofiltration membranes,

00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.434
we can convert industrial wastewater

00:08:06.458 --> 00:08:10.228
into a resource of both water and salt.

00:08:10.633 --> 00:08:12.247
And in doing so,

00:08:12.271 --> 00:08:16.668
achieve pillars one and two
of this river-defense mechanism.

00:08:17.557 --> 00:08:22.160
Now, I've introduced this
to a number of industrial-water users,

00:08:22.184 --> 00:08:24.871
and the common response is,

00:08:24.895 --> 00:08:27.561
"Yeah, but who is going to use my salt?"

00:08:28.014 --> 00:08:31.014
So that's why pillar number three
is so important.

00:08:31.038 --> 00:08:34.818
We need to transform folks
that are using mine salt

00:08:34.842 --> 00:08:37.548
into consumers of recycled salt.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.707
So who are these salt consumers?

00:08:41.056 --> 00:08:43.326
Well, in 2018 in the United States,

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:48.249
I learned that 43 percent of the salt
consumed in the US

00:08:48.273 --> 00:08:51.519
was used for road salt deicing purposes.

00:08:52.289 --> 00:08:55.553
Thirty-nine percent
was used by the chemical industry.

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:58.410
So let's take a look
at these two applications.

00:08:58.927 --> 00:09:01.934
So, I was shocked.

00:09:01.958 --> 00:09:05.117
In the 2018-2019 winter season,

00:09:05.141 --> 00:09:08.094
one million tons of salt

00:09:08.118 --> 00:09:12.161
was applied to the roads
in the state of Pennsylvania.

00:09:13.315 --> 00:09:15.114
One million tons of salt is enough

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:18.338
to fill two-thirds
of an Empire State Building.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.802
That's one million tons of salt
mined from the earth,

00:09:22.826 --> 00:09:24.524
applied to our roads,

00:09:24.548 --> 00:09:28.490
and then it washes off
into the environment and into our rivers.

00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:33.022
So the proposal here
is that we could at least

00:09:33.046 --> 00:09:36.666
source that salt from a salty
industrial wastewater,

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.102
and prevent that
from going into our rivers,

00:09:39.126 --> 00:09:42.180
and rather use that to apply to our roads.

00:09:42.204 --> 00:09:44.954
So at least when the melt happens
in the springtime

00:09:44.978 --> 00:09:47.728
and you have this high-salinity runoff,

00:09:47.752 --> 00:09:50.006
the rivers are at least
in a better position

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.577
to defend themselves against that.

00:09:54.053 --> 00:09:55.434
Now, as a chemist,

00:09:55.458 --> 00:09:59.568
the opportunity though
that I'm more psyched about

00:09:59.592 --> 00:10:04.274
is the concept of introducing
circular salt into the chemical industry.

00:10:05.052 --> 00:10:09.449
And the chlor-alkali industry is perfect.

00:10:10.028 --> 00:10:13.498
Chlor-alkali industry
is the source of epoxies,

00:10:13.522 --> 00:10:16.376
it's the source of urethanes and solvents

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:20.040
and a lot of useful products
that we use in our everyday lives.

00:10:20.593 --> 00:10:24.928
And it uses sodium chloride salt
as its key feed stack.

00:10:25.934 --> 00:10:28.236
So the idea here is,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.649
well, first of all,
let's look at linear economy.

00:10:30.673 --> 00:10:34.006
So in a linear economy,
they're sourcing that salt from a mine,

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.085
it goes through this chlor-alkali process,

00:10:36.109 --> 00:10:38.069
made into a basic chemical,

00:10:38.093 --> 00:10:40.831
which then can get converted
into another new product,

00:10:40.855 --> 00:10:42.788
or a more functional product.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.982
But during that conversion process,

00:10:46.006 --> 00:10:49.815
oftentimes salt is regenerated
as the by-product,

00:10:49.839 --> 00:10:52.237
and it ends up
in the industrial wastewater.

00:10:53.402 --> 00:10:58.497
So, the idea is that we can
introduce circularity,

00:10:58.521 --> 00:11:03.371
and we can recycle the water and salt
from those industrial wastewater streams,

00:11:03.395 --> 00:11:04.815
from the factories,

00:11:04.839 --> 00:11:08.910
and we can send it to the front end
of the chlor-alkali process.

00:11:10.388 --> 00:11:11.594
Circular salt.

00:11:11.936 --> 00:11:14.078
So how impactful is this?

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.849
Well, let's just take one example.

00:11:16.873 --> 00:11:20.359
Fifty percent of the world's
production of propylene oxide

00:11:20.383 --> 00:11:22.835
is made through the chlor-alkali process.

00:11:23.379 --> 00:11:28.616
And that's a total of about five million
tons of propylene oxide

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.849
on an annual basis, made globally.

00:11:31.768 --> 00:11:35.926
So that's five million tons of salt
mined from the earth

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.839
converted through the chlor-alkali process
into propylene oxide,

00:11:39.863 --> 00:11:41.553
and then during that process,

00:11:41.577 --> 00:11:45.801
five million tons of salt
that ends up in wastewater streams.

00:11:46.547 --> 00:11:48.031
So five million tons

00:11:48.055 --> 00:11:51.452
is enough salt to fill
three Empire State Buildings.

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:53.794
And that's on an annual basis.

00:11:54.157 --> 00:11:59.696
So you can see how circular salt
can provide a barrier

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.637
to our rivers from this excessive
salty discharge.

00:12:04.446 --> 00:12:06.035
So you might wonder,

00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:10.049
"Well, gosh, these membranes
have been around for a number of years,

00:12:10.073 --> 00:12:14.178
so why aren't people implementing
wastewater reuse?

00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:16.772
Well, the bottom line is,

00:12:16.796 --> 00:12:19.709
it costs money to implement
wastewater reuse.

00:12:20.114 --> 00:12:21.700
And second,

00:12:21.724 --> 00:12:24.886
water in these regions is undervalued.

00:12:25.323 --> 00:12:26.657
Until it's too late.

00:12:27.244 --> 00:12:31.783
You know, if we don't plan
for freshwater sustainability,

00:12:31.807 --> 00:12:34.164
there are some severe consequences.

00:12:34.188 --> 00:12:37.340
You can just ask one of the world's
largest chemical manufacturers

00:12:37.364 --> 00:12:41.027
who last year took
a 280-million dollar hit

00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:45.040
due to low river levels
of the Rhine River in Germany.

00:12:45.995 --> 00:12:49.855
You can ask the residents
of Cape Town, South Africa,

00:12:49.879 --> 00:12:54.077
who experienced a year-over-year drought
drying up their water reserves,

00:12:54.101 --> 00:12:57.368
and then being asked
not to flush their toilets.

00:12:58.292 --> 00:13:00.077
So you can see,

00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:02.315
we have solutions here, with membranes,

00:13:02.339 --> 00:13:06.766
where we can provide pure water,

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.004
we can provide pure salt,

00:13:09.028 --> 00:13:11.172
using these membranes, both of these,

00:13:11.196 --> 00:13:14.433
to help to protect our rivers
for future generations.

00:13:14.734 --> 00:13:15.893
Thank you.

00:13:15.917 --> 00:13:18.611
(Applause)
