00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.620
The earliest time measurements were

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.330
observations of cycles of the natural world,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.260
using patterns of changes from day to night

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.800
and season to season to build calendars.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.840
More precise time-keeping, like sundials

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.600
and mechanical clocks, eventually came along

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.720
to put time in more convenient boxes.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.485
But what exactly is it that we’re measuring?

00:00:43.485 --> 00:00:45.765
Is time something that physically exists,

00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:47.995
or is it just in our heads?

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:50.296
At first the answer seems obvious—

00:00:50.296 --> 00:00:51.966
of course time exists;

00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:54.246
it constantly unfolds all around us,

00:00:54.246 --> 00:00:57.536
and it’s hard to imagine the universe without it.

00:00:57.536 --> 00:00:59.956
But our understanding of time started

00:00:59.956 --> 00:01:03.226
getting complicated thanks to Einstein.

00:01:03.226 --> 00:01:05.646
His theory of relativity tells us that time

00:01:05.646 --> 00:01:08.526
passes for everyone, but doesn’t always pass

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:11.916
at the same rate for people in different situations,

00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:14.566
like those travelling close to the speed of light

00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:18.006
or orbiting a supermassive black hole.

00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:21.196
Einstein resolved the malleability of time

00:01:21.196 --> 00:01:24.816
by combining it with space to define space-time,

00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:29.856
which can bend, but behaves
in consistent, predictable ways.

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:32.386
Einstein’s theory seemed to confirm that time

00:01:32.386 --> 00:01:35.606
is woven into the very fabric of the universe.

00:01:35.606 --> 00:01:39.036
But there’s a big question it didn’t fully resolve:

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:42.536
why is it we can move through space in any direction,

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:44.866
but through time in only one?

00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:48.046
No matter what we do, the past is always,

00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:50.586
stubbornly, behind us.

00:01:50.586 --> 00:01:53.706
This is called the arrow of time.

00:01:53.706 --> 00:01:55.926
When a drop of food coloring is

00:01:55.926 --> 00:01:57.606
dropped into a glass of water,

00:01:57.606 --> 00:02:00.306
we instinctively know that the coloring

00:02:00.306 --> 00:02:02.206
will drift out from the drop,

00:02:02.206 --> 00:02:04.366
eventually filling the glass.

00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:06.906
Imagine watching the opposite happen.

00:02:06.906 --> 00:02:11.346
Here, we’d recognize time as unfolding backwards.

00:02:11.346 --> 00:02:13.996
We live in a universe where the food coloring

00:02:13.996 --> 00:02:15.556
spreads out in the water, 

00:02:15.556 --> 00:02:18.106
not a universe where it collects together.

00:02:18.106 --> 00:02:20.856
In physics, this is described by

00:02:20.856 --> 00:02:23.126
the Second Law of Thermodynamics,

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:26.116
which says that systems will gain disorder,

00:02:26.116 --> 00:02:28.786
or entropy, over time.

00:02:28.786 --> 00:02:32.506
Systems in our universe move from order to disorder,

00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:34.456
and it is that property of the universe

00:02:34.456 --> 00:02:38.416
that defines the direction of time’s arrow.

00:02:38.416 --> 00:02:41.446
So if time is such a fundamental property,

00:02:41.446 --> 00:02:44.116
it should be in our most fundamental equations

00:02:44.116 --> 00:02:46.686
describing the universe, right?

00:02:46.686 --> 00:02:48.026
We currently have two sets of

00:02:48.026 --> 00:02:49.916
equations that govern physics.

00:02:49.916 --> 00:02:52.121
General relativity describes the

00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:54.311
behavior of very large things,

00:02:54.311 --> 00:02:58.251
while quantum physics explains the very small.

00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:00.871
One of the biggest goals in theoretical physics

00:03:00.871 --> 00:03:03.941
over the last half century has been reconciling

00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:08.771
the two into one fundamental “theory of everything."

00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:10.401
There have been many attempts

00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:12.101
—none yet proven—

00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:14.351
and they treat time in different ways.

00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:18.091
Oddly enough, one contender called the Wheeler-DeWitt

00:03:18.091 --> 00:03:21.661
equation, doesn’t include time at all.

00:03:21.661 --> 00:03:23.991
Like all current theories of everything,

00:03:23.991 --> 00:03:26.131
that equation is speculative.

00:03:26.131 --> 00:03:27.841
But as a thought experiment,

00:03:27.841 --> 00:03:31.171
if it or a similarly time-starved equation

00:03:31.171 --> 00:03:33.541
turned out to be true, would that mean

00:03:33.541 --> 00:03:37.091
that time doesn’t exist, at the most fundamental level?

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:40.681
Could time just be some sort of illusion generated

00:03:40.681 --> 00:03:42.351
by the limitations of the way

00:03:42.351 --> 00:03:44.091
we perceive the universe?

00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:46.191
We don’t yet know, but maybe that’s

00:03:46.191 --> 00:03:47.981
the wrong way of thinking about it.

00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:52.191
Instead of asking if time exists as a fundamental property,

00:03:52.191 --> 00:03:55.711
maybe it could exist as an emergent one.

00:03:55.711 --> 00:03:59.711
Emergent properties are things that don’t exist

00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:01.871
in individual pieces of a system,

00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:04.751
but do exist for the system as a whole.

00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:08.471
Each individual water molecule doesn’t have a tide,

00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:10.941
but the whole ocean does.

00:04:10.941 --> 00:04:13.821
A movie creates change through time by using

00:04:13.821 --> 00:04:17.461
a series of still images that appear to have a fluid,

00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:19.761
continuous change between them.

00:04:19.761 --> 00:04:21.741
Flipping through the images fast enough,

00:04:21.741 --> 00:04:24.461
our brains perceive the passage of time

00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:26.801
from the sequence of still images.

00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:29.701
No individual frame of the movie changes

00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:32.181
or contains the passage of time,

00:04:32.181 --> 00:04:34.481
but it’s a property that comes out of how

00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:37.591
the pieces are strung together.

00:04:37.591 --> 00:04:41.041
The movement is real, yet also an illusion.

00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:45.641
Could the physics of time somehow be a similar illusion?

00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:49.461
Physicists are still exploring these and other questions,

00:04:49.461 --> 00:04:52.101
so we’re far from a complete explanation.

00:04:52.101 --> 00:04:54.411
At least for the moment.
