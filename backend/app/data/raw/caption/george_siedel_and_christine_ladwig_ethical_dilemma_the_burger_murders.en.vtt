00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.383
A few years ago, you founded a company
that manufactures meatless burgers.

00:00:12.383 --> 00:00:16.313
Your product is now sold 
in stores worldwide.

00:00:16.313 --> 00:00:19.283
But you’ve recently received awful news:

00:00:19.283 --> 00:00:24.685
three unrelated people in one city died
after eating your burgers.

00:00:24.685 --> 00:00:28.825
The police concluded that a criminal 
targeted your brand,

00:00:28.825 --> 00:00:34.192
injecting poison into your product 
in at least two grocery stores.

00:00:34.192 --> 00:00:39.615
The culprit used an ultrafine instrument 
that left no trace on the packaging,

00:00:39.615 --> 00:00:43.659
making it impossible to determine 
which products were compromised.

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.799
Your burgers were immediately
removed from the two stores

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:48.489
where the victims bought them.

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.589
The deaths are headline news,

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.281
the killer is still at large, 
and sales have plummeted.

00:00:55.281 --> 00:00:59.281
You must quickly develop a strategy 
to deal with the crisis.

00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:02.111
Your team comes up with three options:

00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:03.931
1. Do nothing.

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:09.456
2. Pull the products from grocery stores 
citywide and destroy them.

00:01:09.456 --> 00:01:14.413
Or 3. Pull and destroy 
the product worldwide.

00:01:14.413 --> 00:01:16.623
Which do you choose?

00:01:16.623 --> 00:01:21.156
Your company lawyer explains 
that a recall is not required by law

00:01:21.156 --> 00:01:23.876
because the criminal is fully responsible.

00:01:23.876 --> 00:01:27.166
She recommends the first option— 
doing nothing—

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:32.290
because recalling the product 
could look like an admission of fault.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.490
But is that the most ethical strategy?

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.410
To gauge the ethicality of each choice,

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.880
you could perform 
a “stakeholder analysis.”

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.880
This would allow you to weigh 
the interests of some key stakeholders—

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.497
investors, employees, and customers—
against one another.

00:01:51.497 --> 00:01:52.757
With the first option

00:01:52.757 --> 00:01:56.757
your advisors project that the crisis 
will eventually blow over.

00:01:56.757 --> 00:02:00.757
Sales will then improve but probably 
stay below prior levels

00:02:00.757 --> 00:02:02.957
because of damage to the brand.

00:02:02.957 --> 00:02:06.087
As a result, you’ll have to lay off 
some employees,

00:02:06.087 --> 00:02:09.227
and investors will suffer minor losses.

00:02:09.227 --> 00:02:14.981
But more customers could die 
if the killer poisoned packages elsewhere.

00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:18.321
The second option is expensive
in the short-term

00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:20.951
and will require greater employee layoffs

00:02:20.951 --> 00:02:24.031
and additional financial loss 
to investors.

00:02:24.031 --> 00:02:28.031
But this option is safer 
for customers in the city

00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:33.122
and could create enough trust 
that sales will eventually rebound.

00:02:33.122 --> 00:02:36.792
The third option is the most expensive 
in the short-term

00:02:36.792 --> 00:02:41.951
and will require significant 
employee layoffs and investor losses.

00:02:41.951 --> 00:02:46.026
Though you have no evidence that these
crimes are an international threat,

00:02:46.026 --> 00:02:50.277
this option provides the greatest
customer protection.

00:02:50.277 --> 00:02:53.367
Given the conflict between the interests
of your customers

00:02:53.367 --> 00:02:56.217
versus those of your investors 
and employees,

00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:58.937
which strategy is the most ethical?

00:02:58.937 --> 00:03:03.030
To make this decision, 
you could consider these tests:

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.930
First is the Utilitarian Test:

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.550
Utilitarianism is a philosophy concerned

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.967
with maximizing the greatest amount 
of good for the greatest number of people.

00:03:12.967 --> 00:03:17.326
What would be the impact of each
option on these terms?

00:03:17.326 --> 00:03:19.636
Second is the Family Test:

00:03:19.636 --> 00:03:23.576
How would you feel
explaining your decision to your family?

00:03:23.576 --> 00:03:25.783
Third is the Newspaper Test:

00:03:25.783 --> 00:03:30.903
how would you feel reading about it 
on the front page of the local newspaper?

00:03:30.903 --> 00:03:33.813
And finally, you could use 
the Mentor Test:

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:38.680
If someone you admire were making 
this decision, what would they do?

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.906
Johnson &amp; Johnson CEO James Burke 
faced a similar challenge in 1982

00:03:44.906 --> 00:03:50.772
after a criminal added the poison cyanide
to bottles of Tylenol in Chicago.

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:53.682
Seven people died and sales dropped.

00:03:53.682 --> 00:03:56.692
Industry analysts said 
the company was done for.

00:03:56.692 --> 00:04:02.314
In response, Burke decided to pull Tylenol
from all shelves worldwide,

00:04:02.314 --> 00:04:06.643
citing customer safety 
as the company’s highest priority.

00:04:06.643 --> 00:04:12.924
Johnson &amp; Johnson recalled and destroyed
an estimated 32 million bottles of Tylenol

00:04:12.924 --> 00:04:17.325
valued at 250 million in today’s dollars.

00:04:17.325 --> 00:04:22.422
1.5 million of the recalled bottles 
were tested and 3 of them—

00:04:22.422 --> 00:04:24.622
all from the Chicago area—

00:04:24.622 --> 00:04:27.182
were found to contain cyanide.

00:04:27.182 --> 00:04:31.297
Burke’s decision helped the company 
regain the trust of its customers,

00:04:31.297 --> 00:04:34.737
and product sales rebounded within a year.

00:04:34.737 --> 00:04:39.265
Prompted by the Tylenol murders, 
Johnson &amp; Johnson became a leader

00:04:39.265 --> 00:04:41.935
in developing tamper-resistant packaging

00:04:41.935 --> 00:04:45.495
and the government instituted 
stricter regulations.

00:04:45.495 --> 00:04:48.495
The killer, meanwhile, was never caught.

00:04:48.495 --> 00:04:52.495
Burke’s decision prevented further deaths
from the initial poisoning,

00:04:52.495 --> 00:04:57.566
but the federal government investigated
hundreds of copycat tampering incidents

00:04:57.566 --> 00:05:00.886
involving other products 
in the following weeks.

00:05:00.886 --> 00:05:04.886
Could these have been prevented 
with a different response?

00:05:04.886 --> 00:05:08.886
Was Burke acting in the interest 
of the public or of his company?

00:05:08.886 --> 00:05:12.016
Was this good ethics or good marketing?

00:05:12.016 --> 00:05:17.578
As with all ethical dilemmas, 
this has no clear right or wrong answer.

00:05:17.578 --> 00:05:22.448
And for your meatless burger empire,
the choice remains yours.
