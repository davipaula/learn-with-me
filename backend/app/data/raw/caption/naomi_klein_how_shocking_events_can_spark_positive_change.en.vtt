00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.216
There's a question I've been
puzzling over and writing about

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.320
for pretty much all of my adult life.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.416
Why do some large-scale crises

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.175
jolt us awake and inspire us
to change and evolve

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.096
while others might jolt us a bit,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.120
but then it's back to sleep?

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.016
Now, the kind of shocks
I'm talking about are big --

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.616
a cataclysmic market crash,
rising fascism,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.080
an industrial accident
that poisons on a massive scale.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.096
Now, events like this
can act like a collective alarm bell.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.360
Suddenly, we see a threat,
we get organized.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.480
We discover strength and resolve
that was previously unimaginable.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.880
It's as if we're no longer
walking, but leaping.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.240
Except, our collective alarm
seems to be busted.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.456
Faced with a crisis,
we often fall apart, regress

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.456
and that becomes a window
for antidemocratic forces

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.480
to push societies backwards,
to become more unequal and more unstable.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.056
Ten years ago, I wrote
about this backwards process

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.850
and I called it the "Shock Doctrine."

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.256
So what determines which road
we navigate through crisis?

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.656
Whether we grow up fast
and find those strengths

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.520
or whether we get knocked back.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.216
And I'd say this is
a pressing question these days.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.360
Because things are
pretty shocking out there.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.616
Record-breaking storms, drowning cities,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.576
record-breaking fires
threatening to devour them,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.680
thousands of migrants
disappearing beneath the waves.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.536
And openly supremacist movements rising,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.520
in many of our countries
there are torches in the streets.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.880
And now there's no shortage
of people who are sounding the alarm.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.096
But as a society,
I don't think we can honestly say

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.056
that we're responding
with anything like the urgency

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.160
that these overlapping crises
demand from us.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.456
And yet, we know from history

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.256
that it is possible for crisis
to catalyze a kind of evolutionary leap.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.456
And one of the most striking examples
of this progressive power of crisis

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.040
is the Great Crash of 1929.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.296
There was the shock
of the sudden market collapse

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.416
followed by all of the aftershocks,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.536
the millions who lost everything
thrown onto breadlines.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.296
And this was taken by many as a message
that the system itself was broken.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.896
And many people listened
and they leapt into action.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.016
In the United States and elsewhere,
governments began to weave a safety net

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.256
so that the next time there was a crash

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.600
there would be programs
like social security to catch people.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.696
There were huge job-creating
public investments

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.080
in housing, electrification and transit.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.296
And there was a wave
of aggressive regulation

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.616
to reign in the banks.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.376
Now, these reforms were far from perfect.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.136
In the US, African American workers,
immigrants and women

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.800
were largely excluded.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.336
But the Depression period,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.416
along with the transformation
of allied nations and economies

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.576
during the World War II effort,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.856
show us that it is possible
for complex societies

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.560
to rapidly transform themselves
in the face of a collective threat.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.136
Now, when we tell this story
of the 1929 Crash,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.416
that's usually the formula
that it follows --

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.536
that there was a shock
and it induced a wake-up call

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.016
and that produced a leap to a safer place.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.136
Now, if that's really what it took,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.976
then why isn't it working anymore?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.456
Why do today's non-stop shocks --

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.456
why don't they spur us into action?

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.176
Why don't they produce leaps?

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.760
Especially when it comes
to climate change.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.495
So I want to talk to you today

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:36.296
about what I think is a much more
complete recipe for deep transformation

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.456
catalyzed by shocking events.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.016
And I'm going to focus
on two key ingredients

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.960
that usually get left out
of the history books.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.096
One has to do with imagination,
the other with organization.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.096
Because it's in the interplay
between the two

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.896
where revolutionary power lies.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.520
So let's start with imagination.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.416
The victories of the New Deal
didn't happen just because suddenly

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.160
everybody understood
the brutalities of laissez-faire.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.056
This was a time, let's remember,
of tremendous ideological ferment,

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.136
when many different ideas
about how to organize societies

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.456
did battle with one another
in the public square.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.336
A time when humanity dared to dream big

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.616
about different kinds of futures,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.136
many of them organized
along radically egalitarian lines.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.896
Now, not all of these ideas were good

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.880
but this was an era
of explosive imagining.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.296
This meant that the movements
demanding change

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.296
knew what they were against --
crushing poverty, widening inequality --

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.736
but just as important,
they knew what they were for.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.720
They had their "no"
and they had their "yes," too.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.056
They also had very different
models of political organization

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.616
than we do today.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.096
For decades, social and labor movements

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.736
had been building up
their membership bases,

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.520
linking their causes together
and increasing their strength.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.736
Which meant that by the time
the Crash happened,

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.496
there was already a movement
that was large and broad enough

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.336
to, for instance, stage strikes
that didn't just shut down factories,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.440
but shut down entire cities.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.696
The big policy wins of the New Deal
were actually offered as compromises.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.120
Because the alternative
seemed to be revolution.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.840
So, let's adjust
that equation from earlier.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.216
A shocking event plus utopian imagination

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.856
plus movement muscle,

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.280
that's how we get a real leap.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.976
So how does our present moment measure up?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.696
We are living, once again, at a time
of extraordinary political engagements.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.840
Politics is a mass obsession.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.976
Progressive movements are growing
and resisting with tremendous courage.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.040
And yet, we know from history
that "no" is not enough.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.896
Now, there are some "yeses"
out there that are emerging.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.296
And they're actually getting
a lot bolder quickly.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.096
Where climate activists
used to talk about changing light bulbs,

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.816
now we're pushing
for 100 percent of our energy

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.016
to come from the sun, wind and waves,

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.720
and to do it fast.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.176
Movements catalyzed
by police violence against black bodies

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:31.016
are calling for an end
to militarized police, mass incarceration

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.600
and even for reparations for slavery.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.816
Students are not just
opposing tuition increases,

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.056
but from Chile to Canada to the UK,

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.720
they are calling for free tuition
and debt cancellation.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.056
And yet, this still doesn't add up

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.176
to the kind of holistic
and universalist vision

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.576
of a different world
than our predecessors had.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.800
So why is that?

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.896
Well, very often
we think about political change

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.736
in defined compartments these days.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.376
Environment in one box,
inequality in another,

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.496
racial and gender justice
in a couple of other boxes,

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.520
education over here, health over there.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.856
And within each compartment,

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.456
there are thousands upon thousands
of different groups and NGOs,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.456
each competing with one another
for credit, name recognition

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.976
and of course, resources.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.800
In other words, we act
a lot like corporate brands.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.976
Now, this is often referred to
as the problem of silos.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.176
Now, silos are understandable.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.256
They carve up our complex world
into manageable chunks.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.135
They help us feel less overwhelmed.

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:49.655
But in the process,
they also train our brains to tune out

00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:52.736
when somebody else's issue comes up

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.056
and when somebody else's issue
needs our help and support.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:03.056
And they also keep us from seeing
glaring connections between our issues.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.376
So for instance, the people fighting
poverty and inequality

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.296
rarely talk about climate change.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.696
Even though we see time and again

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.216
that it's the poorest of people

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.280
who are the most vulnerable
to extreme weather.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.016
The climate change people
rarely talk about war and occupation.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.776
Even though we know
that the thirst for fossil fuels

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.520
has been a major driver of conflict.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.576
The environmental movement
has gotten better at pointing out

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.056
that the nations that are getting
hit hardest by climate change

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.640
are populated overwhelmingly
by black and brown people.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.016
But when black lives
are treated as disposable

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.016
in prisons, in schools and on the streets,

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.840
these connections are too rarely made.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.496
The walls between our silos

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.376
also means that our solutions,
when they emerge,

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.696
are also disconnected from each other.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.696
So progressives now have this long list
of demands that I was mentioning earlier,

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.336
those "yeses."

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.736
But what we're still missing

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.136
is that coherent picture
of the world we're fighting for.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.960
What it looks like, what it feels like,
and most of all, what its core values are.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.456
And that really matters.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.296
Because when large-scale crises hit us

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:21.736
and we are confronted with the need
to leap somewhere safer,

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.736
there isn't any agreement
on what that place is.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.496
And leaping without a destination

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.176
looks a lot like jumping up and down.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.416
(Laughter)

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:36.016
Fortunately, there are all kinds
of conversations and experiments going on

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.296
to try to overcome these divisions
that are holding us back.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.120
And I want to finish
by talking about one of them.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.176
A couple of years ago,
a group of us in Canada

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.416
decided that we were hitting the limits

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.480
of what we could accomplish
in our various silos.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.656
So we locked ourselves
in a room for two days,

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:57.136
and we tried to figure out
what bound us together.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.016
In that room were people
who rarely get face to face.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.616
There were indigenous elders
with hipsters working on transit.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.456
There was the head of Greenpeace

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.536
with a union leader
representing oil workers and loggers.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.560
There were faith leaders
and feminist icons and many more.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.896
And we gave ourselves
a pretty ambitious assignment:

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:24.040
agreeing on a short statement
describing the world after we win.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:29.496
The world after we've already
made the transition to a clean economy

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.776
and a much fairer society.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.016
In other words,

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.736
instead of trying to scare people
about what will happen if we don't act,

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:43.736
we decided to try to inspire them
with what could happen if we did act.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.176
Sensible people are always telling us

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.136
that change needs to come
in small increments.

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.496
That politics is the art of the possible

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.376
and that we can't let the perfect
be the enemy of the good.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.896
Well, we rejected all of that.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.856
We wrote a manifesto,
and we called it "The Leap."

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.296
I have to tell you
that agreeing on our common "yes"

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.696
across such diversity of experiences

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.816
and against a backdrop
of a lot of painful history

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.416
was not easy work.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.296
But it was also pretty thrilling.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.976
Because as soon as we gave ourselves
permission to dream,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.336
those threads connecting
much of our work became self-evident.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.776
We realized, for instance,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.376
that the bottomless quest for profits

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.656
that is forcing so many people
to work more than 50 hours a week,

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.176
without security,

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.776
and that is fueling
this epidemic of despair

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:42.456
is the same quest for bottomless
profits and endless growth

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.816
that is at the heart
of our ecological crisis

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.416
and is destabilizing our planet.

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.120
It also became clear what we need to do.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.136
We need to create
a culture of care-taking.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.456
In which no one
and nowhere is thrown away.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:05.440
In which the inherent value of all people
and every ecosystem is foundational.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.136
So we came up with this people's platform,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.616
and don't worry, I'm not going to read
the whole thing to you out loud --

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.656
if you're interested,
you can read it at theleap.org.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.056
But I will give you a taste
of what we came up with.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:23.696
So we call for that 100 percent
renewable economy in a hurry,

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.376
but we went further.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.696
Calls for new kinds of trade deals,

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.776
a robust debate
on a guaranteed annual income,

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.816
full rights for immigrant workers,

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.096
getting corporate money out of politics,

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.720
free universal day care,
electoral reform and more.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.976
What we discovered
is that a great many of us

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:49.016
are looking for permission to act
less like brands and more like movements.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.416
Because movements don't care about credit.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.440
They want good ideas
to spread far and wide.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.696
What I love about The Leap

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.496
is that it rejects the idea
that there is this hierarchy of crisis,

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.936
and it doesn't ask anyone
to prioritize one struggle over another

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.200
or wait their turn.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.136
And though it was birthed in Canada,

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.656
we've discovered that it travels well.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.776
Since we launched, The Leap
has been picked up around the world

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.456
with similar platforms,

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.616
being written from Nunavut to Australia,

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.816
to Norway to the UK and the US,

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.856
where it's gaining a lot of traction
in cities like Los Angeles,

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.896
where it's being localized.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.336
And also in rural communities
that are traditionally very conservative,

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.280
but where politics is failing
the vast majority of people.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:43.840
Here's what I've learned from studying
shocks and disasters for two decades.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.400
Crises test us.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.560
We either fall apart or we grow up fast.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.000
Finding new reserves of strength
and capacity that we never knew we had.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.096
The shocking events
that fill us with dread today

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:05.360
can transform us, and they can
transform the world for the better.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.480
But first we need to picture the world
that we're fighting for.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.400
And we have to dream it up together.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:18.560
Right now, every alarm in our house
is going off simultaneously.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.216
It's time to listen.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.016
It's time to leap.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.256
Thank you.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:28.880
(Applause)
