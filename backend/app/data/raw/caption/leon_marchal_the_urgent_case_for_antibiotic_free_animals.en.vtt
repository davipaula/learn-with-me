00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:15.833
There was a time
when simple infections were deadly,

00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:19.293
but now, thanks to the wide
availability of antibiotics,

00:00:19.317 --> 00:00:21.651
this is merely a relic of the past.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.260
But actually, I should say "was,"

00:00:24.284 --> 00:00:28.442
because nowadays,
we're using antibiotics so much

00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:30.880
that the bacteria
that cause these infections

00:00:30.904 --> 00:00:32.497
are becoming resistant.

00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:35.610
And that should really scare
the hell out of all of us.

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:40.339
If we do not change our behavior
and wean ourselves off antibiotics,

00:00:40.363 --> 00:00:43.704
the UN predicts that by 2050,

00:00:43.728 --> 00:00:48.323
antimicrobial resistance
will become our single biggest killer.

00:00:48.887 --> 00:00:50.759
So we must start to act.

00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:53.998
But "where to begin"
is an interesting question,

00:00:54.022 --> 00:00:57.251
because we humans are not
the only ones using antibiotics.

00:00:57.275 --> 00:01:02.133
Worldwide, 50 to 80 percent
of all antibiotics are used by animals.

00:01:02.863 --> 00:01:05.426
Not all of these are critical
for human health,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.942
but if we do not get it
under control right now,

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:11.542
we're looking at a very scary future
for humans and animals alike.

00:01:12.809 --> 00:01:16.181
To begin, let's talk
about how we ended up here.

00:01:16.205 --> 00:01:21.543
The first large-scale use of antibiotics
was in the early '50s of the last century.

00:01:21.863 --> 00:01:24.601
In the Western world,
prosperity was increasing

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:27.315
and people wanted to eat
more animal protein.

00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:30.895
When animals were sick,
you could now treat them with antibiotics

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:32.966
so they did not die and kept growing.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.387
But soon, it was discovered

00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:37.704
that adding small and regular amounts
of antibiotics to the feed

00:01:37.728 --> 00:01:39.212
kept the animals healthy,

00:01:39.236 --> 00:01:41.061
made them grow faster

00:01:41.085 --> 00:01:43.037
and caused them to need less feed.

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:45.323
So these antibiotics worked well --

00:01:45.347 --> 00:01:47.021
really well, actually.

00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:49.363
And with increasing animal production,

00:01:49.387 --> 00:01:52.398
also antibiotic use skyrocketed worldwide.

00:01:53.034 --> 00:01:56.018
Unfortunately,
so did antibiotic resistance.

00:01:57.066 --> 00:02:01.399
The reason your doctor tells you
to finish the entire bottle of antibiotics

00:02:01.423 --> 00:02:05.058
is if you shorten your dose,
you will not kill all of the bugs.

00:02:05.082 --> 00:02:09.123
And the ones that stick around
build up the antibiotic resistance.

00:02:09.923 --> 00:02:14.133
It's the same problem with giving animals
small and regular doses of antibiotics:

00:02:14.157 --> 00:02:16.839
some bad bugs die but not all of them.

00:02:16.863 --> 00:02:19.276
Spread that across an entire industry,

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.768
and you can understand
that we accidentally build up

00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:25.339
a large reservoir
of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:28.560
But I hate to break it to you --

00:02:28.584 --> 00:02:30.651
the problem doesn't stop there.

00:02:30.998 --> 00:02:33.656
You know who else takes antibiotics?

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.921
Fluffy, your cat, and Rover, your dog.

00:02:35.945 --> 00:02:37.064
(Laughter)

00:02:37.088 --> 00:02:40.415
Pets rank even amongst
the heaviest users of all,

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:41.832
and they use antibiotics

00:02:41.856 --> 00:02:44.148
that are much more critical
for human health.

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.831
Combine this with how close
we live with our companion animals

00:02:48.855 --> 00:02:50.577
and you understand the risk

00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:55.299
of you picking up antibiotic-resistant
bacteria from your own pet.

00:02:57.141 --> 00:03:00.153
But how do these
antibiotic-resistant bacteria

00:03:00.177 --> 00:03:02.109
in farm animals affect you?

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:04.856
Let me give you an example
we have, actually, data on.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.100
The levels of antibiotic-resistant
salmonella in pigs in Europe

00:03:10.124 --> 00:03:12.545
against different types of antibiotics

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.307
range from less than a percent
to as high [as] 60 percent.

00:03:16.728 --> 00:03:18.625
Which means that in most cases,

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:22.378
this antibiotic will not work anymore
to kill this salmonella.

00:03:23.228 --> 00:03:25.164
And there was a high correlation

00:03:25.188 --> 00:03:28.109
between antibiotic-resistant
salmonella in the pig

00:03:28.133 --> 00:03:29.871
and in the final product.

00:03:29.895 --> 00:03:31.807
Whether that is pork chop,

00:03:31.831 --> 00:03:33.474
spare ribs or minced meat.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.388
Now, luckily, typically
less than one percent

00:03:37.412 --> 00:03:39.911
of all raw meat, fish or eggs

00:03:39.935 --> 00:03:41.352
will contain salmonella.

00:03:41.847 --> 00:03:44.958
And this only poses a risk
when not treated well.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.195
Still, there are over 100,000
human salmonella cases in the EU

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:52.885
and more than a million cases in the US.

00:03:53.822 --> 00:03:57.107
In the US, leading
to 23,000 hospitalizations

00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:59.844
and 450 people dead each year.

00:04:01.201 --> 00:04:03.511
With antibiotic-resistant
salmonella on the rise,

00:04:03.535 --> 00:04:06.053
this death toll is likely to increase.

00:04:07.416 --> 00:04:10.029
But it's not only
about consuming yourself.

00:04:10.053 --> 00:04:12.831
This year, more
than 100 people got infected

00:04:12.855 --> 00:04:15.656
with a multidrug-resistant salmonella

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.814
after feeding pig ears,
as a treat, to their dog.

00:04:19.915 --> 00:04:23.923
So we really must cut back
on antibiotic use in animal production.

00:04:23.947 --> 00:04:26.050
And luckily, this is starting to happen.

00:04:26.534 --> 00:04:29.101
The EU was the first region to ban

00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:31.998
putting antibiotics
in low doses in the feed.

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:34.664
From '99 on, in several steps,

00:04:34.688 --> 00:04:37.763
the amount of different types
of antibiotics allowed was reduced,

00:04:37.787 --> 00:04:40.660
and in 2006, a complete ban
went into place.

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:42.771
Antibiotics were only allowed

00:04:42.795 --> 00:04:45.513
when a veterinarian determined
the animal was sick.

00:04:46.168 --> 00:04:47.327
Sounds great, right?

00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:48.521
Problem solved.

00:04:48.545 --> 00:04:50.012
No, wait, not so fast.

00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:53.220
As soon as the reduction program started,

00:04:53.244 --> 00:04:55.252
it was very quickly discovered

00:04:55.276 --> 00:04:57.633
that antibiotics had been
the perfect blanket

00:04:57.657 --> 00:04:59.905
to cover up a lot of bad farm practices.

00:05:00.276 --> 00:05:02.204
More and more animals became sick

00:05:02.228 --> 00:05:04.895
and needed to be
cured with ... antibiotics.

00:05:05.347 --> 00:05:07.791
So instead of the total amount going down,

00:05:07.815 --> 00:05:09.282
it actually increased.

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:12.156
Surely, that was not the way to go.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.878
But luckily, that was not
the end of the story.

00:05:14.902 --> 00:05:18.195
The whole European agricultural sector
started on a journey,

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:20.887
and I think it's a journey
anybody can learn from.

00:05:21.878 --> 00:05:24.402
This is also the time
I personally entered the scene.

00:05:24.426 --> 00:05:27.160
I joined a large European feed compounder.

00:05:27.184 --> 00:05:31.807
A feed compounder makes a total diet
for a farmer to feed to his animals

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:33.771
and often also provides the advice

00:05:33.795 --> 00:05:36.323
on how to raise the animals
in the best way.

00:05:36.657 --> 00:05:39.451
I was really motivated
to work together with my colleagues,

00:05:39.475 --> 00:05:41.855
veterinarians and, of course, the farmers

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:45.712
to figure out how to keep the animals
healthy and antibiotic-free.

00:05:46.212 --> 00:05:48.712
Now there are three major things
that need to happen

00:05:48.736 --> 00:05:50.387
for antibiotic-free production.

00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:52.362
Let me walk you through the playbook.

00:05:52.386 --> 00:05:54.847
To start -- and it sounds very obvious --

00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:56.911
that our hygiene is the place to start.

00:05:57.212 --> 00:05:59.942
Better cleaning of the stable
and the drinking-water lines

00:05:59.966 --> 00:06:03.585
making it harder for the disease
to come in and spread across the stable.

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:05.934
That's all very important,

00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:08.395
but the part I was personally
most interested in

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:10.133
was better feeding for the animals,

00:06:10.157 --> 00:06:11.307
better nutrition.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.228
Feeding a well-balanced diet is important.

00:06:14.252 --> 00:06:15.411
Think about it this way:

00:06:15.435 --> 00:06:18.583
when you yourself do not eat
enough fiber, you do not feel well.

00:06:19.061 --> 00:06:22.101
Part of the food you consume
is not digested by yourself

00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:25.045
but fermented in your large
intestine by bacteria.

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:28.517
So you're feeding those microbes
with part of your diet.

00:06:29.768 --> 00:06:33.371
Initially, most young animals
were fed low-fiber,

00:06:33.395 --> 00:06:35.204
high-starch and protein,

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:38.209
very finely ground
and highly digestible diets.

00:06:39.041 --> 00:06:41.850
Like being yourself on a diet
of hamburger buns,

00:06:41.874 --> 00:06:44.199
rice, waffles and protein bars.

00:06:45.342 --> 00:06:48.712
We changed this to a lower-protein,

00:06:48.736 --> 00:06:51.307
higher-fiber, coarser type of diet.

00:06:51.807 --> 00:06:55.723
Like being on a diet of whole grains,
salad with meat or beans.

00:06:56.363 --> 00:06:59.103
This shifted the bacterial flora
in the animals' guts

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:00.863
to the more beneficial ones

00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:03.944
and reduced the chance
that pathogens would flourish.

00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:05.687
You might be surprised

00:07:05.711 --> 00:07:08.815
but not only diet composition,
also diet structure plays a role.

00:07:09.203 --> 00:07:12.195
Simply the fact
that the same diet is coarser

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:14.536
will lead to a better-developed
digestive tract,

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.427
and thus, a healthier animal.

00:07:17.564 --> 00:07:21.570
But the best part was that farmers
started to buy this actually, too.

00:07:22.136 --> 00:07:24.086
Unlike some other parts of the world,

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.228
Western European farmers mainly still make
their independent buying decisions:

00:07:28.252 --> 00:07:30.704
who to buy the feed from
and sell their animals to.

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:33.196
So what you're actually selling in the end

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.701
reflects the actual local need
of these farmers.

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:37.498
For example,

00:07:37.522 --> 00:07:39.204
the protein content in piglet diets

00:07:39.228 --> 00:07:42.323
in countries that are much more vigilant
in reducing antibiotics,

00:07:42.347 --> 00:07:44.566
like, for example,
Germany and the Netherlands,

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.934
were already 10 to 15 percent lower

00:07:46.958 --> 00:07:50.162
than in a country like the UK,
which was slower to pick this up.

00:07:51.742 --> 00:07:55.099
But, like with better hygiene,
better nutrition helps

00:07:55.123 --> 00:07:58.020
but will not totally prevent you
from becoming sick.

00:07:58.044 --> 00:07:59.424
So more is needed.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.236
And that's why we turned
to the microbiome.

00:08:02.831 --> 00:08:05.006
Making the water with the feed more acidic

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.815
helps to create an environment

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:09.204
that benefits the more beneficial bacteria

00:08:09.228 --> 00:08:11.028
and inhibits the pathogens.

00:08:11.514 --> 00:08:12.665
Like fermented food,

00:08:12.689 --> 00:08:15.566
whether it's yogurt, sauerkraut or salami,

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.578
they'll all spoil less quickly, too.

00:08:19.018 --> 00:08:20.812
Now, with modern techniques,

00:08:20.836 --> 00:08:23.415
like the ones based on DNA testing,

00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:27.141
we can see that there are many more
different microorganisms present.

00:08:27.165 --> 00:08:30.156
And this ecosystem,
which we call the microbiome,

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.267
is much more complex.

00:08:33.109 --> 00:08:37.379
Turns out there are about eight times
more microorganisms in your gut

00:08:37.403 --> 00:08:39.336
as tissue cells in your body.

00:08:39.815 --> 00:08:42.101
And for animals, the impact is no less.

00:08:43.495 --> 00:08:46.582
So if we want to work
without antibiotics in animal production,

00:08:46.606 --> 00:08:49.590
we have to make the animals
much more robust.

00:08:49.614 --> 00:08:51.487
So that when a disease strikes,

00:08:51.511 --> 00:08:53.353
the animals are much more resilient.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.951
And this three-pronged
nutribiosis approach

00:08:56.975 --> 00:09:00.475
involving the host, nutrition
and the microbiome

00:09:00.499 --> 00:09:02.094
is the way to do it.

00:09:02.118 --> 00:09:06.077
Now the practice of raising animals
on an antibiotic-containing

00:09:06.101 --> 00:09:09.823
or antibiotic-use-provoking diet
is a bit cheaper at farm level.

00:09:11.132 --> 00:09:14.910
But in the end, we are talking about
a few percent at the consumer level.

00:09:14.934 --> 00:09:16.466
That's actually quite affordable

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.633
for the middle- and high-income
part of the world population.

00:09:19.657 --> 00:09:21.696
And a very small price to pay

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.146
when our own health
or our loved ones' health is at stake.

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:28.403
So what do you think,
what direction do we take?

00:09:28.823 --> 00:09:33.260
Do we allow antimicrobial resistance
to become our biggest killer,

00:09:33.284 --> 00:09:36.484
at huge financial
and a special personal cost?

00:09:36.974 --> 00:09:41.494
Or do we, besides reducing
human antibiotic consumption,

00:09:41.518 --> 00:09:45.037
truly start embracing
antibiotic-free animal production?

00:09:45.371 --> 00:09:47.704
For me, the choice is very obvious.

00:09:48.085 --> 00:09:49.601
But to make this happen,

00:09:49.625 --> 00:09:51.299
we have to set reduction targets

00:09:51.323 --> 00:09:54.434
and make sure that they're followed
all around the world.

00:09:54.458 --> 00:09:56.403
Because farmers compete with each other.

00:09:56.427 --> 00:09:57.776
And at a country level,

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.704
trading block or the global market,

00:09:59.728 --> 00:10:01.553
costs are very important.

00:10:01.577 --> 00:10:03.260
And also, we have to be realistic.

00:10:03.284 --> 00:10:05.458
Farmers need to have the possibilities

00:10:05.482 --> 00:10:08.672
to invest more in better
management and better feed

00:10:08.696 --> 00:10:10.505
in order to achieve this reduction.

00:10:11.474 --> 00:10:14.527
And besides legal limits,
the market can play a role,

00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:18.336
by offering antibiotic-reduced
or antibiotic-free products.

00:10:19.038 --> 00:10:21.180
And with growing consumer awareness,

00:10:21.204 --> 00:10:23.814
these market forces
will increase in power.

00:10:24.675 --> 00:10:27.960
Now everything I've been talking about
seems to be great for us.

00:10:27.984 --> 00:10:29.784
But what about the animals?

00:10:30.175 --> 00:10:32.476
Now, guess what,
their lives get better, too.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.233
Better health, less stress, happier life.

00:10:35.839 --> 00:10:37.156
So now you know.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:42.323
We have the knowledge
how to produce meat, eggs and milk

00:10:42.347 --> 00:10:45.735
without or with very low
amounts of antibiotics,

00:10:45.759 --> 00:10:48.308
and I'll argue it's a small price to pay

00:10:48.332 --> 00:10:51.430
to avoid a future
in which bacterial infections

00:10:51.454 --> 00:10:53.587
again become our biggest killer.

00:10:53.905 --> 00:10:55.078
Thank you.

00:10:55.102 --> 00:10:58.352
(Applause)
