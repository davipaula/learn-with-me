00:00:06.693 --> 00:00:09.031
Imagine yourself standing on a beach,

00:00:09.055 --> 00:00:11.215
looking out over the ocean,

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:13.229
waves crashing against the shore,

00:00:13.253 --> 00:00:16.427
blue as far as your eyes can see.

00:00:16.451 --> 00:00:18.190
Let it really sink in,

00:00:18.214 --> 00:00:20.886
the sheer scope and size of it all.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.703
Now, ask yourself,

00:00:22.727 --> 00:00:24.677
"How big is it?

00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:27.660
How big is the ocean?"

00:00:27.684 --> 00:00:29.373
First thing, we need to understand

00:00:29.397 --> 00:00:31.331
that there really is only one ocean,

00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:34.126
consisting of five component
basins that we call

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.210
the Pacific,

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:35.794
the Atlantic,

00:00:35.818 --> 00:00:36.461
the Indian,

00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:37.048
the Arctic,

00:00:37.072 --> 00:00:38.630
and the Southern.

00:00:38.654 --> 00:00:39.672
Each of these five,

00:00:39.696 --> 00:00:41.467
while generally referred to as oceans

00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:42.927
in and of themselves,

00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:44.512
are really and truly a part of

00:00:44.536 --> 00:00:46.645
a single, massive body of water,

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:47.707
one ocean,

00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:50.518
which defines the very
face of planet Earth.

00:00:50.542 --> 00:00:54.202
The ocean covers roughly 71%
of our planet's surface,

00:00:54.226 --> 00:00:57.373
some 360 million square kilometers,

00:00:57.397 --> 00:01:01.524
an area in excess
of the size of 36 U.S.A.'s.

00:01:01.548 --> 00:01:02.617
It's such a vast spread,

00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:03.994
when viewed from space,

00:01:04.018 --> 00:01:08.621
the ocean is, by far, the dominant
feature of our planet.

00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:09.872
Speaking of space,

00:01:09.896 --> 00:01:14.010
the ocean currently
holds over 1.3 billion,

00:01:14.034 --> 00:01:15.712
that's billion with a "b",

00:01:15.736 --> 00:01:17.627
cubic kilometers of water.

00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:18.673
Put another way,

00:01:18.697 --> 00:01:20.247
that's enough water to immerse

00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:22.207
the entire United States

00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:23.642
under a body of salt water

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:26.506
over 132 kilometers tall,

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.477
a height well beyond the reach
of the highest clouds

00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:32.985
and extending deep
into the upper atmosphere.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.195
With all that volume,

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.954
the ocean represents 97%

00:01:36.978 --> 00:01:39.689
of Earth's total water content.

00:01:39.713 --> 00:01:41.285
On top of all that,

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:44.342
the ocean contains upwards of 99%

00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:46.206
of the world's biosphere,

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.756
that is, the spaces
and places where life exists.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.879
Now let that sink in for a second.

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:54.173
The immediate world as we know it,

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:57.167
indeed the totality
of all the living space

00:01:57.191 --> 00:01:59.303
encompassed by the continents themselves,

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:03.767
all of that represents
only 1% of the biosphere.

00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:05.542
1%!

00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:08.687
The ocean is everything else.

00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:12.400
So, the ocean is physically massive.

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:16.001
It's importance to life
is practically unparalleled.

00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:17.957
It also happens to hold

00:02:17.981 --> 00:02:21.295
the greatest geological
features of our planet.

00:02:24.048 --> 00:02:27.650
Quickly, here are four
of the most notable.

00:02:27.674 --> 00:02:30.457
The ocean contains
the world's largest mountain range,

00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:32.086
the mid-ocean ridge.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.997
At roughly 65,000 kilometers long,

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:37.990
this underwater range is some 10 times

00:02:38.014 --> 00:02:39.980
longer than the longest mountain chain

00:02:40.004 --> 00:02:42.486
found purely on dry land, the Andes.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.393
Beneath the Denmark Strait exists

00:02:44.417 --> 00:02:47.056
the world's largest waterfall.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.438
This massive cataract
carries roughly 116 times

00:02:55.462 --> 00:02:58.344
more water per second over its edge

00:02:58.368 --> 00:03:00.316
than the Congo River's Inga Falls,

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.736
the largest waterfall by volume on land.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.618
The world's tallest mountain
is actually found in the ocean,

00:03:06.642 --> 00:03:08.241
hiding in plain sight.

00:03:08.265 --> 00:03:10.660
While 4200 meters of Hawaii's Mauna Kea

00:03:10.684 --> 00:03:12.619
sit above sea level,

00:03:12.643 --> 00:03:14.689
its sides plummet beneath the waves

00:03:14.713 --> 00:03:17.041
for another 5800 meters.

00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:18.459
From its snow-covered top

00:03:18.483 --> 00:03:20.630
to it's silt-covered bottom, then,

00:03:20.654 --> 00:03:23.805
this Hawaiian mountain is roughly
10,000 meters in height,

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.098
dwarfing tiny Everest's paltry peak

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:27.926
by well over a kilometer.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.081
Then, since we're picking on poor Everest,

00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:32.807
let's consider the world's deepest canyon,

00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:34.419
the Challenger Deep,

00:03:34.443 --> 00:03:37.354
existing 11 kilometers
below the ocean's surface,

00:03:37.378 --> 00:03:39.805
some six times deeper
than the Grand Canyon.

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.446
That's deep enough to sink
Mount Everest into

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.615
and still have over 2.1
kilometers of water

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.022
sitting atop its newly submerged peak.

00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:50.560
Put another way, the depth
of the Challenger Deep

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:52.145
is roughly the same height

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.231
that commercial airliners travel.

00:03:54.255 --> 00:03:56.877
So, pretty much however you
choose to slice it,

00:03:56.901 --> 00:03:58.918
the ocean is capital B

00:03:58.942 --> 00:03:59.737
capital I,

00:03:59.761 --> 00:04:00.868
capital G,

00:04:00.892 --> 00:04:02.025
BIG!

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.966
It defines our planet,

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.452
home to the greatest geological features,

00:04:06.476 --> 00:04:08.870
comprises the largest living space,

00:04:08.894 --> 00:04:11.498
and accordingly, is home
to the greatest numbers

00:04:11.522 --> 00:04:13.882
and forms of life on Earth.

00:04:13.906 --> 00:04:17.709
It is practically
incomprehensible in scope.

00:04:17.733 --> 00:04:20.628
But it is not so big,

00:04:20.652 --> 00:04:21.857
so vast,

00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:23.218
so extraordinary

00:04:23.242 --> 00:04:25.304
as to be untouchable.

00:04:25.328 --> 00:04:29.049
In fact, with roughly 50%
of the world's population

00:04:29.073 --> 00:04:31.698
living within 100
kilometers of the coastline

00:04:31.722 --> 00:04:33.696
and with most of the remainder

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.482
living close enough to lakes,
rivers, or swamps,

00:04:36.506 --> 00:04:38.963
all of which ultimately lead to the ocean,

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:41.548
virtually every single
person on the planet

00:04:41.572 --> 00:04:44.970
has the opportunity
to influence the general health

00:04:44.994 --> 00:04:47.520
and nature of the world ocean.

00:04:47.544 --> 00:04:49.211
Evidence of human influence is seen

00:04:49.235 --> 00:04:51.193
in every part of the ocean,

00:04:51.217 --> 00:04:52.456
no matter how deep,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.356
no matter how distant.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.249
The ocean defines our planet,

00:04:57.273 --> 00:04:59.391
but, in a very real sense,

00:04:59.415 --> 00:05:01.621
we define the ocean.
