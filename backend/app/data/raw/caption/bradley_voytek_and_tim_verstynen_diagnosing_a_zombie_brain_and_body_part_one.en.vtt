00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:22.120
(Zombie sounds) Doctor 1: So, how did it get to be this way?

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:28.304
Doctor 2: Well, it's my professional opinion that the large gaping bite mark on its shoulder might have something to do with it.

00:00:28.304 --> 00:00:34.037
D1: Thanks. I mean, what causes its behavioral abnormalities?

00:00:34.037 --> 00:00:36.754
D2: Well, we know all behaviors are rooted in the brain,

00:00:36.754 --> 00:00:40.737
so I'd expect that something's gone terribly wrong probably in there.

00:00:40.737 --> 00:00:43.588
D1: Thanks again, Doctor Obvious.

00:00:43.588 --> 00:00:45.405
Let me be more specific.

00:00:45.405 --> 00:00:49.603
What changes in the brain would have to occur in order to cause this kind of behavior?

00:00:49.603 --> 00:00:52.570
D2: Hmm. Well, let's see.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.170
The first thing I notice is how it moves.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.520
Stiff legged, with long, lumbering steps, very slow and awkward.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.457
Almost like what you'd see in Parkinson's disease.

00:01:03.457 --> 00:01:06.020
Maybe something's wrong with his basal ganglia?

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.937
Those are a collection of deep brain regions that regulate movement,

00:01:08.937 --> 00:01:11.371
through a neurochemical called dopamine.

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:15.370
Although most people think of dopamine as the "happy" chemical of the brain,

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.220
the dopamine-containing neurons in the basal ganglia die off in Parkinson's disease,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.904
that's what causes it.

00:01:20.904 --> 00:01:23.236
Makes it more and more difficult to initiate actions.

00:01:23.236 --> 00:01:25.319
D1: What?

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:28.870
Look again at how it moves. Stiff legs, long stance,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.104
These aren't Parkinsonian movements, Parkinson's patients take short, shuffling steps,

00:01:34.104 --> 00:01:36.289
and the posture's all wrong.

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.672
This looks to me like what happens when the cerebellum is damaged.

00:01:39.672 --> 00:01:44.904
The cerebellum's a little cauliflower-shaped area in the back of your head, but don't let its size fool you.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:48.738
That little guy contains almost half of the neurons in the entire brain.

00:01:48.738 --> 00:01:51.172
Patients who suffer degeneration from this region,

00:01:51.172 --> 00:01:54.020
something called spino-cerebellar ataxia,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.421
show a lack of coordination that results in stiff legs, wide stance, and a lumbering walk.

00:01:59.421 --> 00:02:01.886
My money's on the cerebellum.

00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:05.686
D2: TouchÃ©. OK. So we've nailed its motor problems.

00:02:05.686 --> 00:02:10.337
Now what about that whole groaning, lack of talking thing?

00:02:10.337 --> 00:02:15.987
D1: Hmm. You know, it sounds kind of like expressive aphasia, or Broca's aphasia,

00:02:15.987 --> 00:02:18.637
which makes producing words difficult.

00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:21.320
This is caused by damage to the inferior frontal gyrus,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.637
or possibly the anterior insula,

00:02:23.637 --> 00:02:27.487
both regions behind your temple on the left side of your head.

00:02:27.487 --> 00:02:32.171
D2: I think you're only half right. Zombies definitely can't communicate, that's for sure.

00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:35.820
But they don't seem to do a good job of understanding things either.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.404
Watch this. Hey, Walker! Your father smelt of elderberries!

00:02:41.404 --> 00:02:43.636
(Laughs) See? No reaction.

00:02:43.636 --> 00:02:47.919
Either it's not a Monty Python fan, or it can't understand me.

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:51.921
I'd say this is like spot-on fluent Wernicke's aphasia,

00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:56.339
damage to an area at the junction of two of the brain's lobes, temporal and parietal,

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:59.487
typically on the left side of the brain, is the culprit.

00:02:59.487 --> 00:03:02.754
This area is physically connected to Broca's area, that you mentioned,

00:03:02.754 --> 00:03:07.019
by a massive bundle of neurofibers called the arcuate fasciculus.

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.020
I hypothesize that this massive bundle of connections is completely wiped out in a zombie.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.369
It would be like taking out the superhighway between two cities.

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:17.069
One city that manufactures a product,

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.937
and the other that ships it out to the rest of the world.

00:03:19.937 --> 00:03:24.353
Without that highway, the product distribution just shuts down.

00:03:24.353 --> 00:03:28.237
D1: So, basically it's a moot point to reason with a zombie,

00:03:28.237 --> 00:03:31.303
since they can't understand you, let alone talk back.

00:03:31.303 --> 00:03:36.386
D2: (Laughs) I mean, you could try, man, but I'm going to stay on this side of the glass.
