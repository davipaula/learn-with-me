00:00:12.952 --> 00:00:14.714
I'm a meteorologist by degree,

00:00:14.738 --> 00:00:17.881
I have a bachelor's,
master's and PhD in physical meteorology,

00:00:17.905 --> 00:00:20.041
so I'm a meteorologist, card carrying.

00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:25.143
And so with that comes
four questions, always.

00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:27.723
This is one prediction
I will always get right.

00:00:27.747 --> 00:00:29.603
(Laughter)

00:00:29.627 --> 00:00:31.675
And those questions are,

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.183
"Marshall, what channel are you on?"

00:00:34.207 --> 00:00:36.024
(Laughter)

00:00:36.048 --> 00:00:38.889
"Dr. Shepherd, what's the weather
going to be tomorrow?"

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:39.913
(Laughter)

00:00:39.937 --> 00:00:41.524
And oh, I love this one:

00:00:41.548 --> 00:00:44.993
"My daughter is getting married
next September, it's an outdoor wedding.

00:00:45.017 --> 00:00:46.227
Is it going to rain?"

00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:47.633
(Laughter)

00:00:47.657 --> 00:00:50.562
Not kidding, I get those,
and I don't know the answer to that,

00:00:50.586 --> 00:00:52.186
the science isn't there.

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:56.088
But the one I get a lot these days is,

00:00:56.112 --> 00:01:00.964
"Dr. Shepherd, do you believe
in climate change?"

00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:04.037
"Do you believe in global warming?"

00:01:04.807 --> 00:01:08.506
Now, I have to gather myself
every time I get that question.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.292
Because it's an ill-posed question --

00:01:10.316 --> 00:01:12.316
science isn't a belief system.

00:01:12.911 --> 00:01:16.177
My son, he's 10 --
he believes in the tooth fairy.

00:01:16.998 --> 00:01:20.387
And he needs to get over that,
because I'm losing dollars, fast.

00:01:20.411 --> 00:01:22.728
(Laughter)

00:01:22.752 --> 00:01:24.577
But he believes in the tooth fairy.

00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:26.572
But consider this.

00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:29.909
Bank of America building,
there, in Atlanta.

00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:32.488
You never hear anyone say,

00:01:32.512 --> 00:01:35.091
"Do you believe, if you go
to the top of that building

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:37.369
and throw a ball off, it's going to fall?"

00:01:37.807 --> 00:01:41.141
You never hear that,
because gravity is a thing.

00:01:42.427 --> 00:01:44.712
So why don't we hear the question,

00:01:44.736 --> 00:01:46.541
"Do you believe in gravity?"

00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:48.423
But of course, we hear the question,

00:01:48.447 --> 00:01:50.780
"Do you believe in global warming?"

00:01:52.161 --> 00:01:54.573
Well, consider these facts.

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.895
The American Association
for the Advancement of Science, AAAS,

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:01.768
one of the leading
organizations in science,

00:02:01.792 --> 00:02:05.712
queried scientists and the public
on different science topics.

00:02:05.736 --> 00:02:06.935
Here are some of them:

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:10.886
genetically modified food,
animal research, human evolution.

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.209
And look at what the scientists
say about those,

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:16.947
the people that actually
study those topics, in red,

00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:19.598
versus the gray, what the public thinks.

00:02:19.622 --> 00:02:21.208
How did we get there?

00:02:21.982 --> 00:02:23.474
How did we get there?

00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:28.644
That scientists and the public
are so far apart on these science issues.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.656
Well, I'll come a little bit
closer to home for me,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.830
climate change.

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.231
Eighty-seven percent of scientists

00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:40.463
believe that humans are contributing
to climate change.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.717
But only 50 percent of the public?

00:02:45.323 --> 00:02:46.704
How did we get there?

00:02:46.728 --> 00:02:48.031
So it begs the question,

00:02:48.055 --> 00:02:52.792
what shapes perceptions about science?

00:02:54.655 --> 00:02:56.045
It's an interesting question

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.647
and one that I've been
thinking about quite a bit.

00:03:00.434 --> 00:03:05.100
I think that one thing that shapes
perceptions in the public, about science,

00:03:05.124 --> 00:03:07.314
is belief systems and biases.

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:09.775
Belief systems and biases.

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.399
Go with me for a moment.

00:03:12.005 --> 00:03:14.458
Because I want to talk
about three elements of that:

00:03:14.482 --> 00:03:18.155
confirmation bias, Dunning-Kruger effect

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:20.044
and cognitive dissonance.

00:03:20.068 --> 00:03:24.091
Now, these sound like big, fancy,
academic terms, and they are.

00:03:24.585 --> 00:03:28.212
But when I describe them,
you're going to be like, "Oh!

00:03:28.236 --> 00:03:31.969
I recognize that; I even know
somebody that does that."

00:03:33.355 --> 00:03:34.934
Confirmation bias.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.732
Finding evidence that supports
what we already believe.

00:03:40.756 --> 00:03:43.680
Now, we're probably all
a little bit guilty of that at times.

00:03:45.427 --> 00:03:46.966
Take a look at this.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.307
I'm on Twitter.

00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:50.735
And often, when it snows,

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:52.648
I'll get this tweet back to me.

00:03:52.672 --> 00:03:55.148
(Laughter)

00:03:55.172 --> 00:03:58.901
"Hey, Dr. Shepherd, I have 20 inches
of global warming in my yard,

00:03:58.925 --> 00:04:01.909
what are you guys
talking about, climate change?"

00:04:01.933 --> 00:04:03.671
I get that tweet a lot, actually.

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.846
It's a cute tweet,
it makes me chuckle as well.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.815
But it's oh, so fundamentally
scientifically flawed.

00:04:12.292 --> 00:04:13.850
Because it illustrates

00:04:13.874 --> 00:04:15.895
that the person tweeting
doesn't understand

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.021
the difference
between weather and climate.

00:04:19.466 --> 00:04:23.014
I often say, weather is your mood

00:04:23.038 --> 00:04:25.497
and climate is your personality.

00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:28.132
Think about that.

00:04:28.156 --> 00:04:30.600
Weather is your mood,
climate is your personality.

00:04:30.624 --> 00:04:34.609
Your mood today doesn't necessarily
tell me anything about your personality,

00:04:34.633 --> 00:04:37.403
nor does a cold day tell me anything
about climate change,

00:04:37.427 --> 00:04:39.427
or a hot day, for that matter.

00:04:41.974 --> 00:04:43.124
Dunning-Kruger.

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:46.671
Two scholars from Cornell
came up with the Dunning-Kruger effect.

00:04:46.695 --> 00:04:49.076
If you go look up
the peer-reviewed paper for this,

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.569
you will see all kinds
of fancy terminology:

00:04:51.593 --> 00:04:55.236
it's an illusory superiority complex,
thinking we know things.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.077
In other words, people think
they know more than they do.

00:04:59.553 --> 00:05:02.486
Or they underestimate
what they don't know.

00:05:02.847 --> 00:05:05.314
And then, there's cognitive dissonance.

00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:09.164
Cognitive dissonance is interesting.

00:05:09.538 --> 00:05:12.188
We just recently had Groundhog Day, right?

00:05:13.132 --> 00:05:15.853
Now, there's no better definition
of cognitive dissonance

00:05:15.877 --> 00:05:19.395
than intelligent people asking me
if a rodent's forecast is accurate.

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.150
(Laughter)

00:05:22.174 --> 00:05:24.721
But I get that, all of the time.

00:05:24.745 --> 00:05:25.999
(Laughter)

00:05:26.023 --> 00:05:29.626
But I also hear
about the Farmer's Almanac.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.846
We grew up on the Farmer's Almanac,
people are familiar with it.

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.671
The problem is, it's only
about 37 percent accurate,

00:05:37.695 --> 00:05:40.829
according to studies
at Penn State University.

00:05:43.458 --> 00:05:47.029
But we're in an era of science

00:05:47.053 --> 00:05:49.117
where we actually
can forecast the weather.

00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:52.562
And believe it or not, and I know
some of you are like, "Yeah, right,"

00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:55.609
we're about 90 percent accurate, or more,
with weather forecast.

00:05:55.633 --> 00:05:58.257
You just tend to remember
the occasional miss, you do.

00:05:58.281 --> 00:05:59.431
(Laughter)

00:06:02.263 --> 00:06:05.668
So confirmation bias,
Dunning-Kruger and cognitive dissonance.

00:06:05.692 --> 00:06:11.104
I think those shape biases and perceptions
that people have about science.

00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:13.774
But then, there's literacy
and misinformation

00:06:13.798 --> 00:06:15.865
that keep us boxed in, as well.

00:06:17.911 --> 00:06:20.395
During the hurricane season of 2017,

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:24.632
media outlets had to actually
assign reporters

00:06:24.656 --> 00:06:28.813
to dismiss fake information
about the weather forecast.

00:06:30.204 --> 00:06:32.138
That's the era that we're in.

00:06:32.644 --> 00:06:35.081
I deal with this all the time
in social media.

00:06:35.105 --> 00:06:36.692
Someone will tweet a forecast --

00:06:36.716 --> 00:06:39.652
that's a forecast for Hurricane Irma,
but here's the problem:

00:06:39.676 --> 00:06:41.676
it didn't come from the Hurricane Center.

00:06:42.608 --> 00:06:45.395
But people were tweeting
and sharing this; it went viral.

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:48.284
It didn't come from
the National Hurricane Center at all.

00:06:50.363 --> 00:06:52.847
So I spent 12 years of my career at NASA

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:54.903
before coming
to the University of Georgia,

00:06:54.927 --> 00:06:57.442
and I chair their Earth Science
Advisory Committee,

00:06:57.466 --> 00:06:59.283
I was just up there last week in DC.

00:06:59.307 --> 00:07:01.294
And I saw some really interesting things.

00:07:01.318 --> 00:07:04.556
Here's a NASA model
and science data from satellite

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.863
showing the 2017 hurricane season.

00:07:06.887 --> 00:07:08.953
You see Hurricane Harvey there?

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:12.158
Look at all the dust coming off of Africa.

00:07:12.617 --> 00:07:17.604
Look at the wildfires up in northwest US
and in western Canada.

00:07:17.628 --> 00:07:19.428
There comes Hurricane Irma.

00:07:20.923 --> 00:07:23.066
This is fascinating to me.

00:07:23.688 --> 00:07:25.783
But admittedly, I'm a weather geek.

00:07:26.982 --> 00:07:30.458
But more importantly, it illustrates
that we have the technology

00:07:30.482 --> 00:07:33.061
to not only observe the weather
and climate system,

00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:34.235
but predict it.

00:07:34.625 --> 00:07:36.387
There's scientific understanding,

00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:39.498
so there's no need for some
of those perceptions and biases

00:07:39.522 --> 00:07:41.092
that we've been talking about.

00:07:41.116 --> 00:07:42.315
We have knowledge.

00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:43.577
But think about this ...

00:07:43.601 --> 00:07:46.783
This is Houston, Texas,
after Hurricane Harvey.

00:07:47.736 --> 00:07:50.699
Now, I write a contribution
for "Forbes" magazine periodically,

00:07:50.733 --> 00:07:55.264
and I wrote an article a week before
Hurricane Harvey made landfall, saying,

00:07:55.288 --> 00:07:58.130
"There's probably going to be
40 to 50 inches of rainfall."

00:07:58.776 --> 00:08:01.260
I wrote that a week before it happened.

00:08:01.284 --> 00:08:03.410
But yet, when you talk
to people in Houston,

00:08:03.434 --> 00:08:06.507
people are saying, "We had no idea
it was going to be this bad."

00:08:07.093 --> 00:08:08.268
I'm just...

00:08:08.292 --> 00:08:09.473
(Sigh)

00:08:09.497 --> 00:08:10.633
(Laughter)

00:08:10.657 --> 00:08:11.831
A week before.

00:08:11.855 --> 00:08:13.045
But --

00:08:13.069 --> 00:08:15.567
I know, it's amusing, but the reality is,

00:08:15.591 --> 00:08:21.735
we all struggle with perceiving something
outside of our experience level.

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:24.029
People in Houston
get rain all of the time,

00:08:24.053 --> 00:08:25.853
they flood all of the time.

00:08:26.513 --> 00:08:28.847
But they've never experienced that.

00:08:29.561 --> 00:08:33.950
Houston gets about 34 inches of rainfall
for the entire year.

00:08:33.974 --> 00:08:36.529
They got 50 inches in three days.

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.391
That's an anomaly event,
that's outside of the normal.

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:45.029
So belief systems and biases,
literacy and misinformation.

00:08:45.053 --> 00:08:48.936
How do we step out of the boxes
that are cornering our perceptions?

00:08:50.633 --> 00:08:54.366
Well we don't even have to go to Houston,
we can come very close to home.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:55.571
(Laughter)

00:08:55.595 --> 00:08:57.508
Remember "Snowpocalypse?"

00:08:57.532 --> 00:08:59.333
(Laughter)

00:08:59.357 --> 00:09:00.857
Snowmageddon?

00:09:00.881 --> 00:09:02.032
Snowzilla?

00:09:02.056 --> 00:09:04.085
Whatever you want to call it.

00:09:04.109 --> 00:09:06.426
All two inches of it.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.053
(Laughter)

00:09:09.077 --> 00:09:11.942
Two inches of snow
shut the city of Atlanta down.

00:09:11.966 --> 00:09:13.537
(Laughter)

00:09:14.982 --> 00:09:19.236
But the reality is,
we were in a winter storm watch,

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.895
we went to a winter weather advisory,

00:09:21.919 --> 00:09:24.569
and a lot of people perceived that
as being a downgrade,

00:09:24.593 --> 00:09:26.260
"Oh, it's not going to be as bad."

00:09:26.284 --> 00:09:29.514
When in fact, the perception
was that it was not going to be as bad,

00:09:29.538 --> 00:09:31.172
but it was actually an upgrade.

00:09:31.196 --> 00:09:33.783
Things were getting worse
as the models were coming in.

00:09:33.807 --> 00:09:37.613
So that's an example of how we get
boxed in by our perceptions.

00:09:38.165 --> 00:09:40.141
So, the question becomes,

00:09:40.165 --> 00:09:43.656
how do we expand our radius?

00:09:45.823 --> 00:09:47.733
The area of a circle is "pi r squared".

00:09:47.757 --> 00:09:50.000
We increase the radius,
we increase the area.

00:09:50.024 --> 00:09:54.005
How do we expand our radius
of understanding about science?

00:09:54.593 --> 00:09:55.993
Here are my thoughts.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.791
You take inventory of your own biases.

00:09:59.815 --> 00:10:01.831
And I'm challenging you all to do that.

00:10:01.855 --> 00:10:04.879
Take an inventory of your own biases.

00:10:04.903 --> 00:10:06.188
Where do they come from?

00:10:06.212 --> 00:10:09.586
Your upbringing, your political
perspective, your faith --

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.029
what shapes your own biases?

00:10:13.982 --> 00:10:15.419
Then, evaluate your sources --

00:10:15.443 --> 00:10:17.894
where do you get
your information on science?

00:10:18.553 --> 00:10:20.529
What do you read, what do you listen to,

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:22.553
to consume your information on science?

00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:25.768
And then, it's important to speak out.

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:29.910
Talk about how you evaluated your biases
and evaluated your sources.

00:10:29.934 --> 00:10:32.704
I want you to listen to this
little 40-second clip

00:10:32.728 --> 00:10:37.506
from one of the top
TV meteorologists in the US, Greg Fishel,

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.053
in the Raleigh, Durham area.

00:10:39.077 --> 00:10:40.752
He's revered in that region.

00:10:40.776 --> 00:10:42.181
But he was a climate skeptic.

00:10:42.205 --> 00:10:44.442
But listen to what he says
about speaking out.

00:10:44.466 --> 00:10:46.202
Greg Fishel:
The mistake I was making

00:10:46.226 --> 00:10:48.180
and didn't realize until very recently,

00:10:48.204 --> 00:10:50.797
was that I was only looking
for information

00:10:50.821 --> 00:10:53.682
to support what I already thought,

00:10:53.706 --> 00:10:57.813
and was not interested
in listening to anything contrary.

00:10:58.559 --> 00:11:00.630
And so I woke up one morning,

00:11:00.654 --> 00:11:04.352
and there was this question in my mind,

00:11:04.918 --> 00:11:07.522
"Greg, are you engaging
in confirmation bias?

00:11:07.546 --> 00:11:11.471
Are you only looking for information
to support what you already think?"

00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:14.508
And if I was honest with myself,
and I tried to be,

00:11:14.522 --> 00:11:16.850
I admitted that was going on.

00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:19.783
And so the more I talked to scientists

00:11:19.807 --> 00:11:21.865
and read peer-reviewed literature

00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:26.601
and tried to conduct myself the way
I'd been taught to conduct myself

00:11:26.625 --> 00:11:28.958
at Penn State when I was a student,

00:11:29.665 --> 00:11:32.357
it became very difficult for me
to make the argument

00:11:32.381 --> 00:11:34.441
that we weren't at least
having some effect.

00:11:34.465 --> 00:11:36.901
Maybe there was still a doubt
as to how much,

00:11:36.925 --> 00:11:41.640
but to say "nothing" was not
a responsible thing for me to do

00:11:41.664 --> 00:11:43.464
as a scientist or a person.

00:11:45.387 --> 00:11:49.248
JMS: Greg Fishel just talked
about expanding his radius

00:11:49.272 --> 00:11:50.895
of understanding of science.

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:52.974
And when we expand our radius,

00:11:52.998 --> 00:11:56.196
it's not about making a better future,

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.287
but it's about preserving
life as we know it.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:05.134
So as we think about expanding
our own radius in understanding science,

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:09.664
it's critical for Athens, Georgia,
for Atlanta, Georgia,

00:12:09.688 --> 00:12:12.546
for the state of Georgia,
and for the world.

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:14.928
So expand your radius.

00:12:14.952 --> 00:12:16.135
Thank you.

00:12:16.159 --> 00:12:20.174
(Applause)
