00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.376
I saw a UFO once.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.296
I was eight or nine,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.656
playing in the street with a friend
who was a couple of years older,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.336
and we saw a featureless silver disc
hovering over the houses.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.136
We watched it for a few seconds,

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.416
and then it shot away incredibly quickly.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.656
Even as a kid,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.520
I got angry it was ignoring
the laws of physics.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.416
We ran inside to tell the grown-ups,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.016
and they were skeptical --

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.120
you'd be skeptical too, right?

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.856
I got my own back a few years later:

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.376
one of those grown-ups told me,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.216
"Last night I saw a flying saucer.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.816
I was coming out of the pub
after a few drinks."

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.656
I stopped him there.
I said, "I can explain that sighting."

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.696
(Laughter)

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.616
Psychologists have shown
we can't trust our brains

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.856
to tell the truth.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.696
It's easy to fool ourselves.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.336
I saw something,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.736
but what's more likely --

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.776
that I saw an alien spacecraft,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.720
or that my brain misinterpreted
the data my eyes were giving it?

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.776
Ever since though I've wondered:

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.816
Why don't we see
flying saucers flitting around?

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.056
At the very least,

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.936
why don't we see life
out there in the cosmos?

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.176
It's a puzzle,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.656
and I've discussed it
with dozens of experts

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.816
from different disciplines
over the past three decades.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.696
And there's no consensus.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.056
Frank Drake began searching
for alien signals back in 1960 --

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.976
so far, nothing.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.416
And with each passing year,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.976
this nonobservation,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.656
this lack of evidence
for any alien activity gets more puzzling

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.680
because we should see them, shouldn't we?

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.896
The universe is 13.8 billion years old,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.176
give or take.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.696
If we represent the age
of the universe by one year,

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.296
then our species came into being
about 12 minutes before midnight,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.560
31st December.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.776
Western civilization
has existed for a few seconds.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.520
Extraterrestrial civilizations
could have started in the summer months.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.336
Imagine a summer civilization

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.616
developing a level of technology
more advanced than ours,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.776
but tech based on accepted physics though,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.736
I'm not talking wormholes
or warp drives -- whatever --

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.280
just an extrapolation
of the sort of tech that TED celebrates.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.456
That civilization could program
self-replicating probes

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.120
to visit every planetary
system in the galaxy.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.360
If they launched the first probes
just after midnight one August day,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.456
then before breakfast same day,

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.600
they could have colonized the galaxy.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.216
Intergalactic colonization
isn't much more difficult,

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.480
it just takes longer.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.016
A civilization from any one
of millions of galaxies

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.400
could have colonized our galaxy.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.696
Seems far-fetched?

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.936
Maybe it is,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.056
but wouldn't aliens engage
in some recognizable activity --

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.336
put worldlets around a star
to capture free sunlight,

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.536
collaborate on a Wikipedia Galactica,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.480
or just shout out
to the universe, "We're here"?

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.120
So where is everybody?

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.176
It's a puzzle because we do expect
these civilizations to exist, don't we?

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.376
After all, there could be
a trillion planets in the galaxy --

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.760
maybe more.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.976
You don't need any special knowledge
to consider this question,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.896
and I've explored it
with lots of people over the years.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.896
And I've found they often
frame their thinking

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.016
in terms of the barriers
that would need to be cleared

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.280
if a planet is to host
a communicative civilization.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.936
And they usually identify
four key barriers.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.336
Habitability --

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.776
that's the first barrier.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.416
We need a terrestrial planet
in that just right "Goldilocks zone,"

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.680
where water flows as a liquid.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.656
They're out there.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.256
In 2016, astronomers confirmed
there's a planet in the habitable zone

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.736
of the closest star,

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.536
Proxima Centauri --

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.616
so close that Breakthrough Starshot
project plans to send probes there.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.520
We'd become a starfaring species.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.096
But not all worlds are habitable.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.456
Some will be too close to a star
and they'll fry,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.600
some will be too far away
and they'll freeze.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.016
Abiogenesis --

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.815
the creation of life from nonlife --

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:33.120
that's the second barrier.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.896
The basic building blocks of life
aren't unique to Earth:

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.656
amino acids have been found in comets,

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.776
complex organic molecules
in interstellar dust clouds,

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.400
water in exoplanetary systems.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.416
The ingredients are there,

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.096
we just don't know
how they combine to create life,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.280
and presumably there will be worlds
on which life doesn't start.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.520
The development of technological
civilization is a third barrier.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.376
Some say we already share our planet
with alien intelligences.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.200
A 2011 study showed that elephants
can cooperate to solve problems.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.376
A 2010 study showed

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.680
that an octopus in captivity
can recognize different humans.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.256
2017 studies show that ravens
can plan for future events --

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.016
wonderful, clever creatures --

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.256
but they can't contemplate
the Breakthrough Starshot project,

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.536
and if we vanished today,

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.416
they wouldn't go on
to implement Breakthrough Starshot --

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.816
why should they?

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.600
Evolution doesn't have
space travel as an end goal.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.720
There will be worlds where life
doesn't give rise to advanced technology.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.896
Communication across space --
that's a fourth barrier.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.696
Maybe advanced civilizations
choose to explore inner space

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.056
rather than outer space,

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.600
or engineer at small distances
rather than large.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.456
Or maybe they just don't want
to risk an encounter

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.616
with a potentially more advanced
and hostile neighbor.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.816
There'll be worlds where,
for whatever reason,

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.480
civilizations either stay silent
or don't spend long trying to communicate.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.696
As for the height of the barriers,

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.120
your guess is as good as anyone's.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.336
In my experience,

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.416
when people sit down and do the math,

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.320
they typically conclude there are
thousands of civilizations in the galaxy.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.360
But then we're back to the puzzle:
Where is everybody?

00:06:32.055 --> 00:06:33.416
By definition,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.776
UFOs -- including the one I saw --

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.096
are unidentified.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.856
We can't simply infer they're spacecraft.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.360
You can still have some fun
playing with the idea aliens are here.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.856
Some say a summer civilization
did colonize the galaxy

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.880
and seeded Earth with life ...

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.656
others, that we're living
in a cosmic wilderness preserve --

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.920
a zoo.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.976
Yet others --

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.176
that we're living in a simulation.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.520
Programmers just haven't
revealed the aliens yet.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.016
Most of my colleagues though
argue that E.T. is out there,

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.656
we just need to keep looking,

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.256
and this makes sense.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.056
Space is vast.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.896
Identifying a signal is hard,

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.520
and we haven't been looking that long.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.296
Without doubt, we should
spend more on the search.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.656
It's about understanding
our place in the universe.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.000
It's too important a question to ignore.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.936
But there's an obvious answer:

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.256
we're alone.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.896
It's just us.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.416
There could be a trillion
planets in the galaxy.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.920
Is it plausible we're the only creatures
capable of contemplating this question?

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.456
Well, yes, because in this context,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.840
we don't know whether
a trillion is a big number.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.336
In 2000, Peter Ward and Don Brownlee
proposed the Rare Earth idea.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.176
Remember those four barriers

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.056
that people use to estimate
the number of civilizations?

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.200
Ward and Brownlee said
there might be more.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.536
Let's look at one possible barrier.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.216
It's a recent suggestion by David Waltham,

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.480
a geophysicist.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.456
This is my very simplified version

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.080
of Dave's much more
sophisticated argument.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.256
We are able to be here now

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.936
because Earth's previous
inhabitants enjoyed

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.136
four billion years of good weather --

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.800
ups and downs but more or less clement.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.456
But long-term climate
stability is strange,

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.896
if only because astronomical influences

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.976
can push a planet
towards freezing or frying.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.176
There's a hint our moon has helped,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.376
and that's interesting

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.056
because the prevailing theory is

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.576
that the moon came into being when Theia,

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.216
a body the size of Mars,

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.976
crashed into a newly formed Earth.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.120
The outcome of that crash could have been
a quite different Earth-Moon system.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.376
We ended up with a large moon

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.256
and that permitted Earth
to have both a stable axial tilt

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.456
and a slow rotation rate.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.136
Both factors influence climate

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.760
and the suggestion is that they've helped
moderate climate change.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.680
Great for us, right?

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.096
But Waltham showed that if the moon
were just a few miles bigger,

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.736
things would be different.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.096
Earth's spin axis
would now wander chaotically.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.016
There'd be episodes
of rapid climate change --

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.416
not good for complex life.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.656
The moon is just the right size:

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.736
big but not too big.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.176
A "Goldilocks" moon around
a "Goldilocks" planet --

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.720
a barrier perhaps.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.016
You can imagine more barriers.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.256
For instance,

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.320
simple cells came into being
billions of years ago ...

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.776
but perhaps the development
of complex life

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.696
needed a series of unlikely events.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.296
Once life on Earth
had access to multicellularity

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.376
and sophisticated genetic structures,

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.656
and sex,

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.216
new opportunities opened up:

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.600
animals became possible.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.056
But maybe it's the fate of many planets

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.920
for life to settle
at the level of simple cells.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.856
Purely for the purposes of illustration,

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.936
let me suggest four more barriers
to add to the four

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.880
that people said blocked the path
to communicative civilization.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.016
Again, purely for the purposes
of illustration,

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:25.296
suppose there's a one-in-a-thousand chance
of making it across each of the barriers.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.456
Of course there might be
different ways of navigating the barriers,

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.256
and some chances will be better
than one in a thousand.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.136
Equally, there might be more barriers

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.416
and some chances
might be one in a million.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.520
Let's just see
what happens in this picture.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.696
If the galaxy contains a trillion planets,

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:47.216
how many will host a civilization
capable of contemplating like us

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.440
projects such as Breakthrough Starshot?

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.736
Habitability --

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:54.576
right sort of planet
around the right sort of star --

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.936
the trillion becomes a billion.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.296
Stability --

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.736
a climate that stays benign for eons --

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.616
the billion becomes a million.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.840
Life must start --

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.816
the million becomes a thousand.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.096
Complex life forms must arise --

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.696
the thousand becomes one.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.576
Sophisticated tool use must develop --

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.600
that's one planet in a thousand galaxies.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.056
To understand the universe,

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.296
they'll have to develop the techniques
of science and mathematics --

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.416
that's one planet in a million galaxies.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.096
To reach the stars,
they'll have to be social creatures,

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.936
capable of discussing
abstract concepts with each other

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.856
using complex grammar --

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.096
one planet in a billion galaxies.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.856
And they have to avoid disaster --

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.936
not just self-inflicted
but from the skies, too.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.896
That planet around Proxima Centauri,

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.240
last year it got blasted by a flare.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.136
One planet in a trillion galaxies,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.920
just as in the visible universe.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:55.680
I think we're alone.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.536
Those colleagues of mine
who agree we're alone

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.696
often see a barrier ahead --

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.976
bioterror,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.560
global warming, war.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.336
A universe that's silent

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.776
because technology itself
forms the barrier

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.736
to the development
of a truly advanced civilization.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.200
Depressing, right?

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.920
I'm arguing the exact opposite.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.136
I grew up watching "Star Trek"
and "Forbidden Planet,"

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.936
and I saw a UFO once,

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:33.040
so this idea of cosmic loneliness
I certainly find slightly wistful.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.336
But for me,

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.296
the silence of the universe is shouting,

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.040
"We're the creatures who got lucky."

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.656
All barriers are behind us.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:45.096
We're the only species
that's cleared them --

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.536
the only species capable
of determining its own destiny.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.760
And if we learn to appreciate
how special our planet is,

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.976
how important it is to look after our home

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.816
and to find others,

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.656
how incredibly fortunate we all are
simply to be aware of the universe,

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.016
humanity might survive for a while.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.696
And all those amazing things

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.576
we dreamed aliens
might have done in the past,

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.800
that could be our future.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.896
Thank you very much.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.440
(Applause)
