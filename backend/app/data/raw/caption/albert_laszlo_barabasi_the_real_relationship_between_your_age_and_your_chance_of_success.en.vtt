00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:14.515
Today, actually, is
a very special day for me,

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.660
because it is my birthday.

00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:20.657
(Applause)

00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:24.122
And so, thanks to all of you
for joining the party.

00:00:24.146 --> 00:00:25.313
(Laughter)

00:00:25.337 --> 00:00:30.123
But every time you throw a party,
there's someone there to spoil it. Right?

00:00:30.147 --> 00:00:31.219
(Laughter)

00:00:31.243 --> 00:00:32.602
And I'm a physicist,

00:00:32.626 --> 00:00:36.783
and this time I brought
another physicist along to do so.

00:00:36.807 --> 00:00:41.369
His name is Albert Einstein --
also Albert -- and he's the one who said

00:00:41.393 --> 00:00:46.223
that the person who has not made
his great contributions to science

00:00:46.247 --> 00:00:47.806
by the age of 30

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.226
will never do so.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.262
(Laughter)

00:00:50.286 --> 00:00:52.626
Now, you don't need to check Wikipedia

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.221
that I'm beyond 30.

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:55.661
(Laughter)

00:00:55.685 --> 00:00:59.291
So, effectively, what
he is telling me, and us,

00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:01.859
is that when it comes to my science,

00:01:01.883 --> 00:01:03.086
I'm deadwood.

00:01:04.078 --> 00:01:09.664
Well, luckily, I had my share
of luck within my career.

00:01:10.132 --> 00:01:13.954
Around age 28, I became
very interested in networks,

00:01:13.978 --> 00:01:18.054
and a few years later, we managed
to publish a few key papers

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:22.175
that reported the discovery
of scale-free networks

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:26.777
and really gave birth to a new discipline
that we call network science today.

00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:30.479
And if you really care about it,
you can get a PhD now in network science

00:01:30.503 --> 00:01:32.531
in Budapest, in Boston,

00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:34.863
and you can study it all over the world.

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:37.061
A few years later,

00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:40.315
when I moved to Harvard
first as a sabbatical,

00:01:40.339 --> 00:01:43.431
I became interested
in another type of network:

00:01:43.455 --> 00:01:46.482
that time, the networks within ourselves,

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:50.232
how the genes and the proteins
and the metabolites link to each other

00:01:50.256 --> 00:01:52.749
and how they connect to disease.

00:01:53.368 --> 00:01:57.960
And that interest led
to a major explosion within medicine,

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:01.963
including the Network Medicine
Division at Harvard,

00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:05.382
that has more than 300 researchers
who are using this perspective

00:02:05.406 --> 00:02:08.303
to treat patients and develop new cures.

00:02:09.457 --> 00:02:11.227
And a few years ago,

00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:13.777
I thought that I would take
this idea of networks

00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:15.567
and the expertise we had in networks

00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:16.983
in a different area,

00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:18.989
that is, to understand success.

00:02:19.704 --> 00:02:20.914
And why did we do that?

00:02:20.938 --> 00:02:23.219
Well, we thought that, to some degree,

00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:26.620
our success is determined
by the networks we're part of --

00:02:26.644 --> 00:02:30.491
that our networks can push us forward,
they can pull us back.

00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:35.053
And I was curious if we could use
the knowledge and big data and expertise

00:02:35.077 --> 00:02:36.480
where we develop the networks

00:02:36.504 --> 00:02:39.800
to really quantify
how these things happen.

00:02:40.404 --> 00:02:41.746
This is a result from that.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.717
What you see here is a network
of galleries in museums

00:02:44.741 --> 00:02:46.373
that connect to each other.

00:02:46.806 --> 00:02:50.861
And through this map
that we mapped out last year,

00:02:50.885 --> 00:02:55.733
we are able to predict very accurately
the success of an artist

00:02:55.757 --> 00:02:59.778
if you give me the first five exhibits
that he or she had in their career.

00:03:01.404 --> 00:03:04.110
Well, as we thought about success,

00:03:04.134 --> 00:03:07.201
we realized that success
is not only about networks;

00:03:07.225 --> 00:03:09.621
there are so many
other dimensions to that.

00:03:10.145 --> 00:03:13.392
And one of the things
we need for success, obviously,

00:03:13.416 --> 00:03:14.586
is performance.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.114
So let's define what's the difference
between performance and success.

00:03:18.465 --> 00:03:20.462
Well, performance is what you do:

00:03:20.486 --> 00:03:23.518
how fast you run,
what kind of paintings you paint,

00:03:23.542 --> 00:03:25.423
what kind of papers you publish.

00:03:25.835 --> 00:03:28.449
However, in our working definition,

00:03:28.473 --> 00:03:32.678
success is about what the community
notices from what you did,

00:03:32.702 --> 00:03:34.314
from your performance:

00:03:34.338 --> 00:03:38.470
How does it acknowledge it,
and how does it reward you for it?

00:03:38.494 --> 00:03:39.676
In other terms,

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.296
your performance is about you,
but your success is about all of us.

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:48.726
And this was a very
important shift for us,

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.774
because the moment we defined success
as being a collective measure

00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:54.904
that the community provides to us,

00:03:54.928 --> 00:03:56.438
it became measurable,

00:03:56.462 --> 00:04:00.972
because if it's in the community,
there are multiple data points about that.

00:04:00.996 --> 00:04:06.276
So we go to school,
we exercise, we practice,

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.291
because we believe
that performance leads to success.

00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:11.847
But the way we actually
started to explore,

00:04:11.871 --> 00:04:15.398
we realized that performance and success
are very, very different animals

00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:17.866
when it comes to
the mathematics of the problem.

00:04:18.429 --> 00:04:19.861
And let me illustrate that.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.276
So what you see here is
the fastest man on earth, Usain Bolt.

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:29.742
And of course, he wins most of
the competitions that he enters.

00:04:30.393 --> 00:04:33.568
And we know he's the fastest on earth
because we have a chronometer

00:04:33.592 --> 00:04:34.752
to measure his speed.

00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:38.895
Well, what is interesting about him
is that when he wins,

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.421
he doesn't do so by really significantly
outrunning his competition.

00:04:44.445 --> 00:04:48.964
He's running at most a percent faster
than the one who loses the race.

00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:53.269
And not only does he run only
one percent faster than the second one,

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:56.142
but he doesn't run
10 times faster than I do --

00:04:56.166 --> 00:04:58.347
and I'm not a good runner,
trust me on that.

00:04:58.371 --> 00:04:59.568
(Laughter)

00:04:59.592 --> 00:05:03.094
And every time we are able
to measure performance,

00:05:03.118 --> 00:05:05.168
we notice something very interesting;

00:05:05.192 --> 00:05:07.703
that is, performance is bounded.

00:05:07.727 --> 00:05:11.484
What it means is that there are
no huge variations in human performance.

00:05:11.508 --> 00:05:14.940
It varies only in a narrow range,

00:05:14.964 --> 00:05:18.243
and we do need the chronometer
to measure the differences.

00:05:18.267 --> 00:05:21.435
This is not to say that we cannot
see the good from the best ones,

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:24.192
but the best ones
are very hard to distinguish.

00:05:24.216 --> 00:05:27.208
And the problem with that
is that most of us work in areas

00:05:27.232 --> 00:05:31.154
where we do not have a chronometer
to gauge our performance.

00:05:31.178 --> 00:05:32.742
Alright, performance is bounded,

00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:36.298
there are no huge differences between us
when it comes to our performance.

00:05:36.322 --> 00:05:37.479
How about success?

00:05:37.995 --> 00:05:40.925
Well, let's switch to
a different topic, like books.

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.964
One measure of success for writers is
how many people read your work.

00:05:46.662 --> 00:05:51.072
And so when my previous book
came out in 2009,

00:05:51.096 --> 00:05:52.998
I was in Europe talking with my editor,

00:05:53.022 --> 00:05:55.484
and I was interested:
Who is the competition?

00:05:56.253 --> 00:05:58.988
And I had some fabulous ones.

00:05:59.012 --> 00:06:00.181
That week --

00:06:00.205 --> 00:06:01.229
(Laughter)

00:06:01.253 --> 00:06:04.810
Dan Brown came out with "The Lost Symbol,"

00:06:04.834 --> 00:06:07.816
and "The Last Song" also came out,

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.269
Nicholas Sparks.

00:06:09.293 --> 00:06:12.281
And when you just look at the list,

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:15.758
you realize, you know, performance-wise,
there's hardly any difference

00:06:15.782 --> 00:06:17.380
between these books or mine.

00:06:17.404 --> 00:06:18.579
Right?

00:06:18.603 --> 00:06:23.271
So maybe if Nicholas Sparks's team
works a little harder,

00:06:23.295 --> 00:06:25.017
he could easily be number one,

00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:27.939
because it's almost by accident
who ended up at the top.

00:06:28.486 --> 00:06:31.639
So I said, let's look at the numbers --
I'm a data person, right?

00:06:31.663 --> 00:06:35.981
So let's see what were
the sales for Nicholas Sparks.

00:06:36.005 --> 00:06:38.059
And it turns out that
that opening weekend,

00:06:38.083 --> 00:06:41.058
Nicholas Sparks sold more than
a hundred thousand copies,

00:06:41.082 --> 00:06:42.787
which is an amazing number.

00:06:42.811 --> 00:06:46.207
You can actually get to the top
of the "New York Times" best-seller list

00:06:46.231 --> 00:06:48.341
by selling 10,000 copies a week,

00:06:48.365 --> 00:06:52.117
so he tenfold overcame
what he needed to be number one.

00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:53.571
Yet he wasn't number one.

00:06:53.595 --> 00:06:54.903
Why?

00:06:54.927 --> 00:06:59.005
Because there was Dan Brown,
who sold 1.2 million copies that weekend.

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:01.165
(Laughter)

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:05.160
And the reason I like this number
is because it shows that, really,

00:07:05.184 --> 00:07:08.914
when it comes to success, it's unbounded,

00:07:08.938 --> 00:07:14.799
that the best doesn't only get
slightly more than the second best

00:07:14.823 --> 00:07:17.520
but gets orders of magnitude more,

00:07:17.544 --> 00:07:20.338
because success is a collective measure.

00:07:20.362 --> 00:07:24.738
We give it to them, rather than
we earn it through our performance.

00:07:24.762 --> 00:07:30.138
So one of things we realized is that
performance, what we do, is bounded,

00:07:30.162 --> 00:07:32.844
but success, which is
collective, is unbounded,

00:07:32.868 --> 00:07:34.180
which makes you wonder:

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:37.115
How do you get these
huge differences in success

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:40.045
when you have such tiny
differences in performance?

00:07:40.537 --> 00:07:44.324
And recently, I published a book
that I devoted to that very question.

00:07:44.348 --> 00:07:47.187
And they didn't give me enough time
to go over all of that,

00:07:47.211 --> 00:07:49.282
so I'm going to go back
to the question of,

00:07:49.306 --> 00:07:52.441
alright, you have success;
when should that appear?

00:07:52.465 --> 00:07:56.223
So let's go back to the party spoiler
and ask ourselves:

00:07:57.215 --> 00:08:00.554
Why did Einstein make
this ridiculous statement,

00:08:00.578 --> 00:08:03.734
that only before 30
you could actually be creative?

00:08:03.758 --> 00:08:08.438
Well, because he looked around himself
and he saw all these fabulous physicists

00:08:08.462 --> 00:08:11.049
that created quantum mechanics
and modern physics,

00:08:11.073 --> 00:08:14.809
and they were all in their 20s
and early 30s when they did so.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:16.950
And it's not only him.

00:08:16.974 --> 00:08:18.597
It's not only observational bias,

00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:22.618
because there's actually
a whole field of genius research

00:08:22.642 --> 00:08:24.898
that has documented the fact that,

00:08:24.922 --> 00:08:28.082
if we look at the people
we admire from the past

00:08:28.106 --> 00:08:31.464
and then look at what age
they made their biggest contribution,

00:08:31.488 --> 00:08:33.584
whether that's music,
whether that's science,

00:08:33.608 --> 00:08:35.227
whether that's engineering,

00:08:35.251 --> 00:08:41.374
most of them tend to do so
in their 20s, 30s, early 40s at most.

00:08:41.914 --> 00:08:44.705
But there's a problem
with this genius research.

00:08:45.197 --> 00:08:48.477
Well, first of all, it created
the impression to us

00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:51.980
that creativity equals youth,

00:08:52.004 --> 00:08:53.614
which is painful, right?

00:08:53.638 --> 00:08:55.589
(Laughter)

00:08:55.613 --> 00:08:59.701
And it also has an observational bias,

00:08:59.725 --> 00:09:04.687
because it only looks at geniuses
and doesn't look at ordinary scientists

00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.676
and doesn't look at all of us and ask,

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.885
is it really true that creativity
vanishes as we age?

00:09:10.382 --> 00:09:12.259
So that's exactly what we tried to do,

00:09:12.283 --> 00:09:16.086
and this is important for that
to actually have references.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:18.753
So let's look at an ordinary
scientist like myself,

00:09:18.777 --> 00:09:20.299
and let's look at my career.

00:09:20.323 --> 00:09:23.525
So what you see here is all the papers
that I've published

00:09:23.549 --> 00:09:28.664
from my very first paper, in 1989;
I was still in Romania when I did so,

00:09:28.688 --> 00:09:30.281
till kind of this year.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.458
And vertically, you see
the impact of the paper,

00:09:33.482 --> 00:09:34.885
that is, how many citations,

00:09:34.909 --> 00:09:38.897
how many other papers
have been written that cited that work.

00:09:39.397 --> 00:09:40.697
And when you look at that,

00:09:40.721 --> 00:09:43.534
you see that my career
has roughly three different stages.

00:09:43.558 --> 00:09:45.993
I had the first 10 years
where I had to work a lot

00:09:46.017 --> 00:09:47.293
and I don't achieve much.

00:09:47.317 --> 00:09:49.435
No one seems to care
about what I do, right?

00:09:49.459 --> 00:09:51.140
There's hardly any impact.

00:09:51.164 --> 00:09:52.568
(Laughter)

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:55.479
That time, I was doing material science,

00:09:55.503 --> 00:09:59.194
and then I kind of discovered
for myself networks

00:09:59.218 --> 00:10:01.165
and then started publishing in networks.

00:10:01.189 --> 00:10:04.262
And that led from one high-impact
paper to the other one.

00:10:04.286 --> 00:10:07.390
And it really felt good.
That was that stage of my career.

00:10:07.414 --> 00:10:08.696
(Laughter)

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.928
So the question is,
what happens right now?

00:10:12.587 --> 00:10:15.826
And we don't know, because there
hasn't been enough time passed yet

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.837
to actually figure out how much impact
those papers will get;

00:10:18.861 --> 00:10:20.088
it takes time to acquire.

00:10:20.112 --> 00:10:21.681
Well, when you look at the data,

00:10:21.705 --> 00:10:24.559
it seems to be that Einstein,
the genius research, is right,

00:10:24.583 --> 00:10:26.394
and I'm at that stage of my career.

00:10:26.418 --> 00:10:28.726
(Laughter)

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:34.724
So we said, OK, let's figure out
how does this really happen,

00:10:34.748 --> 00:10:36.526
first in science.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.182
And in order not to have
the selection bias,

00:10:40.206 --> 00:10:41.543
to look only at geniuses,

00:10:41.567 --> 00:10:45.283
we ended up reconstructing the career
of every single scientist

00:10:45.307 --> 00:10:47.809
from 1900 till today

00:10:47.833 --> 00:10:51.545
and finding for all scientists
what was their personal best,

00:10:51.569 --> 00:10:54.381
whether they got the Nobel Prize
or they never did,

00:10:54.405 --> 00:10:57.812
or no one knows what they did,
even their personal best.

00:10:57.836 --> 00:10:59.751
And that's what you see in this slide.

00:10:59.775 --> 00:11:01.348
Each line is a career,

00:11:01.372 --> 00:11:04.375
and when you have a light blue dot
on the top of that career,

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:06.439
it says that was their personal best.

00:11:06.463 --> 00:11:07.618
And the question is,

00:11:07.642 --> 00:11:11.210
when did they actually make
their biggest discovery?

00:11:11.234 --> 00:11:12.399
To quantify that,

00:11:12.423 --> 00:11:15.799
we look at what's the probability
that you make your biggest discovery,

00:11:15.823 --> 00:11:18.495
let's say, one, two, three
or 10 years into your career?

00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:19.999
We're not looking at real age.

00:11:20.023 --> 00:11:22.157
We're looking at
what we call "academic age."

00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:25.431
Your academic age starts
when you publish your first papers.

00:11:25.455 --> 00:11:27.234
I know some of you are still babies.

00:11:27.258 --> 00:11:28.655
(Laughter)

00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:31.385
So let's look at the probability

00:11:31.409 --> 00:11:33.475
that you publish
your highest-impact paper.

00:11:33.499 --> 00:11:36.570
And what you see is, indeed,
the genius research is right.

00:11:36.594 --> 00:11:39.618
Most scientists tend to publish
their highest-impact paper

00:11:39.642 --> 00:11:42.541
in the first 10, 15 years in their career,

00:11:42.565 --> 00:11:45.698
and it tanks after that.

00:11:45.722 --> 00:11:50.829
It tanks so fast that I'm about --
I'm exactly 30 years into my career,

00:11:50.853 --> 00:11:54.393
and the chance that I will publish a paper
that would have a higher impact

00:11:54.417 --> 00:11:56.357
than anything that I did before

00:11:56.381 --> 00:11:57.734
is less than one percent.

00:11:57.758 --> 00:12:00.807
I am in that stage of my career,
according to this data.

00:12:01.648 --> 00:12:03.491
But there's a problem with that.

00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:07.190
We're not doing controls properly.

00:12:07.214 --> 00:12:08.631
So the control would be,

00:12:08.655 --> 00:12:13.262
what would a scientist look like
who makes random contribution to science?

00:12:13.286 --> 00:12:16.281
Or what is the productivity
of the scientist?

00:12:16.305 --> 00:12:18.311
When do they write papers?

00:12:18.335 --> 00:12:20.779
So we measured the productivity,

00:12:20.803 --> 00:12:22.855
and amazingly, the productivity,

00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:27.010
your likelihood of writing a paper
in year one, 10 or 20 in your career,

00:12:27.034 --> 00:12:30.640
is indistinguishable from the likelihood
of having the impact

00:12:30.664 --> 00:12:32.439
in that part of your career.

00:12:33.026 --> 00:12:34.809
And to make a long story short,

00:12:34.833 --> 00:12:39.061
after lots of statistical tests,
there's only one explanation for that,

00:12:39.085 --> 00:12:41.979
that really, the way we scientists work

00:12:42.003 --> 00:12:45.636
is that every single paper we write,
every project we do,

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.820
has exactly the same chance
of being our personal best.

00:12:49.844 --> 00:12:54.797
That is, discovery is like
a lottery ticket.

00:12:54.821 --> 00:12:57.172
And the more lottery tickets we buy,

00:12:57.196 --> 00:12:58.703
the higher our chances.

00:12:58.727 --> 00:13:00.286
And it happens to be so

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:03.029
that most scientists buy
most of their lottery tickets

00:13:03.053 --> 00:13:05.513
in the first 10, 15 years of their career,

00:13:05.537 --> 00:13:08.950
and after that,
their productivity decreases.

00:13:09.411 --> 00:13:11.495
They're not buying
any more lottery tickets.

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:14.963
So it looks as if
they would not be creative.

00:13:14.987 --> 00:13:16.986
In reality, they stopped trying.

00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:21.424
So when we actually put the data together,
the conclusion is very simple:

00:13:21.448 --> 00:13:23.779
success can come at any time.

00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:27.538
It could be your very first
or very last paper of your career.

00:13:27.562 --> 00:13:31.850
It's totally random
in the space of the projects.

00:13:31.874 --> 00:13:33.805
It is the productivity that changes.

00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:35.081
Let me illustrate that.

00:13:35.105 --> 00:13:38.374
Here is Frank Wilczek,
who got the Nobel Prize in Physics

00:13:38.398 --> 00:13:42.499
for the very first paper he ever wrote
in his career as a graduate student.

00:13:42.523 --> 00:13:43.530
(Laughter)

00:13:43.554 --> 00:13:46.772
More interesting is John Fenn,

00:13:46.796 --> 00:13:51.394
who, at age 70, was forcefully retired
by Yale University.

00:13:51.418 --> 00:13:53.474
They shut his lab down,

00:13:53.498 --> 00:13:57.164
and at that moment, he moved
to Virginia Commonwealth University,

00:13:57.188 --> 00:13:58.974
opened another lab,

00:13:58.998 --> 00:14:02.031
and it is there, at age 72,
that he published a paper

00:14:02.055 --> 00:14:05.900
for which, 15 years later, he got
the Nobel Prize for Chemistry.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.982
And you think, OK,
well, science is special,

00:14:10.006 --> 00:14:13.469
but what about other areas
where we need to be creative?

00:14:13.493 --> 00:14:18.429
So let me take another
typical example: entrepreneurship.

00:14:18.834 --> 00:14:20.413
Silicon Valley,

00:14:20.437 --> 00:14:22.503
the land of the youth, right?

00:14:22.527 --> 00:14:24.122
And indeed, when you look at it,

00:14:24.146 --> 00:14:28.788
you realize that the biggest awards,
the TechCrunch Awards and other awards,

00:14:28.812 --> 00:14:30.985
are all going to people

00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:36.024
whose average age
is late 20s, very early 30s.

00:14:36.465 --> 00:14:42.067
You look at who the VCs give the money to,
some of the biggest VC firms --

00:14:42.091 --> 00:14:44.332
all people in their early 30s.

00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:46.216
Which, of course, we know;

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.693
there is this ethos in Silicon Valley
that youth equals success.

00:14:51.653 --> 00:14:53.836
Not when you look at the data,

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.164
because it's not only
about forming a company --

00:14:56.188 --> 00:14:59.328
forming a company is like productivity,
trying, trying, trying --

00:14:59.352 --> 00:15:02.836
when you look at which
of these individuals actually put out

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.642
a successful company, a successful exit.

00:15:05.666 --> 00:15:09.386
And recently, some of our colleagues
looked at exactly that question.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:12.566
And it turns out that yes,
those in the 20s and 30s

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.938
put out a huge number of companies,
form lots of companies,

00:15:15.962 --> 00:15:17.493
but most of them go bust.

00:15:18.089 --> 00:15:22.284
And when you look at the successful exits,
what you see in this particular plot,

00:15:22.308 --> 00:15:26.003
the older you are, the more likely that
you will actually hit the stock market

00:15:26.027 --> 00:15:28.339
or the sell the company successfully.

00:15:28.847 --> 00:15:31.960
This is so strong, actually,
that if you are in the 50s,

00:15:31.984 --> 00:15:35.572
you are twice as likely
to actually have a successful exit

00:15:35.596 --> 00:15:37.486
than if you are in your 30s.

00:15:38.613 --> 00:15:42.938
(Applause)

00:15:43.645 --> 00:15:46.654
So in the end, what is it
that we see, actually?

00:15:46.678 --> 00:15:50.761
What we see is that creativity has no age.

00:15:50.785 --> 00:15:52.987
Productivity does, right?

00:15:53.424 --> 00:15:57.559
Which is telling me that
at the end of the day,

00:15:57.583 --> 00:15:59.583
if you keep trying --

00:15:59.607 --> 00:16:02.010
(Laughter)

00:16:02.034 --> 00:16:05.606
you could still succeed
and succeed over and over.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.021
So my conclusion is very simple:

00:16:08.045 --> 00:16:10.138
I am off the stage, back in my lab.

00:16:10.162 --> 00:16:11.333
Thank you.

00:16:11.357 --> 00:16:14.666
(Applause)
