00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.239
Do you remember a time
when you felt hormonal and moody?

00:00:17.263 --> 00:00:19.247
Your skin was breaking out,

00:00:19.271 --> 00:00:23.373
your body was growing
in strange places and very fast,

00:00:24.235 --> 00:00:25.392
and at the same time,

00:00:25.416 --> 00:00:28.375
people were expecting you to be
grown-up in this new way.

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:30.407
Teenagers, right?

00:00:31.344 --> 00:00:36.155
Well, these same changes happen
to a woman when she's having a baby.

00:00:36.179 --> 00:00:40.533
And we know that it's normal
for teenagers to feel all over the place,

00:00:40.557 --> 00:00:43.912
so why don't we talk about
pregnancy in the same way?

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.503
There are entire textbooks written about
the developmental arc of adolescence,

00:00:50.527 --> 00:00:54.738
and we don't even have a word
to describe the transition to motherhood.

00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:56.436
We need one.

00:00:57.272 --> 00:01:00.502
I'm a psychiatrist who works
with pregnant and postpartum women,

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:02.182
a reproductive psychiatrist,

00:01:02.206 --> 00:01:05.124
and in the decade that I've been
working in this field,

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:06.868
I've noticed a pattern.

00:01:06.892 --> 00:01:08.848
It goes something like this:

00:01:08.872 --> 00:01:10.330
a woman calls me up,

00:01:10.354 --> 00:01:12.035
she's just had a baby,

00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:13.497
and she's concerned.

00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:17.956
She says, "I'm not good at this.
I'm not enjoying this.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.186
Do I have postpartum depression?"

00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:22.980
So I go through the symptoms
of that diagnosis,

00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:25.993
and it's clear to me
that she's not clinically depressed,

00:01:26.017 --> 00:01:27.497
and I tell her that.

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:29.414
But she isn't reassured.

00:01:29.438 --> 00:01:32.593
"It isn't supposed to feel
like this," she insists.

00:01:32.617 --> 00:01:35.909
So I say, "OK. What did you
expect it to feel like?"

00:01:36.495 --> 00:01:41.152
She says, "I thought motherhood
would make feel whole and happy.

00:01:41.708 --> 00:01:45.135
I thought my instincts
would naturally tell me what to do.

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:48.534
I thought I'd always want
to put the baby first."

00:01:49.463 --> 00:01:53.584
This -- this is an unrealistic expectation

00:01:53.608 --> 00:01:56.119
of what the transition
to motherhood feels like.

00:01:56.636 --> 00:01:58.684
And it wasn't just her.

00:01:58.708 --> 00:02:03.663
I was getting calls with questions
like this from hundreds of women,

00:02:03.687 --> 00:02:06.337
all concerned that something was wrong,

00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:08.393
because they couldn't measure up.

00:02:08.956 --> 00:02:11.291
And I didn't know how to help them,

00:02:11.315 --> 00:02:13.925
because telling them
that they weren't sick

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:15.785
wasn't making them feel better.

00:02:16.841 --> 00:02:21.122
I wanted to find a way
to normalize this transition,

00:02:21.145 --> 00:02:26.548
to explain that discomfort is not always
the same thing as disease.

00:02:26.572 --> 00:02:30.630
So I set out to learn more about
the psychology of motherhood.

00:02:30.654 --> 00:02:33.528
But there actually wasn't much
in the medical textbooks,

00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:36.169
because doctors mostly
write about disease.

00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:38.557
So I turned to anthropology.

00:02:39.148 --> 00:02:42.594
And it took me two years,
but in an out-of-print essay

00:02:42.618 --> 00:02:46.588
written in 1973 by Dana Raphael,

00:02:46.612 --> 00:02:51.115
I finally found a helpful way
to frame this conversation:

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.581
matrescence.

00:02:53.672 --> 00:02:58.484
It's not a coincidence that "matrescence"
sounds like "adolescence."

00:02:59.174 --> 00:03:02.866
Both are times when body morphing
and hormone shifting

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.594
lead to an upheaval
in how a person feels emotionally

00:03:06.618 --> 00:03:08.867
and how they fit into the world.

00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:13.050
And like adolescence,
matrescence is not a disease,

00:03:13.074 --> 00:03:15.896
but since it's not
in the medical vocabulary,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.607
since doctors aren't
educating people about it,

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:21.420
it's being confused
with a more serious condition

00:03:21.444 --> 00:03:23.210
called postpartum depression.

00:03:24.444 --> 00:03:26.932
I've been building on
the anthropology literature

00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:30.096
and have been talking
about matrescence with my patients

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.710
using a concept called
the "push and pull."

00:03:33.073 --> 00:03:34.497
Here's the pull part.

00:03:35.067 --> 00:03:39.388
As humans, our babies
are uniquely dependent.

00:03:39.412 --> 00:03:42.355
Unlike other animals,
our babies can't walk,

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:43.966
they can't feed themselves,

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.873
they're very hard to take care of.

00:03:45.897 --> 00:03:50.770
So evolution has helped us out
with this hormone called oxytocin.

00:03:50.794 --> 00:03:53.095
It's released around childbirth

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:55.595
and also during skin-to-skin touch,

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:58.890
so it rises even if you didn't
give birth to the baby.

00:03:59.668 --> 00:04:05.137
Oxytocin helps a human mother's brain
zoom in, pulling her attention in,

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:07.997
so that the baby is now
at the center of her world.

00:04:08.567 --> 00:04:13.949
But at the same time,
her mind is pushing away,

00:04:13.973 --> 00:04:18.609
because she remembers there are
all these other parts to her identity --

00:04:19.434 --> 00:04:20.989
other relationships,

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.835
her work,

00:04:22.859 --> 00:04:24.111
hobbies,

00:04:24.135 --> 00:04:26.662
a spiritual and intellectual life,

00:04:26.686 --> 00:04:28.954
not to mention physical needs:

00:04:28.978 --> 00:04:32.341
to sleep, to eat, to exercise,

00:04:32.366 --> 00:04:33.837
to have sex,

00:04:33.861 --> 00:04:35.275
to go to the bathroom,

00:04:35.299 --> 00:04:36.467
alone --

00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:37.660
(Laughter)

00:04:37.684 --> 00:04:38.854
if possible.

00:04:39.727 --> 00:04:43.761
This is the emotional
tug-of-war of matrescence.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.565
This is the tension
the women calling me were feeling.

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:49.869
It's why they thought they were sick.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.961
If women understood the natural
progression of matrescence,

00:04:55.985 --> 00:05:01.628
if they knew that most people found it
hard to live inside this push and pull,

00:05:01.652 --> 00:05:04.577
if they knew that under
these circumstances,

00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:09.151
ambivalence was normal
and nothing to be ashamed of,

00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:11.205
they would feel less alone,

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.532
they would feel less stigmatized,

00:05:13.556 --> 00:05:17.681
and I think it would even reduce
rates of postpartum depression.

00:05:18.332 --> 00:05:20.276
I'd love to study that one day.

00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:23.299
I'm a believer in talk therapy,

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:26.152
so if we're going to change the way
our culture understands

00:05:26.176 --> 00:05:27.970
this transition to motherhood,

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.158
women need to be talking to each other,

00:05:30.182 --> 00:05:31.504
not just me.

00:05:32.313 --> 00:05:35.942
So mothers, talk about your matrescence

00:05:35.966 --> 00:05:38.613
with other mothers, with your friends,

00:05:38.637 --> 00:05:40.866
and, if you have one, with your partner,

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.777
so that they can understand
their own transition

00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:45.426
and better support you.

00:05:45.891 --> 00:05:48.942
But it's not just about
protecting your relationship.

00:05:49.534 --> 00:05:52.979
When you preserve
a separate part of your identity,

00:05:53.003 --> 00:05:56.920
you're also leaving room
for your child to develop their own.

00:05:58.295 --> 00:06:02.145
When a baby is born, so is a mother,

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.978
each unsteady in their own way.

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:07.896
Matrescence is profound,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.688
but it's also hard,

00:06:09.712 --> 00:06:11.563
and that's what makes it human.

00:06:12.012 --> 00:06:13.167
Thank you.

00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:14.960
(Applause)
