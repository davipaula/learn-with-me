00:00:08.857 --> 00:00:10.825
There is an environmental mystery afoot,

00:00:10.825 --> 00:00:13.285
and it begins
with a seemingly trivial detail

00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:18.146
that reveals a disaster
of global proportions.

00:00:18.146 --> 00:00:20.761
One day, you notice that the honey
you slather on your morning toast

00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:22.177
is more expensive.

00:00:22.177 --> 00:00:24.063
Instead of switching to jam,

00:00:24.063 --> 00:00:26.823
you investigate the reason
for the price hike.

00:00:26.823 --> 00:00:28.555
What you find is shocking.

00:00:28.555 --> 00:00:30.951
The number of domesticated
honeybees in the US

00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:34.799
has been decreasing at an alarming rate.

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:36.666
This decline appears too big

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.824
to be explained by the usual causes
of bee death alone:

00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:42.961
disease, parasites or starvation.

00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:46.347
A typical crime scene
has almost no adult bees left in the hive,

00:00:46.347 --> 00:00:50.085
except, perhaps, a lonely queen
and a few other survivors.

00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:54.013
It's full of untouched food stores
and a brood of unborn larvae,

00:00:54.013 --> 00:00:58.759
suggesting that the adults vacated
without waiting for them to hatch.

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:00.685
But what's particularly eerie

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:04.569
is that there's no tell-tale mass
of dead or dying bees nearby.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.202
Either they have forgotten
their way back to the hive,

00:01:07.202 --> 00:01:10.534
or they have simply disappeared.

00:01:10.534 --> 00:01:13.075
These mysterious
disappearances aren't new.

00:01:13.075 --> 00:01:15.786
Humans have been collecting
honey for centuries.

00:01:15.786 --> 00:01:18.853
But it wasn't until European settlers
in the 1600's

00:01:18.853 --> 00:01:21.440
introduced the subspecies, 
Apis mellifera,

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.809
that we domesticated bees.

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:25.160
Since the 19th century,

00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:28.335
beekeepers have reported
occasional mass disappearances,

00:01:28.335 --> 00:01:29.985
giving them enigmatic names

00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:33.493
like disappearing disease,
spring dwindle disease

00:01:33.493 --> 00:01:35.515
and autumn collapse.

00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:38.149
But when in 2006 such losses 
were found to affect

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.443
more than half of all hives in the US,

00:01:40.443 --> 00:01:42.524
the phenomenon got a new name:

00:01:42.524 --> 00:01:45.441
colony collapse disorder.

00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:47.489
The most frightening thing 
about this mystery

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:50.994
isn't that we'll have to go back 
to using regular sugar in our tea.

00:01:50.994 --> 00:01:52.857
We farm bees for their honey,

00:01:52.857 --> 00:01:56.118
but they also pollinate our crops 
on an industrial scale,

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.962
generating over 1/3 of America's 
food production this way.

00:02:00.962 --> 00:02:03.940
So, how can we find 
the culprit behind this calamity?

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.690
Here are three of the possible offenders.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.783
Exhibit A: Pests and Disease.

00:02:10.783 --> 00:02:12.710
Most infamous is the varroa mite,

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.663
a minuscule red pest that not only 
invades colonies and feeds on bees,

00:02:16.663 --> 00:02:19.877
but also transfers pathogens 
that stunt bee growth

00:02:19.877 --> 00:02:21.917
and shortens their life span.

00:02:21.917 --> 00:02:24.672
Exhibit B: Genetics.

00:02:24.672 --> 00:02:26.924
The queen is the core of a healthy hive.

00:02:26.924 --> 00:02:29.794
But nowadays, the millions 
of queen bees distributed

00:02:29.794 --> 00:02:33.795
in commercial hives are bred 
from just a few original queens,

00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:36.378
which raises the worry about 
a lack of genetic diversity

00:02:36.378 --> 00:02:40.545
which could weaken bees' defenses 
against pathogens and pests.

00:02:40.545 --> 00:02:43.398
Exhibit C: Chemicals.

00:02:43.398 --> 00:02:45.937
Pesticides used both
on commercial beehives

00:02:45.937 --> 00:02:48.326
and agricultural crops 
to ward off parasites

00:02:48.326 --> 00:02:51.796
could be getting into the food 
and water that honeybees consume.

00:02:51.796 --> 00:02:54.129
Researchers have even found
that some pesticides

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.295
damage the honeybees' homing abilities.

00:02:58.295 --> 00:03:00.209
So we have a file full of clues

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.751
but no clear leads.

00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:04.836
In reality, scientists, 
the actual detectives on this case,

00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:08.710
face disagreement over what causes 
colony collapse disorder.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.213
For now, we assume that 
several factors are the cause.

00:03:13.213 --> 00:03:16.140
Honeybees aren't necessarily 
in danger of extinction,

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.102
but fewer bees overall means
less pollination and higher food costs,

00:03:20.102 --> 00:03:24.355
so it's crucial that scientists solve 
the case of the vanishing bees.

00:03:24.355 --> 00:03:26.898
Because while having less honey 
might be a buzzkill,

00:03:26.898 --> 00:03:30.319
crop shortages are something
that would truly sting.
