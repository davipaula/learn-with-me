00:00:00.062 --> 00:00:04.649
We survey CEOs, police officers,
truck drivers, cooks, engineers.

00:00:04.673 --> 00:00:06.698
If people are working,
we've surveyed them.

00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:08.895
And what we know,
in terms of their happiness:

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:10.750
workers all want the same things.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.176
[The Way We Work]

00:00:15.427 --> 00:00:17.792
There's three billion
working people in the world.

00:00:17.816 --> 00:00:20.705
And about 40 percent of them would say
they're happy at work.

00:00:20.729 --> 00:00:24.559
That means about 1.8 billion,
or almost two billion people,

00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:25.957
are not happy at work.

00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:27.184
What does that do,

00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:30.433
both to those people
and the organizations that they work in?

00:00:30.457 --> 00:00:31.885
Well, let's talk about money.

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:34.745
Organizations that have
a lot of happy employees

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:36.499
have three times the revenue growth,

00:00:36.523 --> 00:00:38.792
compared to organizations
where that's not true.

00:00:38.816 --> 00:00:41.530
They outperform the stock market
by a factor of three.

00:00:41.554 --> 00:00:43.435
And if you look at employee turnover,

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:47.983
it's half that of organizations
that have a lot of unhappy employees.

00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:49.183
The miracle thing is,

00:00:49.207 --> 00:00:51.786
you don't have to spend
more money to make this happen.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.816
It's not about ping-pong tables
and massages and pet walking.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.078
It's not about the perks.

00:00:56.102 --> 00:00:58.554
It's all about how
they're treated by their leaders

00:00:58.578 --> 00:01:00.434
and by the people that they work with.

00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:04.450
So I'd like to share a few ideas
that create happy employees.

00:01:04.474 --> 00:01:06.094
Idea number one:

00:01:06.118 --> 00:01:08.761
in organizations
where employees are happy,

00:01:08.785 --> 00:01:10.868
what you find is two things are present:

00:01:10.892 --> 00:01:12.075
trust and respect.

00:01:12.432 --> 00:01:13.623
Leaders often say,

00:01:13.647 --> 00:01:15.019
"We trust our employees.

00:01:15.043 --> 00:01:16.535
We empower our employees."

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:18.588
And then when an employee
needs a laptop --

00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:20.034
and this is a true example --

00:01:20.058 --> 00:01:22.784
15 people have to approve that laptop.

00:01:22.808 --> 00:01:25.102
So for the employee,
all the words are right,

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:28.963
but 15 levels of approval
for a $1,500 laptop?

00:01:28.987 --> 00:01:32.218
You've actually spent more money
than the laptop, on the approval.

00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:35.963
And the employee feels
maybe they're really not trusted.

00:01:35.987 --> 00:01:40.398
So what can an organization do
to have a high level of trust?

00:01:40.422 --> 00:01:43.348
The first organization
that comes to mind is Four Seasons.

00:01:43.372 --> 00:01:46.046
They have magnificent properties
all around the world.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.595
And their employees are told,

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:50.697
"Do whatever you think is right
when servicing the customer."

00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:55.078
To hand that trust to your employees
to do whatever they think is right

00:01:55.102 --> 00:01:56.934
makes the employees feel great.

00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.217
And this is why they're known
for delivering some of the best service

00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:01.392
in the world.

00:02:01.416 --> 00:02:03.956
Idea number two: fairness.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.185
The thing that erodes trust
in an organization

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:08.723
faster than anything else

00:02:08.747 --> 00:02:11.859
is when employees feel
that they're being treated unfairly.

00:02:11.883 --> 00:02:13.737
Employees want to be treated the same,

00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:16.599
regardless of their rank
or their tenure or their age

00:02:16.623 --> 00:02:18.913
or their experience or their job category,

00:02:18.937 --> 00:02:20.388
compared to anyone else.

00:02:20.412 --> 00:02:23.477
When I think about great organizations
who get fairness right,

00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:26.126
the first organization
that comes to mind is Salesforce.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.911
They found that men and women
working in the same job

00:02:28.935 --> 00:02:30.665
with the same level of proficiency

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.554
were making different amounts of money.

00:02:32.578 --> 00:02:34.935
So immediately, they
calculated the difference,

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.506
and they invested three million dollars
to try and balance things out.

00:02:39.065 --> 00:02:41.246
Idea number three is listening.

00:02:41.617 --> 00:02:45.308
So, to be a listener who connects
with all types of people,

00:02:45.332 --> 00:02:47.419
we have to unlearn a few things.

00:02:47.443 --> 00:02:51.411
We've all been taught about
active listening and eye contact --

00:02:51.435 --> 00:02:53.165
an intense stare

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.911
and a compassionate look.

00:02:54.935 --> 00:02:56.114
That's not listening.

00:02:56.138 --> 00:02:59.200
Repeating what the person says --
that's not listening.

00:02:59.224 --> 00:03:00.433
Being humble

00:03:00.457 --> 00:03:03.755
and always hunting and searching
for the best idea possible --

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:05.215
that's what listening is.

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.875
And employees can feel
whether you're doing that or not.

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:11.086
They want to know, when they talk to you
and share an idea,

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.384
did you consider it
when you made a decision?

00:03:13.408 --> 00:03:17.673
The one thing that everybody appreciates
and wants when they're speaking

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:21.411
is to know that what they say
matters so much

00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:23.514
you might actually change your mind.

00:03:23.538 --> 00:03:26.050
Otherwise, what's the point
of the conversation?

00:03:27.533 --> 00:03:29.922
We all know the things we need to change,

00:03:29.946 --> 00:03:31.979
the things that we need to do differently.

00:03:32.003 --> 00:03:34.629
The way you behave,
the way you treat others,

00:03:34.653 --> 00:03:37.935
the way you respond, the way you support,

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.705
defines the work experience
for everyone around you.

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:42.769
Changing to be a better person --

00:03:42.793 --> 00:03:44.816
the world is littered with those failures.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.746
But changing because
there's something you believe in,

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.753
some purpose that you have,

00:03:49.777 --> 00:03:52.338
where you're willing to risk
almost everything

00:03:52.362 --> 00:03:54.261
because it's so important to you --

00:03:54.285 --> 00:03:55.959
that's the reason to change.

00:03:55.983 --> 00:03:58.381
If it's not, you should probably
find a different place to work.
