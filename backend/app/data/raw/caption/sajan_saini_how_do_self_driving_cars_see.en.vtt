00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:15.132
It’s late, pitch dark, and a self-driving 
car winds down a narrow country road.

00:00:15.132 --> 00:00:18.724
Suddenly, three hazards appear 
at the same time.

00:00:18.724 --> 00:00:20.846
What happens next?

00:00:20.846 --> 00:00:24.043
Before it can navigate this 
onslaught of obstacles,

00:00:24.043 --> 00:00:26.083
the car has to detect them—

00:00:26.083 --> 00:00:29.846
gleaning enough information about 
their size, shape, and position,

00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:34.208
so that its control algorithms 
can plot the safest course.

00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:35.762
With no human at the wheel,

00:00:35.762 --> 00:00:40.547
the car needs smart eyes, sensors 
that’ll resolve these details—

00:00:40.547 --> 00:00:43.898
no matter the environment, 
weather, or how dark it is—

00:00:43.898 --> 00:00:45.920
all in a split-second.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.159
That’s a tall order, but there’s a 
solution that partners two things:

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:53.849
a special kind of laser-based probe 
called LIDAR,

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:56.578
and a miniature version of 
the communications technology

00:00:56.578 --> 00:01:00.936
that keeps the internet humming,
called integrated photonics.

00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:06.006
To understand LIDAR, it helps to start 
with a related technology— radar.

00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:07.165
In aviation,

00:01:07.165 --> 00:01:11.866
radar antennas launch pulses 
of radio or microwaves at planes

00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:16.620
to learn their locations by timing 
how long the beams take to bounce back.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.593
That’s a limited way of seeing, though,

00:01:18.593 --> 00:01:22.679
because the large beam-size 
can’t visualize fine details.

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.127
In contrast, a self-driving car’s 
LIDAR system,

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:28.634
which stands for Light Detection 
and Ranging,

00:01:28.634 --> 00:01:32.190
uses a narrow invisible infrared laser.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.660
It can image features as small as the 
button on a pedestrian’s shirt

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.123
across the street.

00:01:38.123 --> 00:01:42.483
But how do we determine the shape, 
or depth, of these features?

00:01:42.483 --> 00:01:48.267
LIDAR fires a train of super-short laser 
pulses to give depth resolution.

00:01:48.267 --> 00:01:50.746
Take the moose on the country road.

00:01:50.746 --> 00:01:55.853
As the car drives by, one LIDAR pulse 
scatters off the base of its antlers,

00:01:55.853 --> 00:02:00.721
while the next may travel to the tip 
of one antler before bouncing back.

00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:04.278
Measuring how much longer 
the second pulse takes to return

00:02:04.278 --> 00:02:06.882
provides data about the antler’s shape.

00:02:06.882 --> 00:02:13.192
With a lot of short pulses, a LIDAR system
quickly renders a detailed profile.

00:02:13.192 --> 00:02:18.557
The most obvious way to create a pulse 
of light is to switch a laser on and off.

00:02:18.557 --> 00:02:23.428
But this makes a laser unstable and 
affects the precise timing of its pulses,

00:02:23.428 --> 00:02:25.669
which limits depth resolution.

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:27.044
Better to leave it on,

00:02:27.044 --> 00:02:33.031
and use something else to periodically 
block the light reliably and rapidly.

00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:35.987
That’s where integrated photonics come in.

00:02:35.987 --> 00:02:37.829
The digital data of the internet

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.051
is carried by precision-timed 
pulses of light,

00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:44.473
some as short as a hundred picoseconds.

00:02:44.473 --> 00:02:49.104
One way to create these pulses is 
with a Mach-Zehnder modulator.

00:02:49.104 --> 00:02:52.865
This device takes advantage of a 
particular wave property,

00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:54.658
called interference.

00:02:54.658 --> 00:02:57.613
Imagine dropping pebbles into a pond:

00:02:57.613 --> 00:03:01.550
as the ripples spread and overlap, 
a pattern forms.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.464
In some places, wave peaks add 
up to become very large;

00:03:05.464 --> 00:03:08.450
in other places, they completely 
cancel out.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.517
The Mach-Zehnder modulator 
does something similar.

00:03:11.517 --> 00:03:17.292
It splits waves of light along two 
parallel arms and eventually rejoins them.

00:03:17.292 --> 00:03:20.784
If the light is slowed down and 
delayed in one arm,

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:25.703
the waves recombine out of sync and 
cancel, blocking the light.

00:03:25.703 --> 00:03:28.335
By toggling this delay in one arm,

00:03:28.335 --> 00:03:33.606
the modulator acts like an on/off switch, 
emitting pulses of light.

00:03:33.606 --> 00:03:36.380
A light pulse lasting a hundred 
picoseconds

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.790
leads to a depth resolution of a 
few centimeters,

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.303
but tomorrow’s cars will need 
to see better than that.

00:03:43.303 --> 00:03:47.595
By pairing the modulator with a super-
sensitive, fast-acting light detector,

00:03:47.595 --> 00:03:50.878
the resolution can be refined 
to a millimeter.

00:03:50.878 --> 00:03:52.781
That’s more than a hundred times better 

00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:57.337
than what we can make out with 
20/20 vision, from across a street.

00:03:57.337 --> 00:04:02.925
The first generation of automobile LIDAR 
has relied on complex spinning assemblies

00:04:02.925 --> 00:04:05.777
that scan from rooftops or hoods.

00:04:05.777 --> 00:04:07.494
With integrated photonics,

00:04:07.494 --> 00:04:12.508
modulators and detectors are being shrunk 
to less than a tenth of a millimeter,

00:04:12.508 --> 00:04:17.837
and packed into tiny chips that’ll one 
day fit inside a car’s lights.

00:04:17.837 --> 00:04:21.806
These chips will also include a clever 
variation on the modulator

00:04:21.806 --> 00:04:27.275
to help do away with moving parts 
and scan at rapid speeds.

00:04:27.275 --> 00:04:31.097
By slowing the light in a modulator 
arm only a tiny bit,

00:04:31.097 --> 00:04:36.208
this additional device will act more 
like a dimmer than an on/off switch.

00:04:36.208 --> 00:04:40.708
If an array of many such arms, each with 
a tiny controlled delay,

00:04:40.708 --> 00:04:44.786
is stacked in parallel, something novel 
can be designed:

00:04:44.786 --> 00:04:47.492
a steerable laser beam.

00:04:47.492 --> 00:04:48.848
From their new vantage,

00:04:48.848 --> 00:04:52.248
these smart eyes will probe and 
see more thoroughly

00:04:52.248 --> 00:04:54.681
than anything nature could’ve imagined—

00:04:54.681 --> 00:04:57.544
and help navigate any number 
of obstacles.

00:04:57.544 --> 00:05:00.098
All without anyone breaking a sweat—

00:05:00.098 --> 00:05:03.988
except for maybe one disoriented moose.
