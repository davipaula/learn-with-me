00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:17.542
In 1987, a Chilean engineer
named Oscar Duhalde

00:00:17.566 --> 00:00:20.869
became the only
living person on the planet

00:00:20.893 --> 00:00:23.612
to discover a rare astronomical event

00:00:23.636 --> 00:00:24.972
with the naked eye.

00:00:25.684 --> 00:00:30.362
Oscar was a telescope operator
at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.

00:00:30.386 --> 00:00:34.444
He worked with the astronomers who came
to the observatory for their research,

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:38.059
running the telescopes and processing
the data that they took.

00:00:38.573 --> 00:00:40.753
On the night of February 24th,

00:00:40.777 --> 00:00:42.793
Oscar stepped outside for a break

00:00:42.817 --> 00:00:45.720
and looked up at the night sky
and he saw this.

00:00:46.103 --> 00:00:48.468
This is the Large Magellanic Cloud.

00:00:48.492 --> 00:00:52.199
It's a satellite galaxy very near
our own Milky Way.

00:00:52.223 --> 00:00:53.565
But on that February night,

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.521
Oscar noticed that something
was different about this galaxy.

00:00:56.545 --> 00:00:58.109
It didn't quite look like this.

00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.365
It looked like this.

00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:02.641
Did you see it?

00:01:02.665 --> 00:01:03.698
(Laughter)

00:01:03.722 --> 00:01:08.863
A small point of light had appeared
in one corner of this galaxy.

00:01:09.327 --> 00:01:12.091
So to explain how amazing it is
that Oscar noticed this,

00:01:12.115 --> 00:01:13.757
we need to zoom out a bit

00:01:13.781 --> 00:01:17.388
and look at what the southern
sky in Chile looks like.

00:01:17.412 --> 00:01:21.019
The Large Magellanic Cloud
is right in the middle of that image,

00:01:21.043 --> 00:01:24.049
but despite its name, it's really small.

00:01:24.073 --> 00:01:27.946
Imagine trying to notice
one single new point of light

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.732
appearing in that galaxy.

00:01:30.486 --> 00:01:32.210
Oscar was able to do this

00:01:32.234 --> 00:01:36.311
because he had the Large Magellanic Cloud
essentially memorized.

00:01:36.335 --> 00:01:39.547
He had worked on data
from this galaxy for years,

00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:42.169
poring over night after night
of observations

00:01:42.193 --> 00:01:44.093
and doing it by hand,

00:01:44.117 --> 00:01:47.011
because Oscar had begun
his work in astronomy

00:01:47.035 --> 00:01:51.323
at a time when we stored all of the data
that we observed from the universe

00:01:51.347 --> 00:01:53.736
on fragile sheets of glass.

00:01:54.593 --> 00:01:56.635
I know that today's theme is "Moonshot,"

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.360
and as an astronomer, I figured
I could start us out nice and literally,

00:02:00.384 --> 00:02:02.320
so here's a shot of the Moon.

00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:03.349
(Laughter)

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:06.886
It's a familiar sight to all of us,
but there's a couple of unusual things

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.462
about this particular image.

00:02:08.486 --> 00:02:10.472
For one, I flipped the colors.

00:02:10.496 --> 00:02:12.499
It originally looked like this.

00:02:12.523 --> 00:02:16.013
And if we zoom out, we can see
how this picture was taken.

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:20.037
This is a photograph
of the Moon taken in 1894

00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:22.774
on a glass photographic plate.

00:02:22.798 --> 00:02:26.655
This was the technology that astronomers
had available for decades

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:30.283
to store the observations
that we took of the night sky.

00:02:30.756 --> 00:02:34.723
I've actually brought an example
of a glass plate to show you.

00:02:34.747 --> 00:02:37.799
So this looks like a real secure way
to store our data.

00:02:38.728 --> 00:02:41.867
These photographic plates
were incredibly difficult to work with.

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:46.442
One side of them was treated
with a chemical emulsion that would darken

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.299
when it was exposed to light.

00:02:48.323 --> 00:02:51.952
This is how these plates were able
to store the pictures that they took,

00:02:51.976 --> 00:02:56.505
but it meant that astronomers
had to work with these plates in darkness.

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.239
The plates had to be cut
to a specific size

00:02:59.263 --> 00:03:01.968
so that they could fit
into the camera of a telescope.

00:03:01.992 --> 00:03:04.783
So astronomers would take
razor-sharp cutting tools

00:03:04.807 --> 00:03:08.446
and slice these tiny pieces of glass,

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.083
all in the dark.

00:03:10.107 --> 00:03:12.944
Astronomers also had all kinds of tricks
that they would use

00:03:12.968 --> 00:03:15.626
to make the plates
respond to light a little faster.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.967
They would bake them or freeze them,
they would soak them in ammonia,

00:03:18.991 --> 00:03:20.895
or they'd coat them with lemon juice --

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:22.331
all in the dark.

00:03:22.355 --> 00:03:25.137
Then astronomers would take
these carefully designed plates

00:03:25.161 --> 00:03:26.322
to the telescope

00:03:26.346 --> 00:03:28.289
and load them into the camera.

00:03:28.313 --> 00:03:32.044
They had to be loaded with that
chemically emulsified side pointed out

00:03:32.068 --> 00:03:33.577
so that the light would hit it.

00:03:33.601 --> 00:03:38.128
But in the dark, it was almost impossible
to tell which side was the right one.

00:03:38.152 --> 00:03:41.642
Astronomers got into the habit
of tapping a plate to their lips,

00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:45.927
or, like, licking it, to see
which side of the plate was sticky

00:03:45.951 --> 00:03:48.098
and therefore coated with the emulsion.

00:03:48.122 --> 00:03:50.661
And then when they actually
put it into the camera,

00:03:50.685 --> 00:03:52.794
there was one last challenge.

00:03:52.818 --> 00:03:54.301
In this picture behind me,

00:03:54.325 --> 00:03:56.823
you can see that the plate
the astronomer is holding

00:03:56.847 --> 00:03:58.456
is very slightly curved.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.940
Sometimes plates had to be bent
to fit into a telescope's camera,

00:04:02.964 --> 00:04:07.976
so you would take this carefully cut,
meticulously treated, very babied plate

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.533
up to a telescope, and then you'd just ...

00:04:11.057 --> 00:04:14.417
So sometimes that would work.
Sometimes they would snap.

00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:17.821
But it would usually end
with the [plate] loaded into a camera

00:04:17.845 --> 00:04:19.392
on the back of a telescope.

00:04:19.416 --> 00:04:21.132
You could then point that telescope

00:04:21.156 --> 00:04:23.372
to whatever patch of sky
you wanted to study,

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:24.658
open the camera shutter,

00:04:24.682 --> 00:04:26.585
and begin capturing data.

00:04:27.302 --> 00:04:29.973
Now, astronomers couldn't just
walk away from the camera

00:04:29.997 --> 00:04:31.155
once they'd done this.

00:04:31.179 --> 00:04:34.542
They had to stay with that camera
for as long as they were observing.

00:04:34.972 --> 00:04:37.758
This meant that astronomers
would get into elevators

00:04:37.782 --> 00:04:40.802
attached to the side
of the telescope domes.

00:04:40.826 --> 00:04:43.399
They would ride the elevator
high into the building

00:04:43.423 --> 00:04:45.848
and then climb into
the top of the telescope

00:04:45.872 --> 00:04:49.578
and stay there all night
shivering in the cold,

00:04:49.602 --> 00:04:51.731
transferring plates
in and out of the camera,

00:04:51.755 --> 00:04:53.407
opening and closing the shutter

00:04:53.431 --> 00:04:55.885
and pointing the telescope
to whatever piece of sky

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:57.526
they wanted to study.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.835
These astronomers worked with operators
who would stay on the ground.

00:05:00.859 --> 00:05:03.374
And they would do things
like turn the dome itself

00:05:03.398 --> 00:05:06.057
and make sure the rest
of the telescope was running.

00:05:06.081 --> 00:05:08.352
It was a system that usually
worked pretty well,

00:05:08.376 --> 00:05:10.689
but once in a while,
things would go wrong.

00:05:10.713 --> 00:05:14.276
There was an astronomer observing
a very complicated plate

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.590
at this observatory,
the Lick Observatory here in California.

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:20.453
He was sitting at the top
of that yellow structure

00:05:20.477 --> 00:05:22.937
that you see in the dome
on the lower right,

00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:27.390
and he'd been exposing
one glass plate to the sky for hours,

00:05:27.414 --> 00:05:29.233
crouched down and cold

00:05:29.257 --> 00:05:31.626
and keeping the telescope
perfectly pointed

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.531
so he could take this precious
picture of the universe.

00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:37.231
His operator wandered
into the dome at one point

00:05:37.255 --> 00:05:39.729
just to check on him
and see how things were going.

00:05:39.753 --> 00:05:42.991
And as the operator stepped through
the door of the dome,

00:05:43.015 --> 00:05:49.383
he brushed against the wall
and flipped the light switch in the dome.

00:05:49.407 --> 00:05:52.413
So the lights came blazing on
and flooding into the telescope

00:05:52.437 --> 00:05:53.849
and ruining the plate,

00:05:53.873 --> 00:05:57.055
and there was then this howl
from the top of the telescope.

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:59.767
The astronomer started yelling
and cursing and saying,

00:05:59.791 --> 00:06:02.489
"What have you done?
You've destroyed so much hard work.

00:06:02.513 --> 00:06:05.174
I'm going to get down
from this telescope and kill you!"

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:07.693
So he then starts moving the telescope

00:06:07.717 --> 00:06:08.868
about this fast --

00:06:08.892 --> 00:06:09.898
(Laughter)

00:06:09.922 --> 00:06:11.185
toward the elevator

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:13.870
so that he can climb down
and make good on his threats.

00:06:13.894 --> 00:06:15.751
Now, as he's approaching the elevator,

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:18.449
the elevator then suddenly
starts spinning away from him,

00:06:18.473 --> 00:06:21.251
because remember, the astronomer
can control the telescope,

00:06:21.275 --> 00:06:23.100
but the operator can control the dome.

00:06:23.124 --> 00:06:24.131
(Laughter)

00:06:24.155 --> 00:06:26.022
And the operator is looking up, going,

00:06:26.046 --> 00:06:30.258
"He seems really mad. I might not want
to let him down until he's less murdery."

00:06:30.282 --> 00:06:33.217
So the end is this absurd
slow-motion game of chase

00:06:33.241 --> 00:06:36.308
with the lights on and the dome
just spinning around and around.

00:06:36.332 --> 00:06:38.500
It must have looked completely ridiculous.

00:06:38.968 --> 00:06:42.433
When I tell people about using
photographic plates to study the universe,

00:06:42.457 --> 00:06:44.106
it does sound ridiculous.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.437
It's a little absurd

00:06:45.461 --> 00:06:48.847
to take what seems like a primitive tool
for studying the universe

00:06:48.871 --> 00:06:51.901
and say, well, we're going
to dunk this in lemon juice, lick it,

00:06:51.925 --> 00:06:54.836
stick it in the telescope,
shiver next to it for a few hours

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.301
and solve the mysteries of the cosmos.

00:06:57.325 --> 00:06:59.666
In reality, though,
that's exactly what we did.

00:07:00.332 --> 00:07:01.948
I showed you this picture before

00:07:01.972 --> 00:07:04.680
of an astronomer perched
at the top of a telescope.

00:07:04.704 --> 00:07:07.858
What I didn't tell you
is who this astronomer is.

00:07:07.882 --> 00:07:10.337
This is Edwin Hubble,

00:07:10.361 --> 00:07:12.626
and Hubble used photographic plates

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.516
to completely change
our entire understanding

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.263
of how big the universe is
and how it works.

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:22.535
This is a plate
that Hubble took back in 1923

00:07:22.559 --> 00:07:25.909
of an object known at the time
as the Andromeda Nebula.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.376
You can see in the upper
right of that image

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.892
that Hubble has labeled a star
with this bright red word, "Var!"

00:07:31.916 --> 00:07:34.545
He's even put an exclamation
point next to it.

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:36.877
"Var" here stands for "variable."

00:07:36.901 --> 00:07:40.077
Hubble had found a variable star
in the Andromeda Nebula.

00:07:40.101 --> 00:07:41.684
Its brightness changed,

00:07:41.708 --> 00:07:44.275
getting brighter and dimmer
as a function of time.

00:07:44.299 --> 00:07:48.262
Hubble knew that if he studied
how that star changed with time,

00:07:48.286 --> 00:07:51.398
he could measure the distance
to the Andromeda Nebula,

00:07:51.422 --> 00:07:54.591
and when he did,
the results were astonishing.

00:07:54.615 --> 00:07:57.622
He discovered that this was not,
in fact, a nebula.

00:07:57.646 --> 00:07:59.688
This was the Andromeda Galaxy,

00:07:59.712 --> 00:08:02.894
an entire separate galaxy
two and a half million light years

00:08:02.918 --> 00:08:04.799
beyond our own Milky Way.

00:08:04.823 --> 00:08:07.196
This was the first evidence
of other galaxies

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.391
existing in the universe beyond our own,

00:08:09.415 --> 00:08:13.769
and it totally changed our understanding
of how big the universe was

00:08:13.793 --> 00:08:15.166
and what it contained.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.938
So now we can look at
what telescopes can do today.

00:08:18.962 --> 00:08:21.870
This is a modern-day picture
of the Andromeda Galaxy,

00:08:21.894 --> 00:08:23.933
and it looks just like
the telescope photos

00:08:23.957 --> 00:08:25.814
that we all love to enjoy and look at:

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:28.581
it's colorful and detailed and beautiful.

00:08:28.605 --> 00:08:31.221
We now store data like this digitally,

00:08:31.245 --> 00:08:34.566
and we take it using
telescopes like these.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.542
So this is me standing underneath
a telescope with a mirror

00:08:37.566 --> 00:08:40.049
that's 26 feet across.

00:08:40.445 --> 00:08:44.217
Bigger telescope mirrors let us take
sharper and clearer images,

00:08:44.241 --> 00:08:46.740
and they also make it
easier for us to gather light

00:08:46.764 --> 00:08:49.727
from faint and faraway objects.

00:08:49.751 --> 00:08:53.190
So a bigger telescope literally
gives us a farther reach

00:08:53.214 --> 00:08:54.388
into the universe,

00:08:54.412 --> 00:08:57.224
looking at things that we
couldn't have seen before.

00:08:57.749 --> 00:09:00.009
We're also no longer strapped
to the telescope

00:09:00.033 --> 00:09:01.781
when we do our observations.

00:09:01.805 --> 00:09:04.295
This is me during
my very first observing trip

00:09:04.319 --> 00:09:05.977
at a telescope in Arizona.

00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:08.198
I'm opening the dome of the telescope,

00:09:08.222 --> 00:09:10.634
but I'm not on top
of the telescope to do it.

00:09:10.658 --> 00:09:13.342
I'm sitting in a room
off to the side of the dome,

00:09:13.366 --> 00:09:15.660
nice and warm and on the ground

00:09:15.684 --> 00:09:17.652
and running the telescope from afar.

00:09:18.054 --> 00:09:19.668
"Afar" can get pretty extreme.

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:22.730
Sometimes we don't even need
to go to telescopes anymore.

00:09:23.316 --> 00:09:26.875
This is a telescope in New Mexico
that I use for my research all the time,

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:28.879
but I can run it with my laptop.

00:09:28.903 --> 00:09:31.046
I can sit on my couch in Seattle

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.034
and send commands from my laptop

00:09:33.058 --> 00:09:35.184
telling the telescope where to point,

00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:37.254
when to open and close the shutter,

00:09:37.278 --> 00:09:39.867
what pictures I want it
to take of the universe --

00:09:39.891 --> 00:09:42.279
all from many states away.

00:09:42.303 --> 00:09:45.708
So the way that we operate
telescopes has really changed,

00:09:45.732 --> 00:09:48.531
but the questions we're trying to answer
about the universe

00:09:48.555 --> 00:09:49.988
have remained the same.

00:09:50.726 --> 00:09:55.643
One of the big questions still focuses
on how things change in the night sky,

00:09:55.667 --> 00:09:59.222
and the changing sky was exactly
what Oscar Duhalde saw

00:09:59.246 --> 00:10:02.700
when he looked up
with the naked eye in 1987.

00:10:02.724 --> 00:10:07.858
This point of light that he saw appearing
in the Large Magellanic Cloud

00:10:07.882 --> 00:10:09.866
turned out to be a supernova.

00:10:10.416 --> 00:10:13.182
This was the first naked-eye supernova

00:10:13.206 --> 00:10:16.821
seen from Earth in more than 400 years.

00:10:17.408 --> 00:10:18.606
This is pretty cool,

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.530
but a couple of you might
be looking at this image and going,

00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:23.227
"Really? I've heard of supernovae.

00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:24.964
They're supposed to be spectacular,

00:10:24.988 --> 00:10:27.641
and this is just like a dot
that appeared in the sky."

00:10:27.665 --> 00:10:30.877
It's true that when you hear
the description of what a supernova is

00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:32.098
it sounds really epic.

00:10:32.122 --> 00:10:36.527
They're these brilliant, explosive deaths
of enormous, massive stars,

00:10:36.551 --> 00:10:38.645
and they shoot energy
out into the universe,

00:10:38.669 --> 00:10:40.576
and they spew material out into space,

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.953
and they sound, like, noticeable.

00:10:42.977 --> 00:10:44.438
They sound really obvious.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:47.177
The whole trick about
what a supernova looks like

00:10:47.201 --> 00:10:49.401
has to do with where it is.

00:10:49.425 --> 00:10:51.512
If a star were to die as a supernova

00:10:51.536 --> 00:10:55.361
right in our backyard in the Milky Way,
a few hundred light years away --

00:10:55.385 --> 00:10:57.387
"backyard" in astronomy terms --

00:10:57.411 --> 00:10:59.421
it would be incredibly bright.

00:10:59.445 --> 00:11:02.233
We would be able to see
that supernova at night

00:11:02.257 --> 00:11:03.745
as bright as the Moon.

00:11:03.769 --> 00:11:05.976
We would be able to read by its light.

00:11:06.395 --> 00:11:09.840
Everybody would wind up taking photos
of this supernova on their phone.

00:11:09.864 --> 00:11:12.032
It would be on headlines
all over the world.

00:11:12.056 --> 00:11:13.967
It would for sure get a hashtag.

00:11:13.991 --> 00:11:18.682
It would be impossible to miss
that a supernova had happened so nearby.

00:11:19.063 --> 00:11:21.293
But the supernova that Oscar observed

00:11:21.317 --> 00:11:24.023
didn't happen a few hundred
light years away.

00:11:24.547 --> 00:11:29.577
This supernova happened
170,000 light years away,

00:11:29.601 --> 00:11:32.349
which is why instead of an epic explosion,

00:11:32.373 --> 00:11:33.999
it appears as a little dot.

00:11:34.627 --> 00:11:36.711
This was still unbelievably exciting.

00:11:36.735 --> 00:11:38.999
It was still visible with the naked eye,

00:11:39.023 --> 00:11:40.893
and the most spectacular supernova

00:11:40.917 --> 00:11:43.606
that we've seen since
the invention of the telescope.

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:47.242
But it gives you a better sense
of what most supernovae look like.

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:51.048
We still discover and study
supernovae all the time today,

00:11:51.072 --> 00:11:54.912
but we do it in distant galaxies
using powerful telescopes.

00:11:54.936 --> 00:11:57.415
We photograph the galaxy multiple times,

00:11:57.439 --> 00:11:59.464
and we look for something that's changed.

00:11:59.488 --> 00:12:01.999
We look for that little
pinprick of light appearing

00:12:02.023 --> 00:12:04.188
that tells us that a star has died.

00:12:04.705 --> 00:12:07.620
We can learn a great deal
about the universe and about stars

00:12:07.644 --> 00:12:08.881
from supernovae,

00:12:08.905 --> 00:12:11.772
but we don't want to leave
studying them up to chance.

00:12:11.796 --> 00:12:15.467
We don't want to count on
happening to look up at the right time

00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:17.956
or pointing our telescope
at the right galaxy.

00:12:18.607 --> 00:12:20.797
What we ideally want is a telescope

00:12:20.821 --> 00:12:24.271
that can systematically
and computationally

00:12:24.295 --> 00:12:27.007
do what Oscar did with his mind.

00:12:27.598 --> 00:12:30.294
Oscar was able to discover this supernova

00:12:30.318 --> 00:12:33.293
because he had that galaxy memorized.

00:12:33.704 --> 00:12:35.079
With digital data,

00:12:35.103 --> 00:12:39.069
we can effectively memorize
every piece of the sky that we look at,

00:12:39.093 --> 00:12:41.336
compare old and new observations

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.980
and look for anything that's changed.

00:12:45.167 --> 00:12:47.745
This is the Vera Rubin Observatory

00:12:47.769 --> 00:12:49.023
in Chile.

00:12:49.047 --> 00:12:53.004
Now, when I visited it back in March,
it was still under construction.

00:12:53.028 --> 00:12:56.198
But this telescope
will begin observations next year,

00:12:56.222 --> 00:12:57.412
and when it does,

00:12:57.436 --> 00:13:02.174
it will carry out a simple
but spectacular observing program.

00:13:02.734 --> 00:13:06.500
This telescope will photograph
the entire southern sky

00:13:06.524 --> 00:13:08.064
every few days

00:13:08.088 --> 00:13:09.270
over and over,

00:13:09.294 --> 00:13:11.111
following a preset pattern

00:13:11.135 --> 00:13:13.017
for 10 years.

00:13:13.613 --> 00:13:16.905
Computers and algorithms
affiliated with the observatory

00:13:16.929 --> 00:13:21.594
will then compare every pair of images
taken of the same patch of sky,

00:13:21.618 --> 00:13:24.239
looking for anything
that's gotten brighter or dimmer,

00:13:24.263 --> 00:13:25.723
like a variable star,

00:13:25.747 --> 00:13:27.788
or looking for anything that's appeared,

00:13:27.812 --> 00:13:29.402
like a supernova.

00:13:29.426 --> 00:13:33.764
Right now, we discover about
a thousand supernovae every year.

00:13:33.788 --> 00:13:38.138
The Rubin Observatory will be capable
of discovering a thousand supernovae

00:13:38.162 --> 00:13:39.680
every night.

00:13:39.704 --> 00:13:43.084
It's going to dramatically change
the face of astronomy

00:13:43.108 --> 00:13:46.100
and of how we study things
that change in the sky,

00:13:46.124 --> 00:13:47.854
and it will do all of this

00:13:47.878 --> 00:13:50.120
largely without much
human intervention at all.

00:13:50.144 --> 00:13:52.111
It will follow that preset pattern

00:13:52.135 --> 00:13:55.632
and computationally find
anything that's changed or appeared.

00:13:56.611 --> 00:13:58.516
This might sound a little sad at first,

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.480
this idea that we're removing
people from stargazing.

00:14:01.964 --> 00:14:03.124
But in reality,

00:14:03.148 --> 00:14:05.492
our role as astronomers
isn't disappearing,

00:14:05.516 --> 00:14:06.956
it's just moving.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.674
We've already seen
how we do our jobs change.

00:14:09.698 --> 00:14:12.025
We've gone from perching atop telescopes

00:14:12.049 --> 00:14:13.468
to sitting next to them

00:14:13.492 --> 00:14:16.882
to not even needing to go to them
or send them commands at all.

00:14:17.276 --> 00:14:19.376
Where astronomers still shine

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.343
is in asking questions
and working with the data.

00:14:22.367 --> 00:14:25.178
Gathering data is only the first step.

00:14:25.202 --> 00:14:29.979
Analyzing it is where we can really apply
what we know about the universe.

00:14:30.003 --> 00:14:33.297
Human curiosity is what makes us
ask questions like:

00:14:33.321 --> 00:14:35.422
How big is the universe?
How did it begin?

00:14:35.446 --> 00:14:38.277
How's it going to end? And are we alone?

00:14:38.301 --> 00:14:42.710
So this is the power that humans
are still able to bring to astronomy.

00:14:43.195 --> 00:14:46.131
So compare the capabilities
of a telescope like this

00:14:46.155 --> 00:14:49.715
with the observations
that we were able to take like this.

00:14:49.739 --> 00:14:52.907
We discovered amazing things
with glass plates,

00:14:52.931 --> 00:14:55.040
but discovery looks different today.

00:14:55.064 --> 00:14:57.777
The way we do astronomy
looks different today.

00:14:57.801 --> 00:15:01.244
What hasn't changed
is that seed of human curiosity.

00:15:01.746 --> 00:15:05.175
If we can harness the power
of tomorrow's technology

00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:08.715
and combine it with this drive
that we all have to look up

00:15:08.739 --> 00:15:11.334
and to ask questions
about what we see there,

00:15:11.358 --> 00:15:14.117
we'll be ready to learn
some incredible new things

00:15:14.141 --> 00:15:15.517
about the universe.

00:15:15.541 --> 00:15:16.749
Thank you.

00:15:16.773 --> 00:15:18.946
(Applause)
