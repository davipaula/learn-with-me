00:00:06.971 --> 00:00:11.031
Centuries ago, the Inca developed 
ingenuous suits of armor

00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:15.871
that could flex 
with the blows of sharp spears and maces,

00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:20.277
protecting warriors 
from even the fiercest physical attacks.

00:00:20.277 --> 00:00:24.557
These hardy structures 
were made not from iron or steel,

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:28.765
but rather something unexpectedly soft: 
cotton.

00:00:28.765 --> 00:00:31.976
These thickly woven, 
layered quilts of cotton

00:00:31.976 --> 00:00:36.205
could distribute the energy from a blow 
across a large surface area,

00:00:36.205 --> 00:00:40.479
shielding warriors 
without restricting their mobility.

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:42.990
These seemingly contradictory features—

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.815
strength and flexibility, 
softness and durability—

00:00:46.815 --> 00:00:52.625
have their roots in the intricate biology 
of the nearly invisible cotton fiber.

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:56.575
These fibers begin life 
deep within a cotton flower,

00:00:56.575 --> 00:00:58.565
on the surface of a seed.

00:00:58.565 --> 00:01:03.157
As many as 16,000 fibers 
will festoon a single seed,

00:01:03.157 --> 00:01:07.530
bulging from the seed’s surface 
like miniature water balloons.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.750
Each cotton fiber, 
no matter how large it grows,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.185
is made of just one cell.

00:01:13.185 --> 00:01:16.975
That cell has multiple layers 
of cell wall.

00:01:16.975 --> 00:01:20.115
After a few days, 
the sides of the first layer,

00:01:20.115 --> 00:01:22.245
called the primary cell wall,

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:25.605
stiffen, pushing cell growth 
in one direction

00:01:25.605 --> 00:01:28.575
and causing the fiber to elongate.

00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:32.345
The fiber elongates 
quickly for about 16 days.

00:01:32.345 --> 00:01:36.510
Then it begins the next stage: 
strengthening the cell wall.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.765
It does this by making more 
of the carbohydrate cellulose.

00:01:40.765 --> 00:01:45.035
Cellulose will make up 
34% of the cell wall at this stage

00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:47.110
and swiftly increases.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.250
This new growth 
also reinforces the cell wall

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.670
by going against the grain 
of the existing wall.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.049
The strengthened wall is more rigid, 
restricting further growth.

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.554
That means if the fiber 
remodels its walls too early,

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:02.584
it will be short,

00:02:02.584 --> 00:02:05.904
and ultimately make rough, weak fabrics.

00:02:05.904 --> 00:02:08.750
But if cell wall strengthening 
begins too late,

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.920
the wall won’t be sturdy enough—

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.100
producing fibers that are too weak 
to hold fabrics together well.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.096
In ideal growing conditions—

00:02:17.096 --> 00:02:23.892
with the right temperature, water, 
fertilizer, pest control, and light—

00:02:23.892 --> 00:02:28.472
a cotton fiber can grow 
up to 3.6 centimeters long

00:02:28.472 --> 00:02:32.082
with only a 25 micrometer width.

00:02:32.082 --> 00:02:35.070
Long, fine fibers 
can wrap around one another

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.800
better than shorter, 
less fine fibers,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.740
which means those long, fine fibers 
make stronger threads

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.279
that hang together better as fabric.

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:47.150
Cotton with these qualities 
has diverse uses—

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.090
from soft textiles 
to the U.S. dollar bill,

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.143
which is 75% cotton.

00:02:53.143 --> 00:02:56.058
The next crucial stage 
of the cotton fiber’s growth

00:02:56.058 --> 00:02:59.348
begins as it thickens 
its secondary cell wall

00:02:59.348 --> 00:03:04.037
by depositing large quantities 
of cellulose into the secondary layer.

00:03:04.037 --> 00:03:08.507
Cellulose goes on to make up 
over 90% of the fiber’s weight.

00:03:08.507 --> 00:03:10.655
The more cellulose that gets deposited,

00:03:10.655 --> 00:03:13.278
the denser that secondary layer becomes—

00:03:13.278 --> 00:03:16.338
and this determines 
the strength of the final fiber.

00:03:16.338 --> 00:03:20.072
This stage is essential 
for developing long-lasting material

00:03:20.072 --> 00:03:22.618
for the likes of, say, a t-shirt.

00:03:22.618 --> 00:03:26.548
The garment’s capacity 
to withstand years of washing and wear

00:03:26.548 --> 00:03:30.958
is largely determined by the density 
of that secondary cell wall.

00:03:30.958 --> 00:03:31.995
On the other hand,

00:03:31.995 --> 00:03:35.800
its softness is strongly influenced 
by the length of the fiber,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.430
established with the remodeling 
of the primary wall layer.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.571
Finally, after about 50 days, 
the fiber is fully grown.

00:03:44.571 --> 00:03:47.170
The living matter 
within the cell dies off,

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.390
leaving behind only the cellulose.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.707
The dried cotton seed pod, or boll, 
that surrounds the fibers cracks open,

00:03:55.707 --> 00:04:01.175
unveiling a burst of several thousand 
fiber cells in a fluffy mass.

00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:05.115
The thread-like fibers we see— 
thinner than a human hair—

00:04:05.115 --> 00:04:09.819
are the remains of those dense, 
dried out walls of cellulose.

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.099
Tens of thousands of these fibers 
spun into yarn

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.535
will go on to make everything from fabric,
to coffee filters, diapers,

00:04:17.535 --> 00:04:19.110
and fishing nets.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.155
And with the help of modern science,

00:04:21.155 --> 00:04:26.092
cotton might soon be softer, stronger, 
and more resilient than ever

00:04:26.092 --> 00:04:29.522
as researchers investigate 
how to optimize its growth

00:04:29.522 --> 00:04:33.255
based on nutrients, weather conditions, 
and genetics.
