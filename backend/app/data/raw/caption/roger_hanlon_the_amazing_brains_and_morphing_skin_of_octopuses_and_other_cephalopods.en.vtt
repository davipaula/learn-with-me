00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:17.452
This is a strange and wonderful brain,

00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:22.973
one that gives rise to an idea
of a kind of alternative intelligence

00:00:22.997 --> 00:00:24.163
on this planet.

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.941
This is a brain that is formed
in a very strange body,

00:00:29.894 --> 00:00:33.837
one that has the equivalent
of small satellite brains

00:00:33.861 --> 00:00:36.660
distributed throughout that body.

00:00:36.684 --> 00:00:39.762
How different is it from the human brain?

00:00:39.786 --> 00:00:41.930
Very different, so it seems,

00:00:41.954 --> 00:00:46.285
so much so that my colleagues and I
are struggling to understand

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:47.678
how that brain works.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.492
But what I can tell you for certain

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:54.954
is that this brain is capable
of some amazing things.

00:00:55.435 --> 00:00:58.375
So, who does this brain belong to?

00:00:59.153 --> 00:01:02.420
Well, join me for a little bit
of diving into the ocean,

00:01:02.444 --> 00:01:04.374
where life began,

00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:06.105
and let's have a look.

00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:09.505
You may have seen some of this before,

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:12.938
but we're behind a coral reef,
and there's this rock out there,

00:01:12.962 --> 00:01:15.504
a lot of sand, fishes swimming around ...

00:01:15.528 --> 00:01:18.068
And all of a sudden this octopus appears,

00:01:18.092 --> 00:01:20.590
and now it flashes white,

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:22.336
inks in my face and jets away.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.589
In slow motion reverse,

00:01:23.613 --> 00:01:25.675
you see the ring develop around the eye,

00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:28.047
and then the pattern develops in the skin.

00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:31.487
And now watch the 3-D texture
of the skin change

00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:35.136
to really create this
beautiful, 3-D camouflage.

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:41.851
So there are 25 million color organs
called "chromatophores" in the skin,

00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:44.866
and all those bumps out there,
which we call "papillae,"

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.367
and they're all neurally controlled
and can change instantaneously.

00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:51.774
I would argue that dynamic camouflage

00:01:51.798 --> 00:01:54.434
is a form of "intelligence."

00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:58.576
The level of complexity of the skin
with fast precision change

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.682
is really quite astonishing.

00:02:00.706 --> 00:02:03.286
So what can you do with this skin?

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.738
Well, let's think a little bit
about other things besides camouflage

00:02:06.762 --> 00:02:08.612
that they can do with their skin.

00:02:08.636 --> 00:02:11.489
Here you see the mimic octopus
and a pattern.

00:02:11.513 --> 00:02:13.545
All of a sudden,
it changes dramatically --

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.194
that's signaling, not camouflage.

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:17.416
And then it goes back
to the normal pattern.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.686
Then you see the broadclub cuttlefish

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.189
showing this passing cloud display
as it approaches a crab prey.

00:02:24.213 --> 00:02:27.877
And finally, you see the flamboyant
cuttlefish in camouflage

00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:32.278
and it can shift instantly
to this bright warning display.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.734
What we have here
is a sliding scale of expression,

00:02:37.758 --> 00:02:39.369
a continuum, if you will,

00:02:39.393 --> 00:02:42.460
between conspicuousness and camouflage.

00:02:42.484 --> 00:02:44.885
And this requires a lot of control.

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.083
Well, guess what?

00:02:46.107 --> 00:02:48.711
Brains are really good for control.

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:53.072
The brain of the octopus shown here
has 35 lobes to the brain,

00:02:53.096 --> 00:02:55.491
80 million tiny cells.

00:02:55.515 --> 00:02:58.133
And even though that's interesting,

00:02:58.157 --> 00:03:00.457
what's really odd is that
the skin of this animal

00:03:00.481 --> 00:03:04.728
has many more neurons, as illustrated
here, especially in the yellow.

00:03:04.752 --> 00:03:07.736
There are 300 million neurons in the skin

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.900
and only 80 million in the brain itself --

00:03:09.924 --> 00:03:11.455
four times as many.

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:13.072
Now, if you look at that,

00:03:13.096 --> 00:03:16.953
there's actually one of those
little satellite brains

00:03:16.977 --> 00:03:20.053
and the equivalent of the spinal cord
for each of the eight arms.

00:03:20.077 --> 00:03:23.792
This is a very unusual way
to construct a nervous system in a body.

00:03:23.816 --> 00:03:25.734
Well, what is that brain good for?

00:03:25.758 --> 00:03:29.395
That brain has to outwit
other big, smart brains

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:31.117
that are trying to eat it,

00:03:31.141 --> 00:03:34.206
and that includes porpoises and seals

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.846
and barracudas and sharks

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.746
and even us humans.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.558
So decision-making is one of the things
that this brain has to do,

00:03:42.582 --> 00:03:44.307
and it does a very good job of it.

00:03:44.331 --> 00:03:47.617
Shown here, you see this octopus
perambulating along,

00:03:47.641 --> 00:03:51.488
and then it suddenly stops
and creates that perfect camouflage.

00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:53.197
And it's really marvelous,

00:03:53.221 --> 00:03:56.007
because when these animals
forage in the wild,

00:03:56.031 --> 00:03:58.977
they have to make over a hundred
camouflaging decisions

00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:00.252
in a two-hour forage,

00:04:00.276 --> 00:04:01.831
and they do that twice a day.

00:04:01.855 --> 00:04:03.023
So, decision-making.

00:04:03.047 --> 00:04:06.193
They're also figuring out where to go
and how to get back home.

00:04:06.217 --> 00:04:08.059
So it's a decision-making thing.

00:04:08.083 --> 00:04:09.591
We can test this camouflage,

00:04:09.615 --> 00:04:11.706
like that cuttlefish you see behind me,

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.670
where we pull the rug out from under it

00:04:13.694 --> 00:04:15.187
and give it a checkerboard,

00:04:15.211 --> 00:04:17.625
and it even uses that strange
visual information

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:21.227
and does its best to match the pattern
with a little ad-libbing.

00:04:21.563 --> 00:04:24.513
So other cognitive skills
are important, too.

00:04:24.537 --> 00:04:28.191
The squids have a different
kind of smarts, if you will.

00:04:28.215 --> 00:04:32.876
They have an extremely complex,
interesting sex life.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.999
They have fighting and flirting
and courting and mate-guarding

00:04:38.023 --> 00:04:39.794
and deception.

00:04:40.131 --> 00:04:41.534
Sound familiar?

00:04:41.558 --> 00:04:42.607
(Laughter)

00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:44.151
And it's really quite amazing

00:04:44.175 --> 00:04:47.932
that these animals have
this kind of intuitive ability

00:04:47.956 --> 00:04:49.410
to do these behaviors.

00:04:49.434 --> 00:04:51.046
Here you see a male and a female.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.758
The male, on the left,
has been fighting off other males

00:04:53.782 --> 00:04:54.948
to pair with the female,

00:04:54.972 --> 00:04:56.712
and now he's showing a dual pattern.

00:04:56.736 --> 00:04:59.031
He shows courtship and love on her side,

00:04:59.055 --> 00:05:00.726
fighting on the other.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.923
Watch him when she shifts places --

00:05:02.947 --> 00:05:03.980
(Laughter)

00:05:04.004 --> 00:05:07.573
and you see that he has fluidly
changed the love-courtship pattern

00:05:07.597 --> 00:05:09.151
to the side of the female.

00:05:10.015 --> 00:05:12.457
So this kind of dual signaling
simultaneously

00:05:12.481 --> 00:05:14.631
with a changing behavioral context

00:05:14.655 --> 00:05:16.145
is really extraordinary.

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:17.799
It takes a lot of brain power.

00:05:17.823 --> 00:05:20.357
Now, another way
to look at this is that, hmm,

00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:24.174
maybe we have 50 million years
of evidence for the two-faced male.

00:05:24.198 --> 00:05:28.204
(Laughter)

00:05:29.188 --> 00:05:30.740
All right, let's move on.

00:05:30.764 --> 00:05:31.821
(Laughter)

00:05:31.845 --> 00:05:34.650
An octopus on a coral reef
has a tough job in front it

00:05:34.674 --> 00:05:38.370
to go to so many places,
remember and find its den.

00:05:38.394 --> 00:05:39.937
And they do this extremely well.

00:05:39.961 --> 00:05:41.804
They have short- and long-term memory,

00:05:41.828 --> 00:05:43.920
they learn things
in three to five trials --

00:05:43.944 --> 00:05:45.099
it's a good brain.

00:05:45.123 --> 00:05:48.004
And the spatial memory is unusually good.

00:05:48.028 --> 00:05:51.660
They will even end their forage
and make a beeline

00:05:51.684 --> 00:05:53.245
all the way back to their den.

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:55.559
The divers watching them
are completely lost,

00:05:55.583 --> 00:05:56.743
but they can get back,

00:05:56.767 --> 00:06:00.329
so it's really quite refined
memory capability.

00:06:00.353 --> 00:06:01.988
Now, in terms of cognitive skills,

00:06:02.012 --> 00:06:04.863
look at this sleeping behavior
in the cuttlefish.

00:06:04.887 --> 00:06:07.269
Especially on the right,
you see the eye twitching.

00:06:07.293 --> 00:06:10.455
This is rapid eye movement
kind of dreaming

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.651
that we only thought
mammals and birds did.

00:06:12.675 --> 00:06:14.741
And you see the false color
we put in there

00:06:14.765 --> 00:06:17.164
to see the skin patterning flashing,

00:06:17.188 --> 00:06:19.502
and this is what's happening a lot.

00:06:19.526 --> 00:06:22.930
But it's not normal awake behaviors;
it's all different.

00:06:22.954 --> 00:06:27.055
Well, dreaming is when you have
memory consolidation,

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:30.483
and so this is probably
what's happening in the cuttlefish.

00:06:30.507 --> 00:06:32.858
Now, another form of memory
that's really unusual

00:06:32.882 --> 00:06:34.621
is episodic-like memory.

00:06:34.645 --> 00:06:39.527
This is something that humans need
four years of brain development to do

00:06:39.551 --> 00:06:42.534
to remember what happened
during a particular event,

00:06:42.558 --> 00:06:44.985
where it happened and when it happened.

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:48.089
The "when" part is particularly difficult,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.615
and these children can do that.

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:52.810
But guess what?

00:06:52.834 --> 00:06:57.011
We find recently that the wily cuttlefish
also has this ability,

00:06:57.035 --> 00:06:58.875
and in experiments last summer,

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:05.084
when you present a cuttlefish
with different foods at different times,

00:07:05.108 --> 00:07:09.525
they have to match that
with where it was exactly

00:07:09.549 --> 00:07:12.671
and when was the last time they saw it.

00:07:12.695 --> 00:07:17.143
Then they have to guide their foraging
to the rate of replenishment

00:07:17.167 --> 00:07:19.374
of each food type in a different place.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.338
Sound complicated?

00:07:21.362 --> 00:07:24.274
It's so complicated, I hardly
understood the experiment.

00:07:24.298 --> 00:07:27.871
So this is really high-level
cognitive processing.

00:07:28.927 --> 00:07:32.602
Now, speaking of brains
and evolution at the moment,

00:07:32.626 --> 00:07:36.489
you look on the right, there's the pathway
of vertebrate brain evolution,

00:07:36.513 --> 00:07:37.885
and we all have good brains.

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:39.830
I think everyone will acknowledge that.

00:07:39.854 --> 00:07:41.451
But if you look on the left side,

00:07:41.475 --> 00:07:45.888
some of the evolutionary pathway
outlined here to the octopus,

00:07:45.912 --> 00:07:50.265
they have both converged, if you will,
to complex behaviors

00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:52.475
and some form of intelligence.

00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:56.034
The last common denominator
in these two lines

00:07:56.058 --> 00:07:58.080
was 600 million years ago,

00:07:58.104 --> 00:08:00.457
and it was a worm with very few neurons,

00:08:00.481 --> 00:08:02.556
so very divergent paths

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.415
but convergence of complicated behavior.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.507
Here is the fundamental question:

00:08:08.531 --> 00:08:11.697
Is the brain structure of an octopus

00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:14.339
basically different
down to the tiniest level

00:08:14.363 --> 00:08:16.220
from the vertebrate line?

00:08:16.244 --> 00:08:18.272
Now, we don't know the answer,

00:08:18.296 --> 00:08:20.770
but if it turns out to be yes,

00:08:20.794 --> 00:08:23.636
then we have a different
evolutionary pathway

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.392
to create intelligence on planet Earth,

00:08:26.416 --> 00:08:29.348
and one might think that
the artificial intelligence community

00:08:29.372 --> 00:08:31.900
might be interested in those mechanisms.

00:08:32.736 --> 00:08:35.814
Well, let's talk genetics
just for a moment.

00:08:35.838 --> 00:08:38.733
We have genomes, we have DNA,

00:08:38.757 --> 00:08:40.933
DNA is transcripted into RNA,

00:08:40.957 --> 00:08:45.228
RNA translates that into a protein,
and that's how we come to be.

00:08:45.252 --> 00:08:47.571
Well, the cephalopods do it differently.

00:08:47.595 --> 00:08:50.807
They have big genomes, they have DNA,

00:08:50.831 --> 00:08:52.775
they transcript it into RNA,

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:55.307
but now something
dramatically different happens.

00:08:55.331 --> 00:08:58.435
They edit that RNA
at an astronomical weird rate,

00:08:58.459 --> 00:09:02.575
a hundredfold more than
we as humans or other animals do.

00:09:02.599 --> 00:09:05.733
And it produces scores of proteins.

00:09:05.757 --> 00:09:08.103
And guess where most of them are for?

00:09:08.127 --> 00:09:09.465
The nervous system.

00:09:09.489 --> 00:09:12.749
So perhaps this is an unorthodox way

00:09:12.773 --> 00:09:16.537
for an animal to evolve
behavioral plasticity.

00:09:16.854 --> 00:09:19.896
This is a lot of conjecture,
but it's food for thought.

00:09:20.601 --> 00:09:23.125
Now, I'd like to share
with you for a moment

00:09:23.149 --> 00:09:27.974
my experience, and using my smarts
and that of my colleagues,

00:09:27.998 --> 00:09:29.994
to try and get this kind of information.

00:09:30.018 --> 00:09:32.187
We're diving, we can't stay
underwater forever

00:09:32.211 --> 00:09:33.559
because we can't breathe it,

00:09:33.583 --> 00:09:35.561
so we have to be efficient in what we do.

00:09:35.585 --> 00:09:37.900
The total sensory immersion
into that world

00:09:37.924 --> 00:09:41.418
is what helps us understand
what these animals are really doing,

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:46.338
and I have to tell you that
it's really an amazing experience

00:09:46.362 --> 00:09:49.615
to be down there and having
this communication

00:09:49.639 --> 00:09:51.538
with an octopus and a diver

00:09:51.562 --> 00:09:56.059
when you really begin to understand
that this is a thinking, cogitating,

00:09:56.083 --> 00:09:57.537
curious animal.

00:09:57.939 --> 00:10:01.294
And this is the kind of thing
that really inspires me endlessly.

00:10:01.318 --> 00:10:03.769
Let's go back to that smart skin
for a few moments.

00:10:03.793 --> 00:10:06.608
Here's a squid and a camouflage pattern.

00:10:06.632 --> 00:10:09.861
We zoom down and we see
there's beautiful pigments and reflectors.

00:10:09.885 --> 00:10:13.084
There are the chromatophores
opening and closing very quickly.

00:10:13.108 --> 00:10:15.356
And then, in the next layer of skin,

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.600
it's quite interesting.

00:10:16.624 --> 00:10:18.103
The chromatophores are closed,

00:10:18.127 --> 00:10:22.259
and you see this magical iridescence
just come out of the skin.

00:10:22.283 --> 00:10:24.362
This is also neurally controlled,

00:10:24.386 --> 00:10:26.357
so it's the combination of the two,

00:10:26.381 --> 00:10:29.967
as seen here in the high-resolution
skin of the cuttlefish,

00:10:29.991 --> 00:10:34.053
where you get this beautiful
pigmentary structural coloration

00:10:34.077 --> 00:10:37.496
and even the faint blushing
that is so beautiful.

00:10:38.211 --> 00:10:42.207
Well, how can we make use
of some of this information?

00:10:42.231 --> 00:10:44.410
I talked about those
skin bumps, the papillae.

00:10:44.434 --> 00:10:46.492
Here's the giant Australian cuttlefish.

00:10:46.516 --> 00:10:49.250
It's got smooth skin
and a conspicuous pattern.

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:51.951
I took five pictures in a row
one second apart,

00:10:51.975 --> 00:10:58.019
and just watch this animal morph --
one, two, three, four, five --

00:10:58.043 --> 00:10:59.534
and now I'm a seaweed.

00:10:59.558 --> 00:11:01.542
And then we can come right back out of it

00:11:01.566 --> 00:11:04.631
to see the smooth skin
and the conspicuousness.

00:11:04.655 --> 00:11:07.456
So this is really
marvelous, morphing skin.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.647
You can see it in more detail here.

00:11:09.671 --> 00:11:10.859
Periscope up,

00:11:10.883 --> 00:11:13.065
and you've got those beautiful papillae.

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:15.264
And then we look in a little more detail,

00:11:15.288 --> 00:11:17.777
you can see the individual
papillae come up,

00:11:17.801 --> 00:11:19.584
and there are little ridges on there,

00:11:19.608 --> 00:11:21.857
so it's a papilla on papilla and so forth.

00:11:21.881 --> 00:11:26.533
Every individual species out there
has more than a dozen shapes and sizes

00:11:26.557 --> 00:11:27.710
of those bumps

00:11:27.734 --> 00:11:31.805
to create fine-tuned,
neurally controlled camouflage.

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:38.249
So now, my colleagues
at Cornell, engineers,

00:11:38.273 --> 00:11:41.337
watched our work and said,
"We think we can make some of those."

00:11:41.361 --> 00:11:42.959
Because in industry and society,

00:11:42.983 --> 00:11:45.442
this kind of soft materials
under control of shape

00:11:45.466 --> 00:11:46.857
are really very rare.

00:11:46.881 --> 00:11:48.961
And they went ahead, worked with us

00:11:48.985 --> 00:11:52.933
and made the first samples
of artificial papillae, soft materials,

00:11:52.957 --> 00:11:54.120
shown here.

00:11:54.144 --> 00:11:56.680
And you see them blown up
into different shapes,

00:11:56.704 --> 00:11:58.727
And then you can press your finger on them

00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:01.536
to see that they're
a little bit malleable as they are.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.773
And so this is an example
of how that might work.

00:12:04.797 --> 00:12:09.560
Well, I want to segue from this
into the color of fabrics,

00:12:09.584 --> 00:12:12.870
and I imagine that could have
a lot of applications as well.

00:12:12.894 --> 00:12:15.489
Just look at this kaleidoscope of color

00:12:15.513 --> 00:12:17.931
of dynamically controlled
pigments and reflectors

00:12:17.955 --> 00:12:20.290
that we see in the cephalopods.

00:12:20.314 --> 00:12:23.992
We know enough about
the mechanics of how they work

00:12:24.016 --> 00:12:26.149
that we can begin to translate this

00:12:26.173 --> 00:12:27.666
not only into fabrics

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:31.216
but perhaps even
into changeable cosmetics.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.210
And moreover, there's been
the recent discovery

00:12:34.234 --> 00:12:37.745
of light-sensing molecules
in the skin of octopus

00:12:37.769 --> 00:12:41.339
which may pave the way
to, eventually, smart materials

00:12:41.363 --> 00:12:45.392
that sense and respond on their own.

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:51.516
Well, this form of biotechnology,
or biomimicry, if you will,

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.499
could change the way we look
at the world even above water.

00:12:54.523 --> 00:12:57.213
Take, for example, artificial intelligence

00:12:57.237 --> 00:13:01.210
that might be inspired
by the body-distributed brain

00:13:01.234 --> 00:13:03.072
and behavior of the octopus

00:13:03.096 --> 00:13:05.388
or the smart skin of a cuttlefish

00:13:05.412 --> 00:13:08.993
translated into cutting-edge fashion.

00:13:12.003 --> 00:13:13.874
Well, how do we get there?

00:13:13.898 --> 00:13:15.873
Maybe all we have to do

00:13:15.897 --> 00:13:18.982
is to begin to be a little bit smarter

00:13:19.006 --> 00:13:21.482
about how smart the cephalopods are.

00:13:21.506 --> 00:13:22.697
Thank you.

00:13:22.721 --> 00:13:27.135
(Applause)
