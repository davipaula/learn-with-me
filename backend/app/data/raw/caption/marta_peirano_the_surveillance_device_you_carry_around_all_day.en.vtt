00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.997
We make three mistakes:

00:00:16.997 --> 00:00:21.427
the first is underestimating the quantity
of information that we produce every day;

00:00:21.887 --> 00:00:25.947
the second is depreciating
the value of that information;

00:00:25.947 --> 00:00:29.612
and the third is thinking
that our principal problem

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:32.933
is a distant and super powerful agency
that is called NSA.

00:00:33.472 --> 00:00:38.170
And it is true that NSA
has the major access, better resources,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.190
the best tools,
but they don't need any of that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.663
to spy on us,

00:00:42.663 --> 00:00:46.493
because we have everything there;
we live in glass houses.

00:00:48.127 --> 00:00:51.843
This is Malte Spitz, a member
of the German Green Party.

00:00:51.843 --> 00:00:55.613
In 2009, Malte asked
his telephone company

00:00:55.613 --> 00:00:58.024
to send him all the data they had on him.

00:00:58.024 --> 00:01:00.894
And the Deutsche Telekom,
which was his company, told him no.

00:01:01.345 --> 00:01:04.259
Two lawsuits later, they sent him a CD

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.889
with an Excel table of 30,832 lines;

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:11.451
like "The War and the Peace",
but three times larger.

00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:13.753
This endless document
contains information

00:01:13.753 --> 00:01:16.503
from September of 2009
to February of 2010;

00:01:16.503 --> 00:01:18.423
it has exactly six months.

00:01:18.423 --> 00:01:21.885
This isn't accidental, it has six months
because in the summer of 2008

00:01:21.885 --> 00:01:25.508
the European Union presented
the Data Retention Directive,

00:01:25.508 --> 00:01:27.508
where they demanded
each telephone company

00:01:27.508 --> 00:01:28.888
with more than 10,000 clients

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:30.618
keep the data of all their clients

00:01:30.618 --> 00:01:33.971
for a minimum of six months
and a maximum of two years.

00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:36.251
They gave Malte data
of 6 months, as if saying,

00:01:36.251 --> 00:01:38.871
"This is everything we have
because the law forces us."

00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:40.681
They probably owe him a year and half.

00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:43.871
Malte, who couldn't process
this amount of information,

00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:45.391
sent it to a weekly magazine

00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:47.882
which, in turn, contacted
a data visualization agency

00:01:47.882 --> 00:01:49.212
to do something with it.

00:01:49.212 --> 00:01:52.072
They took the data from Deutsche Telekom

00:01:52.072 --> 00:01:54.862
and Malte's public information,

00:01:54.862 --> 00:01:58.052
like, for example, information
from his Twitter account or his blog.

00:01:58.052 --> 00:02:01.562
And with this they created the map
that you are looking at now,

00:02:01.562 --> 00:02:07.284
that is more than a map,
it is more like a creepy automatic diary

00:02:07.284 --> 00:02:08.814
of Malte's life.

00:02:08.814 --> 00:02:11.764
We can see when he catches a train,
which he's doing right now,

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:13.804
when he stops, where he stays,

00:02:13.804 --> 00:02:15.802
when he goes, how he goes,

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.942
how much time it takes him,
when he is eating,

00:02:17.942 --> 00:02:19.842
when he is sleeping,
like right now;

00:02:19.842 --> 00:02:22.602
when he takes a flight,
who calls him, how long they speak,

00:02:22.602 --> 00:02:24.842
who sends him messages,
what are the messages.

00:02:24.842 --> 00:02:26.359
We see everything.

00:02:28.924 --> 00:02:31.224
This is on the Internet. You can see it.

00:02:31.224 --> 00:02:33.847
The reason why this happens

00:02:33.847 --> 00:02:36.697
is because Malte
has a mobile in his pocket

00:02:36.697 --> 00:02:40.827
that every five minutes makes a "ping"
to the closest antenna and tells it,

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.987
"Do you have something for me?
Do I have mail?

00:02:42.987 --> 00:02:44.537
Do I have any WhatsApp messages?

00:02:45.571 --> 00:02:47.391
Has something happened in the world?"

00:02:48.643 --> 00:02:51.973
Raise your hand if you have a mobile
in your pocket that does the same.

00:02:53.885 --> 00:02:57.245
Every five minutes
our mobiles are saying,

00:02:57.245 --> 00:02:59.425
"I'm here, I'm here, now I'm here,

00:02:59.425 --> 00:03:00.965
hey, I'm here..."

00:03:00.965 --> 00:03:01.965
That's what happens.

00:03:01.965 --> 00:03:05.365
And this doesn't have precedents.
We didn't have this before.

00:03:05.946 --> 00:03:09.416
The direct equivalent of that
is what we have now on the screen.

00:03:09.416 --> 00:03:13.771
This is the profile of a person
watched by the Stasi for years.

00:03:14.384 --> 00:03:18.544
Looks like a napkin, doesn't it?
With 46 posts including

00:03:18.544 --> 00:03:22.094
his aunt, the milkman,
the priest of his church --

00:03:22.594 --> 00:03:26.720
These are five minutes
in the life of Malte Spitz,

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.470
and this information is automatic.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.230
And the worst thing is that
this is only the data on Malte,

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.760
but Malte is surrounded by people
like us with mobiles like his

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.410
that are producing the same information;

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.581
and that company sees everything.

00:03:40.205 --> 00:03:43.855
This is a photo made
by my colleague Juanlu Sánchez,

00:03:43.855 --> 00:03:45.485
a photo from manifestation 15-M.

00:03:45.977 --> 00:03:48.837
But let's look at it from a
telecommunications' viewpoint.

00:03:48.837 --> 00:03:50.777
This square is full with mobiles.

00:03:51.512 --> 00:03:54.562
Using those mobiles we can know
exactly who is at the square,

00:03:54.562 --> 00:03:56.812
almost as if we put a cordon around;

00:03:56.812 --> 00:03:58.092
with names and surnames.

00:03:58.092 --> 00:04:02.062
And not only we know when they have come,
where they come from and with whom,

00:04:02.062 --> 00:04:04.072
whom they leave with, whom they call to;

00:04:04.072 --> 00:04:06.163
we know everything about them.

00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:10.023
We even know if they are on the 4th floor
or down at the square.

00:04:11.412 --> 00:04:17.252
This is how that photo is seen
by an algorithm of traffic analysis.

00:04:17.252 --> 00:04:20.855
And here we begin to see some cool stuff.

00:04:20.855 --> 00:04:24.875
We see that not all the people
at the square are the same.

00:04:25.374 --> 00:04:28.060
There are people
more important than others,

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.285
and if we have control
over these telecommunications,

00:04:31.285 --> 00:04:32.762
this network, we can do things,

00:04:32.762 --> 00:04:35.938
like turning off the nodes
on this square,

00:04:35.938 --> 00:04:40.771
in other words, isolate those who gather
others around them from the rest.

00:04:41.417 --> 00:04:45.427
Also we can do what the Ukrainian
government did about a year and half ago:

00:04:45.427 --> 00:04:48.630
send out a message saying,

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.210
"Dear user, you've been registered

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.300
as a participant in a massive
illegal manifestation."

00:04:57.771 --> 00:05:00.798
We don't behave the same
when we know that we are watched.

00:05:00.798 --> 00:05:02.258
Since Jeremy Bentham we know

00:05:02.258 --> 00:05:04.138
that the best way to watch a population

00:05:04.138 --> 00:05:07.117
is for them not to know
when they are watched and when not.

00:05:07.577 --> 00:05:09.392
In Malte's case,
during those 6 months,

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:12.112
they were watching him
for 78 percent of the time.

00:05:13.338 --> 00:05:17.048
And we're only talking about our mobiles.

00:05:17.048 --> 00:05:19.764
We are not talking about our computers,

00:05:19.764 --> 00:05:21.674
nor the cameras that are on the streets,

00:05:21.674 --> 00:05:23.154
in the stores and shop-windows,

00:05:23.154 --> 00:05:24.794
in the airports and trains,

00:05:24.794 --> 00:05:27.124
and wherever we are, being watched.

00:05:27.124 --> 00:05:30.037
We are not talking
about the radars on the roads

00:05:30.037 --> 00:05:32.457
that register us if we overspeed.

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:34.817
We are not talking about
what we have in a wallet.

00:05:35.328 --> 00:05:39.198
How many personal identification chips
do we have in a wallet?

00:05:39.202 --> 00:05:41.142
We have a lot: an ID card,

00:05:41.142 --> 00:05:43.101
a driving license or a transport ticket,

00:05:43.101 --> 00:05:46.031
credit or debit cards, reward cards.

00:05:46.491 --> 00:05:49.041
A supermarket reward card.

00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:52.551
20 years ago, the biggest
personal data base in the world

00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:57.241
was not owned by NSA,
neither by the Stasi, poor thing.

00:05:57.241 --> 00:06:00.511
It was owned by Wal-Mart,
the American supermarket chain.

00:06:00.511 --> 00:06:02.971
Why? Because when they
give you a reward card,

00:06:02.971 --> 00:06:06.561
what you're doing is telling a company
who you are, where you live,

00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:08.091
how much you earn, what you buy,

00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:09.854
what you eat, how many kids you have,

00:06:09.854 --> 00:06:11.927
when you go on vacations,
when you get sick.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.952
And all this we give them
hoping that in six months or in a year,

00:06:15.952 --> 00:06:18.650
if we spend a lot of money,
they'll give us a Tupperware.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.051
(Laughter)

00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:23.171
And it's not different from
what we do on the Internet,

00:06:23.171 --> 00:06:28.161
because Deutsche Telekom
is a legit European company

00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:32.341
that has to obey the Data Protection Law,
the same way as Telef贸nica.

00:06:32.341 --> 00:06:35.801
Telef贸nica, here, has to obey
the data protection laws,

00:06:35.801 --> 00:06:37.771
but it's not the same with the companies

00:06:37.771 --> 00:06:41.461
that make mobiles, operative systems,

00:06:41.461 --> 00:06:44.051
offer us "free" mails,

00:06:44.528 --> 00:06:46.508
give those apps that we download

00:06:46.508 --> 00:06:49.528
and ask us for access to a bunch
of strange things, and we say,

00:06:49.528 --> 00:06:51.198
"They might need it for something."

00:06:52.568 --> 00:06:54.108
They need it to sell it.

00:06:55.258 --> 00:06:58.348
Why would Angry Birds
want to have access to your GPS?

00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.108
To make money!

00:07:01.768 --> 00:07:05.458
Our observers don't care
if we are nobody,

00:07:05.458 --> 00:07:07.138
if we are unimportant,

00:07:07.138 --> 00:07:09.218
because they're algorithms, not people.

00:07:09.218 --> 00:07:10.708
And our profiles are automatic;

00:07:10.708 --> 00:07:12.629
they exist even if nobody looks at it.

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:15.839
And the day somebody looks at it
and changes your fate,

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:18.759
your profile, your history,
becomes your record.

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:22.465
You can end up being stuck at the airport

00:07:22.465 --> 00:07:25.905
in one of the 75 countries
where being homosexual is illegal.

00:07:26.495 --> 00:07:29.865
Or you could end up in a country
where taking a picture of a pharmacy

00:07:29.865 --> 00:07:33.465
of mass production from the other side
of the street is terrorism;

00:07:33.465 --> 00:07:35.145
this happens in the United States.

00:07:35.145 --> 00:07:38.845
Or you could end up in Syria,
where people are shot on the streets;

00:07:39.315 --> 00:07:41.735
activists, especially journalists.

00:07:41.735 --> 00:07:46.155
You could end up in Mexico, D.F.,
where the Zetas use their access

00:07:46.155 --> 00:07:49.095
to the information of phone companies

00:07:49.095 --> 00:07:51.955
to see who contacts the police
and cut their heads.

00:07:52.645 --> 00:07:55.975
There are thousands of ways to be
in the wrong place at the wrong time,

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:58.025
and sometimes
you don't even have to move.

00:07:58.725 --> 00:08:00.625
In Holland they had a census.

00:08:00.625 --> 00:08:04.285
It was a census that included religions
with high devotion rates in the world.

00:08:04.285 --> 00:08:08.065
They wanted to know how many
Protestants, Catholics, Jews they had

00:08:08.065 --> 00:08:10.735
to know how much money
they had to put in each community,

00:08:10.735 --> 00:08:12.495
in each church or synagogue.

00:08:13.075 --> 00:08:16.455
What happened? When the Nazis came,
they had their homework done.

00:08:16.455 --> 00:08:20.755
Only 10 percent of the Dutch Jews
survived in the Second World War.

00:08:20.755 --> 00:08:25.605
If that database hadn't exist,
the figures would've been very different.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.850
What I mean is that
our problem isn't the NSA,

00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:32.921
neither our corrupt governments,

00:08:32.921 --> 00:08:37.121
neither ambitious companies
that want to sell our data,

00:08:37.121 --> 00:08:38.811
neither bad people,

00:08:38.811 --> 00:08:41.171
and it has nothing to do
with their intentions,

00:08:41.171 --> 00:08:42.910
nor with their bad intentions.

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:46.621
The problem is that the very existence
of that information

00:08:46.621 --> 00:08:50.951
makes us vulnerable in the ways
that we can't anticipate right now.

00:08:51.806 --> 00:08:53.986
We have to put curtains in our houses;

00:08:53.986 --> 00:08:56.226
we can't expect
that somebody will do it for us.

00:08:56.226 --> 00:08:58.056
We have to put them now.

00:08:58.536 --> 00:09:01.216
We have to start using cryptography
in our mobiles,

00:09:01.216 --> 00:09:03.696
in our communications, in our computers.

00:09:03.696 --> 00:09:06.936
Start thinking twice every time
someone offers us a reward card,

00:09:06.936 --> 00:09:08.306
and say, "Mmm..."

00:09:09.016 --> 00:09:11.126
Not only for us, because
besides everything,

00:09:11.736 --> 00:09:14.986
this state of surveillance
is one of the worst sicknesses

00:09:14.986 --> 00:09:16.626
that a democracy has.

00:09:16.626 --> 00:09:19.356
So, I invite you,
upon your arrival back home,

00:09:19.356 --> 00:09:20.716
start using Tor,

00:09:21.696 --> 00:09:23.886
and if someone wants to see
what you are doing,

00:09:23.886 --> 00:09:25.550
he should ask for a search warrant.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:26.520
Thank you very much.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.070
(Applause)
