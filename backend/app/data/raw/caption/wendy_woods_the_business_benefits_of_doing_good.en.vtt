00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.456
A few years ago,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.096
all the developed
countries in the world --

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.376
the wealthier ones --

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.135
and all of the charities

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.696
together donated about 200 billion dollars

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.896
to developing countries in the world --

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.896
the ones that bear most of the burden,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.816
the heaviest burden
of the world's biggest problems:

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.880
poverty, hunger,
climate change and inequality.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.616
That same year,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.000
businesses invested in those same
countries 3.7 trillion dollars.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.336
Now, I get to travel a lot in my work

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.896
and I'm privileged
to see the amazing things

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.496
that NGOs and some governments are doing

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.640
with some of that 200 billion dollars:

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.416
helping malnourished children

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.216
or families that don't
have access to clean water,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.480
children who wouldn't
be educated otherwise.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.096
But it's not enough

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.856
because the biggest problems
in our world need trillions

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.320
not just billions.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.816
So if we're going to make
lasting and significant progress

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.816
in the big challenges in our world,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.656
we need business,

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.976
both the companies and the investors,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.520
to drive the solutions.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.040
So let's talk about
what business should do.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.456
And when I say that,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.576
you probably think that I'm going
to talk about corporate philanthropy

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.216
or corporate social responsibility.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.056
CSR is the norm today,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.480
and it's very useful.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.056
It provides a route
for corporate generosity

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.056
and that generosity is important
to many corporations' employees

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.280
and customers.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.776
But you know what?

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.376
It's just not big enough,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.616
or strong enough,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.176
or durable enough

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.536
to drive solutions to the biggest
problems in our world today

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.720
because it's incremental cost.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.360
Even when business is booming,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.360
CSR just isn't designed to scale.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.976
And then of course in a downturn,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.479
it's one of the first programs to be cut.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.976
So no,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.216
CSR --

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.256
corporate social responsibility --

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.336
isn't the answer,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.416
but TSI --

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.080
total societal impact, is.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.016
TSI is the sum of all of the ways

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.936
business can affect society

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.800
by doing the real work:

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.856
thinking about their supply chains,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.696
working on their product design
and manufacturing processes

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.480
and their distribution.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.336
The real work of business,

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.416
when done with innovation,

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.576
can actually create
core business benefits for the company

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.920
and it can solve the meaningful
problems in our world today.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.000
So what does TSI look like?

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.776
Focusing on TSI

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.880
means incorporating
social and environmental considerations.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.696
And you know what?

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.376
It's something that isn't completely new.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.280
It's been thought about for a while.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.096
But the hard part is that corporations
almost exclusively still think

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.840
about something called TSR:

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.400
total shareholder returns.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.176
But TSI --

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.536
total societal impact --

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.576
needs to stand alongside TSR

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.376
as an important and valid driver
of corporate strategy

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.120
and corporate decision-making.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.840
And we've got the data
to show you why and how.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.296
Some companies
are already making this happen.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.496
They're beginning to make it happen.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.736
So let me tell you the story about Mars.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.280
Mars is the sixth-largest private company
in the United States.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.416
If you're like me,

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.656
they make some important products,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.240
like coffee and chocolate.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.976
So not surprisingly,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.960
one of their most important
ingredients is cocoa.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.576
And some of their competitors
are actually really worried

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.240
about the sustainability
and the availability of cocoa supplies.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.456
But not Mars.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.080
They're confident in the stable supply
of that crop for the long term.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.680
And why is that?

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.136
It's because they partner
with NGOs around the world

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.040
that are working
with small shareholder farmers.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.896
And those certification agency's NGOs

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.456
are working to help farmers
improve crop yields,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.800
they're making sure that they get
a fair, premium, livable wage

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.496
and they're helping them address
any human rights potential issues

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.856
in supply chains,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.096
and they're helping minimize
the effects on the environment,

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.440
like deforestation.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.256
Mars is on a path
to 100 percent certified cocoa,

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.216
so this is a good program
for farming communities,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.816
it's a good program for the environment,

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.416
and it's a good program for Mars,

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.400
who has solved a significant risk
in their supply chain.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.096
But now let's get to the data,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.520
because it's actually really awesome.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.880
And let me explain exactly what the data
points I'm going to talk about are.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.896
When analysts and financial people
look at companies,

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.536
they think about
a lot of different statistics.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.976
I want to talk about
two of the most important ones.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.896
I'm going to talk about
the overall value of a company --

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.696
its valuation --

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.600
and I'm going to talk about its margin.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.816
Basically the difference
between all of its earnings

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.240
and all of its costs.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.776
So in our study,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.096
we looked at oil and gas companies,

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.656
and the oil and gas companies

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.256
that are performing
most strongly on TSI --

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.936
total societal impact --

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.240
see a 19 percent premium
on their valuation.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.360
19 percent.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.296
When they do really well

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.776
on things like minimizing
the impact of their company

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.096
on the environment and water,

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.200
and when they have very strong
occupational health and safety programs.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.536
And when they also add in
strong employee training programs,

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.256
they get a 3.4 percentage point
premium on their margins.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.200
But what about other industries?

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.096
Biopharmaceutical companies
that are the strongest performers on TSI

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.160
see a 12 percent premium
on their valuation.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.656
And then if they're best
at expanded access to medicines --

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.656
making medicines available
for the people who need them --

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:08.320
they see a 6.7 percentage point premium
on their gross margins.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.816
For the retail banks
that are strongest on TSI,

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.896
they see a three percentage point
premium on their valuation,

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.616
and then for those that differentially
provide financial inclusion --

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.536
access to financial products
for people who need it --

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:30.040
they see a 0.5 percentage point premium
in their net income margin.

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.216
Now, these numbers for banks
may not seem very big,

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.776
but in highly competitive industries,

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.360
even really small differences
in margin matter a lot.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.056
Now, what about those
consumer goods companies --

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.360
the ones who make those products we love
like coffee and chocolate?

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.136
Consumer goods companies
that perform best on total societal impact

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.440
see an 11 percent valuation premium.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.096
And then if they do those smart
things with their supply chain --

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.776
inclusive and responsibly
sourcing their product --

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:12.080
they see a 4.8 percentage point premium
on their gross margins.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.960
These numbers are significant.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.856
We've long known that things
like fundamental financials,

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.800
growth rates and financial risks
are key drivers of valuation,

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.856
but this rigorous analysis shows
that social and environmental factors --

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.296
total societal impact measures --

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:38.000
are also linked to valuations and margins.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.640
Wow.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.736
All else equal --

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.376
we didn't confuse
the analysis with anything.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.336
All else being equal,

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:53.015
companies that perform strongly
on social and environmental areas

00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:54.559
achieve higher margins

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.240
and higher valuations.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.896
Now, I do understand

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.080
that companies are under
a lot of short-term earnings pressures.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.896
But fortunately,

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.416
the investors who create
some of this pressure

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.096
are actually more and more themselves
starting to think longer-term

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:19.480
and starting to think with this TSI lens.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.776
In our conversations
and surveys with investors,

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.416
75 percent of them say
they expect to see improved revenues

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.216
and improved operating efficiency

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.920
for companies that are thinking
with a TSI lens.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.376
And they're actually starting
to incorporate this

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.440
in their own investing behavior.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.136
Last year,

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.616
23 trillion in global assets

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.600
were in the category
of socially responsible investing.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.800
Now, that's five billion
over just the last two years.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.440
And it represents a quarter of the total
global assets managed in the world.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:09.480
I know that some of you
may be cringing a little bit right now.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.416
Because in my decades
of strategy consulting

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.520
with businesses and NGOs
and governments around the world,

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.776
I find that many businesspeople

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.976
are hesitant to talk
or even sometimes think about

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.920
the business benefits of doing good.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.736
They somehow think
it's going to negate the value

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.456
of the benefits
they're creating for society.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:39.560
Or that they'll be perceived
as heartless or even mercenary.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.840
But we really do need
to think differently.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.336
We need to think differently

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.496
because the only way
we're going to make substantial progress

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.136
on the challenging problems of our time

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.280
is for business to drive the solutions.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.256
The job of business
is to meet customer needs

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.296
and to do so profitably.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.000
They need to to survive.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:10.936
So one of the best ways for businesses
to help ensure their own growth,

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.936
their own longevity,

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.120
is to meet some of the hardest
challenges in our society

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.320
and to do so profitably.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.456
And when they do that innovatively,

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.760
when they do that ethically,
responsibly, incredibly,

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.240
they should be proud.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.696
But if you still aren't sure about this,

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.880
let's talk about a few more examples.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.856
What if you're a technology company

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.536
and you're trying to grow your platform

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.720
and you're trying to grow your customers?

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.056
Like, Airbnb.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:55.776
Airbnb has a portfolio
of total societal impact activities.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.616
They're all spot-on their core business.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.976
In one initiative,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.096
they're helping enable their community

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.576
to provide housing for free
to those in disaster:

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.960
crisis survivors and relief workers.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.696
In another effort on their part,

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.536
they're actually helping
and working with NGOs

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.880
to ensure that people can provide
housing for free for refugees.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.336
Now, what I love about this program

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.976
is that I don't think
most people would've figured out

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.976
how to express their generosity

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.176
and open their homes
for those in such dire need --

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.216
certainly not so quickly
or so easily or efficiently --

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.840
without this innovation by Airbnb.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.816
But at the same time,

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.456
this is core to their corporate strategy

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.496
and core to their growth

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:49.656
because they grow by increasing
the number of hosts and guests

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.160
using their platform.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.536
But if they'd only
been thinking exclusively

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.056
about the return side of things,

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.256
I'm not sure they would have ever
figured out this route to growth,

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.560
because they're not
charging transaction fees.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.816
So it's a pretty exciting way,

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.736
when they were thinking
about how to bring their capabilities

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.376
to a need in society

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.240
and at the same time
drive their own growth.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.920
But what if you're trying to find
new customer segments?

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.096
Let's move to South Africa,

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.120
and let's talk about Standard Bank.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.376
In South Africa,

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.976
the government has a regulation

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.696
that requires all banks
to donate 0.2 percent of their profits

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.720
to small and medium
black-owned enterprises.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.376
And many banks just donate
this to the entrepreneurs,

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.776
but Standard Bank thought creatively.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.456
And what they did is they took those funds

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.056
and they invested them
in an independent trust,

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:54.536
and they used that trust to fund loans
to these black entrepreneurs.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.016
This is a highly leveraged model.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.616
They can support a lot more
entrepreneurs with capital,

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.536
and because their success
is completely intertwined

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.096
with the success of the entrepreneurs,

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:10.040
they're actually also using the fund
to provide technical assistance.

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.216
More entrepreneurs supported,

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.800
more people and communities
being lifted out of poverty.

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.736
And it's successful for Standard Bank.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.976
So successful that they're actually
working on expanding this program

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.880
to other areas in their portfolio.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.616
It's not like we haven't been trying
to solve the problems in our world

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.840
for a long time.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:35.560
We have, and they're still here.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.536
We're making progress,

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.456
but it's not far enough,

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.856
or fast enough,

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.280
or universal enough.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.840
We need to flip our thinking.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.216
We need to have business --

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.320
both companies and investors --

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.200
bring creative, innovative
corporate strategy and capital

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.640
to solving the biggest
problems in our world.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:07.400
And when they do that innovatively,

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.840
and when they do that

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.136
with all of their thinking
and all of their strategy

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.216
and all of their capital,

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.296
and they're creating
both total shareholder returns

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.856
and total societal impact,

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.816
we know that we will solve those problems,

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.880
both profitably and generously.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.936
Thank you.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.600
(Applause)
