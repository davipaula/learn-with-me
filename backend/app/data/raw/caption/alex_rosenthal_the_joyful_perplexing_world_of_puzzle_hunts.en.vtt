00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:16.198
It's 4am, you've been awake
for forty hours,

00:00:16.222 --> 00:00:19.603
when you unlock a puzzle
containing this video

00:00:19.627 --> 00:00:24.603
of some kind of dance-off between
a chicken and a roller-skating beaver.

00:00:24.627 --> 00:00:26.151
(Laughter)

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:28.462
The confusion and delight
you're experiencing

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:31.579
is a typical moment
at the MIT Mystery Hunt,

00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:33.944
which is basically the Olympics
meets Burning Man

00:00:33.968 --> 00:00:35.672
for a specific type of nerd.

00:00:35.696 --> 00:00:36.697
(Laughter)

00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:39.063
Today, I'm going to take you
inside this strange,

00:00:39.087 --> 00:00:42.378
intellectually masochistic
and incredibly joyful world.

00:00:42.858 --> 00:00:46.143
But first, I have to explain
what I mean when I say "puzzle."

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:49.953
A puzzle-hunt-style puzzle is a data set.

00:00:49.977 --> 00:00:54.787
It can be a grid of letters,
a sudoku, a video, an audio --

00:00:54.811 --> 00:00:57.837
it can be anything
that contains hidden information

00:00:57.861 --> 00:01:02.170
that can eventually resolve into an answer
that is a word or a phrase.

00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:03.514
So, to give you an example,

00:01:03.538 --> 00:01:06.156
this is a puzzle called "Master Pieces."

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.021
It consists of 10 images of LEGO people
looking at piles of LEGOs.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.720
And to save us some time,
I'm going to explain what's going on here.

00:01:14.744 --> 00:01:19.149
Each of the piles of LEGOs
is a deconstructed work of art

00:01:19.173 --> 00:01:21.022
in the style of a famous artist.

00:01:21.046 --> 00:01:24.200
So, does anybody recognize
the artist on the left?

00:01:24.641 --> 00:01:26.174
They used a lot of red.

00:01:26.865 --> 00:01:28.265
I heard "Rothko," yeah.

00:01:28.873 --> 00:01:30.024
The second one?

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:31.199
(Audience) Mondrian.

00:01:31.223 --> 00:01:32.785
Alex Rosenthal: Yeah, well done.

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:35.658
And the third one?
This is the hardest one --

00:01:37.404 --> 00:01:38.632
Yeah, Klimt, I heard it.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.171
Well done, the color
is the biggest clue there.

00:01:42.195 --> 00:01:44.860
So the puzzle has various clues

00:01:44.884 --> 00:01:47.133
that tell you what matters
here are the artists,

00:01:47.157 --> 00:01:48.776
not the specific works of art.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.277
And what you need to do
is then look at what you haven't used yet,

00:01:52.301 --> 00:01:55.204
which is the number of LEGO people
in each painting.

00:01:55.228 --> 00:01:56.682
And you can count them

00:01:56.706 --> 00:02:00.736
and then count into the artists'
last names by the same number of letters.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.926
So there's three people
in front of the Rothko on the left,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.609
so you take the third
letter, which is a T.

00:02:06.633 --> 00:02:10.204
There's only one in front of the Mondrian,
so you take the first letter, M.

00:02:10.228 --> 00:02:13.961
And there's three again in front of Klimt,
so you take the third letter, I.

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:16.911
You do that for all 10
of the original artists

00:02:16.935 --> 00:02:18.340
and put them in the order,

00:02:18.364 --> 00:02:21.171
and you get the answer,
which is "illuminate."

00:02:21.195 --> 00:02:23.063
(Laughter)

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.099
Puzzles like this
are about communicating an idea.

00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:30.068
But where I'm trying to be
as clear as possible for you now,

00:02:30.092 --> 00:02:33.665
puzzles have to navigate the line
between abstraction and clarity.

00:02:34.601 --> 00:02:38.465
They have to be obtuse enough
to make you work for it,

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.315
but elegant enough
so you can get to the aha moment,

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:43.212
where everything clicks into place.

00:02:43.546 --> 00:02:45.926
Puzzle solvers are junkies
for this aha moment --

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.328
it feels like a brief high
and an instant of pristine clarity.

00:02:51.077 --> 00:02:54.685
And there's also a deeper
fulfillment at play here,

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.847
which is that humans
are innate problem-solvers.

00:02:57.871 --> 00:03:00.688
That's why we love crosswords
and escape rooms

00:03:00.712 --> 00:03:04.079
and figuring out how to explore
the bottom of the ocean.

00:03:04.704 --> 00:03:09.268
Solving deviously difficult puzzles
expands our minds in new directions,

00:03:09.292 --> 00:03:14.515
and it also helps us come at problems
from diverse perspectives.

00:03:15.927 --> 00:03:18.236
These puzzles come
in various puzzle hunts,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.149
which come in various shapes and sizes.

00:03:20.173 --> 00:03:22.831
There's one-hour ones
designed for novices,

00:03:22.855 --> 00:03:24.577
24-hour road rallies,

00:03:24.601 --> 00:03:28.253
and the puzzle hunt of puzzle hunts,
the MIT Mystery Hunt.

00:03:28.753 --> 00:03:30.920
This is an event
that takes place once a year

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:36.332
and has around 2,000 people
descending on MIT's campus

00:03:36.356 --> 00:03:40.804
and solving puzzles in teams that range
from a single person to over 100.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.547
My team has 60 people on it --

00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:47.491
that includes a national crossword
puzzle tournament champion,

00:03:47.515 --> 00:03:50.188
a particle physicist, a composer,

00:03:50.212 --> 00:03:52.537
an actual deep-sea explorer,

00:03:52.561 --> 00:03:55.926
and me, feeling like
"Mr. Bean goes to Bletchley Park."

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.482
(Laughter)

00:03:58.506 --> 00:04:02.082
That's actually an apt comparison,
because one year involved a puzzle

00:04:02.106 --> 00:04:04.895
where you had to construct
a working Enigma machine

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.556
out of pieces of cardboard.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.762
(Laughter)

00:04:08.786 --> 00:04:10.603
Each Mystery Hunt has a theme.

00:04:10.627 --> 00:04:13.857
Past ones have included "The Matrix"
and "Alice in Wonderland."

00:04:13.881 --> 00:04:17.685
It's often pop culture-
and literary-based themes.

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:20.191
And the goal is to find the coin

00:04:20.215 --> 00:04:23.009
that's been hidden somewhere
on MIT's campus.

00:04:23.033 --> 00:04:26.477
And in order to get there,
you have to solve around 150 puzzles

00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:28.904
and do various events and challenges.

00:04:29.353 --> 00:04:33.067
I had done this for about 10 years
without ever dreaming of winning,

00:04:33.091 --> 00:04:35.416
until January of 2016,

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.752
where 53 hours into a hunt
whose theme is the movie "Inception,"

00:04:39.776 --> 00:04:42.999
we haven't slept in days,
so everything is hilarious ...

00:04:43.023 --> 00:04:44.207
(Laughter)

00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:49.149
The tables are covered in piles of papers,
of our notes and completed puzzles.

00:04:49.173 --> 00:04:53.206
The whiteboards are an unintelligible mess
of three days' worth of insights.

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.340
And we're stuck on two puzzles.

00:04:55.364 --> 00:04:58.490
If we could crack them,
we would get into the endgame,

00:04:58.514 --> 00:05:01.053
and after hours of work,
in a magical moment,

00:05:01.077 --> 00:05:03.656
they both fall within
10 seconds of each other,

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.759
and soon, we're on the final runaround,

00:05:05.783 --> 00:05:08.760
a series of clues
that will lead us to the coin,

00:05:08.784 --> 00:05:11.196
and we're racing through the halls of MIT,

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.542
trying not to knock over
or terrify tour groups,

00:05:14.566 --> 00:05:16.145
when we realize we're not alone,

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.457
there's another team
on the runaround as well,

00:05:18.481 --> 00:05:20.518
and we don't know who's ahead.

00:05:20.542 --> 00:05:23.204
So, we're a mess of anxiety,

00:05:23.228 --> 00:05:26.307
anticipation, exhilaration
and sleep deprivation,

00:05:26.331 --> 00:05:28.585
when we arrive at the Alchemist,

00:05:28.609 --> 00:05:30.903
a sculpture in which we find ...

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.178
this coin.

00:05:33.202 --> 00:05:34.357
(Cheers)

00:05:34.381 --> 00:05:35.533
Yeah.

00:05:35.557 --> 00:05:37.661
(Applause)

00:05:37.685 --> 00:05:40.107
And in claiming it,
we win the MIT Mystery Hunt

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:42.622
by a tiny margin of five minutes.

00:05:43.506 --> 00:05:44.950
What I didn't mention before

00:05:44.974 --> 00:05:46.371
is that the prize for winning

00:05:46.395 --> 00:05:49.609
is that you get to construct
the whole hunt for the following year.

00:05:49.633 --> 00:05:51.371
(Laughter)

00:05:51.395 --> 00:05:52.650
The punishment for winning

00:05:52.674 --> 00:05:57.127
is that you have to construct
the whole hunt for the following year.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.455
At the beginning of 2016,
I had never constructed a puzzle before --

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:03.028
I had solved plenty of puzzles,

00:06:03.052 --> 00:06:06.371
but constructing and solving
are entirely different beasts.

00:06:06.395 --> 00:06:07.577
But once again,

00:06:07.601 --> 00:06:11.101
I was lucky to be on a team full
of brilliant mentors and collaborators.

00:06:11.125 --> 00:06:13.053
So, from a constructor's point of view,

00:06:13.077 --> 00:06:15.553
a puzzle is where I have an idea,

00:06:15.577 --> 00:06:17.427
and instead of telling you what it is,

00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:21.273
I'm going to leave a trail of breadcrumbs
so you can figure it out for yourself,

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:24.029
and have the joy and experience
of the aha moment.

00:06:24.053 --> 00:06:26.855
This is another way of looking
at the aha moment.

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:29.592
And what's incredible to me
is that this experience,

00:06:29.616 --> 00:06:32.519
which is very emotional
and kind of almost physical,

00:06:32.543 --> 00:06:34.670
is something that can be
carefully designed.

00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:36.710
So, to show you what I mean,

00:06:36.734 --> 00:06:40.234
this is a puzzle I co-constructed
with my friend Matt Gruskin.

00:06:40.258 --> 00:06:41.982
It's a text adventure,

00:06:42.006 --> 00:06:44.856
which is the old-school
adventure game format,

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.188
where you're exploring,
going north, east, south and west,

00:06:48.212 --> 00:06:50.625
picking up items and using them.

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:52.831
And you could get
to the end of the game part,

00:06:52.855 --> 00:06:54.657
but you won't have solved the puzzle.

00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:58.776
In order to do so, you have to recognize
a hidden layer of information,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.712
and the easiest way of seeing it
is by mapping the game out.

00:07:01.736 --> 00:07:03.434
That looks something like this.

00:07:03.736 --> 00:07:06.136
Does anybody recognize what this is?

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.759
Yeah, exactly.

00:07:08.783 --> 00:07:12.811
This text adventure takes place
within "Settlers of Catan."

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.179
Who here knows what "Settlers" is?

00:07:15.887 --> 00:07:17.045
Nerds.

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:18.926
(Laughter)

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.061
If you don't know,
"Settlers" is a board game

00:07:21.085 --> 00:07:23.125
where you're competing
against other people

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:26.283
to collect resources
and use them to build structures.

00:07:26.307 --> 00:07:31.149
And within the text adventure,
we hid information in various ways,

00:07:31.173 --> 00:07:33.807
with which you could
reconstruct an entire game.

00:07:33.831 --> 00:07:36.776
You could figure out the roads,
the cities, the towns,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.730
the resources, the numbers on the tiles,
even the dice rolls.

00:07:39.754 --> 00:07:43.011
You put all that information together
and you could extract an answer

00:07:43.035 --> 00:07:45.730
in a way that's too complicated
to explain right now.

00:07:45.754 --> 00:07:47.286
(Laughter)

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.677
But find me afterwards
if you really want to know.

00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:50.735
(Laughter)

00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:52.696
But what this puzzle emphasized for me

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.133
is the value of perspective shifts
in inspiring an aha.

00:07:56.157 --> 00:07:57.323
So, in this puzzle,

00:07:57.347 --> 00:08:00.426
you go from experiencing the world
on the ground, as a character,

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:03.615
to looking down on it from above
as if you're playing a board game,

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:04.926
and in that shift,

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.001
you completely reframe
all the information you've been given.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.583
The hardest part of construction for me
is coming up with a great idea for an aha.

00:08:13.607 --> 00:08:17.432
Fortunately, the world
is a torrent of ideas and information.

00:08:17.456 --> 00:08:21.966
I've seen fantastic puzzles constructed
out of the waggle dances of bees,

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:25.768
and the remarkable coincidence
that the 88 keys of a piano

00:08:25.792 --> 00:08:29.379
can be perfectly mapped
to the 88 constellations in the sky.

00:08:29.403 --> 00:08:32.768
Once you find that out,
you can't not construct the puzzle,

00:08:32.792 --> 00:08:34.982
and it's going to be
about having the solvers

00:08:35.006 --> 00:08:36.966
make that connection in their own minds.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.967
Whether you give them stars on a keyboard

00:08:38.991 --> 00:08:41.053
or play the celestial music of the cosmos,

00:08:41.077 --> 00:08:43.244
you're getting them there,
one way or another.

00:08:43.268 --> 00:08:45.664
Before long, you find yourself
staring at a turtle,

00:08:45.688 --> 00:08:47.871
and asking yourself, "Is this a puzzle?"

00:08:47.895 --> 00:08:49.537
(Laughter)

00:08:49.561 --> 00:08:51.553
And also, staring at a turtle and saying,

00:08:51.577 --> 00:08:55.106
"I never appreciated what multitudes
this contains in its shell alone."

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.656
This might be
a familiar experience to you,

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.434
if you've ever been watching a TED Talk
and asked yourself, "Is this a puzzle?"

00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:02.910
(Laughter)

00:09:02.934 --> 00:09:04.322
I'm not telling.

00:09:04.346 --> 00:09:05.570
But what I will say

00:09:05.594 --> 00:09:09.138
is that puzzles can be found
in the most unexpected of places.

00:09:09.569 --> 00:09:12.490
That brings us back to one
of my favorite puzzles of all time,

00:09:12.514 --> 00:09:14.249
which was constructed by Trip Payne.

00:09:14.273 --> 00:09:17.210
And this time, I'm going to
play it for you with the sound on,

00:09:17.234 --> 00:09:18.823
so get ready to name that tune.

00:09:18.847 --> 00:09:21.109
(Slowed-down mock clucking)

00:09:21.974 --> 00:09:24.537
(Slowed-down mock clucking)

00:09:25.117 --> 00:09:31.452
(Slowed-down mock clucking)

00:09:31.476 --> 00:09:32.626
(Laughter)

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.110
Who knows what that is?

00:09:34.825 --> 00:09:36.999
Yeah, "You Make Me Feel
Like a Natural Woman."

00:09:37.023 --> 00:09:41.851
(Laughter)

00:09:41.875 --> 00:09:45.232
So you can identify that
and seven other songs and clips,

00:09:45.256 --> 00:09:47.803
and then look at the videos
themselves for clues,

00:09:47.827 --> 00:09:51.109
where the way that they are filmed
and edited together

00:09:51.133 --> 00:09:54.196
plus things like the cutaways
to the panel of five people

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:55.474
sitting at a table,

00:09:55.498 --> 00:09:57.950
which is reminiscent of a panel of judges,

00:09:57.974 --> 00:10:01.228
all of this can suggest
"reality competition show."

00:10:01.252 --> 00:10:03.149
And either through internet research,

00:10:03.173 --> 00:10:06.807
or from just recognizing this,
you can get to the aha,

00:10:06.831 --> 00:10:09.871
which is that these clips
are shot-for-shot recreations

00:10:09.895 --> 00:10:12.379
of lip-synch battles
from "RuPaul's Drag Race."

00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:15.299
(Laughter)

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:16.942
So, why do we do this?

00:10:16.966 --> 00:10:19.879
(Laughter)

00:10:19.903 --> 00:10:22.903
(Applause)

00:10:22.927 --> 00:10:24.522
You tell me, I don't know.

00:10:24.546 --> 00:10:27.196
So, first of all, it's really fun.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.672
But I think it also improves
our lives in various ways.

00:10:30.696 --> 00:10:34.157
Being able to solve puzzles,
when I'm confronted with a challenge,

00:10:34.181 --> 00:10:37.332
has allowed me to explore it
from multiple perspectives

00:10:37.356 --> 00:10:39.418
before I lock in an approach.

00:10:39.442 --> 00:10:43.434
Also, the process of solving
is great training for working with a team,

00:10:43.458 --> 00:10:45.942
knowing when to listen, when to share,

00:10:45.966 --> 00:10:48.371
and how to recognize and celebrate insight

00:10:48.395 --> 00:10:52.649
and being able to construct ahas
is a very powerful tool.

00:10:52.673 --> 00:10:57.507
Think of how powerful and exciting
and convincing an idea is

00:10:57.531 --> 00:10:59.697
that comes from your own mind,

00:10:59.721 --> 00:11:02.141
where you make
all the connections yourself.

00:11:03.094 --> 00:11:05.395
So in January of 2017,

00:11:05.419 --> 00:11:09.466
after tens of thousands of hours of work,

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:11.593
we finally run our Mystery Hunt.

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:16.553
And it's a different sort of satisfaction
than the quick high of an aha moment.

00:11:16.577 --> 00:11:21.268
Instead, it's the slow burn of saying
something through perplexing abstraction,

00:11:21.292 --> 00:11:22.692
yet being understood.

00:11:23.085 --> 00:11:24.656
And when it was all over,

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.991
in our exhaustion, we turned to each other
and the world, and we said,

00:11:28.015 --> 00:11:30.434
"We're never doing this again.
It's too much work.

00:11:30.821 --> 00:11:33.385
It's really fun, but no more winning."

00:11:34.109 --> 00:11:37.506
One year later, in January of 2018,

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.515
we won the MIT Mystery Hunt again.

00:11:39.539 --> 00:11:41.221
(Laughter)

00:11:41.245 --> 00:11:45.007
So, we're currently I don't know how many
tens of thousands of hours of work in,

00:11:45.031 --> 00:11:47.434
and we're two months out
from the 2019 Hunt.

00:11:47.458 --> 00:11:50.151
So, thank you for listening,
I have to go write a puzzle.

00:11:50.175 --> 00:11:51.420
(Laughter)

00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:54.087
(Applause)
