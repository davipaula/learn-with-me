00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.515
So, I'll be speaking to you
using language ...

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.610
because I can.

00:00:17.634 --> 00:00:20.787
This is one these magical abilities
that we humans have.

00:00:21.114 --> 00:00:25.066
We can transmit really complicated
thoughts to one another.

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:29.074
So what I'm doing right now is,
I'm making sounds with my mouth

00:00:29.098 --> 00:00:30.313
as I'm exhaling.

00:00:30.337 --> 00:00:32.685
I'm making tones and hisses and puffs,

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:35.719
and those are creating
air vibrations in the air.

00:00:35.743 --> 00:00:38.189
Those air vibrations are traveling to you,

00:00:38.213 --> 00:00:39.998
they're hitting your eardrums,

00:00:40.022 --> 00:00:44.602
and then your brain takes
those vibrations from your eardrums

00:00:44.626 --> 00:00:47.379
and transforms them into thoughts.

00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:49.182
I hope.

00:00:49.206 --> 00:00:50.209
(Laughter)

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:51.390
I hope that's happening.

00:00:51.414 --> 00:00:55.990
So because of this ability,
we humans are able to transmit our ideas

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:58.706
across vast reaches of space and time.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.266
We're able to transmit
knowledge across minds.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.451
I can put a bizarre new idea
in your mind right now.

00:01:06.475 --> 00:01:07.630
I could say,

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:11.575
"Imagine a jellyfish waltzing in a library

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:13.775
while thinking about quantum mechanics."

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.197
(Laughter)

00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:18.249
Now, if everything has gone
relatively well in your life so far,

00:01:18.273 --> 00:01:20.385
you probably haven't had
that thought before.

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:21.411
(Laughter)

00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:23.167
But now I've just made you think it,

00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:24.346
through language.

00:01:24.654 --> 00:01:27.378
Now of course, there isn't just
one language in the world,

00:01:27.402 --> 00:01:30.047
there are about 7,000 languages
spoken around the world.

00:01:30.071 --> 00:01:33.231
And all the languages differ
from one another in all kinds of ways.

00:01:33.255 --> 00:01:36.346
Some languages have different sounds,

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.089
they have different vocabularies,

00:01:38.113 --> 00:01:40.152
and they also have different structures --

00:01:40.176 --> 00:01:42.063
very importantly, different structures.

00:01:42.896 --> 00:01:44.088
That begs the question:

00:01:44.112 --> 00:01:46.724
Does the language we speak
shape the way we think?

00:01:46.748 --> 00:01:48.320
Now, this is an ancient question.

00:01:48.344 --> 00:01:51.515
People have been speculating
about this question forever.

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.856
Charlemagne, Holy Roman emperor, said,

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.916
"To have a second language
is to have a second soul" --

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.443
strong statement
that language crafts reality.

00:01:59.992 --> 00:02:02.982
But on the other hand,
Shakespeare has Juliet say,

00:02:03.006 --> 00:02:04.157
"What's in a name?

00:02:04.181 --> 00:02:06.515
A rose by any other name
would smell as sweet."

00:02:07.504 --> 00:02:10.557
Well, that suggests that maybe
language doesn't craft reality.

00:02:10.926 --> 00:02:14.932
These arguments have gone
back and forth for thousands of years.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.131
But until recently,
there hasn't been any data

00:02:18.155 --> 00:02:19.711
to help us decide either way.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.682
Recently, in my lab
and other labs around the world,

00:02:22.706 --> 00:02:24.098
we've started doing research,

00:02:24.122 --> 00:02:28.559
and now we have actual scientific data
to weigh in on this question.

00:02:28.918 --> 00:02:31.459
So let me tell you about
some of my favorite examples.

00:02:31.846 --> 00:02:35.260
I'll start with an example
from an Aboriginal community in Australia

00:02:35.284 --> 00:02:37.012
that I had the chance to work with.

00:02:37.036 --> 00:02:38.779
These are the Kuuk Thaayorre people.

00:02:38.803 --> 00:02:42.597
They live in Pormpuraaw
at the very west edge of Cape York.

00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:45.587
What's cool about Kuuk Thaayorre is,

00:02:45.611 --> 00:02:48.669
in Kuuk Thaayorre, they don't use
words like "left" and "right,"

00:02:48.693 --> 00:02:51.377
and instead, everything
is in cardinal directions:

00:02:51.401 --> 00:02:52.825
north, south, east and west.

00:02:53.425 --> 00:02:55.960
And when I say everything,
I really mean everything.

00:02:55.984 --> 00:02:57.535
You would say something like,

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:00.071
"Oh, there's an ant
on your southwest leg."

00:03:01.178 --> 00:03:03.834
Or, "Move your cup
to the north-northeast a little bit."

00:03:04.404 --> 00:03:07.884
In fact, the way that you say "hello"
in Kuuk Thaayorre is you say,

00:03:07.908 --> 00:03:09.174
"Which way are you going?"

00:03:09.198 --> 00:03:10.530
And the answer should be,

00:03:11.014 --> 00:03:12.786
"North-northeast in the far distance.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.131
How about you?"

00:03:14.155 --> 00:03:17.287
So imagine as you're walking
around your day,

00:03:17.311 --> 00:03:18.860
every person you greet,

00:03:18.884 --> 00:03:20.955
you have to report your heading direction.

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:22.158
(Laughter)

00:03:22.182 --> 00:03:25.513
But that would actually get you
oriented pretty fast, right?

00:03:25.537 --> 00:03:28.497
Because you literally
couldn't get past "hello,"

00:03:28.521 --> 00:03:30.596
if you didn't know
which way you were going.

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:35.461
In fact, people who speak languages
like this stay oriented really well.

00:03:35.485 --> 00:03:38.410
They stay oriented better
than we used to think humans could.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.692
We used to think that humans
were worse than other creatures

00:03:41.716 --> 00:03:43.432
because of some biological excuse:

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:46.781
"Oh, we don't have magnets
in our beaks or in our scales."

00:03:46.805 --> 00:03:49.747
No; if your language and your culture
trains you to do it,

00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:51.020
actually, you can do it.

00:03:51.044 --> 00:03:54.084
There are humans around the world
who stay oriented really well.

00:03:54.108 --> 00:03:56.236
And just to get us in agreement

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.855
about how different this is
from the way we do it,

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.643
I want you all to close
your eyes for a second

00:04:02.887 --> 00:04:04.240
and point southeast.

00:04:04.264 --> 00:04:05.974
(Laughter)

00:04:05.998 --> 00:04:07.576
Keep your eyes closed. Point.

00:04:10.095 --> 00:04:12.112
OK, so you can open your eyes.

00:04:12.136 --> 00:04:15.915
I see you guys pointing there,
there, there, there, there ...

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:18.407
I don't know which way it is myself --

00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:20.095
(Laughter)

00:04:20.119 --> 00:04:21.777
You have not been a lot of help.

00:04:21.801 --> 00:04:23.118
(Laughter)

00:04:23.142 --> 00:04:26.062
So let's just say the accuracy
in this room was not very high.

00:04:26.086 --> 00:04:29.446
This is a big difference in cognitive
ability across languages, right?

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.865
Where one group -- very
distinguished group like you guys --

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.452
doesn't know which way is which,

00:04:34.476 --> 00:04:35.812
but in another group,

00:04:35.836 --> 00:04:38.126
I could ask a five-year-old
and they would know.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.234
(Laughter)

00:04:39.258 --> 00:04:42.678
There are also really big differences
in how people think about time.

00:04:42.702 --> 00:04:46.719
So here I have pictures
of my grandfather at different ages.

00:04:46.743 --> 00:04:49.970
And if I ask an English speaker
to organize time,

00:04:49.994 --> 00:04:51.479
they might lay it out this way,

00:04:51.503 --> 00:04:52.654
from left to right.

00:04:52.678 --> 00:04:54.509
This has to do with writing direction.

00:04:54.533 --> 00:04:56.559
If you were a speaker of Hebrew or Arabic,

00:04:56.583 --> 00:04:58.873
you might do it going
in the opposite direction,

00:04:58.897 --> 00:05:00.047
from right to left.

00:05:01.578 --> 00:05:03.163
But how would the Kuuk Thaayorre,

00:05:03.187 --> 00:05:05.581
this Aboriginal group I just
told you about, do it?

00:05:05.605 --> 00:05:07.723
They don't use words
like "left" and "right."

00:05:07.747 --> 00:05:09.239
Let me give you hint.

00:05:09.263 --> 00:05:11.814
When we sat people facing south,

00:05:11.838 --> 00:05:13.696
they organized time from left to right.

00:05:14.391 --> 00:05:16.574
When we sat them facing north,

00:05:16.598 --> 00:05:18.573
they organized time from right to left.

00:05:19.026 --> 00:05:21.081
When we sat them facing east,

00:05:21.105 --> 00:05:22.845
time came towards the body.

00:05:23.608 --> 00:05:24.919
What's the pattern?

00:05:26.056 --> 00:05:27.755
East to west, right?

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:31.281
So for them, time doesn't actually
get locked on the body at all,

00:05:31.305 --> 00:05:32.845
it gets locked on the landscape.

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:34.587
So for me, if I'm facing this way,

00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:35.768
then time goes this way,

00:05:35.792 --> 00:05:38.265
and if I'm facing this way,
then time goes this way.

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.289
I'm facing this way, time goes this way --

00:05:40.313 --> 00:05:44.280
very egocentric of me to have
the direction of time chase me around

00:05:44.304 --> 00:05:45.944
every time I turn my body.

00:05:46.598 --> 00:05:49.245
For the Kuuk Thaayorre,
time is locked on the landscape.

00:05:49.269 --> 00:05:52.088
It's a dramatically different way
of thinking about time.

00:05:52.112 --> 00:05:54.023
Here's another really smart human trick.

00:05:54.047 --> 00:05:56.260
Suppose I ask you
how many penguins are there.

00:05:56.958 --> 00:06:00.112
Well, I bet I know how you'd solve
that problem if you solved it.

00:06:00.136 --> 00:06:02.963
You went, "One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight."

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:04.151
You counted them.

00:06:04.175 --> 00:06:05.784
You named each one with a number,

00:06:05.808 --> 00:06:08.444
and the last number you said
was the number of penguins.

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:11.330
This is a little trick
that you're taught to use as kids.

00:06:11.354 --> 00:06:14.405
You learn the number list
and you learn how to apply it.

00:06:14.787 --> 00:06:16.233
A little linguistic trick.

00:06:16.804 --> 00:06:18.481
Well, some languages don't do this,

00:06:18.505 --> 00:06:21.654
because some languages
don't have exact number words.

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:24.936
They're languages that don't have
a word like "seven"

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.361
or a word like "eight."

00:06:27.033 --> 00:06:29.691
In fact, people who speak
these languages don't count,

00:06:29.715 --> 00:06:32.712
and they have trouble
keeping track of exact quantities.

00:06:32.736 --> 00:06:36.665
So, for example, if I ask you
to match this number of penguins

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:38.953
to the same number of ducks,

00:06:38.977 --> 00:06:41.121
you would be able to do that by counting.

00:06:41.145 --> 00:06:45.000
But folks who don't have
that linguistic trick can't do that.

00:06:47.653 --> 00:06:50.807
Languages also differ in how
they divide up the color spectrum --

00:06:50.831 --> 00:06:51.981
the visual world.

00:06:52.348 --> 00:06:54.500
Some languages have
lots of words for colors,

00:06:54.524 --> 00:06:56.888
some have only a couple words,
"light" and "dark."

00:06:56.912 --> 00:07:00.535
And languages differ in where they put
boundaries between colors.

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:03.774
So, for example, in English,
there's a word for blue

00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:06.933
that covers all of the colors
that you can see on the screen,

00:07:06.957 --> 00:07:08.963
but in Russian, there isn't a single word.

00:07:08.987 --> 00:07:11.193
Instead, Russian speakers
have to differentiate

00:07:11.217 --> 00:07:12.688
between light blue, "goluboy,"

00:07:12.712 --> 00:07:14.288
and dark blue, "siniy."

00:07:15.138 --> 00:07:19.121
So Russians have this lifetime
of experience of, in language,

00:07:19.145 --> 00:07:21.014
distinguishing these two colors.

00:07:21.038 --> 00:07:25.001
When we test people's ability
to perceptually discriminate these colors,

00:07:25.025 --> 00:07:27.546
what we find is that
Russian speakers are faster

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.128
across this linguistic boundary.

00:07:29.152 --> 00:07:31.434
They're faster to be able
to tell the difference

00:07:31.458 --> 00:07:32.916
between a light and dark blue.

00:07:33.299 --> 00:07:36.563
And when you look at people's brains
as they're looking at colors --

00:07:36.587 --> 00:07:39.922
say you have colors shifting slowly
from light to dark blue --

00:07:40.798 --> 00:07:45.250
the brains of people who use
different words for light and dark blue

00:07:45.274 --> 00:07:48.784
will give a surprised reaction
as the colors shift from light to dark,

00:07:48.808 --> 00:07:51.990
as if, "Ooh, something
has categorically changed,"

00:07:52.014 --> 00:07:54.460
whereas the brains
of English speakers, for example,

00:07:54.484 --> 00:07:56.624
that don't make
this categorical distinction,

00:07:56.648 --> 00:07:57.844
don't give that surprise,

00:07:57.868 --> 00:07:59.951
because nothing is categorically changing.

00:08:02.054 --> 00:08:04.558
Languages have all kinds
of structural quirks.

00:08:04.582 --> 00:08:05.919
This is one of my favorites.

00:08:05.943 --> 00:08:08.375
Lots of languages have grammatical gender;

00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:13.029
every noun gets assigned a gender,
often masculine or feminine.

00:08:13.053 --> 00:08:15.110
And these genders differ across languages.

00:08:15.134 --> 00:08:19.675
So, for example, the sun is feminine
in German but masculine in Spanish,

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:21.047
and the moon, the reverse.

00:08:21.634 --> 00:08:25.096
Could this actually have any
consequence for how people think?

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.114
Do German speakers think of the sun
as somehow more female-like,

00:08:29.138 --> 00:08:31.044
and the moon somehow more male-like?

00:08:31.767 --> 00:08:33.673
Actually, it turns out that's the case.

00:08:33.697 --> 00:08:39.120
So if you ask German and Spanish speakers
to, say, describe a bridge,

00:08:39.144 --> 00:08:40.580
like the one here --

00:08:40.604 --> 00:08:43.953
"bridge" happens to be grammatically
feminine in German,

00:08:43.977 --> 00:08:46.133
grammatically masculine in Spanish --

00:08:46.157 --> 00:08:50.475
German speakers are more likely
to say bridges are "beautiful," "elegant"

00:08:50.499 --> 00:08:52.626
and stereotypically feminine words.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.159
Whereas Spanish speakers
will be more likely to say

00:08:55.183 --> 00:08:56.729
they're "strong" or "long,"

00:08:56.753 --> 00:08:58.139
these masculine words.

00:09:00.849 --> 00:09:02.529
(Laughter)

00:09:03.396 --> 00:09:07.518
Languages also differ in how
they describe events, right?

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.406
You take an event like this, an accident.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.218
In English, it's fine to say,
"He broke the vase."

00:09:13.869 --> 00:09:16.413
In a language like Spanish,

00:09:16.437 --> 00:09:19.284
you might be more likely
to say, "The vase broke,"

00:09:19.308 --> 00:09:20.869
or, "The vase broke itself."

00:09:21.332 --> 00:09:24.554
If it's an accident, you wouldn't say
that someone did it.

00:09:24.578 --> 00:09:27.984
In English, quite weirdly,
we can even say things like,

00:09:28.008 --> 00:09:29.255
"I broke my arm."

00:09:29.953 --> 00:09:31.787
Now, in lots of languages,

00:09:31.811 --> 00:09:34.982
you couldn't use that construction
unless you are a lunatic

00:09:35.006 --> 00:09:37.135
and you went out
looking to break your arm --

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:38.161
(Laughter)

00:09:38.185 --> 00:09:39.336
and you succeeded.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.624
If it was an accident,
you would use a different construction.

00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:44.453
Now, this has consequences.

00:09:44.477 --> 00:09:48.665
So, people who speak different languages
will pay attention to different things,

00:09:48.689 --> 00:09:52.095
depending on what their language
usually requires them to do.

00:09:52.119 --> 00:09:56.291
So we show the same accident
to English speakers and Spanish speakers,

00:09:56.315 --> 00:09:59.600
English speakers will remember who did it,

00:10:00.525 --> 00:10:03.939
because English requires you
to say, "He did it; he broke the vase."

00:10:03.963 --> 00:10:07.166
Whereas Spanish speakers might be
less likely to remember who did it

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.341
if it's an accident,

00:10:08.365 --> 00:10:11.194
but they're more likely to remember
that it was an accident.

00:10:11.218 --> 00:10:13.654
They're more likely
to remember the intention.

00:10:13.678 --> 00:10:16.761
So, two people watch the same event,

00:10:16.785 --> 00:10:18.866
witness the same crime,

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.936
but end up remembering
different things about that event.

00:10:22.564 --> 00:10:25.823
This has implications, of course,
for eyewitness testimony.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.952
It also has implications
for blame and punishment.

00:10:28.976 --> 00:10:30.783
So if you take English speakers

00:10:30.807 --> 00:10:32.971
and I just show you
someone breaking a vase,

00:10:32.995 --> 00:10:36.850
and I say, "He broke the vase,"
as opposed to "The vase broke,"

00:10:37.504 --> 00:10:39.417
even though you can witness it yourself,

00:10:39.441 --> 00:10:40.709
you can watch the video,

00:10:40.733 --> 00:10:42.895
you can watch the crime against the vase,

00:10:44.157 --> 00:10:45.924
you will punish someone more,

00:10:45.948 --> 00:10:48.801
you will blame someone more
if I just said, "He broke it,"

00:10:48.825 --> 00:10:50.318
as opposed to, "It broke."

00:10:50.931 --> 00:10:54.254
The language guides
our reasoning about events.

00:10:55.996 --> 00:10:58.882
Now, I've given you a few examples

00:10:58.906 --> 00:11:02.633
of how language can profoundly
shape the way we think,

00:11:02.657 --> 00:11:04.832
and it does so in a variety of ways.

00:11:04.856 --> 00:11:06.787
So language can have big effects,

00:11:06.811 --> 00:11:08.553
like we saw with space and time,

00:11:08.577 --> 00:11:10.483
where people can lay out space and time

00:11:10.507 --> 00:11:13.748
in completely different
coordinate frames from each other.

00:11:14.781 --> 00:11:17.015
Language can also have
really deep effects --

00:11:17.039 --> 00:11:19.223
that's what we saw
with the case of number.

00:11:19.572 --> 00:11:21.615
Having count words in your language,

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:22.859
having number words,

00:11:22.883 --> 00:11:25.444
opens up the whole world of mathematics.

00:11:25.468 --> 00:11:27.971
Of course, if you don't count,
you can't do algebra,

00:11:27.995 --> 00:11:29.559
you can't do any of the things

00:11:29.583 --> 00:11:32.326
that would be required
to build a room like this

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:34.354
or make this broadcast, right?

00:11:34.836 --> 00:11:37.699
This little trick of number words
gives you a stepping stone

00:11:37.723 --> 00:11:39.204
into a whole cognitive realm.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:42.715
Language can also have
really early effects,

00:11:42.739 --> 00:11:45.609
what we saw in the case of color.

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:48.699
These are really simple,
basic, perceptual decisions.

00:11:48.723 --> 00:11:51.083
We make thousands of them all the time,

00:11:51.107 --> 00:11:52.924
and yet, language is getting in there

00:11:52.948 --> 00:11:57.279
and fussing even with these tiny little
perceptual decisions that we make.

00:11:58.787 --> 00:12:00.646
Language can have really broad effects.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.898
So the case of grammatical gender
may be a little silly,

00:12:03.922 --> 00:12:07.755
but at the same time,
grammatical gender applies to all nouns.

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:10.350
That means language can shape
how you're thinking

00:12:10.374 --> 00:12:13.261
about anything that can be
named by a noun.

00:12:14.185 --> 00:12:15.514
That's a lot of stuff.

00:12:16.449 --> 00:12:19.706
And finally, I gave you an example
of how language can shape things

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.366
that have personal weight to us --

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:23.966
ideas like blame and punishment
or eyewitness memory.

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.154
These are important things
in our daily lives.

00:12:28.153 --> 00:12:33.154
Now, the beauty of linguistic diversity
is that it reveals to us

00:12:33.178 --> 00:12:37.125
just how ingenious and how flexible
the human mind is.

00:12:37.775 --> 00:12:42.306
Human minds have invented
not one cognitive universe, but 7,000 --

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:44.688
there are 7,000 languages
spoken around the world.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:47.687
And we can create many more --

00:12:47.711 --> 00:12:50.794
languages, of course, are living things,

00:12:50.818 --> 00:12:54.584
things that we can hone
and change to suit our needs.

00:12:55.786 --> 00:12:59.269
The tragic thing is that we're losing
so much of this linguistic diversity

00:12:59.293 --> 00:13:00.444
all the time.

00:13:00.468 --> 00:13:02.360
We're losing about one language a week,

00:13:02.384 --> 00:13:03.850
and by some estimates,

00:13:03.874 --> 00:13:07.141
half of the world's languages
will be gone in the next hundred years.

00:13:07.966 --> 00:13:10.788
And the even worse news is that right now,

00:13:10.812 --> 00:13:14.520
almost everything we know about
the human mind and human brain

00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:19.572
is based on studies of usually American
English-speaking undergraduates

00:13:19.596 --> 00:13:20.920
at universities.

00:13:22.742 --> 00:13:26.275
That excludes almost all humans. Right?

00:13:26.299 --> 00:13:31.270
So what we know about the human mind
is actually incredibly narrow and biased,

00:13:31.294 --> 00:13:34.530
and our science has to do better.

00:13:37.987 --> 00:13:40.246
I want to leave you
with this final thought.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:43.783
I've told you about how speakers
of different languages think differently,

00:13:43.807 --> 00:13:47.091
but of course, that's not about
how people elsewhere think.

00:13:47.115 --> 00:13:48.534
It's about how you think.

00:13:48.558 --> 00:13:52.164
It's how the language that you speak
shapes the way that you think.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.646
And that gives you the opportunity to ask,

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:57.741
"Why do I think the way that I do?"

00:13:57.765 --> 00:13:59.361
"How could I think differently?"

00:13:59.908 --> 00:14:01.273
And also,

00:14:01.297 --> 00:14:03.024
"What thoughts do I wish to create?"

00:14:03.842 --> 00:14:05.001
Thank you very much.

00:14:05.025 --> 00:14:07.781
(Applause)
