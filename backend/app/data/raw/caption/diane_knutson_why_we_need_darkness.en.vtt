00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:10.650
This meadowlark
perches on a prairie flower

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.730
singing its mating song.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.740
It's customary for meadowlarks
to sing toward the rising sun.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.590
This one, however, was mistaken
by the lights of Rapid City at 2 AM.

00:00:24.394 --> 00:00:28.324
Despite being 60 miles south
of the Rapid City border

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.800
and well within the boundaries
of Wind Cave National Park,

00:00:33.275 --> 00:00:38.375
this songbird was singing out
much too late to attract a mate.

00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:44.271
Have you ever tried attracting a mate
by calling them at 2 AM?

00:00:44.271 --> 00:00:46.440
(Laughter)

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.063
My mother told me
nothing good happens after midnight.

00:00:52.063 --> 00:00:53.432
(Laughter)

00:00:53.922 --> 00:00:56.607
So why was this songbird so confused,

00:00:56.607 --> 00:01:01.137
mistaking the bright lights of Rapid City
for the rising sun at 2 AM?

00:01:01.607 --> 00:01:04.247
Improper lighting
and the over-illumination

00:01:04.247 --> 00:01:09.417
of residential neighborhoods,
business signage, and street lights

00:01:09.418 --> 00:01:14.108
brighten our night sky, 
creating an orange hue above the city

00:01:14.108 --> 00:01:16.386
for miles outside its border.

00:01:17.034 --> 00:01:20.246
Over 100 years ago,
all creatures could look up

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:23.496
and see a spectacular starry night sky.

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:27.307
But now, eight out of ten children

00:01:27.307 --> 00:01:30.527
will never see the Milky Way
from where they live.

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:35.117
Light pollution doesn't only impact
our view of the universe,

00:01:35.117 --> 00:01:38.804
it also impacts our environment,
our individual health,

00:01:38.804 --> 00:01:40.494
and energy consumption.

00:01:40.854 --> 00:01:43.004
The three main components
of light pollution

00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:47.263
include sky glow as well as glare
and light trespass,

00:01:47.263 --> 00:01:48.903
which I will also explain.

00:01:50.023 --> 00:01:53.893
Glare is the excessive brightness
that causes us visual discomfort.

00:01:54.334 --> 00:01:58.384
We often illuminate areas
in attempt to increase safety.

00:01:58.778 --> 00:02:02.758
As children, we're afraid of the dark,
so we flip on a night switch

00:02:02.758 --> 00:02:06.420
because "the night
is dark and full of terrors."

00:02:07.232 --> 00:02:11.692
And as adults, we do that now
on a much grander scale.

00:02:11.692 --> 00:02:17.070
A 2015 study published in the Journal
of Epidemiology and Community Health

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.131
looked at statistics
where researchers studied lights

00:02:21.131 --> 00:02:28.101
that were turned on at certain hours,
dimmed, or turned off completely,

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:32.565
and found that it had no impact

00:02:32.895 --> 00:02:36.625
on traffic collisions or crime.

00:02:37.675 --> 00:02:41.195
I want you to take
a very close look at this picture.

00:02:41.575 --> 00:02:43.855
Mentally note what you see.

00:02:49.493 --> 00:02:52.093
With properly shielded lights,

00:02:52.093 --> 00:02:56.405
we can actually see
what was there the entire time.

00:02:56.728 --> 00:02:59.698
Brighter does not mean safer.

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:03.979
The third component
of light pollution is light trespass.

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:06.967
To understand this, I want you
to envision your bedroom.

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:09.991
Could you sleep at night with no curtains?

00:03:10.531 --> 00:03:12.271
Or do you need those blackout shades

00:03:12.277 --> 00:03:15.617
tucked into every single crevice
of that window pane,

00:03:15.617 --> 00:03:18.336
just in order to get a good night's sleep?

00:03:18.856 --> 00:03:21.960
If so, that is because of light trespass,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.660
the shining of light where it's unneeded,
and unintended, and unwanted,

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.478
from another source originating
somewhere other than your own.

00:03:31.784 --> 00:03:35.064
Now that we've looked
at what causes light pollution,

00:03:35.064 --> 00:03:38.131
let's take a look
at where light pollution is.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.440
Here is a global map with light pollution
depicted by various colors.

00:03:45.524 --> 00:03:50.014
Let's zoom in to our local area of impact.

00:03:51.617 --> 00:03:53.917
This is Rapid City.

00:03:54.247 --> 00:04:00.204
We are on the front lines
of a battle of lights versus dark.

00:04:00.721 --> 00:04:04.247
Zooming in closer to South Dakota,
I want you to envision

00:04:04.247 --> 00:04:06.481
that you're downtown
at Main Street Square,

00:04:06.481 --> 00:04:10.011
you've got your blanket, your chair,
you're ready to stargaze.

00:04:10.288 --> 00:04:16.178
And then you look up, and you realize
you can see relatively very few stars.

00:04:16.782 --> 00:04:19.342
You cannot even see the Big Dipper.

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:21.485
So you pack up all your belongings,

00:04:21.485 --> 00:04:23.775
you get in the car,
you drive to the city limits,

00:04:23.775 --> 00:04:27.826
where now you're in the orange zone,
where eight out of ten Americans live,

00:04:27.826 --> 00:04:30.298
and we have a local observatory.

00:04:30.668 --> 00:04:34.358
You look up, you still
cannot see the Milky Way.

00:04:35.603 --> 00:04:39.577
You keep on driving, you go deep
into the Black Hills National Forest,

00:04:40.057 --> 00:04:41.627
and then you see it,

00:04:42.467 --> 00:04:45.747
the sky glow the meadowlark
was singing toward.

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:51.499
To get to a naturally dark sky,
you would have to drive two hours north,

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:56.282
to the corner of northwest South Dakota,
an area called Slim Buttes,

00:04:56.282 --> 00:05:01.075
which has a Class 1 dark sky,
a naturally lit sky,

00:05:01.515 --> 00:05:06.215
where the stars from
the Milky Way shine so bright

00:05:06.521 --> 00:05:09.301
it will cast a shadow of you
on the ground.

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:16.399
Rapid City is a Class 9 sky,
the brightest depicted on the map,

00:05:16.767 --> 00:05:23.317
where light pollution is 100 up to 200
times brighter than our natural darkness.

00:05:23.644 --> 00:05:25.854
You cannot make out the North Star.

00:05:25.854 --> 00:05:28.694
But the thing is Rapid City is not alone.

00:05:29.808 --> 00:05:33.008
Light pollution plagues
every modern city and town.

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:35.894
The good news, however,

00:05:35.894 --> 00:05:41.434
is that light pollution could possibly
be the simplest problem to solve

00:05:41.434 --> 00:05:44.314
and could literally be done overnight,

00:05:44.754 --> 00:05:47.904
simply with the flip of a switch.

00:05:48.574 --> 00:05:51.284
So if at any point in this presentation

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.640
you decide that it's important
to protect our dark skies,

00:05:56.619 --> 00:06:00.351
I ask you to turn off
your light in front of you,

00:06:00.881 --> 00:06:03.381
simply by twisting it off.

00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:09.991
Now just like in real life, here's a hint:

00:06:10.544 --> 00:06:14.724
You can ask your neighbor
to shut off their light as well

00:06:14.724 --> 00:06:17.437
if their light is trespassing
into your area

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:20.649
and inhibiting your view
of a TEDx presentation.

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:22.622
(Laughter)

00:06:22.622 --> 00:06:27.272
Even if we all turn out our lights,
more is needed to be done.

00:06:28.916 --> 00:06:34.436
One hundred years ago, this is the view
from Skyline Drive you would have seen.

00:06:34.438 --> 00:06:41.098
Today, this is a picture taken this year
during the Rapid City Dark Earth Hour.

00:06:41.098 --> 00:06:43.304
Which one do you prefer?

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:48.809
So what are we going to do if we all
turn out our lights and it's still bright?

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:54.312
We need to protect nocturnal habitats,
stargazing opportunities,

00:06:54.312 --> 00:06:57.068
and our nocturnal plants and animals.

00:06:57.318 --> 00:06:58.628
Now, bats.

00:06:58.895 --> 00:07:01.955
There's an idea. I know what we can do.

00:07:02.965 --> 00:07:05.030
Let's call Batman!

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.408
He'll know what to do!

00:07:06.408 --> 00:07:07.958
Send the bat signal!

00:07:08.252 --> 00:07:09.262
Right?

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:12.899
Oh, wait, maybe
he didn't get the memo either.

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:17.309
So let's shift our focus
to nocturnal plants.

00:07:17.568 --> 00:07:21.664
In the Black Hills, there's a moonflower

00:07:21.984 --> 00:07:25.504
that blooms only in dark nights.

00:07:26.764 --> 00:07:28.534
(Music)

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.773
(Music ends)

00:07:45.773 --> 00:07:50.713
Earth evolved with
bright days and dark nights.

00:07:51.066 --> 00:07:57.006
Another example of nocturnal life
that needs darkness is the owl.

00:07:57.559 --> 00:08:02.169
Owls see five times brighter
than we do as humans

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:05.165
because in their eyes
they have light detecting rods

00:08:05.165 --> 00:08:09.775
that are numbered
at one million rods per square millimeter.

00:08:10.246 --> 00:08:15.266
Just because we can see with lights
at night doesn't mean other creatures can.

00:08:15.899 --> 00:08:19.769
But even though we can see
with artificial light at night,

00:08:19.771 --> 00:08:21.891
doesn't mean that it's healthy for us.

00:08:22.432 --> 00:08:29.182
The American Medical Association states
"all creatures need darkness to survive."

00:08:29.182 --> 00:08:31.311
As light travels through our eye,

00:08:31.311 --> 00:08:35.711
it goes to a tract of a nucleus cluster
of thousands of cells

00:08:35.711 --> 00:08:38.061
that send messages to our glands.

00:08:38.341 --> 00:08:42.959
Those glands secrete a naturally occurring
hormone called melatonin.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:47.624
The great thing about melatonin
is it has great antioxidant qualities

00:08:47.624 --> 00:08:51.104
that rid our brain and body
of free radicals

00:08:51.104 --> 00:08:53.931
that cause damage to our brain and body.

00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:57.634
The Journal of Epidemiology Research shows

00:08:57.634 --> 00:09:00.753
that exposure to artificial light at night

00:09:00.753 --> 00:09:04.064
has been linked
to an increase in Alzheimer's,

00:09:04.804 --> 00:09:06.144
breast cancer,

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:07.834
obesity,

00:09:08.074 --> 00:09:09.459
and depression.

00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:13.629
Let's take a look now
at what our future holds.

00:09:14.482 --> 00:09:18.652
The map I showed you of South Dakota
is a one from 1997,

00:09:18.652 --> 00:09:21.617
when in all reality, tonight's dark skies

00:09:21.617 --> 00:09:26.157
is much more closely,
really, like the map of 2025.

00:09:26.157 --> 00:09:31.656
In only eight years, it's estimated
that just eight dark sky places

00:09:31.656 --> 00:09:34.156
will remain in the United States.

00:09:35.295 --> 00:09:39.345
So if we can't call Batman,
what are we supposed to do?

00:09:40.191 --> 00:09:43.641
OK, I have another idea, hold on with me,
this is a little bit better.

00:09:44.101 --> 00:09:47.423
Let's join the Dark Side.

00:09:48.087 --> 00:09:52.057
Maybe Kylo Ren and Darth Vader
had it right all along.

00:09:52.848 --> 00:09:57.098
But all joking aside, there really is
something about the color spectrum.

00:09:57.395 --> 00:10:02.225
This is a color Kelvin chart,
rating color by its temperature.

00:10:02.228 --> 00:10:08.468
The International Dark Sky Association
rates colors below 3,000 Kelvins

00:10:08.468 --> 00:10:10.026
as dark sky friendly

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:13.066
because it doesn't impair night vision.

00:10:14.226 --> 00:10:15.536
What else can we do?

00:10:15.833 --> 00:10:22.423
Address our fixtures, because dark skies
doesn't have to mean dark ground.

00:10:22.699 --> 00:10:26.189
We can point lights down,
where the light is intended.

00:10:26.398 --> 00:10:28.928
The International Dark Sky Association

00:10:28.928 --> 00:10:34.116
estimates that all of the outdoor lighting
wastes 30 percent of light

00:10:34.116 --> 00:10:37.536
that goes outward and upward
where it is not needed or intended,

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:41.830
wasting money and creating
more carbon emissions.

00:10:42.626 --> 00:10:46.346
In addition, this is a sample
of a front porch light

00:10:47.026 --> 00:10:50.076
that could be converted
into a full cutoff fixture,

00:10:50.331 --> 00:10:54.131
reducing glare, sky glow,
and light trespass.

00:10:55.302 --> 00:10:59.682
Streetlights that point light
outward and upward

00:11:00.329 --> 00:11:03.539
could be retrofitted
to point the light downward.

00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:10.511
Paris, the City of Light, took solving
light pollution to a whole new level.

00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:15.558
They enacted a lights-out curfew of 1 AM

00:11:16.837 --> 00:11:21.337
or one hour past the last
employee's departure time.

00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:27.304
I challenge you to find
your reason for #LightsOut.

00:11:27.798 --> 00:11:31.128
I wish you all a very dark night.

00:11:32.068 --> 00:11:33.418
(Applause)
