00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.944
Corey Hajim: Are you there?
Ray Dalio: Hi.

00:00:14.968 --> 00:00:17.048
CH: Thank you so much for being here, Ray.

00:00:17.072 --> 00:00:19.445
RD: Do you see me?
CH: I see you.

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:20.643
You look great.

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:23.723
Thank you so much for being here,
we really appreciate it.

00:00:23.747 --> 00:00:25.168
RD: My pleasure.

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:27.332
CH: OK, so lay it on us, Ray,

00:00:27.356 --> 00:00:30.023
how bad is it, how worried should we be?

00:00:32.126 --> 00:00:35.837
RD: Well, I think you could look at this
like a tsunami that's hit --

00:00:35.861 --> 00:00:38.082
the virus itself
and the social distancing.

00:00:38.106 --> 00:00:42.084
And then what are the consequences
in terms of the wreckage,

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.442
when you look at it?

00:00:44.083 --> 00:00:50.516
And I think you have to think of that
as incomes and balance sheets,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.757
you know?

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.610
So it was a tremendous income hit.

00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:58.510
And then the balance sheets losses.

00:00:58.815 --> 00:01:01.987
And who has what savings and so on.

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.569
And then how is that dealt with.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.102
In order to understand that,

00:01:08.126 --> 00:01:10.950
you have to realize
that there are these holes.

00:01:10.974 --> 00:01:13.188
These holes in income,

00:01:13.212 --> 00:01:15.482
and the holes in the balance sheets.

00:01:15.506 --> 00:01:17.490
And then you have to realize

00:01:17.514 --> 00:01:21.117
that there is the production
of money and credit.

00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:23.966
And who produces that money and credit.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.553
OK, the money and credit
comes in different flavors.

00:01:27.577 --> 00:01:29.977
There is US dollar money and credit.

00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:33.331
There is Euro-dollar money and credit.

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:36.099
And so when you look at the world,

00:01:36.123 --> 00:01:37.346
and you're seeing it,

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.274
you're seeing a situation that is the same

00:01:40.298 --> 00:01:45.092
as existed, really,
in the 1930 to '45 period,

00:01:45.116 --> 00:01:51.128
in that now we're seeing
the production of a lot of debt,

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:53.322
a lot of borrowing by the government.

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:55.133
We're seeing zero interest rates

00:01:55.157 --> 00:01:58.442
and not the traditional
kind of monetary policy.

00:01:58.466 --> 00:02:02.325
But the producing
of a lot of money and credit --

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:06.421
so the Federal Reserve
is buying the Treasury's debt.

00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:12.149
And the Treasury is getting that money
to, mostly, Americans,

00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:16.585
in some imperfect
but remarkably large way.

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:19.481
And the Europeans are doing the same

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:20.759
in their way.

00:02:20.783 --> 00:02:22.942
That bank is a smaller bank,

00:02:22.966 --> 00:02:26.601
because the world lives
with about 70 percent dollars,

00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:28.188
and only a small percent euro,

00:02:28.212 --> 00:02:30.958
and they will produce theirs for theirs,

00:02:30.982 --> 00:02:33.537
and there aren't many banks
around the world.

00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:36.632
And so the rest of the world

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:40.482
is going to have gaps,
holes that won't be filled.

00:02:40.847 --> 00:02:43.926
So if you think about that and you say,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.658
"American printing of money
and the borrowing

00:02:47.682 --> 00:02:50.200
will leave us with a lot of debt
and monetization,"

00:02:50.224 --> 00:02:52.237
that's something interesting
to talk about,

00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:53.889
and we need to talk about that.

00:02:53.913 --> 00:02:55.667
Who will pay these bills,

00:02:55.691 --> 00:02:57.031
and how will that be shared,

00:02:57.055 --> 00:02:58.966
will be something we need to talk about.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.450
But you will know
that you will get that money.

00:03:01.474 --> 00:03:05.306
And the Europeans will get
their versions of that money.

00:03:05.616 --> 00:03:07.974
But we are in a new world.

00:03:07.998 --> 00:03:12.266
And that world is most similar
to the 1930-45 world,

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.341
and a lot of the world
will not get that money in credit.

00:03:15.878 --> 00:03:18.552
So there will be a big differentiation

00:03:18.576 --> 00:03:23.930
as to which entities benefit
and which entities don't.

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:29.670
And there will be a big collaboration
as to how we will deal with that bill

00:03:29.694 --> 00:03:31.615
and who will end up with what.

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.626
A big question of wealth distribution,

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:35.801
and all of that.

00:03:35.825 --> 00:03:39.186
So that's the big thing
that's going to be happening.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.098
CH: How confident are you
that some of that collaboration

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:44.522
can happen right now?

00:03:46.405 --> 00:03:50.000
RD: We're now at one
of those defining moments

00:03:50.024 --> 00:03:51.757
that I've seen repeatedly.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.933
The 1930-45 period,
if you go back in history,

00:03:56.957 --> 00:03:58.824
there's nothing new to this.

00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:01.537
And it's a defining moment

00:04:01.561 --> 00:04:04.494
in terms of how people are
with each other.

00:04:04.885 --> 00:04:06.617
So when you look at it,

00:04:06.641 --> 00:04:09.212
will people come together

00:04:09.236 --> 00:04:12.458
or, when it comes down to it, really,

00:04:12.482 --> 00:04:18.768
will there be a taking care of oneself

00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:21.696
and what does that define,
and how will that go?

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.701
That will be, I think, a defining moment.

00:04:23.725 --> 00:04:25.630
So I look at these histories.

00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:27.752
If I can take a minute,

00:04:27.776 --> 00:04:30.719
I'd like to just paint a template for you

00:04:30.743 --> 00:04:34.720
that takes us, you know,
over the last thousand years,

00:04:34.744 --> 00:04:37.109
the things that have happened
over and over again.

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:39.710
There was one pattern
that I'd like to convey.

00:04:39.734 --> 00:04:41.671
May I take a moment and do that?

00:04:42.006 --> 00:04:43.156
CH: Absolutely.

00:04:44.815 --> 00:04:51.387
RD: There are four things
that are the driving forces

00:04:51.411 --> 00:04:54.662
of our economy
and our lifestyle and wealth.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.390
And the first and most powerful
is productivity,

00:04:59.414 --> 00:05:03.293
which comes from people
learning and inventing

00:05:03.317 --> 00:05:06.568
and doing things well,
just as Marko [Russiver] described.

00:05:07.315 --> 00:05:08.466
OK?

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.371
And it grows slowly.

00:05:10.395 --> 00:05:12.934
You know, one or two
or three percent a year.

00:05:12.958 --> 00:05:14.109
It grows slowly,

00:05:14.133 --> 00:05:16.824
and it's not volatile,
because knowledge isn't volatile.

00:05:16.848 --> 00:05:17.999
But it grows,

00:05:18.023 --> 00:05:20.800
and that raises our living standards
over a period of time.

00:05:20.824 --> 00:05:23.013
Then there's the short-term debt cycle.

00:05:23.037 --> 00:05:26.259
The short-term debt cycle
is, you know, recessions and expansions

00:05:26.283 --> 00:05:27.996
and booms and recessions -- that.

00:05:28.466 --> 00:05:30.759
They last about eight, ten years.

00:05:30.783 --> 00:05:33.609
And then there's a long-term debt cycle.

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:35.434
And that long-term debt cycle,

00:05:35.458 --> 00:05:40.305
which goes on about once
every 50 to 75 years,

00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:44.509
is when you begin a new type of money
and a new type of credit.

00:05:44.956 --> 00:05:47.480
That began in 1945.

00:05:47.504 --> 00:05:52.035
The new world order
at the end of World War II,

00:05:52.059 --> 00:05:54.584
and with the Bretton Woods
monetary system,

00:05:54.608 --> 00:05:59.123
created a new monetary system
in 1945, a new money.

00:05:59.147 --> 00:06:01.522
So they wiped out,
pretty much, the old money,

00:06:01.546 --> 00:06:03.315
or they largely disposed of it,

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:04.664
and they began anew.

00:06:04.688 --> 00:06:06.196
And that's the new world order,

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.268
which was the American world order,

00:06:08.292 --> 00:06:09.560
and we have seen it,

00:06:09.584 --> 00:06:14.149
and still, 70 percent of the money
and credit that exists in the economy

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:15.910
is running by dollars,

00:06:15.934 --> 00:06:18.910
and what you have, traditionally,
is the breakdown.

00:06:18.934 --> 00:06:21.723
And then the fourth influence is politics.

00:06:22.231 --> 00:06:26.008
And politics is largely
how we deal with each other.

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:30.144
And there's internal politics,
and there's external politics.

00:06:30.684 --> 00:06:36.132
The internal politics
is, how do you deal with the wealth gap?

00:06:36.712 --> 00:06:39.112
How do you deal with the values gap?

00:06:39.572 --> 00:06:41.974
Do you have a common mission?

00:06:41.998 --> 00:06:45.163
Do we have an American dream
that we can agree on

00:06:45.187 --> 00:06:47.807
and that we're pursuing that together,

00:06:47.831 --> 00:06:51.902
or do you fight over wealth, and so on.

00:06:51.926 --> 00:06:53.903
And so when you look at history,

00:06:53.927 --> 00:06:56.846
that's what revolutions are
in their various ways.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.679
And there's always a revolution
in one of these.

00:06:59.703 --> 00:07:01.814
Sometimes those are peaceful revolutions

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:05.307
and sometimes they are disruptive.

00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:10.354
But it's a wealth shift
that needs to take place.

00:07:10.378 --> 00:07:15.224
Roosevelt shifted policies
and changed taxes and so on in that way.

00:07:15.248 --> 00:07:16.950
And then in other countries,

00:07:16.974 --> 00:07:20.093
there was the turning over democracy.

00:07:20.117 --> 00:07:22.895
Hitler came to power because of that gap.

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:25.879
So how people deal
with each other internally.

00:07:25.903 --> 00:07:28.014
There's also external politics,

00:07:28.038 --> 00:07:31.513
so that politics means between countries.

00:07:31.863 --> 00:07:34.696
And you have a situation
when there's a rising power

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.632
challenging existing power.

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:40.078
There is competition,
and there is a risk of war.

00:07:40.638 --> 00:07:43.232
And so how they deal with each other.

00:07:43.566 --> 00:07:45.669
Whether there's a greater good,

00:07:45.693 --> 00:07:50.026
or whether they are fighting
with each other

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:51.584
is the defining moment.

00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:54.128
There are always stress tests,

00:07:54.152 --> 00:07:59.215
these big stress tests
that come along once every 75 years.

00:07:59.239 --> 00:08:00.565
And when they happen --

00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:02.244
And this is a stress test.

00:08:02.268 --> 00:08:07.989
And I think that what you're going to see
is how we deal with each other.

00:08:08.013 --> 00:08:09.768
There's enough wealth to go around.

00:08:09.792 --> 00:08:13.855
But what do you do
when you're outside the ring of support?

00:08:13.879 --> 00:08:15.886
Let's say of the US dollar.

00:08:16.315 --> 00:08:18.799
And what is that going to be like
for those entities?

00:08:18.823 --> 00:08:23.759
Or if you're within the ring of support,
how will that bill be divided?

00:08:24.131 --> 00:08:25.847
And how will we be with each other?

00:08:25.871 --> 00:08:28.315
I think we're going to have to reconsider

00:08:28.339 --> 00:08:30.014
who has what,

00:08:30.038 --> 00:08:32.339
what is it about education, and so on.

00:08:32.363 --> 00:08:34.563
So that's what we're in, I think.

00:08:35.077 --> 00:08:37.228
CH: And I want to get to --

00:08:37.252 --> 00:08:40.895
because you've written extensively
about how capitalism needs to change,

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.093
and some of the things

00:08:42.117 --> 00:08:44.241
that we should be
thinking about and doing,

00:08:44.265 --> 00:08:47.887
and I want to definitely
get to that a little bit later on,

00:08:47.911 --> 00:08:51.339
but I am curious right now,
just from a practical level,

00:08:51.363 --> 00:08:55.672
do you think that we're headed
into a global depression?

00:08:58.398 --> 00:09:02.437
RD: Yes, but I want to be careful
about what I use -- the word.

00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:03.612
CH: Absolutely.

00:09:03.636 --> 00:09:05.731
RD: To be technical.

00:09:05.755 --> 00:09:07.977
The word is an evocative word.

00:09:08.315 --> 00:09:10.680
And it can be scary and so on.

00:09:10.704 --> 00:09:13.569
So what do you mean by a "depression," OK?

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:16.966
Something like happened in the 1930s,

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.172
so just to repeat:

00:09:18.196 --> 00:09:23.947
1929 to 1932, there was a fall
in the economy.

00:09:24.311 --> 00:09:27.255
And double-digit unemployment rates.

00:09:27.675 --> 00:09:31.394
And a magnitude of fall in the economy,
like, about 10 percent.

00:09:31.858 --> 00:09:33.334
Do I think we're in that?

00:09:33.358 --> 00:09:34.521
Yes.

00:09:34.545 --> 00:09:38.307
How was that dealt with, 1933?

00:09:38.331 --> 00:09:40.593
What they did is they printed
a lot of money.

00:09:40.974 --> 00:09:44.339
And the government came out
with the same type of programs

00:09:44.363 --> 00:09:45.974
that we're having now.

00:09:45.998 --> 00:09:48.164
Yes, OK, same thing.

00:09:48.188 --> 00:09:50.093
Interest rates hit zero.

00:09:50.117 --> 00:09:52.458
Same thing, OK, same dynamics.

00:09:52.863 --> 00:09:54.322
And then, there is --

00:09:54.346 --> 00:09:58.649
That money causes an expansion
from that point.

00:09:58.673 --> 00:10:01.276
How long does it take for the stock market

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.760
to exceed its highs?

00:10:03.784 --> 00:10:08.084
Or how long does it take for the economy
to exceed its former highs?

00:10:08.402 --> 00:10:09.552
A long time.

00:10:09.863 --> 00:10:11.014
OK.

00:10:11.038 --> 00:10:12.585
Do I think that's what we're in?

00:10:12.609 --> 00:10:13.865
Yes, that's what we're in.

00:10:13.889 --> 00:10:16.762
We've seen that happen
repeatedly in history.

00:10:17.223 --> 00:10:20.485
Saw it many, many times;
it's just the most recent one.

00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:22.072
And there's a structure to that.

00:10:22.096 --> 00:10:24.805
So yes, this is not a recession.

00:10:25.163 --> 00:10:26.553
This is a breakdown,

00:10:26.577 --> 00:10:31.156
an operation that I'm just describing
in terms of how it's dealt with,

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.600
the production of money
and credit and all of that.

00:10:33.624 --> 00:10:35.024
That's what we're in.

00:10:35.664 --> 00:10:37.244
CH: And so you've talked about,

00:10:37.268 --> 00:10:42.164
there are sort of four levers
to recovery after a depression:

00:10:42.188 --> 00:10:45.188
cutting spending, also known as austerity;

00:10:45.212 --> 00:10:47.389
debt restructuring, or forgiveness;

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:51.168
redistribution of wealth
through taxes, potentially;

00:10:51.192 --> 00:10:52.685
and printing of money,

00:10:52.709 --> 00:10:54.756
some of these things you've mentioned.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.479
Will those things get us
out of this situation,

00:10:57.503 --> 00:11:01.025
since, as you feel, it's happened before?

00:11:01.049 --> 00:11:05.204
But how would you think
about balancing these tools right now?

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.190
RD: Yeah, those are the tools
since eternity, basically,

00:11:11.214 --> 00:11:12.744
since recorded history.

00:11:12.768 --> 00:11:14.410
Those are the ones that operated,

00:11:14.434 --> 00:11:20.047
and I think what you're going to see
is a combination you're seeing,

00:11:20.071 --> 00:11:24.635
of printing money and redistribution.

00:11:25.403 --> 00:11:27.418
And I think it will last ...

00:11:27.911 --> 00:11:31.045
These things happen pretty quickly,

00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:36.582
they last maybe a couple or three years
in terms of that process.

00:11:36.899 --> 00:11:39.121
And then you have a rebuilding.

00:11:39.145 --> 00:11:43.246
And they're dealt with with creativity.

00:11:43.553 --> 00:11:48.593
The greatest force, through time,

00:11:48.617 --> 00:11:52.450
is inventiveness, human inventiveness,

00:11:52.474 --> 00:11:53.918
adaptability.

00:11:54.268 --> 00:11:57.625
So you're going to see
these restructurings happen,

00:11:57.649 --> 00:12:00.197
and you're going to see
the kind of inventiveness

00:12:00.221 --> 00:12:02.950
that you just saw from Marko, OK?

00:12:02.974 --> 00:12:07.591
And it's the power of that adaptation
that is the greatest power.

00:12:07.615 --> 00:12:09.072
I did a study,

00:12:09.096 --> 00:12:11.428
which is on LinkedIn
if anyone wants to see it,

00:12:11.452 --> 00:12:14.853
and it goes back 500 years.

00:12:15.244 --> 00:12:19.545
And it shows real GDP.

00:12:19.569 --> 00:12:20.735
In other words,

00:12:20.759 --> 00:12:23.609
the economic activity going back there.

00:12:23.633 --> 00:12:24.848
And there's a line.

00:12:24.872 --> 00:12:29.562
And you don't see these depressions,
as we're calling them,

00:12:29.586 --> 00:12:31.847
even on that line that barely wiggles.

00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:36.079
When you go into it
and you look at that piece,

00:12:36.103 --> 00:12:37.358
that's what it looks like.

00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:40.025
GDP falls 10 percent,
unemployment goes up,

00:12:40.049 --> 00:12:41.450
and it passes.

00:12:41.752 --> 00:12:46.560
And because the greatest force
is the force of adaptation

00:12:46.584 --> 00:12:47.743
and inventiveness,

00:12:47.767 --> 00:12:49.806
if we can operate well together.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.251
So that's what I think
it's going to look like

00:12:52.275 --> 00:12:53.481
over this period of time.

00:12:53.505 --> 00:12:54.751
It will pass,

00:12:54.775 --> 00:12:56.473
the world will be very different,

00:12:56.497 --> 00:12:58.406
there will be a new world order,

00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:59.809
but it will pass,

00:12:59.833 --> 00:13:01.147
and we'll be inventive,

00:13:01.171 --> 00:13:05.136
because what we're dealing with now
is just money and credit.

00:13:05.478 --> 00:13:07.771
Money and credit is just digital.

00:13:07.795 --> 00:13:09.402
I mean, there's no --

00:13:09.426 --> 00:13:12.788
There is real good services,
you know, those are real.

00:13:13.267 --> 00:13:15.726
But everything else is just accounting.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.774
And so when you change the digits,

00:13:17.798 --> 00:13:19.376
and you work those things out,

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.868
and you work yourself through,

00:13:20.892 --> 00:13:24.480
that takes, you know,
a couple of years at most, kind of.

00:13:24.504 --> 00:13:27.604
And then you come back
into a restructured environment.

00:13:27.964 --> 00:13:32.488
And it could be said that it is really
healthy in many ways.

00:13:32.512 --> 00:13:34.575
Because it is a stress test.

00:13:34.599 --> 00:13:37.815
Because if you look at history,
people have gotten --

00:13:37.839 --> 00:13:39.403
sometimes they get weaker,

00:13:39.427 --> 00:13:42.156
or they're not prepared in many ways.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.076
Weaker in terms of,

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.959
maybe they don't build enough savings
and they operate that,

00:13:46.983 --> 00:13:49.799
or maybe they emphasize luxuries
over necessities.

00:13:49.823 --> 00:13:53.381
It's a reorienting type of experience

00:13:53.405 --> 00:13:55.397
that, in many ways, makes us healthy.

00:13:55.421 --> 00:13:57.984
Even appreciating the basics of life.

00:13:59.913 --> 00:14:01.932
Chris Anderson: Ray, just popping in here

00:14:01.956 --> 00:14:04.385
with a couple of questions
from our online audience.

00:14:04.409 --> 00:14:06.058
I mean, the main question early on

00:14:06.082 --> 00:14:10.975
was just, how difficult do you think
the days ahead are for the economy.

00:14:10.999 --> 00:14:13.403
And you've answered that very vigorously.

00:14:13.427 --> 00:14:16.727
Like, using that word, "depression,"

00:14:16.751 --> 00:14:19.019
that's a very strong word.

00:14:19.648 --> 00:14:21.128
Tell me if I have this right --

00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:23.450
it feels to me like
what you just said there

00:14:23.474 --> 00:14:28.362
is stronger than most people
in the market seem to believe.

00:14:28.386 --> 00:14:31.552
The market is behaving as if,

00:14:31.576 --> 00:14:33.560
you know, we've had the bad news,

00:14:33.584 --> 00:14:35.617
and it sort of, kind of wants to come back

00:14:35.641 --> 00:14:38.871
and a lot of people seem to think
that within, I don't know, a year,

00:14:38.895 --> 00:14:41.164
we'll kind of be back where we are.

00:14:41.188 --> 00:14:43.292
You're saying, no,
it's going to take longer.

00:14:43.316 --> 00:14:46.291
Does that imply that there is basically

00:14:46.315 --> 00:14:50.569
sort of some systemic shots
that the market hasn't yet fully seen,

00:14:50.593 --> 00:14:54.823
perhaps to do with the inability
of some players to handle

00:14:54.847 --> 00:14:57.958
the extreme levels of debt
that are piling up right now,

00:14:57.982 --> 00:14:59.382
as people can't work?

00:15:02.702 --> 00:15:08.283
RD: Yeah, I can't speak
for what everybody's thinking out there,

00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:10.394
you know, the markets are off,

00:15:10.418 --> 00:15:13.641
depending on what market
and depending on what country you're in,

00:15:13.665 --> 00:15:18.660
you know, something in the vicinity
of 25 to 45 or 50 percent,

00:15:18.684 --> 00:15:20.970
depending what currency you're managing.

00:15:20.994 --> 00:15:24.200
And so if you're talking
about emerging markets,

00:15:24.224 --> 00:15:25.374
they're worse,

00:15:25.398 --> 00:15:27.835
because they're not going to get
as much, and so on.

00:15:27.859 --> 00:15:31.109
I can describe what I see, OK?

00:15:31.133 --> 00:15:36.875
We see something like
20 trillion dollars of losses.

00:15:37.789 --> 00:15:41.042
OK, we see --

00:15:41.066 --> 00:15:45.487
If you work that through,
and you say you don't have money,

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:47.073
and you don't have credit,

00:15:47.097 --> 00:15:48.631
your business can fail.

00:15:49.581 --> 00:15:51.867
You know this, we see this all around us.

00:15:51.891 --> 00:15:55.985
So there can be failures
when there can't be payments.

00:15:56.391 --> 00:15:59.252
And so the question is,
who gets what check

00:15:59.276 --> 00:16:01.485
to make those payments and get past it,

00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:06.691
but we're going to have
a giant restructuring of the IOUs

00:16:06.715 --> 00:16:08.080
and we're going to work out.

00:16:08.104 --> 00:16:11.900
When hospitals can go broke --

00:16:11.924 --> 00:16:14.972
because this is terribly
costly for hospitals,

00:16:14.996 --> 00:16:19.225
and they will not fully
recover their losses,

00:16:19.249 --> 00:16:20.641
hospitals will go broke,

00:16:20.665 --> 00:16:22.593
even though we know that they need them.

00:16:22.617 --> 00:16:25.601
So you have to go entity by entity

00:16:25.625 --> 00:16:26.785
through this.

00:16:26.809 --> 00:16:29.387
And then you'll go through
the process of who will pay.

00:16:29.411 --> 00:16:31.339
So this is not --

00:16:31.363 --> 00:16:34.139
You know, some people mistake this as --

00:16:34.163 --> 00:16:39.333
There is a virus,
and the virus may come and go, OK?

00:16:39.357 --> 00:16:40.712
Maybe we never see it again.

00:16:40.736 --> 00:16:42.117
I don't think that's likely,

00:16:42.141 --> 00:16:45.315
but people tell me, but who knows.

00:16:45.339 --> 00:16:48.283
But if it never came back again,

00:16:48.307 --> 00:16:53.037
there will be those who are broke
and who will have loss of income.

00:16:53.061 --> 00:16:56.180
We're going to change
how we operate, in a way.

00:16:56.204 --> 00:16:58.597
The supply lines are going to change.

00:16:58.621 --> 00:17:00.820
In other words, self-sufficiency.

00:17:00.844 --> 00:17:03.867
What is self-sufficiency
now going to mean?

00:17:03.891 --> 00:17:05.582
Do we have enough of this and that?

00:17:05.606 --> 00:17:07.680
We're going to restructure our economy.

00:17:07.704 --> 00:17:10.068
And restructure the financial system

00:17:10.092 --> 00:17:11.911
in ways that mean

00:17:11.935 --> 00:17:15.496
we are not going to go back
to the way it was.

00:17:16.173 --> 00:17:19.410
CA: So do you see systemic threats
to the financial industry

00:17:19.434 --> 00:17:22.434
as great or greater than happened in 2008?

00:17:23.736 --> 00:17:26.950
RD: Yeah, this is bigger
than what happened in 2008.

00:17:26.974 --> 00:17:28.181
I'll distinguish it.

00:17:28.205 --> 00:17:32.029
In 2008, we had banks.

00:17:32.688 --> 00:17:34.125
It's the same thing, meaning,

00:17:34.149 --> 00:17:35.982
you have a certain amount of leverage,

00:17:36.006 --> 00:17:37.609
things go down,

00:17:37.633 --> 00:17:41.442
too much leverage means you're broke,
in accounting terms.

00:17:41.466 --> 00:17:43.744
So then you look around and you say,

00:17:43.768 --> 00:17:47.911
who are the systemically important
entities that you don't want to go broke?

00:17:47.935 --> 00:17:51.135
Because, do you want to lose
those banks at this time?

00:17:51.159 --> 00:17:54.611
And then you can make up money
and make up credit

00:17:54.635 --> 00:17:58.032
and you can keep them alive in some way,

00:17:58.056 --> 00:17:59.318
and you did it with banks,

00:17:59.342 --> 00:18:01.736
and through the banks,
there were the mortgages,

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.244
and that's what it looked like.

00:18:03.268 --> 00:18:05.014
This is more complex than that,

00:18:05.038 --> 00:18:06.751
because there are the banks,

00:18:06.775 --> 00:18:10.323
and then there are those,
all of those that are beyond banks.

00:18:10.347 --> 00:18:12.522
All the little businesses,

00:18:12.546 --> 00:18:16.276
all of those in all the different
places that are beyond it.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.220
And it's a bigger crisis.

00:18:18.522 --> 00:18:22.252
And we have a less effective
monetary policy,

00:18:22.276 --> 00:18:25.712
because interest rates declines
have reached their limit.

00:18:25.736 --> 00:18:29.307
And just buying financial assets
by the central bank

00:18:29.331 --> 00:18:32.269
and buying the normal
financial assets won't work.

00:18:32.293 --> 00:18:35.031
They have to buy the debt
of the government

00:18:35.055 --> 00:18:37.856
and the government,
or the many governments,

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:42.479
have to be effective in getting
buying power and production

00:18:42.503 --> 00:18:45.036
to those who need it around the world.

00:18:47.069 --> 00:18:48.451
CA: I have one last question,

00:18:48.475 --> 00:18:50.985
and then I'll be back
at the end of the hour, Corey,

00:18:51.009 --> 00:18:52.267
and it's back to you.

00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:53.838
So, given how bleak that is,

00:18:53.862 --> 00:18:58.456
people are asking, what kinds
of industries, organizations, companies

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.758
have the best prospects
of thriving, going forward?

00:19:03.076 --> 00:19:06.760
RD: Well, you see,
that's the beauty of it.

00:19:07.929 --> 00:19:09.996
There are two types, basically.

00:19:10.326 --> 00:19:15.675
There are those that are stable,
meat-and-potatoes,

00:19:15.699 --> 00:19:18.156
not-leverage kind of companies,

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:21.410
you know, the Campbell soup equivalent,

00:19:21.434 --> 00:19:24.712
you know, everybody's going to use them
all the time, kind of thing.

00:19:24.736 --> 00:19:27.709
And then, there are the innovators.

00:19:28.137 --> 00:19:32.092
The innovators like,
we're talking about Marko.

00:19:32.116 --> 00:19:33.544
You had Marko on before.

00:19:33.994 --> 00:19:36.105
And that new innovation,

00:19:36.129 --> 00:19:39.756
those who can adapt well
and innovate well,

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.085
and don't have balance sheet problems,

00:19:43.109 --> 00:19:45.307
in other words,
they have strong balance sheets

00:19:45.331 --> 00:19:48.522
so they're going to be able
to play the game without having that.

00:19:48.546 --> 00:19:50.339
They will be great winners.

00:19:50.363 --> 00:19:52.966
And so there's always new inventions,

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.720
new creativity,

00:19:54.744 --> 00:19:57.228
that is the new adaptation

00:19:57.252 --> 00:20:00.442
that becomes a company
and an entrepreneur.

00:20:00.466 --> 00:20:02.133
And they're going to do great,

00:20:02.157 --> 00:20:04.720
plus the stuff that we're
always going to need.

00:20:04.744 --> 00:20:07.291
Those are the things
that are going to do great.

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:09.887
CA: Thank you, Ray.

00:20:09.911 --> 00:20:11.079
Corey.

00:20:11.103 --> 00:20:12.477
CH: Thank you, Chris.

00:20:14.077 --> 00:20:18.966
So I guess I'd like to stay
with the market for a minute.

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.688
Obviously, it's something
that interests so many people.

00:20:21.712 --> 00:20:24.678
The state of the market
doesn't always correlate

00:20:24.702 --> 00:20:27.997
with what's going on in the economy.

00:20:28.021 --> 00:20:31.865
And the market and its players
have changed so much

00:20:31.889 --> 00:20:34.695
over the past, you know, 70 years or so,

00:20:34.719 --> 00:20:36.806
70, 90 years.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:41.553
So many more algorithms,
and machines and passive investing.

00:20:41.577 --> 00:20:47.069
And how do you think that affects
how the market is behaving right now,

00:20:47.093 --> 00:20:52.179
how it's going to recover
over the next, you know, few years,

00:20:52.203 --> 00:20:54.218
as the economy recovers?

00:20:57.393 --> 00:21:01.029
RD: The basic fundamentals

00:21:01.053 --> 00:21:06.609
of money credit crisis,

00:21:06.633 --> 00:21:09.164
who has what income,

00:21:09.188 --> 00:21:10.363
who has what expenses,

00:21:10.387 --> 00:21:12.649
who has what balance sheet,

00:21:12.673 --> 00:21:15.379
and how do we deal
with money and credit --

00:21:15.403 --> 00:21:18.850
those things, which people
often lose sight of,

00:21:18.874 --> 00:21:21.977
because they happen only once
in one's lifetime.

00:21:22.001 --> 00:21:27.449
This period, you have to go back
to the 1930s as the last period.

00:21:27.473 --> 00:21:30.458
Those fundamentals of what a bank is,

00:21:30.482 --> 00:21:33.448
and the associated process,

00:21:33.472 --> 00:21:35.761
have existed all through time.

00:21:36.411 --> 00:21:41.126
Then it's, like, technology changes.

00:21:41.442 --> 00:21:43.307
Technology evolves.

00:21:43.712 --> 00:21:50.276
And so the capacity to take one's thinking
and to put them in algorithms --

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.093
we've been doing this for 25 years.

00:21:53.117 --> 00:21:56.727
The way we operate is to take a principle,

00:21:56.751 --> 00:21:59.014
"How would I deal with that situation,"

00:21:59.038 --> 00:22:01.783
and write it down,
put it into an algorithm,

00:22:01.807 --> 00:22:08.303
and then, because the capacity to think
has been radically enhanced,

00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:12.263
because the human mind
has a capacity problem.

00:22:12.287 --> 00:22:14.628
It's unique in inventing.

00:22:14.998 --> 00:22:19.077
But it can only process
so much in so [much] time.

00:22:19.101 --> 00:22:23.355
So when worked in partnership
with the computer,

00:22:23.379 --> 00:22:26.633
which has the capacity
to take that thinking

00:22:26.657 --> 00:22:30.260
and replicate it and do
all of that leverage thinking,

00:22:30.284 --> 00:22:32.440
and thinking in advanced way,

00:22:32.464 --> 00:22:35.013
that is the advancement of our time.

00:22:35.037 --> 00:22:36.490
And so you're seeing that.

00:22:36.514 --> 00:22:39.420
So when you think algorithmic,

00:22:39.444 --> 00:22:42.442
you know, you've got
to break it down as to what it is.

00:22:42.466 --> 00:22:47.158
Is it sensible cause-effect relationships
that are being dealt with?

00:22:48.212 --> 00:22:51.855
It all comes back
to "Do you have understanding,

00:22:51.879 --> 00:22:57.227
and are you successfully betting
on a cause-effect relationship?"

00:22:57.251 --> 00:23:01.038
Because that's the only way
you're going to make money.

00:23:01.062 --> 00:23:04.712
But the computer can do it,
process that thing,

00:23:04.736 --> 00:23:06.522
in a much more advanced way.

00:23:06.546 --> 00:23:08.584
So that's what's going on.

00:23:08.608 --> 00:23:09.770
There will be people

00:23:09.794 --> 00:23:13.670
who will make the mistake
of just applying machine learning

00:23:13.694 --> 00:23:14.918
to the markets.

00:23:14.942 --> 00:23:19.894
And that generally won't work
because of certain things.

00:23:19.918 --> 00:23:22.910
I guess I should explain,
because you asked, so ...

00:23:23.649 --> 00:23:27.307
On algorithmic decision-making,

00:23:27.331 --> 00:23:30.053
there are two ways
you can get your algorithm.

00:23:30.077 --> 00:23:34.428
You can specify the instruction
to the computer and have it follow that

00:23:34.452 --> 00:23:36.781
and that will enable your thinking.

00:23:37.165 --> 00:23:42.002
Or you can have the algorithm
come from putting a lot of data

00:23:42.026 --> 00:23:43.496
into the computer,

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.869
and asking, "Computer, what would you do,
and what's your algorithm?"

00:23:47.893 --> 00:23:49.900
The key difference between those

00:23:49.924 --> 00:23:55.609
is do you have understanding
of the cause-effect relationships?

00:23:56.022 --> 00:23:59.348
You must have understanding
of the cause-effect relationships

00:23:59.372 --> 00:24:01.348
to know what to believe in.

00:24:01.372 --> 00:24:04.173
Because you can't always
get that in your sample size.

00:24:04.197 --> 00:24:06.292
For example, what's happening now,

00:24:06.316 --> 00:24:09.498
you could not have run your computer

00:24:09.522 --> 00:24:11.633
and have it in your sample size,

00:24:11.657 --> 00:24:14.296
because you would have
to go back to the 1930s

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.212
to have an analogous period.

00:24:16.236 --> 00:24:18.418
So what you --

00:24:18.442 --> 00:24:19.689
It is how you do that,

00:24:19.713 --> 00:24:23.521
but the capacity to learn, to invent,

00:24:23.545 --> 00:24:27.355
and to get, you know,
that leverage in decision-making,

00:24:27.379 --> 00:24:29.204
is greater than ever before.

00:24:29.228 --> 00:24:31.466
And that's the power of our time.

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:34.259
Some will do it well,
some will do it poorly,

00:24:34.283 --> 00:24:37.704
but it really comes down
to do you have the understanding

00:24:37.728 --> 00:24:40.164
of those cause-effect relationships,

00:24:40.188 --> 00:24:42.823
so that you know
how to place the right bet.

00:24:43.371 --> 00:24:47.434
CH: But that's very different
from the passive investment market,

00:24:47.458 --> 00:24:49.700
which is such a huge part of it now,

00:24:49.724 --> 00:24:52.007
and that's where most people,

00:24:52.031 --> 00:24:54.585
you know, the average person
has their money.

00:24:54.609 --> 00:24:57.750
And I know that everything
is changing day-to-day,

00:24:57.774 --> 00:25:00.681
but I also know that everyone
is going to have this question

00:25:00.705 --> 00:25:01.863
on their minds.

00:25:01.887 --> 00:25:03.202
So I'm going to ask you --

00:25:03.226 --> 00:25:05.686
I'm not going to ask
for specific investment advice,

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:08.682
but everyone's thinking
about their 401(k)s.

00:25:08.706 --> 00:25:10.262
Do you have any general thoughts

00:25:10.286 --> 00:25:15.801
about how people should approach
this time period with that kind of money?

00:25:16.703 --> 00:25:17.869
RD: Yeah.

00:25:17.893 --> 00:25:19.139
First of all ...

00:25:20.521 --> 00:25:24.552
an investor must understand

00:25:24.576 --> 00:25:28.297
that they probably will not be able
to play the game well.

00:25:28.321 --> 00:25:31.952
They probably will not be able
to decide how to move in

00:25:31.976 --> 00:25:34.273
and out of things.

00:25:34.297 --> 00:25:36.444
In order to be successful in the markets,

00:25:36.468 --> 00:25:42.727
it is more difficult than getting
a gold medal in the Olympics.

00:25:43.583 --> 00:25:46.220
You wouldn't think
about competing in the Olympics,

00:25:46.244 --> 00:25:49.064
but everybody thinks
they can compete in the markets.

00:25:49.088 --> 00:25:51.516
But there's more money competing.

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.357
It's like a zero-sum game

00:25:53.381 --> 00:25:54.921
and there's more money doing it,

00:25:54.945 --> 00:25:56.520
and the worst thing you could do

00:25:56.544 --> 00:26:00.772
is think you can time
all of these movements.

00:26:00.796 --> 00:26:04.010
I guarantee you, the game is a tough game.

00:26:04.034 --> 00:26:07.304
We put hundreds of millions of dollars
into the game every year.

00:26:07.328 --> 00:26:09.061
And it's tough.

00:26:09.085 --> 00:26:12.966
So what the individual
investor needs to do

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:16.109
is know how to diversify well.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.401
So the word that I would --

00:26:18.425 --> 00:26:22.553
Know how to diversify well
and in a balanced way.

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:25.783
The greatest mistake of all investors

00:26:25.807 --> 00:26:30.109
is to think that what has done well lately

00:26:30.133 --> 00:26:32.125
is a better investment,

00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:33.949
rather than more expensive.

00:26:34.347 --> 00:26:40.038
And what has done worse lately
is the worst investment,

00:26:40.062 --> 00:26:41.704
"get me out of it,"

00:26:41.728 --> 00:26:43.261
rather than "it's cheap."

00:26:43.672 --> 00:26:46.680
And unless you know how to deal
with the differences of those,

00:26:46.704 --> 00:26:47.926
which most people don't,

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:49.458
they're going to be in trouble.

00:26:49.482 --> 00:26:51.759
So understand that wealth,

00:26:51.783 --> 00:26:54.617
total amount of wealth in the world,

00:26:54.641 --> 00:26:57.799
essentially doesn't change very much, OK?

00:26:57.823 --> 00:27:01.162
And that one thing goes up,
another thing goes down.

00:27:01.577 --> 00:27:03.878
And to know how to diversify.

00:27:03.902 --> 00:27:06.395
To diversify it in asset classes,

00:27:06.419 --> 00:27:08.807
to diversify it in countries.

00:27:09.901 --> 00:27:12.456
To diversify it in currencies.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.797
To know how to diversify that well,

00:27:15.821 --> 00:27:18.948
so that you have wealth
diversification, is important.

00:27:18.972 --> 00:27:23.448
Do not think that cash
is a safe investment.

00:27:23.981 --> 00:27:27.768
Most people think,
"Look, I just want safety.

00:27:27.792 --> 00:27:31.029
And those bonds aren't giving me
an interest rate," and so on,

00:27:31.053 --> 00:27:32.720
"So where do I get safe?"

00:27:33.855 --> 00:27:36.426
Cash is a seductive investment,

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.386
because it doesn't have
as much volatility.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:44.378
But it taxes you and your buying power
about two percent a year.

00:27:44.854 --> 00:27:49.044
And so cash is almost always
the worst investment.

00:27:49.584 --> 00:27:51.259
So you have to think about that.

00:27:51.283 --> 00:27:54.060
You should think
a little bit unconventionally.

00:27:54.084 --> 00:27:56.278
Do you have a little bit of gold?

00:27:56.302 --> 00:27:58.773
Do you have a little bit of,

00:27:58.797 --> 00:28:02.865
in case this monetary system
breaks down and money is redefined,

00:28:02.889 --> 00:28:04.596
do you have a little bit of that?

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:09.055
I can't get into all the different ways
that one can diversify well.

00:28:09.079 --> 00:28:11.207
I try to convey those things in my books,

00:28:11.231 --> 00:28:16.871
or posts on LinkedIn, particularly.

00:28:16.895 --> 00:28:19.736
But I would say, diversify well,

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.426
be humble, don't market time

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.500
and be conscious of the dangers of cash.

00:28:27.171 --> 00:28:29.212
CH: Right, that's great advice.

00:28:29.751 --> 00:28:33.021
I want to ask one more,
sort of, big-picture question

00:28:33.045 --> 00:28:36.244
before we start getting
into how we should fix capitalism.

00:28:36.268 --> 00:28:38.934
We can talk about that in a minute,

00:28:38.958 --> 00:28:40.641
tackle that one.

00:28:40.665 --> 00:28:42.968
But I have been reading
your series on LinkedIn,

00:28:42.992 --> 00:28:44.928
"The Changing World Order."

00:28:44.952 --> 00:28:46.611
It's really fascinating.

00:28:46.635 --> 00:28:48.317
I'm curious what you think about,

00:28:48.341 --> 00:28:52.571
there's been, sort of,
this retreat from globalization

00:28:52.595 --> 00:28:54.931
as something we should all get behind,

00:28:54.955 --> 00:28:59.333
and I'm curious what you think
about that in terms of our recovery.

00:28:59.357 --> 00:29:00.730
This seems like something

00:29:00.754 --> 00:29:04.127
that is going to require
a coordinated effort,

00:29:04.151 --> 00:29:07.101
you know, financially, spiritually,

00:29:07.125 --> 00:29:08.506
in so many different ways.

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:10.863
If we retreat from
globalization right now,

00:29:10.887 --> 00:29:14.042
does that make everything
harder going forward?

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.983
RD: If we retreat from globalization,

00:29:19.007 --> 00:29:20.999
which we certainly will do,

00:29:21.023 --> 00:29:23.998
it will certainly make things very hard.

00:29:24.387 --> 00:29:28.728
And so we get down to comparing idealism

00:29:28.752 --> 00:29:30.037
with reality.

00:29:30.664 --> 00:29:37.323
So when you say
globalization, will that --

00:29:37.347 --> 00:29:42.579
who will write what checks
to people in countries

00:29:42.603 --> 00:29:45.182
that will be outside of their domain?

00:29:45.206 --> 00:29:48.135
And there are large numbers
of those people.

00:29:48.159 --> 00:29:51.394
You know, my wife and I
are trying to help people in Connecticut.

00:29:51.418 --> 00:29:55.760
And you know, I can rattle off
all that is, what a job that is,

00:29:55.784 --> 00:29:56.946
and so on.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:30:00.642
And so, when you have
congresses and presidents

00:30:00.666 --> 00:30:03.134
and they start to say, who will we help,

00:30:03.158 --> 00:30:04.610
and how will that be,

00:30:04.634 --> 00:30:06.150
and what will that mean,

00:30:06.174 --> 00:30:09.166
it gets down to real practical questions.

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:10.356
And the reality is,

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.822
a lot of those people won't be helped.

00:30:12.846 --> 00:30:14.695
And then you'll deal with,

00:30:14.719 --> 00:30:17.437
how will they behave for each other?

00:30:17.461 --> 00:30:23.752
One country's vulnerabilities,
another country's opportunities.

00:30:23.776 --> 00:30:28.606
In such times,
this is the case, because --

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:31.932
You know, Graham Allison

00:30:31.956 --> 00:30:34.641
wrote a book about the Thucydides trap,

00:30:34.665 --> 00:30:36.458
and he reminds us,

00:30:36.482 --> 00:30:38.580
over the last 500 years,

00:30:38.604 --> 00:30:41.529
there have been 16 countries

00:30:41.553 --> 00:30:45.526
in which there's been a rivalry
of an empire challenging another.

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:48.350
In 12 of those cases,
there have been wars.

00:30:48.662 --> 00:30:53.061
Because, at the end of the day,
there's not even a global legal system.

00:30:53.085 --> 00:30:57.690
Power is what is the currency of that.

00:30:58.006 --> 00:31:01.617
So when you get into
how do you resolve the dispute

00:31:01.641 --> 00:31:03.728
as to who gets what,

00:31:03.752 --> 00:31:06.485
that becomes a very complicated question.

00:31:06.974 --> 00:31:09.276
So I'm a globalist.

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.807
Meaning, I have a dream and a wish

00:31:12.831 --> 00:31:16.036
that the best of the best
can operate together

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:19.537
and work together
for that common good and so on.

00:31:19.561 --> 00:31:21.291
But it's dying,

00:31:21.315 --> 00:31:25.216
because we're in an interconnected,
fragmented world.

00:31:25.525 --> 00:31:27.450
The fragmentation of this,

00:31:27.474 --> 00:31:32.121
"Can I depend on somebody else
to give me something I need?"

00:31:32.145 --> 00:31:36.146
Or "Can I depend on them
not taking advantage of me?"

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:39.051
No, you can't make
those dependencies anymore.

00:31:39.075 --> 00:31:42.507
And that exists within countries
as well as between countries.

00:31:43.511 --> 00:31:47.133
CH: Yeah, I mean, it seems like,
you talk about productivity

00:31:47.157 --> 00:31:52.387
and the importance of productivity
for us all to have a better life,

00:31:52.411 --> 00:31:54.706
and it just seems like on a global level,

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:56.053
the same should hold true.

00:31:56.077 --> 00:31:59.593
If we're all focused
on being more productive together,

00:31:59.617 --> 00:32:01.101
and in that interconnected way,

00:32:01.125 --> 00:32:02.300
we'll all do better,

00:32:02.324 --> 00:32:05.807
as opposed to, kind of, hoarding one asset

00:32:05.831 --> 00:32:08.983
or one set of resources.

00:32:09.515 --> 00:32:12.237
RD: You're certainly true.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.479
That has always been true,
but never more true than today.

00:32:17.712 --> 00:32:20.776
And at the same time,

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.037
read history.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:25.645
And understand the mechanics

00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:28.502
and the issues and the challenges of this.

00:32:28.526 --> 00:32:31.962
This separation began before we had

00:32:31.986 --> 00:32:36.728
this isolation of the United States
relative to the rest of the world.

00:32:36.752 --> 00:32:39.148
This deglobalization

00:32:39.172 --> 00:32:43.591
began before we had this
that fosters more of it, right?

00:32:44.093 --> 00:32:47.149
And it happened for reasons, OK?

00:32:47.173 --> 00:32:49.268
So don't overlook those reasons,

00:32:49.292 --> 00:32:52.062
and don't overlook the reading of history,

00:32:52.086 --> 00:32:54.713
just because we wish it can happen.

00:32:54.737 --> 00:32:56.736
If you want to wish it happens,

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.340
everything is all dependent

00:32:59.364 --> 00:33:01.637
on the behavior of those

00:33:01.661 --> 00:33:05.006
who have their hands
on the levers of power.

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:08.926
I would tell you,
like, for example, right now --

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:12.625
I've been going to China for a long time,

00:33:12.649 --> 00:33:17.664
and the Chinese,
in many ways, are helping,

00:33:17.688 --> 00:33:22.246
in many ways, things that are needed
in this crisis and all that.

00:33:22.593 --> 00:33:24.569
To even say that

00:33:24.593 --> 00:33:28.632
is a politically challenging thing, OK?

00:33:28.656 --> 00:33:32.387
Because we're in a world
that is so fragmented

00:33:32.411 --> 00:33:35.276
that even to publicly say "thank you,"

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:39.427
and "thank you" to many people
and many companies --

00:33:39.451 --> 00:33:44.133
It's almost dangerous to say "thank you"
to those who are helping,

00:33:44.157 --> 00:33:50.427
because we're now in an environment
in which there are enemies.

00:33:50.451 --> 00:33:52.086
And who is evil?

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:54.443
And do you fall into that category?

00:33:54.776 --> 00:33:57.126
And so, the history of these

00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:00.427
is there's demonizations
of different people.

00:34:01.275 --> 00:34:02.428
OK?

00:34:02.452 --> 00:34:04.441
Now you must see it around you.

00:34:04.465 --> 00:34:05.782
It exists.

00:34:05.806 --> 00:34:10.810
And so how we come out of this
will be how we behave with each other.

00:34:11.904 --> 00:34:13.055
CH: Yeah.

00:34:13.079 --> 00:34:14.562
That's such an important point,

00:34:14.586 --> 00:34:17.579
and I think all of us here
would say "thank you"

00:34:17.603 --> 00:34:21.221
to, you know, the different people
helping out in this situation.

00:34:21.245 --> 00:34:23.980
We do need each other.

00:34:24.004 --> 00:34:27.695
I do want to get
to this issue of capitalism.

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:29.822
Because when we talked a few days ago,

00:34:29.846 --> 00:34:33.204
you mentioned -- and earlier
in this conversation as well --

00:34:33.228 --> 00:34:36.982
how, you know, this period of time
we can emerge stronger and better

00:34:37.006 --> 00:34:38.331
than before.

00:34:38.355 --> 00:34:41.386
And about a year ago, you wrote a piece

00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:45.418
about how capitalism needs to be reformed,

00:34:45.442 --> 00:34:48.569
focused a lot on the wealth gap,
the growing wealth gap

00:34:48.593 --> 00:34:50.799
and the problems that that's causing.

00:34:50.823 --> 00:34:52.498
So what's our opportunity here,

00:34:52.522 --> 00:34:54.315
what changes can we make?

00:34:55.998 --> 00:35:01.037
RD: Well, you know, what I was seeing was,

00:35:01.061 --> 00:35:03.646
do we want the outcomes
that we're getting,

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.334
that the system is producing?

00:35:06.144 --> 00:35:08.009
Do we have --

00:35:08.033 --> 00:35:09.937
What is our American dream?

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:13.016
What is that?

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.934
We're not even almost talking about that.

00:35:15.958 --> 00:35:17.425
When I was growing up --

00:35:17.879 --> 00:35:22.609
So again, I was born 1949,

00:35:22.633 --> 00:35:24.990
right after the new
world order was created.

00:35:25.014 --> 00:35:27.537
New world order was created 1945.

00:35:28.522 --> 00:35:29.929
In 1945.

00:35:29.953 --> 00:35:32.553
And that was when there was
the breakdown of the system

00:35:32.577 --> 00:35:34.252
and then we had a new world order.

00:35:34.276 --> 00:35:35.633
We didn't have as much debt,

00:35:35.657 --> 00:35:37.029
we came back [from] the war,

00:35:37.053 --> 00:35:41.124
and there was an environment
of equal opportunity.

00:35:42.506 --> 00:35:46.182
And that notion of equal opportunity.

00:35:46.206 --> 00:35:48.610
And there was an American dream.

00:35:48.634 --> 00:35:50.213
And there was a harmony

00:35:50.237 --> 00:35:52.571
and a going through it together.

00:35:52.595 --> 00:35:54.531
And by the way, that's not a one-off.

00:35:54.555 --> 00:35:56.037
If you read histories,

00:35:56.061 --> 00:36:00.458
you see these periods of collapse
and clash and fighting,

00:36:00.482 --> 00:36:02.728
followed by these periods of --

00:36:03.125 --> 00:36:05.736
You know, you construct
the balance sheets,

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.712
you change the system
and then you begin a new system

00:36:08.736 --> 00:36:10.926
and you come back and you work together.

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:14.407
And then I'm seeing, around me,

00:36:14.431 --> 00:36:18.376
children in school and education systems
in poor neighborhoods

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.169
are sharing --

00:36:20.639 --> 00:36:22.426
They don't have adequate resources.

00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:24.403
There's no excuse.

00:36:24.704 --> 00:36:30.571
And so the idea that the profit system
can accomplish everything

00:36:30.595 --> 00:36:33.434
is not right.

00:36:33.458 --> 00:36:38.242
Because resource allocation
goes to those who have the resource.

00:36:38.266 --> 00:36:40.311
And so throughout all history,

00:36:40.335 --> 00:36:42.442
you go back hundreds of years,

00:36:42.466 --> 00:36:44.204
you see that any system

00:36:44.228 --> 00:36:48.180
works for those who tend
to control the system.

00:36:48.204 --> 00:36:51.172
So let's say we have a capitalist system,

00:36:51.196 --> 00:36:53.121
and we have entrepreneurs,

00:36:53.145 --> 00:36:56.831
and you acquire money, and all that.

00:36:56.855 --> 00:36:59.929
And then, working
with those in government,

00:36:59.953 --> 00:37:03.024
and they have a symbiotic relationship

00:37:03.048 --> 00:37:04.366
and it works well for them.

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:06.089
So it's self-perpetuating,

00:37:06.113 --> 00:37:10.243
because the education
of those who are those,

00:37:10.267 --> 00:37:13.426
is better than the education
of those who aren't those.

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:15.418
So, for example,

00:37:15.442 --> 00:37:20.020
in our system, those in the top 40 percent

00:37:20.044 --> 00:37:25.655
on average, spend five times as much money
on their children's education

00:37:25.679 --> 00:37:28.196
than those who are
in the bottom 60 percent.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.620
And so it becomes self-perpetuating.

00:37:31.038 --> 00:37:32.633
And so when I look at that,

00:37:32.657 --> 00:37:34.617
I'm saying, "I'm a capitalist,

00:37:34.641 --> 00:37:37.918
please understand, I'm a capitalist,
I believe in the system,

00:37:37.942 --> 00:37:40.982
I believe you can increase
the size of the pie

00:37:41.006 --> 00:37:42.506
and you can divide it well,

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:45.149
and if we talk about
how to do that effectively,

00:37:45.173 --> 00:37:46.344
we need to do it."

00:37:46.368 --> 00:37:49.545
But there comes a time
that there needs reforms.

00:37:49.569 --> 00:37:52.903
And those reforms
have to create productivity.

00:37:52.927 --> 00:37:55.093
It doesn't mean just give money away.

00:37:55.117 --> 00:37:58.125
It means, how do you make
those people productive,

00:37:58.149 --> 00:38:01.576
so that they're also
psychologically productive

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.577
as well as physically productive

00:38:03.601 --> 00:38:05.021
and producing output.

00:38:05.045 --> 00:38:06.442
You need to do that system.

00:38:06.466 --> 00:38:09.291
And so for reasons I wrote on that page,

00:38:09.315 --> 00:38:11.021
that post --

00:38:11.045 --> 00:38:13.037
it's on LinkedIn if people want it --

00:38:13.061 --> 00:38:14.886
that you need to restructure it.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:17.799
Now we are restructuring it, OK?

00:38:17.823 --> 00:38:22.434
It's the inevitable consequence
of what we're doing here.

00:38:22.458 --> 00:38:23.672
We will come out of that.

00:38:23.696 --> 00:38:25.887
There has been a tremendous
transfer of wealth,

00:38:25.911 --> 00:38:27.625
whether people realize it or not,

00:38:27.649 --> 00:38:31.113
through the production
of all of that borrowed money.

00:38:31.542 --> 00:38:33.391
And all of that producing of money,

00:38:33.415 --> 00:38:35.407
that is a big force.

00:38:35.431 --> 00:38:36.645
We will come out of here,

00:38:36.669 --> 00:38:40.608
and the thing we will talk about
over the next couple of years,

00:38:40.632 --> 00:38:43.061
and probably sooner rather than later,

00:38:43.085 --> 00:38:45.236
is how we do that restructuring.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:48.890
And my worry now
is the same as my worry then.

00:38:48.914 --> 00:38:53.081
Whether that will be done
in a civil, bipartisan way

00:38:53.105 --> 00:38:56.343
that will both increase
the size of the pie

00:38:56.367 --> 00:38:57.566
and divide it well,

00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:59.972
rather than damage the economy,

00:38:59.996 --> 00:39:02.218
because you lose productivity.

00:39:02.242 --> 00:39:04.687
There are certain things
that are great investments,

00:39:04.711 --> 00:39:06.742
education is a great investment.

00:39:06.766 --> 00:39:09.863
The more people you have
that are well-educated,

00:39:09.887 --> 00:39:11.934
and you have equal education,

00:39:11.958 --> 00:39:13.792
the more people you are going to have

00:39:13.816 --> 00:39:16.720
who have the chance
to compete with each other,

00:39:16.744 --> 00:39:18.910
and raise that over a period of time.

00:39:18.934 --> 00:39:21.355
It's a hell of an investment.

00:39:21.379 --> 00:39:25.654
It will produce more productivity
than it ever will cost,

00:39:25.678 --> 00:39:26.995
if it's done well.

00:39:27.019 --> 00:39:28.408
But what happens is,

00:39:28.432 --> 00:39:32.519
states and localities
think of it as a budget item.

00:39:32.543 --> 00:39:34.099
So they look at expenses.

00:39:34.123 --> 00:39:36.532
And they penny-pinch on the education.

00:39:36.556 --> 00:39:40.214
Because if you're in a rich town,
your kids will get a good education.

00:39:40.238 --> 00:39:41.413
And if you're not --

00:39:41.437 --> 00:39:44.071
And a large percentage
of the population is losing that.

00:39:44.095 --> 00:39:45.953
So that has to be engineered well,

00:39:45.977 --> 00:39:48.175
so that they are productive,

00:39:48.199 --> 00:39:50.596
as well as divide the pie well,

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:54.040
and everybody believes
that the system is fair.

00:39:54.064 --> 00:39:55.399
We can get there.

00:39:55.778 --> 00:39:58.164
Am I optimistic that we will get there?

00:39:58.188 --> 00:39:59.347
You know, I don't know.

00:39:59.371 --> 00:40:01.878
I would say, I'm 60-40 pessimistic

00:40:01.902 --> 00:40:04.862
that we'll be good enough
with each other to do that.

00:40:04.886 --> 00:40:06.839
But there's that possibility.

00:40:06.863 --> 00:40:08.124
This is our test.

00:40:08.434 --> 00:40:10.034
This is our stress test.

00:40:12.236 --> 00:40:15.094
CA: Ray, there's so much
interest in this question

00:40:15.118 --> 00:40:18.196
of how we emerge from this,

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:21.682
whether it's genuinely possible
to rebuild the economy

00:40:21.706 --> 00:40:23.307
in a way that's fairer.

00:40:23.331 --> 00:40:26.868
I just want to read one last question,
this one's from my Twitter feed.

00:40:27.243 --> 00:40:29.458
"Do you think that the current crisis

00:40:29.482 --> 00:40:33.609
is showing that low-paid
and/or unskilled workers

00:40:33.633 --> 00:40:36.103
are what holds countries together,

00:40:36.127 --> 00:40:38.794
even more so than banks and hedge funds?

00:40:39.135 --> 00:40:41.651
And if so, as part of the rebuilding,

00:40:41.675 --> 00:40:46.410
can we build an economy
that raises their interest higher?"

00:40:48.382 --> 00:40:49.532
RD: Those --

00:40:50.191 --> 00:40:53.326
The heroes are those kind of people.

00:40:54.256 --> 00:40:55.786
OK, really.

00:40:56.375 --> 00:41:00.307
But it takes everyone, OK?

00:41:00.331 --> 00:41:05.355
It takes the efficient
allocation of resources for --

00:41:06.601 --> 00:41:09.418
As you probably have seen
behind the scenes,

00:41:09.442 --> 00:41:13.545
we see those who control
a lot of resources

00:41:13.569 --> 00:41:15.585
being able to make contributions.

00:41:15.927 --> 00:41:20.679
We're giving 60,000 computers
to poor students,

00:41:20.703 --> 00:41:22.744
so that they can learn.

00:41:22.768 --> 00:41:26.941
You know, the difference
between a rich and a poor student

00:41:26.965 --> 00:41:30.046
is having a computer
and having the ability to learn.

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:35.403
And I want to thank
those who would be embarrassed

00:41:35.427 --> 00:41:37.116
and almost afraid to hear it

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:39.696
of how they contributed to that process.

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:43.062
And at the same time, those other people,

00:41:43.086 --> 00:41:46.966
who are every day serving in so many ways,

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:51.290
so it's good character and it's that --

00:41:51.314 --> 00:41:53.315
You know, when people came back from war,

00:41:53.339 --> 00:41:55.379
they built the greatest generation.

00:41:55.403 --> 00:41:59.894
It's that type of character
that brings our country together,

00:41:59.918 --> 00:42:03.879
but each has to recognize
their roles in doing that.

00:42:03.903 --> 00:42:05.989
So there's a CEO

00:42:06.013 --> 00:42:08.809
and then there's somebody
who's really a great hero

00:42:08.833 --> 00:42:10.378
on the front lines,

00:42:10.402 --> 00:42:14.117
and they better damn
work well together, so yeah.

00:42:14.141 --> 00:42:16.991
And then, they have to have usefulness.

00:42:17.315 --> 00:42:18.910
And we've got to appreciate them.

00:42:18.934 --> 00:42:23.188
We have to establish --
just the reality, I think --

00:42:23.212 --> 00:42:27.347
that there is a level of basics.

00:42:27.371 --> 00:42:30.308
Basic education,

00:42:30.332 --> 00:42:34.148
basic health care --

00:42:34.172 --> 00:42:37.450
Basics that you cannot fall below.

00:42:38.469 --> 00:42:39.620
OK?

00:42:39.644 --> 00:42:42.945
Otherwise, when you go below that level,

00:42:42.969 --> 00:42:44.612
there is no opportunity,

00:42:44.636 --> 00:42:47.252
and actually, the costliness of it,

00:42:47.276 --> 00:42:50.299
in the form of crimes and incarceration.

00:42:50.323 --> 00:42:52.506
Like, to bring it personal,

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:56.430
our mission is to help high school kids

00:42:56.454 --> 00:42:59.311
who dropped out of high school
and can have jobs,

00:42:59.335 --> 00:43:02.279
to get them in that high school
and through that, in jobs.

00:43:02.303 --> 00:43:05.831
And we believe that we can do that
and save a lot of money,

00:43:05.855 --> 00:43:12.180
because the average cost of incarceration,

00:43:12.204 --> 00:43:16.644
it goes from about 40,000 dollars a year
up to 120,000 dollars a year,

00:43:16.668 --> 00:43:18.017
depending on the form.

00:43:18.041 --> 00:43:21.589
And if you get them in
and move them into a job,

00:43:21.613 --> 00:43:23.381
you're going to save a lot of money,

00:43:23.405 --> 00:43:25.332
and we could do that cost-effectively.

00:43:25.356 --> 00:43:28.887
But philanthropists can't do this alone.

00:43:28.911 --> 00:43:30.593
The amount of money is enormous.

00:43:30.617 --> 00:43:35.100
So if our country did those
kinds of things, I think ...

00:43:35.942 --> 00:43:37.676
I think it would be great.

00:43:39.694 --> 00:43:41.360
CA: Wow, thank you for that, Ray.

00:43:41.384 --> 00:43:42.654
Corey, what do you think?

00:43:43.091 --> 00:43:46.194
Have you got any other questions there
before we wrap up?

00:43:46.924 --> 00:43:48.385
CH: No, I think we're good,

00:43:48.409 --> 00:43:50.903
I mean, I think
we're going to get through it,

00:43:50.927 --> 00:43:52.474
I guess is what we're saying,

00:43:52.498 --> 00:43:55.260
but we also have an opportunity here

00:43:55.284 --> 00:43:58.436
to make some changes and do better
and emerge stronger.

00:43:58.460 --> 00:43:59.673
And as you said,

00:43:59.697 --> 00:44:02.697
take a look at things
and the structures that we have in place

00:44:02.721 --> 00:44:04.348
and see where we can improve,

00:44:04.372 --> 00:44:08.791
but it's going to take
a collective action and cooperation.

00:44:09.894 --> 00:44:11.711
CA: Yeah, Ray, I'm definitely inspired

00:44:11.735 --> 00:44:16.077
by the actions that you're taking
as a philanthropist

00:44:16.101 --> 00:44:17.831
in this moment.

00:44:17.855 --> 00:44:19.545
And some of your peers,

00:44:19.569 --> 00:44:21.760
you know, there are amazing
stories out there.

00:44:21.784 --> 00:44:24.570
I was really struck by Jack Dorsey's
announcement yesterday

00:44:24.594 --> 00:44:26.791
of his huge philanthropic contribution.

00:44:26.815 --> 00:44:31.816
And, I mean, that's awesome,
but equally important, I was --

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.418
RD: But it's not nearly enough.

00:44:33.442 --> 00:44:34.783
CA: Exactly, and I'm --

00:44:34.807 --> 00:44:36.569
CH: It would be good to see more.

00:44:36.593 --> 00:44:39.426
CA: I'm kind of dismayed, in a way,

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:42.545
to hear you say that you're 60/40
leaning pessimistic,

00:44:42.569 --> 00:44:45.246
like, it feels like your voice

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:48.421
in these conversations that are going on
in the corridors of power

00:44:48.445 --> 00:44:51.278
and you know, where the big money is,

00:44:51.302 --> 00:44:55.410
around whether this turns
into fundamentally, cooperation

00:44:55.434 --> 00:44:58.376
between countries and between companies

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:02.133
and between, you know,
big-money controllers,

00:45:02.157 --> 00:45:05.482
or whether it turns into a fistfight,

00:45:05.506 --> 00:45:06.855
is so important.

00:45:06.879 --> 00:45:09.617
And hearing you talk about the gratitude

00:45:09.641 --> 00:45:13.138
we should be feeling towards
some aspects, let's say,

00:45:13.162 --> 00:45:15.011
of what China has done,

00:45:15.035 --> 00:45:16.344
the extent --

00:45:16.368 --> 00:45:18.374
Do you find yourself in conversations,

00:45:18.398 --> 00:45:21.019
like, raising this,
trying to take the view that,

00:45:21.043 --> 00:45:25.133
"No, no, no, you're needlessly
sparking friction here,

00:45:25.157 --> 00:45:27.228
take a more generous view"?

00:45:27.252 --> 00:45:29.689
Because it feels to me
like there's so much at stake

00:45:29.713 --> 00:45:32.696
between how many people
are trying to nudge

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:34.395
that type of conversation

00:45:34.419 --> 00:45:38.450
versus the hostile, fearful conversation.

00:45:39.505 --> 00:45:45.254
RD: I think there's a general
mistaken belief --

00:45:45.278 --> 00:45:48.247
I communicate a lot with the people
that you're saying,

00:45:48.271 --> 00:45:51.072
people in positions of power,

00:45:51.096 --> 00:45:55.125
whether they're both in government
or other places, and so on.

00:45:55.149 --> 00:45:57.778
I think what you basically have to realize

00:45:57.802 --> 00:46:01.913
is that very few people
are making decisions

00:46:01.937 --> 00:46:06.842
based on the quality of the argument.

00:46:06.866 --> 00:46:09.725
That most people are --

00:46:09.749 --> 00:46:14.107
Most of those are in a war of some kind

00:46:14.131 --> 00:46:17.010
or have a particular objective.

00:46:17.034 --> 00:46:20.105
And that the information that comes out,

00:46:20.129 --> 00:46:23.406
even in the media --

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:27.515
you know, you could almost see
which side each media outlet

00:46:27.539 --> 00:46:29.403
or each person is on.

00:46:29.427 --> 00:46:33.418
How many people do you really believe

00:46:33.442 --> 00:46:34.934
don't have a side?

00:46:35.506 --> 00:46:37.768
Almost everybody has --

00:46:37.792 --> 00:46:40.164
they're on one side or another side.

00:46:40.561 --> 00:46:43.712
And the idea of being able
to see things from both sides

00:46:43.736 --> 00:46:45.252
and come together,

00:46:45.276 --> 00:46:49.283
is, in this time and through history,

00:46:49.307 --> 00:46:52.228
perceived as almost being weak

00:46:52.252 --> 00:46:54.228
or a threat.

00:46:54.641 --> 00:46:58.371
Because you've got to get
on one side or the other side

00:46:58.395 --> 00:46:59.554
and so on.

00:46:59.578 --> 00:47:04.518
And so it's not easy to just say --

00:47:04.542 --> 00:47:08.601
Like, all the people,
and China for example, I would say,

00:47:08.625 --> 00:47:09.831
"Thank you very much,"

00:47:09.855 --> 00:47:14.095
you know how many respirators
and masks and all these things

00:47:14.119 --> 00:47:15.283
that have come?

00:47:15.307 --> 00:47:17.417
But almost that's politically challenging.

00:47:17.441 --> 00:47:19.472
Because there will be people out there,

00:47:19.496 --> 00:47:22.105
and threatening, why am I doing this?

00:47:22.129 --> 00:47:24.425
People will be out there
and they will say,

00:47:24.449 --> 00:47:28.379
"OK, he's a China lover"
or "he's an enemy,"

00:47:28.403 --> 00:47:30.236
"he goes on the other side."

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:33.760
Because there will be people
on the other sides, and those people --

00:47:33.784 --> 00:47:36.465
And so I think I'll turn to you, Chris.

00:47:36.777 --> 00:47:38.182
You have a forum.

00:47:38.206 --> 00:47:41.237
Bring in the other sides, OK?

00:47:41.261 --> 00:47:44.403
Bring in those that are those who,

00:47:44.427 --> 00:47:47.998
let's say, have the most
offensive policies that you think

00:47:48.022 --> 00:47:49.656
that are in positions of power.

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:50.887
And have that together,

00:47:50.911 --> 00:47:54.589
so that you can have
thoughtful disagreement.

00:47:54.613 --> 00:47:58.494
I'm a believer in thoughtful disagreement.

00:47:58.518 --> 00:48:00.168
Open, thoughtful disagreement

00:48:00.192 --> 00:48:02.922
to try to get at the right answer
and have collectiveness.

00:48:02.946 --> 00:48:05.324
But it isn't easy in this world.

00:48:07.186 --> 00:48:09.139
CA: Well, that's a good challenge to us,

00:48:09.163 --> 00:48:12.163
and I'm also a believer
in [thoughtful] disagreement,

00:48:12.187 --> 00:48:15.149
I think, Corey,
we're passionate disbelievers

00:48:15.173 --> 00:48:20.124
in the spreading of irrational hatred.

00:48:20.148 --> 00:48:21.828
Like, instinctual irrational hatred

00:48:21.852 --> 00:48:26.346
and I feel like the stakes
are so high right now, that if --

00:48:27.371 --> 00:48:29.504
RD: But will you fight for that?

00:48:29.942 --> 00:48:31.093
In other words,

00:48:31.117 --> 00:48:35.046
when somebody's going to punch back --

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:36.887
Because this is what's needed.

00:48:36.911 --> 00:48:38.871
If somebody's going to punch back

00:48:38.895 --> 00:48:41.649
because you're saying
something that's true

00:48:41.673 --> 00:48:44.945
and controversial,

00:48:44.969 --> 00:48:46.190
that will be the test --

00:48:46.214 --> 00:48:50.340
Can you punch back
for collective, you know,

00:48:50.364 --> 00:48:51.733
decision-making comment,

00:48:51.757 --> 00:48:54.157
decision making and then punch back?

00:48:54.934 --> 00:48:58.633
CA: I'm not going to say punch,
I'm going to say fight back, absolutely.

00:48:58.657 --> 00:49:00.649
RD: OK, fight back, that's good.

00:49:00.673 --> 00:49:02.119
CA: With every fiber we have.

00:49:02.143 --> 00:49:05.375
If it means that we look weak
or we're a threat, so damn well be it,

00:49:05.399 --> 00:49:08.253
because you know, this is the moment.

00:49:08.277 --> 00:49:11.093
I mean, everyone
is impacting everyone else.

00:49:11.117 --> 00:49:14.450
We have a shot to nudge each other
to be our better selves.

00:49:14.474 --> 00:49:17.208
And to look at the stories of inspiration,

00:49:17.232 --> 00:49:19.799
the stories of humans
reaching out to humans,

00:49:19.823 --> 00:49:21.901
of companies doing incredible things,

00:49:21.925 --> 00:49:24.244
letting go of the profit
motive for a moment,

00:49:24.268 --> 00:49:27.197
of countries trying to help each other --

00:49:27.221 --> 00:49:28.658
there are stories about that.

00:49:28.682 --> 00:49:32.840
I think we need to amplify
some of those stories more.

00:49:32.864 --> 00:49:34.610
And we're certainly down to do that.

00:49:34.634 --> 00:49:36.309
We're trying to do that every day.

00:49:36.333 --> 00:49:41.054
And Ray, I loved hearing you
talk about some of the good things

00:49:41.078 --> 00:49:43.522
that China is doing, all the rest of it.

00:49:43.546 --> 00:49:46.017
Thank you for your voice
and for spending this time

00:49:46.041 --> 00:49:50.008
and for being, you know,
honest and vigorous with us.

00:49:51.037 --> 00:49:52.926
And thank you, everyone, for listening.

00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:54.101
RD: I appreciate it.

00:49:54.125 --> 00:49:55.278
CA: A big damn deal.

00:49:55.302 --> 00:49:58.156
If you're listening, it sounded like
you just got a warning

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:01.606
that this could be a multiyear
recession, depression.

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:07.154
That's scary, and more than ever,
we need to be in this together,

00:50:07.178 --> 00:50:09.260
as we've said again and again.

00:50:09.284 --> 00:50:14.799
RD: Well, in conclusion, --
I know we're wrapping up --

00:50:14.823 --> 00:50:17.351
yes, I believe this is a defining moment,

00:50:17.375 --> 00:50:19.446
we will get through it fine,

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:23.168
we will be restructured in important ways.

00:50:23.875 --> 00:50:25.537
So that's fine.

00:50:25.561 --> 00:50:30.172
And thank you for, you know,

00:50:30.196 --> 00:50:33.182
sharing ideas worth considering, you know.

00:50:35.173 --> 00:50:36.418
CA: Thank you, Ray.

00:50:36.442 --> 00:50:38.371
Thanks so much, everyone, for listening.

00:50:38.395 --> 00:50:41.592
Corey, we've still got
more days to the week.

00:50:41.616 --> 00:50:45.395
There's an amazing program tomorrow,

00:50:45.419 --> 00:50:49.220
we're going to take
a much more global look there

00:50:49.244 --> 00:50:51.817
that I'm superexcited about.

00:50:51.841 --> 00:50:54.053
We have a report
from the head of LabourNet,

00:50:54.077 --> 00:50:58.355
which is an organization in India
looking at mobile workers

00:50:58.379 --> 00:51:01.204
who just are facing this
horrific situation right now,

00:51:01.228 --> 00:51:04.412
where they're having to, in the lockdown,

00:51:04.436 --> 00:51:06.491
having to maybe walk home
hundreds of miles,

00:51:06.515 --> 00:51:09.466
or face police action.

00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:11.897
We've got a report
right from the front lines there

00:51:11.921 --> 00:51:13.149
as to what that's like

00:51:13.173 --> 00:51:15.617
in a country with a very different
set of trade-offs

00:51:15.641 --> 00:51:17.585
they're having to make between lockdown

00:51:17.609 --> 00:51:21.767
and giving the most impoverished a chance.

00:51:21.791 --> 00:51:26.656
And then, a wide-ranging discussion
with Fareed Zakaria,

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:29.760
who, you know, has this global view --

00:51:29.784 --> 00:51:31.458
you will have seen him on CNN --

00:51:31.482 --> 00:51:35.474
he's got this very
broad-ranging global view

00:51:35.498 --> 00:51:37.711
as to how to think about this thing.

00:51:37.735 --> 00:51:41.418
And to compare the different responses
of different countries.

00:51:41.442 --> 00:51:43.768
I think it's going to be
an amazing conversation,

00:51:43.792 --> 00:51:45.992
I urge you to come back for that.

00:51:46.562 --> 00:51:48.378
CH: It's so amazing --

00:51:48.402 --> 00:51:51.450
you know, we were talking about this
in a meeting this morning --

00:51:51.474 --> 00:51:54.613
this is a crisis that the whole world
is going through together,

00:51:54.637 --> 00:51:56.799
and I think that's
what's so unusual about it

00:51:56.823 --> 00:52:00.171
and there's so much to dig into,

00:52:00.195 --> 00:52:03.521
so much to learn about how it's affecting
everybody in different ways.

00:52:03.545 --> 00:52:05.478
So I'm glad we're continuing.

00:52:07.132 --> 00:52:09.079
CA: Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Ray.

00:52:09.103 --> 00:52:12.926
And you can see a recording of this,
if you didn't [see] the whole thing,

00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:19.887
by going, I think it's to
go.ted.com/tedconnects.

00:52:19.911 --> 00:52:24.560
And if you want to look
at Ray's work on this,

00:52:24.584 --> 00:52:26.417
just google Ray Dalio LinkedIn,

00:52:26.441 --> 00:52:29.520
and there's a whole series
of resources there.

00:52:29.544 --> 00:52:31.746
That's "Dalio" with one "L."

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:33.516
Ray, thank you so much for this.

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:35.968
This was really, really,
really interesting.

00:52:35.992 --> 00:52:37.484
Thank you so much. Thanks, all.

00:52:37.508 --> 00:52:38.658
CH: Thank you.
