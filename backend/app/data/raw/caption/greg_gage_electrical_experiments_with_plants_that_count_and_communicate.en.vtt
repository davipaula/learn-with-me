00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.016
I'm a neuroscientist,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.336
and I'm the co-founder of Backyard Brains,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.216
and our mission is to train
the next generation of neuroscientists

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.256
by taking graduate-level
neuroscience research equipment

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.720
and making it available for kids
in middle schools and high schools.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.376
And so when we go into the classroom,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.296
one way to get them thinking
about the brain, which is very complex,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.256
is to ask them a very simple
question about neuroscience,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.320
and that is, "What has a brain?"

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.296
When we ask that,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.375
students will instantly tell you
that their cat or dog has a brain,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.976
and most will say that a mouse
or even a small insect has a brain,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.816
but almost nobody says
that a plant or a tree

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.016
or a shrub has a brain.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.536
And so when you push --

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.136
because this could actually
help describe a little bit

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.336
how the brain actually functions --

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.576
so you push and say,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.136
"Well, what is it that makes
living things have brains versus not?"

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.616
And often they'll come back
with the classification

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.416
that things that move tend to have brains.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.056
And that's absolutely correct.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.536
Our nervous system evolved
because it is electrical.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.696
It's fast, so we can quickly respond
to stimuli in the world

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.936
and move if we need to.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.176
But you can go back
and push back on a student,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.256
and say, "Well, you know,
you say that plants don't have brains,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.736
but plants do move."

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.616
Anyone who has grown a plant

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.616
has noticed that the plant will move

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.456
and face the sun.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.616
But they'll say,
"But that's a slow movement.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.656
You know, that doesn't count.
That could be a chemical process."

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.056
But what about fast-moving plants?

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.176
Now, in 1760, Arthur Dobbs,
the Royal Governor of North Carolina,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.736
made a pretty fascinating discovery.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.616
In the swamps behind his house,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.296
he found a plant that would spring shut

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.000
every time a bug would fall in between it.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.656
He called this plant the flytrap,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.616
and within a decade,
it made its way over to Europe,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.176
where eventually the great Charles Darwin
got to study this plant,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.216
and this plant absolutely blew him away.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.776
He called it the most wonderful
plant in the world.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.056
This is a plant
that was an evolutionary wonder.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.056
This is a plant that moves quickly,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.376
which is rare,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.376
and it's carnivorous, which is also rare.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.856
And this is in the same plant.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.336
But I'm here today to tell you

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.776
that's not even the coolest thing
about this plant.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.320
The coolest thing
is that the plant can count.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.936
So in order to show that,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.136
we have to get some vocabulary
out of the way.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.416
So I'm going to do what we do
in the classroom with students.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.296
We're going to do
an experiment on electrophysiology,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.456
which is the recording
of the body's electrical signal,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.776
either coming from neurons
or from muscles.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.136
And I'm putting some electrodes
here on my wrists.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.496
As I hook them up,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.696
we're going to be able to see a signal

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.176
on the screen here.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.096
And this signal may be familiar to you.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.296
It's called the EKG,
or the electrocardiogram.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.776
And this is coming
from neurons in my heart

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.336
that are firing
what's called action potentials,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.216
potential meaning voltage and action
meaning it moves quickly up and down,

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.696
which causes my heart to fire,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.536
which then causes
the signal that you see here.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.296
And so I want you to remember the shape
of what we'll be looking at right here,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.176
because this is going to be important.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.616
This is a way that the brain
encodes information

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.336
in the form of an action potential.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.680
So now let's turn to some plants.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.456
So I'm going to first
introduce you to the mimosa,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.696
not the drink, but the Mimosa pudica,

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.056
and this is a plant that's found
in Central America and South America,

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.056
and it has behaviors.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.176
And the first behavior
I'm going to show you

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.296
is if I touch the leaves here,

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.520
you get to see that the leaves
tend to curl up.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.536
And then the second behavior is,

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.736
if I tap the leaf,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.576
the entire branch seems to fall down.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.136
So why does it do that?

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.776
It's not really known to science.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.016
One of the reasons why
could be that it scares away insects

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.216
or it looks less appealing to herbivores.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.736
But how does it do that?
Now, that's interesting.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.896
We can do an experiment to find out.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.376
So what we're going to do now,

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.816
just like I recorded
the electrical potential from my body,

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.656
we're going to record the electrical
potential from this plant, this mimosa.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.176
And so what we're going to do
is I've got a wire wrapped around the stem,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.280
and I've got the ground electrode where?

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.296
In the ground. It's an electrical
engineering joke. Alright.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.656
(Laughter)

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.416
Alright. So I'm going to go ahead
and tap the leaf here,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.815
and I want you to look
at the electrical recording

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:33.800
that we're going to see inside the plant.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.416
Whoa. It is so big,
I've got to scale it down.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.856
Alright. So what is that?

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.856
That is an action potential
that is happening inside the plant.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.136
Why was it happening?

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.776
Because it wanted to move. Right?

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.816
And so when I hit the touch receptors,

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.016
it sent a voltage all the way down
to the end of the stem,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.296
which caused it to move.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.576
And now, in our arms,
we would move our muscles,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.296
but the plant doesn't have muscles.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.576
What it has is water inside the cells

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.536
and when the voltage hits it,
it opens up, releases the water,

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.994
changes the shape of the cells,
and the leaf falls.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.416
OK. So here we see an action potential
encoding information to move. Alright?

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.936
But can it do more?

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.216
So let's go to find out.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.296
We're going to go to our good friend,
the Venus flytrap here,

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.736
and we're going to take a look
at what happens inside the leaf

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.696
when a fly lands on here.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.416
So I'm going to pretend
to be a fly right now.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.096
And now here's my Venus flytrap,

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.136
and inside the leaf,
you're going to notice

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.376
that there are three little hairs here,
and those are trigger hairs.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.776
And so when a fly lands --

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.296
I'm going to touch
one of the hairs right now.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.760
Ready? One, two, three.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.456
What do we get? We get
a beautiful action potential.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.000
However, the flytrap doesn't close.

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.096
And to understand why that is,

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.336
we need to know a little bit more
about the behavior of the flytrap.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.656
Number one is that it takes
a long time to open the traps back up --

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.856
you know, about 24 to 48 hours
if there's no fly inside of it.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.576
And so it takes a lot of energy.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.816
And two, it doesn't need to eat
that many flies throughout the year.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.496
Only a handful. It gets
most of its energy from the sun.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.736
It's just trying to replace
some nutrients in the ground with flies.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.016
And the third thing is,

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.016
it only opens then closes the traps
a handful of times

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.680
until that trap dies.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.816
So therefore, it wants
to make really darn sure

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.256
that there's a meal inside of it
before the flytrap snaps shut.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.480
So how does it do that?

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.896
It counts the number of seconds

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.136
between successive
touching of those hairs.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.576
And so the idea is
that there's a high probability,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.056
if there's a fly inside of there,
they're going to be quick together,

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.296
and so when it gets the first
action potential,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.736
it starts counting, one, two,

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.976
and if it gets to 20
and it doesn't fire again,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.416
then it's not going to close,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.296
but if it does it within there,
then the flytrap will close.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.776
So we're going to go back now.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.816
I'm going to touch
the Venus flytrap again.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.856
I've been talking
for more than 20 seconds.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.840
So we can see what happens
when I touch the hair a second time.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.176
So what do we get?
We get a second action potential,

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.096
but again, the leaf doesn't close.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.056
So now if I go back in there

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.976
and if I'm a fly moving around,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.176
I'm going to be touching
the leaf a few times.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.616
I'm going to go and brush it a few times.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.056
And immediately,

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.816
the flytrap closes.

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.976
So here we are seeing the flytrap
actually doing a computation.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.496
It's determining
if there's a fly inside the trap,

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.016
and then it closes.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.440
So let's go back to our original question.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.816
Do plants have brains?

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.416
Well, the answer is no.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.816
There's no brains in here.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.416
There's no axons, no neurons.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.816
It doesn't get depressed.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.216
It doesn't want to know
what the Tigers' score is.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.336
It doesn't have
self-actualization problems.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.776
But what it does have
is something that's very similar to us,

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.856
which is the ability
to communicate using electricity.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.136
It just uses slightly
different ions than we do,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.176
but it's actually doing the same thing.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.376
So just to show you

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.696
the ubiquitous nature
of these action potentials,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.936
we saw it in the Venus flytrap,

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.096
we've seen an action
potential in the mimosa.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.496
We've even seen
an action potential in a human.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.736
Now, this is the euro of the brain.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.896
It's the way that all
information is passed.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.736
And so what we can do
is we can use those action potentials

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.256
to pass information

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.016
between species of plants.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.456
And so this is our interspecies
plant-to-plant communicator,

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.656
and what we've done
is we've created a brand new experiment

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.216
where we're going to record
the action potential from a Venus flytrap,

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.016
and we're going to send it
into the sensitive mimosa.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.776
So I want you to recall what happens

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.736
when we touch the leaves of the mimosa.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.416
It has touch receptors
that are sending that information

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.536
back down in the form
of an action potential.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.896
And so what would happen

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.536
if we took the action potential
from the Venus flytrap

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.640
and sent it into
all the stems of the mimosa?

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.456
We should be able to create
the behavior of the mimosas

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.376
without actually touching it ourselves.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.416
And so if you'll allow me,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.895
I'm going to go ahead
and trigger this mimosa right now

00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:58.736
by touching on the hairs
of the Venus flytrap.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.360
So we're going to send information
about touch from one plant to another.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.336
So there you see it.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.576
So --

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:15.616
(Applause)

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.696
So I hope you learned a little bit,
something about plants today,

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.936
and not only that.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.976
You learned that plants could be used
to help teach neuroscience

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.736
and bring along the neurorevolution.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.976
Thank you.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.720
(Applause)
