00:00:06.837 --> 00:00:09.747
In the 1980s, a bonobo named Kanzi

00:00:09.747 --> 00:00:13.637
learned to communicate with humans
to an unprecedented extent—

00:00:13.637 --> 00:00:15.587
not through speech or gestures,

00:00:15.587 --> 00:00:20.798
but using a keyboard of abstract symbols
representing objects and actions.

00:00:20.798 --> 00:00:25.821
By pointing to several of these in order,
he created sequences to make requests,

00:00:25.821 --> 00:00:28.401
answer verbal questions 
from human researchers,

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:32.101
and refer to objects 
that weren’t physically present.

00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:37.041
Kanzi’s exploits ignited immediate 
controversy over one question:

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:40.151
had Kanzi learned language?

00:00:40.151 --> 00:00:43.851
What we call language is something 
more specific than communication.

00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:46.511
Language is about sharing 
what’s in our minds:

00:00:46.511 --> 00:00:49.871
stories, opinions, questions, 
the past or future,

00:00:49.871 --> 00:00:52.801
imagined times or places, ideas.

00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:54.811
It is fundamentally open-ended,

00:00:54.811 --> 00:00:59.005
and can be used to say 
an unlimited number of things.

00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:03.121
Many researchers are convinced 
that only humans have language,

00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:07.741
that the calls and gestures other species
use to communicate are not language.

00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:12.290
Each of these calls and gestures generally
corresponds to a specific message,

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.510
for a limited total number of messages

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.870
that aren’t combined 
into more complex ideas.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.280
For example, a monkey species 
might have a specific warning call

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.550
that corresponds to a particular predator,
like a snake—

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.459
but with language, there are countless 
ways to say “watch out for the snake.”

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:33.404
So far no animal communication seems 
to have the open-endedness

00:01:33.404 --> 00:01:34.724
of human language.

00:01:34.724 --> 00:01:37.574
We don’t know for sure what’s going
on in animals’ heads,

00:01:37.574 --> 00:01:40.053
and it's possible this definition 
of language,

00:01:40.053 --> 00:01:43.103
or our ways of measuring it,
don’t apply to them.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:46.593
But as far as we know, 
only humans have language.

00:01:46.593 --> 00:01:50.593
And while humans speak 
around 7,000 distinct languages,

00:01:50.593 --> 00:01:53.323
any child can learn any language,

00:01:53.323 --> 00:01:56.813
indicating that the biological machinery
underlying language

00:01:56.813 --> 00:01:59.003
is common to all of us.

00:01:59.003 --> 00:02:01.663
So what does language mean for humanity?

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:05.931
What does it allow us to do, 
and how did we come to have it?

00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:10.210
Exactly when we acquired this capacity
is still an open question.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.720
Chimps and bonobos 
are our closest living relatives,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.870
but the lineage leading to humans 
split from the other great apes

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.580
more than four million years ago.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.350
In between, there were many species—
all of them now extinct,

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.167
which makes it very difficult to know
if they had language or anything like it.

00:02:29.167 --> 00:02:33.277
Great apes give one potential clue 
to the origins of language, though:

00:02:33.277 --> 00:02:37.277
it may have started as gesture 
rather than speech.

00:02:37.277 --> 00:02:40.662
Great apes gesture to each other 
in the wild much more freely

00:02:40.662 --> 00:02:42.622
than they vocalize.

00:02:42.622 --> 00:02:46.072
Language may have begun to take shape
during the Pleistocene,

00:02:46.072 --> 00:02:50.314
2 to 3 million years ago, 
with the emergence of the genus Homo

00:02:50.314 --> 00:02:54.509
that eventually gave rise 
to our own species, homo sapiens.

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:59.347
Brain size tripled, and bipedalism 
freed the hands for communication.

00:02:59.347 --> 00:03:02.497
There may have been a transition 
from gestural communication

00:03:02.497 --> 00:03:04.060
to gestural language—

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.060
from pointing to objects 
and pantomiming actions—

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.353
to more efficient, abstract signing.

00:03:10.353 --> 00:03:15.384
The abstraction of gestural communication
would have removed the need for visuals,

00:03:15.384 --> 00:03:18.394
setting the stage for a transition 
to spoken language.

00:03:18.394 --> 00:03:21.484
That transition would have 
likely come later, though.

00:03:21.484 --> 00:03:25.956
Articulate speech depends 
on a vocal tract of a particular shape.

00:03:25.956 --> 00:03:30.356
Even our closest ancestors, 
the Neanderthals and Denisovans,

00:03:30.356 --> 00:03:32.716
had vocal tracts that were not optimal,

00:03:32.716 --> 00:03:34.986
though they likely had 
some vocal capacity,

00:03:34.986 --> 00:03:36.976
and possibly even language.

00:03:36.976 --> 00:03:40.156
Only in humans is the vocal tract optimal.

00:03:40.156 --> 00:03:45.544
Spoken words free the hands for activities
such as tool use and transport.

00:03:45.544 --> 00:03:48.074
So it may have been 
the emergence of speech,

00:03:48.074 --> 00:03:52.394
not of language itself, that led 
to the dominance of our species.

00:03:52.394 --> 00:03:57.894
Language is so intimately tied to complex
thought, perception, and motor functions

00:03:57.894 --> 00:04:01.998
that it’s difficult to untangle
its biological origins.

00:04:01.998 --> 00:04:04.448
Some of the biggest mysteries remain:

00:04:04.448 --> 00:04:08.178
to what extent did language 
as a capacity shape humanity,

00:04:08.178 --> 00:04:11.338
and to what extent did humanity 
shape language?

00:04:11.338 --> 00:04:15.638
What came first, the vast number 
of possible scenarios we can envisage,

00:04:15.638 --> 00:04:17.788
or our ability to share them?
