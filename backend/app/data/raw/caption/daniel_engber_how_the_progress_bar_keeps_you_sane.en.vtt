00:00:12.103 --> 00:00:14.477
How many people are bored at their desk

00:00:14.501 --> 00:00:16.019
for how many hours every day

00:00:16.043 --> 00:00:18.393
and how many days a week
and how many weeks a year

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:19.995
for how many years in their life?

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.604
[Small thing. Big idea.]

00:00:22.629 --> 00:00:24.629
[Daniel Engber on
the Progress Bar]

00:00:25.165 --> 00:00:27.857
The progress bar is just
an indicator on a computer

00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:30.907
that something's happening
inside the device.

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.111
The classic one that's been used
for years is a horizontal bar.

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:39.976
I mean, this goes back
to pre-computer versions of this

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.314
on ledgers, where people would fill in
a horizontal bar from left to right

00:00:44.338 --> 00:00:47.954
to show how much of a task
they had completed at a factory.

00:00:47.978 --> 00:00:50.154
This is just the same thing on a screen.

00:00:50.497 --> 00:00:51.985
Something happened in the 70s

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:54.773
that is sometimes referred
to as "the software crisis,"

00:00:54.797 --> 00:00:57.705
where suddenly, computers
were getting more complicated

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:01.007
more quickly than anyone
had been prepared for,

00:01:01.031 --> 00:01:02.817
from a design perspective.

00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:07.150
People were using percent-done
indicators in different ways.

00:01:07.174 --> 00:01:09.819
So you might have a graphical
countdown clock,

00:01:09.843 --> 00:01:12.638
or they would have a line of asterisks

00:01:12.662 --> 00:01:15.057
that would fill out
from left to right on a screen.

00:01:15.081 --> 00:01:18.674
But no one had done
a systematic survey of these things

00:01:18.698 --> 00:01:19.881
and tried to figure out:

00:01:19.905 --> 00:01:23.016
How do they actually affect
the user's experience

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.367
of sitting at the computer?

00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:26.341
This graduate student named Brad Myers,

00:01:26.365 --> 00:01:29.599
in 1985, decided he would study this.

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:31.676
He found that it didn't really matter

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.806
if the percent-done indicator
was giving you the accurate percent done.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.560
What mattered was
that it was there at all.

00:01:39.584 --> 00:01:42.188
Just seeing it there
made people feel better,

00:01:42.212 --> 00:01:44.901
and that was the most surprising thing.

00:01:44.925 --> 00:01:47.844
He has all these ideas
about what this thing could do.

00:01:47.868 --> 00:01:51.954
Maybe it could make people
relax effectively.

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:56.648
Maybe it would allow people
to turn away from their machine

00:01:56.672 --> 00:01:59.735
and do something else
of exactly the right duration.

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.640
They would look and say,
"Oh, the progress bar is half done.

00:02:02.664 --> 00:02:03.815
That took five minutes.

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:07.736
So now I have five minutes
to send this fax,"

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.124
or whatever people were doing in 1985.

00:02:10.148 --> 00:02:11.952
Both of those things are wrong.

00:02:11.976 --> 00:02:13.842
Like, when you see that progress bar,

00:02:13.866 --> 00:02:16.833
it sort of locks your attention
in a tractor beam,

00:02:16.857 --> 00:02:18.873
and it turns the experience of waiting

00:02:18.897 --> 00:02:23.979
into this exciting narrative
that you're seeing unfold in front of you:

00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:27.852
that somehow, this time you've spent
waiting in frustration

00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:29.511
for the computer to do something,

00:02:29.535 --> 00:02:31.510
has been reconceptualized as:

00:02:31.535 --> 00:02:33.829
"Progress! Oh! Great stuff is happening!"

00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:35.991
[Progress...]

00:02:36.015 --> 00:02:39.230
But once you start thinking
about the progress bar

00:02:39.254 --> 00:02:42.599
as something that's more
about dulling the pain of waiting,

00:02:42.623 --> 00:02:46.506
well, then you can start fiddling
around with the psychology.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.578
So if you have a progress bar
that just moves at a constant rate --

00:02:50.602 --> 00:02:53.578
let's say, that's really
what's happening in the computer --

00:02:53.602 --> 00:02:56.859
that will feel to people
like it's slowing down.

00:02:57.668 --> 00:02:58.954
We get bored.

00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:02.109
Well, now you can start
trying to enhance it

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:04.895
and make it appear to move
more quickly than it really is,

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:08.626
make it move faster at the beginning,
like a burst of speed.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.994
That's exciting, people feel like,
"Oh! Something's really happening!"

00:03:12.018 --> 00:03:16.047
Then you can move back into a more
naturalistic growth of the progress bar

00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:17.382
as you go along.

00:03:17.406 --> 00:03:20.600
You're assuming that people are focusing
on the passage of time --

00:03:20.624 --> 00:03:22.327
they're trying to watch grass grow,

00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:25.331
they're trying to watch a pot of water,
waiting for it to boil,

00:03:25.355 --> 00:03:27.747
and you're just trying
to make that less boring,

00:03:27.771 --> 00:03:29.997
less painful and less frustrating

00:03:30.021 --> 00:03:31.347
than it was before.

00:03:31.371 --> 00:03:34.372
So the progress bar at least gives you

00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:36.857
the vision of a beginning and an end,

00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:38.575
and you're working towards a goal.

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.552
I think in some ways,
it mitigates the fear of death.

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.190
Too much?
