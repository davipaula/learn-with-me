00:00:15.108 --> 00:00:19.085
Why are gas stations always built
right next to other gas stations?

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.815
Why can I drive for a mile
without finding a coffee shop

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.143
and then stumble
across three on the same corner?

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:27.051
Why do grocery stores,
auto repair shops and restaurants

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:28.718
always seem to exist in groups

00:00:28.742 --> 00:00:31.901
instead of being spread evenly
throughout a community?

00:00:31.925 --> 00:00:33.456
While there are several factors

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.164
that might go into deciding
where to place your business,

00:00:36.188 --> 00:00:39.796
clusters of similar companies can
be explained by a very simple story

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.292
called Hotelling's Model
of Spatial Competition.

00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:45.217
Imagine that you sell
ice cream at the beach.

00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:48.051
Your beach is one mile long
and you have no competition.

00:00:48.075 --> 00:00:51.269
Where would you place your cart
in order to sell the most product?

00:00:51.293 --> 00:00:52.368
In the middle.

00:00:52.392 --> 00:00:55.418
The one-half-mile walk may
be too far for some people

00:00:55.442 --> 00:00:56.741
at each end of the beach,

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:59.770
but your cart serves
as many people as possible.

00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:01.118
One day you show up at work

00:01:01.142 --> 00:01:03.522
just as your cousin Teddy
is arriving at the beach

00:01:03.546 --> 00:01:04.900
with his own ice cream cart.

00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:06.317
In fact, he's selling

00:01:06.341 --> 00:01:08.516
exactly the same type
of ice cream as you are.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.793
You agree that you will split
the beach in half.

00:01:10.817 --> 00:01:13.634
In order to ensure that customers
don't have to walk too far

00:01:13.658 --> 00:01:16.572
you set up your cart a quarter mile
south of the beach center,

00:01:16.596 --> 00:01:18.412
right in the middle of your territory.

00:01:18.436 --> 00:01:20.751
Teddy sets up a quarter mile
north of the center,

00:01:20.775 --> 00:01:22.768
in the middle of Teddy territory.

00:01:22.792 --> 00:01:25.935
With this agreement, everyone south
of you buys ice cream from you.

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:29.489
Everyone north of Teddy buys from him,
and the 50% of beachgoers in between

00:01:29.513 --> 00:01:31.172
walk to the closest cart.

00:01:31.196 --> 00:01:33.751
No one walks
more than a quarter of a mile,

00:01:33.775 --> 00:01:36.653
and both vendors sell
to half of the beachgoers.

00:01:36.677 --> 00:01:40.836
Game theorists consider
this a socially optimal solution.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.352
It minimizes the maximum number
of steps any visitor must take

00:01:44.376 --> 00:01:46.352
in order to reach an ice cream cart.

00:01:46.376 --> 00:01:48.235
The next day, when you arrive at work,

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.034
Teddy has set up his cart
in the middle of the beach.

00:01:51.058 --> 00:01:54.301
You return to your location
a quarter mile south of center

00:01:54.325 --> 00:01:57.069
and get the 25% of customers
to the south of you.

00:01:57.093 --> 00:02:00.635
Teddy still gets all of the customers
north in Teddy territory,

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.702
but now you split the 25% of people
in between the two carts.

00:02:04.726 --> 00:02:07.584
Day three of the ice cream wars,
you get to the beach early,

00:02:07.608 --> 00:02:10.167
and set up right in the center
of Teddy territory,

00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:13.632
assuming you'll serve
the 75% of beachgoers to your south,

00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:17.026
leaving your cousin to sell
to the 25% of customers to the north.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.520
When Teddy arrives,
he sets up just south of you

00:02:20.544 --> 00:02:22.451
stealing all of the southerly customers,

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:25.259
and leaving you with a small group
of people to the north.

00:02:25.283 --> 00:02:29.336
Not to be outdone, you move 10 paces
south of Teddy to regain your customers.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.836
When you take a mid-day break,
Teddy shuffles 10 paces south of you,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.535
and again, steals back all the customers
to the far end of the beach.

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:38.134
Throughout the course of the day,

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.417
both of you continue
to periodically move south

00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:42.836
towards the bulk of the ice cream buyers,

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.860
until both of you eventually end up
at the center of the beach,

00:02:45.884 --> 00:02:49.719
back to back, each serving 50%
of the ice-cream-hungry beachgoers.

00:02:49.743 --> 00:02:51.935
At this point, you
and your competitive cousin

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.951
have reached what game theorists
call a Nash Equilibrium -

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:57.774
the point where neither of you
can improve your position

00:02:57.798 --> 00:02:59.937
by deviating from your current strategy.

00:02:59.961 --> 00:03:01.398
Your original strategy,

00:03:01.422 --> 00:03:04.446
where you were each a quarter mile
from the middle of the beach,

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.086
didn't last, because it wasn't
a Nash Equilibrium.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.936
Either of you could move your cart
towards the other to sell more ice cream.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.246
With both of you now
in the center of the beach,

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.902
you can't reposition your cart
closer to your furthest customers

00:03:16.926 --> 00:03:19.212
without making your current
customers worse off.

00:03:19.236 --> 00:03:22.568
However, you no longer have
a socially optimal solution,

00:03:22.592 --> 00:03:24.592
since customers at either end of the beach

00:03:24.616 --> 00:03:27.602
have to walk further than necessary
to get a sweet treat.

00:03:27.626 --> 00:03:29.570
Think about all the fast food chains,

00:03:29.594 --> 00:03:32.271
clothing boutiques,
or mobile phone kiosks at the mall.

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:33.879
Customers may be better served

00:03:33.903 --> 00:03:36.164
by distributing services
throughout a community,

00:03:36.188 --> 00:03:39.520
but this leaves businesses vulnerable
to aggressive competition.

00:03:39.544 --> 00:03:42.786
In the real world, customers come
from more than one direction,

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.715
and businesses are free to compete
with marketing strategies,

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.501
by differentiating their product line,
and with price cuts,

00:03:48.525 --> 00:03:50.252
but at the heart of their strategy,

00:03:50.276 --> 00:03:53.621
companies like to keep their competition
as close as possible.
