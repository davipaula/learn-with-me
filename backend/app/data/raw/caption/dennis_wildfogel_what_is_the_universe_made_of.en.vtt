00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:08.769
All the material objects around you

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:10.395
are composed of submicroscopic units

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:12.146
we call molecules.

00:00:12.146 --> 00:00:13.398
And molecules in turn are composed

00:00:13.398 --> 00:00:15.146
of individual atoms.

00:00:15.146 --> 00:00:16.980
Molecules frequently break apart

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.063
and then form new molecules.

00:00:19.063 --> 00:00:20.313
On the other hand,

00:00:20.313 --> 00:00:22.248
virtually all the atoms you come in to contact with

00:00:22.248 --> 00:00:23.813
through the course of your life,

00:00:23.813 --> 00:00:25.417
the ones in the ground beneath you,

00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:27.419
the air you breath, the food you eat,

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.712
those that make up every living thing, including you,

00:00:29.712 --> 00:00:31.900
have existed for billions of years

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.882
and were created in places very unlike our planet.

00:00:34.882 --> 00:00:38.349
How those atoms came about is what I want to share with you.

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:39.933
It all started 14 billion years ago

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.685
with an event we call The Big Bang,

00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:44.856
which resulted in a universe consisting of gas alone.

00:00:44.856 --> 00:00:46.896
There were no stars and no planets.

00:00:46.896 --> 00:00:48.480
The gas was made up only of atoms

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.479
belonging to the simplest elements.

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.313
It was about 75 percent hydrogen

00:00:52.313 --> 00:00:54.396
and almost all the rest was helium.

00:00:54.396 --> 00:00:57.314
No elements like carbon, oxygen or nitrogen existed.

00:00:57.314 --> 00:00:59.396
No iron, silver or gold.

00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:03.146
In some places, the density of this gas was slightly higher than in others.

00:01:03.165 --> 00:01:05.981
Due to gravity, those places attracted even more gas,

00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:07.980
which further strengthened the pull of gravity,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.670
which then drew more gas in, and so on.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.507
Eventually, large dense gas balls formed,

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:15.312
shrinking under their own gravity

00:01:15.312 --> 00:01:18.055
and consequently heating up on the inside.

00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:19.645
At some point, the core of such a ball

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:22.147
gets hot enough that nuclear fusion occurs.

00:01:22.147 --> 00:01:24.896
Hydrogen atoms smash together to form helium,

00:01:24.896 --> 00:01:27.063
accompanied by a great release of energy,

00:01:27.063 --> 00:01:30.564
strong enough to counteract the shrinking force of the gravity.

00:01:30.564 --> 00:01:32.563
When the energy pushing out from the fusion reactions

00:01:32.563 --> 00:01:35.113
matches the gravity pulling all the gas inwards,

00:01:35.113 --> 00:01:37.063
an equilibrium occurs.

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:39.369
From this a star is born.

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.367
Over its lifetime,

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:42.480
the fusion reactions in the core of a massive star

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.064
will produce not only helium,

00:01:44.064 --> 00:01:46.206
but also carbon, oxygen, nitrogen

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:50.125
and all the other elements in the periodic table up to iron.

00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:52.146
But eventually, the core's fuel runs out,

00:01:52.146 --> 00:01:54.089
leaving it to collapse completely.

00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:56.257
That causes an unbelievably powerful explosion

00:01:56.257 --> 00:01:58.480
we call a supernova.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.595
Now there are two things to note

00:01:59.595 --> 00:02:01.563
about how supernovas create elements.

00:02:01.563 --> 00:02:04.310
First, this explosion releases so much energy

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.935
that fusion goes wild

00:02:05.935 --> 00:02:08.564
forming elements with atoms even heavier than iron

00:02:08.564 --> 00:02:10.897
like silver, gold and uranium.

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:12.730
Second, all the elements that had been accumulating

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.145
in the core of the star,

00:02:14.145 --> 00:02:16.695
like carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron,

00:02:16.695 --> 00:02:19.561
as well as all of those formed in the supernova explosion,

00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:21.981
are ejected in to interstellar space

00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:24.397
where they mix with the gas that's already there.

00:02:24.397 --> 00:02:26.480
History then repeats itself.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.667
Gas clouds, now containing many elements

00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:31.083
besides the original hydrogen and helium,

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:32.548
have higher density areas

00:02:32.548 --> 00:02:34.672
that attract more matter, and so on.

00:02:34.672 --> 00:02:37.548
As before, new stars result.

00:02:37.548 --> 00:02:40.302
Our sun was born this way about 5 billion years ago.

00:02:40.302 --> 00:02:42.231
That means that the gas it arose from

00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:44.266
had itself been enriched with many elements

00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:47.980
from supernova explosions since the universe began.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.646
So that's how the sun wound up with all the elements.

00:02:50.646 --> 00:02:52.862
It's still mostly hydrogen at 71 percent,

00:02:52.862 --> 00:02:55.565
with most of the rest being helium at 27 percent.

00:02:55.565 --> 00:02:56.483
But bear in mind

00:02:56.498 --> 00:02:57.813
that while the first stars were made up

00:02:57.813 --> 00:02:59.647
of hydrogen and helium alone,

00:02:59.647 --> 00:03:01.481
the remaining elements in the periodic table

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.731
make up two percent of the sun.

00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:05.146
And what about Earth?

00:03:05.146 --> 00:03:07.997
Planets form as an incidental process to star formation

00:03:07.997 --> 00:03:11.126
out of the same gas cloud as the star itself.

00:03:11.126 --> 00:03:13.042
Small planets like ours don't have enough gravity

00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:15.587
to hold on to much hydrogen or helium gas

00:03:15.587 --> 00:03:17.672
since both of those are very light.

00:03:17.672 --> 00:03:20.312
So, even though carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and so on

00:03:20.312 --> 00:03:23.731
made up only two percent of the gas cloud from which Earth was formed,

00:03:23.731 --> 00:03:26.307
these heavier elements form the bulk of our planet

00:03:26.307 --> 00:03:28.266
and everything on it.

00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:29.518
Think about this:

00:03:29.518 --> 00:03:31.645
with the exception of hydrogen and some helium,

00:03:31.645 --> 00:03:33.145
the ground you walk on,

00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:35.230
the air you breath, you,

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.813
everything is made of atoms

00:03:36.813 --> 00:03:38.731
that were created inside stars.

00:03:38.731 --> 00:03:40.813
When scientists first worked this out

00:03:40.813 --> 00:03:42.731
over the first half of the 20th Century,

00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:45.033
the famous astronomer Harlow Shapley commented,

00:03:45.033 --> 00:03:48.620
"We are brothers of the boulders, cousins of the clouds."
