00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.560
My mother was a philanthropist.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.176
And now I know you're asking --

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.736
let me give you the answer:
yes, a little bit like Melinda Gates --

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.976
(Laughter)

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.936
but with a lot less money.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.440
(Laughter)

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.776
She carried out her philanthropy
in our community

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.400
through a practice we call, "isirika."

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.216
She supported the education
of scores of children

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.176
and invited many
to live with us in our home

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.760
in order to access schools.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.720
She mobilized resources
for building the local health clinic

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.080
and the maternity wing
is named in memory of her.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.576
But most important,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.760
she was endeared by the community
for her organizing skills,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.056
because she organized the community,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.176
and specifically women,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.296
to find solutions

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.320
to anything that was needed.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.200
She did all of this through isirika.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.656
Let me repeat that word for you again:

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.896
isirika.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.776
Now it's your turn. Say it with me.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.136
(Audience) Isirika.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.656
Musimbi Kanyoro: Thank you.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.856
That word is in my language, Maragoli,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.656
spoken in western Kenya,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.456
and now you speak my language.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.816
(Laughter)

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.016
So, isirika is a pragmatic way of life

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.976
that embraces charity,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.256
services

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.440
and philanthropy all together.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.240
The essence of isirika

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.416
is to make it clear to everybody

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.616
that you're your sister's keeper --

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.936
and yes,

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.720
you're your brother's keeper.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.800
Mutual responsibility
for caring for one another.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.856
A literal, simple English translation
would be equal generosity,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.376
but the deep philosophical meaning

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.000
is caring, together, for one another.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.840
So how does isirika really happen?

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.136
I grew up in a farming community

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.560
in western Kenya.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.456
I remember vividly the many times

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.776
that neighbors would go
to a neighbor's home --

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.376
a sick neighbor's home --

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.160
and harvest their crop for them.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.056
I tagged alongside with my mother
to community events

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.056
and to women's events,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.056
and had the conversation
about vaccinations in school,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.816
building the health center

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.096
and really big things --

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.320
renewing seeds for the next
planting season.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.896
And often, the community
would come together

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.136
to contribute money
to send a neighbor's child to school --

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.256
not only in the country

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.680
but to universities abroad as well.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.000
And so we have a surgeon.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.616
The first surgeon in my country
came from that rural village.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.696
(Applause)

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.416
So ...

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.296
what isirika did was to be inclusive.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.376
We as children would stand
alongside the adults

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.736
and give our contributions of money,

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.176
and our names were inscripted
in the community book

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.320
just like every adult.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.136
And then I grew up,

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.376
went to universities
back at home and abroad,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.336
obtained a few degrees here and there,

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.176
became organized

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.416
and took up international jobs,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.536
working in development,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.456
humanitarian work

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.720
and philanthropy.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.120
And very soon,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.200
isirika began to become small.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.536
It dissipated

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.080
and then just disappeared.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.336
In each place,

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.296
I gained a new vocabulary.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.760
The vocabulary of donors and recipients.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.456
The vocabulary of measuring impact,

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.320
return on investment ...

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.360
projects and programs.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.576
Communities such as my childhood community

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.520
became referred to
as "poor, vulnerable populations."

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.016
Those are the communities
of which literature speaks about

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.976
as living on less than a dollar a day,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.176
and they become the targets
for poverty eradication programs.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.496
And by the way,

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.176
they are the targets of our first

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.760
United Nations'
sustainable development goal.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.776
Now, I'm really interested

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.296
that we find solutions to poverty

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.056
and to the world's other many big problems

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.440
because they do exist.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.216
I however think
that we could do a better job,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.456
and we could do a better job
by embracing isirika.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.000
So let me tell you how.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.000
First, isirika affirms common humanity.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.296
For whatever that you do,

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.880
you begin from the premise
that you're human together.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.896
When you begin that you're human together,

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.240
you see each other differently.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.776
You don't see a refugee first

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.416
and you don't see a woman first

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.656
and you don't see
a person with disability first.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.576
You see a human being first.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.896
That is the essence
of seeing a person first.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.776
And when you do that,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.016
you value their ideas,

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.896
you value their contribution --

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.400
small or big.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.080
And you value what
they bring to the table.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.840
That is the essence of isirika.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.016
I just want to imagine
what it would look like

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.896
if everyone in this room --

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.856
a medical doctor, a parent,

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.600
a lawyer, a philanthropist,

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.496
whatever you are --

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.616
if you embraced isirika

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.240
and made it your default.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.216
What could we achieve for each other?

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.880
What could we achieve for humanity?

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.056
What could we achieve for peace issues?

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.120
What could we achieve for medical science?

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.296
Let me give you a couple of hints,

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.016
because I'm going to ask you
to accompany me

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.840
in this process of rebuilding
and reclaiming isirika with me.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.160
First, you have to have faith

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.336
that we are one humanity,

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.376
we have one planet

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.656
and we don't have two choices about that.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.336
So there's not going to be a wall
that is high enough

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.936
to separate humanity.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.776
So give up the walls.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.056
Give them up.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.816
(Applause)

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.216
And we don't have a planet B to go to.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.976
So that's really important.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.416
Make that clear;

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.976
move onto the next stage.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.160
The second stage: remember,

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.160
in isirika, every idea counts.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.976
Bridges have big posters

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.760
and they have nails.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.016
Every idea counts --

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.480
small or big counts.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.736
And third,

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.056
isirika affirms

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:59.160
that those who have more
really enjoy the privilege of giving more.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.976
It is a privilege to give more.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.176
(Applause)

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:09.856
And this is the time
for women to give more for women.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.320
It is the time to give more for women.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:18.296
Our parents, when they brought in
other children to live with us,

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.200
they didn't ask our permission.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.256
They made it clear
that they had a responsibility

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.696
because they had gone to school

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.360
and they had an earning.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.616
And they made it clear
that we should understand

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:36.496
that their prosperity
was not our entitlement,

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.296
and I think that's good
wisdom from isirika.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.296
We could use that wisdom today,
I think, in every culture,

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.520
in every place,

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.320
passing to the next generation
what we could do together.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.535
I have,

00:08:53.559 --> 00:08:55.135
over the years,

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:58.080
encountered isirika in many places,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.576
but what gives me really the passion today

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.416
to embrace isirika

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.736
is the work that I do
with women all over the world

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.016
through the Global Fund for Women,

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.496
though women's funds

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.240
and through women's movements globally.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.456
If you work with women,

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.656
you change every day

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.640
because you experience them living
isirika together in what they do.

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.416
In the work that I do,

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.120
we trust women leaders and their ideas.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:36.056
And we support them with funding
so that they can expand,

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.576
they can grow

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.960
and they can thrive
within their own communities.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:47.736
A woman in 1990 came
to the Global Fund with a big idea --

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.616
a woman from Mexico
by the name of Lucero González.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.576
She wanted to begin a fund
that would support a movement

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.496
that would be rooted
in the communities in Mexico.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:05.680
And she received a grant
of 7,500 US dollars.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.720
Today, 25 years later,

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.016
Semillas, the name of the fund,

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.376
has raised and spent,

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.016
within the community,

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.576
17.8 million dollars.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:23.416
(Applause)

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:30.256
They have impacted
over two million people,

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:36.080
and they work with a group
of 600,000 women in Mexico.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.840
During the recent earthquake,

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.096
they were so well rooted

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:47.976
that they could quickly assess
within the community and with others,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.536
what were the short-term needs
and what were the long-term needs.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.136
And I tell you,

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.896
long after the lights
have gone off Mexico,

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.376
Semillas will be there

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.896
with the communities, with the women,

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.896
for a very long time.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.296
And that's what I'm talking about:

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:11.896
when we are able to support
the ideas of communities

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.960
that are rooted within their own setting.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.960
Thirty years ago,

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:23.296
there was very little funding
that went directly to women's hands

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.840
in their communities.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:31.576
Today we celebrate 168 women's funds

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.936
all over the world,

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.600
100 of which are in this country.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.136
And they support --

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.816
(Applause)

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.800
they support grassroots
women's organizations --

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:49.256
community organizations
under the leadership of girls and women,

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.816
and together we have been able,

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.056
collectively,

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:58.696
to give a billion dollars
to women and girls-led organizations.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.856
(Applause)

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.120
But the challenge begins today.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.616
The challenge begins today

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:15.136
because we see women everywhere
organizing as isirika,

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.840
including women
organizing as isirika in TED.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.720
Because isirika is the evergreen wisdom
that lives in communities.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.256
You find it in indigenous communities,

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.880
in rural communities.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.976
And what it really ingrains in people

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.016
is that ability to trust

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.400
and to move the agenda ahead.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.856
So, three things that I have learned
that I want to share with you

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.376
through my work.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:54.656
One: if you want to solve
the world's biggest problems,

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.896
invest in women and girls.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:03.216
(Applause)

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.256
Not only do they expand the investment,

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:08.656
but they care for everyone
in the community.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.576
Not only their needs
but the needs of their children,

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.656
the needs of the rest of the community,

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.536
the needs of the elderly,

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:18.296
and most important,

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.096
they protect themselves --

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.976
which is really important --

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.720
and they protect their communities.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.976
Women who know how to protect themselves

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.720
know what it means to make a difference.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:36.256
And the second reason that I'm asking
you to invest in women and girls

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.856
is because this is the smartest
thing you could ever do

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.696
at this particular time.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.256
And if we are going to have

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.536
over 350 trillion dollars

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.096
by 2030,

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.376
those dollars need to be
in the hands of women.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.216
And so I grew up with isirika.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.976
My mother was isirika.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.080
She was not a project or a program.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.936
And now, I pass that to you.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.096
That you will be able
to share this with your families,

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.576
with your friends

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.376
and with your community,

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.896
and embrace isirika as a way of living --

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.216
as a pragmatic way of living.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.456
Thank you.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.256
(Applause)

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.496
Thank you.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.776
(Applause)

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.016
Thank you.

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.640
(Applause)
