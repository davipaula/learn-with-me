00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:09.708
You hear the gentle lap of waves,

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:11.913
the distant cawing of a seagull.

00:00:11.913 --> 00:00:15.820
But then an annoying whine
interrupts the peace,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.459
getting closer, and closer, and closer.

00:00:19.459 --> 00:00:21.568
Until...whack!

00:00:21.568 --> 00:00:26.617
You dispatch the offending mosquito, 
and calm is restored.

00:00:26.617 --> 00:00:31.730
How did you detect that noise from afar
and target its maker with such precision?

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.466
The ability to recognize sounds 
and identify their location

00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:38.518
is possible thanks to the auditory system.

00:00:38.518 --> 00:00:43.160
That’s comprised of two main parts: 
the ear and the brain.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.374
The ear’s task is to convert sound energy
into neural signals;

00:00:47.374 --> 00:00:52.079
the brain’s is to receive and process 
the information those signals contain.

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.898
To understand how that works,

00:00:53.898 --> 00:00:57.547
we can follow a sound 
on its journey into the ear.

00:00:57.547 --> 00:00:59.621
The source of a sound creates vibrations

00:00:59.621 --> 00:01:03.323
that travel as waves of pressure 
through particles in air,

00:01:03.323 --> 00:01:04.221
liquids,

00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:05.725
or solids.

00:01:05.725 --> 00:01:07.986
But our inner ear, called the cochlea,

00:01:07.986 --> 00:01:11.966
is actually filled 
with saltwater-like fluids.

00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:15.852
So, the first problem to solve 
is how to convert those sound waves,

00:01:15.852 --> 00:01:17.532
wherever they’re coming from,

00:01:17.532 --> 00:01:20.249
into waves in the fluid.

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:23.833
The solution is the eardrum, 
or tympanic membrane,

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:27.230
and the tiny bones of the middle ear.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.170
Those convert the large movements 
of the eardrum

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.928
into pressure waves 
in the fluid of the cochlea.

00:01:33.928 --> 00:01:35.986
When sound enters the ear canal,

00:01:35.986 --> 00:01:40.013
it hits the eardrum and makes it vibrate 
like the head of a drum.

00:01:40.013 --> 00:01:43.939
The vibrating eardrum jerks a bone 
called the hammer,

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.677
which hits the anvil and
moves the third bone called the stapes.

00:01:48.677 --> 00:01:53.042
Its motion pushes the fluid 
within the long chambers of the cochlea.

00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:54.389
Once there,

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:59.179
the sound vibrations have finally
been converted into vibrations of a fluid,

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.204
and they travel like a wave 
from one end of the cochlea to the other.

00:02:03.204 --> 00:02:07.793
A surface called the basilar membrane 
runs the length of the cochlea.

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:11.803
It’s lined with hair cells that have 
specialized components

00:02:11.803 --> 00:02:13.536
called stereocilia,

00:02:13.536 --> 00:02:17.936
which move with the vibrations of the
cochlear fluid and the basilar membrane.

00:02:17.936 --> 00:02:22.265
This movement triggers a signal 
that travels through the hair cell,

00:02:22.265 --> 00:02:24.154
into the auditory nerve,

00:02:24.154 --> 00:02:28.301
then onward to the brain, 
which interprets it as a specific sound.

00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:31.720
When a sound makes 
the basilar membrane vibrate,

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.369
not every hair cell moves -

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:39.244
only selected ones, 
depending on the frequency of the sound.

00:02:39.244 --> 00:02:41.715
This comes down to some fine engineering.

00:02:41.715 --> 00:02:45.438
At one end, 
the basilar membrane is stiff,

00:02:45.438 --> 00:02:50.926
vibrating only in response to short
wavelength, high-frequency sounds.

00:02:50.926 --> 00:02:52.745
The other is more flexible,

00:02:52.745 --> 00:02:57.513
vibrating only in the presence of longer
wavelength, low-frequency sounds.

00:02:57.513 --> 00:03:00.461
So, the noises made by the seagull 
and mosquito

00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:03.537
vibrate different locations 
on the basilar membrane,

00:03:03.537 --> 00:03:06.751
like playing different keys on a piano.

00:03:06.751 --> 00:03:08.663
But that’s not all that’s going on.

00:03:08.663 --> 00:03:12.639
The brain still has another 
important task to fulfill:

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.576
identifying where a sound is coming from.

00:03:15.576 --> 00:03:19.613
For that, it compares the sounds 
coming into the two ears

00:03:19.613 --> 00:03:22.126
to locate the source in space.

00:03:22.126 --> 00:03:26.950
A sound from directly in front of you will
reach both your ears at the same time.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.744
You’ll also hear it at the same intensity 
in each ear.

00:03:30.744 --> 00:03:34.305
However, a low-frequency sound 
coming from one side

00:03:34.305 --> 00:03:38.847
will reach the near ear microseconds 
before the far one.

00:03:38.847 --> 00:03:42.775
And high-frequency sounds will sound
more intense to the near ear

00:03:42.775 --> 00:03:46.010
because they’re blocked 
from the far ear by your head.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.765
These strands of information 
reach special parts of the brainstem

00:03:49.765 --> 00:03:54.124
that analyze time and
intensity differences between your ears.

00:03:54.124 --> 00:03:58.747
They send the results of their 
analysis up to the auditory cortex.

00:03:58.747 --> 00:04:01.733
Now, the brain has 
all the information it needs:

00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:04.539
the patterns of activity 
that tell us what the sound is,

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:08.433
and information about 
where it is in space.

00:04:08.433 --> 00:04:10.604
Not everyone has normal hearing.

00:04:10.604 --> 00:04:15.049
Hearing loss is the third most common 
chronic disease in the world.

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.115
Exposure to loud noises 
and some drugs can kill hair cells,

00:04:19.115 --> 00:04:23.012
preventing signals from traveling 
from the ear to the brain.

00:04:23.012 --> 00:04:27.671
Diseases like osteosclerosis freeze 
the tiny bones in the ear

00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:29.841
so they no longer vibrate.

00:04:29.841 --> 00:04:31.305
And with tinnitus,

00:04:31.305 --> 00:04:32.964
the brain does strange things

00:04:32.964 --> 00:04:36.672
to make us think there’s a sound 
when there isn’t one.

00:04:36.672 --> 00:04:38.208
But when it does work,

00:04:38.208 --> 00:04:40.970
our hearing is an incredible, 
elegant system.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.723
Our ears enclose a fine-tuned piece 
of biological machinery

00:04:44.723 --> 00:04:48.397
that converts the cacophony of vibrations 
in the air around us

00:04:48.397 --> 00:04:51.537
into precisely tuned electrical impulses

00:04:51.537 --> 00:04:56.299
that distinguish claps, taps, 
sighs, and flies.
