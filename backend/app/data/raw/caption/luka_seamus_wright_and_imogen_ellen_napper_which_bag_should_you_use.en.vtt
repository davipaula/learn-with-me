00:00:07.548 --> 00:00:10.938
You’ve filled up your cart and made 
it to the front of the grocery line

00:00:10.938 --> 00:00:13.878
when you’re confronted 
with yet another choice:

00:00:13.878 --> 00:00:16.568
what kind of bag should you use?

00:00:16.568 --> 00:00:19.958
If you’ve seen the images of plastic bags
strewn across the ocean,

00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:23.348
it might seem obvious that plastic 
is bad for the environment.

00:00:23.348 --> 00:00:27.118
Surely a paper bag or a cotton tote
would be the better option.

00:00:27.118 --> 00:00:28.968
But is that really true?

00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:32.548
Each of these three materials 
has a unique environmental impact

00:00:32.548 --> 00:00:34.838
that’s determined by its carbon footprint,

00:00:34.838 --> 00:00:38.982
its potential to be reused and recycled,
and its degradability.

00:00:38.982 --> 00:00:41.754
So, to get the full story 
on these grocery bags

00:00:41.754 --> 00:00:43.684
we need to look at how they’re made,

00:00:43.684 --> 00:00:47.384
how they’re used, 
and where they ultimately go.

00:00:47.384 --> 00:00:49.554
Let’s start with plastic.

00:00:49.554 --> 00:00:54.401
The typical thin and flimsy plastic bag 
is made of high-density polyethylene,

00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:57.341
commonly known as HDPE.

00:00:57.341 --> 00:01:01.123
Producing this material requires
extracting petroleum from the ground

00:01:01.123 --> 00:01:03.393
and applying extreme heat.

00:01:03.393 --> 00:01:06.043
The resulting polymer resin 
is then transported

00:01:06.043 --> 00:01:10.153
alongside additional ingredients 
like titanium oxide and chalk

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:12.813
to a bag manufacturing plant.

00:01:12.813 --> 00:01:16.183
Here, coal powered machines 
melt the materials down

00:01:16.183 --> 00:01:18.403
and spin them into sheets of plastic,

00:01:18.403 --> 00:01:20.620
which are then folded into bags.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.250
By the time a bag reaches
its final destination,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.007
it’s contributed an estimated 1.6 kg
of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.

00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:31.707
That’s the same amount of carbon
a car produces,

00:01:31.707 --> 00:01:34.327
driving a little over 6 kilometers.

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:39.347
But the alternatives actually possess
a much larger carbon footprint.

00:01:39.347 --> 00:01:41.447
Paper is made from wood pulp,

00:01:41.447 --> 00:01:45.447
and when you account for the carbon cost
of removing trees from their ecosystems,

00:01:45.447 --> 00:01:51.230
a single paper bag can be responsible
for about 5.5 kg of carbon dioxide.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.302
Meanwhile, growing cotton is an extremely
energy and water intensive process.

00:01:56.302 --> 00:01:58.792
The production of a single cotton tote

00:01:58.792 --> 00:02:04.349
emits an estimated 272 kg
of carbon dioxide.

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:08.980
When we compare carbon footprints,
plastic bags are the clear winner.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:13.312
But environmental impact 
is also determined by how the bag is used.

00:02:13.312 --> 00:02:15.712
Reusing or recycling these bags

00:02:15.712 --> 00:02:18.302
significantly offsets 
their environmental toll

00:02:18.302 --> 00:02:21.102
by reducing demand for new production.

00:02:21.102 --> 00:02:25.022
To quantify that offset, we can divide
the bag’s carbon footprint

00:02:25.022 --> 00:02:27.632
by the number of times it’s reused.

00:02:27.632 --> 00:02:31.783
For example, if a typical paper bag 
is reused three times,

00:02:31.783 --> 00:02:35.783
it has a lower net impact 
than a single-use plastic bag.

00:02:35.783 --> 00:02:39.593
The carbon footprint of a cotton tote
can similarly be lowered,

00:02:39.593 --> 00:02:43.193
if it’s reused 131 times.

00:02:43.193 --> 00:02:47.873
Of these three options, durable cloth
totes are most likely to be reused.

00:02:47.873 --> 00:02:52.329
Evidence shows paper bags are quickly
discarded due to their tendency to tear.

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.455
This issue plagues HDPE
plastic bags as well.

00:02:55.455 --> 00:02:57.599
But even when they’re made 
to avoid tearing,

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.317
their widespread availability makes
it easy to treat them as single-use items.

00:03:02.317 --> 00:03:06.784
Fortunately, researchers estimate
that 40% of HDPE bags

00:03:06.784 --> 00:03:10.534
are reused at least once
for throwing out waste.

00:03:10.534 --> 00:03:14.044
Recycling these bags also offsets 
their carbon footprint,

00:03:14.044 --> 00:03:17.264
but it’s not universally possible 
for each material.

00:03:17.264 --> 00:03:21.683
Many countries lack the infrastructure
to efficiently recycle plastic bags.

00:03:21.683 --> 00:03:25.293
Cotton totes are perhaps even more
difficult to breakdown and process,

00:03:25.293 --> 00:03:27.813
but since they’re often reused 
for long periods,

00:03:27.813 --> 00:03:31.193
they’re still least likely 
to end up in landfills.

00:03:31.193 --> 00:03:33.463
Whenever these bags aren’t recycled,

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:37.293
the third factor in calculating
environmental impact comes into play:

00:03:37.293 --> 00:03:38.753
degradability.

00:03:38.753 --> 00:03:42.753
Since HDPE bags are heat-resistant
and insoluble,

00:03:42.753 --> 00:03:45.363
they stick around long after we’re done
with them.

00:03:45.363 --> 00:03:49.789
Partially broken down plastic 
can circulate in ecosystems for centuries.

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:53.689
Cotton on the other hand degrades
substantially in a matter of months,

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:58.328
and paper bags break down 
completely in just 90 days.

00:03:58.328 --> 00:04:00.878
So, which bag should you use?

00:04:00.878 --> 00:04:03.428
It turns out the most 
environmentally friendly bags

00:04:03.428 --> 00:04:06.718
have features of several materials
we've discussed.

00:04:06.718 --> 00:04:10.995
They’re durable and reusable, like cotton,
but made of plastic,

00:04:10.995 --> 00:04:14.875
which has a lower carbon footprint
than cotton or paper.

00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:20.447
These sturdy shopping bags consist of
polyester, vinyl and other tough plastics,

00:04:20.447 --> 00:04:22.787
and are already used worldwide.

00:04:22.787 --> 00:04:26.037
Most importantly, 
they should last a lifetime—

00:04:26.037 --> 00:04:30.127
making them the best option 
for the planet, and your groceries.
