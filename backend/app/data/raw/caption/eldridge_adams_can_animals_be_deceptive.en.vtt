00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:10.921
A male firefly glows above a field 
on a summer’s night,

00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:13.951
emitting a series of enticing flashes.

00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:17.511
He hopes a nearby female will respond
with her own lightshow

00:00:17.511 --> 00:00:18.741
and mate with him.

00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:20.401
Sadly for this male,

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:23.501
it won’t turn out quite the way he plans.

00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:28.071
A female from a different species 
mimics his pulsing patterns:

00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:31.091
by tricking the male with 
her promise of partnership,

00:00:31.091 --> 00:00:32.601
she lures him in–

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:35.061
and turns him into an easy meal.

00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:37.281
He’s been deceived.

00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:42.286
Behavioral biologists have identified 
three defining hallmarks of deception

00:00:42.286 --> 00:00:44.506
by non-human animals:

00:00:44.506 --> 00:00:46.576
it must mislead the receiver,

00:00:46.576 --> 00:00:48.546
the deceiver must benefit,

00:00:48.546 --> 00:00:51.286
and it can’t simply be an accident.

00:00:51.286 --> 00:00:55.810
In this case we know that the predatory 
firefly’s signal isn’t an accident

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.990
because she flexibly 
adjusts her flash pattern

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.080
to match males of different species.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.650
Based on this definition,

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.240
where is animal deception seen in nature?

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.490
Camouflage is a good starting point–

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.360
and one of the most familiar examples 
of animal trickery.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.060
The leaf-tailed gecko and the 
octopus fool viewers

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.430
by blending into the surfaces 
on which they rest.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.615
Other animals use mimicry 
to protect themselves.

00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:28.375
Harmless scarlet kingsnakes have evolved 
red, yellow, and black patterns

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:31.945
resembling those of the venomous 
eastern coral snake

00:01:31.945 --> 00:01:36.475
to benefit from the protective warnings 
these markings convey.

00:01:36.475 --> 00:01:38.483
Even some plants use mimicry:

00:01:38.483 --> 00:01:44.353
there are orchids that look and smell like
female wasps to attract hapless males,

00:01:44.353 --> 00:01:47.233
who end up pollinating the plant.

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:50.723
Some of these animals benefit 
by having fixed characteristics

00:01:50.723 --> 00:01:54.163
that are evolutionary suited 
to their environments.

00:01:54.163 --> 00:01:55.473
But in other cases,

00:01:55.473 --> 00:01:59.553
the deceiver seems to anticipate 
the reactions of other animals

00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:02.443
and to adjust its behavior accordingly.

00:02:02.443 --> 00:02:03.543
Sensing a threat,

00:02:03.543 --> 00:02:08.103
the octopus will rapidly change its colors
to match its surroundings.

00:02:08.103 --> 00:02:11.812
Dwarf chameleons color-match their 
environments more closely

00:02:11.812 --> 00:02:14.952
when they see a bird predator 
rather than a snake–

00:02:14.952 --> 00:02:18.392
birds, after all, 
have better color vision.

00:02:18.392 --> 00:02:21.392
One of the more fascinating 
examples of animal deception

00:02:21.392 --> 00:02:24.212
comes from the fork-tailed drongo.

00:02:24.212 --> 00:02:28.062
This bird sits atop tall trees 
in the Kalahari Desert,

00:02:28.062 --> 00:02:32.612
surveying the landscape for predators 
and calling when it senses a threat.

00:02:32.612 --> 00:02:37.622
That sends meerkats, pied babblers, 
and others dashing for cover.

00:02:37.622 --> 00:02:40.432
But the drongo will also sound 
a false alarm

00:02:40.432 --> 00:02:43.452
when those other species 
have captured prey.

00:02:43.452 --> 00:02:45.932
As the meerkats and babblers flee,

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:49.612
the drongo swoops down 
to steal their catches.

00:02:49.612 --> 00:02:52.022
This tactic works about half the time–

00:02:52.022 --> 00:02:55.602
and it provides drongos 
with much of their food.

00:02:55.602 --> 00:02:56.962
There are fewer solid cases

00:02:56.962 --> 00:03:01.056
of animals using signals to trick members 
of their own species,

00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:02.896
but that happens too.

00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:04.945
Consider the mantis shrimp.

00:03:04.945 --> 00:03:06.347
Like other crustaceans,

00:03:06.347 --> 00:03:08.107
it molts as it grows,

00:03:08.107 --> 00:03:11.547
which leaves its soft body 
vulnerable to attack.

00:03:11.547 --> 00:03:15.447
But it’s still driven to protect 
its home against rivals.

00:03:15.447 --> 00:03:18.627
So it has become a masterful bluffer.

00:03:18.627 --> 00:03:20.207
Despite being fragile,

00:03:20.207 --> 00:03:24.997
a newly molted shrimp is actually 
more likely to threaten intruders,

00:03:24.997 --> 00:03:30.508
spreading the large limbs it usually uses 
to strike or stab its opponents.

00:03:30.508 --> 00:03:31.721
And that works –

00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:36.461
bluffers are more likely to keep 
their homes than non-bluffers.

00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:37.976
In its softened condition,

00:03:37.976 --> 00:03:40.496
a mantis shrimp couldn’t 
withstand a fight–

00:03:40.496 --> 00:03:42.336
which is why we can be confident

00:03:42.336 --> 00:03:44.506
that its behavior is a bluff.

00:03:44.506 --> 00:03:48.472
Biologists have even noticed 
that its bluffs are tactical:

00:03:48.472 --> 00:03:53.502
newly molted mantis shrimp are more likely
to bluff against smaller rivals,

00:03:53.502 --> 00:03:57.032
who are especially likely 
to be driven away.

00:03:57.032 --> 00:04:00.302
It would seem that instead of just 
threatening reflexively,

00:04:00.302 --> 00:04:05.192
the mantis shrimp is swiftly gauging the 
situation and predicting others’ behavior,

00:04:05.192 --> 00:04:07.272
to get the best result.

00:04:07.282 --> 00:04:09.372
So we know that animals can deceive,

00:04:09.372 --> 00:04:11.372
but do they do so with intent?

00:04:11.372 --> 00:04:12.982
That’s a difficult question,

00:04:12.982 --> 00:04:16.332
and many scientists think 
we'll never be able to answer it.

00:04:16.332 --> 00:04:19.112
We can't observe animals’ 
internal thoughts.

00:04:19.112 --> 00:04:24.042
But we don’t need to know what an animal 
is thinking in order to detect deception.

00:04:24.042 --> 00:04:26.472
By watching behavior and its outcomes,

00:04:25.885 --> 00:04:30.645
we learn that animals manipulate 
predators, prey, and rivals,

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:32.765
and that their capacity for deception

00:04:32.765 --> 00:04:35.815
can be surprisingly complex.
