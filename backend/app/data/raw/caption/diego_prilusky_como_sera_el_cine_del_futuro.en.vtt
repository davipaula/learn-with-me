00:00:12.131 --> 00:00:15.822
The art of movies has existed
for more than 100 years.

00:00:17.052 --> 00:00:20.558
And the way we make movies
hasn't changed much

00:00:20.558 --> 00:00:22.417
from a dimensional perspective.

00:00:23.087 --> 00:00:26.542
Placing a camera and press the rec button,
this has not changed at all.

00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:32.018
Cinema is still a frontal experience,

00:00:32.018 --> 00:00:34.197
and it's still perceived as such.

00:00:34.827 --> 00:00:38.473
The experience of watching movies
is the same since their creation.

00:00:39.143 --> 00:00:43.710
You stand in front of a screen
and look at the image displayed.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.685
In fact, there's nothing wrong with that.

00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:50.471
I love going to the movies, 
watching movies on TV;

00:00:50.471 --> 00:00:54.691
the experience of watching
stories in motion

00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:57.591
can be so powerful
to even move us emotionally.

00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:02.296
The question we ponder on
is how stories in motion

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:05.457
can go beyond the flat screen.

00:01:06.487 --> 00:01:11.585
If we look at the media of the future 
there is an opportunity to create content

00:01:11.585 --> 00:01:13.795
that adapts to new platforms.

00:01:15.815 --> 00:01:18.342
When we shoot a film,

00:01:18.342 --> 00:01:23.745
we traditionally imagine 
a scene inside a frame,

00:01:23.745 --> 00:01:28.608
creating depth with foreground,
middleground and background,

00:01:28.608 --> 00:01:30.062
as the camera moves.

00:01:31.492 --> 00:01:35.610
Obviously, with new devices

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.516
like virtual reality 
or augmented reality goggles

00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:45.671
or new smart platforms
that allow us to navigate in 3D,

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:50.348
there is an opportunity to create
much more immersive content.

00:01:51.868 --> 00:01:56.572
In a way that we could move inside it

00:01:56.572 --> 00:02:00.754
and try to live the experience
from a new perspective.

00:02:01.574 --> 00:02:07.980
I'm not talking about video games
or computer-created characters,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.111
even if they look super realistic.

00:02:10.471 --> 00:02:12.776
I'm talking about real actors.

00:02:12.776 --> 00:02:16.163
Flesh-and-blood performance. 
Artistic performance.

00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:21.938
To do such a thing
we would have to start redefining

00:02:21.938 --> 00:02:25.878
or thinking about new technologies
and methodologies

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:28.736
to enable these new experiences.

00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:37.009
We already know about 360-degree filming,

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:38.677
putting a camera in the center

00:02:38.677 --> 00:02:43.363
that allows us to create
a 360-degree immersive image.

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:47.342
This already takes us
one step further in an interaction.

00:02:47.672 --> 00:02:51.401
But it's still a frontal experience.

00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:59.080
To start investigating
how we could get into the scene

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.012
we would have to capture the light
from all angles,

00:03:02.012 --> 00:03:06.071
putting cameras and sensors
to capture all the light

00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:07.569
from all perspectives.

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:15.227
These solutions allow us to recreate
the subject in three dimensions.

00:03:16.137 --> 00:03:20.155
It would be like a 3D photograph.

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:27.445
This allows us to not just record
the image on one single plane

00:03:27.445 --> 00:03:29.586
but capture it as a volume.

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:32.827
This is what we call volumetric video.

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:37.063
It is the process of capturing light
and storing it inside a voxel.

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:41.136
But what is a voxel?

00:03:41.946 --> 00:03:45.681
A voxel is like a pixel 
in three dimensions.

00:03:46.221 --> 00:03:50.789
Instead of being a flat square 
with light information,

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:55.045
it's like a cube in space,
with position X, Y and Z,

00:03:55.045 --> 00:03:58.294
saving all the light information
from all perspectives.

00:03:58.474 --> 00:04:02.920
This methodology allows us
to generate a volume of light

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.290
visible from all sides.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.726
And with this, we can start thinking

00:04:08.726 --> 00:04:11.653
and opening up the opportunities 
for new content.

00:04:13.243 --> 00:04:16.366
Obviously, to capture and create film

00:04:16.366 --> 00:04:21.363
and scenes and stories 
with this kind of solution

00:04:21.363 --> 00:04:24.180
we would have to create a space

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.143
large enough to accommodate 
entire scenes and montages,

00:04:29.143 --> 00:04:33.530
and powerful enough to install 
hundreds of cameras

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.361
and process that huge amount
of information.

00:04:37.911 --> 00:04:41.878
It sounds like a crazy idea,
but it's exactly what we did.

00:04:42.678 --> 00:04:46.683
For the last three years
we've been building

00:04:46.683 --> 00:04:48.423
the studio of the future.

00:04:49.373 --> 00:04:52.181
We installed hundreds of cameras.

00:04:52.881 --> 00:04:57.320
And we built a gigantic dome

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.910
that allows us to create
exactly what we wanted.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.882
We called it Intel Studios.

00:05:04.442 --> 00:05:07.378
It is the world's largest
volumetric camera,

00:05:07.378 --> 00:05:12.183
created to develop, research, and define

00:05:12.183 --> 00:05:15.017
new methodologies 
for interactive content.

00:05:16.227 --> 00:05:19.184
But what does interactive content mean?

00:05:19.184 --> 00:05:22.042
What does it mean to get into the scene?

00:05:22.932 --> 00:05:27.189
To test these new hypotheses and ideas

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:30.860
we decided, for the first time 
we used the studio,

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.439
to choose a classic scene.

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:36.012
We picked a scene from the Far West.

00:05:37.947 --> 00:05:46.407
We brought scenarios, filled the studio
with dirt, actors, four horses,

00:05:46.407 --> 00:05:49.705
to recreate an entire scene

00:05:49.705 --> 00:05:52.430
but this time captured from all angles.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:06:00.917
The actors, to work on these 
new media, faced a challenge.

00:06:01.707 --> 00:06:07.619
They had to act flawlessly 
to be seen from all angles.

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:11.774
There is no longer a frontal position 
that you just refer to.

00:06:12.524 --> 00:06:15.181
But now we have to think
of all perspectives.

00:06:15.791 --> 00:06:17.351
Very similar to theater.

00:06:19.411 --> 00:06:23.221
Let's see now what came out
with the first result.

00:06:25.031 --> 00:06:29.908
What you see here opened our eyes
to the opportunities we can have

00:06:29.908 --> 00:06:31.725
with these new technologies and media.

00:06:32.645 --> 00:06:35.831
The result was a complete full scan
of the entire scene.

00:06:36.511 --> 00:06:41.991
And it allowed us to move inside
in a free way that we couldn't before.

00:06:43.601 --> 00:06:46.511
With this new solution we can see

00:06:46.511 --> 00:06:49.037
not only the image or light 
emitted on a screen

00:06:49.037 --> 00:06:53.842
but also get into that light
and navigate inside its volume,

00:06:53.842 --> 00:06:55.892
perceiving it from new angles.

00:06:57.812 --> 00:07:04.154
Now let's look at one of the shots 
we rendered using this technology.

00:07:05.184 --> 00:07:08.774
What you will see is done entirely 
with a virtual camera

00:07:08.774 --> 00:07:10.294
that moves in space.

00:07:11.374 --> 00:07:12.749
(Volumetric video)

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:37.972
(End of volumetric video)

00:07:38.936 --> 00:07:40.364
(Applause)

00:07:40.364 --> 00:07:41.641
Thank you.

00:07:48.811 --> 00:07:53.544
As you can see, with this solution
we manage to have total control

00:07:53.544 --> 00:07:56.112
of space and movement,

00:07:56.112 --> 00:08:01.006
allowing new angles and freedom 
for content creation.

00:08:01.616 --> 00:08:04.831
But what else can we do 
with this freedom?

00:08:05.501 --> 00:08:09.502
Can we put a virtual camera 
in the eyes of the actors,

00:08:09.502 --> 00:08:10.963
from their points of view?

00:08:11.213 --> 00:08:15.027
What if instead of the actor 
we chose the horse?

00:08:15.537 --> 00:08:17.373
Let's look at the same scene --

00:08:17.373 --> 00:08:19.634
there wasn't a new take --

00:08:19.634 --> 00:08:21.860
but this time, from the horse.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:23.849
(Volumetric video)

00:08:34.029 --> 00:08:35.332
(End of volumetric video)

00:08:35.572 --> 00:08:38.905
(Applause)

00:08:40.255 --> 00:08:44.881
No horse was harmed and no camera
was placed on his head.

00:08:44.881 --> 00:08:50.347
Actually, this frees up the possibilities 
of navigating within the scene.

00:08:51.247 --> 00:08:56.407
This is perfect for filmmakers
or content creators

00:08:56.407 --> 00:09:00.035
as it gives them the tools 
to create these new visualizations.

00:09:00.375 --> 00:09:02.385
But what about the audience?

00:09:02.385 --> 00:09:05.727
We can look into how the audience
can get immersed.

00:09:06.777 --> 00:09:09.705
That's why we partnered up
with Paramount Pictures.

00:09:10.055 --> 00:09:13.244
We researched how the experience

00:09:13.244 --> 00:09:17.074
and interactions within stories in motion
would be like

00:09:17.074 --> 00:09:18.680
in some Hollywood movies.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.401
Together with director Randal Kleiser

00:09:23.401 --> 00:09:28.402
we got together and recreated
the 1978 film Grease.

00:09:29.112 --> 00:09:33.519
Bringing 20 dancers to the stage,

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:36.810
we recreated the song 
"You're the One That I Want"

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.985
in a brand new take.

00:09:40.945 --> 00:09:45.381
What you see here really allowed 
the directors and us

00:09:45.381 --> 00:09:49.104
to break down the barriers of 2D thinking.

00:09:49.674 --> 00:09:53.236
And start thinking in a whole new way

00:09:53.236 --> 00:09:54.935
and let new tools come up

00:09:54.935 --> 00:09:57.511
for content and for creating new stories.

00:09:58.081 --> 00:10:01.883
But why see it in a flat way?

00:10:02.443 --> 00:10:05.442
Let's invite them to the stage.

00:10:08.682 --> 00:10:12.783
Not really, we'll bring them 
in augmented reality.

00:10:13.413 --> 00:10:20.077
I'm going to use this tablet, 
I'm mapping the scenario,

00:10:20.077 --> 00:10:22.275
recording the information in 3D.

00:10:30.525 --> 00:10:33.650
(Applause)

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.958
Let's see what they say.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.367
(AR video)

00:10:51.385 --> 00:10:55.342
(Clapping)

00:11:12.562 --> 00:11:13.497
(End of AR video)

00:11:13.497 --> 00:11:17.657
(Applause)

00:11:26.877 --> 00:11:29.509
Thanks to the augmented dancers.

00:11:31.089 --> 00:11:33.325
As you can see,

00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:38.312
the content can be experienced
as a traditional movie

00:11:38.312 --> 00:11:40.372
or as an immersive experience.

00:11:40.702 --> 00:11:43.534
It all depends on how and what
we're seeing it with.

00:11:44.674 --> 00:11:49.674
We're not trying to change
the traditional ways of creating content,

00:11:49.674 --> 00:11:51.177
but to enhance them.

00:11:52.647 --> 00:11:56.602
We are at a unique moment
in the history of cinema,

00:11:56.602 --> 00:12:00.683
opening up and understanding new ways
to create immersive content.

00:12:01.983 --> 00:12:04.020
The journey has just begun.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.343
I invite you all to join us.

00:12:08.043 --> 00:12:08.912
Thank you.

00:12:08.912 --> 00:12:11.415
(Applause)
