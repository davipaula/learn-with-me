00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.934
Now, I know it might be easy to think

00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:17.851
that microbes are bad,

00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:20.268
especially for infants,

00:00:20.292 --> 00:00:23.125
but research has in fact
proven the opposite.

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:27.393
And the truth might be
a little bit more complex,

00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:30.542
but it's actually way more interesting.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.851
It seems that we need microbes

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:36.000
to be programmed for good health,

00:00:37.083 --> 00:00:38.809
but not just any microbes,

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:41.226
we need the right combination.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.934
We succeed best
with the little microbial bodies

00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:47.708
we have adapted to coexist with
during evolution.

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:50.518
And I guess it won't surprise you

00:00:50.542 --> 00:00:55.226
to learn that we start acquiring
that right combination right at birth.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.458
Well, at least some of us do.

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:01.684
Babies born by C-section
and babies born vaginally

00:01:01.708 --> 00:01:02.976
aren't the same

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.143
when it comes to microbial start to life,

00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:10.559
and after birth there are
countless different early life events

00:01:10.583 --> 00:01:11.893
and circumstances

00:01:11.917 --> 00:01:16.059
that further modulate the way
the gut microbiota is developing,

00:01:16.083 --> 00:01:21.184
such as the medications that might be
prescribed for the infant or the mother,

00:01:21.208 --> 00:01:24.351
number of pets and siblings in the family,

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:26.184
as well as level of hygiene at home,

00:01:26.208 --> 00:01:28.184
and, in this case, it's actually better

00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:31.083
if it's not that perfectly
clean all the time.

00:01:32.542 --> 00:01:35.809
And also nutrition,
both mothers and infants.

00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:40.768
All of these events
and circumstances play a huge role

00:01:40.792 --> 00:01:43.268
in the gut microbial development

00:01:43.292 --> 00:01:47.833
and that has a huge impact
on the lifelong health of that baby.

00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:52.684
And I'm not talking about
small health implications here.

00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:55.143
I'm talking about the big stuff.

00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:58.226
Microbes we acquire or do not acquire

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.268
affect our likelihood of developing
diseases like obesity, diabetes

00:02:03.292 --> 00:02:04.833
and even some cancers.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.101
Since many of these
early life events I just listed

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:11.476
are such that we cannot affect them,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.934
they are inevitable,

00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:16.268
for example C-sections
have been invented to save lives,

00:02:16.292 --> 00:02:18.351
and they do that daily,

00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:22.143
and most medications
are prescribed for a valid reason,

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:25.018
especially for infants, and so on.

00:02:25.042 --> 00:02:28.143
That is why we have to learn

00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:30.684
how to protect the health of these babies

00:02:30.708 --> 00:02:34.143
after the occurrence
of such early life events

00:02:34.167 --> 00:02:37.042
that might disrupt their gut
microbiota development.

00:02:38.542 --> 00:02:39.893
I work as a researcher

00:02:39.917 --> 00:02:43.268
and as a technical lead
of an infant health platform,

00:02:43.292 --> 00:02:47.518
and the question I'm trying
to find a solution to every day at work,

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:51.309
and the same question
I'm aiming to answer in this talk,

00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:53.809
is how can we make sure

00:02:53.833 --> 00:02:57.101
that all babies get the same shot
at lifelong health,

00:02:57.125 --> 00:03:02.208
no matter how they're born
or what early life events they encounter.

00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:05.333
Seems like a noble cause, right?

00:03:06.125 --> 00:03:07.393
Great.

00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:09.101
So let's figure this out.

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:14.500
To begin, remember how I said that we need
the right combination of microbes?

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:18.434
Well, to get that combination right,

00:03:18.458 --> 00:03:21.934
we need to receive those microbes
that inhabit our bodies

00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:23.583
in a certain order.

00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:28.351
You can think of it
like a colonization march.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:33.101
The very early microbes
that inhabit our bodies first

00:03:33.125 --> 00:03:36.684
change the environment in the infant's gut

00:03:36.708 --> 00:03:40.768
so that the next microbes
are able to move in,

00:03:40.792 --> 00:03:42.684
kind of like the first invaders

00:03:42.708 --> 00:03:45.059
come in first and set up
the infrastructure

00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:47.208
for the other settlers to build upon.

00:03:48.292 --> 00:03:51.059
Now, if babies are born via C-section,

00:03:51.083 --> 00:03:55.101
that early phase of colonization
is greatly altered,

00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:59.851
because instead of vaginal,
fecal and skin bacteria of the mother,

00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:03.809
mainly only skin bacteria
enter the infant gut.

00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:08.726
And that sets that colonization march
to a totally different tone,

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.601
and simply because that's different
to what we've adapted to during evolution,

00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:20.226
that might cause some health disadvantages
for C-section-born babies later on.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.184
We can take weight development
as an example here.

00:04:23.208 --> 00:04:26.143
It has been already shown
in several studies

00:04:26.167 --> 00:04:28.309
that gut microbiota composition

00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:30.184
is associated to weight

00:04:30.208 --> 00:04:32.518
as well as the likelihood
of developing diseases

00:04:32.542 --> 00:04:36.226
like diabetes or cardiovascular diseases.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.684
But now there are some indications

00:04:38.708 --> 00:04:41.226
that you could already at infancy

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.726
see from a fecal sample of a baby

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.768
some microbes missing
from those individuals

00:04:46.792 --> 00:04:50.250
who will later on develop
to be obese or overweight.

00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:55.101
It has also been shown
that those same microbes

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:58.351
might be missing from babies
who are born by C-section

00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:02.768
or who are predisposed to heavy loads
of antibiotics in early life.

00:05:02.792 --> 00:05:04.434
And to kind of close this loop,

00:05:04.458 --> 00:05:06.809
it has also been shown in some research

00:05:06.833 --> 00:05:08.934
that babies born by C-section

00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:13.018
or are prescribed with many,
many antibiotics early in life

00:05:13.042 --> 00:05:17.143
are more likely to be obese
or overweight, even by 50 percent,

00:05:17.167 --> 00:05:18.417
which is a lot.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.768
Now, I know you might
be thinking at this point

00:05:21.792 --> 00:05:26.268
that, oh no, I just had a C-section
or I was born via C-section

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:28.792
or my child had the antibiotics.

00:05:29.917 --> 00:05:32.851
But I want you to not worry.

00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:35.809
If these microbes are missing

00:05:35.833 --> 00:05:38.143
or are lost for any reason,

00:05:38.167 --> 00:05:41.309
they can be acquired later,

00:05:41.333 --> 00:05:43.792
but the baby just needs
a little help with that.

00:05:44.708 --> 00:05:49.500
One thing that has already for some time
been known to help is breastfeeding.

00:05:50.417 --> 00:05:52.476
Breast milk is kind of miraculous:

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.601
in addition to containing
nutrients for the baby,

00:05:55.625 --> 00:06:00.417
it seems to contain food
for the good microbes as well.

00:06:01.792 --> 00:06:04.643
That's great for a breastfed baby,

00:06:04.667 --> 00:06:08.684
but we all know that all babies
are not breastfed.

00:06:08.708 --> 00:06:13.934
So what could we do to ensure that also
those babies who are not breastfed

00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:16.393
could restore their microbiota development

00:06:16.417 --> 00:06:20.143
after encountering
those disruptive early life events

00:06:20.167 --> 00:06:23.893
that might disrupt
their gut microbiota development?

00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:28.667
And now we get to the actual
solution part of this talk.

00:06:29.375 --> 00:06:33.601
The research in this field
has been taking giant steps lately.

00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:37.684
First, it was understood
that if there are some microbes missing,

00:06:37.708 --> 00:06:39.976
they can be ingested.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.059
We call the good microbes,
when they are ingested, probiotics,

00:06:44.083 --> 00:06:45.643
and probiotics have been tested

00:06:45.667 --> 00:06:48.434
in several clinical trials
during the years,

00:06:48.458 --> 00:06:50.726
also in infants, with great effects,

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.875
such as reducing their risk
of eczema later in life.

00:06:55.458 --> 00:06:57.976
Now, a second revolution was realized

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.101
when the eyes of researchers
were turned to breast milk.

00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:03.434
That was logical, as, like I mentioned,

00:07:03.458 --> 00:07:08.309
it was already known that breastfeeding
is able to support the healthy development

00:07:08.333 --> 00:07:10.000
of gut microbiota.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.476
There were these particles in breast milk

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.059
that were found already in the 1930s

00:07:19.083 --> 00:07:21.601
called human milk oligosaccharides,

00:07:21.625 --> 00:07:24.559
but their function remained a mystery

00:07:24.583 --> 00:07:29.000
for decades and decades
after their initial discovery.

00:07:29.833 --> 00:07:32.476
They were really puzzling for researchers,

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.226
as they are really abundant in human milk.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.851
They are actually
the third-largest group of solids,

00:07:39.875 --> 00:07:43.643
but they are not digestible
by humans, not even infants.

00:07:43.667 --> 00:07:47.351
So why would mothers synthesize
something to breast milk,

00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:50.143
use their resources to put something there

00:07:50.167 --> 00:07:53.184
that is not utilizable by the infant?

00:07:53.208 --> 00:07:55.643
Usually nature does not work that way.

00:07:55.667 --> 00:07:56.934
Right?

00:07:56.958 --> 00:08:00.726
So it was quite a revelation
when it was finally understood

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.934
what's the role of these particles,

00:08:02.958 --> 00:08:08.351
and that it is to selectively feed
the microbes that are best for infants,

00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:11.768
and that way to affect the infant health.

00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:15.893
There are over a hundred
of different HMO structures,

00:08:15.917 --> 00:08:20.708
and nowadays we are able to synthesize
some of them also in the lab,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.393
and that enables us to package them up

00:08:24.417 --> 00:08:27.643
with probiotics for children and infants

00:08:27.667 --> 00:08:30.393
who are not able to receive them
from breast milk

00:08:30.417 --> 00:08:32.559
to restore their microbiota

00:08:32.583 --> 00:08:36.375
after encountering
disruptive early life events.

00:08:37.417 --> 00:08:39.684
And that is the solution.

00:08:39.708 --> 00:08:42.893
As a researcher, I must say at this point

00:08:42.917 --> 00:08:45.851
that research in this field
is still ongoing

00:08:45.875 --> 00:08:48.809
and a lot of work remains to be done.

00:08:48.833 --> 00:08:52.226
That's a favorite sentence
of us scientists.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:57.268
But we are taking steps
towards understanding better and better

00:08:57.292 --> 00:09:01.018
which are the key missing microbes
in various situations

00:09:01.042 --> 00:09:05.601
and what HMOs we should package
with which probiotics

00:09:05.625 --> 00:09:11.583
to help restore the microbiota of that
particular baby in that particular case.

00:09:13.458 --> 00:09:16.059
What I wish you to remember from this talk

00:09:16.083 --> 00:09:20.809
is that, yes, vaginally born
breastfed baby has the microbiota

00:09:20.833 --> 00:09:22.809
we have evolved to adapt to,

00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:26.268
but in cases where that is not possible,

00:09:26.292 --> 00:09:30.625
there are means to reduce
the negative health consequences.

00:09:33.083 --> 00:09:37.893
Lastly, I wish you to imagine
a world for a while,

00:09:37.917 --> 00:09:40.684
a world where there would be
such a health care system

00:09:40.708 --> 00:09:43.476
that when you take your baby
to a health care check,

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.809
they would routinely monitor the gut
microbiota development of that baby,

00:09:47.833 --> 00:09:50.476
and if any disruptions would be noted,

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.184
a tailor-made product
to restore the microbiota

00:09:54.208 --> 00:09:55.500
would be prescribed.

00:09:56.583 --> 00:09:59.518
I mean, how wonderful would that be,

00:09:59.542 --> 00:10:04.101
if the onset of any chronic diseases
would be extremely rare

00:10:04.125 --> 00:10:07.042
because of this preemptive
health care system?

00:10:08.458 --> 00:10:10.167
Can you imagine such a world?

00:10:11.458 --> 00:10:15.000
Do you believe that that kind
of future would be possible?

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:19.059
I do.

00:10:19.083 --> 00:10:21.809
I believe in that future
and I want to contribute

00:10:21.833 --> 00:10:23.750
in the unfolding of that future,

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:30.101
a future in which each baby
has an equal starting point for life

00:10:30.125 --> 00:10:32.250
to be programmed for lifelong health.

00:10:33.208 --> 00:10:34.476
Thank you.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.125
(Applause)
