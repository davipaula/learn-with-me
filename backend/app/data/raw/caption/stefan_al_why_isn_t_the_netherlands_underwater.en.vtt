00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:13.561
In January of 1953, a tidal surge 
shook the North Sea.

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.602
The titanic waves flooded 
the Dutch coastline,

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:19.425
killing almost 2,000 people.

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:23.491
54 years later, a similar storm 
threatened the region.

00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:26.451
But this time, the Netherlands 
were ready.

00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:27.801
As the water swelled,

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:32.469
state-of-the-art computer sensors 
activated emergency protocols.

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.099
Over the next 30 minutes,

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:38.952
a pair of 240-meter steel arms 
swung shut,

00:00:38.952 --> 00:00:40.832
protecting the channel ahead.

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:43.692
Using 680-tonne ball joints,

00:00:43.692 --> 00:00:47.886
the barrier moved in rhythm 
with the shifting wind and waves.

00:00:47.886 --> 00:00:51.527
By morning, the storm had passed 
with minimal flooding.

00:00:51.527 --> 00:00:54.997
The first field activation 
of the Maeslantkering

00:00:54.997 --> 00:00:57.197
had been a resounding success.

00:00:57.197 --> 00:01:00.111
As one of the planet’s largest mobile 
structures,

00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:04.111
this storm surge barrier 
is a marvel of human engineering.

00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:07.382
But the Maeslantkering is just one part
of a massive,

00:01:07.382 --> 00:01:12.478
interlocking system of water controls 
known as the Delta Works—

00:01:12.478 --> 00:01:17.281
the most sophisticated flood prevention 
project in the world.

00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:20.411
The Netherlands has a long history 
with water management.

00:01:20.411 --> 00:01:24.598
The country lies along the delta 
of three major European rivers,

00:01:24.598 --> 00:01:28.656
and nearly a quarter of its territory 
is below sea level.

00:01:28.656 --> 00:01:32.728
This geography makes the region 
extremely prone to flooding.

00:01:32.728 --> 00:01:36.498
So much so, that some of the earliest 
Dutch governing bodies

00:01:36.498 --> 00:01:41.599
were informal “water boards” that 
coordinated flood protection projects.

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:47.010
But after the storms of 1953, the Dutch
government took more official measures.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.560
They established the Delta Commission,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.039
and tasked them with protecting 
the entire southwestern region.

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.349
Focusing on densely populated cities,

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:01.973
their aim was to reduce the annual odds 
of flooding below 1 in 10,000—

00:02:01.973 --> 00:02:06.303
about 100 times as safe
as the average coastal city.

00:02:06.303 --> 00:02:10.742
Accomplishing this lofty goal required
various infrastructure projects

00:02:10.742 --> 00:02:12.612
along the southwestern coast.

00:02:12.612 --> 00:02:17.564
The first line of defense was to dam 
the region’s flood-prone estuaries.

00:02:17.564 --> 00:02:22.300
These large inlets fed many of 
the country’s rivers into the North Sea,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.606
and during storms they allowed 
flood water to surge inland.

00:02:26.606 --> 00:02:31.093
Using a series of dams, the Delta 
Commission transformed these estuaries

00:02:31.093 --> 00:02:35.909
into expansive lakes that serve 
as nature preserves and community parks.

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.054
However, this solution wouldn’t work 
for the Nieuwe Waterweg.

00:02:40.054 --> 00:02:43.004
As the lifeblood of the local shipping 
industry,

00:02:43.004 --> 00:02:46.764
this passage had to be kept open 
in safe conditions,

00:02:46.764 --> 00:02:49.554
and barricaded during storm surges.

00:02:49.554 --> 00:02:52.714
In 1998, the completed Maeslantkering

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:56.053
provided the flexible 
protection necessary.

00:02:56.053 --> 00:03:00.986
Alongside additional barriers, 
like grassy dikes and concrete seawalls,

00:03:00.986 --> 00:03:05.158
these fortifications made up the bulk 
of the Delta Works project,

00:03:05.158 --> 00:03:09.158
which was primarily focused on 
holding back ocean storms.

00:03:09.158 --> 00:03:12.748
But in the following decades, 
the Dutch pursued additional plans

00:03:12.748 --> 00:03:17.310
to complement the Delta Works 
and protect against floods further inland.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.570
Under the "Room for the River" plan,

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.570
farms and dikes were relocated 
away from the shore.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.666
This left more space for water 
to collect in low-lying floodplains,

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:31.784
creating reservoirs and habitats 
for local wildlife.

00:03:31.784 --> 00:03:35.854
This strategic retreat not only 
decreased flood risk,

00:03:35.854 --> 00:03:38.038
but allowed for the redeveloped 
settlements

00:03:38.038 --> 00:03:40.938
to be built more densely and sustainably.

00:03:40.938 --> 00:03:46.252
Perhaps no city embodies the Netherlands' 
multi-pronged approach to water management

00:03:46.252 --> 00:03:51.679
as much as Rotterdam, a thriving city 
almost entirely below sea level.

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:53.229
When a storm threatens,

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:58.146
densely populated older districts 
are protected by traditional dikes.

00:03:58.146 --> 00:04:02.278
Meanwhile, newer districts 
have been artificially elevated,

00:04:02.278 --> 00:04:05.808
often sporting green roofs 
that store rainwater.

00:04:05.808 --> 00:04:10.227
Numerous structures around the city 
transform into water storage facilities,

00:04:10.227 --> 00:04:13.077
including parking garages and plazas

00:04:13.077 --> 00:04:16.757
which normally serve as theaters 
and sports arenas.

00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:21.407
Meanwhile in the harbor, floating 
pavilions rise with the water level.

00:04:21.407 --> 00:04:25.007
These are the first of several planned 
amphibious structures,

00:04:25.007 --> 00:04:30.026
some of which house water purification
systems and solar collectors.

00:04:30.026 --> 00:04:33.526
These strategies are just some 
of the technologies and policies

00:04:33.526 --> 00:04:37.526
that have put the Netherlands 
at the cutting edge of water management.

00:04:37.526 --> 00:04:41.446
The country continues to find new ways 
to make cities more resilient

00:04:41.446 --> 00:04:43.046
to natural disasters.

00:04:43.046 --> 00:04:46.025
And as the rising sea levels 
caused by climate change

00:04:46.025 --> 00:04:48.855
threaten low-lying cities 
across the world,

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:53.936
the Netherlands offers an exceptional 
example of how to go with the flow.
