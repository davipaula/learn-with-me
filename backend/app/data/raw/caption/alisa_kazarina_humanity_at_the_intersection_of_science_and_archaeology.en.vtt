00:00:17.463 --> 00:00:21.692
Imagine a parallel universe

00:00:21.692 --> 00:00:26.285
that coexists in the same place
as our universe,

00:00:26.285 --> 00:00:29.757
in the same space, at the same time.

00:00:30.547 --> 00:00:34.381
This universe is overcrowded
with life forms.

00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:39.377
It is invisible and intangible
like the finest layer of reality,

00:00:39.377 --> 00:00:41.034
which we cannot notice.

00:00:41.484 --> 00:00:43.320
But it is there,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.528
and it maintains the functionality
of our everyday world.

00:00:46.998 --> 00:00:50.530
Without it, we just wouldn't exist.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.955
Now, would you be surprised

00:00:52.955 --> 00:00:56.722
if I told you that actually everything
I said before is true?

00:00:57.322 --> 00:00:59.465
Because I'm about to tell you this.

00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:03.824
I'm talking about the world of microbes -

00:01:03.824 --> 00:01:07.077
a separate world,
yet so deeply connected to us.

00:01:07.757 --> 00:01:13.494
And the story of this connection
expands far away into the past.

00:01:13.494 --> 00:01:15.705
But thanks to modern science,

00:01:15.705 --> 00:01:19.916
we are now able to read this story
like a history book.

00:01:20.826 --> 00:01:27.019
Ladies and gentlemen,
I proudly present biomolecular archeology,

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:29.990
the science behind this history book.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.512
And I am here to share with you
what fascinating things

00:01:33.512 --> 00:01:37.524
we can try to manage
with this powerful modern science.

00:01:38.484 --> 00:01:43.428
But let's start with the term itself:
biomolecular archeology.

00:01:43.428 --> 00:01:45.035
It's not even easy to pronounce,

00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:48.981
not to mention to try to understand
the essence of this phrase.

00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:52.681
There might not be a problem
with the archeology part, right?

00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:56.068
We've all seen it in movies,
we know what it is about,

00:01:56.068 --> 00:01:59.063
but what is "biomolecular" anyway?

00:01:59.063 --> 00:02:00.834
The first thing that comes to mind:

00:02:00.834 --> 00:02:03.737
it is something about biology
and molecules.

00:02:03.737 --> 00:02:05.944
And this is actually correct.

00:02:05.944 --> 00:02:08.513
A biological molecule, or a biomolecule,

00:02:08.513 --> 00:02:11.814
is any molecule that is present
in a living organism.

00:02:12.384 --> 00:02:15.674
Now, there are all sorts
of molecules in your body,

00:02:15.674 --> 00:02:20.807
but undoubtedly,
the most informative one is DNA.

00:02:21.437 --> 00:02:23.534
So, let's bring it back together.

00:02:23.534 --> 00:02:27.995
Biomolecular archeology
enables us to study the DNA

00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:30.612
recovered from archeological samples.

00:02:30.612 --> 00:02:32.760
And not only native human DNA,

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.843
which, of course, all by itself
gives lots of study perspectives,

00:02:36.843 --> 00:02:41.889
but also the DNA of microbes
that lived side by side with that human.

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:44.598
This science is relatively young.

00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:46.124
About ten years ago,

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:49.756
a massive breakthrough happened
in genomic research technology.

00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:56.142
A method appeared which is called NGS,
next generation sequencing,

00:02:56.142 --> 00:03:01.264
and this method significantly cuts
time and costs of any genomic research.

00:03:01.944 --> 00:03:06.739
For example, have you ever heard
about the Human Genome Project?

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.574
It was quite a popular topic
for science fiction some time ago.

00:03:10.574 --> 00:03:14.886
This project launched in 1990
with the goal to decrypt

00:03:14.886 --> 00:03:18.175
all genomic information
in a human organism.

00:03:18.175 --> 00:03:20.642
At that time,
with the technology of the time,

00:03:20.642 --> 00:03:23.520
it took ten years
and three billion dollars

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.830
to reach the goals of this project.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.914
With NGS,

00:03:26.914 --> 00:03:32.549
all of that can be done in just one day
at the cost of 15,000 dollars.

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.554
On the fertile soil
of next generation sequencing

00:03:35.554 --> 00:03:38.348
arose biomolecular archeology

00:03:38.348 --> 00:03:44.673
because there is a great lot
of genomic information to be analyzed

00:03:44.673 --> 00:03:46.655
and it just wouldn't be possible

00:03:46.655 --> 00:03:49.842
to manage such research
with olden day technology.

00:03:49.842 --> 00:03:54.309
Now we are able
to manage such research OK,

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:56.561
"But why?" you could ask me.

00:03:56.561 --> 00:03:59.547
"What benefits can we get
out of this information?

00:03:59.547 --> 00:04:01.252
What can we use it for?"

00:04:01.252 --> 00:04:04.023
The answer appears to be quite wide.

00:04:04.273 --> 00:04:08.706
Consider human health
as a complex and dynamic system.

00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:13.502
Apart from genetically determined factors
that are stored in our DNA,

00:04:13.502 --> 00:04:17.609
our health is severely influenced
by many other factors,

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.699
like our lifestyle, our diet,
and our fellow microbes.

00:04:24.239 --> 00:04:28.503
One hundred trillion cells,
one and 14 zeros,

00:04:28.503 --> 00:04:32.601
that's the approximate number
of microorganisms in your body,

00:04:32.601 --> 00:04:35.828
ten times greater
than the number of your own cells.

00:04:35.828 --> 00:04:40.224
Your microbial baggage occupies
almost 2% of your body weight,

00:04:40.224 --> 00:04:42.966
that's about one and a half kilograms,

00:04:42.976 --> 00:04:45.656
approximately the weight of your liver.

00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:48.387
Or your brain.

00:04:49.107 --> 00:04:53.504
And all these are microbes.
Just think about it for a second!

00:04:53.504 --> 00:04:55.938
Human microbiome, that's the modern term

00:04:55.938 --> 00:04:58.818
for all microbial communities
inhabiting your body,

00:04:58.818 --> 00:05:02.038
has earned a close attention
over the last decade.

00:05:02.038 --> 00:05:05.906
It seems that we are only beginning
to discover the mysterious role

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:09.085
that is given to microbes
in the performance of our health.

00:05:09.085 --> 00:05:12.142
In 2007, the National Institutes
of Health of the U.S.

00:05:12.142 --> 00:05:14.412
launched the Human Microbiome Project

00:05:14.412 --> 00:05:17.705
to finally study its relation
to our health conditions.

00:05:17.705 --> 00:05:19.069
And since then,

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:24.358
it has only become clearer
that our notion about our fellow microbes

00:05:24.358 --> 00:05:27.002
is inexcusably poor.

00:05:27.002 --> 00:05:30.152
Francis Collins, the director
of the National Institutes of Health,

00:05:30.152 --> 00:05:33.105
even compared the researchers
involved in the project

00:05:33.105 --> 00:05:35.659
with the 15th century explorers

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:37.992
discovering the outline
of a new continent.

00:05:38.892 --> 00:05:40.185
It is now being suggested

00:05:40.185 --> 00:05:42.834
that a range of modern,
widespread diseases,

00:05:42.834 --> 00:05:48.262
starting from obesity, Crohn's disease,
other gastrointestinal problems

00:05:48.262 --> 00:05:51.546
to all sorts of allergies,
autoimmune diseases,

00:05:51.546 --> 00:05:54.385
or maybe even cancer,

00:05:54.385 --> 00:05:57.442
may appear to be consequences
of microbiome changes.

00:05:58.162 --> 00:06:00.933
But where do these changes come from?

00:06:00.933 --> 00:06:02.946
When did they first appear?

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:05.246
What was the triggering factor?

00:06:05.836 --> 00:06:09.394
These are the questions we are trying
to find answers to at the moment.

00:06:09.394 --> 00:06:11.821
This topic always triggers a memory

00:06:11.821 --> 00:06:16.197
of my first conscious experience
with the microbial world around.

00:06:16.857 --> 00:06:22.095
My mother, like any attentive parent,
tried her best to warn me

00:06:22.095 --> 00:06:25.170
against the invisible dangers
of the world,

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.580
and she told me a story

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.336
that every time I do not wash hands
before eating something,

00:06:31.336 --> 00:06:35.754
I become a reason
of global microbial migration.

00:06:35.754 --> 00:06:36.790
(Laughter)

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.220
An uncountable number
of microbial families

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.753
come together, pack their suitcases,
their TVs, their favorite toys,

00:06:43.753 --> 00:06:45.903
and leave their houses forever

00:06:45.903 --> 00:06:50.440
to move to a new area
which is thought to be my body.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:55.522
Now, I was a child
with a very vivid imagination,

00:06:55.522 --> 00:06:58.257
and this story influenced me so much

00:06:58.257 --> 00:07:02.470
that I was obsessed with handwashing
for a really long time.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.513
It actually took me years
to overcome the thought

00:07:05.513 --> 00:07:09.907
that I'm doing something wrong
when I initiate this microbial migration,

00:07:09.907 --> 00:07:14.193
and to understand finally
that they are actually willing to come,

00:07:14.193 --> 00:07:16.856
they've got friends there
waiting for them.

00:07:17.666 --> 00:07:21.842
I'm not trying to convince you
not to ever wash your hands again,

00:07:21.842 --> 00:07:23.362
of course not.

00:07:23.362 --> 00:07:26.323
But let's try to be moderate with it.

00:07:26.323 --> 00:07:29.585
We lack this microbial diversity nowadays.

00:07:29.985 --> 00:07:32.032
And as we know from ecology,

00:07:32.032 --> 00:07:35.499
the most diverse systems
are the most stable ones.

00:07:36.299 --> 00:07:39.146
This might be one of the reasons

00:07:39.146 --> 00:07:41.919
for our so-called
diseases of civilization.

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:47.490
And this is exactly the type of hypothesis
for biomolecular archeology to deal with.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:52.782
It turns out that there is
a unique archaeological material

00:07:52.782 --> 00:07:56.430
that so preciously stores
the enormous amount of information

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:59.514
related to ancient human microbiome,

00:07:59.514 --> 00:08:02.846
and this material
is ancient dental plaque,

00:08:02.846 --> 00:08:04.948
thanks to the fact
that oral cavity hygiene

00:08:04.948 --> 00:08:08.151
was not on the list of top priorities
for humans of the past.

00:08:08.151 --> 00:08:13.229
Their oral microbiome has already been
partly fossilized during their lifetime

00:08:13.229 --> 00:08:15.452
in the form of dental calculus,

00:08:15.452 --> 00:08:17.714
which, in turn, stays in soil

00:08:17.714 --> 00:08:21.174
as well preserved
as the skeletons themselves.

00:08:21.174 --> 00:08:24.666
Sadly, we can't help these fellas anymore.

00:08:24.666 --> 00:08:28.914
But they can help us by providing
unique and precious information

00:08:28.914 --> 00:08:31.994
about their microbes and their health,

00:08:31.994 --> 00:08:35.944
and maybe we will have a chance to help
others in the future thanks to them.

00:08:36.314 --> 00:08:40.114
There is one more vast
human health-related aspect

00:08:40.114 --> 00:08:44.125
where biomolecular archaeology
takes its rightful place,

00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:46.044
and this field of research

00:08:46.044 --> 00:08:51.769
expands into the valley
of ancient deadly pathogens.

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:53.755
It is true

00:08:53.755 --> 00:08:57.543
that the vast majority of microbes
either provide us some kind of benefit

00:08:57.543 --> 00:09:00.413
or do not really care
whether there is a human around.

00:09:00.913 --> 00:09:04.160
But there are some ancient deadly microbes

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.974
that still remain an urgent problem
nowadays all around the world.

00:09:09.974 --> 00:09:12.806
For example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

00:09:13.446 --> 00:09:16.520
One and a half million deaths in 2014.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.267
And OK, OK, I know,

00:09:19.267 --> 00:09:23.869
the first reaction I always get is like,
"Wait, aren't there antibiotics?"

00:09:23.869 --> 00:09:27.221
or "I heard there is even a vaccine;

00:09:27.221 --> 00:09:30.056
is this disease still dangerous
to us after all?"

00:09:30.486 --> 00:09:35.445
The answer is yes;
tuberculosis is closer than you think.

00:09:35.445 --> 00:09:39.142
Because of some mysterious
genetic phenomenon,

00:09:39.142 --> 00:09:43.589
there are people that can carry around
this microbe their entire lives

00:09:43.589 --> 00:09:45.835
without developing any symptoms,

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:50.502
and there are people that develop symptoms
straight ahead after infection.

00:09:50.502 --> 00:09:54.984
Let me give you a real example
of a tuberculosis microepidemic.

00:09:54.984 --> 00:09:57.791
Let's say a person somehow got infected.

00:09:57.791 --> 00:10:00.712
He works as a teacher in a junior school.

00:10:01.062 --> 00:10:04.758
Half a year later,
one of his pupils develops symptoms.

00:10:04.758 --> 00:10:07.483
A few months later,
the older sister of the pupil.

00:10:07.483 --> 00:10:11.035
A few more months later,
two friends of the sister.

00:10:11.035 --> 00:10:12.725
This is how it spreads.

00:10:12.725 --> 00:10:15.398
When I was just starting
my research on this topic,

00:10:15.398 --> 00:10:17.622
I myself was very surprised to know

00:10:17.622 --> 00:10:22.617
that tuberculosis worldwide remains
one of the major health concerns,

00:10:22.617 --> 00:10:25.096
that on the list of infectious diseases,

00:10:25.096 --> 00:10:29.080
it is the second most common
death cause after HIV.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.632
Yes, the fight continues.

00:10:30.632 --> 00:10:34.833
Did you know we have a tuberculosis clinic
right here in Latvia, just outside Riga,

00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:39.236
where many doctors and other specialists
fight tuberculosis on a daily basis?

00:10:39.236 --> 00:10:42.095
To finally beat this harmful bacteria,

00:10:42.095 --> 00:10:45.554
it is crucial to understand
how it evolved,

00:10:45.554 --> 00:10:48.057
how it developed
resistance to antibiotics,

00:10:48.057 --> 00:10:49.927
how it spread.

00:10:49.927 --> 00:10:51.232
And these are the questions

00:10:51.232 --> 00:10:54.819
where biomolecular archaeology
can help us a lot.

00:10:54.819 --> 00:10:58.763
At the moment, working in the Latvian
Biomedical Research and Study Centre,

00:10:58.763 --> 00:11:01.746
we have managed to identify
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

00:11:01.746 --> 00:11:05.063
in one archaeological sample
from the 17th century.

00:11:05.063 --> 00:11:08.086
We are now in the process
of defining its whole genome,

00:11:08.086 --> 00:11:09.344
so we can understand

00:11:09.344 --> 00:11:13.979
what type of tuberculosis reigned
at that time over the Latvian territories

00:11:13.979 --> 00:11:15.840
and where it came from.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.675
Obviously, biomolecular archaeology
impacts humanities as well,

00:11:20.675 --> 00:11:23.122
such as history and anthropology.

00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:27.025
These, for example, are the excavations
on the Saint Ģertrūdes Cemetery

00:11:27.025 --> 00:11:28.511
a few years ago.

00:11:28.511 --> 00:11:30.704
They started very spontaneously.

00:11:30.704 --> 00:11:33.925
There was an idea to build
a shopping center in that area,

00:11:33.925 --> 00:11:35.847
and there was also information

00:11:35.847 --> 00:11:39.332
that there might be
some medieval burial sites.

00:11:39.332 --> 00:11:43.918
So the Latvian Institute of History
received a request to check it out.

00:11:43.918 --> 00:11:48.190
And they did actually find
a medieval burial site,

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:49.965
quite a massive one.

00:11:49.965 --> 00:11:53.473
Our archaeologists
dug out over 500 skeletons,

00:11:53.473 --> 00:11:58.779
and found 2,000 more skeletons
buried separately in a giant wooden box.

00:11:58.779 --> 00:12:00.202
But what was it?

00:12:00.202 --> 00:12:06.175
This couldn't be war because the skeletons
lacked war lesions on their bones.

00:12:06.175 --> 00:12:08.758
Was it hunger? Epidemic?

00:12:09.138 --> 00:12:11.935
Archaeology itself cannot take
this research any further,

00:12:11.935 --> 00:12:15.356
we have to intervene
with biomolecular methods.

00:12:15.356 --> 00:12:17.621
Only then can we trace the true reason.

00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:21.558
The research process that implements
the goals of the science

00:12:21.558 --> 00:12:24.080
is fascinating, even by itself.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:28.821
It all starts with ancient bones and teeth
from cemeteries all around Latvia.

00:12:28.821 --> 00:12:31.479
We then cut out
small pieces of these bones

00:12:31.479 --> 00:12:36.562
and shred them in special scientific mills
to get bone powder.

00:12:36.562 --> 00:12:38.831
We then extract all the DNA

00:12:38.831 --> 00:12:41.956
that is captured in a specific
bone powder sample,

00:12:41.956 --> 00:12:43.565
and then we sequence it.

00:12:43.565 --> 00:12:47.877
Sequencing is the process
where the machine reads the DNA code

00:12:47.877 --> 00:12:50.925
and translates it into a four-letter code.

00:12:51.465 --> 00:12:53.388
By the way, it is absolutely fascinating

00:12:53.388 --> 00:12:55.905
how all genetic information
of human beings

00:12:55.905 --> 00:12:58.323
and all other living creatures
on the planet Earth

00:12:58.323 --> 00:13:02.426
can be written down using the alphabet
containing four letters only.

00:13:03.066 --> 00:13:04.706
It's absolutely not surprising

00:13:04.706 --> 00:13:09.501
that the result of the sequencing
is absolutely unreadable -

00:13:09.501 --> 00:13:13.327
gigabytes of text
consisting of these four letters.

00:13:13.327 --> 00:13:16.735
It then takes time and effort
to analyze these data

00:13:16.735 --> 00:13:20.487
with a variety of computational methods
and programming approaches.

00:13:20.487 --> 00:13:24.167
And at the very end,
we get a pretty readable list

00:13:24.167 --> 00:13:27.147
of all the microorganisms
from a specific sample.

00:13:27.147 --> 00:13:32.177
The field of my research
contains three sciences at once:

00:13:32.797 --> 00:13:39.210
archaeology, biology and computer science,
all mixed, merged and connected.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.248
It's like the science itself

00:13:41.248 --> 00:13:44.697
merging and connecting humanity
throughout centuries.

00:13:45.147 --> 00:13:47.438
Science is like a pyramid:

00:13:47.438 --> 00:13:48.868
you cannot lay the upper block

00:13:48.868 --> 00:13:51.481
without a foundation
of the blocks beneath.

00:13:51.481 --> 00:13:56.351
And building this pyramid of healthcare
throughout the entire human civilization,

00:13:56.351 --> 00:14:01.098
I believe biomolecular archaeology
just opened up a new frontier for us.

00:14:02.018 --> 00:14:03.932
Where do we go from here?

00:14:03.932 --> 00:14:06.011
It's a question of choice,

00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:09.987
but I believe that any destination
holds fascinating discoveries.

00:14:09.987 --> 00:14:14.345
But just for now, please remember
that you are never alone.

00:14:14.345 --> 00:14:15.353
(Laughter)

00:14:15.353 --> 00:14:18.760
You've got a hundred trillion friends
that are always there for you.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.371
Think about it next time
you want to wash your hands.

00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:22.412
Thank you.

00:14:22.412 --> 00:14:23.950
(Applause)
