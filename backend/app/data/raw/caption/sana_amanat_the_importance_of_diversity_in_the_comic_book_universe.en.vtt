00:00:24.592 --> 00:00:30.016
Now, I am actually going to do something
that you guys do every single day.

00:00:30.016 --> 00:00:34.442
I'm going to ask you guys
to judge me right now.

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:37.022
The Bumbys were just doing it;
it's very appropriate.

00:00:37.022 --> 00:00:40.152
Take a good look,
and describe me in your head.

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:46.048
Now, based on those descriptions, 
how would you categorize me?

00:00:46.048 --> 00:00:47.763
By my height?

00:00:47.763 --> 00:00:49.311
By my skin color?

00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:50.679
By my hair?

00:00:51.452 --> 00:00:57.921
Now, would any of those descriptions
scream comic-book editor?

00:00:58.071 --> 00:01:01.161
Maybe my t-shirt, actually;
I think that might have given it away.

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.209
But no, probably not.

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:05.829
I'm actually one of the few South Asian,
female comic-book editors out there.

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:08.344
I think, actually,
I might be the only one,

00:01:08.344 --> 00:01:11.503
so for any of you South Asian females
interested, it's a good gig.

00:01:11.503 --> 00:01:13.026
I highly recommend it.

00:01:13.026 --> 00:01:14.594
Holler at my ladies? No?

00:01:14.594 --> 00:01:16.104
All right, that's cool.

00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:20.623
Now, what I do as a comic-book editor
is I make things up.

00:01:20.623 --> 00:01:21.766
I work with creators

00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:26.148
to tell the most uncanny,
amazing, sensational stories

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.778
about seemingly ordinary individuals

00:01:28.778 --> 00:01:31.937
who come to possess
extraordinary identities.

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:35.047
We call them superheroes.

00:01:35.047 --> 00:01:37.461
Now, when I was first asked
to speak at this event,

00:01:37.461 --> 00:01:40.958
it was actually after the announcement
of a character I had co-created:

00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.155
Ms. Marvel, the all-new Ms. Marvel,

00:01:43.172 --> 00:01:46.539
was the first Muslim American superhero 
to have her own series.

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.454
It really was the most obvious thing 
in the world in my mind.

00:01:49.454 --> 00:01:53.329
I had created a character 
that I could identify with.

00:01:53.777 --> 00:01:56.839
And yet it was quite possibly

00:01:57.019 --> 00:02:01.261
the biggest publicity that Marvel
had seen in quite some time.

00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:03.830
Parents called us,
thanking us for creating a book

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.300
that they could finally share
with their daughter.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.957
Fans called us thanking us

00:02:07.957 --> 00:02:11.287
for creating a character
that they could finally relate to.

00:02:11.287 --> 00:02:14.129
We'd clearly tapped
into something really powerful,

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.953
something people had been craving 
for quite some time.

00:02:18.223 --> 00:02:23.403
And yet it was the simplest idea, 
just masked as the craziest.

00:02:23.964 --> 00:02:26.927
Now, to understand
the origins of Ms. Marvel,

00:02:26.927 --> 00:02:29.151
we have to take a trip

00:02:29.621 --> 00:02:32.595
to a land far, far away,

00:02:32.595 --> 00:02:33.920
[It was New Jersey]

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.943
(Laughter)

00:02:34.943 --> 00:02:36.841
a long, long time ago,

00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:39.426
where - come on -

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:44.301
where a young girl with a cowlick
and bad taste in clothes

00:02:45.074 --> 00:02:46.729
never felt like she could fit in.

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:49.551
She didn't look like
the other girls in her class,

00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:53.559
couldn't eat the delicious,
delicious BLTs that they could eat.

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:56.574
She began to become fascinated with bacon.

00:02:56.574 --> 00:02:57.970
What is that delicious meat?

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.350
She had no idea.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.380
Her parents weren't on the PTA.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.050
She didn't get Christmas presents.

00:03:06.751 --> 00:03:11.407
And in fact, she had to wear a t-shirt 
over her bathing suit

00:03:11.407 --> 00:03:13.637
every single time she swam.

00:03:13.637 --> 00:03:15.488
So clearly this girl was different.

00:03:15.488 --> 00:03:17.193
But she did have an outlet,

00:03:17.193 --> 00:03:19.388
and it wasn't her parents, who she adored,

00:03:19.388 --> 00:03:21.567
who just didn't quite understand her yet,

00:03:21.877 --> 00:03:23.506
or her three older brothers,

00:03:23.506 --> 00:03:25.776
who were too busy
with hair gel and light sabers

00:03:25.776 --> 00:03:27.236
to pay any attention to her.

00:03:27.236 --> 00:03:29.744
It was something else
altogether different.

00:03:29.744 --> 00:03:32.465
It was the X-Men.

00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:35.016
Yes! Yes!

00:03:35.016 --> 00:03:37.056
(Applause)

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.628
The X-Men were mutants,

00:03:41.628 --> 00:03:46.846
individuals with mutated and enhanced
genes that triggered in adolescence,

00:03:46.846 --> 00:03:48.848
giving them superpowers.

00:03:48.848 --> 00:03:51.717
It was the coolest thing in the world.

00:03:51.717 --> 00:03:55.376
A woman with brown skin and white hair
who can manipulate the weather,

00:03:55.376 --> 00:03:58.563
a gigantic beast of a man with blue fur,

00:03:58.563 --> 00:04:02.353
a shy girl with a Southern drawl
who couldn't touch anyone.

00:04:02.353 --> 00:04:06.373
So these people were
that little girl's safe place.

00:04:06.595 --> 00:04:10.565
These people she understood
because they, too, were different.

00:04:10.565 --> 00:04:16.521
And it also helped that they
also wore ridiculous-looking outfits.

00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:20.947
I don't know, Mom, I have no idea
what you were doing in that picture.

00:04:20.947 --> 00:04:22.167
I apologize.

00:04:22.968 --> 00:04:27.348
So, the X-Men embraced who they are.

00:04:28.168 --> 00:04:33.204
Adamantium claws, weird
weather-controlling habits, mutations.

00:04:33.204 --> 00:04:34.206
They owned it:

00:04:34.206 --> 00:04:37.368
they knew who they were,
and they would defend it, no matter what.

00:04:37.373 --> 00:04:39.501
So every Saturday morning,

00:04:39.501 --> 00:04:43.194
when this little girl used to rush
down the stairs to watch that show,

00:04:43.424 --> 00:04:45.880
she felt a little less alone

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.131
because they had fulfilled a need
to see herself in the world outside.

00:04:50.431 --> 00:04:53.341
So, let's talk about why that need
existed in the first place.

00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:56.598
Now, remember when I was asking 
you guys earlier about categories?

00:04:56.778 --> 00:05:00.046
Why don't you guys think about
the categories that you all belong to.

00:05:00.046 --> 00:05:02.124
I'm going to do that up here for myself.

00:05:02.124 --> 00:05:07.257
So, I am a Muslim, a woman,
an American, a comic book editor,

00:05:07.257 --> 00:05:10.108
a short person, a lazy person, a nerd -

00:05:10.108 --> 00:05:11.450
you can ignore that, though.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.281
Now, the strange thing
about defining yourself in this way

00:05:14.281 --> 00:05:17.013
is that it simplifies who you are.

00:05:17.013 --> 00:05:20.843
How can everything that I am
be encompassed into a label?

00:05:21.213 --> 00:05:23.873
Now, some of these labels
we choose for ourselves,

00:05:23.873 --> 00:05:27.523
others we're born into
and others are assigned for us.

00:05:27.523 --> 00:05:31.026
But regardless, all of them
come with preconceived notions -

00:05:31.026 --> 00:05:32.559
assumptions and expectations -

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:33.930
of what they mean.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.960
So if I'm Muslim,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.080
people may expect that I cover my head,

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.445
that I don't associate with men,

00:05:41.595 --> 00:05:43.590
that I don't drink alcohol.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.617
Others may assume that I'm a terrorist -

00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:49.507
I'm not -

00:05:50.177 --> 00:05:52.316
that I hate Americans.

00:05:52.316 --> 00:05:55.511
Well, I'm an American,
so I certainly don't hate myself,

00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:56.917
sometimes.

00:05:56.917 --> 00:05:58.965
I'm an oppressed woman.

00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:01.523
I'm way too stubborn for that.

00:06:01.523 --> 00:06:04.881
You can ask my poor parents;
they deal with it every day.

00:06:05.471 --> 00:06:10.227
Now, because we allow others
to create these definitions for us,

00:06:10.227 --> 00:06:12.524
we inherently accept them to be true,

00:06:12.524 --> 00:06:14.482
whether it's a conscious decision or not.

00:06:14.482 --> 00:06:18.822
So at some point, the line between
perspective and reality begins to blur.

00:06:18.822 --> 00:06:22.002
When we are told by others,
constantly and incessantly, who we are,

00:06:22.002 --> 00:06:24.151
when we allow others to define ourselves -

00:06:24.151 --> 00:06:27.177
whether it's the media, 
our parents, our friends -

00:06:27.177 --> 00:06:32.229
we begin to accept a standard of self
that is not of our own choosing.

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:36.311
We become a splintered version
of the person we are destined to be.

00:06:36.311 --> 00:06:39.248
I remember in junior high school -

00:06:40.268 --> 00:06:43.360
it was actually right after
the first World Trade Center bombing,

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.969
and it was a very confusing time for me
for a bunch of reasons,

00:06:48.609 --> 00:06:51.855
but in particular
because it was the first time

00:06:51.855 --> 00:06:55.083
my religion was made
synonymous with violence

00:06:55.083 --> 00:06:57.013
in such a public way.

00:06:57.661 --> 00:06:59.954
I'd walked into school the next morning,

00:06:59.954 --> 00:07:02.544
and a classmate who I'd never
actually talked to before

00:07:02.544 --> 00:07:04.046
tapped me on the shoulder, 

00:07:04.046 --> 00:07:10.576
and he said, "Hey, tell your people
to stop attacking us."

00:07:11.555 --> 00:07:15.138
I was confused, hurt, stunned.

00:07:15.578 --> 00:07:16.761
"Us?"

00:07:16.861 --> 00:07:18.704
I thought I was "us."

00:07:19.084 --> 00:07:23.112
I certainly wasn't "them," was I?

00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:25.631
That would be the first time

00:07:25.631 --> 00:07:29.333
that I saw the way the world viewed
the category I belonged to.

00:07:29.703 --> 00:07:33.230
Names like Muhammed, Ahmed, Sharif,

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.984
names I had grown up with all of my life

00:07:35.984 --> 00:07:42.304
were equated with terms
like "terrorist," "hate monger," "enemy."

00:07:42.304 --> 00:07:46.568
I was angry at those men who had warped
my faith into a vengeful weapon,

00:07:46.568 --> 00:07:51.738
and at the same time at the media
for propagating those stereotypes.

00:07:51.738 --> 00:07:54.356
I swung from self-defense to self-doubt,

00:07:54.356 --> 00:07:55.955
pride to shame.

00:07:56.335 --> 00:08:00.445
Who was I? What side was I on?
Where did I fit in?

00:08:00.745 --> 00:08:02.653
I had no idea.

00:08:02.853 --> 00:08:05.445
For years, I had
constantly measured myself

00:08:05.445 --> 00:08:07.952
against images
that looked nothing like me.

00:08:07.952 --> 00:08:13.095
I didn't see myself in the TV,
in the classroom or in magazines.

00:08:13.197 --> 00:08:19.186
And suddenly, my face was everywhere
with a big red X painted over it.

00:08:19.717 --> 00:08:24.407
Why did I feel so uncertain
and insecure about my identity?

00:08:26.577 --> 00:08:30.398
I'm going to throw some
social-psychological jargon out at you

00:08:30.398 --> 00:08:32.560
to make myself sound really smart.

00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:35.477
There's something
called a "stereotype threat,"

00:08:35.487 --> 00:08:38.434
and what it says is that individuals
of a particular group

00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:42.648
internalize and react to the negative
stereotypes associated with that group.

00:08:42.648 --> 00:08:45.013
So because I'm so afraid
of everybody thinking

00:08:45.013 --> 00:08:48.504
that all those bad things
that people say about me are true,

00:08:48.504 --> 00:08:51.007
sometimes, I don't act
to the best of my abilities.

00:08:51.007 --> 00:08:52.547
I underperform.

00:08:52.618 --> 00:08:56.338
Whether it's academically, socially -

00:08:56.338 --> 00:08:58.736
I was definitely
an introvert for a reason.

00:08:59.566 --> 00:09:05.046
And basically what that means
is that you act against your true nature

00:09:05.046 --> 00:09:09.207
because you're constantly trying
to live up to other people's expectations

00:09:09.216 --> 00:09:11.526
or deny their assumptions.

00:09:12.222 --> 00:09:15.645
You mask who you truly are.

00:09:16.095 --> 00:09:19.010
So, how to we deflect these threats?

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.235
Yes, you're right: with more jargon!

00:09:21.235 --> 00:09:24.915
There is something
called a "mirror-neuron theory."

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.054
What it means is that your brain neurons
react in the same way,

00:09:28.054 --> 00:09:30.463
whether or not you
are the one doing the action.

00:09:30.463 --> 00:09:35.230
So, if I'm watching you
eat a really delicious cheeseburger,

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.092
my brain is reacting in the same way

00:09:37.092 --> 00:09:40.470
as if I was eating that really delicious
cheeseburger myself.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:41.851
Which is why the Food Network

00:09:41.851 --> 00:09:44.520
is quite possibly the greatest
programming of all time.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.350
Only show I watch!

00:09:47.268 --> 00:09:49.519
Now, imagine if what we saw on the media

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:53.484
reflected a positive portrayal
of the group that we belonged to.

00:09:53.684 --> 00:09:55.319
How would our brains react?

00:09:55.336 --> 00:09:57.396
How would our perceptions change?

00:09:57.646 --> 00:10:01.056
That was the secret of the success
of the show "The Cosby Show,"

00:10:01.056 --> 00:10:03.024
the groundbreaking and intelligent sitcom

00:10:03.024 --> 00:10:06.204
that truly helped to adjust
perception of African Americans.

00:10:06.204 --> 00:10:07.954
It was the first of its kind.

00:10:07.954 --> 00:10:11.715
By focusing on the comedic
trials and tribulations

00:10:11.715 --> 00:10:16.955
of a successful and lovable family
that just happened to be African American,

00:10:16.955 --> 00:10:19.918
it took away those
limiting qualifiers of race

00:10:19.918 --> 00:10:25.258
and helped to redefine what it meant
to just be an American family,

00:10:25.518 --> 00:10:29.327
all through the power of story.

00:10:30.823 --> 00:10:35.963
Now while we look to the media to bring us
the stark realities of humankind,

00:10:35.963 --> 00:10:39.995
we seek stories to find
some emotional connectivity with it.

00:10:39.995 --> 00:10:43.571
Stories give us a glimpse into
the inner workings of the human spirit,

00:10:43.571 --> 00:10:46.138
its pitfalls and its potentials.

00:10:46.138 --> 00:10:51.148
And they stir within us a desire
to reach the excesses of our imagination.

00:10:51.148 --> 00:10:55.795
They challenge us and force us to look
at one another for who we truly are

00:10:55.795 --> 00:10:58.777
in the hopes of possibly
connecting our souls,

00:10:58.777 --> 00:11:01.958
and for that reason, they are sacred.

00:11:01.958 --> 00:11:03.845
And at the same time,

00:11:03.845 --> 00:11:07.063
they can be the shields
against the threats to our soul,

00:11:07.163 --> 00:11:09.221
threats to our identity.

00:11:09.221 --> 00:11:11.225
So what the mirror-neuron theory is saying

00:11:11.225 --> 00:11:14.743
is that it's human nature
to follow the actions of the masses.

00:11:14.743 --> 00:11:18.051
We repeat and/or believe
what people tell us to believe -

00:11:18.051 --> 00:11:21.131
about others and about ourselves.

00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:26.761
So why not tell stories
that are empowering and aspirational

00:11:26.761 --> 00:11:29.746
and challenge us to be better?

00:11:30.516 --> 00:11:31.911
(Applause)

00:11:38.655 --> 00:11:42.845
That is exactly what superhero stories do.

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:49.364
The history of comics is about the misfit,

00:11:49.364 --> 00:11:50.784
the unlikely hero,

00:11:50.784 --> 00:11:54.330
the ability to create greatness
where there was once doubt.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.375
The unassuming Peter Parker,

00:11:56.375 --> 00:11:59.360
the wallflower who's picked on
and misunderstood,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.338
gets bitten by a radioactive spider

00:12:02.338 --> 00:12:07.928
that gives him extraordinary powers
and extraordinary responsibilities.

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:12.782
Yet his path is filled with villains
who would doubt his determination,

00:12:12.782 --> 00:12:15.522
who would threaten those he loves,

00:12:15.522 --> 00:12:17.722
threaten his life choices.

00:12:18.793 --> 00:12:25.213
And yet Spider-Man, being the hero
that he is, would always swing back,

00:12:25.815 --> 00:12:28.180
he'd always beat the bad guy

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.805
and he'd always get the girl.

00:12:31.168 --> 00:12:34.413
Or girls, in Spider-Man's case.

00:12:34.413 --> 00:12:36.438
Lots of love drama there.

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:44.010
For 75 years, Marvel has been telling
the tale of the outcast behind the mask.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.858
It's through his flaws and desires that we
connect with the heart of the character

00:12:47.858 --> 00:12:52.638
so that when he emerges as a hero,
we have a real reason to champion him

00:12:52.638 --> 00:12:55.902
because we understand
those struggles too, don't we?

00:12:55.902 --> 00:12:58.372
And we also want to move past them.

00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:02.515
Heroes make a choice to fight injustice,
to protect the innocent,

00:13:02.515 --> 00:13:05.382
to put the balance back
on the side of the good,

00:13:05.382 --> 00:13:08.131
no matter how much
they sacrifice of themselves.

00:13:08.131 --> 00:13:12.308
They're willing to die for it
because they've chosen who they are.

00:13:12.308 --> 00:13:16.228
And they will defend it no matter what.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.949
So when that little girl
sat rapt to attention,

00:13:20.949 --> 00:13:23.578
all those years ago
at her television screen,

00:13:23.848 --> 00:13:25.433
watching the X-Men,

00:13:25.433 --> 00:13:30.323
it wasn't just because they had taken her
on an astonishing adventure.

00:13:30.323 --> 00:13:33.907
It's because they told her
that it was okay to be different.

00:13:33.907 --> 00:13:36.170
In fact, you had to fight for it.

00:13:36.858 --> 00:13:39.346
Because we all
want to be heroes, don't we?

00:13:39.346 --> 00:13:44.006
And wouldn't it be amazing
if heroes looked just like us?

00:13:44.201 --> 00:13:49.731
So why does a character like Kamala Khan
resonate with so many people?

00:13:50.071 --> 00:13:54.727
Like the first African-American
and Latino Spider-Man, Miles Morales,

00:13:54.727 --> 00:13:57.977
Kamala Khan is so much larger
than just a pop-culture icon.

00:13:57.977 --> 00:13:59.107
She came together

00:13:59.107 --> 00:14:03.497
in response to that global
subconscious desire for representation

00:14:03.498 --> 00:14:08.618
for those Muslim American,
bacon-sniffing, short, nerdy girls like me

00:14:08.798 --> 00:14:10.402
and for anyone else,

00:14:10.402 --> 00:14:14.617
regardless of their gender,
sexuality, race, religion,

00:14:14.617 --> 00:14:17.702
who just feel like misfits themselves.

00:14:17.702 --> 00:14:21.467
In the actual Ms. Marvel series,

00:14:21.907 --> 00:14:25.702
Kamala Khan is just a girl
trying to fit in.

00:14:26.112 --> 00:14:29.789
She's constantly negotiating,
renegotiating who she is

00:14:29.789 --> 00:14:32.189
and all of the rules that come with it.

00:14:32.546 --> 00:14:34.081
Where does she belong?

00:14:34.081 --> 00:14:36.546
She has no idea.

00:14:36.764 --> 00:14:42.061
She's still figuring out
that journey to her authentic self.

00:14:42.061 --> 00:14:43.068
But all she knows

00:14:43.068 --> 00:14:47.738
is that she does not want to be limited
by the labels imposed upon her.

00:14:48.338 --> 00:14:53.048
So really, Kamala Khan's story
is everyone's.

00:14:53.528 --> 00:14:56.651
It's about confronting the labels
you've been assigned

00:14:56.651 --> 00:14:59.198
and sculpting them and redefining them

00:14:59.198 --> 00:15:05.348
until you figure out who you truly are
and what you actually believe.

00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:08.189
One of my favorite mottos -

00:15:08.203 --> 00:15:12.072
actually I have it written
on a post-it over my computer.

00:15:12.072 --> 00:15:13.517
I look at it every single day,

00:15:13.517 --> 00:15:17.192
and it was said by a poet named Rumi.

00:15:17.767 --> 00:15:18.987
And it goes,

00:15:18.987 --> 00:15:24.117
"Do not be satisfied with stories,
that which has come before.

00:15:24.637 --> 00:15:27.642
Unfold your own myth."

00:15:28.427 --> 00:15:30.775
And that is our challenge.

00:15:30.775 --> 00:15:34.855
Every single one of us,
no matter the categories we've inherited,

00:15:34.855 --> 00:15:38.282
we must unfold our own myth.

00:15:38.282 --> 00:15:40.205
And it won't be easy.

00:15:40.335 --> 00:15:44.733
We're constantly navigating,
rearranging, reinventing

00:15:44.733 --> 00:15:48.500
others' expectations
of ourselves every day.

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:52.084
But every word we write
in the narrative of our own lives,

00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:56.264
we come closer to uncovering 
what's beneath our own masks,

00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:01.780
maybe even embracing that true misfit,
that true crazy one within.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.647
Oh, it'll be a fight, that's for sure.

00:16:05.647 --> 00:16:07.787
But that battle for your soul,

00:16:08.837 --> 00:16:10.947
for your authentic self,

00:16:10.947 --> 00:16:13.987
it's worth it, isn't it?

00:16:13.987 --> 00:16:16.050
It's bold; it's brave.

00:16:16.285 --> 00:16:19.285
In fact, I would say it's heroic.

00:16:19.524 --> 00:16:22.069
So now it's your turn.

00:16:22.829 --> 00:16:24.904
Tell me your story.

00:16:25.315 --> 00:16:26.785
Thank you.

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:29.035
(Applause)
