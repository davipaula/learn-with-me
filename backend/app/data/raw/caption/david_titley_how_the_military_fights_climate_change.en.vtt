00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:16.656
So I'd like to tell you a story
about climate and change,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.346
but it's really a story about people
and not polar bears.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.176
So this is our house
that we lived in in the mid-2000s.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.976
I was the chief operating officer
for the Navy's weather and ocean service.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.896
It happened to be down at a place
called Stennis Space Center

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.176
right on the Gulf Coast,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.915
so we lived in a little town
called Waveland, Mississippi,

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:39.456
nice modest house, and as you can see,
it's up against a storm surge.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.136
Now, if you ever wonder

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.616
what a 30-foot or nine-meter
storm surge does

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.696
coming up your street,

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.336
let me show you.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.696
Same house.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.256
That's me, kind of wondering what's next.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.776
But when we say we lost our house --
this is, like, right after Katrina --

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.616
so the house is either all the way
up there in the railway tracks,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.456
or it's somewhere down there
in the Gulf of Mexico,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.656
and to this day,
we really, we lost our house.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.936
We don't know where it is.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.216
(Laughter)

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.096
You know, it's gone.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.016
So I don't show this for pity,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.456
because in many ways, we were
the luckiest people on the Gulf Coast.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.336
One of the things is, we had insurance,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.776
and that idea of insurance
is probably pretty important there.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.736
But does this scale up,
you know, what happened here?

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.016
And I think it kind of does,
because as you've heard,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.736
as the sea levels come up,

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.656
it takes weaker and weaker storms
to do something like this.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.576
So let's just step back for a second
and kind of look at this.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.176
And, you know,
climate's really complicated,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.976
a lot of moving parts in this,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.896
but I kind of put it about
it's all about the water.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.296
See, see those three blue dots
there down on the lower part?

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.616
The one you can easily see,
that's all the water in the world.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.096
Those two smaller dots,
those are the fresh water.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.456
And it turns out
that as the climate changes,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.976
the distribution of that water
is changing very fundamentally.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.736
So now we have too much, too little,
wrong place, wrong time.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.336
It's salty where it should be fresh;
it's liquid where it should be frozen;

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.936
it's wet where it should be dry;

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.735
and in fact, the very chemistry
of the ocean itself is changing.

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:27.696
And what that does
from a security or a military part

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.976
is it does three things:

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.576
it changes the very operating
environment that we're working in,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.176
it threatens our bases,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.696
and then it has geostrategic risks,
which sounds kind of fancy

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.976
and I'll explain what I mean
by that in a second.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.496
So let's go to just
a couple examples here.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.736
And we'll start off with what we all know

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.936
is of course a political
and humanitarian catastrophe

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.376
that is Syria.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.816
And it turns out that climate
was one of the causes

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.536
in a long chain of events.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.336
It actually started back in the 1970s.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.216
When Assad took control over Syria,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.376
he decided he wanted to be self-sufficient
in things like wheat and barley.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.056
Now, you would like to think

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.536
that there was somebody
in Assad's office that said,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.656
"Hey boss, you know,
we're in the eastern Mediterranean,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.136
kind of dry here,
maybe not the best idea."

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.616
But I think what happened was,

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.736
"Boss, you are a smart, powerful
and handsome man. We'll get right on it."

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.976
And they did.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.936
So by the '90s, believe it or not,

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.376
they were actually
self-sufficient in food,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.976
but they did it at a great cost.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.936
They did it at a cost of their aquifers,

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.096
they did it at a cost
of their surface water.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.336
And of course, there are
many nonclimate issues

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.056
that also contributed to Syria.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.296
There was the Iraq War,

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.736
and as you can see
by that lower blue line there,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.976
over a million refugees
come into the cities.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.736
And then about a decade ago,

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.896
there's this tremendous
heat wave and drought --

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.976
fingerprints all over that show,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.216
yes, this is in fact related
to the changing climate --

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.176
has put another three quarters
of a million farmers

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.096
into those same cities.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.600
Why? Because they had nothing.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.176
They had dust. They had dirt.
They had nothing.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.216
So now they're in the cities,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.656
the Iraqis are in the cities,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.776
it's Assad, it's not like
he's taking care of his people,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.096
and all of a sudden
we have just this huge issue here

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.376
of massive instability

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.656
and a breeding ground for extremism.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.656
And this is why in the security community

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.376
we call climate change
a risk to instability.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.656
It accelerates instability here.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.440
In plain English,
it makes bad places worse.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.896
So let's go to another place here.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.496
Now we're going to go 2,000 kilometers,
or about 1,200 miles, north of Oslo,

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.056
only 600 miles from the Pole,

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.616
and this is arguably

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.896
the most strategic island
you've never heard of.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.496
It's a place called Svalbard.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.736
It sits astride the sea lanes

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.016
that the Russian Northern Fleet needs
to get out and go into warmer waters.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.016
It is also, by virtue of its geography,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.576
a place where you can control
every single polar orbiting satellite

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.856
on every orbit.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.496
It is the strategic high ground of space.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.776
Climate change has greatly reduced
the sea ice around here,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.616
greatly increasing human activity,

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.136
and it's becoming a flashpoint,

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.216
and in fact the NATO
Parliamentary Assembly

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.256
is going to meet here
on Svalbard next month.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.016
The Russians are very,
very unhappy about that.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.696
So if you want to find
a flashpoint in the Arctic,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.360
look at Svalbard there.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.216
Now, in the military,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.576
we have known for decades,
if not centuries,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.616
that the time to prepare,

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.376
whether it's for a hurricane,
a typhoon or strategic changes,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.256
is before they hit you,

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.976
and Admiral Nimitz was right there.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.976
That is the time to prepare.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.496
Fortunately, our Secretary of Defense,

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.760
Secretary Mattis,
he understands that as well,

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.656
and what he understands
is that climate is a risk.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.136
He has said so in his written
responses to Congress,

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.296
and he says, "As Secretary of Defense,

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.736
it's my job to manage such risks."

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.696
It's not only the US military
that understands this.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.256
Many of our friends and allies
in other navies and other militaries

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.056
have very clear-eyed views
about the climate risk.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.376
And in fact, in 2014, I was honored
to speak for a half-a-day seminar

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.616
at the International Seapower Symposium

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.480
to 70 heads of navies about this issue.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.776
So Winston Churchill
is alleged to have said,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.056
I'm not sure if he said anything,
but he's alleged to have said

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.016
that Americans can always
be counted upon to do the right thing

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.096
after exhausting every other possibility.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.696
(Laughter)

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.936
So I would argue
we're still in the process

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.816
of exhausting every other possibility,

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.416
but I do think we will prevail.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.896
But I need your help.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.176
This is my ask.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.656
I ask not that you take
your recycling out on Wednesday,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.656
but that you engage
with every business leader,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.496
every technology leader,
every government leader,

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.096
and ask them, "Ma'am, sir,

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.800
what are you doing
to stabilize the climate?"

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.056
It's just that simple.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.576
Because when enough people care enough,

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.176
the politicians, most of whom
won't lead on this issue --

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.976
but they will be led --

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.376
that will change this.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.456
Because I can tell you,
the ice doesn't care.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.896
The ice doesn't care
who's in the White House.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.896
It doesn't care which party
controls your congress.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.496
It doesn't care which party
controls your parliament.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.976
It just melts.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.216
Thank you very much.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.160
(Applause)
