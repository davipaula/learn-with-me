00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:17.229
I started life as a fashion designer,

00:00:17.253 --> 00:00:21.486
working closely with textile designers
and fabric suppliers.

00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:27.323
But today, I can no longer see
or talk to my new collaborators,

00:00:27.347 --> 00:00:30.434
because they're in the soil
beneath our feet,

00:00:30.458 --> 00:00:32.846
on the shelves of our supermarkets

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.813
and in the beer I'm going to drink
when I finish this talk.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.299
I'm talking about microbes

00:00:40.323 --> 00:00:42.662
and designing with life.

00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:45.149
Fifteen years ago,

00:00:45.173 --> 00:00:48.379
I completely changed
both what I worked with

00:00:48.403 --> 00:00:49.569
and how I worked

00:00:49.593 --> 00:00:53.061
after a revelatory collaboration
with a biologist.

00:00:53.775 --> 00:00:58.664
Our project gave me
a different perspective on life,

00:00:58.688 --> 00:01:01.811
introducing a whole new
world of possibility

00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:04.958
around how we can design and make things.

00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:09.378
I discovered a radical
manufacturing proposition:

00:01:10.323 --> 00:01:11.679
biofabrication.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:16.251
Literally, fabricating with biology.

00:01:17.212 --> 00:01:18.632
What does that mean?

00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:23.871
Well, instead of processing
plants, animals or oil

00:01:23.895 --> 00:01:26.347
to make consumer materials,

00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:31.991
we might grow materials directly
with living organisms.

00:01:32.618 --> 00:01:36.634
In what many are terming
"the Fourth Industrial Revolution,"

00:01:36.658 --> 00:01:41.178
we're thinking about the new factories
as being living cells.

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:45.504
Bacteria, algae, fungi, yeast:

00:01:45.528 --> 00:01:50.710
our latest design tools
include those of biotechnology.

00:01:51.212 --> 00:01:53.887
My own journey in biofabrication

00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:56.644
started with a project
called "Biocouture."

00:01:57.522 --> 00:02:01.857
The provocation was that instead
of growing a plant, like cotton,

00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:04.174
in a field over several months,

00:02:04.198 --> 00:02:10.481
we could use microbes to grow
a similar cellulose material in a lab

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:11.934
in a few days.

00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:16.577
Using a certain species of bacteria
in a nutrient-rich liquid,

00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:19.982
we fermented threads of cellulose

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:24.188
that self-organized
into a sheet of fabric.

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:27.474
I dried the fabric I had grown

00:02:27.498 --> 00:02:33.110
and cut and sewed it
into a range of garments, shoes and bags.

00:02:33.134 --> 00:02:36.373
In other words,
in one lab we grew materials

00:02:36.397 --> 00:02:38.761
and turned them into a range of products

00:02:38.785 --> 00:02:40.745
in a matter of days.

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.292
And this is in contrast
to currents methods of fabric production,

00:02:45.316 --> 00:02:47.808
where a plant is grown,

00:02:47.832 --> 00:02:50.927
just the cotton part is harvested,

00:02:50.951 --> 00:02:52.736
processed into a yarn,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.529
woven into a fabric

00:02:54.553 --> 00:02:57.307
and then potentially shipped across oceans

00:02:57.331 --> 00:03:00.482
before being cut and sewn into a garment.

00:03:00.506 --> 00:03:03.125
All of that can take months.

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:07.112
So these prototypes indicated a field

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:10.548
offering significant
resource efficiencies.

00:03:10.572 --> 00:03:14.537
From reducing the water,
energy and chemistry needed

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.925
in the production of a material,

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:20.339
through to generating zero waste,

00:03:20.363 --> 00:03:23.926
we grew fabrics to finished form --

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.803
if you like, "biological
additive manufacture."

00:03:29.307 --> 00:03:31.974
Through biofabrication,

00:03:31.998 --> 00:03:36.299
I had replaced many
intensive man-made steps

00:03:36.323 --> 00:03:38.738
with one biological step.

00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:42.155
And as I engaged with this living system,

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:44.446
it transformed my design thinking.

00:03:44.973 --> 00:03:49.234
Here was biology,
with no intervention from me

00:03:49.258 --> 00:03:53.615
other than designing initial
conditions for growth,

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.660
efficiently producing a useful,
sustainable material.

00:03:58.996 --> 00:04:05.782
So now I can't help but see all materials
through the lens of biofabrication.

00:04:05.806 --> 00:04:11.300
In fact, there's a growing
global community of innovators

00:04:11.324 --> 00:04:14.887
rethinking materials with biology.

00:04:15.498 --> 00:04:20.283
Multiple companies are now
growing mushroom materials,

00:04:20.307 --> 00:04:22.236
but not literally mushrooms --

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.371
using mycelium, which is
the root system of fungi,

00:04:27.395 --> 00:04:31.177
to bind together agricultural byproducts.

00:04:31.201 --> 00:04:35.322
It's a process that's been
described as "nature's glue."

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.355
A common way to do this
is to take a 3-D mold,

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:44.831
fill it with a waste crop
like corn stalks or hemp,

00:04:44.855 --> 00:04:46.450
add water,

00:04:46.474 --> 00:04:50.553
wait a few days for the mycelium
to grow throughout,

00:04:50.577 --> 00:04:52.029
remove the mold,

00:04:52.053 --> 00:04:55.327
and you're left with a grown 3-D form.

00:04:56.601 --> 00:05:00.268
Incredibly, we can grow
all kinds of structures

00:05:00.292 --> 00:05:02.688
using living organisms,

00:05:02.712 --> 00:05:06.920
from foams that can replace
plastics in footwear,

00:05:06.944 --> 00:05:09.833
to leather-like materials without animals.

00:05:09.857 --> 00:05:13.730
Furniture, flooring -- all
are currently being prototyped.

00:05:13.754 --> 00:05:19.472
Fungi are able to grow materials
that are naturally fire retardant,

00:05:19.496 --> 00:05:21.336
without any chemicals.

00:05:21.638 --> 00:05:23.368
They're naturally hydrophobic,

00:05:23.392 --> 00:05:25.622
meaning they won't absorb water.

00:05:25.646 --> 00:05:29.107
They have higher melt
temperatures than plastics.

00:05:30.357 --> 00:05:34.801
Polystyrene can take thousands
of years to degrade.

00:05:35.722 --> 00:05:38.252
Mushroom packaging materials

00:05:38.276 --> 00:05:41.950
can be naturally composted
in your back garden

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:44.442
in as little as 30 days.

00:05:45.442 --> 00:05:48.387
Living organisms are transforming waste

00:05:48.411 --> 00:05:52.879
into cost-competitive,
performance-matching materials

00:05:52.903 --> 00:05:55.167
that can start to replace plastics

00:05:55.191 --> 00:05:58.319
and other CO2-emitting materials.

00:05:58.924 --> 00:06:02.543
And once we start growing materials
with living organisms,

00:06:02.567 --> 00:06:08.212
it starts to make previous methods
of manufacture seem illogical.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.451
Take the humble house brick.

00:06:13.007 --> 00:06:16.053
The cement industry generates
around eight percent

00:06:16.077 --> 00:06:17.942
of global CO2 emissions.

00:06:17.966 --> 00:06:21.355
That's more than all the planes
and ships each year.

00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:27.287
The cement process
requires materials to be fired in a kiln

00:06:27.311 --> 00:06:30.506
at over 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:06:31.504 --> 00:06:34.632
Compare this to bioMASON.

00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:39.767
They use a soil microbe
to transform loose aggregates,

00:06:39.791 --> 00:06:42.409
like sand or crushed stone,

00:06:42.433 --> 00:06:46.712
into a biofabricated, or biocement, brick.

00:06:47.028 --> 00:06:50.782
Their process happens at room temperature,

00:06:50.806 --> 00:06:52.837
in just a couple of days.

00:06:52.861 --> 00:06:55.765
Think: hydroponics for bricks.

00:06:55.789 --> 00:07:00.739
An irrigation system
feeds nutrient-rich water

00:07:00.763 --> 00:07:02.660
to trays of bricks

00:07:02.684 --> 00:07:05.353
that have been inoculated with bacteria.

00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:08.260
The bacteria produce crystals

00:07:08.284 --> 00:07:11.346
that form around each grain of sand,

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.553
locking together all the loose particles

00:07:14.577 --> 00:07:16.402
to form a solid brick.

00:07:17.725 --> 00:07:21.074
We can now grow construction materials

00:07:21.098 --> 00:07:23.613
in the elegant way nature does,

00:07:23.637 --> 00:07:25.716
just like a coral reef.

00:07:26.831 --> 00:07:32.434
And these biofabricated bricks
are nearly three times stronger

00:07:32.458 --> 00:07:34.508
than a concrete block.

00:07:35.702 --> 00:07:39.797
And in stark contrast
to traditional cement production,

00:07:39.821 --> 00:07:42.354
they store more carbon than they make.

00:07:43.202 --> 00:07:47.908
So if we could replace
the 1.2 trillion fired bricks

00:07:47.932 --> 00:07:49.607
that are made each year

00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:52.297
with biofabricated bricks,

00:07:52.321 --> 00:07:54.934
we could reduce CO2 emissions

00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:58.762
by 800 million tons every year.

00:08:00.307 --> 00:08:06.747
(Applause)

00:08:08.034 --> 00:08:11.533
Beyond growing materials
with living organisms,

00:08:11.557 --> 00:08:13.938
we're even starting to design products

00:08:13.962 --> 00:08:15.829
that encourage their growth.

00:08:16.338 --> 00:08:18.687
And this comes from the realization

00:08:18.711 --> 00:08:24.211
that the very thing we've been trying
to marginalize -- life --

00:08:24.235 --> 00:08:28.125
might actually be
our greatest collaborator.

00:08:28.689 --> 00:08:32.538
To that end, we've been
exploring all the ways

00:08:32.562 --> 00:08:36.640
that we can grow healthy microbes
in our own ecosystems.

00:08:37.482 --> 00:08:41.713
A great example of this is architects

00:08:41.737 --> 00:08:45.499
who are imagining the skin of a building

00:08:45.523 --> 00:08:48.324
to function like the bark of a tree.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.627
But not as a cosmetic green layer.

00:08:51.982 --> 00:08:55.252
They're designing architectural barks

00:08:55.276 --> 00:08:59.262
as hosts for evolving ecologies.

00:09:00.104 --> 00:09:05.730
These surface structures
are designed to invite life in.

00:09:06.239 --> 00:09:11.649
And if we applied the same energy
we currently do suppressing forms of life

00:09:11.673 --> 00:09:14.649
towards cultivating life,

00:09:14.673 --> 00:09:18.400
we'd turn the negative image
of the urban jungle

00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:23.940
into one that literally embodies
a thriving, living ecosystem.

00:09:24.734 --> 00:09:30.656
By actively encouraging surface
interactions with healthy microbes,

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.688
we could improve passive climate control,

00:09:33.712 --> 00:09:35.545
stormwater management

00:09:35.569 --> 00:09:37.704
and even reduce CO2 emissions

00:09:37.728 --> 00:09:41.743
by lowering the energy
used to heat or cool our buildings.

00:09:42.847 --> 00:09:46.943
We're just beginning
to realize the potential

00:09:46.967 --> 00:09:50.117
of nature-based technologies.

00:09:50.141 --> 00:09:55.164
I'm excited that we're starting
to design and biofabricate

00:09:55.188 --> 00:09:57.442
a new material world.

00:10:01.177 --> 00:10:05.438
It's one that moves away
from the exploitation

00:10:05.462 --> 00:10:07.915
of nonrenewable resources

00:10:07.939 --> 00:10:12.275
to working with the original,
renewable life.

00:10:12.819 --> 00:10:14.871
Instead of designing out life,

00:10:14.895 --> 00:10:18.259
we're designing with it and for it.

00:10:18.934 --> 00:10:22.968
Packaging, fashion, footwear,
furniture, construction --

00:10:22.992 --> 00:10:28.143
biofabricated products can be grown
close to centers of demand,

00:10:28.167 --> 00:10:31.937
with local resources, less land, energy,

00:10:31.961 --> 00:10:35.837
and even harnessing
industrial waste streams.

00:10:36.924 --> 00:10:40.925
It used to be that the tools
of biotechnology

00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:43.316
were the preserve of powerful,

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.528
multinational chemical
and biotech companies.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:52.061
In the last century,
we expected material innovation

00:10:52.085 --> 00:10:56.593
to come from the likes
of DuPont, Dow, BASF.

00:10:57.173 --> 00:11:03.180
But this 21st-century material revolution
is being led by start-ups

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:06.347
with small teams and limited capital.

00:11:06.903 --> 00:11:10.617
And by the way, not all their founders
have science degrees.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:15.363
They include artists,
architects and designers.

00:11:16.538 --> 00:11:20.292
Over a billion dollars
has already been invested

00:11:20.316 --> 00:11:24.260
in start-ups biofabricating
consumer products.

00:11:25.316 --> 00:11:29.763
I don't think we have a choice
but to biofabricate our future.

00:11:30.938 --> 00:11:32.422
From the jacket you're wearing

00:11:32.446 --> 00:11:34.002
to the chair you're sitting in

00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:35.748
to the home you live in,

00:11:35.772 --> 00:11:41.355
your designed material world
shouldn't compromise your health

00:11:41.379 --> 00:11:43.251
or that of our planet.

00:11:43.879 --> 00:11:45.879
If materials can't be recycled

00:11:45.903 --> 00:11:48.442
or naturally composted at home,

00:11:48.466 --> 00:11:49.974
we should reject them.

00:11:49.998 --> 00:11:54.537
I'm committed to making
this future a reality

00:11:54.561 --> 00:11:58.203
by shining a light on all the amazing work

00:11:58.227 --> 00:11:59.759
being done today

00:11:59.783 --> 00:12:02.791
and by facilitating more interactions

00:12:02.815 --> 00:12:07.255
between designers, scientists,
investors and brands.

00:12:07.581 --> 00:12:10.747
Because we need a material revolution,

00:12:10.771 --> 00:12:12.397
and we need it now.

00:12:12.914 --> 00:12:14.088
Thank you.

00:12:14.112 --> 00:12:18.577
(Applause)
